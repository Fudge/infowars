[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:21.400]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:21.400 --> 00:31.160]  All right, good morning on this Monday, June 10th, 2013. Yes, the NSA spy scandal, it's
[00:31.160 --> 00:37.160]  all true. They are listening to your phone calls. They are reading your emails. They
[00:37.160 --> 00:44.200]  are getting your logins, your passwords, your texts, chats, your files, everything you store
[00:44.200 --> 00:51.040]  in the online cloud is being scanned. It's all true. All the denials are complete lies.
[00:51.040 --> 00:55.360]  They've all been caught, the tech companies caught in their lies by the slides of the
[00:55.360 --> 01:01.840]  PRISM program released now by Edward Snowden, who has just stepped forward yesterday to
[01:01.840 --> 01:07.240]  claim responsibility for leaking these slides to The Guardian and The Washington Post. And
[01:07.240 --> 01:12.660]  this is the subject of our show today. We're going to have three guests on today. This
[01:12.660 --> 01:18.280]  is the Alex Jones show. We're gonna have Jim Mars joining in with some historical analysis
[01:18.280 --> 01:22.080]  and context of this outrageous spy program.
[01:22.080 --> 01:27.880]  We're also gonna have John Rappaport on in the second hour. He's gonna be joining us
[01:27.880 --> 01:32.900]  to give us some more information about Snowden himself and the nature of the spy program
[01:32.900 --> 01:37.460]  and what else they might be watching and listening to that hasn't yet been reported. And in the
[01:37.460 --> 01:43.360]  third hour, we've got Texas Representative Steve Stockman on. He has been outraged by
[01:43.360 --> 01:48.720]  these confirmed reports of the NSA spying program. And he's been putting out some hilarious
[01:48.720 --> 01:55.000]  tweets calling out the Obama administration, which, if you recall, promised in 2007 that
[01:55.000 --> 01:57.720]  it was gonna be the administration of transparency.
[01:57.720 --> 02:02.640]  Yeah, we weren't gonna have government secrets anymore. The government was gonna answer to
[02:02.640 --> 02:09.260]  the people. Well, guess what? That was all a big lie too. It's just lies within lies
[02:09.260 --> 02:14.480]  within lies. Now, if you're not familiar with this subject yet, let me just break it down
[02:14.480 --> 02:23.600]  for you very quickly. Ed Snowden, a 29-year-old senior intelligence analyst, a computer, you
[02:23.600 --> 02:27.440]  might call him a geek, but a genius geek who worked for the CIA.
[02:27.440 --> 02:33.280]  And then he worked for a contractor that was providing services to the NSA. He leaked details
[02:33.280 --> 02:39.320]  of the program to The Guardian and did an interview with Glenn Greenwald, an actual
[02:39.320 --> 02:43.680]  journalist. Yes, they still exist. And he's one of them, apparently. And The Guardian
[02:43.680 --> 02:48.240]  published this, and so did The Washington Post over the last few days. And then yesterday,
[02:48.240 --> 02:54.240]  a video was distributed by The Guardian that is an interview between Glenn Greenwald and
[02:54.240 --> 03:00.960]  Ed Snowden, the whistleblower, that gave all the details, fascinating, amazing details.
[03:00.960 --> 03:09.800]  Check out these quotes of what you heard in the video which describes quote, turnkey tyranny.
[03:09.800 --> 03:15.400]  He says, quote, we collect more digital communications from America than we do from the Russians.
[03:15.400 --> 03:22.040]  He says, any analyst at any time can target anyone, any selector anywhere. I, sitting
[03:22.040 --> 03:27.680]  at my desk, certainly had the authorities to wiretap anyone from you or your accountant
[03:27.680 --> 03:31.860]  to a federal judge, to even the president.
[03:31.860 --> 03:37.600]  These are the words of Edward Snowden, the whistleblower who is now hiding out in Hong
[03:37.600 --> 03:45.840]  Kong and knows that they're gonna try to kill him. He is reportedly seeking asylum in Iceland,
[03:45.840 --> 03:51.280]  and we do have some breaking news for you on that coming up right after this break where
[03:51.280 --> 03:56.020]  Iceland appears to be welcoming him to seek political asylum there. There's an article
[03:56.020 --> 04:01.200]  about that on Infowars.com right now by Kurt Nemo, so check that out.
[04:01.200 --> 04:06.100]  But that's the focus of today's show, everything about the NSA spy grid. We're gonna break
[04:06.100 --> 04:13.880]  it down for you of what they're scanning, what they're snooping into. Speaking of snoop,
[04:13.880 --> 04:19.920]  we gotta get to some of Leno's quotes about the Obama administration. He says, yeah, snoop
[04:19.920 --> 04:23.640]  is back in the news, not snoop dog, snoop Obama.
[04:23.640 --> 04:28.120]  Leno's had some good lines lately. He said, hey, forget about big brother watching you.
[04:28.120 --> 04:34.960]  Now, we actually have a brother watching you. That's Leno's quote. Some very funny but poignant
[04:34.960 --> 04:39.440]  comedy from Leno on that. We've got other quotes coming up. Great guests straight ahead
[04:39.440 --> 04:45.320]  plus more analysis and breakdown of this exploding spy scandal from the NSA that exposes the
[04:45.320 --> 04:48.820]  lies and the deceptions of big government.
[04:48.820 --> 04:52.520]  This is the Alex Jones show. We'll be right back with all that and much more. So stay
[04:52.520 --> 05:00.600]  with us a lot straight ahead.

[08:08.360 --> 08:11.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[08:11.200 --> 08:17.680]  All right, welcome back. This is the Alex Jones Show on Monday, June 10th, 2013. This
[08:17.680 --> 08:22.380]  is Mike Adams, the Health Ranger filling in for Alex who is traveling right now. He's
[08:22.380 --> 08:27.960]  actually on an airplane arriving in a few hours here in the United States back from
[08:27.960 --> 08:32.160]  the Bilderberg Conference in the UK. Lots of excitement there. Of course, lots of coverage
[08:32.160 --> 08:37.620]  of that over the past few days and all of last week here at Infowars Studios.
[08:37.620 --> 08:43.620]  But now we're covering the NSA spy scandal, the explosive revelations that have been emerging
[08:43.620 --> 08:47.780]  now throughout even the mainstream media, The Guardian, The Washington Post, and now
[08:47.780 --> 08:52.580]  hundreds if not thousands of mainstream media sources covering this explosive news, which
[08:52.580 --> 08:59.420]  revealed the top secret slides, the slideshow that revealed the government is spying on
[08:59.420 --> 09:04.520]  everything you do, your phone calls, your emails, your login passwords, your online
[09:04.520 --> 09:09.140]  storage files, your photos, your social media networking posts.
[09:09.140 --> 09:19.100]  Everything is being spied on routinely, wholesale copied, archived, data mined, relationally
[09:19.100 --> 09:24.040]  looked at. I don't know the right word for it. The intelligence community is basically
[09:24.040 --> 09:28.500]  looking at your data every way they can to get as much information out of it so that
[09:28.500 --> 09:34.220]  they can nail you for things that are otherwise innocent.
[09:34.220 --> 09:39.340]  And I want to get your comments on this because there's a lot of outrage out there. I want
[09:39.340 --> 09:44.060]  to get callers today. I haven't had many callers in the last couple of times that I've hosted.
[09:44.060 --> 09:51.020]  So call in 800-259-9231. We'd like to get you on the show to hear your comments. We're
[09:51.020 --> 09:58.620]  going to move quickly between calls. So have a short comment ready, please. 800-259-9231.
[09:58.620 --> 10:03.180]  And we'll start taking your calls here in just a few minutes. Also coming up today on
[10:03.180 --> 10:08.100]  the show, we've got great guests lined up for you. Author and researcher Jim Mars will
[10:08.100 --> 10:12.460]  be joining us at the bottom of this hour. And in the next hour, we've got John Rappaport
[10:12.460 --> 10:17.500]  with additional analysis of just how damaging this is to the international surveillance
[10:17.500 --> 10:24.100]  spy community. Damaging them, but freedom for us because you see, it's exposing the
[10:24.100 --> 10:28.940]  lies and the hypocrisy of government where Obama claimed it was all going to be fully
[10:28.940 --> 10:29.940]  transparent.
[10:29.940 --> 10:33.060]  We're not going to keep any secrets from you. We're going to be honest with you. We're going
[10:33.060 --> 10:38.260]  to work to protect your interests and your rights, blah, blah, blah. All lies, all coming
[10:38.260 --> 10:42.700]  out now. So many scandals. Another day, another scandal in the White House. In fact, there's
[10:42.700 --> 10:47.500]  even a scandal about the State Department that has broken today. It's up on DrudgeReport.com
[10:47.500 --> 10:50.100]  right now if you want to check that out.
[10:50.100 --> 10:53.700]  We're not even going to cover that today because we're so focused on last week's scandals and
[10:53.700 --> 10:59.300]  the weekend scandals and the NSA spying scandal. Another day, another scandal. It's the IRS.
[10:59.300 --> 11:05.380]  It's the Department of Justice. It's the EPA. It's the NSA. It's like another day, another
[11:05.380 --> 11:12.740]  piece of the alphabet gets exposed as being total criminal lying corrupt outfit. It's
[11:12.740 --> 11:13.740]  unbelievable.
[11:13.740 --> 11:16.620]  Here are some things that you need to know and then we're going to go to your phone calls
[11:16.620 --> 11:21.140]  which are already coming in. We're going to go to you just in a minute there, Taylor and
[11:21.140 --> 11:26.300]  Houston and others. The big lies. Here are the big lies about all this that you need
[11:26.300 --> 11:30.980]  to know. Number one, the government claimed it wasn't listening to your phone calls. Those
[11:30.980 --> 11:34.820]  are Obama's words. We're not listening to your phone calls or he said no one is listening
[11:34.820 --> 11:35.980]  to your phone calls.
[11:35.980 --> 11:39.340]  They are listening to your phone calls. They're recording all of your phone calls. They're
[11:39.340 --> 11:46.460]  parsing them with actual recognition software that can listen to the words and create a
[11:46.460 --> 11:51.700]  text transcript and then data mine the text transcript. That's what they're doing. The
[11:51.700 --> 11:59.820]  second big lie, the tech companies came out. Apple, Google, Microsoft, Yahoo Mail, AOL,
[11:59.820 --> 12:05.060]  Skype and others. They all came out and said, no, the government doesn't have direct access
[12:05.060 --> 12:11.080]  to our servers. That's not true. That's a big lie. Well, they're parsing words. They're
[12:11.080 --> 12:16.100]  using lawyer speak. It turns out even if the government didn't have direct access to the
[12:16.100 --> 12:21.660]  servers, they have side door access, maybe not back door, but side door access.
[12:21.660 --> 12:25.700]  All those companies push the data over to out a side door and then the government picks
[12:25.700 --> 12:32.900]  it up from there. But then Sunday, another top secret slide was released by the Guardian,
[12:32.900 --> 12:39.480]  which showed directly that, in fact, the government has direct server access. It's right there
[12:39.480 --> 12:45.280]  in the slide. It says we have direct server access to Google, Apple, Yahoo and others.
[12:45.280 --> 12:49.660]  They have it. It's there. It's confirmed from the slide.
[12:49.660 --> 12:54.860]  So these companies are required by law to lie to you. All these tech companies, they
[12:54.860 --> 12:58.780]  have to lie to you or they will go to jail because that's part of the Foreign Intelligence
[12:58.780 --> 13:03.580]  Surveillance Act. FISA, if they don't lie, they go to jail. So of course they're lying
[13:03.580 --> 13:09.540]  to you. Everybody is lying to you, okay? Obama has been lying to you. Feinstein and the Intelligence
[13:09.540 --> 13:11.540]  Committee lying to you.
[13:11.540 --> 13:17.540]  The tech companies lying to you while they read your emails. And the NSA lying to you.
[13:17.540 --> 13:22.780]  They're all lying to you. And by now, more and more people are finally waking up and
[13:22.780 --> 13:28.180]  figuring that out. And finally, the last big lie before we go to the phone calls, Obama
[13:28.180 --> 13:34.500]  has been defending all of this, astoundingly, because he's the guy who said we were gonna
[13:34.500 --> 13:35.780]  have full transparency.
[13:35.780 --> 13:40.600]  And then all this happens under his watch and he didn't shut it down. He didn't eliminate
[13:40.600 --> 13:47.580]  these programs. He carried on the Bush era Patriot Act surveillance regime and made it
[13:47.580 --> 13:54.660]  worse. Obama is worse than Bush on spying on Americans. But he says, quote, I think
[13:54.660 --> 14:00.620]  we've struck the right balance. The right balance, Obama says, what balance is that
[14:00.620 --> 14:04.100]  where the government spies on everything that we do?
[14:04.100 --> 14:09.740]  But if we go out and videotape a police officer on a public street, we go to jail and get
[14:09.740 --> 14:16.840]  prosecuted for wiretapping? But the government can wiretap us 24-7 in complete violation
[14:16.840 --> 14:21.960]  of the Fourth Amendment without even a warrant, without even any suspicion of you. They can
[14:21.960 --> 14:30.300]  track everything you do online. That's a balance, Obama. You're a sociopath. You're insane.
[14:30.300 --> 14:36.420]  That's not balance. Balance would be the government tracks only people that they know have a reason
[14:36.420 --> 14:37.420]  to be tracked.
[14:37.420 --> 14:41.400]  They get a warrant. They get a specific person. They get a name. This person, they say, might
[14:41.400 --> 14:45.340]  be a criminal, might be a terrorist. They get a warrant. I don't have any problem with
[14:45.340 --> 14:50.340]  that. That's perfectly okay with me. You get a warrant, you can track them. But to wholesale
[14:50.340 --> 14:59.100]  track everybody, even innocent people, and then call it a balance, Obama, you're insane.
[14:59.100 --> 15:02.620]  You're a sociopath, all right? That's absolute insanity.
[15:02.620 --> 15:07.500]  Let's go to the calls and get some other public opinion on this. Taylor from Houston, thank
[15:07.500 --> 15:10.340]  you for calling in. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[15:10.340 --> 15:17.660]  Oh, you know, Mike, they called us crazy. It's such a flip flop that now we're the
[15:17.660 --> 15:23.500]  ones that are on the attack and they're the ones that are on the defensive. What just
[15:23.500 --> 15:29.700]  astounds me is the audacity of these people to look at somebody sitting right across them
[15:29.700 --> 15:35.200]  in a courtroom or in a transcripted meeting and sit there and pull out documents and show
[15:35.200 --> 15:38.820]  them like, no, here's the evidence. This is what you're doing. They can just look right
[15:38.820 --> 15:44.180]  back to me. Right. Total, total denial. And you're absolutely
[15:44.180 --> 15:50.820]  right. We, the alternative media, the info warriors, we have been right all along. Think
[15:50.820 --> 15:56.580]  about that. How far back has Alex been warning people about this exact scenario? He said
[15:56.580 --> 16:02.260]  the government's reading your emails and they said he was crazy. Your thoughts?
[16:02.260 --> 16:06.380]  That's exactly right. And I'm tired of being the one that's called crazy. If I was the
[16:06.380 --> 16:10.020]  one sitting up there across from the courtroom with those people, I would slam my hand down
[16:10.020 --> 16:14.620]  on that desk and say, no, you're the ones that are lying to us. I'm tired of listening
[16:14.620 --> 16:17.820]  to your crap. Absolutely. Good, good call, Taylor. Thank
[16:17.820 --> 16:23.620]  you for calling in. Let's go to DC in West Virginia. I guess that's the name DC. You're
[16:23.620 --> 16:28.620]  on the air on the Alex Jones show. Go ahead. Mike Adams, the man, what's going on? I know
[16:28.620 --> 16:32.180]  he's going to try to get as many calls as possible, so I will be quick. I just want
[16:32.180 --> 16:36.380]  to say I went to last year's Buddha bird and as an American, I'm a little disappointed
[16:36.380 --> 16:42.660]  now to see the great protesters over there in the UK. When I saw the strings, it looked
[16:42.660 --> 16:47.700]  like they had a good couple of thousand people. Maybe a couple of hundred, but that's okay.
[16:47.700 --> 16:52.940]  We're glad people are waking up. And real quick, one day I'm really hoping that you
[16:52.940 --> 17:00.020]  could do, it's not a whole show, maybe a YouTube or something on the vaccinations because I've
[17:00.020 --> 17:04.900]  got a little baby. We have not given him the hep B yet because I don't believe in the hep
[17:04.900 --> 17:09.540]  B. And then he's got his 10 months coming up soon. So I'm really, really, really trying
[17:09.540 --> 17:13.300]  to wake his mother up. Well, DC, good for you. You sound like a very
[17:13.300 --> 17:18.500]  compassionate, concerned and responsible parent who wants to learn more about vaccines. We
[17:18.500 --> 17:23.900]  will cover that on future shows. I will cover that in more detail on future shows. Today,
[17:23.900 --> 17:28.140]  we're focusing on the NSA, the explosive spy scandal. I'm sure you understand that, but
[17:28.140 --> 17:32.340]  we will continue to cover vaccines because the truth has to come out on all these issues.
[17:32.340 --> 17:38.100]  GMOs, vaccines, radiation, the chemtrails, you name it. And it's all going to come out.
[17:38.100 --> 17:41.380]  It's coming out now. So thank you for your comments, DC. We'll keep that in mind as we
[17:41.380 --> 17:46.260]  plan future shows. Let's go to JB in Alabama. Go ahead, JB, you're on the air on the Alex
[17:46.260 --> 17:50.660]  Jones show. Hey, thanks for taking my call, Mike. Really,
[17:50.660 --> 17:55.340]  I want to ask the question, because I see a great business opportunity here. Where is
[17:55.340 --> 18:01.540]  the company that's going to come in and set up a system with encrypted everything and
[18:01.540 --> 18:07.300]  not make a key? You're absolutely right. People want information, they hand them the paper
[18:07.300 --> 18:12.260]  with all this just garbled gunk on it and they say, there you go.
[18:12.260 --> 18:16.660]  There is a billion dollar opportunity here for a company to set that up. You're exactly
[18:16.660 --> 18:21.940]  right. Very, very insightful. We need a social media network that guarantees it doesn't share
[18:21.940 --> 18:26.940]  information with the government. We need an online email system that guarantees that now
[18:26.940 --> 18:31.020]  there may be these systems that exist. I've actually tried to look into some of them.
[18:31.020 --> 18:34.460]  The things I found so far are a little clunky or a little difficult to use. So somebody
[18:34.460 --> 18:39.440]  needs to make an easy to use streamline system and it would be a multibillion dollar opportunity.
[18:39.440 --> 18:43.740]  The the you know, like the the hushmail of social networking, something like that. Very
[18:43.740 --> 18:49.740]  good point, JB. Thank you for your call. Let's go on to whistleblower number nine in Texas.
[18:49.740 --> 18:53.220]  And I guess we skipped one through eight. But let's go to whistleblower number nine.
[18:53.220 --> 18:56.300]  Thank you for your call. Thanks, Mike. Frankly, I've been banned from
[18:56.300 --> 18:59.820]  City Hall and twice now banned from local commissioners court.
[18:59.820 --> 19:05.780]  Oh, yes. This reefer seed. You got it. Yeah. Yeah. I recognize your voice. I know, man.
[19:05.780 --> 19:07.780]  They're shutting you out of everything. What's going on?
[19:07.780 --> 19:12.980]  Well, they banned me from the local commissioners court and this time for 16 weeks because I
[19:12.980 --> 19:18.620]  happened to object to a preliminary question. It was, you know, belittling and harassing
[19:18.620 --> 19:22.340]  me. He said, I'm sitting there literally on stage for a half hour taking notes. And he
[19:22.340 --> 19:25.980]  said, OK, Mr. Reaver said, you've got something relevant to say.
[19:25.980 --> 19:30.260]  Yeah, I know. They hate the fact that you want to actually express your First Amendment
[19:30.260 --> 19:35.420]  rights there at City Hall. It's unbelievable. Well, I wonder what they think now that all
[19:35.420 --> 19:39.620]  this is coming out, that basically everything that you and others in the alternative media
[19:39.620 --> 19:43.820]  have been saying, it's all true. So maybe they should listen up. We should banish them
[19:43.820 --> 19:46.340]  from City Hall. We should banish them. Yeah, exactly.
[19:46.340 --> 19:51.740]  And my message is, don't give up. Keep talking truth to these criminals. Nixon's IRS credit
[19:51.740 --> 19:54.340]  for minor. That's right, reefer seed. Thank you for your

[23:57.100 --> 24:13.920]  All right, we're continuing. This is the Alex Jones Show. Thank you for joining us. We're
[24:13.920 --> 24:20.940]  covering the explosive NSA spy scandal. It's been breaking in the news globally over the
[24:20.940 --> 24:27.700]  last, well, roughly 36 hours or so, especially since the whistleblower Ed Snowden stepped
[24:27.700 --> 24:32.860]  forward and claimed responsibility for breaking that information to The Guardian and The Washington
[24:32.860 --> 24:38.420]  Post. Now Snowden, it turns out, is a Ron Paul supporter. See, this is the Ron Paul
[24:38.420 --> 24:45.460]  revolution continuing. Gotta thank Ron Paul for inspiring people to recognize when terrible
[24:45.460 --> 24:51.580]  government abuses are taking place right under their nose. And Snowden did see what was happening
[24:51.580 --> 24:57.020]  and he sounded the alarm at great risk to himself. But let's go to his actual words
[24:57.020 --> 25:02.460]  as he describes what he saw happening as a senior intelligence analyst working essentially
[25:02.460 --> 25:07.380]  for the NSA. This is an interview conducted by Glenn Greenwald for The Guardian. Let's
[25:07.380 --> 25:09.940]  hear what Snowden has to say.
[25:09.940 --> 25:16.740]  Any analyst at any time can target anyone, any selector, anywhere. Where those communications
[25:16.740 --> 25:20.700]  will be picked up depends on the range of the sensor networks and the authorities that
[25:20.700 --> 25:26.060]  that analyst is empowered with. Not all analysts have the ability to target everything. But
[25:26.060 --> 25:32.180]  I, sitting at my desk, certainly have the authorities to wiretap anyone from you or
[25:32.180 --> 25:36.700]  your accountant to a federal judge to even the president if I had a personal email.
[25:36.700 --> 25:37.700]  One of the-
[25:37.700 --> 25:40.940]  All right, so that's the key section right there, that he had the authority to wiretap
[25:40.940 --> 25:47.860]  a federal judge or you or anyone, even the president. You see, the power of the system,
[25:47.860 --> 25:52.900]  this is not about catching terrorists. This is a system that can be used to get dirt on
[25:52.900 --> 25:58.760]  anyone in America because everybody's got secrets. So you can get dirt on a congressman,
[25:58.760 --> 26:03.480]  you can get dirt on a senator, you can get dirt on a CEO. You can find something that
[26:03.480 --> 26:10.380]  somebody is embarrassed about, some chat, some emails, some files, some voicemail, some
[26:10.380 --> 26:11.700]  phone call.
[26:11.700 --> 26:15.440]  And you can use it against them in a blackmail operation where the NSA would essentially
[26:15.440 --> 26:24.000]  control all the power in the country, underground power. Not the overt democracy, but covert
[26:24.000 --> 26:28.940]  power through blackmail and influence. So that's a very big deal and it's a very dangerous
[26:28.940 --> 26:35.660]  situation to have any agency with that much power. Almost omniscience, the power of God
[26:35.660 --> 26:39.420]  to listen and watch what you do, but not the ethics of God.
[26:39.420 --> 26:44.900]  The power of God, but the ethics of Satan, basically, is what the NSA is. So let's continue
[26:44.900 --> 26:51.900]  with phone calls. Let's go to Aaron in Nevada. Aaron, you're on the air. Go ahead, sir.
[26:51.900 --> 27:00.660]  Oh, but it's not only the government. It just happened up here. We got this string of grocery
[27:00.660 --> 27:06.540]  stores called Raley's. What happened was is that they had their database hacked at the
[27:06.540 --> 27:11.820]  corporate level. And what happens is that when you're a customer and you swipe your
[27:11.820 --> 27:20.080]  debit card, your ATM card, your credit card, all of that information is stored on the grocery
[27:20.080 --> 27:26.740]  stores, in this case, database. And they know this. So the hackers go in and they steal
[27:26.740 --> 27:33.220]  all of that information. How I found out about it was I got a call from a credit card company,
[27:33.220 --> 27:38.380]  which I used to buy my groceries, and they told me, yeah, this is what happened. They
[27:38.380 --> 27:43.020]  told me all the details and they said, we're going to have to send you out some new cards.
[27:43.020 --> 27:47.100]  They haven't tried to use your number and account information yet, but they could.
[27:47.100 --> 27:51.100]  Well, you're exactly right, Aaron. That's a good point. But there have been many, many
[27:51.100 --> 27:55.060]  cases of corporations having their databases hacked and credit cards stolen that you're
[27:55.060 --> 27:59.060]  right about that. And that is one thing that's bad. But what we're dealing with with this
[27:59.060 --> 28:05.260]  NSA spy scandal is companies that voluntarily turn over your details to the federal government
[28:05.260 --> 28:09.860]  without revealing it to their customers. So that's a violation of federal law. It's a
[28:09.860 --> 28:15.800]  violation of Constitution. It's also a violation of their terms of service agreements with
[28:15.800 --> 28:19.460]  their own users. But thank you for your call. I'm glad you brought that up. Basically, your
[28:19.460 --> 28:24.620]  credit card information is not safe anywhere. Let's take another call. Haboo in Wisconsin.
[28:24.620 --> 28:28.220]  Haboo, you are on the air on the Alex Jones show. Go ahead.
[28:28.220 --> 28:35.140]  Well, thank you. Good to talk to you. Just three very quick points. One, President Obama's
[28:35.140 --> 28:41.460]  remarks on Friday in response to this whole revelation were nothing short of a collection
[28:41.460 --> 28:48.220]  of sophistries and lies. Absolutely. Yeah. Two, this is a seminal moment for American
[28:48.220 --> 28:53.780]  people. While we were aware of this kind of spying, we didn't realize the breadth and
[28:53.780 --> 29:01.300]  depth and the extent and thoroughness of this. This is almost dystopian completely. So it's
[29:01.300 --> 29:06.060]  a time for Americans to rally around the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. It isn't a Republican
[29:06.060 --> 29:12.720]  or Democrat matter. And lastly, this is a question I haven't heard answered or even
[29:12.720 --> 29:18.500]  brought up. For the longest time, we were told about this program saying, well, it goes
[29:18.500 --> 29:24.180]  through the courts and all that. And we were kind of made to feel good about it. But I
[29:24.180 --> 29:30.340]  mean, one has to wonder, how can a court authorize for phone companies to-
[29:30.340 --> 29:34.100]  Illegal acts. Yeah, exactly. For millions. For millions.
[29:34.100 --> 29:37.780]  Really good points, Habu. We got to go to break, but I thank you for your call. Really
[29:37.780 --> 29:42.580]  good points. Very coherent arguments there. We must rally to restore the Republican. Rand
[29:42.580 --> 29:46.380]  Paul is actually introducing a bill to restore the Fourth Amendment. So we'll talk about
[29:46.380 --> 29:49.820]  that and play that video from Rand Paul later. Stay with us.
[29:49.820 --> 30:00.460]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[32:03.460 --> 32:08.540]  I was eating. I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working. My body was literally
[32:08.540 --> 32:13.380]  starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins. And as soon as I had
[32:13.380 --> 32:19.180]  that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.

[33:28.740 --> 33:35.420]  health ranger filling in for Alex Jones today, who is on an airplane actually getting, getting
[33:35.420 --> 33:40.340]  back to the United States after protesting Bilderberg and callers. Please stay on the
[33:40.340 --> 33:44.500]  line. We are going to go ahead and take some of your calls as Jim Mars joins us. I'd like
[33:44.500 --> 33:50.100]  to direct some of your questions to Jim. Now, Jim Mars is a legendary researcher, author,
[33:50.100 --> 33:54.780]  writer, true. You might call him an old school journalist and the fact that, gee, he checks
[33:54.780 --> 34:00.460]  his facts, you know, real journalism. He doesn't just parrot whatever press releases handed
[34:00.460 --> 34:04.560]  to him by the White House. He actually checks his facts. He's got a number of fantastic
[34:04.560 --> 34:09.640]  books out there, including his most recent one, our occulted history. And what the sub
[34:09.640 --> 34:14.420]  line on that is do the global elite conceal ancient aliens? But it's actually about much
[34:14.420 --> 34:19.260]  more than ancient aliens. It's about lost civilizations. It's about buried technology.
[34:19.260 --> 34:23.340]  It's about systems of control. It's not a book about aliens. It's about much more. And
[34:23.340 --> 34:28.100]  Jim Mars joins us now on the Alex Jones show to give us his analysis of what's happening
[34:28.100 --> 34:34.060]  with Snowden, the whistleblower and the explosive NSA spy grid scandal that's now breaking big
[34:34.060 --> 34:38.740]  all over the world. Jim, welcome to the show. Hey Mike, it's a pleasure to be with you.
[34:38.740 --> 34:44.060]  Uh, yeah, I find it real interesting because I'm old enough to have gone through the, uh,
[34:44.060 --> 34:49.780]  Pentagon papers, uh, scandal thing. And I remember when that first broke and everybody's
[34:49.780 --> 34:55.140]  going, oh, well, there's nothing to that, but don't, don't mind the man behind the curtain.
[34:55.140 --> 35:01.020]  And of course that resulted in the resignation of a president. Uh, we keep our fingers crossed
[35:01.020 --> 35:06.340]  that something similar might happen on this thing if we keep the story in front of us.
[35:06.340 --> 35:11.460]  And I think the key thing to remember is, is that Ed Snowden basically is not telling
[35:11.460 --> 35:19.900]  us anything that so many of us knew already. It's what he's doing is giving inside confirmation
[35:19.900 --> 35:25.740]  to the fact that your government spies on you. Okay. And it has nothing to do with security
[35:25.740 --> 35:33.220]  because the whole war on terrorism is basically a fraud anyway, because yes, there are foreign
[35:33.220 --> 35:38.580]  people who would like to harm the United States, but if left to their own devices, they probably
[35:38.580 --> 35:44.420]  couldn't afford to rent a camel to get over here. Right. Well, this is actually are the
[35:44.420 --> 35:52.540]  people who are, uh, uh, leading, uh, and ordering about people like Ed Snowden. Well, Jim Snowden
[35:52.540 --> 35:56.700]  actually addressed to some of what you said there. He says that when this first began,
[35:56.700 --> 36:04.100]  the FISA program did mostly focused on foreigners, you know, not non-Americans, but he says increasingly
[36:04.100 --> 36:10.220]  it was turned that entire security apparatus, the spy grid was turned against Americans
[36:10.220 --> 36:17.580]  and is now used domestically. And this is his quote. He says, now that we, we gather
[36:17.580 --> 36:22.540]  more information, where's that actual quote, more information from Americans than we do
[36:22.540 --> 36:28.500]  from the Russians. So, I mean, come on, this is a U S spy grid now. Right. Well, and I'll
[36:28.500 --> 36:33.700]  tell you, if you really stop and look at it and back off and you, the big picture was
[36:33.700 --> 36:40.060]  very, very disturbing to me is that when I was a young man, if you spoke about the constitution
[36:40.060 --> 36:47.460]  and the Republic and, and, uh, true liberty and freedom, you were considered a Patriot
[36:47.460 --> 36:52.980]  and you were considered a fine upstanding American today, according to material that's
[36:52.980 --> 36:59.060]  been put out by the Obama administration and passed around to police departments and other
[36:59.060 --> 37:05.980]  law enforcement by the, uh, fusion centers. If you speak about the constitution and if
[37:05.980 --> 37:11.700]  you support the freedom and liberty and criticize the government, you're some kind of a potential
[37:11.700 --> 37:18.340]  terrorist. I mean, where are we going folks? It's worse than the McCarthy era. Well, let's
[37:18.340 --> 37:23.820]  talk about that because you have written about JFK extensively. You, in fact, you've researched
[37:23.820 --> 37:29.780]  the JFK assassination more than anyone. So you can actually give us a historical context
[37:29.780 --> 37:36.340]  of this. Can you compare this today to the Nixon Watergate scandal? Can you give us a,
[37:36.340 --> 37:42.640]  a sense of scale of how much bigger and how much more dangerous this NSA spy scandal is
[37:42.640 --> 37:48.220]  compared to what Nixon did? Well, yes. And again, because with Nixon and Watergate, you're
[37:48.220 --> 37:54.100]  just dealing with a corrupt president who was, uh, using the, uh, arm of the federal
[37:54.100 --> 38:01.380]  government to attack his political enemies. Uh, today they are attacking everybody. Okay.
[38:01.380 --> 38:08.140]  And by the way, people should be cognizant of the fact that, uh, Watergate was a presidential
[38:08.140 --> 38:14.300]  assassination. All right. It was, in fact, it was an extension of the Kennedy assassination.
[38:14.300 --> 38:19.620]  The big difference of course was that Kennedy was physically killed while Nixon was just
[38:19.620 --> 38:25.940]  politically killed. And both of them were orchestrated. Uh, it's like one of the members
[38:25.940 --> 38:31.540]  of the infamous Warren commission, uh, was bemoaning the fact. He said, we, we have to
[38:31.540 --> 38:37.580]  show the world that the United States is not just another banana Republic, right? Okay.
[38:37.580 --> 38:43.020]  Where you can shoot the leader and take over. But unfortunately, folks, we are just another
[38:43.020 --> 38:49.100]  banana. So Jim, if bigger and meaner and you know, with better weaponry, Julian Assange
[38:49.100 --> 38:53.860]  even spoke to that recently. He talked about the catastrophic breakdown of law and order
[38:53.860 --> 38:58.820]  in the United States and he's right about that. But give us, give us this answer, Jim.
[38:58.820 --> 39:05.580]  If Nixon was forced to resign over the Watergate scandal, which was minuscule compared to what
[39:05.580 --> 39:12.700]  we're seeing today, what should, what should be done with Obama today if we are a country
[39:12.700 --> 39:14.940]  of law, what should happen to him?
[39:14.940 --> 39:21.940]  Well, several things should have happened long before now. Uh, number one, uh, I know
[39:21.940 --> 39:27.540]  everybody rolls their eyes and goes, Oh, this is just some politicking. But I think the
[39:27.540 --> 39:33.500]  evidence is certainly strong enough, uh, to point out that he is not even constitutionally
[39:33.500 --> 39:39.020]  qualified to be president, that there should have been at some point a legitimate hearing.
[39:39.020 --> 39:45.540]  The Supreme Court has never ruled on his eligibility. They simply refused to look at it. Uh, and
[39:45.540 --> 39:50.740]  uh, that, that's a starting point. Second thing would be, uh, grand juries. All right.
[39:50.740 --> 39:57.180]  And the main thing is, and the thing that I hope this could not, could lead to is, uh,
[39:57.180 --> 40:01.660]  impeachment proceedings. I mean, if we can impeach Bill Clinton because of a stain on
[40:01.660 --> 40:09.060]  the dress, surely we can impeach Obama over the loss of liberty, loss of sovereignty,
[40:09.060 --> 40:14.940]  murdering people around the world, uh, designating American citizens for assassination without
[40:14.940 --> 40:15.940]  trial.
[40:15.940 --> 40:21.980]  I know. I mean, Bill Clinton was only stalking one woman and Obama's stalking all women and
[40:21.980 --> 40:26.940]  men and everybody in the United States. Uh, Jim, are you up to take a few calls? Sure.
[40:26.940 --> 40:31.580]  All right. Let's go to our callers who've been waiting patiently. Marcus in Texas, Marcus
[40:31.580 --> 40:34.420]  you're on the air. Uh, direct your question please to Jim.
[40:34.420 --> 40:41.420]  Can you give me just a second? Take my phone off the speaker. Yeah. Yeah. Go for it, man.
[40:41.420 --> 40:46.260]  And while you're doing that, let me give out the web address of Jim Mars. It is jimmars.com.
[40:46.260 --> 40:51.940]  That's Mars with two R's. Okay. M a R R S jimmars.com. We'll get you information about
[40:51.940 --> 40:57.180]  Jim and his books and his research. Now, caller Marcus, go ahead, sir.
[40:57.180 --> 41:05.460]  Okay. I'm back. Jim, um, do you remember about 2000 years ago there was a man who was completely
[41:05.460 --> 41:13.820]  unselfish and gave himself just like Mr. Snowden? Oh, yes I do. In fact, there's been several
[41:13.820 --> 41:22.100]  people like that and, uh, uh, and isn't it interesting how that the people who advocate
[41:22.100 --> 41:29.260]  tyranny and control and propagate fear and loathing, they seem to prosper and do well.
[41:29.260 --> 41:33.220]  But the people like the fellow you're talking about, plus about a dozen others, I could
[41:33.220 --> 41:38.860]  name who, who say, let's all get along. Let's be peaceful. Let's love our fellow man. And
[41:38.860 --> 41:43.540]  they tend to get assassinated or strung up in one way or another. Don't they?
[41:43.540 --> 41:48.660]  Yeah. And why? Well, good, good question. Call it. But let me ask this too. Why do we
[41:48.660 --> 41:52.860]  now have apologists for all of this, Jim? We've got these, you know, predictably the
[41:52.860 --> 41:56.740]  liberals and the Democrats are out there running around on the mainstream media saying, oh,
[41:56.740 --> 42:00.820]  who cares that they're reading all our email and listening to all our phone calls. We can
[42:00.820 --> 42:07.580]  trust Obama. He's our savior. Yeah, it's insane. That's right. Well, all I can picture is a
[42:07.580 --> 42:15.500]  middle class German in the 1930s who said, well, I'm not doing anything wrong. I care
[42:15.500 --> 42:23.380]  if the government snoops on me and spies on me and, and launches wars all around the world,
[42:23.380 --> 42:31.380]  you know, because I am not guilty. I am merely following my orders. Exactly. Exactly. Smell
[42:31.380 --> 42:36.980]  the history. Well, now Rand Paul, we're going to play this video later. Rand Paul is now
[42:36.980 --> 42:42.940]  saying that he wants 10 million Americans to join in a class action lawsuit that he
[42:42.940 --> 42:47.980]  wants to take to the Supreme Court to challenge all of this. But let me ask you this, Jim,
[42:47.980 --> 42:52.900]  even if the Supreme Court ruled that this was illegal and unconstitutional, this NSA
[42:52.900 --> 42:57.620]  spy system isn't going to go down voluntarily. They may say, oh yeah, we agreed not to spy
[42:57.620 --> 43:01.500]  on Americans anymore. Yeah. Wink, wink, cross your fingers behind your back. I mean, come
[43:01.500 --> 43:05.980]  on, it's a joke. They're going to do whatever they want because they are a runaway criminal
[43:05.980 --> 43:11.180]  gang that recognizes no boundaries and no law. How do we ever stop this, Jim? Well,
[43:11.180 --> 43:17.500]  for one thing we can do, I'll tell you one little trick I've been doing just to thwart
[43:17.500 --> 43:22.740]  the system because as I said in the beginning, this is nothing new. It's new that somebody
[43:22.740 --> 43:29.260]  on the inside has come forward and says, yes, we're doing all this as opposed to the denials
[43:29.260 --> 43:34.980]  by both government and the communications companies. But what we know they've been doing
[43:34.980 --> 43:40.260]  for a long time with their supercomputers is recording everything that goes, the emails
[43:40.260 --> 43:45.580]  and telephone calls and everything else. And then it's run through a filter, see, and if
[43:45.580 --> 43:52.820]  you say something, certain words like Osama bin Laden or nuclear bomb or, or Iraq, Afghanistan,
[43:52.820 --> 43:57.580]  then it flags it and then people will start listening to find out what you're saying.
[43:57.580 --> 44:03.180]  So what we do is we overload the system. Every time you call up your mom, you say, hey mom,
[44:03.180 --> 44:10.980]  bin Laden sends a nuclear bomb to see if you've had any drones come over and you throw in
[44:10.980 --> 44:16.620]  every word you can think of before you start your conversation and then you can overload
[44:16.620 --> 44:19.700]  them. You know, that's actually a really good strategy. I'm glad you mentioned that. That's
[44:19.700 --> 44:24.660]  the noise strategy because if you think about it, this guy Snowden who came forward, he's
[44:24.660 --> 44:30.260]  just one of probably thousands of analysts who many of which are probably in their twenties
[44:30.260 --> 44:34.460]  who are sitting around at these desks, just analyzing and listening to people's phone
[44:34.460 --> 44:39.020]  calls that have been flagged by the system. So you're right. If you can seed all of these
[44:39.020 --> 44:43.140]  phone calls with these kinds of words and even in your emails and so on, then yeah,
[44:43.140 --> 44:46.900]  they're going to flag you, but they're going to waste all their time listening to nonsense.
[44:46.900 --> 44:51.900]  Exactly. And of course then there are those who say, well, you're going to harm our national
[44:51.900 --> 45:00.220]  security. Well, if you go back and actually look at the terrorist attacks that have been
[45:00.220 --> 45:05.380]  that we've had in this country, beginning with nine 11, uh, you're going to find that
[45:05.380 --> 45:15.460]  every one of them involves an CIA or FBI. In other words, it's all, uh, agents provocateur.
[45:15.460 --> 45:20.980]  They've all been created folks. Uh, they're the ones setting it up so they have an excuse
[45:20.980 --> 45:26.020]  to spy on us and then they can trick in the book. I mean, you go back to the right stack,
[45:26.020 --> 45:32.980]  they set fire to the Reichstag to their parliament building and then blamed it on communist terrorists
[45:32.980 --> 45:39.220]  and began to eradicate the communist party in Germany. It's the oldest trick in the book.
[45:39.220 --> 45:43.780]  And they always claim they need more power. They need to listen to more people. Jay Leno,
[45:43.780 --> 45:48.980]  here's his quote, quote, we wanted a president that listens to all Americans. Now we have
[45:48.980 --> 45:54.940]  one. Good for you, Jay. Let's take another caller. Ryan in Minnesota. Ryan, you're on
[45:54.940 --> 45:59.180]  the Alex Jones show with Jim Mars and Mike Adams. Go ahead, Ryan.
[45:59.180 --> 46:05.580]  Yes. Nice to see you today. Um, I'm happy to see that this information is finally made
[46:05.580 --> 46:10.820]  public. Uh, most of us in the know probably already assumed it was taking place, but the
[46:10.820 --> 46:17.100]  actual breadth and depth of the information that they have and can store is just, you
[46:17.100 --> 46:23.100]  know, crazy. Mind boggling. Yeah. I'm wondering what's next. You know, we're not on our computer
[46:23.100 --> 46:27.460]  or at home or have a cell phone on us. Are they going to make us wear some kind of microphone
[46:27.460 --> 46:33.580]  and camera? We don't want to be away from technology that could possibly track and record
[46:33.580 --> 46:39.100]  everything saying, well, check this out there. I saw a camera being announced. It's some
[46:39.100 --> 46:43.980]  kind of a camera that takes you, you clip it onto your shirt and it takes a photo of
[46:43.980 --> 46:48.740]  your entire life. It takes a photo every 60 seconds of everything you do all day long
[46:48.740 --> 46:55.140]  and then it uploads it to the cloud. I wouldn't doubt it. And it might be mandatory here in
[46:55.140 --> 47:00.300]  the future. Who knows? Good point. They might say, Oh, you don't, you don't get Obamacare.
[47:00.300 --> 47:03.380]  You don't get healthcare unless you wear all this surveillance equipment. Yeah. But go
[47:03.380 --> 47:07.860]  ahead with your question. Guys, because if you'll think about it, every time you pull
[47:07.860 --> 47:13.700]  up at a stoplight or walk up to a corner, there's cameras and I'm sure there's no big
[47:13.700 --> 47:18.040]  technical problem to put listening devices there too. Well, they've got them in the lamppost.
[47:18.040 --> 47:21.660]  Remember that story from, I don't know, a year ago or something here on info Wars, the,
[47:21.660 --> 47:25.900]  the, the street lights are actually fitted with microphones in some places to listen
[47:25.900 --> 47:31.420]  to you. Oh, but wait, that's a conspiracy theory. No, no one's listening to you. But
[47:31.420 --> 47:33.220]  go ahead with your question though. Caller.
[47:33.220 --> 47:40.100]  Uh, yeah, I'm just wondering how much more, how further could they possibly erode what
[47:40.100 --> 47:44.820]  we have left of the fourth amendment? How, I mean, what else can they, besides, you know,
[47:44.820 --> 47:50.540]  helping everybody when they drive down the road for no reason, they will take all you
[47:50.540 --> 47:56.380]  give them. All right. And we have been given, given, given it's time to say no more. And,
[47:56.380 --> 48:00.200]  and the answer to that too, Ryan, is that they'll, they'll have mind reading technology.
[48:00.200 --> 48:04.180]  They will literally read your mind and they'll, they'll put in pre-crime, you know, it's just,
[48:04.180 --> 48:09.420]  it's just like that movie. Uh, what was it called with Tom cruise minority report? Yeah.
[48:09.420 --> 48:13.460]  Uh, that movie could become a reality. That's where they want to go. They want to read your
[48:13.460 --> 48:16.820]  mind. But great call, Ryan. Uh, any further comments on that, Jim, before we go to the
[48:16.820 --> 48:17.820]  next call?
[48:17.820 --> 48:27.020]  Yeah. Quickly. Have you ever heard of a YottaBite? No. Okay. They are building, uh, they, the
[48:27.020 --> 48:36.620]  national security agency, uh, is in the process of completing a, um, a huge, uh, uh, compound
[48:36.620 --> 48:42.780]  to billion dollar compound in Utah. Uh, that is one third larger than the U S capital to
[48:42.780 --> 48:47.340]  store all forms of communication. So in other words, they're not only listening, they're
[48:47.340 --> 48:53.740]  storing it all the way and, uh, they're going up to a YottaBite. Okay. YottaBite. What's
[48:53.740 --> 48:59.380]  that? Well, you already know about gigabytes. That's the most commonly used unit for computer
[48:59.380 --> 49:06.020]  hard disk storage and a petabyte. That's a thousand petabytes equals an exabyte and a
[49:06.020 --> 49:12.180]  thousand exabytes equals a zettabyte and a thousand zettabytes equals a YottaBite. In
[49:12.180 --> 49:20.860]  other words, a YottaBite, uh, it holds, you know, one quadrillion gigabytes and the average
[49:20.860 --> 49:28.220]  household computer holds about 200 gigabytes. They are now putting in the capacity to not
[49:28.220 --> 49:33.700]  only listen, but to store, uh, all of the information on everybody. Well, yeah. What
[49:33.700 --> 49:36.860]  do you, and what do you think they're going to use those for? Are they, are they going
[49:36.860 --> 49:44.340]  to use this to help uplift humanity by selling it to commercial enterprises so they can pinpoint
[49:44.340 --> 49:51.900]  your marketing needs and pinpoint you for advertising. Uh, and then they'll figure out
[49:51.900 --> 49:58.540]  ways to use that for psychological warfare operations so that they can get you to believing
[49:58.540 --> 50:03.460]  and, uh, in just about anything they want you to believe in. It's incredibly, this,
[50:03.460 --> 50:10.020]  this is massive slavery. This is so far beyond 1984. This is Orwellian to the extreme. Let's
[50:10.020 --> 50:14.100]  go to another caller to get some more comments. Bill from Philadelphia. Bill, you're on the
[50:14.100 --> 50:20.500]  air with Jim Mars. Go ahead. Yeah. Hi Mike. Hi Jim. Um, I just wanted to make a comment
[50:20.500 --> 50:25.220]  and then you guys can add to it. What do you see fit? Uh, people in this country have to
[50:25.220 --> 50:30.500]  stop having the opinion that if I'm doing nothing wrong, then what does it matter? Well,
[50:30.500 --> 50:36.180]  it does matter because there's a dossier being created on every American in this country.
[50:36.180 --> 50:43.900]  What I have done to try to limit my exposure is a cash as much as possible. Unplug the
[50:43.900 --> 50:47.220]  cable. Hey Bill, stay with us. Will you stay on the line? We've got to go to break, but

[53:40.700 --> 53:44.360]  when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties
[53:44.360 --> 53:47.940]  of the people than a standing army? Hi, Ted Anderson. I'm placing a free silver dollar

[54:13.380 --> 54:25.260]  in to NPR. Welcome to your relaxation moment with visual imagery of your Lord and savior,
[54:25.260 --> 54:30.660]  Obama. Who's listening to your phone call? You know that music doesn't match. We got
[54:30.660 --> 54:38.620]  to line it up better. Wouldn't you like a relaxing, joyful, frolicking in the clouds.
[54:38.620 --> 54:46.940]  Welcome to NPR, where you'll never hear real news, just stuff to make you relax and enjoy
[54:46.940 --> 54:53.540]  your slave cage. All right. Sorry, I'm goofing around a little bit. Had a little bit too
[54:53.540 --> 54:58.080]  much chocolate today. Jim Mars continues with us. This is the Alex Jones Show. No, this
[54:58.080 --> 55:05.200]  is not NPR. You're tuning in to the Truth Radio, actually the alternative media, which
[55:05.200 --> 55:09.140]  is now the new mainstream media, since the alternative media likes to pretend none of
[55:09.140 --> 55:14.720]  this exists. They told Alex years ago that he was crazy to say the NSA was listening
[55:14.720 --> 55:19.780]  to your phone calls and reading your emails. Turns out he was right all along, once again.
[55:19.780 --> 55:24.700]  And another person who was right is, of course, Jim Mars, who continues with us as a guest
[55:24.700 --> 55:29.660]  in this segment. Jim, continuing with this story, what do you think is going to happen
[55:29.660 --> 55:35.340]  to the whistleblower, Ed Snowden? Does he die within weeks or days? What happens?
[55:35.340 --> 55:41.660]  No, they're a little smarter than that. If he should suddenly get run over tomorrow,
[55:41.660 --> 55:46.740]  I think everybody in the whole world would go, aha. So that's not going to help their
[55:46.740 --> 55:53.460]  cause any. No, they'll come out with some expert or some psychiatrist, some psychologist,
[55:53.460 --> 55:59.060]  and they'll all start giving that psycho babble and try to say, well, he's just delusional
[55:59.060 --> 56:02.620]  and he doesn't know what he's talking about. But the problem is he does know what he's
[56:02.620 --> 56:09.140]  talking about. And as I said before, in fact, as we said at the beginning of the show, he's
[56:09.140 --> 56:14.340]  basically only telling us what we already knew to be true. But you actually kind of
[56:14.340 --> 56:19.980]  stole some of my thunder there because the big point I was going to make is that everyone
[56:19.980 --> 56:26.820]  who's been pointed to and called a conspiracy theorist, and that's yourself, Mike Adams,
[56:26.820 --> 56:36.820]  Alex Jones, that's myself, and a lot of others, turns out, gee, we're right. In fact, that's
[56:36.820 --> 56:41.780]  the only thing that keeps my sanity because sometimes I try to catch myself up and go,
[56:41.780 --> 56:45.900]  hey, Mars, maybe you're just making stuff up. Maybe you're just looking at things the
[56:45.900 --> 56:51.460]  wrong way. Maybe you are just a conspiracy theorist. So I get real objective and I sit
[56:51.460 --> 56:55.260]  back and I'll look at all of the evidence and all of the facts and all the information
[56:55.260 --> 57:02.580]  I have, and I go, no. It's all true. The same thing I'm sure that you've done, Mike. Yeah,
[57:02.580 --> 57:07.940]  in fact, we have a caller on this very point, Gary from New Mexico. Gary, welcome to the
[57:07.940 --> 57:13.340]  show. You have comments about Alex mentioning all this years ago, I understand? Actually,
[57:13.340 --> 57:23.140]  yes, Jim and Mike. You guys have in your archives a video from Bill Benny. The article was Adon
[57:23.140 --> 57:31.860]  Salazar, August 28, 2012, and when I called in, I mentioned that Bill Benny knows if he
[57:31.860 --> 57:40.740]  can connect the dots to Operation Thin Thread, Trailblazer, and now what he came out with,
[57:40.740 --> 57:50.940]  Alex... Oh, wait. In Stellar Wind, and Jim said it exactly. You can connect the dots
[57:50.940 --> 57:58.100]  to Stellar Wind to the data center in Utah. Well, yeah, all the puzzle pieces are all
[57:58.100 --> 58:02.460]  coming together now. We see what's happening, culture of intimidation with the IRS, the
[58:02.460 --> 58:07.420]  Department of Justice surveilling journalists, and now all this comes out with the NSA. Jim,
[58:07.420 --> 58:11.580]  we've only got about 30 seconds in this segment. Your comments? Yeah, well, there's no justice
[58:11.580 --> 58:17.060]  in the Justice Department and there's no intelligence in the intelligence community. It's time for
[58:17.060 --> 58:22.020]  the people to start taking the power back to themselves and try to turn the United States
[58:22.020 --> 58:28.060]  of America back into a freedom-loving republic. Well said, Jim, and we're going to go to break
[58:28.060 --> 58:31.740]  here shortly, but we're going to continue on the other side of that with five more minutes
[58:31.740 --> 58:38.780]  of Jim Mars and his comments on the breaking NSA scandal, and we'll be right back. Stay
[58:38.780 --> 58:52.740]  with us. This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network. There is an increased need
[58:52.740 --> 58:58.660]  to support our immunity and health. At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs

[59:53.500 --> 01:00:05.340]  Reaching war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:12.380]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:25.500]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:31.360]  Well the NSA spy grid scandal has exploded onto the global scene. Now people are realizing
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:36.940]  their government has been lying to them and spying on them in ways they never could have
[01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:42.580]  imagined before. It's so devastating to the credibility of the government that now it
[01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:48.980]  has a lot of people asking, is it time for a citizen's revolt against this big brother
[01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:54.360]  expansion of government power? And continuing in our last segment with author Jim Mars of
[01:00:54.360 --> 01:01:01.680]  jimmars.com, that's two Rs on the Mars, or two Rs on Mars. Jim is going to give us some
[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:06.420]  more information on why this matters. So Jim, we were just talking about what you think
[01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:11.260]  might happen to Snowden. Apparently, we're being told that he is now missing in Hong
[01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:17.140]  Kong and faces the fear of extradition there. Might be trying to sneak his way over to Iceland.
[01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:22.340]  That's a long haul though, isn't it? Yeah, it's a long haul. Besides that, hey,
[01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:27.700]  we are indeed in the global village today. You can't get away from it. He went to Hong
[01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:33.980]  Kong because Hong Kong, although now part of China, does have a certain amount of autonomy.
[01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:38.580]  Of course, I remember visiting in Tibet and they were told there they had some autonomy
[01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:43.660]  and then as soon as they tried to exercise their autonomy, the Chinese swooped down and
[01:01:43.660 --> 01:01:51.660]  killed a bunch of them. But here's the thing. There is no more real nations, okay? Because
[01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:58.740]  at the very top of the power pyramid in China even, you find the very same people. I mean,
[01:01:58.740 --> 01:02:03.460]  they practically own the United States. They were just recently given entree to the Federal
[01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:09.060]  Reserves. Our reserves, they have drawing rights like everybody else. They're members
[01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:17.540]  of the G20 that's all being administered through the old bank of international settlements,
[01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:22.260]  the World Bank. And at the very top, it's the same people controlling both. But this
[01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:27.380]  gives us an opportunity because they want to continue to keep the faÃ§ade going that
[01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:33.060]  somehow we're enemies with China. See, so in China, they can report pretty openly about
[01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:38.240]  all the corruption and the bad stuff going on in America. While in America, we can report
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:42.940]  on the bad stuff going on in China. But in either country, you can't report on what's
[01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:47.380]  happening in that country because they have control over the media. What you do is you
[01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:51.660]  start listening to the Chinese sources to find out what's happening here. And the Chinese
[01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:56.980]  need to start listening to US media to find out what's happening over there. It's an oddball
[01:02:56.980 --> 01:03:02.300]  thing but I think you'll agree with me that at the top, the leadership is the same.
[01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:06.660]  Absolutely. They're all interested in total domination over the people. And if you look
[01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:12.340]  at what Snowden gave as his justification for why he stepped forward, he was saying
[01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:16.580]  that he did not want to live in a country where this kind of surveillance is happening
[01:03:16.580 --> 01:03:24.520]  on a routine basis. He actually had some morals and some ethics. He was a Ron Paul supporter.
[01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:29.020]  He saw what was going on and he decided to step forward even knowing because he worked
[01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:32.380]  for the CIA, knowing that they would try to kill him.
[01:03:32.380 --> 01:03:39.020]  Yeah. You mentioned Ron Paul. I am probably one of the few people who have actually and
[01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:45.020]  legally voted for Ron Paul for President of the United States. That was in 1988 when he
[01:03:45.020 --> 01:03:51.940]  ran as the candidate for the Libertarian Party. And all I got to do is say this, going all
[01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:57.180]  the way back into the 80s, Ron Paul was the only man who's shown any backbone, who spoke
[01:03:57.180 --> 01:04:02.700]  truth, who spoke to truth, who tried to tell us what's going on and tried to tell us here's
[01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:08.940]  what you could do about it. And he's always ended up being, you know, tail last and oh,
[01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:15.060]  just forget him and never mind about him and blah, blah, blah. Why do we continue to fall
[01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:21.340]  for the media hype of the worst people in the whole world? And when we finally get somebody
[01:04:21.340 --> 01:04:28.660]  that's got some sense and actually probably has the best interest of everyone at heart.
[01:04:28.660 --> 01:04:33.980]  And of course, he's not very dynamic because he looks like and acts like just kind of an
[01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:40.340]  old country doctor. Well, you, but of course, wait a minute. He is just the very type of
[01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:45.460]  people, person that we need. We got to let you go. We're out of time on this segment,
[01:04:45.460 --> 01:04:49.700]  but great insights. And everybody, I want to encourage you to check out Jim Mars's website
[01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:54.020]  and also his book, our occulted history. Thank you, Jim, for joining us on the Alex Jones

[01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:50.140]  Alex and his staff have used these earth friendly pure soaps for years.
[01:07:50.140 --> 01:08:05.420]  See them on the web, www.5starsoap.com or call 1-800-340-7091 for a catalog.
[01:08:05.420 --> 01:08:10.260]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:08:10.260 --> 01:08:11.900]  You want answers?
[01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:13.420]  Well so does he.
[01:08:13.420 --> 01:08:22.740]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:31.180]  All right, welcome to the second hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:31.180 --> 01:08:33.900]  This is Mike Adams, the Health Ranger filling in for Alex.
[01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:38.780]  He'll be back on the show tomorrow with a lot to say about this explosive scandal, the
[01:08:38.780 --> 01:08:41.860]  NSA spy grid scandal.
[01:08:41.860 --> 01:08:48.700]  Now the whistleblower Ed Snowden has stepped forward at great risk to his own life and
[01:08:48.700 --> 01:08:51.380]  also potentially the lives of his family members.
[01:08:51.380 --> 01:08:56.020]  Who knows what these spooks are going to do because of this, but he has stepped forward
[01:08:56.020 --> 01:08:58.180]  of course in this groundbreaking interview.
[01:08:58.180 --> 01:09:03.780]  It's probably the biggest story of the century in terms of government surveillance.
[01:09:03.780 --> 01:09:08.860]  It's so much bigger than anything else, even Watergate or anything even approaching that.
[01:09:08.860 --> 01:09:13.940]  Glenn Greenwald, the journalist from The Guardian, this is the biggest story of his life, absolutely.
[01:09:13.940 --> 01:09:14.940]  No question about it.
[01:09:14.940 --> 01:09:19.460]  Now we're going to play in just a second, we're going to play another segment from that
[01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:25.580]  interview, but first I want to tell you that one of these leaked slides of the PRISM data
[01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:31.100]  collection system that Snowden leaked to The Guardian shows the actual dates at which these
[01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:35.540]  services were activated with connections to the government.
[01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:41.700]  So the government has direct server access to Microsoft and Hotmail, Yahoo Mail, Google
[01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:47.900]  and Gmail, and Google Drive also if you store your files in the cloud, Facebook, PalTalk,
[01:09:47.900 --> 01:09:51.140]  YouTube, Skype, AOL, and Apple.
[01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:55.440]  All of these are now sharing data with the federal government, sharing all of your data,
[01:09:55.440 --> 01:10:01.380]  your logins, your passwords, your emails, your text chats, your voice chats, your photos,
[01:10:01.380 --> 01:10:05.980]  your posts, social media posts, everything that you've been doing lately that you post
[01:10:05.980 --> 01:10:08.500]  online, they know about it.
[01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:11.820]  They're even scanning your files if you use Google Drive.
[01:10:11.820 --> 01:10:17.420]  We have got to get to a point now across the board where we all stop using these companies'
[01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:20.880]  products and services, period.
[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:25.200]  It's difficult, it's difficult, I mean we still use them on our website, but we've got
[01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:26.420]  to find alternatives.
[01:10:26.420 --> 01:10:33.220]  Now we dropped Facebook comments from our website just about, what was it, 10 days ago,
[01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:34.220]  maybe only a week ago.
[01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:37.740]  We dropped them because we were fed up with Facebook censorship.
[01:10:37.740 --> 01:10:39.820]  We said enough is enough, we dropped them.
[01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:45.740]  We replaced it with Discuss, a different comment engine, and what do you know, the IQ of the
[01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:48.700]  commenters went straight up.
[01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:51.800]  All of a sudden the comments were more intelligent.
[01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:56.100]  But we've all got to find ways to do this, and as a caller mentioned in the last hour,
[01:10:56.100 --> 01:11:04.980]  there is a huge business opportunity here for people who can create truly secure, non-betraying
[01:11:04.980 --> 01:11:07.460]  services that are chats and emails.
[01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:13.020]  I mean, there's Startpage email, I think it's called Startmail, but it's, you know, you
[01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:17.060]  got to pay 50 bucks a year I think is what it costs, but at least you get your privacy.
[01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:20.700]  50 bucks is a small price to pay to get your privacy.
[01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:28.260]  Now before we go to this interview, continuing the interview with Snowden by Glenn Greenwald,
[01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:33.940]  let me just encourage you that this broadcast is reader, or listener supported, sorry, I
[01:11:33.940 --> 01:11:38.600]  used to say reader supported because that's my website, listener supported.
[01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:42.460]  Please check this out, the ProPure water filters really are good.
[01:11:42.460 --> 01:11:46.500]  I know I've assessed all the water filters myself, I even taught a class on how to build
[01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:50.820]  your own water filter, and the ProPure is better than anything you can build yourself.
[01:11:50.820 --> 01:11:54.580]  I mean, I've taught Preparedness, I've done things like that, ProPure is really the best
[01:11:54.580 --> 01:12:01.080]  out there, so go to infowarsstore.com, get 10% off the filter right now with promo code
[01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:07.180]  WATER, just WATER, and get a ProPure water filter, it's gravity fed, and it has an all-in-one
[01:12:07.180 --> 01:12:11.700]  filter that takes out fluoride from your water as well, so you can stay healthy at the same
[01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:16.700]  time that you're helping to support this broadcast and shoring up your emergency preparedness.
[01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:17.700]  So thank you for your support.
[01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:23.660]  Now let's continue with that interview with Snowden and see what he has to say about how
[01:12:23.660 --> 01:12:28.920]  anyone can be flagged as guilty under this system, go ahead.
[01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:32.500]  Because even if you're not doing anything wrong, you're being watched and recorded,
[01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:39.140]  and the storage capability of these systems increases every year consistently by orders
[01:12:39.140 --> 01:12:44.220]  of magnitude, to where it's getting to the point you don't have to have done anything
[01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:49.540]  wrong, you simply have to eventually fall under suspicion from somebody, even by a wrong
[01:12:49.540 --> 01:12:54.780]  call, and then they can use this system to go back in time and scrutinize every decision
[01:12:54.780 --> 01:13:00.620]  you've ever made, every friend you've ever discussed something with, and attack you on
[01:13:00.620 --> 01:13:07.640]  that basis to sort of derive suspicion from an innocent life and paint anyone in the context
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:10.220]  of a wrongdoer.
[01:13:10.220 --> 01:13:15.460]  There's a comment, they can paint anyone in the context of a wrongdoer, you can go ahead
[01:13:15.460 --> 01:13:20.600]  and cut that video, think about that, because they spy on you and everyone, they can go
[01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:25.120]  back in time and they can scrutinize every decision you ever made, every conversation
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:30.700]  you ever had, things that you may have not even thought of, I mean, in the future, if
[01:13:30.700 --> 01:13:35.500]  they catch you speeding down the road, they can use this system to go back and catch you
[01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:39.980]  on a phone call talking about how much you love to drive fast, and then, you know, worsen
[01:13:39.980 --> 01:13:43.980]  your speeding ticket, that's obviously a very silly, light example, they could use this
[01:13:43.980 --> 01:13:48.540]  to do many, many other things to threaten and intimidate you, shut down your speech
[01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:54.020]  or influence key people in key positions of power to change their decisions, like members
[01:13:54.020 --> 01:13:55.020]  of Congress.
[01:13:55.020 --> 01:14:00.100]  And by the way, quick correction, I just mentioned in the last segment that we dropped Facebook
[01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:05.540]  as our discussion engine, and when I say we, I mean Natural News, that's my website.
[01:14:05.540 --> 01:14:10.060]  I did not mean to imply Infowars, I don't have any control over the Infowars discussion
[01:14:10.060 --> 01:14:14.780]  engines, I'm not even sure what Infowars is using for their engine, but when I say we,
[01:14:14.780 --> 01:14:20.100]  I meant Natural News, it's kind of playing, you know, dual roles here when I come in and
[01:14:20.100 --> 01:14:25.340]  host for Alex Jones, obviously, I'm speaking on behalf of Infowars, or at least as a guest
[01:14:25.340 --> 01:14:29.700]  host for Infowars, but sometimes, I sort of revert back to the we, meaning Natural
[01:14:29.700 --> 01:14:30.700]  News.
[01:14:30.700 --> 01:14:33.900]  In any case, the bottom line is we all got to get away from these services because we
[01:14:33.900 --> 01:14:37.740]  know they're sharing all of this information with the government, so I know, because I've
[01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:42.480]  had conversations with Alex privately, I know that Alex is also concerned and looking for
[01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:49.020]  ways to eliminate any kind of connection with any of these services, you know, not even
[01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:54.040]  to use their services, but he's also right when he says that as long as Facebook has
[01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:59.540]  an audience, we got to use the enemy's tools to spread the truth, so I'm sure that Infowars
[01:14:59.540 --> 01:15:05.980]  and Natural News will both continue to post on Facebook, but we encourage people to stop
[01:15:05.980 --> 01:15:10.400]  posting your personal details on there, you know, we can post news on there, that's not
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:14.380]  a problem, but if you go on there and post, you know, who's your friend and what you did
[01:15:14.380 --> 01:15:18.240]  last weekend and here's pictures of your family, that's the kind of information they can use
[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:24.300]  against you, so don't use these services for anything that can ever be used against you.
[01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:28.740]  Now, here's some additional breaking news, and by the way, we've got John Rappaport coming
[01:15:28.740 --> 01:15:32.500]  up at the bottom of this hour for his analysis of what's going on and we're going to continue
[01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:37.140]  with your calls, so stay on the line there, Jack and Frances and Linda and others, stay
[01:15:37.140 --> 01:15:40.620]  on the line, we'll get to you in just a minute here, we've still got time.
[01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:44.460]  Iceland is considering offering NSA whistleblower asylum.
[01:15:44.460 --> 01:15:51.940]  So this is a quote from Birgitta Jonsdottir, sorry, I butcher these Nordic names, they're
[01:15:51.940 --> 01:15:56.220]  difficult, but she is the executive director of the International Modern Media Institute
[01:15:56.220 --> 01:16:03.940]  and in this article posted on Infowars right now by Kurt Nemo, she states that she essentially
[01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:11.060]  welcomes Snowden to seek asylum in Iceland and Snowden has said, the only thing I can
[01:16:11.060 --> 01:16:14.780]  do is sit here and hope the Hong Kong government does not deport me.
[01:16:14.780 --> 01:16:19.740]  Well, there can be a lot of pressure brought to bear on the Hong Kong government, believe
[01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:24.560]  me, even if necessary, death threats from, you know, the right spooks.
[01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:30.440]  So Snowden is in danger, he has now apparently quote disappeared off the radar in Hong Kong,
[01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:36.820]  no one can find him, he checked out of the hotel, he's on the run, because he knows he's
[01:16:36.820 --> 01:16:42.860]  going to have to, otherwise he's going to be probably killed or tortured and in any
[01:16:42.860 --> 01:16:46.700]  case they're definitely going to try to assassinate his reputation and character.
[01:16:46.700 --> 01:16:54.020]  So watch out for retroactive false flags where they plant evidence into his past, see, this
[01:16:54.020 --> 01:16:55.920]  is the kind of thing that the NSA can do.
[01:16:55.920 --> 01:17:03.060]  They can fabricate some fictional history and they can put it into his record, into
[01:17:03.060 --> 01:17:08.460]  his past and then they can bring that out and say, ah, see, he was, you know, caught
[01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:15.300]  smoking crack or whatever back in, you know, 19 or 2005, they can make up anything.
[01:17:15.300 --> 01:17:19.260]  At this point, you can't believe anything the NSA is saying, okay, you can't believe
[01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:24.540]  anything the government is telling you, certainly not Obama who covered all this up, certainly
[01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:30.440]  not the NSA who's in the business of deception, I mean, this whole thing was a grand deception.
[01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:34.180]  You can't believe anything that they're telling you from this point forward.
[01:17:34.180 --> 01:17:39.980]  So let's hope that Snowden gets asylum in Iceland or some other country, maybe, hey,
[01:17:39.980 --> 01:17:45.220]  maybe Ecuador, huh, they'll have Julian Assange and Snowden.
[01:17:45.220 --> 01:17:49.460]  Ecuador could start to put together quite a little roster of some whistleblowers right
[01:17:49.460 --> 01:17:50.460]  there.
[01:17:50.460 --> 01:17:52.900]  They could be a force to be reckoned with.
[01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:53.900]  Go Correa.
[01:17:53.900 --> 01:17:54.900]  Yeah, great.
[01:17:54.900 --> 01:17:56.460]  This guy is silent.
[01:17:56.460 --> 01:18:00.260]  But let's continue with the calls with Jack in Florida.
[01:18:00.260 --> 01:18:01.580]  Jack, you're on the air.
[01:18:01.580 --> 01:18:03.940]  Go ahead with your questions or comments.
[01:18:03.940 --> 01:18:06.540]  You there, Jack?
[01:18:06.540 --> 01:18:08.020]  Yeah, here.
[01:18:08.020 --> 01:18:10.140]  Hey, Mike, how you doing?
[01:18:10.140 --> 01:18:11.140]  All right, doing good.
[01:18:11.140 --> 01:18:12.140]  Thanks for your call.
[01:18:12.140 --> 01:18:16.020]  You're doing a fantastic job every time you host a show, man, greatly appreciate it.
[01:18:16.020 --> 01:18:17.020]  Thank you.
[01:18:17.020 --> 01:18:18.020]  I'm doing my best.
[01:18:18.020 --> 01:18:19.020]  What's on your mind?
[01:18:19.020 --> 01:18:23.700]  I wanted to talk about the NSA whistleblowing stuff, obviously, the news, a couple of comments
[01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:25.100]  and a question for you.
[01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:27.820]  Go for it, yeah, go for it.
[01:18:27.820 --> 01:18:32.100]  Well, Thursday woke up, life changed forever, obviously, for everybody.
[01:18:32.100 --> 01:18:36.180]  The news that this has been going on, we were all kooks all this time and we were all right.
[01:18:36.180 --> 01:18:38.260]  So it was out, it's been going on forever.
[01:18:38.260 --> 01:18:39.260]  Yeah.
[01:18:39.260 --> 01:18:42.220]  They're listening to everything that we do, they're listening to everything that we do.
[01:18:42.220 --> 01:18:46.260]  And I think the implications of this had absolutely nothing to do with foreign terrorism whatsoever.
[01:18:46.260 --> 01:18:48.140]  I think this is completely domestic.
[01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:49.500]  Would you agree with that?
[01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:54.380]  Well, my guess is it's probably started out with foreign terrorists, maybe back right
[01:18:54.380 --> 01:18:58.220]  after it got signed into law, but then it quickly shifted to focus on domestic.
[01:18:58.220 --> 01:18:59.220]  So now I think you're right.
[01:18:59.220 --> 01:19:01.300]  I think it's almost entirely domestic focus.
[01:19:01.300 --> 01:19:03.740]  Yeah, and look at the implications of this.
[01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:04.740]  Look at the election.
[01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:07.500]  I mean, did this guy really win the election at this point?
[01:19:07.500 --> 01:19:08.500]  Yeah.
[01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:09.500]  I don't know.
[01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:11.820]  But you know, everything that's going on, they're probably blackmailing people left
[01:19:11.820 --> 01:19:12.820]  and right.
[01:19:12.820 --> 01:19:13.820]  Oh, of course.
[01:19:13.820 --> 01:19:17.460]  They probably blackmailed the Chief Justice on the whole Obamacare ruling, which is why
[01:19:17.460 --> 01:19:19.420]  he won 80 at the last minute.
[01:19:19.420 --> 01:19:20.420]  Wow.
[01:19:20.420 --> 01:19:21.420]  That's a really good point.
[01:19:21.420 --> 01:19:22.420]  What if they got all his emails?
[01:19:22.420 --> 01:19:23.420]  Yeah.
[01:19:23.420 --> 01:19:24.420]  They control everything.
[01:19:24.420 --> 01:19:25.420]  Exactly.
[01:19:25.420 --> 01:19:29.420]  This is total awareness of everything that's going on in our country 24 seven.
[01:19:29.420 --> 01:19:35.140]  So now I would even state that they could probably predict the future with this stuff.
[01:19:35.140 --> 01:19:39.140]  Oh, well, we already know Google has those algorithms to predict the future behavior
[01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:42.820]  of individuals based on their search behavior and their emails and things like that.
[01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:44.020]  That's not even science fiction.
[01:19:44.020 --> 01:19:45.640]  That's already here.
[01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:48.300]  But caller, you're tracking me there.
[01:19:48.300 --> 01:19:49.860]  They're poisoning the water.
[01:19:49.860 --> 01:19:50.920]  We got to go to break.
[01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:51.920]  But stay with us.
[01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:53.420]  I want to go back to you after this break.
[01:19:53.420 --> 01:19:54.420]  So stay with us.

[01:22:20.740 --> 01:22:21.740]  in need.
[01:22:21.740 --> 01:22:25.600]  Please keep Oklahoma important, but we've got serious food issues.
[01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:31.740]  For example, the rising cost of food, especially beef, last year's worst drought in 50 years
[01:22:31.740 --> 01:22:36.340]  and the mandated ethanol production has dried up the feed supply for livestock.
[01:22:36.340 --> 01:22:40.980]  Chinese are offering $4.7 billion to buy our largest pork producer.

[01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:37.540]  counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes
[01:23:37.540 --> 01:23:38.540]  to service debt.
[01:23:38.540 --> 01:23:42.060]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public
[01:23:42.060 --> 01:23:45.380]  currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:23:45.380 --> 01:23:49.020]  Hi, Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary
[01:23:49.020 --> 01:23:50.020]  system.
[01:23:50.020 --> 01:23:51.020]  Call for your copy.
[01:23:51.020 --> 01:23:52.020]  800-686-2237.
[01:23:52.020 --> 01:23:54.300]  It's time to understand the system.
[01:23:54.300 --> 01:23:56.660]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:23:56.660 --> 01:23:57.660]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:23:57.660 --> 01:24:10.620]  All right, we're going to continue with our caller here in just a second, Jack in Florida.
[01:24:10.620 --> 01:24:12.220]  Thanks for staying on the line.
[01:24:12.220 --> 01:24:16.580]  I was just joking with the guys, the producers here between segments.
[01:24:16.580 --> 01:24:22.500]  So, you know, the problem with the NSA is that the people there are really smart.
[01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:26.700]  I mean, this guy Snowden, he's obviously a very high IQ individual that grabbed him right
[01:24:26.700 --> 01:24:27.700]  out of high school.
[01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:28.900]  He never even finished high school.
[01:24:28.900 --> 01:24:34.220]  He went straight from, I don't know, you know, being a sophomore in high school to working
[01:24:34.220 --> 01:24:40.140]  for the CIA, probably doing some kind of crazy computer decryption algorithms or something.
[01:24:40.140 --> 01:24:42.420]  The problem is that the people there are just too smart.
[01:24:42.420 --> 01:24:49.420]  What we need is to put the TSA in charge of the NSA so that they're not very capable.
[01:24:49.420 --> 01:24:53.900]  You know, you'd go into the NSA analyst room and all the agents would be putting on latex
[01:24:53.900 --> 01:24:59.060]  gloves and saying, well, we don't want to catch something from people's email.
[01:24:59.060 --> 01:25:04.020]  Instead of surveilling your phone calls, you'd find they're all just surfing child porn sites
[01:25:04.020 --> 01:25:06.860]  because they are pedophiles after all this.
[01:25:06.860 --> 01:25:09.780]  So I think that's our answer, Obama.
[01:25:09.780 --> 01:25:14.020]  We should just take all the TSA agents and just let them run the NSA.
[01:25:14.020 --> 01:25:19.100]  And then we'd all be safe because they're not going to get anything done that's useful.
[01:25:19.100 --> 01:25:22.740]  And by the way, Obama, if you were really smart, you know what you would do?
[01:25:22.740 --> 01:25:28.520]  You would give this guy Snowden, give him the highest citizens award in the history
[01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:32.480]  of America that would separate you from the scandal.
[01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:38.140]  And it would ensure the safety of this guy who is, after all, protecting Americans from
[01:25:38.140 --> 01:25:39.520]  bad government.
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:44.980]  So Obama does have a strategy to protect himself from the scandal and maybe avoid impeachment.
[01:25:44.980 --> 01:25:48.420]  But let's go back to our caller, Jack in Florida, you had some good points there.
[01:25:48.420 --> 01:25:50.660]  What are your thoughts continuing with this?
[01:25:50.660 --> 01:25:52.940]  Where do you think this is all going?
[01:25:52.940 --> 01:25:56.980]  I also think that just to build on what I was talking about before with Justice Roberts,
[01:25:56.980 --> 01:25:58.620]  they probably did this to betray us too.
[01:25:58.620 --> 01:26:03.300]  I think it came out that all this was leaked through emails and the whole Benghazi thing.
[01:26:03.300 --> 01:26:06.900]  They're using this as complete control to just blackmail anybody who opposes what they
[01:26:06.900 --> 01:26:10.060]  want because they've got all your information and everything about you now.
[01:26:10.060 --> 01:26:11.060]  You know, you're exactly right.
[01:26:11.060 --> 01:26:16.300]  I think we have to go back now and re-examine these key decisions and these key setups and
[01:26:16.300 --> 01:26:20.020]  scandals with this now in light.
[01:26:20.020 --> 01:26:21.020]  Because you're right.
[01:26:21.020 --> 01:26:22.020]  Go ahead.
[01:26:22.020 --> 01:26:24.460]  And like I was saying, they're poisoning the water, they're poisoning the food, they're
[01:26:24.460 --> 01:26:26.060]  spraying the skies.
[01:26:26.060 --> 01:26:28.540]  And these people expect me to disarm?
[01:26:28.540 --> 01:26:30.020]  I mean, this is laughable.
[01:26:30.020 --> 01:26:31.740]  Are you kidding me?
[01:26:31.740 --> 01:26:34.100]  You're obviously coming out to the American public.
[01:26:34.100 --> 01:26:41.100]  100 plus million gun owning Americans are the only thing standing in the way of these
[01:26:41.100 --> 01:26:42.380]  people taking over the world.
[01:26:42.380 --> 01:26:45.140]  They've already disarmed the whole western world.
[01:26:45.140 --> 01:26:46.140]  Everybody's already disarmed.
[01:26:46.140 --> 01:26:50.060]  This is why you see the gun grab going on right now.
[01:26:50.060 --> 01:26:53.020]  I think they knew that this was going to come out.
[01:26:53.020 --> 01:26:56.620]  I think you're being unreasonable.
[01:26:56.620 --> 01:26:59.700]  We can trust them with a national gun registration list.
[01:26:59.700 --> 01:27:01.260]  I know we can't trust the IRS.
[01:27:01.260 --> 01:27:02.520]  We can't trust the DOJ.
[01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:04.660]  We can't trust the FDA.
[01:27:04.660 --> 01:27:07.960]  We can't trust the ATF, the DEA, the NSA.
[01:27:07.960 --> 01:27:09.440]  We can't trust them.
[01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:10.440]  They're going to abuse the list.
[01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:15.960]  But I think a nationwide gun registration list, oh yeah, they would keep their promise
[01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:16.960]  on that one.
[01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:17.960]  Yeah.
[01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:18.960]  How could you think otherwise?
[01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:22.980]  It's scary to think that they're listening and reporting to this phone call we're having
[01:27:22.980 --> 01:27:23.980]  right now, Mike.
[01:27:23.980 --> 01:27:26.100]  Oh, you can bet they're listening to this broadcast.
[01:27:26.100 --> 01:27:27.100]  Absolutely.
[01:27:27.100 --> 01:27:29.100]  I'll put all the proper keywords, right?
[01:27:29.100 --> 01:27:32.240]  And I'm going to start doing what Jim Maher said.
[01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:36.220]  Every time I make a phone call or send an email from now on, it's just going to be nothing
[01:27:36.220 --> 01:27:37.220]  but few words.
[01:27:37.220 --> 01:27:42.220]  No, you're just making it into a song like, bomb-a-da-bomb-a-bomb-a-bomb-bomb-a-bim-la-da-bom-a-bim-a-dim-la-da.
[01:27:42.220 --> 01:27:44.440]  You just go at it, man.
[01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:47.520]  You just drop them all in there, let their computers go haywire.
[01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:50.620]  The NSA data center in Utah blows a fuse.
[01:27:50.620 --> 01:27:52.860]  Yeah, victory at last.
[01:27:52.860 --> 01:27:56.980]  And I think they're going to use a data center they're building out in Utah to link this
[01:27:56.980 --> 01:28:02.740]  whole system up to all of the cameras that they're putting at every intersection, too.
[01:28:02.740 --> 01:28:04.500]  Probably pretty soon they're going to have a matrix.
[01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:11.280]  They're going to plug that data center into your spinal column, just like out of the matrix.
[01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:12.900]  We are living in it right now.
[01:28:12.900 --> 01:28:14.140]  It is already here.
[01:28:14.140 --> 01:28:16.060]  It is here, yeah.
[01:28:16.060 --> 01:28:17.060]  Very good.
[01:28:17.060 --> 01:28:18.060]  I really love your call.
[01:28:18.060 --> 01:28:19.060]  Great points, Jack.
[01:28:19.060 --> 01:28:20.060]  Thank you for your call.
[01:28:20.060 --> 01:28:21.060]  Awesome.
[01:28:21.060 --> 01:28:22.060]  Mike, thanks for taking my call, man.
[01:28:22.060 --> 01:28:23.060]  Appreciate it.
[01:28:23.060 --> 01:28:24.060]  You bet.
[01:28:24.060 --> 01:28:25.060]  Great to have you on.
[01:28:25.060 --> 01:28:26.060]  Great calls all day.
[01:28:26.060 --> 01:28:28.020]  In fact, let's take another call right now.
[01:28:28.020 --> 01:28:31.620]  Simeon in England, or Simon, sorry, in England.
[01:28:31.620 --> 01:28:32.620]  Sorry I butchered your name there, sir.
[01:28:32.620 --> 01:28:33.620]  But you're on the air.
[01:28:33.620 --> 01:28:34.620]  Go ahead.
[01:28:34.620 --> 01:28:35.620]  Hi there.
[01:28:35.620 --> 01:28:36.620]  It's Simeon from England.
[01:28:36.620 --> 01:28:37.620]  Simeon.
[01:28:37.620 --> 01:28:38.620]  First time caller.
[01:28:38.620 --> 01:28:39.620]  Great.
[01:28:39.620 --> 01:28:40.620]  Go ahead.
[01:28:40.620 --> 01:28:41.620]  Yeah.
[01:28:41.620 --> 01:28:45.620]  I've been researching this sort of stuff since I was 17.
[01:28:45.620 --> 01:28:50.700]  I'm now 26, so I was awake quite early.
[01:28:50.700 --> 01:28:53.380]  I just want to make some points and give some advice.
[01:28:53.380 --> 01:28:54.380]  Go ahead.
[01:28:54.380 --> 01:28:55.380]  We've got about one minute before break.
[01:28:55.380 --> 01:28:56.380]  Go ahead.
[01:28:56.380 --> 01:28:57.380]  Okay.
[01:28:57.380 --> 01:29:04.020]  But people haven't looked at this in an overall way because over here, when internet-ready
[01:29:04.020 --> 01:29:11.580]  computers were first given to us, all the newspapers all said, and to be frank, they
[01:29:11.580 --> 01:29:18.140]  all said, oh my God, it's got pornography on it, it's terrible, blah, blah, blah.
[01:29:18.140 --> 01:29:22.540]  But immediately, everyone started buying computers.
[01:29:22.540 --> 01:29:31.420]  And I think the whole idea of people buying a personal computer and then advertising it
[01:29:31.420 --> 01:29:38.860]  as having porn on it and things like that was an advert to get people to use this.
[01:29:38.860 --> 01:29:41.540]  Well, some interesting points there about invading the culture.
[01:29:41.540 --> 01:29:45.620]  We've got to go to break, Simon, I apologize, but thank you for your points.
[01:29:45.620 --> 01:29:46.620]  And stay with us.
[01:29:46.620 --> 01:29:48.380]  John Rappaport comes up after this break.
[01:29:48.380 --> 01:29:50.260]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:29:50.260 --> 01:29:51.540]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.540 --> 01:29:54.260]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.260 --> 01:30:00.940]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.940 --> 01:30:03.660]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[01:30:03.660 --> 01:30:08.780]  A prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:30:08.780 --> 01:30:14.820]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce
[01:30:14.820 --> 01:30:15.820]  to the global takeover.
[01:30:15.820 --> 01:30:21.300]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at Infowarsshop.com.
[01:30:21.300 --> 01:30:25.460]  These are items that I did research on that I personally use.

[01:31:05.940 --> 01:31:10.700]  system then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[01:31:10.700 --> 01:31:14.420]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?

[01:33:01.580 --> 01:33:12.060]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:12.060 --> 01:33:19.220]  Neil Cavuto went ballistic yesterday when interviewing people about the NSA spy scandal,
[01:33:19.220 --> 01:33:21.540]  and ballistic in a good way by the way.
[01:33:21.540 --> 01:33:23.940]  I admire what he said.
[01:33:23.940 --> 01:33:26.660]  He lost it and it was refreshing to see.
[01:33:26.660 --> 01:33:29.620]  He looked a little bit like Alex Jones on Piers Morgan.
[01:33:29.620 --> 01:33:35.500]  Let's actually go to that clip and listen to Neil Cavuto lay into these guests for just
[01:33:35.500 --> 01:33:39.860]  carrying their party line nonsense instead of actually addressing the issue that we're
[01:33:39.860 --> 01:33:41.060]  all being spied on.
[01:33:41.060 --> 01:33:42.060]  Here's Neil.
[01:33:42.060 --> 01:33:46.440]  ... investigative reporting and not protecting the First Amendment in this country.
[01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:51.380]  People are seriously in doubt about whether the White House is looking out for this country's
[01:33:51.380 --> 01:33:52.380]  best interest.
[01:33:52.380 --> 01:33:53.380]  It's the creepiness factor.
[01:33:53.380 --> 01:33:54.380]  And I understand that.
[01:33:54.380 --> 01:33:55.380]  It's the creepiness factor.
[01:33:55.380 --> 01:33:58.940]  Julian, I mean, I guess what I'm asking you is what part of Custer don't you understand
[01:33:58.940 --> 01:33:59.940]  there?
[01:33:59.940 --> 01:34:02.580]  Where you're surrounded and you see one incident after another that comes up.
[01:34:02.580 --> 01:34:04.580]  Now listen to this liberal make excuses.
[01:34:04.580 --> 01:34:11.060]  It comes back to the same basic issue, privacy's invaded or potentially invaded, institutions
[01:34:11.060 --> 01:34:14.620]  of all sorts doing pretty much the same thing.
[01:34:14.620 --> 01:34:16.060]  There is a pattern.
[01:34:16.060 --> 01:34:19.740]  If you want to conflate and combine all these issues and then make these general statements,
[01:34:19.740 --> 01:34:20.740]  you can do that.
[01:34:20.740 --> 01:34:22.820]  I just don't think it's a very thoughtful way of approaching it.
[01:34:22.820 --> 01:34:25.460]  Why don't you think about what I just said, Julian?
[01:34:25.460 --> 01:34:27.460]  I'm asking you to think about that goal.
[01:34:27.460 --> 01:34:30.540]  I don't see, I don't connect the dots.
[01:34:30.540 --> 01:34:31.540]  I don't connect the dots.
[01:34:31.540 --> 01:34:35.900]  Julian, I'm telling you, drop the liberal thing and focus on the reality thing.
[01:34:35.900 --> 01:34:40.560]  You have one entity after another going after the American people.
[01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:45.720]  You have one system of government, one agency, one department after another essentially doing
[01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:46.980]  the same thing.
[01:34:46.980 --> 01:34:48.660]  You can call that conflating.
[01:34:48.660 --> 01:34:52.140]  I am telling you there's a pattern and you're just rubbing your shoulders.
[01:34:52.140 --> 01:34:55.940]  But I guarantee you, Julian, if it were George Bush doing it, you would rightly be all over
[01:34:55.940 --> 01:34:56.940]  it.
[01:34:56.940 --> 01:35:02.260]  Let's face it, you want me to respond?
[01:35:02.260 --> 01:35:05.380]  So look, you can't conflate all of these issues.
[01:35:05.380 --> 01:35:08.540]  You have to speak about them simply because they're very different.
[01:35:08.540 --> 01:35:12.080]  In the case of the IRS, I agree the targeting was wrong, but there was never any connection
[01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:13.940]  to the White House and nobody's proven that.
[01:35:13.940 --> 01:35:19.940]  In the case of the AP case, there was no, no one was criminalizing investigative reporting.
[01:35:19.940 --> 01:35:22.900]  Nobody in the Justice Department ever spoke about prosecuting Rosen.
[01:35:22.900 --> 01:35:27.540]  That was simply a method to get us to call them a couple of emails that is not targeting
[01:35:27.540 --> 01:35:28.540]  call them a couple.
[01:35:28.540 --> 01:35:33.940]  Secondly, secondly, on the emails, the White House, Julian, because I want to talk facts
[01:35:33.940 --> 01:35:37.380]  and you want to make these general broadsides, I'm sorry, Julian, you're saying nothing and
[01:35:37.380 --> 01:35:40.820]  it's offensive because why don't we speak about them specifically?
[01:35:40.820 --> 01:35:41.820]  Let's speak up.
[01:35:41.820 --> 01:35:42.820]  Let's let's debate.
[01:35:42.820 --> 01:35:58.020]  It's nice to see him actually get a little angry about that.
[01:35:58.020 --> 01:36:03.140]  Where did these liberal reporters get off on this idea, oh, you can't conflate these
[01:36:03.140 --> 01:36:04.140]  issues?
[01:36:04.140 --> 01:36:08.580]  You know what they're saying is you can't talk about more than one thing.
[01:36:08.580 --> 01:36:11.740]  I mean, oh, wait a minute, there's a pattern here.
[01:36:11.740 --> 01:36:15.540]  There's the IRS, there's the DOJ, there's the NSA.
[01:36:15.540 --> 01:36:19.500]  There's all the lies that Obama told when he was running for office that turned out
[01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:23.580]  he's continuing the things he said he would stop like the secret military prisons.
[01:36:23.580 --> 01:36:26.140]  And you can't quote, conflate these issues.
[01:36:26.140 --> 01:36:29.560]  You can't talk about more things, more than one thing at a time.
[01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:30.960]  You can't connect the dots.
[01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:32.540]  Are you kidding me?
[01:36:32.540 --> 01:36:33.540]  It's insane.
[01:36:33.540 --> 01:36:39.020]  Good job Cavuto in this case going after these guys actually appreciate your outrage on the
[01:36:39.020 --> 01:36:40.020]  air Cavuto.
[01:36:40.020 --> 01:36:44.660]  Now, to give us some more context on this, we're joined now by John Rappaport, a great
[01:36:44.660 --> 01:36:46.780]  analyst and researcher and writer.
[01:36:46.780 --> 01:36:50.340]  His website is nomorefakenews.com.
[01:36:50.340 --> 01:36:51.980]  The name says it all.
[01:36:51.980 --> 01:36:55.260]  John Rappaport joins us now by Skype for additional analysis.
[01:36:55.260 --> 01:37:00.860]  John, what did you think of Neil Cavuto going ballistic in a good way?
[01:37:00.860 --> 01:37:01.860]  Hey, Mike.
[01:37:01.860 --> 01:37:03.820]  Well, I think we need more of that.
[01:37:03.820 --> 01:37:10.540]  I think we need more ballisticism from these guys who are finally getting set up.
[01:37:10.540 --> 01:37:15.500]  I don't care whether they're on the left or the right or the middle or up or down.
[01:37:15.500 --> 01:37:21.820]  You know, it just gets to a point where even they have a tough time pretending that it's
[01:37:21.820 --> 01:37:28.740]  all very neutral and we're having a conversation about these things because it's all completely
[01:37:28.740 --> 01:37:29.740]  insane.
[01:37:29.740 --> 01:37:36.060]  The government wants to get into your pants, into your brain, into everything you've got,
[01:37:36.060 --> 01:37:41.500]  into your bank and they'll do whatever it takes and they are doing whatever it takes.
[01:37:41.500 --> 01:37:47.320]  And so this latest revelation about the NSA is just one more monster on top of all the
[01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:54.080]  other monsters and it also indicts all the corporations, the tech companies who have
[01:37:54.080 --> 01:38:00.900]  been complying and agreeing and lying and obfuscating about the fact that they're all
[01:38:00.900 --> 01:38:01.900]  in it together.
[01:38:01.900 --> 01:38:07.020]  Well, yeah, that's why Cavuto said, quote, drop the liberal thing and just answer the
[01:38:07.020 --> 01:38:09.420]  freaking question, act like a human being.
[01:38:09.420 --> 01:38:11.420]  We're all being spied on.
[01:38:11.420 --> 01:38:15.820]  Forget about who's in the White House for a minute and just think like a human being.
[01:38:15.820 --> 01:38:18.080]  But these liberals refuse to do that.
[01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:22.460]  They want their guy in the White House to be on the winning team.
[01:38:22.460 --> 01:38:26.060]  And as Cavuto said, if Bush was in the White House and this was going on, the left will
[01:38:26.060 --> 01:38:28.760]  be screaming bloody murder over all the spy scandals.
[01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:31.100]  But now that Obama is in, it's OK.
[01:38:31.100 --> 01:38:34.500]  Bill Maher says, oh, it's fine because I trust Obama.
[01:38:34.500 --> 01:38:35.500]  Really?
[01:38:35.500 --> 01:38:36.500]  Are you that stupid?
[01:38:36.500 --> 01:38:37.500]  Come on.
[01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:42.620]  Well, he gave him a million bucks, so I guess he has to defend him.
[01:38:42.620 --> 01:38:48.460]  But yeah, you know, if Bush were in the White House now, the Republicans would be defending
[01:38:48.460 --> 01:38:49.460]  him.
[01:38:49.460 --> 01:38:55.700]  They would be saying, well, there is no thing that we must refrain from doing to protect
[01:38:55.700 --> 01:38:58.380]  the security of the United States.
[01:38:58.380 --> 01:39:03.380]  And if we have to put everybody under hypnotic drugs 24 hours a day all over the world to
[01:39:03.380 --> 01:39:08.820]  do it, more to do it because we'll all be safe then and everybody will be peaceful.
[01:39:08.820 --> 01:39:14.980]  So these people just keep on switching sides and going back and forth because they're paid
[01:39:14.980 --> 01:39:15.980]  to do that.
[01:39:15.980 --> 01:39:19.220]  I mean, well, why they send their kids to college.
[01:39:19.220 --> 01:39:20.980]  That's how they can afford their house payments.
[01:39:20.980 --> 01:39:23.780]  And let's remember how this all began.
[01:39:23.780 --> 01:39:29.960]  Let's go back to the so-called terror attacks of 9-11 and then the outrage and the Bush
[01:39:29.960 --> 01:39:35.540]  era pushing of the Patriot Act and how all the Republicans said, yeah, let's give up
[01:39:35.540 --> 01:39:36.540]  our rights.
[01:39:36.540 --> 01:39:40.940]  And now those same Republicans are screaming, well, Obama's taking our rights.
[01:39:40.940 --> 01:39:42.420]  You gave them to him.
[01:39:42.420 --> 01:39:43.420]  Come on, people.
[01:39:43.420 --> 01:39:44.420]  I mean, come on.
[01:39:44.420 --> 01:39:46.420]  Look in the mirror.
[01:39:46.420 --> 01:39:47.420]  Where did that all start?
[01:39:47.420 --> 01:39:48.420]  Yeah, right.
[01:39:48.420 --> 01:39:51.100]  And let's go to war in Iraq.
[01:39:51.100 --> 01:39:53.100]  Yes, we have to go to war in Iraq.
[01:39:53.100 --> 01:39:54.700]  Why are we going to war in Iraq again?
[01:39:54.700 --> 01:39:55.700]  I can't remember.
[01:39:55.700 --> 01:39:56.700]  Oh, yeah.
[01:39:56.700 --> 01:39:57.700]  WMDs.
[01:39:57.700 --> 01:39:58.700]  Where are they?
[01:39:58.700 --> 01:39:59.740]  I don't know.
[01:39:59.740 --> 01:40:01.620]  But let's go to war anyway.
[01:40:01.620 --> 01:40:06.180]  And let's let a lot of people get killed and let's kill a lot of people.
[01:40:06.180 --> 01:40:07.820]  It's a great thing.
[01:40:07.820 --> 01:40:11.500]  And we have to support the troops and this and that and the other thing.
[01:40:11.500 --> 01:40:18.580]  You know, when people can't get far enough back to see what's actually going on, they
[01:40:18.580 --> 01:40:23.020]  literally go insane because they're right in the middle of all this crossfire and they
[01:40:23.020 --> 01:40:30.660]  just begin to react negatively to everything that their training tells them they have to
[01:40:30.660 --> 01:40:31.660]  react to.
[01:40:31.660 --> 01:40:33.400]  It's just pure mind control.
[01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:37.580]  You've got to see the big picture here, you know, a slave state.
[01:40:37.580 --> 01:40:38.580]  That's what we're talking about.
[01:40:38.580 --> 01:40:39.740]  Yeah, total slave state.
[01:40:39.740 --> 01:40:44.700]  And we had a caller previously who brought up some very good points saying, hey, maybe
[01:40:44.700 --> 01:40:49.660]  that key decision about Obamacare by a Supreme Court justice who changed his mind last minute,
[01:40:49.660 --> 01:40:52.980]  maybe they got his private emails and threatened him with something.
[01:40:52.980 --> 01:40:57.320]  You know, maybe Petraeus was threatened or they got his emails and then were able to
[01:40:57.320 --> 01:41:01.420]  expose his affair and kick him out of power.
[01:41:01.420 --> 01:41:06.260]  I mean, they've probably been using this all along to get certain people out of the way
[01:41:06.260 --> 01:41:08.540]  and get other people to change their decisions.
[01:41:08.540 --> 01:41:11.540]  Oh, yeah, no question about it.
[01:41:11.540 --> 01:41:15.260]  And another thing that the public is very confused about.
[01:41:15.260 --> 01:41:23.260]  You know, you don't have to say that Petraeus is a saint in order to say at the same time
[01:41:23.260 --> 01:41:30.680]  that he was railroaded and discredited because he was saying things that the administration
[01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:32.460]  didn't want him to say, right?
[01:41:32.460 --> 01:41:34.820]  It's not black or white folks.
[01:41:34.820 --> 01:41:35.820]  Wake up.
[01:41:35.820 --> 01:41:39.420]  You know, because people get all in a tizzy about that.
[01:41:39.420 --> 01:41:43.100]  Well, so you're defending Petraeus and you're saying that he's the most one?
[01:41:43.100 --> 01:41:44.100]  No.
[01:41:44.100 --> 01:41:47.120]  Just saying that this is how they take people down.
[01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:55.300]  And by the way, since you mentioned Obamacare, Mike, all of this spying and surveilling and
[01:41:55.300 --> 01:42:02.260]  record keeping and so forth, let us not forget that your medical records are going to be
[01:42:02.260 --> 01:42:03.900]  added into this matrix.
[01:42:03.900 --> 01:42:11.420]  Every single thing that happens in the doctor's office is all going to be part of your profile
[01:42:11.420 --> 01:42:17.860]  that is assembled by the NSA and the FBI and the CIA and every other agency, DHS is working
[01:42:17.860 --> 01:42:23.020]  on this to complete a whole picture of you.
[01:42:23.020 --> 01:42:25.140]  And those medical records will be right in there.
[01:42:25.140 --> 01:42:29.360]  The same government that's spying on your email, grabbing your logins and passwords
[01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:35.300]  and listening to your phone calls is now going to know about your erectile dysfunction problem.
[01:42:35.300 --> 01:42:36.980]  How wonderful is that?
[01:42:36.980 --> 01:42:42.700]  And if they see fit to blackmail you or extort you with that, they will.
[01:42:42.700 --> 01:42:44.200]  Absolutely.
[01:42:44.200 --> 01:42:48.860]  By the way, sir, you don't know me, but how's the Viagra working out?
[01:42:48.860 --> 01:42:49.860]  Yeah, right.
[01:42:49.860 --> 01:42:50.860]  Yeah.
[01:42:50.860 --> 01:42:51.860]  Secret phone call.
[01:42:51.860 --> 01:42:52.860]  Sit down.
[01:42:52.860 --> 01:42:55.720]  Let's have a little conversation because you've been doing some things here as a congressman
[01:42:55.720 --> 01:42:59.660]  that we think you ought to have second thoughts about.
[01:42:59.660 --> 01:43:00.660]  Boom.
[01:43:00.660 --> 01:43:03.780]  Yeah, like voting for an extension of Obamacare.
[01:43:03.780 --> 01:43:10.900]  Come January 1, believe me, these state exchanges are going to just implode with technical problems.
[01:43:10.900 --> 01:43:13.300]  But let's go to some phone calls, John.
[01:43:13.300 --> 01:43:15.780]  Let's bring in some callers because we've had such great calls today.
[01:43:15.780 --> 01:43:18.220]  We've got a caller on the line, Linda from Boston.
[01:43:18.220 --> 01:43:20.980]  The note I have here is that it's bigger than the NSA.
[01:43:20.980 --> 01:43:23.720]  So Linda from Boston, you're on the air with John Rappaport.
[01:43:23.720 --> 01:43:27.300]  Go ahead, Linda.
[01:43:27.300 --> 01:43:29.300]  Are you there?
[01:43:29.300 --> 01:43:31.460]  Linda.
[01:43:31.460 --> 01:43:35.660]  I think the NSA was listening to her phone call and she called in and they already took
[01:43:35.660 --> 01:43:36.660]  care of her.
[01:43:36.660 --> 01:43:37.660]  Yeah.
[01:43:37.660 --> 01:43:38.660]  That's too bad.
[01:43:38.660 --> 01:43:40.740]  Let's go to John in Wisconsin fighting the new world order.
[01:43:40.740 --> 01:43:41.980]  John, you're on the air.
[01:43:41.980 --> 01:43:42.980]  Hello.
[01:43:42.980 --> 01:43:45.340]  Hey there, you're on the air.
[01:43:45.340 --> 01:43:46.660]  You're on the air.
[01:43:46.660 --> 01:43:47.660]  Yeah.
[01:43:47.660 --> 01:43:52.700]  Well, I first wanted to thank Alex and the show for years ago, about 10 years ago, he
[01:43:52.700 --> 01:43:56.100]  used to end the show with the unction or the exhortation, go fight, go out and fight the
[01:43:56.100 --> 01:43:57.100]  new world order.
[01:43:57.100 --> 01:43:59.500]  I have enjoyed doing that.
[01:43:59.500 --> 01:44:05.160]  A couple of things with Perry's emails and now trying to get some of that video footage
[01:44:05.160 --> 01:44:08.540]  from the Boston Marathon, it's a little thing I could do.
[01:44:08.540 --> 01:44:13.620]  And that's kind of what I think our next step is as citizens is, hey, you know, this machinery
[01:44:13.620 --> 01:44:19.380]  has gotten really large, somewhere this gear work of tyranny is spinning near you.
[01:44:19.380 --> 01:44:25.140]  And I firmly believe that somewhere you have the standard in your hand to stick it in.
[01:44:25.140 --> 01:44:29.860]  And we just all have to do our little parts and whichever way we can to just get in the
[01:44:29.860 --> 01:44:30.860]  way.
[01:44:30.860 --> 01:44:31.860]  Well, good point, John.
[01:44:31.860 --> 01:44:32.860]  Great question.
[01:44:32.860 --> 01:44:35.540]  John Rappaport, now, please answer that.
[01:44:35.540 --> 01:44:40.660]  How do we take action against this incredible spy grid that seems almost omniscient and
[01:44:40.660 --> 01:44:41.700]  knows all our secrets?
[01:44:41.700 --> 01:44:45.300]  How do you even, how do you stop a system like that?
[01:44:45.300 --> 01:44:52.620]  Well, I suggested I'm working on an article now, I think people have to use their imaginations.
[01:44:52.620 --> 01:44:58.220]  For example, how about videotaping yourself as you go around, you know, your daily life
[01:44:58.220 --> 01:45:02.260]  and then send the video files to the NSA?
[01:45:02.260 --> 01:45:04.580]  Help them, help them.
[01:45:04.580 --> 01:45:09.980]  So what would happen if 50,000 people started taping themselves and saying, you know, we
[01:45:09.980 --> 01:45:14.020]  are loyal patriotic Americans and we believe that we should be spied on.
[01:45:14.020 --> 01:45:16.980]  In fact, we don't think you're doing a good enough job.
[01:45:16.980 --> 01:45:22.400]  So we want to fill up your email boxes with public information, with videos of us living
[01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:24.720]  our lives every day.
[01:45:24.720 --> 01:45:30.260]  And you can look at all of it, you see, and all of a sudden this gets to be a story.
[01:45:30.260 --> 01:45:31.820]  Look at what's happening here.
[01:45:31.820 --> 01:45:34.620]  This gets to be a gigantic joke on the NSA.
[01:45:34.620 --> 01:45:37.100]  How do you even send the video to the NSA?
[01:45:37.100 --> 01:45:40.720]  Seems like the only way you can get it into their hands is by sending it through a service
[01:45:40.720 --> 01:45:43.380]  where you don't want them to spy on you.
[01:45:43.380 --> 01:45:47.720]  It's not like they have an inbox where you can voluntarily submit.
[01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:51.620]  They only get things illegally.
[01:45:51.620 --> 01:45:52.820]  They do have public outreach.
[01:45:52.820 --> 01:46:00.540]  I mean, every organization does, you know, public information officer, press office liaisons
[01:46:00.540 --> 01:46:06.980]  to the public, public education that they do, all this sort of insanity.
[01:46:06.980 --> 01:46:12.420]  And if you look hard enough, I've done this as a reporter, oh, look, here's an email address.
[01:46:12.420 --> 01:46:14.300]  And I think I'll send somebody an email here.
[01:46:14.300 --> 01:46:16.420]  And lo and behold, it gets through.
[01:46:16.420 --> 01:46:22.180]  Just like, well, you can't walk into the White House and talk to Obama, but you can get to
[01:46:22.180 --> 01:46:25.720]  the White House through various email addresses and so forth.
[01:46:25.720 --> 01:46:31.860]  Or you could say, oh, look at that, you posted up on YouTube, an open confession to the NSA.
[01:46:31.860 --> 01:46:33.180]  Here's what I've really been doing.
[01:46:33.180 --> 01:46:34.660]  So 50 or 100,000 people-
[01:46:34.660 --> 01:46:35.980]  Here's my boring life.
[01:46:35.980 --> 01:46:39.060]  I was picking carrots this morning.
[01:46:39.060 --> 01:46:40.900]  Yeah, talk about a spanner.
[01:46:40.900 --> 01:46:45.420]  I mean, you have to, you know, you have to think imaginatively here.
[01:46:45.420 --> 01:46:49.140]  You have to turn the tables on them in some way.
[01:46:49.140 --> 01:46:52.540]  There's all kinds of things that people could figure out if they give a little thought and
[01:46:52.540 --> 01:46:53.540]  imagination to you.
[01:46:53.540 --> 01:46:54.540]  You'd be surprised.
[01:46:54.540 --> 01:46:59.660]  I can just see the NSA, some analysts assigned to my life, they'd be bored out of their minds.
[01:46:59.660 --> 01:47:01.540]  Oh, he's feeding the chickens again.
[01:47:01.540 --> 01:47:02.540]  Okay.
[01:47:02.540 --> 01:47:04.580]  Oh, my God, he's milking the goats.
[01:47:04.580 --> 01:47:07.020]  Uh-oh, I wonder if that's raw milk.
[01:47:07.020 --> 01:47:08.020]  Yeah.
[01:47:08.020 --> 01:47:09.980]  He might be a terrorist.
[01:47:09.980 --> 01:47:11.740]  He's going after the farm animals.
[01:47:11.740 --> 01:47:12.740]  Almost certainly.
[01:47:12.740 --> 01:47:14.740]  Driving a tractor.
[01:47:14.740 --> 01:47:22.260]  Yeah, my life, I'm sure I'm flagged as a terrorist on multiple fronts, you know, just for growing
[01:47:22.260 --> 01:47:23.260]  food, you know.
[01:47:23.260 --> 01:47:24.260]  Too late for you.
[01:47:24.260 --> 01:47:25.260]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:47:25.260 --> 01:47:27.140]  Well, check this out.
[01:47:27.140 --> 01:47:31.580]  Representative Steve Stockman, a congressman from Texas, he's going to be joining us, by
[01:47:31.580 --> 01:47:32.580]  the way, in the next hour.
[01:47:32.580 --> 01:47:37.660]  He's got some hilarious tweets that he put out over the weekend on the spy scandal.
[01:47:37.660 --> 01:47:41.180]  And one of his tweets was as follows, and I want your comments on this, John, and then
[01:47:41.180 --> 01:47:45.460]  we'll probably take some more calls, quote, at this point, the only way to prevent people
[01:47:45.460 --> 01:47:52.060]  from hearing your conversations is to have them on MSNBC.
[01:47:52.060 --> 01:47:53.060]  That's a good one.
[01:47:53.060 --> 01:47:54.060]  Yeah.
[01:47:54.060 --> 01:47:55.060]  I think that's very good.
[01:47:55.060 --> 01:47:56.060]  Sure.
[01:47:56.060 --> 01:47:58.780]  There's only, I don't know, they only have a few hundred thousand people watching out
[01:47:58.780 --> 01:48:01.620]  of 300 and something million on MSNBC.
[01:48:01.620 --> 01:48:03.780]  Yeah, that's a good one.
[01:48:03.780 --> 01:48:04.780]  I like that.
[01:48:04.780 --> 01:48:05.780]  Yeah.
[01:48:05.780 --> 01:48:06.780]  Well, let's take another call then.
[01:48:06.780 --> 01:48:07.780]  Okay.
[01:48:07.780 --> 01:48:08.780]  Sure.
[01:48:08.780 --> 01:48:09.780]  All right.
[01:48:09.780 --> 01:48:10.780]  Let's go to Francis in North Carolina.
[01:48:10.780 --> 01:48:13.980]  Francis, you're on the air with John Rappaport and Mike Adams here.
[01:48:13.980 --> 01:48:14.980]  Go ahead.
[01:48:14.980 --> 01:48:18.980]  Good day to you both for that matter.
[01:48:18.980 --> 01:48:25.140]  And as much as there is a surveillance grid and cameras, sensors this way, that way, of
[01:48:25.140 --> 01:48:30.140]  everyone's backside and so forth, if not them, there's one that I have not heard anybody
[01:48:30.140 --> 01:48:33.580]  address that I have taken note of for months.
[01:48:33.580 --> 01:48:42.180]  And this occurs at intersection either as you're stopping at a red light or even after
[01:48:42.180 --> 01:48:47.500]  you pass the intersection, they are placed in the pavement after an intersection.
[01:48:47.500 --> 01:48:53.580]  If anyone happens to pay attention and look at these lines that are cut in their pavement,
[01:48:53.580 --> 01:48:56.300]  on the West Coast, they look like circles.
[01:48:56.300 --> 01:48:59.900]  On the East Coast, they look like squares or rectangles or whatever that are actually
[01:48:59.900 --> 01:49:01.940]  cut into the pavement.
[01:49:01.940 --> 01:49:07.940]  And the only thing I can surmise is that they are wires or magnetic strips of some sort
[01:49:07.940 --> 01:49:12.620]  that actually can scan your vehicle when you pass over it.
[01:49:12.620 --> 01:49:14.820]  That's an interesting idea.
[01:49:14.820 --> 01:49:16.420]  I wouldn't put it past the NSA.
[01:49:16.420 --> 01:49:17.420]  What do you think, John?
[01:49:17.420 --> 01:49:18.420]  Is something like that going to happen?
[01:49:18.420 --> 01:49:22.340]  I haven't heard of that particular thing, assuming that it's not just to regulate traffic
[01:49:22.340 --> 01:49:23.900]  lights and so forth.
[01:49:23.900 --> 01:49:24.900]  Yeah.
[01:49:24.900 --> 01:49:27.060]  So look into that one.
[01:49:27.060 --> 01:49:30.740]  What if every car is built with an RFID system already built into it?
[01:49:30.740 --> 01:49:34.980]  You know they're trying to put black boxes into the cars, but what if the caller is right?
[01:49:34.980 --> 01:49:40.960]  Maybe they have an RFID transponder, and every time you drive over one of these intersections,
[01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:45.620]  the location of your car gets uploaded to the NSA, which they cross-reference with your
[01:49:45.620 --> 01:49:46.900]  phone calls and everything else.
[01:49:46.900 --> 01:49:49.660]  I mean, it's just another layer of tracking.
[01:49:49.660 --> 01:49:50.660]  It could be true.
[01:49:50.660 --> 01:49:51.980]  It could definitely be true.
[01:49:51.980 --> 01:49:58.140]  The whole point of this is that they want to, and they're getting closer and closer
[01:49:58.140 --> 01:50:04.420]  to be able to track everybody all the time in real time, wherever they are, whatever
[01:50:04.420 --> 01:50:07.780]  they do, whatever they say, wherever they go.
[01:50:07.780 --> 01:50:09.240]  That's the mission.
[01:50:09.240 --> 01:50:10.780]  That's their mission statement.
[01:50:10.780 --> 01:50:12.940]  Has nothing to do with stopping terrorism.
[01:50:12.940 --> 01:50:14.400]  Has to do with control.
[01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:15.580]  That's what they're after.
[01:50:15.580 --> 01:50:17.580]  That's what they've always been after.
[01:50:17.580 --> 01:50:24.660]  And these monsters that are committing crimes every day that run these super spy networks,
[01:50:24.660 --> 01:50:34.380]  they are the people who are the technicians for, we call it the police state, and so on.
[01:50:34.380 --> 01:50:37.220]  And all of the spin-offs that we've been hearing, for example-
[01:50:37.220 --> 01:50:40.460]  John, we're going to go to break here, but we'll continue with you on the other side
[01:50:40.460 --> 01:50:42.380]  of that break, and thank you for that caller.
[01:50:42.380 --> 01:50:43.380]  That's very interesting.
[01:50:43.380 --> 01:50:47.320]  Hey, if they're not tracking your cars with RFIDs, they're certainly taking pictures of
[01:50:47.320 --> 01:50:52.780]  you and using facial recognition algorithms to see who's driving your car and where else
[01:50:52.780 --> 01:50:54.540]  you might be going on that same day.
[01:50:54.540 --> 01:50:55.820]  This is the Alex Jones Show.

[01:53:00.460 --> 01:53:05.180]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the bestselling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[01:53:05.180 --> 01:53:10.620]  I want you to know some very important information. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan
[01:53:10.620 --> 01:53:15.180]  requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President
[01:53:15.180 --> 01:53:20.220]  could obtain this world-class healer. Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules
[01:53:20.220 --> 01:53:25.180]  are used around the world to keep people healthy. Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones
[01:53:25.180 --> 01:53:30.460]  in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond
[01:53:30.460 --> 01:53:35.580]  to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell. If you want to stay healthy,
[01:53:35.580 --> 01:53:39.980]  now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders

[01:53:58.220 --> 01:54:02.300]  It's the only one you've got.
[01:54:11.180 --> 01:54:17.820]  I love how when Bush was in office, all these Democrats and liberals were screaming about
[01:54:17.820 --> 01:54:24.140]  Bush's terrible police state. Oh my God, this guy is spying on us. He's got the Patriot Act. He's
[01:54:24.140 --> 01:54:31.020]  threatening our civil rights. Call the ACLU. In fact, let's nominate a man for president
[01:54:31.020 --> 01:54:37.260]  who's a constitutional scholar named Obama. And then when Obama gets into office, all these same
[01:54:37.260 --> 01:54:44.700]  people who are so intellectually just dishonest, betraying every principle as long as there are
[01:54:44.700 --> 01:54:50.140]  guys in office, all these same liberals and Democrats say, what, spying? We love to be
[01:54:50.140 --> 01:54:56.060]  spied on. We love it. Obama's in office. We love to be spied on now. Surveillance. Go surveillance.
[01:54:56.060 --> 01:55:00.300]  More, more, more. Who cares about the Constitution? Who cares about the Bill of Rights? Our guys in
[01:55:00.300 --> 01:55:05.660]  the White House. We're winning, winning, winning. That's what they do. I mean, how pathetic is that,
[01:55:05.660 --> 01:55:14.860]  John Rappaport? Yeah. And why do people vote? You know, if they only have a choice between
[01:55:14.860 --> 01:55:22.940]  two jackasses, when either go to a third party, if there's somebody really who stands for freedom,
[01:55:23.820 --> 01:55:31.980]  or just opt out completely. Because, you know, face it, somebody's going to the polls to put
[01:55:31.980 --> 01:55:38.460]  these criminal morons in office every couple of years, four years, six years, depending on which
[01:55:38.460 --> 01:55:46.140]  depending on which position they hold. And they perform the same way year after year, decade after
[01:55:46.140 --> 01:55:54.060]  decade. And yet people still allow these people to run Washington DC to the degree that they do.
[01:55:54.060 --> 01:56:01.340]  It's just completely insane. It's incredible. Yeah, I mean, how stupid, how completely stupid.
[01:56:01.340 --> 01:56:08.700]  So one possible example of hope, real hope for real change, not the fake hope and change that
[01:56:08.700 --> 01:56:15.660]  we've been offered is a real example is Rand Paul. And we're going to cut to a video of him
[01:56:15.660 --> 01:56:21.100]  describing what he wants to do to challenge this NSA spy grid all the way up to the Supreme Court.
[01:56:21.100 --> 01:56:22.940]  Let's roll a couple of minutes of that. Go ahead, guys.
[01:56:24.460 --> 01:56:29.260]  Well, you know, they're looking at a billion phone calls a day is what I read in the press.
[01:56:29.260 --> 01:56:33.340]  And that doesn't sound to me like a modest invasion of privacy. It sounds like an
[01:56:33.340 --> 01:56:39.260]  extraordinary invasion of privacy. The Fourth Amendment says that you have to look at and you
[01:56:39.260 --> 01:56:46.060]  can ask for a warrant for a specific to a person placed in the items. This is a general warrant.
[01:56:46.060 --> 01:56:50.940]  This is what we objected to. What our founding fathers partly fought the revolution over
[01:56:50.940 --> 01:56:55.180]  is they did not want generalized warrants where you could go from house to house with soldiers
[01:56:55.180 --> 01:57:00.700]  looking for things or now from computer to computer to phone to phone without specifying
[01:57:00.700 --> 01:57:06.860]  who you're targeting. Well, let's look at the effects of the Internet surveillance program as
[01:57:06.860 --> 01:57:12.140]  opposed to the phone surveillance program in two thousand. That's enough. Rand Paul basically said
[01:57:12.140 --> 01:57:17.100]  it right there. John Rappaport, your comments on Rand Paul, if you were able to hear that clearly.
[01:57:17.100 --> 01:57:23.420]  Yeah, I was sure. I mean, if we've got people like him who are willing to press this issue and not
[01:57:23.420 --> 01:57:31.820]  just, you know, make a little press conference out of it and to actually force this up to higher
[01:57:31.820 --> 01:57:38.300]  levels, why not? But I'm afraid I'm not confident at all that the Supreme Court would do anything
[01:57:38.300 --> 01:57:42.860]  about it. Well, in question, the Supreme Court justices may all be compromised by the NSA.
[01:57:42.860 --> 01:57:48.300]  Yeah, of course. So then you have to ask who's really running things. Sure, I don't have a lot
[01:57:48.300 --> 01:57:54.540]  of faith in the Supreme Court coming out and deciding, yes, this is completely wrong and it
[01:57:54.540 --> 01:57:59.500]  has to be dismantled. They're not going to do that. They're not going to go over to the NSA and
[01:57:59.500 --> 01:58:08.780]  say, OK, guys, you've got here enough storage for six hundred quadrillion, you know, pieces
[01:58:08.780 --> 01:58:14.380]  of information. So we're going to limit you down to five million. Those are the only legal ones
[01:58:14.380 --> 01:58:19.100]  that you can have. You know, they're not going to do that. They're going to make some kind of
[01:58:19.100 --> 01:58:26.620]  concession. Yes. You can't cut your fingernails in the lobby of the NSA building anymore.
[01:58:26.620 --> 01:58:30.780]  OK, that's where we're going. No, it's clear the NSA is going to keep lying to Congress,
[01:58:30.780 --> 01:58:34.940]  lying to the public. And we're going to get the Supreme Court and lie to the Supreme Court.
[01:58:34.940 --> 01:58:39.020]  Absolutely. This is the Alex Jones show. More analysis straight ahead. We'll be back in one

[01:59:36.460 --> 01:59:41.340]  of the New World Order's hellish plan. The police state isn't coming. It's here.

[02:00:21.660 --> 02:00:29.900]  All right, I want to mention that there is one way you can fight back against this system,
[02:00:29.900 --> 02:00:35.020]  and that is by growing your own food. And, you know, I'm a big advocate of this. I'm into
[02:00:35.020 --> 02:00:40.700]  aquaponics. I'm into farming. I'm into self-reliance. And, of course, you know,
[02:00:40.700 --> 02:00:47.020]  preparedness, just basic preparedness. The Boy Scout motto before things turned recently.
[02:00:47.020 --> 02:00:53.420]  So the survival seed vault by my patriot supply is available at info wars store dot com. And I
[02:00:53.420 --> 02:00:58.220]  want to encourage you to check that out. It's a it's a collection of one hundred percent non GMO
[02:00:58.220 --> 02:01:05.180]  open pollinated seeds. And I've got tons of seeds as part of not just to grow food, but also to
[02:01:05.180 --> 02:01:09.900]  barter with people because people are going to need seeds. So I think seeds I think of seeds
[02:01:09.900 --> 02:01:15.420]  as a kind of currency, actually. So help support the show here and check that out at info wars
[02:01:15.420 --> 02:01:20.380]  store dot com. And by the way, just in case you're curious, I don't have any financial interest in
[02:01:20.940 --> 02:01:25.660]  actually anything that I've promoted here, the propure water filters or the seeds. I'm just
[02:01:26.540 --> 02:01:31.740]  helping to support the broadcast, which is why I'm also in here. Guest hosting now. John
[02:01:31.740 --> 02:01:37.500]  Rappaport has also been a guest host here before. Lots of us are are pulling for the truth. We are
[02:01:37.500 --> 02:01:41.980]  helping to promote alternative media because this is the only media where you're going to get the
[02:01:41.980 --> 02:01:47.260]  truth. I mean, think about the march against Monsanto all across the country. The mainstream
[02:01:47.260 --> 02:01:54.140]  media pretended the march never happened. Can you believe that? So we're telling you the truth as
[02:01:54.140 --> 02:01:59.260]  best we see it. So John Rappaport continues with us here for the next few minutes. John,
[02:01:59.260 --> 02:02:04.540]  what would you like people to remember most from your interview today? What were the take home
[02:02:04.540 --> 02:02:12.940]  points from this NSA spy grid exploding in our faces? People who thought, you know, that it was
[02:02:12.940 --> 02:02:20.220]  only telephones. Yes, spying on phone calls. We knew all about that. And maybe they're able to
[02:02:20.220 --> 02:02:28.460]  track things on the Internet and so forth. But now we're talking about a colossus made up of these
[02:02:28.460 --> 02:02:35.100]  huge tech companies. Google and AOL and, you know, all the way down the line, Microsoft,
[02:02:35.100 --> 02:02:42.940]  Apple, such and such, all the way. And NSA working together as one monster deciding
[02:02:44.380 --> 02:02:49.980]  what to do about what they know about you. And they're collecting everything in the capability
[02:02:49.980 --> 02:02:55.900]  of collecting it. And that's not only illegal, it's not only criminal, it's not only like a
[02:02:55.900 --> 02:03:03.500]  gigantic crime family, which it is, but it's all about freedom. And that's the thing to never give
[02:03:03.500 --> 02:03:10.780]  up on, to understand what your freedom means, what it is, and to resist any and all efforts to take
[02:03:10.780 --> 02:03:18.300]  it away from you. And from a tactical standpoint, it's very tricky to not allow the NSA to spy on
[02:03:18.300 --> 02:03:23.180]  you because they're into everything now. All these tech giants have back doors directly into
[02:03:23.180 --> 02:03:29.100]  the government. They're copying and data mining everything, your text, your voicemails, your Skype
[02:03:29.100 --> 02:03:35.900]  messages, your Facebook posts. How do you do that and still stay connected to our online world?
[02:03:35.900 --> 02:03:41.660]  I mean, what do you do? Go out and buy a Linux system and run Linux everything? A lot of people
[02:03:41.660 --> 02:03:47.180]  don't have the technical knowledge to do that. I certainly don't. All I can say, Mike, is that
[02:03:47.180 --> 02:03:53.740]  for a number of years now, there have been who knows how many thousands or even millions of
[02:03:53.740 --> 02:04:00.540]  people on the internet who decided they don't care. They just don't care. Yeah. Okay. They're
[02:04:00.540 --> 02:04:05.340]  spying on me. Sure. All right. So they know what I'm writing and they know what I'm reading.
[02:04:06.060 --> 02:04:11.820]  Does that mean that I'm going to stop doing what I'm doing? No, it means that I'm going to do more
[02:04:11.820 --> 02:04:19.340]  of what I've already been doing. That's the point. You do more of the good things and you
[02:04:19.900 --> 02:04:25.580]  and you just barrel straight ahead. Yes, there are. I'm sure there are things you can do to,
[02:04:25.580 --> 02:04:32.140]  you know, avoid the maximum possible amount of spying on you. But, you know, you're out there,
[02:04:32.140 --> 02:04:37.580]  so just be out there and do it and don't worry about, oh, I have to pull back.
[02:04:37.580 --> 02:04:42.460]  That's what they want you to do. They want you to go silent. Don't go silent. Yeah,
[02:04:42.460 --> 02:04:45.660]  they want to censor and intimidate. That's for sure. Well, that was John Rapoport, everybody,
[02:04:45.660 --> 02:04:51.820]  from NoMoreFakeNews.com. Thank you for joining us on the show today, John. Thanks so much, Mike.
[02:04:51.820 --> 02:04:55.100]  Always good to have you on. Stay with us. We've got Representative Steve Stockman,

[02:05:32.620 --> 02:05:37.900]  and the mandated ethanol production has dried up the feed supply for livestock. Chinese are

[02:08:16.140 --> 02:08:23.900]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[02:08:23.900 --> 02:08:27.740]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:31.740 --> 02:08:35.820]  All right, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. The third hour here. This is Mike Adams,
[02:08:35.820 --> 02:08:40.620]  the health ranger filling in for Alex. He'll be back on the show tomorrow. And you know,
[02:08:40.620 --> 02:08:47.660]  there's a huge backlash now forming against the NSA spy grid disclosures. Most people aren't happy
[02:08:47.660 --> 02:08:52.780]  to know that their private emails and phone calls are all being surveilled. I mean, their passwords,
[02:08:52.780 --> 02:09:00.860]  their files, their photos, you name it. It's Big Brother galore. It's Orwellian to the extreme.
[02:09:01.740 --> 02:09:06.380]  Orwell couldn't even have imagined this. It's unbelievable. Now, some of the comments that
[02:09:06.380 --> 02:09:11.580]  have been passed around the internet over the weekend about this are quite funny, even though
[02:09:11.580 --> 02:09:16.380]  this is a tragedy against the Fourth Amendment and the Bill of Rights. But there's a lot of
[02:09:16.380 --> 02:09:21.500]  comedy out there. And in fact, some of the best comedy came from Texas representative Steve
[02:09:21.500 --> 02:09:26.780]  Stockman, who was tweeting over the weekend some really fantastic tweets. I'll share a couple of
[02:09:26.780 --> 02:09:32.700]  them with you. And then he joins us on the show. He said, quote, someone should tell Obama 1984
[02:09:32.700 --> 02:09:38.700]  wasn't intended to be an instruction manual. And he said, this is my favorite one. At this point,
[02:09:38.700 --> 02:09:43.100]  the only way to prevent people from hearing your conversations is to have them on MSNBC.
[02:09:44.780 --> 02:09:49.980]  Yeah, I'm sure they will appreciate that one. But it's funny. So joining us now from Texas
[02:09:49.980 --> 02:09:56.060]  District Number 36, I believe, is Representative Steve Stockman. Mr. Stockman, welcome to the show.
[02:09:56.780 --> 02:10:02.060]  Thanks. One of the things we try to do is always have fun and making fun of liberals who can't
[02:10:02.060 --> 02:10:07.020]  have any more fun than that. I know you have to laugh at this because it's so
[02:10:07.020 --> 02:10:12.300]  insane. What were your initial thoughts when you became aware of these astonishing disclosures?
[02:10:12.860 --> 02:10:19.260]  Well, I mean, it follows with Obama's intent to focus on the citizens as the criminal and the
[02:10:20.060 --> 02:10:27.260]  terrorists are not to be investigated. You had the Russians sense a whole profile of what was
[02:10:27.260 --> 02:10:35.260]  potential terrorists. And instead of and also he subscribed to a terrorist magazine. And he
[02:10:35.260 --> 02:10:41.660]  subscribed and posted the terrorists websites. But that didn't rise to the level of interest. But the
[02:10:41.660 --> 02:10:50.140]  Tea Party and average citizens have become the target. It's alarming. We do live in a
[02:10:50.140 --> 02:10:57.660]  world where good is bad and bad is good. And it also targeted American citizens over over bad of
[02:10:57.660 --> 02:11:03.580]  terrorists. It's extraordinary how this apparatus has now been turned against the people. And I
[02:11:03.580 --> 02:11:10.380]  think I think you would agree with me on this, that this is being done outside of the the
[02:11:10.380 --> 02:11:15.980]  permission of Congress. I mean, Congress has been lied to by the NSA about this. Would you agree
[02:11:15.980 --> 02:11:20.780]  with that characterization? Or what are your thoughts? Well, there was an actual question
[02:11:21.420 --> 02:11:25.500]  in which they showed in the clip of it, where they're asking the head of NSA if there was a
[02:11:25.500 --> 02:11:31.660]  collection. I think it was a congressman, it may have been Weidman, who asked a direct question.
[02:11:32.540 --> 02:11:38.700]  Are you collecting massive amounts of data on each citizen? And the return back from him was no or
[02:11:38.700 --> 02:11:46.620]  none. So yeah, if they claim now that that was a miss, I think Diane Feinstein just said that it
[02:11:46.620 --> 02:11:52.700]  was just a misunderstanding of the question, which can be, I guess we could always say it's
[02:11:52.700 --> 02:11:58.460]  a misunderstanding. But what about what about the idea that this NSA system, it's almost omniscient.
[02:11:58.460 --> 02:12:03.980]  I mean, they they can keep tabs on anybody, including federal judges, including people like
[02:12:03.980 --> 02:12:10.620]  you, including your colleagues in the house, including senators. No one is safe from this.
[02:12:10.620 --> 02:12:17.260]  Do you see the potential for massive abuse on this? There is massive abuse already. I mean,
[02:12:17.260 --> 02:12:23.740]  it's alarming. If you think about it, these are the same guys now that want to register your guns,
[02:12:24.460 --> 02:12:29.260]  and they can't keep this kind of data private, yet they're claiming they can keep it private.
[02:12:29.260 --> 02:12:35.420]  If, if you register your guns, they're not going to let the data out. But clearly, we have a
[02:12:35.420 --> 02:12:44.700]  situation which they don't have control over the information. It's just it is it is overwhelming.
[02:12:44.700 --> 02:12:48.700]  And what I don't understand is why the American people aren't getting upset. It seems like
[02:12:48.700 --> 02:12:52.860]  no matter what Obama does, he says he has to read about what he's doing in the paper.
[02:12:52.860 --> 02:12:58.620]  Yeah, Obama is going to be really angry when he finds out what the President did.
[02:13:01.100 --> 02:13:07.020]  Man, that's terrible. But yeah, are you starting to get calls or feedback from your constituents?
[02:13:07.020 --> 02:13:11.020]  What's what's the word? I mean, I know it's only Monday, and this is going to take a while to sink
[02:13:11.020 --> 02:13:17.660]  in. But what's the word from your staff so far on any kind of anger, outbursts about this?
[02:13:17.660 --> 02:13:24.380]  Well, we're getting calls, we're just not what I don't understand from my office. And by the way,
[02:13:24.380 --> 02:13:31.260]  we appreciate those that call us and support us. And because you know, we're up against the big
[02:13:31.260 --> 02:13:37.500]  media and, and others that are in the mainstream. So when they call, we appreciate it. But what I
[02:13:37.500 --> 02:13:44.220]  understand is people outside of your listeners, you interview them or talk to them, it's puzzling
[02:13:44.220 --> 02:13:49.420]  to me at what degree they're willing to give up the individual freedoms for the perception
[02:13:49.420 --> 02:13:54.540]  of security. And we both know that you give up your individual liberties, you soon have neither.
[02:13:55.340 --> 02:14:03.900]  Exactly right. Now, your tweets are also really part of a pattern of liberty that comes out of
[02:14:03.900 --> 02:14:09.820]  Texas, seems like more than any other states. I mean, Texas is where Ron Paul came from. And then,
[02:14:09.820 --> 02:14:15.100]  you know, Rand Paul in Kentucky now, but of course, from Texas, and you're here in Texas,
[02:14:15.100 --> 02:14:21.500]  there are many other liberty lovers in Texas. Is, is Texas really sort of the the headquarters
[02:14:21.500 --> 02:14:27.820]  of liberty for America now? It's becoming a last fashion apparently, New Hampshire used to be that
[02:14:27.820 --> 02:14:33.020]  way. But it seems like everybody from Massachusetts moved there. And they love the freedom in New
[02:14:33.020 --> 02:14:40.220]  Hampshire, they immediately voted in people that hated freedom. So it's kind of odd. You know, in my district alone,
[02:14:40.220 --> 02:14:46.780]  we've had since my election in November, we've had 30,000 new people come in here because of the
[02:14:46.780 --> 02:14:52.940]  ability to get jobs and to operate without as much government. There's still too much government
[02:14:52.940 --> 02:14:58.940]  intrusion, but at least in Texas, we have, as you know, I guess you're in Austin, but you know, we
[02:14:58.940 --> 02:15:04.700]  have less intrusion, although the Obama administration came down here to praise the jobs,
[02:15:04.700 --> 02:15:10.060]  but immediately is implementing more restrictions on those companies that are trying to create jobs.
[02:15:10.060 --> 02:15:16.460]  So that was funny. I think if when Obama comes to Texas, he should stop talking and start listening
[02:15:16.460 --> 02:15:21.580]  because Texas has got the the economy figured out. It's got liberty figured out a little
[02:15:21.580 --> 02:15:27.100]  at least a lot better than the feds. Yeah, I was laughing at Olivia in NPR the other day. She was
[02:15:27.100 --> 02:15:35.580]  commenting, she's saying, these extreme white states such as Texas have unfortunately got lucky
[02:15:35.580 --> 02:15:41.180]  and they're now their economy is doing better. Well, if you're listening to do with the extreme
[02:15:41.180 --> 02:15:45.500]  quote unquote, extreme right policies that had to do with luck. But see, that's just a language
[02:15:45.500 --> 02:15:51.260]  trick to call freedom to call liberty to call the Constitution extreme. You know, that's a classic
[02:15:51.260 --> 02:15:56.940]  liberal leftist trick that they play on NPR as they're trying to hypnotize you, by the way,
[02:15:56.940 --> 02:16:01.740]  thank you for listening to NPR. By the way, do it with your tax dollars. Well, of course. Yeah,
[02:16:01.740 --> 02:16:06.060]  of course. We have to subsidize everything that's evil from the federal government. I'm amazing
[02:16:06.060 --> 02:16:12.300]  that the people are shocked that government radio would want more government. Exactly,
[02:16:12.940 --> 02:16:18.060]  exactly. So about your tweets, though, these are so funny. They're really funny and insightful.
[02:16:18.060 --> 02:16:23.660]  How do you come up with these tweets like this one? The Democrats defending IRS abuses and
[02:16:23.660 --> 02:16:28.220]  illegal spying programs are the same one who insists they would never abuse a gun registry
[02:16:28.220 --> 02:16:36.060]  database. Yeah, well, I think it's, you know, our friends that do the cartoon, I just went blank.
[02:16:37.260 --> 02:16:42.380]  What's the one that they did? They attack liberals and they asked, I said,
[02:16:42.380 --> 02:16:46.780]  why do you attack liberals instead of conservatives? Well, conservatives are used to being
[02:16:47.340 --> 02:16:53.260]  attacked, but if you make fun of a liberal, they just go nuts. We created a bumper sticker,
[02:16:53.260 --> 02:16:59.340]  which we've actually had during the campaign. It said if babies had guns, it wouldn't be aborted.
[02:17:00.380 --> 02:17:05.740]  And that just drove them nuts. So anything we can do to strike the humor and really
[02:17:05.740 --> 02:17:12.220]  their positions are quite humorous. If you look at their ideology, it's easy to make fun of.
[02:17:12.220 --> 02:17:18.380]  Well, it is funny. We ran a story at Natural News, my website last week, about Pink Pistols.
[02:17:18.380 --> 02:17:24.700]  It's a nonprofit group that teaches gays and lesbians how to shoot for self-defense.
[02:17:24.700 --> 02:17:29.980]  And the story just confused people. They didn't know what to attack. It was like,
[02:17:31.260 --> 02:17:34.700]  you know, some of the people were like, I'm against guns, but I support gays. I can't attack
[02:17:34.700 --> 02:17:39.820]  the story. It's like no one could attack the story because it was crossing those two issues
[02:17:39.820 --> 02:17:44.300]  together in a way that doesn't normally happen. People went ballistic with rape victims in the
[02:17:44.300 --> 02:17:50.540]  Huffington Post went off on us saying, you know, how can you say that? That's just quite easy.
[02:17:51.500 --> 02:17:56.700]  We want rape victims that have guns. Yeah, exactly. But then maybe they won't get raped.
[02:17:56.700 --> 02:18:00.300]  Yeah, actually we want all women to have guns. And somebody said, well,
[02:18:00.300 --> 02:18:03.740]  you know, women don't know how to shoot guns. They said, well, in Texas, all women do. They'll
[02:18:03.740 --> 02:18:08.940]  teach them. Oh, heck, at the ranges I've seen women, women are very competent with guns and
[02:18:08.940 --> 02:18:15.180]  rifles and shotguns as well. Let me read another one of your tweets. Obama is collecting private
[02:18:15.180 --> 02:18:20.940]  information on every American, but says it's wrong to make someone show an ID to vote. So true.
[02:18:22.700 --> 02:18:27.260]  Yeah, there was another one we talked about, which was kind of funny.
[02:18:28.300 --> 02:18:31.980]  You know, honest to God, I really did call, just ask Obama.
[02:18:31.980 --> 02:18:40.700]  Exactly. The other one, you know, I don't know if you remember, of course you're aware of this,
[02:18:40.700 --> 02:18:44.780]  but the head of the IRS was in the White House more than anybody else. Of course,
[02:18:44.780 --> 02:18:47.580]  Obama and them never talked about this during the campaign, I'm sure.
[02:18:48.620 --> 02:18:54.860]  He was in the White House 157 times. And of course, Obama had written a paper about him
[02:18:54.860 --> 02:19:02.140]  showing up 157 times. And we were talking, laughing that he didn't know that this guy
[02:19:02.140 --> 02:19:05.820]  was in the White House 157 times, but he knows that you ordered Domino's.
[02:19:07.820 --> 02:19:12.380]  Exactly. It's so true. He seems to have no clue what's going on right around him. But then the
[02:19:12.380 --> 02:19:16.620]  government's keeping tabs on all the details of your private life. But any final thoughts? We're
[02:19:16.620 --> 02:19:19.980]  about to wrap this up, Congressman. Any final thoughts to leave us with here?
[02:19:19.980 --> 02:19:25.260]  Well, like I said, I appreciate the people that follow us. And as you know, we're giving away
[02:19:25.260 --> 02:19:32.380]  AR-15, which is also driving people nuts. And if you go to our website, you know, you can pick up
[02:19:32.380 --> 02:19:38.220]  register for free AR-15. Well, that's fantastic. Just make sure you give away enough ammo because
[02:19:38.220 --> 02:19:42.540]  people can't find that 223 these days. That's the next thing we're going to do.
[02:19:42.540 --> 02:19:46.780]  Yeah. Give them a couple of 30 round clips and say, welcome to Texas.
[02:19:46.780 --> 02:19:51.180]  Yep. All right. Well, thank you, Congressman Stockman. It's a pleasure to have you on.
[02:19:51.180 --> 02:19:55.020]  Thanks so much. You have a great day and appreciate you taking the time to talk to us.
[02:19:55.020 --> 02:19:59.020]  All right. You too. This is the Alex Jones show. Stay with us, folks. We'll be right back. A lot

[02:20:39.820 --> 02:20:44.060]  capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a
[02:20:44.060 --> 02:20:48.140]  greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army. Hi, Ted Anderson. I'm placing a

[02:22:22.300 --> 02:22:30.540]  silver soaps. Just released is our 100% natural silver gel. Our new silver gel is not based on
[02:22:30.540 --> 02:22:36.300]  synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface. But rather,
[02:22:36.300 --> 02:22:41.740]  we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera
[02:22:41.740 --> 02:22:46.700]  to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more effectively.

[02:24:08.300 --> 02:24:12.540]  All right, we're going to return to phone calls here in just a minute on the Alex Jones show
[02:24:12.540 --> 02:24:18.940]  This is Mike Adams filling in for Alex today. Thank you for all your very insightful phone
[02:24:18.940 --> 02:24:26.140]  calls today so far. And the number to call in if you'd like to call in is 1-800-259-9231. Again,
[02:24:26.140 --> 02:24:35.740]  800-259-9231. And I gotta say, what I am really struck by in all of this is just how insane the
[02:24:35.740 --> 02:24:44.940]  media is to say, don't listen to Alex Jones. I mean, Alex Jones has been right on so many things
[02:24:44.940 --> 02:24:50.780]  for so long, and he's been called a conspiracy theorist for so long on all the things that are
[02:24:50.780 --> 02:24:57.580]  now coming out and verified as true, that frankly, the mainstream media owes Alex Jones a massive
[02:24:57.580 --> 02:25:05.580]  apology. A massive apology. So all of the reporters out there in the mainstream media
[02:25:05.580 --> 02:25:09.980]  who have made fun of Alex, and they called him a conspiracy theorist, and they called him a kook,
[02:25:11.100 --> 02:25:19.180]  or whatever terms they use that are derogatory, they need to apologize now. It's all coming out.
[02:25:19.180 --> 02:25:26.060]  The NSA spy grid is coming out. We are under assault. We are being spied on by our own
[02:25:26.060 --> 02:25:33.660]  government. And the media needs to stop with the nonsense. I'm surprised, I'm surprised that they
[02:25:33.660 --> 02:25:39.980]  don't even have, they should have like a Broadway special called Don't Listen to Alex Jones.
[02:25:39.980 --> 02:25:46.700]  It would go something like, don't listen to Alex Jones. Don't listen to Alex Jones.
[02:25:46.700 --> 02:25:51.580]  No one is tapping your phones. No one is searching your homes. Like in Boston,
[02:25:51.580 --> 02:25:57.740]  don't listen to Alex Jones. Don't listen to Alex Jones. Fluoride is good for your bones.
[02:25:57.740 --> 02:26:04.780]  There are no government drones. Just listen to NPR because they never go too far.
[02:26:05.420 --> 02:26:13.500]  Just listen to MSNBC and give them an audience of three. Don't listen, don't listen, don't listen,
[02:26:13.500 --> 02:26:18.540]  don't listen, don't listen to Alex Jones. Don't listen, don't listen, don't listen, don't listen,
[02:26:18.540 --> 02:26:24.220]  because he's always right. Yeah, I've had way too much chocolate today. Sorry about that.
[02:26:27.020 --> 02:26:31.260]  That's my singing debut on the Alex Jones show. You'll probably never see me again.
[02:26:32.940 --> 02:26:37.900]  Like, no more of that. Get the health ranger, get them off of there. Oh my God, he's turning
[02:26:37.900 --> 02:26:43.820]  the show into opera. Something's gone wrong. Get Alex back here. Thank God he's on an airplane
[02:26:43.820 --> 02:26:49.100]  right now, or he'd be calling in right this minute. All right, let's go to call Scott in Idaho.
[02:26:49.100 --> 02:26:53.420]  Scott, you're on the air with apparently an insane health ranger. Go ahead, Scott.
[02:26:54.780 --> 02:26:57.580]  I think you have a fine voice, Michael. Well, thank you.
[02:26:59.500 --> 02:27:04.300]  I believe it was Benjamin Franklin that told us that a nation of well-informed men
[02:27:04.300 --> 02:27:10.060]  who have been taught to know and prize the rights which God has given them cannot be enslaved.
[02:27:10.060 --> 02:27:17.660]  It is in the region of ignorance that tyranny begins. I've had a website since about 1995 where
[02:27:17.660 --> 02:27:23.980]  I've taught people exactly what their rights are and what are the meanings of some of the words
[02:27:23.980 --> 02:27:31.020]  that we throw around so carelessly, like liberty, freedom, and justice. I've spent probably the last
[02:27:31.020 --> 02:27:36.380]  20 years trying to define these words for myself. Excellent. Go ahead. Plug the website. What's the
[02:27:36.380 --> 02:27:43.020]  site? The website, you can find it on Google or Start page. Just type in jailhouse lawyer
[02:27:43.980 --> 02:27:50.620]  and the word angel fire. I'm the jailhouse lawyer and I'm on the angel fire domain.
[02:27:50.620 --> 02:27:55.500]  I've got a legal research engine there where people can do their own legal research,
[02:27:56.140 --> 02:28:02.140]  be their own lawyer. Many people aren't aware that at the turn of the century, most people
[02:28:02.140 --> 02:28:08.540]  were either their own lawyer or they got somebody that could talk before them in court. That was
[02:28:08.540 --> 02:28:14.300]  before the American Bar Association got a monopoly on who can practice law in the court.
[02:28:15.420 --> 02:28:20.540]  Let me ask you about the word freedom because freedom is always abused. Obama says freedom is
[02:28:20.540 --> 02:28:25.020]  being spied on. That's freedom. Can you talk for a minute about the abuse of the word freedom?
[02:28:25.020 --> 02:28:34.540]  Sure. Freedom, like other rights that were granted to us, not by the Constitution or the Bill of
[02:28:34.540 --> 02:28:41.180]  Rights, were granted to us by God previous to government. Those are the rights that we need
[02:28:41.180 --> 02:28:47.500]  to learn and cherish because rights are property. When they steal your rights, they're stealing your
[02:28:47.500 --> 02:28:55.180]  property. This is the mindset that our founding fathers had, that rights are property. But the
[02:28:55.180 --> 02:29:03.260]  Supreme Court of the United States has told us in one of its nefarious decisions that any rights not
[02:29:03.260 --> 02:29:10.060]  timely demanded in the courts are deemed to be waived. What I tell people is if you're not in
[02:29:10.060 --> 02:29:15.740]  court demanding your rights, you're waiving your rights and if you don't know what your rights are,
[02:29:15.740 --> 02:29:21.020]  you don't have any. You nailed it. You nailed it. Exactly. Because people walk in and they don't
[02:29:21.020 --> 02:29:26.540]  realize they're walking into a trap, a legal trap. So I appreciate your calling. I hope people check
[02:29:26.540 --> 02:29:35.020]  out your website there on Angel Fire. And we'll be back with more phone calls. 800-259-9231. We'll
[02:29:35.020 --> 02:29:43.660]  be right back with more of your calls. Don't listen to Alex Jones. Don't listen to Alex Jones.
[02:29:43.660 --> 02:29:49.420]  No one is tapping your phones. No one is searching your homes. No way. Don't listen to Alex Jones.
[02:29:49.420 --> 02:29:56.940]  Don't listen to... We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[02:30:01.260 --> 02:30:06.860]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food and firearms. But if you don't have a home security system,

[02:31:30.860 --> 02:31:36.540]  in 50 years, and the mandated ethanol production has dried up the feed supply for livestock.

[02:33:06.380 --> 02:33:17.420]  All right, there are a bunch of petitions that you need to be aware of. One petition seeks a White
[02:33:17.420 --> 02:33:24.780]  House pardon for the whistleblower, Edward Snowden, so search for that on the start page, of course.
[02:33:24.780 --> 02:33:29.820]  Petitions seeks White House pardon for Snowden so far. Well, the petition says, let me just read
[02:33:29.820 --> 02:33:37.020]  this. If you believe in NSA surveillance, we challenge you to a live public debate with Edward
[02:33:37.020 --> 02:33:44.140]  Snowden. That would be funny. Let's have the constitutional scholar Obama debating the NSA
[02:33:44.140 --> 02:33:49.420]  senior intelligence analyst whistleblower Snowden. Man, I'd paid money to see that.
[02:33:49.420 --> 02:33:54.780]  To get a front row seat for that, I'd pay good money. So far, we don't have very many signatures
[02:33:54.780 --> 02:33:58.860]  because it was just launched. So add some signatures, we need 100,000, and then the White
[02:33:58.860 --> 02:34:05.100]  House will respond to that. Also, wait a minute, I think there's 20,000. I'm mixing up, there's
[02:34:05.100 --> 02:34:11.180]  several petitions. All right, so there are 20,000 signatures on the petition to pardon Snowden,
[02:34:11.180 --> 02:34:18.460]  21,000. And then another petition is to have Obama debate Edward Snowden. And then finally,
[02:34:18.460 --> 02:34:25.980]  we've also got the Infowars petition, demand that Obama resign. And how many signatures do we have
[02:34:25.980 --> 02:34:32.700]  on that petition, guys, so far? You can find that at infowars.com or just search for the White House
[02:34:32.700 --> 02:34:39.820]  petition to demand that Obama resign. Save us the trouble of going through an impeachment process
[02:34:40.620 --> 02:34:46.620]  is the description. And that's a story by Paul Joseph Watson that's got 13,000 signatures so far.
[02:34:46.620 --> 02:34:51.820]  And I'm sure it's rising quickly because that's also a very new petition. Sign these petitions.
[02:34:51.820 --> 02:34:58.540]  It's one way that you can make an impact on all of this. Now, we're gonna go, before we go back
[02:34:58.540 --> 02:35:05.340]  to your phone calls, and thank you for holding, whoa, Ship, Linda, Mike, Tom, and others. We're
[02:35:05.340 --> 02:35:12.700]  gonna go to a video from Fox News featuring Judge Napolitano and his comments on why the Fourth
[02:35:12.700 --> 02:35:16.780]  Amendment actually matters. Let's take a look at that. First, though, let's take this new matter
[02:35:16.780 --> 02:35:21.100]  to the judge, Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano. Harry Reid says,
[02:35:21.100 --> 02:35:25.980]  we should just calm down, Judge. This has been going on a long time. They've been able to stop
[02:35:25.980 --> 02:35:30.700]  some sort of terrorism, this, that, or the other thing. So just don't worry about it. Just relax,
[02:35:30.700 --> 02:35:39.660]  everybody. First, though, let's take this new matter to the judge, Fox News Senior Judicial
[02:35:39.660 --> 02:35:44.620]  Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano. Harry Reid says, we should just calm down, Judge. This has been
[02:35:44.620 --> 02:35:49.020]  going on a long time. They've been able to stop some sort of terrorism, this, that, or the other
[02:35:49.020 --> 02:35:54.700]  thing. So just don't worry about it. Just relax, everybody. See, the laws are really screwy here,
[02:35:54.700 --> 02:36:00.460]  Ship. The laws allow the executive branch, the president and his agents, to tell select members
[02:36:00.460 --> 02:36:05.500]  of Congress when they are doing things like that, but prohibits those members of Congress from
[02:36:05.500 --> 02:36:09.820]  telling the other members of Congress or the American people. Just because Harry Reid knew
[02:36:09.820 --> 02:36:14.540]  about this for seven years and it's been going on for seven years does not mean that it is
[02:36:14.540 --> 02:36:20.140]  constitutionally permissible. This is a fishing expedition on the grandest scale we've ever seen
[02:36:20.140 --> 02:36:25.020]  in American history. They are looking for a select group of people and in order to find that select
[02:36:25.020 --> 02:36:29.580]  group of people, the Constitution says, present some evidence against them to a judge and you'll
[02:36:29.580 --> 02:36:35.900]  get a search warrant for their phones. Rather than doing that, they got a search warrant for 113
[02:36:35.900 --> 02:36:40.060]  million phones. That we know of. That we know of. And they said to us, you know, don't worry.
[02:36:40.060 --> 02:36:43.980]  It's fine. Trust us. We're not listening to the calls. We're just keeping records of them.
[02:36:43.980 --> 02:36:48.860]  Who would trust them after this? The Constitution doesn't trust them. As Catherine Harris just
[02:36:48.860 --> 02:36:53.660]  pointed out, they lied under oath this administration when they were asked under
[02:36:53.660 --> 02:36:59.820]  oath. Are you collecting information about American citizens? That's the point is who
[02:36:59.820 --> 02:37:05.020]  would trust the NSA at this point? How can you ever trust them? And also, how can you ever trust
[02:37:05.020 --> 02:37:12.940]  these technology companies? They lied to you, OK? Google, Facebook, AOL, Apple, they lied to you
[02:37:12.940 --> 02:37:18.380]  when they said that there are no back doors. We've seen the prism slide. There is a back door,
[02:37:18.380 --> 02:37:23.740]  direct server access to all these tech companies. They've been lying to their users for years.
[02:37:23.740 --> 02:37:28.140]  We've got the timeline. We know what year they started the connection. Where does it end?
[02:37:28.780 --> 02:37:34.620]  Probably never ends unless we somehow stand up to it. And if we don't, they're gonna end up
[02:37:34.620 --> 02:37:40.300]  reading our thoughts, OK? And throwing us in jail for thought crimes. And you know,
[02:37:40.300 --> 02:37:45.420]  all of us here at Info Wars are, of course, guilty of thought crimes because we actually can think.
[02:37:46.140 --> 02:37:53.900]  So that right there makes you a threat, a terrorist for having skeptical thoughts
[02:37:54.460 --> 02:37:58.860]  about the fake news that we're all being told by the mainstream media. Let's go to some more
[02:37:58.860 --> 02:38:03.660]  calls because we're getting such great calls today. Let's see if we can get a crazy call here
[02:38:03.660 --> 02:38:09.180]  at some point. But let's go to Ship in San Antonio. Doesn't sound crazy. Ship, you're on the air. Are
[02:38:09.180 --> 02:38:15.580]  you crazy or or do you love to be spied on? What's the deal? Oh, man, I hate being spied on, dude.
[02:38:16.460 --> 02:38:22.540]  And it seems like they just more and more spy on us. Yeah, that's that's their goal.
[02:38:22.540 --> 02:38:27.100]  That's their system. And oh, and you're paying for it, Chip. Your tax dollars are paying for
[02:38:27.100 --> 02:38:32.460]  you to be spied on. How do you like that? It's pretty typical. I mean, that just
[02:38:32.460 --> 02:38:35.980]  goes along with the whole agenda that they push on us every day.
[02:38:35.980 --> 02:38:39.420]  Well, what do you think we should do about it? Yeah, go ahead.
[02:38:40.220 --> 02:38:45.420]  Oh, no, it's cool. I live here in San Antonio, you know, and I have a bunch of friends that are,
[02:38:45.420 --> 02:38:51.900]  you know, ex-military and a bunch of the alphabet games and stuff. And they have, you know, kind of
[02:38:51.900 --> 02:38:58.780]  give me info here and there. And basically there are, you know, hubs here in San Antonio that are
[02:38:58.780 --> 02:39:04.220]  spy stations, dude, like they listen to your calls. They do everything. It's a data mining
[02:39:04.220 --> 02:39:10.620]  center. There's not just one. There's quite a bit like the one I know for sure is old Kmart.
[02:39:10.620 --> 02:39:17.100]  That's to the magnitude of how big it is. The blue light special surveillance grid.
[02:39:17.100 --> 02:39:21.980]  No kidding, right? Yeah. So what do your friends say they want to do about it? Are
[02:39:21.980 --> 02:39:25.580]  they just going to sit back and let it let the NSA roll over them or what?
[02:39:26.380 --> 02:39:32.220]  Well, it's not like I mean, I'm one of a few, you know, my brother in law is really big into it,
[02:39:32.220 --> 02:39:37.420]  like feels the same way I do. But, you know, it's kind of hard to push and not push,
[02:39:37.420 --> 02:39:41.820]  just like open the ears to people that, you know, don't want to hear it. You know,
[02:39:41.820 --> 02:39:44.220]  you kind of kind of gradually ease them into it.
[02:39:45.500 --> 02:39:48.060]  Like at first you tell them their emails are being read.
[02:39:49.020 --> 02:39:53.500]  And then it's frustrating because you want somebody to be like, you know,
[02:39:53.500 --> 02:39:58.700]  take the bull by the horns, you know, and they are just so naive and weak to say,
[02:39:58.700 --> 02:40:04.540]  you know, whatever, this is the way it is. And I'm like, dude, you can't you can't be like that,
[02:40:04.540 --> 02:40:10.380]  man. You've got to really get out there and and say, you know what? Enough is enough to do. And
[02:40:10.380 --> 02:40:12.060]  they're like, well, where do I start? What do I do?
[02:40:13.420 --> 02:40:18.940]  They trust the Obama government. They trust Obama. See, they wouldn't trust a Republican
[02:40:18.940 --> 02:40:23.180]  with these powers. No, because that would be bad. And I agree that is bad. But they
[02:40:23.180 --> 02:40:28.700]  trust a Democrat with it because Democrats never do anything evil. Get that straight.
[02:40:28.700 --> 02:40:34.940]  And it's the naivety in this. It can't happen to us. This exceptionalism like,
[02:40:34.940 --> 02:40:37.980]  you know, that, oh, you know, it won't happen to us here, which is
[02:40:38.700 --> 02:40:44.700]  a crock. And it's a shame that people don't see that, you know, it can happen anywhere.
[02:40:44.700 --> 02:40:48.860]  It's not just saying, oh, this could happen somewhere else or a foreign country.
[02:40:48.860 --> 02:40:56.060]  Like, why are we so exempt? Why are we so special? We are not. We are humans and people just as
[02:40:56.060 --> 02:41:02.380]  everywhere else. Well, in fact, it's so bad that the whistleblower fled to China to tell the truth
[02:41:02.380 --> 02:41:07.740]  about America. I mean, it's like it's like fleeing to North Korea and saying Kim Jong Un, you know,
[02:41:07.740 --> 02:41:15.340]  give me freedom. That's how bad it's gotten in America. It's just crazy. And it's like,
[02:41:15.340 --> 02:41:20.780]  where where do they where do we cross that line to say, you know what? And nothing's enough,
[02:41:20.780 --> 02:41:24.780]  like Adam Kokesh and stuff. I was totally for that. But at the same time, it's like,
[02:41:25.420 --> 02:41:29.820]  man, that's that's a thin blue line to where you've got to say, man, what could they stage
[02:41:29.820 --> 02:41:35.260]  something like that, even though a peaceful protest should be that of the people?
[02:41:35.260 --> 02:41:40.940]  And it's like we have gotten so far away from our forefathers that they are rolling in their graves.
[02:41:40.940 --> 02:41:44.940]  Well, it's clear this is never going to be stopped by a bunch of peaceful protests. I mean,
[02:41:44.940 --> 02:41:48.620]  I'm not I'm not calling for violence, but peaceful protests are going to go nowhere because
[02:41:49.340 --> 02:41:52.940]  they're just going to keep lying to us, basically. Exactly. And it's like,
[02:41:53.820 --> 02:41:58.540]  hey, the peaceful protest isn't enough. And in these in these little, you know,
[02:41:58.540 --> 02:42:02.940]  10 bits of information we're getting that aren't awaking everybody. It's like, what is
[02:42:03.580 --> 02:42:10.220]  what will wake you up, people? Yeah, it's going to have to be like a mass roundup of people,
[02:42:10.220 --> 02:42:13.660]  you know, throwing them into the incinerators. And then, you know, maybe some people wake up.
[02:42:13.660 --> 02:42:18.300]  But great call ship. I really appreciate calling. Good, good conversation there. Let's go to Mike
[02:42:18.300 --> 02:42:22.700]  in Chicago. Mike, you've got comments about false flags. That's what the notes say.
[02:42:24.060 --> 02:42:27.340]  Yeah, yeah. You know, I was I was just kind of looking at some of the stuff going on in
[02:42:27.340 --> 02:42:32.380]  California and it kind of seems kind of odd how some of these people get away with walking around
[02:42:32.380 --> 02:42:36.540]  with what they say that they're carrying. You know, somebody with a vest with multiple clips
[02:42:36.540 --> 02:42:41.420]  and shotguns and assault rifles. How did how did this guy walk around and not get caught by
[02:42:41.420 --> 02:42:46.300]  anybody? You're talking about that shooting. Yeah, yeah. How did how did nobody take this
[02:42:46.300 --> 02:42:51.100]  guy down? Well, I know since people people get the police called on when they're carrying an umbrella
[02:42:51.100 --> 02:42:58.460]  or a water gun or a pop tart. Absolutely. You know, I live in an association, which I think
[02:42:58.460 --> 02:43:03.660]  they're like Nazis, you know, where I live, homeowner Nazis. And I was I was burning one day
[02:43:03.660 --> 02:43:08.940]  some leaves. Next thing I know, I have four police officers at my house for burning leaves. Yeah,
[02:43:08.940 --> 02:43:12.300]  well, that's that's an act of terrorism against the environment there, bud.
[02:43:13.820 --> 02:43:20.220]  I'm telling you. And, you know, I wanted to tell a quick story. I'm in my mid 30s. And when I was
[02:43:20.220 --> 02:43:25.180]  about eight years old, my dad took me to Army Surplus for my birthday.
[02:43:27.740 --> 02:43:36.380]  It's like a kid in a candy store. Well, I got like boots and a little backpack and then they
[02:43:36.380 --> 02:43:40.140]  had like little little training grenades, you know, and they had little holes in the bottom.
[02:43:40.700 --> 02:43:47.820]  Well, I actually brought it to school because we used to play war. And I threw it like, you know,
[02:43:47.820 --> 02:43:52.140]  like a crowd of kids were playing and I knew it was fake then, you know? Well, the next thing I
[02:43:52.140 --> 02:43:57.900]  know, I'm in the office and and all that happened at that time was I went to a Catholic school. All
[02:43:57.900 --> 02:44:03.020]  that happened at that time was my dad got called, my mom got called, you know, my dad whooped my
[02:44:03.020 --> 02:44:08.780]  butt. But now if you did that, even if it was fake, you would be thrown, you'd be thrown in
[02:44:08.780 --> 02:44:13.580]  jail and they'd throw the jail away. Oh, yeah. They would arrest the parents, take the kids.
[02:44:13.580 --> 02:44:18.940]  Yeah. I mean, gee, how dare you have a fake, you know, hand grenade. Unbelievable. You know,
[02:44:18.940 --> 02:44:22.380]  I was eight years old. I knew it was fake, but it was, you know, when you're a kid like that,
[02:44:22.380 --> 02:44:27.740]  it was fun playing war and stuff. Well, nowadays, if you did that, what if you had a little toy
[02:44:27.740 --> 02:44:33.100]  tank, you know, a toy tank? It might be a real one. They can. Absolutely. How dare you bring a
[02:44:33.100 --> 02:44:39.580]  tank to school? Absolutely. And, you know, just, you know, I just wanted to say, you know, that
[02:44:40.380 --> 02:44:45.580]  the times have changed so much now and I'm in my early thirties and I'm looking at going, wow,
[02:44:46.300 --> 02:44:51.180]  I feel like I'm turning into an old man because just stuff is changing so fast and the way kids
[02:44:51.180 --> 02:44:56.460]  are growing up and being, you know, sheepled into the way they got to learn, the way they got to
[02:44:56.460 --> 02:45:00.620]  think and the things they can and can't do. And you can't have a garden. You can't have this.
[02:45:00.620 --> 02:45:04.860]  You can't have that anymore. And it's just America is not America anymore. You're right,
[02:45:04.860 --> 02:45:11.100]  Mike. And now these kids are growing up under the regime of the NSA. So as these kids grow up,
[02:45:11.100 --> 02:45:14.540]  everything is being monitored. Can you imagine when those kids grow up and become,
[02:45:14.540 --> 02:45:20.060]  let's say, congressmen or senators, all the stuff they did as kids being used against them by the
[02:45:20.060 --> 02:45:25.580]  NSA? I mean, imagine that. I mean, come on. We were all, you know, 18 once. Think of the stuff
[02:45:25.580 --> 02:45:29.260]  you did when you were 18. Well, imagine if that was all on the record. Come on.
[02:45:30.700 --> 02:45:38.780]  No, no. So thank you for your time. I just wanted to get that out and I love the show and you guys
[02:45:38.780 --> 02:45:42.380]  are doing an awesome job. Keep it going. Well, good call, Mike. Thank you for your comments.
[02:45:42.380 --> 02:45:47.420]  I really appreciate the callers today. Let's go to another caller. Josh in Utah. Josh,
[02:45:47.420 --> 02:45:53.740]  you're live on national radio. Go ahead, sir. Hey Mike, I think you're doing an awesome job
[02:45:53.740 --> 02:45:58.940]  and I would love to see you have your own show if you choose. Hey, thank you, sir. Well, I've
[02:45:58.940 --> 02:46:04.860]  offered Alex to do a weekly health show, like a health exposed type of show. So as soon as his
[02:46:04.860 --> 02:46:10.780]  new studio is ready, maybe we'll do that. I'd love to do it. That would be great. Also, I thought
[02:46:10.780 --> 02:46:16.700]  this year's Bilderberg coverage was outstanding. It was great to see they actually admit that they
[02:46:16.700 --> 02:46:24.060]  exist. Now, the next step is to actually have them admit what they're actually talking about. Oh,
[02:46:24.060 --> 02:46:29.420]  you mean you're talking about that conference that doesn't exist? Yeah. Yeah, that one. Well,
[02:46:29.420 --> 02:46:32.940]  you notice I didn't talk about it today because I don't talk about things that don't exist.
[02:46:32.940 --> 02:46:38.780]  How dare you call about the B, the B thing, you know, because letters of the alphabet are
[02:46:38.780 --> 02:46:50.780]  thought crimes. You have to talk about something other than B, I'm sorry. Okay, well. Well, we have
[02:46:50.780 --> 02:46:58.780]  to talk about the Ildeburg conference is my point. Ildeburg and the Ildeburgers. It was a great
[02:46:58.780 --> 02:47:05.820]  conference. I thought a lot of things got out there and a lot of things came out and I'm just
[02:47:05.820 --> 02:47:08.940]  happy things are progressing in the right direction. Well, isn't it interesting, though,
[02:47:08.940 --> 02:47:13.580]  Josh, that five years ago, the media pretended that Alex Jones was delusional when he was
[02:47:13.580 --> 02:47:19.660]  reporting about the Ildeburgers. And now they say, oh, it's all real, but it doesn't matter.
[02:47:19.660 --> 02:47:24.060]  It's just a bunch of people meeting about nothing really important. Yeah, we're just they're just
[02:47:24.060 --> 02:47:29.100]  talking about, you know, how to how to how to improve their businesses. They're doing
[02:47:29.100 --> 02:47:32.460]  such a good job. Yeah, yeah. So it's like a country club. They're just shooting pool,
[02:47:32.460 --> 02:47:36.620]  ordering chicken fried steak and having some tea. That's that's the Ildeburg conference. Well,
[02:47:36.620 --> 02:47:41.660]  thank you for your call, Josh. Some good points. Let's go to Dave in Michigan with maybe comments
[02:47:41.660 --> 02:47:46.620]  on the NSA. Dave, you're on the air. Hey, Mike, thanks for taking my call. I just wanted to say
[02:47:47.260 --> 02:47:52.300]  I think Alex did a great job in England and I've really learned a lot from you over the years
[02:47:52.300 --> 02:47:56.940]  sitting in for Alex. And thank you to the last caller about you having your old show. And I'm
[02:47:56.940 --> 02:48:02.700]  just telling you, I'm walking over the window, I'm opening my window, I'm sticking my head out
[02:48:02.700 --> 02:48:11.260]  the window and I'm saying I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to do it anymore. Yeah, man, say it.
[02:48:11.260 --> 02:48:19.740]  I love it. I love your energy. People are off the charts, the news, the media, the, you know,
[02:48:19.740 --> 02:48:27.340]  the government, everybody in the neighbors. And, you know, people are so asleep at the wheel.
[02:48:28.140 --> 02:48:33.420]  It's pathetic. You can't wake anybody up. We've been on young jeopardy for two years.
[02:48:33.420 --> 02:48:42.700]  That stuff is great. I'm legally blind. And I moved from the city to the country on 10 acres
[02:48:42.700 --> 02:48:48.380]  because of Alex Jones. You know, I don't agree with everything he says, but I'm telling you,
[02:48:48.380 --> 02:48:53.900]  he is the best we got. And, you know, you're right up there with them. And I love what you're
[02:48:53.900 --> 02:48:58.860]  teaching us about, you know, our bodies and the environment and, you know, just being the health
[02:48:58.860 --> 02:49:05.020]  ranger and. Well, thank you, Dave. Thank you, Dave. I love your energy and your passion and
[02:49:05.020 --> 02:49:10.780]  you're right. You know, none of us are perfect, but we're the best we got, you know, and it's not
[02:49:10.780 --> 02:49:16.620]  about any person. It's not about Alex or me or any or, you know, Cilenti or anybody. It's not about
[02:49:16.620 --> 02:49:22.860]  any people. It's about how we the people are standing up against this charity and exposing
[02:49:22.860 --> 02:49:27.180]  the charity and telling the truth, even in the face of just incredible lies and deceptions by
[02:49:27.180 --> 02:49:33.020]  the mainstream media. And we won't shut up and we won't put up with it and we won't sit down and
[02:49:33.020 --> 02:49:37.980]  behave. We're going to keep speaking out and fighting back against these injustices. We're
[02:49:37.980 --> 02:49:43.020]  going to keep doing it right here from Infowars.com and all of the alternative media, which is the new
[02:49:43.020 --> 02:49:48.620]  mainstream media. So you're right on. I love your passion and we're with you, man. Thank you. All
[02:49:48.620 --> 02:49:53.900]  right. Thank you for your call, Dave. Let's go to Mark in Philadelphia. Go ahead, Mark. Welcome to
[02:49:53.900 --> 02:50:00.380]  the show. Health ranger. Hey, how are you, sir? I'm doing good today. I'm having a little too much
[02:50:00.380 --> 02:50:05.580]  fun, I've been told. I've got a quick list of items I'd love to hit you with real quick. All
[02:50:05.580 --> 02:50:12.460]  right, go for it. First off, not only does this snooping stifle and eviscerate the Fourth Amendment,
[02:50:12.460 --> 02:50:16.940]  but it clearly stifles the First Amendment because you have people of all kinds of all their
[02:50:16.940 --> 02:50:21.660]  different types of digital communications where they're going to feel like they can't say anything
[02:50:21.660 --> 02:50:26.380]  as if they probably shouldn't have already moving forward because both personal and otherwise,
[02:50:26.380 --> 02:50:30.460]  it's going to be recorded to be used against them as blackmail, ala Jadgar Hoover for the next
[02:50:30.460 --> 02:50:35.820]  decade. Oh, yeah. Second, okay, number one. Secondly, I have not heard anyone talk about the
[02:50:35.820 --> 02:50:43.100]  fact that this massive amount of business espionage that's going to be going on here where,
[02:50:43.100 --> 02:50:47.340]  you know, we're talking about Iran Contra on steroids. Oh, yeah. Hey, Mark, we got to go to
[02:50:47.340 --> 02:50:50.860]  break. Stay on the phone, though. We'll come right back to you after this break and continue with
[02:50:50.860 --> 02:50:55.180]  your points, okay? It's a great call. Stay with us. This is the Alex Jones Show. We'll be right
[02:50:55.180 --> 02:51:02.940]  back after this break with more insanity. You never know. Hi, my name is Stephen Huir. As a
[02:51:02.940 --> 02:51:07.340]  degree nutritionist, my first priority is for you to get healthy. That won't happen if I make
[02:51:07.340 --> 02:51:11.820]  wrong recommendations or cause you to spend money on supplements you don't need. After 20 years
[02:51:11.820 --> 02:51:16.460]  working with thousands of products and thousands of people, I know for the most part what does and
[02:51:16.460 --> 02:51:22.460]  does not work. One World Way is the first and only unheated whey protein powder from grass-fed cows
[02:51:22.460 --> 02:51:28.220]  on the market. It retains substances that no other whey protein powder has. These nutritive compounds
[02:51:28.220 --> 02:51:32.780]  supply life-giving nutrition. Your body merely needs the right conditions to make great health

[02:52:00.300 --> 02:52:08.060]  Hello, this is Steve Schenk. Alex and I want to thank you for the generous support of the Oklahoma
[02:52:08.060 --> 02:52:14.860]  food donations pouring in every day. In just six days, over 37,000 servings have been shipped.

[02:52:22.380 --> 02:52:27.740]  Please keep Oklahoma important, but we've got serious food issues. For example, the rising
[02:52:27.740 --> 02:52:33.980]  cost of food, especially beef, last year's worst drought in 50 years, and the mandated ethanol
[02:52:33.980 --> 02:52:39.420]  production has dried up the feed supply for livestock. Chinese are offering $4.7 billion
[02:52:39.420 --> 02:52:44.700]  to buy our largest pork producer. Find out more and get the one solution you can count on

[02:54:18.780 --> 02:54:23.500]  You never know what you're going to find behind the desk here at the Alex Jones headquarters
[02:54:23.500 --> 02:54:30.780]  and Infowars studio today. I walk in and there's the Infidel body armor just sitting here. Oh my
[02:54:30.780 --> 02:54:37.180]  God, it's heavy too. And I was joking with the guys that we should have a new brand called
[02:54:37.180 --> 02:54:44.860]  Infidel Castro body armor that only stops communist bullets. They thought that's not
[02:54:44.860 --> 02:54:50.780]  even funny. Gone too far. Infidel armor. They're a sponsor of the show now, right?
[02:54:50.780 --> 02:54:57.340]  That's why this armor is here? Or is this Alex's plan? This is his escape plan. He's going to come
[02:54:57.340 --> 02:55:03.740]  back, say something, interview Ed Snowden, and then slap on the body armor and head out of here.
[02:55:03.740 --> 02:55:07.820]  No, I'm sorry. Let's go to calls. Nick in California. You're on the air, Nick. Crazy
[02:55:07.820 --> 02:55:12.540]  subjects. What's on your mind, Nick? There are magnetic strips on the road that
[02:55:12.540 --> 02:55:18.780]  detect its cars just for it gets flowing. Well, the status quo is a collective of information
[02:55:18.780 --> 02:55:23.980]  being sold for personal gain and the use of it for manipulation. And the crazy part is
[02:55:25.100 --> 02:55:31.100]  you're getting your blood and urine samples just for environmental aspects. The chem trials are
[02:55:31.100 --> 02:55:36.540]  going on stealth. You get your grocery cards. They know what you're buying. They'll get somebody
[02:55:36.540 --> 02:55:40.940]  into that company. And I'm afraid to buy bottled water anyway. I have to because-
[02:55:40.940 --> 02:55:43.820]  Wait a minute. I just want to clarify. So you're saying, I mean, they are swabbing
[02:55:43.820 --> 02:55:48.140]  your DNA at police stops and checkpoints now, and they are monitoring your grocery
[02:55:48.140 --> 02:55:51.980]  purchases with your loyalty cards. You're right. And I've had my blood test. I mean,
[02:55:51.980 --> 02:55:56.460]  my urine test just taken and after in a week later there was a door slam and I thought I
[02:55:56.460 --> 02:55:59.500]  was smelling something and things went wrong with me for a while. What? What?
[02:55:59.500 --> 02:56:04.860]  I mean, that's the reality today. All these chemicals and concentrations that can be used.
[02:56:04.860 --> 02:56:08.780]  Well, I don't quite track everything you're saying, but I think you're onto something.
[02:56:08.780 --> 02:56:16.540]  A criminal is a biological corrupt. And if you're in a holy place like the land of Jesus
[02:56:17.100 --> 02:56:19.100]  and they pour something in your-
[02:56:19.100 --> 02:56:25.420]  Okay, man, I'm curious what's in your urine test. Let's go to the next caller, Mike in Wyoming.
[02:56:25.420 --> 02:56:31.820]  Sorry. It just helps to have your thoughts organized. Mike, in Wyoming, you're on the air.
[02:56:31.820 --> 02:56:32.460]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:56:33.020 --> 02:56:37.260]  Yeah. Hi, Mike. I was watching Fox News as I was getting ready for work this morning and
[02:56:37.260 --> 02:56:44.700]  I heard Congressman Kevin McCarthy say some pretty nasty things about
[02:56:47.020 --> 02:56:53.100]  the whistleblower, the younger with Snowden, thank you, who went out to Hong Kong. And then
[02:56:53.100 --> 02:56:58.220]  Stephen King was quoted also as saying that no country should give sanctuary to these guys.
[02:56:58.220 --> 02:57:03.980]  And I would encourage people to call their offices, that is McCarthy and King.
[02:57:05.100 --> 02:57:05.580]  Peter King?
[02:57:05.580 --> 02:57:08.620]  Peter King, thank you.
[02:57:10.220 --> 02:57:12.620]  It is a horror novel that we are reading though, by the way.
[02:57:12.620 --> 02:57:20.940]  Yeah, yeah. A former IRA terrorist, a gun runner. This man should know terrorism when he sees it.
[02:57:21.900 --> 02:57:27.180]  Call their offices and encourage him to impeach Obama rather than trying to discourage
[02:57:27.180 --> 02:57:36.860]  whistleblowers. You were talking about the NSA and how health information is not gonna be safe
[02:57:36.860 --> 02:57:45.580]  anymore. The AIG, the American Insurance Group, which control the majority of medical insurance
[02:57:45.580 --> 02:57:53.420]  in this country until it was bought out basically by the government. I mean, they were run by Morris
[02:57:53.420 --> 02:58:00.540]  Greenberg who was closely attached to the CIA. So I have no doubt that the CIA had access to
[02:58:00.540 --> 02:58:05.500]  medical records for many years during Greenberg's tenure there.
[02:58:05.500 --> 02:58:10.860]  Well, it's pretty clear that we are now living under a spyocracy, maybe combined with an
[02:58:10.860 --> 02:58:15.980]  idiocracy, but definitely a spyocracy component. Well, anyway, I thank you for your call. That's
[02:58:15.980 --> 02:58:20.620]  our last caller. That's our show for today. Thank you for listening or watching on
[02:58:20.620 --> 02:58:25.820]  prisonplanet.tv. Check more news at infowars.com. Thank you to the crew today. You did a great job.
[02:58:25.820 --> 02:58:30.620]  Awesome show. I enjoyed the calls and the production values. This is Mike Adams,
[02:58:30.620 --> 02:58:35.100]  the health ranger, naturalnews.com is my website. And this is infowars.com.
[02:58:35.100 --> 02:58:50.780]  Alex is back tomorrow. I don't know when I'm back, but he'll let me know. Talk to you later.
