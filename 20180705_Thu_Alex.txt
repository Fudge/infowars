[00:00:08.749 --> 00:00:10.050]  Well, here we are.
[00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.751]  July 5th, 2018.
[00:00:11.751 --> 00:00:14.692]  Another epic July 4th has come and gone.
[00:00:14.692 --> 00:00:19.675]  And never has it been more clear where the stakes are for humanity.
[00:00:19.675 --> 00:00:20.976]  But I want to make a point.
[00:00:20.976 --> 00:00:24.018]  There's a Churchill quote, I'm paraphrasing it, that
[00:00:25.347 --> 00:00:27.369]  Many people get hit by history.
[00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:36.057]  They get run over in the street by huge, big, epic developments and they kind of dust themselves off and ignore the point in history that they're in.
[00:00:36.057 --> 00:00:44.125]  But there are other people that get hit by destiny and hit by history and they get up and it changes the course of their lives and countless other people's lives.
[00:00:45.566 --> 00:01:00.602]  And so I want people to remember that the hundreds of millions that died under communism and the tens of millions that died under fascism and other cults and permutations of governmental control and societal mental illness manifest by government debt
[00:01:01.886 --> 00:01:05.908]  We are on the precipice of a new global revolution, a new renaissance.
[00:01:05.908 --> 00:01:12.691]  And we're actually, because of other people's work before us, shitting on a great brain trust of human liberty.
[00:01:12.691 --> 00:01:20.114]  And that we've got a chance to fight for freedom when the odds are actually on our side, if we realize it.
[00:01:20.114 --> 00:01:22.756]  We've got to look back on those that didn't have a chance to win.
[00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:33.454]  But took action and did what was right because it was about their soul and about the spiritual, cultural, human decision they were making.
[00:01:33.454 --> 00:01:35.735]  And that's why they were fulfilled.
[00:01:35.735 --> 00:01:38.738]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:01:38.738 --> 00:01:40.199]  I want to thank you all for your prayers.
[00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:45.063]  I want to thank you all for what you've done against the bullies and the peer pressure over the years.
[00:01:45.063 --> 00:01:51.728]  Because if it wasn't for you, and if it wasn't for everything you've done, we wouldn't be here.
[00:01:53.277 --> 00:01:57.624]  Many of those people aren't here today that stood up for what was right.
[00:01:59.602 --> 00:02:05.907]  But in their gut, they believed in you, and they believed in me, and they believed that we could build a better future.
[00:02:05.907 --> 00:02:07.649]  They had goodwill towards people.
[00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.873]  They didn't want to use the fact that they had more knowledge than the average person to control that person.
[00:02:12.873 --> 00:02:19.138]  They didn't want to use the fact that they understood how the game was played to then set up a little secret cabal and feed on people.
[00:02:19.138 --> 00:02:27.945]  They had the true vision of human empowerment and the true mastery to empower others and bring them to the next level.
[00:02:27.945 --> 00:02:28.746]  They were Christ-like.
[00:02:29.696 --> 00:02:29.936]  I think
[00:02:47.828 --> 00:02:50.309]  And your awakening and the decisions you've made.
[00:02:50.309 --> 00:03:10.176]  So, I just want to tell you as we've passed through this July 4th, 2018, as the globalists launch their riots and their attacks and their lies and their moralizing that have good cheer, my friends, because we're living in a time and age when the devil knows the time is short, so he sends the beast with wrath.
[00:03:10.176 --> 00:03:12.817]  And there are whole world government systems here, the mark of the beast.
[00:03:12.817 --> 00:03:15.158]  It's going to be a lot of trials, a lot of tribulations, but
[00:03:16.288 --> 00:03:20.590]  We know the truth and we know who wins and we know where this all goes.
[00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:28.733]  And so that's a very positive fact to understand.
[00:03:28.733 --> 00:03:32.094]  All that matters is what you stand for.
[00:03:32.094 --> 00:03:36.996]  All that matters is not being a coward and not feeding on people that aren't as smart as you.
[00:03:36.996 --> 00:03:38.497]  And the minute you realize that,
[00:03:39.582 --> 00:03:51.731]  You're in God's arms forever, and these Satanists, and these Crowleyites, and these Democrats, and these Chi-Coms, and all these control freaks who want to control reality, who want to try to become a God, because they merge with AI technology.
[00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:54.833]  They don't understand they already had a connection to God.
[00:03:54.833 --> 00:03:57.915]  They were already an expression of God's consciousness in the universe.
[00:03:57.915 --> 00:04:00.857]  There was no need to ever even do that.
[00:04:00.857 --> 00:04:02.598]  But that's why we have free will.
[00:04:02.598 --> 00:04:06.201]  Some people will fall to the lower dimension.
[00:04:06.201 --> 00:04:08.743]  Some people will rise and ascend towards
[00:04:10.007 --> 00:04:13.108]  A communion and a reunification with Christ.
[00:04:13.108 --> 00:04:14.929]  And that's the big choice.
[00:04:14.929 --> 00:04:17.369]  And that's why I know you've made the right choice.
[00:04:17.369 --> 00:04:19.490]  You're not going to find Christ in these whorehouse churches.
[00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:25.572]  That's where the literal globalists run the operation via the World Council of Churches.
[00:04:25.572 --> 00:04:31.054]  But you're going to find the real Christ in your heart, seeking after God and saying, I want to be a good person.
[00:04:31.054 --> 00:04:32.314]  I want to be just.
[00:04:32.314 --> 00:04:33.174]  I want to be honorable.
[00:04:33.174 --> 00:04:34.475]  I'm going to tell the truth.
[00:04:34.475 --> 00:04:38.356]  So again, are those of us here, when we're seeing this great awakening of heroes,
[00:04:39.184 --> 00:04:39.844]  No.
[00:04:39.844 --> 00:04:51.331]  The heroes are those in communist China and North Korea and old Soviet Russia and countless other places like Cuba that were tortured and murdered and killed and watched their children go to prison because they didn't deny God the truth.
[00:04:51.331 --> 00:04:56.615]  And to them on this July 4th, I want to thank you all and thank you for 1776 Worldwide.
[00:04:56.615 --> 00:04:57.295]  God bless you all.

[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.161]  The Empire is on the run.
[00:06:03.161 --> 00:06:04.882]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:06:33.673 --> 00:06:34.774]  Life is coming back.
[00:06:34.774 --> 00:06:35.895]  Humanity is coming back.
[00:06:35.895 --> 00:06:38.356]  Nationalism is coming back.
[00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:41.599]  Humanity is awakening.
[00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:43.780]  The ace of spades, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:43.780 --> 00:07:00.112]  July 4th, 2018 will be the demarcation line of the launch of the new renaissance and the true new American century and the beginning of the end of the globalist as humanity prepares to face the next level of challenges.
[00:07:01.499 --> 00:07:06.705]  We are surpassing the globalists at this point at every level, but they are in their death throes.
[00:07:06.705 --> 00:07:12.592]  They are striking back with everything they've got.
[00:07:12.592 --> 00:07:16.937]  We have incredible news coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:07:16.937 --> 00:07:20.701]  NBC's Chuck Todd admits President Trump winning.
[00:07:20.701 --> 00:07:22.263]  Democrats reeling.
[00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.019]  Isn't that amazing?
[00:07:26.019 --> 00:07:36.484]  Progressives scramble to block potential Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett because she is a committed Christian.
[00:07:36.484 --> 00:07:45.669]  The man who threatened to murder Rand Paul's children to gut them and smear their intestines everywhere is an Obama-supporting Berkeley resident.
[00:07:45.669 --> 00:07:50.892]  Of course he is, and now he's facing 10 years in prison with his ironic glasses.
[00:07:56.288 --> 00:07:59.549]  We've got so much to break down here.
[00:07:59.549 --> 00:08:04.190]  We've got Brian Ross is leaving ABC News after botched Michael Flynn report.
[00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:10.432]  You know where he lied and said, Flynn admits he's a Russian agent, and it's all coming out, and he told Mueller that Trump is a Russian agent.
[00:08:10.432 --> 00:08:11.012]  Total hoax!
[00:08:11.012 --> 00:08:12.692]  You know, Joy Behar, just got the news!
[00:08:12.692 --> 00:08:13.393]  Yay!
[00:08:13.393 --> 00:08:14.253]  Trump's a Russian agent!
[00:08:14.253 --> 00:08:15.013]  Total proof!
[00:08:15.013 --> 00:08:15.993]  Ah!
[00:08:15.993 --> 00:08:17.173]  Tom Arnold, oh!
[00:08:17.173 --> 00:08:18.834]  His lawyer admits they're Russian agents!
[00:08:18.834 --> 00:08:19.774]  I'm gonna have him on!
[00:08:19.774 --> 00:08:20.774]  Total lie!
[00:08:20.774 --> 00:08:22.635]  Hoaxing, hoaxing, hoaxing by the hoaxers.
[00:08:23.949 --> 00:08:28.751]  Otto warns that the existence of the UN, EU, and NATO, that means world government, are threatened.
[00:08:28.751 --> 00:08:33.013]  That's AP.
[00:08:33.013 --> 00:08:37.836]  We got all these Republicans and Trump officials being harassed everywhere.
[00:08:37.836 --> 00:08:43.258]  Scott Pruitt becomes the latest official to be harassed at the head of the EPA at a restaurant.
[00:08:43.258 --> 00:08:44.119]  It's all coming out.
[00:08:44.119 --> 00:08:49.581]  Oh, and there's a secret Roe v. Wade film filming right now with a lot of top stars shooting in New Orleans.
[00:08:49.581 --> 00:08:50.782]  I hadn't heard anything about that.
[00:08:52.256 --> 00:09:11.680]  So we're going to be getting into all of those corollary issues, but let me, ladies and gentlemen, let me give you the biggest news concerning the fight with the deep state that I have covered in a long, long time.
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:19.301]  I've got a lot of good contacts inside Trump world at the highest levels and
[00:09:20.856 --> 00:09:28.980]  Now that Kelly is receding towards being put out to pasture, those contacts have been heating up and have been particularly revealing.
[00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:39.126]  So let me give you bombshell first look information with myself and Roger Stone right now.
[00:09:39.126 --> 00:09:41.287]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:09:41.287 --> 00:09:42.588]  It's on Newswars.com.
[00:09:42.588 --> 00:09:44.989]  I've tweeted it out as well.
[00:09:44.989 --> 00:09:46.990]  It's a Paul Joseph Watson story.
[00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:50.252]  I relayed the information directly to him.
[00:09:52.523 --> 00:09:55.546]  Trump to go after Mueller for 9-11 Saudi cover-up.
[00:09:55.546 --> 00:09:58.249]  Now you'll remember in January of this year.
[00:09:59.403 --> 00:10:02.285]  Here is the Leanne McAdoo report on that.
[00:10:02.285 --> 00:10:06.108]  Next year's news today or the news of six months from now today.
[00:10:06.108 --> 00:10:07.969]  Mueller's 9-11 cover-up connection.
[00:10:07.969 --> 00:10:10.150]  There's Leanne McAdoo's report on that.
[00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:17.375]  It's been in local Florida papers and other places that Mueller ordered the cover-up that Congress knew.
[00:10:17.375 --> 00:10:21.098]  FBI found direct ties between 9-11 hijackers and Saudis living in Florida.
[00:10:21.098 --> 00:10:22.338]  Congress kept it dark.
[00:10:22.338 --> 00:10:23.459]  That's all the stuff we covered.
[00:10:23.459 --> 00:10:25.260]  How they got bin Laden out of the country.
[00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:26.701]  How they protected him.
[00:10:26.701 --> 00:10:29.083]  And who gave the orders in the Justice Department
[00:10:29.823 --> 00:10:30.944]  To do that.
[00:10:30.944 --> 00:10:38.507]  This goes to the Clintons, the Bushes, the Muellers, the Comeys, the entire deep state.
[00:10:38.507 --> 00:10:39.247]  Okay?
[00:10:39.247 --> 00:10:42.488]  So that is all about to come out.
[00:10:42.488 --> 00:10:53.032]  And so when you see some of the families of 9-11 victims on Tucker Carlson saying Mueller ordered that we couldn't have our lawsuit, he shut it down, he had the FBI not release the information.
[00:10:53.032 --> 00:10:55.213]  That is just the doorway to this.
[00:10:55.213 --> 00:10:57.154]  And so what I'm relaying to you is Trump
[00:10:58.123 --> 00:11:01.145]  Regardless of what the deep state does, he's going to bring everything out.
[00:11:01.145 --> 00:11:07.428]  But he had to first get some Supreme Court judges in, turn the economy around, show everybody he was real.
[00:11:07.428 --> 00:11:13.951]  And now he's preparing to not drain the swamp, but basically napalm it.
[00:11:13.951 --> 00:11:14.691]  Carpet bomb it.
[00:11:14.691 --> 00:11:21.495]  I mean, I don't know what you want to call this, but I have been told that this is the gateway to the traction.
[00:11:21.495 --> 00:11:22.435]  That's how Trump does it.
[00:11:22.435 --> 00:11:26.017]  He enters it at one unrefutable, irrefutable point that
[00:11:27.369 --> 00:11:35.248]  They covered up what happened on 9-11, that they blocked the lawsuits, that Mueller was the guy that quarterbacked all that, and then he quarterbacked the entire cover-up, brought in two days after 9-11.
[00:11:38.061 --> 00:11:47.963]  And that it goes into Saudi Arabia, it goes into the Bushes, it goes into the Clintons, who set it up beforehand, it goes into Saudi Arabia, Al Qaeda, and Trump has them dead to rights.
[00:11:47.963 --> 00:11:52.884]  He has all the documents, he has all the admissions, and he's letting them know, I have the ace of spades.
[00:11:52.884 --> 00:12:03.306]  So, just like Trump back in, we'll pull the clip up, during one of the debates, told Jeb Bush, yeah, your brother did a terrible job on 9-11 standing down, the next day he dropped out.
[00:12:03.746 --> 00:12:05.587]  So we're going to play that clip coming up.
[00:12:05.587 --> 00:12:06.867]  The media criticized Trump.
[00:12:06.867 --> 00:12:13.170]  Trump famously called into CNN a week after 9-11 and said, boy, those buildings sure felt strange, like there was bombs in them.
[00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:16.431]  He wanted everything on record that he knew.
[00:12:16.431 --> 00:12:19.813]  So, Deep State working with radical criminal Islam.
[00:12:20.851 --> 00:12:25.214]  Involving 9-11, the stand down, all of it, the CIA building, building 7 getting blown up.
[00:12:25.214 --> 00:12:38.342]  Trump is preparing and wants you to know and wants us to know and I am the individual that is supposed to say the super hard dangerous things up front.
[00:12:38.342 --> 00:12:39.122]  I'm very honored.
[00:12:39.122 --> 00:12:40.083]  I've asked for that position.
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:41.940]  I don't think we can
[00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:07.392]  Hype this enough how big this is and how huge this is.
[00:13:07.392 --> 00:13:12.354]  I called you last night at 1030 after I got off the phone and then received the information.
[00:13:12.354 --> 00:13:14.635]  You said that you were getting concurrent info.
[00:13:14.635 --> 00:13:17.857]  This is just the beginning of Trump's big rollout, his ace of spades.
[00:13:17.857 --> 00:13:23.079]  I mean, would you call this, the economy's his real ace of spades, and telling the truth's his ace of spades.
[00:13:23.079 --> 00:13:27.501]  But when it comes to devastating the deep state, this torpedo, this black arrow,
[00:13:28.221 --> 00:13:29.882]  Uh, into the heart of smog.
[00:13:29.882 --> 00:13:39.409]  I mean, this, this, this, this is, this is what needs to be done for justice, but it's also must, must strike complete fear into the deep state.
[00:13:39.409 --> 00:13:49.216]  Well, I think the president is now only fully become aware of the extent of Robert Mueller's disastrous record as FBI director.
[00:13:49.216 --> 00:13:53.559]  It is indisputable that he systematically ignored multiple reports
[00:13:54.455 --> 00:14:04.980]  About a Sarasota, Florida flight school where five of nine Saudi hijackers were training for the assault on America on 9-11.
[00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:20.067]  There were multiple complaints from neighbors about strange activities among these men who, according to flight instructors, showed an amazing interest in how to fly and take off, but no interest in how to land.
[00:14:21.607 --> 00:14:41.502]  This was reported to Jeb Bush's Florida Department of Law Enforcement, same thing as the state police in, say, Louisiana or the Texas Rangers there in Texas, who complained repeatedly to the FBI, sent reports to the FBI, which Robert Mueller systematically ignored.
[00:14:43.144 --> 00:14:49.769]  So, his role as being complicit in the cover-up of 9-11 is demonstrable.
[00:14:49.769 --> 00:15:05.403]  The president himself is going to ultimately make the case, but it's the tip of the iceberg in terms of this quote-unquote public servant who Lindsey Graham describes as beyond reproach.
[00:15:05.403 --> 00:15:10.067]  The first three suspects he arrested in the anthrax matter were the wrong men.
[00:15:10.808 --> 00:15:17.152]  The fourth man he ultimately arrested died mysteriously in custody.
[00:15:17.152 --> 00:15:31.262]  There is no question that he let three innocent men rot in a Boston jail in order to cover up FBI mafia informant sources in the Whitey Bulger matter.
[00:15:32.745 --> 00:15:50.932]  He had Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted pedophile, on the FBI hook as an informant, which explains why Epstein was always able to escape more serious charges such as child trafficking.
[00:15:50.932 --> 00:15:51.412]  That's right.
[00:15:51.412 --> 00:15:55.934]  Robert Mueller is confirmed to be the main handler of the main child trafficking.
[00:15:55.934 --> 00:15:57.255]  You heard it here first.
[00:15:57.255 --> 00:15:57.535]  We'll be back.

[00:18:00.293 --> 00:18:03.895]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:18:03.895 --> 00:18:05.675]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:18:05.675 --> 00:18:17.721]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:18:17.721 --> 00:18:22.723]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs,
[00:18:23.503 --> 00:18:32.852]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[00:18:32.852 --> 00:18:37.957]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:18:37.957 --> 00:18:40.580]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:42.301]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:18:42.301 --> 00:18:47.106]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase,
[00:18:47.346 --> 00:18:52.293]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:18:52.293 --> 00:18:54.936]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:18:54.936 --> 00:18:59.642]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.

[00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:26.625]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:20:26.625 --> 00:20:31.188]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:31.188 --> 00:20:32.269]  And here's President Trump
[00:20:33.015 --> 00:20:41.602]  Two plus years ago, telling Jeb Bush, you better watch it, buddy, after what you did standing down in Florida and after what your brother did in D.C.
[00:20:41.602 --> 00:20:47.727]  And now Trump is preparing to start releasing the fact that the deep state was complicit working with radical Islam to carry out 9-11.
[00:20:47.727 --> 00:20:48.388]  Here's the president.
[00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:56.125]  Obviously, the war in Iraq was a big, fat mistake, all right?
[00:20:56.125 --> 00:21:05.172]  Now, you can take it any way you want, and it took Jeb Bush, if you remember, at the beginning of his announcement, when he announced the president, it took him five days.
[00:21:05.172 --> 00:21:05.873]  He went back.
[00:21:05.873 --> 00:21:06.834]  It was a mistake.
[00:21:06.834 --> 00:21:07.774]  It wasn't a mistake.
[00:21:07.774 --> 00:21:14.440]  It took him five days before his people told him what to say, and he ultimately said it was a mistake.
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:17.923]  The war in Iraq, we spent $2 trillion, thousands of lives.
[00:21:18.203 --> 00:21:19.444]  We don't even have it.
[00:21:19.444 --> 00:21:23.766]  Iran is taking over Iraq with the second largest oil reserves in the world.
[00:21:23.766 --> 00:21:25.727]  Obviously it was a mistake.
[00:21:25.727 --> 00:21:27.548]  George Bush made a mistake.
[00:21:27.548 --> 00:21:28.789]  We can make mistakes.
[00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:30.150]  But that one was a beauty.
[00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:32.111]  We should have never been in Iraq.
[00:21:32.111 --> 00:21:34.932]  We have destabilized the Middle East.
[00:21:34.932 --> 00:21:37.574]  So you still think he should be impeached?
[00:21:38.274 --> 00:21:39.496]  You do whatever you want.
[00:21:39.496 --> 00:21:40.758]  You call it whatever you want.
[00:21:40.758 --> 00:21:42.621]  I want to tell you, they lied.
[00:21:42.621 --> 00:21:45.045]  They said there were weapons of mass destruction.
[00:21:45.045 --> 00:21:45.867]  There were none.
[00:21:45.867 --> 00:21:47.329]  And they knew there were none.
[00:21:47.329 --> 00:21:49.833]  There were no weapons of mass destruction.
[00:21:53.072 --> 00:21:57.134]  And there's another clip, too, with him saying, you screwed up on 9-11.
[00:21:57.134 --> 00:21:58.314]  You stood down in Florida.
[00:21:58.314 --> 00:22:00.055]  Your brother stood down.
[00:22:00.055 --> 00:22:01.715]  You guys did a terrible job.
[00:22:01.715 --> 00:22:03.156]  We're going to get that clip for you as well.
[00:22:03.156 --> 00:22:08.318]  We've also got the clip coming up in the next segment where he talks about bombs in the buildings.
[00:22:08.318 --> 00:22:10.038]  So again, this is really, really serious.
[00:22:10.038 --> 00:22:20.082]  The point is, Tucker Carlson has on some of the families where Mueller, on record, basically killed the investigation, didn't let him have the info to sue.
[00:22:22.714 --> 00:22:29.789]  And if you expand on that, we have the article on Infowars.com, Trump to go after Mueller for 9-11 Saudi cover-up.
[00:22:31.496 --> 00:22:38.221]  President about to drop the hammer on former FBI director for burying Saudi involvement in the attacks, as Roger Stone just mentioned.
[00:22:38.221 --> 00:22:40.763]  But this is coffin nails.
[00:22:40.763 --> 00:22:42.905]  This is kryptonite to the deep state, Roger.
[00:22:42.905 --> 00:22:53.033]  And again, the specific thing that I want to relay to everyone is, the exclusive here is, this is only the beginning of what Trump is going to start releasing.
[00:22:53.033 --> 00:22:57.456]  And he's the president, he has the right to declassify anything he wants, and he's letting them know
[00:22:58.493 --> 00:23:02.635]  Let's just say folks are letting them know that that's going on.
[00:23:02.635 --> 00:23:04.256]  So what does that signify?
[00:23:04.256 --> 00:23:10.539]  What do you make of this development that this is starting and that folks want the deep state to know we're coming for them?
[00:23:11.328 --> 00:23:22.074]  Well, I think the President is building the backfire necessary to terminate the Partisan Inquisition being led by Robert Mueller.
[00:23:22.074 --> 00:23:37.544]  I mean, that story in yesterday's and the day before's New York Times about Rod Rosenstein, who very clearly wrote a memo to the President advocating the firing of FBI Director Comey, did not think it would be made public.
[00:23:38.224 --> 00:23:40.946]  Trump, as it is prerogative, made it public.
[00:23:40.946 --> 00:23:46.870]  This embarrassed Rosenstein in front of his deep state buddies where he was trying to have it both ways.
[00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:52.874]  He is furious at Trump and his payback is the appointment of Robert Mueller.
[00:23:52.874 --> 00:23:54.455]  It is as clear as day.
[00:23:55.095 --> 00:23:57.037]  So he's acting in his self-interest.
[00:23:57.037 --> 00:24:02.180]  He has conflicts in that he has gotten his first job from Mueller.
[00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:08.044]  He has conflicts in that he approves the FISA warrant personally.
[00:24:08.044 --> 00:24:11.907]  He's conflicted, more conflicted in this case than Jeff Sessions is.
[00:24:11.907 --> 00:24:15.290]  He needs to stand down or be terminated.
[00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:18.552]  So I think the president is laying the ground for the
[00:24:20.493 --> 00:24:28.315]  For the termination of what is a partisan witch hunt, people need to know more about Mr. Mueller.
[00:24:28.315 --> 00:24:34.517]  He is not the white knight that Lindsey Graham and others in the mainstream media have portrayed.
[00:24:34.517 --> 00:24:41.399]  His role during and after the 9-11 matter needs to be examined.
[00:24:41.399 --> 00:24:49.281]  The fact that he is the man who mules the uranium specimens to Stockholm to close the deal for Uranium One,
[00:24:50.021 --> 00:24:57.548]  At behest of the Clintons, it shows that he is a bipartisan leg man for the deep state.
[00:24:57.548 --> 00:25:05.536]  And he is complicit, therefore, in the largest treasonous financial crime, in terms of dollars, in American history.
[00:25:06.505 --> 00:25:06.745]  And it's
[00:25:28.556 --> 00:25:31.299]  Trying to actually wreck my family again.
[00:25:31.299 --> 00:25:33.240]  I mean, there is no end to these people.
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:34.362]  I've got to sue them now.
[00:25:34.362 --> 00:25:36.824]  They are so diabolical.
[00:25:36.824 --> 00:25:38.465]  They are so crazed.
[00:25:38.465 --> 00:25:44.471]  And then they use Alistair Crowley as the Democratic Party operating system?
[00:25:44.471 --> 00:25:47.414]  I mean, these people are beyond anything you could ever imagine.
[00:25:48.352 --> 00:25:50.576]  It is really, really extraordinary.
[00:25:50.576 --> 00:25:54.221]  But what tells me is Trump's taking the gloves off.
[00:25:54.221 --> 00:26:03.634]  For too long, the early Trump attorneys' piece of legal advice was bend over and hand Robert Mueller the vacillate.
[00:26:04.906 --> 00:26:05.847]  Turn over everything!
[00:26:05.847 --> 00:26:07.567]  Waive all executive privilege!
[00:26:07.567 --> 00:26:10.268]  Give Mueller millions and millions and millions of privileges!
[00:26:10.268 --> 00:26:11.229]  Make him God!
[00:26:11.229 --> 00:26:14.490]  Let him violate all these laws!
[00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:14.890]  Right.
[00:26:14.890 --> 00:26:29.836]  Ignore his use of material from FISA warrants, which is still the linchpin of this whole scandal, what Rosenstein struggles to cover up today, what is being used to harass me and Paul Manafort and others.
[00:26:30.576 --> 00:26:33.679]  So, this tells me Trump is going to war.
[00:26:33.679 --> 00:26:38.903]  It is essential the American people know who and what Mr. Mueller is.
[00:26:38.903 --> 00:26:40.004]  It is not...
[00:26:40.894 --> 00:26:41.495]  That's extraordinary.
[00:27:04.594 --> 00:27:14.422]  And now the President is telegraphing that he's going to start releasing the cover-up, the standout of 9-11, that implicates the Bushes, Mueller, who ran the cover-up itself, and the Clintons.
[00:27:14.422 --> 00:27:23.270]  Because we know Trump is really upset behind the scenes that it's the Bushes and their syndicate that are more effectively fighting his agenda than even the Democrats right now.
[00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:28.475]  And Chuck Todd now has come out and said President Trump is winning, Democrats reeling, close quote.
[00:27:28.475 --> 00:27:31.097]  So Trump now knows who to target, doesn't he, Roger?
[00:27:31.577 --> 00:27:40.548]  Well, look, the poll that I would like to see, which nobody has taken, there is a new poll that shows the two top frontrunners of the Democratic Party.
[00:27:40.548 --> 00:27:46.295]  Old, tired, sick, and bereft of ideas, but still just as greedy, Hillary Clinton.
[00:27:47.476 --> 00:28:04.316]  And Uncle Joe Biden, a man who is literally around the bend, a guy who keeps going around threatening physical violence against Donald Trump, when in fact Trump's got 20 pounds on him, a much longer reach, and in my opinion could put Joe out in one shot.
[00:28:04.316 --> 00:28:05.057]  One shot.
[00:28:05.057 --> 00:28:05.758]  Just an opinion.
[00:28:06.559 --> 00:28:08.962]  So, these are their nominees.
[00:28:08.962 --> 00:28:12.446]  I'd like to see them stacked in a legitimate poll.
[00:28:12.446 --> 00:28:14.108]  Trump vs. Hillary.
[00:28:14.108 --> 00:28:15.971]  Trump vs. Biden for 2020.
[00:28:15.971 --> 00:28:20.056]  I think you'd find the President would crush both of them.
[00:28:20.056 --> 00:28:24.221]  If he ran against Hillary again tomorrow, he would crush her by a larger margin.
[00:28:24.281 --> 00:28:25.562]  And that's why Michael Moore panicked.
[00:28:25.562 --> 00:28:28.644]  He went on Bill Maher this weekend and said, we've got to have an uprising.
[00:28:28.644 --> 00:28:29.905]  A million people surround the Capitol.
[00:28:29.905 --> 00:28:31.707]  Don't let the new Supreme Court pick you in.
[00:28:31.707 --> 00:28:34.629]  And he goes, because Trump's going to win in 2020.
[00:28:34.629 --> 00:28:37.551]  And America's coming back, and they are crapping their britches.
[00:28:37.551 --> 00:28:39.733]  No, and they're absolutely right.
[00:28:39.733 --> 00:28:41.294]  We need to have an uprising.
[00:28:41.294 --> 00:28:47.638]  Circle their circle around the Capitol, demanding a Supreme Court justice who believes in the rule of law.
[00:28:47.638 --> 00:28:48.499]  Be there.
[00:28:48.499 --> 00:28:50.200]  Surround their surrounding.
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:50.821]  That's my view.
[00:28:51.301 --> 00:28:52.142]  Let's do a few more minutes.
[00:28:52.142 --> 00:28:56.508]  I want to play this clip of Trump talking about 9-11 and then ask you a few other key questions straight ahead with Roger Stone.
[00:28:56.508 --> 00:28:57.069]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:28:59.375 --> 00:29:02.838]  I tried other brands, but I came back to my Sunshine.
[00:29:02.838 --> 00:29:05.661]  For the best hot or cold pain relief, get the best.
[00:29:05.661 --> 00:29:07.582]  Get a Sunny Bay Heating Pad.
[00:29:07.582 --> 00:29:12.627]  Sometimes, life can be a pain in the neck, or back, or shoulder.

[00:29:15.929 --> 00:29:22.195]  Did you know that the American College of Physicians said that one of the best ways to treat muscle pain is heat therapy?

[00:29:37.391 --> 00:29:41.796]  Long distance travel or long hours in front of a computer can take its toll on your body.

[00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:57.821]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:22.066 --> 00:33:26.492]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:33:26.492 --> 00:33:27.894]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:31.715 --> 00:33:34.016]  But it was always known as a very, very strong building.
[00:33:34.016 --> 00:33:36.036]  Don't forget, that took a big bomb in the basement.
[00:33:36.036 --> 00:33:39.398]  Now, the basement is the most vulnerable place, because that's your foundation.
[00:33:39.398 --> 00:33:40.758]  And it withstood that.
[00:33:40.758 --> 00:33:49.781]  And I got to see that area about three or four days after it took place, because one of my structural engineers actually took me for a tour, because he did the building.
[00:33:49.781 --> 00:33:51.001]  And I said, I can't believe it.
[00:33:51.001 --> 00:33:55.923]  The building was standing solid, and half of the columns were blown out of itself.
[00:33:55.923 --> 00:33:58.164]  This was an unbelievably powerful building.
[00:33:58.904 --> 00:34:03.388]  If you know anything about structure, it was one of the first buildings that was built from the outside, the steel.
[00:34:03.388 --> 00:34:09.372]  The reason the World Trade Center had such narrow windows is that in between all the windows you had the steel on the outside.
[00:34:09.372 --> 00:34:11.454]  See, the steel on the outside of the building.
[00:34:11.454 --> 00:34:19.040]  That's why when I first looked, and you had big, heavy I-beams, when I first looked at it I couldn't believe it because there was a hole in the steel.
[00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:24.003]  And this is steel that was, you remember the width of the windows of the World Trade Center, folks?
[00:34:24.003 --> 00:34:29.506]  I think, you know, if you were ever up there, they were quite narrow, and in between was this heavy steel.
[00:34:29.506 --> 00:34:38.451]  I said, how could a plane, even a plane, even a 767 or a 747, or whatever it might have been, how could it possibly go through this steel?
[00:34:38.451 --> 00:34:46.796]  I happen to think that they had not only a plane, but they had bombs that exploded almost simultaneously, because I just can't imagine anything being able to go through that wall.
[00:34:48.613 --> 00:34:49.834]  He's had the gall to go after my mother.
[00:34:49.834 --> 00:34:52.096]  The World Trade Center came down during your brother's reign.
[00:34:52.096 --> 00:34:53.497]  He's had the gall to go after my mother.
[00:34:53.497 --> 00:34:54.237]  Remember that.
[00:34:54.237 --> 00:34:54.517]  Hold on.
[00:34:54.517 --> 00:34:56.119]  Let me finish this.
[00:34:56.119 --> 00:34:57.660]  He's had the gall to go after my mother.
[00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:58.380]  That's not keeping us safe.
[00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:02.743]  Look, I won the lottery when I was born 63 years ago and looked up and I saw my mom.
[00:35:02.743 --> 00:35:04.685]  My mom is the strongest woman I know.
[00:35:04.685 --> 00:35:05.265]  She should be running.
[00:35:05.265 --> 00:35:07.427]  This is not about my family or his family.
[00:35:07.427 --> 00:35:07.607]  Okay.
[00:35:09.352 --> 00:35:16.875]  I'm putting a bookend on that, but there's Trump saying, and he owns a bunch of buildings in the area, and he talked to the structural engineer, and he's telling you, I think there were bombs in there.
[00:35:16.875 --> 00:35:21.597]  Well, we have the local news with them removing bombs, reporting there were bombs in the buildings.
[00:35:21.597 --> 00:35:24.258]  Bombs in Building 7, not hit by an airplane.
[00:35:24.258 --> 00:35:25.258]  Trump knows it all.
[00:35:25.258 --> 00:35:28.559]  He's getting ready to bring it all out.
[00:35:28.559 --> 00:35:31.020]  Now, segwaying.
[00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:37.463]  Talking to Roger during the break, he's got a big announcement to make to everybody here about what Trump has decided to do.
[00:35:38.328 --> 00:35:40.512]  And why we see Kelly headed for the exits.
[00:35:40.512 --> 00:35:43.256]  Reportedly he'll be gone July 31st.
[00:35:43.256 --> 00:35:46.821]  Roger Stone, explain what Trump's decided to do for everybody out there.
[00:35:48.035 --> 00:35:52.119]  Well, first of all, there's so much going on.
[00:35:52.119 --> 00:36:02.347]  I point out that my book, The Bush Crime Family, came out 11 days before that debate in which Trump confronted Jeb about his stand-down on 9-11.
[00:36:02.347 --> 00:36:05.910]  Now it will all come out.
[00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:14.498]  It is very important to note that one of those judges, Brett Kavanaugh, a Bush family favorite
[00:36:15.738 --> 00:36:24.640]  He's involved in the cover-up of the Vince Foster death.
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:41.263]  Now, while it has never been established as to whether Foster, a top aide to Bill and Hillary Clinton, the keeper of all their secrets, murdered himself, suicide, or was murdered, I tend to believe that he actually did commit suicide.
[00:36:42.983 --> 00:36:49.786]  His body was moved by Hillary Clinton and two of her henchmen to Fort Marcy Park.
[00:36:49.786 --> 00:37:06.993]  A man named Patrick Knowlton, just an honest citizen, was in the wrong place at the wrong time and saw things he shouldn't have seen pertaining to the dumping of Foster's body, and he was harassed by Special Counsel Brett Kavanaugh.
[00:37:07.879 --> 00:37:17.521]  A clean-up man for the Clintons in shutting down the investigation into how Vince Foster's body got to Fort Marcy Park.
[00:37:17.521 --> 00:37:20.942]  So we definitely don't want him, and we also know Napolitano could be in the running.
[00:37:20.942 --> 00:37:23.503]  They also have this lady who is a Christian.
[00:37:23.503 --> 00:37:27.544]  That's Amy Connie Barrett.
[00:37:27.544 --> 00:37:28.204]  What do you think of her?
[00:37:28.764 --> 00:37:31.428]  Well, she is a stout Catholic.
[00:37:31.428 --> 00:37:36.314]  I'm worried about her not being as libertarian as perhaps I'd like.
[00:37:36.314 --> 00:37:41.241]  I'd like to see a libertarian on the judge, on the court, to balance the conservatives out.
[00:37:41.241 --> 00:37:44.425]  Judge Willett from Texas would be excellent.
[00:37:44.425 --> 00:37:46.408]  I'm coming to the conclusion that the president
[00:37:46.428 --> 00:37:47.629]  Ooh, Attorney General, that's right.
[00:37:47.629 --> 00:37:54.074]  Because that's a two to four year post, instead of... We want somebody young, that's why this lady would be great.
[00:38:15.772 --> 00:38:16.173]  I think?
[00:38:33.131 --> 00:38:41.418]  Now, in your own words, what you said to me during the break, when I told you about my conversation last night, and we also talked last night, you said, Trump has decided to, in your own words,
[00:38:58.413 --> 00:38:59.353]  Take the gloves off.
[00:38:59.353 --> 00:39:00.834]  I think he's going on offense.
[00:39:00.834 --> 00:39:04.696]  I think, look, the two Bloomberg stories this week, I think, told the story.
[00:39:04.696 --> 00:39:06.717]  You said Trump's going to war.
[00:39:06.717 --> 00:39:07.757]  He's going to war.
[00:39:07.757 --> 00:39:16.041]  Because the story that says now that the, now Robert Mueller, according to Bloomberg, will focus on Russian collusion.
[00:39:16.041 --> 00:39:16.441]  Pardon me?
[00:39:17.569 --> 00:39:20.193]  He's had two years and spent $17 million.
[00:39:20.193 --> 00:39:23.879]  I thought that was what he was focused on.
[00:39:23.879 --> 00:39:29.067]  He's turned up nothing, but this one case is turning out to be an embarrassment to him.
[00:39:29.067 --> 00:39:31.071]  The 13 Russians that he can't convict.
[00:39:32.097 --> 00:39:33.939]  Uh, and who are demanding discovery.
[00:39:33.939 --> 00:39:46.891]  Uh, he has, he has, uh, then in a second story, it said he will make decisions about charges against the president, which would have to be included in his final report in the fall.
[00:39:48.544 --> 00:39:49.545]  In October.
[00:39:49.545 --> 00:39:51.166]  Get it, Alex?
[00:39:51.166 --> 00:39:52.087]  October.
[00:39:52.087 --> 00:39:53.949]  Just before the election.
[00:39:53.949 --> 00:39:54.649]  October.
[00:39:54.649 --> 00:39:57.752]  So their game plan is clear.
[00:39:57.752 --> 00:40:02.096]  Anyone who thinks this guy is giving up is wrong.
[00:40:02.096 --> 00:40:04.298]  He is a deep state hitman on a mission.
[00:40:05.098 --> 00:40:15.502]  I am being persecuted specifically because of my role in exposing the corruption of Bill and Hillary Clinton and Clinton's war on women and the crimes of the Bushes.
[00:40:15.502 --> 00:40:22.164]  It's a two-party vendetta to get me because of my support for Donald Trump.
[00:40:22.164 --> 00:40:23.964]  That's why I'm being harassed.
[00:40:23.964 --> 00:40:28.906]  That's why my Fourth Amendments are being violated as they interrogate
[00:40:29.486 --> 00:40:31.108]  You've been banned off Twitter.
[00:40:31.108 --> 00:40:32.990]  They've admittedly hacked into your emails.
[00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:34.612]  Now Skype says you've been banned.
[00:40:34.612 --> 00:40:36.574]  The U.S.
[00:40:36.574 --> 00:40:39.998]  Senate wants every email between Roger Stone and Alex Jones.
[00:40:39.998 --> 00:40:42.621]  That's something they've specifically asked for.
[00:40:42.621 --> 00:40:43.542]  And they shall have.
[00:40:43.542 --> 00:40:46.105]  It is all benign.
[00:40:46.105 --> 00:40:47.627]  You'll find no Russian meddling.
[00:40:47.627 --> 00:40:49.009]  You'll find a lot of truth telling.
[00:40:50.583 --> 00:40:53.745]  And we'll find, like, here's your plane tickets or, you know, here's that.
[00:40:53.745 --> 00:40:56.006]  It's such a violation.
[00:40:56.006 --> 00:40:59.188]  What's the name of that great barbecue place again that we're going to?
[00:40:59.188 --> 00:41:00.029]  That kind of thing.
[00:41:00.029 --> 00:41:02.851]  That's actually what's in there, yeah.
[00:41:02.851 --> 00:41:03.511]  Oh my gosh.
[00:41:03.511 --> 00:41:04.772]  All right, Roger.
[00:41:04.772 --> 00:41:05.492]  Thank you so much.
[00:41:05.492 --> 00:41:06.593]  Have a great Fourth of July.
[00:41:06.593 --> 00:41:08.014]  Trump is going to war.
[00:41:08.014 --> 00:41:08.954]  We're all in a war.
[00:41:08.954 --> 00:41:09.475]  God bless you.
[00:41:10.149 --> 00:41:19.334]  Very special, special news at the War Room tonight, assuming that we can solve our problem with Skype.
[00:41:19.334 --> 00:41:26.437]  It's extraordinary the extent to which the Deep State and the tech left is going to harass me, Alex.
[00:41:26.437 --> 00:41:31.520]  All of my Skype platforms closed down today without explanation, which is why I reach you by phone.
[00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:39.866]  Twitter is manipulating the algorithms at the Stone Cold Truth Facebook page and my personal Facebook page.
[00:41:39.866 --> 00:41:44.609]  I post brilliance and I get back three reposts.
[00:41:44.609 --> 00:41:46.030]  We have the internal documents.
[00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:47.771]  They're doing this to everybody who's affected.
[00:41:47.771 --> 00:41:54.976]  That's why everybody's got to work even harder to by word of mouth spread the word about InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, StoneColdTruth.com.
[00:41:54.976 --> 00:41:58.619]  Roger, have a great Fourth and we'll see you tonight on The War Room one way or another.
[00:42:01.139 --> 00:42:02.320]  Thank you.
[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:06.143]  When we come back, Paul wrote a great article with the Inside Intel.
[00:42:06.143 --> 00:42:09.685]  We gave you a kitsch, done one with some points I added.
[00:42:09.685 --> 00:42:12.267]  It's on Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[00:42:12.267 --> 00:42:14.629]  Please get this out.
[00:42:14.629 --> 00:42:16.150]  This is huge.
[00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:21.654]  Trump threatens to release 9-11 docs implicating Clintons and the Bushes.
[00:42:21.654 --> 00:42:24.196]  Trump sends warning to Deep State.
[00:42:24.196 --> 00:42:27.539]  We should probably just add Mueller, Clintons, Bushes, and their minion Mueller.
[00:42:28.834 --> 00:42:33.336]  This is huge, and it's up on Infowars.com, so get that out to everybody.
[00:42:33.336 --> 00:42:35.257]  Now we're going to go to break.
[00:42:35.257 --> 00:42:37.358]  We come back.
[00:42:37.358 --> 00:42:42.921]  Abolish ICE vandals, throw brick through window of GOP offices, leave graffiti message.
[00:42:42.921 --> 00:42:49.884]  More Republicans confronted, and you've got more people being arrested for threatening to kill Rand Paul.
[00:42:49.884 --> 00:42:51.245]  Goodness gracious.
[00:42:51.245 --> 00:42:52.445]  Think about Rand Paul's gone through.
[00:42:52.445 --> 00:42:55.707]  He's been shot at, a bunch of his ribs broken, physically attacked.
[00:42:57.185 --> 00:42:59.447]  And now this.
[00:42:59.447 --> 00:43:03.390]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:06.172]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[00:43:06.172 --> 00:43:12.957]  But a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[00:43:12.957 --> 00:43:15.720]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:20.285]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[00:43:20.285 --> 00:43:26.754]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[00:43:26.754 --> 00:43:31.721]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[00:43:32.475 --> 00:43:36.398]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[00:43:36.398 --> 00:43:43.584]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[00:43:43.584 --> 00:43:48.288]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[00:43:48.288 --> 00:43:54.514]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[00:43:54.514 --> 00:43:58.477]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[00:43:59.679 --> 00:44:04.520]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:13.982]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins and minerals needed daily.
[00:44:13.982 --> 00:44:18.783]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.
[00:44:18.783 --> 00:44:27.045]  The new platinum standard of advanced multivitamin formulation, Vitamin Mineral Fusion uses a unique delivery system to maximize the effects

[00:44:54.832 --> 00:44:56.652]  Available at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:45:00.695 --> 00:45:11.303]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:45:11.303 --> 00:45:13.364]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:45:13.364 --> 00:45:16.227]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:45:16.227 --> 00:45:17.728]  It's made in the USA.
[00:45:17.728 --> 00:45:20.850]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[00:45:21.070 --> 00:45:24.532]  Absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[00:45:24.532 --> 00:45:26.614]  It is a classical 360 win.
[00:45:26.614 --> 00:45:36.320]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:48.848]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to
[00:45:48.848 --> 00:45:53.132]  To reignite those brush fires to the next level, and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:45:53.132 --> 00:45:56.436]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[00:45:56.436 --> 00:45:58.017]  Now it's time to change our bodies.
[00:45:58.017 --> 00:45:58.718]  With Z-Shield.
[00:45:58.718 --> 00:46:00.040]  At InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:46:00.851 --> 00:46:02.793]  This 4th of July is special.
[00:46:02.793 --> 00:46:04.795]  Everybody can see it, they can feel it.
[00:46:04.795 --> 00:46:09.240]  The globalists are attempting to kill a worldwide awakening to their tyranny.
[00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:13.604]  And America, yet again, is at the heart of the resistance of the globalists.
[00:46:13.604 --> 00:46:18.709]  That's why this 4th of July I'm asking all of our great supporters to think about Infowars now more than ever.
[00:46:18.709 --> 00:46:22.453]  And what would the world be like if Infowars wasn't there resisting the globalists?
[00:46:23.294 --> 00:46:25.575]  What would have happened if you hadn't supported InfoWars?
[00:46:25.575 --> 00:46:27.535]  We would not be having the victories we have today.
[00:46:27.535 --> 00:46:30.676]  So yes, a lot of good things are happening, but the enemy is striking back.
[00:46:30.676 --> 00:46:37.818]  So please, think about InfoWars and funding our operation while you get great products at the same time on the 4th of July that's so historic.
[00:46:37.818 --> 00:46:39.699]  We have record sales going on right now.

[00:46:59.034 --> 00:47:03.896]  Infowarestore.com.
[00:47:03.896 --> 00:47:06.577]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:12.202 --> 00:47:13.144]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:47:13.144 --> 00:47:15.469]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:25.367 --> 00:47:28.209]  We're back live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:47:28.209 --> 00:47:51.048]  I'm your host Alex Jones and I want to open the phones up coming up in the next hour to discuss all the amazing things that are happening and we have several guests joining us who were inside of the riot that the Antifa Democrat globalist operative started in Portland over the weekend that even local newspapers admitted the riot started when Antifa started throwing
[00:47:52.149 --> 00:47:59.315]  Bricks, bottles, and fireworks at the crowd.
[00:47:59.315 --> 00:48:02.157]  And I've seen these explosives.
[00:48:02.157 --> 00:48:08.622]  What they're doing is the mortars that you can shoot out of the big tubes are like hand grenades.
[00:48:08.622 --> 00:48:10.463]  In fact, they are if you put shrapnel around them.
[00:48:10.463 --> 00:48:16.108]  I don't want to give anybody any ideas, but they blow people's hands off all the time.
[00:48:16.108 --> 00:48:18.249]  You know, the mortars go boom and then shoot out of the tube and...
[00:48:19.568 --> 00:48:25.696]  They have a lot of explosive power to create that huge blue flash, white flash, red flash that you see.
[00:48:29.375 --> 00:48:37.958]  Even in China, where they're not allowed to have firearms and stuff, when you hear about the revolts that happen against the government, people steal the fireworks out of the facilities and use those as weapons.
[00:48:37.958 --> 00:48:39.619]  And they are bombs.
[00:48:39.619 --> 00:48:45.481]  And if you watch some of these, these are not normal firecrackers or cherry bombs that are going off, M-80s.
[00:48:45.481 --> 00:48:55.705]  You can see that they are basically throwing larger fireworks at them that are very, very dangerous.
[00:48:55.705 --> 00:48:57.486]  You see the phosphorus shooting out, you name it.
[00:48:59.139 --> 00:49:04.840]  If somebody tries to throw one of those at you, it's my view that's an extremely deadly weapon.
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:14.843]  And I guarantee you, if the police see somebody holding a mortar, lighting it and then throwing it, you have no choice but to take those people out.
[00:49:14.843 --> 00:49:18.463]  This is just becoming outrageously insane.
[00:49:18.463 --> 00:49:21.944]  So, those are not M80s like the news said they're throwing at them.
[00:49:21.944 --> 00:49:25.405]  They are mortars that appear to have had the
[00:49:27.301 --> 00:49:32.443]  Propulsion piece cut off on the back and have been directly wired in with a fuse.
[00:49:32.443 --> 00:49:38.865]  So, let me tell you that's what I do for fun back when I was a teenager and stuff.
[00:49:38.865 --> 00:49:40.926]  My dad showed me how to put a rock on one and then
[00:49:42.299 --> 00:49:42.799]  I don't know.
[00:50:03.567 --> 00:50:05.708]  Back when my dad was a little kid, so he was a highway engineer.
[00:50:05.708 --> 00:50:07.428]  So that's why he had dynamite.
[00:50:07.428 --> 00:50:10.689]  But nowadays, you can't trust Americans with dynamite.
[00:50:10.689 --> 00:50:12.910]  You know, you should never have any attacks with explosives.
[00:50:12.910 --> 00:50:15.731]  And once they make the explosives illegal, then suddenly only the criminals have them.
[00:50:15.731 --> 00:50:17.952]  But I'm digressing off into what happened there.
[00:50:17.952 --> 00:50:21.373]  That's coming up in the third hour.
[00:50:21.373 --> 00:50:22.173]  I've got to reset.
[00:50:22.173 --> 00:50:23.334]  There's so much news here.
[00:50:23.334 --> 00:50:25.935]  I don't even know where to start.
[00:50:25.935 --> 00:50:30.836]  We've got a lot of good news, a lot of bad news, a lot of insane news, a lot of crazy news.
[00:50:30.836 --> 00:50:32.317]  I cannot express to you
[00:50:35.976 --> 00:50:43.562]  How big this is that Trump is getting ready to start the 9-11 drumbeat and bring out what really happened on 9-11.
[00:50:43.562 --> 00:50:53.750]  That is the thinking behind Tucker Carlson having the guest on, the whole 9-11 situation, the families, Mueller ordering that the investigation be shut down, that the FBI not give that to them in their lawsuit.
[00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:54.591]  That's already on record.
[00:50:55.350 --> 00:50:56.651]  It's been reported on by Mainstream News.
[00:50:56.651 --> 00:51:03.535]  But I've been told that Trump is beginning to then bring it all out using this show.
[00:51:03.535 --> 00:51:05.536]  And they want you to know that.
[00:51:05.536 --> 00:51:10.719]  They want Mueller and all you arrogant SOBs to know that it's all coming out.
[00:51:10.719 --> 00:51:19.704]  Epstein and how you had him as a confidential informant for years while he was loading little girls on airplanes to take them to be raped by a bunch of perverts on his island.
[00:51:19.704 --> 00:51:20.385]  That's all confirmed.
[00:51:21.263 --> 00:51:32.845]  And Mueller, just like Whitey Bulger, could kill whoever he wanted, killed reportedly over 100 people, run mafia operations in Boston, assassinate members of other mafias that the FBI wanted taken out.
[00:51:32.845 --> 00:51:38.626]  The FBI was operating as a gang in Boston.
[00:51:38.626 --> 00:51:40.426]  And it wasn't just a few guys that were involved.
[00:51:40.426 --> 00:51:41.386]  That's all confirmed.
[00:51:41.386 --> 00:51:47.227]  And Mueller ran the cover up and tried to frame the Italian mafia for it.
[00:51:47.227 --> 00:51:48.828]  It's unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:51:53.507 --> 00:51:56.410]  But the sex offender Epstein only got like a year for all the stuff he did?
[00:51:56.410 --> 00:51:57.611]  18 months, sir?
[00:51:57.611 --> 00:51:59.292]  Like a year of it?
[00:51:59.292 --> 00:52:01.334]  Yeah, he served 13 months of 18 months.
[00:52:01.334 --> 00:52:01.895]  I remember he said 12.
[00:52:01.895 --> 00:52:03.256]  It was 13 months.
[00:52:03.256 --> 00:52:06.599]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, this is the guy with 20-plus flights with Bill Clinton.
[00:52:06.599 --> 00:52:10.083]  This is the guy flying to these Sheik's Islands that are known to have sex slaves.
[00:52:10.083 --> 00:52:11.644]  It's been confirmed.
[00:52:11.644 --> 00:52:18.471]  Robert Mueller is a nightmarish demon of the Clintons and the Bushes who used all of that
[00:52:19.665 --> 00:52:27.447]  Information that they garnered with public officials and people going to have sex with 13, 12-year-old girls to burn everybody.
[00:52:27.447 --> 00:52:28.347]  And he's a monster.
[00:52:28.347 --> 00:52:29.728]  People are like, well, you better watch out.
[00:52:29.728 --> 00:52:30.608]  Mueller's a criminal.
[00:52:30.608 --> 00:52:33.289]  I know he's a criminal.
[00:52:33.289 --> 00:52:34.969]  I know all about how he operates, man.
[00:52:34.969 --> 00:52:36.670]  Somebody's got to take these guys on.
[00:52:36.670 --> 00:52:39.811]  I don't want to hear, well, you're defiling the FBI.
[00:52:39.811 --> 00:52:41.471]  He's not the FBI.
[00:52:41.471 --> 00:52:44.592]  He's a disgusting nightmare creature.
[00:52:46.072 --> 00:52:47.212]  And he's going down.
[00:52:47.212 --> 00:52:50.053]  Mueller will never politically survive what he's done.
[00:52:50.053 --> 00:52:51.394]  He'll never bring down Trump.
[00:52:51.394 --> 00:52:52.714]  He'll bring nothing down.
[00:52:52.714 --> 00:52:54.955]  He is a loser.
[00:52:54.955 --> 00:53:05.758]  But an arrogant creature for decades operating and getting away with crime after crime after crime after crime against children, against women, against humanity.
[00:53:07.739 --> 00:53:14.664]  And all the innocent people that Whitey Bulger killed, you know, just choking to death, you know, young women for no reason because they heard something.
[00:53:14.664 --> 00:53:16.745]  I'm just, just a lot of really evil stuff.
[00:53:16.745 --> 00:53:18.586]  That's where, that's where he comes from.
[00:53:18.586 --> 00:53:19.867]  That's what Mueller's into.
[00:53:19.867 --> 00:53:21.428]  He's a thug.
[00:53:21.428 --> 00:53:23.169]  He's a gangster.
[00:53:23.169 --> 00:53:26.912]  But now he's up against history and now he's going to lose.
[00:53:26.912 --> 00:53:27.712]  So that's coming up.
[00:53:27.712 --> 00:53:32.896]  Um, we're going to get into ICE throwing bricks through the window and them assaulting people.
[00:53:34.210 --> 00:53:35.031]  Calling for all of it.
[00:53:35.031 --> 00:53:39.033]  And I've got a lot of good news I'm going to get to that I mentioned as well.
[00:53:39.033 --> 00:53:44.236]  We've got Bono warning that the whole global government's collapsing.
[00:53:44.236 --> 00:53:48.519]  Venezuela further protests as country begins running out of water.
[00:53:48.519 --> 00:53:51.521]  Greenpeace activists crash drone into French nuclear plant.
[00:53:51.521 --> 00:53:53.782]  Bunch of vampire killers on the loose.
[00:53:53.782 --> 00:53:58.966]  Satanist women strangle boyfriend in BDSM sex and chop him up in devil sacrifice.
[00:54:01.738 --> 00:54:03.139]  Just carry the type of folks we're up against.
[00:54:03.139 --> 00:54:06.420]  That's all coming up.
[00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:10.441]  But first off, ladies and gentlemen, it's the 4th of July specials we're running right now.
[00:54:10.441 --> 00:54:17.664]  And I want to thank you all that have been supportive, but these are great products you need, and your funding is absolutely essential.
[00:54:19.420 --> 00:54:24.882]  I'm calling this the Second American Revolution Fourth of July Super Sale.
[00:54:24.882 --> 00:54:32.625]  And yes, we keep discounting products more and more because as we discount and we sell more, then we're able to buy more at a lower price.
[00:54:32.625 --> 00:54:34.886]  But then it becomes this catch-22 to sell stuff.
[00:54:35.606 --> 00:54:38.607]  I have to always discount it almost down to cost.
[00:54:38.607 --> 00:54:40.947]  So these are really some great deals.

[00:55:54.835 --> 00:55:57.797]  Alexa Pure Breeze 4-stage ion filter.
[00:56:00.612 --> 00:56:02.754]  At $100 off, it is insane.
[00:56:02.754 --> 00:56:09.482]  I mean, leading competitors with miniaturization, the prices have gone down from $800 to $500.
[00:56:09.482 --> 00:56:11.864]  At $150, it is bonker cuckoo lamb.
[00:56:11.864 --> 00:56:13.246]  Good deal.
[00:56:13.246 --> 00:56:16.390]  We're talking the unit is costing $80-something.
[00:56:18.635 --> 00:56:23.119]  And then there's all the costs involved distributing everything else.
[00:56:23.119 --> 00:56:26.461]  We're talking about making $45 on it.
[00:56:26.461 --> 00:56:31.045]  You go buy these anywhere else, they're $500 with a different body on them.
[00:56:31.045 --> 00:56:33.246]  And it's just insane.
[00:56:33.246 --> 00:56:35.508]  I mean, it's just, you cannot beat that deal.
[00:56:35.508 --> 00:56:40.232]  Look at the massive amounts of reviews, 4.9 stars on Alexa pure bridge.
[00:56:41.715 --> 00:56:42.995]  And it's all over my office.
[00:56:42.995 --> 00:56:44.256]  It's all over my house.
[00:56:44.256 --> 00:56:47.877]  You know, a big, huge room, you need one filter.
[00:56:47.877 --> 00:56:51.138]  But if you've got a smaller house, one for the back of the house, one in the front of your house.
[00:56:51.138 --> 00:56:53.959]  I've got one in every major room of the office.
[00:56:53.959 --> 00:56:58.301]  And it's got the outside first aid filter you just clean off whenever the light turns red.
[00:56:59.522 --> 00:57:01.182]  And then the other filters in it last for years.
[00:57:01.182 --> 00:57:02.983]  We have replacement filters as well.

[00:57:27.588 --> 00:57:28.989]  Without you, the globalists will win.
[00:57:28.989 --> 00:57:29.969]  But they are failing.
[00:57:29.969 --> 00:57:31.390]  They are flagging daily.
[00:57:31.390 --> 00:57:32.931]  But the battle has been joined.
[00:57:32.931 --> 00:57:34.131]  Press the attack.
[00:57:34.131 --> 00:57:35.032]  Press the attack.
[00:57:35.032 --> 00:57:36.532]  Intensify.
[00:57:36.532 --> 00:57:37.373]  Don't look back.
[00:57:37.373 --> 00:57:39.554]  Just swing for the fences, and we will win.
[00:57:39.554 --> 00:57:44.116]  And say a prayer for your family, for America, for the world, for Trump, and for Infowars.
[00:57:44.116 --> 00:57:47.717]  We'll be back with hour number two with a blitzkrieg of critical information.
[00:57:47.717 --> 00:57:48.858]  Please spread the live links.
[00:57:53.271 --> 00:57:58.999]  Years ago, InfoWarsLife created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[00:57:58.999 --> 00:58:06.889]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[00:58:06.889 --> 00:58:10.033]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[00:58:10.253 --> 00:58:15.498]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[00:58:15.498 --> 00:58:18.261]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.
[00:58:18.261 --> 00:58:27.249]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[00:58:27.329 --> 00:58:32.172]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from Infowars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[00:58:57.654 --> 00:59:01.437]  It's you that has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[00:59:01.437 --> 00:59:10.143]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[00:59:10.143 --> 00:59:14.746]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[00:59:14.746 --> 00:59:16.187]  You are the info war.
[00:59:16.187 --> 00:59:19.730]  And now, because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:31.778]  Let everyone go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[00:59:31.778 --> 00:59:39.763]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the InfoWars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[00:59:39.763 --> 00:59:46.808]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[00:59:46.808 --> 00:59:49.550]  We are the renaissance and we are winning.
[00:59:53.304 --> 01:00:19.048]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show Well here we are July 5th 2018 another epic July 4th has come and gone And never has it been more clear where the stakes are for humanity, but I want to make a point.
[01:00:19.048 --> 01:00:22.109]  There's a Churchill quote I'm paraphrasing it that
[01:00:23.436 --> 01:00:25.458]  Many people get hit by history.
[01:00:25.458 --> 01:00:34.144]  They get run over in the street by huge, big, epic developments and they kind of dust themselves off and ignore the point in history that they're in.
[01:00:34.144 --> 01:00:42.211]  But there are other people that get hit by destiny and hit by history and they get up and it changes the course of their lives and countless other people's lives.
[01:00:43.635 --> 01:00:58.696]  And so I want people to remember that the hundreds of millions that died under communism and the tens of millions that died under fascism and other cults and permutations of governmental control and societal mental illness manifest by government debt
[01:00:59.994 --> 01:01:03.996]  We are on the precipice of a new global revolution, a new renaissance.
[01:01:03.996 --> 01:01:10.780]  And we're actually, because of other people's work before us, shitting on a great brain trust of human liberty.
[01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:18.203]  And that we've got a chance to fight for freedom when the odds are actually on our side if we realize it.
[01:01:18.203 --> 01:01:20.845]  We've got to look back on those that didn't have a chance to win.
[01:01:21.874 --> 01:01:31.537]  But took action and did what was right because it was about their soul and about the spiritual, cultural, human decision they were making.
[01:01:31.537 --> 01:01:33.818]  And that's why they were fulfilled.
[01:01:33.818 --> 01:01:36.819]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:01:36.819 --> 01:01:38.279]  I want to thank you all for your prayers.
[01:01:38.279 --> 01:01:43.141]  I want to thank you all for what you've done against the bullies and the peer pressure over the years.
[01:01:43.141 --> 01:01:49.803]  Because if it wasn't for you, and if it wasn't for everything you've done, we wouldn't be here.
[01:01:51.365 --> 01:01:55.717]  Many of those people aren't here today that stood up for what was right.
[01:01:57.691 --> 01:02:03.995]  But in their gut, they believed in you, and they believed in me, and they believed that we could build a better future.
[01:02:03.995 --> 01:02:05.737]  They had goodwill towards people.
[01:02:05.737 --> 01:02:10.960]  They didn't want to use the fact that they had more knowledge than the average person to control that person.
[01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:17.245]  They didn't want to use the fact that they understood how the game was played to then set up a little secret cabal and feed on people.
[01:02:17.245 --> 01:02:26.031]  They had the true vision of human empowerment and the true mastery to empower others and bring them to the next level.
[01:02:26.031 --> 01:02:26.832]  They were Christ-like.
[01:02:27.765 --> 01:02:28.025]  I think?
[01:02:45.916 --> 01:02:48.397]  And your awakening and the decisions you've made.
[01:02:48.397 --> 01:03:08.265]  So, I just want to tell you, as we've passed through this July 4th, 2018, as the globalists launch their riots and their attacks and their lies and their moralizing, that have good cheer, my friends, because we're living in a time and age when the devil knows the time is short, so he sends the beast with wrath.
[01:03:08.265 --> 01:03:10.926]  And there are whole world government systems here, the mark of the beast.
[01:03:10.926 --> 01:03:13.247]  It's going to be a lot of trials, a lot of tribulations, but
[01:03:14.377 --> 01:03:26.845]  We know the truth and we know who wins and we know where this all goes and so that's a very positive fact to understand.
[01:03:26.845 --> 01:03:30.188]  All that matters is what you stand for.
[01:03:30.188 --> 01:03:35.091]  All that matters is not being a coward and not feeding on people that aren't as smart as you.
[01:03:35.091 --> 01:03:36.592]  And the minute you realize that,
[01:03:37.671 --> 01:03:49.816]  You're in God's arms forever, and these Satanists, and these Crowleyites, and these Democrats, and these Chi-Coms, and all these control freaks, who want to control reality, who want to try to become a God, because they merge with AI technology.
[01:03:49.816 --> 01:03:52.917]  They don't understand, they already had a connection to God.
[01:03:52.917 --> 01:03:58.940]  They were already an expression of God's consciousness in the universe, and there was no need to ever even do that.
[01:03:58.940 --> 01:04:00.680]  But that's why we have free will.
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:04.302]  Some people will fall to the lower dimension.
[01:04:04.302 --> 01:04:06.823]  Some people will rise and ascend towards
[01:04:08.095 --> 01:04:11.196]  A communion and a reunification with Christ.
[01:04:11.196 --> 01:04:13.017]  And that's the big choice.
[01:04:13.017 --> 01:04:15.458]  And that's why I know you've made the right choice.
[01:04:15.458 --> 01:04:17.579]  You're not going to find Christ in these whorehouse churches.
[01:04:17.579 --> 01:04:22.441]  That's where the literal globalists run the operation via the World Council of Churches.
[01:04:22.441 --> 01:04:29.245]  But you're going to find the real Christ in your heart, seeking after God and saying, I want to be a good person.
[01:04:29.245 --> 01:04:30.405]  I want to be just.
[01:04:30.405 --> 01:04:31.265]  I want to be honorable.
[01:04:31.265 --> 01:04:32.566]  I'm going to tell the truth.
[01:04:32.566 --> 01:04:36.448]  So again, are those of us here, when we're seeing this great awakening of heroes,
[01:04:37.273 --> 01:04:49.422]  No, the heroes are those in communist China and North Korea and old Soviet Russia and countless other places like Cuba that were tortured and murdered and killed and watched their children go to prison because they didn't deny God the truth.
[01:04:49.422 --> 01:04:54.705]  And to them on this July 4th, I want to thank you all and thank you for 1776 Worldwide.
[01:04:54.705 --> 01:04:55.386]  God bless you all.
[01:04:58.493 --> 01:05:08.000]  InfoWarsLife and InfoWarsLife.com is extremely excited to announce our latest release, Winner's Sun, a revolutionary type of vitamin D3.
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.684]  Winner's Sun is a premium quality vitamin D3 nutritional supplement.
[01:05:12.684 --> 01:05:17.467]  It is produced by extracting oil from healthy nutrient-dense plants known as lichens.
[01:05:17.467 --> 01:05:20.530]  Every batch is analyzed for purity and D3 content.
[01:05:20.530 --> 01:05:22.951]  It's completely free of toxins and allergens.
[01:05:22.951 --> 01:05:26.494]  Simply put, if you want the best at an extremely low price, this is it.
[01:05:26.494 --> 01:05:27.755]  Winner's Sun is the result
[01:05:27.975 --> 01:05:28.235]  Of course!
[01:05:59.476 --> 01:06:04.221]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:04.221 --> 01:06:07.944]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:07.944 --> 01:06:12.328]  Alex Jones the man!
[01:06:12.328 --> 01:06:13.689]  What's up, baby?
[01:06:13.689 --> 01:06:14.970]  This is so silly.
[01:06:58.109 --> 01:07:09.595]  More fun stuff from the crew, because we like having a little bit of fun with my goofier moments here, but when I do get like that, I'm saying I'm alive, I'm not backing down, I'm aware of what you're doing, and we're coming for you.
[01:07:09.595 --> 01:07:13.337]  So, damn the maneuvers, go straight at them.
[01:07:13.337 --> 01:07:16.418]  Let's start this hour with some good news.
[01:07:16.418 --> 01:07:22.581]  The Democrats, the globalists, in every one of their internal publications are running up the white flag, admitting that they're losing.
[01:07:24.741 --> 01:07:38.830]  And they're very upset that the economy and positive thinking and belief in the family is starting to have a little bit of a resurgence because they know like fire, that will spread, burning down their tyranny.
[01:07:38.830 --> 01:07:45.395]  It will bring satisfaction, it will bring normalcy, it will bring productivity, it will bring happiness.
[01:07:45.395 --> 01:07:46.696]  The globalists and their corporate
[01:07:47.679 --> 01:07:48.160]  This is
[01:08:08.387 --> 01:08:09.869]  Is the political reality clear?
[01:08:09.869 --> 01:08:13.573]  Despite his overall unpopularity, President Trump is winning.
[01:08:13.573 --> 01:08:16.377]  And the Democrats right now are reeling.
[01:08:16.377 --> 01:08:17.318]  The Supreme Court.
[01:08:17.318 --> 01:08:22.945]  Mr. Trump is about to shape the court for a generation by choosing a possible tie-breaking conservative justice.
[01:08:22.945 --> 01:08:25.849]  And he's already filled the lower courts with like-minded conservatives.
[01:08:26.309 --> 01:08:27.830]  How about the Republican Party?
[01:08:27.830 --> 01:08:30.692]  The President's approval rating among Republicans is around 90%.
[01:08:30.692 --> 01:08:36.436]  Elected Republicans fear criticizing him, and the party has become a cult of personality.
[01:08:36.436 --> 01:08:36.676]  His.
[01:08:36.676 --> 01:08:38.817]  How about fake news?
[01:08:38.817 --> 01:08:52.066]  Mr. Trump has turned that phrase, which initially referred to the phony Russian-generated stories designed to support his campaign in 2016, into an applause line now to discredit responsible reporting showcasing his misdeeds.
[01:08:52.066 --> 01:08:53.167]  How about credibility?
[01:08:53.167 --> 01:08:56.029]  If reporters faithfully fact-check the President's serial misstatements,
[01:08:56.509 --> 01:09:02.011]  I was going to do it at the end, but there's just too many lies.
[01:09:02.011 --> 01:09:06.013]  I mean, did you catch how they'll tell the truth but assert a lie?
[01:09:06.013 --> 01:09:16.817]  Despite Trump's overall unfavorability, even in their fake Gallup polls and others that add 15 points more of Democrats, he's at 50%.
[01:09:16.817 --> 01:09:19.879]  So that's not the majority being negative.
[01:09:19.879 --> 01:09:25.741]  And they're also calling people and sampling mainly Democrat areas on record to create that illusion.
[01:09:27.008 --> 01:09:30.189]  With all these little followers out there that are mad.
[01:09:30.189 --> 01:09:41.654]  And then he goes on to say, oh, despite fake news initially being to expose Russian bots, well, it turns out 80% of those Russian bots, just some company that got hired in Russia, were for Hillary.
[01:09:41.654 --> 01:09:43.255]  And again, it goes on and on and on and on and on.
[01:09:44.113 --> 01:09:50.359]  So he tells the truth overall that Trump's winning, but inserts lies after lie after lie after lie.
[01:09:50.359 --> 01:09:51.840]  The truth is the economy's coming back.
[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:53.782]  The truth is Trump's hitting on all cylinders.
[01:09:53.782 --> 01:09:57.945]  The truth is you've been caught with your Russiagate thing being a whole hoax.
[01:09:57.945 --> 01:10:02.549]  I saw Bill Clinton on one of those Comedy Central shows last week.
[01:10:02.549 --> 01:10:04.591]  I meant to play it, but he pulled the headline.
[01:10:06.408 --> 01:10:12.829]  I think Trevor Noah is the guy's name, and he's on there going, I tell you, I think Sarah Huckabee Sanders was really nice.
[01:10:12.829 --> 01:10:15.370]  She paid for a meal, she left when she was told to.
[01:10:15.370 --> 01:10:16.330]  That's a good thing.
[01:10:16.330 --> 01:10:18.671]  That makes him sound like a southern gentleman.
[01:10:18.671 --> 01:10:22.132]  But he goes, you know, that bile, that poison's gonna come back.
[01:10:22.132 --> 01:10:25.672]  Trump's vomiting saying all Mexicans are criminals and scum and he hates them.
[01:10:25.672 --> 01:10:31.694]  But when you say all the Mexicans are scum and criminals and you hate them, some of that's gonna come back on your people.
[01:10:31.694 --> 01:10:32.714]  So, you know, he caused that.
[01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:36.622]  Trump never said Mexicans are scum or all criminals are bad.
[01:10:36.622 --> 01:10:40.284]  It's a total lie, but... Let me just say, I'm a gentleman.
[01:10:40.284 --> 01:10:41.685]  Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
[01:10:41.685 --> 01:10:44.226]  I don't condemn kicking her out of the restaurant, by the way.
[01:10:44.226 --> 01:10:47.308]  I'm just saying, she politely even paid for her meal.
[01:10:47.308 --> 01:10:48.008]  And she left.
[01:10:48.008 --> 01:10:49.109]  That's good.
[01:10:49.109 --> 01:10:50.550]  Get your ass out of here.
[01:10:50.550 --> 01:10:56.273]  But the point is, you deserve it because of the poison that Trump spewed out.
[01:10:56.273 --> 01:10:57.954]  Some of that poison's gonna come back up.
[01:10:57.954 --> 01:11:00.096]  That's the quote.
[01:11:00.096 --> 01:11:02.017]  Some of that poison's gonna come back up on you.
[01:11:03.126 --> 01:11:08.275]  See, but Trump didn't say that, but see, by making it sound like he's being congenial and a nice headline.
[01:11:08.275 --> 01:11:11.100]  Oh, look, I don't like what happened to her.
[01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:13.083]  Well, actually, she did deserve it.
[01:11:14.395 --> 01:11:15.635]  But that's how I do it.
[01:11:15.635 --> 01:11:17.296]  That's how I run the things around here.
[01:11:17.296 --> 01:11:19.616]  It's really nice to be able to lie to people like that.
[01:11:19.616 --> 01:11:20.856]  Let's go back to old Toddy.
[01:11:20.856 --> 01:11:21.256]  Here he is.
[01:11:40.031 --> 01:11:44.252]  They've caught him in the Strzok emails, the Page emails, the McCabe emails.
[01:11:44.252 --> 01:11:45.633]  We gotta keep him from getting in.
[01:11:45.633 --> 01:11:46.453]  We're gonna stop him.
[01:11:46.453 --> 01:11:47.433]  We're gonna fix it.
[01:11:47.433 --> 01:11:48.354]  Insurance policies.
[01:11:48.354 --> 01:11:50.594]  Millions of dollars for the fake Fusion GPS.
[01:11:50.594 --> 01:11:51.975]  Mueller breaking all the rules.
[01:11:51.975 --> 01:11:53.075]  The thing going on and on.
[01:11:53.075 --> 01:11:56.276]  Rosenstein controlling the whole deal.
[01:11:56.276 --> 01:12:02.218]  Comey and Strzok covering up for Hillary on the Servergate and Benghazi and Russiagate.
[01:12:02.218 --> 01:12:04.578]  But meanwhile, Chuck Todd says, Oh!
[01:12:04.578 --> 01:12:06.119]  He's succeeded!
[01:12:08.530 --> 01:12:13.995]  In despite the fact there's no evidence that anybody colluded to frame him that we did.
[01:12:13.995 --> 01:12:16.077]  No, you've been caught red-handed.
[01:12:16.077 --> 01:12:18.359]  Continue.
[01:12:18.359 --> 01:12:19.861]  Mr. Trump wins.
[01:12:19.861 --> 01:12:21.062]  The Mueller investigation.
[01:12:21.062 --> 01:12:28.449]  The president has succeeded in convincing millions that the investigation is biased despite trafficking only in innuendo and not providing evidence.
[01:12:28.449 --> 01:12:29.350]  Then there's the economy.
[01:12:29.350 --> 01:12:30.191]  It is doing well.
[01:12:30.191 --> 01:12:31.632]  But it was doing well before he took office.
[01:12:32.933 --> 01:12:42.855]  No, it was slowing before, and now we've got thousands of new factories coming in, and exuberance is up, and they said it would never be above 3%, and it's basically about to be announced at 4%, on and on and on.
[01:12:42.855 --> 01:12:46.796]  So see, that was all Obama did that, who said he'd never get above 3%.
[01:12:46.796 --> 01:12:48.877]  What's he have, a magic wand?
[01:12:48.877 --> 01:12:49.837]  Yeah.
[01:12:49.837 --> 01:12:50.837]  There's a magic wand.
[01:12:50.837 --> 01:12:51.958]  Hoping we're stupid.
[01:12:51.958 --> 01:12:52.818]  Hoping we're gullible.
[01:12:52.818 --> 01:12:53.118]  Here it is.
[01:12:53.882 --> 01:13:00.227]  Biden was doing well before he took office, yet with unemployment down and jobs being created, President Trump is getting this credit.
[01:13:00.227 --> 01:13:03.130]  Still, much of Mr. Trump's success is superficial.
[01:13:03.130 --> 01:13:06.353]  While he's more popular among Republicans, the party overall is shrinking.
[01:13:06.353 --> 01:13:13.398]  His trade war, North Korea, or the Mueller investigation all could turn against him and frankly could turn against him now like North Korea has.
[01:13:14.952 --> 01:13:21.877]  And they're cheerleading that North Korea hasn't done everything it said it would do, but they never even agreed on the new timetable.
[01:13:21.877 --> 01:13:23.579]  And so Pompeo's rushing out there.
[01:13:23.579 --> 01:13:25.760]  We're trying to take North Korea away from China.
[01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:27.222]  They're putting pressure on them.
[01:13:27.222 --> 01:13:29.984]  This is a real tug-of-war to get them to come out of the dark.
[01:13:29.984 --> 01:13:31.765]  China's been keeping them in that bad position.
[01:13:31.765 --> 01:13:32.786]  That's coming up later.
[01:13:32.786 --> 01:13:33.647]  I'm going to break that down.
[01:13:33.647 --> 01:13:36.068]  But Trump's trying to go get peace.
[01:13:36.068 --> 01:13:37.710]  Trump's trying to fix things.
[01:13:37.710 --> 01:13:39.091]  Something you guys never did.
[01:13:40.506 --> 01:13:43.467]  And then Chuck Todd sits up there, bad-mouthing everything.
[01:13:43.467 --> 01:13:44.407]  It's incredible.
[01:13:44.407 --> 01:13:47.068]  Meanwhile, the Republican Party's growing.
[01:13:47.068 --> 01:13:47.708]  It's populist.
[01:13:47.708 --> 01:13:48.728]  We're taking it over.
[01:13:48.728 --> 01:13:53.429]  It's getting more gubernatorial seats, more statehouse seats, more federal seats.
[01:13:53.429 --> 01:14:01.291]  The Democratic Party is a bizarro, elitist, coastal party.
[01:14:01.291 --> 01:14:08.093]  Its only hope is to bring in dumbed-down, third-world populations that are on their payroll.
[01:14:09.059 --> 01:14:18.343]  So again, that's just Chuck Todd trying to hold the line, hold the forces during collapse, make everybody think that they've got a shot from coming back from the dead and betting against the U.S.
[01:14:18.343 --> 01:14:20.624]  economy, saying it could turn, it could turn any moment.
[01:14:20.624 --> 01:14:21.464]  It's superficial.
[01:14:21.464 --> 01:14:22.705]  America isn't strong.
[01:14:22.705 --> 01:14:23.685]  By the way, I'm Chuck Todd.
[01:14:23.685 --> 01:14:24.386]  I love America.
[01:14:24.386 --> 01:14:25.586]  Remember CNN?
[01:14:25.586 --> 01:14:26.887]  We don't hate America.
[01:14:26.887 --> 01:14:27.627]  We love America.
[01:14:27.627 --> 01:14:28.448]  We don't hate Americans.
[01:14:28.448 --> 01:14:29.148]  We love Americans.
[01:14:30.612 --> 01:14:32.334]  Yeah, right.
[01:14:32.334 --> 01:14:36.978]  Bono warns that existence of UN, EU and NATO are threatened.
[01:14:36.978 --> 01:14:40.442]  Well, the UN's a big criminal body with a horrible, wicked record.
[01:14:41.661 --> 01:14:45.163]  It's civil human rights commissions run by a bunch of dictators and mass murderers.
[01:14:45.163 --> 01:14:46.584]  It's literally a joke.
[01:14:46.584 --> 01:14:49.086]  The EU was created after a Nazi plan.
[01:14:49.086 --> 01:14:51.407]  It has an unelected bureaucracy that runs it.
[01:14:51.407 --> 01:14:55.009]  NATO's completely out of control, drug dealing, child sex trafficking.
[01:14:55.009 --> 01:14:56.170]  And he says they're all threatened.
[01:14:56.170 --> 01:15:04.875]  And Bono's the little UN guy who goes out and says, save it, who gives less than 1% of the money he raises, billions of dollars, $3 billion he's raised.
[01:15:04.875 --> 01:15:06.796]  For African aid, he keeps $99.
[01:15:10.694 --> 01:15:13.516]  Talk about a monster pig creature.
[01:15:13.516 --> 01:15:18.300]  Meanwhile, Venezuela further protests as country begins running out of water.
[01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:19.921]  I'm going to get more into that.
[01:15:19.921 --> 01:15:24.644]  Brian Ross leaving ABC after lying about General Flynn and saying he was a Russian agent.
[01:15:24.644 --> 01:15:30.009]  We've got Archbishop condemned for cover up a pedophile is now in hiding.
[01:15:31.144 --> 01:15:33.146]  Yeah, I think the rats are in trouble.
[01:15:33.146 --> 01:15:40.233]  The rats that have hijacked the Catholic Church, the rats that have hijacked the FBI, the rats that have hijacked almost everything in this society.
[01:15:40.233 --> 01:15:43.616]  We're aware of it now and understand what's happening.
[01:15:43.616 --> 01:15:48.601]  So it's all coming up on the other side of this quick break.
[01:15:48.601 --> 01:15:52.284]  Please stay with us and please share the fact of where you're listening and how you're listening.
[01:15:52.284 --> 01:15:54.326]  That's critical to get around the censors.

[01:15:57.443 --> 01:16:00.504]  Want revenge on the common housefly?
[01:16:00.504 --> 01:16:04.485]  Well, after 10,000 years, someone has finally come up with a better way.
[01:16:04.485 --> 01:16:05.745]  The Bug-A-Salt.
[01:16:05.745 --> 01:16:10.687]  A miniaturized shotgun, which utilizes ordinary table salt as ammunition.

[01:17:58.615 --> 01:18:00.556]  This 4th of July is special.
[01:18:00.556 --> 01:18:02.557]  Everybody can see it, they can feel it.
[01:18:02.557 --> 01:18:06.980]  The globalists are attempting to kill a worldwide awakening to their tyranny.
[01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:11.362]  And America, yet again, is at the heart of the resistance to the globalists.
[01:18:11.362 --> 01:18:16.465]  That's why this 4th of July I'm asking all of our great supporters to think about Infowars now more than ever.
[01:18:16.465 --> 01:18:20.208]  And what would the world be like if Infowars wasn't there resisting the globalists?
[01:18:21.048 --> 01:18:23.329]  What would have happened if you hadn't supported InfoWars?
[01:18:23.329 --> 01:18:25.290]  We would not be having the victories we have today.
[01:18:25.290 --> 01:18:28.431]  So yes, a lot of good things are happening, but the enemy is striking back.
[01:18:28.431 --> 01:18:35.573]  So please, think about InfoWars and funding our operation while you get great products at the same time on the 4th of July that's so historic.
[01:18:35.573 --> 01:18:37.454]  We have record sales going on right now.

[01:20:01.373 --> 01:20:03.994]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:09.505 --> 01:20:16.575]  A lot of his supporters believe that we are the enemy of the American people, and that is really, really an awful situation.
[01:20:16.575 --> 01:20:18.818]  We are not the enemy of the American people.
[01:20:18.818 --> 01:20:20.180]  We love the American people.
[01:20:31.394 --> 01:20:33.616]  We are not the enemy of the American people.
[01:20:33.616 --> 01:20:35.117]  We love the American people.
[01:20:35.117 --> 01:20:38.480]  We love the American people.
[01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:40.021]  We love the American people.
[01:20:40.021 --> 01:20:54.794]  They came in peace.
[01:20:54.794 --> 01:20:57.016]  We are not the enemy of the American people.
[01:20:57.016 --> 01:20:58.457]  We love the American people.
[01:21:13.263 --> 01:21:27.130]  A lot of poison has been poured down America's throat since that 2016 campaign started.
[01:21:27.130 --> 01:21:29.952]  Started off calling Mexicans rapists and murderers.
[01:21:29.952 --> 01:21:35.295]  So it's hard to pour poison down other people's throat and not have some of it come back up and bubble up.
[01:21:42.961 --> 01:21:46.485]  Incredible, isn't it?
[01:21:46.485 --> 01:21:48.126]  Now, shifting gears.
[01:21:48.126 --> 01:21:50.488]  Maxine Waters has raised the battle cry.
[01:21:50.488 --> 01:21:52.150]  Michael Moore has raised the battle cry.
[01:21:52.150 --> 01:22:04.302]  You've got all these people getting arrested for going out and saying kill Rand Paul, murder his children, murder his wife, rub their intestines all over the walls in a helter-skelter type killing.
[01:22:05.236 --> 01:22:06.637]  That's all coming up in this segment.
[01:22:06.637 --> 01:22:07.398]  I'll be breaking it down.
[01:22:07.398 --> 01:22:13.162]  But I thought we'd kick it off first with a reminder of Mad Maxine in her latest speech.
[01:22:13.162 --> 01:22:15.203]  Says, we are sick and tired of Trump.
[01:22:15.203 --> 01:22:16.424]  He's been there too long.
[01:22:16.424 --> 01:22:17.124]  Impeach 45.
[01:22:17.124 --> 01:22:20.587]  Yeah, because you didn't like the election.
[01:22:20.587 --> 01:22:22.088]  You don't like the economy coming back.
[01:22:22.088 --> 01:22:24.469]  That your boot on our necks being removed.
[01:22:24.469 --> 01:22:32.775]  And you can see your corrupt power dwaning and your party disappearing.
[01:22:32.775 --> 01:22:33.536]  And that's what's happening.
[01:22:34.397 --> 01:22:36.158]  You can see all of it disappearing.
[01:22:36.158 --> 01:22:38.459]  You can see it running through your fingers.
[01:22:38.459 --> 01:22:40.959]  So here is Mad Max.
[01:22:40.959 --> 01:22:46.321]  I am not about to let this country go by the way of Donald Trump.
[01:22:46.321 --> 01:22:48.622]  We are sick and tired of him.
[01:22:48.622 --> 01:22:50.223]  He's been there too long.
[01:22:50.223 --> 01:22:52.284]  They dare me to say impeach him.
[01:22:52.284 --> 01:22:53.864]  Today I say impeach 45!
[01:23:01.172 --> 01:23:06.955]  Today I say Donald Trump, this is not your country to do with whatever you want to do.
[01:23:06.955 --> 01:23:08.856]  This country belongs to all of us!
[01:23:10.757 --> 01:23:35.410]  And the Supreme Court upheld five countries that don't even have working airports, where the Imams give them passports, and then occasional charter flights fly out, and then unvetted people from Libya, Somalia, Sudan, where they sell humans in slave markets, where women, unattended, are kidnapped in minutes and gang-raped?
[01:23:35.410 --> 01:23:37.291]  And then she's calling that bad.
[01:23:37.291 --> 01:23:40.093]  Just like Bill Clinton says that
[01:23:41.064 --> 01:23:45.588]  Trump says he hates Mexicans and that Mexicans are criminals.
[01:23:45.588 --> 01:23:49.231]  No, he said we have an open border with a lot of criminals pouring across, back and forth.
[01:23:49.231 --> 01:23:50.172]  It's dangerous.
[01:23:50.172 --> 01:23:54.696]  So again, they just regurgitate that lie over and over again.
[01:23:54.696 --> 01:23:56.178]  Let's go ahead and go to this.
[01:23:56.178 --> 01:24:05.926]  Scott Pruitt becomes latest Trump official to be harassed at a restaurant with a fake, sanctimonious, angry woman with her kid in his face like he's done something bad.
[01:24:06.747 --> 01:24:13.210]  Then we've got abolish ICE vandals, throw brick through window of GOP office, leave graffiti message.
[01:24:13.210 --> 01:24:15.171]  Here is the latest video.
[01:24:15.171 --> 01:24:19.033]  We deserve to have somebody who actually does protect our environment.
[01:24:19.033 --> 01:24:26.836]  Somebody who believes in climate change and takes it seriously for the benefit of all of us, including our children.
[01:24:26.836 --> 01:24:32.138]  So I would urge you to resign before your vandals push you out.
[01:24:32.138 --> 01:24:32.859]  So there you go.
[01:24:35.086 --> 01:24:37.967]  Again, America's having its carbon cut off to bankrupt us.
[01:24:37.967 --> 01:24:40.788]  China has no carbon restrictions, neither does India or Mexico.
[01:24:40.788 --> 01:24:50.492]  This is an admitted plan to bankrupt us and pay Al Gore, the Rothschilds, and Soros trillions of dollars if they ever got their carbon tax, but that's going up in flame as well.
[01:24:50.492 --> 01:24:54.254]  There's the Nebraska Republican Party had the old brick thrown through.
[01:24:54.254 --> 01:24:56.355]  Abolish ICE, and that's the Democrats' big
[01:24:58.024 --> 01:24:59.788]  We're good to go.
[01:25:09.286 --> 01:25:16.910]  In major studies, it varies from country to country, but it's normally six times more likely to steal, nine times more likely not to give to charity.
[01:25:16.910 --> 01:25:29.056]  Just type in liberals are more mentally ill, liberals are more psychotic, liberals are less likely to give to charity, liberals are less likely to keep a job, liberals are more likely to steal.
[01:25:29.056 --> 01:25:32.598]  There are studies in Canada, Australia, corporations all know this.
[01:25:33.158 --> 01:25:41.893]  They're virtue signaling snot-nosed control freaks who live to rule everyone else and get in everyone else's business.
[01:25:41.893 --> 01:25:42.594]  That's what they do.
[01:25:43.906 --> 01:25:49.850]  And most of your psychologists in this country now are Democrat priesthood who just replaced confession.
[01:25:49.850 --> 01:25:55.654]  And all they do is work around the clock to break up families and destroy this country in many cases.
[01:25:55.654 --> 01:25:57.255]  It's unbelievable.
[01:25:57.255 --> 01:25:59.757]  It's not in all cases, but that's what's going on.
[01:25:59.757 --> 01:26:01.218]  And it's being exposed.
[01:26:01.218 --> 01:26:04.220]  People are figuring out that there is a cult of control freaks.
[01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:05.982]  I've done a survey and looked at it.
[01:26:05.982 --> 01:26:12.086]  And you know what the most popular, I've got TV shows about it now, the most popular thing with the average Democrat now is Alistair Crowley.
[01:26:14.127 --> 01:26:40.056]  And you look at the WikiLeaks, and you look at the Podestas, and you look at Ravamovich, and all these people is, they are into the occult, they are little magic-thinking Harry Potter fans, and they graduate to Aleister Crowley, and they are falling apart, they are losers, they are failures looking for power instead of just being good, and realizing God's there, and that is the power, and that you were already ascended if you love God.
[01:26:41.715 --> 01:26:49.210]  But instead they always die in a big pile of their own feces and total failure like Aleister Crowley, another delusional fruit bowl.
[01:26:49.210 --> 01:26:51.535]  So, let's continue with Jennifer Rubin.
[01:26:51.535 --> 01:26:51.835]  Here it is.
[01:26:53.103 --> 01:26:57.266]  What's most successful is getting a million people on the street to protest.
[01:27:13.519 --> 01:27:14.420]  That's their plan.
[01:27:14.420 --> 01:27:16.361]  The left in their own documents say, we don't do it.
[01:27:16.361 --> 01:27:17.381]  We wear masks.
[01:27:17.381 --> 01:27:22.384]  The white people, the professors, they go out and burn some stuff, get it started, and then hope they can get black folks too.
[01:27:22.384 --> 01:27:24.806]  That's in the documents that are up on Infowars.com.
[01:27:24.806 --> 01:27:25.286]  Let's continue.
[01:27:25.967 --> 01:27:30.871]  But what's most successful is getting a million people on the street to protest.
[01:27:30.871 --> 01:27:36.696]  So let's redirect all of that good pent-up energy to something that makes a difference.
[01:27:36.696 --> 01:27:43.442]  Let's get a million people to go to Maine or a million people to go to Alaska and start putting pressure on those senators.
[01:27:43.442 --> 01:27:46.004]  So it's perfectly civil to do that.
[01:27:46.004 --> 01:27:48.766]  No one's telling them to be violent protesters.
[01:27:48.766 --> 01:27:50.548]  But we're not going to let these people go through life
[01:27:50.728 --> 01:27:52.409]  Look how mentally ill all those Democrats look.
[01:28:08.055 --> 01:28:11.097]  Look, if you're watching on TV, they're kind of all looking off in the distance.
[01:28:11.097 --> 01:28:12.018]  They always are.
[01:28:12.018 --> 01:28:12.738]  They got tics.
[01:28:12.738 --> 01:28:15.160]  They're all just they're weak, stupid people.
[01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:22.705]  And they've been bred and contained and put up on pedestals and given their participation trophies.
[01:28:22.705 --> 01:28:26.687]  And now they are at war with prosperity and capitalism.
[01:28:26.687 --> 01:28:37.995]  And they are the biggest dupes of the mega banks and the trillionaire companies and the people worth hundreds of billions that pay no tax, that literally fund them and then run slave factories with suicide nets and forced abortion.
[01:28:38.015 --> 01:28:39.536]  I don't think so.
[01:28:57.611 --> 01:29:01.452]  Tired of being censored by Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Patreon?

[01:33:34.776 --> 01:33:50.023]  President Trump gives every indication by what he says and what he does and what he doesn't do that he's mean as a wolverine.
[01:33:59.335 --> 01:34:04.580]  It's 11.59 at Radio Free America, and this is Uncle Sam with music and the truth until dawn.
[01:34:04.580 --> 01:34:08.604]  Right now, I've got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied zone.
[01:34:08.604 --> 01:34:10.666]  The chair is against the wall.
[01:34:10.666 --> 01:34:12.888]  The chair is against the wall.
[01:34:12.888 --> 01:34:14.889]  John has a long mustache.
[01:34:14.889 --> 01:34:16.931]  John has a long mustache.
[01:34:16.931 --> 01:34:19.614]  It's 12 o'clock, Americans, another day closer to victory.
[01:34:19.614 --> 01:34:23.858]  And for all of you out there on or behind the lines, this is your song.
[01:34:29.774 --> 01:34:31.255]  But they took a lot of people away.
[01:34:31.255 --> 01:34:33.776]  People that they thought were gonna make trouble for them.
[01:34:33.776 --> 01:34:36.937]  People that had guns and things they wanted, they just took them away.
[01:34:36.937 --> 01:34:38.377]  Where?
[01:34:38.377 --> 01:34:40.158]  Re-education camps, that's what they call it.
[01:34:40.158 --> 01:34:48.661]  So part of it is you have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[01:34:48.661 --> 01:34:52.543]  I have decided we really need camps for adults.
[01:34:54.629 --> 01:35:03.272]  All persons of Japanese descent were required to register.
[01:35:03.272 --> 01:35:10.554]  Now they were taken to racetracks and fairgrounds where the army almost overnight had built assembly centers.
[01:35:10.554 --> 01:35:14.155]  What kind of a situation in the U.S.
[01:35:14.155 --> 01:35:15.236]  would you see that happening?
[01:35:15.236 --> 01:35:19.177]  I mean, we've got a lot of constitutionalists and a lot of people that stockpile weapons.
[01:35:19.817 --> 01:35:29.785]  Plus you have a lot of people that are coming out of the military that have the ability and the knowledge to build IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques.
[01:35:29.785 --> 01:35:35.790]  These people are radicalized and they don't support the United States and they're disloyal to the United States.
[01:35:35.790 --> 01:35:40.354]  It's our right and our obligation to segregate them from the normal community.
[01:35:47.176 --> 01:35:49.657]  It's what we're doing here, and let's not kid about it.
[01:35:49.657 --> 01:35:53.580]  We're building a domestic army because the government is afraid of its own citizens.
[01:35:53.580 --> 01:35:54.720]  Seriously.
[01:35:54.720 --> 01:35:57.942]  Put your gun down, really?
[01:35:57.942 --> 01:36:02.925]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[01:36:02.925 --> 01:36:04.646]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:36:04.646 --> 01:36:08.608]  Are you some kind of a constitutionalist?
[01:36:08.608 --> 01:36:09.488]  Marines!
[01:36:09.488 --> 01:36:10.949]  So these people
[01:36:17.750 --> 01:36:21.641]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:36:35.749 --> 01:36:42.273]  President Trump gives every indication by what he says and what he does and what he doesn't do.
[01:36:42.273 --> 01:36:44.815]  That he's mean as a wolverine.
[01:36:44.815 --> 01:36:46.476]  Wolverines!
[01:36:46.476 --> 01:36:50.139]  We're back live ladies and gentlemen.
[01:36:50.139 --> 01:36:50.979]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:36:50.979 --> 01:36:55.082]  I'm gonna take some phone calls coming up in the next segment and right through into the next hour.
[01:36:55.082 --> 01:36:57.183]  The toll-free number to join us on This Day Before.
[01:36:58.183 --> 01:37:06.107]  The 4th of July-level broadcast, July 3rd, 2018, is 877-789-ALEX.
[01:37:06.107 --> 01:37:06.747]  877-789-2539.
[01:37:06.747 --> 01:37:15.892]  And we will get you up and on the air to talk about all the huge news that's breaking, all the big developments.
[01:37:15.892 --> 01:37:18.193]  What do you make of what I covered first hour?
[01:37:18.193 --> 01:37:22.435]  That Trump is preparing to start releasing 9-11 information about the stand-down?
[01:37:24.286 --> 01:37:26.347]  About Robert Mueller and the cover-up, all of it.
[01:37:26.347 --> 01:37:33.229]  That's an exclusive to Infowars.com from high-level sources.
[01:37:33.229 --> 01:37:35.029]  And we get into the opening salvos of that.
[01:37:35.029 --> 01:37:36.670]  It's a big, big deal.
[01:37:36.670 --> 01:37:41.711]  Now, let me hit something really critical.
[01:37:41.711 --> 01:37:47.453]  If you try to watch any major Netflix movie, or you try to go to the movie theater, or you try to just go online,
[01:37:48.959 --> 01:37:55.801]  Almost every major storyline, movie, you name it, has evil white people hurting black people.
[01:37:55.801 --> 01:38:03.444]  And they're making hundreds of movies the last few years where it's just saturated everywhere about injustices in the past.
[01:38:03.444 --> 01:38:14.188]  And the newest movie is The Purge, the first Purge, where it shows the army and a Trumpian-like future with Van Jones in the movie.
[01:38:16.437 --> 01:38:22.603]  With the army wearing KKK uniforms coming out and killing black people and their children.
[01:38:22.603 --> 01:38:27.447]  This is all a simulation to create the idea that this is happening.
[01:38:27.447 --> 01:38:36.997]  If you read the documents we got in January from 2015, where the Soros group was trying to create civil war and race war to bring in martial law.
[01:38:38.033 --> 01:38:40.494]  And it's their own documents where they're setting it up.
[01:38:40.494 --> 01:38:52.660]  It's their own documents where they're doing it, where they're in Maryland, in Baltimore, and other blue city areas, working with local police to stage attacks, burn this, attack that.
[01:38:52.660 --> 01:38:53.921]  It's why it's always stylized.
[01:38:53.921 --> 01:38:57.023]  Turn over a dumpster.
[01:38:57.023 --> 01:38:58.383]  Burn a trash can.
[01:38:58.383 --> 01:38:59.544]  Knock out some corporate
[01:39:00.776 --> 01:39:01.016]  I think?
[01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:20.240]  Wanty body looking.
[01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:22.341]  This is criminal racketeering, in my view.
[01:39:22.341 --> 01:39:24.341]  We need indictments by the Justice Department.
[01:39:24.341 --> 01:39:26.141]  This is Soros' son running all this.
[01:39:26.141 --> 01:39:27.722]  This is unbelievable.
[01:39:27.722 --> 01:39:31.863]  And they sign on to it, their action plan, everything.
[01:39:31.863 --> 01:39:35.463]  And so when you see the massive level of brainwashing, you know what they're trying to do.
[01:39:35.463 --> 01:39:37.364]  They're trying to get a Charlottesville-type event going.
[01:39:37.364 --> 01:39:41.005]  They're trying to get normal anti-Trump crowds out.
[01:39:41.005 --> 01:39:46.986]  Then they're trying to have some white supremacist or white supremacist-like-type groups come that are obviously led by the globalists.
[01:39:46.986 --> 01:39:47.626]  It's even come out.
[01:39:48.697 --> 01:39:55.542]  To then have the clash and then blame it on Trump and America to create an explosion in this country.
[01:39:55.542 --> 01:40:01.346]  And the removal of the Confederate statues and all of this that people just wander by and don't even care about.
[01:40:01.346 --> 01:40:03.808]  It's all just done to create a tender box.
[01:40:03.808 --> 01:40:04.969]  And you can see it in the news.
[01:40:04.969 --> 01:40:08.351]  They're hyping it, they're hyping it, they're hyping it, they're hyping it.
[01:40:08.351 --> 01:40:14.296]  Now, when we come back, before I go to your calls, what are they really hyping other than that, even bigger than race war?
[01:40:16.087 --> 01:40:18.149]  This just went up on Infowars.com.
[01:40:18.149 --> 01:40:18.930]  It's an exclusive.
[01:40:18.930 --> 01:40:20.972]  Nobody else has picked this up.
[01:40:20.972 --> 01:40:22.434]  Dragtots.
[01:40:22.434 --> 01:40:23.154]  Cartoon.
[01:40:23.154 --> 01:40:24.556]  Sparks Outrage.
[01:40:24.556 --> 01:40:26.378]  Baby drag queen cartoon.
[01:40:26.378 --> 01:40:27.999]  Marketed to young children.
[01:40:27.999 --> 01:40:32.164]  And again, we've gone to... In fact, it's back there in the producer's office.
[01:40:32.164 --> 01:40:32.845]  We've gone to...
[01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:38.803]  Target before and then seen, you know, the feminist baby.
[01:40:38.803 --> 01:40:41.105]  And she's not going to be a girl, she's going to be a boy.
[01:40:41.105 --> 01:40:42.846]  And there's a little picture of her naked butt in it.
[01:40:42.846 --> 01:40:44.367]  It's all very weird.
[01:40:44.367 --> 01:40:46.708]  And this is so creepy, folks.
[01:40:46.708 --> 01:40:48.229]  This is pedophilia in my view.
[01:40:48.229 --> 01:40:54.714]  This whole agenda, I'm not saying these people are that made this, but the agenda of sexualizing children, going into the schools,
[01:40:55.454 --> 01:41:02.580]  Going in when they're 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 years old and showing them this and confusing them is designed to create mental illness.
[01:41:02.580 --> 01:41:06.923]  And Camille Paglia is a classical liberal and a lesbian and she'll tell you that.
[01:41:06.923 --> 01:41:08.344]  That's a fact.
[01:41:08.344 --> 01:41:09.085]  I'm a libertarian.
[01:41:09.085 --> 01:41:10.526]  This is not adult activity.
[01:41:10.526 --> 01:41:11.526]  This is targeting children.
[01:41:11.526 --> 01:41:13.588]  Now here it is, baby feminist.
[01:41:13.588 --> 01:41:16.210]  And then she says she's a boy in here.
[01:41:16.210 --> 01:41:20.153]  Again, it isn't about a woman if she wants to be a man being a man or thinking she is.
[01:41:20.153 --> 01:41:21.894]  It's about them force feeding it.
[01:41:21.894 --> 01:41:22.695]  It's all coming up.
[01:41:24.048 --> 01:41:24.849]  In the next segment.
[01:41:45.229 --> 01:41:49.570]  Make the planet victorious agenda, pro-human, anti-eugenics agenda.
[01:41:49.570 --> 01:41:50.711]  We are the vanguard.
[01:41:50.711 --> 01:41:56.353]  We are the attack ship that goes out from the mothership and goes in and draws the enemy fire.
[01:41:56.353 --> 01:41:59.053]  If they can get us shut down, they believe it's a devastating victory.
[01:41:59.053 --> 01:42:07.136]  So, recommit this July 4th, which I'm calling the kickoff of the second American revolution of information and of prosperity and of truth and of justice.
[01:42:08.156 --> 01:42:10.917]  They're launching their revolution, we're launching ours.

[01:42:57.642 --> 01:42:59.583]  This 4th of July is special.
[01:42:59.583 --> 01:43:01.584]  Everybody can see it, they can feel it.
[01:43:01.584 --> 01:43:06.026]  The globalists are attempting to kill a worldwide awakening to their tyranny.
[01:43:06.026 --> 01:43:10.388]  And America, yet again, is at the heart of the resistance of the globalists.
[01:43:10.388 --> 01:43:15.490]  That's why this 4th of July I'm asking all of our great supporters to think about Infowars now more than ever.
[01:43:15.490 --> 01:43:19.232]  And what would the world be like if Infowars wasn't there resisting the globalists?
[01:43:20.092 --> 01:43:22.374]  What would have happened if you hadn't supported InfoWars?
[01:43:22.374 --> 01:43:24.316]  We would not be having the victories we have today.
[01:43:24.316 --> 01:43:27.479]  So yes, a lot of good things are happening, but the enemy is striking back.
[01:43:27.479 --> 01:43:34.626]  So please, think about InfoWars and funding our operation while you get great products at the same time on this 4th of July that's so historic.
[01:43:34.626 --> 01:43:36.487]  We have record sales going on right now.

[01:43:55.812 --> 01:43:56.893]  Infowarestore.com.
[01:43:57.506 --> 01:44:01.467]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[01:44:01.467 --> 01:44:04.748]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[01:44:04.748 --> 01:44:11.010]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[01:44:11.010 --> 01:44:13.791]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[01:44:14.531 --> 01:44:18.354]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[01:44:18.354 --> 01:44:24.818]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[01:44:24.818 --> 01:44:29.782]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[01:44:30.529 --> 01:44:34.471]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[01:44:34.471 --> 01:44:41.654]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[01:44:41.654 --> 01:44:46.356]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[01:44:46.356 --> 01:44:52.558]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:44:52.558 --> 01:44:56.540]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:44:58.817 --> 01:45:01.140]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[01:47:00.805 --> 01:47:03.468]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:29.835 --> 01:47:34.278]  I've got a topic I'm about to break down that's extremely disturbing.
[01:47:34.278 --> 01:47:42.504]  And I'd say parental discretion is advised, but this is what's targeting your children in Target, Walmart, online, you name it.
[01:47:42.504 --> 01:47:44.146]  Stuff like this is being sold.
[01:47:44.146 --> 01:47:47.328]  The story is up on Infowars.com.
[01:47:47.328 --> 01:47:50.771]  Dragtots cartoon sparks outrage.
[01:47:50.771 --> 01:47:53.393]  Baby drag queen cartoon marketed to young children.
[01:47:54.093 --> 01:48:05.039]  Now, and they're actually modeled after some of these hideous looking obese men that we've seen in New York and everywhere that they roll out at story time for little kids.
[01:48:05.039 --> 01:48:10.461]  And we've played the video where they're like, you're going to be a drag queen, shake your butt, you know, do all this.
[01:48:10.461 --> 01:48:15.924]  And then they sexualize the children, paint them up, tell them that there's something else.
[01:48:15.924 --> 01:48:19.066]  And then they had the Drag Queen Festival this year here in Austin.
[01:48:19.066 --> 01:48:22.608]  It showed little children as young as two toddling up
[01:48:23.308 --> 01:48:31.710]  And putting money in the g-string of obese men wearing weds.
[01:48:31.710 --> 01:48:39.491]  I mean, it'd be bad enough if the guys actually looked like women, but it's a celebration of hideousness.
[01:48:39.491 --> 01:48:41.872]  And that's all part of this plan.
[01:48:41.872 --> 01:48:46.453]  And so this is being done everywhere, and they're sexualizing children.
[01:48:46.453 --> 01:48:48.133]  It is completely outrageous.
[01:48:50.262 --> 01:48:57.387]  It's never too early to slip into your first pair of heels, contour your cheekbones, and learn the basics of drag culture.
[01:48:57.387 --> 01:49:01.730]  Reads an announcement for Drag Tots, an upcoming cartoon about baby drag queens.
[01:49:01.730 --> 01:49:02.471]  See?
[01:49:02.471 --> 01:49:03.772]  How do you sexualize children?
[01:49:03.772 --> 01:49:04.732]  This is how you do it.
[01:49:04.732 --> 01:49:15.360]  And the event in Austin, I mean, we can show it, was men twerking, obese men twerking, and show it, show it, in front of small children.
[01:49:18.004 --> 01:49:21.807]  And we've got men pole dancing and shaking their butts in children's face.
[01:49:21.807 --> 01:49:26.290]  Here, let's show TV viewers when the little children run up and give them the money.
[01:49:26.290 --> 01:49:30.574]  So, would you take a three-year-old to the Yellow Rose here in Austin, Texas?
[01:49:30.574 --> 01:49:32.555]  That's a straight strip club.
[01:49:32.555 --> 01:49:35.377]  I mean, I'm personally not my cup of tea.
[01:49:35.377 --> 01:49:36.798]  I've been in college.
[01:49:36.798 --> 01:49:40.561]  One time Joe Rogan wanted to go, like, 18 years ago we went.
[01:49:40.561 --> 01:49:41.782]  Yeah, I've been to topless bars.
[01:49:41.782 --> 01:49:42.322]  Been to plenty of them.
[01:49:42.322 --> 01:49:42.743]  Don't like them.
[01:49:44.123 --> 01:49:46.665]  But I'm not condemning people to want to go to them.
[01:49:46.665 --> 01:50:03.013]  But the point is, is that if I saw people at a strip club with a two-year-old sticking a $10 bill in a woman's g-string, I'd walk up and say, what the hell is your problem?
[01:50:03.013 --> 01:50:12.498]  But when they do it, and by the way, there's some photos we put in the video that I don't even know if I should show, like children naked with only glitter on their bodies next to men with only glitter on their genitals.
[01:50:13.962 --> 01:50:17.605]  And I mean, you talk about a freak show, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:50:17.605 --> 01:50:19.526]  I mean, this is the culture.
[01:50:19.526 --> 01:50:23.449]  This is the cult of sexualizing children.
[01:50:23.449 --> 01:50:27.592]  And children practicing, you know, strip teases.
[01:50:27.592 --> 01:50:29.434]  You know, I can't look, I'm getting money for it.
[01:50:29.434 --> 01:50:30.654]  Take it down, take it down.
[01:50:30.654 --> 01:50:34.738]  This is truly an abomination.
[01:50:34.738 --> 01:50:37.520]  But see, oh, because it's gay or it's liberal, it's okay.
[01:50:37.520 --> 01:50:40.422]  This is, just like the guy got busted this week,
[01:50:41.505 --> 01:50:44.426]  Running the big children's charity for abused and kidnapped children.
[01:50:44.426 --> 01:50:49.207]  And he was trying to have sex with a two-year-old and admitted he had sex with small children.
[01:50:49.207 --> 01:50:50.327]  He's pled guilty.
[01:50:50.327 --> 01:50:53.527]  I mean, he's admitted that he's had any... Oh, what's the symbol?
[01:50:53.527 --> 01:50:55.348]  The Disney symbol.
[01:50:55.348 --> 01:50:56.788]  But rainbow.
[01:50:56.788 --> 01:51:03.049]  And, oh, we're just sexualizing your kid so they're not sexist or they're not homophobic.
[01:51:03.049 --> 01:51:05.550]  Meanwhile, he'd like to have sex with your two-year-old daughter.
[01:51:07.571 --> 01:51:09.815]  But see, he runs the human rights operation.
[01:51:09.815 --> 01:51:12.058]  He oversees.
[01:51:12.058 --> 01:51:14.082]  And see, everyone's equal.
[01:51:14.082 --> 01:51:18.348]  So if a man wants to have sex with a two-year-old, doesn't matter if it rips their guts out, I'm gonna do it, because it's liberal.
[01:51:19.974 --> 01:51:21.875]  Now, watch this cartoon.
[01:51:21.875 --> 01:51:25.458]  Your radio listener, the drag queens have sharp teeth, they're like demons.
[01:51:25.458 --> 01:51:26.679]  Ah, hi kids!
[01:51:26.679 --> 01:51:28.340]  Put on panties!
[01:51:28.340 --> 01:51:29.100]  Ah, yeah!
[01:51:29.100 --> 01:51:31.062]  Here, learn to shake your butt for the men!
[01:51:31.062 --> 01:51:31.942]  Ah, yeah!
[01:51:31.942 --> 01:51:33.103]  You're another sex now!
[01:51:33.103 --> 01:51:33.684]  Hi!
[01:51:33.684 --> 01:51:35.585]  We're not introducing Satanism or anything to ya!
[01:51:35.585 --> 01:51:37.566]  This isn't like when people were in satanic rituals.
[01:51:37.566 --> 01:51:38.467]  Outfits like clowns!
[01:51:38.467 --> 01:51:38.927]  No!
[01:51:38.927 --> 01:51:40.929]  This is so much better than in Hollywood!
[01:51:42.250 --> 01:51:43.832]  Sure, we hope your economy collapses.
[01:51:43.832 --> 01:51:44.913]  Sure, drink some fluoride.
[01:51:44.913 --> 01:51:46.795]  We're sorry you didn't get aborted when you were born.
[01:51:46.795 --> 01:51:49.899]  Or just being nice to everybody and socializing with kids and being friendly.
[01:51:49.899 --> 01:51:52.702]  So, let's go ahead and watch Drag Tots.
[01:51:52.702 --> 01:51:53.183]  Here it is.
[01:51:58.655 --> 01:52:00.515]  Roxy, moron!
[01:52:00.515 --> 01:52:03.377]  Why do you have so many books, sis?
[01:52:03.377 --> 01:52:07.678]  Oh, Corny, I heard the library was open because we got a big reading assignment.
[01:52:07.678 --> 01:52:08.899]  Whoa!
[01:52:08.899 --> 01:52:11.820]  Whoops!
[01:52:11.820 --> 01:52:13.581]  Well, that's using your head.
[01:52:13.581 --> 01:52:16.762]  Gone with the weave?
[01:52:16.762 --> 01:52:18.063]  Story of my life.
[01:52:18.063 --> 01:52:22.244]  All Quiet on the Western Lace Front at Moby Tuck.
[01:52:22.244 --> 01:52:25.546]  The Diva Rules by Michelle Visage.
[01:52:25.546 --> 01:52:26.546]  Talk about fiction.
[01:52:29.219 --> 01:52:35.065]  Roxy, it's not that kind of a reading assignment.
[01:52:35.065 --> 01:52:38.648]  Reading is part of our drag herstory.
[01:52:38.648 --> 01:52:42.512]  It's how queens communicate and tease each other.
[01:52:42.512 --> 01:52:45.295]  Said with love.
[01:52:45.295 --> 01:52:46.656]  Most of the time.
[01:52:46.656 --> 01:52:48.738]  You're not a true queen until you can read.
[01:52:48.738 --> 01:52:49.999]  Because reading is what?
[01:52:49.999 --> 01:52:51.301]  Fundamental.
[01:52:55.077 --> 01:53:01.081]  Drag tots, the sexualization of toddlers, which Nickelodeon set as their goal ten years ago.
[01:53:01.081 --> 01:53:05.785]  They said, we brought kids to sexualization at ten, we're going to do it at five.
[01:53:05.785 --> 01:53:08.066]  And then they had people dressed up like horrific demon.
[01:53:08.066 --> 01:53:11.168]  I'd have seen that when I was a kid, I'd have run for the hills.
[01:53:11.168 --> 01:53:14.631]  And it's the total exploitation.
[01:53:15.964 --> 01:53:28.994]  The total weaponization of media used to have, oh, I'm going to be an astronaut, or a doctor, or a nurse, or a scientist, or a farmer, or a police officer, or a firefighter, or, you know, I'm going to be an explorer, or I'm going to help poor children, I'm going to be a school teacher.
[01:53:28.994 --> 01:53:29.935]  No!
[01:53:29.935 --> 01:53:32.717]  Now, you're going to be a drag tot!
[01:53:32.717 --> 01:53:40.563]  And we're going to use the most hideous examples of this to absolutely break your will and make you accept all of it.
[01:53:40.563 --> 01:53:45.066]  And it's all Tavistock Institute in the UK, they're paying for young children to have their genitals cut off.
[01:53:46.147 --> 01:53:48.410]  So, you wanna know how society falls?
[01:53:48.410 --> 01:53:58.022]  The sickness, the decadence of Hollywood and the entertainment industry, and the fashion industry, like a weapon spewing pure death at everyone you know.
[01:53:58.022 --> 01:53:59.043]  And just, ah, see?
[01:53:59.043 --> 01:54:00.665]  It's all just, ah, ah!
[01:54:00.665 --> 01:54:02.507]  Hey, pull up to Satanist, where they're in the Daily Mail.
[01:54:03.248 --> 01:54:05.790]  How they dress in their rituals, and it's outfits like that.
[01:54:05.790 --> 01:54:09.532]  Just all crazy and scary and everyone, Hi kids!
[01:54:09.532 --> 01:54:10.693]  Hi!
[01:54:10.693 --> 01:54:13.135]  Hi, I'm gonna teach you about your sex.
[01:54:13.135 --> 01:54:16.577]  Normally it'd be when you're 10 or 11 years old, your parents would tell you the basics.
[01:54:16.577 --> 01:54:21.021]  But that's okay, you're 4 years old, you're 3 years old, I'm gonna teach you now.
[01:54:21.021 --> 01:54:21.681]  Okay?
[01:54:21.681 --> 01:54:24.623]  Here, I'm gonna teach you how it is.
[01:54:24.623 --> 01:54:26.484]  I'm Epstein's Hercules.
[01:54:31.873 --> 01:54:32.974]  Yeah, it is!
[01:54:32.974 --> 01:54:35.235]  We're gonna catch you and do whatever we want!
[01:54:35.235 --> 01:54:36.356]  It's all about us!
[01:54:36.356 --> 01:54:37.517]  You can't belong to us!
[01:54:48.286 --> 01:55:05.413]  Show the story times from Austin, Texas to New York City where they take two-year-olds and there will be obese, bizarre-looking crazy men with vampire fangs and devil horns going, I like to teach you about how you're gonna be a girl if you're a boy or a boy if you're a girl.
[01:55:05.413 --> 01:55:08.054]  And we're putting chemicals in the water to help with everything.
[01:55:10.160 --> 01:55:14.223]  It's a lot easier for Hirono to bring down this third dimension scoundrel.
[01:55:14.223 --> 01:55:16.584]  We're gonna destroy you!
[01:55:16.584 --> 01:55:22.168]  You will ascend to hell in the reverse order!
[01:55:22.168 --> 01:55:23.709]  Oh, I get it.
[01:55:23.709 --> 01:55:24.850]  Oh, you're so enlightened.
[01:55:24.850 --> 01:55:28.213]  You're so powerful!
[01:55:28.213 --> 01:55:29.413]  You're weak.
[01:55:29.413 --> 01:55:30.614]  We've been asleep.
[01:55:30.614 --> 01:55:31.495]  And now we're awake.
[01:55:31.495 --> 01:55:37.259]  And now you can feel the spirit of Christ re-entering the planet as you panic.
[01:55:38.587 --> 01:55:45.490]  And all of your... Look how weak and slobberlish and pathetic and chicken-necked all their servants are.
[01:55:45.490 --> 01:55:46.430]  Sucked!
[01:55:46.430 --> 01:55:48.991]  Soul-sucked fallen slaves!
[01:55:48.991 --> 01:55:52.673]  But behind them is always the Dracula's.
[01:55:52.673 --> 01:55:55.554]  And they now know fear.
[01:55:55.554 --> 01:56:00.376]  Because we're coming like the villagers in the night with the torches burning bright with fire.
[01:56:02.148 --> 01:56:04.829]  Fire is not the weapon of evil.
[01:56:04.829 --> 01:56:13.152]  Fire is the weapon of good, and it will consume you.
[01:56:13.152 --> 01:56:16.473]  Yes.
[01:56:16.473 --> 01:56:19.054]  Yes, you don't have to fear your God.
[01:56:19.054 --> 01:56:21.655]  You need to fear God.
[01:56:21.655 --> 01:56:23.735]  Your God has stolen your soul.
[01:56:23.735 --> 01:56:28.197]  Your God took away the key that you gave it.
[01:56:29.718 --> 01:56:47.380]  And now you stare into the fathomless depths of eternal phantom zone destruction and you want to take as many children with you down that hole as you can so you can clutch their souls as you fall towards the dark heart of that black hole.
[01:56:50.879 --> 01:56:55.423]  Soon the icy cold of hell will embrace you forever.
[01:56:55.423 --> 01:57:10.335]  Soon you will pass through and on, never to return to this dimension, never to ascend, but down, down, down, down, down, down, down into that black hole you're going, chained.
[01:57:10.335 --> 01:57:14.718]  And by the way, you think God's gonna let you get all those kids, that's why you try to corrupt them so early?
[01:57:14.718 --> 01:57:16.700]  You're not gonna be even able to do that.
[01:57:17.830 --> 01:57:24.832]  Many of the children you've abused will be the strongest people ever that will turn against you and bring you down.
[01:57:24.832 --> 01:57:28.973]  Because from the foundations of the earth, you are losers!
[01:57:28.973 --> 01:57:33.394]  And you are always to be there to test the righteous.
[01:57:33.394 --> 01:57:44.537]  Hour number three, your phone calls to people that faced the Antifa hordes in Portland and more in the pre-4th of July operation that is the InfoWar.

[01:58:42.163 --> 01:58:44.685]  And I think it's going to be the same way with this fiber.

[01:58:48.396 --> 01:58:54.761]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[01:58:54.761 --> 01:58:57.983]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.
[01:58:57.983 --> 01:59:01.686]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[01:59:01.686 --> 01:59:06.390]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[01:59:06.390 --> 01:59:09.652]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[01:59:10.533 --> 01:59:21.539]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[01:59:21.539 --> 01:59:30.083]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of Actum ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the Actum ingredients.
[01:59:31.704 --> 01:59:33.526]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:04.733 --> 02:00:07.756]  Well, here we are, July 5th, 2018.
[02:00:07.756 --> 02:00:15.683]  Another epic July 4th has come and gone, and never has it been more clear where the stakes are for humanity.
[02:00:15.683 --> 02:00:16.964]  But I want to make a point.
[02:00:16.964 --> 02:00:20.027]  There's a Churchill quote, I'm paraphrasing it, that
[02:00:21.337 --> 02:00:23.359]  Many people get hit by history.
[02:00:23.359 --> 02:00:32.045]  They get run over in the street by huge, big, epic developments and they kind of dust themselves off and ignore the point in history that they're in.
[02:00:32.045 --> 02:00:40.112]  But there are other people that get hit by destiny and hit by history and they get up and it changes the course of their lives and countless other people's lives.
[02:00:41.553 --> 02:00:56.614]  And so I want people to remember that the hundreds of millions that died under communism and the tens of millions that died under fascism and other cults and permutations of governmental control and societal mental illness manifest by government debt
[02:00:57.895 --> 02:01:16.062]  We are on the precipice of a new global revolution, a new renaissance, and we're actually, because of other people's work before us, shitting on a great brain trust of human liberty, and that we've got a chance to fight for freedom when the odds are actually on our side if we realize it.
[02:01:16.062 --> 02:01:18.743]  We've got to look back on those that didn't have a chance to win.
[02:01:19.775 --> 02:01:29.437]  But took action and did what was right because it was about their soul and about the spiritual, cultural, human decision they were making.
[02:01:29.437 --> 02:01:31.718]  And that's why they were fulfilled.
[02:01:31.718 --> 02:01:34.738]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:01:34.738 --> 02:01:36.198]  I want to thank you all for your prayers.
[02:01:36.198 --> 02:01:41.040]  I want to thank you all for what you've done against the bullies and the peer pressure over the years.
[02:01:41.040 --> 02:01:47.701]  Because if it wasn't for you, and if it wasn't for everything you've done, we wouldn't be here.
[02:01:49.284 --> 02:01:53.621]  Many of those people aren't here today that stood up for what was right.
[02:01:55.609 --> 02:02:01.910]  But in their gut, they believed in you and they believed in me and they believed that we could build a better future.
[02:02:01.910 --> 02:02:03.651]  They had goodwill towards people.
[02:02:03.651 --> 02:02:08.872]  They didn't want to use the fact that they had more knowledge than the average person to control that person.
[02:02:08.872 --> 02:02:15.134]  They didn't want to use the fact that they understood how the game was played to then set up a little secret cabal and feed on people.
[02:02:15.134 --> 02:02:23.916]  They had the true vision of human empowerment and the true mastery to empower others and bring them to the next level.
[02:02:23.916 --> 02:02:24.736]  They were Christ-like.
[02:02:25.663 --> 02:02:25.923]  I think?
[02:02:43.820 --> 02:02:46.301]  And your awakening and the decisions you've made.
[02:02:46.301 --> 02:03:03.726]  So, I just want to tell you, as we've passed through this July 4th, 2018, as the globalists launch their riots, their attacks, and their lies, and their moralizing, that have good cheer, my friends, because we're living in a time and age when the devil knows the time is short.
[02:03:03.726 --> 02:03:06.166]  So, he sends the beast with wrath.
[02:03:06.166 --> 02:03:08.827]  And there are whole world government systems here, the mark of the beast.
[02:03:08.827 --> 02:03:11.128]  It's going to be a lot of trials, a lot of tribulations, but
[02:03:12.278 --> 02:03:16.581]  We know the truth and we know who wins and we know where this all goes.
[02:03:16.581 --> 02:03:24.747]  And so that's a very positive fact to understand.
[02:03:24.747 --> 02:03:28.090]  All that matters is what you stand for.
[02:03:28.090 --> 02:03:33.014]  All that matters is not being a coward and not feeding on people that aren't as smart as you.
[02:03:33.014 --> 02:03:34.495]  And the minute you realize that,
[02:03:35.572 --> 02:03:50.817]  You're in God's arms forever, and these Satanists, and these Crowleyites, and these Democrats, and these Chi-Coms, and all these control freaks who want to control reality, who want to try to become a God, because they merge with AI technology, they don't understand they already had a connection to God.
[02:03:50.817 --> 02:03:56.838]  They were already an expression of God's consciousness in the universe, and there was no need to ever even do that.
[02:03:56.838 --> 02:03:58.599]  But that's why we have free will.
[02:03:58.599 --> 02:04:02.200]  Some people will fall to the lower dimension.
[02:04:02.200 --> 02:04:04.721]  Some people will rise and ascend towards
[02:04:06.016 --> 02:04:09.097]  A communion and a reunification with Christ.
[02:04:09.097 --> 02:04:10.937]  And that's the big choice.
[02:04:10.937 --> 02:04:13.358]  And that's why I know you've made the right choice.
[02:04:13.358 --> 02:04:15.478]  You're not going to find Christ in these whorehouse churches.
[02:04:15.478 --> 02:04:21.560]  That's where the literal globalists run the operation via the World Council of Churches.
[02:04:21.560 --> 02:04:27.161]  But you're going to find the real Christ in your heart, seeking after God and saying, I want to be a good person.
[02:04:27.161 --> 02:04:28.321]  I want to be just.
[02:04:28.321 --> 02:04:29.162]  I want to be honorable.
[02:04:29.162 --> 02:04:30.482]  I'm going to tell the truth.
[02:04:30.482 --> 02:04:34.363]  So again, are those of us here, when we're seeing this great awakening of heroes,
[02:04:35.174 --> 02:04:47.318]  No, the heroes are those in communist China and North Korea and old Soviet Russia and countless other places like Cuba that were tortured and murdered and killed and watched their children go to prison because they didn't deny God the truth.
[02:04:47.318 --> 02:04:52.620]  And to them on this July 4th, I want to thank you all and thank you for 1776 Worldwide.
[02:04:52.620 --> 02:04:56.602]  God bless you all.

[02:06:12.754 --> 02:06:14.616]  All genitals are cut off!

[02:06:22.046 --> 02:06:23.287]  I can feel the spirit rising!
[02:06:23.287 --> 02:06:24.028]  Can't you?
[02:06:24.028 --> 02:06:26.050]  We have broken their back!
[02:06:26.050 --> 02:06:26.991]  Yes, I can feel it!
[02:06:26.991 --> 02:06:29.855]  Let's go!
[02:06:29.855 --> 02:06:37.804]  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!
[02:06:48.459 --> 02:06:52.804]  So, you've been on YouTube for years and you don't know who I am.
[02:07:13.317 --> 02:07:19.639]  I'm real, I know the enemy, and if we can have the spirit of normal humanity spread, it's over for the globalists!
[02:07:19.639 --> 02:07:23.440]  You'll never, never defeat the human spirit!
[02:07:23.440 --> 02:07:25.781]  You'll never defeat God!
[02:07:25.781 --> 02:07:27.081]  You'll never win!
[02:07:27.081 --> 02:07:32.283]  We know who they are, and we're sick of them!
[02:07:37.438 --> 02:07:39.160]  You guys know who he is?
[02:07:39.160 --> 02:07:43.526]  You know how Alex Jones says InfoWars?
[02:07:43.526 --> 02:07:44.267]  Very popular.
[02:07:44.267 --> 02:07:44.927]  Alex Jones.
[02:07:44.927 --> 02:07:45.668]  Alex Jones.
[02:07:45.668 --> 02:07:46.509]  Alex Jones.
[02:07:46.509 --> 02:07:47.170]  Alex Jones.
[02:07:47.170 --> 02:07:48.552]  Alex Jones for Alex Jones.
[02:07:48.552 --> 02:07:48.852]  Alex Jones.
[02:07:48.852 --> 02:07:49.753]  From InfoWars.
[02:07:49.753 --> 02:07:50.294]  InfoWars.
[02:07:50.294 --> 02:07:50.614]  Yeah.
[02:07:50.614 --> 02:07:52.056]  But did that stop him?
[02:07:52.056 --> 02:07:52.156]  No!
[02:07:52.156 --> 02:07:53.037]  It did not!
[02:07:54.568 --> 02:07:55.229]  Gone!
[02:07:55.229 --> 02:07:56.369]  Okay!
[02:07:56.369 --> 02:07:58.011]  And just, it went everywhere!
[02:07:58.011 --> 02:08:03.455]  The more they abuse you, the more you enjoy it, just like the Stockholm Syndrome!
[02:08:03.455 --> 02:08:06.437]  And so that's why the joke is on you!
[02:08:06.437 --> 02:08:08.759]  And that's why it's gonna continue!
[02:08:19.987 --> 02:08:22.568]  I know your mustache is gold!
[02:08:22.568 --> 02:08:27.509]  You got little gold-framed glasses!
[02:08:27.509 --> 02:08:32.430]  You scare me so bad!
[02:08:32.430 --> 02:08:38.652]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:48.254 --> 02:08:50.395]  We've got our guest coming up.
[02:08:50.395 --> 02:08:59.460]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[02:08:59.460 --> 02:09:09.185]  Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist who is apparently... Alex Jones!
[02:09:19.064 --> 02:09:25.146]  Reputation's amazing.
[02:09:25.146 --> 02:09:26.587]  I will not let you down.
[02:09:26.587 --> 02:09:29.488]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[02:09:34.734 --> 02:09:38.138]  You know why those intros say Alex Jones, Alex Jones so much?
[02:09:38.138 --> 02:09:49.629]  Because we can take even small radio stations that have no ratings and usually get them mid-level or high ratings within a year because that's how it works with Arbitron and all that is name recognition so you have to say the name over and over again.
[02:09:49.629 --> 02:09:51.832]  The radio stations like that because that's how they stay afloat.
[02:09:52.552 --> 02:09:55.673]  Okay, we are back live well into the third hour.
[02:09:55.673 --> 02:09:59.354]  Our guests will be riding shotgun with us for the hour, maybe a little bit longer.
[02:09:59.354 --> 02:10:00.355]  I know we've got loaded phones.
[02:10:00.355 --> 02:10:06.637]  We'll also pop in and get your calls on Mueller, on the liberals calling for revolution, all of it.
[02:10:09.335 --> 02:10:13.617]  Joey Gibson is the founder of the Patriot Prayer Group and is running for U.S.
[02:10:13.617 --> 02:10:14.537]  Senate as a Republican.
[02:10:14.537 --> 02:10:20.600]  Joey is fighting for freedom with the strength and power from God and love, gibsonforfreedom.com.
[02:10:20.600 --> 02:10:23.361]  And he goes out to these events.
[02:10:23.361 --> 02:10:24.442]  He just has prayer vigils.
[02:10:24.442 --> 02:10:27.003]  And the left gets really triggered by that and comes out.
[02:10:27.623 --> 02:10:29.004]  And they do it up and down the West Coast.
[02:10:29.004 --> 02:10:30.065]  Will Johnson also does it.
[02:10:30.065 --> 02:10:31.125]  UnitedAmericanFirst.com.
[02:10:31.125 --> 02:10:33.727]  What a great website, but even greater info he's involved in.
[02:10:33.727 --> 02:10:37.809]  He's a founder of the United American First, a movement that began during the 2016 election.
[02:10:37.809 --> 02:10:39.511]  And I've heard him talk on my show and others about it.
[02:10:39.511 --> 02:10:42.973]  He just kept seeing the lies and the race baiting and how evil it was.
[02:10:42.973 --> 02:10:45.414]  He just had this knot in his gut, this knot in his chest.
[02:10:45.414 --> 02:10:45.995]  I'm the same way.
[02:10:46.892 --> 02:10:50.715]  I can be totally exhausted, like eight at night, something big happens, and I just suddenly have all this energy.
[02:10:50.715 --> 02:10:51.976]  Like when they attack me, too.
[02:10:51.976 --> 02:10:53.577]  I don't like being attacked when I know they're lying.
[02:10:53.577 --> 02:10:57.400]  I suddenly... It doesn't make me get scared when they do these horrible things to me.
[02:10:57.400 --> 02:10:58.041]  It's the opposite.
[02:10:58.041 --> 02:10:59.462]  People say, oh, you're so brave.
[02:10:59.462 --> 02:11:01.403]  Brave?
[02:11:01.403 --> 02:11:04.345]  I'd really be brave if I just laid down and let these dogs chew my guts out.
[02:11:04.345 --> 02:11:05.006]  It's the opposite.
[02:11:05.006 --> 02:11:06.587]  I'm fighting for my life here.
[02:11:06.587 --> 02:11:07.408]  These people are evil!
[02:11:08.971 --> 02:11:10.672]  That's what we're talking about here.
[02:11:10.672 --> 02:11:12.953]  So, Will Johnson and Joey Gibson.
[02:11:12.953 --> 02:11:15.475]  Let's go to Will first, but jump in any time, Joey.
[02:11:15.475 --> 02:11:17.176]  Wow, what happened this weekend.
[02:11:17.176 --> 02:11:20.998]  Even the local news had to admit Antifa attacked first.
[02:11:20.998 --> 02:11:21.619]  Bottles.
[02:11:21.619 --> 02:11:22.479]  I mean, you were there.
[02:11:22.479 --> 02:11:25.141]  Tell folks what happened.
[02:11:25.141 --> 02:11:28.763]  You know, I want to thank you for having me on again.
[02:11:28.763 --> 02:11:31.745]  I'm thankful for Joey to invite me to his event.
[02:11:33.584 --> 02:11:34.965]  It was absolutely crazy.
[02:11:34.965 --> 02:11:36.306]  We were completely peaceful.
[02:11:36.306 --> 02:11:38.488]  DHS did a beautiful job.
[02:11:38.488 --> 02:11:40.329]  They did an awesome job.
[02:11:40.329 --> 02:11:41.990]  They protected all of us.
[02:11:41.990 --> 02:11:47.574]  When we were going into the event, we had to, if anyone had peppermints or anything like that, they had to give them to DHS.
[02:11:47.574 --> 02:11:53.138]  So we didn't have anything to protect ourselves from these Antifa domestic terrorist groups.
[02:11:53.138 --> 02:11:57.161]  But I want to, it was absolutely insane for what they were doing.
[02:11:57.161 --> 02:11:58.862]  It's just like Berkeley all over again.
[02:11:59.654 --> 02:12:07.577]  We go there, we're completely peaceful, we're Trump supporters, we're black, we're brown, we're white, we're all together, no one's fighting.
[02:12:07.577 --> 02:12:14.340]  It's only when we go out onto the streets where Antifa and the Portland Police didn't do their job to protect us.
[02:12:14.340 --> 02:12:21.763]  Well, that's in the Soros documents that they work with Blue City Police to stand down, even let them engage in violence.
[02:12:21.763 --> 02:12:26.765]  Joey, tell us about your prayer group, the events you've had, and why you think Antifa particularly attacks these.
[02:12:28.786 --> 02:12:36.671]  Yeah, so basically, you know, we started doing this because we saw people getting beat up in the streets during the Trump election down in San Jose.
[02:12:36.671 --> 02:12:55.524]  So the goal was to go out and just challenge it and expose them, but at the same time, you know, our rhetoric has always been about love and prayer and talking about God, yet these people come out of nowhere and they hate the freedom aspect, okay, because a lot of them are communists, and they seem to just really hate the message of God, like they despise it.
[02:12:56.586 --> 02:13:03.388]  They just come from all over the West Coast to whatever rally we're throwing and they're going to use violence and do whatever it takes to silence us.
[02:13:04.725 --> 02:13:08.047]  What was the big takeaway from this latest one, A, and then B?
[02:13:08.047 --> 02:13:08.527]  It's here.
[02:13:08.527 --> 02:13:09.427]  They say revolution.
[02:13:09.427 --> 02:13:11.008]  They say they're going to launch the attacks.
[02:13:11.008 --> 02:13:13.789]  There's arrests all over the country, attacks happening everywhere.
[02:13:13.789 --> 02:13:19.112]  Behind the scenes, I can't get to it yet on air, they have launched attacks against me and my family that are out of a Twilight Zone movie.
[02:13:19.112 --> 02:13:25.074]  I mean, I'm talking basically like intelligence agencies, but it's the Democratic Party and Soros.
[02:13:25.074 --> 02:13:26.675]  He's put $18 billion in.
[02:13:26.675 --> 02:13:28.776]  I mean, this is, the battle is really heating up.
[02:13:30.726 --> 02:13:32.226]  I would say there's two things to take from this.
[02:13:32.226 --> 02:13:38.869]  Number one, you know, we're at a point now, it's unfortunate, you know, I have a lot of respect for most of the police.
[02:13:38.869 --> 02:13:44.090]  I think most of the police officers, they want to do their job, but right now they're just standing down, especially in Portland, Oregon.
[02:13:44.090 --> 02:13:50.952]  And so I kind of want to make a call for these guys to make a conscientious decision to protect the Constitution, which is the First Amendment.
[02:13:50.952 --> 02:13:56.574]  If you get an order from someone above you that's asking you to go against the Constitution, you need to do what is right.
[02:13:57.054 --> 02:14:11.864]  The second thing I'm going to take from this is if the police are going to stand down and we're not going to have law and order, you're going to have patriots from all over the country come in and they're going to do their job like you saw on Saturday because they had Antifa, they had Sharp members running scared.
[02:14:11.864 --> 02:14:22.270]  There's that viral video where that Sharp member, you know, had a baton, went up against a guy, a proud boy who had nothing but his arm, you know, blocked it twice, hit him with one punch and he was out.
[02:14:22.270 --> 02:14:23.131]  He was done.
[02:14:23.131 --> 02:14:26.173]  And so I think patriots will begin to stand up and take back the streets.
[02:14:27.617 --> 02:14:38.161]  And again, I've watched hours of your videos, how they would throw the bottles, they would attack first, the police stood down, you guys would kick their butt, like Tommy Robinson fighting off nine guys himself, even though he's a little guy.
[02:14:38.161 --> 02:14:41.763]  Describe the essence of that, and then we're gonna go to break of what happened.
[02:14:44.918 --> 02:14:48.481]  So yeah, it's like, okay, we'll talk about June 3rd, for example.
[02:14:48.481 --> 02:14:51.684]  So that was the first Portland rally a few weeks ago.
[02:14:51.684 --> 02:14:57.450]  You have these Antifa kids chasing after families, people who can't really defend themselves.
[02:14:57.450 --> 02:15:04.857]  You look at Haley Adams and her family, they attacked them, you know, stole their property, beat them up because they saw them as an easy target.
[02:15:05.297 --> 02:15:07.659]  Same thing with an elderly man, Kerry Hudson.
[02:15:07.659 --> 02:15:08.900]  They went after them.
[02:15:08.900 --> 02:15:12.243]  Because they can't take on the real patriots willing to defend themselves.
[02:15:12.243 --> 02:15:19.550]  So June 30th comes along and there's all this rhetoric about how I'm not going to be able to show up because they're going to kill me, they're going to stab me.
[02:15:19.550 --> 02:15:24.054]  All this talk, they show up, they go running down the streets and the patriots just chase them.
[02:15:24.514 --> 02:15:25.414]  A whole block down.
[02:15:25.414 --> 02:15:28.136]  And we just showed dramatic footage we'll come back with again.
[02:15:28.136 --> 02:15:29.076]  You were there.
[02:15:29.076 --> 02:15:33.118]  I mean, you've got a guy with one of those extendable metal clubs.
[02:15:33.118 --> 02:15:35.538]  You can kill somebody with a police baton.
[02:15:35.538 --> 02:15:37.499]  Basically an extendable baton.
[02:15:37.499 --> 02:15:39.800]  They could break your bones, whipping it at you.
[02:15:39.800 --> 02:15:43.242]  And of course, they got fellow steps in and just boom!
[02:15:43.242 --> 02:15:45.322]  Total KO.
[02:15:45.322 --> 02:15:46.023]  Knockout.
[02:15:46.023 --> 02:15:46.723]  Boom!
[02:15:46.723 --> 02:15:48.424]  And the woman tries to attack you.
[02:15:48.424 --> 02:15:48.904]  That's their thing.
[02:15:48.904 --> 02:15:50.224]  They try to get women to attack you.
[02:15:50.224 --> 02:15:51.025]  So you got to defend yourself.
[02:15:51.025 --> 02:15:52.425]  And they go, oh, you attacked a woman.
[02:15:52.425 --> 02:15:53.926]  Well, yeah, you just got in a man's world, lady.

[02:16:55.063 --> 02:16:57.004]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:16:57.004 --> 02:17:02.306]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:17:02.306 --> 02:17:03.907]  But the symptoms are there.

[02:20:10.531 --> 02:20:13.171]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:20:13.171 --> 02:20:19.553]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:20:19.553 --> 02:20:28.375]  You know, I could make a movie called Cowards, or Yellow Bellies, with all the videos we've got the last 10 years of Antifa.
[02:20:30.031 --> 02:20:32.513]  They're beating up women, people in wheelchairs.
[02:20:32.513 --> 02:20:36.956]  They come out to Christian rallies and will run up and hit a woman in the back of the head.
[02:20:36.956 --> 02:20:40.618]  They are the archetypal weasel wench.
[02:20:40.618 --> 02:20:43.980]  And then you look at the average antifa, they're like a meth-head shriveled white kid.
[02:20:45.020 --> 02:20:48.662]  Or Professor, running around screaming about racist white people everywhere.
[02:20:48.662 --> 02:20:52.103]  They'll have the occasional mental patient or meth head.
[02:20:52.103 --> 02:20:58.446]  They show up with their clubs and weapons and then as soon as one of them gets knocked out, they always turn and run.
[02:20:58.446 --> 02:21:02.028]  And you'll see them target women with bike locks and a whole crowd do it.
[02:21:02.853 --> 02:21:03.453]  It's incredible.
[02:21:03.453 --> 02:21:12.560]  So we've got Will Johnson, who's with UnitedAmericanFirst.com, and Joey Gibson, who has these Christian prayer group rallies, where they're all-inclusive and just trying to have peace.
[02:21:12.560 --> 02:21:13.600]  And people come out and attack.
[02:21:13.600 --> 02:21:16.742]  As they said a few weeks ago in Portland, they attacked men, women, children.
[02:21:16.742 --> 02:21:21.826]  Hell, in Berkeley, they attacked Millie Weaver and her husband and baby and attacked their car.
[02:21:21.826 --> 02:21:24.447]  I've told Millie don't go out there without security, but she still does.
[02:21:24.447 --> 02:21:25.688]  She's got a lot of courage.
[02:21:25.688 --> 02:21:29.911]  But the fact that you have to go out, these families try to go to Fourth of July parades.
[02:21:29.911 --> 02:21:31.992]  They just caught a guy trying to blow it up in Cleveland.
[02:21:32.913 --> 02:21:35.155]  Toy cars with bombs in it.
[02:21:35.155 --> 02:21:39.078]  It's just the level of the hate and the insanity.
[02:21:39.078 --> 02:21:41.319]  And this guy they just arrested.
[02:21:41.319 --> 02:21:45.002]  Document cam shot on this guy if we can, or maybe pull it up on Infowars.com.
[02:21:45.002 --> 02:21:49.406]  Man who threatened to murder Rand Paul's children is an Obama-supporting Berkeley resident.
[02:21:50.518 --> 02:21:52.820]  And again, he's wearing women's glasses.
[02:21:52.820 --> 02:22:01.107]  He looks like, you know, he probably couldn't bench-press 50 pounds, but he talks about, I'm gonna kidnap, I'm gonna murder your children, I'm gonna cut their guts out, then I'm gonna murder you.
[02:22:01.107 --> 02:22:02.388]  He's facing 10 years in prison.
[02:22:02.388 --> 02:22:05.090]  Turns out on his Twitter, I went and looked up his Twitter.
[02:22:05.090 --> 02:22:07.652]  He was in there for weeks threatening all the Republicans.
[02:22:07.652 --> 02:22:09.293]  He goes, look at my hit list.
[02:22:09.293 --> 02:22:11.155]  I've death-threatened all these people.
[02:22:12.449 --> 02:22:16.731]  So, finally, Rand Paul has been shot at with Scalise.
[02:22:16.731 --> 02:22:20.193]  He has been six of his ribs broken, a lung punctured.
[02:22:20.193 --> 02:22:23.795]  You know how painful that is for six weeks when you've had ribs broken?
[02:22:23.795 --> 02:22:24.255]  I've had it.
[02:22:24.255 --> 02:22:24.816]  Nothing like that.
[02:22:24.816 --> 02:22:25.956]  Never had a lung punctured.
[02:22:25.956 --> 02:22:30.439]  I mean, that guy caved him in, attacked him, jumped up and down on him, trying to kill him.
[02:22:31.678 --> 02:22:33.879]  Okay, he's not even getting in hardly any trouble.
[02:22:33.879 --> 02:22:35.539]  And now this guy wants to kill him.
[02:22:35.539 --> 02:22:38.060]  And then Rand Paul's actually a libertarian anti-war guy.
[02:22:38.060 --> 02:22:41.460]  The left's so crazed, they don't even know who to hate.
[02:22:41.460 --> 02:22:44.041]  So, it's unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:22:44.041 --> 02:22:52.243]  So getting back to Joey Gibson, Joey, describe what it's like when these cowards come up with metal batons, really trying to kill you.
[02:22:52.243 --> 02:22:55.764]  And then folks are knocking them out with one punch, and then the rest of the cowards run.
[02:22:55.764 --> 02:22:58.925]  They're so tough, till one of them gets hit, they all turn and run.
[02:22:58.925 --> 02:22:59.985]  The definition of scum.
[02:23:01.798 --> 02:23:02.599]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:23:02.599 --> 02:23:08.802]  And that's why it's really important that we unite, we come together, we come together in mass numbers and just have each other's backs.
[02:23:08.802 --> 02:23:15.286]  Because the only way they can really win is if we fall apart, we divide, we get people to go off on their own.
[02:23:15.286 --> 02:23:20.909]  And that's exactly what happened at Hayley's Addams Family, which they had the courage to do it, but they crossed the street wearing MAGA hats.
[02:23:21.349 --> 02:23:23.871]  Which that's their right to do, you know?
[02:23:23.871 --> 02:23:30.115]  They went across the street and they confronted Antifa and then they just started attacking her father, her mother, her sister.
[02:23:30.115 --> 02:23:33.818]  They held down Haley and stole their property right in front of the police.
[02:23:33.818 --> 02:23:34.959]  And so, they'll do that.
[02:23:34.959 --> 02:23:36.019]  They'll act real tough.
[02:23:36.019 --> 02:23:41.063]  There's a lot of them who act tough, but the second they gotta go toe-to-toe with any patriot, man, they start running.
[02:23:41.063 --> 02:23:43.645]  You know, they get one punch and they're done.
[02:23:43.645 --> 02:23:49.869]  And so, you know, unfortunately, the only thing they can do is try to find a victim, someone who can't defend themselves.
[02:23:49.869 --> 02:23:50.570]  Well, I know this.
[02:23:53.197 --> 02:23:57.100]  I've seen the videos of them coming up and attacking women in strollers and stuff.
[02:23:57.100 --> 02:23:58.701]  These women need to be packing, man.
[02:23:58.701 --> 02:24:02.584]  Thugs are assaulting women, they need to defend themselves.
[02:24:02.584 --> 02:24:03.805]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:24:03.805 --> 02:24:06.947]  Will Johnson, what do you say to that?
[02:24:06.947 --> 02:24:10.790]  You know, we shouldn't have to be afraid to go out as Americans.
[02:24:10.790 --> 02:24:15.554]  Every time we have a rally, a conservative rally, a Christian rally, a pro-Trump rally,
[02:24:16.321 --> 02:24:30.724]  Every single time, nine times out of ten, we will get Antifa, BLM, BAM, and now the Brown Berets in California to be aggressive to us, to attack us, simply because we respect the American flag, withstand to the national anthem.
[02:24:30.724 --> 02:24:38.586]  This fighting is all due to the Democrats, and I'm calling the Democrats domestic terrorists.
[02:24:38.586 --> 02:24:41.647]  They are 100% domestic terrorist group in the United States.
[02:24:41.647 --> 02:24:43.207]  You have Maxine Waters calling
[02:24:44.116 --> 02:24:48.419]  For violence towards conservatives, anyone who's on the Trump administration.
[02:24:48.419 --> 02:24:54.985]  Can you imagine had this happened if Obama was in office and you had a Republican do this?
[02:24:54.985 --> 02:25:00.549]  It would be a- If a Republican was saying, rise up, surround them, beat people up, I'd say hell no.
[02:25:00.549 --> 02:25:02.771]  I mean, exactly.
[02:25:02.771 --> 02:25:03.932]  They call us Nazis.
[02:25:03.932 --> 02:25:06.494]  This is exactly how Hitler came to power with the brown shirts.
[02:25:06.494 --> 02:25:07.675]  They did this exact same thing.
[02:25:08.857 --> 02:25:10.019]  Yes, exactly.
[02:25:10.019 --> 02:25:12.444]  And we have to experience this every single time.
[02:25:12.444 --> 02:25:14.368]  We're 100% peaceful.
[02:25:14.368 --> 02:25:16.712]  We were at Joey's Rally and 100% peaceful.
[02:25:16.712 --> 02:25:17.714]  Everyone getting along.
[02:25:17.714 --> 02:25:20.379]  It wasn't until we went out in the streets to where we had.
[02:25:22.188 --> 02:25:24.409]  Amazing.
[02:25:24.409 --> 02:25:35.031]  Cameras don't catch it all, but describe what it's like when these antifa come up and try to basically kill you with metal pipes and are swinging for the fences and then one of them gets hit and they all run.
[02:25:35.031 --> 02:25:36.572]  I mean, what is that like?
[02:25:36.572 --> 02:25:39.952]  It looks very exhilarating when the guy just... I want to give that guy an award.
[02:25:39.952 --> 02:25:43.093]  Do we know who that guy is that just cold cocked that guy that tried to kill him with a club?
[02:25:43.093 --> 02:25:45.394]  I mean, that is just... that's the real deal right there.
[02:25:49.310 --> 02:25:49.812]  Yeah, it's Rufio.
[02:25:49.812 --> 02:25:50.977]  He's a proud boy.
[02:25:50.977 --> 02:25:53.871]  He's in Washington, up in the Seattle area.
[02:25:54.648 --> 02:25:57.089]  Real big dude, works out all the time, and he has a big heart.
[02:25:57.089 --> 02:25:58.530]  He's a really good guy.
[02:25:58.530 --> 02:26:06.033]  And we appreciate him standing in there and sticking up for all the people who are marching, you know, the women and the elderly, and just standing up like a real man.
[02:26:06.033 --> 02:26:08.594]  That's the spirit that we got to have in this country.
[02:26:08.594 --> 02:26:09.334]  I agree.
[02:26:09.334 --> 02:26:11.035]  I want to get him on, because let me say this.
[02:26:11.035 --> 02:26:13.916]  Notice it took one man to stand up to those thugs.
[02:26:13.916 --> 02:26:14.836]  They all ran.
[02:26:14.836 --> 02:26:15.757]  One man.
[02:26:15.757 --> 02:26:19.458]  They're all up there sticking their chest out with their clubs, with their maces, with their weapons.
[02:26:19.458 --> 02:26:22.839]  It took one guy to stand up and knock them upside the head, and they all ran.
[02:26:22.839 --> 02:26:24.100]  I mean, isn't that archetypal?
[02:26:26.075 --> 02:26:27.796]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:26:27.796 --> 02:26:32.939]  And it really represents, you know, that's the true American spirit right there, right?
[02:26:32.939 --> 02:26:34.560]  It's about, it's no fear.
[02:26:34.560 --> 02:26:36.441]  It's just standing up for what you believe in.
[02:26:36.441 --> 02:26:39.283]  And that's what the whole rally was about, the Freedom and Courage Rally.
[02:26:39.283 --> 02:26:45.667]  It's about, you know, it takes courage to really stand up for freedom, to get freedom, and that's it right there.
[02:26:45.667 --> 02:26:48.469]  It represents it, and to just see him stand up to him.
[02:26:48.469 --> 02:26:52.911]  And he had no hesitation, and that's what I love, and that's what I appreciate it, and it was completely justified.
[02:26:52.911 --> 02:26:53.872]  It's all self-defense.
[02:26:54.432 --> 02:26:57.437]  And so we, you know, he pretty much became a hero overnight.
[02:26:57.437 --> 02:26:57.938]  That's right.
[02:26:57.938 --> 02:26:59.080]  You should have seen him.
[02:26:59.080 --> 02:27:00.562]  He drove back with us to the bar.
[02:27:00.562 --> 02:27:05.049]  He walked up to the bar and the whole bar just started chanting his name because it was all over the country.
[02:27:05.049 --> 02:27:06.131]  And again, say his name again.
[02:27:07.389 --> 02:27:08.810]  His name's Rufio.
[02:27:08.810 --> 02:27:09.872]  Ethan Rufio.
[02:27:09.872 --> 02:27:11.373]  We need to get him on ASAP.
[02:27:11.373 --> 02:27:13.435]  And it's not because he attacked somebody.
[02:27:13.435 --> 02:27:17.699]  He showed up to five or six guys waving weapons at him, and then they all turned and ran.
[02:27:17.699 --> 02:27:18.600]  That's what it's all about.
[02:27:18.600 --> 02:27:20.302]  It's not striking first.
[02:27:20.302 --> 02:27:21.723]  And that's my big concern, guys.
[02:27:21.723 --> 02:27:31.113]  I'm worried they've been caught, you know, obviously trying to stage that whole clash with the police ordering the new right folks, that I don't agree with a lot of what they have to say, into the Antifa scum.
[02:27:31.994 --> 02:27:34.899]  And Trump was right to condemn both sides, but the police made them clash.
[02:27:34.899 --> 02:27:36.823]  It's come out, the police stood down.
[02:27:36.823 --> 02:27:40.750]  I'm concerned they're going to pull more of that than try to get a big race war going.
[02:27:40.750 --> 02:27:41.531]  What do you think, Will?
[02:27:43.055 --> 02:27:45.037]  Yeah, I completely agree with you.
[02:27:45.037 --> 02:27:54.566]  When we were walking down, Portland police, they actually saw Antifa and the America supporters, I like to call them, facing off.
[02:27:54.566 --> 02:27:57.289]  And they did nothing to prevent what took place.
[02:27:57.289 --> 02:27:59.451]  You know, we are in a civil war.
[02:27:59.451 --> 02:28:02.634]  It's not a hot civil war, but the Democrats are pushing for a racial
[02:28:03.614 --> 02:28:05.355]  They're pushing for a racial war.
[02:28:05.355 --> 02:28:10.877]  And my main goal is to stop that because we should not be fighting each other based on one's complexion.
[02:28:10.877 --> 02:28:13.638]  They are literally trying to destroy the United States.
[02:28:13.638 --> 02:28:14.498]  They're so bitter.
[02:28:14.498 --> 02:28:17.619]  They're so angry because Donald J. Trump is the president.
[02:28:17.619 --> 02:28:21.100]  And every time we have these rallies, we have to be on the guard.
[02:28:21.100 --> 02:28:32.244]  People, women come out with helmets on, come out with full metal jacket gear on because they want to avoid the violence with these Antifa domestic terrorists that's the foot soldiers for the Democrats.
[02:28:33.900 --> 02:28:39.782]  That's right, and they're getting ready to launch their big attack.
[02:28:39.782 --> 02:28:41.342]  You can feel it, you can see it.
[02:28:41.342 --> 02:28:44.243]  One of our gentlemen's running for Senate, not just launching these prayer vigils.
[02:28:44.243 --> 02:28:46.883]  Our other friend's going up and down the West Coast exposing all this.

[02:30:56.192 --> 02:31:03.751]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that
[02:31:05.333 --> 02:31:16.182]  When you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other materiel from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[02:31:16.182 --> 02:31:18.284]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[02:31:18.284 --> 02:31:22.287]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:31:22.287 --> 02:31:29.453]  And I want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine.
[02:31:29.453 --> 02:31:31.935]  And you cannot beat that for children and adults.

[02:31:35.037 --> 02:31:35.998]  I think so.
[02:31:56.906 --> 02:32:01.489]  Patrick, in the great nation of Australia, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:32:01.489 --> 02:32:02.050]  Thanks for calling.
[02:32:02.050 --> 02:32:03.471]  Hey Alex, mate.
[02:32:03.471 --> 02:32:07.093]  I've been following you since I was 14, and I'm 32 now.
[02:32:07.093 --> 02:32:15.819]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen, and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet, and I thought it was
[02:32:15.959 --> 02:32:32.143]  Pretty cool, and read all the books, and seen all the DVDs, and followed all your guests, and I've been using your products since the first iteration of Survival Shield, and since then I'm on the X2, the Supermail Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, Micro ZX Body, it's all amazing.
[02:32:32.623 --> 02:32:41.210]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[02:32:41.210 --> 02:32:46.114]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[02:32:46.114 --> 02:32:59.264]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1776 Worldwide.
[02:32:59.264 --> 02:33:01.926]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:28.450 --> 02:33:32.912]  Bill Johnson of UnitedAmericaFirst.com and Joey Gibson, GibsonForFreedom.com.
[02:33:32.912 --> 02:33:41.616]  You know, you got people that are taught by the media that your hero should be football players or basketball players, and I like a football game or a basketball game, and I'm sorry.
[02:33:41.616 --> 02:33:50.100]  Roger Stolbeck, Terry Bradshaw, LeBron James, Muhammad Ali, those are not my heroes.
[02:33:50.100 --> 02:33:51.220]  Okay?
[02:33:51.220 --> 02:33:55.362]  They're interesting, you can admire them for their prowess, great, but it's moral courage.
[02:33:56.607 --> 02:34:05.452]  And standing up against the peer pressure, and the attacks, and the demonizations, and the threats, and being shot at, and having your ribs broken, and being shot.
[02:34:05.452 --> 02:34:06.253]  And I'm not bitching.
[02:34:06.253 --> 02:34:07.934]  Hell, people say, man, how do you take all this?
[02:34:07.934 --> 02:34:09.495]  Well, these are bad people.
[02:34:09.495 --> 02:34:10.936]  I'm biting them because I know they're bad.
[02:34:10.936 --> 02:34:13.297]  Now, they've proven I was right.
[02:34:13.297 --> 02:34:17.340]  But, I mean, at a certain point, you just can't keep rolling over.
[02:34:17.340 --> 02:34:21.322]  But I got to tell you, I don't like going out around antifa.
[02:34:21.322 --> 02:34:25.104]  I first learned who they were like 15 years ago, anti-fascist, anti-racist, and a guy
[02:34:27.220 --> 02:34:28.161]  Steve Mason.
[02:34:28.161 --> 02:34:28.942]  He's still in Austin.
[02:34:28.942 --> 02:34:31.604]  He's an interesting guy.
[02:34:31.604 --> 02:34:34.686]  He was a leftist, but he was really an anti-racist.
[02:34:34.686 --> 02:34:37.549]  And when he was going to college up in Maine, he's an older guy.
[02:34:37.549 --> 02:34:39.230]  We should find Steve Mason's number.
[02:34:39.230 --> 02:34:39.850]  I've got it somewhere.
[02:34:39.850 --> 02:34:40.351]  Get him in here.
[02:34:40.351 --> 02:34:42.352]  And he was like the preeminent expert.
[02:34:42.352 --> 02:34:44.634]  He had this show called Texas Frontline.
[02:34:44.634 --> 02:34:48.958]  He'd say, the communists are now called the anti-racist, anti-fascist group, blah, blah, blah.
[02:34:48.958 --> 02:34:53.361]  And I would go, those are the guys that always come up and hit me in the back when I'm doing a rally for Second Amendment.
[02:34:53.361 --> 02:34:54.222]  He goes, yeah, yeah, those are them.
[02:34:55.205 --> 02:35:19.950]  And they're like all professors, and they're funded by big banks and all this, and boy was he a trailblazer in writing about this, and he predicted the whole communist underground being prepared, and for in the future they were going to launch all this, and then they were going to collapse the borders for the UN, and the world population operation, and now the UN is saying, we're going to occupy the EU, and we're going to stop nation states stopping tens of millions pouring in,
[02:35:21.326 --> 02:35:23.287]  And they had a plan under Hillary to bring the U.N.
[02:35:23.287 --> 02:35:23.787]  in.
[02:35:23.787 --> 02:35:25.188]  That's in the Associated Press.
[02:35:25.188 --> 02:35:41.577]  So when you pull back and see this giant thing they're launching, decades in the making, thank God, populism from South America to areas of Africa to Asia to strong in Eastern Europe, the Brexit and out in the Atlantic Ocean.
[02:35:41.577 --> 02:35:44.959]  It's like humanity isn't getting coordinated when the FBI is questioned.
[02:35:46.178 --> 02:35:47.579]  Hundreds of people now about me.
[02:35:47.579 --> 02:35:49.780]  They keep saying, how does Jones know what Trump's going to say?
[02:35:49.780 --> 02:35:52.582]  How does Jones, is Jones talking to Trump every day?
[02:35:52.582 --> 02:35:53.822]  Who's the mastermind?
[02:35:53.822 --> 02:35:54.723]  And they're really doing this.
[02:35:54.723 --> 02:35:55.203]  They don't get it.
[02:35:55.203 --> 02:35:56.344]  It's like a spirit.
[02:35:56.344 --> 02:35:59.125]  They've got their evil spirit, the mystery of evil, the Bible talks about.
[02:35:59.125 --> 02:36:05.569]  I remember reading this when I was a kid and in Bible study, I thought, really, there's like an evil thing that coordinates and that's the mystery of evil, how it works.
[02:36:05.569 --> 02:36:07.730]  And then God's got his own Holy Spirit.
[02:36:07.730 --> 02:36:09.511]  But when you actually get to this level,
[02:36:10.555 --> 02:36:19.463]  It's like we're all coordinated, they're all coordinated, but they're coordinated digitally and with commands and orders and propaganda and also a spirit of hate.
[02:36:19.463 --> 02:36:20.324]  But there's a real spirit.
[02:36:20.324 --> 02:36:24.288]  So since I know both you guys are Christians, so am I. I'm not some guy up here on a high horse.
[02:36:24.288 --> 02:36:27.831]  I just love God, love Christ, and that's what gives me my strength.
[02:36:27.831 --> 02:36:28.952]  Joey, you're a Christian.
[02:36:28.952 --> 02:36:33.396]  What makes you, and we're going to go to calls with both you guys, what made you understand you had to do this?
[02:36:33.396 --> 02:36:33.957]  I mean, was it a
[02:36:34.557 --> 02:36:55.295]  Not in your chest like Will talked about, because that's what it is with me, and then almost like a burning up my spine, and then in my mind, like, it's in my gut starts here, and then it's like I gotta do something, because it's not like I gotta go be a champion or hero, it's like evil's coming on me, I gotta do something, and I've seen Will talk about that feeling, you know, you know evil when you see it, can you speak to the spiritual element of this?
[02:36:56.785 --> 02:37:00.668]  Actually Alex, a big part of this story has to do with you.
[02:37:00.668 --> 02:37:03.589]  I've always been awake in terms of the corruption in our government.
[02:37:03.589 --> 02:37:10.413]  I've always been a libertarian constitutionalist and I started to listen to you for a while and I really watched a lot of your shows.
[02:37:10.413 --> 02:37:18.278]  The one thing you kept pushing is that you can't just listen to your show, you have to go out and participate and you kept pushing that and pushing that and pushing that and it really spoke to me.
[02:37:18.838 --> 02:37:23.879]  And what had happened is a bunch of people got beat up in San Jose when they're leaving a Trump rally.
[02:37:23.879 --> 02:37:25.280]  And at that point, I was done.
[02:37:25.280 --> 02:37:26.840]  Like, I was done sitting in my house.
[02:37:26.840 --> 02:37:28.120]  I didn't know what I was going to do.
[02:37:28.120 --> 02:37:29.801]  But I'm going to go out there and participate.
[02:37:29.801 --> 02:37:33.061]  And it was a spiritual journey for me.
[02:37:33.061 --> 02:37:38.323]  And the first thing I did is I booked my tickets and I went down to Cleveland to the RNC, which you were at.
[02:37:38.323 --> 02:37:39.823]  And I went to your rally.
[02:37:39.823 --> 02:37:40.623]  I heard you speak.
[02:37:40.623 --> 02:37:42.064]  You know, I shook your hand.
[02:37:42.064 --> 02:37:47.285]  And I came back home a completely different person and just completely committed to making change in this culture.
[02:37:47.805 --> 02:37:55.912]  The one thing I said in my speech is that if you see evil, clear as day, which I was seeing, and you do nothing and you say nothing, then you're just as much to blame.
[02:37:55.912 --> 02:37:57.754]  So I refuse to stand down.
[02:37:57.754 --> 02:37:58.895]  That's pretty much it right there.
[02:37:58.895 --> 02:38:00.316]  That's beautiful.
[02:38:00.316 --> 02:38:02.918]  Tell us your story, Will.
[02:38:02.918 --> 02:38:05.300]  You know, I truly believe we're in a civil war.
[02:38:05.300 --> 02:38:06.942]  And I have to admit to something.
[02:38:08.204 --> 02:38:12.047]  Brainforce actually works for people who don't realize.
[02:38:12.047 --> 02:38:12.987]  I mean, it actually works.
[02:38:12.987 --> 02:38:20.092]  So when I would go to these rallies, I would pop to Brainforce and I was just right on it every single time, knocking them out.
[02:38:20.092 --> 02:38:21.513]  The liberals are confronting them.
[02:38:21.513 --> 02:38:23.974]  The Brainforce absolutely works.
[02:38:23.974 --> 02:38:25.235]  I can say it firsthand.
[02:38:26.392 --> 02:38:29.795]  But this spiritual war that we're in, it is a battle.
[02:38:29.795 --> 02:38:37.862]  And just like Joey said, I used to listen to you, you say, people, you've got to speak up, you've got to do your own videos, do your own podcast, do those, do those.
[02:38:37.862 --> 02:38:44.528]  And that not, because you were doing that, that not actually just got bigger in my chest and I had to speak out.
[02:38:44.528 --> 02:38:47.991]  So I'm in complete agreement with Joey and what you just said.
[02:38:49.028 --> 02:38:52.211]  And the reason we tell those stories is that's all happened to us at one time or another.
[02:38:52.211 --> 02:38:55.594]  And then you guys inspire me, I inspire you, we all inspire each other.
[02:38:55.594 --> 02:39:04.242]  And then we show, like when we had the rally, our rally at Cleveland, I was so proud that more than half that crowd wasn't white.
[02:39:04.242 --> 02:39:09.827]  And that everybody loved each other, everybody was hugging, they were Hispanic, black folks, Asians, white guys, white bikers.
[02:39:11.808 --> 02:39:16.010]  You know, guys with their Iron Cross tattoos on their arms, you know, hugging black folks.
[02:39:16.010 --> 02:39:19.831]  And I see Trump and the Tea Party and all this healing.
[02:39:19.831 --> 02:39:23.532]  It's actually, the most loving place you can go is to a Tea Party event or a Trump event.
[02:39:23.532 --> 02:39:26.534]  That is the most open, people have light in their eyes, they're good.
[02:39:26.534 --> 02:39:31.575]  You go to a leftist event, again, I'm not putting them down, they look like somebody sucked their soul.
[02:39:31.575 --> 02:39:32.976]  This is spiritual is what I'm saying.
[02:39:34.511 --> 02:39:35.071]  Exactly.
[02:39:35.071 --> 02:39:44.455]  When I went to the Kevin de Leon and I confronted him about why is he putting illegals before the American people, I was the only black male in the room.
[02:39:44.455 --> 02:39:47.816]  And then they all looked demonic and they all started attacking me.
[02:39:47.816 --> 02:39:50.538]  They were yelling at me saying it's not true.
[02:39:50.538 --> 02:39:54.359]  And it is absolutely true that he's putting the illegals before the American citizen.
[02:39:54.359 --> 02:39:58.981]  That's why we're in a predicament that we're in right now with the borders and with the immigration situation.
[02:39:59.796 --> 02:40:05.602]  This war that we're in is not just about left and right Democrats and Republicans.
[02:40:05.602 --> 02:40:07.404]  It is a spiritual war.
[02:40:07.404 --> 02:40:12.349]  And they're trying to create, they're trying to bring this war that we're having to a hot war in America.
[02:40:12.349 --> 02:40:17.154]  And I truly believe, like I said before, we are in the second civil war in this nation.
[02:40:17.754 --> 02:40:20.275]  I agree, you've been saying that for a year that I've seen your videos.
[02:40:20.275 --> 02:40:25.717]  As we cross over, I think they're trying to go hot right now, but none of them want to get the full blame.
[02:40:25.717 --> 02:40:29.999]  Moore is willing to say it, Maxine, and the way I respect them is they're willing to say it.
[02:40:29.999 --> 02:40:32.780]  But they're really, I see them launching it right now.
[02:40:32.780 --> 02:40:35.041]  The numbers are pouring in, the attacks are all over the place.
[02:40:36.587 --> 02:40:37.789]  Yes, they are.
[02:40:37.789 --> 02:40:50.506]  I mean, Maxine Waters gave the okay to Antifa, BAM, BLM, and the Brown Berets, or anybody who doesn't agree with the Trump administration to go out and attack them, to approach them.
[02:40:50.506 --> 02:40:51.467]  When they're simply having
[02:40:51.527 --> 02:40:51.987]  That's right.
[02:40:51.987 --> 02:40:57.931]  And MSNBC has a host I played earlier saying, Oh, Sarah Sanders gets a life sentence.
[02:40:57.931 --> 02:41:00.873]  She's not allowed to be comfortable anywhere.
[02:41:00.873 --> 02:41:01.953]  Chase her down everywhere.
[02:41:01.953 --> 02:41:03.454]  I mean, that is, that is so brown shirt.
[02:41:16.084 --> 02:41:16.384]  It is 100%.
[02:41:16.384 --> 02:41:24.188]  They complain and say that Trump is the neo-Nazi supporter, that he's a white supremacist.
[02:41:24.188 --> 02:41:30.331]  Both Joey and I were called white supremacists by Nancy Pelosi.
[02:41:30.331 --> 02:41:35.774]  Everything that they do, that they say they're against, that's exactly what they do.
[02:41:35.774 --> 02:41:38.996]  It's unbelievable.
[02:41:38.996 --> 02:41:40.136]  I can feel the energy.
[02:41:40.136 --> 02:41:42.478]  I mean, they're losing, but they're freaking out.
[02:41:42.478 --> 02:41:44.819]  I think in the next few weeks, I think we're going to see some real violence.
[02:41:46.543 --> 02:41:47.044]  I agree.
[02:41:47.044 --> 02:41:47.864]  You know what?
[02:41:47.864 --> 02:41:51.788]  That's why I'm constantly screaming, we have to vote them out.
[02:41:51.788 --> 02:41:55.071]  Because if we don't vote them out in 2018, we all lose.
[02:41:55.071 --> 02:41:56.872]  It doesn't matter if you're Republican, Democrat.
[02:41:56.872 --> 02:41:57.893]  Will, you made a great point.
[02:41:57.893 --> 02:42:02.798]  They've proven they're a criminal, globalist, CHICOM-funded organization that wants to overthrow the country.
[02:42:02.798 --> 02:42:06.281]  We have to get rid of the Democratic Party and create a new party.
[02:42:06.281 --> 02:42:06.801]  Absolutely.
[02:42:06.801 --> 02:42:09.284]  The Democratic Party is a domestic terrorist group.
[02:42:09.284 --> 02:42:10.705]  They're promoting violence.
[02:42:11.241 --> 02:42:12.342]  A hundred percent.
[02:42:12.342 --> 02:42:16.687]  Their foot soldiers is Antifa, BLM, BAM, and the Brown Berets.
[02:42:16.687 --> 02:42:18.830]  A hundred percent.
[02:42:18.830 --> 02:42:19.951]  Wow.
[02:42:19.951 --> 02:42:20.672]  Joey, we're going to break.
[02:42:20.672 --> 02:42:21.313]  You want to say something?
[02:42:22.173 --> 02:42:23.074]  Yeah, something real quick.
[02:42:23.074 --> 02:42:26.175]  Just, uh, I know we don't have much time, but we gotta break through the lies.
[02:42:26.175 --> 02:42:31.518]  There's this attempt to make us think that there's not conservatives out there, there's not this huge shit.
[02:42:31.518 --> 02:42:33.780]  One thing we can do is show up in the streets.
[02:42:33.780 --> 02:42:39.083]  August 4th, we're going back into Portland, and the safest thing we can do is to just bring thousands of people.
[02:42:39.083 --> 02:42:39.683]  I agree.
[02:42:39.683 --> 02:42:41.344]  August 4th, we're gonna send reporters.
[02:42:41.344 --> 02:42:42.265]  Hell, I'm not even come.
[02:42:42.845 --> 02:42:46.329]  They've just got me pinned down here with stuff you wouldn't believe.
[02:42:46.329 --> 02:42:47.069]  I'm not complaining.
[02:42:47.069 --> 02:42:48.050]  I expected this to happen.
[02:42:48.050 --> 02:42:50.413]  Good God, these people are dirty.
[02:42:50.413 --> 02:42:51.734]  They are on my butt, let me tell you.
[02:42:51.734 --> 02:42:53.195]  They're going after everybody in my family.
[02:42:53.195 --> 02:42:53.596]  We'll be back.
[02:42:55.267 --> 02:43:05.869]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[02:43:05.869 --> 02:43:07.929]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[02:43:07.929 --> 02:43:10.790]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[02:43:10.790 --> 02:43:12.290]  It's made in the USA.
[02:43:12.290 --> 02:43:19.112]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[02:43:19.112 --> 02:43:20.332]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[02:43:21.192 --> 02:43:30.900]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[02:43:30.900 --> 02:43:47.712]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[02:43:47.712 --> 02:43:50.875]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[02:43:51.015 --> 02:43:55.178]  Now it's time to change our bodies with a Z-Shield at InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:43:55.178 --> 02:43:59.121]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[02:43:59.121 --> 02:44:02.423]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[02:44:02.423 --> 02:44:08.688]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[02:44:08.688 --> 02:44:11.470]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[02:44:12.190 --> 02:44:16.013]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[02:44:16.013 --> 02:44:22.477]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[02:44:22.477 --> 02:44:27.461]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[02:44:28.191 --> 02:44:32.132]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[02:44:32.132 --> 02:44:39.315]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[02:44:39.315 --> 02:44:44.537]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[02:44:44.537 --> 02:44:50.219]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[02:44:50.219 --> 02:44:54.200]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[02:44:56.533 --> 02:44:58.474]  This 4th of July is special.
[02:44:58.474 --> 02:45:00.475]  Everybody can see it, they can feel it.
[02:45:00.475 --> 02:45:04.917]  The globalists are attempting to kill a worldwide awakening to their tyranny.
[02:45:04.917 --> 02:45:09.279]  And America, yet again, is at the heart of the resistance of the globalists.
[02:45:09.279 --> 02:45:14.381]  That's why this 4th of July I'm asking all of our great supporters to think about Infowars now more than ever.
[02:45:14.381 --> 02:45:18.123]  And what would the world be like if Infowars wasn't there resisting the globalists?
[02:45:18.983 --> 02:45:21.265]  What would have happened if you hadn't supported InfoWars?
[02:45:21.265 --> 02:45:23.207]  We would not be having the victories we have today.
[02:45:23.207 --> 02:45:26.370]  So yes, a lot of good things are happening, but the enemy is striking back.
[02:45:26.370 --> 02:45:33.516]  So please, think about InfoWars and funding our operation while you get great products at the same time on the 4th of July that's so historic.
[02:45:33.516 --> 02:45:35.377]  We have record sales going on right now.

[02:45:56.454 --> 02:46:00.438]  Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home.
[02:46:00.438 --> 02:46:03.181]  But sometimes supplements don't work fast enough.
[02:46:03.181 --> 02:46:07.986]  That's why InfoWars Life has created a powerful new addition to the Super Blue line.
[02:46:07.986 --> 02:46:10.408]  Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle.

[02:46:40.526 --> 02:46:42.127]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:21.835 --> 02:47:23.959]  I've got a big announcement here ladies and gentlemen.
[02:47:23.959 --> 02:47:26.042]  I'm very very excited about it.
[02:47:26.042 --> 02:47:26.322]  You saw
[02:47:28.061 --> 02:47:36.570]  Dan Rather come out and, you know, demonize me and attack what we're doing here at InfoWars and call us fake news.
[02:47:36.570 --> 02:47:37.991]  But, you know, he's the fake news.
[02:47:37.991 --> 02:47:43.998]  And he also recently came out and said that Trump is mean like a wolverine.
[02:47:43.998 --> 02:47:45.639]  So earlier this week, I said, hey,
[02:47:46.300 --> 02:47:49.603]  Let's put out Trump as a Wolverine.
[02:47:49.603 --> 02:47:52.846]  MeanLikeAWolverineInfoWars.com.
[02:47:52.846 --> 02:47:54.967]  Beautiful new red shirt.
[02:47:54.967 --> 02:47:57.550]  Incredible job with the graphics crew.
[02:47:57.550 --> 02:48:00.012]  They are amazing.
[02:48:00.012 --> 02:48:00.172]  1995.
[02:48:00.172 --> 02:48:01.513]  High quality shirt.

[02:48:03.495 --> 02:48:05.476]  They'll be shipping out next week.
[02:48:05.476 --> 02:48:06.637]  Get your order in.
[02:48:06.637 --> 02:48:07.938]  This is a limited edition.
[02:48:07.938 --> 02:48:10.160]  This needs to be the new viral shirt.
[02:48:12.802 --> 02:48:17.666]  I think on another idea today, and we've got printing right here in Texas now, so we can get this by next week as well.
[02:48:17.666 --> 02:48:20.568]  I just put in a giant order.
[02:48:20.568 --> 02:48:25.372]  Because I saw Walmart boycott launched over Impeach45 clothing.
[02:48:25.372 --> 02:48:27.173]  Don't boycott Walmart over that.
[02:48:27.173 --> 02:48:29.254]  Just say Walmart.
[02:48:29.254 --> 02:48:30.676]  I don't care if they copy our shirt.
[02:48:30.676 --> 02:48:33.498]  Put out a reelect 45.
[02:48:33.498 --> 02:48:35.019]  You know, let's engage in that.
[02:48:37.119 --> 02:48:38.440]  So, they've got their Impeach45.
[02:48:38.440 --> 02:48:40.621]  You go to Infowarsstore.com.
[02:48:40.621 --> 02:48:46.745]  We have Reelect45 with an American flag, very triggering, on the right arm and on the back.
[02:48:46.745 --> 02:48:48.606]  Infowars.com.
[02:48:48.606 --> 02:48:52.549]  I am the resistance.
[02:48:52.549 --> 02:48:55.871]  I am the resistance.
[02:48:55.871 --> 02:48:57.732]  This, I mean, these shirts have just been hitting me.
[02:48:57.732 --> 02:48:59.954]  And I knew Hillary for President.
[02:48:59.954 --> 02:49:02.976]  I saw a handmade sign in a yard.
[02:49:04.460 --> 02:49:07.704]  About, you know, like three years before the election.
[02:49:07.704 --> 02:49:09.146]  They knew she'd run.
[02:49:09.146 --> 02:49:11.970]  And then I remember thinking, or two years before, I was like, we've got to do that.
[02:49:11.970 --> 02:49:15.434]  And we went to the RNC, and a third of the people were wearing it.
[02:49:15.434 --> 02:49:16.175]  It was the chance.
[02:49:17.222 --> 02:49:20.704]  It was, we had planes flying around saying it, behind them, it was incredible.
[02:49:20.704 --> 02:49:21.985]  It was a magic moment.
[02:49:21.985 --> 02:49:24.446]  And I know when something's going to be a hit.
[02:49:24.446 --> 02:49:30.769]  So, they've got their Impeach 45, Re-elect 45, baseball shirt style, white, blue, and red.
[02:49:30.769 --> 02:49:31.570]  Red, white, and blue.
[02:49:31.570 --> 02:49:33.631]  And then black on white, I am the resistance.
[02:49:34.631 --> 02:49:35.852]  It's an awesome shirt.
[02:49:35.852 --> 02:49:36.733]  $19.95.
[02:49:36.733 --> 02:49:38.515]  High quality fabric.
[02:49:38.515 --> 02:49:39.396]  Made right here in America.
[02:49:39.396 --> 02:49:40.697]  Printed in America.
[02:49:40.697 --> 02:49:43.079]  It's costing six, seven bucks to do that in America.
[02:49:43.079 --> 02:49:44.761]  We do it for three bucks in Mexico.
[02:49:44.761 --> 02:49:45.782]  So it's there.
[02:49:45.782 --> 02:49:46.863]  Help fund the operation.
[02:49:46.863 --> 02:49:47.424]  Reelect45.

[02:49:50.747 --> 02:49:51.888]  And mean like a wolverine.
[02:49:56.653 --> 02:49:59.854]  These shirts are both so good, I don't know which one's gonna be a best-seller.

[02:50:06.635 --> 02:50:07.615]  Well, why is it 60 bucks?
[02:50:07.615 --> 02:50:09.575]  There's like $10 a product in this.
[02:50:09.575 --> 02:50:11.936]  I'll just make it even stronger and sell it for $30.
[02:50:11.936 --> 02:50:13.036]  When it's discounted, it's like $19.95.

[02:50:28.443 --> 02:50:34.688]  Will Johnson, Joey Gibson, gibsonforfreedom.com, running for Senate, unitedamericanfirst.com.
[02:50:34.688 --> 02:50:38.751]  I've been a bad boy, so every caller I don't get to gets a free t-shirt of their choice.
[02:50:38.751 --> 02:50:40.272]  That's a rule, it's my job more than an hour.
[02:50:40.272 --> 02:50:41.554]  I've been a bad person.
[02:50:41.554 --> 02:50:42.454]  I apologize, everybody.
[02:50:42.454 --> 02:50:44.136]  Let's go to some calls right now.
[02:50:44.136 --> 02:50:47.098]  Preston in the great state of Missouri, then Brad and others.
[02:50:47.098 --> 02:50:48.039]  Thanks for holding your own here.
[02:50:49.301 --> 02:50:57.026]  Alex, thank you for taking my call, and thank you as well as the crew for the amazing fight you put up against the New World Order and globalism every day.
[02:50:57.026 --> 02:50:59.007]  I want to plug your products real quick.
[02:50:59.007 --> 02:51:01.108]  I've bought pretty much all of your products.
[02:51:01.108 --> 02:51:02.689]  Use many of them daily.
[02:51:02.689 --> 02:51:03.930]  Use others incrementally.
[02:51:03.930 --> 02:51:12.976]  I do need a family and friends who are struggling with health, and thank you for making it easy to support the tip of the spear in the cultural war.
[02:51:14.412 --> 02:51:15.232]  I want to thank you.
[02:51:15.232 --> 02:51:15.833]  I want to thank you.
[02:51:15.833 --> 02:51:17.013]  We're in this together, brother.
[02:51:17.013 --> 02:51:18.034]  I know you know this.
[02:51:18.034 --> 02:51:21.196]  When you realize how they're truly evil, it's not like thanking each other.
[02:51:21.196 --> 02:51:22.616]  We're fighting for our lives here, brother!
[02:51:22.616 --> 02:51:25.118]  Absolutely right.
[02:51:25.118 --> 02:51:26.418]  I agree.
[02:51:26.418 --> 02:51:29.000]  On to my 9-11 complaint question.
[02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:34.843]  We know 9-11 was an inside job conducted by criminal elements fell out within our government.
[02:51:34.843 --> 02:51:36.684]  Pretty much all the evidence shows that.
[02:51:36.684 --> 02:51:39.365]  9-11 is what woke me up personally.
[02:51:39.365 --> 02:51:42.607]  You producing loose change among many other things.
[02:51:43.528 --> 02:51:54.731]  In my opinion, 9-11 is the Pandora's box, the skeleton key to open up the doors to the globalist New World Order for those who are still asleep.
[02:51:54.731 --> 02:52:09.615]  So, my question on Trump's 9-11 stance is if whoever gets to take back control of the deep state, the people who were, you know, behind 9-11, needed to be brought to their knees, put in prison, or worse, how do you see it pointing out
[02:52:10.555 --> 02:52:12.376]  I'm very interested in your answer here.
[02:52:12.376 --> 02:52:15.537]  How do you see it going on with Rudy Giuliani being Trump's lawyer?
[02:52:28.565 --> 02:52:33.189]  If you bring out full 9-11, which Trump would like to do, it will tank the stock market.
[02:52:33.189 --> 02:52:35.772]  There will be a civil war on our side.
[02:52:35.772 --> 02:52:44.259]  It's kind of like a thing in war where if the enemy surrenders, you let them basically leave and go live on an island, like with Napoleon.
[02:52:44.259 --> 02:52:45.200]  It's been found to be better.
[02:52:48.256 --> 02:52:54.300]  9-11 did have Islamic involvement, but there were criminal elements working with it to stand down and all the rest of it and bombs the buildings.
[02:52:54.300 --> 02:52:55.361]  And so Trump knows that.
[02:52:55.361 --> 02:52:56.182]  He said that at the time.
[02:52:56.182 --> 02:52:57.262]  That's why he's attacked.
[02:52:57.262 --> 02:53:02.726]  And now he's letting the deep state know, I'll play the ace card, ace of spades, if you try this, OK?
[02:53:02.726 --> 02:53:04.827]  And so I trust the president on this.
[02:53:04.827 --> 02:53:10.991]  I'm the one that got, I'm not going to get into it all, but the president's ready to move and he intends to bring it all out in good time.
[02:53:10.991 --> 02:53:12.553]  That's a very complex issue, though.
[02:53:12.553 --> 02:53:14.554]  I mean, Trump is the president now, Will.
[02:53:14.554 --> 02:53:15.915]  Trump's the president, Joey.
[02:53:15.915 --> 02:53:17.536]  He knows all this damning stuff.
[02:53:18.116 --> 02:53:22.002]  He's kind of giving them rope, and I'm not saying he should cover anything up, but there's so much dirt.
[02:53:22.002 --> 02:53:26.447]  If he made it all about that, we would go into a civil war.
[02:53:26.447 --> 02:53:31.054]  So there's a real wisdom to this, and I'm lined up with Trump's discernment.
[02:53:31.054 --> 02:53:33.036]  And so I'm just taking it one step at a time.
[02:53:33.036 --> 02:53:33.477]  What do you think?
[02:53:37.089 --> 02:53:40.413]  My opinion is that we get the job done.
[02:53:40.413 --> 02:53:41.173]  We get results.
[02:53:41.173 --> 02:53:44.136]  I've seen, you know, you look at what's happening in Saudi Arabia.
[02:53:44.136 --> 02:53:48.461]  I was always uncomfortable how friendly we've been with them, especially the Bushes.
[02:53:48.461 --> 02:53:51.343]  And I was uncomfortable with how friendly Trump is with them.
[02:53:51.343 --> 02:53:54.647]  But if you look at it, they're arresting people massively.
[02:53:54.647 --> 02:53:56.829]  And it looks like things are being cleaned up.
[02:53:56.829 --> 02:53:58.270]  Oh, he's kicking that whole group out.
[02:53:58.270 --> 02:53:59.792]  Yeah.
[02:53:59.792 --> 02:54:00.573]  So I just want results.
[02:54:01.462 --> 02:54:02.362]  Well, exactly.
[02:54:02.362 --> 02:54:06.543]  And look, look, we've already been lied to about bombs in the buildings and all this, whatever happened.
[02:54:06.543 --> 02:54:11.045]  The point is, if Trump can get the people that did it out of power, put some in prison, that's great.
[02:54:11.045 --> 02:54:12.265]  I'm not saying cover it up.
[02:54:12.265 --> 02:54:15.726]  I'm just saying, how do we bring this out?
[02:54:15.726 --> 02:54:18.947]  I was just trying to expose the conspirators so we get a good government to stop it.
[02:54:18.947 --> 02:54:21.147]  But something this bad, how do you bring that out?
[02:54:21.147 --> 02:54:25.588]  That's what I'm asking, Joey and Will.
[02:54:25.588 --> 02:54:27.609]  You know, one of the things is... Go ahead.
[02:54:29.978 --> 02:54:33.279]  I was going to say, one of the things is, all you have to do is ask about Building 7.
[02:54:33.279 --> 02:54:37.201]  As soon as you ask about Building 7, they all shut down.
[02:54:37.201 --> 02:54:43.023]  And you know one thing I hear, Alex, I hear a lot of people always talking about Infowars and conspiracy theories, but you know what?
[02:54:43.023 --> 02:54:44.903]  You've always been correct.
[02:54:44.903 --> 02:54:47.224]  I've yet to see them disprove what you're saying.
[02:54:47.224 --> 02:54:49.685]  I mean, you talk about news today.
[02:54:50.465 --> 02:54:52.406]  That's going to happen tomorrow.
[02:54:52.406 --> 02:55:01.252]  And then it becomes, you know, reality and they don't understand how was it possible that you're coming up with this information like you have the inside track to all of it.
[02:55:01.252 --> 02:55:02.172]  And they don't like it.
[02:55:02.172 --> 02:55:05.974]  That's why you get these talk shows attacking you the way they do.
[02:55:05.974 --> 02:55:07.775]  It's unbelievable.
[02:55:07.775 --> 02:55:09.376]  The big secret is I'm not that smart.
[02:55:09.376 --> 02:55:12.998]  The globalists communicate in publications with each other and admit all this.
[02:55:12.998 --> 02:55:15.200]  And then with us, they treat us like we're morons.
[02:55:15.200 --> 02:55:16.521]  It's just crazy.
[02:55:16.521 --> 02:55:17.741]  I'm going to jam in one more call.
[02:55:17.741 --> 02:55:18.722]  Are you going to say something, Joey?
[02:55:20.245 --> 02:55:24.787]  I would also say maybe we should trust the strength of the public more than we do.
[02:55:24.787 --> 02:55:26.528]  I think that we can't handle the truth.
[02:55:26.528 --> 02:55:33.690]  And so I've just understood that when you lie to the public all the time, we tend to like, you know, we become too sensitive.
[02:55:33.690 --> 02:55:36.291]  So I say the truth is great for the country.
[02:55:36.291 --> 02:55:37.372]  No, I hear you.
[02:55:37.372 --> 02:55:41.093]  And I've not pushed Trump to bring out 9-11 just because I wasn't even thinking about it.
[02:55:41.093 --> 02:55:42.574]  And then I don't want to brag or anything.
[02:55:45.620 --> 02:55:46.080]  Yes, sir.
[02:56:05.061 --> 02:56:07.182]  These guys are in a lot of trouble, man.
[02:56:07.182 --> 02:56:08.904]  I can't believe how good Trump is, though.
[02:56:08.904 --> 02:56:12.686]  My gut, my spirit tells me he's good, but I keep getting paranoid, like, is this really happening?
[02:56:12.686 --> 02:56:13.706]  What do you guys think about that?
[02:56:13.706 --> 02:56:18.970]  I mean, at a gut, spiritual level, what do you, when you ask Christ about Trump, what do you get back?
[02:56:18.970 --> 02:56:21.131]  I get back, this is my wrecking ball, get out of the way.
[02:56:22.879 --> 02:56:26.303]  I think Trump is what this country needed this day and time.
[02:56:26.303 --> 02:56:27.885]  This 100%.
[02:56:27.885 --> 02:56:28.927]  I'm still thankful.
[02:56:28.927 --> 02:56:34.353]  Thank God that Donald J. Trump is our president and not the Hilda Beetz, Hillary Clinton.
[02:56:34.353 --> 02:56:36.336]  She would have destroyed everything.
[02:56:36.336 --> 02:56:38.298]  The Democrats are on a path to destroy the state.
[02:56:38.298 --> 02:56:38.979]  They're Satanists.
[02:56:38.979 --> 02:56:40.201]  They can't do anything but destroy.
[02:56:41.169 --> 02:56:43.250]  Yes, and that is their plan.
[02:56:43.250 --> 02:56:44.770]  That's what they want to do.
[02:56:44.770 --> 02:56:48.271]  And I think, you know, what we're doing, we're trying to expose all of that.
[02:56:48.271 --> 02:56:54.713]  When I went to the cafe in Oakland, the whole point was to expose the hatefulness, the evilness of the left, 100%.
[02:56:54.713 --> 02:56:56.894]  God, they're so hateful.
[02:56:56.894 --> 02:56:57.734]  What happened to the left, though?
[02:56:57.734 --> 02:56:58.474]  Because I was younger.
[02:56:58.474 --> 02:57:01.415]  There were a lot of nice hippies, liberals that were smart about stuff that was right.
[02:57:01.415 --> 02:57:03.716]  They didn't have that spirit.
[02:57:03.716 --> 02:57:05.596]  There were some bad Republicans and bad Democrats.
[02:57:05.596 --> 02:57:09.217]  It was kind of a mix, but something happened along the way with Democrats.
[02:57:09.217 --> 02:57:10.718]  I think just the media weaponized them.
[02:57:12.458 --> 02:57:16.140]  I think personally, I think Satan realized his time is short.
[02:57:16.140 --> 02:57:18.602]  So he's trying to work on these people to destroy.
[02:57:18.602 --> 02:57:23.565]  You've got to go faster and faster to do as much as you can to destroy this nation.
[02:57:23.565 --> 02:57:25.846]  Time is wasting according to them.
[02:57:25.846 --> 02:57:32.030]  If Satan went to the DNC and was talking to the Democrats, which policy would the Democrats disagree with?
[02:57:32.030 --> 02:57:32.770]  None of them.
[02:57:32.770 --> 02:57:34.371]  They would agree with all of them.
[02:57:34.571 --> 02:57:35.031]  We'll be back!
[02:57:50.202 --> 02:57:52.563]  The Real Red Pill Plus, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:57:52.563 --> 02:57:55.984]  Our team is constantly on the lookout for newer and better ways to improve our products.
[02:57:55.984 --> 02:58:03.007]  That's why we're bringing you a brand new version of one of the newest fan favorite products, The Real Red Pill Plus.
[02:58:03.007 --> 02:58:07.848]  The Real Red Pill Plus is an all new version of the Powerhouse Preglanum product.
[02:58:07.848 --> 02:58:15.531]  It features the same great formula that supports your heart, brain, healthy aging process with an all new natural caffeine boost included.
[02:58:15.991 --> 02:58:22.435]  A powerful preglanone base, the Real Red Pill, has quickly become one of our fellow InfoWarriors' favorite products.
[02:58:22.435 --> 02:58:32.921]  Now, with an extra proprietary energy blend inside, including green tea extract, yerba mate, leaf extract, and more, you can get that extra pick-me-up while supporting your mind and body in a healthy way.
[02:58:32.921 --> 02:58:37.524]  It's got all the great stuff that Real Red Pill has, but it's also got the boost in it.
[02:58:37.524 --> 02:58:41.366]  Get the Real Red Pill Plus at InfoWarStore.com.
[02:58:46.511 --> 02:58:51.355]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[02:58:51.355 --> 02:59:00.282]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals needed daily.
[02:59:00.282 --> 02:59:05.606]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.
[02:59:05.606 --> 02:59:13.893]  The new platinum standard of advanced multivitamin formulation, Vitamin Mineral Fusion uses a unique delivery system to maximize the effects
[02:59:13.993 --> 02:59:14.313]  I think so.
[02:59:48.782 --> 02:59:51.406]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:02.705 --> 03:00:05.709]  Well, here we are, July 5th, 2018.
[03:00:05.709 --> 03:00:13.638]  Another epic July 4th has come and gone, and never has it been more clear where the stakes are for humanity.
[03:00:13.638 --> 03:00:14.919]  But I want to make a point.
[03:00:14.919 --> 03:00:17.983]  There's a Churchill quote, I'm paraphrasing it, that
[03:00:19.289 --> 03:00:21.331]  Many people get hit by history.
[03:00:21.331 --> 03:00:29.997]  They get run over in the street by huge, big, epic developments and they kind of dust themselves off and ignore the point in history that they're in.
[03:00:29.997 --> 03:00:38.064]  But there are other people that get hit by destiny and hit by history and they get up and it changes the course of their lives and countless other people's lives.
[03:00:39.505 --> 03:00:54.564]  And so I want people to remember that the hundreds of millions that died under communism and the tens of millions that died under fascism and other cults and permutations of governmental control and societal mental illness manifest by government debt
[03:00:55.848 --> 03:00:59.850]  We are on the precipice of a new global revolution, a new renaissance.
[03:00:59.850 --> 03:01:06.635]  And we're actually, because of other people's work before us, sitting on a great brain trust of human liberty.
[03:01:06.635 --> 03:01:14.019]  And that we've got a chance to fight for freedom when the odds are actually on our side if we realize it.
[03:01:14.019 --> 03:01:16.701]  We've got to look back on those that didn't have a chance to win.
[03:01:17.728 --> 03:01:27.396]  But took action and did what was right because it was about their soul and about the spiritual, cultural, human decision they were making.
[03:01:27.396 --> 03:01:29.677]  And that's why they were fulfilled.
[03:01:29.677 --> 03:01:32.700]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you all for your support.
[03:01:32.700 --> 03:01:34.161]  I want to thank you all for your prayers.
[03:01:34.161 --> 03:01:39.005]  I want to thank you all for what you've done against the bullies and the peer pressure over the years.
[03:01:39.005 --> 03:01:45.670]  Because if it wasn't for you, and if it wasn't for everything you've done, we wouldn't be here.
[03:01:47.219 --> 03:01:51.568]  Many of those people aren't here today that stood up for what was right.
[03:01:53.561 --> 03:01:59.863]  But in their gut, they believed in you, and they believed in me, and they believed that we could build a better future.
[03:01:59.863 --> 03:02:01.603]  They had goodwill towards people.
[03:02:01.603 --> 03:02:06.825]  They didn't want to use the fact that they had more knowledge than the average person to control that person.
[03:02:06.825 --> 03:02:13.087]  They didn't want to use the fact that they understood how the game was played to then set up a little secret cabal and feed on people.
[03:02:13.087 --> 03:02:21.870]  They had the true vision of human empowerment and the true mastery to empower others and bring them to the next level.
[03:02:21.870 --> 03:02:22.690]  They were Christ-like.
[03:02:23.638 --> 03:02:27.841]  In their duty, in their focus, in their sacrifice, in their commitment.
[03:02:27.841 --> 03:02:40.589]  And so that's why it's obnoxious, it's flagrant, it's arrogant, it's narcissistic, it's satanic to make the victories we're having about Trump or about Infowars or about anybody else, it's about you.
[03:02:41.770 --> 03:02:44.251]  And your awakening and the decisions you've made.
[03:02:44.251 --> 03:03:04.118]  So, I just want to tell you, as we've passed through this July 4th, 2018, as the globalists launch their riots and their attacks and their lies and their moralizing, that have good cheer, my friends, because we're living in a time and age when the devil knows the time is short, so he sends the beast with wrath.
[03:03:04.118 --> 03:03:06.779]  And there are whole world government systems here, the mark of the beast.
[03:03:06.779 --> 03:03:09.100]  It's going to be a lot of trials, a lot of tribulations, but
[03:03:10.230 --> 03:03:14.533]  We know the truth and we know who wins and we know where this all goes.
[03:03:14.533 --> 03:03:22.698]  And so that's a very positive fact to understand.
[03:03:22.698 --> 03:03:26.041]  All that matters is what you stand for.
[03:03:26.041 --> 03:03:30.964]  All that matters is not being a coward and not feeding on people that aren't as smart as you.
[03:03:30.964 --> 03:03:32.445]  And the minute you realize that,
[03:03:33.524 --> 03:03:48.773]  You're in God's arms forever, and these Satanists, and these Crowleyites, and these Democrats, and these Chi-Coms, and all these control freaks who want to control reality, who want to try to become a God, because they merge with AI technology, they don't understand they already had a connection to God.
[03:03:48.773 --> 03:03:54.797]  They were already an expression of God's consciousness in the universe, and there was no need to ever even do that.
[03:03:54.797 --> 03:03:56.558]  But that's why we have free will.
[03:03:56.558 --> 03:04:00.160]  Some people will fall to the lower dimension.
[03:04:00.160 --> 03:04:02.682]  Some people will rise and ascend towards
[03:04:03.949 --> 03:04:07.050]  A communion and a reunification with Christ.
[03:04:07.050 --> 03:04:08.891]  And that's the big choice.
[03:04:08.891 --> 03:04:11.311]  And that's why I know you've made the right choice.
[03:04:11.311 --> 03:04:13.432]  You're not going to find Christ in these whorehouse churches.
[03:04:13.432 --> 03:04:19.514]  That's where the literal globalists run the operation via the World Council of Churches.
[03:04:19.514 --> 03:04:25.116]  But you're going to find the real Christ in your heart, seeking after God and saying, I want to be a good person.
[03:04:25.116 --> 03:04:26.276]  I want to be just.
[03:04:26.276 --> 03:04:27.116]  I want to be honorable.
[03:04:27.116 --> 03:04:28.437]  I'm going to tell the truth.
[03:04:28.437 --> 03:04:32.298]  So again, are those of us here when we're seeing this great awakening of heroes?
[03:04:33.123 --> 03:04:45.268]  No, the heroes are those in communist China and North Korea and old Soviet Russia and countless other places like Cuba that were tortured and murdered and killed and watched their children go to prison because they didn't deny God and the truth.
[03:04:45.268 --> 03:04:50.571]  And to them on this July 4th, I want to thank you all and thank you for 1776 Worldwide.
[03:04:50.571 --> 03:04:51.191]  God bless you all.

[03:05:59.483 --> 03:06:04.306]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:29.671 --> 03:06:31.692]  Alright, Paul Watson's about to get on.
[03:06:31.692 --> 03:06:34.132]  We only got two Skype lines, so we're going to get one of these great guys off.
[03:06:34.132 --> 03:06:36.133]  We'll get Paul dialed in about to take over.
[03:06:36.133 --> 03:06:38.453]  Finishing up, statements on just the epic moment in time.
[03:06:38.453 --> 03:06:42.754]  We're at Will Johnson of YonAmericaFirst.com.
[03:06:42.754 --> 03:06:44.835]  Yes, thank you for having me once again.
[03:06:44.835 --> 03:06:46.475]  I've really enjoyed it.
[03:06:46.475 --> 03:06:47.675]  It's been a real honor.
[03:06:47.675 --> 03:06:53.457]  I would like to extend an invitation to you, Alex Jones, to come on my broadcast with me if that's possible.
[03:06:53.457 --> 03:06:56.217]  You are either Owen or most definitely even Rob.
[03:06:56.217 --> 03:06:58.318]  I want to come on your show anytime.
[03:06:59.657 --> 03:07:03.259]  That would be absolutely phenomenal if you would join me.
[03:07:03.259 --> 03:07:04.440]  I just want to say, you know what?
[03:07:04.440 --> 03:07:06.821]  M4 Wars is the tip of the spear.
[03:07:06.821 --> 03:07:09.763]  I think what you're doing is so heroic.
[03:07:09.763 --> 03:07:16.366]  It's just something that we all can look up to and admire and that we have to get in this fight together.
[03:07:16.366 --> 03:07:18.568]  Sitting down is no longer an option.
[03:07:18.568 --> 03:07:20.068]  So I want to thank you for having me on.
[03:07:21.269 --> 03:07:22.589]  I want to thank you.
[03:07:22.589 --> 03:07:23.109]  God bless you.
[03:07:23.109 --> 03:07:25.610]  Let me just say something about Bill Johnson.
[03:07:25.610 --> 03:07:27.090]  See how humble he is?
[03:07:27.090 --> 03:07:29.891]  He's just as well-spoken, has just as much courage as I do.
[03:07:29.891 --> 03:07:31.051]  He heard what we were doing.
[03:07:31.051 --> 03:07:31.732]  He was already awake.
[03:07:31.732 --> 03:07:32.832]  He went out and took action.
[03:07:32.832 --> 03:07:34.172]  He's just here thanking us.
[03:07:34.172 --> 03:07:34.772]  Take the left.
[03:07:34.772 --> 03:07:38.933]  It's all about them, about their Satanism, about their personal power, about where they're going.
[03:07:38.933 --> 03:07:40.054]  They think they're ascending.
[03:07:40.054 --> 03:07:41.274]  They're sinking into hell.
[03:07:41.894 --> 03:07:45.475]  Christ is the way to get out of this and we know that and that's why they hate us.
[03:07:45.475 --> 03:07:47.035]  That's why they're coming after us.
[03:07:47.035 --> 03:07:48.736]  That was Will Johnson leaving us.
[03:07:48.736 --> 03:07:52.357]  Joey Gibson with your prayer vigils that get attacked by Antifa.
[03:07:52.357 --> 03:07:54.878]  Again, tell us about that next event you've got coming up.
[03:07:54.878 --> 03:07:56.118]  Did you say August 5th?
[03:07:56.118 --> 03:07:56.418]  August 4th.
[03:08:01.055 --> 03:08:06.678]  Basically, the goal is this, is we respond by their violence with getting more people to show up.
[03:08:06.678 --> 03:08:11.080]  If we can flood the streets with thousands of people, you know, we know the support is out there.
[03:08:11.080 --> 03:08:15.823]  It's about inspiring them to actually go out there and stand up for what they believe in.
[03:08:15.823 --> 03:08:21.065]  Because the enemy, the elites, all these people at the top, they don't want us to stand up for what we believe in.
[03:08:21.065 --> 03:08:22.686]  They want us to remain silent.
[03:08:22.686 --> 03:08:26.948]  And Alex, if you can be there, you're the one guy that can, you know, bring thousands of people with you.
[03:08:26.948 --> 03:08:28.149]  And we'd love to have you.
[03:08:28.149 --> 03:08:28.589]  And I think
[03:08:28.609 --> 03:08:34.835]  I think it would make the event a lot more safe because we can't trust the police if we just flooded the streets.
[03:08:34.835 --> 03:08:36.637]  I want to go to all these events.
[03:08:36.637 --> 03:08:38.418]  Here's the thing.
[03:08:38.418 --> 03:08:45.085]  I'm here running these operations and I'm every day getting important communique as to what we need to do and I want to do it.
[03:08:45.085 --> 03:08:48.168]  And then they've got me pinned down because when I leave they've gone for my family.
[03:08:48.168 --> 03:08:50.150]  I've got to take my family with me now everywhere.
[03:08:50.150 --> 03:08:51.071]  It's gotten really bad.
[03:08:51.631 --> 03:08:52.552]  I can't get into all that.
[03:08:52.552 --> 03:08:54.793]  I had to go off air yesterday because of it.
[03:08:54.793 --> 03:08:56.074]  We need everybody's prayers here.
[03:08:56.074 --> 03:08:56.894]  I'm not complaining about it.
[03:08:56.894 --> 03:08:59.336]  I asked for all this, but I do need the prayers.
[03:08:59.336 --> 03:09:01.177]  So absolutely.
[03:09:01.177 --> 03:09:02.018]  Joey, thank you so much.
[03:09:02.018 --> 03:09:02.818]  We'll talk to you soon.
[03:09:02.818 --> 03:09:04.379]  Great job.
[03:09:04.379 --> 03:09:11.443]  Well, and thanks to the support we get from our audience, you know, we have so many reporters now that we can actually send crews out to these events, get the footage.
[03:09:11.443 --> 03:09:17.227]  And that's the key, is to get the footage and just put a camera up to these people and just say, hey, what are you doing out here?
[03:09:17.227 --> 03:09:20.349]  Oh, you know, I'm protesting that children being separated from children.
[03:09:20.729 --> 03:09:21.129]  Oh, really?
[03:09:21.129 --> 03:09:23.572]  I guess you didn't care about it eight years ago, then.
[03:09:23.572 --> 03:09:28.136]  Or whistleblowers have come out that Obama would put them with child traffickers and have them unvetted.
[03:09:28.136 --> 03:09:30.898]  Here, just let kids cross the border and get in vans randomly.
[03:09:30.898 --> 03:09:31.839]  That's a great idea.
[03:09:31.839 --> 03:09:34.341]  Coyotes can just pick them right up on the Texas side.
[03:09:34.341 --> 03:09:35.342]  Oh, what a wonderful idea.
[03:09:35.342 --> 03:09:37.444]  Violate federal law, you know?
[03:09:37.444 --> 03:09:43.189]  They're playing Darker Than Night in the desert with rattlesnakes, little kids come across with people who don't even know who the hell they are.
[03:09:43.189 --> 03:09:44.850]  Don't check anybody, just here, come on in!
[03:09:46.171 --> 03:09:46.712]  Sounds great.
[03:09:46.712 --> 03:09:47.252]  Open borders.
[03:09:47.252 --> 03:09:48.853]  Oh, but we don't want open borders.
[03:09:48.853 --> 03:09:50.014]  That's not what we want.
[03:09:50.014 --> 03:09:54.017]  But everyone has a right to just come on in, according... But that's why you expose them.
[03:09:54.017 --> 03:09:58.000]  That's why you put them on camera, you show who they are, and then you have hashtag walkaway trend on there.
[03:09:58.000 --> 03:09:59.341]  Hey, look who that is right there.
[03:09:59.341 --> 03:10:03.664]  That's Paul Joseph Watson, the great, over there in the UK.
[03:10:03.664 --> 03:10:06.546]  Big article about Trump getting ready to come out about 9-11.
[03:10:06.546 --> 03:10:07.267]  That's all coming up.
[03:10:07.267 --> 03:10:08.488]  He's taking over in T-minus two minutes.
[03:10:08.488 --> 03:10:11.350]  But first, your announcement to the president that we've got here.
[03:10:11.590 --> 03:10:19.679]  Well, you know, I wanted to do something special for President Trump for the 4th of July, and I noticed that he got snubbed by the Philadelphia Eagles.
[03:10:19.679 --> 03:10:20.419]  I couldn't believe it.
[03:10:20.419 --> 03:10:25.505]  He got snubbed by the Super Bowl Champion Eagles, and he did not get his championship jersey.
[03:10:25.505 --> 03:10:28.928]  So I went ahead and I ordered one for you, President Trump.
[03:10:28.928 --> 03:10:31.651]  This is your 4th of July present right here.
[03:10:33.713 --> 03:10:35.334]  It's the Eagles-Trump jersey.
[03:10:35.334 --> 03:10:38.155]  I don't know why they didn't want to give it to you, but I had it made, President Trump.
[03:10:38.155 --> 03:10:40.536]  We've got it for you right here in the InfoWars studio.
[03:10:40.536 --> 03:10:41.196]  This is for you.
[03:10:41.196 --> 03:10:42.537]  By the way, I've got a special address.
[03:10:42.537 --> 03:10:43.738]  I could mail him anything.
[03:10:43.738 --> 03:10:44.998]  Little secret out.
[03:10:44.998 --> 03:10:50.080]  We'll mail that sucker right to, right to him today.
[03:10:50.080 --> 03:10:51.761]  This is for President Trump.
[03:10:51.761 --> 03:10:52.741]  Go America!
[03:10:52.741 --> 03:10:53.442]  Go Trump!
[03:10:53.442 --> 03:10:54.382]  Fly, Eagles, fly!
[03:10:54.382 --> 03:10:58.164]  We came into the segment, it wasn't even supposed to be that way with Fly Like an Eagle, so here we are.
[03:10:58.664 --> 03:11:00.365]  By the way, that wasn't even a setup.
[03:11:00.365 --> 03:11:01.185]  That just happened.
[03:11:01.185 --> 03:11:03.586]  President Trump is flying like an eagle.
[03:11:03.586 --> 03:11:05.807]  He got snubbed by the Super Bowl champions.
[03:11:05.807 --> 03:11:06.527]  I'm not buying it.
[03:11:06.527 --> 03:11:14.111]  So I wanted President Trump to have his jersey here, recognized as President 45, the greatest president in modern history.
[03:11:14.111 --> 03:11:17.592]  And here is your Super Bowl champion eagle's jersey, President Trump.
[03:11:17.592 --> 03:11:19.313]  I hope this receives you well.
[03:11:19.313 --> 03:11:21.174]  And you deserve it.
[03:11:21.174 --> 03:11:26.716]  Notice that Lynch and all these top real liberals are saying Trump may be the greatest president ever.
[03:11:27.403 --> 03:11:28.604]  I mean, let me tell you.
[03:11:28.604 --> 03:11:31.146]  Well, when history pans out, we can talk about that.
[03:11:31.146 --> 03:11:33.507]  But modern history, my life, not even close.
[03:11:33.507 --> 03:11:34.228]  There's no debate.
[03:11:34.228 --> 03:11:35.389]  Yeah, he's already eclipsed Reagan.
[03:11:37.022 --> 03:11:39.323]  Because Reagan got shot in the first year to get him.
[03:11:39.323 --> 03:11:41.365]  All right, Paul Watson, you're taking over, my friend.
[03:11:41.365 --> 03:11:42.325]  Great job.
[03:11:42.325 --> 03:11:42.746]  We love you.
[03:11:42.746 --> 03:11:43.266]  We appreciate you.
[03:11:43.266 --> 03:11:47.889]  By the way, we have the new T-shirt we're selling, because they have Impeach Trump 45 at Walmart.
[03:11:47.889 --> 03:11:50.951]  We have Reelect Trump at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:11:50.951 --> 03:11:52.832]  Reelect 45.
[03:11:52.832 --> 03:11:55.654]  So it's Reelect, not the other one.
[03:11:55.654 --> 03:11:56.975]  That's now exclusively available.
[03:11:56.975 --> 03:11:58.816]  They're getting printed right here, right here in Texas.
[03:11:58.816 --> 03:11:59.677]  Shipped out next week.
[03:11:59.677 --> 03:12:00.777]  Get your order in now.
[03:12:00.777 --> 03:12:01.958]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:12:01.958 --> 03:12:02.578]  No reviews yet.
[03:12:02.578 --> 03:12:03.359]  We just launched today.
[03:12:03.359 --> 03:12:05.941]  And then we have Meme Like a Wolverine.
[03:12:06.941 --> 03:12:09.965]  It's not the Marvel comic Wimpy Wolverine, it's the Trump Wolverine.
[03:12:09.965 --> 03:12:10.967]  Can we pull that up?
[03:12:10.967 --> 03:12:13.650]  That's available at Infowarstore.com.
[03:12:13.650 --> 03:12:16.253]  So be sure and get those and fund the operation.
[03:12:16.253 --> 03:12:18.196]  Everybody have a great July 4th.
[03:12:18.196 --> 03:12:24.144]  And now the Master of Ceremonies for the 2018 July 4th is the Red Coat Supreme Leader, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:12:24.144 --> 03:12:25.005]  My friend, please take over.
[03:12:26.092 --> 03:12:27.593]  Thanks Alex, happy 4th of July.
[03:12:27.593 --> 03:12:37.037]  Yeah, I'm looking at these polls which have come out since the whole scandal over the border issue, which of course was the latest scandal that was supposed to sink President Trump for good.
[03:12:37.037 --> 03:12:39.839]  We have one every week from the mainstream media.
[03:12:39.839 --> 03:12:44.421]  But what's happened, this is really interesting, over the course of the past two weeks, just under
[03:12:45.041 --> 03:12:56.709]  Is that President Trump's approval rating, despite being relentlessly pounded by the mainstream media over this border enforcement issue, is approval rating, and this is real clear politics, headline.
[03:12:57.569 --> 03:12:58.310]  Media fail.
[03:12:58.310 --> 03:13:02.553]  Trump's approval rating improved during manufactured border outrage.
[03:13:02.553 --> 03:13:04.614]  This is real clear politics.
[03:13:04.614 --> 03:13:09.478]  Average of polls, poll of polls, has gone up by five points.
[03:13:09.478 --> 03:13:10.699]  That's not even Rasmussen.
[03:13:10.699 --> 03:13:12.400]  You can't claim it's got Republican bias.
[03:13:12.400 --> 03:13:14.882]  This is the average of all the polls.
[03:13:14.882 --> 03:13:24.510]  His approval rating has gone up five points since this whole separating children from their parents scandal that was supposed to sink him.
[03:13:24.510 --> 03:13:25.911]  Five point improvement.
[03:13:25.911 --> 03:13:27.212]  You drill down into this poll.
[03:13:28.172 --> 03:13:34.679]  A ten point surge in support from, wait for it, Hispanic Americans!
[03:13:34.679 --> 03:13:39.944]  Ten point surge since Trump was supposedly finished with this big border scandal.
[03:13:39.944 --> 03:13:45.270]  His average has gone up five points during the establishment media's manufactured outrage.
[03:13:45.270 --> 03:13:50.195]  So the manufactured media's propaganda is boomeranging, it's backfiring is what you're saying, Paul?
[03:13:51.448 --> 03:13:53.490]  Yes, they've got no platform, Alex.
[03:13:53.490 --> 03:13:55.092]  It's just constant hysteria.
[03:13:55.092 --> 03:14:06.665]  Remember that scream helplessly at the sky thing from last year?
[03:14:06.665 --> 03:14:11.490]  They're still on that, but then they're adding, oh by the way, start attacking Trump supporters, start attacking Trump.
[03:14:11.490 --> 03:14:12.652]  And then you look at another poll.
[03:14:13.357 --> 03:14:19.804]  Survey finds among white millennial men, 23% move from Democrats to GOP in the last two years.
[03:14:19.804 --> 03:14:25.030]  So they already lost 9% in millennial votes since 2016, which we covered before.
[03:14:25.658 --> 03:14:37.922]  Now another new poll has found that white millennial men, gee I wonder why white millennial men are shifting over to the GOP when every single day the narrative is relentlessly white men are to blame for everything.
[03:14:37.922 --> 03:14:42.824]  You know, toxic masculinity, kill all white men trending on Twitter.
[03:14:42.824 --> 03:14:46.805]  So a 23% shift from Dems to GOP in the last two years.
[03:14:47.970 --> 03:14:53.814]  Article reads, the Democrats have been relishing their popularity with Millennials for a variety of reasons.
[03:14:53.814 --> 03:14:55.495]  55% of Millennials voted for Hillary Clinton.
[03:14:55.495 --> 03:14:56.216]  33% voted for Trump.
[03:14:59.682 --> 03:15:09.044]  The new polls found that 23% have shifted, even though you've obviously still got overwhelming support for the Democrats, among white millennial men.
[03:15:09.044 --> 03:15:11.125]  It's shifted big time.
[03:15:11.125 --> 03:15:19.347]  A Pew Research study also found that millennials gave a 64% job approval rating to President Obama, but only 27% approval for Trump in 2018.
[03:15:20.777 --> 03:15:23.998]  But this goes alongside the ICE poll, obviously.
[03:15:23.998 --> 03:15:35.622]  Part of the freak-out, part of the screaming helplessly at the sky is this call to abolish ICE, which is also completely unpopular with the American people.
[03:15:35.622 --> 03:15:39.063]  73% of swing voters oppose the abolition of ICE.
[03:15:39.063 --> 03:15:40.843]  This is a losing platform.
[03:15:40.843 --> 03:15:43.144]  It's just hysteria on steroids at this point.
[03:15:43.564 --> 03:15:44.765]  And it's gonna backfire.
[03:15:44.765 --> 03:15:45.446]  It's gonna fail.
[03:15:45.446 --> 03:15:46.907]  So we should be applauding them.
[03:15:46.907 --> 03:15:50.189]  We should be saying they should carry on with this hysterical rhetoric.
[03:15:50.189 --> 03:15:51.790]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live.
[03:15:51.790 --> 03:15:53.252]  We'll be back in four hours.

[03:15:59.917 --> 03:16:05.241]  Finally someone has come out and written what I think is the best ex-mose on the shadow government ever.
[03:16:05.241 --> 03:16:10.725]  We're in a constitutional crisis and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government.
[03:16:10.905 --> 03:16:14.346]  We gotta get this out, because just because you're awake, folks, doesn't mean other people are.

[03:17:22.560 --> 03:17:24.522]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[03:17:24.522 --> 03:17:29.847]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[03:17:29.847 --> 03:17:31.429]  But the symptoms are there.
[03:17:31.429 --> 03:17:39.777]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[03:17:39.777 --> 03:17:45.483]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[03:17:45.883 --> 03:17:47.464]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[03:17:47.464 --> 03:17:49.745]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[03:17:49.745 --> 03:17:54.367]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[03:17:54.367 --> 03:17:58.308]  Living in a volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:17:58.308 --> 03:18:01.590]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[03:18:01.590 --> 03:18:07.853]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater, and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:18:07.853 --> 03:18:10.634]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[03:18:11.374 --> 03:18:15.196]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[03:18:15.196 --> 03:18:21.659]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:18:21.659 --> 03:18:26.622]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:18:27.372 --> 03:18:31.295]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[03:18:31.295 --> 03:18:38.500]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:18:38.500 --> 03:18:43.724]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[03:18:43.724 --> 03:18:49.409]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:18:49.409 --> 03:18:53.392]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:18:54.440 --> 03:18:56.800]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.
[03:18:56.800 --> 03:18:58.941]  We're really, really proud of it.

[03:19:57.752 --> 03:20:00.414]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:06.809 --> 03:20:14.320]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:14.320 --> 03:20:18.307]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:20:21.184 --> 03:20:23.365]  We're live and it's Paul Tower of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:23.365 --> 03:20:27.167]  We're talking about the reaction, the fallout, to this scandal.
[03:20:27.167 --> 03:20:36.693]  This latest scandal, there's a new one every week, that was supposed to sink the Trump administration, the border patrol policy, the separation of children from their parents.
[03:20:36.693 --> 03:20:46.078]  We have a new poll out, which is a poll of polls, an average poll, headline, media fail, Trump's approval rating improved during manufactured border outrage.
[03:20:46.078 --> 03:20:48.179]  This is by John Nolte over at Breitbart.
[03:20:48.894 --> 03:21:02.681]  President Trump's job approval rating improved by five points during the establishment media's manufactured outrage over Trump continuing the Obama administration's policy of separating illegal alien adults from children at the border.
[03:21:02.681 --> 03:21:04.182]  Now this is real clear politics.
[03:21:04.182 --> 03:21:11.626]  This is not Rasmussen, which they say, oh that's Republican bias, even though literally almost every other poll oversamples Democrats.
[03:21:11.626 --> 03:21:14.427]  But this is real clear politics, poll of polls.
[03:21:14.427 --> 03:21:16.108]  Trump's approval rating rounded out
[03:21:17.012 --> 03:21:24.315]  On June 8th, Trump's approval rating rounded out to an average of 42%, while his disapproval rating averaged 54%.
[03:21:24.315 --> 03:21:29.116]  So back on June 8th, it was a 12-point gap.
[03:21:29.116 --> 03:21:41.461]  As of Monday, July 2nd, yesterday, after two weeks of being pounded by the entire media over border enforcement, Trump's approval rating has climbed to 44% and his disapproval rating has dropped.
[03:21:43.542 --> 03:21:51.426]  So the margin between the two has improved by five points since this scandal.
[03:21:51.426 --> 03:21:59.589]  Since the scandal they called Trump's Katrina that would sink his presidency again for the 250th time over the past 18 months.
[03:21:59.589 --> 03:22:09.274]  And it goes on to point out that when you drill down into this poll, part of that improvement is due to a 10 point surge in support from Hispanic Americans.
[03:22:10.223 --> 03:22:23.417]  John Nolte goes on to comment, imagine being the establishment media today, imagine knowing you threw everything you had at the president that you coordinated a perfect narrative storm using recordings of crying children and hoax photographs.
[03:22:23.417 --> 03:22:30.044]  Because obviously if there's an audio tape of a child crying that must mean we need to erase the border right and get rid of all laws.
[03:22:30.704 --> 03:22:39.110]  Imagine that you poured all your hopes, your dreams and resources into manufacturing that one bulletproof story that would finally bring this guy down.
[03:22:39.110 --> 03:22:40.611]  And what happened in the end?
[03:22:40.611 --> 03:22:48.756]  Not only is Trump in better shape now than before this fake news jihad, the public is increasingly siding with him on border and immigration issues.
[03:22:48.756 --> 03:22:52.779]  So yeah, they thought that this would be the one issue to sink Trump.
[03:22:52.779 --> 03:22:55.761]  It was a battle of the bulge, all-out assault by the media.
[03:22:56.919 --> 03:22:58.080]  What happened?
[03:22:58.080 --> 03:23:00.422]  Trump came out on top once again.
[03:23:00.422 --> 03:23:04.966]  This is why they seem to be just getting more hysterical, more out of control.
[03:23:04.966 --> 03:23:11.811]  And even though it doesn't work, and anyone from an objective, neutral, a zoomed out perspective can see it's not working.
[03:23:11.811 --> 03:23:15.915]  It's only making swing voters more nervous about voting against Trump.
[03:23:16.315 --> 03:23:18.776]  Because they say, oh my god, this is the other option.
[03:23:18.776 --> 03:23:20.536]  Complete hysteria.
[03:23:20.536 --> 03:23:23.457]  Complete mad cat behaviour every single day.
[03:23:23.457 --> 03:23:25.017]  It's actually helping him.
[03:23:25.017 --> 03:23:29.119]  And it's helping him in terms of white millennial men as well.
[03:23:29.119 --> 03:23:37.581]  As this headline out of Daily Wire discusses, survey finds among white millennial men 23% move from Dems to GOP in last two years.
[03:23:38.664 --> 03:23:51.308]  So we had the Millennials percentage shift which we talked about a couple of months ago which was 9% Democrats have lost 9% Millennial support since the 2016 election.
[03:23:51.308 --> 03:24:05.131]  Now the Guardian reports that a Reuters, Ipsos, Megapoll of 16,000 respondents found that in the last two years support for Democrats among Millennials plunged from 55% to 46% while support for Republicans has only dropped from 28% to 27%.
[03:24:07.802 --> 03:24:23.029]  So in the last two years on top of that, support from white millennial men, which of course Democrats have completely abandoned and basically blamed them for every mass shooting that's happened over the past year, has gone from the Democrats leading Republicans by 12%
[03:24:26.544 --> 03:24:27.265]  We're good to go.
[03:24:43.419 --> 03:24:51.065]  Are they not reading about the fact that, one, they had a 13, 14 point lead in the race for the House back in December?
[03:24:51.065 --> 03:24:59.993]  That's completely evaporated, so either within the margin of error, or some polls show that Republicans are now ahead in the race for Congress in the midterms.
[03:25:00.653 --> 03:25:02.475]  I mean, are they not reading these polls?
[03:25:02.475 --> 03:25:14.365]  Do they just think that this endless wall of hysteria, this talk of civil war, this talk of confronting, getting in the face of Trump supporters and Trump administration officials, do they think that's actually working?
[03:25:14.365 --> 03:25:15.486]  Because it isn't!
[03:25:15.486 --> 03:25:17.487]  I'm telling you right now, it isn't working.
[03:25:17.487 --> 03:25:19.449]  None of the polls show it's working.
[03:25:19.449 --> 03:25:24.533]  So again, I've talked about this before, like with the David Hogg issue, for example.
[03:25:24.533 --> 03:25:27.536]  People were freaking out back a couple of months ago, three months ago,
[03:25:28.183 --> 03:25:30.746]  About trying to counter David Hogg's narrative.
[03:25:30.746 --> 03:25:32.428]  You don't need to counter his narrative.
[03:25:32.428 --> 03:25:36.712]  He's the biggest gun salesman of the year, bar none.
[03:25:36.712 --> 03:25:37.373]  Okay?
[03:25:37.373 --> 03:25:40.677]  They're shooting themselves in the foot at every available opportunity.
[03:25:40.677 --> 03:25:41.898]  They're scoring on goals.
[03:25:41.898 --> 03:25:44.641]  Don't interrupt the enemy when they're making a mistake.
[03:25:45.180 --> 03:25:47.881]  And it goes straight to the ice issue as well.
[03:25:47.881 --> 03:25:50.422]  We've had, you know, Bernie Sanders.
[03:25:50.422 --> 03:25:52.582]  Bernie Sanders is now on the rack.
[03:25:52.582 --> 03:25:59.685]  Bernie Sanders is too right-wing because he refuses to say that he wants to outright abolish ice.
[03:25:59.685 --> 03:26:08.007]  Even as you have these hard-left protesters occupying ice offices, in some cases throwing bricks, throwing stones at them.
[03:26:08.007 --> 03:26:10.628]  This is a headline out of Daily Caller.
[03:26:11.565 --> 03:26:12.465]  Abolish ICE.
[03:26:12.465 --> 03:26:15.406]  Vandals throw brick through window of GOP office.
[03:26:15.406 --> 03:26:17.307]  Leave graffiti message.
[03:26:17.307 --> 03:26:18.327]  This happened yesterday.
[03:26:18.327 --> 03:26:24.188]  Vandals threw a brick through the window of the Nebraska Republican Party's headquarters in Lincoln, Nebraska on Monday night.
[03:26:24.188 --> 03:26:27.209]  Again, this was abolish ICE protesters.
[03:26:27.209 --> 03:26:31.970]  We've had other events, including one in Philadelphia, which is ongoing right now.
[03:26:31.970 --> 03:26:33.611]  Last time I checked, at least.
[03:26:33.611 --> 03:26:38.232]  Protests turned violent as demonstrators arrested in front of Philadelphia ICE building.
[03:26:38.852 --> 03:26:47.674]  Protests turned violent as activists were taken into custody on the streets of Philadelphia today as they were calling for the abolishment of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
[03:26:47.674 --> 03:26:52.295]  The protests are taking place in front of the ICE office in Centre City.
[03:26:52.295 --> 03:26:53.515]  So they're out.
[03:26:53.515 --> 03:26:54.735]  They're getting rowdy.
[03:26:54.735 --> 03:26:58.676]  But again, you go back to the polls, which none of them seem to be looking at.
[03:26:58.676 --> 03:27:01.237]  This is a Harvest Harris poll.
[03:27:01.237 --> 03:27:07.138]  Swing voters are overwhelmingly opposed to the Democrats' plan to end all immigration enforcement across the US.
[03:27:08.402 --> 03:27:15.405]  Nearly 3 in 4 swing voters, which is 73%, said they do not want ICE to be disbanded.
[03:27:15.405 --> 03:27:19.967]  Less than 30% of swing voters said they support the abolishment of ICE.
[03:27:19.967 --> 03:27:25.949]  It goes on to say, even Democrat voters are opposed to the abolition of ICE.
[03:27:25.949 --> 03:27:31.692]  Nearly 60% of Democrats said they do not want ICE to be disbanded.
[03:27:31.692 --> 03:27:32.072]  So again,
[03:27:33.110 --> 03:27:44.137]  Every single poll you look at, these policies, this hysteria, is not supported by the majority of the American people or by even really a minority of swing voters.
[03:27:44.137 --> 03:27:47.199]  This is going to backfire on them horribly.
[03:27:47.199 --> 03:27:55.484]  They've lost the gap in terms of the massive lead they had for the House, for the Congress race, and they've lost it in terms of white millennial men.
[03:27:55.484 --> 03:27:56.345]  And why do you think?
[03:27:56.345 --> 03:27:58.686]  It's because every single day the narrative is to
[03:27:58.746 --> 03:27:59.927]  We're good to go.
[03:28:18.101 --> 03:28:19.322]  Right next to it.
[03:28:19.322 --> 03:28:39.095]  The screenshot was literally like five images of condensed text that you would have to blow up to a full screen just to see every single instance of where the mainstream media, of where the hard left, had blamed white men for literally every evil or every imagined evil in their hysterical worldview on the planet.
[03:28:39.455 --> 03:28:41.477]  So that's why they've lost that support.
[03:28:41.477 --> 03:28:49.466]  That's why they continue to lose support amongst everyone, even Hispanics, to the tune of 10% in terms of Trump over the past couple of weeks.
[03:28:49.466 --> 03:28:49.926]  We'll be back.
[03:28:49.926 --> 03:28:52.209]  This is the Alex Jones Show live from 4Wars.com.
[03:28:53.496 --> 03:28:55.357]  Healthcare reform is confusing.

[03:33:06.092 --> 03:33:08.373]  News, analysis, reports.
[03:33:08.373 --> 03:33:10.694]  It's The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:10.694 --> 03:33:13.535]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:33:22.768 --> 03:33:23.248]  We're back.
[03:33:23.248 --> 03:33:26.090]  It is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:26.090 --> 03:33:31.033]  Now there's a very interesting article which came out yesterday and it's up on Infowars.com.
[03:33:31.033 --> 03:33:34.376]  South Koreans revolt against arrival of Muslim refugees.
[03:33:34.376 --> 03:33:42.881]  Now this is not really an issue that you hear a lot of in terms of Asian countries because of course they have very limited, very strict immigration.
[03:33:42.881 --> 03:33:48.705]  But as soon as it came to the fore in terms of 1,000 asylum seekers from Yemen,
[03:33:49.491 --> 03:33:52.173]  Basically turning up on a South Korean resort island.
[03:33:52.173 --> 03:33:55.236]  They absolutely freaked out!
[03:33:55.236 --> 03:33:56.177]  They had 520,000.
[03:33:56.177 --> 03:33:58.339]  In fact, this morning it's probably closer to 600,000.
[03:33:59.944 --> 03:34:01.425]  Sign a petition.
[03:34:01.425 --> 03:34:05.508]  Over half a million signed a petition asserting that Muslim migrants don't integrate.
[03:34:05.508 --> 03:34:06.789]  This is South Korea.
[03:34:06.789 --> 03:34:10.931]  And they don't want their country to end up like the UK or Germany.
[03:34:10.931 --> 03:34:14.854]  They literally had signs out on the street saying, we don't want to be like Europe.
[03:34:14.854 --> 03:34:20.918]  In fact, I'm probably going to make a video about this and I'll show you those signs probably tomorrow.
[03:34:20.918 --> 03:34:25.881]  But again, the controversy began when an influx of nearly 1,000 asylum seekers from Yemen, and to be fair,
[03:34:26.815 --> 03:34:44.635]  Yemen is in a civil war so a lot of these people will genuinely be refugees but some of them won't because of course to afford to get a flight to South Africa from a country like Yemen you have to be part of the middle class really, you have to be of wealth simply to afford those travel costs.
[03:34:44.635 --> 03:34:47.399]  But they arrived on the South Korean resort island of Jeju
[03:34:47.959 --> 03:34:56.128]  Because basically the government there, or the local government, changed the rules to say you didn't need a visa to go there on holiday.
[03:34:56.128 --> 03:35:02.214]  So they turned up as tourists, around 950 of them, the majority from Yemen.
[03:35:02.214 --> 03:35:07.860]  And of course now that this has got press attention, you'll get others turning up as tourists and abusing the rules.
[03:35:08.627 --> 03:35:19.595]  To stay, because they get a one month permit when they arrive as tourists, but then they immediately claim asylum, and of course that process can take years, while they remain in the country.
[03:35:19.595 --> 03:35:28.102]  And as we've seen in numerous other European countries, a sizable portion of these individuals just disappear, and you never hear from them again.
[03:35:28.763 --> 03:35:35.125]  So they interviewed somebody called Hank Kim, who was the owner of the Core Travel Agency on that South Korean resort island.
[03:35:35.125 --> 03:35:37.185]  Basically, it's a holiday island.
[03:35:37.185 --> 03:35:39.246]  He said, the local people here are worried.
[03:35:39.246 --> 03:35:46.628]  We have read all about the problems that immigrants have caused in Europe, in Germany and France in particular, and we do not want that to happen here.
[03:35:46.628 --> 03:35:49.249]  This is one of the locals there.
[03:35:49.249 --> 03:35:57.431]  And he went on to emphasize that the limited amount of Muslim immigration they've had into South Korea, which is very limited compared to other countries in Europe,
[03:35:58.371 --> 03:36:06.976]  He said they all have big families and they bring their own culture instead of trying to adapt to the place where they live, which of course we know is true.
[03:36:06.976 --> 03:36:11.939]  Ghettoization, no-go zones across Europe, it's a common phenomenon, it's no longer denied.
[03:36:11.939 --> 03:36:14.301]  They once tried to claim it was a conspiracy theory.
[03:36:14.301 --> 03:36:20.645]  It got so bad, ambulance crews, firemen were being attacked, police were being attacked, cars were being set on fire.
[03:36:21.391 --> 03:36:26.377]  No, they have to admit it's a reality in Sweden, in Germany, in all these other countries.
[03:36:26.377 --> 03:36:30.281]  So South Korea does not want to be like that.
[03:36:30.281 --> 03:36:38.651]  So over 120,000 people signed a petition, it's probably closer to 600,000 now, opposing the arrival of Muslim refugees.
[03:36:38.651 --> 03:36:41.134]  Then they had a protest in Seoul on Saturday.
[03:36:41.807 --> 03:36:44.828]  And that's from what I was talking about earlier with the signs.
[03:36:44.828 --> 03:36:53.691]  Literally, they were carrying signs that said, we don't want refugees, we don't want to be like Europe, we don't want to be like UK, we don't want to be like Germany.
[03:36:53.691 --> 03:36:57.312]  That's what those signs mean there that you're seeing right now in Korean.
[03:36:57.312 --> 03:37:02.353]  But there are also some in English off a different video, which I'm going to make a video about tomorrow, probably.
[03:37:02.353 --> 03:37:09.115]  So they also interviewed a professor, a Song Jung Chae, at the Center for Global Creation and Collaboration at Seoul's Sangmyung
[03:37:10.776 --> 03:37:11.537]  We're good to go.
[03:37:34.753 --> 03:37:38.834]  He mentioned paedophile grooming gangs, which of course are a huge problem across the UK.
[03:37:38.834 --> 03:37:39.994]  They're not dealt with.
[03:37:39.994 --> 03:37:44.035]  In many cases, they actually arrest the people who blow the whistle on them.
[03:37:44.035 --> 03:37:49.176]  And he mentioned terrorism as well, as two negative side effects that South Korea did not want to import.
[03:37:49.176 --> 03:37:53.697]  Don't see a lot of terrorism, or at least Islamic terrorism, in South Korea, do you?
[03:37:53.697 --> 03:37:56.437]  Don't see a lot of Islamic terrorism in Japan.
[03:37:56.437 --> 03:37:57.497]  Gee, I wonder why.
[03:37:57.497 --> 03:38:00.338]  Again, goes back to the argument of
[03:38:01.408 --> 03:38:03.170]  Well, it's just a minority.
[03:38:03.170 --> 03:38:04.991]  Yeah, it only takes a minority.
[03:38:04.991 --> 03:38:09.275]  You look at every historical example, it only takes a minority for the problems to be huge.
[03:38:09.275 --> 03:38:12.417]  That's not the argument it never has been.
[03:38:12.417 --> 03:38:18.242]  Now, this view that South Koreans share, and they're obviously, you know, racist for doing so, even though they're not white,
[03:38:18.991 --> 03:38:21.913]  ...is also shared by the majority of European citizens.
[03:38:21.913 --> 03:38:31.899]  We've talked about this poll before out of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, which is quite ironic because that's a big globalist group which is probably pushing for mass immigration.
[03:38:33.672 --> 03:38:45.055]  55% of Europeans, if you ask across the country, some countries it's more, some countries it's less, but the average is 55% of European citizens support a total ban on Muslim immigration.
[03:38:45.055 --> 03:38:57.639]  A total ban tomorrow on all Muslim immigration, the very thing that Trump mooted, that he suggested during his campaign run, is supported by the majority of Europeans right now.
[03:38:57.639 --> 03:38:58.639]  Now in South Korea,
[03:38:59.696 --> 03:39:04.978]  They had 9,942 people apply for refugee status last year.
[03:39:04.978 --> 03:39:11.220]  This year that's doubled according to the new statistics because of programs like I mentioned earlier.
[03:39:11.220 --> 03:39:16.722]  But they only allowed 121 people to stay to claim asylum out of that near 10,000.
[03:39:18.354 --> 03:39:28.403]  So unlike European countries who basically accept way too many on quite dubious merits in a lot of cases, South Korea is saying no.
[03:39:28.403 --> 03:39:30.204]  The people of South Korea are saying no.
[03:39:30.204 --> 03:39:33.267]  Over half a million of them signed a petition saying no.
[03:39:33.267 --> 03:39:37.690]  And from what I've seen out of this story, it looks like the government is listening.
[03:39:37.690 --> 03:39:46.438]  They're going to cancel this ridiculous thing where you can just turn up as a tourist and then claim asylum on this South Korean island and then get shipped to the mainland.
[03:39:47.018 --> 03:39:50.821]  Looks like from the noises that they're making they're going to stop this program.
[03:39:50.821 --> 03:39:54.963]  And South Korea has said no to mass Islamic immigration.
[03:39:54.963 --> 03:39:57.065]  That's not going to be in the news.
[03:39:57.065 --> 03:39:59.927]  It was in Deutsch Well, which is a German publication.
[03:39:59.927 --> 03:40:02.048]  It was in, I think, the Korea Times.
[03:40:02.048 --> 03:40:07.552]  You don't see any discussion of this in a lot of big Western mainstream media publications, do you?
[03:40:07.552 --> 03:40:08.412]  Well, no.
[03:40:08.412 --> 03:40:11.034]  Because they can't frame it as Islamophobia.
[03:40:11.034 --> 03:40:13.536]  They can't frame it as white supremacy.
[03:40:14.256 --> 03:40:18.877]  Or the far right, because it's happening in South Korea.
[03:40:18.877 --> 03:40:21.198]  Absolutely fascinating story.
[03:40:21.198 --> 03:40:31.940]  But again, par for the course when it comes to Asian countries, which obviously have very, very limited skilled immigration, which is what a lot of European countries want.
[03:40:31.940 --> 03:40:40.202]  And on that very subject, Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini calls for anti-immigration alliance across Europe.
[03:40:40.985 --> 03:40:54.230]  Of course he's the leader of the Liga party in Italy which recently came to power and is basically turning the boats back in Libya, stopping the taxi service, literally picking them up from 10 miles off the Libyan coast.
[03:40:54.230 --> 03:41:08.495]  So he spoke to 50,000 supporters at the Liga Nord party conference recently and said, quote, I think of a League of Leagues in Europe which unites all the free movements that want to defend their borders and the well-being of their children.
[03:41:09.088 --> 03:41:17.253]  So he's already got common cause in many European countries right now, including Poland, Austria, Czech Republic, the Visegrad countries.
[03:41:17.253 --> 03:41:22.596]  So there really is a split between the likes of Germany and France, old Europe and Italy.
[03:41:22.596 --> 03:41:24.517]  And he's calling for that to be cemented.
[03:41:25.991 --> 03:41:32.796]  As we saw in Germany where Merkel's interior minister basically revolted against her open border policies.
[03:41:32.796 --> 03:41:35.939]  It almost led to the collapse of Merkel's government.
[03:41:35.939 --> 03:41:42.023]  Now they've come to an agreement where they've basically closed the borders in Germany to a lot of these refugees.
[03:41:42.023 --> 03:41:49.629]  So everything is moving in the right direction in terms of border security and safety for a lot of European countries, which is why I say on a regular basis
[03:41:50.269 --> 03:41:53.172]  A lot of good news coming out of Europe right now.
[03:41:53.172 --> 03:41:57.576]  Not so much good news coming out of Paris, which is now a complete dump.
[03:41:57.576 --> 03:42:02.641]  Thieves rip gold teeth from man's mouth on streets of troubled Paris no-go zone.
[03:42:02.641 --> 03:42:07.986]  Remember back in, I think it was 2015, after Charlie Hebdo, the mainstream media said,
[03:42:08.684 --> 03:42:10.486]  Oh, there are no no-go zones in Paris?
[03:42:10.486 --> 03:42:11.726]  What are you talking about?
[03:42:11.726 --> 03:42:21.474]  Well, a 37-year-old man was the victim of a brutal attack Friday night in a Paris suburb when several people robbed him of his phone and ripped out four of his gold teeth.
[03:42:21.474 --> 03:42:22.675]  Now, these teeth are worth about...
[03:42:24.363 --> 03:42:32.670]  €50 each is about $58, so they just ripped out four of his teeth, basically, so they could get their hands on $200 or less.
[03:42:32.670 --> 03:42:34.311]  Paris is a total dump.
[03:42:34.311 --> 03:42:40.196]  They've literally got migrants on the streets, on mattresses, uh, soaring crime, sexual assaults.
[03:42:40.196 --> 03:42:41.697]  They made the wrong decision.
[03:42:41.697 --> 03:42:47.142]  Salvini, Italy, made the right decision, and hopefully other European countries will do the same.
[03:42:47.142 --> 03:42:48.423]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live.
[03:42:48.423 --> 03:42:50.044]  We'll be back inforwars.com.

[03:47:28.882 --> 03:47:30.423]  War Room is coming up next.
[03:47:30.423 --> 03:47:38.048]  Before we get into a few final headlines, I want to tell you about the great 4th of July super sale at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:47:38.843 --> 03:47:48.828]  We're taking our country back from the hands of the globalist elite, and boy are they panicked about it, to celebrate how far we've come since the election of President Trump and the progress of this new American Revolution.

[03:48:48.801 --> 03:48:56.027]  They don't want you getting these products because again, we're not dependent on big fat checks from globalists like George Soros.
[03:48:56.027 --> 03:49:03.674]  We're not dependent on a Middle Eastern dictatorship funding us in return for free propaganda like CNN does.
[03:49:03.674 --> 03:49:06.456]  We're responsible and we're only behind
[03:49:07.637 --> 03:49:08.277]  We're good to go.
[03:49:38.897 --> 03:49:41.700]  Go for a few final news stories here.
[03:49:41.700 --> 03:49:43.061]  Now this story out of the UK.
[03:49:43.061 --> 03:49:49.148]  Westminster officials banned Trump from meeting Nigel Farage during UK presidential visit.
[03:49:49.148 --> 03:49:59.078]  The Prime Minister's staff organising next week's working visit are working to prevent President Donald Trump from having a meeting with Brexit leader Nigel Farage according to claims made Tuesday.
[03:49:59.807 --> 03:50:00.107]  I don't know.
[03:50:15.865 --> 03:50:21.149]  Basically betrayed, torn up and incinerated the democratic mandate of the British people.
[03:50:21.149 --> 03:50:24.372]  That's what Theresa May should be concentrating on.
[03:50:24.372 --> 03:50:31.678]  Instead, she's apparently, according to this report, concentrating on deciding who Nigel Farage can meet in his spare time.
[03:50:31.678 --> 03:50:34.760]  No, stick to what you were elected for.
[03:50:34.760 --> 03:50:37.622]  Stick to what we voted for back two years ago.
[03:50:37.622 --> 03:50:42.146]  Stop pussyfooting around deciding what Nigel Farage and Donald Trump get up to.
[03:50:43.109 --> 03:50:44.510]  None of your business!
[03:50:44.510 --> 03:50:50.353]  Donald Trump can meet whoever the hell he wants while he's here in his own spare private time.
[03:50:50.353 --> 03:50:55.855]  Meanwhile, Cameron personally requested Obama's back-of-the-queue Brexit warning.
[03:50:55.855 --> 03:51:07.181]  The former key aide to Barack Obama has confirmed David Cameron, former Prime Minister of Britain of course, personally asked the US President to warn Britain would be back-of-the-queue for a post-Brexit trade deal.
[03:51:07.825 --> 03:51:19.428]  Ben Rhodes, an ex-White House advisor, admitted Mr. Obama's dramatic intervention in the EU referendum campaign came at the personal request of the former Prime Minister.
[03:51:19.428 --> 03:51:28.270]  Which of course happened in April 2016, just two months before the Brexit vote, where Obama gave the speech and said the UK is going to be at the back of the queue.
[03:51:28.270 --> 03:51:31.510]  Well, it turns out that wasn't the case, because you lost.
[03:51:31.510 --> 03:51:32.951]  Hillary Clinton lost.
[03:51:32.951 --> 03:51:34.231]  But again, what does this tell us?
[03:51:35.020 --> 03:51:39.281]  Foreign meddling interfering with the democratic process.
[03:51:39.281 --> 03:51:41.041]  That's literally what we have here.
[03:51:41.041 --> 03:51:47.303]  Actual proof of a foreign power meddling in our sovereign democratic process.
[03:51:47.303 --> 03:51:49.123]  I'm not talking about Russian collusion.
[03:51:49.123 --> 03:51:58.205]  I'm talking about Barack Obama scheming with David Cameron to meddle in our democratic process in the UK when it came to Brexit.
[03:51:58.205 --> 03:52:02.707]  Bombshell admitted proof of foreign collusion.
[03:52:02.707 --> 03:52:04.187]  Is anybody talking about that now?
[03:52:04.867 --> 03:52:05.587]  No.
[03:52:05.587 --> 03:52:07.008]  Nobody's talking about it.
[03:52:07.008 --> 03:52:09.809]  They're still talking about this Mueller investigation.
[03:52:09.809 --> 03:52:14.391]  Admitted proof of foreign collusion, right there, bang in your face.
[03:52:14.391 --> 03:52:22.334]  Meanwhile, talking about Trump, and this ties into Trump because we've got his visit next week in the UK, not an official state visit because
[03:52:23.180 --> 03:52:28.323]  Basically, the Conservative government is scared that everyone will freak out, which they will, because they're complete idiots.
[03:52:28.323 --> 03:52:29.683]  There'll be protests.
[03:52:29.683 --> 03:52:32.745]  There may indeed be small-scale riots.
[03:52:32.745 --> 03:52:35.266]  But over in Turkey, this ties into it.
[03:52:35.266 --> 03:52:38.307]  Istanbul police shoot rubber bullets and tear gas.
[03:52:38.307 --> 03:52:42.269]  Sick dogs on gay pride marches in Istanbul.
[03:52:42.269 --> 03:52:44.910]  So they banned the gay pride march again.
[03:52:44.910 --> 03:52:49.993]  The 16th annual gay pride march, like they did for the past four years in Istanbul, Turkey.
[03:52:50.746 --> 03:52:53.107]  It attracted 100,000 people in 2014.
[03:52:53.107 --> 03:52:55.687]  This year, 10,000 people showed up.
[03:52:55.687 --> 03:52:58.068]  In fact, only 1,000 showed up.
[03:52:58.068 --> 03:52:58.988]  And what did they do?
[03:52:58.988 --> 03:53:04.849]  They used tear gas, they used rubber bullets, they used dogs to try to disperse the crowd.
[03:53:04.849 --> 03:53:06.950]  Erdogan's thugs also brought out the police dogs.
[03:53:06.950 --> 03:53:08.310]  They broke it up.
[03:53:08.310 --> 03:53:11.471]  Basically pointed guns at the protesters.
[03:53:11.471 --> 03:53:14.312]  The video's over at Gateway Pundit if you want to watch it.
[03:53:14.312 --> 03:53:15.832]  Who's going to be protesting that?
[03:53:16.900 --> 03:53:17.941]  Nobody!
[03:53:17.941 --> 03:53:23.343]  Is the LGBT lobby in London going to march on the Turkish embassy in London?
[03:53:23.343 --> 03:53:23.963]  No, they're not.
[03:53:23.963 --> 03:53:35.329]  They're going to be protesting against Donald Trump, a guy who literally appoints gay people to high positions of influence within his administration, as we saw with the ambassador a couple of months ago.
[03:53:35.869 --> 03:53:42.670]  They're going to be protesting the guy who literally waves a rainbow flag around on stage, which happened during his campaign.
[03:53:42.670 --> 03:53:57.733]  Are they going to be protesting against a government, against a belief system that persecutes gays on a regular basis, that fires tear gas at them, that fires rubber bullets at them, that sicks dogs at them, simply for trying to get out on the streets and have a parade?
[03:53:57.733 --> 03:53:58.193]  No.
[03:53:58.193 --> 03:53:59.653]  They don't give a damn about that.
[03:53:59.653 --> 03:54:03.394]  They give a damn about Trump because they've got Trump derangement syndrome.
[03:54:03.394 --> 03:54:04.714]  They're told what to think.
[03:54:05.094 --> 03:54:11.018]  Nobody's going to be protesting the anti-gay persecution of people in Istanbul, Turkey, are they?
[03:54:11.018 --> 03:54:13.680]  Nobody's going to be marching on the Saudi embassy.
[03:54:13.680 --> 03:54:16.842]  Nobody's going to be marching on the Turkish embassy.
[03:54:16.842 --> 03:54:19.523]  Complete hypocrisy through and through.
[03:54:19.523 --> 03:54:23.065]  Another story out of Breitbart here.
[03:54:23.065 --> 03:54:24.686]  In fact, we've got a clip that we can play.
[03:54:24.686 --> 03:54:26.948]  This is the Polish lawmaker clip.
[03:54:27.572 --> 03:54:35.679]  Where he basically takes on Cathy Newman, her of, so what you're saying is, fame, with Jordan Peterson, the living meme.
[03:54:35.679 --> 03:54:44.646]  He takes her on, again, she tries to guilt trip him for the fact that Poland hasn't accepted huge swaths of refugees, and she comes off second best.
[03:54:44.646 --> 03:54:46.327]  Let's go to this clip.
[03:54:46.327 --> 03:54:53.453]  Let me just ask, Mr. Tuchinsky, how many refugees has Poland taken?
[03:54:53.453 --> 03:54:53.713]  Zero.
[03:54:54.767 --> 03:54:56.489]  And you're proud of that?
[03:54:56.489 --> 03:55:06.257]  If you're asking me about Muslims' illegal immigration, none, not even one, will come to Poland.
[03:55:06.257 --> 03:55:08.018]  Not even one if it's illegal.
[03:55:08.018 --> 03:55:13.643]  We took over 2 million Ukrainians who are working, who are peaceful in Poland.
[03:55:13.643 --> 03:55:17.226]  We will not receive even one Muslim because this is what we promised.
[03:55:17.506 --> 03:55:20.189]  Did I ask not about illegal immigrants?
[03:55:20.189 --> 03:55:21.831]  I asked about refugees.
[03:55:21.831 --> 03:55:26.217]  And Jean-Claude Juncker, the Commission President, says that you're racist.
[03:55:26.217 --> 03:55:29.381]  You sound proud of the fact that you haven't taken any refugees.
[03:55:31.508 --> 03:55:35.251]  Of course, because this is what our people are expecting from our government.
[03:55:35.251 --> 03:55:36.491]  That's number one.
[03:55:36.491 --> 03:55:39.694]  This is why our government was elected.
[03:55:39.694 --> 03:55:42.315]  This is why Poland is so safe.
[03:55:42.315 --> 03:55:47.319]  This is the reason why we have not even one terrorist attack.
[03:55:47.319 --> 03:55:48.840]  Look at the streets in Poland.
[03:55:48.840 --> 03:55:53.423]  And we can be called populists, nationalists, racists.
[03:55:53.423 --> 03:55:54.363]  I don't care.
[03:55:54.363 --> 03:55:56.685]  I care about my family and about my country.
[03:55:57.978 --> 03:56:04.240]  Not many terrorist attacks in Poland, not many giant grooming gangs sweeping the country in Poland are there.
[03:56:04.240 --> 03:56:05.821]  That's interesting, isn't it?
[03:56:05.821 --> 03:56:19.385]  And of course the media, and in that case Cathy Newman, used the term refugees when they know, they know that even according to the UN's own figures, the vast majority of these people who they call refugees are not refugees, they're economic migrants.
[03:56:19.705 --> 03:56:27.088]  They can only afford to pay the criminal people smugglers in the first place because they've at least got some wealth within their own countries.
[03:56:27.088 --> 03:56:28.528]  They're not refugees.
[03:56:28.528 --> 03:56:38.712]  They're trying to flee to the European welfare states and in fact in the process harming their own countries because a lot of them are essentially middle class within those countries and they're fleeing.
[03:56:38.712 --> 03:56:40.813]  Absolutely incredible situation.
[03:56:40.813 --> 03:56:43.654]  But the resistance against it is building.
[03:56:43.654 --> 03:56:44.954]  Here's a story out of Germany.
[03:56:44.954 --> 03:56:48.656]  Thousands of Germans protest against Merkel and migration in Cottbus.
[03:56:49.316 --> 03:56:55.683]  After several migrant-related incidents, the people of Cottbus took to the streets Sunday to protest against Merkel's migration policy.
[03:56:55.683 --> 03:57:04.313]  German community organisation protesters throughout the city with demonstrators calling out, Merkel must leave, we are the people, and deport.
[03:57:05.009 --> 03:57:07.510]  So there are huge protests going on against this.
[03:57:07.510 --> 03:57:21.513]  We have the situation in Italy with Salvini, where him and the Five Star Movement, the coalition government, are hugely popular for instituting these measures whereby they at least have some sense of border security and sovereignty.
[03:57:21.513 --> 03:57:23.574]  The populist wave is sweeping Europe.
[03:57:23.574 --> 03:57:27.675]  You cannot stop it at this point by merely invoking the words racist.
[03:57:28.513 --> 03:57:30.876]  Or populist or nationalist.
[03:57:30.876 --> 03:57:31.696]  It doesn't work.
[03:57:31.696 --> 03:57:36.021]  People have rejected your globalism and that rejection is only going to build.
[03:57:36.021 --> 03:57:38.864]  That's going to wrap it up for the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:57:38.864 --> 03:57:42.387]  War Room with Owen Schroer is coming up live in 4Wars.com.
[03:57:43.519 --> 03:57:45.461]  This 4th of July is special.
[03:57:45.461 --> 03:57:47.463]  Everybody can see it, they can feel it.
[03:57:47.463 --> 03:57:51.907]  The globalists are attempting to kill a worldwide awakening to their tyranny.
[03:57:51.907 --> 03:57:56.270]  And America, yet again, is at the heart of the resistance of the globalists.
[03:57:56.270 --> 03:58:01.375]  That's why this 4th of July I'm asking all of our great supporters to think about Infowars now more than ever.
[03:58:01.375 --> 03:58:05.118]  And what would the world be like if Infowars wasn't there resisting the globalists?
[03:58:05.979 --> 03:58:08.261]  What would have happened if you hadn't supported InfoWars?
[03:58:08.261 --> 03:58:10.202]  We would not be having the victories we have today.
[03:58:10.202 --> 03:58:13.365]  So yes, a lot of good things are happening, but the enemy is striking back.
[03:58:13.365 --> 03:58:20.510]  So please, think about InfoWars and funding our operation while you get great products at the same time on the 4th of July that's so historic.
[03:58:20.510 --> 03:58:22.372]  We have record sales going on right now.
[03:58:23.348 --> 03:58:29.672]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from InfoWars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[03:58:29.672 --> 03:58:29.852]  It's you!
[03:58:53.683 --> 03:58:56.186]  That's why you've been on the team supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[03:58:56.186 --> 03:58:57.507]  You are the InfoWar.
[03:58:57.507 --> 03:59:00.490]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[03:59:14.844 --> 03:59:26.231]  Let everyone go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[03:59:26.231 --> 03:59:34.195]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the Infowars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[03:59:34.195 --> 03:59:41.239]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[03:59:41.239 --> 03:59:43.981]  We are the renaissance and we are winning!
[03:59:47.219 --> 03:59:49.852]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
