[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.620]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.020]   >> Well, here we are, July 5th,
[00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.780]   2018, another epic July 4th has
[00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.060]   come and gone.
[00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.080]   And never has it been more clear
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.320]   where the stakes are for humanity.
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.720]   But I want to make a point.
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.600]   There's a Churchill quote,
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.700]   I'm paraphrasing it, that many
[00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.480]   people get hit by history.
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.880]   They get run over in the street by
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.300]   huge, big, epic developments.
[00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.820]   And they kind of dust themselves
[00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.440]   off and ignore the point in history
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.280]   that they're in.
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.960]   But there are other people that get
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:38.900]   hit by destiny and
[00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.220]   hit by history.
[00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.040]   And they get up and
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.680]   it changes the course of their lives
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.280]   and countless other people's lives.
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.200]   And so I want people to remember
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.920]   that the hundreds of millions that
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.120]   died under communism and
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.620]   the tens of millions that died
[00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.220]   under fascism and other cults and
[00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.660]   permutations of governmental
[00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.200]   control.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.840]   And societal mental illness,
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.500]   manifest by government,
[00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.440]   that we are on the precipice of
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.240]   a new global revolution and
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.920]   a new renaissance.
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.680]   And we're actually, because of
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.480]   other people's work before us,
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.240]   sitting on a great brain trust of
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.680]   human liberty.
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.480]   And that we've got a chance to
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.320]   fight for freedom when the odds
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.000]   are actually on our side if we
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.760]   realize it.
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.800]   We've got to look back on those
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.640]   that didn't have a chance to win,
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.400]   but took action and did what was
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.160]   right because it was about their
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.000]   soul and about the spiritual,
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.200]   cultural, human decision they were
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.200]   making, and that's why they were
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.960]   fulfilled.
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.840]   So again, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.200]   I want to thank you all for
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.040]   your support.
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.200]   I want to thank you all for
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.920]   your prayers.
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.240]   I want to thank you all for
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.700]   what you've done against the
[00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.400]   bullies and the peer pressure over
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.960]   the years.
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.500]   Because if it wasn't for you, and
[00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.360]   if it wasn't for everything you've
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.760]   done, we wouldn't be here.
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.160]   Many of those people aren't here
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.000]   today that stood up for
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.360]   what was right.
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.360]   But in their gut, they believed in
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.240]   you, and they believed in me, and
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.040]   they believed that we could build
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.040]   a better future.
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.840]   They had goodwill towards people.
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.400]   They didn't want to use the fact
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.000]   that they had more knowledge than
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.640]   the average person to control that
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.160]   person.
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.760]   They didn't want to use the fact
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.400]   that they understood how the game
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.000]   was played to then set up a little
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.600]   secret cabal and feed on people.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.840]   They had the true vision of human
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.160]   empowerment and the true mastery
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.720]   to empower others and bring them to
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:26.920]   the next level.
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.960]   They were Christ-like in their
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.960]   duty, in their focus, in their
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.160]   sacrifice, in their commitment.
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.720]   And so that's why it's obnoxious,
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.120]   it's flagrant, it's arrogant,
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.800]   it's narcissistic, it's satanic.
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.840]   The victories we're having about
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.720]   Trump, or about Infowars, or
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.960]   about anybody else, it's about you,
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.520]   and your awakening, and
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.280]   the decisions you've made.
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.680]   So I just want to tell you,
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.520]   as we've passed through this July
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.280]   4th, 2018, as the globalists
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.720]   launched their riots, and
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.560]   their attacks, and their lies, and
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.320]   their moralizing, that have good
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.160]   cheer, my friends, because we're
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.720]   living in a time and age when
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.640]   the devil knows the time is short,
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.440]   so he sends the beast with wrath.
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.880]   And there are whole world
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.360]   government systems here,
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.600]   the mark of the beast.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.480]   It's going to be a lot of trials,
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.040]   a lot of tribulations, but
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.920]   we know the truth, and we know who
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.800]   wins, and we know where this all
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:19.280]   goes.
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.160]   And so, I'm going to tell you,
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.080]   that's a very positive fact to
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.000]   understand.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.920]   All that matters is what you stand
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:29.800]   for.
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.680]   All that matters is not being
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.480]   a coward, and not feeding on
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.800]   people that aren't as smart as you.
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.760]   And the minute you realize that,
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.800]   you're in God's arms forever, and
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.920]   these Satanists, and these crowley
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.880]   aides, and these Democrats, and
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.680]   these chi-coms, and all these
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.720]   control freaks who want to control
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.800]   reality, who want to try to become
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.640]   God, because they merge with AI
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.880]   technology, they don't understand,
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.680]   they already had a connection to
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.080]   God.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.840]   They were already an expression of
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.240]   God's consciousness in the
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.000]   universe, and there was no need to
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.040]   ever even do that.
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.840]   But that's why we have free will.
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.720]   Some people will fall to the lower
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:06.440]   dimension.
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.240]   Some people will rise and
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.480]   ascend towards a communion and
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.680]   a reunification with Christ.
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.320]   And that's the big choice, and
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.960]   that's why I know you've made
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:16.960]   the right choice.
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.400]   You're not going to find Christ in
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.680]   these whorehouse churches,
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.280]   where the literal globalists run
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.000]   the operation via the World Council
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.720]   of Churches.
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.480]   But you're going to find the real
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.520]   Christ in your heart, seeking after
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.120]   God and saying, I want to be
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.000]   a good person, I want to be just,
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.360]   I want to be honorable,
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.480]   I'm going to tell the truth.
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.280]   So again, are those of us here when
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.120]   we're seeing this great awakening
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.800]   of heroes?
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.360]   No, the heroes are those in
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.400]   Communist China, and North Korea,
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.920]   and old Soviet Russia, and
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.880]   countless other places like Cuba,
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.880]   that were tortured, and murdered,
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:48.840]   and killed, and
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.640]   imprisoned because they didn't
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.760]   deny God the truth.
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.360]   And to them on this July 4th,
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.720]   I want to thank you all and
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.600]   thank you for 1776 Worldwide.

[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.300]   the new renaissance and

[00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.560]   the globalist.
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.160]   As humanity prepares to face
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.880]   the next level of challenges,
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.840]   we are surpassing the globalists at
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.560]   this point at every level, but
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.760]   they are in their death throes.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.560]   They are striking back with

[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.920]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.200]   Progressives scramble to block
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.500]   potential Supreme Court nominee

[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.960]   Of course he is, and now he's
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.280]   facing 10 years in prison with his
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.520]   ironic glasses.
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:57.240]   We've got so
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.560]   much to break down here.
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.400]   We've got Brian Ross is leaving
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.720]   ABC News after botched
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.600]   Michael Flynn report, where he
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:05.480]   lied and said,
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.400]   Flynn admits he's a Russian agent
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.840]   and it's all coming out.
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.200]   Trump is a Russian agent,
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:10.920]   total hoax.
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.280]   Joy Behar, just got the news, yay.
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.720]   Trump's a Russian agent,
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:15.560]   total proof.
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.160]   Tom Arnold, his lawyer admits
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.560]   they're Russian agents,
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.560]   I'm going to have him on, total lie.
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:21.640]   Hoaxing, hoaxing,
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:22.920]   hoaxing by the hoaxers.
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.800]   Otto warns that the existence of
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.760]   the UN, EU, and NATO, that means

[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:29.800]   that's AP.
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:34.720]   We got all these Republicans and
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.720]   Trump officials being harassed
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:37.640]   everywhere.
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.280]   Scott Pruitt becomes the latest
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.040]   official to be harassed at the EPA
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:42.040]   at a restaurant.
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.600]   It's all coming out, and
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.560]   there's a secret Roe v Wade film
[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.400]   filming right now with a lot of
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.600]   top stars shooting in New Orleans.
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:50.960]   I hadn't heard anything about that.
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:54.240]   So we're going to be getting into
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.480]   all of those corollary issues, but
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.520]   let me, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.520]   let me give you the biggest news
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.760]   concerning the fight with the deep
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.600]   state that I have covered in
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.960]   this program, and
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:08.320]   the fight with the deep state that
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.920]   I have covered in a long, long time.
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.920]   I've got a lot of good contacts
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:17.280]   inside Trump world at the highest
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.280]   levels.
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:21.120]   And now that Kelly is receding
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.440]   towards being put out to pasture,
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.860]   those contacts have been heating up
[00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:27.760]   and have been particularly
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:28.960]   revealing.
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.520]   So let me give you bombshell,
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.800]   first look, information with myself
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.200]   and Roger Stone right now.
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.560]   It's on Infowars.com,
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.960]   it's on Newswars.com.
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.960]   I've tweeted it out as well.
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:47.480]   To Paul Joseph Watson's story,
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.080]   I relayed the information directly
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.560]   to him, Trump to go after Mueller
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.560]   for 9/11 Saudi cover up.
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.240]   Now you'll remember in January of
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.600]   this year, here is the Leanne
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.320]   McAdoo report on that next year's
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.480]   news today or the news of six
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.320]   months from now today.
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.640]   Mueller's 9/11 cover up,
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:08.480]   it's in action.
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.280]   There's Leanne McAdoo's report on
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.000]   that, it's been in local Florida
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.520]   papers and other places that
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.360]   Mueller ordered the cover up that
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.320]   Congress knew.
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.920]   FBI found direct ties between
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:19.840]   9/11 hijackers and Saudis living
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.840]   in Florida, Congress kept it dark.
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.400]   That's all the stuff we covered,
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.720]   how they got bin Laden out of
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.320]   the country, how they protected
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.880]   him, and who gave the orders in
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.640]   the Justice Department to do that?
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.240]   This goes to the Clintons,
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.000]   the Bushes, the Muellers,
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.440]   the Comey's, the entire deep state.
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.400]   Okay, so that is all about to come
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.080]   out, and so when you see some of
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.960]   the families of 9/11 victims on
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:46.440]   Tucker Carlson saying Mueller
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.680]   ordered that we couldn't have
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:51.120]   our lawsuit, he shut it down.
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.400]   He had the FBI not released
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.360]   the information.
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.240]   That is just the doorway to this.
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.040]   And so what I'm relaying to you is
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:58.920]   Trump, regardless of what the deep
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:10:59.640]   state does,
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.400]   it's just going to bring everything
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:02.960]   out, but he had to first get some
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.360]   Supreme Court justices in,
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.680]   turn the economy around,
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.160]   show everybody he was real.
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.920]   And now he's preparing to not drain
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:13.000]   the swamp, but basically napalm it,
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.360]   carpet bomb it.
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.240]   I mean, I don't know what you want
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.200]   to call this, but I have been told
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:19.760]   that this is the gateway to
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:20.760]   the traction.
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.480]   That's how Trump does it,
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:24.600]   he enters it at one irrefutable
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.760]   point that they covered up what
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:29.400]   happened on 9/11, that they blocked
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.320]   the lawsuits, that Mueller was
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.200]   the guy that quarterbacked all
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.200]   that, and then he quarterbacked
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.000]   the entire cover up brought in
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.560]   two days after 9/11.
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.160]   And that it goes into Saudi Arabia,
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:41.280]   it goes into the Bushes,
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.520]   it goes into the Clintons,
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:43.720]   who set it up beforehand.
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.220]   It goes into Saudi Arabia,
[00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:46.040]   Al Qaeda, and
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:48.000]   Trump has them dead to rights.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.080]   He has all the documents,
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.400]   he has all the admissions, and
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.480]   he's letting them know,
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.920]   I have the ace of spades.
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.480]   So just like Trump back, and
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.840]   we'll pull the clip up,
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.360]   during one of the debates,
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.600]   told Jeb Bush, yeah,
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.400]   your brother did a terrible job on
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:01.720]   9/11 standing down,
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.820]   the next day he dropped out.
[00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:05.000]   So we're going to play that clip
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:05.500]   coming up,
[00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:06.900]   the media criticized Trump.
[00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:08.400]   Trump famously called into CNN
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.100]   a week after 9/11 and said, boy,
[00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:11.860]   those buildings sure felt strange,
[00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:13.260]   like there was bombs in them.
[00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.140]   He wanted everything on record that
[00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:15.700]   he knew.
[00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:18.180]   So, Deep State working with radical
[00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:21.080]   criminal Islam, involved in 9/11,
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.940]   the stand down, all of it,
[00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:24.280]   the CIA building,
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.780]   building seven getting blown up.
[00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:28.480]   Trump is preparing, and
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.240]   he wants you to know, and
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.540]   wants us to know.
[00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:33.540]   And I am the individual that is
[00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:35.700]   supposed to say the super hard,
[00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:37.700]   dangerous things up front,
[00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:39.140]   I'm very honored.
[00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:40.860]   I've asked for that position,
[00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:42.660]   it's very honorable position,
[00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:44.260]   very dangerous position.
[00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:45.620]   But yeah, there's the video,
[00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:47.260]   Donald Trump 9/11 bombs exploded in
[00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:48.340]   the WTC towers, boom.
[00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:50.180]   So Trump's very smart laying his
[00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:52.060]   breadcrumbs to the point where he
[00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:54.100]   could turn around and go after him,
[00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:56.020]   he knows everything about this.
[00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:58.140]   So I bring you now for
[00:12:58.140 --> 00:12:59.840]   this segment, the next Roger Stone.
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.280]   Roger, I don't think we can hype
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.660]   this enough how big this is, and
[00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:05.960]   how huge this is.
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.920]   I called you last night at 1030
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.600]   after I got off the phone and
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.640]   then received the information.
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:13.080]   You said that you were getting
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.760]   concurrent info, and this is just
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.200]   the beginning of Trump's big
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.640]   rollout, his ace of spades.
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:18.960]   I mean, would you call this,
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.320]   the economy's his real ace of
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.920]   spades, and telling the truth is
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:22.720]   ace of spades.
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:24.560]   But when it comes to devastating
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.360]   the Deep State, this torpedo,
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:28.320]   this black arrow into the heart of
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.500]   smog, I mean, this is what needs to
[00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:32.680]   be done for justice, but it's also
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.680]   must strike complete fear into
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:35.760]   the Deep State.
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.560]   >> Well, I think the president is
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:41.220]   now only fully become aware of
[00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:44.000]   the extent of Robert Mueller's
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.320]   disastrous record as FBI director.
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:49.660]   It is indisputable that he
[00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:52.820]   systematically ignored multiple
[00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:55.440]   reports about a Sarasota,
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:58.280]   Florida flight school where five
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:00.760]   of nine Saudi hijackers were
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:01.800]   training for
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.800]   the assault on America on 9/11.
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:07.260]   There were multiple complaints from
[00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.840]   neighbors about strange activities
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:12.160]   among these men, who according to
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.260]   flight instructors showed an
[00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.600]   amazing interest in how to fly and
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.020]   take off, but no interest in how to
[00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:19.460]   land.
[00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:22.400]   This was reported to Jeb Bush's
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:24.320]   Florida Department of
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:27.000]   Law Enforcement, same thing as
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.920]   the state police in say, Louisiana
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:33.000]   or the Texas Rangers there in Texas.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.720]   Who complained repeatedly to
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:38.760]   the FBI, sent reports to the FBI,
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:42.060]   which Robert Mueller systematically
[00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:43.060]   ignored.
[00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:45.660]   So his role as being complicit in
[00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:47.600]   the cover up of 9/11 is
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:48.960]   demonstrable.
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:51.160]   The president himself is going to
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.200]   ultimately make the case, but
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:55.240]   it's the tip of the iceberg in
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.720]   terms of this quote unquote public
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.740]   servant who Lindsey Graham
[00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:02.060]   describes as beyond reproach.
[00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:04.600]   The first three suspects he
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:07.840]   arrested in the anthrax matter were
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.360]   the wrong men.
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:12.120]   The fourth man he ultimately
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:15.140]   arrested died mysteriously in
[00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:16.340]   custody.
[00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:19.000]   There is no question that he let
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.880]   three innocent men rot in a Boston
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.920]   jail in order to cover up FBI mafia
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.920]   informant sources in the Whitey
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.420]   Bulger matter.
[00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:32.640]   He had Jeffrey Epstein,
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:37.040]   the convicted pedophile on the FBI
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.800]   hook as an informant, which
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:44.840]   explains why Epstein was always
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:49.240]   able to escape more serious charges
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:50.960]   such as child trafficking.
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:52.520]   >> That's right, Robert Mueller is
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:54.100]   confirmed to be the main handler of
[00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:55.520]   the main child trafficking.
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.000]   You heard it here first.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:57.520]   We'll be back.
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:00.600]   >> If you like alkaline water or

[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:47.000]   ruled by a shadow government.

[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:03.880]   a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:05.680]   Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.200]   We have found an extraordinary
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:09.400]   new, natural way to alleviate
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.960]   seasonal distress symptoms,
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:13.080]   including promoting clear nasal
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:14.720]   and sinus passageways,
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:17.720]   eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:19.880]   In the 1960s, researchers in
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:21.760]   France noticed that people who ate
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:23.680]   certain quail eggs experienced
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.160]   less seasonal immune and
[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:26.920]   inflammatory responses.
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:28.640]   They began studying this effect in
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.880]   published trials, and decades later,
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:32.240]   we now have the fruit of this
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:34.080]   research, a fast-acting,
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.600]   chewable tablet that helps
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.960]   alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:39.680]   Pollen Block is natural and
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:40.560]   effective.
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.280]   It is not an antihistamine.
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:43.920]   In fact, current research has found
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:45.840]   that it actually acts by blocking
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:47.280]   the activity of tryptase,
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:49.080]   which is an enzyme that amplifies
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:51.200]   immune and inflammatory responses
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.240]   in the body.

[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.480]   two plus years ago,
[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:36.800]   telling Jeb Bush, you better watch
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:38.720]   it, buddy, after what you did
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:40.640]   standing down in Florida, and
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:42.800]   after what your brother did in DC.
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.320]   And now Trump is preparing to start
[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:45.720]   releasing the fact that the deep
[00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:47.160]   state was complicit working with
[00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:48.760]   radical Islam to carry out 9/11.
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:49.640]   Here's the President.
[00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:53.160]   >> Obviously, the war in Iraq was
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:56.120]   a big, fat mistake, all right?
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.600]   Now, you can take it any way you
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.120]   want, and it took Jeb Bush,
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:00.920]   if you remember, at the beginning
[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:02.480]   of his announcement, when he
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:04.400]   announced the President, took him
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.840]   five days, he went back.
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:06.720]   It was a mistake,
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:07.840]   it wasn't a mistake.
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:09.640]   Took him five days before his
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:11.640]   people told him what to say, and
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:14.440]   he ultimately said it was a mistake.
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.120]   The war in Iraq, we spent $2
[00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:18.080]   trillion, thousands of lives,
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:19.440]   we don't even have it.
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:20.960]   Iran is taking over Iraq with
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:22.840]   the second largest oil reserves in
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:23.720]   the world.
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:24.960]   Obviously, it was a mistake.
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.960]   So George Bush made a mistake,
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.640]   we can make mistakes, but
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:30.160]   that one was a beauty.
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:32.120]   We should have never been in Iraq,
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:33.360]   we have destabilized
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:34.360]   the Middle East.
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:36.320]   >> So you still think he should be
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:37.160]   impeached?
[00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:38.160]   >> I think it's my turn.
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:39.320]   >> You do whatever you want,
[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:40.760]   you call it whatever you want.
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.480]   I want to tell you, they lied.
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:43.680]   >> Okay. >> They said there were
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:45.000]   weapons of mass destruction,
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:45.960]   there were none, and
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.320]   they knew there were none.
[00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:49.040]   There were no weapons of mass
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.000]   destruction.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:50.720]   >> Okay, all right.
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.920]   >> And there's another clip too
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:55.320]   with him saying you screwed up on
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:58.000]   9/11, you stood down in Florida,
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.920]   your brother stood down,
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:01.760]   you guys did a terrible job.
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:02.640]   We're going to get that clip for
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:03.160]   you as well.
[00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:04.200]   We've also got the clip coming up
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:05.160]   in the next segment,
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.520]   where he talks about bombs in
[00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:07.280]   the buildings.
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:08.840]   So again, this is really,
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:10.000]   really serious.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   The point is,
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.920]   Tucker Carlson has on some of
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:14.880]   the families where Mueller on
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.640]   record basically killed
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:19.200]   the investigation, didn't let him
[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:20.720]   have the info to sue.
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.680]   And if you expand on that,
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:25.880]   we have the article on infowars.com,
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:28.160]   Trump to go after Mueller for
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:30.120]   9/11 Saudi cover up.
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:32.520]   President about to drop the hammer
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:34.380]   on former FBI director for
[00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:36.500]   burying Saudi involvement in
[00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:38.800]   the attacks, as Roger Stone just
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:41.000]   mentioned, but this is coffin
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.080]   nails, this is kryptonite to
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:44.800]   the deep state, Roger.
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:46.760]   And again, the specific thing that
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:48.320]   I want to relay to everyone is
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:50.320]   the exclusive here is, this is only
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:51.960]   the beginning of what Trump is
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:53.480]   going to start releasing.
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:54.600]   And he's the president,
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:55.880]   he has the right to declassify
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:56.920]   anything he wants, and
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:58.080]   he's letting them know.
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.280]   Let's just say folks are letting
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:02.440]   them know that that's going on.
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:04.240]   >> So what does that signify?
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.560]   What do you make of this
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:07.640]   development that this is starting
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:09.560]   and that folks want the deep state
[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:11.360]   to know we're coming for them?
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:13.760]   >> Well, I think the president is
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:16.440]   building the backfire necessary to
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:19.120]   terminate the partisan inquisition
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:21.360]   being led by Robert Mueller.
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:24.440]   I mean, that story in yesterday's
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:26.360]   or the day before his New York
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:28.360]   Times about Rod Rosenstein,
[00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:30.480]   who very clearly wrote a memo to
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:33.080]   the president advocating the firing
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:34.760]   of FBI Director Comey,
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.760]   did not think it would be made
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:37.440]   public.
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.400]   Trump, as it is prerogative,
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:40.520]   made it public.
[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:42.440]   This embarrassed Rosenstein in
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:44.320]   front of his deep state buddies
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:46.080]   where he was trying to have it
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:46.840]   both ways.
[00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:48.640]   He is furious at Trump and
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:51.040]   his payback is the appointment of
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:52.320]   Robert Mueller.
[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:54.240]   It is as clear as day.
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.560]   So he is acting in his
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:56.760]   self-interest.
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:59.080]   He has conflicts in that he has
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:02.160]   gotten his first job from Mueller.
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:04.200]   He has conflicts in that he
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:06.220]   approves the FISA warrant
[00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:07.280]   personally.
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:10.000]   He's more conflicted in this case
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.920]   than Jeff Sessions is.
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:13.640]   He needs to stand down or
[00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:15.320]   be terminated.
[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:18.120]   So I think the president is laying
[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:21.000]   the ground for the termination of
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.600]   what is a partisan witch hunt.
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:26.360]   People need to know more about
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:28.280]   Mr. Mueller.
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:30.520]   He is not the white knight that
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:32.680]   Lindsey Graham and others in
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.600]   the mainstream media have
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:36.840]   portrayed his role during and
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:39.440]   after the 9/11 matter needs to be
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:40.440]   examined.
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:42.680]   The fact that he is the man who
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:45.040]   mules the uranium specimens to
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:47.440]   Stockholm to close the deal for
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:49.540]   uranium-1 at behest of the
[00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:51.680]   Clintons shows that he is
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:53.920]   a bipartisan, a leg man for
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:55.280]   the deep state.
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:57.440]   And he is completely wrong.
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:59.720]   And he is complicit, therefore,
[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:02.200]   in the largest treasonous financial
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:04.140]   crime in terms of dollars in
[00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:05.600]   American history.
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:08.120]   >> And it's attempting to overthrow
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:09.720]   a duly elected president when we
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:11.320]   have the FBI Justice Department
[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:12.640]   conspiracy to keep him from
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:13.600]   getting elected.
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:14.560]   They try to stop him from
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:15.120]   getting in.
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:16.640]   They tried to not let the delegates
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:17.200]   be seated.
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:18.420]   Then they've been waging war
[00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:19.840]   against him, his whole family,
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:20.360]   you and I.
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:21.280]   Roger, I'll tell you,
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:22.640]   I called you last night about it.
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:24.120]   I've discovered whole new next
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:25.760]   level, Democratic Party has been
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:27.680]   caught red-handed in my personal
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:29.480]   life trying to actually wreck my
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:30.400]   family again.
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.360]   I mean, there is no end to these
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:34.400]   people, I've got to sue them now.
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:36.360]   They are so diabolical,
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:37.960]   they are so crazed.
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:40.840]   And then they use Alistair Crowley
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:43.120]   as the Democratic Party operating
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:43.800]   system.
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:46.040]   I mean, these people are beyond
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:47.800]   anything you could ever imagine.
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:48.800]   >> It is really,
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:50.560]   really extraordinary.
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:52.720]   But what tells me is Trump's
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.560]   taking the gloves off for
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:57.160]   so long, the early Trump attorneys
[00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:59.800]   piece of legal advice was bend over
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:01.840]   and hand Robert Mueller the
[00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:04.600]   vacillate, turn over everything,
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:07.080]   waive all executive privilege,
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:09.720]   give Mueller millions and millions
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:11.960]   and millions of privileges.
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:13.720]   >> Make him God, let him violate
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:14.760]   all these laws.
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:17.400]   >> Right, ignore his use of material
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:20.040]   from FISA warrants, which is still
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:22.840]   the linchpin of this whole scandal.
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:25.200]   What Rosenstein struggles to cover
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:27.240]   up today, what is being used to
[00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:29.320]   harass me and Paul Manafort and
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:30.000]   others.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.880]   So this tells me Trump is going to
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:35.320]   war, it is essential the American
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:36.800]   people know who and
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:38.400]   what Mr. Mueller is.
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:40.640]   It is not us claiming this,
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:42.640]   you can go online, look at
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:45.120]   the terrific story by Howie Carr
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.440]   about how Robert Mueller as US
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:50.160]   attorney let three Italian men rot
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:52.640]   in a jail who he knew had nothing
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:55.040]   to do with a mob murder there in
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:57.640]   order to cover up for paid mafia
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:59.720]   informants who work for
[00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:01.080]   Whitey Bulger.
[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:03.120]   That's extraordinary.
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:05.720]   >> And now the president is
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:07.200]   telegraphing that he's going to
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:08.600]   start releasing the cover up,
[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:09.880]   the standout on 9/11 that
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:11.080]   implicates the Bush's,
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:12.760]   Mueller who ran the cover up itself
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:14.440]   and the Clinton's.
[00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:15.960]   Because we know Trump is really
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:17.680]   upset behind the scenes that it's
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:19.480]   the Bush's and their syndicate that
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:21.200]   are more effectively fighting his
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.720]   agenda than even the Democrats
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:23.320]   right now.
[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:24.960]   And Chuck Todd now has come out and
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.600]   said President Trump is winning,
[00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:28.360]   Democrats reeling, close quote.
[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:30.240]   So Trump now knows who to target,
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.520]   doesn't he, Roger?
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:33.280]   >> Well, look, the poll that I
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:34.520]   would like to see,
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:36.120]   which nobody has taken,
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:38.000]   there is a new poll which shows
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.760]   the two top front runners of
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:42.240]   the Democratic Party, old, tired,
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:44.360]   sick, and bereft of ideas, but
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.400]   still just as greedy, Hillary
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:48.560]   Clinton, and Uncle Joe Biden,
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:50.480]   a man who is literally around
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:51.600]   the bend.
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:53.320]   A guy who keeps going around
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:55.320]   threatening physical violence
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:57.560]   against Donald Trump, when in fact
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:59.520]   Trump's got 20 pounds on him,
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:01.200]   a much longer reach, and
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.240]   in my opinion, could put Joe out
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:04.760]   in one shot, one shot,
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:05.960]   just an opinion.
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:08.960]   So these are their nominees.
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:10.920]   I'd like to see them stacked in
[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:12.360]   the legitimate poll,
[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:13.960]   Trump versus Hillary,
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:16.160]   Trump versus Biden for 2020.
[00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:17.640]   And I think you'd find the
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:20.040]   President would crush both of them.
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:21.680]   If he ran against Hillary again
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:23.400]   tomorrow, he would crush her by
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:24.400]   a larger margin.
[00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:25.480]   >> And that's why Michael Moore
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:26.680]   panicked, he went on Bill Maher
[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:27.600]   this weekend and said,
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:28.720]   we've got to have an uprising.
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:29.600]   A million people surround
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:30.680]   the Capitol, don't let the new
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:31.720]   Supreme Court pick you in.
[00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:33.440]   And he goes, because Trump's going
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:34.600]   to win in 2020, and
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:36.120]   America's coming back, and
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:38.040]   they are crapping their britches.
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:39.760]   >> No, you're absolutely right,
[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:41.400]   we need to have an uprising,
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.920]   circle their circle around
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:44.840]   the Capitol, demanding a Supreme
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:46.560]   Court justice who believe in
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:48.160]   the rule of law, be there,
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:50.000]   surround their surroundings.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.160]   That's my view.
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.200]   >> Let's do a few more minutes,
[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:53.200]   I want to play this clip of Trump
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:54.400]   talking about 9/11, and then ask
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:55.400]   you a few of the key questions
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:56.520]   straight ahead with Roger Stone.
[00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:57.240]   I'm Alex Jones.
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:01.080]   >> I tried other brands, but
[00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:02.880]   I came back to my sunshine.
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:03.920]   >> For the best hot or
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:05.760]   cold pain relief, get the best,
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.560]   get a Sunny Bay heating pad.
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:10.000]   >> Sometimes life can be a pain in
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.640]   the neck, or back, or shoulder.
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:13.880]   >> And the best relief for
[00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:15.520]   that pain is a Sunny Bay heating
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:15.960]   pad.
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:17.520]   Did you know that the American
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:19.120]   College of Physicians said that
[00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:20.560]   the best ways to treat muscle
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:22.120]   pain is heat therapy?
[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:23.560]   Sunny Bay heating pads are

[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:33.120]   >> Why take another pill?

[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:35.960]   heating pads alone and

[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:38.640]   >> Long distance travel or

[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:22.920]   Prebiotic fiber is soluble fiber
[00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:24.640]   that ferments in the gut to help
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:26.120]   feed good bacteria,
[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:28.080]   which helps you digest food,
[00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:29.440]   absorb nutrients, and
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:31.600]   even support your immune system.

[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:41.160]   Cheap prebiotic fibers are used up
[00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:43.080]   only at the beginning of the colon,
[00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:45.800]   but our premium organic acacia fiber
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:48.000]   is slowly digested by the good
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.120]   bacteria throughout the entire colon
[00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:53.680]   for maximum prebiotic effect.

[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:23.400]   >> You are listening to an

[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:29.560]   It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:30.880]   >> It was an architectural defect.
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:32.000]   You know, the World Trade Center was
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.080]   always known as a very,
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:34.000]   very strong building.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.480]   Don't forget, that took a big bomb in
[00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:36.040]   the basement.
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:37.160]   Now, the basement is the most
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:37.840]   vulnerable place,
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:39.360]   because that's your foundation.
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:40.800]   And it withstood that.
[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:42.640]   And I got to see that area about
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:44.520]   three or four days after it took
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:46.720]   place, because one of my structural
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:48.600]   engineers actually took me for
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:49.800]   a tour, because he did the building.
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:51.000]   And I said, I can't believe it.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.120]   The building was standing solid, and
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:55.160]   half of the columns were blown out.
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:55.920]   I mean, so
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:57.800]   this was an unbelievably powerful
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:58.920]   building.
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:00.440]   If you know anything about structure,
[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:01.680]   it was one of the first buildings that
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:02.800]   was built from the outside.
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:04.440]   The steel, the reason the World Trade
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:05.960]   Center had such narrow windows,
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:07.640]   is that in between all the windows,
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:09.200]   you had the steel on the outside.
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:10.280]   See, the steel on the outside of
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:10.840]   the building.
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:12.800]   That's why when I first looked, and
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:14.440]   you had big, heavy I-beams.
[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:15.800]   When I first looked at it,
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:17.760]   I couldn't believe it, because there
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:18.960]   was a hole in the steel.
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:20.480]   And this is steel that was,
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:22.520]   you remember the width of the windows
[00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:24.520]   of the World Trade Center, folks?
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:26.240]   I think if you were ever up there,
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:27.520]   they were quite narrow.
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:29.720]   And in between was this heavy steel.
[00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:31.400]   I said, how could a plane,
[00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:33.160]   even a plane, even a 767 or
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:35.480]   747, or whatever it might have been,
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:37.440]   how could it possibly go through
[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:38.240]   the steel?
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:39.880]   I happen to think that they had not
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:41.440]   only a plane, but they had bombs
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:43.400]   that exploded almost simultaneously.
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:44.800]   because I just can't imagine
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:46.440]   anything being able to go through
[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:47.040]   that wall.
[00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:48.480]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:49.680]   >> He's had the gall to go after
[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:50.200]   my mother.
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:51.440]   >> The World Trade Center came down
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:52.560]   during your brother's reign,
[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:53.240]   remember that.
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:54.720]   >> He's had the gall to go after my
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:55.240]   mother.
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:56.400]   >> That's not keeping the same.
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:57.960]   >> Look, I won the lottery when I
[00:34:57.960 --> 00:34:59.360]   was born 63 years ago, and
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:00.800]   looked up and I saw my mom.
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:01.960]   My mom is still alive.
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:03.920]   My mom is the strongest woman I
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:04.440]   know.
[00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:05.240]   >> She should be running.
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:06.600]   >> This is not about my family or
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:07.240]   his family.
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:09.160]   >> Okay.
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:10.640]   >> I'm putting a bookend on that,
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:12.080]   but there's Trump saying, and
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:13.480]   he owns a bunch of buildings in
[00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:14.680]   the area, and he talked to
[00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:15.960]   structural engineer, and
[00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:17.480]   he's telling you, I think there
[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:18.520]   were bombs in there.
[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:20.040]   Well, we have the local news with
[00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:21.560]   them removing bombs, reporting
[00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:23.000]   their bombs in the buildings,
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.240]   bombs in building seven,
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:25.360]   not hit by an airplane.
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:26.640]   Trump knows it all, and
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:28.400]   he's getting ready to bring it all
[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:28.900]   out.
[00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:31.000]   Now, segue, talking to Roger
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.200]   during the break, he's got a big
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:35.540]   announcement to make to everybody
[00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:37.800]   here about what Trump has decided
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:40.040]   to do, and why we see Kelly headed
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:42.400]   for the exits, reportedly he'll be
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:43.560]   gone July 31st.
[00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:44.380]   Roger Stone,
[00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:46.480]   explain what Trump's decided to do
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:48.000]   for everybody out there.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.640]   >> Well, first of all,
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:51.680]   there's so much going on.
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:53.280]   I point out that my book,
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:55.680]   The Bush Crime Family, came out 11
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:58.000]   days before that debate, in which
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.120]   Trump confronted Jeb about his
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:02.360]   stand down on 9/11.
[00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:05.400]   Now it will all come out.
[00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:08.200]   It is very important to know that
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:11.600]   one of those judges, Brett Kavanaugh,
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:14.440]   a Bush family favorite, who seems
[00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:17.160]   to be among the front runners for
[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:18.880]   the Supreme Court,
[00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:20.720]   has a minor problem.
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:22.960]   He is involved in the cover up of
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:24.720]   the Vince Foster death.
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:26.960]   Now, while it has never been
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:29.720]   established as to whether Foster,
[00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:31.320]   the top aide to Bill and
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:33.920]   Hillary Clinton, the keeper of all
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:36.600]   their secrets, murdered himself,
[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:38.760]   suicide, or was murdered,
[00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:41.420]   I tend to believe that he actually
[00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:43.120]   did commit suicide.
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:45.400]   However, his body was moved by
[00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:46.920]   Hillary Clinton and
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:49.320]   two of her henchmen to Fort Marcy
[00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:49.920]   Park.
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:52.080]   A man named Patrick Knowlton,
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:54.200]   just an honest citizen, was in
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:56.440]   the wrong place at the wrong time
[00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:58.760]   and saw things he shouldn't have
[00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:01.400]   seen, the dumping of Foster's body.
[00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:04.240]   And he was harassed by special
[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:06.880]   counsel Brett Kavanaugh,
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:09.840]   a cleanup man for the Clintons in
[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:12.920]   shutting down the investigation
[00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:16.040]   into how Vince Foster's body got to
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:17.680]   Fort Marcy Park.
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:19.040]   >> So we definitely don't want him,
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:20.440]   and we also know Napolitano could
[00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:21.240]   be in the running.
[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:22.920]   We also have this lady who is
[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:23.800]   a Christian.
[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:27.560]   That's Amy Connie Barrett.
[00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:28.680]   What do you think of her?
[00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:31.400]   >> Well, she is a stout Catholic.
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:33.720]   I'm worried about her not being as
[00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:36.040]   libertarian as perhaps I'd like.
[00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:37.800]   I'd like to see a libertarian on
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:39.240]   the judge, on the court,
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:41.240]   to balance the conservatives out.
[00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:42.840]   Judge Willett from Texas
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:44.440]   would be excellent.
[00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:46.360]   I'm coming to the conclusion that
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:47.720]   the President has come to
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:49.400]   the conclusion that although
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:51.080]   Napolitano is his emotional
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:53.200]   favorite, at his age he is probably
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:55.080]   too old for this appointment.
[00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:57.360]   And there's now discussion about
[00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:59.240]   the judge re-affirming,
[00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:01.440]   re-coming back as US Attorney
[00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:04.120]   General, an interesting concept.
[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:06.640]   >> Attorney General, that's right,
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:08.960]   because that's a two to four year
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:11.400]   post instead of, we want somebody
[00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:13.920]   young, that's why this lady would
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:14.680]   be great.
[00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:17.080]   >> And Napolitano is younger and
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:19.920]   more vigorous than Jeff Sessions,
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:22.320]   yet we get a younger jurist.
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:23.640]   I really worry,
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:26.200]   Kavanaugh is a Bush Republican,
[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:27.880]   in wolf's clothing,
[00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:29.760]   in sheep's clothing.
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:32.000]   His involvement with Vince Foster
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.280]   alone, his witness tampering on
[00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:36.120]   behalf of the deep state,
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:38.760]   these matters should eliminate him.
[00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:40.600]   But it's important that Info
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:42.600]   Warriors not allow him to pose as
[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:44.360]   just a solid conservative.
[00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:45.800]   >> Now, in your own words,
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:47.320]   what you said to me during
[00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:49.320]   the break when I told you about my
[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:51.240]   conversation last night, and
[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:52.920]   we also talked last night,
[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:54.840]   you said Trump has decided to,
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:56.120]   in your own words.
[00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:57.680]   >> Take the gloves off,
[00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:00.080]   I think he's going on offense.
[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:01.080]   I think, look,
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:03.320]   the two Bloomberg stories this week
[00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:04.840]   I think told the story.
[00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:06.200]   >> You said Trump's going to war.
[00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:07.720]   >> He's going to war,
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:10.120]   because the story that says now
[00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:12.560]   Robert Mueller, according to
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:14.640]   Bloomberg, will focus on
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:16.320]   Russian collusion.
[00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:17.320]   Pardon me?
[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:18.560]   He's had two years and
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:19.880]   spent $17 million.
[00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:22.040]   I thought that was what he was
[00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:23.000]   focused on.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.880]   He's turned up nothing, but
[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:26.960]   this one case is turning out to be
[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:28.640]   an embarrassment to him.
[00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:31.080]   The 13 Russians that he can't
[00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:32.080]   convict and
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:34.480]   who are demanding discovery.
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:36.440]   Then in a second story,
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:38.920]   it said he will make decisions
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:42.080]   about charges against the President,
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:44.960]   which would have to be included in
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:47.520]   his final report in the fall,
[00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:48.680]   in October.
[00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:50.200]   Get it, Alex?
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:52.920]   October, just before the election
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:53.760]   >> Correct.
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:54.800]   >> October.
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:57.720]   So their game plan is clear.
[00:39:57.720 --> 00:39:59.760]   Anyone who thinks this guy is
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:01.200]   giving up is wrong.
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:03.240]   He is a deep state hit man on
[00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:04.200]   a mission.
[00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:06.640]   I am being persecuted specifically
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:08.720]   because of my role in exposing
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:10.520]   the corruption of Bill and
[00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:11.900]   Hillary Clinton and
[00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:13.820]   Clinton's war on women and
[00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:15.720]   the crimes of the Bushes.
[00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:18.160]   It's a two party vendetta to get
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:20.280]   me because of my support for
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:21.440]   Donald Trump.
[00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:24.000]   That's why I'm being harassed.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.240]   That's why my fourth amendments
[00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:28.040]   are being violated as they
[00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:29.120]   interrogate.
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:30.760]   >> You've been banned off Twitter.
[00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:32.400]   They've admittedly hacked into
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:33.160]   your emails.
[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:34.720]   Now Skype says you've been banned.
[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:37.560]   >> The US Senate wants every email
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:39.000]   between Roger Stone and
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:39.840]   Alex Jones.
[00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:41.400]   That's something they've
[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:43.080]   specifically asked for, and
[00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:44.080]   they shall have.
[00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:45.400]   It is all benign.
[00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:47.640]   You'll find no Russian meddling.
[00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:49.040]   You'll find a lot of truth telling.
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:52.000]   And we'll find like here's your
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.280]   plane tickets or here's that.
[00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:55.320]   But it's such a violation.
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:56.840]   >> What's the name of that great
[00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:58.560]   barbecue place again that we're
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:00.080]   going to, that kind of thing?
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:01.640]   >> That's actually what's in there.
[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:02.160]   Yeah.
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:03.560]   My gosh.
[00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:04.720]   All right, Roger.
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:05.520]   Thank you so much.
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:06.960]   Have a great Fourth of July.
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:08.040]   Trump is going to war.
[00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:08.920]   We're all in a war.
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:09.480]   God bless you.
[00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:13.200]   >> Very special, special news at
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:15.160]   the war room tonight,
[00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:18.240]   assuming that we can solve our
[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:19.320]   problem with Skype.
[00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:21.640]   It's extraordinary the extent to
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:23.320]   which the deep state and
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:25.440]   the tech left is going to harass
[00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:26.280]   me, Alex.
[00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:28.160]   All of my Skype platforms closed
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:30.080]   down today without explanation,
[00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:32.000]   which is why I reach you by phone.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.800]   Twitter is manipulating
[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:36.120]   the algorithms at the Stone Cold
[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:37.880]   Truth Facebook page and
[00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:39.960]   my personal Facebook page.
[00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:41.640]   I post brilliance and
[00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:43.720]   I get back three reposts.
[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:44.400]   >> Well, I mean,
[00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:45.800]   we have the internal documents.
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:46.960]   They're doing this to everybody
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:47.600]   who's affected.
[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:48.800]   That's why everybody's going to
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:49.760]   work even harder.
[00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:50.800]   So by word of mouth,
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:51.840]   spread the word about
[00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:53.600]   Infowars.com, Newswars.com,
[00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:55.000]   StoneColdTruth.com.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.400]   Roger, have a great Fourth and
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:57.880]   we'll see you tonight on the war
[00:41:57.880 --> 00:41:59.080]   room one way or another.
[00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:00.720]   >> Most excellent, many thanks,
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:01.240]   Alex.
[00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:02.240]   >> Thank you.
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:03.360]   When we come back,
[00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:05.240]   Paul wrote a great article with
[00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:06.360]   the inside intel.
[00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:08.160]   We gave you a kit, done one with
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:09.480]   some points I added.
[00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:11.360]   It's on Infowars.com,
[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:12.680]   Newswars.com.
[00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:14.400]   Please get this out.
[00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:15.320]   This is huge.
[00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:18.080]   Trump threatens to release 911
[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:20.120]   contacts implicating Clintons in
[00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:20.960]   the bushes.
[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:24.200]   Trump sends warning to deep state.
[00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:26.040]   We should probably just add Mueller,
[00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:27.160]   Clintons, Bushes and
[00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:28.400]   their minion Mueller.
[00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:29.600]   This is huge.
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:32.040]   And it's up on Infowars.com.
[00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:33.480]   So get that out to everybody.
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:34.280]   Now we're going to go to break.
[00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:35.880]   We come back.
[00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:38.480]   Abolish ICE vandals,
[00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:40.240]   throw brick through window of GOP
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:42.240]   offices, leave graffiti message.
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:44.160]   More Republicans confronted and
[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:45.840]   you've got more people being
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:47.880]   arrested for threatening to kill
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:49.880]   Rand Paul, goodness gracious.
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:51.600]   Think about Rand Paul's god,
[00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:52.800]   he's been shot at,
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:54.320]   a bunch of his ribs broken
[00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:55.760]   physically attacked.
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:58.440]   And now this.
[00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:01.360]   >> Living in volcano may sound more
[00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:03.400]   dramatic than it really is.
[00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:05.120]   The real drama can be found here
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:06.680]   in Leilani Estates.
[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:08.440]   But a lot of us on the big island
[00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:09.720]   rely on rainwater and
[00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:11.600]   we need to be concerned about ash
[00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:12.920]   and acid rain.
[00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:14.800]   Volcanic ash may contain heavy
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:16.440]   metal particles.
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:18.280]   And acid rain could lower the pH
[00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:20.240]   of the water to unhealthy levels.
[00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:21.080]   To find out,
[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:23.360]   we employed a series of tests for
[00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:26.720]   heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:28.000]   What we learned was that there was
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.800]   in fact unhealthy levels of heavy
[00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:30.400]   metals and
[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:32.400]   acidity in the rainwater.
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:34.320]   Next, we tested the water from our
[00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:36.320]   Alexa pure gravity filter.
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:37.880]   And not only were the heavy metal
[00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:40.000]   levels within safe measure, but
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.120]   the pH was also restored to
[00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:43.520]   optimal levels.
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:44.920]   As it turns out,
[00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:47.000]   the filter on the Alexa pure raises
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.840]   the pH of the water.
[00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:49.880]   So what we've learned is that
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:51.200]   volcanic ash and
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:52.800]   acid rain can contaminate
[00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:54.480]   a rainwater supply.
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:55.880]   But more importantly,
[00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:57.680]   a good water filtration system will
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:58.440]   purify it.
[00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:00.800]   >> As the years go by,
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:01.560]   it gets harder and
[00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:03.000]   harder to keep up with your body's
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.520]   nutritional needs.
[00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:05.920]   With changes in diet,
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:07.920]   unnatural ingredients, and stress,
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:09.120]   you may not be able to get all
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:11.480]   the necessary nutrients, amino acids,
[00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:13.960]   vitamins, and minerals needed daily.
[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:15.880]   That's why InfoWars Life created
[00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:17.920]   the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion
[00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:19.960]   formula, the new platinum standard

[00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:02.400]   >> We've taken thousands of years of
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:03.760]   known research and put it together
[00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:06.560]   with our own four years of seeking and
[00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:08.520]   testing to find the very best systems
[00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:09.960]   that God gave us through Mother Nature
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:11.280]   to detoxify the body.
[00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:13.280]   That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:16.160]   Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:17.600]   It's made in the USA.
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:19.920]   It's filled with known compounds from
[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:21.960]   nature that are absolutely associated
[00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:23.320]   with detoxifying the body and
[00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:24.440]   it supports the InfoWars.
[00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:26.560]   It is a classical 360 win.
[00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:28.800]   This is the formula that I personally
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:30.280]   have been taking for over a year.
[00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:32.080]   And now we believe we have come as
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:34.120]   close to perfection when it comes to
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:36.320]   a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:37.240]   You owe it to yourself,
[00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:38.280]   you owe it to your family,
[00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:40.280]   and you owe it to the future of this
[00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:42.160]   country and the world that patriots
[00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:44.040]   stay as healthy and as clean and
[00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:45.880]   as focused as you can be.
[00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:47.320]   Because we need you,
[00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:48.800]   the remnant of America,
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:50.480]   to reignite those brush fires to
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:52.040]   the next level and to be healthy and
[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:53.120]   as focused as you can be.
[00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:54.240]   Thanks to your support and
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:55.400]   your prayers, together,
[00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:56.440]   we're changing the world.
[00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:58.040]   Now it's time to change our bodies
[00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:00.880]   with Z-Shield at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:02.800]   This 4th of July is special.
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:03.680]   Everybody can see it,
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:04.800]   they can feel it.
[00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:06.320]   The globalists are attempting to
[00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:08.440]   kill a worldwide awakening to
[00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:09.240]   their tyranny.
[00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:10.680]   And America, yet again,
[00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:12.400]   is at the heart of the resistance,
[00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:13.600]   the globalists.
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:14.680]   That's why this 4th of July,
[00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:16.800]   I'm asking all of our great supporters
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:18.320]   to think about InfoWars now more
[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:19.480]   than ever. And what would the world
[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:21.480]   be like if InfoWars wasn't there
[00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:23.320]   resisting the globalists?
[00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:24.160]   What would have happened if you
[00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:25.600]   hadn't supported InfoWars?
[00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:26.960]   We would not be having the victories
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:27.480]   we have today.
[00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:28.960]   So yes, a lot of good things
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:29.520]   are happening, but
[00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:30.680]   the enemy is striking back.
[00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:33.280]   So please, think about InfoWars and
[00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:34.560]   funding our operation while you get
[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:36.080]   great products at the same time on
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:37.880]   this 4th of July that's so historic.

[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:26.160]   >> We're back live,
[00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:27.640]   broadcasting worldwide.
[00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:29.360]   I'm your host Alex Jones, and
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:31.120]   I want to open the phones up,
[00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:32.800]   coming up in the next hour to
[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:34.840]   discuss all the amazing things that
[00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:35.800]   are happening.
[00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:38.400]   And we have several guests joining
[00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:40.880]   us who were inside of the riot that
[00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:43.200]   the Antifa Democrat globalist
[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:45.840]   operative started in Portland over
[00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:47.880]   the weekend that even local
[00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:49.640]   newspapers admitted.
[00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:52.920]   The riot started when Antifa
[00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:57.280]   started throwing bricks, bottles,
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:48:00.600]   and fireworks at the crowd.
[00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:01.600]   And I've seen these explosives.
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:03.680]   What they're doing is the mortars
[00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:05.200]   that you can shoot out of
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:06.880]   the big tubes are like hand
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:07.680]   grenades.
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:09.040]   In fact, they are if you put
[00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:10.240]   shrapnel around them.
[00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:11.120]   I don't want to give
[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:12.160]   Antifa any ideas, but
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:13.720]   they blow people's hands off all
[00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:14.320]   the time.
[00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:15.920]   The mortars go boom and
[00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:17.920]   then shoot out of the tube and
[00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:20.360]   they have a lot of explosive power
[00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:22.720]   to create that huge blue flash,
[00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:25.160]   white flash, red flash that you
[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:25.680]   see.
[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:27.960]   And even in China where they're
[00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:30.400]   not allowed to have firearms and
[00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:32.320]   stuff, when you hear about
[00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:34.600]   the revolts that happen against
[00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:36.680]   the government, people steal
[00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:38.920]   the fireworks out of facilities
[00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:40.800]   and use those as weapons and
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:42.000]   they are bombs.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.720]   And if you watch some of these,
[00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:45.680]   these are not normal firecrackers
[00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:47.520]   or cherry bombs that are going off
[00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:48.040]   M80s.
[00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:51.000]   You can see that they are basically
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.960]   throwing larger fireworks at them
[00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:56.720]   that are very, very dangerous.
[00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:58.480]   You see the phosphorus shooting
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:48:59.480]   out, you name it.
[00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:00.880]   If somebody tries to throw one of
[00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:02.200]   those at you, it's my view,
[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:03.880]   that's an extremely deadly weapon.
[00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:05.320]   And I guarantee you,
[00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:07.800]   if the police see somebody holding
[00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:09.680]   a mortar, lighting it and
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:11.800]   then throwing it, you have no
[00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:13.960]   choice but to take those people
[00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:14.460]   out.
[00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:17.000]   This is just becoming outrageously
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:17.720]   insane.
[00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:20.000]   So those are not M80s like the news
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.120]   said they're throwing at them.
[00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:24.760]   They are mortars that appear to
[00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:27.600]   have had the propulsion piece cut
[00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:30.040]   off on the back and have been
[00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:32.600]   directly wired in with a fuse.
[00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:34.320]   So, because let me tell you,
[00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:36.320]   that's what I do for fun back when
[00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:38.000]   I was a teenager and stuff.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.240]   My dad showed me how to put a rock
[00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:42.640]   on one and then light it, wait till
[00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:44.800]   it got down far enough so that it
[00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:46.880]   didn't go out in the water and
[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:48.640]   then drop it into a pond or
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:51.000]   something and see a couple of fish
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:51.720]   float up.
[00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:52.640]   Back when he was a kid,
[00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:54.000]   they had dynamite at the ranch to
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.120]   blow up stumps and stuff,
[00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:56.520]   the tractors couldn't pull out.
[00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:58.240]   His dad still had a box of dynamite
[00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:00.000]   in the truck, but he also worked in
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:01.400]   highway construction and
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:02.760]   stuff as a part time job.
[00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:04.400]   Back when I was a little kid, so
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:05.880]   he was a highway engineer.
[00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:07.440]   So that's why he had dynamite.
[00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:08.960]   But nowadays you can't trust
[00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:10.400]   Americans with dynamite.
[00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:11.640]   You know, you should never have any
[00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:12.680]   attacks with explosives.
[00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:13.840]   And once they make the explosives
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:14.880]   illegal, then suddenly only
[00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:15.800]   the criminals have them.
[00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:17.240]   But I'm digressing off into what
[00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:18.000]   happened there.
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:19.880]   That's coming up in the third hour.
[00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:22.200]   I've got to reset.
[00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:23.360]   There's so much news here.
[00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:24.400]   I don't even know where to start.
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   We've got a lot of good news,
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:27.720]   a lot of bad news,
[00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:28.600]   a lot of insane news,
[00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:29.880]   a lot of crazy news.
[00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:33.360]   I cannot express to you how big
[00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:36.280]   this is that Trump is getting ready
[00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:39.000]   to start the 9/11 drumbeat and
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.700]   bring out what really happened on
[00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:42.440]   9/11.
[00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:43.880]   That is the thinking behind
[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:45.920]   Tucker Carlson having the guest on,
[00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:47.600]   the whole 9/11 situation,
[00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:49.760]   the families, Mueller ordering that
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:51.640]   the investigation be shut down,
[00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:53.480]   that the FBI not give that to them
[00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:54.600]   in their lawsuit.
[00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:55.400]   That's already on record.
[00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:56.240]   It's been reported on by
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:56.800]   Mainstream News.
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:59.240]   But I've been told that Trump is
[00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:01.800]   beginning to then bring it all out
[00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:03.560]   using this show.
[00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:05.560]   And they want you to know that.
[00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:07.320]   They want Mueller and all you
[00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:09.600]   arrogant SOBs to know that it's all
[00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:10.520]   coming out.
[00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:12.240]   Epstein and how you had him as
[00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:13.960]   a confidential informant for
[00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:15.960]   years while he was loading little
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:17.920]   girls on airplanes to take them to
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:19.840]   be raped by a bunch of perverts on
[00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:22.080]   his island, that's all confirmed.
[00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:22.760]   And Mueller, just like
[00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:23.800]   Whitey Bulger, could kill whoever
[00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:25.000]   he wanted, killed reportedly over
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.200]   100 people, run mafia operations in
[00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:29.240]   Boston, assassinate members of
[00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:31.240]   other mafias that the FBI wanted
[00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:32.040]   taken out.
[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:35.480]   The FBI was operating as a gang in
[00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:36.600]   Boston.
[00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:38.920]   And it wasn't just a few guys that
[00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:41.760]   were involved, that's all confirmed.
[00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:43.720]   And Mueller ran the cover up and
[00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:45.760]   tried to frame the Italian mafia
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:46.280]   for it.
[00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:48.120]   It's unbelievable,
[00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:48.960]   ladies and gentlemen.
[00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:52.760]   And But the sex offender Epstein
[00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:55.480]   only got like a year for
[00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:57.400]   all the stuff he did, 18 months,
[00:51:57.400 --> 00:51:58.920]   served like a year of it.
[00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:00.720]   He served 13 months of 18 months,
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:01.840]   I remember he said 12,
[00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:03.280]   it was 13 months.
[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:04.520]   I mean, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:05.560]   this is the guy with 20 plus
[00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:06.640]   flights with Bill Clinton.
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:08.160]   This is the guy flying to the Sheiks
[00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:09.480]   islands that are known to have
[00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:11.080]   sex slaves, it's been confirmed.
[00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:13.840]   Robert Mueller is a nightmarish
[00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:15.560]   demon of the Clintons and
[00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:17.840]   the Bushes, who used all of that
[00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:20.480]   information that they garnered with
[00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:22.000]   public officials and
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.400]   people going to have sex with 13,
[00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:27.080]   12 year old girls to burn everybody.
[00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:28.360]   And he's a monster, people are
[00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:29.760]   like, well, you better watch out,
[00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:30.680]   Mueller's a criminal.
[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:31.440]   I know he's a criminal.
[00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:34.880]   I know all about how he operates,
[00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:36.280]   man, somebody's got to take
[00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:37.080]   these guys on.
[00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:38.600]   I don't want to hear, well,
[00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:40.040]   you're defiling the FBI.
[00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:41.480]   He's not the FBI,
[00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:43.840]   he's a disgusting nightmare
[00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:44.680]   creature.
[00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:47.240]   And he's going down,
[00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:48.800]   Mueller will never politically
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:50.120]   survive what he's done.
[00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:51.600]   He'll never bring down Trump,
[00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:52.720]   he'll bring nothing down.
[00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:55.000]   He is a loser, but an arrogant
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.840]   creature for decades operating and
[00:52:57.840 --> 00:53:00.800]   getting away with crime after crime,
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:03.560]   after crime, after crime against
[00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:05.880]   children, against women,
[00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:07.560]   against humanity.
[00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:09.200]   And all the innocent people that
[00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:10.440]   Whitey Bulger killed,
[00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:12.280]   just choking to death, young women
[00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:13.920]   for no reason because they heard
[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:15.620]   something, just a lot of really
[00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:17.560]   evil stuff, that's where he comes
[00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:19.880]   from, that's what Mueller's into.
[00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:22.160]   He's a thug, he's a gangster.
[00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:24.720]   But now he's up against history,
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:25.960]   and now he's going to lose.
[00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:28.480]   So that's coming up.
[00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:29.800]   We're going to get into ICE
[00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:31.600]   throwing bricks through the window
[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:33.160]   and then assaulting people and
[00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:34.400]   calling for all of it.
[00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:36.240]   And I've got a lot of good news I'm
[00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:37.840]   going to get to that I mentioned
[00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:38.360]   as well.
[00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:40.280]   We've got Bono warning that
[00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:42.480]   the whole global government's
[00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:44.720]   collapsing, Venezuela further
[00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:46.720]   protest, this country begins
[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:48.200]   running out of water.
[00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:50.320]   Greenpeace activists crashed drone
[00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:52.080]   in the French nuclear plant,
[00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:53.840]   a bunch of vampire killers on
[00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:56.080]   the loose, Satanist women strangle
[00:53:56.080 --> 00:53:57.680]   boyfriend in BDSM sex and
[00:53:57.680 --> 00:53:59.680]   chop him up in devil sacrifice.
[00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:02.520]   To show you the type of folks we're
[00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:05.440]   up against, that's all coming up.
[00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:06.840]   But first off, ladies and
[00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:08.680]   gentlemen, it's the 4th of July
[00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:10.680]   specials we're running right now.
[00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:12.080]   And I want to thank you all that
[00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:13.400]   have been supportive, but
[00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:15.160]   these are great products you need,

[00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:28.200]   products more and more because as

[00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:31.440]   then we're able to buy more at
[00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:32.680]   a lower price.
[00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:34.520]   But then it becomes this catch 22
[00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:35.320]   to sell stuff.
[00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:37.240]   I have to always discount it almost
[00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:38.080]   down to cost.
[00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:39.800]   So these are really some great

[00:56:46.220 --> 00:56:47.620]   filter.
[00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:48.780]   But if you've got a smaller house,
[00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:49.780]   one for the back of the house,
[00:56:49.780 --> 00:56:51.180]   one in the front of your house.

[00:57:58.980 --> 00:58:00.100]   As the years went on and

[01:00:06.060 --> 01:00:08.220]   >> Well, here we are,
[01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:10.460]   July 5th, 2018.
[01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:12.860]   Another epic July 4th has come and
[01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:15.020]   gone, and never has it been more
[01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:17.020]   clear where the stakes are for
[01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:17.820]   humanity.
[01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:19.100]   But I want to make a point.
[01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:20.780]   There's a Churchill quote,
[01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:22.780]   I'm paraphrasing it, that many
[01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:24.500]   people get hit by history.
[01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:26.460]   They get run over in the street by
[01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:28.700]   huge, big, epic developments, and
[01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:30.620]   they kind of dust themselves off
[01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:32.460]   and ignore the point in history
[01:00:32.460 --> 01:00:33.580]   that they're in.
[01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:35.540]   But there are other people that
[01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:36.900]   get hit by destiny and
[01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:38.740]   by history, and they get up and
[01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:40.500]   it changes the course of their
[01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:41.060]   lives and
[01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:43.140]   countless other people's lives.
[01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:44.980]   And so I want people to remember
[01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:47.060]   that the hundreds of millions that
[01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:48.580]   died under communism and
[01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:50.500]   the tens of millions that died
[01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:52.620]   under fascism and other cults and
[01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:54.540]   permutations of governmental
[01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:56.340]   control and societal mental
[01:00:56.340 --> 01:00:58.500]   illness manifest by government,
[01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:00.460]   that we are on the precipice of
[01:01:00.460 --> 01:01:02.140]   a new global revolution,
[01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:04.020]   a new Renaissance.
[01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:05.780]   And we're actually, because of
[01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:07.740]   people's work before us, sitting
[01:01:07.740 --> 01:01:09.420]   on a great brain trust of human
[01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:11.140]   liberty, and that we've got a
[01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:12.980]   chance to fight for freedom when
[01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:14.860]   the odds are actually on our side
[01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:15.940]   if we realize it.
[01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:18.340]   We've got to look back on those
[01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:20.980]   that didn't have a chance to win,
[01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:23.340]   but took action and did what was
[01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:25.820]   right because it was about their
[01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:28.180]   soul and about the spiritual,
[01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:30.900]   cultural, human decision they were
[01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:31.860]   making, and
[01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:33.660]   that's why they were fulfilled.
[01:01:33.660 --> 01:01:35.380]   So again, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:36.580]   I want to thank you all for
[01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:37.340]   your support.
[01:01:37.340 --> 01:01:38.340]   I want to thank you all for
[01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:38.980]   your prayers.
[01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:40.140]   I want to thank you all for
[01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:41.580]   what you've done against the
[01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:43.300]   bullies and the peer pressure over
[01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:45.180]   the years, because if it wasn't for
[01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:46.620]   you, and if it wasn't for
[01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:48.100]   everything you've done,
[01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:49.340]   we wouldn't be here.
[01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:52.260]   Many of those people aren't here
[01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:54.500]   today that stood up for
[01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:56.100]   what was right.
[01:01:56.100 --> 01:01:58.340]   But in their gut, they believed in
[01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:00.500]   you and they believed in me, and
[01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:02.740]   they believed that we could build
[01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:03.940]   a better future.
[01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:05.700]   They had goodwill towards people.
[01:02:05.700 --> 01:02:07.100]   They didn't want to use the fact
[01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:08.500]   that they had more knowledge than
[01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:09.740]   the average person to control
[01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:10.340]   that person.
[01:02:10.340 --> 01:02:12.500]   They didn't want to use the fact
[01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:14.100]   that they understood how the game
[01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:15.740]   was played to then set up a little
[01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:17.420]   secret cabal and feed on people.
[01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:19.420]   They had the true vision of human
[01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:21.620]   empowerment and the true mastery to
[01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:22.820]   empower others and
[01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:24.620]   bring them to the next level.
[01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:28.220]   They were Christ-like in their duty,
[01:02:28.220 --> 01:02:30.460]   in their focus, in their sacrifice,
[01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:31.820]   in their commitment.
[01:02:31.820 --> 01:02:33.820]   And so that's why it's obnoxious.
[01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:35.380]   It's flagrant.
[01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:36.780]   It's arrogant.
[01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:38.180]   It's narcissistic.
[01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:40.260]   It's satanic to make the victories
[01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:41.940]   we're having about Trump or
[01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:43.860]   about Infowars or about anybody
[01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:44.380]   else.
[01:02:44.380 --> 01:02:46.420]   It's about you and your awakening
[01:02:46.420 --> 01:02:48.380]   and the decisions you've made.
[01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:50.340]   So I just want to tell you as we've
[01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:52.180]   passed through this July 4th,
[01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:54.260]   2018, as the globalists launched
[01:02:54.260 --> 01:02:56.180]   their riots and their attacks and
[01:02:56.180 --> 01:02:58.180]   their lies and their moralizing,
[01:02:58.180 --> 01:03:00.220]   that have good cheer, my friends,
[01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:02.180]   because we're living in a time and
[01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:04.180]   age when the devil knows the time
[01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:06.180]   is short, so he sends the beast
[01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:07.020]   with wrath.
[01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:08.220]   And there are whole world
[01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:09.460]   government systems here,
[01:03:09.460 --> 01:03:10.500]   the mark of the beast.
[01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:11.980]   It's going to be a lot of trials,
[01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:13.060]   a lot of tribulations.
[01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:15.060]   But we know the truth, and
[01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:16.660]   we know who wins, and
[01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:18.700]   we know where this all goes.
[01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:21.860]   And so that's a very positive fact
[01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:23.420]   to understand.
[01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:27.220]   All that matters is what you stand
[01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:27.860]   for.
[01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:30.580]   [SOUND] All that matters is not
[01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:33.140]   being a coward and not feeding on
[01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:34.940]   people that aren't as smart as you.
[01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:36.700]   And the minute you realize that,
[01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:38.300]   you're in God's arms forever.
[01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:39.620]   And these Satanists and
[01:03:39.620 --> 01:03:40.820]   these Crowleyites and
[01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:42.700]   these Democrats and these Chi-Coms
[01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:44.420]   and all these control freaks who
[01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:45.780]   want to control reality,
[01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:47.460]   who want to try to become a God,
[01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:48.900]   because they merge with AI
[01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:50.940]   technology, they don't understand,
[01:03:50.940 --> 01:03:52.580]   they already had a connection to
[01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:52.940]   God.
[01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:54.540]   They were already an expression of
[01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:56.300]   God's consciousness in the universe,
[01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:57.860]   and there was no need to ever even
[01:03:57.860 --> 01:03:58.380]   do that.
[01:03:58.380 --> 01:04:00.540]   But that's why we have free will.
[01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:02.900]   Some people will fall to the lower
[01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:03.860]   dimension.
[01:04:03.860 --> 01:04:05.700]   Some people will rise and
[01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:08.020]   ascend towards a communion and
[01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:10.260]   a reunification with Christ.
[01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:12.100]   And that's the big choice, and
[01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:13.940]   that's why I know you've made
[01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:15.140]   the right choice.
[01:04:15.140 --> 01:04:16.460]   You're not going to find Christ in
[01:04:16.460 --> 01:04:17.580]   these whorehouse churches.
[01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:19.620]   That's where the literal globalists
[01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:21.340]   run the operation via the World
[01:04:21.340 --> 01:04:22.620]   Council of Churches.
[01:04:22.620 --> 01:04:24.500]   But you're going to find the real
[01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:26.700]   Christ in your heart, seeking after
[01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:28.420]   God and saying, I want to be
[01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:30.500]   a good person, I want to be just,
[01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:31.940]   I want to be honorable,
[01:04:31.940 --> 01:04:33.660]   I'm going to tell the truth.
[01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:35.500]   So again, are those of us here when
[01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:37.300]   we're seeing this great awakening
[01:04:37.300 --> 01:04:38.020]   the heroes?
[01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:39.460]   No, the heroes are those in
[01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:41.340]   Communist China and North Korea and
[01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:43.060]   old Soviet Russia and countless
[01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:44.740]   other places like Cuba that were
[01:04:44.740 --> 01:04:46.460]   tortured and murdered and killed
[01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:48.100]   and watched their children go to
[01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:49.900]   prison because they didn't deny God
[01:04:49.900 --> 01:04:50.740]   and the truth.
[01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:52.180]   And to them on this July 4th,
[01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:53.380]   I want to thank you all and
[01:04:53.380 --> 01:04:55.020]   thank you for 1776 worldwide.

[01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:03.100]   of fun with my goofier moments here.
[01:07:03.100 --> 01:07:04.380]   But when I do get like that,
[01:07:04.380 --> 01:07:05.980]   I'm alive, I'm not backing down.
[01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:07.740]   I'm aware of what you're doing, and

[01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:14.700]   Let's start this hour with some
[01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:15.620]   good news.
[01:07:15.620 --> 01:07:17.580]   The Democrats, the globalists, in
[01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:19.060]   every one of their internal
[01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:20.620]   publications are running up
[01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:21.580]   the white flag,
[01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:23.500]   admitting that they're losing.
[01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:25.540]   And they're very upset that
[01:07:25.540 --> 01:07:28.060]   the economy and positive thinking
[01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:30.580]   and belief in the family is starting
[01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:33.140]   to have a little bit of a resurgence.
[01:07:33.140 --> 01:07:35.060]   Because they know like fire,
[01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:36.340]   that will spread,
[01:07:36.340 --> 01:07:38.300]   burning down their tyranny.
[01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:40.140]   It will bring satisfaction,
[01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:41.740]   it will bring normalcy,
[01:07:41.740 --> 01:07:43.620]   it will bring productivity,
[01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:45.300]   it will bring happiness.
[01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:46.700]   The globalists and
[01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:49.420]   their corporate disease is designed
[01:07:49.420 --> 01:07:51.940]   mental illness to destabilize and
[01:07:51.940 --> 01:07:53.340]   control society.
[01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:54.900]   Here's just one of the clips.
[01:07:54.900 --> 01:07:55.940]   Chuck Todd,
[01:07:55.940 --> 01:07:58.380]   the Obama Clinton operative,
[01:07:58.380 --> 01:08:00.940]   admits President Trump winning
[01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:02.620]   Democrats reeling.
[01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:03.780]   Here it is.
[01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:05.340]   >> Announced retirement of Supreme
[01:08:05.340 --> 01:08:07.060]   Court Justice Anthony Kennedy this

[01:08:08.540 --> 01:08:09.380]   reality clear.
[01:08:09.380 --> 01:08:11.460]   Despite his overall unpopularity,
[01:08:11.460 --> 01:08:13.340]   President Trump is winning, and
[01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:15.500]   the Democrats right now are reeling.
[01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:16.860]   The Supreme Court, Mr.
[01:08:16.860 --> 01:08:18.580]   Trump is about to shape the court
[01:08:18.580 --> 01:08:20.180]   for a generation by choosing a
[01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:21.420]   possible tie breaking
[01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:22.820]   conservative justice.
[01:08:22.820 --> 01:08:24.300]   And he's already filled the lower
[01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:25.300]   courts with like minded
[01:08:25.300 --> 01:08:26.060]   conservatives.
[01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:27.820]   How about the Republican Party?
[01:08:27.820 --> 01:08:29.460]   The President's approval rating
[01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:31.220]   among Republicans is around 90%.
[01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:32.700]   Elected Republicans fear
[01:08:32.700 --> 01:08:34.020]   criticizing him, and
[01:08:34.020 --> 01:08:35.700]   the party has become a cult of
[01:08:35.700 --> 01:08:36.980]   personality, his.
[01:08:36.980 --> 01:08:38.820]   How about fake news?
[01:08:38.820 --> 01:08:40.660]   Mr. Trump has turned that phrase,
[01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:42.260]   which initially referred to
[01:08:42.260 --> 01:08:44.300]   the phony Russian generated stories
[01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:46.300]   designed to support his campaign in
[01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:48.340]   2016, into an applause line now to
[01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:50.180]   discredit responsible reporting
[01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:51.700]   showcasing his misdeeds.
[01:08:51.700 --> 01:08:53.140]   How about credibility?
[01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:54.740]   If reporters faithfully fact check
[01:08:54.740 --> 01:08:55.940]   the President's serial
[01:08:55.940 --> 01:08:56.820]   misstatements,
[01:08:56.820 --> 01:08:58.660]   they risk being considered biased.
[01:08:58.660 --> 01:08:59.220]   If they don't,
[01:08:59.220 --> 01:09:00.580]   the misstatements gain traction.
[01:09:00.580 --> 01:09:01.540]   >> Yeah, but there's just too
[01:09:01.540 --> 01:09:02.180]   many lies.
[01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:03.980]   I mean, did you catch how they'll
[01:09:03.980 --> 01:09:05.740]   tell the truth but insert a lie?
[01:09:05.740 --> 01:09:07.580]   Despite Trump's overall
[01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:10.220]   unfavorability, even in their fake
[01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:12.780]   Gallup polls and others that add 15
[01:09:12.780 --> 01:09:15.260]   points more of Democrats, he's at
[01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:15.860]   50%.
[01:09:15.860 --> 01:09:18.380]   So that's not the majority being
[01:09:18.380 --> 01:09:19.340]   negative.
[01:09:19.340 --> 01:09:21.660]   And they're also calling people and
[01:09:21.660 --> 01:09:23.940]   sampling mainly Democrat areas on
[01:09:23.940 --> 01:09:26.180]   record to create that illusion.
[01:09:26.180 --> 01:09:28.140]   With all these little followers out
[01:09:28.140 --> 01:09:29.300]   there that are mad.
[01:09:29.300 --> 01:09:30.820]   And then he goes on to say,
[01:09:30.820 --> 01:09:32.860]   despite fake news initially being
[01:09:32.860 --> 01:09:34.780]   to expose Russian bots, well,
[01:09:34.780 --> 01:09:36.900]   it turns out 80% of those Russian
[01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:38.940]   bots, just some company that got
[01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:41.060]   hired in Russia were for Hillary.
[01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:42.260]   And again, it goes on and
[01:09:42.260 --> 01:09:43.380]   on and on and on and on.
[01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:45.500]   So he tells the truth overall that
[01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:47.660]   Trump's winning but inserts lies
[01:09:47.660 --> 01:09:49.860]   after lie, after lie, after lie.
[01:09:49.860 --> 01:09:51.380]   The truth is the economy's coming
[01:09:51.380 --> 01:09:51.780]   back.
[01:09:51.780 --> 01:09:53.260]   The truth is Trump's hitting on all
[01:09:53.260 --> 01:09:53.860]   cylinders.
[01:09:53.860 --> 01:09:55.380]   The truth is you've been caught
[01:09:55.380 --> 01:09:56.940]   with your Russiagate thing being
[01:09:56.940 --> 01:09:57.660]   a whole hoax.
[01:09:57.660 --> 01:09:59.820]   I saw Bill Clinton on one of those
[01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:01.980]   Comedy Central shows last week.
[01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:03.060]   I meant to play it,
[01:10:03.060 --> 01:10:04.700]   they pulled the headline.
[01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:06.620]   It was, I think Trevor Noah's
[01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:07.740]   the guy's name.
[01:10:07.740 --> 01:10:09.580]   And he's on there going,
[01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:10.300]   I'll tell you,
[01:10:10.300 --> 01:10:11.860]   I think Sarah Huckabee Sanders was
[01:10:11.860 --> 01:10:12.500]   really nice.
[01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:14.260]   She paid for a meal, she left when
[01:10:14.260 --> 01:10:15.820]   she was told to, that's a good
[01:10:15.820 --> 01:10:17.500]   thing, that makes him sound like
[01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:18.780]   a Southern gentleman.
[01:10:18.780 --> 01:10:19.780]   Because that bile,
[01:10:19.780 --> 01:10:22.020]   that poison's going to come back.
[01:10:22.020 --> 01:10:23.620]   That Trump's vomiting saying all
[01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:24.940]   Mexicans are criminals and
[01:10:24.940 --> 01:10:26.100]   scum and he hates them.
[01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:27.540]   When you say all the Mexicans are
[01:10:27.540 --> 01:10:28.940]   scum and criminals and you hate
[01:10:28.940 --> 01:10:30.500]   them, some of that's going to come
[01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:31.500]   back on your people.
[01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:32.820]   So he caused that.
[01:10:32.820 --> 01:10:35.340]   >> Trump never said Mexicans are
[01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:37.100]   scum or all criminals are bad.
[01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:38.820]   Just total lie, but- >> Let me just
[01:10:38.820 --> 01:10:39.980]   say I'm a gentleman,
[01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:41.700]   Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
[01:10:41.700 --> 01:10:42.700]   I don't condemn kicking her out
[01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:43.620]   of the restaurant, by the way.
[01:10:43.620 --> 01:10:45.940]   I'm just saying she politely even
[01:10:45.940 --> 01:10:48.060]   paid for a meal and she left.
[01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:48.580]   That's good.
[01:10:48.580 --> 01:10:50.060]   Get your ass out of here.
[01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:51.780]   [LAUGH] But the point is,
[01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:53.700]   you deserve it because of the
[01:10:53.700 --> 01:10:55.780]   poison that Trump spewed out.
[01:10:55.780 --> 01:10:57.140]   Some of that poison is going to
[01:10:57.140 --> 01:10:57.860]   come back up.
[01:10:57.860 --> 01:10:58.500]   That's the quote.
[01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:01.300]   Some of that poison is going to
[01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:02.180]   come back up on you.
[01:11:02.180 --> 01:11:04.180]   See, but Trump didn't say that.
[01:11:04.180 --> 01:11:05.940]   But see, by making it sound like
[01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:07.380]   he's being congenial and
[01:11:07.380 --> 01:11:08.420]   a nice headline.
[01:11:08.420 --> 01:11:10.500]   Look, I don't like what
[01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:11.340]   happened to her.
[01:11:11.340 --> 01:11:13.140]   Well, actually she did deserve it.
[01:11:13.140 --> 01:11:15.660]   [LAUGH] But that's how I do it.
[01:11:15.660 --> 01:11:16.780]   That's how I run the things
[01:11:16.780 --> 01:11:17.340]   around here.
[01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:18.580]   It's really nice to be able to lie
[01:11:18.580 --> 01:11:19.660]   to people like that.
[01:11:19.660 --> 01:11:20.860]   Let's go back to old Toddy.
[01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:21.380]   Here he is.
[01:11:21.380 --> 01:11:23.860]   >> And either way, Mr. Trump wins.
[01:11:23.860 --> 01:11:25.380]   The Mueller investigation,
[01:11:25.380 --> 01:11:27.060]   the president has succeeded in
[01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:28.500]   convincing millions that
[01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:30.180]   the investigation is biased,
[01:11:30.180 --> 01:11:32.460]   despite trafficking only in innuendo.
[01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:33.820]   >> Trafficking, back it up 20
[01:11:33.820 --> 01:11:34.500]   seconds.
[01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:36.420]   Trafficking only in innuendo,
[01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:38.180]   because Chuck Todd reading off
[01:11:38.180 --> 01:11:39.700]   a teleprompter said so.
[01:11:39.700 --> 01:11:41.380]   They've caught him in the stroke
[01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:42.780]   emails, the page emails,
[01:11:42.780 --> 01:11:44.300]   the McCabe emails.
[01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:45.660]   We got to keep him from getting in.
[01:11:45.660 --> 01:11:46.460]   We're going to stop him.
[01:11:46.460 --> 01:11:47.420]   We're going to fix it.
[01:11:47.420 --> 01:11:48.940]   Insurance policies, millions of
[01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:50.580]   dollars for the fake fusion GPS.
[01:11:50.580 --> 01:11:51.980]   Mueller breaking all the rules.
[01:11:51.980 --> 01:11:53.060]   The thing going on and on.
[01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:54.140]   Rosenstein controlling
[01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:54.860]   the whole deal.
[01:11:56.300 --> 01:11:58.140]   Comey and Strzok covering up for
[01:11:58.140 --> 01:11:59.820]   Hillary on the server gate and
[01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:01.380]   Benghazi and Russia gate.
[01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:04.860]   But meanwhile, Chuck Todd says,
[01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:06.700]   he's succeeded.
[01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:09.100]   In despite the fact there's no
[01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:11.860]   evidence that anybody colluded to
[01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:14.020]   frame him that we did.
[01:12:14.020 --> 01:12:16.060]   No, you've been caught red handed,
[01:12:16.060 --> 01:12:16.740]   continue.
[01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:19.220]   >> Either way, Mr. Trump wins.
[01:12:19.220 --> 01:12:20.660]   The Mueller investigation,
[01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:22.140]   the president has succeeded in
[01:12:22.140 --> 01:12:23.460]   convincing millions that
[01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:25.340]   the investigation is biased despite
[01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:27.060]   trafficking only in innuendo and
[01:12:27.060 --> 01:12:28.420]   not providing evidence.
[01:12:28.420 --> 01:12:29.340]   Then there's the economy.
[01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:30.120]   It is doing well, but
[01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:31.220]   it was doing well before he took
[01:12:31.220 --> 01:12:31.740]   office.
[01:12:31.740 --> 01:12:32.860]   >> Pause.
[01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:34.180]   No, it was slowing before and
[01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:35.500]   now we've got thousands of new
[01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:36.580]   factories coming in and
[01:12:36.580 --> 01:12:38.060]   exuberance is up and they said it
[01:12:38.060 --> 01:12:39.340]   would never be above 3%.
[01:12:39.340 --> 01:12:40.860]   And it's basically about to be
[01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:42.860]   announced at 4%, on and on and on.
[01:12:42.860 --> 01:12:44.500]   So see, that was all Obama did
[01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:46.420]   that who said he'd never get above
[01:12:46.420 --> 01:12:46.920]   3%.
[01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:48.140]   What's he have a magic wand?
[01:12:48.140 --> 01:12:50.820]   Yeah, there's a magic wand hoping
[01:12:50.820 --> 01:12:51.780]   we're stupid,
[01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:53.260]   hoping we're gullible.
[01:12:53.260 --> 01:12:54.860]   >> It was doing well before he took
[01:12:54.860 --> 01:12:56.700]   office, yet with unemployment down
[01:12:56.700 --> 01:12:57.980]   and jobs being created,
[01:12:57.980 --> 01:12:59.660]   President Trump is getting this
[01:12:59.660 --> 01:13:00.220]   credit.
[01:13:00.220 --> 01:13:01.220]   Still, much of Mr.
[01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:03.140]   Trump's success is superficial.
[01:13:03.140 --> 01:13:04.340]   While he's more popular among
[01:13:04.340 --> 01:13:05.660]   Republicans, the party overall
[01:13:05.660 --> 01:13:06.300]   is shrinking.
[01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:07.980]   His trade war, North Korea, or
[01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:09.700]   the Mueller investigation, all
[01:13:09.700 --> 01:13:11.100]   could turn against him and
[01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:12.900]   frankly could turn against him now
[01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:14.100]   like North Korea has.
[01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:15.780]   >> And they're cheerleading that
[01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:17.740]   North Korea hasn't done everything
[01:13:17.740 --> 01:13:19.020]   it said it would do, but
[01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:20.340]   they never even agreed on
[01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:21.900]   the new timetable.
[01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:23.620]   And so Pompeo's rushing out there.
[01:13:23.620 --> 01:13:24.820]   We're trying to take North Korea
[01:13:24.820 --> 01:13:25.780]   away from China.
[01:13:25.780 --> 01:13:27.220]   They're putting pressure on them.
[01:13:27.220 --> 01:13:28.420]   This is a real tug of war to get
[01:13:28.420 --> 01:13:29.980]   them to come out of the dark.
[01:13:29.980 --> 01:13:31.180]   China's been keeping them in that
[01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:31.780]   bad position.
[01:13:31.780 --> 01:13:32.900]   That's coming up later.
[01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:33.660]   I'm going to break that down.
[01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:36.060]   But Trump's trying to go get peace.
[01:13:36.060 --> 01:13:37.740]   Trump's trying to fix things,
[01:13:37.740 --> 01:13:39.420]   something you guys never did.
[01:13:39.420 --> 01:13:41.260]   And then Chuck Todd sits up there
[01:13:41.260 --> 01:13:42.860]   bad mouthing everything.
[01:13:42.860 --> 01:13:44.420]   It's incredible.
[01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:45.300]   Meanwhile, no,
[01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:47.060]   the Republican Party's growing.
[01:13:47.060 --> 01:13:47.780]   It's populist.
[01:13:47.780 --> 01:13:48.740]   We're taking it over.
[01:13:48.740 --> 01:13:50.420]   It's getting more gubernatorial
[01:13:50.420 --> 01:13:51.880]   seats, more state house seats.
[01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:53.380]   More federal seats.
[01:13:53.380 --> 01:13:56.300]   The Democratic Party is
[01:13:56.300 --> 01:14:00.620]   a bizarro elitist coastal party.
[01:14:00.620 --> 01:14:03.420]   That its only hope is to bring in
[01:14:03.420 --> 01:14:06.620]   dumbed down third world populations
[01:14:06.620 --> 01:14:09.020]   that are on their payroll.
[01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:10.700]   So again, that's just Chuck Todd
[01:14:10.700 --> 01:14:11.980]   trying to hold the line,
[01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:14.180]   hold the forces during collapse.
[01:14:14.180 --> 01:14:15.620]   Make everybody think that they've
[01:14:15.620 --> 01:14:16.860]   got a shot from coming back from
[01:14:16.860 --> 01:14:18.060]   the dead and betting against
[01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:18.820]   the US economy.
[01:14:18.820 --> 01:14:19.660]   Saying it could turn,
[01:14:19.660 --> 01:14:20.620]   it could turn any moment.
[01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:21.460]   It's superficial.
[01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:22.720]   America isn't strong.
[01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:23.720]   By the way, I'm Chuck Todd.
[01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:24.680]   I love America.
[01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:25.600]   Remember CNN?
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:26.880]   We don't hate America.
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:27.600]   We love America.
[01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:28.480]   We don't hate Americans.
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:29.320]   We love Americans.
[01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:31.280]   Yeah, right.
[01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:34.760]   Bono warns that existence of UN,
[01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:36.960]   EU, and NATO are threatened.
[01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:38.960]   Well, the UN's a big criminal body
[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:40.920]   with a horrible, wicked record.
[01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:42.160]   It's civil human rights
[01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:43.660]   commissions run by a bunch of
[01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:45.360]   dictators and mass murderers.
[01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:46.560]   It's literally a joke.
[01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:48.320]   The EU was created after a Nazi
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:50.440]   plan, has an unelected bureaucracy
[01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:51.320]   that runs it.
[01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:52.740]   And NATO's completely out of
[01:14:52.740 --> 01:14:53.980]   control, drug dealing,
[01:14:53.980 --> 01:14:55.220]   child sex trafficking.
[01:14:55.220 --> 01:14:56.920]   And he says they're all threatened
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:58.680]   and Bono's a little UN guy who goes
[01:14:58.680 --> 01:14:59.780]   out and says save it.
[01:14:59.780 --> 01:15:02.000]   Who gives less than 1% of the money
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:03.920]   he raises billions of dollars,
[01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:05.500]   $3 billion he's raised.
[01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:10.620]   For African aid, he keeps 99%.
[01:15:10.620 --> 01:15:12.900]   Talk about a monster pig creature.
[01:15:12.900 --> 01:15:15.420]   Meanwhile, Venezuela further
[01:15:15.420 --> 01:15:17.460]   protest as country begins running
[01:15:17.460 --> 01:15:18.660]   out of water.
[01:15:18.660 --> 01:15:19.940]   I'm going to get more into that.
[01:15:19.940 --> 01:15:21.760]   Brian Ross leaving ABC after lying
[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:22.960]   about General Flynn and
[01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:24.560]   saying he was a Russian agent.

[01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:51.800]   Michael Moore has raised
[01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:52.680]   the battle cry.
[01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:54.560]   You've got all these people
[01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:56.880]   getting arrested for going out and
[01:21:56.880 --> 01:21:59.160]   saying kill Rand Paul, murder his
[01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:01.340]   children, murder his wife, rub
[01:22:01.340 --> 01:22:03.680]   their intestines all over the walls
[01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:05.080]   and type killing.
[01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:06.320]   That's all coming up in this
[01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:07.840]   segment, we're breaking it down.
[01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:09.480]   But I thought we'd kick it off
[01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:10.800]   first with a reminder of
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:12.720]   Mad Maxine in her latest speech.
[01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:14.360]   Says we are sick and tired of
[01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:16.440]   Trump, he's been there too long,
[01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:17.320]   impeach 45.
[01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:19.040]   Yeah, because you didn't like
[01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:19.920]   the election.
[01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:21.960]   You don't like the economy coming
[01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:23.960]   back, that your boot on our necks
[01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:26.120]   being removed, and you can see your
[01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:27.760]   corrupt power dwaning and
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:29.480]   your party disappearing.
[01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:33.560]   And that's what's happening.
[01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:36.200]   You can see all of it disappearing,
[01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:37.960]   you can see it running through your
[01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:38.520]   fingers.
[01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:40.000]   So here is Mad Max.
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.920]   >> I am not about to let this
[01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:44.720]   country go by the way of
[01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:45.960]   Donald Trump.
[01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:48.040]   We are sick and tired of him,
[01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:50.200]   he's been there too long.
[01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:52.600]   They dare me to say impeach him,
[01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:54.600]   today I say impeach 45.
[01:22:54.600 --> 01:23:01.080]   [APPLAUSE]
[01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:03.080]   >> Today I say Donald Trump,
[01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:05.560]   this is not your country to do with
[01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:07.480]   whatever you want to do.
[01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:09.120]   This country belongs to all of us.
[01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:10.680]   [APPLAUSE]
[01:23:10.680 --> 01:23:12.520]   >> And the Supreme Court upheld
[01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:14.920]   five countries that don't even have
[01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:17.240]   working airports, where the imams
[01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:18.960]   give them passports, and
[01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:21.360]   then occasional charter flights fly
[01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:23.680]   out, and then unvetted people from
[01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:26.240]   Libya, Somalia, Sudan, where they
[01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:28.240]   sell humans in slave markets.
[01:23:28.240 --> 01:23:31.080]   Where women unattended are kidnapped
[01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:32.720]   in minutes and gang raped.
[01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:35.560]   And then she's calling that bad,
[01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:38.280]   just like Bill Clinton says that
[01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:41.000]   Trump says he hates Mexicans and
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.520]   that Mexicans are criminals.
[01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:45.320]   Now he said we have an open border
[01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:47.080]   with a lot of criminals pouring
[01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:48.720]   across back and forth, it's
[01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:49.440]   dangerous.
[01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:51.560]   So again, they just regurgitate
[01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:53.600]   that lie over and over again.
[01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:55.600]   Let's go ahead and
[01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:57.160]   go to the Scott Pruitt becomes
[01:23:57.160 --> 01:23:59.000]   latest Trump official to be harassed
[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.600]   at a restaurant with the fake,
[01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:02.320]   sanctimonious, angry woman,
[01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:04.120]   with her kid in his face like he's
[01:24:04.120 --> 01:24:05.320]   done something bad.
[01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:07.480]   Then we've got abolish ICE vandals
[01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:09.520]   throw brick through window of GOP
[01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:11.600]   office leave graffiti message.
[01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:13.240]   Here is the latest video.
[01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:15.200]   >> We deserve to have somebody in
[01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:17.280]   the UK who actually does protect
[01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:19.360]   our environment, somebody who
[01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:21.360]   believes in climate change and
[01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:22.880]   takes it seriously for
[01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:24.560]   the benefit of all of us,
[01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:26.320]   including our children.
[01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:28.400]   So I would urge you to resign before
[01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:30.160]   your scandals push you out.
[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:33.040]   [LAUGH] >> So there you go.
[01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:36.720]   Again, America is having its carbon
[01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:38.320]   cut off to bankrupt as China has no
[01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:39.880]   carbon restrictions either this
[01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:40.800]   India or Mexico.
[01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:42.120]   This is an admitted plan to
[01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:43.640]   bankrupt us and pay Al Gore,
[01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:45.640]   the Rothschilds and Soros trillions
[01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:47.360]   of dollars if they ever got their
[01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:49.120]   carbon tax but that's going up in
[01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:50.520]   flame as well.
[01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:52.720]   There's a Nebraska Republican Party
[01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:54.560]   had the old brick thrown through
[01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:56.120]   abolish ICE and that's the
[01:24:56.120 --> 01:24:57.680]   Democrats big mantra now.
[01:24:57.680 --> 01:24:58.440]   Meanwhile,
[01:24:58.440 --> 01:25:00.600]   we have Jennifer Rubin says Sarah
[01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:02.680]   Sanders needs a life sentence of
[01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:04.480]   being made uncomfortable.
[01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:06.200]   Well, you know what's going to
[01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:07.640]   happen in major studies,
[01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:09.600]   it varies from country to country,
[01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:11.440]   but it's normally six times more
[01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:13.320]   likely to steal, nine times more
[01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:15.080]   likely not to give to charity.
[01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:16.720]   Just type in liberals are more
[01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:18.600]   mentally ill, liberals are more
[01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:20.840]   psychotic, liberals are less likely
[01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:22.800]   to give to charity, liberals are
[01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:24.920]   less likely to keep a job, liberals
[01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:26.480]   are more likely to steal,
[01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:28.400]   there are studies in Canada,
[01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:30.680]   Australia, corporations all know
[01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:32.960]   this, their virtues signaling snot
[01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:35.000]   nose control freaks who live to
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:36.920]   rule everyone else and get in
[01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:38.840]   everyone else's business.
[01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:39.960]   That's what they do.
[01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:42.280]   And most of your psychologists in
[01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:44.280]   this country now are Democrat
[01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:46.320]   priesthood who just replaced
[01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:47.320]   confession.
[01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:49.080]   And all they do is work around
[01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:51.160]   the clock to break up families and
[01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:53.520]   destroy this country in many cases.
[01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:55.040]   It's unbelievable.
[01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:56.720]   It's not in all cases, but
[01:25:56.720 --> 01:25:58.480]   that's what's going on and
[01:25:58.480 --> 01:25:59.920]   it's being exposed.
[01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:01.760]   People are figuring out that there
[01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:03.240]   is a cult of control freaks.
[01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:04.320]   I've done a survey and
[01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:05.080]   looked at it.
[01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:06.680]   And you know what the most popular,
[01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:08.120]   they got TV shows about it now.
[01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:09.640]   The most popular thing with
[01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:11.160]   the average Democrat now is
[01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:12.320]   Alistair Crowley.
[01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:14.400]   And you look at the WikiLeaks and
[01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:16.160]   you look at the Podestas and
[01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:17.920]   you look at Ravomovich and
[01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:19.360]   all these people is,
[01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:21.120]   they are into the occult.
[01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:23.240]   They are little magic thinking
[01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:24.880]   Harry Potter fans and
[01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:27.640]   they graduate to Alistair Crowley.
[01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:30.160]   And they are falling apart.
[01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:31.320]   They are losers.
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:32.960]   They are failures looking for
[01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:34.720]   power instead of just being good
[01:26:34.720 --> 01:26:36.440]   and realizing God's there and
[01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:37.600]   that is the power and
[01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:39.480]   that you were already ascended if
[01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:40.320]   you love God.
[01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:42.240]   But instead they always die in
[01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:44.240]   a big pile of their own feces and
[01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:46.560]   total failure like Alistair Crowley
[01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:48.840]   and other delusional fruit bowl.
[01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:50.320]   So let's continue with
[01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:52.240]   Jennifer Rubin, here it is.
[01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:53.840]   >> What's most successful is
[01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:55.440]   getting a million people on
[01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:56.880]   the street to protest.
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:26:57.760]   >> Yeah, pause again,
[01:26:57.760 --> 01:26:58.640]   I'll back that up.
[01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:00.280]   Notice that's the new talking
[01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:01.520]   point from Bill Maher,
[01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:02.680]   from Michael Moore.
[01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:04.680]   Million people surround, surround,
[01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:06.080]   surround, surround, and
[01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:07.760]   then have the provocateurs start
[01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:09.440]   the fires, start the uprising,
[01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:10.720]   start the this and that.
[01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:12.080]   Try to get the black community out
[01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:13.200]   to burn everything down.
[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:14.200]   That's their plan.
[01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:15.560]   The left in their own documents
[01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:16.440]   say we don't do it.
[01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:18.040]   We wear masks, the white people,
[01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:19.560]   the professors, they go out and
[01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:21.200]   burn some stuff, get it started,
[01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:22.840]   hope they can get black folks too.
[01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:24.280]   That's in the documents that are up
[01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:25.920]   on Infowars.com, let's continue.
[01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:27.640]   >> But what's most successful is
[01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:29.140]   getting a million people on
[01:27:29.140 --> 01:27:30.420]   the street to protest.
[01:27:30.420 --> 01:27:32.440]   >> Yeah. >> So let's redirect all of
[01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:34.080]   that good pent up energy to
[01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:36.520]   something that makes a difference.
[01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:38.400]   Let's get a million people to go to
[01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:40.180]   Maine or a million people to go to
[01:27:40.180 --> 01:27:42.080]   Alaska and start putting pressure
[01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:43.080]   on the senators.
[01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:45.120]   >> Yeah. >> So it's perfectly civil
[01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:45.920]   to do that.
[01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:47.680]   No one's telling them to be violent
[01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:48.440]   protesters.
[01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:50.040]   But we're not going to let these
[01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:51.920]   people live through life unscathed.
[01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:54.080]   Sarah Huckabee has no right to live
[01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:55.760]   a life of no fuss, no muss,
[01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:57.440]   after lying to the press,
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:27:59.760]   after inciting against the press.
[01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:00.960]   These people should be made
[01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:01.760]   uncomfortable.
[01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:03.360]   And I think that's a life sentence,
[01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:03.880]   frankly.

[01:34:41.460 --> 01:34:42.380]   break through our kind of
[01:34:42.380 --> 01:34:43.660]   private idea that the kids belong
[01:34:43.660 --> 01:34:44.980]   to their parents, or kids belong to
[01:34:44.980 --> 01:34:46.280]   their families and recognize the
[01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:47.660]   kids belong to whole communities.
[01:34:47.660 --> 01:34:51.220]   >> I have decided we really need
[01:34:51.220 --> 01:34:54.260]   camps for adults.
[01:34:54.260 --> 01:34:57.100]   And we need the kind of camps that
[01:34:57.100 --> 01:34:59.900]   you all run, I mean, really.
[01:34:59.900 --> 01:35:01.540]   >> All persons of Japanese descent
[01:35:01.540 --> 01:35:03.340]   were required to register.
[01:35:03.340 --> 01:35:04.860]   Now they were taken to racetracks
[01:35:04.860 --> 01:35:06.220]   and fairgrounds where the army
[01:35:06.220 --> 01:35:07.260]   almost overnight had
[01:35:07.260 --> 01:35:08.460]   built assembly centers.
[01:35:08.460 --> 01:35:09.020]   >> Come on.
[01:35:09.020 --> 01:35:10.340]   >> I'm a soviet citizen,
[01:35:10.340 --> 01:35:12.340]   I refuse to recognize you guys.
[01:35:12.340 --> 01:35:13.500]   >> What kind of a situation in
[01:35:13.500 --> 01:35:15.020]   the US would you see that happening?
[01:35:15.020 --> 01:35:16.020]   >> I mean, we've got a lot
[01:35:16.020 --> 01:35:17.140]   of constitutionless and
[01:35:17.140 --> 01:35:18.620]   a lot of people that stockpile
[01:35:18.620 --> 01:35:19.180]   weapons.
[01:35:19.180 --> 01:35:20.660]   >> Plus you have a lot of people
[01:35:20.660 --> 01:35:22.460]   that are coming out of the military
[01:35:22.460 --> 01:35:23.820]   that have the ability and
[01:35:23.820 --> 01:35:25.540]   the knowledge to build IEDs and
[01:35:25.540 --> 01:35:27.020]   to defeat law enforcement
[01:35:27.020 --> 01:35:27.860]   techniques.
[01:35:27.860 --> 01:35:30.220]   >> These people are radicalized and
[01:35:30.220 --> 01:35:32.300]   they don't support the United
[01:35:32.300 --> 01:35:34.540]   States and they're disloyal to
[01:35:34.540 --> 01:35:36.060]   the United States.
[01:35:36.060 --> 01:35:37.100]   It's our right and
[01:35:37.100 --> 01:35:38.940]   our obligation to segregate them
[01:35:38.940 --> 01:35:40.580]   from the normal community.
[01:35:40.580 --> 01:35:47.020]   [MUSIC]
[01:35:47.020 --> 01:35:48.620]   >> It's what we're doing here and
[01:35:48.620 --> 01:35:49.820]   let's not kid about it.
[01:35:49.820 --> 01:35:51.460]   We're building a domestic army
[01:35:51.460 --> 01:35:53.180]   because the government is afraid
[01:35:53.180 --> 01:35:54.340]   of its own citizens.
[01:35:54.340 --> 01:35:55.900]   >> Put your gun down, really?

[01:36:04.780 --> 01:36:05.660]   >> Are you some kind of
[01:36:05.660 --> 01:36:06.820]   a constitutionalist?

[01:36:14.060 --> 01:36:16.580]   not, they're nothing more than
[01:36:16.580 --> 01:36:18.420]   domestic terrorists.
[01:36:18.420 --> 01:36:19.820]   >> If you are receiving this

[01:37:07.460 --> 01:37:10.100]   on the air to talk about all
[01:37:10.100 --> 01:37:13.380]   the huge news that's breaking,
[01:37:13.380 --> 01:37:15.940]   all the big developments.
[01:37:15.940 --> 01:37:17.620]   What do you make of what I covered
[01:37:17.620 --> 01:37:19.460]   first hour that Trump is preparing
[01:37:19.460 --> 01:37:21.580]   to start releasing 9/11 information
[01:37:21.580 --> 01:37:22.820]   about the stand down?
[01:37:22.820 --> 01:37:24.460]   About Robert Mueller and
[01:37:24.460 --> 01:37:26.140]   the cover up, all of it.
[01:37:26.140 --> 01:37:28.220]   That's an exclusive,
[01:37:28.220 --> 01:37:30.780]   infowars.com from high level
[01:37:30.780 --> 01:37:31.700]   sources.
[01:37:31.700 --> 01:37:33.900]   And we get into the opening
[01:37:33.900 --> 01:37:36.420]   salvos of that, it's a big,
[01:37:36.420 --> 01:37:37.420]   big deal.
[01:37:37.420 --> 01:37:40.020]   Now, let me hit something really
[01:37:40.020 --> 01:37:40.940]   critical.
[01:37:40.940 --> 01:37:42.720]   If you try to watch any major
[01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:44.860]   Netflix movie, or you try to go to
[01:37:44.860 --> 01:37:46.960]   the movie theater, or you try to
[01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:49.380]   just go online, almost every major
[01:37:49.380 --> 01:37:51.660]   storyline, movie, you name it,
[01:37:51.660 --> 01:37:54.060]   has evil white people hurting black
[01:37:54.060 --> 01:37:54.700]   people.
[01:37:54.700 --> 01:37:57.020]   And then making hundreds of movies
[01:37:57.020 --> 01:37:59.460]   the last few years, where it's just
[01:37:59.460 --> 01:38:01.460]   saturated everywhere about
[01:38:01.460 --> 01:38:03.140]   injustices in the past.
[01:38:03.140 --> 01:38:04.900]   And the newest movies,
[01:38:04.900 --> 01:38:07.160]   The Purge, the first Purge,
[01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:09.220]   where it shows the army and
[01:38:09.220 --> 01:38:11.460]   the Trumpian like future,
[01:38:11.460 --> 01:38:13.820]   with Van Jones in the movie.
[01:38:13.820 --> 01:38:16.620]   With the army wearing KKK uniforms
[01:38:16.620 --> 01:38:19.500]   coming out and killing black people
[01:38:19.500 --> 01:38:21.260]   and their children.
[01:38:21.260 --> 01:38:23.740]   This is all a simulation to create
[01:38:23.740 --> 01:38:26.300]   the idea that this is happening.
[01:38:26.300 --> 01:38:28.780]   If you read the documents we got in
[01:38:28.780 --> 01:38:31.740]   January from 2015, where the Soros
[01:38:31.740 --> 01:38:34.280]   group was trying to create civil
[01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:36.340]   war and race war to bring in
[01:38:36.340 --> 01:38:37.500]   martial law.
[01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:39.020]   And it's their own documents where
[01:38:39.020 --> 01:38:40.500]   they're setting it up.
[01:38:40.500 --> 01:38:42.220]   It's their own documents where
[01:38:42.220 --> 01:38:44.140]   they're doing it, where they're in
[01:38:44.140 --> 01:38:45.580]   Maryland, in Baltimore and
[01:38:45.580 --> 01:38:46.840]   other blue city areas,
[01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:48.340]   working with local police.
[01:38:48.340 --> 01:38:50.840]   To stage attacks, burn this,
[01:38:50.840 --> 01:38:53.940]   attack that, it's why it's always
[01:38:53.940 --> 01:38:56.920]   stylized, turn over a dumpster,
[01:38:56.920 --> 01:38:58.380]   burn a trash can,
[01:38:58.380 --> 01:39:01.380]   knock out some corporate windows.
[01:39:01.380 --> 01:39:02.740]   And it says how to do it, and
[01:39:02.740 --> 01:39:04.100]   they're told where to go,
[01:39:04.100 --> 01:39:04.740]   what to do.
[01:39:04.740 --> 01:39:06.260]   They are trained actors,
[01:39:06.260 --> 01:39:08.620]   they're mainly college professors.
[01:39:08.620 --> 01:39:10.100]   And again, the family of one of
[01:39:10.100 --> 01:39:11.820]   these guys, when he got in trouble,
[01:39:11.820 --> 01:39:12.800]   got into his house and
[01:39:12.800 --> 01:39:13.940]   got all this material.
[01:39:13.940 --> 01:39:15.980]   And again, the media has never
[01:39:15.980 --> 01:39:16.580]   covered this and
[01:39:16.580 --> 01:39:17.740]   no one else has ever picked it up.
[01:39:17.740 --> 01:39:20.260]   They don't want anybody looking.
[01:39:20.260 --> 01:39:21.820]   This is criminal racketeering,
[01:39:21.820 --> 01:39:22.420]   in my view.
[01:39:22.420 --> 01:39:23.260]   We need indictments by
[01:39:23.260 --> 01:39:24.380]   the Justice Department.
[01:39:24.380 --> 01:39:25.820]   This is Soros' son running all
[01:39:25.820 --> 01:39:27.740]   this, this is unbelievable.
[01:39:27.740 --> 01:39:28.980]   And they sign on to it,
[01:39:28.980 --> 01:39:30.940]   their action plan, everything.
[01:39:30.940 --> 01:39:32.500]   And so when you see the massive
[01:39:32.500 --> 01:39:33.900]   level of brainwashing,
[01:39:33.900 --> 01:39:35.540]   you know what they're trying to do.
[01:39:35.540 --> 01:39:36.740]   They're trying to get a Charlottesville
[01:39:36.740 --> 01:39:37.780]   type event going.
[01:39:37.780 --> 01:39:39.340]   They're trying to get normal anti
[01:39:39.340 --> 01:39:40.260]   Trump crowds out.
[01:39:40.260 --> 01:39:41.900]   Then they're trying to have some
[01:39:41.900 --> 01:39:43.260]   white supremacist or white
[01:39:43.260 --> 01:39:44.940]   supremacist like type groups come
[01:39:44.940 --> 01:39:46.140]   that are obviously led by
[01:39:46.140 --> 01:39:48.060]   the globalists that's even come out.
[01:39:48.060 --> 01:39:49.660]   To then have the clash and
[01:39:49.660 --> 01:39:51.340]   then blame it on Trump and
[01:39:51.340 --> 01:39:53.580]   America to create an explosion in
[01:39:53.580 --> 01:39:54.620]   this country.
[01:39:54.620 --> 01:39:56.540]   And the removal of the Confederate
[01:39:56.540 --> 01:39:58.020]   statues and all of this,
[01:39:58.020 --> 01:39:59.740]   the people just wander by and
[01:39:59.740 --> 01:40:01.380]   don't even care about.
[01:40:01.380 --> 01:40:02.740]   It's all just done to create
[01:40:02.740 --> 01:40:03.860]   a tender box.
[01:40:03.860 --> 01:40:04.860]   And you can see it in the news,
[01:40:04.860 --> 01:40:05.540]   they're hyping it,
[01:40:05.540 --> 01:40:06.220]   they're hyping it,
[01:40:06.220 --> 01:40:06.940]   they're hyping it,
[01:40:06.940 --> 01:40:07.620]   they're hyping it.
[01:40:07.620 --> 01:40:09.820]   Now, when we come back, before I go
[01:40:09.820 --> 01:40:11.980]   to your calls, what are they really
[01:40:11.980 --> 01:40:13.540]   hyping other than that,
[01:40:13.540 --> 01:40:15.260]   even bigger than race war?
[01:40:15.260 --> 01:40:16.500]   This just went up on
[01:40:16.500 --> 01:40:18.940]   Infowars.com, it's an exclusive,
[01:40:18.940 --> 01:40:21.020]   nobody else has picked this up.
[01:40:21.020 --> 01:40:22.500]   Drag Tots, cartoon,
[01:40:22.500 --> 01:40:24.700]   sparks outrage, baby drag queen
[01:40:24.700 --> 01:40:26.620]   cartoon, marketed to young
[01:40:26.620 --> 01:40:28.020]   children.
[01:40:28.020 --> 01:40:29.940]   And again, we've gone to, in fact,
[01:40:29.940 --> 01:40:30.780]   it's back there in
[01:40:30.780 --> 01:40:31.940]   the producer's office.
[01:40:31.940 --> 01:40:34.620]   We've gone to Target before and
[01:40:34.620 --> 01:40:37.100]   then seen the feminist baby.
[01:40:37.100 --> 01:40:38.980]   And she's not going to be a girl,
[01:40:38.980 --> 01:40:41.140]   she's going to be a boy.
[01:40:41.140 --> 01:40:42.220]   And there's a little picture of
[01:40:42.220 --> 01:40:42.980]   her naked butt in it,
[01:40:42.980 --> 01:40:44.100]   it's all very weird.
[01:40:44.100 --> 01:40:45.900]   And this is so creepy, folks,
[01:40:45.900 --> 01:40:47.820]   this is pedophilia, in my view,
[01:40:47.820 --> 01:40:49.060]   this whole agenda.
[01:40:49.060 --> 01:40:50.500]   I'm not saying these people are
[01:40:50.500 --> 01:40:52.060]   that made this, but the agenda of
[01:40:52.060 --> 01:40:53.340]   sexualizing children,
[01:40:53.340 --> 01:40:55.020]   going into the schools, going in
[01:40:55.020 --> 01:40:56.820]   when they're three, four, five,
[01:40:56.820 --> 01:40:58.660]   six, seven years old, and showing
[01:40:58.660 --> 01:41:00.260]   them this and confusing them,
[01:41:00.260 --> 01:41:01.740]   is designed to create mental
[01:41:01.740 --> 01:41:02.600]   illness.
[01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:04.360]   And Camille Paglia is a classical
[01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:05.780]   liberal and a lesbian, and
[01:41:05.780 --> 01:41:06.940]   she'll tell you that.
[01:41:06.940 --> 01:41:07.780]   That's a fact.
[01:41:07.780 --> 01:41:09.140]   I'm a libertarian,
[01:41:09.140 --> 01:41:10.540]   this is not adult activity.
[01:41:10.540 --> 01:41:11.540]   This is targeting children.
[01:41:11.540 --> 01:41:13.620]   Now here it is, baby feminist.
[01:41:13.620 --> 01:41:14.940]   And then she says she's a boy
[01:41:14.940 --> 01:41:15.460]   in here.
[01:41:15.460 --> 01:41:17.740]   Again, it isn't about a woman if
[01:41:17.740 --> 01:41:19.180]   she wants to be a man being a man
[01:41:19.180 --> 01:41:20.140]   or thinking she is,
[01:41:20.140 --> 01:41:21.900]   it's about them force feeding it.
[01:41:21.900 --> 01:41:24.020]   It's all coming up in the next
[01:41:24.020 --> 01:41:26.180]   segment, and then your phone calls.
[01:41:26.180 --> 01:41:27.780]   Now that said, if you don't
[01:41:27.780 --> 01:41:29.060]   support us, Soros and
[01:41:29.060 --> 01:41:30.660]   the Globalists will win.
[01:41:30.660 --> 01:41:32.020]   It's not like we're some side
[01:41:32.020 --> 01:41:33.740]   group and we're just saying that.
[01:41:33.740 --> 01:41:35.220]   We are the tip of the spear.
[01:41:35.220 --> 01:41:36.460]   We're under the most attack
[01:41:36.460 --> 01:41:38.020]   because we're moving the ball down
[01:41:38.020 --> 01:41:39.540]   the field, and they know full and
[01:41:39.540 --> 01:41:40.980]   goodwill, we're a conduit for
[01:41:40.980 --> 01:41:42.420]   the make America great again,
[01:41:42.420 --> 01:41:44.300]   make the planet victorious agenda,
[01:41:44.300 --> 01:41:46.300]   pro-human, anti-eugenics agenda.
[01:41:46.300 --> 01:41:47.580]   We are the vanguard,
[01:41:47.580 --> 01:41:49.420]   we are the attack ship that goes
[01:41:49.420 --> 01:41:51.380]   out from the mothership and goes
[01:41:51.380 --> 01:41:53.140]   in and draws the enemy fire.
[01:41:53.140 --> 01:41:54.460]   We are the vanguard,
[01:41:54.460 --> 01:41:56.180]   and goes in and draws the enemy
[01:41:56.180 --> 01:41:58.180]   fire, if they can get us shut down,
[01:41:58.180 --> 01:42:00.020]   they believe it's a devastating
[01:42:00.020 --> 01:42:02.180]   victory, so recommit this July 4th,
[01:42:02.180 --> 01:42:04.020]   which I'm calling the kickoff of

[01:42:10.820 --> 01:42:11.820]   we're launching ours.
[01:42:11.820 --> 01:42:13.660]   So the second American revolution

[01:42:53.780 --> 01:42:55.460]   filth, control freaks and
[01:42:55.460 --> 01:42:57.460]   devil worshippers worldwide.
[01:42:57.460 --> 01:42:59.060]   >> This 4th of July is special,

[01:43:00.260 --> 01:43:01.260]   they can feel it.
[01:43:01.260 --> 01:43:03.100]   The globalists are attempting to
[01:43:03.100 --> 01:43:05.140]   kill a worldwide awakening to their
[01:43:05.140 --> 01:43:07.180]   tyranny, and America, yet again,
[01:43:07.180 --> 01:43:09.100]   is at the heart of the resistance,
[01:43:09.100 --> 01:43:10.100]   the globalists.
[01:43:10.100 --> 01:43:11.580]   That's why this 4th of July,
[01:43:11.580 --> 01:43:12.940]   I'm asking all of our great
[01:43:12.940 --> 01:43:14.700]   supporters to think about InfoWars
[01:43:14.700 --> 01:43:15.740]   now more than ever.
[01:43:15.740 --> 01:43:17.340]   And what would the world be like if
[01:43:17.340 --> 01:43:18.980]   InfoWars wasn't there resisting
[01:43:18.980 --> 01:43:19.900]   the globalists?
[01:43:19.900 --> 01:43:21.220]   What would have happened if you
[01:43:21.220 --> 01:43:22.220]   supported InfoWars?
[01:43:22.220 --> 01:43:23.700]   We would not be having the victories
[01:43:23.700 --> 01:43:24.300]   we have today.
[01:43:24.300 --> 01:43:25.500]   So yes, a lot of good things
[01:43:25.500 --> 01:43:26.380]   are happening, but
[01:43:26.380 --> 01:43:27.660]   the enemy is striking back.
[01:43:27.660 --> 01:43:29.420]   So please, think about InfoWars and
[01:43:29.420 --> 01:43:31.140]   funding our operation while you get

[01:43:55.500 --> 01:43:57.340]   InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:43:57.340 --> 01:43:59.340]   >> Living in volcano may sound more
[01:43:59.340 --> 01:44:01.100]   dramatic than it really is.
[01:44:01.100 --> 01:44:03.060]   The real drama can be found here in
[01:44:03.060 --> 01:44:04.180]   Leilani Estates.
[01:44:04.180 --> 01:44:05.940]   But a lot of us on the big island
[01:44:05.940 --> 01:44:07.340]   rely on rainwater, and
[01:44:07.340 --> 01:44:09.420]   we need to be concerned about ash and
[01:44:09.420 --> 01:44:10.180]   acid rain.
[01:44:10.180 --> 01:44:12.580]   Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal
[01:44:12.580 --> 01:44:15.100]   particles, and acid rain could lower
[01:44:15.100 --> 01:44:17.220]   the pH of the water to unhealthy
[01:44:17.220 --> 01:44:17.860]   levels.
[01:44:17.860 --> 01:44:18.860]   To find out,
[01:44:18.860 --> 01:44:21.260]   we employed a series of tests for
[01:44:21.260 --> 01:44:23.900]   heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[01:44:23.900 --> 01:44:25.820]   What we learned was that there was
[01:44:25.820 --> 01:44:27.740]   in fact unhealthy levels of heavy
[01:44:27.740 --> 01:44:29.900]   metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[01:44:29.900 --> 01:44:31.900]   Next, we tested the water from our
[01:44:31.900 --> 01:44:33.620]   AlexaPure gravity filter.
[01:44:33.620 --> 01:44:35.620]   And not only were the heavy metal
[01:44:35.620 --> 01:44:37.620]   levels within safe measure, but
[01:44:37.620 --> 01:44:39.740]   the pH was also restored to optimal
[01:44:39.740 --> 01:44:40.420]   levels.
[01:44:40.420 --> 01:44:42.500]   As it turns out, the filter on
[01:44:42.500 --> 01:44:44.660]   the AlexaPure raises the pH of
[01:44:44.660 --> 01:44:45.580]   the water.
[01:44:45.580 --> 01:44:47.460]   So what we've learned is that
[01:44:47.460 --> 01:44:49.420]   volcanic ash and acid rain can
[01:44:49.420 --> 01:44:51.540]   contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:44:51.540 --> 01:44:53.140]   But more importantly,
[01:44:53.140 --> 01:44:55.540]   a good water filtration system will
[01:44:55.540 --> 01:44:56.340]   purify it.

[01:46:52.060 --> 01:46:52.580]   And it's so
[01:46:52.580 --> 01:46:53.820]   essential to spread the word.
[01:46:53.820 --> 01:46:54.700]   Again, thank you so much for
[01:46:54.700 --> 01:46:56.380]   being part of the second American
[01:46:56.380 --> 01:46:57.020]   revolution.

[01:47:31.340 --> 01:47:33.020]   break down that's extremely
[01:47:33.020 --> 01:47:33.860]   disturbing.
[01:47:33.860 --> 01:47:35.940]   And I'd say parental discretion is
[01:47:35.940 --> 01:47:37.700]   advised, but this is what's
[01:47:37.700 --> 01:47:39.940]   targeting your children in target.

[01:47:41.980 --> 01:47:44.180]   stuff like this is being sold.
[01:47:44.180 --> 01:47:47.260]   The story is up on InfoWars.com.
[01:47:47.260 --> 01:47:50.780]   Drag Tots cartoon sparks outrage.
[01:47:50.780 --> 01:47:52.780]   Baby drag queen cartoon marketed to
[01:47:52.780 --> 01:47:53.860]   young children.
[01:47:53.860 --> 01:47:56.140]   Now, and they're actually modeled
[01:47:56.140 --> 01:47:58.260]   after some of these hideous looking
[01:47:58.260 --> 01:48:00.180]   obese men that we've seen in New
[01:48:00.180 --> 01:48:02.340]   York and everywhere that they roll
[01:48:02.340 --> 01:48:04.500]   out at story time for little kids.
[01:48:04.500 --> 01:48:06.020]   And we've played the video where
[01:48:06.020 --> 01:48:06.780]   they're like,
[01:48:06.780 --> 01:48:08.220]   you're going to be a drag queen.
[01:48:08.220 --> 01:48:08.980]   Shake your butt.
[01:48:09.740 --> 01:48:10.580]   Do all this and
[01:48:10.580 --> 01:48:12.900]   then they sexualize the children.
[01:48:12.900 --> 01:48:14.580]   Paint them up, tell them that
[01:48:14.580 --> 01:48:15.980]   there's something else.
[01:48:15.980 --> 01:48:17.500]   And then they had the drag queen
[01:48:17.500 --> 01:48:19.100]   festival this year here in Austin.
[01:48:19.100 --> 01:48:22.340]   It showed little children as young
[01:48:22.340 --> 01:48:25.140]   as two toddling up and putting
[01:48:25.140 --> 01:48:28.300]   money in the g string of obese men
[01:48:28.300 --> 01:48:29.820]   wearing wedge.
[01:48:29.820 --> 01:48:32.140]   I mean, it'd be bad enough if
[01:48:32.140 --> 01:48:35.060]   the guys actually look like women,
[01:48:35.060 --> 01:48:37.180]   but it's a celebration of
[01:48:37.180 --> 01:48:38.500]   hideousness.
[01:48:39.500 --> 01:48:40.860]   And that's all part of this plan.
[01:48:40.860 --> 01:48:43.140]   And so this is being done
[01:48:43.140 --> 01:48:44.100]   everywhere and
[01:48:44.100 --> 01:48:46.420]   they're sexualizing children.
[01:48:46.420 --> 01:48:48.340]   It is completely outrageous.
[01:48:48.340 --> 01:48:52.100]   It's never too early to slip into
[01:48:52.100 --> 01:48:53.620]   your first pair of heels,
[01:48:53.620 --> 01:48:55.260]   conjure your cheekbones and
[01:48:55.260 --> 01:48:57.420]   learn the basics of drag culture.
[01:48:57.420 --> 01:48:58.940]   Reads an announcement for
[01:48:58.940 --> 01:49:00.940]   drag tots an upcoming cartoon about
[01:49:00.940 --> 01:49:02.020]   baby drag queens.
[01:49:02.020 --> 01:49:03.780]   See, how do you sexualize children?
[01:49:03.780 --> 01:49:04.780]   This is how you do it.
[01:49:04.780 --> 01:49:07.260]   And the event in Austin, I mean,
[01:49:07.260 --> 01:49:09.740]   it was men twerking, obese men
[01:49:09.740 --> 01:49:12.220]   twerking, show it, show it,
[01:49:12.220 --> 01:49:14.500]   in front of small children.
[01:49:14.500 --> 01:49:17.220]   And we've got men pole dancing and
[01:49:17.220 --> 01:49:20.180]   shaking their butts in children's
[01:49:20.180 --> 01:49:20.820]   face.
[01:49:20.820 --> 01:49:22.340]   Here, let's show TV viewers when
[01:49:22.340 --> 01:49:23.620]   the little children run up and
[01:49:23.620 --> 01:49:24.580]   give them the money.
[01:49:24.580 --> 01:49:28.420]   So would you take a three year old
[01:49:28.420 --> 01:49:30.620]   to the yellow rose here in Austin,
[01:49:30.620 --> 01:49:32.660]   Texas, that's a straight strip
[01:49:32.660 --> 01:49:33.180]   club.
[01:49:33.180 --> 01:49:34.900]   I mean, I personally not my cup of
[01:49:34.900 --> 01:49:35.420]   tea.
[01:49:35.420 --> 01:49:36.540]   I've been in college,
[01:49:36.540 --> 01:49:38.100]   one time Joe Rogan wanted to go
[01:49:38.100 --> 01:49:39.580]   like 18 years ago we went.
[01:49:39.580 --> 01:49:41.300]   Yeah, I've been to topless bars,
[01:49:41.300 --> 01:49:42.420]   been to plenty of them,
[01:49:42.420 --> 01:49:43.340]   don't like them.
[01:49:43.340 --> 01:49:45.220]   But I'm not condemning people to
[01:49:45.220 --> 01:49:46.340]   want to go to them.
[01:49:46.340 --> 01:49:48.480]   But the point is, is that,
[01:49:48.480 --> 01:49:50.620]   if I saw people at a strip club
[01:49:50.620 --> 01:49:53.300]   with a two year old sticking a $10
[01:49:53.300 --> 01:49:55.820]   bill in a woman's G string, I'd
[01:49:55.820 --> 01:49:58.380]   walk up and say, what the hell is
[01:49:58.380 --> 01:49:59.580]   your problem?
[01:49:59.580 --> 01:50:01.620]   But when they do it, and by the
[01:50:01.620 --> 01:50:04.060]   way, there's some photos we put in
[01:50:04.060 --> 01:50:06.340]   the video that I don't even know
[01:50:06.340 --> 01:50:08.540]   if I should show, like children
[01:50:08.540 --> 01:50:10.740]   naked with only glitter on their
[01:50:10.740 --> 01:50:12.500]   bodies next to men with only
[01:50:12.500 --> 01:50:14.380]   glitter on their genitals.
[01:50:14.380 --> 01:50:16.380]   And I mean, you talk about a freak
[01:50:16.380 --> 01:50:18.300]   show, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:50:18.300 --> 01:50:20.220]   I mean, this is the culture,
[01:50:20.220 --> 01:50:22.220]   this is the cult of sexualizing
[01:50:22.220 --> 01:50:22.980]   children.
[01:50:22.980 --> 01:50:25.180]   And children practicing strip
[01:50:25.180 --> 01:50:27.020]   teases, I can't look and
[01:50:27.020 --> 01:50:29.740]   getting money for it, take it down,
[01:50:29.740 --> 01:50:30.860]   take it down.
[01:50:30.860 --> 01:50:32.740]   This is truly an abomination.
[01:50:32.740 --> 01:50:36.180]   But see, because it's gay or
[01:50:36.180 --> 01:50:37.700]   it's liberal, it's okay.
[01:50:37.700 --> 01:50:39.200]   This is just like the guy got
[01:50:39.200 --> 01:50:40.740]   busted this week, running
[01:50:40.740 --> 01:50:42.580]   the big children's charity for
[01:50:42.580 --> 01:50:44.500]   abused and kidnapped children.
[01:50:44.500 --> 01:50:46.020]   And he was trying to have sex with
[01:50:46.020 --> 01:50:47.540]   a two year old and admitted he'd
[01:50:47.540 --> 01:50:48.980]   had sex with small children.
[01:50:48.980 --> 01:50:50.580]   He's pled guilty, I mean,
[01:50:50.580 --> 01:50:52.540]   he's admitted that he's had any,
[01:50:52.540 --> 01:50:53.740]   what's the symbol?
[01:50:53.740 --> 01:50:56.020]   The Disney symbol, but rainbow.
[01:50:56.020 --> 01:50:58.540]   And we're just sexualizing your
[01:50:58.540 --> 01:51:00.260]   kid, so they're not sexist or
[01:51:00.260 --> 01:51:01.780]   they're not homophobic.
[01:51:01.780 --> 01:51:03.740]   Meanwhile, he'd like to have sex
[01:51:03.740 --> 01:51:05.700]   with your two year old daughter.
[01:51:07.620 --> 01:51:09.580]   But see, he runs the human rights
[01:51:09.580 --> 01:51:11.380]   operation, he oversees and
[01:51:11.380 --> 01:51:12.940]   see everyone's equal.
[01:51:12.940 --> 01:51:14.380]   So a man wants to have sex with
[01:51:14.380 --> 01:51:15.380]   your two year old,
[01:51:15.380 --> 01:51:16.980]   no matter if it rips their guts
[01:51:16.980 --> 01:51:18.580]   off, I'm going to do it because
[01:51:18.580 --> 01:51:19.500]   it's liberal.
[01:51:19.500 --> 01:51:21.300]   Now, watch this cartoon.
[01:51:21.300 --> 01:51:23.140]   Your radio listener,
[01:51:23.140 --> 01:51:24.860]   the drag queens have sharp teeth,
[01:51:24.860 --> 01:51:26.100]   they're like demons.
[01:51:26.100 --> 01:51:28.340]   Hi kids, put on panties, yeah,
[01:51:28.340 --> 01:51:30.580]   here, learn to shake your butt for
[01:51:30.580 --> 01:51:32.900]   the man, yeah, you're another sex
[01:51:32.900 --> 01:51:35.300]   now, we're not introducing Satan as
[01:51:35.300 --> 01:51:37.340]   a bad idea, this isn't like the
[01:51:37.340 --> 01:51:39.540]   people wearing satanic rituals,
[01:51:39.540 --> 01:51:41.300]   outfits like clowns, no,
[01:51:41.300 --> 01:51:43.740]   this is children's programming in
[01:51:43.740 --> 01:51:45.700]   Hollywood, sure we hope your
[01:51:45.700 --> 01:51:48.140]   economy collapses, sure drink some

[01:51:54.860 --> 01:51:57.380]   socialize and the kids be friendly.

[01:53:31.200 --> 01:53:32.100]   a drag tot.
[01:53:32.100 --> 01:53:33.900]   And we're going to use the most
[01:53:33.900 --> 01:53:35.540]   hideous examples of this to
[01:53:35.540 --> 01:53:37.420]   absolutely break your will and
[01:53:37.420 --> 01:53:39.020]   make you accept all of it.
[01:53:39.020 --> 01:53:41.140]   And it's all Tabastock Institute in
[01:53:41.140 --> 01:53:42.820]   the UK, they're paying for
[01:53:42.820 --> 01:53:44.500]   young children to have their
[01:53:44.500 --> 01:53:45.620]   genitals cut off.
[01:53:45.620 --> 01:53:47.380]   So you want to know how society
[01:53:47.380 --> 01:53:47.900]   falls?
[01:53:47.900 --> 01:53:49.780]   The sickness, the decadence of
[01:53:49.780 --> 01:53:51.780]   Hollywood and the entertainment
[01:53:51.780 --> 01:53:53.860]   industry and the fashion industry
[01:53:53.860 --> 01:53:55.940]   like a weapon spewing pure death at
[01:53:55.940 --> 01:53:57.180]   everyone you know.
[01:53:57.180 --> 01:53:59.860]   And just, see, it's all high.
[01:53:59.860 --> 01:54:01.220]   Hey, pull up the Satanists,
[01:54:01.220 --> 01:54:02.480]   they're in the Daily Mail.
[01:54:02.480 --> 01:54:04.220]   How they dress in the rituals and
[01:54:04.220 --> 01:54:05.640]   it's outfits like that.
[01:54:05.640 --> 01:54:07.620]   Just all crazy and scary and
[01:54:07.620 --> 01:54:09.500]   everyone, hi kids, hi,
[01:54:09.500 --> 01:54:11.860]   I'm going to teach you about your
[01:54:11.860 --> 01:54:12.380]   sex.
[01:54:12.380 --> 01:54:13.980]   Normally it'd be when you're 10 or
[01:54:13.980 --> 01:54:15.580]   11 years old, your parents would
[01:54:15.580 --> 01:54:17.100]   tell you the basics, but that's
[01:54:17.100 --> 01:54:18.600]   okay, you're four years old,
[01:54:18.600 --> 01:54:19.900]   you're three years old,
[01:54:19.900 --> 01:54:21.640]   I'm going to teach you now, okay?
[01:54:21.640 --> 01:54:24.580]   Here I'm going to teach you how it
[01:54:24.580 --> 01:54:27.700]   is, I'm Epstein's Heraclant.
[01:54:27.700 --> 01:54:28.980]   [LAUGH] Yes,
[01:54:28.980 --> 01:54:31.620]   they're going to teach you how it
[01:54:31.620 --> 01:54:34.340]   is, they're going to teach you and
[01:54:34.340 --> 01:54:37.180]   do whatever we want, it's all about
[01:54:37.180 --> 01:54:39.420]   us, your kids belong to us.
[01:54:39.420 --> 01:54:39.920]   [LAUGH]
[01:54:39.920 --> 01:54:49.340]   >> You can show the story times
[01:54:49.340 --> 01:54:50.960]   from Austin, Texas to New York City
[01:54:50.960 --> 01:54:52.460]   where they take two year olds and
[01:54:52.460 --> 01:54:53.960]   there will be obese, bizarre
[01:54:53.960 --> 01:54:55.580]   looking crazy men with vampire
[01:54:55.580 --> 01:54:57.160]   fangs and devil horns going,
[01:54:57.160 --> 01:54:58.960]   I like to teach you about how
[01:54:58.960 --> 01:55:01.200]   you're going to be a girl if you're
[01:55:01.200 --> 01:55:03.240]   a boy or a boy if you're a girl.
[01:55:03.240 --> 01:55:05.240]   And we're putting chemicals in
[01:55:05.240 --> 01:55:07.500]   the water to help with everything,
[01:55:07.500 --> 01:55:09.600]   and it's going to get a lot easier
[01:55:09.600 --> 01:55:11.680]   from her owner to bring down this
[01:55:11.680 --> 01:55:13.520]   third dimension down to us,
[01:55:13.520 --> 01:55:15.420]   we're going to destroy you,
[01:55:15.420 --> 01:55:17.160]   you will ascend to hell in
[01:55:17.160 --> 01:55:18.600]   the reverse order.
[01:55:18.600 --> 01:55:22.800]   I get it, you're so enlightened,
[01:55:22.800 --> 01:55:25.600]   you're so powerful.
[01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:29.240]   You're weak, we've been asleep,
[01:55:29.240 --> 01:55:32.640]   and now we're awake and now you can
[01:55:32.640 --> 01:55:36.080]   feel the spirit of Christ reentering
[01:55:36.080 --> 01:55:38.440]   the planet as you panic.
[01:55:38.440 --> 01:55:40.600]   And all of your, look how weak and
[01:55:40.600 --> 01:55:42.460]   slobbering and pathetic and
[01:55:42.460 --> 01:55:44.660]   chicken necked all their servants
[01:55:44.660 --> 01:55:47.000]   are, sucked, soul sucked fallen
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.400]   slaves, but behind them is always
[01:55:49.400 --> 01:55:51.680]   the Dracula's, and they now know
[01:55:51.680 --> 01:55:53.760]   fear, because they're going to
[01:55:53.760 --> 01:55:55.440]   burn you, now no fear.
[01:55:55.440 --> 01:55:57.160]   Because we're coming like
[01:55:57.160 --> 01:55:59.120]   the villagers in the night with
[01:55:59.120 --> 01:56:01.160]   the torches burning bright with
[01:56:01.160 --> 01:56:03.300]   fire, fire is not the weapon of
[01:56:03.300 --> 01:56:05.720]   evil, fire is the weapon of good,
[01:56:05.720 --> 01:56:07.520]   and it will consume you.
[01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:13.040]   [LAUGH]
[01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:17.760]   Yes, you don't have to fear your
[01:56:17.760 --> 01:56:21.560]   God, you need to fear God.
[01:56:21.560 --> 01:56:25.200]   Your God has stolen your soul,
[01:56:25.200 --> 01:56:28.840]   your God took away the key that
[01:56:28.840 --> 01:56:32.240]   you gave it, and now you stare
[01:56:32.240 --> 01:56:35.560]   into the fathomless depths of
[01:56:35.560 --> 01:56:39.640]   eternal phantom zone destruction.
[01:56:39.640 --> 01:56:41.240]   And you want to take as many
[01:56:41.240 --> 01:56:43.160]   children with you down that hole
[01:56:43.160 --> 01:56:44.860]   as you can, so you can clutch
[01:56:44.860 --> 01:56:46.720]   their souls as you fall towards
[01:56:46.720 --> 01:56:48.840]   the dark heart of that black hole.
[01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:52.480]   Soon the icy cold of hell will
[01:56:52.480 --> 01:56:56.760]   embrace you forever, soon you will
[01:56:56.760 --> 01:57:00.040]   pass through and on, never to
[01:57:00.040 --> 01:57:04.000]   return to this dimension, never to
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:07.720]   ascend, but down, down, down,
[01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:10.040]   down, down, down,
[01:57:10.040 --> 01:57:13.680]   into that black hole you're going,
[01:57:13.680 --> 01:57:14.720]   chained.
[01:57:14.720 --> 01:57:15.760]   And by the way, you think God's
[01:57:15.760 --> 01:57:16.600]   going to let you get all those
[01:57:16.600 --> 01:57:17.560]   kids, that's why you try to corrupt
[01:57:17.560 --> 01:57:18.560]   them so early, you're not going to
[01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:19.560]   get them, because the people
[01:57:19.560 --> 01:57:20.560]   that you've abused will be
[01:57:20.560 --> 01:57:21.560]   the strongest people ever that
[01:57:21.560 --> 01:57:22.560]   will turn against you and
[01:57:22.560 --> 01:57:23.560]   bring you down.
[01:57:23.560 --> 01:57:26.400]   Because from the foundations of
[01:57:26.400 --> 01:57:29.120]   the earth, you are losers, and
[01:57:29.120 --> 01:57:32.080]   you are always to be there to test
[01:57:32.080 --> 01:57:33.400]   the righteous.

[02:00:06.840 --> 02:00:09.920]   2018, another epic July 4th
[02:00:09.920 --> 02:00:12.440]   has come and gone and never
[02:00:12.440 --> 02:00:13.800]   has it been more clear where
[02:00:13.800 --> 02:00:15.680]   the stakes are for humanity.
[02:00:15.680 --> 02:00:17.000]   But I want to make a point.
[02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:18.200]   There's a Churchill quote,
[02:00:18.200 --> 02:00:21.640]   I'm paraphrasing it, that many
[02:00:21.640 --> 02:00:23.360]   people get hit by history.
[02:00:23.360 --> 02:00:25.560]   They get run over in the street by
[02:00:25.560 --> 02:00:27.360]   huge, big, epic developments, and
[02:00:27.360 --> 02:00:29.080]   they kind of dust themselves off
[02:00:29.080 --> 02:00:30.680]   and ignore the point in history
[02:00:30.680 --> 02:00:32.080]   that they're in.
[02:00:32.080 --> 02:00:33.640]   But there are other people that
[02:00:33.640 --> 02:00:34.720]   get hit by destiny and
[02:00:34.720 --> 02:00:36.280]   hit by history, and they get up
[02:00:36.280 --> 02:00:38.000]   and it changes the course of their
[02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:39.800]   lives and countless other people's
[02:00:39.800 --> 02:00:40.280]   lives.
[02:00:40.280 --> 02:00:43.200]   And so I want people to remember
[02:00:43.200 --> 02:00:44.960]   that the hundreds of millions that
[02:00:44.960 --> 02:00:46.200]   died under communism and
[02:00:46.200 --> 02:00:47.760]   the tens of millions that died
[02:00:47.760 --> 02:00:49.440]   under fascism and other cults and
[02:00:49.440 --> 02:00:51.000]   permutations of governmental
[02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:52.600]   control and societal mental
[02:00:52.600 --> 02:00:54.520]   illness manifest by government,
[02:00:54.520 --> 02:00:56.360]   that we are on the precipice of
[02:00:56.360 --> 02:00:57.920]   a new global revolution,
[02:00:57.920 --> 02:00:59.520]   a new renaissance.
[02:00:59.520 --> 02:01:01.560]   And we're actually, because of
[02:01:01.560 --> 02:01:03.680]   other people's work before us,
[02:01:03.680 --> 02:01:05.800]   sitting on a great brain trust of
[02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:08.120]   human liberty, and that we've got
[02:01:08.120 --> 02:01:10.400]   a chance to fight for freedom when
[02:01:10.400 --> 02:01:12.800]   the odds are actually on our side.
[02:01:12.800 --> 02:01:14.680]   And we realize it.
[02:01:14.680 --> 02:01:16.800]   And we've got to look back on those
[02:01:16.800 --> 02:01:18.880]   that didn't have a chance to win,
[02:01:18.880 --> 02:01:20.760]   but took action and did what was
[02:01:20.760 --> 02:01:22.720]   right because it was about their
[02:01:22.720 --> 02:01:24.560]   soul and about the spiritual,
[02:01:24.560 --> 02:01:26.800]   cultural, human decision they were
[02:01:26.800 --> 02:01:28.840]   making, and that's why they were
[02:01:28.840 --> 02:01:29.600]   fulfilled.
[02:01:29.600 --> 02:01:31.520]   So again, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:01:31.520 --> 02:01:33.000]   I want to thank you all for
[02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:33.920]   your support.
[02:01:33.920 --> 02:01:35.080]   I want to thank you all for
[02:01:35.080 --> 02:01:35.800]   your prayers.
[02:01:35.800 --> 02:01:37.040]   I want to thank you all for
[02:01:37.040 --> 02:01:38.440]   what you've done against the
[02:01:38.440 --> 02:01:40.040]   bullies and the peer pressure over
[02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:40.640]   the years.
[02:01:40.640 --> 02:01:41.920]   Because if it wasn't for
[02:01:41.920 --> 02:01:43.280]   you, and if it wasn't for
[02:01:43.280 --> 02:01:44.760]   everything you've done,
[02:01:44.760 --> 02:01:46.000]   we wouldn't be here.
[02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.840]   Many of those people aren't here
[02:01:48.840 --> 02:01:51.080]   today that stood up for
[02:01:51.080 --> 02:01:52.600]   what was right.
[02:01:52.600 --> 02:01:54.800]   But in their gut, they believed in
[02:01:54.800 --> 02:01:57.080]   you, and they believed in me, and
[02:01:57.080 --> 02:01:59.320]   they believed that we could build
[02:01:59.320 --> 02:02:00.480]   a better future.
[02:02:00.480 --> 02:02:02.440]   They had goodwill towards people.
[02:02:02.440 --> 02:02:04.040]   They didn't want to use the fact
[02:02:04.040 --> 02:02:05.760]   that they had more knowledge than
[02:02:05.760 --> 02:02:07.560]   the average person to control that
[02:02:07.560 --> 02:02:08.080]   person.
[02:02:08.080 --> 02:02:09.680]   They didn't want to use the fact
[02:02:09.680 --> 02:02:11.360]   that they understood how the game
[02:02:11.360 --> 02:02:12.960]   was played to then set up a little
[02:02:12.960 --> 02:02:14.600]   secret cabal and feed on people.
[02:02:14.600 --> 02:02:17.280]   They had the true vision of human
[02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:19.640]   empowerment and the true mastery to
[02:02:19.640 --> 02:02:20.880]   empower others and
[02:02:20.880 --> 02:02:22.720]   bring them to the next level.
[02:02:22.720 --> 02:02:24.800]   They were Christ-like in their
[02:02:24.800 --> 02:02:26.800]   duty, in their focus, in their
[02:02:26.800 --> 02:02:29.080]   sacrifice, in their commitment.
[02:02:29.080 --> 02:02:31.640]   And so that's why it's obnoxious,
[02:02:31.640 --> 02:02:34.160]   it's flagrant, it's arrogant,
[02:02:34.160 --> 02:02:36.960]   it's narcissistic, it's satanic.
[02:02:36.960 --> 02:02:39.040]   To make the victories we're having
[02:02:39.040 --> 02:02:41.240]   about Trump, or about Infowars, or
[02:02:41.240 --> 02:02:43.520]   about anybody else, it's about you,
[02:02:43.520 --> 02:02:45.040]   and your awakening, and
[02:02:45.040 --> 02:02:46.840]   the decisions you've made.
[02:02:46.840 --> 02:02:48.360]   So I just want to tell you,
[02:02:48.360 --> 02:02:50.320]   as we've passed through this July
[02:02:50.320 --> 02:02:52.480]   4th, 2018, as the globalists launch
[02:02:52.480 --> 02:02:54.520]   their riots, and their attacks, and
[02:02:54.520 --> 02:02:56.520]   their lies, and their moralizing,
[02:02:56.520 --> 02:02:58.480]   that have good cheer, my friends,
[02:02:58.480 --> 02:03:00.320]   because we're living in a time and
[02:03:00.320 --> 02:03:02.120]   age when the devil knows the time
[02:03:02.120 --> 02:03:03.800]   is short, so he sends the beast
[02:03:03.800 --> 02:03:04.560]   with wrath.
[02:03:04.560 --> 02:03:06.480]   And there are whole world government
[02:03:06.480 --> 02:03:08.840]   systems here, the mark of the beast.
[02:03:08.840 --> 02:03:10.080]   It's going to be a lot of trials,
[02:03:10.080 --> 02:03:10.960]   a lot of tribulations.
[02:03:10.960 --> 02:03:12.880]   But we know the truth, and
[02:03:12.880 --> 02:03:14.520]   we know who wins, and
[02:03:14.520 --> 02:03:16.600]   we know where this all goes.
[02:03:16.600 --> 02:03:19.800]   And so that's a very positive fact
[02:03:19.800 --> 02:03:21.320]   to understand.
[02:03:21.320 --> 02:03:26.680]   All that matters is what you stand
[02:03:26.680 --> 02:03:27.180]   for.
[02:03:27.180 --> 02:03:28.880]   All that matters is not being
[02:03:28.880 --> 02:03:30.960]   a coward, and not feeding on people
[02:03:30.960 --> 02:03:32.720]   that aren't as smart as you.
[02:03:32.720 --> 02:03:34.760]   And the minute you realize that,
[02:03:34.760 --> 02:03:36.920]   you're in God's arms forever, and
[02:03:36.920 --> 02:03:39.560]   these Satanists, and these Crowleyites,
[02:03:39.560 --> 02:03:41.120]   and these Democrats, and
[02:03:41.120 --> 02:03:42.400]   these Chi-Coms, and
[02:03:42.400 --> 02:03:44.440]   all these control freaks who want
[02:03:44.440 --> 02:03:46.560]   to control reality, who want to try
[02:03:46.560 --> 02:03:48.560]   to become a god because they merge
[02:03:48.560 --> 02:03:50.480]   with AI technology, they don't
[02:03:50.480 --> 02:03:52.160]   understand they already had
[02:03:52.160 --> 02:03:53.520]   a connection to God.
[02:03:53.520 --> 02:03:55.080]   They were already an expression of
[02:03:55.080 --> 02:03:56.800]   God's consciousness in the universe,
[02:03:56.800 --> 02:03:58.240]   and there was no need to ever even
[02:03:58.240 --> 02:03:58.780]   do that.
[02:03:58.780 --> 02:04:00.280]   But that's why we have free will.
[02:04:00.280 --> 02:04:02.240]   Some people will fall to the lower
[02:04:02.240 --> 02:04:03.000]   dimension.
[02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:04.800]   Some people will rise and
[02:04:04.800 --> 02:04:07.040]   ascend towards a communion and
[02:04:07.040 --> 02:04:09.200]   a reunification with Christ.
[02:04:09.200 --> 02:04:10.720]   And that's the big choice, and
[02:04:10.720 --> 02:04:12.200]   that's why I know you've made
[02:04:12.200 --> 02:04:13.160]   the right choice.
[02:04:13.160 --> 02:04:14.520]   You're not going to find Christ in
[02:04:14.520 --> 02:04:15.720]   these whorehouse churches.
[02:04:15.720 --> 02:04:17.520]   That's where the literal globalist
[02:04:17.520 --> 02:04:19.120]   running operation via the World

[02:04:20.240 --> 02:04:22.240]   But you're going to find the real
[02:04:22.240 --> 02:04:23.600]   Christ in your heart,
[02:04:23.600 --> 02:04:25.400]   seeking after God and saying,
[02:04:25.400 --> 02:04:27.000]   I want to be a good person.
[02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:28.000]   I want to be just.
[02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:29.040]   I want to be honorable.
[02:04:29.040 --> 02:04:30.360]   I'm going to tell the truth.
[02:04:30.360 --> 02:04:32.240]   So again, are those of us here when
[02:04:32.240 --> 02:04:34.240]   we're seeing this great awakening,
[02:04:34.240 --> 02:04:35.000]   the heroes?
[02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:36.600]   No, the heroes are those in
[02:04:36.600 --> 02:04:38.720]   Communist China, and North Korea,
[02:04:38.720 --> 02:04:40.280]   and old Soviet Russia, and
[02:04:40.280 --> 02:04:42.200]   countless other places like Cuba
[02:04:42.200 --> 02:04:44.000]   that were tortured and murdered,
[02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:45.600]   and killed, and watched their
[02:04:45.600 --> 02:04:47.360]   children go to prison because they
[02:04:47.360 --> 02:04:48.760]   didn't deny God the truth.
[02:04:48.760 --> 02:04:50.280]   And to them on this July 4th,
[02:04:50.280 --> 02:04:51.560]   I want to thank you all and

[02:07:18.080 --> 02:07:19.760]   it's over for the globalist.

[02:07:49.080 --> 02:07:49.760]   >> Yeah.
[02:07:49.760 --> 02:07:51.240]   >> But did that stop him?
[02:07:51.240 --> 02:07:53.960]   No, it did not.
[02:07:53.960 --> 02:07:56.240]   It kept going, okay?
[02:07:56.240 --> 02:07:57.960]   It just, it went everywhere.

[02:09:27.680 --> 02:09:29.440]   very impressed, I hope.

[02:09:37.800 --> 02:09:39.360]   Because we can take even small
[02:09:39.360 --> 02:09:41.240]   radio stations that have no ratings
[02:09:41.240 --> 02:09:43.040]   and usually get them mid-level or
[02:09:43.040 --> 02:09:44.600]   high ratings within a year.
[02:09:44.600 --> 02:09:46.000]   Because that's how it works with
[02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:47.040]   Arbitron and all that,
[02:09:47.040 --> 02:09:48.040]   is name recognition.
[02:09:48.040 --> 02:09:49.200]   So you gotta say the name over and
[02:09:49.200 --> 02:09:49.720]   over again.
[02:09:49.720 --> 02:09:50.760]   The radio stations like that
[02:09:50.760 --> 02:09:51.720]   because that's how they stay
[02:09:51.720 --> 02:09:52.520]   afloat.
[02:09:52.520 --> 02:09:54.400]   Okay, we are back live well into
[02:09:54.400 --> 02:09:55.520]   the third hour.
[02:09:55.520 --> 02:09:57.120]   Our guests will be riding shotgun
[02:09:57.120 --> 02:09:58.200]   with us for the hour,
[02:09:58.200 --> 02:09:59.400]   maybe a little bit longer.
[02:09:59.400 --> 02:10:00.400]   I know we've got loaded phones.
[02:10:00.400 --> 02:10:01.600]   We'll also pop in and
[02:10:01.600 --> 02:10:03.160]   get your calls on Mueller,
[02:10:03.160 --> 02:10:04.720]   on the liberals calling for
[02:10:04.720 --> 02:10:06.200]   revolution, all of it.
[02:10:06.200 --> 02:10:08.120]   Joey Gibson is the founder of
[02:10:08.120 --> 02:10:10.080]   the Patriot Prayer Group and
[02:10:10.080 --> 02:10:11.960]   is running for US Senate as
[02:10:11.960 --> 02:10:13.080]   a Republican.
[02:10:13.080 --> 02:10:15.160]   Joey is fighting for freedom with
[02:10:15.160 --> 02:10:17.160]   the strength and power from God
[02:10:17.160 --> 02:10:19.640]   and love, gibsonforfreedom.com.
[02:10:19.640 --> 02:10:21.640]   And he goes out to these events,
[02:10:21.640 --> 02:10:23.480]   he just has prayer vigils.
[02:10:23.480 --> 02:10:25.320]   And the left gets really triggered
[02:10:25.320 --> 02:10:26.600]   by that and comes out.
[02:10:26.600 --> 02:10:27.480]   And they do it up and
[02:10:27.480 --> 02:10:28.520]   down the West Coast.
[02:10:28.520 --> 02:10:29.800]   Will Johnson also does it,
[02:10:29.800 --> 02:10:31.200]   unitedamericanfirst.com,
[02:10:31.200 --> 02:10:32.320]   what a great website, but
[02:10:32.320 --> 02:10:33.960]   even greater info he's involved in.
[02:10:33.960 --> 02:10:34.640]   He's a founder of
[02:10:34.640 --> 02:10:35.600]   United American First,
[02:10:35.600 --> 02:10:36.720]   a movement that began during
[02:10:36.720 --> 02:10:37.480]   2016 election.
[02:10:37.480 --> 02:10:38.680]   And I've heard him talk on my show
[02:10:38.680 --> 02:10:39.480]   and others about it.
[02:10:39.480 --> 02:10:40.960]   He just kept seeing the lies and
[02:10:40.960 --> 02:10:41.960]   the race baiting and
[02:10:41.960 --> 02:10:42.800]   how evil it was.
[02:10:42.800 --> 02:10:44.080]   And he just had this knot in his
[02:10:44.080 --> 02:10:45.320]   gut, this knot in his chest.
[02:10:45.320 --> 02:10:46.080]   I'm the same way.
[02:10:46.080 --> 02:10:47.280]   I can be totally exhausted,
[02:10:47.280 --> 02:10:48.160]   like eight at night,
[02:10:48.160 --> 02:10:49.160]   something big happens.
[02:10:49.160 --> 02:10:50.200]   I just suddenly have all this
[02:10:50.200 --> 02:10:50.720]   energy.
[02:10:50.720 --> 02:10:51.680]   When they attack me too,
[02:10:51.680 --> 02:10:52.960]   I don't like being attacked when I
[02:10:52.960 --> 02:10:53.800]   know they're lying.
[02:10:53.800 --> 02:10:55.320]   I suddenly, it doesn't make me get
[02:10:55.320 --> 02:10:56.760]   scared when they do these horrible
[02:10:56.760 --> 02:10:57.400]   things to me.
[02:10:57.400 --> 02:10:58.080]   It's the opposite.
[02:10:58.080 --> 02:10:59.480]   People say, you're so brave.
[02:10:59.480 --> 02:11:00.000]   Brave?
[02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.200]   I'd really be brave.
[02:11:02.200 --> 02:11:02.920]   I just laid down and
[02:11:02.920 --> 02:11:04.400]   let these dogs chew my guts out.
[02:11:04.400 --> 02:11:05.000]   It's the opposite.
[02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:06.600]   I'm fighting for my life here.
[02:11:06.600 --> 02:11:07.480]   These people are evil.
[02:11:07.480 --> 02:11:09.880]   That's what we're talking
[02:11:09.880 --> 02:11:10.600]   about here.
[02:11:10.600 --> 02:11:12.440]   So Will Johnson and Joey Gibson,
[02:11:12.440 --> 02:11:13.760]   let's go to Will first,
[02:11:13.760 --> 02:11:15.400]   but jump in anytime, Joey.
[02:11:15.400 --> 02:11:17.200]   Wow, what happened this weekend?
[02:11:17.200 --> 02:11:19.040]   Even the local news had to admit
[02:11:19.040 --> 02:11:21.040]   Antifa attack first, bottles.
[02:11:21.040 --> 02:11:22.280]   I mean, you were there,
[02:11:22.280 --> 02:11:23.740]   tell folks what happened.
[02:11:23.740 --> 02:11:25.940]   >> I want to thank you for
[02:11:25.940 --> 02:11:27.960]   having me on again.
[02:11:27.960 --> 02:11:29.960]   And I'm thankful for
[02:11:29.960 --> 02:11:33.560]   Joey to invite me to his event.
[02:11:33.560 --> 02:11:34.960]   It was absolutely crazy.
[02:11:34.960 --> 02:11:36.280]   We were completely peaceful.
[02:11:36.280 --> 02:11:38.520]   DHS did a beautiful job.
[02:11:38.520 --> 02:11:40.360]   They did an awesome job.
[02:11:40.360 --> 02:11:42.040]   They protected all of us.
[02:11:42.040 --> 02:11:43.600]   When we were going into the event,
[02:11:43.600 --> 02:11:44.680]   we had to, if anyone had
[02:11:44.680 --> 02:11:46.160]   defamates or anything like that,
[02:11:46.160 --> 02:11:47.620]   they had to give it to DHS.
[02:11:47.620 --> 02:11:49.080]   So we didn't have anything to
[02:11:49.080 --> 02:11:50.920]   protect ourselves from these Antifa
[02:11:50.920 --> 02:11:52.500]   domestic terrorist groups.
[02:11:52.500 --> 02:11:54.960]   But I want to, it was absolutely
[02:11:54.960 --> 02:11:57.120]   insane for what they were doing.
[02:11:57.120 --> 02:11:58.560]   It's just like Berkeley all
[02:11:58.560 --> 02:11:59.200]   over again.
[02:11:59.200 --> 02:11:59.960]   We go there,
[02:11:59.960 --> 02:12:01.680]   we're completely peaceful.
[02:12:01.680 --> 02:12:03.080]   We're Trump supporters,
[02:12:03.080 --> 02:12:04.600]   we're black, we're brown,
[02:12:04.600 --> 02:12:06.440]   we're white, we're all together.
[02:12:06.440 --> 02:12:07.560]   No one's fighting.
[02:12:07.560 --> 02:12:09.000]   It's only when we go out onto
[02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:10.520]   the streets where Antifa and
[02:12:10.520 --> 02:12:12.160]   the Portland police didn't do
[02:12:12.160 --> 02:12:13.480]   their jobs to protect us.
[02:12:14.360 --> 02:12:15.640]   >> Well, that's in the Soros
[02:12:15.640 --> 02:12:17.080]   documents that they work with
[02:12:17.080 --> 02:12:18.640]   Blue City Police to stand down,
[02:12:18.640 --> 02:12:20.360]   even let them engage in violence.
[02:12:20.360 --> 02:12:23.200]   Joey, tell us about your prayer
[02:12:23.200 --> 02:12:24.920]   group, the events you've had, and
[02:12:24.920 --> 02:12:26.560]   why you think Antifa particularly
[02:12:26.560 --> 02:12:27.400]   attacks these.
[02:12:27.400 --> 02:12:29.440]   >> Yeah, so basically, we started
[02:12:29.440 --> 02:12:31.320]   doing this because we saw people
[02:12:31.320 --> 02:12:33.120]   getting beat up in the streets
[02:12:33.120 --> 02:12:35.200]   during the Trump election down in
[02:12:35.200 --> 02:12:35.880]   San Jose.
[02:12:35.880 --> 02:12:37.400]   So the goal was to go out and
[02:12:37.400 --> 02:12:39.960]   just challenge it and expose them.
[02:12:39.960 --> 02:12:41.120]   But at the same time,
[02:12:41.120 --> 02:12:42.960]   our rhetoric has always been about
[02:12:42.960 --> 02:12:44.760]   love and prayer and talking about
[02:12:44.760 --> 02:12:46.560]   God, yet these people come out of
[02:12:46.560 --> 02:12:48.400]   nowhere and they hate the freedom
[02:12:48.400 --> 02:12:50.200]   aspect, okay, because a lot of
[02:12:50.200 --> 02:12:51.860]   them are communists.
[02:12:51.860 --> 02:12:53.480]   And they seem to just really hate
[02:12:53.480 --> 02:12:54.520]   the message of God,
[02:12:54.520 --> 02:12:55.560]   they despise it.
[02:12:55.560 --> 02:12:57.400]   And so they just come from all over
[02:12:57.400 --> 02:12:59.240]   the West Coast to whatever rally
[02:12:59.240 --> 02:13:01.360]   we're throwing, and they're going
[02:13:01.360 --> 02:13:03.280]   to use violence and do whatever it
[02:13:03.280 --> 02:13:04.560]   takes to silence us.
[02:13:04.560 --> 02:13:06.040]   >> What was the big takeaway from
[02:13:06.040 --> 02:13:07.680]   this latest one, A, and then B?
[02:13:07.680 --> 02:13:09.040]   It's here, they say revolution,
[02:13:09.040 --> 02:13:10.240]   they say they're going to launch
[02:13:10.240 --> 02:13:11.040]   the attacks.
[02:13:11.040 --> 02:13:12.000]   There's arrests all over
[02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:12.560]   the country.
[02:13:12.560 --> 02:13:13.400]   There's attacks happening
[02:13:13.400 --> 02:13:13.920]   everywhere.
[02:13:13.920 --> 02:13:14.640]   Behind the scenes,
[02:13:14.640 --> 02:13:15.600]   I can't get to it yet on air.
[02:13:15.600 --> 02:13:17.160]   They have launched attacks against
[02:13:17.160 --> 02:13:18.520]   me and my family that are out of
[02:13:18.520 --> 02:13:19.600]   a Twilight Zone movie.
[02:13:19.600 --> 02:13:21.520]   I mean, I'm talking basically like
[02:13:21.520 --> 02:13:23.120]   intelligence agencies, but
[02:13:23.120 --> 02:13:24.760]   it's the Democratic Party and
[02:13:24.760 --> 02:13:26.720]   Soros, he's put 18 billion in.
[02:13:26.720 --> 02:13:28.080]   I mean, the battle is really
[02:13:28.080 --> 02:13:28.760]   heating up.
[02:13:28.760 --> 02:13:31.760]   >> I would say there's two things
[02:13:31.760 --> 02:13:32.400]   to take from this.
[02:13:32.400 --> 02:13:34.640]   Number one, we're at a point now,
[02:13:34.640 --> 02:13:36.080]   it's unfortunate.
[02:13:36.080 --> 02:13:37.360]   I have a lot of respect for
[02:13:37.360 --> 02:13:38.920]   most of the police.
[02:13:38.920 --> 02:13:39.880]   I think most of the police
[02:13:39.880 --> 02:13:41.120]   officers, they want to do their
[02:13:41.120 --> 02:13:42.400]   job, but right now they're just
[02:13:42.400 --> 02:13:43.120]   sitting around,
[02:13:43.120 --> 02:13:44.480]   especially in Portland, Oregon.
[02:13:44.480 --> 02:13:45.560]   And so I kind of want to make
[02:13:45.560 --> 02:13:46.720]   a call for these guys to make
[02:13:46.720 --> 02:13:48.320]   a conscientious decision to protect
[02:13:48.320 --> 02:13:49.280]   the Constitution,
[02:13:49.280 --> 02:13:50.960]   which is the First Amendment.
[02:13:50.960 --> 02:13:52.440]   If you get an order from someone
[02:13:52.440 --> 02:13:54.040]   above you that's asking you to go
[02:13:54.040 --> 02:13:55.440]   against the Constitution,
[02:13:55.440 --> 02:13:57.080]   you need to do what is right.
[02:13:57.080 --> 02:13:58.600]   The second thing I'm going to take
[02:13:58.600 --> 02:13:59.880]   from this is if the police are
[02:13:59.880 --> 02:14:01.360]   going to stand down and we're not
[02:14:01.360 --> 02:14:02.640]   going to have law and order,
[02:14:02.640 --> 02:14:04.200]   you're going to have patriots from
[02:14:04.200 --> 02:14:05.600]   all over the country come in and
[02:14:05.600 --> 02:14:07.160]   they're going to do their job like
[02:14:07.160 --> 02:14:08.680]   you saw on Saturday because they
[02:14:08.680 --> 02:14:10.360]   had Antifa, they had sharp members
[02:14:10.360 --> 02:14:11.680]   running scared.
[02:14:11.680 --> 02:14:13.360]   And there's that viral video where
[02:14:13.360 --> 02:14:14.880]   that sharp member had a baton,
[02:14:14.880 --> 02:14:16.040]   went up against a guy,
[02:14:16.040 --> 02:14:17.560]   a proud boy who had nothing but
[02:14:17.560 --> 02:14:19.120]   his arm, blocked it twice,
[02:14:19.120 --> 02:14:20.520]   hit him with one punch and
[02:14:20.520 --> 02:14:21.880]   he was out, he was done.
[02:14:21.880 --> 02:14:23.800]   And so I think patriots will begin
[02:14:23.800 --> 02:14:25.360]   to stand up and take back the
[02:14:25.360 --> 02:14:26.000]   streets.
[02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:27.800]   >> And again, I've watched hours of
[02:14:27.800 --> 02:14:29.520]   the videos, how they would throw
[02:14:29.520 --> 02:14:31.200]   the bottles, they would attack
[02:14:31.200 --> 02:14:32.900]   first, the police stood down,
[02:14:32.900 --> 02:14:34.600]   you guys would kick their butt.
[02:14:34.600 --> 02:14:36.040]   Like Tommy Robinson fighting off
[02:14:36.040 --> 02:14:36.960]   nine guys himself,
[02:14:36.960 --> 02:14:38.360]   even though he's a little guy.
[02:14:38.360 --> 02:14:40.000]   Describe the essence of that, and
[02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:41.560]   the break of what happened.
[02:14:41.560 --> 02:14:46.240]   >> So yeah, it's like, okay,
[02:14:46.240 --> 02:14:47.760]   we'll talk about June 3rd,
[02:14:47.760 --> 02:14:48.560]   for example.
[02:14:48.560 --> 02:14:50.240]   So that was the first Portland
[02:14:50.240 --> 02:14:51.560]   rally a few weeks ago.
[02:14:51.560 --> 02:14:53.660]   You have these Antifa kids chasing
[02:14:53.660 --> 02:14:55.800]   after families, people who can't
[02:14:55.800 --> 02:14:57.480]   really defend themselves.
[02:14:57.480 --> 02:14:58.880]   You look at Haley Adams and
[02:14:58.880 --> 02:15:00.780]   her family, they attacked them,
[02:15:00.780 --> 02:15:02.780]   stole their property, beat them up
[02:15:02.780 --> 02:15:04.520]   because they saw them as an easy
[02:15:04.520 --> 02:15:05.120]   target.
[02:15:05.120 --> 02:15:06.960]   Same thing with an elder than man,
[02:15:06.960 --> 02:15:08.800]   Kerry Hudson, they went after them
[02:15:08.800 --> 02:15:10.080]   because they can't take on
[02:15:10.080 --> 02:15:11.500]   the real patriots willing to
[02:15:11.500 --> 02:15:12.620]   defend themselves.
[02:15:12.620 --> 02:15:14.000]   So June 30th comes along and
[02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:15.760]   there's all this rhetoric about how
[02:15:15.760 --> 02:15:17.160]   I'm not going to be able to show
[02:15:17.160 --> 02:15:18.840]   up because they're going to kill me,
[02:15:18.840 --> 02:15:20.080]   they're going to stab me.
[02:15:20.080 --> 02:15:21.500]   All this talk, they show up,
[02:15:21.500 --> 02:15:23.160]   they go running down the streets,
[02:15:23.160 --> 02:15:24.720]   and the patriots just chase them
[02:15:24.720 --> 02:15:25.720]   a whole block down.
[02:15:25.720 --> 02:15:26.920]   >> And we just showed dramatic
[02:15:26.920 --> 02:15:28.720]   footage, we'll come back with again,
[02:15:28.720 --> 02:15:29.520]   you were there.
[02:15:29.520 --> 02:15:31.160]   I mean, you've got a guy with one
[02:15:31.160 --> 02:15:32.860]   of those extendable metal clubs,
[02:15:32.860 --> 02:15:34.160]   you can kill somebody with
[02:15:34.160 --> 02:15:35.680]   a police baton, basically,
[02:15:35.680 --> 02:15:36.880]   an extendable baton.
[02:15:36.880 --> 02:15:39.200]   They can break your bones whipping
[02:15:39.200 --> 02:15:39.960]   it at you.
[02:15:39.960 --> 02:15:42.040]   And of course, they got fellow
[02:15:42.040 --> 02:15:43.680]   steps in and just boom,
[02:15:43.680 --> 02:15:45.720]   total KO, knockout, boom.
[02:15:45.720 --> 02:15:47.320]   And the woman tries to attack you,
[02:15:47.320 --> 02:15:49.040]   that's their thing, they try to get
[02:15:49.040 --> 02:15:50.120]   women to attack you.
[02:15:50.120 --> 02:15:51.160]   So you got to defend yourself and
[02:15:51.160 --> 02:15:52.240]   they go, you attacked a woman.
[02:15:52.240 --> 02:15:53.680]   Well, yeah, you just got in a man's
[02:15:53.680 --> 02:15:54.280]   world, lady.

[02:19:05.640 --> 02:19:07.640]   Several years ago, I set out with
[02:19:07.640 --> 02:19:10.040]   top formulators in the US to create
[02:19:10.040 --> 02:19:12.360]   the strongest, most concentrated,

[02:19:18.600 --> 02:19:20.600]   I know from using this myself
[02:19:20.600 --> 02:19:21.720]   the last few months and from
[02:19:21.720 --> 02:19:23.240]   seeing my friends and family use it
[02:19:23.240 --> 02:19:24.520]   that this new product is going to

[02:20:21.280 --> 02:20:24.000]   Cowards or Yellow Bellies.
[02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.720]   With all the videos we've got the
[02:20:26.720 --> 02:20:28.960]   last ten years of Antifa,
[02:20:28.960 --> 02:20:30.560]   beating up women,
[02:20:30.560 --> 02:20:32.560]   people in wheelchairs.
[02:20:32.560 --> 02:20:34.280]   They come out to Christian rallies
[02:20:34.280 --> 02:20:35.200]   and will run up and
[02:20:35.200 --> 02:20:36.960]   hit a woman in the back of the head.
[02:20:36.960 --> 02:20:39.240]   They are the archetypal weasel
[02:20:39.240 --> 02:20:39.840]   wimps.
[02:20:39.840 --> 02:20:41.560]   And then you look at the average
[02:20:41.560 --> 02:20:43.520]   Antifa, they're like a meth-head
[02:20:43.520 --> 02:20:45.400]   shriveled white kid or professor
[02:20:45.400 --> 02:20:47.240]   running around screaming about
[02:20:47.240 --> 02:20:49.240]   racist white people everywhere.
[02:20:49.240 --> 02:20:50.960]   They'll have the occasional mental
[02:20:50.960 --> 02:20:52.040]   patient or meth head.
[02:20:52.040 --> 02:20:53.760]   They show up with their clubs and
[02:20:53.760 --> 02:20:54.720]   their weapons.
[02:20:54.720 --> 02:20:56.240]   And then as soon as one of them
[02:20:56.240 --> 02:20:57.240]   gets knocked out,
[02:20:57.240 --> 02:20:58.600]   they always turn and run.
[02:20:58.600 --> 02:21:00.360]   And you'll see them target women
[02:21:00.360 --> 02:21:01.400]   with bike locks and
[02:21:01.400 --> 02:21:02.520]   a whole crowd do it.
[02:21:02.520 --> 02:21:03.440]   It's incredible.
[02:21:03.440 --> 02:21:04.720]   So we've got Will Johnson,
[02:21:04.720 --> 02:21:06.720]   who's with UnitedAmericanFirst.com,
[02:21:06.720 --> 02:21:08.120]   and Joey Gibson, who has these
[02:21:08.120 --> 02:21:09.720]   Christian prayer group rallies,
[02:21:09.720 --> 02:21:11.240]   where they're all inclusive and
[02:21:11.240 --> 02:21:12.680]   they're trying to have peace.
[02:21:12.680 --> 02:21:13.440]   And people come out and
[02:21:13.440 --> 02:21:14.480]   attack, as they said a few weeks
[02:21:14.480 --> 02:21:15.120]   ago in Portland,
[02:21:15.120 --> 02:21:16.080]   they attacked men, women,
[02:21:16.080 --> 02:21:16.640]   children.
[02:21:16.640 --> 02:21:17.720]   Hell, in Berkeley,
[02:21:17.720 --> 02:21:19.360]   they attacked Millie Weaver and
[02:21:19.360 --> 02:21:20.120]   her husband and
[02:21:20.120 --> 02:21:21.840]   baby and attacked their car.
[02:21:21.840 --> 02:21:22.880]   I've told Millie don't go out
[02:21:22.880 --> 02:21:23.720]   there without security,
[02:21:23.720 --> 02:21:24.400]   she still does.
[02:21:24.400 --> 02:21:25.680]   She's got a lot of courage.
[02:21:25.680 --> 02:21:27.040]   But the fact that you have to go
[02:21:27.040 --> 02:21:28.520]   out, these families try to go to
[02:21:28.520 --> 02:21:29.920]   Fourth of July parades.
[02:21:29.920 --> 02:21:31.280]   They just caught a guy trying to
[02:21:31.280 --> 02:21:32.400]   blow it up in Cleveland.
[02:21:32.400 --> 02:21:34.480]   They give toy cars with bombs in
[02:21:34.480 --> 02:21:34.980]   it.
[02:21:34.980 --> 02:21:37.280]   It's just the level of the hate and
[02:21:37.280 --> 02:21:39.080]   the insanity.
[02:21:39.080 --> 02:21:40.760]   And this guy they just arrested,
[02:21:40.760 --> 02:21:42.360]   document cam shot on this guy if
[02:21:42.360 --> 02:21:43.800]   we can, or maybe pull it up on
[02:21:43.800 --> 02:21:45.000]   Infowars.com.
[02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:46.280]   Man who threatened to murder
[02:21:46.280 --> 02:21:47.760]   Rand Paul's children is an Obama
[02:21:47.760 --> 02:21:49.320]   supporting Berkeley resident.
[02:21:49.320 --> 02:21:50.120]   And again,
[02:21:50.120 --> 02:21:52.840]   he's wearing women's glasses.
[02:21:52.840 --> 02:21:54.400]   He looks like he probably couldn't
[02:21:54.400 --> 02:21:55.640]   bench press 50 pounds, but
[02:21:55.640 --> 02:21:56.760]   he talks about I'm going to
[02:21:56.760 --> 02:21:58.200]   kidnap, I'm going to murder your
[02:21:58.200 --> 02:21:59.600]   children, I'm going to cut their
[02:21:59.600 --> 02:22:01.080]   guts out, then I'm going to murder
[02:22:01.080 --> 02:22:02.320]   you, he's facing ten years in
[02:22:02.320 --> 02:22:02.840]   prison.
[02:22:02.840 --> 02:22:03.880]   Turns out on his Twitter,
[02:22:03.880 --> 02:22:05.120]   I went and looked up his Twitter.
[02:22:05.120 --> 02:22:06.160]   He was in there for weeks
[02:22:06.160 --> 02:22:07.680]   threatening all the Republicans.
[02:22:07.680 --> 02:22:09.240]   He goes, look at my hit list.
[02:22:09.240 --> 02:22:10.880]   I've death threatened all these
[02:22:10.880 --> 02:22:11.400]   people.
[02:22:11.400 --> 02:22:14.800]   So finally, Rand Paul has been
[02:22:14.800 --> 02:22:16.680]   shot at with Scalise.
[02:22:16.680 --> 02:22:18.520]   He has been six of his ribs
[02:22:18.520 --> 02:22:20.600]   broken, a lung punctured.
[02:22:20.600 --> 02:22:22.600]   You know how painful that is for
[02:22:22.600 --> 02:22:23.100]   you?
[02:22:23.100 --> 02:22:24.160]   You've had ribs broken,
[02:22:24.160 --> 02:22:25.560]   I've had it, nothing like that,
[02:22:25.560 --> 02:22:26.800]   never had a lung punctured.
[02:22:26.800 --> 02:22:27.920]   That guy caved him in,
[02:22:27.920 --> 02:22:29.320]   attacked him, jumped up and
[02:22:29.320 --> 02:22:30.880]   down on him, trying to kill him.
[02:22:30.880 --> 02:22:32.400]   Okay, he's not even getting in
[02:22:32.400 --> 02:22:33.680]   hardly any trouble.
[02:22:33.680 --> 02:22:35.560]   And now this guy wants to kill him.
[02:22:35.560 --> 02:22:36.880]   And then Rand Paul's actually
[02:22:36.880 --> 02:22:38.200]   a libertarian anti-war guy,
[02:22:38.200 --> 02:22:39.200]   the left's so crazed,
[02:22:39.200 --> 02:22:40.720]   they don't even know who to hate.
[02:22:40.720 --> 02:22:42.840]   So it's unbelievable,
[02:22:42.840 --> 02:22:44.040]   ladies and gentlemen.
[02:22:44.040 --> 02:22:46.000]   So getting back to Joey Gibson,
[02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.200]   Joey, describe what it's like when
[02:22:48.200 --> 02:22:50.160]   these cowards come up with metal
[02:22:50.160 --> 02:22:52.400]   batons, really trying to kill you.
[02:22:52.400 --> 02:22:53.640]   And then folks are knocking them
[02:22:53.640 --> 02:22:54.560]   out with one punch, and
[02:22:54.560 --> 02:22:55.840]   then the rest of the cowards run.
[02:22:55.840 --> 02:22:56.720]   They're so tough,
[02:22:56.720 --> 02:22:57.880]   till one of them gets hit,
[02:22:57.880 --> 02:22:58.960]   they all turn and run.
[02:22:58.960 --> 02:23:00.080]   The definition of scum.
[02:23:00.080 --> 02:23:03.000]   >> Yeah, absolutely.
[02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:04.120]   And that's why it's really
[02:23:04.120 --> 02:23:05.200]   important that we unite,
[02:23:05.200 --> 02:23:05.920]   we come together.
[02:23:05.920 --> 02:23:07.360]   We come together in mass numbers
[02:23:07.360 --> 02:23:08.840]   and just have each other's backs.
[02:23:08.840 --> 02:23:10.320]   Because the only way they can
[02:23:10.320 --> 02:23:12.000]   really win is if we fall apart,
[02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:13.840]   we divide, we get people to go off
[02:23:13.840 --> 02:23:15.320]   on their own.
[02:23:15.320 --> 02:23:16.760]   And that's exactly what happened
[02:23:16.760 --> 02:23:17.960]   at Haley's Addams Family,
[02:23:17.960 --> 02:23:19.240]   which they had the courage to do
[02:23:19.240 --> 02:23:20.600]   it, but they crossed the street
[02:23:20.600 --> 02:23:21.400]   wearing MAGA hats.
[02:23:21.400 --> 02:23:22.880]   Which that's their right to do.
[02:23:22.880 --> 02:23:24.480]   They went across the street and
[02:23:24.480 --> 02:23:25.960]   they confronted Antifa and
[02:23:25.960 --> 02:23:27.720]   then they just started attacking
[02:23:27.720 --> 02:23:29.840]   her father, her mother, her sister.
[02:23:29.840 --> 02:23:31.020]   They held down Haley and
[02:23:31.020 --> 02:23:32.800]   stole their property right in front
[02:23:32.800 --> 02:23:33.600]   of the police.
[02:23:33.600 --> 02:23:34.680]   And so they'll do that,
[02:23:34.680 --> 02:23:35.840]   they'll act real tough.
[02:23:35.840 --> 02:23:37.280]   There's a lot of them who act tough,
[02:23:37.280 --> 02:23:38.400]   but the second they got to go
[02:23:38.400 --> 02:23:39.600]   toe to toe with any patriot,
[02:23:39.600 --> 02:23:40.760]   man, they start running.
[02:23:40.760 --> 02:23:43.400]   They get one punch and they're done.
[02:23:43.400 --> 02:23:44.800]   And so, unfortunately,
[02:23:44.800 --> 02:23:46.440]   the only thing they can do is try
[02:23:46.440 --> 02:23:47.480]   to find a victim,
[02:23:47.480 --> 02:23:49.760]   someone who can't defend themselves.
[02:23:49.760 --> 02:23:50.840]   >> Well, I know this.
[02:23:50.840 --> 02:23:54.720]   I've seen the videos of them coming
[02:23:54.720 --> 02:23:56.320]   up and attacking women in strollers
[02:23:56.320 --> 02:23:57.120]   and stuff.
[02:23:57.120 --> 02:23:58.240]   These women need to be packing,
[02:23:58.240 --> 02:23:58.760]   man.
[02:23:58.760 --> 02:23:59.840]   Thugs start assaulting women,
[02:23:59.840 --> 02:24:01.000]   they need to defend themselves.
[02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:03.840]   >> Yeah, absolutely.
[02:24:03.840 --> 02:24:04.480]   >> Will Johnson,
[02:24:04.480 --> 02:24:05.200]   what do you say to that?
[02:24:05.200 --> 02:24:08.920]   >> We shouldn't have to be afraid
[02:24:08.920 --> 02:24:10.800]   to go out as Americans.
[02:24:10.800 --> 02:24:12.360]   Every time we have a rally,
[02:24:12.360 --> 02:24:13.760]   a conservative rally,
[02:24:13.760 --> 02:24:14.960]   a Christian rally,
[02:24:14.960 --> 02:24:16.960]   a pro-Trump rally, every single
[02:24:16.960 --> 02:24:18.720]   time, nine times out of ten,
[02:24:18.720 --> 02:24:20.920]   we will get anti for BLM, BAM, and
[02:24:20.920 --> 02:24:23.120]   now the Brown Berets in California
[02:24:23.120 --> 02:24:25.120]   to be aggressive to us, to attack
[02:24:25.120 --> 02:24:26.920]   us simply because we respect
[02:24:26.920 --> 02:24:28.240]   the American flag.
[02:24:28.240 --> 02:24:30.720]   We'll stand to the national anthem.
[02:24:30.720 --> 02:24:32.720]   This fighting is all due to
[02:24:32.720 --> 02:24:34.480]   the Democrats.
[02:24:34.480 --> 02:24:36.520]   And I'm calling the Democrats
[02:24:36.520 --> 02:24:38.600]   domestic terrorists.
[02:24:38.600 --> 02:24:40.360]   They are 100% domestic terrorist
[02:24:40.360 --> 02:24:41.680]   group in the United States.
[02:24:41.680 --> 02:24:43.800]   You have Maxine Waters calling for
[02:24:43.800 --> 02:24:45.920]   violence towards conservatives,
[02:24:45.920 --> 02:24:47.440]   anyone who's on the Trump
[02:24:47.440 --> 02:24:48.520]   administration.
[02:24:48.520 --> 02:24:50.720]   Can you imagine had this happen if
[02:24:50.720 --> 02:24:52.240]   Obama was in office and
[02:24:52.240 --> 02:24:54.240]   you had a Republican do this,
[02:24:54.240 --> 02:24:56.240]   it would be a- >> If a Republican
[02:24:56.240 --> 02:24:58.440]   was saying rise up, surround them,
[02:24:58.440 --> 02:25:00.560]   beat people up, I'd say hell no.
[02:25:00.560 --> 02:25:01.800]   I mean, exactly,
[02:25:01.800 --> 02:25:03.920]   they call us Nazis.
[02:25:03.920 --> 02:25:05.200]   This is exactly how Hitler came to
[02:25:05.200 --> 02:25:06.480]   power with the brown shirts.
[02:25:06.480 --> 02:25:07.760]   They did this exact same thing.
[02:25:07.760 --> 02:25:10.040]   >> Yes, exactly.
[02:25:10.040 --> 02:25:11.480]   And we have to experience this
[02:25:11.480 --> 02:25:12.480]   every single time.
[02:25:12.480 --> 02:25:14.400]   We're 100% peaceful.
[02:25:14.400 --> 02:25:15.640]   We were at Joey's rally and
[02:25:15.640 --> 02:25:16.520]   100% peaceful,
[02:25:16.520 --> 02:25:17.680]   everyone getting along.
[02:25:17.680 --> 02:25:18.920]   It wasn't until we went out in
[02:25:18.920 --> 02:25:20.080]   the streets to where we had.
[02:25:20.080 --> 02:25:21.160]   >> Amazing, and
[02:25:21.160 --> 02:25:23.240]   cameras don't catch it all.
[02:25:23.240 --> 02:25:25.080]   But I mean, describe what it's
[02:25:25.080 --> 02:25:27.120]   like when these antifa come up and
[02:25:27.120 --> 02:25:28.960]   try to basically kill you with
[02:25:28.960 --> 02:25:30.000]   metal pipes and
[02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:31.840]   are swinging for the fences.
[02:25:31.840 --> 02:25:33.520]   And then one of them gets hit and
[02:25:33.520 --> 02:25:34.320]   they all run.
[02:25:34.320 --> 02:25:36.480]   I mean, what is that like?
[02:25:36.480 --> 02:25:37.760]   It looks very exhilarating when
[02:25:37.760 --> 02:25:38.400]   the guy just,
[02:25:38.400 --> 02:25:39.960]   I want to give that guy an award.
[02:25:39.960 --> 02:25:41.120]   Do we know who that guy is that
[02:25:41.120 --> 02:25:42.320]   just cold cocked that guy that
[02:25:42.320 --> 02:25:43.640]   tried to kill him with the club?
[02:25:43.640 --> 02:25:45.680]   I mean, that's the real deal right
[02:25:45.680 --> 02:25:46.200]   there.
[02:25:48.200 --> 02:25:50.040]   >> Yeah, it's Rufio.
[02:25:50.040 --> 02:25:51.000]   He's a proud boy.
[02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:52.480]   He's in Washington,
[02:25:52.480 --> 02:25:54.160]   up in the Seattle area.
[02:25:54.160 --> 02:25:54.960]   Real big dude,
[02:25:54.960 --> 02:25:56.200]   works out all the time and
[02:25:56.200 --> 02:25:57.200]   he has a big heart.
[02:25:57.200 --> 02:25:58.520]   He's a really good guy.
[02:25:58.520 --> 02:26:00.000]   And we appreciate him standing in
[02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:01.160]   there and sticking up for
[02:26:01.160 --> 02:26:02.720]   all the people who are marching,
[02:26:02.720 --> 02:26:04.080]   the women and the elderly and
[02:26:04.080 --> 02:26:05.720]   just standing up like a real man.
[02:26:05.720 --> 02:26:07.120]   That's the spirit that we got to
[02:26:07.120 --> 02:26:08.160]   have in this country.
[02:26:08.160 --> 02:26:09.360]   >> I agree.
[02:26:09.360 --> 02:26:10.720]   I want to get him on because let me
[02:26:10.720 --> 02:26:11.240]   say this.
[02:26:11.240 --> 02:26:12.960]   Notice it took one man to stand up
[02:26:12.960 --> 02:26:14.560]   to those thugs, they all ran.
[02:26:14.560 --> 02:26:15.800]   One man.
[02:26:15.800 --> 02:26:16.920]   They're all up there sticking
[02:26:16.920 --> 02:26:18.160]   their chest out with their clubs,
[02:26:18.160 --> 02:26:19.240]   with their maces, with their
[02:26:19.240 --> 02:26:19.760]   weapons.
[02:26:19.760 --> 02:26:20.920]   It took one guy to stand up and
[02:26:20.920 --> 02:26:22.120]   knock them upside the head and
[02:26:22.120 --> 02:26:22.760]   they all ran.
[02:26:22.760 --> 02:26:24.240]   I mean, isn't that archetypal?
[02:26:24.240 --> 02:26:27.840]   >> Yeah, absolutely.
[02:26:27.840 --> 02:26:29.480]   And it really represents,
[02:26:29.480 --> 02:26:31.480]   that's the true American spirit
[02:26:31.480 --> 02:26:32.960]   right there, right?
[02:26:32.960 --> 02:26:34.560]   It's about, it's no fear.
[02:26:34.560 --> 02:26:35.440]   It's just standing up for
[02:26:35.440 --> 02:26:36.480]   what you believe in.
[02:26:36.480 --> 02:26:37.760]   And that's what the whole rally was
[02:26:37.760 --> 02:26:38.600]   about at the Freedom and
[02:26:38.600 --> 02:26:39.240]   Courage rally.
[02:26:39.240 --> 02:26:41.240]   It's about, it takes courage to
[02:26:41.240 --> 02:26:43.000]   really stand up for freedom,
[02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:44.280]   to get freedom, and
[02:26:44.280 --> 02:26:45.680]   that's it right there.
[02:26:45.680 --> 02:26:46.800]   It represents it and
[02:26:46.800 --> 02:26:48.480]   to just see him stand up to him.
[02:26:48.480 --> 02:26:49.560]   And he had no hesitation and
[02:26:49.560 --> 02:26:50.440]   that's what I love and
[02:26:50.440 --> 02:26:51.640]   that's what I appreciate it.
[02:26:51.640 --> 02:26:53.280]   And it was completely justified,
[02:26:53.280 --> 02:26:54.480]   it's all self defense.
[02:26:54.480 --> 02:26:55.960]   And so he pretty much became
[02:26:55.960 --> 02:26:57.680]   a hero overnight.
[02:26:57.680 --> 02:26:58.560]   >> That's right. >> You should have
[02:26:58.560 --> 02:26:59.920]   seen him, he drove back with us to
[02:26:59.920 --> 02:27:00.600]   the bar.
[02:27:00.600 --> 02:27:01.600]   He walked up to the bar and
[02:27:01.600 --> 02:27:02.680]   the whole bar just started
[02:27:02.680 --> 02:27:04.000]   chanting his name because it was
[02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:04.960]   all over the country.
[02:27:04.960 --> 02:27:06.240]   >> And again, say his name again.
[02:27:06.240 --> 02:27:08.720]   >> His name's Rufio,
[02:27:08.720 --> 02:27:09.840]   Ethan Rufio.
[02:27:09.840 --> 02:27:11.400]   >> We need to get him on ASAP.
[02:27:11.400 --> 02:27:12.880]   And it's not because he attacked
[02:27:12.880 --> 02:27:14.480]   somebody, he showed up to five or
[02:27:14.480 --> 02:27:16.200]   six guys waving weapons at him.
[02:27:16.200 --> 02:27:17.680]   And then they all turned and ran.
[02:27:17.680 --> 02:27:18.600]   That's what it's all about.
[02:27:18.600 --> 02:27:20.280]   It's not striking first.
[02:27:20.280 --> 02:27:21.680]   And that's my big concern, guys.
[02:27:21.680 --> 02:27:23.320]   I'm worried they've been caught,
[02:27:23.320 --> 02:27:24.880]   obviously, trying to stage that
[02:27:24.880 --> 02:27:26.180]   whole clash with the police
[02:27:26.180 --> 02:27:27.680]   ordering the new right folks,
[02:27:27.680 --> 02:27:29.200]   that I don't agree with a lot of
[02:27:29.200 --> 02:27:30.280]   what they have to say,
[02:27:30.280 --> 02:27:31.760]   into the anti-fascist scum.
[02:27:31.760 --> 02:27:33.000]   And Trump was right to condemn
[02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:33.720]   both sides, but
[02:27:33.720 --> 02:27:34.920]   the police made them clash.
[02:27:34.920 --> 02:27:35.520]   It's come out,
[02:27:35.520 --> 02:27:36.840]   the police stood down.
[02:27:36.840 --> 02:27:38.200]   I'm concerned they're going to
[02:27:38.200 --> 02:27:39.120]   pull more of that and
[02:27:39.120 --> 02:27:40.720]   try to get a big race war going.
[02:27:40.720 --> 02:27:41.640]   What do you think, Will?
[02:27:43.080 --> 02:27:44.800]   >> Yeah, I completely agree with
[02:27:44.800 --> 02:27:45.160]   you.
[02:27:45.160 --> 02:27:46.860]   When we were walking down,
[02:27:46.860 --> 02:27:48.040]   Portland police,
[02:27:48.040 --> 02:27:49.800]   they actually saw Antifa and
[02:27:49.800 --> 02:27:51.400]   the America supporters,
[02:27:51.400 --> 02:27:53.400]   I like to call them, facing off.
[02:27:53.400 --> 02:27:55.520]   And they did nothing to prevent
[02:27:55.520 --> 02:27:57.360]   what took place.
[02:27:57.360 --> 02:27:59.440]   We are in a civil war.
[02:27:59.440 --> 02:28:00.840]   It's not a hot civil war, but
[02:28:00.840 --> 02:28:02.280]   the Democrats are pushing for
[02:28:02.280 --> 02:28:03.640]   a racial division.
[02:28:03.640 --> 02:28:05.360]   They're pushing for a racial war.
[02:28:05.360 --> 02:28:06.960]   And my main goal is to stop that,
[02:28:06.960 --> 02:28:08.560]   because we should not be fighting
[02:28:08.560 --> 02:28:09.800]   each other based on one's
[02:28:09.800 --> 02:28:10.880]   complexion.
[02:28:10.880 --> 02:28:12.400]   They are literally trying to
[02:28:12.400 --> 02:28:13.680]   destroy the United States.
[02:28:13.680 --> 02:28:14.720]   They're so bitter,
[02:28:14.720 --> 02:28:16.000]   they're so angry because
[02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:17.640]   Donald J Trump is the president.
[02:28:17.640 --> 02:28:19.040]   And every time we have these
[02:28:19.040 --> 02:28:21.120]   rallies, we have to be on the guard.
[02:28:21.120 --> 02:28:22.620]   People, women come out with
[02:28:22.620 --> 02:28:24.220]   helmets on, come out with full
[02:28:24.220 --> 02:28:26.140]   metal jacket gear on, because they
[02:28:26.140 --> 02:28:27.900]   wanted to avoid the violence with
[02:28:27.900 --> 02:28:29.700]   these Antifa domestic terrorists
[02:28:29.700 --> 02:28:31.300]   that's the foot soldiers for
[02:28:31.300 --> 02:28:33.300]   the Democratic Party.
[02:28:33.300 --> 02:28:34.320]   Every single time,
[02:28:34.320 --> 02:28:35.340]   every single day,
[02:28:35.340 --> 02:28:36.680]   we see this from the left.
[02:28:36.680 --> 02:28:37.960]   [MUSIC]
[02:28:37.960 --> 02:28:38.480]   >> That's right, and
[02:28:38.480 --> 02:28:39.200]   they're getting ready to launch
[02:28:39.200 --> 02:28:39.800]   their big attack.
[02:28:39.800 --> 02:28:41.320]   You can feel it, you can see it.
[02:28:41.320 --> 02:28:42.440]   One of our gentlemen's running for
[02:28:42.440 --> 02:28:43.520]   Senate, not just launching these
[02:28:43.520 --> 02:28:44.080]   prayer vigils.
[02:28:44.080 --> 02:28:45.160]   Our other friends going up and
[02:28:45.160 --> 02:28:46.280]   down the West Coast exposing
[02:28:46.280 --> 02:28:46.880]   all this.
[02:28:46.880 --> 02:28:48.640]   Your calls and more straight ahead.
[02:28:48.640 --> 02:28:49.480]   History's happening,
[02:28:49.480 --> 02:28:51.080]   the battle's happening now.
[02:28:51.080 --> 02:28:51.720]   Joey Gibson and
[02:28:51.720 --> 02:28:53.000]   Will Johnson straight ahead.

[02:32:15.080 --> 02:32:16.680]   And I thought it was pretty cool,
[02:32:16.680 --> 02:32:17.880]   and read all the books and
[02:32:17.880 --> 02:32:18.960]   seen all the DVDs, and

[02:32:42.800 --> 02:32:44.520]   God, the more you fear God, but
[02:32:44.520 --> 02:32:45.800]   the more you chase God.
[02:32:45.800 --> 02:32:47.560]   And I wanted to say that it's an

[02:34:24.700 --> 02:34:26.620]   anti-racist, and a guy named

[02:34:32.640 --> 02:34:33.600]   He was a leftist, but
[02:34:33.600 --> 02:34:35.160]   he was really an anti-racist.
[02:34:35.160 --> 02:34:36.680]   And when he was going to college
[02:34:36.680 --> 02:34:38.320]   up in Maine, he's an older guy,
[02:34:38.320 --> 02:34:39.720]   we should find Steve Mason's
[02:34:39.720 --> 02:34:41.200]   number, I got it somewhere,
[02:34:41.200 --> 02:34:42.080]   get him in here.
[02:34:42.080 --> 02:34:43.720]   And he was the preeminent expert,
[02:34:43.720 --> 02:34:44.800]   he had this show called
[02:34:44.800 --> 02:34:45.760]   Texas Frontline.
[02:34:45.760 --> 02:34:47.380]   He'd say, the communists are now
[02:34:47.380 --> 02:34:49.040]   called the anti-fascist group,
[02:34:49.040 --> 02:34:50.680]   blah, blah, blah, and I would go,
[02:34:50.680 --> 02:34:52.080]   those are the guys that always
[02:34:52.080 --> 02:34:53.640]   hit me in the back when I'm doing
[02:34:53.640 --> 02:34:55.140]   a rally for Second Amendment,
[02:34:55.140 --> 02:34:56.260]   he goes, yeah, yeah,
[02:34:56.260 --> 02:34:57.100]   those are them.
[02:34:57.100 --> 02:34:58.560]   And they're all professors, and
[02:34:58.560 --> 02:34:59.840]   boy, was he a trailblazer and
[02:34:59.840 --> 02:35:00.720]   right about this.
[02:35:00.720 --> 02:35:01.960]   And he predicted the whole
[02:35:01.960 --> 02:35:03.360]   communist underground being
[02:35:03.360 --> 02:35:05.040]   prepared, and for in the future,
[02:35:05.040 --> 02:35:06.700]   they were going to launch all this.
[02:35:06.700 --> 02:35:08.200]   And then they were going to kind of
[02:35:08.200 --> 02:35:09.800]   collapse the borders for the UN and
[02:35:09.800 --> 02:35:11.480]   the world population operation.
[02:35:11.480 --> 02:35:13.320]   And now the UN is saying,
[02:35:13.320 --> 02:35:15.720]   we're going to occupy the EU, and
[02:35:15.720 --> 02:35:18.240]   we're going to stop nation states,
[02:35:18.240 --> 02:35:20.760]   stopping tens of millions pouring
[02:35:20.760 --> 02:35:22.780]   in, and they had a plan under
[02:35:22.780 --> 02:35:24.760]   Hillary to bring the UN in,
[02:35:24.760 --> 02:35:27.360]   that's in the Associated Press.
[02:35:27.360 --> 02:35:29.240]   Giant thing they're launching,
[02:35:29.240 --> 02:35:31.280]   decades in the making, thank God,
[02:35:31.280 --> 02:35:33.120]   populism from South America to
[02:35:33.120 --> 02:35:34.760]   areas of Africa, to Asia,
[02:35:34.760 --> 02:35:36.580]   to strong in Eastern Europe,
[02:35:36.580 --> 02:35:37.680]   the Brexit, and
[02:35:37.680 --> 02:35:39.480]   out in the Atlantic Ocean.
[02:35:39.480 --> 02:35:41.720]   It's like humanity isn't getting
[02:35:41.720 --> 02:35:43.680]   coordinated, when the FBI's
[02:35:43.680 --> 02:35:45.880]   questioned hundreds of people now
[02:35:45.880 --> 02:35:47.740]   about me, they keep saying,
[02:35:47.740 --> 02:35:49.820]   how does Jones know what Trump's
[02:35:49.820 --> 02:35:50.740]   going to say?
[02:35:50.740 --> 02:35:52.100]   Is Jones talking to Trump every
[02:35:52.100 --> 02:35:53.440]   day, who's the mastermind?
[02:35:53.440 --> 02:35:54.720]   And they're really doing this,
[02:35:54.720 --> 02:35:55.840]   they don't get it, it's like
[02:35:55.840 --> 02:35:56.380]   a spirit.
[02:35:56.380 --> 02:35:57.640]   They've got their evil spirit,
[02:35:57.640 --> 02:35:58.540]   the mystery of evil,
[02:35:58.540 --> 02:35:59.560]   the Bible talks about.
[02:35:59.560 --> 02:36:00.840]   I remember reading this when I was
[02:36:00.840 --> 02:36:01.880]   a kid, and in Bible study,
[02:36:01.880 --> 02:36:03.120]   I thought really there's an evil
[02:36:03.120 --> 02:36:04.240]   thing that coordinates, and
[02:36:04.240 --> 02:36:05.360]   that's the mystery of evil,
[02:36:05.360 --> 02:36:06.580]   how it works, and then God's got
[02:36:06.580 --> 02:36:07.760]   his own Holy Spirit.
[02:36:07.760 --> 02:36:09.580]   But when you actually get to this
[02:36:09.580 --> 02:36:11.280]   level, it's like we're all
[02:36:11.280 --> 02:36:12.940]   coordinated, they're all
[02:36:12.940 --> 02:36:14.520]   coordinated, but they're
[02:36:14.520 --> 02:36:16.060]   coordinated digitally and
[02:36:16.060 --> 02:36:17.660]   with commands and orders and
[02:36:17.660 --> 02:36:19.500]   propaganda, and also a spirit of
[02:36:19.500 --> 02:36:21.420]   hate, but there's a real spirit.
[02:36:21.420 --> 02:36:22.620]   So since I know both of you guys
[02:36:22.620 --> 02:36:23.620]   are Christians, so am I,
[02:36:23.620 --> 02:36:24.620]   I'm not some guy up here on
[02:36:24.620 --> 02:36:25.900]   a high horse, I just love God and
[02:36:25.900 --> 02:36:27.860]   that's what gives me my strength.
[02:36:27.860 --> 02:36:28.980]   Joey, you're a Christian,
[02:36:28.980 --> 02:36:30.260]   what makes you, and we're going to
[02:36:30.260 --> 02:36:31.500]   go to calls with both you guys.
[02:36:31.500 --> 02:36:32.860]   What made you understand you had
[02:36:32.860 --> 02:36:33.420]   to do this?
[02:36:33.420 --> 02:36:35.060]   I mean, was it a knot in your chest
[02:36:35.060 --> 02:36:36.620]   like Will talked about, because
[02:36:36.620 --> 02:36:38.060]   that's what it is with me, and
[02:36:38.060 --> 02:36:39.580]   then almost like a burning up my
[02:36:39.580 --> 02:36:41.020]   spine, and then in my mind,
[02:36:41.020 --> 02:36:42.600]   it's in my gut starts here, and
[02:36:42.600 --> 02:36:43.800]   then it's like I got to do
[02:36:43.800 --> 02:36:44.460]   something.
[02:36:44.460 --> 02:36:45.980]   Because it's not like I got to go
[02:36:45.980 --> 02:36:47.100]   be a champion or hero,
[02:36:47.100 --> 02:36:48.620]   it's like evil's coming on me,
[02:36:48.620 --> 02:36:49.820]   I got to do something.
[02:36:49.820 --> 02:36:51.340]   And I've seen Will talk about that
[02:36:51.340 --> 02:36:52.820]   feeling, you know evil when you
[02:36:52.820 --> 02:36:54.060]   see it, because you speak to
[02:36:54.060 --> 02:36:55.460]   the spiritual element of this.
[02:36:56.340 --> 02:36:57.540]   >> Yeah, actually Alex,
[02:36:57.540 --> 02:36:59.140]   a big part of this story has to do
[02:36:59.140 --> 02:36:59.700]   with you.
[02:36:59.700 --> 02:37:01.340]   I've always been awake in terms of
[02:37:01.340 --> 02:37:03.580]   the corruption in our government.
[02:37:03.580 --> 02:37:04.980]   I've always been a libertarian
[02:37:04.980 --> 02:37:06.220]   constitutionalist, and
[02:37:06.220 --> 02:37:07.580]   I started to listen to you for
[02:37:07.580 --> 02:37:09.220]   a while, and I really watched a lot
[02:37:09.220 --> 02:37:10.020]   of your shows.
[02:37:10.020 --> 02:37:11.580]   The one thing you kept pushing is
[02:37:11.580 --> 02:37:13.220]   that you can't just listen to your
[02:37:13.220 --> 02:37:14.500]   show, you have to go out and
[02:37:14.500 --> 02:37:15.260]   participate.
[02:37:15.260 --> 02:37:16.420]   And you kept pushing that, and
[02:37:16.420 --> 02:37:17.860]   pushing that, and pushing that, and
[02:37:17.860 --> 02:37:18.820]   it really spoke to me.
[02:37:18.820 --> 02:37:20.380]   And what had happened is a bunch of
[02:37:20.380 --> 02:37:22.020]   people got beat up in San Jose when
[02:37:22.020 --> 02:37:23.780]   they're leaving a Trump rally, and
[02:37:23.780 --> 02:37:25.020]   at that point I was done.
[02:37:25.020 --> 02:37:26.460]   I was done sitting in my house,
[02:37:26.460 --> 02:37:27.940]   I didn't know what I was going to
[02:37:27.940 --> 02:37:29.500]   do, but I'm going to go out there
[02:37:29.500 --> 02:37:30.660]   and participate, and
[02:37:30.660 --> 02:37:32.460]   it was a spiritual journey for me.
[02:37:32.460 --> 02:37:33.940]   And the first thing I did is I
[02:37:33.940 --> 02:37:35.140]   booked my tickets and
[02:37:35.140 --> 02:37:36.980]   I went down to Cleveland to the RNC
[02:37:36.980 --> 02:37:38.220]   which you were at, and
[02:37:38.220 --> 02:37:39.380]   I went to your rally.
[02:37:39.380 --> 02:37:40.340]   I heard you speak,
[02:37:40.340 --> 02:37:41.380]   I shook your hand.
[02:37:41.380 --> 02:37:42.980]   And I came back home a completely
[02:37:42.980 --> 02:37:44.100]   different person and
[02:37:44.100 --> 02:37:45.700]   just completely committed to
[02:37:45.700 --> 02:37:47.460]   making change in this culture.
[02:37:47.460 --> 02:37:49.100]   The one thing I said in my speech
[02:37:49.100 --> 02:37:50.300]   is that if you see evil,
[02:37:50.300 --> 02:37:52.060]   clear as day, which I was seeing,
[02:37:52.060 --> 02:37:53.140]   and you do nothing and
[02:37:53.140 --> 02:37:54.940]   you say nothing, then you're just
[02:37:54.940 --> 02:37:55.980]   too much to blame.
[02:37:55.980 --> 02:37:57.780]   So I refused to stand down.
[02:37:57.780 --> 02:37:58.900]   That's pretty much it right there.
[02:37:58.900 --> 02:38:00.140]   >> That's beautiful.
[02:38:00.140 --> 02:38:01.540]   Tell us your story, Will.
[02:38:01.540 --> 02:38:04.580]   >> I truly believe we're in
[02:38:04.580 --> 02:38:05.460]   a civil war.
[02:38:05.460 --> 02:38:07.820]   And I have to admit to something,
[02:38:07.820 --> 02:38:09.980]   brain force actually works for
[02:38:09.980 --> 02:38:11.980]   people who don't realize,
[02:38:11.980 --> 02:38:13.980]   I mean, it actually works.
[02:38:13.980 --> 02:38:15.660]   So when I would go to these rallies,
[02:38:15.660 --> 02:38:17.020]   I would pop to brain force and
[02:38:17.020 --> 02:38:18.620]   I was just right on it every single
[02:38:18.620 --> 02:38:19.980]   time, knocking them out.
[02:38:19.980 --> 02:38:21.980]   The liberals are confronting them,
[02:38:21.980 --> 02:38:23.940]   the brain force absolutely works.
[02:38:23.940 --> 02:38:25.340]   And I can say it firsthand.
[02:38:25.340 --> 02:38:28.380]   But this spiritual war that we're
[02:38:28.380 --> 02:38:29.820]   in, it is a battle.
[02:38:29.820 --> 02:38:31.060]   And just like Joey said,
[02:38:31.060 --> 02:38:32.340]   I used to listen to you.
[02:38:32.340 --> 02:38:33.260]   You said, people,
[02:38:33.260 --> 02:38:34.420]   you've got to speak up.
[02:38:34.420 --> 02:38:35.900]   You've got to do your own video,
[02:38:35.900 --> 02:38:37.380]   do your own podcast, do those,
[02:38:37.380 --> 02:38:37.940]   do those.
[02:38:37.940 --> 02:38:39.580]   And that not, because you were
[02:38:39.580 --> 02:38:41.300]   doing that, and I actually just
[02:38:41.300 --> 02:38:42.700]   got bigger in my chest and
[02:38:42.700 --> 02:38:44.540]   I had to speak out.
[02:38:44.540 --> 02:38:46.540]   So I'm in complete agreement with
[02:38:46.540 --> 02:38:48.220]   Joey and what you just said.
[02:38:48.220 --> 02:38:49.500]   >> And the reason we tell those
[02:38:49.500 --> 02:38:51.100]   stories is that's all happened to
[02:38:51.100 --> 02:38:52.340]   us at one time or another.
[02:38:52.340 --> 02:38:53.900]   And then you guys inspire me,
[02:38:53.900 --> 02:38:54.740]   I inspire you,
[02:38:54.740 --> 02:38:56.180]   we all inspire each other.
[02:38:56.180 --> 02:38:57.240]   And then we show,
[02:38:57.240 --> 02:38:58.660]   when we had the rally,
[02:38:58.660 --> 02:39:00.260]   our rally at Cleveland,
[02:39:00.260 --> 02:39:02.300]   I was so proud that more than half
[02:39:02.300 --> 02:39:04.060]   that crowd wasn't white.
[02:39:04.060 --> 02:39:05.300]   And that everybody loved each
[02:39:05.300 --> 02:39:06.900]   other, everybody was hugging.
[02:39:06.900 --> 02:39:08.740]   There were Hispanic, black folks,
[02:39:08.740 --> 02:39:10.660]   Asians, white guys, white bikers,
[02:39:10.660 --> 02:39:12.460]   guys with their Iron Cross tattoos
[02:39:12.460 --> 02:39:14.460]   on their arms, hugging black folks.
[02:39:14.460 --> 02:39:16.500]   And I see Trump and the Tea Party
[02:39:16.500 --> 02:39:17.940]   and all this healing.
[02:39:17.940 --> 02:39:19.980]   It's actually the most loving place
[02:39:19.980 --> 02:39:21.860]   you can go to a Tea Party event or
[02:39:21.860 --> 02:39:22.820]   a Trump event.
[02:39:22.820 --> 02:39:23.940]   That is the most open,
[02:39:23.940 --> 02:39:25.460]   people have light in their eyes,
[02:39:25.460 --> 02:39:26.220]   they're good.
[02:39:26.220 --> 02:39:27.820]   You go to a leftist event, again,
[02:39:27.820 --> 02:39:29.180]   I'm not putting them down,
[02:39:29.180 --> 02:39:30.760]   they look like somebody sucked
[02:39:30.760 --> 02:39:31.420]   their soul.
[02:39:31.420 --> 02:39:33.540]   This is spiritual is what I'm
[02:39:33.540 --> 02:39:34.260]   saying.
[02:39:34.260 --> 02:39:35.600]   >> Exactly, when I went to
[02:39:35.600 --> 02:39:37.000]   the Kevin De Leon, and
[02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:38.820]   I confronted him about why is he
[02:39:38.820 --> 02:39:40.260]   putting illegals before
[02:39:40.260 --> 02:39:41.620]   the American people.
[02:39:41.620 --> 02:39:43.140]   I was the only black male in
[02:39:43.140 --> 02:39:43.980]   the room, and
[02:39:43.980 --> 02:39:45.740]   then they all look demonic.
[02:39:45.740 --> 02:39:47.620]   And they all started attacking me,
[02:39:47.620 --> 02:39:49.260]   they were yelling at me saying
[02:39:49.260 --> 02:39:50.180]   it's not true.
[02:39:50.180 --> 02:39:51.940]   And it is absolutely true that he's
[02:39:51.940 --> 02:39:53.200]   putting the illegals before
[02:39:53.200 --> 02:39:54.360]   the American citizen.
[02:39:54.360 --> 02:39:55.940]   That's why we're in a predicament
[02:39:55.940 --> 02:39:57.200]   that we're in right now with
[02:39:57.200 --> 02:39:57.860]   the borders and
[02:39:57.860 --> 02:39:59.360]   with the immigration situation.
[02:39:59.360 --> 02:40:01.580]   This war that we're in is not just
[02:40:01.580 --> 02:40:03.980]   about left and right, Democrats and
[02:40:03.980 --> 02:40:06.460]   Republicans, it is a spiritual war.
[02:40:06.460 --> 02:40:08.660]   And they're trying to bring this
[02:40:08.660 --> 02:40:10.860]   war that we're having to a hot war
[02:40:10.860 --> 02:40:11.740]   in America.
[02:40:11.740 --> 02:40:12.940]   And I truly believe,
[02:40:12.940 --> 02:40:14.580]   like I said before, we are in
[02:40:14.580 --> 02:40:16.660]   the second civil war in this nation.
[02:40:16.660 --> 02:40:18.180]   >> I agree, you've been saying that
[02:40:18.180 --> 02:40:19.500]   for a year that I've seen your
[02:40:19.500 --> 02:40:20.020]   videos.
[02:40:20.020 --> 02:40:21.180]   And as we cross over,
[02:40:21.180 --> 02:40:22.680]   I think they're trying to go hot
[02:40:22.680 --> 02:40:23.380]   right now, but
[02:40:23.380 --> 02:40:24.800]   none of them want to get the full
[02:40:24.800 --> 02:40:25.300]   blame.
[02:40:25.300 --> 02:40:26.640]   Moore's willing to say it,
[02:40:26.640 --> 02:40:28.300]   Maxine, and the way I respect them
[02:40:28.300 --> 02:40:29.780]   is they're willing to say it.
[02:40:29.780 --> 02:40:31.860]   But I see them launching it right
[02:40:31.860 --> 02:40:34.020]   now, the numbers are pouring in,
[02:40:34.020 --> 02:40:36.300]   the attacks are all over the place.
[02:40:36.300 --> 02:40:37.780]   >> Yes, they are.
[02:40:37.780 --> 02:40:40.220]   I mean, Maxine Waters gave the okay
[02:40:40.220 --> 02:40:41.980]   to Antifa, BAM, BLM, and
[02:40:41.980 --> 02:40:44.140]   the Brown Berets, or anybody who
[02:40:44.140 --> 02:40:46.080]   doesn't agree with the Trump
[02:40:46.080 --> 02:40:48.000]   administration to go out and
[02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:50.300]   attack them, to approach them.
[02:40:50.300 --> 02:40:51.860]   When they're simply having dinner
[02:40:51.860 --> 02:40:52.860]   with their families,
[02:40:52.860 --> 02:40:54.240]   they're saying heckle them,
[02:40:54.240 --> 02:40:55.640]   be aggressive towards them,
[02:40:55.640 --> 02:40:57.020]   attack them where they are.
[02:40:57.020 --> 02:40:58.780]   It sounds to me like the Islamic
[02:40:58.780 --> 02:41:00.700]   terrorists, attack the infidels
[02:41:00.700 --> 02:41:01.620]   where they are.
[02:41:01.620 --> 02:41:03.580]   >> That's right, and MSNBC has
[02:41:03.580 --> 02:41:05.820]   a host I played earlier saying,
[02:41:05.820 --> 02:41:08.340]   Sarah Sanders gets a life sentence,
[02:41:08.340 --> 02:41:09.940]   she's not allowed to be
[02:41:09.940 --> 02:41:11.660]   comfortable anywhere,
[02:41:11.660 --> 02:41:13.580]   chase her down everywhere.
[02:41:13.580 --> 02:41:15.860]   That is so Brownshire.
[02:41:15.860 --> 02:41:17.220]   >> It is 100%.
[02:41:17.220 --> 02:41:19.620]   They complain and say that Trump
[02:41:19.620 --> 02:41:21.780]   is the neo-Nazi supporter,
[02:41:21.780 --> 02:41:24.220]   that he's a white supremacist.
[02:41:24.220 --> 02:41:26.540]   Both Joey and I were called white
[02:41:26.540 --> 02:41:28.860]   supremacists by Nancy Pelosi.
[02:41:28.860 --> 02:41:30.660]   Everything that they do,
[02:41:30.660 --> 02:41:32.900]   that they say they're against,
[02:41:32.900 --> 02:41:35.020]   that's exactly what they do.
[02:41:35.020 --> 02:41:37.100]   It's unbelievable.
[02:41:37.100 --> 02:41:40.140]   >> I can feel the energy.
[02:41:40.140 --> 02:41:41.180]   I mean, they're losing, but
[02:41:41.180 --> 02:41:42.100]   they're freaking out.
[02:41:42.100 --> 02:41:43.180]   I think the next few weeks,
[02:41:43.180 --> 02:41:44.260]   I think we're going to see some
[02:41:44.260 --> 02:41:44.940]   real violence.
[02:41:44.940 --> 02:41:47.900]   >> I agree, you know what?
[02:41:47.900 --> 02:41:48.900]   That's why I'm constantly
[02:41:48.900 --> 02:41:51.340]   screaming, we have to vote them
[02:41:51.340 --> 02:41:52.940]   out, because if we don't vote them
[02:41:52.940 --> 02:41:55.060]   out in 2018, we all lose.
[02:41:55.060 --> 02:41:56.060]   It doesn't matter if you're a
[02:41:56.060 --> 02:41:56.980]   Republican, Democrat, or- >> And
[02:41:56.980 --> 02:41:57.900]   Will, you made a great point.
[02:41:57.900 --> 02:41:59.420]   They've proven they're a criminal,
[02:41:59.420 --> 02:42:00.020]   globalist,
[02:42:00.020 --> 02:42:01.500]   CHICOM-funded organization that
[02:42:01.500 --> 02:42:02.820]   wants to overthrow the country.
[02:42:02.820 --> 02:42:03.620]   We have to get rid of the
[02:42:03.620 --> 02:42:04.380]   Democratic Party and
[02:42:04.380 --> 02:42:05.140]   create a new party.
[02:42:05.140 --> 02:42:07.460]   >> Absolutely, the Democratic
[02:42:07.460 --> 02:42:08.780]   Party is a domestic terrorist
[02:42:08.780 --> 02:42:09.300]   group.
[02:42:09.300 --> 02:42:11.380]   They're promoting violence,
[02:42:11.380 --> 02:42:12.340]   100%.
[02:42:12.340 --> 02:42:14.500]   Their foot soldiers is Antifa,
[02:42:14.500 --> 02:42:16.820]   BLM, BAM, and the Brown Berets,
[02:42:16.820 --> 02:42:17.420]   100%.
[02:42:18.860 --> 02:42:20.420]   >> Wow, Joey, we're going to break,
[02:42:20.420 --> 02:42:21.500]   you want to say something?
[02:42:21.500 --> 02:42:22.980]   >> Yeah, something real quick,
[02:42:22.980 --> 02:42:24.500]   just I know we don't have much
[02:42:24.500 --> 02:42:26.260]   time, but we got to break through
[02:42:26.260 --> 02:42:28.020]   the lies, this attempt to make us
[02:42:28.020 --> 02:42:29.220]   think that there's not
[02:42:29.220 --> 02:42:30.580]   conservatives out there,
[02:42:30.580 --> 02:42:32.100]   there's not this huge shit.
[02:42:32.100 --> 02:42:33.300]   One thing we can do is show up in
[02:42:33.300 --> 02:42:33.900]   the streets.
[02:42:33.900 --> 02:42:35.540]   August 4th, we're going back into
[02:42:35.540 --> 02:42:37.100]   Portland, and the safest thing we
[02:42:37.100 --> 02:42:38.580]   can do is to just bring thousands
[02:42:38.580 --> 02:42:39.180]   of people.
[02:42:39.180 --> 02:42:40.220]   >> I agree, August 4th,
[02:42:40.220 --> 02:42:41.620]   we're going to send reporters,
[02:42:41.620 --> 02:42:42.740]   hell, I might even come.
[02:42:42.740 --> 02:42:44.100]   They've just got me pinned down
[02:42:44.100 --> 02:42:45.380]   here with stuff you wouldn't
[02:42:45.380 --> 02:42:46.140]   believe there.
[02:42:46.140 --> 02:42:47.100]   I'm not complaining,
[02:42:47.100 --> 02:42:48.260]   I expected this to happen.
[02:42:48.260 --> 02:42:49.740]   God, these people are dirty.
[02:42:49.740 --> 02:42:51.380]   They are just, they are on my butt.
[02:42:51.380 --> 02:42:52.020]   Let me tell you,
[02:42:52.020 --> 02:42:53.320]   they're going after everybody in
[02:42:53.320 --> 02:42:54.420]   my family, we'll be back.
[02:42:54.420 --> 02:42:56.340]   We've taken thousands of years of
[02:42:56.340 --> 02:42:58.260]   known research and put it together
[02:42:58.260 --> 02:43:00.140]   with our own four years of seeking
[02:43:00.140 --> 02:43:01.980]   and testing to find the very best
[02:43:01.980 --> 02:43:03.740]   systems that God gave us through
[02:43:03.740 --> 02:43:05.860]   Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[02:43:05.860 --> 02:43:07.420]   That's why I'm introducing
[02:43:07.420 --> 02:43:08.940]   Z-Shield, toxic metal and
[02:43:08.940 --> 02:43:10.740]   chemical defense support.
[02:43:10.740 --> 02:43:12.220]   It's made in the USA.
[02:43:12.220 --> 02:43:13.980]   It's filled with known compounds
[02:43:13.980 --> 02:43:15.700]   from nature that are absolutely
[02:43:15.700 --> 02:43:17.260]   associated with detoxifying
[02:43:17.260 --> 02:43:18.940]   the body and it supports the info
[02:43:18.940 --> 02:43:21.140]   war. It is a classical 360 win.
[02:43:21.140 --> 02:43:22.500]   This is the formula that I
[02:43:22.500 --> 02:43:24.220]   personally have been taking for
[02:43:24.220 --> 02:43:24.900]   over a year.
[02:43:24.900 --> 02:43:26.700]   And now we believe we have come as
[02:43:26.700 --> 02:43:28.540]   close to perfection when it comes
[02:43:28.540 --> 02:43:30.460]   to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[02:43:30.460 --> 02:43:30.960]   get.
[02:43:30.960 --> 02:43:32.220]   You owe it to yourself,
[02:43:32.220 --> 02:43:33.780]   you owe it to your family, and
[02:43:33.780 --> 02:43:35.340]   you owe it to the future of this
[02:43:35.340 --> 02:43:37.220]   country and the world that patriots
[02:43:37.220 --> 02:43:38.860]   stay as healthy and as clean and
[02:43:38.860 --> 02:43:40.220]   as focused as you can be.
[02:43:40.220 --> 02:43:41.500]   Because we need you,
[02:43:41.500 --> 02:43:43.060]   the remnant of America,
[02:43:43.060 --> 02:43:44.980]   to reignite those brush fires to
[02:43:44.980 --> 02:43:46.860]   the next level and to be healthy
[02:43:46.860 --> 02:43:48.540]   and as focused as you can be.
[02:43:48.540 --> 02:43:49.900]   Thanks to your support and
[02:43:49.900 --> 02:43:51.100]   your prayers together,
[02:43:51.100 --> 02:43:52.540]   we're changing the world.
[02:43:52.540 --> 02:43:54.220]   Now it's time to change our bodies
[02:43:54.220 --> 02:43:55.060]   with Z-Shield and
[02:43:55.060 --> 02:43:56.140]   infowarslife.com.
[02:43:56.140 --> 02:43:57.580]   >> Living in volcano may sound
[02:43:57.580 --> 02:43:59.180]   more dramatic than it really is.
[02:43:59.180 --> 02:44:00.860]   The real drama can be found here
[02:44:00.860 --> 02:44:02.460]   in Leilani Estates.
[02:44:02.460 --> 02:44:04.180]   But a lot of us on the big island
[02:44:04.180 --> 02:44:06.060]   rely on rainwater, and we need to
[02:44:06.060 --> 02:44:07.540]   be concerned about ash and
[02:44:07.540 --> 02:44:08.700]   acid rain.
[02:44:08.700 --> 02:44:10.580]   Volcanic ash may contain heavy
[02:44:10.580 --> 02:44:12.540]   metal particles, and acid rain
[02:44:12.540 --> 02:44:14.500]   could lower the pH of the water to
[02:44:14.500 --> 02:44:16.020]   unhealthy levels.
[02:44:16.020 --> 02:44:18.380]   To find out, we employed a series
[02:44:18.380 --> 02:44:20.420]   of tests for heavy metals,
[02:44:20.420 --> 02:44:22.500]   alkalinity, and pH.
[02:44:22.500 --> 02:44:24.220]   What we learned was that there was
[02:44:24.220 --> 02:44:25.900]   in fact unhealthy levels of heavy
[02:44:25.900 --> 02:44:28.180]   metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[02:44:28.180 --> 02:44:30.180]   Next, we tested the water from our
[02:44:30.180 --> 02:44:32.100]   AlexaPure gravity filter.
[02:44:32.100 --> 02:44:33.900]   And not only were the heavy metal
[02:44:33.900 --> 02:44:35.780]   levels within safe measure, but
[02:44:35.780 --> 02:44:37.820]   the pH was also restored to optimal
[02:44:37.820 --> 02:44:39.260]   levels.
[02:44:39.260 --> 02:44:40.420]   As it turns out,
[02:44:40.420 --> 02:44:42.660]   the filter on the AlexaPure raises
[02:44:42.660 --> 02:44:44.580]   the pH of the water.
[02:44:44.580 --> 02:44:46.300]   So what we've learned is that
[02:44:46.300 --> 02:44:48.060]   volcanic ash and acid rain can
[02:44:48.060 --> 02:44:50.060]   contaminate a rainwater supply.
[02:44:50.060 --> 02:44:51.460]   But more importantly,
[02:44:51.460 --> 02:44:53.420]   a good water filtration system will
[02:44:53.420 --> 02:44:54.180]   purify it.
[02:44:54.180 --> 02:44:58.460]   >> This 4th of July is special.
[02:44:58.460 --> 02:44:59.380]   Everybody can see it,
[02:44:59.380 --> 02:45:00.420]   they can feel it.
[02:45:00.420 --> 02:45:02.140]   The globalists are attempting to
[02:45:02.140 --> 02:45:04.020]   kill a worldwide awakening to their
[02:45:04.020 --> 02:45:04.900]   tyranny.
[02:45:04.900 --> 02:45:06.180]   And America, yet again,
[02:45:06.180 --> 02:45:07.820]   is at the heart of the resistance,
[02:45:07.820 --> 02:45:08.660]   the globalists.
[02:45:08.660 --> 02:45:10.580]   That's why this 4th of July,
[02:45:10.580 --> 02:45:11.780]   I'm asking all of our great
[02:45:11.780 --> 02:45:12.900]   supporters to think about
[02:45:12.900 --> 02:45:14.180]   Infowars now more than ever.
[02:45:14.180 --> 02:45:15.780]   And what would the world be like if
[02:45:15.780 --> 02:45:17.340]   Infowars wasn't there resisting
[02:45:17.340 --> 02:45:18.220]   the globalists?
[02:45:18.220 --> 02:45:19.540]   What would have happened if you
[02:45:19.540 --> 02:45:21.260]   hadn't supported Infowars?
[02:45:21.260 --> 02:45:22.620]   We would not be having the victories
[02:45:22.620 --> 02:45:23.180]   we have today.
[02:45:23.180 --> 02:45:24.540]   So yes, a lot of good things are
[02:45:24.540 --> 02:45:25.220]   happening, but
[02:45:25.220 --> 02:45:26.380]   the enemy is striking back.
[02:45:26.380 --> 02:45:28.180]   So please, think about Infowars and
[02:45:28.180 --> 02:45:29.940]   funding our operation while you get
[02:45:29.940 --> 02:45:31.540]   great products at the same time on

[02:47:11.940 --> 02:47:23.220]   >> I've got a big announcement here,
[02:47:23.220 --> 02:47:24.340]   ladies and gentlemen.
[02:47:24.340 --> 02:47:25.940]   I'm very, very excited about it.
[02:47:25.940 --> 02:47:29.380]   You saw Dan Rather come out and
[02:47:29.380 --> 02:47:33.300]   demonize me and attack what we're
[02:47:33.300 --> 02:47:35.700]   doing here at Infowars and
[02:47:35.700 --> 02:47:36.580]   call us fake news.
[02:47:36.580 --> 02:47:37.980]   But he's the fake news.
[02:47:37.980 --> 02:47:40.340]   And he also recently came out and
[02:47:40.340 --> 02:47:42.420]   said that Trump is mean like
[02:47:42.420 --> 02:47:43.940]   a wolverine.
[02:47:43.940 --> 02:47:46.580]   So earlier this week I said, hey,
[02:47:46.580 --> 02:47:49.260]   let's put out Trump as a wolverine,
[02:47:49.260 --> 02:47:51.060]   mean like a wolverine,
[02:47:51.060 --> 02:47:52.860]   Infowars.com.
[02:47:52.860 --> 02:47:54.660]   Beautiful new red shirt,
[02:47:54.660 --> 02:47:57.020]   incredible job with the graphics
[02:47:57.020 --> 02:47:58.860]   crew, they are amazing.
[02:47:58.860 --> 02:48:01.060]   1995, high quality shirt,
[02:48:01.060 --> 02:48:03.500]   it's being printed right now.
[02:48:03.500 --> 02:48:05.460]   They'll be shipping out next week.
[02:48:05.460 --> 02:48:06.460]   Get your order in,
[02:48:06.460 --> 02:48:07.900]   this is a limited edition.
[02:48:07.900 --> 02:48:09.860]   This needs to be the new viral
[02:48:09.860 --> 02:48:10.660]   shirt.
[02:48:10.660 --> 02:48:12.860]   Now, I think on another idea today,
[02:48:12.860 --> 02:48:14.820]   we've got printing right here in
[02:48:14.820 --> 02:48:16.620]   Texas now, so we can get this by
[02:48:16.620 --> 02:48:17.740]   next week as well.
[02:48:17.740 --> 02:48:19.780]   I just put in a giant order,
[02:48:19.780 --> 02:48:21.860]   because I saw Walmart boycott
[02:48:21.860 --> 02:48:24.540]   launched over Impeach 45 clothing.
[02:48:24.540 --> 02:48:27.060]   Don't boycott Walmart over that,
[02:48:27.060 --> 02:48:28.460]   just say Walmart.
[02:48:28.460 --> 02:48:30.500]   I don't care if they copy our
[02:48:30.500 --> 02:48:32.860]   shirt, put out a reelect 45.
[02:48:32.860 --> 02:48:37.020]   Let's engage in that.
[02:48:37.020 --> 02:48:39.300]   So they've got their Impeach 45,
[02:48:39.300 --> 02:48:41.020]   you go to Infowars.com.
[02:48:41.020 --> 02:48:43.540]   We have reelect 45 with an American
[02:48:43.540 --> 02:48:45.980]   flag, very triggering on the right
[02:48:45.980 --> 02:48:48.620]   arm and on the back, Infowars.com.
[02:48:48.620 --> 02:48:52.220]   I am the resistance.
[02:48:52.220 --> 02:48:55.700]   I am the resistance.
[02:48:55.700 --> 02:48:57.580]   I mean, these shirts have just been
[02:48:57.580 --> 02:48:58.540]   a nightmare for me and
[02:48:58.540 --> 02:48:59.900]   I knew Hillary for prison.
[02:48:59.900 --> 02:49:02.620]   I saw a handmade sign in a yard
[02:49:02.620 --> 02:49:05.380]   about three years before the
[02:49:05.380 --> 02:49:08.580]   election, they knew she'd run.
[02:49:08.580 --> 02:49:09.860]   And then I remember thinking, or
[02:49:09.860 --> 02:49:10.620]   two years before,
[02:49:10.620 --> 02:49:11.860]   I thought we've got to do that.
[02:49:11.860 --> 02:49:13.260]   And we went to the RNC, and
[02:49:13.260 --> 02:49:15.020]   a third of the people were wearing
[02:49:15.020 --> 02:49:16.340]   it, it was the chance.
[02:49:16.340 --> 02:49:18.980]   We had planes flying around saying
[02:49:18.980 --> 02:49:20.820]   it, behind them, it was incredible,
[02:49:20.820 --> 02:49:21.980]   it was a magic moment.
[02:49:21.980 --> 02:49:23.540]   And I know when something's going
[02:49:23.540 --> 02:49:24.140]   to be a hit.
[02:49:24.140 --> 02:49:26.180]   So they've got their Impeach 45,
[02:49:26.180 --> 02:49:28.420]   reelect 45, baseball shirt style,
[02:49:28.420 --> 02:49:30.580]   white, blue, and red, red, white,
[02:49:30.580 --> 02:49:32.580]   and blue, and then black on white,
[02:49:32.580 --> 02:49:33.820]   I am the resistance.
[02:49:33.820 --> 02:49:36.500]   It's an awesome shirt, 1995,
[02:49:36.500 --> 02:49:38.460]   high quality fabric made right here
[02:49:38.460 --> 02:49:40.380]   in America, printed in America.
[02:49:40.380 --> 02:49:42.180]   So it's costing six, seven bucks to
[02:49:42.180 --> 02:49:43.220]   do that in America,
[02:49:43.220 --> 02:49:44.820]   we do it for three bucks in Mexico.
[02:49:44.820 --> 02:49:45.660]   So it's there,
[02:49:45.660 --> 02:49:47.020]   help fund the operation.
[02:49:47.020 --> 02:49:49.940]   Reelect 45, Infowarsstore.com,

[02:49:53.340 --> 02:49:55.740]   Man, mean like a wolverine.
[02:49:55.740 --> 02:49:57.900]   These shirts are both so good,
[02:49:57.900 --> 02:49:59.180]   I don't know which one's going to
[02:49:59.180 --> 02:49:59.900]   be a best seller.
[02:49:59.900 --> 02:50:01.500]   And right through the 4th of July,

[02:50:04.380 --> 02:50:05.100]   went out and said,
[02:50:05.100 --> 02:50:06.260]   what are the top new tropics?
[02:50:06.260 --> 02:50:07.060]   Okay, here they are.
[02:50:07.060 --> 02:50:07.700]   Well, why is it 60 bucks?
[02:50:07.700 --> 02:50:09.620]   There's like $10 a product in this.
[02:50:09.620 --> 02:50:11.180]   I'll just make it even stronger,
[02:50:11.180 --> 02:50:11.940]   sell it for 30.
[02:50:11.940 --> 02:50:13.180]   When it's discounted,
[02:50:13.180 --> 02:50:14.180]   it's like 1995.
[02:50:14.180 --> 02:50:15.620]   It's 1995 right now,

[02:50:35.260 --> 02:50:36.060]   I've been a bad boy, so

[02:50:37.140 --> 02:50:38.660]   a free t-shirt of their choice.
[02:50:38.660 --> 02:50:39.260]   That's a rule,

[02:50:40.340 --> 02:50:41.580]   I've been a bad person.
[02:50:41.580 --> 02:50:42.420]   I apologize, everybody.

[02:50:49.100 --> 02:50:50.100]   >> Alex, thank you for
[02:50:50.100 --> 02:50:50.820]   taking my call.
[02:50:50.820 --> 02:50:52.540]   Thank you as well as the crew for
[02:50:52.540 --> 02:50:54.140]   the amazing fight you put up
[02:50:54.140 --> 02:50:56.060]   against the New Orlean order and
[02:50:56.060 --> 02:50:57.420]   globalism every day.
[02:50:57.420 --> 02:50:58.660]   I want to plug your products
[02:50:58.660 --> 02:50:59.260]   real quick.
[02:50:59.260 --> 02:51:00.460]   I bought pretty much all of
[02:51:00.460 --> 02:51:01.260]   your products,
[02:51:01.260 --> 02:51:02.340]   use many of them daily.
[02:51:02.340 --> 02:51:03.860]   Use others incrementally.
[02:51:03.860 --> 02:51:05.220]   I give them to family and
[02:51:05.220 --> 02:51:07.100]   friends who are struggling with
[02:51:07.100 --> 02:51:07.660]   health.
[02:51:07.660 --> 02:51:10.100]   And thank you for making it easy to
[02:51:10.100 --> 02:51:12.340]   support the tip of the spear in
[02:51:12.340 --> 02:51:13.780]   the cultural war.
[02:51:13.780 --> 02:51:14.980]   >> I want to thank you.
[02:51:14.980 --> 02:51:15.700]   I want to thank you.
[02:51:15.700 --> 02:51:17.300]   We're in this together, brother.
[02:51:17.300 --> 02:51:18.020]   I know you know this.
[02:51:18.020 --> 02:51:19.580]   When you realize how they're truly
[02:51:19.580 --> 02:51:20.800]   evil, it's not like thinking
[02:51:20.800 --> 02:51:21.660]   about each other.
[02:51:21.660 --> 02:51:22.460]   We're fighting for
[02:51:22.460 --> 02:51:23.540]   our lives here, brother.
[02:51:23.540 --> 02:51:25.460]   >> Absolutely right, I agree.
[02:51:25.460 --> 02:51:27.740]   On my 9/11 complete question,
[02:51:27.740 --> 02:51:29.860]   we know 9/11 was an inside job
[02:51:29.860 --> 02:51:32.060]   conducted by criminal elements
[02:51:32.060 --> 02:51:34.300]   fell out within our government.
[02:51:34.300 --> 02:51:36.720]   Pretty much all the evidence shows
[02:51:36.720 --> 02:51:38.660]   that 9/11 is what woke me up
[02:51:38.660 --> 02:51:41.020]   personally, you producing loose
[02:51:41.020 --> 02:51:43.300]   chains among many other things.
[02:51:43.300 --> 02:51:44.620]   In my opinion,
[02:51:44.620 --> 02:51:47.300]   9/11 is the Pandora's box,
[02:51:47.300 --> 02:51:50.000]   the skeleton key to open up the
[02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:52.880]   doors to the globalist in order for
[02:51:52.880 --> 02:51:55.260]   those who are still asleep.
[02:51:55.260 --> 02:51:57.540]   So my question on 9/11 is if
[02:51:57.540 --> 02:52:00.260]   whoever gets to take back control
[02:52:00.260 --> 02:52:02.880]   of the deep state, the people who
[02:52:02.880 --> 02:52:05.280]   were behind 9/11 needed to be
[02:52:05.280 --> 02:52:07.700]   brought to their knees, put in
[02:52:07.700 --> 02:52:09.020]   prison or worse,
[02:52:09.020 --> 02:52:11.440]   how do you see it pointing out?
[02:52:11.440 --> 02:52:12.260]   I'm very interested in your
[02:52:12.260 --> 02:52:12.780]   answer here.
[02:52:12.780 --> 02:52:13.780]   How do you see it pointing out with
[02:52:13.780 --> 02:52:14.740]   Rudy Giuliani being Trump's
[02:52:14.740 --> 02:52:15.260]   lawyer?
[02:52:15.260 --> 02:52:16.500]   >> Sure, sure, let me answer that.
[02:52:16.500 --> 02:52:17.460]   Your phone's breaking up, but
[02:52:17.460 --> 02:52:18.060]   I got most of it.
[02:52:18.060 --> 02:52:19.520]   I can do a whole hour on this and
[02:52:19.520 --> 02:52:21.240]   I promise you, I will do a live
[02:52:21.240 --> 02:52:23.020]   feed after the show just on that
[02:52:23.020 --> 02:52:24.880]   question because I was thinking
[02:52:24.880 --> 02:52:26.500]   the same thing last night and
[02:52:26.500 --> 02:52:27.460]   this morning.
[02:52:27.460 --> 02:52:29.600]   Look, if you bring out full 9/11,
[02:52:29.600 --> 02:52:31.340]   which Trump would like to do,
[02:52:31.340 --> 02:52:33.200]   it will tank the stock market.
[02:52:33.200 --> 02:52:35.120]   There will be a civil war on our
[02:52:35.120 --> 02:52:37.200]   side and it's kind of like a thing
[02:52:37.200 --> 02:52:38.840]   in war is where if the enemy
[02:52:38.840 --> 02:52:41.100]   surrenders, you let them basically
[02:52:41.100 --> 02:52:43.020]   leave and go live on an island,
[02:52:43.020 --> 02:52:44.360]   like with Napoleon.
[02:52:44.360 --> 02:52:45.280]   It's been found to be better.
[02:52:45.280 --> 02:52:48.040]   And so 9/11 did have Islamic
[02:52:48.040 --> 02:52:49.920]   involvement, but there were
[02:52:49.920 --> 02:52:52.140]   criminal elements working with it
[02:52:52.140 --> 02:52:54.140]   to stand down and all the rest of
[02:52:54.140 --> 02:52:56.020]   it and bombs the buildings.
[02:52:56.020 --> 02:52:57.100]   And so Trump knows that he said
[02:52:57.100 --> 02:52:58.180]   that at the time, that's why he's
[02:52:58.180 --> 02:52:59.220]   attacked, and now he's letting
[02:52:59.220 --> 02:53:00.180]   the deep state know I'll play
[02:53:00.180 --> 02:53:01.220]   the ace card, ace of spades,
[02:53:01.220 --> 02:53:02.140]   if you try this, okay?
[02:53:02.140 --> 02:53:03.980]   And so I trust the president
[02:53:03.980 --> 02:53:04.500]   on this.
[02:53:04.500 --> 02:53:05.420]   I'm the one that got,
[02:53:05.420 --> 02:53:06.820]   I'm not going to get into it all,
[02:53:06.820 --> 02:53:08.300]   but the president's ready to move
[02:53:08.300 --> 02:53:09.820]   and he intends to bring it all out
[02:53:09.820 --> 02:53:11.000]   in good time.
[02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:12.220]   That's a very complex issue,
[02:53:12.220 --> 02:53:12.740]   though.
[02:53:12.740 --> 02:53:14.260]   I mean, Trump is the president now,
[02:53:14.260 --> 02:53:14.620]   Will.
[02:53:14.620 --> 02:53:15.940]   Trump's the president, Joey.
[02:53:15.940 --> 02:53:17.780]   He knows all this damning stuff,
[02:53:17.780 --> 02:53:19.280]   he's kind of giving them rope.
[02:53:19.280 --> 02:53:20.160]   And I'm not saying he should cover
[02:53:20.160 --> 02:53:20.760]   anything up, but
[02:53:20.760 --> 02:53:22.000]   there's so much dirt.
[02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:24.000]   If he made it all about that,
[02:53:24.000 --> 02:53:26.400]   we would go into a civil war.
[02:53:26.400 --> 02:53:28.200]   So there's a real wisdom to this,
[02:53:28.200 --> 02:53:29.840]   and I'm lined up with Trump's
[02:53:29.840 --> 02:53:31.040]   discernment.
[02:53:31.040 --> 02:53:32.240]   And so I'm just taking it one step
[02:53:32.240 --> 02:53:32.800]   at a time.
[02:53:32.800 --> 02:53:33.520]   What do you think?
[02:53:33.520 --> 02:53:37.960]   >> I think- >> You or Joey?
[02:53:37.960 --> 02:53:39.160]   >> My opinion is that we get
[02:53:39.160 --> 02:53:41.160]   the job done, we get results.
[02:53:41.160 --> 02:53:42.600]   I've seen, you look at what's
[02:53:42.600 --> 02:53:44.160]   happening in Saudi Arabia.
[02:53:44.160 --> 02:53:45.560]   I was always uncomfortable how
[02:53:45.560 --> 02:53:47.000]   friendly we've been with them,
[02:53:47.000 --> 02:53:48.480]   especially the Bushes.
[02:53:48.480 --> 02:53:49.980]   And I was uncomfortable with how
[02:53:49.980 --> 02:53:51.380]   friendly Trump is with them.
[02:53:51.380 --> 02:53:52.500]   But if you look at it,
[02:53:52.500 --> 02:53:54.600]   they're arresting people massively,
[02:53:54.600 --> 02:53:56.320]   and it looks like things are being
[02:53:56.320 --> 02:53:57.020]   cleaned up.
[02:53:57.020 --> 02:53:57.900]   >> He's kicking that whole
[02:53:57.900 --> 02:53:58.660]   group out, yeah.
[02:53:58.660 --> 02:54:00.740]   >> Yeah, so I just want results.
[02:54:00.740 --> 02:54:02.820]   >> Well, exactly, and look,
[02:54:02.820 --> 02:54:04.260]   we've already been lied to about
[02:54:04.260 --> 02:54:05.380]   bombs in the buildings and
[02:54:05.380 --> 02:54:06.740]   all this, whatever happened.
[02:54:06.740 --> 02:54:07.980]   The point is, if Trump can get
[02:54:07.980 --> 02:54:09.500]   the people that did it out of power,
[02:54:09.500 --> 02:54:11.100]   put some in prison, that's great.
[02:54:11.100 --> 02:54:12.620]   I'm not saying cover it up,
[02:54:12.620 --> 02:54:13.680]   I'm just saying,
[02:54:13.680 --> 02:54:15.140]   how do we bring this out?
[02:54:15.140 --> 02:54:16.400]   I was just trying to expose
[02:54:16.400 --> 02:54:17.780]   the conspirators, should we get
[02:54:17.780 --> 02:54:18.980]   a good government to stop it?
[02:54:18.980 --> 02:54:20.020]   But something this bad,
[02:54:20.020 --> 02:54:21.140]   how do you bring that out?
[02:54:21.140 --> 02:54:22.940]   That's what I'm asking,
[02:54:22.940 --> 02:54:24.060]   Joey and Will.
[02:54:24.060 --> 02:54:27.900]   >> One of the things is- >> Go ahead.
[02:54:27.900 --> 02:54:30.780]   >> I was going to say,
[02:54:30.780 --> 02:54:31.660]   one of the things is,
[02:54:31.660 --> 02:54:32.780]   all you have to do is ask about
[02:54:32.780 --> 02:54:33.380]   Building 7.
[02:54:33.380 --> 02:54:35.340]   As soon as you ask about Building
[02:54:35.340 --> 02:54:37.220]   7, they all shut down.
[02:54:37.220 --> 02:54:38.540]   And one thing I hear, Alex,
[02:54:38.540 --> 02:54:39.780]   I hear a lot of people always
[02:54:39.780 --> 02:54:40.940]   talking about Infowars,
[02:54:40.940 --> 02:54:42.340]   it's conspiracy theories.
[02:54:42.340 --> 02:54:43.260]   But you know what,
[02:54:43.260 --> 02:54:44.940]   you've always been correct.
[02:54:44.940 --> 02:54:46.640]   I've yet to see them disprove what
[02:54:46.640 --> 02:54:47.560]   you're saying.
[02:54:47.560 --> 02:54:49.580]   I mean, you talk about news today
[02:54:49.580 --> 02:54:51.660]   that's going to happen tomorrow,
[02:54:51.660 --> 02:54:53.660]   and then it becomes reality, and
[02:54:53.660 --> 02:54:55.620]   they don't understand how was it
[02:54:55.620 --> 02:54:57.820]   possible that you're coming up with
[02:54:57.820 --> 02:54:59.040]   this information.
[02:54:59.040 --> 02:55:00.400]   You have the inside track to
[02:55:00.400 --> 02:55:02.160]   all of it, and they don't like it.
[02:55:02.160 --> 02:55:03.660]   That's why you get these talk
[02:55:03.660 --> 02:55:05.040]   shows attacking you the way
[02:55:05.040 --> 02:55:06.920]   that they do, it's unbelievable.
[02:55:06.920 --> 02:55:09.040]   >> The big secret is I'm not that
[02:55:09.040 --> 02:55:10.520]   smart, the globalists communicate
[02:55:10.520 --> 02:55:11.960]   in publications with each other and
[02:55:11.960 --> 02:55:13.040]   admit all this.
[02:55:13.040 --> 02:55:13.760]   And then with us,
[02:55:13.760 --> 02:55:15.020]   they treat us like we're morons.
[02:55:15.020 --> 02:55:16.460]   It's just crazy.
[02:55:16.460 --> 02:55:17.740]   I'm going to jam in one more call.
[02:55:17.740 --> 02:55:18.540]   Are you going to say something,
[02:55:18.540 --> 02:55:19.040]   Joey?
[02:55:19.040 --> 02:55:21.900]   >> I would also say maybe we should
[02:55:21.900 --> 02:55:23.540]   trust the strength of the public
[02:55:23.540 --> 02:55:24.420]   more than we do.
[02:55:24.420 --> 02:55:25.900]   I think that we can't handle
[02:55:25.900 --> 02:55:26.540]   the truth.
[02:55:26.540 --> 02:55:28.420]   And so I've just understood that
[02:55:28.420 --> 02:55:30.060]   when you lie to the public all
[02:55:30.060 --> 02:55:31.340]   the time, we tend to,
[02:55:31.340 --> 02:55:33.680]   we become too sensitive.
[02:55:33.680 --> 02:55:35.100]   So I say the truth is great for
[02:55:35.100 --> 02:55:35.860]   the country.
[02:55:35.860 --> 02:55:37.460]   >> No, I hear you, and I've not
[02:55:37.460 --> 02:55:39.420]   pushed Trump to bring out 9/11 just
[02:55:39.420 --> 02:55:41.100]   because I wasn't even thinking
[02:55:41.100 --> 02:55:42.940]   about it, and then I don't want to
[02:55:42.940 --> 02:55:43.460]   do it.
[02:55:43.460 --> 02:55:44.800]   [LAUGH] I mean,
[02:55:44.800 --> 02:55:47.520]   let me tell you, I got told.
[02:55:47.520 --> 02:55:49.920]   I mean, it's his next deal.
[02:55:49.920 --> 02:55:52.000]   I got told last night at 10 o'clock
[02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:54.040]   at night, and I was like, okay,
[02:55:54.040 --> 02:55:55.960]   all right, I'll, yes, sir.
[02:55:55.960 --> 02:55:58.960]   I'll, wasn't Trump, obviously,
[02:55:58.960 --> 02:56:01.120]   I was talking to, but the-
[02:56:01.120 --> 02:56:05.200]   [LAUGH] These guys are in a lot of
[02:56:05.200 --> 02:56:07.200]   trouble, man.
[02:56:07.200 --> 02:56:08.560]   I can't believe how good Trump is,
[02:56:08.560 --> 02:56:09.080]   though.
[02:56:09.080 --> 02:56:10.280]   My gut, my spirit tells me he's
[02:56:10.280 --> 02:56:11.760]   good, but I keep getting paranoid.
[02:56:11.760 --> 02:56:12.720]   Is this really happening?
[02:56:12.720 --> 02:56:13.660]   What do you guys think about that?
[02:56:13.660 --> 02:56:14.420]   I mean, at a gut,
[02:56:14.420 --> 02:56:15.860]   a spiritual level, what do you,
[02:56:15.860 --> 02:56:17.380]   when you ask Christ about Trump,
[02:56:17.380 --> 02:56:18.820]   what do you get back?
[02:56:18.820 --> 02:56:20.280]   I get back, this is my wrecking
[02:56:20.280 --> 02:56:21.580]   ball, get out of the way.
[02:56:21.580 --> 02:56:23.500]   >> I think Trump is what this
[02:56:23.500 --> 02:56:26.300]   country needed this day and time.
[02:56:26.300 --> 02:56:28.420]   This 100%, I'm still thankful,
[02:56:28.420 --> 02:56:29.820]   thank God that Donald J.
[02:56:29.820 --> 02:56:31.340]   Trump is our president and
[02:56:31.340 --> 02:56:33.100]   not the Hilda Beetz, Hillary
[02:56:33.100 --> 02:56:34.260]   Clinton.
[02:56:34.260 --> 02:56:35.420]   She would have destroyed
[02:56:35.420 --> 02:56:36.020]   everything.
[02:56:36.020 --> 02:56:37.260]   The Democrats are on a path to
[02:56:37.260 --> 02:56:38.940]   destroy this- >> They're Satanists,
[02:56:38.940 --> 02:56:40.260]   they can't do anything but destroy.
[02:56:41.220 --> 02:56:42.860]   >> Yes, and that is their plan,
[02:56:42.860 --> 02:56:44.760]   that's what they want to do.
[02:56:44.760 --> 02:56:46.280]   And I think what we're doing,
[02:56:46.280 --> 02:56:48.280]   we're trying to expose all of that.
[02:56:48.280 --> 02:56:50.280]   When I went to the cafe in Oakland,
[02:56:50.280 --> 02:56:51.960]   the whole point was to expose
[02:56:51.960 --> 02:56:53.080]   the hatefulness,
[02:56:53.080 --> 02:56:55.320]   the evilness of the left, 100%.
[02:56:55.320 --> 02:56:56.320]   >> God, they're so hateful.
[02:56:56.320 --> 02:56:57.400]   What happened to the left,
[02:56:57.400 --> 02:56:58.640]   though, because I was younger.
[02:56:58.640 --> 02:56:59.600]   There were a lot of nice hippies,
[02:56:59.600 --> 02:57:00.560]   liberals that were smart about
[02:57:00.560 --> 02:57:01.280]   stuff that was right.
[02:57:01.280 --> 02:57:02.360]   They didn't have that spirit.
[02:57:02.360 --> 02:57:04.920]   There were some bad Republicans and
[02:57:04.920 --> 02:57:05.600]   bad Democrats.
[02:57:05.600 --> 02:57:06.760]   It was kind of a mix, but
[02:57:06.760 --> 02:57:08.280]   something happened along the way
[02:57:08.280 --> 02:57:09.200]   with Democrats.
[02:57:09.200 --> 02:57:10.160]   I think just the media
[02:57:10.160 --> 02:57:11.000]   weaponized them.
[02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:12.420]   >> I think personally,
[02:57:12.420 --> 02:57:14.740]   I think Satan realized his time is
[02:57:14.740 --> 02:57:15.340]   short.
[02:57:15.340 --> 02:57:17.120]   So he's trying to work on these
[02:57:17.120 --> 02:57:18.300]   people to destroy.
[02:57:18.300 --> 02:57:19.640]   You got to go faster and
[02:57:19.640 --> 02:57:21.520]   faster to do as much as you can to
[02:57:21.520 --> 02:57:22.940]   destroy this nation.
[02:57:22.940 --> 02:57:25.300]   Time is wasting according to them.
[02:57:25.300 --> 02:57:26.900]   If Satan went to the DNC and
[02:57:26.900 --> 02:57:28.740]   was talking to the Democrats,
[02:57:28.740 --> 02:57:30.700]   which policy would the Democrats
[02:57:30.700 --> 02:57:31.700]   disagree with?
[02:57:31.700 --> 02:57:32.460]   None of them.
[02:57:32.460 --> 02:57:33.460]   >> That's right. >> They would agree
[02:57:33.460 --> 02:57:34.300]   with all of them.
[02:57:34.300 --> 02:57:35.660]   >> We'll be back.

[03:00:01.560 --> 03:00:04.240]   >> Well, here we are,
[03:00:04.240 --> 03:00:05.840]   July 5th, 2018,
[03:00:05.840 --> 03:00:08.440]   another epic July 4th has come and
[03:00:08.440 --> 03:00:10.840]   gone, and never has it been more
[03:00:10.840 --> 03:00:13.040]   clear where the stakes are for
[03:00:13.040 --> 03:00:14.000]   humanity.
[03:00:14.000 --> 03:00:15.200]   But I want to make a point,
[03:00:15.200 --> 03:00:16.520]   there's a Churchill quote,
[03:00:16.520 --> 03:00:18.240]   I'm paraphrasing it, that many
[03:00:18.240 --> 03:00:19.720]   people get hit by history,
[03:00:19.720 --> 03:00:21.440]   they get run over in the street by
[03:00:21.440 --> 03:00:23.440]   huge, big, epic developments, and
[03:00:23.440 --> 03:00:25.160]   they kind of dust themselves off
[03:00:25.160 --> 03:00:26.840]   and ignore the point in history
[03:00:26.840 --> 03:00:27.880]   that they're in.
[03:00:27.880 --> 03:00:30.040]   But there are other people that
[03:00:30.040 --> 03:00:31.560]   get hit by destiny and
[03:00:31.560 --> 03:00:33.000]   hit by history, and
[03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:34.960]   they get up and it changes the
[03:00:34.960 --> 03:00:36.680]   course of their lives and
[03:00:36.680 --> 03:00:39.040]   countless other people's lives.
[03:00:39.040 --> 03:00:40.760]   And so I want people to remember
[03:00:40.760 --> 03:00:42.640]   that the hundreds of millions that
[03:00:42.640 --> 03:00:43.960]   died under communism and
[03:00:43.960 --> 03:00:45.640]   the tens of millions that died
[03:00:45.640 --> 03:00:47.400]   under fascism and other cults and
[03:00:47.400 --> 03:00:49.120]   permutations of governmental
[03:00:49.120 --> 03:00:50.960]   control, and societal mental
[03:00:50.960 --> 03:00:53.000]   illness manifest by government,
[03:00:53.000 --> 03:00:54.880]   that we are on the precipice of
[03:00:54.880 --> 03:00:56.560]   a new global revolution,
[03:00:56.560 --> 03:00:57.840]   a new renaissance.
[03:00:57.840 --> 03:00:59.840]   And we're actually, because of
[03:00:59.840 --> 03:01:01.880]   other people's work before us,
[03:01:01.880 --> 03:01:03.880]   sitting on a great brain trust of
[03:01:03.880 --> 03:01:06.080]   human liberty, and that we've got
[03:01:06.080 --> 03:01:08.200]   a chance to fight for freedom when
[03:01:08.200 --> 03:01:10.280]   the odds are actually on our side
[03:01:10.280 --> 03:01:11.480]   if we realize it.
[03:01:11.480 --> 03:01:13.880]   And we've got to look back on those
[03:01:13.880 --> 03:01:16.320]   that didn't have a chance to win,
[03:01:16.320 --> 03:01:18.560]   but took action and did what was
[03:01:18.560 --> 03:01:20.840]   right because it was about their
[03:01:20.840 --> 03:01:23.000]   soul and about the spiritual,
[03:01:23.000 --> 03:01:25.600]   cultural, human decision they were
[03:01:25.600 --> 03:01:26.520]   making, and
[03:01:26.520 --> 03:01:29.000]   that's why they were fulfilled.
[03:01:29.000 --> 03:01:30.840]   So again, ladies and gentlemen,
[03:01:30.840 --> 03:01:32.080]   I want to thank you all for
[03:01:32.080 --> 03:01:32.880]   your support.
[03:01:32.880 --> 03:01:33.880]   I want to thank you all for
[03:01:33.880 --> 03:01:34.480]   your prayers.
[03:01:34.480 --> 03:01:35.640]   I want to thank you all for
[03:01:35.640 --> 03:01:37.040]   what you've done against the
[03:01:37.040 --> 03:01:38.680]   bullies and the peer pressure over
[03:01:38.680 --> 03:01:40.520]   the years, because if it wasn't for
[03:01:40.520 --> 03:01:41.880]   you, and if it wasn't for
[03:01:41.880 --> 03:01:43.280]   everything you've done,
[03:01:43.280 --> 03:01:44.440]   we wouldn't be here.
[03:01:44.440 --> 03:01:47.720]   Many of those people aren't here
[03:01:47.720 --> 03:01:51.120]   today that stood up for what was
[03:01:51.120 --> 03:01:53.520]   right, but in their gut,
[03:01:53.520 --> 03:01:55.520]   they believed in you and
[03:01:55.520 --> 03:01:57.000]   they believed in me.
[03:01:57.000 --> 03:01:58.400]   And they believed that we could
[03:01:58.400 --> 03:01:59.880]   build a better future.
[03:01:59.880 --> 03:02:01.600]   They had goodwill towards people.
[03:02:01.600 --> 03:02:02.960]   They didn't want to use the fact
[03:02:02.960 --> 03:02:04.360]   that they had more knowledge than
[03:02:04.360 --> 03:02:05.640]   the average person to control
[03:02:05.640 --> 03:02:06.200]   that person.
[03:02:06.200 --> 03:02:08.360]   They didn't want to use the fact
[03:02:08.360 --> 03:02:10.040]   that they understood how the game
[03:02:10.040 --> 03:02:11.720]   was played to then set up a little
[03:02:11.720 --> 03:02:13.440]   secret cabal and feed on people.
[03:02:13.440 --> 03:02:15.360]   They had the true vision of human
[03:02:15.360 --> 03:02:17.480]   empowerment and the true mastery to
[03:02:17.480 --> 03:02:18.640]   empower others and
[03:02:18.640 --> 03:02:20.440]   bring them to the next level.
[03:02:20.440 --> 03:02:24.160]   They were Christ-like in their duty,
[03:02:24.160 --> 03:02:26.480]   in their focus, in their sacrifice,
[03:02:26.480 --> 03:02:27.920]   in their commitment.
[03:02:27.920 --> 03:02:29.720]   And so that's why it's obnoxious.
[03:02:29.720 --> 03:02:31.280]   It's flagrant.
[03:02:31.280 --> 03:02:32.640]   It's arrogant.
[03:02:32.640 --> 03:02:34.040]   It's narcissistic.
[03:02:34.040 --> 03:02:36.080]   It's satanic to make the victories
[03:02:36.080 --> 03:02:37.720]   we're having about Trump or
[03:02:37.720 --> 03:02:39.640]   about Infowars or about anybody
[03:02:39.640 --> 03:02:40.160]   else.
[03:02:40.160 --> 03:02:42.280]   It's about you and your awakening
[03:02:42.280 --> 03:02:44.240]   and the decisions you've made.
[03:02:44.240 --> 03:02:46.160]   So I just want to tell you as we've
[03:02:46.160 --> 03:02:48.040]   passed through this July 4th,
[03:02:48.040 --> 03:02:50.120]   2018, as the globalists launched
[03:02:50.120 --> 03:02:52.080]   their riots, their attacks, and
[03:02:52.080 --> 03:02:54.200]   their lies, and their moralizing,
[03:02:54.200 --> 03:02:56.280]   that have good cheer, my friends,
[03:02:56.280 --> 03:02:58.280]   because we're living in a time and
[03:02:58.280 --> 03:03:00.280]   age when the devil knows the time
[03:03:00.280 --> 03:03:02.160]   is short, so he sends the beast
[03:03:02.160 --> 03:03:03.040]   with wrath.
[03:03:03.040 --> 03:03:05.480]   And their whole world government
[03:03:05.480 --> 03:03:06.640]   system's here, the mark of
[03:03:06.640 --> 03:03:07.920]   the beast, it's going to be a lot
[03:03:07.920 --> 03:03:09.280]   of trials, a lot of tribulations.
[03:03:09.280 --> 03:03:11.080]   But we know the truth, and
[03:03:11.080 --> 03:03:12.560]   we know who wins, and
[03:03:12.560 --> 03:03:14.520]   we know where this all goes.
[03:03:14.520 --> 03:03:17.680]   And so that's a very positive fact
[03:03:17.680 --> 03:03:19.200]   to understand.
[03:03:19.200 --> 03:03:24.680]   All that matters is what you stand
[03:03:24.680 --> 03:03:25.180]   for.
[03:03:25.180 --> 03:03:26.880]   [SOUND] All that matters is not
[03:03:26.880 --> 03:03:27.840]   being a coward.
[03:03:27.840 --> 03:03:29.240]   [SOUND] And not feeding on people
[03:03:29.240 --> 03:03:30.560]   that aren't as smart as you.
[03:03:30.560 --> 03:03:32.440]   And the minute you realize that,
[03:03:32.440 --> 03:03:34.240]   you're in God's arms forever.
[03:03:34.240 --> 03:03:35.680]   And these Satanists, and
[03:03:35.680 --> 03:03:37.000]   these Crowleyites, and
[03:03:37.000 --> 03:03:38.200]   these Democrats, and
[03:03:38.200 --> 03:03:39.320]   these Chi-Coms, and
[03:03:39.320 --> 03:03:41.000]   all these control freaks who want
[03:03:41.000 --> 03:03:42.800]   to control reality, who want to try
[03:03:42.800 --> 03:03:44.280]   to become a god, because they
[03:03:44.280 --> 03:03:45.680]   merge with AI technology.
[03:03:45.680 --> 03:03:46.680]   They don't understand,
[03:03:46.680 --> 03:03:47.840]   they already had a connection
[03:03:47.840 --> 03:03:48.360]   to God.
[03:03:48.360 --> 03:03:50.120]   They were already an expression of
[03:03:50.120 --> 03:03:52.040]   God's consciousness in the universe,
[03:03:52.040 --> 03:03:53.680]   and there was no need to ever even
[03:03:53.680 --> 03:03:54.200]   do that.
[03:03:54.200 --> 03:03:56.480]   But that's why we have free will.
[03:03:56.480 --> 03:03:58.800]   Some people will fall to the lower
[03:03:58.800 --> 03:03:59.760]   dimension.
[03:03:59.760 --> 03:04:01.620]   Some people will rise and
[03:04:01.620 --> 03:04:03.960]   ascend towards a communion and
[03:04:03.960 --> 03:04:06.200]   a reunification with Christ.
[03:04:06.200 --> 03:04:08.040]   And that's the big choice, and
[03:04:08.040 --> 03:04:09.880]   that's why I know you've made
[03:04:09.880 --> 03:04:11.080]   the right choice.
[03:04:11.080 --> 03:04:12.400]   You're not going to find Christ in
[03:04:12.400 --> 03:04:13.480]   these whorehouse churches.
[03:04:13.480 --> 03:04:15.440]   That's where the literal globalists
[03:04:15.440 --> 03:04:17.080]   run the operation via the World
[03:04:17.080 --> 03:04:18.320]   Council of Churches.
[03:04:18.320 --> 03:04:20.280]   But you're going to find the real
[03:04:20.280 --> 03:04:22.560]   Christ in your heart, seeking after
[03:04:22.560 --> 03:04:24.320]   God and saying, I want to be
[03:04:24.320 --> 03:04:25.360]   a good person.
[03:04:25.360 --> 03:04:26.280]   I want to be just.
[03:04:26.280 --> 03:04:27.120]   I want to be honorable.
[03:04:27.120 --> 03:04:28.440]   I'm going to tell the truth.
[03:04:28.440 --> 03:04:30.160]   So again, are those of us here when
[03:04:30.160 --> 03:04:31.880]   we're seeing this great awakening
[03:04:31.880 --> 03:04:32.480]   the heroes?
[03:04:32.480 --> 03:04:34.720]   No, the heroes are those in
[03:04:34.720 --> 03:04:36.760]   Communist China and North Korea and
[03:04:36.760 --> 03:04:38.640]   old Soviet Russia and countless
[03:04:38.640 --> 03:04:40.440]   other places like Cuba that were
[03:04:40.440 --> 03:04:42.240]   tortured and murdered and killed
[03:04:42.240 --> 03:04:43.960]   and watched their children go to
[03:04:43.960 --> 03:04:45.880]   prison because they didn't deny God
[03:04:45.880 --> 03:04:46.720]   and the truth.
[03:04:46.720 --> 03:04:48.200]   And to them on this July 4th,
[03:04:48.200 --> 03:04:49.440]   I want to thank you all and
[03:04:49.440 --> 03:04:51.240]   thank you for 1776 worldwide.

[03:06:24.640 --> 03:06:31.720]   Paul Watson's about to get on.
[03:06:31.720 --> 03:06:32.840]   We only got two Skype lines, so
[03:06:32.840 --> 03:06:33.920]   we're going to get one of these
[03:06:33.920 --> 03:06:34.560]   great guys off.
[03:06:34.560 --> 03:06:36.160]   Paul dialed in about to take over.
[03:06:36.160 --> 03:06:36.840]   Finishing up,
[03:06:36.840 --> 03:06:38.200]   statements on just the epic moment

[03:06:38.720 --> 03:06:39.840]   We're at Will Johnson of

[03:06:41.120 --> 03:06:42.800]   >> Yes, thank you for
[03:06:42.800 --> 03:06:44.920]   having me once again.
[03:06:44.920 --> 03:06:46.480]   I've really enjoyed it.
[03:06:46.480 --> 03:06:47.720]   It's been a real honor.
[03:06:47.720 --> 03:06:49.000]   I would like to extend an
[03:06:49.000 --> 03:06:50.840]   invitation to you, Alex Jones,
[03:06:50.840 --> 03:06:52.640]   to come on my broadcast with me if
[03:06:52.640 --> 03:06:53.800]   that's possible.
[03:06:53.800 --> 03:06:55.000]   You are either Owen or
[03:06:55.000 --> 03:06:56.560]   most definitely even Rob.
[03:06:56.560 --> 03:06:57.760]   >> I want to come on your show
[03:06:57.760 --> 03:06:58.280]   anytime.
[03:06:58.280 --> 03:07:00.480]   >> That would be absolutely
[03:07:00.480 --> 03:07:03.280]   phenomenal if you would join me.
[03:07:03.280 --> 03:07:04.360]   I just want to say, you know what?
[03:07:04.360 --> 03:07:06.840]   InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[03:07:06.840 --> 03:07:08.720]   I think what you're doing is so
[03:07:08.720 --> 03:07:09.800]   heroic.
[03:07:09.800 --> 03:07:12.040]   It's just something that we all can
[03:07:12.040 --> 03:07:13.720]   look up to and admire, and
[03:07:13.720 --> 03:07:15.760]   that we have to get in this fight
[03:07:15.760 --> 03:07:16.520]   together.
[03:07:16.520 --> 03:07:17.760]   Getting down is no longer
[03:07:17.760 --> 03:07:18.640]   an option.
[03:07:18.640 --> 03:07:19.880]   So I want to thank you for
[03:07:19.880 --> 03:07:21.480]   having me on, and Owen as well.
[03:07:21.480 --> 03:07:22.360]   >> I want to thank you,
[03:07:22.360 --> 03:07:23.080]   God bless you.
[03:07:23.080 --> 03:07:24.320]   Let me just say something about
[03:07:24.320 --> 03:07:24.960]   Will Johnson,
[03:07:24.960 --> 03:07:26.120]   youngamericafirst.com.
[03:07:26.120 --> 03:07:27.120]   See how humble he is?
[03:07:27.120 --> 03:07:28.320]   He's just as well spoken,
[03:07:28.320 --> 03:07:30.240]   has just as much courage as I do.
[03:07:30.240 --> 03:07:31.040]   He heard what we were doing.
[03:07:31.040 --> 03:07:31.760]   He was already awake.
[03:07:31.760 --> 03:07:32.840]   He went out and took action.
[03:07:32.840 --> 03:07:34.160]   He's just here thanking us.
[03:07:34.160 --> 03:07:34.800]   Take the left.
[03:07:34.800 --> 03:07:35.600]   It's all about them,
[03:07:35.600 --> 03:07:36.520]   about their Satanism,
[03:07:36.520 --> 03:07:37.720]   about their personal power,
[03:07:37.720 --> 03:07:38.920]   about where they're going.
[03:07:38.920 --> 03:07:40.360]   They think they're ascending,
[03:07:40.360 --> 03:07:41.880]   they're sinking into hell.
[03:07:41.880 --> 03:07:43.080]   Christ is the way to get out of
[03:07:43.080 --> 03:07:44.200]   this, and we know that, and
[03:07:44.200 --> 03:07:45.480]   that's why they hate us.
[03:07:45.480 --> 03:07:46.760]   That's why they're coming after
[03:07:46.760 --> 03:07:48.200]   us. That was Will Johnson leaving
[03:07:48.200 --> 03:07:48.760]   us.
[03:07:48.760 --> 03:07:50.280]   Joey Gibson, with your prayer
[03:07:50.280 --> 03:07:52.080]   vigils that get attacked by Antifa.
[03:07:52.080 --> 03:07:53.640]   Again, tell us about that next
[03:07:53.640 --> 03:07:55.080]   event you've got coming up.
[03:07:55.080 --> 03:07:56.560]   Did you say August 5th?
[03:07:56.560 --> 03:07:59.000]   >> August 4th.
[03:07:59.000 --> 03:08:00.000]   >> August 4th, sorry.
[03:08:00.000 --> 03:08:02.760]   >> Basically, the goal is this,
[03:08:02.760 --> 03:08:04.440]   is we respond by their violence
[03:08:04.440 --> 03:08:06.240]   with getting more people to show
[03:08:06.240 --> 03:08:08.000]   up. If we can flood the streets
[03:08:08.000 --> 03:08:09.600]   with thousands of people,
[03:08:09.600 --> 03:08:11.520]   we know the support is out there.
[03:08:11.520 --> 03:08:13.040]   It's about inspiring them to
[03:08:13.040 --> 03:08:14.400]   actually go out there and
[03:08:14.400 --> 03:08:16.200]   stand up for what they believe in.
[03:08:16.200 --> 03:08:17.560]   Because the enemy, the elites,
[03:08:17.560 --> 03:08:18.760]   all these people at the top,
[03:08:18.760 --> 03:08:20.120]   they don't want us to stand up for
[03:08:20.120 --> 03:08:21.040]   what we believe in.
[03:08:21.040 --> 03:08:22.680]   They want us to remain silent.
[03:08:22.680 --> 03:08:23.960]   And Alex, if you can be there,
[03:08:23.960 --> 03:08:25.320]   you're the one guy that can bring
[03:08:25.320 --> 03:08:26.800]   thousands of people with you, and
[03:08:26.800 --> 03:08:27.840]   we'd love to have you.
[03:08:27.840 --> 03:08:29.680]   And I think it will make the event
[03:08:29.680 --> 03:08:31.600]   a lot more safe, because we can't
[03:08:31.600 --> 03:08:33.080]   trust the police if we just
[03:08:33.080 --> 03:08:34.400]   flooded the streets.
[03:08:34.400 --> 03:08:35.600]   >> I want to go to all these
[03:08:35.600 --> 03:08:36.120]   events.
[03:08:36.120 --> 03:08:38.280]   Here's the thing, I'm here running
[03:08:38.280 --> 03:08:40.240]   these operations, and I'm every
[03:08:40.240 --> 03:08:42.200]   day getting important communique
[03:08:42.200 --> 03:08:43.480]   is what we need to do.
[03:08:43.480 --> 03:08:44.600]   And I want to do it, and
[03:08:44.600 --> 03:08:46.080]   then they've got me pinned down
[03:08:46.080 --> 03:08:47.120]   because when I leave,
[03:08:47.120 --> 03:08:48.280]   they go after my family.
[03:08:48.280 --> 03:08:49.560]   I've got to take my family with me
[03:08:49.560 --> 03:08:50.200]   now everywhere.
[03:08:50.200 --> 03:08:51.600]   It's gotten really bad.
[03:08:51.600 --> 03:08:52.600]   I can't get into all that.
[03:08:52.600 --> 03:08:53.720]   I had to go off air yesterday
[03:08:53.720 --> 03:08:54.320]   because of it.
[03:08:54.320 --> 03:08:56.120]   We need everybody's prayers here.
[03:08:56.120 --> 03:08:56.920]   I'm not complaining about it.
[03:08:56.920 --> 03:08:58.200]   I asked for all this, but
[03:08:58.200 --> 03:08:59.320]   I do need the prayers.
[03:08:59.320 --> 03:09:01.320]   So absolutely, Joey, thank you so
[03:09:01.320 --> 03:09:01.840]   much.
[03:09:01.840 --> 03:09:02.880]   We'll talk to you soon.
[03:09:02.880 --> 03:09:03.380]   Great job.
[03:09:03.380 --> 03:09:05.600]   >> Well, and thanks to the support
[03:09:05.600 --> 03:09:06.560]   we get from our audience.
[03:09:06.560 --> 03:09:08.200]   We have so many reporters now that
[03:09:08.200 --> 03:09:09.760]   we can actually send crews out to
[03:09:09.760 --> 03:09:11.480]   these events, get the footage.
[03:09:11.480 --> 03:09:12.440]   And that's the key,
[03:09:12.440 --> 03:09:13.720]   get the footage and just put
[03:09:13.720 --> 03:09:15.160]   a camera up to these people and
[03:09:15.160 --> 03:09:16.000]   just say, hey,
[03:09:16.000 --> 03:09:17.520]   what are you doing out here?
[03:09:17.520 --> 03:09:19.040]   I'm protesting at children being
[03:09:19.040 --> 03:09:20.840]   separated from children.
[03:09:20.840 --> 03:09:22.000]   Really, I guess you didn't care
[03:09:22.000 --> 03:09:23.320]   about it eight years ago then.
[03:09:23.320 --> 03:09:24.680]   >> Or whistleblowers have come out
[03:09:24.680 --> 03:09:25.920]   that Obama would put them with
[03:09:25.920 --> 03:09:26.880]   child traffickers and
[03:09:26.880 --> 03:09:27.880]   have them unvetted.
[03:09:27.880 --> 03:09:29.120]   Here, just let kids cross the
[03:09:29.120 --> 03:09:30.920]   border and get in vans randomly.
[03:09:30.920 --> 03:09:31.840]   That's a great idea.
[03:09:31.840 --> 03:09:33.160]   Coyotes can just pick them right up
[03:09:33.160 --> 03:09:33.960]   on the Texas side.
[03:09:33.960 --> 03:09:35.480]   >> Yeah. >> What a wonderful idea.
[03:09:35.480 --> 03:09:36.800]   Violate federal law.
[03:09:36.800 --> 03:09:37.880]   >> Their parents send them here
[03:09:37.880 --> 03:09:39.080]   with playing darker than night in
[03:09:39.080 --> 03:09:40.240]   a desert with rattlesnakes.
[03:09:40.240 --> 03:09:41.320]   Little kids come across with
[03:09:41.320 --> 03:09:42.400]   people who don't even know who
[03:09:42.400 --> 03:09:43.080]   the hell they are.
[03:09:43.080 --> 03:09:44.600]   Don't check anybody, just here,
[03:09:44.600 --> 03:09:45.160]   come on in.
[03:09:45.160 --> 03:09:46.200]   >> And it sounds great,
[03:09:46.200 --> 03:09:47.080]   open borders.
[03:09:47.080 --> 03:09:48.720]   But we don't want open borders.
[03:09:48.720 --> 03:09:49.840]   That's not what we want.
[03:09:49.840 --> 03:09:50.960]   Well, Alex- >> But everyone has
[03:09:50.960 --> 03:09:51.920]   the right to just come on in,
[03:09:51.920 --> 03:09:52.720]   according to- >> But
[03:09:52.720 --> 03:09:53.880]   that's why you expose them.
[03:09:53.880 --> 03:09:55.160]   That's why you put them on camera,
[03:09:55.160 --> 03:09:56.160]   you show who they are, and
[03:09:56.160 --> 03:09:57.560]   then you have #WalkAwayTrend on.
[03:09:57.560 --> 03:09:59.000]   >> Hey, look who that is right
[03:09:59.000 --> 03:09:59.520]   there.
[03:09:59.520 --> 03:10:01.240]   That's Paul Joseph Watson,
[03:10:01.240 --> 03:10:03.240]   the great, over there in the UK.
[03:10:03.240 --> 03:10:04.800]   Big article about Trump getting
[03:10:04.800 --> 03:10:06.440]   ready to come out about 9/11.
[03:10:06.440 --> 03:10:07.200]   That's all coming up.
[03:10:07.200 --> 03:10:08.440]   He's taking over in T-2 minutes.
[03:10:08.440 --> 03:10:09.880]   But first, your announcement to
[03:10:09.880 --> 03:10:11.600]   the President that we've got here.
[03:10:11.600 --> 03:10:13.320]   >> Well, I wanted to do something
[03:10:13.320 --> 03:10:15.160]   special for President Trump for
[03:10:15.160 --> 03:10:16.240]   the 4th of July.
[03:10:16.240 --> 03:10:17.960]   And I noticed that he got snubbed
[03:10:17.960 --> 03:10:19.640]   by the Philadelphia Eagles.
[03:10:19.640 --> 03:10:20.400]   I couldn't believe it.
[03:10:20.400 --> 03:10:21.840]   He got snubbed by the Super Bowl
[03:10:21.840 --> 03:10:22.840]   champion Eagles.
[03:10:22.840 --> 03:10:24.080]   And he did not get his
[03:10:24.080 --> 03:10:25.480]   championship jersey.
[03:10:25.480 --> 03:10:27.320]   So I went ahead and I ordered one
[03:10:27.320 --> 03:10:28.920]   for you, President Trump.
[03:10:28.920 --> 03:10:30.760]   This is your 4th of July present
[03:10:30.760 --> 03:10:31.560]   right here.
[03:10:31.560 --> 03:10:32.160]   >> Mail that,
[03:10:32.160 --> 03:10:33.720]   I can get it delivered right to him.
[03:10:33.720 --> 03:10:35.320]   >> It's the Eagles Trump jersey.
[03:10:35.320 --> 03:10:36.320]   I don't know why they didn't want
[03:10:36.320 --> 03:10:36.960]   to give it to you, but
[03:10:36.960 --> 03:10:38.160]   I had it made, President Trump.
[03:10:38.160 --> 03:10:39.400]   We've got it for you right here in
[03:10:39.400 --> 03:10:40.560]   the InfoWars studio.
[03:10:40.560 --> 03:10:41.200]   This is for you.
[03:10:41.200 --> 03:10:42.200]   >> By the way, I've got a special
[03:10:42.200 --> 03:10:43.480]   address, I can mail him anything.
[03:10:43.480 --> 03:10:45.000]   A little secret out.
[03:10:45.000 --> 03:10:47.400]   We'll mail that sucker right to
[03:10:47.400 --> 03:10:48.360]   him today.
[03:10:48.360 --> 03:10:50.240]   [LAUGH] >> This is for
[03:10:50.240 --> 03:10:51.760]   President Trump.
[03:10:51.760 --> 03:10:53.760]   Go America, go Trump, fly Eagles,
[03:10:53.760 --> 03:10:54.280]   fly.
[03:10:54.280 --> 03:10:55.360]   We came into the segment,
[03:10:55.360 --> 03:10:56.560]   it wasn't even supposed to be that
[03:10:56.560 --> 03:10:57.560]   way with fly like an Eagle.
[03:10:57.560 --> 03:10:58.680]   So here we are.
[03:10:58.680 --> 03:10:59.240]   >> By the way,
[03:10:59.240 --> 03:11:00.240]   that wasn't even a setup,
[03:11:00.240 --> 03:11:01.200]   that just happened.
[03:11:01.200 --> 03:11:02.520]   >> President Trump is flying like
[03:11:02.520 --> 03:11:03.040]   an Eagle.
[03:11:03.040 --> 03:11:04.920]   He got snubbed by the Super Bowl
[03:11:04.920 --> 03:11:05.840]   champions.
[03:11:05.840 --> 03:11:06.480]   I'm not buying it.
[03:11:06.480 --> 03:11:08.440]   So I wanted President Trump to
[03:11:08.440 --> 03:11:10.640]   get his jersey here, recognized as
[03:11:10.640 --> 03:11:12.480]   President 45, the greatest
[03:11:12.480 --> 03:11:14.040]   president in modern history.
[03:11:14.040 --> 03:11:15.400]   And here is your Super Bowl
[03:11:15.400 --> 03:11:16.820]   champion, Eagles jersey,
[03:11:16.820 --> 03:11:17.820]   President Trump.
[03:11:17.820 --> 03:11:19.840]   I hope this receives you well, and
[03:11:19.840 --> 03:11:21.180]   you deserve it.
[03:11:21.180 --> 03:11:22.520]   >> Notice that Lynch and
[03:11:22.520 --> 03:11:24.440]   all these top real liberals are
[03:11:24.440 --> 03:11:26.440]   saying Trump may be the greatest
[03:11:26.440 --> 03:11:27.560]   president ever.
[03:11:27.560 --> 03:11:28.560]   I mean, let me tell you.
[03:11:28.560 --> 03:11:29.780]   >> When history pans out,
[03:11:29.780 --> 03:11:31.000]   we can talk about that.
[03:11:31.000 --> 03:11:32.360]   But modern history, my life,
[03:11:32.360 --> 03:11:33.360]   not even close.
[03:11:33.360 --> 03:11:34.520]   There's no debate.
[03:11:34.520 --> 03:11:35.440]   >> He's already eclipsed Reagan.
[03:11:37.080 --> 03:11:38.200]   Because Reagan got shot in
[03:11:38.200 --> 03:11:39.320]   the first year to get him.
[03:11:39.320 --> 03:11:40.360]   All right, Paul Watson,
[03:11:40.360 --> 03:11:41.360]   you're taking over my friend.
[03:11:41.360 --> 03:11:42.360]   Great job.
[03:11:42.360 --> 03:11:43.240]   We love you. We appreciate you.
[03:11:43.240 --> 03:11:44.840]   By the way, we have the new t-shirt
[03:11:44.840 --> 03:11:46.280]   we're selling because they have
[03:11:46.280 --> 03:11:47.880]   impeach Trump 45 at Walmart.
[03:11:47.880 --> 03:11:49.400]   We have reelect Trump at
[03:11:49.400 --> 03:11:52.040]   Infowarsstore.com, reelect 45.
[03:11:52.040 --> 03:11:55.640]   So it's reelect, not the other one.
[03:11:55.640 --> 03:11:57.000]   That's now exclusively available.
[03:11:57.000 --> 03:11:58.320]   They're getting printed right here,
[03:11:58.320 --> 03:11:59.080]   right here in Texas.
[03:11:59.080 --> 03:11:59.920]   Shipped out next week,
[03:11:59.920 --> 03:12:00.760]   get your order in now.
[03:12:00.760 --> 03:12:02.560]   Infowarsstore.com, no reviews yet.
[03:12:02.560 --> 03:12:03.280]   We just launched today.
[03:12:03.280 --> 03:12:04.280]   And then we have,
[03:12:04.280 --> 03:12:06.040]   we have meme like a Wolverine.
[03:12:07.040 --> 03:12:08.040]   It's not the Marvel comic
[03:12:08.040 --> 03:12:08.800]   wimpy Wolverine.
[03:12:08.800 --> 03:12:09.920]   It's the Trump Wolverine.
[03:12:09.920 --> 03:12:11.000]   Can we pull that up?
[03:12:11.000 --> 03:12:12.200]   That's available at
[03:12:12.200 --> 03:12:13.600]   Infowarsstore.com.
[03:12:13.600 --> 03:12:14.880]   So be sure and get those and
[03:12:14.880 --> 03:12:15.920]   find the operation.
[03:12:15.920 --> 03:12:18.200]   Everybody have a great July 4th.
[03:12:18.200 --> 03:12:19.920]   And now the master of ceremony for
[03:12:19.920 --> 03:12:21.800]   the 2018 July 4th is the red coat
[03:12:21.800 --> 03:12:24.080]   Supreme Leader, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:12:24.080 --> 03:12:25.000]   My friend, please take over.
[03:12:25.000 --> 03:12:26.720]   >> Thanks, Alex.
[03:12:26.720 --> 03:12:28.160]   Happy 4th of July.
[03:12:28.160 --> 03:12:29.680]   Yeah, I'm looking at these polls
[03:12:29.680 --> 03:12:31.240]   which have come out since the whole
[03:12:31.240 --> 03:12:32.720]   scandal over the border issue,
[03:12:32.720 --> 03:12:34.080]   which of course was the latest
[03:12:34.080 --> 03:12:35.680]   scandal that was supposed to think
[03:12:35.680 --> 03:12:37.040]   President Trump for good.
[03:12:37.040 --> 03:12:38.360]   We have one every week from
[03:12:38.360 --> 03:12:39.880]   the mainstream media.
[03:12:39.880 --> 03:12:40.880]   But what's happened,
[03:12:40.880 --> 03:12:42.240]   this is really interesting,
[03:12:42.240 --> 03:12:43.640]   over the course of the past two
[03:12:43.640 --> 03:12:45.400]   weeks just under, is that President
[03:12:45.400 --> 03:12:46.760]   Trump's approval rating,
[03:12:46.760 --> 03:12:48.560]   despite being relentlessly pounded
[03:12:48.560 --> 03:12:50.240]   by the mainstream media over this
[03:12:50.240 --> 03:12:51.720]   border enforcement issue,
[03:12:51.720 --> 03:12:53.400]   his approval rating, and this is
[03:12:53.400 --> 03:12:55.080]   real clear politics headline.
[03:12:55.080 --> 03:12:57.120]   Media failed, Trump's approval
[03:12:57.120 --> 03:12:59.480]   rating improved during manufactured
[03:12:59.480 --> 03:13:00.600]   border outrage.
[03:13:00.600 --> 03:13:02.320]   This is real clear politics.
[03:13:02.320 --> 03:13:03.320]   Average of polls,
[03:13:03.320 --> 03:13:04.520]   polls that are not even
[03:13:04.520 --> 03:13:06.240]   Rasmussen, average of polls,
[03:13:06.240 --> 03:13:07.160]   poll of polls,
[03:13:07.160 --> 03:13:09.520]   it's gone up by five points.
[03:13:09.520 --> 03:13:10.680]   That's not even Rasmussen,
[03:13:10.680 --> 03:13:11.720]   you can't claim it's got
[03:13:11.720 --> 03:13:12.560]   a Republican bias.
[03:13:12.560 --> 03:13:14.400]   This is the average of all the
[03:13:14.400 --> 03:13:16.720]   polls, his approval rating has gone
[03:13:16.720 --> 03:13:18.800]   up five points since this whole
[03:13:18.800 --> 03:13:20.960]   separating children from their
[03:13:20.960 --> 03:13:23.280]   parents scandal that was supposed
[03:13:23.280 --> 03:13:24.160]   to sink him.
[03:13:24.160 --> 03:13:26.000]   Five point improvement,
[03:13:26.000 --> 03:13:28.240]   you drill down into this poll,
[03:13:28.240 --> 03:13:30.800]   a ten point surge in support from,
[03:13:30.800 --> 03:13:33.400]   wait for it, Hispanic Americans.
[03:13:33.400 --> 03:13:35.680]   Hispanic Americans, ten point surge
[03:13:35.680 --> 03:13:38.000]   since Trump was supposedly finished
[03:13:38.000 --> 03:13:39.960]   with this big border scandal.
[03:13:39.960 --> 03:13:41.720]   His average has gone up five points
[03:13:41.720 --> 03:13:43.480]   during the establishment media's
[03:13:43.480 --> 03:13:45.240]   manufactured outrage.
[03:13:45.240 --> 03:13:46.560]   >> So the manufactured media's
[03:13:46.560 --> 03:13:48.040]   propaganda is boomeranging,
[03:13:48.040 --> 03:13:49.640]   it's backfiring is what you're
[03:13:49.640 --> 03:13:50.400]   saying, Paul.
[03:13:50.400 --> 03:13:53.080]   >> Yes, they've got no platform,
[03:13:53.080 --> 03:13:55.120]   Alex, it's just constant hysteria.
[03:13:55.120 --> 03:13:57.080]   Remember that scream helplessly at
[03:13:57.080 --> 03:13:58.720]   the sky thing from last year.
[03:13:58.720 --> 03:14:01.400]   >> [LAUGH] No.
[03:14:01.400 --> 03:14:06.400]   [SOUND] >> They're still on that,
[03:14:06.400 --> 03:14:08.480]   but then they're adding, by the way,
[03:14:08.480 --> 03:14:10.400]   start attacking Trump supporters,
[03:14:10.400 --> 03:14:11.720]   start attacking Trump.
[03:14:11.720 --> 03:14:13.720]   And then you look at another poll,
[03:14:13.720 --> 03:14:15.800]   survey finds among white millennial
[03:14:15.800 --> 03:14:17.760]   men, 23% move from Democrats to
[03:14:17.760 --> 03:14:19.840]   GOP in the last two years.
[03:14:19.840 --> 03:14:21.680]   So they already lost 9% in
[03:14:21.680 --> 03:14:23.880]   millennial votes since 2016,
[03:14:23.880 --> 03:14:25.680]   which we covered before.
[03:14:25.680 --> 03:14:27.560]   Now another new poll has found that
[03:14:27.560 --> 03:14:29.160]   white millennial men, gee,
[03:14:29.160 --> 03:14:30.960]   I wonder why white millennial men
[03:14:30.960 --> 03:14:33.200]   are shifting over to the GOP.
[03:14:33.200 --> 03:14:35.160]   When every single day the narrative
[03:14:35.160 --> 03:14:36.960]   is relentlessly, white men are to
[03:14:36.960 --> 03:14:38.200]   blame for everything.
[03:14:38.200 --> 03:14:39.600]   Toxic masculinity,
[03:14:39.600 --> 03:14:41.560]   kill all white men trending on
[03:14:41.560 --> 03:14:42.840]   Twitter.
[03:14:42.840 --> 03:14:45.400]   So a 23% shift from Dems to GOP in
[03:14:45.400 --> 03:14:46.920]   the last two years.
[03:14:46.920 --> 03:14:49.680]   Article reads the Democrats have
[03:14:49.680 --> 03:14:51.520]   been relishing their popularity
[03:14:51.520 --> 03:14:52.680]   with millennials for
[03:14:52.680 --> 03:14:53.880]   a variety of reasons.
[03:14:53.880 --> 03:14:55.880]   55% of millennials voted for
[03:14:55.880 --> 03:14:58.000]   Hillary Clinton, 33% voted for
[03:14:58.000 --> 03:14:58.520]   Trump.
[03:14:58.520 --> 03:15:00.000]   But a new poll found that
[03:15:00.000 --> 03:15:02.400]   23% have shifted even though you've
[03:15:02.400 --> 03:15:04.560]   obviously still got overwhelming
[03:15:04.560 --> 03:15:06.600]   support for the Democrats among
[03:15:06.600 --> 03:15:09.040]   white millennial men.
[03:15:09.040 --> 03:15:11.160]   It shifted big time.
[03:15:11.160 --> 03:15:13.040]   A Pew Research study also found
[03:15:13.040 --> 03:15:15.040]   that millennials gave a 64% job
[03:15:15.040 --> 03:15:17.120]   approval rating to President Obama
[03:15:17.120 --> 03:15:19.160]   but only 27 approval for Trump in
[03:15:19.160 --> 03:15:19.680]   2018.
[03:15:19.680 --> 03:15:22.080]   But this goes alongside the ICE
[03:15:22.080 --> 03:15:24.800]   poll, obviously, part of the freak
[03:15:24.800 --> 03:15:26.880]   out, part of the screaming
[03:15:26.880 --> 03:15:29.400]   helplessly at the sky is this call
[03:15:29.400 --> 03:15:31.480]   to abolish ICE, which is also
[03:15:31.480 --> 03:15:33.440]   completely unpopular with
[03:15:33.440 --> 03:15:35.120]   the American people.
[03:15:35.120 --> 03:15:37.000]   73% of swing voters oppose
[03:15:37.000 --> 03:15:39.080]   the abolition of ICE.
[03:15:39.080 --> 03:15:40.800]   This is a losing platform.
[03:15:40.800 --> 03:15:42.520]   It's just hysteria on steroids at
[03:15:42.520 --> 03:15:43.360]   this point, and
[03:15:43.360 --> 03:15:44.760]   it's going to backfire.
[03:15:44.760 --> 03:15:45.400]   It's going to fail.
[03:15:45.400 --> 03:15:46.960]   So we should be applauding them.
[03:15:46.960 --> 03:15:48.320]   We should be saying they should
[03:15:48.320 --> 03:15:49.600]   carry on with this hysterical
[03:15:49.600 --> 03:15:50.160]   rhetoric.

[03:15:59.880 --> 03:16:01.480]   Finally, someone has come out and
[03:16:01.480 --> 03:16:03.000]   written what I think is the best

[03:17:58.320 --> 03:18:00.200]   The real drama can be found here in
[03:18:00.200 --> 03:18:01.600]   Leilani Estates.
[03:18:01.600 --> 03:18:02.960]   But a lot of us on the big island
[03:18:02.960 --> 03:18:04.520]   rely on rainwater, and
[03:18:04.520 --> 03:18:06.680]   we need to be concerned about ash and
[03:18:06.680 --> 03:18:07.840]   acid rain.
[03:18:07.840 --> 03:18:10.080]   Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal
[03:18:10.080 --> 03:18:12.640]   particles, and acid rain could lower
[03:18:12.640 --> 03:18:14.480]   the pH of the water to unhealthy
[03:18:14.480 --> 03:18:15.200]   levels.
[03:18:15.200 --> 03:18:17.320]   To find out, we employed a series of
[03:18:17.320 --> 03:18:19.400]   tests for heavy metals,
[03:18:19.400 --> 03:18:21.680]   alkalinity, and pH.
[03:18:21.680 --> 03:18:22.960]   What we learned was that there was,
[03:18:22.960 --> 03:18:24.800]   in fact, unhealthy levels of heavy
[03:18:24.800 --> 03:18:27.400]   metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:18:27.400 --> 03:18:29.280]   Next, we tested the water from our
[03:18:29.280 --> 03:18:31.320]   Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[03:18:31.320 --> 03:18:32.840]   And not only were the heavy metal
[03:18:32.840 --> 03:18:35.000]   levels within safe measure, but
[03:18:35.000 --> 03:18:37.520]   the pH was also restored to optimal
[03:18:37.520 --> 03:18:38.480]   levels.
[03:18:38.480 --> 03:18:40.560]   As it turns out, the filter on
[03:18:40.560 --> 03:18:42.720]   the Alexa Pure raises the pH of
[03:18:42.720 --> 03:18:43.800]   the water.
[03:18:43.800 --> 03:18:44.840]   So what we've learned is that
[03:18:44.840 --> 03:18:47.080]   volcanic ash and acid rain can
[03:18:47.080 --> 03:18:49.440]   contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:18:49.440 --> 03:18:50.840]   But more importantly,
[03:18:50.840 --> 03:18:52.680]   a good water filtration system will
[03:18:52.680 --> 03:18:53.400]   purify it.

[03:20:38.960 --> 03:20:41.160]   an average poll headline.
[03:20:41.160 --> 03:20:43.120]   Media fail Trump's approval rating
[03:20:43.120 --> 03:20:44.800]   improved during manufactured
[03:20:44.800 --> 03:20:46.080]   border outrage.
[03:20:46.080 --> 03:20:47.680]   This is by John Nolte over at
[03:20:47.680 --> 03:20:48.320]   Breitbart.
[03:20:48.320 --> 03:20:50.800]   President Trump's job approval
[03:20:50.800 --> 03:20:52.520]   rating improved by five points
[03:20:52.520 --> 03:20:54.480]   during the establishment media's
[03:20:54.480 --> 03:20:56.280]   manufactured outrage over Trump
[03:20:56.280 --> 03:20:57.520]   continuing the Obama
[03:20:57.520 --> 03:20:59.160]   administration's policy of
[03:20:59.160 --> 03:21:01.000]   separating illegal alien adults
[03:21:01.000 --> 03:21:02.680]   from children at the border.
[03:21:02.680 --> 03:21:04.200]   Now this is real clear politics.
[03:21:04.200 --> 03:21:05.440]   This is not Rasmussen,
[03:21:05.440 --> 03:21:06.360]   which they say,
[03:21:06.360 --> 03:21:07.760]   that's Republican bias.
[03:21:07.760 --> 03:21:09.640]   Even though literally almost every
[03:21:09.640 --> 03:21:11.560]   other poll oversamples Democrats.
[03:21:11.560 --> 03:21:13.480]   But this is real clear politics,
[03:21:13.480 --> 03:21:14.400]   poll of polls.
[03:21:14.400 --> 03:21:16.440]   Trump's approval rating rounded
[03:21:16.440 --> 03:21:17.520]   out on June 8th.
[03:21:17.520 --> 03:21:19.960]   Trump's approval rating rounded out
[03:21:19.960 --> 03:21:21.600]   to an average of 42%,
[03:21:21.600 --> 03:21:23.560]   while his disapproval rating
[03:21:23.560 --> 03:21:24.760]   averaged 54%.
[03:21:24.760 --> 03:21:26.520]   So back on June 8th,
[03:21:26.520 --> 03:21:28.400]   it was a 12 point gap.
[03:21:28.400 --> 03:21:30.400]   As of Monday, July the 2nd,
[03:21:30.400 --> 03:21:32.960]   yesterday, after two weeks of being
[03:21:32.960 --> 03:21:35.240]   pounded by the entire media over
[03:21:35.240 --> 03:21:36.800]   border enforcement,
[03:21:36.800 --> 03:21:38.800]   Trump's approval rating has
[03:21:38.800 --> 03:21:40.320]   climbed to 44% and
[03:21:40.320 --> 03:21:42.960]   his disapproval rating has dropped
[03:21:42.960 --> 03:21:45.560]   to 51%, a seven point gap.
[03:21:45.560 --> 03:21:47.840]   So the margin between the two has
[03:21:47.840 --> 03:21:49.960]   improved by five points since
[03:21:49.960 --> 03:21:51.480]   this scandal.
[03:21:51.480 --> 03:21:53.200]   Since the scandal they called
[03:21:53.200 --> 03:21:55.200]   Trump's Katrina, that would sink
[03:21:55.200 --> 03:21:56.640]   his presidency again for
[03:21:56.640 --> 03:21:58.480]   the 250th time over the past 18
[03:21:58.480 --> 03:21:59.040]   months.
[03:21:59.040 --> 03:22:00.880]   And it goes on to point out that
[03:22:00.880 --> 03:22:03.040]   when you drill down into this poll,
[03:22:03.040 --> 03:22:05.120]   part of that improvement is due to
[03:22:05.120 --> 03:22:07.720]   a 10 point surge in support from
[03:22:07.720 --> 03:22:09.440]   Hispanic Americans.
[03:22:09.440 --> 03:22:11.760]   John Nolte goes on to comment,
[03:22:11.760 --> 03:22:13.360]   imagine being the establishment
[03:22:13.360 --> 03:22:14.000]   media today.
[03:22:14.000 --> 03:22:15.400]   Imagine knowing you threw
[03:22:15.400 --> 03:22:17.320]   everything you had at the president
[03:22:17.320 --> 03:22:18.960]   that you coordinated a perfect
[03:22:18.960 --> 03:22:20.840]   narrative storm using recordings
[03:22:20.840 --> 03:22:22.000]   of crying children and
[03:22:22.000 --> 03:22:23.560]   hoax photographs.
[03:22:23.560 --> 03:22:25.080]   Because obviously if there's
[03:22:25.080 --> 03:22:26.640]   an audio tape of a child crying,
[03:22:26.640 --> 03:22:28.120]   that must mean we need to raise
[03:22:28.120 --> 03:22:29.320]   the border, right, and
[03:22:29.320 --> 03:22:30.720]   get rid of all laws.
[03:22:30.720 --> 03:22:32.240]   Imagine that you poured all your
[03:22:32.240 --> 03:22:33.360]   hopes, your dreams, and
[03:22:33.360 --> 03:22:35.000]   resources into manufacturing that
[03:22:35.000 --> 03:22:36.760]   would become bulletproof story that
[03:22:36.760 --> 03:22:39.120]   would finally bring this guy down.
[03:22:39.120 --> 03:22:40.560]   And what happened in the end,
[03:22:40.560 --> 03:22:42.160]   not only is Trump in better shape
[03:22:42.160 --> 03:22:43.660]   now than before this fake news
[03:22:43.660 --> 03:22:45.480]   jihad, the public is increasingly
[03:22:45.480 --> 03:22:46.920]   siding with him on border and
[03:22:46.920 --> 03:22:48.200]   immigration issues.
[03:22:48.200 --> 03:22:50.600]   So yeah, they thought that this
[03:22:50.600 --> 03:22:52.160]   would be the one issue to sink
[03:22:52.160 --> 03:22:54.120]   Trump, it was a battle of the bulge
[03:22:54.120 --> 03:22:55.880]   all out assault by the media.
[03:22:55.880 --> 03:22:58.080]   What happened?
[03:22:58.080 --> 03:23:00.440]   Trump came out on top once again.
[03:23:00.440 --> 03:23:02.200]   This is why they seem to be just
[03:23:02.200 --> 03:23:03.800]   getting more hysterical,
[03:23:03.800 --> 03:23:05.200]   they're out of control.
[03:23:05.200 --> 03:23:07.000]   And even though it doesn't work,
[03:23:07.000 --> 03:23:08.640]   and anyone from an objective,
[03:23:08.640 --> 03:23:10.600]   neutral, a zoomed out perspective
[03:23:10.600 --> 03:23:12.000]   can see it's not working.
[03:23:12.000 --> 03:23:14.040]   It's only making swing voters more
[03:23:14.040 --> 03:23:16.360]   nervous about voting against Trump.
[03:23:16.360 --> 03:23:17.720]   Because they say, my God,
[03:23:17.720 --> 03:23:19.040]   this is the other option,
[03:23:19.040 --> 03:23:21.080]   complete hysteria, complete madcap
[03:23:21.080 --> 03:23:23.480]   behavior every single day.
[03:23:23.480 --> 03:23:25.120]   It's actually helping him.
[03:23:25.120 --> 03:23:27.040]   It's helping him in terms of white
[03:23:27.040 --> 03:23:28.480]   millennial men as well.
[03:23:28.480 --> 03:23:30.600]   As this headline out of Daily Wire
[03:23:30.600 --> 03:23:32.960]   discusses, survey finds among white
[03:23:32.960 --> 03:23:35.320]   millennial men 23% move from Dems to
[03:23:35.320 --> 03:23:37.000]   GOP in the last two years.
[03:23:37.000 --> 03:23:39.520]   So we had the millennials percentage
[03:23:39.520 --> 03:23:41.680]   shift, which we talked about a
[03:23:41.680 --> 03:23:44.400]   couple of months ago, which was 9%.
[03:23:44.400 --> 03:23:47.160]   Democrats have lost 9% millennial
[03:23:47.160 --> 03:23:49.800]   support since the 2016 election.
[03:23:49.800 --> 03:23:51.720]   Now the Guardian reports that
[03:23:51.720 --> 03:23:54.360]   a Reuters/Ipsos megapoll of 16,000
[03:23:54.360 --> 03:23:56.640]   respondents found that in the last
[03:23:56.640 --> 03:23:58.840]   two years support for Democrats
[03:23:58.840 --> 03:24:01.520]   among millennials plunged from 55 to
[03:24:01.520 --> 03:24:04.280]   46%, while support for Republicans
[03:24:04.280 --> 03:24:07.040]   has only dropped from 28% to 27%.
[03:24:07.040 --> 03:24:09.280]   So in the last two years on top of
[03:24:09.280 --> 03:24:11.800]   that, support from white millennial
[03:24:11.800 --> 03:24:14.200]   men, which of course Democrats have
[03:24:14.200 --> 03:24:16.560]   completely abandoned and basically
[03:24:16.560 --> 03:24:18.840]   blamed them for every mass shooting
[03:24:18.840 --> 03:24:21.240]   that's happened over the past year,
[03:24:21.240 --> 03:24:23.600]   has gone from the Democrats leading
[03:24:23.600 --> 03:24:25.920]   Republicans by 12%, this is again
[03:24:25.920 --> 03:24:27.800]   white millennial men, to the
[03:24:27.800 --> 03:24:30.200]   Republicans leading by 11% amongst
[03:24:30.200 --> 03:24:32.560]   them, so you've had a shift of 23%
[03:24:32.560 --> 03:24:34.800]   in support for white millennial men
[03:24:34.800 --> 03:24:37.040]   shifting from the Democrat side to
[03:24:37.040 --> 03:24:38.520]   the Republican side.
[03:24:38.520 --> 03:24:39.640]   And it's like,
[03:24:39.640 --> 03:24:41.960]   are they not reading these polls?
[03:24:41.960 --> 03:24:44.040]   Are they not reading about the fact
[03:24:44.040 --> 03:24:45.640]   that while they had a 13,
[03:24:45.640 --> 03:24:47.400]   14 point lead in the race for
[03:24:47.400 --> 03:24:49.160]   the House back in December,
[03:24:49.160 --> 03:24:51.320]   that's completely evaporated.
[03:24:51.320 --> 03:24:53.560]   So either within the margin of error
[03:24:53.560 --> 03:24:55.840]   or some polls show that Republicans
[03:24:55.840 --> 03:24:57.560]   are now ahead in the race for
[03:24:57.560 --> 03:24:59.320]   Congress in the midterms.
[03:24:59.320 --> 03:25:00.720]   I mean, are they not reading
[03:25:00.720 --> 03:25:01.480]   these polls?
[03:25:01.480 --> 03:25:03.440]   Do they just think that this endless
[03:25:03.440 --> 03:25:05.200]   wall of hysteria, this talk of
[03:25:05.200 --> 03:25:07.400]   civil war, this talk of confronting,
[03:25:07.400 --> 03:25:09.000]   getting in the face of Trump
[03:25:09.000 --> 03:25:11.160]   supporters and Trump administration
[03:25:11.160 --> 03:25:13.040]   officials, do they think that's
[03:25:13.040 --> 03:25:14.200]   actually working?
[03:25:14.200 --> 03:25:15.000]   because it isn't,
[03:25:15.000 --> 03:25:16.040]   I'm telling you right now,
[03:25:16.040 --> 03:25:16.840]   it isn't working.
[03:25:16.840 --> 03:25:18.680]   None of the polls show it's working.
[03:25:18.680 --> 03:25:20.560]   So again, I've talked about this
[03:25:20.560 --> 03:25:22.440]   before, like with the David Hogg
[03:25:22.440 --> 03:25:23.720]   issue, for example.
[03:25:23.720 --> 03:25:25.400]   People were freaking out back a
[03:25:25.400 --> 03:25:27.360]   couple of months ago, three months
[03:25:27.360 --> 03:25:28.920]   ago, about trying to counter
[03:25:28.920 --> 03:25:30.440]   David Hogg's narrative.
[03:25:30.440 --> 03:25:31.680]   You don't need to counter
[03:25:31.680 --> 03:25:32.480]   his narrative.
[03:25:32.480 --> 03:25:34.720]   He's the biggest gun salesman of
[03:25:34.720 --> 03:25:36.640]   the year, bar none, okay?
[03:25:36.640 --> 03:25:38.400]   They're shooting themselves in
[03:25:38.400 --> 03:25:39.840]   the foot at every available
[03:25:39.840 --> 03:25:41.640]   opportunity, they're scoring on
[03:25:41.640 --> 03:25:43.440]   goals, don't interrupt the enemy
[03:25:43.440 --> 03:25:45.040]   when they're making a mistake.
[03:25:45.040 --> 03:25:46.640]   And it goes straight to the ice
[03:25:46.640 --> 03:25:47.480]   issue as well.
[03:25:47.480 --> 03:25:49.520]   We've had Bernie Sanders,
[03:25:49.520 --> 03:25:52.000]   Bernie Sanders is now on the rack.
[03:25:52.000 --> 03:25:54.200]   Bernie Sanders is too right wing
[03:25:54.200 --> 03:25:56.480]   because he refuses to say that he
[03:25:56.480 --> 03:25:58.720]   wants to outright abolish ICE.
[03:25:58.720 --> 03:26:00.920]   Even as you have these hard left
[03:26:00.920 --> 03:26:03.640]   protesters occupying ICE officers,
[03:26:03.640 --> 03:26:05.880]   in some cases throwing bricks,
[03:26:05.880 --> 03:26:07.760]   throwing stones at them.
[03:26:07.760 --> 03:26:09.240]   This is a headline out of
[03:26:09.240 --> 03:26:10.240]   Daily Caller.
[03:26:10.240 --> 03:26:12.360]   Abolish ICE, vandals throw brick
[03:26:12.360 --> 03:26:14.360]   through window of GOP office,
[03:26:14.360 --> 03:26:16.080]   leave graffiti message.
[03:26:16.080 --> 03:26:17.320]   This happened yesterday,
[03:26:17.320 --> 03:26:18.720]   vandals threw a brick through
[03:26:18.720 --> 03:26:20.040]   the window of the Nebraska
[03:26:20.040 --> 03:26:21.840]   Republican Party's headquarters
[03:26:21.840 --> 03:26:23.360]   in Lincoln, Nebraska on Monday
[03:26:23.360 --> 03:26:23.800]   night.
[03:26:23.800 --> 03:26:25.560]   Again, this was abolish ICE
[03:26:25.560 --> 03:26:26.400]   protesters.
[03:26:26.400 --> 03:26:28.240]   We've had other events including
[03:26:28.240 --> 03:26:29.400]   one in Philadelphia,
[03:26:29.400 --> 03:26:31.040]   which is ongoing right now,
[03:26:31.040 --> 03:26:32.840]   last time I checked at least.
[03:26:32.840 --> 03:26:34.400]   Protests turned violent as
[03:26:34.400 --> 03:26:36.440]   demonstrators arrested in front of
[03:26:36.440 --> 03:26:38.120]   Philadelphia ICE building.
[03:26:38.120 --> 03:26:39.440]   Protests turned violent as
[03:26:39.440 --> 03:26:41.080]   activists were taken into custody
[03:26:41.080 --> 03:26:42.600]   on the streets of Philadelphia
[03:26:42.600 --> 03:26:44.200]   today, as they were calling for
[03:26:44.200 --> 03:26:45.840]   the abolishment of US Immigration
[03:26:45.840 --> 03:26:47.040]   Customs Enforcement.
[03:26:47.040 --> 03:26:49.240]   The protests taking place in front
[03:26:49.240 --> 03:26:51.440]   of the ICE office in Center City.
[03:26:51.440 --> 03:26:52.480]   So they're out,
[03:26:52.480 --> 03:26:54.040]   they're getting rowdy.
[03:26:54.040 --> 03:26:55.800]   But again, you go back to the polls,
[03:26:55.800 --> 03:26:57.120]   which none of them seem to be
[03:26:57.120 --> 03:26:57.760]   looking at.
[03:26:57.760 --> 03:26:59.680]   This is a Harvest Harris poll.
[03:26:59.680 --> 03:27:01.760]   Swing voters are overwhelmingly
[03:27:01.760 --> 03:27:03.920]   opposed to the Democrats' plan to
[03:27:03.920 --> 03:27:06.080]   end all immigration enforcement
[03:27:06.080 --> 03:27:07.120]   across the US.
[03:27:07.120 --> 03:27:09.800]   Nearly three in four swing voters,
[03:27:09.800 --> 03:27:11.080]   which is 73%,
[03:27:11.080 --> 03:27:13.320]   said they do not want ICE to be
[03:27:13.320 --> 03:27:14.320]   disbanded.
[03:27:14.320 --> 03:27:17.120]   Less than 30% of swing voters said
[03:27:17.120 --> 03:27:19.600]   they support the abolishment of
[03:27:19.600 --> 03:27:20.160]   ICE.
[03:27:20.160 --> 03:27:22.240]   It goes on to say even Democrat
[03:27:22.240 --> 03:27:24.040]   voters are opposed to the
[03:27:24.040 --> 03:27:25.440]   abolition of ICE.
[03:27:25.440 --> 03:27:27.560]   Nearly 60% of Democrats support
[03:27:27.560 --> 03:27:29.000]   the abolishment of ICE.
[03:27:29.000 --> 03:27:29.720]   That said,
[03:27:29.720 --> 03:27:31.160]   they do not want ICE to be
[03:27:31.160 --> 03:27:32.000]   disbanded.
[03:27:32.000 --> 03:27:34.280]   So again, every single poll you
[03:27:34.280 --> 03:27:36.280]   look at, these policies,
[03:27:36.280 --> 03:27:38.760]   this hysteria is not supported by
[03:27:38.760 --> 03:27:40.880]   the majority of the American
[03:27:40.880 --> 03:27:42.840]   people, or by even really a
[03:27:42.840 --> 03:27:44.800]   minority of swing voters.
[03:27:44.800 --> 03:27:46.520]   This is going to backfire on them
[03:27:46.520 --> 03:27:47.200]   horribly.
[03:27:47.200 --> 03:27:48.960]   They've lost the gap in terms of
[03:27:48.960 --> 03:27:50.560]   the massive lead they had for
[03:27:50.560 --> 03:27:52.400]   the House for the Congress race.
[03:27:52.400 --> 03:27:54.040]   And they've lost it in terms of
[03:27:54.040 --> 03:27:55.360]   white millennial men.
[03:27:55.360 --> 03:27:56.360]   And why do you think?
[03:27:56.360 --> 03:27:57.920]   Because every single day,
[03:27:57.920 --> 03:27:59.720]   the narrative is to blame white
[03:27:59.720 --> 03:28:01.000]   men for everything.
[03:28:01.000 --> 03:28:02.920]   In fact, there was a tweet about
[03:28:02.920 --> 03:28:04.880]   this where the individual put up
[03:28:04.880 --> 03:28:07.040]   this poll, 23% white millennial
[03:28:07.040 --> 03:28:08.560]   men move from Democrats to
[03:28:08.560 --> 03:28:09.480]   Republicans.
[03:28:09.480 --> 03:28:11.640]   Then he had a compilation of every
[03:28:11.640 --> 03:28:13.720]   single headline attacking white
[03:28:13.720 --> 03:28:15.480]   men as being responsible for
[03:28:15.480 --> 03:28:17.680]   literally every evil on the planet
[03:28:17.680 --> 03:28:19.360]   right next to it.
[03:28:19.360 --> 03:28:21.400]   The screenshot was literally like
[03:28:21.400 --> 03:28:23.440]   five images of condensed text that
[03:28:23.440 --> 03:28:25.040]   you would have to blow up to
[03:28:25.040 --> 03:28:26.880]   a full screen just to see every
[03:28:26.880 --> 03:28:28.480]   single instance of where
[03:28:28.480 --> 03:28:30.480]   the mainstream media, of where
[03:28:30.480 --> 03:28:32.560]   the hard left had blamed white men
[03:28:32.560 --> 03:28:34.320]   for literally every evil or
[03:28:34.320 --> 03:28:36.120]   every imagined evil in their
[03:28:36.120 --> 03:28:38.480]   hysterical worldview on the planet.
[03:28:38.480 --> 03:28:39.960]   So that's why they've lost
[03:28:39.960 --> 03:28:40.840]   that support.
[03:28:40.840 --> 03:28:42.600]   That's why they continue to lose
[03:28:42.600 --> 03:28:44.160]   support amongst everyone,
[03:28:44.160 --> 03:28:46.040]   even Hispanics to the tune of 10%
[03:28:46.040 --> 03:28:47.640]   in terms of Trump over the past
[03:28:47.640 --> 03:28:48.640]   couple of weeks.
[03:28:48.640 --> 03:28:49.480]   We'll be back.

[03:28:52.080 --> 03:28:54.480]   >> Healthcare reform is confusing.
[03:28:54.480 --> 03:28:55.880]   But whether it's finding an
[03:28:55.880 --> 03:28:57.360]   affordable insurance plan,
[03:28:57.360 --> 03:28:59.160]   keeping your doctor, or being able
[03:28:59.160 --> 03:29:00.880]   to afford needed prescriptions,
[03:29:00.880 --> 03:29:02.640]   navigating the healthcare system
[03:29:02.640 --> 03:29:03.920]   has become a challenge.

[03:31:03.240 --> 03:31:05.440]   Several years ago, I set out with
[03:31:05.440 --> 03:31:07.280]   top formulators in the US to

[03:32:59.560 --> 03:33:00.160]   Show.
[03:33:00.160 --> 03:33:13.360]   News, analysis, reports.
[03:33:13.360 --> 03:33:15.360]   It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:15.360 --> 03:33:18.960]   And now, your host, Paul Joseph
[03:33:18.960 --> 03:33:19.560]   Watson.
[03:33:19.560 --> 03:33:23.160]   We're back.
[03:33:23.160 --> 03:33:24.960]   It is the fourth hour of the Alex
[03:33:24.960 --> 03:33:25.760]   Jones Show.
[03:33:25.760 --> 03:33:27.160]   Now, there's a very interesting
[03:33:27.160 --> 03:33:28.760]   article which came out yesterday
[03:33:28.760 --> 03:33:30.360]   and it's up on InfoWars.com.
[03:33:30.360 --> 03:33:32.060]   South Koreans revolt against
[03:33:32.060 --> 03:33:33.760]   arrival of Muslim refugees.
[03:33:33.760 --> 03:33:35.560]   Now, this is not really an issue
[03:33:35.560 --> 03:33:37.360]   that you hear a lot of in terms of
[03:33:37.360 --> 03:33:39.560]   Asian countries because, of course,
[03:33:39.560 --> 03:33:40.960]   they have very limited,
[03:33:40.960 --> 03:33:42.560]   very strict immigration.
[03:33:42.560 --> 03:33:44.860]   But as soon as it came to the fore
[03:33:44.860 --> 03:33:47.360]   in terms of 1,000 asylum seekers
[03:33:47.360 --> 03:33:49.760]   from Yemen, basically turning up
[03:33:49.760 --> 03:33:52.060]   on a South Korean resort island,
[03:33:52.060 --> 03:33:54.260]   they absolutely freaked out.
[03:33:54.260 --> 03:33:56.360]   They had 520,000.
[03:33:56.360 --> 03:33:57.560]   In fact, this morning,
[03:33:57.560 --> 03:33:59.860]   it's probably closer to 600,000.
[03:33:59.860 --> 03:34:01.360]   Sign a petition, over half a
[03:34:01.360 --> 03:34:03.260]   million signed a petition asserting
[03:34:03.260 --> 03:34:04.760]   that Muslim migrants don't
[03:34:04.760 --> 03:34:06.660]   integrate, this is South Korea,
[03:34:06.660 --> 03:34:08.560]   and they don't want their country
[03:34:08.560 --> 03:34:10.960]   to end up like the UK or Germany.
[03:34:10.960 --> 03:34:12.460]   They literally had signs out on
[03:34:12.460 --> 03:34:14.060]   the street saying we don't want to
[03:34:14.060 --> 03:34:14.860]   be like Europe.
[03:34:14.860 --> 03:34:16.760]   In fact, I'm probably going to make
[03:34:16.760 --> 03:34:17.960]   a video about this and
[03:34:17.960 --> 03:34:19.360]   I'll show you those signs
[03:34:19.360 --> 03:34:20.660]   probably tomorrow.
[03:34:20.660 --> 03:34:22.360]   But again, the controversy began
[03:34:22.360 --> 03:34:23.960]   when an influx of nearly 1,000
[03:34:23.960 --> 03:34:25.360]   asylum seekers from Yemen.
[03:34:25.360 --> 03:34:27.160]   And to be fair, Yemen is in
[03:34:27.160 --> 03:34:27.960]   a civil war.
[03:34:27.960 --> 03:34:29.760]   So a lot of these people will
[03:34:29.760 --> 03:34:31.660]   genuinely be refugees, but
[03:34:31.660 --> 03:34:33.060]   some of them won't.
[03:34:33.060 --> 03:34:35.060]   Because of course, to afford to get
[03:34:35.060 --> 03:34:36.660]   a flight to South Africa from
[03:34:36.660 --> 03:34:38.460]   a country like Yemen, you have to
[03:34:38.460 --> 03:34:40.560]   be part of the middle class, really.
[03:34:40.560 --> 03:34:42.460]   You have to be of wealth simply to
[03:34:42.460 --> 03:34:44.660]   afford those travel costs.
[03:34:44.660 --> 03:34:46.360]   But they arrived on the South
[03:34:46.360 --> 03:34:48.260]   Korean resort island of Jeju,
[03:34:48.260 --> 03:34:50.260]   because basically the government
[03:34:50.260 --> 03:34:52.060]   there or the local government
[03:34:52.060 --> 03:34:54.160]   changed the rules to say you didn't
[03:34:54.160 --> 03:34:56.160]   need a visa to go there on holiday.
[03:34:56.160 --> 03:34:58.160]   So they turned up as tourists,
[03:34:58.160 --> 03:34:59.560]   around 950 of them,
[03:34:59.560 --> 03:35:01.360]   the majority from Yemen.
[03:35:01.360 --> 03:35:03.960]   Of course, now that this has got
[03:35:03.960 --> 03:35:05.560]   press attention, you will get
[03:35:05.560 --> 03:35:07.360]   others turning up as tourists and
[03:35:07.360 --> 03:35:08.960]   abusing the rules to stay.
[03:35:08.960 --> 03:35:10.960]   Because they get a one month permit
[03:35:10.960 --> 03:35:12.860]   when they arrive as tourists, but
[03:35:12.860 --> 03:35:15.260]   then they immediately claim asylum.
[03:35:15.260 --> 03:35:16.960]   And of course, that process can
[03:35:16.960 --> 03:35:18.660]   take years while they remain in
[03:35:18.660 --> 03:35:19.460]   the country.
[03:35:19.460 --> 03:35:21.460]   And as we've seen in numerous other
[03:35:21.460 --> 03:35:23.260]   European countries, a sizable
[03:35:23.260 --> 03:35:25.260]   portion of these individuals just
[03:35:25.260 --> 03:35:27.060]   disappear and you never hear from
[03:35:27.060 --> 03:35:27.760]   them again.
[03:35:27.760 --> 03:35:29.560]   So they interviewed somebody called
[03:35:29.560 --> 03:35:31.060]   Hank Kim, who was the owner of
[03:35:31.060 --> 03:35:32.560]   the core travel agency on that
[03:35:32.560 --> 03:35:34.160]   South Korean resort island.
[03:35:34.160 --> 03:35:36.160]   Basically, it's a holiday island.
[03:35:36.160 --> 03:35:37.560]   He said the local people here
[03:35:37.560 --> 03:35:38.360]   are worried.
[03:35:38.360 --> 03:35:39.960]   We have read all about the problems
[03:35:39.960 --> 03:35:41.360]   that immigrants have caused in
[03:35:41.360 --> 03:35:42.460]   Europe, in Germany and
[03:35:42.460 --> 03:35:43.560]   France in particular.
[03:35:43.560 --> 03:35:45.460]   And we do not want that to happen
[03:35:45.460 --> 03:35:45.960]   here.
[03:35:45.960 --> 03:35:47.760]   This is one of the locals there.
[03:35:47.760 --> 03:35:49.460]   And he went on to emphasize that
[03:35:49.460 --> 03:35:51.060]   the limited amount of Muslim
[03:35:51.060 --> 03:35:53.060]   immigration they've had into South
[03:35:53.060 --> 03:35:54.860]   Korea, which is very limited.
[03:35:54.860 --> 03:35:56.560]   Compared to other countries in
[03:35:56.560 --> 03:35:57.160]   Europe.
[03:35:57.160 --> 03:35:59.060]   He said they all have big families
[03:35:59.060 --> 03:36:00.860]   and they bring their own culture
[03:36:00.860 --> 03:36:02.460]   instead of trying to adapt to
[03:36:02.460 --> 03:36:03.960]   the place where they live,
[03:36:03.960 --> 03:36:05.860]   which of course we know is true.
[03:36:05.860 --> 03:36:07.960]   Ghettoization, no go zones across
[03:36:07.960 --> 03:36:10.160]   Europe, it's a common phenomenon.
[03:36:10.160 --> 03:36:11.160]   It's no longer denied.
[03:36:11.160 --> 03:36:12.560]   They once tried to claim it was
[03:36:12.560 --> 03:36:13.660]   a conspiracy theory.
[03:36:13.660 --> 03:36:15.460]   It got so bad, ambulance crews,
[03:36:15.460 --> 03:36:17.060]   firemen were being attacked,
[03:36:17.060 --> 03:36:18.660]   police were being attacked,
[03:36:18.660 --> 03:36:20.260]   cars were being set on fire.
[03:36:20.260 --> 03:36:21.960]   Now they have to admit it's a
[03:36:21.960 --> 03:36:23.860]   reality in Sweden, in Germany,
[03:36:23.860 --> 03:36:25.660]   in all these other countries.
[03:36:25.660 --> 03:36:28.060]   So South Korea does not want to be
[03:36:28.060 --> 03:36:28.860]   like that.
[03:36:28.860 --> 03:36:31.160]   So over 120,000 people signed
[03:36:31.160 --> 03:36:33.660]   a petition, it's probably closer to
[03:36:33.660 --> 03:36:36.160]   600,000 now, opposing the arrival
[03:36:36.160 --> 03:36:37.660]   of Muslim refugees.
[03:36:37.660 --> 03:36:39.660]   Then they had a protest in Seoul on
[03:36:39.660 --> 03:36:40.360]   Saturday.
[03:36:40.360 --> 03:36:42.060]   And that's from one of what I was
[03:36:42.060 --> 03:36:43.660]   talking about earlier with the
[03:36:43.660 --> 03:36:45.660]   signs, literally they were carrying
[03:36:45.660 --> 03:36:47.360]   signs that said, we don't want
[03:36:47.360 --> 03:36:49.260]   refugees, we don't want to be like
[03:36:49.260 --> 03:36:51.060]   Europe, we don't want to be like
[03:36:51.060 --> 03:36:52.560]   UK, we don't want to be like
[03:36:52.560 --> 03:36:53.160]   Germany.
[03:36:53.160 --> 03:36:54.760]   That's what those signs mean there
[03:36:54.760 --> 03:36:56.260]   that you're seeing right now in
[03:36:56.260 --> 03:36:56.760]   Korean.
[03:36:56.760 --> 03:36:58.260]   But there are also some in English
[03:36:58.260 --> 03:36:59.360]   off a different video,
[03:36:59.360 --> 03:37:00.760]   which I'm going to make a video
[03:37:00.760 --> 03:37:02.060]   about tomorrow probably.
[03:37:02.060 --> 03:37:03.560]   So they also interviewed a
[03:37:03.560 --> 03:37:05.260]   professor, a Song Jung-che,
[03:37:05.260 --> 03:37:07.160]   at the Center for Global Creation
[03:37:07.160 --> 03:37:08.860]   and Collaboration at Seoul's
[03:37:08.860 --> 03:37:10.960]   Sangmyung University, who attended
[03:37:10.960 --> 03:37:12.960]   the protest that I just mentioned.
[03:37:12.960 --> 03:37:14.660]   He said South Koreans wanted to
[03:37:14.660 --> 03:37:16.260]   avoid the same crisis that has
[03:37:16.260 --> 03:37:18.060]   befallen Europe, who opened their
[03:37:18.060 --> 03:37:19.960]   borders to, European countries who
[03:37:19.960 --> 03:37:21.360]   opened their borders to mass
[03:37:21.360 --> 03:37:22.560]   Islamic immigration.
[03:37:22.560 --> 03:37:24.360]   Quote, you've seen on television
[03:37:24.360 --> 03:37:26.060]   just how many problems are caused
[03:37:26.060 --> 03:37:27.660]   when a country like Germany or
[03:37:27.660 --> 03:37:29.560]   the UK is relaxed about immigration
[03:37:29.560 --> 03:37:32.260]   and the damage it does to societies.
[03:37:32.260 --> 03:37:33.660]   They asked him what he was talking
[03:37:33.660 --> 03:37:34.560]   about in particular.
[03:37:34.560 --> 03:37:36.060]   He mentioned pedophile grooming
[03:37:36.060 --> 03:37:37.560]   gangs, which of course are a huge
[03:37:37.560 --> 03:37:38.660]   problem across the UK.
[03:37:38.660 --> 03:37:39.860]   They're not dealt with.
[03:37:39.860 --> 03:37:40.660]   In many cases,
[03:37:40.660 --> 03:37:42.660]   they actually arrest the people who
[03:37:42.660 --> 03:37:44.060]   blow the whistle on them.
[03:37:44.060 --> 03:37:45.660]   And he mentioned terrorism as well
[03:37:45.660 --> 03:37:47.260]   as two negative side effects that
[03:37:47.260 --> 03:37:49.060]   South Korea did not want to import.
[03:37:49.060 --> 03:37:50.760]   Don't see a lot of terrorism, or
[03:37:50.760 --> 03:37:52.360]   at least Islamic terrorism in
[03:37:52.360 --> 03:37:53.660]   South Korea, do you?
[03:37:53.660 --> 03:37:55.160]   Don't see a lot of Islamic
[03:37:55.160 --> 03:37:56.460]   terrorism in Japan.
[03:37:56.460 --> 03:37:57.560]   Gee, I wonder why.
[03:37:57.560 --> 03:38:00.660]   Again, goes back to the argument
[03:38:00.660 --> 03:38:03.160]   of, well, it's just a minority.
[03:38:03.160 --> 03:38:04.960]   Yeah, it only takes a minority.
[03:38:04.960 --> 03:38:06.260]   You look at every historical
[03:38:06.260 --> 03:38:07.860]   example, it only takes a minority
[03:38:07.860 --> 03:38:09.260]   for the problems to be huge.
[03:38:09.260 --> 03:38:10.560]   That's not the argument,
[03:38:10.560 --> 03:38:11.460]   it never has been.
[03:38:11.460 --> 03:38:14.160]   Now this view that South Koreans
[03:38:14.160 --> 03:38:16.260]   share, and they're obviously racist
[03:38:16.260 --> 03:38:18.160]   for doing so, even though they're
[03:38:18.160 --> 03:38:19.760]   not white, is also shared by
[03:38:19.760 --> 03:38:21.860]   the majority of European citizens.
[03:38:21.860 --> 03:38:23.660]   We've talked about this poll before
[03:38:23.660 --> 03:38:25.060]   out of the Royal Institute of
[03:38:25.060 --> 03:38:26.760]   International Affairs, which is
[03:38:26.760 --> 03:38:28.360]   quite ironic because that's a big
[03:38:28.360 --> 03:38:30.160]   globalist group, which is probably
[03:38:30.160 --> 03:38:31.760]   pushing for mass immigration.
[03:38:31.760 --> 03:38:34.060]   55% of Europeans, if you ask across
[03:38:34.060 --> 03:38:36.060]   the country, some countries it's
[03:38:36.060 --> 03:38:38.160]   more, some countries it's less.
[03:38:38.160 --> 03:38:40.660]   But the average is 55% of European
[03:38:40.660 --> 03:38:42.760]   citizens support a total ban on
[03:38:42.760 --> 03:38:45.060]   Muslim immigration.
[03:38:45.060 --> 03:38:47.160]   A total ban tomorrow on all Muslim
[03:38:47.160 --> 03:38:49.260]   immigration, the very thing that
[03:38:49.260 --> 03:38:51.560]   Trump mooted, they suggested during
[03:38:51.560 --> 03:38:53.760]   his campaign run, is supported by
[03:38:53.760 --> 03:38:56.160]   the majority of Europeans right now.
[03:38:56.160 --> 03:38:59.460]   Now in South Korea, they had 9,942
[03:38:59.460 --> 03:39:02.160]   people apply for refugee status
[03:39:02.160 --> 03:39:05.160]   last year, this year that's doubled
[03:39:05.160 --> 03:39:07.660]   according to the new statistics
[03:39:07.660 --> 03:39:10.360]   because of programs like I mentioned
[03:39:10.360 --> 03:39:13.260]   earlier, but they only allowed 121
[03:39:13.260 --> 03:39:15.860]   people to stay to claim asylum out
[03:39:15.860 --> 03:39:17.760]   of that near 10,000.
[03:39:17.760 --> 03:39:19.960]   So unlike European countries who
[03:39:19.960 --> 03:39:22.160]   basically accept way too many on
[03:39:22.160 --> 03:39:24.360]   quite dubious merits in a lot of
[03:39:24.360 --> 03:39:26.760]   cases, South Korea is saying no.
[03:39:26.760 --> 03:39:28.760]   The people of South Korea are saying
[03:39:28.760 --> 03:39:30.560]   no, over half a million of them
[03:39:30.560 --> 03:39:32.260]   signed a petition saying no.
[03:39:32.260 --> 03:39:33.760]   And from what I've seen out of
[03:39:33.760 --> 03:39:35.260]   this story, it looks like the
[03:39:35.260 --> 03:39:36.660]   government is listening.
[03:39:36.660 --> 03:39:38.060]   They're going to cancel this
[03:39:38.060 --> 03:39:39.860]   ridiculous thing where you can just
[03:39:39.860 --> 03:39:41.560]   turn up as a tourist and then claim
[03:39:41.560 --> 03:39:43.260]   asylum on this South Korean island
[03:39:43.260 --> 03:39:45.260]   and then get shipped to the mainland.
[03:39:45.260 --> 03:39:46.860]   Looks like from the noises that
[03:39:46.860 --> 03:39:48.660]   they're making, they're going to
[03:39:48.660 --> 03:39:50.560]   stop this program and South Korea
[03:39:50.560 --> 03:39:52.060]   has said no to mass Islamic
[03:39:52.060 --> 03:39:54.060]   immigration, that's not going to be
[03:39:54.060 --> 03:39:56.060]   in the news, it was in Deutsch Well,
[03:39:56.060 --> 03:39:57.860]   which is a German publication.
[03:39:57.860 --> 03:39:59.860]   It was in I think the Korea Times.
[03:39:59.860 --> 03:40:01.860]   You don't see any discussion of this
[03:40:01.860 --> 03:40:03.660]   in a lot of big Western mainstream
[03:40:03.660 --> 03:40:05.260]   media publications, do you?
[03:40:05.260 --> 03:40:07.460]   Well, no, because they can't frame
[03:40:07.460 --> 03:40:09.760]   it as Islamophobia, they can't frame
[03:40:09.760 --> 03:40:11.760]   it as white supremacy or the far
[03:40:11.760 --> 03:40:13.760]   right because it's happening in
[03:40:13.760 --> 03:40:15.960]   South Korea, and it's happening in
[03:40:15.960 --> 03:40:17.260]   the United States.
[03:40:17.260 --> 03:40:19.260]   So South Korea, absolutely
[03:40:19.260 --> 03:40:21.260]   fascinating story.
[03:40:21.260 --> 03:40:22.360]   But again, par for
[03:40:22.360 --> 03:40:24.260]   the course when it comes to Asian
[03:40:24.260 --> 03:40:26.660]   countries, which obviously have very,
[03:40:26.660 --> 03:40:28.860]   very limited skilled immigration,
[03:40:28.860 --> 03:40:30.760]   which is what a lot of European
[03:40:30.760 --> 03:40:31.960]   countries want.
[03:40:31.960 --> 03:40:33.660]   And on that very subject,
[03:40:33.660 --> 03:40:35.860]   Italian Interior Minister Matteo
[03:40:35.860 --> 03:40:38.160]   Salvini, also anti-immigration
[03:40:38.160 --> 03:40:39.860]   alliance across Europe.
[03:40:39.860 --> 03:40:41.660]   Of course, he's the leader of
[03:40:41.660 --> 03:40:43.160]   the Lega party in Italy,
[03:40:43.160 --> 03:40:45.260]   which recently came to power, and
[03:40:45.260 --> 03:40:47.560]   is basically turning the boats back
[03:40:47.560 --> 03:40:49.960]   in Libya, stopping the taxi service,
[03:40:49.960 --> 03:40:51.860]   literally picking them up from
[03:40:51.860 --> 03:40:53.760]   10 miles off the Libyan coast.
[03:40:53.760 --> 03:40:56.060]   So he spoke to 50,000 supporters at
[03:40:56.060 --> 03:40:58.060]   the Lega Nord party conference
[03:40:58.060 --> 03:41:00.360]   recently, and said, quote, I think
[03:41:00.360 --> 03:41:02.360]   of a league of leagues in Europe,
[03:41:02.360 --> 03:41:04.460]   which unites all the free movements
[03:41:04.460 --> 03:41:06.460]   that want to defend their borders
[03:41:06.460 --> 03:41:08.860]   and the well-being of their children.
[03:41:08.860 --> 03:41:10.760]   So he's already got common cause in
[03:41:10.760 --> 03:41:12.760]   many European countries right now,
[03:41:12.760 --> 03:41:14.360]   including Poland, Austria,
[03:41:14.360 --> 03:41:17.260]   Czech Republic, the Visegrad countries.
[03:41:17.260 --> 03:41:19.060]   So there really is a split between
[03:41:19.060 --> 03:41:20.760]   the likes of Germany and France,
[03:41:20.760 --> 03:41:22.060]   old Europe, and Italy.
[03:41:22.060 --> 03:41:23.460]   And he's calling for
[03:41:23.460 --> 03:41:25.560]   that to be cemented, as we saw in
[03:41:25.560 --> 03:41:27.860]   Germany, where Merkel's Interior
[03:41:27.860 --> 03:41:30.260]   Minister basically revolted against
[03:41:30.260 --> 03:41:31.960]   her open border policies.
[03:41:31.960 --> 03:41:33.760]   It almost led to the collapse of
[03:41:33.760 --> 03:41:35.160]   Merkel's government.
[03:41:35.160 --> 03:41:36.860]   Now they've come to an agreement
[03:41:36.860 --> 03:41:38.560]   where they've basically closed
[03:41:38.560 --> 03:41:40.260]   the borders in Germany to a lot of
[03:41:40.260 --> 03:41:41.260]   these refugees.
[03:41:41.260 --> 03:41:43.260]   So everything is moving in the right
[03:41:43.260 --> 03:41:45.360]   direction in terms of border security
[03:41:45.360 --> 03:41:47.060]   and safety for a lot of European
[03:41:47.060 --> 03:41:48.860]   countries, which is why I say on
[03:41:48.860 --> 03:41:50.760]   a regular basis, a lot of good news
[03:41:50.760 --> 03:41:53.160]   coming out of Europe right now.
[03:41:53.160 --> 03:41:54.960]   Not so much good news coming out of
[03:41:54.960 --> 03:41:56.960]   Paris, which is now a complete dump.
[03:41:56.960 --> 03:41:58.960]   Thieves rip gold teeth from man's
[03:41:58.960 --> 03:42:00.660]   mouth on streets of trouble,
[03:42:00.660 --> 03:42:02.660]   Paris no-go zone.
[03:42:02.660 --> 03:42:04.660]   Remember back in, I think it was
[03:42:04.660 --> 03:42:06.460]   2015 after Charlie Hebdo,
[03:42:06.460 --> 03:42:08.760]   the mainstream media said, there are
[03:42:08.760 --> 03:42:10.160]   no no-go zones in Paris,
[03:42:10.160 --> 03:42:11.760]   what are you talking about?
[03:42:11.760 --> 03:42:13.260]   Well, a 37-year-old man was
[03:42:13.260 --> 03:42:15.160]   the victim of a brutal attack Friday
[03:42:15.160 --> 03:42:16.660]   night in a Paris suburb, and
[03:42:16.660 --> 03:42:18.360]   several people robbed him of his
[03:42:18.360 --> 03:42:19.960]   phone and ripped out four of his
[03:42:19.960 --> 03:42:20.660]   gold teeth.
[03:42:20.660 --> 03:42:23.160]   Now these teeth are worth about
[03:42:23.160 --> 03:42:26.260]   50 euros each, it's about $58.
[03:42:26.260 --> 03:42:28.260]   So they just ripped out four of his
[03:42:28.260 --> 03:42:30.160]   teeth basically so they could get
[03:42:30.160 --> 03:42:32.660]   their hands on $200 or less.
[03:42:32.660 --> 03:42:34.260]   Paris is a total dump.
[03:42:34.260 --> 03:42:36.260]   They've literally got migrants on
[03:42:36.260 --> 03:42:37.860]   the streets on mattresses,
[03:42:37.860 --> 03:42:40.160]   soaring crime, sexual assaults.
[03:42:40.160 --> 03:42:41.660]   They made the wrong decision,
[03:42:41.660 --> 03:42:43.260]   Salvini Italy made the right
[03:42:43.260 --> 03:42:44.960]   decision, and hopefully other
[03:42:44.960 --> 03:42:47.060]   European countries will do the same.
[03:42:47.060 --> 03:42:48.760]   This is the Alex Jones Show Live,

[03:49:36.060 --> 03:49:38.360]   Go for a few final news stories here.
[03:49:38.360 --> 03:49:40.260]   Now this story out of the UK,
[03:49:40.260 --> 03:49:42.560]   Westminster officials banned Trump
[03:49:42.560 --> 03:49:44.660]   from meeting Nigel Farage during
[03:49:44.660 --> 03:49:46.560]   your UK presidential visit.
[03:49:46.560 --> 03:49:48.760]   The Prime Minister's staff organizing
[03:49:48.760 --> 03:49:50.360]   next week's working visit,
[03:49:50.360 --> 03:49:52.360]   are working to prevent Trump from
[03:49:52.360 --> 03:49:54.460]   having a meeting with Brexit leader
[03:49:54.460 --> 03:49:56.460]   Nigel Farage according to claims
[03:49:56.460 --> 03:49:57.460]   made Tuesday.
[03:49:57.460 --> 03:49:59.760]   Now they've denied it, but again,
[03:49:59.760 --> 03:50:01.960]   we have a situation in the UK where
[03:50:01.960 --> 03:50:04.060]   we've got skyrocketing crime,
[03:50:04.060 --> 03:50:05.960]   stabbings, acid attacks.
[03:50:05.960 --> 03:50:07.660]   It only seems to be getting worse
[03:50:07.660 --> 03:50:09.160]   as the weather gets warmer.
[03:50:09.160 --> 03:50:10.660]   We've got a Brexit deal which
[03:50:10.660 --> 03:50:12.260]   the Conservative government,
[03:50:12.260 --> 03:50:13.760]   Conservative in name only,
[03:50:13.760 --> 03:50:15.660]   has basically betrayed, torn up and
[03:50:15.660 --> 03:50:17.560]   incinerated the democratic mandate
[03:50:17.560 --> 03:50:18.860]   of the British people.
[03:50:18.860 --> 03:50:20.360]   That's what Theresa May is
[03:50:20.360 --> 03:50:22.460]   supposed to be concentrating on.
[03:50:22.460 --> 03:50:24.160]   Instead, she's apparently,
[03:50:24.160 --> 03:50:25.660]   according to this report,
[03:50:25.660 --> 03:50:27.360]   concentrating on deciding who
[03:50:27.360 --> 03:50:29.260]   Nigel Farage can meet in his spare
[03:50:29.260 --> 03:50:29.760]   time.
[03:50:29.760 --> 03:50:32.160]   No, stick to what you were elected
[03:50:32.160 --> 03:50:34.260]   for, stick to what we voted for
[03:50:34.260 --> 03:50:35.660]   back two years ago.
[03:50:35.660 --> 03:50:37.960]   Stop pussyfooting around deciding
[03:50:37.960 --> 03:50:39.360]   what Nigel Farage and
[03:50:39.360 --> 03:50:40.960]   Donald Trump get up to.
[03:50:40.960 --> 03:50:42.560]   None of your business.
[03:50:42.560 --> 03:50:44.460]   Donald Trump can meet whoever
[03:50:44.460 --> 03:50:46.560]   the hell he wants while he's here
[03:50:46.560 --> 03:50:48.560]   in his own spare private time.
[03:50:48.560 --> 03:50:50.560]   Meanwhile, Cameron personally
[03:50:50.560 --> 03:50:52.760]   requested Obama's back of the queue
[03:50:52.760 --> 03:50:53.860]   Brexit warning.
[03:50:53.860 --> 03:50:55.860]   Former key aide to Barack Obama has
[03:50:55.860 --> 03:50:57.360]   confirmed David Cameron,
[03:50:57.360 --> 03:50:59.360]   former Prime Minister of Britain,
[03:50:59.360 --> 03:51:01.060]   of course, personally asked
[03:51:01.060 --> 03:51:02.860]   the US President to warn Britain
[03:51:02.860 --> 03:51:04.460]   would be back of the queue for
[03:51:04.460 --> 03:51:05.960]   a post Brexit trade deal.
[03:51:05.960 --> 03:51:07.860]   Ben Rhodes, an ex White House
[03:51:07.860 --> 03:51:09.360]   advisor, admitted Mr.
[03:51:09.360 --> 03:51:11.560]   Obama's dramatic intervention in
[03:51:11.560 --> 03:51:13.760]   the EU referendum campaign came at
[03:51:13.760 --> 03:51:15.960]   the personal request of the former
[03:51:15.960 --> 03:51:17.060]   Prime Minister.
[03:51:17.060 --> 03:51:19.060]   Which of course happened in April
[03:51:19.060 --> 03:51:20.960]   2016, just two months before
[03:51:20.960 --> 03:51:22.860]   the Brexit vote where Obama gave
[03:51:22.860 --> 03:51:24.860]   the speech and said the UK is going
[03:51:24.860 --> 03:51:26.660]   to be at the back of the queue.
[03:51:26.660 --> 03:51:28.460]   Well, it turns out that wasn't
[03:51:28.460 --> 03:51:30.160]   the case, because you lost,
[03:51:30.160 --> 03:51:31.560]   Hillary Clinton lost.
[03:51:31.560 --> 03:51:33.560]   But again, what does this tell us?
[03:51:33.560 --> 03:51:35.760]   Foreign meddling, interfering with
[03:51:35.760 --> 03:51:37.360]   the democratic process,
[03:51:37.360 --> 03:51:39.760]   that's literally what we have here.
[03:51:39.760 --> 03:51:41.860]   Actual proof of a foreign power
[03:51:41.860 --> 03:51:43.660]   meddling in our sovereign
[03:51:43.660 --> 03:51:45.160]   democratic process.
[03:51:45.160 --> 03:51:47.460]   Not talking about Russian collusion,
[03:51:47.460 --> 03:51:49.360]   I'm talking about Barack Obama
[03:51:49.360 --> 03:51:51.260]   scheming with David Cameron to
[03:51:51.260 --> 03:51:53.260]   meddle in our democratic process
[03:51:53.260 --> 03:51:55.260]   in the UK when it came to Brexit.
[03:51:55.260 --> 03:51:57.560]   Bombshell admitted proof of
[03:51:57.560 --> 03:51:59.260]   foreign collusion,
[03:51:59.260 --> 03:52:01.760]   is anybody talking about that?
[03:52:01.760 --> 03:52:04.260]   No, no, nobody's talking about it,
[03:52:04.260 --> 03:52:06.560]   they're still talking about this
[03:52:06.560 --> 03:52:08.360]   Mueller investigation.
[03:52:08.360 --> 03:52:10.460]   Admitted proof of foreign collusion
[03:52:10.460 --> 03:52:12.360]   right there, bang in your face.
[03:52:12.360 --> 03:52:14.360]   Meanwhile, the US President
[03:52:14.360 --> 03:52:16.660]   meanwhile, talking about Trump and
[03:52:16.660 --> 03:52:18.860]   this ties into Trump because we've
[03:52:18.860 --> 03:52:20.860]   got his visit next week in the UK,
[03:52:20.860 --> 03:52:22.960]   not an official state visit because
[03:52:22.960 --> 03:52:25.260]   basically the conservative government
[03:52:25.260 --> 03:52:27.260]   is scared that everyone will freak
[03:52:27.260 --> 03:52:29.360]   out which they will because they're
[03:52:29.360 --> 03:52:31.760]   complete idiots, there'll be protests.
[03:52:31.760 --> 03:52:33.460]   There may indeed be small scale
[03:52:33.460 --> 03:52:35.460]   riots, but over in Turkey this ties
[03:52:35.460 --> 03:52:37.660]   into it, Istanbul police shoot rubber
[03:52:37.660 --> 03:52:39.660]   bullets and tear gas, sick dogs on
[03:52:39.660 --> 03:52:41.560]   gay pride marches in Istanbul.
[03:52:41.560 --> 03:52:43.560]   So they banned the gay pride march
[03:52:43.560 --> 03:52:45.560]   again, the 16th annual gay pride
[03:52:45.560 --> 03:52:47.460]   march like they did for the past
[03:52:47.460 --> 03:52:49.560]   four years in Istanbul, Turkey.
[03:52:49.560 --> 03:52:52.260]   It attracted 100,000 people in 2014,
[03:52:52.260 --> 03:52:54.760]   this year 10,000 people showed up.
[03:52:54.760 --> 03:52:56.960]   In fact, only 1,000 showed up.
[03:52:56.960 --> 03:52:58.060]   And what did they do?
[03:52:58.060 --> 03:52:59.060]   They used tear gas,
[03:52:59.060 --> 03:53:00.360]   they used rubber bullets,
[03:53:00.360 --> 03:53:02.060]   they used dogs to try to disperse
[03:53:02.060 --> 03:53:02.860]   the crowd.
[03:53:02.860 --> 03:53:05.060]   Erdogan's thugs also brought out
[03:53:05.060 --> 03:53:07.260]   the police dogs, they broke it up.
[03:53:07.260 --> 03:53:08.660]   Basically pointed guns at
[03:53:08.660 --> 03:53:09.660]   the protesters.
[03:53:09.660 --> 03:53:11.660]   The video's over at Gateway Pundit
[03:53:11.660 --> 03:53:13.360]   if you want to watch it,
[03:53:13.360 --> 03:53:15.760]   who's going to be protesting that?
[03:53:15.760 --> 03:53:19.260]   Nobody, is the LGBT lobby in London
[03:53:19.260 --> 03:53:21.060]   going to march on the Turkish
[03:53:21.060 --> 03:53:22.460]   embassy in London?
[03:53:22.460 --> 03:53:24.360]   No, they're not, they're going to
[03:53:24.360 --> 03:53:26.460]   be protesting against Donald Trump,
[03:53:26.460 --> 03:53:28.260]   a guy who literally appoints gay
[03:53:28.260 --> 03:53:30.360]   people to high positions of influence
[03:53:30.360 --> 03:53:32.460]   within his administration, as we saw
[03:53:32.460 --> 03:53:34.160]   with the ambassador a couple of
[03:53:34.160 --> 03:53:34.960]   months ago.
[03:53:34.960 --> 03:53:36.860]   They're going to be protesting the
[03:53:36.860 --> 03:53:38.760]   guy who literally waves a rainbow
[03:53:38.760 --> 03:53:40.860]   flag around on stage, which happened
[03:53:40.860 --> 03:53:42.060]   during his campaign.
[03:53:42.060 --> 03:53:43.660]   Are they going to be protesting
[03:53:43.660 --> 03:53:45.060]   against the government,
[03:53:45.060 --> 03:53:46.760]   against the police system that
[03:53:46.760 --> 03:53:48.760]   persecutes gays on a regular basis,
[03:53:48.760 --> 03:53:50.360]   that fires tear gas at them,
[03:53:50.360 --> 03:53:52.260]   that fires rubber bullets at them,
[03:53:52.260 --> 03:53:54.060]   that six dogs are at them, simply
[03:53:54.060 --> 03:53:55.960]   for trying to get out on the streets
[03:53:55.960 --> 03:53:57.060]   and have a parade?
[03:53:57.060 --> 03:53:58.760]   No, they don't give a damn about
[03:53:58.760 --> 03:54:00.560]   that, they give a damn about Trump
[03:54:00.560 --> 03:54:01.860]   because they've got Trump
[03:54:01.860 --> 03:54:03.160]   derangement syndrome.
[03:54:03.160 --> 03:54:04.760]   They're told what to think.
[03:54:04.760 --> 03:54:06.660]   Nobody's going to be protesting
[03:54:06.660 --> 03:54:08.760]   anti-gay persecution of people in
[03:54:08.760 --> 03:54:09.960]   Istanbul, Turkey.
[03:54:09.960 --> 03:54:11.860]   Nobody's going to be marching on
[03:54:11.860 --> 03:54:13.060]   the Saudi embassy.
[03:54:13.060 --> 03:54:15.060]   Nobody's going to be marching on
[03:54:15.060 --> 03:54:16.960]   the Turkish embassy, complete
[03:54:16.960 --> 03:54:18.960]   hypocrisy through and through.
[03:54:18.960 --> 03:54:20.760]   Another story out of Breitbart
[03:54:20.760 --> 03:54:21.760]   here, in fact,
[03:54:21.760 --> 03:54:23.760]   we've got a clip that we can play.
[03:54:23.760 --> 03:54:25.960]   This is the Polish lawmaker clip,
[03:54:25.960 --> 03:54:27.760]   where he basically takes on
[03:54:27.760 --> 03:54:29.460]   Cathy Newman, her of, so
[03:54:29.460 --> 03:54:31.360]   what you're saying is fame,
[03:54:31.360 --> 03:54:33.560]   with Jordan Peterson, the living
[03:54:33.560 --> 03:54:35.160]   meme, he takes her on.
[03:54:35.160 --> 03:54:37.160]   Again, she tries to guilt trip him
[03:54:37.160 --> 03:54:38.660]   for the fact that Poland has
[03:54:38.660 --> 03:54:40.860]   an accepted huge swaths of refugees
[03:54:40.860 --> 03:54:42.860]   and she comes off second best.
[03:54:42.860 --> 03:54:43.960]   Let's go to this clip.
[03:54:43.960 --> 03:54:45.160]   >> Let me just ask Mr.
[03:54:45.160 --> 03:54:48.160]   Tuchinsky, how many refugees has
[03:54:48.160 --> 03:54:49.560]   Poland taken?
[03:54:49.560 --> 03:54:51.360]   >> Zero.
[03:54:51.360 --> 03:54:53.360]   >> And you're proud of that?
[03:54:53.360 --> 03:54:56.060]   >> If you are asking me about
[03:54:56.060 --> 03:54:59.560]   Muslims' illegal immigration,
[03:54:59.560 --> 03:55:02.560]   none, not even one will come to
[03:55:02.560 --> 03:55:05.560]   Poland, not even one if it's
[03:55:05.560 --> 03:55:08.060]   illegal, we treat them as
[03:55:08.060 --> 03:55:09.060]   refugees.
[03:55:09.060 --> 03:55:11.060]   We took over 2 million Ukrainians
[03:55:11.060 --> 03:55:12.060]   who are working,
[03:55:12.060 --> 03:55:13.660]   who are peaceful in Poland.
[03:55:13.660 --> 03:55:15.160]   We will not receive even one
[03:55:15.160 --> 03:55:16.760]   Muslim because this is what we
[03:55:16.760 --> 03:55:17.460]   promised.
[03:55:17.460 --> 03:55:19.160]   >> But I asked not about illegal
[03:55:19.160 --> 03:55:20.760]   immigrants, I asked about
[03:55:20.760 --> 03:55:22.560]   refugees, and Junko Junko,
[03:55:22.560 --> 03:55:24.160]   the commission president,
[03:55:24.160 --> 03:55:25.760]   says that you're racist.
[03:55:25.760 --> 03:55:27.660]   You sound proud of the fact that
[03:55:27.660 --> 03:55:29.660]   you haven't taken any refugees.
[03:55:29.660 --> 03:55:31.860]   >> Of course, because this is what
[03:55:31.860 --> 03:55:33.860]   our people expecting from our
[03:55:33.860 --> 03:55:36.360]   government, that's number one.
[03:55:36.360 --> 03:55:38.560]   This is why our government was
[03:55:38.560 --> 03:55:39.660]   elected, but
[03:55:39.660 --> 03:55:41.960]   this is why Poland is so safe.
[03:55:41.960 --> 03:55:44.560]   This is the reason why we have not
[03:55:44.560 --> 03:55:46.860]   even one terrorist attack.
[03:55:46.860 --> 03:55:49.160]   Look at the streets in Poland and
[03:55:49.160 --> 03:55:51.160]   we can be called populists,
[03:55:51.160 --> 03:55:53.660]   nationalists, racists, I don't
[03:55:53.660 --> 03:55:55.960]   care, I care about my family and
[03:55:55.960 --> 03:55:57.360]   about my country.
[03:55:57.360 --> 03:55:59.060]   >> Not many terrorist attacks in
[03:55:59.060 --> 03:56:00.860]   Poland, not many giant grooming
[03:56:00.860 --> 03:56:02.560]   gangs sweeping the country in
[03:56:02.560 --> 03:56:03.760]   Poland, are there?
[03:56:03.760 --> 03:56:05.560]   That's interesting, isn't it?
[03:56:05.560 --> 03:56:07.160]   And of course the media, and
[03:56:07.160 --> 03:56:08.860]   in that case, Kathy Newman,
[03:56:08.860 --> 03:56:10.660]   used the term refugees when they
[03:56:10.660 --> 03:56:12.760]   know, they know that even according
[03:56:12.760 --> 03:56:14.260]   to the UN's own figures,
[03:56:14.260 --> 03:56:16.160]   the vast majority of these people
[03:56:16.160 --> 03:56:17.860]   who they call refugees are not
[03:56:17.860 --> 03:56:19.560]   refugees, they're economic
[03:56:19.560 --> 03:56:20.260]   migrants.
[03:56:20.260 --> 03:56:21.760]   They can only afford to pay the
[03:56:21.760 --> 03:56:23.260]   criminal people smugglers in
[03:56:23.260 --> 03:56:25.060]   the first place because they've at
[03:56:25.060 --> 03:56:26.860]   least got some wealth within their
[03:56:26.860 --> 03:56:28.360]   own countries, they're not
[03:56:28.360 --> 03:56:30.160]   refugees, they're trying to flee
[03:56:30.160 --> 03:56:31.860]   to the European welfare states.
[03:56:31.860 --> 03:56:33.460]   And in fact, in the process,
[03:56:33.460 --> 03:56:35.060]   harming their own countries,
[03:56:35.060 --> 03:56:36.460]   some of them are essentially
[03:56:36.460 --> 03:56:37.760]   middle class within those
[03:56:37.760 --> 03:56:39.460]   countries, and they're fleeing,
[03:56:39.460 --> 03:56:41.260]   absolutely incredible situation.
[03:56:41.260 --> 03:56:42.860]   But the resistance against it is
[03:56:42.860 --> 03:56:44.460]   building, here's a story out of
[03:56:44.460 --> 03:56:46.060]   Germany, thousands of Germans
[03:56:46.060 --> 03:56:47.460]   protest against Merkel and
[03:56:47.460 --> 03:56:48.760]   migration in Cottbus.
[03:56:48.760 --> 03:56:50.760]   After several migrant related
[03:56:50.760 --> 03:56:52.360]   incidents, people of Cottbus took
[03:56:52.360 --> 03:56:53.860]   to the streets Sunday to protest
[03:56:53.860 --> 03:56:55.660]   against Merkel's migration policy.
[03:56:55.660 --> 03:56:57.460]   German community organization
[03:56:57.460 --> 03:56:59.460]   processes throughout the city with
[03:56:59.460 --> 03:57:01.160]   demonstrators calling out,
[03:57:01.160 --> 03:57:02.360]   Merkel must leave,
[03:57:02.360 --> 03:57:04.260]   we are the people, and deport.
[03:57:05.060 --> 03:57:06.660]   So there are huge protests going on
[03:57:06.660 --> 03:57:07.560]   against this.
[03:57:07.560 --> 03:57:09.360]   We have the situation in Italy with
[03:57:09.360 --> 03:57:10.460]   Salvini where him and
[03:57:10.460 --> 03:57:11.760]   the Five Star Movement,
[03:57:11.760 --> 03:57:13.260]   the coalition government,
[03:57:13.260 --> 03:57:14.460]   are hugely popular for
[03:57:14.460 --> 03:57:16.460]   instituting these measures whereby
[03:57:16.460 --> 03:57:18.060]   they at least have some sense of
[03:57:18.060 --> 03:57:19.960]   border security and sovereignty.
[03:57:19.960 --> 03:57:21.660]   The populist wave is sweeping
[03:57:21.660 --> 03:57:23.660]   Europe, you cannot stop it at this
[03:57:23.660 --> 03:57:25.660]   point by merely invoking the words
[03:57:25.660 --> 03:57:28.060]   racist, or populist, or nationalist.
[03:57:28.060 --> 03:57:29.860]   It doesn't work, people have
[03:57:29.860 --> 03:57:31.760]   rejected your globalism, and
[03:57:31.760 --> 03:57:33.560]   that rejection is not going to
[03:57:33.560 --> 03:57:35.460]   build, and that rejection is only
[03:57:35.460 --> 03:57:36.460]   going to build.
[03:57:36.460 --> 03:57:37.660]   I was going to wrap it up for
[03:57:37.660 --> 03:57:39.160]   the fourth hour of the Alex Jones
[03:57:39.160 --> 03:57:40.860]   show, War Room with Owen Schroer is
[03:57:40.860 --> 03:57:42.460]   coming up live, infowars.com.
[03:57:42.460 --> 03:57:44.260]   >> This 4th of July is special,
[03:57:44.260 --> 03:57:45.560]   everybody can see it,
[03:57:45.560 --> 03:57:46.660]   they can feel it.
[03:57:46.660 --> 03:57:48.460]   The globalists are attempting to
[03:57:48.460 --> 03:57:50.460]   kill a worldwide awakening to their
[03:57:50.460 --> 03:57:52.460]   tyranny, and America, yet again,
[03:57:52.460 --> 03:57:54.360]   is at the heart of the resistance,
[03:57:54.360 --> 03:57:55.460]   the globalists.
[03:57:55.460 --> 03:57:56.960]   That's why this 4th of July,
[03:57:56.960 --> 03:57:58.360]   I'm asking all of our great
[03:57:58.360 --> 03:58:00.260]   supporters to think about InfoWars
[03:58:00.260 --> 03:58:01.360]   now more than ever.
[03:58:01.360 --> 03:58:02.960]   And what would the world be like if
[03:58:02.960 --> 03:58:04.560]   InfoWars wasn't there resisting
[03:58:04.560 --> 03:58:05.460]   the globalists?
[03:58:05.460 --> 03:58:06.760]   What would have happened if you
[03:58:06.760 --> 03:58:08.060]   hadn't supported InfoWars?
[03:58:08.060 --> 03:58:09.560]   We would not be having the victories
[03:58:09.560 --> 03:58:10.260]   we have today.
[03:58:10.260 --> 03:58:11.660]   So yes, a lot of good things are
[03:58:11.660 --> 03:58:13.160]   happening, but the enemy is striking
[03:58:13.160 --> 03:58:14.560]   back, so please, think about
[03:58:14.560 --> 03:58:16.160]   InfoWars and funding our operation
[03:58:16.160 --> 03:58:17.760]   while you get great products at the
[03:58:17.760 --> 03:58:19.360]   same time on this 4th of July that's
[03:58:19.360 --> 03:58:20.060]   so historic.
[03:58:20.060 --> 03:58:22.060]   We have record sales going on right
[03:58:22.060 --> 03:58:24.060]   now, free shipping on hundreds of

[03:58:39.160 --> 03:58:40.860]   This 4th of July is special, and
[03:58:40.860 --> 03:58:42.660]   our sales are special to match it,

[03:58:43.960 --> 03:58:45.660]   >> Do you realize that when you
[03:58:45.660 --> 03:58:47.960]   spread the links from InfoWars.com,
[03:58:47.960 --> 03:58:49.660]   when you spread the videos,
[03:58:49.660 --> 03:58:51.460]   you are changing the world?
[03:58:51.460 --> 03:58:53.760]   It's you that has defeated Hillary
[03:58:53.760 --> 03:58:55.160]   and the globalists.
[03:58:55.160 --> 03:58:57.160]   It is you, the InfoWarriors across
[03:58:57.160 --> 03:58:58.960]   the planet, that stood against
[03:58:58.960 --> 03:59:00.860]   the bullying, that stood against
[03:59:00.860 --> 03:59:02.560]   the peer pressure, that stood
[03:59:02.560 --> 03:59:04.460]   against the threats that have now
[03:59:04.460 --> 03:59:05.660]   changed the world.
[03:59:05.660 --> 03:59:07.160]   And that's why you've been on
[03:59:07.160 --> 03:59:08.960]   the team, supporting us, praying
[03:59:08.960 --> 03:59:10.760]   for us, and spreading the word.
[03:59:10.760 --> 03:59:11.960]   You are the InfoWar.
[03:59:11.960 --> 03:59:13.260]   And now because of their
[03:59:13.260 --> 03:59:15.160]   intensifying censorship, it's more
[03:59:15.160 --> 03:59:16.960]   important than ever that everyone
[03:59:16.960 --> 03:59:18.860]   go to InfoWars.com/newsletter and
[03:59:18.860 --> 03:59:19.960]   sign up via email.
[03:59:19.960 --> 03:59:21.760]   So there's no way the censors can
[03:59:21.760 --> 03:59:23.360]   get between us with critical
[03:59:23.360 --> 03:59:25.260]   videos, articles, breaking news,
[03:59:25.260 --> 03:59:26.460]   intel, you name it.
[03:59:26.460 --> 03:59:28.060]   And so now I ask you more than
[03:59:28.060 --> 03:59:29.860]   ever to share the InfoWars.com
[03:59:29.860 --> 03:59:31.460]   articles, to share the videos,
[03:59:31.460 --> 03:59:33.060]   to tell people about the local
[03:59:33.060 --> 03:59:34.760]   stations you're listening to.
[03:59:34.760 --> 03:59:36.460]   The bare minimum you can do is
[03:59:36.460 --> 03:59:38.260]   sign up for the free newsletter
[03:59:38.260 --> 03:59:41.160]   at InfoWars.com/newsletter.
[03:59:41.160 --> 03:59:42.960]   We are the Renaissance, and
[03:59:42.960 --> 03:59:44.060]   we are winning.
[03:59:44.060 --> 03:59:48.360]   >> You're listening to
[03:59:48.360 --> 03:59:49.660]   The Alex Jones Show.
