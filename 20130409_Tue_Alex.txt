[01:05.200 --> 01:11.600]  year a decade ago and if you study history and project in with future
[01:11.600 --> 01:16.680]  trends moving towards what the establishment calls the singularity you
[01:16.680 --> 01:23.000]  will see more change in a week and say a decade from now that we've already seen
[01:23.000 --> 01:29.480]  in the last ten years and so it's all just going to get more and more insane

[02:19.480 --> 02:25.080]  to go fly around and detect American gun owners and they've got a local Oklahoma

[02:39.120 --> 02:43.720]  and and I've got them doing another article right now Obama has been caught
[02:43.720 --> 02:50.000]  in a gigantic humongous line saying that ninety percent of people support more
[02:50.000 --> 02:54.400]  gun control when there is no poll showing that even the fake CBS polls and
[02:54.400 --> 02:58.920]  Gallup polls and public policy polls and stuff show fifty percent or less
[02:58.920 --> 03:04.440]  factors some of the headlines NPR the hill you name it
[03:04.440 --> 03:11.000]  poll support for new gun control drops by double digit margins here's another
[03:11.000 --> 03:14.960]  one NRA winning the influence battle over gun control Forbes with the actual
[03:14.960 --> 03:19.200]  data mining it shows it's backfired on them the opposite of actually getting
[03:19.200 --> 03:25.760]  people on board what a spectacle Obama using those dead kids and rolling out
[03:25.760 --> 03:31.320]  the parents saying America it's your fault this happened restrict your guns
[03:31.320 --> 03:37.080]  no parents you took your children to a government training center advertised as
[03:37.080 --> 03:43.080]  a mass shooting facility and you're the ones globalist and supporters of it that
[03:43.080 --> 03:47.840]  are supporting all the mentally ill people on the psychotropics in almost
[03:47.840 --> 03:53.160]  every case they're on them and then you want to point at me in my life with no
[03:53.160 --> 03:59.040]  criminal record in areas with crime rates incredibly low compared to areas
[03:59.040 --> 04:03.920]  where they restricted guns and lecture me with a bunch of guilt
[04:06.480 --> 04:10.200]  that I better get on with your agenda or I'm a bad person it's like go along with
[04:10.200 --> 04:12.040]  social health care or you're a racist
[04:12.040 --> 04:15.360]  well I'm a racist then you gotta call the bluff of the politically correct
[04:15.360 --> 04:17.640]  people because they're not really politically correct they're not really
[04:17.640 --> 04:21.960]  liberals they're cold-blooded Lee using these tragedies and using these poor
[04:21.960 --> 04:27.720]  parents so obviously it should be back on the government why have you made
[04:27.720 --> 04:31.240]  schools gun-free zones because bad guys are going to bring guns wherever they

[09:29.760 --> 09:33.320]  put hundreds of vaccines in them and and they don't like America being run by a
[09:33.320 --> 09:36.980]  foreign New World Order and worst of all they had an info wars calm bumper

[10:47.680 --> 10:52.880]  and I agree with MSNBC there is no private children they belong to the
[10:52.880 --> 10:57.400]  state and we've got a FEMA Corps and we've got clergy response teams state
[10:57.400 --> 11:01.400]  run churches that's a great sign of a free country that doesn't violate the
[11:01.400 --> 11:07.320]  First Amendment of course it does just incredible just incredible to have that
[11:07.320 --> 11:12.280]  type of stuff going on all right ladies and gentlemen we're gonna get into Obama
[11:12.280 --> 11:19.360]  pimping out the dead children of Connecticut as saying hey you know do
[11:19.360 --> 11:24.280]  this for the families restrict your guns and this is what 90% of Americans want a
[11:24.280 --> 11:30.180]  total and complete lie we're gonna break that down here in just a moment and I
[11:30.180 --> 11:35.000]  was driving home last night at about 8 o'clock at about 8 o'clock listening to
[11:35.000 --> 11:43.720]  MSNBC no CNBC on XM monitoring globalist propaganda and I was listening and they
[11:43.720 --> 11:51.440]  said coming up next the president in Newtown Connecticut and then flying the
[11:51.440 --> 12:00.280]  families back for a rally in DC but what did the pro-gun people do they snub the
[12:00.280 --> 12:06.320]  parents and the commentator goes oh come on you didn't do that and then they cut
[12:06.320 --> 12:12.040]  to Obama I mean just unbelievable foreign banks have captured the federal
[12:12.040 --> 12:16.480]  government most the states they're taking 85 billion dollars a month of
[12:16.480 --> 12:20.440]  your taxpayer money and giving it to foreign banks and telling Congress who
[12:20.440 --> 12:24.920]  gets it specifically a secret they are erecting all sorts of police state
[12:24.920 --> 12:29.740]  systems FEMA camps the emergency centers establishment act the civilian inmate
[12:29.740 --> 12:35.200]  labor camp program these are all declassified they are training Fox News
[12:35.200 --> 12:42.640]  headline Christians listed as extremists next to al-qaeda Catholics evangelicals
[12:42.640 --> 12:46.080]  what's wrong with evangelicals they've called for turning our guns in and they
[12:46.080 --> 12:49.680]  were in the news today saying total amnesty total open borders well that
[12:49.680 --> 12:56.560]  isn't enough you are a terrorist I mean this is the over-the-top stuff imagine
[12:56.560 --> 13:01.640]  people got in a time machine from the 1950s and teleported here and turned on
[13:01.640 --> 13:08.160]  MSNBC where they're saying fathers are bad the state runs our children five
[13:08.160 --> 13:11.800]  year olds need to be taught how to masturbate in school the borders need to
[13:11.800 --> 13:17.000]  be open it's your fault somebody went to a gun-free zone and killed people we're
[13:17.000 --> 13:20.520]  bringing in world government there are no drones but we're launching drones I
[13:20.520 --> 13:24.960]  mean this is the type of craziness we have an article up at info Wars calm
[13:24.960 --> 13:34.080]  right now look at these headlines big sis testing drones that can detect guns
[13:34.800 --> 13:41.920]  big sis testing drones that can detect guns and this is officially Homeland

[13:46.600 --> 13:50.560]  training to detect guns and it's part of the governor's council there in the
[13:50.560 --> 13:55.000]  state to launch these vehicles Obama demands a vote on Second Amendment
[13:55.000 --> 14:03.600]  during Hartford speech police confiscate man's guns over son's water pistol
[14:03.600 --> 14:09.960]  threat reportedly bullies were beating up the kids so they joked around and
[14:09.960 --> 14:13.760]  said we ought to get our water guns and squirt them show the dad had his guns
[14:13.760 --> 14:17.720]  taken because his ten-year-old allegedly said that no judge no jury no nothing
[14:17.720 --> 14:23.040]  the guns are locked up in a safe it's up there in Long Island but that wasn't
[14:23.040 --> 14:26.760]  enough and the police the the the father said when do I get my guns back is well
[14:26.760 --> 14:30.800]  your son's ten when he's 18 if we come to a home inspection and prove he's
[14:30.800 --> 14:34.600]  moved out but he's not allowed in your house either then you can have your guns
[14:34.600 --> 14:40.720]  back no judge no jury no warrant no nothing just martial law and that's what
[14:40.720 --> 14:45.680]  knocking talks been under federal grants for 15 years from Dallas Texas to Boston
[14:45.680 --> 14:49.200]  Massachusetts the police come to your house and say knock knock in nice
[14:49.200 --> 14:51.880]  neighborhoods by the way cuz they can do it there they do anywhere we like to
[14:51.880 --> 14:57.320]  come in and inspect your firearms and I've played newscast here in Boston
[14:57.320 --> 15:02.560]  where they actually force their way in without warrants just door-to-door and
[15:02.560 --> 15:07.280]  that's what gun buybacks are for the image on the news of people handing guns
[15:07.280 --> 15:12.040]  in it's all part of the conditioning and all the Hollywood movies where they show
[15:12.040 --> 15:17.080]  oh my gosh this guy's got a gun in his house you know the cops break into the
[15:17.080 --> 15:20.280]  house without a warrant because they got to save the kids they find little kids
[15:20.280 --> 15:23.800]  you know dead in the basement look at this guy he's an NRA member there's
[15:23.800 --> 15:27.320]  nothing worse than those scum it'll show an NRA sticker on the wall that's an
[15:27.320 --> 15:32.600]  actual TV show I covered years ago and they'll go yeah it's just despicable
[15:32.600 --> 15:37.520]  he's got illegal guns and he'll show up shotgun which isn't even legal except in
[15:37.520 --> 15:43.120]  New York or Chicago in the cities but again it's just put out there guns are
[15:43.120 --> 15:47.560]  illegal guns are illegal it's like guns of the new n-word or something this is
[15:47.560 --> 15:53.360]  this is all part of the political correctness yeah there it is Washington
[15:53.360 --> 15:58.760]  gun bill in includes police searches without warrants boom Seattle post
[15:58.760 --> 16:04.160]  intelligence sir reported on that a few weeks ago they're not playing games
[16:04.160 --> 16:11.560]  they're not playing games and then of course the big news of the day ladies
[16:11.560 --> 16:14.760]  and gentlemen North Korea to launch missile tomorrow after warning foreigners
[16:14.760 --> 16:19.760]  to evacuate the south I want to comment on this at the bottom of the hour but
[16:19.760 --> 16:26.760]  right now let's start analyzing the incredible lies of Obama flying the
[16:26.760 --> 16:31.160]  Newtown families around and and on every news channel you've heard it you've seen
[16:31.160 --> 16:36.560]  it if you care about the families let's have sensible reasonable gun
[16:36.560 --> 16:40.280]  registration confiscation and make most gun owners felons and that's what it
[16:40.280 --> 16:46.600]  really does but this is something 90% of people support just give us a vote just
[16:46.600 --> 16:51.400]  do the right thing and then Obama tears up and the BBC headline is it gets
[16:51.400 --> 16:56.400]  personal for president because he he cares about the kids yeah he signs drone
[16:56.400 --> 17:00.600]  death orders where they'll kill hundreds of innocent people to quote get one

[24:35.640 --> 24:39.360]  that are really registration for confiscation criminals go out and get
[24:39.360 --> 24:42.920]  their guns regardless mentally ill people are just gonna steal them like
[24:42.920 --> 24:47.720]  Adam Lanza did if you even believe he's not a total patsy and so this argument
[24:47.720 --> 24:52.040]  of oh we just want sensible control you mean a total ban like New York or
[24:52.040 --> 24:55.840]  Chicago unless you're inside the Mafia and then you get one of those special
[24:55.840 --> 25:01.160]  permits that hardly anybody can get this is about a monopoly of power what's the
[25:01.160 --> 25:04.520]  first thing a criminal doesn't they come in a bank they say put your hands up and
[25:04.520 --> 25:09.440]  put any weapons you've got on the floor I'm not playing around I'll blow your
[25:09.440 --> 25:13.880]  head off what do they say turn your guns in or killers will blow your head off

[25:18.320 --> 25:23.560]  we made gun-free zones nobody points out the elephant in the room the government
[25:23.560 --> 25:28.000]  did this they put people on the psychotropics they created the zombie
[25:28.000 --> 25:32.400]  society they pushed it and they advertise in fact I can't believe there
[25:32.400 --> 25:36.000]  haven't been more real-school shootings after them hyping this like it's the end
[25:36.000 --> 25:40.760]  of the world they're they're using terrorism to hold us hostage and so
[25:40.760 --> 25:46.960]  Obama gets up and says hey give us a vote 90% want this implying gun control
[25:46.960 --> 25:52.960]  when they're when the poll they did of University you know minions it's like
[25:52.960 --> 25:57.040]  all the climate gate garbage was like do you think we should keep guns out of the
[25:57.040 --> 26:01.520]  hands of criminals and have a universal background check oh yes I do
[26:01.520 --> 26:05.200]  you know polling people like the Democratic state rep who says we've got
[26:05.200 --> 26:09.160]  to ban clips because after you use them you throw them away they're only good to
[26:09.160 --> 26:12.400]  use once you see you've got the globalists that know they've got a
[26:12.400 --> 26:16.160]  public you've got two different publics you've got a public that's awake and
[26:16.160 --> 26:20.760]  aware and then you've got the public that literally are as dumb as the day is
[26:20.760 --> 26:28.000]  long the most gullible soft stupid pathetic on the government dole and I
[26:28.000 --> 26:31.720]  don't just mean welfare people I mean all the government types you know them
[26:31.720 --> 26:34.800]  you've run into them these people couldn't find their butts with both
[26:34.800 --> 26:40.360]  hands and they are so pathetic the code enforcers and all of them they love to
[26:40.360 --> 26:44.120]  come and get in your face and dominate you I've been around these people where
[26:44.120 --> 26:48.240]  they're getting off on getting in your space and getting off on trying to freak

[27:01.080 --> 27:06.400]  when nato runs al-qaeda and libya and syria it's all a giant hoax and coming
[27:06.400 --> 27:11.800]  up remember all the articles last year saying oh info wars is lying drudge
[27:11.800 --> 27:16.480]  report comm is lying there's no domestic drones when we had all the local
[27:16.480 --> 27:20.800]  articles and now they're back doing it again but they just tell their followers
[27:20.800 --> 27:25.640]  there's no death panels there's no two billion bullets there's no drone sweetie
[27:25.640 --> 27:32.800]  pie the clips you throw those away after you use them and the children were
[27:32.800 --> 27:37.560]  kidnapped by bad man and a bad woman their parents and taken to run to Cuba
[27:37.560 --> 27:43.240]  got a run to Cuba got a run to another tyranny now I don't think they I guess
[27:43.240 --> 27:46.480]  they've already re-educated everybody in Cuba so there's no need to take people
[27:46.480 --> 27:50.000]  from their parents or I guess Latin Americans won't put up with that you
[27:50.000 --> 27:53.840]  know that's why communism has never flown it's been able to take over but it
[27:53.840 --> 27:57.920]  never can kill millions of people it can never totally set up the Chinese or
[27:57.920 --> 28:02.840]  Soviet style tyranny because the the Latin Americans love their kids too much
[28:02.840 --> 28:07.120]  and just won't let the state take them I mean they've got Stalinistic you know
[28:07.120 --> 28:10.840]  youth brigades in North Korea and places but and they've got some youth brigades
[28:10.840 --> 28:14.600]  in Cuba they've got some youth brigades under Chavez but it never really gets
[28:14.600 --> 28:19.440]  super nasty where they're just taking good families kids in mass I guess
[28:19.440 --> 28:24.480]  that's kind of a Latin American thing like Tony Montana no women no kids but
[28:24.480 --> 28:29.720]  see not not Obama he'll kill women and kids all day long using al-qaeda and
[28:29.720 --> 28:35.240]  then it's cute and it's funny and it's for the children and to see this lying
[28:35.240 --> 28:39.560]  opportunists that works for foreign banks who's bankrupting the country 85
[28:39.560 --> 28:44.240]  billion a month of foreign banks butchering everything shutting down our
[28:44.240 --> 28:48.560]  power plants shutting down our factories paying to ship General Motors to China
[28:48.560 --> 28:53.720]  just just shutting our country down hardcore agent of the globalist and then

[29:18.440 --> 29:22.280]  you did not turning your guns in and there's no logic of oh Chicago has the
[29:22.280 --> 29:26.720]  highest crime rate in the world and have taken the people's guns there's never

[33:09.720 --> 33:15.800]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[33:19.440 --> 33:26.760]  this is pure authoritarianism where a father in Long Island his 10 year old
[33:26.760 --> 33:32.480]  reportedly was beat up by some older kids so they joked about hey we ought to
[33:32.480 --> 33:37.080]  get water guns and squirt them so the police came and interrogated everybody
[33:37.080 --> 33:41.480]  and they said yeah we talked about having a water gun fight and so they I
[33:41.480 --> 33:45.640]  mean they admit it's over a water gun so they go back to the guy's house the
[33:45.640 --> 33:52.960]  father and they confiscate his firearms no judge no jury no order no nothing
[33:52.960 --> 33:59.800]  just like they're now announcing they're already rating federal pension funds
[34:00.800 --> 34:07.040]  and they're going to raid all the local funds and all these fools out there who
[34:07.040 --> 34:12.920]  work for the system we're going to lose everything because you went along with
[34:12.920 --> 34:17.200]  this and the general public as well the main reason this is all happening is the
[34:17.200 --> 34:21.880]  general public is on party time people want to work at their job they want to
[34:21.880 --> 34:26.560]  go home and watch television and get drunk or take drugs or play video games
[34:26.560 --> 34:33.200]  all day there's a mass narcissism upon the general population as well where
[34:33.200 --> 34:37.240]  people are just very very shallow and very very scared now there is a large
[34:37.240 --> 34:41.840]  portion of people across the political spectrum who are aware who are upset who
[34:41.840 --> 34:47.000]  are informed and if you read a Homeland Security manual none of it has to do and
[34:47.000 --> 34:51.200]  they're all public there's new ones out this week none of it is about al-qaeda
[34:51.200 --> 34:55.360]  none of it is about Muslim extremists which they set all this up on the
[34:55.360 --> 34:59.640]  auspices of and I told you I said this is going to be for constitutionalist
[34:59.640 --> 35:03.560]  this is going to be for anti globalist because this is a globalist takeover I
[35:03.560 --> 35:07.720]  know who the globalist have always targeted I know who stands in their way
[35:07.720 --> 35:14.120]  they've ratified the UN treaty at the UN now they want the Senate to ratify it
[35:14.120 --> 35:17.800]  and they're setting it up where all right there's one more school shooting
[35:17.800 --> 35:22.880]  it's your fault oh there was another school shooting see America wins enough
[35:22.880 --> 35:28.120]  enough and that's why Bloomberg and Feinstein and Michael Moore have all
[35:28.120 --> 35:31.720]  said there'll be more shootings and we're going to get your guns and they've
[35:31.720 --> 35:37.800]  also bragged the head of the Violence Policy Center hey we've got your kids
[35:38.320 --> 35:41.400]  they said this to me in the news you know in a response in the local paper in
[35:41.400 --> 35:47.440]  13 years ago they said it doesn't matter what mr. Jones does come into all our
[35:47.440 --> 35:50.960]  rallies and bullhorning us it doesn't matter what bribery he catches at the
[35:50.960 --> 35:57.480]  Capitol it doesn't matter what he does we've got your kids was the quote we've
[35:57.480 --> 36:06.600]  got your kids we've got your kids I mean it's just creepy off the chart they want
[36:06.600 --> 36:10.320]  to destroy and break the human cycle forever and and and and then make us
[36:10.320 --> 36:15.200]  literally slaves that's what slavery is is to break up
[36:15.200 --> 36:18.200]  the family that's the heart of it because they want your allegiance to
[36:18.200 --> 36:23.600]  them they want to be in full control because they crave it and they are using
[36:23.600 --> 36:31.120]  the poor dead children here is Obama's speech yesterday an
[36:31.120 --> 36:37.520]  excerpt of it is saying 90% support this legislation and they use no other poll
[36:37.520 --> 36:43.080]  shows it poll support for new gun control drops by double-digit margins at
[36:43.080 --> 36:47.800]  Sandy Hook a CBS poll
[36:49.640 --> 36:53.480]  only 47% believe they should be stricter and you know those are push polls
[36:53.480 --> 37:00.760]  more like 25% of the numbers I've got NPR ran a poll showed the same numbers
[37:00.760 --> 37:07.160]  but see they don't care they don't care
[37:07.960 --> 37:14.600]  they sit there and they say 90% want this and we're a democracy and so it's
[37:14.600 --> 37:18.000]  time to turn in the guns well we're not a democracy and I get people that say
[37:18.000 --> 37:21.320]  well it's about the people when we have foreign oligarchs foreign mega banks
[37:21.320 --> 37:25.440]  running us you can argue well let's be a democracy let's run things no no you've
[37:25.440 --> 37:31.000]  got a dumbed-down mass of people that in emotional moments they can say hey let's
[37:31.000 --> 37:35.480]  take all the guns in the 51% vote for it or the electronic voting machines say so
[37:35.480 --> 37:42.400]  then all of the other 49% have got to turn their guns in under a democracy you
[37:42.400 --> 37:51.680]  could say 51% say make all Native Americans report to be executed and then
[37:51.680 --> 37:56.560]  they'd have to report to be executed because the majority said so and even
[37:56.560 --> 38:01.600]  though we were a republic we followed a democracy idea because you already had
[38:01.600 --> 38:06.120]  indentured servants and white slaves by another name so why not have black
[38:06.120 --> 38:10.060]  slaves so I was like well they're two-thirds human and you know so they
[38:10.060 --> 38:14.620]  don't get their rights of a republic and plus it's a democracy now under the
[38:14.620 --> 38:18.800]  Republican people reading the the rules of the Republic Bill of Rights
[38:18.800 --> 38:22.900]  Constitution Declaration of Independence the idea of the Republic was then more
[38:22.900 --> 38:27.760]  and more fully expressed and uses a template of liberty worldwide that's why
[38:27.760 --> 38:32.440]  it's run down the Constitution and Bill of Rights haven't failed we have failed
[38:32.440 --> 38:40.360]  to enforce it we have failed to breathe life into it and so obama says hey we're
[38:40.360 --> 38:46.320]  a democracy the majority of people want these measures pass which he calls
[38:46.320 --> 38:51.160]  reasonable which are arresting people with over 10 round mags banning most
[38:51.160 --> 38:55.600]  semi-autos registering all the other guns and not letting you transfer guns
[38:55.600 --> 39:01.280]  to friends and family I mean they've taken the guns everywhere else they're
[39:01.280 --> 39:04.920]  in control that needs to be the message everywhere you're in control you use
[39:04.920 --> 39:08.240]  these arguments to register and then confiscate and everywhere you're in
[39:08.240 --> 39:13.200]  control in America you've totally taken the guns shut up liars and stop lying to
[39:13.200 --> 39:17.200]  me and stop pinning those dead kids on me when you made it the gun-free zone
[39:17.200 --> 39:24.520]  and you advertised it for the place for your Prozac heads to go kill people you
[39:24.520 --> 39:28.720]  shouldn't be hey be reasonable don't blame me for that crimes drop 49%
[39:28.720 --> 39:33.200]  because a gun ownership going up why are you blaming us man you're stupid they're
[39:33.200 --> 39:38.760]  not stupid they're the most mechanized organized formed foreign banking cartel
[39:38.760 --> 39:43.080]  that's completely above the law and pay zero taxes and is shutting everything
[39:43.080 --> 39:47.200]  down in the West and transferring it to Europe and then from Europe they're
[39:47.200 --> 39:50.880]  transferring it over to Asia and the people aren't even getting the benefits
[39:50.880 --> 39:57.480]  there mass suicides forced abortions suicide nets mobile execution vans hell
[39:57.480 --> 40:02.600]  on earth race to the bottom that Ross Perot warned us about there's gonna be a
[40:02.600 --> 40:07.800]  giant second sound the average American industrial workers making about $30 an
[40:07.800 --> 40:13.160]  hour Larry now we've got lower wages than Canada and we've lowered them
[40:13.160 --> 40:17.400]  Mexico the average industrial workers about a dollar an hour Larry you're
[40:17.400 --> 40:20.880]  gonna see our wages within just a year after this is implemented go down to
[40:20.880 --> 40:26.000]  about $15 Larry that's a cut of half Larry you can go watch the Ross Perot
[40:26.000 --> 40:31.880]  Al Gore debates from CNN on YouTube last time I checked they're up there both
[40:31.880 --> 40:36.560]  debates and he's getting so mad he's going listen listen they said about
[40:36.560 --> 40:40.320]  competitiveness you cannot compete with no environmental standards and no
[40:40.320 --> 40:44.800]  regulations that are put on us you will see the deindustrialization and once
[40:44.800 --> 40:50.800]  study show Larry be quiet Gore I'm trying to talk this my time the study
[40:50.800 --> 40:54.880]  show that once you lose an industrial base it does not come back and it's not
[40:54.880 --> 41:00.160]  gonna raise up China and Mexico Larry it's gonna lower them down as well
[41:00.480 --> 41:08.080]  and Al Gore would go oh this is a good deal Larry and and and the media would
[41:08.080 --> 41:14.120]  laugh at Ross Perot see because they go after the sheeple where they'll put a
[41:14.120 --> 41:17.920]  laugh track you know on the comedy shows let's laugh at Ross Perot you're
[41:17.920 --> 41:21.320]  laughing now aren't you let's laugh at people that warned you about government
[41:21.320 --> 41:25.400]  run health care out would butcher the economy shut down everything double the
[41:25.400 --> 41:29.480]  rates written by insurance companies if you make people buy something what's
[41:29.480 --> 41:32.920]  gonna happen they can raise the price stratospherically while debasing the
[41:32.920 --> 41:37.800]  quality of the product that's why North Korea can't produce an automobile I
[41:37.800 --> 41:43.920]  mean this is 101 fact I mean this is like going into the doctor and they go
[41:43.920 --> 41:50.440]  you've got lung cancer and if we remove the polyp you've got a 90% operability
[41:50.440 --> 41:55.320]  you're gonna live but that cancer within six months kills 99% of people that get
[41:55.320 --> 42:00.560]  it here's the name of it you got to cut it out right now and I'm here going
[42:00.560 --> 42:07.280]  folks we've got to cut this out right now right now right now right now this
[42:07.280 --> 42:14.560]  isn't just social has taken over France has got a 75% tax rate across the board
[42:14.560 --> 42:19.640]  on anybody working and now they've got a 75% tax rate on top of whatever you keep
[42:19.640 --> 42:29.280]  after that so you got 25% left and then 75% of of 25 what you keep 5% there's
[42:29.280 --> 42:34.600]  even less than that what's the math 75% tax I mean total and then it comes out
[42:34.600 --> 42:38.560]  that all the ruling class and the Rothschilds and all the elite aren't
[42:38.560 --> 42:42.480]  paying the taxes and are exempt just like EU bureaucrats and have Swiss bank
[42:42.480 --> 42:46.280]  accounts here's the headline French politicians rush to reveal their assets

[44:24.880 --> 44:29.500]  change that just about everybody agrees on and that's politics in Washington you
[44:29.500 --> 44:35.360]  you would think that with those numbers Congress would rush to make this happen
[44:35.360 --> 44:41.800]  that's what you would think total treason trying to overthrow a
[44:41.800 --> 44:47.140]  republic it if our democracy is working the way it's supposed we're a republic
[44:47.140 --> 44:55.800]  and 90% of the American people agree on something in the wake of a tragedy you
[44:55.800 --> 45:01.120]  think this would not be a heavy lift he spends a million dollars a night in
[45:01.120 --> 45:06.600]  hotels yet some folks back in Washington are already floating the idea that they
[45:06.600 --> 45:11.780]  may use political stunts to prevent these people are openly criminal you
[45:11.780 --> 45:14.360]  have to understand they know they're criminal think about that remember Gibbs
[45:14.360 --> 45:17.760]  said he was supposed to lie about their drones they're not just saying they'll
[45:17.760 --> 45:22.760]  vote no on ideas that almost all Americans support they're saying they'll
[45:22.760 --> 45:28.520]  do everything they can to even prevent any votes on these provisions yeah sorry
[45:28.520 --> 45:31.480]  saying your opinion doesn't matter you get enough illegal aliens here to vote
[45:31.480 --> 45:35.720]  take my gun right no right says you can't do it that is not right that is
[45:35.720 --> 45:40.520]  not right the fact that you're a Peace Prize winner is not right the fact that
[45:40.520 --> 45:44.000]  you signed the NDAA to secretly arrest us the fact that you're buying two
[45:44.000 --> 45:47.680]  billion bullets it looks like Hitler or Mao Zedong up there
[45:47.680 --> 45:52.640]  I tell you he's got enough idiots folks he'll take over look at him all smiling
[45:52.640 --> 45:56.680]  they hate gun owners this isn't about dead kids it's about their takeover

[46:03.640 --> 46:10.600]  federal family they're all gonna have their future stolen there some in the
[46:10.600 --> 46:15.120]  Washington press suggests that what happens to gun violence legislation in
[46:15.120 --> 46:23.800]  Congress this week will either be a political victory or defeat for me oh
[46:23.800 --> 46:28.720]  he's so hurt Connecticut this is not about me this is about overthrown
[46:28.720 --> 46:32.480]  America this is not about politics this is about the UN treaty this is about doing
[46:32.480 --> 46:37.120]  the right thing for all the families who are here that have been torn apart by
[46:37.120 --> 46:41.800]  this is about eugenics it's about them and all the families gone that's right
[46:41.800 --> 46:47.240]  if you don't do whatever he says you're against the families about the law
[46:47.240 --> 46:50.480]  enforcement officials putting their lives at rest let's hit pause what this
[46:50.480 --> 46:55.160]  is about it pause yeah yeah back that up ten seconds it's about the families and
[46:55.160 --> 47:00.360]  it's about the armed police and the collaborator police from all over the
[47:00.360 --> 47:05.360]  country traveling up there like ghouls to say you turn your guns in or you're
[47:05.360 --> 47:08.840]  with the criminals that's the quote of our local police chief you go along with

[47:47.180 --> 47:52.120]  offense with your world government and you can have the Southern Poverty Law
[47:52.120 --> 47:56.480]  Center and the ADL come out and say none of this exists but you know what the
[47:56.480 --> 48:00.980]  newest army training manual of how to take on Christians all Catholics are

[54:25.800 --> 54:33.880]  ladies and gentlemen we're back live and I know that I am ranting and raving
[54:33.880 --> 54:41.880]  about the unprecedented mega tyranny that our society is going under and it's
[54:41.880 --> 54:45.520]  because again it's not a boss hog takeover it's not just some corrupt guys
[54:45.520 --> 54:49.760]  that want to run things and be in charge and steal a bunch of money it's global
[54:49.760 --> 54:55.520]  Empire by a eugenicist death cult whose propaganda is everywhere I saw a Costco
[54:55.520 --> 55:01.160]  magazine last night like 80 pages thick for Costco customers and it was Billa
[55:01.160 --> 55:05.600]  Melinda Gates chairman on the front in all how much he loves people and I
[55:05.600 --> 55:09.160]  looked him up he's on the board of Costco bringing everything in from China
[55:09.160 --> 55:13.240]  and the whole magazine was like anti-human eugenics but how much they
[55:13.240 --> 55:18.860]  love the kids and how they want to give them the shots and then you look at the
[55:18.860 --> 55:21.640]  whole background of that everything they're doing is the opposite of what
[55:21.640 --> 55:24.920]  they say they're doing I just thought about the gullible public reading this
[55:24.920 --> 55:33.320]  and believing at how childlike they are how they have absolutely
[55:35.080 --> 55:40.560]  no idea what's coming down on them we've got a family coming on the former
[55:40.560 --> 55:45.080]  founding lead singer of anthrax and he and his wife are very well known that
[55:45.080 --> 55:48.240]  I've been speaking out against what autism is what the shots have done with

[55:51.680 --> 55:56.720]  whole other area of news as well big sis testing drones that can detect guns
[55:56.720 --> 55:59.960]  we're gonna get into that they're running new ads with the new with the

[56:29.920 --> 56:34.880]  some whacked-out crazy government on a power trip that's angry that a country

[56:38.840 --> 56:42.240]  and has seen the biggest increase in wealth let's see we're not going in the

[01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:48.000]  we have seen incredibly unprecedented fear-mongering using the crisis of 20
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:53.920]  dead children at Sandy Hook to openly say you turn in your guns to us or the
[01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:59.760]  next shooting is your fault when gun proliferation has made crime drop by 49%
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:06.080]  in violent crime FBI statistics public information countless articles written
[01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:10.000]  about it and then they're lecturing us these are collectives see collectivism
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:14.100]  should be called slavery because then oh your kid talks about a water gun at
[01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:18.040]  school your dad loses his guns that story is up at drugs report calm the
[01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:24.720]  left-hand side it's an info Wars calm story prison planet calm story oh you've
[01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:29.640]  got to have national compulsory service paying taxes isn't enough you've got to
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:33.760]  go work every weekend so the lazy government people can lay around that's
[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:36.760]  all being promoted by the White House and again it's because it's what the
[01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:42.880]  offshore social engineer mega banks want they want authoritarianism that's their
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:47.040]  goal so they can get 85 million dollars a month of your taxpayer money paid to
[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:51.680]  offshore banks by the Federal Reserve so that Biden could spend five hundred and
[01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:56.040]  fifty five thousand dollars a night in a hotel when he goes on a trip taxpayer
[01:09:56.040 --> 01:10:00.400]  paid for with Obama it's over a million a night so so the so Prince Charles can
[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:05.920]  have over a hundred palaces 20-something aircraft and then lecture pensioners in
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:10.320]  England on not taking a hot bath or shower for their carbon footprint it is
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:15.480]  the ultimate in hypocrisy while they have bodyguards saying we can't protect
[01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:22.000]  ourselves and meanwhile another dirtbag another dirtbag government North Korea
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:26.160]  to launch missiles tomorrow after warning foreigners to evacuate south you
[01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:28.880]  know the founding fathers said keep government smaller it will enslave you
[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:33.840]  government's a dangerous servant fearful master like fire yeah look at this they
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:37.160]  can't even build an automobile but they've got over 10,000 artillery
[01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:40.760]  pieces aimed at she all 30 miles away threatening to blow it up tomorrow
[01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:46.120]  they're loading a bombs on top missiles saying they'll nuke South Korea Japan
[01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:50.600]  they've got to actually worry over the west coast again what's the threat
[01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:55.720]  government what killed 262 million people non-military related 20th century
[01:10:55.720 --> 01:11:00.080]  government what do I worry about what are the founders worry about government
[01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:03.680]  government who wants to make vaccinations mandatory and has already
[01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:07.200]  given them to kids without parental consent in multiple states government
[01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:11.680]  government government who takes 70 plus percent of the French people's money and
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:15.720]  now wants more but is exempt from it and the whole ruling class government it
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:21.200]  turns out don't pay taxes and have Swiss bank accounts government because
[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:25.400]  government is the tool that big financial mafia interests come to to
[01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:30.920]  shut down their competition and get corporate welfare that's why Bloomberg
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:35.280]  and all these foreign bankers want your guns and want unlimited funding I want
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:39.680]  to say we're a democracy because they can say hey we'll give you a one-time
[01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:43.400]  thousand-dollar check if you get behind voting to get rid of the middle class
[01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:46.520]  and take all their money that's only a couple trillion dollars and give it to
[01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:50.920]  the government okay all okay give me a thousand dollars sell your birthright
[01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:54.320]  for a thought and then you give the two trillion to foreign banks which is
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:56.880]  nothing they could have made the two trillion up out of thin air with
[01:11:56.880 --> 01:12:07.320]  fractional reserve banking and an XM export import bank SDRs but they want to
[01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:11.640]  get rid of the middle class once and for all because the middle class is informed
[01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:14.240]  enough to have their own business they're informed enough to know how the
[01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:17.920]  world works they're informed enough to plant the crops and bring the crops in
[01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:23.960]  they're real people they're not slovenly little spoiled brat punk kids sent to
[01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:28.680]  college to get a globalist corporate job or some government job to then lecture
[01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:34.680]  to us how dumb we are all day let me tell you I talked to the average so
[01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:41.760]  called liberal out there and they think gun magazines they think gun magazines
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:46.920]  are disposable they think that they don't know that gun crimes way down
[01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:50.240]  because of gun ownership going up they don't know any of that they don't know
[01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:53.940]  what they're not liberals they're authoritarian dupes and the problem is
[01:12:53.940 --> 01:12:57.720]  the Republicans work for the very same people at the top weather because this
[01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:01.980]  is a global government this is a global system of control I want to play this
[01:13:01.980 --> 01:13:06.680]  newscast because they've been denying that this exists even though it's in
[01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:12.000]  Wired magazine AP Reuters FAA funding a year ago to launch 30,000 drones they're
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:15.420]  arresting people for environmental infractions building a shed on their
[01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:19.920]  property they can't with drones for years manned aircraft as well and
[01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:23.880]  remember they say Alex Jones is a liar there are no drones there are no weapons
[01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:26.760]  drones there are no police drones because they don't want you to get
[01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:30.960]  politically involved to say no they just there are no bullets there are no
[01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:34.100]  checkpoints the TSA isn't sticking their hands down your pants even though they
[01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:37.600]  are why do they lie even when they get caught the White House press secretary
[01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:42.360]  told us why because then they could just put you in an Alice in Wonderland level
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:45.800]  or even though you know you're they're lying you can't ever get anywhere
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:49.280]  because they just keep denying it because they're in control because they
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:53.860]  stole everything they're not gonna have a debate with you because they can't
[01:13:53.860 --> 01:14:02.380]  Oh US Saturday says disavow drone program give no he was told to lie about
[01:14:02.380 --> 01:14:06.360]  something he that it was on record to exist that's how dumb they think you are
[01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:11.920]  so here is a Oklahoma newscast short newscast where Homeland Security and the
[01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:15.340]  governor's office are running drones that target people that have guns and
[01:14:15.340 --> 01:14:19.920]  then we have the Homeland Security training video where it shows people
[01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:24.920]  selling someone a gun American you know redneck guys with camo hats out in the
[01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:31.360]  field this is what Homeland Security's for an authoritarian takeover they've
[01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:35.520]  got it in place they think they can take over they'll probably stage some false
[01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:39.240]  flags to blame it on us we're in a red-level crisis here's that newscast
[01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:43.920]  how about this elite to government report reveals testing in Oklahoma of
[01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:48.400]  drones drones that have sensors that can find people and even tell if they're
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:52.640]  carrying a weapon this is happening at a remote site now dear near the Lawton
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:56.120]  area at Fort Sill News 9's Dana Hurt Nikki has the details here new at six
[01:14:56.120 --> 01:15:00.720]  according to the report the testing is taking place here at the Oklahoma
[01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:05.160]  Training Center for unmanned systems operated by Oklahoma State University
[01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:10.240]  the group doing the work is a quote trusted agent of the federal government
[01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:15.480]  located directly across from a cattle pasture in an unassuming house in the
[01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:19.880]  middle of Oklahoma researchers are conducting some of the most cutting-edge
[01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:25.680]  and controversial testing of drone technology it's advanced technology for
[01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:31.680]  sure it's technology that that we don't want any of our enemies to to have Tony
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:36.080]  Strickland stop right there for the center but they always that's like
[01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:39.320]  warfare we don't want our enemies to have our enemies took America over
[01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:44.120]  they've got all our money building robot armies against us

[01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:27.600]  real warning Obama wants talk about 20 dead kids and try to collectively say
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:31.920]  it's our guilt just a government victimization zone advertises a place
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:35.920]  for mass shooters now we have no guilt but we do have guilt in letting them
[01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:39.400]  push deadly vaccines that they know we're causing autoimmune responses on
[01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:43.200]  the brain and massive brain damage and also attacking the intestines with
[01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:47.160]  autoimmune disorders and I've had top scientists brain surgeons you name it on
[01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:50.680]  and we're going to break here in a few minutes but Dan thank you for coming on
[01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:57.800]  with candy today via video Skype just in a nutshell your boys were already you
[01:17:57.800 --> 01:18:01.440]  know TV stars they were already all over the place they were already amazing and
[01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:06.840]  then they got hit with a with the bio weapon Dan good to have you with us yeah
[01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:11.200]  our children Brendan and Jayden who are now five they're identical mirror image
[01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:16.440]  twins which is the closest to conjoined so they are from the same egg and you
[01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:20.200]  know no fertility drugs or anything like that real old schools you know old
[01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:24.400]  school twins and they were hitting every milestone they were walking talking
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:29.840]  normal kids and you know we're the parents who don't have to say well we
[01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:34.600]  have video proof that our children are weren't born with autism because they
[01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:38.640]  were acting in the movie away we go which was directed by an Academy Award
[01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:43.720]  winning a director Sam Mendez and acting with Maggie Gyllenhaal in that movie
[01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:47.560]  they were in commercials with Brooke Shields for Volkswagen so we have video
[01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:51.800]  proof from outsiders that you know they made eye contact they took direction at
[01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:56.800]  very young ages they could be touched by people other than us or just be touched
[01:18:56.800 --> 01:19:01.560]  in general and so on and so forth so right down the line you know as normal
[01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:06.120]  as normal can be for identical twins and and ahead of what normal identical twins
[01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:13.480]  would be and then of course you know we had the normal 12 months vaccines which

[01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:22.640]  up dan and candy spitz are our guest right now he's one of the founding
[01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:26.280]  members of anthrax and a bunch of other big rock bands I mean I've been to
[01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:31.680]  concerts and actually watched him up on stage when I was a teenager and one of
[01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:37.080]  our crew members wife went into labor today having twins in fact I didn't ask
[01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:39.600]  if they're identical or fraternal I don't think they know or they didn't
[01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:43.880]  tell me but I mean imagine anybody that has children the magic of your children
[01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:48.080]  they're up they're walking they're talking they get shots the second round
[01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:52.280]  the third round and they're gone and the insert says it can cause neurological
[01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:56.960]  disorders but then they have a hoax oh no there's no connection everything's
[01:24:56.960 --> 01:25:03.080]  fine but Dan and candy candy they're with you I don't know how you can I mean
[01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:07.800]  I guess you fight back by speaking out but I mean what was it like for you when
[01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:12.440]  this happened well let me let me add candy who is the national spokesperson
[01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:17.600]  for autism speaks kind of kind of take it from here absolutely go ahead yeah I
[01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:21.600]  said we we have two different viewpoints on the vaccines and just like you're
[01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:26.840]  saying when it first happened we really attributed autism to the vaccines like
[01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:31.280]  Dan said you know Jayden was jumping off the couch at eight months old he had the
[01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:35.200]  vaccines a 12 month is the cocktail is the MMR you're getting 37 shots and
[01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:41.640]  like a total of like four we watched him you know resort to nothing he was
[01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:45.280]  laying on a couch for five days straight he didn't eat he didn't sleep he
[01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:48.560]  wouldn't go into his crib he wouldn't do anything but at the end of those five
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:53.240]  days they did seem to come back to normal so we were playing both sides of
[01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:56.200]  the field here at one point we're going okay we just gave them the autism shot
[01:25:56.200 --> 01:26:00.680]  the word was out there you know there was no denying it that was 2009 you know
[01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:05.320]  there's no denying it was the autism shot but after five days they seemed to
[01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:09.400]  come back to normal and we kind of got our kids back so for a while there we
[01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:12.600]  didn't know anything else was wrong we went through a period from age say 12
[01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:18.360]  months to 17 months where our kids were right back to working playing and doing
[01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:21.600]  all the things that they were doing but they really weren't making the progress
[01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:26.160]  that they once did where we had everything early and then over a two
[01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:31.320]  week window we lost every skill that they have they stopped walking talking
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:38.200]  playing eating eye contact they would shriek if we touch them and they would
[01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:41.160]  by the end of the two weeks they would just rock they would press this ball
[01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:45.240]  popper toy like an air motor and they would rock back and forth you could
[01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:48.720]  wave your hands in front of them you know they were gone there was nothing
[01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:53.280]  we can do and that's when you know for both of us you know we realized
[01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:57.640]  something was wrong but we didn't know it was autism at the time you know this
[01:26:57.640 --> 01:27:01.920]  is just four years ago four and a half years ago and the word still wasn't out
[01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:05.320]  there there was a couple you know people you know in the press who were you know
[01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:09.680]  speaking of vaccines and autism but the word wasn't there so we're going what
[01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:15.320]  happened to our perfect kids and we reacted differently you know we took
[01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:18.080]  them right into the pediatrician you know right at 18 months and said
[01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:21.720]  something's wrong but your doctors are telling you you know candy you know I
[01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:25.640]  have had them since birth I've given them every shot you know there you know
[01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:31.200]  you know factually there's nothing that can be caused by the vaccines and true
[01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:37.880]  you know the facts say no but as a mom and your gut you're saying you know
[01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:41.760]  something's wrong here you know I'm only 38 years old and I did not get the same
[01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:45.200]  cocktail 38 years ago that my children are getting now and every state's
[01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:49.360]  vaccines are different so in New York where we were at the time they were
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:52.600]  getting a lot more aggressive shots than say here in Florida where we live now
[01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:57.560]  and the more you start looking at this our friends who are all doctors weren't
[01:27:57.560 --> 01:28:00.360]  giving their kids the shots or they would but they would spread them out
[01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:04.760]  the 12-month shot they would get one at 15 I was about to say most the doctors
[01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:08.720]  and nurses I know their kids have had no shots now but they're like oh you need
[01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:12.280]  to take it so now they're trying to make medical staff take it as well this is a
[01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:16.440]  real tyranny yeah you know we do all the studies now because it is in the public
[01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:19.920]  eye and I'm trying to be you know the first one speaking out in true metal
[01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:23.840]  form and the truth you know through music of all the studies that we are
[01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:27.880]  doing you know so much really do a study and see how many doctors how many of
[01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:31.080]  their cousins and their their cousins children are really getting the shots on
[01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:36.120]  time but a big factor with autism and you know something we both try to draw
[01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:39.560]  attention to and I don't know how much you're familiar with this is a lot of
[01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:43.920]  what our children have gone through has been environmental which goes along the
[01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:47.400]  same lines of the vaccines but what's in our plastics you know our foods our
[01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:53.180]  pesticides you know chemtrails in the air that's where we saw the link for you
[01:28:53.180 --> 01:28:56.340]  know us as a family we really think the vaccines might have been a trigger well
[01:28:56.340 --> 01:29:00.000]  that's exactly where I was going it's a binary weapons system from the documents
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:04.960]  we've got and while you guys are really done your research that's yet with our
[01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:10.760]  with our kids with plastics BPA was not recalled until 2009 so two or six months
[01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:15.400]  after the boys were diagnosed their you know their bottles their pacifiers
[01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:19.080]  everything that they always used and as children with autism do they only use
[01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:23.360]  one certain set of tools and they were all disappearing from the shelves and I
[01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:27.000]  couldn't find why and it was one of those middle of the night Danny and
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.880]  the stain we're out in California writing the album you know I'm up all
[01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:34.360]  night searching like where can I buy their bottles and I see something about
[01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:40.000]  BPA so look hold on I gotta hear this because again I'm familiar with your
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.920]  group there's so much going on I've separately learned this you've
[01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:46.800]  separately learned it it's an example of how the truth's hiding in plain view the
[01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:51.960]  vaccines are the binary weapon trigger we'll be right back we're on the March
[01:29:51.960 --> 01:30:02.800]  the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network I had tried
[01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:06.560]  everything I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating I was lifting weights
[01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:11.360]  and jogging but nothing was working my body was literally starving for minerals
[01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:15.280]  and trace elements as well as key vitamins and as soon as I had that I
[01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:20.680]  immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied now

[01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:37.160]  radio show and I'm up here going hey let's talk about the weather let's talk
[01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:41.760]  about you know how the local football team is doing it totally freaks me out
[01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:47.160]  that I've had countless medical doctors on like dr. Russell Blaylock brain
[01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:51.320]  surgeon who's in all the mainline medical literature discovering
[01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:58.160]  excitotoxins they know aspartame in most candy and now going into food unlabeled
[01:33:58.160 --> 01:34:03.640]  is what alcohol and brain damages you and is highly addictive they know that
[01:34:03.640 --> 01:34:07.640]  for 50 plus years they've been putting silicone in the frying agents at most
[01:34:07.640 --> 01:34:12.040]  of fast food places I mean just total kidney failure and cancer rates are up
[01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:17.640]  over 3,000 percent pediatric over 10,000 percent autism was one in 30,000 it's
[01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:23.840]  one in 50 something and I've done the research it's all eugenicists that came
[01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:30.200]  up with the bisphenol a in fact if you want to go after right-wing grips that
[01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:33.760]  are controlled the Koch brothers are heavily involved in distillates and
[01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:37.440]  bisphenol a and they had all these other plastics they could have used they use
[01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:42.180]  the estrogen mimicker and then you look at the pesticide and you look at the
[01:34:42.180 --> 01:34:45.720]  sodium fluoride sprayed on the crops as a pesticide and the fluoride in the
[01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:50.880]  water and the Harvard studies on lowered IQ and bone problems increased cancer
[01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:54.640]  I'll put some of this on screen for TV viewers but radio listeners can just
[01:34:54.640 --> 01:34:58.480]  search everything I'm saying and it's desperate I mean that's why I yell and
[01:34:58.480 --> 01:35:05.160]  scream is because I look at my children innocent good never had a shot hardly
[01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:10.200]  eat any GMO and I go watch other kids at sporting events and stuff and I sit in
[01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:15.720]  restaurants kids look like zombies man and and the physical IQ is dropped about
[01:35:15.720 --> 01:35:21.560]  15 points the last 30 years you can look that up the kids are unhealthy the
[01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:27.480]  parents are unhealthy the fertility is down the sperm counts down 87% they they
[01:35:27.480 --> 01:35:32.240]  are attacking us and I'm gonna shut up and go to our guest here Dan Spitz and
[01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:36.520]  his wife who does this full-time fighting and you can go to autism speaks
[01:35:36.520 --> 01:35:40.720]  dot org and and just see all the amazing work they're doing and they're not
[01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:45.960]  mincing words they're not playing games but this is all a soft kill test to just
[01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:50.320]  see you know can we give a hundred million Americans conservatively with
[01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:58.160]  the polio vaccine the SV 40 cancer virus that made rare cancers common I mean you
[01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:00.640]  know that we're not on the 20 dead kids at Sandy Hook that they're trying to
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:03.920]  hype up to take our guns we're talking about millions of people dying of cancer
[01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:08.080]  a hundred plus million exposed and they're still giving the same vaccine
[01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:12.080]  today with the live virus in it the UN's been caught sterilizing women with
[01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:16.400]  tetanus shots with a female hormone added this isn't my opinion and it
[01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:19.440]  doesn't matter though Costco magazine says Bill and Linda Gates love the
[01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:25.800]  children so going back to Dan Spitz and also his wife Candy Spitz you guys have
[01:36:25.800 --> 01:36:29.400]  got the floor tell us what you've learned the cocktail what happened with
[01:36:29.400 --> 01:36:33.560]  your boys what you've learned since then and and and now they're wanting to just
[01:36:33.560 --> 01:36:37.320]  push dozens and dozens of new vaccines a year on us you got to take shots to go
[01:36:37.320 --> 01:36:41.800]  to college the flu shot doesn't even protect you doubles your chances of
[01:36:41.800 --> 01:36:47.480]  getting it this is all facts it's such a hoax how bad does it have to get well
[01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:51.000]  you know I'll give it to candy again because what you know when she found out
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:55.480]  about the BPA and I remember this is just a years ago when no one knew you
[01:36:55.480 --> 01:36:59.320]  know she she's like freaking out on me telling me you know our children had
[01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:02.840]  really regressed so she'll tell you what happened from there well like you were
[01:37:02.840 --> 01:37:06.280]  saying I said the scary part is and you can go out of your way as a parent as
[01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:09.520]  the mom you're carrying this child for nine months to make sure that you did
[01:37:09.520 --> 01:37:13.560]  everything right you know I knew all I did was eat sleep and workout you know I
[01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:18.520]  all organic bottled water and spinach all day but then to learn that I really
[01:37:18.520 --> 01:37:22.800]  had no control because in those plastic bottles of water was BPA you know there
[01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:28.440]  was a pesticide on my spinach that I ate five meals a day and it was it was right
[01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:32.960]  in my face when you know I said in 2009 my kids were six months diagnosed with
[01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:38.120]  autism and BPA is now a voluntary recall which means they didn't have to announce
[01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:42.400]  it to anybody baby bottles just came up the shelves you know bowls pacifiers
[01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:46.920]  everything just came up the shelves I panicked you know I went to the pantry
[01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:51.360]  and everything had code 7 on it which was BPA free yeah I freaked I called
[01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:54.760]  Danny and mistake I'm like yeah if I heat this bottle up in the microwave
[01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:58.320]  we've been doing this whole time you know this is going to slow down this is
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:01.840]  why they're not talking and so on and so forth and that's what happened I you
[01:38:01.840 --> 01:38:04.600]  know I said I threw out everything the pantry I called one of the boys
[01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:08.760]  therapists whose husband was a physician and said oh my god not only did I give
[01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:12.460]  them the vaccines that caused autism now I've been poisoning my children you know
[01:38:12.460 --> 01:38:17.160]  for two years with plastic and threw out everything in the house went a little
[01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:22.200]  berserk as a mom and within two days of removing all plastics from the house
[01:38:22.200 --> 01:38:26.640]  they made sounds for the first time just hadn't talked since they regressed at
[01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:29.920]  18 months just little sounds you know animal sounds and things like that it
[01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:34.560]  was our first time hearing anything vocal out of them called the same
[01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:38.280]  therapist same doctor back and said am I going crazy you know it's been 48 hours
[01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:41.400]  is that even possible and they said of course it's possible once that
[01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:45.320]  particular toxin was removed from their body however long it took for your kids
[01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:48.780]  you know it opened up that barrier again in the brain but you don't know what
[01:38:48.780 --> 01:38:52.960]  damage has been caused by two years worth of plastic and a plastic was
[01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:56.320]  causing it you don't know what household cleaners were doing and pesticides in
[01:38:56.320 --> 01:39:01.080]  the grass cumulative effect as you said earlier of the you know all of these
[01:39:01.080 --> 01:39:05.440]  factors above that past generations didn't have but it's all out of our
[01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:09.400]  hands there's nothing you can do at that point and for us that's when you know I
[01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:12.720]  became this big advocate for autism speaks and my role really changed
[01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:16.800]  because there's nothing I can do to stop the fact that my children have autism
[01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:21.040]  and there is no cure I don't care what anyone wants to hype out there there is
[01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:25.080]  no cure for autism you can correct behaviors you know you can work around
[01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:29.280]  this and your children really can flourish our kids are doing amazing but
[01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:34.380]  you can't cure it and you know I leave it up to my incredible team and autism
[01:39:34.380 --> 01:39:37.960]  speaks that's what they're for they're there to find out the how's the why this
[01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:41.480]  happens you know what we can do to prevent it for future generations but
[01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:46.720]  for right now the whole face of society has changed in 20 years everybody you
[01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:51.700]  know will have something you know ADD ADHD OCD autism there's gonna be some
[01:39:51.700 --> 01:39:56.040]  kind of neurological effects and something is causing it this was not
[01:39:56.040 --> 01:40:00.000]  naturally happening you know a new government report now shows one in 50
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:04.000]  it's not the true number for autism yet it's just a government study but one in
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:08.200]  50 school children now has autism a million school children just in the
[01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:13.400]  United States and that's scary because of what are we gonna be you know in 20
[01:40:13.400 --> 01:40:16.440]  years this is your government leader what are we gonna do with everybody is
[01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:20.480]  is the reason that I've returned the music full-time and helping to spread
[01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:24.520]  the truth and the awareness the only way I know how and that's what I do and
[01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:27.700]  that's you know heavy metal and that's telling the truth and and that's what
[01:40:27.700 --> 01:40:32.640]  candy does we're just here to let people into our lives and really hear the truth
[01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:38.300]  of what's going on I want to talk about John P Holdren's book you know he's the
[01:40:38.300 --> 01:40:41.680]  White House science are in this book they talk about putting chemicals in the
[01:40:41.680 --> 01:40:46.240]  food and water to lower the IQ to make us more easily managed they talk about
[01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:49.680]  sterilizing us through stuff in the water and then of course we have State
[01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:53.200]  Department random 200 where they actually did all of this I just want
[01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:57.040]  you to know this was all done on purpose and I want to warn everybody out there
[01:40:57.040 --> 01:41:01.600]  the people running things are very very wicked I've actually heard that I
[01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:05.840]  haven't read read the book I have heard that um the problem that where it
[01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:10.040]  conflicts with autism is most children or adult anyone on the spectrum itself
[01:41:10.040 --> 01:41:14.480]  actually has very high IQs we have higher than normal IQs and so they can
[01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:19.280]  do things that regular children cannot do so unfortunately that very just does
[01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:23.560]  not play into autism it does into a lot of the other neurological disorders well
[01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:26.960]  sure I mean it's meant to dumb the general public down and then some people
[01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:31.800]  it can create almost an idiot savant effect and and and of course you know
[01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:35.400]  the some time when the brain is attacked early on it can reach regenerate or
[01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:39.240]  start new pathways and might actually create you know supermen in some case
[01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:43.120]  because that's how life works you start poisoning bugs and within a couple
[01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:48.000]  generations they become immune and become even more powerful extreme highs
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:52.600]  and extreme lows in our own children they can run multiple iPads at the same
[01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:57.280]  time doing things what two years old they said they wouldn't talk on we had a
[01:41:57.280 --> 01:42:01.720]  speech pathologist who were with us in our home who had been doing it for 21
[01:42:01.720 --> 01:42:06.040]  years dealing with children on the spectrum and she's almost basically gave
[01:42:06.040 --> 01:42:09.480]  up and we turned around one of our children reached in her handbag grab
[01:42:09.480 --> 01:42:13.560]  their iPhone cracked her code and started moving all our apps around but
[01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:16.680]  they were reading at two years old but they couldn't speak you know now they're
[01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:20.200]  almost six years old and they can't feed themselves you know they're still in
[01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:25.020]  diapers there's so you get highs and lows they are brilliant they can play
[01:42:25.020 --> 01:42:29.320]  piano by ear never had a lesson you know they're standing with guitar they picked
[01:42:29.320 --> 01:42:34.440]  up most instruments and they can sing any song through repetition but yet they
[01:42:34.440 --> 01:42:38.120]  can't have a conversation with you and they speak on the level of say a 16 to
[01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:43.200]  18 month old so there's extreme highs and extreme lows and every child with
[01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:47.280]  autism is different even though our kids are mirror image twins are actually one
[01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:53.120]  child split in two their autism is the farthest from you know from this from
[01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:57.080]  the same yeah they're different that's that's what was baffling a lot of early
[01:42:57.080 --> 01:43:00.120]  on that the therapist that would visit our house they were almost like a study
[01:43:00.120 --> 01:43:03.720]  case because they realized wait a minute it is the same egg how come it didn't
[01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:09.240]  affect them exactly the same well it's very very frustrating what we know is
[01:43:09.240 --> 01:43:16.200]  this and that's a great point that candy was starting to allude to is that when
[01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:19.680]  the public found out about bisphenol a and oh there were all these studies
[01:43:19.680 --> 01:43:23.680]  proving that it was an estrogen mimic herb there was no debate of course they
[01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:26.720]  don't know on purpose worldwide I even have stuff where they bragged about it
[01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:31.360]  the 70s how they would do it and and causes all these neurological problems
[01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:36.600]  they quietly withdrew it but it's kind of like okay aspartame causes brain
[01:43:36.600 --> 01:43:40.080]  damage their answer is to get regulations passed where they don't call
[01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:43.560]  it aspartame and they put it in everything I mean this is we the
[01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:46.480]  globalists say the world is overpopulated and whether it is or
[01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:49.760]  isn't people should know because a lot of yuppies go well there are too many
[01:43:49.760 --> 01:43:53.760]  people all right so the UN got caught sterilizing people the point is they're
[01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:59.480]  doing it to us and and it's also very inhumane if you're gonna sterilize
[01:43:59.480 --> 01:44:04.760]  people or try to brain damage them to to like just soft kill the the public it'd
[01:44:04.760 --> 01:44:09.600]  be nicer to just you know nerve gas everybody I mean the way they do it is
[01:44:09.600 --> 01:44:13.240]  just so cold-blooded and then they want to sit here and play games like they're
[01:44:13.240 --> 01:44:17.800]  not doing it like Bill and Melinda Gates weren't on with his dad the board of
[01:44:17.800 --> 01:44:20.960]  Planned Parenthood that they're not eugenicist I have it all on record that
[01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:24.720]  IBM wasn't started by eugenicist who made the machines for the Nazis you know
[01:44:24.720 --> 01:44:27.980]  the Hollerith machines I mean I know the whole history I know who they are I know
[01:44:27.980 --> 01:44:32.720]  their plan I know they're jacking the daylights out of us Monsanto will not
[01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:38.600]  have any of the food at their facilities that's GMO their scientists demand non
[01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:43.280]  GMO that's that's ten-year-old news the communist Chinese shame deal have secret
[01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:47.040]  greenhouses for their food the elite is all obsessed with this while they're
[01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:51.320]  giving it all to us and it's like a psycho thriller movie but we're living
[01:44:51.320 --> 01:44:56.560]  in it and and literally I've got over a hundred books at this office where they
[01:44:56.560 --> 01:44:59.920]  all just admit what they're doing to us and that's what's so frustrating I mean
[01:44:59.920 --> 01:45:04.320]  but but bottom line they took the bisphenol a off the shelves in most
[01:45:04.320 --> 01:45:08.240]  places because but they're not taking the shots off they're doubling and
[01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:11.720]  tripling down have you seen the newscast where they say mercury is good for your
[01:45:11.720 --> 01:45:21.240]  brain what's the rush at 12 months to you know you have to do this you have to
[01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:24.520]  do that and that's what they're being told we were all being told and it's
[01:45:24.520 --> 01:45:27.160]  almost like we're brain like no you can't you can't do this you can't get
[01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:30.400]  the kindergarten if you don't get that you know what spread it out a little bit
[01:45:30.400 --> 01:45:33.400]  more and you know that's what the doctors are doing to their children
[01:45:33.400 --> 01:45:38.440]  they're waiting if they see the their child is a boy or it's a nervous system
[01:45:38.440 --> 01:45:41.640]  is developing a little slower spread it out a little bit more if they're gonna
[01:45:41.640 --> 01:45:46.120]  if they're gonna push 38 vaccines into you spread it out but they also don't
[01:45:46.120 --> 01:45:49.280]  tell you that you don't necessarily say you know our kids have the MMR everybody
[01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:52.880]  does it in 12 months you get this big cocktail at 12 months old and you have
[01:45:52.880 --> 01:45:55.440]  to have it again at five for the school district and you have to have it again
[01:45:55.440 --> 01:46:00.320]  and say like 12 years old or something you really don't physically need to have
[01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:03.760]  that shot again you can be tested which our kids were this year thank goodness
[01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:06.860]  they have an incredible pediatrician you couldn't believe it where you know the
[01:46:06.860 --> 01:46:09.520]  schools are telling us even though our kids do go to a special charter school
[01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:12.760]  just for autism and we do get away with a lot of things that we don't necessarily
[01:46:12.760 --> 01:46:16.280]  would get away with in the public school system but they were still telling us
[01:46:16.280 --> 01:46:19.200]  no time for your five-year-old shots and we went in the pediatrician said
[01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:22.320]  absolutely not she goes let me test their blood because if they're still
[01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:25.680]  immune to all of these things why on earth do we need to give him the shots
[01:46:25.680 --> 01:46:29.320]  again there's no reason just because the schedule says I have to pump you full of
[01:46:29.320 --> 01:46:35.440]  more medicine well we went first time that the shot wasn't there and yeah it
[01:46:35.440 --> 01:46:38.440]  was there was a lot of things leading up to it but clearly we were not supposed
[01:46:38.440 --> 01:46:43.800]  to get shaken to get this shot if I mean as you could well imagine and and she
[01:46:43.800 --> 01:46:46.600]  did said hey wait a minute you know we can test you know Brendan and Jayden
[01:46:46.600 --> 01:46:50.520]  then they might have a natural immunity to these vaccines and guess what they
[01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:55.080]  did well you know what else is amazing they lie and say it's the law to take
[01:46:55.080 --> 01:47:00.340]  shots when it's not it's a state health department policy and then they tell you
[01:47:00.340 --> 01:47:03.360]  to get a waiver and act like it's the law but they won't tell most parents
[01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:07.680]  that there's even a waiver this is so cold-blooded and I had a state attorney
[01:47:07.680 --> 01:47:12.520]  on for Maryland when they were making kids take shots a few years ago and he
[01:47:12.520 --> 01:47:16.800]  admitted oh I don't give my kids shots but but but he told them it was the law
[01:47:16.800 --> 01:47:22.200]  to take the shots I mean it's just like man yeah that's why I said you know do
[01:47:22.200 --> 01:47:25.200]  the study on the doctors and their cousins and see when they're getting
[01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:29.000]  their kids shots but that's what this organizations though now like autism
[01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.240]  speaks that are out there giving you they're not going to give you one
[01:47:31.240 --> 01:47:34.720]  viewpoint and say yes it's vaccines yes it's genetic yes it's this they're kind
[01:47:34.720 --> 01:47:38.520]  of showing you everything that's out there and not guiding you this way you
[01:47:38.520 --> 01:47:43.140]  as a parent are you as an educator you as society have the chance to look into
[01:47:43.140 --> 01:47:46.380]  this for yourselves you know do I want my child to have shots I don't want my
[01:47:46.380 --> 01:47:50.160]  child to have shots so I want to do a special diet does it have any effect you
[01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:54.420]  as the parent really need to be looking into this for your own child I'm not
[01:47:54.420 --> 01:47:57.760]  going to trust any government official you know any teacher there I'm not going
[01:47:57.760 --> 01:48:02.320]  to trust anybody with making the best decisions for my children so the
[01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:05.160]  information needs to be out there and it really wasn't out there four and a half
[01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:09.480]  years ago when we started this but it's all out there now and that's what we try
[01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:13.020]  to guide everybody to autism speaks website because you can have just a
[01:48:13.020 --> 01:48:15.760]  question you know it's not saying you have to go to donate to this
[01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:18.840]  organization I don't even care if you believe in this organization even though
[01:48:18.840 --> 01:48:23.720]  I'm the spokesperson I get both sides of the coin well I have parents call me all
[01:48:23.720 --> 01:48:26.480]  the time I mean if I open the phones up we'd have countless parents with their
[01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:30.280]  other children were fine got the shot had a convulsion parents will call in
[01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:33.640]  have had their kids taken after the shot makes them have a convulsion because you
[01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:37.080]  must have beaten your child there's blood on the brain when the insert you
[01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:40.640]  know admitted that could cause that they know full well what they're doing it's
[01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:46.840]  it's it's a cult it's human sacrifice of our children but here's a video MSNBC
[01:48:46.840 --> 01:48:51.120]  host your kids belong to the collective this is an ad they're running where
[01:48:51.120 --> 01:48:55.960]  Melissa Harris Perry says that now we've got to get past the private idea that
[01:48:55.960 --> 01:48:58.960]  your kids belong to you but they don't mean help kids in the community they
[01:48:58.960 --> 01:49:02.360]  mean the community's coming like California where they give shots to kids
[01:49:02.360 --> 01:49:07.680]  without parental consent these people are very creepy here's the clip we have
[01:49:07.680 --> 01:49:11.520]  never invested as much in public education as we should have because
[01:49:11.520 --> 01:49:15.520]  we've always had kind of a private notion of children your kid is yours and
[01:49:15.520 --> 01:49:19.560]  totally your responsibility we haven't had a very collective notion of these
[01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:22.840]  are our children so part of it is we have to break through our kind of
[01:49:22.840 --> 01:49:26.920]  private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families
[01:49:26.920 --> 01:49:30.240]  and recognize that kids belong to whole communities once it's everybody's
[01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:33.600]  responsibility and not just the households then we start making better
[01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:38.800]  investments now that we're collective eyes we've all got to have our decisions
[01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:43.280]  taken over by the top brain bugs because they know best guys what's your what's
[01:49:43.280 --> 01:49:48.360]  your take on that statement you just heard you know what I'm trying to do is
[01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:52.760]  is candy does what she does and I do what I do with my new band red lamb
[01:49:52.760 --> 01:49:56.720]  bushes the collaborative with me and Davis just to bring that awareness that
[01:49:56.720 --> 01:50:01.960]  we are in a new generation we need to move forward if if you do see signs I
[01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:05.200]  know after your child has the shots or so on and so forth that something's
[01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:09.280]  wrong or if you have twins that we can't listen to our past generations our
[01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:12.640]  grandmothers or our great-grandmothers we're still around going you know wait a
[01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:16.120]  little while you know he might be all right you know you didn't talk till you
[01:50:16.120 --> 01:50:19.920]  were three and so on and so forth we have to think for ourselves and act fast
[01:50:19.920 --> 01:50:25.160]  to get to the problem swiftly and when the mind is pliable at a very young age
[01:50:25.160 --> 01:50:29.440]  as we did and we were blessed with when candy stumbled on the autism speech site
[01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:33.640]  and we were able to get our information so that's what I'm doing in music and
[01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:37.080]  it's about time somebody did it in music because it's pretty much everywhere else
[01:50:37.080 --> 01:50:39.960]  in all the other arts fields yeah well I just want people to know this is
[01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:44.320]  personal they're doing this on purpose so just remember that and the
[01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:48.360]  collaborator doctors nurses most of them don't take the shots they all know
[01:50:48.360 --> 01:50:52.920]  what's going on it's all it's a joke to them and I know that's hard to believe
[01:50:52.920 --> 01:50:57.400]  but look at Nazi Germany Soviet Russia this is what collectivists do they are a
[01:50:57.400 --> 01:51:02.720]  bunch of scum and by the way I have the clip of them saying mercury's good you
[01:51:02.720 --> 01:51:06.840]  prepare by purchasing gold food and firearms but if you don't have a home

[01:52:29.400 --> 01:52:33.600]  start going out across America but here's some good news there's an
[01:52:33.600 --> 01:52:38.240]  underground video at exposed one two three dot-com that thousands of smart

[01:54:14.720 --> 01:54:20.840]  out there with vaccines damaging people but they never get media attention but
[01:54:20.840 --> 01:54:24.560]  then they'll have Journal of Pediatrics government-funded studies saying hey
[01:54:24.560 --> 01:54:28.120]  first they said there's not mercury even though there was and they said okay we
[01:54:28.120 --> 01:54:32.480]  took it out when they didn't then they changed their story this is eight years
[01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:37.480]  ago this was on a CBS News all over the country this was the Austin version of
[01:54:37.480 --> 01:54:41.760]  it but CBS Nightly News came out and just last year they said this again
[01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:48.120]  actually mercury containing vaccines increase your child's performance and
[01:54:48.120 --> 01:54:51.480]  behavior I see that's Orwellian they mean a vegetable to do whatever they're
[01:54:51.480 --> 01:54:56.680]  told you know just like they won't hire cops with over 100 IQ now I mean this is
[01:54:56.680 --> 01:55:02.240]  a hive system where the big brain bugs are up on top we're down here on the
[01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:06.860]  bottom and you know if they can't I mean you know they didn't let slaves learn

[01:55:24.880 --> 01:55:30.000]  mercury containing vaccines may have on kids a life-saving device wins over the

[01:55:38.440 --> 01:55:41.840]  medical watcher Porter see the matter
[01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:47.480]  mercury containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies
[01:55:47.480 --> 01:55:51.440]  in the journal pediatric there have been widespread concerns that mercury-based
[01:55:51.440 --> 01:55:55.600]  preservatives and vaccines might impair the neurological development of children
[01:55:55.600 --> 01:55:59.280]  these new studies suggest that the opposite that the preservatives may
[01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:03.280]  actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance all
[01:56:03.280 --> 01:56:07.720]  right let me cuz I know that sounded crazy Dan and candy spits well when I
[01:56:07.720 --> 01:56:11.480]  said that but so I thought you might want to hear that pretty amazing what do
[01:56:11.480 --> 01:56:14.720]  you think of that it's not as crazy as what I just heard a few weeks ago being
[01:56:14.720 --> 01:56:19.400]  I am the co-founder of the band anthrax that they have the vaccine now being
[01:56:19.400 --> 01:56:22.920]  tested or slightly or approved or whatever it is that they're putting
[01:56:22.920 --> 01:56:26.840]  anthrax in your buddies by the way which as you know they want to give it a
[01:56:26.840 --> 01:56:30.560]  little kids now they had to suspend three times giving it to troops that
[01:56:30.560 --> 01:56:35.600]  killed so many people sure why not right well hell I mean if your child has a
[01:56:35.600 --> 01:56:39.520]  convulsion they'll just I'm sure you know that the shaken baby thing they did
[01:56:39.520 --> 01:56:43.520]  studies in Australia it was really the shots they put monitors on them but they
[01:56:43.520 --> 01:56:47.640]  never want that info out here not only do they kill your kid or hurt them then
[01:56:47.640 --> 01:56:52.880]  they get to put you in jail it's even better yeah well you know because it
[01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:57.040]  costs what three to five point four million dollars per child who's on the
[01:56:57.040 --> 01:57:03.360]  autism spectrum to raise them just to an early age we have two oh yeah that's
[01:57:03.360 --> 01:57:08.040]  some cashola uh-huh well that's the reason no one's ever going to I said no
[01:57:08.040 --> 01:57:12.600]  matter what you think causes autism even if it's yes if it's vaccines
[01:57:12.600 --> 01:57:16.960]  environmental anything that's government related it's never going to come out the
[01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:21.100]  gravy train fighting it because that's what said the actual funding they say to
[01:57:21.100 --> 01:57:25.360]  raise a child from birth to 18 alone is three to five million dollars for one
[01:57:25.360 --> 01:57:30.680]  child with autism well it's also meant to collapse families like collapsing
[01:57:30.680 --> 01:57:34.240]  healthcare you got children with I mean tell folks what you go through with
[01:57:34.240 --> 01:57:40.160]  autistic children it's even worse let me say this you know the worst part of all
[01:57:40.160 --> 01:57:45.480]  of this is there's a 90% almost divorce rate of families with a special needs
[01:57:45.480 --> 01:57:49.320]  child because not only is there this financial burden usually one parent
[01:57:49.320 --> 01:57:53.520]  cannot work they have to be a full-time caretaker no it's a torpedo to destroy
[01:57:53.520 --> 01:57:57.000]  the family yeah there is you know there's your this financial problems
[01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:00.720]  are stressors that I mean we can't even begin you know I actually have my own

[02:10:10.280 --> 02:10:15.840]  for not organizing mass aggressive rallies I don't know how I've had I've
[02:10:15.840 --> 02:10:20.400]  done big rallies I've stormed the capital over the TSA I mean I know
[02:10:20.400 --> 02:10:24.680]  authoritarianism and I'm desperate because I have empathy ladies and
[02:10:24.680 --> 02:10:31.620]  gentlemen when I know people and see their children hurt and then I know it's
[02:10:31.620 --> 02:10:36.240]  all on purpose and I've got all the UN documents and we made films and and and
[02:10:36.240 --> 02:10:40.200]  all the quotes and Bertrand Russell how they'd use vaccines to dumb down the
[02:10:40.200 --> 02:10:45.720]  public and they're just killing us and maiming us thousands of kids die you're
[02:10:45.720 --> 02:10:50.840]  about I mean it's just incredible and then it's all a lie it's all a hoax and
[02:10:50.840 --> 02:10:55.360]  there even is real science for autoimmune stuff where you actually could
[02:10:55.360 --> 02:10:59.480]  have some vaccines it's a real science doesn't mean it might not be linked to
[02:10:59.480 --> 02:11:02.800]  other problems or stunting your immune system or doing other things but you
[02:11:02.800 --> 02:11:05.480]  know it's a real science if there was something out there killing people in
[02:11:05.480 --> 02:11:10.760]  mass but you know but polio had cancer virus in it the vaccine so so I'm
[02:11:10.760 --> 02:11:15.480]  ranting we've got our guest here the reason I get so upset is the magnitude
[02:11:15.480 --> 02:11:22.560]  of the evil is so great that the average person can't even believe it I mean just
[02:11:22.560 --> 02:11:27.080]  type in Harvard study fluoride they knew a hundred years ago sodium fluoride in
[02:11:27.080 --> 02:11:30.620]  the dosages that are in the water causes brain damage they know mercury is one of
[02:11:30.620 --> 02:11:34.280]  the most tested things ever because it's been used industrially for thousands of
[02:11:34.280 --> 02:11:39.160]  years they know an electrochemical reactions from electron microscopes that
[02:11:39.160 --> 02:11:43.300]  it is the most destructive heavy metal in the brain in fact guys go to YouTube
[02:11:43.300 --> 02:11:49.040]  and type in electron electron microscope mercury and brain tissue it's the
[02:11:49.040 --> 02:11:52.240]  University of Calgary is one of the better shots and it's the only heavy
[02:11:52.240 --> 02:11:56.880]  metal that actually makes a chain reaction happen and and and and causes
[02:11:56.880 --> 02:12:02.640]  chain reactions of the cells to actually blow out this is electrochemical lead
[02:12:02.640 --> 02:12:09.160]  mercury arsenic even suicide cyanide doesn't do that and yeah here it is
[02:12:09.160 --> 02:12:15.120]  this is faculty of medicine and they actually a show what mercury does we're
[02:12:15.120 --> 02:12:18.080]  going to show that this is what they say is good for your brain I played that
[02:12:18.080 --> 02:12:21.840]  last hour they say mercury is good for your child's brain ladies and gentlemen
[02:12:21.840 --> 02:12:26.560]  it is hyper destructive so going back to the founder of anthrax a dance pitch and
[02:12:26.560 --> 02:12:31.800]  candy his wife who heads up autism speaks for dot org what else do you
[02:12:31.800 --> 02:12:37.000]  want to impart to people solutions ideas if there's no law to take shots fight
[02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:41.520]  them trying to make it the law learn that the flu shot actually doubles your
[02:12:41.520 --> 02:12:45.080]  chances of getting flu that's major studies what else do you want to impart
[02:12:45.080 --> 02:12:49.160]  to people right now all you can really do is educate yourself there's nothing
[02:12:49.160 --> 02:12:53.880]  that we can do as a people to stop this and that's why I said you know I'm the
[02:12:53.880 --> 02:12:57.160]  spokesperson for autism speaks and the reason I dedicate my time this is not a
[02:12:57.160 --> 02:13:00.520]  paying job they don't you know this is not something I'm being forced to do I
[02:13:00.520 --> 02:13:05.200]  dedicated my life to this organization because Bob and Suzanne right who founded
[02:13:05.200 --> 02:13:08.280]  autism speaks are out there actually doing exactly what you're saying they're
[02:13:08.280 --> 02:13:13.040]  searching for every possible connection whether it be government related vaccine
[02:13:13.040 --> 02:13:17.280]  related environmental whatever this is they're out there doing it so let them
[02:13:17.280 --> 02:13:21.040]  do their job and they do a very good job of this and you know I said I'm
[02:13:21.040 --> 02:13:24.520]  personally involved in that level but you as a parent you as a society you as
[02:13:24.520 --> 02:13:29.280]  a teacher educator educate yourself learn your options know if you do need
[02:13:29.280 --> 02:13:33.080]  to vaccinate if you don't need to vaccinate if you suspect something what
[02:13:33.080 --> 02:13:37.560]  you can do right now while the kids are still young to fix this problem a lot of
[02:13:37.560 --> 02:13:43.520]  our problems are correctable it is not a cure but they are correctable and you as
[02:13:43.520 --> 02:13:47.540]  a parent need to take responsibility for your own child every child is different
[02:13:47.540 --> 02:13:50.280]  there's not going to be you know you've seen one child with autism you've seen
[02:13:50.280 --> 02:13:55.520]  one child with autism you need to learn how to make your family work how to work
[02:13:55.520 --> 02:14:00.800]  into their world you they are never going to fit into our society all of our
[02:14:00.800 --> 02:14:04.400]  children they are very highly intelligent in their own way and you
[02:14:04.400 --> 02:14:09.080]  need to find a way to adapt them into you into their world so all I can say is
[02:14:09.080 --> 02:14:12.320]  educate yourself learn the steps you know there's a lot of organizations
[02:14:12.320 --> 02:14:16.160]  autism speaks is not the only one out there but we put the facts out there
[02:14:16.160 --> 02:14:19.280]  everything good and bad is on the website there's tool kits they're gonna
[02:14:19.280 --> 02:14:22.840]  help you and if they can't help you they're gonna guide you to who can help
[02:14:22.840 --> 02:14:27.600]  you so just educate yourself and that's what I'm trying to do with with red lamb
[02:14:27.600 --> 02:14:31.960]  which is the project that the bean and Dave Mustaine have together and I took
[02:14:31.960 --> 02:14:35.920]  that on the road and you know we had sponsors wrap our boss to bring
[02:14:35.920 --> 02:14:40.320]  awareness into the heavy metal community where you know we all do think take
[02:14:40.320 --> 02:14:43.520]  things into our hand we're quite that's right big things have small beginnings
[02:14:43.520 --> 02:14:46.360]  because a lot of heavy metal guys I'll probably ignore you because they're
[02:14:46.360 --> 02:14:49.160]  young and they're not worried about it they're gonna get married they're gonna
[02:14:49.160 --> 02:14:52.660]  have a kid their kids gonna go into a convulsion and then they're gonna go
[02:14:52.660 --> 02:14:55.720]  completely haywire they're gonna save millions of other kids yeah but you
[02:14:55.720 --> 02:14:58.000]  know what they're gonna do is go hey wait a minute hey wait a minute there's
[02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:01.780]  that spits kids from anthrax red lamb whatever that was he his kids have
[02:15:01.780 --> 02:15:05.320]  autism and I remember something about that kid you know look him up and you
[02:15:05.320 --> 02:15:08.480]  know what that's what I'm trying no no I agree you're trying to save them but I'm
[02:15:08.480 --> 02:15:13.840]  saying there's still even more that aren't gonna listen right now they trust
[02:15:13.840 --> 02:15:17.440]  the government they're listening right now and they're gonna go out and get the
[02:15:17.440 --> 02:15:22.600]  shot and they're gonna see it happen you gotta kind of try to untrain the monkey
[02:15:22.600 --> 02:15:24.920]  a little bit if you know what I'm trying to say and that's that's what I'm
[02:15:24.920 --> 02:15:29.000]  trying to do well there's nothing you can really do right now to stop this
[02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:33.280]  from happening because there are so many different possible causes you know
[02:15:33.280 --> 02:15:38.240]  there's no way you can't avoid you know food water you know shots you can't
[02:15:38.240 --> 02:15:41.240]  avoid everything out there and some of this is genetic there's a small portion
[02:15:41.240 --> 02:15:44.440]  of people with autism who are born genetically with autism there's fragile
[02:15:44.440 --> 02:15:48.360]  acts there's other there's other forms so there's nothing you can do to stop it
[02:15:48.360 --> 02:15:53.200]  so you just need to know what to do once it's in your face because even if you
[02:15:53.200 --> 02:15:57.160]  don't have a child sure but we have the causal of effect and all the studies
[02:15:57.160 --> 02:16:02.480]  that the vaccines are the big Kahuna obviously pesticide bisphenol a
[02:16:02.480 --> 02:16:07.280]  additives aspartame aspartame and you know in the drinks for the babies I mean
[02:16:07.280 --> 02:16:11.520]  just insane stuff but I mean I've had all the top scientists on I know you've
[02:16:11.520 --> 02:16:17.640]  interviewed them you've talked to them we all doctors know in and also vets in
[02:16:17.640 --> 02:16:23.720]  animal husbandry that female mammals are stronger than male mammals I don't mean
[02:16:23.720 --> 02:16:28.400]  physically obviously but but but but women can be shot more times women can
[02:16:28.400 --> 02:16:32.840]  be starved longer because women are designed to have babies women have a
[02:16:32.840 --> 02:16:37.160]  much stronger immune system boys can't handle the mercury right in the
[02:16:37.160 --> 02:16:41.040]  bloodstream that's why it's hitting the boys and so yes genetically genetically
[02:16:41.040 --> 02:16:44.680]  they're predisposed to be hurt by it well that's why I say when I do meet
[02:16:44.680 --> 02:16:48.080]  people or we talk to people who are in that realm of thinking about having a
[02:16:48.080 --> 02:16:53.960]  child or under the 12-month level and they have a boy you know be aware is he
[02:16:53.960 --> 02:16:57.920]  developing slower than normal just in general immune system did he have a
[02:16:57.920 --> 02:17:02.080]  colic or whatever it may be you know what you know find a way to deter those
[02:17:02.080 --> 02:17:05.640]  shots go somewhere where you they can be spread out over a longer period of time
[02:17:05.640 --> 02:17:10.200]  and take that simple precaution at least in that one area yeah but see my I got
[02:17:10.200 --> 02:17:13.480]  three children they've never had a vaccine sorry go ahead candy no more
[02:17:13.480 --> 02:17:17.400]  importantly just trust your instincts do not rely on you know medical
[02:17:17.400 --> 02:17:21.680]  professionals teachers doctors anybody out there trust your instinct as a parent
[02:17:21.680 --> 02:17:25.760]  you know what's best whether it's food what you know water vaccine whatever it
[02:17:25.760 --> 02:17:28.880]  happens to be you know what's best so just trust your own instincts sure what
[02:17:28.880 --> 02:17:33.640]  about Bill Gates coming out with clothes and and and fruit and and and other
[02:17:33.640 --> 02:17:37.960]  produce where it's in there and you don't have a choice because we don't
[02:17:37.960 --> 02:17:41.160]  know best they're gonna force all these high-tech vaccines have you heard about
[02:17:41.160 --> 02:17:45.840]  the anti-drug vaccines that actually eat parts of the brain so you can never
[02:17:45.840 --> 02:17:54.840]  upload alcohol or cocaine what's the heavy metal people gonna do oh boy well
[02:17:54.840 --> 02:17:58.320]  it actually gives you a type of lobotomy because those same receptors take on
[02:17:58.320 --> 02:18:03.720]  endorphins look up my video brain-eating vaccines and I gave it a Hollywood name
[02:18:03.720 --> 02:18:08.200]  so people watch it brain-eating vaccines and it actually shows all the documents
[02:18:08.200 --> 02:18:12.440]  they're saying soon you won't ever worry again because you're gonna have no
[02:18:12.440 --> 02:18:17.160]  emotion sounds like body snatchers doesn't it wow that's scary that's
[02:18:17.160 --> 02:18:21.080]  crazy there's nothing you can do to avoid some of what's going on right now
[02:18:21.080 --> 02:18:25.520]  so that's why the two of us our main mission is not to you know fund research
[02:18:25.520 --> 02:18:29.120]  we're not out there fundraising for anything nothing for the band you're
[02:18:29.120 --> 02:18:32.700]  just warning people it's more now it's just awareness and advocacy because the
[02:18:32.700 --> 02:18:36.720]  face of society is about to change in the next 20 years everybody will have
[02:18:36.720 --> 02:18:42.280]  something ADD ADHD OCD autism everything is changing because they're poisoning us
[02:18:42.280 --> 02:18:47.080]  you learn you need to learn how to function as a hope now there's there's a
[02:18:47.080 --> 02:18:50.660]  whole new way of thinking and the old ways of you know tantrums and
[02:18:50.660 --> 02:18:54.400]  meltdowns and what people thought before it just doesn't exist the world has
[02:18:54.400 --> 02:18:58.720]  changed yeah the new world orders here if you think if you think it doesn't
[02:18:58.720 --> 02:19:02.280]  then in about 25 minutes when candy picks up our children you're all welcome

[02:25:57.220 --> 02:26:00.680]  nightmares I'm gonna be honest with you one time Mike Hansen we were this family
[02:26:00.680 --> 02:26:04.120]  was about to have a baby they had no criminal record he was an auto mechanic
[02:26:04.120 --> 02:26:07.480]  they lived in a they were living in a hotel while they moved to another
[02:26:07.480 --> 02:26:11.440]  apartment and they came and she was blonde hair blue-eyed so was he those
[02:26:11.440 --> 02:26:19.640]  babies can get a half million and I'll never forget I'll never forget we were
[02:26:19.640 --> 02:26:22.760]  talking the family they were listeners they called in the show they said CPS is
[02:26:22.760 --> 02:26:25.840]  saying they're gonna take the baby when it's born or might they called the show
[02:26:25.840 --> 02:26:29.200]  they gave Mike Hansen cell phone number when he was running the access TV show
[02:26:29.200 --> 02:26:36.800]  this is like 15 years ago 16 years ago and they called Mike one day
[02:26:36.800 --> 02:26:38.800]  and
[02:26:42.480 --> 02:26:49.600]  when we went down there we opened the door as the police had got there and
[02:26:49.600 --> 02:26:54.960]  a cop was choking the woman's literally like a movie red-handed with his hands
[02:26:54.960 --> 02:27:00.640]  on her neck going shine it shine it and the dad was kept outside and the cop
[02:27:00.640 --> 02:27:06.000]  looked up at me and he looked like a bad guy out of a movie you know like a guy
[02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:11.320]  you see creeping around parks or something and it hit me and and my whole
[02:27:11.320 --> 02:27:17.600]  instinct was defend that woman but I knew he knew America's mine I got this
[02:27:17.600 --> 02:27:23.760]  kid boom I'm on it like a wolf and I knew and then I famously you know went
[02:27:23.760 --> 02:27:26.800]  and called into a local talk show and broke down and people thought it was it
[02:27:26.800 --> 02:27:29.960]  was my children being taken they're like well he said it was somebody else's kid
[02:27:29.960 --> 02:27:34.680]  why is he so upset that was like howling crying and it's because I realized
[02:27:34.680 --> 02:27:39.160]  they're gonna kill everybody they're gonna listen listen what they didn't get
[02:27:39.160 --> 02:27:43.840]  is you notice he was saying well it's a change of life now it's now one in fifty
[02:27:43.840 --> 02:27:48.400]  from one in 25,000 and it's gonna be one in ten and then one in two and this is
[02:27:48.400 --> 02:27:54.560]  just the way we are and you can't stop it did you hear you can't stop that it's
[02:27:54.560 --> 02:27:59.560]  coming to you and see that's the PR being put out this is just a way of life
[02:27:59.560 --> 02:28:03.000]  like she's been through it she's saying at a subconscious level you will now
[02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:06.360]  drink of this cup no I won't
[02:28:06.680 --> 02:28:10.600]  but listen to the cops everybody you're all gonna die young too you're all gonna
[02:28:10.600 --> 02:28:13.800]  get neurological disorders people are getting Alzheimer's at 45 now they just

[02:28:30.640 --> 02:28:35.720]  point I'm trying to find the avenue of attack on these people I'm trying to
[02:28:35.720 --> 02:28:44.200]  find the life force lever to flip in you where you get some simple survival
[02:28:44.200 --> 02:28:47.280]  instinct I mean they have Lone Star College down in Houston the same place
[02:28:47.280 --> 02:28:50.640]  two gang bangers shot each other and they said take the guns now somebody
[02:28:50.640 --> 02:28:53.720]  stabbed twelve people with a one-inch exacto knife and they're talking about
[02:28:53.720 --> 02:28:58.160]  banning exacto knives because there's because society's a bunch of idiots
[02:28:58.160 --> 02:29:04.080]  stabbing each other and it's big news oh my gosh and there's police and armed
[02:29:04.080 --> 02:29:08.920]  guards at that inner city college I mean that that college is in the middle of

[02:29:13.640 --> 02:29:17.280]  citizens of Houston have guns to protect themselves or it'd be like Chicago where
[02:29:17.280 --> 02:29:20.960]  killers are just killing everybody I mean they are sitting there with the
[02:29:20.960 --> 02:29:25.600]  exacto knife on TV with his doctor salivating over discussing the exacto
[02:29:25.600 --> 02:29:33.960]  knife and getting people to basically freak out in fear over it a citizen
[02:29:33.960 --> 02:29:37.480]  with a one-inch knife oh they fall in fear because they're such cowards people
[02:29:37.480 --> 02:29:39.880]  now when a coyote comes out in the park they fall down and it kills them

[02:36:48.520 --> 02:36:53.000]  the ultimate tyranny but see America kind of has a parallel running like like
[02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:56.160]  the old liberties being destroyed while the new tyranny is expanding there's
[02:36:56.160 --> 02:37:01.800]  like two railroad tracks here so we're gonna be breaking all of that down now
[02:37:01.800 --> 02:37:08.400]  shifting gears here ladies and gentlemen is a natural news dot-com story you can
[02:37:08.400 --> 02:37:13.320]  also find up at info wars calm and I want to be clear here with Mike Adams
[02:37:13.320 --> 02:37:16.920]  and I know he's being clear as well we support digital fiat currencies gold
[02:37:16.920 --> 02:37:21.800]  currencies silver currencies open-source currencies free currencies diverse
[02:37:21.800 --> 02:37:25.960]  currencies not just the private Federal Reserve Federal Reserve note that
[02:37:25.960 --> 02:37:30.760]  masquerade good masquerades as the dollar I want to be a hundred and ten
[02:37:30.760 --> 02:37:37.920]  percent clear right now about that my issue is my spidey since months ago or a
[02:37:37.920 --> 02:37:41.120]  year ago when this first started getting hype when everybody's talking about it
[02:37:41.120 --> 02:37:45.960]  you know when did Kennedy's dad Joe Kennedy say he got out of the stock
[02:37:45.960 --> 02:37:49.200]  market when a shoeshine boy that day before it crashed holding you know told
[02:37:49.200 --> 02:37:51.920]  him you know what stock to buy actually he was an insider and Warren but that
[02:37:51.920 --> 02:37:56.720]  was kind of his his story everybody's getting into Bitcoin and it's foggy
[02:37:56.720 --> 02:38:00.920]  where it came from I'm sure some good libertarians are involved but this can
[02:38:00.920 --> 02:38:07.040]  be used just like they used a fake test to discredit alternative energy back in
[02:38:07.040 --> 02:38:12.200]  the 80s to try to discredit and then outlaw digital open-source currencies
[02:38:12.200 --> 02:38:17.720]  and I'm very very worried about this up front I've not bought any I could tell
[02:38:17.720 --> 02:38:20.440]  it was going to go up the way it was just being hyped and pushed in ways I
[02:38:20.440 --> 02:38:26.400]  didn't understand and I'm very very suspicious of the whole thing and again
[02:38:26.400 --> 02:38:31.440]  they've gone completely parabolic it's going straight up right now there's new
[02:38:31.440 --> 02:38:34.680]  documents out of the central banks are artificially depressing gold and silver
[02:38:34.680 --> 02:38:39.880]  to keep the bond market up and to cover up inflation so this is going straight
[02:38:39.880 --> 02:38:43.880]  up while gold and silver is being driven down a bit right now which I see as a
[02:38:43.880 --> 02:38:48.360]  buying opportunity and again I'm not against fiat currencies if their private
[02:38:48.360 --> 02:38:52.240]  public transparent and have a somewhat of a history and I get well it has to
[02:38:52.240 --> 02:38:56.640]  have a history by being born exactly and the globalist will want to strangle
[02:38:56.640 --> 02:39:01.400]  these little babies in the crib or at least give them an a injection to dumb
[02:39:01.400 --> 02:39:05.680]  them down so they won't be trouble it's kind like a lion killing baby male
[02:39:05.680 --> 02:39:10.340]  lions or a grizzly killing baby male Grizzlies you know the globalists do
[02:39:10.340 --> 02:39:13.640]  this to you now they make sure the boys are brain damaged so you won't give them
[02:39:13.640 --> 02:39:17.800]  any trouble before the big robot roll out the soft kill operation so Mike
[02:39:17.800 --> 02:39:23.480]  Adams of natural news pops in to get he's a smart business guy on many fronts
[02:39:23.480 --> 02:39:27.440]  I tend to respect his opinion well I don't tend to I haven't found anything I
[02:39:27.440 --> 02:39:31.480]  disagree with Mike Adams on that's rare to say this group myself more half the
[02:39:31.480 --> 02:39:35.120]  time listening rebroadcast I'll do with him Mike what is your take on this and
[02:39:35.120 --> 02:39:40.280]  why are you saying the Bitcoin bubble by speculative Bitcoin buy-ins now point to
[02:39:40.280 --> 02:39:45.280]  a disastrous Bitcoin crash Mike Adams of natural news.com hi Alex thanks for
[02:39:45.280 --> 02:39:49.600]  having me on and I'm glad you pointed out that we both are supporters of a
[02:39:49.600 --> 02:39:54.040]  decentralized peer-to-peer cryptocurrency in theory the idea is
[02:39:54.040 --> 02:39:58.520]  wonderful we need competition for the central banks so I'm not anti Bitcoin
[02:39:58.520 --> 02:40:02.400]  and I want to be very very clear about that in fact we promoted it I mean our
[02:40:02.400 --> 02:40:07.000]  story even accepts bitcoins you know we want people in bitcoins overall but
[02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:12.640]  what's happening now is it has converted it's become too popular too quickly it
[02:40:12.640 --> 02:40:17.360]  has become a mania by the way you know I privately predicted that to you you did
[02:40:17.360 --> 02:40:23.720]  yes you did you're exactly right on I smell something here well it could be
[02:40:23.720 --> 02:40:28.160]  that it's just people jumping on board I mean we're seeing this you know we have
[02:40:28.160 --> 02:40:31.900]  an office in Asia and we've we've been getting inside reports that in China now
[02:40:31.900 --> 02:40:36.920]  this is the new casino buy bitcoins ride it you know buy it low and sell it high
[02:40:36.920 --> 02:40:41.320]  this is a speculative bubble in the making it doesn't mean it's going to
[02:40:41.320 --> 02:40:46.360]  crash tomorrow it may still go much much higher it could reach 500 it could reach
[02:40:46.360 --> 02:40:51.200]  a thousand even ten thousand dollars a Bitcoin but eventually it's going to
[02:40:51.200 --> 02:40:58.200]  crash hard and I bet my reputation on that Alex I am 100% sure we're going to
[02:40:58.200 --> 02:41:04.200]  see a massive Bitcoin crash at some point with an ultra accelerated velocity
[02:41:04.200 --> 02:41:08.040]  of the crash it will be the fastest crash of any currency in the history of
[02:41:08.040 --> 02:41:11.720]  human civilization and there are mathematical reasons for that that I've
[02:41:11.720 --> 02:41:14.480]  tried to lay out in the story that I just published I think it's up on
[02:41:14.480 --> 02:41:19.720]  infowars but it will be a high-velocity crash the reason is because people are
[02:41:19.720 --> 02:41:23.760]  buying bitcoins who don't know what bitcoins are and who have no use for
[02:41:23.760 --> 02:41:27.600]  them these are speculators they're buying bitcoins in the same way that
[02:41:27.600 --> 02:41:34.640]  people bought tulip bulbs in the tulip bulb mania of I think 1637 it's going to
[02:41:34.640 --> 02:41:38.440]  be the same thing it's just a new vehicle and it's going to crash bitcoins
[02:41:38.440 --> 02:41:43.000]  eventually at which point they will become a good value to buy once the
[02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:49.280]  crash has happened Alex go over some more of the mathematics for people all
[02:41:49.280 --> 02:41:53.240]  right well everybody who's holding bitcoins right now believes that their
[02:41:53.240 --> 02:41:58.480]  bitcoins are worth 200 210 dollars because that's the latest market price
[02:41:58.480 --> 02:42:02.800]  for the bitcoins so there has been literally hundreds of millions of
[02:42:02.800 --> 02:42:06.880]  dollars in valuation that has been artificially created by the ramp up in
[02:42:06.880 --> 02:42:10.680]  bitcoin prices so everyone who holds bitcoins thinks all their bitcoins are
[02:42:10.680 --> 02:42:16.120]  worth that and in a grand total it's well over a billion dollars in truth
[02:42:16.120 --> 02:42:20.560]  though once a sell-off begins the greed that is currently pushing the market
[02:42:20.560 --> 02:42:26.680]  upwards will transition into fear the price support will falter the fear will
[02:42:26.680 --> 02:42:31.160]  start a sell-off the sell-off will start to devalue the holdings that current
[02:42:31.160 --> 02:42:35.320]  people have in bitcoins once they see their money dropping down they're going
[02:42:35.320 --> 02:42:38.240]  to start selling that's right slow growth is always the healthiest when
[02:42:38.240 --> 02:42:42.560]  something goes straight up like an Atlas rocket it's going to go it's going to go
[02:42:42.560 --> 02:42:46.920]  straight down and you already see them putting money laundering rules on to it
[02:42:46.920 --> 02:42:52.160]  just preparing to try to then outlaw any competing digital currency because the
[02:42:52.160 --> 02:42:57.120]  globalists are actually going to go themselves on record to a global SDR
[02:42:57.120 --> 02:43:02.400]  backed up by carbon taxes wellhead taxes and money transfer Tobin taxes so they
[02:43:02.400 --> 02:43:06.160]  will try to strangle this in the crib they may even be pumping money into it
[02:43:06.160 --> 02:43:11.080]  so that they can then dump it later I mean if they didn't look I think like
[02:43:11.080 --> 02:43:15.120]  the enemy if I was the enemy I do that exactly the central banks will be very
[02:43:15.120 --> 02:43:18.840]  smart right now to be buying bitcoins pushing it up making it very very
[02:43:18.840 --> 02:43:22.720]  popular getting as many people on board as possible and then when the timing is
[02:43:22.720 --> 02:43:27.600]  right do a mass sell-off of bitcoins flood the marketplace with massive
[02:43:27.600 --> 02:43:32.560]  supply of bitcoins causing a crash causing bitcoins to be discredited so
[02:43:32.560 --> 02:43:37.760]  that no one ever trust a decentralized non-government run currency again that's
[02:43:37.760 --> 02:43:42.600]  the brilliant evil tactic of the central bankers who we know are deeply engaged
[02:43:42.600 --> 02:43:46.600]  in psychological warfare and market manipulations so I think they are
[02:43:46.600 --> 02:43:50.720]  involved right now I'm gonna get to some other news whether you want to get your
[02:43:50.720 --> 02:43:55.840]  take on here North Korea and Obama bugging the phones through Mother Jones
[02:43:55.840 --> 02:44:00.640]  that's basically a White House front of Congress I mean of course they are
[02:44:00.640 --> 02:44:04.760]  that's what the NSA is for I want to talk about that with you in a moment but
[02:44:04.760 --> 02:44:08.720]  first off any other points you want to make about Bitcoin well just remember
[02:44:08.720 --> 02:44:12.080]  that right now what's driving the Bitcoin market is greed the idea that
[02:44:12.080 --> 02:44:17.000]  you can buy low and sell high greed will turn to fear as it has always done Alex
[02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:22.000]  in the tulip bulb bubble in the dot-com bubble that I also publicly predicted
[02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:26.000]  that it was going to crash two years before it did and I know you did as well
[02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:29.840]  and in the housing bubble every bubble in history has the same psychological
[02:44:29.840 --> 02:44:34.360]  profile eventually greed will turn to fear fear will turn to panic and
[02:44:34.360 --> 02:44:40.800]  remember that the the Wall Street stock markets they have limits of how quickly
[02:44:40.800 --> 02:44:45.400]  a stock can drop in a day they will close the market if it limits down too
[02:44:45.400 --> 02:44:49.720]  much so you have a limit down and a cooling off period overnight Bitcoin has
[02:44:49.720 --> 02:44:54.800]  no limits there's no cooling period that's why when the crash begins it will
[02:44:54.800 --> 02:45:00.080]  be the most rapid high-velocity crash of any currency in history that's going to
[02:45:00.080 --> 02:45:04.920]  happen it's just a matter of when oh and one more important point Alex there are
[02:45:04.920 --> 02:45:08.920]  some very very smart people who are going to get very rich off of this who
[02:45:08.920 --> 02:45:13.400]  have built-in algorithms to sell Bitcoin when it drops below a certain fixed
[02:45:13.400 --> 02:45:18.920]  market value it's an automated you know computerized selling system they're
[02:45:18.920 --> 02:45:21.880]  going to make money because they'll be able to get out but the result of that
[02:45:21.880 --> 02:45:26.600]  system is that will it will accelerate the downward spiral of prices faster
[02:45:26.600 --> 02:45:30.080]  than most humans can respond you're going to see the Bitcoin exchanges
[02:45:30.080 --> 02:45:34.200]  overloaded during the crash and people won't be able to get out until the value
[02:45:34.200 --> 02:45:38.360]  is what's your gut tell you because if it happens to minor glitches I think to
[02:45:38.360 --> 02:45:43.320]  train people to stay in when it finally mega plunges to deliver the maximum
[02:45:43.320 --> 02:45:47.080]  profit to the insiders I mean is it possible that Bitcoin could have been
[02:45:47.080 --> 02:45:53.680]  created by the system itself my gut tells me that it wasn't I think it was
[02:45:53.680 --> 02:46:00.000]  probably created by some some libertarian minded math mathematicians
[02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:04.440]  who by the way right now are billionaires for sure but it can be
[02:46:04.440 --> 02:46:07.320]  manipulated by the central banks in the system and I think it is being
[02:46:07.320 --> 02:46:11.560]  manipulated and my gut tells me that this may go considerably higher still
[02:46:11.560 --> 02:46:16.920]  but the higher it goes the worse the crash is going to be and the the
[02:46:16.920 --> 02:46:21.120]  ultimate goal is to discredit Bitcoin which I am against I'm a proponent of
[02:46:21.120 --> 02:46:25.120]  this absolutely but but the operatives will spin it that were against it okay I
[02:46:25.120 --> 02:46:29.040]  want to shift gears with you you've got a lot of contacts in Asia I know I've
[02:46:29.040 --> 02:46:33.000]  never seen rhetoric like this Korea saying we're gonna blow up Japan South
[02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:36.680]  Korea and the US obviously can't hit the US may be able to hit Japan or South
[02:46:36.680 --> 02:46:40.720]  Korea obviously with their artillery 10,000 plus pieces no doubt I mean the
[02:46:40.720 --> 02:46:44.440]  perfect example of a collapsing psychopaths with a bunch of weapons who
[02:46:44.440 --> 02:46:47.520]  can't even tie their shoelaces but have weapons because that's all they need
[02:46:47.520 --> 02:46:50.520]  they want the guns the people don't you know that's why Obama wants the guns
[02:46:50.520 --> 02:46:55.880]  threatening South Korea that's just an exploding fastest growing economy in the
[02:46:55.880 --> 02:46:59.160]  world undoubtedly I mean this is unprecedented saying we're loading the
[02:46:59.160 --> 02:47:02.720]  missiles tomorrow and you know saying things like and you will be destroyed I
[02:47:02.720 --> 02:47:07.840]  mean this is unprecedented well as we talked about when I was a guest there in
[02:47:07.840 --> 02:47:13.120]  studio last week with you I believe that America has the right at this point the
[02:47:13.120 --> 02:47:17.400]  moral justification to go ahead and strike Korea North Korea's leadership
[02:47:17.400 --> 02:47:21.480]  and we're always anti-war cuz we're not for invading Iraq that's done nothing or
[02:47:21.480 --> 02:47:24.760]  putting al-qaeda and living in Syria when somebody says I have nukes they're
[02:47:24.760 --> 02:47:29.520]  aimed I'm gonna launch them on you boom yes I'm sorry go ahead but we have to
[02:47:29.520 --> 02:47:32.880]  make sure if that happens and and this is the one case in which I absolutely
[02:47:32.880 --> 02:47:37.440]  agree with the Pentagon to go in and do you might call it a preemptive strike
[02:47:37.440 --> 02:47:41.200]  but it's really a self-defense strike I believe in the right to self-defense I
[02:47:41.200 --> 02:47:44.440]  believe in that right for school teachers at schools for individuals
[02:47:44.440 --> 02:47:48.120]  carrying handguns and for nations to defend themselves against tyrants who
[02:47:48.120 --> 02:47:51.520]  are threatening to strike them with nuclear weapons it's the same philosophy
[02:47:51.520 --> 02:47:54.760]  just at a large and China has backed off North Korea and told him to stop it I
[02:47:54.760 --> 02:47:59.120]  mean I think they should tell them one more threat to nuke Japan or South Korea
[02:47:59.120 --> 02:48:03.640]  or us and I mean you just decapitate his government I mean they've got all the
[02:48:03.640 --> 02:48:07.560]  weapons they don't want to show those I mean but they can decapitate them with
[02:48:07.560 --> 02:48:12.960]  the meteor guns right now and what we need to do is is go in there wipe out
[02:48:12.960 --> 02:48:17.600]  the corrupt criminal North Korean leadership and deliver something
[02:48:17.600 --> 02:48:21.480]  resembling democracy to that country I know it's kind of hypocrisy since
[02:48:21.480 --> 02:48:26.040]  America seems to be abandoning democracy but at least don't the people of North
[02:48:26.040 --> 02:48:31.240]  Korea deserve such an example of pure evil that's why our government gave them
[02:48:31.240 --> 02:48:34.840]  the reactors in the mid 90s to make the a-bombs because our governments just as
[02:48:34.840 --> 02:48:40.960]  bad it's just they had richer people to build an empire off of well exactly but
[02:48:40.960 --> 02:48:44.720]  if there were ever a case a moral case for freeing people from enslavement
[02:48:44.720 --> 02:48:48.200]  through the use of military force this is it and that's why they won't do it
[02:48:48.200 --> 02:48:53.240]  and that's why they won't do it Obama loves Mao Tse-tung this is a Maoist
[02:48:53.240 --> 02:48:56.120]  state I mean I mean they absolutely he would love to set things up like this
[02:48:56.120 --> 02:48:59.680]  and yeah they're probably getting ideas from Kim Jong-un of how to run
[02:48:59.680 --> 02:49:06.440]  Washington next let me raise another issue here with you what do you think of
[02:49:06.440 --> 02:49:11.200]  the family having to flee to Cuba with their kids away from America the evil
[02:49:11.200 --> 02:49:15.240]  parents that kidnapped their own kids yeah well we're seeing many examples of
