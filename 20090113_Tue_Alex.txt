[08:06.560 --> 08:08.960]  network
[08:09.760 --> 08:13.760]  all right folks we are back it's the Alex Jones show I am Jason Bermas
[08:13.760 --> 08:17.720]  filmmaker of loose change final cut and of course fabled enemies you get both
[08:17.720 --> 08:21.760]  those at info wars dot com right now we got some guests on later we're gonna have
[08:21.760 --> 08:26.840]  Larry Pratt on gun owners of America that's the top of the hour one o'clock
[08:26.840 --> 08:30.600]  and then we're gonna we're gonna talk about this this food rate issue with
[08:30.600 --> 08:35.240]  Jonas Stoltzfuss and Maurice Thompson from two to three so stay tuned for that
[08:35.240 --> 08:40.760]  but right now we're talking about this Obama appointment they're also saying
[08:40.760 --> 08:44.120]  it's a Clinton appointment he'll be Clint's lead inquisitor yes because it's
[08:44.120 --> 08:48.400]  all the same team you know Obama was joking about putting Hillary on the
[08:48.400 --> 08:51.960]  administration David Gergen called it when he said that you know oh they're
[08:51.960 --> 08:55.640]  probably discussing whether or not she's going to get secretary of state or
[08:55.640 --> 08:59.680]  another position when he they ran off to the Bilderberg meeting well they're not
[08:59.680 --> 09:03.000]  really discussing it the powers that be are discussing it with them well what
[09:03.000 --> 09:07.000]  would you feel more comfortable in I mean well you feel like you're gonna be
[09:07.000 --> 09:09.360]  able to lie to the people three four times a week
[09:09.360 --> 09:12.720]  Obama you've already got to do it about six days a week but what do you think
[09:12.720 --> 09:16.760]  Hillary oh she's up to the task let's do it and then internationalist John Kerry
[09:16.760 --> 09:19.160]  because that's what he has foreign relations committee I mean come on these
[09:19.160 --> 09:23.680]  guys are all CFR which is the council on foreign relations do you think there's
[09:23.680 --> 09:28.520]  an overlap there oh and you know what I got to have Erin bring me in that one
[09:28.520 --> 09:34.400]  article I almost forgot I believe the person that Obama is has chosen for the
[09:34.400 --> 09:37.760]  environment is calling for global governance and of course she's not only
[09:37.760 --> 09:41.520]  calling for global governance she's doing so under the guise of global warming
[09:41.520 --> 09:44.840]  I'm so glad we talked about that yesterday and the carbon credits I believe
[09:44.840 --> 09:49.320]  that's out of the Washington Times is even reporting it the Washington Times
[09:49.320 --> 09:53.520]  you know what I'm going to I'm gonna grab that article but first I want to
[09:53.520 --> 10:01.640]  show you how interrelated Bush and Kerry are both of them again they are their
[10:01.640 --> 10:06.240]  skull and bones man so let's play both clips let's play Bush and then Kerry you
[10:06.240 --> 10:10.920]  were both in skull and bones the secret society it's so secret we can't talk about
[10:10.920 --> 10:16.440]  what does that mean for America the conspiracy theorists are gonna go I don't
[10:16.440 --> 10:27.240]  know I haven't seen the way number three to two scull and bones a secret
[10:27.240 --> 10:32.480]  society at Yale what does that tell us not much because it's a secret
[10:32.480 --> 10:39.440]  secret code I wish there were something secret I could manifest 322 secret
[10:39.440 --> 10:43.640]  number are there all kinds of secrets there are all kinds of secrets like
[10:43.640 --> 10:46.880]  though that I'll be throwing the election for George Bush and I'll be the
[10:46.880 --> 10:50.120]  head of the foreign relations committee in about four years so Tim if you're
[10:50.120 --> 10:54.800]  still around will be taught oh that's right you're not still around yikes
[10:54.800 --> 11:00.560]  yikes well it really doesn't matter that we got to get that global governance
[11:00.560 --> 11:03.640]  article in here so I can just show you know Bob doesn't seem to think it's a
[11:03.640 --> 11:07.200]  problem when it was exposed she was immediately pulled off their little on
[11:07.200 --> 11:11.600]  global governance website see this is about world government don't you haven't
[11:11.600 --> 11:15.000]  heard he's the world president that's what everybody's saying he's in the
[11:15.000 --> 11:24.240]  cover of the Rolling Stone he's a rock star he's not a president Bernanke more
[11:24.240 --> 11:28.000]  bailouts needed this is off a CNN money.com Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
[11:28.000 --> 11:31.520]  Bernanke said Tuesday that president-elect Barack Obama's proposed
[11:31.520 --> 11:35.640]  fiscal stimulus package could help the economy but he added that the additional
[11:35.640 --> 11:39.440]  bailouts of financial institutions may also be needed to bring about a
[11:39.440 --> 11:46.680]  sustained economy. Oh my god see the 800 billion plan isn't enough and the
[11:46.680 --> 11:51.680]  analogy he makes at the end is just totally ridiculous it's basically just
[11:51.680 --> 11:56.080]  like give me your money and don't ask about it you ready? It's good advice
[11:56.080 --> 12:00.000]  if in general if there's a fire burning you try to put it out first then you
[12:00.000 --> 12:04.000]  think about the fire code so that basically means let's not think about
[12:04.000 --> 12:09.920]  any of the laws let us steal absolutely everything absolutely everything what
[12:09.920 --> 12:14.160]  they're gonna do is they're gonna bill more banks out they're gonna give more
[12:14.160 --> 12:18.080]  infrastructure to the government and there and he says in this article also
[12:18.080 --> 12:21.760]  that they need to the chairman said it was also clear that there need to be
[12:21.760 --> 12:25.120]  changes in the regulation of financial institutions both in the United States
[12:25.120 --> 12:31.520]  and in coordination with governments around the world it's a world banking
[12:31.520 --> 12:36.240]  system it's under criminal elitist bankers international bankers
[12:36.240 --> 12:42.960]  bankers from other countries but you know what we don't mind you know we're
[12:42.960 --> 12:53.080]  just gonna sit back on our new our new Obama Pepsi's and and kick it this is
[12:53.080 --> 12:58.760]  out a new week Newsweek by the way this this is back I believe right before the
[12:58.760 --> 13:04.040]  election we need a bank of the world the financial crisis is global and only an
[13:04.040 --> 13:10.680]  international central bank can deal with it that's the headline the idea of such
[13:10.680 --> 13:14.520]  an institution would have been a political non-starter before the current
[13:14.520 --> 13:18.720]  debate debacle the crisis of the last several decades the Latin America debt
[13:18.720 --> 13:22.440]  meltdown in the early 80s the stock market crash in 87 the savings and loan
[13:22.440 --> 13:26.840]  collapse of the early 90s the Asian financial blow-up of the late 1990s
[13:26.840 --> 13:32.000]  blah blah blah nonsense they've engineered this they've brought in things
[13:32.000 --> 13:37.000]  like the IMF and World Bank as precursors to what they have planned
[13:37.000 --> 13:41.400]  there it is right there I know we're not on there but maybe in the tape it's
[13:41.400 --> 13:47.360]  unbelievable unbelievable so now today and in fact listeners I know I gave a big
[13:47.360 --> 13:51.160]  big big ups to BL for all this footage that he said and I want to do that again
[13:51.160 --> 13:55.720]  but we could really use some footage of whatever he says today if you can get the
[13:55.720 --> 14:01.280]  whole thing on c-span or MSNBC please put it to DVD record it and send it to us
[14:01.280 --> 14:07.440]  we need it Obama is gonna talk about the bailout for the first time today
[14:07.440 --> 14:10.920]  interesting president like Barack Obama will go to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to
[14:10.920 --> 14:14.280]  meet with Senate Democrats and make his case for how he wants to spend the second
[14:14.280 --> 14:18.120]  half of the 700 billion dollar ballot see they're still talking about a 700
[14:18.120 --> 14:21.920]  billion dollar bail it's in the trillions Bernanke's saying we're taking
[14:21.920 --> 14:27.320]  more I mean really I don't even know if it's going to be a finite amount of
[14:27.320 --> 14:33.480]  money I mean if you really think about it if they loan out enough of it you know
[14:33.480 --> 14:36.840]  they could probably just loan out more than they have or they're supposed to
[14:36.840 --> 14:42.560]  again and again again so you know maybe it'll be a hundred trillion before it's
[14:42.560 --> 14:47.720]  all over and we'll all have to give up our firstborn or they'll make it they'll
[14:47.720 --> 14:51.320]  make the excuse like China that we're so strained that we're only going to have
[14:51.320 --> 14:55.040]  one child births so instead of our firstborn being taken that's all you get
[14:55.040 --> 14:59.960]  and then you get sterilized will be delicious you know one of these guys
[14:59.960 --> 15:05.640]  bringing the bailout to us who I constantly see parading around the
[15:05.640 --> 15:13.160]  news is a guy named Barney Frank all right now Barney Frank I am utterly no
[15:13.160 --> 15:18.400]  fan of and I kind of alluded to it yesterday on the show that I didn't
[15:18.400 --> 15:25.000]  care for him or his antics and this is why in the late 80s and I'm gonna read
[15:25.000 --> 15:30.040]  you an article from Time Magazine and it's just it's a disgusting article in
[15:30.040 --> 15:33.720]  the late 80s he was caught running a underage male brothel out of his
[15:33.720 --> 15:39.560]  Washington DC home with his male prostitute boyfriend what's his name
[15:39.560 --> 15:46.880]  Gobi yeah I think it's something Gobi so Mr. Gobi was a drug addicted male
[15:46.880 --> 15:51.600]  prostitute and of course being paid for sex by Barney Frank but Frank was
[15:51.600 --> 15:55.200]  letting him run in a brothel there and a lot of these kids were not 18 let me
[15:55.200 --> 16:01.640]  repeat that these kids were not 18 and he got caught and he basically threatened
[16:01.640 --> 16:05.960]  other members of the house and other political elites in Washington on the
[16:05.960 --> 16:08.200]  floor and said hey if I go down you're going down with me I believe he was a
[16:08.200 --> 16:12.640]  Republican at the time of course he switched over to Democrat but he survived
[16:12.640 --> 16:16.840]  the scandal and this is why he survived the scandal because number one we are
[16:16.840 --> 16:24.080]  utterly retarded as a populace and articles like this one in time a skeleton
[16:24.080 --> 16:29.320]  in Barney's closet a skeleton in Barney's closet no how about a young boy in
[16:29.320 --> 16:35.080]  Barney's closet I mean honestly a skeleton this is a skeleton no it's a
[16:35.080 --> 16:38.600]  little more than a skeleton the issue isn't that he's a homosexual it's that
[16:38.600 --> 16:44.320]  oh my god you know it's unbelievable that you're having sex with underage kids
[16:44.320 --> 16:49.080]  it even goes into another Ohio Republican Donald Lukens who got convicted
[16:49.080 --> 16:53.040]  in May of that year of having sex with a 16 year old girl again having sex with
[16:53.040 --> 16:58.560]  kids and that's 16 these these guys are into sicker so anyway he gets caught
[16:58.560 --> 17:04.240]  Time magazine puts out a skeleton in Barney Frank's closet now later on when
[17:04.240 --> 17:08.720]  Tom Foley who is basically the head of the CPS for the government is going on
[17:08.720 --> 17:14.280]  MSNBC applauding Chris Hansen and his little his little debacles catching
[17:14.280 --> 17:20.280]  all these other pedophiles and he gets caught inappropriately communicating
[17:20.280 --> 17:25.360]  with a 16 year old boy page well God knows what else he's up to this is what
[17:25.360 --> 17:30.280]  representative Barney Frank has to say about it all right he number one he
[17:30.280 --> 17:34.280]  gets to comment but him and the political pundits don't ever comment that
[17:34.280 --> 17:42.560]  it's a young boy it's a it's a gay issue they're like let's see was it common
[17:42.560 --> 17:46.840]  knowledge in Washington that Foley was gay excuse me he's not gay he's a pedophile
[17:46.840 --> 17:52.760]  all right both sides of the aisle knew it was an open secret Foley would get
[17:52.760 --> 17:57.440]  people in Florida thinking that he was up north but that was not the case once
[17:57.440 --> 18:01.240]  a congressional Christmas party at the White House my ex-boyfriend Herb went up
[18:01.240 --> 18:05.520]  to Foley and was with a female date and said to him why don't you get a real
[18:05.520 --> 18:09.880]  date Foley didn't say anything it's funny how a lot of gay male politicians in
[18:09.880 --> 18:13.320]  Washington came with the male dates of these events during the Clinton years
[18:13.320 --> 18:19.440]  but then showed up with females under Bush come on give me a break it's it's
[18:19.440 --> 18:24.840]  see again it's it's a they make it into a gay issue now that was back in 2006 he
[18:24.840 --> 18:30.640]  made those comments it's not a gay issue it's a issue of the fact that your
[18:30.640 --> 18:35.440]  pedophiles and you should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and then
[18:35.440 --> 18:39.640]  people can't believe that they would be this evil well here's just a light
[18:39.640 --> 18:44.040]  evil story I pulled up out of the news you know there's plenty of cases of the
[18:44.040 --> 18:48.080]  serial killers you know having kids chained up in their basements or women
[18:48.080 --> 18:51.080]  chained up in their basements or there was that case at a Syracuse where this
[18:51.080 --> 18:55.000]  guy would keep them for years in this basement and rape them continuously and
[18:55.000 --> 18:59.040]  then eventually kill them and he had a family upstairs here's just a light one
[18:59.040 --> 19:04.000]  to prove you know how sick people can be man accused of selling daughter for cash
[19:04.000 --> 19:07.960]  and beer and this is out of the Associated Press okay it's out of
[19:07.960 --> 19:11.600]  California by the way police have arrested a Greenfield man for allegedly
[19:11.600 --> 19:16.000]  arranging to sell his 14-year-old daughter daughter in into marriage in
[19:16.000 --> 19:22.000]  exchange for 16 grand a hundred cases of beer and several cases of meat police
[19:22.000 --> 19:25.960]  said that they only learned the deal after the 36-year-old man went went to
[19:25.960 --> 19:30.320]  them to get his daughter back because payment wasn't made as promised so this

[24:46.360 --> 24:50.640]  Wall Street Journal article from the 90s how I love to learn them I'm sorry how I
[24:50.640 --> 24:54.840]  learned to love the new world order where he says that overpopulation is a
[24:54.840 --> 25:02.760]  problem they're saying world sustainable society which calls for global
[25:02.760 --> 25:06.120]  governance and says rich countries must shrink their economies to address
[25:06.120 --> 25:11.600]  climate change let me repeat that the sustainable world society which calls for
[25:11.600 --> 25:15.480]  global governance and says rich countries must shrink their economies to
[25:15.480 --> 25:19.800]  address climate change see this is his global warming czar we're back in the

[25:46.760 --> 25:50.640]  sustainable world society the organization's action arm on climate
[25:50.640 --> 25:54.040]  change see it's not global warming even though she's the global warming czar
[25:54.040 --> 25:57.960]  it's all about climate change that broadens it out a bit you know they're
[25:57.960 --> 26:02.680]  allowed to do a lot more with just climate change it's all okay it sounds
[26:02.680 --> 26:07.840]  better climate change yes says the developed world must reduce consumption
[26:07.840 --> 26:12.640]  and commit to binding and punitive limits on greenhouse gas emissions mr.

[26:46.600 --> 26:50.800]  society includes world leaders from a variety of political parties including
[26:50.800 --> 26:54.600]  british prime minister gordon brown okay i need you to pull up another clip
[26:54.600 --> 26:58.560]  let's pull up gordon brown talking about the new world just type in gordon
[26:58.560 --> 27:04.440]  brown new world order speech this is before he was elected and i'll let you
[27:04.440 --> 27:07.760]  know when you got the right one it's it's about two and a half minutes long he
[27:07.760 --> 27:12.520]  pumps in the term new world order about a dozen times and this guy is a toy i
[27:12.520 --> 27:17.400]  mean it's on the cover of the newspapers there for gordon brown calling for a
[27:17.400 --> 27:20.200]  new world order that's it right there that's it right there can we go right
[27:20.200 --> 27:23.720]  to that because that these are the people that are on the world's sustainable
[27:23.720 --> 27:30.280]  society that this lady is heavily involved in our play it up
[27:30.280 --> 27:35.200]  all these new challenges are bringing together about the biggest restructuring
[27:35.200 --> 27:39.760]  we have ever seen not just of the global economy but of the global order as a
[27:39.760 --> 27:44.640]  whole and two hundred years ago a famous british foreign secretary said that the
[27:44.640 --> 27:50.000]  new world had been called into existence to redress the balance of the old in
[27:50.000 --> 27:56.880]  1990 another old world ended dominated by the cold war and people talk then in
[27:56.880 --> 28:01.640]  1990 of a new world order what they actually meant then was a new political
[28:01.640 --> 28:06.680]  order and what was not foreseen then but is obvious now from everything that we
[28:06.680 --> 28:11.680]  see and do what we experience in every day of our life is the sheer scale and
[28:11.680 --> 28:15.720]  speed and scope of globalization and it's only now that we can begin to
[28:15.720 --> 28:20.920]  understand that the world order that globalization brings and what it's going
[28:20.920 --> 28:24.400]  to look like it's driven forward now not just by the balance of military
[28:24.400 --> 28:29.120]  strength the cold war times or ordinary political power it's being driven
[28:29.120 --> 28:34.400]  forward by a seismic shift in economic power that we see around us but what
[28:34.400 --> 28:38.640]  does the new world order mean for countries like ours who are looking to
[28:38.640 --> 28:43.160]  succeed I suggest that the countries that are going to succeed are those that
[28:43.160 --> 28:48.680]  combine flexibility free trade open markets with proper stewardship of the
[28:48.680 --> 28:54.960]  environment and investment in education infrastructure and innovation and the
[28:54.960 --> 28:58.960]  question for us is how we meet and master all these challenges to ensure
[28:58.960 --> 29:03.440]  that Britain enhances its competitiveness in the process and realize
[29:03.440 --> 29:09.960]  realizes what I believe is our destiny of success in this new world order so in
[29:09.960 --> 29:16.200]  conclusion ladies and gentlemen a new world is emerging it is a new world
[29:16.200 --> 29:22.520]  order with significantly different and radically new challenges for the future
[29:22.520 --> 29:29.560]  all right well obviously I've made the term new world order up and you know

[32:05.760 --> 32:10.240]  me to give them the date as to when they should be finished stocking up on food
[32:10.240 --> 32:13.760]  we've been so beaten up by stock market banking housing and unemployment
[32:13.760 --> 32:17.360]  crashes that were desensitized and frozen and active like the frog being
[32:17.360 --> 32:20.800]  unknowingly cooked in gradually increasingly hot water
[32:20.800 --> 32:23.280]  will snap out of it we now have a deadline
[32:23.280 --> 32:27.360]  joe biden said it's going to happen former secretary of state colin powell
[32:27.360 --> 32:32.320]  went on cbs meet the press and pointed to about january 22nd is the time a major
[32:32.320 --> 32:35.360]  international incident would force the new president to make
[32:35.360 --> 32:39.360]  unpopular decisions while i take the generalities word my best
[32:39.360 --> 32:43.360]  advice is to have your food in your possession prior to the inauguration

[33:17.840 --> 33:24.320]  carol browner named obama's global climate change
[33:24.320 --> 33:29.840]  czar global warming czar member of the world sustainable society calling for
[33:29.840 --> 33:35.120]  global governance with such uh players is gordon brown at the helm
[33:35.120 --> 33:39.040]  this is what the new world order is this is a total takeover our
[33:39.040 --> 33:45.120]  economic our foreign and domestic policies
[33:45.120 --> 33:48.720]  we know most people tell you it's a cookie term it doesn't exist except for
[33:48.720 --> 33:52.000]  when world leaders are talking about it
[33:52.000 --> 33:55.840]  and they have to air it i mean john king knows about he talks about it on
[33:55.840 --> 33:59.920]  colbert colbert is well aware of it too i mean he's made some secret society
[33:59.920 --> 34:04.320]  references now that are that are just off the chain
[34:04.320 --> 34:08.480]  so again we have obama today talking about the economic crisis i'm sure he's
[34:08.480 --> 34:11.520]  going to talk about how he's behind bernacky
[34:11.520 --> 34:15.040]  and uh they need to give even more money to the banks
[34:15.040 --> 34:18.640]  even more money to the banks it's just going to sink the economy further
[34:18.640 --> 34:25.280]  and faster and let's just hope let's hope and pray that uh
[34:25.280 --> 34:30.320]  this 21st or 22nd crisis that colon pal is talking about has already passed
[34:30.320 --> 34:34.160]  because he was on a while back i did get a couple text message in the emails
[34:34.160 --> 34:37.920]  that people felt that it was uh the economic crisis that he was talking
[34:37.920 --> 34:40.080]  about
[34:40.800 --> 34:44.160]  let's hope it's not a draft let's hope he's not planning on we know what
[34:44.160 --> 34:48.320]  biden's on that diplomatic mission to pakistan i i really hope and pray it's
[34:48.320 --> 34:51.680]  not a draft but you know speaking of the draft that's a good segue in this
[34:51.680 --> 34:54.320]  before we take your calls and we'll do that
[34:54.320 --> 34:57.360]  after these two clips
[34:57.920 --> 35:04.080]  in 2007 this guy was promoting on a msnvc this blankly fellow that
[35:04.080 --> 35:06.960]  we need to bring back a draft but it won't be through the bush
[35:06.960 --> 35:09.520]  administration so we're going to play that clip first because now he has a
[35:09.520 --> 35:13.200]  book out and remember ron manuel is talking about the same exact thing
[35:13.200 --> 35:16.560]  males 18 to 25 he also mentions in this
[35:16.560 --> 35:21.200]  that uh obesity and urban couch potatoes are hindering recruitment
[35:21.200 --> 35:24.880]  uh so who knows maybe this is also going to be a call to regulate what we can
[35:24.880 --> 35:27.520]  and can't eat all right let's play the Buchanan clip
[35:27.520 --> 35:31.440]  tuition of the military draft should be considered
[35:31.440 --> 35:34.400]  and has always been an option on the table
[35:34.400 --> 35:38.080]  the pentagon spokesman frontly rejected the idea today
[35:38.080 --> 35:41.200]  saying that the military is giving the idea quote
[35:41.200 --> 35:47.280]  absolutely no consideration unquote but is it time to revive conscription for
[35:47.280 --> 35:51.120]  the first time since richard nixon back to discuss it or democratic
[35:51.120 --> 35:53.840]  strategists stefanie cutter and editor of the
[35:53.840 --> 35:57.680]  washington times at a page editorial page tony blankly
[35:57.680 --> 36:02.560]  tony uh just see me political year nobody's going to recommend a return to
[36:02.560 --> 36:06.480]  the draft but is the draft a good idea or is a partial
[36:06.480 --> 36:10.320]  draft a good idea we got 5 000 troops in the army
[36:10.320 --> 36:13.440]  it is breaking according to the army chief of staff
[36:13.440 --> 36:17.280]  on the basis of two small guerrilla wars
[36:17.280 --> 36:20.880]  now is the u.s army big enough and strong enough
[36:20.880 --> 36:24.000]  to handle all the commitments this country's got it's not going to happen on
[36:24.000 --> 36:28.720]  bush's watch because it's not time for that debate to occur
[36:28.720 --> 36:33.360]  but the military clearly is not big enough to do the job that's going to be
[36:33.360 --> 36:37.600]  required of it in a world that we live in today and into the foreseeable
[36:37.600 --> 36:41.360]  future as you say two small wars and we're almost tapped out as far as
[36:41.360 --> 36:44.560]  troops are concerned you got a real split in the pentagon
[36:44.560 --> 36:47.680]  because they really believe in the volunteer force and i know a lot of
[36:47.680 --> 36:50.960]  people are in it and and the quality and the
[36:50.960 --> 36:54.640]  espritical that comes from being volunteers is a tremendous value in a
[36:54.640 --> 36:58.000]  high-tech army you want people who are committed to a career at least for many
[36:58.000 --> 37:01.840]  years not just drafties coming in so there's a huge argument for it
[37:01.840 --> 37:05.040]  for for keeping volunteer except you can't get to the numbers and i know
[37:05.040 --> 37:07.680]  there are some people that began i've talked with some who are talking about
[37:07.680 --> 37:11.760]  the day is going to come when as wonderful as our volunteer forces
[37:11.760 --> 37:15.200]  we're going to have to supplement it with it with a conscript army
[37:15.200 --> 37:18.880]  you agree with that i don't know whether or not the day is going to come
[37:18.880 --> 37:21.920]  i do agree that we take an enormous amount of political will
[37:21.920 --> 37:25.760]  to get this done and it'll take an enormous amount of time to build a
[37:25.760 --> 37:29.920]  political will but we are facing a crisis in terms of
[37:29.920 --> 37:35.280]  you know the kind of shit a thing can go but uh yeah right there in 2007 he
[37:35.280 --> 37:37.840]  blatantly says it's not going to happen under this administration well here
[37:37.840 --> 37:41.520]  comes the new administration and fox and friends to the rescue
[37:41.520 --> 37:44.320]  welcome back everyone seven minutes before the top of the hour can america's
[37:44.320 --> 37:47.680]  power last forever and how do we achieve a new nationalism
[37:47.680 --> 37:52.000]  that puts our country's survival first those questions and more are addressed
[37:52.000 --> 37:55.360]  in a brand new book by tony blankley comes out today it's called american
[37:55.360 --> 37:59.200]  grit what will it take for america to survive and win
[37:59.200 --> 38:02.880]  in the 21st century and join us for his first tv interview about the book is
[38:02.880 --> 38:06.560]  tony blankley tony good morning to you good morning thank you
[38:06.560 --> 38:10.160]  you know uh if you read some of the european papers they're talking about
[38:10.160 --> 38:14.560]  america is finally in decline they're getting what they've had come into them
[38:14.560 --> 38:18.960]  all along do you believe that well it could be so
[38:18.960 --> 38:23.040]  we have it in our power not to be in decline and that's what my book's about
[38:23.040 --> 38:25.840]  i do believe that for the first time in our history
[38:25.840 --> 38:30.240]  if we don't do a lot of things smart and tough we could get overwhelmed by the
[38:30.240 --> 38:33.520]  rise of china the rise of india the rise of radical islam
[38:33.520 --> 38:38.240]  we failed to exploit our energy uh while educate we're not paying enough
[38:38.240 --> 38:40.320]  attention to what our kids are learning bill
[38:40.320 --> 38:45.200]  airs is actually a senior person in guiding the curriculum design of america
[38:45.200 --> 38:50.320]  that started just this last march so i but we have it in our power and i try to
[38:50.320 --> 38:53.200]  write some tough proposals for what we need to do
[38:53.200 --> 38:56.480]  so that our grandchildren live in a country strong enough to protect our
[38:56.480 --> 38:59.120]  freedoms just as we do yeah tony your book's going to get a lot of
[38:59.120 --> 39:02.160]  attention because there are some controversial bold
[39:02.160 --> 39:06.000]  suggestions the first one obviously that caught my eye was that you're calling
[39:06.000 --> 39:09.360]  for a universal draft which would mean that all 18
[39:09.360 --> 39:13.600]  year olds in america would have to serve for two years
[39:13.600 --> 39:18.000]  yes look i don't like it i i love the volunteer army i've got a son who's a
[39:18.000 --> 39:22.720]  second lieutenant in the volunteer army i know the young men and women who serve
[39:22.720 --> 39:25.760]  they're the greatest young kids we we've ever produced
[39:25.760 --> 39:29.280]  but we don't have enough troops and it's manifest that we don't buy several
[39:29.280 --> 39:33.120]  magnitudes for instance when george bush
[39:33.120 --> 39:37.120]  wanted to have the surge he was told by the senior generals we didn't have the
[39:37.120 --> 39:42.160]  extra 20 000 troops to finish the war now he decided to go against their advice
[39:42.160 --> 39:45.440]  but the advice of the top generals as we didn't have the 20 000
[39:45.440 --> 39:49.200]  now obama wants to go into afghanistan may be a good thing but he said we don't
[39:49.200 --> 39:52.080]  have the troops that's we pull out of it right there cut it right there
[39:52.080 --> 39:55.760]  all right see obama does want to go into afghanistan just like i talked about
[39:55.760 --> 39:58.400]  yesterday he's going to be repositioning the troops there it's going to be a
[39:58.400 --> 40:02.800]  flux from iraq into there you still see troops in iraq of course but this guy
[40:02.800 --> 40:08.160]  has been calling for this oh my god we're going to draft 18-year-old kids and
[40:08.160 --> 40:11.520]  we're going to put them to war it's unbelievable it's coming back
[40:11.520 --> 40:14.560]  ron manuel's behind it all right let's take your calls i promise i take your
[40:14.560 --> 40:18.880]  calls take a couple calls before the break uh let's go to
[40:18.880 --> 40:21.760]  diane in new york diane what's on your mind

[40:42.960 --> 40:46.640]  some people in new york are familiar with aton edwards because he went
[40:46.640 --> 40:52.560]  on the radio shortly after 9-11 and and said that the air was not safe to
[40:52.560 --> 40:56.240]  breathe and he got married julie on a very very angry
[40:56.240 --> 41:00.720]  um and edwards he's going to discuss in a way of preparedness what to do when

[42:02.880 --> 42:06.880]  all right let's go to uh tom in utah tom what's on your mind
[42:06.880 --> 42:10.320]  howdy uh the first thing i want to do is plead with all of my
[42:10.320 --> 42:14.560]  anybody out there that has contact with eustis mollans
[42:14.560 --> 42:21.840]  is that a familiar name to you i'm at eustis yes um i opened up an issue uh
[42:21.840 --> 42:26.320]  and it may sound so trivial or unconnected but it falls in with what
[42:26.320 --> 42:29.600]  you're talking about it's about you know affecting the
[42:29.600 --> 42:35.360]  military also affecting what i hate to even say this it sounds
[42:35.360 --> 42:43.040]  like almost a eugenics program um anyway anybody can
[42:43.040 --> 42:47.120]  contact eustis or if you can get him to contact me and
[42:47.120 --> 42:53.200]  go to a website called gassing america dot com again that's gassing america
[42:53.200 --> 42:59.840]  dot com and i said that's kind of a curious issue with the military
[42:59.840 --> 43:03.760]  the military is using units that were
[43:03.760 --> 43:07.600]  designed or put the change of design occurred
[43:07.600 --> 43:12.720]  after what i what i perceive as a curious meeting at iron mountain
[43:12.720 --> 43:17.120]  i don't know that ring though and you know what tom you're all over the place
[43:17.120 --> 43:19.040]  here i mean i look thank you for the call
[43:19.040 --> 43:22.640]  iron mountain is a uh military base underground in pennsylvania
[43:22.640 --> 43:25.440]  god knows what they do there we know they store a lot of things there
[43:25.440 --> 43:30.000]  um if you're talking about i don't know the depleted uranium and iraq you know
[43:30.000 --> 43:33.120]  poisoning soldiers we know that's there uh if you're talking about the chem
[43:33.120 --> 43:36.240]  trail situation you know i'm gonna talk about chem trails
[43:36.240 --> 43:40.800]  uh when we do the tv because i want to show the new metallica video all
[43:40.800 --> 43:44.800]  nightmare long uh it's got the tengus gov and it it's
[43:44.800 --> 43:47.680]  got eugenics in it it turns into something out of
[43:47.680 --> 43:50.800]  doom but then it goes into chem trails and i really think it's worth
[43:50.800 --> 43:53.600]  uh people watching because at the end they try to spin it
[43:53.600 --> 43:57.600]  that chem trails are there to protect us and i'm not a big fan of that
[43:57.600 --> 44:01.520]  even though i'm a big fan of metallica all right let's go to the next caller
[44:01.520 --> 44:05.440]  let's go to randy and michigan randy what's on your mind
[44:05.440 --> 44:09.920]  hey jason um yeah i call in often um when you you're hosting as well as a
[44:09.920 --> 44:13.120]  lex jones um i was just gonna comment on the draft thing
[44:13.120 --> 44:16.800]  and like it's it's so true you guys have been warning about it
[44:16.800 --> 44:20.480]  so long and like ron paul's warned about it and you know i read his book the
[44:20.480 --> 44:23.520]  revolution and i'll quote something out of his book is that okay if i do that
[44:23.520 --> 44:26.320]  let's do please do okay it's out of the revolution he
[44:26.320 --> 44:29.520]  says the draft is a totalitarian institution that is based on the idea
[44:29.520 --> 44:32.640]  that the government owns you and can dispose of your life as it wishes
[44:32.640 --> 44:35.680]  and then he goes on about robert taff how he talked about it and
[44:35.680 --> 44:39.440]  and jason how you were commenting on the obesity statement from those military
[44:39.440 --> 44:43.200]  guys or whatever it just reminds me of how you and alex warned of this in the
[44:43.200 --> 44:45.680]  past it how like how the government offers a proper
[44:45.680 --> 44:49.280]  create the problem then offers a solution it's like narrow-minded solution
[44:49.280 --> 44:52.560]  and forcible you know and the corporations
[44:52.560 --> 44:55.280]  they've been putting high fructose corn syrup in our food tier and just to
[44:55.280 --> 44:58.160]  say you know half cents on bottle of coke or whatever and
[44:58.160 --> 45:01.600]  it's just making us fat and then oh hey you guys are fat get the military
[45:01.600 --> 45:04.480]  here i don't know what it'll do is they'll
[45:04.480 --> 45:07.280]  that'll be part of your little carbon credit system i thank for the call
[45:07.280 --> 45:10.240]  randy and we always like ron paul quotes here by the way
[45:10.240 --> 45:14.640]  um it'll go like this oh you're obese you're gonna have to pay a little more
[45:14.640 --> 45:17.840]  tax action otherwise we're gonna have to take your food from you and basically
[45:17.840 --> 45:22.000]  codex elementarius is gonna decide what kind of foods you you can have what
[45:22.000 --> 45:25.440]  you can ingest and we're gonna talk about that later actually a couple of
[45:25.440 --> 45:28.880]  our guests today are talking about how they're swat teaming and raiding
[45:28.880 --> 45:32.000]  menonites we're trying to sell eggs at local farmers markets we're gonna have
[45:32.000 --> 45:37.520]  jonah stulfitz and uh morris thompson on from two to three in the final hour
[45:37.520 --> 45:42.080]  and uh here's the deal when people try to regulate your food what's gonna happen
[45:42.080 --> 45:45.360]  is the general populace is going to get very sick a lot of us aren't gonna have
[45:45.360 --> 45:48.560]  the vitamins and minerals we need we're gonna be turning to a slave class and
[45:48.560 --> 45:51.840]  then with this uh conscription we're gonna be the healthiest we've ever been
[45:51.840 --> 45:55.680]  from 18 to 25 while we're in the military because they're gonna juice us up
[45:55.680 --> 46:01.040]  with all sorts of uh god knows what and for a for a certain amount of time will
[46:01.040 --> 46:04.080]  appear very healthy but uh they'll probably have long-term detrimental
[46:04.080 --> 46:07.600]  effects like most of their vaccinations and programs do
[46:07.600 --> 46:11.520]  all right let's go to the next caller let's go to scott in seattle scott
[46:11.520 --> 46:15.440]  what's on your mind yes hello thank you for taking my
[46:15.440 --> 46:19.120]  call first-time caller and i'm kind of glad that you brought up the draft
[46:19.120 --> 46:22.240]  because there's two things about it that i want to mention
[46:22.240 --> 46:26.240]  um i had kind of had brought this up on my little internet show
[46:26.240 --> 46:30.080]  several months ago when people were denying that he was trying to push it
[46:30.080 --> 46:35.280]  but isn't it just very funny how these so-called two-faced funny ass progressive
[46:35.280 --> 46:39.040]  talk show hosts and bloggers are sitting up here
[46:39.040 --> 46:43.040]  trying to push this national service act is some kind of a
[46:43.040 --> 46:48.560]  fdr type thing but you know when uh if john mccain were to bring it up you
[46:48.560 --> 46:52.720]  know oh they were hyperventilating about it but you know obama is supposed to be
[46:52.720 --> 46:55.760]  a good thing and you know they have not even read
[46:55.760 --> 46:58.080]  the thing and they don't even understand what this whole thing is
[46:58.080 --> 47:03.520]  about well obama's uh acceptance speech when he uh when he won the election he
[47:03.520 --> 47:07.120]  said that he was going to ask anybody for great service and sacrifice every
[47:07.120 --> 47:10.560]  single one of you guys well yeah right and they think it's
[47:10.560 --> 47:14.080]  you know some kind of john kennedy type thing talking about you know i have
[47:14.080 --> 47:17.840]  not what you know you can do for your company country blah blah blah
[47:17.840 --> 47:21.440]  but the second thing that i wanted to bring up about it real quick and i know
[47:21.440 --> 47:25.680]  you guys are in the information business and i know it was posted on your blog
[47:25.680 --> 47:30.400]  about the um national service act i don't think anybody is aware of this
[47:30.400 --> 47:33.920]  you know carol and kennedy who they're trying to get to replace
[47:33.920 --> 47:39.760]  um on hillary's senate seat um i don't think anybody is aware of this but she
[47:39.760 --> 47:43.440]  sits on the committee for the national service act
[47:43.440 --> 47:47.200]  wow well i mean it's not a shocker a lot of these people aren't there you know
[47:47.200 --> 47:50.800]  their fathers their uncles and uh they they do go along with the
[47:50.800 --> 47:54.640]  elitist and once you join politics it's so hard to go against that route
[47:54.640 --> 47:59.040]  and um often those who do or in playing crashes like her brother
[47:59.040 --> 48:03.280]  and i'm sorry not her brother but her cousin and uh not only him but look at
[48:03.280 --> 48:06.560]  uh paul wellstone also in a playing crash hey i don't know if these
[48:06.560 --> 48:10.160]  you know or any kind of conspiracies but it is kind of funny how they just end
[48:10.160 --> 48:12.880]  up dying whenever they oppose the establishment i thank you for the call
[48:12.880 --> 48:15.040]  scott we're going to go to another first time caller
[48:15.040 --> 48:18.960]  let's go to bob in vegas bob what's on your mind
[48:18.960 --> 48:22.800]  hi jason how you doing good man thanks for taking my call
[48:22.800 --> 48:27.440]  you got it i've always wanted to ask this question about gmo's whenever osama
[48:27.440 --> 48:31.920]  uh left from chicago he got a hamburger and fries before he left and when he
[48:31.920 --> 48:34.320]  got to washington he went up for a hot dog
[48:34.320 --> 48:38.000]  what do what do these elites eat do they know that they're eating gmo's just
[48:38.000 --> 48:40.560]  like us or do they ever go out to restaurants and eat because they're
[48:40.560 --> 48:44.480]  eating gmo's there too aren't they you know a lot of them do you know
[48:44.480 --> 48:47.840]  pump down diet coke and uh i mean you can see it on the bill
[48:47.840 --> 48:50.480]  berg tapes a lot of them don't eat healthy but
[48:50.480 --> 48:53.680]  the probable differences when you're a Rockefeller
[48:53.680 --> 48:57.040]  i'm guessing that they give you some kind of vaccination that's not tainted
[48:57.040 --> 48:59.920]  or they give you the vitamin sources i mean there's plenty of people out there
[48:59.920 --> 49:03.280]  with natural cures for cancer i'm not saying they all work a lot of them are
[49:03.280 --> 49:06.720]  scams but uh you know a lot of these things are health issues
[49:06.720 --> 49:10.000]  so you know they they probably have the top nutritionists in the world
[49:10.000 --> 49:13.920]  you know keeping their bodies healthy i mean they do seem to live an awful long
[49:13.920 --> 49:17.280]  time i mean daddy bush was just on tv with his son the other day
[49:17.280 --> 49:21.680]  and he's well into his eighties um you know what i'm saying these things are
[49:21.680 --> 49:25.200]  reversible i mean why why would they pump us full of gmo
[49:25.200 --> 49:27.760]  foods is because when the common guy gets cancer
[49:27.760 --> 49:31.200]  uh your insurance that you've paid into takes care of your death by
[49:31.200 --> 49:34.320]  letting you go get radiated for a few months and then dying
[49:34.320 --> 49:37.600]  you know i mean that that's i mean it's a huge industry i would
[49:37.600 --> 49:41.040]  i would encourage you to go check out uh g edward griffin's lecture a world
[49:41.040 --> 49:43.840]  without cancer and he really talks about b-17
[49:43.840 --> 49:48.160]  and levita fall and that treatment for cancer uh i believe there's a doctor
[49:48.160 --> 49:52.240]  named gersh out there that uh it must have been in the
[49:52.240 --> 49:55.440]  is either the fifties or sixties but he went before congress and had all these
[49:55.440 --> 49:59.200]  cases that he had cured and they basically threw him out and outlawed
[49:59.200 --> 50:02.560]  i mean they make it so you can't make any type of claim
[50:02.560 --> 50:06.960]  yesterday on the show for instance i played a clip of john kansas who
[50:06.960 --> 50:10.480]  cured his own cancer using radio frequency waves and then figured out a
[50:10.480 --> 50:14.480]  different frequency wave to burn saltwater now you can type in salt
[50:14.480 --> 50:17.520]  water burns watching on youtube we played the clip on the show
[50:17.520 --> 50:22.000]  yesterday well jason where do they get the groceries from do you think
[50:22.000 --> 50:25.360]  where do i would i would imagine from uh small farms that they're trying to
[50:25.360 --> 50:28.480]  outlaw okay well thanks for taking my call
[50:28.480 --> 50:32.320]  you got it um you know most of them do eat the uh the

[50:36.000 --> 50:39.040]  they want to stuff their faces just like everybody else the
[50:39.040 --> 50:41.360]  differences they know how to treat themselves because they have the top

[54:22.480 --> 54:25.360]  somewhat on topic i'm glad a couple people called in about the draft because
[54:25.360 --> 54:28.960]  you know we have talked about conscription on this program now for
[54:28.960 --> 54:31.040]  years you know a lot of people thought it would be under the bush
[54:31.040 --> 54:34.240]  administration but you know quite frankly so many of their
[54:34.240 --> 54:38.400]  lives were so thinly veiled and exposed on some level
[54:38.400 --> 54:42.240]  that it was hard for the people to get behind him in anything less than the
[54:42.240 --> 54:45.520]  september 11th event and that's just the facts
[54:45.520 --> 54:51.040]  and now they've manufactured this new state senator from 2004 to regular
[54:51.040 --> 54:56.960]  senator by 2006 to president in 2008 i mean you know
[54:56.960 --> 55:01.440]  i mean a state senator running for senator in 2004 getting the senate seat
[55:01.440 --> 55:05.600]  and now he's our president and they promote him as some kind of civil
[55:05.600 --> 55:09.040]  rights hero he hasn't done anything for civil rights
[55:09.040 --> 55:12.560]  you know other than putting a puppet man cherry and candidate black guy in
[55:12.560 --> 55:15.600]  there i would have much rather had synthia mckinney
[55:15.600 --> 55:20.400]  an african-american woman who stood for something actual civil rights
[55:20.400 --> 55:24.640]  pretty crazy huh and now you know with him naming his uh
[55:24.640 --> 55:28.240]  his climate czar carol m browner
[55:28.240 --> 55:34.640]  of the sustainable world society sustainable world society so again
[55:34.640 --> 55:39.120]  it's all about regulation of what you can eat breathe
[55:39.120 --> 55:43.040]  drive how much garbage you can have oh carbon footprint
[55:43.040 --> 55:46.240]  how i wish you didn't exist well you really don't exist it's a nonsense
[55:46.240 --> 55:49.760]  term to enslave you all right let's let's keep taking calls in the next

[56:06.640 --> 56:09.920]  david in california david what's on your mind
[56:09.920 --> 56:14.080]  hey jason how are you i got a comment on the draft man but uh
[56:14.080 --> 56:17.520]  can i finish up my thought from yesterday i i i got cut off because i was
[56:17.520 --> 56:20.640]  busy uh talking about obama and his uh all right sure
[56:20.640 --> 56:25.600]  being a side okay i was talking about how the rulers put great stock in their
[56:25.600 --> 56:29.200]  symbols of fake power and fake honor and all that
[56:29.200 --> 56:33.440]  and how ridiculous it is and how we can hurt them with it without violence
[56:33.440 --> 56:38.560]  and legally as well because it feels good uh here's an example for you
[56:38.560 --> 56:42.320]  congratulations to our honorable united states navy
[56:42.320 --> 56:45.600]  on the commissioning of their new aircraft carrier
[56:45.600 --> 56:53.680]  the uss george pervert walker bush named after a child molesting homosexual
[56:53.680 --> 56:58.320]  criminal boy i want my kid to serve on that ship
[56:58.320 --> 57:02.320]  i'm referring to the washington times front page story during the reagan
[57:02.320 --> 57:06.160]  bush administration quote underage male prostitute
[57:06.160 --> 57:09.360]  tourist white house after midnight that's a quote
[57:09.360 --> 57:12.320]  anyone who's unaware of this can simply search for
[57:12.320 --> 57:16.480]  franklin cover-up and conspiracy of silence i'm glad you brought that up
[57:16.480 --> 57:18.480]  because we talked about that earlier today that's
[57:18.480 --> 57:21.840]  kind of a nexus point into the barney frank stuff that i was talking about
[57:21.840 --> 57:26.160]  earlier where he was caught running an underage male brothel out of his dc
[57:26.160 --> 57:28.480]  home as well and i would encourage people to watch
[57:28.480 --> 57:31.520]  i mean uh you know franklin cover-ups got a lot more information
[57:31.520 --> 57:35.360]  i've read the franklin cover-up as well but uh conspiracy of silence is one of
[57:35.360 --> 57:38.640]  those youtube videos out there that really it'll
[57:38.640 --> 57:42.160]  absolutely make you vomit in your mouth if you sit through the whole hour and
[57:42.160 --> 57:45.440]  this was something that was supposed to air on it was either the discovery
[57:45.440 --> 57:48.880]  channel or any i think it was the discovery channel it was actually
[57:48.880 --> 57:53.520]  listed in a local and the national tv guides
[57:53.520 --> 57:57.520]  and it was lobbied not to be put on television they paid all the expense i
[57:57.520 --> 58:00.240]  think it was something over two hundred and fifty thousand dollars back to the
[58:00.240 --> 58:04.480]  producers congress paid for it and uh even more disturbing
[58:04.480 --> 58:07.600]  is the fact that the only reason it's out there is because somebody who worked
[58:07.600 --> 58:11.440]  on the case had a working work print copy or someone in the editing had a
[58:11.440 --> 58:16.480]  work print copy and he gave it to john de camp so we could
[58:16.480 --> 58:20.080]  present it in one of the boys cases dave will come back to you on the other side
[58:20.080 --> 58:24.240]  five after the hour we have mitis resources and ted anderson on it's the

[1:00:44.400 --> 1:00:47.520]  get it right right now we're on the line with david who's making a point of a
[1:00:47.520 --> 1:00:51.280]  nonviolent way for us to have an effect and it's really to go after their
[1:00:51.280 --> 1:00:56.000]  their symbols their you know ships named after them their monuments i know the
[1:00:56.000 --> 1:01:00.080]  georgia guide stones had something happened to them a couple weeks ago
[1:01:00.080 --> 1:01:05.280]  go ahead david okay well basically yeah it's a way to attack them directly and
[1:01:05.280 --> 1:01:09.120]  i think really we've been polite too long now i mean we we keep asking them
[1:01:09.120 --> 1:01:12.160]  questions and stuff and hey i don't take anything away from the brave people to
[1:01:12.160 --> 1:01:15.200]  get up in these people's face and ask them questions but it's hard to get out
[1:01:15.200 --> 1:01:19.120]  of a complete sentence or a good question and and you know and you know you're
[1:01:19.120 --> 1:01:21.680]  not going to get an answer because they have no answer
[1:01:21.680 --> 1:01:24.720]  you know i mean it's nice to get into stammer on video or sometimes make an
[1:01:24.720 --> 1:01:27.360]  admission i find you get more uh... flies with honey
[1:01:27.360 --> 1:01:30.720]  so you kind of make it like uh... you know you're taking their position the
[1:01:30.720 --> 1:01:33.680]  way you preface the question will open up a little more than then you can go
[1:01:33.680 --> 1:01:37.760]  after the hardcore stuff right since i haven't done it i can't say that if i
[1:01:37.760 --> 1:01:40.560]  get a chance at somebody like dick cheney i'm gonna holler i'm just gonna
[1:01:40.560 --> 1:01:42.960]  start holler and you're a nine eleven criminal you know
[1:01:42.960 --> 1:01:46.400]  arrest that man right now what do you have to say about these draft clips
[1:01:46.400 --> 1:01:47.040]  day
[1:01:47.040 --> 1:01:50.240]  okay well uh... regarding the draft i just wanted to point out that wasn't a
[1:01:50.240 --> 1:01:54.160]  charlie dingle that first brought up the the uh... conscription
[1:01:54.160 --> 1:01:57.120]  uh... back during the beginning of the bush era saying that that would make it
[1:01:57.120 --> 1:01:59.360]  more fair if everybody had to join
[1:01:59.360 --> 1:02:02.880]  oh you know it this has been around now since they've taken away so i mean
[1:02:02.880 --> 1:02:06.880]  i'm trying to think who was who it was even during uh... you know the bush
[1:02:06.880 --> 1:02:10.640]  administration in the military saying it was uh... unnecessary i think that
[1:02:10.640 --> 1:02:14.400]  you can mention it's an ongoing thing they've wanted this for a long time
[1:02:14.400 --> 1:02:18.000]  you know every every proponent of israel is always like we should have it just
[1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:21.440]  like the israelis do mandatory conscription for everybody
[1:02:21.440 --> 1:02:25.040]  obviously a great job yeah oh yeah they do such a great job with their black
[1:02:25.040 --> 1:02:26.800]  ops david i thank you for the call

[1:02:42.880 --> 1:02:46.160]  things just a couple small things uh... one of the things is uh...
[1:02:46.160 --> 1:02:50.400]  i live in haggartown maryland uh... which is very close to antinom battlefield
[1:02:50.400 --> 1:02:53.120]  the reason i asked that or reason i say that is because
[1:02:53.120 --> 1:02:56.880]  um i've been watching this show for a while i'm the first time caller
[1:02:56.880 --> 1:03:00.640]  and uh... was up there uh... looking around at burnside bridge you know a
[1:03:00.640 --> 1:03:03.360]  famous bridge in the war you know the antinom battlefield
[1:03:03.360 --> 1:03:06.160]  that's about a famous battle and antinom
[1:03:06.160 --> 1:03:10.240]  um and and on the the subscription you know i looked up at the time i didn't
[1:03:10.240 --> 1:03:13.040]  even catch it and i was reading through the history and i thought
[1:03:13.040 --> 1:03:16.080]  well you know this is just basic history you know you know blah blah blah but i
[1:03:16.080 --> 1:03:19.360]  heard before right when i was a kid uh... but when i looked at the top i
[1:03:19.360 --> 1:03:22.960]  looked at the title of who was here and i thought you'd see you know the
[1:03:22.960 --> 1:03:26.000]  confederate confederates you know all this other stuff
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:29.520]  you know the south and all this and i see this thing called the federalist
[1:03:29.520 --> 1:03:32.640]  and i thought i can't believe what i just saw you know i thought
[1:03:32.640 --> 1:03:36.560]  the federalist didn't hit me till like just a couple weeks ago the federal list
[1:03:36.560 --> 1:03:40.480]  and i thought fbi the federal bureau of investigation
[1:03:40.480 --> 1:03:44.000]  i thought the federal reserve you know i thought wow it's incredible
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:47.760]  and also something else i want to ask um well actually i wanted to tell you about
[1:03:47.760 --> 1:03:51.680]  this all because uh i've seen it on tv so many times it makes me just makes me
[1:03:51.680 --> 1:03:55.360]  mad i just want to like throw like somebody has tv
[1:03:55.360 --> 1:04:00.560]  you know i know that happens often now it's the medicine thing i mean
[1:04:00.560 --> 1:04:03.840]  we got all these different medicines they're advertising on tv i mean are
[1:04:03.840 --> 1:04:07.840]  they advertising it to us directly or because we can't get it without a
[1:04:07.840 --> 1:04:11.680]  prescription you know i don't give you a prescription for all that stuff are you

[1:08:33.520 --> 1:08:37.600]  program possible the head of gcn and uh gold is up today isn't it
[1:08:37.600 --> 1:08:42.000]  yeah yeah took a nice little rise after yesterday's drop which is good to see i
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:45.280]  mean i you know you when you watch the gold prices
[1:08:45.280 --> 1:08:50.320]  falling yesterday you just knew that the uh that the financial
[1:08:50.320 --> 1:08:54.400]  manipulators the uh you know the the the central banks of the
[1:08:54.400 --> 1:08:57.760]  world were trying to convince people that they should stay into paper and get
[1:08:57.760 --> 1:09:00.960]  away from gold i mean that's that's what they've been doing here i mean even
[1:09:00.960 --> 1:09:04.560]  going back when gold was pegged at four hundred dollars an ounce
[1:09:04.560 --> 1:09:08.400]  every time gold would start to increase over four hundred
[1:09:08.400 --> 1:09:11.680]  uh they would lower the lease rates and sort of
[1:09:11.680 --> 1:09:15.120]  push the mining companies into the position where they'd sell short their
[1:09:15.120 --> 1:09:18.720]  position in the ground to push more gold into the marketplace
[1:09:18.720 --> 1:09:22.880]  before it's even uh produced and dropping the prices i mean that's part
[1:09:22.880 --> 1:09:25.760]  of the way that they manipulate things in the futures market
[1:09:25.760 --> 1:09:29.200]  and uh the reason why they do those things is because they want to hide and
[1:09:29.200 --> 1:09:32.400]  mask all the problems financially that are going on in the world
[1:09:32.400 --> 1:09:36.960]  and keep people from fleeing to hard assets and staying in their paper
[1:09:36.960 --> 1:09:39.600]  currencies for which they get to produce for nothing
[1:09:39.600 --> 1:09:43.360]  yeah you know i was a avid listener you know not so long ago i think you know
[1:09:43.360 --> 1:09:46.880]  six years ago in 2003 when it was under four hundred dollars an ounce
[1:09:46.880 --> 1:09:51.600]  and for something to more than double in value in that short a period of time
[1:09:51.600 --> 1:09:55.360]  and really it does protect you from the fiat currency the fact that
[1:09:55.360 --> 1:09:58.720]  we've got vernacchi today saying that we of course we need more about bailouts
[1:09:58.720 --> 1:10:02.080]  for more banks and obama's supposed to address the nation
[1:10:02.080 --> 1:10:04.720]  uh with his economic plan and he'll probably say yeah we're going to give
[1:10:04.720 --> 1:10:06.560]  bailouts to everybody it's going to be great
[1:10:06.560 --> 1:10:10.560]  well you know obama i mean that's that that's the the fight right now obama's
[1:10:10.560 --> 1:10:13.520]  saying hey let's give the money to the people directly
[1:10:13.520 --> 1:10:17.760]  and uh... and uh... and uh... the vernacchi's
[1:10:17.760 --> 1:10:22.000]  along with uh... along with uh... what's his name i can't even remember but
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:25.440]  it is brunettes yeah well not paulson it's that it's that
[1:10:25.440 --> 1:10:28.960]  the chairman the democratic senator of anyway i can't remember but anyway
[1:10:28.960 --> 1:10:32.160]  anyways they're they're they're talking about giving the money the banks
[1:10:32.160 --> 1:10:35.760]  uh... you know thank god at least at least
[1:10:35.760 --> 1:10:39.840]  obama is talking about uh... is talking about having more
[1:10:39.840 --> 1:10:43.600]  uh... accountability i mean we gave away three hundred fifty thousand three
[1:10:43.600 --> 1:10:46.720]  hundred fifty uh... billion dollars and we don't even know
[1:10:46.720 --> 1:10:50.560]  where the money went to i mean you can kind of follow the tracks and guess
[1:10:50.560 --> 1:10:53.760]  because the banks that we gave it to were a busy buying up all the banks that
[1:10:53.760 --> 1:10:57.520]  they competed with so they could build even bigger monopolies and have
[1:10:57.520 --> 1:11:01.040]  uh... even more risk of failing if they're if they're these big
[1:11:01.040 --> 1:11:04.640]  institutions so they can get even more money when they come in i mean it's
[1:11:04.640 --> 1:11:08.320]  it's such a crazy game and none of the money made it into the economy
[1:11:08.320 --> 1:11:11.280]  to stimulate the whatever it was for
[1:11:11.280 --> 1:11:14.240]  because there's more unemployment now than there was when it started
[1:11:14.240 --> 1:11:17.840]  there's more companies failing there's more bankruptcies i mean the economy
[1:11:17.840 --> 1:11:20.560]  is slid backwards it hasn't helped a bit
[1:11:20.560 --> 1:11:24.000]  and now they're talking about you know let's give more money to the banks i mean
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:26.960]  of course bernanke's gonna say that because that's his buddies i mean the
[1:11:26.960 --> 1:11:29.200]  people that own the federal reserve system
[1:11:29.200 --> 1:11:33.760]  are the uh... are the member banks it's the chase manhattan the city corp the
[1:11:33.760 --> 1:11:38.800]  the wells fargo bank i mean the if there's anything that that just
[1:11:38.800 --> 1:11:42.160]  boils my blood more than anything and it's a very fact
[1:11:42.160 --> 1:11:46.560]  that the united states people labor i mean we are the ones that create the
[1:11:46.560 --> 1:11:51.760]  the money that we use for commerce the money is made out of cotton everybody
[1:11:51.760 --> 1:11:54.160]  says it's made out of paper paper means paper
[1:11:54.160 --> 1:11:58.240]  it means wood pulp to me but if you go to washington dc
[1:11:58.240 --> 1:12:01.200]  they're gonna tell you exactly what it's made out of most of the fibers in there
[1:12:01.200 --> 1:12:05.280]  made from cotton and that money is manufactured and printed
[1:12:05.280 --> 1:12:09.360]  by the u.s treasury which is financed by the taxpayers
[1:12:09.360 --> 1:12:12.880]  and that money is then turned over to the federal reserve system it has no
[1:12:12.880 --> 1:12:15.840]  value until they put their one little ink stamp on it
[1:12:15.840 --> 1:12:19.200]  and then what do they do to get it in the economy so we can use it as commerce
[1:12:19.200 --> 1:12:23.040]  they lend it to us so they're getting it for free and they lend it to us
[1:12:23.040 --> 1:12:26.640]  and they lend it to us at the current interest rate whatever it is you know if
[1:12:26.640 --> 1:12:31.040]  the 30-year treasury is at five percent they're getting five percent for doing
[1:12:31.040 --> 1:12:34.240]  nothing and and it just you know and then you
[1:12:34.240 --> 1:12:37.520]  now we're now we're bailing out all the all the banks
[1:12:37.520 --> 1:12:41.280]  that are in this game that are getting this something for nothing
[1:12:41.280 --> 1:12:44.800]  and we're giving them even more tax dollars just because they they went in
[1:12:44.800 --> 1:12:48.320]  and they made some investments some malinvestments in in second rate
[1:12:48.320 --> 1:12:52.800]  mortgages which are now being defaulted on you know the whole game is crazy i i
[1:12:52.800 --> 1:12:56.640]  can tell you right now jason if there's anything that i can do
[1:12:56.640 --> 1:13:00.320]  for the united states of america is to just win
[1:13:00.320 --> 1:13:04.960]  the minds of people can actually think logically of what's really going on here
[1:13:04.960 --> 1:13:08.800]  because every you know that half of the public are more than half of the public
[1:13:08.800 --> 1:13:11.760]  just don't know they don't know what it means
[1:13:11.760 --> 1:13:14.640]  when there's an economic stimulus package or a bailout
[1:13:14.640 --> 1:13:18.400]  we're just selling out we we labor we work
[1:13:18.400 --> 1:13:23.680]  45 percent of our year just to pay taxes most of those taxes for which go to the
[1:13:23.680 --> 1:13:27.200]  interest on the debt which is funneled right back to this
[1:13:27.200 --> 1:13:29.920]  banking system that gets this money for nothing
[1:13:29.920 --> 1:13:33.440]  so we're just laboring our lives away so they can
[1:13:33.440 --> 1:13:37.120]  they can live bigger and fatter it's it's like it's like this
[1:13:37.120 --> 1:13:40.320]  there's this fulcrum in the middle it's like a teeter totter we have the
[1:13:40.320 --> 1:13:44.480]  taxpayers on one end carrying the burden of this huge debt
[1:13:44.480 --> 1:13:48.960]  and as the debt continues to grow it becomes tougher and tougher for the
[1:13:48.960 --> 1:13:52.160]  people that work in this country to service that debt
[1:13:52.160 --> 1:13:55.520]  and at the same time on the other side of that teeter totter
[1:13:55.520 --> 1:13:59.600]  as the debt continues to grow and we get further on the hook
[1:13:59.600 --> 1:14:05.200]  this money institution this this machine becomes more profitable because they
[1:14:05.200 --> 1:14:09.040]  get to have more of our labor or more of the fruits of our labor
[1:14:09.040 --> 1:14:13.760]  and it's just it's a it's a crazy process it certainly isn't constitutional
[1:14:13.760 --> 1:14:17.280]  wasn't intended by our forefathers to have it this way
[1:14:17.280 --> 1:14:22.160]  and yet this is what we have and the only way we can stop this from happening
[1:14:22.160 --> 1:14:25.760]  is to get the people involved and educate them
[1:14:25.760 --> 1:14:29.920]  and and teach them that this is the process and until you stop the process
[1:14:29.920 --> 1:14:33.520]  this financial machine will work against us every corner we turn
[1:14:33.520 --> 1:14:36.320]  and they're going to buttercoat it to make it look like they're helping us
[1:14:36.320 --> 1:14:41.360]  that's the sad that's the whole sickness you know when when when Bernanke's in
[1:14:41.360 --> 1:14:44.800]  there saying hey we need to bail out these banks we need to give more power
[1:14:44.800 --> 1:14:48.080]  we need to turn over our money without accountability
[1:14:48.080 --> 1:14:52.800]  i mean it is you know it it what it is just selling the people further down
[1:14:52.800 --> 1:14:54.960]  the road and and the people are thinking oh great the
[1:14:54.960 --> 1:14:58.560]  government's going to bail us out we'll have all these checks as the economy
[1:14:58.560 --> 1:15:01.680]  is going to do better because the government's helping us the more the
[1:15:01.680 --> 1:15:04.160]  government helps us the more they're hurting us and it's
[1:15:04.160 --> 1:15:08.400]  you know and and and and for some reason the people don't understand
[1:15:08.400 --> 1:15:12.400]  that this is how the system works and and we're just getting further into the
[1:15:12.400 --> 1:15:15.520]  further and you know going further down the drain is what we're doing
[1:15:15.520 --> 1:15:17.840]  well it's by design they don't know what's going on i mean you can have
[1:15:17.840 --> 1:15:21.520]  Dennis Kasinich on the the floor house actually say that federal reserve is
[1:15:21.520 --> 1:15:24.960]  as federal as federal express and none of the mainstream media will cover
[1:15:24.960 --> 1:15:28.800]  that but it is a talking point that now we are in the worst economic state since
[1:15:28.800 --> 1:15:31.760]  the great depression why don't you help people protect themselves and give out
[1:15:31.760 --> 1:15:35.600]  the website for mitis resources well i'll tell you the first thing that i'm
[1:15:35.600 --> 1:15:39.200]  doing what i my my next campaign is this i mean we've done an awful lot with
[1:15:39.200 --> 1:15:43.520]  genesis and i'm really pleased to have the people supporting us like they do
[1:15:43.520 --> 1:15:46.720]  but my next thing is i'm going to be running creature from jackall island
[1:15:46.720 --> 1:15:49.440]  spots on rush limbaugh you can listen for him
[1:15:49.440 --> 1:15:54.800]  sean hannity um glenn back and then we're also going to be going in we're
[1:15:54.800 --> 1:15:58.880]  also going to be going into uh george nori and uh and dr laura slussinger
[1:15:58.880 --> 1:16:04.000]  which is the the biggest talk shows out there and just start educating those
[1:16:04.000 --> 1:16:06.480]  people so they can start calling in on those shows
[1:16:06.480 --> 1:16:09.920]  and it'll help turn things that's a great way to protect it if you want to
[1:16:09.920 --> 1:16:13.440]  understand the system and you don't yet i would
[1:16:13.440 --> 1:16:16.800]  suggest that you pick up the creature from jackall island book from us i think
[1:16:16.800 --> 1:16:19.200]  ed griffin puts it together pretty well and makes it
[1:16:19.200 --> 1:16:23.280]  interesting uh the book itself sells we're selling for
[1:16:23.280 --> 1:16:26.720]  nineteen ninety five uh with the postage it's six
[1:16:26.720 --> 1:16:30.880]  dollars and fifty cents it's twenty six dollars and forty five cents
[1:16:30.880 --> 1:16:35.040]  we also put a u.s. silver dollar inside of the book we put it into a little
[1:16:35.040 --> 1:16:38.240]  plastic flip and we put it inside of the book so you can actually see what money
[1:16:38.240 --> 1:16:40.960]  really is and the neat part about it is that 19
[1:16:40.960 --> 1:16:44.400]  dollars and 95 cents is what you pay for the silver dollar
[1:16:44.400 --> 1:16:48.160]  if you already know how the fed works and you've read the book fine
[1:16:48.160 --> 1:16:51.280]  buy it take the silver dollar keep it in your pocket
[1:16:51.280 --> 1:16:54.400]  give the book to somebody that needs to understand the system and then tell them
[1:16:54.400 --> 1:16:58.480]  how to get a copy of their own i i think that's the basis of this whole thing
[1:16:58.480 --> 1:17:02.240]  the united states of america needs this education
[1:17:02.240 --> 1:17:06.560]  now worse than ever in addition to this the people of the united states america
[1:17:06.560 --> 1:17:10.480]  are hungry for it five six years ago when the stock market was going up and
[1:17:10.480 --> 1:17:14.400]  everything looked rosy couldn't convince anybody to take this book
[1:17:14.400 --> 1:17:17.600]  now they're starting to buy it and i can tell you right now jason
[1:17:17.600 --> 1:17:20.640]  it's going to mean the difference between having
[1:17:20.640 --> 1:17:24.400]  having liberty in the united states or not having liberty it really comes down
[1:17:24.400 --> 1:17:27.440]  to that the united states of america cannot have liberty
[1:17:27.440 --> 1:17:31.360]  when it's being run by a central bank can't have it it just i agree and you
[1:17:31.360 --> 1:17:34.560]  have newsweek now saying we need a bank of the world
[1:17:34.560 --> 1:17:38.800]  and this is going to be the next talking point god knows how obama is going to
[1:17:38.800 --> 1:17:43.200]  restructure the financial situation i'm i'm pretty worried about it but
[1:17:43.200 --> 1:17:47.120]  for a little piece of mind hard currency silver gold it's what to have
[1:17:47.120 --> 1:17:50.000]  and you know i actually plug the creature from jackall island and that
[1:17:50.000 --> 1:17:53.680]  silver dollar yesterday because i've sat down with uh... g edward griffin
[1:17:53.680 --> 1:17:56.960]  uh... now like three different times and had dinner with him and his lectures
[1:17:56.960 --> 1:18:00.000]  from a world without cancer to the creature from jackall island to his
[1:18:00.000 --> 1:18:04.000]  new world order lecture this guy is well spoken he's well written
[1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:07.920]  and he really does ted break down the financial system to what it really is
[1:18:07.920 --> 1:18:11.360]  well that's the point i mean that's what people need to be educated in
[1:18:11.360 --> 1:18:15.600]  under terms that they can understand i mean everybody understands that well
[1:18:15.600 --> 1:18:18.960]  we have to keep a budget i can spend more than i have so on and so forth
[1:18:18.960 --> 1:18:21.920]  how come the government can spend beyond its budget and the answer to that
[1:18:21.920 --> 1:18:25.040]  question is is that we're not going to have currency for commerce
[1:18:25.040 --> 1:18:28.080]  unless of the united states of america goes further in a debt
[1:18:28.080 --> 1:18:31.760]  think about that for a minute and why would you want to have gold and silver
[1:18:31.760 --> 1:18:35.360]  oh my gosh why would you want to have paper currency over gold and silver
[1:18:35.360 --> 1:18:39.360]  that's the question right now at this particular time you have a better buying
[1:18:39.360 --> 1:18:43.760]  gold just came down uh... about uh... thirty dollars announced and we're
[1:18:43.760 --> 1:18:47.920]  close to seven hundred dollars it's it's about eight eight thirty right now
[1:18:47.920 --> 1:18:52.320]  it obviously is the time to be buying into the precious metals market
[1:18:52.320 --> 1:18:55.360]  whether or not you get into the precious metal metals market is not that
[1:18:55.360 --> 1:18:58.880]  important what's important is that you take the time to educate yourself so
[1:18:58.880 --> 1:19:00.560]  you understand the system
[1:19:00.560 --> 1:19:04.160]  uh... so you can bring this information other people right now we need to be
[1:19:04.160 --> 1:19:04.880]  out there
[1:19:04.880 --> 1:19:08.240]  uh... on our toes i mean just like your the just like your movie you made on
[1:19:08.240 --> 1:19:09.320]  nine eleven
[1:19:09.320 --> 1:19:13.200]  uh... it's that very seed that needs to be planted in the minds so they have a
[1:19:13.200 --> 1:19:14.720]  little bit of a doubt
[1:19:14.720 --> 1:19:18.160]  that that maybe the government's not giving us the right deal right now
[1:19:18.160 --> 1:19:20.120]  maybe it's not what's what
[1:19:20.120 --> 1:19:22.480]  they're really not helping us they're hurting us
[1:19:22.480 --> 1:19:24.320]  and that's exactly what's occurring
[1:19:24.320 --> 1:19:27.480]  the united states government right now is forced into a position
[1:19:27.480 --> 1:19:31.000]  to take on more debt in order for us to have more money in commerce that's what
[1:19:31.000 --> 1:19:33.320]  they're trying to do
[1:19:33.320 --> 1:19:36.200]  ted i agree with you a hundred percent and that's why you need to go to minus
[1:19:36.200 --> 1:19:39.720]  resources right now and pick up some gold and silver and if you do have a
[1:19:39.720 --> 1:19:42.760]  family member a friend that doesn't understand what the federal reserve is

[1:24:15.560 --> 1:24:17.800]  people yeah of course if they want to get all
[1:24:17.800 --> 1:24:23.240]  of us they can catch us at 800 686 2237 and the name that i was
[1:24:23.240 --> 1:24:26.920]  thinking of was barney frank oh you know what we talked about barney frank
[1:24:26.920 --> 1:24:31.080]  extensively today uh... you know you know in the late 80s he was caught with an
[1:24:31.080 --> 1:24:34.280]  underage male brothel running out of his dc home right
[1:24:34.280 --> 1:24:38.840]  now i guess i didn't know that i am i have the time magazine article right
[1:24:38.840 --> 1:24:41.640]  here a skeleton in barney's closet i mean this guy
[1:24:41.640 --> 1:24:44.920]  and he's all over the news to you know nothing ever happened to this guy
[1:24:44.920 --> 1:24:47.800]  it makes me sick that these are the people that are supposedly in charge of
[1:24:47.800 --> 1:24:52.040]  our monetary system ted look they're so bought and paid for it's not even funny
[1:24:52.040 --> 1:24:55.400]  and i here's the way i see it either we stand up and do something we can
[1:24:55.400 --> 1:24:59.720]  possibly in the federal income tax and get back to real currency
[1:24:59.720 --> 1:25:03.160]  or we do nothing and we're gonna end up paying a world tax
[1:25:03.160 --> 1:25:06.760]  to some world ruler and the united states of america
[1:25:06.760 --> 1:25:11.160]  as we see it and the at the constitution is going to become worthless to us
[1:25:11.160 --> 1:25:14.520]  well he's already uh... obama's already putting in more global government
[1:25:14.520 --> 1:25:17.080]  people uh... his climate change czar
[1:25:17.080 --> 1:25:20.520]  is all part of the uh... the world society that's calling for global
[1:25:20.520 --> 1:25:23.880]  uh... governments what's it called it's the sustainable world society it's it's
[1:25:23.880 --> 1:25:27.480]  the it's the way to implement a world tax there's no question about that's what
[1:25:27.480 --> 1:25:31.240]  it is and you can implement a world tax a world bank will work without a world
[1:25:31.240 --> 1:25:35.800]  tax it don't work so you you have to have that the federal reserve system was
[1:25:35.800 --> 1:25:39.720]  implemented in nineteen sixteen and the federal income taxes implemented at the
[1:25:39.720 --> 1:25:43.000]  same time because the federal reserve system has to lend the money to the
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:46.360]  government but the government has to be able to tax the money away from the
[1:25:46.360 --> 1:25:50.200]  people in order to pay back the interest to service service this debt
[1:25:50.200 --> 1:25:53.160]  how do you think the machine works you want to take away the power from the
[1:25:53.160 --> 1:25:53.960]  elite
[1:25:53.960 --> 1:25:57.560]  you kill that system there's only one way to do it because
[1:25:57.560 --> 1:26:00.520]  if you take it away from and you know the system to keep up
[1:26:00.520 --> 1:26:04.200]  they'll buy it back the next day you have to take away that
[1:26:04.200 --> 1:26:07.240]  mechanism in order to stop this craziness
[1:26:07.240 --> 1:26:11.000]  that's bottom line so if you want to pick up that book it's eight hundred six
[1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:12.040]  eight six
[1:26:12.040 --> 1:26:15.560]  two two three seven i suggest everybody read it if you haven't

[1:26:18.680 --> 1:26:21.320]  we all know that there's people out there that have been asking questions
[1:26:21.320 --> 1:26:24.920]  they're all asking questions as to what happened to the economy we all had our
[1:26:24.920 --> 1:26:27.080]  little holiday parties and so on and so forth
[1:26:27.080 --> 1:26:31.080]  the topic is economics right now while the topic's hot get

[1:26:52.600 --> 1:26:55.160]  uh... and it's going to continue to do so and they're going to continue to
[1:26:55.160 --> 1:26:57.960]  reregulate until they have even more control
[1:26:57.960 --> 1:27:01.800]  over our lives uh... before we get marty shactor up here in a few moments
[1:27:01.800 --> 1:27:04.760]  let's go through a few more calls then we're going to have larry pratt of gun
[1:27:04.760 --> 1:27:09.000]  owners of america on later and of course we're going to be talking about the
[1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:12.520]  reregulation of food with jonah stulfitz and uh... morris tomson
[1:27:12.520 --> 1:27:16.680]  swap teams going into you know local farmers homes and i can hit hits home for me
[1:27:16.680 --> 1:27:19.800]  you know not only men nights being taken over but uh...
[1:27:19.800 --> 1:27:23.240]  you know where i live in upstate new york there's a large amish population and
[1:27:23.240 --> 1:27:26.760]  uh... my house is in this uh... parking lot
[1:27:26.760 --> 1:27:30.360]  that's uh... you know it's got the save a lot in the family dollar you know all
[1:27:30.360 --> 1:27:33.720]  very lowbrow stuff but in the parking lot you know the amish park there and
[1:27:33.720 --> 1:27:37.480]  they often uh... sell their produce there and if you want the freshest you
[1:27:37.480 --> 1:27:40.680]  know vegetables usually get them from the amish people
[1:27:40.680 --> 1:27:45.480]  alright let's uh... let's see if we've still got anneal in south dakota anneal
[1:27:45.480 --> 1:27:48.440]  young on
[1:27:48.440 --> 1:27:50.000]  no time i guess
[1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:53.880]  a couple things actually uh... i just uh... woke up to speak here a few weeks
[1:27:53.880 --> 1:27:55.320]  ago my wife and i
[1:27:55.320 --> 1:27:57.480]  and uh... scrambling learn all we can
[1:27:57.480 --> 1:28:00.920]  uh... couple quick questions regarding gold and silver is uh... you know in a
[1:28:00.920 --> 1:28:02.640]  bar society it seems like
[1:28:02.640 --> 1:28:04.920]  uh... a silver denomination to be better
[1:28:04.920 --> 1:28:06.360]  you know smaller the better
[1:28:06.360 --> 1:28:09.800]  as far as investment purposes you know uh... to my goal to perhaps be a better
[1:28:09.800 --> 1:28:11.560]  way to go with your thoughts on that
[1:28:11.560 --> 1:28:15.200]  well here in my that's a very good point you can get the
[1:28:15.200 --> 1:28:18.440]  silver pieces that are marked ten and twenty dollars so obviously if you're
[1:28:18.440 --> 1:28:21.960]  just trying to get across a border or get from state to state or get us
[1:28:21.960 --> 1:28:24.520]  small goods and services the silver is great to have
[1:28:24.520 --> 1:28:29.160]  now gold in you know one on one ounce eat no matter what it's trading at
[1:28:29.160 --> 1:28:31.000]  usually can't get it for less than
[1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:34.360]  maybe a less than a thousand dollars online on ebay you know that's what i
[1:28:34.360 --> 1:28:35.360]  usually go to
[1:28:35.360 --> 1:28:37.520]  ebay usually has some pretty
[1:28:37.520 --> 1:28:40.880]  low prices and it gives you good idea what you're gonna pay for now you don't
[1:28:40.880 --> 1:28:42.800]  always have to get an ounce of gold
[1:28:42.800 --> 1:28:43.440]  so
[1:28:43.440 --> 1:28:44.960]  you know if you're rocking
[1:28:44.960 --> 1:28:47.160]  a ben franklin your wallet a hundred dollar bill
[1:28:47.160 --> 1:28:49.520]  maybe if you get a a fifth ounce piece
[1:28:49.520 --> 1:28:52.280]  you know that'll that'll be a couple hundred dollars or worth maybe two fifty
[1:28:52.280 --> 1:28:53.080]  so that's
[1:28:53.080 --> 1:28:54.960]  a barter type denomination
[1:28:54.960 --> 1:28:55.680]  uh...
[1:28:55.680 --> 1:28:57.080]  i agree gold
[1:28:57.080 --> 1:28:59.080]  obviously has
[1:28:59.080 --> 1:29:02.640]  gain in value more than silver at least on the surface but so silver
[1:29:02.640 --> 1:29:06.160]  is a good denomination to have small barter than five ten
[1:29:06.160 --> 1:29:08.160]  twenty twenty five dollar purchases
[1:29:08.160 --> 1:29:10.520]  i think they're both a good buy if i had
[1:29:10.520 --> 1:29:13.320]  more money which i don't you know i'm i'm a pretty uh...
[1:29:13.320 --> 1:29:16.480]  poor guy i'd get gold in the heartbeat all i have is a little bit of silver and
[1:29:16.480 --> 1:29:19.360]  when i say a little bit of silver it's it's a very little bit
[1:29:19.360 --> 1:29:20.240]  okay
[1:29:20.240 --> 1:29:23.960]  that sounds great and then i'm going to jump topics will quick on you uh...
[1:29:23.960 --> 1:29:25.360]  well i think it's
[1:29:25.360 --> 1:29:27.240]  go ahead real quick one
[1:29:27.240 --> 1:29:29.320]  one thing that's really worth it to try to figure out what to do with the

[1:44:13.800 --> 1:44:16.680]  i appreciate you taking the call i've been trying to get through to you guys for a
[1:44:16.680 --> 1:44:21.560]  while hey i just wanted to reiterate to you uh a little bit about propaganda
[1:44:21.560 --> 1:44:25.720]  because i believe that that is what is keeping this whole
[1:44:25.720 --> 1:44:30.200]  master's you know metastasization of cancer alive and it's the only thing
[1:44:30.200 --> 1:44:34.120]  that that gives them any power and you were talking about um
[1:44:34.120 --> 1:44:38.360]  metallica recently i know you're a fan i've been a fan as well until i really
[1:44:38.360 --> 1:44:42.600]  woke up and and realized who these in morons are and in who's
[1:44:42.600 --> 1:44:45.720]  supporting them okay uh and you were talking about the chem
[1:44:45.720 --> 1:44:49.000]  trails and in how they're they're basically it you you
[1:44:49.000 --> 1:44:52.920]  viewed this this video is trying to stay almost like
[1:44:52.920 --> 1:44:56.120]  these chem trails are a good thing yeah yeah it's absolutely have you seen the
[1:44:56.120 --> 1:44:58.680]  video and by the way you're you're a little out you can just turn down a
[1:44:58.680 --> 1:45:01.720]  little bit and uh yeah have you seen the video for all nightmare long
[1:45:01.720 --> 1:45:04.360]  basically it's it talks about how the soviets
[1:45:04.360 --> 1:45:08.360]  are trying to zombify the population and the reason that there's high levels of
[1:45:08.360 --> 1:45:12.040]  barium and arsenic in the chem trails because they start playing news clips
[1:45:12.040 --> 1:45:15.080]  is because that's what suppresses the zombification
[1:45:15.080 --> 1:45:20.040]  and they basically are saying that the chem trails are there to protect us
[1:45:20.040 --> 1:45:23.800]  right so you know i'm sorry if i'm talking loud just tell me again
[1:45:23.800 --> 1:45:26.120]  no you're good now your your level is a lot better
[1:45:26.120 --> 1:45:29.960]  okay so basically you know i don't know which who was if it was Leonardo da
[1:45:29.960 --> 1:45:33.400]  Vinci it was some greek uh some philosopher that it said if you can
[1:45:33.400 --> 1:45:38.040]  control the music then you can control the society so
[1:45:38.040 --> 1:45:42.520]  what i just wanted to reiterate was that propaganda is going on all the time
[1:45:42.520 --> 1:45:45.720]  through through music and through these morons that are that are producing
[1:45:45.720 --> 1:45:49.960]  their music and a lot of people don't realize because you know i love
[1:45:49.960 --> 1:45:54.280]  metallica's music man but you know i i woke up from you and your efforts in
[1:45:54.280 --> 1:45:57.720]  jalex jones you know only the last couple months i've done hours and hours of
[1:45:57.720 --> 1:46:01.240]  research and you know i realized that you know these guys are
[1:46:01.240 --> 1:46:04.680]  are working with the illuminati and they're working with their cause and
[1:46:04.680 --> 1:46:08.200]  they're supported and funded by these people i mean i don't know i'm going
[1:46:08.200 --> 1:46:12.200]  to say that that's what i believe and that's why i believe that these guys
[1:46:12.200 --> 1:46:15.400]  produce that propaganda and if you listen to the new album
[1:46:15.400 --> 1:46:18.760]  i mean the new album is probably the greatest musical piece that they've
[1:46:18.760 --> 1:46:22.120]  ever done but if you listen to the words it's pretty awesome you know you can
[1:46:22.120 --> 1:46:25.400]  you can see what what these people are trying to to put into
[1:46:25.400 --> 1:46:29.720]  into children's head and what for one let's just talk about uh the song on
[1:46:29.720 --> 1:46:31.720]  nightmare long and i and i thank you for the call i mean
[1:46:31.720 --> 1:46:36.120]  obviously you know music and culture is promoted by these people you know
[1:46:36.120 --> 1:46:39.880]  is especially live the rap culture i mean and i like a lot of rap and huge
[1:46:39.880 --> 1:46:44.360]  wu-tang clan fan all that stuff um
[1:46:44.360 --> 1:46:48.360]  in all nightmare long they have a line in there the light that uh is not light is
[1:46:48.360 --> 1:46:50.840]  here uh to come and flush you out with your own
[1:46:50.840 --> 1:46:54.520]  fear you hide you hide uh but null is found you know
[1:46:54.520 --> 1:46:58.760]  in basically you give up and then it's also it you know feel us breathe upon
[1:46:58.760 --> 1:47:02.440]  your face um feel a shift every move we trace
[1:47:02.440 --> 1:47:06.200]  so it does have those undertones maybe even overtones
[1:47:06.200 --> 1:47:10.040]  i would say of i don't know exposing
[1:47:10.040 --> 1:47:14.120]  i guess this system and then i remember kill them all they had uh the four
[1:47:14.120 --> 1:47:18.200]  horsemen was all about the apocalypse they've had anti-new world order stuff
[1:47:18.200 --> 1:47:23.240]  in their songs before and you know it seems like they do promote the war i
[1:47:23.240 --> 1:47:26.600]  mean their first video is you know an iraqian surgeon we're not going to be
[1:47:26.600 --> 1:47:29.800]  playing that that one uh basically the troops are there to
[1:47:29.800 --> 1:47:33.400]  help under this high stress situation they don't actually shoot anybody
[1:47:33.400 --> 1:47:37.080]  i don't know if i disagree or agree with you i mean obviously
[1:47:37.080 --> 1:47:40.920]  popular culture is used by the globalists to
[1:47:40.920 --> 1:47:44.360]  i mean look at obama it's it's all about i mean oprah winfrey
[1:47:44.360 --> 1:47:48.600]  and they used oprah you know oprah first black man but let's use oprah oprah
[1:47:48.600 --> 1:47:51.960]  promote this guy he's he's well spoken he seems reasonable
[1:47:51.960 --> 1:47:57.560]  he's gonna he's gonna he's gonna follow the same script of all these guys
[1:47:57.560 --> 1:48:03.000]  only he's here to unite us under conscription all right let's go to
[1:48:03.000 --> 1:48:06.280]  john in michigan john what's on your mind
[1:48:06.280 --> 1:48:11.160]  going on hello yes you're on hey what's going on jason it's a pleasure to finally
[1:48:11.160 --> 1:48:14.040]  talk to you i've been a big fan of what you and alex
[1:48:14.040 --> 1:48:18.040]  jones have done for a long long time all right thanks man i couldn't actually i
[1:48:18.040 --> 1:48:21.880]  couldn't actually had a better setup you know i have an independent record label
[1:48:21.880 --> 1:48:27.320]  actually what we do is hip-hop music and we really really really try to bring
[1:48:27.320 --> 1:48:31.080]  you know light to the situation to try to wake people up like i was woke up
[1:48:31.080 --> 1:48:34.680]  through road to tyranny and i don't know why
[1:48:34.680 --> 1:48:39.080]  it seems like we can't get together and and like fight what they do
[1:48:39.080 --> 1:48:43.720]  the same way with our truth you know like you alex maybe people like a
[1:48:43.720 --> 1:48:47.000]  mortal technique he made me a little bit harsh but what he says is just
[1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:50.600]  you know he's so intelligent and he speaks the truth why you can't get
[1:48:50.600 --> 1:48:53.960]  together and do like a tour all right i'll tell you why
[1:48:53.960 --> 1:48:57.000]  because because first of all they're opposing record labels and they don't
[1:48:57.000 --> 1:48:58.840]  want that and like all right let's look at a
[1:48:58.840 --> 1:49:01.640]  let's look at the flowbots album you know whether you love it or hate it i
[1:49:01.640 --> 1:49:04.440]  personally i thought the whole album was really well done
[1:49:04.440 --> 1:49:08.040]  handlebars was a big hit it was all over the radio but they didn't even get a
[1:49:08.040 --> 1:49:11.000]  chance at a second single you know i read the rolling
[1:49:11.000 --> 1:49:16.120]  stone's top 100 albums they put chinese democracy in the top 10
[1:49:16.120 --> 1:49:19.560]  and the flowbots were nowhere to be seen you know these guys had
[1:49:19.560 --> 1:49:23.000]  and out of nowhere hit the album was politically relevant
[1:49:23.000 --> 1:49:25.720]  and it just gets squashed they made their they made enough money with them
[1:49:25.720 --> 1:49:27.880]  we're going to put on the shelf same with a mortal technique
[1:49:27.880 --> 1:49:32.040]  uh... in the third world which is a really not even a full album it's
[1:49:32.040 --> 1:49:34.840]  it's a mixtape he put out with rebel arms and uh...
[1:49:34.840 --> 1:49:37.560]  green lantern one of the biggest hip-hop dj's out there
[1:49:37.560 --> 1:49:41.720]  it's awesome you know i nine out of my ten friends don't even know it exists
[1:49:41.720 --> 1:49:44.360]  you know i'll be playing the car like who's this i'm like you know this is a
[1:49:44.360 --> 1:49:46.680]  mortal technique he goes on tour with method man
[1:49:46.680 --> 1:49:50.600]  he's a really talented rapper revolutionary value one and two
[1:49:50.600 --> 1:49:53.800]  they've heard a couple of his songs maybe but it's because
[1:49:53.800 --> 1:49:57.880]  the powers that be will not get behind this you know st paris is a talented
[1:49:57.880 --> 1:50:00.840]  guy you know what i mean and it seems when even a
[1:50:00.840 --> 1:50:04.200]  mainline rapper tries to take on the establishment
[1:50:04.200 --> 1:50:06.920]  with a politically relevant song like m&m
[1:50:06.920 --> 1:50:11.560]  literally at the time in 2004 the biggest rapper in the entire world
[1:50:11.560 --> 1:50:14.920]  he does mosh where he has a puppet bin laden
[1:50:14.920 --> 1:50:19.560]  and uh... cheney and rumsfeld laughing and joking behind a stage
[1:50:19.560 --> 1:50:23.240]  after he he props down well that was number one on mtv for a week and then
[1:50:23.240 --> 1:50:25.400]  mtv pulled it
[1:50:25.400 --> 1:50:29.400]  you're starting to see what you know why that is so difficult to put together
[1:50:29.400 --> 1:50:32.360]  oh absolutely like i said i've been trying to do this for years you know
[1:50:32.360 --> 1:50:36.360]  well that's what we do at primal rage and like
[1:50:36.360 --> 1:50:39.560]  but you guys don't get the mainstream play you know through the internet and

[1:54:14.600 --> 1:54:18.440]  we are back it's the alex jones show and we're talking about you know how can we
[1:54:18.440 --> 1:54:22.040]  get
[1:54:22.040 --> 1:54:26.600]  artists out there musical artists on tour with one another to bring this
[1:54:26.600 --> 1:54:28.760]  message obviously we have a ton of them are awake
[1:54:28.760 --> 1:54:32.760]  you know krs one he's coming to austin texas on the 24th i believe we had a
[1:54:32.760 --> 1:54:35.480]  caller about that yesterday that should be uh
[1:54:35.480 --> 1:54:38.280]  that should be great we should be getting him on the show um you know
[1:54:38.280 --> 1:54:41.160]  obviously we've had paris on the program we've had a mortal technique on the
[1:54:41.160 --> 1:54:45.640]  program you know head pe who's a platinum selling artist you know 2003's
[1:54:45.640 --> 1:54:49.160]  blackout went platinum uh they've got an album out today called new world
[1:54:49.160 --> 1:54:52.920]  orphans and that's off of sub-noise records
[1:54:52.920 --> 1:54:56.520]  you know they're very well aware they hand out literature at their shows
[1:54:56.520 --> 1:54:59.960]  there's a lot of them out out there but why can't we get together well a lot of
[1:54:59.960 --> 1:55:03.160]  them are owned by separate labels or their independence and then on top of
[1:55:03.160 --> 1:55:06.280]  that you have to get past scheduling problems but the main underlying
[1:55:06.280 --> 1:55:10.200]  um issue i think matt out in jersey is that
[1:55:10.200 --> 1:55:13.000]  you know the establishment doesn't want to promote promote these types of things
[1:55:13.000 --> 1:55:15.640]  they want to promote concerts like live eight
[1:55:15.640 --> 1:55:19.320]  where you know we can get behind global warming and there's a massive brain
[1:55:19.320 --> 1:55:23.000]  washing taking place there you know it's going to take efforts of people like
[1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:26.440]  yourself and others in order to make that happen
[1:55:26.440 --> 1:55:29.800]  you know and and it's actually john out in michigan
[1:55:29.800 --> 1:55:34.040]  oh i'm sorry and this is what i'm talking about because i faced this we've
[1:55:34.040 --> 1:55:37.480]  been doing this for 10 years and i faced this problem for so long
[1:55:37.480 --> 1:55:40.680]  and like just getting on the radio if you have a message and stuff is is
[1:55:40.680 --> 1:55:44.040]  impossible especially unless you're starting to a major record deal you'll
[1:55:44.040 --> 1:55:46.920]  never hear a mortal technique in my neck of the wood
[1:55:46.920 --> 1:55:50.520]  you know you'll never see your videos in my neck with you have to hunt them down
[1:55:50.520 --> 1:55:53.720]  and this is why we should work together you know this is why when you're out in
[1:55:53.720 --> 1:55:56.920]  new york and everything else we should all band together and
[1:55:56.920 --> 1:56:00.120]  and try to do it through the internet and try to keep spreading the word i mean
[1:56:00.120 --> 1:56:04.120]  if you pull up a mortal technique his plays are phenomenal he's got over a
[1:56:04.120 --> 1:56:06.840]  million views on youtube and everything else you know
[1:56:06.840 --> 1:56:11.080]  and this is all we have he's amazing you know and and you know he's a big
[1:56:11.080 --> 1:56:15.400]  influence on me and you know i would i will offer our music to you to
[1:56:15.400 --> 1:56:19.480]  use in any of your videos for free oh we're
[1:56:19.480 --> 1:56:22.280]  and you know take a take a look myspace.com

[1:56:40.600 --> 1:56:44.840]  and and just work as a cohesive unit that's the only way
[1:56:44.840 --> 1:56:48.200]  through the internet and through getting people to listen to our stuff
[1:56:48.200 --> 1:56:51.240]  that are educated that's the only way we're going to be able to move forward
[1:56:51.240 --> 1:56:54.520]  and actually take down the new world order you gotta be able to agree with you
[1:56:54.520 --> 1:56:57.720]  john i really think that we do have to band forces and we have to put our
[1:56:57.720 --> 1:57:01.400]  message out in this pulp or this uh pop culture society
[1:57:01.400 --> 1:57:04.360]  and uh you know put it out there to the youth because the youth are the only
[1:57:04.360 --> 1:57:06.440]  ones that are going to change it all right i only got time for

[1:57:28.440 --> 1:57:33.960]  um i wanted to call about uh uh bit those on my local news about a week ago
[1:57:33.960 --> 1:57:37.720]  it said computer tech private investigators in texas have you heard
[1:57:37.720 --> 1:57:41.640]  about this nope okay it says state lawmakers passed
[1:57:41.640 --> 1:57:45.080]  the bill back in two set 2007 the representative with the texas house
[1:57:45.080 --> 1:57:48.040]  committee on law enforcement says under the current language
[1:57:48.040 --> 1:57:52.360]  house bill 2833 can be interpreted to mean computer tech so required to be
[1:57:52.360 --> 1:57:55.720]  privatized oh you know jones did a story about this
[1:57:55.720 --> 1:57:58.840]  last year but continue okay so they say the bill
[1:57:58.840 --> 1:58:02.360]  intended for law enforcement officials not computer techs it was really meant
[1:58:02.360 --> 1:58:06.760]  for investigative purposes um and it goes on and talks
[1:58:06.760 --> 1:58:10.680]  about it but basically it basically brings a
[1:58:10.680 --> 1:58:14.120]  snoop into your home without knowing and if he sees anything bad on your
[1:58:14.120 --> 1:58:17.320]  computer you know anything he deems inappropriate he's going to report you
[1:58:17.320 --> 1:58:20.920]  to the authorities and you can be investigated from there it's very

[2:01:25.800 --> 2:01:29.320]  carrying conceal permit you know i know it varies from state to state but in my
[2:01:29.320 --> 2:01:31.880]  state of new york it's almost impossible to get a
[2:01:31.880 --> 2:01:35.880]  conceal and carry out permit unless you're a you know former law officer a
[2:01:35.880 --> 2:01:39.560]  former military officer and even then it's not guaranteed so

[2:01:55.400 --> 2:01:59.640]  one more time i guess about this uh obama climate change czar
[2:01:59.640 --> 2:02:04.280]  who has socialist ties carol m browner president
[2:02:04.280 --> 2:02:08.760]  elect obama's pick as global warming czar was listed as one of 14 leaders of
[2:02:08.760 --> 2:02:12.360]  the socialist groups commissioned for a sustainable world society that's the
[2:02:12.360 --> 2:02:15.720]  commission for a sustainable world society whenever they're calling for a
[2:02:15.720 --> 2:02:19.160]  sustainable world uh society and people like you know
[2:02:19.160 --> 2:02:23.000]  gordon brown are the heads of it you know we should play that clip we got a
[2:02:23.000 --> 2:02:25.640]  couple minutes can we play that gordon brown on new world order
[2:02:25.640 --> 2:02:29.800]  speech again and you know gordon brown is so
[2:02:29.800 --> 2:02:34.200]  pro-world government it is mind-boggling to me
[2:02:34.200 --> 2:02:39.320]  it's more than mind-boggling to me that people don't understand that the new
[2:02:39.320 --> 2:02:43.560]  world order is real it's on the cover of their newspapers there and this is uh
[2:02:43.560 --> 2:02:48.680]  him before he's even elected um you know this is the guy that's the
[2:02:48.680 --> 2:02:51.800]  successor to tony blare you don't see him in the press as much as you did with
[2:02:51.800 --> 2:02:54.120]  tony but we only saw tony because we were in a
[2:02:54.120 --> 2:02:59.000]  a war crisis but let's go to that clip about the biggest restructuring we have
[2:02:59.000 --> 2:03:03.240]  ever seen not just of the global economy but of the global order as a
[2:03:03.240 --> 2:03:06.600]  whole and 200 years ago a famous british foreign
[2:03:06.600 --> 2:03:09.800]  secretary said that the new world had been called into
[2:03:09.800 --> 2:03:14.360]  existence to redress the balance of the old in 1990
[2:03:14.360 --> 2:03:18.840]  another old world ended dominated by the cold war
[2:03:18.840 --> 2:03:22.920]  and people talk then in 1990 of a new world order
[2:03:22.920 --> 2:03:25.800]  what they actually meant then was a new political order
[2:03:25.800 --> 2:03:30.360]  and what was not foreseen then but is obvious now from everything that we see
[2:03:30.360 --> 2:03:33.720]  and do what we experience in every day of our life
[2:03:33.720 --> 2:03:37.480]  is the sheer scale and speed and scope of globalization
[2:03:37.480 --> 2:03:41.400]  and it's only now that we can begin to understand that the world order
[2:03:41.400 --> 2:03:45.880]  that globalization brings and what it's going to look like it's driven forward
[2:03:45.880 --> 2:03:49.960]  now not just by the balance of military strength the cold war times
[2:03:49.960 --> 2:03:54.760]  or ordinary political power it's been driven forward by a seismic shift
[2:03:54.760 --> 2:03:59.160]  in economic power that we see around us but what does the new world order mean
[2:03:59.160 --> 2:04:03.480]  for countries like ours who are looking to succeed
[2:04:03.480 --> 2:04:06.040]  i suggest that the countries that are going to succeed
[2:04:06.040 --> 2:04:09.480]  are those that combine flexibility free trade
[2:04:09.480 --> 2:04:13.240]  open markets with proper stewardship of the environment
[2:04:13.240 --> 2:04:18.200]  and investment in education infrastructure and innovation
[2:04:18.200 --> 2:04:21.960]  and the question for us is how we meet and master all these challenges
[2:04:21.960 --> 2:04:26.280]  to ensure that britain enhances its competitiveness in the process
[2:04:26.280 --> 2:04:30.120]  and realizes what i believe is our destiny
[2:04:30.120 --> 2:04:37.480]  of success in this new world order so in conclusion ladies and gentlemen
[2:04:37.480 --> 2:04:40.760]  well there you have it he says new world order i think three more times in 20
[2:04:40.760 --> 2:04:43.640]  seconds uh that's what this you know sustainable
[2:04:43.640 --> 2:04:46.760]  society is about is about a global government global tax and uh that's
[2:04:46.760 --> 2:04:49.800]  why obama appointed this woman we'll be back after this it's the alex

[2:08:38.280 --> 2:08:41.480]  warming swindle or or we did that the other day and somebody else called
[2:08:41.480 --> 2:08:44.600]  about the great global warming swindle and it's uh
[2:08:44.600 --> 2:08:48.360]  it's a patent piece well it's because the people that they bring in
[2:08:48.360 --> 2:08:52.360]  using global warming as a guise like this global warming zycarol m
[2:08:52.360 --> 2:08:56.600]  browner are really members of the world sustainable society
[2:08:56.600 --> 2:09:00.600]  and are calling for global governance right on their websites

[2:09:12.920 --> 2:09:16.760]  amendment rights of gun owners see folks these are the real deal they're not
[2:09:16.760 --> 2:09:20.120]  the nr a they're not all about gun regulation and grabbing your
[2:09:20.120 --> 2:09:23.480]  semi-automatic and automatic weapons but their pro second amendment
[2:09:23.480 --> 2:09:26.760]  larry thank you for joining me well it's a pleasure to be with you thanks for
[2:09:26.760 --> 2:09:29.880]  having me no thanks for coming on the show
[2:09:29.880 --> 2:09:33.240]  you know we had a caller earlier today asking about um
[2:09:33.240 --> 2:09:36.600]  and conceal and carry permits and i know that uh
[2:09:36.600 --> 2:09:40.040]  that it differs from state to state you know in new york where i live it's
[2:09:40.040 --> 2:09:43.880]  awfully hard to get one i believe he was out of uh south dakota
[2:09:43.880 --> 2:09:47.480]  uh do you know anything about the uh the regulations there
[2:09:47.480 --> 2:09:51.480]  there um as far as conceal carry regulations are concerned because there
[2:09:51.480 --> 2:09:56.360]  are two states that happily have none uh you just carry as a matter of right
[2:09:56.360 --> 2:10:01.400]  vermont and alaska but south dakota is certainly among the most
[2:10:01.400 --> 2:10:07.400]  easy to get uh the permit and a huge percentage of the population at one time
[2:10:07.400 --> 2:10:11.800]  i think there was something that like at least a tenth of the adult population
[2:10:11.800 --> 2:10:18.360]  has such a permit which is uh partly the uh explainable because it has been on
[2:10:18.360 --> 2:10:21.320]  the books the law their laws been on the books so long and
[2:10:21.320 --> 2:10:25.320]  we see that every year that there's something like this on the books
[2:10:25.320 --> 2:10:28.280]  more and more people get around to taking advantage of it
[2:10:28.280 --> 2:10:33.240]  and uh you know the pity is that uh americans have grown accustomed to thinking
[2:10:33.240 --> 2:10:37.320]  that we can't do something without the government telling us that we can do it
[2:10:37.320 --> 2:10:40.440]  we think it's better to have a a permit law than
[2:10:40.440 --> 2:10:43.880]  a prohibition but we certainly think it's much better still
[2:10:43.880 --> 2:10:47.640]  to have something like vermont or alaska where no permit
[2:10:47.640 --> 2:10:51.640]  is needed yeah and it's not like a crime is out of control in vermont in fact
[2:10:51.640 --> 2:10:54.760]  it's one of the nicest places i that i visit up in the northeast
[2:10:54.760 --> 2:10:58.120]  uh when i get out of upstate new york it's gorgeous the people are great
[2:10:58.120 --> 2:11:01.800]  you would never really know that you know people were carrying weapons
[2:11:01.800 --> 2:11:05.000]  because it's just so second nature there is no real violence there
[2:11:05.000 --> 2:11:09.560]  i ask a police uh official one time in their state police because it's an
[2:11:09.560 --> 2:11:13.720]  issue that comes up when you're talking to politicians and
[2:11:13.720 --> 2:11:17.000]  police officials not necessarily rank and file
[2:11:17.000 --> 2:11:21.000]  uh in other states and especially when concealed carry making it easier
[2:11:21.000 --> 2:11:25.560]  for concealed carry legislation comes up i said so how do you guys handle the
[2:11:25.560 --> 2:11:29.560]  fact that there's no computer database available to the state police when they
[2:11:29.560 --> 2:11:33.240]  pull somebody over otherwise are approaching a suspect
[2:11:33.240 --> 2:11:36.520]  how do they handle not knowing whether or not the guy
[2:11:36.520 --> 2:11:40.840]  uh has a concealed carry permit since you don't have them he said well listen
[2:11:40.840 --> 2:11:45.480]  any police officer regardless of what his computer is telling him that
[2:11:45.480 --> 2:11:49.720]  the person he just pulled over whatever oh he has no concealed carry permit
[2:11:49.720 --> 2:11:53.640]  therefore i can go up there chewing bubble gum and looking at the stars
[2:11:53.640 --> 2:11:56.360]  uh you know he's putting his life in his hands
[2:11:56.360 --> 2:12:01.080]  uh and he better assume uh he doesn't have to be a jerk about it but he just
[2:12:01.080 --> 2:12:05.640]  better be on his guard that uh the guy could be armed because the bad guy
[2:12:05.640 --> 2:12:10.360]  isn't going to be in the system anyway yeah exactly the guy that's actually
[2:12:10.360 --> 2:12:13.480]  going to pull a gun on you yeah isn't going to be the guy that has the
[2:12:13.480 --> 2:12:17.080]  concealed carry permit he's going to be the guy that has warrants out for his
[2:12:17.080 --> 2:12:20.680]  arrest and knows it and knows if he has an interaction with this cop more than
[2:12:20.680 --> 2:12:23.720]  five minutes that he's going to jail and that's when you see
[2:12:23.720 --> 2:12:26.840]  i mean i see him all the time when you're watching uh spike tv and you're
[2:12:26.840 --> 2:12:30.280]  watching these confrontations it's never a guy with an actual permit it's the
[2:12:30.280 --> 2:12:33.560]  guys outside of the car you know waiting for the officer to move and then they
[2:12:33.560 --> 2:12:37.560]  shoot him in fact the one advantage that i can think of
[2:12:37.560 --> 2:12:41.240]  and it's a temporary advantage i would like to think
[2:12:41.240 --> 2:12:45.560]  of having concealed carry permit holders is that when you do the
[2:12:45.560 --> 2:12:49.880]  the research and you find out what the crime rate is among those folks
[2:12:49.880 --> 2:12:53.240]  versus the rest of the population that does not have them
[2:12:53.240 --> 2:12:57.000]  the folks that are carrying concealed and have a permit to do so
[2:12:57.000 --> 2:13:01.640]  have about 90 to 95 percent less violent crime
[2:13:01.640 --> 2:13:05.720]  than the rest of the population so when we hear
[2:13:05.720 --> 2:13:09.080]  how much that we're putting people in danger
[2:13:09.080 --> 2:13:13.080]  to give everybody the opportunity to be carrying a gun
[2:13:13.080 --> 2:13:16.120]  we should think that the proper answer is
[2:13:16.120 --> 2:13:19.480]  oh well good let's see if we can expand it because frankly
[2:13:19.480 --> 2:13:24.520]  wouldn't lowering everybody's crime rate to 95 percent like the existing
[2:13:24.520 --> 2:13:28.520]  carry folks wouldn't that be a worthwhile objective
[2:13:28.520 --> 2:13:31.720]  you would think that but the uh you know the numbers are always fudged and the
[2:13:31.720 --> 2:13:35.960]  fear is always uh predicated in the media oh these people with gone
[2:13:35.960 --> 2:13:41.160]  dangerous and they want to control us and obviously control is a bit more
[2:13:41.160 --> 2:13:45.000]  problematic if everybody's armed as george the third
[2:13:45.000 --> 2:13:49.240]  wasn't that a bit of a difficulty absolutely and that's why you see this
[2:13:49.240 --> 2:13:53.560]  attack on the second amendment i'd like to get your
[2:13:53.560 --> 2:13:57.400]  your views on this incoming administration where we're now a week away
[2:13:57.400 --> 2:14:00.840]  uh from the obama administration being sworn in
[2:14:00.840 --> 2:14:04.360]  just telling me that there's only seven days until
[2:14:04.360 --> 2:14:09.000]  obama is not a settling thing to think about
[2:14:09.000 --> 2:14:11.960]  i know you're right and it hasn't been exactly a bullet
[2:14:11.960 --> 2:14:15.960]  cherries under bush hardly but uh obama
[2:14:15.960 --> 2:14:20.440]  yeah it's it's unsettling and why is it so unsettling for you i mean i mean now
[2:14:20.440 --> 2:14:23.240]  we you know obviously you have the people that went out and bought guns
[2:14:23.240 --> 2:14:26.440]  there's record sales out there and ammunition thinking that he's going to
[2:14:26.440 --> 2:14:29.000]  come after their gun rights and i and i think that's
[2:14:29.000 --> 2:14:33.080]  a real fear i can see and i can see him uh you know
[2:14:33.080 --> 2:14:36.600]  going to the people and asking for this and then that the media portraying in
[2:14:36.600 --> 2:14:39.800]  such a way that we really don't have a choice that's how many people are behind
[2:14:39.800 --> 2:14:44.040]  this obama movement oh yeah well obama's got a record as a state
[2:14:44.040 --> 2:14:48.120]  senator especially because he was there for a while
[2:14:48.120 --> 2:14:52.840]  uh as a real gun banner he doesn't think people should have guns
[2:14:52.840 --> 2:14:56.680]  unless they are working for the government um
[2:14:56.680 --> 2:15:00.600]  and if i had to choose between groups of the population i would say
[2:15:00.600 --> 2:15:04.600]  everybody except those working for the government after they work for us they
[2:15:04.600 --> 2:15:07.240]  don't work for the government that's supposed to be foreign by the people
[2:15:07.240 --> 2:15:09.960]  yeah yeah so if we're going to be disarming people
[2:15:09.960 --> 2:15:13.320]  which i'm not advocating then it ought to be those that work for the government
[2:15:13.320 --> 2:15:16.360]  let's get this straight they work for us and they
[2:15:16.360 --> 2:15:20.360]  should do whatever it is we tell them even if it's a bit goofy
[2:15:20.360 --> 2:15:23.400]  and they can always not work for us if they don't like
[2:15:23.400 --> 2:15:28.760]  those terms but so we got a guy that's really anti-gun and he's got a background
[2:15:28.760 --> 2:15:33.320]  that you just can't get away from he's tried to do what so many politicians do
[2:15:33.320 --> 2:15:38.200]  and sound like he's a man of the middle i think he's simply playing
[2:15:38.200 --> 2:15:42.840]  the Hegelian dialectic he votes one way he talks another
[2:15:42.840 --> 2:15:45.880]  and he makes you think oh good he's finally come to his senses
[2:15:45.880 --> 2:15:51.480]  so your guard goes down and wham the synthesis is gotcha
[2:15:51.480 --> 2:15:56.680]  so this guy um it has put in for example as a nominee
[2:15:56.680 --> 2:16:01.480]  for attorney general uh the the fellow that was there at the
[2:16:01.480 --> 2:16:06.360]  justice department during the joyful events of Waco
[2:16:06.360 --> 2:16:13.640]  he's the guy that went and tried to get the Puerto Rican terrorists to
[2:16:13.640 --> 2:16:17.480]  accept a pardon they had not been seeking one
[2:16:17.480 --> 2:16:22.360]  they thought it would somehow stain the pristine nature
[2:16:22.360 --> 2:16:25.960]  of their just cause you know they'd only
[2:16:25.960 --> 2:16:32.280]  shot a few people in an invasion of the washington and the congress bed you
[2:16:32.280 --> 2:16:35.400]  know that's a little little stuff like that a long time ago
[2:16:35.400 --> 2:16:39.160]  and so they actually deliberated whether or not to accept
[2:16:39.160 --> 2:16:42.440]  the pardon from clinton and this was something that
[2:16:42.440 --> 2:16:47.480]  holder himself did and it bypassed even the normal
[2:16:47.480 --> 2:16:52.360]  pardon office in the clinton administration so this guy
[2:16:52.360 --> 2:16:55.960]  is somebody who works around the law works around
[2:16:55.960 --> 2:17:00.280]  established procedures and he does it to benefit
[2:17:00.280 --> 2:17:03.800]  people who are convicted of murder and mayhem
[2:17:03.800 --> 2:17:08.920]  meanwhile he would like to put average gun owners in jail he signed on to
[2:17:08.920 --> 2:17:11.960]  the friend of the court brief along with Janet Reno
[2:17:11.960 --> 2:17:18.440]  that was opposing the overturn of the dc gun ban
[2:17:18.440 --> 2:17:22.200]  he was in favor of people not being able to protect themselves
[2:17:22.200 --> 2:17:26.520]  and obviously there's a penalty in the district and pretty much even now
[2:17:26.520 --> 2:17:30.520]  yeah you can have a handgun if you crawl over glass stand on your head and do a
[2:17:30.520 --> 2:17:34.360]  few a few other ridiculous things you might be able to get your permit
[2:17:34.360 --> 2:17:38.280]  in the district of columbia well holder thinks that's just fine the more
[2:17:38.280 --> 2:17:41.720]  difficult the better impossible better still
[2:17:41.720 --> 2:17:45.400]  at least possible legally obviously the crooks
[2:17:45.400 --> 2:17:48.680]  got their guns quite readily in the district of columbia
[2:17:48.680 --> 2:17:51.640]  but i really don't think that bothers these folks because they don't see
[2:17:51.640 --> 2:17:56.280]  crooks as a threat to them and to their system
[2:17:56.280 --> 2:18:01.800]  i didn't say our government there their system they see crooks as people
[2:18:01.800 --> 2:18:06.600]  who are on the margin and not with any political agenda
[2:18:06.600 --> 2:18:12.120]  they view people like alex jones like gun owners of america
[2:18:12.120 --> 2:18:15.480]  as having an agenda that's opposed to theirs that's
[2:18:15.480 --> 2:18:20.120]  what bothers them they want to control us they don't care about controlling the
[2:18:20.120 --> 2:18:22.920]  criminals because they're largely irrelevant
[2:18:22.920 --> 2:18:26.680]  but we're not which i guess is a somewhat of a compliment
[2:18:26.680 --> 2:18:31.080]  they don't bother about things that are irrelevant but this is eric holder this
[2:18:31.080 --> 2:18:35.000]  is the first nomination out of the box if you will
[2:18:35.000 --> 2:18:38.520]  unconstitutional as it may be he still will be the nation's cheap
[2:18:38.520 --> 2:18:45.080]  law enforcement official and he will have at his
[2:18:45.080 --> 2:18:50.440]  control and his discretion the bureaucrat levers of power
[2:18:50.440 --> 2:18:56.040]  that will enable him to do what bush has been doing to manufacturers and owners
[2:18:56.040 --> 2:19:00.600]  and dealers and i suspect it'll even be more brazen
[2:19:00.600 --> 2:19:05.000]  more harmful more people in jail more innocent people in jail
[2:19:05.000 --> 2:19:08.840]  than even now this is going to be a very
[2:19:08.840 --> 2:19:12.840]  rough ride and i don't see the the republicans
[2:19:12.840 --> 2:19:18.280]  holding you have to have basically all 41 of them to
[2:19:18.280 --> 2:19:23.400]  make anything slow down in the senate and so far
[2:19:23.400 --> 2:19:28.600]  they haven't been doing very well at all in early votes on the obama
[2:19:28.600 --> 2:19:33.480]  agenda and you've got just enough that'll flake off that i think we're going
[2:19:33.480 --> 2:19:37.320]  to be in real trouble larry pratt of gun owners of america
[2:19:37.320 --> 2:19:39.880]  and when we come back i want to talk about that uh...
[2:19:39.880 --> 2:19:43.080]  district of columbia supreme court ruling because in the media it was
[2:19:43.080 --> 2:19:47.800]  champion as a win for gun owners all you can have guns in dc
[2:19:47.800 --> 2:19:51.320]  you only have to do all this to get it so he was all about regulation because
[2:19:51.320 --> 2:19:53.800]  like he said the true criminals don't get permits
[2:19:53.800 --> 2:20:00.840]  it's the alex joneshow info wars dot com and prison planet dot tv

[2:26:14.040 --> 2:26:17.720]  you'll be able or against him actually you'll be able to send an email
[2:26:17.720 --> 2:26:21.560]  to the senators telling them to put some backbone
[2:26:21.560 --> 2:26:26.760]  and oppose this guy we're in a desperate fight if he becomes the
[2:26:26.760 --> 2:26:29.960]  attorney general it's just one more sign that the republicans
[2:26:29.960 --> 2:26:33.240]  are not going to be of any help that they don't
[2:26:33.240 --> 2:26:36.360]  have it figured out yet that they have been
[2:26:36.360 --> 2:26:43.960]  so successively unsuccessful in the last elections several elections really
[2:26:43.960 --> 2:26:48.040]  because they have decided to become democrat
[2:26:48.040 --> 2:26:52.520]  light and you know the base doesn't want democrat
[2:26:52.520 --> 2:26:57.400]  real or democrat light they want something that's constitutional
[2:26:57.400 --> 2:27:02.440]  that stands up and opposes these guys and the republicans are still
[2:27:02.440 --> 2:27:05.320]  not by and large i mean their exceptions but
[2:27:05.320 --> 2:27:09.240]  most of them have not gotten the message
[2:27:09.240 --> 2:27:12.120]  yeah i don't think they're going to get the message either i mean uh...
[2:27:12.120 --> 2:27:16.120]  the two of them are called a stupid party for nothing
[2:27:16.120 --> 2:27:21.160]  well both parties at this point seem so amalgamated into one agenda
[2:27:21.160 --> 2:27:24.920]  i mean even even the debates are just you know
[2:27:24.920 --> 2:27:28.120]  they're milk toast you know it seems like they'll say
[2:27:28.120 --> 2:27:32.440]  the not only will they say one thing but you know the lean towards somebody but
[2:27:32.440 --> 2:27:34.600]  they don't actually take a real position saying hey
[2:27:34.600 --> 2:27:36.520]  this is what's going to happen when i'm in the presidency
[2:27:36.520 --> 2:27:40.200]  it's we'll see what we can do and of course you have the right to own a gun
[2:27:40.200 --> 2:27:42.840]  but then they don't tell you about all these regulations that are going to come
[2:27:42.840 --> 2:27:45.800]  with that so why don't you discuss that that dc
[2:27:45.800 --> 2:27:50.200]  um basically what you do you have to do to get a gun in dc now
[2:27:50.200 --> 2:27:53.960]  well first of all we can say that the heller decision did
[2:27:53.960 --> 2:27:57.800]  one thing that was particularly helpful it said that
[2:27:57.800 --> 2:28:01.640]  the second amendment does actually protect an individual right
[2:28:01.640 --> 2:28:05.000]  now we knew that all along the constitution said that
[2:28:05.000 --> 2:28:09.000]  all along but the importance of the supreme court
[2:28:09.000 --> 2:28:12.200]  saying that is that the lower courts have to
[2:28:12.200 --> 2:28:17.880]  deal with that if they don't that on its face becomes an appealable issue
[2:28:17.880 --> 2:28:23.560]  and makes it easier to get bad decisions at the lower federal court level
[2:28:23.560 --> 2:28:27.720]  brought to the supreme court that's going to be important because there's a
[2:28:27.720 --> 2:28:32.040]  lot of things that the heller decision did not touch on
[2:28:32.040 --> 2:28:35.640]  and it means that they're still up for grabs and there's going to be a lot of
[2:28:35.640 --> 2:28:39.480]  litigating between now and when the cows come home
[2:28:39.480 --> 2:28:43.560]  the heller decision said two things which were really the only two things in
[2:28:43.560 --> 2:28:48.040]  front of the court so in fairness which is kind of hard for me to
[2:28:48.040 --> 2:28:52.360]  do but in fairness to the court that's what they should have done was to just
[2:28:52.360 --> 2:28:55.960]  simply rule on those two things and they said and they came to the right
[2:28:55.960 --> 2:29:00.520]  conclusion on both it's unconstitutional to ban handguns
[2:29:00.520 --> 2:29:06.120]  and it is unconstitutional to require the encumbrance on
[2:29:06.120 --> 2:29:12.040]  other allowable guns the long guns that the district so graciously allows
[2:29:12.040 --> 2:29:16.120]  people to have had to be encumbered with a trigger lock
[2:29:16.120 --> 2:29:20.120]  and they had to be kept in a safe and if they were ever brought out
[2:29:20.120 --> 2:29:23.080]  and used for self-defense the way the law was written
[2:29:23.080 --> 2:29:27.080]  that would have been breaking the law yeah it just seems so
[2:29:27.080 --> 2:29:30.360]  ridiculous that i'm supposed to keep my gun in a safe if there's something
[2:29:30.360 --> 2:29:35.240]  going on in my house oh my god i mean i might have to reach for it

[2:32:21.640 --> 2:32:25.320]  the new president would be forced by an international incident

[2:32:33.640 --> 2:32:38.040]  presidential decisions will likely affect restriction of transportation

[2:33:53.160 --> 2:33:56.040]  start to think for themselves they do question things
[2:33:56.040 --> 2:33:59.800]  and uh that's what we need now more than ever when we have a president coming
[2:33:59.800 --> 2:34:03.480]  into office that expects sacrifice and service when you have rama
[2:34:03.480 --> 2:34:07.080]  manuel coming in saying that he is for mandatory
[2:34:07.080 --> 2:34:11.240]  conscription of 18 to 25 year olds and now you have this new book being
[2:34:11.240 --> 2:34:15.240]  published called grits uh this guy's been on the trail now for
[2:34:15.240 --> 2:34:18.600]  two plus years talking about conscription tom blankley at the washington
[2:34:18.600 --> 2:34:21.960]  times and it's all about programming you to be for it
[2:34:21.960 --> 2:34:25.800]  and uh i'm worried about it a lot of people are behind obama
[2:34:25.800 --> 2:34:29.640]  and like i said especially when i'm in new york and i'm going through the mall
[2:34:29.640 --> 2:34:35.000]  and i just see shirt after shirt and hat after hat of obama or yes we can and
[2:34:35.000 --> 2:34:38.120]  these aren't election shirts these are like fashionable
[2:34:38.120 --> 2:34:43.000]  like hip-hop style jackets shirts like 35 dollar hats
[2:34:43.000 --> 2:34:46.520]  you know the culture is being brainwashed all right let's uh
[2:34:46.520 --> 2:34:49.960]  let's go to uh go back to larry proud of gun owners of america
[2:34:49.960 --> 2:34:52.680]  uh larry wanting to tell people how they get this information what's the
[2:34:52.680 --> 2:34:55.320]  website and the number and then i'd like you to tell me
[2:34:55.320 --> 2:34:59.960]  why is it so hard for you know a new yorker to get a carry and conceal permit
[2:34:59.960 --> 2:35:03.880]  as opposed to these other states i mean i've often wondered why it is that
[2:35:03.880 --> 2:35:07.560]  you know my buddy who was in the national guard couldn't get a uh
[2:35:07.560 --> 2:35:11.080]  carry and conceal permit once he got back for my rack
[2:35:11.080 --> 2:35:14.840]  well gunowners.org is where you're going to find the
[2:35:14.840 --> 2:35:18.920]  information about what we're up to at the federal level the congressional
[2:35:18.920 --> 2:35:22.840]  lobbying that we're doing particularly to draw people's attention to the
[2:35:22.840 --> 2:35:28.760]  alerts that we uh keep a log of the current ones right there on the home
[2:35:28.760 --> 2:35:32.360]  page so when you go to gunowners.org you'll be able to see
[2:35:32.360 --> 2:35:35.960]  the things that we're working on the things of concern and what people can do
[2:35:35.960 --> 2:35:39.480]  about it with a few easy clicks sending off email
[2:35:39.480 --> 2:35:43.320]  to their senators their representatives whatever is the appropriate
[2:35:43.320 --> 2:35:48.280]  recipient here in washington in new york you had something that
[2:35:48.280 --> 2:35:52.760]  went on the books relatively early in this country a sullivan act
[2:35:52.760 --> 2:35:56.760]  has a in my mind it has a rather ironic history
[2:35:56.760 --> 2:36:04.040]  the uh name sullivan uh might suggest correctly that the uh namesake is
[2:36:04.040 --> 2:36:07.400]  irish it was an irish state senator sullivan
[2:36:07.400 --> 2:36:10.520]  who was impotuned by some of his criminal
[2:36:10.520 --> 2:36:16.840]  constituents the irish mafia as it were uh that they didn't like the influx of
[2:36:16.840 --> 2:36:21.560]  these italian mafia coming in from southern europe
[2:36:21.560 --> 2:36:25.480]  and they were basically hitting on the turf
[2:36:25.480 --> 2:36:29.160]  of the fellas that were already there and they didn't like it
[2:36:29.160 --> 2:36:34.440]  and so they uh in the name of crime control
[2:36:34.440 --> 2:36:37.880]  the uh the constant handmaiden of these
[2:36:37.880 --> 2:36:41.720]  scalaway politicians in the name of crime control they enacted the sullivan
[2:36:41.720 --> 2:36:45.560]  act targeting basically even though the language was general
[2:36:45.560 --> 2:36:50.520]  targeting these italian mafia that needed to be controlled
[2:36:50.520 --> 2:36:53.880]  well it shows that even crooks can be stupid here they are
[2:36:53.880 --> 2:36:58.040]  willing to break the law six waves from sunday and they assume
[2:36:58.040 --> 2:37:01.960]  that a gun control law is going to disarm their opponents
[2:37:01.960 --> 2:37:06.520]  but when the politicians worded it naturally they worded it as a general
[2:37:06.520 --> 2:37:11.000]  matter so that persons and people and citizens of new york so forth
[2:37:11.000 --> 2:37:16.440]  were the targets and the initial impetus behind the law
[2:37:16.440 --> 2:37:22.120]  has been long forgotten and instead of the italian mafia being the target now
[2:37:22.120 --> 2:37:26.680]  it's the free citizenry being the target which is the way
[2:37:26.680 --> 2:37:31.320]  politicians really like it and there just hasn't been the horsepower to
[2:37:31.320 --> 2:37:37.480]  back it off we had a uh the you can find similar laws in other states that
[2:37:37.480 --> 2:37:42.200]  have actually been pushed back at virginia
[2:37:42.200 --> 2:37:48.280]  had one that for years um was being applied in a very arbitrary fashion
[2:37:48.280 --> 2:37:53.000]  by local judges and even though for instance oliver north was able to show
[2:37:53.000 --> 2:37:58.440]  that terrorist abu nidal actually had a contract out on his life
[2:37:58.440 --> 2:38:03.640]  the courts decided oh right before an election that he was running for senate
[2:38:03.640 --> 2:38:08.840]  you might say that um he wasn't a person of good enough character to be able to
[2:38:08.840 --> 2:38:13.320]  get a concealed carry permit well after that fiasco
[2:38:13.320 --> 2:38:17.720]  we got then state senator virgil gudu later went on to serve
[2:38:17.720 --> 2:38:21.080]  with distinction in the u.s. house of representatives to
[2:38:21.080 --> 2:38:25.480]  change the concealed carry law so that discretion was taken away from these
[2:38:25.480 --> 2:38:29.320]  judges that's something that needs to be done and would help enormously
[2:38:29.320 --> 2:38:34.920]  in new york if you just made it into the kind of law you have in virginia
[2:38:34.920 --> 2:38:38.760]  it wouldn't be quite as good for other reasons but it would help enormously
[2:38:38.760 --> 2:38:43.560]  if you go in you make your application they can't prove that you're a crook
[2:38:43.560 --> 2:38:46.840]  or you know some other disqualified person they gotta
[2:38:46.840 --> 2:38:50.920]  give you the permit and that's what we did to take it away from
[2:38:50.920 --> 2:38:55.800]  the judges in virginia we've just never been able to do that
[2:38:55.800 --> 2:38:59.080]  in new york yeah new york's a tough one
[2:38:59.080 --> 2:39:02.600]  larry in the next 90 seconds why don't you tell you know gun owners out there
[2:39:02.600 --> 2:39:05.880]  people who are pro second amendment what they can do today
[2:39:05.880 --> 2:39:09.720]  to help ensure their gun rights for the future well i think it's important that
[2:39:09.720 --> 2:39:14.520]  the people not stop speaking out if the politicians think
[2:39:14.520 --> 2:39:17.720]  we've gone away they're going to just be all the more
[2:39:17.720 --> 2:39:24.120]  unaccountable and unconcerned about the opinion of folks back home
[2:39:24.120 --> 2:39:29.720]  there's been a reluctant so far on the part of democrats
[2:39:29.720 --> 2:39:35.320]  in particular to initiate anti-gun legislation unless they can get the nra
[2:39:35.320 --> 2:39:39.480]  to support it thus baptizing it making it respectable
[2:39:39.480 --> 2:39:43.480]  not even really gun control as long as it has that kind of
[2:39:43.480 --> 2:39:48.440]  across the spectrum support and we've got to make enough noise that no matter
[2:39:48.440 --> 2:39:52.920]  what the nra does the politicians will understand
[2:39:52.920 --> 2:39:57.400]  that they're still playing with fire the same fire that burned them
[2:39:57.400 --> 2:40:01.560]  in 1994 when the democrats lost control of the congress
[2:40:01.560 --> 2:40:05.960]  over the gun issue and when al gore lost the presidency
[2:40:05.960 --> 2:40:10.360]  over the gun issue now the republicans need to hear from
[2:40:10.360 --> 2:40:14.120]  folks at home as much as the democrats because the republicans have never
[2:40:14.120 --> 2:40:17.800]  figured out that if it's if it hurts their opponents then
[2:40:17.800 --> 2:40:20.840]  it would benefit republicans to make their opponents
[2:40:20.840 --> 2:40:25.720]  vote on it that's something that is going to be harder in this congress because
[2:40:25.720 --> 2:40:29.080]  the rules are not favorable and they're not changing them
[2:40:29.080 --> 2:40:32.840]  in our favor but nevertheless the republicans
[2:40:32.840 --> 2:40:37.640]  need to hear from folks who don't agree with what they're i mean
[2:40:37.640 --> 2:40:41.480]  oren hatch right now is the guy that's selling out
[2:40:41.480 --> 2:40:47.400]  the cause on trying to fight eric holder's nomination as attorney general
[2:40:47.400 --> 2:40:52.600]  oren hatch has already broken ranks with the small republican caucus
[2:40:52.600 --> 2:40:55.800]  and if we don't have his vote we won't be able to
[2:40:55.800 --> 2:41:00.360]  like unless we can get a democrat from somewhere mount an opposition
[2:41:00.360 --> 2:41:04.200]  to eric holder through a filibuster threat
[2:41:04.200 --> 2:41:07.800]  thank you very much oren hatch the quote conservative
[2:41:07.800 --> 2:41:13.320]  from utah well larry it's a politics as usual in my mind they say one thing and

[2:45:57.160 --> 2:46:08.160]  Rock runs out
[2:46:08.160 --> 2:46:11.160]  The light that is not light is here
[2:46:11.160 --> 2:46:14.160]  To crush you out with your own fear
[2:46:14.160 --> 2:46:17.160]  You hide, you hide, that will be found
[2:46:17.160 --> 2:46:20.160]  Release your grip without a sound

[2:48:30.160 --> 2:48:57.160]  Hunt
[2:48:57.160 --> 2:49:25.160]  Hunt
[2:49:25.160 --> 2:49:28.160]  Then you crawl back in
[2:49:28.160 --> 2:49:30.160]  Into your obsession
[2:49:30.160 --> 2:49:33.160]  Never do return
[2:49:33.160 --> 2:49:37.160]  This is your confession
[2:49:37.160 --> 2:49:40.160]  Hunt you down with adversity

[2:49:51.160 --> 2:49:54.160]  Hunt you down or not may long
[2:49:54.160 --> 2:49:59.160]  Look, rust, I can crawl out again
[2:49:59.160 --> 2:50:02.160]  But your luck runs out
[2:50:02.160 --> 2:50:31.160]  Your luck runs out
[2:50:32.160 --> 2:51:01.160]  Alright folks, we're going to be back after this with the ChemTrail news portion of that. Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv
[2:51:01.160 --> 2:51:04.160]  Break the law and you're caught on film.
[2:51:04.160 --> 2:51:09.160]  Practically impossible for police to spot plates that have been treated with a reflective spray.
[2:51:09.160 --> 2:51:11.160]  The reflection blinded our camera.
[2:51:11.160 --> 2:51:16.160]  We are under the microscope. Red light cameras and speed cameras are in place to make money, not for your safety.
[2:51:16.160 --> 2:51:20.160]  But you don't have to be defenseless against these unconstitutional devices.
[2:51:20.160 --> 2:51:23.160]  Have a fighting chance with sprayyourplate.com's photo blocker.
[2:51:23.160 --> 2:51:29.160]  When properly applied, this revolutionary product has proven itself to be the most effective device available against traffic cameras.
[2:51:29.160 --> 2:51:35.160]  Invisible to the naked eye, your license plate when flashed will be overexposed and unreadable to the cameras.
[2:51:35.160 --> 2:51:37.160]  Save your money. Go to sprayyourplate.com.
[2:51:37.160 --> 2:51:45.160]  That's sprayyourplate.com and check out the newscast showing the photo blocker in action, proving that the sprayyour plate's photo blocker works against traffic cameras.
[2:51:45.160 --> 2:51:51.160]  Go to sprayyourplate.com or call 1-800-276-9601.
[2:51:51.160 --> 2:51:55.160]  That's 1-800-276-9601.
[2:51:55.160 --> 2:52:00.160]  Don't give your money to the state. Spray your plate. And when the cameras flashed, you'll save some cash.
[2:52:00.160 --> 2:52:07.160]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[2:52:07.160 --> 2:52:11.160]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[2:52:11.160 --> 2:52:13.160]  Bin Laden. This is his MO.
[2:52:13.160 --> 2:52:16.160]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[2:52:16.160 --> 2:52:24.160]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[2:52:24.160 --> 2:52:31.160]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[2:52:31.160 --> 2:52:35.160]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:52:35.160 --> 2:52:45.160]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[2:52:45.160 --> 2:52:49.160]  Fabled Enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com.
[2:52:49.160 --> 2:52:54.160]  You'll see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:52:54.160 --> 2:53:20.160]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[2:53:20.160 --> 2:53:27.160]  Tomorrow may be too late.
[2:53:50.160 --> 2:53:53.160]  The government not allow this crop to grow in the U.S.
[2:53:53.160 --> 2:54:22.160]  This product is also great for pets and animals. Call 908-6912608 or go to hempusa.org today.
[2:54:22.160 --> 2:54:27.160]  The very, very end of that horror show, but if you saw it at the very end, you're on prisonplanet.tv.
[2:54:27.160 --> 2:54:35.160]  You saw them put up the chemtrails, and the chemtrails is what killed the larger part of the zombie population, because it had chromium and barium in it.
[2:54:35.160 --> 2:54:40.160]  But now, at the very end, they're going to play actual news reports. Listen.
[2:54:40.160 --> 2:55:08.160]  Bring it back, guys.
[2:55:08.160 --> 2:55:11.160]  Proving the source is a whole other matter.
[2:55:11.160 --> 2:55:17.160]  Well, who else would be able to have planes in U.S. airspace other than the United States government spraying chemicals?
[2:55:17.160 --> 2:55:25.160]  And again, they spin it as to the arsenic and the barium in there are basically to thwart a Russian plot to zombify America.
[2:55:25.160 --> 2:55:37.160]  I don't care for that spin. I don't like that spin, but there's a really crazy music video from the Tunguska event to Russian eugenics to chemtrails all being intertwined.
[2:55:37.160 --> 2:55:39.160]  I encourage people to check that out.
[2:55:39.160 --> 2:55:42.160]  We got a few minutes for calls. I know a lot of people have been holding.
[2:55:42.160 --> 2:55:48.160]  And then we're going to go to Jonas Stolzfitz in the top of the hour, and then after 30 after, we're going to have Maurice Thompson.
[2:55:48.160 --> 2:55:52.160]  We'll take your calls again at the bottom of the last hour.
[2:55:52.160 --> 2:55:57.160]  Let's go to Bob in California. Bob, what's on your mind?
[2:55:57.160 --> 2:56:01.160]  Yeah, how you doing? I was actually calling for a question for Larry. I don't know if he's still on.
[2:56:01.160 --> 2:56:05.160]  He's not, but maybe the next time we get him, what was your question for him?
[2:56:05.160 --> 2:56:09.160]  The question was actually, I wanted to know his opinion of Appleseed Rackle clinics.
[2:56:09.160 --> 2:56:19.160]  And because the Dungculture is so divided, I was going to ask if they're doing any cross-pollinating with other organizations such as Appleseed or any others to try to come up with a unified front.
[2:56:19.160 --> 2:56:26.160]  Well, I would throw him an email. I'm not quite sure. I know Alex plans on having him on again when he gets back, so hopefully we can answer that question then.
[2:56:26.160 --> 2:56:30.160]  Let's jump to Robert in Texas. Robert, what's on your mind?
[2:56:30.160 --> 2:56:31.160]  Jason.
[2:56:31.160 --> 2:56:32.160]  Yes.
[2:56:32.160 --> 2:56:34.160]  Great to talk to you. First time caller.
[2:56:34.160 --> 2:56:41.160]  I called with a question for Mr. Pratt, but I'll just go ahead and put the issue out there.
[2:56:41.160 --> 2:56:52.160]  15 years ago, here in Texas, I was felonized for a DWI, and according to the Penal Code of the State of Texas,
[2:56:52.160 --> 2:57:01.160]  five years after I have done my time, whether it was in prison or completed parole, I'm allowed to own firearms again.
[2:57:01.160 --> 2:57:09.160]  But, of course, federal law says that for the rest of my life, I am to be defenseless.
[2:57:09.160 --> 2:57:20.160]  So what I was going to ask Mr. Pratt, and I guess I just put out there, is I wonder if there's any organization out there at this time, as far as a Second Amendment organization,
[2:57:20.160 --> 2:57:32.160]  who is pursuing that legally because, you know, with the heller decision, and I know they threw the felon thing in there, but they said that the Second Amendment was a God-given right,
[2:57:32.160 --> 2:57:39.160]  the same as freedom of religion or freedom of expression. So, you know, if that's the case, how can they take it away from me?
[2:57:39.160 --> 2:57:44.160]  That's a great question. You know what? I would say go to Gun Owners of America, send them an email.
[2:57:44.160 --> 2:57:50.160]  Larry Pratt is a lot more prevalent than me with his gun owner knowledge.
[2:57:50.160 --> 2:57:55.160]  You know, being a Second Amendment advocate, you know, I really, that's about all I know. I don't really handle a gun.
[2:57:55.160 --> 2:58:04.160]  I got a.22 in my house that's my roommates and he's a hunter. That's why we have that there, you know, it's deer season, not so long ago.
[2:58:04.160 --> 2:58:10.160]  I wish I knew a little bit more. All right, let's go to Brandon in Canada. Brandon, what's on your mind?
[2:58:10.160 --> 2:58:15.160]  How are you doing, Jason? Good. Quickly, Brandon, we've got about 30 seconds.
[2:58:15.160 --> 2:58:22.160]  Okay, you want to put me back on hold then? I can't. You know what? I will put you on hold. We'll take your call at the top of the hour.
[2:58:22.160 --> 2:58:30.160]  Then we'll go to Jonas Stolzfitz and Maurice Thompson. That's right, they're SWAT teaming people who are trying to sell you healthy milk.
[2:58:30.160 --> 2:58:41.160]  Imagine that. We're just going to take it, put it under government control, cut out the small farmer, infowars.com, prisonplanet.com.

[3:00:15.160 --> 3:00:20.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back at what we're going to, Jonas Stoltzfitz, in a moment.
[3:00:20.160 --> 3:00:34.160]  Back in May, the feds launched a, this is not for the world, not daily, by the way, Gestapo Raid over raw milk they went in and took $30,000 worth of milk, cheese, and other butter.
[3:00:34.160 --> 3:00:40.160]  I mean, basically they took this guy's farm away from him. They took his product away, they took his way of life away.
[3:00:40.160 --> 3:00:49.160]  And since then, Jonas and Judy Stoltzfitz have started the Pennsylvania Independent Consumer and Farmers Association.
[3:00:49.160 --> 3:00:55.160]  In a direct response to that, it's just a crazy undercover sting. We'll get to him in one moment.
[3:00:55.160 --> 3:00:58.160]  Brandon, you called in. What do you want to talk about?
[3:00:58.160 --> 3:01:11.160]  Well, I just want to know, what is the majority of Americans going to do when the Constitution's put on hold? Like, I know up here in Canada, or more on of a Prime Minister, just paroled Parliament until like the 26th of January.
[3:01:11.160 --> 3:01:16.160]  Basically, he's got veto power. You can do whatever you want between now and then, sign any agreements.
[3:01:16.160 --> 3:01:21.160]  And it wouldn't be, you know, privy to the people because well, Parliament's not in session.
[3:01:21.160 --> 3:01:28.160]  So I just want to know, when the massive crisis happens, what's the majority of the people going to do? Are they going to stand up and fight when these government terrorists come kick in your door?
[3:01:28.160 --> 3:01:34.160]  Or what? I don't know. I mean, I expect a lot of them to lay down, to be honest with you, Brandon.
[3:01:34.160 --> 3:01:50.160]  Have you seen that guy, J.J. Johnson? He was on C-SPAN. He was from Ohio. They kept calling him a Nazi because he was a black man and he was like stainless and we're starting to build like not compounds, but the people in the communities are like arming themselves.
[3:01:50.160 --> 3:01:55.160]  So they protect themselves because they have rights. And they're not going to lie down and die for this.
[3:01:55.160 --> 3:02:01.160]  They demonized the militia movement back when they blamed Timothy McVeigh for Oklahoma City.
[3:02:01.160 --> 3:02:02.160]  And Waco and...
[3:02:02.160 --> 3:02:07.160]  Yes, well, exactly. And they demonized communes with Waco and they went in there and killed a bunch of people.
[3:02:07.160 --> 3:02:17.160]  They've been doing it for a long time, Brandon. Unfortunately, they do have the public mindset against the Second Amendment, against militias, against communes.
[3:02:17.160 --> 3:02:25.160]  They made David Koreshin, by the way, I'm no Koresh fan, into him being a religious, not into an excuse to kill a bunch of women and children.
[3:02:25.160 --> 3:02:30.160]  So I don't expect much of an opposition from the American people. I thank you for the call.
[3:02:30.160 --> 3:02:35.160]  All right, with that said, we have Jonas Stolzfuss on the line. I hope I'm pronouncing that right.
[3:02:35.160 --> 3:02:44.160]  Out of the Pennsylvania Independent Consumers and Farmers Association, and they started this group really right after this raid in May.
[3:02:44.160 --> 3:02:47.160]  Why don't you just give us some background on this raid, Jonas?
[3:02:47.160 --> 3:02:53.160]  Well, some background. Actually, Alex, it was three raids altogether.
[3:02:53.160 --> 3:02:56.160]  One happened, give or take August.
[3:02:56.160 --> 3:03:01.160]  $20,000 or so of stuff that equipment was taken.
[3:03:01.160 --> 3:03:17.160]  Another, the next spring, again, about $20,000, $25,000 of the stuff was taken. And the third one then, after an undercover agent by the name of Kirk, that's K-I-R-K from the Carlisle State Police Barrack,
[3:03:17.160 --> 3:03:34.160]  went into Mark North's farm and went in with an old beat-up pickup truck, and the parents were in home, and so he talked to the children, young man, and used my name saying that he said,
[3:03:34.160 --> 3:03:41.160]  I'm new in the area, and Jonas and Judy said that this would be a good place for me to buy raw milk.
[3:03:41.160 --> 3:03:52.160]  Now, there was a witness to this whole thing, and he settled for two gallons of raw milk after giving his stop story about being new in the area and knowing me,
[3:03:52.160 --> 3:04:02.160]  and when he left the site, he said, say hello to Jonas for me, and promptly took the milk to the PDA.
[3:04:02.160 --> 3:04:11.160]  They confirmed, yes, it was raw milk, and they promptly, within very, very few days, came and raided him again.
[3:04:11.160 --> 3:04:14.160]  This time they got $10,000 worth of stuff from him.
[3:04:14.160 --> 3:04:30.160]  So we have an ongoing case of harassment and persecution of, here's a farmer with 10 children working hard, making the living, making stuff that people want to buy.
[3:04:30.160 --> 3:04:36.160]  People of their own free will come down his driveway and pay him good money for this stuff.
[3:04:36.160 --> 3:04:42.160]  He can make a living, but the state thinks that he has that permission.
[3:04:42.160 --> 3:04:50.160]  The state wants to regulate not only what we do in our lives, but what we put in our bodies, and that's what this is all about.
[3:04:50.160 --> 3:05:01.160]  We'll be back after this, it's the Alex Jones Show, I am Jason Bermas, Infowars.com.

[3:06:02.160 --> 3:06:09.160]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[3:06:09.160 --> 3:06:13.160]  The enemy struck America on September 11th, but who is the enemy?
[3:06:13.160 --> 3:06:14.160]  Bin Laden.
[3:06:14.160 --> 3:06:15.160]  This is his M.O.'s.
[3:06:15.160 --> 3:06:18.160]  Welcome to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[3:06:18.160 --> 3:06:25.160]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[3:06:25.160 --> 3:06:32.160]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[3:06:32.160 --> 3:06:36.160]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:06:36.160 --> 3:06:44.160]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games,
[3:06:44.160 --> 3:06:46.160]  government, and much, much more.
[3:06:46.160 --> 3:06:47.160]  Fabled Enemies.

[3:08:22.160 --> 3:08:27.160]  Look, I've got to give another disclaimer, I guess, for this Metallica video I just played.
[3:08:27.160 --> 3:08:33.160]  I played it for the prisonplanet.tv audience because it covers eugenics, it covers chemtrails.
[3:08:33.160 --> 3:08:41.160]  For a platinum-selling artist to cover these issues and to play actual news clips at the end of their music video is newsworthy.
[3:08:41.160 --> 3:08:46.160]  So all you listeners out there that think this has turned into some kind of hard rock metal show, it hasn't.
[3:08:46.160 --> 3:08:51.160]  We played one song in four hours, I apologize to anybody we offended.
[3:08:51.160 --> 3:08:53.160]  Alright, let's get on to bigger and better topics.
[3:08:53.160 --> 3:08:58.160]  The fact that the federal government is trying to regulate what we can eat and put into our bodies,
[3:08:58.160 --> 3:09:04.160]  and they're going after all these organic farmers, they want us to eat these GMO foods that are full of poison
[3:09:04.160 --> 3:09:08.160]  and they want to put the small-time farmer out of business in general.
[3:09:08.160 --> 3:09:13.160]  If they can't control them with their surplus farming and having them destroy their corn crop,
[3:09:13.160 --> 3:09:20.160]  then they have no use for them and that's why we've seen just really a demise in this country of the family farm.
[3:09:20.160 --> 3:09:24.160]  I live in upstate New York and more and more people every month have to give up their family farm.
[3:09:24.160 --> 3:09:26.160]  It's pretty crazy to me, Jonas.
[3:09:26.160 --> 3:09:30.160]  It's really bad. Did you know about the Sharon Palmer case?
[3:09:30.160 --> 3:09:32.160]  No, please enlighten us.
[3:09:32.160 --> 3:09:40.160]  Sharon Palmer, single mom, California goat farmer, makes goat cheese for sale in the farmer's market.
[3:09:40.160 --> 3:09:45.160]  She has both children, I think it was December 18th, an undercover agent.
[3:09:45.160 --> 3:09:47.160]  Here's another case of undercover agent.
[3:09:47.160 --> 3:09:54.160]  Come into her farm that she had just moved to from her location and begged her to buy cheese from her.
[3:09:54.160 --> 3:09:57.160]  Oh, she said, I can't sell cheese. You'll have to go to the farmer's market to buy it,
[3:09:57.160 --> 3:09:59.160]  because I can't sell it here at the farm.
[3:09:59.160 --> 3:10:02.160]  Well, maybe I'll get to the cheese. I'll forget.
[3:10:02.160 --> 3:10:06.160]  Talked her into it, finally said, okay, I'll give you some cheese.
[3:10:06.160 --> 3:10:12.160]  So she gave the person some cheese, the undercover agent left, Sharon left a few minutes later,
[3:10:12.160 --> 3:10:16.160]  went down the road and very shortly was arrested and brought back to the farm,
[3:10:16.160 --> 3:10:22.160]  only discovered she was swarmed with undercover agents and enforcement agencies,
[3:10:22.160 --> 3:10:24.160]  which went over her farm to check it out.
[3:10:24.160 --> 3:10:26.160]  Meanwhile, they handcuffed this woman.
[3:10:26.160 --> 3:10:33.160]  Did you get that handcuffed her like a criminal druggy and threw her back in the back of their car?
[3:10:33.160 --> 3:10:37.160]  A creased cruiser, then took her in, kept her overnight.
[3:10:37.160 --> 3:10:42.160]  The children were parted off to relatives while the goats were left to fend for themselves,
[3:10:42.160 --> 3:10:45.160]  kept her overnight, all right, in jail. For what?
[3:10:45.160 --> 3:10:49.160]  Selling cocaine? No. Selling goat cheese.
[3:10:49.160 --> 3:10:54.160]  Did you get that food? We got something really wrong here.
[3:10:54.160 --> 3:10:59.160]  The fact that our undercover agents are spending time on this,
[3:10:59.160 --> 3:11:03.160]  it's not like anybody's complaining that they're getting sick from the food.
[3:11:03.160 --> 3:11:06.160]  The food is probably the healthiest food that you can get.
[3:11:06.160 --> 3:11:12.160]  It doesn't go through all these processes where they put all these nasty preservatives.
[3:11:12.160 --> 3:11:18.160]  You can't even pronounce half the things that are in your food now.
[3:11:18.160 --> 3:11:23.160]  Even when you're buying produce, when you're buying beef or chicken,
[3:11:23.160 --> 3:11:28.160]  a lot of that meat is now cloned when you go to Walmart or Price Chopper or these bigger chains.
[3:11:28.160 --> 3:11:30.160]  Your best bet is to go to these farmers market,
[3:11:30.160 --> 3:11:33.160]  and now the government is trying to regulate that so it's impossible.
[3:11:33.160 --> 3:11:44.160]  It's really bad. The story on this Sharon Palmer case can be picked up at thecompletepatient.com, if anyone's interested.
[3:11:44.160 --> 3:11:48.160]  Very, very, a lot of details are interesting.
[3:11:48.160 --> 3:11:54.160]  Mark McCaffey made a comment on that case.
[3:11:54.160 --> 3:11:58.160]  He said, this is totally, totally, totally ridiculous.
[3:11:58.160 --> 3:12:02.160]  What we have here is tyrants posing as police officers.
[3:12:02.160 --> 3:12:06.160]  We have people who have no conscience posing as police officers.
[3:12:06.160 --> 3:12:08.160]  It's really, really bad.
[3:12:08.160 --> 3:12:16.160]  It's like we are descending in some locations into like a Gestapo Nazi Germany situation.
[3:12:16.160 --> 3:12:19.160]  It's really bad.
[3:12:19.160 --> 3:12:26.160]  A lot of people can't even think that way because they honestly believe in this new president, hope and change.
[3:12:26.160 --> 3:12:32.160]  It's been all over the television, but they don't realize that, for instance, a few months back,
[3:12:32.160 --> 3:12:37.160]  a teacher got in trouble because he created his own Obama Youth Corps of young African-American men.
[3:12:37.160 --> 3:12:39.160]  Just bring it up yourself.
[3:12:39.160 --> 3:12:44.160]  He's got them chanting Alpha Omega, and I'm going to do this for Obama.
[3:12:44.160 --> 3:12:47.160]  They don't see that. That's like a Nazi youth.
[3:12:47.160 --> 3:12:52.160]  Obama gave his global citizenship speech in Berlin, Germany.
[3:12:52.160 --> 3:12:54.160]  This guy is a front for the globalists.
[3:12:54.160 --> 3:12:56.160]  I think you're going to see not only regulation of food everywhere,
[3:12:56.160 --> 3:13:01.160]  but you're just going to see a massive regulation of everything from our economic system to,
[3:13:01.160 --> 3:13:04.160]  I mean, possibly our roadways and our toll roads.
[3:13:04.160 --> 3:13:07.160]  I mean, they're talking about a new, new deal.
[3:13:07.160 --> 3:13:09.160]  This is something that was done in the Great Depression,
[3:13:09.160 --> 3:13:11.160]  or to bring us out of the Great Depression by Roosevelt,
[3:13:11.160 --> 3:13:15.160]  and now the news is prepping us that we're in this other Great Depression.
[3:13:15.160 --> 3:13:20.160]  I think in a Great Depression, when people are going to have a hard time making money
[3:13:20.160 --> 3:13:24.160]  and buying food that you'd want a lot of farms in this country to provide that food for people,
[3:13:24.160 --> 3:13:28.160]  but no, the government would rather regulate it and ship in poison for us.
[3:13:28.160 --> 3:13:30.160]  Why is that?
[3:13:30.160 --> 3:13:36.160]  It's unconscionable. I don't understand it, but we can fight back.
[3:13:36.160 --> 3:13:37.160]  We can fight back.
[3:13:37.160 --> 3:13:41.160]  There is an organization called Farm to Consumer Legal Defense Fund
[3:13:41.160 --> 3:13:47.160]  that is defending Sharon Palmer, this organization along with the Buckeye Institute
[3:13:47.160 --> 3:13:51.160]  is defending the Stovers in Ohio, and they can use help.
[3:13:51.160 --> 3:13:54.160]  If anyone has a buck or two, they can send to these places.
[3:13:54.160 --> 3:13:56.160]  They can use help because we have to fight back.
[3:13:56.160 --> 3:13:58.160]  We've got to push the government back in this thing.
[3:13:58.160 --> 3:14:00.160]  We've got to push the government back.
[3:14:00.160 --> 3:14:04.160]  And why don't you give out some websites and phone numbers, how people can help,
[3:14:04.160 --> 3:14:06.160]  because now is the time.
[3:14:06.160 --> 3:14:08.160]  It's not to wait six months from now when it gets worse.
[3:14:08.160 --> 3:14:12.160]  It's already as bad as it could possibly get when, again, you have undercover agents
[3:14:12.160 --> 3:14:15.160]  going to small Mennonite farms.
[3:14:15.160 --> 3:14:17.160]  I have a large Amish community where I am.
[3:14:17.160 --> 3:14:20.160]  I still go to the farmers market, even where I live,
[3:14:20.160 --> 3:14:23.160]  which is about an hour away from where the Amish farmers market is.
[3:14:23.160 --> 3:14:27.160]  We have a farmers market every week, and you can go get fresh produce.
[3:14:27.160 --> 3:14:31.160]  That might not be around six months or a year from now.
[3:14:31.160 --> 3:14:41.160]  The primary agency that's fighting against the government on this is the Farmer to Consumer Legal Defense Fund.
[3:14:41.160 --> 3:14:46.160]  You can Google that, find out where to send some money to help them out.
[3:14:46.160 --> 3:14:51.160]  And we need to contact farmers on where to buy stuff.
[3:14:51.160 --> 3:14:55.160]  And there's national organizations, localharvest.com.
[3:14:55.160 --> 3:15:03.160]  It's a clearinghouse for farmers to advertise their stuff on, realmilk.com.
[3:15:03.160 --> 3:15:08.160]  Clearinghouse for finding where to get good stuff, good raw milk.
[3:15:08.160 --> 3:15:13.160]  Information about our PICFA organization is info at PICFA.org.
[3:15:13.160 --> 3:15:17.160]  That's the Pennsylvania Independent Consumers and Farmers Association.
[3:15:17.160 --> 3:15:24.160]  We are battling to get the government out of the consumer to farm a relationship.
[3:15:24.160 --> 3:15:29.160]  If I can sell you a tomato or a carrot, I can sell you a quarter of milk.
[3:15:29.160 --> 3:15:31.160]  It's my right as a farmer.
[3:15:31.160 --> 3:15:35.160]  If I want to buy it from a farmer, it is my right to go him to buy.
[3:15:35.160 --> 3:15:42.160]  This thing will happen to have permission to do what we've been doing for 10,000 years is totally unconscionable.
[3:15:42.160 --> 3:15:45.160]  Well, it shows the expansion of control.
[3:15:45.160 --> 3:15:48.160]  It shows that they're never, ever, ever satisfied.
[3:15:48.160 --> 3:15:51.160]  They're not even satisfied with selling the majority of the public poison.
[3:15:51.160 --> 3:15:54.160]  They will now want to sell all of the public poison.
[3:15:54.160 --> 3:16:00.160]  Why don't you just talk to some of the dangers of these GMO foods and why you should actually go to a farmer's market?
[3:16:00.160 --> 3:16:04.160]  Why you should buy fresh milk and produce from your local farmer?
[3:16:04.160 --> 3:16:14.160]  Well, the GMO things and the stuff that Monsanto has been passing off on the farmers to inject into their cows to give more milk at the BHT.
[3:16:14.160 --> 3:16:22.160]  Those things are so, so many unknowns. There is one known thing about the BHT and that is 10% more women.
[3:16:22.160 --> 3:16:26.160]  A woman has at least a 10% higher possibility of getting breast cancer.
[3:16:26.160 --> 3:16:31.160]  She drinks milk as in where the cows have been injected with this Monsanto growth hormone.
[3:16:31.160 --> 3:16:35.160]  And there are very, very clear evidence.
[3:16:35.160 --> 3:16:43.160]  There's very clear evidence that the roundup that comes through the grains and the product that are sprayed with this stuff
[3:16:43.160 --> 3:16:51.160]  comes right on through the finished product and the poison in the roundup comes right on through and affects the people who eat it.
[3:16:51.160 --> 3:16:55.160]  The problem with this is most people are not aware of it.
[3:16:55.160 --> 3:17:02.160]  They just start not aware of it because the news media is squelching information, getting back to the BHT.
[3:17:02.160 --> 3:17:12.160]  About a year ago, there's two really good journalists on Fox News put together a documentary on this BHT
[3:17:12.160 --> 3:17:19.160]  and they were forced to change it, forced to change it, forced to change it because Monsanto was a big advertiser on Fox.
[3:17:19.160 --> 3:17:24.160]  Well, they ended up losing their job. Never to get the thing published, Monsanto controlled the airway.
[3:17:24.160 --> 3:17:26.160]  And that's on the way. Which documentary is that?
[3:17:26.160 --> 3:17:31.160]  I've actually seen that documentary where they were local reporters and they tried to report on it again and again and again
[3:17:31.160 --> 3:17:37.160]  and they were eventually let go and then they won a lawsuit against the news agency for wrongfully firing them, correct?
[3:17:37.160 --> 3:17:39.160]  That's correct. I think that's correct, yes.
[3:17:39.160 --> 3:17:44.160]  Yeah, no, I'm all, man, I wish I could remember what docket was because it was a really good dock and it shows you
[3:17:44.160 --> 3:17:49.160]  the control that these, you know, GM, like Monsanto is the devil folks.
[3:17:49.160 --> 3:17:51.160]  I mean, these guys do not have your best interests at heart.
[3:17:51.160 --> 3:17:58.160]  They're not only about a bottom line, but they're literally about genetically modifying what we eat and put into our bodies
[3:17:58.160 --> 3:18:01.160]  and having total and complete control over what goes inside of us.
[3:18:01.160 --> 3:18:04.160]  Have you heard of Steve Hickson case?
[3:18:04.160 --> 3:18:10.160]  No, no, definitely not. Steve Hickson. Steve Hickson, a sea cleaner out in Illinois,
[3:18:10.160 --> 3:18:18.160]  his place is broken into, his address book, et cetera, was going through
[3:18:18.160 --> 3:18:24.160]  and I figure he had possibly had a GPS put on his sea cleaning machine
[3:18:24.160 --> 3:18:27.160]  that tracked him to every one of the customers.
[3:18:27.160 --> 3:18:37.160]  And now his customers are being served with papers being sued because Monsanto thinks they're using Monsanto's seed.
[3:18:37.160 --> 3:18:42.160]  Probably isn't even the case. The seed cleaners are being, it's an attempt to put them out a bit of,
[3:18:42.160 --> 3:18:47.160]  FDA has found seed cleaners to be a source of contamination, which is crap.
[3:18:47.160 --> 3:18:50.160]  Seed cleaners merely clean the seeds, right?
[3:18:50.160 --> 3:18:57.160]  And so FDA is saying, well, we've got to put these guys out of business because they are going to contaminate the seeds with their seed cleaners.
[3:18:57.160 --> 3:19:01.160]  What they're really doing is cleaning the seeds for using next year.
[3:19:01.160 --> 3:19:10.160]  However, with Monsanto, you've got to buy new seeds every year and you've got to pay them their legal fee every year.
[3:19:10.160 --> 3:19:16.160]  Monsanto is putting people out of business and the yield doesn't get any better.
[3:19:16.160 --> 3:19:22.160]  Have you heard anything about over in India where these farmers bought this BT cotton seed and it didn't work?
[3:19:22.160 --> 3:19:28.160]  And the farmers in India are thousands of them drinking round up to kill themselves because the stuff didn't work.
[3:19:28.160 --> 3:19:32.160]  Or rather, the BT cotton just didn't yield like they said it was gonna.
[3:19:32.160 --> 3:19:37.160]  And they're killing themselves to get out of there out of debt. It's really sad.
[3:19:37.160 --> 3:19:44.160]  That is really sad, but it just shows you a brutal corporation like Codex around, I'm sorry, Monsanto,
[3:19:44.160 --> 3:19:49.160]  is there to put the little guy out of business and when you see Codex Elementarius being pushed and, you know,
[3:19:49.160 --> 3:19:53.160]  basically supposed to be pushed by 2012, we may not have a choice what goes in our body.
[3:19:53.160 --> 3:20:18.160]  It's P-I-C-F-A.org. Infowars.com, Prismplanet.com.
[3:20:23.160 --> 3:20:28.160]  Loss of weight. It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life,
[3:20:28.160 --> 3:20:34.160]  most people are overly acidic. The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[3:20:34.160 --> 3:20:39.160]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[3:20:39.160 --> 3:20:42.160]  Do your part. Alkalize and supercharge your body now.
[3:20:42.160 --> 3:20:49.160]  Alcovision plasma pH drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink

[3:21:01.160 --> 3:21:09.160]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground Sierra and we knew what to do.
[3:21:09.160 --> 3:21:10.160]  Or at least we thought we did.
[3:21:10.160 --> 3:21:17.160]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[3:21:17.160 --> 3:21:26.160]  Whitman, EVA director on the 18 made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[3:21:26.160 --> 3:21:33.160]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[3:21:33.160 --> 3:21:36.160]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting the countdown.
[3:21:36.160 --> 3:21:42.160]  He takes his hand off and you hear it three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

[3:22:00.160 --> 3:22:06.160]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the US dollar has been devaluating.
[3:22:06.160 --> 3:22:13.160]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances. Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[3:22:13.160 --> 3:22:15.160]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[3:22:15.160 --> 3:22:18.160]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[3:22:18.160 --> 3:22:26.160]  If you had had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now,
[3:22:26.160 --> 3:22:34.160]  your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800, but your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3 million.
[3:22:34.160 --> 3:22:36.160]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.

[3:23:00.160 --> 3:23:04.160]  Alex Jones here with a question. What does humidity mean to you?

[3:24:00.160 --> 3:24:14.160]  Music
[3:24:14.160 --> 3:24:21.160]  Legalize it, don't pasteurize it
[3:24:21.160 --> 3:24:28.160]  Don't homogenize it, just legalize it
[3:24:28.160 --> 3:24:35.160]  It's a longstanding tradition, and it's great in the kitchen
[3:24:35.160 --> 3:24:43.160]  Part of a healthy diet, everyone should buy it
[3:24:43.160 --> 3:24:50.160]  It's the stain our ancestors must not be sequestered
[3:24:50.160 --> 3:24:54.160]  Raw dairy keeps you fit
[3:24:54.160 --> 3:25:01.160]  Let's all reap the benefits, so legalize it
[3:25:01.160 --> 3:25:08.160]  Don't pasteurize it, don't homogenize it
[3:25:08.160 --> 3:25:13.160]  Just legalize it
[3:25:13.160 --> 3:25:20.160]  Raw milk from the farmer, surely will not marmure
[3:25:20.160 --> 3:25:26.160]  There's no need to change it, no chemical rearrangement
[3:25:26.160 --> 3:25:28.160]  It's good for your health
[3:25:28.160 --> 3:25:34.160]  All right folks, we are back in to the Alex Jones show, and that's David Icen with the Real Milk song.
[3:25:34.160 --> 3:25:45.160]  Hopefully all you people that called in and hated on me for having Metallica on will now forgive me for having the Real Milk song and Jonas Stolzfuss.
[3:25:45.160 --> 3:25:49.580]  I'm the Pennsylvania Independent Consumer and Farmers Association.
[3:25:49.580 --> 3:25:53.200]  That's P-I-C-F-A dot org.
[3:25:53.200 --> 3:25:59.920]  And you know, these guys are on the front lines for trying to get you non-GMO fresh foods.
[3:25:59.920 --> 3:26:04.280]  You know, not only milk, not only cheese, but produce as well.
[3:26:04.280 --> 3:26:08.280]  And it's all under attack from these big corporations and the federal government sending in sting
[3:26:08.280 --> 3:26:14.040]  squads, you know, undercover police officers to try to entrap people, like literally begging
[3:26:14.040 --> 3:26:19.240]  to sell for a woman farmer to sell a block of cheese.
[3:26:19.240 --> 3:26:20.800]  That's what the feds are up to.
[3:26:20.800 --> 3:26:22.800]  You know, you think that they're fighting terrorism all the time?
[3:26:22.800 --> 3:26:23.800]  No.
[3:26:23.800 --> 3:26:24.800]  They're here to go after the common man.
[3:26:24.800 --> 3:26:25.800]  I mean, it's the same thing.
[3:26:25.800 --> 3:26:30.120]  I mean, it's just unbelievably, Jonas, how are we going to overcome this?
[3:26:30.120 --> 3:26:31.120]  Dave?
[3:26:31.120 --> 3:26:32.120]  Right here.
[3:26:32.120 --> 3:26:36.360]  I think of my buddy, David, that's got something in that song for us.
[3:26:36.360 --> 3:26:41.640]  The way we overcome this is to get into action.
[3:26:41.640 --> 3:26:45.360]  First of all, find a farmer and buy from him.
[3:26:45.360 --> 3:26:47.560]  That way he can survive.
[3:26:47.560 --> 3:26:50.520]  And of course, I gave you a couple of websites on how to find a farmer.
[3:26:50.520 --> 3:26:56.840]  Localharvest.com, realmilk.com, go to your local farmer's market, get to know that people
[3:26:56.840 --> 3:27:02.560]  talk to them, because there's where you will get food that will help you stay healthy.
[3:27:02.560 --> 3:27:06.640]  No, Moe, you talked about them going after the consumers of this.
[3:27:06.640 --> 3:27:08.760]  They went after somebody's list of customers.
[3:27:08.760 --> 3:27:13.920]  I mean, that is just crazy to me, and how did this even come about?
[3:27:13.920 --> 3:27:19.080]  Well, in this case, it's Monsanto going after the seed producers and going after farmers
[3:27:19.080 --> 3:27:22.400]  who are keeping their seeds and using it over again like they've been doing for centuries.
[3:27:22.400 --> 3:27:30.000]  This is Monsanto attempting to get control of the seeds and thus the food.
[3:27:30.000 --> 3:27:35.040]  But that's a great, great big thing, but we can fight back as consumers by demanding
[3:27:35.040 --> 3:27:40.320]  that our government labels the food that is made with GMO.
[3:27:40.320 --> 3:27:42.280]  Right now, it's about 90%.
[3:27:42.280 --> 3:27:45.080]  But the consumers have a right to know how that food's made.
[3:27:45.080 --> 3:27:47.080]  They have a right to know.
[3:27:47.080 --> 3:27:54.760]  But as consumers who eyes up and educate themselves as a health efficiency, that this halfway
[3:27:54.760 --> 3:28:01.040]  food is given us, and this is why we have such a health problem in this country.
[3:28:01.040 --> 3:28:04.840]  We are not eating nutrient-dense food.
[3:28:04.840 --> 3:28:12.440]  The Westin A Price Foundation has been pushing the idea of eating properly, eating wisely,
[3:28:12.440 --> 3:28:14.360]  eating healthy.
[3:28:14.360 --> 3:28:20.000]  There's so much research that proves that this is the right way to go.
[3:28:20.000 --> 3:28:24.200]  Now, some of the problems with the GMO is that no one's researching it.
[3:28:24.200 --> 3:28:27.640]  We are all guinea pigs, which is not a modified organism.
[3:28:27.640 --> 3:28:29.240]  That's a great way to put it.
[3:28:29.240 --> 3:28:34.040]  We are all guinea pigs for this, and not only that, but we live in such a fast food
[3:28:34.040 --> 3:28:39.000]  culture that sometimes five nights a week, these kids are eating McDonald's and Burger
[3:28:39.000 --> 3:28:42.120]  King, and then when they send their kids off to school, they're eating Lunchables.
[3:28:42.120 --> 3:28:48.280]  I mean, folks, there's literally almost nothing grosser you could give your kid than an Oscar
[3:28:48.280 --> 3:28:54.920]  Meyer Lunchable with meat that's been processed 10 times over cheese that is probably less
[3:28:54.920 --> 3:28:59.360]  than 1% milk, if any.
[3:28:59.360 --> 3:29:03.560]  I see people feed their kids this way, and I don't even know how they live with themselves,
[3:29:03.560 --> 3:29:04.560]  but you're right.
[3:29:04.560 --> 3:29:10.440]  It's because they have no idea how dramatic it's gotten and how terrible this is to put
[3:29:10.440 --> 3:29:11.440]  into your system.
[3:29:11.440 --> 3:29:19.960]  There's a pretty much documented fact that Pashite homogenized milk will foster earache
[3:29:19.960 --> 3:29:22.680]  in infants and young children.
[3:29:22.680 --> 3:29:26.920]  It makes an infant young don't get earache, where if you would feed those infant young
[3:29:26.920 --> 3:29:31.160]  children raw milk, then they'd be much healthier.
[3:29:31.160 --> 3:29:36.160]  We had a case of a foster child at our home, we cat her for about three, we were going
[3:29:36.160 --> 3:29:38.680]  to keep her about two weeks interim seal.
[3:29:38.680 --> 3:29:43.520]  She came to our home and she screamed 18 hours of every day for about two days.
[3:29:43.520 --> 3:29:45.440]  And that was all due to the milk, Jonas.
[3:29:45.440 --> 3:29:52.000]  Jonas Stolfitz of the Pennsylvania Independent Consumers and Farmers Association, PFIAC.org.
[3:29:52.000 --> 3:29:55.680]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[3:29:55.680 --> 3:30:01.880]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:01.880 --> 3:30:05.760]  There is growing evidence that Americans would have better health and a lower incidence of
[3:30:05.760 --> 3:30:11.000]  cancer and fibrocystic disease of the breast if they consumed more iodine.
[3:30:11.000 --> 3:30:15.600]  Neutriodine iodine is formulated to work with your body to help to stimulate proper hormonal
[3:30:15.600 --> 3:30:21.520]  balance and can assist in detoxification from fluoride, bromide and chloride toxins and helps
[3:30:21.520 --> 3:30:25.960]  provide protection from radioactive iodine from nuclear fallout.
[3:30:25.960 --> 3:30:30.880]  Neutriodine is made with a proprietary high energy field from pure crystalline iodine.
[3:30:30.880 --> 3:30:33.520]  Neutriodine should be used by all ages every day.
[3:30:33.520 --> 3:30:37.960]  If you suffer from chronic fatigue, low thyroid and mitochondria function, or if you just
[3:30:37.960 --> 3:30:41.760]  want to feel better from day to day, Neutriodine drops are for you.
[3:30:41.760 --> 3:30:44.200]  There are several forms of iodine.

[3:31:01.600 --> 3:31:07.320]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[3:31:07.320 --> 3:31:08.820]  against this country.
[3:31:08.820 --> 3:31:12.920]  The enemy struck America on September 11th, but who is the enemy?
[3:31:12.920 --> 3:31:13.920]  Bin Laden.
[3:31:13.920 --> 3:31:14.920]  This is his MO.
[3:31:14.920 --> 3:31:15.920]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[3:31:15.920 --> 3:31:17.920]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[3:31:17.920 --> 3:31:22.240]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to
[3:31:22.240 --> 3:31:25.400]  intelligence networks inside the United States.
[3:31:25.400 --> 3:31:29.880]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[3:31:29.880 --> 3:31:32.040]  in and on the U.S.
[3:31:32.040 --> 3:31:35.640]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:31:35.640 --> 3:31:41.160]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[3:31:41.160 --> 3:31:45.320]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much,
[3:31:45.320 --> 3:31:46.320]  much more.
[3:31:46.320 --> 3:31:47.320]  Fabled Enemies.

[3:33:07.800 --> 3:33:28.000]  All right folks, we are back, it's the Alex Jones show, I am Jason Bermas sitting in
[3:33:28.000 --> 3:33:29.000]  all week.
[3:33:29.000 --> 3:33:33.040]  We just got done with Jonas Stahlsfitts of the Pennsylvania Independent Consumer and
[3:33:33.040 --> 3:33:37.440]  Farmers Association, but that's not the end of the story.
[3:33:37.440 --> 3:33:43.360]  We actually now have Maurice Thompson of the Buckeye Institute, and they were called to
[3:33:43.360 --> 3:33:49.360]  action, basically the Buckeye Institute's 1851 Center for Constitutional Law.
[3:33:49.360 --> 3:33:55.000]  Today took legal action, that was in December 17th, against the Ohio Department of Agriculture
[3:33:55.000 --> 3:33:58.960]  and the Lorraine County Health Department for violating the constitutional rights of
[3:33:58.960 --> 3:34:02.000]  John and Jacqueline Stores of Lorraine, Ohio.
[3:34:02.000 --> 3:34:06.400]  The Stores operate an organic food cooperative called Manistore House Biblical Reference.
[3:34:06.400 --> 3:34:11.320]  ODA and Lorraine County Health Department agents forcefully raided their home and unlawfully
[3:34:11.320 --> 3:34:14.920]  seized the family's personal food supplies, cell phones, and personal computers.
[3:34:14.920 --> 3:34:18.960]  See, they don't just take your phone, they don't just take your food, they take your
[3:34:18.960 --> 3:34:22.760]  phone and your technology, really just like not only crippling your business, but your
[3:34:22.760 --> 3:34:23.760]  day to day life.
[3:34:23.760 --> 3:34:24.760]  They're really nice people.
[3:34:24.760 --> 3:34:29.240]  The legal center seeks to halt the future, halt future similar raids, I hope so, I hope
[3:34:29.240 --> 3:34:32.000]  that the Buckeye Institute can do that.
[3:34:32.000 --> 3:34:35.840]  The complaint was filed in Lorraine County Court of Common Pleas.
[3:34:35.840 --> 3:34:40.560]  The use of these police state tactics on a peaceful family is simply unacceptable, Buckeye
[3:34:40.560 --> 3:34:45.040]  Institute President David Hansen said, officers rushed into the Stores home with guns drawn
[3:34:45.040 --> 3:34:50.040]  and held the family, including 10 young children, captive for six hours.
[3:34:50.040 --> 3:34:56.600]  See this is a farmhouse family, I mean 10 kids and they have a farm, God forbid they
[3:34:56.600 --> 3:35:00.120]  feed their kids with the food they grow.
[3:35:00.120 --> 3:35:05.400]  This outrageous case of bureaucratic overreach must be addressed and I couldn't agree more.
[3:35:05.400 --> 3:35:07.520]  Mr. Thompson, thank you for joining us.
[3:35:07.520 --> 3:35:08.520]  You do.
[3:35:08.520 --> 3:35:13.760]  Why don't you first tell people about the organization and then how they can get involved?
[3:35:13.760 --> 3:35:14.760]  Absolutely.
[3:35:14.760 --> 3:35:17.400]  Well, our organization is the Buckeye Institute.
[3:35:17.400 --> 3:35:21.120]  I run the 1851 Center, which is our legal arm.
[3:35:21.120 --> 3:35:27.080]  We litigate constitutional issues that basically implicate people's rights to be left alone
[3:35:27.080 --> 3:35:33.680]  by the government and that comes in a myriad of forms, including lower taxes, less government
[3:35:33.680 --> 3:35:40.640]  spending, less government regulation, property rights, and the right to contract issues like
[3:35:40.640 --> 3:35:44.720]  we have here, police state type issues.
[3:35:44.720 --> 3:35:52.240]  The Buckeye Institute itself is also a think tank, so it writes policy papers and argues
[3:35:52.240 --> 3:35:56.080]  for limited government across multiple areas.
[3:35:56.080 --> 3:36:00.640]  Also education reform is an important issue we focus on.
[3:36:00.640 --> 3:36:07.560]  The best way to get involved is probably to go to our website, which is www.buckeyeinstitute.org,
[3:36:07.560 --> 3:36:12.160]  where you can check out our work and where you can also check out this particular case.
[3:36:12.160 --> 3:36:17.360]  There you'll find a about a five to six minute statement from the family themselves, which
[3:36:17.360 --> 3:36:21.080]  I think is very important because people can see that and understand that these are normal
[3:36:21.080 --> 3:36:26.400]  people, peaceful people, just like you and I, and that this could really happen to anybody.
[3:36:26.400 --> 3:36:29.720]  There they'll also be able to view our legal filings in the case and follow the case as
[3:36:29.720 --> 3:36:34.120]  it proceeds through the courts, and also our press release, which gives a much shorter
[3:36:34.120 --> 3:36:38.560]  description, as much easier to read than the legal filings themselves.
[3:36:38.560 --> 3:36:45.400]  Yeah, it's absolute insanity that they raid a family of 12, the adults, the 10 kids, they
[3:36:45.400 --> 3:36:50.640]  hold them hostage for six hours, they take not only their food supply, but the food
[3:36:50.640 --> 3:36:54.280]  supply that they're going to live off, basically their way of living, and then that's not enough.
[3:36:54.280 --> 3:36:57.160]  You know what, we're going to take your phones and your computers, we're going to see who
[3:36:57.160 --> 3:37:01.160]  your customers are and who you're contacting, and they're probably going to run undercover
[3:37:01.160 --> 3:37:02.680]  SWAT teams on them as well.
[3:37:02.680 --> 3:37:07.840]  Well, the one thing that you neglected to mention, your otherwise excellent introduction
[3:37:07.840 --> 3:37:13.400]  of the issue, was the reason for this raid, and I think that a lot of your listeners,
[3:37:13.400 --> 3:37:16.840]  I think I've been on the show before and a lot of your listeners may already be familiar
[3:37:16.840 --> 3:37:24.360]  with the issue, but this is a case where a group of police officers show up and engage
[3:37:24.360 --> 3:37:28.800]  in SWAT-like tactics, force their way into the house with guns drawn.
[3:37:28.800 --> 3:37:34.280]  The lead officer is an officer of the violent fugitive task force, and the family is rounded
[3:37:34.280 --> 3:37:39.680]  up and held while multiple agents come in and comb over the entire property.
[3:37:39.680 --> 3:37:43.720]  But the lead up to that is just as important, and it's an important that your listeners
[3:37:43.720 --> 3:37:52.160]  understand what precipitated this raid, and these people aren't crack dealers, they're
[3:37:52.160 --> 3:37:55.400]  not engaged in any kind of violent crime.
[3:37:55.400 --> 3:38:00.320]  Their crime, in the government's eyes, was doing business without the proper license.
[3:38:00.320 --> 3:38:05.040]  Yeah, and selling a dozen eggs, a dozen eggs.
[3:38:05.040 --> 3:38:06.040]  That's correct.
[3:38:06.040 --> 3:38:12.800]  That was the only transaction that the government used to justify this raid, and to argue that
[3:38:12.800 --> 3:38:18.360]  this is a retail food establishment doing business without a retail food establishment
[3:38:18.360 --> 3:38:19.360]  license.
[3:38:19.360 --> 3:38:23.040]  It's totally insanity, I mean, you can go get a dozen eggs for less than $2, here they
[3:38:23.040 --> 3:38:28.640]  are spending thousands of dollars to ruin a family's way of life, really.
[3:38:28.640 --> 3:38:33.360]  I mean, what are these guys supposed to do without their crop, without their food?
[3:38:33.360 --> 3:38:38.480]  They have a family of 10 to feed, I mean, this is just, it's beyond insanity, and like
[3:38:38.480 --> 3:38:42.360]  you said, these aren't crack dealers, this isn't somebody with a meth house.
[3:38:42.360 --> 3:38:46.840]  These are people who are genuinely trying to help other people stay healthy and doing
[3:38:46.840 --> 3:38:51.200]  so in really a constitutional manner, and that's why your institute has taken to the
[3:38:51.200 --> 3:38:52.200]  cause.
[3:38:52.200 --> 3:38:58.920]  Well, that's absolutely correct, to write a little bit more background, what the Man
[3:38:58.920 --> 3:39:03.920]  of Storehouse basically is, is a family-run farm and food co-op.
[3:39:03.920 --> 3:39:09.000]  What the family does is that they take orders from their neighbors and other members of
[3:39:09.000 --> 3:39:14.040]  the co-op, and it is a private co-op, so this is not a, you know, a giant eagle or a Kroger's
[3:39:14.040 --> 3:39:19.160]  where anybody can walk in off of the street and purchase food, which is important since
[3:39:19.160 --> 3:39:21.320]  there are no arms like transactions.
[3:39:21.320 --> 3:39:25.280]  Everybody that's a member of the co-op knows exactly where the food comes from, it comes
[3:39:25.280 --> 3:39:31.320]  from local farmers, mostly Amish and Mennonite farmers in this very rural area, and they
[3:39:31.320 --> 3:39:36.800]  have sought out the Stowers family in the Man of Storehouse because the Stowers family
[3:39:36.800 --> 3:39:43.280]  has connections to farmers who engage in farming practices that all these people have sought
[3:39:43.280 --> 3:39:50.560]  after and approve of, namely pesticide-free produce, grain fed, or I'm sorry, graph fed
[3:39:50.560 --> 3:39:58.400]  cattle, graph fed chicken as well, pastured chicken, so these people have been sought out
[3:39:58.400 --> 3:40:03.040]  and they've freely entered into a contract with the Stowers for the provision of this
[3:40:03.040 --> 3:40:04.040]  food.
[3:40:04.040 --> 3:40:08.240]  What they do is they order and bulk together, you and I may not be able to either afford
[3:40:08.240 --> 3:40:15.200]  or store a 55-gallon drum of wheat or the meat from one entire cow, but if we purchase
[3:40:15.200 --> 3:40:19.240]  it together, we can each afford it and then we can split it up as well and then have a
[3:40:19.240 --> 3:40:20.800]  place to store it.
[3:40:20.800 --> 3:40:26.200]  That's the premise of a co-op and that's exactly what has been going on up with the
[3:40:26.200 --> 3:40:28.240]  Man of Storehouse.
[3:40:28.240 --> 3:40:30.920]  And this is of the most fundamental type of behavior.
[3:40:30.920 --> 3:40:35.040]  This is the kind of behavior that many people engage in in this form and other forms in
[3:40:35.040 --> 3:40:40.520]  the country today, and it's certainly our grandparents engaged in, how many of us don't
[3:40:40.520 --> 3:40:45.520]  have a grandparent that maybe drove down the road to buy some local produce from the local
[3:40:45.520 --> 3:40:47.240]  farmer at one time or another?
[3:40:47.240 --> 3:40:52.640]  My grandfather had his own little, it wasn't much of a farm, I mean he'd grow his own produce
[3:40:52.640 --> 3:40:55.480]  in the back and it's something we used to do together when I was a small child and
[3:40:55.480 --> 3:40:57.560]  then we'd harvest it together and we'd eat it.
[3:40:57.560 --> 3:41:02.880]  I mean he used to grow watermelons and cucumbers and carrots, it was actually a nice thing
[3:41:02.880 --> 3:41:08.000]  to do and then you actually have food that you can feed your kid or your grand kid with
[3:41:08.000 --> 3:41:10.360]  a clean conscience, God forbid.
[3:41:10.360 --> 3:41:15.480]  Sure, and the government's argument, and this is an argument by many state governments,
[3:41:15.480 --> 3:41:21.240]  not just Ohio these days, is that that kind of activity should be licensed and requires
[3:41:21.240 --> 3:41:26.320]  a retail food establishment license, which is the same kind of license that a very large
[3:41:26.320 --> 3:41:30.480]  commercial grocery store is required to have.
[3:41:30.480 --> 3:41:35.760]  And what this really gets us into, I think the Alex Jones show is excellent for always
[3:41:35.760 --> 3:41:42.560]  having individuals to discuss federal constitutional law on, but there's a very important conflict
[3:41:42.560 --> 3:41:48.320]  here that's going on in the states and this is between something called the police power,
[3:41:48.320 --> 3:41:55.320]  which is the state's ability to regulate things and our fundamental constitutional rights.
[3:41:55.320 --> 3:42:00.240]  And these two are conflicting and courts aren't always making the right call on these issues
[3:42:00.240 --> 3:42:07.120]  and that's one of the reasons the Buckeye Institute's 1851 Center came into existence.
[3:42:07.120 --> 3:42:10.640]  A lot of people may have heard of this term, police power.
[3:42:10.640 --> 3:42:11.640]  What does this really mean though?
[3:42:11.640 --> 3:42:15.640]  It actually has nothing to do with the police themselves.
[3:42:15.640 --> 3:42:20.520]  What this is, is the power that government has to enforce laws against people who injure
[3:42:20.520 --> 3:42:21.520]  other people.
[3:42:21.520 --> 3:42:27.360]  In other words, most of us believe in the Lockean social compact theory of government, that
[3:42:27.360 --> 3:42:32.520]  we were all free individuals first when we had rights from God and that we had inalienable
[3:42:32.520 --> 3:42:37.320]  and natural rights from God and that we came together and formed governments only to protect
[3:42:37.320 --> 3:42:42.400]  ourselves from injury from others and to protect our property, that that was the fundamental
[3:42:42.400 --> 3:42:44.560]  original reason for government.
[3:42:44.560 --> 3:42:49.640]  And so instead of engaging in vigilanteism, we delegated to government the authority to
[3:42:49.640 --> 3:42:52.400]  enforce these rights on our behalf.
[3:42:52.400 --> 3:42:57.160]  That's the police power and that's really the only legitimate power of government.
[3:42:57.160 --> 3:43:02.680]  You know, you juxtapose that with our natural rights, our rights to be free, to use and
[3:43:02.680 --> 3:43:08.320]  to acquire property and for adults to enter into contracts that are voluntary.
[3:43:08.320 --> 3:43:13.560]  And there's no question here that state governments don't have the authority to regulate this
[3:43:13.560 --> 3:43:21.520]  type of behavior and that our fundamental rights are certainly at issue in these kinds
[3:43:21.520 --> 3:43:25.880]  of cases dealing with these kinds of contracts and this type of property.
[3:43:25.880 --> 3:43:29.440]  And this is certainly the type of behavior that the people engage in at the time the
[3:43:29.440 --> 3:43:35.480]  Constitution was founded, which is also important because most states have residual rights
[3:43:35.480 --> 3:43:41.880]  clauses that indicate that rights are retained by the people where they're not delegated
[3:43:41.880 --> 3:43:43.480]  to government.
[3:43:43.480 --> 3:43:47.120]  And we have one of those at the federal level, it's called the Ninth Amendment, and most
[3:43:47.120 --> 3:43:49.040]  states also have those.
[3:43:49.040 --> 3:43:54.680]  What that means is that your constitutional rights aren't just the rights that are specified
[3:43:54.680 --> 3:44:00.760]  in the Constitution, they include also unenumerated rights that are so infinite that they couldn't
[3:44:00.760 --> 3:44:05.520]  all be imagined and put into paper, as James Madison said, when he passed the Ninth Amendment.
[3:44:05.520 --> 3:44:11.720]  Absolutely, and this is a grab for more power, so I want to know, number one, where is this
[3:44:11.720 --> 3:44:15.760]  case at, obviously, to relatively new case, the Stoers, and then how can people get involved
[3:44:15.760 --> 3:44:16.760]  to help this family?
[3:44:16.760 --> 3:44:19.560]  Because I'm sure they're going to need help not only on the legal end, but if they took
[3:44:19.560 --> 3:44:22.400]  all their food, they're probably going to need some financial help as well.
[3:44:22.400 --> 3:44:23.400]  How can people get involved?
[3:44:23.400 --> 3:44:26.480]  And how can people help the Buckeye Institute and the Stoers family?
[3:44:26.480 --> 3:44:27.480]  Sure.
[3:44:27.480 --> 3:44:31.760]  Well, first off, your first question was as to the status of the case.
[3:44:31.760 --> 3:44:36.080]  We filed our complaint approximately one month ago, not quite that long ago, in fact.
[3:44:36.080 --> 3:44:37.880]  So it is a relatively new case.
[3:44:37.880 --> 3:44:44.800]  The raid was just on December 1st, and at that time, soon after the raid, the prosecutor,
[3:44:44.800 --> 3:44:51.120]  the local prosecutor up there, got on the media and bumped his chest and indicated he
[3:44:51.120 --> 3:44:53.840]  was going to be filing charges against this family.
[3:44:53.840 --> 3:44:58.480]  So that certainly caught our attention along with the raid itself.
[3:44:58.480 --> 3:45:03.000]  So we decided we would beat the prosecutor over the courthouse and go ahead and file
[3:45:03.000 --> 3:45:08.000]  a lawsuit against them before they filed any against our clients.
[3:45:08.000 --> 3:45:09.800]  Right now, our complaint's been filed.
[3:45:09.800 --> 3:45:13.680]  We're awaiting an answer from the government.
[3:45:13.680 --> 3:45:17.880]  From that time, maybe about a month from now, maybe a little longer than that, a preliminary
[3:45:17.880 --> 3:45:20.520]  injunction hearing will be held.
[3:45:20.520 --> 3:45:24.640]  And there'll be a full-blown hearing where we'll have a chance to hear from these officers
[3:45:24.640 --> 3:45:28.440]  and from these government agents as to why they did what they did, which should be very
[3:45:28.440 --> 3:45:29.440]  interesting.
[3:45:29.440 --> 3:45:37.880]  And at that time, the judge will also have an opportunity to enjoin the behavior of the
[3:45:37.880 --> 3:45:42.840]  government and to stop them from doing this, at least preliminarily, while the case proceeds
[3:45:42.840 --> 3:45:46.760]  over the course of normal channels.
[3:45:46.760 --> 3:45:54.360]  As to what your listeners can do to get involved, I would certainly urge them to speak with
[3:45:54.360 --> 3:45:56.360]  the ODA about this matter.
[3:45:56.360 --> 3:45:58.400]  There are a number of bad actors here.
[3:45:58.400 --> 3:46:03.480]  The local health department was certainly a bad actor, and the Raine County Health Department
[3:46:03.480 --> 3:46:07.440]  certainly deserves some flack, as does the Ohio Department of Agriculture.
[3:46:07.440 --> 3:46:11.440]  They treated this like a drug raid from the outset and a drug investigation.
[3:46:11.440 --> 3:46:12.520]  They surveilled the family.
[3:46:12.520 --> 3:46:16.880]  They went undercover and lied to the family to try to become a member of the co-op.
[3:46:16.880 --> 3:46:23.640]  And ultimately, the Ohio Department of Agriculture agent got those eggs that you mentioned earlier
[3:46:23.640 --> 3:46:27.480]  by staying at the family's house for two hours and refusing to leave without them.
[3:46:27.480 --> 3:46:31.560]  And so finally, they just gave them the eggs and he slapped some money down on the table.
[3:46:31.560 --> 3:46:36.240]  And that was the alleged retail transaction that you referred to.
[3:46:36.240 --> 3:46:39.080]  There are a lot of bad actors here that deserve a lot of flack.
[3:46:39.080 --> 3:46:43.680]  And of course, ultimately, the governor of Ohio is in control of the Department of Agriculture
[3:46:43.680 --> 3:46:45.720]  because it's an executive agency.
[3:46:45.720 --> 3:46:47.720]  So he deserves some heat as well.
[3:46:47.720 --> 3:46:52.280]  And it would be good for the court to know that people care about this case because judges
[3:46:52.280 --> 3:46:56.800]  are elected, prosecutors are elected, and that's the Raine County Court of Common Pleas, it's
[3:46:56.800 --> 3:46:59.640]  currently handling it.
[3:46:59.640 --> 3:47:03.520]  And the sheriff there is elected, so that's important.
[3:47:03.520 --> 3:47:07.440]  Perhaps more fundamentally than that, we're always appreciative of donations here at the
[3:47:07.440 --> 3:47:11.960]  Buckeye Institute, the website again is buckeyeinstitute.org.
[3:47:11.960 --> 3:47:16.960]  And the more donations we receive, the more cases like this we can handle.
[3:47:16.960 --> 3:47:22.760]  And that's quite important because these paramilitary-style police rates are on the rise, and they're
[3:47:22.760 --> 3:47:28.400]  on the rise even in contexts like this, where there's only an administrative infraction
[3:47:28.400 --> 3:47:29.920]  at issue.
[3:47:29.920 --> 3:47:34.640]  And we want to head these off to the past before they become nationwide and before they
[3:47:34.640 --> 3:47:38.760]  become police's regular way of doing business in this country.
[3:47:38.760 --> 3:47:44.640]  So that would be quite important if you'd like to see us handle more cases like this
[3:47:44.640 --> 3:47:45.640]  one.
[3:47:45.640 --> 3:47:51.640]  Other than that, the phone calls are great, and the family could also use support.
[3:47:51.640 --> 3:47:55.200]  And if you do donate in your market for the family, we can get that support to them as
[3:47:55.200 --> 3:47:56.200]  well.
[3:47:56.200 --> 3:47:57.200]  Absolutely.
[3:47:57.200 --> 3:48:01.040]  So listeners, this is a case that you do need to get involved in.
[3:48:01.040 --> 3:48:06.200]  Like you said, you want to head these off at the past, and the Buckeye Institute, they're
[3:48:06.200 --> 3:48:11.360]  institutes that are few and far between with a limited amount of people on the staff.
[3:48:11.360 --> 3:48:15.880]  I know I'm in an office with a limited amount of people on the staff, and it really is only
[3:48:15.880 --> 3:48:19.040]  through your funding that we're able to do more.
[3:48:19.040 --> 3:48:24.640]  And this is something that could probably go on court for a year or two, isn't it?
[3:48:24.640 --> 3:48:30.320]  Well, the way that these things typically work in Ohio, I think in most states, is that
[3:48:30.320 --> 3:48:36.800]  trial court judges are kind of the low man on the totem pole, and they're very risk averse.
[3:48:36.800 --> 3:48:41.840]  They're very unlikely to make a significant constitutional decision on their own.
[3:48:41.840 --> 3:48:45.760]  So a lot of times, we will win these cases eventually, but you're right.
[3:48:45.760 --> 3:48:50.800]  A lot of times we'll win them in the appeals court or even at the Supreme Court.
[3:48:50.800 --> 3:48:53.000]  We can't always win them at the trial court level.
[3:48:53.000 --> 3:48:58.320]  So it's true, these cases do take a lot more resources when you're asking the court to
[3:48:58.320 --> 3:49:02.040]  find the government's action on constitutional, because the court ultimately is part of the
[3:49:02.040 --> 3:49:03.320]  government, too.
[3:49:03.320 --> 3:49:08.440]  They're highly deferential to the government, more so than they should be under the Constitution.
[3:49:08.440 --> 3:49:12.840]  But they're highly deferential, especially the local government, because those are the
[3:49:12.840 --> 3:49:16.600]  people they bump into in the hallway in the courthouse every day.
[3:49:16.600 --> 3:49:17.600]  Exactly.
[3:49:17.600 --> 3:49:19.960]  They all collude with one another, and you're right.
[3:49:19.960 --> 3:49:22.640]  When you are taking on the establishment, when you're taking on the government, especially
[3:49:22.640 --> 3:49:28.240]  at a local level, your chances are not so great at being able to end the case and end
[3:49:28.240 --> 3:49:29.240]  it constitutionally.
[3:49:29.240 --> 3:49:33.440]  You often do have to go to the appeals court or a higher court in order to do so, and that
[3:49:33.440 --> 3:49:35.000]  takes a lot of funding to folks.
[3:49:35.000 --> 3:49:39.880]  It takes a lot of time, a lot of patience, and it takes institutes like the Buckeye Institute
[3:49:39.880 --> 3:49:43.880]  to take these on, because most people are in the dark about all this.
[3:49:43.880 --> 3:49:45.840]  They don't even understand why it affects them.
[3:49:45.840 --> 3:49:52.240]  Well, when you can swat team an entire family for a dozen eggs, and that family includes
[3:49:52.240 --> 3:49:57.560]  10 children, and they treat it like a drug raid, like this guy is selling ecstasy from
[3:49:57.560 --> 3:49:58.560]  his front door.
[3:49:58.560 --> 3:50:01.480]  I think there's a huge problem with that.
[3:50:01.480 --> 3:50:03.280]  That really is the whole story, by the way.
[3:50:03.280 --> 3:50:07.680]  Some of your listeners might be thinking, well, there's more to this, but there really
[3:50:07.680 --> 3:50:08.680]  isn't.
[3:50:08.680 --> 3:50:14.240]  Under the Fourth Amendment, one home is his castle, and he's entitled to a certain amount
[3:50:14.240 --> 3:50:20.160]  of dignity and privacy and respect within that home.
[3:50:20.160 --> 3:50:24.440]  It was the British soldiers showing up at your front door and writing their own search
[3:50:24.440 --> 3:50:28.040]  warrants after speaking with you if they didn't like your answers.
[3:50:28.040 --> 3:50:33.360]  It was ultimately one of the events that pushed the colonists here in America over the edge,
[3:50:33.360 --> 3:50:38.560]  and so you cannot really put a price on how important these protections are.
[3:50:38.560 --> 3:50:43.680]  In this case, the family was not dangerous, and they were not going to destroy the evidence,
[3:50:43.680 --> 3:50:47.720]  and we are fighting for that right to protect people's homes.
[3:50:47.720 --> 3:50:50.680]  Maurice Thompson of the Buckeye Institute, thank you so much for joining us.
[3:50:50.680 --> 3:50:52.600]  We're going to take your calls in the last segment.
[3:50:52.600 --> 3:50:53.720]  This is the Alex Jones Show.

[3:51:52.000 --> 3:51:53.000]  of other titles.
[3:51:53.000 --> 3:51:55.720]  We're in a no-holds-far information war.
[3:51:55.720 --> 3:52:00.360]  Truth is our weapon, and PrismPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back
[3:52:00.360 --> 3:52:01.360]  to Big Brother.
[3:52:01.360 --> 3:52:05.280]  So you finally decided you're going to stock up and store food.
[3:52:05.280 --> 3:52:07.840]  But why settle for bland, tasteless food?
[3:52:07.840 --> 3:52:09.320]  Why settle for less?
[3:52:09.320 --> 3:52:11.120]  There is an alternative.
[3:52:11.120 --> 3:52:12.760]  Internetgrocer.net.

[3:52:16.240 --> 3:52:19.960]  Enjoy creamy, delicious, real cheddar cheese in a can.
[3:52:19.960 --> 3:52:23.440]  And dodge in real canned meats and real canned butter.
[3:52:23.440 --> 3:52:27.480]  Storable meals from internetgrocer.net will bring such variety and flavor you won't be
[3:52:27.480 --> 3:52:30.080]  able to tell you're actually eating storable food.
[3:52:30.080 --> 3:52:32.440]  You can purchase by the can or by the case.
[3:52:32.440 --> 3:52:35.600]  Choose a variety pack or an entire year's worth of food.
[3:52:35.600 --> 3:52:39.960]  Internetgrocer.net has non-hybrid seeds that will produce delicious food for you and your
[3:52:39.960 --> 3:52:40.960]  family.
[3:52:40.960 --> 3:52:42.920]  Ensure your food supply for years.
[3:52:42.920 --> 3:52:45.680]  Find out just how delicious storable food can be.
[3:52:45.680 --> 3:52:55.160]  Call 903-356-6443, that's 903-356-6443, open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Central Standard Time,
[3:52:55.160 --> 3:53:01.880]  or shop online at internet-grocer.net, again that's internet-grocer.net.
[3:53:01.880 --> 3:53:05.360]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[3:53:05.360 --> 3:53:09.240]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers
[3:53:09.240 --> 3:53:10.840]  than when drinking the water?
[3:53:10.840 --> 3:53:14.680]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed
[3:53:14.680 --> 3:53:15.840]  into the skin.
[3:53:15.840 --> 3:53:20.520]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water and is designed to
[3:53:20.520 --> 3:53:26.120]  reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold,
[3:53:26.120 --> 3:53:27.360]  algae and fungus.
[3:53:27.360 --> 3:53:32.240]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year whichever
[3:53:32.240 --> 3:53:33.240]  comes first.
[3:53:33.240 --> 3:53:37.440]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine,
[3:53:37.440 --> 3:53:39.480]  iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[3:53:39.480 --> 3:53:40.480]  What about you?
[3:53:40.480 --> 3:53:45.960]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free
[3:53:45.960 --> 3:53:46.960]  shipping.
[3:53:46.960 --> 3:53:52.480]  Call the Berkey Guy and order now by calling 1-877-886-3653.
[3:53:52.480 --> 3:53:59.280]  That's 1-877-886-3653, or simply click on the banner at GCNLive.com to order online
[3:53:59.280 --> 3:54:22.880]  now.
[3:54:22.880 --> 3:54:26.880]  I'm probably going to get calls about that one too.
[3:54:26.880 --> 3:54:29.880]  Johnny Cash, leave this out in this last segment.
[3:54:29.880 --> 3:54:36.880]  Remember, you can get the entire four hours again over at infowords.com right after this broadcast.
[3:54:36.880 --> 3:54:38.880]  We play it on a loop every day.
[3:54:38.880 --> 3:54:40.880]  That means you get a six times a day, folks.
[3:54:40.880 --> 3:54:42.880]  How many people offer that for free? Not many.
[3:54:42.880 --> 3:54:50.880]  And two hours of video broadcasts for the PrisonPlanet.tv subscribers might explain that Metallica song that I played for most of you guys.
[3:54:50.880 --> 3:54:52.880]  I can't believe all the calls we got about it.
[3:54:52.880 --> 3:54:58.880]  But when you're talking about eugenics, when you're talking about chemtrails and you're a platinum selling band,
[3:54:58.880 --> 3:55:00.880]  are you really the biggest band in the world?
[3:55:00.880 --> 3:55:03.880]  That's right, Metallica now.
[3:55:03.880 --> 3:55:05.880]  The Rolling Stones, they're going to die soon.
[3:55:05.880 --> 3:55:07.880]  They're not going to be around forever.
[3:55:07.880 --> 3:55:08.880]  Metallica, they're going to be around.
[3:55:08.880 --> 3:55:11.880]  They're probably the biggest band in the world.
[3:55:11.880 --> 3:55:14.880]  And when they're having social commentary on chemtrails, I think it's important,
[3:55:14.880 --> 3:55:16.880]  especially when they're pro-chemtrails.
[3:55:16.880 --> 3:55:18.880]  That has to be exposed.
[3:55:18.880 --> 3:55:22.880]  I want to remind listeners that Tierney Crusher 1.
[3:55:22.880 --> 3:55:25.880]  That's Tierney Crusher 1 right there on eBay.
[3:55:25.880 --> 3:55:28.880]  He's going for around 47 Gs right now.
[3:55:28.880 --> 3:55:30.880]  We need the money to expand.
[3:55:30.880 --> 3:55:32.880]  There's a lot of empty offices here.
[3:55:32.880 --> 3:55:33.880]  Who knows? Maybe it does well.
[3:55:33.880 --> 3:55:35.880]  Jason Bermas comes down to Austin, Texas.
[3:55:35.880 --> 3:55:37.880]  And he makes it his home.
[3:55:37.880 --> 3:55:39.880]  We'll pump out twice as many movies, folks.
[3:55:39.880 --> 3:55:44.880]  I promise you, if I come down here, either that or I'll die an early death from no sleep at all.
[3:55:44.880 --> 3:55:49.880]  All right. Remember, Tierney Crusher 1, if you've got the money out there,
[3:55:49.880 --> 3:55:52.880]  I know there are some pretty big celebrities that listen to this show.
[3:55:52.880 --> 3:55:54.880]  I don't know if they stay tuned for me.
[3:55:54.880 --> 3:55:57.880]  But if you're listening out there, we could use the scratch over here.
[3:55:57.880 --> 3:56:01.880]  Everything gets put into new offices, new films.
[3:56:01.880 --> 3:56:03.880]  There it is. There's Tierney Crusher 1.
[3:56:03.880 --> 3:56:05.880]  And just the expansion.
[3:56:05.880 --> 3:56:07.880]  I mean, Aaron works so hard here.
[3:56:07.880 --> 3:56:11.880]  Rob works so hard to see them both get the office that they deserve is great.
[3:56:11.880 --> 3:56:15.880]  We got Jaren here now.
[3:56:15.880 --> 3:56:17.880]  Paul Hartman's been here for a while.
[3:56:17.880 --> 3:56:20.880]  He came in over the summer. It's just an expanding, great crowd.
[3:56:20.880 --> 3:56:24.880]  And if you want us to expand, you want us to get slicker, you want us to reach more people,
[3:56:24.880 --> 3:56:26.880]  we need that support.
[3:56:26.880 --> 3:56:28.880]  And why not own Tierney Crusher 1?
[3:56:28.880 --> 3:56:30.880]  This is a real piece of history.
[3:56:30.880 --> 3:56:33.880]  All right. Let's go to the last three callers.
[3:56:33.880 --> 3:56:35.880]  You only got a couple.
[3:56:35.880 --> 3:56:37.880]  You got less than a minute to make your point, folks.
[3:56:37.880 --> 3:56:40.880]  Carla in Pennsylvania, what's on your mind?
[3:56:40.880 --> 3:56:46.880]  I just was wondering what happened to your friend that made the first video with you.
[3:56:46.880 --> 3:56:48.880]  Are you talking about Dylan and Corey?
[3:56:48.880 --> 3:56:50.880]  I think his name's Corey.
[3:56:50.880 --> 3:56:52.880]  Yeah, yeah. They're still around.
[3:56:52.880 --> 3:56:56.880]  Corey's in college right now and Dylan's out in California working on some other project.
[3:56:56.880 --> 3:57:00.880]  I don't know if it's going to be Patriot related, but everybody's still working.
[3:57:00.880 --> 3:57:05.880]  I'm working on now my second film outside of the Loose Change series.
[3:57:05.880 --> 3:57:07.880]  I'm working on Invisible Empire.
[3:57:07.880 --> 3:57:11.880]  But, you know, I've also put that on hold while I'm down here to work on the Obama film
[3:57:11.880 --> 3:57:13.880]  because it's an important film.
[3:57:13.880 --> 3:57:15.880]  I love Alex Jones' films.
[3:57:15.880 --> 3:57:17.880]  I got to help out a little bit with them.
[3:57:17.880 --> 3:57:20.880]  Yeah, well, we haven't heard much from them lately, so I was just wondering.
[3:57:20.880 --> 3:57:22.880]  Yeah, no, they're out on the internet.
[3:57:22.880 --> 3:57:24.880]  Go check out MySpace.com.
[3:57:24.880 --> 3:57:25.880]  You can get ahold of them.
[3:57:25.880 --> 3:57:26.880]  I thank you for the call, Carla.
[3:57:26.880 --> 3:57:28.880]  All right. Let's go to Tom in Pennsylvania.
[3:57:28.880 --> 3:57:30.880]  Tom, what's on your mind?
[3:57:30.880 --> 3:57:31.880]  Hello, Jason.
[3:57:31.880 --> 3:57:32.880]  Yes, sir.
[3:57:32.880 --> 3:57:36.880]  Hey, I had a comment on the milk thing.
[3:57:36.880 --> 3:57:37.880]  All right.
[3:57:37.880 --> 3:57:43.880]  A way for this to be handled other than the co-ops is for the people who are actually
[3:57:43.880 --> 3:57:48.880]  going in to get milk to buy cows from the guy.
[3:57:48.880 --> 3:57:50.880]  That way you're getting your own milk.
[3:57:50.880 --> 3:57:51.880]  You're not buying milk.
[3:57:51.880 --> 3:57:53.880]  You're not buying unprocessed milk.
[3:57:53.880 --> 3:57:56.880]  You're buying a cow and you're using your own product.
[3:57:56.880 --> 3:57:58.880]  You know, that sounds great, Tom.
[3:57:58.880 --> 3:58:01.880]  Unfortunately, most people do not have a shed to keep that cow,
[3:58:01.880 --> 3:58:05.880]  nor a willing son or daughter to go milk that cow in the morning.
[3:58:05.880 --> 3:58:06.880]  I mean, it's a great idea.
[3:58:06.880 --> 3:58:09.880]  You know, you live in an apartment that's also going to be a tight squeeze,
[3:58:09.880 --> 3:58:10.880]  you and the cow.
[3:58:10.880 --> 3:58:13.880]  I think that, you know, in general, we should probably just stop prosecuting
[3:58:13.880 --> 3:58:16.880]  farmers for farming and selling us food that's good for us.
[3:58:16.880 --> 3:58:18.880]  That's probably what we should do.
[3:58:18.880 --> 3:58:21.880]  Folks, I want to thank you so much for joining me today.
[3:58:21.880 --> 3:58:22.880]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
