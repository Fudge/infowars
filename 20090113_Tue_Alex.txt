[00:00:04.901 --> 00:00:09.744]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.744 --> 00:00:11.326]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.326 --> 00:00:12.887]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.887 --> 00:00:17.070]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.834]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.834 --> 00:00:24.095]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:24.095 --> 00:00:24.715]  Welcome.
[00:00:24.715 --> 00:00:29.318]  It is the 13th day of January 2009.
[00:00:29.318 --> 00:00:32.721]  I am Jason Burbess, sitting in for Alex Jones this week.
[00:00:32.721 --> 00:00:34.282]  And we got tons of news for you.
[00:00:36.476 --> 00:00:38.837]  Of course, Bernanke wants more bank bailouts.
[00:00:38.837 --> 00:00:39.557]  We're going to get to that.
[00:00:39.557 --> 00:00:44.498]  In fact, Obama's supposed to address the nation on the bailouts today.
[00:00:44.498 --> 00:00:47.299]  And that's going to be a story for later.
[00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:50.180]  We're also going to play this columnist.
[00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.621]  I believe it's, what's his name, Blankley.
[00:00:53.621 --> 00:00:54.361]  Tony Blankley.
[00:00:54.361 --> 00:00:56.162]  He's out of the Washington Times.
[00:00:56.162 --> 00:01:03.784]  And he's been parading around in the media saying that a draft is coming back, much like Rahm Emanuel, new staff of Obama.
[00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.392]  And not only has he been saying it, but he said it wasn't going to be under the Bush administration.
[00:01:10.392 --> 00:01:15.834]  We're going to play the clip from 2007 when he was on MSNBC with Pat Buchanan, saying it was coming, it was coming.
[00:01:15.834 --> 00:01:27.638]  Well, he's releasing a book, I believe, today, and it's called Grits, and it's all about how we need to bring back conscription, and Fox & Friends gave it a warm reception today, don't you worry.
[00:01:27.638 --> 00:01:33.901]  It might have been yesterday, but boy, they, you know what, conscription's a great idea, let's just bring back the draft, we're going to invade Pakistan, whoopee!
[00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:40.317]  So we're going to be playing those clips for you, but before I forget, I didn't plug it until so late in the show yesterday.
[00:01:41.511 --> 00:01:45.314]  Alex Jones' Tyranny Crusher 1 Bullhorn is over at eBay.
[00:01:45.314 --> 00:01:47.356]  Even if you're not going to bid on it, go check it out.
[00:01:47.356 --> 00:01:49.618]  This is a piece of history, folks.
[00:01:49.618 --> 00:01:54.562]  I believe it's just above 47 G's right now, which is just a great contribution.
[00:01:54.562 --> 00:01:56.144]  We love all our listeners.
[00:01:56.144 --> 00:02:00.828]  But it's really going to go to help bring this office even bigger and better.
[00:02:00.828 --> 00:02:03.430]  And I'm telling you, folks, it is a big office.
[00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:04.951]  I'm tempted to come down here and
[00:02:06.132 --> 00:02:07.913]  Just move right into one of the offices, really.
[00:02:07.913 --> 00:02:09.594]  I'm out here most of the time, anyway.
[00:02:09.594 --> 00:02:10.414]  I don't leave until late.
[00:02:10.414 --> 00:02:11.355]  I get here pretty early.
[00:02:11.355 --> 00:02:13.396]  I think I beat most of the staff here today.
[00:02:13.396 --> 00:02:14.277]  It's unbelievable.
[00:02:14.277 --> 00:02:17.298]  But anyway, Tierney Crusher 1, I mean, it really is a piece of history.
[00:02:17.298 --> 00:02:19.600]  Alex, you know, has bullhorned the elite, the media.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.322]  I think this is the same bullhorn he got Geraldo with.
[00:02:23.322 --> 00:02:27.264]  I think it's got two Bilderbergs under its belt, Scanner Darkly.
[00:02:27.264 --> 00:02:29.125]  I mean, what else could you ask for?
[00:02:29.125 --> 00:02:34.228]  And it's the one that got cut by the MSNBC guy that you can see up on the web right now.
[00:02:37.165 --> 00:02:41.746]  All right, so we might as well talk a little bailout, a little Obama policy.
[00:02:41.746 --> 00:02:44.587]  I mean, I know I've been going Obama crazy, but it's hard not to.
[00:02:44.587 --> 00:02:46.407]  It's all the news is about, number one.
[00:02:46.407 --> 00:02:47.488]  And we're so close.
[00:02:47.488 --> 00:02:52.869]  We're now literally one week away from him being sworn in.
[00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:53.769]  Here's some news for you.
[00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:59.631]  John Kerry's gold-plated consolation prize at MSNBC.com and New York Times.
[00:03:00.782 --> 00:03:04.544]  Well, he's the head of the Foreign Relations Committee.
[00:03:04.544 --> 00:03:05.784]  That shouldn't be a shock to people.
[00:03:05.784 --> 00:03:10.886]  John Kerry was put into place in 2004 to stage a loss to George Bush.
[00:03:10.886 --> 00:03:12.087]  He actually won, folks.
[00:03:12.087 --> 00:03:12.987]  That's right.
[00:03:12.987 --> 00:03:15.288]  If you didn't know, John Kerry won in 2004.
[00:03:15.288 --> 00:03:15.868]  He did.
[00:03:15.868 --> 00:03:17.609]  He didn't want a recount, though.
[00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:22.050]  He didn't want to tell you about Diebold and other machines rigging the election for the GOP.
[00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.291]  Why?
[00:03:22.291 --> 00:03:25.312]  Well, number one, he is related to Bush on both ends.
[00:03:25.312 --> 00:03:27.913]  He's a distant cousin on the mother and father side.
[00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.261]  They both went to college together out of Yale, two years apart.
[00:03:32.261 --> 00:03:33.301]  Not a shocker there either.
[00:03:33.301 --> 00:03:35.021]  And, of course, they were both in Skull & Bones.
[00:03:35.021 --> 00:03:35.781]  In fact, you know what?
[00:03:35.781 --> 00:03:37.442]  Those clips we're going to pull up.
[00:03:37.442 --> 00:03:44.903]  I'll pull up both the MSNBC, George Bush, Tim Russert, Skull & Bones, and the John Kerry, Tim Russert, Skull & Bones.
[00:03:44.903 --> 00:03:49.064]  And they both kind of... So secret, I can't talk about it.
[00:03:49.064 --> 00:03:51.065]  And then John Kerry's like, well, I'm not going to tell anything.
[00:03:51.065 --> 00:03:53.005]  It's a secret.
[00:03:53.005 --> 00:03:55.946]  So, you know, four years later, he's now part of the administration.
[00:03:55.946 --> 00:03:57.166]  And you know that the powers that be
[00:03:58.371 --> 00:04:01.512]  And these guys, which are like, you know, mid-level gangsters, really.
[00:04:01.512 --> 00:04:02.612]  These guys are like the captains.
[00:04:02.612 --> 00:04:06.133]  They're like, hey man, you're the head of the Foreign Relations Committee in a few years.
[00:04:06.133 --> 00:04:08.153]  There's some real decisions to be made there.
[00:04:08.153 --> 00:04:10.154]  You can make a big difference.
[00:04:10.154 --> 00:04:11.314]  And John Kerry's like, you know what?
[00:04:11.314 --> 00:04:12.374]  I can make a big difference.
[00:04:12.374 --> 00:04:13.575]  I'll throw the election.
[00:04:13.575 --> 00:04:15.035]  Sounds great.
[00:04:15.035 --> 00:04:17.756]  So, John Kerry on the Obama team.
[00:04:17.756 --> 00:04:17.836]  Yay!
[00:04:21.778 --> 00:04:28.880]  Newsweek, of course, reporting that Obama's not going to give up any of the powers that were given to the executive branch after 9-11.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.741]  This is called Obama's Cheney Dilemma.
[00:04:32.741 --> 00:04:38.702]  Basically, they say, oh, Cheney was so tyrannical and power-hungry, but he got all these powers and they're good for Obama.
[00:04:38.702 --> 00:04:41.083]  So, Obama, don't just give them up yet.
[00:04:41.083 --> 00:04:45.524]  And by the way, we know you're going to close Guantanamo, but you've got to do something with all those guys.
[00:04:45.524 --> 00:04:46.544]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:04:46.544 --> 00:04:48.665]  I am Jason Bermas, InfoWars.com.
[00:05:01.334 --> 00:05:09.415]  How many times have you been in the dark looking for a flashlight, only to find the one that you have is broken, the batteries are dead, or it's just not bright enough?
[00:05:09.415 --> 00:05:11.016]  You need the Paclite!
[00:05:11.016 --> 00:05:19.237]  The Paclite is the longest-lasting flashlight on the market, and simply snaps onto any 9-volt battery, and uses two high-powered LED lights.
[00:05:19.237 --> 00:05:22.798]  It's small enough to carry in your pocket, car, garage, and home.
[00:05:22.798 --> 00:05:27.619]  The Paclite can survive severe impact, be frozen solid, and still work flawlessly.
[00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:28.879]  The Paclite is so durable.
[00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:34.003]  Soldiers overseas rely on them, and has been featured in the New York Times and Backpacker Magazine.
[00:05:34.003 --> 00:05:38.667]  The PackLite comes with a 25-year warranty, and prices start at just $12.99.
[00:05:38.667 --> 00:05:45.653]  To learn more and see for yourself just how incredible this small flashlight can be, visit 9voltlite.com.
[00:05:45.653 --> 00:05:49.236]  That address again is 9voltlite.com.
[00:05:49.236 --> 00:05:50.657]  Or, call us today at 877-715-7000.
[00:05:54.359 --> 00:05:54.699]  4448.
[00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:59.141]  That's 877-715-4448.
[00:05:59.141 --> 00:06:06.643]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[00:06:06.643 --> 00:06:07.963]  And we knew what to do.
[00:06:07.963 --> 00:06:09.944]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:06:09.944 --> 00:06:16.986]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:06:16.986 --> 00:06:22.147]  Whitman, EPA Director on the 18th, made a statement.
[00:06:23.137 --> 00:06:25.879]  That the air was safe to breathe.
[00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:32.982]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:06:32.982 --> 00:06:36.164]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:06:36.164 --> 00:06:41.927]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[00:06:41.927 --> 00:06:45.009]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:51.993]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD
[00:07:00.562 --> 00:07:01.462]  You worry.
[00:07:01.462 --> 00:07:03.523]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[00:07:03.523 --> 00:07:06.163]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[00:07:06.163 --> 00:07:08.284]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity.
[00:07:08.284 --> 00:07:09.904]  Your answer may be at hand.
[00:07:09.904 --> 00:07:13.485]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[00:07:13.485 --> 00:07:18.726]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[00:07:18.726 --> 00:07:22.707]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[00:07:22.707 --> 00:07:23.987]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[00:07:24.389 --> 00:07:27.291]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[00:07:27.291 --> 00:07:30.734]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[00:07:30.734 --> 00:07:39.401]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[00:07:39.401 --> 00:07:44.225]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.

[00:07:58.260 --> 00:07:58.981]  Starvation?
[00:07:58.981 --> 00:08:01.622]  Impossible!
[00:08:01.622 --> 00:08:04.304]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk!
[00:08:04.304 --> 00:08:10.649]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network!
[00:08:10.649 --> 00:08:11.850]  Alright folks, we are back.
[00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:12.870]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:17.293]  I am Jason Bermas, filmmaker of Lose Change, Final Cut, and of course Fabled Enemies.
[00:08:17.293 --> 00:08:20.476]  You can get both of those at InfoWars.com right now.
[00:08:20.476 --> 00:08:21.516]  We have some guests on later.
[00:08:21.516 --> 00:08:24.198]  We're going to have Larry Pratt on, Gun Owners of America.
[00:08:25.399 --> 00:08:35.350]  The top of the hour at 1 o'clock and then we're going to talk about this food raid issue with Jonas Stoltzfus and Maurice Thompson from 2 to 3, so stay tuned for that.
[00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:39.154]  But right now we're talking about this Obama appointment.
[00:08:40.152 --> 00:08:41.753]  They're also saying it's a Clinton appointment.
[00:08:41.753 --> 00:08:43.613]  He'll be Clinton's lead inquisitor.
[00:08:43.613 --> 00:08:46.094]  Yes, because it's all the same team, you know.
[00:08:46.094 --> 00:08:49.395]  Obama was joking about putting Hillary on the administration.
[00:08:49.395 --> 00:08:59.278]  David Gergen called it when he said that, you know, oh, they're probably discussing whether or not she's going to get Secretary of State or another position when they ran off to the Bilderberg meeting.
[00:08:59.278 --> 00:09:00.558]  Well, they're not really discussing it.
[00:09:00.558 --> 00:09:02.659]  The powers that be are discussing it with them.
[00:09:02.739 --> 00:09:04.320]  Well, what would you feel more comfortable in?
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:09.464]  I mean, do you feel like you're going to be able to lie to the people three, four times a week?
[00:09:09.464 --> 00:09:13.066]  Obama, you've already got to do it about six days a week, but what do you think, Hillary?
[00:09:13.066 --> 00:09:14.447]  Oh, she's up to the task.
[00:09:14.447 --> 00:09:15.227]  Let's do it.
[00:09:15.227 --> 00:09:18.530]  And then internationalist John Kerry, because that's what he is, Foreign Relations Committee.
[00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:23.193]  I mean, come on, these guys are all CFR, which is the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:09:23.193 --> 00:09:24.454]  Do you think there's an overlap there?
[00:09:25.439 --> 00:09:26.180]  Oh, and you know what?
[00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:31.484]  I gotta have Erin bring me in that one article I almost forgot.
[00:09:31.484 --> 00:09:36.889]  I believe the person that Obama has chosen for the environment is calling for global governance.
[00:09:36.889 --> 00:09:41.552]  And of course she's not only calling for global governance, she's doing so under the guise of global warming.
[00:09:41.552 --> 00:09:44.595]  I'm so glad we talked about that yesterday and the carbon credits.
[00:09:44.595 --> 00:09:47.838]  I believe that's out of the Washington Times is even reporting it.
[00:09:47.838 --> 00:09:49.159]  The Washington Times.
[00:09:50.216 --> 00:09:59.885]  You know what, I'm going to grab that article, but first I want to show you how interrelated Bush and Kerry are.
[00:09:59.885 --> 00:10:04.029]  Both of them, again, they're skull and bones men, so let's play both clips.
[00:10:04.029 --> 00:10:06.171]  Let's play Bush and then Kerry.
[00:10:06.171 --> 00:10:09.674]  You were both in Skull and Bones, the secret society.
[00:10:09.674 --> 00:10:11.136]  It's so secret we can't talk about it.
[00:10:11.136 --> 00:10:12.237]  What does that mean for America?
[00:10:13.629 --> 00:10:15.250]  The conspiracy theorists are going to go wild.
[00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:16.270]  I'm sure they are.
[00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:16.630]  I don't know.
[00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:17.371]  I haven't seen the web.
[00:10:17.371 --> 00:10:17.591]  Number 322?
[00:10:17.591 --> 00:10:28.396]  I don't even think... Skull and Bones, a secret society at Yale.
[00:10:28.396 --> 00:10:29.837]  What does that tell us?
[00:10:29.837 --> 00:10:32.818]  Uh, not much because it's a secret.
[00:10:32.818 --> 00:10:34.039]  Is there a secret handshake?
[00:10:34.039 --> 00:10:35.059]  Is there a secret code?
[00:10:35.059 --> 00:10:38.941]  I wish there were something secret I could manifest.
[00:10:38.941 --> 00:10:39.781]  322, a secret number?
[00:10:39.781 --> 00:10:41.262]  There are all kinds of secrets.
[00:10:42.014 --> 00:10:49.607]  There are all kinds of secrets, like, though, that I'll be throwing the election for George Bush, and I'll be the head of the Foreign Relations Committee in about four years.
[00:10:49.607 --> 00:10:52.992]  So, Tim, if you're still around, we'll be talking... Oh, that's right, you're not still around.
[00:10:52.992 --> 00:10:53.333]  Yikes.
[00:10:57.352 --> 00:10:59.413]  Well, it really doesn't matter.
[00:10:59.413 --> 00:11:02.535]  We've got to get that Global Governance article in here so I can just show you.
[00:11:02.535 --> 00:11:04.556]  Obama doesn't seem to think it's a problem.
[00:11:04.556 --> 00:11:08.538]  When it was exposed, she was immediately pulled off their little Global Governance website.
[00:11:08.538 --> 00:11:11.459]  See, this is about world government.
[00:11:11.459 --> 00:11:12.320]  Haven't you heard?
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.981]  He's the world president.
[00:11:13.981 --> 00:11:14.761]  That's what everybody's saying.
[00:11:14.761 --> 00:11:16.222]  He's on the cover of the Rolling Stone.
[00:11:16.222 --> 00:11:17.642]  He's a rock star.
[00:11:17.642 --> 00:11:18.423]  He's not a president.
[00:11:23.578 --> 00:11:25.260]  Bernanke, more bailouts needed.
[00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:26.942]  This is off of CNNMoney.com.
[00:11:26.942 --> 00:11:41.140]  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said Tuesday that President-elect Barack Obama's proposed fiscal stimulus package could help the economy, but he added that the additional bailouts of financial institutions may also be needed to bring about a sustained economy.
[00:11:42.614 --> 00:11:43.495]  My God.
[00:11:43.495 --> 00:11:50.738]  See, the 800 billion plan isn't enough, and the analogy he makes at the end is just totally ridiculous.
[00:11:50.738 --> 00:11:53.440]  It's basically just like, give me your money and don't ask about it.
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.661]  You ready?
[00:11:54.661 --> 00:12:01.845]  It's good advice if, in general, if there's a fire burning, you try to put it out first, then you think about the fire code.
[00:12:01.845 --> 00:12:07.748]  So that basically means, let's not think about any of the laws, let us steal absolutely everything.
[00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:09.741]  Absolutely everything.
[00:12:09.741 --> 00:12:13.423]  And what they're going to do is they're going to bail more banks out.
[00:12:13.423 --> 00:12:16.005]  They're going to give more infrastructure to the government.
[00:12:16.005 --> 00:12:30.275]  And he says in this article also that they need to, the chairman said it was also clear that there need to be changes in the regulation of financial institutions both in the United States and in coordination with governments around the world.
[00:12:30.275 --> 00:12:31.916]  It's a world banking system.
[00:12:31.916 --> 00:12:38.221]  It's under criminal, elitist bankers, international bankers from other countries.
[00:12:39.292 --> 00:12:40.453]  But you know what?
[00:12:40.453 --> 00:12:42.854]  We don't mind.
[00:12:42.854 --> 00:12:52.860]  We're just going to sit back on our new Obama Pepsis and kick it.
[00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:55.661]  This is out of Newsweek, by the way.
[00:12:55.661 --> 00:12:59.284]  This is back, I believe, right before the election.
[00:12:59.284 --> 00:13:01.145]  We need a bank of the world.
[00:13:01.145 --> 00:13:07.548]  The financial crisis is global and only an international central bank can deal with it.
[00:13:07.548 --> 00:13:08.349]  That's the headline.
[00:13:09.926 --> 00:13:15.850]  The idea of such an institution would have been a political non-starter before the current debacle.
[00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:28.498]  The crisis of the last several decades, the Latin America debt meltdown in the early 80s, the stock market crash in 87, the savings and loan collapse of the early 90s, the Asian financial blow-up of the late 1990s, blah blah blah, nonsense.
[00:13:28.498 --> 00:13:31.300]  They've engineered this.
[00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:36.523]  They've brought in things like the IMF and World Bank as precursors to what they have planned.
[00:13:37.782 --> 00:13:38.763]  There it is, right there.
[00:13:38.763 --> 00:13:41.304]  I know we're not on air, but maybe in the tape.
[00:13:41.304 --> 00:13:43.125]  It's unbelievable.
[00:13:43.125 --> 00:13:44.045]  Unbelievable.
[00:13:44.045 --> 00:13:55.211]  So now today, and in fact, listeners, I know I gave a big, big, big ups to BL for all this footage that he sent, and I want to do that again, but we could really use some footage of whatever he says today.
[00:13:55.211 --> 00:14:02.074]  If you can get the whole thing on C-SPAN or MSNBC, please put it to DVD, record it, and send it to us.
[00:14:02.074 --> 00:14:04.435]  We need it.
[00:14:04.435 --> 00:14:07.237]  Obama is going to talk about the bailout for the first time today.
[00:14:08.078 --> 00:14:08.538]  Interesting.
[00:14:08.538 --> 00:14:16.442]  President-elect Barack Obama will go to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to meet with Senate Democrats and make his case for how he wants to spend the second half of the $700 billion ballot.
[00:14:16.442 --> 00:14:19.183]  See, they're still talking about a $700 billion ballot.
[00:14:19.183 --> 00:14:20.704]  It's in the trillions.
[00:14:20.704 --> 00:14:24.285]  Bernanke's saying we're taking more.
[00:14:24.285 --> 00:14:24.905]  I mean, really.
[00:14:24.905 --> 00:14:28.947]  I don't even know if it's going to be a finite amount of money.
[00:14:28.947 --> 00:14:30.308]  I mean, if you really think about it.
[00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:37.906]  If they loan out enough of it, they could probably just loan out more than they have or they're supposed to again and again and again.
[00:14:37.906 --> 00:14:46.034]  Maybe it'll be a hundred trillion before it's all over and we'll all have to give up our first born.
[00:14:46.034 --> 00:14:52.740]  Or they'll make the excuse like China that we're so strained that we're only going to have one child births.
[00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:55.142]  So instead of our first born being taken, that's all you get.
[00:14:55.142 --> 00:14:56.383]  Then you get sterilized.
[00:14:56.383 --> 00:14:56.984]  It'll be delicious.
[00:14:59.175 --> 00:15:09.599]  You know, one of these guys bringing the bailout to us, who I constantly see parading around the news, is a guy named Barney Frank.
[00:15:09.599 --> 00:15:10.519]  Alright?
[00:15:10.519 --> 00:15:20.463]  Now, Barney Frank, I am utterly no fan of, and I kind of alluded to it yesterday on the show, that I didn't care for him or his antics.
[00:15:20.463 --> 00:15:21.203]  And this is why.
[00:15:21.203 --> 00:15:23.224]  In the late 80s,
[00:15:24.488 --> 00:15:44.302]  and i'm gonna read you an article from time magazine and it's just it's a disgusting article uh... in the late eighties he was caught running a underage male brothel out of his washington dc home with his uh... male prostitute boyfriend what's his name uh... goby yeah i think it's something going so mister goby
[00:15:45.143 --> 00:15:50.693]  Was a drug addicted male prostitute and of course being paid for sex by Barney Frank.
[00:15:50.693 --> 00:15:54.660]  But Frank was letting him run a brothel there and a lot of these kids were not 18.
[00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:55.702]  Let me repeat that.
[00:15:55.702 --> 00:15:56.543]  These kids were not 18.
[00:15:58.536 --> 00:16:07.846]  And he got caught, and he basically threatened other members of the House and other political elites in Washington on the floor and said, hey, if I go down, you're going down with me.
[00:16:07.846 --> 00:16:09.148]  I believe he was a Republican at the time.
[00:16:09.148 --> 00:16:11.831]  Of course, he switched over to Democrat.
[00:16:11.831 --> 00:16:13.533]  But he survived the scandal.
[00:16:13.533 --> 00:16:15.255]  And this is why he survived the scandal.
[00:16:15.255 --> 00:16:19.640]  Because, number one, we are utterly retarded as a populace.
[00:16:20.999 --> 00:16:23.342]  And articles like this one in Time.
[00:16:23.342 --> 00:16:25.705]  A skeleton in Barney's closet.
[00:16:25.705 --> 00:16:27.487]  A skeleton in Barney's closet?
[00:16:27.487 --> 00:16:28.048]  No.
[00:16:28.048 --> 00:16:30.211]  How about a young boy in Barney's closet?
[00:16:30.211 --> 00:16:33.194]  I mean, honestly.
[00:16:33.194 --> 00:16:33.715]  A skeleton?
[00:16:33.715 --> 00:16:34.856]  This is a skeleton?
[00:16:34.856 --> 00:16:36.518]  No, it's a little more than a skeleton.
[00:16:36.518 --> 00:16:38.300]  The issue isn't that he's a homosexual.
[00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:38.981]  It's that, uh...
[00:16:40.509 --> 00:16:44.633]  God, you know, it's unbelievable that you're having sex with underage kids.
[00:16:44.633 --> 00:16:52.200]  It even goes into another Ohio Republican, Donald Lukens, who got convicted in May of that year of having sex with a 16-year-old girl.
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:54.262]  Again, having sex with kids.
[00:16:54.262 --> 00:16:56.083]  And that's 16.
[00:16:56.083 --> 00:16:57.685]  These guys are into sicker.
[00:16:57.685 --> 00:16:59.266]  So anyway, he gets caught.
[00:16:59.266 --> 00:17:03.410]  Time Magazine puts out, a skeleton in Barney Frank's closet.
[00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:05.092]  Now, later on, when Tom Foley
[00:17:06.112 --> 00:17:08.414]  He was basically the head of the CPS for the government.
[00:17:08.414 --> 00:17:15.379]  He's going on MSNBC, applauding Chris Hansen and his little debacles, catching all these other pedophiles.
[00:17:16.638 --> 00:17:22.282]  And he gets caught inappropriately communicating with a 16-year-old boy, Paige.
[00:17:22.282 --> 00:17:24.804]  Well, God knows what else he's up to.
[00:17:24.804 --> 00:17:29.328]  This is what Representative Barney Frank has to say about it, alright?
[00:17:29.328 --> 00:17:35.212]  He, number one, he gets to comment, but him and the political pundits don't ever comment that it's a young boy.
[00:17:35.212 --> 00:17:36.753]  It's a gay issue.
[00:17:36.753 --> 00:17:40.376]  They're like, um, da-da-da-da-da-da-da.
[00:17:40.376 --> 00:17:40.756]  Let's see.
[00:17:41.917 --> 00:17:44.861]  Was it common knowledge in Washington that Foley was gay?
[00:17:44.861 --> 00:17:47.485]  Excuse me, he's not gay, he's a pedophile.
[00:17:47.485 --> 00:17:48.366]  Alright?
[00:17:48.366 --> 00:17:49.608]  Both sides of the aisle knew.
[00:17:49.608 --> 00:17:51.431]  It was an open secret.
[00:17:51.431 --> 00:17:56.718]  Foley would, uh, get people in Florida thinking that he was up north, but that was not the case.
[00:17:57.319 --> 00:18:06.021]  Once at a Congressional Christmas party at the White House, my ex-boyfriend Herb went up to Foley and was with a female date and said to him, why don't you get a real date?
[00:18:06.021 --> 00:18:07.662]  Foley didn't say anything.
[00:18:07.662 --> 00:18:16.284]  It's funny how a lot of gay male politicians in Washington came with male dates at these events during the Clinton years, but then showed up with females under Bush.
[00:18:16.284 --> 00:18:17.585]  Come on.
[00:18:17.585 --> 00:18:19.505]  Give me a break.
[00:18:19.505 --> 00:18:23.466]  See, again, they make it into a gay issue.
[00:18:23.466 --> 00:18:25.607]  That was back in 2006 he made those comments.
[00:18:26.525 --> 00:18:27.666]  Uh, it's not a gay issue.
[00:18:27.666 --> 00:18:35.192]  It's a, uh, issue of the fact that you're pedophiles and you should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
[00:18:35.192 --> 00:18:38.755]  And then people can't believe that they would be this evil.
[00:18:38.755 --> 00:18:41.378]  Well, here's just a light evil story I pulled up out of the news.
[00:18:42.756 --> 00:18:57.141]  You know, there's plenty of cases of the serial killers, you know, having kids chained up in their basements, or women chained up in their basements, or there was that case out of Syracuse where this guy would keep them for years in this basement and rape them continuously and then eventually kill them and he had a family upstairs.
[00:18:58.061 --> 00:19:01.882]  Here's just a light one to prove, you know, how sick people can be.
[00:19:01.882 --> 00:19:04.844]  Man accused of selling daughter for cash and beer.
[00:19:04.844 --> 00:19:06.644]  And this is out of the Associated Press.
[00:19:06.644 --> 00:19:07.645]  Okay?
[00:19:07.645 --> 00:19:09.325]  This is out of California, by the way.
[00:19:09.325 --> 00:19:19.089]  Police have arrested a Greenfield man for allegedly arranging to sell his 14-year-old daughter into marriage in exchange for $16,000, 100 cases of beer, and several cases of meat.
[00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:30.054]  Police said that they only learned the deal after the 36-year-old man went to them to get his daughter back because payment wasn't made as promised.
[00:19:30.054 --> 00:19:32.035]  So this guy's not only evil, he's an idiot.
[00:19:32.035 --> 00:19:34.756]  All right, we're going to come back.
[00:19:34.756 --> 00:19:44.461]  We're going to play these conscription clips where Tom Blankley of the Washington Times is telling you, hey, we need a draft so we can invade Pakistan.
[00:19:44.461 --> 00:19:45.381]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:19:45.381 --> 00:19:47.643]  I'm Jason Bermas, Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:19:54.189 --> 00:19:54.510]  We're good to go.
[00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:03.072]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:20:03.072 --> 00:20:08.436]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:20:08.436 --> 00:20:10.037]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:20:10.037 --> 00:20:18.444]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:20:18.444 --> 00:20:24.169]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:20:24.329 --> 00:20:26.170]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:28.471]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:20:28.471 --> 00:20:32.874]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:20:32.874 --> 00:20:35.115]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:20:35.115 --> 00:20:42.699]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[00:21:01.109 --> 00:21:05.173]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:21:05.173 --> 00:21:11.079]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[00:21:11.079 --> 00:21:12.180]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:16.224]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:21:16.864 --> 00:21:30.210]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:36.293]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[00:21:36.293 --> 00:21:42.176]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[00:21:55.608 --> 00:21:57.930]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:57.930 --> 00:22:07.298]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:22:07.298 --> 00:22:08.960]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:22:09.935 --> 00:22:11.476]  But who is the enemy?
[00:22:11.476 --> 00:22:12.276]  Bin Laden.
[00:22:12.276 --> 00:22:13.276]  This is his ammo.
[00:22:13.276 --> 00:22:14.637]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:22:14.637 --> 00:22:16.637]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:22:16.637 --> 00:22:23.780]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:24.260]  Some U.S.
[00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:29.902]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:22:30.602 --> 00:22:34.125]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:22:34.125 --> 00:22:36.266]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:23:00.442 --> 00:23:03.966]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[00:23:03.966 --> 00:23:05.888]  Now, going green can save money.
[00:23:05.888 --> 00:23:11.453]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.
[00:23:11.453 --> 00:23:19.161]  The Renaissance Charger uses a new revolutionary battery charging technology that effectively extends the life of new batteries and gives new life to used batteries.

[00:24:21.098 --> 00:24:23.842]  Obama climate czar has socialist ties.
[00:24:23.842 --> 00:24:25.866]  This is out of the Washington Times.
[00:24:25.866 --> 00:24:31.995]  Until last week, Carl M. Browner, President-elect Obama's pick as global warming czar.
[00:24:31.995 --> 00:24:33.798]  Oh, we need a czar for global warming.
[00:24:33.798 --> 00:24:34.719]  That's how real it is.
[00:24:37.349 --> 00:24:42.952]  Was listed as one of the 14 leaders of a socialist group's commission for a sustainable world society.
[00:24:42.952 --> 00:24:44.974]  See, it's always about sustainability.
[00:24:44.974 --> 00:24:56.421]  Just like in Joe Biden's Wall Street Journal article from the 90s, How I Love to Learn the... I'm sorry, How I Learned to Love the New World Order, where he says that overpopulation is a problem.
[00:24:56.421 --> 00:24:59.643]  They're saying, world sustainable society.
[00:24:59.643 --> 00:24:59.763]  Hmm.
[00:25:01.883 --> 00:25:07.145]  Which calls for global governance and says rich countries must shrink their economies to address climate change.
[00:25:07.145 --> 00:25:09.366]  Let me repeat that.
[00:25:09.366 --> 00:25:16.929]  The Sustainable World Society which calls for global governance and says rich countries must shrink their economies to address climate change.
[00:25:16.929 --> 00:25:19.370]  See, this is his global warming czar.
[00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:20.590]  We're back in the Soviet Union.
[00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:21.511]  We need czars.
[00:25:22.847 --> 00:25:34.631]  By Thursday, Mr. Browner's name and biography had been removed from the Socialist International's webpage, though a photo of her speaking June 30th to the group's Congress in Greece was still available.
[00:25:34.631 --> 00:25:44.214]  Socialist International, an umbrella group for many of the world's social democratic political parties, such as Britain's Labour Party, said it supports socialism and is harshly critical of U.S.
[00:25:44.214 --> 00:25:44.714]  policies.
[00:25:45.796 --> 00:25:51.422]  The group's commission for a sustainable world society, the organization's action arm on climate change.
[00:25:51.422 --> 00:25:54.405]  See, it's not global warming, even though she's the global warming czar.
[00:25:54.405 --> 00:25:55.647]  It's all about climate change.
[00:25:55.647 --> 00:25:57.549]  That broadens it out a bit.
[00:25:57.549 --> 00:26:01.473]  You know, they're allowed to do a lot more with just climate change.
[00:26:01.473 --> 00:26:02.334]  It's all okay.
[00:26:02.334 --> 00:26:03.175]  It sounds better.
[00:26:03.175 --> 00:26:04.316]  Climate change.
[00:26:04.316 --> 00:26:04.576]  Yes.
[00:26:05.939 --> 00:26:12.404]  Says the developed world must reduce consumption and commit to binding and punitive limits on greenhouse gas emissions.
[00:26:12.404 --> 00:26:23.631]  Mr. Obama, who has said action on climate change would be a priority in his administration, tapped Mrs. Browner last month to fill a new position as White House Coordinator of Climate and Energy Policies.
[00:26:23.631 --> 00:26:30.456]  Yes, she's the White House Coordinator on Climate and Energy Policies, so she'll also know when to jack up your NYSEG bill.
[00:26:30.456 --> 00:26:31.237]  That's really nice of her.
[00:26:31.237 --> 00:26:31.397]  Great.
[00:26:31.897 --> 00:26:35.219]  The appointment does not need Senate confirmation.
[00:26:35.219 --> 00:26:42.403]  Mr. Obama's transition team said Mrs. Browner's membership in the organization is not a problem and that it brings experience in U.S.
[00:26:42.403 --> 00:26:45.265]  policymaking in her new role.
[00:26:45.265 --> 00:26:52.630]  The Commission for Sustainable World Society includes world leaders from a variety of political parties, including British Prime Minister Gordon Brown.
[00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:52.910]  Okay.
[00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:54.853]  I need you to pull up another clip.
[00:26:54.853 --> 00:26:57.740]  Let's pull up Gordon Brown talking about the New World Order.
[00:26:57.740 --> 00:26:59.965]  Just type in Gordon Brown New World Order speech.
[00:26:59.965 --> 00:27:02.130]  This is before he was elected.
[00:27:03.326 --> 00:27:06.027]  And I'll let you know when you got the right one.
[00:27:06.027 --> 00:27:07.648]  It's about two and a half minutes long.
[00:27:07.648 --> 00:27:11.170]  He pumps in the term New World Order about a dozen times.
[00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:17.933]  And this guy is... I mean, it's on the cover of the newspapers there for Gordon Brown calling for a New World Order.
[00:27:17.933 --> 00:27:19.053]  That's it right there.
[00:27:19.053 --> 00:27:19.633]  That's it right there.
[00:27:19.633 --> 00:27:20.934]  Can we go right to that?
[00:27:20.934 --> 00:27:27.317]  Because these are the people that are on the World Sustainable Society that this lady is heavily involved in.
[00:27:27.317 --> 00:27:27.877]  Alright, play it up.
[00:27:30.425 --> 00:27:40.973]  All these new challenges are bringing together about the biggest restructuring we have ever seen, not just of the global economy, but of the global order as a whole.
[00:27:40.973 --> 00:27:50.501]  And 200 years ago, a famous British Foreign Secretary said that the new world had been called into existence to redress the balance of the old.
[00:27:50.501 --> 00:27:54.444]  In 1990, another old world ended, dominated by the Cold War,
[00:27:55.498 --> 00:27:59.540]  And people taught them in 1990 of a new world order.
[00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:02.421]  What they actually meant then was a new political order.
[00:28:02.421 --> 00:28:13.765]  And what was not foreseen then, but is obvious now from everything that we see and do, what we experience in every day of our life, is the sheer scale and speed and scope of globalisation.
[00:28:13.765 --> 00:28:17.347]  And it's only now that we can begin to understand that the world order
[00:28:18.007 --> 00:28:18.487]  We're good to go.
[00:28:40.163 --> 00:28:54.809]  I suggest that the countries that are going to succeed are those that combine flexibility, free trade, open markets, with proper stewardship of the environment and investment in education, infrastructure and innovation.
[00:28:54.809 --> 00:29:08.834]  And the question for us is how we meet and master all these challenges to ensure that Britain enhances its competitiveness in the process and realises what I believe is our destiny of success in this new world order.
[00:29:09.514 --> 00:29:14.916]  So, in conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, a new world is emerging.
[00:29:14.916 --> 00:29:23.539]  It is a new world order with significantly different and radically new challenges for the future.
[00:29:23.539 --> 00:29:28.301]  All right, well, uh, obviously I've made the term new world order up.
[00:29:28.301 --> 00:29:33.943]  And, uh, you know, the, uh, the head of Britain, he doesn't know anything about it.
[00:29:36.454 --> 00:29:37.134]  Oh man, you know what?
[00:29:37.134 --> 00:29:39.636]  I'm going to take your calls coming up in a few minutes.
[00:29:39.636 --> 00:29:42.617]  I really want to take some calls on topic.
[00:29:42.617 --> 00:29:51.362]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:29:51.362 --> 00:29:52.742]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.742 --> 00:29:55.284]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.284 --> 00:29:57.985]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.491 --> 00:30:08.334]  IonicZone.com has the best prices on commercial shock treatment ozone generators starting at $299.
[00:30:08.334 --> 00:30:15.276]  But did you know IonicZone.com also sells a water ozonator that's a must-have for anyone interested in good health?
[00:30:15.276 --> 00:30:15.997]  It's true.
[00:30:15.997 --> 00:30:24.760]  The IonicZone digital water ozonator features an air intake and can be fed dry air through the supplied air dryer or pure oxygen via an oxygen tank.
[00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:35.003]  Ozone-fortified water can be used to kill bacteria, sanitize food, produce, and eliminates bacteria in the mouth by gargling, which helps prevent bad breath and even heart disease.
[00:30:35.003 --> 00:30:42.005]  The optional ozone bidet attachment is used for personal hygiene, which can kill the bacteria down below that can lead to irritation.
[00:30:42.005 --> 00:30:45.226]  It's amazing what three atoms of oxygen can do!

[00:31:21.264 --> 00:31:25.226]  And the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[00:31:25.226 --> 00:31:28.627]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[00:31:28.627 --> 00:31:30.388]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[00:31:30.388 --> 00:31:36.530]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[00:32:01.625 --> 00:32:03.406]  Hello, I'm Steve Shank.
[00:32:03.406 --> 00:32:09.530]  For the past several months, folks have constantly asked me to give them the date as to when they should be finished stocking up on food.
[00:32:10.362 --> 00:32:20.971]  We've been so beaten up by stock market banking, housing and unemployment crashes that we're desensitized and frozen inactive like the frog being unknowingly cooked in gradually increasingly hot water.
[00:32:20.971 --> 00:32:21.932]  Well, snap out of it.
[00:32:21.932 --> 00:32:23.433]  We now have a deadline.
[00:32:23.433 --> 00:32:25.455]  Joe Biden said it's going to happen.
[00:32:25.455 --> 00:32:36.765]  Former Secretary of State Colin Powell went on CBS Meet the Press and pointed to about January 22nd as the time a major international incident would force the new president to make unpopular decisions.
[00:32:37.349 --> 00:32:43.493]  Well I take the general of this word and my best advice is to have your food in your possession prior to the inauguration.
[00:32:43.493 --> 00:32:48.916]  Contact efoodsdirect.com for your supplies prior to this deadline for disaster.
[00:32:48.916 --> 00:32:53.258]  Ask yourself is it better to have too much too soon or too little too late?
[00:32:53.258 --> 00:32:54.499]  Call 800-409-5633 or on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[00:33:17.887 --> 00:33:35.230]  Carol Browner named Obama's Global Climate Change Czar, Global Warming Czar, member of the World Sustainable Society, calling for global governance with such players as Gordon Brown at the helm.
[00:33:35.230 --> 00:33:37.191]  This is what the New World Order is.
[00:33:37.191 --> 00:33:42.712]  This is a total takeover of our economic, our foreign, and domestic policies.
[00:33:45.287 --> 00:33:47.628]  But you know, most people will tell you it's a kooky term.
[00:33:47.628 --> 00:33:48.388]  It doesn't exist.
[00:33:48.388 --> 00:33:52.130]  Except for when world leaders are talking about it.
[00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:53.831]  And they have to air it.
[00:33:53.831 --> 00:33:55.111]  I mean, John King knows about it.
[00:33:55.111 --> 00:33:56.852]  He talks about it on Colbert.
[00:33:56.852 --> 00:33:58.333]  Colbert is well aware of it, too.
[00:33:58.333 --> 00:34:02.495]  I mean, he's made some Secret Society references now that are just off the chain.
[00:34:04.992 --> 00:34:08.156]  So again, we have Obama today talking about the economic crisis.
[00:34:08.156 --> 00:34:15.165]  I'm sure he's going to talk about how he's behind Bernanke and they need to give even more money to the banks.
[00:34:15.165 --> 00:34:16.607]  Even more money to the banks.
[00:34:16.607 --> 00:34:20.331]  It's just going to sink the economy further and faster.
[00:34:20.331 --> 00:34:22.394]  And let's just hope.
[00:34:22.394 --> 00:34:23.495]  Let's hope and pray that
[00:34:25.359 --> 00:34:31.988]  This 21st or 22nd crisis that Colin Powell is talking about has already passed, because he was on a while back.
[00:34:31.988 --> 00:34:38.196]  I did get a couple text messages and emails that people felt that it was the economic crisis that he was talking about.
[00:34:41.122 --> 00:34:42.303]  Let's hope it's not a draft.
[00:34:42.303 --> 00:34:44.304]  Let's hope he's not planning on... Well, you know what?
[00:34:44.304 --> 00:34:47.166]  Biden's on that diplomatic mission to Pakistan.
[00:34:47.166 --> 00:34:49.167]  I really hope and pray it's not a draft.
[00:34:49.167 --> 00:34:55.431]  But, you know, speaking of the draft, that's a good segue in this before we take your calls, and we'll do that after these two clips.
[00:34:58.078 --> 00:35:07.720]  In 2007, this guy was promoting on MSNBC, this Blankly fellow, that we need to bring back a draft, but it won't be through the Bush administration.
[00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:10.360]  So we're going to play that clip first because now he has a book out.
[00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:13.341]  And remember, Raoul Manuel is talking about the same exact thing.
[00:35:13.341 --> 00:35:15.021]  Males 18 to 25.
[00:35:15.021 --> 00:35:21.962]  He also mentions in this that obesity and urban couch potatoes are hindering recruitment.
[00:35:21.962 --> 00:35:25.803]  So who knows, maybe this is also going to be a call to regulate what we can and can't eat.
[00:35:25.803 --> 00:35:27.043]  Alright, let's play the Buchanan clip.
[00:35:28.544 --> 00:35:34.592]  ...of the military draft should be considered, and has always been an option on the table.
[00:35:34.592 --> 00:35:44.123]  A Pentagon spokesman frankly rejected the idea today, saying that the military is giving the idea, quote, absolutely no consideration, unquote.
[00:35:44.964 --> 00:35:49.667]  But is it time to revive conscription for the first time since Richard Nixon?
[00:35:49.667 --> 00:35:57.771]  Back to discuss it are Democratic strategist, Stephanie Cutter, and editor of the Washington Times editorial page, Tony Blankley.
[00:35:57.771 --> 00:36:01.013]  Tony, uh, just seen me political year.
[00:36:01.013 --> 00:36:03.194]  Nobody's going to recommend a return to the draft.
[00:36:03.894 --> 00:36:08.038]  But is the draft a good idea, or is a partial draft a good idea?
[00:36:08.038 --> 00:36:10.500]  We got 5,000 troops in the Army.
[00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:17.387]  It is breaking, according to the Army Chief of Staff, on the basis of two small guerrilla wars.
[00:36:17.387 --> 00:36:18.608]  Now, is the U.S.
[00:36:18.608 --> 00:36:22.872]  Army big enough and strong enough to handle all the commitments this country's got?
[00:36:23.092 --> 00:36:28.793]  It's not going to happen on Bush's watch because it's not time for that debate to occur.
[00:36:28.793 --> 00:36:38.015]  But the military clearly is not big enough to do the job that's going to be required of it in a world that we live in today and into the foreseeable future.
[00:36:38.015 --> 00:36:42.596]  As you say, two small wars and we're almost tapped out as far as troops are concerned.
[00:36:42.596 --> 00:36:48.878]  You've got a real split in the Pentagon because they really believe in the volunteer force and I know a lot of people are in it.
[00:36:49.898 --> 00:36:54.561]  And the quality and the esprit de corps that comes from being volunteers is a tremendous value.
[00:36:54.561 --> 00:36:59.924]  In a high-tech army, you want people who are committed to a career, at least for many years, not just draftees coming in.
[00:36:59.924 --> 00:37:04.706]  So there's a huge argument for it, for keeping volunteer, except you can't get to the numbers.
[00:37:04.706 --> 00:37:15.372]  And I know there are some people, and I've talked with some, who are talking about the day is going to come when, as wonderful as our volunteer force is, we're going to have to supplement it with a conscript army.
[00:37:15.372 --> 00:37:15.892]  You agree with that?
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:19.001]  I don't know whether or not the day is going to come.
[00:37:19.001 --> 00:37:23.663]  I do agree that it would take an enormous amount of political will to get this done.
[00:37:23.663 --> 00:37:26.624]  And it'll take an enormous amount of time to build that political will.
[00:37:26.624 --> 00:37:32.527]  But we are facing a crisis in terms of... You know, the country should have think and go.
[00:37:32.527 --> 00:37:37.649]  But yeah, right there in 2007, he blatantly says it's not going to happen under this administration.
[00:37:37.649 --> 00:37:40.891]  Well, here comes the new administration and Fox and Friends to the rescue.
[00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:43.812]  Welcome back everyone, seven minutes before the top of the hour.
[00:37:43.812 --> 00:37:50.339]  Can America's power last forever and how do we achieve a new nationalism that puts our country's survival first?
[00:37:50.339 --> 00:37:53.982]  Those questions and more are addressed in a brand new book by Tony Blankley.
[00:37:53.982 --> 00:37:54.723]  It comes out today.
[00:37:54.723 --> 00:37:55.864]  It's called American Grit.
[00:37:55.864 --> 00:38:00.769]  What will it take for America to survive and win in the 21st century?
[00:38:00.769 --> 00:38:03.752]  And joining us for his first TV interview about the book is Tony Blankley.
[00:38:03.752 --> 00:38:04.432]  Tony, good morning to you.
[00:38:05.453 --> 00:38:06.695]  Good morning, thank you.
[00:38:06.695 --> 00:38:12.642]  You know, if you read some of the European papers, they're talking about America is finally in decline.
[00:38:12.642 --> 00:38:15.385]  They're getting what they've had coming to them all along.
[00:38:15.385 --> 00:38:16.006]  Do you believe that?
[00:38:17.495 --> 00:38:19.136]  Well, it could be so.
[00:38:19.136 --> 00:38:23.218]  We have it in our power not to be in decline, and that's what my book's about.
[00:38:23.218 --> 00:38:33.624]  I do believe that for the first time in our history, if we don't do a lot of things smart and tough, we could get overwhelmed by the rise of China, the rise of India, the rise of radical Islam.
[00:38:33.624 --> 00:38:35.645]  We've failed to exploit our energy.
[00:38:35.645 --> 00:38:40.088]  We're not paying enough attention to what our kids are learning.
[00:38:40.088 --> 00:38:45.371]  Bill Ayers is actually a senior person in guiding the curriculum design of America.
[00:38:45.371 --> 00:38:46.932]  That started just this last March.
[00:38:47.452 --> 00:38:57.878]  So, but we have it in our power, and I try to write some tough proposals for what we need to do so that our grandchildren live in a country strong enough to protect our freedoms just as we do.
[00:38:57.878 --> 00:39:03.462]  Yeah, Tony, your book's going to get a lot of attention because there are some controversial, bold suggestions.
[00:39:03.462 --> 00:39:12.347]  The first one, obviously, that caught my eye was that you were calling for a universal draft, which would mean that all 18-year-olds in America would have to serve for two years.
[00:39:13.703 --> 00:39:15.484]  Yes, look, I don't like it.
[00:39:15.484 --> 00:39:16.924]  I love the volunteer army.
[00:39:16.924 --> 00:39:20.566]  I've got a son who's a second lieutenant in the volunteer army.
[00:39:20.566 --> 00:39:25.888]  I know the young men and women who serve, they're the greatest young kids we've ever produced.
[00:39:25.888 --> 00:39:30.290]  But we don't have enough troops, and it's manifest that we don't by several magnitudes.
[00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:31.371]  For instance, when
[00:39:32.051 --> 00:39:33.232]  Cut it right there.
[00:39:33.232 --> 00:39:33.913]  Cut it right there.
[00:39:52.208 --> 00:39:55.109]  All right, see, Obama does want to go into Afghanistan.
[00:39:55.109 --> 00:39:57.871]  Just like I talked about yesterday, he's going to be repositioning the troops there.
[00:39:57.871 --> 00:39:59.811]  It's going to be a flux from Iraq into there.
[00:39:59.811 --> 00:40:01.892]  You're going to still see troops in Iraq, of course.
[00:40:01.892 --> 00:40:06.635]  But this guy has been calling for this... Oh my God.
[00:40:06.635 --> 00:40:09.736]  We're going to draft 18-year-old kids and we're going to put them to war.
[00:40:09.736 --> 00:40:10.556]  It's unbelievable.
[00:40:10.556 --> 00:40:11.677]  It's coming back.
[00:40:11.677 --> 00:40:12.897]  Rahm Emanuel is behind it.
[00:40:12.897 --> 00:40:13.818]  All right, let's take your calls.
[00:40:13.818 --> 00:40:14.958]  I promise I'll take your calls.
[00:40:14.958 --> 00:40:17.800]  I'll take a couple calls before the break.
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:20.001]  Let's go to Diane in New York.
[00:40:20.001 --> 00:40:20.821]  Diane, what's on your mind?
[00:40:22.243 --> 00:40:23.024]  Hello?
[00:40:23.024 --> 00:40:23.864]  Yes.
[00:40:23.864 --> 00:40:24.704]  Jason, I'm on the air?
[00:40:24.704 --> 00:40:25.065]  Okay.
[00:40:25.065 --> 00:40:25.405]  Yes.
[00:40:25.405 --> 00:40:26.305]  This is Diane.
[00:40:26.305 --> 00:40:27.626]  I'm with Real Change in New York.
[00:40:27.626 --> 00:40:29.126]  We're having an event.
[00:40:29.126 --> 00:40:35.950]  It's called the Global Meltdown Survival Clinic, and it is a free survival and preparedness clinic.
[00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:37.831]  The presenter is Eitan Edwards.
[00:40:37.831 --> 00:40:43.073]  He's Executive Director of the International Self-Reliance and Preparedness Network.
[00:40:43.073 --> 00:40:48.296]  Some people in New York are familiar with Eitan Edwards because he went on the radio shortly after 9-11.
[00:40:49.554 --> 00:40:57.600]  And he said that the air was not safe to breathe, and he got Mayor Giuliani very, very angry.
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:06.306]  And Ed Wilkes is going to discuss nuclear preparedness, what to do when there's no doctor, things like gardening and solar power, some things we can use right now.
[00:41:06.306 --> 00:41:07.407]  I hope you can come.
[00:41:07.407 --> 00:41:10.349]  I hope you'll be back in New York and you can come, but it is free to the public.
[00:41:10.349 --> 00:41:12.230]  Oh, what's the date on that?
[00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:15.793]  It's Sunday, January 25th, from 11am to 7.30pm.
[00:41:19.306 --> 00:41:19.787]  I don't know.
[00:41:32.352 --> 00:41:35.433]  The blurb afterwards says 9 Bleaker Street.
[00:41:35.433 --> 00:41:37.994]  Yes, WeAreChange.org is the website, I believe.
[00:41:37.994 --> 00:41:39.155]  Thanks for the call, Diane.
[00:41:39.155 --> 00:41:41.275]  WeAreChange events are just awesome.
[00:41:41.275 --> 00:41:43.736]  January 25th, be sure to go there.
[00:41:43.736 --> 00:41:46.737]  If you're in the city, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to make it.
[00:41:46.737 --> 00:41:49.819]  That's about a week after I get back, but that is a long drive.
[00:41:49.819 --> 00:41:51.199]  It's all about the weather.
[00:41:51.199 --> 00:41:54.020]  WeAreChange.org is just doing amazing things out there.
[00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:57.282]  We had Matthew Medina from WeAreChange San Antonio on yesterday.
[00:41:57.282 --> 00:42:00.483]  The New York Group with Luke Rudowski and others, of course.
[00:42:01.454 --> 00:42:02.975]  A great organization.
[00:42:02.975 --> 00:42:05.356]  Alright, let's go to Tom in Utah.
[00:42:05.356 --> 00:42:07.017]  Tom, what's on your mind?
[00:42:07.017 --> 00:42:07.817]  Howdy.
[00:42:07.817 --> 00:42:14.740]  The first thing I want to do is plead with anybody out there that has contact with Eustace Mullins.
[00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:16.061]  Is that a familiar name to you?
[00:42:16.061 --> 00:42:19.322]  I met Eustace, yes.
[00:42:19.322 --> 00:42:27.226]  I opened up an issue, and it may sound so trivial or unconnected, but it falls in with what you're talking about.
[00:42:28.249 --> 00:42:41.018]  It's about, you know, affecting the military, also affecting... I hate to even say this, it sounds like almost a eugenics program.
[00:42:41.018 --> 00:42:51.745]  Anyway, anybody can contact you, sister, if you can get him to contact me, and go to a website called gassingamerica.com.
[00:42:51.745 --> 00:42:56.828]  Again, that's gassingamerica.com, and I said that's kind of a curious
[00:42:57.561 --> 00:42:58.862]  issue with the military.
[00:42:58.862 --> 00:43:11.532]  The military is using units that were designed or put the change of design occurred after what I what I perceive as a curious meeting at Iron Mountain.
[00:43:12.939 --> 00:43:15.461]  I don't know.
[00:43:15.461 --> 00:43:16.222]  You know what, Tom?
[00:43:16.222 --> 00:43:17.403]  You're all over the place here.
[00:43:17.403 --> 00:43:19.244]  I mean, thanks for the call.
[00:43:19.244 --> 00:43:22.787]  Iron Mountain is a military base underground in Pennsylvania.
[00:43:22.787 --> 00:43:23.748]  God knows what they do there.
[00:43:23.748 --> 00:43:26.090]  We know they store a lot of things there.
[00:43:26.090 --> 00:43:32.335]  If you're talking about, I don't know, the depleted uranium in Iraq, you know, poisoning the soldiers, we know that's there.
[00:43:32.335 --> 00:43:37.719]  If you're talking about the chemtrails situation, I'm going to talk about chemtrails when we do the TV.
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:42.381]  Because I want to show the new Metallica video, All Nightmare Long.
[00:43:42.381 --> 00:43:49.723]  It's got the Tunguska event in it, it's got eugenics in it, it turns into something out of Doom, but then it goes into chemtrails.
[00:43:49.723 --> 00:43:56.185]  And I really think it's worth people watching because at the end they try to spin it that chemtrails are there to protect us.
[00:43:56.185 --> 00:43:59.566]  And I'm not a big fan of that, even though I'm a big fan of Metallica.
[00:43:59.566 --> 00:44:01.607]  Alright, let's go to the next caller.
[00:44:01.607 --> 00:44:03.568]  Let's go to Randy in Michigan.
[00:44:03.568 --> 00:44:04.328]  Randy, what's on your mind?
[00:44:05.598 --> 00:44:06.158]  Hey, Jason.
[00:44:06.158 --> 00:44:11.141]  Yeah, I call in often when you're hosting as well as Alex Jones.
[00:44:11.141 --> 00:44:14.582]  I was just going to comment on the draft thing.
[00:44:14.582 --> 00:44:15.443]  It's so true.
[00:44:15.443 --> 00:44:18.104]  You guys have been warning about it so long.
[00:44:18.104 --> 00:44:19.445]  Ron Paul's warned about it.
[00:44:19.445 --> 00:44:22.706]  I read his book, The Revolution, and I'll quote something out of his book.
[00:44:22.706 --> 00:44:23.727]  Is that okay if I do that?
[00:44:23.727 --> 00:44:24.287]  Yeah, sure.
[00:44:24.287 --> 00:44:24.967]  Please do.
[00:44:24.967 --> 00:44:25.507]  Okay.
[00:44:25.507 --> 00:44:26.328]  It's out of The Revolution.
[00:44:26.328 --> 00:44:32.911]  He says the draft is a totalitarian institution that is based on the idea that the government owns you and can dispose of your life as it wishes.
[00:44:32.911 --> 00:44:35.212]  Then he goes on about Robert Taft, how he talked about it.
[00:44:35.914 --> 00:44:40.615]  And Jason, how you were commenting on the obesity statement from those military guys or whatever.
[00:44:40.615 --> 00:44:43.816]  It just reminds me of how you and Alex warned of this in the past.
[00:44:43.816 --> 00:44:47.477]  How like how the government offers a problem, or creates a problem, then offers a solution.
[00:44:47.477 --> 00:44:48.898]  It's like narrow-minded solution.
[00:44:48.898 --> 00:44:50.758]  It's forcible, you know.
[00:44:50.758 --> 00:44:55.019]  And the corporations, they've been putting high fructose corn syrup in our foods here.
[00:44:55.019 --> 00:44:57.760]  And just to say, you know, half cents on a bottle of Coke or whatever.
[00:44:58.402 --> 00:45:02.104]  It's just making us fat, and then, oh hey, you guys are fat, get in the military.
[00:45:02.104 --> 00:45:02.845]  I don't know.
[00:45:02.845 --> 00:45:10.429]  Well, no, what it'll do is, that'll be part of your little carbon credit system, and I thank you for the call, Randy, and we always like Ron Paul quotes here, by the way.
[00:45:10.429 --> 00:45:22.916]  It'll go like this, oh, you're obese, you're going to have to pay a little more tax action, otherwise we're going to have to take your food from you, and basically Codex Alimentarius is going to decide what kind of foods you can have, what you can ingest.
[00:45:23.536 --> 00:45:24.818]  And we're going to talk about that later.
[00:45:24.818 --> 00:45:31.606]  Actually, a couple of our guests today are talking about how they're SWAT teaming and raiding Mennonites who are trying to sell eggs at local farmers markets.
[00:45:31.606 --> 00:45:37.733]  We're going to have Jonas Stolfitz and Maurice Thompson on from 2 to 3 in the final hour.
[00:45:37.733 --> 00:45:38.734]  And here's the deal.
[00:45:39.946 --> 00:45:44.709]  When people try to regulate your food, what's going to happen is the general populace is going to get very sick.
[00:45:44.709 --> 00:45:47.010]  A lot of us aren't going to have the vitamins and minerals we need.
[00:45:47.010 --> 00:45:48.511]  We're going to be turned into a slave class.
[00:45:48.511 --> 00:45:54.594]  And then, with this conscription, we're going to be the healthiest we've ever been from 18 to 25 while we're in the military.
[00:45:54.594 --> 00:45:59.337]  Because they're going to juice us up with all sorts of God knows what.
[00:45:59.337 --> 00:46:06.681]  And for a certain amount of time, we'll appear very healthy, but they'll probably have long-term detrimental effects like most of their vaccinations and programs do.
[00:46:07.782 --> 00:46:09.663]  All right, let's go to the next caller.
[00:46:09.663 --> 00:46:11.425]  Let's go to Scott in Seattle.
[00:46:11.425 --> 00:46:13.546]  Scott, what's on your mind?
[00:46:13.546 --> 00:46:14.347]  Yes, hello.
[00:46:14.347 --> 00:46:16.028]  Thank you for taking my call.
[00:46:16.028 --> 00:46:22.954]  First time caller, and I'm kind of glad that you brought up the draft because there's two things about it that I want to mention.
[00:46:22.954 --> 00:46:34.863]  I had kind of brought this up on my little internet show several months ago when people were denying that he was trying to push it, but isn't it just very funny how these so-called two-faced, phony-ass, progressive
[00:46:35.376 --> 00:46:37.517]  Well, Obama's acceptance speech
[00:47:01.747 --> 00:47:08.773]  When he won the election, he said that he was going to ask anybody for great service and sacrifice, every single one of you guys.
[00:47:08.773 --> 00:47:09.994]  So get ready!
[00:47:09.994 --> 00:47:18.060]  And they think it's some kind of John Kennedy type thing, talking about, you know, ask not what you can do for your country, blah, blah, blah.
[00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:29.650]  But the second thing that I wanted to bring up about it real quick, and I know you guys are in the information business, and I know it was posted on your blog about the National Service Act, but I don't think anybody is aware of this.
[00:47:30.543 --> 00:47:37.588]  You know, Carolyn Kennedy, who they're trying to get to replace on Hillary's Senate seat?
[00:47:37.588 --> 00:47:43.533]  I don't think anybody is aware of this, but she sits on the committee for the National Service Act.
[00:47:43.533 --> 00:47:43.693]  Wow.
[00:47:44.434 --> 00:47:45.715]  Well, I mean, it's not a shocker.
[00:47:45.715 --> 00:47:49.258]  A lot of these people aren't their, you know, their fathers, their uncles.
[00:47:49.258 --> 00:47:51.459]  And they do go along with the elitist system.
[00:47:51.459 --> 00:47:54.842]  Once you join politics, it's so hard to go against that route.
[00:47:54.842 --> 00:47:59.245]  And often those who do are in plane crashes, like her brother.
[00:47:59.245 --> 00:48:01.087]  And I'm sorry, not her brother, but her cousin.
[00:48:01.767 --> 00:48:05.348]  And not only him, but look at Paul Wellstone also in a plane crash.
[00:48:05.348 --> 00:48:12.169]  Hey, I don't know if these, you know, are any kind of conspiracies, but it is kind of funny how they just end up dying whenever they oppose the establishment.
[00:48:12.169 --> 00:48:13.150]  I thank you for the call, Scott.
[00:48:13.150 --> 00:48:15.130]  We're going to go to another first-time caller.
[00:48:15.130 --> 00:48:17.451]  Let's go to Bob in Vegas.
[00:48:17.451 --> 00:48:18.271]  Bob, what's on your mind?
[00:48:18.271 --> 00:48:19.771]  Hi, Jason.
[00:48:19.771 --> 00:48:20.571]  How you doing?
[00:48:20.571 --> 00:48:21.512]  Good, man.
[00:48:21.512 --> 00:48:22.892]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:48:22.892 --> 00:48:23.432]  You got it.
[00:48:23.432 --> 00:48:25.893]  I've always wanted to ask this question about GMOs.
[00:48:25.893 --> 00:48:26.933]  Whenever Osama
[00:48:27.666 --> 00:48:29.227]  Uh, left from Chicago.
[00:48:29.227 --> 00:48:34.549]  He got a hamburger and fries before he left, and when he got to Washington, he went out for a hot dog.
[00:48:34.549 --> 00:48:36.430]  What do these elites eat?
[00:48:36.430 --> 00:48:42.413]  Do they know that they're eating GMOs just like us, or do they ever go out to restaurants and eat because they're eating GMOs there too, aren't they?
[00:48:42.413 --> 00:48:48.595]  You know, a lot of them do, you know, pump down Diet Coke, and I mean, you can see it on the Bilderberg tapes.
[00:48:48.595 --> 00:48:56.779]  A lot of them don't eat healthy, but the probable difference is when you're a Rockefeller, I'm guessing that they give you some kind of vaccination that's not tainted.
[00:48:57.239 --> 00:48:58.640]  Or they give you the vitamin sources.
[00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:01.804]  I mean, there's plenty of people out there with natural cures for cancer.
[00:49:01.804 --> 00:49:02.845]  I'm not saying they all work.
[00:49:02.845 --> 00:49:04.146]  A lot of them are scams.
[00:49:04.146 --> 00:49:06.849]  But, you know, a lot of these things are health issues.
[00:49:06.849 --> 00:49:11.874]  So, you know, they probably have the top nutritionists in the world, you know, keeping their bodies healthy.
[00:49:11.874 --> 00:49:14.236]  I mean, they do seem to live an awful long time.
[00:49:14.236 --> 00:49:18.460]  I mean, Daddy Bush was just on TV with his son the other day, and he's well into his 80s.
[00:49:19.481 --> 00:49:19.922]  I don't
[00:49:49.441 --> 00:49:51.101]  We're good to go.
[00:50:18.302 --> 00:50:22.364]  Well, Jason, where do they get their groceries from, do you think?
[00:50:22.364 --> 00:50:27.206]  I would imagine from small farms that they're trying to outlaw.
[00:50:27.206 --> 00:50:28.607]  Okay, well thanks for taking my call.
[00:50:28.607 --> 00:50:30.347]  You got it.
[00:50:30.347 --> 00:50:34.689]  You know, most of them do eat the primo food, but a lot of them eat the garbage.
[00:50:34.689 --> 00:50:36.150]  Everybody loves Wendy's, right?
[00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:38.531]  They want to stuff their faces just like everybody else.
[00:50:38.531 --> 00:50:42.773]  The difference is they know how to treat themselves because they have the top doctors and nutritionists in the world.
[00:50:42.773 --> 00:50:43.953]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:50:43.953 --> 00:50:46.595]  I'm Jason Bermas, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:51:00.839 --> 00:51:04.323]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[00:51:04.323 --> 00:51:08.107]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:51:08.107 --> 00:51:14.414]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science, one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.
[00:51:14.414 --> 00:51:18.519]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[00:51:19.039 --> 00:51:25.063]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[00:51:25.063 --> 00:51:28.465]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:51:28.465 --> 00:51:33.128]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[00:51:33.128 --> 00:51:39.371]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[00:51:39.371 --> 00:51:44.334]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready with a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[00:51:44.334 --> 00:51:48.237]  Go to mysolarbackup.com and get off the grid today.
[00:51:51.457 --> 00:51:56.540]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:51:56.540 --> 00:51:57.981]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:52:10.359 --> 00:52:11.900]  But who is the enemy?
[00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:12.720]  Bin Laden.
[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:13.700]  This is his MO.
[00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:15.081]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:52:15.081 --> 00:52:17.082]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:52:17.082 --> 00:52:24.225]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:52:24.225 --> 00:52:24.705]  Some U.S.
[00:52:24.705 --> 00:52:30.348]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:52:31.048 --> 00:52:34.929]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:52:34.929 --> 00:52:45.012]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:52:45.012 --> 00:52:46.252]  Fabled Enemies.
[00:52:46.252 --> 00:52:54.014]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:52:54.014 --> 00:52:57.355]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[00:53:00.814 --> 00:53:03.316]  What will you do when the economy collapses?
[00:53:03.316 --> 00:53:06.298]  Store shelves are empty and your stored food is gone.
[00:53:06.298 --> 00:53:08.119]  How will you feed your family?
[00:53:08.119 --> 00:53:15.464]  True self-sufficiency and peace of mind is being able to grow a wide range of crops, ensuring a well-balanced diet for your family.
[00:53:15.464 --> 00:53:22.909]  GetSeeds.net is offering 100 different varieties of GM-free vegetable seeds for only $49 with free shipping.
[00:53:22.909 --> 00:53:26.491]  You get over 14,000 seeds for only $49.
[00:53:26.491 --> 00:53:30.514]  We offer a complete range of seeds, including heirloom tomatoes, old-fashioned beans,
[00:53:30.674 --> 00:53:31.054]  I think so.
[00:54:18.088 --> 00:54:20.869]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:20.869 --> 00:54:23.330]  And I'm hoping that these calls are going to remain somewhat on topic.
[00:54:23.330 --> 00:54:29.352]  I'm glad a couple people called in about the draft because, you know, we have talked about conscription on this program now for years.
[00:54:29.352 --> 00:54:37.636]  You know, a lot of people thought it would be under the Bush administration, but, you know, quite frankly, so many of their lives were so thinly veiled and exposed on some level.
[00:54:38.556 --> 00:54:43.337]  That it was hard for the people to get behind him in anything less than the September 11th event.
[00:54:43.337 --> 00:54:45.698]  And that's just the facts.
[00:54:45.698 --> 00:54:54.481]  And now they've manufactured this new state senator from 2004 to regular senator by 2006 to president in 2008.
[00:54:54.481 --> 00:54:57.121]  I mean, you know.
[00:54:57.121 --> 00:55:02.763]  I mean, a state senator running for senator in 2004, getting the Senate seat, and now he's our president?
[00:55:03.854 --> 00:55:06.277]  And they promote him as some kind of civil rights hero.
[00:55:06.277 --> 00:55:09.141]  He hasn't done anything for civil rights.
[00:55:09.141 --> 00:55:13.646]  You know, other than putting a puppet Manchurian candidate black guy in there.
[00:55:13.646 --> 00:55:18.372]  I would have much rather had Cynthia McKinney, an African American woman who stood for something.
[00:55:18.372 --> 00:55:20.555]  Actual civil rights.
[00:55:20.555 --> 00:55:21.276]  Pretty crazy, huh?
[00:55:22.262 --> 00:55:32.798]  And now with him naming his climate czar, Carol M. Browner, of the Sustainable World Society.
[00:55:32.798 --> 00:55:34.320]  Sustainable World Society.
[00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:37.364]  So again, it's all about regulation of what you can eat, breathe,
[00:55:39.232 --> 00:55:40.412]  Drive.
[00:55:40.412 --> 00:55:41.773]  How much garbage you can have.
[00:55:41.773 --> 00:55:43.193]  Oh, carbon footprint.
[00:55:43.193 --> 00:55:44.314]  How I wish you didn't exist.
[00:55:44.314 --> 00:55:45.454]  Well, you really don't exist.
[00:55:45.454 --> 00:55:47.735]  It's a nonsense term to enslave you.
[00:55:47.735 --> 00:55:49.475]  All right, let's keep taking calls.
[00:55:49.475 --> 00:55:54.897]  In the next hour, we're going to have Ted Anderson on and Marty Schachter.
[00:55:54.897 --> 00:55:58.699]  Top of the first hour, 1 o'clock, we're going to have Larry Pratt of Gun Owners of America.
[00:55:58.699 --> 00:56:05.181]  And then, of course, from 2 to 3, we're going to have Jonas Stolzfitz and Maurice Thompson.
[00:56:05.181 --> 00:56:08.042]  All right, let's go to Dave in California.
[00:56:08.042 --> 00:56:08.782]  Dave, what's on your mind?
[00:56:10.097 --> 00:56:10.597]  Hey, Jason.
[00:56:10.597 --> 00:56:11.898]  How are you?
[00:56:11.898 --> 00:56:15.939]  I got a comment on the draft, man, but can I finish up my thought from yesterday?
[00:56:15.939 --> 00:56:22.181]  I got cut off because I was busy talking about Obama and his being a messiah.
[00:56:22.181 --> 00:56:36.866]  I was talking about how the rulers put great stock in their symbols of fake power and fake honor and all that, and how ridiculous it is, and how we can hurt them with it without violence, and legally as well, because it feels good.
[00:56:36.866 --> 00:56:37.926]  Here's an example for you.
[00:56:38.632 --> 00:56:55.118]  Congratulations to our honorable United States Navy on the commissioning of their new aircraft carrier, the USS George Pervert Walker Bush, named after a child molesting homosexual criminal.
[00:56:55.118 --> 00:56:58.919]  Boy, I want my kid to serve on that ship!
[00:56:58.919 --> 00:57:03.381]  I'm referring to the Washington Times front page story during the Reagan-Bush administration
[00:57:08.209 --> 00:57:18.077]  I'm glad you brought that up because we talked about that earlier today.
[00:57:18.077 --> 00:57:26.304]  That's kind of a nexus point into the Barney Frank stuff that I was talking about earlier where he was caught running an underage male brothel out of his D.C.
[00:57:26.304 --> 00:57:27.224]  home as well.
[00:57:27.224 --> 00:57:28.405]  And I would encourage people to watch.
[00:57:29.286 --> 00:57:31.708]  You know, Franklin Cover-Up's got a lot more information.
[00:57:31.708 --> 00:57:33.669]  I've read the Franklin Cover-Up as well.
[00:57:33.669 --> 00:57:42.155]  But, uh, Conspiracy of Silence is one of those YouTube videos out there that really, it'll absolutely make you vomit in your mouth if you sit through the whole hour.
[00:57:42.155 --> 00:57:46.778]  And this was something that was supposed to air on, it was either the Discovery Channel or A&E.
[00:57:46.778 --> 00:57:48.339]  I think it was the Discovery Channel.
[00:57:48.339 --> 00:57:52.621]  It was actually listed in, uh, Local and the National TV Guides.
[00:57:53.682 --> 00:57:56.465]  And it was lobbied not to be put on television.
[00:57:56.465 --> 00:57:57.526]  They paid all the expense.
[00:57:57.526 --> 00:58:00.889]  I think it was something over $250,000 back to the producers.
[00:58:00.889 --> 00:58:02.651]  Congress paid for it.
[00:58:02.651 --> 00:58:10.218]  And even more disturbing is the fact that the only reason it's out there is because somebody who worked on the case had a work print copy.
[00:58:10.218 --> 00:58:12.300]  Or someone in the editing room had a work print copy.
[00:58:13.687 --> 00:58:18.515]  And he gave it to John DeCamp so he could present it in one of the boys' cases.
[00:58:18.515 --> 00:58:20.217]  Dave, we'll come back to you on the other side.
[00:58:20.217 --> 00:58:24.103]  Five after the hour, we have Midas Resources and Ted Anderson on.
[00:58:24.103 --> 00:58:25.265]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:58:25.265 --> 00:58:27.388]  Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:58:41.631 --> 00:58:46.494]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:46.494 --> 00:58:50.757]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.757 --> 00:58:51.398]  Hello, friends.
[00:58:51.398 --> 00:58:52.458]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:58:52.458 --> 00:58:57.202]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:58:57.202 --> 00:59:00.164]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:59:00.164 --> 00:59:03.206]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:59:03.206 --> 00:59:07.929]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[00:59:08.149 --> 00:59:09.271]  If you simply prepare.
[00:59:09.271 --> 00:59:12.514]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:59:12.514 --> 00:59:19.523]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration or Chinese imports.
[00:59:19.523 --> 00:59:22.807]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:59:22.807 --> 00:59:23.047]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:59:25.470 --> 00:59:27.932]  Or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:59:27.932 --> 00:59:34.196]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, prescribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[00:59:34.196 --> 00:59:37.978]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[00:59:37.978 --> 00:59:39.239]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:59:39.239 --> 00:59:39.939]  Take action today.
[00:59:39.939 --> 00:59:41.760]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:59:53.556 --> 00:59:55.938]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.938 --> 01:00:05.224]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.224 --> 01:00:06.525]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.525 --> 01:00:08.306]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.306 --> 01:00:10.068]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.068 --> 01:00:11.629]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.629 --> 01:00:13.210]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.210 --> 01:00:17.393]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.393 --> 01:00:21.455]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.149 --> 01:00:25.070]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[01:00:25.070 --> 01:00:32.994]  I am not Alex Jones, I am Jason Burmess, filmmaker of Loose Change, Final Cut, and Fabled Enemies, both available over at InfoWars.com.
[01:00:32.994 --> 01:00:41.959]  It is January 13th, 2009, one week away from the inauguration of our new dictator, Barack Obama.
[01:00:41.959 --> 01:00:44.080]  He's not really a dictator, he's a puppet dictator, I should...
[01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:45.421]  Get it right.
[01:00:45.421 --> 01:00:55.749]  Right now we're on the line with Dave, who's making a point of a non-violent way for us to have an effect, and it's really to go after their symbols, their ships named after them, their monuments.
[01:00:55.749 --> 01:01:00.233]  I know the Georgia Guidestones had something happen to them a couple weeks ago.
[01:01:00.233 --> 01:01:01.354]  Go ahead, Dave.
[01:01:01.354 --> 01:01:07.459]  Okay, well, basically, yeah, it's a way to attack them directly, and I think really we've been polite too long now.
[01:01:07.459 --> 01:01:14.124]  I mean, we keep asking them questions and stuff, and hey, I don't take anything away from the brave people that get up in these people's face and ask them questions.
[01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:21.320]  But it's hard to get out a complete sentence or a good question and you know you're not going to get an answer because they have no answer.
[01:01:22.063 --> 01:01:25.265]  It's nice to get him to stammer on video or sometimes make an admission.
[01:01:25.265 --> 01:01:32.007]  I find you get more flies with honey, so you kind of make it like you're taking their position the way you prefaced the question.
[01:01:32.007 --> 01:01:34.989]  They'll open up a little more then, and then you can go after the hardcore stuff.
[01:01:34.989 --> 01:01:43.072]  Since I haven't done it, I can't say, but if I get a chance at somebody like Dick Cheney, I'm just going to start hollering, you're a 9-11 criminal.
[01:01:43.072 --> 01:01:44.873]  Arrest that man right now!
[01:01:44.873 --> 01:01:46.654]  What do you have to say about these draft clips, Dave?
[01:01:47.153 --> 01:01:58.878]  Okay, well, regarding the draft, I just wanted to point out that wasn't it Charlie Dingell that first brought up the conscription back during the beginning of the Bush era, saying that that would make it more fair if everybody had to join?
[01:01:59.568 --> 01:02:02.190]  Oh, you know, this has been around now since they've taken away.
[01:02:02.190 --> 01:02:09.996]  So, I mean, I'm trying to think who it was, even during, you know, the Bush administration, in the military, saying it was unnecessary.
[01:02:09.996 --> 01:02:11.757]  I think that Buchanan mentions his name.
[01:02:11.757 --> 01:02:12.578]  It's an ongoing thing.
[01:02:12.578 --> 01:02:14.479]  They've wanted this for a long time.
[01:02:14.479 --> 01:02:19.103]  You know, every proponent of Israel is always like, we should have it just like the Israelis do.
[01:02:19.103 --> 01:02:21.645]  Mandatory conscription for everybody.
[01:02:21.645 --> 01:02:21.965]  Obviously.
[01:02:21.965 --> 01:02:22.886]  You did a great job.
[01:02:23.106 --> 01:02:25.548]  Yeah, oh yeah, they do such a great job with their black ops.
[01:02:25.548 --> 01:02:27.229]  Dave, I thank you for the call.
[01:02:27.229 --> 01:02:29.310]  Let's take one more caller.
[01:02:29.310 --> 01:02:31.011]  Let's go to Richard in Ohio.
[01:02:31.011 --> 01:02:34.433]  Richard, what's on your mind?
[01:02:34.433 --> 01:02:38.936]  Okay, let's go to Eric in Maryland.
[01:02:38.936 --> 01:02:39.576]  Hello?
[01:02:39.576 --> 01:02:40.457]  Yes, what's on your mind, Eric?
[01:02:40.457 --> 01:02:44.759]  Alright, yeah, well I have a couple of things, just a couple of small things.
[01:02:44.759 --> 01:02:50.563]  One of the things is I live in Hagerstown, Maryland, which is very close to Antenna Battlefield.
[01:02:50.563 --> 01:02:52.684]  The reason I ask that, or the reason I say that is because
[01:02:53.346 --> 01:03:07.173]  I've been watching this show for a while, I'm a first-time caller, and I was up there looking around at Burnside Bridge, you know, the famous bridge in the war, you know, the Antietam Battlefield, the famous battle in the Antietam.
[01:03:07.173 --> 01:03:18.239]  And on the subscription, I looked up the title, I didn't even catch it, and I was reading through the history, and I thought, well, you know, this is just basic history, you know, blah, blah, blah, I've heard it before, right, when I was a kid.
[01:03:18.239 --> 01:03:19.820]  But when I looked at the title of who was here,
[01:03:21.883 --> 01:03:27.668]  I thought you'd see, you know, the Confederals, the Confederates, you know, the South and all this.
[01:03:27.668 --> 01:03:29.630]  And I see this thing called the Federalists.
[01:03:29.630 --> 01:03:31.992]  And I thought, I can't believe what I just saw.
[01:03:31.992 --> 01:03:33.333]  You know, I thought, the Federalists.
[01:03:33.333 --> 01:03:36.716]  And it hit me until like, just a couple weeks ago, the Federalists.
[01:03:36.716 --> 01:03:42.661]  And I thought, FBI, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, I thought the Federal Reserve, you know.
[01:03:42.661 --> 01:03:44.162]  I thought, wow, that's incredible.
[01:03:44.162 --> 01:03:45.543]  And also something else I want to ask.
[01:03:46.837 --> 01:03:52.042]  Well actually I wanted to tell you about this because I've seen it on TV so many times it just makes me mad.
[01:03:52.042 --> 01:03:59.109]  I just want to throw something at the TV.
[01:03:59.109 --> 01:04:00.730]  It's the medicine thing.
[01:04:00.730 --> 01:04:03.193]  We've got all these different medicines they're advertising on TV.
[01:04:03.573 --> 01:04:06.554]  I mean, are they advertising it to us directly?
[01:04:06.554 --> 01:04:08.754]  Because we can't get it without a prescription.
[01:04:08.754 --> 01:04:11.435]  Oh yeah, but they'll give you a prescription for all that stuff.
[01:04:11.435 --> 01:04:12.195]  Are you tired?
[01:04:12.195 --> 01:04:13.015]  Are you depressed?
[01:04:13.015 --> 01:04:13.715]  Yeah!
[01:04:13.715 --> 01:04:15.636]  I mean, do you sleep?
[01:04:15.636 --> 01:04:16.736]  Do you have naps?
[01:04:16.736 --> 01:04:18.156]  Do you have headaches?
[01:04:18.156 --> 01:04:20.417]  Do you not feel great all the time?
[01:04:20.417 --> 01:04:23.017]  I mean, it's absolutely ridiculous and you know what they're doing?
[01:04:23.017 --> 01:04:25.478]  They're just trying to get you to get hooked on a medical drug.
[01:04:25.478 --> 01:04:26.698]  The people that they can't get hooked...
[01:04:27.458 --> 01:04:40.102]  On the illegal drugs that they ship in and then incarcerate them, at least they can zombify them with Paxil and Prozac and all these other, you know, reuptake inhibitors that are just absolutely ludicrous.
[01:04:40.102 --> 01:04:42.802]  If you're giving your kid Ritalin, take a look in the mirror.
[01:04:42.802 --> 01:04:43.622]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:04:43.622 --> 01:04:45.183]  We'll be back with Ted Anderson after this.
[01:05:00.990 --> 01:05:05.912]  Phase 1 of the Insiders' plan for a One World Government has been initiated with the recent bailout.
[01:05:05.912 --> 01:05:13.355]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new World Bank to act as savior.
[01:05:13.355 --> 01:05:14.956]  But we've only seen the beginning.
[01:05:14.956 --> 01:05:19.118]  Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times.
[01:05:19.118 --> 01:05:22.959]  Shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land.
[01:05:22.959 --> 01:05:27.421]  The Insiders have discovered that they must control two things to seize total power.
[01:05:27.421 --> 01:05:29.382]  Phase 1 is a One World Currency.
[01:05:29.542 --> 01:05:31.763]  Which we are currently being prepared to accept.
[01:05:31.763 --> 01:05:35.865]  Phase 2 of their insidious plan is complete control of our food supplies.
[01:05:35.865 --> 01:05:40.547]  Go to www.foodshortageusa.com for the details.
[01:05:40.547 --> 01:05:46.310]  That's www.foodshortageusa.com to learn how to prepare for the unthinkable.

[01:05:50.912 --> 01:05:53.733]  Go to foodshortageusa.com or call 877-327-0365.
[01:05:53.733 --> 01:05:54.013]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:05:59.516 --> 01:06:07.844]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:06:07.844 --> 01:06:09.466]  The enemy struck America on September 11.
[01:06:10.481 --> 01:06:12.022]  But who is the enemy?
[01:06:12.022 --> 01:06:12.822]  Bin Laden.
[01:06:12.822 --> 01:06:13.782]  This is his ammo.
[01:06:13.782 --> 01:06:15.203]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:06:15.203 --> 01:06:17.163]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:06:17.163 --> 01:06:24.326]  Enabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:06:24.326 --> 01:06:24.806]  Some U.S.
[01:06:24.806 --> 01:06:30.468]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:06:31.168 --> 01:06:34.670]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:06:34.670 --> 01:06:37.471]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:07:01.101 --> 01:07:05.625]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[01:07:05.625 --> 01:07:10.730]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:07:10.730 --> 01:07:12.231]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:07:12.231 --> 01:07:15.855]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[01:08:07.043 --> 01:08:08.805]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:08.805 --> 01:08:10.566]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:10.566 --> 01:08:12.148]  You want answers?
[01:08:12.148 --> 01:08:13.709]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.709 --> 01:08:17.893]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.893 --> 01:08:20.215]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[01:08:21.104 --> 01:08:23.007]  Alex Jones.
[01:08:23.007 --> 01:08:25.050]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we are back.
[01:08:25.050 --> 01:08:26.232]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:26.232 --> 01:08:29.577]  I am Jason Vermas, sitting in for the week.
[01:08:29.577 --> 01:08:32.542]  We have on the line Ted Anderson of Midas Resources.
[01:08:32.542 --> 01:08:35.506]  He really helps make this program possible, the head of GCN.
[01:08:35.506 --> 01:08:37.189]  And gold is up today, isn't it, Ted?
[01:08:37.662 --> 01:08:38.222]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:08:38.222 --> 01:08:41.844]  It took a nice little rise after yesterday's drop, which is good to see.
[01:08:41.844 --> 01:08:58.650]  I mean, when you watch the gold prices falling yesterday, you just knew that the financial manipulators, the central banks of the world, were trying to convince people that they should stay in the paper and get away from gold.
[01:08:58.650 --> 01:09:00.670]  I mean, that's what they've been doing here.
[01:09:00.670 --> 01:09:03.391]  I mean, even going back when gold was pegged at $400 an ounce, every time
[01:09:05.819 --> 01:09:08.680]  Gold would start to increase over 400.
[01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:22.527]  They would lower the lease rates and sort of push the mining companies into the position where they'd sell short their position in the ground to push more gold into the marketplace before it's even produced and dropping the prices.
[01:09:22.527 --> 01:09:26.008]  I mean, that's part of the way that they manipulate things in the futures market.
[01:09:26.008 --> 01:09:33.512]  And the reason why they do those things is because they want to hide and mask all the problems financially that are going on in the world and keep people from
[01:09:34.090 --> 01:09:39.287]  They're fleeing to hard assets and staying in their paper currencies for which they get to produce for nothing.
[01:09:39.761 --> 01:09:42.883]  Yeah, you know, I was an avid listener, you know, not so long ago.
[01:09:42.883 --> 01:09:47.046]  I think, you know, six years ago in 2003 when it was under $400 an ounce.
[01:09:47.046 --> 01:09:54.892]  And for something to more than double in value in that short a period of time, and really it does protect you from the fiat currency.
[01:09:54.892 --> 01:09:59.956]  The fact that we've got Bernanke today saying that, of course, we need more bailouts for more banks.
[01:09:59.956 --> 01:10:03.539]  And Obama's supposed to address the nation with his economic plan.
[01:10:03.539 --> 01:10:05.760]  And he'll probably say, yeah, we're going to give bailouts to everybody.
[01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:06.301]  It's going to be great.
[01:10:06.718 --> 01:10:10.160]  Well, you know, Obama, I mean, that's the fight right now.
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:23.306]  Obama's saying, hey, let's give the money to the people directly, and the Bernanke's, along with, along with, oh, what's his name, I can't even remember, but Bernanke's... Paulson?
[01:10:23.306 --> 01:10:34.351]  Yeah, well, not Paulson, it's the chairman, the Democratic senator, anyway, I can't remember, but anyways, they're talking about giving the money to banks, you know, thank God, at least,
[01:10:34.995 --> 01:10:41.617]  At least, Obama is talking about having more accountability.
[01:10:41.617 --> 01:10:47.819]  I mean, we gave away $350 billion, and we don't even know where the money went to.
[01:10:47.819 --> 01:11:03.785]  I mean, you can kind of follow the tracks and guess, because the banks that we gave it to were busy buying up all the banks that they competed with, so they could build even bigger monopolies and have even more risk of failing if they're these big institutions, so they can get even more money when they come in.
[01:11:04.867 --> 01:11:14.393]  It's such a crazy game and none of the money made it into the economy to stimulate whatever it was for, because there's more unemployment now than there was when it started.
[01:11:14.393 --> 01:11:15.674]  There's more companies failing.
[01:11:15.674 --> 01:11:16.815]  There's more bankruptcies.
[01:11:16.815 --> 01:11:19.196]  I mean, the economy has slid backwards.
[01:11:19.196 --> 01:11:20.738]  It hasn't helped a bit.
[01:11:20.738 --> 01:11:23.920]  And now they're talking about, you know, let's give more money to the banks.
[01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:26.802]  I mean, of course Bernanke is going to say that, because that's his buddies.
[01:11:26.802 --> 01:11:31.324]  I mean, the people that own the Federal Reserve System are the member banks.
[01:11:31.324 --> 01:11:33.326]  It's the Chase Manhattan, the Citicorp,
[01:11:33.939 --> 01:11:35.480]  The Wells Fargo Bank.
[01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:44.424]  I mean, if there's anything that just boils my blood more than anything, and it's the very fact that the United States people labor.
[01:11:44.424 --> 01:11:49.407]  I mean, we are the ones that create the money that we use for commerce.
[01:11:49.407 --> 01:11:51.488]  The money is made out of cotton.
[01:11:51.488 --> 01:11:53.049]  Everybody says it's made out of paper.
[01:11:53.049 --> 01:11:54.709]  Paper means wood pulp to me.
[01:11:56.277 --> 01:12:00.220]  But if you go to Washington, D.C., they're going to tell you exactly what it's made out of.
[01:12:00.220 --> 01:12:02.581]  Most of the fibers in there are made from cotton.
[01:12:02.581 --> 01:12:06.224]  And that money is manufactured and printed by the U.S.
[01:12:06.224 --> 01:12:09.546]  Treasury, which is financed by the taxpayers.
[01:12:09.546 --> 01:12:12.248]  And that money is then turned over to the Federal Reserve System.
[01:12:12.248 --> 01:12:15.990]  It has no value until they put their one little ink stamp on it.
[01:12:15.990 --> 01:12:19.372]  And then what do they do to get it in the economy so we can use it as commerce?
[01:12:19.372 --> 01:12:20.153]  They lend it to us.
[01:12:20.646 --> 01:12:26.690]  So they're getting it for free, and they lend it to us, and they lend it to us at the current interest rate, whatever it is.
[01:12:26.690 --> 01:12:32.134]  If the 30-year treasury is at 5%, they're getting 5% for doing nothing.
[01:12:32.134 --> 01:12:47.064]  And now we're bailing out all the banks that are in this game, that are getting this something for nothing, and we're giving them even more tax dollars just because they went in and they made some investments, some mal-investments,
[01:12:47.614 --> 01:12:50.735]  In second-rate mortgages, which are now being defaulted on.
[01:12:50.735 --> 01:12:52.835]  You know, the whole game is crazy.
[01:12:52.835 --> 01:13:05.078]  I can tell you right now, Jason, if there's anything that I can do for the United States of America, is to just win the mind so people can actually think logically of what's really going on here.
[01:13:05.078 --> 01:13:10.159]  Because everybody, you know, half of the public, or more than half of the public, they just don't know.
[01:13:10.159 --> 01:13:14.780]  They don't know what it means when there's an economic stimulus package or a bailout.
[01:13:14.780 --> 01:13:16.641]  We're just selling out.
[01:13:16.641 --> 01:13:17.221]  We labor.
[01:13:17.677 --> 01:13:21.800]  We work 45% of our year just to pay taxes.
[01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:30.087]  Most of those taxes for which go to the interest on the debt, which is funneled right back to this banking system that gets us money for nothing.
[01:13:30.087 --> 01:13:36.032]  So we're just laboring our lives away so they can live bigger and fatter.
[01:13:36.032 --> 01:13:38.674]  It's like there's this fulcrum in the middle.
[01:13:38.674 --> 01:13:40.015]  It's like a teeter-totter.
[01:13:40.015 --> 01:13:44.218]  We have the taxpayers on one end carrying the burden of this huge debt
[01:13:44.648 --> 01:13:52.311]  And as the debt continues to grow, it becomes tougher and tougher for the people that work in this country to service that debt.
[01:13:52.311 --> 01:14:09.199]  And at the same time, on the other side of that teeter-totter, as the debt continues to grow, and we get further on the hook, this money institution, this machine, becomes more profitable because they get to have more of our labor, or more of the fruits of our labor.
[01:14:09.199 --> 01:14:11.740]  And it's just, it's a crazy process.
[01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:13.481]  It certainly isn't constitutional.
[01:14:14.497 --> 01:14:36.428]  We're not intended by our forefathers to have it this way, and yet this is what we have, and the only way we can stop this from happening is to get the people involved and educate them and teach them that this is the process, and until you stop the process, this financial machine will work against us every corner we turn, and they're gonna buttercoat it to make it look like they're helping us.
[01:14:36.428 --> 01:14:37.129]  That's the whole sickness.
[01:14:40.014 --> 01:14:56.737]  When Bernanke's in there saying, hey, we need to bail out these banks, we need to give more power, we need to turn over our money without accountability, I mean, it is, you know, what it is is just selling the people further down the road, and the people are thinking, oh great, the government's going to bail us out.
[01:14:56.737 --> 01:15:01.278]  We'll have all these checks, the economy's going to do better because the government's helping us.
[01:15:01.278 --> 01:15:04.759]  The more the government helps us, the more they're hurting us.
[01:15:04.759 --> 01:15:08.560]  And for some reason the people don't understand that
[01:15:09.181 --> 01:15:15.724]  This is how the system works, and we're just going further down the drain is what we're doing.
[01:15:15.724 --> 01:15:17.405]  Well, it's by design they don't know what's going on.
[01:15:17.405 --> 01:15:25.328]  I mean, you can have Dennis Kucinich on the floor house actually say that Federal Reserve is as federal as Federal Express, and none of the mainstream media will cover that.
[01:15:25.328 --> 01:15:29.890]  But it is a talking point that now we are in the worst economic state since the Great Depression.
[01:15:29.890 --> 01:15:33.352]  Why don't you help people protect themselves and give out the website for Midas Resources?
[01:15:33.837 --> 01:15:59.260]  Well, I'll tell you the first thing that I'm doing, my next campaign is this, I mean we've done an awful lot with Genesis and I'm really pleased to have the people supporting us like they do, but my next thing is I'm going to be running Creature from Jekyll Island spots on Rush Limbaugh, you can listen for them, Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck, and then we're also going to be going into George Norrie and Dr. Laura Schlesinger, which is
[01:16:00.050 --> 01:16:07.876]  The biggest talk shows out there and just start educating those people so they can start calling in on those shows and it'll help turn things.
[01:16:07.876 --> 01:16:09.477]  That's a great way to protect it.
[01:16:09.477 --> 01:16:16.662]  If you want to understand the system and you don't yet, I would suggest that you pick up the Creature from Jekyll Island book from us.
[01:16:16.662 --> 01:16:21.004]  I think Ed Griffin puts it together pretty well and makes it interesting.
[01:16:21.004 --> 01:16:22.686]  The book itself sells.
[01:16:22.686 --> 01:16:23.326]  We're selling for $19.95.
[01:16:25.645 --> 01:16:27.387]  With the postage, it's $6.50.
[01:16:27.387 --> 01:16:31.071]  It's $26.45.
[01:16:31.071 --> 01:16:32.552]  We also put a U.S.
[01:16:32.552 --> 01:16:34.254]  silver dollar inside of the book.
[01:16:34.254 --> 01:16:39.238]  We put it into a little plastic flip and we put it inside of the book so you can actually see what money really is.
[01:16:39.238 --> 01:16:44.583]  And the neat part about it is that $19.95 is what you'd pay for the silver dollar.
[01:16:44.583 --> 01:16:47.386]  If you already know how the Fed works and you've read the book, fine.
[01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:56.424]  Buy it, take the silver dollar, keep it in your pocket, give the book to somebody that needs to understand the system, and then tell them how to get a copy of their own.
[01:16:56.424 --> 01:16:58.585]  I think that's the basis of this whole thing.
[01:16:58.585 --> 01:17:03.388]  The United States of America needs this education now worse than ever.
[01:17:03.388 --> 01:17:07.930]  In addition to this, the people of the United States of America are hungry for it.
[01:17:07.930 --> 01:17:14.493]  Five, six years ago when the stock market was going up and everything looked rosy, couldn't convince anybody to take this book.
[01:17:14.493 --> 01:17:16.054]  Now they're starting to buy it.
[01:17:16.054 --> 01:17:17.355]  And I can tell you right now, Jason,
[01:17:17.788 --> 01:17:23.410]  It's going to mean the difference between having liberty in the United States or not having liberty.
[01:17:23.410 --> 01:17:24.970]  It really comes down to that.
[01:17:24.970 --> 01:17:29.612]  The United States of America cannot have liberty when it's being run by a central bank.
[01:17:29.612 --> 01:17:30.792]  Can't have it.
[01:17:30.792 --> 01:17:36.714]  I agree, and you have Newsweek now saying we need a bank of the world, and this is going to be the next talking point.
[01:17:36.714 --> 01:17:41.655]  God knows how Obama is going to restructure the financial situation.
[01:17:41.655 --> 01:17:42.496]  I'm pretty worried about it.
[01:17:43.376 --> 01:17:47.359]  For a little peace of mind, hard currency, silver, gold, it's what to have.
[01:17:47.359 --> 01:18:07.692]  And, you know, I actually plugged the Creature from Jekyll Island in that silver dollar yesterday because I've sat down with G. Edward Griffin now like three different times and had dinner with him and his lectures from A World Without Cancer to The Creature from Jekyll Island to his New World Order lecture, this guy is well-spoken, he's well-written, and he really does, Ted, break down the financial system to what it really is.
[01:18:08.092 --> 01:18:08.973]  Well, that's the point.
[01:18:08.973 --> 01:18:13.336]  I mean, people need to be educated under terms that they can understand.
[01:18:13.336 --> 01:18:16.878]  I mean, everybody understands that, well, we have to keep a budget.
[01:18:16.878 --> 01:18:19.099]  I can't spend more than I have, so on and so forth.
[01:18:19.099 --> 01:18:21.141]  How come the government can spend beyond its budget?
[01:18:21.141 --> 01:18:28.165]  And the answer to that question is that we're not going to have currency for commerce unless if the United States of America goes further into debt.
[01:18:28.165 --> 01:18:29.747]  Think about that for a minute.
[01:18:29.747 --> 01:18:31.948]  And why would you want to have gold and silver?
[01:18:31.948 --> 01:18:33.009]  Oh my gosh.
[01:18:33.009 --> 01:18:35.470]  Why would you want to have paper currency over gold and silver?
[01:18:35.470 --> 01:18:36.251]  That's the question.
[01:18:36.724 --> 01:18:39.445]  Right now, at this particular time, you have a better buy.
[01:18:39.445 --> 01:18:46.006]  Gold just came down about $30 an ounce, and we're close to $700.
[01:18:46.006 --> 01:18:48.067]  It's about $830 right now.
[01:18:48.067 --> 01:18:52.428]  It obviously is the time to be buying into the precious metals market.
[01:18:52.428 --> 01:18:56.169]  Whether or not you get into the precious metals market is not that important.
[01:18:56.169 --> 01:19:00.090]  What's important is that you take the time to educate yourself so you understand the system.
[01:19:01.006 --> 01:19:03.227]  So you can bring this information to other people.
[01:19:03.227 --> 01:19:05.988]  Right now, we need to be out there, on our toes.
[01:19:05.988 --> 01:19:09.669]  I mean, just like your movie you made on 9-11.
[01:19:09.669 --> 01:19:18.293]  It's that very seed that needs to be planted in the minds, so they have a little bit of a doubt that maybe the government's not giving us the right deal right now.
[01:19:18.293 --> 01:19:22.574]  Maybe it's not what's... they're really not helping us, they're hurting us.
[01:19:22.574 --> 01:19:24.095]  And that's exactly what's occurring.
[01:19:24.383 --> 01:19:30.748]  The United States government right now is forced into a position to take on more debt in order for us to have more money in commerce.
[01:19:30.748 --> 01:19:33.389]  That's what they're trying to do.
[01:19:33.389 --> 01:19:38.493]  Ted, I agree with you a hundred percent, and that's why you need to go to Midas Resources right now and pick up some gold and silver.
[01:19:38.493 --> 01:19:45.198]  And if you do have a family member, a friend that doesn't understand what the Federal Reserve is, the Creature from Jekyll Island is the perfect purchase.
[01:19:45.198 --> 01:19:46.739]  It comes with one ounce of silver.
[01:19:46.739 --> 01:19:48.901]  Just like Ted said, it's basically free.
[01:19:48.901 --> 01:19:49.801]  Midas Resources.
[01:19:49.801 --> 01:19:51.002]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:19:51.002 --> 01:19:51.723]  Infowars.com.
[01:20:05.379 --> 01:20:08.422]  Are you one of the millions of people who make New Year's resolutions?
[01:20:08.422 --> 01:20:12.406]  Are you also one of the millions who wind up breaking those resolutions?
[01:20:12.406 --> 01:20:15.509]  Would you like to keep at least one of those resolutions this year?
[01:20:15.509 --> 01:20:18.631]  Well, right now, success is one click away.

[01:21:01.092 --> 01:21:01.592]  Good day.
[01:21:01.592 --> 01:21:03.233]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[01:21:03.233 --> 01:21:03.693]  January 13, 2009.
[01:21:03.693 --> 01:21:04.774]  Gold opened this morning at $821.70.
[01:21:04.774 --> 01:21:07.695]  One ounce gold coin can be purchased for $846.29, $423.15 for a half ounce, and $211.57 for the quarter ounce.
[01:21:07.695 --> 01:21:08.255]  That's $846.29, $423.15, and $211.57.
[01:21:18.607 --> 01:21:20.789]  The dollar has fallen to 65% of the euro.
[01:21:20.789 --> 01:21:21.850]  Erosion accelerates.
[01:21:21.850 --> 01:21:28.917]  Mainline talk show hosts are trying to hold on to their support of the conservative movement, keeping focus on the Republican agenda and playing into the hand of the globalists.
[01:21:28.917 --> 01:21:32.260]  Dr. Corsi interviewed Robert Pastor of the American University.
[01:21:32.260 --> 01:21:38.466]  With the sleight of hand and incremental implementation, Pastor admits to the North American Union is being forced upon us.
[01:21:38.886 --> 01:21:43.567]  Corsi uncovers the CFR's plan to build a North American community similar to the EU.
[01:21:43.567 --> 01:21:48.589]  In his report, the North American Union isn't going away, Corsi exposes the deception and trickery.

[01:21:49.929 --> 01:21:55.350]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.

[01:21:57.151 --> 01:21:58.251]  The forces of globalism are destroying
[01:22:04.813 --> 01:22:05.794]  We're good to go.

[01:23:01.343 --> 01:23:03.164]  The headlines are clear.
[01:23:03.164 --> 01:23:06.065]  The worldwide economic collapse is here.
[01:23:06.065 --> 01:23:09.287]  The military is being positioned for martial law.
[01:23:09.287 --> 01:23:11.027]  The mark of the beast is at hand.
[01:23:11.027 --> 01:23:14.329]  Governments are calling for a new world cashless economic system.
[01:23:14.329 --> 01:23:17.090]  Having a long-term food solution is your only hope.

[01:23:33.060 --> 01:23:36.643]  15,000 seeds that will feed a family healthy food for 7 years.
[01:23:36.643 --> 01:23:45.849]  Big John Lipscomb, host of Don't Tread on Me, is including an instructional DVD that will teach you how to earn big money selling the produce from his incredible heirloom seeds back to him.
[01:23:45.849 --> 01:23:47.350]  Restaurants and small delis.
[01:23:47.350 --> 01:23:48.571]  Don't buy from copycats.

[01:23:57.033 --> 01:23:59.014]  A long-term food solution.
[01:23:59.014 --> 01:24:09.736]  Alright folks, we're back.
[01:24:09.736 --> 01:24:11.257]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:11.257 --> 01:24:14.077]  I'm in with Ted Anderson of Midas Resources.
[01:24:14.077 --> 01:24:15.818]  Ted, why don't you give the 800 number out to people?
[01:24:16.437 --> 01:24:17.138]  Yeah, of course.
[01:24:17.138 --> 01:24:22.665]  If they want to get a hold of us, they can catch us at 800-686-2237.
[01:24:22.665 --> 01:24:25.128]  And the name that I was thinking of was Barney Frank.
[01:24:25.128 --> 01:24:25.769]  Oh, you know what?
[01:24:25.769 --> 01:24:28.833]  We talked about Barney Frank extensively today.
[01:24:28.833 --> 01:24:33.418]  You know, in the late 80s, he was caught with an underage male brothel running out of his D.C.
[01:24:33.418 --> 01:24:33.839]  home, right?
[01:24:34.420 --> 01:24:36.842]  No, I guess I didn't know that.
[01:24:36.842 --> 01:24:40.984]  I have the Time Magazine article right here, A Skeleton in Barney's Closet.
[01:24:40.984 --> 01:24:43.246]  I mean, this guy, and he's all over the news, too.
[01:24:43.246 --> 01:24:45.087]  You know, nothing ever happened to this guy.
[01:24:45.087 --> 01:24:49.389]  It makes me sick that these are the people that are supposedly in charge of our monetary system, Ted.
[01:24:49.389 --> 01:24:52.191]  Look, they're so bought and paid for, it's not even funny.
[01:24:52.191 --> 01:24:53.672]  And here's the way I see it.
[01:24:53.672 --> 01:25:02.778]  Either we stand up and do something, we can possibly end the federal income tax and get back to real currency, or we do nothing and we're going to end up paying a world tax
[01:25:03.257 --> 01:25:12.520]  To some world ruler, and the United States of America, as we see it, and the Constitution, is going to become worthless to us.
[01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:15.201]  Obama's already putting in more global government people.
[01:25:15.201 --> 01:25:21.163]  His climate change czar is part of the World Society that's calling for global governance.
[01:25:21.163 --> 01:25:21.703]  What's it called?
[01:25:21.703 --> 01:25:24.264]  It's the Sustainable World Society.
[01:25:24.264 --> 01:25:26.025]  It's the way to implement a world tax.
[01:25:26.025 --> 01:25:28.246]  There's no question about that's what it is.
[01:25:28.246 --> 01:25:30.706]  And you implement a world tax, a world bank will work.
[01:25:30.706 --> 01:25:32.187]  Without a world tax, it don't work.
[01:25:33.024 --> 01:25:34.485]  So you have to have that.
[01:25:34.485 --> 01:25:40.707]  The Federal Reserve System was implemented in 1916, and the Federal Income Tax was implemented at the same time.
[01:25:40.707 --> 01:25:47.929]  Because the Federal Reserve System has to lend the money to the government, but the government has to be able to tax the money away from the people in order to pay back the interest.
[01:25:48.223 --> 01:25:50.325]  To service this debt.
[01:25:50.325 --> 01:25:51.726]  How do you think the machine works?
[01:25:51.726 --> 01:25:54.068]  You want to take away the power from the elite?
[01:25:54.068 --> 01:25:55.469]  You kill that system.
[01:25:55.469 --> 01:26:02.495]  There's only one way to do it, because if you take it away from them and you allow the system to keep up, they'll buy it back the next day.
[01:26:02.495 --> 01:26:07.419]  You have to take away that mechanism in order to stop this craziness.
[01:26:07.419 --> 01:26:08.420]  That's bottom line.
[01:26:08.420 --> 01:26:10.242]  So if you want to pick up that book, it's 800-686-8000.
[01:26:13.165 --> 01:26:13.185]  2237.
[01:26:13.185 --> 01:26:15.766]  I suggest everybody read it if you haven't.
[01:26:15.766 --> 01:26:18.827]  If you have read it, get a copy and give it to somebody who needs it.
[01:26:18.827 --> 01:26:21.448]  We all know that there's people out there that have been asking questions.
[01:26:21.448 --> 01:26:24.489]  They're all asking questions as to what happened to the economy.
[01:26:24.489 --> 01:26:27.270]  We all had our little holiday parties and so on and so forth.
[01:26:27.270 --> 01:26:29.151]  The topic is economics.
[01:26:29.151 --> 01:26:33.212]  Right now, while the topic's hot, get this thing in the hands of people.
[01:26:33.212 --> 01:26:33.552]  Period.
[01:26:34.639 --> 01:26:35.959]  That's all I have.
[01:26:35.959 --> 01:26:36.640]  All right, Ted.
[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:38.160]  Ted Anderson of Midas Resources.
[01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:38.520]  He's right.
[01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:40.681]  The Creature from Jekyll Island is amazing.
[01:26:40.681 --> 01:26:46.402]  If you're part of that YouTube culture, give your parents, your cousins, your friends a taste.
[01:26:46.402 --> 01:26:47.123]  Go to YouTube.
[01:26:47.123 --> 01:26:49.403]  Pick up a little section on one of his lectures.
[01:26:49.403 --> 01:26:50.924]  Say, hey, take a look at this.
[01:26:50.924 --> 01:26:53.024]  This is why the economy tanked.
[01:26:53.024 --> 01:26:54.345]  And it's going to continue to do so.
[01:26:54.345 --> 01:26:58.806]  And they're going to continue to re-regulate until they have even more control over our lives.
[01:26:59.466 --> 01:27:03.328]  Before we get Marty Schachter up here in a few moments, let's go through a few more calls.
[01:27:03.328 --> 01:27:07.109]  Then we're going to have Larry Pratt of Gun Owners of America on later.
[01:27:07.109 --> 01:27:12.671]  And then of course we're going to be talking about the re-regulation of food with Jonas Stolfitz and Maurice Thompson.
[01:27:12.671 --> 01:27:15.072]  SWAT teams going into local farm or something.
[01:27:15.072 --> 01:27:16.873]  That kind of hits home for me.
[01:27:16.873 --> 01:27:18.614]  Not only Mennonites being taken over, but
[01:27:19.804 --> 01:27:27.829]  You know, where I live in upstate New York, there's a large Amish population, and my house is in this parking lot.
[01:27:27.829 --> 01:27:36.195]  It's got the Save-A-Lot in it, and the Family Dollar, all very lowbrow stuff, but in the parking lot, the Amish park there, and they often sell their produce there.
[01:27:36.195 --> 01:27:40.738]  And if you want the freshest vegetables, you usually get them from the Amish people.
[01:27:40.738 --> 01:27:45.261]  Alright, let's see if we've still got Neil in South Dakota.
[01:27:45.261 --> 01:27:48.523]  Neil, are you on?
[01:27:48.523 --> 01:27:49.124]  Neil, what's on your mind?
[01:27:50.114 --> 01:27:51.035]  A couple things, actually.
[01:27:51.035 --> 01:27:56.981]  I just woke up, so to speak, here a few weeks ago, my wife and I, and scrambling to learn all we can.
[01:27:56.981 --> 01:28:06.010]  A couple quick questions we've got regarding gold and silver is, you know, in a barter society, it seems like a silver denomination would be better, you know, the smaller the better.
[01:28:06.010 --> 01:28:10.395]  As far as investment purposes, you know, it seems like gold would perhaps be a better way to go.
[01:28:10.395 --> 01:28:11.236]  What's your thoughts on that?
[01:28:11.604 --> 01:28:13.686]  Well, that's a very good point.
[01:28:13.686 --> 01:28:24.597]  You can get the silver pieces that are marked $10 and $20, so obviously if you're just trying to get across a border or get from state to state or get small goods and services, the silver is great to have.
[01:28:24.597 --> 01:28:30.604]  Now gold, one ounce, no matter what it's trading at, you usually can't get it for less than
[01:28:31.084 --> 01:28:33.907]  Maybe a less than a thousand dollars online on eBay.
[01:28:33.907 --> 01:28:35.448]  You know, that's what I usually go to.
[01:28:35.448 --> 01:28:40.552]  eBay usually has some pretty low prices and it gives you a good idea what you're going to pay for.
[01:28:40.552 --> 01:28:42.894]  Now, you don't always have to get an ounce of gold.
[01:28:42.894 --> 01:28:52.382]  So, you know, if you're rocking a Ben Franklin in your wallet, a hundred dollar bill, maybe if you get a fifth ounce piece, you know, that'll be a couple hundred dollars or worth maybe two fifty.
[01:28:52.382 --> 01:28:55.845]  So that's a barter type denomination.
[01:28:55.845 --> 01:28:56.486]  I agree.
[01:28:56.486 --> 01:28:57.927]  Gold obviously has
[01:28:59.148 --> 01:29:00.029]  Okay, that sounds great.
[01:29:00.029 --> 01:29:01.089]  If I can jump topics real quick on you.
[01:29:24.068 --> 01:29:31.253]  One of the things we've been struggling with is trying to figure out what to do with a concealed carry.
[01:29:31.253 --> 01:29:33.915]  We're new gun owners and we're told different things.
[01:29:33.915 --> 01:29:37.857]  I'll tell you what, we'll take that up with Larry Pratt when he comes on at 1 o'clock.
[01:29:37.857 --> 01:29:39.338]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:29:39.338 --> 01:29:42.520]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, TruthNews.us.
[01:29:51.357 --> 01:29:52.738]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.738 --> 01:29:54.359]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.359 --> 01:30:02.886]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:02.886 --> 01:30:06.949]  Gentlemen, I know you need no reminder that Valentine's Day is right around the corner.
[01:30:06.949 --> 01:30:09.371]  Obviously, you have the perfect gift in mind.
[01:30:09.371 --> 01:30:15.936]  Well, just in case you might, ahem, know someone that may need some gift ideas, tell them about EnduringRose.com.
[01:30:15.936 --> 01:30:18.438]  We all know that flowers are a woman's favorite gift.

[01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:25.804]  EnduringRose.com has taken this gift and made it into one that will endure and last forever.

[01:30:55.264 --> 01:30:59.628]  That's 702-453-7455.
[01:30:59.628 --> 01:31:04.293]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history.
[01:31:04.293 --> 01:31:07.776]  A terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:31:07.776 --> 01:31:09.438]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:31:10.396 --> 01:31:11.937]  But who is the enemy?
[01:31:11.937 --> 01:31:12.737]  Bin Laden.
[01:31:12.737 --> 01:31:13.738]  This is his M.O.
[01:31:13.738 --> 01:31:15.119]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:31:15.119 --> 01:31:17.100]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:31:17.100 --> 01:31:24.244]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:31:24.244 --> 01:31:24.744]  Some U.S.
[01:31:24.744 --> 01:31:30.388]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:31:31.068 --> 01:31:34.591]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:31:34.591 --> 01:31:37.393]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:32:01.602 --> 01:32:04.471]  Now that the election is over and the shock is beginning to wear off...

[01:33:29.992 --> 01:33:31.452]  All right, folks, we are back.
[01:33:31.452 --> 01:33:36.414]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:36.414 --> 01:33:42.635]  Man, it's pretty crazy, this whole financial crisis.
[01:33:42.635 --> 01:33:43.735]  Who knows what's going to happen?
[01:33:43.735 --> 01:33:45.736]  I don't know if Obama's given his speech yet.
[01:33:45.736 --> 01:33:51.657]  I hope the fans are out there taping and getting ready to send that information to us.
[01:33:51.657 --> 01:33:54.558]  Right now, I want to shift gears a little bit.
[01:33:56.269 --> 01:33:59.932]  And talking about one of our great sponsors, Cal Bend Soap.
[01:33:59.932 --> 01:34:03.455]  Now every time I come out to Texas, this is the soap that I use.
[01:34:03.455 --> 01:34:06.077]  It's the soap that Aaron's got in the house.
[01:34:06.077 --> 01:34:08.879]  It's all around the office, the dry stuff as well.
[01:34:08.879 --> 01:34:10.621]  And it's just pure natural soap.
[01:34:10.621 --> 01:34:12.843]  It's got no odors, no dyes.
[01:34:12.843 --> 01:34:15.865]  It's actually pretty healthy for you and it works tremendously well.
[01:34:15.865 --> 01:34:19.228]  I was hooked on it over the summer while I was here working on Fabled Enemies.
[01:34:19.228 --> 01:34:23.171]  And to tell you about that soap, we have Marty the Soap Man Schachter.
[01:34:23.171 --> 01:34:23.832]  Marty, are you with us?
[01:34:24.820 --> 01:34:26.361]  Hi, good morning, Jason.
[01:34:26.361 --> 01:34:27.741]  Pleasure talking to you.
[01:34:27.741 --> 01:34:29.902]  It's been a year, hasn't it?
[01:34:29.902 --> 01:34:31.042]  Um, just about that.
[01:34:31.042 --> 01:34:31.442]  I'm not sure.
[01:34:31.442 --> 01:34:35.184]  I might've had you over the summer, so maybe like six to eight months, but it has been a while, hasn't it?
[01:34:35.184 --> 01:34:39.265]  It was last year, that's for sure.
[01:34:39.265 --> 01:34:42.466]  So Marty, why don't you tell the good people out there about your product?
[01:34:42.466 --> 01:34:45.287]  I mean, again, this is healthy, safe soap.
[01:34:45.287 --> 01:34:48.188]  It doesn't have all these dyes and chemicals in it, does it?
[01:34:48.188 --> 01:34:52.930]  But we're talking about homeland cleanliness and we're talking about value.
[01:34:53.922 --> 01:34:58.703]  We've been manufacturing since 1947.
[01:34:58.703 --> 01:35:14.786]  In 1947, my father and I started a very small family-owned, family-operated company with one goal in mind, to give the finest, highest quality and value to the consumer.
[01:35:14.786 --> 01:35:21.828]  We've achieved that, and with Alex Jones behind us, we know we've got something that is great.
[01:35:23.402 --> 01:35:23.802]  I agree.
[01:35:23.802 --> 01:35:28.444]  You know, anything that Alex promotes, he not only believes in, but he uses.
[01:35:28.444 --> 01:35:31.486]  And you know, that's why the guys in the office are the ones that turned me on to this.
[01:35:31.486 --> 01:35:33.267]  Where can people get this product?
[01:35:33.267 --> 01:35:39.049]  Well, first of all, we sell factory direct, and I'll give you my toll-free number.
[01:35:39.049 --> 01:35:46.993]  You can get a complete, detailed catalog at no charge, just by a very quick phone call of 1-800-340-7091.
[01:35:53.209 --> 01:36:02.656]  Or you could look us up on the web, which is 5, the letter or the number, 5starsoap.com.
[01:36:02.656 --> 01:36:05.919]  5starsoap.com, I encourage you to go there right now and get some of Marty's soap.
[01:36:05.919 --> 01:36:12.944]  And not only that, you save a lot of money because you're really buying it in bulk and it lasts a lot longer than what you pay for in the store, correct?
[01:36:12.944 --> 01:36:15.366]  Well, let's talk about the stimulus packages.
[01:36:15.366 --> 01:36:21.610]  The stimulus packages are a one to two year supply, which weighs out at 65 pounds.
[01:36:23.118 --> 01:36:26.759]  Is equal to a thousand pounds of detergents.
[01:36:26.759 --> 01:36:29.760]  That comes out to three dollars a week.
[01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:38.224]  A three to four year supply, which weighs out at a hundred and forty five pounds, is equal to two thousand pounds of detergents.
[01:36:38.224 --> 01:36:40.865]  Comes out to two fifty per week.
[01:36:40.865 --> 01:36:42.925]  Two dollars and fifty cents.
[01:36:42.925 --> 01:36:44.746]  We want to go into real bulk.
[01:36:44.746 --> 01:36:48.327]  We're talking a four to five year supply.
[01:36:48.327 --> 01:36:50.008]  Two hundred and ten pounds.
[01:36:50.646 --> 01:36:58.754]  Equal to 3,000 pounds of harmful, disastrous detergents, $2 per week.
[01:36:58.754 --> 01:37:00.155]  What's it costing you now?
[01:37:00.155 --> 01:37:03.178]  This is a true consumer bailout.
[01:37:03.178 --> 01:37:10.005]  We'll bail you out of those detergents, those chemicals, those unbelievable products.
[01:37:10.005 --> 01:37:14.169]  Our satisfaction is guaranteed or double your dirt back.
[01:37:16.798 --> 01:37:20.321]  And folks, again, I mean you can't get this stuff anywhere else.
[01:37:20.321 --> 01:37:22.583]  You need to go to 5starsoap.com.
[01:37:22.583 --> 01:37:33.891]  It actually, like I said, it feels different on your skin because you're not getting, you know, when you crack open a zest or an iris spring, immediately you know that they put some kind of cologne in there, some kind of dye.
[01:37:33.891 --> 01:37:36.533]  I mean, it has a weird color, it has a weird smell.
[01:37:36.533 --> 01:37:39.095]  And this stuff is just straight up pure soap.
[01:37:39.095 --> 01:37:40.376]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[01:37:40.376 --> 01:37:42.198]  It's great to wash your hands with.
[01:37:42.198 --> 01:37:43.599]  It's great to do your laundry with.
[01:37:43.599 --> 01:37:44.900]  And for these prices,
[01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:52.846]  You can really ensure, you know, if the economy does set, you know, tank, that you can at least keep your clothes clean for the next year to five years.
[01:37:52.846 --> 01:37:55.408]  FiveStarSoap.com, Marty.
[01:37:55.408 --> 01:37:57.029]  Marty, why don't you give us a limerick?
[01:37:57.029 --> 01:38:00.652]  We love your limericks here at the InfoWars.com office.
[01:38:00.652 --> 01:38:08.238]  Well, I've got one that's actually popular demand has made me do this again.
[01:38:08.238 --> 01:38:12.501]  It starts out, a bee's a busy little soul.
[01:38:13.507 --> 01:38:16.153]  He has no time for birth control.
[01:38:16.153 --> 01:38:22.707]  That is why, in times like these, we have so many sons of bees.
[01:38:26.500 --> 01:38:28.662]  Oh, Marty Schachter, we love having you on.
[01:38:28.662 --> 01:38:30.723]  We love having you on as a sponsor.
[01:38:30.723 --> 01:38:33.265]  I mean, you really do make this show possible.
[01:38:33.265 --> 01:38:37.689]  We reach so many people, and that's why we can get behind products like 5 Star Soap.
[01:38:37.689 --> 01:38:39.350]  It's a real, pure soap.
[01:38:39.350 --> 01:38:43.193]  That's why we can get behind products like a Cola Blue that's real water.
[01:38:43.193 --> 01:38:46.375]  It's really nice to get yourself out of the system of control, Marty.
[01:38:46.375 --> 01:38:46.836]  Don't you agree?
[01:38:47.691 --> 01:38:48.852]  I agree a hundred percent.
[01:38:48.852 --> 01:38:51.854]  I wonder if we have time for a eulogy.
[01:38:51.854 --> 01:38:56.017]  Absolutely, and give us that 800 number right before that eulogy.
[01:38:56.017 --> 01:39:00.580]  1-800-340-7091.
[01:39:00.580 --> 01:39:01.601]  Waiting for your call.
[01:39:01.601 --> 01:39:06.885]  My whole family's working here today, and we're anxious to talk to you.
[01:39:06.885 --> 01:39:08.526]  All right, give that eulogy.
[01:39:08.526 --> 01:39:16.591]  Well, Julius Caesar, written by William Shakespeare, wrote a eulogy for Julius Caesar, and this
[01:39:17.648 --> 01:39:25.013]  Mark Anthony relating this, and it's with apologies to William Shakespeare, because I rewrote it.
[01:39:25.013 --> 01:39:28.375]  It's Act 3, Scene 1.
[01:39:28.375 --> 01:39:34.959]  Friends, listeners, countrymen, lend me your ears.
[01:39:34.959 --> 01:39:39.462]  I come to bury detergents, not to praise them.
[01:39:39.462 --> 01:39:42.504]  The evil they do lives after them.
[01:39:42.504 --> 01:39:45.266]  The good has yet to be found.
[01:39:45.266 --> 01:39:46.507]  Our dearly departed,
[01:39:46.946 --> 01:39:48.847]  Was whiter than white!
[01:39:48.847 --> 01:39:50.408]  Cleaner than clean!
[01:39:50.408 --> 01:39:51.549]  Superior!
[01:39:51.549 --> 01:39:53.029]  Intensified!
[01:39:53.029 --> 01:39:54.270]  Fortified!
[01:39:54.270 --> 01:39:55.571]  Controlled!
[01:39:55.571 --> 01:39:57.152]  Newly improved!
[01:39:57.152 --> 01:39:58.432]  Triple strength!
[01:39:58.432 --> 01:39:59.793]  A new dimension!
[01:39:59.793 --> 01:40:01.354]  A white tornado!
[01:40:01.354 --> 01:40:02.515]  Condensed!
[01:40:02.515 --> 01:40:03.355]  Bold!
[01:40:03.355 --> 01:40:04.836]  Full strength!
[01:40:04.836 --> 01:40:05.376]  Daily!
[01:40:05.376 --> 01:40:08.198]  Mobile screaming airwaves!
[01:40:08.198 --> 01:40:10.299]  And media has told you!
[01:40:10.299 --> 01:40:12.500]  Stronger than dirt!
[01:40:12.500 --> 01:40:13.641]  Enzymes!
[01:40:13.641 --> 01:40:14.881]  Eat the dirt away!
[01:40:14.881 --> 01:40:15.602]  Tis true!
[01:40:16.328 --> 01:40:19.851]  But what of the destruction this strength engulfs?
[01:40:19.851 --> 01:40:26.155]  You gave us commercials unheard of, promises and dreams unsurpassed.
[01:40:26.155 --> 01:40:31.900]  Now, you're down the drain, but you just won't stop foaming.
[01:40:31.900 --> 01:40:33.521]  What does it all mean?
[01:40:33.521 --> 01:40:41.067]  Words without meaning, meaning without worth, worth without value, value without truth.
[01:40:41.067 --> 01:40:43.528]  We all used you so.
[01:40:43.528 --> 01:40:44.089]  Remember,
[01:40:44.642 --> 01:40:56.684]  Cold water, all power, known affectionately by its world-famous initials, C-W-A-P, CWAP.
[01:40:56.684 --> 01:41:08.207]  Remember when Procter took a gamble and gave the whole country the biz and shouted to our consumed consumers, our gain is your loss.
[01:41:08.207 --> 01:41:13.748]  Remember when Arthur Godfrey got fired off the networks for spelling dial backwards?
[01:41:14.813 --> 01:41:18.215]  Remember when everyone was spelling Saratan backwards?
[01:41:18.215 --> 01:41:20.537]  And Tide said, me too!
[01:41:20.537 --> 01:41:21.438]  Eat it!
[01:41:21.438 --> 01:41:25.180]  But nobody would except Lake Erie may it rest in peace.
[01:41:25.180 --> 01:41:31.585]  Remember when that dove flew into Mary's kitchen and no one put newspapers down on the floor?
[01:41:31.585 --> 01:41:33.566]  You know how those doves are.
[01:41:33.566 --> 01:41:43.213]  Now, our joy, thrill, cheer, all, bald, pollutes, destroys, corrodes, harms,
[01:41:43.746 --> 01:41:46.148]  And heavily cost.
[01:41:46.148 --> 01:41:53.633]  Oh beautiful for spacious suns with happy snappy dames.
[01:41:53.633 --> 01:41:58.396]  You gave us operas written by Johann Sebastian Axador.
[01:41:58.396 --> 01:42:06.961]  Foaming lakes, dead fish, itching, burning skin, rusting machines, lint.
[01:42:06.961 --> 01:42:10.944]  Can we ever bury you without destroying our groundwater?
[01:42:11.508 --> 01:42:14.349]  Drown you without polluting our oceans?
[01:42:14.349 --> 01:42:16.370]  Burn you without smog?
[01:42:16.370 --> 01:42:20.152]  Can we truly legislate you out of existence?
[01:42:20.152 --> 01:42:23.273]  I speak to disprove what the powers preach.
[01:42:23.273 --> 01:42:24.954]  I speak what I know.
[01:42:24.954 --> 01:42:28.055]  We gave you the shirt off our backs.
[01:42:28.055 --> 01:42:30.436]  Look what you gave us in return.
[01:42:30.436 --> 01:42:32.177]  You were that shiny knight.
[01:42:32.177 --> 01:42:34.117]  That Mr. Clean Giant.
[01:42:34.117 --> 01:42:35.658]  That nine-foot machine.
[01:42:35.658 --> 01:42:39.379]  We all did love real soap once.
[01:42:39.379 --> 01:42:40.460]  Not without cause.
[01:42:41.041 --> 01:42:51.987]  For natural soap shall come back now, and in the future, in all its glory, without hurting, killing, destroying, deteriorating!
[01:42:51.987 --> 01:43:04.934]  I hereby declare that all boxes of detergents shall be its own coffin, and that our legacy shall go on with this fitting inscription on your tombstone I gave
[01:43:05.376 --> 01:43:12.525]  To my beloved country that has the best of everything, the finest pollution money can buy.
[01:43:12.525 --> 01:43:13.787]  Thank you.
[01:43:13.787 --> 01:43:13.847]  1-800-340-7091
[01:43:24.813 --> 01:43:26.574]  All right, thank you so much for coming on the show.
[01:43:26.574 --> 01:43:30.097]  It's Marty Schachter, 5starsoap.com, folks.
[01:43:30.097 --> 01:43:34.921]  All right, in the remaining, I guess before 1 o'clock, we're going to go to prisonplanet.tv.
[01:43:34.921 --> 01:43:36.162]  Remember, that's why you get a membership.
[01:43:36.162 --> 01:43:48.533]  Not only do you get this daily show for two hours of live TV web broadcast, but you also get Alex Jones' weekly access shows, you get his top interviews, you get all of his films, you get my films.
[01:43:48.533 --> 01:43:50.014]  It's an unbelievable deal.
[01:43:50.014 --> 01:43:52.316]  You get other great films like JFK II, The Bush Connection.
[01:43:52.896 --> 01:43:58.260]  So, you know, PrisonPlanet.TV, we really need your support.
[01:43:58.260 --> 01:44:02.303]  I guess we're going to have to wait until the second hour, but I really do want to play that Metallica video.
[01:44:02.303 --> 01:44:03.624]  It's really long.
[01:44:03.624 --> 01:44:07.727]  And we're going to wait until we go to the TV so you guys can check it out over on the web.
[01:44:07.727 --> 01:44:09.508]  Let's take a couple more calls.
[01:44:09.508 --> 01:44:12.150]  Let's go to Matt in New Jersey.
[01:44:12.150 --> 01:44:12.931]  Matt, what's on your mind?
[01:44:13.982 --> 01:44:15.364]  I appreciate you taking the call.
[01:44:15.364 --> 01:44:17.106]  I've been trying to get through to you guys for a while.
[01:44:17.106 --> 01:44:30.423]  Hey, I just wanted to reiterate to you a little bit about propaganda because I believe that that is what is keeping this whole mass, you know, metastasization of cancer alive and it's the only thing that
[01:44:31.003 --> 01:44:31.604]  I don't know.
[01:44:31.604 --> 01:44:32.104]  I don't know.
[01:44:50.314 --> 01:44:55.096]  This video is trying to say almost like these chemtrails are a good thing.
[01:44:55.096 --> 01:44:55.757]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:44:55.757 --> 01:44:56.717]  Have you seen the video?
[01:44:56.717 --> 01:44:57.938]  And by the way, you're a little loud.
[01:44:57.938 --> 01:44:59.779]  Can you just turn it down a little bit?
[01:44:59.779 --> 01:45:01.880]  Yeah, have you seen the video for All Nightmare Long?
[01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:06.742]  Basically, it talks about how the Soviets are trying to zombify the population.
[01:45:06.742 --> 01:45:15.306]  And the reason that there's high levels of barium and arsenic in the chemtrails, because they start playing news clips, is because that's what suppresses the zombification.
[01:45:15.306 --> 01:45:19.268]  And they basically are saying that the chemtrails are there to protect us.
[01:45:20.163 --> 01:45:23.824]  Right, so, you know, I'm sorry if I'm talking loud, just tell me again.
[01:45:23.824 --> 01:45:24.645]  No, you're good now.
[01:45:24.645 --> 01:45:26.245]  Your level's a lot better.
[01:45:26.245 --> 01:45:35.109]  Okay, so basically, you know, I don't know which, who it was, if it was Leonardo da Vinci or some Greek, some philosopher that had said if you can control the music,
[01:45:35.709 --> 01:45:37.430]  Then you can control the society.
[01:45:37.430 --> 01:45:46.857]  So, what I just wanted to reiterate was that propaganda is going on all the time through music and through these morons that are producing their music.
[01:45:46.857 --> 01:46:00.906]  And a lot of people don't realize because, you know, hey, I love Metallica's music, man, but, you know, I woke up from you and your efforts and Alex Jones, you know, only the last couple months I've done hours and hours of research and, you know, I realized that, you know, these guys are
[01:46:01.406 --> 01:46:06.590]  Or working with the Illuminati, and they're working with their cause, and they're supported and funded by these people.
[01:46:06.590 --> 01:46:08.011]  I mean, I don't know.
[01:46:08.011 --> 01:46:13.595]  I'm going to say that that's what I believe, and that's why I believe that these guys produce that propaganda.
[01:46:13.595 --> 01:46:26.505]  And if you listen to the new album, I mean, the new album is probably the greatest musical piece that they've ever done, but if you listen to the words, you can see what these people are trying to put into children's heads.
[01:46:27.506 --> 01:46:31.391]  For one, let's just talk about the song on Nightmare Long, and I thank you for the call.
[01:46:31.391 --> 01:46:38.282]  I mean, obviously, you know, music and culture is promoted by these people, you know, especially the rap culture.
[01:46:38.282 --> 01:46:39.624]  I mean, and I like a lot of rap.
[01:46:39.624 --> 01:46:41.387]  I'm a huge Wu-Tang Clan fan, all that stuff.
[01:46:44.548 --> 01:46:51.253]  In All Nightmare Long, they have a line in there, you know, the light that is not light is here to come and flush you out with your own fear.
[01:46:51.253 --> 01:46:56.117]  You hide, you hide, but null is found, you know, and basically you give up.
[01:46:56.117 --> 01:47:02.622]  And then it's also, you know, feel us breathe upon your face, feel us shift every move we trace.
[01:47:02.622 --> 01:47:06.966]  So it does have those undertones, maybe even overtones, I would say, of...
[01:47:08.727 --> 01:47:11.570]  I don't know, exposing, I guess, this system.
[01:47:11.570 --> 01:47:16.033]  And then, I remember Kill Em All, they had the Four Horsemen, it was all about the apocalypse.
[01:47:16.033 --> 01:47:19.936]  They've had anti-New World Order stuff in their songs before.
[01:47:19.936 --> 01:47:23.279]  And, you know, it seems like they do promote the war.
[01:47:23.279 --> 01:47:26.241]  I mean, their first video is, you know, an Iraqi insurgent.
[01:47:26.241 --> 01:47:28.643]  We're not going to be playing that one.
[01:47:28.643 --> 01:47:31.866]  Basically, the troops are there to help under this high-stress situation.
[01:47:31.866 --> 01:47:33.727]  They don't actually shoot anybody.
[01:47:33.727 --> 01:47:35.549]  I don't know if I disagree or agree with you.
[01:47:35.549 --> 01:47:36.510]  I mean, obviously,
[01:47:37.150 --> 01:47:42.512]  Popular culture is used by the globalists to... I mean, look at Obama.
[01:47:42.512 --> 01:47:44.693]  It's all about... I mean, Oprah Winfrey.
[01:47:44.693 --> 01:47:45.653]  They used Oprah.
[01:47:45.653 --> 01:47:47.694]  You know, Oprah, first black man.
[01:47:47.694 --> 01:47:48.414]  Let's use Oprah.
[01:47:48.414 --> 01:47:49.714]  Oprah will promote this guy.
[01:47:49.714 --> 01:47:50.655]  He's well-spoken.
[01:47:50.655 --> 01:47:52.055]  He seems reasonable.
[01:47:52.055 --> 01:47:57.777]  He's gonna... He's gonna follow the same script of all these guys.
[01:47:57.777 --> 01:48:00.798]  Only he's here to unite us under conscription.
[01:48:00.798 --> 01:48:04.380]  Alright, let's go to John in Michigan.
[01:48:04.380 --> 01:48:05.240]  John, what's on your mind?
[01:48:06.411 --> 01:48:07.232]  What's going on?
[01:48:07.232 --> 01:48:07.892]  Hello?
[01:48:07.892 --> 01:48:09.033]  Yes, you're on.
[01:48:09.033 --> 01:48:10.154]  Hey, what's going on, Jason?
[01:48:10.154 --> 01:48:11.835]  It's a pleasure to finally talk to you.
[01:48:11.835 --> 01:48:16.838]  I've been a big fan of what you and Alex Jones have done for a long, long time.
[01:48:16.838 --> 01:48:20.641]  I couldn't have actually had a better setup, you know?
[01:48:20.641 --> 01:48:22.022]  I have an independent record label.
[01:48:22.022 --> 01:48:32.609]  Actually, what we do is hip-hop music, and we really, really, really try to bring, you know, light to the situation, to try to wake people up, like I was woke up through Road to Tyranny.
[01:48:32.609 --> 01:48:34.310]  And I don't know why
[01:48:34.855 --> 01:48:41.980]  It seems like we can't get together and fight what they do the same way with our truth.
[01:48:41.980 --> 01:48:47.323]  You, Alex, maybe people like Immortal Technique, he may be a little bit harsh, but what he says is just, you know...
[01:48:47.779 --> 01:48:49.981]  He's so intelligent and he speaks the truth.
[01:48:49.981 --> 01:48:52.344]  Why can't he get together and do like a tour?
[01:49:09.682 --> 01:49:12.683]  You know, I read the Rolling Stones Top 100 Albums.
[01:49:12.683 --> 01:49:16.264]  They put Chinese Democracy in the Top 10.
[01:49:16.264 --> 01:49:18.385]  And the Flo-Bots were nowhere to be seen.
[01:49:18.385 --> 01:49:24.867]  You know, these guys had an out of nowhere hit, the album was politically relevant, and it just gets squashed.
[01:49:24.867 --> 01:49:26.608]  They made enough money with them, we're going to put it on the shelf.
[01:49:26.608 --> 01:49:28.628]  Same with Immortal Technique.
[01:49:28.628 --> 01:49:29.829]  The Third World, which is a...
[01:49:30.808 --> 01:49:32.189]  Really not even a full album.
[01:49:32.189 --> 01:49:37.672]  It's a mixtape he put out with Rebel Arms and Green Lantern, one of the biggest hip-hop DJs out there.
[01:49:37.672 --> 01:49:38.993]  It's awesome!
[01:49:38.993 --> 01:49:42.235]  Nine out of my ten friends don't even know it exists.
[01:49:42.235 --> 01:49:43.696]  I'll be playing in the car, they're like, who's this?
[01:49:43.696 --> 01:49:49.559]  I'm like, this is Immortal Technique, he goes on tour with Method Man, he's a really talented rapper, Revolutionary Volume 1 and 2.
[01:49:50.780 --> 01:49:52.862]  They've heard a couple of his songs, maybe.
[01:49:52.862 --> 01:49:56.606]  But it's because the powers that be will not get behind this.
[01:49:56.606 --> 01:49:57.086]  You know, St.
[01:49:57.086 --> 01:49:58.387]  Paris is a talented guy.
[01:49:58.387 --> 01:49:59.488]  You know what I mean?
[01:49:59.488 --> 01:50:12.561]  And it seems when even a mainline rapper tries to take on the establishment with a politically relevant song like Eminem, literally at the time, in 2004, the biggest rapper in the entire world, he does mosh.
[01:50:13.001 --> 01:50:13.341]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:50:13.341 --> 01:50:15.664]  Like I said, I've been trying to do this for years.
[01:50:15.664 --> 01:50:17.565]  That's what we do at Primal Rage.
[01:50:36.516 --> 01:50:38.857]  But you guys don't get the mainstream play.
[01:50:38.857 --> 01:50:41.098]  Through the internet and everything else, you can spread the word.
[01:50:41.098 --> 01:50:45.480]  And if you get the people to come out to the show... Matt, we'll come back to you on the other side.
[01:50:45.480 --> 01:50:46.581]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:50:46.581 --> 01:50:48.122]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:51:07.563 --> 01:51:09.464]  The time clock is ticking.
[01:51:09.464 --> 01:51:10.784]  Laws could change.
[01:51:10.784 --> 01:51:13.545]  The New World Order is advancing rapidly.
[01:51:13.545 --> 01:51:16.025]  Health consciousness is fading away.
[01:51:16.025 --> 01:51:21.527]  Junk food, fast food, fat food is the New World Order's game.
[01:51:21.527 --> 01:51:23.447]  Don't play the game!
[01:51:23.447 --> 01:51:29.769]  Slim down, detox, and cleanse yourself from the chemical foods and processed food that we intake daily.
[01:51:29.989 --> 01:51:31.570]  And now for the holiday special.
[01:51:31.570 --> 01:51:35.071]  Buy one month of Super Tee and we'll throw in an extra two weeks.
[01:51:35.071 --> 01:51:35.971]  That's right.
[01:51:35.971 --> 01:51:39.112]  One month of Super Tee and we'll throw in an extra two weeks.
[01:51:39.112 --> 01:51:41.273]  It won't last long, so order now.
[01:51:41.273 --> 01:51:43.013]  GetTheTee.com.
[01:51:43.013 --> 01:51:45.774]  That's GetTheTee.com.
[01:51:45.774 --> 01:51:46.855]  Or call us at 928-308-0408.
[01:51:46.855 --> 01:51:47.295]  That's 928-308-0408.
[01:51:47.295 --> 01:51:48.675]  Order now before you can't.
[01:52:01.292 --> 01:52:06.997]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[01:52:06.997 --> 01:52:08.338]  And we knew what to do.
[01:52:08.338 --> 01:52:10.340]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:52:10.340 --> 01:52:17.366]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:52:17.366 --> 01:52:25.893]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[01:52:26.277 --> 01:52:33.361]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[01:52:33.361 --> 01:52:36.542]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:52:36.542 --> 01:52:42.306]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:52:42.306 --> 01:52:45.387]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[01:52:45.387 --> 01:52:52.371]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD
[01:53:00.735 --> 01:53:08.978]  This year, many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future.
[01:53:08.978 --> 01:53:13.539]  In these troubled times, one of the most important things your family can have is good health.
[01:53:13.539 --> 01:53:18.201]  Some of the contributors to poor health are parasites, viruses, toxins, and heavy metals.
[01:53:18.201 --> 01:53:19.621]  It's a documented fact.
[01:53:20.021 --> 01:53:27.268]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection.
[01:53:27.268 --> 01:53:39.360]  Now, you can fight internal parasites, heavy metals and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP with your favorite beverage, once a day.
[01:53:39.360 --> 01:53:43.024]  FPP is now available to you from freshwaterorganics.com.
[01:53:43.624 --> 01:53:46.767]  A two-month supply starts at just $17.
[01:53:46.767 --> 01:53:50.490]  FPP is so affordable you can't afford to do without.
[01:53:50.490 --> 01:53:53.793]  Visit FreshwaterOrganics.com or call them toll-free at 888-949-3570.
[01:53:53.793 --> 01:53:53.993]  That's 888-949-3570.
[01:54:04.019 --> 01:54:07.021]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[01:54:07.021 --> 01:54:14.767]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:14.767 --> 01:54:18.890]  We are back, it's the Alex Jones Show and we're talking about, you know, how can we get...
[01:54:22.204 --> 01:54:27.167]  Artists out there, musical artists, on tour with one another to bring this message.
[01:54:27.167 --> 01:54:29.189]  Obviously, we have a ton of them who are awake.
[01:54:29.189 --> 01:54:32.091]  KRS-One, he's coming to Austin, Texas on the 24th.
[01:54:32.091 --> 01:54:35.673]  I believe we had a caller about that yesterday.
[01:54:35.673 --> 01:54:36.213]  That should be great.
[01:54:36.213 --> 01:54:38.395]  We should be getting him on the show.
[01:54:38.395 --> 01:54:40.036]  Obviously, we've had Parris on the program.
[01:54:40.036 --> 01:54:41.957]  We've had Immortal Technique on the program.
[01:54:41.957 --> 01:54:45.159]  Head PE, who's a platinum selling artist.
[01:54:45.159 --> 01:54:47.320]  2003's Blackout went platinum.
[01:54:47.320 --> 01:54:49.682]  They've got an album out today called New World Orphans.
[01:54:50.342 --> 01:54:53.043]  And that's off of SubNoise Records.
[01:54:53.043 --> 01:54:54.284]  You know, they're very well aware.
[01:54:54.284 --> 01:54:57.225]  They hand out literature at their shows.
[01:54:57.225 --> 01:54:59.666]  There's a lot of them out there, but why can't we get it together?
[01:54:59.666 --> 01:55:04.828]  Well, a lot of them are owned by separate labels or they're independents, and then on top of that you have to get past scheduling problems.
[01:55:04.828 --> 01:55:09.430]  But the main underlying issue, I think, Matt, out in Jersey is that
[01:55:10.310 --> 01:55:13.072]  You know, the establishment doesn't want to promote these types of things.
[01:55:13.072 --> 01:55:21.157]  They want to promote concerts like Live 8 where, you know, we can get behind global warming and there's a massive brainwashing taking place there.
[01:55:21.157 --> 01:55:26.560]  You know, it's going to take efforts of people like yourself and others in order to make that happen.
[01:55:26.560 --> 01:55:29.982]  You know, and it's actually John out in Michigan.
[01:55:29.982 --> 01:55:31.283]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:55:31.283 --> 01:55:32.164]  You're right.
[01:55:32.164 --> 01:55:34.025]  And this is what I'm talking about because I face this.
[01:55:34.025 --> 01:55:37.127]  We've been doing this for 10 years and I faced this problem for so long.
[01:55:37.674 --> 01:55:43.957]  And like, just getting on the radio if you have a message and stuff is impossible, especially unless you're signed to a major record deal.
[01:55:43.957 --> 01:55:47.019]  You'll never hear a moral technique in my neck of the woods.
[01:55:47.019 --> 01:55:49.240]  You know, you'll never see your videos in my neck of the woods.
[01:55:49.240 --> 01:55:50.261]  You have to hunt them down.
[01:55:50.683 --> 01:55:52.525]  And this is why we should work together, you know?
[01:55:52.525 --> 01:56:00.052]  This is why when you're out in New York and everything else, we should all band together and try to do it through the internet and try to keep spreading the word.
[01:56:00.052 --> 01:56:03.576]  I mean, if you pull up Immortal Technique, his plays are phenomenal.
[01:56:03.576 --> 01:56:07.079]  He's got over a million views on YouTube and everything else, you know?
[01:56:07.079 --> 01:56:08.681]  And this is awesome.
[01:56:08.681 --> 01:56:09.862]  He's amazing, you know?
[01:56:09.862 --> 01:56:12.565]  And he's a big influence on me and, you know,
[01:56:13.007 --> 01:56:18.148]  I would offer our music to you to use in any of your videos for free.
[01:56:18.148 --> 01:56:19.608]  Awesome, man.
[01:56:19.608 --> 01:56:20.988]  And you know, take a look.
[01:56:20.988 --> 01:56:23.649]  MySpace.com forward slash Promo 8.
[01:56:23.649 --> 01:56:26.770]  P-R-H-Y-M-A-L-R-A-G-E.
[01:56:26.770 --> 01:56:29.190]  Check out B-Roof, The Media.
[01:56:29.190 --> 01:56:32.551]  I'm telling you, it'll blow your mind, but we need to get together and work together.
[01:56:32.551 --> 01:56:40.292]  You know, we need to, me, you, you, people like Immortal Technique need to band together, get our tour out there, sell your guys' movies,
[01:56:40.789 --> 01:56:43.815]  And just work as a cohesive unit.
[01:56:43.815 --> 01:56:47.983]  That's the only way through the internet and through getting people to listen to our stuff.
[01:56:48.365 --> 01:56:49.345]  They are educated.
[01:56:49.345 --> 01:56:53.067]  That's the only way we're going to be able to move forward and actually take down the New World Order.
[01:56:53.067 --> 01:56:54.848]  You've got to be able to... I agree with you, John.
[01:56:54.848 --> 01:57:05.212]  I really think that we do have to ban forces and we have to put our message out in this pop culture society and, you know, put it out there to the youth because the youth are the only ones that are going to change it.
[01:57:05.212 --> 01:57:09.934]  Alright, I've only got time for a couple calls before we go to PrisonPlanet.tv at the top of the hour.
[01:57:09.934 --> 01:57:12.976]  We're going to have Larry Pratt of Gut Owners of America on.
[01:57:12.976 --> 01:57:15.137]  Let's go to Christian in Florida.
[01:57:15.137 --> 01:57:15.977]  Christian, what's on your mind?
[01:57:17.793 --> 01:57:20.134]  You still there, Christian?
[01:57:20.134 --> 01:57:21.715]  All right, let's go to Aaron in Texas.
[01:57:21.715 --> 01:57:22.655]  Aaron, what's on your mind?
[01:57:22.655 --> 01:57:25.697]  Oh, are you there?
[01:57:25.697 --> 01:57:26.617]  Yes, sir.
[01:57:26.617 --> 01:57:27.118]  Oh, hey, Jason.
[01:57:27.118 --> 01:57:27.878]  How you doing?
[01:57:27.878 --> 01:57:28.859]  Good.
[01:57:28.859 --> 01:57:33.541]  I wanted to call about a bit that was on my local news about a week ago.
[01:57:33.541 --> 01:57:37.303]  It said computer tech private investigators in Texas.
[01:57:37.303 --> 01:57:38.603]  Have you heard about this?
[01:57:38.603 --> 01:57:39.904]  Nope.
[01:57:39.904 --> 01:57:43.666]  Okay, it says state lawmakers passed a bill back in 2007.
[01:57:43.666 --> 01:57:47.548]  The representative with the Texas House Committee on Law Enforcement says under the current language,
[01:57:48.211 --> 01:57:53.976]  House Bill 2833 can be interpreted to mean computer techs are required to be privatized.
[01:57:53.976 --> 01:57:57.439]  Oh, you know, Jones did a story about this last year, but continue.
[01:57:57.439 --> 01:58:01.783]  Okay, so they say the bill intended for law enforcement officials, not computer techs.
[01:58:01.783 --> 01:58:05.786]  It was really meant for investigative purposes.
[01:58:05.786 --> 01:58:07.448]  And then it goes on and talks about it, but...
[01:58:09.520 --> 01:58:20.665]  It basically brings a snoop into your home without knowing, and if he sees anything bad on your computer, you know, anything he deems inappropriate, he's going to report you to the Authoritize, and you can be investigated from there.
[01:58:20.665 --> 01:58:22.846]  It's very American, very Orwellian.
[01:58:22.846 --> 01:58:24.907]  I thank you for the call, Christian.
[01:58:24.907 --> 01:58:30.529]  We're going to PrisonPlanet.tv in less than 90 seconds, and we've got Larry Predagon, owners of America, on there.
[01:58:30.529 --> 01:58:33.411]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, TruthNews.us.
[01:58:42.717 --> 01:58:46.118]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:46.118 --> 01:58:51.080]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.080 --> 01:58:51.721]  Hello, friends.
[01:58:51.721 --> 01:58:52.781]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:58:52.781 --> 01:58:57.523]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:58:57.523 --> 01:59:00.484]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:59:00.484 --> 01:59:03.525]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:59:03.525 --> 01:59:08.247]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:59:08.467 --> 01:59:09.607]  If you simply prepare.
[01:59:09.607 --> 01:59:12.849]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:59:12.849 --> 01:59:19.832]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:59:19.832 --> 01:59:23.113]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:59:23.113 --> 01:59:23.373]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[01:59:25.794 --> 01:59:28.256]  Or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:59:28.256 --> 01:59:34.521]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-scribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[01:59:34.521 --> 01:59:38.284]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[01:59:38.284 --> 01:59:39.826]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:59:39.826 --> 01:59:40.266]  Take action today.
[01:59:40.266 --> 01:59:42.087]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:59:53.880 --> 01:59:56.281]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.281 --> 02:00:05.545]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.545 --> 02:00:06.846]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.846 --> 02:00:08.627]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.627 --> 02:00:10.388]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.388 --> 02:00:11.948]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.948 --> 02:00:12.889]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.889 --> 02:00:17.711]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.711 --> 02:00:21.773]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.776 --> 02:00:33.785]  Alright folks, we are live at PrisonPlanet.tv!
[02:00:33.785 --> 02:00:37.690]  And I am just honored to be singing for Alex Jones for a whole week.
[02:00:38.974 --> 02:00:41.295]  And he much deserved vacation.
[02:00:41.295 --> 02:00:43.797]  If you don't know who I am, I'm Jason Bermance.
[02:00:43.797 --> 02:00:47.058]  I've produced a couple films out there, Loose Change being one of them.
[02:00:47.058 --> 02:00:53.581]  I wrote and directed Fabled Enemies, both readily available over at InfoWars.com.
[02:00:53.581 --> 02:00:57.523]  And right now, we've got a guest on from Gun Owners of America.
[02:00:57.523 --> 02:00:59.965]  This guy was heavily involved in the Buchanan
[02:01:01.207 --> 02:01:02.488]  campaign for the presidency.
[02:01:02.488 --> 02:01:08.250]  We played a Buchanan clip earlier today where we have Tom Blankley talking about how we need conscription.
[02:01:08.250 --> 02:01:09.010]  That was back in 2007.
[02:01:09.010 --> 02:01:14.733]  He just launched a book yesterday called Grits where Fox and Friends is praising the idea that we have a
[02:01:16.770 --> 02:01:19.673]  Mandatory military for all people 18 years old and above.
[02:01:19.673 --> 02:01:20.533]  I think it's 18 to 25.
[02:01:20.533 --> 02:01:22.415]  You've got to serve at least two years.
[02:01:22.415 --> 02:01:23.616]  How lovely.
[02:01:23.616 --> 02:01:27.119]  And we also had a caller earlier asking about a carry and conceal permit.
[02:01:27.119 --> 02:01:37.128]  You know, I know it varies from state to state, but in my state of New York, it's almost impossible to get a conceal and carry permit unless you're a, you know, former law officer or a former military officer.
[02:01:37.128 --> 02:01:39.210]  And even then, it's not guaranteed.
[02:01:39.210 --> 02:01:40.330]  So, welcome Larry.
[02:01:40.330 --> 02:01:40.851]  How are you today?
[02:01:45.135 --> 02:01:46.537]  Okay, maybe we don't have him on.
[02:01:46.537 --> 02:01:49.159]  We have somebody in the background there?
[02:01:49.159 --> 02:01:51.221]  Alright, we'll wait one moment.
[02:01:51.221 --> 02:01:53.122]  Um, let's see.
[02:01:53.122 --> 02:02:00.829]  Until we get him on, I want to talk one more time, I guess, about this Obama climate change czar who has socialist ties.
[02:02:02.625 --> 02:02:12.153]  Carol M. Browner, President-elect Barack Obama's pick as Global Warming Czar, was listed as one of 14 leaders of the Socialist Group's Commission for a Sustainable World Society.
[02:02:12.153 --> 02:02:14.855]  That's the Commission for a Sustainable World Society.
[02:02:14.855 --> 02:02:21.141]  Whenever they're calling for a sustainable world society, and people like, you know, Gordon Brown are the heads of it.
[02:02:21.741 --> 02:02:22.882]  You know, we should play that clip.
[02:02:22.882 --> 02:02:23.483]  We got a couple minutes.
[02:02:23.483 --> 02:02:26.786]  Can we play that Gordon Brown New World Order speech again?
[02:02:26.786 --> 02:02:34.393]  You know, Gordon Brown is so pro-world government, it is mind-boggling to me.
[02:02:34.393 --> 02:02:40.199]  It's more than mind-boggling to me that people don't understand that the New World Order is real.
[02:02:40.199 --> 02:02:45.584]  It's on the cover of their newspapers there, and this is him before he's even elected.
[02:02:47.326 --> 02:02:49.932]  You know, this is the guy that's the successor to Tony Blair.
[02:02:49.932 --> 02:02:55.204]  You don't see him in the press as much as you did with Tony, but we only saw Tony because we were in a war crisis.
[02:02:55.204 --> 02:02:55.925]  Let's go to that clip.
[02:02:57.065 --> 02:03:04.510]  About the biggest restructuring we have ever seen, not just of the global economy, but of the global order as a whole.
[02:03:04.510 --> 02:03:13.656]  And 200 years ago, a famous British Foreign Secretary said that the new world had been called into existence to redress the balance of the old.
[02:03:13.656 --> 02:03:17.979]  In 1990, another old world ended, dominated by the Cold War,
[02:03:19.031 --> 02:03:23.092]  And people taught them in 1990 of a new world order.
[02:03:23.092 --> 02:03:25.973]  What they actually meant then was a new political order.
[02:03:25.973 --> 02:03:37.315]  And what was not foreseen then, but is obvious now from everything that we see and do, what we experience in every day of our life, is the sheer scale and speed and scope of globalisation.
[02:03:37.315 --> 02:03:40.896]  And it's only now that we can begin to understand that the world order
[02:03:41.556 --> 02:03:42.677]  We're good to go.
[02:04:03.716 --> 02:04:18.366]  I suggest that the countries that are going to succeed are those that combine flexibility, free trade, open markets, with proper stewardship of the environment and investment in education, infrastructure and innovation.
[02:04:18.366 --> 02:04:32.395]  And the question for us is how we meet and master all these challenges to ensure that Britain enhances its competitiveness in the process and realises what I believe is our destiny of success in this new world order.
[02:04:33.055 --> 02:04:38.357]  So, in conclusion, ladies and gentlemen... Well, there you have it.
[02:04:38.357 --> 02:04:41.979]  He says New World Order, I think, three more times in 20 seconds.
[02:04:41.979 --> 02:04:44.600]  That's what this, you know, sustainable society is about.
[02:04:44.600 --> 02:04:48.542]  It's about a global government, global tax, and that's why Obama appointed this woman.
[02:04:48.542 --> 02:04:49.382]  We'll be back after this.
[02:04:49.382 --> 02:04:50.443]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:04:50.443 --> 02:04:52.004]  I am Jason Vermas, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:05:03.345 --> 02:05:09.087]  With rising unemployment and an economy that continues to fail comes an increase in crime.
[02:05:09.087 --> 02:05:11.368]  Are you safe when you walk to your car?
[02:05:11.368 --> 02:05:13.509]  Are your kids safe when they go out?
[02:05:13.509 --> 02:05:17.511]  Everyone needs something to give that extra edge in case of an attack.
[02:05:17.511 --> 02:05:21.513]  You need DPS pepper spray from MrDefense.com.
[02:05:21.513 --> 02:05:26.715]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray on the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement
[02:05:31.633 --> 02:05:34.394]  A great way to surprise a potential attacker.
[02:05:34.394 --> 02:05:43.037]  Mr. Defense carries the largest selection of stun guns, air tasers, knives, swords, batons, survival spy and tactical gear.

[02:06:01.621 --> 02:06:03.041]  It is a big idea.
[02:06:03.041 --> 02:06:05.862]  A New World Order.
[02:06:05.862 --> 02:06:10.363]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:06:10.363 --> 02:06:13.583]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:06:13.583 --> 02:06:16.364]  Put their objective being world domination.
[02:06:16.364 --> 02:06:19.544]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:06:19.544 --> 02:06:26.866]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:06:29.898 --> 02:06:35.342]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:06:35.342 --> 02:06:39.204]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:06:39.204 --> 02:06:41.786]  Bill of Rights is making great progress for the world government.
[02:06:41.786 --> 02:06:42.947]  Most people have no idea.
[02:06:42.947 --> 02:06:43.747]  They're not after money.
[02:06:43.747 --> 02:06:45.008]  They have all the money they need.
[02:06:45.008 --> 02:06:45.989]  They're after power.
[02:06:45.989 --> 02:06:47.150]  That's what they're after these years.
[02:06:47.150 --> 02:06:55.855]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:06:55.855 --> 02:06:58.677]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:06:58.677 --> 02:06:59.718]  You have been warned.
[02:07:01.259 --> 02:07:05.342]  Do you have aches and pains or suffer from indigestion or inflammation?
[02:07:05.342 --> 02:07:08.043]  Are you tired of feeling restless from insomnia?
[02:07:08.043 --> 02:07:15.408]  These symptoms are produced by negative toxins, but with the correct information, understanding and care, you can cleanse them from your body.
[02:07:15.408 --> 02:07:20.551]  Allomaster.com would like to help you begin the road to recovery with Aloe Vera.

[02:08:02.766 --> 02:08:09.389]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:09.389 --> 02:08:12.371]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:23.641 --> 02:08:25.142]  Alright folks, we are back.
[02:08:25.142 --> 02:08:29.044]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:29.044 --> 02:08:35.147]  And you know, why do I keep harping on global warming?
[02:08:35.147 --> 02:08:39.669]  I think yesterday we ended the show with a clip from the Great Global Warming Swindle.
[02:08:39.669 --> 02:08:42.851]  Or we did that the other day and somebody else called about the Great Global Warming Swindle.
[02:08:44.744 --> 02:08:44.844]  It's
[02:09:05.256 --> 02:09:15.244]  Who is the President of Gun Owners of America, a non-profit lobbying organization formed in 1975 to preserve and defend the Second Amendment rights of gun owners.
[02:09:15.244 --> 02:09:16.565]  See folks, these are the real deal.
[02:09:16.565 --> 02:09:17.426]  They're not the NRA.
[02:09:17.426 --> 02:09:23.551]  They're not all about gun regulation and grabbing your semi-automatic and automatic weapons, but they're pro-Second Amendment.
[02:09:23.551 --> 02:09:25.132]  Larry, thank you for joining me.
[02:09:25.132 --> 02:09:26.493]  Well, it's a pleasure to be with you.
[02:09:26.493 --> 02:09:27.174]  Thanks for having me.
[02:09:28.348 --> 02:09:30.029]  No, thanks for coming on the show.
[02:09:30.029 --> 02:09:38.673]  You know, we had a caller earlier today asking about conceal and carry permits, and I know that it differs from state to state.
[02:09:38.673 --> 02:09:41.274]  You know, in New York, where I live, it's awfully hard to get one.
[02:09:41.274 --> 02:09:44.196]  I believe he was out of South Dakota.
[02:09:44.196 --> 02:09:48.918]  Do you know anything about the regulations there?
[02:09:48.918 --> 02:09:57.642]  As far as conceal carry regulations are concerned, because there are two states that happily have none, you just carry as a matter of right Vermont and Alaska.
[02:09:58.237 --> 02:10:06.404]  But South Dakota is certainly among the most easy to get the permit, and a huge percentage of the population.
[02:10:06.404 --> 02:10:19.454]  At one time, I think there was something like at least a tenth of the adult population has such a permit, which is partly explainable because it has been on the books.
[02:10:19.454 --> 02:10:20.955]  Their law has been on the books so long.
[02:10:20.955 --> 02:10:27.821]  And we see that every year that there's something like this on the books, more and more people get around to taking advantage of it.
[02:10:28.579 --> 02:10:37.488]  And, you know, the pity is that Americans have grown accustomed to thinking that we can't do something without the government telling us that we can do it.
[02:10:37.488 --> 02:10:48.159]  We think it's better to have a permit law than a prohibition, but we certainly think it's much better still to have something like Vermont or Alaska where no permit is needed.
[02:10:48.840 --> 02:10:51.422]  Yeah, and it's not like crime is out of control in Vermont.
[02:10:51.422 --> 02:10:55.105]  In fact, it's one of the nicest places that I visit up in the Northeast.
[02:10:55.105 --> 02:10:58.268]  When I get out of upstate New York, it's gorgeous, the people are great.
[02:10:58.268 --> 02:11:03.333]  You would never really know that, you know, people were carrying weapons, because it's just so second nature.
[02:11:03.333 --> 02:11:05.214]  There is no real violence there.
[02:11:05.214 --> 02:11:16.624]  I asked a police official one time, and they're state police, because it's an issue that comes up when you're talking to politicians and police officials, not necessarily rank and file,
[02:11:17.442 --> 02:11:24.085]  In other states, and especially when concealed carry, making it easier for concealed carry legislation comes up.
[02:11:24.085 --> 02:11:30.708]  I said, so how do you guys handle the fact that there's no computer database available to the state police when they pull somebody over?
[02:11:30.708 --> 02:11:33.329]  Otherwise, they're approaching a suspect.
[02:11:33.329 --> 02:11:39.672]  How do they handle not knowing whether or not the guy has a concealed carry permit since you don't have them?
[02:11:39.672 --> 02:11:44.954]  He said, well listen, any police officer, regardless of what his computer is telling him that
[02:11:45.598 --> 02:11:47.759]  The person he just pulled over, whatever.
[02:11:47.759 --> 02:11:54.440]  Oh, he has no concealed carry permit, therefore I can go up there chewing bubblegum and looking at the stars.
[02:11:54.440 --> 02:11:56.800]  You know, he's putting his life in his hands.
[02:11:56.800 --> 02:12:08.463]  And he better assume, he doesn't have to be a jerk about it, but he just better be on his guard that the guy could be armed, because the bad guy isn't going to be in the system anyway.
[02:12:09.079 --> 02:12:09.680]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:12:09.680 --> 02:12:15.185]  The guy that's actually going to pull a gun on you isn't going to be the guy that has the conceal and carry permit.
[02:12:15.185 --> 02:12:22.712]  He's going to be the guy that has warrants out for his arrest and knows it, and knows if he has an interaction with this cop more than five minutes, that he's going to jail.
[02:12:22.712 --> 02:12:28.537]  And that's when you see... I mean, I see him all the time when you're watching Spike TV and you're watching these confrontations.
[02:12:28.537 --> 02:12:30.079]  It's never a guy with an actual permit.
[02:12:30.079 --> 02:12:33.983]  It's the guys outside of the car, you know, waiting for the officer to move and then they shoot him.
[02:12:34.563 --> 02:12:58.710]  In fact, the one advantage that I can think of, and it's a temporary advantage, I would like to think, of having concealed carry permit holders is that when you do the research and you find out what the crime rate is among those folks versus the rest of the population that does not have them, the folks that are carrying concealed and have a permit to do so have about 90 to 95 percent less violent crime
[02:13:01.752 --> 02:13:04.333]  Then the rest of the population.
[02:13:04.333 --> 02:13:17.019]  So when we hear how much that we're putting people in danger to give everybody the opportunity to be carrying a gun, we should think the proper answer is, oh, well, good.
[02:13:17.019 --> 02:13:18.340]  Let's see if we can expand it.
[02:13:18.340 --> 02:13:27.724]  Because frankly, wouldn't lowering everybody's crime rate to 95% like the existing carry folks, wouldn't that be a worthwhile objective?
[02:13:28.596 --> 02:13:34.301]  You would think that, but the numbers are always fudged and the fear is always predicated in the media.
[02:13:34.301 --> 02:13:37.303]  Oh, these people with guns, they're dangerous.
[02:13:37.303 --> 02:13:45.189]  And they want to control us, and obviously control is a bit more problematic if everybody's armed, as George III.
[02:13:45.189 --> 02:13:47.752]  Wasn't that a bit of a difficulty?
[02:13:47.752 --> 02:13:51.755]  Absolutely, and that's why you see this attack on the Second Amendment.
[02:13:51.755 --> 02:13:52.515]  I'd like to get your
[02:13:53.760 --> 02:13:55.661]  Your views on this incoming administration?
[02:13:55.661 --> 02:14:00.985]  We're now a week away from the Obama administration being sworn in.
[02:14:00.985 --> 02:14:07.209]  Just telling me that there's only seven days until Obama is not a settling
[02:14:07.728 --> 02:14:09.149]  thing to think about.
[02:14:09.149 --> 02:14:16.091]  I know you're right, and it hasn't been exactly a bullet cherries under Bush, hardly, but Obama?
[02:14:16.091 --> 02:14:18.512]  Yeah, it's unsettling.
[02:14:18.512 --> 02:14:20.133]  And why is it so unsettling for you?
[02:14:20.133 --> 02:14:28.476]  I mean, now we, you know, obviously you have the people that went out and bought guns, there's record sales out there in ammunition, thinking that he's going to come after their gun rights, and I think that's
[02:14:29.196 --> 02:14:30.577]  A real fear.
[02:14:30.577 --> 02:14:38.423]  I can see him going to the people and asking for this, and then the media portraying it in such a way that we really don't have a choice.
[02:14:38.423 --> 02:14:41.365]  That's how many people are behind this Obama movement.
[02:14:41.365 --> 02:14:42.165]  Oh, yeah.
[02:14:42.165 --> 02:14:50.251]  Well, Obama's got a record as a state senator, especially, because he was there for a while, as a real gun banner.
[02:14:50.251 --> 02:14:55.014]  He doesn't think people should have guns unless they are working for the government.
[02:14:56.946 --> 02:15:03.611]  And if I had to choose between groups of the population, I would say everybody except those working for the government.
[02:15:03.611 --> 02:15:04.572]  After all, they work for us.
[02:15:04.572 --> 02:15:05.833]  They don't work for the government.
[02:15:05.833 --> 02:15:06.273]  That's the problem.
[02:15:06.273 --> 02:15:07.914]  They're supposed to be powered by the people, yeah.
[02:15:07.914 --> 02:15:08.535]  Yeah.
[02:15:08.535 --> 02:15:13.458]  So if we're going to be disarming people, which I'm not advocating, then it ought to be those that work for the government.
[02:15:13.458 --> 02:15:14.619]  Let's get this straight.
[02:15:14.619 --> 02:15:20.563]  They work for us, and they should do whatever it is we tell them, even if it's a bit goofy.
[02:15:20.563 --> 02:15:24.366]  And they can always not work for us if they don't like those terms.
[02:15:24.366 --> 02:15:25.267]  So we've got a guy that's
[02:15:25.962 --> 02:15:30.545]  Really anti-gun, and he's got a background that you just can't get away from.
[02:15:30.545 --> 02:15:36.308]  He's tried to do what so many politicians do, and sound like he's a man of the middle.
[02:15:36.308 --> 02:15:40.290]  I think he's simply playing the Hegelian dialectic.
[02:15:40.290 --> 02:15:46.053]  He votes one way, he talks another, and he makes you think, oh good, he's finally come to his senses.
[02:15:46.053 --> 02:15:49.775]  So your guard goes down, and wham, the synthesis is, gotcha.
[02:15:51.566 --> 02:16:06.497]  So, this guy has put in, for example, as a nominee for Attorney General, the fellow that was there at the Justice Department during the joyful events of Waco.
[02:16:06.497 --> 02:16:15.883]  He's the guy that went and tried to get the Puerto Rican terrorists to accept a pardon.
[02:16:15.883 --> 02:16:17.564]  They had not been seeking one.
[02:16:17.564 --> 02:16:18.265]  They thought it would
[02:16:19.207 --> 02:16:24.950]  Somehow stained the pristine nature of their just cause.
[02:16:24.950 --> 02:16:31.993]  You know, they'd only shot a few people in an invasion of Washington and the Congress.
[02:16:31.993 --> 02:16:35.535]  But, you know, that's a little stuff like that a long time ago.
[02:16:35.535 --> 02:16:41.177]  And so they actually deliberated whether or not to accept the pardon from Clinton.
[02:16:41.177 --> 02:16:46.660]  And this was something that Holder himself did, and it bypassed even the normal
[02:16:47.543 --> 02:16:50.565]  pardon office in the Clinton administration.
[02:16:50.565 --> 02:17:03.912]  So this guy is somebody who works around the law, works around established procedures, and he does it to benefit people who are convicted of murder and mayhem.
[02:17:03.912 --> 02:17:07.394]  Meanwhile, he would like to put average gun owners in jail.
[02:17:07.394 --> 02:17:16.899]  He signed on to the friend of the court brief, along with Janet Reno, that was opposing the overturn of the D.C.
[02:17:18.573 --> 02:17:32.363]  He was in favor of people not being able to protect themselves, and obviously there's a penalty in the district, and pretty much even now, yeah, you can have a handgun if you crawl over glass, stand on your head, and do a few other ridiculous things.
[02:17:32.363 --> 02:17:35.926]  You might be able to get your permit in the District of Columbia.
[02:17:35.926 --> 02:17:38.147]  Well, Holder thinks that's just fine.
[02:17:38.147 --> 02:17:39.709]  The more difficult, the better.
[02:17:39.709 --> 02:17:40.549]  Impossible?
[02:17:40.549 --> 02:17:41.870]  Better still.
[02:17:41.870 --> 02:17:43.852]  At least possible legally.
[02:17:43.852 --> 02:17:46.874]  Obviously the crooks got their guns quite readily.
[02:17:47.341 --> 02:17:48.862]  In the District of Columbia.
[02:17:48.862 --> 02:17:56.466]  But I really don't think that bothers these folks because they don't see crooks as a threat to them and to their system.
[02:17:56.466 --> 02:17:58.247]  I didn't say our government.
[02:17:58.247 --> 02:17:59.188]  Their system.
[02:17:59.188 --> 02:18:06.752]  They see crooks as people who are on the margin and not with any political agenda.
[02:18:06.752 --> 02:18:14.977]  They view people like Alex Jones, like Gun Owners of America, as having an agenda that's opposed to theirs.
[02:18:14.977 --> 02:18:16.498]  That's what bothers them.
[02:18:16.994 --> 02:18:18.675]  They want to control us.
[02:18:18.675 --> 02:18:23.096]  They don't care about controlling the criminals because they're largely irrelevant.
[02:18:23.096 --> 02:18:26.818]  But we're not, which I guess is somewhat of a compliment.
[02:18:26.818 --> 02:18:29.739]  They don't bother about things that are irrelevant.
[02:18:29.739 --> 02:18:30.939]  But this is Eric Holder.
[02:18:30.939 --> 02:18:35.161]  This is the first nomination out of the box, if you will.
[02:18:35.161 --> 02:18:40.923]  Unconstitutional as it may be, he still will be the nation's chief law enforcement official.
[02:18:41.759 --> 02:19:05.854]  And he will have at his control and at his discretion the bureaucrat levers of power that will enable him to do what Bush has been doing to manufacturers and owners and dealers and I suspect it'll even be more brazen, more harmful, more people in jail, more innocent people in jail than even now.
[02:19:07.228 --> 02:19:14.131]  This is going to be a very rough ride, and I don't see the Republicans holding.
[02:19:14.131 --> 02:19:34.299]  You have to have basically all 41 of them to make anything slow down in the Senate, and so far they haven't been doing very well at all in early votes on the Obama agenda, and you've got just enough that'll flake off that I think we're going to be in real trouble.
[02:19:35.262 --> 02:19:37.444]  Larry Pratt of Gun Owners of America.
[02:19:37.444 --> 02:19:41.949]  And when we come back, I want to talk about that District of Columbia Supreme Court ruling.
[02:19:41.949 --> 02:19:45.412]  Because in the media, it was championed as a win for gun owners.
[02:19:45.412 --> 02:19:47.934]  Oh, you can have guns in D.C.
[02:19:47.934 --> 02:19:49.976]  You only have to do all this to get it.
[02:19:49.976 --> 02:19:51.258]  See, it was all about regulation.
[02:19:51.258 --> 02:19:53.980]  Because like he said, the true criminals don't get permits.
[02:19:53.980 --> 02:19:55.021]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:19:55.021 --> 02:19:57.063]  Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:20:01.022 --> 02:20:02.323]  I am so frustrated.
[02:20:02.323 --> 02:20:04.665]  I can't seem to remember anything anymore.
[02:20:04.665 --> 02:20:05.245]  What?
[02:20:05.245 --> 02:20:08.007]  Seriously, my memory and attention span is terrible.
[02:20:08.007 --> 02:20:09.428]  I read something and forget.
[02:20:09.428 --> 02:20:10.689]  I forget people's names.
[02:20:10.689 --> 02:20:14.472]  I hear all this great information on the radio and I want to tell people, but I forget.
[02:20:14.472 --> 02:20:16.233]  I... Okay, slow down.
[02:20:16.233 --> 02:20:18.795]  Poor attention and memory loss is not your fault.
[02:20:18.795 --> 02:20:25.961]  Factors like fluoride in the water, aluminum in deodorants, genetically modified foods, the way the education system taught you.
[02:20:25.961 --> 02:20:27.562]  It's all meant to dumb you down.
[02:20:27.562 --> 02:20:29.303]  You know, I can remember everything now.
[02:20:29.303 --> 02:20:30.224]  Even entire books.
[02:20:30.464 --> 02:20:30.744]  What?
[02:20:30.744 --> 02:20:31.305]  How?
[02:20:31.305 --> 02:20:34.568]  There is this website called School of Phenomenal Memory.
[02:20:34.568 --> 02:20:38.331]  Their online course is a real breakthrough in the field of memory improvement.
[02:20:38.331 --> 02:20:47.981]  In fact, they guarantee that every single person will be able to memorize any type of information, including entire books after they complete just 60 lessons.
[02:20:47.981 --> 02:20:53.346]  And they offer a no-questions-asked, no-time-limit, money-back guarantee.
[02:20:53.346 --> 02:20:53.886]  Wow.
[02:20:53.886 --> 02:20:54.647]  What's the website?
[02:20:54.907 --> 02:20:58.371]  Now don't forget, it's pmemory.net.
[02:20:58.371 --> 02:21:00.313]  The letter P, memory dot net.
[02:21:10.495 --> 02:21:12.035]  But who is the enemy?
[02:21:12.035 --> 02:21:12.836]  Bin Laden.
[02:21:12.836 --> 02:21:13.816]  This is his M.O.
[02:21:13.816 --> 02:21:15.216]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:21:15.216 --> 02:21:17.197]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:21:17.197 --> 02:21:24.339]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:21:24.339 --> 02:21:24.819]  Some U.S.
[02:21:24.819 --> 02:21:30.501]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:21:31.181 --> 02:21:34.683]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:21:34.683 --> 02:21:37.484]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[02:22:01.112 --> 02:22:01.613]  Good day.
[02:22:01.613 --> 02:22:03.255]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[02:22:03.255 --> 02:22:03.715]  January 13, 2009.
[02:22:03.715 --> 02:22:04.817]  Gold opened this morning at $821.70.
[02:22:04.817 --> 02:22:07.701]  One ounce gold coin can be purchased for $846.29, $423.15 for a half ounce, and $211.57 for the quarter ounce.
[02:22:07.701 --> 02:22:08.301]  That's $846.29, $423.15, and $211.57.
[02:22:18.638 --> 02:22:20.820]  The dollar has fallen to 65% of the euro.
[02:22:20.820 --> 02:22:21.882]  Erosion accelerates.
[02:22:21.882 --> 02:22:28.929]  Mainline talk show hosts are trying to hold on to their support of the conservative movement, keeping focus on the Republican agenda and playing into the hand of the globalists.
[02:22:28.929 --> 02:22:32.293]  Dr. Corsi interviewed Robert Pastor of the American University.
[02:22:32.293 --> 02:22:38.480]  With the sleight of hand and incremental implementation, Pastor admits to the North American Union is being forced upon us.
[02:22:38.920 --> 02:22:43.601]  Corsi uncovers the CFR's plan to build a North American community similar to the EU.
[02:22:43.601 --> 02:22:48.623]  In his report, the North American Union isn't going away, Corsi exposes the deception and trickery.
[02:22:48.623 --> 02:22:49.963]  Call for your report today, 800-686-2237.
[02:22:49.963 --> 02:22:55.365]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.
[02:22:55.365 --> 02:22:55.665]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:55.665 --> 02:22:55.845]  That's 800-686-2237.

[02:23:53.786 --> 02:23:54.106]  That's 1-800-234-8654.
[02:23:54.106 --> 02:23:55.927]  They railed against the crowd, another ragtag band.
[02:24:18.894 --> 02:24:20.994]  Independence.
[02:24:20.994 --> 02:24:22.135]  What a novel word.
[02:24:22.135 --> 02:24:23.055]  Independence.
[02:24:23.055 --> 02:24:24.876]  You do things on your own.
[02:24:24.876 --> 02:24:25.676]  Free human being.
[02:24:25.676 --> 02:24:26.376]  Sovereign human being.
[02:24:26.376 --> 02:24:27.076]  Who knew?
[02:24:27.076 --> 02:24:31.078]  Before we go back to Larry Pratt of Gut Owners of America.
[02:24:32.523 --> 02:24:37.028]  I want to talk about one of our great sponsors out there, survivalistseeds.com.
[02:24:37.028 --> 02:24:39.010]  Really no gimmicks, folks.
[02:24:39.010 --> 02:24:40.651]  If you want food, grow it yourself.
[02:24:40.651 --> 02:24:43.975]  You can get some of the best seeds out there over at survivalistseeds.com.
[02:24:43.975 --> 02:24:54.045]  They help us pay the bills, and they help people have real food, and we're going to talk about that in about an hour or so when we have Jonas Stolzwitz and Maurice Thompson on.
[02:24:55.700 --> 02:25:06.870]  But you know, it's always nice to have the insurance policy and where I live in upstate New York, I've got like a small little garden and it's actually fun for me and my four-year-old niece to go out there and pick some tomatoes.
[02:25:06.870 --> 02:25:09.912]  She loves it and she picks the snap peas off the wire.
[02:25:09.912 --> 02:25:12.254]  It's fun and then we go have a nice good salad or dinner.
[02:25:13.015 --> 02:25:15.276]  It's good stuff, survivalofseeds.com.
[02:25:15.276 --> 02:25:29.400]  All right, let's go back to Larry Pratt of Gun Owners of America, and Larry, before you tell the listeners about this DC Supreme Court ruling that I believe it happened over the summer, why don't you tell people where they can get their information from you?
[02:25:29.400 --> 02:25:31.841]  Gunowners.org, best place to go.
[02:25:31.841 --> 02:25:34.142]  You could call us toll-free at 888-886-GUNS,
[02:25:41.476 --> 02:25:48.339]  But the place where you get direct access immediately to the information we've got is at GunOwners.org.
[02:25:48.339 --> 02:25:55.802]  You'll find, in fact, I think we still have it for today maybe, a commentary that I did on this D.C.
[02:25:55.802 --> 02:25:58.383]  court decision, the Heller case.
[02:25:58.383 --> 02:26:00.704]  It's right there on our main page.
[02:26:00.704 --> 02:26:07.087]  And we will shortly have up an email alert dealing with the Holder nomination, a very concerning one.
[02:26:07.087 --> 02:26:10.949]  And there will be an opportunity, if you go there, to GunOwners.org and
[02:26:11.403 --> 02:26:14.144]  Open that alert for Holder.
[02:26:14.144 --> 02:26:24.286]  You'll be able, or against him actually, you'll be able to send an email to the Senators telling them to put some backbone and oppose this guy.
[02:26:24.286 --> 02:26:25.406]  We're in a desperate fight.
[02:26:25.406 --> 02:26:40.849]  If he becomes the Attorney General, it's just one more sign that the Republicans are not going to be of any help, that they don't have it figured out yet that they have been so successively unsuccessful in the last elections.
[02:26:41.599 --> 02:26:55.084]  Several elections, really, because they have decided to become Democrat-lite, and, you know, the base doesn't want Democrat-real or Democrat-lite.
[02:26:55.084 --> 02:27:08.008]  They want something that's constitutional, that stands up and opposes these guys, and the Republicans are still not, by and large, I mean, there are exceptions, but most of them have not gotten the message.
[02:27:09.434 --> 02:27:11.379]  Yeah, I don't think they're going to get the message either.
[02:27:11.379 --> 02:27:14.647]  Well, they're not called a stupid party for nothing!
[02:27:16.311 --> 02:27:21.354]  Well, both parties at this point seem so amalgamated into one agenda.
[02:27:21.354 --> 02:27:26.517]  I mean, even the debates are just, you know, they're milk toast.
[02:27:26.517 --> 02:27:36.683]  It seems like they'll say, not only will they say one thing, but they'll lean towards somebody, but they don't actually take a real position saying, hey, this is what's going to happen when I'm in the presidency.
[02:27:36.683 --> 02:27:43.267]  It's, we'll see what we can do, and of course you have the right to own a gun, but then they don't tell you about all these regulations that are going to come with that.
[02:27:43.527 --> 02:27:50.349]  So why don't you discuss that DC, basically what you have to do to get a gun in DC now.
[02:27:50.349 --> 02:27:56.971]  Well, first of all, we can say that the Heller decision did one thing that was particularly helpful.
[02:27:56.971 --> 02:28:01.733]  It said that the Second Amendment does actually protect an individual right.
[02:28:01.733 --> 02:28:08.415]  Now, we knew that all along, the Constitution said that all along, but the importance of the Supreme Court
[02:28:09.096 --> 02:28:13.377]  saying that is that the lower courts have to deal with that.
[02:28:13.377 --> 02:28:26.161]  If they don't, that on its face becomes an appealable issue and makes it easier to get bad decisions at the lower federal court level brought to the Supreme Court.
[02:28:26.161 --> 02:28:38.805]  That's going to be important because there's a lot of things that the Heller decision did not touch on and it means that they're still up for grabs and there's going to be a lot of litigating between now and when the cows come home.
[02:28:39.592 --> 02:28:44.414]  The Heller decision said two things, which were really the only two things in front of the court.
[02:28:44.414 --> 02:28:54.718]  So in fairness, which is kind of hard for me to do, but in fairness to the court, that's what they should have done was to just simply rule on those two things.
[02:28:54.718 --> 02:28:57.259]  And they came to the right conclusion on both.
[02:28:57.259 --> 02:29:08.023]  It's unconstitutional to ban handguns, and it is unconstitutional to require the encumbrance on other allowable guns
[02:29:08.678 --> 02:29:09.739]  Yeah, it just seems so...
[02:29:27.125 --> 02:29:33.168]  It's ridiculous that I'm supposed to keep my gun in a safe if there's something going on in my house and I need my gun.
[02:29:33.168 --> 02:29:37.791]  I mean, I might have to reach for it in a time I don't have time to punch in a code.
[02:29:37.791 --> 02:29:38.351]  Who knew?
[02:29:38.351 --> 02:29:39.592]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:29:39.592 --> 02:29:40.872]  I'm Jason Bermas with Larry Pratt.
[02:29:40.872 --> 02:29:41.853]  We'll be back after this.
[02:29:41.853 --> 02:29:42.873]  Infowars.com.
[02:29:42.873 --> 02:29:51.758]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:29:51.758 --> 02:29:53.159]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.159 --> 02:29:54.680]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.663 --> 02:30:02.247]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.247 --> 02:30:03.028]  Attention.
[02:30:03.028 --> 02:30:06.070]  This is an extremely urgent self-reliant news bulletin.
[02:30:06.070 --> 02:30:13.154]  If you have ever wanted to produce your own cheaper-than-dirt survival food, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:30:13.154 --> 02:30:13.795]  Here is why.
[02:30:14.614 --> 02:30:25.080]  This network has just learned of a new video course that reveals the secrets of how to safely prepare and store all types of survival foods in an event of social unrest and food shortages here in the U.S.
[02:30:25.080 --> 02:30:27.802]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[02:30:27.802 --> 02:30:29.923]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[02:30:29.923 --> 02:30:30.904]  this fall?
[02:30:30.904 --> 02:30:31.904]  Don't wait!

[02:30:56.415 --> 02:30:56.755]  Act now!
[02:31:01.537 --> 02:31:03.700]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[02:31:03.700 --> 02:31:06.123]  I've come with a message of information.
[02:31:06.123 --> 02:31:08.747]  9-11 was an inside job.
[02:31:08.747 --> 02:31:09.948]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[02:31:09.948 --> 02:31:11.651]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[02:31:11.651 --> 02:31:14.554]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[02:31:14.554 --> 02:31:18.199]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[02:31:27.852 --> 02:31:32.714]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[02:31:36.503 --> 02:31:38.924]  How dare you?
[02:31:38.924 --> 02:31:44.006]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[02:31:44.006 --> 02:31:46.908]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[02:31:46.908 --> 02:31:53.370]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[02:31:53.370 --> 02:31:56.192]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.TV right now.
[02:31:56.192 --> 02:31:58.473]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[02:31:58.473 --> 02:32:02.695]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[02:32:02.695 --> 02:32:03.655]  Hello, I'm Steve Shane.
[02:32:04.451 --> 02:32:08.274]  Many have been afraid they needed their food supplies before the election.
[02:32:08.274 --> 02:32:15.499]  The inauguration, not the election, is the deadline given by the Obama insiders for completing your food supplies.
[02:32:15.499 --> 02:32:28.289]  Joe Biden and Colin Powell both stated that shortly after the inauguration, possibly the 21st or 22nd of January, the new president would be forced by an international incident to make some unpopular decisions.
[02:32:28.289 --> 02:32:32.172]  This functions as an important deadline for getting any food you intend to have.
[02:32:32.796 --> 02:32:40.843]  The unpopular presidential decisions will likely affect restriction of transportation and availability of food distribution.
[02:32:40.843 --> 02:32:46.468]  Order any remaining food needed no later than four weeks before the inauguration to allow for shipping.
[02:32:46.468 --> 02:32:51.012]  Late orders cannot be guaranteed delivery by this deadline for disaster.
[02:32:51.012 --> 02:32:52.393]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com 800-409-5633
[02:33:05.462 --> 02:33:08.565]  Alright folks, it's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:08.565 --> 02:33:12.188]  I am Jason Burmas, sitting in for the week.
[02:33:29.039 --> 02:33:37.264]  And, uh, you know, I hope you go to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv and get a hard copy of Fabled Enemies and make ten copies and hand them out.
[02:33:37.264 --> 02:33:43.687]  Or get a hard copy of Alex Jones' Endgame and get ten copies and hand them out.
[02:33:43.687 --> 02:33:46.169]  You know, hold a screening, get the information out there.
[02:33:47.262 --> 02:33:54.468]  Because it's through human communication that we're able to relay these ideas and people actually do start to think for themselves.
[02:33:54.468 --> 02:33:56.249]  They do question things.
[02:33:56.249 --> 02:34:02.995]  And that's what we need now more than ever when we have a president coming into office that expects sacrifice and service.
[02:34:02.995 --> 02:34:13.223]  When you have Rahm Emanuel coming in saying that he is for mandatory conscription of 18 to 25 year olds and now you have this new book being published called Grits.
[02:34:13.223 --> 02:34:14.865]  This guy's been on the trail now for
[02:34:15.365 --> 02:34:17.086]  Two plus years talking about conscription.
[02:34:17.086 --> 02:34:19.388]  Tom Blankley out of the Washington Times.
[02:34:19.388 --> 02:34:22.150]  And it's all about programming you to be for it.
[02:34:22.150 --> 02:34:24.171]  And I'm worried about it.
[02:34:24.171 --> 02:34:25.972]  A lot of people are behind Obama.
[02:34:25.972 --> 02:34:35.038]  And like I said, especially when I'm in New York and I'm going through the mall and I just see shirt after shirt and hat after hat of Obama or Yes We Can.
[02:34:35.038 --> 02:34:36.579]  And these aren't election shirts.
[02:34:36.579 --> 02:34:43.184]  These are like fashionable, like hip hop style jackets, shirts like $35 hats.
[02:34:43.184 --> 02:34:44.805]  You know, the culture is being brainwashed.
[02:34:45.585 --> 02:34:50.266]  Alright, let's go back to Larry Pratt of Gun Owners of America.
[02:34:50.266 --> 02:34:52.526]  Larry, why don't you tell people how they can get this information?
[02:34:52.526 --> 02:34:53.767]  What's the website and the number?
[02:34:53.767 --> 02:35:01.548]  And then I'd like you to tell me, why is it so hard for a New Yorker to get a carry and conceal permit as opposed to these other states?
[02:35:01.548 --> 02:35:11.210]  I mean, I've often wondered why it is that my buddy who was in the National Guard couldn't get a carry and conceal permit once he got back from Iraq.
[02:35:11.210 --> 02:35:14.291]  Well, GunOwners.org is where you're going to find the
[02:35:14.966 --> 02:35:29.171]  information about what we're up to at the federal level, the congressional lobbying that we're doing, particularly to draw people's attention to the alerts that we keep a log of the current ones right there on the homepage.
[02:35:29.171 --> 02:35:41.416]  So when you go to gunowners.org, you'll be able to see the things that we're working on, the things of concern and what people can do about it with a few easy clicks, sending off email to their senators, their representatives.
[02:35:41.889 --> 02:35:45.451]  Whatever is the appropriate recipient here in Washington.
[02:35:45.451 --> 02:35:54.056]  In New York, you had something that went on the books relatively early in this country, a Sullivan Act.
[02:35:54.056 --> 02:35:56.857]  In my mind, it has a rather ironic history.
[02:35:56.857 --> 02:36:04.722]  The name Sullivan might suggest correctly that the namesake is Irish.
[02:36:04.722 --> 02:36:10.085]  It was an Irish state senator, Sullivan, who was importuned by some of his criminal
[02:36:10.632 --> 02:36:29.281]  Constituents, the Irish Mafia, as it were, that they didn't like the influx of these Italian Mafia coming in from Southern Europe, and they were basically hitting on the turf of the fellows that were already there, and they didn't like it.
[02:36:29.281 --> 02:36:39.146]  And so they, in the name of crime control, the constant handmaiden of these scalawag politicians,
[02:36:39.554 --> 02:36:50.637]  In the name of crime control, they enacted the Sullivan Act, targeting, basically, even though the language was general, targeting these Italian mafia that needed to be controlled.
[02:36:50.637 --> 02:36:53.058]  Well, it shows that even crooks can be stupid.
[02:36:53.058 --> 02:37:02.120]  Here they are, willing to break the law, six waves from Sunday, and they assume that a gun control law is going to disarm their opponents.
[02:37:02.120 --> 02:37:08.262]  But when the politicians worded it, naturally they worded it as a general matter so that persons and
[02:37:08.717 --> 02:37:09.558]  We're good to go.
[02:37:37.585 --> 02:37:37.725]  I think?
[02:38:00.800 --> 02:38:11.344]  Oh, right before an election that he was running for Senate, you might say, that he wasn't a person of good enough character to be able to get a concealed carry permit.
[02:38:11.344 --> 02:38:18.947]  Well, after that fiasco, we got then State Senator Virgil Goode, who later went on to serve with distinction in the U.S.
[02:38:18.947 --> 02:38:26.390]  House of Representatives, to change the concealed carry law so that discretion was taken away from these judges.
[02:38:26.390 --> 02:38:30.051]  That's something that needs to be done and would help enormously in New York.
[02:38:30.549 --> 02:38:38.957]  If you just made it into the kind of law you have in Virginia, it wouldn't be quite as good for other reasons, but it would help enormously.
[02:38:38.957 --> 02:38:45.924]  If you go in, you make your application, they can't prove that you're a crook or, you know, some other disqualified person.
[02:38:45.924 --> 02:38:48.386]  They gotta give you the permit.
[02:38:48.386 --> 02:38:53.671]  And that's what we did to take it away from the judges in Virginia.
[02:38:53.671 --> 02:38:55.213]  We've just never been able to do that.
[02:38:55.988 --> 02:38:57.589]  In New York.
[02:38:57.589 --> 02:38:59.210]  Yeah, New York's a tough one.
[02:38:59.210 --> 02:39:08.414]  Larry, in the next 90 seconds, why don't you tell gun owners out there, people who are pro-Second Amendment, what they can do today to help ensure their gun rights for the future?
[02:39:08.414 --> 02:39:12.956]  Well, I think it's important that the people not stop speaking out.
[02:39:12.956 --> 02:39:24.241]  If the politicians think we've gone away, they're going to just be all the more unaccountable and unconcerned about the opinion of folks back home.
[02:39:24.241 --> 02:39:24.742]  There's been
[02:39:26.629 --> 02:39:46.384]  A reluctance so far on the part of Democrats, in particular, to initiate anti-gun legislation unless they can get the NRA to support it, thus baptizing it, making it respectable, not even really gun control as long as it has that kind of across the spectrum support.
[02:39:46.384 --> 02:39:49.547]  And we've got to make enough noise that no matter what the NRA does,
[02:39:50.286 --> 02:39:50.626]  I think?
[02:40:10.478 --> 02:40:22.201]  Folks at home, as much as the Democrats, because the Republicans have never figured out that if it hurts their opponents, then it would benefit Republicans to make their opponents vote on it.
[02:40:22.201 --> 02:40:31.263]  That's something that is going to be harder in this Congress because the rules are not favorable and they're not changing them in our favor.
[02:40:31.263 --> 02:40:38.745]  But nevertheless, the Republicans need to hear from folks who don't agree with what they're, I mean, Orrin Hatch right now.
[02:40:39.329 --> 02:40:47.571]  is the guy that's selling out the cause on trying to fight Eric Holder's nomination as Attorney General.
[02:40:47.571 --> 02:41:04.274]  Orrin Hatch has already broken ranks with the small Republican caucus, and if we don't have his vote, we won't be able to, unless we can get a Democrat from somewhere, mount an opposition to Eric Holder through a filibuster threat.
[02:41:04.274 --> 02:41:08.175]  Thank you very much, Orrin Hatch, the, quote, conservative from Utah.
[02:41:09.676 --> 02:41:12.378]  Well, Larry, it's politics as usual in my mind.
[02:41:12.378 --> 02:41:13.999]  They say one thing and they do another.
[02:41:13.999 --> 02:41:15.300]  I thank you so much for joining us.
[02:41:15.300 --> 02:41:19.663]  It's Gun Owners of America, and I want to shift gears right now.
[02:41:19.663 --> 02:41:25.226]  We only got a couple seconds in between, but I want to play this Metallica video.
[02:41:25.226 --> 02:41:27.228]  I think it's important for people to see.
[02:41:27.228 --> 02:41:34.873]  It brings up a lot of the things that we talk about from eugenics to chemtrails to, you know, the light that is not light is here.
[02:41:34.873 --> 02:41:35.813]  All right, let's play the video.
[02:41:35.813 --> 02:41:38.835]  PrisonPlanet.tv is where to watch this, folks, if you're a subscriber.
[02:41:38.835 --> 02:41:39.476]  All right, hit it.
[02:41:53.659 --> 02:41:57.680]  Of course, technical difficulty for some reason.
[02:41:57.680 --> 02:42:01.701]  Do we not have this loaded up?
[02:42:01.701 --> 02:42:06.181]  I could have swore that we had it loaded up.
[02:42:06.181 --> 02:42:08.622]  Of course, of course it's not going to work, right?
[02:42:14.602 --> 02:42:17.644]  Well, folks, I really, really want to play this for you.
[02:42:17.644 --> 02:42:19.325]  I don't know why it's not playing.
[02:42:19.325 --> 02:42:23.046]  Maybe we can refresh the page and hopefully it'll come up.
[02:42:23.046 --> 02:42:27.049]  But really, again, I mean, it's got a lot of interesting things in it.
[02:42:27.049 --> 02:42:31.591]  And, you know, for them at the end to play actual news clips of... Here we go.
[02:42:31.591 --> 02:42:32.632]  There we go.
[02:42:32.632 --> 02:42:33.352]  Boom.
[02:42:33.352 --> 02:42:37.354]  Alright, let's get the volume on it.
[02:42:37.354 --> 02:42:38.214]  Do we have the volume on it?
[02:44:27.559 --> 02:44:33.284]  Luck runs out.
[02:44:33.284 --> 02:44:36.106]  Call from the wreckage one more time.
[02:44:36.106 --> 02:44:38.849]  Horrific memory, twist the mind.
[02:44:38.849 --> 02:44:41.431]  Dark, rutted, cold and hard to turn.
[02:44:41.431 --> 02:44:44.333]  Path of destruction, feel it burn.
[02:44:44.333 --> 02:44:47.136]  Still life, incarnation.
[02:44:47.136 --> 02:44:50.839]  Still life, infamy.
[02:44:50.839 --> 02:44:52.540]  Hallucination, heresy.
[02:44:52.540 --> 02:44:53.301]  Still you run.
[02:45:39.707 --> 02:45:57.434]  But your luck runs out!
[02:46:04.309 --> 02:46:08.991]  Rock runs out.
[02:46:08.991 --> 02:46:14.332]  The light that is not light is here to crush you out with your own fear.
[02:46:14.332 --> 02:46:17.413]  You hide, you hide, the will be found.
[02:46:17.413 --> 02:46:22.854]  Release your grip without a sound.
[02:46:22.854 --> 02:46:26.015]  Still life, immolation.
[02:46:26.015 --> 02:46:26.815]  Still life, infamy.
[02:46:26.815 --> 02:46:28.236]  Hallucination, heresy.
[02:46:28.236 --> 02:46:29.596]  Still you run wild.
[02:46:50.740 --> 02:47:06.118]  Yes, every move we trace Hunt you down without mercy Hunt you down all night very long, yeah Luck runs I can crawl out again But your luck runs out
[02:48:30.316 --> 02:48:30.558]  Yeah!
[02:49:28.871 --> 02:49:35.210]  This is your confession!
[02:49:57.517 --> 02:49:59.143]  Yeah.
[02:50:45.430 --> 02:50:49.455]  Alright folks, we're going to be back after this with the Chemtrail News portion of that.
[02:50:49.455 --> 02:50:51.357]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:51:02.088 --> 02:51:04.751]  Break the law and you're caught on film.
[02:51:04.751 --> 02:51:09.775]  Practically impossible for police to spot plates that have been treated with a reflective spray.
[02:51:09.775 --> 02:51:11.737]  The reflection blinded our camera.
[02:51:11.737 --> 02:51:13.058]  We are under the microscope.
[02:51:13.058 --> 02:51:17.082]  Red light cameras and speed cameras are in place to make money, not for your safety.

[02:52:01.352 --> 02:52:08.117]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:52:08.117 --> 02:52:09.779]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:52:10.754 --> 02:52:12.296]  But who is the enemy?
[02:52:12.296 --> 02:52:13.097]  Bin Laden.
[02:52:13.097 --> 02:52:14.098]  This is his M.O.
[02:52:14.098 --> 02:52:15.460]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:52:15.460 --> 02:52:17.462]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:52:17.462 --> 02:52:24.610]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:52:24.610 --> 02:52:25.091]  Some U.S.
[02:52:25.091 --> 02:52:30.758]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:52:31.438 --> 02:52:34.921]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:52:34.921 --> 02:52:37.742]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[02:53:01.152 --> 02:53:01.552]  I think so.
[02:53:20.145 --> 02:53:20.545]  I think so.
[02:53:49.628 --> 02:53:52.851]  Why does our government not allow this crop to grow in the US?
[02:53:52.851 --> 02:53:55.373]  This product is also great for pets and animals.
[02:53:55.373 --> 02:53:57.315]  Call 908-691-2608 or go to hempusa.org today!
[02:53:57.315 --> 02:54:01.459]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now!
[02:54:01.459 --> 02:54:03.681]  No matter how hard you try,
[02:54:12.852 --> 02:54:19.615]  From one killer band to the next, Metallica Rage Against the Machine, The Info War continues, folks.
[02:54:19.615 --> 02:54:21.156]  And why did we just play that Metallica video?
[02:54:21.156 --> 02:54:35.303]  Well, we're going to play the very, very end of that horror show, but if you saw it at the very end, you're on PrisonPlan.TV, you saw them put up the chemtrails, and the chemtrails is what killed the larger part of the zombie population, because it had chromium and barium in it.
[02:54:35.303 --> 02:54:38.885]  But now, at the very end, they're going to play actual news reports.
[02:54:38.885 --> 02:54:39.125]  Listen.
[02:54:43.677 --> 02:54:44.297]  Bring it back, guys.
[02:55:08.530 --> 02:55:10.692]  Proving the source is a whole nother matter.
[02:55:10.692 --> 02:55:13.615]  Well, who else would be able to have planes in U.S.
[02:55:13.615 --> 02:55:17.038]  airspace other than the United States government spraying chemicals?
[02:55:17.038 --> 02:55:24.606]  And again, they spin it as to the arsenic and the barium in there are basically to thwart a Russian plot to zombify America.
[02:55:25.446 --> 02:55:26.687]  I don't care for that spin.
[02:55:26.687 --> 02:55:37.193]  I don't like that spin, but there's a there's a really crazy music video from the Tunguska event to Russian Eugenics to Chemtrails all being intertwined.
[02:55:37.193 --> 02:55:39.095]  I encourage people to check that out.
[02:55:39.095 --> 02:55:40.275]  We got a few minutes for calls.
[02:55:40.275 --> 02:55:43.757]  I know a lot of people have been holding and then we're going to go to Jonas Stolzfitz in the
[02:55:44.978 --> 02:55:47.180]  Yeah, how are you doing?
[02:55:47.180 --> 02:55:55.007]  I was actually calling for a question for Larry.
[02:55:55.007 --> 02:56:01.352]  I don't know if he's still on.
[02:56:01.352 --> 02:56:03.594]  Uh, he's not, but maybe the next time we get him.
[02:56:03.594 --> 02:56:04.535]  What was your question for him?
[02:56:04.535 --> 02:56:12.322]  Well, the question was actually, I wanted to know his opinion of Appleseed Rifle Clinics, and because the gun culture is so divided, I was going to ask
[02:56:13.061 --> 02:56:19.423]  If they're doing any cross-pollinating with other organizations, such as Appleseed or any others, try to come up with a unified front.
[02:56:19.423 --> 02:56:21.084]  Well, I would throw him an email.
[02:56:21.084 --> 02:56:26.206]  I'm not quite sure I know Alex plans on having him on again when he gets back, so hopefully we can answer that question then.
[02:56:26.206 --> 02:56:28.567]  Let's jump to Robert in Texas.
[02:56:28.567 --> 02:56:30.367]  Robert, what's on your mind?
[02:56:30.367 --> 02:56:31.228]  Jason.
[02:56:31.228 --> 02:56:31.888]  Yes.
[02:56:31.888 --> 02:56:33.369]  Great to talk to you.
[02:56:33.369 --> 02:56:34.269]  First time caller.
[02:56:34.269 --> 02:56:36.150]  Cool.
[02:56:36.150 --> 02:56:41.192]  I called with a question for Mr. Pratt, but I'll just go ahead and put the issue out there.
[02:56:43.325 --> 02:57:03.424]  Fifteen years ago, here in Texas, I was felonized for a DWI, and according to the Penal Code of the State of Texas, five years after I have done my time, whether it was in prison or completed parole, I'm allowed to own firearms again.
[02:57:03.424 --> 02:57:08.508]  But, of course, federal law says that for the rest of my life, I am to be defenseless.
[02:57:10.310 --> 02:57:23.841]  So, what I was going to ask Mr. Pratt, and I guess what he's put out there is, I wonder if there's any organization out there at this time, as far as a Second Amendment organization, who is pursuing that legally.
[02:57:23.841 --> 02:57:36.070]  Because, you know, with the Heller decision, and I know they threw the felon thing in there, but they said that the Second Amendment was a God-given right, the same as freedom of religion or freedom of expression.
[02:57:36.070 --> 02:57:39.112]  So, you know, if that's the case, how can they take it away from me?
[02:57:39.997 --> 02:57:41.138]  That's a great question.
[02:57:41.138 --> 02:57:41.759]  You know what?
[02:57:41.759 --> 02:57:43.941]  I would say go to Gun Owners of America.
[02:57:43.941 --> 02:57:45.282]  Send them an email.
[02:57:45.282 --> 02:57:51.267]  Larry Pratt is a lot more prevalent than me with his gun owner knowledge.
[02:57:51.267 --> 02:57:54.570]  Being a Second Amendment advocate, that's about all I know.
[02:57:54.570 --> 02:57:55.831]  I don't really handle a gun.
[02:57:55.831 --> 02:58:00.015]  I got a .22 in my house that's my roommate's and he's a hunter.
[02:58:00.015 --> 02:58:01.776]  That's why we have that there.
[02:58:01.776 --> 02:58:03.218]  It's deer season not so long ago.
[02:58:05.206 --> 02:58:06.247]  I wish I knew a little bit more.
[02:58:06.247 --> 02:58:09.149]  Alright, let's go to Brandon in Canada.
[02:58:09.149 --> 02:58:11.250]  Brandon, what's on your mind?
[02:58:11.250 --> 02:58:12.491]  How you doing, Jason?
[02:58:12.491 --> 02:58:13.432]  Good.
[02:58:13.432 --> 02:58:14.032]  Quickly, Brandon.
[02:58:14.032 --> 02:58:14.973]  I've got about 30 seconds.
[02:58:16.603 --> 02:58:18.384]  Okay, you want to put me back on hold then?
[02:58:18.384 --> 02:58:19.245]  I can't.
[02:58:19.245 --> 02:58:19.725]  You know what?
[02:58:19.725 --> 02:58:20.445]  I will put you on hold.
[02:58:20.445 --> 02:58:22.307]  We'll take your call at the top of the hour.
[02:58:22.307 --> 02:58:25.669]  Then we'll go to Jonas Stoltzfitz and Maurice Thompson.
[02:58:25.669 --> 02:58:30.453]  That's right, they're SWAT teaming people who are trying to sell you healthy milk.
[02:58:30.453 --> 02:58:31.033]  Imagine that.
[02:58:31.033 --> 02:58:34.896]  We're just going to take it, put it under government control, cut out the small farmer.
[02:58:34.896 --> 02:58:42.922]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:58:42.922 --> 02:58:44.703]  You are listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.474 --> 02:58:51.438]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[02:58:51.438 --> 02:58:52.078]  Hello, friends.
[02:58:52.078 --> 02:58:53.139]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:58:53.139 --> 02:58:57.883]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:58:57.883 --> 02:59:00.845]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:59:00.845 --> 02:59:03.887]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:59:03.887 --> 02:59:09.732]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[02:59:09.952 --> 02:59:13.196]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:59:13.196 --> 02:59:20.185]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[02:59:20.185 --> 02:59:23.469]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[02:59:23.469 --> 02:59:23.729]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:26.052 --> 02:59:26.292]  Today.
[02:59:54.156 --> 02:59:56.539]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.539 --> 02:59:59.323]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:14.716 --> 03:00:17.557]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, we are back!
[03:00:17.557 --> 03:00:21.138]  And we'll be going to Jonas Stolzfus in a moment.
[03:00:21.138 --> 03:00:28.080]  Back in May, the Feds launched a, this is out for WorldNetDaily by the way, Gestapo raid over raw milk.
[03:00:28.080 --> 03:00:34.222]  They went in and took $30,000 worth of milk, cheese, and other, and butter.
[03:00:34.222 --> 03:00:37.223]  I mean, basically they took this guy's farm away from him.
[03:00:37.223 --> 03:00:41.245]  They took his product away, they took his way of life away.
[03:00:41.245 --> 03:00:42.245]  And since then,
[03:00:43.729 --> 03:00:52.334]  Jonas and Judy Stoltzfitz have started the Pennsylvania Independent Consumer and Farmers Association in a direct response to that.
[03:00:52.334 --> 03:00:53.835]  It's just a crazy undercover sting.
[03:00:53.835 --> 03:00:54.995]  We'll get to him in one moment.
[03:00:54.995 --> 03:00:56.756]  Brandon, you called in.
[03:00:56.756 --> 03:00:58.197]  What do you want to talk about?
[03:00:58.197 --> 03:01:04.721]  Well, I just want to know, what is the majority of Americans going to do when the Constitution is put on hold?
[03:01:04.721 --> 03:01:09.563]  I know up here in Canada, our moron of a Prime Minister just corrolled Parliament to the 26th of January.
[03:01:11.465 --> 03:01:13.126]  Basically, he's got veto power.
[03:01:13.126 --> 03:01:16.568]  He can do whatever he wants between now and then, sign any agreements.
[03:01:16.568 --> 03:01:21.150]  And it wouldn't be, you know, privy to the people because Parliament's not in session.
[03:01:21.150 --> 03:01:24.872]  So I just want to know, when the massive crisis happens, what's the majority of the people going to do?
[03:01:24.872 --> 03:01:27.834]  Are they going to stand up and fight when these government terrorists come kick in your door?
[03:01:28.716 --> 03:01:29.816]  Or what?
[03:01:29.816 --> 03:01:30.577]  I don't know.
[03:01:30.577 --> 03:01:33.777]  I mean, I expect a lot of them to lay down, to be honest with you, Brandon.
[03:01:33.777 --> 03:01:35.938]  Have you seen that guy, JJ Johnson?
[03:01:35.938 --> 03:01:38.779]  He was on C-SPAN.
[03:01:38.779 --> 03:01:40.239]  He was from Ohio.
[03:01:40.239 --> 03:01:44.180]  They kept calling him a Nazi because he was a black man and he was, like, stainless.
[03:01:44.180 --> 03:01:52.482]  And we're starting to build, like, not compounds, but the people in the communities are, like, arming themselves to protect themselves because they have rights.
[03:01:53.229 --> 03:01:54.790]  And they're not going to lie down and die for this.
[03:02:11.161 --> 03:02:30.419]  uh... you know the public mindset against the second amendment against malicious against uh... you know communes and you know they made david correction by the way i'm no crash fan into you know hit him being a religious not into an excuse to kill a bunch of women and children so you know i i don't expect much of an opposition from the american people i thank you for the call
[03:02:30.919 --> 03:02:34.041]  Alright, with that said, we have Jonas Stolzfus on the line.
[03:02:34.041 --> 03:02:35.422]  I hope I'm pronouncing that right.
[03:02:35.422 --> 03:02:39.285]  Out of the Pennsylvania Independent Consumers and Farmers Association.
[03:02:39.285 --> 03:02:44.329]  And they started this group, you know, really right after this raid in May.
[03:02:44.329 --> 03:02:47.752]  Why don't you just give us some background on this raid, Jonas?
[03:02:47.752 --> 03:02:49.033]  Well, some background.
[03:02:49.033 --> 03:02:52.695]  Actually, Alex, there were three raids altogether.
[03:02:52.695 --> 03:02:55.938]  One happened, give or take August.
[03:02:57.280 --> 03:03:00.784]  Uh, $20,000 or so of stuff and equipment was taken.
[03:03:00.784 --> 03:03:08.050]  Another, uh, the next spring, again, about $20,000, $25,000 worth of stuff was taken.
[03:03:08.050 --> 03:03:23.224]  And the third one then, after an undercover agent by the name of Kirk, that's K-I-R-K from the Carlisle State Police Barracks, went into Mark Knopf's farm and, uh, went in with an old beat-up pickup truck.
[03:03:24.598 --> 03:03:42.248]  And the parents weren't home, and so he talked to the children, a young man, and used my name, saying that, he said, I'm new in the area, and Jonas and Judy said that this would be a good place for me to buy raw milk.
[03:03:42.248 --> 03:03:51.574]  Now, there was a witness to this whole thing, and he settled for two gallons of raw milk after giving his sob story about being new in the area and knowing me.
[03:03:53.316 --> 03:03:59.018]  And when he left the site, he said, uh, say hello to Jonas for me.
[03:03:59.018 --> 03:04:02.979]  And promptly took the milk to the PDA.
[03:04:02.979 --> 03:04:06.040]  They confirmed, yes, it was raw milk.
[03:04:06.040 --> 03:04:11.022]  And they promptly, within a very few days, came and raided him again.
[03:04:11.022 --> 03:04:14.603]  This time they got $10,000 worth of stuff from him.
[03:04:14.603 --> 03:04:21.225]  So we have an ongoing case of harassment and persecution
[03:04:22.108 --> 03:04:23.069]  I don't think so.
[03:04:37.000 --> 03:04:43.362]  He can make a living, but the state thinks that he has to have permission.
[03:04:43.362 --> 03:04:48.764]  The state wants to regulate not only what we do in our lives, but what we put in our bodies.
[03:04:48.764 --> 03:04:50.105]  And that's what this is all about.
[03:04:50.105 --> 03:04:51.005]  We'll be back after this.
[03:04:51.005 --> 03:04:51.985]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:04:51.985 --> 03:04:53.546]  I am Jason Bermas, InfoWars.com.
[03:05:01.761 --> 03:05:05.465]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[03:05:05.465 --> 03:05:11.211]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[03:05:11.211 --> 03:05:15.536]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[03:05:15.536 --> 03:05:17.999]  Nature's gem, premium omega-3.
[03:05:17.999 --> 03:05:23.925]  Unlike other flaxseed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing cooler temperatures.
[03:05:24.065 --> 03:05:24.805]  We're good to go!
[03:05:53.240 --> 03:05:57.484]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:05:57.484 --> 03:05:58.585]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[03:06:11.412 --> 03:06:12.772]  Who is the enemy?
[03:06:12.772 --> 03:06:13.573]  Bin Laden.
[03:06:13.573 --> 03:06:14.553]  This is his M.O.s.
[03:06:14.553 --> 03:06:15.853]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:06:15.853 --> 03:06:17.934]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[03:06:17.934 --> 03:06:25.076]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[03:06:25.076 --> 03:06:25.556]  Some U.S.
[03:06:25.556 --> 03:06:31.198]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:06:31.898 --> 03:06:35.419]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:06:35.419 --> 03:06:38.199]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[03:07:01.892 --> 03:07:05.315]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[03:07:05.315 --> 03:07:09.578]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[03:07:09.578 --> 03:07:17.545]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water
[03:07:17.825 --> 03:07:18.205]  We're good to go!
[03:07:50.775 --> 03:07:52.596]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:13.072 --> 03:08:14.415]  Alright folks, we are back.
[03:08:14.415 --> 03:08:15.438]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:15.438 --> 03:08:20.449]  I am Jason Vermas, filmmaker of Loose Change and Fabled Enemies, sitting in.
[03:08:20.449 --> 03:08:22.274]  Before we go back to Jonas Stolzfus.
[03:08:23.379 --> 03:08:27.280]  Look, I gotta give another disclaimer, I guess, for this Metallica video I just played.
[03:08:27.280 --> 03:08:33.302]  You know, I played it for the PrisonPlanet.tv audience because it covers eugenics, it covers chemtrails.
[03:08:33.302 --> 03:08:41.905]  Um, you know, for a platinum-selling artist to cover these issues and to play actual news clips at the end of their music video is newsworthy.
[03:08:41.905 --> 03:08:46.506]  So all you listeners out there that think this has turned into some kind of hard rock metal show, it hasn't.
[03:08:46.506 --> 03:08:48.687]  We played one song in four hours.
[03:08:48.687 --> 03:08:50.408]  I apologize to anybody we offended.
[03:08:51.542 --> 03:08:53.864]  Alright, let's get on to bigger and better topics.
[03:08:53.864 --> 03:09:01.209]  The fact that the federal government is trying to regulate what we can eat and put into our bodies, and they're going after all these organic farmers.
[03:09:01.209 --> 03:09:08.474]  They want us to eat these GMO foods that are full of poison, and they want to put the small-time farmer out of business in general.
[03:09:08.474 --> 03:09:15.879]  If they can't control them with their surplus farming and having them destroy their corn crop, then they have no use for them, and that's why we've seen
[03:09:16.559 --> 03:09:20.040]  Just really a demise in this country of the family farm.
[03:09:20.040 --> 03:09:24.681]  I live in upstate New York and more and more people every month have to give up their family farm.
[03:09:24.681 --> 03:09:26.722]  It's pretty crazy to me, Jonas.
[03:09:26.722 --> 03:09:28.102]  It's really bad.
[03:09:28.102 --> 03:09:30.323]  Did you know about the Sharon Palmer case?
[03:09:30.323 --> 03:09:31.563]  No, please enlighten us.
[03:09:31.563 --> 03:09:32.263]  Okay.
[03:09:32.263 --> 03:09:40.426]  Sharon Palmer, single mom, California, goat farmer, makes goat cheese for sale in a farmer's market.
[03:09:40.426 --> 03:09:41.586]  She has both children.
[03:09:42.202 --> 03:09:53.912]  Just, I think it was December 18th, an undercover agent, here's another case of undercover agents, come into her farm that she had just moved to from another location, and begged her to buy cheese from her.
[03:09:53.912 --> 03:09:59.436]  Oh, she said, I can't sell cheese, you'll have to go to the farmer's market to buy it, because I can't sell it here at the farm.
[03:09:59.436 --> 03:10:06.522]  Well, he, may I get to the she, I forget, talked her into it, finally said, okay, I'll give you some cheese.
[03:10:06.522 --> 03:10:10.085]  So she gave the person some cheese, the undercover agent left,
[03:10:10.717 --> 03:10:16.360]  Sharon left a few minutes later, went down the road, and very shortly was arrested and brought back to the farm.
[03:10:16.360 --> 03:10:24.444]  Only to discover she was swarmed with undercover agents, enforcement agencies, which went over her farm to check it out.
[03:10:24.444 --> 03:10:26.125]  Meanwhile, they handcuffed this woman.
[03:10:26.125 --> 03:10:27.025]  Did you get that?
[03:10:27.025 --> 03:10:33.428]  Handcuffed her like a criminal druggie and threw her back in the back of their car.
[03:10:33.428 --> 03:10:34.789]  The creased cruiser.
[03:10:34.789 --> 03:10:37.130]  Then took her in, kept her overnight.
[03:10:37.130 --> 03:10:38.891]  The children were departed off to relatives.
[03:10:39.895 --> 03:10:41.998]  Well, the goats were left to fend for themselves.
[03:10:41.998 --> 03:10:43.300]  Kept her overnight.
[03:10:43.300 --> 03:10:43.941]  Alright.
[03:10:43.941 --> 03:10:44.782]  In jail.
[03:10:44.782 --> 03:10:45.703]  For what?
[03:10:45.703 --> 03:10:46.484]  Selling cocaine?
[03:10:46.484 --> 03:10:47.105]  No.
[03:10:47.105 --> 03:10:49.869]  Selling goat cheese.
[03:10:49.869 --> 03:10:51.071]  Did you get that?
[03:10:51.071 --> 03:10:52.112]  Food.
[03:10:52.112 --> 03:10:53.894]  We got something really wrong here.
[03:10:54.551 --> 03:11:00.216]  Yeah, just the fact that our undercover agents are spending time on this.
[03:11:00.216 --> 03:11:03.499]  It's not like anybody's complaining that they're getting sick from the food.
[03:11:03.499 --> 03:11:06.361]  The food is probably the healthiest food that you can get.
[03:11:06.361 --> 03:11:18.992]  It doesn't go through all these processes where, you know, they put all these nasty preservatives and, I mean, you can't even pronounce half the things that are in your food now.
[03:11:18.992 --> 03:11:21.674]  And even when you're buying produce, when you're buying, you know,
[03:11:23.335 --> 03:11:28.278]  A lot of that meat is now cloned when you go to Walmart or Price Chopper or these bigger chains.
[03:11:28.278 --> 03:11:33.960]  Your best bet is to go to these farmers markets and now the government is trying to regulate that so it's impossible.
[03:11:33.960 --> 03:11:35.061]  It's really bad.
[03:11:35.061 --> 03:11:44.946]  The story, the complete story on this Sharon Palmer case can be picked up at thecompletepatient.com if anyone's interested.
[03:11:44.946 --> 03:11:48.828]  Very, very, a lot of details are interesting.
[03:11:48.828 --> 03:11:51.729]  Mark McCarthy made a comment on that.
[03:11:52.789 --> 03:11:57.391]  Um, on that case, he said, this is totally, totally, totally ridiculous.
[03:11:57.391 --> 03:12:01.473]  We have, what we have here is tyrants posing as police officers.
[03:12:01.473 --> 03:12:06.475]  We have, we have people who have no conscience posing as police officers.
[03:12:06.475 --> 03:12:08.196]  It's really, really bad.
[03:12:08.196 --> 03:12:16.239]  It's like we are descending in some locations into like a Gestapo Nazi Germany situation.
[03:12:16.239 --> 03:12:17.920]  It's really, it's really bad.
[03:12:18.726 --> 03:12:26.012]  And you know, a lot of people can't even think that way because they honestly believe in this, you know, new president, hope, and change.
[03:12:26.012 --> 03:12:39.022]  I mean, it's been all over the television, but they don't realize that, all right, for instance, you know, a few months back a teacher got in trouble because he created his own Obama Youth Corps of young African American men, and just bring it up yourself.
[03:12:39.022 --> 03:12:41.625]  I mean, he's got them chanting Alpha Omega and, you know,
[03:12:42.385 --> 03:12:43.926]  I'm going to do this for Obama.
[03:12:43.926 --> 03:12:45.247]  So they don't see that.
[03:12:45.247 --> 03:12:47.408]  That's like a Nazi youth.
[03:12:47.408 --> 03:12:52.351]  Obama gave his global citizenship speech in Berlin, Germany.
[03:12:52.351 --> 03:12:54.072]  This guy is a front for the globalists.
[03:12:54.072 --> 03:13:00.515]  I think you're going to see not only regulation of food everywhere, but you're just going to see a massive regulation of everything from our economic system to
[03:13:01.656 --> 03:13:04.358]  I mean, possibly our roadways and our toll roads.
[03:13:04.358 --> 03:13:06.800]  I mean, they're talking about a new, new deal.
[03:13:06.800 --> 03:13:14.945]  You know, this is something that was done in the Great Depression, or to bring us out of the Great Depression by Roosevelt, and now the news is prepping us that we're in this other Great Depression.
[03:13:14.945 --> 03:13:25.352]  You'd think in a Great Depression, when people are going to have a hard time making money and buying food, that you'd want a lot of farms in this country to provide that food for people, but no.
[03:13:25.352 --> 03:13:28.414]  The government would rather regulate it and ship in poison for us.
[03:13:28.414 --> 03:13:28.975]  Why is that?
[03:13:30.893 --> 03:13:32.415]  It's unconscionable.
[03:13:32.415 --> 03:13:33.756]  I don't understand it.
[03:13:33.756 --> 03:13:35.878]  But we can fight back.
[03:13:35.878 --> 03:13:36.959]  We can fight back.
[03:13:36.959 --> 03:13:43.926]  There is an organization called Farm to Consumer Legal Defense Fund who is defending Sharon Palmer.
[03:13:43.926 --> 03:13:49.913]  This organization, along with the Buckeye Institute, is defending the Stowers in Ohio.
[03:13:49.913 --> 03:13:51.274]  And they can use help.
[03:13:51.989 --> 03:13:54.330]  Anyone has a buck or two they can send to these places.
[03:13:54.330 --> 03:13:56.452]  They can use help because we have to fight back.
[03:13:56.452 --> 03:13:58.773]  We've got to push the government back in this thing.
[03:13:58.773 --> 03:14:00.634]  We've got to push the government back.
[03:14:00.634 --> 03:14:05.837]  And why don't you give out some websites and phone numbers how people can help because, you know, now is the time.
[03:14:05.837 --> 03:14:07.998]  It's not to wait six months from now when it gets worse.
[03:14:07.998 --> 03:14:15.102]  It's already as bad as it could possibly get when, again, you have undercover agents going to small Mennonite farms.
[03:14:15.102 --> 03:14:17.223]  You know, I have a large Amish community where I am.
[03:14:17.223 --> 03:14:19.644]  I still go to the farmer's market, even where I live.
[03:14:20.905 --> 03:14:23.367]  Which is about an hour away from where the Amish Farmer's Market is.
[03:14:23.367 --> 03:14:25.688]  We have a farmer's market every week.
[03:14:25.688 --> 03:14:27.610]  And you can go get fresh produce.
[03:14:27.610 --> 03:14:30.992]  That might not be around six months or a year from now.
[03:14:30.992 --> 03:14:41.359]  Well, the primary agency that's fighting against the government on this is the Farmer to Consumer Legal Defense Fund.
[03:14:41.359 --> 03:14:42.720]  You can Google that.
[03:14:42.720 --> 03:14:45.842]  Find out where to send some money if you need to help them out.
[03:14:45.842 --> 03:14:49.084]  And we need to contact farmers
[03:14:49.992 --> 03:14:51.473]  On where to buy stuff.
[03:14:51.473 --> 03:14:53.415]  And there's national organizations.
[03:14:53.415 --> 03:15:00.081]  LocalHarvest.com is a clearinghouse for farmers to advertise their stuff on.
[03:15:00.081 --> 03:15:03.263]  RealMilk.com.
[03:15:03.263 --> 03:15:08.147]  Clearinghouse for finding where you get good stuff, good raw milk.
[03:15:08.147 --> 03:15:13.152]  Information about our PICFA organization is at info at PICFA.org.
[03:15:13.152 --> 03:15:16.955]  That's the Pennsylvania Independent Consumers and Farmers Association.
[03:15:16.955 --> 03:15:18.216]  We are battling
[03:15:19.059 --> 03:15:24.825]  To get the government out of the consumer-to-farmer relationship.
[03:15:24.825 --> 03:15:29.930]  If I can sell you a tomato or a carrot, I can sell you a quart of milk.
[03:15:29.930 --> 03:15:31.752]  It's my right as a farmer.
[03:15:31.752 --> 03:15:35.175]  If I want to buy it from a farmer, it is my right to go to him to buy.
[03:15:35.175 --> 03:15:41.922]  This thing of having to have permission to do what we've been doing for 10,000 years is totally unconscionable.
[03:15:43.191 --> 03:15:44.872]  Well, it shows the expansion of control.
[03:15:44.872 --> 03:15:48.134]  You know, it shows that they're never, ever, ever satisfied.
[03:15:48.134 --> 03:15:51.856]  They're not even satisfied with selling the majority of the public poison.
[03:15:51.856 --> 03:15:54.538]  They now want to sell all of the public poison.
[03:15:54.538 --> 03:16:00.342]  And why don't you just talk to some of the dangers of these GMO foods and why you should actually go to a farmer's market.
[03:16:00.342 --> 03:16:04.384]  Why you should buy fresh milk and produce from your local farmer.
[03:16:04.384 --> 03:16:10.728]  Well, the GMO things and the stuff that Monsanto has been passing off on the farmers to inject into their cows
[03:16:11.274 --> 03:16:11.754]  We're good to go.
[03:16:41.547 --> 03:16:51.770]  that are sprayed with this stuff comes right on through the finished product and the poison in the Roundup comes right on through and affects the people who eat it.
[03:16:51.770 --> 03:16:55.751]  The problem with this is most people are not aware of it.
[03:16:55.751 --> 03:17:00.732]  They just are not aware of it because the news media is squelching information.
[03:17:00.732 --> 03:17:10.835]  Getting back to the BHT, about a year ago there's two really good journalists on Fox News put together a documentary
[03:17:11.314 --> 03:17:13.756]  And that's on which documentary is that?
[03:17:13.756 --> 03:17:24.383]  I've actually seen that documentary where they were local reporters and they tried to report on it again and again and again and they were eventually let go and then they won a lawsuit against the news agency for wrongfully firing them, correct?
[03:17:37.639 --> 03:17:38.440]  That's correct.
[03:17:38.440 --> 03:17:39.560]  I think that's correct, yeah.
[03:17:39.560 --> 03:17:49.147]  Yeah, no, I'm all, man, I wish I could remember what doc it was, because it was a really good doc, and it shows you the control that these, you know, GM, like Monsanto is the devil, folks.
[03:17:49.147 --> 03:17:51.709]  I mean, these guys do not have your best interests at heart.
[03:17:51.709 --> 03:18:02.817]  They're not only about a bottom line, but they're literally about genetically modifying what we eat and put into our bodies and having total and complete control over what goes inside of us.
[03:18:02.817 --> 03:18:04.058]  Have you heard of Steve Hicks' case?
[03:18:04.449 --> 03:18:05.750]  No, no, definitely not.
[03:18:05.750 --> 03:18:07.750]  Tell us about Steve Hickson.
[03:18:07.750 --> 03:18:15.853]  Steve Hickson, a seat cleaner out in Illinois, his place was broken into, his address book, etc.
[03:18:15.853 --> 03:18:27.138]  was gone through, and I figure he possibly had a GPS put on his seat cleaning machine that tracked him to every one of the customers.
[03:18:27.138 --> 03:18:33.540]  Now, his customers are being served with papers being sued because Monsanto
[03:18:34.144 --> 03:18:36.886]  Thinks they're using Monsanto's seed.
[03:18:36.886 --> 03:18:39.128]  Probably isn't even the case.
[03:18:39.128 --> 03:18:42.311]  The seed cleaners are being, it's an attempt to put them out of business.
[03:18:42.311 --> 03:18:47.455]  FDA has found seed cleaners to be a source of contamination, which is crap.
[03:18:47.455 --> 03:18:50.257]  Seed cleaners merely clean the seeds, right?
[03:18:50.257 --> 03:18:57.343]  And so FDA is saying, well, we've got to put these guys out of business because they are going to contaminate the seeds with their seed cleaners.
[03:18:57.343 --> 03:19:01.386]  What they're really doing is cleaning the seeds for using next year.
[03:19:01.386 --> 03:19:02.687]  However, with Monsanto,
[03:19:03.854 --> 03:19:11.238]  You gotta buy new seed every year, and you gotta pay them their legal fee every year.
[03:19:11.238 --> 03:19:15.561]  Monsanto is putting people out of business, and the yield doesn't get any better.
[03:19:15.561 --> 03:19:29.009]  Have you heard anything about over in India where these farmers bought this BT cotton seed and it didn't work, and the farmers in India are thousands of them drinking Roundup to kill themselves because the stuff didn't work.
[03:19:29.009 --> 03:19:31.871]  Or rather, the BT cotton just didn't yield like they said it was gonna.
[03:19:32.478 --> 03:19:36.440]  And they're going, they're killing themselves to get out of there, out of debt.
[03:19:36.440 --> 03:19:37.841]  It's really sad.
[03:19:37.841 --> 03:19:45.744]  That is really sad, but you know, it just shows you a brutal corporation like Codex, or I'm sorry, Monsanto, is there to put the little guy out of business.
[03:19:45.744 --> 03:19:53.368]  And when you see Codex Elementarius being pushed and, you know, basically supposed to be pushed by 2012, we may not have a choice what goes in our body.
[03:19:53.368 --> 03:19:57.490]  It's P-I-C-F-A dot org, Infowars dot com, PrisonPlanet dot com.
[03:20:01.587 --> 03:20:07.433]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[03:20:07.433 --> 03:20:12.859]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[03:20:12.859 --> 03:20:18.244]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[03:20:18.244 --> 03:20:21.808]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar.
[03:20:22.088 --> 03:20:24.130]  Mental clarity and loss of weight.
[03:20:24.130 --> 03:20:30.354]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[03:20:30.354 --> 03:20:34.157]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[03:20:34.157 --> 03:20:38.981]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[03:20:38.981 --> 03:20:40.021]  Do your part.
[03:20:40.021 --> 03:20:42.623]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now!
[03:20:42.623 --> 03:20:48.768]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink
[03:20:49.068 --> 03:20:52.429]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[03:20:52.429 --> 03:20:53.190]  And we knew what to do.
[03:20:53.190 --> 03:20:54.510]  Or at least we thought we did.
[03:20:54.510 --> 03:20:59.692]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[03:21:18.957 --> 03:21:26.282]  EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[03:21:26.282 --> 03:21:33.386]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[03:21:33.386 --> 03:21:36.569]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[03:21:36.569 --> 03:21:42.332]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[03:21:42.332 --> 03:21:44.874]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[03:21:45.407 --> 03:21:51.451]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[03:21:51.451 --> 03:21:54.373]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[03:21:54.373 --> 03:21:59.297]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[03:22:01.576 --> 03:22:05.459]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[03:22:05.459 --> 03:22:06.861]  dollar has been devaluating.
[03:22:06.861 --> 03:22:10.744]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[03:22:10.744 --> 03:22:13.667]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[03:22:13.667 --> 03:22:15.728]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[03:22:15.728 --> 03:22:18.030]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[03:22:19.091 --> 03:22:33.579]  If you had had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800, but your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[03:22:33.579 --> 03:22:36.861]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.

[03:23:00.635 --> 03:23:02.317]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[03:23:02.317 --> 03:23:04.059]  What does humidity mean to you?
[03:23:04.059 --> 03:23:06.742]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[03:23:06.742 --> 03:23:11.888]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[03:23:11.888 --> 03:23:15.071]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.

[03:25:29.416 --> 03:25:31.477]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:25:31.477 --> 03:25:34.620]  And that's David Eisen with the Real Milk Song.
[03:25:34.620 --> 03:25:41.485]  Hopefully all you people that called in and hated on me for having Metallica on will now forgive me for having
[03:25:42.580 --> 03:25:49.385]  The Real Milk Song and Jonas Stolzfus of the Pennsylvania Independent Consumer and Farmers Association.
[03:25:49.385 --> 03:25:53.048]  That's P-I-C-F-A dot org.
[03:25:53.048 --> 03:25:59.853]  And, you know, these guys are on the front lines for trying to get you non-GMO, fresh foods.
[03:25:59.853 --> 03:26:00.834]  You know, not only milk.
[03:26:01.835 --> 03:26:04.157]  Not only cheese, but produce as well.
[03:26:04.157 --> 03:26:19.067]  And it's all under attack from these big corporations and the federal government sending in sting squads, you know, undercover police officers to try to entrap people, like, literally begging to sell a... for a woman farmer to sell a block of cheese.
[03:26:19.067 --> 03:26:20.729]  That's what the feds are up to.
[03:26:20.729 --> 03:26:22.770]  You know, you think that they're fighting terrorism all the time?
[03:26:22.770 --> 03:26:23.150]  No.
[03:26:23.150 --> 03:26:24.832]  They're here to go after the common man.
[03:26:24.832 --> 03:26:25.932]  I mean, it's the same thing.
[03:26:25.932 --> 03:26:29.435]  I mean, it's just unbelievably... Jonas, how are we going to overcome this?
[03:26:30.694 --> 03:26:36.359]  Dave, I have to think of my buddy David just got done singing that song for us.
[03:26:36.359 --> 03:26:41.423]  The way we overcome this is to get into action.
[03:26:41.423 --> 03:26:45.186]  First of all, find a farmer and buy from them.
[03:26:45.186 --> 03:26:47.468]  That way he can survive.
[03:26:47.468 --> 03:26:50.331]  And of course I gave you a couple of websites on how to find a farmer.
[03:26:50.331 --> 03:26:53.133]  LocalHarvest.com, RealMilk.com.
[03:26:53.133 --> 03:26:57.537]  Go to your local farmer's market, get to know the people, talk to them.
[03:26:58.393 --> 03:27:03.657]  Because there's where you will get food that will help you stay healthy.
[03:27:03.657 --> 03:27:06.620]  A moment ago, you talked about them going after the consumers of this.
[03:27:06.620 --> 03:27:08.861]  They went after somebody's list of customers.
[03:27:08.861 --> 03:27:11.383]  I mean, that is just crazy to me.
[03:27:11.383 --> 03:27:12.604]  And how did this even come about?
[03:27:12.604 --> 03:27:22.732]  Well, in this case, it's Monsanto going after the seed producers and going after farmers who are keeping their seed and using it over again like they've been doing for centuries.
[03:27:22.732 --> 03:27:25.835]  This is Monsanto attempting to get control
[03:27:26.508 --> 03:27:29.891]  of the seeds and thus the food.
[03:27:29.891 --> 03:27:31.512]  But that's a great, great big thing.
[03:27:31.512 --> 03:27:40.218]  But we can fight back as consumers by demanding that our government labels the food as made with GMO.
[03:27:40.218 --> 03:27:42.220]  Right now it's about 90%.
[03:27:42.220 --> 03:27:45.623]  But the consumers have a right to know how that food's made.
[03:27:45.623 --> 03:27:47.004]  They have a right to know.
[03:27:47.004 --> 03:27:55.230]  But as consumers wise up and educate themselves as to the health deficiencies that this halfway food
[03:27:56.114 --> 03:28:00.996]  is given us, and this is why we have such a health problem in this country.
[03:28:00.996 --> 03:28:04.857]  We are not eating nutrient-dense food.
[03:28:04.857 --> 03:28:14.160]  The Weston A. Price Foundation has been pushing the idea of eating properly, eating wisely, eating healthy.
[03:28:14.160 --> 03:28:20.001]  There's so much research that proves that this is the right way to go.
[03:28:20.001 --> 03:28:24.163]  Now, some of the problem is with the GMO is that no one's researching it.
[03:28:24.163 --> 03:28:25.423]  We are all guinea pigs.
[03:28:26.948 --> 03:28:29.250]  That's a great way to put it.
[03:28:29.250 --> 03:28:30.772]  We are all guinea pigs for this.
[03:28:45.848 --> 03:28:46.909]  There's a pretty much documented fact
[03:29:15.353 --> 03:29:17.454]  We have a case of a foster child at our home.
[03:29:17.454 --> 03:29:19.316]  We kept her for about two weeks.
[03:29:38.669 --> 03:29:43.792]  She came to our home and she screamed 18 hours of every day for about two days.
[03:29:43.792 --> 03:29:45.433]  And that was all due to the milk, Jonas.
[03:29:45.433 --> 03:29:50.515]  Jonas Stolfitz of the Pennsylvania Independent Consumers and Farmers Association.
[03:29:50.515 --> 03:29:51.976]  P-F-I-A-C dot org.
[03:29:51.976 --> 03:29:53.277]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.277 --> 03:29:54.878]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:54.878 --> 03:29:58.480]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.786 --> 03:30:10.248]  There is growing evidence that Americans would have better health and a lower incidence of cancer and fibrocystic disease of the breast if they consumed more iodine.
[03:30:10.248 --> 03:30:25.372]  Nutriodine iodine is formulated to work with your body to help to stimulate proper hormonal balance and can assist in detoxification from fluoride, bromide and chloride toxins and helps provide protection from radioactive iodine from nuclear fallout.
[03:30:25.372 --> 03:30:30.193]  Nutriodine is made with a proprietary high energy field from pure crystalline iodine.
[03:30:30.293 --> 03:30:33.454]  Neutriodyne should be used by all ages every day.
[03:30:33.454 --> 03:30:41.678]  If you suffer from chronic fatigue, low thyroid, and mitochondria function, or if you just want to feel better from day to day, Neutriodyne drops are for you.
[03:30:41.678 --> 03:30:43.539]  There are several forms of iodine.
[03:30:43.539 --> 03:30:46.020]  Neutriodyne is the only trusted source.
[03:30:46.020 --> 03:30:47.060]  Available now by calling 888-212-8871.
[03:30:47.060 --> 03:30:47.580]  That's 888-212-8871.

[03:30:56.544 --> 03:30:59.648]  Today unlike any other in the long course of American history a terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:30:59.648 --> 03:31:01.170]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[03:31:11.614 --> 03:31:12.995]  Who is the enemy?
[03:31:12.995 --> 03:31:13.775]  Bin Laden.
[03:31:13.775 --> 03:31:14.775]  This is his ammo.
[03:31:14.775 --> 03:31:16.056]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:31:16.056 --> 03:31:18.157]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[03:31:18.157 --> 03:31:25.300]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[03:31:25.300 --> 03:31:25.780]  Some U.S.
[03:31:25.780 --> 03:31:31.423]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:31:32.123 --> 03:31:35.624]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:31:35.624 --> 03:31:38.425]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[03:32:02.116 --> 03:32:12.705]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[03:32:12.705 --> 03:32:14.126]  Garden in a Can!
[03:32:14.126 --> 03:32:18.269]  Garden in a Can is your source for premium long-term storable seeds.
[03:32:18.269 --> 03:32:20.271]  Garden in a Can is ready when you are.

[03:32:32.722 --> 03:32:34.143]  Garden in a can.

[03:32:35.344 --> 03:32:36.045]  Fresh.
[03:32:36.045 --> 03:32:36.905]  Healthy.

[03:33:07.790 --> 03:33:09.111]  Alright folks, we are back.
[03:33:09.111 --> 03:33:10.372]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:10.372 --> 03:33:12.254]  I am Jason Burmas, sitting in all week.
[03:33:12.254 --> 03:33:17.319]  We just got done with Jonas Stolzfitz of the Pennsylvania Independent Consumer and Farmers Association.
[03:33:36.271 --> 03:33:37.394]  But that's not the end of the story.
[03:33:37.394 --> 03:33:38.337]  We actually now have...
[03:33:39.372 --> 03:34:01.987]  Maurice Thompson of the Buckeye Institute, and they were called to action, basically the Buckeye Institute's 1851 Center for Constitutional Law, today took legal action, that was in December 17th, against the Ohio Department of Agriculture and the Lorain County Health Department for violating the constitutional rights of John and Jacqueline Stowers of Lorain, Ohio.
[03:34:01.987 --> 03:34:05.910]  The Stowers operate an organic food cooperative called Manna Storehouse, biblical reference,
[03:34:06.830 --> 03:34:14.813]  ODA and Lorain County Health Department agents forcefully raided their home and unlawfully seized the family's personal food supply, cell phones, and personal computers.
[03:34:14.813 --> 03:34:23.476]  See, they don't just take your phone, they take your food, they take your phone and your technology, really just like not only crippling your business, but your day-to-day life.
[03:34:23.476 --> 03:34:24.917]  They're really nice people.
[03:34:24.917 --> 03:34:28.398]  The legal center seeks to halt future similar raids.
[03:34:28.398 --> 03:34:29.018]  I hope so.
[03:34:29.018 --> 03:34:31.959]  I hope that the Buckeye Institute can do that.
[03:34:31.959 --> 03:34:33.800]  The complaint was filed in Lorain County Court.
[03:34:34.700 --> 03:34:40.368]  Of Common Pleas, the use of these police state tactics on a peaceful family is simply unacceptable.
[03:34:40.368 --> 03:34:49.720]  Buckeye Institute President David Hanson said, officers rushed into the Stowers' home with guns drawn and held the family, including 10 young children, captive for six hours.
[03:34:51.783 --> 03:34:53.684]  This is a farmhouse family.
[03:34:53.684 --> 03:34:55.846]  I mean, ten kids and they have a farm?
[03:34:55.846 --> 03:35:00.049]  God forbid they feed their kids with the food they grow.
[03:35:00.049 --> 03:35:05.413]  This outrageous case of bureaucratic overreach must be addressed and I couldn't agree more.
[03:35:05.413 --> 03:35:09.576]  Mr. Thompson, thank you for joining us.
[03:35:09.576 --> 03:35:13.139]  Why don't you first tell people about the organization and then how they can get involved.
[03:35:14.272 --> 03:35:14.792]  Absolutely.
[03:35:14.792 --> 03:35:17.474]  Well, our organization is the Buckeye Institute.
[03:35:17.474 --> 03:35:21.036]  I run the 1851 Center, which is our legal arm.
[03:35:21.036 --> 03:35:42.948]  We litigate constitutional issues that basically implicate people's rights to be left alone by the government, and that comes in a myriad of forms, including lower taxes, less government spending, less government regulation, property rights, and the right to contract issues, like we have here, police state-type issues.
[03:35:44.676 --> 03:35:55.905]  The Buckeye Institute itself is also a think tank, so it writes policy papers and argues for limited government across multiple areas.
[03:35:55.905 --> 03:36:00.629]  Also, education reform is an important issue we focus on.
[03:36:00.629 --> 03:36:06.174]  The best way to get involved is probably to go to our website, which is www.buckeyeinstitute.org.
[03:36:06.750 --> 03:36:07.270]  We're good.
[03:36:26.232 --> 03:36:38.372]  And there they'll also be able to view our legal filings in the case and follow the case as it proceeds through the courts, and also our press release, which gives a nice, much shorter description and is much easier to read than the legal filings themselves.
[03:36:39.195 --> 03:36:42.556]  Yeah, it's absolute insanity that they raid a family of twelve.
[03:36:42.556 --> 03:36:54.179]  I mean, you know, the adults, the ten kids, they hold them hostage for six hours, they take not only their food supply, you know, but the food supply that they're going to live off, basically their way of living, and then that's not enough.
[03:36:54.179 --> 03:37:02.401]  You know what, we're going to take your phones and your computers, we're going to see who your customers are and who you're contacting, and they're probably going to run, you know, undercover SWAT teams on them as well.
[03:37:03.101 --> 03:37:11.746]  Well, the one thing that you neglected to mention, your otherwise excellent introduction of the issue, was the reason for this raid.
[03:37:11.746 --> 03:37:27.974]  And I think that a lot of your listeners, I think I've been on the show before, and a lot of your listeners may already be familiar with the issue, but this is a case where a group of police officers show up and engage in SWAT-like tactics, force their way into the house with guns drawn.
[03:37:28.755 --> 03:37:39.579]  The lead officer is an officer of the Violent Fugitive Task Force, and the family is rounded up and held while multiple agents come in and comb over the entire property.
[03:37:39.579 --> 03:37:47.802]  But the lead-up to that is just as important, and it's important that your listeners understand what precipitated this raid.
[03:37:47.802 --> 03:37:52.043]  And these people aren't crack dealers.
[03:37:52.043 --> 03:37:54.524]  They're not engaging in any kind of violent crime.
[03:37:55.274 --> 03:38:00.339]  Their crime, in the government's eyes, was doing business without the proper license.
[03:38:00.339 --> 03:38:02.901]  Yeah, and selling a dozen eggs.
[03:38:02.901 --> 03:38:04.663]  A dozen eggs!
[03:38:04.663 --> 03:38:05.624]  That's correct.
[03:38:05.624 --> 03:38:18.916]  That was the only transaction that the government used to justify this raid and to argue that this is a retail food establishment doing business without a retail food establishment license.
[03:38:19.708 --> 03:38:20.609]  It's totally insanity.
[03:38:20.609 --> 03:38:22.850]  I mean, you can go get a dozen eggs for less than two dollars.
[03:38:22.850 --> 03:38:28.692]  Here they are spending thousands of dollars to ruin a family's way of life, really.
[03:38:28.692 --> 03:38:33.294]  I mean, what are these guys supposed to do without their crop, without their food?
[03:38:33.294 --> 03:38:35.455]  They have a family of ten to feed.
[03:38:35.455 --> 03:38:36.376]  I mean, this is just...
[03:38:37.216 --> 03:38:42.240]  It's beyond insanity, and like you said, you know, these aren't crack dealers, this isn't somebody with a meth house.
[03:38:42.240 --> 03:38:52.769]  These are people who are genuinely trying to help other people stay healthy, and doing so in really a constitutional manner, and that's why your institute has taken to the cause.
[03:38:52.769 --> 03:38:55.090]  Well, that's absolutely correct.
[03:38:55.090 --> 03:39:03.737]  To provide a little bit more background, what the Mana Storehouse basically is, is a family-run farm and food co-op.
[03:39:03.737 --> 03:39:05.459]  What the family does,
[03:39:06.235 --> 03:39:21.045]  Is that they take orders from their neighbors, other members of the co-op, and it is a private co-op, so this is not a, you know, a Giant Eagle or a Kroger's where anybody can walk in off of the street and purchase food, which is important since there are no arms-length transactions.
[03:39:21.045 --> 03:39:24.887]  Everybody that's a member of the co-op knows exactly where the food comes from.
[03:39:24.887 --> 03:39:34.834]  It comes from local farmers, mostly Amish and Mennonite farmers in this very rural area, and they've sought out the Stowers family in the Manistore house.
[03:39:35.325 --> 03:39:57.011]  Because the Stowers family has connections to farmers who engage in farming practices that all these people have sought after and approve of, namely pesticide-free produce, grass-fed cattle, grass-fed chicken as well, pastured chicken.
[03:39:57.011 --> 03:40:00.312]  So these people have been sought out, and they've freely entered into a contract
[03:40:00.874 --> 03:40:03.334]  with the Stowers for the provision of this food.
[03:40:03.334 --> 03:40:05.575]  What they do is they order in bulk together.
[03:40:05.575 --> 03:40:20.658]  You and I may not be able to either afford or store a 55-gallon drum of wheat or the meat from one entire cow, but if we purchase it together, we can each afford it, and then we can split it up as well and then have a place to store it.
[03:40:20.658 --> 03:40:27.039]  That's the premise of a co-op, and that's exactly what has been going on up with the Manor Storehouse.
[03:40:28.183 --> 03:40:30.484]  And this is of the most fundamental type of behavior.
[03:40:30.484 --> 03:40:38.809]  This is the kind of behavior that many people engage in in this form and other forms of the country today, and that certainly our grandparents engaged in.
[03:40:38.809 --> 03:40:46.933]  You know, how many of us don't have a grandparent that maybe drove down the road to buy some local produce from the local farmer at one time or another?
[03:40:47.438 --> 03:40:51.460]  Yeah, my grandfather had his own little, you know, little, it wasn't much of a farm.
[03:40:51.460 --> 03:40:57.544]  I mean, he'd grow his own produce in the back and it's something we used to do together when I was a small child and then we'd harvest it together and we'd eat it.
[03:40:57.544 --> 03:41:01.206]  I mean, he used to grow watermelons and cucumbers and carrots.
[03:41:01.206 --> 03:41:10.712]  It was actually a nice thing to do and then, you know, you actually have food that you can feed your kid or your grandkid with a clean conscience, God forbid.
[03:41:10.712 --> 03:41:16.836]  Sure, and the government's argument, and this is an argument by many state governments, not just Ohio's these days,
[03:41:17.566 --> 03:41:30.318]  Is that that kind of activity should be licensed and requires a retail food establishment license, which is the same kind of license that a very large commercial grocery store is required to have.
[03:41:30.318 --> 03:41:43.930]  And what this really gets us into, and I think the Alex Jones Show is excellent for always having individuals to discuss federal constitutional law on, but there's a very important conflict here that's going on in the state.
[03:41:44.745 --> 03:41:55.094]  And this is between something called the police power, which is the state's ability to regulate things, and our fundamental constitutional rights.
[03:41:55.094 --> 03:42:04.401]  And these two are conflicting, and courts aren't always making the right call on these issues, and that's one of the reasons the Buckeye Institute's 1851 Center came into existence.
[03:42:07.645 --> 03:42:10.546]  A lot of people may have heard of this term, police power.
[03:42:10.546 --> 03:42:11.646]  What does this really mean, though?
[03:42:11.646 --> 03:42:15.547]  It actually has nothing to do with the police themselves.
[03:42:15.547 --> 03:42:21.929]  What this is, is the power that government has to enforce laws against people who injure other people.
[03:42:21.929 --> 03:42:35.833]  In other words, most of us believe in the Lockean social compact theory of government, that we were all free individuals first, when we had rights from God, and that we had inalienable and natural rights from God, and that we came together and formed governments
[03:42:36.644 --> 03:42:40.507]  Only to protect ourselves from injury from others and to protect our property.
[03:42:40.507 --> 03:42:44.490]  That that was the fundamental, original reason for government.
[03:42:44.490 --> 03:42:52.257]  And so, instead of engaging in vigilantism, we delegated to government the authority to enforce these rights on our behalf.
[03:42:52.257 --> 03:42:53.818]  That's the police power.
[03:42:53.818 --> 03:42:56.200]  And that's really the only legitimate power of government.
[03:42:57.116 --> 03:43:07.643]  You know, you juxtapose that with our natural rights, our rights to be free, to use and to acquire property, and for adults to enter into contracts that are voluntary.
[03:43:07.643 --> 03:43:24.916]  And there's no question here that state governments don't have the authority to regulate this type of behavior, and that our fundamental rights are certainly at issue in these kinds of cases, dealing with these kinds of contracts and this type of property.
[03:43:25.843 --> 03:43:43.358]  And this is certainly the type of behavior that the people engaged in at the time the Constitution was founded, which is also important because most states have residual rights clauses that indicate that rights are retained by the people where they're not delegated to government.
[03:43:43.358 --> 03:43:49.003]  And we have one of those at the federal level, it's called the Ninth Amendment, and most states also have those.
[03:43:49.003 --> 03:43:53.006]  What that means is that your constitutional rights aren't just the rights
[03:43:53.547 --> 03:43:55.629]  They're specified in the Constitution.
[03:43:55.629 --> 03:44:04.598]  They include also unenumerated rights that are so infinite that they couldn't all be imagined and put into paper, as James Madison said when he passed the Ninth Amendment.
[03:44:05.979 --> 03:44:09.843]  Absolutely, and you know, this is a grab for more power.
[03:44:09.843 --> 03:44:12.426]  So I want to know, number one, where is this case at?
[03:44:12.426 --> 03:44:14.408]  Obviously, it's a relatively new case, the Stowers.
[03:44:14.408 --> 03:44:16.570]  And then how can people get involved to help this family?
[03:44:16.570 --> 03:44:22.397]  Because I'm sure they're going to need help, not only on the legal end, but if they took all their food, they're probably going to need some financial help as well.
[03:44:22.397 --> 03:44:23.418]  How can people get involved?
[03:44:23.418 --> 03:44:26.040]  How can people help the Buckeye Institute and the Stowers family?
[03:44:27.066 --> 03:44:27.486]  Sure.
[03:44:27.486 --> 03:44:31.668]  Well, first off, your first question was as to the status of the case.
[03:44:31.668 --> 03:44:34.310]  We filed our complaint approximately one month ago.
[03:44:34.310 --> 03:44:36.011]  Not quite that long ago, in fact.
[03:44:36.011 --> 03:44:37.852]  So it is a relatively new case.
[03:44:37.852 --> 03:44:40.653]  The raid was just on December 1st.
[03:44:40.653 --> 03:44:46.076]  And at that time, soon after the raid, the prosecutor, the local prosecutor up there,
[03:44:46.956 --> 03:44:53.740]  Um, got on the media and dumped his chest and indicated he was going to be filing charges against this family.
[03:44:53.740 --> 03:44:58.383]  So we, uh, that, that certainly caught our attention along with the rate itself.
[03:44:58.383 --> 03:45:07.088]  So we, uh, we decided we would beat the prosecutor over the courthouse and go ahead and file a lawsuit against them before they filed any against our clients.
[03:45:07.088 --> 03:45:09.710]  Um, right now our complaint's been filed.
[03:45:09.710 --> 03:45:12.632]  We're awaiting an answer from the government.
[03:45:12.632 --> 03:45:12.672]  Uh,
[03:45:13.564 --> 03:45:20.428]  From that time, maybe about a month from now, maybe a little longer than that, a preliminary injunction hearing will be held.
[03:45:20.428 --> 03:45:21.628]  And that'll be a full-blown hearing.
[03:45:21.628 --> 03:45:29.492]  We'll have a chance to hear from these officers and from these government agents as to why they did what they did, which should be very interesting.
[03:45:29.492 --> 03:45:36.956]  And at that time, the judge will also have an opportunity to enjoy the behavior
[03:45:37.725 --> 03:45:46.691]  of the government, and to stop them from doing this, at least preliminarily, while the case proceeds over the course of normal channels.
[03:45:46.691 --> 03:45:55.718]  As to what your listeners can do to get involved, I would certainly urge them to speak with the ODA about this matter.
[03:45:55.718 --> 03:45:58.380]  You know, there are a number of bad actors here.
[03:45:58.380 --> 03:46:04.684]  The local health department was certainly a bad actor, and the Lorain County Health Department certainly deserves some flack.
[03:46:05.427 --> 03:46:07.409]  As does the Ohio Department of Agriculture.
[03:46:07.409 --> 03:46:11.393]  They treated this like a drug raid from the outset and a drug investigation.
[03:46:11.393 --> 03:46:12.454]  They surveilled the family.
[03:46:12.454 --> 03:46:16.758]  They went undercover and lied to the family to try to become a member of the co-op.
[03:46:16.758 --> 03:46:27.348]  And ultimately, the Ohio Department of Agriculture agent got those eggs that you mentioned earlier by staying at the family's house for two hours and refusing to leave without them.
[03:46:27.970 --> 03:46:31.452]  And so finally, they just gave him the eggs and he slapped some money down on the table.
[03:46:31.452 --> 03:46:36.134]  And that was the alleged retail transaction that you referred to.
[03:46:36.134 --> 03:46:38.975]  There are a lot of bad actors here that deserve a lot of flack.
[03:46:38.975 --> 03:46:45.658]  And of course, ultimately, the governor of Ohio is in control of the Department of Agriculture because it's an executive agency.
[03:46:45.658 --> 03:46:47.619]  So he deserves some heat as well.
[03:46:47.619 --> 03:46:57.644]  And it would be good for the court to know that people care about this case because, you know, judges are elected, prosecutors are elected, and that's the Lorain County Court of Common Pleas that's currently handling it.
[03:46:58.557 --> 03:47:03.279]  And the Sheriff up there is elected, so that's important.
[03:47:03.279 --> 03:47:08.802]  Perhaps more fundamentally than that, we're always appreciative of donations here at the Buckeye Institute.
[03:47:08.802 --> 03:47:11.703]  The website, again, is buckeyeinstitute.org.
[03:47:11.703 --> 03:47:16.726]  And the more donations we receive, the more cases like this we can handle.
[03:47:16.726 --> 03:47:25.770]  And that's quite important, because these paramilitary-style police raids are on the rise, and they're on the rise even in contexts like this, where there's
[03:47:26.514 --> 03:47:39.583]  Only an administrative infraction at issue and we want to have these off of the past before they become nationwide and before they become police's regular way of doing business in this country.
[03:47:39.583 --> 03:47:47.128]  So that will be quite important if you'd like to see us handle more cases like this one.
[03:47:47.128 --> 03:47:55.474]  Other than that, the phone calls are great and the family could also use support and if you do donate in your market for the family, we can get that support to them as well.
[03:47:56.602 --> 03:47:57.322]  Absolutely.
[03:47:57.322 --> 03:48:01.005]  So, listeners, you know, this is a case that you do need to get involved in.
[03:48:01.005 --> 03:48:03.986]  Like you said, you want to head these off at the pass.
[03:48:03.986 --> 03:48:11.410]  And, you know, the Buckeye Institute, they're institutes that are few and far between with a limited, you know, amount of people on the staff.
[03:48:11.410 --> 03:48:18.914]  I know I'm in an office with a limited amount of people on the staff, and it really is only through your funding that we're able to do more.
[03:48:18.914 --> 03:48:23.577]  And this is something that could probably go on court for a year or two, isn't it?
[03:48:24.577 --> 03:48:36.684]  Well, the way that these things typically work in Ohio, and I think in most states, is that trial court judges are kind of the low man on the totem pole, and they're very risk-averse.
[03:48:36.684 --> 03:48:41.807]  They're very unlikely to make a significant constitutional decision on their own.
[03:48:41.807 --> 03:48:50.753]  So a lot of times, we will win these cases eventually, but you're right, a lot of times we'll win them in the appeals court, or even at the Supreme Court.
[03:48:50.753 --> 03:48:52.514]  We can't always win them at the trial court level.
[03:48:52.950 --> 03:49:00.272]  So it's true, these cases do take a lot more resources when you're asking the court to find the government's action unconstitutional.
[03:49:00.272 --> 03:49:03.233]  Because, you know, the court ultimately is part of the government, too.
[03:49:03.233 --> 03:49:08.355]  They're highly deferential to the government, more so than they should be under the Constitution.
[03:49:08.355 --> 03:49:15.937]  But they're highly deferential, especially to local governments, you know, because those are the people they bump into in the hallway, you know, in the courthouse every day.
[03:49:17.156 --> 03:49:29.168]  Exactly, they all collude with one another, and you're right, when you are taking on the establishment, when you're taking on the government, especially at a local level, your chances are not so great at, you know, being able to end the case and end it constitutionally.
[03:49:29.168 --> 03:49:34.993]  You often do have to go to the appeals court or a higher court in order to do so, and that takes a lot of funding, folks.
[03:49:34.993 --> 03:49:39.458]  It takes a lot of time, a lot of patience, and it takes institutes like the Buckeye Institute
[03:49:39.938 --> 03:49:43.840]  To take these on, because most people, you know, most people are in the dark about all this.
[03:49:43.840 --> 03:49:45.641]  They don't even understand why it affects them.
[03:49:45.641 --> 03:50:01.328]  Well, when you can SWAT team an entire family for a dozen eggs, and that family includes ten children, and they treat it like a drug raid, like this guy is, you know, selling ecstasy from his front door, I think there's a huge problem with that.
[03:50:01.328 --> 03:50:03.348]  And that really is the whole story, by the way.
[03:50:03.348 --> 03:50:07.190]  Some of your listeners might be thinking, well, there's more to this.
[03:50:07.190 --> 03:50:08.091]  But there really isn't.
[03:50:09.437 --> 03:50:19.067]  Under the Fourth Amendment, one's home is his castle, and he's entitled to a certain amount of dignity and privacy and respect within that home.
[03:50:19.067 --> 03:50:28.056]  You know, it was the British soldiers showing up at your front door and writing their own search warrants after speaking with you if they didn't like your answers.
[03:50:28.056 --> 03:50:32.260]  It was ultimately one of the events that pushed the colonists here in America over the edge.
[03:50:33.164 --> 03:50:38.309]  And so you can't really, you cannot really put a price on how important these protections are.
[03:50:38.309 --> 03:50:39.230]  Absolutely.
[03:50:39.230 --> 03:50:43.594]  In this case, the family was not dangerous and they were not going to destroy the evidence.
[03:50:43.594 --> 03:50:47.838]  And we are fighting for that right to protect people's homes.
[03:50:47.838 --> 03:50:50.781]  Maurice Thompson of the Buckeye Institute, thank you so much for joining us.

[03:51:15.105 --> 03:51:21.868]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[03:51:22.208 --> 03:51:26.150]  And the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[03:51:26.150 --> 03:51:29.572]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[03:51:29.572 --> 03:51:31.332]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[03:51:31.332 --> 03:51:37.475]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[03:51:55.730 --> 03:51:56.932]  Truth is our weapon.
[03:51:56.932 --> 03:52:01.060]  And PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[03:52:01.889 --> 03:52:05.212]  So you've finally decided you're going to stock up and store food.
[03:52:05.212 --> 03:52:07.775]  But why settle for bland, tasteless food?
[03:52:07.775 --> 03:52:09.216]  Why settle for less?
[03:52:09.216 --> 03:52:10.838]  There is an alternative.
[03:52:10.838 --> 03:52:12.580]  InternetGrocer.net.
[03:52:12.580 --> 03:52:16.063]  Enjoy the most delicious, storable food at amazing prices.
[03:52:16.063 --> 03:52:19.947]  Enjoy creamy, delicious, real cheddar cheese in a can.
[03:52:19.947 --> 03:52:22.750]  Indulge in real canned meats and real canned butter.

[03:52:30.033 --> 03:52:32.354]  You can purchase by the can or by the case.
[03:52:32.354 --> 03:52:35.316]  Choose a variety pack or an entire year's worth of food.
[03:52:35.316 --> 03:52:40.438]  InternetGrocer.net has non-hybrid seeds that will produce delicious food for you and your family.

[03:52:45.659 --> 03:52:45.880]  Call 903-356-6443.
[03:52:45.880 --> 03:52:46.220]  That's 903-356-6443.
[03:52:46.220 --> 03:52:47.000]  Open from 9 a.m.
[03:52:47.000 --> 03:52:47.480]  to 6 p.m.
[03:52:47.480 --> 03:52:48.580]  Central Standard Time.

[03:52:50.181 --> 03:52:51.701]  Again, that's internet-grocer.net.
[03:53:01.724 --> 03:53:05.245]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[03:53:05.245 --> 03:53:10.647]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[03:53:10.647 --> 03:53:15.809]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[03:53:15.809 --> 03:53:26.933]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[03:53:27.333 --> 03:53:33.099]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[03:53:33.099 --> 03:53:39.385]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[03:53:39.385 --> 03:53:40.406]  What about you?
[03:53:40.406 --> 03:53:42.348]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally.
[03:53:42.348 --> 03:53:46.852]  $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[03:54:19.309 --> 03:54:22.615]  Personal Jesus.
[03:54:22.615 --> 03:54:26.181]  I'm probably going to get calls about that one too.
[03:54:26.181 --> 03:54:30.328]  Johnny Cash leaving us out in this last segment.
[03:54:30.328 --> 03:54:31.029]  Remember, you can get
[03:54:32.100 --> 03:54:36.842]  The entire four hours again over at Infowars.com right after this broadcast.
[03:54:36.842 --> 03:54:39.383]  We play it on a loop every day.
[03:54:39.383 --> 03:54:41.423]  That means you get us six times a day, folks.
[03:54:41.423 --> 03:54:42.884]  How many people offer that for free?
[03:54:42.884 --> 03:54:43.904]  Not many.
[03:54:43.904 --> 03:54:51.567]  And two hours of video broadcast for the PrisonPlanet.tv subscribers might explain that Metallica song that I played for most of you guys.
[03:54:51.567 --> 03:54:53.488]  I can't believe all the calls we got about it.
[03:54:53.488 --> 03:54:54.028]  But when you're
[03:54:54.628 --> 03:55:07.012]  When you're talking about eugenics, when you're talking about chemtrails, and you're a platinum-selling band, arguably the biggest band in the world, that's right, Metallica now, yeah, the Rolling Stones, they're gonna die soon, okay?
[03:55:07.012 --> 03:55:08.012]  They're not gonna be around forever.
[03:55:08.012 --> 03:55:09.532]  Metallica, they're gonna be around.
[03:55:09.532 --> 03:55:17.615]  They're probably the biggest band in the world, and when they're having social commentary on chemtrails, I think it's important, especially when they're pro-chemtrails.
[03:55:17.615 --> 03:55:18.775]  That has to be exposed.
[03:55:20.263 --> 03:55:29.271]  I want to remind listeners that Tyranny Crusher 1, that's Tyranny Crusher 1 right there, on eBay, is going for around 47 G's right now.
[03:55:29.271 --> 03:55:31.613]  We need the money to expand.
[03:55:31.613 --> 03:55:33.154]  There's a lot of empty offices here.
[03:55:33.154 --> 03:55:38.418]  Who knows, maybe it does well, Jason Burmess comes down to Austin, Texas, and he makes it his home.
[03:55:38.418 --> 03:55:41.561]  We'll pump out twice as many movies, folks, I promise you, if I come down here.
[03:55:41.561 --> 03:55:44.944]  Either that or I'll die an early death from no sleep at all.
[03:55:46.687 --> 03:55:47.607]  All right.
[03:55:47.607 --> 03:55:52.990]  Remember, Tyranny Crusher 1, if you've got the money out there, I know there are some pretty big celebrities that listen to this show.
[03:55:52.990 --> 03:55:58.092]  I don't know if they stay tuned for me, but, you know, if you're listening out there, we could use the scratch over here.
[03:55:58.092 --> 03:56:01.713]  Everything gets put into new offices, you know, new films.
[03:56:01.713 --> 03:56:02.134]  There it is!
[03:56:02.134 --> 03:56:04.034]  There's Tyranny Crusher 1.
[03:56:04.034 --> 03:56:05.475]  And, uh, just the expansion.
[03:56:05.475 --> 03:56:07.676]  I mean, Aaron works so hard here.
[03:56:07.676 --> 03:56:11.437]  Rob works so hard to see them both get, you know, the office that they deserve.
[03:56:11.437 --> 03:56:12.178]  It's great, you know.
[03:56:13.633 --> 03:56:16.375]  We've got Jaren here now.
[03:56:16.375 --> 03:56:18.436]  Paul Hartman's been here for a while.
[03:56:18.436 --> 03:56:19.397]  He came in over the summer.
[03:56:19.397 --> 03:56:21.739]  It's just an expanding, great crowd.
[03:56:21.739 --> 03:56:26.962]  And if you want us to expand, you want us to get slicker, you want us to reach more people, we need that support.
[03:56:26.962 --> 03:56:29.064]  And why not own Tyranny Crusher 1?
[03:56:29.064 --> 03:56:31.145]  This is a real piece of history.
[03:56:31.145 --> 03:56:34.167]  Alright, let's go to the last three callers.
[03:56:34.167 --> 03:56:37.710]  You've got less than a minute to make your point, folks.
[03:56:37.710 --> 03:56:39.311]  Carla in Pennsylvania, what's on your mind?
[03:56:41.114 --> 03:56:45.855]  Um, I just was wondering what happened to your friend that made the first video with you.
[03:56:45.855 --> 03:56:48.416]  Are you talking about Dylan and Cory?
[03:56:48.416 --> 03:56:50.756]  Uh, I think his name's Cory.
[03:56:50.756 --> 03:56:52.517]  Yeah, yeah, they're still around.
[03:56:52.517 --> 03:56:57.198]  You know, uh, Cory's in college right now and Dylan's out in California working on some other project.
[03:56:57.198 --> 03:57:00.839]  I don't know if it's going to be Patriot related, but everybody's still working.
[03:57:00.839 --> 03:57:02.019]  Um, you know, I'm working on...
[03:57:02.992 --> 03:57:06.595]  Now my second film outside of the Loose Change series.
[03:57:06.595 --> 03:57:15.803]  I'm working on Invisible Empire, but you know, I've also put that on hold while I'm down here to work on the Obama film because it's an important film and I love Alex Jones' films.
[03:57:15.803 --> 03:57:17.745]  You know, I got to help out a little bit.
[03:57:17.745 --> 03:57:21.348]  Yeah, well we haven't heard much from them lately, so I was just wondering.
[03:57:21.348 --> 03:57:23.210]  Yeah, nope, they're out on the internet.
[03:57:23.210 --> 03:57:25.832]  Go check out MySpace.com, you can get a hold of them.
[03:57:25.832 --> 03:57:27.253]  I thank you for the call, Carla.
[03:57:27.253 --> 03:57:29.395]  Alright, let's go to Tom in Pennsylvania.
[03:57:29.395 --> 03:57:30.116]  Tom, what's on your mind?
[03:57:32.596 --> 03:57:36.982]  I had a comment on the milk thing.
[03:57:36.982 --> 03:57:45.155]  A way for this to be handled other than the co-ops is for the people who are actually going in to get milk to
[03:57:45.922 --> 03:57:48.484]  Buy cows from the guy.
[03:57:48.484 --> 03:57:50.506]  That way you're getting your own milk.
[03:57:50.506 --> 03:57:51.747]  You're not buying milk.
[03:57:51.747 --> 03:57:53.328]  You're not buying unprocessed milk.
[03:57:53.328 --> 03:57:56.831]  You're buying a cow, and you're using your own product.
[03:57:56.831 --> 03:57:57.992]  You know, that sounds great, Tom.
[03:57:57.992 --> 03:58:05.218]  Unfortunately, most people do not have a shed to keep that cow, nor a willing son or daughter to go milk that cow in the morning.
[03:58:06.399 --> 03:58:07.540]  I mean, it's a great idea.
[03:58:07.540 --> 03:58:11.023]  You know, you live in an apartment and it's also going to be a tight squeeze, you and the cow.
[03:58:11.023 --> 03:58:17.327]  I think that, you know, in general we should probably just stop prosecuting farmers for farming and selling us food that's good for us.
[03:58:17.327 --> 03:58:19.869]  That's probably what we should do.
[03:58:19.869 --> 03:58:21.930]  Folks, I want to thank you so much for joining me today.
[03:58:21.930 --> 03:58:23.752]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:58:23.752 --> 03:58:24.492]  I'm Jason Bermas.
[03:58:24.492 --> 03:58:32.718]  Remember, you can get my films, Fabled Enemies, Loose Change, Final Cut, and Alex's films, Endgame, 9-11 Chronicles, Truth Rising, over at Infowars.com right now.
