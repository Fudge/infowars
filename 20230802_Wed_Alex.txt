[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.000]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:59.960]  I've been on the air 29 years.
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.360]  And I would only air air raid sirens maybe once a year when there was a really particularly
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.320]  big crisis going on.
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.800]  Now you notice we start the show with it almost every day.
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.480]  It's a good archetypal symbol of you're under attack.
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.480]  This is very serious.
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.320]  This is not a drill.
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.720]  You're being bombarded.
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:25.160]  And this is the radical globalist transformation of the world into the post-industrial state.
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.720]  Now I have read the indictment against Trump that came out yesterday afternoon.
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.840]  And it's not about tooting our horn around here.
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.880]  But last Tuesday, it was even the show headline, I've asked the crew to dig it up because I
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:40.880]  said it right at the start of the show.
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:41.880]  It's not gonna be hard to find.
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:50.960]  I went on air and I said, from our courthouse sources, Trump will be indicted probably next
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:58.400]  Tuesday or Wednesday, and then he will turn himself in on Thursday.
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:05.080]  That's now all transpired and they're ordering the president there on Thursday.
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.360]  And they're talking about clapping him in irons right there.
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.080]  They're trying to elicit a response.
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.600]  They're trying to elicit violence.
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.840]  They know they've culturally, politically lost us.
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.560]  They know the world's awakened to them.
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.640]  And even if we don't stage terror attacks or strike out violently, they're planning
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.600]  to trigger them and blame it on us.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.280]  This is very easy to predict.
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.240]  And what you're witnessing, if we don't thread the needle properly on this, is the real end
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.240]  of this republic.
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:41.600]  And we're not just gonna be some banana boat dictatorship like Venezuela when this is over.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:49.080]  This is gonna be the heart of evil that will make communist China blush at the tyranny.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.000]  Now, interspersed with all this news, we'll go through the indictment that's incredible.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.920]  Next segment, the indictments on all the charges that are all complete lies and fraud, that
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:12.840]  you notice that stocks sink after historic US credit rating downgrade.
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:19.440]  It's the IMF and World Bank positioning us to, again, live like folks do in Nigeria
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.720]  and Venezuela, our journey into slavery.
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.240]  I have CNN and Science Daily saying we must ban farms.
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.200]  Farming itself is evil and plants are bad.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.600]  Zelensky, we have video, says, nothing is enough for Ukraine.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.480]  That's a quote.
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.880]  Nothing is enough.
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.680]  And everybody else is obsessing over Hunter Biden.
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.000]  That's all a big tar baby.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.360]  He was always meant to be set up and Biden was meant to be set up as the big distraction
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.640]  while they bring down the country and bring down the populist movement that Trump leads.
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.840]  They'll give us a token at the end of Biden stepping down and Biden being his son being
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:03.840]  indicted.
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:11.640]  And then they'll later have the charges dropped like they did with Sam Bankman Freed who carried
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.600]  out a Ponzi scheme bigger than Bernie Madoff.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.320]  That tells you how things have changed.
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:27.000]  Sam Bankman Freed ripped over $30 billion off from investors, but that was okay because
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000]  he was giving it to the Democratic Party and the CIA and to Ukraine.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.320]  So we have a government totally at war with us.
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.240]  It's totally captured the top.
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.320]  And we've got a bunch of Republicans that basically are playing patty cake with it.
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:49.520]  Other than Trump, they're, they're, they're, they're engaged in quarter measures.
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.240]  Only leaders telling the truth are people like RFK Jr. and Trump.
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.240]  That's why they're both under attack.
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.240]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.280]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:08.720]  When hope and love has been lost and you fall to the ground, you must find a way.
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:15.840]  When the darkness descends and you're told it's the end, you must find a way.
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:22.040]  When God decides to look the other way and a clown takes the throne, we must find a way.
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:27.880]  You will find a way, dig down and find faith.
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:34.960]  When you're close to the edge, with a gun to your head, you must find a way.
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.960]  We have entered the fray and we will not obey.
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:46.960]  We must find a way and find faith.
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.960]  We won't let them divide.
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.960]  We will never abide.
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.960]  We will find a way.
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.040]  Infowars.com
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:13.040]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:19.040]  Live from Freedom Command Central, it's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:48.560]  Well, my friends, it's Wednesday, August 2nd, 2023, and I've been telling you for years
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:53.520]  that you would look back on the previous year as a cakewalk, and then you would look at
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:07:00.920]  that next year and the next year as a walk in the park, because we're in the New World
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:06.880]  Order now, and it's kind of like when an alligator, when you're fishing in Florida, decides to
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:11.000]  grab one of your kids, and you think it's bad when they got him by the leg and you see
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.920]  him drug into the water and disappear, but then you see it start spinning, and the blood,
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.640]  and you try to get it and save your child, but by the time you get there, they're torn
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:20.640]  into pieces.
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:28.320]  We're at the stage now of the child disappearing under the water, and now they're going to
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.480]  spin, spin, spin.
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:36.200]  I'm a pretty tough guy, and I knew this was coming for a long time, but I got to tell you,
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:40.600]  I've been doing a lot of praying and getting right with Jesus, because there's going to
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.640]  be full war with China and Russia.
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:49.440]  I mean, they plan to get rid of 90% of the people in the next seven years, and they mean
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:50.440]  to do it.
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:58.720]  They're cutting all the main energy systems off right now, worldwide, except in dictatorships,
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:02.520]  and they are just going to put us into a meat grinder.
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:08.320]  They'll do it by increments, though, always posing as the savior from the last crisis
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.480]  they created.
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:18.000]  So it's the first time it's ever happened on this scale, the U.S. credit rating has
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000]  been downgraded.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.240]  Kind of a big deal.
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:33.080]  Our journey towards a banana boat republic is well on its way, and it just goes faster
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.080]  and faster.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:41.280]  Stocks sink after historic U.S. credit rating downgrades.
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:42.720]  Debt tsunami begins.
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:47.880]  U.S. to sell $1 trillion in debt this quarter, second highest in history as budget deficit
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:56.760]  explodes.
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:03.360]  And now we enter the phase where the big banks, with their endless money, are paying farmers
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:08.280]  not to produce all over the world, and in many cases just banning them producing, and
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:14.680]  they're paying fertilizer production facilities to stop production.
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:20.240]  As John Kerry told us a month ago and again this week, he said, we've got to close at
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.800]  least a third of the farms to save the earth.
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:23.800]  Farms are bad.
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.200]  We've got to cut food production.
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:29.960]  At the same time, the U.N. says there's record starvation and mass death.
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:33.840]  Give us more money.
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:40.120]  Obviously, the big elephant in the room is the indictment of Trump, and this is the big
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.120]  one.
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:46.200]  I told you repeatedly last week, the exclusive, it was in one of the daily show headlines.
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.200]  I thought it was important enough.
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:58.720]  I said Trump to be indicted next Tuesday to turn himself in on Thursday, and that was
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:10.360]  directly from one of our people in the courthouse that heard them making their preparations
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.360]  for it.
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:19.000]  And the reason this is so important is it outlaws questioning elections, something the
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.840]  State Department's done since the end of World War II, officially going around and rating
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.280]  countries' elections.
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:28.080]  And the number one thing they say that shows you have a free country in your elections
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:31.480]  is that you can question elections.
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:38.360]  Go to the State Department's whole section on integrity of elections worldwide, ensuring
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:43.040]  elections are good, and they go all over the country, from Venezuela to South Africa
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:50.080]  to Iraq, to make sure that election's fair, boy, you know there's a big history of election
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:54.560]  fraud all over the world in history, but America's there to make sure it's good.
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:11:07.960]  And the number one thing, ladies and gentlemen, is making sure that you have a right to question
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:08.960]  it.
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:19.520]  Boy, it's a tall order to read Obama's indictment of the true president and the wildly popular
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:20.520]  candidate.
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:25.080]  This, of course, is the greatest example of open election meddling seen in world history.
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:30.760]  It's the most naked, most brazen, most out in the open.
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:37.320]  But bigger than that, it's outlawing the questioning of elections, something Democrats have famously
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:41.440]  done when it's obvious that they lost, but it's their right.
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:44.160]  No one ever said arrest them for it, at least I didn't.
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:48.680]  And we've got all the clips of Al Gore saying the same things Trump said, and we've got
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:58.480]  clips of Michael Moore saying it, and Maxine Waters, and basically all of them.
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:03.680]  But when Trump did what Obama did, getting alternate electors, just in case somebody
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:08.320]  challenged him, well, guess what?
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:12.360]  He didn't get in any trouble for setting them up in Hawaii and several other states.
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:18.360]  But oh, Jack Smith says in his indictment, oh, you've got free speech to question elections.
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:22.880]  And then he goes right into it saying, but you don't have the right.
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:29.760]  And they've got juries in DC, fabulously corrupt, that again, it's almost impossible to not
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.040]  be convicted by them.
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.040]  It's a cult.
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.040]  They all work for the system.
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.400]  They select them, they bring them in.
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:38.000]  It's a kangaroo court.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.360]  Trump indicted on charges related to efforts to overturn 2020 election.
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:47.240]  Look at this CNN front page, why Trump's new indictment will reverberate for years.
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:55.920]  The ex-presidents reacted by resorting to the same inflammatory language and anti-democratic
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:00.360]  rhetoric detailed in the indictment.
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.360]  What are they saying right there?
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:03.560]  He says this is tyranny.
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:06.840]  He says this is election meddling to take out a popular political candidate, which it
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.280]  is on its face.
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:11.360]  No one could deny that, that has above a 70 IQ.
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:17.200]  Hell, I bet somebody with a 70 IQ understands that.
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:21.480]  So they're all over the news, I've got stacks saying, yep, you question the election, we're
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:22.480]  going to arrest your ass.
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:26.680]  And they're all over Twitter, Instagram saying, arrest everybody.
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:31.000]  The members of Congress, Ted Cruz was going to write up a 10 day investigation that's
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000]  in the Constitution.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.920]  It's in the law.
[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:39.320]  And they tried to censure him and have him thrown out of the Senate.
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:40.320]  Election meddling.
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:46.040]  If Beto O'Rourke can't beat him at the ballot box, well, we'll just remove him too.
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:49.800]  All because a few hundred people attacked the police, most of them feds and DC police
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:51.160]  attacking Capitol police.
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:54.760]  And then the people behind it know they opened the doors up and just walked in the velvet
[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:57.240]  ropes.
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:00.760]  But the FBI and others that broke in, they're not in trouble, the ones that orchestrated
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:02.800]  it and told Congress they did.
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:11.080]  No, Ray Epps said, I orchestrated it, because he had his text messages bragging, but that's
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:16.360]  okay when you orchestrate it and you try to stop it like I did or Trump did, well then
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.360]  you're bad.
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.720]  But look at that.
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.640]  Why Trump's new indictment will reverberate for years.
[00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:27.160]  The ex-president reacted by resorting to the same inflammatory language and anti-democratic
[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:32.320]  rhetoric detailed in the indictment.
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:37.360]  By the way, all we got to do to find that by prediction, I think it was Monday or Tuesday,
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:41.880]  you go to the full show, it's archived at man.video, the on-show section.
[00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:43.980]  Want somebody singled out to do it, please.
[00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:49.880]  And just go to the front of each full show and I just say it right at the start.
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:51.960]  So it was the first few days of the week.
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.400]  I really want that.
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:54.400]  Okay.
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.400]  Thank you.
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:59.920]  Cruz is great, but I just got to have these things.
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.240]  I should have told him before the show.
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:13.000]  So again, the ex-president reacted by resorting, man, that speech is a bad thing, to the same
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:19.000]  inflammatory language and anti-democratic rhetoric detailed in the indictment.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.600]  He's doing what got him indicted again.
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.600]  There's no election fraud.
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:27.800]  There's no indicting a president over and over and over and over again because he's
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:33.880]  40, 50 points ahead, 60, 70 points ahead of the Republicans, 20 points, 30 points ahead
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:34.880]  of Biden.
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:39.720]  I mean, you know, indicting someone because they're incredibly popular while the globalists
[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:40.720]  got the country.
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:41.720]  I mean, that's not election meddling.
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:44.720]  I mean, maybe he'll get indicted for that, too.
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:45.720]  It's a lie.
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:48.640]  Jack Smith's not election meddling.
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:54.200]  And bears don't cramp in the woods and birdies don't flap around in the sky.
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:55.200]  Man.
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:56.200]  Whoo!
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:58.200]  We'll be right back.
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:06.200]  When hope and love has been lost and you fall to the ground, you must find a way.
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:14.200]  When the darkness descends and you're told it's the end, you must find a way.
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:21.200]  When God decides to look the other way and a clown takes the throne, we must find a way.
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.200]  You will find a way.
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:26.200]  Dig down and find faith.
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:34.200]  When you're close to the edge with a gun to your head, you must find a way.
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:37.200]  We have entered the fray and we will not obey.
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:46.200]  We must find a way and find faith.
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:49.200]  We won't let them divide.
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:52.200]  We will never abide.
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:54.200]  You will find a way.

[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:09.200]  So I get constant questions online and in person.
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:10.200]  Hey, what's better?
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.200]  Knockout.
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.200]  What's better?
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.200]  Down and out.
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.200]  What's better?
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:16.200]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.200]  And the answer is different herbal formulas.
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.200]  Different compounds are better for different people.
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:24.200]  So one person might like this coffee.
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.200]  Another person likes that coffee.
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.200]  That's how our bodies work.
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.200]  They're all very diverse.
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:34.200]  But we've been able to private label a national best seller that's been sold for many years that people love.

[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:02.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:07.200]  is a historic book that documents the global, in their own words, plan for our future.
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:08.200]  That is a hellish future.
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:12.200]  Now you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:18.200]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores, Amazon, or InfoWarsWare.com.
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:23.200]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:26.200]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:31.200]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed copy, at InfoWarsWare.com.
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:35.200]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.

[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.200]  You'll also know that you help keep InfoWars on the air.
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:45.200]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned copies.
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:51.200]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to InfoWarsWare.com and get a signed copy
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:55.200]  and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library or give them to the local school.
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:58.200]  This is an InfoWar, I'm counting on you, and thank you for your support.
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:07.840]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:28.310]  Now, when I point out that I keep giving you precise predictions that come true day after
[00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:33.510]  day, week after week, year after year, decade after decade, I don't do it to sit here and
[00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:35.429]  toot my horn.
[00:20:35.429 --> 00:20:45.470]  I remind you, I'm not playing games, and no one knows as much as I do when it comes to
[00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:48.389]  battling the New World Order, nobody.
[00:20:48.389 --> 00:20:53.590]  And I don't say that to act tough, I don't say that to brag, it's a fact.
[00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:58.030]  Nobody's got the record we've got, and it's because I'm immersed in this, this is what
[00:20:58.030 --> 00:20:59.030]  I do.
[00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:01.870]  I couldn't even sleep last night.
[00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:06.110]  So when I tell you this stuff, I'm not trying to scare you just to have fun, I'm trying
[00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:09.870]  to get people motivated to realize we are in deep crap.
[00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:13.110]  I just got deep chills, not the kind that are up your back, the kind that goes straight
[00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:14.870]  up through you.
[00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:22.230]  And that's because my physiological body understands that we are not in Kansas anymore.
[00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:25.710]  And I say that because I know as listeners, you are informed and you care as well, and
[00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:27.950]  you've got your head in the game, and I bet there's a lot of you out there that know more
[00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:30.350]  than I do, but you just don't have a talk show.
[00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:38.350]  In fact, let me rephrase what I said, I don't know the most about the New World Order of
[00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:45.250]  anybody in the world, I know the most of anybody on air, that's a big distinction.
[00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:49.110]  And that's why I need all of you to go speak at city council, county commission, start
[00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:53.629]  your own local shows, start your own internet shows, I don't care if there's 10 listeners,
[00:21:53.629 --> 00:21:58.470]  that's how it starts, it'll build to 1,000, 10,000, they can't stop us all.
[00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:02.710]  There are brown people, there are red people, there are yellow people, there are pink people,
[00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:06.110]  I guess there are a few whites that are actually white people, but most white people are pink
[00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:08.149]  people.
[00:22:08.149 --> 00:22:13.210]  All of us have the same soul and mind God gave us to varying degrees with different gifts,
[00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:19.470]  but you know what's going on, and with the censorship and control coming in, if the enemy
[00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:22.470]  wins the next round of this, you're going to have to do this person to person in the
[00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:23.470]  very near future.
[00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:28.030]  That's how dark the days are, and I just want to impress upon new listeners that this is
[00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:32.710]  not a game, that's why they found the clip, they're dragging it in right now, it was the
[00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:38.909]  28th, whatever day that was last week, 7-28-23, the full show, here it is, today I wore a
[00:22:38.909 --> 00:22:44.990]  white shirt, kind of a rarity, or a cream shirt, only shirt I had left that was clean,
[00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:49.790]  and I laid it out in the first 15 minutes, explosive, Trump indicted for January 6th,
[00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:55.629]  I told you it had been done, federal courthouse in D.C. preparing his arrest for next week,
[00:22:55.629 --> 00:23:01.090]  I said specifically they believed he'd be indicted Tuesday, turn himself in Thursday,
[00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:07.270]  but they said it might move to indictment on Wednesday, turn in Friday, but this came directly
[00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:16.909]  from the inside, so when I tell you that Biden throws fits and defecates himself before he
[00:23:16.909 --> 00:23:21.030]  started going on TV saying my butt's been wiped, I'm not making fun of him, that's scary
[00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:25.230]  that the president's a puppet like that, and he's falling off bicycles and falling upstairs
[00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:29.350]  and grabbing on kids everywhere, this is humiliating.
[00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:33.710]  I tell you that because the Secret Service is so freaked out, we now know attacked dozens
[00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:35.429]  of times by his dog commander.
[00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:43.689]  Biden's like stumbling around at the beach at night, looks like something out of The
[00:23:43.689 --> 00:23:46.470]  Thing.
[00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:51.889]  And what I tell you all this is because I'm going to tell you what's going to come next.
[00:23:51.889 --> 00:23:54.290]  I know what they're going to do next.
[00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:59.050]  And the fact that I know, and a lot of you, you know what I know, well, we better make
[00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:04.330]  sure everybody else knows it.
[00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:09.290]  You see this stack articles right here, this is exhibit one for Trump and the video clips
[00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:10.290]  we've got.
[00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:15.010]  But I'm telling you, folks, he can't get real lawyers because any real lawyer that defends
[00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:17.610]  him, they'll indict them too, which is what they're doing.
[00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:22.929]  They're indicting a bunch of his lawyers next that met with him and war game the election.
[00:24:22.929 --> 00:24:30.490]  And all they were doing was copying the strategy of John Podesta in The New York Times right
[00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:34.929]  before the election, saying we're going to get alternate electors.
[00:24:34.929 --> 00:24:38.610]  We're going to say there's election fraud and we're going to have our own inauguration
[00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:41.090]  even if the Supreme Court says he wins.
[00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:47.570]  That's way, I mean, that's like 50 times stronger than what Trump did.
[00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:53.129]  I mean, it's right here in The New York Times saying interviewing Podesta and Podesta gave
[00:24:53.129 --> 00:24:54.129]  him the document.
[00:24:54.129 --> 00:25:00.169]  I've got the document where the Democratic Party was officially going to no matter what.
[00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:06.649]  And I have Pelosi saying no matter what, we won't concede on MSNBC and on Meet the Press.
[00:25:06.649 --> 00:25:09.250]  I mean, I've got all these clips here in the stack today.
[00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:11.970]  I could do the whole rest of the show.
[00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:12.970]  Maybe we should.
[00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:16.610]  We got Roseanne Barr coming up and Roger Stone and more.
[00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:20.830]  But I could do the whole show and not even have time to talk.
[00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:21.830]  Just playing you clips.
[00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:31.190]  I've got a 25 minute compilation, 24 straight minutes of Democrats denying election results.
[00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:35.110]  Going back over the last two decades, way stronger than Trump.
[00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:40.429]  And Hillary saying that they would not accept it, on and on and on.
[00:25:40.429 --> 00:25:43.389]  And I'm talking about the 2020 election.
[00:25:43.389 --> 00:25:48.110]  So here's the headline where they war game it all, how the media could get the election
[00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:53.149]  narrative story wrong, okay?
[00:25:53.149 --> 00:25:54.190]  Here's another one.
[00:25:54.190 --> 00:26:02.710]  Here's the actual document, preventing a disrupted presidential election and transition.
[00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:10.590]  But in the document, it says we'll have an alternate inauguration in Colorado or another
[00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:11.590]  state.
[00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:18.030]  I mean, if Trump won, they'd call it a red mirage and then use the Maryland ballots to
[00:26:18.949 --> 00:26:19.949]  get him over the top, which they did.
[00:26:19.949 --> 00:26:20.949]  I mean, it's a confession.
[00:26:20.949 --> 00:26:25.990]  It's a battle plan.
[00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:31.629]  And you really could be indicted that after the Supreme Court rules through the battle,
[00:26:31.629 --> 00:26:40.350]  like they did for Bush in 2000, that even when the Supreme Court ruled that Biden had
[00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:46.030]  lost, they were going to not concede and have an alternate inauguration.
[00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:49.669]  Now, that's what they're accusing Trump of.
[00:26:49.669 --> 00:26:54.149]  This is illegal.
[00:26:54.149 --> 00:26:56.310]  Trump never got his investigations in the courts.
[00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:58.030]  They wouldn't even hear it.
[00:26:58.030 --> 00:27:02.669]  War games on Trump versus Biden race show risk of chaos.
[00:27:02.669 --> 00:27:04.949]  USA Today, all about it.
[00:27:04.949 --> 00:27:06.110]  And when's the document from?
[00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:07.110]  August 3rd, 2020.
[00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:09.550]  Look at the document right here.
[00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:14.590]  Go read it for yourself.
[00:27:15.149 --> 00:27:16.149]  USA Today about it.
[00:27:16.149 --> 00:27:17.149]  Trump could refuse to concede.
[00:27:17.149 --> 00:27:18.149]  Then they got their plan.
[00:27:18.149 --> 00:27:22.149]  Washington Post, how they'll steal it.
[00:27:22.149 --> 00:27:23.710]  So this is a big deal.
[00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:25.710]  We're going to go to break, come back.
[00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:30.550]  I'm going to play you just a short clip of the first 20 minutes or so of the show last
[00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:35.070]  week where I predicted all this on July 28th, and then I'm going to move in to the indictment.
[00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:39.190]  And man, I mean, I got a lot of other stuff to hit, but it all ties into this.
[00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:42.470]  But I'm going to have to get, I mean, over and over again.
[00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:47.669]  They say, and he's indicted for saying the election was a fraud, and he's indicted for
[00:27:47.669 --> 00:27:52.030]  meeting with people who agreed, and he said illegal aliens voted, and everyone knows no
[00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:53.030]  illegal aliens vote.
[00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:57.030]  A whole bunch of Democrat states let illegal aliens vote.
[00:27:57.030 --> 00:28:02.909]  I mean, type in illegals allowed to vote.
[00:28:02.909 --> 00:28:06.870]  Illegals sent voter registration cards.
[00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:11.230]  Zuckerberg spent how many millions of dollars?
[00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:16.350]  400 million, some insane number that doesn't even register it so big.
[00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:22.270]  It was over $400 million to get the names of all the dead people and the folks that
[00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:23.270]  had moved out of districts.
[00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:25.270]  You know, you moved from California to Texas.
[00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:28.590]  Oh, you didn't know you were going to be voting forever though in California, or you move out
[00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:29.870]  of Illinois to Arkansas.
[00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:33.909]  You didn't know you'd still be voting Democrat or whatever you voted for back in the other
[00:28:33.909 --> 00:28:34.909]  state.
[00:28:34.909 --> 00:28:37.270]  I mean, it's just, it's wild folks.
[00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:38.270]  It's wild.
[00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:40.990]  Didn't know your grandma died 20 years ago.
[00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:41.990]  Is she still voting?
[00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:42.990]  Didn't know that?
[00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:43.990]  Why?
[00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:46.230]  We're going to arrest you if you say that.
[00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:47.790]  I mean, look at the CNN headline.
[00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:50.110]  They say Trump's doing that illegal thing again.
[00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:51.550]  He says they're election meddling.
[00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:52.550]  Why?
[00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:53.550]  That's not true.
[00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:55.110]  You're not allowed to say that because we said so.
[00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:59.270]  We're Jack Smith.
[00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:03.710]  For everything the globalists hit us with, God through mother nature has given us the
[00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:04.710]  answer.
[00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:08.909]  I don't have to sell you on CBD oil, full spectrum CBD oil, the incredible things it
[00:29:08.909 --> 00:29:10.469]  does for your nerves, your brain.
[00:29:10.949 --> 00:29:16.149]  Now your entire physiological system for your nervous system particularly, everybody knows
[00:29:16.149 --> 00:29:17.149]  it's incredible.
[00:29:17.149 --> 00:29:18.149]  It works.
[00:29:18.149 --> 00:29:22.350]  We have the strongest, best CBD oil you're going to find anywhere at the lowest price.
[00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:29.230]  Yes, you can find this same CBD oil for 30% more because that's who we're getting it from.
[00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:31.870]  Made right here in Central Texas.
[00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:35.510]  Our private label name is Rebel Zen.
[00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:41.110]  Rebel Zen is a private label of one of the top three or four CBD makers in the country.
[00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:44.190]  It's based right here in Texas and we're giving it to you at 30% off.

[00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:04.210]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:08.690]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress, you may not be able to get all

[00:31:58.690 --> 00:32:03.889]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders, the war with Russia, the
[00:32:03.889 --> 00:32:09.610]  insanity, the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy, you are crazy, in my view, if
[00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:13.370]  you don't get high-quality, storable food and water filtration and self-defense.
[00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:15.770]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo.
[00:32:15.770 --> 00:32:18.770]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't, and I'm
[00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:23.010]  preaching the choir on that, but a lot of people got plenty of guns, but they don't have enough
[00:32:23.010 --> 00:32:25.290]  storable food or water filtration.
[00:32:25.290 --> 00:32:29.889]  This is something you need now, and we've got it in the food department and in the high-quality

[00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:07.640]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:26.070]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:28.070]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:30.070]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:35.070]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:48.550]  So, let's dig into this indictment and what this really means for the Republic, along
[00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:52.270]  with the credit rating in the United States being lowered, and the announcements to begin
[00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:57.590]  shutting down U.S. farms that's already begun in Europe and in Ireland and in Asia.
[00:33:57.590 --> 00:34:00.830]  You've seen the riots in Asian countries that started this a decade ago.
[00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:02.669]  It's all designed to implode society.
[00:34:02.669 --> 00:34:05.030]  I mean, this is true warfare.
[00:34:05.030 --> 00:34:11.350]  You see, in a high-tech, just-on-time delivery system, multi-crop economy, you can do incredible
[00:34:11.350 --> 00:34:12.350]  things.
[00:34:12.350 --> 00:34:16.870]  But when the technocrats are in control with policy and AI, they can selectively shut off
[00:34:16.870 --> 00:34:22.190]  any part of the economy they want and kill people en masse and cause incredible levels
[00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:24.910]  of instability and crime.
[00:34:26.010 --> 00:34:32.010]  An angrier world that Karl Schraub talks about to bring in the New World Order.
[00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:36.010]  But there's going to be populists that stand against it.
[00:34:36.010 --> 00:34:40.010]  The Bolsonaro's ban from running for office. Because why?
[00:34:41.010 --> 00:34:45.010]  Lula was advised by the State Department to say at their Supreme Court,
[00:34:45.010 --> 00:34:49.010]  he questioned the election, you can't do that, that's election meddling.
[00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:50.010]  No it's not.
[00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:54.010]  What's the number one rule the State Department uses until now?
[00:34:54.010 --> 00:34:58.010]  You decide if an election's free and fair, that you're allowed to investigate and question.
[00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:02.010]  But the big takeaway is this.
[00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:04.010]  They know they've lost the hearts and minds.
[00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:06.010]  They know the people are turning against them.
[00:35:06.010 --> 00:35:09.010]  They're cutting off the resources to make you so poor,
[00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:13.010]  you can't even be politically active so they can dictate the terms of your surrender.
[00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:19.010]  And they tried the Justice Department, they admit this in a 20-page article
[00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:22.010]  about myself and Trump and Roger Stone a month ago.
[00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:25.010]  They tried to indict myself and Roger and others,
[00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:28.010]  and they tried to connect us to the grassroots and up to Trump
[00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:32.010]  saying that Trump commanded us to have an insurrection, but there was no evidence.
[00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:38.010]  They subpoenaed our phone records, the telephone companies, everything.
[00:35:39.010 --> 00:35:41.010]  And of course it wasn't there, because I know it wasn't there,
[00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:44.010]  because we wouldn't walk into their trap.
[00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:47.010]  That's ridiculous to attack the Capitol as if that would make us win the election.
[00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:49.010]  That's preposterous.
[00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:51.010]  We were there to protest it and have Congress investigate.
[00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:55.010]  Which is our right.
[00:35:55.010 --> 00:35:57.010]  So this is an annihilation of the First Amendment.
[00:35:57.010 --> 00:35:58.010]  It's total election meddling.
[00:35:58.010 --> 00:36:02.010]  They're going after the sitting leader of the Republican Party,
[00:36:02.010 --> 00:36:06.010]  who's up to 70 points ahead in polls against all other candidates,
[00:36:06.010 --> 00:36:08.010]  20, 30 points ahead of Biden.
[00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:12.230]  The public's really waking up.
[00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:15.270]  And so they come in and say, you can't run.
[00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:16.270]  We're indicting you.
[00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:19.590]  And he says, that's election meddling.
[00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:21.870]  We have Biden saying, I'm not going to let Trump win.
[00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:23.350]  I'm not going to let Trump run.
[00:36:23.350 --> 00:36:27.790]  We'll use the constitution, meaning the law, law enforcement, that's a spin to do it.
[00:36:27.790 --> 00:36:31.310]  We'll play that clip in a moment.
[00:36:31.310 --> 00:36:34.870]  Clip two, first one we'll play.
[00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:41.110]  But see, they're saying, if they can get the head, which is Trump, they're then going
[00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:45.670]  to go down and say, well, just by questioning the election, that's illegal.
[00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:49.830]  We just indicted and then convicted Trump.
[00:36:49.830 --> 00:36:50.910]  That's their plan.
[00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:53.910]  And then set that precedent for everyone down the chain.
[00:36:53.970 --> 00:37:05.689]  And I was told this two years ago by high-level CIA sources that you said it is a full governmental
[00:37:05.689 --> 00:37:11.049]  order to outlaw basically the Trump Republican movement.
[00:37:11.049 --> 00:37:14.330]  And a lot of people are resigning their positions and are just totally freaked out and leaving
[00:37:14.330 --> 00:37:17.089]  the country because the plan is to set up a dictatorship.
[00:37:17.089 --> 00:37:20.290]  And I told you that two years ago.
[00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:27.290]  And these are people that have overthrown countries that were telling us this, okay?
[00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:33.330]  These are the Fletcher Prouty types that are still in government today.
[00:37:33.330 --> 00:37:38.649]  So you're getting it direct, just like I got it direct last week, and I told you here's
[00:37:38.649 --> 00:37:39.209]  a clip of it.
[00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:57.180]  It's Friday, July 28th, 2023 and we have exclusive information for you from multiple sources.
[00:37:57.180 --> 00:38:07.980]  Inside the pretty man, what's called main federal courthouse in DC, Jack Smith has indicted
[00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:13.340]  Trump with a puppet grand jury.
[00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:19.220]  You cannot get anything close to a fair trial in DC, that's well known, for January 6th
[00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:29.940]  for an array of charges and they have prepared the courthouse for his arraignment arrest
[00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:35.980]  as early as Monday, but the grand jury is in on Tuesdays and Thursdays, but they could
[00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:42.260]  come in any time and be there for the open certification of this.
[00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:49.140]  Of course, there was more charges filed today by the attack dog, Jack Smith, in the classified
[00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:55.860]  documents of witch hunt hoax, putting against a maintenance man for lying to federal agents
[00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:58.940]  saying he didn't particularly see boxes in one spot.
[00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:04.880]  Boy, that's what you get when you talk to the friendly FBI agents that are from a special
[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:09.160]  division of the Bureau, the same ones that ran the Whitmer kidnapping hoax in January
[00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:14.960]  6th and the Russia hoax, wouldn't get anywhere near those people and I sure as hell wouldn't
[00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:16.700]  talk to them.
[00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:21.000]  This is election stealing.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:31.120]  This is a live, ongoing, corrupt, multinational, globalist, corporate coup setting up the Justice
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:37.280]  Department as a permanent dictatorship and oligarchy over America and then I've got
[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:43.920]  all these newscasts, probably one of them yesterday, where they've got government PSYOP officers
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:50.520]  on TV saying, we need to start arresting the Trump supporters for their lies, their political
[00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:51.520]  views.
[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:57.760]  We need to come after them with homeland security and Mitt Romney agrees.
[00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:03.960]  I've talked to multiple sources inside the federal courthouse in DC and they say the
[00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:08.320]  indictments are already ready on a host of things surrounding January 6th and they've
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:13.080]  been told be ready as early as Monday for that announcement to happen and then sometime
[00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:19.280]  next week for the 45th president to turn himself in to this group of criminals and their kangaroo
[00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:20.280]  court.
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:28.360]  And then I went on to specifically say, my info is Dolan died on Tuesday, he'll turn
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:29.360]  himself in Thursday.
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:32.200]  That's now their plan to announce.
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:39.760]  So this is unprecedented and they're not going to stop here.
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:44.440]  This means they're going to steal every ongoing election, they'll leave a few ceremonial Republicans
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:48.240]  in that have an R before their name but serve the globalists so it has a little bit of an
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:52.320]  illusion for now, but they intend to fully just remove that.
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:56.800]  And the Democrats have said they want to outlaw the Republican party and just have a one party
[00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:57.800]  state.
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:02.200]  They'll have one that's communist and one that's communist light, but they'll all be
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:03.200]  the same communist.
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:06.680]  And I also talked about that on last week's show as well.
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:11.480]  A lot of folks don't like two parties, but three parties or four parties, parliamentary
[00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:13.960]  systems are very easy to rig and manipulate.
[00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:15.720]  The best system is a two party system.
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:18.040]  But when you have a one party, it's the worst.
[00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:21.960]  All right, we're going to go to break, I'm going to come back, go through the indictment
[00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:22.960]  and more.
[00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:23.960]  We do have some good news.
[00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:26.920]  Infowars is going to stay here as long as we can and stay on air.

[00:42:51.490 --> 00:42:54.490]  But now, I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:42:54.490 --> 00:42:58.490]  As we battle for the republic, we can't stop the globalists, but we've got to move now.
[00:42:58.490 --> 00:43:05.490]  Tell us about the products, how we support you, how we support all of ourselves, and the big event coming up.
[00:43:05.490 --> 00:43:09.490]  Well, yeah, let's, the first one, you obviously can go to MyPillow.com.
[00:43:09.490 --> 00:43:14.490]  Use that promo code, Alex, and you can get all these great discounts on all of our products.

[00:43:20.490 --> 00:43:29.490]  And there's the biggest special we have right now, the 20-year anniversary MyPillow for 1998 for the queen size, normally $69.98.
[00:43:29.490 --> 00:43:36.490]  We're celebrating our anniversary with what my employees love to invest, producing and making the MyPillow.
[00:43:36.490 --> 00:43:45.490]  And the model of businessmen and women with can-do know-how, using the money for Americana freedom to fight the globalists is what they fear.
[00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:48.490]  That's what the debanking is about. That's what the financial attacks are about.
[00:43:48.490 --> 00:43:56.490]  That's why we've got to rush to support MyPillow.com and InfoWars.com, plus their great products at both places, because we are the tip of the spear.
[00:44:04.490 --> 00:44:08.490]  I want to say BrainForce is great. I want to say TurboForce is amazing. It is.
[00:44:08.490 --> 00:44:12.490]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[00:44:12.490 --> 00:44:16.490]  The fish oil is better than it. And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[00:44:16.490 --> 00:44:21.490]  Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[00:44:21.490 --> 00:44:25.490]  Krill oil is the best, and it'll give you the damn burps, and I'm sorry.
[00:44:25.490 --> 00:44:27.490]  You want something like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[00:44:27.490 --> 00:44:30.490]  The krill is hallucinogenic, it's so good, in my view.
[00:44:30.490 --> 00:44:32.490]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[00:44:32.490 --> 00:44:35.490]  I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[00:44:35.490 --> 00:44:37.490]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[00:44:39.490 --> 00:44:43.490]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[00:44:46.490 --> 00:44:49.490]  So we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess,
[00:44:49.490 --> 00:44:53.490]  because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you. I just can't do it.
[00:44:58.490 --> 00:45:02.490]  I want to thank all of you over the years who have supported InfoWars financially
[00:45:02.490 --> 00:45:04.490]  and with word of mouth and prayer.
[00:45:04.490 --> 00:45:07.490]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists,
[00:45:07.490 --> 00:45:12.490]  and the fact that we're not caught flat-footed during their major takeover is because of you.
[00:45:12.490 --> 00:45:15.490]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.
[00:45:15.490 --> 00:45:18.490]  I just want to thank you all for buying products at InfoWarsStore.com,

[00:45:43.490 --> 00:45:47.490]  I want to encourage those of you out there that want to support freedom to take action now
[00:45:47.490 --> 00:45:52.490]  and be part of the global awakening, the new renaissance that's encountered the great reset,

[00:46:02.490 --> 00:46:05.490]  We got it back in stock, the amazing 30 parts per million,
[00:46:05.490 --> 00:46:09.490]  highest quality colloidal silver in all the great things and all the great uses,
[00:46:10.490 --> 00:46:14.490]  InfoWarsStore.com, 30% off.
[00:46:14.490 --> 00:46:19.490]  And it's a very limited supply, but we have it back.
[00:46:19.490 --> 00:46:23.490]  InfoWarsStore.com, Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver.
[00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:26.490]  The InfoWars Live Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver has returned.
[00:46:26.490 --> 00:46:32.490]  Silver Bullet is the answer to Alex's extensive search for a powerful colloidal silver product
[00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:37.490]  that utilizes high-quality processes to ensure for a truly unique product
[00:46:37.490 --> 00:46:40.490]  that has applications for both preparedness and regular use.
[00:46:40.490 --> 00:46:45.490]  It is amazing. It's got thousands of reviews, five-star reviews.
[00:46:45.490 --> 00:46:51.490]  InfoWarsStore.com, Silver Bullet returns to InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:46:51.490 --> 00:46:54.490]  And while you're there, get some super female vitality,
[00:46:54.490 --> 00:46:58.490]  some turbo force, some brain force, and some brain force ultra.
[00:46:58.950 --> 00:47:08.950]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:12:36.010 --> 01:12:42.010]  In a conspiracy to try to change it. Oh, I see.
[01:12:42.010 --> 01:12:49.010]  Each of these conspiracies, which built on the widespread mistrust the defendant was creating.
[01:12:49.010 --> 01:12:59.010]  Oh, so there's widespread mistrust because they don't trust you, but it's his fault through persuasive and destabilizing lies.
[01:12:59.010 --> 01:13:07.010]  So he's being indicted for lying, which he's not lying, but do you see the president trying to set it?
[01:13:07.010 --> 01:13:13.010]  And it goes on and on and on and on with his public statements and other statements.
[01:13:13.010 --> 01:13:19.010]  And then they have statements by some of his lawyers that we know were double agents saying they didn't agree with him.
[01:13:19.010 --> 01:13:23.010]  So, oh, look, one of his lawyers disagreed with him, but a bunch agreed.
[01:13:23.010 --> 01:13:29.010]  So we're going to indict the lawyers that agree with him and him. That's coming next.
[01:13:29.010 --> 01:13:34.010]  And the defendant's co-conspirators that lied with him.
[01:13:34.010 --> 01:13:39.010]  Do we have recordings of them in a meeting saying let's lie? No, they really thought there was fraud, which there was.
[01:13:39.010 --> 01:13:42.010]  Blocking out the windows at all the battleground states.
[01:13:42.010 --> 01:13:45.010]  Trucks being delivered with only Joe Biden ballots.
[01:13:45.010 --> 01:13:49.010]  Billionaire Trump way ahead. I'm saying, don't worry, it's a red mirage.
[01:13:49.010 --> 01:13:55.010]  All the anomalies, the ballots wouldn't work in the Republican jurisdictions in many states like Arizona.
[01:13:55.010 --> 01:13:59.010]  The names of dead people showing up, the illegals voting, I mean, it all came out.
[01:13:59.010 --> 01:14:04.010]  There's been but they just say, nope, no fraud.
[01:14:04.010 --> 01:14:09.010]  And it goes on and on and on, and they've got stuff in here about and then he claimed there were illegal aliens.
[01:14:09.010 --> 01:14:15.010]  I mean, it's just look at this one in another message intended for another United States senator.
[01:14:16.010 --> 01:14:22.010]  Co-conspirator one repeated knowingly false allegations.
[01:14:22.010 --> 01:14:25.010]  Of election fraud, the vote counts were certified.
[01:14:25.010 --> 01:14:32.010]  The states in Congress were incorrect of the governors who had certified knew they were incorrect.
[01:14:32.010 --> 01:14:37.010]  And that illegal immigrants had voted in substantial numbers in Arizona.
[01:14:37.010 --> 01:14:43.010]  And that Georgia gave you a number, which is sixty five thousand people who were underage voted.
[01:14:43.010 --> 01:14:50.010]  And it goes on to show, oh, my gosh, they said illegal aliens were voting.
[01:14:50.010 --> 01:14:57.010]  Anybody. Can type into a search engine.
[01:14:57.010 --> 01:15:05.010]  Democrat cities legalize. Migrants legalize noncitizens voting.
[01:15:05.010 --> 01:15:11.010]  So I guess they don't technically call them illegal aliens anymore. It's all definitional.
[01:15:11.010 --> 01:15:17.010]  And then the vote harvesting and the ballot harvesting and the names being called by Facebook.
[01:15:17.010 --> 01:15:24.010]  Of people that didn't live in the districts that voted and learned they voted but didn't vote and didn't even live in the state.
[01:15:24.010 --> 01:15:31.010]  And movies like. Two thousand mules and the rest of it, but just all of that disregarded.
[01:15:31.010 --> 01:15:36.010]  But even if Trump was wrong, he has a right to challenge it. What did Al Gore do?
[01:15:36.010 --> 01:15:40.010]  Well, the Democrats do when Trump won 2016, they tried to block it with electors and all this.
[01:15:40.010 --> 01:15:47.010]  So. So, again, how are they doing this? Because they're crazy frauds and they're out of control.
[01:15:47.010 --> 01:15:50.010]  They're like cornered rats. They know the people turn against them.
[01:15:50.010 --> 01:15:58.010]  So all they can do now is try to outlaw questioning elections so they can steal all the future elections.
[01:15:58.010 --> 01:16:05.010]  Tell us about the products, how we support you, how we support all of ourselves and the big event coming up.
[01:16:05.010 --> 01:16:09.010]  Well, yeah, that's the first one. You obviously can go to MyPillow dot com.

[01:16:23.010 --> 01:16:29.010]  MyPillow for nineteen ninety eight for the queen size, normally sixty nine ninety eight.
[01:16:29.010 --> 01:16:36.010]  We're celebrating our anniversary with what my employees love doing best, producing and making the MyPillow.
[01:16:36.010 --> 01:16:45.010]  And the model of businessmen and women with can do know how using the money for Americana freedom to fight the globalists is what they fear.
[01:16:45.010 --> 01:16:48.010]  That's what the debunking is about. That's what the financial attacks are about.
[01:16:48.010 --> 01:16:53.010]  That's why we've got a rush to support MyPillow dot com and Infowars dot com.
[01:16:53.010 --> 01:16:56.010]  Plus, they're great products in both places because we are the tip of the spear.

[01:19:14.010 --> 01:19:19.010]  The allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply is enough to sterilize you
[01:19:19.010 --> 01:19:23.010]  and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.

[01:28:06.020 --> 01:28:08.020]  Nothing is enough.
[01:28:12.020 --> 01:28:14.020]  Says Zelensky. It's unlimited.
[01:28:14.020 --> 01:28:16.020]  Roseanne Barr is coming up.

[01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:08.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:32.000]  From Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:42.000]  We are now at the halfway point of this hour.
[01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:48.000]  Roseanne Barr is our guest, joining us via Skype.
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:53.000]  And I wanted to get her take on the Hunter Biden situation and Trump and the January 6th situation,
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:56.000]  the ongoing live coup against our republic.
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:57.000]  It is wild.
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:01.000]  Roger Stone is going to be joining us next hour, as well as Owen Schreuer.
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:07.000]  Roseanne Barr, thank you so much for being with us during these very dark times for our republic and the world.
[01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:10.000]  Yeah, well, thank you for having me.
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:13.000]  I'm always thrilled to be with you, Alex.
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000]  You've got a lot to say, I know.
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000]  I've been watching your statements.
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000]  Break it down for us.
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:33.000]  Well, I think that Hunter Biden is, he's so symbolic.
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:36.000]  It's like so many levels of stuff.
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:40.000]  So basically, he's tortured.
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:51.000]  And, you know, he was put in a position to be, he's like the symptom bearer in all of dysfunctional families.
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000]  They have a symptom bearer.
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000]  And that's what I think he is for his family.
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:35:00.000]  And he was put in that position by his dad, you know, to be the bag man, right?
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:01.000]  Yes.
[01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:04.000]  And I think he was trained to be that way.
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:12.000]  Because, you know, if you look at, he's got that tattoo of China Lakes on his back like that monster drink does.
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:21.000]  It's the same tattoo, basically, of China Lakes, where they do those Bohemian Grove type things to kids.
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:24.000]  You know what I'm talking about, right, Alex?
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:29.000]  Oh, there's no doubt that the Bidens are part of trauma-based mind control and sexual, ritual sexual abuse.
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000]  And so I think that he suffered that.
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:40.000]  And I think that he also had trauma when his mom and sisters were killed in that car accident.
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:43.000]  And I think that he has suspicions about it.
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:48.000]  And you can just see that he is also, he's a drug addict.
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:52.000]  And, you know, drug addicts are in madness.
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:36:00.000]  And I think all of, whenever I watch him, like he's always, it's kind of like a drug addict wants to be stopped.
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:06.000]  You know, they want to be saved and they want somebody to stop them or help them.
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:11.000]  You know, that's why they go so far until they break, you know, and then they ask for help.
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:16.000]  But he keeps getting enabled instead because he's useful.
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:22.000]  And I think that all of America is being forced to enable his addiction.
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:28.000]  And because we're all addicted in America, addicted to drugs or screens.
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000]  And I say bullshit.
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000]  We're addicted to bullshit.
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:35.000]  We'd rather have bullshit than our daily bread.
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:43.000]  Well, I got to tell you, Roseanne, it's definitely paradoxical that he can commit all these crimes.
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000]  His father can commit all these crimes.
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000]  The deep state can commit all these crimes.
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:52.000]  And all these chefs can die at the Clinton's house and Obama's house while he's there and all the rest of it.
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000]  And there's no investigations, no nothing.
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:59.000]  And Biden brags on TV that, you know, he threatened to take a billion dollars away from Ukraine.
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:04.000]  And they kept investigating his son and he and Burisma, the natural gas company.
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:08.000]  And then now what do you make of this January 6th indictment of Trump?
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:11.000]  It actually says Trump falsely claimed illegal aliens voted.
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:16.000]  They've arrested, indicted thousands in Georgia alone for the last election doing that.
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000]  I mean, this is crazy.
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:21.000]  What do you make of what's happening to Trump?
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:26.000]  Well, I think that, you know, there are two things going on if you look at it.
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:35.000]  If you read the Bible, you'll see that there were two magicians that tried to always mess with the Jewish people.
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000]  And one of them was named Bilak.
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:40.000]  And he kept on trying to put a curse out on the Jews.
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:44.000]  But he got mad because it kept on turning into a blessing.
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:51.000]  And, of course, by Jews, I mean people who, you know, back in the day it was people who were children of Abraham, right,
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:57.000]  who believed that there was one God and that he didn't require child sacrifice.
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:03.000]  Anyway, so, and I think that has a lot to do with everything.
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:10.000]  But now I've kind of lost my train of thought for where I was going.
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:11.000]  No, you were on Hunter Biden.
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:18.000]  And I mean, it's just a spectacle of them stumbling around everywhere, bombed out of their brains, saying they work for the Chinese.
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:22.000]  And then meanwhile, this wonderful president is being indicted.
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:27.000]  Yeah, they try to curse Trump by indicting him and impeaching him and all this stuff.
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:32.000]  But every time they end up exposing themselves and it hurts them.
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:35.000]  That was what I agree with you so far.
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:43.000]  But I think this indictment of Trump, which I was reading a lot, I got right on and started researching.
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:49.000]  It allows Trump to bring in discovery, which is what we all want.
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:57.000]  Because every court in this country has turned down anything that anybody's brought to that court to prove election fraud.
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:06.000]  But this indictment of Trump will allow Trump to bring up all the facts that have been buried by those Obama courts.
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:10.000]  And he's allowed to bring in discovery.
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:13.000]  So once again, I think it's going to boomerang on a big time.
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:20.000]  And I think that everything that Jack Smith has done is pretty much boomeranged on him.
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:23.000]  And they just like a bulldog to go after somebody and scare them.
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000]  They don't care if they win or lose.
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000]  I think that's the takeaway.
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:33.000]  They just like that you get attacked and shut up for a while and they unleash the next one after they lose.
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000]  And so that's what's going to happen.
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:48.000]  But I think this time Trump is going to introduce facts and discovery that were withheld in every other case where the people of the United States tried to question the election, which is a crime, of course.
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:55.000]  Well, Jack Smith didn't look too confident and too confident walking up to that podium yesterday.
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:59.000]  No, I think he's really terrified.
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.000]  And I think he's being forced to do it against his will.
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:03.000]  All you have to do is look at him.
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:09.000]  He's got the wide-eyed realtor Adam Schiff look, you know, that I always say.
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:12.000]  Just read some body language.
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:15.000]  Read Hunter Biden's body language.
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:18.000]  He is possessed by madness.
[01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:21.000]  And it's infected our whole country.
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:24.000]  Like he's so mad and so sick.
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000]  And it's infected our entire country.
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:36.000]  And people who are also involved in his scams, they're probably, I mean, they can't find whose coke it was in the White House.
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:46.000]  Okay, all of these scams, those same people are guilty for, you know, bringing in drugs over our border and letting that happen.
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:49.000]  It is so corrupt from bottom to top.
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:52.000]  And all they do is keep enabling Hunter.
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:55.000]  And I guess they don't want to help him.
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000]  They don't care whether he lives or dies.
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:00.000]  He's just, you know, the linchpin.
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:06.000]  I thought today we should pray for his soul because he could help a lot of people.
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:10.000]  He's caused so much irreparable damage that he has to answer for.
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:15.000]  But he looks to me like somebody who wants to unburden himself.
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:20.000]  And I do think that he turned in his own laptop because he couldn't take it anymore.
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:23.000]  And look at the stuff that's on that laptop.
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:24.000]  And they censor.
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:28.000]  I mean, he's on there having sex with the Obama's daughters.
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:29.000]  Have you seen that?
[01:41:30.450 --> 01:41:33.450]  You're absolutely right.
[01:41:33.450 --> 01:41:35.450]  The Deep State, I agree.
[01:41:35.450 --> 01:41:37.450]  The two impeachments, the Russiagate thing,
[01:41:37.450 --> 01:41:39.450]  that all blew up in their face, but they don't stop.
[01:41:39.450 --> 01:41:41.450]  Now they've got all these criminal indictments that are over the top.
[01:41:41.450 --> 01:41:43.450]  They've certainly tripled down here.
[01:41:43.450 --> 01:41:48.450]  What do you expect their next move is going to be?
[01:41:48.450 --> 01:41:53.450]  And I see this backfiring, but how do you see it backfiring?
[01:41:53.950 --> 01:42:22.950]  The backfire is that America wakes up from the madness that it's infected with before the, you know, and the fever breaks before it causes permanent brain damage. We're in a fever, and we have to break it. We have to wake up before we get permanent brain damage from this fever that is inflicted on us, just like everything else they inflicted on us by their lies.
[01:42:23.950 --> 01:42:48.950]  And their constant propaganda to hide the truth. We need the truth. And we're ready to hear it, too. I mean, I don't care how many sleepy people that people there are out there that are not ready for the truth. Good. Don't be ready then. Bring it out anyway. It's all there. It's all on that laptop. Him with little nine year old girls in lingerie. Are you kidding me? They're hiding that.
[01:42:48.950 --> 01:43:15.950]  And then they, you know, try to censor Sound of Freedom, which is about much the same thing. And it's all about drugs to drugs found in the White House. Are you kidding me? It's drugs, drugs, drugs over the border, killing people right and left in every family. Now every family has a drug addict. And I think that that's why they must be doing the same thing in their family with their drug addicted family members, just ignoring it till they die.
[01:43:15.950 --> 01:43:40.950]  I think somebody has to say stop. I think you said something really central here that I've meant to make the point more on air. When I sit back, I think really what's the big problem? America consumes more drugs. I forget the statistics didn't like the next hundred countries combined. It's some insane number like that. More prescription drugs, more illegal drugs, more alcohol. We are really right now a cursed, drugged out, insane nation. And nobody's more insane.
[01:43:40.950 --> 01:44:02.950]  And you know what? The leaders were also the number one consumers of child porn. And we are the hot, you know, us and the Ukraine are the hub of the organ and child sex trafficking centers in the world. Besides the obvious ones that nobody will name. But I mean, come on, people. Come on, people. Stop lying to you. By the way, we're just getting numb to it.
[01:44:02.950 --> 01:44:18.950]  It gives you brain damage. The international group last week dug up a big mass grave that Ukrainians put people in in Russian areas. They took and they found hundreds of dead babies with their organs cut out. That's confirmed. And that's just a blip in the news. One grave.
[01:44:18.950 --> 01:44:46.950]  I know. And it's been going on for so long, for so very long. And you know, every time it rears its head to inform the American people of where their tax money is going, you know, they just go to sleep harder and watch more TV and more video games. You are going to be held accountable for what you've allowed and the bullshit you've swallowed. It's all it's you're going to vomit it all back up and have to sit there with it. You better wake up.
[01:44:47.950 --> 01:45:08.950]  And now look what they're doing. Look what they're doing. I mean, you can't walk down the street without making the mental note that most of the people on the street who are homeless are black Americans. So stop. Stop with all your bullshit. And then, you know, stop it. Stop voting for that party that's doing that to you.
[01:45:08.950 --> 01:45:32.950]  I've tried to sound that alarm for so long and of course called a racist for it. But I mean, my God, they have every single community under such heavy mind control that they can't even realize the fact that they're free. You're not in slavery. You Jewish people are voting for the Democrats. They just started BDS against all the Jews in Israel and America.
[01:45:32.950 --> 01:45:56.950]  You're not slaves. You're free in America. And you're helping them take that away from us. What is wrong with you? Wake up. Stop eating bullshit. God, it makes me so mad. All I can do is just say I just have to center and pray for souls. You know, I know I swear and everything like that, Alex, but I get too passionate.
[01:45:57.950 --> 01:46:20.950]  I want to pray for the soul of Hunter Biden. He looks like he's in agony. He looks like he's in madness. He looks like he cannot scratch that itch that comes from soul death, and he can't. But you know what? He could unburden himself. He could help stop it. He could tell all that he knows. He could help stop it.
[01:46:20.950 --> 01:46:44.950]  And he could clear his conscience before he meets his maker in those last seconds when he dies. He could go with a clear conscience. And whatever there is left of his soul, and you can see it's in there on fire in every picture I see of his eyes. I just pray for you, Hunter, that you could realize that you could do the right thing right now.
[01:46:45.950 --> 01:47:08.950]  You could get healed right now by telling the truth and doing the right thing and helping to ensure that this stops everything that you were part of, everything that you suffered in your life. You don't have to help that continue. I think you don't want to. And you could come back to the human beings. You could come back to the human beings.
[01:47:09.950 --> 01:47:35.950]  Well, I mean, clearly the Bible says, pray for our enemies. But I think, Hunter, I'm not judging you, but I think he's far beyond gone. But let's talk about the abuse. Canada trans person requests euthanasia due to pain and complications after sex surgery. And it continues. Trans doctor for euthanasia denial. So they'll kill a child that's, quote, depressed in Canada, but won't let somebody they've mutilated kill themselves.
[01:47:35.950 --> 01:47:49.950]  Can't endure brutal pain from surgical built vagina, which don't work. They cut the penis off, create a big giant hole that never heals. You've got to keep a device in. I mean, this is just beyond crazy.
[01:47:49.950 --> 01:48:15.950]  It's Nazi science. It's Nazi science, Alex. These are people are Nazis. You know, most of the all of the Nazis who committed the horrors were doctors. And look at they're all in bed with that kind of stuff. Eugenicists and stuff. They're doctors. They're they're academics. They're professionals and all that class of people. They're demonic. For God's sake, leave children alone. Leave them alone.
[01:48:16.950 --> 01:48:36.950]  Talk about demonic. I see this every day. Backlash erupts over Doc Martin shoe featuring transgender with mastectomy. How beautiful it is for women to cut their breast off. Here's another one. New boycott as UK coffee giant celebrates women having breasts removed. It's everywhere. I mean, you talk about totally demonic. This is it.
[01:48:37.950 --> 01:48:53.950]  Yeah, well, they hate women. They're so fearful and loathe loathing of women and they want to get rid of women's rights. That's why they can't define what a woman is, because then they don't have to talk about rape and they don't have to talk about child rape either.
[01:48:53.950 --> 01:49:09.950]  The next the thing they're really working on is to remove the age of consent. That's so tied up with all this stuff. At the base of it is the destruction of innocence. It's a satanic energy sucking that's taking place. But I agree with you. There's a global awakening happening. That's why they're panicking.
[01:49:10.950 --> 01:49:30.950]  Well, I just pray that Americans can, like, wake up to truth and not be so afraid of it and not scour Twitter for, you know, liars that they go. Oh, yeah, that makes sense. I'll repeat that. I'll parrot that. I mean, don't be afraid of the truth. It's staring you right in the face. And if you aren't going to face the truth, you're not going to make it.
[01:49:31.950 --> 01:49:45.950]  Going into this election, how do you see this unfolding with all these federal and state indictments, more to come? President Trump absolutely under attack because they want to go after the American people. That's why you're under attack. It's one of attack.
[01:49:45.950 --> 01:50:09.950]  Well, that's a true statement that Trump says, and it's totally true. They're trying to shut us down because they want to shut everybody down. And look at how they took your rant out of context and said that you were anti semitic when you were just being sarcastic and said you were. But notice they backed off of that real quick because people didn't buy it. Roseanne.
[01:50:10.950 --> 01:50:37.950]  I know. And I was so grateful and happy for that. I was like, man, that's just proof of our power. We can stop them because they're just strung along with a lot of words that end up to mean nothing. But we have the power of the people. People have the power. And, you know, all you have to do is just wake up and turn the light on. Don't be afraid of the truth. And just talk to other people who know more than you do. Stop calling them liars.
[01:50:37.950 --> 01:51:06.950]  Stop calling them crazy. Stop calling me crazy. I was right about everything I've said. And nobody ever goes, we're sorry, Roseanne, that we called you crazy when you said that, you know, like in my 1998 interview with Trump, I said, Trump, don't let your fellow billionaires turn America into a communist country. It's right there in 1998. And I've been out there alone for a long time, just being called crazy and a conspiracy theorist.
[01:51:08.950 --> 01:51:31.950]  When I ran for president in 2012, every single thing I said would happen has happened. It's a class war. And it's staged by fake leftists. I mean, talk about MKUltra. These fake socialists are working for billionaires to convince people to bring in socialism that is actually fascism. I mean, it's just classic mind control.
[01:51:32.950 --> 01:51:56.950]  It is. Let's shift gears. They said they want to make us wear masks again all over the news that COVID's back. Oh, it didn't come from Wuhan. We know it came from Wuhan. Now, this Chinese lab in California, 20 infectious agents, including COVID, hepatitis, chlamydia, are found in a lab injecting mice with disease operating.
[01:51:56.950 --> 01:52:08.950]  It is shut down after investigation found it was filled with hazardous materials, chemicals and medical waste. I mean, they've got these insane Dr. Frankenstein labs everywhere. It's crazy.
[01:52:09.950 --> 01:52:37.950]  Well, they do, because you know what, they're just all in bed with pharma and chemical companies. You know, they're just they're they're they're they're street gangs for chemicals and things that kill. They're getting paid to do that, to get those profits up. Just like the Nazis did with Zyklon B, they're getting paid to kill us. And they're using our own damn tax money to do it too, on top of it with, what's his name out there in California?
[01:52:37.950 --> 01:52:47.950]  Nancy Pelosi's nephew Newsome. Look at that. Look at he he didn't win that. They he they tried to recall him. Look what he did there.
[01:52:47.950 --> 01:53:08.950]  Well, let me show you some of the latest stuff. NBC News. What could it be? Mainstream media shocked by 30% increase in heart attack deaths among ages 25 to 44 saying, oh, it's COVID infant vaccine linked increase in all cause mortality. New research shows. I mean, it is coming out that they're killing us.
[01:53:09.950 --> 01:53:34.950]  And look at this Chinese tennis star, Yibing Wu, 23 collapses in scary city open scene. Broncos to cut KJ Hamler after wide receiver reveals heart condition. This is the Fox News. This is just today. Look what happened last week to LeBron James's son. Heart attack will never play again. They say it's COVID, even though it was triple vax. I mean, this is a Holocaust.
[01:53:34.950 --> 01:53:52.950]  This is them standardizing, normalizing, killing us and then covering it up. We've got Roger Stone and others coming up next hour. I'd love to get you back to studio for a full hour soon, but I'm glad we got you for limited time. Roseanne Barr dot com. Closing comment. You got about a minute and a half. Roseanne.
[01:53:53.950 --> 01:54:18.950]  Well, I just pray that that the light of intelligence from the creator will reach through this veil of BS to reach the souls and hearts of all of America, that they can wake up before it's just too late. And it almost is already. But, you know, this is the last second that it's possible for you to wake up so we don't lose everything that we have worked so hard to build.
[01:54:19.950 --> 01:54:29.950]  And I'm talking to all the people straight down Main Street, the middle of this country, every color, every class, everybody who cares about this country and freedom in the world.
[01:54:30.950 --> 01:54:39.950]  Beautifully said. Look forward to seeing you and the family. Maybe we should hook up again when you're doing a show with Joe Rogan like we did a while back and I'll get dinner together or something. Roseanne, thank you so much.
[01:54:40.950 --> 01:54:41.950]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[01:54:42.950 --> 01:54:51.950]  That's a good idea. Joe and I should take her out to dinner. OK, great lady. Very interesting, very informative and definitely been right and demonized for it, but now vindicated. All right. Roger Stone is coming up.

[01:58:18.950 --> 01:58:24.950]  We're celebrating our anniversary with what my employees love to invest, producing and making the MyPillow.
[01:58:25.950 --> 01:58:34.950]  And the model of businessmen and women with can-do know-how using the money for Americana freedom to fight the globalists is what they fear.
[01:58:34.950 --> 01:58:37.950]  That's what the debanking is about. That's what the financial attacks are about.

[01:59:48.950 --> 01:59:55.950]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's Alex Jones.
[01:59:58.950 --> 02:00:08.950]  If I was the deep state and I wanted to destroy America, I would rig the election with a puppet candidate. One that was so compromised that they would never say a word about it.
[02:00:09.950 --> 02:00:20.950]  I would create a false flag that allows for mail-in ballots. I would be in charge of the ballot counting machines. I would create a false flag to blame all who question the results of the election.
[02:00:21.950 --> 02:00:30.950]  If I was the deep state, I would prosecute anyone that went against me. I would sue and prosecute anyone that spoke up about the fraudulent election.
[02:00:31.950 --> 02:00:42.950]  I would use my powers to shut down all your internet businesses and bankrupt you. If I was the deep state, I would make everyone an example why you should never question a Democrat ever winning an election.
[02:00:42.950 --> 02:00:58.950]  I would imprison my foes. I would use my corrupt DAs and blackmail judges to destroy you. I would make sure all crimes I ever committed never happened. I would prosecute my biggest competition. I would make sure they could never run for office ever again.
[02:00:59.950 --> 02:01:00.950]  Trump knows he's an illegitimate president.
[02:01:01.950 --> 02:01:03.950]  The president-elect, although legally elected, is not legitimate.
[02:01:04.950 --> 02:01:08.950]  I don't see this president-elect as a legitimate president.
[02:01:08.950 --> 02:01:12.950]  You said you believe that Russia's interference altered the outcome of the election.
[02:01:13.950 --> 02:01:14.950]  I do.
[02:01:15.950 --> 02:01:21.950]  We have a president who, if in fact it is proven, has been assisted by the Russians and may in fact not be a legitimate president.
[02:01:22.950 --> 02:01:31.950]  The one thing that Trump is fearful of when it comes to his being president is that finally we will see how illegitimate his victory actually was.
[02:01:32.950 --> 02:01:33.950]  I have an objection.
[02:01:34.950 --> 02:01:35.950]  I object to the 15 votes from the state of North Carolina.
[02:01:36.950 --> 02:01:37.950]  I object because people are horrified.
[02:01:38.950 --> 02:01:39.950]  Trump is an illegitimate president.
[02:01:40.950 --> 02:01:41.950]  Do you believe Trump is a legitimate president?
[02:01:42.950 --> 02:01:46.950]  What I believe is that there's no question that the outcome of this election was affected by the Russian interference.
[02:01:47.950 --> 02:01:49.950]  There absolutely is a cloud of illegitimacy.
[02:01:50.950 --> 02:01:51.950]  So that legitimacy is in question, yes.
[02:01:52.950 --> 02:01:55.950]  So that was a very tainted election and in that sense it's illegitimate.
[02:01:56.950 --> 02:02:00.950]  Why do you think the president is going to such great lengths to essentially prove that he beat you?
[02:02:01.950 --> 02:02:04.950]  Because he knows he didn't. He knows he's an illegitimate president.
[02:02:04.950 --> 02:02:09.950]  So of course he's obsessed with me and I believe that it's a guilty conscience.
[02:02:10.950 --> 02:02:14.950]  We actually won the last presidential election, folks. They stole the last presidential election.
[02:02:15.950 --> 02:02:17.950]  If Al Gore won that election, I think he won it anyway.
[02:02:18.950 --> 02:02:19.950]  Actually, I think I carried Florida.
[02:02:20.950 --> 02:02:25.950]  Bush versus Gore. A court took away a presidency.
[02:02:26.950 --> 02:02:30.950]  If all the votes were counted in Florida, that Al Gore would be president today and George Bush would be backing off.
[02:02:31.950 --> 02:02:38.950]  I come from Florida where you and others participated in what I call the United States coup d'etat.
[02:02:39.950 --> 02:02:41.950]  There's no doubt in my mind that Al Gore was elected president.
[02:02:42.950 --> 02:02:45.950]  I rise to object to the fraudulent 25 Florida electoral votes.
[02:02:46.950 --> 02:02:53.950]  I must object because of the overwhelming evidence of official misconduct, delivery fraud and an attempt to suppress voter turnout.
[02:02:54.950 --> 02:03:02.950]  It is signed by myself on behalf of my diverse constituents and the millions of Americans who have been disenfranchised by Florida's inaccurate vote count.
[02:03:03.950 --> 02:03:06.950]  The Supreme Court, not the people of the United States, decided this election.
[02:03:07.950 --> 02:03:11.950]  Speaking to a Democratic group in Chicago Tuesday, he made it clear he thinks Al Gore was the winner.
[02:03:12.950 --> 02:03:20.950]  By the time it was over, our candidate had won the popular vote and the only way they could win the election was to stop the voting in Florida.
[02:03:20.950 --> 02:03:30.950]  Katherine Harris, Jeb Bush, Jim Baker and the Supreme Court had tampered with the results. Al Gore would be president.
[02:03:31.950 --> 02:03:37.950]  The Supreme Court selected George W. Bush as the president. He was not elected.
[02:03:38.950 --> 02:03:42.950]  There is overwhelming evidence that George W. Bush did not win this election.
[02:03:43.950 --> 02:03:53.950]  What I observed as a voter, as a citizen of Illinois four years ago were troubling evidence of the fact that not every vote was being counted.
[02:03:54.950 --> 02:04:02.950]  I don't think that George W. Bush won the election in 2000 against Al Gore because I think he probably lost Florida and also nationwide.
[02:04:03.950 --> 02:04:12.950]  Without voter suppression, Stacey Abrams would be the governor of Georgia. Andrew Gillum is the governor of Florida.
[02:04:13.950 --> 02:04:18.950]  You refuse to concede and say that you lost. Do you stand by that decision today?
[02:04:19.950 --> 02:04:21.950]  Absolutely. The election was not fair. The process was not fair.
[02:04:22.950 --> 02:04:25.950]  If Stacey Abrams doesn't win in Georgia, they stole it. It's clear. It's clear.
[02:04:26.950 --> 02:04:28.950]  I think that Stacey Abrams' election is being stolen from her.
[02:04:29.950 --> 02:04:30.950]  It was not a free and fair election.
[02:04:30.950 --> 02:04:35.950]  Brian Kemp stole the gubernatorial election from Georgians and Stacey Abrams.
[02:04:36.950 --> 02:04:43.950]  But will I say that this election was not tainted, was not a disinvestment and a disenfranchisement of thousands of voters? I will not say that.
[02:04:43.950 --> 02:05:02.950]  For everything the globalists hit us with, God through Mother Nature has given us the answer.
[02:05:03.950 --> 02:05:11.950]  I don't have to sell you on CBD oil, full spectrum CBD oil, the incredible things it does for your nerves, your brain, your entire physiological system.
[02:05:11.950 --> 02:05:15.950]  For your nervous system particularly. Everybody knows it's incredible it works.
[02:05:16.950 --> 02:05:20.950]  We have the strongest, best CBD oil you're going to find anywhere at the lowest price.
[02:05:21.950 --> 02:05:26.950]  Yes, you can find this same CBD oil for 30% more because that's who we're getting it from.
[02:05:27.950 --> 02:05:29.950]  Made right here in Central Texas.
[02:05:30.950 --> 02:05:33.950]  Our private label name is Rebel Zen.
[02:05:34.950 --> 02:05:38.950]  Rebel Zen is a private label of one of the top three or four CBD makers in the country.
[02:05:38.950 --> 02:05:42.950]  It's based right here in Texas and we're giving it to you at 30% off.
[02:05:43.950 --> 02:05:45.950]  And here's what's even crazier, 30% off of what they're selling it for.
[02:05:46.950 --> 02:05:48.950]  They're selling theirs for 30% off of what their competitors are.
[02:05:49.950 --> 02:05:53.950]  So this is the highest rated, already at the lowest price, now even a lower price.
[02:05:54.950 --> 02:05:57.950]  Rebel Zen, get yours at InfoWareStore.com now.
[02:06:08.950 --> 02:06:12.950]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he. It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:13.950 --> 02:06:16.950]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:06:28.950 --> 02:06:36.950]  We've got Roger Stone joining us at the bottom of the hour to respond to the Trump indictment.
[02:06:36.950 --> 02:06:43.950]  And a lot of the stuff that Alex has already covered today I was going to talk about, so I won't be redundant here.
[02:06:44.950 --> 02:06:46.950]  With the Bidenomics that have totally failed.
[02:06:47.950 --> 02:06:54.950]  With the situation that Trump is going to be facing in these latest indictments.
[02:06:55.950 --> 02:06:58.950]  With the four counts that is really just a punishment for his free speech.
[02:06:59.950 --> 02:07:02.950]  And, of course, the double standard couldn't be more obvious.
[02:07:02.950 --> 02:07:09.950]  We just played for you a four minute video put together today by Darren McBreen of Democrats rejecting, denying election results.
[02:07:10.950 --> 02:07:13.950]  I've got another ten minute video of the same content.
[02:07:14.950 --> 02:07:17.950]  Ten minutes of Democrats denying and fighting the results.
[02:07:18.950 --> 02:07:19.950]  And there's more out there, too.
[02:07:20.950 --> 02:07:23.950]  There's more out there. You could play it all day long.
[02:07:24.950 --> 02:07:29.950]  So here's really the conundrum we are facing that couldn't be more obvious now.
[02:07:29.950 --> 02:07:30.950]  Couldn't be more obvious now.
[02:07:31.950 --> 02:07:36.950]  There is a ruling class. There is a ruling class. There is a political elite in this country.
[02:07:37.950 --> 02:07:40.950]  The rules are different for them. The standards are different for them.
[02:07:41.950 --> 02:07:47.950]  And whenever you or we the people, let's say, whenever we the people decide, hey, you know what, we don't like how things are going in D.C.
[02:07:48.950 --> 02:07:49.950]  We need to take things a different direction.
[02:07:50.950 --> 02:07:53.950]  They remind you, not so subtly, you don't get to do that.
[02:07:54.950 --> 02:07:58.950]  Oh, you want Donald Trump for president? No, you don't. Now we're going to arrest him.
[02:08:00.950 --> 02:08:02.950]  Of course, the Democrats.
[02:08:03.950 --> 02:08:09.950]  The Democrats have rejected every presidential election that they've lost in the 21st century.
[02:08:10.950 --> 02:08:12.950]  And now they're indicting Trump.
[02:08:13.950 --> 02:08:15.950]  When Trump actually has the evidence.
[02:08:16.950 --> 02:08:17.950]  Trump, it's actually obvious.
[02:08:18.950 --> 02:08:21.950]  Forty, fifty thousand people at a rally for Trump, Joe Biden gets ten.
[02:08:22.950 --> 02:08:24.950]  For an entire election cycle.
[02:08:25.950 --> 02:08:27.950]  When the numbers all panned out.
[02:08:28.950 --> 02:08:32.950]  Donald Trump had more than three million people attending his rallies.
[02:08:33.950 --> 02:08:34.950]  More than three million people.
[02:08:35.950 --> 02:08:37.950]  Joe Biden had about 30,000.
[02:08:39.950 --> 02:08:41.950]  Overall, all rallies combined.
[02:08:42.950 --> 02:08:44.950]  Three million plus to 30,000.
[02:08:47.950 --> 02:08:48.950]  We've got.
[02:08:49.950 --> 02:08:50.950]  We've got.
[02:08:51.950 --> 02:08:55.950]  The graphs from election night that are just the live election trackers.
[02:08:56.950 --> 02:08:59.950]  Where Joe Biden gets the vote, Viagra.
[02:09:00.950 --> 02:09:01.950]  I did a whole tour.
[02:09:02.950 --> 02:09:07.950]  Me and the crew went on a tour. It was like an 18 city tour in the Infowars battle tank.
[02:09:08.950 --> 02:09:11.950]  And I had five of these graphs, six of these graphs, just like this.
[02:09:12.950 --> 02:09:16.950]  That showed how in Michigan, Pennsylvania.
[02:09:16.950 --> 02:09:19.950]  Wisconsin, Georgia.
[02:09:21.950 --> 02:09:22.950]  Arizona.
[02:09:25.950 --> 02:09:29.950]  Trump is winning all day long.
[02:09:30.950 --> 02:09:36.950]  And then right at three o'clock in the morning, Joe Biden gets the vote, Viagra, and it goes straight up.
[02:09:37.950 --> 02:09:39.950]  Guys, dot cam this, because a lot of people probably haven't seen this.
[02:09:40.950 --> 02:09:43.950]  A lot of people in the audience today are probably new.
[02:09:43.950 --> 02:09:49.950]  A lot of people that are monitoring the news today maybe weren't as hyper vigilant back in 2020 when this happened.
[02:09:50.950 --> 02:09:51.950]  Here's your vote, Viagra.
[02:09:54.950 --> 02:09:55.950]  Straight up.
[02:09:57.950 --> 02:09:58.950]  They don't even hide it from you.
[02:10:01.950 --> 02:10:02.950]  Straight up.
[02:10:04.950 --> 02:10:07.950]  And that happened in five different states.
[02:10:08.950 --> 02:10:10.950]  And it was the five states that ultimately swung the election.
[02:10:10.950 --> 02:10:15.950]  And it was the five cities in those five states where they boarded up the poll watching areas.
[02:10:16.950 --> 02:10:18.950]  Where they lied about a water main break.
[02:10:21.950 --> 02:10:26.950]  Where they had witness testimony saying that they were fake mail-in ballots that were being counted.
[02:10:27.950 --> 02:10:34.950]  When they were pulling out huge bins of ballots from under the table and counting them all for Joe Biden.
[02:10:35.950 --> 02:10:44.950]  When delivery trucks are backing into the polling station at three in the morning delivering entire pallet loads of ballots for Joe Biden.
[02:10:45.950 --> 02:10:49.950]  We watched all of it.
[02:10:51.950 --> 02:10:56.950]  Never before seen, couldn't be more obvious, utterly ridiculous, total corruption.
[02:10:57.950 --> 02:11:02.950]  Imagine if the Democrats had any evidence like that when they denied that Bush won twice.
[02:11:03.950 --> 02:11:08.950]  Imagine if Democrats had any evidence like that when they denied that Trump won in 2016.
[02:11:10.950 --> 02:11:11.950]  Can you imagine?
[02:11:12.950 --> 02:11:15.950]  Do you think they would have rallied? Do you think they would have rioted?
[02:11:17.950 --> 02:11:23.950]  But what's the ultimate, what's the ultimate realization?
[02:11:24.950 --> 02:11:26.950]  What is the ultimate most dangerous thing to say right now?
[02:11:29.950 --> 02:11:31.950]  Of course they're scared of Donald Trump.
[02:11:33.950 --> 02:11:37.950]  I mean you can see it when Jack Smith gets up there and talks.
[02:11:38.950 --> 02:11:40.950]  He looks like a frightened little chicken.
[02:11:41.950 --> 02:11:43.950]  He looks like a frightened little chicken shit.
[02:11:47.950 --> 02:11:50.950]  Because his masters, his controllers are making him do all this for whatever reason.
[02:11:51.950 --> 02:11:52.950]  Maybe he's blackmailed, maybe he's in on it.
[02:11:53.950 --> 02:11:54.950]  Maybe he really is just a radical leftist.
[02:11:56.950 --> 02:12:00.950]  With his wife who donates to Joe Biden, works for Barack Obama.
[02:12:00.950 --> 02:12:03.950]  Yeah, yeah, that's his wife.
[02:12:04.950 --> 02:12:08.950]  He shouldn't, he shouldn't have any bias though, right?
[02:12:09.950 --> 02:12:11.950]  No reason to recuse himself.
[02:12:14.950 --> 02:12:21.950]  No folks, for the first time ever in my life and your life, most likely,
[02:12:22.950 --> 02:12:27.950]  American patriots who understand the corruption in D.C. more than ever,
[02:12:27.950 --> 02:12:29.950]  are fed up with it more than ever.
[02:12:30.950 --> 02:12:34.950]  Our way of life, our prosperity, our future slipping out of our hands.
[02:12:35.950 --> 02:12:38.950]  And if we don't even have legitimate elections to try to get it back in the right direction,
[02:12:39.950 --> 02:12:40.950]  then we have nothing.
[02:12:41.950 --> 02:12:45.950]  Because the same people that steal elections are the same people that censor your free speech
[02:12:46.950 --> 02:12:47.950]  and now want to criminalize it.
[02:12:48.950 --> 02:12:51.950]  The same people that steal elections are the same people that want to take your firearms.
[02:12:52.950 --> 02:12:56.950]  The same people that steal elections are the same people that want to take your household appliances
[02:12:57.950 --> 02:13:00.950]  your gas powered vehicles.
[02:13:01.950 --> 02:13:02.950]  It's the same people.
[02:13:03.950 --> 02:13:08.950]  And the fact that we had one, more than one million people in Washington, D.C.,
[02:13:09.950 --> 02:13:12.950]  that's what freaks them out the most.
[02:13:14.950 --> 02:13:15.950]  That's what scares them the most.
[02:13:16.950 --> 02:13:19.950]  They need to make sure that we the people of this country can never organize,
[02:13:20.950 --> 02:13:26.950]  never activate, never coalesce, and certainly never come together as a group of one million plus.
[02:13:28.950 --> 02:13:35.950]  Look at how fearful they are of your peaceful First Amendment activity.
[02:13:36.950 --> 02:13:37.950]  That's what this is all about.
[02:13:38.950 --> 02:13:42.950]  Sure, they don't want Donald Trump in there, but even Donald Trump can be coerced.
[02:13:43.950 --> 02:13:44.950]  Even Donald Trump can be tricked.
[02:13:45.950 --> 02:13:46.950]  We saw that.
[02:13:47.950 --> 02:13:48.950]  Maybe he's learned his lesson.
[02:13:49.950 --> 02:13:50.950]  No.
[02:13:51.950 --> 02:13:53.950]  One and a half million people in Washington, D.C.,
[02:13:53.950 --> 02:13:57.950]  waving American flags, chanting USA, caring about this country,
[02:13:58.950 --> 02:13:59.950]  that is the ultimate crime.
[02:14:00.950 --> 02:14:04.950]  And the fact that Donald Trump would have led that movement
[02:14:05.950 --> 02:14:13.950]  means he must ceremoniously have his head chopped off and held above for all to see by the deep state.
[02:14:17.950 --> 02:14:18.950]  But I got to give it to Donald Trump.
[02:14:18.950 --> 02:14:26.950]  He made this statement last night after the indictment news dropped.
[02:14:30.950 --> 02:14:33.950]  But even after everything the deep state has done to me,
[02:14:34.950 --> 02:14:35.950]  I will never give up on America.
[02:14:36.950 --> 02:14:37.950]  Mark my words.
[02:14:38.950 --> 02:14:40.950]  In 2024, we will win back the White House.
[02:14:41.950 --> 02:14:42.950]  We will make America great again.
[02:14:43.950 --> 02:14:44.950]  I have no doubt about it.
[02:14:45.950 --> 02:14:46.950]  They come at me from left.
[02:14:46.950 --> 02:14:47.950]  They come at me from right.
[02:14:48.950 --> 02:14:52.950]  The rhinos, the communists, the Marxists, the fascists.
[02:14:53.950 --> 02:14:55.950]  We will not only survive.
[02:14:56.950 --> 02:14:58.950]  We will be stronger than ever before.
[02:14:59.950 --> 02:15:02.950]  We're fighting a fight like nobody ever thought possible.
[02:15:03.950 --> 02:15:04.950]  And we're winning.
[02:15:05.950 --> 02:15:06.950]  We won in 2016.
[02:15:07.950 --> 02:15:11.950]  We had a rigged election in 2020, but got more votes than any sitting president.
[02:15:12.950 --> 02:15:14.950]  We're going to win like never before.
[02:15:14.950 --> 02:15:17.950]  And we're going to make America great again.
[02:15:18.950 --> 02:15:22.950]  I can truly say I believe better than ever before.
[02:15:23.950 --> 02:15:26.950]  Thank you for all of your support and for all of your prayers.
[02:15:27.950 --> 02:15:29.950]  Yeah, you got my support, Donald Trump.
[02:15:30.950 --> 02:15:31.950]  Abso-frickin-lutely.
[02:15:32.950 --> 02:15:41.950]  And a lot of people probably can't even comprehend the epicness of that 60-second message from Donald Trump.
[02:15:42.950 --> 02:15:45.950]  But we at Infowars can.
[02:15:46.950 --> 02:15:47.950]  Because we've already been through it.
[02:15:48.950 --> 02:15:54.950]  And I can tell you what they're most likely going to do to Trump in his three cases, his three court cases next year as well.
[02:15:57.950 --> 02:16:02.950]  We finally have our original best-selling colloidal silver back in stock.
[02:16:03.950 --> 02:16:05.950]  With the supply chain breakdowns and all the problems in the economy,
[02:16:05.950 --> 02:16:11.950]  we could not get the highest quality colloidal silver for almost three years back in stock.
[02:16:12.950 --> 02:16:13.950]  But now we've got it.
[02:16:14.950 --> 02:16:15.950]  30 parts per million from the top lab.
[02:16:16.950 --> 02:16:17.950]  We've got a limited shipment.
[02:16:18.950 --> 02:16:19.950]  Hopefully we'll have a lot of it in the future.
[02:16:20.950 --> 02:16:25.950]  But if you want to experience and have in your medicine cabinet, have in your preparedness arsenal,
[02:16:26.950 --> 02:16:28.950]  high-quality colloidal silver from the best manufacturer,
[02:16:29.950 --> 02:16:34.950]  we have it right now private-labeled under the name Silver Bullet at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:16:35.950 --> 02:16:39.950]  Limited supply, 30% off, InfowarsStore.com, Silver Bullet.
[02:16:40.950 --> 02:16:43.950]  Research colloidal silver, find out what a game-changer it is,
[02:16:44.950 --> 02:16:46.950]  and then get yours at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:16:47.950 --> 02:16:51.950]  Silver Bullet, back in stock, 30% off, InfowarsStore.com.
[02:17:06.950 --> 02:17:10.950]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[02:17:11.950 --> 02:17:12.950]  The fish oil's better than it.
[02:17:13.950 --> 02:17:14.950]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[02:17:15.950 --> 02:17:19.950]  Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[02:17:20.950 --> 02:17:22.950]  Krill oil is the best, and it'll give you the damn burps.
[02:17:23.950 --> 02:17:25.950]  And I'm just sorry, you want something like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[02:17:26.950 --> 02:17:28.950]  The krill is hallucinogenic, it's so good, in my view.
[02:17:29.950 --> 02:17:30.950]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[02:17:31.950 --> 02:17:33.950]  I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[02:17:33.950 --> 02:17:34.950]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[02:17:36.950 --> 02:17:41.950]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[02:17:44.950 --> 02:17:46.950]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess,
[02:17:47.950 --> 02:17:49.950]  because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[02:17:50.950 --> 02:17:51.950]  I just can't do it.
[02:17:52.950 --> 02:17:53.950]  InfowarsStore.com.
[02:17:56.950 --> 02:18:00.950]  A lot of people have asked me, why is Infowars Store and Infowars Life
[02:18:01.950 --> 02:18:02.950]  not at a probiotic for more than three years?
[02:18:03.950 --> 02:18:04.950]  The answer is simple.
[02:18:05.950 --> 02:18:06.950]  We only bring you the highest quality at the lowest prices.
[02:18:07.950 --> 02:18:11.950]  We had a top-maker, top-certified of probiotics for more than seven years.
[02:18:12.950 --> 02:18:13.950]  They got bought by a libtard company and said,
[02:18:14.950 --> 02:18:16.950]  we're not doing business with you, Mr. Jones, anymore.
[02:18:17.950 --> 02:18:22.950]  Finally, we got a probiotic just as good or better with a top lab that loves our show.
[02:18:23.950 --> 02:18:26.950]  We're able to private label it under Infowars MD as our probiotic formula.
[02:18:27.950 --> 02:18:30.950]  So, you can get a super high-quality probiotic for amazing gut health and more

[02:18:39.950 --> 02:18:41.950]  I think you're going to have an amazing effect, and it funds our entire operation.

[02:18:52.950 --> 02:18:55.950]  You're going to want to pay attention to what I'm about to say in the next 60 seconds.
[02:18:56.950 --> 02:19:00.950]  Two new incredible products are now available exclusively at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:19:01.950 --> 02:19:04.950]  They are both clones of national best-selling products
[02:19:05.950 --> 02:19:08.950]  from a major pharmaceutical-slash-supplement maker that are listeners and patriots
[02:19:09.950 --> 02:19:13.950]  that are allowing us to private label it at a lower price you'll find in stores.
[02:19:14.950 --> 02:19:17.950]  It's Joint Relief Max and Nutrix.
[02:19:17.950 --> 02:19:21.950]  Both of these have known, documented natural compounds to lower pain
[02:19:22.950 --> 02:19:25.950]  and to also make your nerves healthier,
[02:19:26.950 --> 02:19:30.950]  which is one of the major reasons nerves get irritated and are more inductive to pain.
[02:19:31.950 --> 02:19:33.950]  There's major research behind this all.
[02:19:34.950 --> 02:19:36.950]  You need to get Joint Relief Max from Infowars MD
[02:19:37.950 --> 02:19:39.950]  and Nerve Renew from Infowars MD
[02:19:40.950 --> 02:19:43.950]  exclusively at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:19:43.950 --> 02:19:45.950]  Introducing them both, 25% off.
[02:19:46.950 --> 02:19:49.950]  You'll find them exclusively at InfowarsStore.com and they fund our operation.
[02:20:06.620 --> 02:20:18.460]  I don't want to tell you why that Trump statement is so epic, and why it has me so fired up today.
[02:20:18.460 --> 02:20:23.460]  Despite the darkness we're going through, it makes me want to charge through it even
[02:20:23.460 --> 02:20:25.460]  more hardcore.
[02:20:25.460 --> 02:20:31.780]  And I'm also going to tell you, most likely, what's going to happen to Donald Trump.
[02:20:31.780 --> 02:20:36.540]  As of right now, he's going to be in court with the three different indictments.
[02:20:36.540 --> 02:20:39.320]  Two of the dates have already been set, so it looks like he's going to be in court twice
[02:20:39.320 --> 02:20:41.460]  in the spring and once in the summer.
[02:20:41.460 --> 02:20:44.580]  This is all during the election year, when he should be campaigning, and he will be,
[02:20:44.580 --> 02:20:48.460]  and he'll be getting 30,000, 40,000 people at each rally, and then Joe Biden, or whoever
[02:20:48.460 --> 02:20:50.860]  the Democrat nominee is, might get a couple hundred.
[02:20:50.860 --> 02:20:55.380]  And then they'll magically get 90 million votes, or whatever Trump got, plus one million.
[02:20:55.380 --> 02:21:02.940]  So I'm going to explain all that, but there's been a revelation in one of the Hunter Biden
[02:21:02.940 --> 02:21:10.060]  cases that, with the confusion, why did Hunter Biden, or why did his attorneys believe that
[02:21:10.060 --> 02:21:14.540]  the FARA investigation that Hunter Biden is under, illegally acting as a foreign agent,
[02:21:14.540 --> 02:21:20.580]  not registered, Joe Biden as well, and so, see, but this is why it's important, because
[02:21:20.580 --> 02:21:24.660]  once you get down to where the money was going from Hunter Biden, it was going to Joe Biden.
[02:21:24.660 --> 02:21:29.140]  And then if you get Joe Biden, well, then you got Barack Obama, and that's the darling
[02:21:29.140 --> 02:21:32.240]  of the Democrat Party, so that's a big problem.
[02:21:32.240 --> 02:21:35.580]  So a lot of this protection of Biden is really protection of Obama.
[02:21:35.580 --> 02:21:38.820]  So if you're a little confused, why would they protect Biden so much, how could he have
[02:21:38.820 --> 02:21:39.820]  so much pull?
[02:21:39.820 --> 02:21:41.860]  Well, it's to protect Obama.
[02:21:41.860 --> 02:21:43.660]  Obama's the one running Biden.
[02:21:43.660 --> 02:21:48.140]  Obama's the one that greenlit Biden to do all this, and knew it was going on, not to mention
[02:21:48.140 --> 02:21:50.860]  Spygate, but that's a separate story.
[02:21:50.860 --> 02:21:58.420]  So there's a paragraph, it just hit the docket in Delaware, that basically part of the plea
[02:21:58.420 --> 02:22:05.840]  said, from the Department of Justice, that this plea agreement, there was confusion in
[02:22:05.840 --> 02:22:10.980]  the original, this plea agreement was supposed to give him immunity on future charges.
[02:22:10.980 --> 02:22:17.380]  Now they've filed a new plea, I suppose, where they're not going to give him those
[02:22:17.380 --> 02:22:18.840]  future protections.
[02:22:18.840 --> 02:22:27.320]  But basically, that was the DOJ working with the Biden legal team to say, we're going
[02:22:27.320 --> 02:22:29.040]  to pardon you, essentially.
[02:22:29.040 --> 02:22:34.200]  We're going to make sure that whatever is revealed in the FARA investigation, you won't be charged
[02:22:34.200 --> 02:22:35.200]  for it.
[02:22:35.200 --> 02:22:40.480]  I mean, that's essentially the DOJ, Merrick Garland, acting as the president, giving a
[02:22:40.480 --> 02:22:45.240]  pardon to Hunter Biden, when the case wasn't even concluded yet.
[02:22:45.240 --> 02:22:48.360]  And the judge saw it and said, what the hell?
[02:22:48.360 --> 02:22:49.360]  What?
[02:22:49.360 --> 02:22:54.200]  I can't, no, I'm not signing off on this.
[02:22:54.200 --> 02:23:03.160]  Now, as it has been now for the third time, a big break in the Biden crime family investigation,
[02:23:03.160 --> 02:23:04.520]  next day Trump gets indicted.
[02:23:04.520 --> 02:23:09.100]  So there might be two more of these phenomenons before this year even concludes.
[02:23:09.100 --> 02:23:12.760]  How many court cases is Trump going to have to be in court to defend himself with next
[02:23:12.760 --> 02:23:14.160]  year?
[02:23:14.160 --> 02:23:19.280]  Why did that statement from Donald Trump get me fired up?
[02:23:19.280 --> 02:23:20.800]  And maybe I should play it one more time.
[02:23:20.800 --> 02:23:23.120]  In fact, let's just play it one more time.
[02:23:23.120 --> 02:23:27.800]  Why does this statement from Donald Trump last night after the indictment?
[02:23:27.800 --> 02:23:31.040]  Why does this statement have me fired up?
[02:23:31.040 --> 02:23:35.480]  The country is in a very dark place right now.
[02:23:35.480 --> 02:23:40.880]  But even after everything the deep state has done to me, I will never give up on America.
[02:23:40.880 --> 02:23:41.880]  Mark my words.
[02:23:41.880 --> 02:23:45.680]  In 2024, we will win back the White House.
[02:23:45.680 --> 02:23:48.000]  We will make America great again.
[02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:49.980]  I have no doubt about it.
[02:23:49.980 --> 02:23:51.600]  They come at me from left.
[02:23:51.600 --> 02:23:53.880]  They come at me from right.
[02:23:53.880 --> 02:23:58.440]  The rhinos, the communists, the Marxists, the fascists.
[02:23:58.440 --> 02:24:04.480]  We will not only survive, we will be stronger than ever before.
[02:24:04.480 --> 02:24:08.040]  We're fighting a fight like nobody ever thought possible.
[02:24:08.040 --> 02:24:09.360]  And we're winning.
[02:24:09.360 --> 02:24:11.260]  We won in 2016.
[02:24:11.260 --> 02:24:16.820]  We had a rigged election in 2020, but got more votes than any sitting president.
[02:24:16.820 --> 02:24:19.780]  We're going to win like never before.
[02:24:19.780 --> 02:24:22.860]  And we're going to make America great again.
[02:24:22.860 --> 02:24:27.620]  I can truly say I believe better than ever before.
[02:24:27.620 --> 02:24:32.300]  Thank you for all of your support and for all of your prayers.
[02:24:32.300 --> 02:24:36.060]  Why does that statement have me so fired up?
[02:24:36.060 --> 02:24:43.700]  Because ladies and gentlemen, let me just tell you from experience psychologically, mentally,
[02:24:43.700 --> 02:24:53.140]  the toughest part of going through lawfare persecution like this that Donald Trump is
[02:24:53.140 --> 02:24:58.740]  going through is normally the first 24 hours.
[02:24:58.740 --> 02:25:03.380]  And it's very deflating.
[02:25:03.380 --> 02:25:08.220]  And you know, I mean, we could sit here and we could flex nuts all day and say, you know,
[02:25:08.220 --> 02:25:11.980]  if you've never been indicted or arrested or jailed or brought into court by these people,
[02:25:11.980 --> 02:25:14.980]  the enemies of America that run this country, then you aren't really in the fight.
[02:25:14.980 --> 02:25:17.340]  You're not really doing jack crap.
[02:25:17.340 --> 02:25:20.820]  But that's not even what this is about.
[02:25:20.820 --> 02:25:22.260]  We've been there.
[02:25:22.260 --> 02:25:28.140]  So for Donald Trump to come out and make that statement with the confidence and the positivity
[02:25:28.140 --> 02:25:29.140]  is so huge.
[02:25:29.140 --> 02:25:32.740]  I mean, this guy, this guy really does mean business.
[02:25:32.740 --> 02:25:33.940]  I'm not saying he's perfect.
[02:25:33.940 --> 02:25:37.980]  I'm not saying his first presidency was perfect, but they clearly do not want this guy back
[02:25:37.980 --> 02:25:40.060]  in the White House.
[02:25:40.060 --> 02:25:44.900]  And Donald Trump is really putting it all on the line because he cares about this country.
[02:25:44.900 --> 02:25:50.740]  And maybe it's for his own family, too, because he knows he's got grandkids that the country
[02:25:50.740 --> 02:25:53.500]  they're going to grow up in is going to be run by these screwball leftists and it's going
[02:25:53.500 --> 02:25:57.940]  to become a hellhole.
[02:25:57.940 --> 02:26:04.600]  But when I saw that, I said, damn, Donald Trump is the real deal.
[02:26:04.600 --> 02:26:06.180]  And I've already felt that way many times.
[02:26:06.180 --> 02:26:08.740]  It just reaffirmed it.
[02:26:08.740 --> 02:26:10.740]  And it just it just made me proud.
[02:26:10.740 --> 02:26:13.700]  I'm not going to lie.
[02:26:13.700 --> 02:26:15.980]  It made me proud.
[02:26:15.980 --> 02:26:19.300]  Because I understand why people have given up.
[02:26:19.300 --> 02:26:22.900]  I understand why people think Trump is controlled opposition.
[02:26:22.900 --> 02:26:25.100]  And at that point, you just really don't believe in anything.
[02:26:25.100 --> 02:26:26.820]  You kind of become a political nihilist.
[02:26:26.820 --> 02:26:28.500]  And I get it.
[02:26:28.500 --> 02:26:29.500]  I get it.
[02:26:29.500 --> 02:26:33.820]  But see, I know I'm real.
[02:26:33.820 --> 02:26:36.340]  I know that the people that work here are real.
[02:26:36.340 --> 02:26:39.020]  I know that the people I meet when I go to events are real.
[02:26:39.020 --> 02:26:42.580]  I know Roger Stone is real.
[02:26:42.580 --> 02:26:48.700]  So there are good people that care about this country that are putting it all on the line.
[02:26:48.700 --> 02:26:50.500]  I know that.
[02:26:50.500 --> 02:26:53.860]  And I believe Donald Trump is one of them.
[02:26:53.900 --> 02:26:59.260]  And when you see what he goes through and still he rises up and says, I believe in
[02:26:59.260 --> 02:27:00.260]  you.
[02:27:00.260 --> 02:27:01.260]  I believe in this country.
[02:27:01.260 --> 02:27:03.780]  I'm never going to give up.
[02:27:03.780 --> 02:27:08.700]  That says that is about as bad ass as it gets.
[02:27:08.700 --> 02:27:11.420]  Now this judge is an Obama appointee.
[02:27:11.420 --> 02:27:15.740]  This is the judge that Trump is going to have in these cases.
[02:27:15.740 --> 02:27:18.180]  So again, I've been through this.
[02:27:18.180 --> 02:27:20.740]  Alex has been through this.
[02:27:20.740 --> 02:27:24.260]  So we've got a little idea here.
[02:27:24.260 --> 02:27:31.220]  She's from Kingston, Jamaica, appointed by Barack Obama.
[02:27:31.220 --> 02:27:34.380]  I'm sure this isn't an affirmative action appointee, though, of course not.
[02:27:34.380 --> 02:27:39.020]  Not Tanya S. Chutkin.
[02:27:39.020 --> 02:27:42.740]  People are fired up today, and I'm seeing this all over the news, specifically conservative
[02:27:42.740 --> 02:27:46.940]  media that are saying when Trump gets into the courtroom, he's going to have discovery
[02:27:46.940 --> 02:27:48.620]  and subpoena power.
[02:27:48.620 --> 02:27:52.580]  And so the questions that he has about the election that they want to say is criminal
[02:27:52.580 --> 02:27:58.940]  for him to say he could subpoena and get discovery and maybe get some answers.
[02:27:58.940 --> 02:28:02.180]  That's funny that you believe that, because that's what would happen if it wasn't a rigged
[02:28:02.180 --> 02:28:03.180]  case.
[02:28:03.180 --> 02:28:08.940]  But let me tell you exactly what Judge Chutkin is going to do, just like what happened to
[02:28:08.940 --> 02:28:11.420]  Alex Jones.
[02:28:11.420 --> 02:28:14.300]  Donald Trump won't be allowed discovery.
[02:28:14.300 --> 02:28:17.620]  Donald Trump won't be allowed subpoena power.
[02:28:17.620 --> 02:28:20.540]  Donald Trump won't be allowed to present evidence.
[02:28:20.540 --> 02:28:24.620]  Donald Trump won't be allowed to show you pictures of graphs from that night with Biden
[02:28:24.620 --> 02:28:25.940]  getting the vote by Agra.
[02:28:25.940 --> 02:28:32.940]  Donald Trump won't be able to show clips from 3,000 mules, the documentary about the Biden
[02:28:32.940 --> 02:28:33.940]  vote mules.
[02:28:33.940 --> 02:28:38.900]  I mean, so, but it's going to be a process and it's going to be a good thing because
[02:28:38.900 --> 02:28:42.540]  all these true believers that still think, hey, we still live in America.
[02:28:42.540 --> 02:28:43.540]  We still have a system.
[02:28:43.540 --> 02:28:44.780]  It's not totally corrupt.
[02:28:44.780 --> 02:28:48.340]  They're all going to watch how corrupt it really is.
[02:28:48.340 --> 02:28:49.500]  They can't believe it.
[02:28:49.500 --> 02:28:54.660]  They haven't been following it at the front lines like we have, but now they're all going
[02:28:54.660 --> 02:28:57.540]  to get a nice big clue.
[02:28:57.540 --> 02:29:02.220]  Tell us about the products, how we support you, how we support all of ourselves and the
[02:29:02.220 --> 02:29:03.540]  big event coming up.
[02:29:03.540 --> 02:29:05.660]  Well, yeah, that's the first one.
[02:29:05.660 --> 02:29:10.700]  You obviously can go to MyPillow.com, use that promo code Alex, and you can get all
[02:29:10.700 --> 02:29:13.380]  these great discounts on all of our products.
[02:29:13.380 --> 02:29:19.100]  And just by visiting this site, you're going to get a $20 free gift emailed to you immediately.
[02:29:19.100 --> 02:29:23.380]  And there's the biggest special we have right now, the 20-year anniversary MyPillow for
[02:29:23.380 --> 02:29:27.980]  1998 for the queen size, normally $69.98.
[02:29:27.980 --> 02:29:33.020]  We're celebrating our anniversary with what my employees love to invest, producing and
[02:29:33.020 --> 02:29:34.780]  making the MyPillow.
[02:29:34.780 --> 02:29:41.900]  And the model of businessmen and women with can-do know-how, using the money for Americana
[02:29:41.900 --> 02:29:44.420]  freedom to fight the globalists is what they fear.
[02:29:44.420 --> 02:29:45.900]  That's what the debanking is about.
[02:29:45.900 --> 02:29:47.700]  That's what the financial attacks are about.
[02:29:47.700 --> 02:29:52.500]  That's why we've got to rush to support MyPillow.com and Infowars.com, plus their great products
[02:29:52.500 --> 02:29:58.260]  at both places, because we are the tip of the spear.
[02:29:58.260 --> 02:30:03.660]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food
[02:30:03.660 --> 02:30:05.020]  supply.
[02:30:05.020 --> 02:30:09.660]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which
[02:30:09.660 --> 02:30:13.860]  has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[02:30:13.860 --> 02:30:16.700]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[02:30:16.700 --> 02:30:20.020]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[02:30:20.020 --> 02:30:25.220]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally
[02:30:25.220 --> 02:30:28.500]  keep the soil rich with iodine.
[02:30:28.500 --> 02:30:34.620]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day, derived from ancient
[02:30:34.620 --> 02:30:38.940]  sea salts found thousands of feet below the earth's surface.
[02:30:38.940 --> 02:30:45.060]  Our Infowars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[02:30:45.060 --> 02:30:50.900]  Pure nascent iodine, stabilized in an activated triiodine form.

[02:31:20.580 --> 02:31:21.580]  silver.
[02:31:21.580 --> 02:31:25.460]  The Infowars Life silver bullet colloidal silver has returned.
[02:31:25.460 --> 02:31:31.500]  Silver bullet is the answer to Alex's extensive search for a powerful colloidal silver product
[02:31:31.500 --> 02:31:37.460]  that utilizes high quality processes to ensure for a truly unique product that has applications

[02:31:39.820 --> 02:31:41.580]  It is amazing.

[02:31:47.460 --> 02:31:51.020]  Silver bullet returns to InfowarsStore.com.

[02:31:58.820 --> 02:32:04.380]  I want to thank Alex Jones and Infowars for offering scholarships to River University.
[02:32:04.380 --> 02:32:09.820]  Maybe you're watching Infowars today, and you don't know what to do with the problems
[02:32:09.820 --> 02:32:11.900]  that we face in the world today.
[02:32:11.900 --> 02:32:16.500]  You've been through COVID-19, 2019, 2021, 22, 23.

[02:32:56.810 --> 02:33:08.810]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:08.810 --> 02:33:19.810]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[02:33:19.810 --> 02:33:24.810]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[02:33:24.810 --> 02:33:27.810]  Stuff is now breaking every hour on the hour.
[02:33:27.810 --> 02:33:34.810]  Tucker Carlson had a sit-down interview with Devin Archer that he has just posted.
[02:33:34.810 --> 02:33:37.810]  Tucker Carlson on Twitter.
[02:33:37.810 --> 02:33:40.810]  Wow.
[02:33:40.810 --> 02:33:43.810]  And then there's also some news out of Ukraine.
[02:33:43.810 --> 02:33:45.810]  That's not the focus of today.
[02:33:45.810 --> 02:33:51.810]  But the journalist over there that has been reporting the truth about what's going on from the ground,
[02:33:51.810 --> 02:33:58.810]  the Kiev regime, Zelensky has made sure to capture him, arrest him, and shut him up.
[02:33:58.810 --> 02:34:00.810]  That freedom-loving Zelensky.
[02:34:00.810 --> 02:34:02.810]  Amazing stuff.
[02:34:02.810 --> 02:34:05.810]  We're about to be joined by Roger Stone.
[02:34:05.810 --> 02:34:08.810]  It's great to be here on air with you today.
[02:34:08.810 --> 02:34:13.810]  And ladies and gentlemen, Vitamin Mineral Fusion, one of the most popular products at Infowarsstore.com,
[02:34:13.810 --> 02:34:16.810]  one of my favorite products, I start every day with Vitamin Mineral Fusion,
[02:34:16.810 --> 02:34:26.810]  is back in stock and 25% off right now at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:34:26.810 --> 02:34:28.810]  And it's your support there that keeps us on the air.
[02:34:28.810 --> 02:34:31.810]  But, folks, Vitamin Mineral Fusion sells out a lot.
[02:34:31.810 --> 02:34:33.810]  Sells out fast.
[02:34:33.810 --> 02:34:36.810]  So get your hands on it while the sale is live and while supplies last.
[02:34:36.810 --> 02:34:37.810]  All right.
[02:34:37.810 --> 02:34:38.810]  Well, this is great.
[02:34:38.810 --> 02:34:45.810]  Two days in a row now I've been privileged to have a conversation with Roger Stone right here on the Infowars War Rage.
[02:34:45.810 --> 02:34:47.810]  Now, airwaves.
[02:34:47.810 --> 02:34:51.810]  Now, Roger, last time we spoke, the latest indictment for Trump has not been filed.
[02:34:51.810 --> 02:34:54.810]  So it's a totally different world now, you might say.
[02:34:54.810 --> 02:34:59.810]  Now, have you heard, I'm just curious, did you hear President Trump's statement that he released last night,
[02:34:59.810 --> 02:35:01.810]  the video message that he released last night?
[02:35:01.810 --> 02:35:03.810]  Have you heard this yet?
[02:35:03.810 --> 02:35:06.810]  I read a transcript of his remarks.
[02:35:06.810 --> 02:35:08.810]  I haven't seen a video.
[02:35:08.810 --> 02:35:17.810]  But, actually, Owen, I think if you go back to the show we did last night, I predicted that we would be at this exact moment.
[02:35:17.810 --> 02:35:21.810]  In other words, we're, duh, in an information war.
[02:35:21.810 --> 02:35:29.810]  And, therefore, it became essential for the cabal, for the deep state Democrat media cabal,
[02:35:29.810 --> 02:35:35.810]  to blot out coverage of the epic corruption of the Biden crime family
[02:35:35.810 --> 02:35:44.810]  and the fact that we now have hard evidence of extortion, bribery, money laundering, influence peddling, illegal lobbying,
[02:35:44.810 --> 02:35:54.810]  and, let's just say it, treason by Joe Biden and Hunter Biden and Jim Biden and other august members of the Biden crime family.
[02:35:54.810 --> 02:35:57.810]  So they must immediately cue the indictments.
[02:35:57.810 --> 02:36:05.810]  I actually think it's possible, Owen, that the special counsel here has moved a little more quickly than he had planned.
[02:36:05.810 --> 02:36:12.810]  But that's because the House Republicans were able to expose as much as they have been able to expose.
[02:36:12.810 --> 02:36:16.810]  And, God forbid, that story lead the news.
[02:36:16.810 --> 02:36:18.810]  So what is the answer?
[02:36:18.810 --> 02:36:21.810]  The answer is to move very quickly on Donald Trump.
[02:36:21.810 --> 02:36:22.810]  Why?
[02:36:22.810 --> 02:36:29.810]  Well, because he's leading Joe Biden in the polls, because he's going to lengthen his lead against him in the polls.
[02:36:29.810 --> 02:36:38.810]  They have hit the panic button, and now they've completely weaponized the system, and they have triggered that weaponization.
[02:36:38.810 --> 02:36:40.810]  Let me put it another way.
[02:36:41.810 --> 02:36:50.810]  Questioning the outcome of an election, questioning the integrity of an election, is a crime for which you should actually go to prison,
[02:36:50.810 --> 02:37:02.810]  unless, of course, you're Hillary Clinton or Nancy Pelosi or Jerry Nadler or Stacey Abrams or Jamie Raskin, in which case it's perfectly all right.
[02:37:02.810 --> 02:37:04.810]  And you could go on for days with that list.
[02:37:04.810 --> 02:37:07.810]  Barbara Boxer, Kamala Harris.
[02:37:07.810 --> 02:37:10.810]  I mean, we could play this game all day long.
[02:37:10.810 --> 02:37:17.810]  But, you know, the judge in this case from Kingston, Jamaica, Tanya Chutkin, appointed by Barack Obama.
[02:37:17.810 --> 02:37:21.810]  I think we can all be confident, though, that this is not an affirmative action hire.
[02:37:21.810 --> 02:37:29.810]  I think we can all be confident here that this woman is not going to take into that courtroom any anti-white bigotry that she might have
[02:37:29.810 --> 02:37:35.810]  to get justice for her ancestors with that rich white man in her courtroom.
[02:37:35.810 --> 02:37:38.810]  I think we can all rest easy, Roger, knowing that's certainly not a potential here.
[02:37:38.810 --> 02:37:43.810]  Well, she's a major donor to Barack Obama.
[02:37:43.810 --> 02:37:51.810]  She and her husband, both major donors, and her mother-in-law, all major donors to Barack Obama.
[02:37:51.810 --> 02:37:53.810]  Must be nice. Must be nice, Roger.
[02:37:53.810 --> 02:37:56.810]  Oh, make some donations, get the judge position, huh?
[02:37:57.810 --> 02:38:04.810]  She and her husband, her husband's also appointed a federal judge by President Barack Obama.
[02:38:04.810 --> 02:38:11.810]  And, of course, she worked in the same law firm as Hunter Biden was associated with.
[02:38:11.810 --> 02:38:13.810]  But there's no political bias here.
[02:38:13.810 --> 02:38:16.810]  Look, I don't think it really mattered in D.C.
[02:38:16.810 --> 02:38:23.810]  I can't think of any member of the judiciary there that would be insulated from politics.
[02:38:23.810 --> 02:38:35.810]  But this judge has been particularly harsh on January 6th victims, has been particularly harsh on those charged with crimes in connection with January 6th,
[02:38:35.810 --> 02:38:41.810]  actually handing out sentences that were over and above those requested by prosecutors.
[02:38:41.810 --> 02:38:43.810]  Which is almost never the case.
[02:38:43.810 --> 02:38:46.810]  Very, very rarely the case.
[02:38:46.810 --> 02:38:49.810]  Look, this is a kill zone.
[02:38:49.810 --> 02:38:51.810]  I think we understand that.
[02:38:51.810 --> 02:39:02.810]  I don't think any Republican, put it another way, any non-Democrat, any non-liberal can get a fair trial in the District of Columbia.
[02:39:02.810 --> 02:39:06.810]  I think, and I'm not an attorney, and I say that right up front,
[02:39:06.810 --> 02:39:14.810]  but attorneys that I have talked to about these charges tell me that they believe that they are fatally flawed, that they're a stretch.
[02:39:14.810 --> 02:39:23.810]  That doesn't mean, unfortunately, that even if they put on the greatest defense in the world, and that's questionable at this point,
[02:39:23.810 --> 02:39:28.810]  and even if they relitigate whether the election was or was not stolen,
[02:39:28.810 --> 02:39:33.810]  which would take both a huge amount of time and a huge amount of money,
[02:39:33.810 --> 02:39:38.810]  the goal here is to stop Donald Trump from becoming president.
[02:39:38.810 --> 02:39:45.810]  If in the end some unjust conviction in the District of Columbia were to be overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court,
[02:39:45.810 --> 02:39:51.810]  but in the meantime, because of the timing of the trial and the dynamics of the election season,
[02:39:51.810 --> 02:39:57.810]  they were able to deny him returning to the White House, they will have achieved their goal.
[02:39:57.810 --> 02:40:08.810]  Now, if they can send him to prison for 600 years to serve as a lesson to anyone who might seek of challenging the broken two-party duopoly
[02:40:08.810 --> 02:40:14.810]  that is busy destroying our constitutional republic, then that would be good for them, too.
[02:40:14.810 --> 02:40:18.810]  I mean, they must be really scared of him. 600 years, Roger.
[02:40:18.810 --> 02:40:25.810]  For 600 years, this is like some sort of a mythical dragon that they have to use a spell to put away because they're so scared of this man.
[02:40:26.810 --> 02:40:34.810]  Well, I was kind of intrigued by the comments last night from the president's lawyer, John Loro,
[02:40:34.810 --> 02:40:41.810]  who is correct when he said that, look, when we tried to litigate the last election,
[02:40:41.810 --> 02:40:46.810]  when we tried to present evidence of election fraud, when we tried to make our case,
[02:40:46.810 --> 02:40:49.810]  the fundamental problem was that no court would ever hear it.
[02:40:49.810 --> 02:40:59.810]  Now, the left-wing mainstream jackals in the fake news media would try to imply, well, the judges, you know, the courts rejected your arguments.
[02:40:59.810 --> 02:41:03.810]  No, that's actually not true. It's not that they rejected the arguments.
[02:41:03.810 --> 02:41:07.810]  It's that they never would agree to hear the arguments.
[02:41:07.810 --> 02:41:14.810]  There's a case going on right now in Pennsylvania where, frankly, the Pennsylvania establishment,
[02:41:14.810 --> 02:41:19.810]  which I think did preside over a deeply flawed and, I think, corrupted election,
[02:41:19.810 --> 02:41:27.810]  is actually in retreat because Greg Stenstrom and Leah Hoopes, two patriots there,
[02:41:27.810 --> 02:41:37.810]  who are representing themselves, by the way, really are exposing the enormous fraud and, in fact, corruption of the entire system.
[02:41:37.810 --> 02:41:44.810]  So using that example, that case in Pennsylvania as a template,
[02:41:44.810 --> 02:41:52.810]  I do think it's possible here that the president and his lawyers and his supporters may have a chance, a canvas, as it were,
[02:41:52.810 --> 02:41:59.810]  to lay out the whole broader question of election fraud, something they never really had an opportunity to do previously.
[02:41:59.810 --> 02:42:06.810]  I agree that window is there, but I, and this comes from experience watching what they did to Alex Jones,
[02:42:06.810 --> 02:42:12.810]  I believe they'll shut that window, they'll lock that door, they'll make sure that nobody gets access to it.
[02:42:12.810 --> 02:42:15.810]  Trump can play the video clips of the Democrats denying elections.
[02:42:15.810 --> 02:42:19.810]  He can play the vote-viagra for Biden, 300,000 votes in the middle of the night,
[02:42:19.810 --> 02:42:24.810]  and they'll just say, nope, nope, reject, nope, you can't show that, nope, reject, nope, jury can't see that.
[02:42:24.810 --> 02:42:26.810]  That's what I think is going to happen, Roger.
[02:42:26.810 --> 02:42:33.810]  Well, that's entirely possible. Remember, prior to my trial, the judge ruled, based on a motion by the prosecutors,
[02:42:33.810 --> 02:42:37.810]  that we don't have to prove that there was any Russian collusion.
[02:42:37.810 --> 02:42:40.810]  Well, then, what was it that I theoretically lied about?
[02:42:40.810 --> 02:42:47.810]  In other words, in order to violate the False Statements Act, your false statement has to be both willful and material.
[02:42:47.810 --> 02:42:54.810]  If I had no motive to lie, because there is no Russian collusion or WikiLeaks collaboration to lie about...
[02:42:54.810 --> 02:42:57.810]  That's Roger Stone. We'll be right back.
[02:42:57.810 --> 02:43:05.810]  When hope and love has been lost, and you fall to the ground, you must find a way.
[02:43:05.810 --> 02:43:13.810]  When the darkness descends, and you're told it's the end, you must find a way.
[02:43:13.810 --> 02:43:19.810]  When God decides to look the other way, and a clown takes the throne, we must find a way.
[02:43:19.810 --> 02:43:21.810]  You will find a way.
[02:43:21.810 --> 02:43:24.810]  Dig down, and find faith.
[02:43:24.810 --> 02:43:32.810]  When you're close to the edge, with a gun to your head, you must find a way.
[02:43:32.810 --> 02:43:35.810]  We have entered the fray, and we will not obey.
[02:43:35.810 --> 02:43:40.810]  We must find a way, and find faith.
[02:43:44.810 --> 02:43:47.810]  We won't let them divide.
[02:43:47.810 --> 02:43:49.810]  We will never abide.
[02:43:49.810 --> 02:43:54.810]  We will find a way. Infowars.com

[02:58:14.400 --> 02:58:17.400]  for the queen size, normally $69.98.
[02:58:17.400 --> 02:58:24.400]  We're celebrating our anniversary with what my employees love doing best, producing and making the MyPillow.
[02:58:24.400 --> 02:58:29.400]  And the model of businessmen and women with can-do know-how,
[02:58:29.400 --> 02:58:34.400]  using the money for Americana freedom to fight the globalists is what they fear.
[02:58:34.400 --> 02:58:37.400]  That's what the debanking is about. That's what the financial attacks are about.
[02:58:37.400 --> 02:58:41.400]  That's why we've got to rush to support MyPillow.com and Infowars.com,
[02:58:41.400 --> 02:58:45.400]  plus their great products at both places, because we are the tip of the spear.
[02:58:47.400 --> 02:58:52.400]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[02:58:52.400 --> 02:58:55.400]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress,
[02:58:55.400 --> 02:59:01.400]  you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals needed daily.
[02:59:01.400 --> 02:59:06.400]  That's why Infowars Life created the powerful vitamin-mineral fusion formula,
[02:59:06.400 --> 02:59:10.400]  the new platinum standard of advanced multivitamin formulation.

[02:59:15.400 --> 02:59:18.400]  and give your body the tools it needs to support your body.

[02:59:50.400 --> 02:59:55.400]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:59:55.400 --> 03:00:05.400]  Vivek Ramaswamy, I think, is becoming the number two option in the Republican Party.
[03:00:05.400 --> 03:00:09.400]  I think eventually, consistently, we'll be passing DeSantis in the polls.
[03:00:09.400 --> 03:00:13.400]  Here was his statement last night in response to the Trump indictment.
[03:00:13.400 --> 03:00:16.400]  It's another sad moment in our country's history.
[03:00:16.400 --> 03:00:24.400]  The 45th President of the United States, Donald Trump, has yet again been indicted by the Biden DOJ,
[03:00:24.400 --> 03:00:31.400]  a political party in power that is now repeatedly using police force to indict and arrest
[03:00:31.400 --> 03:00:36.400]  and potentially eliminate its political opponents from competition.
[03:00:36.400 --> 03:00:38.400]  This is a politicized prosecution.
[03:00:38.400 --> 03:00:45.400]  It is a political persecution through prosecution now in a third indictment just in a matter of months
[03:00:45.400 --> 03:00:53.400]  against the person who is still at present the lead contender in the Republican primary for U.S. president.
[03:00:53.400 --> 03:00:55.400]  I want to be very clear.
[03:00:55.400 --> 03:00:59.400]  I am running for U.S. president in that same Republican primary.
[03:00:59.400 --> 03:01:04.400]  It would be easier for me if Donald Trump were eliminated from competition.
[03:01:04.400 --> 03:01:05.400]  That's not how I want to win.
[03:01:05.400 --> 03:01:07.400]  This is not about politics to me.
[03:01:07.400 --> 03:01:10.400]  This is about first principles.
[03:01:10.400 --> 03:01:18.400]  We do not want to become a country where the party in power is able to use banana republic-like tactics
[03:01:18.400 --> 03:01:20.400]  to eliminate its political opponents.
[03:01:20.400 --> 03:01:23.400]  Yet I'm sad to say that's exactly where we are.
[03:01:23.400 --> 03:01:26.400]  The allegations in this indictment fall flat.
[03:01:26.400 --> 03:01:35.400]  It is wrong and incorrect and inaccurate to place blame for what happened on January 6th at the feet of Donald Trump.
[03:01:35.400 --> 03:01:37.400]  I said this at the time.
[03:01:37.400 --> 03:01:39.400]  I've said it ever since then.
[03:01:39.400 --> 03:01:42.400]  I continue to say it today.
[03:01:42.400 --> 03:01:49.400]  I would not have made the same judgments that Donald Trump did in how he handled that day.
[03:01:49.400 --> 03:01:52.400]  But that's different from saying that he committed a crime.
[03:01:52.400 --> 03:01:54.400]  He did not.
[03:01:54.400 --> 03:01:59.400]  He specifically told the protesters that day to behave peacefully.
[03:01:59.400 --> 03:02:08.400]  The First Amendment in this country gives political protesters the ability to express themselves and their opinions freely.
[03:02:08.400 --> 03:02:14.400]  Donald Trump was not responsible for what happened on January 6th.
[03:02:14.400 --> 03:02:16.400]  You want to know what was responsible?
[03:02:16.400 --> 03:02:22.400]  I said this in the days after January 6th, 2021, just as I say it today.
[03:02:22.400 --> 03:02:27.400]  Systematic, pervasive censorship in this country.
[03:02:27.400 --> 03:02:35.400]  That was after a year where we had told people across this nation that you had to stay locked down in your house, in your basement,
[03:02:35.400 --> 03:02:37.400]  and shut up, sit down, do as you're told.
[03:02:37.400 --> 03:02:41.400]  If you question that, you're racist, you're anti-science.
[03:02:41.400 --> 03:02:43.400]  Your social media accounts were silenced.
[03:02:43.400 --> 03:02:48.400]  You had to stay home and locked down unless you were part of BLM or Antifa,
[03:02:48.400 --> 03:02:54.400]  in which case it was perfectly fine to roam the streets of this country and burn many of them down.
[03:02:54.400 --> 03:03:00.400]  That was the double standard that then applied and said that if you said the virus originated in a lab in Wuhan,
[03:03:00.400 --> 03:03:04.400]  you were again a racist and had your Internet accounts shut down.
[03:03:04.400 --> 03:03:11.400]  You were then told you had an election where you could express yourself to put the right person in charge of fixing these problems.
[03:03:11.400 --> 03:03:14.400]  And instead, your accounts were suppressed.
[03:03:14.400 --> 03:03:22.400]  If you sent a mere message saying that the Hunter Biden laptop stories from The New York Post was real, you had your accounts locked.
[03:03:22.400 --> 03:03:25.400]  Even The New York Post had its own account locked.
[03:03:25.400 --> 03:03:30.400]  And if you repeatedly then tell people they cannot speak, that is when they scream.
[03:03:30.400 --> 03:03:35.400]  If you repeatedly tell people they cannot scream, that is when they tear things down.
[03:03:35.400 --> 03:03:42.400]  I mean, I think we are making a grave mistake in this country by trying to pin the blame for that at the feet of one man.
[03:03:42.400 --> 03:03:51.400]  If we refuse to learn our mistakes from from our mistakes in the past, we are doomed to suffer an even worse fate in the future.
[03:03:51.400 --> 03:03:59.400]  I worry that will create a country where January 6, 2021 was a friendly parlay compared to what's actually to come.
[03:03:59.400 --> 03:04:05.400]  I'm running for president to make sure we don't march towards some kind of national divorce.
[03:04:05.400 --> 03:04:16.400]  But the first and most important step that we as candidates can take in this race is to speak and speak forcefully on the side of principle to say that even if we're competing against Donald Trump, as I am,
[03:04:16.400 --> 03:04:23.400]  I do not want to see him eliminated from competition using politicized tactics.
[03:04:23.400 --> 03:04:31.400]  Why hasn't Ron DeSantis made or released a statement similar to that when it would only help him in the polls?
[03:04:31.400 --> 03:04:35.400]  Because Ron DeSantis is controlled by the Republican Party establishment.
[03:04:35.400 --> 03:04:38.400]  He's in there to get Donald Trump out of their way.
[03:04:38.400 --> 03:04:43.400]  And he might be a good guy. He might have even at one point been a great presidential candidate.
[03:04:43.400 --> 03:04:51.400]  But you're not going to see a statement like that from Ron DeSantis because, well, the people that control him don't want to boost or uplift Donald Trump.
[03:04:51.400 --> 03:04:57.400]  They'd much rather see him go to jail.
[03:04:57.400 --> 03:05:01.400]  The globalists are only humans. Yeah, they have control of the central banks.
[03:05:01.400 --> 03:05:06.400]  They have a lot of power, but they can be defeated. But some of their operations are going to take decades to stop.
[03:05:07.400 --> 03:05:15.400]  But one thing you can do right now is take control of your body and your family's body by purifying the water that you drink and that you cook with.
[03:05:15.400 --> 03:05:18.400]  And you do it with the highest quality gravity-fed filter out there.
[03:05:18.400 --> 03:05:23.400]  This thing does 10,000 gallons. You can sit there and put hundreds of gallons through it a day.
[03:05:23.400 --> 03:05:28.400]  It purifies very quickly and it cuts out thousands of chemicals to non-detectable levels.
[03:05:28.400 --> 03:05:33.400]  This is what I use, which my family uses. It's the very best system out there for the lowest price for a limited time.
[03:05:33.400 --> 03:05:43.400]  10% off on top of that exclusively at InfowarStore.com on the Alexa Pure water filtration system in stock and replacement filters for folks that need those in stock.
[03:05:43.400 --> 03:05:46.400]  Get it today and it funds the Infowar. Don't procrastinate.
[03:05:46.400 --> 03:05:53.400]  This is one of the main areas we can take control of our lives and stop the globalists from hitting us with poison that they allow in the water supply.
[03:05:53.400 --> 03:05:56.400]  In some cases, they add to the water supply like fluoride.
[03:06:04.400 --> 03:06:15.400]  You found it. The tip of the spear. It is The Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[03:06:15.400 --> 03:06:22.400]  We're joined now by another great American, Patrick Byrne, on the air here last hour of The Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:22.400 --> 03:06:32.400]  And, I mean, it's no surprise we know how corrupt our country is. We know exactly what the deep state has in store for Donald Trump.
[03:06:32.400 --> 03:06:37.400]  And so this third indictment is no surprise right after, of course, the Devin Archer testimony.
[03:06:37.400 --> 03:06:42.400]  But your response, your response, what you think this is about, where you think it's going.
[03:06:42.400 --> 03:06:46.400]  And just kind of your just guttural reaction to this as an American patriot.
[03:06:46.400 --> 03:06:50.400]  Patrick Byrne. Oh, and good to see you again, sir.
[03:06:50.400 --> 03:06:55.400]  First, it's odd for me because I'm actually a participant.
[03:06:55.400 --> 03:07:01.400]  I was in the room for some of the most important conversations I saw on social media last night.
[03:07:01.400 --> 03:07:08.400]  People who've read the indictment are saying, holy cow, Byrne's testimony is right square in the middle of the case they're trying to make.
[03:07:08.400 --> 03:07:12.400]  So people have figured that out. And I know there was nothing inappropriate in anything I saw.
[03:07:12.400 --> 03:07:19.400]  Everyone conducted themselves. And I can recreate and have on your show the precise conversation.
[03:07:19.400 --> 03:07:25.400]  There was nothing inappropriate. What they're trying to do is, A, provoke a reaction.
[03:07:25.400 --> 03:07:29.400]  B, I think that they're really they're they're doing this out of weakness, not out of strength.
[03:07:29.400 --> 03:07:33.400]  I think that they're really walled in and trying to provoke a reaction.
[03:07:33.400 --> 03:07:36.400]  They're not going to get this tried before the election.
[03:07:36.400 --> 03:07:43.400]  So and the real mistake they're making is now that he's been accused of this, he can subpoena power.
[03:07:43.400 --> 03:07:50.400]  He can subpoena witnesses. He can subpoena everything about the election that we've been fighting to get for two years and been rebuffed.
[03:07:50.400 --> 03:07:54.400]  We can he can now he's got he's got it's called a legal.
[03:07:54.400 --> 03:07:58.400]  He can compel he can compel testimony now because he's accused of federal crime.
[03:07:58.400 --> 03:08:02.400]  So I think it's going to really backfire on the Democrats, you know.
[03:08:02.400 --> 03:08:07.400]  And when I look at these potentials, I guess there's two kind of streams of thought right now.
[03:08:07.400 --> 03:08:13.400]  The one is that, like you just said, this is never even going to make it to trial by the election.
[03:08:13.400 --> 03:08:16.400]  And even if it does go through, he can just appeal it.
[03:08:16.400 --> 03:08:20.400]  The Supreme Court will eventually throw it out. Or, OK, we do go to trial.
[03:08:20.400 --> 03:08:23.400]  They decide to fight it there. He demands discovery.
[03:08:23.400 --> 03:08:27.400]  And then it's like you watch the judge say, nope, you're not allowed to subpoena.
[03:08:27.400 --> 03:08:31.400]  You're not allowed to have discovery. Oh, you play a video of Democrats denying an election.
[03:08:31.400 --> 03:08:35.400]  Strike it from the record. Oh, you show the images of the vote counts going straight up.
[03:08:35.400 --> 03:08:39.400]  Three hundred thousand votes for Biden in the middle of the night. Strike it from the record.
[03:08:39.400 --> 03:08:43.400]  And he just won't be allowed to put any defense or legal argument up in the courtroom.
[03:08:43.400 --> 03:08:51.400]  And then they can witness that. It seems to me that those are kind of the thoughts of where this is going to go right now.
[03:08:51.400 --> 03:08:56.400]  But that's just one of his three cases. Yeah, they're all ridiculous.
[03:08:56.400 --> 03:09:03.400]  The case, you know, in Georgia, Mr. Trump is not the most precise of speech.
[03:09:03.400 --> 03:09:06.400]  He's not a college professor. He's not a lawyer in Georgia.
[03:09:06.400 --> 03:09:14.400]  There were two counties of over three hundred thousand each with ballots, with no chain, not no proper chain of custody.
[03:09:14.400 --> 03:09:19.400]  So six hundred and fifty thousand chains of ballots with no proper chain of custody.
[03:09:19.400 --> 03:09:26.400]  So Trump is saying to some guy down in Georgia, hey, I only lost by whatever, 13000 votes.
[03:09:26.400 --> 03:09:28.400]  Surely you can find 13000 votes.
[03:09:28.400 --> 03:09:34.400]  What he means by that is clearly there are at least six hundred and fifty thousand votes that should be disqualified.
[03:09:34.400 --> 03:09:37.400]  And that's just the beginning. Georgia was the biggest shit show.
[03:09:37.400 --> 03:09:40.400]  They have found all kinds of fraud since then.
[03:09:40.400 --> 03:09:46.400]  There's been they should have disqualified hundreds of thousands, if not a million votes or more.
[03:09:46.400 --> 03:09:50.400]  But it's all he's saying is, you know, he's not saying so.
[03:09:50.400 --> 03:09:54.400]  All he's saying is surely if I'm behind by ten thousand five hundred,
[03:09:54.400 --> 03:10:01.400]  why don't you disqualify some of these hundreds of thousands of fake ballots and see if I'm really still behind?
[03:10:01.400 --> 03:10:03.400]  You know, he's not the most precise speaker.
[03:10:03.400 --> 03:10:09.400]  There's nothing about overturning an election, about asking even, you know,
[03:10:09.400 --> 03:10:14.400]  even the strategy that the Democrats followed in January 6, 2016.
[03:10:14.400 --> 03:10:19.400]  Jamie Raskin, a whole bunch of them stood up in the House and objected to the recognition of electors.
[03:10:19.400 --> 03:10:24.400]  So it was the exact same strategy that Trump was going for on January 6.
[03:10:24.400 --> 03:10:29.400]  The Democrats have denied every presidential election result they've lost in the 21st century.
[03:10:29.400 --> 03:10:31.400]  They make arguments in front of Congress.
[03:10:31.400 --> 03:10:34.400]  And we got hours of tape of them rejecting electoral votes.
[03:10:34.400 --> 03:10:40.400]  Barbara Boxer, 2004, hilarious out there, demanding John Kerry won.
[03:10:40.400 --> 03:10:43.400]  Do they assume the American people are too ignorant?
[03:10:43.400 --> 03:10:45.400]  Do they just think is it is it that what is it?
[03:10:45.400 --> 03:10:49.400]  Is it is it a thing where they just believe we're so ignorant or do they really think we don't care?
[03:10:49.400 --> 03:10:51.400]  We own you now.
[03:10:51.400 --> 03:10:56.400]  They think it's they think that Americans are so ignorant and they're largely right.
[03:10:56.400 --> 03:11:04.400]  Americans have no memory, seem to have no memory and just are able to be psyoped by transparent little schemes like that.
[03:11:04.400 --> 03:11:07.400]  They also I think that they're over their chortling phase.
[03:11:07.400 --> 03:11:11.400]  There was a phase where they were chortling because they're saying we own you now.
[03:11:11.400 --> 03:11:12.400]  We're just going to inflame you.
[03:11:12.400 --> 03:11:14.400]  They're not chortling now.
[03:11:14.400 --> 03:11:15.400]  They know that they're in a fight here.
[03:11:15.400 --> 03:11:18.400]  They know that they've got a real problem.
[03:11:18.400 --> 03:11:24.400]  But I think that they're getting a bit punch drunk, frankly.
[03:11:24.400 --> 03:11:27.400]  So I think that they're desperate.
[03:11:27.400 --> 03:11:29.400]  I think this is an act of desperation.
[03:11:29.400 --> 03:11:30.400]  But we're going to defeat it.
[03:11:30.400 --> 03:11:34.400]  I know that my testimony can defeat absolutely a bunch of the indictment.
[03:11:34.400 --> 03:11:43.400]  I know from personal experience, and I'm not in the least afraid, come what may, to stand up in a courtroom and say exactly what was said in the Oval Office and so on and so forth.
[03:11:43.400 --> 03:11:44.400]  And I'm a witness.
[03:11:44.400 --> 03:11:46.400]  Trump, I've said this before.
[03:11:46.400 --> 03:11:48.400]  I'll repeat it on your show, Owen.
[03:11:48.400 --> 03:11:56.400]  Trump leaned over a couple times and again in a doorway where he said to me, Pat, I have no problem leaving here.
[03:11:56.400 --> 03:12:01.400]  If I didn't win this on January 20th, you see that place, that lawn, Pat?
[03:12:01.400 --> 03:12:02.400]  Marine One's going to land right over there.
[03:12:02.400 --> 03:12:04.400]  I got no problem walking away.
[03:12:04.400 --> 03:12:06.400]  My life's going to get a lot better, Pat.
[03:12:06.400 --> 03:12:07.400]  Believe me.
[03:12:07.400 --> 03:12:09.400]  I will never spend a day in this city again.
[03:12:09.400 --> 03:12:10.400]  I've got my golf courses.
[03:12:10.400 --> 03:12:12.400]  I've got my friends.
[03:12:12.400 --> 03:12:17.400]  But how can I do that if I think another, if this has been rigged and I think another country's involved?
[03:12:17.400 --> 03:12:19.400]  Can I really just surrender like that?
[03:12:19.400 --> 03:12:20.400]  There was absolutely nothing inappropriate.
[03:12:20.400 --> 03:12:24.400]  He was not at all some power-drunk tyrant clutching at power.
[03:12:24.400 --> 03:12:32.400]  I think he was half or more than half quite happy to be on his way out of Washington, D.C.
[03:12:32.400 --> 03:12:33.400]  So there was nothing.
[03:12:33.400 --> 03:12:35.400]  They can't get him for anything on any of that.
[03:12:35.400 --> 03:12:36.400]  So what are they going to try to get him for?
[03:12:36.400 --> 03:12:44.400]  On January 6th, because he said walk peacefully and patriotically down to the Capitol, that that was an incitement to insurrection?
[03:12:44.400 --> 03:12:46.400]  It all sounds really stretched.
[03:12:46.400 --> 03:12:49.400]  Go ahead.
[03:12:49.400 --> 03:12:53.400]  Well, I was going to say, in the indictment, they actually have, the tweets are actually in the indictment.
[03:12:53.400 --> 03:12:56.400]  And then quotes of Trump's speech are in the indictment.
[03:12:56.400 --> 03:13:01.400]  And I mean, folks, literally, they show you the tweet where he says peacefully, patriotically.
[03:13:01.400 --> 03:13:06.400]  They show you the tweet where he says respect law enforcement, even the one where it says go home peacefully.
[03:13:06.400 --> 03:13:08.400]  And they put that in the indictment.
[03:13:08.400 --> 03:13:09.400]  And then they say, see?
[03:13:09.400 --> 03:13:10.400]  See?
[03:13:10.400 --> 03:13:11.400]  He was causing civil unrest.
[03:13:11.400 --> 03:13:13.400]  And it says peace in the thing.
[03:13:13.400 --> 03:13:15.400]  I mean, what?
[03:13:15.400 --> 03:13:19.400]  The people, what I learn is people are very suggestible.
[03:13:19.400 --> 03:13:20.400]  Humans are very suggestible.
[03:13:20.400 --> 03:13:26.400]  These people know that they can, it doesn't matter what the meat of the matter is.
[03:13:26.400 --> 03:13:30.400]  They can dress it up and just repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat and get people to think things.
[03:13:30.400 --> 03:13:32.400]  And people are very suggestible.
[03:13:32.400 --> 03:13:36.400]  It's really been quite a discovery how suggestible people are.
[03:13:36.400 --> 03:13:41.400]  Well, if you want, I mean, I'm not asking you to say anything that you might want to withhold for a courtroom.
[03:13:41.400 --> 03:13:47.400]  But I mean, generally, what was Trump's attitude like when this was all going on?
[03:13:47.400 --> 03:13:52.400]  Because when I saw his statement that he released last night in response to the indictment, it charged me up.
[03:13:52.400 --> 03:13:54.400]  I'm like, we got people that care about this country, man.
[03:13:54.400 --> 03:13:58.400]  We got real people, real Americans that care about this country.
[03:13:58.400 --> 03:14:00.400]  And despite everything they're going through, they're still fighting.
[03:14:00.400 --> 03:14:05.400]  Was it the similar attitude, similar energy that day in the White House?
[03:14:05.400 --> 03:14:08.400]  Actually, I wouldn't call it that way.
[03:14:08.400 --> 03:14:12.400]  I would call it he seemed like a defeated man.
[03:14:12.400 --> 03:14:20.400]  He was surrounded by a bunch of minions who were telling him he was defeated and not to listen to anybody else or any of these other stories.
[03:14:20.400 --> 03:14:25.400]  And they'd been since November 4th in the mode of trying to tell him, don't fight anything.
[03:14:25.400 --> 03:14:27.400]  Don't fight. Just lie back and think of England.
[03:14:27.400 --> 03:14:29.400]  Just let this happen. You lost.
[03:14:29.400 --> 03:14:31.400]  Just don't fight anything.
[03:14:31.400 --> 03:14:35.400]  And he was going around and trying to get people to help him.
[03:14:35.400 --> 03:14:42.400]  And most of the people he was relying on were just weak, weak reeds who weren't really doing anything.
[03:14:42.400 --> 03:14:50.400]  Now, down below, he had a bunch of supporters among his staff who wanted to help, but they were actually getting told by their seniors, don't help Trump.
[03:14:50.400 --> 03:14:51.400]  Just get him in the motive.
[03:14:51.400 --> 03:14:52.400]  We're going to get you out of here.
[03:14:52.400 --> 03:14:54.400]  That's the mood he was in.
[03:14:54.400 --> 03:14:56.400]  And I showed up on December 18th.
[03:14:56.400 --> 03:15:06.400]  That's the mood he was in, but also on the plan of Rudy Giuliani, which was the Green Bay sweep, which we're just going to fight on January 6th.
[03:15:06.400 --> 03:15:14.400]  We're going to get enough senators and members of the House to object to electoral votes from six states.
[03:15:14.400 --> 03:15:20.400]  We're going to get it sent back to the states, have those people take a week, recommit their electoral votes and come back.
[03:15:20.400 --> 03:15:22.400]  That's that's the Green Bay sweep program.
[03:15:22.400 --> 03:15:26.400]  Didn't sound, I suppose, too promising, but that's all Trump had.
[03:15:26.400 --> 03:15:34.400]  So Trump was of the opinion that he had lost in all other things, but he was hanging from that weak reed.
[03:15:34.400 --> 03:15:37.400]  We sneaked into the Oval Office on December 18th.
[03:15:37.400 --> 03:15:45.400]  I won't repeat how, but we got into the Oval Office without an appointment and ended up sitting with the president for four hours.
[03:15:45.400 --> 03:15:49.400]  And we had him sold on.
[03:15:49.400 --> 03:15:51.400]  Well, sold is a big word, but we had him.
[03:15:51.400 --> 03:15:56.400]  We presented a plan that said, sir, I'm hanging on in anticipation during this break.
[03:15:56.400 --> 03:16:04.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and War for the World, is a historic book that documents the globalists in their own words plan for our future.
[03:16:04.400 --> 03:16:06.400]  That is a hellish future.
[03:16:06.400 --> 03:16:14.400]  Now, you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and War for the World at bookstores, Amazon or Infowars.com.
[03:16:15.400 --> 03:16:20.400]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[03:16:20.400 --> 03:16:23.400]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[03:16:23.400 --> 03:16:28.400]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed copy at Infowars.com.
[03:16:28.400 --> 03:16:32.400]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[03:16:32.400 --> 03:16:35.400]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book.
[03:16:35.400 --> 03:16:38.400]  You'll also know that you help keep Infowars on the air.
[03:16:38.400 --> 03:16:42.400]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned copies.
[03:16:42.400 --> 03:16:52.400]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to Infowars.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library or get them to the local school.
[03:16:52.400 --> 03:16:54.400]  This is an Infowar. I'm counting on you.
[03:16:54.400 --> 03:16:56.400]  And thank you for your support.
[03:16:56.400 --> 03:17:02.400]  When I tell you we have the ultimate bone broth, hands down, this is the most concentrated, high-quality bone broth there is.
[03:17:02.400 --> 03:17:06.400]  Concentrated chicken broth, patented amazing.
[03:17:06.400 --> 03:17:10.400]  Then a huge dose of chaga mushroom, a massive dose of bee pollen.
[03:17:10.400 --> 03:17:13.400]  A gigantic dose of highest-quality turmeric.
[03:17:13.400 --> 03:17:15.400]  And then it just gets crazier from there.
[03:17:15.400 --> 03:17:17.400]  It's about to sell out.
[03:17:17.400 --> 03:17:18.400]  We haven't had it in stock for years.
[03:17:18.400 --> 03:17:20.400]  This first new run is about to sell out.

[03:17:54.400 --> 03:17:55.400]  About to sell out.
[03:17:55.400 --> 03:17:58.400]  Infowars is a one-of-a-kind operation.
[03:17:58.400 --> 03:18:01.400]  And so, please, go to Infowars.com and just make a donation.
[03:18:01.400 --> 03:18:03.400]  And you can make it one time or recurring.
[03:18:03.400 --> 03:18:04.400]  You have a little profile there.
[03:18:04.400 --> 03:18:06.400]  Cancel any time.
[03:18:06.400 --> 03:18:15.400]  Every 15 days, every month, every 3 months, every 6 months, up to 9 months, you can go in and every month or every week, whenever you want, you program it.
[03:18:15.400 --> 03:18:18.400]  You just click it, and then you decide when you want to make a donation.
[03:18:18.400 --> 03:18:19.400]  So, please do that as well.
[03:18:19.400 --> 03:18:22.400]  That way, we get 95% of it after credit card fees.
[03:18:22.400 --> 03:18:25.400]  Instead of making 20, 30, 40% like we do on the products.
[03:18:25.400 --> 03:18:26.400]  But these really are amazing products.
[03:18:26.400 --> 03:18:28.400]  The big July 4th sale is going on right now.
[03:18:28.400 --> 03:18:31.400]  This is such a critical platform in the fight against the New World Order.
[03:18:31.400 --> 03:18:32.400]  The enemy is out in the open.
[03:18:32.400 --> 03:18:33.400]  We're vindicated.
[03:18:33.400 --> 03:18:34.400]  People are listening more than ever.
[03:18:34.400 --> 03:18:39.400]  But in this major recession, going into depression, and with supply chain breakdowns, I know it's hard.
[03:18:39.400 --> 03:18:40.400]  I know times are tough.
[03:18:40.400 --> 03:18:42.400]  So, thank you for your support.
[03:18:42.400 --> 03:18:45.400]  But whatever you do, pray for the broadcast and share the articles and the videos.
[03:18:45.400 --> 03:18:47.400]  That you can do for free.
[03:18:47.400 --> 03:18:49.400]  And that's just as important as keeping us on air.
[03:18:49.400 --> 03:18:52.400]  So, however God leads you in your heart to support us, please support us now.
[03:18:52.400 --> 03:18:54.400]  And I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[03:18:54.400 --> 03:18:55.400]  God bless you.
[03:18:55.400 --> 03:18:56.400]  You wanted to plug Rainforce.
[03:18:56.400 --> 03:18:57.400]  Do you like Rainforce?
[03:18:57.400 --> 03:18:58.400]  Yeah.
[03:18:58.400 --> 03:18:59.400]  So, my name is Ken Heckin-Ladley.
[03:19:00.400 --> 03:19:02.400]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[03:19:02.400 --> 03:19:04.400]  Four books with Dr. Judy Mykovitz.
[03:19:04.400 --> 03:19:06.400]  Four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers.
[03:19:06.400 --> 03:19:08.400]  And now two books with Alex Jones.
[03:19:08.400 --> 03:19:12.400]  That's because I use Rainforce every day.
[03:19:12.400 --> 03:19:16.400]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[03:19:16.400 --> 03:19:20.400]  And so, you know, I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins.
[03:19:20.400 --> 03:19:25.400]  But the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is Rainforce.
[03:19:25.400 --> 03:19:29.400]  I'll take Rainforce in the morning right before I go to my computer.
[03:19:29.400 --> 03:19:33.400]  And I'm good for the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[03:19:33.400 --> 03:19:37.400]  So, it really is true that Rainforce is something I use every day.
[03:19:37.400 --> 03:19:39.400]  And it helps me with my writing.
[03:19:39.400 --> 03:19:40.400]  All right. We love you.
[03:19:40.400 --> 03:19:41.400]  We'll be right back.
[03:19:41.400 --> 03:19:45.400]  Get your Rainforce Plus, Rainforce Ultra, and Turbo Force at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:19:45.400 --> 03:19:47.400]  We'll be right back with hour number two.
[03:19:55.500 --> 03:20:04.460]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:04.460 --> 03:20:21.460]  Back here live on the Alex Jones Show, Owen Troyer filling in here, fourth hour, Patrick
[03:20:21.460 --> 03:20:22.460]  Byrne is my guest.
[03:20:23.460 --> 03:20:27.900]  But you were getting into the attitude, the approach of Donald Trump when you saw him
[03:20:27.900 --> 03:20:28.900]  in the White House.
[03:20:28.900 --> 03:20:32.740]  And then how there was kind of a front line of people saying, oh, just give up.
[03:20:32.740 --> 03:20:33.740]  It's over.
[03:20:33.740 --> 03:20:34.740]  You lost.
[03:20:34.740 --> 03:20:38.860]  But they were kind of a wall holding back a supporter saying, no, we're not done here.
[03:20:38.860 --> 03:20:44.820]  And then he was relying on the kind of January 6th with Mike Pence saying, hey, let's investigate
[03:20:44.820 --> 03:20:45.820]  this further.
[03:20:45.820 --> 03:20:47.420]  That obviously ended up not happening.
[03:20:47.420 --> 03:20:48.420]  Yes.
[03:20:48.420 --> 03:20:51.140]  That was to call that the Green Bay Sweep plan.
[03:20:51.140 --> 03:20:56.460]  But we walked in there on December 18th with an argument that he was not aware of.
[03:20:56.460 --> 03:21:01.140]  And the argument was, sir, you have the power to order some investigations.
[03:21:01.140 --> 03:21:07.180]  And this is based on something Barack Obama signed and you yourself signed, and which
[03:21:07.180 --> 03:21:11.380]  are orders that say if there's been federal interference of an election, the president
[03:21:11.380 --> 03:21:15.900]  can step in and order investigations and get to the bottom of it and rerun it, can do anything.
[03:21:15.900 --> 03:21:18.580]  And we're suggesting you just do a little bit, Mr. President.
[03:21:18.580 --> 03:21:20.660]  That's a quick investigation.
[03:21:20.660 --> 03:21:26.140]  And this is based on not theories of vote flipping from space, not theories of South
[03:21:26.140 --> 03:21:27.580]  Korean jets.
[03:21:27.580 --> 03:21:33.900]  This is based on what the federal government itself has said, sir, in the last two months.
[03:21:33.900 --> 03:21:34.900]  And I won't go through it all.
[03:21:34.900 --> 03:21:40.380]  But the DHS and FBI had made a number of statements about foreign attacks coming on our elections.
[03:21:40.380 --> 03:21:44.620]  And on October 22nd, they were saying Iran is trying to hack our elections.
[03:21:44.620 --> 03:21:48.660]  And on November 3rd, they said one of our 50 states has been hacked.
[03:21:48.660 --> 03:21:53.300]  Iran's doing other states and other nations, hostile nations have joined in.
[03:21:53.300 --> 03:21:59.780]  And then by the 6th and the 13th, they were admitted we were in the biggest hack of history.
[03:21:59.780 --> 03:22:05.060]  They announced December 6th, the biggest cybersecurity hack in history, that on the 13th, it was
[03:22:05.060 --> 03:22:06.780]  the SolarWinds hack.
[03:22:06.780 --> 03:22:12.300]  And everything in America got hacked, 425 out of 500, Fortune 500 companies.
[03:22:12.300 --> 03:22:17.980]  The CIA got hacked, the DOD, the NSA, the DHS, the CISA, the this, that, the what, everything
[03:22:17.980 --> 03:22:18.980]  got hacked.
[03:22:18.980 --> 03:22:23.620]  Based on that, Mr. President, and based on what Barack Obama said, that if there's reasonable
[03:22:23.620 --> 03:22:28.900]  belief that the president can order a quick investigation, we're asking to look at six
[03:22:28.900 --> 03:22:29.900]  places.
[03:22:29.900 --> 03:22:36.020]  And ultimately, the conversation came down to a DHS team going into each of six counties,
[03:22:36.020 --> 03:22:40.580]  taking an image of the hard drive, going back and inspecting, seeing if there had been
[03:22:40.580 --> 03:22:43.100]  mischief.
[03:22:43.100 --> 03:22:47.460]  And I even told him, and so that doesn't seem so extreme to me.
[03:22:47.460 --> 03:22:48.460]  I don't know.
[03:22:48.460 --> 03:22:50.060]  We could have got it done in a few days.
[03:22:50.060 --> 03:22:54.020]  And I even told him, sir, the paperwork here says we'll take two weeks, but we'll have an
[03:22:54.020 --> 03:22:55.340]  answer to you in a week.
[03:22:55.340 --> 03:22:59.620]  And we think we'll have, in a few days, we'll be knowing if we're going to find what we think
[03:22:59.620 --> 03:23:00.620]  we're going to find.
[03:23:00.620 --> 03:23:03.620]  And sir, if we don't find it, you're going to need, I think you're going to need to concede
[03:23:03.620 --> 03:23:04.620]  immediately.
[03:23:04.620 --> 03:23:05.620]  He cut me off.
[03:23:06.220 --> 03:23:07.220]  I said, Pat, you got no idea.
[03:23:07.220 --> 03:23:11.380]  He had no idea, believe me, how easy that's going to be for me to conceive.
[03:23:11.380 --> 03:23:12.500]  You have no idea, Pat.
[03:23:12.500 --> 03:23:16.620]  I can walk right over the, I'll walk out of here proud of what I've done.
[03:23:16.620 --> 03:23:19.460]  I've got no problem doing that.
[03:23:19.460 --> 03:23:21.140]  But if I, how can I do that?
[03:23:21.140 --> 03:23:23.340]  If there's been a foreign, I know this has been rigged.
[03:23:23.340 --> 03:23:26.020]  And if there's a foreign government involved, how can I do that?
[03:23:26.020 --> 03:23:27.340]  So that was perfectly appropriate.
[03:23:27.340 --> 03:23:28.340]  They can't get him for that.
[03:23:28.340 --> 03:23:32.980]  What happened, though, was after we left, after four hours where we thought we had him
[03:23:32.980 --> 03:23:35.860]  reasonably on board.
[03:23:35.860 --> 03:23:40.260]  And I'll tell you what, the next morning we woke up with him saying, we got to even reduce
[03:23:40.260 --> 03:23:45.440]  it down to, we had given him options of six, 13 or 31 counties.
[03:23:45.440 --> 03:23:48.900]  We in the morning were said, let's reduce it down to even one county.
[03:23:48.900 --> 03:23:54.380]  I think we got feedback saying, let's come up with a plan that's just a one county investigation.
[03:23:54.380 --> 03:23:58.980]  But what happened unbeknownst to us, when we walked out at 1250 at night, Rudy Giuliani
[03:23:58.980 --> 03:24:02.620]  got him turned around in two minutes and said, sir, Mr. President, if we go through with
[03:24:02.620 --> 03:24:05.580]  Byrne's plan, we're all going to end up in prison.
[03:24:05.580 --> 03:24:06.940]  So they didn't do it.
[03:24:06.940 --> 03:24:12.320]  So Donald Trump, who had been real low, and then we came in with our story and got him
[03:24:12.320 --> 03:24:14.320]  up for four hours.
[03:24:14.320 --> 03:24:17.580]  And then Rudy turns him around as soon as we leave and says, no, none of this is going
[03:24:17.580 --> 03:24:18.580]  to work.
[03:24:18.580 --> 03:24:19.580]  Drop it.
[03:24:19.580 --> 03:24:20.580]  He drops it.
[03:24:20.580 --> 03:24:22.860]  Donald Trump goes up to his bedroom.
[03:24:22.860 --> 03:24:28.140]  And an hour and 15 minutes later, he tweets out, hey, everybody come to D.C. on January
[03:24:28.140 --> 03:24:29.140]  6th.
[03:24:29.140 --> 03:24:30.140]  It's going to be wild.
[03:24:30.140 --> 03:24:34.060]  Because he had just had this emotional roller coaster for four or five hours.
[03:24:34.060 --> 03:24:40.160]  He was now back on the Green Bay Sweep plan.
[03:24:40.160 --> 03:24:42.060]  So that's how it all happened.
[03:24:42.060 --> 03:24:48.460]  What the prosecutors have tried to portray, or at least in the questioning, the narrative
[03:24:48.460 --> 03:24:54.140]  they tried to go with was that we had created some color revolution scheme and went in December
[03:24:54.140 --> 03:24:58.500]  18th to brief him and taught him the color revolution.
[03:24:58.500 --> 03:25:02.700]  And that's why he went up at one o'clock in the morning and said, hey, everybody come
[03:25:02.700 --> 03:25:06.020]  to Washington because we're going to have a color revolution.
[03:25:06.020 --> 03:25:07.780]  That's how they're trying to connect it all.
[03:25:07.780 --> 03:25:09.260]  Unfortunately for them, I'm in the middle of it.
[03:25:09.260 --> 03:25:10.820]  They're going to have to impugn my testimony.
[03:25:10.820 --> 03:25:12.180]  Well, it's falling apart.
[03:25:12.180 --> 03:25:13.180]  They can't possibly.
[03:25:13.180 --> 03:25:14.180]  It's delusional.
[03:25:14.180 --> 03:25:15.180]  It's delusional.
[03:25:15.180 --> 03:25:16.180]  All right.
[03:25:16.180 --> 03:25:23.060]  You get to get the frog out of your throat there, get yourself a drink of water.
[03:25:23.060 --> 03:25:25.380]  I'm glad you're breaking that down for us.
[03:25:25.380 --> 03:25:33.860]  Okay, so let's assume, maybe not the best assumption to make, but let's assume that
[03:25:33.860 --> 03:25:36.100]  Trump gets a fair trial here.
[03:25:36.100 --> 03:25:40.700]  Let's say this goes to trial and he starts subpoenaing, demanding discovery.
[03:25:40.700 --> 03:25:46.500]  He wants to know how Biden gets 300,000 votes in Detroit, in Philadelphia, the rest of the
[03:25:46.500 --> 03:25:49.900]  stuff that goes on, the Zuckerbucks, all of this stuff.
[03:25:49.900 --> 03:25:51.300]  What is the approach at that point?
[03:25:51.300 --> 03:25:54.660]  Because it sounds like you guys were already kind of laying the groundwork for that, but
[03:25:54.660 --> 03:25:55.740]  they abandoned that plan.
[03:25:55.740 --> 03:25:58.660]  So now we can maybe come back to it in a courtroom.
[03:25:58.660 --> 03:26:00.140]  Is it a similar strategy?
[03:26:00.140 --> 03:26:01.140]  Yes.
[03:26:01.140 --> 03:26:04.140]  Well, it's kind of funny because we never really abandoned the plan.
[03:26:04.140 --> 03:26:08.020]  We've kept on going the last two and a half years and we've gotten stuff.
[03:26:08.020 --> 03:26:09.020]  We've gotten amazing.
[03:26:09.020 --> 03:26:12.020]  It's been slow because we didn't have, it was hooker by crook.
[03:26:12.020 --> 03:26:17.340]  But for example, just a week ago, we've been backing some guy, a very interesting guy from
[03:26:17.340 --> 03:26:24.620]  North Jersey who uses Freedom of Information Act requests rather than using election law
[03:26:24.620 --> 03:26:29.540]  for citizens to audit, give something the other, the bad guys can bite into and fight
[03:26:29.540 --> 03:26:30.540]  us.
[03:26:30.540 --> 03:26:33.020]  And we've learned for the first time in history, we've learned that we actually can't look
[03:26:33.020 --> 03:26:34.020]  at elections.
[03:26:34.020 --> 03:26:35.020]  We just got to trust them.
[03:26:35.020 --> 03:26:38.980]  America's never knew this before, but this other fellow has been using Freedom of Information
[03:26:38.980 --> 03:26:46.180]  Act and got, citizens can get the right to inspect a bunch of things and they can't stop
[03:26:46.180 --> 03:26:47.180]  that.
[03:26:48.020 --> 03:26:51.940]  He's got the right to inspect ballots in Detroit that were recently examined by Eric Spakine,
[03:26:51.940 --> 03:26:56.780]  who's a noted CEO of a forensic firm with 125 scientists.
[03:26:56.780 --> 03:26:59.420]  They've testified in 10,000 court cases.
[03:26:59.420 --> 03:27:00.420]  He's done 450.
[03:27:00.420 --> 03:27:03.140]  He's done election cases for 25 years.
[03:27:03.140 --> 03:27:09.820]  One of the nation's premier forensic scientists, CEO of his own firm says he went up and validated
[03:27:09.820 --> 03:27:11.740]  this data and submitted a report last week.
[03:27:11.740 --> 03:27:18.860]  It turns out between eight and 20% of the mail-in ballots are stuffed in Detroit.
[03:27:18.860 --> 03:27:19.860]  Between eight and 20%.
[03:27:19.860 --> 03:27:23.940]  We're talking about an election Biden won by two-tenths of a percent.
[03:27:23.940 --> 03:27:27.060]  Turns out eight to 20% of the ballots are stuffed.
[03:27:27.060 --> 03:27:31.700]  There's huge, we finally got the ability to inspect what we've been wanting to inspect
[03:27:31.700 --> 03:27:32.700]  since November 4th.
[03:27:32.700 --> 03:27:37.700]  It's kind of funny because Sidney Powell's appeal on her sanctions is next week and she
[03:27:37.700 --> 03:27:42.660]  can finally argue, look, you're sanctioning me, Sidney Powell, for filing cases saying
[03:27:42.660 --> 03:27:44.700]  we should go inspect those ballots.
[03:27:44.700 --> 03:27:48.980]  Now that they have been inspected, we found exactly what we were suspecting.
[03:27:48.980 --> 03:27:51.660]  How can you sanction me for anything?
[03:27:51.660 --> 03:27:52.660]  It turns out I was right.
[03:27:52.660 --> 03:27:57.820]  So she's got a clear, in any normal world, she's got a clear overturn on her sanctions.
[03:27:57.820 --> 03:28:01.100]  All the Michigan lawyers who've been sanctioned there is clearly overturned.
[03:28:01.100 --> 03:28:05.900]  We have found, and you should publicize this, we have found, if we had found this on November
[03:28:05.900 --> 03:28:10.500]  4th or November 10th, it would have convinced the whole country.
[03:28:10.500 --> 03:28:13.940]  It just took us two and a half years to fight our way to it.
[03:28:13.940 --> 03:28:14.940]  But we have it.
[03:28:14.940 --> 03:28:16.380]  Well, now Trump can get all that.
[03:28:16.380 --> 03:28:20.380]  We've already got a whole bunch of stuff done that we can just hand, and the stuff that we
[03:28:20.380 --> 03:28:23.060]  don't have done, he can just file subpoenas and get.
[03:28:23.060 --> 03:28:27.620]  How it will work, incidentally, Owen, is the judge will first figure out, is this well-formed,
[03:28:27.620 --> 03:28:28.620]  these cases?
[03:28:28.620 --> 03:28:35.300]  Like, is there actually even a case here, assuming everything the prosecutor says is truthful?
[03:28:35.300 --> 03:28:37.380]  I'm not even sure on these.
[03:28:37.380 --> 03:28:42.540]  And so only if that's true do they then go through this very long discovery process.
[03:28:42.540 --> 03:28:46.340]  I think that the actual trial is never going to happen before the election.
[03:28:46.340 --> 03:28:47.340]  All right.
[03:28:47.340 --> 03:28:48.340]  Pause it right there.
[03:28:48.340 --> 03:28:49.340]  We're up against the brake.
[03:28:49.340 --> 03:28:54.020]  Let's talk about the trial and also the interesting stuff that you guys have seen that we should
[03:28:54.020 --> 03:28:55.020]  publicize.
[03:28:55.020 --> 03:28:58.660]  It's been three years since we had it.
[03:28:58.660 --> 03:29:04.020]  We got it back in stock, the amazing 30 parts per million, highest quality colloidal silver

[03:32:55.900 --> 03:33:22.900]  Broadcasting live from the U.N. stronghold, Austin, TX, you're listening to The Alex Jones
[03:33:22.900 --> 03:33:23.900]  Show.
[03:33:23.900 --> 03:33:24.900]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[03:33:24.900 --> 03:33:25.900]  All right, Patrick Byrne with us here on The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:25.900 --> 03:33:26.900]  Now, Patrick, you got cut off by the break, kind of getting into the strategy of what
[03:33:26.900 --> 03:33:27.900]  needs to be done now in these Trump cases.
[03:33:27.900 --> 03:33:28.900]  Do you want to pick it up from there?
[03:33:28.900 --> 03:33:29.900]  Or you really got interrupted when you were explaining why you don't believe this is even
[03:33:29.900 --> 03:33:30.900]  going to make it to trial.
[03:33:30.900 --> 03:33:31.900]  Well, before it makes it to trial, there's going to be this period which Trump can stretch
[03:33:31.900 --> 03:33:32.900]  out as long as he wants, a long time, with discovery requests.
[03:33:32.900 --> 03:33:33.900]  And I think it's going to be a long time.
[03:33:33.900 --> 03:33:34.900]  And I think it's going to be a long time.
[03:33:34.900 --> 03:33:35.900]  And I think it's going to be a long time.
[03:33:35.900 --> 03:33:36.900]  And I think it's going to be a long time.
[03:33:36.900 --> 03:33:37.900]  And I think it's going to be a long time.
[03:33:38.900 --> 03:33:39.900]  So there's that.
[03:33:39.900 --> 03:33:40.900]  It's never going to see trial before the election.
[03:33:40.900 --> 03:33:41.900]  So there's that.
[03:33:41.900 --> 03:33:42.900]  It's never going to see trial before the election.

[03:47:05.800 --> 03:47:20.119]  Well, it's an amazing thing, honestly, the best bet you can make at this point, whatever
[03:47:20.119 --> 03:47:26.240]  they, and we know who they is, whatever they accused Donald Trump of, they are most likely
[03:47:26.240 --> 03:47:28.759]  guilty of themselves.
[03:47:28.759 --> 03:47:31.800]  That's pretty much the simplest way to put this.
[03:47:31.800 --> 03:47:38.640]  And when they cry election interference, it's them that engage in election interference.
[03:47:38.640 --> 03:47:45.060]  Now, Patrick Byrne is breaking this down, how this third indictment of Trump can open
[03:47:45.060 --> 03:47:50.519]  up the window of opportunity for discovery and evidence to be put forth in a courtroom
[03:47:50.519 --> 03:47:55.160]  that says, yes, clearly there is reasons to question the results of the 2020 election,
[03:47:55.160 --> 03:47:57.640]  if not outright proof of fraud.
[03:47:57.640 --> 03:48:01.359]  And so Patrick, you were getting into some of the stuff that you've seen.
[03:48:01.359 --> 03:48:06.759]  And here's the thing too, I hear the arguments coming, which is, oh, that's just one county
[03:48:06.759 --> 03:48:08.880]  or that's just one this or one that.
[03:48:08.880 --> 03:48:11.519]  No, you, these are not isolated incidents.
[03:48:11.519 --> 03:48:14.400]  When you find one thing, you investigate further.
[03:48:14.400 --> 03:48:18.519]  So I mean, how, how long could you talk about the stuff that you have discovered?
[03:48:18.519 --> 03:48:20.880]  Oh, we could talk all day and night.
[03:48:20.880 --> 03:48:21.880]  I can go on and on.
[03:48:21.880 --> 03:48:25.099]  There are so many reports, so many of these findings everywhere people have been.
[03:48:25.099 --> 03:48:30.400]  So the, that, that Williamson County, Tennessee error, the Tennessee error, it's been found
[03:48:30.439 --> 03:48:36.400]  in Pennsylvania, Fulton County, Pennsylvania, looked at one, inspected their own equipment.
[03:48:36.400 --> 03:48:40.800]  The dirty secretary of state and attorney general tried to stop them.
[03:48:40.800 --> 03:48:41.800]  They got it done anyway.
[03:48:41.800 --> 03:48:44.480]  And they found the error within their own equipment.
[03:48:44.480 --> 03:48:50.320]  So and I think that equipment is involved in tabulating 40% of the ballots counted in
[03:48:50.320 --> 03:48:58.039]  America has a Tennessee, you know, has is the model of that has the, maybe it's 25% or something
[03:48:58.320 --> 03:49:01.279]  that is this five democracy suite 5.4.
[03:49:01.279 --> 03:49:05.960]  So I mean, our, our systems are, I've been the CEO of a public company.
[03:49:05.960 --> 03:49:09.240]  And when you, you have to report quarterly numbers to the world.
[03:49:09.240 --> 03:49:14.920]  And sometimes it happens that you're going along and you find out, Oh, there's some glitch
[03:49:14.920 --> 03:49:20.320]  in the system you built 18 months ago down in the bowels when you started that new program
[03:49:20.320 --> 03:49:23.920]  and how it was all this fitting was supposed to connect to that.
[03:49:23.920 --> 03:49:25.599]  And Oh, the accounting wasn't right.
[03:49:25.599 --> 03:49:27.679]  And there was, well, the accounting wasn't right.
[03:49:28.320 --> 03:49:30.720]  And there's several hundred thousand dollars or maybe a couple million dollars that didn't
[03:49:30.720 --> 03:49:32.400]  get accounted for the moment.
[03:49:32.400 --> 03:49:36.519]  You know, that's a possibility as the CEO of a public company.
[03:49:36.519 --> 03:49:38.140]  That's even a possibility.
[03:49:38.140 --> 03:49:43.000]  You have like 24 to 48 hours to come out and tell the world, folks, we need to inform you
[03:49:43.000 --> 03:49:45.880]  that those numbers we gave you in the past, they're not reliable.
[03:49:45.880 --> 03:49:46.880]  We're going to dig in.
[03:49:46.880 --> 03:49:50.359]  And within 30 days, we'll have it all figured and we'll get the truth to you.
[03:49:50.359 --> 03:49:52.800]  You have that obligation as a public CEO.
[03:49:52.800 --> 03:49:55.759]  And Donald Trump is the CEO of America.
[03:49:55.759 --> 03:49:57.920]  And this is what he's seeing.
[03:49:57.920 --> 03:50:03.480]  If I ran any of the mayor of the, of the Detroit, of the different operations, these election
[03:50:03.480 --> 03:50:06.679]  operations, they are far, far beyond the point.
[03:50:06.679 --> 03:50:09.160]  They should be worrying about anything they signed.
[03:50:09.160 --> 03:50:12.400]  They signed and certified a whole bunch of stuff that turned out to be lies.
[03:50:12.400 --> 03:50:14.320]  And everywhere you dig into it, it's lies.
[03:50:14.320 --> 03:50:16.920]  Here's one of the most important things you must know about Tina Peters.
[03:50:16.920 --> 03:50:19.480]  Oh, and you know that story about that wonderful woman.
[03:50:19.480 --> 03:50:20.480]  Yeah.
[03:50:20.480 --> 03:50:25.000]  And by the way, she is one of many expert witnesses that revealed what they saw the
[03:50:25.000 --> 03:50:26.000]  day of the election.
[03:50:26.000 --> 03:50:27.000]  Yeah.
[03:50:27.000 --> 03:50:28.480]  And it's not just what they saw.
[03:50:28.480 --> 03:50:30.800]  They found thanks to her.
[03:50:30.800 --> 03:50:38.320]  They took an image was gotten of the hard drive of that machine before the state Colorado
[03:50:38.320 --> 03:50:42.800]  state Soros people showed up and wiped it clean.
[03:50:42.800 --> 03:50:48.480]  And what they discovered was there, in fact, a yes, they did destroy 100000 files, which
[03:50:48.480 --> 03:50:51.560]  is a hundred thousand crimes, setting that aside.
[03:50:51.560 --> 03:50:56.119]  What they discovered is the election of 2020 had any legal manipulation in the middle
[03:50:56.119 --> 03:50:57.119]  of it.
[03:50:57.119 --> 03:51:02.199]  Something woke up some hidden code within the machine, woke up, created a new database,
[03:51:02.199 --> 03:51:08.880]  sucked over 24,000 votes, but 6,000 extra votes showed up in an account that has a hundred
[03:51:08.880 --> 03:51:10.119]  thousand votes.
[03:51:10.119 --> 03:51:16.880]  So they, and that, and that behavior on that machine is entirely consistent with there
[03:51:16.880 --> 03:51:21.519]  being a hidden script, which is entirely consistent with the Tennessee error.
[03:51:21.519 --> 03:51:26.000]  The whole, because again, I'm trying to make sure the language here so that people don't
[03:51:26.000 --> 03:51:29.240]  necessarily, they don't understand computer science might understand.
[03:51:29.240 --> 03:51:35.039]  So it sounds like basically let's say the results are coming in and Trump is winning and there's
[03:51:35.039 --> 03:51:38.720]  something hidden in the algorithm, in the machine that as soon as, let's say Trump goes
[03:51:38.720 --> 03:51:42.960]  up 5%, it flips on and all of a sudden the things change.
[03:51:42.960 --> 03:51:45.320]  That sounds like what you're talking about.
[03:51:45.560 --> 03:51:49.519]  It looks like what happened in Mesa County, Colorado, which is where Grand Junction is
[03:51:49.519 --> 03:51:51.480]  in 2020.
[03:51:51.480 --> 03:51:56.480]  And the same thing happened in May of 2021 in a city election where they got, the machine
[03:51:56.480 --> 03:52:01.920]  gets through counting a quarter of the votes, then it wakes up and creates a new illegal
[03:52:01.920 --> 03:52:08.599]  database without any further human intervention, siphons the votes over to make it look like
[03:52:08.599 --> 03:52:15.439]  it was the original database and then adds a bunch of votes and did some manipulation.
[03:52:15.439 --> 03:52:19.960]  And then counts the rest of the 70, 75% of the votes.
[03:52:19.960 --> 03:52:21.359]  That happened in Mesa County.
[03:52:21.359 --> 03:52:23.599]  There's no explanation.
[03:52:23.599 --> 03:52:29.160]  And that would be entirely consistent with this Tennessee error that the government itself
[03:52:29.160 --> 03:52:31.400]  is now admitting, that Dominion now admits.
[03:52:31.400 --> 03:52:36.320]  The election assistant, it's not crazy theories, it's the EAC of the federal government now
[03:52:36.400 --> 03:52:40.840]  admits there's this thing called the Tennessee error and a whole bunch of these machines.
[03:52:40.840 --> 03:52:45.000]  So Trump, you'd think he's got a, he's got a layup.
[03:52:45.000 --> 03:52:46.840]  He's got a shot from the pain anyway.
[03:52:46.840 --> 03:52:49.720]  I think it's ridiculous that they're, they're going to look terrible.
[03:52:49.720 --> 03:52:52.759]  This is going to blow up in their face because we now have all the data.
[03:52:52.759 --> 03:52:57.039]  Plus now that he's got subpoena power, we can not only feed him the results of everything
[03:52:57.039 --> 03:53:01.960]  we've done for two years, all of this kind of stuff that's been 15, 20 places, stores
[03:53:01.960 --> 03:53:08.960]  like I just given you, it's, I mean, it's, I think they're going to napalm.
[03:53:08.960 --> 03:53:11.960]  So anyway, I think they're going to win those cases, but it's never going to get to trial
[03:53:11.960 --> 03:53:13.560]  because he's going to be president first.
[03:53:13.560 --> 03:53:19.840]  Well, you've seen a lot of, and you've been reporting this to going around in media interviews,
[03:53:19.840 --> 03:53:23.960]  a lot of the stuff that you've seen from the forensic analysis, others have been doing
[03:53:23.960 --> 03:53:25.119]  this as well.
[03:53:25.119 --> 03:53:29.119]  But even just from what's out there publicly with it, with any, any common American can
[03:53:29.119 --> 03:53:30.119]  go see.
[03:53:30.119 --> 03:53:37.240]  They can go look at the voting results in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and Michigan and
[03:53:37.240 --> 03:53:42.039]  Georgia and Arizona that all look the exact same with the vote viagra for Biden.
[03:53:42.039 --> 03:53:43.039]  Just going straight up.
[03:53:43.039 --> 03:53:44.039]  Just, just straight.
[03:53:44.039 --> 03:53:49.060]  I mean, if you gave this to a second grader and you said, hi, second grader, find the
[03:53:49.060 --> 03:53:54.199]  anomaly in this line graph, they would point right to the vote viagra for Biden at three
[03:53:54.199 --> 03:53:55.199]  30 in the morning.
[03:53:55.199 --> 03:53:56.720]  This happened in five States.
[03:53:56.720 --> 03:54:01.000]  We can show the trucks pulling up with truckloads of ballots at three in the morning.
[03:54:01.000 --> 03:54:02.880]  I mean, it's like all this is publicly available.
[03:54:02.880 --> 03:54:06.679]  The 3000 mules documentary, I mean, there's enough just available to the public to raise
[03:54:06.679 --> 03:54:07.679]  question.
[03:54:07.679 --> 03:54:10.000]  You know where else that happened, Owen?
[03:54:10.000 --> 03:54:12.320]  That happened in Ukraine in 2014.
[03:54:12.320 --> 03:54:17.279]  That happened in Fallujah and Iraq, Iraq 08.
[03:54:17.279 --> 03:54:20.759]  It happened in the Philippines in 2010 and 2016.
[03:54:20.759 --> 03:54:21.840]  It happened in Ghana.
[03:54:21.840 --> 03:54:22.840]  It happened everywhere.
[03:54:22.840 --> 03:54:24.599]  They use this equipment.
[03:54:24.599 --> 03:54:29.240]  And every time there's a crazy story about why we had to shut down, we had to shut down
[03:54:29.240 --> 03:54:34.560]  counting because somebody spilled something or because of water for a main overflow or
[03:54:34.560 --> 03:54:38.279]  because the Russians had an attack or because the sun's rising in the West.
[03:54:38.279 --> 03:54:40.160]  So we had to shut down counting.
[03:54:40.160 --> 03:54:42.039]  And what do you know when we turn it back up?
[03:54:42.039 --> 03:54:45.599]  Oh, in the county, there's this, there's this, what do you call it?
[03:54:45.599 --> 03:54:46.599]  Vote viagra.
[03:54:46.599 --> 03:54:47.599]  Yeah.
[03:54:47.599 --> 03:54:50.080]  I call it vote viagra.
[03:54:50.080 --> 03:54:51.080]  It sends it straight up.
[03:54:51.080 --> 03:54:53.880]  I mean, that's, you know, but Biden needed to though.
[03:54:53.880 --> 03:54:57.199]  Biden actually, if you go look, Biden needed multiple vote viagras.
[03:54:57.199 --> 03:54:59.279]  Well, he's older.
[03:54:59.279 --> 03:55:00.560]  It happened all over the world.
[03:55:00.560 --> 03:55:01.560]  It happened.
[03:55:01.560 --> 03:55:03.480]  It happens all over the world where there are these phony elections.
[03:55:03.480 --> 03:55:04.480]  This happens.
[03:55:04.480 --> 03:55:08.039]  And they have different cockamamie stories to explain it in each one.
[03:55:08.039 --> 03:55:09.039]  It's absurd.
[03:55:09.039 --> 03:55:10.039]  Yeah.
[03:55:10.039 --> 03:55:11.480]  So I think that he's got them beat.
[03:55:11.480 --> 03:55:13.519]  I don't even think these cases are well formed.
[03:55:13.519 --> 03:55:15.720]  A good judge should throw these out.
[03:55:15.720 --> 03:55:20.320]  Like why is it possibly sedition or no?
[03:55:20.640 --> 03:55:24.759]  They don't have the J6 charges aren't about sedition or insurrection.
[03:55:24.759 --> 03:55:29.359]  It just has to do with interfering with a federal process or something.
[03:55:29.359 --> 03:55:33.039]  So I guess they're going to say, well, by telling people to march to the Capitol and
[03:55:33.039 --> 03:55:38.880]  by insinuating or they're going to say he insinuated to go inside and disrupt Congress
[03:55:38.880 --> 03:55:41.359]  that was disrupting a federal proceeding.
[03:55:41.359 --> 03:55:45.279]  Is that that's the argument more or less?
[03:55:45.279 --> 03:55:46.279]  Yes.
[03:55:46.279 --> 03:55:48.960]  That sounds like a good judge should say this is just shouldn't.
[03:55:49.080 --> 03:55:50.599]  Oh, this is going in front of a judge.
[03:55:50.599 --> 03:55:52.960]  I know a judge out in.
[03:55:52.960 --> 03:55:54.640]  She was Maria Boutina's judge.
[03:55:54.640 --> 03:55:57.039]  She was Obama's second term appointment.
[03:55:57.039 --> 03:55:58.039]  Tanya Chutkin.
[03:55:58.039 --> 03:55:59.039]  Yeah.
[03:55:59.039 --> 03:56:00.039]  Tanya Chutkin.
[03:56:00.039 --> 03:56:01.039]  Look up.
[03:56:01.039 --> 03:56:02.039]  I've written about Ms. Chutkin.
[03:56:02.039 --> 03:56:03.039]  Her Honor.
[03:56:03.039 --> 03:56:04.039]  Your Honor.
[03:56:04.039 --> 03:56:07.160]  I've written about her.
[03:56:07.160 --> 03:56:09.199]  And you can look her up on Deep Capture.
[03:56:09.199 --> 03:56:10.199]  Yeah.
[03:56:10.199 --> 03:56:15.000]  Well, I mean, I just I feel comfortable knowing that this Obama appointed judge from Jamaica
[03:56:15.000 --> 03:56:19.039]  is certainly not going to go in there with any bias or any anti-white bigotry or trying
[03:56:19.039 --> 03:56:22.359]  to get revenge for any of her black ancestors against the white man.
[03:56:22.359 --> 03:56:24.960]  I feel confident that that's not going to happen.
[03:56:24.960 --> 03:56:28.119]  You know what happened with Maria Boutina, you know, as a rape and murder?
[03:56:28.119 --> 03:56:32.519]  Well, if you want to talk about, we got 90 seconds till we're all fair, might be another
[03:56:32.519 --> 03:56:34.359]  story for another day.
[03:56:34.359 --> 03:56:41.800]  Her whole I set up the federal government and a great anyway, her Honor Chutkin's back
[03:56:41.800 --> 03:56:48.119]  finding in the case of Maria Boutina turned out to be amazingly shortsighted and leave
[03:56:48.119 --> 03:56:49.119]  something to be desired.
[03:56:49.119 --> 03:56:50.119]  I'll leave it at that.
[03:56:50.119 --> 03:56:54.679]  That was a part of the big Russian collusion nonsense that they were trying to build a
[03:56:54.679 --> 03:56:55.679]  narrative on.
[03:56:55.679 --> 03:56:59.400]  Patrick Byrne, thank you so much for your excellent analysis today.
[03:56:59.400 --> 03:57:00.400]  Thank you.

[03:57:11.519 --> 03:57:12.519]  Patrick Byrne.
[03:57:12.519 --> 03:57:13.519]  Thank you.
