[00:00.000 --> 00:08.800]  media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN
[00:08.800 --> 00:23.100]  radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:23.100 --> 00:30.700]  There have been extremely dark developments on every front in the last 24 hours since
[00:30.700 --> 00:36.840]  we were last with you. 20 hours, if you want to be technical, for our radio show once a
[00:36.840 --> 00:44.780]  day, so we're here every 20 hours. Barack Obama has called for a million-man youth
[00:44.780 --> 00:52.720]  brigade spy force. He said, a stasi youth brigade of teenagers. Now, if you think the
[00:52.720 --> 00:59.820]  corrupt police are bad now, folks, historically with Mao and Lenin and Hitler, and it goes
[00:59.820 --> 01:07.180]  back to Rome. They love to turn loose teenagers with badges and guns. And he is saying a military
[01:07.180 --> 01:14.380]  youth force. Hell Force is the proper name for it, and I don't mean that for a comic
[01:14.380 --> 01:18.660]  book term. I mean, this is hell on earth being turned loose. Now, remember, Bill Clinton
[01:18.660 --> 01:26.420]  proposed this. In my film, the police state 2000, I talk about how he proposed youth brigades.
[01:26.420 --> 01:32.380]  And then under Bush, they started the Secure Corps, a subset of AmeriCorps that Clinton
[01:32.380 --> 01:38.780]  began, and they train high schoolers in junior high all over the country with M16s, warrants,
[01:38.780 --> 01:43.780]  service, checkpoints, how to report on their parents. This is all public. It's in road
[01:43.780 --> 01:51.540]  to tyranny as well. But now they want to expand that to a million beginning. And it says,
[01:51.540 --> 01:58.060]  to spy, it says a intelligence slash military slash police force. We're talking a million
[01:58.060 --> 02:05.300]  plus punks, a million plus punks on power trips, having their way with us. I mean, it
[02:05.300 --> 02:11.300]  doesn't get more classical tyranny. This is right out of 1984, which was based on the
[02:11.300 --> 02:19.020]  Soviet system that George Arwell had covered, actually worked for for a time that we figured
[02:19.020 --> 02:26.780]  out it was corrupt. So I mean, it's the ultimate. It's the royal flush. It is the royal flush
[02:26.780 --> 02:36.140]  of tyranny. You just cannot beat it. It is the Kremlin of evil. And it is in the Chicago
[02:36.140 --> 02:42.780]  Tribune gave a speech and he said he will create a force of youth carrying out security
[02:42.780 --> 02:48.420]  and spying operations larger than all the military forces. Now, that's already being
[02:48.420 --> 02:53.180]  done. He's just the front man pushing that. But to have them announce it, one tenth of
[02:53.180 --> 02:58.580]  college grads now Homeland Security related ITT technical other technical schools, about
[02:58.580 --> 03:05.460]  20%. I looked us up a few months ago of their teaching is now computers. They've shifted
[03:05.460 --> 03:11.080]  into, quote, law enforcement and security. And they are now hiring the other royal flush
[03:11.080 --> 03:15.620]  of tyranny. And that is aggravated felons and illegal aliens who are aggravated felons.
[03:15.620 --> 03:20.500]  That's their that's their crim dollar, crim there. They look for people who are felons
[03:20.500 --> 03:28.720]  and foreigners. Just just a double tyranny, a double mega tyranny. I mean, hiring felons
[03:28.720 --> 03:34.500]  for the police is is is hardcore super tyranny. The communists Chinese don't even do that.
[03:34.500 --> 03:39.660]  The Nazis and the communists Russians did the Bolsheviks led by the famous bank robber
[03:39.660 --> 03:45.260]  and tortured, of course, Joe Stalin, but to then hire foreigners who are criminals.
[03:45.260 --> 03:54.580]  That is, that is a level never before seen only the United States run by the most hardcore
[03:54.580 --> 03:59.060]  criminals who studied every tyranny. They said that they studied every tyranny and they
[03:59.060 --> 04:08.780]  are trying to in perfect a tyranny, the likes of which the world has never seen. And they
[04:08.780 --> 04:13.100]  are doing it. And you heard Richard C. Cook yesterday was a White House analyst, Treasury
[04:13.100 --> 04:19.660]  Department analyst, NASA analyst, very well respected historian saying that that is their
[04:19.660 --> 04:25.260]  plan. They want a purge of the middle class. Most of you who serve them mindlessly, they
[04:25.260 --> 04:35.180]  plan to kill you and your family. They are not hiring felons and million man and woman
[04:35.180 --> 04:40.100]  goon cores for nothing. It is going to be just like the communist youth brigades under
[04:40.100 --> 04:48.860]  Mao under the chairman. They are accelerating their program and it gets worse. They are
[04:48.860 --> 04:53.900]  going to use the National Guard in policing. It's now been announced. Stay with us.
[04:53.900 --> 04:58.380]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in Internet history comes
[04:58.380 --> 05:04.620]  the long awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two hour film that completely

[05:18.580 --> 05:24.060]  Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose. From hijackers being trained at US military bases

[07:54.980 --> 08:01.500]  Today's Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[08:01.500 --> 08:18.820]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[08:18.820 --> 08:27.500]  Obama calls for national civilian Stasi armed spies, a million to start with, on top of
[08:27.500 --> 08:33.820]  the two million plus police. Their auxiliaries are swelling in between the new environmental
[08:33.820 --> 08:41.100]  police integrated with the regular police forces that have already been federalized
[08:41.100 --> 08:47.540]  and now with the new Stasi police, we're going to be facing within three years, eight
[08:47.540 --> 08:56.260]  million enforcers. They intend for you to revolt once they start squeezing. They are very arrogant
[08:56.260 --> 09:01.420]  and they know that things are going to then degrade. They will then say, see there's terrorism
[09:01.420 --> 09:08.100]  after enough families of other babies stolen and land taken and spit on and had their SUV
[09:08.100 --> 09:12.780]  tires slashed by the youth brigades. They're going to beat you up on the street. It is
[09:12.780 --> 09:18.940]  going to be bad. You think I'm joking? Everything else I told you is happening. They plan to
[09:18.940 --> 09:26.500]  murder you and your family. I can have top White House analysts, CIA commanders on. I
[09:26.500 --> 09:33.620]  can have economists, Nobel Prize winners. I can have all of them on. The father of Reaganomics,
[09:33.620 --> 09:38.820]  all of them who are experts on history to tell you this is going to happen. You understand
[09:38.820 --> 09:48.060]  and then it's stated in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act and it's stated in PDD 51.
[09:48.060 --> 09:53.700]  And why are they going to do it? Because they can. Why in history? 95 times out of 100 do
[09:53.700 --> 09:58.620]  governments end up doing this because criminals get in control and they don't just want to
[09:58.620 --> 10:04.180]  rob the bank. They want to tie the secretary up and rape her in the back. Criminals, you
[10:04.180 --> 10:08.820]  know, want to go out and grab a young girl off the road and take her in torture for days
[10:08.820 --> 10:14.220]  and kill her. It's what they like to do. You figure that out yet? And they know the young
[10:14.220 --> 10:18.220]  people are easily led and will get a taste for the blood and they're going to give them
[10:18.220 --> 10:29.100]  your blood. I mean, you to tell the police 10 years ago, I have federal documents and
[10:29.100 --> 10:32.980]  I'd show them and put them in the film. They're going to take all the high schoolers and turn
[10:32.980 --> 10:38.220]  them into secret police. And I'd have the cops walk by me at events and checkpoints
[10:38.220 --> 10:42.860]  and say, are the Serb soldiers going to get me Alex and start laughing? You know, are
[10:42.860 --> 10:47.300]  the space aliens going to get me? Now you tell the cop they're going to have youth
[10:47.300 --> 10:55.660]  brigades and they say, absolutely, that's good. Everything we were taught was bad.
[10:55.660 --> 10:59.940]  Everything history teaches us is bad. Presidential candidate wants domestic security force as
[10:59.940 --> 11:08.620]  powerful as US military. And even mainstream newspapers compare it to Hitler youth. Oh,
[11:08.620 --> 11:12.900]  but it can't be Hitler youth because they're going to have a black front man. That's right.
[11:12.900 --> 11:22.940]  And the black front man is going to run nothing. Just like George Bush. Doesn't matter if it's
[11:22.940 --> 11:27.420]  McCain and I know you, the audience, most of you know this better than I, but the public
[11:27.420 --> 11:31.380]  still doesn't understand this, that Bush is not going to be blamed for the wars and the
[11:31.380 --> 11:35.740]  tyranny and all of it. And then he's just handing the baton and the relay right over
[11:35.740 --> 11:40.580]  to the next guy. And it just continues on the same path, just a little bit different
[11:40.580 --> 11:47.420]  rhetoric. Yeah, the national no fly list, the terrorist list with well over a million
[11:47.420 --> 11:52.220]  people on it, the criminal databases, the person of interest databases with tens of
[11:52.220 --> 11:59.660]  millions on it, the checkpoints, all of it. Do you hear Obama saying he's going to get
[11:59.660 --> 12:02.780]  rid of Homeland Security? You hear McCain saying that? No, they're going to radically
[12:02.780 --> 12:09.700]  increase it because that's all the banks are going to find. There are entire colleges
[12:09.700 --> 12:15.380]  converting purely to Homeland Security in the last six years. And these people are
[12:15.380 --> 12:20.060]  going to have degrees and they're not going to just go quiet under the night. They're
[12:20.060 --> 12:29.100]  going to run our lives. And every day, the news intensifies every day, it gets worse
[12:29.100 --> 12:34.820]  and worse. Obama calls for national civilian Stasi. And then I've got this, this is out
[12:34.820 --> 12:47.100]  of NBC five out of Chicago. Governor on Wednesday signed a new law that will put in place tougher
[12:47.100 --> 12:52.420]  penalties for selling guns to minor C. This is gun related. He also announced he's got
[12:52.420 --> 12:57.300]  a new idea to help combat the violence that Chicago has experienced. He's talking to Illinois
[12:57.300 --> 13:02.020]  State Police, the National Guard to see if they can help getting rid of all jurisdictions
[13:02.020 --> 13:07.260]  under federal grants. And then you read the full story. And Governor Daley Mayor Daley
[13:07.260 --> 13:13.180]  says to the governor of Chicago that is Mayor Daley of Chicago says to the governor, I haven't
[13:13.180 --> 13:20.180]  seen your plan, but I signed on to it. That's that's in the piece. Now, what did they announce
[13:20.180 --> 13:24.980]  a few months ago? Oh, we're going to have police in black uniforms in Chicago, randomly
[13:24.980 --> 13:30.620]  searching you citywide and randomly searching your cars and homes without warrants for guns
[13:30.620 --> 13:35.780]  because guns are illegal in our city. So of course, it's a paradise of crime. All the
[13:35.780 --> 13:39.500]  criminals nationwide move there into New York and a few other places they don't like living
[13:39.500 --> 13:44.340]  in Vermont. I'll tell you that. And they know that the government, the social engineers
[13:44.340 --> 13:50.900]  know that. And so now it shows men in black ski mask and black helmets. You can go watch
[13:50.900 --> 13:54.180]  the newscast. We've played the audio here. We posted them on prison planet dot com and
[13:54.180 --> 14:01.420]  info wars dot com marching around all over the city, randomly searching people. And you
[14:01.420 --> 14:06.100]  go to New York City and you can be in Central Park. You can be in Times Square. You can
[14:06.100 --> 14:11.620]  be, I've seen tourists, not just me, videotaping things just, oh, wow, look at Times Square,
[14:11.620 --> 14:21.820]  honey, we're tourists and gang member. This is on video in the end game, gang member military
[14:21.820 --> 14:27.700]  run over and begin screaming and cussing and flashing gang signs at you. And then there
[14:27.700 --> 14:31.300]  was some other troops because they put them in groups. They put gang members in groups
[14:31.300 --> 14:37.020]  and they put retarded appellations. And I'm not saying that meanly. In fact, I'm tempted
[14:37.020 --> 14:40.620]  to go back in the video and show the groups of retarded appellations. And I don't mean
[14:40.620 --> 14:46.900]  that as a joke. I mean, they're actually retarded. I don't mean close to being retarded. I mean,
[14:46.900 --> 14:51.540]  these guys have too many chromosomes or missing chromosomes. And you would, and you would
[14:51.540 --> 14:56.980]  be in the subways and you would see groups of retarded troops. I mean, they actually,
[14:56.980 --> 15:01.340]  I'm not kidding. In fact, I, I, I, Rob wanted to put it in the film and I thought, no, that's
[15:01.340 --> 15:06.780]  a little too mean. And then now I start thinking about, no, people need to see. You see, the
[15:06.780 --> 15:12.500]  government's so mutated and so evil, they have groups of gang members, black gang members,
[15:12.500 --> 15:21.060]  and then they have groups of retarded appellations. And then I saw groups of Latin American clearly
[15:21.060 --> 15:27.060]  illegal aliens. Oh God, help us. It's all over. I mean, this is just too much. Who could have
[15:27.060 --> 15:32.340]  thought of this? It makes Kurt Vonnegut satire look ridiculous. It makes any police state
[15:32.340 --> 15:39.260]  satire ever written just totally off the chart. I mean, Homeland Security is proposing making
[15:39.260 --> 15:44.260]  us wear shock bracelets, all of us, then the entire population when we fly. I mean, it's
[15:44.260 --> 15:50.460]  all just, just insane. When cops start walking around at events in Austin, eight, nine years
[15:50.460 --> 15:58.700]  ago wearing black ski mask by the thousands, by the hundreds, we knew it was over. We told
[15:58.700 --> 16:03.700]  you it was for intimidation. And then police chiefs come out and say, yeah, it is for intimidation.
[16:03.700 --> 16:09.300]  We want to intimidate you, the people and let you know who's in control. And we're going
[16:09.300 --> 16:13.700]  to turn our appellation retarded children loose on you. And we're going to turn your
[16:13.700 --> 16:18.940]  teenagers loose on you with badges and guns and armbands. That's even being proposed.
[16:18.940 --> 16:31.180]  I mean, you can't make this stuff up. Armbands, badges. In London, they've put for now seven
[16:31.180 --> 16:36.380]  years giant billboards up everywhere saying big brother is watching with all seeing eyes.
[16:36.380 --> 16:42.740]  They even say big brother is watching you. I mean, they're actually implementing it.
[16:42.740 --> 16:49.820]  Do you understand me? You know what? I'm going to lay all this out, but let's just go ahead
[16:49.820 --> 16:54.900]  and play the NBC news piece. And of course, see first, it's National Guard to fight terrorists
[16:54.900 --> 16:59.380]  at key landmarks. And then, oh, as we told you, oh, they're going to fight gun crime
[16:59.380 --> 17:05.980]  now gun confiscation, New Orleans, other places. And then all over from Dallas to Denver to
[17:05.980 --> 17:16.940]  Cleveland to Phoenix to New York, Boston, Oakland, the police come to your door and
[17:16.940 --> 17:21.340]  say, we like to search for anything illegal. Oh, you don't mind. Yeah. And then they force
[17:21.340 --> 17:26.420]  their way in. They have cage teams. They call them the state police that are really federalized.
[17:26.420 --> 17:31.060]  I mean, these are terrorists, ladies and gentlemen in Illinois run by the mafia. The dailies
[17:31.060 --> 17:35.300]  are known mob, the whole state's mob run. What do you think bank robbers do when they
[17:35.300 --> 17:40.980]  come in and take over? They have guns. They make sure yours are taken. It's real simple.
[17:40.980 --> 17:44.500]  Red alert, ladies and gentlemen. Now they're getting everybody ready to get a bit of positive
[17:44.500 --> 17:48.100]  comment on us. They're getting everybody ready. And a lot of you good old boys that serve
[17:48.100 --> 17:52.780]  the system when you're getting hauled off to a camp by some 18 year olds with a squad
[17:52.780 --> 18:00.620]  of 16 year olds with them 16s. Just remember, I told you, you were the target in your red
[18:00.620 --> 18:05.760]  rage against Muslims. You accepted all of this thinking it was for blackie. It was for
[18:05.760 --> 18:12.580]  you dumb, whitey. Here it is. Governor Rob Lagojevic says that Chicago may need help
[18:12.580 --> 18:17.220]  in fighting crime. And today he offered some surprising help, even if Mayor Daly didn't
[18:17.220 --> 18:21.340]  ask for it. NBC five political reporter, Mary Ann Ahern has the latest
[18:21.340 --> 18:30.420]  news. Governor Rob Lagojevic today signs a new law. It will put in place tougher penalties
[18:30.420 --> 18:36.380]  for selling guns to minors. He also announces he's got a big new idea to help combat the
[18:36.380 --> 18:41.900]  violent Chicago is experiencing. He is talking to the Illinois state police and the National
[18:41.900 --> 18:46.740]  Guard to see if they can help and might be able to free up some resources that the Chicago
[18:46.740 --> 18:53.300]  police uses for capital needs to be able maybe to hire more police officers or possibly
[18:53.300 --> 18:58.860]  ask some to come out of retirement to put them into these violent zones, hot zones where
[18:58.860 --> 19:04.700]  clearly I think part of the challenge is that gang bangers outnumber police officers five
[19:04.700 --> 19:07.700]  to one. The summer of 2008 will be remembered as
[19:07.700 --> 19:12.700]  especially violent. Lagojevic says there's been a child shot in Chicago nearly every
[19:12.700 --> 19:19.300]  day since June 26th. Bringing in state troopers, even National Guard helicopters to high crime
[19:19.300 --> 19:24.700]  areas is still very much though in the planning stages. I don't care where they come from,
[19:24.700 --> 19:30.340]  they could come from Kalamazoo. If we get officers on the streets fighting crime, that's
[19:30.340 --> 19:33.220]  a good thing. There are way too many guns on the street
[19:33.220 --> 19:38.420]  and the police seem to be outmanned and so something needs to happen to protect the
[19:38.420 --> 19:44.340]  children, the women and children in our community. Lagojevic's offer is tied to his hope of passing
[19:44.340 --> 19:49.620]  a big capitol's funding bill that would free up even more resources to hire.
[19:49.620 --> 19:53.620]  You wonder how they introduce martial law? That's how they're going to do it, the children.
[19:53.620 --> 19:59.140]  May I have everybody's attention please? I've come with a message of information. 9-11
[19:59.140 --> 20:03.140]  was an inside job. Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet from the New
[20:03.140 --> 20:06.140]  World Order? How do the American people know that 9-11 was
[20:06.140 --> 20:10.140]  the state? It wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission,
[20:10.140 --> 20:16.140]  the CFR. Can we sit down and shout out? The day that we stop asking questions is the day
[20:16.140 --> 20:20.140]  that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[20:20.140 --> 20:26.140]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[20:26.140 --> 20:35.140]  An inside job? How dare you? If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held
[20:35.140 --> 20:39.140]  accountable for treason yourself. All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[20:39.140 --> 20:43.140]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th
[20:43.140 --> 21:11.140]  anniversary of that.
[21:11.140 --> 21:15.140]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the U.S. hinting
[21:15.140 --> 21:19.140]  liquidation of its vast holdings of U.S. treasuries, responding to Washington's trade
[21:19.140 --> 21:23.140]  sanctions forcing the Yan Revolution. Communist Party bodies are warning that Beijing may
[21:23.140 --> 21:28.140]  use its 1.33 trillion reserves as a political weapon causing bond yields to spike, hammering
[21:28.140 --> 21:32.140]  the U.S. housing market and throwing the economy into a recession. Russia, Switzerland, and
[21:32.140 --> 21:36.140]  several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat. Economist Ambrose
[21:36.140 --> 21:42.140]  Evans-Pritchard published the report China Threatens Nuclear Option of Dollar Sales.

[21:53.140 --> 21:58.140]  Do you still think that $4 a gallon at the gas pump is your worst problem in this country?
[21:58.140 --> 22:03.140]  Bank failures, rising food prices, and an ever weakening dollar are only the beginning of
[22:03.140 --> 22:09.140]  a much larger crisis. Why have America's politicians abandoned the rule of law in favor of the rule
[22:09.140 --> 22:14.140]  of men? The majority of this nation's elected officials have become drunk on the power and
[22:14.140 --> 22:19.140]  illusion of authority that only lawless men and women seek. They no longer strive to protect
[22:19.140 --> 22:24.140]  American ideals, but rather they have abandoned the very rulebook that they have sworn an oath
[22:24.140 --> 22:29.140]  to defend. Will the American people let these crimes go unpunished? Do the American people
[22:29.140 --> 22:33.140]  even understand the crimes that have been committed? Where does it stop?

[22:53.140 --> 22:57.140]  Hi, this is Alex Jones, and I want to talk to you about the high price of gasoline.
[22:57.140 --> 23:01.140]  It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor, even though we're paying record prices at
[23:01.140 --> 23:05.140]  the pump. I have run across a company called SFR, who has developed two products that
[23:05.140 --> 23:11.140]  improve gas mileage. Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300 to clean your injection system,
[23:11.140 --> 23:16.140]  protect a complete fuel system treatment, cleans to 95% of new engine condition,
[23:16.140 --> 23:21.140]  improving mileage in only one tank full. Protect an engine treatment not only reduces friction,
[23:21.140 --> 23:25.140]  but it extends the life of your engine. Let's face it, with the high price of gasoline,
[23:25.140 --> 23:30.140]  it's time to take action. Purchase a protective fuel system treatment for only $9.95,
[23:30.140 --> 23:35.140]  and receive a free engine treatment, which is a $12.95 value free.
[23:35.140 --> 23:40.140]  Call triple eight, use SFR 1. That number again is triple eight, use SFR 1,
[23:40.140 --> 23:46.140]  or check them out online at oilcompanysecret.com. That's oilcompanysecret.com.
[23:46.140 --> 23:57.140]  Satisfaction is guaranteed, or your money back, and it's safe for all cars. Act now.
[23:57.140 --> 24:04.140]  That entire newscast has lies, misrepresentations, distortion. They see a child eyes every day.
[24:04.140 --> 24:12.140]  That's a gangbanger who's under 18. That's the vast majority. They always distort those numbers.
[24:12.140 --> 24:20.140]  That's gangbangers killing each other.
[24:20.140 --> 24:25.140]  We do have a little bit more time to try to turn this around. The central government's being discredited.
[24:25.140 --> 24:30.140]  Their criminal activities becoming evident to everyone. They may not be able to carry this out,
[24:30.140 --> 24:38.140]  but see if they change horses to Obama especially, then they can kind of fool the left
[24:38.140 --> 24:43.140]  into accepting the police state a little longer while they fully get it in place.
[24:43.140 --> 24:47.140]  Does that fool the public? Oh, we've started new. It's Barack Obama.
[24:47.140 --> 24:49.140]  The more I think about it, I think that's who they'll try to put in.
[24:49.140 --> 24:55.140]  I saw him saying Hillary was the anointed one, and cheating for, and stealing states for,
[24:55.140 --> 25:02.140]  but then Obama didn't matter. The establishment gave the public what they wanted,
[25:02.140 --> 25:07.140]  and they're giving them Barack Obama, and it doesn't matter. We can obsess on him all day long.
[25:07.140 --> 25:13.140]  We can obsess on McCain. Either way, it means curtains for this republic.
[25:13.140 --> 25:20.140]  And you notice you've got this crime boss daily there in Chicago where they've disarmed the public for decades.
[25:20.140 --> 25:24.140]  He's a known son of a mob boss. The police are the mafia in Chicago.
[25:24.140 --> 25:28.140]  That's even mainstream knowledge and not debated.
[25:28.140 --> 25:33.140]  I mean, everybody's on the dole. I mean, the police come in and shake down.
[25:33.140 --> 25:39.140]  You don't have a mafia on the streets anymore there since the 50s because the police are the mob,
[25:39.140 --> 25:43.140]  and they pay it directly to the crime bosses, and they come in and you make payments to them,
[25:43.140 --> 25:49.140]  and that's just well-known, and now police beat women up and rape them in the bars in front of everyone,
[25:49.140 --> 25:58.140]  and nothing's done. I mean, they are God. They rule, and that's the end of it, period.
[25:58.140 --> 26:00.140]  And that's what America's going to be.
[26:00.140 --> 26:06.140]  And if you don't like it, they're going to call a bunch of high schoolers with machine guns over to your house to burn it down.
[26:06.140 --> 26:12.140]  And they're going to have also auxiliaries that are like volunteer terrorists, volunteer fire department,
[26:12.140 --> 26:15.140]  that's kind of what the Maoists are, and these youth brigades,
[26:15.140 --> 26:18.140]  and they're just going to be allowed to beat you to death and burn you out,
[26:18.140 --> 26:20.140]  and the police will sit there and wink and laugh.
[26:20.140 --> 26:28.140]  You think I'm joking about all this? They're following every point of tyranny.
[26:28.140 --> 26:31.140]  We told you they were going to announce because of terrorism,
[26:31.140 --> 26:34.140]  they needed to put troops on the streets that they would stage a terror event.
[26:34.140 --> 26:42.140]  I said that for year after year after year, made films about it, warned you, made police state 2000 in 1999,
[26:42.140 --> 26:46.140]  saying the government would stage terror attacks to take your liberties.
[26:46.140 --> 26:51.140]  And I didn't start predicting 9-11 a few months before 9-11.
[26:51.140 --> 26:57.140]  That's all I talked about was government-sponsored terror, because I realized that was their key operation.
[26:57.140 --> 27:01.140]  That was one of their most effective cards, effective plays,
[27:01.140 --> 27:06.140]  that they were getting touchdowns against the Republic every single time they ran it.
[27:06.140 --> 27:11.140]  Now, we've done a good job of exposing false flag, but we've got a lot more to do here.
[27:11.140 --> 27:14.140]  We're in the fight of our lives.
[27:14.140 --> 27:16.140]  This isn't some soft tyranny.
[27:16.140 --> 27:23.140]  They mean to have a Bolshevik slash Nazi-style purge in England and in the United States and Europe.
[27:23.140 --> 27:27.140]  We've got a bunch of mainstream news today admitting that they're taking all liberties, total police state,
[27:27.140 --> 27:30.140]  arresting people for speech in Europe and England.
[27:30.140 --> 27:32.140]  It's being called the New Soviet Union.
[27:32.140 --> 27:34.140]  You understand this isn't a game.
[27:34.140 --> 27:36.140]  They're going to kill you.
[27:36.140 --> 27:40.140]  That's what they do.
[27:40.140 --> 27:42.140]  The same central bankers funded the Bolsheviks.
[27:42.140 --> 27:44.140]  They funded the Nazis.
[27:44.140 --> 27:48.140]  They want to destroy freedom forever.
[27:48.140 --> 27:52.140]  They are coming with a 1984 system.
[27:52.140 --> 27:59.140]  They are here, finished playing the mob boss mayor and the mob boss governor there in Illinois.
[27:59.140 --> 28:01.140]  Listen to the evil.
[28:01.140 --> 28:05.140]  And so something needs to happen to protect the children, the women and children in our community.
[28:05.140 --> 28:10.140]  Bogorjevic's offer is tied to his hope of passing a big capital spending bill.
[28:10.140 --> 28:15.140]  That would free up even more resources to hire additional police.
[28:15.140 --> 28:19.140]  There are retired Chicago police officers, there are retired Illinois state troopers
[28:19.140 --> 28:22.140]  who might be willing and probably would be willing to get back in it
[28:22.140 --> 28:25.140]  and be helpful to the community during this difficult time.
[28:25.140 --> 28:32.140]  The mayor's office says tonight we're obviously not going to turn away help on a front as important as this
[28:32.140 --> 28:35.140]  at the same time we're a little puzzled about how it would work.
[28:35.140 --> 28:40.140]  It's unprecedented and obviously help in the form of reducing the number of guns on the street
[28:40.140 --> 28:43.140]  would go a long way to addressing the problem.
[28:43.140 --> 28:47.140]  That is from the mayor's books when Jackie heard but you know this is just in the planning stages.
[28:47.140 --> 28:53.140]  No one's going to say no just yet but it's probably still a long way from putting it into action.
[28:53.140 --> 28:55.140]  That whole thing was government written.
[28:55.140 --> 28:56.140]  It's always, it's just in the planning.
[28:56.140 --> 28:57.140]  Don't get upset.
[28:57.140 --> 28:58.140]  It's preliminary.
[28:58.140 --> 29:01.140]  They probably interviewed 100 people on the street that didn't like it.
[29:01.140 --> 29:02.140]  They found two that did.
[29:02.140 --> 29:03.140]  Put them on the news.
[29:03.140 --> 29:04.140]  It's for the children.
[29:04.140 --> 29:06.140]  Hey, whatever you want to do.
[29:06.140 --> 29:12.140]  They had probably government spokesmen posing as a public just saying whatever you want, whatever you want.
[29:12.140 --> 29:13.140]  You'll always see that the newscast.
[29:13.140 --> 29:18.140]  Whatever you say, you heard it, military to be used in anti-gun sweeps.
[29:18.140 --> 29:20.140]  That's what the program is.
[29:20.140 --> 29:22.140]  I've got the mayor's full press release.
[29:22.140 --> 29:24.140]  The military to be used.
[29:24.140 --> 29:29.140]  And of course they let in the MS-13 gang bangers fighting with the black gangs.
[29:29.140 --> 29:33.140]  They call all the people under 18 getting killed, gang bangers, children.
[29:33.140 --> 29:38.140]  And then you, the old 87-year-old World War II veteran that's in the news all the time,
[29:38.140 --> 29:41.140]  you're going to get SWAT team rated.
[29:41.140 --> 29:43.140]  You're going to have your house seized.
[29:43.140 --> 29:45.140]  We're on the march.
[29:45.140 --> 29:47.140]  The Empire's on the run.

[33:29.140 --> 33:32.140]  He's haunted by something he cannot define.
[33:32.140 --> 33:35.140]  Bowel shaking earthquakes of doubt and remorse.
[33:35.140 --> 33:37.140]  I sail him and bail him with master truck force.
[33:37.140 --> 33:40.140]  In his mind he's still driving, still making the grade.
[33:40.140 --> 33:42.140]  She's hoping in time that her memories will fade.
[33:42.140 --> 33:45.140]  Cause he's racing and pacing and parting the course.
[33:45.140 --> 33:48.140]  He's fighting and fighting and riding on his horse.
[33:48.140 --> 33:51.140]  The sun has gone down and the moon has come up.
[33:51.140 --> 33:53.140]  And long ago somebody left with the cup.
[33:53.140 --> 33:56.140]  But he's driving and driving and hugging the turns.
[33:56.140 --> 33:59.140]  A thinking of someone for whom he still burns.
[33:59.140 --> 34:02.140]  Cause he's going the distance.
[34:02.140 --> 34:05.140]  He's going for speed.
[34:05.140 --> 34:07.140]  She's all alone.
[34:07.140 --> 34:10.140]  All alone in a time of need.
[34:10.140 --> 34:14.140]  Because he's racing and pacing and parting the course.
[34:14.140 --> 34:17.140]  He's fighting and bonding and riding on his horse.
[34:17.140 --> 34:19.140]  He's racing and pacing and parting the course.
[34:19.140 --> 34:22.140]  He's fighting and bonding and riding on his horse.
[34:22.140 --> 34:25.140]  He's going the distance.
[34:25.140 --> 34:28.140]  He's going for speed.
[34:28.140 --> 34:30.140]  He's going the distance.
[34:30.140 --> 34:52.140]  All alone in a time of need.
[34:52.140 --> 34:55.140]  All right ladies and gentlemen.
[34:55.140 --> 34:58.140]  We had William Pepper.
[34:58.140 --> 35:01.140]  He's a lawyer to JFK.
[35:01.140 --> 35:03.140]  The list goes on and on.
[35:03.140 --> 35:09.140]  He's in a bunch of depositions trying to expose the murder of JFK, MLK, RFK.
[35:09.140 --> 35:10.140]  I canceled him.
[35:10.140 --> 35:12.140]  This martial law news is too important.
[35:12.140 --> 35:16.140]  He's coming on next week and I appreciate him moving to next week.
[35:16.140 --> 35:20.140]  Tex Mars is going to be in studio in about 30 minutes.
[35:20.140 --> 35:24.140]  And we've got Academy Award-winning filmmaker Eva Orner about Taxi the Dark Side.
[35:24.140 --> 35:27.140]  What really goes on in the torture camps and her film.
[35:27.140 --> 35:30.140]  That is just now coming out about Hunter S. Thompson.
[35:30.140 --> 35:33.140]  Who was getting ready to go public about 9-11 being an inside job.
[35:33.140 --> 35:35.140]  Did radio interviews saying it.
[35:35.140 --> 35:38.140]  And he was working on a story about Bush and pedophile rings.
[35:38.140 --> 35:41.140]  So they dealt with him real fast, real quick.
[35:41.140 --> 35:45.140]  So she is in the last 30 minutes of the show today.
[35:45.140 --> 35:50.140]  But I can't even talk about how they murdered RFK, MLK and JFK today.
[35:50.140 --> 35:52.140]  Though I meant to because it's just what's going on.
[35:52.140 --> 35:55.140]  It's too big.
[35:55.140 --> 36:00.140]  Let me recap and give you the basics here.
[36:00.140 --> 36:06.140]  You have a private military industrial complex that is owned by the private families
[36:06.140 --> 36:11.140]  that control the central banks of Europe and the United States.
[36:11.140 --> 36:15.140]  There's only a handful of nations worldwide that they do not financially control.
[36:15.140 --> 36:17.140]  They own our Congress.
[36:17.140 --> 36:19.140]  They own the presidency.
[36:19.140 --> 36:22.140]  They control most state governments through federal standardization
[36:22.140 --> 36:26.140]  and international treaty agreements.
[36:26.140 --> 36:34.140]  They are attempting to preemptively set up a high-tech control grid
[36:34.140 --> 36:39.140]  complete with spies on every corner, doctors by law having a spy on you.
[36:39.140 --> 36:42.140]  Everything you're doing being tracked, neighbors spying.
[36:42.140 --> 36:46.140]  Your children have already for a decade been taken away from you in public schools.
[36:46.140 --> 36:52.140]  Now entire semester classes at the most formative sixth, seventh and eighth grade nationwide,
[36:52.140 --> 36:54.140]  openly on videotape.
[36:54.140 --> 36:55.140]  They don't even hide it.
[36:55.140 --> 36:59.140]  Training your children to spy on you, to watch you, to see if you have marijuana,
[36:59.140 --> 37:01.140]  to read the pill bottles.
[37:01.140 --> 37:04.140]  I mean, to see if mom and dad's names are on them.
[37:04.140 --> 37:06.140]  I mean, it is hellish.
[37:06.140 --> 37:08.140]  It is classical tyranny.
[37:08.140 --> 37:10.140]  They have openly built FEMA camps.
[37:10.140 --> 37:11.140]  It is not rumor.
[37:11.140 --> 37:12.140]  It is on the Army's own website.
[37:12.140 --> 37:13.140]  They are proud of it.
[37:13.140 --> 37:17.140]  U.S. citizens are in forced labor camps right now.
[37:17.140 --> 37:20.140]  That's the civilian inmate labor camp program in my book,
[37:20.140 --> 37:23.140]  The Sentent to Tyranny, published in 2002.
[37:23.140 --> 37:28.140]  In my film, Road to Tyranny, 2002.
[37:28.140 --> 37:30.140]  It is, now it's Houston Chronicle.
[37:30.140 --> 37:36.140]  Now it's all over the place.
[37:36.140 --> 37:44.140]  Under Rex 84, they wanted to recruit and turn the high schools into military schools.
[37:44.140 --> 37:48.140]  But the military itself is in a massive buildup against the American people.
[37:48.140 --> 37:51.140]  The police are being merged with the military,
[37:51.140 --> 37:55.140]  and there is a huge paramilitary buildup against the American people.
[37:55.140 --> 38:01.140]  Sound cannons, microwave guns, helicopters with opiate knockout tanks,
[38:01.140 --> 38:05.140]  to spray the cities, declassified.
[38:05.140 --> 38:11.140]  World War II, President of War camps for Japanese, Germans, and Italians reopened.
[38:11.140 --> 38:15.140]  Just the Internet operation to control and shut down the web,
[38:15.140 --> 38:22.140]  this is declassified this year, is 45 times bigger than the Manhattan Project.
[38:22.140 --> 38:24.140]  I mean, that's one program.
[38:24.140 --> 38:29.140]  The entire energy of the banks, the military, the government, the police,
[38:29.140 --> 38:33.140]  is fully to dominate the American people.
[38:33.140 --> 38:35.140]  Now, you say, why are they doing that?
[38:35.140 --> 38:36.140]  We've put up with so much.
[38:36.140 --> 38:38.140]  We've gone along with so much.
[38:38.140 --> 38:42.140]  They already grabbed 1.4 million children a year with no due process.
[38:42.140 --> 38:44.140]  They already are building prisons.
[38:44.140 --> 38:48.140]  There's already 7 million people plus in the system, 4 million behind bars,
[38:48.140 --> 38:51.140]  more than any other country in the world.
[38:51.140 --> 38:58.140]  They are already just taxing us in hundreds of new taxes and regulations and police everywhere.
[38:58.140 --> 39:03.140]  And then selectively enforcing, hiring illegal aliens, felons,
[39:03.140 --> 39:07.140]  all these classical forms of tyranny into the military and police forces.
[39:07.140 --> 39:09.140]  I tell you that 10 years ago and it was secret now.
[39:09.140 --> 39:11.140]  It's all public telling you how great it is.
[39:11.140 --> 39:13.140]  And they get citizens on the news going, you know what?
[39:13.140 --> 39:16.140]  If it fights crime, these felons have paid their due.
[39:16.140 --> 39:18.140]  I think it's great.
[39:18.140 --> 39:22.140]  Hey, if the Army is going to be in here confiscating guns, door to door in Chicago,
[39:22.140 --> 39:23.140]  I think it's great.
[39:23.140 --> 39:24.140]  I mean, you just heard that.
[39:24.140 --> 39:28.140]  Now I think whatever we got to do to keep our children safe.
[39:28.140 --> 39:37.140]  I displayed you NBC5, WMAQ saying that in Chicago.
[39:37.140 --> 39:43.140]  As we analyze that propaganda piece,
[39:43.140 --> 39:45.140]  they're really doing it.
[39:45.140 --> 39:48.140]  And every time they plunge the dollar, every time they increase food prices,
[39:48.140 --> 39:52.140]  every time they lower the borders, every time they get ready to attack another country,
[39:52.140 --> 39:55.140]  it just means they're following their battle plan.
[39:55.140 --> 40:03.140]  They're following the program operation that they told us they would.
[40:03.140 --> 40:08.140]  I mean, there's so many people marveling now all over YouTube, all over Google,
[40:08.140 --> 40:10.140]  all over the web, message boards.
[40:10.140 --> 40:13.140]  How did Alex Jones know they were going to attack the World Trade Centers?
[40:13.140 --> 40:16.140]  How did Alex Jones know they'd be provocateurs in Seattle in 99?
[40:16.140 --> 40:21.140]  How did he know there'd be provocateurs in Montabello in 2007?
[40:21.140 --> 40:25.140]  How did he know that gas would be at this price?
[40:25.140 --> 40:29.140]  How did he must be an agent?
[40:29.140 --> 40:31.140]  No, my friends.
[40:31.140 --> 40:36.140]  I have read the Rand Corporation documents, the British Ministry of Defense documents,
[40:36.140 --> 40:39.140]  the Pentagon Army War College, Naval War College documents.
[40:39.140 --> 40:40.140]  We have posted them.
[40:40.140 --> 40:41.140]  We have linked them.
[40:41.140 --> 40:47.140]  We have had government expert, former Jag Generals, judge advocate generals.
[40:47.140 --> 40:51.140]  We've had admirals, former chairman, joint chiefs of staff.
[40:51.140 --> 40:55.140]  We've had members of parliament, German defense ministers.
[40:55.140 --> 40:57.140]  We've had sociologists.
[40:57.140 --> 41:01.140]  We've had top experts on death squads from the Smithsonian on.
[41:01.140 --> 41:05.140]  This is a college of real research and understanding.
[41:05.140 --> 41:12.140]  That's why we know the enemy has such a big operation, they have to lay it out.
[41:12.140 --> 41:15.140]  We also have a lot of good people on the inside.
[41:15.140 --> 41:21.140]  September 10th, the Washington Post has an article where the U.S. military comes out
[41:21.140 --> 41:26.140]  and says Israel may stage terror attacks to blame it on their enemies inside the U.S.
[41:26.140 --> 41:31.140]  in the near future to get us to attack Iraq.
[41:31.140 --> 41:34.140]  That was a warning out of the Pentagon.
[41:34.140 --> 41:36.140]  Washington Post slipped out.
[41:36.140 --> 41:41.140]  Operation Northwoods wasn't supposed to be declassified, but it was released.
[41:41.140 --> 41:43.140]  Then, of course, they reclassified.
[41:43.140 --> 41:48.140]  That was pushed out to the public, the plan to carry out 9-11.
[41:48.140 --> 41:50.140]  Do you understand this is life and death?
[41:50.140 --> 41:52.140]  These people carried out 9-11.
[41:52.140 --> 41:57.140]  The Anglo-American establishment, the Axis of Evil, MI6, CIA, and Mossad.
[41:57.140 --> 42:01.140]  Do you understand that they are not backing off?
[42:01.140 --> 42:02.140]  They're not going to give up.
[42:02.140 --> 42:08.140]  These are true, quote, tradition of the swashbucklers, but they're devils.
[42:08.140 --> 42:11.140]  James Bond, the image of the good guy.
[42:11.140 --> 42:14.140]  No, James Bond is real, but he's a devil.
[42:14.140 --> 42:18.140]  He's a terrorist.
[42:18.140 --> 42:21.140]  He's, therefore, corrupt interests that are in power
[42:21.140 --> 42:23.140]  because they're more ruthless than anyone else on the earth.
[42:23.140 --> 42:25.140]  They're more duplicitous.
[42:25.140 --> 42:27.140]  Do you understand that?
[42:27.140 --> 42:29.140]  And now you have Barack Obama come out and say,
[42:29.140 --> 42:45.140]  I want one million high schoolers to engage in security force operations and surveillance in America armed, bigger than the armed forces.
[42:45.140 --> 42:47.140]  Now, understand it's nonpartisan.
[42:47.140 --> 42:48.140]  Don't just hate Obama.
[42:48.140 --> 42:49.140]  Hate him.
[42:49.140 --> 42:50.140]  Absolutely distrust him.
[42:50.140 --> 42:52.140]  Dislike him, but you better know McCain's proposed the same thing.
[42:52.140 --> 42:54.140]  You better know Clinton proposed it.
[42:54.140 --> 42:58.140]  You better know it started with Olly North.
[42:58.140 --> 43:01.140]  It is nonpartisan.
[43:01.140 --> 43:06.140]  Presidential candidate wants domestic security force as powerful as U.S. military.
[43:06.140 --> 43:11.140]  Colonist compares himself to Hitler youth.
[43:11.140 --> 43:15.140]  Colonist prepares and compares proposal to Hitler youth.
[43:15.140 --> 43:19.140]  Presidential front runner Barack Obama has called for civilian national security force.
[43:19.140 --> 43:24.140]  That is the quote, a civilian national security force.
[43:24.140 --> 43:29.140]  And you just think, oh, this new idea, you know, the governor of Illinois just had this new idea.
[43:29.140 --> 43:35.140]  While police all over the country are getting grants for warrantless blood taps, samples on the side of the street,
[43:35.140 --> 43:39.140]  while they're hiring felons while they're doing door-to-door gun confiscations.
[43:39.140 --> 43:42.140]  He just magically got this idea and it turns out it's a federal grant.
[43:42.140 --> 43:47.140]  And then Obama just magically comes up with an idea that's already been put into motion.
[43:47.140 --> 43:53.140]  They're just now letting you know of a million plus Hitler-Yugan to plug into this.
[43:53.140 --> 43:58.140]  And can you imagine these surly, well, the program goes down to 14-year-olds,
[43:58.140 --> 44:01.140]  but they're not going to arm them until 16 and up.
[44:01.140 --> 44:03.140]  They're training them with M16s.
[44:03.140 --> 44:10.140]  You can't have your gun, veterans, but believe me, this 16-year-old with the M16-ish.
[44:10.140 --> 44:12.140]  And it's called Secure Corps.
[44:12.140 --> 44:14.140]  It's been in the Philadelphia Daily News.
[44:14.140 --> 44:15.140]  It's been in a bunch of other papers.
[44:15.140 --> 44:16.140]  It's in my films.
[44:16.140 --> 44:17.140]  Police State 3.
[44:17.140 --> 44:19.140]  Total enslavement has that in it.
[44:19.140 --> 44:21.140]  And it's already set up.
[44:21.140 --> 44:23.140]  So they tell the kids, you can't have guns.
[44:23.140 --> 44:24.140]  Your parents can't have guns.
[44:24.140 --> 44:29.140]  But when you're part of the local homeland security group, you can.
[44:29.140 --> 44:34.140]  And then now mom and dad have got a grovel of their son who comes home in the black uniform.
[44:34.140 --> 44:38.140]  Now actual, the actual adults have black uniforms.
[44:38.140 --> 44:46.140]  According to the federal proposals and the plans, the youth will wear gray uniforms with a blue armband.
[44:46.140 --> 44:47.140]  You can go dig those out.
[44:47.140 --> 44:49.140]  I cover that in Police State 2000.
[44:49.140 --> 44:56.140]  And look, I'm not going to have some bastard 16-year-old in a gray uniform with a blue armband come up.
[44:56.140 --> 44:57.140]  And I mean, that's it.
[44:57.140 --> 44:59.140]  That's my line of the scene.
[44:59.140 --> 45:00.140]  Okay?
[45:00.140 --> 45:04.140]  I mean, I just can't handle it anymore.
[45:04.140 --> 45:06.140]  And it's over.
[45:06.140 --> 45:07.140]  Okay?
[45:07.140 --> 45:08.140]  I don't care what you say.
[45:08.140 --> 45:12.140]  You criminal government with all your legal alien felons working for you.
[45:12.140 --> 45:15.140]  You are a pack of drug dealing, scum and trash.
[45:15.140 --> 45:17.140]  And all the other cops and military who aren't criminal.
[45:17.140 --> 45:19.140]  You still work for a criminal enterprise.
[45:19.140 --> 45:21.140]  Your commanders are criminals.
[45:21.140 --> 45:22.140]  It's bankrupt.
[45:22.140 --> 45:23.140]  The country's gone.
[45:23.140 --> 45:24.140]  Declaration of Independence.
[45:24.140 --> 45:25.140]  You're crooks.
[45:25.140 --> 45:26.140]  You don't control us.
[45:26.140 --> 45:27.140]  You're illegitimate.
[45:27.140 --> 45:28.140]  Period.
[45:28.140 --> 45:30.140]  And you better decide to join us right now.
[45:30.140 --> 45:33.140]  I mean, my God, look at all the examples there are.
[45:33.140 --> 45:34.140]  It couldn't be any more plain.
[45:34.140 --> 45:36.140]  This is satirical.
[45:36.140 --> 45:39.140]  This is like Monty Python skit on the police state.
[45:39.140 --> 45:42.140]  This is just so over the top.
[45:42.140 --> 45:43.140]  But don't worry.
[45:43.140 --> 45:46.140]  They'll phase it in real slow for you.
[45:46.140 --> 45:48.140]  Presidential front runner Barack Obama has called for his
[45:48.140 --> 45:51.140]  civilian national security force as powerful as the US military.
[45:51.140 --> 45:52.140]  That's a quote.
[45:52.140 --> 45:56.140]  Comments that were ignored by the vast majority of the corporate media,
[45:56.140 --> 45:59.140]  but compared by one journalist to the Nazi Hitler youth.
[45:59.140 --> 46:01.140]  We cannot continue to rely on our military in order to enhance the
[46:01.140 --> 46:02.140]  national security objectives.
[46:02.140 --> 46:06.140]  We said we've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as
[46:06.140 --> 46:09.140]  powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[46:09.140 --> 46:12.140]  Obama told the Colorado Springs audience earlier this month.
[46:12.140 --> 46:16.140]  Joseph Farah asked if he was the only journalist in America who Obama's
[46:16.140 --> 46:18.140]  statement troubling.
[46:18.140 --> 46:21.140]  Well, you didn't seem to find it bad when Bush was setting all this up, Farah.
[46:21.140 --> 46:23.140]  You're not stupid.
[46:23.140 --> 46:25.140]  You thought it was popular to go along with it.
[46:25.140 --> 46:27.140]  Now you're changing your spots again.
[46:27.140 --> 46:28.140]  Fine.
[46:28.140 --> 46:29.140]  Join us later.
[46:29.140 --> 46:31.140]  I mean, now rather than later.
[46:31.140 --> 46:32.140]  Fine.
[46:32.140 --> 46:33.140]  I forgive you.
[46:33.140 --> 46:37.140]  But don't flip flop if McCain gets in and suddenly love it all.
[46:37.140 --> 46:38.140]  Does it matter?
[46:38.140 --> 46:41.140]  They're puppets.
[46:41.140 --> 46:43.140]  You understand it's like a horse and carriage.
[46:43.140 --> 46:44.140]  This thing is all seamless.
[46:44.140 --> 46:46.140]  It has nothing to do with presidents.
[46:46.140 --> 46:50.140]  They run or are in control of nothing.
[46:50.140 --> 46:53.140]  I know I keep making that point because the general public doesn't understand.
[46:53.140 --> 46:57.140]  The liberals who've been hating all of Bush's police state are suddenly just
[46:57.140 --> 47:00.140]  going to love it and go get in these uniforms.
[47:00.140 --> 47:03.140]  And yes, I've already seen the video of it.
[47:03.140 --> 47:06.140]  It's going to be little liberals with ponytails and police uniforms.
[47:06.140 --> 47:09.140]  I'm going to have to take you to the camp for your own good.
[47:09.140 --> 47:10.140]  It's for the earth.
[47:10.140 --> 47:11.140]  Yeah.
[47:11.140 --> 47:13.140]  Well, just get ready, punk.
[47:13.140 --> 47:19.140]  If we're going to create some kind of national police force as big, powerful, and well-funded
[47:19.140 --> 47:24.140]  as our combined U.S. military forces, isn't it rather a big deal, wrote Farah?
[47:24.140 --> 47:27.140]  We're talking about creating a police state here.
[47:27.140 --> 47:29.140]  The U.S. Army alone has 500,000 troops.
[47:29.140 --> 47:31.140]  That doesn't count reserves or national guard.
[47:31.140 --> 47:36.140]  I know seven in the U.S. defense budget was 439 billion.
[47:36.140 --> 47:41.140]  Is Obama serious about creating some kind of domestic security bigger and more expensive
[47:41.140 --> 47:42.140]  than that?
[47:42.140 --> 47:43.140]  If not, why did he say it?
[47:43.140 --> 47:44.140]  What did he mean?
[47:44.140 --> 47:46.140]  Hey, Farah, you're not stupid.
[47:46.140 --> 47:51.140]  You published articles I put together and photos I made of Delta Force and martial law training
[47:51.140 --> 47:53.140]  in 98 and 99.
[47:53.140 --> 47:56.140]  You know that it isn't Obama proposing this.
[47:56.140 --> 47:59.140]  You know this is part of a larger plan.
[47:59.140 --> 48:04.140]  So see, by saying Obama's behind it, it's all just Obama that's doing it.
[48:04.140 --> 48:06.140]  Oh, it's just a proposal.
[48:06.140 --> 48:08.140]  No, it's an organized program.
[48:08.140 --> 48:12.140]  It's an organized military buildup against the people of the United States.
[48:12.140 --> 48:15.140]  And it's happening in Europe and England as well.
[48:15.140 --> 48:17.140]  Ireland said no to being taken over by the EU.
[48:17.140 --> 48:19.140]  Sarkozy said, doesn't matter.
[48:19.140 --> 48:21.140]  We're going to go ahead and enforce it.
[48:21.140 --> 48:25.140]  We're going to make you vote again until you get it right.
[48:25.140 --> 48:31.140]  Knoxville News is seemingly the only other media outlet to express interest in exactly
[48:31.140 --> 48:34.140]  what Obama is proposing.
[48:34.140 --> 48:37.140]  The statement was made in a context of youth service.
[48:37.140 --> 48:42.140]  Is this an organization for just the youth or adults going to participate?
[48:42.140 --> 48:46.140]  How does one get away from the specter of such youth organizations from Nazi Germany
[48:46.140 --> 48:49.140]  and the former Soviet Union we're talking about?
[48:49.140 --> 48:52.140]  Remember, they hired the former Marcus Wolf, the head of the Stasi,
[48:52.140 --> 48:54.140]  six years ago to help set this up.
[48:54.140 --> 48:55.140]  That was Bush.
[48:55.140 --> 48:57.140]  It has nothing to do with Obama or Bush.
[48:57.140 --> 49:00.140]  They're puppets.
[49:00.140 --> 49:04.140]  So Obama's proposal smacks of an existing version of an existing program
[49:04.140 --> 49:07.140]  in which hundreds of police firefighters, paramedics, utility workers have been trained
[49:07.140 --> 49:10.140]  and recently dispatched as terrorism liaison officers.
[49:10.140 --> 49:11.140]  That was the Colorado News.
[49:11.140 --> 49:13.140]  It's actually tens of thousands.
[49:13.140 --> 49:18.140]  And 26,000 preachers trained to spy and tattle and to tell their flocks to turn in their guns.
[49:18.140 --> 49:22.140]  And 23,000 under the infraguard executives.
[49:22.140 --> 49:27.140]  And 500,000 in the first batch of truck drivers spying on everyone.
[49:27.140 --> 49:31.140]  So see how when you read a World Net Daily article, it just gives you little pieces,
[49:31.140 --> 49:34.140]  just like the news gives you little pieces, but you put them together.
[49:34.140 --> 49:40.140]  And it's a clear picture and then you go get the White House continuity government plans
[49:40.140 --> 49:42.140]  and it says it.
[49:42.140 --> 49:47.140]  And then they got their boys, like the dirty beatnik, Michael Savage posing as a conservative,
[49:47.140 --> 49:51.140]  saying put people who disagree with the war and forced labor camps.
[49:51.140 --> 49:55.140]  They're going to bring Obama or they're going to bring McCain in and then they're going to set a nuke off
[49:55.140 --> 49:57.140]  where they're going to release a biological weapon.
[49:57.140 --> 50:00.140]  And then those murdering bastards are going to sit up there on the news
[50:00.140 --> 50:04.140]  and the police and the military are going to follow the orders with their new ranks of mercenaries
[50:04.140 --> 50:06.140]  and felons and teenagers.
[50:06.140 --> 50:11.140]  And they are going to ratchet up and they're going to take over the entire society
[50:11.140 --> 50:15.140]  unless we warn everybody now about what they're going to do.
[50:15.140 --> 50:17.140]  Let me tell you something good, old boys.
[50:17.140 --> 50:20.140]  You've been serving this and flying a flag out front of your house.
[50:20.140 --> 50:25.140]  You are going to be arrested, it may take two years, five years into this system.
[50:25.140 --> 50:27.140]  You're going to have your stuff taken.
[50:27.140 --> 50:31.140]  Now a lot of you are cowards and are going to go try to join it.
[50:31.140 --> 50:36.140]  Now because you know I'm telling you the truth, well you're going to go try to boot lick.
[50:36.140 --> 50:37.140]  We can't forget that.
[50:37.140 --> 50:41.140]  A lot of people hear this and know it's true, so they just decide to go join it.
[50:41.140 --> 50:43.140]  You go ahead and join it.
[50:43.140 --> 50:46.140]  When we take this country back, you are going to be brought to justice.
[50:46.140 --> 50:50.140]  You understand you're going to get a jury trial and then you're going to swing from the end of a rope.
[50:50.140 --> 50:52.140]  You traitors.
[50:54.140 --> 50:58.140]  Have you ever suffered from giardia, food poisoning, heavy metal poisoning,
[50:58.140 --> 51:00.140]  arthritis, fatigue, or high cholesterol?
[51:00.140 --> 51:04.140]  Maybe you're one of the 75 million Americans at the Center for Disease Control
[51:04.140 --> 51:07.140]  reports of suffering from internal parasites.
[51:07.140 --> 51:11.140]  If so, Freshwater Organics is proud to introduce you to a million year old miracle

[51:48.140 --> 51:52.140]  That's 888-949-3570.
[51:52.140 --> 51:58.140]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero,
[51:58.140 --> 52:02.140]  and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[52:02.140 --> 52:09.140]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[52:09.140 --> 52:18.140]  Whitman, EVA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[52:18.140 --> 52:25.140]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[52:25.140 --> 52:28.140]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting the countdown.
[52:28.140 --> 52:34.140]  He takes his hand off, and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[52:34.140 --> 52:41.140]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide. Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv

[54:18.140 --> 54:23.140]  They liken themselves to trophy hunters.
[54:23.140 --> 54:27.140]  And in the jungle, the biggest, baddest trophy.
[54:27.140 --> 54:32.140]  The greatest spoils is the United States.
[54:32.140 --> 54:36.140]  They've seized control for decades of the central government.
[54:36.140 --> 54:44.140]  They have used this country's treasure, its credit, its soldiers, to dominate the world.
[54:44.140 --> 54:52.140]  And now, their own think tanks say they're losing control, so they're going to clamp down and murder millions of us
[54:52.140 --> 55:00.140]  and use us as a military district to supply cannon fodder to the European Union Force.
[55:00.140 --> 55:07.140]  They will dominate the planetary government.
[55:07.140 --> 55:16.140]  The socialist enforcers, the environmental police, will inspect your home weekly, will run your entire life.
[55:16.140 --> 55:25.140]  You will live and die under feudalism tied to your World ID card, tracking your carbon credits.
[55:25.140 --> 55:32.140]  If your children are one pound overweight, they will be taken to government reeducation camps.
[55:32.140 --> 55:40.140]  Long after I'm gone when you're living under this, I want you to remember, I told you the truth.
[55:40.140 --> 55:56.140]  I want you to remember that you can resist even in the darkest of times, even if the enemy is able to go to the next level of the grid.
[55:56.140 --> 56:05.140]  And I will tell the enforcers out there, you will rationalize and you will deceive yourself.
[56:05.140 --> 56:13.140]  But as things get worse and worse and years from now, when you remember me and remember the information I and others gave you,
[56:13.140 --> 56:19.140]  you will then understand that you were wrong and that you were part of a great evil.
[56:19.140 --> 56:22.140]  And then perhaps you will fight back.
[56:22.140 --> 56:30.140]  Then perhaps humanity can start over again with some chance of decency and dignity and honor.
[56:30.140 --> 56:38.140]  For this I pledge my name, my honor, my treasure, my blood, my soul.
[56:38.140 --> 56:46.140]  We are the Sons of Liberty in 2008, going forward, never surrendering.
[56:46.140 --> 56:53.140]  The enemy is massing their giant hordes against us.
[56:53.140 --> 57:01.140]  Remember me, it's throngs, it's hordes are in front of you, they're all around you.
[57:01.140 --> 57:07.140]  While we've still got someone of a free internet that they're only a few years from shutting down,
[57:07.140 --> 57:18.140]  you better use it now to reach out and wake up every person you can like your life depends on it because it does.
[57:18.140 --> 57:24.140]  You better use the info war to swell our numbers to the greatest extent possible.
[57:24.140 --> 57:38.140]  So when the enemy corners us and starts to fight, we can kick their teeth in.
[57:38.140 --> 57:48.140]  You think you're going to run a Soviet 50 million dead op or a free education cultural revolution here?
[57:48.140 --> 57:52.140]  Or some Nazi German bull?
[57:52.140 --> 57:56.140]  You've got another thing coming New World Order.
[57:56.140 --> 58:00.140]  And I'm telling you most important, so they don't do it again after we beat them,
[58:00.140 --> 58:05.140]  is that we don't just arrest a few thousand of them, we don't just try and imprison a few thousand of them.
[58:05.140 --> 58:14.140]  We give them full juries, full trials, and then we hang them high.
[58:14.140 --> 58:19.140]  We hang them high, and we videotape it and we put it on the news.
[58:19.140 --> 58:27.140]  And we make sure people in school watch it, and we make sure it's a message to tyrants everywhere that they lost.
[58:27.140 --> 58:29.140]  And then we can go to the stars.
[58:29.140 --> 58:35.140]  First we have to cut off the cancer.
[58:35.140 --> 58:44.140]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:44.140 --> 58:48.140]  It is a big idea, a New World Order.
[58:48.140 --> 58:53.140]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[58:53.140 --> 58:56.140]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[58:56.140 --> 58:59.140]  Both their objective being world domination.
[58:59.140 --> 59:02.140]  For thousands of years, their Dark Order grew.
[59:02.140 --> 59:12.140]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[59:12.140 --> 59:18.140]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[59:18.140 --> 59:22.140]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[59:22.140 --> 59:25.140]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[59:25.140 --> 59:29.140]  They have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power.

[59:38.140 --> 59:56.140]  In-game blueprint for global enslaved. You have been warned.
[1:00:15.140 --> 1:00:21.140]  It is not my opinion, though just observing it, it's crystal clear what they're doing.
[1:00:21.140 --> 1:00:28.140]  We have all the manuals, all the training, all the think tank documents.
[1:00:28.140 --> 1:00:31.140]  Our enemy has been very haughty.
[1:00:31.140 --> 1:00:38.140]  But we have them admitting it. Barack Obama, and of course the government's been setting up the platform for this, the foundation of this,
[1:00:38.140 --> 1:00:55.140]  wants a million-plus man youth brigades armed in uniforms as a civilian national security force to operate under homeland security.
[1:00:55.140 --> 1:01:02.140]  That is the trifecta. When they hire youth brigades, then when they hire felons, and when they hire foreigners,
[1:01:02.140 --> 1:01:08.140]  and even the associated press admitted, what they really look for is foreigners who are felons.
[1:01:08.140 --> 1:01:15.140]  When the government is doing that, you know it is not just a tyranny, it's a tyranny that means to kill you.
[1:01:15.140 --> 1:01:21.140]  It's a tyranny that means to lock your cities down and watch you starve to death, as New Orleans was a test run.
[1:01:21.140 --> 1:01:32.140]  It is a government of pure evil who admits that it has studied all of the tyrannies of the last 3,000 years and now brings you the scientific dictatorship.
[1:01:32.140 --> 1:01:37.140]  Barack Obama has proposed this. It is staggering in its proportions.
[1:01:37.140 --> 1:01:41.140]  A great article by Paul Watson, Obama calls for national civilian scousing.
[1:01:41.140 --> 1:01:44.140]  Also another great one on infowars.com by Kurt Nemo.
[1:01:44.140 --> 1:01:49.140]  But Paul's goes through some of the background as well and how it ties into other areas.
[1:01:49.140 --> 1:01:54.140]  People will read this and think, oh, that's just Obama. No, this is all part of a larger program.
[1:01:54.140 --> 1:01:57.140]  Anything he says, everything he does is fed to him.
[1:01:57.140 --> 1:02:02.140]  He doesn't say one word he's not told to say. He's on about a one inch leash.
[1:02:02.140 --> 1:02:08.140]  Now, even more important, you know about knock and talk and gun confiscation,
[1:02:08.140 --> 1:02:12.140]  where the police come to your door and intimidate their way in without warrants and confiscate guns.
[1:02:12.140 --> 1:02:18.140]  All over the nation. Then they lie and say, oh, if you tell us you have guns, you can turn them in, we won't charge you.
[1:02:18.140 --> 1:02:21.140]  Then they lie and charge you. That's now in the news.
[1:02:21.140 --> 1:02:25.140]  That's a federal grant taking blood at warrantless checkpoints.
[1:02:25.140 --> 1:02:29.140]  That's a federal grant from Austin to Chicago.
[1:02:29.140 --> 1:02:34.140]  For those that don't know NBC five WMAQ.
[1:02:34.140 --> 1:02:44.140]  We played it earlier and analyzed it said the National Guard with the state police in Chicago is going to help confiscate illegal guns.
[1:02:44.140 --> 1:02:50.140]  This is their force. They are coming. They're just going to expand it more and more cities, more and more towns, more and more.
[1:02:50.140 --> 1:02:56.140]  Hey, we're just officers. I mean, even in Dallas and Tucson, whether where you don't have gun control, they still come to your door.
[1:02:56.140 --> 1:02:59.140]  It's been the Dallas Morning News and say, hi, we'd like to check your guns.
[1:02:59.140 --> 1:03:02.140]  They do it in middle class areas and they always come during the day.
[1:03:02.140 --> 1:03:05.140]  They always target houses. They surveil you first.
[1:03:05.140 --> 1:03:09.140]  This is admitted for their quote, officer's safety because citizens are dangerous.
[1:03:09.140 --> 1:03:15.140]  Your husband is gone here. Mind if I inspect the weapons?
[1:03:15.140 --> 1:03:21.140]  This is it. This is the most extreme government terrorism and wickedness.
[1:03:21.140 --> 1:03:31.140]  And then they have drills going on for a decade plus from Austin, Texas to Lansing, Michigan, Associated Press reported on it in 2002.
[1:03:31.140 --> 1:03:39.140]  Where they take the elementary students out third, fourth and fifth grade and then throw fake blood on them and scream, we are gun owners.
[1:03:39.140 --> 1:03:43.140]  We are homeschoolers. We don't like public school kids. We're going to kill you. That's in the AP.
[1:03:43.140 --> 1:03:46.140]  The children cry, defecate all of themselves screaming.
[1:03:46.140 --> 1:03:50.140]  They then burn cars up in front of them. The children have mental breaks.
[1:03:50.140 --> 1:03:57.140]  Then they pull the mask off and say, it's okay and have police officers in blue run up and say, we're the officers will protect you.
[1:03:57.140 --> 1:04:02.140]  Hardcore Soviet reeducation camp brainwashing, Associated Press.
[1:04:02.140 --> 1:04:08.140]  Going on right now everywhere. I haven't got video of it in road to tyranny before it was in AP.
[1:04:08.140 --> 1:04:14.140]  Going on before 9-11. That footage was shot in 2000 in Belton, Texas.
[1:04:14.140 --> 1:04:22.140]  Had the police walk up and tell us, turn our cameras off with Marines behind them and Army and special forces.
[1:04:22.140 --> 1:04:30.140]  They are terrorists. See, they started out a decade ago in bomb disposal, but now it's covert ops everywhere.
[1:04:30.140 --> 1:04:35.140]  They're all around you. They're filling files out on everyone.
[1:04:35.140 --> 1:04:39.140]  And most of the people they're filling files out are their servants.
[1:04:39.140 --> 1:04:44.140]  You own companies. You own car dealerships. You own a hotel. They are marking down all the resources.
[1:04:44.140 --> 1:04:51.140]  These are murder gangs. You understand they want your property. They're going to get it at gunpoint unless you wake up.
[1:04:51.140 --> 1:04:58.140]  May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message of information. 9-11 was an inside job.
[1:04:58.140 --> 1:05:01.140]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[1:05:01.140 --> 1:05:08.140]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage? It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, that for a lateral commission, the C.F.R.
[1:05:08.140 --> 1:05:10.140]  They said they had a shadow.
[1:05:10.140 --> 1:05:17.140]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[1:05:17.140 --> 1:05:23.140]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[1:05:23.140 --> 1:05:27.140]  An inside job? How dare you?
[1:05:27.140 --> 1:05:33.140]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[1:05:33.140 --> 1:05:36.140]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[1:05:36.140 --> 1:05:42.140]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of life.

[1:05:51.140 --> 1:05:56.140]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[1:05:56.140 --> 1:06:01.140]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.

[1:06:53.140 --> 1:06:57.140]  I have an easier way we can steal people's credit cards without them even knowing they've been robbed.
[1:06:57.140 --> 1:06:59.140]  How so, Clyde?
[1:06:59.140 --> 1:07:03.140]  I have this RFID reader I picked up on the internet. Just by waving it near you,
[1:07:03.140 --> 1:07:07.140]  I can skim your credit card information while your card is still in your purse. Just watch.
[1:07:07.140 --> 1:07:11.140]  Hey, look. That's my info on the screen. You gotta be kidding me.
[1:07:11.140 --> 1:07:16.140]  Nope. With 50 million credit cards with hidden RFID chips, I figure we'll make a fortune.
[1:07:16.140 --> 1:07:18.140]  As long as people don't hear about identity stronghold.
[1:07:18.140 --> 1:07:21.140]  Why? What's identity stronghold?
[1:07:21.140 --> 1:07:26.140]  They make the secure sleeve. When people keep their credit cards in the shielded secure sleeve, I can't read them.
[1:07:26.140 --> 1:07:29.140]  Do a lot of people already know about the secure sleeve?
[1:07:29.140 --> 1:07:33.140]  No way. Most people don't realize they even have chips in their credit cards and passports.
[1:07:33.140 --> 1:07:36.140]  Clyde, we should get some of those secure sleeves.
[1:07:36.140 --> 1:07:39.140]  I already got some. I also got some to fit our passports.
[1:07:39.140 --> 1:07:44.140]  Identity stronghold has secure sleeves for sale right on the internet at idstronghold.com.
[1:07:44.140 --> 1:07:46.140]  idstronghold.com?
[1:07:46.140 --> 1:08:00.140]  Right. Or you can call them at 1-800-610-2770.
[1:08:16.140 --> 1:08:23.140]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live. Thank you for joining us today.
[1:08:23.140 --> 1:08:26.140]  I know what I'm saying is extreme.
[1:08:26.140 --> 1:08:32.140]  Remember, I'm the guy 12, 13 years ago who didn't know about the stuff.
[1:08:32.140 --> 1:08:35.140]  I found out about the private fellow reserve.
[1:08:35.140 --> 1:08:42.140]  I got involved fighting the globalist and then I would laugh at people who talked about black helicopters and martial law takeovers.
[1:08:42.140 --> 1:08:51.140]  And then they started doing drills all over Texas and crashing helicopters in Houston and shooting into all night restaurants, live bullets.
[1:08:51.140 --> 1:08:55.140]  Then I went and interviewed emergency managers who were Vietnam vets.
[1:08:55.140 --> 1:08:59.140]  They were like Thomas Sanchez. He was an intelligence.
[1:08:59.140 --> 1:09:03.140]  So they admitted and gave him a PDD 25 for martial law.
[1:09:03.140 --> 1:09:11.140]  Then I interviewed the police chief of San Antonio and you're in the police chief's office and he says, yeah, they brought bags of money in and tried to bribe me.
[1:09:11.140 --> 1:09:14.140]  They're like they do in Iraq, folks. They compromise you.
[1:09:14.140 --> 1:09:18.140]  That's how they bought off all the warlords. That's how they get control.
[1:09:18.140 --> 1:09:22.140]  They're doing that here. Do you understand?
[1:09:22.140 --> 1:09:30.140]  The Delta Force is just a hit team, military delivered by the CIA, delivered by the military for the CIA.
[1:09:30.140 --> 1:09:37.140]  And now they've got all these other teams and SEALS teams and all these huge clandestine teams they're creating.
[1:09:37.140 --> 1:09:43.140]  And they run around bribing police chiefs and sheriffs and getting intelligence, gathering intelligence who will go along with it.
[1:09:43.140 --> 1:09:50.140]  And the cities open up their arms and they practice takeovers at the city halls and tell them it's for overseas and it is dual use.
[1:09:50.140 --> 1:10:05.140]  But the main part of the training is to train the locals to acquiesce to federal control, international control, and to condition the public to accept it and the military that it's okay and normal.
[1:10:05.140 --> 1:10:09.140]  And they now rotate the entire Marine Corps force through this stuff.
[1:10:09.140 --> 1:10:16.140]  They now rotate large parts of the 500,000 man army through this.
[1:10:16.140 --> 1:10:27.140]  Do you understand, ladies and gentlemen, that you've got a military industrial complex that gets 800 plus billion dollars a year is also involved in trafficking in narcotics hundreds of billions a year.
[1:10:27.140 --> 1:10:35.140]  They're owned by private banks and they're doing what militaries do all over the world from Rome to England to Germany.
[1:10:35.140 --> 1:10:37.140]  They're just saying, why don't we just take over?
[1:10:37.140 --> 1:10:41.140]  And that's what the bankers are doing.
[1:10:41.140 --> 1:10:44.140]  But these are really vicious bankers.
[1:10:44.140 --> 1:10:46.140]  I mean, they didn't just take over Russia.
[1:10:46.140 --> 1:10:50.140]  The poor peasants thought, oh, you're here to get the czar off our back.
[1:10:50.140 --> 1:10:51.140]  Man, we're going to help you.
[1:10:51.140 --> 1:10:54.140]  And then once they got them in, they said, by the way, we're going to kill 50 million of you.
[1:10:54.140 --> 1:10:56.140]  We want all your property.
[1:10:56.140 --> 1:10:58.140]  We don't even want you to live out there as serfs.
[1:10:58.140 --> 1:11:04.140]  We just want you dead because you're Christians and we're communists and we don't believe in that.
[1:11:04.140 --> 1:11:06.140]  These are the same banks.
[1:11:06.140 --> 1:11:09.140]  I mean, again, I've had top historians on to cover it for you.
[1:11:09.140 --> 1:11:12.140]  People who are historians at the White House.
[1:11:12.140 --> 1:11:18.140]  Richard C. Cook yesterday saying, yeah, these are the people that put the Nazis in.
[1:11:18.140 --> 1:11:20.140]  We have Lord Milner's own documents out of England.
[1:11:20.140 --> 1:11:25.140]  Put the Nazis in to tear up Europe.
[1:11:25.140 --> 1:11:28.140]  You understand what we're dealing with here?
[1:11:28.140 --> 1:11:33.140]  You understand they're going to do what they did in Russia here.
[1:11:33.140 --> 1:11:40.140]  It is a horrible feeling to know you're right and to have all the documents and all the evidence and more information than you could ever talk about.
[1:11:40.140 --> 1:11:43.140]  More proof than you could ever stack on top of proof.
[1:11:43.140 --> 1:11:46.140]  To know they brainwashed our military and police.
[1:11:46.140 --> 1:11:49.140]  To know they preconditioned them to not even listen to me right now.
[1:11:49.140 --> 1:11:54.140]  To know.
[1:11:54.140 --> 1:11:59.140]  I remember police 10 years ago laughing at me when I'd say they're getting rid of Posse Commentatus.
[1:11:59.140 --> 1:12:04.140]  The ground police, not the emergency managers and police chiefs, they would nod and say, yeah, we're in a lot of trouble.
[1:12:04.140 --> 1:12:06.140]  I'd see generals and colonels at events.
[1:12:06.140 --> 1:12:09.140]  I'd see them on the street and they'd like, hey, by the way, I listen, you're right on.
[1:12:09.140 --> 1:12:10.140]  Keep it up.
[1:12:10.140 --> 1:12:11.140]  I can't say anything.
[1:12:11.140 --> 1:12:17.140]  Anybody in a command position 10 years ago knew 10, 12 years ago.
[1:12:17.140 --> 1:12:25.140]  Why do you think all these vets and all these intelligence agents got out in the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, and all came out and said,
[1:12:25.140 --> 1:12:27.140]  the new old order is coming to get your guns.
[1:12:27.140 --> 1:12:28.140]  They're going to hire felons.
[1:12:28.140 --> 1:12:29.140]  They're going to hire criminals.
[1:12:29.140 --> 1:12:30.140]  They're going to hire youth brigades.
[1:12:30.140 --> 1:12:32.140]  They tried to recruit me.
[1:12:32.140 --> 1:12:37.140]  Warn everybody in the news said, look at these crazy military vets.
[1:12:37.140 --> 1:12:45.140]  Look at these crazy colonels and captains and majors and look at these crazy intelligence officers like Mark Kornke.
[1:12:45.140 --> 1:12:51.140]  Look at these crazy, look at this crazy Air Force intelligence guy, Red Beckman.
[1:12:51.140 --> 1:12:53.140]  Look at all these crazy intelligence people.
[1:12:53.140 --> 1:12:54.140]  They're just nuts.
[1:12:54.140 --> 1:13:00.140]  Look at this crazy guy who was in Naval Intelligence, William Cooper.
[1:13:00.140 --> 1:13:01.140]  Look at all of them.
[1:13:01.140 --> 1:13:03.140]  They're saying all this is coming.
[1:13:03.140 --> 1:13:08.140]  They're just nuts.
[1:13:08.140 --> 1:13:10.140]  And now what have we seen?
[1:13:10.140 --> 1:13:11.140]  We're now here.
[1:13:11.140 --> 1:13:17.140]  We're now right up to the gallows and they're sticking your head in it, telling you it's a tie.
[1:13:17.140 --> 1:13:20.140]  And there's a guy in a black mask with a hand on a lever.
[1:13:20.140 --> 1:13:25.140]  And let me tell you, that isn't a tie they're putting around our neck.
[1:13:25.140 --> 1:13:29.140]  And the idiots in the audience that are laughing saying, hang him, hang him.
[1:13:29.140 --> 1:13:32.140]  That's the cops and government employees that think this is cute.
[1:13:32.140 --> 1:13:34.140]  They don't understand that they're not an audience.
[1:13:34.140 --> 1:13:39.140]  They're in line to go up to the gallows.
[1:13:39.140 --> 1:13:42.140]  I mean, statistically, nobody is going to be in a worse place than the police.
[1:13:42.140 --> 1:13:45.140]  They're going to use you in the military for a purge.
[1:13:45.140 --> 1:13:47.140]  Then they're going to have a fake counter-revolution.
[1:13:47.140 --> 1:13:50.140]  They're very sophisticated, probably a socialist or communist one.
[1:13:50.140 --> 1:13:54.140]  And then they're going to try all of you and kill most of you.
[1:13:54.140 --> 1:13:56.140]  But it'll be kangaroo trials.
[1:13:56.140 --> 1:13:58.140]  And then the real tyranny will start.
[1:13:58.140 --> 1:14:00.140]  Or they may just go right to it.
[1:14:00.140 --> 1:14:03.140]  More and more, it looks like they're just going to go right into it.
[1:14:03.140 --> 1:14:08.140]  And you'll know, you'll wake up and it'll be, you know, the presidents declared civil emergency.
[1:14:08.140 --> 1:14:14.140]  The terrorists have hit this major city with a low yield nuke.
[1:14:14.140 --> 1:14:16.140]  Tens of thousands are dead.
[1:14:16.140 --> 1:14:18.140]  The stock market has crashed.
[1:14:18.140 --> 1:14:20.140]  The president will come on TV.
[1:14:20.140 --> 1:14:22.140]  Within hours, they will roll a patsy out.
[1:14:22.140 --> 1:14:25.140]  Our special forces, you know, caught this guy.
[1:14:25.140 --> 1:14:27.140]  He's White Al Qaeda.
[1:14:27.140 --> 1:14:32.140]  And the guy will be an actor who thinks he's getting a face job afterwards.
[1:14:32.140 --> 1:14:33.140]  They'll kill him afterwards.
[1:14:33.140 --> 1:14:35.140]  They'll have lots of confessions and videos.
[1:14:35.140 --> 1:14:36.140]  They'll show him to you for years.
[1:14:36.140 --> 1:14:42.140]  I mean, that's the most likely.
[1:14:42.140 --> 1:14:46.140]  So just remember cops when you're living in one room apartments and you can't even get enough food to eat.
[1:14:46.140 --> 1:14:48.140]  And people are taking potshots at you.
[1:14:48.140 --> 1:14:50.140]  Remember, we warned you.
[1:14:50.140 --> 1:14:55.140]  Remember, we tried to save the republic.
[1:14:55.140 --> 1:15:02.140]  But you and your bosses had to legalize all the illegals, had to hire all the felons, had to have gun confiscation.
[1:15:02.140 --> 1:15:06.140]  There were over 800 people killed in 2006.
[1:15:06.140 --> 1:15:08.140]  2007 numbers came out.
[1:15:08.140 --> 1:15:09.140]  It was only about 500.
[1:15:09.140 --> 1:15:12.140]  It actually cut back a bit because they all killed each other.
[1:15:12.140 --> 1:15:20.140]  And then it's up this year, close to the growth trend we saw two years ago, on the Texas border.
[1:15:20.140 --> 1:15:28.140]  Rocket attacks, hand grenade attacks on newspapers, truck bombs in Dallas, murders in Austin, murders in San Antonio.
[1:15:28.140 --> 1:15:33.140]  Police being killed in their homes because they wouldn't go on the take.
[1:15:33.140 --> 1:15:35.140]  Just total bedlam.
[1:15:35.140 --> 1:15:40.140]  Never on the national news, only on the local news, back in the paper.
[1:15:40.140 --> 1:15:42.140]  Thousands and thousands dead over the years.
[1:15:42.140 --> 1:15:48.140]  Total towns shut down on the border, both sides, just a great thriving economy gone.
[1:15:48.140 --> 1:15:57.140]  I've had sheriffs on who've confiscated a truckload of marijuana three miles over the border on a major highway.
[1:15:57.140 --> 1:16:03.140]  And the Mexican troops just drive up in Humvees, supplied by our government.
[1:16:03.140 --> 1:16:06.140]  They jump out with their German, Heckler and Koch submachine guns.
[1:16:06.140 --> 1:16:12.140]  And they take the marijuana back and laugh at our police.
[1:16:12.140 --> 1:16:14.140]  Our border patrol has been ordered not to fire back.
[1:16:14.140 --> 1:16:15.140]  I mean, I've had them all on.
[1:16:15.140 --> 1:16:19.140]  You will never hear that in the news, ladies and gentlemen, national news.
[1:16:19.140 --> 1:16:23.140]  But oh no, almost every day.
[1:16:23.140 --> 1:16:24.140]  You look at the numbers.
[1:16:24.140 --> 1:16:25.140]  It's about three a week.
[1:16:25.140 --> 1:16:27.140]  Children are dying.
[1:16:27.140 --> 1:16:30.140]  And then you look, almost all of them are gang members shooting each other.
[1:16:30.140 --> 1:16:31.140]  And that's not a good thing.
[1:16:31.140 --> 1:16:35.140]  But if you hear that newscast, the children are being killed.
[1:16:35.140 --> 1:16:44.140]  First, we put SWAT teams on the streets running random checkpoints all over the city and confiscating guns and rating old people's houses.
[1:16:44.140 --> 1:16:53.140]  But now, now we have to use the National Guard in the gun confiscation.
[1:16:53.140 --> 1:16:59.140]  Then the guns, it makes it a criminal haven.
[1:16:59.140 --> 1:17:02.140]  I mean, the Chicago police are criminals.
[1:17:02.140 --> 1:17:03.140]  Even they'll tell you that.
[1:17:03.140 --> 1:17:09.140]  I mean, it is a, you might have one out of 10 who just wants to have their beat job and be left alone.
[1:17:09.140 --> 1:17:11.140]  But everybody knows you don't even talk back to them.
[1:17:11.140 --> 1:17:12.140]  It's not like New York cops even scream it.
[1:17:12.140 --> 1:17:14.140]  They'll just come over and beat you on the head and won't say a word.
[1:17:14.140 --> 1:17:15.140]  And they run the drugs.
[1:17:15.140 --> 1:17:16.140]  They run the whores.
[1:17:16.140 --> 1:17:19.140]  They come in to, I mean, you own a mailboxes, et cetera.
[1:17:19.140 --> 1:17:22.140]  They cops walk in and say, write on surveillance cameras.
[1:17:22.140 --> 1:17:23.140]  They don't care.
[1:17:23.140 --> 1:17:24.140]  All right, put the money.
[1:17:24.140 --> 1:17:26.140]  That's a thousand this month.
[1:17:26.140 --> 1:17:27.140]  And you say, I don't have the money.
[1:17:27.140 --> 1:17:28.140]  Let me see your books.
[1:17:28.140 --> 1:17:30.140]  And it's been on tape.
[1:17:30.140 --> 1:17:31.140]  It gets out in lawsuits.
[1:17:31.140 --> 1:17:33.140]  You never see it on the news, but they're out there.
[1:17:33.140 --> 1:17:38.140]  A few of them, when they beat women up or rape them on the table at the restaurant, that's on TV.
[1:17:38.140 --> 1:17:40.140]  But they just look in your books.
[1:17:40.140 --> 1:17:42.140]  Now, let's see how much you're making.
[1:17:42.140 --> 1:17:44.140]  Just, just, they run it.
[1:17:44.140 --> 1:17:47.140]  The mobs always run Chicago.
[1:17:47.140 --> 1:17:51.140]  Mayor Daly runs it like his mom, boss, daddy did.
[1:17:51.140 --> 1:17:59.140]  Those dirtbag crooks could care less that gang bangers are shooting each other over drugs the police sold them.
[1:17:59.140 --> 1:18:03.140]  And they have, of hundreds of people they interview on the street, they find one or two to sit there and say,
[1:18:03.140 --> 1:18:04.140]  I love it.
[1:18:04.140 --> 1:18:05.140]  Take all my rights.
[1:18:05.140 --> 1:18:06.140]  Do whatever you want.
[1:18:06.140 --> 1:18:08.140]  Whatever you want.
[1:18:08.140 --> 1:18:11.140]  Have the National Guard going door to door taking our guns.
[1:18:11.140 --> 1:18:12.140]  You see?
[1:18:12.140 --> 1:18:14.140]  First it's, oh, it's just for al-Qaeda in New York.
[1:18:14.140 --> 1:18:23.140]  Well, in Dallas and Houston and Michigan and, and, you know, Detroit and LA and, and, and don't you videotape them?
[1:18:23.140 --> 1:18:25.140]  And we do videotape them.
[1:18:25.140 --> 1:18:33.140]  They'll run across the street, run up going, you mother bleepa, I'm going to, you know, beat the bleepa out of you.
[1:18:33.140 --> 1:18:34.140]  And they break them up.
[1:18:34.140 --> 1:18:40.140]  It's groups of illegal alien military, black gangmanger and literally groups of retarded appellations.
[1:18:40.140 --> 1:18:42.140]  And that's all you see in New York.
[1:18:42.140 --> 1:18:50.140]  Next to cops, fat cops, making weird faces, puffing up all weird, wearing their helmets.
[1:18:50.140 --> 1:18:55.140]  And you ought to see these guys that were like German shepherds in front of them just sitting there with, with, with MP5 going,
[1:18:55.140 --> 1:19:01.140]  ugh, making, making these stupid frowny faces like a cartoon police state comic book.
[1:19:01.140 --> 1:19:08.140]  I mean, they look worse than the illustrations and illustrated 1984 bucks of guys in, you know, thug uniforms and helmets.
[1:19:08.140 --> 1:19:13.140]  I mean, it's like, it's like, it's like, oh, you know, these big, huge, fake frowns.
[1:19:13.140 --> 1:19:27.140]  Oh, I'm so tough and just standing there, getting you all used to the tool how it is now to live in America.
[1:19:27.140 --> 1:19:28.140]  Oh, God help us.
[1:19:28.140 --> 1:19:29.140]  I want to take your calls.
[1:19:29.140 --> 1:19:34.140]  I want to hear from veterans and police who say they're with the Constitution and the Republic and the Founding Fathers
[1:19:34.140 --> 1:19:38.140]  and who know what this is and aren't going to go along with it. I want to hear from citizens.

[1:21:19.140 --> 1:21:21.140]  Proponents of the new world order.
[1:21:21.140 --> 1:21:24.140]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[1:21:24.140 --> 1:21:27.140]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[1:21:27.140 --> 1:21:31.140]  Everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated,
[1:21:31.140 --> 1:21:34.140]  the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses,
[1:21:34.140 --> 1:21:36.140]  the destruction of the earth and mankind.
[1:21:36.140 --> 1:21:40.140]  We will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.

[1:22:50.140 --> 1:22:52.140]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[1:22:52.140 --> 1:22:54.140]  July 17, 2008.
[1:22:54.140 --> 1:22:56.140]  Goal opened at $9.5910.
[1:22:56.140 --> 1:22:59.140]  One ounce gold coins can be purchased for $9.8644.
[1:22:59.140 --> 1:23:03.140]  $485.75 for half ounce and $242.88 for quarter ounce.
[1:23:03.140 --> 1:23:07.140]  That's $9.8644, $485.75 and $242.88.
[1:23:07.140 --> 1:23:10.140]  Hedgehog is caught in the malaise of mortgage bankruptcies.
[1:23:10.140 --> 1:23:12.140]  The bond market continues to slump.
[1:23:12.140 --> 1:23:15.140]  Morgan gets caught in a $10 billion bad deal for Chrysler.
[1:23:15.140 --> 1:23:17.140]  Housing sales fell 6.6%.
[1:23:17.140 --> 1:23:22.140]  Mortgage giant countrywide showed mortgage payment was spreading to the middle and upper class.
[1:23:22.140 --> 1:23:26.140]  Investors cast out on investment banks credit protection insurance for mortgage lenders
[1:23:26.140 --> 1:23:29.140]  and skyrocketing due to the increased risk.
[1:23:29.140 --> 1:23:33.140]  The US dollar is free falling against foreign currencies in countries that previously financed the US
[1:23:33.140 --> 1:23:35.140]  are now seeking safer alternatives.
[1:23:35.140 --> 1:23:38.140]  Economist Rody Boy published the report Bubble Leaking.
[1:23:38.140 --> 1:23:41.140]  Call for the report today, 866-2237.
[1:23:41.140 --> 1:23:44.140]  The value of your hard earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.
[1:23:44.140 --> 1:23:47.140]  Call 800-686-2237.
[1:23:47.140 --> 1:24:16.140]  That's 800-686-2237.
[1:24:29.140 --> 1:24:39.140]  Coming straight on from the tyrants.
[1:24:39.140 --> 1:24:46.140]  You are the progeny.
[1:24:46.140 --> 1:24:49.140]  You are the offspring of the men and men.
[1:24:49.140 --> 1:24:54.140]  Of the sons of liberty.
[1:24:54.140 --> 1:24:56.140]  Arise.
[1:24:56.140 --> 1:24:58.140]  Make a stand.
[1:24:58.140 --> 1:25:02.140]  Defend the republic.
[1:25:02.140 --> 1:25:09.140]  The suicides are depending on which government report you see 14 to 18 times.
[1:25:09.140 --> 1:25:12.140]  Any previous record of the military.
[1:25:12.140 --> 1:25:14.140]  They've seen the evil.
[1:25:14.140 --> 1:25:16.140]  They've seen the heart of something bad.
[1:25:16.140 --> 1:25:21.140]  They're coming home and killing themselves.
[1:25:21.140 --> 1:25:26.140]  They could be like Saul of Tarsus who persecuted and killed innocents.
[1:25:26.140 --> 1:25:31.140]  They can't ask God to take them over and to be vessels against evil.
[1:25:31.140 --> 1:25:33.140]  And then they will have no more guilt.
[1:25:33.140 --> 1:25:36.140]  They will no longer feel bad and feel ashamed.
[1:25:36.140 --> 1:25:38.140]  You join the side of good.
[1:25:38.140 --> 1:25:43.140]  You commit and commit to get past your fear and commit your body.
[1:25:43.140 --> 1:25:45.140]  And your mind.
[1:25:45.140 --> 1:25:47.140]  And you're sold this fight.
[1:25:47.140 --> 1:25:53.140]  Your problem is going to be that you're going to have too much energy and you're going to feel too good about what you're doing and too motivated.
[1:25:53.140 --> 1:25:56.140]  It's amazing. I used to care that my hair was falling out.
[1:25:56.140 --> 1:25:58.140]  I could care less what I look like now.
[1:25:58.140 --> 1:26:00.140]  I could care less how I dress.
[1:26:00.140 --> 1:26:03.140]  Though I try to dress okay so that it's more presentable what I have to say.
[1:26:03.140 --> 1:26:06.140]  I got to remember to comb my hair when I'm on TV because I don't care.
[1:26:06.140 --> 1:26:08.140]  I don't care about wrinkles.
[1:26:08.140 --> 1:26:11.140]  I don't care about a hernia I got.
[1:26:11.140 --> 1:26:13.140]  I don't care about black circles around my eyes.
[1:26:13.140 --> 1:26:15.140]  I don't care what people think about me.
[1:26:15.140 --> 1:26:17.140]  Because I'm thinking about stuff that matters.
[1:26:17.140 --> 1:26:19.140]  I'm thinking about how they're putting cancer viruses in everybody's shots.
[1:26:19.140 --> 1:26:21.140]  Yeah, that freaks me out.
[1:26:21.140 --> 1:26:23.140]  I'm thinking about how they're poisoning all of us.
[1:26:23.140 --> 1:26:25.140]  I'm thinking about how crazy all of this is.
[1:26:25.140 --> 1:26:29.140]  How they're making all these hundreds of cross species human hybrids right now.
[1:26:29.140 --> 1:26:39.140]  I'm thinking about how the GMO foods, every one of them admittedly that's been cross species DNA changed is killing us.
[1:26:39.140 --> 1:26:43.140]  I think about how it's one thing to read 10, 12 years ago.
[1:26:43.140 --> 1:26:47.140]  Then to find the plans from the 60s for all of this.
[1:26:47.140 --> 1:26:51.140]  To have youth brigades and gun confiscation teams and how they would phase in martial law.
[1:26:51.140 --> 1:26:55.140]  But it's one thing to report they were planning it.
[1:26:55.140 --> 1:26:59.140]  It is another thing to see them putting it into place.
[1:26:59.140 --> 1:27:07.140]  And so, you know sometimes I get a little selfish and go man I want to go fishing.
[1:27:07.140 --> 1:27:09.140]  I want to go see monuments.
[1:27:09.140 --> 1:27:11.140]  I want to go to the theater.
[1:27:11.140 --> 1:27:13.140]  I want to go see a symphony.
[1:27:13.140 --> 1:27:17.140]  I want to spend time with my grandmother who's a great grandmother to my children.
[1:27:17.140 --> 1:27:19.140]  And then I just think about it.
[1:27:19.140 --> 1:27:23.140]  None of it even matters compared to fighting this great evil.
[1:27:23.140 --> 1:27:27.140]  And then I'm not even worried about them killing me or setting me up.
[1:27:27.140 --> 1:27:29.140]  I know torture in long decades in prison are bad.
[1:27:29.140 --> 1:27:35.140]  But in a way even though I know they'll probably get me one day and torture me.
[1:27:35.140 --> 1:27:37.140]  That's what they enjoy and that's what they like.
[1:27:37.140 --> 1:27:45.140]  It doesn't matter because I go on the same line of so many others that stood up for humanity and goodness and what God wants.
[1:27:45.140 --> 1:27:47.140]  And I know there's a God.
[1:27:47.140 --> 1:27:49.140]  And I know there's good and evil.
[1:27:49.140 --> 1:27:51.140]  I know there's two forces.
[1:27:51.140 --> 1:27:53.140]  And I know one is greater than the other.
[1:27:53.140 --> 1:27:55.140]  One creates life.
[1:27:55.140 --> 1:28:03.140]  One generates creativity and beauty and everything good and everything that I bow before.
[1:28:03.140 --> 1:28:14.140]  And then I realize that most people don't understand that we all die.
[1:28:14.140 --> 1:28:19.140]  And I know you consciously know that but do you really know what that means?
[1:28:19.140 --> 1:28:21.140]  You realize how transitory it is.
[1:28:21.140 --> 1:28:29.140]  And I mean those are just words but the thought of that and the thought of all those that have come before us and all those that will come after us.
[1:28:29.140 --> 1:28:34.140]  And then there's the understanding that we are all individuals.
[1:28:34.140 --> 1:28:38.140]  The enemy also understands we're communal so they try to create a counterfeit of that.
[1:28:38.140 --> 1:28:42.140]  I don't mean the enemy's communal system but I mean I realize that I don't die.
[1:28:42.140 --> 1:28:44.140]  Even if you don't believe in life after death I mean I don't die.
[1:28:44.140 --> 1:28:52.140]  I go on through my children but through other people living and through their pleasures and their pains and their adversity and their trailblazing and exploration and everything.
[1:28:52.140 --> 1:28:54.140]  I'm living through them.
[1:28:54.140 --> 1:28:55.140]  The forefathers.
[1:28:55.140 --> 1:28:56.140]  They're living through me.
[1:28:56.140 --> 1:28:59.140]  Everybody that fought. Everybody that was strong.
[1:28:59.140 --> 1:29:01.140]  All of their adversity.
[1:29:01.140 --> 1:29:02.140]  Everything they went through.
[1:29:02.140 --> 1:29:04.140]  We are part of them.
[1:29:04.140 --> 1:29:06.140]  We are part of that stream of humanity.
[1:29:06.140 --> 1:29:08.140]  You see you think you live forever.
[1:29:08.140 --> 1:29:10.140]  You have this idea you live forever.
[1:29:10.140 --> 1:29:12.140]  You feel this depth of history.
[1:29:12.140 --> 1:29:16.140]  You have these things you see as instincts.
[1:29:16.140 --> 1:29:23.140]  And really that is just dipping into the consciousness that has been our species for millennia upon millennia.
[1:29:23.140 --> 1:29:26.140]  Back into the dark mist of our development.
[1:29:26.140 --> 1:29:28.140]  And then there's no more fear.
[1:29:28.140 --> 1:29:37.140]  There's only concern that we will not show ourselves strong for our species and forge ahead and do what's good for humanity.
[1:29:37.140 --> 1:29:41.140]  We'll be right back with your calls I promise. Stay with us.
[1:29:41.140 --> 1:29:43.140]  We're on the march.
[1:29:43.140 --> 1:29:45.140]  The Empire's on the run.
[1:29:45.140 --> 1:29:51.140]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:29:51.140 --> 1:29:54.140]  Keep out of reach of children under six years of age.
[1:29:54.140 --> 1:29:56.140]  If you accidentally swallow more than used for brushing.
[1:29:56.140 --> 1:30:00.140]  Seek professional assistance or contact a poison control center immediately.
[1:30:00.140 --> 1:30:03.140]  Why would you or your family use a product with this warning?
[1:30:03.140 --> 1:30:07.140]  If you're looking for a safe and natural alternative to keep your teeth healthy, clean and sparkling.

[1:30:47.140 --> 1:30:51.140]  I mentioned GCN for a free gift, complete with a 90 day money back guarantee.
[1:30:51.140 --> 1:30:59.140]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Sierra and we knew what to do.
[1:30:59.140 --> 1:31:01.140]  Or at least we thought we did.
[1:31:01.140 --> 1:31:08.140]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[1:31:08.140 --> 1:31:16.140]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[1:31:16.140 --> 1:31:23.140]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[1:31:23.140 --> 1:31:26.140]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[1:31:26.140 --> 1:31:32.140]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[1:31:32.140 --> 1:31:35.140]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[1:31:35.140 --> 1:31:41.140]  Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.

[1:31:44.140 --> 1:31:51.140]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[1:31:51.140 --> 1:31:57.140]  When I learned that the accumulation of acidic waste was the likely cause of my painful joints, lack of energy, and weight gain,
[1:31:57.140 --> 1:32:02.140]  I knew I would have to change to a more alkaline diet, but it just seems so difficult.
[1:32:02.140 --> 1:32:12.140]  Then a friend suggested I try a Jupiter water ionizer from SnyderHealth.com and detox my body even before I changed my diet by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[1:32:12.140 --> 1:32:15.140]  Drinking water? No, that's something I can handle.
[1:32:15.140 --> 1:32:21.140]  The guys at SnyderHealth took the time to explain all of the different options and helped me choose the ionizer that was right for me.
[1:32:21.140 --> 1:32:27.140]  I used my new Jupiter ionizer for everything, for drinking, for cooking, and since I've been drinking the water, I have more energy,
[1:32:27.140 --> 1:32:33.140]  my joint pains are gone, and I already lost 7 pounds, and my skin looks great.
[1:32:33.140 --> 1:32:40.140]  Give them a call today at 877-356-2508 to find out which ionizer is right for you.

[1:32:51.140 --> 1:33:07.140]  Music
[1:33:07.140 --> 1:33:18.140]  I mean, do we really want to be overrun by a murder team for the bankers?
[1:33:18.140 --> 1:33:26.140]  I mean, do we really? I mean, you really want to have people in black uniforms on every corner and your kids spying on you?
[1:33:26.140 --> 1:33:33.140]  Do you want the troops going door-to-door? That's where we live now.
[1:33:33.140 --> 1:33:41.140]  We've only got our foot in the water, but real fast, we're going all the way under.
[1:33:41.140 --> 1:33:51.140]  Those of you that haven't studied history, you better look at it real fast, because it isn't a game.
[1:33:51.140 --> 1:34:02.140]  This is for keeps. There's no doubt we've got people running our government who are into evil.
[1:34:02.140 --> 1:34:09.140]  They are reckless. They want to hurt you. They don't like you.
[1:34:09.140 --> 1:34:12.140]  Let's play the rest of this song, and I'm going right to your call. Stay with us.
[1:34:12.140 --> 1:34:41.140]  Music
[1:34:41.140 --> 1:34:49.140]  Music
[1:34:49.140 --> 1:34:59.140]  Music
[1:34:59.140 --> 1:35:09.140]  Music
[1:35:09.140 --> 1:35:19.140]  Music
[1:35:19.140 --> 1:35:29.140]  Music
[1:35:29.140 --> 1:35:38.140]  Music
[1:35:38.140 --> 1:35:52.140]  Music
[1:35:52.140 --> 1:36:03.140]  I know I'm still alive. Your prayers and a lot of good people on the inside, but nightfall is now upon us.
[1:36:03.140 --> 1:36:08.140]  There's no more time to sit idly by. You have to make your decision.
[1:36:08.140 --> 1:36:12.140]  Music
[1:36:12.140 --> 1:36:20.140]  Of course, tell how much you fell, and left his living in a cheap hotel.
[1:36:20.140 --> 1:36:28.140]  The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold, so the story ends, we're told.
[1:36:28.140 --> 1:36:35.140]  I don't need your prayers, it's true, and say a few for left it to.
[1:36:35.140 --> 1:36:46.140]  He only did what he had to do, and now he's growing old.
[1:36:46.140 --> 1:36:50.140]  Music
[1:36:50.140 --> 1:37:00.140]  Think about it. We are here at the end of the Republic. The true end. The bankers have been in great control for a while, but they want full ownership.
[1:37:00.140 --> 1:37:12.140]  They want full dominance. I got to use the term. They want to piss on your back.
[1:37:12.140 --> 1:37:19.140]  On your knees and enough for them.
[1:37:19.140 --> 1:37:26.140]  And I really feel sorry for the security forces.
[1:37:26.140 --> 1:37:39.140]  Not only are you going to be defeated, but you're going to be known as history, as the evil ones, and you're going to be known as despicable individuals.
[1:37:39.140 --> 1:37:44.140]  And it's just so sad that you will discredit your family line like that.
[1:37:44.140 --> 1:37:50.140]  Never thought about what your family line means, not discrediting your family name, means that good families, you got bad families.
[1:37:50.140 --> 1:37:58.140]  And I bet a lot of you that serve evil, I bet if you look back in your family tree, you've always served evil, haven't you?
[1:37:58.140 --> 1:38:04.140]  Some of you are even worse, some of you had good families, and now you've decided to serve evil.
[1:38:04.140 --> 1:38:08.140]  And it's you that's lost everything, because who you are and what you stand for is who you are.
[1:38:08.140 --> 1:38:12.140]  It isn't how you look or what you've got, or how many bobbles you've got.
[1:38:12.140 --> 1:38:15.140]  Alright, I'm going to shut up. Let's go to Robert in California.
[1:38:15.140 --> 1:38:16.140]  I'm going to move quick.
[1:38:16.140 --> 1:38:18.140]  Robert, then Scott, Steve, Charles, and others.
[1:38:18.140 --> 1:38:20.140]  Go ahead, Robert.
[1:38:20.140 --> 1:38:24.140]  This whole Youth Brigade thing, it's a complete circus show.
[1:38:24.140 --> 1:38:28.140]  Rockefeller wants to promote training kids to be basically chess piece murderers.
[1:38:28.140 --> 1:38:32.140]  These people basically see children as expendable resources.
[1:38:32.140 --> 1:38:38.140]  It's just amazing that so many people find it hard to believe that these men and women in our government are selling us down the river,
[1:38:38.140 --> 1:38:46.140]  even though there's Florida in the water, our food stock, the public has public admiration for population trouble.
[1:38:46.140 --> 1:38:52.140]  Patriot Act wants to justify child torture, and somehow all these goons in control of moderating these things,
[1:38:52.140 --> 1:38:56.140]  moderating things can be evil for looking at a way.
[1:38:56.140 --> 1:39:02.140]  It's kind of like a don't have to tell a policy to it with just this military type philosophy.
[1:39:02.140 --> 1:39:04.140]  It is pure evil.
[1:39:04.140 --> 1:39:08.140]  It is the worst strain of tyranny we've ever seen.
[1:39:08.140 --> 1:39:12.140]  And if it fully manifests, it will be the greatest evil ever carried out.
[1:39:12.140 --> 1:39:14.140]  I mean, it is huge.
[1:39:14.140 --> 1:39:15.140]  Robert, you're right.
[1:39:15.140 --> 1:39:18.140]  I mean, youth brigades, armed spy youth brigades.
[1:39:18.140 --> 1:39:22.140]  I mean, they're not even saying we're setting up youth brigades and they're going to help you in your community.
[1:39:22.140 --> 1:39:26.140]  They're saying they're going to spy on you and they're going to be armed.
[1:39:26.140 --> 1:39:30.140]  They've been setting it up for years, but now it being openly proposed.
[1:39:30.140 --> 1:39:36.140]  And we've got all these other programs going on and hiring felons in the military and police.
[1:39:36.140 --> 1:39:40.140]  I mean, and now the National Guard's going to do gun confiscation in Chicago.
[1:39:40.140 --> 1:39:44.140]  I mean, this is just, it's, it's, it is classic.
[1:39:44.140 --> 1:39:47.140]  It is, it's a thoroughbred of tyranny.
[1:39:47.140 --> 1:39:52.140]  I mean, if they had a dog show and this would be the winner of it.
[1:39:52.140 --> 1:39:53.140]  Well, they have a police state show.
[1:39:53.140 --> 1:39:54.140]  This will be the winner of it.
[1:39:54.140 --> 1:39:57.140]  I mean, this is, this is, this is Uber tyranny.
[1:39:57.140 --> 1:40:01.140]  This is super tyranny. This is, this is tyranny on steroids.
[1:40:01.140 --> 1:40:04.140]  This is, this is 1984.
[1:40:04.140 --> 1:40:07.140]  Just squared.
[1:40:07.140 --> 1:40:09.140]  Anything else?
[1:40:09.140 --> 1:40:15.140]  Um, I, well, I mean, if you, the way I see it, I mean, if you want evidence of the demonization of our government,
[1:40:15.140 --> 1:40:17.140]  just look no further than individuals.
[1:40:17.140 --> 1:40:20.140]  I mean, a regular man is capable of, you know, sin, murder, corruption, and greed.
[1:40:20.140 --> 1:40:24.140]  But when you're in office, it's like you become this exceptional evil.
[1:40:24.140 --> 1:40:27.140]  It's like ignorance is kind of bliss in this country.
[1:40:27.140 --> 1:40:30.140]  I mean, you show people facts and reviews on these issues.
[1:40:30.140 --> 1:40:33.140]  And, you know, because the majority of people don't have PhDs and such.
[1:40:33.140 --> 1:40:34.140]  We're not credible.
[1:40:34.140 --> 1:40:43.140]  And a perfect example of this is, I remember Howard Stern agreed with all the, he disagreed and disregarded with a lot of the info on your show about 9-11 a while back.
[1:40:43.140 --> 1:40:51.140]  And then what's funny is just even there goes on the Howard Stern show and all of a sudden, you know, now the controversy is credible just because it's sourced.
[1:40:51.140 --> 1:40:53.140]  It's still the same facts, just a different source.
[1:40:53.140 --> 1:40:55.140]  I mean, why the wavering opinions?
[1:40:55.140 --> 1:41:00.140]  You know, there's people today based their opinion on what's right and wrong with someone else.
[1:41:00.140 --> 1:41:06.140]  Well, people think if they have an opinion, they say, I've even heard people say, I decide not to believe that.
[1:41:06.140 --> 1:41:08.140]  That's not true.
[1:41:08.140 --> 1:41:11.140]  Like if they say the moon's made of cheese, it makes it made of cheese.
[1:41:11.140 --> 1:41:12.140]  Thank you for the call.
[1:41:12.140 --> 1:41:15.140]  I appreciate the fine points that you made.
[1:41:15.140 --> 1:41:16.140]  And you're right.
[1:41:16.140 --> 1:41:21.140]  Government is so compartmentalized that it allows great evil to grow like nowhere else.
[1:41:21.140 --> 1:41:26.140]  I mean, it's like a tepid cesspit or a pond, you know, that doesn't have moving water through it.
[1:41:26.140 --> 1:41:29.140]  You're going to get leeches and all sorts of bacteria in there.
[1:41:29.140 --> 1:41:31.140]  But then moving water is clean.
[1:41:31.140 --> 1:41:36.140]  A republic with a transparent government is a clean flowing stream, lots of good life in it.
[1:41:36.140 --> 1:41:40.140]  But you've got a cess tank where you're dumping the sewage.
[1:41:40.140 --> 1:41:44.140]  It's going to turn into a leech-filled green bubbling pit.
[1:41:44.140 --> 1:41:50.140]  And this isn't even a leech-filled pit full of feces.
[1:41:50.140 --> 1:41:55.140]  This is a pit of sulfuric acid.
[1:41:55.140 --> 1:42:08.140]  And they're telling us that it's, you know, some wonderful thing and that we need to enjoy all of this and that it's going to be fabulous and it's going to be wonderful.
[1:42:08.140 --> 1:42:11.140]  And all these fools out there don't know they are the targets.
[1:42:11.140 --> 1:42:12.140]  Let's move fast.
[1:42:12.140 --> 1:42:15.140]  Scott in Arizona, Scott, you're on the air.
[1:42:15.140 --> 1:42:24.140]  Yeah, so my question is, I heard a couple weeks back or maybe a week back, one of your shows, you were saying that you're getting really close in less than a 911 thing open
[1:42:24.140 --> 1:42:33.140]  and said that you had some names of some scientists that actually worked on it through NASA, that, you know, some people that you knew were working on it and back engineering it.
[1:42:33.140 --> 1:42:39.140]  Are those names getting closer to finding out who was responsible for it?
[1:42:39.140 --> 1:42:41.140]  Well, I mean, here's an example.
[1:42:41.140 --> 1:42:54.140]  I went and got an interview with Paul Grootie, who was the undertaker when the Secret Service came in and planted the fingerprints of Lee Harvey Oswald on the gun.
[1:42:54.140 --> 1:42:57.140]  Now, a lot of people were killed for that 20 years ago.
[1:42:57.140 --> 1:43:02.140]  People who got the autopsy report, the people that, you know, were thrown out of buildings, murdered.
[1:43:02.140 --> 1:43:05.140]  Now the enemy's moving so fast they don't even care.
[1:43:05.140 --> 1:43:07.140]  Okay, so we put that out.
[1:43:07.140 --> 1:43:15.140]  You know, we put out the E Howard Hunt stuff, you know, the commander who we always knew, but, you know, admitting on his deathbed how they killed Kennedy.
[1:43:15.140 --> 1:43:19.140]  They've admitted the government carried out Gulf of Tonka and staged that.
[1:43:19.140 --> 1:43:21.140]  I mean, they're just admitting it all and you're saying, what are you talking about?
[1:43:21.140 --> 1:43:23.140]  I asked about 911.
[1:43:23.140 --> 1:43:25.140]  It's the same thing.
[1:43:25.140 --> 1:43:36.140]  We have Stephen Jones and, of course, some of the other physicists and scientists and engineers, Kevin Ryan,
[1:43:36.140 --> 1:43:42.140]  they have tracked back who were the only people that had PhDs in knowledge and explosive thermate.
[1:43:42.140 --> 1:43:44.140]  Turns out they own companies in the Defense Department.
[1:43:44.140 --> 1:43:46.140]  Turns out the same people ran security.
[1:43:46.140 --> 1:43:49.140]  Turns out the same people are involved covering up with the NIST report.
[1:43:49.140 --> 1:43:54.140]  So, yes, with the samples, and now they've gotten samples of the stuff they make, it's identical.
[1:43:54.140 --> 1:43:57.140]  We have multiple samples from all three of the towers.
[1:43:57.140 --> 1:44:06.140]  So, yes, they thinly veil whenever they're on the show, I mean, they say their names, but say, interesting person to look at.
[1:44:06.140 --> 1:44:14.140]  But it's, I mean, for any, if there's any real police detectives out there, go read the papers by Kevin Ryan and others on this.
[1:44:14.140 --> 1:44:16.140]  I mean, it's all right there.
[1:44:16.140 --> 1:44:18.140]  And so, yes, we are honing in.
[1:44:18.140 --> 1:44:21.140]  I mean, we know the military national complex, the big players that gave the order.
[1:44:21.140 --> 1:44:26.140]  We know Bush himself and Cheney are just the executors of it.
[1:44:26.140 --> 1:44:30.140]  We've got major intelligence agencies involved of the West.
[1:44:30.140 --> 1:44:41.140]  But, I mean, we're even honing in on the companies and the individuals who, in any court of law, with the evidence, we could send them to prison.
[1:44:41.140 --> 1:44:43.140]  But you're not going to find a court to indict them.
[1:44:43.140 --> 1:44:47.140]  You're not going to find a grand jury to do that.
[1:44:47.140 --> 1:44:49.140]  Yeah, I was just wondering what the next step was.
[1:44:49.140 --> 1:44:53.140]  So, you kind of, I would just, you know, once you get the names, are you, you know, confining them?
[1:44:53.140 --> 1:44:55.140]  I mean, what could we do?
[1:44:55.140 --> 1:45:04.140]  I mean, we go down to, in front of, we go down in front of Larry Silverstein's office when there's five of us or three of us.
[1:45:04.140 --> 1:45:08.140]  And they, Luke Radowski, and they come over and say, we're going to plant bombs on you.
[1:45:08.140 --> 1:45:09.140]  We know you're not terrorists.
[1:45:09.140 --> 1:45:10.140]  We're going to say you are.
[1:45:10.140 --> 1:45:13.140]  And then we came back with a thousand people the next year.
[1:45:13.140 --> 1:45:14.140]  And then they were sitting there cowering.
[1:45:14.140 --> 1:45:17.140]  And then we try to confront all these people and get death threats.
[1:45:17.140 --> 1:45:19.140]  And our families get death threats.
[1:45:19.140 --> 1:45:20.140]  They threaten our children.
[1:45:20.140 --> 1:45:23.140]  And yes, we will continue to do that.
[1:45:23.140 --> 1:45:26.140]  A lot of people, you know, critique me and say, why don't you just do that?
[1:45:26.140 --> 1:45:27.140]  I do do all that.
[1:45:27.140 --> 1:45:29.140]  And the people I support do that.
[1:45:29.140 --> 1:45:30.140]  We're trying the best we can.
[1:45:30.140 --> 1:45:31.140]  Let's take another call.
[1:45:31.140 --> 1:45:35.140]  We're going to cover some financial news in the next segment, folks.
[1:45:35.140 --> 1:45:36.140]  And then Tex Mars is coming in studio.
[1:45:36.140 --> 1:45:37.140]  That's going to be great.
[1:45:37.140 --> 1:45:40.140]  I got to move quicker because I want to get to Charles, especially.
[1:45:40.140 --> 1:45:41.140]  Let's go to Stephen Illinois, though.
[1:45:41.140 --> 1:45:45.140]  He's next where they're really beta testing, but they're doing it everywhere, too.
[1:45:45.140 --> 1:45:46.140]  Door-to-door gun confiscation.
[1:45:46.140 --> 1:45:48.140]  They want to use the National Guard now.
[1:45:48.140 --> 1:45:54.140]  Not enough to have black ski mask, quote, high-profile paramilitary police doing it.
[1:45:54.140 --> 1:45:57.140]  What do you think about what's happening in Illinois, Steve?
[1:45:57.140 --> 1:45:58.140]  Don't like it.
[1:45:58.140 --> 1:46:03.140]  I hate to be your most important call of all time, but I am.
[1:46:03.140 --> 1:46:06.140]  I can tell you many things in pretty short order.
[1:46:06.140 --> 1:46:07.140]  Go ahead.
[1:46:07.140 --> 1:46:09.140]  I am a Jew for Jesus, your way.
[1:46:09.140 --> 1:46:10.140]  I shall die such.
[1:46:10.140 --> 1:46:11.140]  I'm sorry.
[1:46:11.140 --> 1:46:13.140]  I have one life to give.
[1:46:13.140 --> 1:46:18.140]  Give me liberty or give me death in one way because my life is God.
[1:46:18.140 --> 1:46:23.140]  I have good news for you personally and collectively, America.
[1:46:23.140 --> 1:46:26.140]  You know, they've already got our guns.
[1:46:26.140 --> 1:46:29.140]  We've given Israel the country business I love.
[1:46:29.140 --> 1:46:32.140]  The people running it, just like in this country, I load.
[1:46:32.140 --> 1:46:34.140]  Not supposed to, but I do.
[1:46:34.140 --> 1:46:38.140]  Giving them our main ammunition contract.
[1:46:38.140 --> 1:46:39.140]  But no bullets.
[1:46:39.140 --> 1:46:40.140]  What could his guns?
[1:46:40.140 --> 1:46:48.140]  And it starts, gun grab started in 96, I mean, with real zest with Clinton.
[1:46:48.140 --> 1:46:54.140]  And when they made retroactively anybody that was connected to a domestic violence order,
[1:46:54.140 --> 1:46:57.140]  whether you used a threat of a gun.
[1:46:57.140 --> 1:47:01.140]  And then Clinton, remember, said we're going to be doing housing sweeps and gun confiscation.
[1:47:01.140 --> 1:47:03.140]  He said that on MTV.
[1:47:03.140 --> 1:47:07.140]  And then now they've just been rolling out massive gun grabbing, but the news doesn't
[1:47:07.140 --> 1:47:08.140]  report on it.
[1:47:08.140 --> 1:47:10.140]  So the gun grab stuff.
[1:47:10.140 --> 1:47:11.140]  Yeah.
[1:47:11.140 --> 1:47:16.140]  And you know, my antenna went up when I was a candidate for a Vietnam.
[1:47:16.140 --> 1:47:22.140]  I was able to sweep past that, but that's where a juvenile, I got interested.
[1:47:22.140 --> 1:47:29.140]  But 1980 after they sacked Jimmy Carter, a good person of note behind the scenes.
[1:47:29.140 --> 1:47:31.140]  They report a rug out underneath him.
[1:47:31.140 --> 1:47:32.140]  I mean, look like a buffoon.
[1:47:32.140 --> 1:47:35.140]  He was for this country through and through.
[1:47:35.140 --> 1:47:38.140]  Sure as Ronald Reagan and they got married up with Hollywood.
[1:47:38.140 --> 1:47:41.140]  And that's when all this started.
[1:47:41.140 --> 1:47:46.140]  And I don't know if people can't seem to remember a lot of things that goes on that.
[1:47:46.140 --> 1:47:48.140]  But I have good news.
[1:47:48.140 --> 1:47:52.140]  I'm going to shorten it because you want to get to somebody, Alex.
[1:47:52.140 --> 1:47:55.140]  But the good news is, and I have seen, I don't care.
[1:47:55.140 --> 1:48:00.140]  I wouldn't believe it had I not seen a new full with my own baby blues.
[1:48:00.140 --> 1:48:02.140]  I appreciate your call.
[1:48:02.140 --> 1:48:05.140]  There are all sorts of government operations going on.
[1:48:05.140 --> 1:48:07.140]  Let's go to Charles and Louisiana.
[1:48:07.140 --> 1:48:11.140]  Charles has gotten out of close to 10,000 of my DVDs and films of the last decade.
[1:48:11.140 --> 1:48:13.140]  Been listening, I guess, for 10 years.
[1:48:13.140 --> 1:48:16.140]  And Charles was one of the emergency workers.
[1:48:16.140 --> 1:48:21.140]  He witnessed the gun confiscation, the sexual assaults on the women in New Orleans.
[1:48:21.140 --> 1:48:27.140]  And I want to get his take on million plus man youth brigades armed confiscating our guns.
[1:48:27.140 --> 1:48:33.140]  Barack Obama, National Guard to be used to confiscate our guns announced on NBC television.
[1:48:33.140 --> 1:48:35.140]  This is them just rolling it out to us.
[1:48:35.140 --> 1:48:38.140]  Go ahead, Charles.
[1:48:38.140 --> 1:48:40.140]  First, let me say God bless you, my friend.
[1:48:40.140 --> 1:48:42.140]  You are truly American.
[1:48:42.140 --> 1:48:43.140]  And I'm proud.
[1:48:43.140 --> 1:48:44.140]  I'm proud to know you.
[1:48:44.140 --> 1:48:45.140]  I'm proud to know you, Charles.
[1:48:45.140 --> 1:48:47.140]  What's on your mind?
[1:48:47.140 --> 1:48:49.140]  Well, I'll tell you something.
[1:48:49.140 --> 1:48:54.140]  Mr. Jones, the American people, like you say, the old gray man once used to be.
[1:48:54.140 --> 1:48:57.140]  The American people take all your knowledge.
[1:48:57.140 --> 1:49:00.140]  But how many of them put it to use?
[1:49:00.140 --> 1:49:03.140]  How many of them go tell them about this program?
[1:49:03.140 --> 1:49:05.140]  How many of them get your tapes?
[1:49:05.140 --> 1:49:08.140]  It's easy to listen, but it's hard to do.
[1:49:08.140 --> 1:49:12.140]  The American people, they always been informers.
[1:49:12.140 --> 1:49:15.140]  The American people like to inform on their neighbors.
[1:49:15.140 --> 1:49:17.140]  They always been like this.
[1:49:17.140 --> 1:49:22.140]  You know, there's very few Americans, what I'm trying to say, in the world.
[1:49:22.140 --> 1:49:24.140]  There's not many people would do what you do.
[1:49:24.140 --> 1:49:28.140]  They might knock you, but they would never have the guts to do what you do.
[1:49:28.140 --> 1:49:31.140]  They talk us in tongue lashes.
[1:49:31.140 --> 1:49:34.140]  They love to accuse.
[1:49:34.140 --> 1:49:42.140]  We need to look at ourselves individually and educate ourselves through this program
[1:49:42.140 --> 1:49:44.140]  and tell our neighbors, bring them into it.
[1:49:44.140 --> 1:49:48.140]  We will not win this war if we keep going like we do.
[1:49:48.140 --> 1:49:52.140]  I don't want to tell people to be reckless, but you've got to get past your fear
[1:49:52.140 --> 1:49:54.140]  because if you cower, the enemy is going to win.
[1:49:54.140 --> 1:49:57.140]  You've got to realize that you've got to get out of your comfort zone,
[1:49:57.140 --> 1:50:00.140]  start talking to your neighbors, start calling into talk shows.
[1:50:00.140 --> 1:50:03.140]  People of means are going to have to get involved
[1:50:03.140 --> 1:50:08.140]  because this is going to be like a Bolshevik slash Nazi mass extermination.
[1:50:08.140 --> 1:50:13.140]  There is no doubt I have top analysts on who have been analysts for the White House telling you this.
[1:50:13.140 --> 1:50:15.140]  They are really planning to do it.
[1:50:15.140 --> 1:50:19.140]  I mean, million-plus-man youth brigades?
[1:50:19.140 --> 1:50:24.140]  Yes, you said this in 1902.
[1:50:24.140 --> 1:50:28.140]  You talked about this, Mr. Jones.
[1:50:28.140 --> 1:50:31.140]  I was only reading their documents, Charles.
[1:50:31.140 --> 1:50:33.140]  Anything else you'd like to add, my friend?
[1:50:33.140 --> 1:50:36.140]  I wish these people would try to be a little bit more American.
[1:50:36.140 --> 1:50:40.140]  I wish they would take what you say to heart.
[1:50:40.140 --> 1:50:46.140]  Well, not even American and the Chinese farmers with sticks and stones are beating the military in China.
[1:50:46.140 --> 1:50:48.140]  It's close to falling half the time.
[1:50:48.140 --> 1:50:51.140]  It's just being human.
[1:50:51.140 --> 1:50:53.140]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change,

[1:53:50.140 --> 1:54:19.140]  We'll call today.
[1:54:19.140 --> 1:54:26.140]  I want to tell Charles and every other man and woman out there who has carried the torch of freedom.
[1:54:26.140 --> 1:54:29.140]  We've unlocked millions of mines.
[1:54:29.140 --> 1:54:33.140]  Congress has a 9% approval rating for a reason.
[1:54:33.140 --> 1:54:39.140]  Their left-right paradigm has been shattered.
[1:54:39.140 --> 1:54:44.140]  The world now knows they're a pack of criminals because of you.
[1:54:44.140 --> 1:54:49.140]  The mainstream media's credibility is falling apart or circulation is being destroyed.
[1:54:49.140 --> 1:54:51.140]  Our credibility is rising.
[1:54:51.140 --> 1:54:54.140]  So you really should be pleased out there.
[1:54:54.140 --> 1:54:58.140]  The enemy is moving against us right now.
[1:54:58.140 --> 1:55:01.140]  But at least now we have the initiative.
[1:55:01.140 --> 1:55:03.140]  At least we didn't stand there and just take it.
[1:55:03.140 --> 1:55:05.140]  So that means we've got a chance.
[1:55:05.140 --> 1:55:07.140]  Previously we wouldn't have had a chance.
[1:55:07.140 --> 1:55:09.140]  And remember, if God be with us, who can be against us?
[1:55:09.140 --> 1:55:10.140]  They are evil.
[1:55:10.140 --> 1:55:11.140]  They serve their father the devil.
[1:55:11.140 --> 1:55:12.140]  They're going to be defeated.
[1:55:12.140 --> 1:55:14.140]  Text Mars coming up in about 8 minutes.
[1:55:14.140 --> 1:55:16.140]  We'll have them at the 8 after.
[1:55:16.140 --> 1:55:17.140]  I want to come back in the next segment.
[1:55:17.140 --> 1:55:18.140]  Take some more of your calls.
[1:55:18.140 --> 1:55:20.140]  Later I want to hear from police and military.
[1:55:20.140 --> 1:55:21.140]  I mean, now here it is.
[1:55:21.140 --> 1:55:23.140]  National Guard to do gun confiscation.
[1:55:23.140 --> 1:55:24.140]  That's what they said in the newscast.
[1:55:24.140 --> 1:55:25.140]  Notice how they couch it.
[1:55:25.140 --> 1:55:27.140]  They're going to be helping get the guns off the streets.
[1:55:27.140 --> 1:55:28.140]  National Guard.
[1:55:28.140 --> 1:55:29.140]  Now see, first it's terror.
[1:55:29.140 --> 1:55:30.140]  Then it's crime.
[1:55:30.140 --> 1:55:32.140]  Then it's nationwide.
[1:55:32.140 --> 1:55:34.140]  I want to hear you talk about that.
[1:55:34.140 --> 1:55:35.140]  I want to get your take.
[1:55:35.140 --> 1:55:37.140]  I mean, are you going to, can you even call in and say you're against it?
[1:55:37.140 --> 1:55:38.140]  I know a lot of you are.
[1:55:38.140 --> 1:55:41.140]  Or are you so cowed and so afraid that, oh, you better not do that.
[1:55:41.140 --> 1:55:43.140]  Then they've already won.
[1:55:43.140 --> 1:55:44.140]  1-800-25-99231.
[1:55:44.140 --> 1:55:47.140]  I'm only going to spend a few minutes with Ted.
[1:55:47.140 --> 1:55:48.140]  I drug him in here.
[1:55:48.140 --> 1:55:49.140]  Ted Anderson.
[1:55:49.140 --> 1:55:52.140]  But Ted, gold is up again today.
[1:55:52.140 --> 1:55:58.140]  I mean, you were offering it a week and a half ago at 880 and now it's 970 something.
[1:55:58.140 --> 1:56:01.140]  And you've still got it locked in at a lower price than that.
[1:56:01.140 --> 1:56:04.140]  With all the uncertainty, all the things that are happening with the dollar, with crude oil,
[1:56:04.140 --> 1:56:05.140]  and this is the summer.
[1:56:05.140 --> 1:56:09.140]  We just want to challenge people again to get involved in business.
[1:56:09.140 --> 1:56:13.140]  Again, to get involved in precious metals today.
[1:56:13.140 --> 1:56:19.140]  I was looking through the news today trying to figure out why gold is up so much today again.
[1:56:19.140 --> 1:56:25.140]  And what it just amounts to is that the aid to the liquidity to the banks right now is
[1:56:25.140 --> 1:56:30.140]  just chasing the foreigners away from the U.S. dollar, dollars dropping, golds up, silver's up.
[1:56:30.140 --> 1:56:31.140]  It's kind of sad.
[1:56:31.140 --> 1:56:35.140]  It's like watching a country burn, you know?
[1:56:35.140 --> 1:56:39.140]  And you just sit back and you go, man, what could we have done to save this thing?
[1:56:39.140 --> 1:56:44.140]  And then we realize it's only the start, not just an economic collapse, but of at least
[1:56:44.140 --> 1:56:50.140]  a million man, 16 to 18 armed, quote, security forces.
[1:56:50.140 --> 1:56:52.140]  I mean, it's just Hitler-Yugin.
[1:56:52.140 --> 1:56:54.140]  It doesn't get any more obvious.
[1:56:54.140 --> 1:56:57.140]  Oh, they've got a hundred more banks.
[1:56:57.140 --> 1:57:01.140]  Just exactly like Indie Bank, sitting in line in the same position.
[1:57:01.140 --> 1:57:02.140]  They're looking to bail them out.
[1:57:02.140 --> 1:57:04.140]  What do you think is going to happen when those ones fail, too?
[1:57:04.140 --> 1:57:06.140]  I mean, it's just compounding.
[1:57:06.140 --> 1:57:08.140]  It's like dominoes, man.
[1:57:08.140 --> 1:57:09.140]  Chad, give them the offer.
[1:57:09.140 --> 1:57:12.140]  You've got the gold locked in, then lessen its trading right now.
[1:57:12.140 --> 1:57:13.140]  I do.
[1:57:13.140 --> 1:57:16.140]  I do have the Franks currently right now at 202.
[1:57:16.140 --> 1:57:17.140]  They're a great buy.
[1:57:17.140 --> 1:57:22.140]  There's no question about it.
[1:57:22.140 --> 1:57:23.140]  I'm sorry.
[1:57:23.140 --> 1:57:25.140]  It's the walking liberties at 202 per roll at 20.
[1:57:25.140 --> 1:57:27.140]  It's the Franks at 212.
[1:57:27.140 --> 1:57:30.140]  I really think it should be getting in the gold and silver at this time.
[1:57:30.140 --> 1:57:32.140]  The handwriting's on the wall.
[1:57:32.140 --> 1:57:35.140]  Anytime there's a problem, they're going to be printing more currency.
[1:57:35.140 --> 1:57:37.140]  It's going to debase what you have.
[1:57:37.140 --> 1:57:40.140]  Yeah, folks, you need to get in now before Skyrocket's more in price.
[1:57:40.140 --> 1:57:42.140]  All the money's on it going up.
[1:57:42.140 --> 1:57:43.140]  Can we guarantee that?
[1:57:43.140 --> 1:57:44.140]  No.
[1:57:44.140 --> 1:57:46.140]  Can we guarantee the dollar is going to continue to lose value?
[1:57:46.140 --> 1:57:47.140]  Absolutely.
[1:57:47.140 --> 1:57:50.140]  Saying they're going to bail out even more banks, it is just going straight down.
[1:57:50.140 --> 1:57:52.140]  The world is dumping it.
[1:57:52.140 --> 1:57:53.140]  You've got Franks.
[1:57:53.140 --> 1:57:55.140]  You've got British sovereigns in gold.
[1:57:55.140 --> 1:57:57.140]  And you've also got the silver dollars and half dollars.
[1:57:57.140 --> 1:58:01.140]  Tell them it's the Alex Jones special to get the big discount listeners.
[1:58:01.140 --> 1:58:04.140]  1-800-686-2237.
[1:58:04.140 --> 1:58:07.140]  1-800-686-2237.
[1:58:07.140 --> 1:58:13.140]  Ted, did you hear the other news about how they're going to have the National Guard do gun confiscation?
[1:58:13.140 --> 1:58:15.140]  Yeah, I was listening to your show earlier.
[1:58:15.140 --> 1:58:18.140]  It makes me cringe when I think about all this stuff that's going on.
[1:58:18.140 --> 1:58:22.140]  This country's just going straight down the tubes.
[1:58:22.140 --> 1:58:24.140]  I don't know why can't we turn this around?
[1:58:24.140 --> 1:58:25.140]  Why can't people wake up?
[1:58:25.140 --> 1:58:27.140]  It just drives me crazy.
[1:58:27.140 --> 1:58:29.140]  They will when they've got a gun in their face.
[1:58:29.140 --> 1:58:31.140]  Thanks, Ted.
[1:59:01.140 --> 1:59:08.140]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[1:59:08.140 --> 1:59:14.140]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[1:59:14.140 --> 1:59:16.140]  An inside job?
[1:59:16.140 --> 1:59:18.140]  How dare you?
[1:59:18.140 --> 1:59:24.140]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[1:59:24.140 --> 1:59:27.140]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[1:59:27.140 --> 1:59:32.140]  If the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9th Avenue.
[1:59:32.140 --> 1:59:38.140]  Truth rising. Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[1:59:38.140 --> 2:00:01.140]  It's now time to take the revolution at the next level.
[2:00:10.140 --> 2:00:13.140]  Text Mars in the next segment is going to be with us for about an hour and a half.
[2:00:13.140 --> 2:00:15.140]  We really look forward to this interview.
[2:00:15.140 --> 2:00:17.140]  We have Academy Award winner Eva Orner.
[2:00:17.140 --> 2:00:20.140]  Attached to the Dark Side Torture Film.
[2:00:20.140 --> 2:00:22.140]  One that shares Academy Award best documentary.
[2:00:22.140 --> 2:00:23.140]  Joining us again.
[2:00:23.140 --> 2:00:25.140]  She also got a new film by Hunter S. Thompson.
[2:00:25.140 --> 2:00:31.140]  And we want to talk to her about that because he talked about 9-11 making an inside job and Bush and pedophile rings.
[2:00:31.140 --> 2:00:34.140]  Let's go to Robert and then Eric, Daryl, Michelle and others.
[2:00:34.140 --> 2:00:38.140]  Robert in Texas, you're on the air. Welcome.
[2:00:38.140 --> 2:00:41.140]  Hi, Alex. I'd like to make a few points about Obama.
[2:00:41.140 --> 2:00:52.140]  The whole civilian security force or whatever, I see this as after the economic collapse, there's not going to be any jobs.
[2:00:52.140 --> 2:00:55.140]  No, no, that's what their plan is. That's what we've always laid out here.
[2:00:55.140 --> 2:01:00.140]  Exactly. Instead of going and building dams and bridges, they say it's going to be, they said this 10 years ago.
[2:01:00.140 --> 2:01:06.140]  Tattletale squads, checkpoints, they're going to give 16-year-olds machine guns.
[2:01:06.140 --> 2:01:08.140]  They're going to have down to 14-year-olds aiding them.
[2:01:08.140 --> 2:01:11.140]  I mean, it says it. Children will be running our lives.
[2:01:11.140 --> 2:01:18.140]  And it won't need to be mandatory because that's the only way people are going to support themselves.
[2:01:18.140 --> 2:01:21.140]  Yeah, it's just going to be absolutely hellish.
[2:01:21.140 --> 2:01:26.140]  I'd also like to add Obama is the ultimate example of double think.
[2:01:26.140 --> 2:01:34.140]  He's supposed to be anti-war, but he's openly calling for war in Pakistan and continued war in Afghanistan.
[2:01:34.140 --> 2:01:41.140]  So people are holding two thoughts in their mind at the same time that cancel out. It's insane.
[2:01:41.140 --> 2:01:47.140]  Well, remember that the liberals loved killing all the Serbs and de-ewing them for no reason.
[2:01:47.140 --> 2:01:49.140]  After using al-Qaeda.
[2:01:49.140 --> 2:01:56.140]  Yeah, liberals that will say, well, that's where al-Qaeda really is. They really are in Pakistan.
[2:01:56.140 --> 2:02:01.140]  So let's borrow more money from China and go over there and shoot them up.
[2:02:01.140 --> 2:02:06.140]  That's how it's always worked. The left hated me when I was exposing Bill Clinton.
[2:02:06.140 --> 2:02:10.140]  Now they love me when I'm attacking Bush. Now they're going to hate us again.
[2:02:10.140 --> 2:02:15.140]  And that's why the country's going to die and they're going to go in FEMA camps because they just can't wake up.
[2:02:15.140 --> 2:02:18.140]  Though a lot of them are starting to wake up. They're not as dumb as they used to be.
[2:02:18.140 --> 2:02:21.140]  Let's go ahead and take another call here. Thank you, Robert. Great points.
[2:02:21.140 --> 2:02:23.140]  Eric in Wisconsin. Go ahead.
[2:02:23.140 --> 2:02:24.140]  Hey, Alex. How are you doing?
[2:02:24.140 --> 2:02:25.140]  Good.
[2:02:25.140 --> 2:02:33.140]  Hey, listen, we're obviously at war. And with every good war, victory, there's always a plan behind it.
[2:02:33.140 --> 2:02:39.140]  And I really applaud what you guys have done. I've purchased several of your videos.
[2:02:39.140 --> 2:02:46.140]  And you've got a plan, though. The problem is we've got to first wake the public up that there's a problem.
[2:02:46.140 --> 2:02:48.140]  Sure. And the problem we're having...
[2:02:48.140 --> 2:02:51.140]  Listen, I see millions of groups come and go because they're always trying to have a plan.
[2:02:51.140 --> 2:02:57.140]  And always trying to first build the plan and then have everybody come get involved in their plan.
[2:02:57.140 --> 2:03:02.140]  And then it never goes anywhere. I'm just here to ring the alarm bells and then to see what people want to do about it.
[2:03:02.140 --> 2:03:07.140]  Oh, absolutely. And with Tenement Square, they didn't have a formulated plan either.
[2:03:07.140 --> 2:03:11.140]  And the protests went beautifully. But then afterward, everybody was like, now what?
[2:03:11.140 --> 2:03:15.140]  So then after that, you know, the government swooped in and...
[2:03:15.140 --> 2:03:19.140]  But that did discredit the government. And you can't take away what those valiant people did spontaneously.
[2:03:19.140 --> 2:03:21.140]  Oh, absolutely. Absolutely.
[2:03:21.140 --> 2:03:25.140]  You just don't listen. We had more of a free media then. You just don't hear about all the other Tenement Squares.
[2:03:25.140 --> 2:03:30.140]  The difference is in province after province, people who were unarmed defeat the military and police.
[2:03:30.140 --> 2:03:37.140]  And the central government is in major crisis. And they're trying to give the Chinese, the Olympics, to try to unify the country.
[2:03:37.140 --> 2:03:42.140]  The New World Order is trying to prop the country up through national pride right now.
[2:03:42.140 --> 2:03:48.140]  Oh, absolutely. And you know, the other point I was trying to make is we're on attack from two different angles.
[2:03:48.140 --> 2:03:54.140]  Not only do we have to fight for our country and for our freedom, but we also have families at the same time that we need to fight for.
[2:03:54.140 --> 2:03:59.140]  And one of the main things that we can do is become financially independent.
[2:03:59.140 --> 2:04:02.140]  Get out of debt. I'd recommend getting out of debt as quickly as possible.
[2:04:02.140 --> 2:04:03.140]  I agree. Great point.
[2:04:03.140 --> 2:04:07.140]  And, you know, you can get off the power grid by getting solar panels.
[2:04:07.140 --> 2:04:12.140]  I mean, I would get water filters and stock up on food now because, you know, even if you invest in gold,
[2:04:12.140 --> 2:04:15.140]  who knows what kind of bizarre tricks they're going to play with that.
[2:04:15.140 --> 2:04:18.140]  You can't trust these people into more. And that, you know, that's what...
[2:04:18.140 --> 2:04:23.140]  Well, if you're physically holding gold, it's a lot better than paper notes. I appreciate your call.
[2:04:23.140 --> 2:04:31.140]  Look, we need to get the will to stand up and fight tyranny.
[2:04:31.140 --> 2:04:35.140]  We have to first develop a will to stand up and resist evil.
[2:04:35.140 --> 2:04:38.140]  We have to first decide to get our hearts right and our minds right.
[2:04:38.140 --> 2:04:40.140]  Then everything else will follow. OK?
[2:04:40.140 --> 2:04:43.140]  And we have to ring the alarm bells.
[2:04:43.140 --> 2:04:48.140]  That's the number one thing is just crediting these people and exposing government-sponsored terror.
[2:04:48.140 --> 2:04:50.140]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[2:04:50.140 --> 2:04:54.140]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[2:04:54.140 --> 2:04:56.140]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[2:04:56.140 --> 2:04:59.140]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[2:04:59.140 --> 2:05:05.140]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.
[2:05:05.140 --> 2:05:09.140]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[2:05:09.140 --> 2:05:14.140]  In the Info War, prisonplanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[2:05:49.140 --> 2:05:52.140]  Hey everybody, if you're anything like me, I'll bet you like to eat.
[2:05:52.140 --> 2:05:59.140]  I like egg scrambles for breakfast, fresh homemade bread, delicious pastas like lasagna,
[2:05:59.140 --> 2:06:05.140]  I love beef stroganoff, I love chicken noodle soup, I love desserts, all kinds of entrees
[2:06:05.140 --> 2:06:07.140]  and soups and desserts and breakfast.
[2:06:07.140 --> 2:06:09.140]  I love that stuff.
[2:06:09.140 --> 2:06:12.140]  Now food prices are skyrocketing just like gasoline prices.
[2:06:12.140 --> 2:06:16.140]  I mean the gasoline prices have gone insanely high, probably going to go higher.
[2:06:16.140 --> 2:06:18.140]  Grocery prices are right on their heels.
[2:06:18.140 --> 2:06:20.140]  How are people going to be able to afford to eat?
[2:06:20.140 --> 2:06:26.140]  I found a way to buy really incredible foods like I just described at half the price of last year's grocery bill.
[2:06:26.140 --> 2:06:32.140]  For less than half of what you spent for the same amount of food last year, I can have it delivered to your door.

[2:07:48.140 --> 2:08:14.140]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show because there's a war on for your mind.
[2:08:14.140 --> 2:08:18.140]  Welcome, my friends. We've got Tex Mars with us for close to an hour and a half.
[2:08:18.140 --> 2:08:24.140]  Then we have Academy Award-winning documentary filmmaker of the taxi to the dark side as Dick Cheney called it.
[2:08:24.140 --> 2:08:27.140]  The torture camps where they torture children to death joining us.
[2:08:27.140 --> 2:08:31.140]  She's also got a new film coming out about Hunter S. Thompson.
[2:08:31.140 --> 2:08:39.140]  But we are joined for the next hour and 20 minutes or so by professor of space aeronautics and military science, Tex Mars.
[2:08:39.140 --> 2:08:45.140]  He was an officer in the Air Force. He's had a whole bunch of bestselling books.
[2:08:45.140 --> 2:08:54.140]  Not just on the New World Order and global government, but he's written the books that are only one gets chosen a year.
[2:08:54.140 --> 2:09:01.140]  The official book on how to pass the armed services military exam and all sorts of scholarly stuff.
[2:09:01.140 --> 2:09:04.140]  He's really a scholar and we've been having him on quite a bit lately.
[2:09:04.140 --> 2:09:14.140]  We're really honored to have him in the studio with us. We're blessed to have him and his wife, Wanda Mars, and their great staff over at Power of Prophecy here in Austin, Texas.
[2:09:14.140 --> 2:09:19.140]  Really serving the world with some of the best, most heartening information out there available.
[2:09:19.140 --> 2:09:25.140]  We had him on twice in the last month about mysterious monuments for the PrisonPlanet.TV viewers.
[2:09:25.140 --> 2:09:28.140]  I showed you some of the pages here on air. He's got some more today.
[2:09:28.140 --> 2:09:32.140]  We'll be showing folks here on the document cam.
[2:09:32.140 --> 2:09:40.140]  Because so much has happened today and because Texas made films about this and written books about this from the source documents,
[2:09:40.140 --> 2:09:46.140]  I wanted to first think, Tex, for being here, but then get his response to Barack Obama coming out in the speech saying,
[2:09:46.140 --> 2:09:52.140]  million-plus youth brigade armed and it's spying on the American people. They even said it.
[2:09:52.140 --> 2:09:56.140]  We know they've been setting it up and we know Obama didn't invent this. He's just the front.
[2:09:56.140 --> 2:10:03.140]  Then they've announced in Chicago they're going to use the National Guard for gun confiscation and all over they have this knock-and-talk
[2:10:03.140 --> 2:10:09.140]  where police are trying to come people's houses from Boston to Dallas to Tucson to LA under federal grants
[2:10:09.140 --> 2:10:13.140]  and they're taking blood at warrantless checkpoints now all over the country.
[2:10:13.140 --> 2:10:19.140]  They are really trying to get in our comfort zones and I wanted to get a Tex Mars take on that.
[2:10:19.140 --> 2:10:21.140]  Tex, it's a real honor to have you here.
[2:10:21.140 --> 2:10:25.140]  That's great to be with you again and it really is a momentous time.
[2:10:25.140 --> 2:10:33.140]  You know this scheme by Barack Obama is not new and as you mentioned earlier on your program,
[2:10:33.140 --> 2:10:39.140]  we go back to the Soviet era when they had the Soviet Communist youth.
[2:10:39.140 --> 2:10:47.140]  Also, remember the incredible brigades of red youth during the days of Mao Zedong
[2:10:47.140 --> 2:10:54.140]  and Hillary Rodham Clinton of all things proposed a great youth corps for America.
[2:10:54.140 --> 2:11:04.140]  So I believe that Barack is simply following in this socialist, communist line that we've seen really the last century.
[2:11:04.140 --> 2:11:10.140]  And you know they believe that if they can capture one entire generation, the youth,
[2:11:10.140 --> 2:11:15.140]  and if they can convert that youth into their way of thinking,
[2:11:15.140 --> 2:11:21.140]  into the, as Gorbachev called it, perestroika, that that will mean a total victory for them.
[2:11:21.140 --> 2:11:25.140]  And I believe that's true. Now, the interesting thing is, you know,
[2:11:25.140 --> 2:11:28.140]  we were at Brave New Books just last week and guess what?
[2:11:28.140 --> 2:11:34.140]  Much of the crowd there that's interested in exposing this that are angry are the youth.
[2:11:34.140 --> 2:11:40.140]  I think we have an incredible tide here of young people who are waking up.
[2:11:40.140 --> 2:11:44.140]  Now some of the old people, unfortunately, I'm a little older and I'm a little embarrassed
[2:11:44.140 --> 2:11:48.140]  at maybe my generation because the youth of America are beginning to say,
[2:11:48.140 --> 2:11:55.140]  hey, wait just a minute. This is an age of barbarism and we're not going to take this anymore.
[2:11:55.140 --> 2:12:03.140]  And I think the youth understand the sacrifices made by Americans in generations past.
[2:12:03.140 --> 2:12:09.140]  And they're saying we're not going to forfeit what great generations before us did.
[2:12:09.140 --> 2:12:11.140]  We're not going to forfeit those freedoms.
[2:12:11.140 --> 2:12:20.140]  But again, Barack Obama, John McCain, it doesn't matter. This is a very false dichotomy,
[2:12:20.140 --> 2:12:25.140]  this left, right spectrum. And I want people to understand something.
[2:12:25.140 --> 2:12:30.140]  People out there who are listening, as you may consider themselves as on the left side,
[2:12:30.140 --> 2:12:35.140]  okay, of center, they may believe that, well, if we get somebody like Barack Obama,
[2:12:35.140 --> 2:12:39.140]  who says he's for change, everything will be okay.
[2:12:39.140 --> 2:12:44.140]  I'm afraid that some people will go to sleep because they believe that,
[2:12:44.140 --> 2:12:47.140]  hey, we're leftist. Now we've got a leftist like us.
[2:12:47.140 --> 2:12:50.140]  But really, do they have a leftist like them?
[2:12:50.140 --> 2:12:56.140]  It was the same thing with Bush. Everybody thought it was going to be wonderful.
[2:12:56.140 --> 2:12:58.140]  Oh, and conservatives all went to sleep.
[2:12:58.140 --> 2:13:03.140]  But if you look, it is the exact policies, just different rhetoric continuing.
[2:13:03.140 --> 2:13:06.140]  And there's this huge foundation for youth brigades.
[2:13:06.140 --> 2:13:11.140]  Bush took Clinton's AmeriCorps and set up Secure Corps with the youth,
[2:13:11.140 --> 2:13:14.140]  sixth, seventh, and eighth grade, with M16s,
[2:13:14.140 --> 2:13:18.140]  training for gun confiscation. That was in major newspapers.
[2:13:18.140 --> 2:13:20.140]  Philadelphia Daily News was won.
[2:13:20.140 --> 2:13:26.140]  So this is all going on behind the scenes very quietly, but exactly.
[2:13:26.140 --> 2:13:31.140]  We have to shatter that left, right paradigm because they keep fooling us by changing horses.
[2:13:31.140 --> 2:13:36.140]  But I think, as you said earlier, one of the big things is they're afraid now
[2:13:36.140 --> 2:13:40.140]  because one of the things that Jim Tucker got out of the Trilateral Commission meeting
[2:13:40.140 --> 2:13:45.140]  a few months ago in D.C., and he had moles and got their minutes out.
[2:13:45.140 --> 2:13:49.140]  He has all those sources being in D.C. as a reporter down for 50 years,
[2:13:49.140 --> 2:13:51.140]  and he's always proven to have accurate info.
[2:13:51.140 --> 2:13:55.140]  They weren't worried about Ron Paul for president. They said he's got the youth.
[2:13:55.140 --> 2:13:59.140]  They're not getting into the communist groups or the right wing groups, the fake right wing groups.
[2:13:59.140 --> 2:14:02.140]  They are really getting into liberty, and they're talking about the Federal Reserve,
[2:14:02.140 --> 2:14:05.140]  and they are scared, and they're scared for a good reason.
[2:14:05.140 --> 2:14:09.140]  Because if we had more time, I know we could win this.
[2:14:09.140 --> 2:14:12.140]  The problem is the enemy sees we're coming at them, and so they're moving quick.
[2:14:12.140 --> 2:14:14.140]  But please continue, Tex.
[2:14:14.140 --> 2:14:18.140]  Well, with an economic catastrophe on the horizon.
[2:14:18.140 --> 2:14:23.140]  Remember during the Great Depression, Roosevelt began his Civilian Conservation Corps,
[2:14:23.140 --> 2:14:26.140]  and much of that was youth, youth.
[2:14:26.140 --> 2:14:30.140]  Now, I believe this is what is going to take place.
[2:14:30.140 --> 2:14:38.140]  If Barack Obama is president, I believe he will be, unless some 9-11 event catapults John McCain into office,
[2:14:38.140 --> 2:14:45.140]  what we will see is this will be proposed to be one of the solutions
[2:14:45.140 --> 2:14:51.140]  for these millions of American youth who can't find a job, who have no future,
[2:14:51.140 --> 2:14:55.140]  who are out there driftless because of economic calamity.
[2:14:55.140 --> 2:14:57.140]  For 15 years, you didn't just say this.
[2:14:57.140 --> 2:14:58.140]  Of course.
[2:14:58.140 --> 2:15:01.140]  And so this will be the perfect thing for Obama to say.
[2:15:01.140 --> 2:15:04.140]  Hey, youth of America, now I'm going to give you a purpose.
[2:15:04.140 --> 2:15:06.140]  I'm going to give you a goal.
[2:15:06.140 --> 2:15:08.140]  We're going to train you, indoctrinate you.
[2:15:08.140 --> 2:15:12.140]  You're going to be our youth core, our homeland security.
[2:15:12.140 --> 2:15:18.140]  And it just so happens that a trillion-dollar platform has already been built over the last 20 years for him.
[2:15:18.140 --> 2:15:23.140]  But overnight, he's got the idea, and got all these big wigs behind him in the Chicago Tribune,
[2:15:23.140 --> 2:15:29.140]  saying this is, and they say, they don't say, oh, it's mission will be helping people and some security.
[2:15:29.140 --> 2:15:34.140]  They say that there will be spies, armed spies.
[2:15:34.140 --> 2:15:35.140]  Tex, go ahead.
[2:15:35.140 --> 2:15:42.140]  Well, they believe a generation that's been built, conditioned on video games like Grand Theft Auto and such,
[2:15:42.140 --> 2:15:46.140]  and barbaric movies, the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and all these,
[2:15:46.140 --> 2:15:57.140]  they believe these people will be fit to run their Gulag concentration camps that Halliburton and KBR have built systematically over the last 10 years or so.
[2:15:57.140 --> 2:15:59.140]  So we have a generation.
[2:15:59.140 --> 2:16:05.140]  Now, what we have to do is continue to educate people, inform people, and really rattle some cages.
[2:16:05.140 --> 2:16:07.140]  Hey, Alex, I want to tell you something.
[2:16:07.140 --> 2:16:14.140]  This is just maybe symbolic, but it shows you the power of the Alex Jones show.
[2:16:14.140 --> 2:16:21.140]  You remember last week when we were on, we talked about these North American Union pyramids in West Virginia.
[2:16:21.140 --> 2:16:30.140]  Now, remember, one of the things I'd like us to talk about today is the fact that the illuminist in building this architecture around the world,
[2:16:30.140 --> 2:16:35.140]  this architectural colossus, are signaling future events.
[2:16:35.140 --> 2:16:44.140]  Now, we have in 2005, in Waco, Texas, the president of Mexico, Vicente Fox, Morton, the prime minister of Canada,
[2:16:44.140 --> 2:16:49.140]  and Bush agreeing to this pact, this North American Union, by 2010.
[2:16:49.140 --> 2:16:51.140]  Okay, this was in 2005.
[2:16:51.140 --> 2:17:01.140]  But wait, in 1995, in West Virginia were the two senators of that state, by the way, or a Rockefeller, J. Rockefeller,
[2:17:01.140 --> 2:17:11.140]  and Byrd, a 33rd degree mason, they erected three pyramids, and they used U.S. taxpayer and West Virginia taxpayer money,
[2:17:11.140 --> 2:17:15.140]  and these three pyramids are symbolic.
[2:17:15.140 --> 2:17:16.140]  They are magical.
[2:17:16.140 --> 2:17:21.140]  They are ritual, and I believe they conducted rituals in those at their inauguration.
[2:17:21.140 --> 2:17:24.140]  Well, we know it was laid down by mason, so they do a ritual cornerstone.
[2:17:24.140 --> 2:17:29.140]  Now, they placed three flags in front of them that existed to this day.
[2:17:29.140 --> 2:17:33.140]  Now, here's a photo of that. I know your TV people can see it, but those on radio.
[2:17:33.140 --> 2:17:40.140]  I want you to understand, here are three pyramids and the three flag poles flying the Mexican, the Canadian,
[2:17:40.140 --> 2:17:45.140]  and the American flag in Princeton, West Virginia.
[2:17:45.140 --> 2:17:47.140]  Now, this is interesting.
[2:17:47.140 --> 2:17:49.140]  We went on your program, we exposed this.
[2:17:49.140 --> 2:17:52.140]  This was the first time this had ever been exposed.
[2:17:52.140 --> 2:17:57.140]  Remember, this pre-sage, this was a precursor to the North American Union pact.
[2:17:57.140 --> 2:18:03.140]  Well, guess what? A good friend of my ministry sent me a new picture,
[2:18:03.140 --> 2:18:08.140]  and because of the incredible commotion that your show caused,
[2:18:08.140 --> 2:18:13.140]  they have temporarily brought down the Mexican and Canadian flags,
[2:18:13.140 --> 2:18:16.140]  and the only one that exists right now is the U.S. but-
[2:18:16.140 --> 2:18:17.140]  This is a brand new photo.
[2:18:17.140 --> 2:18:18.140]  Yeah, this is a brand new photo.
[2:18:18.140 --> 2:18:20.140]  Same place. We just showed people all three of the flags.
[2:18:20.140 --> 2:18:23.140]  Now, again, they can only do this stuff in the dark.
[2:18:23.140 --> 2:18:26.140]  They can only do this if we don't expose it.
[2:18:26.140 --> 2:18:28.140]  One person wrote me an email.
[2:18:28.140 --> 2:18:32.140]  He said, Text, what I did was, after I heard you with Alex Jones,
[2:18:32.140 --> 2:18:35.140]  I went to that place, and to my shock, it was true.
[2:18:35.140 --> 2:18:38.140]  There were the three flags flying.
[2:18:38.140 --> 2:18:44.140]  He said, I just got out of my car, I parked it, and I hoisted the two down, Mexican,
[2:18:44.140 --> 2:18:46.140]  and he said, I didn't want to damage any property.
[2:18:46.140 --> 2:18:47.140]  I didn't want to get any children.
[2:18:47.140 --> 2:18:50.140]  Good, I love it. That's like, sons of liberty were starting to get exactly.
[2:18:50.140 --> 2:18:55.140]  He said, and I folded them up very neatly and just set them down there on the sidewalk and left.
[2:18:55.140 --> 2:19:00.140]  Now, it's interesting, and then he said, I came back a week later and I took another picture.
[2:19:00.140 --> 2:19:01.140]  Guess what? They haven't put them back up.
[2:19:01.140 --> 2:19:06.140]  They're getting besieged with phone calls demanding to know why those foreign flags
[2:19:06.140 --> 2:19:09.140]  are in West Virginia at a government taxpayer-paid billing.
[2:19:09.140 --> 2:19:15.140]  But remember, even the architecture, you see, the pyramids are a sign of regeneration
[2:19:15.140 --> 2:19:17.140]  of the new order of the ages.
[2:19:17.140 --> 2:19:18.140]  It's rising.
[2:19:18.140 --> 2:19:19.140]  It's rising.
[2:19:19.140 --> 2:19:21.140]  And in fact, with the Egyptians, every time a new dynasty came in,
[2:19:21.140 --> 2:19:23.140]  they would build new monuments to it.
[2:19:23.140 --> 2:19:27.140]  And it also symbolizes the death of the old.
[2:19:27.140 --> 2:19:34.140]  So they were saying, death to America and up with the North American Union,
[2:19:34.140 --> 2:19:38.140]  which is also why they're building the big Muslim crescent moon and star.
[2:19:38.140 --> 2:19:40.140]  And in fact, we're going to get to that when we get back.
[2:19:40.140 --> 2:19:41.140]  Absolutely.
[2:19:41.140 --> 2:19:44.140]  In fact, we'll just continue to talk during the break from presentplanet.tv viewers,
[2:19:44.140 --> 2:19:48.140]  but we'll come back with the main info in four minutes. Stay with us.
[2:19:48.140 --> 2:19:53.140]  Gold. It's like nothing else on Earth. From the Romans through the Renaissance,
[2:19:53.140 --> 2:19:57.140]  from the industrial age to the space age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[2:19:57.140 --> 2:20:01.140]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[2:20:01.140 --> 2:20:06.140]  According to the World Gold Council in the U.S. Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[2:20:06.140 --> 2:20:10.140]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common sense alternative
[2:20:10.140 --> 2:20:14.140]  to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.

[2:20:53.140 --> 2:20:57.140]  I went to Ground Zero and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[2:20:57.140 --> 2:21:04.140]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[2:21:04.140 --> 2:21:13.140]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[2:21:13.140 --> 2:21:20.140]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[2:21:20.140 --> 2:21:23.140]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[2:21:23.140 --> 2:21:29.140]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

[2:21:41.140 --> 2:21:47.140]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[2:21:47.140 --> 2:21:51.140]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water,
[2:21:51.140 --> 2:21:57.140]  and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[2:21:57.140 --> 2:22:02.140]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[2:22:02.140 --> 2:22:06.140]  The KDF dual-media shower filter works with both hot and cold water,
[2:22:06.140 --> 2:22:13.140]  and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[2:22:13.140 --> 2:22:19.140]  The KDF dual-media shower filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[2:22:19.140 --> 2:22:25.140]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.

[2:23:35.140 --> 2:23:38.140]  AmericanFreePress, all one word, dot net.
[2:23:38.140 --> 2:23:42.140]  Once again, that's AmericanFreePress.net.
[2:23:42.140 --> 2:23:47.140]  American Free Press, the voice of the Second American Revolution.
[2:23:47.140 --> 2:24:03.140]  Music
[2:24:03.140 --> 2:24:08.140]  A whole section called Rothschild's Unholy Legacy in the Holy Lands.
[2:24:08.140 --> 2:24:17.140]  He's built a great pyramid in the courtyard of Hebrew University and he's built the Israeli Supreme Court.
[2:24:17.140 --> 2:24:19.140]  An incredible complex.
[2:24:19.140 --> 2:24:24.140]  There again, we have Egyptian pyramids and all kinds of Masonic numerology used therein.
[2:24:24.140 --> 2:24:32.140]  And by the way, when you come out of Egypt, the first city you come to there is called Eilat, E-I-L-A-T.
[2:24:32.140 --> 2:24:38.140]  And when you drive in, you will see a great pyramid right there in the middle of the street in the Boulevard
[2:24:38.140 --> 2:24:41.140]  with the all-seeing eye and the Masonic square and compass.
[2:24:41.140 --> 2:24:44.140]  Here again, we see signs of Rothschild.
[2:24:44.140 --> 2:24:50.140]  Rothschild, of course, was the designer of the Israeli flag in 1948, the six-pointed star.
[2:24:50.140 --> 2:24:52.140]  The seal of Solomon.
[2:24:52.140 --> 2:24:56.140]  The seal of Solomon is the hexagram of witchcraft 666.
[2:24:56.140 --> 2:24:59.140]  It is concealed within the six-pointed star.
[2:24:59.140 --> 2:25:03.140]  It's the penultimate Kabbalic symbol, isn't it?
[2:25:03.140 --> 2:25:05.140]  Oh yes, and you know the average person.
[2:25:05.140 --> 2:25:08.140]  It doesn't matter. You may have a Jewish neighbor. You tell them about this.
[2:25:08.140 --> 2:25:11.140]  They don't know anything about this. They're not plotters. They're not conspirators.
[2:25:11.140 --> 2:25:21.140]  And I believe the people of Israel are going to be great victims of this because there is a satanic sect within the Zionist at the top.
[2:25:21.140 --> 2:25:28.140]  Just like in America, the average American is patriotic to the core, but we have this small clique, this Kabbal.
[2:25:28.140 --> 2:25:32.140]  It's like the British. I mean, I've got an English name. You've got a Scottish name.
[2:25:32.140 --> 2:25:35.140]  The point is, is the government's evil there?
[2:25:35.140 --> 2:25:38.140]  We talk about the evil communist Chinese. We're not saying the Chinese are bad.
[2:25:38.140 --> 2:25:40.140]  We're saying their leaders are wicked.
[2:25:40.140 --> 2:25:45.140]  And Israel is dominated by very, very wicked people, and they have now dominated the U.S.
[2:25:45.140 --> 2:25:50.140]  Now, some people say, well, is there goal to bring Judaism to the world scene?
[2:25:50.140 --> 2:25:58.140]  Listen, their world religion is based on acceptance of all religions, a melting of all religions into one,
[2:25:58.140 --> 2:26:03.140]  but you cannot say that your religion is exclusive or better.
[2:26:03.140 --> 2:26:08.140]  Let's just take this. This is an absolute disgrace.
[2:26:08.140 --> 2:26:11.140]  What I'm showing you here, and what is pictured in mysterious monuments,
[2:26:11.140 --> 2:26:23.140]  is the taxpayer-funded monument to the victims that died on 9-11, that aircraft that crashed there near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
[2:26:23.140 --> 2:26:31.140]  Now, they have built, listen to this, an Islamic monument.
[2:26:31.140 --> 2:26:37.140]  It's an incredible thing. Remember, Arlen Specter is the senator that sort of greased this bill through Congress.
[2:26:37.140 --> 2:26:39.140]  And it even aims at Mecca.
[2:26:39.140 --> 2:26:41.140]  Well, it's oriented toward Mecca.
[2:26:41.140 --> 2:26:48.140]  And I show here, if you look at it, the crescent moon and the star, which is the sign of Islam,
[2:26:48.140 --> 2:26:51.140]  and they have designed it in the same kind of format.
[2:26:51.140 --> 2:26:55.140]  And by the way, even the name of it is called the Crescent of Embrace.
[2:26:55.140 --> 2:26:59.140]  Now, what a slap in the face to the survivors.
[2:26:59.140 --> 2:27:02.140]  And they've got the visitor center. You have to be there to see it, but I know this is laid out,
[2:27:02.140 --> 2:27:05.140]  and it's been on the news like a star right there.
[2:27:05.140 --> 2:27:13.140]  Like, you know, the red star of communism, but the crescent of Embrace because the Islamic symbol is the crescent moon.
[2:27:13.140 --> 2:27:20.140]  So here we have a slap in the face. How can they actually, and by the way, Arlen Specter is Jewish,
[2:27:20.140 --> 2:27:23.140]  but he is a 33rd degree Mason.
[2:27:23.140 --> 2:27:28.140]  And remember, it was Albert Pike, the former sovereign grand commander of Freemasonry,
[2:27:28.140 --> 2:27:35.140]  who said every Masonic temple or lodge is a temple of religion.
[2:27:35.140 --> 2:27:40.140]  But it is not the religion of either the Jews or the Christians or the Muslims or the Hindus,
[2:27:40.140 --> 2:27:44.140]  but of the great architect, Lucifer.
[2:27:44.140 --> 2:27:49.140]  Yeah, all seeing I, God. They call him the great architect. He is, in fact, Lucifer.
[2:27:49.140 --> 2:27:52.140]  And their religion is manifesting it through building.
[2:27:52.140 --> 2:27:54.140]  Through building, they call themselves the builders.
[2:27:54.140 --> 2:28:00.140]  I have a picture of a well-known, in fact, he's celebrated in all the Masonic lodges
[2:28:00.140 --> 2:28:03.140]  and by the Supreme Lodge there in Washington, D.C.
[2:28:03.140 --> 2:28:06.140]  Joseph Fort Newton, he wrote a book called The Builders.
[2:28:06.140 --> 2:28:13.140]  Did you know that the Freemasons actually claimed that a Freemason named Peleg
[2:28:13.140 --> 2:28:16.140]  was the architect of the Tower of Babel?
[2:28:16.140 --> 2:28:21.140]  What a boast! They say, we, the Masons built the Tower of Babel.
[2:28:21.140 --> 2:28:25.140]  Well, that's like the European Union building is built exactly like that.
[2:28:25.140 --> 2:28:27.140]  And they even say that's what it's supposed to be.
[2:28:27.140 --> 2:28:33.140]  And then they have, on their stamps and money, they have the image of upside-down stars flying over it.
[2:28:33.140 --> 2:28:38.140]  That's right. We have a picture here now, for your TV audience at least.
[2:28:38.140 --> 2:28:45.140]  But I want people to understand this. This is the new European, and see, it's not a community building.
[2:28:45.140 --> 2:28:46.140]  Well, it is done.
[2:28:46.140 --> 2:28:48.140]  But I mean, I see what you mean. It's not done.
[2:28:48.140 --> 2:28:51.140]  The architects are there leaving it like the biblical images.
[2:28:51.140 --> 2:28:53.140]  Yeah, this is the Tower of Babel.
[2:28:53.140 --> 2:28:56.140]  Now, remember what I said about the Illuminati signaling future events.
[2:28:56.140 --> 2:28:59.140]  They build gigantic monumental architecture.
[2:28:59.140 --> 2:29:04.140]  And remember, it takes many years to build such grandiose edifices.
[2:29:04.140 --> 2:29:10.140]  But here we have, in Europe, they have built this European community headquarters.
[2:29:10.140 --> 2:29:14.140]  And they have their 12-star flag out in front.
[2:29:14.140 --> 2:29:18.140]  And it is an unfinished Tower of Babel.
[2:29:18.140 --> 2:29:20.140]  Well, then they intend to finish the project.
[2:29:20.140 --> 2:29:25.140]  Well, I agree with you. And as you know, Tex, on their actual money, they put the ancient Tower of Babel.
[2:29:25.140 --> 2:29:31.140]  The European Union, on their handbills, has the ancient Tower of Babel, you know, the biblical representation.
[2:29:31.140 --> 2:29:33.140]  Stay there, Tex. We'll be right back.
[2:29:39.140 --> 2:29:43.140]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[2:29:43.140 --> 2:29:46.140]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[2:30:49.140 --> 2:30:53.140]  It is a big idea. A new world order.
[2:30:53.140 --> 2:30:58.140]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[2:30:58.140 --> 2:31:01.140]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[2:31:01.140 --> 2:31:04.140]  Could their objective be world domination?
[2:31:04.140 --> 2:31:10.140]  In thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[2:31:10.140 --> 2:31:15.140]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[2:31:17.140 --> 2:31:23.140]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[2:31:23.140 --> 2:31:27.140]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[2:31:27.140 --> 2:31:30.140]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[2:31:30.140 --> 2:31:33.140]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need.

[2:31:48.140 --> 2:31:54.140]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[2:31:54.140 --> 2:31:59.140]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[2:31:59.140 --> 2:32:04.140]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[2:32:04.140 --> 2:32:08.140]  This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[2:32:08.140 --> 2:32:16.140]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[2:32:16.140 --> 2:32:22.140]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[2:32:22.140 --> 2:32:28.140]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[2:32:28.140 --> 2:32:33.140]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline environment.

[2:32:47.140 --> 2:33:06.140]  We are back live. I have run into quite a few Hollywood people over the years and a lot of prominent folks have really sought me out.
[2:33:06.140 --> 2:33:10.140]  And it happened once, twice, and three times.
[2:33:10.140 --> 2:33:15.140]  You hear about Ronald Reagan, what time you give a speech, what day you give a speech, what color tie.
[2:33:15.140 --> 2:33:20.140]  They would consult with three different astrologers, Tony Blair being possessed by the spirit of the light each morning.
[2:33:20.140 --> 2:33:24.140]  We talked about that a few weeks ago with Tex and people couldn't believe it.
[2:33:24.140 --> 2:33:27.140]  They Googled it and found all the mainstream news and freaked out.
[2:33:27.140 --> 2:33:31.140]  And no times of London, BBC, you name it.
[2:33:31.140 --> 2:33:34.140]  But I don't put me stuck in all that stuff.
[2:33:34.140 --> 2:33:37.140]  I know it's dangerous. I stay away from whether it's real or not, that whole culture.
[2:33:37.140 --> 2:33:44.140]  But you know, I was born on 211-74 and separately, I guess these globalists, I guess even the police when they're looking at you at high levels,
[2:33:44.140 --> 2:33:51.140]  they go and look at when you're born and they do charts and then also the date and the numerology.
[2:33:51.140 --> 2:33:58.140]  And when I had three separate prominent people go, I've looked into your date of birth and you know, 211-74
[2:33:58.140 --> 2:34:05.140]  and you put the two and the 11 together and the 74 makes 11 and oh, this is the best number you can have for your birth.
[2:34:05.140 --> 2:34:13.140]  And then we did your chart, you know, we found out when you were born at one o'clock in the morning on this day when Mars was in the transit with this.
[2:34:13.140 --> 2:34:16.140]  But the point is, it's all gobbledygook, but they live it.
[2:34:16.140 --> 2:34:24.140]  They are literally obsessed and that's the language they operate off of and numerology and behind the scenes text was getting into it.
[2:34:24.140 --> 2:34:28.140]  Recap some what you said and then get more into it. Please text Mars.
[2:34:28.140 --> 2:34:36.140]  Well, you know, Alex, I was thinking while you were talking about that in World War II, British intelligence working with the OSS,
[2:34:36.140 --> 2:34:43.140]  which is the precursor of the CIA of the United States, did the astrological chart on Adolf Hitler and Himmler.
[2:34:43.140 --> 2:34:45.140]  Can you imagine here?
[2:34:45.140 --> 2:34:48.140]  In World War II, they're doing the astrological chart.
[2:34:48.140 --> 2:34:52.140]  They want to understand the personality of Hitler and Himmler.
[2:34:52.140 --> 2:35:00.140]  One of the things we have to understand is that the illuminous elite have this monumental architecture.
[2:35:00.140 --> 2:35:04.140]  Remember, they are empire builders and architecture is a great part of that.
[2:35:04.140 --> 2:35:07.140]  Hitler, for example, had his own personal architect.
[2:35:07.140 --> 2:35:15.140]  They say he spent more time than even war making and war planning with Albert Spear, his architect, and he had great drawings.
[2:35:15.140 --> 2:35:18.140]  Remember, he considered himself a little bit of an artist architect.
[2:35:18.140 --> 2:35:21.140]  And so he had these fantastic plans.
[2:35:21.140 --> 2:35:24.140]  Stalin also had his architects all around him.
[2:35:24.140 --> 2:35:32.140]  They tore down one of the most famous churches, just raised it to the ground in Moscow so they could build a great temple.
[2:35:32.140 --> 2:35:44.140]  To the Soviet monument with Lenin at the top, raising his hand and looking toward the prince of the power of the air, which the Bible says is Satan.
[2:35:44.140 --> 2:35:53.140]  And then Lenin, as I learned from you and I went and found it in mainline history books, he was obsessed with Lucifer and blood and death and just a complete maniac.
[2:35:53.140 --> 2:35:57.140]  And like you said, go to an island and just murder little bunny rabbits.
[2:35:57.140 --> 2:35:59.140]  Oh, he was a monster.
[2:35:59.140 --> 2:36:01.140]  He kept calling for more blood.
[2:36:01.140 --> 2:36:04.140]  But again, we have the death situation.
[2:36:04.140 --> 2:36:08.140]  Let me give people a little picture of this.
[2:36:08.140 --> 2:36:21.140]  Now, this is, and I know this is the radio, but this is the great Maltese temple of blood that has been built in Santa Domingo, the Dominican Republic, off the coast of the United States.
[2:36:21.140 --> 2:36:25.140]  Now, this is the other part of, you know, Hades on one side and there is Dominican Republic.
[2:36:25.140 --> 2:36:31.140]  They built this and they began the planning for this, Alex, in 1939.
[2:36:31.140 --> 2:36:35.140]  Now, they had the foresight to build this thing, designing.
[2:36:35.140 --> 2:36:40.140]  Remember, 1939 kicked off World War II and they began the building with this.
[2:36:40.140 --> 2:36:42.140]  And the reason this was so important.
[2:36:42.140 --> 2:36:44.140]  Remember, great bloodshed began.
[2:36:44.140 --> 2:36:47.140]  50 million people perished in World War II.
[2:36:47.140 --> 2:36:50.140]  They were planning this great temple.
[2:36:50.140 --> 2:36:54.140]  Now, in 1992, they had the grand opening of this.
[2:36:54.140 --> 2:36:55.140]  Everybody was there.
[2:36:55.140 --> 2:36:58.140]  Meanwhile, Bush is announcing 1,000 points of light simultaneously.
[2:36:58.140 --> 2:37:01.140]  All sorts of weird celebrations all over the world.
[2:37:01.140 --> 2:37:04.140]  The New Edgers are on top mountains calling in the New Age.
[2:37:04.140 --> 2:37:06.140]  The harmonic convergence met and so forth.
[2:37:06.140 --> 2:37:09.140]  They were having the great Earth Day situations.
[2:37:09.140 --> 2:37:10.140]  Now, what is this?
[2:37:10.140 --> 2:37:12.140]  It's a gigantic building.
[2:37:12.140 --> 2:37:15.140]  It's many football fields long.
[2:37:15.140 --> 2:37:17.140]  It's bigger than the U.S. Capitol building.
[2:37:17.140 --> 2:37:20.140]  It's shaped like a great Mayan temple.
[2:37:20.140 --> 2:37:26.140]  In fact, there's a great Mayan pyramid on top of it with a gigantic laser light.
[2:37:26.140 --> 2:37:29.140]  They actually create the image of the beast in the sky.
[2:37:29.140 --> 2:37:32.140]  That shines out of the torch was another Illuminati symbol.
[2:37:32.140 --> 2:37:39.140]  Remember those Mayan temples and the millions of people who were sacrificed to the sun god, to Lucifer,
[2:37:39.140 --> 2:37:45.140]  in those Mayan, Incan, Aztec temples in Meso and South Central America.
[2:37:45.140 --> 2:37:47.140]  And I'm noticing, as you said, there's no windows in this center.
[2:37:47.140 --> 2:37:50.140]  There is no window in this gigantic thing.
[2:37:50.140 --> 2:37:57.140]  But I understand that some people claim that there are many prison cells, many dungeons, torture centers in this.
[2:37:57.140 --> 2:38:04.140]  Now, when this first came to my attention, the report to me was that this is going to be used.
[2:38:04.140 --> 2:38:07.140]  People will be taken on jets, dissidents in America, okay?
[2:38:07.140 --> 2:38:15.140]  Resisters to the New World Order will be taken on jet aircraft brought here, tortured and disposed of.
[2:38:15.140 --> 2:38:19.140]  And I said, no, no, that can't, why would they take people on jet aircraft?
[2:38:19.140 --> 2:38:22.140]  Well, can you believe it?
[2:38:22.140 --> 2:38:25.140]  Extraordinary rendition is the euphemism they use.
[2:38:25.140 --> 2:38:31.140]  We're picking up people who resists the New World Order, calling them potential terrorists.
[2:38:31.140 --> 2:38:37.140]  And we now have a system, according to European reports, 39 gulags around the world.
[2:38:37.140 --> 2:38:44.140]  I want to ask the question, is this Maltese Temple of Blood inaugurated in 1992?
[2:38:44.140 --> 2:38:48.140]  Was this not a precursor to what we have today?
[2:38:48.140 --> 2:38:53.140]  Two great wars in the Middle East, maybe another one to come.
[2:38:53.140 --> 2:39:00.140]  Now, everywhere you go, the New York World Trade Centers were brought down, these two great towers.
[2:39:00.140 --> 2:39:08.140]  But prior to bringing them down, they erected four great towers with pyramidal structures on top.
[2:39:08.140 --> 2:39:13.140]  They call it the World Financial Center, and it sits right on the harbor at New York City.
[2:39:13.140 --> 2:39:19.140]  So they built four, each one being a corner of the world, the four corners of the world.
[2:39:19.140 --> 2:39:22.140]  Now, why did they bring down the two World Trade Center towers?
[2:39:22.140 --> 2:39:26.140]  This was the signal. This was the Illuminati's goal.
[2:39:26.140 --> 2:39:32.140]  They were saying it is the end of the American superiority in the World Financial Center.
[2:39:32.140 --> 2:39:37.140]  At the same time, they were planning to bring down the two World Trade Center towers,
[2:39:37.140 --> 2:39:43.140]  which would mean the end of American glory, you see, the end of the dollar.
[2:39:43.140 --> 2:39:48.140]  Over in Europe, they were building a great statue of the goddess,
[2:39:48.140 --> 2:39:53.140]  and she is holding up, and I have a picture of it in my book, she is holding up the Euro.
[2:39:53.140 --> 2:40:00.140]  And beneath her, in a supine, cowering, admiring position, are the people of the world.
[2:40:00.140 --> 2:40:04.140]  This is a statue about where is that, because I remember seeing that as incredible.
[2:40:04.140 --> 2:40:11.140]  Yeah, this is on page 57 in Mysterious Monuments.
[2:40:11.140 --> 2:40:18.140]  There is the Euro goddess, and look at her. You can see the picture, she is holding up the Euro.
[2:40:18.140 --> 2:40:21.140]  She is exalting the Euro among all the nations of the world.
[2:40:21.140 --> 2:40:27.140]  And then there is a pyramid structure made up of basically crushed people who are supine on their backs.
[2:40:27.140 --> 2:40:33.140]  And not only that, over in Berlin, Germany, they had a huge, and I have the headline in this book,
[2:40:33.140 --> 2:40:38.140]  I think that is page 40, 41, the Reichstag reborn.
[2:40:38.140 --> 2:40:41.140]  But it is not just the outside, it looks like the Reichstag,
[2:40:41.140 --> 2:40:49.140]  but inside they have a great inverse cone or pyramid down into the assembly.
[2:40:49.140 --> 2:40:54.140]  And that channels all of the Prince of the Power there, all of the energy forces
[2:40:54.140 --> 2:40:58.140]  from the cosmic gods and goddesses into the German Reichstag.
[2:40:58.140 --> 2:41:03.140]  So they added that feature, that satanic feature to the architecture of the Reichstag.
[2:41:03.140 --> 2:41:08.140]  But here again we have, and they have that in the Louvre too, pyramids on top, pyramids below,
[2:41:08.140 --> 2:41:16.140]  and then Francois Miener-Ross said, I am an occultist, and I have had this guy designed it with 666 pieces of yellow pink glass,
[2:41:16.140 --> 2:41:18.140]  and this is a power talisman.
[2:41:18.140 --> 2:41:23.140]  He was in the news saying, and it was kind of a national thing, God is he crazy, and they said no.
[2:41:23.140 --> 2:41:28.140]  I have a whole lot on the architect, I am Pi, Chinese American,
[2:41:28.140 --> 2:41:31.140]  by the way he's doing a lot of projects in red china today.
[2:41:31.140 --> 2:41:35.140]  He also, I think he was a designer of the Kennedy Center,
[2:41:35.140 --> 2:41:48.140]  but I am Pi specializes in pyramids, and he did build, and it's odd to see this ancient King Louis XIV palace,
[2:41:48.140 --> 2:41:55.140]  the Louvre Museum, and right in front of it is an Egyptian pyramid of crystal glass.
[2:41:55.140 --> 2:42:03.140]  But it's interesting that Mitterrand, according to Le Monde, that's the Paris newspaper The World in English,
[2:42:03.140 --> 2:42:09.140]  Mitterrand went to the top of a sacred mountain in the Pyrenees,
[2:42:09.140 --> 2:42:13.140]  and there he beat on drums and sat lotus-legged.
[2:42:13.140 --> 2:42:22.140]  I remember this is the president of France, he has the ability to destroy much of the world with the nuclear weapons of France.
[2:42:22.140 --> 2:42:24.140]  They got more than a thousand necks.
[2:42:24.140 --> 2:42:31.140]  And he beat the drums to evoke the spirits to come forth, and they instructed him to build a great pyramid.
[2:42:31.140 --> 2:42:36.140]  Now this is no different than an American, a billionaire named Isaac Tigret,
[2:42:36.140 --> 2:42:45.140]  who went to the great pyramid in Egypt and spent the night in the Pharaoh's King's chamber in the very middle,
[2:42:45.140 --> 2:42:52.140]  and at the stroke of midnight, according to his testimony, by the way I have a picture of Isaac Tigret in this book,
[2:42:52.140 --> 2:42:57.140]  Isaac Tigret says a great light came and a boy said to him,
[2:42:57.140 --> 2:43:00.140]  build a pyramid like this in the United States.
[2:43:00.140 --> 2:43:05.140]  So we went to the sister city of Memphis, which is Memphis, Memphis, Egypt,
[2:43:05.140 --> 2:43:09.140]  Memphis, Tennessee, and he built the great American pyramid.
[2:43:09.140 --> 2:43:10.140]  What page is that?
[2:43:10.140 --> 2:43:12.140]  I want to show them that it's amazing.
[2:43:12.140 --> 2:43:16.140]  I don't remember the page of that, but it's probably in the first 50 pages as I remember.
[2:43:16.140 --> 2:43:19.140]  624 pages, it certainly sometimes escapes me.
[2:43:19.140 --> 2:43:26.140]  There's so much here, but I believe you'll see on the right-hand side there a picture of Isaac Tigret.
[2:43:26.140 --> 2:43:32.140]  Isaac Tigret is the founder of hard rock cafes, The Chain.
[2:43:32.140 --> 2:43:37.140]  And he of course worshiped Sai Baba, the Hindu Guru and so forth.
[2:43:37.140 --> 2:43:40.140]  But he also owned the Phoenix Suns.
[2:43:40.140 --> 2:43:44.140]  Now get that sun, remember the sun god motif of the ancient mystery religions.
[2:43:44.140 --> 2:43:50.140]  And I have pictured the t-shirt they sell, and I've seen young people wearing this t-shirt.
[2:43:50.140 --> 2:43:55.140]  It says hard rock cafe, and then it's the sun, just an image of the sun.
[2:43:55.140 --> 2:43:57.140]  Here again we get to the sun god.
[2:43:57.140 --> 2:43:59.140]  By the way, here's something else.
[2:43:59.140 --> 2:44:01.140]  If you want to talk about the harbinger, there we go.
[2:44:01.140 --> 2:44:02.140]  There you see the picture.
[2:44:02.140 --> 2:44:05.140]  By the way, this is American Airlines magazine.
[2:44:05.140 --> 2:44:11.140]  And I was flying somewhere, and wow, there on the front cover is the great American pyramid.
[2:44:11.140 --> 2:44:15.140]  And see, he's telling us, it says hip and holy is the American Airlines magazine.
[2:44:15.140 --> 2:44:17.140]  And they're telling you this is religious.
[2:44:17.140 --> 2:44:22.140]  This American Airlines is saying this is a holy, these pyramids are religious, baby.
[2:44:22.140 --> 2:44:23.140]  That's right.
[2:44:23.140 --> 2:44:24.140]  And there's the government.
[2:44:24.140 --> 2:44:26.140]  Look at the t-shirt here on the left-hand side.
[2:44:26.140 --> 2:44:27.140]  This is an ad.
[2:44:27.140 --> 2:44:30.140]  I got it at an Indianapolis magazine, and look what it says at the top.
[2:44:30.140 --> 2:44:31.140]  Revolution.
[2:44:31.140 --> 2:44:32.140]  Anarchy.
[2:44:32.140 --> 2:44:33.140]  Rebellion.
[2:44:33.140 --> 2:44:34.140]  Bring the whole family.
[2:44:34.140 --> 2:44:35.140]  Bring the whole family.
[2:44:35.140 --> 2:44:36.140]  Oh, yeah.
[2:44:36.140 --> 2:44:48.140]  By the way, the interesting thing about this great pyramid is that rumors began when this was built that Isaac Tigret, this billionaire, owner of the Phoenix Suns.
[2:44:48.140 --> 2:44:51.140]  This is one of the richest guys in America.
[2:44:51.140 --> 2:45:04.140]  That Isaac Tigret had had the engineers and the builders to place a small sealed metal box right at the very apex, way up at the top, hundreds and hundreds of feet up.
[2:45:04.140 --> 2:45:09.140]  And it was rumored that that building was dedicated to the devil by Isaac Tigret.
[2:45:09.140 --> 2:45:15.140]  Now, the city fathers, this rumor got so big in Memphis, they were afraid nobody would come to the pyramid.
[2:45:15.140 --> 2:45:20.140]  They were going to have all these athletic games and so forth, and there was going to be a rock and roll museum there.
[2:45:20.140 --> 2:45:23.140]  So they said, what are we going to do to get the people to come to this?
[2:45:23.140 --> 2:45:27.140]  They're afraid that it's been dedicated to the devil in Memphis, Tennessee.
[2:45:27.140 --> 2:45:29.140]  So they made fun of it.
[2:45:29.140 --> 2:45:30.140]  Now, listen to this, Alex.
[2:45:30.140 --> 2:45:31.140]  They made fun.
[2:45:31.140 --> 2:45:36.140]  They said, can you believe these crazy people out there, conspiracy theorists, are claiming this was dedicated to the devil?
[2:45:36.140 --> 2:45:42.140]  They're claiming there was a strange box that was planted at the very top and welded down.
[2:45:42.140 --> 2:45:52.140]  So they made a big deal of it, the mayor and the city council, ha ha ha, and they sent their engineers up with the newspapers, the cameras moving in the local channels.
[2:45:52.140 --> 2:45:53.140]  Guess what?
[2:45:53.140 --> 2:45:55.140]  They said, we're going to show you there's nothing there.
[2:45:55.140 --> 2:45:57.140]  They found the box.
[2:45:57.140 --> 2:45:58.140]  They took welding torches.
[2:45:58.140 --> 2:45:59.140]  They brought it down.
[2:45:59.140 --> 2:46:02.140]  They opened it up, and boy, they were shocked.
[2:46:02.140 --> 2:46:06.140]  There was a velvet patch in there, or sorry, a bag.
[2:46:06.140 --> 2:46:09.140]  They opened up the bag and there were artifacts.
[2:46:09.140 --> 2:46:12.140]  Obviously, talismans, charms.
[2:46:12.140 --> 2:46:19.140]  It had been dedicated to his gods, just as had been rumored by the builders of that pyramid.
[2:46:19.140 --> 2:46:30.140]  Well, just like we told you in West Virginia, they had the North American Union obelisk and the pyramids and the flags, and there it is, folks.
[2:46:30.140 --> 2:46:38.140]  Again, a lot of atheists out there, the New World Order, trained people to not believe in the spiritual, but that's only because they want them to be blind so that they can control them.
[2:46:38.140 --> 2:46:48.140]  But when you get into it, I don't know a globalist who isn't completely obsessed and who in their writings doesn't admit that they're basically flopping around daily being possessed by entities.
[2:46:48.140 --> 2:46:51.140]  They believe it, whether they're schizophrenic or not.
[2:46:51.140 --> 2:46:57.140]  And as you said, they now say that their gods are telling them to kill almost everyone on earth.
[2:46:57.140 --> 2:47:01.140]  And so I want to get into their world population reduction and then go back through your other notes.
[2:47:01.140 --> 2:47:03.140]  We've got about 45 minutes left with your text.
[2:47:03.140 --> 2:47:10.140]  You really have gotten into their documents, their plans, how they created that special forces group.
[2:47:10.140 --> 2:47:14.140]  The job was to, quote, be the beast and the earth force to kill everybody.
[2:47:14.140 --> 2:47:15.140]  Yeah, the earth battalion.
[2:47:15.140 --> 2:47:17.140]  And yeah, the first earth battalion.
[2:47:17.140 --> 2:47:18.140]  Jim Shannon's earth battalion.
[2:47:18.140 --> 2:47:27.140]  Yeah, and then now they've announced, and right here at office depot in town, two stores now, we put photos up there.
[2:47:27.140 --> 2:47:30.140]  It says you've got to park around back if you've got an SUV.
[2:47:30.140 --> 2:47:34.140]  And they come out and tell you, and then it says this is dedicated to the earth and this is for the earth.
[2:47:34.140 --> 2:47:35.140]  And this is this and that.
[2:47:35.140 --> 2:47:37.140]  And of course, it all sounds reasonable.
[2:47:37.140 --> 2:47:42.140]  Meanwhile, they're the ones destroying the earth of all the toxic waste and GMO and the rest of it.
[2:47:42.140 --> 2:47:46.140]  And they're now inculcating us with an anti-human pro-death view.
[2:47:46.140 --> 2:47:50.140]  And I wanted to let people understand that that's what's guiding all of this.
[2:47:50.140 --> 2:47:53.140]  And I wanted you to speak to that and some of their monuments to death.
[2:47:53.140 --> 2:48:03.140]  You know, back in the 18th century, the French Revolution, the Illuminati, of course, engendered that incredible bloody thing with the guillotines and so forth.
[2:48:03.140 --> 2:48:07.140]  But they said we're inaugurating an age of reason.
[2:48:07.140 --> 2:48:19.140]  And they claimed that they worshiped a God of reason, not the God of the other religions, but a new God, the great architect, who would build a great new order of the ages, the God of reason.
[2:48:19.140 --> 2:48:25.140]  Now on page 21 of Mysterious Monuments, I have a picture of the Georgia guide stones.
[2:48:25.140 --> 2:48:27.140]  Now this is something that I visited.
[2:48:27.140 --> 2:48:31.140]  Here are these, it's almost like an American stone hinge.
[2:48:31.140 --> 2:48:36.140]  And I went there and I saw they had a great bronze plaque.
[2:48:36.140 --> 2:48:44.140]  And it's written in eight different languages, including English, French, Babylonian, Cuneiform, back to Babylon.
[2:48:44.140 --> 2:48:50.140]  And they said, let these be guide stones to an age of reason.
[2:48:50.140 --> 2:48:52.140]  Now remember, this is a new thing.
[2:48:52.140 --> 2:48:59.140]  This is, remember what I said, that the Illuminati elite signal future events through architecture.
[2:48:59.140 --> 2:49:04.140]  They built these Georgia guide stones near the little town of Everton, Georgia.
[2:49:04.140 --> 2:49:06.140]  They spent many millions of dollars.
[2:49:06.140 --> 2:49:15.140]  And the first of the 10 guides, these replace the 10 commandments, you see, for this new environmental world order.
[2:49:15.140 --> 2:49:29.140]  The first one says that the world must be reduced to 500 million people so that mankind will be in harmony perpetually with nature.
[2:49:29.140 --> 2:49:39.140]  Now, since there are 7 billion people on this planet, all they have to do is massacre 6.5 billion to make it a sustainable.
[2:49:39.140 --> 2:49:41.140]  They use the word sustainable.
[2:49:41.140 --> 2:49:45.140]  And they say 500 million is the most this planet can sustain.
[2:49:45.140 --> 2:49:48.140]  And now the pope came out today and said, we must be sustainable.
[2:49:48.140 --> 2:49:55.140]  All the other big, they've had both Pat Robertson and Al Sharpton get together and say, we agree.
[2:49:55.140 --> 2:50:05.140]  Newt Gainrich has come out, whose favorite people are the communists, Alvin and Heidi Toffler, saying that they are saying global warming is real.
[2:50:05.140 --> 2:50:08.140]  We've got to have a carbon tax on all human activity.
[2:50:08.140 --> 2:50:12.140]  And they say that Al Gore is going to have a 10 million man youth brigade.
[2:50:12.140 --> 2:50:16.140]  They're now recruiting who is going to enforce that as well.
[2:50:16.140 --> 2:50:19.140]  I had a good friend the other day where she worked.
[2:50:19.140 --> 2:50:22.140]  She mentioned that she didn't believe in global warming.
[2:50:22.140 --> 2:50:29.140]  And a lady that worked there, right, and they've been friends for years in the desk next door, got up and screamed at her.
[2:50:29.140 --> 2:50:31.140]  How dare you not believe in global warming?
[2:50:31.140 --> 2:50:33.140]  You're a monster.
[2:50:33.140 --> 2:50:35.140]  And started calling her names.
[2:50:35.140 --> 2:50:37.140]  And it was like a religious fervor.
[2:50:37.140 --> 2:50:38.140]  How dare you?
[2:50:38.140 --> 2:50:40.140]  You must believe in global warming.
[2:50:40.140 --> 2:50:41.140]  Don't you understand?
[2:50:41.140 --> 2:50:42.140]  We've got to save the planet.
[2:50:42.140 --> 2:50:43.140]  We've got to save.
[2:50:43.140 --> 2:50:46.140]  Well, they're now saying in the US and England that we need to be arrested.
[2:50:46.140 --> 2:50:49.140]  We'll talk behind the scenes more about this right now.
[2:50:49.140 --> 2:50:55.140]  Attention GCN listeners, would you like to watch uncensored, unregulated, even banned TV on your computer?
[2:50:55.140 --> 2:50:59.140]  Well, now you can watch satellite TV on your PC with an extremely simple hookup
[2:50:59.140 --> 2:51:04.140]  that allows computer owners to pick up more channels than any sane person can even watch
[2:51:04.140 --> 2:51:07.140]  without paying monthly cable or satellite fees.
[2:51:07.140 --> 2:51:08.140]  Here's the story.
[2:51:08.140 --> 2:51:12.140]  New video feed technology lets anyone with a high speed internet connection
[2:51:12.140 --> 2:51:16.140]  gain instant access to an endless list of underground channels from all over the globe.
[2:51:16.140 --> 2:51:17.140]  And here's the best part.
[2:51:17.140 --> 2:51:19.140]  It's 100% legal.
[2:51:19.140 --> 2:51:23.140]  And it works at home, the office, or even in other countries to grab television channels
[2:51:23.140 --> 2:51:25.140]  and video feeds at your command.
[2:51:25.140 --> 2:51:30.140]  GCN listeners can use it to watch hundreds of conspiracy videos absolutely free.
[2:51:30.140 --> 2:51:34.140]  Best of all, you could be watching free TV on your PC in five minutes or less.
[2:51:34.140 --> 2:51:35.140]  It's that simple.
[2:51:35.140 --> 2:51:39.140]  Just go to www.orderfreetv.com.
[2:51:39.140 --> 2:51:42.140]  That's www.orderfreetv.com.

[2:52:15.140 --> 2:52:21.140]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[2:52:21.140 --> 2:52:24.140]  An inside job?
[2:52:24.140 --> 2:52:28.140]  How dare you?
[2:52:28.140 --> 2:52:32.140]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[2:52:32.140 --> 2:52:35.140]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[2:52:35.140 --> 2:52:37.140]  I have not told the truth.
[2:52:37.140 --> 2:52:40.140]  In five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of...
[2:52:40.140 --> 2:52:41.140]  Truth Rising.

[2:52:49.140 --> 2:52:52.140]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[2:52:52.140 --> 2:52:55.140]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[2:52:55.140 --> 2:52:58.140]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[2:52:58.140 --> 2:53:01.140]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney.
[2:53:01.140 --> 2:53:04.140]  Finalized a contract in London and demoed our new product in Boston.
[2:53:04.140 --> 2:53:07.140]  Online from my desk with WebEx.
[2:53:07.140 --> 2:53:10.140]  WebEx lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[2:53:10.140 --> 2:53:15.140]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[2:53:15.140 --> 2:53:19.140]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[2:53:19.140 --> 2:53:21.140]  Travel less, meet online.

[2:53:59.140 --> 2:54:01.140]  Alright, before we go any further.
[2:54:01.140 --> 2:54:08.140]  I want all of you to know that we're opening the phones up in the next hour for 30 minutes.
[2:54:08.140 --> 2:54:11.140]  1-800-259-9231.
[2:54:11.140 --> 2:54:13.140]  I'm going to take a lot of calls for text Mars.
[2:54:13.140 --> 2:54:17.140]  1-800-259-9231.
[2:54:17.140 --> 2:54:19.140]  Text Mars is coming up.
[2:54:19.140 --> 2:54:22.140]  Questions about specifically the New World Order, what they're doing.
[2:54:22.140 --> 2:54:25.140]  We're just now talking about the phony environmental movement.
[2:54:25.140 --> 2:54:29.140]  Meanwhile, the globalists are destroying the earth and we're building a new one.
[2:54:29.140 --> 2:54:38.140]  But how it is a cult and they admit that this is a social unification tool in their own papers admitting it's all fake.
[2:54:38.140 --> 2:54:42.140]  It's just cynical and evil and while you're busy trying to ban carbon and tax yourself,
[2:54:42.140 --> 2:54:45.140]  they're going to go on genetic engineering and doing things that are really bad.
[2:54:45.140 --> 2:54:46.140]  Text Mars.
[2:54:46.140 --> 2:54:48.140]  Well, back to the Georgia guide stones.
[2:54:48.140 --> 2:54:55.140]  Here we have the illuminous signaling, the future of mankind, which is a catastrophe,
[2:54:55.140 --> 2:55:01.140]  which will mean the wipeout of six and a half billion people off this planet
[2:55:01.140 --> 2:55:07.140]  so they can reach their reasonable goal of 500 million sustainable population.
[2:55:07.140 --> 2:55:10.140]  So they have this in stone amazingly.
[2:55:10.140 --> 2:55:13.140]  Here we have the forensic evidence of that.
[2:55:13.140 --> 2:55:20.140]  So by the way, if we go forward, I want to mention too, as we were on the break we were talking about,
[2:55:20.140 --> 2:55:26.140]  back in the late 1980s in Colorado, Maurice Strong, head of the United Nations Environmental Program,
[2:55:26.140 --> 2:55:32.140]  met with Rothschilds, the Rockefellers and others, and there at Crestone, Colorado,
[2:55:32.140 --> 2:55:39.140]  they came up with the idea for the World Conservation Bank.
[2:55:39.140 --> 2:55:44.140]  And all of the nations of the world would put in all of their wilderness areas and everything.
[2:55:44.140 --> 2:55:52.140]  And by the way, the interesting thing about this is we then began this great process of internationalizing
[2:55:52.140 --> 2:55:58.140]  all of America's wilderness areas and national parks with the United Nations biospheres.
[2:55:58.140 --> 2:56:01.140]  And people didn't believe it, but we got the treaty agreements.
[2:56:01.140 --> 2:56:03.140]  It was a handover of that, but not just that.
[2:56:03.140 --> 2:56:08.140]  The buffer zones, and now those are all the areas they're grabbing and setting off limits.
[2:56:08.140 --> 2:56:11.140]  That's right, because nature is to be the great world religion.
[2:56:11.140 --> 2:56:14.140]  But who is the God of nature? Nature is God.
[2:56:14.140 --> 2:56:17.140]  Well, it's Pan, the horned God of the forest.
[2:56:17.140 --> 2:56:20.140]  Here again, everything goes back to these devils.
[2:56:20.140 --> 2:56:27.140]  And by the way, to indicate that, to indicate that that was the future of the world is Pan, the horned God of witchcraft.
[2:56:27.140 --> 2:56:33.140]  In London, England, and Hyde Park, which is sort of like New York Central Park,
[2:56:33.140 --> 2:56:38.140]  they have built a great statue of Pan, the horned devil God.
[2:56:38.140 --> 2:56:43.140]  A man named Epstein was this sculptor, and underneath it, there's a bronze plaque.
[2:56:43.140 --> 2:56:51.140]  Now imagine, go to London, England, go to Hyde Park, and there you have a great devil goat God statue.
[2:56:51.140 --> 2:56:56.140]  And underneath it says, Family of Man. Family of Man.
[2:56:56.140 --> 2:57:00.140]  He's head of the Family of Man, according to the Aluminist.
[2:57:00.140 --> 2:57:05.140]  And by the way, go to the National Cathedral in Washington DC and have pictures of it.
[2:57:05.140 --> 2:57:09.140]  You'll also find a devil God. There's a devil God.
[2:57:09.140 --> 2:57:13.140]  I think that's pages 388, 389 of Mysterious Monuments.
[2:57:13.140 --> 2:57:17.140]  Even Darth Vader, because the book of Daniel the Bible says,
[2:57:17.140 --> 2:57:22.140]  the last day's ruler, world king, the Antichrist, will be the God of forces.
[2:57:22.140 --> 2:57:25.140]  And there we have old Darth Vader in stone.
[2:57:25.140 --> 2:57:29.140]  It's a little comedic in a way, and yet it's symbolic.
[2:57:29.140 --> 2:57:32.140]  Well, they know it's funny for the public, but it's not for everybody else.
[2:57:32.140 --> 2:57:37.140]  And I imagine, here we have a great Gothic cathedral, the National Cathedral,
[2:57:37.140 --> 2:57:44.140]  where they had the 9-11 interfaith memorial service with all the presidents and religious leaders.
[2:57:44.140 --> 2:57:48.140]  And there's Darth Vader looking down on people, but you can't see him.
[2:57:48.140 --> 2:57:53.140]  You've got to have a telephoto lens, because these demons and devils are all up on the ledges in stone,
[2:57:53.140 --> 2:57:56.140]  looking down on a pastor's body.
[2:57:56.140 --> 2:58:01.140]  Now, I want to get back to this North American Union thing.
[2:58:01.140 --> 2:58:03.140]  What other ways have they signaled?
[2:58:03.140 --> 2:58:04.140]  Okay, let's stay there.
[2:58:04.140 --> 2:58:07.140]  We've got a one-minute break, and then we're going to come in and get into the North American Union
[2:58:07.140 --> 2:58:08.140]  and take calls.
[2:58:08.140 --> 2:58:14.140]  Text Mars, the new book, Mysterious Monuments, and Shroud the World with Magic Seduction.
[2:58:14.140 --> 2:58:19.140]  1-800-25-99-231. Get the book at infowars.com.
[2:58:19.140 --> 2:58:23.140]  Today, you can also get it with a companion video of my new film, Endgame.
[2:58:23.140 --> 2:58:26.140]  They both dovetail together. We'll be right back.
[2:58:26.140 --> 2:58:32.140]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[2:58:32.140 --> 2:58:57.140]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[2:59:02.140 --> 2:59:09.140]  We'll be right back.
[2:59:52.140 --> 2:59:54.140]  We're back live with Text Mars.
[2:59:54.140 --> 2:59:56.140]  I want to come back in the next segment to directly your calls.
[2:59:56.140 --> 2:59:59.140]  Michael, Chethie, and many others that are holding.
[2:59:59.140 --> 3:00:05.140]  1-800-25-99-231. We are live, 17th of July, 2008.
[3:00:05.140 --> 3:00:08.140]  PrisonPlanet.com and infowars.com are my websites.
[3:00:08.140 --> 3:00:14.140]  Text websites, of course, are TextMars.com, PowerProposite.com, ConspiracyWorld.com.
[3:00:14.140 --> 3:00:18.140]  New book, he's got out of the cyclopedic in size.
[3:00:18.140 --> 3:00:24.140]  Very, very important, and we hope that you will get a copy of it as I hold it up for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[3:00:24.140 --> 3:00:25.140]  Mysterious Monuments.
[3:00:25.140 --> 3:00:30.140]  Okay, how are they heralding and bringing in their North American Union?
[3:00:30.140 --> 3:00:34.140]  Three North American Union pyramids, a structure they've built.
[3:00:34.140 --> 3:00:40.140]  But interestingly enough, remember, a facet of this North American Union is the ending of American sovereignty,
[3:00:40.140 --> 3:00:43.140]  the bringing in of a new currency, the Amaro.
[3:00:43.140 --> 3:00:48.140]  Now, they have actually built an entire new U.S. Mint in Fort Worth, Texas.
[3:00:48.140 --> 3:00:53.140]  And here are the pictures of it for your TV site.
[3:00:53.140 --> 3:00:58.140]  Here again, what do we have? We have a great circle indicating the whole world falls under the sway of what?
[3:00:58.140 --> 3:01:00.140]  Well, the men of the pyramid.
[3:01:00.140 --> 3:01:02.140]  The pyramid is the very center.
[3:01:02.140 --> 3:01:05.140]  So that's the all-seeing eye above the world, architecturally.
[3:01:05.140 --> 3:01:09.140]  That's right. Here's an aerial view, and both of these shots, by the way, are in Mysterious Monuments.
[3:01:09.140 --> 3:01:13.140]  Here we have, notice the great pyramid on top of the circle of the world.
[3:01:13.140 --> 3:01:17.140]  This is where I believe the Amaro is going to be printed.
[3:01:17.140 --> 3:01:19.140]  Everything must be made new.
[3:01:19.140 --> 3:01:23.140]  This is between Dallas and Fort Worth, Texas.
[3:01:23.140 --> 3:01:27.140]  I went there, I took some of these pictures, and by the way, I did some research.
[3:01:27.140 --> 3:01:32.140]  And I called and talked to the architectural office that designed this building.
[3:01:32.140 --> 3:01:37.140]  And I said, by the way, the architect in charge, might he have been a Freemasoner?
[3:01:37.140 --> 3:01:39.140]  They said, yes, how did you know?
[3:01:39.140 --> 3:01:42.140]  And he designed this building on Masonic principles.
[3:01:42.140 --> 3:01:47.140]  That's what they told me at the U.S. Office of Bureau of Engraving.
[3:01:47.140 --> 3:01:50.140]  They don't even hide it. No, they thought it was a great idea.
[3:01:50.140 --> 3:01:55.140]  And by the way, they said that they wanted an actual all-seeing eye there at the gate.
[3:01:55.140 --> 3:01:58.140]  But for some reason, management said no to that.
[3:01:58.140 --> 3:02:02.140]  So they got all everything. I guess that was a little bit too much.
[3:02:02.140 --> 3:02:07.140]  So the Amaro, a new U.S. printing. Tell folks about this.
[3:02:07.140 --> 3:02:11.140]  All right, now we talk about the greatest sex cult in the world.
[3:02:11.140 --> 3:02:14.140]  Now, I know this is vulgar. This is grotesque.
[3:02:14.140 --> 3:02:18.140]  But these men actually believe in sexual ritual.
[3:02:18.140 --> 3:02:21.140]  You've got the breast ritual right here. You've got the phallus.
[3:02:21.140 --> 3:02:25.140]  Yeah, well, this is the new state capital of the state of Florida.
[3:02:25.140 --> 3:02:29.140]  Remember, Jeb Bush was the governor when this thing was built.
[3:02:29.140 --> 3:02:35.140]  And architectural. Now, architects themselves, one of the most popular websites,
[3:02:35.140 --> 3:02:40.140]  chose this as the most sexual piece of architecture in the world.
[3:02:40.140 --> 3:02:45.140]  It's the state capital of Florida. And what it is, it's the man's testicles and the man's phallus.
[3:02:45.140 --> 3:02:48.140]  Can you believe the state capital of Florida?
[3:02:48.140 --> 3:02:52.140]  They can say that's breast, too. Yeah, but it's the testicles and the...
[3:02:52.140 --> 3:02:55.140]  And they admit this. It's real funny to them. That's a sex cult.
[3:02:55.140 --> 3:02:59.140]  Well, it is a sex cult. And they're dominant in sex.
[3:02:59.140 --> 3:03:04.140]  They believe in killing the majority of us so we can't procreate because that's magical to them.
[3:03:04.140 --> 3:03:06.140]  So it's also a great greeting to kill you.
[3:03:06.140 --> 3:03:12.140]  There is a sex ritual, of course, in such secret societies as the Bohemian Grove, the Order of Skeleton Bones.
[3:03:12.140 --> 3:03:15.140]  Oh, by the way, speak of the devil. That's going on right now.
[3:03:15.140 --> 3:03:19.140]  Oh, yeah, the Bohemian Grove. They're down there worshiping their great owl that you exposed.
[3:03:19.140 --> 3:03:23.140]  And having your video out. And having man-on-man intercourse.
[3:03:23.140 --> 3:03:29.140]  Yeah, that's a terrible thing. But even the 15 young men initiated in the Order of Skeleton Bones,
[3:03:29.140 --> 3:03:36.140]  in mysterious monuments, I actually show the original layout of the city of New Haven.
[3:03:36.140 --> 3:03:40.140]  Now, remember, the word New Haven means the New Heaven.
[3:03:40.140 --> 3:03:45.140]  This is where the educational center of the world was going to be. Would you believe?
[3:03:45.140 --> 3:03:49.140]  Well, Mason's founded Niederwald, which means underworld outside Austin. But sorry, go ahead.
[3:03:49.140 --> 3:03:57.140]  Well, here we have, and by the way, this is a 1797, dated 1797, a drawing of the city plan.
[3:03:57.140 --> 3:04:02.140]  It shows a nine square city because concealed in the number nine is 666.
[3:04:02.140 --> 3:04:07.140]  But in the very center of the city, they show it will be the town cemetery.
[3:04:07.140 --> 3:04:11.140]  The center is the center of death of New Haven, Connecticut, where Yale University.
[3:04:11.140 --> 3:04:16.140]  Well, they also admit Yale admits the town, the university's laid out as a skull and cross bones.
[3:04:16.140 --> 3:04:21.140]  It is. You will see in the original layout, you will see a skull and bones.
[3:04:21.140 --> 3:04:28.140]  And this comes from the book. It is the diary of Ezra Styles. He was a high level freemason.
[3:04:28.140 --> 3:04:35.140]  And he was one of the first presidents of Yale College. And he actually showed, here is our city.
[3:04:35.140 --> 3:04:45.140]  And by the way, right next to the town cemetery is the tomb, the resident for the skull and bones of the 15 young men initiated here.
[3:04:45.140 --> 3:04:47.140]  A devil cult runs our society.
[3:04:47.140 --> 3:04:55.140]  I was 2001 along with hundreds of my fellow troops. I went to grounds here and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[3:04:55.140 --> 3:05:02.140]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[3:05:02.140 --> 3:05:11.140]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[3:05:11.140 --> 3:05:18.140]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[3:05:18.140 --> 3:05:27.140]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown. He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

[3:05:45.140 --> 3:05:54.140]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent? How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfate, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[3:05:54.140 --> 3:06:00.140]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.

[3:08:34.140 --> 3:08:38.140]  Thanks in closing. You were talking about how they signal future events that we're going to cause.
[3:08:38.140 --> 3:08:55.140]  Through architecture and through symbology and even through the currency. In 1935, Franklin Roosevelt, then the 32 degree Mason, and his secretary of agriculture, who was the 33rd degree Mason, Henry Wallace, they had a plan and they changed the currency of the United States.
[3:08:55.140 --> 3:09:08.140]  The first time in 1935, it was finally admitted to the public that there was a reverse, a secret hidden side. They called it the great secret side. That's right. You can be shown the pyramid. It's on the $1 bill.
[3:09:08.140 --> 3:09:30.140]  The great pyramid of Egypt, the all-seeing eye of the sun god, or Lucifer, and the words Novus Ordo Seclorum. 1935. And guess what? Exactly, exactly six years later, great human sacrifice and blood, Pearl Harbor, the inauguration into the World War II era of the United States.
[3:09:30.140 --> 3:09:44.140]  The number six, six years after we had the great sign of Osiris and Horus, the great sun god and his son, and the pyramid, we had unleashed this great American death, a period, with Pearl Harbor.
[3:09:44.140 --> 3:09:53.140]  So everything is signal in advance. The Georgia guide stones saying we intend to catapult the world into this new order and there will be great death.
[3:09:53.140 --> 3:10:04.140]  So this was the secret seal that can only be shown to the slaves in 1935. That's right. And they'd already had the seal made turn of the century, 30 years plus before, if I remember the story correctly.
[3:10:04.140 --> 3:10:11.140]  But then they finally even had a little display and said, look, ah, you can see this now. Let's go ahead and show folks.
[3:10:11.140 --> 3:10:16.140]  Yes, origins actually go all the way back to Ben Franklin and Thomas Jefferson, but it was kept hidden.
[3:10:16.140 --> 3:10:24.140]  Yeah, but I just see a documentary where they showed when they had the one minute that they had at the Capitol, I believe, and there was another side they showed everybody.
[3:10:24.140 --> 3:10:36.140]  Yeah, they call this the obverse side. I think it's quite interesting. By the way, even the great eagle itself is a sign of empire and over the eagle, you will see a six pointed star, the hexagram.
[3:10:36.140 --> 3:10:46.140]  It's not just a star. It is the six pointed star, the the the hexagram that is used to put a curse on things. So I want to ask a question.
[3:10:46.140 --> 3:10:55.140]  Did they place a curse on the United States with this great hexagram placed over the eagle on our dollar bill?
[3:10:55.140 --> 3:11:02.140]  But again, all of this is mirrored in architecture. These people have these unheavenly visions.
[3:11:02.140 --> 3:11:11.140]  And two that the United Nations building was built on Egyptian satanic architectural principles, worshiping the God shoe.
[3:11:11.140 --> 3:11:24.140]  And he have a picture of that in mysterious monuments. The United Nations Secretariat building and predictably shortly after the United Nations was formed, the Korean War ensued and great death and bloodshed.
[3:11:24.140 --> 3:11:35.140]  So so bloodshed and death follows architecture. And I think we can see the plans of the Illuminati, the grand design that Manly P Hall 33 degree Mason called it.
[3:11:35.140 --> 3:11:46.140]  The grand design is revealed in architecture unknown to the average person, but known only to the higher level.
[3:11:46.140 --> 3:11:54.140]  Here are a bunch of heropods and initiates. OK, amazing information and a lot of it is covered in mysterious monuments.
[3:11:54.140 --> 3:12:02.140]  You can also at infowars.com to get mysterious monuments to get the first part, which is, of course, Codex Magica, just as thick, just as amazing.
[3:12:02.140 --> 3:12:06.140]  And briefly, tell folks what's covered in Codex Magica for those that don't have it text.
[3:12:06.140 --> 3:12:12.140]  Well, Codex Magica is another huge book with a thousand photographs and illustrations.
[3:12:12.140 --> 3:12:20.140]  Codex Magica is the same size as mysterious monuments, but it covers the Illuminati and the elite and all of the secret societies, including Freemasonry.
[3:12:20.140 --> 3:12:35.140]  Their secret hand signs, their secret rituals done in plain sight on television and magazines and newspapers, how they actually contort their bodies and handshakes, symbols, signs, the meaning of these.
[3:12:35.140 --> 3:12:38.140]  And it's just amazing what you find.
[3:12:38.140 --> 3:12:43.140]  And, Tex, you've been me. When did you really leg up to the New World Order 20 years ago?
[3:12:43.140 --> 3:12:48.140]  Well, I believe, yeah, I can almost, I remember it just knocked me down when I discovered it.
[3:12:48.140 --> 3:12:55.140]  You know, I really pointed back. I had done much exposing the New Age movement and it's a cultic place.
[3:12:55.140 --> 3:12:57.140]  Infiltrating Christianity, that led you back.
[3:12:57.140 --> 3:13:05.140]  Yeah, well, I had a young man, a tremendously brilliant guy. He worked for a high tech. I'll just tell you, worked for IBM, an engineer.
[3:13:05.140 --> 3:13:09.140]  He graduated from Yale University. He came to visit me and he was a Christian man.
[3:13:09.140 --> 3:13:17.140]  He says, Tex, I know you've done all this study of the occult and mystery Babylon and the ancient religions, but are you aware of the secret societies?
[3:13:17.140 --> 3:13:25.140]  And he said, I studied the order of skull and bones when I was a student at Yale University and I said, well, tell me what you know.
[3:13:25.140 --> 3:13:31.140]  And he did. And by the way, he had written a dissertation while he was at Yale University.
[3:13:31.140 --> 3:13:35.140]  Roger Javins was his name. And he said, here, I want you to see this.
[3:13:35.140 --> 3:13:39.140]  That propelled me into this incredible study of secret societies.
[3:13:39.140 --> 3:13:41.140]  That took you behind the curtain, behind the curtain.
[3:13:41.140 --> 3:13:46.140]  Well, it did. And I'd say that was about 22 years ago now, today.
[3:13:46.140 --> 3:13:52.140]  And that's why mysterious monuments and Codex Magica are based on over 20 years of research.
[3:13:52.140 --> 3:13:58.140]  That's where I was going is that this is really, I don't want to say you're penultimate because you're going to do a lot more.
[3:13:58.140 --> 3:14:05.140]  But this is really the sum or the, you know, the essence of your work and research.
[3:14:05.140 --> 3:14:11.140]  And it's so important that people have these. We're going to your calls, but I do want to draw a picture for people. Very simple.
[3:14:11.140 --> 3:14:16.140]  Then the globalist, their symbols also the pyramid, the Illuminati, because it's a symbol of compartmentalization.
[3:14:16.140 --> 3:14:19.140]  We're the big mass down here at the bottom and then they're the illuminated ones on top.
[3:14:19.140 --> 3:14:27.140]  But to make it more simple in squares, you see this, you're in a box and we'll show people a close shot of this.
[3:14:27.140 --> 3:14:33.140]  You, you think you, you know, see everything, but, but, but really you're Republican or you're a Democrat.
[3:14:33.140 --> 3:14:40.140]  You've got this limited view. And then meanwhile, you have no idea that you are part of a larger structure.
[3:14:40.140 --> 3:14:45.140]  There are other people who have their own views and their own ideas and their own systems of thought.
[3:14:45.140 --> 3:14:52.140]  And there's even different cults and different groups that think they have all the answers and different, you know, organizations and governments and strata.
[3:14:52.140 --> 3:15:03.140]  And the Illuminati, they have unlimited funding. They are just masters at having their people with different levels of knowledge controlling all these strata with corporate management systems.
[3:15:03.140 --> 3:15:08.140]  And that's why they're in control. They know they're the builders. They're the architects. They don't have to lay all this out.
[3:15:08.140 --> 3:15:18.140]  They pay attention to detail. And that's why they say you're profane and deserve to die because you can't even figure out that you are limited and blinded down to the point of not even able to see outside this box.
[3:15:18.140 --> 3:15:25.140]  So I don't claim that you have to believe everything I'm saying or what Texas is saying, though I trust and know what Texas is saying is accurate because I've studied what he's reported.
[3:15:25.140 --> 3:15:32.140]  I just want you to realize you are in a box. And all of us are to a certain extent, you know, we're fine out. We're not infinite like God.
[3:15:32.140 --> 3:15:38.140]  The Illuminati tries to play God, but they use systems and mechanisms and mathematics to try to mimic it.
[3:15:38.140 --> 3:15:44.140]  And it's a joke compared to what God does. I mean, even a joke is saying too much.
[3:15:44.140 --> 3:15:51.140]  But compared to what we as individuals do, it is John marveled at the beast. And that's the whole system.
[3:15:51.140 --> 3:15:58.140]  And so that's what we're facing here. I want to go to calls, but briefly, how the compartmentalization operates.
[3:15:58.140 --> 3:16:04.140]  Well, Alex, we have some tremendous people out there that are exposing different facets of this. And I commend them.
[3:16:04.140 --> 3:16:09.140]  For example, there are people out there that are studying the Jesuit order, the order of the Jesuits, which is a Catholic order.
[3:16:09.140 --> 3:16:18.140]  Or the Knights of Malta or Opus die. Others really focus their attention on the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission, or Freemasonry.
[3:16:18.140 --> 3:16:29.140]  Now, you know, I'm glad for all these things, but they get so focused on the one group, they forget, as you just did, that the pyramid has many stars.
[3:16:29.140 --> 3:16:37.140]  They have many facets. And listen, they will end one if the Bohemian grove is exposed too much, they'll end it and start another one.
[3:16:37.140 --> 3:16:44.140]  So they're not beyond this incredible proliferation of secret societies and groups.
[3:16:44.140 --> 3:16:52.140]  So we need to understand that if a person says, oh, no, it's only the Jesuits. It's only the Vatican. It's only this. It's only the Zionist.
[3:16:52.140 --> 3:17:00.140]  No, no, no. These people have created a system where everything concrets together. It fits together.
[3:17:00.140 --> 3:17:09.140]  And as you just said, they are the capstone and they're going to crown this monumental system, even this architectural colossus.
[3:17:09.140 --> 3:17:14.140]  And everything is being built now and the ultimate is coming up.
[3:17:14.140 --> 3:17:21.140]  And I believe that the year 2009, for example, will be a very important year because 2 times 9 equals 18.
[3:17:21.140 --> 3:17:26.140]  And 18 is 6 plus 6 plus 6. Is that ridiculous? Of course it's ridiculous.
[3:17:26.140 --> 3:17:32.140]  It's absurd, but they believe it. The Aluminist actually believe it.
[3:17:32.140 --> 3:17:45.140]  And they have their lower level subordinates, let's just call them. The George Bushes, the Chenees, the Old Merits, the Browns, and so forth to do their bidding.
[3:17:45.140 --> 3:17:48.140]  All of these people are servants themselves.
[3:17:48.140 --> 3:17:53.140]  Absolutely. Let's take a call. And was he going to break? We'll take calls behind the scenes as well.
[3:17:53.140 --> 3:17:59.140]  Let's talk to Cheffie in London first. You're on the air with TexMars Worldwide.
[3:17:59.140 --> 3:18:00.140]  Hello?
[3:18:00.140 --> 3:18:01.140]  Yes, go ahead.
[3:18:01.140 --> 3:18:04.140]  Hi. Sorry, this is the first time.
[3:18:04.140 --> 3:18:10.140]  Basically, there was a couple of points I needed to mention. The first one was in respect. I'm actually a Muslim from London.
[3:18:10.140 --> 3:18:17.140]  Wait, wait, Texas is getting his headset on and they're having a malfunction. Let me help you with them. Keep talking, Cheffie.
[3:18:17.140 --> 3:18:23.140]  Yeah, hello. Basically, I just wanted to thank your guest and yourself for all the work that you've done.
[3:18:23.140 --> 3:18:33.140]  But there was just a couple of points I wanted to mention. One was in respect to the star and the crescent, which many people today actually state it's a true Islamic symbol.
[3:18:33.140 --> 3:18:39.140]  Its origins are actually from Constantinople, when the Muslims took Constantinople in 1453.
[3:18:39.140 --> 3:18:41.140]  That's right. They adopted the symbol of the city.
[3:18:41.140 --> 3:18:46.140]  The symbol of Constantinople was the star and the crescent.
[3:18:46.140 --> 3:18:52.140]  Well, hold on a minute. Now, that's true, but they liked the sign because they already liked the moon.
[3:18:52.140 --> 3:18:55.140]  Muhammad came from a tribe that were moon worshippers.
[3:18:55.140 --> 3:19:01.140]  No, this is actually about six or seven thousand years preceding that.
[3:19:01.140 --> 3:19:06.140]  We can debate these issues, but there was a couple of other things I wanted to mention as well.
[3:19:06.140 --> 3:19:11.140]  Constantinople isn't 8,000 years old, sir.
[3:19:11.140 --> 3:19:18.140]  No, it's about 7,000 years old. Actually, I mean, if you actually go into the history of it, the symbol is itself.
[3:19:18.140 --> 3:19:22.140]  We're going to keep talking behind the scenes with you for all the Prison Planet.tv viewers.
[3:19:22.140 --> 3:19:25.140]  Final second one text coming up. Fine.
[3:19:25.140 --> 3:19:30.140]  I mean, we're just here talking about how it is now a Muslim symbol today.
[3:19:30.140 --> 3:19:33.140]  It's on top of the mosque and it's on the flags.
[3:19:33.140 --> 3:19:37.140]  And the point is, is that they're making the memorial that out in Shanksville.
[3:19:37.140 --> 3:19:40.140]  So that's not debatable. We'll find out exactly what you're getting at here.
[3:19:40.140 --> 3:19:43.140]  Man, this hour and a half has gone by so fast. Your call straight ahead.
[3:19:43.140 --> 3:19:46.140]  Michelle, John, Morgan, others, stay there chipping.
[3:19:46.140 --> 3:19:50.140]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[3:19:50.140 --> 3:19:55.140]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999,
[3:19:55.140 --> 3:20:02.140]  reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years.
[3:20:02.140 --> 3:20:09.140]  The U.S. economy receives its currency by taking on debt through private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[3:20:09.140 --> 3:20:13.140]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[3:20:13.140 --> 3:20:17.140]  It's bad enough that the U.S. citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[3:20:17.140 --> 3:20:23.140]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[3:20:23.140 --> 3:20:27.140]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.

[3:21:48.140 --> 3:21:54.140]  no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.

[3:24:19.140 --> 3:24:22.140]  I can only talk about my own personal experience.
[3:24:22.140 --> 3:24:29.140]  I just want to point out again to anybody who's new to listening to your show that I am a U.S. veteran.
[3:24:29.140 --> 3:24:40.140]  I served it partly in my country, the U.S. Army, the whole Iraq War thing, but I have a spirit of discernment and I went with my heart.
[3:24:40.140 --> 3:24:44.140]  Many times what's asked to re-up is what they call it, understand the military and do that.
[3:24:44.140 --> 3:24:48.140]  But I just knew I had to go with the spirit and just really go out there and do the right thing.
[3:24:48.140 --> 3:24:53.140]  But I was talking to you about how the police checks are going on and things of that nature.
[3:24:53.140 --> 3:25:02.140]  Even when I went to my local mall, which was about two weeks ago, I got confronted by the local mall police as well as the city police.
[3:25:02.140 --> 3:25:03.140]  And they were in there.
[3:25:03.140 --> 3:25:11.140]  And I made the comment to him saying that you essentially, you sharing a show, how this is a Nazi kind of operation,
[3:25:11.140 --> 3:25:15.140]  and he got completely upset with me and walked away.
[3:25:15.140 --> 3:25:20.140]  But it blew my mind because I thought to myself, this is real.
[3:25:20.140 --> 3:25:24.140]  I'm a soldier, or former soldier, a veteran, and this is how they treat me.
[3:25:24.140 --> 3:25:29.140]  They didn't know that. They didn't know that. But it doesn't matter.
[3:25:29.140 --> 3:25:34.140]  They're turning the heat up slowly. Michelle, call me back another day when there's not a guest and tell me more about this.
[3:25:34.140 --> 3:25:36.140]  It's everywhere, boss.
[3:25:36.140 --> 3:25:41.140]  When I was in D.C., there'd be crowds of tourists just in the middle of a park and cops would come over and yell at them.
[3:25:41.140 --> 3:25:47.140]  And was there to let you know that you're a slave and now it's happening everywhere, Tex?
[3:25:47.140 --> 3:25:52.140]  Well, you know, a lady like Michelle, who has served this country and deserves respect,
[3:25:52.140 --> 3:26:01.140]  can you believe that President Bush and John McCain opposed, violently opposed, the GI Bill, the Education Act?
[3:26:01.140 --> 3:26:03.140]  And here these people are throwing on their limbs.
[3:26:03.140 --> 3:26:08.140]  They don't want to pay for their college because, you know, they want to keep them entrapped in the military.
[3:26:08.140 --> 3:26:11.140]  They're afraid too many may get out and go to college.
[3:26:11.140 --> 3:26:16.140]  This was just horrible, the treatment through the Veterans Administration and everything.
[3:26:16.140 --> 3:26:19.140]  I'm sorry, I'm getting on a tangent here.
[3:26:19.140 --> 3:26:26.140]  But after a 20-year career in the Air Force, people deserve more respect from our government.
[3:26:26.140 --> 3:26:28.140]  And I'll tell you something else.
[3:26:28.140 --> 3:26:35.140]  Our men and women who served in Iraq and Afghanistan deserve to know the truth about 9-11.
[3:26:35.140 --> 3:26:40.140]  And it is unpatriotic to oppose the truth-telling.
[3:26:40.140 --> 3:26:42.140]  Absolutely, you know what?
[3:26:42.140 --> 3:26:49.140]  They are the unpatriots, we're the patriots because we're saying we want to know for the sake of our men and women
[3:26:49.140 --> 3:26:55.140]  who have lost limbs and lives and sacrificed in the Iraq war in Afghanistan.
[3:26:55.140 --> 3:26:58.140]  We want them to know what the truth is about 9-11.
[3:26:58.140 --> 3:27:00.140]  I'm sorry, I just got a little upset about that.
[3:27:00.140 --> 3:27:02.140]  No, no, I agree. They treat them like absolute crap.
[3:27:02.140 --> 3:27:04.140]  They're even denying them health care now, as you know.
[3:27:04.140 --> 3:27:05.140]  Yeah.
[3:27:05.140 --> 3:27:07.140]  Have you heard of the VA budget?
[3:27:07.140 --> 3:27:11.140]  Have you heard 35-year employees, even managers at Jam, are being told no health care?
[3:27:11.140 --> 3:27:15.140]  They have contracts saying they're supposed to get it, and they say no.
[3:27:15.140 --> 3:27:19.140]  Across America, health care is being cut out by corporations.
[3:27:19.140 --> 3:27:25.140]  And now it's going to be government, which is going to sound good, but then that's going to be eugenics.
[3:27:25.140 --> 3:27:30.140]  That's right, they're pushing people, and now people are going to say, hey, Obama, President Obama or President McCain,
[3:27:30.140 --> 3:27:34.140]  we've got to have health care now, and of course they're absolutely right.
[3:27:34.140 --> 3:27:38.140]  And now they'll be able to do what the government is going to do what they want with you and tell the doctors what to do
[3:27:38.140 --> 3:27:40.140]  so they can carry out eugenics.
[3:27:40.140 --> 3:27:43.140]  I apologize to John and Morgan and others. We just don't have time to get to you.
[3:27:43.140 --> 3:27:46.140]  We are out of time. I have an Academy Award winner coming up.
[3:27:46.140 --> 3:27:51.140]  Talk about two films she's doing, and it's just been absolutely amazing having Tex in here.
[3:27:51.140 --> 3:27:57.140]  Tex, give people the toll-free number so they can call and get a free copy.
[3:27:57.140 --> 3:28:00.140]  Sign up for your newsletter. They get it free all year every month.
[3:28:00.140 --> 3:28:02.140]  Tell them how they can call and get a free copy of that.
[3:28:02.140 --> 3:28:05.140]  Oh yeah, we'll give them the special edition on Mysterious Monuments.
[3:28:05.140 --> 3:28:07.140]  It has a lot of pictures in it and such.
[3:28:07.140 --> 3:28:15.140]  No cost at all. Absolutely free. Just call us toll-free, 1-800-234-9673.
[3:28:15.140 --> 3:28:18.140]  Give us your address. Nobody will ask for a penny from you.
[3:28:18.140 --> 3:28:26.140]  Of course, the book is available through infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, and powerproxy.com.
[3:28:26.140 --> 3:28:32.140]  But the free newsletter, hey, they don't have to buy anything. Just call 1-800-234-9673.
[3:28:32.140 --> 3:28:37.140]  Absolutely, and I really do hope that listeners will get Tex Barnes' book.
[3:28:37.140 --> 3:28:42.140]  You can also call toll-free and get it 888-253-3139.
[3:28:42.140 --> 3:28:49.140]  Also, get in-game. People need to see that film. That film's really waking people up if you haven't gotten a DVD of in-game.
[3:28:49.140 --> 3:28:53.140]  This information is very damaging to the New World Order, and who knows how long you'll be able to get it.
[3:28:53.140 --> 3:28:57.140]  I mean, don't take these shows and the internet and radio and books and films for granted.
[3:28:57.140 --> 3:29:04.140]  Go to infowars.com or call toll-free and get Mysterious Monuments. Get in-game. Get my new film, Truth Rising.
[3:29:04.140 --> 3:29:08.140]  They all need to be seen, and you need to realize that you're the solution.
[3:29:08.140 --> 3:29:12.140]  Look in the mirror. It's you that's going to fight the New World Order and wake up hearts and minds.
[3:29:12.140 --> 3:29:17.140]  They're out recruiting their people right now. We've got to recruit ours 888-253-3139.
[3:29:17.140 --> 3:29:22.140]  Or you can see all my films online right now at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:29:22.140 --> 3:29:26.140]  We're going to come back with Eva Orner. Want to thank Tex Mars. Thanks. It was incredible.
[3:29:26.140 --> 3:29:28.140]  Thank you, Alex. God bless you.
[3:29:28.140 --> 3:29:34.140]  Just absolutely amazing. I'm going to twist Tex's arm and get him back in the next month or two to really take a lot of calls.
[3:29:34.140 --> 3:29:36.140]  God bless you all.
[3:29:36.140 --> 3:29:57.140]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:06.140 --> 3:30:11.140]  History and the Bible prove to them that these two systems, church and state, must be kept separate.
[3:30:11.140 --> 3:30:15.140]  It must be our love of God and of country that prompts or constrains us.
[3:30:15.140 --> 3:30:18.140]  This will change the character, not civil enforcement.
[3:30:18.140 --> 3:30:23.140]  From history we saw that when church and state united, known as Papal Rome, religious intolerance resulted.
[3:30:23.140 --> 3:30:26.140]  This union would go directly contrary to the great principles of our nation.
[3:30:26.140 --> 3:30:29.140]  America and Papal Rome are uniting in this agenda.
[3:30:29.140 --> 3:30:32.140]  Protestant America, awake before it is too late.
[3:30:32.140 --> 3:30:34.140]  The prophecies are fast fulfilling.
[3:30:34.140 --> 3:30:41.140]  Jesus is coming soon for free materials call 888-211-1715 or write the Bible says,
[3:30:41.140 --> 3:30:45.140]  Box 99, Lenore City, Tennessee 37771.
[3:30:45.140 --> 3:30:50.140]  Do you still think that $4 a gallon at the gas pump is your worst problem in this country?
[3:30:50.140 --> 3:30:57.140]  Bank failures, rising food prices and an ever-weakening dollar are only the beginning of a much larger crisis.
[3:30:57.140 --> 3:31:02.140]  Why have America's politicians abandoned the rule of law in favor of the rule of men?
[3:31:02.140 --> 3:31:10.140]  The majority of this nation's elected officials have become drunk on the power and illusion of authority that only lawless men and women seek.
[3:31:10.140 --> 3:31:17.140]  They no longer strive to protect American ideals, but rather they have abandoned the very rulebook that they have sworn an oath to defend.
[3:31:17.140 --> 3:31:20.140]  Will the American people let these crimes go unpunished?
[3:31:20.140 --> 3:31:24.140]  Do the American people even understand the crimes that have been committed?
[3:31:24.140 --> 3:31:26.140]  Where does it stop?
[3:31:26.140 --> 3:31:32.140]  Washington You're Fired is a film about true change in DC with true solutions to our everyday problems.
[3:31:32.140 --> 3:31:35.140]  We invite you to get your copy today.
[3:31:35.140 --> 3:31:37.140]  Visit WashingtonYou'reFired.com.
[3:31:37.140 --> 3:31:41.140]  Understanding what has happened is key to fixing our problems.
[3:31:41.140 --> 3:31:45.140]  Visit WashingtonYou'reFired.com and understand true change today.
[3:31:45.140 --> 3:31:48.140]  May I have everybody's attention please?
[3:31:48.140 --> 3:31:53.140]  I've come with a message of information. 9-11 was an inside job.
[3:31:53.140 --> 3:31:55.140]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[3:31:55.140 --> 3:31:58.140]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state?
[3:31:58.140 --> 3:32:02.140]  It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the C.A.C.R.
[3:32:02.140 --> 3:32:04.140]  Release it out of the shadow.
[3:32:04.140 --> 3:32:11.140]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[3:32:11.140 --> 3:32:17.140]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[3:32:17.140 --> 3:32:21.140]  An inside job? How dare you?
[3:32:21.140 --> 3:32:27.140]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[3:32:27.140 --> 3:32:30.140]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[3:32:30.140 --> 3:32:36.140]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[3:32:36.140 --> 3:32:42.140]  Since rising, download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[3:32:42.140 --> 3:32:52.140]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[3:33:13.140 --> 3:33:19.140]  Well, for the next 30 minutes, Eva Orner is our guest, Academy Award-winning documentary filmmaker,
[3:33:19.140 --> 3:33:24.140]  of taxi to the dark side, the torture and mass murder of children,
[3:33:24.140 --> 3:33:30.140]  knowing they were totally innocent just to create the image that they were fighting Al C.I.A. to.
[3:33:30.140 --> 3:33:36.140]  And I want to get a recap from her about the aftermath of the film coming out, winning the Academy Award.
[3:33:36.140 --> 3:33:42.140]  Now Morris come out, you've got the big international association of doctors, generals of the military,
[3:33:42.140 --> 3:33:45.140]  and our own government saying it's high treason, that it's all war crimes,
[3:33:45.140 --> 3:33:50.140]  so really vindicated, validated, vindicated in the right word, because they were always right,
[3:33:50.140 --> 3:33:55.140]  and everybody pretty much commended them, but validated in spades.
[3:33:55.140 --> 3:34:01.140]  But also she's here because coming out is Gonzo, the life and work of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson.
[3:34:01.140 --> 3:34:06.140]  And it's also narrated by Johnny Depp.
[3:34:06.140 --> 3:34:12.140]  Eva Orner just is involved in so much fine work, I met her when she was here working on a documentary,
[3:34:12.140 --> 3:34:17.140]  kind of covering the 9-11 truth movement with us, but she's not here to talk about that today.
[3:34:17.140 --> 3:34:21.140]  And so we have her with us, and later we're going to play a clip of Hunter S. Thompson talking about 9-11,
[3:34:21.140 --> 3:34:23.140]  making an inside job.
[3:34:23.140 --> 3:34:27.140]  I'd also interviewed some of his friends who said before he died he was working on stories about Bush
[3:34:27.140 --> 3:34:32.140]  and pedophile rings and gay porn stars and the rest of it, which came out in the news later.
[3:34:32.140 --> 3:34:34.140]  We're in the White House, you know, the gay porn stars.
[3:34:34.140 --> 3:34:38.140]  But Eva Orner, it's very nice to have you on with us.
[3:34:38.140 --> 3:34:40.140]  Hey, Alex, how you doing?
[3:34:40.140 --> 3:34:42.140]  It's getting crazier and crazier.
[3:34:42.140 --> 3:34:48.140]  They're announcing National Guard do house-to-house gun confiscation, just nonchalantly in America.
[3:34:48.140 --> 3:34:56.140]  Obama's calling for a million-man Stasi force, and it's just everything is insane.
[3:34:56.140 --> 3:34:59.140]  It certainly is, it certainly is.
[3:34:59.140 --> 3:35:02.140]  But, you know, I'm just glad I get to make movies.
[3:35:02.140 --> 3:35:06.140]  Yeah, and going to dangerous places like Afghanistan and China and the rest of it.
[3:35:06.140 --> 3:35:09.140]  Tell us about Gonzo. Let's get into that first.
[3:35:09.140 --> 3:35:14.140]  We actually made Gonzo at the same time as we were making Taxi to the Dark Side,
[3:35:14.140 --> 3:35:18.140]  which was a really interesting thing to be doing at the same time.
[3:35:18.140 --> 3:35:22.140]  And I think in a lot of ways it really helped us with making Taxi because it was,
[3:35:22.140 --> 3:35:26.140]  well, it's not a light film by any means. It's definitely a lot lighter than, you know,
[3:35:26.140 --> 3:35:29.140]  the subject of torture, which we covered in Taxi.
[3:35:29.140 --> 3:35:32.140]  So we kind of, we made them concurrently.
[3:35:32.140 --> 3:35:37.140]  And, you know, it's a film about, you know, the great late Hunter S. Thompson,
[3:35:37.140 --> 3:35:43.140]  you know, who's one of the finest journalists and writers that has come out of America,
[3:35:43.140 --> 3:35:47.140]  you know, I would say comfortably the last 50 to 100 years.
[3:35:47.140 --> 3:35:51.140]  And we were approached to make it after he killed himself.
[3:35:51.140 --> 3:35:54.140]  We started making it. The first thing we shot was actually his,
[3:35:54.140 --> 3:35:59.140]  his ashes scattering that Johnny Depp organized at his house in Woody Creek,
[3:35:59.140 --> 3:36:01.140]  at Hunter's house in Woody Creek.
[3:36:01.140 --> 3:36:05.140]  And then, you know, we had unprecedented access to all of Hunter's estate.
[3:36:05.140 --> 3:36:07.140]  You know, he was in an incredible hoarder.
[3:36:07.140 --> 3:36:10.140]  So we had access to all of this incredible archival material.
[3:36:10.140 --> 3:36:14.140]  And we had an incredible team of researchers who went through it all and put it together.
[3:36:14.140 --> 3:36:19.140]  And, you know, it's just a really comprehensive look at the pinnacle of his career,
[3:36:19.140 --> 3:36:22.140]  which was when he wrote in the late 60s and early 70s,
[3:36:22.140 --> 3:36:25.140]  when he wrote Hell's Angels, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,
[3:36:25.140 --> 3:36:30.140]  and Fear and Loathing on the campaign trail, and some seminal articles as well.
[3:36:30.140 --> 3:36:32.140]  While you were, and I want to talk about the film,
[3:36:32.140 --> 3:36:35.140]  and it's getting great reviews by The New York Times and others,
[3:36:35.140 --> 3:36:39.140]  just congratulations. You've got, you've hit the zeitgeist, Eva Orner,
[3:36:39.140 --> 3:36:42.140]  make so many films before this that are great as well.
[3:36:42.140 --> 3:36:46.140]  Well, we have to also credit the person that I worked with that whole time,
[3:36:46.140 --> 3:36:50.140]  who's really the force behind these films, which is the great director Alex Gibney,
[3:36:50.140 --> 3:36:53.140]  who also directed Taxi to the Dark Side.
[3:36:53.140 --> 3:36:56.140]  And of course, he also, before that, made the Enron film.
[3:36:56.140 --> 3:37:01.140]  Exactly. He's a really amazing force to be reckoned with. He's an incredible filmmaker.
[3:37:01.140 --> 3:37:04.140]  Well, he also, I mean, not just as a filmmaker, he picks great topics,
[3:37:04.140 --> 3:37:07.140]  great, great subjects, you know, great things to cover.
[3:37:07.140 --> 3:37:10.140]  Yeah, he definitely knows how to get in trouble.
[3:37:10.140 --> 3:37:14.140]  Man, I can't wait to see this.
[3:37:14.140 --> 3:37:19.140]  It's going to be next year impossible to see it at any of the film festivals.
[3:37:19.140 --> 3:37:21.140]  How are we going to be able to see this?
[3:37:21.140 --> 3:37:26.140]  Gonzo came out on July 4 in 25 cities across the country,
[3:37:26.140 --> 3:37:30.140]  and I was just checking with your producer, and it is on in Austin at the minute, actually.
[3:37:30.140 --> 3:37:32.140]  Well, guys, we're going to have to go see this.
[3:37:32.140 --> 3:37:35.140]  I also want to see that movie about the Huns.
[3:37:35.140 --> 3:37:38.140]  We've been so busy, they want to scurry off and watch Batman.
[3:37:38.140 --> 3:37:41.140]  I don't particularly want to. And Jason can't go.
[3:37:41.140 --> 3:37:44.140]  I don't really want to watch Ultimate Fighting Saturday.
[3:37:44.140 --> 3:37:47.140]  But, yeah, no, I want to go see it. So, well, fantastic.
[3:37:47.140 --> 3:37:50.140]  Tell us more about the film.
[3:37:50.140 --> 3:37:54.140]  So, I mean, the thing about Hunter, I think, when people think about Hunter,
[3:37:54.140 --> 3:37:58.140]  Tomson, a lot of people have very preconceived ideas about, you know,
[3:37:58.140 --> 3:38:01.140]  he was a big partyer, he hung out with a lot of celebrities,
[3:38:01.140 --> 3:38:04.140]  or a lot of celebrities hung out with him.
[3:38:04.140 --> 3:38:06.140]  You know, he took a copy of Amount of Drugs,
[3:38:06.140 --> 3:38:09.140]  a very famous amount of alcohol and drugs that he took.
[3:38:09.140 --> 3:38:13.140]  And, you know, what we did was actually make a film that got a really,
[3:38:13.140 --> 3:38:15.140]  it's a lot of fun and it's a great film to watch,
[3:38:15.140 --> 3:38:19.140]  but it's actually really serious in its tone,
[3:38:19.140 --> 3:38:23.140]  and it's a great history lesson and a great recount of history.
[3:38:23.140 --> 3:38:26.140]  And we actually start the film with a really, you know,
[3:38:26.140 --> 3:38:31.140]  our, what's the word, I guess, our style of, you know,
[3:38:31.140 --> 3:38:33.140]  a dig at the current U.S. administration.
[3:38:33.140 --> 3:38:37.140]  Before Hunter killed himself, he wasn't terribly prolific
[3:38:37.140 --> 3:38:41.140]  for the last years of his life, but he was writing a blog for ESPN,
[3:38:41.140 --> 3:38:46.140]  and he wrote this incredible blog in response to 9-11
[3:38:46.140 --> 3:38:48.140]  as he was watching it happen on television,
[3:38:48.140 --> 3:38:51.140]  and he really predicted what was going to happen.
[3:38:51.140 --> 3:38:54.140]  He predicted that George Bush was going to, you know, declare martial law,
[3:38:54.140 --> 3:38:57.140]  and he kind of predicted, you know, the Patriot Act,
[3:38:57.140 --> 3:38:59.140]  and all of this amazing stuff.
[3:38:59.140 --> 3:39:02.140]  So we actually start the film with that, and Johnny Depp's reading it,
[3:39:02.140 --> 3:39:05.140]  because Johnny Depp played Hunter in the Terry Gilliam movie,
[3:39:05.140 --> 3:39:07.140]  Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.
[3:39:07.140 --> 3:39:09.140]  So Johnny Depp narrates the film as Hunter,
[3:39:09.140 --> 3:39:13.140]  and we only use Hunter's actual written words as narration in the film.
[3:39:13.140 --> 3:39:15.140]  So it's sort of very artful and lovely.
[3:39:15.140 --> 3:39:21.140]  But, you know, the film starts with his scathing account of what was happening in America,
[3:39:21.140 --> 3:39:25.140]  and then it goes back and kind of traces his career from, you know,
[3:39:25.140 --> 3:39:28.140]  from his early days as a young journalist and writer,
[3:39:28.140 --> 3:39:34.140]  all the way through to being like a pop culture sort of icon until his death.
[3:39:34.140 --> 3:39:36.140]  But, you know, I think one of the best parts of the film,
[3:39:36.140 --> 3:39:39.140]  and one of my favorite parts of the film is when we cover the great books
[3:39:39.140 --> 3:39:43.140]  that he wrote Fear and Loathing on the campaign trail in 1972,
[3:39:43.140 --> 3:39:46.140]  and we, you know, George McGovern features very heavily in that section,
[3:39:46.140 --> 3:39:50.140]  and we cover the Eagles and Affair, and, you know, Gary Hart talks about it,
[3:39:50.140 --> 3:39:53.140]  and, you know, there's some really great people in the film that we interviewed.
[3:39:53.140 --> 3:39:58.140]  So it's definitely, there's definitely someone in the film for every audience member.
[3:39:58.140 --> 3:40:01.140]  Yeah, it's really, I think it's a great film.
[3:40:01.140 --> 3:40:04.140]  I've been sitting in a lot of audiences lately.
[3:40:04.140 --> 3:40:07.140]  I was just in Australia where it premiered in the Sydney Film Festival,
[3:40:07.140 --> 3:40:10.140]  and I was doing a whole lot of Q&As in LA the last few weeks,
[3:40:10.140 --> 3:40:14.140]  and audiences are responding incredibly well to the film.
[3:40:14.140 --> 3:40:17.140]  Why do you think so many celebrities and people at the time
[3:40:17.140 --> 3:40:20.140]  like Hunter S. Thompson's writing?
[3:40:20.140 --> 3:40:24.140]  You know, I think if you've read his writing and you're familiar with his writing,
[3:40:24.140 --> 3:40:29.140]  it's so, it's so fresh and so unique and so exciting,
[3:40:29.140 --> 3:40:32.140]  and even now, you know, some of it, you know, 50 years old,
[3:40:32.140 --> 3:40:36.140]  and it's 50, you know, 40, 40, 45 years old.
[3:40:36.140 --> 3:40:39.140]  It's so powerful and dynamic,
[3:40:39.140 --> 3:40:43.140]  and while so many people have tried to copy, you know, his Gonzo style,
[3:40:43.140 --> 3:40:46.140]  it still is incredibly fresh.
[3:40:46.140 --> 3:40:50.140]  It's honest, it's irreverent, it's funny, it's angry.
[3:40:50.140 --> 3:40:54.140]  It's really, it's just so unusual and so dynamic,
[3:40:54.140 --> 3:40:56.140]  and I think that's what appeals to it.
[3:40:56.140 --> 3:40:59.140]  I mean, it's so funny because obviously from my accent,
[3:40:59.140 --> 3:41:01.140]  people can tell that I'm originally from Australia.
[3:41:01.140 --> 3:41:04.140]  Well, I grew up with Hunter S. Thompson books laying around,
[3:41:04.140 --> 3:41:06.140]  as my mom's a big fan, and I read quite a few of them,
[3:41:06.140 --> 3:41:08.140]  and I do think a lot of it was great info.
[3:41:08.140 --> 3:41:11.140]  What I liked is how he also changed, you know, as he got more info.
[3:41:11.140 --> 3:41:15.140]  I mean, he clearly at the end knew that the Bush administration was a pedophile cult,
[3:41:15.140 --> 3:41:17.140]  and I've talked to his friends and witnesses and people that, you know,
[3:41:17.140 --> 3:41:20.140]  he wrote things to, and he was getting ready to do a big piece on that.
[3:41:20.140 --> 3:41:23.140]  He also began to believe it was a total inside job.
[3:41:23.140 --> 3:41:30.140]  As other prominent writers also believed,
[3:41:30.140 --> 3:41:35.140]  of course the famous author of Slaughterhouse 5 got in contact with me before he died,
[3:41:35.140 --> 3:41:38.140]  but then wouldn't come on the show for some reason, Kurt Vonnegut,
[3:41:38.140 --> 3:41:41.140]  and said it was an inside job and commended my films.
[3:41:41.140 --> 3:41:45.140]  So it's really amazing to know that he had woken up to that before he died,
[3:41:45.140 --> 3:41:47.140]  and so had Kurt Vonnegut.
[3:41:47.140 --> 3:41:50.140]  I just wish they would have said more before they died.
[3:41:50.140 --> 3:41:54.140]  With the material you ran into, did you see him from saying they're going to use this
[3:41:54.140 --> 3:41:58.140]  to make us a police state to him then waking up as they blew up the towers?
[3:41:58.140 --> 3:42:01.140]  No. I mean, we really didn't go into that,
[3:42:01.140 --> 3:42:04.140]  and we honestly didn't come across anything like that.
[3:42:04.140 --> 3:42:06.140]  Well, let me play an audio clip right now.
[3:42:06.140 --> 3:42:08.140]  Here's Hunter S. Thompson.
[3:42:08.140 --> 3:42:10.140]  This is about a year before he died. Here it is.
[3:42:10.140 --> 3:42:17.140]  The first question I have is basically to get from you a sense of how you would rate
[3:42:17.140 --> 3:42:22.140]  the American media in their coverage of the events of the attack last September.
[3:42:22.140 --> 3:42:27.140]  What's your assessment of how the American media has performed?
[3:42:27.140 --> 3:42:29.140]  Well, let's see.
[3:42:29.140 --> 3:42:32.140]  Shamefully is a word that comes to mind,
[3:42:32.140 --> 3:42:35.140]  but that's not true in the case of...
[3:42:35.140 --> 3:42:37.140]  Well, it depends.
[3:42:37.140 --> 3:42:41.140]  There are papers in the New York Times watching them post,
[3:42:41.140 --> 3:42:48.140]  and all the American journalism, I think, was cowed, has been cowed and intimidated
[3:42:48.140 --> 3:42:56.140]  by this massive flag-sucking, this patriotic orgy that the White House keeps whipping up.
[3:42:56.140 --> 3:43:00.140]  You know, if you criticize the president, it's unpatriotic,
[3:43:00.140 --> 3:43:03.140]  and there's something wrong with you, you may be a terrorist.
[3:43:03.140 --> 3:43:08.140]  And I've been raving against this from the very beginning,
[3:43:08.140 --> 3:43:12.140]  but I don't have much of a constant national platform now
[3:43:12.140 --> 3:43:14.140]  because I've been working on this book, King of Fear,
[3:43:14.140 --> 3:43:18.140]  which really describes what's going on over here, the King of Fear.
[3:43:18.140 --> 3:43:24.140]  So in that sense, Hunter S. Thompson, there's not enough room for dissenting voices?
[3:43:24.140 --> 3:43:26.140]  There's plenty of room.
[3:43:26.140 --> 3:43:30.140]  People are willing to take the risk.
[3:43:30.140 --> 3:43:36.140]  It's just sort of a herd mentality, a lemming-like mentality.
[3:43:36.140 --> 3:43:41.140]  The flow, you're anti-American, and therefore a suspect.
[3:43:41.140 --> 3:43:44.140]  I may see this before any patriotic friendlies.
[3:43:44.140 --> 3:43:51.140]  And wartime, you know, they declare it's very convenient having an undeclared war
[3:43:51.140 --> 3:43:59.140]  that you can call a war and impose military tribunals and wartime security.
[3:43:59.140 --> 3:44:05.140]  And then we've got these generals telling us that this war is going to go on
[3:44:05.140 --> 3:44:07.140]  for a long, long time.
[3:44:07.140 --> 3:44:09.140]  Maybe it's not just so much the generals.
[3:44:09.140 --> 3:44:12.140]  Now, the generals are a little afraid to invade Iraq.
[3:44:12.140 --> 3:44:14.140]  A little worried about it.
[3:44:14.140 --> 3:44:16.140]  But it's the civilians in the White House.
[3:44:16.140 --> 3:44:22.140]  It's a gang of leaving just lobbyists for the military industrial complex.
[3:44:22.140 --> 3:44:24.140]  You know, this is a 10-minute clip.
[3:44:24.140 --> 3:44:27.140]  I meant to cut it down before airtime, and I think we're going to have time to play it all.
[3:44:27.140 --> 3:44:30.140]  But he goes in, they say, you know, did this help the Bush administration?
[3:44:30.140 --> 3:44:31.140]  He says, absolutely, it helped him.
[3:44:31.140 --> 3:44:33.140]  Yeah, it's really suspicious.
[3:44:33.140 --> 3:44:37.140]  He posted on the web again at prisonplanet.com for folks that want to hear it.
[3:44:37.140 --> 3:44:39.140]  But, and it's actually an hour-long interview.
[3:44:39.140 --> 3:44:41.140]  This is a 10-minute cut down.
[3:44:41.140 --> 3:44:45.140]  But then, yeah, I talked to one of the editors at a major Canadian paper,
[3:44:45.140 --> 3:44:46.140]  who was friends with him.
[3:44:46.140 --> 3:44:47.140]  I talked to others.
[3:44:47.140 --> 3:44:50.140]  I got some of his correspondences where he was saying, yeah, they blew those buildings up,
[3:44:50.140 --> 3:44:51.140]  controlled demolitions.
[3:44:51.140 --> 3:44:52.140]  I'm going to go public about it.
[3:44:52.140 --> 3:44:54.140]  And then he supposedly committed suicide.
[3:44:54.140 --> 3:44:57.140]  And I know his son was home at the time and didn't see it happen,
[3:44:57.140 --> 3:44:59.140]  but said, yeah, it looked like he killed himself.
[3:44:59.140 --> 3:45:04.140]  But obviously, Eva, you've heard the people that are out there who are suspicious
[3:45:04.140 --> 3:45:08.140]  that Hunter S. Thompson didn't kill himself, though he always talked about
[3:45:08.140 --> 3:45:10.140]  how he was going to kill himself.
[3:45:10.140 --> 3:45:14.140]  So, I mean, you think it's pretty clear he did kill himself?
[3:45:14.140 --> 3:45:19.140]  Yeah, I mean, we've actually got footage in the film of him with his long-time collaborator
[3:45:19.140 --> 3:45:23.140]  and illustrator Ralph Steadman when he was quite young visiting a morgue
[3:45:23.140 --> 3:45:26.140]  and pre-planning his funeral with him.
[3:45:26.140 --> 3:45:29.140]  You know, he'd always, always, always talked about killing himself
[3:45:29.140 --> 3:45:31.140]  when the time was right.
[3:45:31.140 --> 3:45:32.140]  It was going to happen.
[3:45:32.140 --> 3:45:37.140]  So, I don't actually think that there's, you know, any evidence to dispute that.
[3:45:37.140 --> 3:45:39.140]  You know, he was at home with his family.
[3:45:39.140 --> 3:45:41.140]  Why did he want to kill himself?
[3:45:41.140 --> 3:45:43.140]  I mean, was that him trying to take control of his life at the end or?
[3:45:43.140 --> 3:45:44.140]  I mean, yeah.
[3:45:44.140 --> 3:45:48.140]  I mean, I think he'd always had this crazy death wish.
[3:45:48.140 --> 3:45:50.140]  And he'd always talked about it since he was really young and healthy.
[3:45:50.140 --> 3:45:54.140]  But when he died, he was in failing health.
[3:45:54.140 --> 3:45:58.140]  I mean, he was a guy who'd been really, you know, so productive and so amazing
[3:45:58.140 --> 3:46:00.140]  and so talented and so successful.
[3:46:00.140 --> 3:46:03.140]  However, he was a huge drinker and a huge drug taker,
[3:46:03.140 --> 3:46:05.140]  and his health was starting to fail him.
[3:46:05.140 --> 3:46:10.140]  And I just think it just got to a point where he just couldn't take it anymore.
[3:46:10.140 --> 3:46:13.140]  So, it was no, you know, it was no huge surprise,
[3:46:13.140 --> 3:46:17.140]  although all of his long-time amazing friends who talk in the film and family
[3:46:17.140 --> 3:46:22.140]  all say something that, to me, is another really powerful part of the film.
[3:46:22.140 --> 3:46:26.140]  You know, and I think Jimmy Buffett, the really talented musician, actually says,
[3:46:26.140 --> 3:46:29.140]  you know, it's fun reminiscing about him.
[3:46:29.140 --> 3:46:32.140]  It's fun talking about him, but, you know, I really miss him.
[3:46:32.140 --> 3:46:37.140]  And the most tragic thing is that he could have wielded a pretty powerful sword
[3:46:37.140 --> 3:46:39.140]  right now against what's going on in this country.
[3:46:39.140 --> 3:46:43.140]  Well, yeah, so many people respect him that he could have really exposed what happened.
[3:46:43.140 --> 3:46:45.140]  And I think he would have been the type when the Democrats get it
[3:46:45.140 --> 3:46:47.140]  and carry out the same tyranny.
[3:46:47.140 --> 3:46:48.140]  I think he would have spoken.
[3:46:48.140 --> 3:46:51.140]  He was pretty across the board like that.
[3:46:51.140 --> 3:46:55.140]  And I think also the other thing that I really like about the film
[3:46:55.140 --> 3:46:59.140]  whenever I do press screenings and stuff is it sort of feels to me like the end of the film
[3:46:59.140 --> 3:47:01.140]  kind of is incredibly inspiring.
[3:47:01.140 --> 3:47:07.140]  And I feel like it's a call to arms to young journalists to get a bit of gonzo
[3:47:07.140 --> 3:47:11.140]  and start asking tough questions and writing articles
[3:47:11.140 --> 3:47:14.140]  that are madly critical about what's going on.
[3:47:14.140 --> 3:47:17.140]  And, you know, and just, you know, really start messing with people.
[3:47:17.140 --> 3:47:22.140]  You know, I was watching George Bush's press conference that he did yesterday.
[3:47:22.140 --> 3:47:26.140]  And I was watching the media just asking these incredibly lame questions.
[3:47:26.140 --> 3:47:31.140]  And just, you know, someone should just break out and go a little crazy.
[3:47:31.140 --> 3:47:33.140]  Well, that's why I agree.
[3:47:33.140 --> 3:47:34.140]  But you've done a great job.
[3:47:34.140 --> 3:47:36.140]  I can't wait to see this film, Taxi to the Dark Side.
[3:47:36.140 --> 3:47:39.140]  I saw that at the Arbor here in Austin and it just blew me away.
[3:47:39.140 --> 3:47:40.140]  And I bet that's where this is showing.
[3:47:40.140 --> 3:47:42.140]  I kept waiting for it to come out.
[3:47:42.140 --> 3:47:46.140]  And then suddenly it's that interview, even I'm like, you inform me it's out.
[3:47:46.140 --> 3:47:49.140]  But I'm going to go run off and see it as soon as...
[3:47:49.140 --> 3:47:52.140]  I think you'll like it.
[3:47:52.140 --> 3:47:59.140]  Well, I was totally blown away by your last film, Taxi to the Dark Side.
[3:47:59.140 --> 3:48:01.140]  And I do want to try to get the director on as well,
[3:48:01.140 --> 3:48:05.140]  because he witnessed also so much of the information as well.
[3:48:05.140 --> 3:48:08.140]  What is it like winning an Academy Award?
[3:48:08.140 --> 3:48:11.140]  Well, it's pretty good fun, Alex.
[3:48:11.140 --> 3:48:16.140]  You can take it, you know, the comms.
[3:48:16.140 --> 3:48:18.140]  No, it was a really, you know, magical experience.
[3:48:18.140 --> 3:48:21.140]  And it was even better and sweeter for us,
[3:48:21.140 --> 3:48:24.140]  because we made a film that really a lot of people didn't want us to make.
[3:48:24.140 --> 3:48:27.140]  We made a film that was really hard to finance.
[3:48:27.140 --> 3:48:29.140]  You know, most of our films are a lot easier to finance.
[3:48:29.140 --> 3:48:32.140]  No one wanted to put money into it, because at the end of the day, you know,
[3:48:32.140 --> 3:48:35.140]  at the time everyone was like, who wants to make a film about torture?
[3:48:35.140 --> 3:48:38.140]  And that was such a sweet vindication.
[3:48:38.140 --> 3:48:42.140]  And also, of all the films nominated, all the feature documentaries nominated this year,
[3:48:42.140 --> 3:48:44.140]  ours was by far the darkest.
[3:48:44.140 --> 3:48:50.140]  So it was a real nod from members of the Academy, you know, our filmmaking peers,
[3:48:50.140 --> 3:48:54.140]  and the industry, that such a dark, challenging film.
[3:48:54.140 --> 3:48:56.140]  Let me elaborate on that.
[3:48:56.140 --> 3:48:59.140]  I mean, people criticize me saying I'm being negative.
[3:48:59.140 --> 3:49:02.140]  No, ignoring these bad things is what is negative.
[3:49:02.140 --> 3:49:07.140]  Lancing the wound, you know, treating it, admitting these bad things are going on.
[3:49:07.140 --> 3:49:10.140]  Also gets our name back to a certain extent.
[3:49:10.140 --> 3:49:14.140]  I mean, I know some of your filmmakers are American, others are from other countries,
[3:49:14.140 --> 3:49:17.140]  but we appreciate it, you know, the fact that this can be exposed,
[3:49:17.140 --> 3:49:19.140]  so it doesn't continue to happen.
[3:49:19.140 --> 3:49:23.140]  And so how dare those, I saw some criticism of this is negative and anti-American.
[3:49:23.140 --> 3:49:26.140]  No, it's not. Torturing innocent people is un-American.
[3:49:26.140 --> 3:49:28.140]  Exactly, exactly.
[3:49:28.140 --> 3:49:32.140]  You know, the great thing about the film, too, is it's going to screen on HBO,
[3:49:32.140 --> 3:49:37.140]  Uncut in September, just before the elections, which is really, I think, going to be fantastic,
[3:49:37.140 --> 3:49:39.140]  and I think it'll get a lot of exposure.
[3:49:39.140 --> 3:49:41.140]  So that's really exciting.
[3:49:41.140 --> 3:49:44.140]  And, you know, the other thing that was, we made it, gosh, we finished it about a,
[3:49:44.140 --> 3:49:48.140]  well over a year ago, so, you know, we started making it like three years ago,
[3:49:48.140 --> 3:49:53.140]  and one of my concerns at the time, which is now is so bittersweetly funny,
[3:49:53.140 --> 3:49:56.140]  but, you know, one of my concerns was, God, what if this is just incredibly irrelevant
[3:49:56.140 --> 3:49:58.140]  by the time it comes out? What if it's all over?
[3:49:58.140 --> 3:50:00.140]  What if Guantanamo is closed?
[3:50:00.140 --> 3:50:03.140]  What if, you know, what if this isn't a discussion anymore?
[3:50:03.140 --> 3:50:06.140]  And it's just this morning, I was driving to an appointment,
[3:50:06.140 --> 3:50:11.140]  and I was listening to NPR and Jane Mayer, who was one of our, a huge help in the film.
[3:50:11.140 --> 3:50:15.140]  She's a New Yorker journalist who broke a lot of stories about torture.
[3:50:15.140 --> 3:50:19.140]  Over the last couple of years, she's just put a book out that's called The Dark Side,
[3:50:19.140 --> 3:50:24.140]  and it's, you know, it's really, you know, along the same lines as our film.
[3:50:24.140 --> 3:50:27.140]  Exactly. Now we have the Red Cross coming out and seeing war crimes.
[3:50:27.140 --> 3:50:31.140]  Now the gauntlet's down to the establishment,
[3:50:31.140 --> 3:50:34.140]  not the American Red Cross, international Red Cross folks, different folks,
[3:50:34.140 --> 3:50:37.140]  saying, you did this, you need to be punished.
[3:50:37.140 --> 3:50:40.140]  Final segment with Eva Orner, straight ahead.
[3:50:40.140 --> 3:50:42.140]  She is an Academy Award winner for Taxi the Dark Side.
[3:50:42.140 --> 3:50:44.140]  We'll talk about that film when we get back.
[3:50:48.140 --> 3:50:52.140]  Imagine walking down the street and hearing footsteps behind you.
[3:50:52.140 --> 3:50:56.140]  They get closer and closer, and suddenly you have a sense something bad is going to happen.
[3:50:56.140 --> 3:50:59.140]  What are you going to do to defend yourself?

[3:53:45.140 --> 3:53:53.140]  Oscar winner, Eva Orner, slams US government as war criminals.
[3:53:53.140 --> 3:53:56.140]  Harold's son, all over these big newspapers.
[3:53:56.140 --> 3:54:01.140]  She's bold, she's got a lot of courage, and I just am honored to even know her.
[3:54:01.140 --> 3:54:04.140]  She's a very sweet lady too.
[3:54:04.140 --> 3:54:09.140]  I've been interviewed by a couple of mainstream TV networks, Discovery Channel, History Channel.
[3:54:09.140 --> 3:54:15.140]  History and somebody else, they've been real mean to us, so she called up and said,
[3:54:15.140 --> 3:54:17.140]  where would Discovery Channel do it?
[3:54:17.140 --> 3:54:19.140]  And I was yelling at her, mainly.
[3:54:19.140 --> 3:54:22.140]  She still turned the other cheek and they turned out to be great folks.
[3:54:22.140 --> 3:54:29.140]  But making so many big films, Gonzo is the one in theaters across the country right now.
[3:54:29.140 --> 3:54:30.140]  You'll want to go see that.
[3:54:30.140 --> 3:54:36.140]  And she was just telling me during the break that tax of the dark side is going to be screening on HBO in the next few months.
[3:54:36.140 --> 3:54:39.140]  She'll give us the exact date in a moment. You want to see this.
[3:54:39.140 --> 3:54:41.140]  It's very disturbing though.
[3:54:41.140 --> 3:54:44.140]  I mean, you want to see her torturing her death, you'll get a chance.
[3:54:44.140 --> 3:54:47.140]  Young men, young kids, totally innocent.
[3:54:47.140 --> 3:54:49.140]  The sickos, they had doing it.
[3:54:49.140 --> 3:54:51.140]  The orders to do it.
[3:54:51.140 --> 3:54:54.140]  And then it's going to be on DVD, and I'm going to get ahold of these.
[3:54:54.140 --> 3:54:57.140]  I'm going to have these on the website, but they'll be in stores as well.
[3:54:57.140 --> 3:54:58.140]  You need to show this to everybody.
[3:54:58.140 --> 3:55:02.140]  Eva Orner, do you have the exact date of when it's going to be screening on HBO?
[3:55:02.140 --> 3:55:07.140]  I actually don't, but it's going to be definitely September and they're going to be screening at Uncut.
[3:55:07.140 --> 3:55:10.140]  And there'll be a lot of publicity surrounding it.
[3:55:10.140 --> 3:55:14.140]  And then after it screens on HBO, it'll be widely available on DVD.
[3:55:14.140 --> 3:55:17.140]  By Uncut, is that more hardcore than the theater?
[3:55:17.140 --> 3:55:18.140]  No, it's the theater cut.
[3:55:18.140 --> 3:55:23.140]  But I think a lot of networks, the reason we love that HBO is showing it is because they're going to show at Uncut.
[3:55:23.140 --> 3:55:25.140]  And it's definitely challenging.
[3:55:25.140 --> 3:55:27.140]  And there are definitely really disturbing scenes in it.
[3:55:27.140 --> 3:55:29.140]  You've got some video and photos.
[3:55:29.140 --> 3:55:32.140]  You've got some video and photos that were never put on the news, folks.
[3:55:32.140 --> 3:55:34.140]  Some of this is triple X.
[3:55:34.140 --> 3:55:36.140]  And we don't mean that in a good way.
[3:55:36.140 --> 3:55:39.140]  We had amazing access, you know, and incredible researchers.
[3:55:39.140 --> 3:55:42.140]  And we got a lot of footage that nobody's seen before.
[3:55:42.140 --> 3:55:46.140]  So there's definitely a disturbing and thought-provoking film.
[3:55:46.140 --> 3:55:47.140]  Yeah, folks.
[3:55:47.140 --> 3:55:49.140]  You'll actually be inside the torture pits.
[3:55:49.140 --> 3:55:51.140]  Not the sanitized stuff you saw in the news.
[3:55:51.140 --> 3:55:55.140]  And no, that's horrible to say, but you think it's cute seeing movies like Hostel and stuff.
[3:55:55.140 --> 3:55:56.140]  It's not cute.
[3:55:56.140 --> 3:55:57.140]  It's not funny.
[3:55:57.140 --> 3:55:59.140]  You need to see Tax of the Dark Side.
[3:55:59.140 --> 3:56:03.140]  In closing, you've had a lot of courage.
[3:56:03.140 --> 3:56:06.140]  I mean, is it fulfilling to know you're really doing good in the world, Eva?
[3:56:06.140 --> 3:56:09.140]  You know, it's really good at a time like this.
[3:56:09.140 --> 3:56:13.140]  And the world doesn't feel like the greatest place in my lifetime anyway.
[3:56:13.140 --> 3:56:19.140]  It feels good to be making stuff that is thought-provoking and challenging and provocative and makes a difference.
[3:56:19.140 --> 3:56:21.140]  You know, in some small way.
[3:56:21.140 --> 3:56:23.140]  Yeah, it's really inspiring.
[3:56:23.140 --> 3:56:26.140]  And that's the sort of stuff that I hope to continue to do.
[3:56:26.140 --> 3:56:27.140]  But it's not a small way.
[3:56:27.140 --> 3:56:29.140]  I mean, they wouldn't fund you.
[3:56:29.140 --> 3:56:30.140]  People told you don't make it.
[3:56:30.140 --> 3:56:31.140]  You did it.
[3:56:31.140 --> 3:56:32.140]  You won the Oscar.
[3:56:32.140 --> 3:56:35.140]  And now you're catapulting with another huge film.
[3:56:35.140 --> 3:56:37.140]  I just love the success story, even.
[3:56:37.140 --> 3:56:45.140]  I love watching it from afar, your success, because that's what floats my boat in life, is seeing other people succeed through adversity.
[3:56:45.140 --> 3:56:47.140]  And there's nothing more beautiful.
[3:56:47.140 --> 3:56:52.140]  We're going to get your director of Tax of the Dark Side and Gonzo on, because that can also interview him about his Enron film,
[3:56:52.140 --> 3:56:57.140]  the smartest guys in the room, and that's going to be interesting as well.
[3:56:57.140 --> 3:57:01.140]  Give out some of the websites for your film company or any other info.
[3:57:01.140 --> 3:57:10.140]  The website for the Alex Givney's company is jigsawprud.com.
[3:57:10.140 --> 3:57:18.140]  And there's the website for the Hunter S. Thompson movie, which is, I believe, Hunter Thompson movie.com,
[3:57:18.140 --> 3:57:22.140]  where you can see the trailer and read all about it and read the press kit.
[3:57:22.140 --> 3:57:27.140]  But if you just Google Hunter S. Thompson film, you'll find a lot of information as well.
[3:57:27.140 --> 3:57:30.140]  The trailer's everywhere, and there's lots and lots of reviews.
[3:57:30.140 --> 3:57:33.140]  And also saying we're taxi to the dark side.
[3:57:33.140 --> 3:57:38.140]  Just Google it, and you'll find lots of interesting information.
[3:57:38.140 --> 3:57:42.140]  And by the way, Johnny Depp is narrating the new Gonzo film.
[3:57:42.140 --> 3:57:43.140]  Yeah, and he's in it as well.
[3:57:43.140 --> 3:57:45.140]  He's interviewed as well.
[3:57:45.140 --> 3:57:46.140]  He's pretty terrific.
[3:57:46.140 --> 3:57:47.140]  Yeah, neat guy.
[3:57:47.140 --> 3:57:50.140]  Okay, thank you so much for spending time with us, Eva.

[3:57:52.140 --> 3:57:53.140]  You bet.

[3:57:58.140 --> 3:58:01.140]  We are out of here, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:58:01.140 --> 3:58:06.140]  Speaking of my film, which has no voice over from Alex Jones, and is amazing,
[3:58:06.140 --> 3:58:09.140]  and shows you who the truth movement is, how 9-Eleven's an inside job,
[3:58:09.140 --> 3:58:11.140]  how the first responders aren't getting treatment,
[3:58:11.140 --> 3:58:12.140]  it is truth rising.
[3:58:12.140 --> 3:58:14.140]  It needs to be seen.

[3:58:36.140 --> 3:58:41.140]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops,
[3:58:41.140 --> 3:58:45.140]  I went to Ground Zero and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[3:58:45.140 --> 3:58:52.140]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-Eleven film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[3:58:52.140 --> 3:59:01.140]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[3:59:01.140 --> 3:59:06.140]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-Eleven truth as brave souls throughout the world
[3:59:06.140 --> 3:59:08.140]  take action against their global masters.
[3:59:08.140 --> 3:59:11.140]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[3:59:11.140 --> 3:59:17.140]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[3:59:17.140 --> 3:59:20.140]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[3:59:29.140 --> 3:59:31.140]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror,
[3:59:31.140 --> 3:59:38.140]  they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[3:59:46.140 --> 3:59:48.140]  Eugenics dominated the 20th century.
[3:59:48.140 --> 4:00:02.140]  It's Ruthless Spirit.
