[00:00.000 --> 00:12.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.160 --> 00:20.880]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.880 --> 00:29.520]  welcome everyone it is Friday June 1st 2012 and we are in the midst of
[00:29.520 --> 00:35.400]  expo exposing the cockroach globalists out in Bilderberg Chantilly it is
[00:35.400 --> 00:40.120]  Bilderberg 2012 Chantilly 3.0 this is the first the third time they've been there
[00:40.120 --> 00:43.880]  and we are exposing them this is going to be the biggest protest yet if you're
[00:43.880 --> 00:48.560]  listening to my voice and you live within 200 miles of Chantilly you can be
[00:48.560 --> 00:54.600]  there in three hours three hours and you could be part of the global exposing
[00:54.600 --> 00:58.560]  you could do it right now there's tons of activists there from all over the
[00:58.560 --> 01:03.320]  country Alex Jones with his crew is there Aaron Dykes Rob Jacobson Richard
[01:03.320 --> 01:10.520]  Reeves there's Adam Kokesh RT is also there we are change from all over
[01:10.520 --> 01:15.800]  there's we are change chapters from all over Occupy Portland is there activists
[01:15.800 --> 01:21.160]  from all over the country are descending upon Chantilly Virginia and you could be
[01:21.160 --> 01:24.880]  a part of it you can get in your car right now and head over there and be a
[01:24.880 --> 01:28.480]  part of it because today is going to be the big day they're having a protest I
[01:28.480 --> 01:33.680]  believe at 6 p.m. they want to surround the entire grounds and when they need a
[01:33.680 --> 01:39.120]  lot of people to do it so get over there we've got some big news this is coming
[01:39.120 --> 01:43.480]  from one of Jim Tucker's sources and we're gonna play this video later Alex
[01:43.480 --> 01:47.200]  is gonna introduce it and play it insider and this is on info wars right now
[01:47.200 --> 01:51.320]  Bilderberg members share Ron Paul Deathwish and this is from Paul Joseph
[01:51.320 --> 01:55.360]  Watson during a heated conversation in the lobby at the Westfields Marriott
[01:55.360 --> 01:59.280]  yesterday Bilderberg members expressed their desire to see Ron Paul die in a
[01:59.280 --> 02:04.840]  plane crash according to veteran journalist Jim Tucker's inside source so
[02:04.840 --> 02:09.480]  you can go we have a video about that as well on the Alex Jones channel and you
[02:09.480 --> 02:13.880]  could check that out the shocking exchange took place just after Bilderberg
[02:13.880 --> 02:16.680]  attendees started arriving yesterday morning as they were driven through
[02:16.680 --> 02:21.240]  crowds of hundreds of Paul supporting demonstrators wasting no time to shot
[02:21.240 --> 02:25.320]  their mouths off one Bilderberg member expressed his desire to get Ron Paul and
[02:25.320 --> 02:29.400]  all of his supporters on an airplane with a Muslim suicide pilot and take them
[02:29.400 --> 02:33.640]  down well I think you're gonna have a problem because there's a lot more than
[02:33.640 --> 02:37.520]  one plane full of Ron Paul supporters and if you did that it would energize the
[02:37.520 --> 02:41.440]  movement to a degree that you couldn't even imagine just like when they struck
[02:41.440 --> 02:45.880]  down Obi-Wan Kenobi he became more powerful Tucker explained that the
[02:45.880 --> 02:50.040]  Bilderbergers are increasingly irate at the resistance among patriotic
[02:50.040 --> 02:56.000]  Americans to their program with protest figures rising at each annual confab and
[02:56.000 --> 03:00.240]  here's a quote the program plan by Bilderberg has been set back for years
[03:00.240 --> 03:03.320]  and every year it gets worse and every year they get more depressed and every
[03:03.320 --> 03:07.640]  year they get more outraged we're winning they are losing last night we
[03:07.640 --> 03:13.040]  showed a picture of a young I guess David Rockefeller if y'all could find
[03:13.040 --> 03:17.840]  that from last night and throw that up we caught him the face of Bilderberg the
[03:17.840 --> 03:24.440]  uncle of death David Rockefeller I mean the man looks like he has red blood
[03:24.440 --> 03:28.560]  pouring out of his eyes he's so old and decrepit and now he is shambling through
[03:28.560 --> 03:33.840]  the halls of the Westfields Marriott in Chantilly and you could be there you can
[03:33.840 --> 03:37.200]  get in a car right now and head up there we're gonna be back and we're gonna
[03:37.200 --> 03:41.360]  have a whole bunch more stuff coming up today we've got some videos we're gonna
[03:41.360 --> 03:47.560]  show you if we are change confronting Rothschild and Ted Turner I want to go
[03:47.560 --> 03:52.080]  into this yesterday when Alex arrived on scene there was an attempt of ambush
[03:52.080 --> 03:56.640]  journalism by some Tucker Carlson cronies they stuck a mic up in Alex's face
[03:56.640 --> 03:59.680]  and they said how much money are you making off all this like that was the
[03:59.680 --> 04:05.760]  big deal that was the most important thing that Alex Jones is a successful
[04:05.760 --> 04:09.000]  businessman that's what he is and that's what America is all about it's all
[04:09.000 --> 04:12.920]  about hard work Alex Jones works harder than probably a hundred percent of this

[08:06.120 --> 08:22.360]  there's a war on for your mind
[08:22.360 --> 08:28.960]  good morning good afternoon wherever you may be in this world we are confronting
[08:28.960 --> 08:36.200]  Bilderberg and Chantilly Virginia it is Bilderberg 2012 the biggest protest yet is
[08:36.200 --> 08:41.880]  going on right now and this is you're watching live video of Alex Jones he was
[08:41.880 --> 08:46.880]  just bullhorning the Bilderbergers behind there they're hiding behind a fence and
[08:46.880 --> 08:51.400]  now they've erected black in front of that fence so you can't see in at all
[08:51.400 --> 08:56.480]  it's at least eight feet high and there's cops driving by looks like cops are
[08:56.480 --> 09:02.640]  giving people tickets now I talked Alex this morning and he said that cops were
[09:02.640 --> 09:06.040]  ticketing people just for stopping and letting people out and looks like that's
[09:06.040 --> 09:10.360]  happening now so we're getting video of that this is totally ridiculous the
[09:10.360 --> 09:13.200]  cops obviously don't understand that their pension funds are going to be
[09:13.200 --> 09:17.080]  raided that their children are being subjected to poisons via fluoride in the
[09:17.080 --> 09:21.120]  water via the vaccines via the chemtrails they don't realize they're
[09:21.120 --> 09:25.880]  protecting the people who are in charge of this right now by going along with
[09:25.880 --> 09:29.240]  these ridiculous orders these are not orders that they have to follow these
[09:29.240 --> 09:32.680]  are orders where they could actually stand down and not ticket people and not
[09:32.680 --> 09:37.760]  waste taxpayers time and expense and if I was someone who got a ticket and did
[09:37.760 --> 09:43.120]  not live in Virginia I wouldn't pay it I would keep it I would let them send all
[09:43.120 --> 09:47.680]  the little mail they want to send me keep that expense going keep it keep it
[09:47.680 --> 09:52.160]  happening I wouldn't pay it at all because it's unjust and it's ridiculous
[09:52.160 --> 09:55.880]  and they're stopping people in parking lots that says the parking lot says
[09:55.880 --> 10:00.080]  private property the cops are pulling in you have to have the property owner
[10:00.080 --> 10:05.160]  specifically on each account say this person is trespassing you can't just
[10:05.160 --> 10:11.000]  have a blanket no trespassing set up unless you put no trespassing signs if
[10:11.000 --> 10:16.400]  you if it's if it says a private property you could park your car there and
[10:16.400 --> 10:20.120]  only the property owner can have it towed the cop can't just say hey we're
[10:20.120 --> 10:24.280]  gonna have this towed unless they have expressed permission from the property
[10:24.280 --> 10:28.400]  owner so that's all going on now Alex Jones was bullhorning a second ago
[10:28.400 --> 10:32.600]  during the commercial break he's right now he's holding up something we've got
[10:32.600 --> 10:37.040]  two streams going at once right now we're really taking the technology to
[10:37.040 --> 10:41.520]  the next level you can go to our featured stories page and we have
[10:41.520 --> 10:46.840]  Bilderberg live video and Bilderberg breaking news and you can check both of
[10:46.840 --> 10:51.840]  those out for all the latest stuff that we're posting that other activists are
[10:51.840 --> 10:55.440]  posting I know pretty soon we're gonna have a photo page coming up that we're
[10:55.440 --> 10:59.680]  working on right now and as soon as that gets posted I will let you know it's
[10:59.680 --> 11:03.880]  gonna have posts of our photos of the people who were coming in yesterday who
[11:03.880 --> 11:08.000]  have been identified who have been identified as Bilderbergers in fact
[11:08.000 --> 11:12.400]  there's one right now they're showing into the camera are we getting any
[11:12.400 --> 11:16.720]  audio there at all could we listen to any of that look all right we're gonna pull
[11:16.720 --> 11:33.880]  that up for a second listen to what they're talking about okay it doesn't
[11:33.880 --> 11:38.880]  seem like they're they're saying much Alex Jones is gathering intel there's a
[11:38.880 --> 11:42.560]  lot of great activists out there it's all Dan Dix out there Jason Bermas
[11:42.560 --> 11:48.040]  Luke Radowski Adam Kokash Matt Medina all over the United States and all over
[11:48.040 --> 11:51.520]  Canada people are descending upon Chantilly so if you are sitting in your
[11:51.520 --> 11:55.640]  couch right now if you were at work even plan on getting off early tell tell the
[11:55.640 --> 12:00.440]  boss you got a case of the Bilderbergers and you got to step out get to Chantilly
[12:00.440 --> 12:05.120]  be part of this movement we are the people's media and we have to expose
[12:05.120 --> 12:09.320]  these people because if we don't do it no one else is gonna do it you know the
[12:09.320 --> 12:12.840]  Washington Times barely posted something about it yesterday the Washington
[12:12.840 --> 12:17.800]  Post didn't post anything they were more concerned about W showing up at the
[12:17.800 --> 12:23.120]  White House and I figured out why because Donald E. Graham chairman and CEO the
[12:23.120 --> 12:27.640]  Washington Post company is on the list of attendees that was released yesterday
[12:27.640 --> 12:33.240]  on info boards.com that also made drudge they put the official list out as
[12:33.240 --> 12:38.960]  well there's a whole bunch of names on there Gary Kasparov the chess player
[12:38.960 --> 12:44.240]  this guy could could be in line to unseat Putin because he's Putin seems to
[12:44.240 --> 12:49.360]  be one of the few like him or not that is going against the global regime he's
[12:49.360 --> 12:54.000]  got his own little mafia and he wants to be king so we're definitely gonna see
[12:54.000 --> 12:59.800]  stuff going in that way what's going on with them right now it says you have
[12:59.800 --> 13:08.640]  video your life just let us know when you want to throw to audio I've been
[13:08.640 --> 13:12.640]  wanting to go audio the whole time guys I mean that's my whole point is that's
[13:12.640 --> 13:16.960]  what we do I'm gonna try this on air you guys can just throw to us on the street
[13:16.960 --> 13:21.200]  whenever you want you just throw to us to the street whenever you want like what
[13:21.200 --> 13:25.760]  something interesting is happening you just throw it to us on air I mean it's
[13:25.760 --> 13:29.320]  like hundreds of times I've said that it's like it's I don't know what else I
[13:29.320 --> 13:37.360]  can do I guess we'll just do it with you stream ourselves just forget the radio
[13:37.360 --> 13:41.680]  show I mean it doesn't exist thanks for doing it yeah Roku channel is awesome
[13:41.680 --> 13:45.600]  actually I watch it on my big screen TV every day you're live in my living room
[13:45.600 --> 13:55.200]  it's a little strange but you know let's just stop streaming okay they've cut
[13:55.200 --> 13:58.120]  it looks like they cut one of the streams right now we're gonna be back
[13:58.120 --> 14:04.960]  with them as soon as they go live we're having a couple technical issues we we're
[14:04.960 --> 14:09.600]  trying to communicate with them via cell phone text via we also have a two-way
[14:09.600 --> 14:13.560]  signal that's running back to them when they have the headphones on which I don't
[14:13.560 --> 14:17.440]  know if anybody is wearing the headphones but we will be back with more of that
[14:17.440 --> 14:22.360]  coverage of Bilderberg live I'm gonna go in through a couple articles now this is
[14:22.360 --> 14:28.160]  out of the BBC Venezuela bans a private gun ownership Venezuela has brought a
[14:28.160 --> 14:31.600]  new gun law into effect which bans commercial sale of firearms and
[14:31.600 --> 14:36.080]  ammunition until now anyone with a gun permit could buy firearms from a
[14:36.080 --> 14:39.840]  private company under the new law only army police and certain groups like
[14:39.840 --> 14:45.360]  security companies you could scratch out security companies and put thugs will be
[14:45.360 --> 14:48.800]  able to buy arms from the state-owned weapons manufacturer and import it
[14:48.800 --> 14:53.080]  importer this ban is the latest attempt by the government to improve security and
[14:53.080 --> 14:55.320]  cut crime ahead of elections in October
[14:55.320 --> 15:00.120]  Venezuela saw more than 1,800 murders last year and the capital Caracas is
[15:00.120 --> 15:03.640]  thought to be one of the most dangerous cities in Latin America that's because
[15:03.640 --> 15:08.320]  they ban handguns because only criminals will then have handguns they
[15:08.320 --> 15:11.000]  obviously haven't learned and they obviously don't have a second
[15:11.000 --> 15:15.440]  amendment and the government has been running a gun amnesty in the run-up to
[15:15.440 --> 15:17.800]  the introduction of the new law to encourage people to give up their
[15:17.800 --> 15:21.600]  illegal arms without fear of consequence yeah you you're definitely not
[15:21.600 --> 15:26.040]  going to get put on a list for that one member of the public in Caracas till BBC
[15:26.040 --> 15:29.320]  they're killing people every day the law is important but they need to do more
[15:29.320 --> 15:33.280]  they're not doing enough now so that's the problem the people in Caracas have
[15:33.280 --> 15:39.520]  been domesticated they are not fans of private gun ownership and they're not
[15:39.520 --> 15:42.840]  exercising that right they have to defend themselves that's a God-given
[15:42.840 --> 15:47.400]  right you have the right to defend yourself and if guns are what's available
[15:47.400 --> 15:50.520]  then that's what you should have back when they had swords they made it
[15:50.520 --> 15:56.760]  illegal to carry swords for the peasants to carry swords and now it's guns so
[15:56.760 --> 15:59.600]  they're gonna they're gonna keep ratcheting up these laws and ratcheting
[15:59.600 --> 16:02.600]  up these laws because they want to do away with guns they only want police and
[16:02.600 --> 16:05.920]  army to have guns because then they can do whatever they want then they can run
[16:05.920 --> 16:10.520]  in trample people down spray the whole area with machine gun fire and nobody
[16:10.520 --> 16:14.840]  can defend themselves and that's the way the governments of this world like it
[16:14.840 --> 16:19.120]  they like it to be that way several Latin American countries have murder rates
[16:19.120 --> 16:24.280]  far higher than the global average of 6.9 murders per 100,000 people according
[16:24.280 --> 16:27.480]  to a recent United Nations report South America Central America and the Caribbean
[16:27.480 --> 16:33.080]  have the highest rates of murder by firearms in the world interesting it
[16:33.080 --> 16:36.960]  is found over 70% of all homicides in South America are as a result of guns
[16:36.960 --> 16:42.480]  in Western Europe the figure was closer to 25% one there you go when you ban
[16:42.480 --> 16:47.080]  private gun ownership you're gonna have more crime with more guns because guns
[16:47.080 --> 16:52.040]  come in there illegally in fact our own government is part of shipping guns in
[16:52.040 --> 16:57.640]  to at least Mexico and we have them shipping them container fulls of guns
[16:57.640 --> 17:02.200]  to Honduras we have reports of that out of Tampa so our government is complicit
[17:02.200 --> 17:05.800]  in sending guns across the border to these countries and you know they're not
[17:05.800 --> 17:10.160]  going to private property owners or regular citizens they're going to
[17:10.160 --> 17:14.160]  criminals they're going to drug dealers they're going to anybody who is out
[17:14.160 --> 17:17.720]  there trying to destabilize governments to create chaos because when they create
[17:17.720 --> 17:21.320]  chaos they can come in with the control that's the way it works it doesn't work
[17:21.320 --> 17:26.440]  any other way there's and that's why they do that here's another one yesterday
[17:26.440 --> 17:33.280]  we covered some some information out of of Spain and now we have Treasury
[17:33.280 --> 17:37.400]  secretary Tim Geithner told Spain that a solution is needed for the trouble
[17:37.400 --> 17:41.240]  financial system and you know they're going to talk about more bailouts for
[17:41.240 --> 17:43.920]  the banks because those are the ones that are in trouble it's the banks that
[17:43.920 --> 17:48.040]  are in trouble and the banks are the root of this cause across Europe we've
[17:48.040 --> 17:54.440]  already seen we've already seen Greece go under and now it's Spain next we know
[17:54.440 --> 17:59.360]  Portugal's on the list and from then it's the rest of Europe probably a few
[17:59.360 --> 18:02.800]  countries in Eastern Europe a few countries in Western Europe I predict
[18:02.800 --> 18:06.640]  Germany or Great Britain are probably going to be the last to fall because
[18:06.640 --> 18:11.080]  they at least they have larger more stable economies definitely Germany's got
[18:11.080 --> 18:14.800]  more of a stable economy but eventually this crisis is going to catch up to
[18:14.800 --> 18:19.000]  everyone and then it's going to hit the United States and the Asian countries
[18:19.000 --> 18:23.200]  will be the ones last standing and then they will come in and raid us like
[18:23.200 --> 18:27.240]  vultures like you've never seen before I remember in the 90s they were the
[18:27.240 --> 18:30.160]  Japanese were buying up ballparks and we thought that was the end of the world
[18:30.160 --> 18:34.480]  and it's not it's going to get a lot worse you think they're going to own
[18:34.480 --> 18:39.240]  everything but it won't it won't even be the Asians owning this it'll be the
[18:39.240 --> 18:44.120]  giant New World Order global syndicate that we are now protesting in Chantilly
[18:44.120 --> 18:48.440]  Virginia right now as we speak that if you put that graphic up it's got the
[18:48.440 --> 18:52.600]  Westfields Marriott address you could show up there now you could start
[18:52.600 --> 18:56.840]  protesting you could be part of this you can be part of the people's media bring
[18:56.840 --> 19:01.040]  your cell phones take video because these roaches one thing they don't like
[19:01.040 --> 19:06.200]  are video cameras and they don't like the light being shine on them we have
[19:06.200 --> 19:13.040]  another story here let's see video shows activists arrested at Bilderberg and
[19:13.040 --> 19:16.880]  video from we are changed those two activists being arrested by Fairfax
[19:16.880 --> 19:20.560]  police for taking close-up photos of Bilderberg members arriving in Chantilly
[19:20.560 --> 19:24.000]  Virginia another example of how the security crag now surrounding this
[19:24.000 --> 19:28.480]  year's conference is more intense than ever before one of the activists arrested
[19:28.480 --> 19:34.080]  is a veteran because they hate veterans and we're gonna be going to break I've

[24:50.400 --> 24:53.560]  now in the middle of the day I would guess them will probably have a thousand
[24:53.560 --> 24:58.400]  by tomorrow the police have engaged in egregious activities that we're gonna be
[24:58.400 --> 25:03.720]  breaking down the next segment but here is our top story last night I got in at
[25:03.720 --> 25:08.800]  1130 and Jim Tucker was going to bed he was too tired to talk but he told me
[25:08.800 --> 25:13.600]  yes the Bilderberg group is hopping mad at Ron Paul and Paul Watson's written
[25:13.600 --> 25:17.440]  an article about this that's at info wars dot com Bilderberg group once Ron
[25:17.440 --> 25:22.760]  Paul dead that's a source and again Tucker has people inside the hotel so do
[25:22.760 --> 25:27.280]  we that's how we knew well the code name and so many other issues I'll just leave
[25:27.280 --> 25:31.800]  it at that but we also have sources within Bilderberg show I'm just turning
[25:31.800 --> 25:36.320]  out of the wind here folks show continuing with this information people the
[25:36.320 --> 25:39.680]  average layman's like why would they be shooting their mouth about Ron Paul the
[25:39.680 --> 25:46.200]  police are pulling over everyone that has a Ron Paul sticker on their car and
[25:46.200 --> 25:49.880]  searching it and harassing them and going after it I've talked to countless
[25:49.880 --> 25:53.560]  people I've seen literally 50 tickets or more everybody show me the tickets
[25:53.560 --> 25:56.800]  they're getting if you pull over in a parking lot to drop people off they're
[25:56.800 --> 26:00.160]  hitting you it's not even the law everybody's got to fight these tickets
[26:00.160 --> 26:05.440]  if you people dropping off handicapped people in parking lanes are they're
[26:05.440 --> 26:08.960]  going after them again I'm gonna be breaking all that down but the point is
[26:08.960 --> 26:13.720]  imagine they come through yesterday 200 people with bull horns myself included
[26:13.720 --> 26:18.360]  screaming new world order you're going down scum Treasury officials Federal
[26:18.360 --> 26:21.400]  Reserve people the Queen of the Netherlands Henry Kissinger David
[26:21.400 --> 26:25.120]  Rockefeller Barnaby a Rothschild all of them are going in there and they're
[26:25.120 --> 26:28.480]  and they understand Ron Paul they know Ron Paul was the real winner in the
[26:28.480 --> 26:31.600]  first Republican primaries they understand so when they get out some of
[26:31.600 --> 26:36.560]  them are screaming in anger and going I will get that Ron Paul it's mainly
[26:36.560 --> 26:40.680]  Europeans and saying I want to put them on the plane with all of their
[26:40.680 --> 26:46.400]  supporters and then have a Muslim blow it up and I mean that is like his he
[26:46.400 --> 26:49.680]  fits when these arrogant people that command all these you know tens of
[26:49.680 --> 26:53.040]  thousands of employees and minions and governments with all these yes men
[26:53.040 --> 26:57.040]  groveling to them to drive through and be bullhorned at point blank range
[26:57.040 --> 27:03.640]  upsets them there goes Jim Tucker and so what they do is they then freak out and
[27:03.640 --> 27:08.400]  begin demonizing Ron Paul and so that's why they're doing this and we've
[27:08.400 --> 27:12.520]  confirmed that they are flipping out on Ron Paul from our source that's inside
[27:12.520 --> 27:18.160]  now our source didn't hear the part about wanting to kill us but Tucker's
[27:18.160 --> 27:22.120]  source did hear that so there are conniption fits against Ron Paul and
[27:22.120 --> 27:26.160]  we've been told that in those six oh seven oh eight oh nine oh ten eleven right
[27:26.160 --> 27:32.280]  up to this year they they say we've got a bankrupt the economy faster that's a
[27:32.280 --> 27:35.480]  talking point when they're debating do we totally implode it and they wake up
[27:35.480 --> 27:39.320]  or do we go slow they say look they shouldn't have money to be protesting us
[27:39.320 --> 27:43.240]  they shouldn't be up here in the high Alps in a luxury area able to get here
[27:43.240 --> 27:45.920]  even though a lot of people are sleeping in their cars saving up money to come
[27:45.920 --> 27:49.360]  here and they get here and here are the police doing this and here is the
[27:49.360 --> 27:52.200]  Bilderberg group we're come back from break and play that clip here is the
[27:52.200 --> 27:56.360]  Bilderberg group with the nerve to have the police working for them the police
[27:56.360 --> 28:00.600]  smiling with glee as they write old ladies and families with their kids
[28:00.600 --> 28:04.640]  tickets as they search cars without warrants as these little kids look up
[28:04.640 --> 28:08.040]  scared at the police while a bunch of crooks violate and break the Logan act
[28:08.040 --> 28:11.360]  and they get out of their cars arrogantly and are you know it's like
[28:11.360 --> 28:14.280]  something out of you know Schwarzenegger when he gets all mad reportedly
[28:14.280 --> 28:19.240]  just getting so upset and saying no no because that's what it's described as
[28:19.240 --> 28:23.080]  as these European Bilderbergs in English looking at all the police and
[28:23.080 --> 28:27.360]  everybody and throwing big fits and saying nah because they tell the members
[28:27.360 --> 28:30.840]  do not look them in the eyes don't look any of them Hillary in the eyes if you
[28:30.840 --> 28:33.840]  look them in the eyes you're fired these are people you can't look them in the
[28:33.840 --> 28:38.720]  eyes and the police literally kneel before them and say what is thy bidding
[28:38.720 --> 28:42.880]  and they're like run your scum brother in Americans out of the way dominate
[28:42.880 --> 28:47.480]  them lick them learn they have no rights launch drone attacks launch TSA

[28:56.920 --> 29:01.040]  dollar fines give them tyranny drive them into submission blow up Ron Paul
[29:01.040 --> 29:05.040]  murder them use our fake Muslim extremists to take the blame and anything
[29:05.040 --> 29:08.040]  about Larry McDonald the congressman the Democrat who Ron Paul says is his real
[29:08.040 --> 29:15.560]  hero even more than people like Barry Goldwater they put him on a plane the
[29:15.560 --> 29:19.160]  other senators said we're not getting on out of Alaska and it disappeared into
[29:19.160 --> 29:24.240]  North Korea and boy the word is they they did some serious stuff to him and so
[29:24.240 --> 29:27.800]  they'd like to put Ron Paul on an airplane and understand that this will
[29:27.800 --> 29:31.680]  probably stop them but I'm telling you that means it's been discussed when Ron
[29:31.680 --> 29:35.480]  Paul gets on an airplane nerve-gassing the plane and saying al-Qaeda did it and
[29:35.480 --> 29:39.240]  using it to take our liberties we'll be right back on the other side of this

[37:24.000 --> 37:28.720]  sub sleep state look it up scientifically television and this is it
[37:28.720 --> 37:32.360]  these are all television heads believe all the cop shows on TV or real they're
[37:32.360 --> 37:35.880]  following a template program they're in a dream state I'm not joking when I say
[37:35.880 --> 37:40.080]  that all right now let's go back to Ron Paul people are saying just keep going
[37:40.080 --> 37:44.520]  it's good keep videotape of that while I talk again directing radio and TV here
[37:44.520 --> 37:46.920]  on the ground this is the future of the media we've been doing this on the
[37:46.920 --> 37:49.840]  ground for five years now the technology is finally caught to a point where it's
[37:49.840 --> 37:55.600]  amazing and a very powerful tool look at her looking in the car look at him
[37:55.600 --> 37:58.320]  giving the guy a ticket one of the demonstrators who dare drop people off
[37:58.320 --> 38:01.840]  making money off the citizens this is just too incredible if you're an XM
[38:01.840 --> 38:06.160]  listener on 166 or AM or FM keep listening you can also go to infowars.com
[38:06.160 --> 38:10.360]  for intermittent streams but only the radio will have complete coverage and
[38:10.360 --> 38:14.520]  continual coverage so they give the victim the ticket to pay to protect the
[38:14.520 --> 38:18.280]  criminals violating the Logan Act inside they have dealt with the American
[38:18.280 --> 38:22.360]  scum for the foreign bankers who have openly bankrupted this country and say
[38:22.360 --> 38:26.040]  the UN and NATO now run our military that is what you're witnessing another
[38:26.040 --> 38:30.080]  victory against America another victory against freedom and the funny part is
[38:30.080 --> 38:34.480]  I've got the Treasury Department report their pensions are already gone and
[38:34.480 --> 38:38.160]  they don't care because they love the tyranny and it's all gonna come back on
[38:38.160 --> 38:42.720]  them there they go and they're gonna just keep going bam bam bam bam pulling
[38:42.720 --> 38:47.200]  people over here okay continuing back to Ron Paul I saw the trolls immediately
[38:47.200 --> 38:51.360]  say why would they be threatening Ron Paul in the lobby because they 30 seconds
[38:51.360 --> 38:55.280]  before being bullhorned their murderers and criminals and globalists and
[38:55.280 --> 38:59.600]  corporate fascists setting up the New World Order they pull up they get out we
[38:59.600 --> 39:04.800]  have sources inside duh the lobby that'll really freak them out we do
[39:04.800 --> 39:07.600]  that's how we knew they were gonna do a fake bomb scared not from our lobby
[39:07.600 --> 39:11.120]  people but from somebody right inside security as they did last year in
[39:11.120 --> 39:14.240]  Switzerland we are blowing their operation they are scared that's why
[39:14.240 --> 39:17.240]  they're up in this that's why they're doing this they are in panic mode in
[39:17.240 --> 39:20.840]  there and pray for me by the way folks I'm definitely on their radar show is
[39:20.840 --> 39:25.960]  Ron Paul because we've definitely got their attention right now pray for us
[39:25.960 --> 39:30.360]  you know our God's bigger than a little devil and that's who I put my people
[39:30.360 --> 39:33.760]  keep asking where's your security where is it it's not here folks I'm here okay
[39:33.760 --> 39:38.320]  I am standing against tyranny I am not a coward and and and some people won't
[39:38.320 --> 39:40.800]  even come here even though they love liberty because they're scared folks
[39:40.800 --> 39:44.640]  you better be scared if you don't face them now here they are the enemy you
[39:44.640 --> 39:48.440]  know the New World Order has landed you know it's it's it's one of my land to
[39:48.440 --> 39:52.920]  it by sea there they are they're in there right now these are the people doing
[39:52.920 --> 39:56.640]  it these are the people that live off your tax money the robber barons now
[39:56.640 --> 40:00.720]  going back to Rob do here let me just explain this so imagine every year they
[40:00.720 --> 40:03.800]  freak out and say stuff like oh Ron Paul he's horrible he's waking up the youth
[40:03.800 --> 40:07.080]  man we got to do something about him there was a little discussion about it
[40:07.080 --> 40:12.440]  be nice to be died what was it in 08 we covered that this time they are
[40:12.440 --> 40:17.480]  stomping around and remember they're totally spoiled rotten brats okay who
[40:17.480 --> 40:21.000]  are royalty you name it just used to whatever they want Queen Beatrice's
[40:21.000 --> 40:24.360]  assistant is who we believed it was the big six-foot-three blonde or whatever
[40:24.360 --> 40:28.840]  screaming at people we have machine guns grabbing staff by the arm and going you
[40:28.840 --> 40:33.080]  will do as we say and tell no one they go what does that mean you will not just
[40:33.080 --> 40:37.600]  lose job machine gun it's more like a Russian accent but it's like oh machine
[40:37.600 --> 40:43.280]  gun well I I need to kneel to you oh you have a machine gun I I'm scared now
[40:43.280 --> 40:47.560]  I'm gonna do whatever you say I mean this is this is how ridiculous it is
[40:47.560 --> 40:51.560]  somebody starts threatening me like that I go whoa back and off to these people
[40:51.560 --> 40:54.800]  isn't gonna get me safety or my family safety these are bullies they've got to
[40:54.800 --> 40:58.560]  be dealt with and we do that with the info war and we expose these people
[40:58.560 --> 41:01.800]  period they are poisoning our food and water by design they're killing millions
[41:01.800 --> 41:06.960]  of children a year these are murderers I want one one child policy worldwide this
[41:06.960 --> 41:11.520]  is pure evil words cannot describe the magnitude of what we're facing that is
[41:11.520 --> 41:17.480]  the enemy that is a criminal mafia meeting so again Ron Paul comes in Ron Paul
[41:17.480 --> 41:25.400]  comes in and to the subject he comes into the presidential race he really wins
[41:25.400 --> 41:28.920]  the first few primaries they shut that down they're panicking and so when they
[41:28.920 --> 41:33.840]  pull in they drive in and they get out and they start talking about how because
[41:33.840 --> 41:36.840]  I think Watson's headline isn't even strong enough people that accuse us of
[41:36.840 --> 41:40.520]  exaggerating this other way around I guarantee if I was in a semi-public place
[41:40.520 --> 41:44.720]  in front of people like one of these Bilderberg people was and saying I love
[41:44.720 --> 41:51.280]  to load you know we need to load Ron Paul onto a plane with his supporters and
[41:51.280 --> 41:55.840]  blow it up and you know basically say a Muslim extremist did it that that would
[41:55.840 --> 41:59.960]  be a criminal conspiracy plan they would probably get arrested or at least
[41:59.960 --> 42:05.440]  questioned but instead we run the headline Bilderberg share death wish and
[42:05.440 --> 42:08.320]  it's a great headline but I think we should change it to Bilderberg's
[42:08.320 --> 42:12.880]  discuss killing Ron Paul because this is the discussion of killing him I mean if
[42:12.880 --> 42:16.000]  they're openly in a hotel lobby in front of cops the Secret Service going be
[42:16.000 --> 42:20.560]  great if they were on a plane and blew up yeah we'd say a Muslim did it folks
[42:20.560 --> 42:25.560]  imagine what's going on behind closed doors imagine the magnitude so have
[42:25.560 --> 42:29.720]  Carter Watson change that to Bilderberg group discusses killing Ron Paul in
[42:29.720 --> 42:33.160]  stage terror event because that's what we're really looking at Rob do what's
[42:33.160 --> 42:35.840]  your take on this and then we'll go to that video well I'm gonna go to that
[42:35.840 --> 42:40.400]  exact quote this is what one of the Bilderberg members expressed his desire
[42:40.400 --> 42:44.320]  quote get Ron Paul and all of his supporters on an airplane with a
[42:44.320 --> 42:48.480]  Muslim suicide pilot and take him down are they implying they control Muslim
[42:48.480 --> 42:51.560]  suicide pilots at that point because how else are you gonna get a Muslim
[42:51.560 --> 42:55.160]  suicide pilot on there you know so I think right there they're just admitting
[42:55.160 --> 42:59.640]  interpretation exactly go ahead yeah and and then you know take him down this
[42:59.640 --> 43:03.000]  was according to Tucker's source who has been proven routinely accurate on
[43:03.000 --> 43:06.800]  Bilderberg information in the past this is the harshest comment made but there
[43:06.800 --> 43:10.320]  are a lot of mean-spirited comments made by the Bilderberg boys gathered in the
[43:10.320 --> 43:14.600]  lobby of the hotel so they were it wasn't just a one-time this wasn't a
[43:14.600 --> 43:19.560]  one-off comment this has continued wishing that Ron Paul dies they're
[43:19.560 --> 43:22.440]  basically wishing that Ron Paul and his supporters are wiped off the face of the
[43:22.440 --> 43:26.200]  earth and well guess they're already doing that I am no matter what you do
[43:26.200 --> 43:29.520]  you only proved everybody that we've been right about you world government's
[43:29.520 --> 43:33.560]  out in the open world taxes they're banning free speech in Australia the
[43:33.560 --> 43:38.520]  TSA is on the highways drones it's all coming true and I'm so sad you think I
[43:38.520 --> 43:42.000]  was mad when Tucker Carlson's people came out here yesterday and made fun of me
[43:42.000 --> 43:45.560]  and said you know I just wanted money and all this stuff the classic thing I
[43:45.560 --> 43:49.600]  felt sad that they're posing as libertarians and then would do an
[43:49.600 --> 43:52.880]  article today making fun of caring about the Bilderberg group because they
[43:52.880 --> 43:57.120]  can't say this exists oh yeah the Jenna 21's real and the UN wants to ban your
[43:57.120 --> 44:01.160]  kids doing home chores or farm chores and ensure world government's being
[44:01.160 --> 44:04.080]  announced in the Financial Times and hundreds of other papers and the guy
[44:04.080 --> 44:06.840]  from the Financial Times that wrote the article and now for world government
[44:06.840 --> 44:12.600]  is here right now and wrote in the FT yes it's secret yes we're authoritarian
[44:12.600 --> 44:16.520]  yes we're setting up world government but you're bad if you don't like it and
[44:16.520 --> 44:20.320]  then they won't even read Time Magazine saying global government's gonna save
[44:20.320 --> 44:24.120]  us or the Economist saying it's now a technocracy run by elites we're getting
[44:24.120 --> 44:28.080]  rid of freedom we're gonna shut down the free web I get Tucker Carlson's people
[44:28.080 --> 44:33.160]  out here siding against this country with with glee I mean they said at least
[44:33.160 --> 44:36.160]  at least these cops look kind of sad and embarrassed as they're writing tickets
[44:36.160 --> 44:39.140]  and hang their heads and off record say look we're just being told to do this
[44:39.140 --> 44:43.160]  we're just being ordered so stop getting my face it doesn't at least they
[44:43.160 --> 44:48.480]  aren't proud of it he's got a big smirk on his face he's got a big smirk on his

[48:02.720 --> 48:06.120]  them down that was the harshest comment made but there were a lot of mean
[48:06.120 --> 48:13.080]  spirited comments made as the gilbert boys gathered in the lobby the hotel so

[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:23.360]  have the headset on so we're gonna go to a couple more here's here's a great
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:29.040]  news story that I saw this morning the cable news nightmare CNN and Pierce
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:33.680]  Morgan in audience crisis this is from the independent viewers are turning off
[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:39.280]  in droves lured by brash rivals and the popularity of what what internet news
[01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:43.400]  sources that's the people's media that's you and that's me we're making that
[01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:47.800]  happen right now we're the ones causing CNN and the rest of them to go into
[01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:52.240]  freefall some people are still going to Fox because you know that's the obvious
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:55.720]  underdog in this left-right paradigm and they're the ones who are going to get
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:10:00.080]  more of the viewers just like CNN and MSNBC had more viewers when George Bush
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:04.560]  was in office who by the way was at the White House yesterday for his putrid
[01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:09.880]  unveiling and and I think it's great that they have Obama's blaming Bush for
[01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:14.080]  the bad economy guess what Obama you inherited it you got to fix it and we
[01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:17.240]  know you're not doing anything because your banker masters are telling you
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:20.040]  what to do and you know what you're doing you're just giving them more money
[01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:23.720]  you think that's what the solution is and you know what the solution is you
[01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:26.760]  know the solution is you should step down because you're not born in this
[01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:31.160]  country and that's going to come out we all know it's going to come out so let's
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:34.800]  show some of the footage now we can just go to the video feed and you can see
[01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:38.360]  some of what's going on right now of course the police had barricades set up
[01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:42.760]  they've been pulling people over left and right and really just making a mess
[01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:46.360]  of things for anybody trying to get in there and protest but the people will
[01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:51.640]  not be silenced the people are there right now they're taking time away from
[01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:55.760]  their jobs from their lives because they know this is the most important fight
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:11:04.320]  right now is that the Westfields Marriott in Chantilly go ahead Alex

[01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:02.840]  most of the protesters are going to go over to where the one of the larger
[01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:06.440]  conference rooms is that is actually closest if they're only about 30 feet
[01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:10.440]  away from where that fence line is that they've erected and put up black so you
[01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:13.920]  can't see behind it and they're gonna go down there and they're gonna disrupt
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:18.600]  their meeting they're gonna make their day just go a little bit harder this is
[01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:24.040]  where they're really meeting exactly the entrance over here but down there is the
[01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:28.760]  corner of the conference area the closest we can get to them so those that
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:32.600]  want to walk down there about a hundred yards come with us and let's let's yell
[01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:36.080]  at the globalist and we're gonna go right back to them when they get there

[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:45.520]  watching it all live with the power of technology the power of the people we're

[01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:12.480]  the big conference center sticks off the one area where the conference center
[01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:16.000]  sticks off and you're only about 30 40 feet from where they're actually meeting
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:24.320]  it turns out the one spot close to the road is actually I can hear you Alex go

[01:18:32.260 --> 01:18:37.700]  all fighting against tyranny. You notice there's no one type of person out there. It's everybody
[01:18:37.700 --> 01:18:42.100]  because we're all Americans and we all are going against freedom. We've got breaking news.
[01:18:42.820 --> 01:18:47.940]  We've got breaking news, dude. Go ahead. The Associated Press is here. We finally forced the
[01:18:47.940 --> 01:18:54.020]  dinosaur media to cover the criminal event and the Logan Act. Yes. I think at times the Drudge
[01:18:54.020 --> 01:18:59.940]  Report world that daily info wars dot com broke the first blockade and we commend everybody and
[01:18:59.940 --> 01:19:04.340]  everybody that's here. But the Associated Press, believe me, that's the biggest news outfit that
[01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:10.020]  feeds all the main propaganda chains. If they're here, a big deal. We need to continue to demand
[01:19:10.020 --> 01:19:15.860]  the media cover this real event. If you have 130 movie stars meeting in secret, there'd be 15
[01:19:15.860 --> 01:19:20.420]  helicopters over us right now. So I'm going to go talk to the Associated Press. You guys keep
[01:19:20.420 --> 01:19:27.300]  bullhornin. That's awesome. And we will continue with all the live coverage. In fact, keep one
[01:19:27.300 --> 01:19:31.460]  live stream going. Keep a little screen on me just so people can see what's going on.
[01:19:32.980 --> 01:19:37.780]  And let me know if Alex jumps in with anything else. I can only hear him when I stop talking,
[01:19:37.780 --> 01:19:43.620]  unfortunately. But yeah, I was checking the Drudge Report right now. I don't see anything yet from
[01:19:43.620 --> 01:19:49.540]  AP. Of course, they are finally forced to be there because you got off your butt and you went out
[01:19:49.540 --> 01:19:55.140]  there and you showed them. And we're going to break right now, but we'll be back with more

[01:24:02.740 --> 01:24:23.860]  All right, we're live. It's the Alex Jones show. I'm sitting in Rob Dew here. Alex Jones is live
[01:24:23.860 --> 01:24:28.180]  in Chantilly right now. He is being interviewed by the mainstream dinosaur media who have decided
[01:24:28.180 --> 01:24:32.340]  to come out and see why the people are protesting because they pretend this event
[01:24:32.340 --> 01:24:36.260]  doesn't exist. We're gonna listen a little bit, see how the audio is, and I'll be right back in.
[01:24:36.260 --> 01:25:06.100]  Let's go to that audio.
[01:25:06.260 --> 01:25:10.260]  It's like Russia. When Putin asked people, you know, to resign from protest, he said it's
[01:25:10.260 --> 01:25:14.260]  born around that. Are you planning to have like a demonstration or something tonight?
[01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:20.740]  Sort of plans for an action or is it going to be concentrated here most of the time?
[01:25:22.580 --> 01:25:28.020]  I am planning, again, at seven or not as more people can arrive, kind of meet out here from like,
[01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:32.420]  we try to meet out here in the middle of the day and also in the evening. It's a little bit cooler.
[01:25:32.420 --> 01:25:36.580]  And then we like to march around in Chantilly and bullhorn them at night. I mean, right here,
[01:25:36.580 --> 01:25:40.420]  we're only about, that's when I put a black here with the fence, so much spot to have that.
[01:25:40.420 --> 01:25:44.980]  We're only about 30, 40 feet from the main convention wing where they're meeting right now.
[01:25:45.860 --> 01:25:49.940]  Four years ago, we had Richard and Haas and the CFR come out and just give us, go the hell look.
[01:25:49.940 --> 01:25:54.020]  I mean, the police can kill him, he'd be dead. He was just burning with anger because we were
[01:25:54.020 --> 01:26:03.060]  bullhorn, I was bullhorn for hours. Usually they kick you out the Thursday morning.
[01:26:03.060 --> 01:26:07.940]  They were kicking people out on Monday, Tuesday. I, my guys got here Tuesday night, threw them out.
[01:26:07.940 --> 01:26:12.660]  I got here Wednesday morning and they had police meet me and come out and say,
[01:26:12.660 --> 01:26:20.340]  I'm welcome here. Do I have rooms? They said they were renovating. And then another person said,
[01:26:20.340 --> 01:26:25.140]  no, we're over full. So, and there's no billy bird meeting, of course, there's no billy bird
[01:26:25.140 --> 01:26:31.380]  meeting happening. Of course, four years ago, the New York Times did a review of a film called
[01:26:31.380 --> 01:26:36.340]  New World Order that I was in just covering this. And they actually said I was in it at the
[01:26:36.340 --> 01:26:42.420]  Chantilly's imagining men, imagining secret service men talking into their sleeves.
[01:26:42.420 --> 01:26:46.180]  I mean, they said it wasn't here. And they said I was having a full on event out here,
[01:26:46.180 --> 01:26:50.660]  it's just a friend of mine. That's their disdain for the public. That's why I breached the Guardian
[01:26:50.660 --> 01:26:53.780]  four years ago and today. You guys have been covering this for a while,
[01:26:53.780 --> 01:26:58.340]  covering, because it's a real event. It's like debos, but it's secret. And imagine the New York
[01:26:58.340 --> 01:27:02.260]  Times told its readers, you can look it up, that it wasn't happening.
[01:27:02.260 --> 01:27:28.100]  We decided to come out. Why? Because you showed up because all the protesters out there showed
[01:27:28.100 --> 01:27:32.900]  up here. We got more cops here. Look, trying to arrest people. Look at that. Look at that.
[01:27:32.900 --> 01:27:41.380]  They're arresting somebody live on TV right now. You guys are all wrong. You guys got it all wrong.
[01:27:42.900 --> 01:27:48.180]  Oh my goodness. What did they take that guy away for? He wasn't doing anything. He was crossing the
[01:27:48.180 --> 01:27:59.300]  street. They just came out and singled some guy out of the crowd and grabbed him and took off.
[01:27:59.300 --> 01:28:10.100]  Get off the street. Thousands of people watching. Thousands of people right now, thousands.
[01:28:10.660 --> 01:28:16.340]  They're just singling people out and grabbing them.
[01:28:16.340 --> 01:28:24.900]  thousands of people watching thousands of people watching thousands of people watching right now
[01:28:24.900 --> 01:28:31.060]  thousands of people watching this guy's filming with it over again this is a
[01:28:31.060 --> 01:28:39.060]  this is incredible right now they have a protestor a peaceful protestor he wasn't
[01:28:39.060 --> 01:28:43.220]  doing anything wrong they have pinned up against the car and it looked like all he was doing was
[01:28:43.220 --> 01:28:53.540]  crossing the street we're watching it live as it unfolds right now the site is shantilly
[01:28:53.540 --> 01:29:00.340]  virginia it's the site of the builderburg 2012 meeting at the westfields maria looks like we just
[01:29:00.340 --> 01:29:08.180]  lost a signal off of one of the uh you streams look at that treating that man like he's a terrorist
[01:29:08.180 --> 01:29:15.060]  when the real terrorists are right inside the building right inside over there
[01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:19.460]  total travesty
[01:29:27.540 --> 01:29:32.020]  all right all right we're about to go to break we'll be back with more the dinosaur media is

[01:33:16.820 --> 01:33:21.700]  just trying to walk around the crowd a quarter inch out in the side they just did it as an example
[01:33:21.700 --> 01:33:27.300]  to the slave americans this is an occupied country run by bilgerberg and the foreign banks they did
[01:33:27.300 --> 01:33:32.420]  it as a message they psychologically profile these guys kind of like little kid types you just want
[01:33:32.420 --> 01:33:36.500]  to exercise power over and over again i was talking to this gentleman you said what would happen if
[01:33:36.500 --> 01:33:42.340]  we all just stepped out that's what happens in 1776 right here on the road what are they going
[01:33:42.340 --> 01:33:48.340]  all you gonna rush this whole crowd again that's you're gonna rush the whole crowd again that the
[01:33:48.340 --> 01:33:55.540]  issue here is no the point is is that they couldn't stop us if we all did the point is though
[01:33:55.540 --> 01:34:00.180]  the reason we're not going to do that is we're already winning we've got the washington post
[01:34:00.180 --> 01:34:06.580]  the associated press the london guardian salon all of them out here we win oh look they're leaving
[01:34:06.580 --> 01:34:11.540]  now because they because they don't want to give us a chance to step out against them they know
[01:34:11.540 --> 01:34:16.100]  their psychological warfare we were all just about to step out on the street now they're going to
[01:34:16.100 --> 01:34:21.140]  get riot cops which is even better but i'm telling you again that's how psych warfare works the minute
[01:34:21.140 --> 01:34:26.340]  you came up and said what happens if we who are a couple hundred just in this group step out against
[01:34:26.340 --> 01:34:29.620]  their 20 and they all backed off just like when everybody said they were going to have national
[01:34:29.620 --> 01:34:33.940]  opt out day for a week they did no groping or scanning they don't want to give us a chance
[01:34:33.940 --> 01:34:38.740]  to show that we have the power all the drones all the surveillance they're wanting us to think
[01:34:38.740 --> 01:34:47.220]  we're powerless we're not come to shantilly it's 1776 part two it's happening now get your butts
[01:34:47.220 --> 01:34:54.580]  here ladies and gentlemen this is it this is it this is the reality all right ladies and gentlemen
[01:34:54.580 --> 01:34:58.980]  let's continue on rob do i'll be back in a little while i'm going to go talk to the medium all right
[01:34:58.980 --> 01:35:05.060]  that was alex jones explaining why they singled out a a single protester who stepped right off
[01:35:05.060 --> 01:35:11.460]  onto the curb apparently onto the street the cops swarmed him grabbed him put him in handcuffs and
[01:35:11.460 --> 01:35:16.500]  took him away there's another guy who who said what if we all step out you're going to arrest us all
[01:35:16.500 --> 01:35:20.820]  started standing up to him and they all backed down all the cops walked away and they'll probably
[01:35:20.820 --> 01:35:26.260]  be back with riot shields and masks and tear gas ready to beat on the american people ready to
[01:35:26.260 --> 01:35:31.860]  beat on their fellow citizens because those people that's right they are cowards they're cowards
[01:35:31.860 --> 01:35:36.820]  behind a badge and i do know what it's like because yes i was arrested for filming
[01:35:37.940 --> 01:35:43.380]  the cops beating up peaceful protesters and college students in fact we have an article
[01:35:43.380 --> 01:35:49.700]  today written by kurt nimo photography a crime against the state and global elite and the arrest
[01:35:49.700 --> 01:35:54.580]  of an activist taking photos of an arriving bill deberg member is part of a growing trend in america
[01:35:54.580 --> 01:35:59.220]  photographers all over the country are being harassed interrogated and arrested for taking
[01:35:59.220 --> 01:36:04.500]  photographs in public citing overblown and often imaginary terrorist threats the federal government
[01:36:04.500 --> 01:36:08.900]  now actively encourages police behavior that is the hallmark of totalitarian and communist
[01:36:08.900 --> 01:36:15.860]  countries not a former constitutional republic and you can read more about that on info wars.com
[01:36:15.860 --> 01:36:23.140]  that articles from kurt nimo we have two pages up where you can get all the bill deberg news
[01:36:23.140 --> 01:36:28.340]  it's on the top of our featured section bill deberg breaking news and live video from bill
[01:36:28.340 --> 01:36:35.380]  deberg 2012 where you can actually access our news stream which has uh right now about 16 000
[01:36:35.380 --> 01:36:40.420]  viewers current right now it's moving up and down around there we have our justin tv link
[01:36:40.420 --> 01:36:46.180]  we also have our youtube stream and alex jones's quick channel i guess that was added last night
[01:36:46.180 --> 01:36:50.740]  because that's what it's all about finding those media finding those pieces of media that we can add
[01:36:51.620 --> 01:36:57.460]  putting it together and keep hammering them as long as we keep hammering them it will not stop
[01:36:57.460 --> 01:37:02.180]  and freedom will grow and that's what's happening right now the crowd is growing at chantilly
[01:37:02.180 --> 01:37:07.140]  alex jones estimates it's around 500 right now it's only getting bigger and it can get bigger
[01:37:07.140 --> 01:37:12.180]  when you go there you need to get there right now if you're within 200 miles you can be there in three
[01:37:12.180 --> 01:37:19.460]  hours you can be there helping out people are are coming together it's america this is this is what
[01:37:19.460 --> 01:37:25.300]  it's part about being an american it's about standing up and saying this is wrong this is not right
[01:37:25.300 --> 01:37:29.460]  and it's not right for these people to be meeting in secret it's not right that we don't know what
[01:37:29.460 --> 01:37:35.300]  they're talking about it's not right that they are having security arrest people for stopping on the
[01:37:35.300 --> 01:37:39.460]  side of the road to let people out are stopping in a parking lot to let people out they're arresting
[01:37:39.460 --> 01:37:44.260]  people for taking photographs they're arresting people for crossing the street they're arresting
[01:37:44.260 --> 01:37:50.180]  people for are they're giving tickets to people for just dropping people off it's crazy and we
[01:37:50.180 --> 01:37:54.660]  should not allow this in our country and i've even got some friends in virginia that live close by
[01:37:54.660 --> 01:37:59.700]  i'm calling on them all right all right alex jones is doing another interview but first i want to
[01:37:59.700 --> 01:38:04.500]  call out anybody in chantilly virginia get there now let's go to alex jones live
[01:38:05.860 --> 01:38:10.020]  when he's a foreign editor who wrote an awful world government saying yeah we're authoritarian
[01:38:10.020 --> 01:38:14.420]  yeah we were secret it's for your own good we know best he's here today the only presence here are
[01:38:14.420 --> 01:38:19.700]  people that literally say i want authoritarian world government he actually wrote that he said yes
[01:38:19.700 --> 01:38:24.660]  we're secret yes we're authoritarian because we know best i mean that's it this is the richest people
[01:38:24.660 --> 01:38:32.500]  in the world meeting with key national security nsa people mi6 european security heads uh von rumpi
[01:38:32.500 --> 01:38:39.220]  of the european central uh you know bank system and uh of european union uh council they're all here
[01:38:39.780 --> 01:38:44.740]  they control the issuance of money and credit this is it top of the pyramid how does it remain
[01:38:44.740 --> 01:38:49.140]  so secretive how does it remain something that so few people you know are aware of well because the
[01:38:49.140 --> 01:38:53.540]  mainstream media in the united states has never covered until now and man first it was the drudge
[01:38:53.540 --> 01:38:57.700]  report which wouldn't really call mainstream media but he helped break it out then the washington times
[01:38:57.700 --> 01:39:02.500]  world net daily one in guardian for four years overseas really started breaking it uh that was a
[01:39:02.500 --> 01:39:06.020]  big deal when you got to recover at four years ago with charlie schueltin at first a little bit
[01:39:06.020 --> 01:39:09.940]  laughingly then he got harassed arrested don't know why this is really real and media said it
[01:39:09.940 --> 01:39:15.460]  didn't exist to him so so it's the fact that they play that jet on mind trick if this doesn't exist
[01:39:16.020 --> 01:39:20.420]  you know but yeah there's limousines and the new york times says no then another one and they
[01:39:20.420 --> 01:39:26.100]  actually talk to the readers like they're idiots so the fact that the system said this didn't exist
[01:39:26.100 --> 01:39:30.900]  they've lost all credibility run over the top it was just hey it's a private debos then it would
[01:39:30.900 --> 01:39:33.860]  have been reported on but they wanted to keep it secret because they're violating the logon
[01:39:34.740 --> 01:39:39.460]  after some speculation about presidents being chosen vice presidents being chosen
[01:39:39.460 --> 01:39:43.140]  what's going on with that tony blare two years before he came from nowhere to become the prime
[01:39:43.140 --> 01:39:49.300]  minister was here and then basically certified uh margaret thatcher even talked to jim tucker and
[01:39:49.300 --> 01:39:53.940]  people about that uh you know the fact that bill berg rotted her out because she wouldn't go along
[01:39:53.940 --> 01:39:58.020]  with him because she wouldn't turn over british sovereign he wasn't she was perfect um we've
[01:39:58.020 --> 01:40:03.860]  got uh bill clinton little known governor comes here in 91 boom fast-tracked they like it it's on
[01:40:03.860 --> 01:40:11.860]  uh we've seen uh countless others john edwards gordon brown john carrey uh obama was here four
[01:40:11.860 --> 01:40:16.660]  years ago we talked our sources inside people saw him secret service at p five looks i'm up to

[01:44:31.620 --> 01:44:37.780]  really bad and everybody here has a camera everyone here is filming this how do you think that's
[01:44:37.780 --> 01:44:42.020]  sort of changed change the nature of the game covering this right there a lot of information
[01:44:42.020 --> 01:44:46.100]  i haven't had a chance to look at the numbers this year i sent two reporters to sweatshirt on the
[01:44:46.100 --> 01:44:51.140]  st paulbridge uh and it was expensive to get there we can hardly budge there are people that came from
[01:44:51.140 --> 01:44:56.020]  the u.s people that live in europe who are sleeping you know on the grass to try to get to when they
[01:44:56.020 --> 01:45:00.340]  got there was over a thousand people at one point by the last night there by the saturday evening
[01:45:00.340 --> 01:45:07.140]  before the half day the next sunday and it was just incredible what was the question oh
[01:45:07.140 --> 01:45:14.900]  yeah oh yeah oh yeah number we had 3.5 million views you know look at it on a justin tv channel
[01:45:14.900 --> 01:45:18.420]  that had like a hundred thousand views we just used every once in a while for live events we had
[01:45:18.420 --> 01:45:27.700]  3.5 million views just on one little screaming system with erin dykes and paul watson they're
[01:45:27.700 --> 01:45:31.940]  covering it if you're i've got millions of listeners every day on my radio show a couple
[01:45:31.940 --> 01:45:37.060]  million some days at the three million but that's a show i've been doing for 17 years we can just
[01:45:37.060 --> 01:45:43.460]  start going and doing maybe 20 live feeds and then they 3.5 million watched in the next few days
[01:45:43.460 --> 01:45:48.420]  just the archives i mean that's amazing you go look at that 3.5 million it's more than that now
[01:45:48.420 --> 01:45:52.740]  there's been a few more on there but we're using a whole bunch of new channels as well i have no
[01:45:52.740 --> 01:45:57.380]  idea how many times it's being watched i was seeing some of the videos were like 400 000 slash few
[01:45:57.380 --> 01:46:04.100]  days i mean this is just amazing we're winning absolutely and that's why the mainline corporate
[01:46:04.100 --> 01:46:07.780]  press has been forced to come out i'm not talking about the guardian you guys have been covered for
[01:46:07.780 --> 01:46:12.820]  four years at least but that's why you've got the associated press out here that's why you've got
[01:46:14.420 --> 01:46:20.260]  other outfits out here it's very exciting so we're at least having a debate with the real
[01:46:20.260 --> 01:46:24.500]  perpetrators we're not always facing our little puppet president or the public prime minister
[01:46:24.500 --> 01:46:28.340]  and then oh the motorcade and all the big media coverage the reason there's not coverage of this
[01:46:28.340 --> 01:46:32.820]  and i've talked to time Warner people and others it's because they've been told you cover this
[01:46:32.820 --> 01:46:36.740]  you're not going to get advanced there is a development to give them the order anymore
[01:46:36.740 --> 01:46:42.820]  it's like you cover that i talked to a guy at Reuters six years ago on the phone he was going
[01:46:42.820 --> 01:46:46.340]  to publish the story he goes no i think it will get out it's all of the painting papers you got
[01:46:46.340 --> 01:46:50.980]  same 15 hours this is you know this is in like 15 papers this is in toronto star out of a citizen
[01:46:50.980 --> 01:46:55.300]  and front page i can get this out he calls me and he goes man you're really right wow this
[01:46:55.300 --> 01:47:00.260]  has never happened to me he goes it's not being published he thanked the media for not yeah yeah
[01:47:00.260 --> 01:47:04.580]  he thanked them but that deal and the guy said wow this is really real because he said i'm an editor
[01:47:04.580 --> 01:47:09.300]  you know it was it was out of i want to say it was out of a texas office he said i have never
[01:47:09.300 --> 01:47:15.220]  seen anything like this show show so that's what's going on they do not want this information out
[01:47:15.220 --> 01:47:21.780]  there thank you buddy sorry i'm coughing i think a lot of germs out here i know how you're doing
[01:47:21.780 --> 01:47:26.740]  all right right i know you're used to a lot of snarky kind of people snooting at you but i'm
[01:47:26.740 --> 01:47:30.660]  going to try to be very substantive and try to you know get well i don't want to judge you by the
[01:47:30.660 --> 01:47:35.220]  other guys everybody back on the camera that's a reasonable conclusion which i want to practice
[01:47:35.220 --> 01:47:40.020]  by saying that i'm going to try to be you know as a strange shooting is hey a few snarky comments
[01:47:40.020 --> 01:47:45.380]  were nothing from you guys the caller was just like like it is like two-year-olds yes well they
[01:47:45.380 --> 01:47:48.580]  always do that they just said like videographers out outdoor rallies and she's trying to make
[01:47:48.580 --> 01:47:54.260]  anyone who demonstrates looks silly yeah it's that amenization people that actually care um so
[01:47:54.260 --> 01:47:58.660]  better get on the straight buddy maybe you should know i remember a couple of months ago you were
[01:47:58.660 --> 01:48:04.100]  you were uh one of the leading proponents of the theory listening yeah i am the police are coming
[01:48:04.100 --> 01:48:10.420]  out of the way it's like last time okay did you want to wait sir until i get here you saw us coming
[01:48:10.420 --> 01:48:16.580]  next time do me a favor just step out of the road do you understand it's like giving you a warning
[01:48:16.580 --> 01:48:22.900]  do you understand thank you so it's not allowed to step on the road the road we have a sidewalk you
[01:48:22.900 --> 01:48:26.980]  stay on a sidewalk all right you're subjecting me to be in danger if you would stay out of the
[01:48:26.980 --> 01:48:40.980]  street i won't be here oh here we go okay we got it we're not in the screen
[01:48:44.420 --> 01:48:48.180]  so a couple months ago you were one of the leading proponents of the theory that the occupied
[01:48:48.180 --> 01:48:54.340]  movement is a george soros funded and now you've adopted occupy kind of nomenclature to attract
[01:48:54.340 --> 01:49:00.260]  people to come thank you for what changed in your thinking that led you to be more open to using
[01:49:00.260 --> 01:49:03.540]  that kind of nomenclature well that's actually a complex question from the media but it's still
[01:49:03.540 --> 01:49:11.380]  not complex enough i said from day one that the system put a lot of individual items about the
[01:49:11.380 --> 01:49:16.900]  idea of go after wall street which is which is a generalization of the core criminal insider
[01:49:16.900 --> 01:49:20.180]  groups that are operating is that a fair question i mean that that's a fair question well i don't
[01:49:20.180 --> 01:49:24.580]  think it's it's not accurate i could see from a two-dimensional perspective that from some of
[01:49:24.580 --> 01:49:31.780]  what i've said i criticized the fact that the system tried to co-opt it and i myself tried to
[01:49:31.780 --> 01:49:36.580]  say hey let's go after the private fellow reserve let's go after the globalist let's go after
[01:49:36.580 --> 01:49:42.900]  woman sex jp morgan the real top of the pyramid not just we want socialism which isn't what all
[01:49:42.900 --> 01:49:48.500]  people were saying so i was saying look out you know move on all them are trying to take it over
[01:49:48.500 --> 01:49:53.300]  so i went around and went to rallies and tried to say hey let's go after you know the the crony
[01:49:53.300 --> 01:49:59.700]  capitalist that are monopoly people and the opposite of free market yeah and so i did that so so this
[01:49:59.700 --> 01:50:06.820]  is yet another attempt so yes you're right use the word occupy like how about occupy america how
[01:50:06.820 --> 01:50:12.420]  about occupy freedom again how about everywhere be a free speech though you know so so so yes uh
[01:50:12.420 --> 01:50:15.940]  i mean i did use the terms i thought it would capture people's imagination hey let's occupy
[01:50:15.940 --> 01:50:21.460]  belterberg let's actually not just say let's go occupy you know any any any company that's been
[01:50:21.460 --> 01:50:26.420]  successful like that's bad let's actually go after the insiders that are fat off corporate welfare
[01:50:26.420 --> 01:50:32.180]  and do any of your supporters kind of show uh remiss that the use of occupy as as a token
[01:50:32.180 --> 01:50:36.580]  some of those are like oh that's that's you know you know that's a toros communism stuff and i was
[01:50:36.580 --> 01:50:41.300]  like wait a minute you can't just let somebody they ever use the word occupy now they take it
[01:50:41.300 --> 01:50:45.220]  all right there's alex jones right there being interviewed by some members of the mainstream

[01:54:13.220 --> 01:54:18.180]  Alex Jones here live salon reporter what's your name sir michael michael michael what
[01:54:18.180 --> 01:54:23.300]  tracy michael tracy's interviewing us and he's bringing up the standard wedge issues stuff about
[01:54:23.300 --> 01:54:28.500]  you think ron paul would like the fact that people are out here and what do you think of the staffers
[01:54:28.500 --> 01:54:32.740]  some of his staffers probably don't like 9-11 truthers all i know is ron paul has talked about
[01:54:32.740 --> 01:54:37.300]  false flag terror that the cia brings in the drugs uh and that bin laden did work for the
[01:54:37.300 --> 01:54:42.260]  u.s government and uh i just can't wait till down the road and ron paul put some books out in the
[01:54:42.260 --> 01:54:47.140]  future uh because uh you know the guy likes ron paul just because they've got some staff members
[01:54:47.140 --> 01:54:51.540]  that are 25 years old and want to go work you know for some old uh you know uh republican
[01:54:51.540 --> 01:54:55.460]  establishment persons so they've tried to keep ron paul away from his real constituents i'm not
[01:54:55.460 --> 01:54:59.300]  even worried about that that's not even on my radar screen when ron paul's on my radio show i don't
[01:54:59.300 --> 01:55:04.020]  even bring up 9 11 issues with him because i'm talking about the private fellow reserve i'm not
[01:55:04.020 --> 01:55:09.060]  about all the new wars i'm talking about all the other serious things that are happening and going
[01:55:09.060 --> 01:55:14.260]  on the fact that i don't buy the official story of 9 11 that is like nails on a chalkboard to the
[01:55:14.260 --> 01:55:18.580]  establishment what's your comment on the campaign staff announcing if they're gonna they're gonna
[01:55:18.580 --> 01:55:22.660]  stop the what's my comment on the campaign staff announcing that they're going to stay in the
[01:55:22.660 --> 01:55:26.420]  microphone that they're going that the campaign staff announced that they're not going to do
[01:55:26.420 --> 01:55:31.700]  yes suspending trying to spend money that disillusioned a lot of grassroots folks like adam kokesh for
[01:55:31.700 --> 01:55:35.620]  example went out to tirade about it on the on the internet saying that you know you're basically
[01:55:35.620 --> 01:55:40.340]  talking to my basically proclaiming that he'd been betrayed that these uh that these establishment
[01:55:40.340 --> 01:55:44.340]  types within the ron paul kind of apparatus taken over the message and supplanted the real
[01:55:44.340 --> 01:55:52.660]  grassroots momentum yeah i think this is all just attempts to tarnish the ron paul movement and
[01:55:52.660 --> 01:55:57.300]  legacy that threatens the bilterberg group so much inside the bilterberg group is talking about how
[01:55:57.300 --> 01:56:02.660]  they want ron paul dead inside for multiple sources i mean they're running around in expletive
[01:56:02.660 --> 01:56:10.900]  laden tirades against him and what was your question your question was about the reaction on
[01:56:10.900 --> 01:56:17.620]  on the part of some that oh yeah listen listen sure sure sure sure again that was the campaign
[01:56:17.620 --> 01:56:23.380]  staff saying we're suspending actively campaigning in states because we don't have the money but
[01:56:23.380 --> 01:56:28.980]  we're going to continue with with the delegate process to bring our issues to the floor and
[01:56:28.980 --> 01:56:34.740]  continue the info war ron paul has won by simply going forward and so there's not any in fighting
[01:56:34.740 --> 01:56:39.700]  going on in campaign for liberty there's none of that going on some of the younger not as
[01:56:39.700 --> 01:56:45.140]  sophisticated members of ron paul staff get baited into this stuff i don't uh we're moving
[01:56:45.140 --> 01:56:48.580]  forward we're winning more people know about the new world order more people know about the fellow
[01:56:48.580 --> 01:56:52.660]  reserve the corporate media has been forced to cover this stuff did ron paul get baited into a
[01:56:52.660 --> 01:56:57.540]  private meeting with romney last week you know what i've been so busy that uh i didn't know about
[01:56:57.540 --> 01:57:01.140]  that meeting they had a meeting well i'm not surprised because let me tell you they're looking
[01:57:01.140 --> 01:57:06.020]  at him for vp ron paul's gonna be vp and somebody who uh wants i'm gonna pick if somebody wants to
[01:57:06.020 --> 01:57:10.500]  expand the size of the military well rand has told me publicly sure sure ron paul has told me i mean
[01:57:10.500 --> 01:57:19.460]  ron paul has told me publicly it looks like because we're back because uh because he would
[01:57:19.460 --> 01:57:25.940]  never uh ron paul is just repeating as we just blipped off from it on the radio ron paul has
[01:57:25.940 --> 01:57:31.060]  told me on the air and also during a break that uh it would probably never happen because he's not
[01:57:31.060 --> 01:57:35.380]  going to compromise did he have a meeting with him that you're just now telling me about and so
[01:57:35.380 --> 01:57:41.380]  i'm believing you i'm sure discussing that uh or something along those lines i wouldn't be against
[01:57:41.380 --> 01:57:44.980]  ron paul being in there if he could say whatever he wanted and do whatever he wanted and talk about
[01:57:44.980 --> 01:57:50.500]  the new world order but no that's why ron paul says that it's probably not gonna have
[01:57:50.500 --> 01:57:58.660]  that and i just pulled it up uh meeting with rand paul mit romney tries to tame tempest
[01:57:58.660 --> 01:58:05.620]  and um that's out of abc news i'm gonna bring my laptop are we on here still okay you're back

[02:00:41.700 --> 02:00:48.420]  about the possibility of a romney ran paul ticket for vp and apparently they had a meeting on the
[02:00:48.420 --> 02:00:54.180]  23rd of may lasted about 30 minutes it was a said it was a closed door meeting
[02:00:56.580 --> 02:01:01.460]  you know so who knows maybe that could happen i personally don't think that ran paul is going
[02:01:01.460 --> 02:01:06.660]  to be muzzled he's definitely too outspoken on too many issues that romney favors which is mainly
[02:01:06.660 --> 02:01:15.700]  wars more wars of aggression going after other people's minerals and oils stuff like that
[02:01:15.700 --> 02:01:19.700]  so i don't think that's going to be reality i think maybe he's just testing the waters maybe
[02:01:19.700 --> 02:01:25.220]  to try to calm people down as soon as we get that feed back up and it sounds good we'll go back to
[02:01:25.220 --> 02:01:31.780]  him back to alex jones in virginia he's leading the protest and it's a movement with no leader
[02:01:31.780 --> 02:01:38.260]  everybody out there is a leader everybody out there is taking action alex jones is just happens to
[02:01:38.260 --> 02:01:45.220]  have built a you know his own media empire with his own two hands and with the help of listeners
[02:01:45.220 --> 02:01:51.940]  from around the world we're not sponsored by mbc ms mbc lockheed martin all right we're going

[02:02:25.540 --> 02:02:32.660]  understand that he's too busy uh growing his beard yeah the other guy was from the guardian
[02:02:33.620 --> 02:02:38.740]  so uh what else is going on right now um the associated press still here
[02:02:38.740 --> 02:02:44.820]  because i got to see the associated press we must see the press pass that's just amazing
[02:02:44.820 --> 02:02:50.100]  that the associated press was out here does he have a press pass alex does he have a press pass
[02:02:50.100 --> 02:02:59.860]  this is the question hey what i'm brother hey so i don't know if you heard uh i'm just informing
[02:02:59.860 --> 02:03:05.220]  you alex it seems like on the 23rd that ran paul and romney had a closed door meeting for about 30
[02:03:05.220 --> 02:03:13.220]  minutes um it doesn't say i i assume it's it was face to face it doesn't say if it was but um and
[02:03:13.220 --> 02:03:18.420]  that's about it probably means face to face nothing really else um on that can i sit every five minutes
[02:03:20.900 --> 02:03:28.820]  oh ah anyways we broadcast live right now we're live alex go ahead what do you have to say
[02:03:29.540 --> 02:03:33.220]  no it's just hard to broadcast out here because people are all the great patriots who try to shake

[02:08:34.740 --> 02:08:38.660]  than yesterday i know this is going to be that 300 or so more people are arriving the police are
[02:08:38.660 --> 02:08:45.060]  now a mile away trying to stop people but there's some side streets where you can get dropped off
[02:08:45.060 --> 02:08:49.620]  or brought by a shuttle from your hotel uh don't try to stay at the high at the police marched in
[02:08:49.620 --> 02:08:54.500]  in front of us and said you don't take people anywhere from this hotel you're living in north
[02:08:54.500 --> 02:09:00.340]  korea uh we've seen them arresting people for any reason they can and we've also seen them
[02:09:00.340 --> 02:09:06.020]  just writing tickets of people to even pull over in in parking lanes to let people out it's unprecedented
[02:09:06.020 --> 02:09:11.540]  now we're joined by kevin dina of world net daily is that right diana diana hey man i knew you
[02:09:11.540 --> 02:09:16.180]  and i met you the other day you're awesome i've seen your videos but i'm brain dead today uh so
[02:09:16.180 --> 02:09:20.020]  kevin's here with us from world net daily and uh now i'm calling world net daily something else
[02:09:20.020 --> 02:09:24.260]  i'm getting tired doing this and uh michael thompson hey i can't miss that a marketing
[02:09:24.260 --> 02:09:28.180]  coordinator and of course you write for him and do a bunch of other stuff and so i'm going to use
[02:09:28.180 --> 02:09:32.740]  my headset uh as just a mic for both of you because our other mic's not not working i mean this is
[02:09:32.740 --> 02:09:38.100]  cutting edge media coverage that you guys are doing at a wnd dot com cutting edge we're doing
[02:09:38.100 --> 02:09:43.380]  over at info wars dot com you know you guys have been as big as say something like the washington
[02:09:43.380 --> 02:09:47.300]  times online are bigger for years give all your print editions one of the biggest independent
[02:09:47.300 --> 02:09:52.980]  publishers in the country now and so i've got to say uh even before the drudge report was covering
[02:09:52.980 --> 02:09:57.700]  it and he helped break it all you know the dam in the last five years world net daily has been
[02:09:57.700 --> 02:10:01.620]  covering bill bergen's sitting correspondence around what is it like now to see the washington
[02:10:01.620 --> 02:10:07.060]  times covering it now the washington poster today the associated press the london guardian
[02:10:07.060 --> 02:10:12.660]  the dam is breaking we were talking over at your office just the other night uh kevin and you were
[02:10:12.660 --> 02:10:16.420]  very astute when you said you know they're going to be forced to cover it and then they're going to
[02:10:16.420 --> 02:10:21.060]  make jokes about it and that's not going to hold water so uh kevin i'm going to hand the mic to
[02:10:21.060 --> 02:10:24.500]  you i'm not going to sit here and even try to interview because there's one mic i want you to
[02:10:24.500 --> 02:10:28.820]  just take your time breaking down your observations what you've seen and then hand it over to your
[02:10:28.820 --> 02:10:33.940]  other associate michael there here you go my friend all right well i think as we talked about
[02:10:33.940 --> 02:10:38.660]  yesterday it's a game changer on a couple different levels one the fact that they actually have to
[02:10:38.660 --> 02:10:42.820]  have this discussion this is the discussion that they can't win i mean the first thing that they
[02:10:42.820 --> 02:10:46.980]  have to do is try to ignore it and then mock it but now that they actually have to discuss it on the
[02:10:46.980 --> 02:10:52.100]  merits this is something that when people find out about it instinctively they know something's wrong
[02:10:52.100 --> 02:10:56.580]  all these hundreds of people who are here are coming from very diverse ideological backgrounds
[02:10:56.580 --> 02:11:01.460]  just talking to different people but everybody here knows something is deeply wrong about what's
[02:11:01.460 --> 02:11:06.340]  going on in there and everybody is here coming well out of their way to drive here to protest for
[02:11:06.340 --> 02:11:12.340]  that very reason so this is a game changer the second thing that's happening i think is that
[02:11:12.340 --> 02:11:18.260]  you're seeing the uh the mask of oppression it's showing a lot more the fact that the security uh
[02:11:18.260 --> 02:11:22.980]  is becoming a lot more intensified the fact that you're actually seeing arrests today uh the fact
[02:11:22.980 --> 02:11:26.900]  that they're pulling people over who are just driving by some people who don't even really know
[02:11:26.900 --> 02:11:31.140]  what's going on uh the fact that you see people who are honking and then like the cops will like
[02:11:31.140 --> 02:11:35.860]  pull them over like down the road i mean this is all something genuinely new and this is also
[02:11:35.860 --> 02:11:40.180]  something genuinely frightening so that's why this is becoming a legitimate story and that's
[02:11:40.180 --> 02:11:45.220]  why more and more people are becoming interested in it michael you on by the way uh it's got to
[02:11:45.220 --> 02:11:49.700]  be about 400 people now 500 it's a lot bigger than i thought now that i'm standing out here there's
[02:11:49.700 --> 02:11:54.500]  about what 250 yards of just solid people there's more on the other side more coming they're not
[02:11:54.500 --> 02:12:00.260]  stopping people coming here and i've been told the backlash of them trying to keep us uh from
[02:12:00.260 --> 02:12:03.780]  getting here that people all over the country are coming now what do you make of that and then
[02:12:04.420 --> 02:12:08.260]  well it's remarkable because one this isn't a very convenient location i mean it's not like
[02:12:08.260 --> 02:12:12.580]  there's parking nearby or that it's easy to get here people are getting dropped off from a long
[02:12:12.580 --> 02:12:18.260]  ways away and then walking over um again i think this this kind of builds my point once they open
[02:12:18.260 --> 02:12:23.060]  up this debate it's a bad thing because people see it they become interested they start showing up
[02:12:23.060 --> 02:12:27.700]  right and once now now that they actually have to argue against it that's something they really
[02:12:27.700 --> 02:12:32.180]  can't win just by fact that they have to argue against it absolutely a michael thompson well
[02:12:32.180 --> 02:12:35.860]  i guess the only thing i would add is that right now one of the top movies in the world is the
[02:12:35.860 --> 02:12:41.860]  avengers he's all seen the avengers everyone's seen it did anybody uh wonder why the american
[02:12:41.860 --> 02:12:46.100]  government wasn't in that it was some shadowy organization that uh that that was that overheld
[02:12:46.100 --> 02:12:51.780]  the shield anybody notice that alex we were talking about that and uh no it's like nato and now the
[02:12:51.780 --> 02:12:58.420]  un and nato say they run our military treasonously the uh sec death gets up there and tells congress
[02:12:58.420 --> 02:13:02.820]  no we might come to you but the un gives the orders obama says it and that's what all the
[02:13:02.820 --> 02:13:08.580]  movies and children's shows it's all shadowy global groups it's like cobra runs things basically
[02:13:08.580 --> 02:13:15.700]  cobra took america over go ahead so and on that point yes cobra i gotta go with it uh the main
[02:13:15.700 --> 02:13:20.180]  point is the united states military refused to work with the avengers film because they couldn't
[02:13:20.180 --> 02:13:25.380]  figure out who exactly is shield working for and this is uh you know and in the military work with
[02:13:25.380 --> 02:13:30.900]  battleship i mean uh that riana film but they're not working with the avengers the point is uh
[02:13:30.900 --> 02:13:34.900]  that film brought a lot of the aspects that you know alex talks about alex is doing such a great
[02:13:34.900 --> 02:13:38.500]  job and i know he appreciates all you guys coming here and all that he's doing keep going keep going
[02:13:38.500 --> 02:13:43.940]  no i just get that my club okay i know that uh i know that you know a lot of people over the years
[02:13:43.940 --> 02:13:48.820]  have have laughed at the type of things that um that have uh that are being discussed here
[02:13:48.820 --> 02:13:53.460]  that you guys are coming out to report on the facts remain on on on our side i'll say that
[02:13:53.460 --> 02:13:58.660]  without a doubt the facts remain on our side and as more and more people are uh are becoming aware
[02:13:59.220 --> 02:14:04.180]  and realizing uh what's transpiring behind closed doors uh you're gonna start seeing
[02:14:04.180 --> 02:14:08.980]  more and more people want to join uh this group yeah i think what's really important to remember
[02:14:08.980 --> 02:14:12.020]  now and you're saying this with the security you're saying this with the debate that's actually
[02:14:12.020 --> 02:14:17.780]  being happened the mask is being ripped off and now they're not even bothering to disguise it anymore
[02:14:17.780 --> 02:14:23.140]  the agenda is there for all to see and it's just a question of at this point who's side are you on
[02:14:23.940 --> 02:14:29.220]  tell us about the reportage going on roll that daily well we were around here yesterday i talked
[02:14:29.220 --> 02:14:33.940]  with adam kokash and some of you might know and uh some other liberty activists uh we talked with
[02:14:33.940 --> 02:14:39.060]  some of the protesters yesterday we got some video of uh the interactions shall we say with the
[02:14:39.060 --> 02:14:44.260]  police and the security and everything else and i think what's what's interesting about this is i
[02:14:44.260 --> 02:14:49.380]  mean now yeah you have the associated press coming and everything else but the only real
[02:14:49.380 --> 02:14:54.500]  reporting that's being done as far as telling what the actual story is uh it's independent reporting
[02:14:54.500 --> 02:14:59.380]  mostly web-based reporting uh wnd is proud to be a part of that but it's frankly a lot of citizen
[02:14:59.380 --> 02:15:04.900]  journalism as well and i think what's what's really changing here is more and more people i mean
[02:15:04.900 --> 02:15:08.580]  people say this all the time it's almost become a cliche about how the mainstream media is being
[02:15:08.580 --> 02:15:13.780]  ignored but now it's getting to the point where you have major stories that they literally will not
[02:15:13.780 --> 02:15:18.100]  cover actively refuse to cover they won't even talk about michelle obama or where she's going on
[02:15:18.100 --> 02:15:23.380]  vacation now right it's and people and more and more people are genuinely aware of this i mean you
[02:15:23.380 --> 02:15:27.780]  look at the comments and on any online news story or even a youtube video or anything like that
[02:15:28.340 --> 02:15:32.740]  you are really seeing this whole underground narrative that's spreading among the american
[02:15:32.740 --> 02:15:37.860]  people this does represent something genuinely new and genuinely exciting i agree you guys want to
[02:15:37.860 --> 02:15:44.900]  duck into the woods here oh really they don't even let you duck into those now oh whatever
[02:15:45.460 --> 02:15:52.260]  let's go over here to the one oh hey a tarp hey little water doesn't bother us but you're rolling
[02:15:52.260 --> 02:15:58.260]  over here but i mean think about the magnitude of the fact that the system bet the farm on the fact
[02:15:58.260 --> 02:16:02.340]  that there's no shadow grip there's no foreign banks they want to take over and now it's in the
[02:16:02.340 --> 02:16:06.820]  economist magazine we need technocrats that are unelected to run things they have unelected bankers
[02:16:06.820 --> 02:16:12.100]  running most the european countries now most the laws are now thank you guys you're awesome
[02:16:12.100 --> 02:16:18.100]  i don't mind some rain but it'll short our equipment all of this is happening and the the
[02:16:18.100 --> 02:16:23.700]  shroud is being pulled back okay oh yeah i agree i mean what they don't i've noticed since yesterday
[02:16:23.700 --> 02:16:27.460]  is that they've moved the barricades you can't even get up close to the uh to the entrance now
[02:16:27.460 --> 02:16:32.340]  tomorrow and you're expecting what 2 000 people a couple thousand people who knows most people
[02:16:32.340 --> 02:16:37.860]  say they can't come till friday night or saturday or sunday we got we have even with the uh right
[02:16:37.860 --> 02:16:42.020]  now for for people who are just listening it's uh thundering and lightning in a second now it's
[02:16:42.020 --> 02:16:47.220]  pouring rain but they're still easily double the people who are here yesterday 250 yesterday i got
[02:16:47.220 --> 02:16:52.820]  to say conservatively 500 and more walking up all the time right here folks be part of history
[02:16:52.820 --> 02:16:57.620]  and here's the thing to remember especially just looking at the headlines what's going on in europe
[02:16:57.620 --> 02:17:02.900]  is kind of a model for what is being planned for the united states right now people in europe can
[02:17:02.900 --> 02:17:08.020]  discuss openly people in britain talk about this all the time the fact that most of their laws are
[02:17:08.020 --> 02:17:14.340]  not made by 83 83 percent right and what you're seeing in what you saw in greece with the reaction
[02:17:14.340 --> 02:17:18.980]  to the voters there and the reaction of voters in other places is this kind of furious populist
[02:17:18.980 --> 02:17:23.460]  reaction to the idea that they're not even in charge of their own financial destiny anymore
[02:17:23.460 --> 02:17:28.180]  and that debate is coming here and it's a debate that can't be pushed away and the show that this
[02:17:28.180 --> 02:17:32.260]  isn't a conspiracy theory this is just the simple facts you just got a glance at the headlines of
[02:17:32.260 --> 02:17:36.500]  the wall street journal or the uh new york times about what's going on there or the economists for
[02:17:36.500 --> 02:17:41.540]  that matter this is a great a great parable of life all the patriots come together and in seconds
[02:17:41.540 --> 02:17:48.580]  we have a giant umbrella for everybody folks are awesome yeah and it's going up by our heat like a
[02:17:48.580 --> 02:17:53.780]  hot air balloon yeah i gotta say the crowd here this has the uh this has the atmosphere of a
[02:17:53.780 --> 02:17:58.980]  coach football tailgate it's exciting i mean this is history as you said elix and i guess everybody
[02:17:58.980 --> 02:18:03.620]  coming together it's not about left or right it's about liberty it's about freedom it's about
[02:18:04.180 --> 02:18:08.580]  controlling our own destiny and not being slaves it's about 1776
[02:18:11.700 --> 02:18:16.100]  i think elix populized a phrase and it's something needs to be said again and again and again
[02:18:16.100 --> 02:18:23.860]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 and never forget that and that's why they're afraid they are afraid
[02:18:23.860 --> 02:18:28.020]  they know i mean listen i got this from our source they just said yeah i heard them cussing ron paul
[02:18:28.020 --> 02:18:31.460]  and they get real mad when they come through and get bullhorned they you know the billard burgers
[02:18:31.460 --> 02:18:36.020]  just kind of oh that's ron paul people because they understand that's folks that are awake anti-globalist
[02:18:36.020 --> 02:18:41.540]  anti-new world order you know patriots old old line like constitutionalists but tuckers source
[02:18:41.540 --> 02:18:46.980]  the tuckers always impeccable said they were yesterday seconds after we bullhorned like a
[02:18:46.980 --> 02:18:50.820]  minute after they were yelling and going i want ron paul and all those people on a plane
[02:18:50.820 --> 02:18:56.020]  and i want to have a muslin extremist blow it up i mean that shows how upset bill deberg is they
[02:18:56.020 --> 02:19:02.100]  are angry what do you say to that one is one is tempted to remind people of larry mcdonald and
[02:19:02.100 --> 02:19:05.620]  say look they were talking about just the other day that's why i brought it up gel books about larry
[02:19:05.620 --> 02:19:11.540]  mcdonald well for those of you i don't like skip the break skip the break for those of you guys
[02:19:11.540 --> 02:19:16.260]  who don't know larry mcdonald was a former head of the john birch society a democratic congressman
[02:19:16.260 --> 02:19:21.300]  out of the south uh i think yeah i believe and he was the man who i believe ron paul said was his
[02:19:21.300 --> 02:19:25.700]  political role model when he got started yeah a real one the not even not even marry goldwater he
[02:19:25.700 --> 02:19:29.780]  was from cob county georgia which at that point was uh it used to be the most conserved place in
[02:19:29.780 --> 02:19:35.220]  america which uh newt gingrich ended up taking his seat the point is he was like
[02:19:35.220 --> 02:19:39.780]  he was kind of not going to tell the story well the main the main point is he uh the american
[02:19:39.780 --> 02:19:44.660]  conservative union rated him to this day still one of the top conservative voting congressman
[02:19:44.660 --> 02:19:50.500]  though he was a democrat and uh in 1983 he was going to a event down in south korea to commemorate
[02:19:50.500 --> 02:19:56.180]  the end of the korean war with jesse helms and oren hatch and they were on a plane uh a connecting
[02:19:56.180 --> 02:20:02.500]  flight in alaska for some reason senator hatch and senator um helms get off and take a later flight
[02:20:02.500 --> 02:20:08.740]  well congressman mcdonnell gets on the flight and it's shot down over russian aerospace
[02:20:08.740 --> 02:20:12.500]  the the initial media reports stated that it landed safely on saucalon islands
[02:20:13.060 --> 02:20:18.100]  day later it turns out everyone's dead there's no uh they have no um they have no wreckage they
[02:20:18.100 --> 02:20:24.660]  can't find anything it's lost its seat everberg likes to do it and so now they're like i want to
[02:20:24.660 --> 02:20:28.660]  put him in a supporters on a plane and claim a basically claim a muslim extremist blew it up
[02:20:28.660 --> 02:20:33.620]  yeah they don't have the so they don't have a soviet union anymore so now it'll be muslim extremists
[02:20:34.180 --> 02:20:40.260]  i think that the uh i think that you know when people talk about these kinds of things even they
[02:20:40.260 --> 02:20:45.460]  use this kind of rhetoric i mean this this distrust of the establishment this trust of the
[02:20:45.460 --> 02:20:51.300]  establishment of both parties i mean people's fear of dispossession economically politically you
[02:20:51.300 --> 02:20:55.700]  know the control the loss of control over their own lives you see more and more of this every
[02:20:55.700 --> 02:21:01.060]  single day and it is now getting to the point where people will no longer afford to be comfortable
[02:21:01.060 --> 02:21:04.980]  your jobs are being shipped overseas your jobs are being taken away from you your pensions are
[02:21:04.980 --> 02:21:10.980]  going to be taken away from our tax money pays to ship it overseas i mean the people who rule you
[02:21:10.980 --> 02:21:16.180]  hate you and you have to get that through your head the people who rule you absolutely despise
[02:21:16.180 --> 02:21:22.340]  you and they're they're very angry when they hear any kind of dissent whatsoever and so i don't
[02:21:22.340 --> 02:21:26.820]  really put anything past them yeah i mean they're talking about killing ron paul folks we could spend
[02:21:26.820 --> 02:21:31.620]  this as they're joking in there they are in cussing fits and and the people working in there
[02:21:31.620 --> 02:21:35.700]  because we got this right from the lobby area are that here are these world leaders just like
[02:21:36.740 --> 02:21:40.420]  really saying horrible things about ron paul and laughing about how they want to kill them and how
[02:21:40.420 --> 02:21:44.820]  they can do it this should be investigated but so should the logan actor in there violating
[02:21:44.820 --> 02:21:48.820]  anything else you wanted to add about that no i just want to say to everyone here keep keep doing a
[02:21:48.820 --> 02:21:52.580]  great job keep fighting for the truth that's all that matters in uh in this world is fighting for
[02:21:52.580 --> 02:21:58.580]  the truth and fighting for your posterity that's why back in 1776 uh you know our founding fathers
[02:21:58.580 --> 02:22:02.420]  signed that document that said they're fighting for their life liberty and their sacred honor
[02:22:02.420 --> 02:22:08.180]  and it was for their posterity and that's what we are guys so don't stop absolutely and go ahead
[02:22:08.180 --> 02:22:12.020]  the one thing i would say is you know people are talking about the logan act and all these other
[02:22:12.020 --> 02:22:17.300]  laws that they're breaking and everything else it's remarkable about how overt that it now is
[02:22:17.300 --> 02:22:21.380]  it's remarkable how they're not even bothering to conceal anything anymore and i think if you
[02:22:21.380 --> 02:22:25.860]  could take one thing away from all of this is the fact that the mask is off the agenda is there for
[02:22:25.860 --> 02:22:30.260]  all to see uh there's no disguising it anymore and so the only question is what are you going to do
[02:22:30.260 --> 02:22:35.380]  about it i agree with you and by the way i'm going to talk to the network real quick great job guys
[02:22:35.380 --> 02:22:41.220]  wmd.com i'm alex jones of info wars dot com here with my crew with the great folks with that

[02:34:12.020 --> 02:34:18.420]  uh donnell graham ceo the washington post vernon jordan the man who brought bill clinton
[02:34:19.060 --> 02:34:24.180]  to the billderberg group where they didn't discuss naphtha to bill clinton's knowledge
[02:34:24.980 --> 02:34:31.700]  gary kasparov the former chess champion and in speaking of gary kasparov we have an article
[02:34:31.700 --> 02:34:37.140]  written by heron dykes who's on the ground there shooting video he managed to find some time
[02:34:37.140 --> 02:34:43.140]  to write this great article gary kasparov billderberg hopes to checkmate russia and that went up just
[02:34:43.140 --> 02:34:49.460]  this morning on info wars dot com i i pulled it off a prison planet dot com there it is right
[02:34:49.460 --> 02:34:57.220]  there gary kasparov billderberg hopes to checkmate russia and so it's asking you know why do you
[02:34:57.220 --> 02:35:02.260]  think they would bring kasparov in there he's obviously a puppet later on down it says uh
[02:35:02.260 --> 02:35:08.100]  following kasparov's arrest after protesting back in 2007 vatem vladimir putin the target of the
[02:35:08.100 --> 02:35:14.820]  protest um the writer observed in an interview a time magazine why did mr kasparov when arrested
[02:35:14.820 --> 02:35:21.060]  speak out in english rather than russian when a politician works the crowd of other nations
[02:35:21.060 --> 02:35:25.780]  rather than the russian nation it tells you something clearly kasparov spoke english for the
[02:35:25.780 --> 02:35:30.900]  same reason he toured america media outlets in the name of his cause because he's quietly backed
[02:35:30.900 --> 02:35:37.460]  by little else in the u.s policy interest he is back backing his backing from within the russian
[02:35:37.460 --> 02:35:44.500]  population is minimal so there you go he's being groomed to be one of the next leaders of russia
[02:35:44.500 --> 02:35:50.180]  to go against vladimir putin we saw a few years ago dick cheney tried to institute an invasion
[02:35:50.180 --> 02:35:56.260]  of russia going through i believe it was georgia and a lot of people were saying there and russians
[02:35:56.260 --> 02:36:02.260]  are invading georgia remember when that came out that was crazy people don't know their geography
[02:36:02.260 --> 02:36:08.260]  because we've been dumbed down by our public school system by design by design it's not done
[02:36:08.260 --> 02:36:14.340]  on accident okay the reason they change up these new strategies but the same strategy is dog training
[02:36:14.340 --> 02:36:19.860]  it's to get you to obey it's to get you to stand in line it's to get you to follow orders it's to
[02:36:19.860 --> 02:36:25.620]  get you to see that there are superiors and there are underlings are we going back live to alex
[02:36:27.860 --> 02:36:35.220]  okay uh just let me know uh also out of pravda billderberg meeting 2012 everyone not invited
[02:36:35.220 --> 02:36:40.660]  near washington dc the billderberg meeting started thursday may 31st at shantilly virginia

[02:36:46.020 --> 02:36:50.420]  hotel a concerned citizen booked a room way in advance but was later kicked out from the merry
[02:36:50.420 --> 02:36:55.700]  hot marriott hotel in this video and then it says the mainstream media avoids but only a few
[02:36:55.700 --> 02:37:00.660]  brave souls like abby martin from rt alex jones from info wars dot com and the guardians charlie
[02:37:00.660 --> 02:37:07.540]  skelton are doing their best to report on the situation make sure you check their websites
[02:37:08.500 --> 02:37:13.460]  and videos for the latest news on the billderberg meeting and it goes on about who they are who
[02:37:13.460 --> 02:37:18.980]  they work for that's a pretty good article that we'll probably post soon on our website we're also
[02:37:18.980 --> 02:37:26.020]  going over the mitch daniels among secret four forums vip attendees and his press secretary
[02:37:26.020 --> 02:37:32.180]  actually said to uh the reporter who called it wasn't on his public schedule because it's not
[02:37:32.180 --> 02:37:36.580]  a public event here's the quote i'm going up to it right there no leave it right there go back to
[02:37:36.580 --> 02:37:44.340]  that it's very important i think we have alex jones on audio we're about to go back to um

[02:37:51.220 --> 02:37:56.740]  in a panel discussion today and leave it wasn't on his public schedule because it's not a public
[02:37:56.740 --> 02:38:02.660]  event okay that is the way they treat you they want to keep it in the dark they want to keep you in
[02:38:02.660 --> 02:38:09.460]  the dark while they continue to pull the strings to make kings to break kings to influence foreign
[02:38:09.460 --> 02:38:16.260]  and domestic policy all right i believe we are about to go back to alex jones all right here
[02:38:16.260 --> 02:38:23.220]  we go to alex again total experimental media as we blow bilgerberg and the shadow criminal
[02:38:23.220 --> 02:38:28.740]  offshore government the usurpers the invaders the foreign enemies that have hijacked our country
[02:38:28.740 --> 02:38:33.300]  that are telling us the un and nato run our military that are telling us that they'll secretly
[02:38:33.300 --> 02:38:38.980]  arrest us and disappear us this is the ultra massive magnitude off the charts but i just started
[02:38:38.980 --> 02:38:45.940]  noticing something all around this hotel in shantilly the police have engaged in crimes
[02:38:45.940 --> 02:38:50.100]  and if i had the time i would definitely try to prosecute them the problem is we've got a tyranny
[02:38:50.100 --> 02:38:53.700]  so they've got corrupt people above them but i'm going to go to the police station and file a formal
[02:38:53.700 --> 02:39:01.060]  complaint about this we have video of them going in and and pulling over the the shuttle lady and
[02:39:01.060 --> 02:39:05.780]  basically just saying don't drive anywhere around it then acting like they just said you go to legal
[02:39:05.780 --> 02:39:12.260]  areas and i said what are legal areas and he said i'm not going to tell you basically here it is
[02:39:12.260 --> 02:39:20.660]  this is the shuttle and bus and also taxi pickup here at the hotel and it's on different sides of
[02:39:20.660 --> 02:39:27.460]  the hotel and i have seen them pull people over right here where this is a drop-off point we built
[02:39:27.460 --> 02:39:33.620]  these roads we supposedly own this country and look at that i mean that is worse than the type of
[02:39:33.620 --> 02:39:37.620]  stuff we've seen at other demonstrations that's like telling black people get at the back of the
[02:39:37.620 --> 02:39:43.860]  bus i mean look at this rob jackson i just realized i've seen buses and stuff pull up here this is
[02:39:43.860 --> 02:39:56.420]  where taxis come you're supposed to be able to stop and then they've got pull ins down there for buses
[02:39:56.420 --> 02:40:02.100]  and cabs and they tell cabs they can't stop well they violate federal law out there look at this
