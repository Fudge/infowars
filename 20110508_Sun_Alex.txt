[01:01.720 --> 01:07.840]  psychological warfare programs that are currently used today and he's clearly
[01:07.840 --> 01:12.640]  looked at this latest bin Laden killing and and said you can see all the scripting
[01:12.640 --> 01:19.240]  the scythe but he can confirm that he was dead pre 2002 as he did on the air in
[01:19.240 --> 01:27.760]  April 2002 with us we're gonna break down from a former black cop you master
[01:27.760 --> 01:33.440]  mind exactly what is going on here and again recapping why they've done this

[02:05.200 --> 02:08.760]  back I'm going to go over some of his bio and this article just so people know
[02:08.760 --> 02:13.360]  exactly who they're listening to and then also he's been in so many missions
[02:13.360 --> 02:18.960]  involved in so many things he is the character that Jack Ryan in the Patriot
[02:18.960 --> 02:25.320]  Games series is based on he have and that's on record he's co-authored many
[02:25.320 --> 02:31.520]  of the books with Tom Clancy he's also you go to IMDB the producer on films
[02:31.520 --> 02:36.160]  like net force and others I mean just incredible and nobody knows what he looks
[02:36.160 --> 02:40.640]  like and he's here with us today because he wants you to know the truth I
[02:40.640 --> 02:46.840]  hope people realize the magnitude of this and obviously we'll let things
[02:46.840 --> 02:52.120]  settle out and he can do it come back on with us again next week as things
[02:52.120 --> 02:58.760]  continue to unfold so we're gonna be breaking all of that down today he of
[02:58.760 --> 03:05.080]  course is a board examiner level psychiatrist ran many large mental
[03:05.080 --> 03:10.640]  institutions also worked under five presidents three state departments and
[03:10.640 --> 03:15.200]  just involved in innumerable secret and clandestine operations maybe I should
[03:15.200 --> 03:18.360]  get him out of the gauge to tell us about some other stuff that he can now
[03:18.360 --> 03:24.960]  talk about just so people know how how important this information is and the
[03:24.960 --> 03:30.000]  fact that he's risking a lot coming on air and saying that he talked to a top
[03:30.000 --> 03:34.400]  US general who could confirm 9-11 was an inside job and he's ready to testify
[03:34.400 --> 03:41.240]  before a federal or state grand jury right now this is big news he's not
[03:41.240 --> 03:47.280]  playing games and this is the real deal but as he pointed out yesterday he's not
[03:47.280 --> 03:51.720]  really risking anything because if we don't turn this around folks there is no
[03:51.720 --> 03:55.880]  society there is no future I mean every time I look at my dear little children
[03:55.880 --> 04:00.240]  how sweet and innocent and good they are and there's always corruption there's
[04:00.240 --> 04:03.960]  always problems but when you stop resisting it when you just give into
[04:03.960 --> 04:09.840]  it when you let total delusion rule the day it infects all of society then total
[04:09.840 --> 04:15.200]  confidence is lost and you become a banana Republic and we are on our way to
[04:15.200 --> 04:21.200]  that right now and the controllers try to sell us on how much they want to
[04:21.200 --> 04:28.160]  protect us our the the meme they're pushing right now is that the government's
[04:28.160 --> 04:32.320]  job is to protect you and that's the most important I heard them on the radio
[04:32.320 --> 04:36.680]  and TV is saying don't worry about gas prices or about the dollar plunging it's
[04:36.680 --> 04:41.400]  national security keep us safe well what's most important is the Bill of
[04:41.400 --> 04:45.240]  Rights Constitution Declaration of Independence the free market private
[04:45.240 --> 04:49.920]  property the family that's the engine that the limited government is supposed
[04:49.920 --> 04:54.480]  to protect not protect me by having checkpoints on the highways everywhere

[07:10.040 --> 07:14.240]  you can go to IMDB and see that he's listed his ex-producer executive
[07:14.240 --> 07:19.520]  producer on many of those big films and it's a Steve Pachennick dot-com we're
[07:19.520 --> 07:24.880]  not going to show you his photo his photo is not known I mean he was a really
[07:24.880 --> 07:29.680]  interesting type psychiatrist a lot of times you find those type of guys right
[07:29.680 --> 07:33.720]  up at the top of black ops psychological warfare I did more research on
[07:33.720 --> 07:36.720]  him I mean any who he was nine plus years ago when I interviewed him and it
[07:36.720 --> 07:41.520]  really blew me away how much he doesn't chewed his horn in fact looking around
[07:41.520 --> 07:45.120]  here in my stack I'm looking for my London Telegraph article US Envoy
[07:45.120 --> 07:52.640]  admits role in Aldo Moro killing and the former Italian Prime Minister and
[07:52.640 --> 07:59.560]  overthrowing governments I mean he is Jack Ryan and then some that character
[07:59.560 --> 08:02.960]  that's all we've got Harrison Ford's image image up there is Jack Ryan today
[08:02.960 --> 08:09.160]  since we don't have a photo of them of a Dr. Pachennick and I mean I got to say
[08:09.160 --> 08:13.480]  at certain levels you know they they they make it mythical the Navy SEALs and
[08:13.480 --> 08:18.080]  the Delta Force all that stuff I mean this guy people like to get scared of
[08:18.080 --> 08:22.480]  those types a lot of really be creeped out in a way by by just how much this
[08:22.480 --> 08:27.680]  guy knows where he's been he's a scary guy and I know he's gonna probably laugh
[08:27.680 --> 08:34.280]  at that in a minute but the point is you know putting out disinfo I'm gonna see
[08:34.280 --> 08:37.120]  this is true for the so the Redberg games will go ahead and kill him because
[08:37.120 --> 08:41.480]  they thought it would destabilize Italy if they didn't I mean just wild I mean
[08:41.480 --> 08:47.720]  it goes on and on for the Pentagon setting up the modern black op program
[08:47.720 --> 08:54.400]  that's run today this is the ultimate guy to get on to analyze the black op we
[08:54.400 --> 09:00.240]  saw Sunday the disinfo the cartoon cartoonishness of it he comes on air and
[09:00.240 --> 09:05.840]  tells us that yes 9-11's an inside job is ready to testify to a federal or
[09:05.840 --> 09:10.240]  state grand jury on the top general at the time that was in the military that
[09:10.240 --> 09:14.760]  yes it was an inside job they stood down it was a black op of course I've got the
[09:14.760 --> 09:17.880]  local footage of the police saying get back they're gonna blow up building 7
[09:17.880 --> 09:22.120]  and the firefighters about the molten steel and the blast charges going off
[09:22.120 --> 09:27.000]  the freefall I mean the NORAD stand down the Cheney order I mean people say
[09:27.000 --> 09:32.920]  where's the evidence there's too much evidence it hides in plain view but we're
[09:32.920 --> 09:37.320]  seeing record Facebook accounts being deleted my space people being knocked
[09:37.320 --> 09:41.920]  off major news site comments where they normally allowed to send the system is
[09:41.920 --> 09:46.920]  scared to death right now and I could officially tell you this blew up in their
[09:46.920 --> 09:54.320]  face now I want to go to dr. Pachinic here in just a moment because he doesn't
[09:54.320 --> 09:57.360]  want to chew his horn but I mean if he could just people don't have serious
[09:57.360 --> 10:01.320]  because you can just Google his name I spent over an hour last night just in
[10:01.320 --> 10:05.760]  the government overthrows the black ops the running the Taliban against the
[10:05.760 --> 10:12.640]  Russians the just I mean just you name it this guy makes eHoward Hunt look like
[10:12.640 --> 10:18.960]  a schoolboy all the stuff he was involved in and it goes on and of course
[10:18.960 --> 10:22.200]  Ethan Hunt that's the name of the guy mission impossible they admit that's
[10:22.200 --> 10:27.240]  the character of eHoward Hunt we got the deathbed confession here first of them
[10:27.240 --> 10:31.200]  pulling the trigger on JFK top US government insider bin Laden died in
[10:31.200 --> 10:37.440]  2001 911 a false flag top US government insider dr. Steve Pachinic a man who
[10:37.440 --> 10:41.640]  held numerous different influential post under five different presidents but
[10:41.640 --> 10:45.320]  under the Secretary of State under three still works for the Defense Department

[10:53.240 --> 10:58.160]  top general told him directly that 911 was a false flag inside job I mean this
[10:58.160 --> 11:02.040]  is the kind of stuff can get us killed folks Pachinic cannot be dismissed as a
[11:02.040 --> 11:05.160]  conspiracy theorist he served as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State of
[11:05.160 --> 11:08.920]  the three administrations Nixon Ford Carter while working under Reagan and
[11:08.920 --> 11:12.280]  Bush senior and still works as a consultant for the Department of Defense
[11:12.280 --> 11:18.080]  a former US Navy captain when as high as Colonel I believe before he got out
[11:18.080 --> 11:22.400]  Pachinic achieved two prestigious Harry C Solomon awards at the Harvard School
[11:22.400 --> 11:28.000]  as he simultaneously completed his PhD at MIT recruited by Lawrence Eagle
[11:28.000 --> 11:33.280]  Burger as Deputy Assistant Secretary for State Management Pachinic went on to
[11:33.280 --> 11:36.360]  develop the basic tenets of psychological warfare this is from the
[11:36.360 --> 11:40.520]  Pentagon the basic modern tenets of psychological warfare counterterrorism
[11:40.520 --> 11:45.520]  strategy and tactics for transcultural negotiations that's the anthropology
[11:45.520 --> 11:50.640]  sociology for the US Department of State military and intelligence
[11:50.640 --> 11:53.720]  communities other agencies the US government while also developing a
[11:53.720 --> 11:58.280]  foundational strategies for hostage rescue that were later employed around
[11:58.280 --> 12:02.480]  the world Pachinic also served a senior policy planner under Secretaries
[12:02.480 --> 12:07.600]  Henry Kissinger senior policy planner Cyrus Vance George Shultz these are the
[12:07.600 --> 12:11.760]  top king makers James Baker and worked for George W Bush's reelection campaign
[12:11.760 --> 12:15.520]  against Al Gore is his record underscores the fact that he is one of the
[12:15.520 --> 12:18.600]  most deeply connected men in intelligence circles over the past three
[12:18.600 --> 12:23.640]  decades he's Jack Ryan folks it just goes on and on this is insane and
[12:23.640 --> 12:28.560]  everything he says fits into my research and all the other experts I'm
[12:28.560 --> 12:32.280]  talking to Hamed Ghouls agreeing former head of Pakistani intelligence general
[12:32.280 --> 12:38.800]  ghoul Webster Tarpley Wayne Madsen NSA but it I know I'm ranting sir I
[12:38.800 --> 12:43.000]  apologize just just I want to get into some of the other issues you wanted to
[12:43.000 --> 12:47.080]  cover today but since we talked 24 hours ago or 22 hours ago to be technical
[12:47.080 --> 12:52.520]  this is clearly blowing up in their face do you agree and how dangerous are
[12:52.520 --> 12:58.960]  these cornered rats now well I think you know when you tell a lie you're going to
[12:58.960 --> 13:04.880]  unwind that lie by the very fact that you can create it alive the nature of
[13:04.880 --> 13:09.280]  creating a lion's psychological warfare is that you have to be consistent make
[13:09.280 --> 13:13.800]  sure that all the details are intertwined and are credible it's almost like a
[13:13.800 --> 13:16.920]  movie so you got to think of the president of the United States the
[13:16.920 --> 13:20.800]  chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mullen who by the way his father was a
[13:20.800 --> 13:25.000]  publicist for the William Morris agency and in the intelligence community it's
[13:25.000 --> 13:29.840]  not an accident that you have this entirely contrived story it's not
[13:29.840 --> 13:34.720]  credible it's just like you had Disneyland with a key character who was
[13:34.720 --> 13:40.000]  already dead and in order to reaffirm the storyline that is to make sure that
[13:40.000 --> 13:44.320]  the president of the United States look good a man like Axel Ryder all his
[13:44.320 --> 13:48.760]  advisors including Obama's wealth was particularly suited to the lie
[13:48.760 --> 13:52.840]  distortions and deception because that's how he came to power that's how a
[13:52.840 --> 13:57.880]  George Bush Jr. comes to power he sits down with a bunch of his own cronies
[13:57.880 --> 14:01.640]  they sit down in group faith which you talked about before on your radio
[14:01.640 --> 14:06.600]  every one of the national security advisors who have their roles there
[14:06.600 --> 14:10.200]  because they're between in the sycophants to the president they're all
[14:10.200 --> 14:14.760]  tout-towing down come together and create this fictional story in
[14:14.760 --> 14:19.200]  psychological warfare that makes no sense and many of the present people in
[14:19.200 --> 14:23.160]  psychological warfare were never trained 20 30 years ago because they didn't
[14:23.160 --> 14:26.480]  understand the psychology they understand the anthropology they don't
[14:26.480 --> 14:30.920]  understand that the American public you do not sigh up to the American public
[14:30.920 --> 14:35.080]  that was a rule of thumb that we had under four to five presidents that if
[14:35.080 --> 14:39.440]  you tried to sigh up to the American public and it broke when you had George
[14:39.440 --> 14:43.960]  Bush Jr. when he created the psychological warfare and then created the
[14:43.960 --> 14:49.680]  9-11 through deception distortion false flag stand down and then we had before
[14:49.680 --> 14:53.080]  him we had Lyndon Bain Johnson it goes on both sides when he created the
[14:53.080 --> 14:56.920]  distortion of a false flag in the Gulf of Pump King we went into the war in
[14:56.920 --> 15:03.600]  Vietnam and we had FDR as Donald Rundsfeld stupidly accused and said that
[15:03.600 --> 15:07.600]  if anybody like the kennec is accusing the republicans of creating 9-11
[15:07.600 --> 15:14.320]  Rundsfeld said it's on public September 12th 9 on 2011 he said at 2001 he said
[15:14.320 --> 15:19.000]  steep the kennec if he accuses us republicans of 9-11 then we have to
[15:19.000 --> 15:23.560]  accuse Franklin Roosevelt of doing a standout well of course I accused them
[15:23.560 --> 15:27.040]  of doing a standout because Paul Wolfe with the neocon salmé
[15:27.040 --> 15:34.720]  holla's odd Frank Fukuyama you had Dennis Ross you had Richard Pearl and
[15:34.720 --> 15:38.700]  you had Scooter Lippy all trained at the University of Chicago under Wolf
[15:38.700 --> 15:43.280]  Stetter and what was your topic stay down in the false flag and Pearl Harbor
[15:43.280 --> 15:47.280]  the University of Chicago when I was at MIT
[15:59.160 --> 16:03.040]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[16:03.040 --> 16:07.440]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[16:07.440 --> 16:11.600]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[16:11.600 --> 16:15.640]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[16:15.640 --> 16:19.480]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[16:19.480 --> 16:23.760]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[16:23.760 --> 16:27.920]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[16:27.920 --> 16:32.240]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[16:32.240 --> 16:35.960]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[16:35.960 --> 16:40.160]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[16:40.160 --> 16:43.520]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution

[20:00.320 --> 20:06.320]  coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones
[20:06.320 --> 20:15.960]  broadcasting network network I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal
[20:15.960 --> 20:22.920]  hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man Thomas Jefferson
[20:22.920 --> 20:40.760]  it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[20:40.760 --> 20:45.520]  so what happens now what happens now when you distorted the story and you can't
[20:45.520 --> 20:49.960]  get a consistency just as we saw in George Bush Jr which was well we have
[20:49.960 --> 20:53.320]  weapons of mass destruction suddenly there's a reality testing the reason
[20:53.320 --> 20:58.080]  weapons mass destruction then suddenly the military are formidable military
[20:58.080 --> 21:03.320]  our generals and our military generals in particular are forced to change the
[21:03.320 --> 21:07.720]  intelligence in order to go be consistent with the White House but thank
[21:07.720 --> 21:11.920]  God for a lot of our CIA operatives who were not on contract who would be in
[21:11.920 --> 21:17.240]  career and refused to listen to Bush Jr and to the bullying of Cheney but today
[21:17.240 --> 21:23.480]  unfortunately 80% of our CIA now are mercenaries they do not have analysis
[21:23.480 --> 21:28.760]  intel they really detailed off from special forces and sir that's what I
[21:28.760 --> 21:31.960]  want to stop you doctor and continue but that's what Ray McGovern I don't know
[21:31.960 --> 21:36.680]  if you knew him but he was you know the morning briefer for Reagan and and and
[21:36.680 --> 21:42.800]  Bush senior did you know him you know I knew well well race is the same thing
[21:42.800 --> 21:47.280]  he says they can't even do real national security assessments anymore
[21:47.280 --> 21:52.400]  because it's all a long land and once you put a Psyop out into the public the
[21:52.400 --> 21:55.760]  way the human brain works and all individuals being limited in their
[21:55.760 --> 22:00.720]  perception it then is taken back and received by your own system and it
[22:00.720 --> 22:05.600]  basically for lack of a better word makes the military industrial complex
[22:05.600 --> 22:10.160]  drink their own Kool-Aid well it's not only the military industrial by the way
[22:10.160 --> 22:14.040]  it's very important for the public to understand this I am not a hero I'm not
[22:14.040 --> 22:17.840]  this great individual I'm just a simple American who was grateful for the
[22:17.840 --> 22:23.000]  benefits I was given and earned in terms of the ability to serve my country and
[22:23.000 --> 22:27.000]  at the same time being the only country where I could criticize my own president
[22:27.000 --> 22:31.120]  and still work for them and be so loyal to my country because I was willing to
[22:31.120 --> 22:35.480]  go online and particularly serve my military our army generals in particular
[22:35.480 --> 22:39.200]  the army colonels and be teaching at the war college every year that's a
[22:39.200 --> 22:43.680]  privilege for me I don't understand dr. Botanics Alex but I have to understand
[22:43.680 --> 22:48.120]  the public this is I'm not some superhero I'm the same guy that your father is
[22:48.120 --> 22:54.480]  who's a dentist or a mechanic out there or an army lieutenant or or a junior
[22:54.480 --> 22:59.560]  officer because they stood for something they believed in I am tired of the
[22:59.560 --> 23:04.240]  American public being told these lies I thought it would stop with 9-11 now we
[23:04.240 --> 23:08.240]  have Obama now let's get back to the issue what happens when the Psyops which
[23:08.240 --> 23:13.160]  was poorly constructed you were talking about where they get their CIA people and
[23:13.160 --> 23:17.360]  that mostly intelligence is run by private mercs correct they get the
[23:17.360 --> 23:21.400]  intelligence people from all the military industrial complex l3
[23:21.400 --> 23:26.640]  communication north of Grumman any of these companies around the Washington
[23:26.640 --> 23:31.160]  Beltway will provide intelligence to you right away because they want those
[23:31.160 --> 23:35.400]  contracts now remember America at particularly the Alex Jones audience
[23:35.400 --> 23:39.960]  supporting our national security does not mean supporting our military
[23:39.960 --> 23:45.040]  industrial complex it is not the same thing they are out of control they have
[23:45.040 --> 23:49.440]  been hogs that need to be slaughtered I will quote one of my most favorite
[23:49.440 --> 23:53.960]  presidents one fortune I was too young to serve but I did always admire him and
[23:53.960 --> 23:58.800]  that was general Eisenhower who warned us when he left beware of the military
[23:58.800 --> 24:03.520]  industrial complex he repeatedly said that this is a great man who was
[24:03.520 --> 24:09.040]  exceedingly modest who was exceedingly careful of the American national
[24:09.040 --> 24:13.600]  security and every week he literally Alex would call up the Pentagon to make
[24:13.600 --> 24:19.280]  sure the generals didn't blow out their staff or promote things and create
[24:19.280 --> 24:25.000]  units that didn't exist that's the type of generals we had and people who cared
[24:25.000 --> 24:29.880]  about a country we don't have that now what we have is Disneyland on steroids
[24:29.880 --> 24:35.000]  and what's worth is that Disneyland is killing our American our heroes our
[24:35.000 --> 24:40.680]  American women and men and young people who are going out to die for civilian
[24:40.680 --> 24:44.880]  orders that are being used and manipulated by a president who's never
[24:44.880 --> 24:49.640]  served our country has a questionable background in many many places to get the
[24:49.640 --> 24:54.520]  birthing issue and has civilians around them have an open questionable in their
[24:54.520 --> 24:59.400]  capability and we're all recruited from a questionable predecessor either
[24:59.400 --> 25:05.520]  Carter or Clinton who himself was also a sociopath so we have three sociopaths
[25:05.520 --> 25:10.400]  in line and I use it not in a diagnostic term but in a very simple term you have
[25:10.400 --> 25:15.000]  Clinton who lied and pervericated you have Bush Jr. who lied and pervericated
[25:15.000 --> 25:20.120]  and now you have Obama now if we have three in the law we got a problem here
[25:20.120 --> 25:24.080]  America this problem isn't just with the individual of the Republican and
[25:24.080 --> 25:28.520]  Democrat this problem is with the American people we have to decide this
[25:28.520 --> 25:33.400]  is enough whether you're a Republican Democrat liberal or conservative it's
[25:33.400 --> 25:37.440]  irrelevant sir let me stop you because Alex Jones absolutely because we have
[25:37.440 --> 25:40.480]  limited time and obviously you're gonna be back with us a lot what happened
[25:40.480 --> 25:46.640]  with see what the issue now what happened is if I didn't know which unit of the
[25:46.640 --> 25:50.960]  special forces and I've worked with special forces over 30 years and part of
[25:50.960 --> 25:55.360]  it I was involved in and development of Delta Force because in the beginning of
[25:55.360 --> 26:00.480]  hostage negotiation we didn't have a comparable unit to the FAS one of the
[26:00.480 --> 26:04.200]  concerns that I had and I said if I think any unit is going to be sent in
[26:04.200 --> 26:07.840]  there on but on the basis of publicity and believe me I have a lot of respect
[26:07.840 --> 26:11.800]  for the men and women who serve in the Navy and in all special forces but
[26:11.800 --> 26:15.960]  particularly I work with the military army and the special forces which by the
[26:15.960 --> 26:19.760]  way you have never heard anything about you have never heard about any of the
[26:19.760 --> 26:24.360]  army men who I know and the units that I specifically know no will I tell you
[26:24.360 --> 26:28.600]  of the men and women who are in the army and they're serving this country and
[26:28.600 --> 26:32.680]  they've never had a movie about them they've never had a story about them
[26:32.680 --> 26:36.920]  yet today I would have sworn in I said to Alex Jones beforehand if I had a
[26:36.920 --> 26:41.280]  predict which unit was going to get the biggest publicity and if I were Admiral
[26:41.280 --> 26:45.400]  Mullen who's in concerned about this publicity and the publicity of the Navy
[26:45.400 --> 26:50.000]  because they have no goal whatsoever right now strategically I would have said
[26:50.000 --> 26:54.200]  they were to use the Seal Navy team now think about it you use a seal Navy team
[26:54.200 --> 27:00.000]  on the ground from pack Afghanistan to Pakistan it makes no sense and then to
[27:00.000 --> 27:04.840]  go on the news and to say that we are so great but we are so secret it is an
[27:04.840 --> 27:09.440]  inherent contradiction when you're secret you are secret there's a reason
[27:09.440 --> 27:13.000]  why I don't have a picture because I'm not that good-looking there's a reason
[27:13.000 --> 27:17.680]  I really don't care about what people think about it because I want to do my
[27:17.680 --> 27:21.960]  everyday life in America I don't need to promote my narcissism I don't need to
[27:21.960 --> 27:26.160]  promote who I am or what I am it's already difficult to pronounce my last
[27:26.160 --> 27:30.920]  name Pachanik and by the way that's been my secret to success overseas because
[27:30.920 --> 27:35.400]  nobody could spell Pachanik including Noriega but let's go back to the Navy
[27:35.400 --> 27:39.920]  Seals they really have to question what they did and what happened well let me
[27:39.920 --> 27:44.120]  stop you doctor a doctor there's been some major breaking news Dr. Pachanik
[27:44.120 --> 27:48.880]  are you there okay okay great obviously this morning they came out and said his
[27:48.880 --> 27:53.640]  daughter they have at a military base in Pakistan who was left there and he has
[27:53.640 --> 27:57.960]  all these wives all these concubines all this made up cut out just like they
[27:57.960 --> 28:01.360]  told us that you know Pat Tillman was killed fighting Al Qaeda and turned out
[28:01.360 --> 28:05.040]  they just murdered him or the same thing with private Lynch with Brachheimer on
[28:05.040 --> 28:09.720]  record producing it if folks don't know about that BBC admits it they're now
[28:09.720 --> 28:14.000]  announcing that oh not only did bin Laden not use his wife as a shield not
[28:14.000 --> 28:21.400]  only did he not shoot at them now they grabbed him took him out and then shot
[28:21.400 --> 28:26.480]  him somewhere else and they just keep changing it changing it changing and
[28:26.480 --> 28:30.360]  then the SEAL team six as you know is the most secret of the teams and has
[28:30.360 --> 28:35.720]  other teams associated with it that's why they use that team so that other
[28:35.720 --> 28:42.840]  SEALs are are ignorant and and and can never you know discover that it didn't
[28:42.840 --> 28:48.320]  happen and and you you're breaking down what teams you think are involved what
[28:48.320 --> 28:54.160]  happened obviously it's theater he's been dead for nine plus years ten years
[29:00.720 --> 29:05.640]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[29:05.640 --> 29:11.160]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that
[29:11.160 --> 29:14.880]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned in this
[29:14.880 --> 29:19.960]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[29:19.960 --> 29:25.320]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[29:25.320 --> 29:30.240]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[29:30.240 --> 29:34.640]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[29:34.640 --> 29:38.360]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more
[29:38.360 --> 29:42.280]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the check out to today seems
[29:42.280 --> 29:47.840]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of
[29:47.840 --> 29:53.520]  the Republic yet your copy of full of the Republic on DVD at info wars dot com
[29:53.520 --> 30:00.280]  we're watching online right now in super high quality at prison planet TV this is

[30:03.640 --> 30:07.920]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple
[30:07.920 --> 30:12.080]  your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much
[30:12.080 --> 30:16.160]  power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[30:16.160 --> 30:20.520]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[30:20.520 --> 30:24.600]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[30:24.600 --> 30:29.160]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[30:29.160 --> 30:33.280]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[30:33.280 --> 30:37.280]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[30:37.280 --> 30:41.040]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I

[33:33.760 --> 33:53.840]  Dr. Steve Pachinick is our guest and he's breaking down as a PsyOps expert who
[33:53.840 --> 33:57.280]  really wrote the book on much the modern system that this is completely
[33:57.280 --> 34:00.920]  phoning and I know that he just laughed at it he's on record nine years ago
[34:00.920 --> 34:05.440]  here saying Ben Lavazone eyes would be rolled out then the former Secretary of
[34:05.440 --> 34:08.800]  State Madeline Albright came out and said indeed that was true to resigns
[34:08.800 --> 34:13.880]  Kerry Walter Cronkite big insider and people get confused they say well this
[34:13.880 --> 34:17.680]  is a new administration why would Bush let him do that later a no one would
[34:17.680 --> 34:21.800]  believe it because it was exposed beforehand B they wanted to keep that
[34:21.800 --> 34:28.280]  boogeyman alive a while now that he's not useful anymore by killing him in the
[34:28.280 --> 34:35.440]  fairyland in the land of nod or the you know the land that Tinkerbell lives in
[34:35.440 --> 34:43.760]  by doing that now they revive him and say oh my gosh look the terrorists are
[34:43.760 --> 34:47.520]  now everywhere they're going to be attacking us we've got to set up TSA
[34:47.520 --> 34:52.800]  train checkpoints in all malls grocery stores that CBS news today we've got to
[34:52.800 --> 34:56.480]  take all your rights and have more wars you've got to do whatever we tell you
[34:56.480 --> 35:01.200]  because bin Laden is dead and of course we wrote about this yesterday forget
[35:01.200 --> 35:06.320]  Pakistan US new bin Laden's location all along if you believe the official story
[35:06.320 --> 35:09.560]  in the Pakistanis are now saying nine months ago they said something was
[35:09.560 --> 35:13.960]  going on in that compound but again that's all just adding credence to the
[35:13.960 --> 35:18.480]  official story and and all these debates about did he have a gun did he use his
[35:18.480 --> 35:22.840]  wife was he shot at the compound did they execute him later that's all to
[35:22.840 --> 35:27.480]  create inconsistencies in the fake narrative because somehow it lends
[35:27.480 --> 35:31.360]  credibility to it because then people say well they did kill him but we're
[35:31.360 --> 35:36.160]  being lied to about exactly how and the burial at sea which they say is the
[35:36.160 --> 35:40.240]  Sharia law and then it's the opposite of opposite of Sharia law then it makes
[35:40.240 --> 35:43.640]  it about did they follow Sharia law instead of why did they throw him in
[35:43.640 --> 35:49.240]  the ocean to get rid of him all of it completely manufactured so sir as a you
[35:49.240 --> 35:56.320]  know one of the top no psi op experts out there on record doctor breakdown not
[35:56.320 --> 35:59.440]  just the fact that you know it's a lie because you're inside sources and being
[35:59.440 --> 36:04.240]  on record but looking at the official fable I mean I think you said it best
[36:04.240 --> 36:08.880]  the seals are the politicized special forces group then there's Delta that you
[36:08.880 --> 36:12.520]  helped found and during the break you said yes you're correct but I can't
[36:12.520 --> 36:16.640]  talk about it but obviously through my contacts there are a whole bunch of
[36:16.640 --> 36:21.000]  other squadrons with other jobs not just anti-terror the surveillance groups the
[36:21.000 --> 36:25.040]  plainclothes groups I mean there's all sorts of groups way above that but you
[36:25.040 --> 36:29.320]  can't get into that but obviously they use the politicized group with this
[36:29.320 --> 36:34.320]  phantom seal team six so the other seals can't even find out it's a fraud
[36:34.320 --> 36:39.120]  please continue well the real issue again in the narrative that you want to
[36:39.120 --> 36:44.400]  create insides when you create a war like 9-11 which deception denial false
[36:44.400 --> 36:49.120]  flag and stand out at all your people know about your need to have a bad guy
[36:49.120 --> 36:54.120]  so the bad guy would suddenly sit down Osama bin Laden but in this narrative
[36:54.120 --> 36:59.280]  because Bush, Cheney, Wolfe with and the other neocons were not very bright and
[36:59.280 --> 37:04.680]  understanding even psi-ups for war they created two bad guys Saddam Hussein and
[37:04.680 --> 37:09.120]  Osama bin Laden and a lot of us got confused because Osama bin Laden Saddam
[37:09.120 --> 37:14.120]  Hussein has never been a Muslim he was basically a Baptist he hated Osama
[37:14.120 --> 37:20.720]  bin Laden and basically we had two wars going on with two on a specified
[37:20.720 --> 37:25.200]  targets we went into two countries without any clear exposition of what
[37:25.200 --> 37:29.760]  the reasons were so we had this incredible psi-ups who made no sense no
[37:29.760 --> 37:33.920]  internal consistency when people in the intelligence community came back to
[37:33.920 --> 37:37.360]  Bush and said this is not true we don't have weapons of mass destruction the
[37:37.360 --> 37:42.920]  still the only fable that was out there to sustain this myth of the war of why
[37:42.920 --> 37:47.520]  we were fighting terrorists that didn't exist and we had created under the Carter
[37:47.520 --> 37:51.240]  administration and subsequently in the Bush's administration we had to have
[37:51.240 --> 37:56.240]  this phantom pull of Osama bin Laden who was somehow scurrying about in the
[37:56.240 --> 38:02.360]  accident Toribora with a with a real dialysis machine and I said ten years
[38:02.360 --> 38:07.600]  ago on Alex Jones' show this is nonsense this psi-up is so pathetic
[38:07.600 --> 38:14.000]  because he has Marfan syndrome he died already six months after the 9-11
[38:14.000 --> 38:18.240]  attack he was has thought this is why here he is number two man is headed at
[38:18.240 --> 38:22.640]  Taliban is a provision and by the way from a tactical point of view and a
[38:22.640 --> 38:27.320]  strategic point of view his death means absolutely nothing in the real world of
[38:27.320 --> 38:31.800]  intelligence stop you the pain is that Obama is trying to resurrect his
[38:31.800 --> 38:35.880]  career and trying to get reelected and it means that Panetta wants to have
[38:35.880 --> 38:39.240]  credibility that he did something in the CIA when in fact he had was a
[38:39.240 --> 38:43.920]  disaster to see I he killed more civilians in Pakistan than any terrorist
[38:43.920 --> 38:49.120]  at he created more drone attacks than a terrorist we had more CIA operatives die
[38:49.120 --> 38:54.280]  because of his faulty understanding and we converted an entire CIA which is an
[38:54.280 --> 39:00.200]  intelligence or human oriented into special forces and into a killing unit
[39:00.200 --> 39:05.040]  now this does not involve the generals betray us and our military men who've
[39:05.040 --> 39:09.720]  done a formidable job but they are also at the behest of civilians who've never
[39:09.720 --> 39:14.120]  been to war so when the president of the United States Obama said without any
[39:14.120 --> 39:18.600]  experience after picking up the Nobel Peace Prize which was absurd and then
[39:18.600 --> 39:22.280]  went to war the next day in Afghanistan after giving this peace talk to the
[39:22.280 --> 39:25.800]  Muslims saying we're all brothers you could see the inconsistency in the lies
[39:25.800 --> 39:30.760]  and now this politicized drama which makes no sense all the inconsistencies
[39:30.760 --> 39:35.680]  are in whining but we needed Osama bin Laden or the story was needed in order
[39:35.680 --> 39:40.000]  to get the bad man the reason he's now discovered and ostensibly this attack
[39:40.000 --> 39:43.840]  on a mortuary which I've never you know this is the most absurd story I've ever
[39:43.840 --> 39:48.960]  heard the legitimize is number one the fact that this entire system of
[39:48.960 --> 39:52.480]  intelligence which by the way Americans have to understand they're over a
[39:52.480 --> 40:00.320]  850,000 contractors contractors with top secret clearances now that is the most
[40:00.320 --> 40:03.640]  absurd thing I have ever who have a stake in the fairy tale let me add
[40:03.640 --> 40:11.440]  something because you are a a medical doctor let's break this down now from
[40:11.440 --> 40:16.720]  from my own layman research total renal failure kidney failure for for layman
[40:16.720 --> 40:22.840]  out there the disease he had I went online I went online to a whole bunch of
[40:22.840 --> 40:27.600]  mainline medical sites last night and on the outside they were saying maybe you
[40:27.600 --> 40:31.960]  can live five six years once you're in this position but if you have this
[40:31.960 --> 40:36.640]  disease even less so then I went and pulled up old articles from even the
[40:36.640 --> 40:42.280]  mid 90s saying he had it then and then it was on record you've seen a CIA file
[40:42.280 --> 40:46.320]  so how can a guy that has something that kills you in six years correct me if
[40:46.320 --> 40:52.560]  I'm wrong how can he be alive 16 years later you can't that's why I said on
[40:52.560 --> 40:56.840]  your show even two in nine years ago that dr. Julie one of the physicians of
[40:56.840 --> 41:02.000]  CIA went to the American hospital in Dubai he was already dying under the
[41:02.000 --> 41:04.880]  Clinton administration so you have Clinton implicated it was another
[41:04.880 --> 41:10.720]  provericator and disorder I mean and that was used subsequently in 911
[41:10.720 --> 41:15.280]  because they knew his life was limited that was it he was he was to die so how
[41:15.280 --> 41:20.320]  do you best use the man's imminent death and a psychological warfare routine
[41:20.320 --> 41:24.680]  well you make him the bad guy so you make him the bad guy and then you don't
[41:24.680 --> 41:29.640]  find him for 10 years now that is so absurd in terms of credibility and by
[41:29.640 --> 41:33.680]  the way sir by the way you didn't even know that CBS News had reported that the
[41:33.680 --> 41:37.200]  CIA did go to the American hospital the figure of the French that's been
[41:37.200 --> 41:42.160]  confirmed no I knew this way before no no no I understand I understand and well
[41:42.160 --> 41:46.560]  no you said it on the show years ago before it didn't come out to laughter but
[41:46.560 --> 41:49.920]  they probably got it from you and then went into research but the issue here is
[41:49.920 --> 41:55.400]  that they know full well now his family builds most the military bases in the
[41:55.400 --> 41:58.900]  Middle East they did the air conditioning for Mecca they're one of the
[41:58.900 --> 42:05.160]  richest families in Saudi Arabia working yeah no no I mean exactly his kids
[42:05.160 --> 42:10.280]  his kids you know are all going to Oxford and the rest of it now his now
[42:10.280 --> 42:14.280]  his daughter but we're not seeing her pops up and says it's all true this
[42:14.280 --> 42:18.400]  family from my study correct me if I'm wrong goes back to British intelligence
[42:18.400 --> 42:23.000]  they didn't just send bin Laden in to be the money man for the Mujahideen that you
[42:23.000 --> 42:26.640]  met while you were there running some of the military operations because he fell
[42:26.640 --> 42:31.280]  off an apple truck now my intel is they made the deal with him and his family at
[42:31.280 --> 42:35.680]  the time to let him play the part of the bad guy and since then they've been
[42:35.680 --> 42:41.160]  given even bigger US and British contracts as the payoff
[42:41.160 --> 43:01.160]  you
[43:04.160 --> 43:09.960]  tyranny is here the grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality it really
[43:09.960 --> 43:14.880]  says that the state is God the United States is now recognized globally as one
[43:14.880 --> 43:19.520]  of the most oppressive police states on earth this film conclusively proves the

[45:02.520 --> 45:06.840]  buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[45:06.840 --> 45:11.040]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[45:11.040 --> 45:14.960]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[45:14.960 --> 45:18.600]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[45:18.600 --> 45:23.160]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[45:23.160 --> 45:27.800]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[45:27.800 --> 45:31.560]  the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[45:31.560 --> 45:35.000]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[45:35.000 --> 45:38.960]  onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[45:38.960 --> 45:42.120]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power

[47:00.480 --> 47:06.480]  coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones
[47:06.480 --> 47:21.040]  broadcasting network network we now take you live to the central Texas command
[47:21.040 --> 47:29.880]  center and the heart of the resistance rallying Patriots worldwide
[47:29.880 --> 47:36.880]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[47:36.880 --> 47:42.440]  let me tell you one principle of counterterrorism psychological warfare
[47:42.440 --> 47:47.360]  any terrorist that has been apprehended for the most part as a rule of thumb
[47:47.360 --> 47:53.480]  for example Carlos not only served intelligence of Soviets he served
[47:53.480 --> 47:57.080]  intelligence for the Mossad for the French who caused the question of
[47:57.080 --> 48:02.440]  equality and B&B so within this game of counterterrorism which is really a game
[48:02.440 --> 48:07.920]  a very sick game we create what is called on the Kissinger strategic tension we
[48:07.920 --> 48:12.920]  create strategic tension so we have a legitimate use to go reason to go into a
[48:12.920 --> 48:18.880]  country to either invade suppress or extract whatever mineral rights now let
[48:18.880 --> 48:23.040]  me give you an understanding let me say it very clearly Osama bin Laden was on
[48:23.040 --> 48:28.320]  more than one payroll he was not only the CIA program British payroll I guess
[48:28.320 --> 48:32.960]  who's other payroll he was on Alex Jones the Israelis the Wildcat you got it
[48:32.960 --> 48:38.280]  and he had relationships with Jews in the Middle East and the diamond business
[48:38.280 --> 48:43.160]  and Israel ago absolutely nuts but the New York Times article years ago even
[48:43.160 --> 48:48.480]  reported how a lot of his own money came out of the Jewish diamond dealers and
[48:48.480 --> 48:52.840]  television and his mother you many usually would probably be Jewish but I
[48:52.840 --> 48:56.960]  don't want to get into this entire issue other than the fact that people have
[48:56.960 --> 49:01.560]  to understand when I went after Noriega which also cost my life because he he
[49:01.560 --> 49:04.720]  hunted me down accused me of being an assassin whether it's right or wrong
[49:04.720 --> 49:10.480]  let's not worry about that but he served our intelligence he served Latin
[49:10.480 --> 49:14.680]  American intelligence he served Cuban intelligence he served many intelligence
[49:14.680 --> 49:18.440]  for the same reason when we went after Saddam Hussein by the way I do have to
[49:18.440 --> 49:22.320]  correct you Saddam Hussein was not executed with all due respect Alex
[49:22.320 --> 49:26.320]  Jones we never execute a leader of a country and particularly with Bush
[49:26.320 --> 49:32.600]  Jr. who's a liar and a coward by the way you're saying that's all fake too he was
[49:32.600 --> 49:38.240]  not executed what you saw in effect was a picture of how so-called execution
[49:38.240 --> 49:43.280]  through a camera of somebody's little camera but he is probably somewhere in
[49:43.280 --> 49:48.080]  Central Asia and it Bush Jr. can go in front of a federal court and if he can
[49:48.080 --> 49:51.520]  swear that without holding Cheney's hands the same way he did a commission I
[49:51.520 --> 49:55.680]  will be surprised sir that's like the old Kings rule where kings don't kill
[49:55.680 --> 49:59.320]  kings that's why twice that's exactly that's why twice with Napoleon they
[49:59.320 --> 50:04.360]  put him on islands exactly Edie I mean I worked against Edie I mean he killed
[50:04.360 --> 50:08.600]  187,000 people we didn't kill and we put him in Saudi Arabia he was playing
[50:08.600 --> 50:14.160]  poetry he was writing poetry he was playing golf Noriega was never killed
[50:14.160 --> 50:19.560]  he was sent off to France he has a shadow in France it goes on and on and
[50:19.560 --> 50:24.640]  on Osama bin Laden was already dead we use him all of these so-called villains
[50:24.640 --> 50:29.440]  are used for national security purposes and the vehicle is always a
[50:29.440 --> 50:34.400]  psychological operation to mobilize the American public through the most cynical
[50:34.400 --> 50:39.080]  of all statements national security freedom of speech and in fact what
[50:39.080 --> 50:43.560]  happens is their suppression so the inherent paradox of what our country
[50:43.560 --> 50:47.960]  does to ourselves will come back to fight government repeatedly because the
[50:47.960 --> 50:51.200]  American government will not tolerate American people doctor this is this is
[50:51.200 --> 50:55.680]  too incredible and the time we've got only about 35 minutes with you I don't
[50:55.680 --> 50:58.760]  want to bump Lord Mockton who's popping in but I'm getting really tempted to do
[50:58.760 --> 51:03.880]  it here in a minute okay but no no no no stay there sir because because I am here
[51:03.880 --> 51:07.640]  let's go back let's go back here because every time you mentioned
[51:07.640 --> 51:13.800]  something it opens a whole data mine and my own brain up yes the the the the
[51:13.800 --> 51:21.160]  four al-qaeda leaders you must have been restless at school I was restless but
[51:21.160 --> 51:25.560]  but every time you mention a point then I can see all the data that's public not
[51:25.560 --> 51:29.080]  to mention all the data inside data you have but it's just all confirmed when I
[51:29.080 --> 51:33.640]  was on RT international TV a few days ago they showed the four top al-qaeda
[51:33.640 --> 51:41.640]  people and three of them gadan alaki and one other they admit all born in the
[51:41.640 --> 51:45.760]  U.S. and then I know they're ledgers and we're all alaki Fox News admits secretly
[51:45.760 --> 51:49.280]  at the Pentagon two months after 9-11 dining with the Secretary of the Army he
[51:49.280 --> 51:54.440]  runs the Fort Hood Patsy attacks the underwear bomber of the Times Square the
[51:54.440 --> 51:58.840]  shoe bomber they get the drugged mctollib on the plane I mean this is all
[51:58.840 --> 52:04.360]  admitted and the State Department did correct I mean what's crazy is it but
[52:04.360 --> 52:08.240]  who just had this final point to get to the central premise like my idea but
[52:08.240 --> 52:12.120]  here's my point Adam Gadan is the grandson of the former head of the ADL
[52:12.120 --> 52:16.760]  who was arrested for beating up Arabs outside mosque he hated him so much and
[52:16.760 --> 52:20.920]  the way he gets them is by dressing up in that clown suit with the beard here
[52:20.920 --> 52:27.960]  is this ADL grandson uploading with the Intel Center in the same al-qaeda logo
[52:27.960 --> 52:32.440]  their logo and Wired magazine confirmed they made the video I mean my
[52:32.440 --> 52:36.640]  you're bringing up bin Laden working for Israel I don't think people get what
[52:36.640 --> 52:40.800]  you're saying here they have not think he's working I'm saying that basically
[52:40.800 --> 52:45.600]  he had been funded by you know diamond dealers that was in the New York Times
[52:45.600 --> 52:49.720]  and I'm sure he worked for many other intelligence services including the
[52:49.720 --> 52:54.160]  Brits and others you know because in that game and this is speculation on that
[52:54.160 --> 52:58.480]  part in that game of counted terrorism which unfortunately is a game it is
[52:58.480 --> 53:04.280]  always service of multiple masters in order to justify what we have what they
[53:04.280 --> 53:08.360]  do with national governments do but bin Laden was always dealing in the
[53:08.360 --> 53:13.240]  diamond business I believe his mother was Jewish he's Yemeni and you know the
[53:13.240 --> 53:17.040]  bin Laden family still part of the car law group take a look if they hadn't been
[53:17.040 --> 53:20.520]  on it or they still part of it you can look it up no sir London guarding and
[53:20.520 --> 53:28.640]  headline September 11th 2001 in arty September 12th that he that that that
[53:28.640 --> 53:33.200]  all these top brass and bush people were meeting at the car law group meeting
[53:33.200 --> 53:36.920]  with the bin Laden's there that day that's what I mean there's all there's all
[53:36.920 --> 53:42.240]  these insane connections that's correct it's all connection so basically the
[53:42.240 --> 53:45.360]  question is how do you break these connections and how does the American
[53:45.360 --> 53:52.240]  public stop this nonsensical dangerous cynical disruption as you call it it's
[53:52.240 --> 53:57.200]  destroying the fibers of our country and the answer is you have to get out on the
[53:57.200 --> 54:02.160]  streets and start insisting on freedom of speech insisting that you have to
[54:02.160 --> 54:06.880]  organize yet the American public is not stupid they don't need to have their
[54:06.880 --> 54:11.840]  homework to protect the country and they have to have the man the truth and they
[54:11.840 --> 54:16.480]  have to force the legislators most of whom are cowardly because whether you're
[54:16.480 --> 54:20.480]  public in a Democrat remember the dynamics of a legislator is the
[54:20.480 --> 54:24.840]  pandera he's first says to you very nicely oh please vote for me please vote
[54:24.840 --> 54:28.800]  for me this is what I can do well it's like saying a position like me if I
[54:28.800 --> 54:32.680]  weren't a medical student I go up to you Alice I said listen I want you to pay
[54:32.680 --> 54:36.680]  for my the fact that I'm gonna be a doctor but I'm not a doctor right now
[54:36.680 --> 54:39.840]  but I promise me I'm gonna be a doctor and you can say what are you crazy you
[54:39.840 --> 54:43.000]  haven't shown anything that you can do to be a doctor well that's what Obama did
[54:43.000 --> 54:46.600]  he said look I can run this country but I've never run anything Dr. Pritchett
[54:46.600 --> 54:50.280]  we've got a break we've got a break and and again I hate to interrupt because
[54:50.280 --> 54:55.080]  everything you're saying is so important but then I've got all of these other
[54:55.080 --> 54:59.040]  questions I want to bring up to you and I want to get into the solutions I want
[54:59.040 --> 55:03.720]  to spend a lot of time on that there's also a lot of breaking news CBS news is
[55:03.720 --> 55:08.040]  confirming the president has now given an interview that will be played later
[55:08.040 --> 55:14.200]  this week that they are not going to release the photos and they say Obama
[55:14.200 --> 55:19.280]  said the risk of releasing outweighed the benefits conspiracy theorist around
[55:19.280 --> 55:23.440]  the world will just claim the photos are doctored anyway and there is a real
[55:23.440 --> 55:27.360]  risk that releasing the photos will only serve to inflame public opinion in the
[55:27.360 --> 55:30.560]  Middle East and he went on to attack conspiracy theorist this has been
[55:30.560 --> 55:36.760]  released by CBS news that Obama is responding to conspiracy theorist
[55:36.760 --> 55:41.760]  responding to conspiracy theorist now he's responding to the birth certificate
[55:41.760 --> 55:46.000]  I mean this shows how weak they are and now they're not going to release a photo
[55:46.000 --> 55:51.400]  because any Photoshop expert can put it in a computer and scan it they put out a
[55:51.400 --> 55:55.960]  whether you believe is born in Hawaii or not the experts have now spoken the
[55:55.960 --> 55:59.640]  birth certificate has been altered did they do it on purpose to make the
[55:59.640 --> 56:04.880]  debate continue I don't think so let's let's get it straight what happens when
[56:04.880 --> 56:08.840]  you attack the government whether it's under Bush Junior or Obama and you
[56:08.840 --> 56:13.880]  seeing Obama use it but he's not as effective as Bush Junior was because
[56:13.880 --> 56:18.200]  Bush Junior was I had more CIA operators there who had a better history of
[56:18.200 --> 56:23.160]  psyops the truth is when you don't know what to say you immediately denigrate
[56:23.160 --> 56:27.080]  people like me in particular is what he's talking about people like you Alex
[56:27.080 --> 56:31.360]  and all of your audience by saying we're conspiracy theorist well you know the
[56:31.360 --> 56:36.120]  beauty of life is that there are people who are trying to do nasty things and
[56:36.120 --> 56:40.840]  whether we call it conspiracy theorist or not or he says it's silliness that
[56:40.840 --> 56:45.800]  doesn't mitigate the fact that there's truth and a man who is not able to tell
[56:45.800 --> 56:50.600]  the truth or come to terms with the truth then uses these very flippant words
[56:50.600 --> 56:57.400]  like conspiracy theorist a silly people or a fist or true is these are code words
[56:57.400 --> 57:01.760]  in order to make sure that you're put into a corner where you can't say
[57:01.760 --> 57:06.360]  anything and you're categorized that's a very easy way to delegitimize you in
[57:06.360 --> 57:10.400]  psychological warfare but unfortunately the president really is not very smart
[57:10.400 --> 57:14.120]  contrary to his own self-esteem and if they can listen to this to the White
[57:14.120 --> 57:18.800]  House he's not very bright and I'm saying that because he never really had an
[57:18.800 --> 57:23.440]  education in psychology never really had an education the real world how it
[57:23.440 --> 57:28.000]  works other than the political world of corruption deception denial and lie but
[57:28.000 --> 57:31.680]  he doesn't really know how to effectively use it more importantly needed to
[57:31.680 --> 57:36.040]  anybody around him that's why the storyline and this atrocity and
[57:36.040 --> 57:40.360]  ridiculousness if you want to talk about president's own word silliness of the
[57:40.360 --> 57:44.080]  body of Osama bin Laden that's been dead for nine years but he can't show you a
[57:44.080 --> 57:49.380]  picture of it is it's so absurd it it flashes back and it's what we call a
[57:49.380 --> 57:55.000]  blowback hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[57:55.000 --> 57:59.640]  this is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this
[57:59.640 --> 58:04.120]  agenda that we pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've
[58:04.120 --> 58:08.800]  turned menace influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[58:08.800 --> 58:13.440]  calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[58:13.440 --> 58:17.680]  citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of
[58:17.680 --> 58:22.760]  our nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and
[58:22.760 --> 58:26.640]  on its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the
[58:26.640 --> 58:30.520]  arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who
[58:30.520 --> 58:34.360]  do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in

[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:17.120]  nothing more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by burning
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:21.840]  pages you're a bug mr. Wordsworth a crawling insect ugly
[01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:26.560]  misforned little creature who has no purpose here no meaning I am a human
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:33.920]  being words mr. Wordsworth that have no substance and no dimension like air like

[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:53.760]  delusions mr. Wordsworth delusions that you inject into your veins to make you
[01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:58.080]  think you have a strength when you have no strength at all you have nothing but
[01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:05.360]  spindly limbs of a dream and the state has no use for your time resistance to
[01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:26.240]  tyrants is obedience to God it's Alex Jones
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:29.840]  we know Alcada was created and controlled by the criminal element that
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:33.040]  runs our government and other governments we know they use them as a
[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:36.600]  pretext to launch wars we know they use them as a pretext to have domestic
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:40.320]  police-state crackdowns and to make what government corporations do secret from
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:44.240]  us we the people while they rob us through government control that's
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:49.280]  setting up monopolies for them but clearly we have said that as the economy
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:53.160]  implodes as they launch these new wars that they would then bring in states
[01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:58.840]  terror and this death of bin Laden is a psychological resurrection of him then
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:02.560]  they introduced the four new bin Laden's three of which on record trained in the
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:06.880]  U.S. two of which on record absolutely worked for the federal government at the
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:10.240]  highest levels of black ops and they're so arrogant it's just admitted
[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:14.760]  everywhere but still it's not kosher to point that out so they're rolling them
[01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:18.720]  out just like they did pre-911 I'm seeing the exact same preconditioning so
[01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:25.600]  maximum maximum total red alert everyone and in fact I'm gonna ask Aaron
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:29.560]  Dyches to do this next hour we need to get the White House number the Congress
[01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:34.960]  number the switchboard launch operation expose the government terrorist part to

[01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:58.840]  numbers and call them we need links in the articles to all these White House
[01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:02.800]  advisors like Robert Shapiro in the Financial Times of London saying a
[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:06.840]  terror attack would sure help us it sure be great Obama's got to get an
[01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:10.360]  Oklahoma City or 9-11 so you can get his New World Order we need all those
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:14.560]  Republican neocons that wrote the tutorials saying how great September 11
[01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:18.160]  was see they're all communicating with each other like we're too stupid to see
[01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:24.240]  it begging for it calling for it all that stands between the New World Order
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:28.280]  just taking all the pension funds watching World War three with Pakistan
[01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:31.920]  they've got no every analyst says it will it will probably trigger World War
[01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:36.640]  three not may this is also part of framing Pakistan it always says a
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:41.000]  geopolitical external foreign policy elements of the domestic policy they're
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.760]  like full-spectrum win-win wins oh everyone listen to me very carefully
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:52.680]  right now please take this to heart all that stands between pre-humanity our
[01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:56.760]  children the innocent people the folks on fixed incomes people on Social
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:04:01.000]  Security people that have paid into public and private pensions the globalist
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.360]  have done this in every other country they've fully taken over the only thing
[01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:09.320]  that stands between us and real hot tyranny I mean the arrest wagons going
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:13.920]  around the FEMA camps being filled mushroom clouds the only thing that
[01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:20.160]  stands between us and that is we the people look in the mirror if you look
[01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:24.360]  at the mainstream media hundreds of newspapers prestigious establishment
[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:32.280]  magazines are lowering their guns on us from their pile of sess and and firing
[01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:38.240]  at info wars.com Alex Jones Dr. Pachennick we are the resistance when we
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:42.560]  come back we're going to talk about this you are the resistance folks you are

[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:50.160]  with Steve Watson dr. Steve Pachennick coming up Aaron Dykes I have key intel
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:59.840]  straight ahead
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:05.280]  a very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most
[01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:09.360]  important day in America in more than 50 years he says it will change
[01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:13.240]  everything about our lives the way you shop travel invest educate your
[01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:16.720]  children and even how you take care of your health and your own family now this
[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:20.440]  man has made some outrageous predictions over the years the crazy part is
[01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:24.560]  he's usually right you see he predicted the collapse of GM Danny May

[01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:33.400]  we're back live it's the Alex Chuncho May 5th 2011 coming up at the top of the
[01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:40.080]  hour Steve Arpojenik top spy masterworks under five different US presidents to
[01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:46.320]  talk about the bin Laden fable now we have President Barack Obama mimicking
[01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:51.560]  George W. Bush he's descended on ground zero and Obama according to the
[01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:57.480]  associate press is now basically repeating exact similar phrases that
[01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:03.000]  George Bush used as he stood on the rubble in those days after 9-11 as
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:07.920]  Obama desperately attempts to seize on the political capital that this bin
[01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:13.320]  Laden raid has afforded him but I'm delighted to say that we've been joined
[01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:17.760]  by Paul Craig Roberts who many of you will know of course was the father of
[01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:24.880]  Reaganomics served as assistant treasury secretary under Ronald Reagan former
[01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:30.400]  editor of the Wall Street Journal and of course Mr. Roberts is a prolific author
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:36.160]  and writer whose articles we eagerly await to be posted his latest article on
[01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:41.320]  prisonplanet.com this morning mr. Roberts great to have you on the show
[01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:48.000]  today thank you Paul good to speak to you before you start get started with me
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:53.720]  let I won't I was fascinated by the piece yesterday your report I think it
[01:07:53.720 --> 01:08:01.120]  was on Steve Pazinik did I pronounce that right Steve Pachennik yeah yeah I
[01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:07.120]  thought this was amazing not so much the bin Laden part because I think that's
[01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:12.400]  been known for some time but his statement that he had been told by a
[01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:18.080]  general from I think Wolfowitz staff that not alone was the inside job and
[01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:26.000]  that he was willing himself Paul Steve Pazinik to testify on the oath before
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.720]  Congress and reveal the guy's name now this is an astonishing
[01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:35.080]  development this is for real I take it I take it you've got this on tape and
[01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:41.480]  video or something it was said live during mr. Pachennik's interview with
[01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:45.680]  Alex Jones on Tuesday and that's right and it's been it's an
[01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:49.280]  astounding admission which has been completely ignored by the mainstream
[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:57.960]  media they didn't even try and debunk it you know I'm not his credentials are
[01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:03.800]  substantial but what puzzles me about it is I mean that kind of marks him for a
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:07.720]  dead man doesn't I mean they're not they're either going to ignore him or
[01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:11.560]  they're gonna kill him I mean while he is well connected as he's been in
[01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:16.840]  government seems to me he would know that he says something like that he's
[01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:20.560]  gonna have an accident before anybody takes him up on the offer I mean that
[01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:29.480]  strikes me is reckless almost I mean what I've been really puzzled about why
[01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:39.080]  he would say that I mean I can understand revealing it but not you know not
[01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:44.440]  forecasting that he was gonna reveal it that's one thing they won't let be
[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:48.840]  revealed they're not gonna let that happen exactly I mean Alex asked him
[01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:52.800]  about that Alex was trying to get him on air to say you know I'm not suicidal
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:57.440]  like the DC madam and obviously we know what happened to her but Pachennik
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:02.720]  basically said you know I've I'm a professional I've got dirt on them and
[01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:06.920]  he was basically not afraid of that but he's actually coming up as a guest at
[01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:12.120]  the top of the hour and that's something I can press him further on in the in the
[01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:19.280]  next hour of the show my question my question for you mr. Roberts is you
[01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:23.480]  wrote on Monday that the whole Bin Laden thing had quote the order of a staged
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:29.440]  event now you've been justified in that assessment with these situation room
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:35.040]  photos that the media told us were an account of Obama and Hillary Clinton
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:39.480]  watching the live assassination of Bin Laden unfold that has now been
[01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:43.720]  documented to be completely fraudulent the live video stream was cut off they
[01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:49.040]  saw nothing of the raid you've you've wrote this other article today which is
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:53.600]  excellent what what do you think of the most alarming discrepancies in this whole
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:59.720]  Bin Laden narrative that we've been sold on by the White House and the media well
[01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:08.120]  you know Paul the thing was never believable in the beginning because the
[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:18.280]  original story of a firefight with the heroic seals taking on Al Qaeda which
[01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:23.760]  Rumsfeld described Rumsfeld described as the most highly trained the most
[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:29.000]  dangerous most vicious killers on the planet and so they get the seals getting
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:33.280]  to a firefight with these vicious highly trained killers and they don't get a
[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:39.840]  scratch so that already tells you something stinks because you anybody
[01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:49.480]  can hear a helicopter coming you know even even people are asleep so then
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:55.440]  before 48 hours pass the whole story changes fundamentally there's no
[01:11:55.440 --> 01:12:01.880]  firefight Bin Laden's not a coward after all hiding behind a woman and he's not
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:07.040]  even armed says the White House press book that the direct quote he wasn't
[01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:14.240]  armed and so all of a sudden we go from heroes in a firefight to cold-blooded
[01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:21.080]  murderers and even worse even if you believe the government story you have
[01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:27.720]  to see it as the most botched operation in history so why in the world would you
[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:35.040]  kill the mastermind who has all the secrets of terrorism when he's unarmed
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:42.360]  harmless and surrounded that's the last thing you would do is to kill him and so
[01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:49.680]  that part of the story it's not so much a discrepancy that's important it's the
[01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:57.880]  story itself it makes no sense and the reason they had to say that is they
[01:12:57.880 --> 01:13:02.040]  didn't capture him they didn't kill him he wasn't there he was already dead this
[01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:09.880]  is a staged event for a bunch of hidden agendas not merely for Obama's popularity
[01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:14.400]  and poll ratings and reelection campaign that's no doubt part of it but
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:19.320]  there are other agendas that this event is being used for for example the
[01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:26.760]  justification of torture is one probably starting more trouble with Pakistan is
[01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:32.800]  another more powers for homeland security is another probably more false flag
[01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:39.920]  attacks that they will say is due to Al Qaeda retaliation for killing bin
[01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:49.880]  law and they're all kinds of agendas that are hiding behind this this false story so the
[01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:56.920]  dead giveaway is that if you actually did catch this guy you wouldn't quickly
[01:13:56.920 --> 01:14:03.680]  throw the evidence of your success under the ocean the minute you do that the
[01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:09.000]  whole story becomes suspect because there's no real explanation for why they
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:15.320]  dumped the body in the ocean the story they give is obviously a fabrication and
[01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:21.280]  this incorrect that they were giving him a quick burial in keeping with Muslim
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:26.080]  practices this has been challenged by the Muslim demons they say that you're
[01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:29.840]  supposed to be buried in the ground of the head pointed toward Mecca and that
[01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:35.400]  the only excuse for dumping somebody at sea is if it's a very long voyage and
[01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:42.360]  the body is decomposing and so every aspect of the story is phony there's
[01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:49.360]  nothing true about any of it and and the other great puzzle Paul is why did they
[01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:54.320]  change the story if you're gonna pull off something like this you got to know
[01:14:54.320 --> 01:15:00.000]  what the story is and stick with it and yet before 48 hours passes the whole
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:08.200]  story changed fundamentally why what was the pressure to change the story they
[01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:12.440]  didn't have to worry about Pakistan ratting on them Pakistan is enough of
[01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:18.840]  an American public puppet that if it was ordered to shut up it would shut up I
[01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:25.840]  mean Pakistan lets the United States conduct illegal military actions on its
[01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:31.400]  territory killing its citizens Pakistan lets the United States Army spend the
[01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:36.760]  Pakistani army into tribal areas into entire provinces displacing entire
[01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:42.800]  populations of people if boys and tells Pakistan hey we're gonna stage this
[01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:59.320]  thing and we want your help and you but not saying about it they're going to cooperate
[01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:05.040]  hi folks this is Alex Jones I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to

[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:07.320]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:11.480]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:15.520]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:19.400]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:23.680]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:27.840]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:32.160]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:35.880]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:40.040]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:43.040]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by

[01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:07.680]  coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones broadcasting
[01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:23.880]  network the real question is why story change what's what's going on is it are
[01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:28.080]  people in the government now I'm just speculating I have any idea of people in
[01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:32.240]  the government now seeing they don't want to bomb us some of them don't want
[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:37.840]  to bomber again and and they see that he's managed to do this to boost his
[01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:42.680]  poll ratings by 24% and so now they're going to undermine it because they want
[01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:46.520]  to get rid of him or they really have a different puppet or something is all
[01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:51.440]  kinds of things are going on that we don't know about and that might explain
[01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:59.640]  why the administration the government is destroying its own story it's not being
[01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:07.400]  destroyed by news people the news people are still celebrating the the victory
[01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:16.040]  over bin Laden and the news people have given the imprimatur to extra legal
[01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:23.680]  murder of unarmed people so it's not the news media who's exposed is the
[01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:27.600]  government itself that keeps changing the story and where's the pressure coming
[01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:37.800]  from to change story I mean why create such massive credibility problems for
[01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:42.800]  the government some story so maybe all the people inside the government are
[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:48.960]  fighting each other over who they want to run the next time I don't know what's
[01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:55.040]  going on but it's that's the biggest puzzle to me maybe somebody on your
[01:21:55.040 --> 01:22:01.160]  desk and maybe Steve today can throw some light on that but that is the most
[01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:07.840]  interesting question so the two real questions and I'll be finished here one
[01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:15.680]  is what are the real agendas that this news event is designed to further and
[01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:25.680]  to why did the government wreck its own story by changing it before 48 hours or
[01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:35.840]  over without any obvious sources of pressure on them to change story the
[01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:40.000]  Kennedy story the Kennedy was killed by Oswald period and then we've had that
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:44.160]  story now for what 40 50 years or something they don't change it why they
[01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:51.560]  change a story they haven't changed the 9-11 story and well exactly I mean you've
[01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:56.600]  got the press secretary Carney who's now being lambasted by all sides of the
[01:22:56.600 --> 01:23:01.840]  media as this flounder this failure because he's having difficulty getting
[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:05.160]  the fable straight he keeps tripping over his words he keeps giving
[01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:09.720]  contradictory explanations and like you said it's it's baffling it's almost as
[01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:15.080]  if it's deliberately designed to look hokey I mean you've got neighbors
[01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:19.680]  surrounding this so-called compound they say they'd never saw bin Laden it's a
[01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:24.640]  stones throw away from a Pakistani military base all the residents have
[01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:29.360]  to have ID cards they have to go through checkpoints to get anywhere and the only
[01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:33.960]  photos that have been released are of these victims because none of them have
[01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:39.840]  bin Laden and it's increasingly starting to look like he was I mean we know that
[01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:43.280]  every intelligence professional worth their salt said that he's been dead for
[01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:48.640]  nine years it's starting to look as if perhaps some members of the bin Laden
[01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:53.960]  family were there and that's that's what they used as the reason to go in but I
[01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:57.520]  mean it's it's like in your article today you quote this email that you
[01:23:57.520 --> 01:24:03.000]  received from a reader who asks you know why the government so sloppy and it's
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:08.160]  lies that it virtually makes no effort to make them appear credible I mean why
[01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:12.040]  are they so arrogant in their total disregard for the intellect of the
[01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:16.960]  American people I think the answer that Paul is they got away with 9-11 they
[01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:22.320]  blew up two skyscrapers in plain view of everybody in plain view of the TV
[01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:27.040]  cameras we've got recordings all over the world of these buildings being blown
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:30.280]  up anybody that looks at those buildings can see they're being blown up
[01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:34.600]  they're not falling down these are not buildings falling down from structural
[01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:38.800]  damage from an airliner or fire these are buildings are blowing up you can see
[01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:42.760]  they're blowing up if they get away with that if they can get away with the
[01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:47.080]  fable that a few thoughties with boxcutters can outweigh at all 16
[01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:52.680]  American intelligence agencies all the intelligence agencies of NATO of Israel
[01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:59.080]  even can outweigh at NORAD air traffic control airport security four times in
[01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:04.720]  one morning can cause the state-of-the-art Pentagon air defenses to fail
[01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:10.280]  anybody can pull off this superhero stuff how could anybody believe that you
[01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:16.280]  can't I mean did you see the film V for Vendetta where the superhero blows up the
[01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:23.520]  British Parliament well the 9-11 attack makes that look like nothing and yet
[01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:28.760]  people fall for these things I mean so they I guess that's the reason the
[01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:34.840]  government just shows it doesn't make any effort to even make a credible lie
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:41.080]  it just knows that it can use the Patriot card and 80% of the people will
[01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:45.680]  fall for it the patriotism will and they'll be all we got him how we got
[01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:51.480]  the towel head so that's what they rely on I think they don't think anybody is
[01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:58.280]  gonna think about it people are just gonna celebrate and if you start
[01:25:58.280 --> 01:26:01.600]  thinking about it you have to give up celebrating and they'd rather celebrate
[01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:07.200]  than be suspicious of their government that's probably the the answer I thought
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:13.320]  that reader that you quoted had made a very good point and raised the central
[01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:17.880]  question that's why I put it in my article today but I think that's the
[01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:24.560]  answer Paul they they know look they've always got away with everything you know
[01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:32.000]  remember the main the Gulf of Tonkin weapons of mass destruction
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:37.400]  governments all the world have got away with these things you know the Hitler
[01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:41.360]  got away with the Reichstag fire they blamed it on the left wing or some
[01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:47.000]  deranged commie these things are commonplace in history and they always
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:55.600]  work in fact I wonder if there are any examples it didn't work I can't think of
[01:26:55.600 --> 01:27:02.360]  any of him maybe they are some somewhere well it's with everything like you
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:07.480]  said it I mean Operation Gladio they got away with that as well and I think it
[01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:12.680]  comes down to the fact that when people are not don't have time or don't have the
[01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:18.160]  effort to scratch the surface on these things they just throw in their lot with
[01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:22.480]  the US government as if it's some kind of baseball team like they scored a major
[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:29.440]  victory I mean in the aftermath of the bombardment of Iraq pizza and beer
[01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:34.000]  sales went through the roof and it's kind of just this dumbing down this
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:39.120]  reduction of what amounts in the end to the slaughter of thousands and millions
[01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:43.920]  of people to support in a baseball team or a football team and that's that's the
[01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:49.440]  kind of post 9-11 mental castration that they're now trying to reinvigorate
[01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:56.960]  after this latest fraud I think that must be it many have suggested that we had
[01:27:56.960 --> 01:28:02.160]  these reports a couple of weeks ago about the Pakistani government protesting
[01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:06.360]  about the US drone strikes simply because of the fact that they've killed so
[01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:11.640]  many innocent people in Pakistan we had the Prime Minister of Pakistan Yusuf
[01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:16.800]  Randha Jilani saying quote these attacks are creating a lot of problems for us the
[01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:21.320]  US will have to stop these attacks and of course there were massive protests in
[01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:27.080]  Pakistan about these drone strikes just days before this bin Laden fraud was
[01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:33.000]  rolled out Pakistan is now being geopolitically isolated they're saying
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:37.560]  that Pakistan was harboring bin Laden all along of course that only means that
[01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:42.840]  so was the CIA it's tied with the Pakistani ISI at the hip those are the
[01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:47.680]  two organizations that created bin Laden as a terrorist leader in the first
[01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:52.040]  place so a lot of people are suggesting that it's a kind of reprisal against
[01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:57.960]  Pakistan for their unwillingness to continue going along with this support
[01:28:57.960 --> 01:29:02.920]  and then had your money in the US Empire over the last year Alex has told you about

[01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:11.800]  Broadcasting Network
[01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:43.200]  down well we see the 2012 kickoff of Obama's campaign they claim they jumped
[01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:47.240]  the body of bin Laden in the ocean they released a fake photo Sunday night
[01:33:47.240 --> 01:33:51.920]  yesterday morning had to admit it was a fake photo they've got new fake photos
[01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:58.920]  we'll play just a few seconds of this they've released of course cartoons
[01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:04.640]  showing bin Laden shooting his AK-47 and the Navy SEALs taking him out we'll
[01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:09.680]  roll some of that in the background right now for folks this is so cartoonish
[01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:16.920]  and what concerns me more than anything is that our expert guests have broken
[01:34:16.920 --> 01:34:22.520]  down here on air Webster Tarpley investigative journalist Wayne Madsen
[01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:26.400]  others we've also seen this in the foreign news that Pakistan was starting
[01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:29.440]  to make deals with Saudi Arabia the Saudi Arabia knows it's being double
[01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:34.720]  crossed by the West and that there was going to be big movement in Pakistan
[01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:40.120]  Pakistan said get your drones out of the country and then magically this happens
[01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:45.280]  there's this raid and now they're saying that Pakistan knew he was there for
[01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:50.120]  six years as if Western intelligence wouldn't know that either and they
[01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:55.280]  won't produce the body this is a serious frame up it looks like of Pakistan
[01:34:55.280 --> 01:35:00.800]  moving towards serious confrontations Lieutenant General Hamid Ghul former
[01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:04.560]  head of Pakistani intelligence really leading the attack on the Soviets in the
[01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:09.040]  1980s called a hero by our media at the time he's been called now by some of our
[01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:15.040]  media the real leader of Al Qaeda which he says his asinine General Ghul thank
[01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:21.760]  you so much for joining us sir thank you Alex I know you have a lot of other
[01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:25.120]  media to attend to we only got about 25 minutes with you sir you've got the
[01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:29.800]  floor break down now that we have some more time to look at this propaganda
[01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:35.120]  move where you stand and what you believe is happening geopolitically but I
[01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:41.120]  think they are targeting Pakistan and I think it is as it was said by New York
[01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:47.400]  time is now gearing up he's limbering up for launching his third offensive against
[01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:52.240]  Pakistan so I think that is where Pakistan is in corner now a case is being
[01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:58.120]  built against Pakistan and they are saying that ISI was harboring this great
[01:35:58.120 --> 01:36:04.640]  terrorist but at the same time if you look at it professionally all the time
[01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:11.280]  the CIA the political leadership of America and and even all the European
[01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:15.760]  countries and their intelligence services were actually putting Pakistani
[01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:21.280]  intelligence from the wrong posse by saying that the high-value targets are
[01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:27.640]  hiding in north of the Iran in and that terrain which adjoins with Afghanistan
[01:36:27.640 --> 01:36:35.280]  so they were pounding Pakistani civilians and poor hapless the villages
[01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:40.600]  there with their drone attacks with the health fires and with their missiles so
[01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:45.800]  they have caused something like 2500 casualties when the man that they were
[01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:51.720]  hunting was actually hiding in one of the urban centers of Pakistan now this
[01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:56.600]  is remarkable I mean they it is not it's an intelligence okay we accept their
[01:36:56.600 --> 01:37:02.280]  version and we say that they are not craving up and this is not something
[01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:08.360]  although that is a very popular theory here in Pakistan but if we were to
[01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:13.520]  believe every word of what they're saying then they are more responsible for
[01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:19.240]  misguiding Pakistani intelligence other intelligence agencies because the CIA
[01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:25.760]  and FBI and MI6 had been given free hand in Pakistan to hunt down the terrorists
[01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:29.320]  toward they had named and we had caught so many of them from Khalid Sheikh
[01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:33.320]  Muhammad to Faraj Ali P and all the others from the urban centers of
[01:37:33.320 --> 01:37:40.520]  Pakistan so why were they not also responsible for this failure agreed that
[01:37:40.520 --> 01:37:44.000]  there have been intelligence failure in this intelligence crap
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:47.960]  failures are not something which is outlandish there's some time they do
[01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:57.040]  happen but ISI instead of being lauded for its good work I think ISI was there
[01:37:57.040 --> 01:38:01.760]  has been scapegoated by the CIA and all the other big weeks there in America and
[01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:06.240]  they want to now build a case against Pakistan although Pakistan really is
[01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:11.360]  suffering so much because our sovereignty has been trampled over our security has
[01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:16.880]  been reached these helicopters they had spotted the blind areas in our radar
[01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:22.640]  coverage and they came in as if they were the enemies of Pakistan now it brings
[01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:28.120]  to light that the relationship with Pakistan and America's relationship was
[01:38:28.120 --> 01:38:33.960]  always one of animosity not friendship and while we were being told that we are
[01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:37.440]  kind of America and we are doing everything possible for them we lost
[01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:44.760]  something like the 35,000 lives in this process and we suffered a loss of 68
[01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:51.560]  billion dollars in economic terms only and everything else that went wrong with
[01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:57.040]  Pakistan the revenge war and so on so forth Pakistan has suffered enormously
[01:38:57.040 --> 01:39:01.840]  but now they tell us that you are responsible for everything isn't it
[01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:08.800]  amazing and if let's say Osama is the one that they killed yesterday why did
[01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:12.320]  they have to kill him he was a sick man he could have been hauled up in the
[01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:18.760]  helicopter and taken away and you and imagine they haven't shown the pictures
[01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:22.240]  they used to show the pictures of Saddam Hussein and they used to show his
[01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:26.800]  teeth also inside of his mouth and they used to rejoice over it and now when it
[01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:32.440]  comes to Osama they are they say that dump him in the sea as soon as possible I
[01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:39.160]  think there is a lot that goes unsaid and I think it has to be it's an untold
[01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:43.880]  story which has to come out one day and I think a probe must be held if the
[01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:48.480]  American administration is reluctant to hold that probe themselves let the
[01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:54.720]  international community demand from them that we we ignored the 9-11 thing
[01:39:54.720 --> 01:40:00.120]  because you said that this had happened to us and we didn't ask for the evidence
[01:40:00.120 --> 01:40:05.600]  but now it's about time that we asked for the evidence general ghoul you brought
[01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:11.480]  up a point that is absolutely central obviously here the saber rattling began
[01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:16.400]  against Pakistan recently when Pakistan said enough of the drones I've
[01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:22.360]  interviewed special forces troops on air we've had Colonel Schaefer on repeatedly
[01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:26.360]  and we've had the calls from listeners it's been admitted in the news that US
[01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:32.440]  troops CIA special forces given unfettered access everywhere in Pakistan
[01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:38.920]  for now many many years and the fact that they're blaming Pakistan and saying
[01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:43.200]  you knew he was there for six years you just threw the gauntlet right back down
[01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:48.080]  and said you were all over this country you've been directing the Pakistani army
[01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:52.920]  into regions to back you up going into tribal areas which of course as you have
[01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:56.600]  pointed out does stir up the population and then they're called terrorist and
[01:40:56.600 --> 01:41:01.640]  now they have us believe in the heart of your West Point and the heart of much
[01:41:01.640 --> 01:41:06.800]  of your intelligence system he was there so if he was there basically what
[01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:13.280]  you're saying correct me if I'm wrong 100% six years the US British Israelis
[01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:18.840]  they knew as well that's indeed because I think they have to share the
[01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:22.640]  responsibility they can't shrug it out because they were the superior partner
[01:41:22.640 --> 01:41:28.080]  in this war against terrorism and they had more resources far far far more
[01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:33.480]  resources than I ever possessed so you were responsible equally responsible
[01:41:33.480 --> 01:41:37.960]  and besides you were all the time focusing the ISI directing them towards
[01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:41.880]  the Northwest Frontier province why were you doing this now this is an
[01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:47.600]  example they always get away they never are answerable they were never
[01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:53.040]  answerable to 9 11 for 9 11 because no head were rolled at that time none from
[01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:58.320]  the air traffic control none from the FBI none from the CIA and it's none from
[01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:04.400]  the Air Force we took 112 minutes to come into action can you imagine they
[01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:08.080]  killed Osama bin Laden if at all that was Osama bin Laden I don't believe there
[01:42:08.080 --> 01:42:12.120]  are a lot of theories which are going on here but suppose they killed Osama bin Laden
[01:42:12.120 --> 01:42:17.520]  why did they have to kill him so that if they he's taken alive if they had asked
[01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:23.080]  the ISI pointed out to the ISI which they knew then ISI would capture him
[01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:29.000]  alive and then he would be put on trial and he will spill the beans that 9 11
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:34.000]  was not done by him and this was the fear because of which they didn't inform the ISI
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:39.440]  and they went for this hunt themselves independently
[01:42:39.440 --> 01:43:04.640]  over the last year Alex has told you about and many of you have experienced
[01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:08.480]  emergencies and disasters and unprecedented numbers people have had

[01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:05.400]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[01:46:05.400 --> 01:46:10.040]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[01:46:10.040 --> 01:46:13.880]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've
[01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:19.120]  tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the
[01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:24.280]  sharks I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[01:46:24.280 --> 01:46:28.800]  attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:33.480]  offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:37.520]  constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're
[01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:41.200]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to
[01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:46.280]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen
[01:46:46.280 --> 01:46:52.320]  a fall of the Republic yet your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info

[01:47:07.760 --> 01:47:10.840]  network network
[01:47:10.840 --> 01:47:20.560]  I saw in press TV at last night the Iranian government is saying they have
[01:47:20.560 --> 01:47:28.200]  intel that Al Qaeda back from when Al Qaeda was the good guys in the 80s was
[01:47:28.200 --> 01:47:33.040]  going to leak the fact that US intelligence was basically puppeteering
[01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:37.640]  terrorists to then blame it on Mujahideen and it came out last week in
[01:47:37.640 --> 01:47:43.600]  sky television that the number one Al Qaeda operative inside Pakistan carrying
[01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:48.960]  out attacks on the Pakistani military and this is confirmed was MI6 it's also
[01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:54.080]  been confirmed even Loftus former head of counterterrorism with the FBI Mr.
[01:47:54.080 --> 01:47:59.400]  Loftus John Loftus he came out on Fox and said that a SWAT ran the 7-7 bombings
[01:47:59.400 --> 01:48:04.760]  in London he is MI6 and has an MI6 security clearance to travel wherever he
[01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:08.600]  wishes while he's on the news as the head terrorist and we're all a locky
[01:48:08.600 --> 01:48:13.800]  trained in the US born in the US Fox News reports does dine secretly at the
[01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:18.400]  Pentagon and get orders he then runs the Patsy attacks as the former head of
[01:48:18.400 --> 01:48:21.560]  Pakistani intelligence someone with connections I know you don't like to
[01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:28.200]  speculate but looking at the evidence we have bottom line there is this group
[01:48:28.200 --> 01:48:33.360]  they call Al Qaeda that are really double triple agents carrying out events to
[01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:39.360]  then be framed on Iraq on Libya on Pakistan on Iran a cookie cutter whoever
[01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:43.880]  they want to attack is that a correct assessment in my analysis or can you add
[01:48:43.880 --> 01:48:50.400]  to that general ghoul absolutely Alex I think you're absolutely on the dot this
[01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:54.200]  is what they're doing they are out to conquer the world at the cost of the
[01:48:54.200 --> 01:48:58.320]  American people their comfort their lives their blood at the cost of their
[01:48:58.320 --> 01:49:04.560]  hard-earned dollars they have this group is is devastating I mean they have they
[01:49:04.560 --> 01:49:11.040]  are harboring such ambitions which are anti humanity which I anti above all the
[01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:15.880]  American people and if you give them free hand now they are trying to go for
[01:49:15.880 --> 01:49:20.640]  Pakistan and this will be disaster because a desperate Pakistan would be a
[01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:24.600]  terrible thing for them to handle I don't know why they are building up case
[01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:30.840]  against Pakistan and they will be in the in in that case the pressure
[01:49:30.840 --> 01:49:35.960]  intelligence gave out the information Pakistan was unfortunately not able to
[01:49:35.960 --> 01:49:40.680]  do so because of the reason because America's come down hard upon them but
[01:49:40.680 --> 01:49:46.240]  he was carrying some ounces of enriched uranium and he was to go and carry out
[01:49:46.240 --> 01:49:51.320]  some kind of action somewhere else and then blame it on Pakistan that Pakistan
[01:49:51.320 --> 01:49:56.800]  nuclear assets are leaky and therefore they have to be taken out they have to
[01:49:56.800 --> 01:50:03.160]  be plucked out and this is why fear is that they have spotted the area from
[01:50:03.160 --> 01:50:07.520]  where they can infiltrate and they can come and pick up our nuclear efforts or
[01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:11.600]  do whatever they want because they have such a liberty of movement here
[01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:16.120]  unfortunately because of for political sheriff who was a dictator and they
[01:50:16.120 --> 01:50:19.800]  supported him to the hill and he framed such policies which are being now
[01:50:19.800 --> 01:50:27.240]  followed by the present regime which called itself democratic but it is not
[01:50:27.240 --> 01:50:31.080]  democratic because it is the product of the NRO the National
[01:50:31.080 --> 01:50:36.920]  Recreation Order which was actually stage managed by Condoleezza rise and it
[01:50:36.920 --> 01:50:43.600]  was signed between David Willy Band of the UK and Richard Boucher from the
[01:50:43.600 --> 01:50:48.040]  American side and of course president from this side and Benazir at that
[01:50:48.040 --> 01:50:53.840]  time but Benazir became a little violent and she started reacting so she had to
[01:50:53.840 --> 01:50:58.600]  be removed by them if you remember John Negroponte came here and he
[01:50:58.600 --> 01:51:02.520]  wanted to talk to her that she was becoming rebellious and he refused to
[01:51:02.520 --> 01:51:08.200]  meet him and then thereafter she was no more I think this is a very dirty game
[01:51:08.200 --> 01:51:14.440]  which is being played by this group incredible information sir I'd like to
[01:51:14.440 --> 01:51:18.980]  go back to the American recently arrested by Pakistani intelligence thank
[01:51:18.980 --> 01:51:23.320]  God you stopped him it's now been confirmed he was trying to get uranium
[01:51:23.320 --> 01:51:31.000]  to some of their cutout alkydopatsis to claim that your nuclear weapons program
[01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:39.640]  is leaking clearly they now are moving to go into Pakistan will they try coups
[01:51:39.640 --> 01:51:45.880]  to bring in a soft coup or according to my military sources they are preparing
[01:51:45.880 --> 01:51:52.080]  commando style attacks bombardments going in getting the nukes and then
[01:51:52.080 --> 01:51:57.200]  starting a larger attack and then having India attack but the word is China's not
[01:51:57.200 --> 01:52:00.640]  going to put up with this I mean we're talking about World War three general
[01:52:00.640 --> 01:52:06.440]  please give us the possible scenarios and the timeframe on this but I think it
[01:52:06.440 --> 01:52:13.680]  was my crystal idea and he is briefing to the to the president he had said that
[01:52:13.680 --> 01:52:19.160]  he only needs a couple of helicopters and some commandos and an
[01:52:19.160 --> 01:52:23.920]  abcyling rope and then he can go and pluck out anything that you have and I
[01:52:23.920 --> 01:52:29.480]  mean he said I'll require a packing of three helicopters and they can take out
[01:52:29.480 --> 01:52:33.840]  Pakistan's all the nuclear triggers but then they thought the better of it
[01:52:33.840 --> 01:52:38.040]  because Pakistan nuclear assets are dispersed and if you touch Pakistan
[01:52:38.040 --> 01:52:42.360]  nuclear assets and a lot of countries in the region who are very dear to America
[01:52:42.360 --> 01:52:47.160]  may be in trouble besides that I think right behind our back China who is a
[01:52:47.160 --> 01:52:51.880]  very reliable friend Pakistan will be left with no option but to lean upon
[01:52:51.880 --> 01:52:56.160]  China and that could as you are very rightly pointing out that could start a
[01:52:56.160 --> 01:53:00.400]  third world war it is very dangerous I don't know what why are they trying to
[01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:05.800]  play with fire because it will ignite an inferno which will consume the entire
[01:53:05.800 --> 01:53:10.560]  region they're completely power mad sir and they've been setting up a secret
[01:53:10.560 --> 01:53:14.800]  police grid a demonization grid of real American patriots that just want to be a
[01:53:14.800 --> 01:53:18.040]  good country with a bill of rights and Constitution who don't want to be an
[01:53:18.040 --> 01:53:22.480]  empire but we have this wicked group that has seized us and it just gives me
[01:53:22.480 --> 01:53:27.680]  chills for my family and my future that that that the Rand Corporation and
[01:53:27.680 --> 01:53:31.800]  others have said they want to start a third world war to try to establish this
[01:53:31.800 --> 01:53:35.560]  world government you notice this is all happening as the dollar begins to die
[01:53:35.560 --> 01:53:40.320]  they actually plan to kill the dollar in this process betray America after we're
[01:53:40.320 --> 01:53:45.080]  the bad guy attacking you and others and then Europe comes out with its new
[01:53:45.080 --> 01:53:48.800]  global currency but that's more academic in the few minutes we've got left
[01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:54.640]  with you general getting back to your intel connections in government I know
[01:53:54.640 --> 01:53:59.520]  you don't like to speculate but we know this official story now they admit he
[01:53:59.520 --> 01:54:02.720]  didn't fire back that he didn't use the wife as a shield they've already put out
[01:54:02.720 --> 01:54:06.760]  a fake photo a day and a half ago they say more fake photos coming and we know
[01:54:06.760 --> 01:54:10.880]  their history of faking documents and photos this whole thing stinks to high
[01:54:10.880 --> 01:54:14.640]  heaven much of our media is turning against the president saying people are
[01:54:14.640 --> 01:54:21.320]  not buying this but what best do you know because now the Pakistani military
[01:54:21.320 --> 01:54:26.280]  has been able to go in but it's all been scooped out what was there what is the
[01:54:26.280 --> 01:54:31.360]  intel what does Pakistani ISI what does the Pakistani army think really went on
[01:54:31.360 --> 01:54:37.800]  in that compound I mean obviously it's the frame up of Pakistan but but but do
[01:54:37.800 --> 01:54:43.280]  you have any intel on how this theater was executed yeah I think much of it what
[01:54:43.280 --> 01:54:47.080]  they have said that the helicopter sneaking in and that the other that is
[01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:51.840]  true because they did come and there are eyewitnesses who have reported this and
[01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:56.920]  I was just watching on the TV channel a lot of people in the neighborhood was
[01:54:56.920 --> 01:55:03.520]  giving the stories but whether or not it is not clear and they have hidden this
[01:55:03.520 --> 01:55:09.880]  fact and the ISI is embarrassed and Pakistan Pakistani nation is up in
[01:55:09.880 --> 01:55:14.400]  arm against the ISI in the army they look this is what we have done to us you
[01:55:14.400 --> 01:55:20.760]  have allowed invaders to come in and do things on their own and you have allowed
[01:55:20.760 --> 01:55:26.840]  the the coverage gaps why because we are investing so much money in you and
[01:55:26.840 --> 01:55:31.040]  this is what you have done to us so I think very soon there is going to be a
[01:55:31.040 --> 01:55:34.840]  policy shift as far as Pakistan is concerned because pressure is mounting
[01:55:34.840 --> 01:55:39.480]  on the regime on the government and they will have to simply say if you were to
[01:55:39.480 --> 01:55:44.320]  ask me that you have done now your job if you think that this was the target
[01:55:44.320 --> 01:55:48.640]  that you were looking for and you ravaged the whole world because of this now
[01:55:48.640 --> 01:55:54.640]  you've got him so please finish us leave us alone and Yankee please go home
[01:55:54.640 --> 01:55:59.560]  you will be also addressed to your boys and girls are being killed unnecessarily
[01:55:59.560 --> 01:56:04.320]  you are squandering your dollars one thirty five billion dollars a year for a
[01:56:04.320 --> 01:56:08.520]  heaven's sake text is money being squandered in Afghanistan on a war which
[01:56:08.520 --> 01:56:12.840]  has already been lost generally we've only got a few minutes left with you and
[01:56:12.840 --> 01:56:16.080]  that we appreciate your time general hameed ghoul joins us former head of
[01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:21.720]  Pakistani intelligence unfortunately I want to have to relate to you and the
[01:56:21.720 --> 01:56:26.000]  rest of the world that I'm monitoring liberal conservative mainline radio and
[01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:30.400]  TV and I want to give you the bad news that they are in just a matter of hours
[01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:34.240]  first it was cut the couple billion you're given that as you point out you
[01:56:34.240 --> 01:56:39.760]  spend way you know many times more trying to carry out the globalist
[01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:46.000]  dictates there in the region so our media is acting like you're our welfare
[01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:51.960]  recipients and that the money is a blessing instead of a curse given to
[01:56:51.960 --> 01:56:56.440]  you by these devilish globalist but now the drum is beginning that you need to
[01:56:56.440 --> 01:57:02.720]  be struck that you are al-qaeda that that that you run bin Laden and that you
[01:57:02.720 --> 01:57:08.280]  love the destabilization of all these people brought in and they are I want
[01:57:08.280 --> 01:57:13.160]  to confirm you need to know they are trying to get the American people ready
[01:57:13.160 --> 01:57:18.880]  to attack you and what would you like to say the American people about the
[01:57:18.880 --> 01:57:23.520]  propaganda they're hearing yes this is total propaganda this is fixing Pakistan
[01:57:23.520 --> 01:57:27.480]  who's been a long time your friend you are the sole super power today because
[01:57:27.480 --> 01:57:31.760]  of Pakistan and because of the blood of the Afghan people whom you have with
[01:57:31.760 --> 01:57:37.760]  impurity and with great callousness you have described them please don't do that
[01:57:37.760 --> 01:57:43.560]  people of America are very good they are all very innocent I think gullible
[01:57:43.560 --> 01:57:48.760]  gullibility is acceptable to an extent but please do not buy all the theories of
[01:57:48.760 --> 01:58:08.700]  these ambitious generals
