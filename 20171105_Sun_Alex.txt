[00:00.000 --> 00:13.440]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:13.440 --> 00:17.040]  I'm just an average man with an average life.
[00:17.040 --> 00:19.040]  I work from nine to five.
[00:19.040 --> 00:20.920]  Hell, I pay the price.
[00:20.920 --> 00:23.000]  Welcome to the Alex Jones show.
[00:23.000 --> 00:28.640]  This Sunday, November 5th, 2017, I am filling in for Alex temporarily here.
[00:28.640 --> 00:32.080]  I will be your host for the first hour, Owen Schroyer with you.
[00:32.080 --> 00:38.320]  We will be hearing from Alex in the second hour, as well as our reporter, actually our
[00:38.320 --> 00:45.240]  news director and sometimes reporter Rob Dew, will be boots on the ground at the scene of
[00:45.240 --> 00:49.920]  the fatal shooting at the church in Texas here today.
[00:49.920 --> 00:54.000]  Obviously, that will be the focal point of today's broadcast.
[00:54.000 --> 00:56.440]  We do have some other news we may get to.
[00:56.440 --> 01:00.840]  But let's just get you up to speed in case you are not aware.
[01:00.840 --> 01:05.400]  At least 20 people killed in a church shooting today in Texas.
[01:05.400 --> 01:12.960]  It happened just after 11 a.m. central time today, as the congregation was gathering.
[01:12.960 --> 01:16.200]  I'm hearing reports of 27 dead, but there are conflicting reports.
[01:16.200 --> 01:20.920]  These numbers do tend to change, at least 30 injured, so we'll keep you posted as we
[01:20.920 --> 01:22.000]  get those numbers in.
[01:22.000 --> 01:24.320]  I'm not sure how they can have those official numbers yet.
[01:24.320 --> 01:29.280]  But we'll continue to monitor that.
[01:29.280 --> 01:39.440]  The normal pastor of the church, the Baptist church, was not actually there today.
[01:39.440 --> 01:44.440]  His daughter was, though, and his daughter is one of the deceased, including young children
[01:44.440 --> 01:47.400]  are among the deceased as well.
[01:47.400 --> 01:51.680]  Again, a church shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas.
[01:51.680 --> 02:00.480]  There is Pastor Frank Pomeroy, who is normally the one delivering the sermon and leading
[02:00.480 --> 02:03.840]  the congregation, but was out today.
[02:03.840 --> 02:07.040]  So he was not amongst the congregation today.
[02:07.040 --> 02:11.720]  However, his daughter was, unfortunately, is among the deceased, as well as at least
[02:11.720 --> 02:14.480]  20 others.
[02:14.480 --> 02:26.880]  Now, the FBI has taken over the investigation, so not sure what that exactly means as far
[02:26.880 --> 02:33.160]  as what we're going to be told or how the investigation will be handled, so we'll continue
[02:33.160 --> 02:36.080]  to keep tabs on that as well.
[02:36.080 --> 02:39.960]  There are some interesting things, and even though we have to sit here and get through
[02:39.960 --> 02:47.680]  the grief and the realization that many people died today, but we do have to report on some
[02:47.680 --> 02:51.480]  things about it that you just don't even want to have to think about.
[02:51.480 --> 02:55.640]  But these are the things that we do here at InfoWars.
[02:55.640 --> 02:59.640]  Couple of strange things, obviously, you know, the pastor not in today.
[02:59.640 --> 03:04.080]  He has not, I've not heard a statement yet from him, not seen him on any of the television
[03:04.080 --> 03:05.080]  interviews.
[03:05.080 --> 03:08.880]  We've seen a lot of other people, eyewitnesses, etc.
[03:08.880 --> 03:13.680]  The story is, we don't have any information on the shooter either.
[03:13.680 --> 03:17.080]  They're just saying lone gunman over and over again.
[03:17.080 --> 03:25.120]  Apparently, the story is, he goes into the church, unloads, they keep saying, I keep
[03:25.120 --> 03:31.160]  hearing semi-automatic rifles, but again, we've got no details about the actual firearms
[03:31.160 --> 03:37.320]  that were used or any details as far as caliber or what type of weapon.
[03:37.320 --> 03:43.800]  They do say that the shooter paused to reload.
[03:43.800 --> 03:50.560]  So we're hearing semi-automatic weapon paused to reload at least once, and they're saying
[03:50.560 --> 03:56.160]  that he pretty much hit, or I guess we don't know if it's a he or she, but saying that
[03:56.160 --> 03:59.760]  the shooter pretty much hit everyone in the congregation.
[03:59.760 --> 04:06.320]  Now, Sutherland Springs is a town of about 500 people, so most likely this is one of
[04:06.320 --> 04:11.960]  those small towns where everybody knows everybody, all will be impacted by this, but apparently
[04:11.960 --> 04:19.560]  the shooter goes into the church, unloads a couple magazines, and then is able to get
[04:19.560 --> 04:24.680]  away from the scene, flee the scene, and drive his car away, and then apparently somehow
[04:24.680 --> 04:33.640]  was apprehended five blocks down the road, and he is now, or the shooter is now deceased.
[04:33.640 --> 04:40.240]  One interesting angle that we're looking at right now is the fact that this church records
[04:40.240 --> 04:42.600]  all of its Sunday congregations.
[04:42.600 --> 04:45.040]  Every single one of them can be found on YouTube.
[04:45.040 --> 04:51.000]  So one can only assume that the camera was rolling when this shooting happened.
[04:51.000 --> 04:52.120]  Is that the case?
[04:52.120 --> 04:54.040]  Will we ever see this footage?
[04:54.040 --> 04:55.480]  What is the FBI up to?
[04:55.480 --> 04:57.120]  We'll have more of it on the other side.
[04:57.120 --> 04:59.120]  Don't go anywhere.
[04:59.120 --> 05:06.000]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, we're running the biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling
[05:06.000 --> 05:07.840]  product, Brainforce.
[05:07.840 --> 05:13.280]  Now Brainforce Plus, there's 20% more in each bottle, and we're now purchasing so much of
[05:13.280 --> 05:17.080]  it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able
[05:17.080 --> 05:22.680]  to get it for less, so I'm offering for the first time ever 50% off, and I thought I could
[05:22.680 --> 05:24.520]  offer this for maybe a month.
[05:24.520 --> 05:30.480]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse
[05:30.480 --> 05:35.200]  because the fans of it, already you're stocking up, they know how great it is, a whole bunch
[05:35.200 --> 05:39.280]  of organic, natural, healthy, known, new tropics.
[05:39.280 --> 05:44.640]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then Brainforce is for you, and you're supporting
[05:44.640 --> 05:47.440]  the broadcast at the same time.
[05:47.440 --> 05:49.240]  It's a good deal at $39.

[06:19.240 --> 06:25.880]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[06:25.880 --> 06:29.440]  It is Sunday, November 5th, 2017.
[06:29.440 --> 06:32.000]  Filling in for Alex today, I'm Owen Schreuer.
[06:32.000 --> 06:35.680]  We will be hearing from Alex in the second hour, however.
[06:35.680 --> 06:40.880]  Alex did file some reports that are going to be key that we will be hearing in the second
[06:40.880 --> 06:41.880]  hour.
[06:41.880 --> 06:43.920]  I'll be with you for the first hour.
[06:43.920 --> 06:48.760]  We'll be keeping you updated on everything that is happening in Sutherland Springs right
[06:48.760 --> 06:55.080]  now, where there was a mass shooting, at least 20 people dead inside a church in Sutherland
[06:55.080 --> 06:57.080]  Springs, Texas.
[06:57.080 --> 07:00.480]  In the last segment, I said that I wasn't sure if it was here.
[07:00.480 --> 07:02.520]  See, they have confirmed the shooter was male.
[07:02.520 --> 07:07.360]  It's funny that we don't get any other details of the shooter that's already been reported
[07:07.360 --> 07:12.680]  as deceased, was somehow able to flee the scene, flee the church after killing at least
[07:12.680 --> 07:17.320]  20 people and shooting at least 50 people, and it's been reported that he pretty much
[07:17.320 --> 07:20.840]  shot everyone in the congregation that day.
[07:20.840 --> 07:24.560]  Pastor Palmer Roy, who normally delivers the sermon and leaves the congregation on Sundays,
[07:24.560 --> 07:26.400]  was not there this Sunday.
[07:26.400 --> 07:29.880]  His daughter, unfortunately, was among the deceased.
[07:29.880 --> 07:35.880]  This is a church that records all of their Sunday congregations.
[07:35.880 --> 07:41.520]  So one must wonder, was the camera rolling when the shooting happened?
[07:41.520 --> 07:46.840]  Here is their YouTube channel, First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, Texas.
[07:46.840 --> 07:50.040]  Was the camera recording while the shooting happened?
[07:50.040 --> 07:52.480]  Is there any footage of this shooting?
[07:52.480 --> 07:57.720]  Did the FBI confiscate what could have been possible evidence that will no longer ever
[07:57.720 --> 08:00.920]  be available to the public?
[08:00.920 --> 08:01.920]  Interesting angles there.
[08:01.920 --> 08:05.640]  We've got some other angles that we're keeping our feelers on right now, but considering
[08:05.640 --> 08:10.760]  the seriousness of this event and trying to be as accurate as possible, we're going to
[08:10.760 --> 08:13.640]  wait and flesh all of this out as details emerge.
[08:13.640 --> 08:19.080]  We are currently waiting on a press conference that is set to begin here, I would guess,
[08:19.080 --> 08:21.640]  within the next 20 minutes.
[08:21.640 --> 08:26.880]  This is from, I believe, the Sutherland Springs police station.
[08:26.880 --> 08:29.800]  I'm not sure about that, though, taking a second look with the piano there.
[08:29.800 --> 08:32.640]  I'm wondering if this might be just a local school.
[08:32.640 --> 08:37.760]  Regardless, though, there will be a press conference soon, and we will carry that live.
[08:37.760 --> 08:43.200]  So stick with us if you want to hear from the official press conference.
[08:43.200 --> 08:46.720]  I wonder if we'll be hearing from the FBI, if we'll be hearing from the local police
[08:46.720 --> 08:51.520]  department, or if we'll be seeing what we've seen in the past, the local police department
[08:51.520 --> 08:57.960]  with an FBI agent gleaming, glaring, standing over his shoulder.
[08:57.960 --> 09:00.760]  So we'll keep you posted.
[09:00.760 --> 09:04.160]  We'll just run down some of the headlines here.
[09:04.160 --> 09:07.800]  At least 27 people killed at a Texas church.
[09:07.800 --> 09:09.560]  Multiple people injured, including a two-year-old.
[09:09.560 --> 09:15.040]  So again, the numbers have reached as high as 27, as well as 30 injured in Sutherland
[09:15.040 --> 09:17.920]  Springs church shooting.
[09:17.920 --> 09:24.440]  Trump has tweeted out, as well as Vice President Mike Pence, obviously condolences and feelings
[09:24.440 --> 09:31.280]  and prayers with the people of Sutherland Springs.
[09:31.280 --> 09:33.880]  Let's go right into this.
[09:33.880 --> 09:35.400]  This is coming from the Hill.
[09:35.400 --> 09:40.960]  Dems renew calls for gun legislation in wake of Texas church shooting.
[09:40.960 --> 09:48.720]  This is actually, this is beyond politics to me, to be quite honest with you, because
[09:48.720 --> 09:56.160]  what we can report here, which is what typically happens, that the Democrats immediately politicize
[09:56.160 --> 10:00.760]  these things, they immediately blame the guns, blame the truck, don't blame the guy driving
[10:00.760 --> 10:07.600]  the truck, blame the gun, not the guy that pulled the trigger.
[10:07.600 --> 10:10.640]  But think about this.
[10:10.640 --> 10:14.800]  I'm not even going to complain about the Dems politicizing this, because we already knew
[10:14.800 --> 10:15.800]  that that was coming.
[10:15.800 --> 10:19.320]  Of course, they want to grab the guns, really shocking.
[10:19.320 --> 10:25.760]  But this is what is sick about this to me, and what the bigger issue here is.
[10:25.760 --> 10:32.280]  Folks, think of how many lives could have been saved today if one person in that congregation
[10:32.280 --> 10:39.600]  was carrying, if one person had his concealed carry permit and had a pistol on his hip today.
[10:39.600 --> 10:40.600]  What about two people?
[10:40.600 --> 10:47.120]  What if there were three, four people, four good Americans, members of the congregation
[10:47.120 --> 10:51.840]  carrying their firearms with their concealed carry, which you have to have training to
[10:51.840 --> 10:57.840]  get, you have to know how to shoot a pistol at short range, imagine if you had just one
[10:57.840 --> 11:04.840]  though, just one, just one American citizen in that church that had his concealed carry.
[11:04.840 --> 11:09.040]  How many lives could have been saved today?
[11:09.040 --> 11:13.720]  So do the Democrats really not have this common sense?
[11:13.720 --> 11:15.440]  Wow, here's another one.
[11:15.440 --> 11:22.280]  Oh my gosh, this story was just published by Mallory Shelbourne on the Hill.
[11:22.280 --> 11:26.680]  House Democrats slam NRA in wake of Texas shooting.
[11:26.680 --> 11:34.200]  Now, again, folks, like I said, this just shows the Democrats true colors.
[11:34.200 --> 11:39.160]  When we say that they want the guns, they want the guns.
[11:39.160 --> 11:40.720]  Here's Kamala Harris.
[11:40.720 --> 11:48.320]  Kamala Harris condemns senseless gun violence after Texas church shooting.
[11:48.320 --> 11:50.080]  So this is what we're saying.
[11:50.080 --> 11:51.800]  They really do want your guns, folks.
[11:51.800 --> 12:01.200]  They really want to come for your guns, totalitarians, authoritarians, communists have to take your
[12:01.200 --> 12:02.200]  guns.
[12:02.200 --> 12:11.200]  So you can't have a weapon, you can't have a firearm and be a slave.
[12:11.200 --> 12:17.840]  You can't be under thumb of a big government when you're armed.
[12:17.840 --> 12:20.760]  That's the entire point.
[12:20.760 --> 12:28.000]  So when we go out to, you look at yesterday's protest in Austin and you've got hundreds
[12:28.000 --> 12:33.440]  of Americans out there, open carrying, executing their Second Amendment right.
[12:33.440 --> 12:36.920]  By the way, don't tell Don Lemon or Jake Tapper, but guess what?
[12:36.920 --> 12:39.280]  No one got shot.
[12:39.280 --> 12:41.000]  Wow.
[12:41.000 --> 12:44.000]  Imagine that.
[12:44.000 --> 12:50.080]  Hundreds of people on the streets of Austin yesterday with all kinds of different firearms,
[12:50.080 --> 12:57.440]  zero, zero people got shot, zero times with a firearm discharged.
[12:57.440 --> 13:07.040]  And here are the Democrats the next day blaming guns for what happened at the church.
[13:07.040 --> 13:16.520]  So this shows their true colors that they really want to come for the guns.
[13:16.520 --> 13:22.240]  And that's the first thing they think of when an event like this happens is, oh, how can
[13:22.240 --> 13:26.800]  we virtue signal and grab the guns?
[13:26.800 --> 13:30.120]  That's what they do.
[13:30.120 --> 13:41.400]  And it really just shows their mental makeup that instead of the just their agenda to grab
[13:41.400 --> 13:46.840]  the guns, their agenda to target the Second Amendment, their agenda to blame guns, their
[13:46.840 --> 13:51.360]  agenda to blame the gun owners of America, their agenda to blame the NRA, their agenda
[13:51.360 --> 13:58.840]  to demonize anyone that has a firearm, their agenda to demonize, blame with any angle guns
[13:58.840 --> 14:06.480]  and gun owners is at the top of their priority so that it supersedes common sense, which
[14:06.480 --> 14:14.360]  is if there was one good citizen there with a gun, multiple lives could have been saved.
[14:14.360 --> 14:19.920]  So what does that tell you about people like Kamala Harris?
[14:19.920 --> 14:31.680]  That common sense decency and the Constitution are all put on the back burner for the agenda
[14:31.680 --> 14:36.480]  to grab the guns, demonize the Second Amendment and demonize gun owners.
[14:36.480 --> 14:38.920]  There's the tweet from Kamala Harris folks.
[14:38.920 --> 14:45.320]  This is approximately two hours after the shooting happened.
[14:45.320 --> 14:49.880]  Kamala Harris tweets out, senseless gun violence has torn apart another community.
[14:49.880 --> 14:55.880]  This time in a house of worship, when do we say enough is enough?
[14:55.880 --> 14:58.040]  I think it's enough of Kamala Harris.
[14:58.040 --> 15:03.720]  That's what I think it's enough of you and it's enough of you demonizing guns.
[15:03.720 --> 15:12.760]  And here's another thing folks, yesterday after the march was over, there were a lot
[15:12.760 --> 15:13.760]  of patriots.
[15:13.760 --> 15:17.560]  Honestly, I want to thank all the patriots out there because I know that a lot of you
[15:17.560 --> 15:21.560]  have my back when I'm out there and you're watching out for us.
[15:21.560 --> 15:26.360]  And some of them were kind of following me after the deal as I was searching for some
[15:26.360 --> 15:30.520]  of these protesters to get an interview with them that were protected by the police.
[15:30.520 --> 15:36.520]  And so we're walking up the block and a couple girls walk out, four girls walk out of the
[15:36.520 --> 15:41.600]  coffee shop and they literally shrieked when they saw a gun.
[15:41.600 --> 15:45.520]  They literally shrieked in horror and ran across the street.
[15:45.520 --> 15:46.880]  I'm not kidding you.
[15:46.880 --> 15:48.200]  They didn't even look both ways.
[15:48.200 --> 15:49.640]  They could have been hit by a car.
[15:49.640 --> 15:55.360]  But the sight of a gun scared them so much that they had to flee the scene even though
[15:55.360 --> 16:00.240]  if there was a man with a gun, lives could have been saved today.

[18:09.200 --> 18:13.280]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[18:13.280 --> 18:17.600]  Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[18:17.600 --> 18:22.920]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[18:22.920 --> 18:29.320]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfoWarsLife.com.
[18:29.320 --> 18:34.440]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn
[18:34.440 --> 18:36.560]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[18:36.560 --> 18:38.160]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee.
[18:38.160 --> 18:43.480]  And it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[18:43.480 --> 18:48.280]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[18:48.280 --> 18:51.360]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[18:51.360 --> 18:56.280]  You will be supporting a free press all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of
[18:56.280 --> 18:58.040]  my favorite coffee.
[18:58.040 --> 18:59.920]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[18:59.920 --> 19:01.920]  I want to plow into all of this.
[19:01.920 --> 19:09.200]  I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that
[19:09.200 --> 19:15.240]  when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books or videos or other material
[19:15.240 --> 19:19.880]  from InfoWarsStore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[19:19.880 --> 19:22.080]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[19:22.080 --> 19:25.680]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[19:25.680 --> 19:29.480]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best chloride-free toothpaste
[19:29.480 --> 19:33.360]  with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[19:33.360 --> 19:35.760]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[19:35.760 --> 19:39.880]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones, that's my dad, the colloidal silver
[19:39.880 --> 19:45.600]  and iodine as well, InfoWarsLife.com, or triple-A-253-3139.
[19:45.600 --> 19:50.040]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump,
[19:50.040 --> 19:52.880]  stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[19:52.880 --> 19:56.000]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back
[19:56.000 --> 20:03.000]  against us so we need your support.
[20:03.000 --> 20:19.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:19.200 --> 20:41.280]  Trashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[20:41.280 --> 20:49.160]  It's being reported 27 dead after a church was shot up in Sutherland Springs, Texas.
[20:49.160 --> 20:52.280]  Our very own Rob Dew is almost there.
[20:52.280 --> 20:55.280]  He will be reporting from the ground in the second hour.
[20:55.280 --> 21:01.200]  We will also be hearing from Alex Jones in the second hour, and we are currently waiting
[21:01.200 --> 21:05.640]  for the press conference from Sutherland Springs, which is actually at a community
[21:05.640 --> 21:08.280]  center there in the small town.
[21:08.280 --> 21:14.400]  I want to pull up this map for a second, guys, just so we can kind of show the people where
[21:14.400 --> 21:15.400]  this happened.
[21:15.400 --> 21:21.720]  I'm not familiar with these two roads, but I'm told it's kind of in the middle of 87
[21:21.720 --> 21:27.560]  and 593, is that right, guys, 539 and 87.
[21:27.560 --> 21:37.400]  And this is, well, it's just east, pretty much, of San Antonio, just south here of Austin.
[21:37.400 --> 21:40.840]  Now they're zooming out now so you can get a better idea.
[21:40.840 --> 21:49.600]  There you can see it just a bit southeast of San Antonio.
[21:49.600 --> 21:56.160]  Now here's something strange, and I mean, you know, get your conspiracy theories ready.
[21:56.160 --> 22:02.840]  But of all of the streets in Sutherland Springs, there's only one street corner where you cannot
[22:02.840 --> 22:08.360]  get a street view, and that is right in front of the church.
[22:08.360 --> 22:14.480]  So I don't know if that's of any significance, I don't know why that would be the case.
[22:14.480 --> 22:15.480]  Did they change that?
[22:15.480 --> 22:18.160]  Can you now have a street view of this church?
[22:18.160 --> 22:21.000]  Because you couldn't earlier.
[22:21.000 --> 22:22.000]  Interesting.
[22:22.000 --> 22:28.240]  Well, there you go, there you can see the site of the shooting today.
[22:28.240 --> 22:31.200]  I guess it's like jumping over that spot, isn't it, right there?
[22:31.200 --> 22:34.000]  It's jumping over that intersection, isn't it?
[22:34.000 --> 22:35.000]  Yeah.
[22:35.000 --> 22:36.000]  Okay.
[22:36.000 --> 22:38.720]  I don't know what that's about, but obviously people were trying to get a Google Street
[22:38.720 --> 22:46.000]  view of the actual intersection where the church is located and Google Street view does
[22:46.000 --> 22:47.120]  not allow you to do that.
[22:47.120 --> 22:49.720]  It makes you jump right over that intersection.
[22:49.720 --> 22:55.360]  So just thought that was worth reporting for whatever it's worth.
[22:55.360 --> 22:59.320]  Now the FBI, it's been said, is taking over the investigation.
[22:59.320 --> 23:01.200]  We are waiting for the press conference.
[23:01.200 --> 23:03.960]  We will carry that live.
[23:03.960 --> 23:11.440]  But just look at all the Democrats that are already calling for gun control after this
[23:11.440 --> 23:13.880]  event.
[23:13.880 --> 23:16.680]  Truly sad.
[23:16.680 --> 23:18.120]  Truly sad.
[23:18.120 --> 23:30.480]  The typical candidates, Kamala Harris, Mike Thompson, Richard Blumenthal, Dick Durbin.
[23:30.480 --> 23:39.440]  So you have to ask yourself, folks, are these politicians so agenda driven to come after
[23:39.440 --> 23:48.560]  guns, come after the Second Amendment, that they prioritize the agenda to get rid of guns
[23:48.560 --> 23:53.360]  and to get rid of the Second Amendment higher than common sense?
[23:53.360 --> 23:55.440]  That is the question I'm asking these Democrats.
[23:55.440 --> 24:00.600]  Do you really put your agenda, your anti-gun agenda above common sense?
[24:00.600 --> 24:03.400]  Because that's what you're doing today.
[24:03.400 --> 24:08.760]  And you're doing it really within hours of the event happening.
[24:08.760 --> 24:12.520]  So they don't even wait a day now to hop right on this deal.
[24:12.520 --> 24:14.760]  That's how desperate they are.
[24:14.760 --> 24:20.840]  But when you completely forego common sense in order to push your political agenda, now
[24:20.840 --> 24:25.280]  you really have to wonder what these people are.
[24:25.280 --> 24:31.520]  Why is this gun, this anti-gun agenda so important to these people that they can't even deal
[24:31.520 --> 24:33.440]  in common sense?
[24:33.440 --> 24:34.440]  What am I talking about?
[24:34.440 --> 24:36.080]  What is the common sense here?
[24:36.080 --> 24:49.840]  50 people in a church, apparently 50 unarmed people all get shot by reportedly a lone gunman.
[24:49.840 --> 24:55.800]  Let's say that you had one citizen in that church that had his concealed carry and was
[24:55.800 --> 25:01.520]  carrying today when the shooter entered the building and started shooting.
[25:01.520 --> 25:05.240]  Well, there would have been a fight, wouldn't there have been?
[25:05.240 --> 25:10.440]  There would have been a little pushback and the shooter wouldn't have been able to go
[25:10.440 --> 25:14.240]  in there and shoot unabated.
[25:14.240 --> 25:20.800]  But that isn't the thought process of these Democrats.
[25:20.800 --> 25:26.760]  It's oh my gosh, if only we could have gotten rid of the gun in the first place.
[25:26.760 --> 25:29.400]  If only we could have signed that legislation.
[25:29.400 --> 25:31.720]  If only the NRA didn't exist.
[25:31.720 --> 25:35.760]  If only we could have pushed through all of our anti-gun legislation years ago.
[25:35.760 --> 25:39.360]  If only the Republicans didn't stand up for the Second Amendment.
[25:39.360 --> 25:44.600]  If only, if only, if only these people live in an if only world.
[25:44.600 --> 25:46.800]  They don't even live in reality.
[25:46.800 --> 25:55.840]  No, the real if only folks is if only one or two members of that congregation would have
[25:55.840 --> 26:01.080]  had their concealed carry and a pistol on them today.
[26:01.080 --> 26:04.920]  Multiple lives would have been saved.
[26:04.920 --> 26:09.680]  Probably 100% without a doubt.
[26:09.680 --> 26:13.240]  Now here's a video from the church's YouTube channel.
[26:13.240 --> 26:16.960]  They do record all of their Sunday congregations.
[26:16.960 --> 26:24.080]  So this begs the question, was the camera rolling and recording when this shooting happened,
[26:24.080 --> 26:26.640]  when the shooter entered the grounds?
[26:26.640 --> 26:30.120]  And if so, what comes of that footage?
[26:30.120 --> 26:33.160]  Does the FBI hide it forever?
[26:33.160 --> 26:35.320]  Has the FBI already confiscated it?
[26:35.320 --> 26:39.920]  Does the church have any say in their own intellectual property?
[26:39.920 --> 26:42.720]  Or does the FBI get to control that?
[26:42.720 --> 26:46.920]  That's what we will find out as we are waiting on the press conference.
[26:46.920 --> 26:51.040]  But here you can see the first Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs YouTube channel.
[26:51.040 --> 26:53.560]  They do upload all of their sermons.
[26:53.560 --> 26:59.680]  And I will tell you, obviously, these views have skyrocketed just since we've been on
[26:59.680 --> 27:04.320]  air, where most of these videos were at about 200, 300 views.
[27:04.320 --> 27:08.680]  Now you can see the most recent up over 2,000.
[27:08.680 --> 27:13.760]  And obviously, everyone's concern is with the people of this community.
[27:13.760 --> 27:20.760]  It's going to be tough going to school tomorrow, I'm sure, for this community.
[27:20.760 --> 27:28.800]  It's going to be tough going to church even in this community and the other local churches.
[27:28.800 --> 27:36.760]  But I wonder, because see, I have a feeling that the people in this community are thinking,
[27:36.760 --> 27:39.520]  I'm going to take my gun with me from now on.
[27:39.520 --> 27:45.120]  I don't think the members of this congregation now, they can speak for themselves, but I
[27:45.120 --> 27:50.000]  feel like the first gut instinct reaction to this was, oh my gosh, I wish there was more
[27:50.000 --> 27:51.000]  gun control.
[27:51.000 --> 27:53.480]  Oh my gosh, I wish there was more gun legislation.
[27:53.480 --> 27:58.200]  Oh my gosh, I wish the Democrats shut down the NRA and shut down the Second Amendment.
[27:58.200 --> 28:04.880]  Because people still live in reality and they know that millions and millions of guns have
[28:04.880 --> 28:08.760]  already hit the market and they don't go anywhere, folks.
[28:08.760 --> 28:12.040]  Guns are very durable and they stick around.
[28:12.040 --> 28:17.040]  Those guns aren't going anywhere and no matter what legislation any government wants to pass,
[28:17.040 --> 28:22.440]  those guns will still be on the street and criminals will still break the law.
[28:22.440 --> 28:25.440]  What was that last story, guys, as we go to break?
[28:25.440 --> 28:32.720]  Yep, Democrat Senator calls for gun control after shooting before shooter even identified.
[28:32.720 --> 28:41.080]  Again, it just shows you, folks, the agenda to take the guns, the anti-gun agenda, the
[28:41.080 --> 28:47.280]  anti-Second Amendment agenda is more important to these people than common sense.
[28:47.280 --> 28:53.120]  They've shown their true colors, we aren't conspiracy theorists, they really do want
[28:53.120 --> 28:54.120]  the guns.
[28:54.120 --> 28:58.080]  If they want you to have a gun, what do you think happens when they take the guns more
[28:58.080 --> 28:59.080]  church shootings?
[28:59.080 --> 29:05.400]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality Info Wars biome defense
[29:05.400 --> 29:06.960]  probiotic.
[29:06.960 --> 29:13.680]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have
[29:13.680 --> 29:21.360]  been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[29:21.360 --> 29:26.320]  Biome defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over
[29:26.320 --> 29:33.000]  23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[29:33.000 --> 29:37.560]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading
[29:37.560 --> 29:40.080]  probiotic on the market.
[29:40.080 --> 29:45.160]  Secure your biome defense in ultra strength or regular strength at InfoWarsLife.com today
[29:45.160 --> 29:48.760]  and get started supporting your digestive system naturally.
[29:48.760 --> 29:52.320]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first round of the
[29:52.320 --> 30:00.960]  public, so please take advantage of it today, support your own health and support the InfoWars.
[30:00.960 --> 30:03.840]  America is an information based civil war.
[30:03.840 --> 30:07.560]  That's why now more than ever, we've got to hit the streets of America and let these
[30:07.560 --> 30:11.240]  globalists scum know we're not backing down from their bullying.
[30:11.240 --> 30:17.600]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[30:17.600 --> 30:23.600]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian or simply a free speech advocate is truly
[30:23.600 --> 30:24.600]  the counterculture.
[30:24.600 --> 30:31.360]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism and pro-freedom
[30:31.360 --> 30:34.080]  who at the same time is tolerant.
[30:34.080 --> 30:38.880]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Geverson's class of liberalism.
[30:38.880 --> 30:44.240]  They are the anti-liberalists who defend free speech, meet like-minded friends and promote
[30:44.240 --> 30:45.240]  freedom worldwide.
[30:45.240 --> 30:50.720]  We've got more than 60 original designs of high quality t-shirts for men and women as
[30:50.720 --> 30:54.400]  well as more Patriot Apparel at infowarstore.com.

[30:59.440 --> 31:03.600]  My fellow freedom lovers, Alex Jones here with a very important message.
[31:03.600 --> 31:09.040]  Secret 12, 40% off the best vitamin B12 out there from our research, take it under the
[31:09.040 --> 31:10.720]  tongue, simply amazing.
[31:10.720 --> 31:16.800]  That sale is continuing, supermelt, vitality for stamina, libido, energy, that's 30% off,
[31:16.800 --> 31:17.800]  that's continuing.
[31:17.800 --> 31:22.440]  And the other really, really good news is that yes, we're having to end the sale of 50%
[31:22.440 --> 31:28.920]  off on Anthroplex, but DNA force after almost four months out of stock is back in stock,
[31:28.920 --> 31:31.720]  25% off our flagship product.
[31:31.720 --> 31:36.360]  Also biome, defense, the great probiotic, that is 25% off as well.
[31:36.360 --> 31:40.800]  So a lot of things are selling out, but a lot of things are still at record sales.
[31:40.800 --> 31:45.720]  Like silver bullets, super high quality colloidal silver is still 50% off and there's other
[31:45.720 --> 31:49.200]  sales that are still going, but they're all about to end.
[31:49.200 --> 31:54.520]  Whether it's DNA force or whether it's silver bullet, it's all available right now at infowarslife.com
[31:54.520 --> 31:58.080]  or by calling toll free, triple A 253-3139.
[31:58.080 --> 32:05.160]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still

[32:29.360 --> 32:34.360]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating,

[33:03.040 --> 33:10.040]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:10.040 --> 33:28.040]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:28.040 --> 33:54.120]  Well, I've got it because it's simply the truth.
[33:54.120 --> 33:58.640]  Harvest Rights are now calling for more church shootings.
[33:58.640 --> 34:00.640]  That's what they're doing today.
[34:00.640 --> 34:06.520]  Yes, go ahead, tell your friends, tell your family.
[34:06.520 --> 34:09.080]  Dems aren't calling for gun control, folks.
[34:09.080 --> 34:13.600]  You can't control an inanimate object, it doesn't do anything.
[34:13.600 --> 34:17.360]  You can sit the gun down on the table, there's your gun control.
[34:17.360 --> 34:21.720]  It's not going anywhere, it's not shooting anybody, it's doing nothing.
[34:21.720 --> 34:27.800]  Dems aren't calling for gun control today, folks, in wake of the church shooting in Sutherland,
[34:27.800 --> 34:28.800]  Springs, Texas.
[34:28.800 --> 34:31.040]  No, Dems aren't calling for gun control.
[34:31.040 --> 34:34.400]  That's a misnomer, that's a misleading headline.
[34:34.400 --> 34:40.200]  What Dems are calling for today is more church shootings.
[34:40.200 --> 34:42.240]  That's the truth.
[34:42.240 --> 34:44.720]  That's what the Dems are calling for.
[34:44.720 --> 34:51.680]  More church shootings, more innocent victims, more tyranny, more criminals roaming the streets.
[34:51.680 --> 34:57.920]  Less of you being able to defend yourself.
[34:57.920 --> 35:00.320]  That's what the Dems are calling for today.
[35:00.320 --> 35:09.480]  No gun legislation, zero, zippity-doodle, could have stopped what happened today.
[35:09.480 --> 35:15.200]  No gun control legislation could have stopped what happened in Vegas.
[35:15.200 --> 35:17.160]  But the Democrats don't understand that, do they?
[35:17.160 --> 35:20.160]  They don't understand the concept that criminals break the law.
[35:20.160 --> 35:23.520]  It's funny that they wouldn't understand that, considering most of them are criminals.
[35:23.520 --> 35:26.840]  You'd think they would understand that mindset, but it seems to skip them.
[35:26.840 --> 35:29.480]  Here's Senator Bob Casey.
[35:29.480 --> 35:33.000]  In addition to offering my prayers and thoughts, I also believe Congress must take action on
[35:33.000 --> 35:34.560]  gun violence.
[35:34.560 --> 35:35.920]  Really?
[35:35.920 --> 35:39.720]  How do you take action on gun violence?
[35:39.720 --> 35:42.080]  I think we already have actions for gun violence.
[35:42.080 --> 35:48.880]  Senator Bob Casey, it's called arrest, it's called a justice system.
[35:48.880 --> 35:53.040]  And again, you know, actually this is amazing.
[35:53.040 --> 35:58.080]  There were, of all of the footage that I went through of the Vegas shooting, just the people
[35:58.080 --> 36:03.280]  shooting on their cell phones, do you realize how many times you could hear people in these
[36:03.280 --> 36:06.240]  videos saying, I wish I brought my gun?
[36:06.240 --> 36:10.720]  Do you realize how many people were fleeing the scene saying, dang it, why didn't I bring
[36:10.720 --> 36:11.960]  my gun today?
[36:11.960 --> 36:17.800]  I mean, what do you think you wish you had when somebody walks into your church and starts
[36:17.800 --> 36:18.800]  shooting?
[36:18.800 --> 36:25.200]  The first thing you want is, do you think the first thing you wish for is gun legislation?
[36:25.200 --> 36:30.640]  Oh my gosh, there's a shooter in my church, gun legislation, we need gun legislation.
[36:30.640 --> 36:35.160]  Or do you think it's, oh my gosh, there's a shooter in my church, I wish I had a gun.
[36:35.160 --> 36:42.160]  And if you had a gun, you'd be reaching for the gun and you'd be pulling out and you'd
[36:42.160 --> 36:46.760]  be putting your training into execution and you'd take down the shooter and then you'd
[36:46.760 --> 36:50.960]  be a hero, but you're not allowed to be a hero.
[36:50.960 --> 36:53.640]  You're not allowed to defend yourself, you're not allowed to defend your church, no, the
[36:53.640 --> 36:58.120]  Democrats are going to do that for you by taking the guns, see?
[36:58.120 --> 37:04.040]  And it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter that all these people usually acquire these firearms
[37:04.040 --> 37:08.880]  illegally to begin with, it doesn't matter that there's already millions and millions
[37:08.880 --> 37:15.960]  of guns out on the streets already, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter that the government,
[37:15.960 --> 37:20.440]  the FBI, the CIA have already been caught running guns illegally, none of that matters,
[37:20.440 --> 37:27.120]  we need more gun control, that's what the Democrats said.
[37:27.120 --> 37:32.440]  So congratulations to all the Democrats that showed their true colors today and called
[37:32.440 --> 37:40.800]  for gun control after an event where if there would have been a citizen on the scene with
[37:40.800 --> 37:47.520]  a gun, a good citizen with a gun, with his concealed carry, multiple lives would have
[37:47.520 --> 37:52.120]  been saved today, that is undoubtable.
[37:52.120 --> 37:59.680]  We are currently waiting right now for the press conference in Sutherland Springs, Texas,
[37:59.680 --> 38:05.840]  but let that sink in folks, this is the truth, this is the truth, the Democrats, they are
[38:05.840 --> 38:10.520]  not calling for gun control, they're calling for more church shootings.
[38:10.520 --> 38:14.520]  That's how we spin this, that's how we put this right back on them.
[38:14.520 --> 38:20.240]  You want to call for gun control, we'll call it what it really is, more church shootings.
[38:20.240 --> 38:26.700]  Yeah, Dick Durbin tweets out, this guy is such a piece of work, the shooter turned his
[38:26.700 --> 38:30.420]  gun on people, kids in a place of worship, since when did these people care about place
[38:30.420 --> 38:34.640]  of worship if it's not a Muslim, America is in the grips of gun violence crisis, really
[38:34.640 --> 38:39.000]  actually the numbers are down unless you're in Chicago, a gun free zone, Congress must
[38:39.000 --> 38:46.320]  act, again, what could Congress have done for the people in that church folks, this
[38:46.320 --> 38:52.000]  is how loony these people are, this is how deranged and agenda driven these people are,
[38:52.000 --> 38:58.400]  that they sacrifice and forfeit common sense for the agenda.
[38:58.400 --> 39:04.480]  Can you pull up Dick Durbin's tweet again for me real quick?
[39:04.480 --> 39:10.960]  Dick Durbin says, America is in the grips of a gun violence crisis, these same Democrats
[39:10.960 --> 39:18.000]  who will say we're in the grips of a gun violence crisis will never ever once say anything
[39:18.000 --> 39:21.160]  about radical Islamic terror.
[39:21.160 --> 39:26.960]  This is the Democrat mind, radical Islamic terror doesn't exist, in fact, we've got
[39:26.960 --> 39:33.480]  a clip from Fareed Zakaria, you know what, let's go to this clip right now, let's go
[39:33.480 --> 39:39.760]  to Fareed Zakaria, because it's all the same mindset folks, it's all the same deranged
[39:39.760 --> 39:46.360]  mindset, here's Fareed Zakaria apologizing for radical Islamic terror.
[39:46.360 --> 39:50.660]  This week's tragic terror attack in New York was the kind of isolated incident by one
[39:50.660 --> 39:59.920]  troubled man that shouldn't lead to grand generalization, pause it right there, one isolated event,
[39:59.920 --> 40:05.800]  he tells you, Fareed Zakaria on fake news CNN, tells you one isolated event, no one
[40:05.800 --> 40:09.320]  has ever said Allah al-Akhbar and stabbed anyone ever before, oh wait, it's happened
[40:09.320 --> 40:12.880]  dozens of times, no one's ever said Allah al-Akhbar and run people over on the streets
[40:12.880 --> 40:16.760]  with a vehicle, oh wait, that's happened in multiple countries, and then here's Fareed
[40:16.760 --> 40:21.240]  Zakaria telling you it's a lone event, but then he discredits himself with what he says
[40:21.240 --> 40:37.680]  next, pause it right there, he says it's a lone event, then references 9-11 and references
[40:37.680 --> 40:45.800]  jihadi events, so he contradicts his own self in this clip, folks, I'm telling you, you
[40:45.800 --> 40:51.600]  have to ask yourself, are these people that corrupt or are they really that stupid?
[40:51.600 --> 40:56.080]  I mean, Fareed Zakaria, I mean forget the fact he looks like the clown out of the Saw
[40:56.080 --> 41:05.320]  movie series, but don't you see folks, oh so again, a guy runs people over, chants Allah
[41:05.320 --> 41:12.120]  al-Akhbar, and then Fareed Zakaria says this is just a lone event, this is just a lone
[41:12.120 --> 41:17.680]  event, we shouldn't generalize people because of a lone event, then references 9-11 when
[41:17.680 --> 41:24.520]  we went to war against radical Islamic terror because they hate our way of life, he doesn't
[41:24.520 --> 41:29.320]  mention that because that would go against his theory that this was a lone event, Rob
[41:29.320 --> 41:34.880]  Dew has just entered the scene at the press conference in Sutherland Springs, he just
[41:34.880 --> 41:41.080]  flashed across the camera, but don't you see how this thought pattern is the same for
[41:41.080 --> 41:44.280]  all of them?
[41:44.280 --> 41:47.600]  You can't offend anyone, you don't even want to offend anyone because you're scared of
[41:47.600 --> 41:52.320]  your own shadow, you're so politically correct and scared of your own shadow that you can't
[41:52.320 --> 42:02.720]  even report the truth, but then it shows how one narrow visioned you are in your own PC
[42:02.720 --> 42:11.720]  mind, censored mind that you refute your own statement in the very next statement.
[42:11.720 --> 42:19.720]  So that's enough of Fareed Zakaria for now, and notice also, so you have all these radical
[42:19.720 --> 42:28.040]  Islamic terrorist acts, no calls for immigration control, no calls for control over the visa
[42:28.040 --> 42:34.200]  diversity program, doesn't matter how many immigrants stab one, how about this one, deadly
[42:34.200 --> 42:39.200]  Tennessee church shooting, Sudanese immigrant arrested, FBI launches civil rights investigation,
[42:39.200 --> 42:44.640]  a black Sudanese immigrant shoots up people in a church, the mainstream media ignores
[42:44.640 --> 42:49.920]  it, no call for immigration control by the Democrats, it's guns, guns, guns, guns, so
[42:49.920 --> 42:55.520]  today the Democrats called for more church shootings in America in their agenda to take
[42:55.520 --> 42:58.360]  the Second Amendment, we will not stand for it.

[45:12.520 --> 45:18.800]  60 years ago when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums
[45:18.800 --> 45:24.360]  of their own, air raid sirens, but in the 21st century there are silent weapons for
[45:24.360 --> 45:30.040]  quiet war, pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy

[50:53.920 --> 50:59.720]  a few years ago when I would go to the infowarsstore, the selection was probably a quarter of what
[50:59.720 --> 51:04.960]  it is now, we have seriously expanded our store and we plan to continue that expansion
[51:04.960 --> 51:10.320]  as we are expanding our broadcast here with your support at infowarsstore.com, so be sure

[51:14.720 --> 51:25.040]  out, alright, we're still keeping tabs on Rob Dew as he is at the community center in
[51:25.040 --> 51:31.400]  Sutherland Springs, Texas where they're about to give a press conference, so a crew, if
[51:31.400 --> 51:34.880]  you guys could just keep me posted on that situation, it looks like they're still building
[51:34.880 --> 51:40.480]  the scene there, they're still getting some mics set up, oh there's Rob Dew, he enters
[51:40.480 --> 51:47.080]  the fold here, I think Rob is either live now or about to go live, that's Rob Dew there
[51:47.080 --> 51:53.680]  sitting right in front of the camera, so Rob Dew is obviously covering this live himself,
[51:53.680 --> 51:59.600]  guys is that on our Facebook channel, I'm gonna have the crew back there get the exact
[51:59.600 --> 52:03.760]  area where you can find that of all of our things, of course we've got the Twitter, real
[52:03.760 --> 52:09.320]  Alex Jones, infowars, we've got the Facebook, we've got the YouTube, we've got everything
[52:09.320 --> 52:16.120]  folks and trying to figure out where you can find Rob Dew's live coverage of that.
[52:16.120 --> 52:21.280]  So Rob Dew is live somewhere right now, there he is right there, okay so you can find Rob
[52:21.280 --> 52:27.440]  Dew's broadcast also on the Alex Jones channel on Facebook, so we'll be covering that as
[52:27.440 --> 52:36.640]  well as hearing from Alex himself in the next hour, so be sure to stay tuned to that.
[52:36.640 --> 52:41.720]  I want to mention one thing, I touched on this in a segment earlier, now this is actually
[52:41.720 --> 52:46.800]  a story from September, most people have probably never even heard about this story.
[52:46.800 --> 52:50.760]  Deadly Tennessee church shooting, Sudanese immigrant arrested, FBI launches civil rights
[52:50.760 --> 52:57.160]  investigation, so this shooter went into a small town church in Tennessee, Emmanuel
[52:57.160 --> 53:06.440]  King got a Samson from Sudan and shot up the church, but it was never reported, you never
[53:06.440 --> 53:11.280]  saw a lick of this on television news, now this story is from Fox News but folks I'm telling
[53:11.280 --> 53:15.880]  you I'm honoring all Fox News, even Fox News barely even gave this any attention on their
[53:15.880 --> 53:27.400]  television shows, and today when they're all going back remembering all of the mass shootings
[53:27.400 --> 53:36.040]  that have happened, they mentioned the Vegas shooting, they mentioned the shooting of the
[53:36.040 --> 53:39.400]  young guy that went into the church, I think that was in Charlottesville, I can't even remember
[53:39.400 --> 53:44.120]  there's so many, was that Charlotte, I can't even recall the guy's name now either, but
[53:44.120 --> 53:49.480]  they mentioned all of these shootings and somehow they just left this one out, they
[53:49.480 --> 53:57.200]  just magically, magically just left this one out of the Sudanese immigrant going into the
[53:57.200 --> 54:04.120]  church and shooting people, why, I wonder why they left that out, so that was strange
[54:04.120 --> 54:10.600]  to me and I wanted to pull that story today because I noticed that none of the news reporting
[54:10.600 --> 54:14.600]  is reporting on this story, which you would think you would report on, it's right along
[54:14.600 --> 54:20.080]  the lines to church shooting, to gunmen, but they don't report on it, I wonder if that's
[54:20.080 --> 54:30.080]  because the killer in that situation was a immigrant from Sudan, I'm not sure but nobody
[54:30.080 --> 54:37.000]  is mentioning that, so again folks if you're just joining us, the big news today is being
[54:37.000 --> 54:46.080]  reported 27 people have died in a mass shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas and at least
[54:46.080 --> 54:50.680]  30 others injured, the Democrats are already calling for guns, that's how it's being reported,
[54:50.680 --> 54:54.760]  the Democrats are actually calling for more short shootings because they don't want you
[54:54.760 --> 55:00.120]  to be able to defend yourself in your church if somebody like this came in and started
[55:00.120 --> 55:06.360]  shooting, note the answer is learn how to use a gun, get your concealed carry and protect
[55:06.360 --> 55:10.840]  yourself when you're in a situation like this, and they always ignore the fact, the Democrats
[55:10.840 --> 55:16.360]  always ignore the fact that in the gun free zones, just use Chicago as an example, more
[55:16.360 --> 55:21.520]  shootings than in any other city, more gun violence than anywhere else is in the gun
[55:21.520 --> 55:28.440]  free zones in Chicago, amazing how gun free zones don't seem to stay gun free.
[55:28.440 --> 55:33.080]  Alright, well I'll tell you what we're going to do here, I'm going to just hit a couple
[55:33.080 --> 55:37.240]  other headlines before this news conference gets started and before we hear from Alex
[55:37.240 --> 55:45.200]  Jones on the other side, you know, Weinstein Gate continues to crumble, this was a story
[55:45.200 --> 55:51.320]  from Business Insider today, all the men who have accused Kevin Spacey of sexual misconduct,
[55:51.320 --> 55:57.600]  it started with Anthony Rapp saying he was assaulted by Spacey when he was 14, now there's
[55:57.600 --> 56:05.440]  a whole list of them and I've even heard reports that Spacey is seeking pedophilia therapy,
[56:05.440 --> 56:07.760]  think about that.
[56:07.760 --> 56:13.360]  Now if you asked one Alex Jones what pedophilia therapy would be, he would point to a ball
[56:13.360 --> 56:21.360]  peen hammer upside the head, but somehow Spacey, you know, I'm a pedophile, I just have a problem,
[56:21.360 --> 56:30.120]  I just need therapy, no dude you are a sick, sick man that actually acted out your pedophilic
[56:30.120 --> 56:36.440]  desires, that's what people are saying, you don't go to therapy for that, you get arrested
[56:36.440 --> 56:40.600]  I guess unless you're Kevin Spacey, but I have a bad feeling that this is only going
[56:40.600 --> 56:46.520]  to get worse for Kevin Spacey and for Hollywood, I don't know if you've heard about this one
[56:46.520 --> 56:54.800]  yet, but Rand Paul's neighbor decided to beat him up, Rand Paul, I mean you want to talk
[56:54.800 --> 57:02.000]  about really a centrist, libertarian centrist, you got to think about Rand Paul, but his
[57:02.000 --> 57:10.240]  neighbor Renee Boucher decided he was going to assault him and try to beat him up, so
[57:10.240 --> 57:17.360]  that's nice though, I mean you know, if you're a Republican you deserve to get beat up, especially
[57:17.360 --> 57:26.200]  because you won't take the guns from people, oh my goodness, you know what, House GOP quietly
[57:26.200 --> 57:31.440]  revises tax bill to tax income at higher rates over time, folks if you've seen this tax bill
[57:31.440 --> 57:37.200]  it's actually a Democrat looking tax bill, this tax bill is a tax bill that the left
[57:37.200 --> 57:44.080]  would enjoy, rejoice and embrace, I wonder if all the Trump haters that want to tax
[57:44.080 --> 57:47.800]  the rich have seen this tax bill, will they come around on Trump, of course not, so then
[57:47.800 --> 57:49.360]  he's going to do something else.
[57:49.360 --> 57:52.560]  Dr. Grip, you developed living defense for us, it took you over a year to do it, why
[57:52.560 --> 57:54.280]  is this so good?
[57:54.280 --> 57:58.960]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most,
[57:58.960 --> 58:03.600]  I mean I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[58:03.600 --> 58:09.280]  my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's
[58:09.280 --> 58:14.480]  harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism, right now with all the refugees
[58:14.480 --> 58:19.480]  spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere, these are all
[58:19.480 --> 58:20.480]  parasites.
[58:20.480 --> 58:22.680]  Tell us about all the stuff you said, there's so many things that are in it.
[58:22.680 --> 58:27.640]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood, I recommend
[58:27.640 --> 58:30.360]  doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[58:30.360 --> 58:33.640]  Alright well I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today, I just
[58:33.640 --> 58:38.200]  came back in yesterday, living defense, infowarslife.com and folks you can't lose, it's full of stuff

[01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:47.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this original worldwide broadcast Sunday.
[01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:54.920]  Hard to believe already November 5th, 2017, we're going to be live here for the next
[01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:55.920]  two hours.
[01:00:55.920 --> 01:01:04.040]  Owen Schreuer is going to be joining me covering the massive failure of the George Soros funded
[01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:10.240]  communist uprising that was supposed to begin yesterday culminating in the next few weeks
[01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:14.360]  with the overthrow of our republic and the driving of President Trump from office.
[01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:19.560]  We're going to be detailing that coming up with Owen who's going to be joining us at
[01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:21.440]  the bottom of the hour.
[01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:28.280]  In the meantime, we're not just seeing democratic revolutions in Catalan, Spain and Raikia
[01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:35.840]  Vek, Iceland and Austria and Czech Republic and elections in the UK and Brexit and Australia
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:40.040]  and Brazil and all over Africa and Latin America and Asia.
[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:44.880]  We're seeing major rebellions against the globalist program in the most unlikely of
[01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:47.760]  places, Saudi Arabia.
[01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:52.080]  The first trip that Trump was involved in eight, nine months ago when he first got in
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:57.240]  office was to Saudi Arabia, an old famous orb thing he did that was just a controller
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:01.320]  for a threat fusion anti-terrorism center that they built.
[01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:08.040]  And he went there to expose the different royal family members that were involved with
[01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:14.880]  the Bushes, with the Clintons, with Google, with Facebook and others pushing the Arab
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:21.000]  Wahhabist Spring that threatened to even overthrow Saudi Arabia itself where that form of Islam
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.720]  actually comes from.
[01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:27.320]  And the deal that was struck was they would stop backing ISIS at al-Qaeda and the United
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:35.480]  States would then stop being basically soft-handed or wearing kid gloves with Iran.
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:37.280]  That deal was made.
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:42.640]  And now eight plus months after that deal was made, you have these top princelings and
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:50.080]  others that are stakeholders in news core, in city group, Fox News, you name it, being
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:51.080]  arrested.
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:56.760]  These are the very people helping fund the anti-Trump movements with Soros here in the
[01:02:56.760 --> 01:02:57.760]  United States.
[01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:02.120]  So all over the world, globalism is in deep trouble.
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:08.720]  And we're going to break down the situation unfolding in Saudi Arabia where an ICBM also
[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:14.400]  was fired yesterday that hit near their airport, just a lot of craziness going on.
[01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:21.400]  But first, when we return, the collapse of the Democratic Party establishment because
[01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:26.440]  the witch Hillary refused to leave, the Soros-funded creature Hillary.
[01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:31.360]  We now learn that Donna Brazil, the head of the DNC, feared for her life after top
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:37.240]  DNC staffer over email Seth Rich was executed, shot in the back, and that basically she believed
[01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:41.720]  that Hillary and the DNC were behind it and that she knew that there were reports of their
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:48.160]  servers being hacked by Pakistan, China, Russia, you name it, and tried to stop it and that
[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:51.080]  Hillary and others said, don't do it.
[01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:56.840]  That's the latest shoe to drop as Donna Brazil separates herself from these individuals.
[01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:59.160]  Now, I don't just believe Donna Brazil.
[01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:03.800]  I know from my own deep research that what she's saying is true.
[01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:10.520]  And our listeners know we covered all this first as you get next year's news today here
[01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:11.520]  at InfoWars.
[01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:17.400]  So this is powerful, and this signifies that Hillary could be getting ready to be indicted.
[01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:21.240]  The globalist might actually just Arkansas her before that happens, but I hope that doesn't
[01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:23.320]  happen because I want to see her stay in trial.
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:29.080]  We are seeing globally the old order fall, the old new order fall, and a new system of
[01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:31.880]  nationalism and free market coming in.
[01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:32.880]  This is incredible.
[01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:33.880]  It's accelerated.
[01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:35.680]  It's happening faster than I thought.
[01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:39.360]  It's a very exciting time, but also a very dangerous time to be alive.
[01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:40.360]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:42.760]  This is the InfoWars, infowars.com, newswars.com.

[01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:52.040]  It is an active standing up when you spread the links, the articles, and buy products
[01:05:52.040 --> 01:06:00.120]  from us, and then we commit rampage against the enemy totally.
[01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:05.800]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:10.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:17.040]  Here we are, ladies and gentlemen, Sunday, November 5th, 2017, and the entire Globalist
[01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:20.920]  Crime Syndicate, the entire international crime order.
[01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:26.440]  The New World Order is coming down because it's authoritarian and abusive of the nation
[01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:30.720]  states and individuals, and Donald Trump is a leading captain in that fight.
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:35.200]  But all of you are on the front lines of this huge awakening.
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:40.720]  God of Brazil, the former head of the DNC has come out and said Hillary stole the election
[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:42.120]  from Bernie Sanders.
[01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:43.800]  I don't need to hear that from her.
[01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:47.160]  It's a fact, but I know she's telling the truth because what she's written about and
[01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:50.960]  gone public about in her new book is what happened at the time.
[01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:52.200]  It's all confirmed.
[01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:58.800]  But bigger than that, mainstream media, CNN, MSNBC, Wolf Glitzer, Pocahontas, Elizabeth
[01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:06.080]  Warren, they're all turning against the Clintons now because they know there's no way they
[01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:07.600]  can cover up the crimes.
[01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:11.720]  They've committed, so they're trying to distance themselves from it.
[01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:12.720]  That's not going to work.
[01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:17.680]  But here is the giant, brutal, massive bombshell.
[01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:22.680]  We broke first that they rigged the nomination process against Bernie Sanders.
[01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:25.560]  We've been proven correct in triplicate.
[01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:30.440]  So again, we're the real news, MSNBC, the rest, they're the fake news.
[01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:36.280]  We also broke that Seth Rich clearly was executed and murdered as the head staffer over the
[01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:37.880]  emails for the DNC.
[01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:44.520]  There were major Homeland Security investigations over Pakistan, India, Russia, China, the EU,
[01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:47.400]  in our servers, Hillary's illegal servers.
[01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:48.680]  They wanted to cover it up.
[01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:53.000]  Donna Brazil has now come out and said she wanted to go to Homeland Security.
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:57.360]  She tried to get Jay Johnson involved and Hillary and others said, shut up, don't look
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:07:59.720]  at it, don't investigate it.
[01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:00.720]  Incredible.
[01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:05.640]  But that pales in significance to the headline at infowars.com.
[01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:14.000]  From her book, Donna Brazil says she feared for her life after Seth Rich was killed and
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:18.920]  that she basically thought the DNC or others were going to try to kill her to cover up
[01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:22.560]  what she knew about whatever was happening in those servers.
[01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:25.600]  This is the rats leaving the sinking ship.
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:30.760]  Donna Brazil is controlled by Biden, by Obama and others, and they're trying to compartmentalize
[01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:31.760]  now the danger.
[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:33.320]  But think about this.
[01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:34.320]  We got hammered.
[01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:35.320]  We got attacked.
[01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:40.320]  We got demonized for being the first to expose that Seth Rich was a political murder.
[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:43.880]  Then WikiLeaks came out and said, we don't normally give up sources, but basically he's
[01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:50.280]  our source and we've got a big reward for whoever finds out who killed him.
[01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:51.960]  That's why they're now so desperate.
[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:56.880]  And the fact that the Democratic Party establishment is running from the Clintons right now shows
[01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:58.960]  you the whole house of cards is coming down.
[01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:00.200]  Who else deserves credit?
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:02.000]  You the listeners for taking action.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:07.400]  Sean Hannity almost got fired over exposing all this, but he didn't back down.
[01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:14.120]  The fact that we've held the line, stood firm, held fast is an example of stalwart action
[01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:15.280]  in the face of tyranny.
[01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:21.400]  Now I'm going to read over some of the transcripts of her book here, getting into this in a moment.
[01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:26.640]  And first I want to play Roger Stone last night, first, before anybody else had read
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:32.320]  the book and found this, he broke the news last night, live with us on air as we were
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:38.080]  ending our marathon broadcast covering Antifa's failed, a November 4th so-called revolution
[01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:39.600]  that I'll cover later.
[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:44.000]  And again, it's up to all of us to push this story out there because other than Drudge
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:49.720]  and Zero Hedge and Info Wars, hardly anybody is covering the fact that Donna Brazil feared
[01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:55.840]  for her life after Seth Rich was executed, vindicating everything we said, everything
[01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:56.840]  you said.
[01:09:56.840 --> 01:10:02.560]  I mean, every day, huge new developments drop, proving we were dead on.
[01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:05.640]  Here's Roger Stone reporting from Florida last night.
[01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:09.240]  This is Roger Stone for Info Wars.
[01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:14.760]  Former DNC big, Donna Brazil dropped a bombshell in her new book when she admitted that she
[01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:19.320]  feared her life in the wake of the murder of Seth Rich.
[01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:24.240]  That means that Brazil knew that Rich had been murdered for political purposes.
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:28.480]  One need look only at the interview with Julian Assange of WikiLeaks where he says three
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:34.560]  times in regard to Rich that sources to WikiLeaks are in great physical danger.
[01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:40.120]  And then he posts a $25,000 reward for apprehension of Seth Rich's murderer.
[01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:42.000]  What more do you need to know?
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:49.920]  Roger Stone for Info Wars, what more do you need, ladies and gentlemen, Donna Brazil,
[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:57.280]  the former head of the DNC has now come out publicly and said, I fear for my life.
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:02.200]  Seth Rich was probably murdered politically to cover up corruption in the DNC and a bunch
[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:04.520]  of foreign countries inside our servers.
[01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:09.240]  And I'm not involved and I'm not going to prison with the Clintons.
[01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:14.240]  Just days after she comes out and confirms what already we all know, it happened publicly,
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:20.640]  but the media covered it up that the nomination was stolen from Bernie Sanders.
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:28.360]  He won most of the states, but then they would just give him the delegates.
[01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:34.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is an example of pure, unadulterated, incredible arrogance
[01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:38.720]  of people thinking that they were invincible and could get away with anything, but I'm
[01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:40.360]  starting to get freaked out.
[01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:47.360]  I mean, everything we've talked about is now being confirmed on a daily basis that Trump
[01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:52.920]  was about to take down the Wahhabist and the ISIS supporters in Saudi Arabia just happened
[01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:57.520]  this weekend, that China was going to have to back down in their trade war, starting
[01:11:57.520 --> 01:12:00.480]  to happen, that Trump was going to release the JFK files.
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:02.480]  He did it.
[01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:08.120]  Just everything, seeing it in mid-floorides causing brain damage in children, that vaccines
[01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:09.120]  are killing people.
[01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:15.680]  I mean, we are seeing a collapse, ladies and gentlemen, in the globalist operation and
[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:18.040]  it's all because of you taking action.
[01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:23.600]  We're seeing nationalist and pro-populist and pro-capitalist winning all over the world
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:24.920]  minute by minute.
[01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:29.080]  This is like sudden death over time in a football game that never ends.
[01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:31.080]  It is so riveting.
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:38.120]  Here's a ZRO Hedge article that we have linked up on infowars.com that came out today.
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:43.080]  We have our video breaking it last night embedded inside with Roger Stone and let's read over
[01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:44.080]  some of this.
[01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:50.680]  Donna Brazil says she feared for her life, close quote, after Seth Rich was killed, executed
[01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:57.080]  just the fact that Brazil says she too suspected that some nefarious might be afoot is reason
[01:12:57.080 --> 01:12:59.400]  up to take a second look at his death.
[01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:04.240]  Well, look at how desperate they were to demonize anybody that looked at it to say you hated
[01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:08.800]  the family or you were a bad person when the family first questioned it as well, then how
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:10.440]  people changed their stories.
[01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:15.000]  I mean, this was the machine in motion.
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:20.160]  She says top Democrats initially instructed her not to discuss her concerns with others
[01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:24.240]  about the fact of how compromised the servers were.
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:29.320]  Her fears only intensifies, she says, after the mysterious shooting of former campaign
[01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:34.160]  staffer Seth Rich, who the authorities said was killed during a robbery, though many so-called
[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:38.920]  conspiracy theorists, that means questioning known liars, have speculated about the possible
[01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:43.400]  democratic plot to kill Seth Rich for his role in leaking the stash of D&C emails to
[01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:49.400]  WikiLeaks, Brazil's anxiety eventually spiraled out of control to the point where she feared
[01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:54.880]  her own life while serving as interim chairman of the D&C.
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:14:00.760]  After Schultz was removed, over the laptop, connected into Pakistan.
[01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:05.760]  Of course, if it's true that Seth Rich was killed as a punishment for leaking the emails,
[01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:10.280]  then that would be, of course, invalidate most of the evidence supporting the Russian
[01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:15.160]  interference narrative that has been propagated by the Democrats and their partners in the
[01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:19.920]  intelligence community.
[01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:24.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, I do not have words to describe to you right now how incredible
[01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:26.520]  this is.
[01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:31.680]  Everything we've talked about, about the IMF and World Bank wanting world government,
[01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:36.280]  and about the plan to bankrupt the government and get rid of the borders, and the plan to
[01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:42.160]  break up the family, and the plans for communist revolution, and all of it is falling flat
[01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:48.880]  on its face, I cannot express to you words enough of how important this is.
[01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:53.440]  The globalists were arrogant, they hijacked America while we were sleeping, they used
[01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:56.800]  our energy and power to expand their control worldwide.
[01:14:56.800 --> 01:15:04.240]  But as soon as we woke up, you could hear the brakes being slammed like a car wreck,
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:09.880]  and now it's a whole new world, but it's up to us to be moral and be good and be strong
[01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:15.160]  and not just throw out one kleptocratic regime that thought it was invincible.
[01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:20.360]  To bring in a new set of systems, we've got to maintain our vigilance, we have to promote
[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:26.160]  the republic, promote being chivalrous, promote the free market, and promote staying focused
[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:31.640]  and honoring questioning big government and corruption, not demonizing it as being a conspiracy
[01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:32.640]  theorist.
[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:36.200]  We used to call that an involved, informed, active citizen.
[01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:40.040]  Praise God for what's happening, and thank all of you for taking action.
[01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:44.000]  Without you the info warriors of every race, color, and creed, we'd be up the creek without
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.000]  a paddle.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:58.200]  We'll be back with the fall of the globalist control of Saudi Arabia straight ahead.
[01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:01.120]  America is an information-based civil war.
[01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:04.840]  That's why now, more than ever, we've got to hit the streets of America and let these
[01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:08.520]  globalists scum know we're not backing down from their bullying.
[01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:14.880]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:20.920]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly
[01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:21.920]  the counterculture.
[01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:28.520]  The real punk rock is being a patriot, who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom,
[01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:31.360]  who at the same time is tolerant.
[01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:36.160]  American liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Geverson's classical liberalism.
[01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:41.520]  They are the anti-liberalists who defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote
[01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:42.520]  freedom worldwide.
[01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:48.040]  We've got more than 60 original designs of high-quality t-shirts for men and women, as

[01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:06.720]  enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:10.760]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:15.120]  Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:20.440]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:26.840]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:31.960]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn
[01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:34.080]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:38.360]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections
[01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:40.960]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:45.400]  Brought by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:26.800]  and Biblical times.
[01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:31.880]  Instead of containing fluoride, our super-blue line is floated with the good halogen iodine
[01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:36.120]  and an array of other beneficial compounds that have been hand-selected for their oral
[01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:37.120]  health benefits.

[01:19:55.400 --> 01:20:21.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:36.640]  We are living in the season of change.
[01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:41.440]  True change, not Barack Obama's change that meant more globalism, more socialism, more
[01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:42.440]  command and control.
[01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:47.520]  Now we're living in the true season of change where all over the world, every week, nation
[01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:53.640]  states vote to rediscover and reclaim their sovereignty, and one place that's happening
[01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:55.760]  is in Saudi Arabia.
[01:20:55.760 --> 01:21:03.720]  Before I hit this giant news, here's an article by Paul Joseph Watson on Friday from InfoWars.com.
[01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:10.640]  Obama-era FBI Assistant Director of the FBI says, quote, Americans must accept terror attacks
[01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:13.040]  as the price of diversity.
[01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:17.640]  And you've got Brennan, who converted to Islam, who became the head of the CIA.
[01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:23.640]  You had the Bushes who made deals with Saudi Arabia to literally sell out Europe and the
[01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:27.000]  West to Islam.
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:31.240]  That continued under Obama and the Muslim Brotherhood and the same Wahhabist groups.
[01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:35.280]  Under Trump in 10 months, that's all been changed.
[01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:39.280]  Saudi Arabia was told, you can keep your power, you can keep your country, you can keep your
[01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:40.280]  kingdom.
[01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:45.760]  But Wahhabism is over, your imperialistic Islamic expansion is over, and if you don't
[01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:48.480]  do that, we're going to overthrow you.
[01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:54.880]  So Trump, months ago, traveled to Saudi Arabia, met with them, and they had agreed to do that.
[01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:59.160]  We then saw terror attacks intensify because there's subgroups in Saudi Arabia that didn't
[01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:00.160]  want to do it.
[01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:04.320]  A few years ago, Russia was threatened by Prince Bandar, who's been part of the group
[01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:08.000]  that's been grabbed and arrested.
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:11.720]  And they said to the Russians, if you don't back off in Syria, we're going to launch attacks
[01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:16.560]  on the Olympics at Sochi, we're going to launch attacks on your tourism centers, and Russia
[01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:19.480]  doubled down and didn't back off and stopped them.
[01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:24.000]  Well, clearly from my intel, Saudi Arabian criminal elements, as we reported last week
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:30.240]  and week before, were involved in the attacks in Las Vegas as a message to Trump and others
[01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:33.680]  that if you don't back off, we're going to not just use Islamic attackers, we're going
[01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:37.680]  to use deep state mercenary groups to do this.
[01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:44.680]  Now, we've seen a purge against all the big top princes that owned News Corp and own
[01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:50.200]  Citigroup, and we're part of this whole leftist globalist operation.
[01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:54.560]  The main prince that was running the operation, again, is somebody that said Trump will be
[01:22:54.560 --> 01:23:00.080]  removed, an Ever-Trumper, and a guy still financing, as we said, during the campaign,
[01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:03.920]  hundreds of millions against Trump and currently trying to throw him out.
[01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:09.800]  So understand, the guy involved in our election, involved funding ISIS, you name it, has now
[01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:10.800]  been arrested.
[01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:13.080]  Do you think Trump's visit had an effect?
[01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:19.000]  Purge, Saudi king, arrests princes, cabinet members in anti-corruption crackdown, billionaire
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:23.440]  prince and 38 cabinet members charged with corruption and money laundering.
[01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:29.360]  And CNN has the sickening headlines about the incredible, the amazing prince has been
[01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:30.360]  arrested.
[01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:34.880]  He funds leftist movements, he's been working with Iran to double-cross Saudi Arabia, I
[01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:36.840]  mean, he's got a true globalist.
[01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:43.680]  In a shocking development, Saudi press al-Madin reported late Saturday that prominent billionaire
[01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:47.800]  member of the royal Saudi family and one of the biggest shareholders of Citigroup News
[01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:52.480]  Corp, that's Fox, and Twitter, not to mention, notice you can't criticize Islam on Twitter
[01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:58.120]  when they're calling for killing you, not to mention frequent CNBC guest, Alawid Bin Ta'al,
[01:23:58.120 --> 01:23:59.120]  that's CNN worships.
[01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:03.840]  Go to CNN's website, they literally call it the incredible prince, along with 10, because
[01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:08.840]  he finances half the network, 10 senior princes and some 30 ministers has been arrested for
[01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:12.840]  corruption and money laundering charges on orders from the new anti-corruption committee
[01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:18.160]  headed by crown prince Mohammed bin Salam and royal prince, private planes have all
[01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:20.280]  been grounded.
[01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:21.280]  So there you go.
[01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:25.000]  Yeah, oh, you're going to stop Trump, you're going to stop America, you're going to kick
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:29.440]  us around, going to have Saudi intelligence go threaten talk show host.
[01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:34.840]  I think that's going to really have an effect with people here in America.
[01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:38.440]  You don't think that they don't understand the patriots in our government that if talk
[01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:45.120]  show host can be pushed around, and if business owners can be pushed around, and if patriotic
[01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:50.000]  stock companies can be pushed around and threatened by people that they won't be threatened
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:54.760]  next, you don't think that, you don't think we don't know what's been going on, you don't
[01:24:54.760 --> 01:25:00.720]  think we're about to rip your arms out from their sockets.
[01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:07.560]  So you want political war, you got it, you got it on all fronts now, hundreds of fronts,
[01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:12.680]  we're coming in, we're coming in, Hillary's going down, the head of the DNC saying she
[01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:17.920]  stole the election, she killed people, it's all coming out, and only you whores and media
[01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:22.880]  that take the globalist money to sell the country out, your names are going to be anathema,
[01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:27.160]  you're going to be mud.
[01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:31.000]  Here's another one, Saudi Arabia intercepts ballistic missile over capital, that was used
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:35.880]  as a diversion that hit outside the airport, fired from Yemen.
[01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:41.360]  Remember Trump urges Saudi Arabia to list state oil company on New York stock exchange,
[01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:49.440]  but a group of anti-American globalists tried to block it, tried to block Trump's deal,
[01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:54.800]  and so what happened, oh, they're all been arrested, see how that works, scum?
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:26:01.520]  Oh, but don't worry, we've seen George Herbert Walker Bush, now eight women have come forward
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:06.520]  saying he grabbed them, grabbed their butts, tried to rape them from his wheelchair, he's
[01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:11.400]  now come out with his son and said that Trump's a blowhard, let me tell you who's sold out
[01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:18.520]  America to Saudi Arabia, the Bushes, the globalist, back in the 70s, and now they are being put
[01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:26.040]  in line, I mean, look at George W. Jr. with his dad, I mean, talk about two bombed out
[01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:32.400]  of their brain lunatics who think them coming out against Trump now, when they sold us out
[01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:38.680]  all these foreign interests, these corrupt, twisted lunatics that sold us out to the Nazis
[01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:43.040]  and are lucky that Prescott Bush, Herbert Walker Bush's dad wasn't arrested during
[01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:47.960]  the McCormick-Dickstein committee hearings, you people are jokes.
[01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:52.600]  So that's what this comes down to, and now the rats are leaving the sinking ship.
[01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:56.960]  Even the Huffington Post says Hillary Clinton, the Podesta group in the Saudi regime, and
[01:26:56.960 --> 01:27:01.680]  now they're admitting they're on the payroll, the corrupt elements of the Saudi regime,
[01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:07.880]  and Podesta is getting in trouble for uranium one and everything else, it's all coming
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:09.280]  back to haunt them.
[01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:14.120]  We told you Seth Rich was a political assassination, nothing was taken, now the head of the DNC
[01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:20.080]  says it was, we told you all this stuff, and every day it's all coming out.
[01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:23.920]  And we told you they were planning a violent revolution tomorrow that would probably be
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:29.640]  a dud, and it was, we're going to cover that with Owen Schreuer coming up in the next segment.
[01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:34.080]  They think they're going to drive us out of power, we don't want power, we want free
[01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:38.400]  market to be left alone, and to have low taxes, and to be able to have the American
[01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:43.160]  Dream again, and the world wants that dream, because it's a reality, and it's happening
[01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:44.160]  briefly.

[01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:52.160]  was a dud that sort of was funded yesterday.

[01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:07.520]  That's right.
[01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:12.240]  Now's the time to build your own food storage with Harvest Rights Freeze Dryers.

[01:32:25.960 --> 01:32:27.800]  Woo, that's what I'm talking about.
[01:32:27.800 --> 01:32:32.800]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating,
[01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:36.800]  you know like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:42.640]  Harvest Right Freeze Dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value
[01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:46.120]  and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[01:32:46.120 --> 01:32:49.640]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[01:32:49.640 --> 01:32:53.680]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:54.680]  So what are you waiting for?

[01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:13.880]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:22.680]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:26.120]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show here, filling in for Alex Owen Schreuer.
[01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:34.080]  We'll be with you until 6pm central as we are every Sunday, 4-6pm central.
[01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:38.840]  Infowars kicks off their weekday broadcasting tomorrow morning, 8am, real news with David
[01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:45.400]  Knight, 4 hours of the Alex Jones Show as always 11-3 and then followed up by The War Room
[01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:48.800]  hosted by yours truly from 3-6pm central.
[01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:51.880]  That is our live weekday schedule now.
[01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:53.080]  Thanks to you supporting us.
[01:33:53.080 --> 01:34:02.840]  Alright, we've got some details coming through the pipeline now on the shooter in Sutherland
[01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:08.000]  Springs, Texas today who killed reportedly 27 people.
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:13.880]  We're hearing different numbers, but the highest would be 27, the lowest 20.
[01:34:13.880 --> 01:34:23.920]  Devin Patrick Kelly is the one who's been ID'd as the shooter.
[01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:27.600]  And how do you like this, folks?
[01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:42.120]  An Air Force veteran and a gun owner who posted on October 29th a picture of his rifle with
[01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:46.440]  the caption, she's a bad bitch.
[01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:51.480]  Well, that's going to feed right into the Democrats' hands, so we can already see the
[01:34:51.480 --> 01:34:54.960]  narrative that's going to play out here, folks.
[01:34:54.960 --> 01:34:57.240]  No need to pontificate on that.
[01:34:57.240 --> 01:35:02.200]  We already know where this one's going.
[01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:06.400]  So this is what we have.
[01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:16.720]  This morning, just after 11am, we're told that Devin Patrick Kelly, a 26-year-old who
[01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:26.080]  lived just outside of San Antonio, went into a Baptist church in Sutherland Springs and
[01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:30.120]  killed at least 20 people, injured 50.
[01:35:30.120 --> 01:35:36.040]  Sadly, no one at the church was armed at the time, and he met zero resistance.
[01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:43.320]  He then fled the scene and were told was then apprehended about five blocks from the church.
[01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:49.240]  We do not know yet whether he died from a self-inflicted bullet wound or one from the
[01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:50.720]  police.
[01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:55.080]  That is really the lone detail that we don't have.
[01:35:55.080 --> 01:35:59.280]  The other piece of the story, all the other puzzle pieces have already been laid out there
[01:35:59.280 --> 01:36:03.880]  for us and for the media to report on.
[01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:06.800]  We are still waiting for the press conference to go live.
[01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:10.760]  I would suspect that's going to be coming down here soon now that they have ID'd and
[01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:13.040]  released the name of the killer.
[01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:20.100]  Rob Dew is live on the scene right now at the press conference as we wait for official
[01:36:20.100 --> 01:36:23.880]  statements from the police or from the FBI.
[01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:29.840]  We know the FBI is on the scene as well, so it will be interesting to see who controls
[01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:32.360]  the press conference there.
[01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:44.760]  But again, Devin Patrick Kelly and Air Force veteran and somebody who had a gun as his
[01:36:44.760 --> 01:36:51.720]  background and apparently it was his rifle that he posted about, I guess this is on Facebook
[01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:56.280]  here.
[01:36:56.280 --> 01:37:07.400]  So there you go folks, so great.
[01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:14.240]  Well you already know what's going to happen tomorrow, it's the white male's fault and
[01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:16.800]  it's the gun's fault.
[01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:25.680]  Just like the Austin Chronicle said, white males are the new face of terror.
[01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:32.120]  Now we have not been provided a motive in the Las Vegas Massacre.
[01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:35.520]  You can guess your own reasons as to why that is.
[01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:41.480]  I wonder if and when we'll ever get a motive on this deal.
[01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:48.720]  I wonder what type of, well let's just say it will be interesting to see what goes on
[01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:54.400]  in the interwebs on the forums such as 4chan and Reddit as we continue to get more details
[01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:56.200]  on this.
[01:37:56.200 --> 01:38:05.200]  It will be interesting to see what comes of any video footage that may have been recorded
[01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:08.120]  of the congregation that day.
[01:38:08.120 --> 01:38:14.840]  This is a church, a congregation that records all of their Sundays and it looks like the
[01:38:14.840 --> 01:38:17.200]  press conference now is about to begin folks.
[01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:22.480]  It looks like Greg Abbott is going to be leading us off here.
[01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:30.680]  Greg Abbott about to speak from a community center just outside of Sutherland Springs.
[01:38:30.680 --> 01:38:32.800]  Our own Rob Dew is on the scene.
[01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:38.520]  Let's go live to the press conference for pitching in and helping out and continuing to demonstrate
[01:38:38.520 --> 01:38:44.240]  to the entire world the way that Texans come together to help their fellow Texans.
[01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:54.240]  As a state we are dealing with the largest mass shooting in our state specifically.
[01:38:54.240 --> 01:39:02.680]  For so many families we've lost family members, fathers, mothers, sons, and daughters.
[01:39:02.680 --> 01:39:07.240]  The tragedy of course is worse than the fact that it occurred in a church, a place of worship,
[01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:12.480]  but these people were innocently gunned down.
[01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:18.760]  We mourn their loss but we support their family members.
[01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:25.880]  In their efforts as they put all the pieces of a very complex puzzle together to try to
[01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:33.000]  provide their community all the answers they need and deserve.
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:40.280]  Unfortunately I'm sad to tell you to confirm at least at this moment in time there are
[01:39:40.280 --> 01:39:44.520]  26 lives that have been lost.
[01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:50.320]  We don't know that number will rise or not, all we know is that's too many and this will
[01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:58.000]  be a long suffering morning for those in pain.
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:07.440]  We ask for God's comfort, for God's guidance, and for God's healing for all those who are
[01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:08.440]  suffering.
[01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:15.720]  This is the Governor of Texas Greg Abbott reporting from the press conference.
[01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:21.680]  You put your arm around your kid and give your kid a big hug and let them know how much
[01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:31.000]  you love them, knowing that we support each other, to all your friends and your neighbors,
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:34.040]  that you support them and that you will work with them.
[01:40:34.040 --> 01:40:42.960]  I'm very proud of the way we have so many people working together to respond to this.
[01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:52.960]  Already talking to the emergency team in Texas reported that the emergency medical task force
[01:40:52.960 --> 01:41:01.680]  from San Antonio was deployed to help respond to the magnitude of this tragedy.
[01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:09.280]  San Antonio area hospitals and trauma centers have coordinated with regard to patient movement
[01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:11.960]  and patient care.
[01:41:11.960 --> 01:41:20.480]  The Red Cross has set up Family Assistance Center to help all families affected by this.
[01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:25.920]  One thing that is very important for everybody affected by this, whether you're a family
[01:41:25.920 --> 01:41:34.000]  member or non-family member, is that you avail yourself of counseling resources that will
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:39.560]  be made readily available in abundance.
[01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:47.400]  Now we have so many people who have helped respond in coordinated fashion already.
[01:41:47.400 --> 01:41:53.840]  I'll express my gratitude to the President who called from overseas.
[01:41:53.840 --> 01:42:00.160]  My gratitude to Senators Cornyn and Cruz with whom I've already spoken, as well as members
[01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:03.040]  of the Texas Legislature.
[01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:09.080]  But when you look at the robust response from just the immediate area, I'll express my gratitude
[01:42:09.080 --> 01:42:15.680]  to the Sheriff of Wilson County, to the District Attorney from this area, Audrey Lewis, who
[01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:21.080]  is I say this area is because our territory is larger than just Wilson County.
[01:42:21.080 --> 01:42:25.840]  To DPS, Regional Director Freyman Martin, each of those three will be speaking shortly.
[01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:28.520]  All right, folks, we've got to go to a break here.
[01:42:28.520 --> 01:42:31.000]  We've got one more segment left of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:35.640]  You were just hearing from Greg Abbott at the beginning of this press conference.
[01:42:35.640 --> 01:42:39.000]  26 lives lost.
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:46.480]  Devin Kelly, a former U.S. Air Force member, served from 2010 to 2014 dishonorably discharged.
[01:42:46.480 --> 01:42:51.520]  When he used an AR-15 rifle, they are reporting for this mass shooting.
[01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:54.480]  We'll continue to cover this as more details emerge.
[01:42:54.480 --> 01:42:56.480]  Don't go anywhere.
[01:42:56.480 --> 01:43:02.920]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, we're running the biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling
[01:43:02.920 --> 01:43:04.760]  product, Brain Force.
[01:43:04.760 --> 01:43:08.760]  Now Brain Force Plus, there's 20% more in each bottle.
[01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:12.840]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the
[01:43:12.840 --> 01:43:15.480]  United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:20.400]  So I'm offering for the first time ever 50% off and I thought I could offer this for maybe
[01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:21.400]  a month.
[01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:27.360]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse
[01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:32.080]  because the fans of it, already you're stocking up, they know how great it is, a whole bunch
[01:43:32.080 --> 01:43:36.200]  of organic, natural, healthy, known, new tropics.
[01:43:36.200 --> 01:43:41.520]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then Brain Force is for you and you're supporting
[01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:44.320]  the broadcast at the same time.
[01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:46.120]  That's a good deal at $39.

[01:44:22.360 --> 01:44:24.640]  we do not use nanoparticles.
[01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:28.160]  The larger the particle, the safer it is for your body.

[01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:03.480]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[01:45:03.480 --> 01:45:08.320]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance
[01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:11.200]  to organize and prepare a defense.
[01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:17.400]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums
[01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:19.920]  of their own, air raid sirens.
[01:45:19.920 --> 01:45:24.280]  But in the 21st century, there were silent weapons for quiet war.
[01:45:24.280 --> 01:45:28.920]  Pathogens added to the food and water, and to the lining of plastics that destroy our
[01:45:28.920 --> 01:45:29.920]  vitality.
[01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:33.920]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:37.400]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[01:45:37.400 --> 01:45:45.360]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation
[01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:49.040]  to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.

[01:47:22.760 --> 01:47:28.600]  Folks, right now the press conference is live and they're now reporting it was a citizen
[01:47:28.600 --> 01:47:34.160]  with a gun that may have actually saved lives and stopped the shooting before it got worse.
[01:47:34.160 --> 01:47:36.720]  Let's go live for the press conference.
[01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:38.440]  We know he's deceased in the vehicle.
[01:47:38.440 --> 01:47:42.200]  The suspect has not been completely identified.
[01:47:42.200 --> 01:47:46.280]  We believe he's a young white male, maybe in his early 20s.
[01:47:46.280 --> 01:47:53.720]  He was dressed in an all-black tactical type gear and was wearing a ballistic vest.
[01:47:53.720 --> 01:47:57.920]  The delay in getting him identified is there were multiple weapons in the vehicle and the
[01:47:57.920 --> 01:48:03.560]  vehicle has been processed by our Texas Ranger Special Operations Group bomb techs.
[01:48:03.560 --> 01:48:07.520]  There's a lot of work to be done in this investigation.
[01:48:07.520 --> 01:48:14.320]  We know that there are 23 found deceased inside the church, two deceased outside the church,
[01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:18.520]  and now one of them that was transported that was injured has deceased.
[01:48:18.520 --> 01:48:25.200]  Bringing the total to 26, we have approximately 20 that are transported local and in hospitals
[01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:31.080]  in San Antonio with injuries that vary from minor to very severe.
[01:48:31.080 --> 01:48:37.680]  We know the ages range from five years old to 72 years of age.
[01:48:37.680 --> 01:48:40.200]  There's a lot of work to be done.
[01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:45.160]  We are only hours into this investigation, which is going to take a significant length
[01:48:45.160 --> 01:48:46.160]  of time.
[01:48:46.160 --> 01:48:49.680]  We will continue to provide information as it becomes available.
[01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:51.240]  We know you're going to have a lot of questions.
[01:48:51.240 --> 01:48:53.760]  There are many, many that we cannot answer.
[01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:55.400]  We continue to process crime scenes.
[01:48:55.400 --> 01:48:57.320]  We have multiple, multiple crime scenes.
[01:48:57.320 --> 01:48:58.320]  We have the church.
[01:48:58.320 --> 01:48:59.320]  We have outside the church.
[01:48:59.320 --> 01:49:02.000]  We have where the suspect vehicle was located.
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:06.520]  We have following up on the suspect and where he's from, his residence.
[01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:08.920]  We have many, many people to interview.
[01:49:08.920 --> 01:49:14.120]  We have Texas Rangers at all the hospitals, locating those and interviewing those who
[01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:15.400]  were injured.
[01:49:15.400 --> 01:49:19.640]  So not a lot of information to give at this time, but the state of Texas, we have every
[01:49:19.640 --> 01:49:24.200]  resource that we have available, Texas Rangers, special operations, Texas Highway Patrol
[01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:29.800]  crime scene labs, victim services, the Texas Division of Emergency Management.
[01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:32.000]  Every resource we have available is working.
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:36.640]  And if they do this investigation, we'll be able to answer any reasonable question as
[01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:37.640]  to what happened.
[01:49:37.640 --> 01:49:38.640]  Was the neighbor injured?
[01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:39.640]  The one that engaged him?
[01:49:39.640 --> 01:49:40.640]  No, he was not.
[01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:41.640]  Did that?
[01:49:41.640 --> 01:49:42.640]  Great.
[01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:49.240]  So interesting, they're reporting that it was a neighbor that heard the gunshots that
[01:49:49.240 --> 01:49:53.600]  came out and with his own rifle and may have stopped shooting from getting worse as they
[01:49:53.600 --> 01:49:57.000]  just reported that the shooter had other weapons in his vehicle.
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:58.520]  So let's go to Greg Abbott now.
[01:49:58.520 --> 01:50:02.680]  Certain evaluation of exactly what happened and we will provide that explanation as quickly
[01:50:02.680 --> 01:50:04.080]  as possible.
[01:50:04.080 --> 01:50:09.760]  We will be leaving here and going to meet with some of the family members of those
[01:50:09.760 --> 01:50:15.160]  affected as soon as we finish up, but we'll take a few questions.
[01:50:15.160 --> 01:50:23.160]  How many were in the church and how many escaped death or being wounded?
[01:50:23.160 --> 01:50:24.160]  Anybody knows that.
[01:50:24.160 --> 01:50:27.600]  If we don't have those numbers, there were people in the church that escaped that were
[01:50:27.600 --> 01:50:28.600]  not injured.
[01:50:28.600 --> 01:50:30.600]  But we don't have all the information.
[01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:31.600]  I'm sorry.
[01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:37.520]  So they're now saying that there were eyewitnesses of the shooting inside the church that they
[01:50:37.520 --> 01:50:39.600]  believe escaped without harm.
[01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:47.120]  Not at this time, that is being investigated, but we can't say one way or the other.
[01:50:47.120 --> 01:50:52.000]  What about him was suspicious to begin with or what initiated the original call?
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:56.360]  Those are the types of things that are under intense investigation right now and hopefully
[01:50:56.360 --> 01:50:58.920]  we will learn about them in the next 24 hours.
[01:50:58.920 --> 01:51:03.120]  The revised total of victims, that does not include the shooter, correct?
[01:51:03.120 --> 01:51:04.120]  Correct.
[01:51:04.120 --> 01:51:08.520]  Can you tell us anything about a possible raid at the suspect's home?
[01:51:08.520 --> 01:51:12.520]  All those types of things will be pieces of information that will be coming out shortly.
[01:51:12.520 --> 01:51:15.200]  Are any victims outside the church?
[01:51:15.200 --> 01:51:16.200]  Yes.
[01:51:16.200 --> 01:51:17.760]  Do you know anything about any of those?
[01:51:17.760 --> 01:51:18.760]  Interesting.
[01:51:18.760 --> 01:51:19.760]  Victims outside the church.
[01:51:19.760 --> 01:51:21.840]  He would have done this.
[01:51:21.840 --> 01:51:24.520]  All of those types of things are being looked into as we speak.
[01:51:24.520 --> 01:51:25.520]  Can we take one more question?
[01:51:25.520 --> 01:51:26.520]  When are you going to help such a shooter?
[01:51:26.520 --> 01:51:27.520]  Did I hear Russian?
[01:51:27.520 --> 01:51:28.520]  Say again.
[01:51:28.520 --> 01:51:34.360]  The health insurance family was in attendance at the church and the Mark IV had a notion.
[01:51:34.360 --> 01:51:35.360]  Unaware of that.
[01:51:35.360 --> 01:51:36.360]  When we release his name?
[01:51:36.360 --> 01:51:37.360]  As soon as possible.
[01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:38.360]  Was he known to do that?
[01:51:38.360 --> 01:51:39.360]  So this is interesting.
[01:51:39.360 --> 01:51:43.000]  We've had a name released, Devin Patrick Kelly, but in this press conference they're
[01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.360]  not willing to commit to that.
[01:51:45.360 --> 01:51:51.080]  As I think you're realizing, there's a lot of information, we want to piece the puzzle
[01:51:51.080 --> 01:51:57.760]  together before we provide you any misinformation and we want to make sure that we meet with
[01:51:57.760 --> 01:52:03.080]  the family members who are affected by this before we release information publicly.
[01:52:03.080 --> 01:52:05.720]  We hope to get this information to you as soon as possible.
[01:52:05.720 --> 01:52:07.720]  Thank you very much.
[01:52:07.720 --> 01:52:10.720]  And the call that came in was not a shooter.
[01:52:10.720 --> 01:52:12.720]  There was no call.
[01:52:12.720 --> 01:52:16.440]  Okay, so that concludes the press conference from Stockdale, Texas.
[01:52:16.440 --> 01:52:17.560]  Our own Rob Dew was there.
[01:52:17.560 --> 01:52:20.960]  He had the whole thing if you want to go back and watch it.
[01:52:20.960 --> 01:52:22.560]  Let's take a couple of interesting notes.
[01:52:22.560 --> 01:52:28.040]  Now we're about to have the clip of the eyewitness that said the neighbor came out and may have
[01:52:28.040 --> 01:52:31.480]  thwarted the shooting from being worse.
[01:52:31.480 --> 01:52:33.680]  That was confirmed in the press conference.
[01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:38.080]  They said 26 dead, that was from Governor Abbott.
[01:52:38.080 --> 01:52:43.280]  Interestingly enough, it sounded like, and again, I just heard this for the first time
[01:52:43.280 --> 01:52:47.040]  and crew, if you guys heard something different than what I heard, please enlighten me.
[01:52:47.040 --> 01:52:51.800]  But it sounded like the one guy described the event that the shooter actually began
[01:52:51.800 --> 01:52:54.360]  outside of the church.
[01:52:54.360 --> 01:52:58.120]  And then he was, I don't know if he was shooting into the church or shooting people out, but
[01:52:58.120 --> 01:53:03.080]  it sounded, the description to me said that the shooter started outside the church, went
[01:53:03.080 --> 01:53:09.360]  around the church shooting and then entered the church and shot more people.
[01:53:09.360 --> 01:53:12.240]  He said that people did escaped unharmed.
[01:53:12.240 --> 01:53:18.480]  And then I guess when he exited the church again is when the neighbor engaged in fire
[01:53:18.480 --> 01:53:20.400]  with him.
[01:53:20.400 --> 01:53:24.000]  And I guess that's when he hopped in the car and tried to flee the scene and then was apprehended
[01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:31.280]  about five blocks later where they said he had more weapons in his vehicle.
[01:53:31.280 --> 01:53:38.800]  Now on that same note, they were unwilling to commit to Devin Patrick Kelly as the shooter,
[01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:44.600]  even though he's the one being reported as the shooter already by most mainstream media
[01:53:44.600 --> 01:53:46.280]  outlets.
[01:53:46.280 --> 01:53:52.800]  And again, this Devin Patrick Kelly was dishonorably discharged after serving in the Air Force
[01:53:52.800 --> 01:53:55.160]  from 2010 to 2014.
[01:53:55.160 --> 01:54:00.000]  He did post on social media pictures of his rifle that they're saying he used.
[01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:07.440]  And then the Facebook page of Devin Patrick Kelly, of course, magically gone right after
[01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:09.000]  his name is released.
[01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:13.120]  So it's amazing how that happens.
[01:54:13.120 --> 01:54:14.560]  So let's go to this clip now.
[01:54:14.560 --> 01:54:20.640]  This is an eyewitness to the neighbor coming out and potentially thwarting the shooting
[01:54:20.640 --> 01:54:23.200]  from getting worse.
[01:54:23.200 --> 01:54:48.400]  Wow, OK, so according to that eyewitness, the neighbor came out, engaged the shooter,
[01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:56.240]  the killer, she believes that a bullet struck the shooter at that point in time, in which
[01:54:56.240 --> 01:55:02.920]  case the shooter then got into his vehicle and fled the scene only to crash it a few
[01:55:02.920 --> 01:55:04.560]  blocks down the road.
[01:55:04.560 --> 01:55:10.000]  Is that a crash because he was so disoriented, lost vision or lost consciousness because
[01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:11.280]  of blood loss?
[01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:14.760]  Was there another factor that caused that accident?
[01:55:14.760 --> 01:55:18.040]  Did he decide he just wanted to kill himself at that point because he had already been
[01:55:18.040 --> 01:55:19.040]  shot?
[01:55:19.040 --> 01:55:23.920]  I guess we may or may not get those answers.
[01:55:23.920 --> 01:55:25.320]  But think about this, folks.
[01:55:25.320 --> 01:55:28.080]  Think about this.
[01:55:28.080 --> 01:55:36.000]  On the heels of this attack, you already had multiple Democrats from Congress blaming
[01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.880]  the gun, calling for gun legislation.
[01:55:38.880 --> 01:55:41.960]  But think about this as we're learning more of this event.
[01:55:41.960 --> 01:55:47.720]  If it wasn't for an American citizen with a gun, according to eyewitnesses and their
[01:55:47.720 --> 01:55:53.680]  testimonies, this shooting could have been worse.
[01:55:53.680 --> 01:55:57.520]  Folks, police officers are not on the scene all the time.
[01:55:57.520 --> 01:55:59.040]  They simply cannot be.
[01:55:59.040 --> 01:56:01.080]  It's impossible.
[01:56:01.080 --> 01:56:07.400]  The average response time for police, I think, is around two minutes, OK?
[01:56:07.400 --> 01:56:08.800]  I'm not knocking the police.
[01:56:08.800 --> 01:56:10.080]  They're only human.
[01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:12.200]  They can't be everywhere at once.
[01:56:12.200 --> 01:56:16.720]  If it wasn't for a good citizen, a neighbor that heard the shooting and pulled out his
[01:56:16.720 --> 01:56:24.800]  own rifle, and eyewitnesses believe that it was the neighbor that shot the suspect and
[01:56:24.800 --> 01:56:32.560]  eventually led to the stopping of this mass shooting, that is pretty powerful to think
[01:56:32.560 --> 01:56:35.160]  that this was, and this is Texas, of course.
[01:56:35.160 --> 01:56:36.680]  This has happened before.
[01:56:36.680 --> 01:56:41.000]  Islamic terrorists have been shot dead before they can carry out a mass event.
[01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:46.960]  So while all the Democrats are calling for guns to be taken, calling for gun control,
[01:56:46.960 --> 01:56:51.320]  blaming guns, blaming the Second Amendment, recall what stopped the shooter, according
[01:56:51.320 --> 01:56:58.240]  to eyewitnesses, a good guy with a gun, a citizen with a gun, a rifle that the Democrats
[01:56:58.240 --> 01:57:03.960]  would probably love to take from that citizen that stopped the shooting because they think
[01:57:03.960 --> 01:57:07.240]  that's the answer to ending all this.
[01:57:07.240 --> 01:57:12.600]  So folks, obviously stay tuned, Infowars will be on top of this.
[01:57:12.600 --> 01:57:15.680]  David Knight will give you updates tomorrow morning when he kicks off at 8 a.m.
[01:57:15.680 --> 01:57:18.360]  The Alex Jones Show, obviously 11 central.
[01:57:18.360 --> 01:57:20.040]  Be sure to follow that.
[01:57:20.040 --> 01:57:23.080]  Folks, there's all kinds of other news as well.
[01:57:23.080 --> 01:57:25.200]  Donna Brazil selling out the Clintons.
[01:57:25.200 --> 01:57:28.880]  Brazil saying she feared for her life after Seth Rich was killed.
[01:57:28.880 --> 01:57:32.840]  Apparently Mueller has a couple other indictments looming, one of which may be Podesta.
[01:57:32.840 --> 01:57:34.920]  The rumoring the other one might be Flynn.
[01:57:34.920 --> 01:57:35.920]  We'll see about that.
[01:57:35.920 --> 01:57:40.440]  Trump is expecting to meet with Vladimir Putin on his trip to Asia.
[01:57:40.440 --> 01:57:41.440]  Unbelievable, folks.
[01:57:41.440 --> 01:57:42.440]  This is all going.
[01:57:42.440 --> 01:57:43.440]  Be sure to tune in tomorrow.
[01:57:43.440 --> 01:57:45.920]  And as always, you stay classy, Info Warriors.
[01:57:45.920 --> 01:57:49.200]  Not a group you develop living defense for us.
[01:57:49.200 --> 01:57:50.600]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:57:50.600 --> 01:57:52.320]  Why is this so good?
[01:57:52.320 --> 01:57:57.000]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:01.640]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[01:58:01.640 --> 01:58:02.640]  my system.
[01:58:02.640 --> 01:58:08.640]  Right now, we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body
[01:58:08.640 --> 01:58:10.680]  that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:58:10.680 --> 01:58:15.760]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare
[01:58:15.760 --> 01:58:17.040]  going on everywhere.
[01:58:17.040 --> 01:58:18.040]  These are all parasites.
[01:58:18.040 --> 01:58:20.760]  Tell us about all the stuff that Seth, there's so many things that are in it.
[01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:22.000]  You have the neem in there.
[01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:25.080]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:58:25.080 --> 01:58:28.360]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:58:28.360 --> 01:58:29.360]  All right.
[01:58:29.360 --> 01:58:31.400]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:58:31.400 --> 01:58:32.720]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:58:32.720 --> 01:58:33.720]  Living Defense, infowarslife.com.
[01:58:33.720 --> 01:58:38.360]  And folks, you can't lose full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:58:38.360 --> 01:58:41.640]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[01:58:41.640 --> 01:58:43.840]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.

[01:58:49.120 --> 01:58:52.040]  America is an information-based civil war.
[01:58:52.040 --> 01:58:55.760]  That's why now, more than ever, we've got to hit the streets of America and let these
[01:58:55.760 --> 01:58:59.440]  globalists scum know we're not backing down from their bullies.
[01:58:59.440 --> 01:59:05.800]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their one-of-the-dictatorship.
[01:59:05.800 --> 01:59:11.840]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly
[01:59:11.840 --> 01:59:12.840]  the counterculture.
[01:59:12.840 --> 01:59:19.600]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom
[01:59:19.600 --> 01:59:22.280]  who at the same time is tolerant.
[01:59:22.280 --> 01:59:27.080]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.
[01:59:27.080 --> 01:59:32.400]  They are the anti-liberalists who defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote
[01:59:32.400 --> 01:59:33.400]  freedom worldwide.
[01:59:33.400 --> 01:59:38.920]  We've got more than 60 original designs of high-quality t-shirts for men and women, as
