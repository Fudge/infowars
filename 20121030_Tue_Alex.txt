[00:00.000 --> 00:12.240]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.240 --> 00:38.160]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:38.160 --> 00:44.600]  ladies and gentlemen we are live thank you so much for joining us it is the
[00:44.600 --> 00:52.880]  30th day of October 2012 I am your host Alex Jones and we are going to open the
[00:52.880 --> 00:57.080]  phones up for people that do have power or are able to call in some people have
[00:57.080 --> 01:03.120]  phone service but not power on the East Coast with the hurricane that obviously
[01:03.120 --> 01:08.520]  started to plow in it's causing some damage some flooding cars flooding down
[01:08.520 --> 01:13.400]  the street in New York City subways flooded a lot of people dead I don't
[01:13.400 --> 01:18.040]  know it was like 17 last time I checked we should pray for everybody but they're
[01:18.040 --> 01:21.560]  talking this the ultimate storm in history now and I think that is hype
[01:21.560 --> 01:26.080]  we've seen the media do that before but certainly it's already affecting early
[01:26.080 --> 01:36.400]  voting and things like that and so it is it is absolutely absolutely essential
[01:36.400 --> 01:40.480]  that we continue to track exactly what's happening with this hurricane but
[01:40.480 --> 01:45.920]  also understand they will try to get executive orders through so-called free
[01:45.920 --> 01:56.840]  trade deals through all sorts of things through while we're busy watching this
[01:56.840 --> 02:04.040]  hurricane hurricane Sandy and they will also try to use looting and things like
[02:04.040 --> 02:10.520]  that which has already been some arrests for looting as a pretext to basically
[02:10.520 --> 02:17.120]  restrict all of our liberties I noticed that the New Atlantic magazine wrote an
[02:17.120 --> 02:21.760]  article today making fun of info wars dot com and drudge report dot com implying
[02:21.760 --> 02:25.160]  that there's never any looting and during hurricanes and that we were just
[02:25.160 --> 02:29.920]  horrible people for showing the tweets of folks saying they were gonna loot even
[02:29.920 --> 02:34.760]  though arrest are being made with people looting inside stores and things and I've
[02:34.760 --> 02:40.120]  got all those articles here in front of me also there's a new article breaking an
[02:40.120 --> 02:48.280]  info wars dot com time Warner kills TV show critical of TSA and this is big
[02:48.280 --> 02:52.760]  news because the show talked to scientists in the admissions that the naked
[02:52.760 --> 02:57.080]  body scanners were causing cancer it showed Michael shirt off former head of
[02:57.080 --> 03:02.560]  homeless pretty making money personally off of ordering the scanners and total
[03:02.560 --> 03:06.800]  conflict of interest and time Warner the same folks that own CNN who've been
[03:06.800 --> 03:11.400]  caught by their own reporters that have gone public recently Amber line and
[03:11.400 --> 03:16.960]  others covering up massacres by Arab countries they're friendly towards we're
[03:16.960 --> 03:21.640]  talking about lining up families and shooting them and the media covering that
[03:21.640 --> 03:27.360]  up so time Warner kills TV show critical of TSA episode exposed how body
[03:27.360 --> 03:31.880]  scanners were a major cancer threat and that's a big news we're gonna be getting
[03:31.880 --> 03:39.880]  into that yesterday Facebook now censoring political post as hate
[03:39.880 --> 03:48.080]  speech and all we did was show an image of Bin Laden and say Alciyata and they
[03:48.080 --> 03:50.600]  said that's not allowed and they said if you do it again you will have your
[03:50.600 --> 03:56.840]  account one of many we have with 300 plus thousand people 321,000 signed up for
[03:56.840 --> 04:01.480]  it Facebook now censoring political post as hate speech social network giant
[04:01.480 --> 04:06.160]  threaten to close Alex Jones account over Bin Laden Alciyata image and we've
[04:06.160 --> 04:09.240]  had him shut down other accounts we have that's why I don't know I say we got
[04:09.240 --> 04:13.600]  1520 we got more than that and we've had fans over the years that set up hundreds
[04:13.600 --> 04:17.360]  of them and we had one listener that was doing it that gave us I was more than
[04:17.360 --> 04:22.520]  20 of them he set them up for every film we have every website we have and you
[04:22.520 --> 04:25.400]  know some of them had a hundred thousand two hundred thousand twenty thousand
[04:25.400 --> 04:28.880]  ten thousand three hundred thousand it was all total over a million what this
[04:28.880 --> 04:33.680]  guy handed over to us we didn't really know how to run it but we're trying we're
[04:33.680 --> 04:37.800]  learning and we just linked our articles and stuff and there's no porn
[04:37.800 --> 04:41.720]  there's no calls to violence but we can't say Bin Laden CIA and then linked to an
[04:41.720 --> 04:45.640]  article in the Washington Post admitting it that's just not allowed
[04:45.640 --> 04:51.560]  Aaron McBrain was told with his personal Facebook he had just just just main
[04:51.560 --> 04:55.280]  line news up there and they said that we don't allow politics on Facebook he was
[04:55.280 --> 04:58.960]  given that message and that's in the article to show it's like a third-world

[08:28.720 --> 08:34.640]  Frankenstorm is well been hyped up like it's the end of the world the worst
[08:34.640 --> 08:38.400]  storm in history you've seen the headlines but it is pretty darn bad I
[08:38.400 --> 08:45.800]  mean I have a laundry list of articles here about what is happening with the
[08:45.800 --> 08:51.480]  hurricane I'm gonna list some of those there have been 17 to 18 deaths the
[08:51.480 --> 08:55.680]  numbers are changing all the time there have been troops called out in five
[08:55.680 --> 09:00.120]  states there have been curfews launch there have been mandatory evacuations
[09:00.120 --> 09:04.200]  launch there is flooding of the New York subways store shelves all over the
[09:04.200 --> 09:07.760]  east coast our own Dan badandi went to shot video we're gonna be showing a
[09:07.760 --> 09:13.720]  little bit later we're just rolling over me while I talk here of the store
[09:13.720 --> 09:20.440]  shelves pretty much bear when you talk about Providence Rhode Island where he
[09:20.440 --> 09:23.640]  is based right now he's normally here is one of our reporters he'd gone on a
[09:23.640 --> 09:29.600]  week-long vacation to visit family and he's up there reporting he may be popping
[09:29.600 --> 09:33.840]  in a little bit later in the broadcast as well and again if you're a radio
[09:33.840 --> 09:37.240]  listener that just tuned in you're like we're gonna be showing video over us
[09:37.240 --> 09:45.200]  while we're talking here of Dan there driving around New Haven and drive and
[09:45.200 --> 09:49.880]  then also going back to Rhode Island and driving around Providence Rhode Island
[09:49.880 --> 09:58.120]  there we are also streaming video at prisonplanet.tv and
[09:58.120 --> 10:05.960]  infowarsnews.com what I want to do here ahead of our guests joining us Dr.
[10:05.960 --> 10:13.080]  Nick Begich and Bob Fletcher both icons when it comes to really being among the
[10:13.080 --> 10:18.400]  first to scientifically begin to document that there is massive weather
[10:18.400 --> 10:25.200]  modification going on across the board not just here but worldwide when
[10:25.200 --> 10:30.840]  Begich would talk about this 20 years ago people looked at him like he was a
[10:30.840 --> 10:36.800]  space alien and of course his father it was a famous congressman in Alaska his
[10:36.800 --> 10:42.280]  brother's a US senator currently just an amazing researcher probably the biggest
[10:42.280 --> 10:48.160]  brain out there with documents and facts and patents and the numbers and all the
[10:48.160 --> 10:53.920]  proof and everything that there is a giant global manipulation going on with
[10:53.920 --> 10:58.720]  electromagnetic ground-based systems air-based magnetic systems air-based
[10:58.720 --> 11:04.000]  aerosol chemical systems aluminum dioxide barium salts and other things he's
[11:04.000 --> 11:08.800]  going to be joining us because weather modifications a real thing our government
[11:08.800 --> 11:12.880]  admits they do it five billion dollar a year program that finally got
[11:12.880 --> 11:16.400]  declassified earlier this year but the details are still classified they just
[11:16.400 --> 11:19.960]  admit yeah we spend five billion dollars in one program manipulating the
[11:19.960 --> 11:22.400]  atmosphere we're not gonna tell you what we're doing well we know what you're
[11:22.400 --> 11:28.960]  doing we reverse engineered it and it is diabolical it is not to help people it
[11:28.960 --> 11:32.040]  is to consolidate control the bankers have always wanted to get rid of US
[11:32.040 --> 11:38.440]  farmers and small dairies and ranches and things and they're doing with all
[11:38.440 --> 11:42.440]  this freak weather just like State Department of Random 200 says they'll
[11:42.440 --> 11:46.760]  use war famine you name it to deindustrialize third-world countries
[11:46.760 --> 11:51.120]  that try to industrialize and to shut down food production and kill people and
[11:51.120 --> 11:56.560]  that's was declassified 1991 look it up written by Henry Kissinger show Dr. Nick
[11:56.560 --> 12:00.800]  baggage is joining us so then Bob Fletcher always amazing to give us his
[12:00.800 --> 12:06.120]  take on all of this today but what I want to do right now is go through some of
[12:06.120 --> 12:10.200]  the headlines and then go to your calls for people on the East Coast Dan Badan
[12:10.200 --> 12:15.080]  these are driven around some of the other areas of New England high winds some
[12:15.080 --> 12:20.400]  rain but it hasn't really you know it's gone mainly into Virginia Pennsylvania
[12:20.400 --> 12:25.280]  New Jersey New York and it hasn't really turned fully into New England yet so
[12:25.280 --> 12:34.080]  it's not that bad yet there and thank God but again we're going to be later
[12:34.080 --> 12:38.080]  going over some of that video here for people that are watching at prison
[12:38.080 --> 12:46.040]  planet dot TV of just without audio we'll just roll some of it as he drove
[12:46.040 --> 12:50.520]  around the empty gas stations and again went into the grocery stores and and the
[12:50.520 --> 12:54.560]  food water and things and toilet paper and things were bear I mean why do people
[12:54.560 --> 13:02.120]  run out and get things last minute you see some of the basic stuff is there but
[13:02.120 --> 13:07.520]  the food the the toilet paper you know that's all empty why why why wouldn't
[13:07.520 --> 13:11.160]  people have basic necessities already stocked I mean I've got a basement full
[13:11.160 --> 13:16.960]  of paper towels and and medical supplies and toilet paper and ammunition
[13:16.960 --> 13:22.840]  and storable foods and camping supplies not because I live in fear I try to live
[13:22.840 --> 13:35.480]  I try to live empowered continuing here top East Coast refiner restarting after
[13:35.480 --> 13:41.760]  hurricane Sandy so refineries are already restarting in some areas that's good here
[13:41.760 --> 13:46.400]  is an article out of USA Today Sandy unlikely to postpone election well
[13:46.400 --> 13:51.560]  let's hope that's the case at least 80 fluttered houses destroyed in New York
[13:51.560 --> 13:58.840]  City Fire Wall Street Journal hurricane Sandy losses worse than Irene disaster
[13:58.840 --> 14:03.400]  forecast Reuters hurricane Sandy hundreds evacuated from New York City
[14:03.400 --> 14:10.080]  hospital Fox News hurricane Sandy floods New York City photo show devastation
[14:10.080 --> 14:15.880]  New York Times Northeast suffers huge damage and storms path millions without
[14:15.880 --> 14:21.040]  power continuing this is out of Christian Science Monitor hurricane Sandy
[14:21.040 --> 14:25.680]  predecessor the great hurricane of 1938 what can we learn from it and they say
[14:25.680 --> 14:30.560]  well fires the big danger and some other issues the world is watching global
[14:30.560 --> 14:39.240]  concern over hurricane Sandy at least 18 dead millions without power in Sandy's
[14:39.240 --> 14:43.880]  aftermath the latest number is 18 dead now 17 just 20 minutes ago and
[14:43.880 --> 14:48.440]  obviously they find a lot more dead after that's the that's the really sad
[14:48.440 --> 14:52.760]  thing here is it they found 18 already folks it's probably 50 right now I mean
[14:52.760 --> 14:56.000]  we've had floods in South Texas that killed 35 people in one night in one
[14:56.000 --> 15:00.120]  county so this is probably gonna be pretty bad loss of life wise but nothing
[15:00.120 --> 15:03.520]  better the daily death tolls on the highways I mean the this world's a
[15:03.520 --> 15:07.560]  dangerous place but how to pray for everybody there on the East Coast
[15:07.560 --> 15:12.480]  going through some more of these headlines here curfew enacted in East
[15:12.480 --> 15:20.120]  Haven and that's out of Connecticut so that's in East New Haven a sandpiper
[15:20.120 --> 15:26.640]  restaurant on Cozy Beach Avenue in East Haven is closed but shows a sense of
[15:26.640 --> 15:34.280]  humor as hurricane Sandy moves north go away Sandy and will feed you a lobster
[15:34.280 --> 15:41.920]  roll is the sign there on the facility again Manhattan subway closed cars are
[15:41.920 --> 15:49.800]  floating down the street Washington blog has a report on that first an
[15:49.800 --> 15:55.360]  electricity blackout and now cell phone coverage is down as users in Manhattan
[15:55.360 --> 16:00.120]  battle signal failures and there are some reports I have here of increased
[16:00.120 --> 16:04.440]  robberies and things in New York people using the darkness but no widespread
[16:04.440 --> 16:08.920]  looting there have been a few arrests in New York and other areas for looting and
[16:08.920 --> 16:12.600]  things but there's always some crime going on in any major city but I just
[16:12.600 --> 16:15.960]  want to point out that if you try to loot in places like Texas when hurricanes
[16:15.960 --> 16:19.000]  hit you get killed in fact there's always a lot of people that do get shot
[16:19.000 --> 16:24.320]  trying to loot and it's normally places like Chicago in New York where the
[16:24.320 --> 16:27.960]  criminal governments have disarmed the law abiding citizens that you have the
[16:27.960 --> 16:31.880]  highest crime rates and it's time to free Chicago it's time to free New York
[16:31.880 --> 16:37.880]  great American cities iconic cities from the globalist grip of the crime bosses
[16:37.880 --> 16:42.840]  that want their quarry they're there are victims disarmed thousands of people in
[16:42.840 --> 16:46.000]  Manhattan woke to find they had no cell phone coverage this morning after
[16:46.000 --> 16:48.520]  Superstorm Sandy battered the city's phone maft
[16:48.520 --> 16:52.600]  cell phone users in large swaths of lower Manhattan suffered signal failures
[16:52.600 --> 16:56.920]  have 24 hours of devastating weather for many it means they are virtually cut
[16:56.920 --> 17:01.960]  off and have no way of contacting friends or family or calling for help if
[17:01.960 --> 17:06.600]  there is a future emergencies or further emergencies here's another one
[17:06.600 --> 17:10.840]  Superstorm Sandy leaves millions without power again across tri-state area
[17:10.840 --> 17:17.000]  New York Pennsylvania New Jersey and and other states and more than just three
[17:17.000 --> 17:21.720]  states there that it's a really really really really hitting hitting hard
[17:21.720 --> 17:31.200]  con Edison LIP a PSG JCP and L 4.5 million customers lost power just one
[17:31.200 --> 17:39.760]  area another 670,000 con Edison reporting that 200,000 other area so it's just too
[17:39.760 --> 17:44.520]  many reports seem to be able to follow it all at least 80 flooded houses destroyed
[17:44.520 --> 17:48.420]  again I mentioned that it's one of the biggest things in New York by fire two

[18:31.840 --> 18:35.960]  come and boss everybody around cut down the police communications because the
[18:35.960 --> 18:40.400]  police wouldn't follow their orders to stand down completely in New Orleans and
[18:40.400 --> 18:45.320]  to block them the police and others from other counties were coming in and
[18:45.320 --> 18:48.920]  helping in fire departments from Texas and other areas Louisiana Mississippi
[18:48.920 --> 18:54.240]  from coming into New Orleans and all the other sabotage FEMA did and not getting
[18:54.240 --> 18:57.720]  people aid for six days then going to the high and dry areas and taking the
[18:57.720 --> 19:03.520]  guns and then making people sit in the Superdome while they got raped under
[19:03.520 --> 19:06.880]  orders the police and military sat out there on giant pallets of food and
[19:06.880 --> 19:10.800]  water on record no one was allowed to walk out themselves on the high and dry
[19:10.800 --> 19:14.800]  highways to high and dry areas you would be shot if you tried that just as a
[19:14.800 --> 19:20.840]  pure exercise of raw evil that's what happened most Americans have never heard
[19:20.840 --> 19:24.720]  of the National Response Coordination Center but they're lucky it exists on
[19:24.720 --> 19:28.600]  days of lethal winds and flood dives the center is in the war room of the
[19:28.600 --> 19:32.760]  federal emergency management agency where officials not servants gathered to

[25:06.680 --> 25:15.680]  my witness reports of how bad it is we love to hear from you 800 259 92 31 again
[25:15.680 --> 25:19.720]  just finishing up with this nuclear regulatory commission declares alert at
[25:19.720 --> 25:27.320]  Oyster Creek nuclear plant and the report goes on to say the Oyster Creek plant in
[25:27.320 --> 25:32.160]  New Jersey is the most likely to be affected by the hurricane that's what
[25:32.160 --> 25:36.840]  George Washington blog spot that we posted info wars.com did report yesterday
[25:36.840 --> 25:41.760]  and indeed that is now being affected the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission is
[25:41.760 --> 25:47.280]  conducting and continuing to monitor the impacts for hurricane Sandy on nuclear
[25:47.280 --> 25:54.200]  power plants in the northeastern United States including an alert declared at the
[25:54.200 --> 25:59.080]  Oyster Creek nuclear power plant in New Jersey the plant currently is a
[25:59.080 --> 26:05.480]  regularly scheduled outage declared the alert at approximately 845 p.m. EDT due
[26:05.480 --> 26:10.600]  to water exceeding certain high water level criteria in the plants water
[26:10.600 --> 26:17.400]  intake structure an alert is the second lowest of four in RC action levels the
[26:17.400 --> 26:23.080]  alert was preceded by an unusual event declared at approximately 7 p.m. EDT
[26:23.080 --> 26:28.400]  when the water level first reached a minimum high water level criteria water
[26:28.400 --> 26:34.080]  level is rising in the intake structure due to a combination of rising tide and
[26:34.080 --> 26:39.320]  direction and storm surge it has anticipated water levels will begin to
[26:39.320 --> 26:46.640]  be abate within the next several hours and then AP goes on to report the
[26:46.640 --> 26:51.400]  plant's owner excellent corporations said power was also disrupted in the
[26:51.400 --> 26:55.440]  station switchyard but backup diesel generators as Washington blogspot
[26:55.440 --> 26:59.440]  predicted they would do yesterday and we're providing stable power with more
[26:59.440 --> 27:04.680]  than two weeks of fuel on hand the NRC spokesman said that the flood waters
[27:04.680 --> 27:09.120]  continue to rise it could affect the reactor service water pumps which are
[27:09.120 --> 27:15.000]  used for shutdown cooling and to cool the spent fuel pond let me stop right
[27:15.000 --> 27:21.240]  there here's the issue I think nuclear power overall would be good if you had
[27:21.240 --> 27:26.600]  moral companies and corporations and state governments that would hold them
[27:26.600 --> 27:30.600]  accountable should be the state government doing that but you can look
[27:30.600 --> 27:37.440]  up the numbers it's even mainstream news it's 90 I think it's 92% of reactors of
[27:37.440 --> 27:44.560]  the 416 or whatever it is worldwide that are big power reactors there's hundreds
[27:44.560 --> 27:47.720]  of other research reactors and we're not counting hundreds of nuclear power
[27:47.720 --> 27:53.240]  submarines on both sides of the Atlantic but the point is is that there are
[27:53.240 --> 27:57.320]  400 and some change reactors and most of them are over 30 years old I think the
[27:57.320 --> 28:02.560]  average age what 32 years some are 39 years and they're not meant to go more
[28:02.560 --> 28:10.920]  than 25 years radiation rots things and these things are falling apart and they
[28:10.920 --> 28:17.080]  illegally but they don't get in trouble just store the reactor waste even on top
[28:17.080 --> 28:22.960]  of the new reactors or the new rods and they put them in spent fuel pod ponds you
[28:22.960 --> 28:26.760]  know if if water ever gets out of those those catch on fire and then start
[28:26.760 --> 28:31.480]  blowing up start melting down you've seen Fukushima you've seen Chernobyl you've
[28:31.480 --> 28:35.400]  seen just three-mile island and there are events now routinely bigger than
[28:35.400 --> 28:38.960]  three-mile island and it's not even in the news down in southern California
[28:38.960 --> 28:42.840]  they've had just the last year reactors have had alarms because radiations
[28:42.840 --> 28:47.560]  released they announced you know we're not going to scare the public the you
[28:47.560 --> 28:52.600]  know the federal Department of Energy and others they're gonna just say that
[28:52.600 --> 28:56.640]  we don't have to have the alarms go off anymore oh that's a good idea and when
[28:56.640 --> 29:02.240]  radiation blows in from Fukushima and when the tuna they knew three months in
[29:02.240 --> 29:07.320]  the tuna had had already gotten across the Pacific very quickly and were
[29:07.320 --> 29:10.560]  contaminated with high levels of radiation and it just came out this year
[29:10.560 --> 29:15.200]  almost a year later that oh yeah the feds tested it knew it was radioactive but
[29:15.200 --> 29:19.800]  they decided to not scare people they let people eat the tuna the seals are
[29:19.800 --> 29:26.680]  dying their hair is falling out all over the west coast and and what did the EPA
[29:26.680 --> 29:31.680]  do they just raised the level of what they said was safe isotopes in some
[29:31.680 --> 29:35.960]  cases 1,000% didn't mean that radiation was 1,000% up it's just they
[29:35.960 --> 29:38.960]  if you know what we're just gonna say it's safe now we're gonna say do you say
[29:38.960 --> 29:43.440]  for the trips so that's the problem with nuclear power if society collapses and
[29:43.440 --> 29:50.640]  people walk away from reactors in two weeks they blow up we're on the March
[29:50.640 --> 29:58.320]  the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[31:03.760 --> 31:07.680]  small farmers Americans are losing access not just to raw milk and homemade
[31:07.680 --> 31:10.960]  cheeses but to healthy home-crafted sources for fermented foods like
[31:10.960 --> 31:14.840]  sauerkraut yogurt and kefir it seems there's a war on life-giving foods with
[31:14.840 --> 31:18.280]  living enzymes and healthy bacteria but frankly I'm not sure what the food
[31:18.280 --> 31:21.640]  police are so afraid of these remarkable foods have been around since the beginning
[31:21.640 --> 31:25.000]  of history with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being
[31:25.000 --> 31:29.160]  found across the globe in almost every culture even today Japanese eat miso
[31:29.160 --> 31:33.600]  Africans eat fermented porges Koreans eat kamichi and in India fermented milk
[31:33.600 --> 31:36.960]  is a staple for healthy living but here's some good news self-reliant
[31:36.960 --> 31:40.360]  Americans can now discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented foods

[33:11.440 --> 33:17.720]  you are listening to an info wars dot com frontline report if you are receiving
[33:17.720 --> 33:22.520]  this transmission you are the resistance
[33:28.120 --> 33:31.760]  Alex Jones here back live we're going right to your phone calls here in a
[33:31.760 --> 33:41.480]  moment if you are riders on the storm out on the Great East Coast of America the
[33:41.480 --> 33:49.480]  United States we'd like to hear from you 800-25-99231 we have loaded phone lines
[33:49.480 --> 33:54.320]  here but as soon as you hear a caller hang up that is your cue to be able to
[33:54.320 --> 33:58.120]  call in but again if you're not on the East Coast please give folks a chance on
[33:58.120 --> 34:06.480]  the East Coast to call in I mean it really is a frightening prospect that
[34:06.480 --> 34:14.280]  there are hundreds of reactors in this country 400 plus worldwide and if humans
[34:14.280 --> 34:20.480]  walked away in two weeks on average they would start melting down in two weeks if
[34:20.480 --> 34:25.320]  diesel fuel isn't delivered to the oyster creek facility which is a big
[34:25.320 --> 34:30.720]  nuclear plant on the coast of New Jersey it would go into meltdown now
[34:30.720 --> 34:34.160]  obviously they're gonna get them diesel fuel it's it's not an issue at this
[34:34.160 --> 34:41.280]  time but every time we hear about 90 plus percent of plants leaking I mean now
[34:41.280 --> 34:47.920]  I see it Nebraska or Canada or England or France that radiation levels what just
[34:47.920 --> 34:53.360]  earlier this year went up all over Europe I mean dangerous radiation and it was
[34:53.360 --> 34:57.120]  going yeah no one knows where it's coming from but the maps show it looks
[34:57.120 --> 35:01.360]  like from France and then later it came out yeah a plant kind of was about to
[35:01.360 --> 35:08.440]  melt down so they off-gassed a bunch of radiation sorry that's a big deal I mean
[35:08.440 --> 35:14.160]  back in the 70s and 80s people would freak out over any type of radiation
[35:14.160 --> 35:19.480]  release and rightly they should have they had one out in southern California
[35:19.480 --> 35:24.560]  famous plant just type in California nuclear plant meltdown and it wasn't
[35:24.560 --> 35:32.400]  classified until the 90s how do you classify that a that was a salt reactor
[35:32.400 --> 35:38.240]  how do you classify that it absolutely melted down I mean just type in
[35:38.240 --> 35:42.760]  California nuclear plant that melted down kept secret and you'll get I forget
[35:42.760 --> 35:46.400]  even the name and the details we guys put that in California nuclear meltdown
[35:46.400 --> 35:50.400]  and it'll pop up it's like NBC news ABC news from like three years ago but the
[35:50.400 --> 35:54.880]  point is is that you can look this up it's not even an issue now when they
[35:54.880 --> 36:00.800]  off-gas or leak stuff and it's just like this goes to the core of the New
[36:00.800 --> 36:05.840]  World Order mindset that previous to 1990 they would not let US troops use DU
[36:05.840 --> 36:09.560]  because you breathe that stuff and it's deadly poison not to mention radioactive
[36:09.560 --> 36:15.280]  and they don't look you know have the TSA wearing radiation badges there it is
[36:15.280 --> 36:20.760]  California's historical nuclear meltdown Japan's nuclear crisis has planted
[36:20.760 --> 36:24.640]  indelible memories worldwide and reveals doubts about the health and safety
[36:24.640 --> 36:28.920]  nuclear power it may unsettle many to discover that California to experience
[36:28.920 --> 36:32.880]  the partial nuclear meltdown the accident which occurred in 59 is claimed
[36:32.880 --> 36:36.600]  to have been released more radiation in Three Mile Island yeah no kidding the
[36:36.600 --> 36:39.560]  severity of health impacts on the incident of site workers and those
[36:39.560 --> 36:45.560]  surrounding community is still being debated today and that's a site click on
[36:45.560 --> 36:49.160]  that I think that link goes to NBC where it says nuclear power crisis yeah
[36:49.160 --> 36:55.000]  yeah right there and it yeah yeah that's a that's a report on it now that's a
[36:55.000 --> 36:59.000]  report on Japan go back I want to find out the exact name of that the point is
[36:59.000 --> 37:04.440]  you can go look it up all right I'm ranting I said I'd go to your calls
[37:04.440 --> 37:07.640]  coming up in the next segment and we'll continue with calls throughout the
[37:07.640 --> 37:16.680]  broadcast for our guests we have a piece that we shot last week that John
[37:16.680 --> 37:20.680]  Bowne directed and put together did a great job there's two pieces actually
[37:20.680 --> 37:24.920]  we're in error one today one tomorrow and that the rest the crew did a great
[37:24.920 --> 37:29.000]  job on great camera work by the whole crew David Knight everybody to see the
[37:29.000 --> 37:33.080]  whole crew working together so exciting and yeah it's it's zombies folks and
[37:33.080 --> 37:36.360]  it's it's pointing out that the public is becoming zombie like in their brain
[37:36.360 --> 37:40.800]  waves and becoming zombie like in their mindset and so we're going to air that
[37:40.800 --> 37:46.040]  little short piece part one coming up in the next segment so you if you're not a
[37:46.040 --> 37:49.200]  prison planet TV viewer you might want to go over to prison planet TV so you
[37:49.200 --> 37:54.200]  can see it premiere but never fair to the radio audience later today we will
[37:54.200 --> 37:59.320]  post it up at info wars calm and present on a dot com for everybody I will do
[37:59.320 --> 38:03.080]  that like an hour after we first premiere it here for people watching at
[38:03.080 --> 38:13.200]  prison planet dot TV but again my issue is we don't know when plants have
[38:13.200 --> 38:18.440]  problems now because universities will go hey we're getting you know 67 times or
[38:18.440 --> 38:22.680]  125 times if you can see these reports but it's not even like it's news it's
[38:22.680 --> 38:26.520]  like saying some guy dropped his shoe in the road and nobody cares or hey they
[38:26.520 --> 38:31.880]  got a you know a sale on ground chuck at when Dixie I mean it's just a minor they
[38:31.880 --> 38:35.800]  report it like it's nothing decades later semi-valley nuclear meltdown still
[38:35.800 --> 38:38.800]  impacts lives yeah that's where it happened in 59 and I mean look at the
[38:38.800 --> 38:43.960]  plan I mean it blew up it melted down I mean even the media white washes the
[38:43.960 --> 38:48.720]  fact that that that it was a near complete meltdown and they kept it
[38:48.720 --> 38:55.120]  secret until a few years ago that's what makes me mad is that I grew up
[38:55.120 --> 38:58.840]  believing commies didn't want us to have nuclear power and nuclear power is a
[38:58.840 --> 39:02.440]  great thing let me tell you it isn't a great thing and now they're launching
[39:02.440 --> 39:06.240]  all these spacecraft with it on top of rockets up into the atmosphere think of
[39:06.240 --> 39:10.840]  one of those things blows up if it if it if it falls into orbit and heats up and
[39:10.840 --> 39:14.600]  we get a nice little radiation burst well they don't care because now they
[39:14.600 --> 39:19.840]  just say hey you can have 25 times cesium 9 or whatever it is you can have
[39:19.840 --> 39:23.640]  200 times this you have a thousand times I mean they had dozens of isotopes they
[39:23.640 --> 39:28.200]  listed well this can be a thousand times higher than what we said before I mean do
[39:28.200 --> 39:31.320]  you government bureaucrats really think you're gonna get out of what you're
[39:31.320 --> 39:37.000]  doing to us you lunatics or you these nuclear power company owners and these
[39:37.000 --> 39:41.520]  crazy shareholders crazy shareholders of private nuclear plants that want to be
[39:41.520 --> 39:45.600]  able to sell their du and and you know the military already bought 50 years of
[39:45.600 --> 39:49.240]  it had it so much of its stock piled they they didn't know what to do or they
[39:49.240 --> 39:53.000]  said well let's just start using it and the scientist on record all went in the
[39:53.000 --> 39:57.960]  military brass went you can't use that it's it's deadly poisonous all our
[39:57.960 --> 40:02.280]  studies show it'll it gives the rats cancer it's deformities and gives them
[40:02.280 --> 40:06.840]  lung cancer you can't use it it ignites in the in the barrel whether it's from
[40:06.840 --> 40:14.880]  an Abram Sabo or whether it's five from a 50 cal Barrett system and they don't
[40:14.880 --> 40:19.760]  care they just have this it's it's it's it's psycho ladies and gentlemen I got
[40:19.760 --> 40:26.040]  to say this last night I was sitting there reading books to my children and I
[40:26.040 --> 40:32.880]  looked into my four-year-old daughter's eyes and she was so innocent and so good
[40:32.880 --> 40:38.640]  that it hurts so bad to know that she's gonna grow up in this corrupt
[40:38.640 --> 40:46.360]  degenerating world and it was so painful it is so painful to know how
[40:46.360 --> 40:53.240]  important a trust this radio show is and how imperfect and out of control I am
[40:53.240 --> 40:57.080]  and the fact that I I am not living up to one-tenth of my potential but I'm
[40:57.080 --> 41:04.720]  trying it is just just the absolute total drive in my spirit to want to serve
[41:04.720 --> 41:08.880]  and protect the innocent and to want to be wholesome and good and then to have
[41:08.880 --> 41:12.920]  to look into my wicked heart which compared to most people if you look to
[41:12.920 --> 41:16.360]  my heart think that guy's a saint well no I know how wicked I am just that I know
[41:16.360 --> 41:21.320]  evil itself people hear me sometimes get dark and they go man he sounds like a
[41:21.320 --> 41:27.320]  really crazy psychopath well yes I I can stare into evil and let me tell you
[41:27.320 --> 41:31.240]  I don't like what I see but you know what it's there the difference is I know
[41:31.240 --> 41:36.760]  the good from the bad I cannot imagine people that want to hurt innocent
[41:36.760 --> 41:41.880]  children but they see the innocence and want to destroy it and feed on it and
[41:41.880 --> 41:45.640]  I'm just telling you folks I've seen the enemy I know the enemy they are
[41:45.640 --> 41:50.560]  pathetic and weak and I am sick of strong people standing down and letting
[41:50.560 --> 41:55.840]  evil control this planet I am tired of it I am sick of it I would rather God
[41:55.840 --> 41:59.800]  destroy this planet everybody on it then let these innocent children be
[41:59.800 --> 42:03.200]  slowly tortured and killed by the globalist and again I want the planet
[42:03.200 --> 42:07.320]  to not be destroyed and I want you know the future to go forward and I would you
[42:07.320 --> 42:12.320]  know never commit suicide that's not my point I'm saying all over the world the
[42:12.320 --> 42:16.600]  globalists are setting up a planetary dictatorship so they can hurt innocent
[42:16.600 --> 42:22.440]  people so they can hurt the infirm so they can hurt women and children so
[42:22.440 --> 42:26.480]  they can hurt the innocence that this whole thing wants to hurt innocence
[42:26.480 --> 42:34.200]  because real evil hates innocence innocence beauty goodness purity it's so
[42:34.200 --> 42:39.920]  good it's so good and we those of us that are strong have got to literally
[42:39.920 --> 42:45.040]  throw ourselves against the enemy and I know you're good I know you have power
[42:45.040 --> 42:50.120]  out there and I want to see you turn it loose on these people I want to crush
[42:50.120 --> 42:56.880]  them not because I have some hateful rage I want to remove the attacking
[42:56.880 --> 43:00.800]  jackals that are ripping our little ones to pieces and hurting our species and
[43:00.800 --> 43:05.320]  killing our women it makes me angry when I hear about women and that have
[43:05.320 --> 43:09.000]  cancer when they're young especially and to know it's engineered it makes me
[43:09.000 --> 43:12.240]  angry to see children with cancer alright I said I go to your calls on the
[43:12.240 --> 43:17.200]  east coast I apologize I appreciate you calling in Jason New York you're on the
[43:17.200 --> 43:23.580]  air go ahead welcome hey Alex thanks for having me thank you for calling so my
[43:23.580 --> 43:28.960]  biggest goal is that I've been preparing you know for all kinds of
[43:28.960 --> 43:35.080]  disasters and including global financial collapse the last two years so my
[43:35.080 --> 43:39.160]  friends and family you know who have woken up and are aware and see what's
[43:39.160 --> 43:44.720]  going on you know it started out just hey just prepare for a winter storm or
[43:44.720 --> 43:49.480]  you know we didn't have the hurricane last year and nobody cared like nobody's
[43:49.480 --> 43:53.080]  done anything since then and it really upset me it really bothered me you know
[43:53.080 --> 43:56.440]  that I called and checked on everybody this morning down along Island my mom
[43:56.440 --> 44:01.920]  moves 15 miles away from Indian Point and I said you know how come you don't
[44:01.920 --> 44:06.120]  have a hundred gallons of water stored already like how come you didn't get out
[44:06.120 --> 44:13.480]  of there bears foxes wolves lions tigers they all eat their fill and then bury
[44:13.480 --> 44:20.360]  the carcass to come back and eat it later ants store food most insects store
[44:20.360 --> 44:25.600]  food all humans have always stored food and water as backups and the government
[44:25.600 --> 44:29.680]  until recently when they were shamed into it shed people that are prepping
[44:29.680 --> 44:34.760]  are bad now they say yeah have a week of food and water again they do not want us
[44:34.760 --> 44:40.160]  self-sufficient it's not that we're in fear that we're prepared it's not for
[44:40.160 --> 44:47.120]  fear that I've got a gun under my desk it's that I'm living empowered and exactly
[44:47.120 --> 44:51.480]  what you're saying I've seen news reports of the store shelves cleaned and I know
[44:51.480 --> 44:55.760]  New York City's flooding what reports can you give us on that front part of it
[44:55.760 --> 45:00.840]  was just leaving it that almost I think they just opened up a couple bridges
[45:00.840 --> 45:05.600]  they're talking about oh Indian power plants fine you know it's there's no
[45:05.600 --> 45:09.000]  problem there we've got everything under control we're not worried about it at
[45:09.000 --> 45:15.120]  all that the cops are out in full force stay off the streets stay where you are
[45:15.120 --> 45:18.880]  but at the same time they want you to report to these you know refugee Red
[45:18.880 --> 45:25.560]  Cross FEMA camp centers so you know it's conflicting the whole time yeah it's
[45:25.560 --> 45:33.600]  just totally backwards anything else you'd like to answer you know I just
[45:33.600 --> 45:36.720]  wish that people would pay attention you know like take it seriously don't take
[45:36.720 --> 45:40.000]  it for granted don't be the lazy kid out there and you know you're just saving
[45:40.000 --> 45:43.520]  your two liter bottles and fill them up with water so you can flush your toilet
[45:43.520 --> 45:49.720]  you know do something anyway that's it thank you so much and God bless you yeah
[45:49.720 --> 45:53.320]  you know we've just come out with a strategic relocation film with myself and
[45:53.320 --> 45:57.360]  Joe Scalzen mainly Joe Scalzen that Rob Jacobson and Darren McBrain decided a
[45:57.360 --> 46:05.120]  superlative job on and you know in the trailer we're talking about the nuclear
[46:05.120 --> 46:09.160]  threat because that's that's higher than it's ever been but that's a small part
[46:09.160 --> 46:13.840]  of the film it gets into the political geopolitical three power blocks and it
[46:13.840 --> 46:18.680]  gets into every major city and then every region in every state just like the
[46:18.680 --> 46:21.760]  book does but even more in some areas the two complement each other and
[46:21.760 --> 46:25.640]  explaining if you've got to live in New York City or Los Angeles the real
[46:25.640 --> 46:29.400]  escape routes the general public doesn't know about I mean it's a roadmaps
[46:29.400 --> 46:33.080]  that's what strategic relocation the book that we sell discounted with the
[46:33.080 --> 46:37.840]  film covers the secure home all of this you know and it's got stuff people that
[46:37.840 --> 46:41.640]  have to shelter in place all the way up to the deal and it's because as a human
[46:41.640 --> 46:45.400]  you're supposed to think about these things because you're a father you're a
[46:45.400 --> 46:49.960]  mother it's your responsibility to start thinking about your surroundings don't
[46:49.960 --> 46:53.280]  just think it's just there and the lights are always going to be on that's
[46:53.280 --> 46:58.640]  what an empowered conscious person does a zombie doesn't let's go to bill in
[46:58.640 --> 47:03.520]  Pennsylvania hard hit by the storm bill is this all hype or a little bit of
[47:03.520 --> 47:08.760]  hype or how bad is it Alex I'm gonna start real quick I know you don't like
[47:08.760 --> 47:13.360]  pats on the back but I found you by accidents four years ago and you and
[47:13.360 --> 47:17.480]  your show has changed the life of being my family and we thank you for that thank
[47:17.480 --> 47:22.400]  you you're welcome sir I'll tell you what you could kind of see it coming
[47:22.400 --> 47:26.720]  yesterday we had a lot of wind here I'm three miles north of Philadelphia and
[47:26.720 --> 47:33.560]  it started yesterday afternoon they shut the bridges down from Pennsylvania to
[47:33.560 --> 47:39.560]  New Jersey for commercial vehicles and then it's seven o'clock last night
[47:39.560 --> 47:46.280]  Governor Corbett he closed every route in the Philadelphia which is like every
[47:46.280 --> 47:50.200]  hard way to get into Philadelphia you couldn't get in and you couldn't get
[47:50.200 --> 47:56.440]  out that's what the military's been training for forever you know I heard
[47:56.440 --> 48:00.320]  Dan Badandi during the money bomb he broadcasted for seven hours of our
[48:00.320 --> 48:05.320]  reporters back visiting family I heard him in the halls on air here tell the
[48:05.320 --> 48:10.280]  story of being in an airport and talking to a listener who was a FEMA pretty you
[48:10.280 --> 48:14.000]  mid-level who showed him maps and how there'd be a natural disaster during the
[48:14.000 --> 48:19.120]  election and how it be used and how he had to mobilize thousands of buses and
[48:19.120 --> 48:23.320]  all this and then we don't have the crew so we've been scrambling all morning you
[48:23.320 --> 48:27.520]  know just trying to even find that the seven hours of the money bomb versus his
[48:27.520 --> 48:31.480]  blog talk show he had before and then Dan is there with his one-year-old son
[48:31.480 --> 48:36.560]  and his wife so he only he only you know is scrambling around trying to find it
[48:36.560 --> 48:40.920]  but I mean I heard him tell that story I heard him say that that FEMA said we
[48:40.920 --> 48:43.680]  don't know what it is but something during the election we've heard all the
[48:43.680 --> 48:47.960]  cops call in and say that too and I don't know if this is it it's just very
[48:47.960 --> 48:52.160]  strange that that's on record our listeners could go through all the
[48:52.160 --> 48:58.000]  money bomb video a 48 hour broadcast that we did with Dan Badandi did seven
[48:58.000 --> 49:01.080]  hours of it or like six and a half hours total that's all it in four is money
[49:01.080 --> 49:04.160]  bomb calm we don't have the crew to find it so I just said well we can't have
[49:04.160 --> 49:07.440]  Dan on to play that and then have him talk about it because you know if you
[49:07.440 --> 49:10.640]  don't have the proof you can't show it doesn't matter we all you know he talked
[49:10.640 --> 49:15.560]  about it on YouTube as videos but doesn't exist but the point is is that
[49:15.560 --> 49:20.600]  they're certainly using this as a power grab in areas where it's not even a
[49:20.600 --> 49:23.720]  problem I see areas where it's barely raining and they're using it to have
[49:23.720 --> 49:27.040]  troops on the street but then you can argue well what if they didn't people
[49:27.040 --> 49:29.480]  are saying they were gonna loot what do you think of the people threatening to
[49:29.480 --> 49:34.560]  loot during this well exactly I think a lot of it like I just said with Ron
[49:34.560 --> 49:38.000]  neither they're not gonna do anything they're kind of hoping for it the town
[49:38.000 --> 49:42.280]  chipped it on then there's a hundred thousand people we have way too many
[49:42.280 --> 49:46.680]  police force a hundred percent militarized we have an armored personal
[49:46.680 --> 49:52.400]  troop carrier we have a gigantic mobile homes that are converted into a
[49:52.400 --> 49:57.000]  stationary bases these guys were running around the disc town yesterday they
[49:57.000 --> 50:01.280]  were licking their chops Alex they were licking your chops they couldn't wait to
[50:01.280 --> 50:05.200]  kick people out of their houses we had some evacuations in some parts of the
[50:05.200 --> 50:09.960]  town but they were they were running around like like animals yesterday like
[50:09.960 --> 50:12.960]  they couldn't they couldn't wait to use the toys that they had they just had to
[50:12.960 --> 50:17.320]  sell a boat that they bought because they could only use it on a small portion
[50:17.320 --> 50:20.560]  of the Delaware River and they had to sell it so now it's like they're trying
[50:20.560 --> 50:24.120]  to make a case for using the rest of the boys all over the country homeland
[50:24.120 --> 50:30.320]  security with our money is buying speed boats with heavy machine guns mounted
[50:30.320 --> 50:34.760]  for millions of dollars or like 700,000 apiece the ones that Texas
[50:34.760 --> 50:38.720]  Department of Safety got and now they're throwing them on main lakes show gun boats
[50:38.720 --> 50:43.280]  come up to you because these guys all want to be soldiers and of course now

[01:00:52.760 --> 01:01:01.960]  it well I'm actually not too bad I'm a local county and just a few down trees a
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:07.320]  few down lines but nothing really out of the normal I personally think most of
[01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:11.960]  the storm was hyped up but perhaps for my area I'm not too sure about the East
[01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:20.080]  Coast well good what's your overall take on the situation well I found a
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:26.440]  situation opportunity to test to see how well my own preparedness would be for
[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:30.720]  such an emergency so I treated as if it was a full emergency even though I knew
[01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:36.600]  it wasn't to see what type of supplies actually might be deficient and I'm
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:48.200]  pretty down pretty well in terms of survival gear I just can't believe what
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:51.800]  the earlier caller talked about that that people try to go to the storm with
[01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:55.920]  hours the toilet paper and water was gone I mean people had like a week with
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:58.640]  the storm coming to already go out and get that I mean what are people
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:02.560]  thinking it's scary to think how dependent people are good to hear you're
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:06.360]  doing okay there in Pennsylvania Lisa in mass thanks for holding you're on the
[01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:11.760]  air hello can you hear me yes ma'am hi Alex how are you today I'm good good
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:16.640]  hearing your voice if somebody asked me about my own experience for this
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:21.560]  hurricane I would have to say that it was really a nothing storm well I mean I
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:25.320]  was looking the last few they call them super horrible and stuff and it does
[01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:30.160]  look like hype unless you're in lower Manhattan it's all flooded so but they
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:33.760]  they showed on the news the town of situate which was flooding it's a
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:38.360]  coastal town and the police went door-to-door offering to take people out
[01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:44.000]  of their homes and everybody refused well that is always heartening that most
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:48.960]  people may be dumbed down but they know to not listen to the government sorry
[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:55.720]  proud of the town of situate for refusing but yeah we got barely any wind
[01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:59.240]  we get a little rain and then it would be quiet for hours and then it would
[01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:06.720]  rain a little again so I mean Dan badandi is in Rhode Island and I saw
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:09.840]  articles saying Rhode Island hard hit me goes man it's barely blowing in fact

[01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:28.480]  obviously it is an issue we should pray for everybody and kind of like Katrina

[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:31.440]  if you see the different Doppler radar satellite shots of the hurricane or
[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:37.000]  tropical storm it's pretty spectacular shitting right over Pennsylvania it
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:42.360]  looks like the eye of the storm and it is just hammering all the way up into the
[01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:47.360]  Great Lakes region all the way up into Canada a ton of rain you know out over
[01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:53.480]  West Virginia and down into the Carolinas with a little bit of rain and
[01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:57.040]  it is flooding New York City and some other areas there's been upwards of 20
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:09:03.560]  deaths now but I've got to say unless the flooding just really mounts this looks
[01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:08.680]  like a bunch of hype I'll tell you right now and that's good because I hope it
[01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:12.000]  doesn't postpone the election like US News & World Report was saying it could
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:18.320]  because if it was as bad as the media was saying then it would have been a
[01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:25.240]  serious catastrophe basically and it is flooding areas of New Jersey and New
[01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:29.360]  York it is knocking power out to six million people now they're saying or
[01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:35.400]  more so it's a big deal but worse storm in history total devastation you know
[01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:40.160]  cats and dogs living together into the world wrath of God type of stuff as they
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:45.920]  say in Ghostbusters we're talking about wrath of God type of stuff from mayor
[01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:54.080]  fire and brimstone dead rising from the graves cats and dogs living together we
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:58.000]  are not we are not seeing that unless you're the 20 dead people so it is very
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.320]  very serious for them we should pray pray for everybody but I mean the media has
[01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:05.200]  just hyped this but let's talk before we go to Dr. Nick Maggots today Dave in
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:10.760]  New York who says he's a first responder EMT emergency medical technician to give
[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:16.320]  us a his take a New York City state or the city or the state New York New York
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:19.560]  is a near a New York New York that's the one spot you could say is the worst
[01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:24.000]  off from what I've seen the news Dave where are you located in New York yeah
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.760]  I was located in the Coney Island Brooklyn Alex it's like we're basically like the
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:33.760]  heart of the storm here it was bad the water basically got up to our waist you
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:37.960]  know we were trying to go around trying to save people you know you know but they
[01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:42.040]  had like the zone 8 part of Brooklyn Coney Island where people were told
[01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:47.040]  to evacuate obviously people didn't listen and didn't think that the flood
[01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:52.440]  was bad Alex we were like maybe two miles away from the ocean I mean like the
[01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:57.320]  water was deep around our waist I mean we're watching tidal waves in the
[01:10:57.320 --> 01:11:01.720]  streets I mean I couldn't believe it you know I've been in combat in Afghanistan
[01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:06.680]  using the Marines and I was shocked to what I've seen and people the public
[01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:11.400]  brain dead running to try to move their cars I mean I could have we tell you
[01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:15.680]  just make the point I made the point that if you're you know a hundred miles
[01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:19.680]  inshore and you're not low sea level you don't need to evacuate and I was
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:23.640]  telling the lady you know that makes no sense but yeah I mean if you're right on
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:28.480]  the coast and a hurricane's coming in unless you live in armored fortress 50
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:31.640]  feet off the ground it's smart to get out of there and I've you know I've been
[01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:34.520]  at the coast when there's a hurricane before I was stupid enough in college
[01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:37.880]  to go down there and it was a small hurricane I think only about 80 90
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:42.560]  mile an hour winds and it was scary to see those waves coming in and starting
[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:46.160]  to come over you know the pool in the hotel you're saying you've been in
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:52.680]  combat and and are you saying this was scarier um yeah exactly I mean I'm
[01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:56.160]  watching tidal waves in the streets of New York you know and that the sewers
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:12:01.320]  popping open water flying everywhere and like I said I've never seen and this was
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:05.400]  like basically our Hurricane Katrina obviously the callers will call you
[01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:08.440]  they didn't experience what we experienced because like I said anybody
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:13.760]  who was in the New York City area near the Rockaways of Queens or like lower
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:18.640]  Manhattan and like Brooklyn basically got flooded I mean there were cars in the
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:22.400]  streets floating around that's confirmable then let me ask you this
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:27.920]  question I just started the hour saying mainly media hype would you say I'm
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:31.000]  wrong I mean they're calling this the worst form ever is this the worst thing
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:34.840]  you've ever seen in New York yes this is the worst thing I've ever seen I mean I
[01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:38.360]  had like a guy who's been working with me he's been you know he's a little bit
[01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:42.080]  older than me and you know he used to live around here and he told me he'd seen
[01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:45.600]  many hurricanes and he never seen anything like that I mean like I said the
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:49.960]  water was just rising so quickly you know like I said I've never seen anything
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:54.080]  like that in my life and one thing like I said Alex about the brain dead zombies
[01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:58.320]  you had people leaving their houses trying to go move their cars trying to
[01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:02.080]  save their cars we're telling them to go back to your house your life is more
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:04.880]  important in your car you don't have to worry about it I mean you couldn't
[01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:08.000]  believe how many people are trying to move their cars like going in like you
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:13.000]  know water up to their waist Alex crazy Wow yeah no I saw it on the news and
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.880]  I've seen the photos we've got it up at info wars.com drudge report.com has it
[01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:23.080]  as well and so again other than New York though and some coastal areas of New
[01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:27.680]  Jersey from what I've seen it is not the mega disaster they said but it's kind of
[01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:31.840]  like people argue is it a depression or a recession well if you've got a job it's
[01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:35.120]  a recession if you've been out of work for six months it's a depression so for
[01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:40.880]  you you live in there in New York this is a disaster yeah exactly I mean you you
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:45.240]  see like cars told cars left and right because you know when salt water gets
[01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:48.800]  in the you know in the engines you know it you know it's told right then and
[01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:51.840]  there I mean what about the zombie point because I saw that in the news too
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:59.960]  you're saying you witnessed people trying to go in and move their cars in
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:04.240]  three feet of water yes yes I witnessed that like trying to move it to high
[01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:08.760]  ground basically you know I mean I'm telling people not to go whatever in
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:12.760]  the direction the water is coming up higher and they're not listening and you
[01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:17.960]  know you can get a new car you can't get a new body exactly exactly exactly
[01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:22.480]  exactly and then even today the aftermath in the morning you see people
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:26.120]  just walking around you know just lolly jagging you know I'm saying like with a
[01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:30.200]  zombie looking at hi I mean it's and they're like oh we need help what we're
[01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:34.320]  gonna do you know this or whatever you know and there's only so much you could
[01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:37.960]  do you know and like all morning long we've just been rescuing people that
[01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:43.720]  stayed in their houses basically you know that didn't listen well I mean the
[01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:47.080]  issue is if you've got a big you know serious stone house that's what stood
[01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:50.840]  stuff before and you got three stories I mean you might be safe if the roof
[01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:56.160]  doesn't blow off but yeah you know the issue is is that you take things like
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:15:02.320]  Katrina where people are high and dry and they got you know taken away by the
[01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:05.760]  military and again that's the problem of the government response even if the
[01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:10.400]  government means well there's no way to implement it properly because no one
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:14.760]  has the humet or the human intelligence everywhere no matter what computers
[01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:18.560]  they've got there's no telling what is exactly going to happen till it the
[01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:22.280]  hammer gets dropped what about looting I've seen a few arrests with stuff in
[01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:27.440]  New York and other areas or are the thieves not taking advantage of it
[01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:30.840]  because it's so dangerous to go out in the streets that are literally like
[01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:36.400]  rivers as far as I see everything is orderly nobody's been you know looting
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:40.520]  anything like that right now this is day one obviously so we have to wait you
[01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:44.080]  know because they say power is gonna be out at least maybe two weeks here this
[01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:48.120]  is who this is what they're saying New York City how many are New York City and
[01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:52.440]  all the boroughs eight million nine million yeah about eight I say about
[01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:55.480]  eight to ten million people actually okay okay let's say let's just say nine
[01:15:55.480 --> 01:16:00.880]  million people roughly there where's the election nine million people aren't gonna
[01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:08.280]  vote now yeah I mean well you know what New York State is democratic anyway so
[01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:11.320]  you know I mean it's for you know Obama so they really doesn't make a
[01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:15.160]  difference you know sure but US News and World Report said that it would help
[01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:18.800]  Romney but more and more even if New York and New Jersey can't vote and
[01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:23.400]  they're historically mainly Democrat they've got Republican governor there in
[01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:27.160]  New Jersey who shut who canceled Halloween so you can have all the candy
[01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:32.160]  bars the joke is well listen sir thank you so much for your update would you
[01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:36.880]  like to give your cell phone number to John Harmon up there at Genesis so that
[01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:41.640]  we can call you for updates in the next few days okay no problem yeah yeah I'll
[01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:45.880]  do that thank you so much thank you and God bless and be safe their day so pray
[01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:50.760]  for everybody like I said New York and New Jersey and other areas there's 20
[01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:55.520]  people dead now so yeah the media's overhyped it but mainly because there
[01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:58.380]  was the potential this thing could have done this every and it may keep
[01:16:58.380 --> 01:17:01.480]  branding and may do this all over the place I mean you know we don't know yet
[01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:06.320]  I am just not gonna jump the gun and say it's the biggest disaster ever until
[01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:10.360]  we're totally sure but let me tell you a lot can happen in the next six seven
[01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:14.600]  days before the election we're now six and a half days out from this I
[01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:18.120]  apologize for going to him 15 minutes late he's there with us for the rest of
[01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:22.680]  the hour his website's earthpulse.com Dr. Nick Begich is a well known for his
[01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:26.240]  work on research on harp mind effects and more he's widely reported in these
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:29.640]  areas as an expert for many publications government organizations and
[01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:33.840]  private companies he's testified and advised the EU you name and he's also
[01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:38.320]  been a tribal affairs leader his father of course the famous US congressman his
[01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:42.600]  brother is a currently serving US senator in Washington DC he's been an
[01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:46.600]  expert witness again as I mentioned the European Parliament best-selling author
[01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:50.840]  researcher and he's the guy that proved with the research that harp and
[01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:54.880]  weather modification was going on with the facts not speculation we only got a
[01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:59.120]  few minutes for break here doc but out of the gates weather modification air
[01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:03.840]  based ground based heart based now they admit Dubai and Saudi Arabia control the
[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:08.760]  weather the Russians what do you think looking at this storm dr. Begich well
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:14.240]  you know once again it's a case of not enough independent monitoring really to
[01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:18.080]  know to what extent you know man might be involved in this but this is a very
[01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:22.720]  technology that I've been reporting on now for for 15 years and it's just gotten
[01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:29.000]  better and better in fact in 2007 my last conversations with dr. East on the
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:33.760]  inventor inventor of harp had whole new theories about weather modification what
[01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:39.520]  was possible in fact 1600 times less energy than he originally thought was
[01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:44.560]  needed when he invented harp in fact you can modify weather so pretty profound
[01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:48.080]  technologies I'm sure during the course of the hour we'll get plenty of time to
[01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:53.120]  talk about them a lot of ways to do this today and and even to steer it but the
[01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:57.880]  problem is modeling figuring out what the effects are when one country plays
[01:18:57.880 --> 01:19:03.680]  with this the effects are unpredictable and and oftentimes disastrous and of
[01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:06.680]  course as you know I'm gonna just skip this network break because we got you on
[01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:09.920]  late I want to give you the full time here so you can get rolling now dr.
[01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:14.560]  Begich breaking this down talk about the basics for people that don't know this
[01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:19.040]  is real because you know ABC News makes jokes about it while separately running
[01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:23.040]  articles about Bill Gates having a company to create or be able to kill
[01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:27.720]  hurricanes talk about the different weather treaties talk about some of the
[01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:32.280]  basic patents in science talk about the fact that hey this this does exist and
[01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:35.920]  as you said a bunch of governments admit they're doing it so how does that all
[01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:41.040]  have a chain reaction butterfly effect well first of all going back to you know
[01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:44.120]  the whole issue of weather modification the US has been involved in this for
[01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:49.080]  many many years in fact I'll quote one quote I used it in earth rising the
[01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:52.720]  revolution and it's by Secretary of Defense William Cohen when he was in
[01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:59.440]  office back in 1997 now this is before the 9-11 event and he said and I quote
[01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:04.720]  others are engaging in even in an ecotype of terrorism whereby they can
[01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:08.200]  alter climates set up earthquakes and volcanoes remotely through the use of
[01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:14.600]  electromagnetic waves unquote now that's at a time before 9-11 attributing the
[01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:18.160]  technology to terrorist states what he's really talking about is the idea of
[01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:22.360]  being able to move or manipulate weather for strategic advantage and it was
[01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:26.800]  Rumsfeld who suggested that our treaty we had a treaty that we assigned with
[01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:32.880]  60 other countries back in the 1970s where we wouldn't use geophysical
[01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:38.800]  manipulation or weather warfare if you will and those treaties he wanted to
[01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:44.040]  see him eliminated but the fact is all of those treaties from that era allow for
[01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:49.160]  and most instances domestic use and this one in particular meaning you could
[01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:52.800]  modify weather in your own nation you just can't do it you know against
[01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:57.320]  someone else in a warfare scenario the problem is weather's connected I mean
[01:20:57.320 --> 01:21:00.960]  you look at a storm and where they originate and where they end up they
[01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:04.800]  don't respect political boundaries certainly yeah Japan can't pass a law
[01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:09.800]  that its Fukushima radiation won't hit the west coast right exactly right but
[01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:13.120]  you can manipulate you know you can manipulate within your own boundaries
[01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:17.080]  and many countries are in fact is hit mainstream media number times the
[01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:23.120]  Russians at one point Russian company offered to clear smoke out of Malaysia
[01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:27.240]  and Indonesia years ago when there was those huge fires down there that were
[01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:32.400]  just choking Malaysia they agreed to or offered any way to create an old
[01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:36.080]  artificial cyclone and that was you know some mainstream media picked up on
[01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:40.520]  that and quickly forgot it but show this is years and years ago what we can do
[01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:44.760]  today is much more profound in fact even manipulating gravity waves which is
[01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:49.720]  something Eastland ended his work in before he passed away in 2007 he had
[01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:54.000]  delivered a paper to the University of Pennsylvania previously did work on this
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:59.480]  for the European Space Agency NASA even FEMA interestingly enough on weather
[01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:03.400]  modification and in all of those instances what he essentially showed is
[01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:07.640]  how to do it and he said look and he said this to me and he said this to a
[01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:11.720]  number of others is he was unwilling at the state in which he recognized the
[01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:15.920]  technology to give it to say military planners from standpoint that the
[01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:20.680]  destructive effects the unpredictable effects were so profound and our lack of
[01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:24.720]  ability to model these on a global scale I mean to look at all the factors that
[01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:30.440]  contribute to climate and and the effect of climate in one place versus how it
[01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:34.440]  affects everything else he recognized we couldn't do it if we ever were going to
[01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:38.320]  do weather modification ought to be done in the open light of day fact is it's
[01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:42.840]  not militaries around the world continue to experiment in this area when you see
[01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:46.560]  storms like this or earthquake events like we've seen in the last few days I
[01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:51.440]  get a flood of calls and and people asking you know was it harp the fact is
[01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:55.120]  it could be hard it could be a number of other systems operating in the world
[01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:58.920]  there are a bunch of harp systems all over the place that they even admit right
[01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:03.120]  right this is exactly right and the Russians is where all this started going
[01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:07.760]  back to the 1970s with the woodpecker signal that many people remember and it
[01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:11.800]  was that irritating noise for ham operators and they triangulated it to
[01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:16.360]  these five transmitters in Russia and those were the first ionosphere
[01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:22.880]  keters the very first and in now over three four decades of advancement much
[01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:28.880]  higher better technology exists today but looking at this storm I mean we've had
[01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:32.160]  other meteorologists and people on and they say look it's all manipulated
[01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:34.800]  already because like you said they've already started manipulating all over
[01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:40.560]  the place and so it now it's not the natural weather anymore but obviously the
[01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:45.200]  sun is so powerful I want to specifically talk about we know about the
[01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:47.920]  cloud city we know about that technology we know about the Stanford
[01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:53.960]  Research Institute and Dr. Ben Livingston and others who by 67 it's now
[01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:57.720]  been declassified what six years ago could make hurricanes kill hurricanes
[01:23:57.720 --> 01:24:02.240]  steer hurricanes we can strengthen all of the above and that they done it in the
[01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:09.080]  60s with Atlantic you know hurricanes off the coast just like this one now
[01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:11.760]  after he came on the show a few times they got mad at him and kind of
[01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:15.080]  threatened him off the show but the point is that was on Fox News AP you
[01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:19.640]  name it so even the 60s they were already messing with Atlantic storms my issue
[01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:25.760]  is we know this stuff is out there but but but I've had the director of Heart
[01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:28.000]  Pond remember what five years ago we were able to get him on the show and he
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:31.520]  said hey I'm able to ignite the atmosphere and then a kernel came on
[01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:34.560]  during the break and ended the interview and I'm surprised that that
[01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:37.440]  interview didn't get more attention it was pretty big deal so now you're I mean
[01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:40.240]  because you know here's the kernel bossing the head of it around the
[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:44.480]  civilian head it was bragging about igniting the atmosphere with this stuff
[01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:49.800]  but but but past that past just ionizing things tell us what harp does and then
[01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:53.120]  from the patents this is stuff that you really popularized because you're
[01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:57.280]  scientific proof 20 years ago what's the really advanced stuff they've got
[01:24:57.280 --> 01:25:01.640]  because what harps 30 years old right you know in terms of the things that can
[01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:05.800]  be done fairly easily is a moving of a jet stream you know you think about that
[01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:10.000]  in terms of steering anything that's kind of the root of it harp can easily do
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:14.600]  this in fact any ionosphere heater in the world which is what they generally
[01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:18.320]  refer to these because they actually heat the ionosphere they lift it up now
[01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:25.360]  imagine a 30 mile diameter column moving up several hundred kilometers into
[01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:29.160]  space and then all the lower atmosphere moving in to fill that space so this
[01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:34.200]  alters pressure systems this alters can alter the flow of a jet stream around it
[01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:38.960]  when you start to look at just the simplest way and then you predict down
[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:44.800]  stream now years ago back in 2002 scientific America had a feature story
[01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:49.760]  on weather modification and weather generally but one of the things they
[01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:55.200]  show is the jet stream coming just above harp making a dog leg and then going
[01:25:55.200 --> 01:26:00.000]  back south well what it did is move a jet stream out of the Dallas area all the
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:04.960]  way over to Orlando Florida where it dropped a couple of tornadoes right in
[01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:07.840]  the middle of town and many might remember that event especially those
[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:14.400]  who live in that that region but this was a very simple application something
[01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:17.960]  you could do with with harp or any of these instruments around the world the
[01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:23.440]  the other thing was manipulating gravitational waves now that was a
[01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:28.760]  very last idea which means you use a lot less energy use a very long wavelength
[01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:33.280]  which you can generate by oscillating or manipulating the ionosphere which is
[01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:37.480]  this energized layer that begins about 30 miles above the Earth's surface
[01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:41.880]  extending out beyond that when you start to manipulate that you change it from
[01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:46.560]  DC to AC so it turns into this giant broadcast antenna in the sky now imagine
[01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:51.920]  you've just converted this huge energy potential both into a broadcasting
[01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:56.680]  system and you've amplified the signal that you set up so now you can bombard
[01:26:56.680 --> 01:27:01.640]  the earth you can manipulate on a very foundational level of gravity wave which
[01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:06.280]  then has reactions within the entire way in which you can manipulate you know
[01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:09.880]  moving up the chain whether or moving in a different direction and affecting
[01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:14.360]  fault lines pressure built up where earthquakes could occur and actually
[01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:18.240]  causing that energy to release at a very specific time and perhaps in a very
[01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:22.280]  specific place so pretty versatile instrument when you think about it but
[01:27:22.280 --> 01:27:27.440]  the root of it is electromagnetic energy the manipulation of energy across a
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:33.360]  very big bandwidth to modulate the signal and actually harmonize or
[01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:36.840]  resonate with whatever you're trying to affect so you can do quite a bit with
[01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:40.800]  harp a lot which is in the mainstream literature these days how does the
[01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:45.400]  aerosol spraying fit in because we know there are big secret programs they've
[01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:49.520]  that they've admitted programs and they admitted patents to have stuff added to
[01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:54.000]  jet fuel than aerosol izes and things but then a lot of the science I see says
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:58.880]  that it's actually the antennas are making regular ice crystals resonate
[01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:04.560]  differently and are forming larger trails so that's why we're seeing more
[01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:09.280]  condensation trails that aren't even really chemtrails it could be either
[01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:13.200]  either situation but here's what happens when you introduce a chemical element
[01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:18.160]  say into an environment that you subject a certain population to if you send a
[01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:23.800]  signal in and say that's a considered maybe toxic and really large quantities
[01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:28.600]  but not so toxic in these very small quantities once it's in the body or into
[01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:32.640]  tissue if you send a signal in that resonates or harmonizes at that same
[01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:37.200]  frequency you can trick the body into believing that it's gotten a massive load
[01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:41.120]  of that chemical and begin reacting accordingly with the same kinds of
[01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:45.840]  symptoms but when you do blood work and you check it just it's a mystery illness
[01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:49.480]  no one can take the doctor give that in layman's terms you're talking about a
[01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:54.200]  binary weapon system where one part is chemical but but but then being
[01:28:54.200 --> 01:29:00.120]  resonated with but it's untraceable right exactly right and so you end up with
[01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:07.120]  a very toxic effect or an ultrasonic effect for sure but anyone outside of
[01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:10.720]  that doesn't experience it then when you turn the signal off and people come
[01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:14.840]  into that area they get minimal levels of that toxin so it doesn't affect them at
[01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:19.240]  all incredible weapon incredible weapon yeah and it's you know when you think
[01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:23.800]  about it it's one of many technologies but they're all revolved around the same
[01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:27.640]  idea which is this oscillating electromagnetic fields and what you can
[01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:31.680]  do with them and pulsing them or you think about it like a hammer banging a
[01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:36.040]  nail the swing is the frequency but the pulse rate is every time it taps the
[01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:40.360]  head of that nail well you can set up a different kind of signal when you're
[01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:44.200]  doing this to the ionosphere this electromagnetic layer and you know we
[01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:47.160]  had done that video I tell you what stay there dr. nick baggages our guests

[01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:08.560]  you could accept the fact that the city is headed for a disaster of biblical
[01:33:08.560 --> 01:33:12.640]  proportion what do you mean biblical what do you mean this Old Testament yes
[01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:17.160]  mayor real wrath of God type stuff fire and brimstone coming down from the skies
[01:33:17.160 --> 01:33:21.080]  rivers and seas boiling 40 years of darkness earthquakes while canoes the
[01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:24.880]  dead rising from the grave human sacrifice dogs and cats living
[01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:28.160]  together
[01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:34.680]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of
[01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:42.080]  tyranny over the mind of man Thomas Jefferson live from Austin Texas
[01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:50.320]  broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones absolutely we've been fighting an uphill
[01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:53.520]  battle against the globalist being laughed at for saying there was a private
[01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:57.200]  banking cartel establishing world government with a eugenics based
[01:33:57.200 --> 01:34:01.760]  philosophy of scientific tyranny but now that information is becoming very
[01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:07.320]  mainstream the danger is it'll just become mainstream and accepted that we
[01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:12.000]  live under this tyranny or we can become mainstream and we can reject it
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:16.440]  there's seven plus billion of us humans have incredible power dr. Nick Baggidge
[01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:20.280]  multiple degrees I'm not going to get into it all prestigious family as well
[01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:25.680]  of great people is a late father of congressman who did a lot stood up
[01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:29.040]  against tyranny his brother serving in the Senate of the United States as well
[01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:32.880]  you can find out more about him at earth pulse.com we're all his books and
[01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:37.320]  videos are located we sell them all as well at info wars dot com info war
[01:34:37.320 --> 01:34:40.240]  store.com we're going to go back to him in a moment and we will get to some
[01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:43.680]  calls as well but what he's talking about here he's just giving you this
[01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:49.040]  shorthand need to understand something there are hundreds of patents he can
[01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:51.400]  just list to you in fact I'll get him to lift some off the top of his head you
[01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:54.640]  go look him up he says Alex you're worried about chemicals in the food
[01:34:54.640 --> 01:34:59.920]  water that's very primitive one level it's electromagnetic and then I went
[01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:04.760]  and did research on this folks whenever I go to UT psychology department and they
[01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:09.760]  let me in people we've got inside or whenever I get intel from MIT from
[01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:15.480]  scientist it's all about frequency pulses I mean you go by laboratory every
[01:35:15.480 --> 01:35:19.120]  laboratory with monkeys strapped down and and they're just in it in its TV
[01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:22.960]  shows but it's flashing lights so our kids have convulsions when they watch
[01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:27.720]  Pokemon that's on our new issue of info wars magazine they're literally
[01:35:27.720 --> 01:35:31.440]  lowering the brain waves lowering the consciousness they are literally putting
[01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:36.000]  people into trance states that's why they laugh at you and I mean they admit
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:40.360]  billions of dollars paid by Obama but that's just Obama and the government
[01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:44.840]  it's been going on for decades to put pro government-run health care messages
[01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:48.760]  and sitcoms and dramas that's one level of propaganda where they overtly in the
[01:35:48.760 --> 01:35:53.840]  sitcoms the dramas the cop shows their anti-gun anti-family you can argue well
[01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:56.360]  it and socialist health care good to give poor free health care but it's
[01:35:56.360 --> 01:36:01.040]  globalist health care it's bad people not even believe in socialism which I
[01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:05.240]  don't these are evil people that want to make you dependent so they can hurt you
[01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:11.920]  and my point is there's a war against consciousness and we lead the world in
[01:36:11.920 --> 01:36:16.720]  cancer we lead the world in diabetes in obesity in neurological disorders
[01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:20.600]  they're killing us and I have the White House science are right here that
[01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:24.480]  document cam guys eco science is on the table it's it's online it's been scanned
[01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:29.280]  online it's type in text of eco science John P. Holdren run over there and he
[01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:33.520]  says we're gonna put stuff in the water well guess what they are he wrote that
[01:36:33.520 --> 01:36:37.480]  back in 1970 he's now the White House science are you hear Ted Turner say get
[01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:43.480]  rid of 90% of people this is what they're doing and and and they're robbing us of
[01:36:43.480 --> 01:36:47.760]  our consciousness some of us just like a lot of insects end up being immune to
[01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:52.080]  poison a certain percentage are immune some people just get more angry but by
[01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:56.720]  this stuff I think I'm by the grace of God you know I am not fully immune to
[01:36:56.720 --> 01:37:00.560]  this but a lot of us were either immune like some people are immune to certain
[01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:05.400]  types of snake bites and things we're immune the general public is not okay
[01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:10.320]  and that they're hurt and bad a doctor I'm ranting here it's just that
[01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:14.000]  everything is about consciousness and go over what you're talking about here
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.920]  because because you're getting into government documents here and you know
[01:37:16.920 --> 01:37:20.080]  again it's all about give you a chemical or something and then they have a
[01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:25.200]  frequency that resonates I mean it's a perfect system and and this is what
[01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:28.440]  we're under I mean I read about the feds paying at police departments everywhere
[01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:33.240]  to put in super fast flashing fluorescent lights that that data
[01:37:33.240 --> 01:37:37.400]  transmit with the new computers and then I go look up the patent and it's based
[01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:42.160]  in a system for putting you into a trance I mean we if people think we're
[01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:46.360]  zombies now we ain't seen nothing yet they're just trying to get away with it
[01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:50.840]  engaging it and we're all in a giant laboratory I'm ranting here but correct
[01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:55.240]  me if I'm wrong you're you're exactly right in fact you can use any oscillator
[01:37:55.240 --> 01:38:00.320]  we did a book you guys carry it controlling the human mind and it was
[01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:05.480]  this discussion of again oscillating pulsing electromagnetic fields with or
[01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:09.600]  without chemicals it depends on what you want to do but you can manipulate the
[01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:14.080]  brain to a very high resolution and this is what some what's changed over time
[01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:18.760]  is the resolution think about it as what we're doing right now on a Skype you
[01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:22.600]  couldn't do that a few years ago but as we've refined and got tighter and tighter
[01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:27.000]  on our technology bandwidth we're able to utilize a lot much more efficient
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:31.200]  microprocessors are a thousand times smaller than 25 years ago that's the
[01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:35.840]  technology we know about right and it's much much much better than that but
[01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:41.600]  think about the brain as the ultimate technology the human brain in terms of
[01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:45.160]  being able to interact with it but at the same time the human potential which
[01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:49.560]  is being interfered with because part of the big research in all of this over
[01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:54.120]  the last 50 60 years the biggest revelation was how powerful the human
[01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:58.360]  mind is not just all the human minds together but every single individual
[01:38:58.360 --> 01:39:02.480]  human mind is more powerful than biggest computers in the world if we ever
[01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:07.200]  really stepped into our full potentials as created human beings it would be much
[01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:11.640]  much different scenario in fact the easiest way to keep that from happening
[01:39:11.640 --> 01:39:16.880]  is to keep the population in kind of a constant state of worry anxiety and fear
[01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:21.440]  and what happens is the brain itself can't reach these certain states of
[01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:24.760]  consciousness where your best intellectual work is done your most
[01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:28.960]  creative work is done well that's my greatest frustration is that when I'm
[01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:34.000]  out sitting under a tree by a natural creek or something with my children the
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:38.480]  whole universe opens up in the poetry the understanding and then I get on air
[01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:42.920]  with a frantic directing things and working and I lose like 90% of my mind
[01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:47.960]  but but everybody knows that happens and also people misinterpret doctor I want
[01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:52.480]  your take on this they think some of them that I'm up here trying to scare
[01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:57.120]  people it's the opposite I believe when people know how serious it is we'll take
[01:39:57.120 --> 01:40:01.520]  action it's the opposite of fear I am literally not even worried about him
[01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:05.120]  killing me or putting me in a dungeon because I want humanity to go to the
[01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:10.800]  next level I understand that it is societal cultural species death of
[01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:16.680]  consciousness if this enemy wins and the power is there it's so frustrating
[01:40:16.680 --> 01:40:20.400]  it's right in front of us you know every individual you know the American
[01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:25.320]  Revolution I think the statistics I read it started with a 6% popular idea you
[01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:28.360]  know when you translate into election season you know half the people that can
[01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:33.840]  register actually don't half the people that are registered don't vote and half
[01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:37.320]  the people that do vote make the decisions that's only 12 and a half
[01:40:37.320 --> 01:40:42.840]  percent of the population potentially of potential voters it's stirring it up
[01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:47.520]  where just a few don't make it makes a huge huge difference and vice versa
[01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:52.440]  stirring it up so everybody does show up makes it too and I think that's really
[01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:56.440]  important in at least local elections and national elections I think is kind of
[01:40:56.440 --> 01:41:00.520]  on the on the presidential scale anyway is you know which which piece of bad
[01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:05.520]  news do you want but laying that aside when you look at the manipulation of
[01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:08.880]  populations in the political season think about the television ads and all
[01:41:08.880 --> 01:41:13.560]  the media as it come at you they do a couple things one is what you alluded
[01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:18.480]  to before the flicker rate if you actually modulate a television set during
[01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:22.880]  commercial at a specific rate to put someone in a highly suggestive state
[01:41:22.880 --> 01:41:25.480]  and you're already kind of there you know when you think about people coming
[01:41:25.480 --> 01:41:29.280]  home stressed out after work if they have a job and then sitting in front of the
[01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:32.560]  television while their spouse is hollering at them trying to get their
[01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:35.720]  attention they don't even hear them because they're in a light trance state
[01:41:35.720 --> 01:41:40.120]  and then all you have to do is dial it up a little finer which television ad and
[01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:44.040]  if you look at the white wall behind you when you're watching a television show
[01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:48.280]  and look at the flicker rate it will cause you within 20 seconds to hit that
[01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:52.960]  trance like state where then they add just the regular ad becomes much more
[01:41:52.960 --> 01:41:57.200]  anchoring for the majority of the population not for everyone but the
[01:41:57.200 --> 01:42:01.640]  majority and the fact is you don't need very much in close elections to make the
[01:42:01.640 --> 01:42:05.680]  difference and I think that's again it's something unregulated every school of
[01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:09.640]  psychology teaches frequency following responses what we're talking about here
[01:42:09.640 --> 01:42:14.320]  and you can use any modulator you can use the internet radio television you
[01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:18.400]  can modulate a signal in the in the atmosphere using big systems like
[01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:24.040]  heart yes sir and cell phones towers and DARPA is even been in the Baltimore Sun
[01:42:24.040 --> 01:42:27.760]  admitting this 12 years ago I saw an article the patents are all there you've
[01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:31.720]  written books on it and here here's what's incredible Darren McBreen on a job
[01:42:31.720 --> 01:42:37.120]  many years ago happened to be out at a monkey farm and they had the apes all and
[01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:41.960]  the monkey strapped in with flickering you know a television I've been into the
[01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:47.600]  UT facility and the guy's like oh you're not supposed to see this you didn't see
[01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:51.800]  this and he punched up the monkey farm out at Bastrop with monkeys with wires
[01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:56.120]  in their heads and all this stuff and I was like whoa and then I was led into
[01:42:56.120 --> 01:42:59.760]  other areas how to flicker and make women sexually excited that was a whole
[01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:03.440]  laboratory I mean the colleges aren't even for the young people that you know
[01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:06.800]  they're often other buildings that's all you I mean you're a professor you're
[01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:12.080]  you know that I mean it's a total front now and and I'm telling you they are
[01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:16.960]  spending almost all their time just on flicker rates testing different things I
[01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:20.680]  mean it's incredible well there's a lot of contracts that have been led in the
[01:43:20.680 --> 01:43:24.500]  area of the mind and in fact there was a couple on electronic telepathy and I
[01:43:24.500 --> 01:43:28.500]  think we talked about them a few years ago to the University of California where
[01:43:28.500 --> 01:43:32.360]  they were looking at the brain in real time and then trying to replicate the
[01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:36.240]  signal that they see as complex as that is and then send it into another brain
[01:43:36.240 --> 01:43:40.120]  to see if the you know the same thought could be generated this kind of
[01:43:40.120 --> 01:43:45.000]  technology is is out there it's been advancing light flicker rates for
[01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:48.280]  manipulating behavior is well known there's a couple great patents on this
[01:43:48.280 --> 01:43:55.320]  by Munro and when you look at the whole history of the study of the mind it's
[01:43:55.320 --> 01:43:58.800]  become the most exciting thing in a lot of places I mean in terms of what it
[01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:03.200]  offers because the same technologies are you that are being used to suppress our
[01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:06.760]  potentials are also those technologies that help us understand what our
[01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:10.160]  potentials are exactly and the transhumanist that came out of the
[01:44:10.160 --> 01:44:14.960]  eugenicist again I'm not saying in all transhumanism would be bad if someone
[01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:19.840]  chose you know just just you know for sight or whatever it is but the eugenicist
[01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:23.640]  claim they want to empower humanity at the top but I've read the books they
[01:44:23.640 --> 01:44:26.320]  put out I don't know you have they have these elite conferences with a
[01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:30.280]  billionaire show up close to the public but then it leaks there at these
[01:44:30.280 --> 01:44:35.640]  meetings as Bill Joy wrote in 2000 in the April issue of Wired deciding how
[01:44:35.640 --> 01:44:39.080]  they're gonna just get rid of us that they're gonna transcend and not give us
[01:44:39.080 --> 01:44:43.760]  any of this it is and then they're the worst people they're the of course they
[01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:47.800]  want to hoard it all they're never gonna get all this year they're not gonna do
[01:44:47.800 --> 01:44:52.080]  this to us and then have God allow them to have all that I mean you reap what
[01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:56.000]  you so the universe is bigger than them and their computers and everything and
[01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:59.840]  I think you know they need to be honest about this and we need to have a real
[01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:03.880]  debate about the future of the species instead of them dumbing everybody down
[01:45:03.880 --> 01:45:07.640]  because right there they're not immune from what they're doing everything
[01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:11.000]  they're doing to us is coming back on them how does the elite deal with this
[01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:14.320]  because I know you've run in some pretty high-level circles you know it's
[01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:18.240]  interesting because everyone has a deep philosophy that I've ever met in high
[01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:22.000]  position and if you figure out that you really get their motivation and a lot of
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:27.400]  them quite frankly are in my view at least motivated by the wrong things and
[01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:32.720]  self-interest becomes the governing issue and a lack of understanding of the
[01:45:32.720 --> 01:45:37.240]  broader picture if you will it is about game you know the other guy losing and
[01:45:37.240 --> 01:45:41.400]  someone winning and what I observe all over the world is the same things are
[01:45:41.400 --> 01:45:47.320]  being sold here as it been sold say in Russia the retirement programs in Russia
[01:45:47.320 --> 01:45:52.360]  the risk of their social security system you know they have privatized social
[01:45:52.360 --> 01:45:58.400]  security too but all the things they are doing there in Europe we're doing here in
[01:45:58.400 --> 01:46:03.760]  the US it's like it is a global plan I mean the politics is becoming a cross
[01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:08.280]  cultural where it applies all the way across and we think we're in a private
[01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:11.480]  debate we think we're in a national debate but we're not we're in an
[01:46:11.480 --> 01:46:15.040]  international bait on all levels whether we see it or not and most of us
[01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:19.560]  don't travel 50 miles from our home but those of us that do see the same
[01:46:19.560 --> 01:46:25.200]  parallels popping up in banking in finance in regulation the way we live
[01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:29.600]  and the freedoms that we have or don't have anymore the fact is it is globalist
[01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:35.280]  taking it away from us in a in an incredible in an incredible way and
[01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:39.120]  again they know how to dominate and win the game but point is they're destroying
[01:46:39.120 --> 01:46:44.480]  their own species in the process and that's the thing it's like you've got
[01:46:44.480 --> 01:46:48.000]  to be individualistic they say come into the communal to take away your
[01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:53.160]  individualism no no no you're an individual but you make decisions of how
[01:46:53.160 --> 01:46:56.480]  you want to be treated that's how you treat others because when everybody has
[01:46:56.480 --> 01:47:03.400]  that attitude civilizations rise when you have the the civilization of pee in
[01:47:03.400 --> 01:47:06.280]  the pool because I want to well everybody starts doing it and the pool
[01:47:06.280 --> 01:47:10.080]  becomes toxic I mean it really comes down to that that the globalists are
[01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:14.480]  almost like idiots of aunts they're idiots when it comes to love in the
[01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:18.280]  larger universe but they're they're savants when it comes to technocratic
[01:47:18.280 --> 01:47:23.080]  evil and the will to power you know you can go back to as a big new
[01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:26.680]  brzezinski's writings on this you know one of the former's of the Trilateral Commission
[01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:31.880]  national security advisor to Jimmy Carter and and I quote from him often the you
[01:47:31.880 --> 01:47:36.240]  know between two ages was a book about technologies and how technology was
[01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:40.440]  shaped the world geopolitically it was written in the 70s early 70s and if you
[01:47:40.440 --> 01:47:44.960]  read it you swear it's a history because it's exactly that way in other words
[01:47:44.960 --> 01:47:49.360]  whether he was forecasting a right in the roadmap and I think a lot of others do
[01:47:49.360 --> 01:47:53.320]  he wrote the roadmap my dad was at UT in the 60s and they already had a lot of
[01:47:53.320 --> 01:47:56.680]  the technology that came out 20 years later and they were all telling them
[01:47:56.680 --> 01:48:00.840]  everything that was going to happen I mean I mean listen we're on a plan they
[01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:04.800]  knew what the web was going to do DARPA create they've got the whole that it's
[01:48:04.800 --> 01:48:09.440]  all 50 year and 100 year plans as brzezinski writes yeah and the you know
[01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:13.360]  the World Wide Web but PBS did a piece on this they called it the the next
[01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:17.480]  generation of this the World Wide Mind which is the idea of connecting every
[01:48:17.480 --> 01:48:22.640]  mind together in some artificial way that I I find pretty objectionable and I
[01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:27.200]  think most people would but the fact that people are taking that science to
[01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:31.080]  that direction without regulation without consideration of what human beings
[01:48:31.080 --> 01:48:37.200]  are fundamentally I think is a huge error the other part of this is if we do if a
[01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:43.080]  very few reach their full potential as humans everything changes the existing
[01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:47.320]  order changes when it becomes truly transparent it falls apart because when
[01:48:47.320 --> 01:48:51.720]  you really look into what governments have done in the level of corruption not
[01:48:51.720 --> 01:48:57.400]  just over you know in some third world backwater but right here we've done it
[01:48:57.400 --> 01:49:02.240]  with regulation and the niceties of law but the result is the same power just
[01:49:02.240 --> 01:49:07.360]  dictates what happens in this country if you have money you determine access to
[01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:11.440]  legislators influence on those legislators and outcomes from those
[01:49:11.440 --> 01:49:16.040]  legislators because if you walk into your US senator's office and you ask for
[01:49:16.040 --> 01:49:20.480]  30 minutes of time likelihood of getting it about zero but if you write a check
[01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:23.440]  for five grand for their campaign committee and walk in and ask for that
[01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:26.040]  half hour I guarantee you're gonna figure out they're gonna figure out the
[01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:31.880]  time but the problem is that money money to interest special interests decide
[01:49:31.880 --> 01:49:37.120]  everything anymore unless the politician specifically stays grounded with the
[01:49:37.120 --> 01:49:44.720]  people that elected them it always drifts this way you know my brother mark at
[01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:48.960]  one time in his political career early on he said don't trust any of them and
[01:49:48.960 --> 01:49:52.960]  you won't be disappointed and that's a family been involved in this for 50
[01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:58.960]  years and I can tell you hold everyone's feet to the fire no matter who they are
[01:49:58.960 --> 01:50:03.120]  because the very system they entered begins to corrupt from the first day the
[01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:06.920]  best advice I can give to anyone in public office who's new to the game is
[01:50:06.920 --> 01:50:11.120]  stay true to yourself stay in touch with your constituents reach out to the
[01:50:11.120 --> 01:50:14.520]  people that elected you because otherwise you lose your heart and your soul to
[01:50:14.520 --> 01:50:19.240]  a game that is just cold-hearted well sure and and you know powerful men
[01:50:19.240 --> 01:50:23.400]  always get us into huge wars that a lot of times even destroy them because it's
[01:50:23.400 --> 01:50:27.360]  about one-upping and the very dominant instinct that got them where they are
[01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:30.640]  they don't know when to pull back they don't know when to stop and I'm
[01:50:30.640 --> 01:50:34.680]  speaking directly to the evil ones out there I can historically know where
[01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:39.680]  this is going and the the technocrats aren't gonna make it out of this either
[01:50:39.680 --> 01:50:44.480]  and and and they that they've made a lot of mistakes too but because they're in
[01:50:44.480 --> 01:50:48.600]  charge they're able to just keep going and doubling down and I just say pull
[01:50:48.600 --> 01:50:53.400]  back stop don't do it no because it's gonna end all this it's gonna end your
[01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:57.800]  grandkids it's gonna end their kids it's going to be the death of us if we
[01:50:57.800 --> 01:51:00.560]  don't turn this around under Nick Beckins is our guest I'm Alex Jones

[01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:14.320]  future for two hours to go over all the other emerging technologies and things
[01:55:14.320 --> 01:55:19.560]  that are going on I mean in closing if you go back 25 years ago the
[01:55:19.560 --> 01:55:22.360]  establishment didn't let DU get used because they knew it would kill the
[01:55:22.360 --> 01:55:27.720]  trips not just the enemy you know 20 30 years ago they cared more about
[01:55:27.720 --> 01:55:33.040]  radioactive accidents everything it just seems like the establishment doesn't
[01:55:33.040 --> 01:55:38.840]  care about anything anymore I mean are they drinking their own Kool-Aid or do
[01:55:38.840 --> 01:55:43.040]  you have a comment on this phenomenon I see of more and more recklessness I just
[01:55:43.040 --> 01:55:46.400]  think that's that's the best descriptor it is recklessness it's a lack of
[01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:51.000]  awareness a lack of consciousness you know slow down people out there listen
[01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:55.600]  to the information don't get afraid but get empowered start stepping into it
[01:55:55.600 --> 01:55:59.400]  calm the mind and use your mind again that's how this stuff changes and it's
[01:55:59.400 --> 01:56:03.720]  changes one person at a time do what you can in the neighborhood you're in is
[01:56:03.720 --> 01:56:07.680]  what I say what you can what you know you can do a try and accomplish that
[01:56:07.680 --> 01:56:12.520]  everyone has a sphere of influence exercise it in the best way the most
[01:56:12.520 --> 01:56:16.320]  conscious way you can not out of fear but out of confidence in knowing that
[01:56:16.320 --> 01:56:20.000]  you're making change Alex I always appreciate being on with you because I
[01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:25.320]  know it's about making change we're it's tired of you know all of us in so many
[01:56:25.320 --> 01:56:30.960]  ways economics isn't just trickle down economics it's trickle down society and
[01:56:30.960 --> 01:56:35.960]  culture and opportunity that's happened and it's an elite that wants to stay
[01:56:35.960 --> 01:56:40.200]  that way and maintain that position at the expense of everyone else there's in
[01:56:40.200 --> 01:56:45.360]  my observation in the world is there's plenty of resources we can all do very
[01:56:45.360 --> 01:56:51.640]  very well the planet is much bigger we're and scratching the surface so we
[01:56:51.640 --> 01:56:56.880]  need to be good stewards make it happen in a different way vote early I mean is
[01:56:56.880 --> 01:57:01.720]  this disaster may be passing as people are suffering with the cleanup but
[01:57:01.720 --> 01:57:05.760]  anything can happen between now and election day vote at least in local
[01:57:05.760 --> 01:57:09.040]  elections where it might make a difference at the presidential level
[01:57:09.040 --> 01:57:14.720]  Godspeed maybe we'll see a change there maybe the fire will burn hot enough where
[01:57:14.720 --> 01:57:19.240]  someone will make some better decisions well that's the issue is even if people
[01:57:19.240 --> 01:57:23.600]  are corrupt they've got a lot of their kids and I mean it is it is really
[01:57:23.600 --> 01:57:29.360]  insane what the establishment the GMO all of it that's coming out and you know
[01:57:29.360 --> 01:57:34.200]  really it's this when good men do nothing evil men triumph as the founders
[01:57:34.200 --> 01:57:38.840]  said and we always let the worst person in the room who wants the power
[01:57:38.840 --> 01:57:42.880]  dominate and run everything it's time for people that that want a civilization
[01:57:42.880 --> 01:57:45.920]  to go you know what I'm standing up against you and I don't care how this
[01:57:45.920 --> 01:57:50.080]  ends you got to go through me before you get to do this and if we just start
[01:57:50.080 --> 01:57:54.840]  being a little harder you know to corral things are going to get better I mean
[01:57:54.840 --> 01:57:58.840]  it's that simple that you're being yes man is going to destroy us that's
[01:57:58.840 --> 01:58:02.260]  exactly right I mean it's stepping into the power of that we are what we're
[01:58:02.260 --> 01:58:06.840]  created to be I believe we're created in the image of a creator that's not weak
[01:58:06.840 --> 01:58:11.040]  people that's very powerful people exercise your free will in the way that
[01:58:11.040 --> 01:58:15.800]  changes the world that's all we can do and I'm a pathological optimist I say
[01:58:15.800 --> 01:58:20.400]  because I'm not gonna give up and I know you aren't either Alex and maybe we'll
[01:58:20.400 --> 01:58:23.520]  see this thing turn around I mean sometimes big disaster brings about
[01:58:23.520 --> 01:58:28.820]  unawakening that no one can stop I agree we've got to admit how bad it is to
[01:58:28.820 --> 01:58:33.040]  rise the occasion and turn it around the sleeping giant that is the humanity
[01:58:33.040 --> 01:58:36.880]  needs to awaken Dr. Nick baggage we salute you thank you so much thanks for

[02:00:46.400 --> 02:00:49.680]  got Bob Fletcher amazing individual coming up we'll take more calls this
[02:00:49.680 --> 02:00:53.920]  hour I'm sorry I haven't gotten to a bunch of them yet Alicia in New York side
[02:00:53.920 --> 02:00:57.960]  of some of the worst flooding and disaster and deaths Alicia thank you
[02:00:57.960 --> 02:01:03.240]  for holding good to have you here with us I give a suretake on the storm hi
[02:01:03.240 --> 02:01:10.040]  Alex I think I think it depends on where you are definitely like where the other
[02:01:10.040 --> 02:01:14.240]  caller was from in the Rockleys and call me islands there definitely was a lot of
[02:01:14.240 --> 02:01:19.800]  damage and flooding I know lower Manhattan definitely flooded and the
[02:01:19.800 --> 02:01:24.480]  water receded but you know the stock exchange is closed the past few days
[02:01:24.480 --> 02:01:29.080]  World Financial Center closed the Wall Street Center construction site was
[02:01:29.080 --> 02:01:34.840]  flooded a bit you know I personally live there was no power outage but I've
[02:01:34.840 --> 02:01:40.960]  been in contact with people out in Jersey and other parts of the plane where
[02:01:40.960 --> 02:01:47.920]  there were like transformers exploding and fires and power outages so it
[02:01:47.920 --> 02:01:54.680]  definitely depends on where you are so do you think the media is overhyped it or
[02:01:54.680 --> 02:02:00.520]  do you think underhyped it what's your take I think I think a little bit of
[02:02:00.520 --> 02:02:05.720]  overhyped and I think that that has a bad effect because then New Yorkers tend
[02:02:05.720 --> 02:02:10.160]  to always want to just sort of like brushing off their shoulders and say oh
[02:02:10.160 --> 02:02:14.960]  you know this is fine it wasn't so bad and I think after Irene people still
[02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:18.720]  didn't prepare much but there was a lot of scrambling this time around and I
[02:02:18.720 --> 02:02:22.920]  think for those I think probably both the majority of people were okay and
[02:02:22.920 --> 02:02:25.920]  there's no probably not gonna prepare and then you know there'll be another
[02:02:25.920 --> 02:02:32.960]  event and people will be scrambling again so I think overall probably was a bit
[02:02:32.960 --> 02:02:37.920]  of hype and a lot of people will look at it that way yeah I agree with you that's
[02:02:37.920 --> 02:02:41.480]  the problem with the continued hyping of disasters then when it really happens
[02:02:41.480 --> 02:02:45.520]  people aren't ready because the system has been been crying wolves I mean I've
[02:02:45.520 --> 02:02:49.080]  been like saying oh this is nothing and then it is kind of bad well pretty bad
[02:02:49.080 --> 02:02:53.280]  not as bad as they said it'd be I mean it's just hard to gauge all this stuff
[02:02:53.280 --> 02:02:56.640]  and instead we're being killed by the incremental loss of liberty and freedom
[02:02:56.640 --> 02:03:00.440]  and everything thank you so much Alicia and stay in contact with us Otter in
[02:03:00.440 --> 02:03:04.080]  Massachusetts Otter thanks for holding now what's on your mind about the storm
[02:03:04.080 --> 02:03:09.200]  how you're doing today good sir good to hear from you all right and you thank you
[02:03:09.200 --> 02:03:16.200]  um that's as far as the storm goes not first I very incredible I'm hoping you'll
[02:03:16.200 --> 02:03:21.720]  bring back dr. Nick again soon this great amazing there so I think one of
[02:03:21.720 --> 02:03:25.200]  things people are missing on the storm is that we've got this combination of
[02:03:25.200 --> 02:03:32.680]  full moon and high tides which the title surge is then brought on shore and
[02:03:32.680 --> 02:03:35.400]  that's what the flooding is coming from a lot of people that aren't getting the
[02:03:35.400 --> 02:03:42.520]  news out there and people like myself out here Cape Cod and the islands we
[02:03:42.520 --> 02:03:48.400]  didn't get a ton of rain registered 50 to 65 mile an hour winds today they're
[02:03:48.400 --> 02:03:54.360]  saying they did hit 95 you know there were some trees down but it was nothing
[02:03:54.360 --> 02:04:00.400]  like the instances of Bob or the perfect storm and sure so the good news is
[02:04:00.400 --> 02:04:04.160]  gotten on shore flooding still a problem the winds are slowing down it's
[02:04:04.160 --> 02:04:09.760]  losing power hopefully the single Peter out right losing power that's one of the
[02:04:09.760 --> 02:04:12.920]  key elements and that brings us around the two things I'd love to hit on I
[02:04:12.920 --> 02:04:16.760]  don't know if I can get both today ahead but transhumanism is one of them the
[02:04:16.760 --> 02:04:20.640]  real thing is the continuation of the storm thought and that is that the
[02:04:20.640 --> 02:04:26.920]  electric issues are still cycling we just got internet back at this house my
[02:04:26.920 --> 02:04:32.240]  host house here it had gone out I got one post in to plan info wars last night
[02:04:32.240 --> 02:04:37.120]  before it just everything went down the power has been the same way coming going
[02:04:37.120 --> 02:04:41.000]  coming going but that's from trees going down and it's also from the types of
[02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:44.800]  feeds that we get especially out here on this island seven miles up in the
[02:04:44.800 --> 02:04:50.760]  Atlantic so that aspect aside transhumanism is gonna happen is I'll
[02:04:50.760 --> 02:04:54.240]  get Bob Fletcher on but if you can hold longer if we've introduced Bob and stuff
[02:04:54.240 --> 02:04:57.760]  we'll start taking some calls while Bob's on he can comment on everything
[02:04:57.760 --> 02:05:02.440]  he's a really interesting fella stay with us Aaron full in here as the food
[02:05:02.440 --> 02:05:06.480]  police shut down food co-ops the Amish and small farmers Americans are losing
[02:05:06.480 --> 02:05:10.400]  access not just a raw milk and homemade cheeses but to healthy home crafted
[02:05:10.400 --> 02:05:13.960]  sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut yogurt and kefir it seems
[02:05:13.960 --> 02:05:17.800]  there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria but
[02:05:17.800 --> 02:05:20.880]  frankly I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid of these remarkable
[02:05:20.880 --> 02:05:24.000]  foods have been around since the beginning of history with archaeological
[02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.880]  evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across the globe
[02:05:26.880 --> 02:05:31.240]  in almost every culture even today Japanese eat miso Africans eat fermented
[02:05:31.240 --> 02:05:35.520]  porges Koreans eat kamichi and in India fermented milk is a staple for healthy
[02:05:35.520 --> 02:05:39.000]  living but here's some good news self-reliant Americans can now discover
[02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:42.480]  the secrets to making these amazing fermented foods legally and privately in

[02:08:47.920 --> 02:08:59.800]  enough Jesse Ventura broke this news here yesterday new national anti TSA
[02:08:59.800 --> 02:09:04.960]  campaign opt out in film week that articles up there and then under that
[02:09:04.960 --> 02:09:11.280]  Time Warner kills TV show critical of TSA now this they were just told this three
[02:09:11.280 --> 02:09:15.720]  days ago I learned I talked to Ventura last Friday for about 30 minutes about a
[02:09:15.720 --> 02:09:19.360]  bunch of issues off air and then I set him up for Monday and then he just
[02:09:19.360 --> 02:09:26.640]  learned it Friday after I talked to him because I consulted in all three seasons
[02:09:26.640 --> 02:09:32.640]  and was in of course a lot of the episodes they took the TV show away they
[02:09:32.640 --> 02:09:35.520]  normally air them about a month after they're done they aired them about 11
[02:09:35.520 --> 02:09:39.240]  months after they're done this is her airing November 7th and they killed the
[02:09:39.240 --> 02:09:43.680]  TSA episode that was like the first two seasons really hardcore issues they
[02:09:43.680 --> 02:09:48.320]  cover a lot more out there stuff this series that's the only reason you know
[02:09:48.320 --> 02:09:51.840]  Time Warner allowed to come out but they ended up still getting credible info
[02:09:51.840 --> 02:09:56.680]  in there saying this is real this isn't and so they took it away and they
[02:09:56.680 --> 02:10:02.080]  re-edited it and then they said by the way we're not gonna air the 8th episode
[02:10:02.080 --> 02:10:06.360]  the big TSA finale which had top scientists about it causing cancer the
[02:10:06.360 --> 02:10:12.360]  cancer clusters with the TSA people the public the admissions the shirt off
[02:10:12.360 --> 02:10:16.040]  making money off of it I mean this is something that's important and just like
[02:10:16.040 --> 02:10:20.200]  Amber Lyon three-time Emmy Award winner at CNN they were covering up
[02:10:20.200 --> 02:10:25.880]  massacres by their allies in Qatar in other areas and Al Qaeda being run by our
[02:10:25.880 --> 02:10:29.800]  government and they basically forced her out she means she quit because they
[02:10:29.800 --> 02:10:33.000]  wouldn't let her get her reports on it she found out foreign governments were
[02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:43.800]  paying millions to CNN to control production she we had Facebook yesterday
[02:10:44.120 --> 02:10:49.520]  one of our big accounts with 320 something thousand people on it that's
[02:10:49.520 --> 02:10:53.720]  subscribed to it daily and they said you're not allowed to say bin Laden CIA we
[02:10:53.720 --> 02:10:57.760]  have their notice we have a copy of it it's in the article Facebook now since
[02:10:57.760 --> 02:11:00.760]  during political post this hate speech it's now off the front page it's in our
[02:11:00.760 --> 02:11:05.080]  Twitter thing a real Alex Jones that folks don't just think you're gonna keep
[02:11:05.080 --> 02:11:09.160]  getting all this they're spending now over 20 billion a year was like 10
[02:11:09.160 --> 02:11:13.480]  billion before for anti-gun anti-family pro-socialism messages that's
[02:11:13.480 --> 02:11:18.320]  admitted now used to it was classified that the sitcoms the dramas it's all
[02:11:18.320 --> 02:11:24.480]  anti-family anti-liberty anti-freedom that's why all the shows dramas cop
[02:11:24.480 --> 02:11:29.840]  shows sitcoms all of it it's all getting money and what's the message
[02:11:29.840 --> 02:11:34.080]  anti-freedom anti-family anti-sovereignty that were criminals if we
[02:11:34.080 --> 02:11:38.560]  don't want to vaccinate this is propaganda most people don't even get
[02:11:38.560 --> 02:11:43.400]  news from a newspaper or TV news 23% do that get it from newspapers the rest is
[02:11:43.400 --> 02:11:47.720]  watching television being bombarded and and there's like five shows out now
[02:11:47.720 --> 02:11:51.040]  where gun owners are terrorists and have to get rounded up and put in camps and
[02:11:51.040 --> 02:11:55.440]  people that like the founding fathers are terrorists and and and one of the
[02:11:55.440 --> 02:11:59.120]  British stars one of the shows said people it was in the daily mail two
[02:11:59.120 --> 02:12:02.800]  weeks ago see him from the national TV show I forget the name of it because I
[02:12:02.800 --> 02:12:05.720]  don't watch all that idiocy I just read the boil downs and they come up go
[02:12:05.720 --> 02:12:09.080]  you're the terrorists we're gonna beat you up he plays a right-wing American
[02:12:09.080 --> 02:12:14.200]  gun owner people believe that folks they think a lot of them driving along now
[02:12:14.200 --> 02:12:18.200]  go that's one of the terrorists there's no real patriot terrorist but you know
[02:12:18.200 --> 02:12:20.880]  the feds occasionally blows something up and blame it on us like Oklahoma City
[02:12:20.880 --> 02:12:24.800]  but my point is and Bob Fletcher's exposed that is don't just think you're
[02:12:24.800 --> 02:12:29.800]  always going to hear this or see this it is a uphill battle victory that we're
[02:12:29.800 --> 02:12:34.760]  on over a hundred AM and FM affiliates in global shortwave and XM radio and you
[02:12:34.760 --> 02:12:41.040]  know one of the top rated news websites in the world it's because the globalists
[02:12:41.040 --> 02:12:44.320]  don't have full control yet they want their global government they want full
[02:12:44.320 --> 02:12:47.280]  control they're still pockets of talk radio there's still things like drudge
[02:12:47.280 --> 02:12:52.320]  report.com and info wars.com a world that daily that they don't control okay
[02:12:52.320 --> 02:12:56.920]  and and the fact is people get threatened over covering this people get
[02:12:56.920 --> 02:13:00.320]  all sorts of stuff I won't even get into because I won't advertise fear for the
[02:13:00.320 --> 02:13:04.200]  enemy when we get attacked we know we're over the target that's the old saying
[02:13:04.200 --> 02:13:07.280]  from World War two you know you're over the target when you get the heavy any
[02:13:07.280 --> 02:13:14.840]  aircraft flak but you've got to understand that you better appreciate right
[02:13:14.840 --> 02:13:17.760]  now that there's still some freedom on the web that there's still some freedom
[02:13:17.760 --> 02:13:21.480]  on talk radio if you hear us on a local AM and FM station folks you better
[02:13:21.480 --> 02:13:26.480]  appreciate that station manager owner program director you better appreciate
[02:13:26.480 --> 02:13:29.880]  the sponsors on that station yeah we get ratings and that's one reason we're
[02:13:29.880 --> 02:13:33.600]  finally breaking through and getting on a lot more stations but it's still people
[02:13:33.600 --> 02:13:38.360]  bucking the system to put us on let me tell you something folks I mean it is a
[02:13:38.360 --> 02:13:41.960]  miracle we're still on the air and reaching this many people and it is a
[02:13:41.960 --> 02:13:45.080]  testament that there's people awake out there and it's a testament people like
[02:13:45.080 --> 02:13:50.600]  Ron Paul Bob Fletcher G. Edward Griffin Bob Chapman countless others over the
[02:13:50.600 --> 02:13:55.480]  last 50 years in some cases Red Beckman the list goes on and on Aaron Russo
[02:13:55.480 --> 02:14:01.080]  that have been fighting the globalist if they got ridiculed attacked let me tell
[02:14:01.080 --> 02:14:04.480]  you something 30 years ago folks they plant pipe bombs on your property if
[02:14:04.480 --> 02:14:08.520]  you talked about the New World Order they'd arrest people they kill people that
[02:14:08.520 --> 02:14:13.760]  wrote newsletters about the JFK murder people used to get thrown in prison and
[02:14:13.760 --> 02:14:17.080]  tortured for speaking about this because the globalists didn't have full control
[02:14:17.080 --> 02:14:20.080]  then they're like we got to keep this down but they didn't stop it because the
[02:14:20.080 --> 02:14:23.560]  Patriots were willing to die so that we would have a foundation of what was
[02:14:23.560 --> 02:14:27.040]  happening and now they've been proven right Bob Fletcher's been attacked he's
[02:14:27.040 --> 02:14:30.160]  been I mean we want to have time to tell that whole story today told on a
[02:14:30.160 --> 02:14:33.680]  previous episode but let me tell you I've been physically attacked I've had so
[02:14:33.680 --> 02:14:37.440]  many dirty tricks you wouldn't believe it death threats on my family in SA
[02:14:37.440 --> 02:14:40.120]  calling up and telling my wife they're listening to her what she just said to
[02:14:40.120 --> 02:14:43.720]  her parents same thing to me my crew has seen me on the phone when this is
[02:14:43.720 --> 02:14:50.040]  happening this is real okay the New World Order is real the cancer viruses in
[02:14:50.040 --> 02:14:53.440]  the vaccines are real the aluminum dioxide getting sprayed on you's real
[02:14:53.440 --> 02:14:58.440]  this is real this is real this is real this is real this isn't entertainment
[02:14:58.440 --> 02:15:03.760]  it in a joke okay you behind the scenes around here this isn't a game around
[02:15:03.760 --> 02:15:07.200]  here you understand that there's a little gallows humor around here but
[02:15:07.200 --> 02:15:10.960]  that's about it this is real I'm gonna shut up go to Bob Fletcher his take on
[02:15:10.960 --> 02:15:15.720]  the hurricane the rest of it but Bob of course Bob Fletcher investigations.com
[02:15:15.720 --> 02:15:19.080]  is a businessman investigator film producer speaker and author he had a
[02:15:19.080 --> 02:15:24.080]  multi-million dollar big company toy company the CIA took it over use it as a
[02:15:24.080 --> 02:15:27.800]  front he didn't even know understand it that's how it all started and then 20
[02:15:27.800 --> 02:15:31.160]  years ago it goes down the rabbit hole from there after years of business
[02:15:31.160 --> 02:15:35.160]  professional career Bob became involved in US government top-secret cover and
[02:15:35.160 --> 02:15:40.920]  arms sales without even knowing it and a simple business merger Bob merged his
[02:15:40.920 --> 02:15:44.280]  toy manufacturing company with a company that imported watches that company was
[02:15:44.280 --> 02:15:48.680]  called Vista USA Inc. was a covered operation front and generals would come
[02:15:48.680 --> 02:15:52.640]  in you name it for US arms sales and covert mercenary training eventually the
[02:15:52.640 --> 02:15:55.880]  owner Gary Best attempted to recruit Fletcher into the business of arms
[02:15:55.880 --> 02:15:59.320]  sales and Fletcher refused to become involved later Bob came a witness in the
[02:15:59.320 --> 02:16:02.840]  Iran Contra mess testified to Congress folks and he then became an
[02:16:02.840 --> 02:16:07.400]  investigative assistant with several houses Senate investigators since then
[02:16:07.400 --> 02:16:11.200]  Bob has been chasing bad guys in the government and producing some of the
[02:16:11.200 --> 02:16:15.760]  world's best exposays Bob reports are viewable all over the world Bob Fletcher
[02:16:15.760 --> 02:16:19.200]  investigations and he also got hit with a microwave gun that almost killed him
[02:16:19.200 --> 02:16:22.200]  but we won't get into all that Bob we're going to break here in a few minutes
[02:16:22.200 --> 02:16:27.160]  you just heard my rant but the point is it's big news in Greece that they're
[02:16:27.160 --> 02:16:30.800]  kicking people journalists off newspapers and off the web that are
[02:16:30.800 --> 02:16:34.640]  exposing police corruption and killings that's one in Guardian here they're
[02:16:34.640 --> 02:16:38.440]  starting to shut more and more stuff down YouTube shut and stuff down we're
[02:16:38.440 --> 02:16:43.320]  seeing marked increases government funding of media is increasing and it's
[02:16:43.320 --> 02:16:48.400]  not even a news issue because the kleptocratic press the prostitutes as
[02:16:48.400 --> 02:16:53.240]  Gerald Solente calls them they are loving it because they can't survive up
[02:16:53.240 --> 02:16:57.000]  against us so they want us to be shut down do you have any comments on the
[02:16:57.000 --> 02:17:00.960]  fact that people better make hay while the sun's shining because the sun is
[02:17:00.960 --> 02:17:05.240]  shedding absolutely everything that you've been you call it your rant
[02:17:05.240 --> 02:17:10.240]  and you're you're right on with the rant that's for sure yeah people don't
[02:17:10.240 --> 02:17:17.520]  realize they really do have to appreciate what little time we have left in
[02:17:17.520 --> 02:17:24.080]  terms of when I say we the the patriotic seriously concerned Americans
[02:17:24.080 --> 02:17:30.680]  because they they started out like you say 30 years ago when I was involved
[02:17:30.680 --> 02:17:35.640]  directly with what they called the militia movement and in fact they jumped
[02:17:35.640 --> 02:17:39.640]  on board with that only because of the terminology was something that would
[02:17:39.640 --> 02:17:45.640]  shock the bad guys up in Washington to use that word militia you know it
[02:17:45.640 --> 02:17:49.640]  could have been a you know it's called the cells informational center or
[02:17:49.640 --> 02:17:54.040]  something like that which is primarily what we were but we utilize the word
[02:17:54.040 --> 02:17:58.880]  militia and shook the shook up the bad guy we are the resistance where we're
[02:17:58.880 --> 02:18:04.880]  what's left of freedom it's in and and and the closing of the door on the
[02:18:04.880 --> 02:18:10.840]  ability for any of us to go anyplace to be able to have a good talk radio show
[02:18:10.840 --> 02:18:14.960]  where you can come out and say the things that these guys don't want us to
[02:18:14.960 --> 02:18:21.320]  say it the door is closing and you're absolutely right they can run wild once
[02:18:21.320 --> 02:18:24.600]  everything's shut down and they're geared up for it they just haven't taken
[02:18:24.600 --> 02:18:31.160]  the full plunge yet and they want to well and plus that the the the ability for
[02:18:31.160 --> 02:18:38.640]  for I'm calling just the bad guys the ability for for them to paint us as as
[02:18:38.640 --> 02:18:44.560]  crazy as lunatics as as well as a big deal when the militia movement got
[02:18:44.560 --> 02:18:49.960]  moving so many years ago you know what people have to recall at that point in
[02:18:49.960 --> 02:18:55.720]  time there was no computer websites set up you know we couldn't just jump on a
[02:18:55.720 --> 02:19:00.680]  website that didn't exist and we have to actually have the fax people back and
[02:19:00.680 --> 02:19:07.520]  forth or use the telephone or the talk radio shows and they very easily came
[02:19:07.520 --> 02:19:13.800]  on board the bad guys and instantly just said these people are crazy and and you
[02:19:13.800 --> 02:19:18.640]  know that we were the we were complete lunatics and the truth was everybody
[02:19:18.640 --> 02:19:24.760]  with the exception of some small group of maybe 8% or 10% which is the same
[02:19:24.760 --> 02:19:30.480]  percentage of let's say wackos that we have in the general public out there we
[02:19:30.480 --> 02:19:34.600]  did have some of those in got involved with us obviously and because that's the
[02:19:34.600 --> 02:19:40.560]  nature of human beings we did have some but there were no criminals there was no
[02:19:40.560 --> 02:19:47.280]  terrorists involved they labeled me a terrorist I was a toy manufacturer they
[02:19:47.280 --> 02:19:52.760]  basically to use his blunt term I got screwed by a corrupted government stay

[02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:20.560]  biological androids going back to Bob Fletcher Bob you know I learned about
[02:25:20.560 --> 02:25:26.960]  Nick baggage probably in about 94 but I remember watching access television in
[02:25:26.960 --> 02:25:32.600]  high school when I was a senior in 1992 here in Austin Texas and seeing people
[02:25:32.600 --> 02:25:35.680]  that were getting your news reports and passing them through the underground
[02:25:35.680 --> 02:25:40.000]  resistance network where you were you know talking about weather modification
[02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:43.480]  and government sponsored terror and then you were talking about Waco after that
[02:25:43.480 --> 02:25:47.680]  happened a few years later and then Oklahoma City and you know at that
[02:25:47.680 --> 02:25:51.360]  underground news broadcaster of people getting the VHS tape she would do every
[02:25:51.360 --> 02:25:54.280]  month getting them out and reach millions because people care to go down to
[02:25:54.280 --> 02:25:58.320]  access an errand and then that helped with the knowledge already had super
[02:25:58.320 --> 02:26:03.280]  charged me to the point yourself and many others to to do what we're doing
[02:26:03.280 --> 02:26:07.960]  today so people don't think as you hand out a copy of the magazine that we sell
[02:26:07.960 --> 02:26:13.200]  at cost at info or store.com as a modern pampleteer you give somebody a
[02:26:13.200 --> 02:26:16.760]  subscription get the police department a subscription 12 of them mailed to their
[02:26:16.760 --> 02:26:20.800]  door we have extras only the last issue to the first time we send it out to get
[02:26:20.800 --> 02:26:25.560]  13 issues talk about a way to wake somebody up or copies of videos or DVDs
[02:26:25.560 --> 02:26:29.160]  that's the danger of the cloud but then a few years there won't be anything
[02:26:29.160 --> 02:26:32.200]  physical then they can just erase it they've already done that off Kindle
[02:26:32.200 --> 02:26:35.480]  where they've erased a bunch of books and it was protest they went back up but
[02:26:35.480 --> 02:26:42.160]  I'm ranting here Bob getting into the the hurricane we've had some meteorologists
[02:26:42.160 --> 02:26:45.280]  and folks on saying it looks like it was manipulated your take on that
[02:26:45.280 --> 02:26:50.920]  well first of it and people people still now when I started this and of course
[02:26:50.920 --> 02:26:56.880]  the big deal was when I when I I took a deep swallow sitting in front of the
[02:26:56.880 --> 02:27:02.280]  Senate Intelligence subcommittee being asked about a multitude of things of
[02:27:02.280 --> 02:27:06.920]  course they were trying to make us the militia there was five of us I had set
[02:27:06.920 --> 02:27:12.440]  that up with our inspector and which later on he told me he he was sorry
[02:27:12.440 --> 02:27:17.880]  that he had done it but they and I say sorry because they were unable to
[02:27:17.880 --> 02:27:21.240]  accomplish what they wanted to do and that was to make us all look like a
[02:27:21.240 --> 02:27:26.160]  bunch of idiots but when I sat in front of the Intelligence Committee I took a
[02:27:26.160 --> 02:27:32.960]  big swallow answering the question that was put before me and that was it was a
[02:27:32.960 --> 02:27:38.560]  senator Cole from Wisconsin and he said in the Associated Press interview with
[02:27:38.560 --> 02:27:45.120]  you Mr. Fletcher you said that the United States had the capability to
[02:27:45.120 --> 02:27:51.400]  modify and control the weather and use it as a weapon and of course the point
[02:27:51.400 --> 02:27:56.200]  there was everybody was supposed to laugh at me and of course I just simply
[02:27:56.200 --> 02:28:00.800]  said and I was the first person that came out I'm gonna say out in in the
[02:28:00.800 --> 02:28:05.120]  general public you know because everybody of course covered those hearings at
[02:28:05.120 --> 02:28:10.840]  that time and I said you know yes sir as we have all the documentation on it
[02:28:10.840 --> 02:28:16.480]  and and and etc etc so we went on from there but the my point is that to this
[02:28:16.480 --> 02:28:25.040]  day 95% of the American people number one either does do not know about the
[02:28:25.040 --> 02:28:30.800]  potential that we do have weather control manipulating abilities and they
[02:28:30.800 --> 02:28:35.480]  they they wouldn't believe it I mean they're still you know so they have that
[02:28:35.480 --> 02:28:41.920]  big mask of the national news broadcast over their face so they don't
[02:28:41.920 --> 02:28:47.000]  understand they still wouldn't believe it to this day and this is at today this
[02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:52.920]  is old stuff they really have a down pat compared to what they were doing back in
[02:28:52.920 --> 02:28:57.160]  the 90s obviously and they've been working on it and putting tons of money
[02:28:57.160 --> 02:29:03.760]  into it but not only that now we have our own I'm gonna see the bad guys with a
[02:29:03.760 --> 02:29:10.600]  capability of affecting the weather obviously here in the United States and
[02:29:10.600 --> 02:29:15.760]  and now electronically it's fairly it's fairly easy to even understand but I
[02:29:15.760 --> 02:29:22.800]  won't get into that today but the problem is we also have the Russians and
[02:29:22.800 --> 02:29:27.440]  red China the Russians a long time ago got into oh and they're all over the
[02:29:27.440 --> 02:29:31.040]  news admitting it but here they just say it doesn't exist but then Bill Gates
[02:29:31.040 --> 02:29:34.760]  comes out and says he runs it but it still doesn't exist stay there long
[02:29:34.760 --> 02:29:39.520]  segment coming up and phone calls Bob Fletcher with us just an amazing

[02:33:41.680 --> 02:33:43.960]  taking some calls here because I know people have been holding a lot of you
[02:33:43.960 --> 02:33:48.360]  there in the storm ravaged areas Kenny and I want to have Otter finish up as you
[02:33:48.360 --> 02:33:52.320]  got cut short you want to talk about transhumanism but Bob Fletcher let me ask
[02:33:52.320 --> 02:33:56.120]  you this looking at this storm from what you know you were starting to get into
[02:33:56.120 --> 02:34:00.680]  Russia and China who admit they would modify their weather when Russia had
[02:34:00.680 --> 02:34:05.840]  those big storms and fires people in their doom came out and said the US and
[02:34:05.840 --> 02:34:11.000]  NATO are using weather weapons on us and in harp systems well they should know
[02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:13.960]  they've got them too and you've been in this congressional reports you were
[02:34:13.960 --> 02:34:20.160]  congressional advisor but then I have yuppies occasionally you know walk by
[02:34:20.160 --> 02:34:24.600]  and say are the black helicopters gonna get me and I just go just Google
[02:34:24.600 --> 02:34:27.920]  military drill they have black helicopter drills to acclimate you going on
[02:34:27.920 --> 02:34:33.360]  every city oh sure cookie and and and and it's just like oh I bet a world
[02:34:33.360 --> 02:34:36.720]  government's gonna get me too even as world governments being announced I
[02:34:36.720 --> 02:34:41.960]  mean don't we have a leg up though at least I found that now because no
[02:34:41.960 --> 02:34:45.040]  matter how much they make fun of us or have the ADL say we're terrorists or
[02:34:45.040 --> 02:34:47.960]  Southern Prairie Law Center say we're evil of you say there's a new world
[02:34:47.960 --> 02:34:52.440]  order well the governments are announcing a new world order I can play MSNBC
[02:34:52.440 --> 02:34:57.720]  or CNBC or CNN announcing world government and saying isn't it good
[02:34:57.720 --> 02:35:01.080]  we're gonna have a dictatorial world government run by six banks who are
[02:35:01.080 --> 02:35:04.440]  unaccountable I'm just saying isn't it good to be thrown into a woodchipper
[02:35:04.440 --> 02:35:08.320]  isn't it good to jump out of an airplane without a parachute I mean it's so other
[02:35:08.320 --> 02:35:13.680]  worldly until you realize the propaganda is aimed at people in arrested
[02:35:13.680 --> 02:35:18.200]  development dream states so so so comment on the the Russia thing you were
[02:35:18.200 --> 02:35:22.400]  getting into and then overall where you think the elite are trying to tag us well
[02:35:22.400 --> 02:35:29.760]  you know the problem is that the mindset they the bad guys have been
[02:35:29.760 --> 02:35:34.720]  controlling the media so totally profusely I mean for years and years and
[02:35:34.720 --> 02:35:38.840]  of course it's getting a tighter and tighter grip and the electronic media of
[02:35:38.840 --> 02:35:43.720]  course it's fantastic for them well I want everybody to realize something you
[02:35:43.720 --> 02:35:50.320]  know for every one good bit of honest sincere information you get from
[02:35:50.320 --> 02:35:54.640]  patriots like Alex or myself or any of the rest of us that are out here trying
[02:35:54.640 --> 02:36:02.120]  to wake you up to put it out in front of you as it was put out in front of us by
[02:36:02.120 --> 02:36:08.320]  someone else in my case actually by the bad guys themselves but the point is
[02:36:08.320 --> 02:36:14.960]  that they've they've so tremendously successfully dumbed me down the people
[02:36:14.960 --> 02:36:21.120]  that that it really is difficult to judge where we are at this point in time
[02:36:21.120 --> 02:36:26.720]  first off now and coming up very soon they're simply gonna pass sufficient
[02:36:26.720 --> 02:36:30.760]  legislation which I actually they already have it but they're gonna be able
[02:36:30.760 --> 02:36:36.440]  to just throw the switch off on us just punch off the electronics they admit
[02:36:36.440 --> 02:36:39.200]  they've already got the internet kill switch they just want to have cybersecurity
[02:36:39.200 --> 02:36:43.040]  passed to have it in law they admit they'll disappear us they admit they
[02:36:43.040 --> 02:36:47.000]  torture kids in front of their parents I mean I mean it's like admitting their
[02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:52.320]  Nosferatu wait the only thing that there this is a guess the only thing they're
[02:36:52.320 --> 02:37:00.920]  waiting for is to to have a reason a synthetic reason that they can get the
[02:37:00.920 --> 02:37:05.840]  bulk of the American people to believe that it is a good thing that they're
[02:37:05.840 --> 02:37:11.960]  gonna pull the plug on on the the media that you and I put out once they can
[02:37:11.960 --> 02:37:16.200]  come up with whatever scam it's gonna be you know it's like they did with the
[02:37:16.200 --> 02:37:19.600]  old militia movement everything where they kept burning fish shooting people
[02:37:19.600 --> 02:37:23.480]  blowing up buildings like in Oklahoma and all of that and pointing the finger
[02:37:23.480 --> 02:37:30.400]  at us on those events you know the reality being that everybody has to
[02:37:30.400 --> 02:37:35.280]  remember nobody from the militia movement was ever charged with any of this
[02:37:35.280 --> 02:37:40.960]  stuff it was just innuendo but it works so well they sent people out and took
[02:37:40.960 --> 02:37:45.600]  photographs of license plates and that kind of stuff to where nobody wanted to
[02:37:45.600 --> 02:37:48.720]  come out any longer it's pure intimidation so we give into the
[02:37:48.720 --> 02:37:52.000]  intimidation they win and here's an example that we're gonna get more into
[02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:54.760]  the weather weapons and then a few calls here for patient folks that are
[02:37:54.760 --> 02:37:59.400]  sitting there a month and a half ago I'm driving to work there is a eight-rotor
[02:37:59.400 --> 02:38:04.680]  drone flying down the highway at 300 feet I pull over get video of it find
[02:38:04.680 --> 02:38:09.440]  the operator for the highway department got it on video Rob do's sister is
[02:38:09.440 --> 02:38:13.800]  hiking on the hiking bike trail a drone with flashing police lights flies over
[02:38:13.800 --> 02:38:18.880]  she follows it and finds the cops operating it spying on people but for
[02:38:18.880 --> 02:38:22.240]  some reason was intimidated and didn't video tape it with her cell phone okay
[02:38:22.240 --> 02:38:26.560]  but by the way anybody catches this stuff on tape you send it to us we we we
[02:38:26.560 --> 02:38:29.640]  break it and it's good footage I'll pay you 500 bucks I mean I want to show
[02:38:29.640 --> 02:38:33.040]  people these things in action guess what I saw driving to work yesterday and
[02:38:33.040 --> 02:38:36.280]  almost had an automobile accident trying to get it on tape and I wasn't gonna
[02:38:36.280 --> 02:38:41.960]  talk about it because I couldn't get it on tape yeah guess what I saw it looked
[02:38:41.960 --> 02:38:47.120]  like a global Hawk white drone but he had a jet engine it looked like wasn't a
[02:38:47.120 --> 02:38:51.160]  predator with a propeller it was at about three to four thousand feet I was
[02:38:51.160 --> 02:38:56.800]  coming down 360 capital Texas highway up to get on Ben White 290 and I start
[02:38:56.800 --> 02:39:00.600]  seeing as I'm going up the hill and then I get up in the mixed master and by the
[02:39:00.600 --> 02:39:05.120]  time I confirm what it is it's almost above me so I'm up in the truck with the
[02:39:05.120 --> 02:39:09.040]  camera like this trying to get shots cars are almost hitting me I go I got to
[02:39:09.040 --> 02:39:13.240]  have this I pull over there's no place to pull over I let cars go around me I
[02:39:13.240 --> 02:39:16.920]  pull over I see no cars are coming by the grace of God at 9 30 in the morning
[02:39:16.920 --> 02:39:22.160]  except we're about 500 yards back I try to get out and just didn't have time it
[02:39:22.160 --> 02:39:25.960]  almost got run over I shouldn't even be admitting I did this the point is it was
[02:39:25.960 --> 02:39:31.000]  going very slow my dad was a pilot I flew a lot I know I mean it was I mean I
[02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:34.800]  system would stall it to I mean I'm not really assessing to like 50 of the winds
[02:39:34.800 --> 02:39:39.840]  into it it was not not going but a hundred miles an hour okay max it was
[02:39:39.840 --> 02:39:48.400]  almost like stalling and I was like is that a is that a global Hawk balloon or
[02:39:48.400 --> 02:39:51.760]  something because it looked like a global Hawk but it was barely moving and
[02:39:51.760 --> 02:39:54.440]  then I didn't I try to turn around the highway but by then it was already over
[02:39:54.440 --> 02:39:57.920]  the hills and gone I mean that's how crazy this is getting and we know they've
[02:39:57.920 --> 02:40:04.880]  used predators where the other big thing now of course it's is that a local
[02:40:04.880 --> 02:40:12.360]  police all over in every major city within 90 days are gonna start you're
[02:40:12.360 --> 02:40:19.760]  gonna start seeing the same types of not not just observation units you know
[02:40:19.760 --> 02:40:24.240]  taking pictures and spying on people because they are now putting them
[02:40:24.240 --> 02:40:31.920]  into the police forces you will be seeing them but also armed and and how
[02:40:31.920 --> 02:40:35.880]  they you know exactly you know the same as the the drones that that we're
[02:40:35.880 --> 02:40:41.800]  operating out of Los Angeles California and killing the people over in the
[02:40:41.800 --> 02:40:45.560]  mid-east you know but yeah but I mean I mean they're using them in North
[02:40:45.560 --> 02:40:50.640]  Dakota to arrest ranchers I mean that's going on my point is if I'm seeing
[02:40:50.640 --> 02:40:54.440]  drones every month and a half I mean I mean I've got a global Hawk up on
[02:40:54.440 --> 02:40:58.200]  screen for Prison Planet TV viewers but anybody can Google global Hawk I mean
[02:40:58.200 --> 02:41:04.880]  it was a global Hawk and and I know or some type of other variant and I'm just
[02:41:04.880 --> 02:41:08.880]  wondering what is a global Hawk doing over Austin well as you know it came
[02:41:08.880 --> 02:41:12.560]  out a few months ago all over the country they've got them training targeting
[02:41:12.560 --> 02:41:16.720]  people's cars and stuff as training for other countries remember when the B2
[02:41:16.720 --> 02:41:21.520]  dropped a bomb on somebody's house a few years ago a dummy drill bomb and the
[02:41:21.520 --> 02:41:25.720]  point is there they're training for war against us well there's no question
[02:41:25.720 --> 02:41:29.360]  about that and they've been doing it for a long time they call it call it what
[02:41:29.360 --> 02:41:34.560]  you want and they they train we brought in other you know troops in going back
[02:41:34.560 --> 02:41:39.040]  many many years we bring troops in from other parts of the world and they
[02:41:39.040 --> 02:41:43.960]  utilize that as a good cover you know but the bottom line is absolutely down
[02:41:43.960 --> 02:41:48.640]  when you know when they built the entire little communities for training and
[02:41:48.640 --> 02:41:52.440]  all that because you do that you did some great exposés on that yourself
[02:41:52.440 --> 02:41:58.640]  many years ago again this is back when they said we were really crazy but the
[02:41:58.640 --> 02:42:02.960]  big problem is to get the American public to realize that this is happening
[02:42:02.960 --> 02:42:09.360]  today and it's happening on you against you and this is now they're
[02:42:09.360 --> 02:42:13.920]  admitting it and the public still won't admit it I don't I was about to say
[02:42:13.920 --> 02:42:17.600]  this to you that's what it is back when you were exposing urban warfare drills
[02:42:17.600 --> 02:42:22.000]  practicing for the US I had emergency managers on police chief of San Antonio
[02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:26.240]  they brought a thing of cash in to buy him off not just for the great stuff that
[02:42:26.240 --> 02:42:31.480]  report was great and it was like pulling teeth back then to get people to pull
[02:42:31.480 --> 02:42:36.000]  exactly back then the statesman wrote an article saying I was crazy but that it
[02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:40.000]  was happening and that's what they do today now they say if you don't like the
[02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:43.680]  Marines doing a gun confiscation drill in your town and even really pulling
[02:42:43.680 --> 02:42:48.000]  real people over now it's your cooks because you don't like it before they
[02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:51.360]  have the drill and say it didn't exist even though it was on the I mean it's
[02:42:51.360 --> 02:42:57.120]  kids it's mind control and apparently it's really been working well I didn't
[02:42:57.120 --> 02:43:01.320]  think that we would ever reach a point to where somebody could paint a building
[02:43:01.320 --> 02:43:05.800]  black and tell you that it's white and everybody would think it was white it's
[02:43:05.800 --> 02:43:11.400]  amazing it is absolutely amazing and up here as a matter of fact in Idaho several
[02:43:11.400 --> 02:43:15.360]  years ago three four years ago maybe it's even five or six now at this point
[02:43:15.360 --> 02:43:21.800]  in time myself in a small group filed a lawsuit to stop the expansion and the
[02:43:21.800 --> 02:43:30.320]  utilization of a wildlife preserve as a military and police shooting range they
[02:43:30.320 --> 02:43:33.880]  wanted to actually use and move it up to where they could bring in as many as
[02:43:33.880 --> 02:43:38.960]  400 shooters at a time I was about to say that that's been confirmed they use
[02:43:38.960 --> 02:43:42.840]  these training centers private and government as the first cover and then
[02:43:42.840 --> 02:43:46.720]  they use that as a cover story just like your toy company as a black-op command
[02:43:46.720 --> 02:43:51.680]  base absolutely and in this case as of just a couple of weeks ago this has been
[02:43:51.680 --> 02:43:55.960]  going on for four or five years we had a great lawyer jumped in on it helped us
[02:43:55.960 --> 02:44:01.800]  out and and it's going to be it's gone already to the Supreme Court of or the
[02:44:01.800 --> 02:44:06.160]  Superior Court whichever it is here for the state of Idaho so you know we
[02:44:06.160 --> 02:44:13.920]  successfully shut down the state in utilizing a state animal preserve as a
[02:44:13.920 --> 02:44:16.780]  good good now let's give gears bravefully finishing up about Russia and
[02:44:16.780 --> 02:44:19.560]  China with their weather weapons because you got cut off last break I want to go
[02:44:19.560 --> 02:44:27.200]  calls okay yeah fine well basically the bottom line is the our own bad guys can
[02:44:27.200 --> 02:44:33.120]  carry out these these weather manipulations on us to reach the goal
[02:44:33.120 --> 02:44:39.040]  of the New World Order the drought who knows what that drought is going on the
[02:44:39.040 --> 02:44:42.720]  middle of the United States it's just gonna wipe out that I mean we're already
[02:44:42.720 --> 02:44:48.600]  at a point zero in terms of production there with the drought this storm that's
[02:44:48.600 --> 02:44:53.920]  taking place today I watching yesterday I was watching and they said how
[02:44:53.920 --> 02:45:00.320]  extraordinarily bizarre it was that we have quote-unquote the warm weather warm
[02:45:00.320 --> 02:45:08.240]  water toward hurricane structure coming into and mixing with a northeaster which
[02:45:08.240 --> 02:45:12.920]  of course is blizzards and snow and freezing weather and how bizarre it is
[02:45:12.920 --> 02:45:19.120]  and it what really rang the bell in my mind was that I had discovered many many
[02:45:19.120 --> 02:45:24.680]  years ago that the the basics of the weather control control and manipulation
[02:45:24.680 --> 02:45:31.760]  is warm by heating the water and heating the ionosphere in a given area
[02:45:31.760 --> 02:45:38.040]  triangulation heating that would constitute the the warm air rising that
[02:45:38.040 --> 02:45:44.360]  they need to direct and control and expand a hurricane type structure and
[02:45:44.360 --> 02:45:49.480]  that was exactly the words that they used yesterday at the experts say how
[02:45:49.480 --> 02:45:54.080]  bizarre it was that here we had this tropical thing coming up in the New
[02:45:54.080 --> 02:45:58.920]  Jersey with all the tropical water temperatures and everything maintaining
[02:45:58.920 --> 02:46:05.720]  this thousand mile storm and coming in emerging with the with the snow and ice
[02:46:05.720 --> 02:46:11.280]  I don't know obviously that's another problem we have it's like almost
[02:46:11.280 --> 02:46:18.240]  impossible to ever find out a given day and a given operation for these weather
[02:46:18.240 --> 02:46:23.680]  operations you know whether it's us or if it's the Russians or it's the Chinese
[02:46:23.680 --> 02:46:30.400]  it's almost impossible and if we ever get somebody it's one of the guys in there
[02:46:30.400 --> 02:46:34.920]  that actually throws the switches for this stuff the poor guy is going to be
[02:46:34.920 --> 02:46:40.480]  blown up before he gets to a microphone to be able to tell us about that info
[02:46:40.480 --> 02:46:46.520]  wars.com this just broke this is from washingtonpost.com it's not even
[02:46:46.520 --> 02:46:51.840]  hidden Melissa Melton has got an article detailing a United States
[02:46:51.840 --> 02:46:57.240]  Department of Commerce National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and
[02:46:57.240 --> 02:47:01.960]  Melissa Melton's got an article breaking us down hidden in plain view from
[02:47:01.960 --> 02:47:10.160]  back in 2008 the washington post covered at no nine. Hamp not harp, Hamp, H-A-M-P
[02:47:10.160 --> 02:47:15.400]  Homeland Security's research project on hurricane modification and there they go
[02:47:15.400 --> 02:47:19.360]  breaking down how they can manipulate hurricanes I mean the point is you know
[02:47:19.360 --> 02:47:22.480]  we're pointing out hey they can do this and their signs they're doing it and
[02:47:22.480 --> 02:47:26.240]  then we're just supposed to all just go along you know with the fact that it
[02:47:26.240 --> 02:47:29.720]  doesn't exist it's like. We're supposed to think that it's a good deal or
[02:47:29.720 --> 02:47:34.080]  something I don't understand it it's it's really mind-boggling you know one of
[02:47:34.080 --> 02:47:38.440]  if we get well a minute or two here just point something out that was a big
[02:47:38.440 --> 02:47:45.240]  milestone for myself in investigating this stuff back in 82 there was a
[02:47:45.240 --> 02:47:51.680]  fellow named Lowell Ponte this guy was actually a pentagon researcher for
[02:47:51.680 --> 02:47:57.240]  weather and he was involved with the weather war and weather warfare concepts
[02:47:57.240 --> 02:48:04.600]  in 82 and at that time he actually did an entire press release a story where he
[02:48:04.600 --> 02:48:10.320]  said that they could create earthquakes they had the of course this later on
[02:48:10.320 --> 02:48:15.040]  came out and a lot of other. Well Secretary DeVest Cohen in 1997
[02:48:15.040 --> 02:48:22.400]  and April April 18 I think I was in 1998 of Army Times gave a press briefing and
[02:48:22.400 --> 02:48:26.480]  said earthquake weapons seismic weapons we've got it all weather weapons. Right
[02:48:26.480 --> 02:48:30.920]  and again this fellow Ponte who was working directly for the Pentagon I'm
[02:48:30.920 --> 02:48:36.040]  sure he's deceased at this point in time but he did the whole thing and he said
[02:48:36.040 --> 02:48:44.040]  hey we've got the laser capabilities to punch a hole in the ionosphere we can
[02:48:44.040 --> 02:48:48.880]  actually create and manipulate the jet stream we can alter the direction of
[02:48:48.880 --> 02:48:53.320]  stores we can create them and create earthquakes as well and this was
[02:48:53.320 --> 02:49:02.880]  published back in 1982 in July of 82 in standard press and media and just to
[02:49:02.880 --> 02:49:06.800]  expand on that that's like saying we can jump out in oncoming traffic you know
[02:49:06.800 --> 02:49:10.560]  we can blow the whole earth up let's do it and these people are just all
[02:49:10.560 --> 02:49:14.800]  competing with each other to see you can have the most power it's like you know
[02:49:14.800 --> 02:49:18.400]  how many you know if it's out of a hot dog eating contest it's like a live
[02:49:18.400 --> 02:49:23.040]  hand-grenading contest or something. Well and I must be really good to what's
[02:49:23.040 --> 02:49:27.560]  going on right today with the with the storm with the sandy this gigantic
[02:49:27.560 --> 02:49:32.240]  it's an unbelievable storm I mean I was looking at the because I've done an
[02:49:32.240 --> 02:49:35.760]  awful lot of research I almost fall into the the category of being a
[02:49:35.760 --> 02:49:40.760]  scientific specialist in this. Oh it covers like 30-40% of the country now.
[02:49:40.760 --> 02:49:46.920]  Well it was a thousand miles yesterday from west to east to west
[02:49:46.920 --> 02:49:51.920]  west to east the whole thing was a thousand mile storm holy miracle all
[02:49:51.920 --> 02:49:58.120]  right but to get back to what it does in terms of politics we refer to the
[02:49:58.120 --> 02:50:05.600]  October surprise I think it's very difficult to analyze what manner by
[02:50:05.600 --> 02:50:12.800]  which somebody could come ahead on this except President Obama it would appear
[02:50:12.800 --> 02:50:20.040]  that by number one it cut down Romney's ability to go any place to expand his
[02:50:20.040 --> 02:50:24.840]  platform at all and number two. Let's Obama look presidential and dominate the
[02:50:24.840 --> 02:50:29.040]  news cycle. That's right. Let me show this from the Washington Post here it's at
[02:50:29.040 --> 02:50:36.000]  infowars.com. United States Department of Commerce DHS control of
[02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:40.400]  hurricanes by the Department of Homeland Security July 29 2009 a giant
[02:50:40.400 --> 02:50:47.560]  program funded hurricane aerosol and micro physics program. Oh but oh but we
[02:50:47.560 --> 02:50:52.040]  shouldn't think that they would do this Bob when it's a freak storm huh? Unbelievable.
[02:50:52.040 --> 02:50:59.840]  Department of Commerce DHS Obama ordered hurricane control. He's probably got a
[02:50:59.840 --> 02:51:05.480]  joystick running the thing. HempUSA.org brings you pure camo berry powder this

[02:51:33.120 --> 02:51:36.760]  stock workers investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs? They've been
[02:51:36.760 --> 02:51:40.880]  available since 1986 yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of
[02:51:40.880 --> 02:51:44.640]  gold for your retirement. Gold is outperform paper investments yet no
[02:51:44.640 --> 02:51:48.240]  word about IRAs. If you would like to have gold for your retirement call
[02:51:48.240 --> 02:51:53.880]  800-686-2237 don't get left behind by rising inflation in low returns call

[02:52:02.760 --> 02:52:05.840]  morning only to find your family shivering in the dark because you couldn't
[02:52:05.840 --> 02:52:10.120]  afford to pay your electric bill. That's closer than you think. You probably
[02:52:10.120 --> 02:52:13.240]  hadn't heard about this yet because the liberal media has been suppressing what
[02:52:13.240 --> 02:52:19.000]  has fast become in the most shocking news story of 2012. Obama's secret war on
[02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:23.240]  coal that could increase your already high power bill as much as 400% in
[02:52:23.240 --> 02:52:27.720]  coming months. As shocking as it sounds it may well be just a matter of time
[02:52:27.720 --> 02:52:31.800]  before the lights start going out across America. But here's some good news.
[02:52:31.800 --> 02:52:37.240]  There's an underground video at exposed123.com that thousands of smart
[02:52:37.240 --> 02:52:41.880]  patriots have used to end their slavery to the corrupt electricity monopoly. The
[02:52:41.880 --> 02:52:46.600]  video at exposed123.com has already been banned by Google and the liberal
[02:52:46.600 --> 02:52:50.240]  media is doing everything in its power to take it down and keep America in the
[02:52:50.240 --> 02:52:56.000]  dark. So watch it now at exposed123.com before it's too late. Again that's
[02:52:56.000 --> 02:53:00.120]  exposed123.com.
[02:53:00.960 --> 02:53:05.040]  That's what it sounds like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house
[02:53:05.040 --> 02:53:09.360]  that looks like no one is home. Don't let your home be the next target. Make it
[02:53:09.360 --> 02:53:13.440]  look like someone is home watching television with fake TV. Fake TV is a
[02:53:13.440 --> 02:53:17.520]  small electronic device that makes the same light as a real television. So from
[02:53:17.520 --> 02:53:21.600]  outside it looks like someone is home watching TV. Fake TV plugs in just like
[02:53:21.600 --> 02:53:25.880]  a lamp on a timer but is far more convincing to burglars. Fake TV deters
[02:53:25.880 --> 02:53:30.040]  burglars, costs far less than an alarm and is highly recommended by numerous
[02:53:30.040 --> 02:53:34.640]  police departments. Use it anytime you're away from home. To order your fake TV for
[02:53:34.640 --> 02:53:42.600]  only $34.95, go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV. Each additional fake TV
[02:53:42.600 --> 02:53:48.200]  is only $29.95. So get one for you and one for a loved one or safety, security and
[02:53:48.200 --> 02:53:55.280]  peace of mind for both of you. Call 877-5-F-A-K-E-T-V or go to faketv.com
[02:53:55.280 --> 02:54:00.360]  faketv.com the burglar deterrent.
[02:54:00.360 --> 02:54:16.360]  No one knows what it's like to be the bad man. To be the sad man. Behind blue eyes.
[02:54:16.360 --> 02:54:30.320]  No one knows what it's like to be hated. To be faded. To telling only lies.
[02:54:30.320 --> 02:54:43.800]  But my dreams, they aren't as empty as my conscience seems to be.
[02:54:43.800 --> 02:54:47.320]  Let's take some phone calls for Bob Fletcher.
[02:54:48.320 --> 02:54:54.400]  Otter and then Kenny. Otter and Mass, you had a point on transhumanism. We'll get
[02:54:54.400 --> 02:55:00.400]  Bob Fletcher's take on that. Go ahead, Otter. Okay. Thank you, Bob, for being
[02:55:00.400 --> 02:55:06.080]  there. The last couple of points you made were really dead on the money, saying
[02:55:06.080 --> 02:55:10.600]  things that don't often get out work frequently in this system of data
[02:55:10.600 --> 02:55:13.920]  compression. And that's one of the problems, I think, with getting this
[02:55:13.920 --> 02:55:19.360]  message out is the lexicon. People don't know it. They're so busy learning
[02:55:19.360 --> 02:55:24.800]  computeries and texties and forgetting American English that they can't
[02:55:24.800 --> 02:55:29.000]  communicate anymore. And they get turned off really rapidly. Now, a lot of this,
[02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:32.080]  obviously, we know is due to all these different dumbing down phases of the
[02:55:32.080 --> 02:55:35.280]  man. I always want to get Haliburton in there because... Sure, we're on this out of
[02:55:35.280 --> 02:55:40.160]  time. What was your point on transhumanism? Well, it can't come to
[02:55:40.160 --> 02:55:43.920]  be because there's no way that they can encapsulate a soul in a physical
[02:55:43.920 --> 02:55:47.520]  entity. Anything that's created on this plane, I don't care. What they can do
[02:55:47.520 --> 02:55:51.680]  with downloading memories, etc., storing them, they'll never come to pass
[02:55:51.680 --> 02:55:56.400]  because this human soul cannot be encapsulated. All right. Thank you,
[02:55:56.400 --> 02:56:00.320]  I want to get Bob's take on that. This just went up at infowars.com. It's at
[02:56:00.320 --> 02:56:06.120]  twitter.com.com. For real, Alex Jones. Cops, taser, 10-year-old boy, were refusing to
[02:56:06.120 --> 02:56:11.840]  clean patrol car. And now they taser people that don't answer questions or
[02:56:11.840 --> 02:56:16.560]  taser people that don't give urine samples, chained down to hospital beds. I mean,
[02:56:16.560 --> 02:56:22.240]  this is just torture, Bob Fletcher. Sure. As long as they're able to, excuse me, as
[02:56:22.240 --> 02:56:26.000]  long as they're able to get away with that, which they can, they seem to get away
[02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:31.280]  with it. The police at every level just carrying on outrageous acts on American
[02:56:31.280 --> 02:56:36.000]  people. And of course, it goes back to the few years back when we realized that
[02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:41.040]  the local police were being informed, educated by bad guys sent in from
[02:56:41.040 --> 02:56:46.320]  Washington, explaining that if somebody, if you stop somebody for speeding, if they
[02:56:46.320 --> 02:56:51.120]  quote the Constitution, consider them to be a terrorist. I mean, this was a
[02:56:51.120 --> 02:56:55.680]  literally part of the educational program just a couple years ago for the local
[02:56:55.680 --> 02:57:01.000]  police. Oh my gosh, it was a school career day and the kid didn't clean, oh my, he
[02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:05.040]  left, I guess, a bubblegum wrapper in there so they tasered the kid. Listen,
[02:57:05.040 --> 02:57:09.200]  what about these cases where cops now attack just innocent people? I've seen
[02:57:09.200 --> 02:57:12.960]  like wolves will attack a sheep that's injured and I think it's a predatory
[02:57:12.960 --> 02:57:16.800]  instinct with the psychos they're hiring now, where every day we see articles
[02:57:16.800 --> 02:57:20.000]  where they attack an old woman who's even done nothing in a wheelchair or a
[02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:24.080]  little, or like an old woman, they shove them down on the street. They drag them,
[02:57:24.080 --> 02:57:27.840]  drag them out through the window, throw them down on the street, and kick them
[02:57:27.840 --> 02:57:31.120]  and put their head, their hands, excuse me, put their feet down on the head of
[02:57:31.120 --> 02:57:35.520]  the person we're talking about and they're doing it to grandma. I can't
[02:57:35.520 --> 02:57:41.680]  believe it. And they seemingly, again, are getting away with it. You know, we
[02:57:41.680 --> 02:57:48.720]  have, it upsets me to see it because, you know, it's something that 20, 40, 50 years
[02:57:48.720 --> 02:57:53.360]  ago, you would have had the entire community out throwing stones at the
[02:57:53.360 --> 02:57:57.840]  police officer for doing something like that. Well, Bob, it's over the top though
[02:57:57.840 --> 02:58:01.200]  and it's meant to run the good cops out, he won't be around it.
[02:58:01.200 --> 02:58:05.520]  I mean, you see this and they now go, it's good to taser someone having a
[02:58:05.520 --> 02:58:09.440]  seizure if they don't follow your orders. I mean, that's a person having a
[02:58:09.440 --> 02:58:13.600]  seizure. They're unconscious. It's, it's, it's, well, yeah, and a good, a good
[02:58:13.600 --> 02:58:18.080]  electrical, um, uh, tasing sure that you're gonna help the seizure.
[02:58:18.080 --> 02:58:22.240]  That's insane. I can't even believe it, but we're watching it. We're watching,
[02:58:22.240 --> 02:58:26.160]  hey, you know, folks are getting away with it. Hey, Bob Fletcher, thank you so
[02:58:26.160 --> 02:58:30.560]  much. Look forward to speaking to you soon. Thank you. The news, folks, is so over
[02:58:30.560 --> 02:58:34.320]  the top, I can't even believe it. And then you see the video of it. Cops
[02:58:34.320 --> 02:58:38.400]  beating up old ladies just for fun. I mean, it is just pure demonic
[02:58:38.400 --> 02:58:42.800]  possession that is happening.
[02:58:42.800 --> 02:58:51.040]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.040 --> 02:58:55.200]  The worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks
[02:58:55.200 --> 02:58:59.280]  the hottest half year on record. 78% of the Midwest corn belt is in
[02:58:59.280 --> 02:59:02.560]  drought conditions. Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits,
[02:59:02.560 --> 02:59:05.600]  vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[02:59:05.600 --> 02:59:09.040]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business.
[02:59:09.040 --> 02:59:12.720]  Blowing up your food prices. The only strategy to counter this is to
[02:59:12.720 --> 02:59:16.720]  freeze your food costs to today's prices by getting your own supply of foods
[02:59:16.720 --> 02:59:20.320]  from eFoods Direct now. As the price of raw ingredients increases,
[02:59:20.320 --> 02:59:23.840]  eFoods will have to raise prices too. Now is the time to get your supply.
[02:59:23.840 --> 02:59:27.360]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods Direct because we've all known this
[02:59:27.360 --> 02:59:29.760]  was coming. You know about their delicious, long-term
[02:59:29.760 --> 02:59:32.880]  storable foods. The fact is you can eat it any time to save
[02:59:32.880 --> 02:59:36.640]  money today. And because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices
[02:59:36.640 --> 02:59:41.280]  and avoiding the rising food cost. Don't wait. Call 800-409-5633
[02:59:41.280 --> 02:59:46.320]  or go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex. Call 800-409-5633
[02:59:46.320 --> 03:00:04.080]  or eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex. You can bet your life on eFoods Direct.
[03:00:16.800 --> 03:00:20.400]  And a lot of times go into the fourth hour of this little five-minute segment.
[03:00:20.400 --> 03:00:23.120]  Sometimes the whole fourth hour is live. It's kind of the dessert.
[03:00:24.640 --> 03:00:31.600]  The beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad, so I had one more for dessert. No, I haven't had any beer.
[03:00:32.320 --> 03:00:35.360]  That's a Johnny Cash quote, ladies and gentlemen. I just can't help it.
[03:00:36.800 --> 03:00:42.080]  Let's go to Kenny in Maryland there on the Storm's Path. Thank you for joining us
[03:00:42.080 --> 03:00:45.360]  while you're under attack by Sandy, sir. Thank you for your stalwart
[03:00:45.360 --> 03:00:48.160]  Stelik waiting on hold. Go ahead.
[03:00:48.800 --> 03:00:53.360]  All right. Thanks, Alex. I appreciate it. A question for Bob Fletcher on harp.
[03:00:53.360 --> 03:00:55.520]  Unfortunately, he's gone now, but go ahead.
[03:00:56.160 --> 03:01:03.120]  Oh, okay. Cool. No problem. Just last week, the Monday, I was seeing a lot of chemtrails around.
[03:01:03.680 --> 03:01:10.080]  And just Saturday morning, it was quite clear by swell that chemtrails, I guess,
[03:01:10.080 --> 03:01:16.960]  had formed and made that gray cloud that spoke of. And there was actually a ring around the sun as well.
[03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:21.280]  That BBC admits that's when they're doing weather modification. I mean,
[03:01:21.280 --> 03:01:25.440]  they've got articles about it and just show it. I mean, the point is they're just doing it.
[03:01:25.440 --> 03:01:29.360]  They admit they're doing it, but say we're doing something suckers, but we're not going to tell
[03:01:29.360 --> 03:01:36.320]  you. So roll over and die. I mean, it's just amazing. She said it looked like a force field.
[03:01:36.320 --> 03:01:42.000]  It definitely did that. And the storm prayers to prayer goes goes out to all the families lost.
[03:01:44.000 --> 03:01:48.720]  It didn't really hit hit hard here in Maryland. It didn't didn't really touch home. I mean,
[03:01:48.720 --> 03:01:54.080]  it was just a strong storm. Yeah. Yeah, I know it's it's really bad in areas that are low like New
[03:01:54.080 --> 03:01:57.760]  York, Manhattan, things like that. Well, God bless you, sir. Good to hear from you. Sorry,
[03:01:57.760 --> 03:02:02.320]  you couldn't talk to Bob or we just we just wanted to do this segment to take your calls.
[03:02:02.320 --> 03:02:07.920]  Chris in New York hardest hit from what I've seen. What's your take on this, Chris?
[03:02:09.280 --> 03:02:15.760]  How you doing there, Alex? Good, sir. All right. Well, I'm here in upstate New York about 30 miles
[03:02:15.760 --> 03:02:22.880]  from New York City. New Jersey got it really bad. A lot of devastation over there. And the bad thing
[03:02:22.880 --> 03:02:28.160]  though is that the trains, a lot of the trains have been canceled and shut down. So the transportation
[03:02:28.160 --> 03:02:35.840]  system is not really good. So this is a really devastating storm. And there were about 30 people
[03:02:35.840 --> 03:02:42.400]  died. So I think that this is whoever caused that. I really can't say but it really is devastating.
[03:02:43.280 --> 03:02:47.120]  Devastating there in New York, we've seen the images no doubt. How are you faring?
[03:02:48.480 --> 03:02:57.200]  I'm okay because our electricity was flickering on and off. But overall, our area wasn't that
[03:02:57.200 --> 03:03:03.440]  bad. Although there were some trees down on the street, some paths were blocked.
[03:03:07.520 --> 03:03:12.080]  Well, sir, we will continue to track it all. Thank you for that update in New York, Chris. Let's talk
[03:03:12.080 --> 03:03:17.840]  to Taylor in Oregon a little. Well, no, we need to I promised maybe wasn't clear. We're taking
[03:03:17.840 --> 03:03:21.840]  calls from the storm. So let's go to Chris first and mask Chris real quick and mask. Go ahead.
[03:03:21.840 --> 03:03:27.360]  Or I guess it is tailing. Go ahead, Taylor in Oregon. Go ahead.
[03:03:28.400 --> 03:03:33.280]  Hello? Can you hear me? Yes, sure can. You bet. Awesome. It's been a while. I've been trying.
[03:03:33.280 --> 03:03:38.480]  Okay, so I actually have an opinion on the storm. They could, I think that possibly they could,
[03:03:39.040 --> 03:03:44.080]  you know, it could just come off as a fluke and they were over hyping it. You know, well,
[03:03:44.080 --> 03:03:49.840]  I don't know how long the storms gonna last, but you know, that could be part of their, I guess,
[03:03:49.840 --> 03:03:53.840]  plan if you will, or they may not be in complete control of the weather with the sun and moon and
[03:03:53.840 --> 03:03:59.600]  the gravity being more powerful than what they've done. It's certainly a thousand mile wide monster
[03:03:59.600 --> 03:04:05.120]  Mac rain wise. And like you said, the death toll is 25. That guy was saying 30. But I mean,
[03:04:05.120 --> 03:04:11.600]  it's certainly a serious issue if you're under it right now. Yeah, well, my prayers go out to the
[03:04:11.600 --> 03:04:16.560]  people on the East. Absolutely. My prayers go out to those being bombed by globalist drones all
[03:04:16.560 --> 03:04:22.160]  over the world. Well, they say I will kill 2050 100 200 people who are innocent to get one bad
[03:04:22.160 --> 03:04:26.560]  guy. They're they're not humans. They're just foreigners. The globalists think the same thing
[03:04:26.560 --> 03:04:32.800]  of you. I appreciate your call, sir. The big news I didn't cover enough here is Jesse Ventura,
[03:04:32.800 --> 03:04:39.760]  the TSA episode killed will not air. And it's like, Hey, we're starting to shut down stuff we
[03:04:39.760 --> 03:04:43.840]  don't like. How does that sound? You scum out there? Well, I don't think you're scum. I think
[03:04:43.840 --> 03:04:47.680]  you're going to stand up against them. And if you serve the system, you better decide which side
[03:04:47.680 --> 03:04:52.480]  you're on because let me tell you, we're hurling towards disaster. We're on the eve of really
[03:04:52.480 --> 03:04:58.080]  serious collapse. If this insanity continues, big nightly news tonight, seven o'clock central
[03:04:58.080 --> 03:05:14.160]  prison planet dot TV.
