[02:33.280 --> 02:39.400]  into Mexico and they've got dumbed down
[02:39.400 --> 02:47.440]  psychically obese morons posing as federal officers sticking their hands
[02:47.440 --> 02:52.200]  down people's pants everywhere and when you don't like the TSA grabbing your
[02:52.200 --> 02:56.240]  genitals or sticking their hands down your babies diaper and fondling them or
[02:56.240 --> 03:02.600]  robbing your bags or hitting on your wife I got some new horrors today where
[03:02.600 --> 03:06.200]  they take chocolate cakes out of people's bags and eat them and then
[03:06.200 --> 03:14.000]  laugh about it I mean it's reached la la land levels and yesterday I had another
[03:14.000 --> 03:18.920]  police officer who was in major magazines on TV admittedly this second
[03:18.920 --> 03:24.920]  person to respond to the Oklahoma City bombing Mr. Browning Don Browning and
[03:24.920 --> 03:31.200]  he's he's sitting there talking about in the police headquarters a week after it
[03:31.200 --> 03:37.040]  FBI agents walking up and saying we'll kill you and your wife if you investigate
[03:37.040 --> 03:43.280]  what we're doing and he's told over the years national news this you know why
[03:43.280 --> 03:47.000]  one reason this film got made is one of the camera guys in Oklahoma because
[03:47.000 --> 03:51.480]  national media will hire the local videographer had been there in the
[03:51.480 --> 03:56.280]  history channel discovery channel ABC news pieces seeing all these witnesses
[03:56.280 --> 04:03.720]  say this and it never being put on national news I mean that's how criminal
[04:03.720 --> 04:08.040]  this government is and they didn't just threaten cops they killed some of them
[04:08.040 --> 04:13.680]  and the local police all stood down you pull up they've killed the cop and
[04:13.680 --> 04:16.560]  tortured him on federal property so they can take control the investigation and
[04:16.560 --> 04:21.080]  they don't even try to send police to look into it all this stuff about how
[04:21.080 --> 04:24.760]  the government loves the troops and loves the police and let me tell you
[04:24.760 --> 04:29.040]  something you are dirt to the criminals that run this system and remember that
[04:29.040 --> 04:34.000]  all the pageantry and in Houston a few years ago they shut down major highways
[04:34.000 --> 04:37.440]  and had thousands of police from all of the state there for a police dog that
[04:37.440 --> 04:42.520]  got shot that's all to make you think they care about you that's all to make
[04:42.520 --> 04:46.440]  you think the gang you're a member of is going to be there for you it's the
[04:46.440 --> 04:51.800]  opposite they'll murder you with pleasure and then murder your wife if you
[04:51.800 --> 04:59.440]  don't like it okay that's who runs this country total evil stay with us
[04:59.440 --> 05:03.320]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[05:03.320 --> 05:07.680]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[05:07.680 --> 05:11.840]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[05:11.840 --> 05:15.880]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[05:15.880 --> 05:19.760]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[05:19.760 --> 05:24.040]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[05:24.040 --> 05:28.200]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[05:28.200 --> 05:32.480]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[05:32.480 --> 05:36.200]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[05:36.200 --> 05:40.400]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[05:40.400 --> 05:43.760]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution
[05:43.760 --> 05:47.400]  from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at
[05:47.400 --> 05:53.040]  www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com remember the government

[08:05.280 --> 08:12.120]  brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[08:12.120 --> 08:19.640]  he keys Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[08:19.640 --> 08:23.120]  Alex Joe's
[08:38.840 --> 08:44.680]  all right my friends we are going to be here live for the next three hours it
[08:44.680 --> 08:52.160]  is December 23rd 2011 on this Friday edition and we have defense con not even
[08:52.160 --> 08:57.120]  contractor civil servant Navy veteran who works in classified areas of the
[08:57.120 --> 09:02.000]  Department of Defense who has been pointing out to us a sensitive but
[09:02.000 --> 09:08.360]  public documents that are on the federal government's bid process website with
[09:08.360 --> 09:13.040]  the whole Homeland Security seal on it and he'll be joining us coming up about
[09:13.040 --> 09:17.920]  an hour and a half here on the radio broadcast to help go through these
[09:17.920 --> 09:22.960]  documents and decipher them dealing with the FEMA camps now since he pointed
[09:22.960 --> 09:27.240]  out these documents to us within about an hour and a half of us linking to them
[09:27.240 --> 09:33.840]  two days ago back on Wednesday evening it was removed and they put a cryptic
[09:33.840 --> 09:38.920]  message up there about this could be classified now it was marked sensitive
[09:38.920 --> 09:43.600]  but it's a public purchase and so what government's done is it's tried to make
[09:43.600 --> 09:47.280]  more and more stuff classified but I've seen reports that millions of news
[09:47.280 --> 09:53.560]  articles have been classified by the CIA that means in their clandestine
[09:53.560 --> 10:00.360]  research laboratories and analysis laboratories they don't want other
[10:00.360 --> 10:07.280]  members of the agencies even reading the news so this is an attempt to
[10:07.280 --> 10:11.440]  basically have the national security state swallow up society and then we're
[10:11.440 --> 10:16.120]  basically all insecure because those that quote are guarding everything just
[10:16.120 --> 10:21.720]  decide to take over the society it's the same story we've seen in
[10:21.720 --> 10:27.400]  civilization over and over and over again in the 6,000 years of recorded
[10:27.400 --> 10:33.840]  history okay I do want to get to your phone calls a little bit earlier in
[10:33.840 --> 10:37.440]  this hour than I usually do but I want listeners to have your point to have
[10:37.440 --> 10:40.840]  your question ready I'm gonna attempt this again and I've never achieved it
[10:40.840 --> 10:45.280]  but I've gotten close one minute each caller 15 second response I want to give
[10:45.280 --> 10:48.920]  you a chance because I love hearing from you to bring up news issues things we
[10:48.920 --> 10:53.480]  haven't covered questions comments you name it the toll-free number to join us
[10:53.480 --> 11:01.480]  is 800-259-9231-800-259-9231 you can go ahead and load the phones up
[11:01.480 --> 11:06.840]  right now on any issue that you wish to discuss or any of the issues that I am
[11:06.840 --> 11:15.120]  about to go over here today but here's an interesting article that I meant to
[11:15.120 --> 11:18.240]  get to yesterday so I'm gonna cover it now out of the gates before I get into
[11:18.240 --> 11:24.400]  all the top stories EU carbon tax court upholds carbon trade plan for
[11:24.400 --> 11:34.320]  aviation and it goes on to say Europe is adopting this massive surcharge that
[11:34.320 --> 11:38.920]  is to be added to all people flying in or out of Europe this affects Asia this
[11:38.920 --> 11:43.360]  affects North America and will basically force the adoption here because
[11:43.360 --> 11:46.960]  these are international airlines many of them based or part of their system
[11:46.960 --> 11:50.920]  based in the United States so it's the mega corporations just going along with
[11:50.920 --> 11:58.000]  it taxing carbon dioxide that plants breathe and so there you have it and
[11:58.000 --> 12:03.480]  the Financial Times of London has a report here China warns EU of carbon
[12:03.480 --> 12:08.320]  tax trade war China has warned the European Union to abandon its
[12:08.320 --> 12:13.880]  controversial carbon tax on airlines or risk-provoking a global trade war
[12:13.880 --> 12:17.600]  adding weight to the warning an industry insider told the Financial Times the
[12:17.600 --> 12:21.200]  Chinese government was seriously considering measures to hit back at the
[12:21.200 --> 12:24.680]  EU if it insists on charging international airlines that means you
[12:24.680 --> 12:28.840]  come in there you pay them for their carbon emissions and for China will not
[12:28.840 --> 12:33.600]  implement this we implement we're shutting down I mean as if we can't
[12:33.600 --> 12:36.880]  compete with a slave labor on top of it or dumping toxic waste right in the
[12:36.880 --> 12:41.480]  rivers and then we have more and more regulations here they have no workers
[12:41.480 --> 12:45.920]  comp no social security nothing I mean Mao Zedong set that up with the
[12:45.920 --> 12:53.000]  globalist back in the 60s they'd made well they made deals in the late 40s but
[12:53.000 --> 12:58.760]  but the deals became codified in the 60s and 70s this is all going on and China
[12:58.760 --> 13:04.080]  says we're just going to be exempt from that adding weight to the warning an
[13:04.080 --> 13:07.640]  industry insider told the Financial Times the Chinese government was seriously
[13:07.640 --> 13:12.280]  considering measures to hit back at the EU if it insists on charging international
[13:12.280 --> 13:16.600]  airlines for their carbon emissions in a case initiated by US Airlines the
[13:16.600 --> 13:19.960]  European Court of Justice ruled Wednesday that the EU's carbon emission
[13:19.960 --> 13:24.400]  trading scheme did not infringe on the sovereignty of other nations and that it
[13:24.400 --> 13:29.400]  was compatible with international law it's a tariff ladies and gentlemen the
[13:29.400 --> 13:33.640]  course where they paid to the big mega banks the big six it was a Goldman Sachs
[13:33.640 --> 13:40.600]  JP Morgan Al Gore Bill Clinton and Ken lay on record who created the carbon
[13:40.600 --> 13:50.880]  tax scheme in meetings in 1995 there's no end to what these crooks demand okay
[13:50.880 --> 13:58.240]  continuing here before I go to the call so I've got to tell a story about tell
[13:58.240 --> 14:01.200]  them you know asking my wife I said listen we don't really have any cash
[14:01.200 --> 14:06.920]  we've got some gold and silver you need to get out of our savings some cash but
[14:06.920 --> 14:12.480]  it wasn't even above the $10,000 amount and the banks were calling me frantically
[14:12.480 --> 14:16.880]  yesterday they they balked it you're giving her money and before she's pulled
[14:16.880 --> 14:20.040]  out even just a few thousand and they've act all freak out and I'm trying to use
[14:20.040 --> 14:27.440]  a local bank you know that's a hundred percent in in Texas and I mean you would
[14:27.440 --> 14:34.760]  think I mean look all of America is a giant prison now I told the story where
[14:34.760 --> 14:39.320]  I went into the YMCA in a rural area where I live outside Austin and I and I
[14:39.320 --> 14:43.400]  walk up there's nobody around and I get a tour and I say okay well I want to go
[14:43.400 --> 14:46.520]  ahead and sign up for a family and they said well you want to wait you know
[14:46.520 --> 14:52.760]  being quote nice to after Christmas because you'll get a discount no sign-up
[14:52.760 --> 14:58.280]  fee and I said okay I said well can I go ahead and just pay to work out today and
[14:58.280 --> 15:05.240]  they said oh there's a three you know time you know free trial let's just give
[15:05.240 --> 15:07.800]  us your driver's license someone at the car got my driver's license so we're
[15:07.800 --> 15:13.560]  gonna work out with it and I came back in and she looks at it and she says she
[15:13.560 --> 15:19.520]  says this is in Austin she live here and I said yeah Austin's like city limits
[15:19.520 --> 15:25.880]  five miles away but you haven't changed this yet that's illegal I was going well
[15:25.880 --> 15:29.680]  what are you worried about it for I mean I'm just here to lift weights man this
[15:29.680 --> 15:35.720]  isn't a stinking airport I mean it look they take petty people and they get off
[15:35.720 --> 15:41.000]  on this minder deal and I've seen it again when they're literally carting
[15:41.000 --> 15:45.200]  75 80 year old women buying beer or old men buying a bottle of wine at the
[15:45.200 --> 15:50.280]  grocery store and I'll watch them zit face 17 year old interrogate some person
[15:50.280 --> 15:54.800]  walking with a cane and I just start shooting my mouth off they go it's our
[15:54.800 --> 15:59.400]  policy to card everyone buying pipe tobacco or beer or wine and I'm like oh
[15:59.400 --> 16:03.680]  yeah you have to be mindless you're not allowed to make your own determination
[16:03.680 --> 16:09.360]  though you look a little young let me see your card it's this it's totally sick
[16:09.360 --> 16:16.280]  it's totally sick I mean this is the opposite of what freedom is and so I'm
[16:16.280 --> 16:20.040]  on the phone might as well just tell the story now they say it starts with
[16:20.040 --> 16:24.880]  Wala money or says ringing ringing ringing ringing yesterday at about 130 and
[16:24.880 --> 16:30.600]  calls at home and and emails I later learned it oh oh my gosh you know you're
[16:30.600 --> 16:36.920]  why and so my wife comes in and she's got some checks to deposit and it's our
[16:36.920 --> 16:41.840]  private checking account and she wants to get some cash out as we've been telling
[16:41.840 --> 16:46.000]  everybody that they should do and all our experts agree because cash we pulled
[16:46.000 --> 16:50.000]  out a year ago you know we spent on odds and ends and things and we're getting
[16:50.000 --> 16:54.320]  some more cash and it's not even up to the level that they're supposed to you
[16:54.320 --> 16:59.040]  know quote report you to financial crimes and enforcement who doesn't know
[16:59.040 --> 17:02.640]  where the billion 200 million core design money went of course they know

[17:06.800 --> 17:09.720]  don't know where it is it's all completely tracked in lifetime but they
[17:09.720 --> 17:14.160]  don't know and the course has been caught lying to Congress but so what he's
[17:14.160 --> 17:18.480]  not gonna get in trouble and so all of this is going on you know Wacovia Wells
[17:18.480 --> 17:24.000]  Fargo laundered 376 billion dollars in two years don't get in trouble
[17:24.000 --> 17:28.200]  government didn't know running the aircraft that fly the cocaine that all
[17:28.200 --> 17:30.400]  comes out AP Reuters nobody gets in trouble
[17:30.400 --> 17:34.920]  Bloomberg as well but here we are you know a couple thousand dollars out of
[17:34.920 --> 17:39.920]  the bank a few thousand dollars out of the bank and she goes up and the woman

[24:28.720 --> 24:36.760]  down when the man comes around when the man comes around well let me expand on
[24:36.760 --> 24:42.720]  this all over the United States hairs on your arm will stand but in Texas we've
[24:42.720 --> 24:46.440]  gotten really famous for this on national news because they'd love to
[24:46.440 --> 24:50.960]  always make local police look bad so the feds who are even worse on average can
[24:50.960 --> 24:55.760]  come in and take over with their federal takeovers of your towns and cities but
[24:55.760 --> 25:00.840]  they'll show police chiefs and judges going that's right if we pull you over
[25:00.840 --> 25:06.040]  and you have even $500 in your wallet purse we're taking it as contraband
[25:06.040 --> 25:11.920]  under asset forfeiture seizure no drugs or crimes needed that's what the regs
[25:11.920 --> 25:18.800]  say and they just Anderson Cooper puts it on news mr. CIA who tells you how
[25:18.800 --> 25:23.080]  great it is that our troops grow the opium in Afghanistan and I and I by no
[25:23.080 --> 25:29.360]  means am to defending the local police and I again I've been pulled over in
[25:29.360 --> 25:32.680]  some of these small towns in East Texas and places where the cops have giant
[25:32.680 --> 25:37.560]  swastikas on their arms I mean you're like what on earth is going on here but
[25:37.560 --> 25:41.960]  the issue is yes I as I told you last week I was pulled over once as a
[25:41.960 --> 25:46.360]  teenager with a guy with a swastika on his forearm and a swastika on his arm
[25:46.360 --> 25:50.960]  on his side of his arm he was wearing short sleeves I mean can you imagine
[25:50.960 --> 25:55.960]  being a minority pulled over by that guy the point is it's wild open season but
[25:55.960 --> 25:59.960]  even the state police before it was a famous case where an old woman that had
[25:59.960 --> 26:04.760]  like $3,000 in her purse and they just took it what's this in your purse well
[26:04.760 --> 26:08.400]  when I travel sonny I care enough money to fix my car do whatever I'm going to
[26:08.400 --> 26:15.320]  visit family in Kansas and they said no you're not we're taking the money and so
[26:15.320 --> 26:22.200]  you you go to your bank account I mean what if I would have wanted all the money
[26:22.200 --> 26:27.600]  out of my bank account you know they never have a question though when you're
[26:27.600 --> 26:32.360]  depositing it though but you want some of it out and all of this is about
[26:32.360 --> 26:35.960]  teaching you that you're a criminal all of this is about teaching you to be
[26:35.960 --> 26:40.040]  spied on and I try to explain it to these to the bank manager I was talking
[26:40.040 --> 26:43.760]  to this morning as I was haranguing the poor person and he was saying well I'm
[26:43.760 --> 26:48.400]  just doing my job don't be paranoid we're not spying on you oh you're not
[26:48.400 --> 26:54.160]  spying on me no you just fill out financial crimes enforcement reports on
[26:54.160 --> 27:02.040]  me well you don't don't be afraid sir I'm not afraid of that I'm afraid of what
[27:02.040 --> 27:06.560]  it means that you accept this like it's no big deal and the rest of society does
[27:06.560 --> 27:12.280]  well I'm just doing my job yeah I heard that before and I'm like don't you
[27:12.280 --> 27:15.480]  understand Corzine is allowed to run off with billions yeah I know about that
[27:15.480 --> 27:19.360]  don't you did you hear about Wacovi and Wells Fargo laundering hundreds of
[27:19.360 --> 27:24.120]  billions yeah I heard about that oh but but a guy wanting to thousands of
[27:24.120 --> 27:30.000]  dollars out of the bank that's that's evil and again I understand that's just a
[27:30.000 --> 27:36.360]  minion at a bank I get it but when you walk up to any under Patriot Act
[27:36.360 --> 27:43.760]  compliance any hotel any rental car any place period now you see the people on
[27:43.760 --> 27:47.280]  the power trip with their little suits and they try to ask him where you go and
[27:47.280 --> 27:51.240]  I'm here to visit my cousin or I'm here for business oh what business is that and
[27:51.240 --> 27:55.440]  they're a script and I go hey I understand this is Patriot Act and they
[27:55.440 --> 27:58.920]  tell you your little secret agent now and you have little seminars are like oh
[27:58.920 --> 28:02.640]  really you do you know one woman's going you're right and I know where you
[28:02.640 --> 28:06.360]  really live this isn't really your address on your driver's license is it
[28:06.360 --> 28:12.560]  no I moved that's right you live here and I'm like oh you're on a power trip and
[28:12.560 --> 28:16.160]  I go the mega banks you love so much are gonna suck you dry you like the fact
[28:16.160 --> 28:18.560]  you're not doing as well as you were doing just five years ago because we're
[28:18.560 --> 28:22.400]  really a depression you're gonna be destroyed by the little petty system
[28:22.400 --> 28:26.400]  you like now sir I'm just trying to do my job yeah you are just doing your job
[28:26.400 --> 28:30.480]  aren't you just like that state police got pulls me over church want to search
[28:30.480 --> 28:35.840]  my car and I'm like I don't run narcotics like your criminal bosses do I'm not
[28:35.840 --> 28:39.480]  involved like the state government here working with Dinecore kidnaping kids or
[28:39.480 --> 28:43.880]  the state youth commission with the big rape rooms that came out with the judges
[28:43.880 --> 28:49.040]  and all the rest of them in there with the kids I'm not involved in all that and
[28:49.040 --> 28:52.680]  I looked at him and I said this system's gonna destroy you and then he goes no I

[29:08.080 --> 29:12.000]  freaks me out to talk to cops off air over the years and then have them
[29:12.000 --> 29:15.720]  actually come on air now and go yeah most of the department knows the feds

[34:34.120 --> 34:40.920]  and what the cowards do is they just burrow more into it they just give into
[34:40.920 --> 34:45.320]  it even more and then they act like those of us they're saying that we got the
[34:45.320 --> 34:50.760]  problem and so I want to explain something to the bank tellers I want to
[34:50.760 --> 34:55.240]  explain something to the gun shop dealers everybody else everybody wants to
[34:55.240 --> 35:01.080]  mislabel things so you think it's okay I remember 16 years ago having a couple
[35:01.080 --> 35:05.960]  gun shops that had good guns and good prices on as sponsors when I was just
[35:05.960 --> 35:10.360]  on local radio and they were making money hand over fist and that's great
[35:10.360 --> 35:13.960]  because I believe in you know making money in the free market and getting
[35:13.960 --> 35:19.960]  implements of liberty out there to the public and I would get on experts on
[35:19.960 --> 35:26.280]  air and talk about how judge you know judges at the Supreme Court had ruled
[35:26.280 --> 35:32.960]  that Sheriff Richard Mack was right 10th Amendment violation Brady build
[35:32.960 --> 35:37.920]  violated states rights and a bunch of other issues that you couldn't have a
[35:37.920 --> 35:43.560]  five-day waiting period and that ruling to come down the Supreme Court and we
[35:43.560 --> 35:49.280]  were having Sheriff Richard Mack on and the both the sponsors called after I
[35:49.280 --> 35:52.920]  had him on a few times and said stop saying we register guns now that we've
[35:52.920 --> 35:57.360]  gone to the next instant check it's cutting back on sales plus it's not a
[35:57.360 --> 36:03.880]  registration and I said to the sponsors I said I I said this is a
[36:03.880 --> 36:10.560]  registration your name and you're buying a handgun rifle or shotgun and then
[36:10.560 --> 36:14.320]  they know that it's on file the serial number right there but basically how
[36:14.320 --> 36:17.920]  many guns you've got in your address under penalty of perjury that is
[36:17.920 --> 36:24.800]  registration as a gun owner period and I said I'm sorry I I cannot shut up about
[36:24.800 --> 36:29.920]  this and one of the sponsors left and then later got so harassed by the
[36:29.920 --> 36:33.760]  government anyways like other gun dealers they went into a vitamin business
[36:33.760 --> 36:38.600]  and did quite well but the point is and the other one didn't like it but
[36:38.600 --> 36:41.960]  understood but then I got calls from other gun dealers saying don't do this
[36:41.960 --> 36:45.720]  it's hurting business hey you're gonna lose the whole business and you're gonna
[36:45.720 --> 36:48.480]  lose the second amendment that's a lot more important than your stinking
[36:48.480 --> 36:53.520]  business pal if we don't tell the truth I am not gonna shut up for a sponsor I'm
[36:53.520 --> 36:57.480]  not gonna shut up for anybody I'm willing to die for the truth you think
[36:57.480 --> 37:03.000]  I'm gonna sell out for some money but see you sell out by lying to yourselves oh
[37:03.000 --> 37:10.520]  we don't really register people I've been in gun shops before and I said okay
[37:10.520 --> 37:14.280]  let's get this registration process over with look out my driver's license
[37:14.280 --> 37:19.160]  they're like sir it's not a registration I'm like feed that line of bull to
[37:19.160 --> 37:23.460]  somebody else now I'm gonna preach at you I bet you support George Bush don't
[37:23.460 --> 37:28.200]  you he supports the assault weapons ban this was a few years ago in McBrides I
[37:28.200 --> 37:32.440]  was there buying that shotgun to recreate the chain he's shooting to prove
[37:32.440 --> 37:36.480]  that he shot the guy closer than what he said and the guys like if I don't like
[37:36.480 --> 37:41.360]  you saying that Bush supports that I've heard you that's not true and the owner
[37:41.360 --> 37:47.640]  comes over goes that's actually true the guy's like huh but but the point is is
[37:47.640 --> 37:55.200]  that it's a lie it is a registration but that's a side issue the central point
[37:55.200 --> 37:59.560]  I'm getting at here before I go to the top stories in your calls is that they
[37:59.560 --> 38:04.040]  don't the ATF six months ago we got this first from a local gun dealer before
[38:04.040 --> 38:08.680]  was even in the news we broke it the ATF was sending letters and agents if
[38:08.680 --> 38:14.680]  needed to local gun shops to say you are going to report more than one rifle
[38:14.680 --> 38:21.160]  sale to us in writing and with a phone call or will arrest you and take your
[38:21.160 --> 38:26.520]  license and or both and of course that was outside of law they just tried to
[38:26.520 --> 38:30.280]  pass a law to do that they couldn't pass it so they just said we'll just do it
[38:30.280 --> 38:34.400]  we're criminal enterprise will do it we're folks that ship drugs into the
[38:34.400 --> 38:38.240]  country and guns out of the country and guns to gangs around the country that's
[38:38.240 --> 38:41.240]  all come out in fashion furious the mainstream media only covers the upper
[38:41.240 --> 38:45.520]  crust the upper part of the tip of the iceberg one snowflake on top and
[38:45.520 --> 38:48.640]  actually mainstream media has covered the drug dealing but it's Chicago Tribune
[38:48.640 --> 38:53.080]  El Paso times now New York Times I guess I guess they have kind of covered it
[38:53.080 --> 38:55.840]  lately but it's like well they just laundered the money and run the drugs to
[38:55.840 --> 38:59.360]  keep track of everything of course you understand the 500 billion that they
[38:59.360 --> 39:03.400]  they just they just you know these agents just live in $3 million houses for no
[39:03.400 --> 39:07.040]  reason I remember being in high school and going over and visiting my buddy whose
[39:07.040 --> 39:13.600]  dad was an FBI agent's house it was like you know fanciest area of Austin all
[39:13.600 --> 39:17.240]  these rich people saw some famous people there and I'm like what is this is your
[39:17.240 --> 39:20.520]  do you is your dad in a fit independently wealthy they're like why are you asking
[39:20.520 --> 39:25.680]  those questions the point is this is how America runs and if somebody gets in the
[39:25.680 --> 39:30.800]  way of it like a cop in Oklahoma City hey why are there bombs here you guys we
[39:30.800 --> 39:35.200]  know where your daughter goes to school we'll kill your daughter another cop by
[39:35.200 --> 39:38.880]  the water cooler FBI walks over we're gonna kill you and your wife you keep
[39:38.880 --> 39:44.560]  asking questions we're the FBI and everybody's afraid of them and everybody
[39:44.560 --> 39:48.680]  bows down to them that's like when the FBI showed up here one time digging
[39:48.680 --> 39:53.360]  around I couldn't help it I mean I was like a dog in a backyard that sees you
[39:53.360 --> 39:58.960]  know a prowler I couldn't help it I puffed up and walked down I said what
[39:58.960 --> 40:04.600]  are you doing here you work for terrorists I'm good and they just don't
[40:04.600 --> 40:09.840]  know how to deal with that they don't know how to deal with it I've broken the
[40:09.840 --> 40:15.360]  trance I know what I'm talking about I am not putting up with it anymore and I
[40:15.360 --> 40:19.680]  know most FBI agents are investigating you know missing people in bank robberies
[40:19.680 --> 40:24.120]  I know most of you aren't criminals but most German soldiers weren't killing
[40:24.120 --> 40:28.480]  people either in death camps I mean most Soviets weren't bad people
[40:28.480 --> 40:34.200]  individually but they followed orders that led to a greater evil I'm really
[40:34.200 --> 40:41.200]  having I'm gonna be honest with you it's not even shaken up it is stone cold
[40:41.200 --> 40:46.440]  awake which in a land of loony tune people that put up with tyranny I guess
[40:46.440 --> 40:51.760]  I am stone cold crazy because last night I could barely dinner I got home
[40:51.760 --> 40:57.680]  about 730 my wife had made me this incredible dinner made the children
[40:57.680 --> 41:02.360]  wait I sat down sir eating and she made me a steak with mushrooms all over it
[41:02.360 --> 41:05.480]  all this stuff and I could it couldn't even eat it even though it tasted great
[41:05.480 --> 41:11.640]  because I was so freaked out by that incredibly credible police officer who's
[41:11.640 --> 41:15.360]  on record one of the heroes of Oklahoma City going into the building right you
[41:15.360 --> 41:20.840]  know a minute after the explosion all of it see in the feds all of it and then
[41:20.840 --> 41:24.760]  the FBI two different agents come to him at the police department a week later
[41:24.760 --> 41:28.640]  and say you keep your mouth shut and don't call for an investigation or we're
[41:28.640 --> 41:33.280]  gonna kill you and your wife and then he goes to the to his lieutenant and goes
[41:33.280 --> 41:36.400]  to the chief and they're like shut up or we'll just have you arrested as a
[41:36.400 --> 41:41.960]  militia person maybe you were part of the bombing I mean that's basically how
[41:41.960 --> 41:47.000]  America works and then they and then they killed Oklahoma City police and
[41:47.000 --> 41:51.640]  others tortured him to death and the police all stood down and got scared and
[41:51.640 --> 41:56.160]  now 15 years later most of the police in the department are awake and freaked
[41:56.160 --> 42:02.520]  out and saying we're scared you're scared I mean I'm scared of being scared
[42:02.520 --> 42:07.200]  when I get scared I get aggressive you understand because I realize there's no
[42:07.200 --> 42:10.440]  where to run folks there's no country the New World Order hadn't already taken
[42:10.440 --> 42:17.520]  over there's nowhere to go and at an instinctive level when somebody's
[42:17.520 --> 42:21.840]  coming down on me I get back and get ready and get back in their face that's
[42:21.840 --> 42:28.880]  the only thing feels good the only thing I can do God almighty I mean can you
[42:28.880 --> 42:31.840]  imagine FBI in the hallway walking over to say we're gonna kill you and your
[42:31.840 --> 42:36.200]  wife I mean that's who runs this country and of course they do 500 billion in
[42:36.200 --> 42:40.120]  drug money you think you think drug cartels really control that it's on
[42:40.120 --> 42:45.000]  record it's the government now they've moved into child grabbing I mean what I
[42:45.000 --> 42:49.800]  mean because because 50 years ago it was just the FBI saying because the
[42:49.800 --> 42:54.320]  noser didn't exist and taking money from whores and drugs and things but then
[42:54.320 --> 42:58.440]  once the organized crime starts grabbing kids to sell as sex slaves and the rest
[42:58.440 --> 43:02.640]  of it how are they gonna blow the whistle on it because because the worst of
[43:02.640 --> 43:06.480]  the worst goes to the top and says hey you're all involved in crime now you
[43:06.480 --> 43:10.760]  all took money so now you're gonna be involved in this you see that's the
[43:10.760 --> 43:15.560]  thing about evil it's like stepping off a cliff you just fall and fall and fall
[43:15.560 --> 43:22.400]  and fall it is a bottomless pit of evil and and our whole society is just
[43:22.400 --> 43:27.600]  going over the edge and then when you sit there and tell a bank manager you
[43:27.600 --> 43:30.680]  know what I just don't like your frantic phone calls because my wife pulled some
[43:30.680 --> 43:34.440]  cash out because you forgot to ask her occupation it's a private checking
[43:34.440 --> 43:38.840]  account go fill out your little federal report we have to know for the Fed
[43:38.840 --> 43:45.160]  searches tell us her occupation I've already told you you know it's and then look
[43:45.160 --> 43:49.400]  don't don't be paranoid sir we're not spying on you oh no you're just calling
[43:49.400 --> 43:53.360]  me ups and you got to fill out a federal report on me no you you're not spying on
[43:53.360 --> 44:00.080]  me you right right again and the TSA going down people's pants including
[44:00.080 --> 44:05.480]  babies and and again it's all a psychological warfare deal we get the
[44:05.480 --> 44:08.840]  videos and photos of them groping women's breasts pulling shirts off stripping
[44:08.840 --> 44:13.720]  old ladies ripping cloths we bags off old men taking diapers off babies men
[44:13.720 --> 44:18.200]  groping small girls the TSA said we're not doing that we're not doing that
[44:18.200 --> 44:20.720]  we're not doing that we're not doing that last year and then they said okay we
[44:20.720 --> 44:24.360]  are doing it we're gonna stop doing it to children never stopped oh we're not
[44:24.360 --> 44:29.040]  strip searching old women we call it something else so it's different they
[44:29.040 --> 44:34.320]  play these little criminal games with the public that's in a general trance I
[44:34.320 --> 44:38.680]  mean if you walked up and shot somebody in the head with a 45 and said I didn't
[44:38.680 --> 44:44.520]  shoot you in the head I gave you a yellow bow I gave you a pink bow for your
[44:44.520 --> 44:49.600]  hair I crowned you with a with a little hat it's like oh well your brains are
[44:49.600 --> 44:54.120]  all over the ground there's blood spurting out but it's not a it's not a
[44:54.120 --> 45:00.920]  gunshot wound it's a pink bow and the cops pull up and you blow somebody's
[45:00.920 --> 45:04.640]  head off and you say I didn't blow their head off I pink bowed because you say
[45:04.640 --> 45:08.540]  pink bowed the cops go pink bowed pink bowed pink bowed I mean this is the
[45:08.540 --> 45:14.560]  level of ridiculous sickening mind control that I have to sit here and
[45:14.560 --> 45:20.920]  watch and deal with and go along with okay it's only gonna get worse until
[45:20.920 --> 45:25.720]  people wake up and repent and by repent I mean face what this government's
[45:25.720 --> 45:30.880]  become face how more and more you look at the cops on the news and in person
[45:30.880 --> 45:34.800]  and they're all wound up crazed out of their heads the police department's
[45:34.800 --> 45:40.480]  encourage them to take steroids I mean up I saw the Fort Worth police chief was
[45:40.480 --> 45:43.960]  in the news saying you know we publicly do it we don't care you know just roid
[45:43.960 --> 45:48.200]  raging whacked out of their brains and you pull up to these domestic check
[45:48.200 --> 45:51.880]  points now and they're all crazed and wild up pull over there we're gonna search
[45:51.880 --> 45:55.080]  you and my fourth amendment get over there and they start getting their guns
[45:55.080 --> 46:03.000]  and I mean it's just crazy it's a it's a some kind of demonic trance and people
[46:03.000 --> 46:15.040]  have got to come out of it this is all a program do you understand that if you
[46:15.040 --> 46:18.280]  really believe they're real terrorists it's all about profiling and tracking
[46:18.280 --> 46:22.080]  those certain groups old-fashioned police work of course it's not about that so of
[46:22.080 --> 46:27.440]  course it's I used to make the joke well you know more people die a year from
[46:27.440 --> 46:33.000]  champagne corks you can pull this up then even die for me struck by lightning
[46:33.000 --> 46:37.320]  pull that number up you know should we have a checkpoint around a champagne
[46:37.320 --> 46:41.600]  cork when it's about to be popped because the body's pretty fragile hits you in
[46:41.600 --> 46:45.800]  the eye I can push the eye back up into the thin part of the skull cause cause a
[46:45.800 --> 46:55.160]  subdermal hematoma or can hit the temple and do the same thing and should we have
[46:55.160 --> 46:59.760]  checkpoints all around champagne bottles got a better chance to die from a
[46:59.760 --> 47:03.280]  champagne bottle than you do from terrorist be staying I mean you know
[47:03.280 --> 47:08.200]  the drill go look at the numbers deer kill like 300 people a year last time I
[47:08.200 --> 47:11.920]  checked jump it in front of them but also a few times a year a bucks rotten
[47:11.920 --> 47:15.760]  and somebody's at a you know at a rest stop it usually is they just go ahead and
[47:15.760 --> 47:22.520]  kill you but in glory to death you know 120 pound buck will kill you you got a
[47:22.520 --> 47:26.240]  bad deer you can't ban them the idea of the government's got to keep you safe
[47:26.240 --> 47:29.720]  and I've got the reports here all over the country now they're going to what
[47:29.720 --> 47:32.920]  more than triple the number of viper teams and they're five billion funding
[47:32.920 --> 47:38.640]  and now you're going to have they're announcing checkpoints randomly you're
[47:38.640 --> 47:42.800]  driving down the road small road country road big road farm road interstate
[47:42.800 --> 47:47.240]  highway and you pull up and there's guys with dogs and machine guns searching
[47:47.240 --> 47:51.360]  your car with their eyes with crazed looks at you and your wife just getting
[47:51.360 --> 47:58.400]  off on the power trip they go and find people so-called men who like to run
[47:58.400 --> 48:04.000]  around crazed all day like there's just enemies everywhere I mean look at these
[48:04.000 --> 48:07.080]  articles that info wars.com and I'm telling you folks I'm getting the point
[48:07.080 --> 48:11.240]  where I can't handle pulling up to guys in Marine Corps drill sergeant hats and
[48:11.240 --> 48:14.840]  stuff yelling at me and my family I mean I just can't take it anymore I mean I
[48:14.840 --> 48:20.800]  know stinking knuckle dragon tyranny when I see it I mean you are the opposite
[48:20.800 --> 48:25.760]  of this country you are the opposite of freedom you are anathema to this nation
[48:25.760 --> 48:29.640]  and why do you think they're getting ready for all this because they're going
[48:29.640 --> 48:33.560]  to collapse and kill the country economically it's going to destroy the
[48:33.560 --> 48:37.760]  futures of all the idiots that work for the system as well you are literally
[48:37.760 --> 48:46.320]  sticking your arm in a blender with it set on high and again because I'm upset
[48:46.320 --> 48:51.680]  by this and I'm conscious and I'm awake I'm the bad guy because I'm offended that
[48:51.680 --> 48:55.160]  all over Texas cops will ask to search your car and we'll go in your purse and
[48:55.160 --> 49:01.960]  steal your money that's supposedly freedom TSA responsible for 9,000

[49:39.880 --> 49:44.880]  actually terrorist and it goes on to say the Viper teams under TSA did 9,000
[49:44.880 --> 49:50.120]  unannounced checkpoints including some with the Army with them now here's

[54:19.640 --> 54:26.520]  get away with this even the enforcers are unconscious to much of it too you
[54:26.520 --> 54:30.520]  know to say let's stop Al Qaeda let's randomly go to the middle of West
[54:30.520 --> 54:34.640]  Virginia or the middle of Southern California and just randomly set up a
[54:34.640 --> 54:39.240]  checkpoint on a road like you're going to find a terrorist who's going to get
[54:39.240 --> 54:44.280]  somebody and out of all these checkpoints they haven't stopped a
[54:44.280 --> 54:52.040]  quote single terrorist it's just made up it's pointed at the general public it's
[54:52.040 --> 54:56.320]  pointed at pickup list of people they want to arrest to get the general public
[54:56.320 --> 54:59.920]  and everybody acclimated to highway checkpoints and the army running your
[54:59.920 --> 55:05.200]  database today and throw in the back of an army truck and take you away and by
[55:05.200 --> 55:08.400]  the way that's now all admitted they're preparing for coordinating cities
[55:08.400 --> 55:17.040]  blockading cities door-to-door gun confiscation it's all public now and you
[55:17.040 --> 55:20.040]  notice all these years I told you they're gearing up for martial law after
[55:20.040 --> 55:23.320]  they collapse the economy through derivatives fraud they'll collapse
[55:23.320 --> 55:27.280]  Europe then Asia then the United States and you see it all happening because
[55:27.280 --> 55:36.080]  it's a plan it's a plan it's a plan again to just randomly say well we've got
[55:36.080 --> 55:42.640]  five billion dollars but now that's being massively expanded and we're going
[55:42.640 --> 55:48.800]  to have 25 more Viper teams scattered across the country responsible for
[55:48.800 --> 55:52.840]  manning checkpoints on highways in bus and train terminals and sporting events
[55:52.840 --> 56:00.120]  and even high school prom nights the LA Times reports again why do they have
[56:00.120 --> 56:03.320]  National Guard for a decade just it even high school football games searching
[56:03.320 --> 56:09.040]  people it's to acclimate you and the military and police to accept a take
[56:09.040 --> 56:14.640]  over and now they admit will kill citizens will arrest citizens will send
[56:14.640 --> 56:18.320]  the military after you and you get the training manuals it's about
[56:18.320 --> 56:23.520]  conservatives libertarians Ron Paul supporters in the Fedders Alex Jones
[56:23.520 --> 56:30.360]  filmmakers I mean they've had the army in plain clothes come out to my rallies
[56:30.360 --> 56:33.760]  before we were sent the documents from patriots inside the Pentagon and
[56:33.760 --> 56:39.000]  published it and in the manual it says down in Houston don't let Ron Paul and
[56:39.000 --> 56:44.080]  his rally know your military they may kill you actually says they may attack
[56:44.080 --> 56:47.920]  and when you go to the end the Fed and Dallas and others and that was when we
[56:47.920 --> 56:51.400]  read don't don't don't let them know your military and plain clothes
[56:51.400 --> 56:55.520]  surveilling them because they may attack and imagine with a straight face
[56:55.520 --> 57:01.120]  Ron Paul may attack okay so oh my god these people say there's foreign banks
[57:01.120 --> 57:05.400]  running us there they're terrorists look at no no we're the real Americans that
[57:05.400 --> 57:09.720]  did the research we know how to save the country we know where we're going we
[57:09.720 --> 57:17.360]  know how to turn it around we're the good guys that say it's not good to have
[57:17.360 --> 57:23.160]  random federal checkpoints it's not good to have TSA sticking their hands down
[57:23.160 --> 57:28.320]  your daughter's pants it's not good to be put in radiation machines it's not
[57:28.320 --> 57:32.120]  good to have acid for but your seizure and police taking money out of people's
[57:32.120 --> 57:36.160]  purses and wallets when no drugs are found
[57:36.160 --> 57:48.520]  oh oh it is so crazy again it totally freaked me out last night it really hit
[57:48.520 --> 57:54.040]  me hard again it really hit me hard hearing about the all these cops I've
[57:54.040 --> 57:57.240]  talked to and the police I've talked to the investigative the murder of other
[57:57.240 --> 58:01.200]  police around Oklahoma City and FBI walking right up the cops and saying
[58:01.200 --> 58:06.600]  we'll kill your daughter we'll kill your wife will kill you I mean witness after
[58:06.600 --> 58:10.080]  witness I've talked to on-air and off air over the years and it's just so real
[58:10.080 --> 58:19.240]  so sick so evil and they're just building this giant army of thugs and scum and I
[58:19.240 --> 58:22.080]  guess a lot of these people work for the system they just like it they know
[58:22.080 --> 58:26.080]  they're evil they don't even care of their if their own financial futures
[58:26.080 --> 58:30.720]  ruined as long as they can have some fun and I think that's what it comes down to

[59:05.920 --> 59:09.880]  possible that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science

[01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:10.800]  makes me actually become flummoxed when I think about this and really accept and
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:19.520]  grieve it's in between crying and and and and getting dizzy I know why people
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:25.240]  faint sometimes it's just it's it's the realization look look you can't just go
[01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:28.480]  through life while a bunch of psycho demons that are kidnapping kids and

[01:01:51.640 --> 01:02:01.560]  blood-wallowing biological Android ticks giant 200 pound self-mobile ticks
[01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:06.720]  that blend in with us and are all around us and spiritually they are tuned in to
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:13.280]  hell itself and I can I can pick up on them I've got their total mindset their
[01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:20.360]  wavelength down and I just man I'm like God my discernment just gets more and
[01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:24.680]  more intense by the day I just start asking I mean how I mean I just I can't
[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:28.280]  even look at these people anymore it's not even hatred or disgust anymore it's
[01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:33.720]  just it's just like ugh ugh and then I don't even have the capacity to fear
[01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:38.520]  them 15 16 years ago I get a death rattle but scared I can't even worry
[01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:44.000]  about defending myself I can't even be scared any time I have no it's like I'm
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:51.360]  losing my basic humanity I don't even know how to describe it I just I just do
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:03:02.480]  not like being around these people all right let's just go ahead and go to some
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:05.440]  of your phone calls I'll get it all the other news we got a bunch of guests
[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:11.200]  coming up today Robert and Washington you're on the air go ahead hey Alex
[01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:14.640]  Merry Christmas hey congratulations and winning those Liberty Awards you and
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:19.200]  your crew you know the fine work you did as a filmmaker for the last 17 years we
[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:22.960]  know you're not in it for the money like some people like the traders over at the
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:27.360]  IRN and I talked a couple times on Dr. Stan and I brought up the Beyond
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:31.000]  Treason and I understand the reasons about that but every family should
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:35.600]  watch Beyond Treason have young people learn to watch or get that video online
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:41.160]  Beyond Treason another quick point I have to bring Ron Paul ideas for it of
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:46.840]  course remember the Obama Joker flyer what if we had an Obama or excuse me and
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:51.240]  the Ron Paul wins the presidency or so many little different issues we could
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:55.240]  do hypothetical ones in the future Ron Paul can win every activist hand these
[01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:58.480]  people out because I go to a pub sometime and I tell the guy about Ron Paul
[01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:02.520]  he says who is he one of the main ones I says he's the only one you know you know
[01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:05.960]  the four ideas are so ignorant but what well now you got two different crowds you
[01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:09.440]  got those of us that are awake and getting more awakened and more and more
[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:14.760]  informed and you got those that just watch mainstream TV who literally have no
[01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:19.640]  idea what planet they're on but what about that Alex is that a dumb idea it's
[01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:23.040]  not like trying to boycott the gas station once year I think it may have
[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:27.240]  value if everybody would take these Ron Paul things like Ron Paul wins the
[01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:31.200]  presidency we've like you know it's in the time work in the future where Ron
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:35.720]  Paul see people know exactly that's how you counter their thing of ignoring
[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:39.520]  Ron Paul are saying you can't win as you say Ron Paul has won the presidency
[01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:43.520]  that's a great way we can even do an article about that explain how it's
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:48.400]  counter propaganda against them in the next paragraph show how it's the opposite
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:51.720]  of the mind game they're playing and kind of show people the trick that way
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:56.840]  great point as for the money thing it is good for us to actually be strong we
[01:04:56.840 --> 01:05:03.520]  will defend ourselves you've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs
[01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:07.160]  generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal
[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:11.240]  silver solutions yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs
[01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:14.720]  system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere

[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:27.920]  colloidal and ionic silver solutions it also comes equipped with the proper
[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:32.360]  applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:39.600]  key target areas this includes the eyes ears nose lungs topically to the skin

[01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:18.280]  it's been said that I work too much and I really do yeah I do the nightly news
[01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:22.040]  most nights or one of the other reporters does the radio show of all
[01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:25.160]  these interviews we're gonna be here this Sunday with a special Christmas
[01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:29.680]  transmission and I tend to get negative and angry I know there's a lot of good
[01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:33.640]  people at every level of society in America is in a lot of trouble but we're
[01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:38.360]  still the best nation on earth I've been a lot of other countries it's just
[01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:43.800]  painful to see this this globalist artificial culture being forced into
[01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:51.120]  every society and to just see corruption rising and to see people sold on
[01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:55.120]  thinking you can't fight it in my experience when you fight corruption it
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:09:01.320]  parts like the Red Sea in your own little area but you've got to fight it
[01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:08.760]  you've got to stand up to it you've got to walk on faith I mean you've got to
[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:14.520]  step forward you've got to say no you got to say hey threaten to kill me all
[01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:19.800]  you wonder do whatever it is I'm not gonna live in fear and that takes the
[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:25.800]  power away from the enemy now I should be calm I should just steadfastly face
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:32.000]  this but I am an angry person I can't help it folks I've always hated bullies
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:38.160]  I've always hated people that hurt little animals I've all I'm big softy but in
[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:46.280]  that I am an extremely aggressive person and it is it is just it is torture it is
[01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:50.880]  torture when the families call me every day with their kids being taken and then
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:55.160]  I found out it's it's it's nine course subsidiaries who run open child kidnapping
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:58.480]  operations worldwide and it's even in the mainstream news and they're running
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:04.600]  the CPS local and I know they're a bunch of pervs and I just it it's horrible to
[01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:08.440]  see the crime continue and I guess for the rest of the yuppies and everybody
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:11.960]  they just go out and have fun and party and if something happens to them their
[01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:18.800]  friends don't care about them it's all fake it's all real shallow it's not real
[01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:22.720]  and most these people aren't real friends they don't really come through it's
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:29.920]  it's like delusional it's it's not I'm gonna go to your calls it's just it I
[01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:37.160]  don't even want to say it shook me up yesterday but I have passed almost
[01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:42.720]  emotional or or awakening periods in my life I realized like a spiritual
[01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:47.120]  threshold and previously I'd cross them every two or three years and would have
[01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:52.800]  like this big come-to-Jesus moment it could really feel it and unconsciously
[01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:58.360]  see the area I'm going into and the responsibilities and then last night God
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:02.240]  just showed me so much and I couldn't even talk and I do not even feel worthy
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:07.280]  to be here bringing you this information and I it just absolutely brought me to a
[01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:12.720]  place I've never been to your God just really says you want to see the evil
[01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:33.400]  here it is feel it and to feel what the children are feeling God oh my we got it
[01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:50.640]  we gotta get good people to stand up against these people I probably shouldn't
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:55.000]  even have done this radio show today because I have this disgusted cover for
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:59.240]  how I just hate the globalist but it's more than that and I can I just get
[01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:03.160]  flippant and angry but it's because deep down folks I can see what they're
[01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:07.960]  doing and I have we have a responsibility to stop these globalist
[01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:13.000]  where are the men in this country where are the men in this world what the hell
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:18.640]  if we become we just offer our children up to the system with the fluoride the
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:23.040]  water and the GMO hurting them and we let fat perverts grab them at the airport
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:26.880]  to train them for the pedophile government and we've just got such a
[01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:36.040]  sick society you know I I don't even want to go to calls and everybody go
[01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:40.840]  Alex it's alright and I don't even this is quite the spectacle I'll just tell
[01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:44.520]  you this folks if you're not upset yet like the bumper sticker says you're not
[01:12:44.520 --> 01:13:02.400]  paying attention I agree for this country's gonna go this country's gonna
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:07.800]  be destroyed the globalist if they have their way are gonna kill millions of
[01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:11.240]  people they're gonna run the same type of stuff they did in the Soviet Russia
[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:14.440]  when they broke all the Christian farmers and killed them and starved them
[01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:17.760]  and stuff what they're setting up I see the attack profile we got all the
[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:23.360]  documents and because we're a decadent nation who's been beguiled and put into
[01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:28.240]  a trance go ahead and get the interview with fine I'm gonna air that now then
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:35.960]  I'll go to my guest later it is unspeakably bad what's gonna happen but
[01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:40.400]  it's it's it's the law of the universe if we stand by and let third-world people
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:44.320]  be killed and think it's funny and make jokes about it and think it's sexy to
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:47.800]  torture people and sexy to have no rights or due process and all these
[01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:53.080]  soft cowardly domesticated people who are just victims of their own you know
[01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:56.640]  culture sit there and go well I have nothing to hide so what if they can
[01:13:56.640 --> 01:14:03.720]  secretly arrest me they it is unspeakable where we're gonna go
[01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:12.280]  and cut off my intro do we have a right up to fine yeah this is from the
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:15.240]  nightly news last night we'll play this in this segment got a break a little bit
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:18.760]  more of it it's like 30 minutes long it's up at prison planet TV and it's on
[01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:22.800]  the YouTube channel for everybody you know I want to come here on the air and
[01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:26.960]  give you a heartfelt true deep analysis and what happens is I read all these
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:30.240]  hundreds of news articles and have all this information and then just get so
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:33.680]  angry by the time I get on air that most of time I can't even get to much of it
[01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:39.920]  because it's so much crazier than I can even say and we're so accustomed to
[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:44.480]  putting up with evil now and I just see men and women who've been made weak and
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:50.480]  and rendered broke back and I just and then the evil just runs wild does
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:54.720]  whatever it wants who will stand up against the wicked ones who will stand
[01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:58.560]  up for the children who will stand up for the innocence in the widows who where
[01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:04.400]  are you what is wrong with you as men out there as police to hear how almost the
[01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:08.360]  entire Oklahoma City Department knows the government the feds blew it up and
[01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:18.960]  they're all scared what in earth as we've turned into a demonic country a
[01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:24.680]  demonic world and if you think things are bad now we're going over the edge
[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:33.200]  into the abyss right now and all of you trying to take care of yourselves all
[01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:37.280]  of you only worried about your ego and how you look and what's going on who
[01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:41.200]  afraid what your neighbors say don't you get when everybody goes along with the
[01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:44.720]  evil thinking they'll be left alone that's what lets the evil take over
[01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:51.400]  don't you understand that let's go to Ron Paul's chief policy advisor
[01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:55.160]  constitutional lawyer Bruce fine here it is that Bruce thanks for joining us from
[01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:59.800]  DC what should we get into first the giant police state power grab or Ron
[01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:04.200]  Paul's counter to it well I think we should get into the power grab first
[01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:07.800]  because that really transcends any individual candidate it's something that's
[01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:12.200]  going to come to haunt the United States not only today but in the future if we
[01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:17.160]  survive as a genuine sovereignty that celebrates the Republic and not only do
[01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:21.600]  we have this national defense authorization act that Ron Paul condemned
[01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:26.160]  that crowns the military with authority to detain any of us for life in the
[01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:31.360]  United States if the president says we're substantially aiding an associated
[01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:37.480]  force of the Taliban to attack coalition forces a totally open-ended standard
[01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:42.760]  that now makes all of our liberties at the whim of the president and then we
[01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:47.600]  have this continuity in government revelation that we discussed earlier and
[01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:53.000]  that suspends democracy suspends the Republic in the event of some so-called
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:57.480]  emergency that the president declares or whatever standard of emergency is and
[01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:03.240]  basically pits the government against the people instead of that's an inversion
[01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:07.720]  of what the Constitution is about which says we the people are sovereign not the
[01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:11.840]  government the government is the steward of our liberties not the grantor of our
[01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:17.000]  liberties that are unalienable and we also know from stories recently that
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.920]  we have surveillance drones on the Southwest border the government
[01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:25.880]  claiming they can surveil us from the day we step out the moment we step out
[01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:30.720]  of our house until we we go back into our bedroom without any probable cause
[01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:35.520]  without any warrants that's what's being made as a claim in the United States
[01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:40.400]  Supreme Court we're using predator drones to kill people based upon secret
[01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:43.880]  evidence and secret law that the president says he can't disclose there's
[01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:47.280]  no post-mortem there's no way to hold anyone accountable for these
[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:53.440]  assassinations that remind me of of the gulag archipelago archipelago of
[01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:57.920]  sultan it's in you know during the soviet days and it never ends always more
[01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:01.480]  encroachment on liberty always more encroachment on privacy and that this
[01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:06.600]  this feudal quest for so-called absolute risk-free existence which is a
[01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:10.920]  guarantee of simply detaining and arresting everyone on the theory that
[01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:15.760]  we're not all saints a truly horrifying I think development in the the
[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:19.840]  incredible thing is there so little resistance Ron Paul ran Paul voted
[01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:24.240]  against these kinds of bills in the Senate but it's really a handful overall
[01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:30.920]  only 13 senators out of 100 opposed this tyrannical rule Ron Paul himself I
[01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:36.000]  think as is the one person standing as a beacon there recognizing and willing
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:40.880]  like all the other candidates to argue against this police state and that makes
[01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:44.880]  a safety as opposed to liberty and freedom they are the touchstone of the
[01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:48.720]  country even though that the safety really is an illusion because when you
[01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:54.240]  create a belief that all citizens are disloyal it'll create cynicism and a
[01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:57.760]  sense that the government then becomes illegitimate and the greatest strength
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:19:01.800]  any country has is the allegiance and loyalty of its people that's the greatest
[01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:06.000]  strength and not not the weapons no that was my things of that sort certainly I
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:09.160]  mean I mean in the last few decades the military industrial complex the big
[01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:13.640]  crony capitalists non-free market mega banks they've tried to keep the velvet
[01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:16.920]  glove on the iron fist but now because Congress for now what two years is at a
[01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:20.600]  nine percent approval rating even liberals big government people say they
[01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:24.680]  fear big government more than you know the free market and corporations now so
[01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:29.160]  there is an awakening so I think the system is just dispensing with even the
[01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:33.440]  ceremony now I mean we were talking about this before we went live here this
[01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:37.200]  is from the White House website two weeks ago strategic implementation for
[01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:41.560]  plan for empowering local partners to prevent violent extremism in the United
[01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:45.240]  States and it's a federal announcement saying domestic terrorist number one
[01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:49.120]  threat and speech criticizing the government there's bizarre quotes in
[01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:54.640]  here is is is aiding terror and there's a president Obama we're gonna go to break
[01:19:54.640 --> 01:20:00.240]  where he's and come back with Bruce Fine's answer on the other end stay with

[01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:09.640]  these are hard times for investors you don't know which way to go is the market
[01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:13.440]  going to recover is the Washington spending machine going to continue and
[01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:17.280]  that means a lot of debt and maybe printing money to cover the debt they
[01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:22.000]  call it monetizing the debt but that's a fancy way of saying inflation and a lot
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:25.360]  of people are worried about that so you need the ultimate inflation hedge and
[01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:29.440]  that's gold now let me be clear about this commodities fluctuate in price
[01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:34.240]  they can go up and down very volatile there's no guarantee but if you want the

[01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:56.480]  Ron Paul wears Hitler underwear and is evil because he comes on this show oh
[01:24:56.480 --> 01:25:02.840]  yeah hundreds of articles a day Ron Paul's gone up in the polls and so they're
[01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:08.400]  asking the question Ron Paul the new Teflon candidate and that's what they're
[01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:11.520]  gonna do ladies and gentlemen they're gonna just keep throwing mud and made
[01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:18.800]  up garbage and exaggerated and twisted news because they can't beat him in
[01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:23.000]  Iowa because it's an actual real voting system where it's done by hand votes
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:27.160]  then tally in front everybody now when he hits black box New Hampshire that's
[01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:32.560]  gonna be a different story but imagine all of Ron Paul's patriotic anti-neural
[01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:38.240]  order information is now front and center resistance is victory here's some
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:42.040]  more the Bruce Fine interview we'll get to more of it too towards the end of the
[01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:45.800]  next hour after Bob Chapman's on with a little other guest coming up right now
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:49.800]  here it is it shows that the Constitution has been vandalized by the
[01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:54.520]  government and they the government needs to be held accountable and it turns
[01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:58.880]  they say the idea of the republic on its head the glory of republic is liberty
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:03.360]  the individual is the center of our constitutional solar system in an empire
[01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:08.160]  what we've got today big government encroaching on all of our liberties is the
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:12.720]  earmark and dominion and domination is the so-called glory of an empire so
[01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:17.040]  then we we're so far away from the Constitution as it was drafted and
[01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:22.040]  understood and celebrated 220 years ago that we might as well be King George
[01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:26.600]  III the president of the United States at present enjoys more authority than
[01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:32.600]  King George who we overthrew because of his tyrannical powers in 1776 that is
[01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:39.120]  where we are the Constitution has been so defaced it's it's been so warped to
[01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:44.000]  just empower the government to encroach and stamp and destroy our liberties and
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:50.240]  now when they're suggesting freedom of speech the freedom to criticize the
[01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:55.240]  government which should be welcome since the government airs so often they need
[01:26:55.240 --> 01:27:00.480]  instruction rather than echo chambers is now being made suspect and indeed we
[01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:04.400]  had the situation when the Patriot Act was passed shortly after 9-11 where the
[01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:08.120]  data attorney general said anybody who criticized the Patriot Act was aiding in
[01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:13.440]  embedding the enemy you know it's it's it's this delusion that causes the
[01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:17.960]  president Obama to say he doesn't understand why people in Afghanistan or
[01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:21.360]  Pakistan are trying to kill our soldiers just because we're trying to shoot
[01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:25.120]  them you know maybe it's because if we stop shooting them then they wouldn't be
[01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:29.360]  protesting with violence and maybe if the government obey the Constitution they
[01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:32.800]  wouldn't get the extreme speech and I don't want to suggest that we're at the
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:37.960]  the precipice of justifying you know violent revolution but we never should
[01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:41.840]  forget that in that declaration of independence that Thomas Jefferson wrote
[01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:46.920]  in all of our founding fathers subscribe to it says when a government evinces a
[01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:52.280]  consistent train of action that displays an intent to reduce us to vassals
[01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:57.120]  there's not only a right a duty to change and overthrow the government and to
[01:27:57.120 --> 01:28:01.080]  supply a new dispensation that will protect our liberties and the
[01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:06.560]  government's got to recognize you cannot continue to try to oppress all of our
[01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:11.960]  opportunities to speak and argue and to display total and complete opposition to
[01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:16.320]  what we think our vandalizations of our constitutional rights and expect to
[01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:20.560]  retain power one of the things that I think is most unfortunate because of
[01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:25.480]  the historical ways in which it was some respects was discredited we need to go
[01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:28.480]  to the impeachment power you know Congress needs to stand up to the plate
[01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:31.320]  the members could be impeached themselves if they're not honoring
[01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:35.600]  Constitution and any president of the United States who says that he can use
[01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:39.960]  the military to arrest us because he says that he suspects we're substantially
[01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:44.320]  aiding now al-Qaeda or Taliban we don't have a right to do rebut it there's no
[01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:49.040]  trial there's no accusation we just get to rot yeah why would Congress not stay
[01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:53.840]  why I mean there's several questions here but it's all intriguing and is the
[01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:58.480]  big issue of the day why would the Congress try to give the president the
[01:28:58.480 --> 01:29:02.000]  power of a dictator but before you go there Ron Paul the Congress for the
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:07.580]  presidential candidate was on my radio show last Tuesday and the video of its
[01:29:07.580 --> 01:29:10.600]  gone around the web has been seen millions of times is its radio slash
[01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:18.200]  TV and he said but basically what you've said but but but he said the NDAA the
[01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:22.840]  National Defense Authorization Act establishes martial law in this country
[01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:26.320]  and that's what Jonathan Turley said that's what basically we've said and
[01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:30.360]  literally more than 200 if you go to Google News and type in Ron Paul Alex
[01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:37.240]  Jones from that interview more than 200 newspapers CBS ABC TV basically said
[01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:41.880]  Ron Paul's an extremist and dangerous and groups said that's why he's being
[01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:45.640]  kicked out of the upcoming debate we'll be right back folks stay with us we have
[01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:51.480]  a special guest straight ahead it's Friday edition we're on the March the

[01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:18.680]  caring to get me down but I should be very positive these type of struggles
[01:33:18.680 --> 01:33:24.080]  that separate the mice from men and they give people a chance to decide what
[01:33:24.080 --> 01:33:28.600]  they're gonna serve good or evil it really is a fight between good and evil
[01:33:28.600 --> 01:33:32.200]  as my guest said the other night when I had him on the TV show Joe Joseph we're
[01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:36.960]  going to him he works for the Department of Defense in the highly classified
[01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:40.760]  areas we'll just leave it at that as a high-level national security clearance
[01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:46.680]  but he pointed out stuff that was was marked sensitive but was public on DOD
[01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:51.920]  bid sites and about an hour after we went live where that they jerked it down
[01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:56.280]  but we'd saved it by then and it deals with the plan for the Red Force versus
[01:33:56.280 --> 01:34:00.000]  the rest the public military manning the camps taking over every facet of
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:06.200]  society it couldn't be a bigger piece of news in some of the other news there's
[01:34:06.200 --> 01:34:10.760]  an article out today it's up at info wars comm also drudge report dot com TSA
[01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:15.440]  does additional screening for holiday cakes sometimes they just take the whole
[01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:20.160]  cake and eat other times just cut a slice out other times they deem cupcakes
[01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:26.720]  security threats and eat them I guess got all of that craziness going also the
[01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:30.560]  head of the IMF urges member states to boost funding including the United
[01:34:30.560 --> 01:34:36.040]  States is giving him money elder Bush has endorsed the globalist Mitt Romney
[01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:41.200]  mr. carbon tax mr. open border mr. abortion so of course mr. Rockefeller
[01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:45.280]  Republican endorsed him and the Republican establishment is decrying Ron Paul
[01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:50.560]  because he's an actual libertarian constitutionalist classical conservative
[01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:57.000]  we've got all of that going on and in more TSA news I mentioned this but it's
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:02.520]  big Congress has funded massive expansion of TSA checkpoints all over the
[01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:08.200]  country complete with MP5 submachine guns dogs everything and they they say
[01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:11.800]  they're just gonna randomly search you everywhere I mean it's you want to live
[01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:16.680]  under a federal dictatorship well they're happy to do it for you why is
[01:35:16.680 --> 01:35:21.440]  all this coming because you think the economy's bad now the new order plan is
[01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:26.080]  to destroy the economy now the big report out here that they got studies
[01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:29.960]  showing that Americans are scared to fly thanks to TSA yeah I've talked to bus
[01:35:29.960 --> 01:35:33.840]  drivers and looked up the numbers there's more than double the buses being used
[01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:36.720]  in their word just 10 years ago I mean you drive around the interstate highway
[01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:40.720]  there's just buses everywhere and feds are like you think you're gonna get away
[01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:45.280]  that way we're gonna rope your family there and I've got articles now where
[01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:48.080]  there's more knocking talks where the feds are with the police sometimes
[01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:52.160]  military and they say we're here to look at your guns and they just shove their
[01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:56.040]  way right in the house in places like Boston pull it up all that can't happen
[01:35:56.040 --> 01:36:02.360]  in America oh really oh really Pentagon gets to go ahead for offensive cyber
[01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:08.200]  wars in the NDAA here's that article out of the Associated Press dessert
[01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:15.480]  toting traveler thinks TSA takes the cake and it goes over all of that here's
[01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:18.200]  another one we won't have time to play this clip but it's up at info wars.com
[01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:21.880]  from CNN Congresswoman TSA screeners should stop
[01:36:21.880 --> 01:36:25.960]  impersonating federal law enforcement officers they've got a new piece
[01:36:25.960 --> 01:36:32.520]  legislation called strip that's the thing a federal marshal or even the
[01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:38.120]  out-of-control FBI can't go to a park and say you might be a terrorist prior
[01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:43.920]  constraint guilty until proven slave I'm gonna touch your pants on the outside
[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:48.000]  that's that's sexual assault I'm gonna go in your pants that's aggravated
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:54.360]  assault but TSA I've had a US agents tell me I'm gonna go in your pants now and I
[01:36:54.360 --> 01:36:58.680]  told the guy okay go ahead I'm gonna sue you so he didn't but he just kind of
[01:36:58.680 --> 01:37:06.400]  patted around and but plus I want to see what they do and he said it's my
[01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:11.720]  administrative privilege and I've had a background check well my goodness see
[01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:16.480]  we're all guilty we're all criminals we're all scum but the government they're
[01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:22.800]  good and then you've got them going crazy raping people robbing stealing every
[01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:27.480]  form of craziness hitting on women laughing at their naked body skins lying
[01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:30.860]  about the fact that they save the images that got confirmed lying about the
[01:37:30.860 --> 01:37:36.000]  radiation level lying about stripping old ladies it's a culture of total
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:40.320]  lying and then this is maker to break it they want to break our will but you
[01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:44.840]  notice they're groping is waking everybody up so this is the one of the
[01:37:44.840 --> 01:37:48.880]  big unifying issues for liberals conservatives you name it where people
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:52.360]  understand that this is not a good direction that our country is going in
[01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:56.200]  it's also a giant federal power grab so we've got those reports we're going to
[01:37:56.200 --> 01:38:00.560]  our guests here in just a moment continuing a Bachman campaign lies about
[01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:07.840]  Iowa says that she's tied with Ron Paul even though she's got 2.77% and Ron
[01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:12.600]  Paul's as high as 30 in some of the polls and rising under attack see again
[01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:17.880]  that shows the so-called mainstream media isn't the agenda setters but they got
[01:38:17.880 --> 01:38:22.360]  the black boxes though they'll be fraud later don't worry continuing Paul's
[01:38:22.360 --> 01:38:26.400]  position play well and I have a Wall Street Journal against CBS News says
[01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:35.320]  he's Teflon and it goes on and on from that point let's go ahead and go to our
[01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:39.480]  guest if you just joined us Joe Joseph was on with us for about 30 minutes the
[01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:45.280]  other night on the nightly TV show info works nightly news seven o'clock and it
[01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:48.200]  was he and his wife kept sending us emails saying look at this Department
[01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:52.440]  of Defense contract look at that one this is all public stuff but about an hour
[01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:56.400]  after our article went up we did our interview with him at info wars comm
[01:38:56.400 --> 01:39:01.440]  Wednesday night it was taken down that the documents about the military to run
[01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:05.240]  and North com to run the continuity government collapse in the FEMA camps
[01:39:05.240 --> 01:39:11.120]  and the blue force versus the public they pulled it and put a message up that
[01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:16.080]  we've gotten a subsequent article saying Department of Defense employees
[01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:21.240]  you're not supposed to upload classified material or even sensitive so I guess
[01:39:21.240 --> 01:39:25.560]  the message is and I haven't talked to Joseph since then so Joseph what do you
[01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:28.960]  make of this have you had repercussions because as you pointed out you
[01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:31.960]  didn't talk about any classified stuff you know not about the things you're
[01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:36.280]  involved in you as a citizen are allowed to contact to talk radio person
[01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:41.000]  say hey do you see this public thing and and and write down how sub how
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:45.280]  important it was and it is big news obviously and they pulled it what do you
[01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:50.320]  make of that and what's happened since we talked to you 36 hours ago or so no
[01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:54.400]  Alex it all comes down to accountability and that's the only thing that I'm
[01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:58.920]  trying to achieve here is to hold these people to account for taking away our
[01:39:58.920 --> 01:40:02.920]  liberties and freedoms I mean this is this is ridiculous stuff and I want to
[01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:07.120]  I want to point out yet they pulled it I have no idea why they pulled it it's an
[01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:12.640]  open source document and if you go through FBO.gov which is a free open
[01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:17.520]  source website that the public can go on much like the CBO you can go to the CBO
[01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:20.800]  Congressional Budget Office and go look at all the congressional numbers all
[01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:24.880]  this stuff is open to the public so it's it was a bit troubling to me to see that
[01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:28.840]  they pulled it down and now you brought up source selection sensitive which is on
[01:40:28.840 --> 01:40:36.640]  the document and then next to it it's FAR 3.104 if you look up FAR 3.104 that
[01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:41.880]  has to do with procurement integrity all that says is there's guidelines that you
[01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:47.800]  have to follow as a contracting entity within the federal government to
[01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:54.840]  properly put this contract out for bid probably because it's umpteen million
[01:40:54.840 --> 01:40:58.120]  dollar contract and I don't even know how much it is oh this thing's got to be
[01:40:58.120 --> 01:41:01.600]  in the tens of billions how gargantuan it is well I don't yeah see I don't know
[01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:05.320]  I'm not privy to that kind of information but I'll tell you how I stumbled
[01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:09.600]  upon this and and where it really got me is when you were you were talking about
[01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:17.220]  the KBR and the the reactivation of FEMA camps and my wife came to me and said
[01:41:17.220 --> 01:41:20.220]  you know well this is what Alex is talking about and he's got some inside
[01:41:20.220 --> 01:41:26.400]  documents from KBR and I says well you know sometimes getting that kind of
[01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:30.680]  stuff from a contractor's little shoddy but anytime a contract's been awarded
[01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:35.440]  there has to be a solicitation notice so let me go look for the solicitation
[01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:39.560]  notice now I didn't originally find the solicitation notice for KBR because
[01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:43.160]  the first thing that popped up when I searched Department of Homeland Security
[01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:49.400]  was this and I was like holy smokes man this is crazy and it's first you know
[01:41:49.400 --> 01:41:53.600]  it's it's important for the government to have a continuity of government planned
[01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:58.760]  much as it's it's important for all of us to have a plan to fall back on like
[01:41:58.760 --> 01:42:03.360]  for this isn't like of a meteorite head so there's a 12.5 earthquake that splits
[01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:06.680]  the country into like it's happened before the Mississippi River but but no
[01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:10.200]  this as you explained it's right there this is a battle playing against the
[01:42:10.200 --> 01:42:14.840]  people and a total takeover and a suspension of the system just as PDD
[01:42:14.840 --> 01:42:20.320]  51 that Bush signed Obama continued says Congress is suspended for any reason
[01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:24.680]  including economic well the document in and of itself is only one piece of the
[01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:29.120]  puzzle but it's interesting how they put the entire puzzle out in about one
[01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:34.360]  month's time and it's one sentence in the original document that is that makes
[01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:39.520]  it that puts it all together and it says additional efforts of operations
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:42.880]  division includes geospatial information system which is like a
[01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:46.920]  battlefield awareness type of thing blue force situational awareness that's how
[01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:51.120]  you identify friendlies and command control communications and computer
[01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:56.400]  these are all warfare terms so my question is why for a continuity of
[01:42:56.400 --> 01:43:00.360]  government operation are we using battlefield terminology on our own
[01:43:00.360 --> 01:43:07.280]  soil and then if you tie that in with s1867 s1867 makes America a battlefield
[01:43:07.280 --> 01:43:13.480]  oh well now we know why that language is in there it's because they go hand in
[01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:16.600]  hand with one another but when I met the Marine Corps drills that are on tape
[01:43:16.600 --> 01:43:21.040]  they had 12 years ago red versus blue and the militias they were practicing
[01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:26.040]  fighting in America in the drills we have it all on tape the Marines of the
[01:43:26.040 --> 01:43:30.960]  blue force fighting the red force absolutely right so I mean it's it's
[01:43:30.960 --> 01:43:35.120]  troubling it's extremely troubling but it's certainly nothing for people to
[01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:40.000]  fear and that's that's the one thing that I want to put I do this out of a
[01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:44.940]  sense of duty one of my heroes is Martin Luther King and he once said you know
[01:43:44.940 --> 01:43:48.880]  cowardice asked the question is it safe expediency asked the question is it
[01:43:48.880 --> 01:43:53.280]  politic vanity asked the question is it popular but conscience asked the
[01:43:53.280 --> 01:43:57.600]  question is it right and there comes a time when one must take a position that
[01:43:57.600 --> 01:44:02.640]  is neither safe nor politic nor popular but he must do it because
[01:44:02.640 --> 01:44:09.000]  conscience tells him it is right and we cannot be silent in these days folks is
[01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:13.840]  this is the time to stand up I know one of the prevailing thoughts when you
[01:44:13.840 --> 01:44:18.160]  start diving down the rabbit hole is you start to feel alone because anytime you
[01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:22.440]  try to approach co-workers and I know you had active-duty military and police
[01:44:22.440 --> 01:44:26.960]  calling in and they talk about just how hard it is to to try and awaken their
[01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:32.660]  co-workers and the you have to make them feel like they're not alone 2006 New
[01:44:32.660 --> 01:44:37.920]  York Times poll came out where 81% thought that there was something
[01:44:37.920 --> 01:44:43.800]  hokey about 9-11 but do you hear that kind of of people speaking out about
[01:44:43.800 --> 01:44:48.240]  it no because when they go to their moms or their dads or their their family
[01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:51.720]  members or their co-workers they get looked like they got three heads on
[01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:55.560]  their shoulders and so they'd be quiet you know they'd be quiet some down
[01:44:55.560 --> 01:44:58.080]  because they don't want to feel like a freak they care what other people think
[01:44:58.080 --> 01:45:02.880]  and then this is my issue I've reached the point now even more than before it's
[01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:06.600]  not abnormal that I'm jealous of my liberty that those are those are hard
[01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:12.200]  fought and hard won and and we need to be aggressive with people when they try
[01:45:12.200 --> 01:45:16.880]  to stomp on us because the system is openly trying to break our will and
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:21.560]  train us to be prisoners I mean this is a conscious program you had probably one
[01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:26.000]  of the best interviews last night that I've heard in a long time and that was
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:32.280]  with Bruce Fine and he laid it all out for people as far as what is truly going
[01:45:32.280 --> 01:45:36.520]  on I mean this is Empire if you look back through history this is what
[01:45:36.520 --> 01:45:42.680]  empires do this is nothing new this is just the latest version of Empire so
[01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:47.120]  it's he talked about how they want to shut any competition down any power
[01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:51.880]  source whether it's a big church that even serves them gun owners factories
[01:45:51.880 --> 01:45:57.080]  the empires always seek to shut everything down as a control freak
[01:45:57.080 --> 01:46:02.760]  measure as an instinct towards domination absolutely right you know the
[01:46:02.760 --> 01:46:07.040]  American people have shown great restraint through all this and you know
[01:46:07.040 --> 01:46:12.320]  the question that I always have is what are the elitist and special interest
[01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:17.200]  trying to achieve by this JFK said at best those who make peaceful result
[01:46:17.200 --> 01:46:21.560]  revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable what are they
[01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:26.160]  trying to do they want a violent revolution it's it's unbelievable and
[01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:32.360]  just so everybody knows to s1867 or the NDA has not been signed by President
[01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:39.920]  Obama yet so call the White House you know 202 456 1111 call the White House
[01:46:39.920 --> 01:46:45.280]  tell them don't sign the bill you know flood them with with with phone calls
[01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:48.520]  now since you came on here they pulled the document but it but nobody's talked
[01:46:48.520 --> 01:46:53.440]  to you at at the Department of Defense now no everything that everything that
[01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:56.840]  we're talking about here Alex no I like the fact that you're bold and out in
[01:46:56.840 --> 01:47:00.320]  the open because you know this system it's like a mind-controlled police and
[01:47:00.320 --> 01:47:04.440]  bureaucrats they act like you're guilty and when you like break the trance and
[01:47:04.440 --> 01:47:08.920]  go hey buddy I'm not a criminal stop acting like that this is America they'll
[01:47:08.920 --> 01:47:12.040]  seem to kind of shake their head I mean it's like they've got them in like a
[01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:17.960]  routine or something one thing Mr. Fine pointed out yesterday was that people
[01:47:17.960 --> 01:47:21.920]  in government do not like accountability they don't like to be held
[01:47:21.920 --> 01:47:26.600]  accountable about things but that we have to hold their feet to the fire we
[01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:31.680]  have to do that kind of stuff public servants serve the people the people
[01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:36.080]  don't serve the servants it's not that way it doesn't work that way they are
[01:47:36.080 --> 01:47:42.320]  not slave masters and people have to understand that over the years this
[01:47:42.320 --> 01:47:48.320]  programming has taken effect to where police officers and government officials
[01:47:48.320 --> 01:47:54.760]  and members of Congress feel entitled to this respect that they're not do I mean
[01:47:54.760 --> 01:47:59.720]  you should be proud that you serve the public but it's a sacrifice that's a
[01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:04.040]  supposed to be a sacrifice you're not supposed to profit off it you're not
[01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:09.000]  supposed to have a power grab from it it's a sacrifice and that's the way that
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:16.080]  I feel and that's what my job that's when when I talk about being a veteran or
[01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:21.880]  anything like that it's a sacrifice you give up years of your life for what to
[01:48:21.880 --> 01:48:26.360]  hopefully keep liberty and freedom for everybody but what a lot of people are
[01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:30.000]  coming to find out especially in the military and thank God they're donating
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:35.800]  in droves to Ron Paul is that they're what are they fighting for you know our
[01:48:35.800 --> 01:48:43.120]  tea just came out with a with a with a news piece that says suicides are are
[01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:48.320]  more they're more suicides and there are war deaths now no no it is the last
[01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:53.640]  number I saw is it's six times some numbers were even higher the former
[01:48:53.640 --> 01:48:58.800]  record number they're having more people commit suicide now that in World War
[01:48:58.800 --> 01:49:03.080]  two when there was five to six to seven times the number of people in the
[01:49:03.080 --> 01:49:08.120]  military I mean people are committing suicide we're in a depression the
[01:49:08.120 --> 01:49:12.280]  economy is falling apart everybody's freaked out the government the media
[01:49:12.280 --> 01:49:16.920]  these paid whores keep telling us everything's fine and it's just going
[01:49:16.920 --> 01:49:21.360]  to get crazier and crazier and crazier from this point but you know the good
[01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:25.440]  news that you brought forward and I see it as well as you were saying about half
[01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:29.000]  the people in the Department of Defense you talked to are really awake now and
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:33.760]  that those numbers are growing the other half 25% are just gung-ho and will jump
[01:49:33.760 --> 01:49:37.040]  off a clip of their told to and the other 25 just aren't you know aren't
[01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:41.960]  really that smart I guess so that's that's about what I'm seeing that I found
[01:49:41.960 --> 01:49:46.440]  people that are on the inside know that stuff's wrong even more than general
[01:49:46.440 --> 01:49:52.680]  public right but 99 I would say 99% just like you know Occupy Wall Street that
[01:49:52.680 --> 01:49:58.080]  number is very key 99% of people within government they just want to go home to
[01:49:58.080 --> 01:50:03.480]  their families you know whether or not they support the the policies of this
[01:50:03.480 --> 01:50:10.480]  dictatorship or they are awake and just silent they just at the end of the day
[01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:13.960]  they want to be left alone they don't want to be involved in all this kind of
[01:50:13.960 --> 01:50:18.560]  garbage but they don't want to exactly stick their necks out either and that's
[01:50:18.560 --> 01:50:24.360]  the problem we're past the point of well am I gonna be safe no no you're not
[01:50:24.360 --> 01:50:27.160]  gonna be safe if you don't say none of this did you hear the police officer and

[01:50:30.120 --> 01:50:33.240]  of people where the FBI said we'll kill you and your wife if you question
[01:50:33.240 --> 01:50:38.040]  Oklahoma City absolutely I mean I mean that's the real level of what we're
[01:50:38.040 --> 01:50:42.880]  facing and you know it's the same FBI the same crew that did all that they're
[01:50:42.880 --> 01:50:49.000]  in charge again right now unbelievable I mean that is so creepy folks people like
[01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:53.160]  well you better be scared then no we better stand up to these people I mean

[01:54:02.680 --> 01:54:08.040]  look at this article up at info wars dot com genetically modified mosquitoes to
[01:54:08.040 --> 01:54:12.040]  be released in the US for the first time number three years ago we played the
[01:54:12.040 --> 01:54:19.960]  clip of a speech that Bill Gates gave where he's all invested in this and he
[01:54:19.960 --> 01:54:24.760]  released GMO mosquitoes in the audience and they all thought it was funny that
[01:54:24.760 --> 01:54:29.360]  that boils down the mindset of these people doing stuff to you don't know
[01:54:29.360 --> 01:54:33.760]  about adding stuff to your water your food playing games scientific
[01:54:33.760 --> 01:54:39.400]  dictatorship control freaks they're coming out with an HIV vaccine that's
[01:54:39.400 --> 01:54:44.080]  got all sorts of bad things connected to it and the trials and different
[01:54:44.080 --> 01:54:48.160]  companies I mean we are in a brave new world they're coming out with food that
[01:54:48.160 --> 01:54:53.160]  has vaccine grown in it naturally pharmacological crops where you can't
[01:54:53.160 --> 01:54:59.400]  get away from it I mean our naivete is what's empowering this and we're
[01:54:59.400 --> 01:55:02.840]  talking to our guests in this segment the next Joe Joseph Department of
[01:55:02.840 --> 01:55:09.480]  Defense civil servant Navy veteran before that and he's saying a lot of
[01:55:09.480 --> 01:55:12.680]  people in the military are awake you know what shocked me Joe was when I had
[01:55:12.680 --> 01:55:17.680]  that Oklahoma City police officer canine unit fell on Marine Corps Vietnam
[01:55:17.680 --> 01:55:20.720]  veteran whole nine yards he talked about some of his buddies that were
[01:55:20.720 --> 01:55:25.280]  murdered by the FBI and all the rest of it and I've and we've talked to other
[01:55:25.280 --> 01:55:29.720]  police who also investigated it were threatened and in Department of Defense
[01:55:29.720 --> 01:55:33.360]  people who were there at the bomb squad threatened by the feds imagine you're a
[01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:37.280]  DoD did bomb disposal in the FBI and ATF walk up and go you're asking about these
[01:55:37.280 --> 01:55:41.440]  other bombs we your daughter goes to school here we're gonna kill her I mean I
[01:55:41.440 --> 01:55:43.880]  don't know how people just sit there and take that I mean I'm not saying these
[01:55:43.880 --> 01:55:47.880]  cops are wimps or whatever that hasn't happened to me and I can just tell you
[01:55:47.880 --> 01:55:52.120]  right now it's not even a question of courage I've I got a problem I mean I
[01:55:52.120 --> 01:55:56.920]  people threaten my family I get very aggressive very quickly and and that's
[01:55:56.920 --> 01:55:59.720]  just the way it is I mean that's normally come up to a mama that's got her
[01:55:59.720 --> 01:56:03.080]  baby raccoon and try to get the baby raccoon I mean the raccoon will tear a
[01:56:03.080 --> 01:56:07.120]  man to pieces or a hunting dog I mean it's just any animal defense it's young
[01:56:07.120 --> 01:56:12.000]  a rat will do that and but I mean he just shows the evil but he said oh yeah
[01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:16.720]  almost all the police know years ago they wouldn't say but but now that almost
[01:56:16.720 --> 01:56:19.920]  all of know the government did it I mean here's a whole department of cops
[01:56:19.920 --> 01:56:24.920]  standing there knowing the FBI was there and did it with the ATF and they're all
[01:56:24.920 --> 01:56:29.640]  scared of them because they threatened to kill them I mean I mean this I can't
[01:56:29.640 --> 01:56:36.320]  believe that that that people bow to such authority when it's obviously evil
[01:56:36.320 --> 01:56:43.680]  fear is such a paralyzing feeling and when you when you enter children into
[01:56:43.680 --> 01:56:49.460]  the into the mix especially if you're a parent it it will almost certainly
[01:56:49.460 --> 01:56:53.360]  freeze you in your tracks and they just bombed kids there so they were letting
[01:56:53.360 --> 01:56:56.960]  them know we will kill kids yeah right well see one thing that gives me strength
[01:56:56.960 --> 01:57:04.160]  is my spirituality and the fact that that I believe truly that we are just we
[01:57:04.160 --> 01:57:09.880]  are caretakers of the children and they really belong to to the Creator to God
[01:57:09.880 --> 01:57:14.840]  and that he's going to take care of them one way or another you know you kill
[01:57:14.840 --> 01:57:18.960]  him he's going to take care of them and I I'll bet you what goes around comes
[01:57:18.960 --> 01:57:23.080]  around that's just my personal feeling oh that's oh yeah you know what I mean
[01:57:23.080 --> 01:57:26.840]  what goes around comes around there's gonna be a day when these people all of
[01:57:26.840 --> 01:57:32.600]  these scumbags have to answer for what they've done and it may not be today or
[01:57:32.600 --> 01:57:36.800]  tomorrow or a year from now but one day they're gonna have to do it and I gain
[01:57:36.800 --> 01:57:42.320]  strength and solace from that just that fact alone but you know one of the
[01:57:42.320 --> 01:57:46.960]  things that you have to do when they do that is stand up to them put the barrel
[01:57:46.960 --> 01:57:50.120]  of the gun on my forehead you want to know something you better pull the
[01:57:50.120 --> 01:57:54.160]  trigger because if you don't you're in big trouble and that's and that's the
[01:57:54.160 --> 01:58:00.080]  way you have to attack this thing is from a standpoint of don't let them push
[01:58:00.080 --> 01:58:03.800]  you around no it's no surrender you have to commit and that's the end of it say
[01:58:03.800 --> 01:58:09.200]  God it's in your hands fire torpedoes that's right and if the biggest thing if
[01:58:09.200 --> 01:58:15.440]  there's one thing I can tell everybody today you are not alone you're not alone
[01:58:15.440 --> 01:58:20.920]  so don't feel lonely in this fight that's right it's a small grip of criminals
[01:58:20.920 --> 01:58:25.760]  at the top that killed those kids at okc that's right and if we just stop it's
[01:58:25.760 --> 01:58:29.440]  like watching a little bitty chihuahua even a big dog it'll dominate him and
[01:58:29.440 --> 01:58:34.520]  the big dog it's all a mind game if it ever realized it's the big dog it's got
[01:58:34.520 --> 01:58:40.440]  teeth an inch long the little dog has teeth and aren't even a centimeter long
[01:58:40.600 --> 01:58:52.120]  you are listening to GCN visit GCN live comm today this is Alex Jones with five

[01:59:13.360 --> 01:59:18.080]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:59:18.080 --> 01:59:21.880]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:59:21.880 --> 01:59:25.480]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[01:59:25.480 --> 01:59:29.880]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[02:00:31.440 --> 02:00:35.240]  got to be an example to others and we will turn the tide against this evil
[02:00:35.240 --> 02:00:39.840]  it's always darkest before the dawn and finishing up with Joe Joseph you can
[02:00:39.840 --> 02:00:43.160]  watch the full interview with him up at prisonplanet.tv we had him on a few
[02:00:43.160 --> 02:00:47.600]  nights ago other points about all this coming together the expansion of
[02:00:47.600 --> 02:00:53.440]  domestic checkpoints by the feds the brigade homeland the big red one coming
[02:00:53.440 --> 02:00:57.840]  home the announcements that troops will be used that political dissidents will be
[02:00:57.840 --> 02:01:01.200]  targeted I mean they're really heating it up they're really flipping the
[02:01:01.200 --> 02:01:06.120]  switches on they are you know they've built behind the scenes this grid now
[02:01:06.120 --> 02:01:10.000]  they're firing it up well why do you think everything's moving so fast right
[02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:14.120]  now you know it could be any number of reasons one thing that I've noticed in
[02:01:14.120 --> 02:01:19.200]  in my short time that I've been researching this stuff is that events
[02:01:19.200 --> 02:01:24.560]  never seem to happen the way you envision it or that you you foresee it it
[02:01:24.560 --> 02:01:28.240]  always something out of left field comes out and totally hits you like a like a
[02:01:28.240 --> 02:01:32.960]  left hook yeah bio weapon release a new coming I mean look at all these planes
[02:01:32.960 --> 02:01:39.360]  that that fly over top of us every day spraying chemtrails one day who knows it
[02:01:39.360 --> 02:01:43.720]  could be a bola it could be anything and what happens then I mean we just go on
[02:01:43.720 --> 02:01:46.880]  about our business well that's the deal people are worried about the FBI and I
[02:01:46.880 --> 02:01:52.000]  am blowing up some kids but but and the ATF but I mean this is a government on
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:56.240]  records saying they want to put stuff in our vaccines and kill us yeah I mean I
[02:01:56.240 --> 02:02:00.520]  mean that's what I'm saying it's just either pure evil it could happen is so
[02:02:00.520 --> 02:02:04.880]  many different ways you know I and I don't I don't have an answer to that all
[02:02:04.880 --> 02:02:08.920]  I can say is and I have a little I have a bit of good good news actually is in
[02:02:08.920 --> 02:02:14.280]  the folks at the American Truth Network comm have engaged congressman Kucinich
[02:02:14.280 --> 02:02:19.600]  they've talked to him last night and he's very troubled by this and is looking
[02:02:19.600 --> 02:02:24.560]  into it as we speak so that that is some very very good news on that front
[02:02:24.560 --> 02:02:28.240]  because you know Ron Paul's aware of this he knows what it is and he called it
[02:02:28.240 --> 02:02:32.160]  out just like it is on your show this is the implementation of martial law in
[02:02:32.160 --> 02:02:37.040]  this country and you know my the thing that I want people to understand is
[02:02:37.040 --> 02:02:42.080]  over time haven't they already instituted it to a certain point I mean
[02:02:42.080 --> 02:02:46.240]  viper checkpoints are you kidding me hey people are getting arrested for
[02:02:46.240 --> 02:02:50.760]  showing their neighbor a silver coin cops think it's illegal it'd be in best buy
[02:02:50.760 --> 02:02:55.240]  you get arrested if you try to buy something with two dollar bills yes and
[02:02:55.240 --> 02:02:57.920]  then you're and the police come in and they're like they don't even know it's
[02:02:57.920 --> 02:03:03.480]  real money and you go to jail this is tyranny that is tyranny at his face
[02:03:03.480 --> 02:03:07.360]  don't ever let them say well you know we have to do this in order to maintain
[02:03:07.360 --> 02:03:11.600]  our freedom what freedom go look overseas if you ever get a chance go
[02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:15.800]  overseas how much more free are we here than they are over there listen I talked
[02:03:15.800 --> 02:03:18.640]  to Watson and others who he goes to China a few times a year as his wife's
[02:03:18.640 --> 02:03:22.760]  Chinese and he says there's no no checkpoint no security no nothing in
[02:03:22.760 --> 02:03:27.520]  communist China no they're freer than we are well that's because the Chinese
[02:03:27.520 --> 02:03:32.080]  will riot yeah well there's you know and there's strength in numbers that's the
[02:03:32.080 --> 02:03:36.520]  other thing too you know this is a very very very very small minority of people
[02:03:36.520 --> 02:03:41.280]  that are doing this and we are strong where there are a lot of people in this
[02:03:41.280 --> 02:03:46.080]  country and that's what people don't understand right this is in 1995 or they
[02:03:46.080 --> 02:03:50.960]  could blow up a building and poses the saviors and try to frame patriots they
[02:03:50.960 --> 02:03:55.120]  have like a 50% approval rating in Congress then now it's 9% I mean they're
[02:03:55.120 --> 02:03:58.960]  done we are the majority they're done and that's why they want to start this new
[02:03:58.960 --> 02:04:04.640]  war Leah a Panetta's come out and said they may go ahead and hit Iran so now
[02:04:04.640 --> 02:04:08.960]  Iran says they're doing a drill to shut down the Strait of Hormuz I've talked to
[02:04:08.960 --> 02:04:13.640]  a lot of military people and they say that the attack on Iran is going to take
[02:04:13.640 --> 02:04:18.240]  place the question is when I don't doubt it for a second I mean they need the
[02:04:18.240 --> 02:04:23.200]  wars to sustain the you know the bankers the bankers need this they're hungry for
[02:04:23.200 --> 02:04:26.960]  more which is which is crazy because they've practically looted everything
[02:04:26.960 --> 02:04:33.640]  we've got and it's just a now it's gonna be once the debt becomes so large and so
[02:04:33.640 --> 02:04:37.240]  vast it's gonna be like Greece okay well now give us your parks and give us
[02:04:37.240 --> 02:04:40.960]  your land and give us your property because we need that is collateral and

[02:07:05.880 --> 02:07:11.520]  is our last chance to not relive history as a finishing off this agenda that we
[02:07:11.520 --> 02:07:14.120]  pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[02:07:14.120 --> 02:07:19.440]  tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[02:07:19.440 --> 02:07:24.720]  the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[02:07:24.720 --> 02:07:29.280]  attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[02:07:29.280 --> 02:07:33.960]  offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[02:07:33.960 --> 02:07:38.000]  constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're
[02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:41.680]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who to make the check out to
[02:07:41.680 --> 02:07:46.760]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen
[02:07:46.760 --> 02:07:52.840]  a fall of the Republic yet your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info

[02:08:06.040 --> 02:08:08.880]  radio network
[02:08:11.680 --> 02:08:15.960]  we got info wars dot com in the featured news area we have this article
[02:08:15.960 --> 02:08:19.640]  already mentioned but it's incredible genetically modified mosquitoes to be
[02:08:19.640 --> 02:08:24.440]  released into the U.S. for the first time and it's a mosquito GMO that will
[02:08:24.440 --> 02:08:29.720]  actually breed with the mosquitoes and make them sterile reduce their numbers
[02:08:29.720 --> 02:08:33.640]  and the question is what will that do getting rid of mosquitoes you know already
[02:08:33.640 --> 02:08:39.680]  most the honey bees are dying and I mean I talk about chain reactions and they
[02:08:39.680 --> 02:08:42.920]  admit that some of these are female mosquitoes that's the gender that bites
[02:08:42.920 --> 02:08:49.480]  humans what is this going to do to humans and it just goes on and on and
[02:08:49.480 --> 02:08:54.200]  on of the report again genetically modified mosquitoes to be released in
[02:08:54.200 --> 02:08:57.680]  the U.S. for the first time and Bill Gates is talking about releasing
[02:08:57.680 --> 02:09:03.760]  mosquitoes that have vaccines in them so you have no way to escape it this is
[02:09:03.760 --> 02:09:08.960]  the type of ultra ultra weirdness going on and continuing
[02:09:08.960 --> 02:09:13.760]  genrich labels Ron Paul entire support basis people who want to legalize
[02:09:13.760 --> 02:09:18.240]  drugs you mean like they were before the 30s when they got rid of alcohol
[02:09:18.240 --> 02:09:20.840]  prohibition they needed something new for the Mafia and the government make
[02:09:20.840 --> 02:09:26.800]  money off of so they made all the drugs you could buy at the local pharmacy at
[02:09:26.800 --> 02:09:29.920]  local drugstore they made them illegal so they could shut down their
[02:09:29.920 --> 02:09:33.800]  competition and make huge profits and so the drug heads with Rob people's
[02:09:33.800 --> 02:09:39.960]  houses to pay for the stuff marked up 20 30 times I mean we got more people on
[02:09:39.960 --> 02:09:44.360]  drugs more people in prison government caught everywhere dealing it I mean the
[02:09:44.360 --> 02:09:50.920]  smart criminals just go join the FBI ATF DEA Border Patrol Coast Guard
[02:09:50.920 --> 02:09:55.560]  Homeland Security they just drive in and out in Homeland Security delivering
[02:09:55.560 --> 02:09:59.960]  cocaine every day all the locals know it all over the coast they get caught all
[02:09:59.960 --> 02:10:04.200]  the time it just gets shut down I mean the government brings the majority of
[02:10:04.200 --> 02:10:09.760]  drugs in it's been a congressional hearings for decades and there's all
[02:10:09.760 --> 02:10:13.560]  these articles attacking Ron Paul Ron Paul says the CIA deals drugs he's
[02:10:13.560 --> 02:10:22.440]  insane he said it on Alex Jones's show and others 1996 CIA solicitor general
[02:10:22.440 --> 02:10:27.240]  admitted it you had it in the 70s in Vietnam admitted you have Mina Arkansas
[02:10:27.240 --> 02:10:31.960]  admitted you have fast and furious admitted you have the CIA aircraft full
[02:10:31.960 --> 02:10:36.600]  of four tons of pure cocaine crashing you got Esquire reporting on it I mean
[02:10:36.600 --> 02:10:44.320]  it's it's well-known I've had Serpico on I said how many Serpico of the New
[02:10:44.320 --> 02:10:51.400]  York narcotics police were drug dealing he goes all of them but me all of them
[02:10:51.400 --> 02:11:03.800]  all of them all ALL all ALL all after Serpico what they fired 76% of them
[02:11:03.800 --> 02:11:09.560]  because he exposed they shot him in the face oh and let me tell you when they
[02:11:09.560 --> 02:11:13.280]  went when the corrupt mafia that has badges and guns kills you you don't
[02:11:13.280 --> 02:11:17.920]  get the big funeral they even do that when they kill you you don't even get
[02:11:17.920 --> 02:11:21.880]  the big funeral or the investigation and all that you treated like dirt they
[02:11:21.880 --> 02:11:26.240]  don't even play along when your department kills you now all the
[02:11:26.240 --> 02:11:29.280]  departments aren't like this but the system's trying to set it up to that
[02:11:29.280 --> 02:11:34.760]  point and I'll say it again the globalists know that we're awake so
[02:11:34.760 --> 02:11:37.740]  they're moving fast now Bob Chapman of course was the biggest private
[02:11:37.740 --> 02:11:41.920]  silver and gold broker until he retired he also had of course the very famous
[02:11:41.920 --> 02:11:44.800]  newsletter until he retired he's been back in the last decade with the
[02:11:44.800 --> 02:11:49.680]  international forecaster and he's a patriot of more than 50 years exposing
[02:11:49.680 --> 02:11:55.480]  the globalist and he joins us every Friday and he's here with us now today
[02:11:55.480 --> 02:11:59.560]  well since we had you on last week the head of the IMF says we're entering a
[02:11:59.560 --> 02:12:04.200]  1930s style depression Krugman at the New York Times admits we're in a
[02:12:04.200 --> 02:12:08.080]  depression of course we've been in one for over three years as you know more
[02:12:08.080 --> 02:12:14.080]  and more mainstream media has to admit the unemployment's more like 22 not 9
[02:12:14.480 --> 02:12:21.200]  crime is exploding and we've got new giant bailouts which are really direct
[02:12:21.200 --> 02:12:25.400]  taxes to the bankers in Europe all of this is happening people are bailing on
[02:12:25.400 --> 02:12:30.440]  the stock market again Bob the MF global is obviously knocked down gold and
[02:12:30.440 --> 02:12:35.000]  silver prices because it's totally killed any speculation in the market but
[02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:38.160]  hadn't knocked it down as much as someone have thought MF global is
[02:12:38.160 --> 02:12:44.680]  ongoing all of this is happening and here we are just steering right for a
[02:12:44.680 --> 02:12:48.600]  even bigger iceberg we've already run into three or four and the establishment
[02:12:48.600 --> 02:12:53.480]  saying throw more coal accelerate towards the iceberg I want to get your
[02:12:53.480 --> 02:12:58.640]  take on the latest with the euro crisis and England refusing to be part of
[02:12:58.640 --> 02:13:02.640]  that and then I want to get into obviously I'm sure you've seen all the
[02:13:02.640 --> 02:13:06.800]  FEMA documents that listeners pointed us to on official government sites which
[02:13:06.800 --> 02:13:10.520]  they've now pulled showing the guilty activity where they admit they're
[02:13:10.520 --> 02:13:16.240]  preparing the military to occupy the US and the FEMA camps and use the quote
[02:13:16.240 --> 02:13:20.560]  blue force military against the Red Force American citizens this is huge
[02:13:20.560 --> 02:13:24.760]  confirmation do you ever get like a sick feeling Bob is it all just gets
[02:13:24.760 --> 02:13:29.600]  confirmed in spades everything that we tracked and I mean it's disgusting Bob
[02:13:29.600 --> 02:13:35.560]  Chapman well it's not nothing that you and I don't expect and some of the
[02:13:35.560 --> 02:13:42.360]  listeners to some people it's shocking it's even shocking to us because we go
[02:13:42.360 --> 02:13:49.360]  back a number of years investigating this yourself almost 20 years and myself
[02:13:49.360 --> 02:13:57.360]  over 50 to address the different things you mentioned for those who don't know
[02:13:57.360 --> 02:14:04.240]  the European Central Bank is going to monetize about six hundred billion
[02:14:04.240 --> 02:14:09.040]  dollars and that will be added to about four hundred billion that the Bundes
[02:14:09.040 --> 02:14:16.920]  Bank gave them recently secretly and they will be able to buy six months maybe
[02:14:16.920 --> 02:14:21.240]  a year depending upon how they spend the money but I think it'll be six months
[02:14:21.240 --> 02:14:25.640]  and then they'll be out there looking for more money there's also a swap
[02:14:25.640 --> 02:14:31.240]  arrangement between the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank and what
[02:14:31.240 --> 02:14:37.200]  that means is the Fed creates money out of thin air and digitally gives it to
[02:14:37.200 --> 02:14:44.400]  the European Central Bank and they supposedly give an equal amount of
[02:14:44.400 --> 02:14:49.440]  euros to the Federal Reserve but I really don't think it works that way I
[02:14:49.440 --> 02:14:53.920]  think it's a one-way street with the Fed giving the money how much another
[02:14:53.920 --> 02:15:02.120]  trillion what are the problems to date the six nations and make them whole
[02:15:02.120 --> 02:15:07.880]  enough to go sideways perhaps for six months to a year they need six trillion
[02:15:07.880 --> 02:15:13.520]  so we just talked about two trillion so that would mean that they need another
[02:15:13.520 --> 02:15:20.080]  the four before the end of next year and so it's extending the problem not
[02:15:20.080 --> 02:15:26.800]  facing it trying to figure out what to do in the interim and the upshot of all
[02:15:26.800 --> 02:15:32.520]  of that in Europe England in the United States will be higher inflation how much
[02:15:32.520 --> 02:15:39.320]  higher remains to be seen but it could be substantial as far as the MF is
[02:15:39.320 --> 02:15:48.040]  concerned that's the commodity house that went bankrupt first of all I'm the
[02:15:48.040 --> 02:15:54.200]  only one that I know of that said that it was legal to remove anything from a
[02:15:54.200 --> 02:16:01.920]  margin account in hypothecation and re-hypothecation it has now been borne
[02:16:01.920 --> 02:16:08.160]  out by the SEC in the case of Lehman holdings where Lehman's not going to be
[02:16:08.160 --> 02:16:12.880]  able excuse me where Barclays is not going to be able to keep three billion
[02:16:12.880 --> 02:16:19.640]  dollars because the judge says in the SEC agrees correctly that the UK banks
[02:16:19.640 --> 02:16:25.880]  claim to securities in customers that reserve which are margin accounts was
[02:16:25.880 --> 02:16:30.320]  conditional and what they mean by that is that if there's money left over you
[02:16:30.320 --> 02:16:34.200]  guys can have it but all the shareholders are going to get paid off
[02:16:34.200 --> 02:16:41.960]  first now this is the Lehman deal the CFTC came back and Judge Peck in the
[02:16:41.960 --> 02:16:48.000]  case of MF said the same thing is going to happen but here's the issue here's
[02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:53.680]  the issue regardless of that different interpretations of that Bob and I'm not
[02:16:53.680 --> 02:16:58.920]  saying you're wrong if you look at this CMT put out press release is saying it
[02:16:58.920 --> 02:17:03.840]  was all guaranteed and Corzine went and lied and said I don't know where the
[02:17:03.840 --> 02:17:07.280]  money went the head of the CMT said no I was in the meetings he's one that gave
[02:17:07.280 --> 02:17:13.080]  the order so he is caught perjuring himself and it is you know fraudulent
[02:17:13.080 --> 02:17:17.480]  to raid those accounts and then say he didn't know where it went well if it was
[02:17:17.480 --> 02:17:24.240]  intermingling and we don't know that and if the money was taken and
[02:17:24.240 --> 02:17:30.960]  hypothecated and then rehypothecated to another institution let's say JP Morgan
[02:17:30.960 --> 02:17:38.280]  Chase then that would have been legal but if they took it and mixed the assets
[02:17:38.280 --> 02:17:46.440]  of the people who have accounts had accounts on margin that would be
[02:17:46.440 --> 02:17:52.480]  fraud and a criminal activity but we don't know that yet nobody does well we
[02:17:52.480 --> 02:17:56.040]  don't know that because the feds say they don't know how to track money I mean
[02:17:56.040 --> 02:18:00.960]  you know you and I both know that that is a lie oh it's pure ball they're trying
[02:18:00.960 --> 02:18:05.560]  to gain trial a time to whitewash this thing and I can understand why they're
[02:18:05.560 --> 02:18:10.480]  doing it they're all crooks but the point here is there's been a lot of it
[02:18:10.480 --> 02:18:19.440]  misinformation it's caused people to not to participate in the commodity market
[02:18:19.440 --> 02:18:25.400]  the the comics like they had regularly be doing been doing and and I can
[02:18:25.400 --> 02:18:31.040]  understand that and obviously a lot of them didn't read their contract because
[02:18:31.040 --> 02:18:36.920]  every contract is virtually the same and it says we can hypothecate rehypothecate
[02:18:36.920 --> 02:18:41.920]  and at the end of it and it's been that way for the 50 odd years I've been
[02:18:41.920 --> 02:18:49.600]  involved Bob we're about to go to break what do you make of the banks announcing
[02:18:49.600 --> 02:18:54.000]  this week that they want extra cash on hand of the federal government's the
[02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:57.080]  FDIC's telling the banks that and the private
[02:18:57.080 --> 02:19:03.120]  Federal Reserve is as well what do you make of those moves I think probably
[02:19:03.120 --> 02:19:09.240]  they feel that during this season there'll be more of a demand for dollars
[02:19:09.240 --> 02:19:15.600]  if you go to the bank and I heard the story so many times it wanted withdraw
[02:19:15.600 --> 02:19:21.040]  $8,000 of your funds they say sure I will order it for you and come back in
[02:19:21.040 --> 02:19:25.480]  two weeks and get it or why do you want to do this so what are you gonna spend

[02:24:15.200 --> 02:24:22.720]  I'm now looking at an article by Kurt Nemo where the media is calling Ron Paul
[02:24:22.720 --> 02:24:32.000]  stunted a stunted idiot because he supports the Constitution now they're
[02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:35.880]  openly decrying the Constitution remember the cover of Newsweek about
[02:24:35.880 --> 02:24:39.720]  getting rid of the Constitution it caused our problems no the globalists
[02:24:39.720 --> 02:24:48.480]  have gotten rid of the Constitution and now our problems are just beginning now
[02:24:48.480 --> 02:24:56.240]  going back to Bob Chapman here Bob you know here talking to you about the
[02:24:56.240 --> 02:24:59.800]  state of the world why do you think they're gearing up the FEMA camps
[02:24:59.800 --> 02:25:04.600]  massively expanding TSA checkpoints I mean obviously that they want to clamp
[02:25:04.600 --> 02:25:10.520]  down on the public but I don't see this working and I mean there's got to be a
[02:25:10.520 --> 02:25:14.400]  method of the madness I guess the globalists just think they can consolidate
[02:25:14.400 --> 02:25:19.200]  total power and control but I mean if I was a globalist and had all this control
[02:25:19.200 --> 02:25:25.480]  I wouldn't want to screw everything up but I guess it's just their nature Bob
[02:25:25.480 --> 02:25:32.640]  well I give this a lot of thought and I do think there'll be an election some
[02:25:32.640 --> 02:25:41.480]  people do think that there might not be and if Ron Paul runs against Obama then
[02:25:41.480 --> 02:25:48.440]  I think between now and the election that they'll really cool it on picking
[02:25:48.440 --> 02:25:55.240]  people up but the people that they do pick up will be selected because of
[02:25:55.240 --> 02:26:02.160]  their religion and national origin and that would be Muslims and you know
[02:26:02.160 --> 02:26:07.200]  Americans would say well who cares about that Muslim over there and I think they
[02:26:07.200 --> 02:26:13.400]  would selectively start doing that during the coming year and after the
[02:26:13.400 --> 02:26:20.240]  election were Ron Paul to be elected then a lot of this would be reversed a
[02:26:20.240 --> 02:26:28.000]  lot of things will be real reversed and you all know that but if Mr. Obama was
[02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:33.560]  then reelected then they would turn on the faucet because there's no elections
[02:26:33.560 --> 02:26:37.520]  in sight and they don't care that much about the congressional elections and
[02:26:37.520 --> 02:26:43.600]  so they would go ahead and start slapping people like Alex and I in jail if
[02:26:43.600 --> 02:26:48.520]  they can find us and that's the way I think they're going to do it it's going
[02:26:48.520 --> 02:26:54.760]  to be imperceptible over the next year and then after that they'll get serious
[02:26:54.760 --> 02:27:02.040]  and what will that be based on a falling economy today they came out with
[02:27:02.040 --> 02:27:06.960]  figures people are spending more that they're making and their wages didn't
[02:27:06.960 --> 02:27:12.840]  expand at all over the last quarter and that's been pretty much the case over
[02:27:12.840 --> 02:27:18.960]  the last several years and more and more people are going to lose their jobs and
[02:27:18.960 --> 02:27:24.040]  unless banks start lending a lot of money the small and medium-sized firms
[02:27:24.040 --> 02:27:29.680]  which creates 70% of the jobs and so that would be the catalyst higher
[02:27:29.680 --> 02:27:38.240]  unemployment are they going to extend the extended unemployment beyond the end
[02:27:38.240 --> 02:27:44.600]  of February I don't know but if they do not then that could be a cause of
[02:27:44.600 --> 02:27:49.760]  trouble and so I think they're just setting up and getting ready to pick
[02:27:49.760 --> 02:27:57.080]  their spots and you've got the Defense Secretary saying we may hit Iran you've
[02:27:57.080 --> 02:28:00.920]  got the Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman two days ago saying yeah we're going to
[02:28:00.920 --> 02:28:05.720]  probably hit Iran and then you've got all these reports of different Western
[02:28:05.720 --> 02:28:09.760]  funded terror groups blowing stuff up in Iran they're really trying to poke them
[02:28:09.760 --> 02:28:13.320]  into doing something and the Iranians are saying okay we're going to do another
[02:28:13.320 --> 02:28:18.040]  drill of shutting down the Strait of Hormuz what do you think about what the
[02:28:18.040 --> 02:28:25.080]  West is doing versus the Iranians well I think the West is trying to pick a
[02:28:25.080 --> 02:28:30.680]  fight and the Iranians are trying to avoid it because it's loose loose for
[02:28:30.680 --> 02:28:37.600]  them but on the other hand the the damage they inflict on the United
[02:28:37.600 --> 02:28:43.400]  States forces as well as the Israeli Israelis and as well as Israel could be
[02:28:43.400 --> 02:28:50.600]  substantial and will Russia get involved or will China get involved I can
[02:28:50.600 --> 02:28:56.440]  answer that question but and especially with a Russian election coming up which
[02:28:56.440 --> 02:29:02.120]  is not that far away and so yes they're going to do something but I don't know
[02:29:02.120 --> 02:29:05.520]  when they're going to do it I mean this thing's been dragging on for four years
[02:29:05.520 --> 02:29:13.040]  and so maybe they'll do some other things like hit one Muslim nation against
[02:29:13.040 --> 02:29:18.200]  another these people have a lot of arguments between each other even though
[02:29:18.200 --> 02:29:23.320]  they share a common religion and so all is not cope aesthetic so well that's
[02:29:23.320 --> 02:29:26.720]  another point they shell it in the West like every Muslim wants to kill every
[02:29:26.720 --> 02:29:32.200]  Western or Christian I mean those groups hate each other probably if there is all
[02:29:32.200 --> 02:29:38.000]  this hate ten times more Shiite Sunni I mean it the Saudi Arabians and Iranians
[02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:42.640]  at least governments absolutely hate each other just like Iran and Iraq I
[02:29:42.640 --> 02:29:47.080]  mean the idea that the Muslims are going to come get us it's a paper tiger and
[02:29:47.080 --> 02:29:54.880]  al-Qaeda is Western created we're on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones
[02:29:54.880 --> 02:29:58.920]  and the GCN radio network

[02:33:00.560 --> 02:33:25.280]  I got pretty emotional at the start of the last hour when I was just thinking
[02:33:25.280 --> 02:33:29.360]  about all the crimes the globalists commit it is so staggering for somebody
[02:33:29.360 --> 02:33:35.520]  who's not a psychopathic control freak just a normal person to discover this
[02:33:35.520 --> 02:33:42.520]  and then to have the paradox of a giant group of sheeple who have no idea what's
[02:33:42.520 --> 02:33:48.440]  happening to them versus a tiny group of just really dangerous people who are
[02:33:48.440 --> 02:33:52.320]  real-life monsters walking around you're about monsters in the countryside
[02:33:52.320 --> 02:33:57.760]  these are humans but what's in their minds is beyond any fiction you could
[02:33:57.760 --> 02:34:03.880]  imagine jacking with the food jacking with the water official Rockefeller
[02:34:03.880 --> 02:34:08.600]  Foundation documents you know we put out a year ago linking right to their site
[02:34:08.600 --> 02:34:11.720]  where they're like yeah we're developing sterilence in the vaccines and the water
[02:34:11.720 --> 02:34:16.280]  and how great it is and cancer viruses and you learn in the 20s they discovered
[02:34:16.280 --> 02:34:21.080]  that most cancer was viral and so they pushed vaccines and have it added to it
[02:34:21.080 --> 02:34:26.240]  and cancers up several thousand percent diabetes neurological disorders I mean
[02:34:26.240 --> 02:34:30.520]  that right there that out of all the major phosphate minds they're getting
[02:34:30.520 --> 02:34:34.480]  radioactive isotopes along with the fluoride and they add it to the water
[02:34:34.480 --> 02:34:41.240]  and that they get off on lowering people's IQs giving them degenerative
[02:34:41.240 --> 02:34:49.400]  diseases you wonder why folks can't get angry we're poisoned and then it's real
[02:34:49.400 --> 02:34:53.280]  and then a cop pulls you over and wants to search your car and you're like the
[02:34:53.280 --> 02:34:56.720]  government puts poison in your water and they're like I know I hear your show I
[02:34:56.720 --> 02:35:00.680]  want to search your car well do you believe me yeah I believe you I don't
[02:35:00.680 --> 02:35:08.480]  it's like they're in a trance it's like okay I'm saying this it's true what are
[02:35:08.480 --> 02:35:14.320]  we gonna do about it it's so over the top and and then I'm gonna say it again
[02:35:14.320 --> 02:35:19.480]  it it's good that I can still get really freaked out because I'm so close to this
[02:35:19.480 --> 02:35:22.240]  all the time I know Bob has been doing it longer than I have fighting tyranny
[02:35:22.240 --> 02:35:26.200]  that you tend to get numb to it but let me tell you talking to cops over the
[02:35:26.200 --> 02:35:30.120]  phone military people police officers over the years having them on the show
[02:35:30.120 --> 02:35:33.800]  just from Oklahoma City who pulled up like a minute after and saw the feds
[02:35:33.800 --> 02:35:37.440]  running around and lying and saying they'd been in the building when clearly
[02:35:37.440 --> 02:35:40.000]  they hadn't been and then threatening them and saying I'll kill you and your
[02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:45.640]  family you mean that really just totally brings it home that everything we've
[02:35:45.640 --> 02:35:51.200]  said and talked about is unfortunately right on target and worse than we can
[02:35:51.200 --> 02:35:56.920]  say I mean Bob I'm ranting here but do you ever just just get dumbfounded by how
[02:35:56.920 --> 02:36:07.000]  far this corruption can go well yes and that's natural and yes also I expected
[02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:11.480]  things like this to happen because over the years we didn't have the ability to
[02:36:11.480 --> 02:36:17.360]  reach the people as we have over the last 15 to 20 years so but we have had a
[02:36:17.360 --> 02:36:25.440]  chance and we've done well but not as well as we could I had a letter from
[02:36:25.440 --> 02:36:33.240]  someone who was leaving Blackwater that said that he'd been recruited to run an
[02:36:33.240 --> 02:36:43.080]  internment camp in New Hampshire and he said that he told the government no I
[02:36:43.080 --> 02:36:49.760]  don't want to take that I'm not interested in that assignment and and he
[02:36:49.760 --> 02:36:55.320]  said I want to protect my family and so all of the things that we've been
[02:36:55.320 --> 02:37:02.320]  hearing about retiring policemen people coming out of the military now people
[02:37:02.320 --> 02:37:08.680]  from Blackwater are being recruited for these kinds of jobs in this case a
[02:37:08.680 --> 02:37:14.800]  leadership position and other things so it is real they are aligning this whole
[02:37:14.800 --> 02:37:23.800]  thing up what do we do then just get across the true sense of urgency to
[02:37:23.800 --> 02:37:28.360]  people and explain this isn't science fiction ladies and gentlemen you need to
[02:37:28.360 --> 02:37:33.120]  make a decision about what you're gonna do that's right and you've got to
[02:37:33.120 --> 02:37:40.080]  participate you've got to get Ron Paul elected because if you do not you doomed
[02:37:40.080 --> 02:37:45.960]  and if you do get them elected it'll be a hard fight to reverse all of what's
[02:37:45.960 --> 02:37:51.680]  gone down over the past 20 years I mean I could there's a whole litany of
[02:37:51.680 --> 02:37:56.440]  things that have to be changed and I'm sure Ron Paul will go after it right
[02:37:56.440 --> 02:38:04.600]  away and I'm sure that as Alex and others have discussed with Ron he'll be a
[02:38:04.600 --> 02:38:11.080]  target there's no question and that's why the vice president is such an would
[02:38:11.080 --> 02:38:18.920]  be such an important person and so this is not key this is our legal key to be
[02:38:18.920 --> 02:38:22.800]  able to stop these people so we got to get Ron Paul and people like him
[02:38:22.800 --> 02:38:30.840]  elected we can make the changes yes they might assassinate him he knows that and
[02:38:30.840 --> 02:38:36.480]  he doesn't want to leave his family but you know he's an elderly man and so
[02:38:36.480 --> 02:38:41.520]  he's lived his life and he's sacrificing himself for the American people and then
[02:38:41.520 --> 02:38:46.920]  I see these people attacking him I can understand how the CFR and the
[02:38:46.920 --> 02:38:52.800]  trilats and the Bilderbergers and members of the Illuminati attack him but I see
[02:38:52.800 --> 02:38:59.960]  others is probably getting paid to attack him and it's disgusting well I
[02:38:59.960 --> 02:39:04.080]  tell you Ron Paul is really illustrating for the public just how
[02:39:04.080 --> 02:39:08.960]  controlled the corporate so-called mainline media is and all their tricks
[02:39:08.960 --> 02:39:13.200]  aren't working like they used to so I guess that's why they're moving ahead
[02:39:13.200 --> 02:39:17.840]  with the martial law the criminals that have taken over recognize they're not
[02:39:17.840 --> 02:39:21.120]  going to be able to bamboozle us anymore so they think they're going to fall
[02:39:21.120 --> 02:39:27.360]  back on the police state measures and I guess bringing a bio attack deposes our
[02:39:27.360 --> 02:39:34.320]  saviors and use that as a cover or terror attack or a mix of them a Iran war
[02:39:34.320 --> 02:39:41.200]  what else do you see in that cocktail it could be anything and sometimes it's the
[02:39:41.200 --> 02:39:47.520]  last thing you think up I mean these people spend 24 seven using foundations
[02:39:47.520 --> 02:39:55.600]  and think tanks counterintelligence operations wargame computer simulators
[02:39:55.600 --> 02:40:01.680]  everything you can think of they have a tremendous advantage over us we have to
[02:40:01.680 --> 02:40:07.720]  wait for them to act too we get a standby and wait for them to blow something up
[02:40:07.720 --> 02:40:14.080]  or whatever they're going to do and then we have to find a path to expose what
[02:40:14.080 --> 02:40:20.160]  they've done and at the same time stop what they've done and so we have a very
[02:40:20.160 --> 02:40:25.720]  very difficult job and we get to be laughed at the whole time but you know
[02:40:25.720 --> 02:40:30.000]  that didn't happen any more Bob I mean that 9% approval writing for Congress
[02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:36.120]  you and I have a kid in the first place no I mean I don't mind my armadillos is
[02:40:36.120 --> 02:40:41.760]  what we are and it's pretty tough for them to pierce our armor well yes you're
[02:40:41.760 --> 02:40:45.920]  right I don't mind people attacking me personally in a sick way I enjoy it just
[02:40:45.920 --> 02:40:48.920]  because I like the fact that I don't care what they say about me so it's kind
[02:40:48.920 --> 02:40:52.880]  of an exercise in that and I get what you're saying I don't mind being pillory
[02:40:52.880 --> 02:40:57.640]  but you still get hurt at how mindless they are I mean it's painful to see
[02:40:57.640 --> 02:41:04.680]  people in willful ignorance or willfully collecting for doing what they're doing
[02:41:04.680 --> 02:41:10.960]  and we got a lot of that today yeah there are a lot of people that know what's
[02:41:10.960 --> 02:41:13.440]  going on they just think they're going to go along with it and be on the winning
[02:41:13.440 --> 02:41:17.920]  team I think it is important though that if we do turn this around that the
[02:41:17.920 --> 02:41:22.200]  people that were involved in it need to be punished because it's important to
[02:41:22.200 --> 02:41:27.160]  send a message to future generations well that's why we have a court system and
[02:41:27.160 --> 02:41:31.920]  if it's not working properly and following the Constitution well we'll
[02:41:31.920 --> 02:41:37.240]  make it work properly and follow the Constitution that's all we ask I mean if
[02:41:37.240 --> 02:41:40.640]  we put them in jail and take there you'll be gotten goods away from them in
[02:41:40.640 --> 02:41:45.280]  their families and give it to the American Treasury that would be a good
[02:41:45.280 --> 02:41:52.960]  thing and all those people who need to be convicted of treason should be and
[02:41:52.960 --> 02:41:58.520]  they should be hung or whatever method they get rid of people like that well
[02:41:58.520 --> 02:42:02.560]  this hidden treason I don't know what is even talking about the fact that they
[02:42:02.560 --> 02:42:08.840]  will bring in QE3 here's CNBC today call for QE member six eight months ago for
[02:42:08.840 --> 02:42:12.200]  those that just joined us the Federal Reserve had Bernanke you know some have
[02:42:12.200 --> 02:42:17.360]  been Bernanke said he wouldn't do that so you know they will call for QE to
[02:42:17.360 --> 02:42:21.400]  stave off euro inflation the reason it's QE3 is they're saying the Federal
[02:42:21.400 --> 02:42:24.800]  Reserve is already contributing but it's going to be made public soon what
[02:42:24.800 --> 02:42:30.080]  effect will that have it'll be monetization and
[02:42:30.080 --> 02:42:36.120]  extremely inflationary it'll buy them under the current numbers that they're
[02:42:36.120 --> 02:42:42.040]  now working with maybe six months maybe here it's hard to tell but there's
[02:42:42.040 --> 02:42:49.160]  another facet to this that people don't understand the Fed is buying assets from
[02:42:49.160 --> 02:42:53.440]  the banks they're buying toxic garbage which are the bonds that contain
[02:42:53.440 --> 02:43:02.440]  mortgages they previously bought from American and foreign banks governments
[02:43:02.440 --> 02:43:10.160]  even corporations 1.4 trillion dollars worth of that garbage so to speak and I
[02:43:10.160 --> 02:43:16.800]  think they're on their way already to purchasing eighty eight hundred a billion
[02:43:16.800 --> 02:43:21.200]  to a trillion more and what will the banks do with that money they will take
[02:43:21.200 --> 02:43:27.640]  it number one and buy treasuries and agencies those are bonds which that
[02:43:27.640 --> 02:43:35.160]  means Treasury won't have to do it and they will also probably start making
[02:43:35.160 --> 02:43:39.120]  loans which they have they've increased loans to small and medium-sized
[02:43:39.120 --> 02:43:42.800]  businesses and they take them the rest of the money and speculate with it
[02:43:42.800 --> 02:43:48.000]  usually leveraged around 30 or 40 to one I was about to say that's the number I
[02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:51.000]  saw even in the Wall Street Journal a couple weeks ago Max Kaiser was
[02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:55.840]  pointing out we pull the article up while he was on air that speculation
[02:43:55.840 --> 02:44:02.120]  compared to 2008 when it hit its last height you know in about October that
[02:44:02.120 --> 02:44:06.240]  it's something like 30% higher than it's ever been so they're they're they're
[02:44:06.240 --> 02:44:12.360]  selling more derivatives more crud than ever that's right and as big profits
[02:44:12.360 --> 02:44:17.640]  because there's no collateralization it's a pure gambling concedo special in
[02:44:17.640 --> 02:44:26.520]  the other house they write the things and if they're wrong they get a pay but
[02:44:26.520 --> 02:44:31.040]  they never wrong a good example is the six hundred and seventy billion dollars
[02:44:31.040 --> 02:44:36.320]  worth of derivatives that call CDS's which are credit default swaps that were
[02:44:36.320 --> 02:44:43.160]  written and sold most of which and this last six months to European bankers so
[02:44:43.160 --> 02:44:49.280]  they can't afford to have any of these people go out of business like grease
[02:44:49.280 --> 02:44:55.400]  etc. and so that's why the money's coming for it don't forget the Fed
[02:44:55.400 --> 02:45:02.000]  supplying the money the Fed is owned by the banks that is supplying the
[02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:07.960]  insurance the CDS that the whole game is rigged
[02:45:07.960 --> 02:45:16.280]  well said Bob Chapman the international forecaster.com if people want

[02:45:44.400 --> 02:45:48.480]  Wellin as I always say we'll see you back here next Friday well thank you very
[02:45:48.480 --> 02:45:52.640]  much and thank you all for listening bye bye Bob good to have you here okay
[02:45:52.640 --> 02:46:03.640]  look some days I am fired up and focused other days I get pretty angry today
[02:46:03.640 --> 02:46:07.040]  I've been all over the map because I tended to come in and take a lot of calls
[02:46:07.040 --> 02:46:23.680]  and cover the news and I don't want to sit here in wine it's just disgusting to
[02:46:23.680 --> 02:46:37.840]  watch good people not even think about the fact that they have a place in
[02:46:37.840 --> 02:46:43.480]  history to shape the world I mean I think it comes down to that most people I
[02:46:43.480 --> 02:46:49.080]  know just think of the mall and the woods and the highway and their cars and
[02:46:49.080 --> 02:46:54.640]  their wife their kids their husband that's just things like none of it even
[02:46:54.640 --> 02:47:00.040]  matters and life doesn't mean anything and they talk about how life's empty
[02:47:00.040 --> 02:47:05.520]  life is incredibly full full of good the bad and the ugly this is a beautiful
[02:47:05.520 --> 02:47:10.360]  country a beautiful planet there are so many good people we're defending the
[02:47:10.360 --> 02:47:19.840]  good we're protecting the good and that is such a sacred honor that is such a
[02:47:19.840 --> 02:47:30.320]  lofty responsibility the world is so full of wonderment and I myself am so
[02:47:30.320 --> 02:47:36.280]  blessed to even be alive in it and I have all these countless thoughts and
[02:47:36.280 --> 02:47:39.880]  understandings and points I want to make and I guess there's an underlying
[02:47:39.880 --> 02:47:43.800]  frustration I do a decent job on there overall but I could do such a better job
[02:47:43.800 --> 02:47:48.880]  and I asked God to help me and you know I know over the years I've never made an
[02:47:48.880 --> 02:47:54.920]  secret the fact that I'm a Christian and have a relationship with God and a lot
[02:47:54.920 --> 02:47:57.880]  of worldly people think that's a funny joke and I guess that's why they don't
[02:47:57.880 --> 02:48:02.960]  have any discernment but I've never really you know sat here and pushed my
[02:48:02.960 --> 02:48:08.600]  ideas it's just that as things get worse and worse I get closer and closer to
[02:48:08.600 --> 02:48:16.120]  God and as I learn more and more about evil it's it's it's it's it's so much
[02:48:16.120 --> 02:48:21.440]  more that I know I can even grasp and when I realize that the general public
[02:48:21.440 --> 02:48:27.760]  is basically asleep I just can't imagine what it's like to be totally asleep to
[02:48:27.760 --> 02:48:33.720]  this stuff all it's going on all around you because we have been eased into this
[02:48:33.720 --> 02:48:39.360]  this bucket of water with the flame under it this pot and now the water is
[02:48:39.360 --> 02:48:46.200]  just boiling and every time I see families with innocent sweet little
[02:48:46.200 --> 02:48:50.760]  children my instincts my spirit my soul wants to protect them wants them to have
[02:48:50.760 --> 02:48:55.360]  a great future once you know they say the children are like a arrow that you
[02:48:55.360 --> 02:48:59.320]  fire from above by the time they're about 13 or 14 you know you've released the
[02:48:59.320 --> 02:49:04.640]  arrow and now it's how you aim it it's it's it's it's you know it's that steady
[02:49:04.640 --> 02:49:08.680]  shot and you release them from the bow and they're free forever out into the
[02:49:08.680 --> 02:49:13.000]  universe and the innocent it's the innocence of children who are in the
[02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:22.800]  garden they are so innocent they are so simple they are so good and I see them
[02:49:22.800 --> 02:49:26.920]  just turned over to the TV turned over to the culture turned over to Madison
[02:49:26.920 --> 02:49:32.840]  Avenue and being a wrecked and I see what multi generations of people turned
[02:49:32.840 --> 02:49:40.120]  over to this of what they've been turned into and all I know is we've got to
[02:49:40.120 --> 02:49:45.320]  pray for an awakening in this country and again even if you don't believe in
[02:49:45.320 --> 02:49:49.760]  spiritual things meditate on it I mean think about it sit down in a chair with
[02:49:49.760 --> 02:49:54.480]  the music off and the TV off and nobody at home and think about the world for an
[02:49:54.480 --> 02:50:01.840]  hour think about the things that are going on I mean we all know from history
[02:50:01.840 --> 02:50:06.160]  books and in the news that checkpoints and military on the streets and
[02:50:06.160 --> 02:50:11.840]  political people being arrested in free speech under attack we know that's the
[02:50:11.840 --> 02:50:17.920]  bad countries and everything that is textbook bad country is now coming here
[02:50:17.920 --> 02:50:24.760]  and we're doing it bigger and better the American way and we know all this
[02:50:24.760 --> 02:50:30.160]  isn't being done for security we know the financial interest that have hijacked
[02:50:30.160 --> 02:50:37.160]  this country wrap everything they do in the flag their whole agenda and they
[02:50:37.160 --> 02:50:42.040]  are funding the terrorist people say well why would the government do that as
[02:50:42.040 --> 02:50:47.560]  a pretext to take over society to get the no bid contracts to secure their
[02:50:47.560 --> 02:50:51.960]  criminal gains I mean it's so simple why do adults even need to have it
[02:50:51.960 --> 02:50:55.360]  explained to them I know you know better than I did we've got to get this
