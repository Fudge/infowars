[00:00.000 --> 00:18.560]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well
[00:18.560 --> 00:30.360]  so does he live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones while gullible
[00:30.360 --> 00:47.920]  Americans fight a war with each other based on lies and those lies poison
[00:47.920 --> 00:52.600]  democratic process that is coming apart at the seams portland these these
[00:52.600 --> 00:56.320]  people riot every night they they go they get their mugshot and then they
[00:56.320 --> 01:00.200]  get put right back on the street to do it again that's what we don't want what
[01:00.200 --> 01:04.120]  we want to say is you know the difference between going out and doing
[01:04.120 --> 01:07.680]  first amendment stuff which obviously we all support it's it's it's part of
[01:07.680 --> 01:11.800]  being american the minute you harm somebody else or you harm somebody's
[01:11.800 --> 01:16.720]  property or you do those types of things the only way we're gonna put a stop to
[01:16.720 --> 01:20.760]  it is to have very swift penalties for it and I was speaking to this young
[01:20.760 --> 01:26.320]  person from arizona who's trying to fight at speed 1070 and I was he he
[01:26.320 --> 01:31.040]  great grab the book and he said it's like mal's red book and I was like man
[01:31.040 --> 01:34.960]  that's what I was thinking if this country doesn't give us what we want
[01:34.960 --> 01:40.520]  then we will burn down this system and replace it all right and I could be
[01:40.520 --> 01:45.040]  speaking visit fit figuratively I could be speaking literally it's a matter of
[01:45.040 --> 01:51.160]  interpretation COVID-19 dr. Fauci's gain of function research biological weapon
[01:51.160 --> 01:56.200]  was just the beginning but we have to ask dr. Fauci is why did he in
[01:56.200 --> 02:01.040]  overseeing these labs allowed gain of function why is he allowing labs to get
[02:01.040 --> 02:05.680]  government money to upgrade animal viruses so they can infect humans it
[02:05.680 --> 02:10.720]  does boggle your mind that Anthony Fauci continued to apparently fund gain of
[02:10.720 --> 02:16.960]  function research and cooperate with the Wuhan lab knowing he had no full
[02:16.960 --> 02:21.520]  wealth of the Wuhan lab just about any organization in China is connected to
[02:21.520 --> 02:27.640]  the Communist Party of China as well as the People's Liberation Army so what
[02:27.640 --> 02:32.440]  were we doing cooperating with China the lie directs is an incredibly powerful
[02:32.440 --> 02:36.560]  political weapon used by totalitarian regimes but the big lie is out there and
[02:36.560 --> 02:40.840]  the people who are one way or the other captive by Chinese political and
[02:40.840 --> 02:44.520]  economic and other pressures have to tow the line and if they didn't support
[02:44.520 --> 02:48.200]  that kind of story they're not members of the big China Club according to a
[02:48.200 --> 02:51.920]  document obtained by the US State Department and first reported by the
[02:51.920 --> 02:57.040]  investigative journalism of the Australian 18 Chinese People's Liberation
[02:57.040 --> 03:01.520]  Army scientists and health officials examined the weaponization of SARS
[03:01.520 --> 03:07.280]  viruses five years before the COVID-19 pandemic predicting a third world war
[03:07.280 --> 03:12.600]  would be fought with biological weapons in an update to the document in 2018
[03:12.600 --> 03:17.240]  published in numerous international publications the Chinese military
[03:17.240 --> 03:22.560]  scientists had found four new pathogens and ten new bacteria while more than
[03:22.560 --> 03:29.520]  1640 new viruses were discovered using metagenomics technology the document
[03:29.520 --> 03:34.440]  claims that bio weapons will be the core weapon for victory in a third world
[03:34.440 --> 03:39.840]  war and then goes on to lay out the ideal conditions to release a bio weapon
[03:39.840 --> 03:44.640]  and cause maximum damage stating that the bio weapons should be released at
[03:44.640 --> 03:49.800]  night or at dawn dusk or under cloudy weather with a stable wind direction so
[03:49.800 --> 03:54.160]  that the aerosol can float into the target area resulting in a surge of
[03:54.160 --> 03:59.440]  hospital treatment causing the enemy's medical system to collapse an exhausted
[03:59.440 --> 04:04.840]  medical system already tested under COVID-19 and ultimately overseen by the
[04:04.840 --> 04:11.280]  Chinese ally the World Health Organization John Bowne reporting
[04:11.280 --> 04:37.080]  Ladies and gentlemen it is Monday May 10th years 2021 and everything we've
[04:37.080 --> 04:41.720]  told you is gonna be unfolding is now unfolding even mainstream news is
[04:41.720 --> 04:46.800]  admitting that we are basically already in a covert war with communist China
[04:46.800 --> 04:54.960]  World War 3 began in late 2019 when Bill Gates Fauci and the other globalist
[04:54.960 --> 04:59.480]  cohorts launched the bio attack against America and President Trump they must go
[04:59.480 --> 05:04.360]  to prison listeners have rightfully been complaining the last six months or so
[05:04.360 --> 05:09.240]  saying where are most of the best-selling products you have that we love and my
[05:09.240 --> 05:13.640]  answer is the supply chain has broken down I have to either reformulate or I
[05:13.640 --> 05:17.080]  have to lower the quality to get a lot of these and so that's why we don't have
[05:17.080 --> 05:20.720]  a lot of products in that's why info wars is in financial trouble is because if
[05:20.720 --> 05:24.120]  we had the product you would be buying it we have the money but so many of them
[05:24.120 --> 05:27.680]  have been sold out just like you notice a lot of other items at the store aren't
[05:27.680 --> 05:33.000]  available because civilization is being artificially imploded but finally x2 is
[05:33.000 --> 05:37.480]  back in stock the good halogen deep earth crystal iodide so essential in your
[05:37.480 --> 05:42.240]  body it's really the missing link it's 50% off we got a big shipment of it at
[05:42.240 --> 05:45.560]  infowarstore.com now when it gets ready to sell out we'll have to go back to near
[05:45.560 --> 05:49.240]  full price take advantage of this now stock up and don't forget to take your
[05:49.240 --> 05:53.600]  x2 because I have a tendency to forget how great it is not taking myself but
[05:53.600 --> 05:58.080]  when I do stamina libido energy weight loss it's incredible it's a central it's
[05:58.080 --> 06:14.720]  x2 at infowarstore.com
[06:14.720 --> 06:30.560]  info wars tomorrow's news today
[06:44.720 --> 06:57.840]  ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us on this live monday
[06:57.840 --> 07:09.960]  broadcast maintenance 2021 man I am tell you I'm so prepared for this broadcast
[07:09.960 --> 07:14.000]  I'm so ready but I don't know the general public's ready I don't know the
[07:14.000 --> 07:19.720]  general public is in a trance I don't know the general public wants to die I
[07:19.720 --> 07:26.440]  don't know the general public wants to live but I know I do and I know that
[07:26.440 --> 07:29.880]  I'm aware of what's going on and I understand what's happening and I know
[07:29.880 --> 07:37.720]  how to beat these people I've studied their philosophy their ways how these
[07:37.720 --> 07:51.920]  globalists operate and I'm gonna do my best today to lay all of this out for
[07:51.920 --> 08:05.080]  you but I can't do it right now I got too angry at the start of the show so I've
[08:05.080 --> 08:15.520]  learned to control my anger I control it right now and I've got a lot of really
[08:15.520 --> 08:21.480]  important special reports right here for everybody that's what we're gonna air
[08:21.480 --> 08:27.440]  here today then I'm gonna try to restart the show the next segment do the best
[08:27.440 --> 08:44.280]  job I can you know we don't just sit up here on this show and rattle stuff off
[08:50.200 --> 08:56.720]  the public really is being attacked by a fear weapon and the public really is
[08:56.720 --> 09:07.720]  being exterminated by these so-called vaccines and that's all a real thing and
[09:07.720 --> 09:13.960]  we do have obviously the giant news of the Communist Chinese and what is
[09:13.960 --> 09:20.280]  unfolding there right now and how that's all coming out and exactly what's going
[09:20.280 --> 09:23.840]  on with that because I don't want to aid and abet the globalist I want to
[09:23.840 --> 09:35.920]  accurately tell you specifically what is unfolding and what is happening because
[09:35.920 --> 09:45.680]  it's very specific and I figured it out in fact I even predicted it and if
[09:45.680 --> 09:54.080]  people can simply understand the philosophy of the globalist we can turn
[09:54.080 --> 10:03.280]  this around and we can stop it but if we don't get conscious and don't get
[10:03.280 --> 10:12.680]  aware and don't turn our minds on then we are obsolete and we will be killed and
[10:12.680 --> 10:24.080]  it's really that simple and so to cover little side issues that are all very
[10:24.080 --> 10:30.600]  interesting and all very entertaining is destructive because then people fill
[10:30.600 --> 10:36.560]  their minds with all of this confetti instead of the real central move that's
[10:36.560 --> 10:40.760]  going on and who the power structures of the world are and what those power
[10:40.760 --> 10:47.320]  bases are doing and the fact that there are different factions inside the New
[10:47.320 --> 10:52.600]  World Order who want the systems of control but don't want different camps
[10:52.600 --> 11:01.920]  to have control and so that's why you see the schizophrenic type machinations
[11:01.920 --> 11:06.880]  that are unfolding so I'm going to try again when we come back to come out of
[11:06.880 --> 11:17.200]  the gates and lay this out but let me do something really important right up
[11:17.200 --> 11:23.200]  front here at the beginning of the transmission so that we can stay on
[11:23.200 --> 11:29.000]  air so we can get that job done I could have an overhead shot right here that
[11:29.000 --> 11:37.640]  would be grand thank you prices are rising everywhere you look our precious
[11:37.640 --> 11:41.040]  CNN is very gleeful over that they also tell you're gonna have a third less
[11:41.040 --> 11:45.320]  gasoline in the summer again their plan to destroy us is going quite nicely
[11:45.320 --> 11:55.080]  higher prices leave consumers feeling the pinch Wall Street Journal what will
[11:55.080 --> 11:59.880]  you do when inflation forces households to spend 40% of their incomes on food
[11:59.880 --> 12:08.880]  zero hedge you ask declare a state of emergency to keep gasoline flowing after
[12:08.880 --> 12:13.880]  colonial fails to restart hacked pipeline
[12:17.840 --> 12:23.080]  why gas prices are already spiking not why they're gonna be spiking soon
[12:23.080 --> 12:28.720]  automakers are ditching high-tech features amidst unprecedented semi
[12:28.720 --> 12:39.840]  shortage but don't worry Bezos has a new 417 foot yacht super yacht the testament
[12:39.840 --> 12:43.600]  to the k-shaped recovery I'm explaining why that's so important not that we're
[12:43.600 --> 12:48.880]  envious of nice things that's what a complex economy has in it but because
[12:48.880 --> 12:53.080]  they are getting richer while we are getting poorer and that's not a good
[12:53.080 --> 12:58.960]  system we're gonna be looking at that coming up and what am I getting at here
[12:58.960 --> 13:09.640]  right now but what I'm getting at here is that it's a fact that if you pay
[13:09.640 --> 13:16.880]  billions of people to stay home and not work that then productivity falls all
[13:16.880 --> 13:21.400]  over the world and people at its assistance level we're already paying
[13:21.400 --> 13:28.120]  50 to 70% of what they earn on food or medicine dying and then those of us here
[13:28.120 --> 13:35.920]  in the West becoming very very poor and sliding down towards where they are and
[13:35.920 --> 13:39.480]  that's what the great reset is that's the plan depopulation by any means and
[13:39.480 --> 13:42.440]  they've done a fabulous job tens of millions extra starved to death the
[13:42.440 --> 13:49.920]  last 16 months global birth rates went way down and that's really their goal
[13:49.920 --> 13:54.720]  but that's the excuse for the total power and total control so you have until
[13:54.720 --> 13:58.120]  Wednesday and I think it's a very smart investment of insurance that you can a
[13:58.120 --> 14:01.960]  hundred percent use and eat to get high-quality swarble food at prepare
[14:01.960 --> 14:07.520]  the Alex calm then you get that box checked off you beat the inflation it's
[14:07.520 --> 14:11.520]  already here and much worse obviously coming and you have again food for you
[14:11.520 --> 14:14.480]  and your family they have three months six months your supply they have a lot
[14:14.480 --> 14:20.160]  of different spectrums of combinations over 300 plus different types of food
[14:20.160 --> 14:25.320]  they've got everything and it is delicious some of it is gourmet the rest
[14:25.320 --> 14:29.040]  of it's just good but compared to other swarble food that's twice the price it
[14:29.040 --> 14:33.040]  is way better and it's what I use for my family but I've got stockpile here at
[14:33.040 --> 14:37.160]  the office we've got generators we've got everything because we know the post
[14:37.160 --> 14:40.760]  industrial world is here and if we're not successful turning this around it's
[14:40.760 --> 14:47.040]  just going to get worse because that's how you control people in the future is
[14:47.040 --> 14:50.920]  you take everything they've got away from them to bring them to their knees
[14:50.920 --> 14:55.720]  it's very simple it's called feudalism it's called serfdom it's called siege so
[14:55.720 --> 15:00.760]  you have until Wednesday to get last year's prices now 10% off the full
[15:00.760 --> 15:05.000]  spectrum of my patriot supply only at prepare that looks calm that's a sub
[15:05.000 --> 15:11.520]  page at info wars.com they also have the Alexa pure pro water filtration systems
[15:11.520 --> 15:15.320]  those are all discounted as well and of course their air filtration system is
[15:15.320 --> 15:19.520]  excellent all of those are sold at info wars.com at the lowest price you're
[15:19.520 --> 15:22.280]  going to find anywhere all the competitors have already gone way up on
[15:22.280 --> 15:26.400]  their prices and they're gonna have to go up soon but this is last year's prices
[15:26.400 --> 15:30.840]  I would take advantage of it now this is a no-brainer and it funds the info war
[15:30.840 --> 15:35.240]  infowarstore.com though we have to sell a lot of it to get a small percentage of
[15:35.240 --> 15:38.640]  it's not a lot of profit in there but we do sell a ton of food
[15:38.640 --> 15:42.640]  up on God because folks are smarter hitting it now we told you a year ago
[15:42.640 --> 15:45.800]  plus this is all coming with the global lockdown it's their admitted plan
[15:45.800 --> 15:50.120]  all right we'll be back with the most important news in the world
[15:52.200 --> 15:56.360]  one of the most popular memes on the internet in the last decade has been
[15:56.360 --> 16:02.160]  Alec Jones was right but it now routinely trends number one on platforms
[16:02.160 --> 16:06.400]  like Twitter and Facebook making the globalists pull their hair out in
[16:06.400 --> 16:09.760]  anger but let me tell you we are tomorrow's news today and thanks for
[16:09.760 --> 16:13.480]  your support we're still on air at info wars.com and Bandai video radio
[16:13.480 --> 16:16.800]  stations and TV stations across the country and our film in game censored and
[16:16.800 --> 16:20.600]  taken offline by Amazon when it hit number one a few years ago it's now
[16:20.600 --> 16:25.040]  available again we have reprinted it high quality DVD in HD it has a zero
[16:25.040 --> 16:28.480]  country code anyone in the world is authorized to make copies of it and I'm
[16:28.480 --> 16:31.360]  asking you to get the original make copies give it to everyone you know
[16:31.360 --> 16:35.200]  air local access TV give it to your pastors your police chiefs your state
[16:35.200 --> 16:38.680]  reps your prime ministers whatever you do warn the world this film uses their own
[16:38.680 --> 16:43.200]  documents and statements 14 years ago to expose them it's more important than
[16:43.200 --> 16:47.160]  ever available at infowarstore.com that's infowarstore.com
[16:47.160 --> 16:57.440]  The equation is very simple the mega banks control the media they control big
[16:57.440 --> 17:03.720]  pharma they control academia they control military industrial complex they
[17:03.720 --> 17:08.840]  control big tech and everywhere that they have been in control in the third
[17:08.840 --> 17:15.080]  world they have established absolute total despotism and dehumanization it is
[17:15.080 --> 17:19.520]  the western christian idea of human freedom that ended slavery and that
[17:19.520 --> 17:23.440]  promoted women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them so
[17:23.440 --> 17:28.320]  because they can't defeat that empowering ethic they instead co-opted
[17:28.320 --> 17:34.280]  turn it upside down and use the idea of equality to actually destroy human
[17:34.280 --> 17:38.400]  freedom and the free market that threatens their monopoly some control
[17:38.400 --> 17:43.000]  that's why they target info wars because we understand the key to defeating
[17:43.000 --> 17:47.360]  them but the only way our transmission gets out is if you promote info wars
[17:47.360 --> 17:52.920]  and bad not video so redouble your efforts we're all on this together
[17:52.920 --> 18:13.280]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[18:22.920 --> 18:37.440]  it's monday may 10th the year is 2021
[18:40.440 --> 18:45.960]  I have a tendency to give you all the data give you all the background and
[18:45.960 --> 18:50.120]  then give you the summation if I ever get to it so let me hear on the alex jones
[18:50.120 --> 18:58.560]  show today at 11 20 central standard time give you the big news now you know
[18:58.560 --> 19:03.320]  last week on day one I said I think this is about bill gates getting ready to go
[19:03.320 --> 19:07.080]  down for being involved in COVID-19 and the poison vaccines the fact that he's
[19:07.080 --> 19:11.800]  so hated and that the jeffrey have seen information he's being blackmailed with
[19:11.800 --> 19:16.640]  that information from pedophilia this is all a giant blackmail war well that's
[19:16.640 --> 19:23.720]  in the wall street journal today next week's news today next year's news
[19:23.720 --> 19:28.720]  today and so much of this is my own wide spectrum research and then my
[19:28.720 --> 19:35.520]  analysis and then pieces of data that are already available to then project
[19:35.520 --> 19:40.560]  forward into the future to understand the most probable reason for something
[19:40.560 --> 19:47.880]  now that was speculation but I was right this will be a very nasty divorce and
[19:47.880 --> 19:56.160]  the split is real in cases and a lot of trouble but there is something much much
[19:56.160 --> 20:05.400]  bigger here so I raised that not to go oh look we were right again I raised that
[20:05.400 --> 20:09.880]  so that when I tell you what I'm about to tell you understand this is not
[20:09.880 --> 20:22.560]  speculation the summation I'm about to tell you is not my opinion but is based
[20:22.560 --> 20:32.080]  on absolute decades of intense research and the fact that the globalist operate
[20:32.080 --> 20:36.040]  like you're an idiot like they're awake and you're asleep and it's like your
[20:36.040 --> 20:40.320]  parents are talking in the front of the car and they think you're asleep in the
[20:40.320 --> 20:43.080]  back of the car as you wake up on that road trip and you hear the most
[20:43.080 --> 20:48.400]  incredible conversation that's happened to most of us hadn't it well see I'm
[20:48.400 --> 20:51.080]  like a kid asleep in the back of the car or the globalist you're talking the
[20:51.080 --> 20:54.480]  front seat I've heard the whole thing
[20:56.120 --> 20:59.760]  fact once literally I was in the backseat of the car when my mom was talking
[20:59.760 --> 21:06.840]  to one of her friends that worked with a three letter agency they were talking
[21:06.840 --> 21:10.240]  about all the DMT and stuff but that's a separate issue I've told that story
[21:10.240 --> 21:17.120]  before but that's a figurative issue when I say it's like being asleep in the
[21:17.120 --> 21:21.280]  back of the car you wake up and hear the conversation I've been watching these
[21:21.280 --> 21:25.800]  people and tracking them and how they operate and they've got a philosophy and
[21:25.800 --> 21:34.560]  an art form to what they do and the people you see at the front level of
[21:34.560 --> 21:43.920]  this the Joe Biden's Hillary Clinton's they are high level but they're not in
[21:43.920 --> 21:50.800]  the policy making actual decision level there's there's a level above them that
[21:50.800 --> 21:55.360]  basically manipulates all these different powerful forces against each
[21:55.360 --> 22:01.320]  other in a dialectic and of course philosopher Hegel the German philosopher
[22:01.320 --> 22:06.400]  did not invent the dialectic he just codified it into a term of what he
[22:06.400 --> 22:12.720]  called the dialectic the dialectics very very simple Bruce Jenner is a total
[22:12.720 --> 22:16.600]  globalist frontman of the deep state he reads off a script he's an actor he's
[22:16.600 --> 22:22.880]  paying to do what he does he dresses up it has a one-trick pony in a dress or in
[22:22.880 --> 22:31.320]  a big bird outfit and says oh I don't think we should have boys and girls
[22:31.320 --> 22:36.040]  sports that's not fair and then when he wants illegal aliens and open borders
[22:36.040 --> 22:42.080]  and gun control we'll accepting because oh he doesn't want men and girls sports
[22:42.080 --> 22:49.840]  that is a dialectic a form of a dialectic the Hegelian dialectic has a
[22:49.840 --> 22:54.960]  lot of subgroups but there's problem reaction solution there's also what you
[22:54.960 --> 23:01.000]  could call the Overton window in it in a Hegelian perspective of oh we want
[23:01.000 --> 23:03.840]  convicted pedophiles that come visit with your children at public school and
[23:03.840 --> 23:09.600]  bounce them on their knee and have men in the showers with little girls and have
[23:09.600 --> 23:14.040]  men and women sports dominating it and he's like no no we'll just take your
[23:14.040 --> 23:20.240]  guns and have open borders and men will say they're women right oh you're our
[23:20.240 --> 23:25.400]  savior you see that's a dialectic so they moved you way over here with oh
[23:25.400 --> 23:28.880]  we're gonna rape your children and world government and Satanism he's like no no
[23:28.880 --> 23:32.160]  no we're just men are just gonna be women and we're gonna have open borders
[23:32.160 --> 23:37.160]  and take your guns right oh then Sean Hannity all the Republicans is
[23:37.160 --> 23:47.440]  sycophantically endorsed Bruce Jenner and it's not even a judgment on a dude
[23:47.440 --> 23:50.760]  wanting to wear a dress it's the fact that he's a front man to confuse
[23:50.760 --> 23:56.000]  everybody and to be the smokescreen for sterilizing little boys and little
[23:56.000 --> 24:00.680]  girls and cutting their genitals off and that's what this movement is and this is
[24:00.680 --> 24:06.400]  a leering snapping turtle creature that is the front of it so so obviously I'm
[24:06.400 --> 24:11.080]  not getting to the big gigantic news this segment and again it's not that I'm
[24:11.080 --> 24:17.280]  even building this up to keep people listening segment to segment this is so
[24:17.280 --> 24:23.920]  big this is so momentous that people like Winston Churchill would take two
[24:23.920 --> 24:28.080]  weeks to write one of his monumental speeches that might be five minutes long
[24:28.080 --> 24:33.880]  well I'm not writing speeches I'm up here chronicling the most dangerous time
[24:33.880 --> 24:40.560]  in human history the most epic stuff while I run this company in this media
[24:40.560 --> 24:45.520]  operation and literally make every decision and I'm not complaining about
[24:45.520 --> 24:53.960]  that it's just that it is not a form of choking to not be able to say all this I
[24:53.960 --> 24:59.960]  know their entire plan I've proven I know their plan I've proven I know their
[24:59.960 --> 25:04.440]  next moves and sometimes I've got blind spots and walk right into their traps
[25:04.440 --> 25:09.680]  all of us have to be watching out for each other but simply put if you will
[25:09.680 --> 25:15.200]  listen to me and if you will take this information and if you will share this
[25:15.200 --> 25:25.120]  information it's game over but I want to explain to people the philosophy of this
[25:25.120 --> 25:29.960]  system and where it's going and what's really happening because can we put on
[25:29.960 --> 25:36.440]  screen folks a great crew that puts up with me today's live show feed that's
[25:36.440 --> 25:40.440]  the new every day I go and create a name of the of the broadcast there it is
[25:40.440 --> 25:46.760]  COVID-19 is a communist Chinese bio weapon and WW3 World War three has
[25:46.760 --> 25:55.360]  already begun now that's a true statement John Bowne had a report World War
[25:55.360 --> 25:59.680]  three is a Chinese bio weapon and I aired that at the start of the show that
[25:59.680 --> 26:03.960]  first few minutes and then made me think how accurate that is because a new
[26:03.960 --> 26:09.040]  World War isn't tanks and airplanes right up front it's it's a virus it's
[26:09.040 --> 26:14.040]  fear it's it's it's collapse of the systems and now we have the Chinese
[26:14.040 --> 26:24.880]  communist document 263 pages of it and it is China it basically admitting they
[26:24.880 --> 26:28.360]  cooked this up in a cactus and it's in mainstream news now now why are they
[26:28.360 --> 26:32.760]  allowing it out I'll explain when we come back because if you understand what
[26:32.760 --> 26:37.320]  I'm about to say you'll understand the whole thing and the same model is
[26:37.320 --> 26:43.720]  duplicated everywhere as above so below so I'm gonna give you the highest level
[26:43.720 --> 26:51.360]  analysis there is not from some secret agency but out of my mind the word
[26:51.360 --> 26:58.960]  apocalypse means the revealing of what was once hidden and now that all the
[26:58.960 --> 27:06.040]  lies are being revealed what will you do you know that millions will do
[27:06.040 --> 27:11.560]  absolutely nothing they will do whatever they are told as if obedience is a
[27:11.560 --> 27:19.360]  virtue it is the Patriots of the world versus everybody else I do solemnly
[27:19.360 --> 27:24.440]  swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States
[27:24.440 --> 27:30.240]  against all enemies foreign and domestic that I will bear true faith and
[27:30.240 --> 27:35.920]  allegiance to the same that I take this obligation freely without any mental
[27:35.920 --> 27:41.520]  reservation for purpose of evasion and that I will well and faithfully discharge
[27:41.520 --> 27:46.840]  my duties as best as I can so help me God info wars.com
[27:46.840 --> 27:53.920]  Benz dot video Gerald and South Carolina go ahead you're on the air trying to
[27:53.920 --> 27:58.000]  move quicker hey Alex welcome would like to say first off thanks for being the
[27:58.000 --> 28:01.960]  voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity wanted to warn people I've
[28:01.960 --> 28:06.360]  been trying to get a hold of you for a year okay I'm a double amputee and I
[28:06.360 --> 28:11.440]  have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away living defense
[28:11.440 --> 28:16.360]  saved my life they had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me
[28:16.360 --> 28:21.360]  living defense brought me back I wanted to just quote from the Bible Jesus is
[28:21.360 --> 28:26.960]  saying as to where we are right now this is Matthew 24 verse 9 then they shall
[28:26.960 --> 28:33.320]  deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all
[28:33.320 --> 28:38.520]  nations for my name's sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray
[28:38.520 --> 28:42.680]  one another and shall hate one another that's right where we're at brother and
[28:42.680 --> 28:46.240]  that's because God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what
[28:46.240 --> 28:51.960]  they say and that's why the enemy hates it because God created this country 14
[28:51.960 --> 28:56.360]  months ago I told you that the global lockdown was gonna kill tens of
[28:56.360 --> 29:00.000]  millions of people by starvation and was gonna cause a global depression in the
[29:00.000 --> 29:04.040]  first world and now it has it was a no-brainer then that you should get
[29:04.040 --> 29:08.920]  high-quality storeable food and save it because it is insurance you can eat and
[29:08.920 --> 29:13.320]  with all the inflation we knew was coming that was one way to be inflation a
[29:13.320 --> 29:17.240]  lot of you listened you did a great job some of you didn't now is the time to
[29:17.240 --> 29:21.720]  take action before food prices only continue to increase every index shows
[29:21.720 --> 29:26.320]  it it's basically a guarantee barring a miracle and we wish it wasn't the case
[29:26.320 --> 29:30.720]  but let's make lemonade out of these limits for only a few days more until
[29:30.720 --> 29:37.320]  next Wednesday May 12th you can get 2020 prices still at preparewithalex.com

[29:54.560 --> 29:59.160]  when the first world collapses the third world dies we have such a complex
[29:59.160 --> 30:03.640]  civilization with so many billions of moving parts that when you shut down the
[30:03.640 --> 30:08.200]  first world it causes a chain reaction that will devastate the third world and
[30:08.200 --> 30:12.040]  really hurt the first world well now you're hearing about gas shortages all
[30:12.040 --> 30:15.400]  over the United States that's because the companies and the systems and the
[30:15.400 --> 30:19.440]  drivers that can barely get the job done before delivering gas have been shut
[30:19.440 --> 30:22.960]  down plus the Keystone pipeline has been shut down along with other pipelines
[30:22.960 --> 30:28.320]  the left is now blowing up dams across the US we're being shut down our coal
[30:28.320 --> 30:32.400]  power plants are off as well ladies and gentlemen prepare to be a total slave
[30:32.400 --> 30:36.000]  the third world is imploding as well the borders have been removed until you
[30:36.000 --> 30:40.000]  wake up this is a globalist chai-com takeover Gregory said you have no hope
[30:40.000 --> 30:44.600]  they're announcing that there will be less than two-thirds the gas needed this
[30:44.600 --> 30:48.080]  summer so they told you that you're under lockdown one way or another and
[30:48.080 --> 30:51.600]  seeing and laughed at you and your family
[30:53.560 --> 30:59.040]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[30:59.040 --> 31:01.040]  you
[31:01.040 --> 31:23.040]  you for wars the most banned network in the world
[31:31.040 --> 31:42.040]  World War three has begun
[31:47.480 --> 31:59.880]  think about that World War three began in December of the year 2019
[31:59.880 --> 32:11.640]  COVID-19 symbolizes World War three on humanity 2019 all of these words are
[32:11.640 --> 32:16.280]  code words used by the globalist they talk about eradicating the virus they
[32:16.280 --> 32:22.560]  mean eradicating you they talk about getting the virus under control they're
[32:22.560 --> 32:28.760]  talking about you when they talk about this crisis is going to go in a long
[32:28.760 --> 32:33.960]  time till we save the earth and cut the carbon from humans down to zero you
[32:33.960 --> 32:39.360]  exhale carbon dioxide that means kill everyone on earth and when Bill Gates
[32:39.360 --> 32:43.120]  said that at Ted talk they erupted in laughter because they're on the inside
[32:43.120 --> 32:52.680]  club they don't mean themselves they mean you so if we're in World War three
[32:52.680 --> 33:01.120]  who are the players who launched the attack now if you're a regular listener
[33:01.120 --> 33:06.280]  I'm about to say you've already heard in it so many words but now you
[33:06.280 --> 33:11.520]  specifically see it overhead shot please and I'll give you the summation up front
[33:11.520 --> 33:15.960]  before going through all the data China has been preparing for World War three
[33:15.960 --> 33:23.120]  with biological evidence for at least six years US investigators say this is in
[33:23.120 --> 33:26.680]  Reuters this is in the Associated Press this is in the Daily Mail this is in the
[33:26.680 --> 33:33.960]  Wall Street Journal this all broke into the Australian two days ago Chinese
[33:33.960 --> 33:38.240]  military scientists discussed weaponizing SARS coronavirus of the
[33:38.240 --> 33:45.040]  Australian to collapse the US economy from the fear it would create hmm boy the
[33:45.040 --> 33:48.320]  media almost got a memo and really helped them didn't they huh yeah they were
[33:48.320 --> 33:53.760]  locked step that's the actual battle plan evidence reveals the military team
[33:53.760 --> 33:58.840]  collaborated with lab in city where covered 19 pandemic originated epic
[33:58.840 --> 34:06.040]  times a major scholar report by the ISPSW strategic series focus on defense
[34:06.040 --> 34:13.480]  international security why us outsourced back virus research people on and a big
[34:13.480 --> 34:23.680]  abstract report by Dr. Christina Lynn excellent report detailing it all for the
[34:23.680 --> 34:28.640]  Department of Defense Defense there's a Washington Post article I told you was
[34:28.640 --> 34:33.560]  coming to it before it did opinion Congress is finally investigating the lab
[34:33.560 --> 34:40.080]  accident COVID-19 origin story I was told directly by people inside the
[34:40.080 --> 34:43.840]  government that this was going to be breaking and that I would be
[34:43.840 --> 34:49.400]  vindicated three weeks ago and again that was two weeks before this began to
[34:49.400 --> 34:59.640]  break with Josh Rogan on Joe Rogan continuing with the evidence in a
[34:59.640 --> 35:05.360]  moment but first let's talk about what this means why are they coming out and
[35:05.360 --> 35:09.960]  admitting half the story that the Communist Chinese military was running
[35:09.960 --> 35:14.480]  gain-of-function research at the Wuhan lab and that Obama transferred the
[35:14.480 --> 35:20.400]  illegal research from Chapel Hill North Carolina through Anthony Fauci the CDC
[35:20.400 --> 35:26.120]  the NIH and his national organization that deals with quote allergens and
[35:26.120 --> 35:35.560]  allergies to the Wuhan lab in 2015 that was done for plausible deniability and
[35:35.560 --> 35:40.360]  part of a marriage between the United States globalist system and the Chai
[35:40.360 --> 35:47.120]  comm system again Obama put secret black sites in China for torturing and
[35:47.120 --> 35:54.160]  killing with the CIA he did unspeakable crimes against humanity green lit the
[35:54.160 --> 35:59.040]  rounding up of Buddhist Christians and 3 million Uighurs now a lot of that came
[35:59.040 --> 36:02.600]  out the news but a lot of that came out here first including information still
[36:02.600 --> 36:06.240]  not known by the general public that I've risked my life to bring you because
[36:06.240 --> 36:10.280]  that's what it takes not doing that to act tough I'm doing that as an example of
[36:10.280 --> 36:14.520]  how we're gonna defeat these people is stop being cowards now let me give you
[36:14.520 --> 36:24.720]  the big prime analysis you're being told that okay China's involved okay they
[36:24.720 --> 36:29.760]  use this to shut us down okay it's an active war and I'm not defending the
[36:29.760 --> 36:33.480]  communist Chinese I think they should pay for what they've done but let's be
[36:33.480 --> 36:39.400]  clear communist China is a project of the globalist and the Rockefellers and
[36:39.400 --> 36:45.280]  the British royalty and the Rothschilds Mao Zedong was put in power and the
[36:45.280 --> 36:49.320]  deal was that we would be deindustrialized in the West but we would
[36:49.320 --> 36:54.640]  have the military based around a UN army and NATO the US was subserved to that
[36:54.640 --> 36:59.800]  communist China would only have a regional military would not expand except in
[36:59.800 --> 37:03.000]  the area of werth minerals where they would be given a world monopoly which
[37:03.000 --> 37:09.960]  they have a 98% monopoly on via the IMF World Bank and WTO they would then not
[37:09.960 --> 37:16.200]  expand militarily they broke that deal about 12 years ago and so of course
[37:16.200 --> 37:21.320]  you've got this global government forming that agrees on transhumanism the
[37:21.320 --> 37:26.120]  race for immortality they follow the same satanic spirit the same operating
[37:26.120 --> 37:33.160]  system but they're in a race together it's like they're both driving Ford
[37:33.160 --> 37:43.080]  Mustangs at the Daytona race but they're two racers on different teams trying to
[37:43.080 --> 37:47.800]  beat each other so it's the same AI the same eugenics the same chemicals in the
[37:47.800 --> 37:53.400]  water the same sterilization the same one-shot policies the same world social
[37:53.400 --> 37:59.560]  credit score but it's globalists that are already paid off by China some of
[37:59.560 --> 38:04.280]  which are pure agents of China others are double agents others are still loyal
[38:04.280 --> 38:10.280]  Americans and then the real controllers are up above that and knew that they'd
[38:10.280 --> 38:14.600]  build up China knew that China would then try to be have superiority and that in
[38:14.600 --> 38:19.280]  the future we would let China be tricked into attacking us believing we were
[38:19.280 --> 38:23.280]  weak leaving they control the US leadership and then annihilating China
[38:23.280 --> 38:27.320]  just like they did in World War two to the Japanese just like British
[38:27.320 --> 38:31.280]  intelligence set up Hitler gave them all the intel infiltrated as high as order
[38:31.280 --> 38:34.440]  had the king of England sign a treaty with him and then pull the rug out from
[38:34.440 --> 38:43.760]  under him once he invaded France and so the globalists want world government
[38:43.760 --> 38:49.120]  they want death they want control but they wanted to get rid of Trump at a
[38:49.120 --> 38:52.080]  certain level because he wasn't playing ball he was a populist manifestation
[38:52.080 --> 38:55.480]  they wanted to get rid of Bolsonaro they were to get control of people like
[38:55.480 --> 39:01.040]  Morris Johnson so they let China run the drill create the fear had the UN be
[39:01.040 --> 39:03.680]  in command because they want the UN to have a lot of power have global
[39:03.680 --> 39:08.160]  standardization launch the QR codes launch the social credit score launch the
[39:08.160 --> 39:13.720]  global digital approval system and an indigital health pass which swabs now
[39:13.720 --> 39:18.760]  saying when implantable chip out of the scandal cover that next segment but then
[39:18.760 --> 39:23.320]  China and the Chinese faction of the new order push too hard to keep us closed
[39:23.320 --> 39:29.440]  too long they always take advantage and so now oh the massacre of fraud oh now
[39:29.440 --> 39:35.800]  Fauci's involved in Wuhan oh now the Chinese are involved in this as a
[39:35.800 --> 39:41.360]  threat within the globalist deep state now that Trump's gone the same old
[39:41.360 --> 39:44.880]  factions are fighting with each other over control and so they want to have
[39:44.880 --> 39:49.040]  limited information come out to hold it over Xi Jinping to hold over Fauci and
[39:49.040 --> 39:53.160]  now as I said he would Fauci yesterday was saying we'll never reopen today he
[39:53.160 --> 39:56.720]  said okay maybe we should go ahead and reopen and take the mask off even inside
[39:56.720 --> 40:00.480]  businesses because again the globalists want a world lockdown they want a world
[40:00.480 --> 40:04.160]  ID they want world control but they don't want China to run at all but the
[40:04.160 --> 40:08.520]  Chinese factions getting ahead of itself and forgetting destroyed not supposed
[40:08.520 --> 40:12.360]  to get destroyed right now that's in about five to ten years and so the
[40:12.360 --> 40:17.240]  Chinese globalist agents like Gates and Fauci that became China files I mean
[40:17.240 --> 40:21.320]  Gates says China's great America sucks Fauci says the same thing they were
[40:21.320 --> 40:25.520]  compartmentalized and and and thought they were on the winning team and thought
[40:25.520 --> 40:29.560]  they were about to run the tables with China and I was like no no no no no let's
[40:29.560 --> 40:35.800]  stall that back let's send in our bulldog the Australians are ready to go to war
[40:35.800 --> 40:40.680]  right now and as we move in around them but again there's that power control
[40:40.680 --> 40:45.280]  master back there manipulating the whole deal and gauging this and balancing
[40:45.280 --> 40:50.280]  it we're gonna blow that whole system wide open I'll tell you about on the other side

[44:00.920 --> 44:04.040]  care about beating the new world order and it's because we have so much
[44:04.040 --> 44:08.360]  credibility they can't allow us to stay on air much longer and I don't have time
[44:08.360 --> 44:11.480]  to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons I can't tell

[44:49.760 --> 44:53.280]  trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[44:53.280 --> 45:02.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[45:15.680 --> 45:20.000]  Well it broke in the last few days didn't really get any attention before
[45:20.000 --> 45:25.000]  that I didn't know about it turns out Klaus Schwab went on French television
[45:25.000 --> 45:31.480]  during the Davos group meeting in 2016 five years ago and said we're gonna
[45:31.480 --> 45:35.840]  bring in a world government you're gonna have an ID card a global ID card it's
[45:35.840 --> 45:39.000]  first sewn into your clothes or is a wristband and then you're gonna have an
[45:39.000 --> 45:42.400]  implantable chip in you within the next ten years that means within five years
[45:42.400 --> 45:47.120]  from now and he talked about you know using basically a virus to get control
[45:47.120 --> 45:50.720]  the planet he's written books saying that he also wrote the fourth industrial
[45:50.720 --> 45:55.400]  revolution book talking about the end of human labor and humans being obsolete.
[45:55.400 --> 46:00.600]  Yeah the Nazis they were alive today would be salivating and worshiping this
[46:00.600 --> 46:06.040]  guy oh but all the liberal publications tell you how liberal he is like Henry
[46:06.040 --> 46:10.720]  Kissinger who created State Department of Random 200 calling for world
[46:10.720 --> 46:14.920]  government to carry out forced depopulation it's declassified you
[46:14.920 --> 46:22.120]  don't read it online if you like it's admittedly real so here we are we told
[46:22.120 --> 46:29.680]  you I keep saying 14 months times long past we told you in February that they
[46:29.680 --> 46:33.000]  created an artificial virus with gain of function so they could say everybody was
[46:33.000 --> 46:36.720]  guilty because everybody will finally get infected with it and like so many
[46:36.720 --> 46:40.800]  other coronaviruses they could confuse it with other coronaviruses so that it
[46:40.800 --> 46:44.760]  was a problem that could never be fixed and then we learned that if you did a
[46:44.760 --> 46:48.800]  coronavirus vaccine for this type of coronavirus it would cause blood clots
[46:48.800 --> 46:53.280]  and heart problems and Alzheimer's and now that's all over the news and it
[46:53.280 --> 46:58.600]  turns out Fauci did studies in 2012 the University of Texas level four BSL lab
[46:58.600 --> 47:03.880]  and they found that that's what happened when you gave lab rats COVID vaccines it
[47:03.880 --> 47:08.480]  would then give them blood clots heart attacks and lung problems and killed them
[47:08.480 --> 47:13.760]  and so Fauci then got caught creating this at the Chapel Hill North Carolina
[47:13.760 --> 47:18.800]  lab and others so they moved it to Communist China and immediately that
[47:18.800 --> 47:26.440]  merger with China was used at the globalist Bill Gates Fauci level to as
[47:26.440 --> 47:32.640]  Fauci bragged in 2017 oh Trump will be challenged by a new epidemic by a new
[47:32.640 --> 47:39.440]  plague before his first term is out he was bragging the other scientists just
[47:39.440 --> 47:43.360]  like Bill Gates does when he's in front of scientists and talks about other
[47:43.360 --> 47:52.760]  creating GMO mosquitoes and things to sterilize the population they love to
[47:52.760 --> 47:56.760]  brag but above that is a whole nother level they believe China was about to
[47:56.760 --> 48:00.040]  win they believed America would never reopen they have massive investments in
[48:00.040 --> 48:04.640]  China China is the model of authoritarianism and so they want to keep it
[48:04.640 --> 48:08.440]  shut down other factions are like no we're getting the world ID card we're
[48:08.440 --> 48:12.800]  getting the QR codes we're getting the global social credit score the Americans
[48:12.800 --> 48:18.440]  have taken the slavery so well that they're refusing to take their mask off
[48:18.440 --> 48:23.560]  and now none of the schools will even go back and things are totally falling
[48:23.560 --> 48:27.800]  apart we don't want to be defeated that quickly we don't want China to take over
[48:27.800 --> 48:31.600]  right now we just want to China to triple its profits so we triple our
[48:31.600 --> 48:37.040]  profits but we didn't want to finish America off right now and so that's why
[48:37.040 --> 48:40.200]  you're hearing about Fauci in the Wuhan lab and make straight news that's why
[48:40.200 --> 48:43.080]  you're hearing about him funding the bat research the coronavirus and the
[48:43.080 --> 48:46.880]  function research which has all been true hiding in plain view how in the
[48:46.880 --> 48:51.840]  world could you have that info and then have Bill Gates find that big report
[48:51.840 --> 48:56.000]  put out by his foundations of city area saying if someone says that it might
[48:56.000 --> 49:03.640]  have come out of Wuhan we need to use the CIA on them remember that report here
[49:03.640 --> 49:10.160]  it is right here the disinformation doesn't my platforms must act on 12
[49:10.160 --> 49:18.120]  leading online anti-vaxxers that says they want to use the CIA and the FBI on
[49:18.120 --> 49:24.320]  them and arrest people and you know if they say it came out of Wuhan get them
[49:24.320 --> 49:29.920]  they're watching for those that those doctors that criticize them no you can't
[49:29.920 --> 49:37.720]  let those doctors talk in America right out of communist China and so when I
[49:37.720 --> 49:40.400]  say hey look how we were right about this again it's not about oh look we're so
[49:40.400 --> 49:43.880]  smart it's look there's a lot of BS out there there's a lot of disinformation
[49:43.880 --> 49:48.360]  out there we've really studied the controllers of the planet and the
[49:48.360 --> 49:53.000]  different factions and we know how they work we know there's different camps and
[49:53.000 --> 49:57.920]  so it is a big big deal though that the Australian military released this
[49:57.920 --> 50:01.280]  document the Chinese aren't even denying it it's not really a secret
[50:01.280 --> 50:09.520]  document it's just a high-level Chinese War College analysis about releasing a
[50:09.520 --> 50:15.480]  coronavirus gain of function to overwhelm not just the hospitals but to
[50:15.480 --> 50:21.360]  overwhelm the whole society so they went with a Chinese plan of overwhelming the
[50:21.360 --> 50:24.400]  hospitals but they weren't really overwhelmed locking all the rest of
[50:24.400 --> 50:29.320]  society down so the hospitals wouldn't be overwhelmed you always see how
[50:29.320 --> 50:34.840]  there's disinfo within the disinfo and the Communist Chinese know they were
[50:34.840 --> 50:41.840]  put in power by David Rockefeller and Henry Kissinger they know America was
[50:41.840 --> 50:46.240]  double-crossed and sold out to them and they've been feeling their oats they've
[50:46.240 --> 50:50.040]  got a little big for their britches and they've really started pushing the
[50:50.040 --> 50:53.800]  globalists around and the globalists didn't want Trump to be the guy to do
[50:53.800 --> 50:57.000]  that so they removed him but now they're right back to fighting with the
[50:57.000 --> 51:02.360]  Chinese and that power split is very real but they but we've got double agents
[51:02.360 --> 51:08.080]  in both camps but China is a good place to carry out criminal action against the
[51:08.080 --> 51:12.080]  US criminal hacks like you see with the pipeline on the East Coast the rest of
[51:12.080 --> 51:16.600]  it so the globalists have plausible deniability because in the end the
[51:16.600 --> 51:19.840]  globalists are targeting every nation-state and every power structure
[51:19.840 --> 51:24.960]  until they get their one controlling AI computer system that they program with
[51:24.960 --> 51:30.360]  armies of robots and once that balance of power tips towards the robots then the
[51:30.360 --> 51:35.320]  real electromagnetic systems are going to be released where they can make the
[51:35.320 --> 51:38.120]  general public just all go crazy and start killing each other that's one
[51:38.120 --> 51:41.720]  plan on the on the shelf they've already tested you saw them in the Kingsman kind
[51:41.720 --> 51:47.280]  of turn that into a cartoon style deal and you also have them with the
[51:47.280 --> 51:52.840]  biological race specifics and they've just got a lot of different things again
[51:52.840 --> 52:00.360]  on the shelf ladies and gentlemen and so by putting the research facility at a
[52:00.360 --> 52:05.920]  US funded UN funded Chinese lab there could be plausible deniability because
[52:05.920 --> 52:09.840]  it was just a military lab in China we'd have to go to war with them it was a US
[52:09.840 --> 52:13.560]  lab Chapel Hill they go to war with us but instead they wanted to release this
[52:13.560 --> 52:17.000]  on everybody to give the UN and the globalist power so they did it out of
[52:17.000 --> 52:24.640]  that demilitarized zone that DMZ of labs where 12 programs were being funded by
[52:24.640 --> 52:29.920]  Bill Gates alone all the coronavirus gain a function foul she in control the
[52:29.920 --> 52:35.320]  fat checkers for Facebook working on the virus itself all one criminal group to
[52:35.320 --> 52:40.280]  manage and run the whole thing but they took advantage of it they never wanted
[52:40.280 --> 52:44.040]  the US to reopen they wanted all that power in control they decided that
[52:44.040 --> 52:48.640]  China's time had come well the globalist aren't done toying with both sides yet
[52:48.640 --> 52:56.680]  and so now China's being put back in its place because they do have Biden they do
[52:56.680 --> 53:00.280]  control Biden but you're noticing they're just like Trump couldn't get stuff done
[53:00.280 --> 53:05.320]  Biden's only getting the stuff done the globalist want getting rid of the
[53:05.320 --> 53:10.440]  borders getting an electorate in that they control a permanent underclass all
[53:10.440 --> 53:15.640]  that's going ahead that's globalism but some of the other things Biden wants
[53:15.640 --> 53:22.440]  some other things the chai comms want they're not going to get and so understand
[53:22.440 --> 53:25.040]  we just have the chai comms to deal with we could defeat them very easily
[53:25.040 --> 53:29.080]  economically culturally they've been propped up they're a joke but the new
[53:29.080 --> 53:32.880]  world order wants communism to succeed somewhere kind of a fascist corporate
[53:32.880 --> 53:36.040]  crony model of it so they could export it around the world that's what really
[53:36.040 --> 53:41.200]  happened but our real threat is the globalist and their sophistication and
[53:41.200 --> 53:44.200]  how they fund all the different points of the compass they're able to get
[53:44.200 --> 53:47.440]  control of what they don't control is you the populist in your relationship with
[53:47.440 --> 53:50.200]  Jesus Christ and that's why they're attacking churches all over the world
[53:50.200 --> 53:53.080]  trying to shut them down while everything else has been reopened is
[53:53.080 --> 53:56.320]  because at the end of the day that is their enemy this is good versus evil and
[53:56.320 --> 54:02.840]  there is an evil entity that is very very ancient and very very cunning and
[54:02.840 --> 54:07.640]  that has the models of control called Satan that is manipulating this whole
[54:07.640 --> 54:12.960]  thing but World War three against the family against the nation-state against
[54:12.960 --> 54:16.880]  wealth against our health began by the global technocracy that's a medical
[54:16.880 --> 54:22.400]  based tyranny to end the human species as we know it and depopulate us and
[54:22.400 --> 54:31.080]  they've taken over the entire medical system of the world and are bearing down
[54:31.080 --> 54:34.520]  on us very very quickly and so it doesn't matter if we're Chinese or Mexican or
[54:34.520 --> 54:40.480]  from the United States or from Russia or from Calcutta India we are all in this
[54:40.480 --> 54:43.000]  together we better figure out there's this scientific
[54:43.000 --> 54:46.760]  technocracy playing him out of the off against itself and if we don't wake up
[54:46.760 --> 54:50.120]  and transcend that and say no to it then they believe they have a right to slowly
[54:50.120 --> 54:54.920]  destroy us and test all these biologicals on us to extract the Lazarus

[57:44.120 --> 57:49.520]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[57:49.520 --> 58:09.200]  all right John Bowne already saw one powerful report today about the fact
[58:09.200 --> 58:12.600]  that World War three really has begun it's economic it's fear-based it's
[58:12.600 --> 58:17.720]  biological based and it's the globalist waging war on humanity itself through
[58:17.720 --> 58:21.320]  the nation stated through other systems through the medical system but he's
[58:21.320 --> 58:24.160]  followed another report I'm gonna come back again to the economic news the
[58:24.160 --> 58:31.280]  pipeline still shut off and a lot more here is the latest report China inches
[58:31.280 --> 58:34.960]  closer to world domination well yeah that is the globalist through the
[58:34.960 --> 58:40.440]  Chinese inch closer to world domination China in league with the New World Order
[58:40.440 --> 58:46.040]  Chinese century think tanks is preparing a full-scale depopulation strategy to
[58:46.040 --> 58:50.200]  stomp out freedom and replace it with global communist enslavement we've
[58:50.200 --> 58:54.600]  been learning that one of the things that the Chinese are doing to advance
[58:54.600 --> 59:00.320]  this global ambition of theirs is to take out the United States of America
[59:00.320 --> 59:06.560]  because we're the only impediment really to realizing those goals and one of
[59:06.560 --> 59:11.440]  the most insidious of the ways in which China is waging what it has called what
[59:11.440 --> 59:19.960]  it has declared is people's war against this country and that it uses the so
[59:19.960 --> 59:28.320]  called unrestricted warfare techniques to achieve is perhaps the most insidious
[59:28.320 --> 59:33.560]  of those techniques and you mentioned it influence operations the Chinese
[59:33.560 --> 59:37.560]  Communist Party deploys dollars just as much as it does cloaks and daggers to
[59:37.560 --> 59:44.360]  get its hands on valuable knowledge there are many American scholars often
[59:44.360 --> 59:47.880]  doing research funded by American taxpayers that have been lured into the
[59:47.880 --> 59:53.000]  Chinese Communist Party's talent recruitment programs the CCP pays them
[59:53.000 --> 59:58.360]  what is for them a fortune to do research related to the current fields for
[59:58.360 --> 1:00:02.200]  or in China and then often uses the fruits of their brain power to build
[1:00:02.200 --> 1:00:06.040]  its military strength what the American people have to understand is all the
[1:00:06.040 --> 1:00:10.560]  data that goes into those mobile apps that kids have so much fun with and
[1:00:10.560 --> 1:00:14.840]  seems so convenient it goes right to servers in China right to the Chinese
[1:00:14.840 --> 1:00:19.160]  military the Chinese Communist Party and the agencies which want to steal our
[1:00:19.160 --> 1:00:23.160]  intellectual property those apps can be used to steal personal and financial
[1:00:23.160 --> 1:00:27.120]  information for blackmail and extortion they can be used to steal business
[1:00:27.120 --> 1:00:31.560]  intellectual property and proprietary secrets the Chinese won't play by the
[1:00:31.560 --> 1:00:35.960]  standard rules of warfare until Western civilization has been essentially
[1:00:35.960 --> 1:00:41.600]  prepped for invasion the guy who now runs the Central Intelligence Agency is a
[1:00:41.600 --> 1:00:47.000]  longtime Foreign Service officer by the name of Bill Burns Bill Burns until he
[1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:52.880]  took this job ran the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace Bill Burns was
[1:00:52.880 --> 1:00:58.880]  a guy who enabled Chinese influence operations at the Carnegie Endowment
[1:00:58.880 --> 1:01:05.360]  Bill Burns lied to Senator Marco Rubio and the Senate Intelligence Committee
[1:01:05.360 --> 1:01:10.800]  when he was up for his confirmation hearing about the fact that he claimed he
[1:01:10.800 --> 1:01:14.320]  had shut down these influence operations which actually allowed those to
[1:01:14.320 --> 1:01:19.880]  continue worse yet he put a prominent Chinese influence operator on the board
[1:01:19.880 --> 1:01:25.400]  of trustees of the Carnegie Endowment there's no evidence in the record that
[1:01:25.400 --> 1:01:29.120]  this administration is prepared to truly confront China according to the
[1:01:29.120 --> 1:01:33.520]  confidential briefing obtained by the Sydney Morning Herald Australian Defense
[1:01:33.520 --> 1:01:39.160]  Force advisor Major General Adam Finley said last year that China was already
[1:01:39.160 --> 1:01:44.560]  engaged in gray zone warfare Finley went on to explain that China has game
[1:01:44.560 --> 1:01:49.600]  plan strategies to circumvent traditional military red lines to avoid
[1:01:49.600 --> 1:01:55.520]  direct conflict and so is utilizing more subtle and unconventional forms of
[1:01:55.520 --> 1:02:00.000]  attack General Finley said they know that Western democracies have peace and
[1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:04.440]  then when they crossed the line we get really angry then we start bombing
[1:02:04.440 --> 1:02:09.440]  people China said according to Finley let's be smarter let's just play below
[1:02:09.440 --> 1:02:14.520]  the threshold before it goes to war let's achieve things strategically without
[1:02:14.520 --> 1:02:19.360]  having a war so now we have a new dimension China's use of political
[1:02:19.360 --> 1:02:24.280]  warfare is having a confounding effect on the West which is more accustomed to
[1:02:24.280 --> 1:02:29.320]  direct kinetic warfare recently it was reported that China is moving behind the
[1:02:29.320 --> 1:02:34.400]  scenes towards establishing a major naval port on the west coast of Africa
[1:02:34.400 --> 1:02:39.320]  that would host Chinese submarines and aircraft carriers capable of projecting
[1:02:39.320 --> 1:02:44.640]  Beijing's military power directly into the Atlantic according to a top military
[1:02:44.640 --> 1:02:50.360]  official as China extends its hand into a Western culture Alex Jones here with

[1:04:03.440 --> 1:04:11.040]  sun broadcasting live from the U.N. stronghold Austin Texas you're listening to
[1:04:11.040 --> 1:04:26.520]  the Alex Jones show all right ladies and gentlemen we are now into our number two
[1:04:26.520 --> 1:04:32.640]  on this Monday May 10th 2021 broadcast I am your host Alex Jones and man is it
[1:04:32.640 --> 1:04:39.800]  not huge news Fox News even the Wall Street Journal the Daily Mail the
[1:04:39.800 --> 1:04:45.280]  Australian newspaper broke Chinese military scientists discuss weaponizing
[1:04:45.280 --> 1:04:52.000]  SARS COVID viruses coronaviruses to shut down the U.S. economy in a new era of
[1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:59.200]  genetic weapons just a few years ago the same year that Fauci and Gates moved the
[1:04:59.200 --> 1:05:04.960]  Chapel Hill North Carolina base over there this really is an act of war but
[1:05:04.960 --> 1:05:08.800]  it's a globalist group working through communist China that did this so you
[1:05:08.800 --> 1:05:13.800]  can't just blame the communist Chinese you've got to blame Bill Gates you've
[1:05:13.800 --> 1:05:17.960]  got to blame Fauci because they're the ones still in charge of most of the
[1:05:17.960 --> 1:05:21.120]  major medical health departments in the world with the hundreds of billions of
[1:05:21.120 --> 1:05:28.240]  dollars in the major Carnegie endowment that with the IBM endowment with the
[1:05:28.240 --> 1:05:33.120]  Ford endowment gave their world government project money about 21 years
[1:05:33.120 --> 1:05:38.080]  ago to Bill Gates to be the manager now he's being removed as the manager right
[1:05:38.080 --> 1:05:44.440]  now because he's not a good pitchman and that's the process and who is the
[1:05:44.440 --> 1:05:51.920]  current CIA director he was the director of the Carnegie endowment for world
[1:05:51.920 --> 1:05:59.680]  peace what did Carnegie's endowment for world peace find by World War one they
[1:05:59.680 --> 1:06:02.840]  wanted a world government run by the League of Nations that didn't work so
[1:06:02.840 --> 1:06:06.000]  they had the UN later the Rockefellers put their money into the
[1:06:06.000 --> 1:06:10.280]  Carnegie endowment to fund it the world government project is the one that
[1:06:10.280 --> 1:06:15.480]  wants to end men as we know it they say that will end war really that will just
[1:06:15.480 --> 1:06:19.200]  end men that challenge their dominance they're the ones that want world
[1:06:19.200 --> 1:06:22.400]  government they're the ones that want communism they're the ones that don't
[1:06:22.400 --> 1:06:30.960]  want the United States to exist and that's who runs the CIA for Obama and
[1:06:30.960 --> 1:06:43.880]  his puppet president of course Joe Biden and so what's really happening this is
[1:06:43.880 --> 1:06:51.040]  being done right now in the media because the Communist Chinese and the
[1:06:51.040 --> 1:06:54.520]  Bill Gates faction wanted to go ahead and keep the US locked down forever and
[1:06:54.520 --> 1:06:58.120]  totally collapse us and the globalists don't want to do that they want to toy
[1:06:58.120 --> 1:07:02.240]  with us and turn us into a globalist enclave first and then bring communist
[1:07:02.240 --> 1:07:07.760]  China down along with the United States at a later point and so you're seeing
[1:07:07.760 --> 1:07:13.440]  inner jockeying and inner battling going on right now and that's why suddenly you
[1:07:13.440 --> 1:07:18.400]  see the White House come out and said we could never reopen and say the COVID-19
[1:07:18.400 --> 1:07:23.560]  response coordinator we're turning the corner Fauci you just said we can never
[1:07:23.560 --> 1:07:28.160]  reopen now says oh it may be time to relax indoor face mask mandates who
[1:07:28.160 --> 1:07:34.320]  make this guy God why does big tech censor everybody that questions the
[1:07:34.320 --> 1:07:37.240]  official narrative why doesn't censor medical doctors and scientists because
[1:07:37.240 --> 1:07:43.200]  it's a global government power move but now there's enough people in the
[1:07:43.200 --> 1:07:46.480]  globalist power structure that don't want to finish America off for whatever
[1:07:46.480 --> 1:07:51.680]  reasons that the fact that Fauci and Gates working with the chai comms
[1:07:51.680 --> 1:08:00.840]  developed gain of function and released it that is now being brought out to
[1:08:00.840 --> 1:08:06.320]  threaten the Chinese arm of the new world order to make sure they don't get to
[1:08:06.320 --> 1:08:10.880]  uppity and so the globalist want to dominate us they want to casual society
[1:08:10.880 --> 1:08:17.000]  they want to market the beast they want to put implantable microchips in us they
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:25.120]  want to do it all but they don't want China in total full control of it they
[1:08:25.120 --> 1:08:28.880]  want the Chinese authoritarian model to be the model worldwide but they don't
[1:08:28.880 --> 1:08:37.520]  want them to dominate it at least not yet so just a couple days ago he said
[1:08:37.520 --> 1:08:41.640]  we're gonna wear mask forever I played the clip yesterday oh master to be
[1:08:41.640 --> 1:08:45.320]  permanent the next day says okay maybe we could take him off and that's because
[1:08:45.320 --> 1:08:49.880]  all the China information is coming out about him and what he did he needs to go
[1:08:49.880 --> 1:08:56.520]  to prison so does Bill Gates so I told you about this and it's all ties together
[1:08:56.520 --> 1:09:02.640]  but here is a bunch of these news articles and we can also pull up the
[1:09:02.640 --> 1:09:07.840]  Wall Street Journal that has a similar headline and again the point that it's
[1:09:07.840 --> 1:09:12.320]  there lets you know that the battle inside the power structure is really
[1:09:12.320 --> 1:09:17.280]  reaching a crescendo I don't think it's reached its finale yet but it's
[1:09:17.280 --> 1:09:22.200]  definitely coming into the crescendo Melinda Gates was a meeting with
[1:09:22.200 --> 1:09:26.320]  divorce lawyers since 2019 to end marriage with Bill Gates the philanthropists
[1:09:26.320 --> 1:09:30.640]  had discussions with lawyers in October around the time when Microsoft co-founders
[1:09:30.640 --> 1:09:36.400]  ties with Jeffrey Epstein became public and what we now know Melinda Gates would
[1:09:36.400 --> 1:09:42.320]  go stay at his house and she was so creeped out and realized she was just a
[1:09:42.320 --> 1:09:50.920]  beard for Bill's perversion and why was Bill hanging out with Gates why was
[1:09:50.920 --> 1:09:56.840]  Epstein hanging around with Gates and vice versa because somebody wasn't just
[1:09:56.840 --> 1:10:01.000]  running underage girls somebody wasn't just in the Satanism somebody wasn't
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:05.240]  just in a human sacrifice somebody wasn't just a Mossad MI6 CIA triple
[1:10:05.240 --> 1:10:12.720]  agent somebody was running illegal cloning operations and Gates is very
[1:10:12.720 --> 1:10:19.280]  excited about that he doesn't just own a bunch of fine cloned horses he doesn't
[1:10:19.280 --> 1:10:26.120]  just own cloning farms around the world of dogs and cats and sheep and cows and
[1:10:26.120 --> 1:10:32.480]  horses but he likes those human clones that's the coolest thing to have and
[1:10:32.480 --> 1:10:37.680]  they take the women there and they artificially inseminate them with clones
[1:10:37.680 --> 1:10:44.840]  of world leaders I told just where it came out that Epstein was obsessed with
[1:10:44.840 --> 1:10:50.680]  genetic engineering and creating hundreds of babies that he had sired they
[1:10:50.680 --> 1:10:55.080]  weren't hundreds of babies he'd sired when people found out more and he was
[1:10:55.080 --> 1:10:58.920]  so excited what they were doing there he said oh I have all these birthing
[1:10:58.920 --> 1:11:03.480]  centers because I'm having a bunch of my children to save the human race with my
[1:11:03.480 --> 1:11:10.200]  genetics but that was a metaphor for saving the human race by cloning the
[1:11:10.200 --> 1:11:15.200]  Queen of England cloning the Duke of Edinburgh cloning Prince Charles
[1:11:15.200 --> 1:11:25.280]  cloning Lord Rothschild and that's not the only cloning facility they've got
[1:11:25.280 --> 1:11:29.240]  they've got cloning facilities in New Zealand they've got cloning facilities
[1:11:29.240 --> 1:11:34.280]  in Kauai Hawaii they've got cloning facilities in upstate New York they've
[1:11:34.280 --> 1:11:39.080]  got cloning facilities in northern Canada they have cloning facilities in
[1:11:39.080 --> 1:11:49.800]  Costa Rica and Lord knows what they're doing with the clones but these aren't
[1:11:49.800 --> 1:11:55.840]  clones they keep in suspended animation like the matrix these clones are out
[1:11:55.840 --> 1:12:06.480]  walking around and they don't even know who they are they're in school right
[1:12:06.480 --> 1:12:13.160]  next to your children some of them are already grown up they've got jobs why
[1:12:13.160 --> 1:12:17.160]  they get a knock on the door corporate America's got a special job for you we're
[1:12:17.160 --> 1:12:25.640]  gonna put you in a fast track towards this and that my friends is the rest of
[1:12:25.640 --> 1:12:29.880]  the story and that's how I was able to tell you day one this happened last week
[1:12:29.880 --> 1:12:37.400]  that it's about Epstein because Bill's being blackmailed Bill wasn't just
[1:12:37.400 --> 1:12:42.360]  blackmailing now he's being blackmailed by these groups inner fighting over
[1:12:42.360 --> 1:12:44.760]  power because they're gonna build the world government they're gonna build the
[1:12:44.760 --> 1:12:49.600]  control room for the planet they're gonna build this system but they're gonna
[1:12:49.600 --> 1:12:52.800]  fight over who gets control of it and it's gonna get more and more violent
[1:12:52.800 --> 1:12:56.680]  towards the end once they put in the world AI system once they've got the
[1:12:56.680 --> 1:13:01.520]  combat robots in place what happens when somebody hacks the robots like they
[1:13:01.520 --> 1:13:08.960]  just did the East Coast pipeline well don't worry Klaus Schwab tells us there's
[1:13:08.960 --> 1:13:15.200]  gonna be a big cybercrash from terrorists soon and of course that'll be
[1:13:15.200 --> 1:13:21.160]  the globalists and that's where all of this is going the Marines have announced
[1:13:21.160 --> 1:13:26.960]  by 2030 almost their whole force will be robot no longer human the Air Force is
[1:13:26.960 --> 1:13:30.720]  announcing they're gonna phase out MPs and have robots because they won't make
[1:13:30.720 --> 1:13:35.760]  mistakes they won't be racist oh but who programs them they'll follow their
[1:13:35.760 --> 1:13:39.640]  orders I told you yet so many years ago I said you'll just wake up one day
[1:13:39.640 --> 1:13:42.840]  there'll be armies of robots everywhere they have giant factories building
[1:13:42.840 --> 1:13:46.960]  millions of them right now before they flip the switch and outcome rushing out
[1:13:46.960 --> 1:13:57.920]  of those hangers it is a big idea a new world order in the near future earth is
[1:13:57.920 --> 1:14:04.960]  dominated by a powerful is known as the builder for their objective the world
[1:14:04.960 --> 1:14:10.800]  domination for thousands of years their dark order group now as they hail the

[1:15:22.720 --> 1:15:27.280]  things are I want to keep working under the future but again that's really up
[1:15:27.280 --> 1:15:32.600]  to you and up to God so please I hope God works through you and puts a message

[1:15:39.680 --> 1:15:43.840]  what you've done and just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision
[1:15:43.840 --> 1:15:47.240]  is for you and hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support him
[1:15:47.240 --> 1:15:50.280]  for worse God bless
[1:15:50.280 --> 1:16:14.280]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:16:21.120 --> 1:16:27.000]  so there is a war for global domination that really means a war to
[1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:30.440]  control the art to control the literature to control the science to
[1:16:30.440 --> 1:16:36.460]  control the future to play God and that's why you've got so many really bad
[1:16:36.460 --> 1:16:41.640]  evil people that crave power lusting after power and control and then setting
[1:16:41.640 --> 1:16:45.440]  themselves up as guardians of the earth who need to quote get rid of the human
[1:16:45.440 --> 1:16:51.040]  population for our own best interest but of course that's really just a blank
[1:16:51.040 --> 1:16:55.640]  check for them to act however they want again I'm Alex Jones your host I want
[1:16:55.640 --> 1:17:00.480]  to open the phones up for the next hour and 45 minutes till we have a special
[1:17:00.480 --> 1:17:03.960]  guest that's going to be joining us in studio to talk about the economy and so
[1:17:03.960 --> 1:17:08.080]  much more and I would like to hear from
[1:17:09.120 --> 1:17:14.560]  anybody that wants to comment including military including people that live in
[1:17:14.560 --> 1:17:22.480]  the foreign service including company owners anybody that wants to comment on
[1:17:22.480 --> 1:17:32.400]  communist China and this ministry of war war college report with the
[1:17:32.400 --> 1:17:37.760]  communist Chinese in 2015 when the SARS gain of function weapon system was
[1:17:37.760 --> 1:17:43.480]  moved by Obama to the Wuhan lab be controlled by Fauci saying we'll use
[1:17:43.480 --> 1:17:47.680]  this to shut down the US and collapse their economy collapse their hospitals
[1:17:47.680 --> 1:17:52.840]  and that is indeed what they did but it didn't collapse the hospitals it was
[1:17:52.840 --> 1:17:56.200]  designed to collapse the rest of the nation saying collapse the country so
[1:17:56.200 --> 1:18:00.360]  the hospitals stay open which of course was asinine it wasn't the case it was
[1:18:00.360 --> 1:18:04.600]  economic warfare and you saw all the biggest billionaires double and triple
[1:18:04.600 --> 1:18:08.480]  their wealth all the big globalist all the big tech companies they became
[1:18:08.480 --> 1:18:15.400]  fabulously rich as you and I became obsolete and you see that case-shaped
[1:18:15.400 --> 1:18:21.560]  recovery where the ultra rich got bigger yachts the size of football fields and
[1:18:21.560 --> 1:18:27.560]  at bigger palaces so they could go out to sea and go out of their 50,000 acre
[1:18:27.560 --> 1:18:31.520]  ranches and stay away from us when we were locked up inside our apartment
[1:18:31.520 --> 1:18:38.320]  buildings watching our families commit suicide or die from fentanyl and so this
[1:18:38.320 --> 1:18:42.040]  has been quite an assault and the globalists used our open free society
[1:18:42.040 --> 1:18:45.560]  as a pretext to do it they bought off our media who went along with the
[1:18:45.560 --> 1:18:51.240]  communist Chinese Yuan propaganda to wear the mask and to believe the fake
[1:18:51.240 --> 1:18:54.520]  numbers and to silence the doctors and scientists that told the truth and our
[1:18:54.520 --> 1:19:04.560]  journey into tyranny has been very very fast and very very deep but the
[1:19:04.560 --> 1:19:12.400]  communist chai comms that's a double statement the chai comms and their
[1:19:12.400 --> 1:19:15.720]  globalist interests are even more greedy and don't even want a trading partner
[1:19:15.720 --> 1:19:25.480]  they wanted us total war on the street complete and absolute collapse and so
[1:19:25.480 --> 1:19:29.720]  they were going to continue to keep us completely shut down until there was no
[1:19:29.720 --> 1:19:34.360]  economy at all and so suddenly the news of Fauci being a Chinese agent suddenly
[1:19:34.360 --> 1:19:37.240]  the Bill Gates and this comes out suddenly Bill Gates is going to be
[1:19:37.240 --> 1:19:42.640]  getting divorced from his wife and watch is not going to be a spokesperson so
[1:19:42.640 --> 1:19:47.080]  much for depopulation now because he is the most hated unpopular person on
[1:19:47.080 --> 1:19:52.440]  earth now and I made that statement last week the day of I said he's the most
[1:19:52.440 --> 1:19:56.840]  unpopular person in the world his wife went to the Epstein's facility was
[1:19:56.840 --> 1:20:01.000]  around it knows about the pedophilia and as a bare minimum she knows that her
[1:20:01.000 --> 1:20:05.440]  husband ex-husband now is being blackmailed and so she is moving away
[1:20:05.440 --> 1:20:12.520]  from him because he is a perishable item now his stock has gone down to negative
[1:20:12.520 --> 1:20:19.240]  levels his personal stock in the world's view he thought buying off the media and
[1:20:19.240 --> 1:20:23.160]  having the media say he was a hero would make people loving instead it made
[1:20:23.160 --> 1:20:29.160]  people hate him even more because they hate the corrupt lying media super
[1:20:29.160 --> 1:20:32.160]  villain Bill Gates is
[1:20:35.520 --> 1:20:42.680]  he is a bane against humanity so what do you make of all this coming out that
[1:20:42.680 --> 1:20:50.400]  indeed it was a Wuhan Chinese Communist military that indeed the Gates is being
[1:20:50.400 --> 1:20:54.560]  blackmailed indeed there were all sorts of weird illegal studies and cloning
[1:20:54.560 --> 1:21:00.240]  experiments and some of that's even starting to come out and that it's a
[1:21:00.240 --> 1:21:05.840]  cult of crazy rich people who all want to be richer than the other guy they all
[1:21:05.840 --> 1:21:10.080]  agree on the globalist system because it's evil and gives them power but
[1:21:10.080 --> 1:21:13.600]  there's that dark force that's set it up and generations come and go but that
[1:21:13.600 --> 1:21:17.680]  dark force is leading humanity towards total destruction and now we're so close
[1:21:17.680 --> 1:21:24.640]  and now Clow Schwab the stories up on info wars dot com has come out on
[1:21:24.640 --> 1:21:30.560]  international television and say we need a world health pass based on first a
[1:21:30.560 --> 1:21:34.160]  wristband you wear or in your clothing and then a microchip under your skin
[1:21:34.160 --> 1:21:38.680]  and he says it'll be here within five years because he said this on January
[1:21:38.680 --> 1:21:46.600]  10th 2016 it just got discovered last Friday I hadn't seen it no one else I
[1:21:46.600 --> 1:21:52.320]  know it's seen it maybe you'd seen it but now what's old's new here he is
[1:21:52.320 --> 1:21:56.080]  admitting it all remember Bill Gates is surrogate groups his own fact-checking
[1:21:56.080 --> 1:22:00.480]  group he owns news guard will come out and say Alex Jones is lying there is no
[1:22:00.480 --> 1:22:06.000]  plan to put a microchip in you to track as your global health pass when he's
[1:22:06.000 --> 1:22:09.280]  been funding in an MIT and pushing it and we have the witnesses in the
[1:22:09.280 --> 1:22:15.040]  documents and the patents but here's Clow Schwab saying it five years ago
[1:22:15.040 --> 1:22:28.720]  we're going to be in the plan of our clothes and then we can imagine it will
[1:22:28.720 --> 1:22:36.880]  be in our brains implanted in our skin and again maybe there will be a
[1:22:36.880 --> 1:22:44.760]  direct communication with our brain and digital world what we see is a kind of
[1:22:44.760 --> 1:22:51.720]  fusion physical digital biological world we call someone we don't even have
[1:22:51.720 --> 1:22:56.440]  relax it's like to take a device that naturally a technique continues the
[1:22:56.440 --> 1:23:02.440]  body yes you talk and you say I want to be connected with anyone now connected
[1:23:02.440 --> 1:23:08.480]  with anyone and you have a personalized bot and I saw the mr. dr. bird
[1:23:08.480 --> 1:23:12.120]  predicted it by the end of the year we will have this robot
[1:23:12.120 --> 1:23:19.200]  and he goes on to say you'll have a butler in your house is a I
[1:23:19.200 --> 1:23:23.240]  tax everything you do yeah I'll tell you when they order it too as well
[1:23:23.240 --> 1:23:30.840]  we may be a difference it's a serviteur no we'll be a slave it'll be an AI intelligence artificial he'll be
[1:23:30.840 --> 1:23:37.240]  intellectual and he's not only a water assistant for day and I'm paraphrasing this
[1:23:37.240 --> 1:23:41.640]  anybody can do a reasonable transfer of you really want to be a partner an
[1:23:41.640 --> 1:23:47.320]  intellectual partner with you and that's what the transhumanism is about is
[1:23:47.320 --> 1:23:51.200]  people will then be told oh it knows your voice it knows your voice print knows
[1:23:51.200 --> 1:23:55.280]  everything about you it can fool your family that it's you so when you die
[1:23:55.280 --> 1:24:02.800]  they'll say you're being transmitted uploaded into this machine and later it
[1:24:02.800 --> 1:24:07.400]  will be transmitted into flesh as well and they'll say it's you but it's not
[1:24:07.400 --> 1:24:12.280]  really going to be you but it'll have rights after all the 300 pound man can
[1:24:12.280 --> 1:24:15.120]  go compete against women and weightlifting and win and then we'll
[1:24:15.120 --> 1:24:19.120]  say he's a woman but we're gonna say a robot's a human too and that's the big
[1:24:19.120 --> 1:24:23.200]  scam the big lie of the transhumanist and really all the machines will be
[1:24:23.200 --> 1:24:27.200]  programmed by the AI system and by the globalist who the magicians running this
[1:24:27.200 --> 1:24:31.200]  fraud and people are gonna be lined up to get uploaded into a machine and
[1:24:31.200 --> 1:24:36.080]  pretend that they have already reached immortality it is an absolutely

[1:27:44.120 --> 1:27:49.120]  infowar.com
[1:27:49.120 --> 1:27:56.240]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:28:19.120 --> 1:28:36.200]  All right I'm specifically taking phone calls on the Communist Chinese and the
[1:28:36.200 --> 1:28:40.480]  fact that their own Army War College talked about using a COVID coronavirus
[1:28:40.480 --> 1:28:45.480]  weapon to shut down our economy and to use fear to bankrupt us and you see the
[1:28:45.480 --> 1:28:51.280]  UN you see Fauci you see Bill Gates you see Big Tech all working in lockstep with
[1:28:51.280 --> 1:28:56.280]  the UN to shut down Europe to shut down the US to shut down everywhere but China
[1:28:56.280 --> 1:29:00.440]  who now has gone from the number two economy to the number one economy the
[1:29:00.440 --> 1:29:08.920]  last year deliberately set up what is your take on that 877-789-2539 and and
[1:29:08.920 --> 1:29:13.600]  why do you think these documents are coming up why do you think the mainstream
[1:29:13.600 --> 1:29:19.520]  media is pointing out that Fauci ran the Wuhan lab coronavirus research I mean I
[1:29:19.520 --> 1:29:23.760]  pretty much know the reason why because they had a deal with the globalist to
[1:29:23.760 --> 1:29:27.840]  get rid of Trump and then take the restrictions off but the chai comms said
[1:29:27.840 --> 1:29:31.200]  no we're gonna keep him in place because it's making us so powerful and
[1:29:31.200 --> 1:29:34.680]  another arm of the globalist said no you've gone too far and that's why you
[1:29:34.680 --> 1:29:38.560]  see this happening so I wouldn't rejoice over this because they'll bring these
[1:29:38.560 --> 1:29:44.640]  restrictions back over and over again if we don't expose Fauci and gay to the
[1:29:44.640 --> 1:29:48.120]  new world order it's not enough for them to just recede for a while they're
[1:29:48.120 --> 1:29:51.440]  gonna launch this globalist lockdown again to consolidate power and teach us
[1:29:51.440 --> 1:29:55.040]  that we're not essential they've got to be brought to justice but how much
[1:29:55.040 --> 1:30:00.000]  credibility does it give you that you were aware of the Wuhan lab that you knew
[1:30:00.000 --> 1:30:02.920]  that it came from there that you knew Fauci was involved that you told your
[1:30:02.920 --> 1:30:12.760]  friends and family it's a big deal 877-789-2539 and then I've got all these
[1:30:12.760 --> 1:30:16.280]  other big reports up on info wars.com if I take some calls I'm gonna get into
[1:30:16.280 --> 1:30:21.840]  COVID vaccine deaths the numbers point to a catastrophe very important report
[1:30:21.840 --> 1:30:26.480]  we'll be getting to GOP governors slash unemployment benefits as businesses
[1:30:26.480 --> 1:30:35.880]  plead for workers but it's already caused the global snarl or collapse in the
[1:30:35.880 --> 1:30:41.840]  supply chain continuing scientists discovered living fossil
[1:30:41.840 --> 1:30:46.360]  thought extinct for 273 million years that's also up on info wars.com we'll
[1:30:46.360 --> 1:30:51.400]  tell you about that coming up so that they thought seal of cancer had been
[1:30:51.400 --> 1:30:55.320]  dead for 25 million years and they're in the ocean. Biden official cyber attacks
[1:30:55.320 --> 1:31:01.560]  against US infrastructure here to stay oh just get used to it learn to put up
[1:31:01.560 --> 1:31:05.280]  with it Israel calls on by administration to stay out of Jerusalem
[1:31:05.280 --> 1:31:13.560]  crisis well if you think you've got a problem in Jerusalem wait until the
[1:31:13.560 --> 1:31:18.400]  summer and the end of summer when global food prices are up 76% they've
[1:31:18.400 --> 1:31:24.040]  already gone up just as I started telling you about that global index report
[1:31:24.040 --> 1:31:28.520]  two weeks ago global food prices have already gone about eight percent just in
[1:31:28.520 --> 1:31:32.800]  two weeks so if you add that up but by the end of summer it'll be bigger than
[1:31:32.800 --> 1:31:39.840]  76% but you're going to see major civil unrest around the world where in other
[1:31:39.840 --> 1:31:43.280]  countries they spend the majority of their money on food and so if you're
[1:31:43.280 --> 1:31:47.200]  already spending half your money on food and food prices double you starved
[1:31:47.200 --> 1:31:53.680]  death wow and again the globalists have engineered this so nicely they've done
[1:31:53.680 --> 1:32:01.760]  such a good job at this what a nightmare scenario how do we stop it well one arm
[1:32:01.760 --> 1:32:04.960]  of the globalists just wanted to get a world ID and a world qr code and world
[1:32:04.960 --> 1:32:09.280]  social credit score and get control and kind of have martial law in place but
[1:32:09.280 --> 1:32:13.080]  did they want total collapse of the third world do they want total collapse of
[1:32:13.080 --> 1:32:18.120]  our industry no no no no no another faction doesn't want to go that far so
[1:32:18.120 --> 1:32:24.960]  now which faction is going to win this is the real world instead of debating all
[1:32:24.960 --> 1:32:28.240]  day whether or not it was a bio weapon or whether or not it came out of Wuhan
[1:32:28.240 --> 1:32:32.880]  or whether or not Fauci should get in trouble we know all that the question is
[1:32:32.880 --> 1:32:40.840]  what's the motive and what do we do about it and what do you think of the fall of
[1:32:40.840 --> 1:32:47.520]  Bill Gates that's what zero heads ask they ask is the world really turning on
[1:32:47.520 --> 1:32:53.320]  Bill Gates and yes the answer is Bill Gates has been blackmail Bill Gates is
[1:32:53.320 --> 1:32:56.080]  in trouble Bill Gates was involved with Jeffrey Epstein in another blackmail
[1:32:56.080 --> 1:33:02.040]  operation and so yes the system is turning on him and his wife who's another
[1:33:02.040 --> 1:33:11.280]  eugenicist and bad news as well is moving away from him for self-preservation
[1:33:11.280 --> 1:33:16.520]  but it does show that being the spokesperson for the new world order is
[1:33:16.520 --> 1:33:20.800]  not a good thing they thought they'd have 80% of the US vaccinated by now or
[1:33:20.800 --> 1:33:27.320]  more they've got like 30% they lie and say 40 it's not no probably get 50% or
[1:33:27.320 --> 1:33:35.560]  so but they wanted to have 90% done by the middle of this year or more so they
[1:33:35.560 --> 1:33:40.560]  could start bullying the 10% that hadn't done it and say it's our fault that's
[1:33:40.560 --> 1:33:43.560]  why there's mutations even though the vaccine causes mutations and
[1:33:43.560 --> 1:33:46.800]  discrains and and you know oh there's not herd immunity because you didn't take
[1:33:46.800 --> 1:33:52.800]  it but when they've got 40 55 60% depending on the area not taking it
[1:33:52.800 --> 1:33:56.440]  and people are watching their neighbors and friends that did take it get sick
[1:33:56.440 --> 1:34:04.320]  from COVID well that that's a problem for them because they figured they get
[1:34:04.320 --> 1:34:07.760]  90% vaccinated that would make the whole economy collapse down the road from
[1:34:07.760 --> 1:34:13.720]  laying down the medical system see it's not the virus that does that it's the
[1:34:13.720 --> 1:34:16.760]  vaccine that does it and that's what the Chinese battle plan talks about is
[1:34:16.760 --> 1:34:24.800]  once they've launched their attack shutting down our medical system so now
[1:34:24.800 --> 1:34:28.640]  they say they want to shun us they want to shame us they want to make us feel
[1:34:28.640 --> 1:34:31.080]  bad
[1:34:31.080 --> 1:34:36.120]  Fauci says military who refused COVID-19 vaccine are part of the problem after
[1:34:36.120 --> 1:34:41.080]  high rate of service members refuse the injection yeah it's over 80% in some
[1:34:41.080 --> 1:34:45.960]  Marine Corps bases yes you'll read news like 49% get vaccinated they'll say of
[1:34:45.960 --> 1:34:49.600]  a test group that we're asked to take it but it's as high as 80 plus percent on
[1:34:49.600 --> 1:34:57.720]  some basis and now the sadness because people aren't afraid anymore he's like
[1:34:57.720 --> 1:35:03.520]  okay you don't need the vaccine and I expect Trump now that the heat's off of
[1:35:03.520 --> 1:35:07.920]  him and the economy's reopening they did hold his hostage with the shots oh you
[1:35:07.920 --> 1:35:10.720]  can reopen once you take the shots well now we see they don't reopen once we take
[1:35:10.720 --> 1:35:14.600]  them and the mass stay on the logic's not there Trump should come out and say
[1:35:14.600 --> 1:35:17.760]  hey I thought this was a regular vaccine but we've got some evidence it's a
[1:35:17.760 --> 1:35:22.600]  problem Pfizer's been banned in China it's been banned in India
[1:35:22.600 --> 1:35:26.640]  AstraZeneca's been banned in 21 countries in Europe all the vaccines have been
[1:35:26.640 --> 1:35:29.320]  banned in different countries because they've had really bad side effects and
[1:35:29.320 --> 1:35:34.120]  really bad problems because it's not a side effect it's the direct effect all
[1:35:34.120 --> 1:35:37.520]  right I'm gonna stop ranting and we're gonna go to Jim and Carlos and Scott and

[1:39:57.720 --> 1:40:02.120]  answer is the supply chain has broken down I have to either reformulate or I
[1:40:02.120 --> 1:40:05.600]  have to lower the quality to get a lot of these and so that's why we don't have a

[1:42:54.640 --> 1:43:04.080]  on for 1400 1600 700 years and you do have the Muslims going to go to the
[1:43:04.080 --> 1:43:09.080]  Temple Mount where they're been going for thousands of years and they're not
[1:43:09.080 --> 1:43:13.640]  being allowed to do it and they're being attacked because of COVID why you can't
[1:43:13.640 --> 1:43:17.280]  go to your church your mosque so just like they're shutting churches down in
[1:43:17.280 --> 1:43:24.640]  the UK and here in the US and Australia the Muslims are again starting to get
[1:43:24.640 --> 1:43:30.360]  mad about that and I gotta say I'm not anti-Israel but at the same time I am
[1:43:30.360 --> 1:43:35.480]  anti not letting you know people go where they're going and you can say well
[1:43:35.480 --> 1:43:41.120]  there they are cheering as they burn the Temple Mount well that's that's something
[1:43:41.120 --> 1:43:45.520]  they think's been taken away from them and so that's a form of a protest I
[1:43:45.520 --> 1:43:49.000]  don't want to see violence on either side but Netanyahu going along with the
[1:43:49.000 --> 1:43:52.920]  COVID lockdowns putting out freedom bracelets I talk about chips and all
[1:43:52.920 --> 1:43:58.320]  the children like Klaus Schwab's doing ever since he got indicted Netanyahu
[1:43:58.320 --> 1:44:02.560]  has been doing whatever the Rothschilds the globalists say and so you've got
[1:44:02.560 --> 1:44:10.360]  Jews there celebrating the Temple Mount is on fire as well so this is just a
[1:44:10.360 --> 1:44:16.120]  people going crazy every day been locked up on both sides why you're seeing so
[1:44:16.120 --> 1:44:19.440]  many shootings so many domestic violence I mean this has been a giant
[1:44:19.440 --> 1:44:26.800]  pressure cooker this has been a giant pressure cooker the whole time and when
[1:44:26.800 --> 1:44:32.200]  you lock people up and you do this you're going to get explosions and this
[1:44:32.200 --> 1:44:36.320]  summer with global food prices going up 76% by end of summer according to
[1:44:36.320 --> 1:44:40.920]  global Bloomberg index you can expect this to go on and when it happens they're
[1:44:40.920 --> 1:44:44.080]  gonna say oh it's because America's racist or oh this is real sister that
[1:44:44.080 --> 1:44:49.360]  but the underlying issue is the economy is falling apart and that is a fact
[1:44:49.360 --> 1:44:54.240]  that contributes to this and so the globalists have got all these movies
[1:44:54.240 --> 1:44:59.120]  about race war and all these movies about how bad white people are but it's
[1:44:59.120 --> 1:45:03.160]  all a political cover for the fact that we're an economic war with the globalist
[1:45:03.160 --> 1:45:10.120]  that are accelerating their takeover Biden official says cyber attacks against
[1:45:10.120 --> 1:45:17.200]  US infrastructure are here to stay oh really why is that well it turns out
[1:45:17.200 --> 1:45:21.880]  plow swab and the Davos group along with John Hopkins have been rubbing their
[1:45:21.880 --> 1:45:25.480]  hands together saying oh if you think COVID was away for world government to
[1:45:25.480 --> 1:45:29.600]  take over they're gonna have a cyber attack close quote on the banking system
[1:45:29.600 --> 1:45:34.640]  that allows it to bring out a world ID and a world central currency controlled
[1:45:34.640 --> 1:45:38.800]  by the United Nations so that's their answer to this they're all so happy
[1:45:38.800 --> 1:45:44.200]  about the gas pipeline from Houston to the entire East Coast through the South
[1:45:44.200 --> 1:45:50.320]  to New York City shut down and an emergency a national emergency has been
[1:45:50.320 --> 1:45:55.640]  declared because they can't get the pipeline turned back on what did Biden
[1:45:55.640 --> 1:46:00.000]  do he shut off the keystone pipeline that brings oil out of Canada and the
[1:46:00.000 --> 1:46:06.840]  Midwest to Houston to refine to send it to the East Coast but now that's been
[1:46:06.840 --> 1:46:10.280]  shut down and now the other pipelines were shut down and environmentalist
[1:46:10.280 --> 1:46:13.160]  groups have been trying to block the permits to repair other pipelines
[1:46:13.160 --> 1:46:18.080]  they're tearing out hydroelectric dams that's the name of the game shut down
[1:46:18.080 --> 1:46:22.560]  the civilization shut down the society and make all investment move to
[1:46:22.560 --> 1:46:27.800]  communist China and then we are in checkmate ladies and gentlemen the
[1:46:27.800 --> 1:46:30.880]  globalists are just concerned that shutting us down for COVID to become a
[1:46:30.880 --> 1:46:35.760]  little too obvious so they've got other ways to do it and I would imagine that
[1:46:35.760 --> 1:46:39.960]  it is probably either the chai comms or a globalist group probably our own CIA
[1:46:39.960 --> 1:46:46.200]  because we have a Sinophile Carnegie Endowment CIA director that have done
[1:46:46.200 --> 1:46:50.320]  this to practice not having power having rolling blackouts not having enough
[1:46:50.320 --> 1:46:53.600]  fuel if they can't lock you down for COVID they're gonna lock you down by
[1:46:53.600 --> 1:46:58.560]  you're not having enough fuel to find gas to put in your car the whole plan is
[1:46:58.560 --> 1:47:02.160]  cut off US energy what did I say when Biden stole the election on January 20th
[1:47:02.160 --> 1:47:06.480]  I put out reports and I said soon you won't have gas at the gas pump you'll
[1:47:06.480 --> 1:47:10.120]  have rolling blackouts and now they're announcing nationwide rolling blackouts
[1:47:10.120 --> 1:47:14.360]  this summer we just can't produce the power anymore because they shut off most
[1:47:14.360 --> 1:47:19.200]  our coal power plants this is economic war ladies and gentlemen training you to
[1:47:19.200 --> 1:47:23.600]  live like a third-world slave all right Carlos is always interesting caller from
[1:47:23.600 --> 1:47:28.880]  Canada for calling for 15 years Carlos what's your take on China Bill Gates and
[1:47:28.880 --> 1:47:35.320]  all this news coming up well my take is that as you know I do a headline
[1:47:35.320 --> 1:47:40.600]  analysis for semantic analysis it's all electronic but you must remember in the
[1:47:40.600 --> 1:47:48.800]  2007 2008 period when China set eyes on Google and Google wanted to break into
[1:47:48.800 --> 1:47:54.440]  its market and it blinked when China said you can't come in here and do
[1:47:54.440 --> 1:47:59.720]  anything unless we control what you do it was just then it's a matter of time
[1:47:59.720 --> 1:48:05.880]  before that methodology was extended you know for economic reasons as well in
[1:48:05.880 --> 1:48:12.640]  profit to all places where Google is present I want to remind you of that at
[1:48:12.640 --> 1:48:18.400]  the same time you also have that the greatest purveyor of the high technology
[1:48:18.400 --> 1:48:22.480]  to China is actually one of our allies and we've discussed this in the past
[1:48:22.480 --> 1:48:28.000]  Israel as well as yeah as well as the fact that individuals such as Jeffrey
[1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:33.640]  Epstein were co-opting scientists getting them to have through money and you
[1:48:33.640 --> 1:48:37.360]  know blackmailers don't give money to people you know what I mean they take
[1:48:37.360 --> 1:48:41.720]  money from people so when you have somebody say that he was a blackmailer
[1:48:41.720 --> 1:48:46.760]  he was a blackmailer of what he was in blackmailer of power of influence he was
[1:48:46.760 --> 1:48:50.960]  getting people blackmailed and set up knowingly getting them to have sex with
[1:48:50.960 --> 1:48:54.640]  a child so they could be trusted so that he could then dial them into this
[1:48:54.640 --> 1:48:59.080]  crime network where they'd be above the law and be able to sell secrets through
[1:48:59.080 --> 1:49:05.800]  his pipeline to the Communist Chinese bingo and Robert Maxwell initiated the
[1:49:05.800 --> 1:49:10.680]  project he had it on his yacht but you know when the yacht went and Maxwell
[1:49:10.680 --> 1:49:15.480]  went with his yacht then they went to St. James little St. James Island then he
[1:49:15.480 --> 1:49:19.000]  was gonna go to an even larger St. James Island as you know in the in the
[1:49:19.000 --> 1:49:23.400]  history of this so you know at that point that Maxwell's daughter needed to
[1:49:23.400 --> 1:49:28.280]  have a submarine license you know to get around you know unseen and bring
[1:49:28.280 --> 1:49:32.400]  things to the island that perhaps little submarines brought but I want to
[1:49:32.400 --> 1:49:37.800]  just remind you that this is a breakdown of globalism because you see
[1:49:37.800 --> 1:49:42.320]  globalism doesn't work oh I totally agree it's a piratical backstabbing group
[1:49:42.320 --> 1:49:45.680]  they always are stabbing each other in the back you're right we're watching
[1:49:45.680 --> 1:49:49.640]  this we're watching them launch their world war three against us but in the
[1:49:49.640 --> 1:49:52.360]  end it's gonna bite him in the ass let me ask you this why do you think then
[1:49:52.360 --> 1:49:59.600]  it's coming out that Epstein and and and Soros and Gates were involved with the
[1:49:59.600 --> 1:50:03.280]  Communist Chinese what factions do you think are bringing that out and why is
[1:50:03.280 --> 1:50:08.320]  it always Australia now that's the tip of the spear well it's deflection okay
[1:50:08.320 --> 1:50:12.840]  the reality is that it's not just in West Africa where China is starting
[1:50:12.840 --> 1:50:20.520]  setting up a huge naval port facility military but it's also in Haifa Israel
[1:50:20.520 --> 1:50:25.480]  for the Mediterranean control and so on and the Chinese are setting up in major
[1:50:25.480 --> 1:50:32.440]  Caribbean islands as well precisely and what it is essentially is the fact that
[1:50:32.440 --> 1:50:37.880]  now Moderna Pfizer in particular as well as AstraZeneca has already decided
[1:50:37.880 --> 1:50:41.240]  that they're going to protect themselves by now saying that they're going to
[1:50:41.240 --> 1:50:45.320]  follow procedures as they would normally for any vaccine because they're afraid
[1:50:45.320 --> 1:50:50.120]  lawsuits are coming on stream class action suits are climbing on coming on
[1:50:50.120 --> 1:50:54.440]  steam on on on stream and I just want to make a point if I may a final point
[1:50:54.440 --> 1:50:58.760]  about American governments if tomorrow morning you walk up in the morning Alex
[1:50:58.760 --> 1:51:04.160]  and you saw little little parachutes becoming Chinese or whatever alien
[1:51:04.160 --> 1:51:08.520]  parachutes coming down to kill you you would turn to your military you would
[1:51:08.520 --> 1:51:13.080]  turn to your government for help okay but if all of a sudden you had these
[1:51:13.080 --> 1:51:16.960]  parachutes when they get closer becomes smaller and smaller to the level of
[1:51:16.960 --> 1:51:22.280]  being viruses who do you turn to oh no you turn to Fauci you turn to you know
[1:51:22.280 --> 1:51:26.280]  Bill Gates who are the exact people behind the attack I mean they wouldn't
[1:51:26.280 --> 1:51:29.200]  have the nerve to launch the attack unless they were in charge the response
[1:51:29.200 --> 1:51:33.760]  the attack that's what makes the attack so powerful that's correct and I turn to
[1:51:33.760 --> 1:51:41.120]  your governance to your to your to your governors to your senators they have to
[1:51:41.120 --> 1:51:45.760]  all make the giant leap forward with the evidence counter this openly or we're
[1:51:45.760 --> 1:51:49.920]  done that's how he's got to go Gates has got to be punished the whole thing's
[1:51:49.920 --> 1:51:53.120]  got to come out or it's over because they're going to keep using this for
[1:51:53.120 --> 1:51:57.000]  control of the future we can't have half measures where it's halfway leaked and
[1:51:57.000 --> 1:52:00.160]  then and then nothing's done you can't just know about Hunter's laptop he's a
[1:52:00.160 --> 1:52:04.680]  Chinese agent he's got to go to prison and so they're not gonna stop and so I
[1:52:04.680 --> 1:52:07.840]  ask everybody in the government everybody else are you really gonna let
[1:52:07.840 --> 1:52:11.240]  this happen and so that's where we are now thanks for the call great first
[1:52:11.240 --> 1:52:14.880]  caller now we're gonna accelerate the next hour get to all the calls Steve
[1:52:14.880 --> 1:52:21.240]  Tex Dave Casey David Ken Scott Jim everybody your calls are coming up but
[1:52:21.240 --> 1:52:26.440]  listen we have just in time delivery we have a very complex supply chain I told
[1:52:26.440 --> 1:52:30.120]  you a year of shutdown worldwide is going to create hyperinflation because
[1:52:30.120 --> 1:52:33.160]  there's more money chasing less products and that's the big news we're gonna
[1:52:33.160 --> 1:52:39.000]  cover next hour because a lot of stuff's coming out again I don't like to
[1:52:39.000 --> 1:52:42.360]  lecture people I'm a very private person but because of the globalist their
[1:52:42.360 --> 1:52:46.240]  attack on humanity I've been forced the last 27 years to be a public figure and
[1:52:46.240 --> 1:52:51.040]  we've given the globalist one hell of a run for their money because of God and I
[1:52:51.040 --> 1:52:54.440]  know some of our listeners get mad when I talk about God all day but just give me
[1:52:54.440 --> 1:52:58.320]  a break the Satanism's out of the open I've always been a Christian but now the
[1:52:58.320 --> 1:53:02.000]  fact that it's a fight between good and evil is so clear and I get it a lot of
[1:53:02.000 --> 1:53:05.160]  you've been turned off by big churches a lot of you've been turned off by the
[1:53:05.160 --> 1:53:10.040]  corrupt priest class system and I get it me too believe me I'm one of them but
[1:53:10.040 --> 1:53:16.200]  it's that relationship with God and just God's universe that God created that is
[1:53:16.200 --> 1:53:20.200]  so essential and then God created the universe for us to have communion with
[1:53:20.200 --> 1:53:23.440]  God through and to have life and so that's what info wars is really all

[1:55:12.160 --> 1:55:17.040]  in America and in the West in the last few hundred years even compared to the
[1:55:17.040 --> 1:55:21.360]  past it's been somewhat peaceful even though hundreds of millions were killed
[1:55:21.360 --> 1:55:27.200]  in the 20th century and war but things are lining up just for true disaster and

[1:56:45.440 --> 1:56:50.880]  because I started the ground roots here in my area with conservatives going
[1:56:50.880 --> 1:56:57.560]  after these people well I know that especially Massachusetts the stuff I see
[1:56:57.560 --> 1:57:03.720]  going on there in fact at one college in Massachusetts in my stack of news they
[1:57:03.720 --> 1:57:10.920]  they saw young ladies at a party off campus not wearing masks and smiling for
[1:57:10.920 --> 1:57:14.840]  a photo so they've been kicked out of the school for a semester they got to pay
[1:57:14.840 --> 1:57:20.560]  $16,000 I would leave that place what are the professors doing spying on them
[1:57:20.560 --> 1:57:23.680]  you know they were smuggling illegal aliens across the border they give them
[1:57:23.680 --> 1:57:28.560]  an award these colleges are run by control freak predators on average and
[1:57:28.560 --> 1:57:33.840]  people should desert the leftist schools but yeah Massachusetts man what a mess
[1:57:33.840 --> 1:57:38.320]  brother now it's real I'll hear everything you talk about Jones it's real
[1:57:38.320 --> 1:57:43.360]  like they do listen that they were busting of years ago people off the
[1:57:43.360 --> 1:57:47.560]  Cape homeless people because they don't want their the rich Cape over here to
[1:57:47.560 --> 1:57:51.320]  see the homeless people so they were busting people from the Cape into my
[1:57:51.320 --> 1:57:55.080]  particular city and just dropping them off and I'm already seeing easy legals
[1:57:55.080 --> 1:58:00.840]  from the border already coming up here and I can't get nothing started because
[1:58:00.840 --> 1:58:06.440]  I know the political spectrum in my area and I tried to get involved and they
[1:58:06.440 --> 1:58:13.920]  accented me well that's the thing once they always say hey you know don't even try to run for office in California because it's election fraud they've
[1:58:13.920 --> 1:58:19.000]  got it sewn up but then things like recalls work really well because the
[1:58:19.000 --> 1:58:21.800]  general public actually hates the governor I mean I know a lot of people
[1:58:21.800 --> 1:58:25.320]  that are actually liberals that now hate the Democratic Party and actually hate
[1:58:25.320 --> 1:58:30.440]  no some just like you saw triple the number of blacks voting for Trump so
[1:58:30.440 --> 1:58:34.920]  again it makes them look strong they've got Massachusetts and Connecticut sewn
[1:58:34.920 --> 1:58:38.720]  up but really that's a sign of their weakness I was just up in Connecticut
[1:58:38.720 --> 1:58:42.960]  a month and a half ago and I thought because I'm so demonized up there the
[1:58:42.960 --> 1:58:46.600]  people hate me people were shaking my hand everywhere pat me on the back I
[1:58:46.600 --> 1:58:50.800]  was in restaurants busy bars eating food people were you know waving at me
[1:58:50.800 --> 1:58:55.960]  buying my food and just love and loving that I was there so but but I
[1:58:55.960 --> 1:59:01.960]  understand there's those that serve the political system where you are and they
[1:59:01.960 --> 1:59:05.480]  they want to bully you and try to keep you in submission yeah there it is that
[1:59:05.480 --> 1:59:11.160]  East Coast states in the north five new England states have best vaccine rates
[1:59:11.160 --> 1:59:15.960]  in the US but herd immunity doesn't look promising I mean what a cult of just
[1:59:15.960 --> 1:59:19.880]  submissive people that all do with their tolls very very sad it's very very
[1:59:19.880 --> 1:59:25.480]  un-American alright thank you so much Ken when we come back we're gonna take
[1:59:25.480 --> 1:59:29.760]  four calls in this next segment we're gonna talk to Stephen we're gonna talk
[1:59:29.760 --> 1:59:34.400]  to text we talked to Dave to Casey David John Matt Jim and others I'm Alan
[1:59:34.400 --> 1:59:40.160]  Jones and again I know you're all awake folks tune in but remember your friends
[1:59:40.160 --> 1:59:43.720]  and family your neighbors aren't don't get mad at them it's a process just keep
[1:59:43.720 --> 1:59:50.880]  reaching out 14 months ago I told you that the global lockdown was gonna kill
[1:59:50.880 --> 1:59:54.240]  tens of millions of people by starvation and was gonna cause a global
[1:59:54.240 --> 1:59:58.840]  depression in the first world and now it has there was a no-brainer then that you
[1:59:58.840 --> 2:00:03.480]  should get high-quality storeable food and save it because it is insurance you
[2:00:03.480 --> 2:00:07.600]  could eat and with all the inflation we knew was coming that was one way to be
[2:00:07.600 --> 2:00:12.200]  inflation a lot of you listened you did a great job some of you didn't now is the
[2:00:12.200 --> 2:00:16.680]  time to take action before food prices only continue to increase every index
[2:00:16.680 --> 2:00:21.240]  shows it it's basically a guarantee barring a miracle and we wish it wasn't
[2:00:21.240 --> 2:00:25.680]  the case but let's make lemonade out of these limits for only a few days more
[2:00:25.680 --> 2:00:31.680]  until next Wednesday May 12th you can get 2020 prices still at prepare with
[2:00:31.680 --> 2:00:35.800]  alex.com and then the prices are gonna have to go back to what they were still
[2:00:35.800 --> 2:00:39.160]  lower than most major competitors and the food is the highest quality you're
[2:00:39.160 --> 2:00:44.160]  gonna find prepare with alex.com take action now prepare with alex.com
[2:00:44.160 --> 2:01:00.440]  secure your food while you still can if you are receiving this transmission you
[2:01:00.440 --> 2:01:06.400]  are the resistance if you are receiving this transmission you are the
[2:01:06.400 --> 2:01:15.280]  resistance. Live from the info wars.com studios it's alex jones well we've come
[2:01:15.280 --> 2:01:20.040]  a long way they're having to admit the masks don't protect you they're having to admit the vaccines don't protect you they're
[2:01:20.040 --> 2:01:24.240]  dangerous they're having to admit that Bill Gates and Fauci were behind the
[2:01:24.240 --> 2:01:28.320]  will hon lab with the chai comms that's mainstream news I mean this is a real
[2:01:28.320 --> 2:01:33.400]  fight going on ladies and gentlemen and as the public sees that you're not gonna
[2:01:33.400 --> 2:01:36.360]  have prosperity under Joe Biden you're gonna have bankruptcy and enslavement
[2:01:36.360 --> 2:01:42.800]  and hyperinflation their only hope is to trigger racial conflict this summer to
[2:01:42.800 --> 2:01:47.240]  blame civil unrest because of food prices and every other commodity price
[2:01:47.240 --> 2:01:55.400]  coming up on that civil unrest on racial issues instead of the economy that
[2:01:55.400 --> 2:01:59.560]  that's their big move worldwide they want to use the unrest because of food
[2:01:59.560 --> 2:02:04.280]  price increases like during the Arab Spring 10 years ago to bring in their
[2:02:04.280 --> 2:02:08.160]  globalist revolution but if people point out it's the globalist behind it it'll
[2:02:08.160 --> 2:02:13.280]  backfire on them so it's critical now to get ahead of the economic crisis to get
[2:02:13.280 --> 2:02:17.240]  ahead of the scarcity to get ahead of the starving third world which that you
[2:02:17.240 --> 2:02:21.240]  will then organize and use as an invasion force as I've been warning you
[2:02:21.240 --> 2:02:27.480]  since February of last year of this master plan how many months is that
[2:02:27.480 --> 2:02:33.160]  well we're already what six months into this year hard to believe almost six
[2:02:33.160 --> 2:02:40.600]  months into this year so it just makes the heads and we're talking 14 15 months
[2:02:40.600 --> 2:02:46.760]  since last February and so again we shouldn't just sit here and go along with
[2:02:46.760 --> 2:02:50.520]  the mainstream media narrative that didn't tell you this 14 months ago or
[2:02:50.520 --> 2:02:54.000]  six months ago suddenly oh there is a bunch of inflation everything's going
[2:02:54.000 --> 2:03:01.400]  up in price and they say well what's causing under all the newscasts oh we
[2:03:01.400 --> 2:03:05.760]  don't know and then the Chamber of Commerce and others point out the
[2:03:05.760 --> 2:03:12.680]  truth not that they're perfect it helps us up China that hey if you give everybody
[2:03:12.680 --> 2:03:17.560]  free money they don't have to work and so there's less productivity and more
[2:03:17.560 --> 2:03:21.040]  money that's more money chasing fewer goods that's the perfect storm for
[2:03:21.040 --> 2:03:26.280]  massive inflation not just inflation but a stagnating economy with less goods
[2:03:26.280 --> 2:03:33.200]  with inflation is that going to happen but if you have a lockdown you have such
[2:03:33.200 --> 2:03:37.760]  a depression and nobody's buying anything that can mask it but once the
[2:03:37.760 --> 2:03:42.440]  lockdowns over it's gonna race and that's what we're now seeing happen and
[2:03:42.440 --> 2:03:46.160]  again that stars the third world to death and I harp on that and another
[2:03:46.160 --> 2:03:50.120]  third world to most people is like a another planet but it's right next door
[2:03:50.120 --> 2:03:54.600]  to us that's where the raw materials come from when they get laid off from the
[2:03:54.600 --> 2:04:03.480]  mine or the farm or the flower production farm they starve to death and the able
[2:04:03.480 --> 2:04:07.240]  body men flee and break into your country and then they get organized into
[2:04:07.240 --> 2:04:15.800]  being political operatives so let's take your phone calls right now up next is
[2:04:15.800 --> 2:04:20.240]  Stephen in California on Communist China and all the big news coming out
[2:04:20.240 --> 2:04:25.120]  thanks for calling hey there Alex how are you all right brother go ahead well
[2:04:25.120 --> 2:04:29.480]  I after all the bombshells in the past about a year and a half it still blows
[2:04:29.480 --> 2:04:33.400]  my mind that people can't put together the study on how to convince the
[2:04:33.400 --> 2:04:39.320]  population to take vaccines I'm 22 years old I was a Stanford student lucky
[2:04:39.320 --> 2:04:42.920]  enough but you know I had to take some time off because of this you know the
[2:04:42.920 --> 2:04:48.560]  imposition on the curriculum you know yet leftism inserted into the biology
[2:04:48.560 --> 2:04:54.760]  classes astrology or astronomy classes it's absolutely ridiculous for those
[2:04:54.760 --> 2:04:59.320]  that don't know a bunch of universities Yale Harvard Stanford others were
[2:04:59.320 --> 2:05:04.280]  hired to come up with psychological warfare programs to get the public to
[2:05:04.280 --> 2:05:09.120]  take the vaccines doesn't look like it went too well and not at all and you
[2:05:09.120 --> 2:05:13.280]  know I was lucky enough to have a few professors there with some reality left
[2:05:13.280 --> 2:05:17.680]  in them and you know they were discussing with me privately about how you
[2:05:17.680 --> 2:05:21.320]  know funding comes from these private entities and you know the funding
[2:05:21.320 --> 2:05:25.560]  really determines what the science ends up saying it's not as objective as a
[2:05:25.560 --> 2:05:29.360]  lot of people are brought up to think let's become this cult where you know
[2:05:29.360 --> 2:05:33.040]  the funders determine the outcome of every study and it just and you're not
[2:05:33.040 --> 2:05:38.680]  supposed to question the quote science but science is all about questioning I
[2:05:38.680 --> 2:05:43.840]  mean Bill Guy the science guy says that X and Y chromosomes don't matter now
[2:05:43.840 --> 2:05:47.860]  he's actually gone back and edited videos he did in the 90s to take that out
[2:05:47.860 --> 2:05:52.520]  and to say that there is hundreds of sexes did you know that he absolutely
[2:05:52.520 --> 2:05:56.000]  like you it's just this gaslighting so anybody with a head on their shoulders
[2:05:56.000 --> 2:06:00.560]  just can't believe what's going on and it you know the same thing with TV and
[2:06:00.560 --> 2:06:04.120]  movies you know being brought up as a young man it's just you know looking
[2:06:04.120 --> 2:06:08.560]  back I can see the social conditioning that's just instilled in everything it's
[2:06:08.560 --> 2:06:12.840]  absolutely devastating to you know young people that are trying to figure out
[2:06:12.840 --> 2:06:17.760]  I you know I saw a great video from Thomas Sowell yesterday and he mentioned
[2:06:17.760 --> 2:06:21.800]  that young students they're taught now to have views they're not taught to you
[2:06:21.800 --> 2:06:26.400]  know take facts in they're taught to have views on issues that people who
[2:06:26.400 --> 2:06:30.800]  would look careers that's right Western idea of egalitarianism and having
[2:06:30.800 --> 2:06:34.200]  highly educated informed people in a classical education is threatening to
[2:06:34.200 --> 2:06:37.400]  oligarchs that want slaves and so now we're being taught superstition and
[2:06:37.400 --> 2:06:42.080]  and mindless ignorance where now they won't even teach chromosomes they're
[2:06:42.080 --> 2:06:45.520]  saying in the new sixth grade curriculum coming up in California and
[2:06:45.520 --> 2:06:49.440]  Netflix again has removed it from Bill Nye the science guy they should call
[2:06:49.440 --> 2:06:56.560]  Steve all right let's talk to Tex in Kentucky Tex welcome yes thank you for
[2:06:56.560 --> 2:06:59.920]  taking me very important to tell you these two things I'll say this quick as
[2:06:59.920 --> 2:07:04.520]  I can first you hold the key to being able to take care of this problem if you
[2:07:04.520 --> 2:07:10.200]  take your global enslavement book and put it in all languages and we introduce
[2:07:10.200 --> 2:07:16.360]  this to the world to all countries because with the world with us only
[2:07:16.360 --> 2:07:21.040]  can this stop all this from happening the second thing is Obama's in charge of
[2:07:21.040 --> 2:07:25.040]  this I don't care what anybody said but when you went to Notre Dame and he made
[2:07:25.040 --> 2:07:29.800]  sure that the crucifix of Jesus was covered before he would go in and take
[2:07:29.800 --> 2:07:35.080]  that award I think we need to make a lot of crucifixes the same one that
[2:07:35.080 --> 2:07:39.800]  Notre Dame and have them everywhere on billboards and all if that bothers him
[2:07:39.800 --> 2:07:44.160]  let's use it as much as we can Alex and they have burned thousands of churches
[2:07:44.160 --> 2:07:51.440]  in France the Muslims have and I remember that when Obama when I first heard
[2:07:51.440 --> 2:07:54.720]  that years ago I didn't believe it I looked it up he demanded a cross be
[2:07:54.720 --> 2:07:59.280]  covered I mean that that is what does that tell you notice Biden just canceled
[2:07:59.280 --> 2:08:05.840]  the National Day of Prayer well if we get out and we get all these crosses out
[2:08:05.840 --> 2:08:11.200]  we're gonna put them on billboards every Democrat event that they have we have
[2:08:11.200 --> 2:08:15.000]  people with signs in that carrying them I'm telling it it'll really make it an
[2:08:15.000 --> 2:08:18.880]  effect now I agree I was thinking about come out with a t-shirt with a cross on
[2:08:18.880 --> 2:08:24.000]  it just because it makes them so mad billboard t-shirts and all whatever we
[2:08:24.000 --> 2:08:28.080]  can even on vehicles on the side of vehicles because I think they'll actually
[2:08:28.080 --> 2:08:33.560]  run I think that it will actually affect them so much they'll be scared and they
[2:08:33.560 --> 2:08:37.560]  won't want to set up a different place and that's good if we put them on the
[2:08:37.560 --> 2:08:42.760]  run but your book your movie is the answer we got to let you know I feel
[2:08:42.760 --> 2:08:46.600]  good when I see a cross it's a powerful symbol and I just don't know why
[2:08:46.600 --> 2:08:51.640]  there's so I mean I imagine that demon in them hates that Christ is God and that
[2:08:51.640 --> 2:08:55.760]  Christ sacrifice himself it is risen again I mean they really hate that don't
[2:08:55.760 --> 2:09:00.400]  they because it's a symbol of the fact that they're losers yeah but what did the
[2:09:00.400 --> 2:09:05.720]  night's of the round table use right then they put that under shields yes when
[2:09:05.720 --> 2:09:11.720]  they went well there was a reason why I think we know it I agree with you brother
[2:09:11.720 --> 2:09:16.080]  that we should go over the whole line of shirts that have that had the crusader
[2:09:16.080 --> 2:09:20.920]  cross that have the all of it absolutely brother we actually have shirts that are
[2:09:20.920 --> 2:09:25.520]  from Paul Watson's website the summit.news t-shirts because Paul came out
[2:09:25.520 --> 2:09:29.280]  with these they're like a pelican he thinks it's a symbol of I mean Paul's
[2:09:29.280 --> 2:09:33.160]  got his own taste and he's a smart guy so he's got his pelican t-shirts that I
[2:09:33.160 --> 2:09:39.120]  guess he actually sells some of but I came out with the summit news with the
[2:09:39.120 --> 2:09:43.800]  cross of King George on the right shoulder as a crusader cross and then
[2:09:43.800 --> 2:09:48.760]  it's got summit.news and on it and it's a nice looking good-looking shirt it's
[2:09:48.760 --> 2:09:53.320]  kind of on there and so we're gonna come out with a another one for info wars
[2:09:53.320 --> 2:09:59.200]  very very soon I've meant to do that the shirts 1776 at info wars store.com
[2:09:59.200 --> 2:10:04.600]  else have one that has the British flag on it as well which is very triggering
[2:10:04.600 --> 2:10:08.000]  to the leftist that's been the British Empire that's the globalist but I mean
[2:10:08.000 --> 2:10:13.640]  the British flag is a great flag it's a symbol of the King George cross and then
[2:10:13.640 --> 2:10:17.320]  the Scottish cross together it's a symbol of England and Scotland unified
[2:10:17.320 --> 2:10:21.720]  that's what the Confederate flag is to folks so you know it's a racist it's a
[2:10:21.720 --> 2:10:26.560]  Scottish flag because most Scots were like the main group in the in the south
[2:10:26.560 --> 2:10:32.200]  all right ladies and gentlemen we'll be right back on the other side info wars

[2:12:50.640 --> 2:13:15.640]  alex jones show
[2:13:20.640 --> 2:13:34.800]  man I love taking your phone calls you take us in so many different amazing
[2:13:34.800 --> 2:13:38.800]  directions we're taking your calls the order they are received almost live
[2:13:38.800 --> 2:13:43.800]  broadcasts let's go ahead and talk to Dave in the great nation of Canada still
[2:13:43.800 --> 2:13:48.720]  under new world order martial law to a great extent thanks for calling what
[2:13:48.720 --> 2:13:53.200]  is your take on it coming out the Communist China indeed with Bill Gates
[2:13:53.200 --> 2:13:59.880]  and with Fauci cooked up this weapon with with Klaus Schwab I mean it's all
[2:13:59.880 --> 2:14:03.560]  coming out a weapon to lock down Western economies and give China global
[2:14:03.560 --> 2:14:06.760]  domination through economic control that's what their Army War College was
[2:14:06.760 --> 2:14:11.440]  preparing that's clearly what they were doing with Fauci the same year this is a
[2:14:11.440 --> 2:14:15.720]  big big deal because it means a large arm of the power structure including even
[2:14:15.720 --> 2:14:22.320]  a Washington Post that chef Bezos has decided to basically switch sides in my
[2:14:22.320 --> 2:14:26.200]  view what do you make of this it's the flu it's always been the flu common
[2:14:26.200 --> 2:14:32.920]  common nomenclature for flu viruses co for corona be for virus ID and a two
[2:14:32.920 --> 2:14:38.760]  digit number like COVID-06 these by Rai are always described as novel remember
[2:14:38.760 --> 2:14:43.480]  that term symptoms include highly contagious affect the function causes
[2:14:43.480 --> 2:14:48.240]  fever and coughing and very dangerous when the elderly are involved in those
[2:14:48.240 --> 2:14:52.880]  cases resulting in death sound familiar flu symptoms then there were the
[2:14:52.880 --> 2:14:58.720]  descriptions of people convulsing video workers welding doors tails of bat
[2:14:58.720 --> 2:15:03.080]  soup I can show you videos of workers welding I can get to someone to convulse
[2:15:03.080 --> 2:15:07.280]  right in front of you remember Big Lebowski I can get you a toe and the
[2:15:07.280 --> 2:15:13.600]  conspiracies China and who and what the Wuhan Technical University the CIA hold
[2:15:13.600 --> 2:15:17.880]  on just a second before me so what you're saying is the virus doesn't even
[2:15:17.880 --> 2:15:23.000]  exist at all and they just took regular flu deaths and car accidents and put the
[2:15:23.000 --> 2:15:28.760]  number we know they did that too but the the the Australians that the Indians and
[2:15:28.760 --> 2:15:33.520]  others did scan it it is a manufactured virus so gates and others can own it they
[2:15:33.520 --> 2:15:38.840]  are doing biological training at that facility they did use the fear of it to
[2:15:38.840 --> 2:15:43.000]  shut down our economy so coming out exposing that they did it for that
[2:15:43.000 --> 2:15:47.560]  reason will bring them down and discredit all the lockdowns and the power
[2:15:47.560 --> 2:15:52.880]  grab they got out of it so I think that's really the big issue here one more
[2:15:52.880 --> 2:15:58.160]  thing as for damned statistics they always talk about cases now before it was
[2:15:58.160 --> 2:16:05.920]  death but now it's cases cases cases and it's a deadly yeah 0.03 or whatever
[2:16:05.920 --> 2:16:10.320]  death rate it's an intelligence test no you're right I appreciate your call the
[2:16:10.320 --> 2:16:15.200]  whole thing has been alive from the start and it is an intelligence test but
[2:16:15.200 --> 2:16:18.680]  it's not just an intelligence test of those in a trance who believe the lies
[2:16:18.680 --> 2:16:22.360]  and go along with it it's an intelligence test of us are we gonna go out and
[2:16:22.360 --> 2:16:27.600]  warn people because that's really the issue I mean the numbers here of people
[2:16:27.600 --> 2:16:30.960]  getting sick and dying from the vaccine is just staggering there's a big article
[2:16:30.960 --> 2:16:35.280]  on info wars.com that deals with this that the deaths from the vaccines and
[2:16:35.280 --> 2:16:40.680]  the real catastrophe everybody needs to share that report I come to you because
[2:16:40.680 --> 2:16:44.760]  you're the power folks you are everything when you take action nothing can
[2:16:44.760 --> 2:16:49.320]  stop you when you don't take action the enemy wins so share those articles from
[2:16:49.320 --> 2:16:52.760]  info wars.com and share those videos from band.video because you're having a
[2:16:52.760 --> 2:16:55.880]  huge effect and I see you out there doing it and I salute and thank you all
[2:16:55.880 --> 2:17:01.000]  and say keep it up but again you can't share band.video on Facebook or
[2:17:01.000 --> 2:17:04.480]  Twitter or a lot of other places they ban the URL that's all we have ban this
[2:17:04.480 --> 2:17:09.280]  dot TV and they haven't banned that URL yet I'm sure they will soon but it's been
[2:17:09.280 --> 2:17:12.520]  good for about three months they were banning stuff during the election after
[2:17:12.520 --> 2:17:16.680]  every week remember all those different names we had but it's the same index the
[2:17:16.680 --> 2:17:20.880]  same website the same videos just different URLs on the videos so you can
[2:17:20.880 --> 2:17:26.040]  share them when you go to ban this dot TV that takes you right to band.video but
[2:17:26.040 --> 2:17:29.440]  it puts a different link in there to get around the sensors one of the stop
[2:17:29.440 --> 2:17:34.640]  gaps all right let's go ahead and take another call let's go ahead dr. Casey in
[2:17:34.640 --> 2:17:41.440]  Wisconsin Casey go ahead what's up mr. J every time I hear you ran about secret
[2:17:41.440 --> 2:17:47.200]  military technologies Chinese chimeras biotech nanobots cloning all that down
[2:17:47.200 --> 2:17:54.440]  the rabbit hole stuff I wonder about Ben Rich quote he who was head of Lockheed
[2:17:54.440 --> 2:18:01.920]  Martin's skunk work labs he said quote we already have the means to travel among
[2:18:01.920 --> 2:18:07.440]  the stars but these technologies are locked up in black projects and it would
[2:18:07.440 --> 2:18:13.840]  take an act of God to get them out to benefit humanity anything you can imagine
[2:18:13.840 --> 2:18:19.040]  we already know how to do end quote I believe all this we're seeing especially
[2:18:19.040 --> 2:18:25.120]  with the coronavirus and even with Trump and plus ultra stuff it's part of that
[2:18:25.120 --> 2:18:30.360]  unlocking and act of God you want me to keep going no I totally agree with what
[2:18:30.360 --> 2:18:38.200]  you're saying I also had I wanted to hear your thoughts on a possibility of
[2:18:38.200 --> 2:18:43.480]  maybe Elon Musk sharing rocket secrets with China and you remind me of Frank
[2:18:43.480 --> 2:18:51.640]  in Disney's 2015 film Tomorrowland with its epic Eiffel Tower scene and lastly I
[2:18:51.640 --> 2:18:57.680]  think you should also look into Tyler Perry the actor's coronavirus social
[2:18:57.680 --> 2:19:03.720]  research experiments he did and how Hollywood is indirectly helping with the
[2:19:03.720 --> 2:19:11.400]  coronavirus lockdown beyond propaganda do you remember in 2019 early 2019 at the
[2:19:11.400 --> 2:19:19.220]  big international runway model fashion event the winner was called COVID-19
[2:19:19.220 --> 2:19:25.080]  spelled the same wearing a medical uniform and a mask they always tell you
[2:19:25.080 --> 2:19:28.960]  what they're gonna do beforehand it's called lesser magic and they believe
[2:19:28.960 --> 2:19:33.920]  if they tell you internationally what they're gonna do and then are still
[2:19:33.920 --> 2:19:38.920]  able to do it that it metaphysically gives them more power totally totally and
[2:19:38.920 --> 2:19:43.200]  how you were press the end even before that everybody remembers how you just
[2:19:43.200 --> 2:19:48.520]  picked out of the ether the whole cobra stick you were doing for so long where
[2:19:48.520 --> 2:19:52.480]  cobra is known to wear the mask that was like the cobra thing and you were
[2:19:52.480 --> 2:19:57.120]  going on and on about cobra for so long I don't know how you do that you just
[2:19:57.120 --> 2:20:00.240]  pull that out of the ether well no I was I was saying the left we're gonna wear
[2:20:00.240 --> 2:20:03.600]  masks and then they basically are Cobra yeah and that's what this is is it's
[2:20:03.600 --> 2:20:07.080]  they're masked men the police are masked their identity said and it means the
[2:20:07.080 --> 2:20:11.320]  cult has come for you it's all very very serious God bless you Casey I appreciate
[2:20:11.320 --> 2:20:17.160]  your call let's jam in one more Brian in Florida go ahead sir hey how's it going
[2:20:17.160 --> 2:20:23.160]  Alex good sir welcome good just my grandfather was OSS just curious
[2:20:23.160 --> 2:20:28.800]  everything you said he said what you what are you personally doing I live in
[2:20:28.800 --> 2:20:33.080]  Florida it's a good state but just curious what what you think we should do
[2:20:33.080 --> 2:20:36.800]  as far as property get out of the city well that's a big question say there
[2:20:36.800 --> 2:20:42.960]  Bryant did you say your grandfather was in the OSS yes yes sir yeah well you
[2:20:42.960 --> 2:20:45.760]  probably tell me what does when we come back but I guess that's the group out of
[2:20:45.760 --> 2:20:48.800]  the British intelligence that work with the US during World War two and that's
[2:20:48.800 --> 2:20:53.680]  what the CIA later got set up out of but you're asking what I'm doing man I don't
[2:20:53.680 --> 2:21:01.360]  have that big a means contrary to what the media says and but I am selling my
[2:21:01.360 --> 2:21:04.440]  house here in Austin I'm getting ready to put it on the market and I'm gonna try
[2:21:04.440 --> 2:21:07.040]  to get some small play so we got a little bit of property outside town but
[2:21:07.040 --> 2:21:10.080]  there's no house on it yet we're putting in solar and a well and all that
[2:21:10.080 --> 2:21:17.120]  that's been done and so I mean I just plan to get a double-wide trailer and in
[2:21:17.120 --> 2:21:22.080]  a well and a place to live out in the country and I mean that's about it and
[2:21:22.080 --> 2:21:25.920]  I've got some friends that are private pilots and stuff that you know that I'm
[2:21:25.920 --> 2:21:29.080]  friends with that have said that they'll help fly me out of here there's a total
[2:21:29.080 --> 2:21:33.400]  collapse in central Texas but I'm not like you know these these globalists
[2:21:33.400 --> 2:21:36.320]  have all these private jets and all this stuff at their fingertips but if you
[2:21:36.320 --> 2:21:39.240]  want to ask what I would do I'll try to give you my view when we come back
[2:21:39.240 --> 2:21:43.160]  that's a big question Brian stay there we'll be right back
[2:21:44.320 --> 2:21:49.560]  I'm not gonna sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off the
[2:21:49.560 --> 2:21:54.520]  successes info versus that if you're paying attention you know we've done
[2:21:54.520 --> 2:22:01.240]  together but I'll tell you this the technocrats are really upping their game
[2:22:01.240 --> 2:22:06.000]  and they are trying to destroy all independent forms of media they're
[2:22:06.000 --> 2:22:10.480]  trying to shudder and silence a human resistance so now is the time to
[2:22:10.480 --> 2:22:13.560]  understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate
[2:22:13.560 --> 2:22:17.120]  everything you warned your friends and family about it's around to be true so
[2:22:17.120 --> 2:22:22.280]  it's now that your credibility is way up the power structure to silence those of
[2:22:22.280 --> 2:22:28.880]  us that they can't but it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us we
[2:22:28.880 --> 2:22:34.920]  have the power but the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech we
[2:22:34.920 --> 2:22:38.760]  have to make sure that we find hard right now to make sure that long dark
[2:22:38.760 --> 2:22:43.560]  night doesn't come so be the polar bears you are
[2:22:45.440 --> 2:22:50.600]  cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left it can be very
[2:22:50.600 --> 2:22:55.440]  stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept if you have a family member
[2:22:55.440 --> 2:23:00.040]  suffering from this degenerative mental condition buy them a bottle of ultimate
[2:23:00.040 --> 2:23:05.160]  fish oil from info wars store dot com studies have suggested that fish oils
[2:23:05.160 --> 2:23:09.600]  and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure decrease
[2:23:09.600 --> 2:23:14.520]  triglyceride levels decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide a soothing
[2:23:14.520 --> 2:23:19.960]  reduction in inflammatory responses and joints and the digestive system recent
[2:23:19.960 --> 2:23:26.040]  studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune
[2:23:26.040 --> 2:23:31.480]  function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells it worked
[2:23:31.480 --> 2:23:37.000]  for my family and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual
[2:23:37.000 --> 2:23:42.280]  facts that pertain to reality get your ultimate fish oil for a friend family

[2:23:56.560 --> 2:24:00.600]  down I have to either reformulate or I have to lower the quality to get a lot
[2:24:00.600 --> 2:24:04.120]  of these and so that's why we don't have a lot of products in that's why info

[2:24:52.920 --> 2:24:57.040]  such a complex civilization with so many billions of moving parts that when
[2:24:57.040 --> 2:25:02.040]  you shut down the first world it causes a chain reaction that will devastate the
[2:25:02.040 --> 2:25:05.960]  third world and really hurt the first world well now you're hearing about gas
[2:25:05.960 --> 2:25:09.440]  shortages all over the United States that's because the companies and the
[2:25:09.440 --> 2:25:13.200]  systems of the drivers that can barely get the job done before delivering gas
[2:25:13.200 --> 2:25:17.000]  have been shut down plus the keystone pipeline's been shut down along with

[2:26:19.480 --> 2:26:35.440]  to the basics of love let's go to look at the end of this successful life
[2:26:35.440 --> 2:27:04.660]  we've got a really interesting expert on the markets you'll recognize one
[2:27:04.660 --> 2:27:11.280]  fox fox business Drew Mason's me with us next hour in studio and we have got a
[2:27:11.280 --> 2:27:15.600]  lot of news on the markets a lot of news on gold and silver you've got zero heads
[2:27:15.600 --> 2:27:22.360]  here the pivot to gold has begun gold gains on hopes for low rates post bleak
[2:27:22.360 --> 2:27:28.240]  us job data we'll talk about crypto we'll talk about all of it coming up but we
[2:27:28.240 --> 2:27:33.880]  just had a caller we go back to him Brian in Florida who was asking me what
[2:27:33.880 --> 2:27:45.000]  I'm gonna do and I gotta tell you I've been 100% offense fighting the
[2:27:45.000 --> 2:27:55.600]  globalist I've been 100% trying to at the top stop what they're doing to protect
[2:27:55.600 --> 2:27:59.440]  myself and my family and protect your family because an ounce of prevention is
[2:27:59.440 --> 2:28:04.960]  worth a pound of cure and so I knew the longer the lockdowns went globally the
[2:28:04.960 --> 2:28:08.400]  more the financial collapse would be intense the more as they threw more free
[2:28:08.400 --> 2:28:13.480]  money out there the more that would cause scarcity as more dollars chase fewer
[2:28:13.480 --> 2:28:19.520]  commodities fewer items there were big debates about whether it would be a
[2:28:19.520 --> 2:28:22.920]  depression or whether it would be inflation I said looks to me like I said
[2:28:22.920 --> 2:28:27.480]  this with a lot of economic guests on last year looks like stagflation to me
[2:28:27.480 --> 2:28:32.960]  they say oh no no you're not gonna have depression and inflation well if you
[2:28:32.960 --> 2:28:38.680]  don't have a job and there's less people working and there's less items but
[2:28:38.680 --> 2:28:42.280]  more money that's what happened in Germany that's what happened in Weimar
[2:28:42.280 --> 2:28:46.360]  Republic what happened in Zimbabwe Africa I don't think it'll be that bad but
[2:28:46.360 --> 2:28:49.840]  it's certainly gonna be serious once people figure out there's inflation
[2:28:49.840 --> 2:28:54.720]  everybody starts raising prices I mean I've needed to raise prices but I don't
[2:28:54.720 --> 2:28:58.800]  want to charge people more but our raw materials for everything we sell whether
[2:28:58.800 --> 2:29:06.680]  it's t-shirts or DVDs or books or supplements have gone way up and as
[2:29:06.680 --> 2:29:13.440]  there's less of a supply chain a lot of times you just can't have items and so
[2:29:13.440 --> 2:29:16.880]  that means that diversity of the economy starts to go away and that's where
[2:29:16.880 --> 2:29:21.240]  people had jobs in the manufacturing and in the service economy but even though
[2:29:21.240 --> 2:29:24.440]  heavy manufacturing went away in this country predominantly we still had
[2:29:24.440 --> 2:29:29.760]  light manufacturing making clothes putting together supplements food
[2:29:29.760 --> 2:29:35.920]  processing you know all sorts of things auto repair computer repair but as
[2:29:35.920 --> 2:29:39.160]  there's no chips that are gonna be available I mean there's just so many
[2:29:39.160 --> 2:29:43.000]  problems worked into this and that's what the plow Schwab said we want to have
[2:29:43.000 --> 2:29:48.600]  an economic collapse we want to post industrial world where they have all the
[2:29:48.600 --> 2:29:53.000]  money but there's no real complexity in industry left the economy is very thin
[2:29:53.000 --> 2:30:01.400]  and very easy to control so that's what's going on here and so here are
[2:30:01.400 --> 2:30:05.560]  some of those headlines prices are rising everywhere you look CNN says
[2:30:05.560 --> 2:30:10.000]  gleefully I mean just three months ago there were news articles saying Alex
[2:30:10.000 --> 2:30:15.560]  Jones is a fair monger he's telling listeners that prices are gonna go up so
[2:30:15.560 --> 2:30:18.240]  first they demonize me and then anything they want to demonize they go
[2:30:18.240 --> 2:30:23.880]  Jones is saying that but they don't understand they've lost credibility so
[2:30:23.880 --> 2:30:26.840]  when people attack me it only makes me look better to the public because the
[2:30:26.840 --> 2:30:30.680]  public's figured out they're a pack of liars
[2:30:30.840 --> 2:30:37.360]  continuing higher prices leave consumers feeling the pinch Wall Street
[2:30:37.360 --> 2:30:41.160]  Journal you're not a human being you're not a father a mother a son or daughter a
[2:30:41.160 --> 2:30:44.520]  grandmother a grandfather a brother a sister you're not a Christian you're not
[2:30:44.520 --> 2:30:49.040]  an American you're a consumer and you're a human resource and they say you're
[2:30:49.040 --> 2:30:53.240]  not essential stop letting them use these terms you're a consumer how about
[2:30:53.240 --> 2:30:58.520]  you're a human being what will you do when inflation forces us households to
[2:30:58.520 --> 2:31:04.200]  spend 40% of their incomes on food that's what's projected again and they go
[2:31:04.200 --> 2:31:09.800]  through it an excellent long article at zero hedge us declare a state of
[2:31:09.800 --> 2:31:14.360]  emergency to keep gasoline flowing after colonial fails to restart hacked pipe
[2:31:14.360 --> 2:31:18.880]  line they're holding it hostage both the data of the company and the company
[2:31:18.880 --> 2:31:23.280]  servers itself why would you have something like a complex gas pipeline
[2:31:23.280 --> 2:31:28.160]  out of refined fuel out of Texas all the way up the east coast maybe we can show
[2:31:28.160 --> 2:31:34.440]  some maps of that you notice what was delivering raw crude to Houston was
[2:31:34.440 --> 2:31:39.520]  supposed to be open by now the keystone pipeline but it's closed so you can't get
[2:31:39.520 --> 2:31:43.800]  the raw oil to it and it doesn't matter because you already have shortages and
[2:31:43.800 --> 2:31:50.760]  then you can't even be pumped see the background see the pattern there I would
[2:31:50.760 --> 2:31:53.840]  imagine it's probably the CIA director that's doing this not even the chai comms
[2:31:53.840 --> 2:31:57.400]  but he is a chai com operative us declare a state of emergency to keep
[2:31:57.400 --> 2:32:04.520]  gasoline flowing after colonial fails to restart hacked pipeline and it goes on
[2:32:04.520 --> 2:32:07.600]  and on and on you really hit that ship just wrecked on the accident with us
[2:32:07.600 --> 2:32:11.640]  canal really all this is just happening by accident here's what automakers are
[2:32:11.640 --> 2:32:16.120]  ditching high-tech features amidst unprecedented semi-shortages good there's
[2:32:16.120 --> 2:32:20.520]  too much high-tech crap the traction cars anyways so there's some good unseen
[2:32:20.520 --> 2:32:26.760]  areas of this but it's it's serious folks don't worry vasos has his new 417
[2:32:26.760 --> 2:32:31.960]  foot super yacht is a testament to the k-shaped recovery where the elites are
[2:32:31.960 --> 2:32:37.960]  all inflating the cost of super yachts and super jets and palatial hundred
[2:32:37.960 --> 2:32:42.960]  thousand fifty thousand acre properties but again they need that because there's
[2:32:42.960 --> 2:32:48.280]  a lockdown and they don't want to be around you so that's some of what's
[2:32:48.280 --> 2:32:51.640]  going on Brian what are you doing to protect yourself I mean this is such a
[2:32:51.640 --> 2:32:55.560]  big seismic thing I've tried to point out they're destroying the third world
[2:32:55.560 --> 2:32:59.240]  starving the debt than organize them as an invasion weapon that the UN also
[2:32:59.240 --> 2:33:03.960]  orchestrates and controls I mean we're really entering the end game here so I'm
[2:33:03.960 --> 2:33:09.520]  really just staying at the helm on air doing limited things if they try to lock
[2:33:09.520 --> 2:33:14.160]  down Austin to try to you know at some point be able to get out of the town I
[2:33:14.160 --> 2:33:17.480]  mean I literally have an armored vehicle if I need one because I knew in the
[2:33:17.480 --> 2:33:20.720]  future the left would attack anybody trying to report on what they do they've
[2:33:20.720 --> 2:33:25.440]  attacked the vehicle at least 50 times with hammers and bricks and everything
[2:33:25.440 --> 2:33:28.720]  else people said oh you're crazy you won't need that well we need that to
[2:33:28.720 --> 2:33:32.080]  report now to left I mean they're just slowly putting us into a destabilized
[2:33:32.080 --> 2:33:37.720]  position what do you think Brian well what I'm hearing I do luxury real estate
[2:33:37.720 --> 2:33:43.200]  here in Miami Beach a lot of the big money is putting money and and and hard
[2:33:43.200 --> 2:33:48.520]  assets like houses and whatnot obviously I don't I don't know the answers I'm
[2:33:48.520 --> 2:33:52.520]  just trying to understand what to do because I was sure I mean listen you're
[2:33:52.520 --> 2:33:56.840]  smart as I am or smarter absolutely the stock markets way overvalued if you
[2:33:56.840 --> 2:34:00.040]  know when to get out of it it's a great place and it's all inflationary and it's
[2:34:00.040 --> 2:34:03.720]  the leading edge of inflation as you can you know cash out of that before the
[2:34:03.720 --> 2:34:07.160]  inflation hits other places you got to decide when to do that that's just a
[2:34:07.160 --> 2:34:10.840]  speculative roller coaster with insiders making the money but absolutely
[2:34:10.840 --> 2:34:14.440]  real estate's always king look at what Bill Gates is doing buying up raw
[2:34:14.440 --> 2:34:18.880]  farmland across the US knowing raw commodities during the coming depression
[2:34:18.880 --> 2:34:22.040]  are going to be king with the food shortages so that's why I said a year
[2:34:22.040 --> 2:34:24.920]  ago when Bill Gates was buying up farmland I said folks I would get into
[2:34:24.920 --> 2:34:30.040]  horrible food and food production what do you think no absolutely I mean
[2:34:30.040 --> 2:34:34.560]  everything you've said my grandfather said from the OSS even even your
[2:34:34.560 --> 2:34:38.760]  products like my girlfriend was a model for years she had some toenail fungus
[2:34:38.760 --> 2:34:43.760]  she took the forgot what it what the supplement was it actually cured the
[2:34:43.760 --> 2:34:47.520]  her toenail everything you I've been listening to you for 15 years it's the
[2:34:47.520 --> 2:34:53.440]  first time I've called in I'm sorry I'm not very rehearsed here but I'm just
[2:34:53.440 --> 2:34:59.360]  terrified I want to get up I'm actually feel great though that listening to you
[2:34:59.360 --> 2:35:03.120]  I want to get property outside of the city I think that's where the main
[2:35:03.120 --> 2:35:09.480]  takeaways that I've gotten but but I take survival shield every day I mean
[2:35:09.480 --> 2:35:14.560]  everything you've said is is what my grandfather said that was in the OSS it's
[2:35:14.560 --> 2:35:18.480]  all come true so thank you so much I know you don't want to hear that but well
[2:35:18.480 --> 2:35:23.040]  no I mean but all I'm covering is history in the arc of of empires I mean what
[2:35:23.040 --> 2:35:27.640]  was your grandfather saying which about globalism world government to break down
[2:35:27.640 --> 2:35:34.960]  of the family destroying the family basically everything you the United
[2:35:34.960 --> 2:35:38.960]  Nations you spoke about this in the 70s I think you actually went on them on
[2:35:38.960 --> 2:35:42.520]  radio stations and everything and tried to get it out there my mom well God
[2:35:42.520 --> 2:35:48.640]  bless your grandfather we'll be right back the equation is very simple the
[2:35:48.640 --> 2:35:54.840]  mega banks control the media they control Big Pharma they control academia they
[2:35:54.840 --> 2:35:59.960]  control the military industrial complex they control big tech and everywhere
[2:35:59.960 --> 2:36:03.600]  that they have been in control in the third world they have established
[2:36:03.600 --> 2:36:09.200]  absolute total despotism and dehumanization it is the Western
[2:36:09.200 --> 2:36:14.320]  Christian idea of human freedom that ended slavery and then promoted women's
[2:36:14.320 --> 2:36:17.600]  rights and so much more that actually threatens them so because they can't
[2:36:17.600 --> 2:36:24.520]  defeat that empowering ethic they instead co-opted turn it upside down and use the
[2:36:24.520 --> 2:36:30.120]  idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free market that
[2:36:30.120 --> 2:36:34.280]  threatens their monopoly some control that's why they target info wars because
[2:36:34.280 --> 2:36:38.560]  we understand the keys to defeating them but the only way our transmission gets
[2:36:38.560 --> 2:36:43.640]  out is if you promote info wars and that video so we double your efforts we're

[2:42:57.320 --> 2:43:02.200]  talk to Larry in Florida he's actually called in on the topic I raised of Dr.
[2:43:02.200 --> 2:43:07.400]  Fauci COVID Australia why is this all coming out now give us your take Larry.
[2:43:07.400 --> 2:43:14.440]  Well first of all it's it's coming out now but if we listen to you it was out
[2:43:14.440 --> 2:43:19.200]  a couple of weeks after basically the COVID broke out and the Australians
[2:43:19.200 --> 2:43:23.200]  looked at it real early and said yeah it's lab it's lab and it's a homegrown
[2:43:23.200 --> 2:43:27.360]  and it's I mean not homegrown but it's not natural and it's bio-weapon and sure
[2:43:27.360 --> 2:43:31.400]  enough and I think one of the reasons it's coming out is they're feeling the
[2:43:31.400 --> 2:43:36.960]  heat the bad results on the vaccines are starting to roll out and in this group
[2:43:36.960 --> 2:43:41.400]  there's no loyalties so if they got a sacrifice Fauci at some point or they
[2:43:41.400 --> 2:43:46.120]  got a sacrifice others they'll do it move right on. You just said in 30 seconds
[2:43:46.120 --> 2:43:50.200]  when I said to now I've got diarrhea in the mouth exactly and so this
[2:43:50.200 --> 2:43:54.160]  is a victory overall that they've been forced to this point because their big
[2:43:54.160 --> 2:43:58.360]  global domination plan the wheels are coming off of it. Well we need more
[2:43:58.360 --> 2:44:01.800]  victory I mean I'm a couple of other things if I if I can suggest. Yes sir.
[2:44:01.800 --> 2:44:07.440]  One for for those of us that want to be out here and fight this crap got to stay
[2:44:07.440 --> 2:44:10.920]  healthy and you know you talk about all the minerals and vitamins and you're
[2:44:10.920 --> 2:44:15.160]  you're absolutely right and everybody that's out there should get a blood test
[2:44:15.160 --> 2:44:19.280]  and know what their vitamin D level is and make sure it's in the in the good
[2:44:19.280 --> 2:44:25.560]  range and second thing for those of us that are like my age I'm over 70 so I'm
[2:44:25.560 --> 2:44:30.080]  in that risk group but I'm not wearing a mask and I'm I'm in Florida so I'm
[2:44:30.080 --> 2:44:35.040]  going out and enjoying life I'm having my grandchildren over but I just signed up
[2:44:35.040 --> 2:44:38.560]  and I'm gonna be taking ivermectin in fact I have it in my house
[2:44:38.560 --> 2:44:43.240]  prophylactically and there's been a couple of really good doctors I mean
[2:44:43.240 --> 2:44:47.520]  people actually that are treating COVID patients and have done research and they
[2:44:47.520 --> 2:44:51.560]  basically you know they've done studies there's been enough studies out there you
[2:44:51.560 --> 2:44:56.200]  got you don't find them on Microsoft on you know on Google but how evil is it
[2:44:56.200 --> 2:44:59.560]  that they knew ivermectin and hydroxychloricone were basically a hundred
[2:44:59.560 --> 2:45:04.080]  percent you've taken preemptively and they kept it from me so they could give
[2:45:04.080 --> 2:45:08.360]  emergency authorization these franken shots that is that alone is crimes
[2:45:08.360 --> 2:45:13.320]  against humanity right there. Clearly and that's why they did it I mean if you
[2:45:13.320 --> 2:45:16.320]  look at it they couldn't have get if there were if they were admitting there
[2:45:16.320 --> 2:45:19.560]  was treatments out there that worked then they couldn't give emergency
[2:45:19.560 --> 2:45:23.520]  approval I mean they're based on their own regulations now you know they can
[2:45:23.520 --> 2:45:28.040]  change those but the you know just for the for the listeners you know if you
[2:45:28.040 --> 2:45:32.880]  want to know how to get it you go to frontlinedoctors.org yeah use duck duck
[2:45:32.880 --> 2:45:36.960]  or something else to find it and then just follow the prompts and it'll it'll
[2:45:36.960 --> 2:45:42.320]  cost you basically a telemedicine visit and then the ivermectin if you price
[2:45:42.320 --> 2:45:47.120]  shop it a 90-day supply is 24 bucks. Absolutely and that's why they didn't
[2:45:47.120 --> 2:45:51.000]  want that God bless you sir great points yeah some people are saying hey
[2:45:51.000 --> 2:45:54.880]  COVID-19 doesn't exist period and that's their right to say it no it's a real lab
[2:45:54.880 --> 2:45:58.840]  virus has incredible gain of function but if you don't have the deficiencies
[2:45:58.840 --> 2:46:01.680]  you're not gonna have a problem the problem is when you get older even if
[2:46:01.680 --> 2:46:04.440]  you're taking a regular allowance of vitamins minerals your guts don't
[2:46:04.440 --> 2:46:07.720]  absorb as well you got to take a lot more and then you got to check your liver
[2:46:07.720 --> 2:46:11.080]  and stuff because too many vitamins can be bad but basically your bullet proof
[2:46:11.080 --> 2:46:13.280]  if you've got all the vitamins and minerals in your body's absorbing them
[2:46:13.280 --> 2:46:15.720]  and that's why they don't want you knowing that because they want you living
[2:46:15.720 --> 2:46:19.040]  in fear and antivirus is gonna kill you if you don't have those things that's
[2:46:19.040 --> 2:46:22.320]  on the NIH website but they try to keep them ignorant but they're losing the
[2:46:22.320 --> 2:46:27.000]  fight they're losing the fight and that's really pissing them off the highest
[2:46:27.000 --> 2:46:30.280]  death rates are in the states and cities where they've had the longest lockdowns
[2:46:30.280 --> 2:46:34.480]  no kidding because you can be locked in your house with no sunlight and
[2:46:34.480 --> 2:46:37.400]  depressed and depression makes you get sick as well and you're gonna get sick
[2:46:37.400 --> 2:46:43.560]  from any virus virus is all over the place it's just data that's able to get
[2:46:43.560 --> 2:46:49.280]  in your cells and replicate that's all it is all right let's take another call
[2:46:49.280 --> 2:46:56.840]  here let's go ahead and talk to Scott in Alabama Scott go ahead hey Alex how are
[2:46:56.840 --> 2:47:00.800]  you man I just it's I'm seeing everything come out about Bill Gates and
[2:47:00.800 --> 2:47:05.480]  Jeffrey Epstein and the Chinese being involved with them with Fauci in the lab
[2:47:05.480 --> 2:47:09.880]  I mean they're in a lot of trouble yeah they are but I just don't think we're
[2:47:09.880 --> 2:47:13.760]  gonna win this fight I think we're right in the middle of that seven-year time of
[2:47:13.760 --> 2:47:19.880]  trouble and I started in 17 with the eclipse and if you count 42 months that
[2:47:19.880 --> 2:47:26.120]  puts Biden in office and the other eclipse would be in 2024 so who's the
[2:47:26.120 --> 2:47:35.800]  antichrist I'm thinking Pope well he sure acts like it I just bought a coin
[2:47:35.800 --> 2:47:43.960]  from 1985 showing John Paul 2 on the front and on the back it shows the
[2:47:43.960 --> 2:47:49.400]  entire map of the world with the planes going by with the chemtrails if that's
[2:47:49.400 --> 2:47:55.120]  not them admitting that they're behind everything I don't know what is well
[2:47:55.120 --> 2:47:58.000]  brother all I know is every major institution is being taken over by
[2:47:58.000 --> 2:48:03.360]  evil right now and the Bible is being fulfilled I don't know if it's 10 years
[2:48:03.360 --> 2:48:07.600]  100 years or six months but definitely we're seeing an antichrist system I
[2:48:07.600 --> 2:48:10.280]  mean I haven't played the clip yet did you know claus Schwab said we need a
[2:48:10.280 --> 2:48:14.320]  world government with a world ID pass a world health pass run by a microchip
[2:48:14.320 --> 2:48:18.160]  under your skin and that videos on info wars.com that's the guy running the
[2:48:18.160 --> 2:48:22.640]  whole show is that not incredible it is very incredible especially when you
[2:48:22.640 --> 2:48:27.080]  read the word I mean that's why I think Christ comes back as did we lose it's
[2:48:27.080 --> 2:48:32.320]  uh you know the flood was caused to wipe out the niflium and now we're doing the
[2:48:32.320 --> 2:48:38.920]  transgender thing we're trying to change humanity we're doing it again as it was
[2:48:38.920 --> 2:48:45.520]  in the days of Noah so will it be in the days of the Son of Man and it says you
[2:48:45.520 --> 2:48:49.200]  know if you try to save your life you will lose it if you lose you know lose
[2:48:49.200 --> 2:48:53.280]  your life we'll save it I'm not sure if that's not talking about that's right
[2:48:53.280 --> 2:48:57.400]  and now they're talking about quote oh lesbians and homosexuals don't want to
[2:48:57.400 --> 2:49:01.040]  have to go out and get a surrogate they're gonna splice two men and splice two
[2:49:01.040 --> 2:49:06.880]  women if that isn't the Son of Man that's not gonna be a person exactly you're
[2:49:06.880 --> 2:49:10.560]  you're not a human anymore that's why it says you you know you can't if you take
[2:49:10.560 --> 2:49:16.880]  the mark you will not be redeemed you can't be it's a genetic mark on and

[2:52:49.280 --> 2:52:54.520]  and it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say I don't know what's
[2:52:54.520 --> 2:53:00.880]  gonna happen at the end of this but you want to fight you better believe you got one
[2:53:00.880 --> 2:53:08.360]  from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[2:53:24.160 --> 2:53:28.960]  a lot of folks like to dress up in leather outfits and ride around on their
[2:53:28.960 --> 2:53:32.920]  motorcycles and tell everybody how they're big outlaws a lot of guys like
[2:53:32.920 --> 2:53:36.240]  to get into jiu-jitsu and you know getting great shape and learn how to
[2:53:36.240 --> 2:53:40.240]  fight really well and that's great I think that's fine in fact I like all
[2:53:40.240 --> 2:53:45.160]  that because we need to be extremely male in a society trying to tell us to
[2:53:45.160 --> 2:53:51.160]  be little passive slaves of the system but I really like to see all the tough
[2:53:51.160 --> 2:53:56.440]  guy men out there spend a little less time hanging out with other dudes acting
[2:53:56.440 --> 2:54:01.840]  tough and a little more time being politically engaged now I know when you
[2:54:01.840 --> 2:54:06.240]  do that you get put in prison like the proud boys or you get attacked like
[2:54:06.240 --> 2:54:12.760]  info wars but I really need all those tough guys to get engaged and I know
[2:54:12.760 --> 2:54:16.120]  rolling thunders a lot of great veterans and patriots but like their fun
[2:54:16.120 --> 2:54:19.760]  motorcycles motorcycles are awesome Pentagon said you're not welcome here
[2:54:19.760 --> 2:54:23.720]  rolling thunder this year that's because our country's been taken over by the
[2:54:23.720 --> 2:54:28.640]  chai comms and the globalist and it really is happening and they really
[2:54:28.640 --> 2:54:33.000]  already stabilizing the country and they're going to mask the coming
[2:54:33.000 --> 2:54:39.120]  economic collapse that's already begun with racial riots this summer that are
[2:54:39.120 --> 2:54:44.480]  gonna really make even the burning down of Detroit and other cities in the 1960s
[2:54:44.480 --> 2:54:48.640]  pale insignificance I don't think it's right for my people to act the way that
[2:54:48.640 --> 2:54:54.200]  they act this is all I can say about the thing because we're fighting one war
[2:54:54.200 --> 2:54:59.240]  now in Vietnam we were losing as it is so I mean why should we come back in
[2:54:59.240 --> 2:55:04.520]  fight a war among them I mean among ourselves as we speak of the puppet
[2:55:04.520 --> 2:55:09.480]  president of the O'Harris administration it really is Obama and then then their
[2:55:09.480 --> 2:55:13.040]  their puppet Harris Biden just came we don't have a teleprompter most of the time
[2:55:13.040 --> 2:55:16.960]  now unless he's carefully hopped up on it that means in the morning and he's
[2:55:16.960 --> 2:55:21.160]  saying oh I didn't think we turned things around from COVID and the economy
[2:55:21.160 --> 2:55:25.360]  right away that's why we need more stimulus and since I've been here the
[2:55:25.360 --> 2:55:31.760]  economy is at it five hundred thousand jobs per month this is progress and it's
[2:55:31.760 --> 2:55:35.520]  a testament to our new strategy of a growing this economy from the bottom up
[2:55:35.520 --> 2:55:40.320]  in the middle out the White House went on the defensive yesterday after the
[2:55:40.320 --> 2:55:44.120]  lowest monthly jobs report since President Biden took office we knew
[2:55:44.120 --> 2:55:48.760]  this wouldn't be a sprint it'd be a marathon employers added just two
[2:55:48.760 --> 2:55:52.760]  hundred and sixty six thousand jobs in April dramatically less than the
[2:55:52.760 --> 2:55:56.680]  million most economists had projected like as soon as I heard he was given a
[2:55:56.680 --> 2:55:59.800]  speech 10 minutes ago I said let me guess in a transcript they'll say the
[2:55:59.800 --> 2:56:03.480]  answer is more stimulus although that's why people won't go to work because
[2:56:03.480 --> 2:56:07.600]  they're getting a check they go buy things and then that makes prices go up
[2:56:07.600 --> 2:56:14.680]  and scarce commodities because no one is growing the crops or delivering the
[2:56:14.680 --> 2:56:19.480]  cattle to slaughter or building the microchips or cutting down the timber or
[2:56:19.480 --> 2:56:24.080]  growing the corn or smelting the steel that's why steel tripled in prices
[2:56:24.080 --> 2:56:27.960]  last few months that's why corn's up 80% in the last few months set to triple
[2:56:27.960 --> 2:56:32.200]  that's why food prices are set to be up 76% by the end of summer current
[2:56:32.200 --> 2:56:36.040]  purchases around the world of crops going in there's such a scarcity people are
[2:56:36.040 --> 2:56:39.920]  buying the crops before they're even planted I've got all that data here I
[2:56:39.920 --> 2:56:44.400]  told you last year when the first world collapses the third world dies then the
[2:56:44.400 --> 2:56:48.320]  UN will organize that giant third world collapse to break our borders to flood
[2:56:48.320 --> 2:56:52.280]  us and they'll have a giant underclass permanently controlled and that's in the
[2:56:52.280 --> 2:56:57.720]  globalist documents we were already calculating 135 million people around
[2:56:57.720 --> 2:57:01.920]  the world before COVID marching to the break of starvation and now with the
[2:57:01.920 --> 2:57:07.080]  new analysis with COVID we're looking at 260 million people and I'm not talking
[2:57:07.080 --> 2:57:11.920]  about hungry I'm talking about marching towards starvation they create
[2:57:11.920 --> 2:57:16.800]  crises offer a solution that creates a bigger crises that gives them more power
[2:57:16.800 --> 2:57:25.000]  and they repeat it over and over and over and over again all right ladies and
[2:57:25.000 --> 2:57:28.400]  gentlemen we're gonna go to break here in about 20 seconds we're gonna come back
[2:57:28.400 --> 2:57:32.080]  with our special guest Drew Mason and he's a really smart guy you probably see
[2:57:32.080 --> 2:57:35.120]  him on Fox News Fox business other channels we're really excited that
[2:57:35.120 --> 2:57:37.480]  when I started talking to him about being a guest he said how about I just fly
[2:57:37.480 --> 2:57:40.960]  down so he's in studio with us on the other side we'll be back in 60 seconds
[2:57:40.960 --> 2:57:43.320]  stay with us
[2:57:43.760 --> 2:57:48.320]  listeners have rightfully been complaining the last six months or so
[2:57:48.320 --> 2:57:53.200]  saying where are most of the best-selling products you have that we love and my
[2:57:53.200 --> 2:57:57.600]  answer is the supply chain has broken down I have to either reformulate or I
[2:57:57.600 --> 2:58:01.040]  have to lower the quality to get a lot of these and so that's why we don't have
[2:58:01.040 --> 2:58:04.680]  a lot of products in that's why info wars is in financial trouble is because if
[2:58:04.680 --> 2:58:08.120]  we had the product you would be buying it we have the money but so many of them
[2:58:08.120 --> 2:58:11.640]  have been sold out just like you notice a lot of other items at the store aren't
[2:58:11.640 --> 2:58:16.960]  available because civilization is being artificially imploded but finally x2 is

[3:00:31.320 --> 3:00:36.480]  return of inflation and you can see that bios been out for a few years he's been
[3:00:36.480 --> 3:00:41.400]  warning of this for a long time now that inflation it looks like we know has
[3:00:41.400 --> 3:00:45.000]  reared it's ugly head and he's here with us for the balance the hour great to
[3:00:45.000 --> 3:00:50.640]  have you here sir thank you Alex praise be Jesus for all our blessings thank you
[3:00:50.640 --> 3:00:53.520]  for having me it's good to have you here wow well I mean you're an expert on the
[3:00:53.520 --> 3:00:57.240]  markets you made a lot of accurate predictions what's going on right now I
[3:00:57.240 --> 3:01:03.760]  think Alex the dominant influence in the markets today is government money
[3:01:03.760 --> 3:01:07.920]  printing traditionally if you look at how you value equities in the markets
[3:01:07.920 --> 3:01:12.960]  there isn't a component for government input but today that is what is
[3:01:12.960 --> 3:01:17.200]  dominating the pricing so if you ask yourself just step back it's very simple
[3:01:17.200 --> 3:01:22.840]  why do you think the Fed is printing the money why are they doing QE and the
[3:01:22.840 --> 3:01:28.720]  reason is simply that they don't want the markets meaning stocks bonds real
[3:01:28.720 --> 3:01:34.840]  estate to trade where those markets would naturally trade and free markets so
[3:01:34.840 --> 3:01:40.200]  QE is artificial sustenance that is artificially elevating these markets and
[3:01:40.200 --> 3:01:43.760]  in the short term we all feel good about it because you look in your statement
[3:01:43.760 --> 3:01:47.160]  and you see it moving higher but is pushing it further and further from
[3:01:47.160 --> 3:01:54.200]  natural equilibrium so when that happens I think it's very prudent for
[3:01:54.200 --> 3:01:59.760]  investors to say this is unsustainable over the long term shouldn't I have some
[3:01:59.760 --> 3:02:05.400]  of my assets allocated in a way that is actually artificially cheap because of
[3:02:05.400 --> 3:02:10.680]  the way the Fed is manipulating these markets with its investments and that
[3:02:10.680 --> 3:02:15.920]  has led us to gold and silver and we believe they are extremely attractive at
[3:02:15.920 --> 3:02:19.880]  this point in time when sentiment is about as bad as it's ever been in the
[3:02:19.880 --> 3:02:23.960]  metals and we think the future looks very good Alex well I'll tell the
[3:02:23.960 --> 3:02:29.880]  listeners straight up I've not promoted or sold gold in about eight years because
[3:02:29.880 --> 3:02:32.960]  I saw them artificially manipulating the markets and I told listeners I if you're
[3:02:32.960 --> 3:02:36.440]  not going to stand it for a long haul then I would get out of it but I said I
[3:02:36.440 --> 3:02:40.160]  think in five ten years will probably go right back up but for now I'm telling
[3:02:40.160 --> 3:02:42.880]  listeners about two years ago I would get back in the gold silver you've seen it
[3:02:42.880 --> 3:02:48.400]  explode but I haven't gone out and gotten a gold or silver partner because I don't
[3:02:48.400 --> 3:02:52.080]  want to say most of them are disreputable but they still charge too much and they
[3:02:52.080 --> 3:02:56.200]  just don't have really good word of mouth we actually sought you out you
[3:02:56.200 --> 3:02:59.160]  didn't seek us out turns out you are a listener because I was aware that you
[3:02:59.160 --> 3:03:02.720]  have a really good name you have really good stats on people liking you and I
[3:03:02.720 --> 3:03:06.440]  have people inside the office that buy from you and and and whose families do
[3:03:06.440 --> 3:03:09.360]  and say they've had a great response to them when you said hell I'll just come
[3:03:09.360 --> 3:03:13.480]  down there I was really excited to have you come down and you just wanted to
[3:03:13.480 --> 3:03:16.800]  really get on and talk about Christ and fasting and the fight against the devil
[3:03:16.800 --> 3:03:19.840]  but which is you know the key to everything but I also want to twist
[3:03:19.840 --> 3:03:24.360]  your arm and you'll get you on board as a sponsor but also tell folks now is the
[3:03:24.360 --> 3:03:27.040]  time obviously to get into gold and silver and I think you're the place you
[3:03:27.040 --> 3:03:31.960]  go well thank you so much I'll give you a few stats that may be of interest to
[3:03:31.960 --> 3:03:38.480]  listeners so in 1971 when they first deregulated gold the ratio of the S&P to
[3:03:38.480 --> 3:03:44.840]  gold was 2.3 times this month we are right back at that level what ensued was
[3:03:44.840 --> 3:03:50.760]  a gold exploded plus 20x in the decade that followed while the equity market
[3:03:50.760 --> 3:03:54.920]  multiple was cut in half now this is not to say that that's absolutely going to
[3:03:54.920 --> 3:03:59.920]  happen again but I believe investing I think it's pretty clear is about
[3:03:59.920 --> 3:04:05.800]  probabilities and when you see past bands of resistance and support whether
[3:04:05.800 --> 3:04:08.960]  it's from evaluation perspective a technical perspective it warrants
[3:04:08.960 --> 3:04:14.560]  attention and so we're there if you think also about the fact that right now
[3:04:14.560 --> 3:04:21.440]  we have 80% almost 80% of all of the dollars in the world today have been
[3:04:21.440 --> 3:04:26.360]  created in the last 18 months so think about that we're a nation that's over
[3:04:26.360 --> 3:04:31.800]  200 years old but 80% of dollars have been flooded into the market with the
[3:04:31.800 --> 3:04:37.240]  recent money printing you know that when you have something like that occur it's
[3:04:37.240 --> 3:04:42.560]  only a question of time before the market prices in the reality that these
[3:04:42.560 --> 3:04:46.520]  paper dollars backed by nothing you're going to need more of them to buy a
[3:04:46.520 --> 3:04:53.080]  physical asset that's a very positive development for gold if you look at the
[3:04:53.080 --> 3:04:58.560]  incredible influx of new investors into the equity markets the euphoria you see
[3:04:58.560 --> 3:05:04.000]  the ascent of debt margin debt at a rate that has been problematic in the past
[3:05:04.000 --> 3:05:09.360]  consumer confidence there are many things that are saying it's time to have
[3:05:09.360 --> 3:05:13.920]  at least some of your portfolio allocated in a cautious way the mentality of
[3:05:13.920 --> 3:05:16.880]  some people who have never made money is I'm just going to throw everything in and
[3:05:16.880 --> 3:05:22.400]  be aggressive but for those people who have spent a lifetime working I wouldn't
[3:05:22.400 --> 3:05:26.160]  say to you you need to go and sell anything and just need to go and sell
[3:05:26.160 --> 3:05:31.480]  everything however at this juncture with the historical precedence that we have
[3:05:31.480 --> 3:05:37.680]  it is so prudent to take some of your wealth and position it in an asset that
[3:05:37.680 --> 3:05:42.920]  has thrived in the past when we've seen stress in the markets we discussed
[3:05:42.920 --> 3:05:46.920]  exactly and I could have had 20 gold sponsors and we went out and checked
[3:05:46.920 --> 3:05:50.800]  out some and they just weren't to the standards of the previous gold sponsor we
[3:05:50.800 --> 3:05:55.480]  had that then because of you know issues and family things basically retired and
[3:05:55.480 --> 3:05:58.480]  stopped selling gold so I'm glad to have you here I know you didn't really want
[3:05:58.480 --> 3:06:02.200]  to even pitch gold people today but I think people should check out what you're
[3:06:02.200 --> 3:06:06.800]  doing they should go there you know your fine organization st joseph partners
[3:06:06.800 --> 3:06:11.480]  com sd joseph partners com people want to support info wars and have a
[3:06:11.480 --> 3:06:15.560]  percentage of that you know a small markup it's there so they can operate go
[3:06:15.560 --> 3:06:18.680]  to info wars keep us on air it's the full spectrum of the very same deals it's
[3:06:18.680 --> 3:06:23.720]  info wars gold calm and then that way we get a small commission to help funder
[3:06:23.720 --> 3:06:28.320]  operation info wars gold calm and I can tell you I personally am going to be
[3:06:28.320 --> 3:06:33.440]  buying a bunch of gold and silver from this gentleman I'm gonna take the money
[3:06:33.440 --> 3:06:36.920]  he gives us from sales and fund the operation but then any money that I
[3:06:36.920 --> 3:06:40.600]  have set aside that comes from that I'm gonna buy some more gold and silver
[3:06:40.600 --> 3:06:44.600]  because my ex-wife divorced me seven eight years ago and in the divorce she
[3:06:44.600 --> 3:06:49.360]  got all the gold and silver that I should say I bought on average for about $400
[3:06:49.360 --> 3:06:53.360]  divorce happened when gold was the right at about 2,000 you can imagine that was
[3:06:53.360 --> 3:06:57.880]  a good investment for me with that gold and silver and that was about half my
[3:06:57.880 --> 3:07:01.480]  savings wasn't gold and silver in a safety deposit box it was still wasn't a
[3:07:01.480 --> 3:07:05.800]  huge sum but it was quite a bit and it tripled in price I always go with gut
[3:07:05.800 --> 3:07:09.440]  level and just looking at the markets and everything and everything tells me get
[3:07:09.440 --> 3:07:12.680]  into gold and silver now I've been saying it for again two plus years and
[3:07:12.680 --> 3:07:16.160]  we've seen how much it's gone up so we need to really kind of a no-brainer if
[3:07:16.160 --> 3:07:19.920]  there's global inflation and all this devaluing of currencies going on well
[3:07:19.920 --> 3:07:25.040]  gold and silver isn't just a commodity I mean it's a it's a historical sign of
[3:07:25.040 --> 3:07:29.160]  wealth a symbol of wealth and it's used industrially correct it is you know
[3:07:29.160 --> 3:07:33.360]  you're absolutely right and you bring up a great point Alex for some people who
[3:07:33.360 --> 3:07:38.720]  may be new to it they may think gold it's complicated gold is extremely simple
[3:07:38.720 --> 3:07:44.040]  what is gold it's money it's a currency that a central banker can't mess up with
[3:07:44.040 --> 3:07:47.640]  a policy error now some people will say well hey I can't take gold into the
[3:07:47.640 --> 3:07:50.480]  supermarket so that means it's not a currency but that's not true you can't
[3:07:50.480 --> 3:07:55.720]  take a Japanese yen or a euro into the supermarkets because they won't accept
[3:07:55.720 --> 3:08:00.920]  that money has two functions one is to make it easy to live with day-to-day
[3:08:00.920 --> 3:08:06.000]  transactions and for that unquestionably the dollar is the best but the second of
[3:08:06.000 --> 3:08:10.680]  two functions that money should play in your portfolio is that it should be a
[3:08:10.680 --> 3:08:16.160]  store of wealth and in our lifetimes we've seen the value of dollars lose
[3:08:16.160 --> 3:08:21.160]  over 70% of their purchasing power meanwhile gold is up more than 20x and
[3:08:21.160 --> 3:08:25.120]  his saw and this isn't something that we had to try and figure out for the first
[3:08:25.120 --> 3:08:30.120]  time in our minds it's not this lab experiment that has an unknown ending the
[3:08:30.120 --> 3:08:35.320]  beautiful thing about gold is that we have literally hundreds of examples that
[3:08:35.320 --> 3:08:39.800]  we can look at through his say there say there it's a known quantity it's a
[3:08:39.800 --> 3:08:44.920]  safe haven we'll be right back stay with us I am a very humble person but I'm
[3:08:44.920 --> 3:08:48.880]  also a bold person and so as bad as things are with the globalist attack
[3:08:48.880 --> 3:08:52.960]  humanity of all the terrible things that are unfolding I want you to know a lot
[3:08:52.960 --> 3:08:58.560]  of positive things are happening as well I'm a public figure so I get to see things
[3:08:58.560 --> 3:09:02.200]  zero public doesn't get to see and let me tell you whether it's police chiefs or
[3:09:02.200 --> 3:09:07.120]  members of Congress or even folks in Hollywood or mainstream media or
[3:09:07.120 --> 3:09:12.480]  industry people are really really away from the establishment they don't want
[3:09:12.480 --> 3:09:16.240]  to go on with the globalist but they're scared they're looking for leadership
[3:09:16.240 --> 3:09:21.400]  well that's where in force comes in you fund us you support in force or com you
[3:09:21.400 --> 3:09:25.920]  get ready to the same time we will then go out and do what the globalist says
[3:09:25.920 --> 3:09:30.640]  unpopular but the globalist will target you for to show people that it's safe to
[3:09:30.640 --> 3:09:35.600]  tell the truth and to take the heat that's our job so please keep us on the
[3:09:35.600 --> 3:09:39.520]  air so we can hit the bar wire so we can be the shock groups and the
[3:09:39.520 --> 3:09:43.960]  information war fund us at info or store.com the best product I'm not
[3:09:43.960 --> 3:09:46.480]  supposed to be biased but I'm gonna tell you all now if you haven't tried
[3:09:46.480 --> 3:09:50.080]  turbo force you need to try it I've tried turbo force with everything
[3:09:50.080 --> 3:09:54.280]  sometimes you know I went a little bit crazy I put turbo force in my coffee
[3:09:54.280 --> 3:09:57.840]  that was a crazy week I don't remember sleeping but as far as the products go
[3:09:57.840 --> 3:10:01.240]  turbo force is my favorite and all the info wars products were down to take
[3:10:01.240 --> 3:10:05.200]  control your life take control your health not relying on other people to do
[3:10:05.200 --> 3:10:10.800]  it for you nobody wakes up in the morning and thinks I'm gonna give that
[3:10:10.800 --> 3:10:13.800]  person over there a better life I'm gonna wake up today you know I'm gonna
[3:10:13.800 --> 3:10:17.480]  spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier happier and
[3:10:17.480 --> 3:10:20.480]  richer I'm gonna make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend I don't think
[3:10:20.480 --> 3:10:23.000]  that happens very often it's never happened to me I've never had anyone
[3:10:23.000 --> 3:10:26.080]  knock on my door and said Tate you're such a good guy how can I improve your
[3:10:26.080 --> 3:10:29.240]  life in every single way there's only one person who woke up in fault man and
[3:10:29.240 --> 3:10:32.520]  that was me I woke up and thought you know what okay I want to take control of
[3:10:32.520 --> 3:10:34.640]  my life I want to take control of my health and that's why you need to go
[3:10:34.640 --> 3:10:37.080]  to info wars calm take control of your health right now and support the
[3:10:37.080 --> 3:10:40.360]  resistance don't buy into the group think don't drink the Kool-Aid drink the
[3:10:40.360 --> 3:10:44.520]  turbo force Kool-Aid's bad the turbo force is good
[3:10:44.520 --> 3:11:00.760]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:11:02.400 --> 3:11:06.400]  welcome back the Alex Jones show you know sometimes I make mistakes but over
[3:11:06.400 --> 3:11:10.680]  the years I've gotten pretty accurate about that enough it's over time but I
[3:11:10.680 --> 3:11:17.880]  only promote things that I know are the very best bet for me personally and then
[3:11:17.880 --> 3:11:22.880]  whatever I am personally doing in my life that I've seen me successful I
[3:11:22.880 --> 3:11:28.360]  encourage others to do well I basically have very little gold and very little
[3:11:28.360 --> 3:11:33.360]  silver because again that was you know taken when my ex-wife divorced me
[3:11:33.360 --> 3:11:37.000]  starting seven and a half eight years ago and that's fine because I don't care
[3:11:37.000 --> 3:11:41.960]  about possessions I told the story though you know to explain that I bought
[3:11:41.960 --> 3:11:47.520]  most that gold at 350 400 maybe 500 and then as the market went up it was too
[3:11:47.520 --> 3:11:52.200]  rich for me but but now there's really no choice because the dollars so devalued
[3:11:52.200 --> 3:11:55.560]  and the inflation is coming around the world that it's a no-brainer for me so
[3:11:55.560 --> 3:11:59.200]  I really think listeners should get into gold they should get into silver and
[3:11:59.200 --> 3:12:03.640]  they should do it now but you were telling me Drew Mason that you were
[3:12:03.640 --> 3:12:09.560]  seeing in your highly respected company dwindling supplies because I was you
[3:12:09.560 --> 3:12:13.040]  know asking you about supply they're in the break that's another sign that
[3:12:13.040 --> 3:12:17.240]  people in my view should not wait to get into gold and silver for me it's a no
[3:12:17.240 --> 3:12:24.480]  brainer you're absolutely right Alex so the quantity of different types of coins
[3:12:24.480 --> 3:12:29.560]  and metals that we have has been reduced the men's are having trouble keeping up
[3:12:29.560 --> 3:12:33.600]  with demand whether in particular if you look at say the US Mint Royal Canadian
[3:12:33.600 --> 3:12:39.080]  Mint and there's a few things that we would highlight for investors about
[3:12:39.080 --> 3:12:43.880]  this Alex and I were also talking more about the market something investors
[3:12:43.880 --> 3:12:49.600]  should be aware right now the equity markets in the US are at evaluation
[3:12:49.600 --> 3:12:56.520]  that's 40 percent above the prior bubble in the dot-com era it's not to say it
[3:12:56.520 --> 3:13:01.680]  can't go higher but again as you think about how do you want to allocate 99% of
[3:13:01.680 --> 3:13:07.520]  Americans don't have any physical gold yet that is not a well-constructed
[3:13:07.520 --> 3:13:12.080]  portfolio I believe in this landscape that we have and don't we see University
[3:13:12.080 --> 3:13:15.840]  of Texas and the Chinese and all these other institutions are buying gold and
[3:13:15.840 --> 3:13:20.520]  silver up very fast Texas does have a physical allocation they have had it I'm
[3:13:20.520 --> 3:13:23.520]  not sure happens in the latest filing but they certainly did about about a
[3:13:23.520 --> 3:13:29.040]  billion dollars worth China has continued to import gold and clearly they
[3:13:29.040 --> 3:13:36.080]  have a slug of gold we talked about what is money in Chinese the word for money
[3:13:36.080 --> 3:13:40.880]  has two characters and gold is one of them where it is so rooted into the
[3:13:40.880 --> 3:13:46.880]  culture that's the same in Japan the Japanese culture it is a money and to
[3:13:46.880 --> 3:13:50.720]  those people they wouldn't think about not having something that would be
[3:13:50.720 --> 3:13:56.120]  protected from government policy errors especially in periods like today where
[3:13:56.120 --> 3:14:02.920]  we have such massive indebtedness Alex how would you recommend people start
[3:14:02.920 --> 3:14:07.600]  investing in gold or I mean can they just call you guys you can answer
[3:14:07.600 --> 3:14:12.360]  questions they go to info worth gold dot com what's the best way so again a
[3:14:12.360 --> 3:14:16.240]  beautiful thing about gold is that it's so simple it is just money that a
[3:14:16.240 --> 3:14:20.680]  government can't destroy and it appreciates on a relative basis as
[3:14:20.680 --> 3:14:24.120]  governments print more so Alex you brought up the great point you said that
[3:14:24.120 --> 3:14:30.320]  when you were buying gold it was in the $300 $300 now it's range so we get that
[3:14:30.320 --> 3:14:35.320]  question a lot people say well gold's at $1,800 now isn't it too late and what I
[3:14:35.320 --> 3:14:38.760]  think you want to consider you don't want to look at the price of gold in some
[3:14:38.760 --> 3:14:43.680]  static vacuum because yeah that's the valued dollars it's not that gold went
[3:14:43.680 --> 3:14:47.520]  up it's that the dollars less worth absolutely or worth less absolutely and
[3:14:47.520 --> 3:14:52.560]  you can see that the quantity of dollars again has exploded so really even
[3:14:52.560 --> 3:14:57.200]  though gold is up relative to where it was in terms of dollars 20 years ago
[3:14:57.200 --> 3:15:02.400]  that pace still hasn't kept up with the with just a torrid pace of dollar
[3:15:02.400 --> 3:15:05.240]  creation well that's exactly it for two years I've been trying to get a good
[3:15:05.240 --> 3:15:09.280]  gold sponsor and I could get 20 of them they're just not as good as you some are
[3:15:09.280 --> 3:15:12.200]  actually pretty good but you're even better with your background and everything
[3:15:12.200 --> 3:15:18.560]  and I was just literally talking to my family and I said it's property that
[3:15:18.560 --> 3:15:23.080]  can grow crops and it's gold and silver and it's it's friends and family you
[3:15:23.080 --> 3:15:26.240]  can trust to take care of yourselves during a depression because I think
[3:15:26.240 --> 3:15:31.520]  we're moving into a zone where it's more probable we're gonna have civil
[3:15:31.520 --> 3:15:36.040]  unrest and and depression versus the alternative of prosperity I mean I
[3:15:36.040 --> 3:15:39.600]  really think America and the world's going under some type of judgment and
[3:15:39.600 --> 3:15:44.720]  Alex I want to say something based on your comments to listeners what we're
[3:15:44.720 --> 3:15:47.680]  going through this isn't the first time this has happened again it's been
[3:15:47.680 --> 3:15:52.720]  repeated again and again my favorite financial book was called is called when
[3:15:52.720 --> 3:15:57.240]  money dies and it's the story of what happened in Europe when there were so
[3:15:57.240 --> 3:16:01.960]  many things unfolding that were similar to today and what you saw was that
[3:16:01.960 --> 3:16:07.840]  people who shifted a portion of their wealth into gold as there became less
[3:16:07.840 --> 3:16:12.040]  confidence in those paper currencies that gold and silver that they had
[3:16:12.040 --> 3:16:16.120]  allocated to then allowed them to have more wealth and more influence in the
[3:16:16.120 --> 3:16:19.960]  new paradigm let me give you another example that I think is striking
[3:16:19.960 --> 3:16:25.040]  obviously the most famous name in American finance is JP Morgan the man
[3:16:25.040 --> 3:16:30.640]  well in the 1920s again it was a period similar to today you had the stock
[3:16:30.640 --> 3:16:37.520]  market roaring but you had debts exploding and Morgan concluded it wasn't
[3:16:37.520 --> 3:16:42.640]  prudent to be a hundred percent all into the equity markets so he maintained a
[3:16:42.640 --> 3:16:48.160]  portion of his wealth that he could exchange into physical gold so late
[3:16:48.160 --> 3:16:53.400]  20s meaning like 27 28 people said oh you're dumb you're missing out on the
[3:16:53.400 --> 3:16:58.880]  upside in the stock market here 29 came around early in the year people said the
[3:16:58.880 --> 3:17:05.080]  same thing and the crash ensued as the depression matured a very famous
[3:17:05.080 --> 3:17:08.280]  institution was up against the ropes you know what that institution was Alex
[3:17:08.280 --> 3:17:13.640]  my chance it was the US government and they came to Morgan and they said we'd
[3:17:13.640 --> 3:17:19.440]  like to borrow your gold and he agreed but he clearly cut the deals of a
[3:17:19.440 --> 3:17:24.000]  lifetime when he did that and that is an example that we've seen again and again
[3:17:24.000 --> 3:17:29.200]  so by having he who has the gold makes the rule that there's a reason why that's
[3:17:29.200 --> 3:17:35.120]  saying has lasted for centuries so looking at this history does repeat it
[3:17:35.120 --> 3:17:38.840]  does rhyme we're in the 20s again we're seeing record hyperinflation like
[3:17:38.840 --> 3:17:42.400]  Germany and and other countries had and so it looks like it is going to repeat
[3:17:42.400 --> 3:17:47.240]  itself but maybe sooner than 1929 can you see this bubble going for another eight
[3:17:47.240 --> 3:17:51.920]  years well let's I think we would both agree as Americans we would like to but
[3:17:51.920 --> 3:17:58.040]  I would love to see the Fed be able to architect in the next 10 years what it
[3:17:58.040 --> 3:18:03.160]  did in the last 10 higher stock markets higher real estate better bonds strong
[3:18:03.160 --> 3:18:08.920]  economy I'm rooting for them I would love to see it happen I hope it does but
[3:18:08.920 --> 3:18:15.720]  you don't build your wealth strategy just on hope you want to have something in
[3:18:15.720 --> 3:18:22.000]  place for if the unexpected occur let's expand on that this is like having a
[3:18:22.000 --> 3:18:25.480]  life jacket going on a ship in the middle of a typhoon or hurricane I mean
[3:18:25.480 --> 3:18:28.880]  it's not like you just might need it looks like you're gonna need it and if
[3:18:28.880 --> 3:18:31.960]  you look at what the global through saying they want yearly shutdowns for
[3:18:31.960 --> 3:18:35.800]  carbon but really that's to create artificial depression just to train us
[3:18:35.800 --> 3:18:38.920]  to accept depression they're already getting everybody ready for civil and
[3:18:38.920 --> 3:18:41.880]  rest and collapse I think they're worried that they can't even hold it off a
[3:18:41.880 --> 3:18:48.520]  year you could be right I I have to say Alex I've been surprised that the
[3:18:48.520 --> 3:18:52.280]  markets have been as strong as they have with everything that's going on if you
[3:18:52.280 --> 3:18:55.400]  would hand me the headlines 10 years ago I would have said there's no way gold
[3:18:55.400 --> 3:19:00.680]  would be this cheap equities would be this expensive but they are so I don't
[3:19:00.680 --> 3:19:06.200]  have the conviction to say exactly when this is going to happen but I think we
[3:19:06.200 --> 3:19:11.600]  clearly have a monster then let me rephrase it a generational tailwind
[3:19:11.600 --> 3:19:17.480]  forming behind gold at this point in time with so many different things coming
[3:19:17.480 --> 3:19:21.600]  together well sure I mean in a basket of diversifying and not having everything
[3:19:21.600 --> 3:19:25.160]  in one basket gold is an O-brainer all you need some good place to get the gold
[3:19:25.160 --> 3:19:29.600]  that's info worth gold.com st. Joseph partners but info worth gold.com it's

[3:24:31.040 --> 3:24:35.280]  host Alex Jones St. Joseph partners.com you've seen him on Fox Business you've
[3:24:35.280 --> 3:24:39.440]  seen him in Forbes you've seen him on Fox all over the place and I've been
[3:24:39.440 --> 3:24:43.240]  looking around for reputable gold sponsor they're either afraid of the big
[3:24:43.240 --> 3:24:47.080]  bad evil Alex Jones no one work with us or they're not giving people really good
[3:24:47.080 --> 3:24:50.320]  deals and so I was talking to our guest here and I said the interviews going
[3:24:50.320 --> 3:24:54.280]  great you know you wanted to get into fasting and the fight between good and
[3:24:54.280 --> 3:24:58.440]  evil and he said yeah but you asked me three questions but then I ran over me
[3:24:58.440 --> 3:25:01.680]  didn't let him answer those three questions so get into those three
[3:25:01.680 --> 3:25:04.800]  questions because those those are questions I have okay one of the things
[3:25:04.800 --> 3:25:08.440]  Alex you said was how should people buy it my suggestion to you would be to buy
[3:25:08.440 --> 3:25:14.320]  small-form gold preferably coins that are minted by a sovereign meant meaning
[3:25:14.320 --> 3:25:18.120]  they're so easily recognizable a beautiful thing about gold is it when it
[3:25:18.120 --> 3:25:21.720]  comes from a mint like that it's so easily proven to be real that means when
[3:25:21.720 --> 3:25:26.840]  you go to sell it you'll have liquidity people will recognize it's real you
[3:25:26.840 --> 3:25:32.280]  won't have any friction as you would with a bigger bar the second thing Alex I
[3:25:32.280 --> 3:25:35.920]  had talked about was an allocation some of the smartest people in finance say
[3:25:35.920 --> 3:25:41.240]  you want a 5 to 10 percent allocation personally I don't see how in this
[3:25:41.240 --> 3:25:45.560]  environment you don't want at least a 10 percent allocation but I'd say to you
[3:25:45.560 --> 3:25:50.800]  the key thing is to just get a toe in the water get some see how it works take
[3:25:50.800 --> 3:25:54.880]  it down get comfortable with the space requirements you know if you're going to
[3:25:54.880 --> 3:26:00.240]  store it in insured storage but just get some and you can work your way to what
[3:26:00.240 --> 3:26:04.480]  you conclude for your situation is the best allocation I'm buying some today
[3:26:04.480 --> 3:26:11.160]  no seriously the third thing Alex had brought up was the returns of gold and I
[3:26:11.160 --> 3:26:19.480]  wanted to dispel something that has been that has really mischaracterized gold so
[3:26:19.480 --> 3:26:23.520]  we buy gold for defense meaning for wealth protection however you have
[3:26:23.520 --> 3:26:27.200]  nothing to be embarrassed about in terms of the returns a lot of the
[3:26:27.200 --> 3:26:33.440]  misinformation that was out there and a lot of the confusion about it came to
[3:26:33.440 --> 3:26:38.600]  do with some tombs that looked at the price tombs meaning thick books that
[3:26:38.600 --> 3:26:42.800]  looked at the price of gold and its performance versus equities over time
[3:26:42.800 --> 3:26:46.960]  one that had tremendous adoption of Wall Street was called stocks from the
[3:26:46.960 --> 3:26:51.920]  long stocks for the long run and at the end of this tomb they showed it sharp
[3:26:51.920 --> 3:26:56.520]  and they showed the returns of equities which they characterized as us equities
[3:26:56.520 --> 3:27:01.720]  versus gold and they looked at this period from the 1800s up to the up to
[3:27:01.720 --> 3:27:08.520]  the 2000s and the conclusion was stocks about perform gold by a hundred thousand
[3:27:08.520 --> 3:27:13.400]  percent so financial advisors looked at that and they say why would I ever want
[3:27:13.400 --> 3:27:19.920]  to allocate a penny to gold but what was so disingenuous about that study was
[3:27:19.920 --> 3:27:27.360]  that for 75% that study the price of gold was fixed it wasn't allowed to trade
[3:27:27.360 --> 3:27:33.800]  freely with the US market so you know that that is not fair how wouldn't it
[3:27:33.800 --> 3:27:39.680]  be a whole lot wiser to say well how has gold performed versus equities when
[3:27:39.680 --> 3:27:43.400]  both have been allowed to trade freely because we now have 50 years as of this
[3:27:43.400 --> 3:27:48.320]  summer of data on that point gold is clearly a more defensible assets you
[3:27:48.320 --> 3:27:52.840]  would expect it to perform worse right well the reality is gold has slightly
[3:27:52.840 --> 3:27:58.000]  outperformed stocks as of the end of 2020 in the period of time since it's been
[3:27:58.000 --> 3:28:01.600]  allowed to trade freely the south perform stocks and one in three years as
[3:28:01.600 --> 3:28:05.440]  well that's not to say it's always going to but we're now for me we're now in the
[3:28:05.440 --> 3:28:08.320]  endgame where they're getting ready to just say all these currencies of
[3:28:08.320 --> 3:28:12.720]  collapse bring out a new global currency and so I mean at a gut level for me it
[3:28:12.720 --> 3:28:19.200]  means get into gold and silver because we're in such an inflationary bubble
[3:28:19.200 --> 3:28:22.880]  market that we're seeing an acceleration of the evaluation of currencies
[3:28:22.880 --> 3:28:26.360]  that's why you see the stock market going up because it's representing that
[3:28:26.360 --> 3:28:31.360]  the devaluation you're right Alex and I'm trying to approach it from the
[3:28:31.360 --> 3:28:34.480]  listener's perspective anticipating the pushback they're going to have and
[3:28:34.480 --> 3:28:39.040]  trying to reason through with them why this this argument to have some really
[3:28:39.040 --> 3:28:43.440]  makes complete sense the last point I wanted to make from our prior conversation
[3:28:43.440 --> 3:28:48.920]  I didn't complete was the benefit that gold brings to a portfolio so if you
[3:28:48.920 --> 3:28:53.680]  look at the returns and what's called the correlations that means does an asset
[3:28:53.680 --> 3:28:57.800]  move in tandem or does it move in more of an opposite direction with other
[3:28:57.800 --> 3:29:02.920]  assets in your portfolio rule number one for your portfolio construction should
[3:29:02.920 --> 3:29:07.280]  be you want to have some asset in your portfolio that does well when the others
[3:29:07.280 --> 3:29:11.280]  don't since gold has been allowed to trade freely it has what's called a
[3:29:11.280 --> 3:29:17.280]  negative correlation to real estate bonds and stocks that is a beautiful
[3:29:17.280 --> 3:29:21.360]  attribute for a portfolio it's a hedge it's a hedge it's a hedge and the data
[3:29:21.360 --> 3:29:26.040]  supports the notion isn't it pretty much the ultimate hedge other than knowledge
[3:29:26.040 --> 3:29:32.200]  you have in your brain you know you no matter how far you go back in time it has
[3:29:32.200 --> 3:29:36.080]  worked in preserving wealth it has sustained wars it has sustained
[3:29:36.080 --> 3:29:40.440]  insurrections it sustained foolish government policy when things collapse
[3:29:40.440 --> 3:29:45.000]  gold's king out of the whole pantheon of metals but here's why I have an issue
[3:29:45.000 --> 3:29:48.320]  where they can take your bank accounts now they're persecuting Christians and
[3:29:48.320 --> 3:29:52.680]  conservatives and nationalists and capitalists when they can do all this to me
[3:29:52.680 --> 3:29:56.880]  having something recognized around the world something that's portable
[3:29:56.880 --> 3:30:00.760]  something that's easy to hide that's the reason I'm getting back into gold and
[3:30:00.760 --> 3:30:05.800]  silver is is because of that I mean I mean to me that's the real reason just
[3:30:05.800 --> 3:30:09.360]  like pirates would bury their treasure I mean at the end of the day you can't
[3:30:09.360 --> 3:30:12.680]  trust any of this in this authoritarian climate other than something you can
[3:30:12.680 --> 3:30:17.520]  hide and that is one of the most enjoyable parts of my job is hearing
[3:30:17.520 --> 3:30:23.040]  stories from clients firsthand who got out of Europe where their goal was
[3:30:23.040 --> 3:30:29.440]  helpful to them who got out of Vietnam and American citizens who underestimated
[3:30:29.440 --> 3:30:34.000]  the debt that they had they had all their assets reconfiscated but they had a
[3:30:34.000 --> 3:30:41.440]  drawer full of coins and that allowed them to move on rebuild and and and rescue
[3:30:41.440 --> 3:30:44.880]  what otherwise would have been a very problematic situation for their family
[3:30:44.880 --> 3:30:47.560]  sure during the Great Depression where my grandparents told the story on both
[3:30:47.560 --> 3:30:50.840]  sides of the family nobody turned in the gold and the government said do it back
[3:30:50.840 --> 3:30:54.960]  then and then that kept them through the depression was that hidden you'll
[3:30:54.960 --> 3:30:59.440]  syrup bucket or you'll manage yard you'll bury the backyard with gold in it
[3:30:59.440 --> 3:31:04.000]  it was stories like that I heard firsthand from people of how valuable it
[3:31:04.000 --> 3:31:09.840]  was combined with the recognition that so few Americans have it that led me into
[3:31:09.840 --> 3:31:13.480]  gold as a career change when I left equities I left the street you know
[3:31:13.480 --> 3:31:21.200]  gold is the only asset that I see that is supported by financial history by the
[3:31:21.200 --> 3:31:25.800]  laws of finance and Alex bridging into what you kindly just brought up I
[3:31:25.800 --> 3:31:30.720]  believe gold is the only asset that the good book specifically counsels us to
[3:31:30.720 --> 3:31:36.840]  buy so that we may grow wealthy and triangulating on those three again I
[3:31:36.840 --> 3:31:42.000]  believe it solidifies the case for having some in a portfolio today and the
[3:31:42.000 --> 3:31:45.840]  big question is just get it from a reputable good group and you guys have
[3:31:45.840 --> 3:31:50.200]  great prices and you've got a lot of the fly-by-night folks and even some of them
[3:31:50.200 --> 3:31:53.280]  around they will take your money now they don't have the gold and then try to
[3:31:53.280 --> 3:31:58.680]  get it the gold you have is ready to ship the goal we have we are currently
[3:31:58.680 --> 3:32:01.920]  shipping within three weeks of what you see on our website so when you come to
[3:32:01.920 --> 3:32:07.120]  our website you'll see approximately 40 items today that we have listed gold
[3:32:07.120 --> 3:32:10.920]  silver platinum apladium they are scheduled to ship within three weeks
[3:32:10.920 --> 3:32:15.960]  part of that is incoming timing on the shipments and also part of it is the
[3:32:15.960 --> 3:32:19.360]  packing queue but it's not like you're gonna go and you're gonna see now other
[3:32:19.360 --> 3:32:22.800]  folks are making people wait two three four months but here's the key I don't
[3:32:22.800 --> 3:32:26.240]  know your whole business but I've been in it before you guys are putting contracts
[3:32:26.240 --> 3:32:29.840]  in with the mint right she got a wait till it's actually made some cases we
[3:32:29.840 --> 3:32:34.200]  have to wait we wait till we're either buying it back from secondary market
[3:32:34.200 --> 3:32:38.880]  sellers we're buying it as new as the market is so hot that literally it's
[3:32:38.880 --> 3:32:43.840]  gone out the door before you can even get it just as you get it US Eagle gold
[3:32:43.840 --> 3:32:47.880]  US Eagles are trading at record premiums right now silver Eagles are at
[3:32:47.880 --> 3:32:54.640]  record premiums and historically Alex that has been an indicator of what may
[3:32:54.640 --> 3:32:57.840]  be coming is oh yeah appreciate that's when gold went from a thousand to two
[3:32:57.840 --> 3:33:00.960]  thousand last time was just boom when that happens it seems to be the physical
[3:33:00.960 --> 3:33:05.840]  markets were anticipating with the paper markets hadn't yet understood and last
[3:33:05.840 --> 3:33:10.160]  time they were able to manipulate gold prices and do all the you know things in
[3:33:10.160 --> 3:33:13.640]  the market but I'm told from a lot of people I researched that that the
[3:33:13.640 --> 3:33:16.920]  inflation is so bad this time they're gonna have real trouble suppressing gold
[3:33:16.920 --> 3:33:23.040]  much longer I think that when you just step back and look you know again we
[3:33:23.040 --> 3:33:27.120]  can't say exactly what will be the exogenous event that will cause the
[3:33:27.120 --> 3:33:33.400]  trigger however with the the money prank that's going on it is just off the
[3:33:33.400 --> 3:33:36.400]  charts and what people stay there we'll be right back final segment and then

[3:35:50.680 --> 3:35:55.120]  have that we love and my answer is the supply chain has broken down I have to
[3:35:55.120 --> 3:35:58.720]  either reformulate or I have to lower the quality to get a lot of these and so
[3:35:58.720 --> 3:36:02.000]  that's why we don't have a lot of products in that's why info wars is in
[3:36:02.000 --> 3:36:05.200]  financial trouble is because if we had the product you would be buying it we
[3:36:05.200 --> 3:36:08.880]  have the money but so many of them have been sold out just like you noticed a
[3:36:08.880 --> 3:36:12.480]  lot of other items at the store aren't available because civilization is being
[3:36:12.480 --> 3:36:18.240]  artificially imploded but finally x2 is back in stock the good halogen deep
[3:36:18.240 --> 3:36:21.720]  earth crystal iodine so essential in your body it's really the missing link

[3:36:26.680 --> 3:36:30.200]  ready to sell out we'll have to go back to near full price take advantage of this
[3:36:30.200 --> 3:36:33.760]  now stock up and don't forget to take your x2 because I have a tendency to
[3:36:33.760 --> 3:36:39.040]  forget how great it is not taking myself but when I do stamina libido energy
[3:36:39.040 --> 3:36:42.880]  weight loss it's incredible it's essential it's x2 at info wars store.com
[3:36:42.880 --> 3:36:47.600]  14 months ago I began to see on the broadcast every day when the first world
[3:36:47.600 --> 3:36:52.280]  collapses the third world dies we have such a complex civilization with so many
[3:36:52.280 --> 3:36:56.760]  billions of moving parts that when you shut down the first world it causes a
[3:36:56.760 --> 3:37:00.880]  chain reaction that will devastate the third world and really hurt the first
[3:37:00.880 --> 3:37:04.840]  world well now you're hearing about gas shortages all over the United States
[3:37:04.840 --> 3:37:08.360]  that's because the companies and the systems and the drivers that could
[3:37:08.360 --> 3:37:12.400]  barely get the job done before delivering gas had been shut down plus the
[3:37:12.400 --> 3:37:15.920]  keystone pipelines been shut down along with other pipelines the left is now
[3:37:15.920 --> 3:37:20.840]  blowing up dams across the US we're being shut down our coal power plants are
[3:37:20.840 --> 3:37:25.560]  off as well ladies and gentlemen prepare to be a total slave the third world is
[3:37:25.560 --> 3:37:28.720]  imploding as well the borders have been removed until you wake up and this is a
[3:37:28.720 --> 3:37:33.080]  globalist chai-com takeover very recent you have no hope they're announcing that
[3:37:33.080 --> 3:37:38.120]  there will be less than two-thirds the gas needed this summer so they told you
[3:37:38.120 --> 3:37:41.280]  that you're under lockdown one way or another and CNN laughed at you and your
[3:37:41.280 --> 3:37:43.560]  family
[3:37:43.560 --> 3:38:04.840]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show well oh Biden's spokesperson the third
[3:38:04.840 --> 3:38:09.600]  Obama administration's frontman came out and said oh cyber ransom and cyber
[3:38:09.600 --> 3:38:14.240]  attacks are a thing he's got to get used to clocks kicking on colonial pipeline
[3:38:14.240 --> 3:38:18.360]  restart after 72 hours it gets really tough and now they've declared a
[3:38:18.360 --> 3:38:23.920]  national emergency over that held hostage oh what did Klaus Schwab say and
[3:38:23.920 --> 3:38:27.120]  what do they say this new cyber polygon put up by John Hopkins saying folks
[3:38:27.120 --> 3:38:30.560]  brought you the whole COVID attack what I tell you two weeks ago I said they're
[3:38:30.560 --> 3:38:34.440]  gonna launch cyber attacks shutting down pipelines because it's not the chai-coms
[3:38:34.440 --> 3:38:38.040]  it's it's it's the globalist it's Biden they're doing this to bring America to
[3:38:38.040 --> 3:38:43.040]  its knees just like they wouldn't let Texas up its power output during during
[3:38:43.040 --> 3:38:46.440]  that winter storm that was in the federal and state documents this is an
[3:38:46.440 --> 3:38:50.200]  attack it's all in the fourth industrial revolution that Klaus Schwab
[3:38:50.200 --> 3:38:55.520]  writes about it's all in the COVID-19 great reset these criminals brag about
[3:38:55.520 --> 3:38:59.440]  the whole plan and here he is on national French TV so we need a world
[3:38:59.440 --> 3:39:05.800]  government with a world ID medical passport with an implantable ship that's
[3:39:05.800 --> 3:39:09.320]  on national French television so the Bible is being fulfilled and the time
[3:39:09.320 --> 3:39:12.320]  when you went fast I know you've got to leave tomorrow you're gonna be on the
[3:39:12.320 --> 3:39:15.640]  other shows I'm gonna be watching but you got ten minutes left but you wanted
[3:39:15.640 --> 3:39:18.680]  to make that one last point about gold and you were gonna talk about the real
[3:39:18.680 --> 3:39:24.840]  thing our spiritual salvation here thank you there is so much good news I
[3:39:24.840 --> 3:39:29.600]  think we want to segue into Alex obviously the headlines are daunting
[3:39:29.600 --> 3:39:34.920]  sobering but I want to share I really believe there are great blessings
[3:39:34.920 --> 3:39:38.960]  coming to America we look at the world we try to look at the world through three
[3:39:38.960 --> 3:39:44.760]  lenses first and foremost as Christians secondly as Americans we love this
[3:39:44.760 --> 3:39:49.600]  country we've been so blessed to be born here to be beneficiaries of all the
[3:39:49.600 --> 3:39:53.280]  servicemen who have given their lives for our freedom and then we try and look
[3:39:53.280 --> 3:39:57.680]  at the world through the lens of capitalism but if you are Christian
[3:39:57.680 --> 3:40:02.880]  we've had just so many extraordinarily wonderful things happening that have not
[3:40:02.880 --> 3:40:06.520]  been being reported on one I just want to highlight because it's one of the few
[3:40:06.520 --> 3:40:11.800]  occasions we can triangulate where we are in time in my opinion specifically to
[3:40:11.800 --> 3:40:19.040]  revelation that's a big claim but in 2017 astronomers conceded the incredible
[3:40:19.040 --> 3:40:22.760]  sign that appeared in the heavens looked like it was from Revelation 12 and
[3:40:22.760 --> 3:40:27.720]  that was a wonderful story it was the birthing of the Savior this isn't
[3:40:27.720 --> 3:40:31.760]  Bethlehem this was st. John 2,000 years ago we predicted one celestial event
[3:40:31.760 --> 3:40:37.600]  it was September of 2017 the birthing the rebirthing of the Savior st. John said
[3:40:37.600 --> 3:40:45.200]  he's he then went into the wilderness for 1260 days with the virgin his mother
[3:40:45.200 --> 3:40:52.280]  1260 days expired this March so I can't tell you exactly what that means this
[3:40:52.280 --> 3:40:56.840]  clearly appears to be an echo of Bethlehem where Christ was born her it
[3:40:56.840 --> 3:41:02.080]  killed all the unborn but Christ and st. Joseph and Mary exited they went to
[3:41:02.080 --> 3:41:06.040]  Africa they were there for approximately 1260 days and when they came back into
[3:41:06.040 --> 3:41:11.160]  the world they brought so many good blessings with them of every type and
[3:41:11.160 --> 3:41:16.920]  I believe that is what we are on the verge of experiencing here an unleashing
[3:41:16.920 --> 3:41:23.680]  of truth that is coming we didn't have a ton of time to get into it but I think
[3:41:23.680 --> 3:41:30.480]  the ultimate info war is in Scripture and it has to do with fasting and with
[3:41:30.480 --> 3:41:37.640]  fasting because Christ said clearly when evil is at its most intense the only
[3:41:37.640 --> 3:41:42.880]  way that you can conquer it is when you combine your prayer with fasting prayer
[3:41:42.880 --> 3:41:47.320]  alone won't work until folks had passage in the Bible or several but so if you
[3:41:47.320 --> 3:41:53.760]  if you want to put it up mark 929 for centuries talked about those words from
[3:41:53.760 --> 3:41:58.120]  Jesus if you look at the King James version still today if you're Protestant
[3:41:58.120 --> 3:42:01.560]  or Catholics if you look at the old Dewey reams version that always said the
[3:42:01.560 --> 3:42:07.560]  same thing prayer and fasting the point was fasting as required to defeat evil
[3:42:07.560 --> 3:42:14.920]  in the 1960s an amazing info war happened all the Catholic Bibles and now
[3:42:14.920 --> 3:42:20.160]  about 40% of the Protestant Bibles were changed so they've taken the word
[3:42:20.160 --> 3:42:25.560]  fasting out by the way Jesus went out in the wilderness and fasted before he
[3:42:25.560 --> 3:42:29.760]  confronted Saint for 40 days and it is it was a stinging defeat and that is the
[3:42:29.760 --> 3:42:35.200]  point every time you see in Scripture believers fasting it leads to a stinging
[3:42:35.200 --> 3:42:40.760]  defeat for evil and we are there are so many wonderful stories about what is
[3:42:40.760 --> 3:42:44.320]  happening and the power what happens because you don't have the food that's
[3:42:44.320 --> 3:42:48.080]  earthly it like sends the veil your connection to God or like like
[3:42:48.080 --> 3:42:51.720]  scientifically you know it's science to God gave us science what is the
[3:42:51.720 --> 3:42:55.120]  scientific basis I know people that fast really have more visions they get
[3:42:55.120 --> 3:42:58.560]  more clairvoyant what happens well maybe tomorrow we can dig into it in a
[3:42:58.560 --> 3:43:03.280]  ton of detail I would love to do that but it is also very simple and I would
[3:43:03.280 --> 3:43:08.560]  say we've been blessed for over a decade now to write twice a week encouraging
[3:43:08.560 --> 3:43:12.360]  Americans to fast with us twice a week specifically for the restoration of our
[3:43:12.360 --> 3:43:15.760]  country for the protection of our military the protection of our police
[3:43:15.760 --> 3:43:20.320]  protection of our firefighters and the way we do it is shockingly easy Alex we
[3:43:20.320 --> 3:43:24.320]  do it in the mode of first century Christians which is bread and water
[3:43:24.320 --> 3:43:28.560]  hundred percent whole grain breads it is surprisingly easy and you may say well
[3:43:28.560 --> 3:43:33.040]  how can that do any good how can that be so powerful it's so easy and what I
[3:43:33.040 --> 3:43:37.400]  would say to you is it's a little bit like salvation it doesn't matter how
[3:43:37.400 --> 3:43:42.160]  much you do because Jesus did what he did on the cross for us the doors are
[3:43:42.160 --> 3:43:45.360]  opened and God is just looking for a little bit of participation with us and
[3:43:45.360 --> 3:43:50.200]  it's the same with fasting the key is we believe when you make this little
[3:43:50.200 --> 3:43:54.840]  sacrifice is your heart and you say Lord this is just a little sacrifice
[3:43:54.840 --> 3:43:59.320]  compared to what you did for me but to advance your kingdom to bring down your
[3:43:59.320 --> 3:44:03.400]  Holy Spirit I gladly make this little sacrifice for you and then it's a
[3:44:03.400 --> 3:44:06.800]  constant reminder while you're fasting of God and that makes you resonate
[3:44:06.800 --> 3:44:12.520]  stronger amen and what I believe what I see happening Alex is it's like scales
[3:44:12.520 --> 3:44:15.880]  fall from your eyes if you look at scriptures of people who fasted they
[3:44:15.880 --> 3:44:19.680]  had incredible insights into what was going on they were the people who first
[3:44:19.680 --> 3:44:24.960]  saw and recognized the Messiah and then what's so exciting for America is I mean
[3:44:24.960 --> 3:44:29.120]  look at the civilizations like Nineveh it was slated for destruction period end
[3:44:29.120 --> 3:44:35.280]  of story when the people fasted then God spared Nineveh we had and we see the
[3:44:35.280 --> 3:44:39.640]  same thing with Esther the great Jewish story when she and the people fasted
[3:44:39.640 --> 3:44:44.360]  they were slated for extinction all the Jews were going to be killed and a
[3:44:44.360 --> 3:44:50.320]  miracle ensued so we usually fast twice a week on bread and water it's very easy
[3:44:50.320 --> 3:44:56.200]  but I'd like to do today Alex is I am going to try and do something starting
[3:44:56.200 --> 3:44:59.360]  tomorrow and I'd like to invite the audience with us to replicate this
[3:44:59.360 --> 3:45:05.080]  Esther fast the Esther fast culminated on the 13th of the month Thursday is going
[3:45:05.080 --> 3:45:11.640]  to be the 13th May 13th I am going to I am going to try to fast in the only way
[3:45:11.640 --> 3:45:16.800]  Esther said specifically and that is three days without anything to eat or
[3:45:16.800 --> 3:45:20.080]  anything to drink and I'm telling you up front I don't know if I'm going to make
[3:45:20.080 --> 3:45:25.600]  it every time I start out on something like this it's daunting it's a 72 step
[3:45:25.600 --> 3:45:31.400]  meaning 72 hour mountain but I'm going to aspire why because that was a recipe
[3:45:31.400 --> 3:45:37.000]  specifically that Esther called from and a moment of national crisis and God
[3:45:37.000 --> 3:45:40.640]  responded so what do I believe is going to happen I believe what we're going to
[3:45:40.640 --> 3:45:44.840]  see next is that all these patriots and Christians across the country who've been
[3:45:44.840 --> 3:45:49.880]  saying I want to do something fasting is a free way you can do it but I don't
[3:45:49.880 --> 3:45:54.040]  know what to do you've been saying I expect that the Holy Spirit is going to
[3:45:54.040 --> 3:45:59.480]  be inspiring people local leaders who have been AWOL who haven't been stepping
[3:45:59.480 --> 3:46:02.720]  forward with the courage and the insights as to how to lead they will get the
[3:46:02.720 --> 3:46:06.680]  insights as to what to do with the local level and I want to reach out to
[3:46:06.680 --> 3:46:11.200]  everyone say try it no matter how you do it try it with us these next three days
[3:46:11.200 --> 3:46:15.600]  we're going to ask God to pour out incredible blessings upon America one of
[3:46:15.600 --> 3:46:20.600]  the greatest side benefits of fasting a 5th century evangelist Asterius said
[3:46:20.600 --> 3:46:27.160]  he saw that when families fast the angels protect those families what an
[3:46:27.160 --> 3:46:30.800]  incredible blessing all parents should be aware of in this world to have extra
[3:46:30.800 --> 3:46:34.800]  protection from drugs everything for your children and I'm expecting that we
[3:46:34.800 --> 3:46:38.720]  are going to begin to see wonderful wonderful blessings but we know we're
[3:46:38.720 --> 3:46:42.760]  getting killed by all the plenty that's what Satan does is just anesthetize this
[3:46:42.760 --> 3:46:45.880]  with all the entertainment all the food all the drink myself included and I've
[3:46:45.880 --> 3:46:48.320]  been attending to start going on intermittent fast but I tell you I'll
[3:46:48.320 --> 3:46:52.880]  join you in one day of fasting I can't do three I start going really crazy but
[3:46:52.880 --> 3:46:57.200]  yeah people should definitely do that and I mean regardless Alex let me suggest
[3:46:57.200 --> 3:47:02.040]  so don't go three days with nothing eat or nothing to drink try it let's go for
[3:47:02.040 --> 3:47:04.560]  three days let's try bread and water you can put a little olive oil on it you
[3:47:04.560 --> 3:47:08.760]  can put some butter on it you can put some almond butter on it it's just
[3:47:08.760 --> 3:47:12.760]  making a little sound sure I do that and and restricting our drink to water and
[3:47:12.760 --> 3:47:16.600]  we're just saying lose my name was amen it's a it's a side that you look great
[3:47:16.600 --> 3:47:20.480]  you fast a lot you're telling me I do I listen we're out of time you're gonna
