[00:00.000 --> 00:05.120]  The top military officer says a fixed timetable for U.S. troop withdrawal from Iraq could
[00:05.120 --> 00:08.320]  put political and economic progress at risk.
[00:08.320 --> 00:12.800]  Speaking on Fox News Sunday, Admiral Mike Mullen says the best way to determine troop
[00:12.800 --> 00:15.520]  levels is based on conditions on the ground.
[00:15.520 --> 00:21.560]  The strategic goals of having time horizons are ones that we all see because eventually
[00:21.560 --> 00:26.320]  we would like to see U.S. forces draw down and eventually all come home.
[00:26.320 --> 00:30.360]  The U.S. Democratic presidential candidate is in Afghanistan.
[00:30.360 --> 00:31.760]  Here's Fishnick Abrashi.
[00:31.760 --> 00:38.640]  Barack Obama met on Sunday with President Hamid Karzai and told the Afghan leader that
[00:38.640 --> 00:42.400]  he will pursue the war entire with Uighur if he's elected.
[00:42.400 --> 00:47.360]  Obama is on the second day of an overseas tour aimed at bolstering his foreign policy
[00:47.360 --> 00:48.840]  credentials.
[00:48.840 --> 00:53.040]  This is IRN, USA Radio News.
[00:53.040 --> 00:55.840]  It works, it works, it works, it works.
[00:55.840 --> 00:58.160]  And what's best is it works from home.
[00:58.160 --> 01:00.160]  Hi, how in the world are you anyway?
[01:00.160 --> 01:04.400]  This is Andy Willoughby from the threestepplan.com home business system.
[01:04.400 --> 01:08.720]  The dramatic difference with threestepplan.com is that it does work.
[01:08.720 --> 01:13.040]  And after almost five years, I think that even the most diehard skeptic would have to
[01:13.040 --> 01:18.680]  agree there must be something different about the threestepplan.com home business system.
[01:18.680 --> 01:23.440]  You see, we operate more like a mini franchise, so you get the expertise of people who have
[01:23.440 --> 01:28.360]  actually been successful working at home to help and guide you in operating your home
[01:28.360 --> 01:29.360]  business.
[01:29.360 --> 01:33.120]  It's kind of like a McDonald's franchise without the teenagers and big startup expense.
[01:33.120 --> 01:35.640]  And of course, we don't sell hamburgers.
[01:35.640 --> 01:40.240]  You do get to work with some really nice people who share similar family values.
[01:40.240 --> 01:45.120]  To find out how you can make more money working from home, go to threestepplan.com or call
[01:45.120 --> 01:46.120]  800-480-2102.
[01:46.120 --> 01:47.120]  800-480-2102.
[01:47.120 --> 01:58.280]  Tropical storm Cristobal is cutting a slow path off the North Carolina coast.
[01:58.280 --> 02:03.040]  The storm's heaviest winds and rains have stayed well offshore, though it's led to strong
[02:03.040 --> 02:05.080]  currents along the beaches.
[02:05.080 --> 02:07.600]  Here's weather bug meteorologist Steve Prince of Ailey.
[02:07.600 --> 02:11.840]  It's moving northeast near six with maximum sustained winds of 45 miles an hour.
[02:11.840 --> 02:16.240]  Now, some strengthening is possible Sunday and into the day on Monday.
[02:16.240 --> 02:21.560]  Barack Obama's week-long trip includes a stop in Germany where he'll give a speech on trans-Atlantic
[02:21.560 --> 02:25.120]  relations at Berlin's gold-top victory column.
[02:25.120 --> 02:30.120]  The Democrat had wanted to make remarks at the Brandenburg Gate side of President Reagan's
[02:30.120 --> 02:35.600]  famed address, but Chancellor Angela Merkel made it clear she didn't like the idea.
[02:35.600 --> 02:40.440]  And there's a military streak in Ann Dunwoody's family a couple centuries long.
[02:40.440 --> 02:45.260]  The 55-year-old Lieutenant General has been nominated to be the first female four-star
[02:45.260 --> 02:47.440]  general in U.S. history.
[02:47.440 --> 02:53.040]  For more news and analysis, log on to irnnews.com.
[02:53.040 --> 02:54.040]  You're finally there.
[02:54.040 --> 02:56.960]  You've taken your idea and turned it into a reality.
[02:56.960 --> 02:57.960]  You're starting a business.

[03:23.280 --> 03:27.240]  Pope Benedict has told hundreds of thousands of young people that it's up to them to preserve
[03:27.240 --> 03:31.280]  the spiritual dessert that he says is spreading throughout the world.
[03:31.280 --> 03:37.280]  I look forward to seeing you again in three years time.
[03:37.280 --> 03:42.280]  World Youth Day 2011 will take place in Madrid, Spain.
[03:42.280 --> 03:47.160]  It will take addressed and estimated 350,000 people in Sydney, Australia on the closing
[03:47.160 --> 03:50.960]  day of the Catholic Church's World Youth Day Festival.
[03:50.960 --> 03:55.200]  The political call for a gas tax holiday for the summer has given way to the view that
[03:55.200 --> 03:59.900]  taxes on fuel will have to go up if they go anywhere at all.
[03:59.900 --> 04:04.760]  The reality of depriving the Highway Trust fund of $9 billion at a time when it's already
[04:04.760 --> 04:10.280]  heading for a projected $3 billion deficit next year doomed the idea.
[04:10.280 --> 04:14.800]  U.S. drivers are still paying a lot less in gas taxes than people in Europe.
[04:14.800 --> 04:16.280]  Here's Bob Eller.
[04:16.280 --> 04:21.320]  Including state and local levies, Americans pay about $0.47 on average in taxes for a
[04:21.320 --> 04:23.080]  gallon of gasoline.
[04:23.080 --> 04:28.920]  Fuel in many European countries cost $8 to $9 a gallon, with half or more of that going
[04:28.920 --> 04:29.920]  to taxes.
[04:29.920 --> 04:33.720]  And Brett Favre is sticking to the script, declining to address his public rift with
[04:33.720 --> 04:38.040]  the Green Bay Packers in an appearance at Lambeau Field on Saturday.
[04:38.040 --> 04:43.080]  He says it was nice to be named Packers MVP for last season, and football is about one
[04:43.080 --> 04:44.080]  thing.
[04:44.080 --> 04:48.120]  It's all about the team, and I hope I have never lost sight of that.
[04:48.120 --> 04:53.320]  I'm Jody Jordan, and that's news from the Information Radio Network.
[04:53.320 --> 04:54.320]  It's a fact.
[04:54.320 --> 04:58.240]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States
[04:58.240 --> 05:01.760]  create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[05:01.760 --> 05:05.440]  With never ending late fees over the limit fees and higher and higher interest rates,
[05:05.440 --> 05:09.920]  it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to
[05:09.920 --> 05:10.920]  our creditors.
[05:10.920 --> 05:15.240]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful attorney-backed program to legally
[05:15.240 --> 05:19.400]  eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts
[05:19.400 --> 05:21.680]  which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[05:21.680 --> 05:25.960]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment,
[05:25.960 --> 05:28.120]  ending with nothing on your credit report.
[05:28.120 --> 05:31.800]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally
[05:31.800 --> 05:33.360]  eliminated their debt.
[05:33.360 --> 05:37.080]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life
[05:37.080 --> 05:38.080]  around.
[05:38.080 --> 05:42.240]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[05:42.240 --> 05:47.080]  That's 877-943-8600, or visit FDRS.org.
[05:47.080 --> 05:49.720]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[05:49.720 --> 06:04.200]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[06:04.200 --> 06:32.920]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-590-5525.
[06:32.920 --> 06:37.360]  Hello, and thank you for joining us for a very important Sunday edition.
[06:37.360 --> 06:42.360]  I'm on the radio six days a week Monday through Friday, and I come back in Sunday evenings
[06:42.360 --> 06:49.880]  afternoons, 4 to 6 p.m. Central Standard Time to do a two-hour abbreviated special
[06:49.880 --> 06:50.880]  report.
[06:50.880 --> 06:56.800]  Tonight is very important, you know, driving in with the magnitude of news and information
[06:56.800 --> 07:00.720]  I have here in front of me.
[07:00.720 --> 07:05.240]  I, a lot of times, don't fill up to the task, because I know the information I'm covering
[07:05.240 --> 07:06.880]  is accurate.
[07:06.880 --> 07:13.080]  The information is so well documented that there's no way for me to properly even prove
[07:13.080 --> 07:14.080]  all of it on air.
[07:14.080 --> 07:18.080]  I mean, I can give you a lot of the proof, but to go over the complete proof would take
[07:18.080 --> 07:19.240]  thousands of hours.
[07:19.240 --> 07:24.040]  There's that much evidence to everything we discuss here, and then I think about the
[07:24.040 --> 07:28.760]  fact that, conservatively, one hour of this Sunday radio show that's smaller than the
[07:28.760 --> 07:34.960]  older weekday show, about a million people tune in and out of it, and around a million
[07:34.960 --> 07:40.520]  and a half people total over the two hours, I've got two million listeners tuning in every
[07:40.520 --> 07:41.520]  day.
[07:41.520 --> 07:44.480]  That's conservative off MNFM stations that happen to have ratings and, you know, that
[07:44.480 --> 07:48.880]  happen to subscribe to the ratings, so we know the type of listenership that we have.
[07:48.880 --> 07:53.880]  And then, of course, on the Internet, number one on Shotcast, with hundreds of thousands
[07:53.880 --> 07:58.960]  listening at any one time around the world, millions in the aggregate every week.
[07:58.960 --> 08:05.600]  But number one on Shotcast, number one on all the other major Internet rating services
[08:05.600 --> 08:09.360]  out there, number one on YouTube, number one on Google.
[08:09.360 --> 08:15.720]  In fact, in the Google Top 100 videos, routinely, 10 of them are mine, including the coveted
[08:15.720 --> 08:16.720]  number one spot.
[08:16.720 --> 08:18.280]  Go look for yourself right now.
[08:18.280 --> 08:23.200]  It's the same on every other rating system, and you would think that I would have a big
[08:23.200 --> 08:25.040]  ego or be heady about that.
[08:25.040 --> 08:27.240]  It is really the opposite.
[08:27.240 --> 08:35.160]  It is quite a responsibility for me, because, frankly, I listen to my radio show, the rebroadcast
[08:35.160 --> 08:38.120]  often and don't like what I have to hear, my delivery.
[08:38.120 --> 08:43.240]  Or I think of, for each issue, I cover hundreds of points that I wanted to make, because it's
[08:43.240 --> 08:47.240]  easy driving down the road in your car or listening on the computer at night or watching
[08:47.240 --> 08:52.400]  some YouTube clip of yourself talk with the video added, because we videotaped this and
[08:52.400 --> 08:56.960]  put it on the prisonplanet.tv area and people put it all over the web.
[08:56.960 --> 09:02.600]  It's easy in hindsight to want to make all these other points and then not get to it.
[09:02.600 --> 09:09.080]  Bottom line, ladies and gentlemen, you'd better take the issues and topics and news that I'm
[09:09.080 --> 09:14.960]  covering here very, very seriously.
[09:14.960 --> 09:21.240]  You can't afford to just laugh and scoff or say that I'm exaggerating or that I'm fear
[09:21.240 --> 09:27.840]  mongering, because in reality, and this is analyzing myself and what I cover and what
[09:27.840 --> 09:39.240]  my guests cover here, the situation we face is far worse than what I can even articulate.
[09:39.240 --> 09:46.040]  So I'm begging you listeners to realize that human history has been fraught with disaster
[09:46.040 --> 09:56.160]  and mass murder by the government, enslavement, theft, depression, abject tyranny and pain.
[09:56.160 --> 09:57.880]  And that is the norm.
[09:57.880 --> 10:05.720]  Liberty is the rare jewel, the one in a million exception.
[10:05.720 --> 10:12.000]  Liberty creates amazing success, milk and honey, great prosperity.
[10:12.000 --> 10:20.320]  And so countries, the handful of nations that have had some modicum of liberty in all of
[10:20.320 --> 10:26.000]  human recorded 6,000 years of history can be counted up on less than two hands.
[10:26.000 --> 10:32.480]  It's hard to fill up all 10 of your fingers.
[10:32.480 --> 10:37.760]  It's hard to go through a list and you can debate the last three or four.
[10:37.760 --> 10:43.160]  There's really only six or seven nations or empires or systems that can be called somewhat
[10:43.160 --> 10:45.520]  free.
[10:45.520 --> 10:49.560]  Somehow they convince the general public in the last 50 years that there is no tyranny,
[10:49.560 --> 10:53.760]  nothing bad in government, trust everything, let government be secret under the guise of
[10:53.760 --> 10:58.160]  national security, let private interest come in and buy off the government.
[10:58.160 --> 11:02.400]  Everything's wonderful, government is only good, things never go wrong, bad things never
[11:02.400 --> 11:05.400]  happen inside government.
[11:05.400 --> 11:12.640]  It is God, government is good, government is sweet, it is wonderful, it is to be trusted
[11:12.640 --> 11:16.040]  and everything is fine.
[11:16.040 --> 11:20.920]  If you know anything about history or even U.S. history, you know how asinine and ridiculous
[11:20.920 --> 11:23.640]  that is.
[11:23.640 --> 11:28.400]  Or if you can convince somebody that there's problems in government, they will then say,
[11:28.400 --> 11:33.720]  well, there's problems in one party, there's problems with the Republicans or there's problems
[11:33.720 --> 11:38.200]  with the Democrats and then they get caught up so intensely in the debate about which
[11:38.200 --> 11:44.480]  party they're for, they never realize that both parties for at least 40 years have been
[11:44.480 --> 11:50.840]  run completely by foreign corporate interest.
[11:50.840 --> 11:56.240]  Who do not have your interest at stake and in fact are quite predatory towards you and
[11:56.240 --> 12:06.200]  see this country as an apple to be looted, to be gang raped financially, economically.
[12:06.200 --> 12:09.760]  And they've written hundreds of books and thousands of think tank documents on it and
[12:09.760 --> 12:14.360]  our own Pentagon and Naval War College and British Ministry of Defense say the people
[12:14.360 --> 12:19.720]  are the enemy, say North Com is martial law, we're already under, targeting the United
[12:19.720 --> 12:24.200]  States population as enemies of the state and the British target their people as enemies
[12:24.200 --> 12:26.880]  of the state and they state it all.
[12:26.880 --> 12:32.960]  This is a corrupt elite publicly declaring war on you.
[12:32.960 --> 12:37.080]  You know in history the castles weren't built for invasion, that rarely happened.
[12:37.080 --> 12:42.480]  The castles were built for the local nobles to be armored at night and to be in a keep
[12:42.480 --> 12:45.720]  from the public that they enslaved and controlled.
[12:45.720 --> 12:52.600]  And that's all that we see happening here today with the high tech integration overlay.
[12:52.600 --> 12:57.080]  Let me give you the news and I'm going to cover this news in as much detail as I can
[12:57.080 --> 13:03.280]  just hitting the high points or we should call them the low points.
[13:03.280 --> 13:07.560]  Then we're going to take calls, wide open phones in the second hour and then cover some
[13:07.560 --> 13:13.600]  economic news with a whimper, not a bang.
[13:13.600 --> 13:24.640]  The Chicago Tribune and NBC channel 5 WMAQ out of Chicago announced Thursday that the
[13:24.640 --> 13:32.520]  U.S. military will be in Chicago and statewide confiscating firearms out of citizens' homes.
[13:32.520 --> 13:36.840]  Just completely calm, I played a clip of this Thursday on the radio, I'm not going to play
[13:36.840 --> 13:37.840]  it today.
[13:37.840 --> 13:43.240]  If you want to just Google, governor says Chicago is out of control, it will pop up,
[13:43.240 --> 13:45.120]  you can watch the video link.
[13:45.120 --> 13:50.400]  There's now three of them on there, Thursday that was just video governor's plan.
[13:50.400 --> 13:57.360]  Now there's read viewers, sound off and more politics, you can watch more clips on it.
[13:57.360 --> 14:00.640]  We're going to go over that and give you the full import of what that means.
[14:00.640 --> 14:05.240]  You don't think they're just going to announce martial law and ring big bells from the church
[14:05.240 --> 14:06.760]  tops and tell you they're slaves?
[14:06.760 --> 14:11.280]  Oh, the troops are going to be coming in your houses confiscating guns because guns
[14:11.280 --> 14:15.000]  are illegal in most areas of Illinois and we don't care what the Supreme Court has to
[14:15.000 --> 14:17.840]  say and we've got federal grants to take your guns.
[14:17.840 --> 14:22.200]  And all over the country, the police with the feds are raiding homes without warrants
[14:22.200 --> 14:24.400]  quote looking for guns.
[14:24.400 --> 14:28.200]  We'll go over all of that.
[14:28.200 --> 14:32.000]  All over the nation, they're running warrantless checkpoints and then we have video police
[14:32.000 --> 14:39.000]  from D.C. to L.A. to San Diego to Dallas just walking up and saying don't videotape
[14:39.000 --> 14:40.000]  us running a checkpoint.
[14:40.000 --> 14:44.640]  And he says, well, I have a right and the cops start beating you in the head.
[14:44.640 --> 14:50.760]  I mean, that's martial law, ladies and gentlemen.
[14:50.760 --> 14:52.160]  That's martial law.
[14:52.160 --> 14:59.640]  Hey, you slave, you don't videotape our operations and remember, these are battle hardened people
[14:59.640 --> 15:03.880]  who've had mental breakdowns on the average four tours, they're on Prozac, they're back
[15:03.880 --> 15:09.200]  in uniform, totally psychopathic police are murdering their families all over the place
[15:09.200 --> 15:10.200]  every day.
[15:10.200 --> 15:13.600]  I see five or six articles about that because they come home, get put in uniform, melt down,
[15:13.600 --> 15:14.600]  kill their families normally.
[15:14.600 --> 15:18.480]  And as bad as that is, at least they're only killing their families and not us on the streets.
[15:18.480 --> 15:22.480]  I'm sad they're killing their women and children, but you know, that's what psychopathic meltdowns
[15:22.480 --> 15:23.480]  do.
[15:23.480 --> 15:26.960]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, I haven't got into Barack Obama, a million
[15:26.960 --> 15:29.680]  man's armed Stasi force.
[15:29.680 --> 15:32.840]  They will be youth brigades coming after your guns.
[15:32.840 --> 15:34.880]  You can't make this type stuff up.
[15:34.880 --> 15:37.280]  You are witnessing the fall of the Republic.
[15:37.280 --> 15:40.040]  Will you hear the call and rally to her aid?
[15:40.040 --> 15:41.040]  Probably not.
[15:41.040 --> 15:53.680]  Suck your thumbs and prepare to go down with the ship, we'll be right back.
[15:53.680 --> 15:58.680]  Question is the world getting better or vastly worse?
[15:58.680 --> 16:03.680]  A world economic collapse could come any day.
[16:03.680 --> 16:09.840]  Question are you prepared or are you ignoring the signs?
[16:09.840 --> 16:17.480]  Question do you have seven years of healthy food for your family?

[16:47.880 --> 16:52.560]  Do it now or become property of the new world order.
[16:52.560 --> 16:56.120]  Hello Ted Anderson, listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note
[16:56.120 --> 16:58.520]  and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[16:58.520 --> 17:02.840]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently
[17:02.840 --> 17:06.480]  placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[17:06.480 --> 17:10.840]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve
[17:10.840 --> 17:12.520]  for immediate withdrawal.
[17:12.520 --> 17:16.520]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to ensure deposits
[17:16.520 --> 17:19.320]  during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[17:19.320 --> 17:23.880]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity
[17:23.880 --> 17:24.880]  for depositors.
[17:24.880 --> 17:29.200]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity can cause
[17:29.200 --> 17:30.200]  inflation.
[17:30.200 --> 17:34.440]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all
[17:34.440 --> 17:38.160]  investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[17:38.160 --> 17:42.880]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value
[17:42.880 --> 17:44.640]  for over 6,000 years.
[17:44.640 --> 17:48.600]  For more information call 1-800-686-2237.
[17:48.600 --> 17:53.000]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[17:53.000 --> 17:58.040]  With oil at $105 per barrel and counting, we need radical change if we're to avert becoming
[17:58.040 --> 17:59.240]  a third world nation.
[17:59.240 --> 18:03.840]  It's time to jump on the next wave of free energy and radical natural alternative health
[18:03.840 --> 18:04.840]  solutions.
[18:04.840 --> 18:07.040]  Introducing Orgon Products.
[18:07.040 --> 18:11.080]  Orgon is the universal life force, the basic building block of all matter on the material
[18:11.080 --> 18:12.080]  planet.
[18:12.080 --> 18:16.560]  Orgon Electromedicine is the wave of the future dating back to the late 1800s.
[18:16.560 --> 18:21.240]  Will Helmreich Orgon use cloudbuster technology that can now be applied in your home for dramatic
[18:21.240 --> 18:23.800]  energy savings of up to 25 percent?
[18:23.800 --> 18:27.840]  The possible uses for this device are only limited by your imagination.
[18:27.840 --> 18:31.480]  For less than the cost of a doctor's visit, you can have a device that could lead to the
[18:31.480 --> 18:33.400]  end of all your problems.
[18:33.400 --> 18:36.040]  Health doesn't need to be expensive or complicated.
[18:36.040 --> 18:40.000]  Simple technology equals profound results at Orgonproducts.org.
[18:40.000 --> 18:43.000]  That's O-R-G-O-N-E Products.org.
[18:43.000 --> 18:45.880]  O-R-G-O-N-E Products.org.
[18:45.880 --> 18:49.320]  Or call 646-498-5309.
[18:49.320 --> 18:58.320]  Have you ever suffered from giardia, food poisoning, heavy metal poisoning, arthritis, fatigue,
[18:58.320 --> 18:59.320]  or high cholesterol?
[18:59.320 --> 19:03.480]  Maybe you're one of the 75 million Americans at the Center for Disease Control reports of
[19:03.480 --> 19:06.040]  suffering from internal parasites.
[19:06.040 --> 19:10.360]  If so, Freshwater Organics is proud to introduce you to a million-year-old miracle that has
[19:10.360 --> 19:14.480]  been used all over the world by health-conscious individuals seeking alternatives to chemicals
[19:14.480 --> 19:15.480]  and drugs.
[19:15.480 --> 19:21.520]  An FPP or fossilized phytoplankin powder is a 100% natural organic product with absolutely
[19:21.520 --> 19:22.520]  no additives.
[19:22.520 --> 19:27.320]  When taken daily, it is an excellent source of natural plant-based silica with 14 trace
[19:27.320 --> 19:28.320]  minerals.
[19:28.320 --> 19:31.000]  Many believe it is a key to a healthy digestive tract.
[19:31.000 --> 19:42.320]  To find an FPP distributor near you, or to buy it now, online, go to www.freshwaterorganics.com.
[19:42.320 --> 19:56.040]  You can also call toll-free at 888-949-3570, that's 888-949-3570.
[19:56.040 --> 19:58.520]  Are you tired of searching for great talk radio?
[19:58.520 --> 19:59.760]  Well search no more.
[19:59.760 --> 20:07.560]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[20:07.560 --> 20:09.400]  I'm going to make it very simple.
[20:09.400 --> 20:15.400]  Credit central banks took control of the nation about 85 years ago.
[20:15.400 --> 20:19.600]  They have created a world empire using our money, our credit, our name.
[20:19.600 --> 20:28.800]  While destroying everything, the Bill of Rights of Constitution stands for.
[20:28.800 --> 20:35.560]  Now the Ponzi scheme is within a few years, conservatively, may even be quicker, of totally
[20:35.560 --> 20:37.060]  imploding.
[20:37.060 --> 20:41.600]  They don't want to get criminally in trouble, in fact, they want to maintain control of
[20:41.600 --> 20:48.360]  the husk, the sucked dry nest where they were basically hatched out of, and then spread
[20:48.360 --> 20:51.000]  out worldwide with their tyranny.
[20:51.000 --> 20:56.200]  So we have provided the yoke to feed them in their egg that was the US.
[20:56.200 --> 21:02.200]  Now the global tyranny has broken out worldwide, taken over the planet, but they have to maintain
[21:02.200 --> 21:07.560]  their dominance over the original slave pit, over the original slave grid.
[21:07.560 --> 21:11.520]  And that's what they're doing now, setting up their military slave grid here in the
[21:11.520 --> 21:12.520]  United States.
[21:12.520 --> 21:18.080]  Now, before I cover this news, remember, and if you don't know this, just Google it, it's
[21:18.080 --> 21:21.560]  thousands of government websites, documents, all admitted everywhere.
[21:21.560 --> 21:26.320]  You can go to the Atomic Energy Agency website or nationally, you can go to the Department
[21:26.320 --> 21:29.840]  of Energy, they admit it.
[21:29.840 --> 21:32.160]  Where they, I use this example because it's one that's better.
[21:32.160 --> 21:37.080]  Now, there's thousands, where they took 4,300 to something, foster children, and radiated
[21:37.080 --> 21:39.520]  them to death, murdered US children.
[21:39.520 --> 21:44.240]  Oh, but the government wouldn't kill 3,000 people on 9-11, though they read all those
[21:44.240 --> 21:48.160]  think tank documents saying how they needed terror attacks to get us to get behind a global
[21:48.160 --> 21:54.480]  war of tyranny, and a domestic police state here at home, and then all the thousands
[21:54.480 --> 21:58.880]  of our troops they killed with nerve gas and chemical and biological and radiological agents
[21:58.880 --> 22:05.560]  and all declassified, well, it's all going on today, ladies and gentlemen.
[22:05.560 --> 22:10.920]  Just remember that, and then calmly, they come out in the Chicago Tribune and on NBC
[22:10.920 --> 22:14.960]  News 5, WMA Cube.
[22:14.960 --> 22:20.840]  Governor says Chicago is out of control, announces a plan with Mayor Daley to put national guard
[22:20.840 --> 22:25.120]  troops on the streets, not to fight terror.
[22:25.120 --> 22:27.160]  That was the first excuse we told you.
[22:27.160 --> 22:30.840]  For 9-11, we said there'll be a staged attack on the World Trade Center, and then we said
[22:30.840 --> 22:34.240]  the next attack will probably be on Chicago, because we have all the federal training manuals,
[22:34.240 --> 22:40.040]  where they don't even deny what they're planning, and oh, yeah, they think you're so dumb, folks.
[22:40.040 --> 22:42.400]  This is all right out in the open.
[22:42.400 --> 22:47.320]  That's how dumb they think you are.
[22:47.320 --> 22:51.280]  And then I told you they would put national guard on the streets in a few areas to get
[22:51.280 --> 22:53.240]  you trained seeing it on television.
[22:53.240 --> 23:00.040]  The Super Bowl, the Kentucky Derby, and then, oh my goodness, we're gonna put troops on
[23:00.040 --> 23:01.040]  the streets of Chicago.
[23:01.040 --> 23:04.480]  Now, three months ago, they announced they're gonna have police, quote, in riot gear, just
[23:04.480 --> 23:09.960]  patrol streets randomly, running random checkpoints, searching people to, quote, stop gun crime.
[23:09.960 --> 23:12.000]  The guns are doing it.
[23:12.000 --> 23:15.040]  One of the only places in the country where they have total gun bans, and it has the highest
[23:15.040 --> 23:19.360]  crime rate in the nation, next to D.C., another total gun ban area.
[23:19.360 --> 23:25.280]  Now they've got troops on the streets in England, and metal detectors outside, because they
[23:25.280 --> 23:28.040]  took the guns eight years ago, and the crime rate exploded.
[23:28.040 --> 23:29.040]  Same thing.
[23:29.040 --> 23:33.360]  They know, the social engineers know, they take your guns, crime explodes, they don't
[23:33.360 --> 23:38.560]  really fight the crime, and then say, oh, the answer is door-to-door gun confiscation
[23:38.560 --> 23:46.680]  using the national guard, because five gangbangers shot themselves in fights this week.
[23:46.680 --> 23:51.240]  They always call them children when under the 18 gangbangers, some 17-year-old guys
[23:51.240 --> 23:54.520]  killed four people and been in prison three times, get shot.
[23:54.520 --> 24:00.560]  They say, oh, a child died in Chicago, we've got to take your guns.
[24:00.560 --> 24:05.000]  And Mayor Daley, the son of the mob boss, well, of course, the mob wants your guns,
[24:05.000 --> 24:10.400]  and that's what tyranny is, is when criminality takes over government, then you get tyranny,
[24:10.400 --> 24:13.720]  and the criminals are in control.
[24:13.720 --> 24:20.160]  Now I remember 10 years ago learning that they were hiring felons in the U.S. military
[24:20.160 --> 24:23.600]  and police forces and sheriff's departments everywhere, and I told everyone and you didn't
[24:23.600 --> 24:24.600]  believe me.
[24:24.600 --> 24:26.280]  Then I got secret documents.
[24:26.280 --> 24:28.480]  Then I got declassified documents.
[24:28.480 --> 24:32.600]  Then for the last seven years or so, and you can Google this anytime, it's hundreds of
[24:32.600 --> 24:39.400]  mainstream articles, they write articles telling you how good it is to hire aggravated felons.
[24:39.400 --> 24:42.720]  And they say, oh, the Army wants aggravated felons.
[24:42.720 --> 24:44.240]  You know what an aggravated felon is?
[24:44.240 --> 24:48.000]  Well, the Associated Press and Washington Times, they all, in articles, told you.
[24:48.000 --> 24:55.040]  They said rape, arson, armed robbery, and it said they're hiring them.
[24:55.040 --> 24:57.480]  Large numbers of them.
[24:57.480 --> 25:02.360]  Now if that's not enough, they said what they really see count is aggravated felons who
[25:02.360 --> 25:06.080]  are illegal aliens on top of it, foreigners who are criminals.
[25:06.080 --> 25:11.160]  Now Stalin only hired criminals out of jails to carry out his operations because he knew
[25:11.160 --> 25:14.160]  they were criminals and would rape and rob and steal.
[25:14.160 --> 25:17.680]  He didn't hire foreigners who were criminals.
[25:17.680 --> 25:22.360]  Now other countries, the Soviets would use foreigners from one satellite country to go
[25:22.360 --> 25:23.360]  into another.
[25:23.360 --> 25:26.440]  So they also did that, but separately, not felons who were foreigners.
[25:26.440 --> 25:28.680]  It was felons and foreigners.
[25:28.680 --> 25:37.280]  Here in America, we use felon, aggravated felon, foreigners.
[25:37.280 --> 25:38.920]  And this needs to be discussed.
[25:38.920 --> 25:40.000]  This needs to be addressed.
[25:40.000 --> 25:43.380]  This needs to be talked about in other talk shows and in the newspaper.
[25:43.380 --> 25:44.380]  But it isn't.
[25:44.380 --> 25:47.960]  You'll just see an occasional blurb saying, oh, it's a wonderful thing.
[25:47.960 --> 25:48.960]  It's good.
[25:48.960 --> 25:51.800]  Now, I don't want you to think Barack Obama started this.
[25:51.800 --> 25:56.960]  I don't want to obsess too much on Barack Obama who runs absolutely nothing.
[25:56.960 --> 25:57.960]  Who's a total puppet.
[25:57.960 --> 26:00.280]  It doesn't matter if it's John McCain or Barack Obama.
[26:00.280 --> 26:06.320]  These Republican and Democratic National Conventions, this is all just theater for you to think
[26:06.320 --> 26:08.960]  they run something, okay?
[26:08.960 --> 26:10.560]  That's all it is.
[26:10.560 --> 26:15.880]  And something for pollsters and advertisement agencies to make money.
[26:15.880 --> 26:17.400]  It is a complete spectacle.
[26:17.400 --> 26:22.360]  It's like a vestigial claw on the elbow of a dog, okay?
[26:22.360 --> 26:25.500]  It isn't in use anymore.
[26:25.500 --> 26:27.720]  You got me?
[26:27.720 --> 26:34.200]  It isn't in use anymore.
[26:34.200 --> 26:38.840]  And the Chicago Tribune also reported, and then we went and found the audio tape.
[26:38.840 --> 26:44.040]  We have time to play it later, but it's on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[26:44.040 --> 26:47.160]  Obama calls for National Civilian Stasi.
[26:47.160 --> 26:51.560]  Now, remember, Clinton first set this up, Bush expanded it.
[26:51.560 --> 26:55.000]  It's called Secure Corps, giving you the name now.
[26:55.000 --> 27:00.440]  It's a division of AmeriCorps, and you can read where sixth, seventh, and eighth graders
[27:00.440 --> 27:05.840]  are trained with M16s on how to do warrant service, run checkpoints, aid the police and
[27:05.840 --> 27:06.840]  martial law.
[27:06.840 --> 27:10.600]  This is when the Philadelphia Daily News was the first place I saw that in 2002, the Secure
[27:10.600 --> 27:11.600]  Corps.
[27:11.600 --> 27:12.600]  Yes.
[27:12.600 --> 27:15.400]  Philadelphia Daily News, Secure Corps, Lexis, NEXIS, and media.
[27:15.400 --> 27:19.840]  Got people listening in Chicago, where we're on, or Kansas City, or upstate New York, or
[27:19.840 --> 27:21.920]  Austin, Texas, or San Diego.
[27:21.920 --> 27:22.920]  Don't roll your eyes.
[27:22.920 --> 27:25.520]  I'm going to give you the terms.
[27:25.520 --> 27:33.600]  Secure Corps Philadelphia Daily News, and it said warrant service, checkpoints, aiding
[27:33.600 --> 27:37.080]  in civil emergencies.
[27:37.080 --> 27:40.320]  Well, Obama is just announcing what's already been set up.
[27:40.320 --> 27:41.960]  I'm not defending him, either.
[27:41.960 --> 27:45.040]  He's a totally evil puppet, runs nothing.
[27:45.040 --> 27:49.520]  The point is, is that this is what they're proposing, and the quote here is, civilian
[27:49.520 --> 27:53.080]  national security force to surveil the American people.
[27:53.080 --> 27:59.080]  Now, wait, they've already hired half a million truck drivers, 26,000 preachers, 23,000 executives.
[27:59.080 --> 28:00.680]  That's InfraGuard.
[28:00.680 --> 28:04.240]  The clergy response teams, I'm giving you keywords, Google, clergy response teams.
[28:04.240 --> 28:06.280]  Come on, it's homework time.
[28:06.280 --> 28:09.920]  I reported this, by the way, all before it was in the mainstream news.
[28:09.920 --> 28:12.560]  I told you your dollar would plunge years ago.
[28:12.560 --> 28:14.520]  I told you the stock market would plunge.
[28:14.520 --> 28:16.000]  I told you why it would happen.
[28:16.000 --> 28:19.480]  I told you two years ago you'd be paying $4 a gallon this summer.
[28:19.480 --> 28:21.240]  I didn't just say $4 soon.
[28:21.240 --> 28:24.720]  I said, two summers from now.
[28:24.720 --> 28:25.720]  You know why?

[31:03.400 --> 31:07.800]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world

[32:58.520 --> 33:12.720]  All right, we are back live on the 20th of July, 2008.
[33:12.720 --> 33:19.840]  Obama calls for national civilian stasi, presidential candidate, wants domestic security forces
[33:19.840 --> 33:26.600]  as powerful as U.S. military, columnist compares proposal to Hitler Youth, that's the Knoxville
[33:26.600 --> 33:32.040]  News paper said that, presidential front runner, Barack Obama, has called for a civilian national
[33:32.040 --> 33:38.080]  security force as powerful as the U.S. military, comments that were ignored by the vast majority
[33:38.080 --> 33:45.080]  of the corporate media, but compared by one journalist, to the Nazi Hitler Youth.
[33:45.080 --> 33:48.280]  We cannot continue to rely on our military in order to achieve the national security
[33:48.280 --> 33:49.280]  objectives we've set.
[33:49.280 --> 33:53.920]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful and strong and
[33:53.920 --> 33:59.360]  just as well funded, Obama told the Colorado Springs audience earlier this month, now remember
[33:59.360 --> 34:03.320]  that whatever they announced is already in place, like they told you this year you have
[34:03.320 --> 34:08.160]  a national ID card near your driver's license, I told you that in 1997 in my film America
[34:08.160 --> 34:12.200]  Destroyed by Design, and I showed you all the executive orders and documents and how
[34:12.200 --> 34:16.480]  you were thumb scanning to get driver's license, and I told you in that film they would have
[34:16.480 --> 34:22.360]  police with thumb scanners and finger scanners in their cars and license plate reading cameras,
[34:22.360 --> 34:25.560]  and by the way that's all in the mainstream news today, they're now telling you the slaves
[34:25.560 --> 34:30.440]  about it a decade after it was in place.
[34:30.440 --> 34:31.440]  You see how that works?
[34:31.440 --> 34:37.640]  No, you don't have a national ID card, you have a world standardized ID card under a
[34:37.640 --> 34:44.040]  September 2000 United Nations Treaty that was ratified in our country signed on World
[34:44.040 --> 34:48.680]  ID specifications in Australia.
[34:48.680 --> 34:54.040]  You have a world ID, your driver's license is just has a local kind of like sports illustrated
[34:54.040 --> 34:58.360]  has 10 different you know regional variants or whatever.
[34:58.360 --> 35:02.080]  Same thing, you think you got a Texas driver's license or an Illinois driver's license or
[35:02.080 --> 35:07.080]  a New York driver's license or you think you got a Toronto driver's license, no, you have
[35:07.080 --> 35:10.280]  a world ID.
[35:10.280 --> 35:14.200]  And by the way the Ministry of Defense 100 plus page document put out by the British
[35:14.200 --> 35:18.040]  last year where they say this is what we believe is going to happen and what we're doing says
[35:18.040 --> 35:24.800]  our governments will use neutron bombs on us if we try to ever stop their new world order.
[35:24.800 --> 35:31.000]  Yeah, Dick Cheney wrote they'll use bio weapons on us in the September 2000 building America's
[35:31.000 --> 35:34.480]  defenses document put out by PNAC authored by him.
[35:34.480 --> 35:39.960]  See they know you don't read think tank documents, they know you don't read the Ministry of Defense
[35:39.960 --> 35:45.800]  10 year plan.
[35:45.800 --> 35:49.520]  Just Google that will come up in that 2007 to get that year.
[35:49.520 --> 35:53.120]  You can have the whole hundred and something page declassified version and it says yes,
[35:53.120 --> 35:56.080]  our governments will use neutron bombs on the people.
[35:56.080 --> 36:00.920]  Your government is owned by private families, they have weapons that they could detonate
[36:00.920 --> 36:08.000]  above Austin, Texas and kill every bug, every dog, every cat and you every squirrel.
[36:08.000 --> 36:12.640]  I don't care if you're 100 feet under the ground, you will flop around for about 10
[36:12.640 --> 36:14.140]  seconds and die.
[36:14.140 --> 36:18.920]  Just if you're underground, there's enough radiation coming in, an instant flash and
[36:18.920 --> 36:23.160]  then they roll in.
[36:23.160 --> 36:26.320]  You don't understand do you what we're dealing with here.
[36:26.320 --> 36:28.520]  You don't understand who these people are.
[36:28.520 --> 36:33.240]  You see because I'm so on and so targeted and know what they're doing is the only reason
[36:33.240 --> 36:38.200]  I'm not dead or set up or imprisoned because they don't want to underline and highlight
[36:38.200 --> 36:41.920]  everything I'm saying, they don't want to put an exclamation point and a bullhorn to
[36:41.920 --> 36:44.440]  everything I'm saying, killing me would do that.
[36:44.440 --> 36:47.560]  Everybody asked if this was true, why are you alive if they're such killers?
[36:47.560 --> 36:51.640]  Because I've already said it all, I've already put it out.
[36:51.640 --> 36:53.480]  You understand?
[36:53.480 --> 36:58.160]  And because this only a couple thousand people through compartmentalization control this
[36:58.160 --> 37:05.040]  through the shadow government, through the national security state.
[37:05.040 --> 37:08.960]  They bring in the cocaine, they bring in the heroin, they own the drug companies that push
[37:08.960 --> 37:14.160]  Ritalin and Prozac on your children and HPV live cancer virus shots where on the insert
[37:14.160 --> 37:18.120]  for the shot it admits it doesn't protect you from cancer and will give you cancer,
[37:18.120 --> 37:19.680]  but you won't read that will you?
[37:19.680 --> 37:23.960]  You are naive.
[37:23.960 --> 37:28.480]  Stop being naive.
[37:28.480 --> 37:32.920]  In my film, Road to Terrany, I talk about youth cores.
[37:32.920 --> 37:40.560]  In my film I made in 1999, police state 2000, I cover youth cores and show you the documents
[37:40.560 --> 37:46.040]  and say they are going to stage terror attacks and then implement youth cores running around
[37:46.040 --> 37:48.040]  and spying on people.
[37:48.040 --> 37:52.360]  And in every city they have quote FBI anti-terror meetings, they invite the public and people
[37:52.360 --> 37:56.080]  who mean well show up and they go okay, it's a seven day free course, you'll get coffee
[37:56.080 --> 37:59.360]  and donuts while you're here, it's a couple of hours every night and then they have one
[37:59.360 --> 38:03.640]  day on terrorism and then the rest is your neighbor growing marijuana, do they spank
[38:03.640 --> 38:10.960]  their kids, it's all about police state.
[38:10.960 --> 38:15.840]  I told you more than 10 years ago in 1996 because I read the telecommunications act
[38:15.840 --> 38:19.680]  that your cell phone would track you down to just a few feet off a triangulation with
[38:19.680 --> 38:25.480]  the cell towers and a GPS map and then now it's been announced to you in the last two
[38:25.480 --> 38:29.080]  years, tracking you, tracing you.
[38:29.080 --> 38:38.200]  I told you everything, do you understand because I read what Rand Corporation says, I read
[38:38.200 --> 38:45.880]  what MIT says, MIT said 20 years ago their main directive larger than the Manhattan
[38:45.880 --> 38:56.640]  project just MIT alone was to build a military control grid and use the US as a test and
[38:56.640 --> 39:04.040]  England as a test to then put in dominated countries and then MIT magazine in a 2006
[39:04.040 --> 39:11.720]  issue, I was at a grill waiting at the bar to get food to take home to my family, I
[39:11.720 --> 39:14.840]  can't even get away from this stuff and there was MIT magazine laying there, I already knew
[39:14.840 --> 39:22.160]  all about it, it was at Cypress Grill in South Austin and I pick up MIT magazine a few months
[39:22.160 --> 39:29.240]  ago and I flip it open and it's them bragging about the military grid with cameras and surveillance
[39:29.240 --> 39:35.680]  they put it in Iraq and how that was a system developed here, this is a military run grid,
[39:35.680 --> 39:40.920]  do you read me, you don't mean anything to those running it and Henry Kissinger calls
[39:40.920 --> 39:45.320]  the military dumb animals to be used, calls the police dumb animals, they think you're
[39:45.320 --> 39:51.560]  dumb animals and in a way you are, I mean they openly test chemicals and biologicals
[39:51.560 --> 39:55.560]  on you, they openly use you, they're not giving you your healthcare or the GI bills
[39:55.560 --> 40:01.760]  being taken away now, they're taking, people had jobs at GM for 35 years are being told
[40:01.760 --> 40:06.080]  no healthcare anymore, we're not giving you your pensions, I told you that would happen
[40:06.080 --> 40:09.520]  and this is only the beginning and if you don't like it, they're going to send the
[40:09.520 --> 40:14.120]  young 20 year old guys that don't know what they're doing to go after the old guys who
[40:14.120 --> 40:22.920]  were in the military decades ago, if you want to save the republic, if you want to save
[40:22.920 --> 40:27.400]  this country, you've got to admit we're going into tyranny, you know the Germans didn't
[40:27.400 --> 40:31.440]  believe what was happening to them, Americans into the mid 40s didn't believe there were
[40:31.440 --> 40:35.960]  camps or mass executions or tyranny, no one believed the Soviets were killing people,
[40:35.960 --> 40:41.040]  they killed 50 million, Mao, the government of China admits killed 60 million, the real
[40:41.040 --> 40:50.160]  number is about 80 million and I've interviewed former top White House historians and CIA
[40:50.160 --> 40:55.040]  briefers, Richard C. Cook, Ray McGovern, a whole bunch of them in the last two weeks
[40:55.040 --> 41:00.160]  and they are all independently saying they believe a massive extermination purge is
[41:00.160 --> 41:05.200]  being set up and geared up in the US and England and they said they believe the elites want
[41:05.200 --> 41:09.840]  to have a mass culling to get completely rid of the middle class, you know it's declassified,
[41:09.840 --> 41:13.440]  this is a big New Brzezinski and he even wrote about it in one of his books, National Security
[41:13.440 --> 41:21.840]  Advisor to Jimmy Carter, the guy that's behind Barack Obama, he got Kissinger, his commander
[41:21.840 --> 41:28.760]  above McCain, you know he wrote and said yeah we worked with the Khmer Rouge, we liked
[41:28.760 --> 41:34.880]  the Khmer Rouge who killed at least 2 million Christian middle class people, you had a pair
[41:34.880 --> 41:41.280]  of glasses, they killed you because that meant you had money and could read, they won a bunch
[41:41.280 --> 41:47.480]  of dumb peasants, nothing against the peasants but that's what they want, dumb down, not
[41:47.480 --> 41:51.040]  having any education, not knowing any better, that's why they're overrunning the US with
[41:51.040 --> 41:56.720]  third world people to drive down wages, now we get back, I want to give you some background
[41:56.720 --> 42:02.000]  in 2002 Rocky Mountain Daily News, I want media to Lexus Nexus this, if you're too stupid

[42:25.680 --> 42:31.440]  camps in Georgia, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
[42:31.440 --> 42:36.480]  and hundreds of thousands of plastic coffins stacked, we got the company's name and sold
[42:36.480 --> 42:42.400]  it to them, everything, that's right, are you just going to go along with this and you're

[45:01.880 --> 45:06.440]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which

[45:56.920 --> 45:58.880]  energy and vibrant health?
[45:58.880 --> 46:04.040]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.

[47:09.400 --> 47:19.800]  There is hope, my friends, but we have to admit how serious things have gotten.
[47:19.800 --> 47:21.640]  We can't be in denial about this.
[47:21.640 --> 47:26.840]  I mean, here they are calmly reporting, oh, an Illinois National Guard is going to go
[47:26.840 --> 47:29.960]  door-to-door confiscating guns.
[47:29.960 --> 47:34.080]  People can rationalize New Orleans and surrounding towns that go into high and dry areas.
[47:34.080 --> 47:39.000]  The army, regular army, would march in with the police and confiscate guns.
[47:39.000 --> 47:43.880]  The police came out and said, we're confiscating all the guns and people who are still in denial.
[47:43.880 --> 47:51.960]  Well now in Oakland, California and Tucson, Arizona, Dallas, Texas, Boston, Massachusetts,
[47:51.960 --> 47:55.600]  everywhere, Washington, D.C., they're having knock-and-talk where they just come to your
[47:55.600 --> 47:59.920]  door and started in Tucson.
[47:59.920 --> 48:04.000]  It actually started in pro-gun areas like Arizona and Texas and Dallas.
[48:04.000 --> 48:08.280]  I saw the Dallas Marine News like four years ago and it described middle-class areas and
[48:08.280 --> 48:10.480]  they come during the day when they think the husbands aren't there.
[48:10.480 --> 48:12.160]  It's totally criminal.
[48:12.160 --> 48:15.160]  It's called knock-and-talk and they knock and don't deny it.
[48:15.160 --> 48:16.720]  Folks, go Google it.
[48:16.720 --> 48:18.880]  Don't just say I'm making this up.
[48:18.880 --> 48:20.440]  The country dies if you do that.
[48:20.440 --> 48:21.520]  You understand?
[48:21.520 --> 48:24.600]  They go to the door and they say, we'd like to look and see if your guns are legal.
[48:24.600 --> 48:26.040]  We're just here randomly.
[48:26.040 --> 48:31.240]  No due process, no probable cause.
[48:31.240 --> 48:35.560]  It's a federal grant to come and ask about your guns and they have the gun buyback programs
[48:35.560 --> 48:40.920]  which gives people the image of folks lined up handing guns in for money.
[48:40.920 --> 48:41.920]  All to condition you.
[48:41.920 --> 48:44.640]  They did the same thing in Australia and England before they banned guns.
[48:44.640 --> 48:45.640]  Same thing in Canada.
[48:45.640 --> 48:50.080]  They banned half of what they registered there.
[48:50.080 --> 48:54.760]  Totally banned guns in places like England and the crime rates, of course, explode.
[48:54.760 --> 49:02.800]  But yeah, Obama wants one million teenagers with guns in uniforms spying and fighting the
[49:02.800 --> 49:06.000]  terrorists that are hiding under every cupboard.
[49:06.000 --> 49:09.120]  The news is telling you for like six months now, and I told you they'd say this because
[49:09.120 --> 49:13.800]  we got documents on it a year ago, there's blonde-haired blue-eyed al-Qaeda, al-Qaeda
[49:13.800 --> 49:14.800]  is everywhere.
[49:14.800 --> 49:19.160]  Remember we said first they'll train you that it's Muslim al-Qaeda, which doesn't exist
[49:19.160 --> 49:20.160]  either.
[49:20.160 --> 49:24.320]  Then they would move on to actually everybody's al-Qaeda.
[49:24.320 --> 49:27.360]  Black people, white people, they're all al-Qaeda.
[49:27.360 --> 49:32.400]  Then now I've had national talk show host and Congress and others say that I am al-Qaeda.
[49:32.400 --> 49:33.400]  What else?
[49:33.400 --> 49:34.400]  Jones, he's al-Qaeda.
[49:34.400 --> 49:40.440]  Oh, did al-Qaeda write the PNAC documents where they said they'd use bio weapons on us and
[49:40.440 --> 49:41.440]  kill us?
[49:41.440 --> 49:42.440]  Our government did.
[49:42.440 --> 49:46.360]  By the way, there's all these thousands of admitted examples where the criminals that
[49:46.360 --> 49:50.200]  run our government from the 40s right through to the last stuff declassified in the 80s,
[49:50.200 --> 49:52.320]  and it's still going on.
[49:52.320 --> 49:56.720]  They declassify things every 20-something years, so we're in the mid-90s now.
[49:56.720 --> 49:59.480]  I mean mid-80s now, excuse me.
[49:59.480 --> 50:03.640]  And they just came right out and say that they've tested lethal chemical, biological,
[50:03.640 --> 50:09.520]  radiologicals in every major city of the U.S., killing people in many of the cases.
[50:09.520 --> 50:15.600]  Just type U.S. groups killed by nerve gas or New York Subways sprayed by biological weapon.
[50:15.600 --> 50:18.840]  And you'll read it and go, wait a minute, the government says give up all my rights.
[50:18.840 --> 50:22.720]  There's these people that want to nerve gas me or use chemical or biologicals.
[50:22.720 --> 50:25.160]  And by the way, there's a lot of weak-minded people out there going, wait a minute, I never
[50:25.160 --> 50:26.160]  heard about that.
[50:26.160 --> 50:27.560]  Well, you must be hiding under a rock.
[50:27.560 --> 50:30.800]  I mean, everybody knows there's been chemical, biological, radiological testing.
[50:30.800 --> 50:32.960]  Let me ask both the guys running the show.
[50:32.960 --> 50:37.720]  Before you ever heard of my radio show or ever did stuff, Paul and Trey, did you ever
[50:37.720 --> 50:43.080]  see on the news I want to see or hear them talk about chemical, biological, radiological
[50:43.080 --> 50:46.680]  testing on the U.S. population?
[50:46.680 --> 50:48.680]  Tuskegee experiments.
[50:48.680 --> 50:52.120]  But I mean, you hadn't heard about the other stuff where they sprayed biologicals on cities?
[50:52.120 --> 50:55.400]  I mean, I was just starting with this, the easiest, but I mean, how much had you heard
[50:55.400 --> 50:56.600]  of before you ever heard of me?
[50:56.600 --> 50:57.600]  Oh, sure.
[50:57.600 --> 51:00.920]  I mean, I've talked to people who have heard of the, you know, all the cloud seeding and
[51:00.920 --> 51:02.600]  chemical spraying they've been doing for years.
[51:02.600 --> 51:05.600]  I mean, I know people who've heard about it, who are twice my age.
[51:05.600 --> 51:06.600]  What about you, Paul?
[51:06.600 --> 51:07.600]  What about you?
[51:07.600 --> 51:08.600]  So you had never heard.
[51:08.600 --> 51:09.600]  See?
[51:09.600 --> 51:13.360]  Well, for those that don't know, you can go to the Department of Energy, like I said earlier,
[51:13.360 --> 51:15.920]  and they'll tell you how they murdered thousands of U.S. children.
[51:15.920 --> 51:19.120]  They take them from poor families, walk them in and radiate them to death.
[51:19.120 --> 51:22.320]  Now, that was really to create cod rays of killers in the government.
[51:22.320 --> 51:23.640]  It wasn't about testing radiation.
[51:23.640 --> 51:27.800]  It was about seeing what they could get away with.
[51:27.800 --> 51:33.800]  Now, if you don't know about this listeners, you need to go find out and then understand.
[51:33.800 --> 51:35.720]  Now you know why they'll do these type of things.
[51:35.720 --> 51:37.320]  They're totally ruthless.
[51:37.320 --> 51:39.360]  They believe the end justifies the means.
[51:39.360 --> 51:47.320]  And now they want to have a million to start with youth running around spying and tattling
[51:47.320 --> 51:48.320]  on you.
[51:48.320 --> 51:53.600]  They have felons and illegal aliens filling the police force, filling the military force,
[51:53.600 --> 51:55.880]  all the mainstream news articles on that.
[51:55.880 --> 52:00.160]  Just Google it and you'll have just scores of mainstream news, just type.
[52:00.160 --> 52:05.760]  Police departments hiring, they'll use the politically correct word, immigrants.
[52:05.760 --> 52:12.360]  Police forces, but one headline, one AP headline in New Mexico did say illegal immigrants.
[52:12.360 --> 52:15.080]  You can just pull it up for yourself, ladies and gentlemen, right now.
[52:15.080 --> 52:16.080]  Don't deny.
[52:16.080 --> 52:20.360]  And if you didn't know history, they hire foreigners and felons because they'll follow
[52:20.360 --> 52:22.360]  illegal tyrannical orders.
[52:22.360 --> 52:26.880]  Now Hitler, Stalin, they all did it, okay?
[52:26.880 --> 52:31.720]  They also hire Eugen, young forces, Mao did it.
[52:31.720 --> 52:36.960]  You notice that Al Gore, who was just here in town, he's getting 10 million youth brigades
[52:36.960 --> 52:43.760]  and they're all over the place, slicing the SUV tires all over the country, egging SUVs.
[52:43.760 --> 52:45.720]  They're already, the police don't investigate it.
[52:45.720 --> 52:49.280]  The news won't report on it, but here and there, burning down ski resorts, burning down
[52:49.280 --> 52:50.280]  homes.
[52:50.280 --> 52:53.160]  That's the type of brigades that Al Gore is recruiting.
[52:53.160 --> 52:57.840]  Oh yeah, you didn't know about the environmental terrorist out there?
[52:57.840 --> 52:59.880]  There to be turned loose against the middle class.
[52:59.880 --> 53:06.280]  They're all going to be the new officers to regulate and control your carbon footprint,
[53:06.280 --> 53:08.480]  to control your daily life.
[53:08.480 --> 53:09.760]  Paul's in there shaking his head.
[53:09.760 --> 53:12.600]  Paul, I can Google it right now.
[53:12.600 --> 53:14.440]  I'm serious.
[53:14.440 --> 53:15.520]  This is what they're doing.
[53:15.520 --> 53:18.400]  This is who they're hiring.
[53:18.400 --> 53:21.600]  Now let's go ahead and get into these coffins.
[53:21.600 --> 53:27.720]  If you go to infowars.com right now, you can read this and see all the YouTube videos,
[53:27.720 --> 53:35.720]  and you can go to the company website that, if it's not the same company, it's this company
[53:35.720 --> 53:40.640]  or just licensed it from them because it is the, and we're not saying they're a bad company
[53:40.640 --> 53:45.960]  for selling mass grave coffins.
[53:45.960 --> 53:48.840]  That's just the fact that we're reporting on that.
[53:48.840 --> 53:49.840]  So let me be clear.
[53:49.840 --> 53:50.840]  The company isn't bad.
[53:50.840 --> 53:53.920]  They're allowed to be in business and sell this to the government.
[53:53.920 --> 54:02.280]  In the past, we would see articles about 1 million body bags ordered by FEMA or 300,000
[54:02.280 --> 54:04.720]  plastic coffins ordered by Homeland Security.
[54:04.720 --> 54:06.520]  I mean, we've had all those articles.
[54:06.520 --> 54:10.520]  We just have never, but people don't care about an article or a news story.
[54:10.520 --> 54:11.880]  They want to see the coffins.
[54:11.880 --> 54:20.280]  So some folks in Georgia saw one of these facilities, and we've got Google photos of
[54:20.280 --> 54:28.080]  it and ground photos and video of it, and it is more than 500,000 of these giant coffins
[54:28.080 --> 54:29.680]  stacked outside.
[54:29.680 --> 54:35.720]  You'll have big stacks of lids and then stacks of the coffins, one inside the other.
[54:35.720 --> 54:44.160]  And they also have other systems that you can go read about.
[54:44.160 --> 54:53.280]  They also have urns for your cremated body, and this is in Georgia.
[54:53.280 --> 54:57.480]  The company is Polygard Vaults, but they're in Alabama.
[54:57.480 --> 55:03.040]  This is a separate area, FEMA least area, just sitting right out by the side of a highway
[55:03.040 --> 55:08.000]  for the last couple of years, and finally, we've mentioned this before, but finally,
[55:08.000 --> 55:12.480]  this is really getting big news on the web, and big reports being done by Kurt Nemo right
[55:12.480 --> 55:13.480]  now.
[55:13.480 --> 55:14.480]  In fact, it may be up.
[55:14.480 --> 55:17.760]  I know he's working on it to have it up by the end of the show.
[55:17.760 --> 55:23.760]  Why are tens of thousands of plastic burial vaults stacked in a field near Madison, Georgia
[55:23.760 --> 55:29.200]  is the headline, Polygard Vaults, and you go to their website, and we also have photos
[55:29.200 --> 55:38.640]  of the trucks, giant 18-wheelers, huge 18-wheelers with these extra long flat beds just totally
[55:38.640 --> 55:45.720]  stacked with the coffins that go one inside the other like plastic Dixie cups, and they're
[55:45.720 --> 55:47.400]  just all there.
[55:47.400 --> 55:49.640]  Now, we know this is FEMA.
[55:49.640 --> 55:53.000]  We know that these are coffins.
[55:53.000 --> 55:57.440]  Some people are debating that because we have all the news articles where it says FEMA's
[55:57.440 --> 56:00.520]  ordered coffins and body bags by the millions.
[56:00.520 --> 56:06.000]  This is just one stockpile just a few miles away from the Atlanta airport, which is the
[56:06.000 --> 56:11.040]  largest airport in the United States.
[56:11.040 --> 56:14.600]  So you can go there and look at these.
[56:14.600 --> 56:19.800]  Now FEMA and the CDC say that they're, by the way, this is nearby the CDC Center for
[56:19.800 --> 56:25.200]  Disease Control, they say that they're only doing this in case there's a mass biological
[56:25.200 --> 56:26.200]  outbreak.
[56:26.200 --> 56:30.120]  You've just got to remember that it's the government, the criminals that have hijacked
[56:30.120 --> 56:34.720]  our government, their National Security Act of 47, who fully took over when they killed
[56:34.720 --> 56:41.360]  President Kennedy in 63, and now under PDD 51 openly says that the White House is a dictatorship
[56:41.360 --> 56:43.920]  and that Congress has no authority.
[56:43.920 --> 56:47.680]  The chairman of the Homeland Security Department for six, seven months, it's been going on
[56:47.680 --> 56:51.560]  for 11 months total since one of the people on the committee asked to see the documents.
[56:51.560 --> 56:57.000]  They're not even allowed to see the fully declassified slash classified version.
[56:57.000 --> 57:02.680]  But on the cover sheet of PDD 51, Presidential Decision Directive 51, it says that the president
[57:02.680 --> 57:05.240]  is a dictator.
[57:05.240 --> 57:08.600]  People say, well, everything will be all right, Barack Obama will soon be in, or John
[57:08.600 --> 57:09.680]  McCain will.
[57:09.680 --> 57:11.360]  They're just puppets.
[57:11.360 --> 57:13.520]  They run nothing.
[57:13.520 --> 57:16.520]  They're there to carry out their orders, understand?
[57:16.520 --> 57:20.440]  It's that executive branch that allows the private corporations that have hijacked our
[57:20.440 --> 57:24.920]  government to have at least on the surface the look of government.
[57:24.920 --> 57:28.440]  But a president declaring himself dictator is totally illegal and illegitimate.
[57:28.440 --> 57:30.160]  See, that's what you've got to ask yourself.
[57:30.160 --> 57:34.200]  Do you stand with the Bill of Rights of Constitution or with the New World Order?
[57:34.200 --> 57:38.040]  Do you stand with the Republic and the founding fathers or the dirtbag globalist?
[57:38.040 --> 57:41.440]  We'll be right back with a second hour and your calls.
[57:41.440 --> 57:43.080]  More on the topic.

[58:20.160 --> 58:26.560]  This low-mintage collector coin, with a total-series-mintage under $600,000, has sold at four times
[58:26.560 --> 58:27.720]  its current price.

[58:43.200 --> 58:45.640]  Oh, what a beautiful day for the beach.
[58:45.640 --> 58:50.040]  Look, up there in the sky, it's non-X-man.
[58:50.040 --> 58:51.720]  He's in a dive.
[58:51.720 --> 58:54.360]  He must have found some ugly toenails on the beach.
[58:54.360 --> 58:55.360]  Let's go look.
[58:55.360 --> 58:59.480]  I'm non-X-man, and your toenails need non-X nail gel.
[58:59.480 --> 59:01.280]  Stop hiding them in the sand.
[59:01.280 --> 59:02.280]  Take them out.
[59:02.280 --> 59:03.280]  Let's see them.
[59:03.280 --> 59:07.680]  Oh, I'm so embarrassed.
[59:07.680 --> 59:08.680]  Don't worry.
[59:08.680 --> 59:10.480]  Now there's non-X nail gel.
[59:10.480 --> 59:14.880]  Use it on your toenails regularly, and they'll look fantastic in sandals.
[59:14.880 --> 59:17.640]  Oh, I will, non-X-man.
[59:17.640 --> 59:18.640]  Great.
[59:18.640 --> 59:22.400]  Well, I'm off to find more ugly toenails.
[59:22.400 --> 59:26.800]  Don't let non-X-man find you with unsightly toenails.
[59:26.800 --> 59:30.800]  Buy diabetic-friendly, money-back-guaranteed non-X nail gel.
[59:30.800 --> 59:37.320]  It's in the foot care aisle at Supercenters, Walgreens, CVS, Lawns, Meyer, Giant Eagle,
[59:37.320 --> 59:42.760]  Card Drug, Sniders, Dwayne Reed, Bylo, and Rite Aid.
[59:42.760 --> 59:51.080]  And some Texans who are facing foreclosure are responding with, you're listening to GCN.
[59:51.080 --> 59:53.840]  Texas, it's five o'clock.
[59:53.840 --> 59:57.760]  I'm Chote Jordan.
[59:57.760 --> 1:00:01.680]  Barack Obama has been meeting today with Afghanistan's president.
[1:00:01.680 --> 1:00:06.960]  An Afghan official says the Democratic presidential candidate pledged steadfast aid to Afghanistan
[1:00:06.960 --> 1:00:11.600]  and vowed to pursue the war on terror with vigor if he is elected.
[1:00:11.600 --> 1:00:14.760]  Obama also had breakfast with the troops today in Kabul.
[1:00:14.760 --> 1:00:15.760]  Breakfast with the troops.
[1:00:15.760 --> 1:00:16.760]  What's it like?
[1:00:16.760 --> 1:00:20.600]  The food is excellent, but the company's even better.
[1:00:20.600 --> 1:00:25.360]  And Tropical Storm Cristobal has gained a little strength as it makes its slow way along
[1:00:25.360 --> 1:00:27.480]  the North Carolina coast.
[1:00:27.480 --> 1:00:31.800]  It's expected to dump several inches of rain in parts of the drowned stricken state.
[1:00:31.800 --> 1:00:35.160]  Cristobal will likely skirt the outer banks today.
[1:00:35.160 --> 1:00:37.520]  Here's weather bug meteorologist Steve Prinze Valley.
[1:00:37.520 --> 1:00:43.040]  As of 5 a.m., Cristobal was just about 60 miles southwest of Cape Lookout, North Carolina
[1:00:43.040 --> 1:00:47.600]  and about 130 miles southwest of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.
[1:00:47.600 --> 1:00:51.160]  This is IRN USA Radio News.
[1:00:51.160 --> 1:00:55.960]  psoriasis, the itching, flaking, and irritation is painful, but the emotional suffering can
[1:00:55.960 --> 1:00:57.440]  be even more devastating.
[1:00:57.440 --> 1:01:00.960]  My body was so sore, my mind was so worn out, I could not sleep at night.
[1:01:00.960 --> 1:01:03.560]  I felt self-conscious, nobody knows what that flaking is.
[1:01:03.560 --> 1:01:06.040]  And people say, ew, it just made me feel like you're dirty.
[1:01:06.040 --> 1:01:07.640]  I don't know what people know when I have this, it's embarrassing.
[1:01:07.640 --> 1:01:10.440]  Of course I felt self-conscious, not very attractive to look at.
[1:01:10.440 --> 1:01:15.320]  The solution is new and improved Skin Zinc Advanced, the number one OTC treatment for
[1:01:15.320 --> 1:01:16.320]  psoriasis.
[1:01:16.320 --> 1:01:18.240]  Skin Zinc turned out to be the perfect answer.
[1:01:18.240 --> 1:01:22.600]  Skin Zinc has changed my life the third day I saw that my psoriasis was disappearing,
[1:01:22.600 --> 1:01:23.600]  dude.
[1:01:23.600 --> 1:01:25.840]  One week I noticed that the rashes on my arms were going away.
[1:01:25.840 --> 1:01:27.920]  My elbows are completely cleared up.
[1:01:27.920 --> 1:01:28.920]  You have to try it.

[1:01:51.360 --> 1:01:55.840]  The Pentagon's top military officer says he worries about setting a timetable for withdrawing
[1:01:55.840 --> 1:01:58.040]  U.S. combat troops from Iraq.
[1:01:58.040 --> 1:02:02.400]  Admiral Mike Mullin says the consequences could be very dangerous for Iraq's stability
[1:02:02.400 --> 1:02:04.480]  if there was a fixed timetable.
[1:02:04.480 --> 1:02:09.000]  But in a broadcast interview today, the Joint Chief's Chairman says if conditions in Iraq
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:14.200]  keep improving, he believes he will be able to recommend further troop cuts in the fall.
[1:02:14.200 --> 1:02:18.160]  An Iraqi government spokesman says the German magazine did not quote Iraq's Prime Minister
[1:02:18.160 --> 1:02:19.520]  accurately.
[1:02:19.520 --> 1:02:24.040]  The article quoted Nouri al-Maliki as giving apparent backing to U.S. troop withdrawal
[1:02:24.040 --> 1:02:26.440]  plans discussed by Barack Obama.
[1:02:26.440 --> 1:02:30.560]  The spokesman says al-Maliki was discussing an Iraq vision of a troop pullout that did
[1:02:30.560 --> 1:02:33.560]  not endorse a specific timetable.
[1:02:33.560 --> 1:02:38.440]  In Beijing, it's launching its drastic pollution control plan in hopes of cleaning smog-choked
[1:02:38.440 --> 1:02:40.800]  skies and time for the Olympics.
[1:02:40.800 --> 1:02:45.840]  Chemical plants and power stations must cut emissions by 30 percent starting today.

[1:02:49.840 --> 1:02:52.840]  Hi, this is Dale Denton from Maryland.
[1:02:52.840 --> 1:02:56.480]  I came from a real estate background and a downturn put me out of business.
[1:02:56.480 --> 1:03:00.120]  I found myself near 50 and having to start over with no retirement plan.
[1:03:00.120 --> 1:03:03.680]  I've been working the three-step plan for just over two and a half years.
[1:03:03.680 --> 1:03:07.320]  The minimum investment compared to the return that I got was just awesome.
[1:03:07.320 --> 1:03:09.920]  The three-step plan has given me my life back.
[1:03:09.920 --> 1:03:11.480]  Hi, this is Andy Willoughby.

[1:03:21.520 --> 1:03:26.400]  The idea of a gas tax holiday this summer hit the brakes on Capitol Hill.
[1:03:26.400 --> 1:03:31.880]  Here's Bob Eller depriving the 52-year-old highway trust fund of $9 billion at a time
[1:03:31.880 --> 1:03:36.640]  when it's heading into the red, doomed the notion of a gas tax holiday in Congress.
[1:03:36.640 --> 1:03:40.600]  Three years ago, the trust fund enjoyed a surplus of $10 billion.
[1:03:40.600 --> 1:03:47.280]  Even without a tax freeze, the fund is projected to finish 2009 with a deficit of $3 billion.
[1:03:47.280 --> 1:03:52.920]  That could grow as Americans stung by higher pump prices drive less and buy less gas.
[1:03:52.920 --> 1:03:57.400]  But Farf is sticking to the script, declining to address his public rift with the Green
[1:03:57.400 --> 1:04:01.360]  Bay Packers in an appearance at Lambeau Field on Saturday.
[1:04:01.360 --> 1:04:05.880]  Farf called Green Bay a special place while praising former teammate Frank Winters in
[1:04:05.880 --> 1:04:10.440]  a news conference before the Packers' Hall of Fame induction ceremony banquet.
[1:04:10.440 --> 1:04:15.400]  Farf says it was nice to be named Packers' MVP for last season and says his teammates
[1:04:15.400 --> 1:04:16.840]  deserve a lot of praise.
[1:04:16.840 --> 1:04:21.280]  It was great that I was honored with this award tonight so it gave me a chance to thank
[1:04:21.280 --> 1:04:28.680]  William, Marco, and Chewie, and Gilbert, and Santana, and Frank.
[1:04:28.680 --> 1:04:34.760]  And rapper DMX has been arrested in Phoenix.
[1:04:34.760 --> 1:04:39.800]  Authorities say they suspect he gave a false name and a social security number to a hospital
[1:04:39.800 --> 1:04:42.840]  to get out of paying for medical expenses.
[1:04:42.840 --> 1:04:45.800]  It's his third arrest in the past month.
[1:04:45.800 --> 1:04:50.320]  I'm Jody Jordan, and that's news from the Information Radio Network.
[1:04:50.320 --> 1:04:55.360]  With oil at $105 per barrel and counting, we need radical change if we're to avert becoming
[1:04:55.360 --> 1:04:57.040]  a third world nation.
[1:04:57.040 --> 1:05:01.200]  It's time to jump on the next wave of free energy and radical natural alternative health
[1:05:01.200 --> 1:05:02.200]  solutions.
[1:05:02.200 --> 1:05:07.320]  Introducing Orgon Products, Orgon is the universal life force, the basic building block of all
[1:05:07.320 --> 1:05:09.360]  matter on the material planet.
[1:05:09.360 --> 1:05:13.880]  Orgon Electro Medicine is the wave of the future dating back to the late 1800s.
[1:05:13.880 --> 1:05:18.560]  Will Helmreich Orgon use cloudbuster technology that can now be applied in your home for dramatic
[1:05:18.560 --> 1:05:21.160]  energy savings of up to 25 percent?
[1:05:21.160 --> 1:05:25.160]  The possible uses for this device are only limited by your imagination.
[1:05:25.160 --> 1:05:28.800]  For less than the cost of a doctor's visit, you can have a device that could lead to the
[1:05:28.800 --> 1:05:30.720]  end of all your problems.

[1:06:07.400 --> 1:06:10.000]  He stands for what's right.
[1:06:10.000 --> 1:06:13.240]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[1:06:13.240 --> 1:06:21.520]  Call Alex now toll-free at 877-590-5525.
[1:06:21.520 --> 1:06:27.360]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[1:06:27.360 --> 1:06:33.280]  All right, as I said, wide open phones in the shower.
[1:06:33.280 --> 1:06:40.800]  I covered the fact they bought millions of body bags, just identified well over 500,000
[1:06:40.800 --> 1:06:46.400]  big plastic caskets out there by the airport in Georgia.
[1:06:46.400 --> 1:06:49.360]  FEMA admits it's built camps for the American people.
[1:06:49.360 --> 1:06:53.400]  The Rex-84 plan back in the 80s said they would build camps and put illegal aliens in
[1:06:53.400 --> 1:06:58.360]  them at first to sell the public on accepting them, but it was really for the general public,
[1:06:58.360 --> 1:07:03.120]  and then lo and behold, they're doing that all over the nation right now.
[1:07:03.120 --> 1:07:06.960]  The federal government wants to have youth brigades out on the streets, quote, finding
[1:07:06.960 --> 1:07:09.720]  the terrorists that are everywhere.
[1:07:09.720 --> 1:07:14.360]  And the biggest news is NBC News and the Chicago Tribune Report, the governor is going to put
[1:07:14.360 --> 1:07:19.660]  national guards on the streets going door-to-door confiscating guns in Illinois, and no one
[1:07:19.660 --> 1:07:22.000]  covers it, not the Second Amendment groups.
[1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:27.400]  No one, kind of like nobody when they were on television saying, everyone will be disarmed.
[1:07:27.400 --> 1:07:29.080]  No one will be allowed to have guns.
[1:07:29.080 --> 1:07:31.880]  I ought to play some of those news clips for people that don't believe it.
[1:07:31.880 --> 1:07:35.560]  They put it on the news, said it was great, went around confiscating people's guns, and
[1:07:35.560 --> 1:07:39.680]  then I had to scream for like a month before the NRA said it was bad.
[1:07:39.680 --> 1:07:44.000]  I had blisters calling me going, you're making it up when I was playing the clips.
[1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:46.280]  Stop being in denial.
[1:07:46.280 --> 1:07:51.760]  The governor's announced they're going to use the national guard criminally.
[1:07:51.760 --> 1:07:54.520]  You know, they, they positive commentators said they couldn't use them to even quote
[1:07:54.520 --> 1:08:00.840]  fight terrorists, but they kind of amended it, but this even violates the amended version
[1:08:00.840 --> 1:08:02.880]  of that.
[1:08:02.880 --> 1:08:04.760]  I had a bunch of economic news.
[1:08:04.760 --> 1:08:09.920]  I got a ton of other news I want to go over here.
[1:08:09.920 --> 1:08:15.360]  This is Reuters of his faith in bank bailouts, dims, losses set to deepen.
[1:08:15.360 --> 1:08:21.200]  Another headline, U.S. financial breaking point soon, GM's pain hits retirees.
[1:08:21.200 --> 1:08:23.240]  They just say, you don't get any more healthcare.
[1:08:23.240 --> 1:08:24.240]  We don't care about your pension.
[1:08:24.240 --> 1:08:25.240]  It says zero.
[1:08:25.240 --> 1:08:28.440]  That's Baltimore's son.
[1:08:28.440 --> 1:08:32.320]  As I told you he would do, Al Gore proposes global carbon tax.
[1:08:32.320 --> 1:08:35.560]  I had idiots constantly telling me that wasn't the plan.
[1:08:35.560 --> 1:08:36.680]  I just had their own documents.
[1:08:36.680 --> 1:08:39.800]  I mean, this is a big new world order.
[1:08:39.800 --> 1:08:41.800]  People say, well, they wouldn't get away with this.
[1:08:41.800 --> 1:08:42.800]  People would find out.
[1:08:42.800 --> 1:08:44.920]  We do find out.
[1:08:44.920 --> 1:08:51.800]  It's just your mainline news is five, 10 years late and reporting it to you.
[1:08:51.800 --> 1:08:54.520]  And most of these reporters I talked to aren't bad people.
[1:08:54.520 --> 1:08:58.520]  They're just, they report the press release they're given by government and their editor
[1:08:58.520 --> 1:09:03.720]  won't let them get outside that box.
[1:09:03.720 --> 1:09:04.720]  It doesn't matter.
[1:09:04.720 --> 1:09:07.360]  I'm going to get off into how they got rid of muckrakers and real journalists and how
[1:09:07.360 --> 1:09:12.320]  an average size city like Austin, Texas would have five, six newspapers, something like
[1:09:12.320 --> 1:09:15.040]  New York would have 10, 15 daily papers.
[1:09:15.040 --> 1:09:18.720]  All these cities are down to one or two papers now and it's a bunch of garbage.
[1:09:18.720 --> 1:09:22.200]  The newspapers, and I've seen all the different think tank studies on it, aren't losing
[1:09:22.200 --> 1:09:24.160]  their circulation because of the internet.
[1:09:24.160 --> 1:09:25.560]  That's a small part of it.
[1:09:25.560 --> 1:09:28.440]  It's that it's a bunch of bull and people know it.
[1:09:28.440 --> 1:09:30.080]  We don't want PAP anymore.
[1:09:30.080 --> 1:09:31.080]  You know what PAP is?
[1:09:31.080 --> 1:09:32.080]  It's rice cereal.
[1:09:32.080 --> 1:09:34.880]  It's the first food you feed a baby.
[1:09:34.880 --> 1:09:38.280]  I've got a five month old and we just started giving her PAP.
[1:09:38.280 --> 1:09:39.520]  People don't want PAP.
[1:09:39.520 --> 1:09:40.680]  I'm 34 years old.
[1:09:40.680 --> 1:09:42.920]  I want a big bone in ribeye.
[1:09:42.920 --> 1:09:45.240]  I want, I want mashed potatoes.
[1:09:45.240 --> 1:09:48.160]  I want a big blue tea salad.
[1:09:48.160 --> 1:09:50.640]  Well, that's what this show is, baby.
[1:09:50.640 --> 1:09:55.440]  Big, giant, 25 ounce prime bone in ribeye, baby.
[1:09:55.440 --> 1:09:58.240]  All the juicy fat, all the juicy beef.
[1:09:58.240 --> 1:09:59.240]  Everything you want.
[1:09:59.240 --> 1:10:07.560]  And we could save this country if you get off the diet of rice cereal.
[1:10:07.560 --> 1:10:08.560]  I mean, good Lord.
[1:10:08.560 --> 1:10:09.560]  All right.
[1:10:09.560 --> 1:10:10.560]  I said I'd go to calls.
[1:10:10.560 --> 1:10:11.560]  Let's go to them.
[1:10:11.560 --> 1:10:14.360]  Let's talk to Hamilton in Boulder, Colorado.
[1:10:14.360 --> 1:10:18.480]  Thank you for holding Hamilton.
[1:10:18.480 --> 1:10:23.160]  I'm so used to having the folks on the daily show go to the calls for me.
[1:10:23.160 --> 1:10:26.560]  I've got to shift back into the other gear.
[1:10:26.560 --> 1:10:30.440]  Let's go ahead and go to Hamilton.
[1:10:30.440 --> 1:10:31.440]  You're on the air, Hamilton.
[1:10:31.440 --> 1:10:32.440]  Hey, Alex.
[1:10:32.440 --> 1:10:34.440]  Interest and times are living in.
[1:10:34.440 --> 1:10:35.440]  Yes, sir.
[1:10:35.440 --> 1:10:36.440]  What's on your mind?
[1:10:36.440 --> 1:10:38.520]  Well, it's a computer thing.
[1:10:38.520 --> 1:10:42.840]  I'm sure everyone listening wants their computer to obey them and not someone else.
[1:10:42.840 --> 1:10:49.000]  Well, I want to alert your listeners to something called a TPM chip, which is a trusted computing
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  module.
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  Have you heard of this, Heather?
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:54.040]  I know there's a lot of stuff coming with them, standard the tracks and controls and
[1:10:54.040 --> 1:10:58.080]  lets Microsoft dial in and download, and then it's all loving.
[1:10:58.080 --> 1:10:59.080]  Oh, yeah.
[1:10:59.080 --> 1:11:04.560]  It's developed by something, an organization called the Trusting Computing Platform Alliance,
[1:11:04.560 --> 1:11:07.440]  and it was originally codenamed Palladium by Microsoft.
[1:11:07.440 --> 1:11:12.120]  It's already in many computer motherboards since 2006, and Game Console has already used
[1:11:12.120 --> 1:11:14.720]  systems like this to prevent running on offer.
[1:11:14.720 --> 1:11:19.960]  Hey, Google announced two years ago that they're using the cameras and all the new computers
[1:11:19.960 --> 1:11:22.840]  to watch you, and I say it, and people don't believe me.
[1:11:22.840 --> 1:11:26.280]  You can't make this stuff up, but I guess that's not a big brother.
[1:11:26.280 --> 1:11:27.800]  It's like some science fiction or something.
[1:11:27.800 --> 1:11:29.320]  Well, anyway, everything's wonderful.
[1:11:29.320 --> 1:11:30.320]  The coffins are good.
[1:11:30.320 --> 1:11:31.320]  Go ahead.
[1:11:31.320 --> 1:11:34.440]  This is going to be marketed as a security feature that will, they'll say it's going
[1:11:34.440 --> 1:11:37.400]  to keep you safe, tolerable, and not, don't listen to that.
[1:11:37.400 --> 1:11:40.840]  Well, it's like thumb scanning, but Microsoft said eight years ago when the feds asked them
[1:11:40.840 --> 1:11:43.040]  to do it, they wanted to phase it in by 06.
[1:11:43.040 --> 1:11:45.720]  People don't want it, but you notice a lot of the new keyboards have a thumb printer
[1:11:45.720 --> 1:11:48.120]  or a finger access, index finger access.
[1:11:48.120 --> 1:11:49.120]  Oh, yeah.
[1:11:49.120 --> 1:11:50.120]  I was with some guy.
[1:11:50.120 --> 1:11:51.120]  He was like, isn't that cool?
[1:11:51.120 --> 1:11:52.120]  And I was like.
[1:11:52.120 --> 1:11:53.120]  It's not cool.
[1:11:53.120 --> 1:11:57.240]  The Homeland Security info right here, that is actually for the new law they want to pass
[1:11:57.240 --> 1:12:04.200]  to make it database where you log on to track everything you do on the web for the children.
[1:12:04.200 --> 1:12:05.200]  And trusted computing.
[1:12:05.200 --> 1:12:06.800]  This thing is called trusted computing.
[1:12:06.800 --> 1:12:08.120]  Oh, it's trusted.
[1:12:08.120 --> 1:12:09.720]  It's like Homeland Security.
[1:12:09.720 --> 1:12:10.720]  I mean, all these names.
[1:12:10.720 --> 1:12:14.720]  Listen, the shock break bracelets, Homeland Security wants every American to wear.
[1:12:14.720 --> 1:12:15.720]  I'm not kidding.
[1:12:15.720 --> 1:12:19.120]  It was four months after we reported it was in the Washington Post last week.
[1:12:19.120 --> 1:12:20.120]  Yeah.
[1:12:20.120 --> 1:12:22.240]  But here's what's incredible.
[1:12:22.240 --> 1:12:25.920]  Listen to me listeners, cameras watching in your computers, Homeland Security wants everybody
[1:12:25.920 --> 1:12:29.480]  who gets on a plane, everyone to wear a taser bracelet.
[1:12:29.480 --> 1:12:30.480]  And what do they call it?
[1:12:30.480 --> 1:12:32.120]  A safety bracelet.
[1:12:32.120 --> 1:12:35.320]  See how they manipulate things, but go ahead, I'll shut up.
[1:12:35.320 --> 1:12:37.240]  It really should be called treacherous computing.
[1:12:37.240 --> 1:12:41.360]  I mean, the encryption keys are going to be kept a secret from you and how your computer
[1:12:41.360 --> 1:12:44.320]  works is going to be under the control of those with the encryption keys.
[1:12:44.320 --> 1:12:49.160]  And it's going to be Microsoft, IBM, the government, I mean the potential for abuse
[1:12:49.160 --> 1:12:50.160]  of this.
[1:12:50.160 --> 1:12:52.760]  Well, Microsoft and IBM are national security fronts.
[1:12:52.760 --> 1:12:58.160]  I mean, IBM was a division of Adolf Hitler's military.
[1:12:58.160 --> 1:13:00.360]  By the way, that's mainstream history for those that don't know.
[1:13:00.360 --> 1:13:03.160]  It is a division of that.
[1:13:03.160 --> 1:13:06.280]  And then of course, Microsoft's another, you know, front for the NSA.
[1:13:06.280 --> 1:13:07.280]  Go ahead.
[1:13:07.280 --> 1:13:10.960]  Well, the potential for the abuse of this is just horrible.
[1:13:10.960 --> 1:13:15.000]  And it's a criminal violation to circumvent this system under the Digital Millennium Copyright
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:17.240]  Act, which was signed by Bill Clinton in 1998.
[1:13:17.240 --> 1:13:18.240]  Yes.
[1:13:18.240 --> 1:13:23.400]  Well, Google, I want your listeners to Google the article, Can You Trust Your Computer?
[1:13:23.400 --> 1:13:29.240]  Written by Richard Stallman, who was in the AI lab at MIT.
[1:13:29.240 --> 1:13:30.920]  That was Wired Magazine, correct?
[1:13:30.920 --> 1:13:31.920]  Yeah.
[1:13:31.920 --> 1:13:33.440]  You should get him on your show.
[1:13:33.440 --> 1:13:35.440]  In fact, he could talk to you all day.
[1:13:35.440 --> 1:13:36.440]  No, no, no.
[1:13:36.440 --> 1:13:37.440]  A month ago, I told Eddie Bear to get him on.
[1:13:37.440 --> 1:13:38.440]  That's Trey's nickname.
[1:13:38.440 --> 1:13:41.240]  That's his girlfriend calls him that, so he would joke now.
[1:13:41.240 --> 1:13:43.160]  There's a wallace called Pickle Bear.
[1:13:43.160 --> 1:13:47.320]  But why don't you, why don't you, I've got to throw some fun in here as everything goes
[1:13:47.320 --> 1:13:48.320]  down the handbasket.
[1:13:48.320 --> 1:13:50.520]  Why don't you email Trey that, because I'll end up forgetting.
[1:13:50.520 --> 1:13:54.240]  I've got to go work on a book I'm writing for two hours, right when I go off air.
[1:13:54.240 --> 1:13:58.080]  Then I'm looking at a film, Bermas is Making, which I'm kind of master directing.
[1:13:58.080 --> 1:13:59.080]  He's the director.
[1:13:59.080 --> 1:14:03.000]  So I'm kind of full tonight, but I don't want to forget, I meant to have that guy on.
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  Trey with an E at infowars.com.
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:07.960]  E-I, at infowars, all right, we'll do it.
[1:14:07.960 --> 1:14:08.960]  E-R-E-Y.
[1:14:08.960 --> 1:14:12.400]  But for those that don't know, here's the courier news.
[1:14:12.400 --> 1:14:16.560]  Cops use Department of Homeland Security money to scan fingerprints at checkpoints.
[1:14:16.560 --> 1:14:23.120]  And it says in LA and in San Diego, 500 mobile fingerprint scanners at random checkpoints.
[1:14:23.120 --> 1:14:25.960]  Oh, that's land of the free home of the brave.
[1:14:25.960 --> 1:14:27.480]  Cops basically scanning you.
[1:14:27.480 --> 1:14:29.600]  Remember, you scan to get your driver's license.
[1:14:29.600 --> 1:14:34.840]  I told you this would happen 11 years ago, because I had the executive order.
[1:14:34.840 --> 1:14:37.600]  Here we are.
[1:14:37.600 --> 1:14:42.200]  When they hit you with a bio weapon, just don't believe the television as you crawl around
[1:14:42.200 --> 1:14:46.400]  dying with your children, watching your television as the bio attack goes on, just at least
[1:14:46.400 --> 1:14:49.200]  know the government killed you when you're dying, America.
[1:14:49.200 --> 1:14:50.920]  At least do that, okay?
[1:14:50.920 --> 1:14:55.320]  At least admit I was right when you're dying, because this whole police state, Greg, is
[1:14:55.320 --> 1:14:57.280]  so they can bio attack you.
[1:14:57.280 --> 1:14:58.280]  Anything else, sir?
[1:14:58.280 --> 1:15:01.680]  C-I heard you might go to the DNC in Denver.
[1:15:01.680 --> 1:15:02.680]  I might go to that myself.
[1:15:02.680 --> 1:15:03.680]  E-I'm going.
[1:15:03.680 --> 1:15:04.680]  C-I'm going.
[1:15:04.680 --> 1:15:05.680]  C-I might see you there.
[1:15:05.680 --> 1:15:06.680]  E-All right.
[1:15:06.680 --> 1:15:07.680]  I'll be flapping about.
[1:15:07.680 --> 1:15:08.680]  C-Okay.
[1:15:08.680 --> 1:15:09.680]  E-Hey, brother.
[1:15:09.680 --> 1:15:10.680]  I like it.
[1:15:10.680 --> 1:15:11.680]  Thanks for the call.
[1:15:11.680 --> 1:15:12.680]  C-Yeah.
[1:15:12.680 --> 1:15:13.680]  E-Yeah.
[1:15:13.680 --> 1:15:14.680]  Here it is.
[1:15:14.680 --> 1:15:15.680]  It's all over, folks.
[1:15:15.680 --> 1:15:17.920]  I don't know what I'm supposed to do here.
[1:15:17.920 --> 1:15:20.600]  I mean, you know, I'm just a normal guy.
[1:15:20.600 --> 1:15:21.600]  I read the Telecommunications Act.
[1:15:21.600 --> 1:15:24.720]  They say they're going to listen to all your phone calls without warrants and track you
[1:15:24.720 --> 1:15:25.720]  down to three feet.
[1:15:25.720 --> 1:15:29.760]  So I'll tell you about it, 10 years ago, 12 years ago.
[1:15:29.760 --> 1:15:34.840]  I Google announces they're watching you with cameras and microphones and all the computers,
[1:15:34.840 --> 1:15:38.440]  and all the new computers have it, most of the old, and I mean, I'm just freaking out
[1:15:38.440 --> 1:15:39.440]  here.
[1:15:39.440 --> 1:15:40.440]  I know you think that's normal.
[1:15:40.440 --> 1:15:41.440]  You know me?
[1:15:41.440 --> 1:15:42.440]  I don't think it's normal.
[1:15:42.440 --> 1:15:50.120]  Here's your call straight ahead, 877-590-5525.
[1:15:50.120 --> 1:15:53.880]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources, July 18, 2008.
[1:15:53.880 --> 1:15:55.960]  Gold opened at 9.5460oz.
[1:15:55.960 --> 1:16:02.160]  One ounce gold coins can be purchased for 9.8185, 483.50 for half ounce, and 241.75
[1:16:02.160 --> 1:16:03.160]  for quarter ounce.
[1:16:03.160 --> 1:16:07.840]  That's 9.8185, 483.50, and 241.75.
[1:16:07.840 --> 1:16:12.760]  Edge funds cut in the malaise of mortgage bankruptcies, the bond market continues to slump, JP Morgan
[1:16:12.760 --> 1:16:18.680]  gets caught in a 10 billion bad deal for Chrysler, housing sales fell 6.6%, mortgage giant countrywide
[1:16:18.680 --> 1:16:22.880]  showed mortgage payment woes, spreading to the middle and upper class, investors cast
[1:16:22.880 --> 1:16:27.320]  out on investment banks, credit protection insurance for mortgage lenders, or skyrocketing
[1:16:27.320 --> 1:16:28.920]  due to the increased risk.
[1:16:28.920 --> 1:16:32.960]  The US dollar is free falling against foreign currencies in countries that previously financed
[1:16:32.960 --> 1:16:35.960]  the US are now seeking safer alternatives.
[1:16:35.960 --> 1:16:41.840]  This really boy published the report bubble leaking, call for the report today, 800-686-2237.
[1:16:41.840 --> 1:16:47.440]  The value of your hard earned money is being lost in a global game of chess, call 800-686-2237.
[1:16:47.440 --> 1:16:50.760]  That's 800-686-2237.
[1:16:50.760 --> 1:16:54.640]  It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[1:16:54.640 --> 1:16:59.560]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[1:16:59.560 --> 1:17:04.280]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the
[1:17:04.280 --> 1:17:08.960]  US, though the people of the US where their numbers and influence are strongest have primary
[1:17:08.960 --> 1:17:13.800]  responsibility for reigning the men and bringing them to justice, all nations will participate
[1:17:13.800 --> 1:17:16.040]  since they reside the world over.
[1:17:16.040 --> 1:17:20.440]  They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the new world order.
[1:17:20.440 --> 1:17:23.200]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[1:17:23.200 --> 1:17:27.720]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago, everything they have built
[1:17:27.720 --> 1:17:32.400]  over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning
[1:17:32.400 --> 1:17:37.400]  of the masses, the destruction of the earth and mankind, we will undo through the authority
[1:17:37.400 --> 1:17:39.960]  that has now been delegated to us.
[1:17:39.960 --> 1:17:48.400]  Visit our website at unveilingthem.com, that's U-N-V-E-I-L-I-N-G, them.com, the message of
[1:17:48.400 --> 1:17:49.400]  his kingdom.
[1:17:49.400 --> 1:17:52.200]  Hey Emily, wow you look great.
[1:17:52.200 --> 1:17:53.320]  I feel great.
[1:17:53.320 --> 1:17:55.400]  I've been using Medi-Clinz, Colon-Clinz.
[1:17:55.400 --> 1:17:56.400]  Really?
[1:17:56.400 --> 1:17:57.400]  What is it?
[1:17:57.400 --> 1:17:58.400]  How does it work?
[1:17:58.400 --> 1:18:02.720]  It's all fiber therapy with ground flaxseed, psyllium and bentonite clay that eliminates
[1:18:02.720 --> 1:18:04.320]  toxins from your body.
[1:18:04.320 --> 1:18:06.520]  Medi-Clinz is easy to use without being intrusive.
[1:18:06.520 --> 1:18:10.920]  You take two tablespoons of Medi-Clinz powder, mix with water or juice, drink, and it does
[1:18:10.920 --> 1:18:11.920]  all the work for you.
[1:18:11.920 --> 1:18:12.920]  That's it?
[1:18:12.920 --> 1:18:14.680]  That sounds so easy and convenient.
[1:18:14.680 --> 1:18:15.680]  It is easy.
[1:18:15.680 --> 1:18:20.360]  Plus, the FDA says flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss,
[1:18:20.360 --> 1:18:22.560]  irritable bowel syndrome and constipation.
[1:18:22.560 --> 1:18:24.480]  It helps with all of those elements?
[1:18:24.480 --> 1:18:25.480]  That's amazing.
[1:18:25.480 --> 1:18:31.040]  And the bentonite clay in Medi-Clinz eliminates viruses and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[1:18:31.040 --> 1:18:32.960]  Wow, where can I buy Medi-Clinz?
[1:18:32.960 --> 1:18:36.080]  A one month supply is available online at Medi-Clinz.com.

[1:18:59.240 --> 1:19:04.200]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes, and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat
[1:19:04.200 --> 1:19:07.640]  are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[1:19:07.640 --> 1:19:12.400]  Here, how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[1:19:12.400 --> 1:19:13.400]  across America.

[1:19:17.400 --> 1:19:21.040]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much
[1:19:21.040 --> 1:19:22.040]  healthier I feel.
[1:19:22.040 --> 1:19:24.720]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[1:19:24.720 --> 1:19:29.920]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative
[1:19:29.920 --> 1:19:32.440]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[1:20:36.720 --> 1:20:41.880]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher and it burns.
[1:20:41.880 --> 1:20:50.480]  Hey, police, you're not getting fallujah-controlling type technology for us idiot morons civilians
[1:20:50.480 --> 1:20:53.200]  as you call us with your military terminology.
[1:20:53.200 --> 1:20:56.720]  I live on mayor's call of civilians, and that's proper.
[1:20:56.720 --> 1:20:58.280]  We're in a military dictatorship.
[1:20:58.280 --> 1:21:03.760]  You need to understand, police, you're going to be hurt by your criminal overlords, too.
[1:21:03.760 --> 1:21:07.240]  So just keep lying to yourself and saying the government's good, you're going to find
[1:21:07.240 --> 1:21:08.240]  out.
[1:21:08.240 --> 1:21:11.760]  Cops use DHS money to scan fingerprints at checkpoints.
[1:21:11.760 --> 1:21:14.400]  This is the courier newspaper.
[1:21:14.400 --> 1:21:19.200]  High-tech gadget instantly reveals identities, and it talks about a homeland security paid
[1:21:19.200 --> 1:21:25.680]  to give the LAPD 500 of them and how they, it says they randomly stopped over 2,000 vehicles
[1:21:25.680 --> 1:21:27.760]  and scanned every one of them.
[1:21:27.760 --> 1:21:29.520]  Guilty until proven innocent.
[1:21:29.520 --> 1:21:31.760]  Just all right, put your thumb on here.
[1:21:31.760 --> 1:21:37.720]  Oh, and it says that they made 14 arrests and one of them for a parole violator.
[1:21:37.720 --> 1:21:39.640]  Guilty until proven innocent.
[1:21:39.640 --> 1:21:44.040]  Remember what the Germans could have done with a thumb scanner, and I see, notice, magically
[1:21:44.040 --> 1:21:48.720]  all these states just magically have your thumb print for the last 10 years as they
[1:21:48.720 --> 1:21:49.720]  phase it in.
[1:21:49.720 --> 1:21:54.400]  Texas, before that, we were the first state, 93, it was put in, the DPS, and I talked to
[1:21:54.400 --> 1:21:55.400]  people in Texas.
[1:21:55.400 --> 1:21:56.400]  I go, don't you remember thumb printing?
[1:21:56.400 --> 1:21:57.560]  And they go, no, that's a conspiracy.
[1:21:57.560 --> 1:22:02.040]  And I go, remember the little box, the red line, oh, yeah.
[1:22:02.040 --> 1:22:07.640]  But they'll go, well, wait a minute, that wasn't a thumb printer, it won't know ink.
[1:22:07.640 --> 1:22:12.480]  I mean, they're just built to deny, built to be slaves, built to never admit, I'm just
[1:22:12.480 --> 1:22:17.520]  like fine, you didn't get thumb printed, oh, there's nothing you slaves won't take.
[1:22:17.520 --> 1:22:22.600]  But I'll never forget, right before Tom Brokaw retired, when the last newscast he did, I
[1:22:22.600 --> 1:22:25.960]  had it on tape, they announced what was in Fallujah, and they said that first they told
[1:22:25.960 --> 1:22:29.880]  everybody to leave the city, those that didn't, they artilleryed the entire place, bombed
[1:22:29.880 --> 1:22:32.960]  it, killed tens of thousands, women, children, you name it, and then everybody that came
[1:22:32.960 --> 1:22:36.840]  back in got thumb printed face scan and given a card.
[1:22:36.840 --> 1:22:41.600]  And that's the same system, see, the same that all 50 states have, it's a global system.
[1:22:41.600 --> 1:22:44.040]  And they told him, it was on the news, they said, if you ever get caught without this
[1:22:44.040 --> 1:22:46.200]  card, you will be shot on the spot.
[1:22:46.200 --> 1:22:49.880]  And then if you read actual policy, they just line you up and kill you if you don't have
[1:22:49.880 --> 1:22:54.160]  it, in, quote, certain sectors, kind of like a private gruckheimer came back to the Ithaca
[1:22:54.160 --> 1:22:58.680]  Journal in 2002 and said, oh, we go into villages and kill every man, woman, and child.
[1:22:58.680 --> 1:23:02.160]  And then the army came out and said, well, we want to clarify, that's only in certain
[1:23:02.160 --> 1:23:05.920]  zones do we kill all the women and children.
[1:23:05.920 --> 1:23:08.360]  War crimes, pure evil.
[1:23:08.360 --> 1:23:11.400]  People are flipping out though, they're taking my challenge to read the White House memos
[1:23:11.400 --> 1:23:13.080]  about torturing children.
[1:23:13.080 --> 1:23:16.000]  We were just in there on YouTube a minute ago, reading the comments as folks flip out
[1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:20.200]  on this one page, going and reading the White House documents about torturing small children.
[1:23:20.200 --> 1:23:23.120]  Yep, you see, it's true.
[1:23:23.120 --> 1:23:26.520]  You are being watched at the camera on your computer and the microphone.
[1:23:26.520 --> 1:23:31.920]  Your digital cable boxes do track and trace and listen to you audibly with AI audio systems.
[1:23:31.920 --> 1:23:38.040]  I said, I go to your calls, you know, it's just, I'm not the radical here.
[1:23:38.040 --> 1:23:42.880]  I'm one of the normal sane people.
[1:23:42.880 --> 1:23:44.680]  So no fourth amendment.
[1:23:44.680 --> 1:23:49.480]  And then when people try to videotape these illegal unconstitutional thumb scanning checkpoints,
[1:23:49.480 --> 1:23:51.920]  the cops come over and arrest you.
[1:23:51.920 --> 1:23:56.280]  Man, they're going to videotape us the slaves, but you don't videotape God.
[1:23:56.280 --> 1:23:58.880]  You understand, you just wait and enjoy it.
[1:23:58.880 --> 1:24:01.960]  Many cops when your mom and dad lose their pensions, but you're still out getting to
[1:24:01.960 --> 1:24:02.960]  feed on us.
[1:24:02.960 --> 1:24:03.960]  Don't worry.
[1:24:03.960 --> 1:24:08.160]  When your wife loses her job, when your husband loses it, that's your loving government.
[1:24:08.160 --> 1:24:10.600]  That's your loving new world order.
[1:24:10.600 --> 1:24:17.920]  And when your 18 year old son dies of a fast-acting glaucoma or, you know, fast-acting leukemia,
[1:24:17.920 --> 1:24:20.640]  just go take more vaccines, all right?
[1:24:20.640 --> 1:24:22.000]  Don't believe people like me.
[1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:25.880]  It doesn't matter if I had a medical doctor and a scientist on last week reading all the
[1:24:25.880 --> 1:24:31.360]  declassified documents where they put cancer viruses in your shots or how they engineered
[1:24:31.360 --> 1:24:32.520]  AIDS.
[1:24:32.520 --> 1:24:34.400]  Don't believe me.
[1:24:34.400 --> 1:24:37.360]  Don't believe the statistics of one in 33 would get cancer.
[1:24:37.360 --> 1:24:39.600]  And now it's one in three.
[1:24:39.600 --> 1:24:42.080]  Just believe your loving government.
[1:24:42.080 --> 1:24:45.640]  Don't believe Alex Jones because it doesn't matter.
[1:24:45.640 --> 1:24:48.880]  Your masters are going to hurt you just as bad as they hurt me.
[1:24:48.880 --> 1:24:49.880]  And you know what?
[1:24:49.880 --> 1:24:51.480]  You're going to get what's coming to you.
[1:24:51.480 --> 1:24:55.920]  Your masters that you love are going to hurt you real bad.
[1:24:55.920 --> 1:24:56.920]  And you know what?
[1:24:56.920 --> 1:24:57.920]  I'm mad.
[1:24:57.920 --> 1:24:58.920]  I'm mad that I have to do this.
[1:24:58.920 --> 1:25:00.400]  I'm mad that my life's ruined.
[1:25:00.400 --> 1:25:06.280]  I'm mad that such a sick world we live in with this candy-coated bull of all these fake
[1:25:06.280 --> 1:25:10.960]  newscasters that are trained to, you know, the women to look at you like they care about
[1:25:10.960 --> 1:25:15.120]  you and they like you, you know, they train those female anchors to act like they're coming
[1:25:15.120 --> 1:25:16.120]  on to you.
[1:25:16.120 --> 1:25:17.680]  And you think the TV screen's real.
[1:25:17.680 --> 1:25:21.800]  You think she's really there coming on to you at a subconscious level or the fake guy
[1:25:21.800 --> 1:25:23.920]  acting like the good, trustworthy football coach.
[1:25:23.920 --> 1:25:27.520]  They have these different archetypes for different newscasters manipulating you.
[1:25:27.520 --> 1:25:29.000]  And of course, they're just idiot morons.
[1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:31.000]  They don't know anything either.
[1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:36.120]  They're just there playing their little part to sell you death while I refuse to take part
[1:25:36.120 --> 1:25:38.560]  in it anymore.
[1:25:38.560 --> 1:25:42.680]  Let's go ahead and talk to Forrest, then Joyce, Tom, Paul, and others.
[1:25:42.680 --> 1:25:47.600]  Forrest from California are on the air.
[1:25:47.600 --> 1:25:48.600]  Go ahead.
[1:25:48.600 --> 1:25:55.440]  Your show has given us so much inspiration, and all the modern heroes, such as you and
[1:25:55.440 --> 1:26:00.840]  Tex-Mars and Jordan, were not well, and that man that was on the other day, on Friday.
[1:26:00.840 --> 1:26:06.240]  It's just given us so much faith energy, and what we always got to realize is that our
[1:26:06.240 --> 1:26:11.160]  eye is on the prize, and that is of peace and harmony and of prosperity, and those are
[1:26:11.160 --> 1:26:12.400]  things of God.
[1:26:12.400 --> 1:26:13.400]  And God's coming.
[1:26:13.400 --> 1:26:18.240]  It all depends on us.
[1:26:18.240 --> 1:26:22.400]  The problem is the sold-out churches on international payroll.
[1:26:22.400 --> 1:26:26.680]  Most preachers, 26,000, that's most your prominent preachers, have already been hired
[1:26:26.680 --> 1:26:28.320]  for two and a half years.
[1:26:28.320 --> 1:26:31.320]  They're paid to give false sermons.
[1:26:31.320 --> 1:26:34.440]  They are, you understand the preachers are paid by the government.
[1:26:34.440 --> 1:26:37.040]  I told you a year before it was mainstream news.
[1:26:37.040 --> 1:26:38.040]  Yes, sir.
[1:26:38.040 --> 1:26:41.440]  I mean, that's total tyranny right there.
[1:26:41.440 --> 1:26:42.440]  Yeah.
[1:26:42.440 --> 1:26:44.560]  They're really funded preachers everywhere.
[1:26:44.560 --> 1:26:45.560]  God help us.
[1:26:45.560 --> 1:26:46.560]  Yeah.
[1:26:46.560 --> 1:26:52.240]  You've been very prophetic through your movies and through your internet news information,
[1:26:52.240 --> 1:26:53.960]  and through your talk range.
[1:26:53.960 --> 1:26:57.280]  I told you you'd have checkpoints 10 years ago, thumb-scanning you.
[1:26:57.280 --> 1:26:58.280]  Yes, sir.
[1:26:58.280 --> 1:27:03.040]  I got a stack of them all over the country doing it.
[1:27:03.040 --> 1:27:04.600]  Washington Post, you name it.
[1:27:04.600 --> 1:27:05.600]  Go ahead.
[1:27:05.600 --> 1:27:06.600]  Yes, sir.
[1:27:06.600 --> 1:27:15.520]  I mean, all these things, it's all part of the process because at the end, God's coming
[1:27:15.520 --> 1:27:18.480]  and it is coming from us and from His planet.
[1:27:18.480 --> 1:27:22.960]  That's why the establishment is really stepping up things and it has to do with the planetary
[1:27:22.960 --> 1:27:29.280]  alignment because each one of us has so much awesome energy that we can receive from God.
[1:27:29.280 --> 1:27:32.800]  The main deal is I don't get into all of the esoteric and the rest of it.
[1:27:32.800 --> 1:27:36.720]  I cover that because the elite believe in it, okay?
[1:27:36.720 --> 1:27:39.400]  They thought it was the end of the world when Hitler was killing people.
[1:27:39.400 --> 1:27:42.960]  They thought it was the end of the world in Russia when Stalin and Lenin were doing it.
[1:27:42.960 --> 1:27:46.360]  They thought it was the end of the world in Cambodia, okay?
[1:27:46.360 --> 1:27:49.560]  And I'm not saying you're not standing up and fighting, but most of these church people
[1:27:49.560 --> 1:27:52.660]  think they're going to get raptured out of this and they always think it.
[1:27:52.660 --> 1:27:56.400]  And when they're losing their houses and their pension funds, but a lot of them are
[1:27:56.400 --> 1:27:59.200]  just going to go put black uniforms on and strut around and love the system.
[1:27:59.200 --> 1:28:02.480]  They're just cowards, a nation of cowardly filth.
[1:28:02.480 --> 1:28:04.720]  I don't want to hear that we're not a nation of cowardly filth either.
[1:28:04.720 --> 1:28:07.240]  We have killed 50 million babies with abortion.
[1:28:07.240 --> 1:28:13.320]  We show a lot of good people in this country and I love this country.
[1:28:13.320 --> 1:28:16.880]  We're just like the rest of the world falling into absolute despotism.
[1:28:16.880 --> 1:28:20.640]  There are a lot of evil people that want to eat your lunch and push you around and control
[1:28:20.640 --> 1:28:24.040]  you and then use high tech propaganda to do it.
[1:28:24.040 --> 1:28:27.920]  Now it's time for you to wake up and admit I've been right about it all.
[1:28:27.920 --> 1:28:30.040]  I'm talking to all the deniers out there.
[1:28:30.040 --> 1:28:33.240]  You've been listening to me for a long time a bunch of you and you know it's all getting
[1:28:33.240 --> 1:28:34.240]  bad.
[1:28:34.240 --> 1:28:36.160]  It's going to get a lot worse if you don't wake up.
[1:28:36.160 --> 1:28:40.560]  You understand they're going to move on us and really get bad if you don't wake up.
[1:28:40.560 --> 1:28:41.560]  You understand?
[1:28:41.560 --> 1:28:42.560]  If you don't stand up, it's over.
[1:28:42.560 --> 1:28:43.560]  You understand that?
[1:28:43.560 --> 1:28:57.240]  Warning, the EPA states indoor air pollution is the number one health problem today causing
[1:28:57.240 --> 1:29:02.480]  50% of all illnesses go to germfree33.com.

[1:31:53.640 --> 1:31:55.400]  world health is staggering.
[1:31:55.400 --> 1:31:59.720]  We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[1:31:59.720 --> 1:32:04.120]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world
[1:32:04.120 --> 1:32:09.080]  in which we live is unable to remove all toxins, the solution.

[1:33:09.000 --> 1:33:13.440]  I'm a very calm person in private.
[1:33:13.440 --> 1:33:18.640]  I get on air and I start thinking about police running warrantless checkpoints, thumb scanning
[1:33:18.640 --> 1:33:25.720]  people, taking blood, no due process, everything falling apart, the dollar dying, the idiot
[1:33:25.720 --> 1:33:26.720]  public has no idea.
[1:33:26.720 --> 1:33:31.240]  I mean, I talk to people who are in business, who are successful, who are millionaires and
[1:33:31.240 --> 1:33:32.240]  they don't know.
[1:33:32.240 --> 1:33:37.760]  I happened to be at a meeting a few, I don't know, like a month ago and there had to be
[1:33:37.760 --> 1:33:41.920]  a pretty good sized oil company owner there, wasn't one of the majors, but you know, the
[1:33:41.920 --> 1:33:47.040]  guy's worth hundreds of millions of dollars and he didn't know the dollar was devalued.
[1:33:47.040 --> 1:33:52.280]  I mean, he just, what is wrong with you people?
[1:33:52.280 --> 1:33:59.000]  What is wrong?
[1:33:59.000 --> 1:34:04.760]  And I just saw Al Gore, who was in my hometown, Austin, my adopted hometown, I'm actually
[1:34:04.760 --> 1:34:12.000]  from Dallas, and running around spreading his propaganda, you guys, it's just all fake.
[1:34:12.000 --> 1:34:13.000]  There's no liberal conservative.
[1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:14.240]  They want a global tax.
[1:34:14.240 --> 1:34:16.480]  He finally proposes it.
[1:34:16.480 --> 1:34:27.080]  This is the liar that in 1992 said that he invented the Internet.
[1:34:27.080 --> 1:34:28.080]  Was it 94?
[1:34:28.080 --> 1:34:29.080]  I forget.
[1:34:29.080 --> 1:34:40.200]  The Internet was admittedly originally developed in the mid-60s by MIT, the Pentagon DARPA.
[1:34:40.200 --> 1:34:43.600]  And then in the 70s, what you could call the Internet was really born.
[1:34:43.600 --> 1:34:48.800]  And when you go to the Wikipedia page or the Encyclopedia page or TV shows about the making
[1:34:48.800 --> 1:34:54.000]  of the Internet, years ago I interviewed the guy, the British Lord now, who was credited
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:55.000]  with designing it.
[1:34:55.000 --> 1:34:56.000]  I know he's a knight.
[1:34:56.000 --> 1:34:57.000]  He was knighted for it.
[1:34:57.000 --> 1:34:59.800]  I guess that kind of makes him a lord, but it doesn't matter.
[1:34:59.800 --> 1:35:03.720]  The point is that Al Gore has no claim on that.
[1:35:03.720 --> 1:35:05.520]  He just lies.
[1:35:05.520 --> 1:35:09.840]  But that's why he gets a Nobel Prize by the big globalists, because they love congenital
[1:35:09.840 --> 1:35:11.340]  liars.
[1:35:11.340 --> 1:35:15.880]  They absolutely love this dirt bag out lying, saying the earth is heating up because of
[1:35:15.880 --> 1:35:18.040]  carbon dioxide.
[1:35:18.040 --> 1:35:22.080]  When all the major studies show that's a fraud, and the earth heating up is a good thing,
[1:35:22.080 --> 1:35:27.880]  but the sun has been heating for decades, and now it started cooling.
[1:35:27.880 --> 1:35:29.360]  But facts don't matter.
[1:35:29.360 --> 1:35:33.320]  If he says he invented the Internet, maybe he made God.
[1:35:33.320 --> 1:35:35.920]  Maybe Al Gore gave birth to God.
[1:35:35.920 --> 1:35:37.560]  Maybe Al Gore created the Big Bang.
[1:35:37.560 --> 1:35:44.560]  I mean, why not just say Al Gore is God, degenerate piece of trash, and I have to watch all these
[1:35:44.560 --> 1:35:50.640]  idiot liberals just worshiping Bill Clinton and Al Gore and all these scum.
[1:35:50.640 --> 1:35:53.000]  They're just as bad as the George Bush worshipers.
[1:35:53.000 --> 1:35:57.280]  Again, you couldn't wake up to Bill Clinton's evil because he was a liberal, and you'd invested
[1:35:57.280 --> 1:36:01.120]  your personal power in it.
[1:36:01.120 --> 1:36:07.040]  You associate your power with it, and with George Bush, all these fake conservatives,
[1:36:07.040 --> 1:36:08.280]  you couldn't wake up.
[1:36:08.280 --> 1:36:11.720]  It's time to wake up to the left-right paradigm, and people have done that.
[1:36:11.720 --> 1:36:13.600]  Congress has an 11% approval rating.
[1:36:13.600 --> 1:36:15.240]  That's the first time anything like that's ever happened.
[1:36:15.240 --> 1:36:19.080]  I mean, it never got below the 30s.
[1:36:19.080 --> 1:36:22.040]  Just a few years ago, both parties are hated.
[1:36:22.040 --> 1:36:24.280]  That's the good news, corrupt people.
[1:36:24.280 --> 1:36:25.880]  You better know the jig's up.
[1:36:25.880 --> 1:36:29.400]  Now the public doesn't have an inkling how bad it is, but they've got an inkling that
[1:36:29.400 --> 1:36:33.200]  they're being screwed and lied to, and that it doesn't matter what party's what.
[1:36:33.200 --> 1:36:36.560]  So don't get fooled by this big spectacle and all this baloney.
[1:36:36.560 --> 1:36:40.680]  I'm only going to the DNC and maybe the RNC, too, because they're banning protests.
[1:36:40.680 --> 1:36:43.640]  They've got microwave guns out there, sound cannons.
[1:36:43.640 --> 1:36:49.320]  I want to catch cops revocaturing like we've caught them in other places.
[1:36:49.320 --> 1:36:50.800]  Yeah, cops dressed up like anarchists.
[1:36:50.800 --> 1:36:53.880]  I want to bust them again, blow their cover again.
[1:36:53.880 --> 1:36:58.160]  I just absolutely love blowing their cover, and I'm going to be there blowing your cover
[1:36:58.160 --> 1:37:00.160]  again, scum.
[1:37:00.160 --> 1:37:04.720]  Also, they can stomp on my First Amendment.
[1:37:04.720 --> 1:37:06.480]  Tom in New Jersey, you're on the air.
[1:37:06.480 --> 1:37:07.480]  Welcome to the airwaves worldwide.
[1:37:07.480 --> 1:37:08.480]  How are you?
[1:37:08.480 --> 1:37:09.480]  How are you?
[1:37:09.480 --> 1:37:10.480]  Good.
[1:37:10.480 --> 1:37:11.480]  You're on the air.
[1:37:11.480 --> 1:37:12.480]  Go ahead, sir.
[1:37:12.480 --> 1:37:14.720]  Yeah, you know who I am, but I'll tell you later.
[1:37:14.720 --> 1:37:18.480]  Listen, the National Security Strategy Document, are you familiar with that, Alex?
[1:37:18.480 --> 1:37:19.480]  Yes.
[1:37:19.480 --> 1:37:21.480]  I don't think most of America knows about it.
[1:37:21.480 --> 1:37:25.120]  September 2007, it was passed by the British administration.
[1:37:25.120 --> 1:37:32.400]  A document that defines how the US will interact with international communities and being unilateral
[1:37:32.400 --> 1:37:37.120]  in nature, which means it'll go in and do whatever it wants to do.
[1:37:37.120 --> 1:37:40.400]  And preempt and nuke whoever they want and everything else.
[1:37:40.400 --> 1:37:41.400]  Totally criminal.
[1:37:41.400 --> 1:37:46.880]  And by the way, Barack Obama has put out a policy report that mirrors it all, attacking
[1:37:46.880 --> 1:37:47.880]  it.
[1:37:47.880 --> 1:37:48.880]  No difference.
[1:37:48.880 --> 1:37:52.880]  And the left suddenly is going, yeah, war, yeah, yeah, we like it.
[1:37:52.880 --> 1:37:56.800]  We're starting to strut around going, I like war.
[1:37:56.800 --> 1:37:57.800]  I'm sorry.
[1:37:57.800 --> 1:37:58.800]  Go ahead.
[1:37:58.800 --> 1:38:01.400]  And they're going to be operating outside the boundary of international law, and they're
[1:38:01.400 --> 1:38:03.400]  saying that they're going to be interacting.
[1:38:03.400 --> 1:38:07.480]  Well, where does the word interaction come in with unilateral?
[1:38:07.480 --> 1:38:09.480]  It doesn't make any sense.
[1:38:09.480 --> 1:38:11.000]  It's like double talk.
[1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:12.000]  Things.
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:13.000]  It's all criminal.
[1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:14.000]  It is criminal.
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:17.920]  Sir, sir, the global leaders are in Bohemian Grove right now with thousands of gay porn
[1:38:17.920 --> 1:38:18.920]  stars.
[1:38:18.920 --> 1:38:20.520]  I mean, I mean, that's mainstream news.
[1:38:20.520 --> 1:38:21.520]  We want to puke.
[1:38:21.520 --> 1:38:24.240]  Well, I mean, the point is that's your Christian conservative leaders.
[1:38:24.240 --> 1:38:25.240]  It's totally fake.
[1:38:25.240 --> 1:38:28.280]  I mean, it's totally fake, totally fake.
[1:38:28.280 --> 1:38:29.280]  American power.
[1:38:29.280 --> 1:38:30.640]  And it's it makes me sick to my stuff.
[1:38:30.640 --> 1:38:32.760]  It's just like Rome, folks.
[1:38:32.760 --> 1:38:36.560]  I mean, I mean, I mean, again, I'm not kidding.
[1:38:36.560 --> 1:38:37.560]  Let's not exaggerate.
[1:38:37.560 --> 1:38:42.440]  It is admitted that as many as a thousand female prostitutes are brought in just for
[1:38:42.440 --> 1:38:45.640]  the two surrounding towns, Monterio and Occidental.
[1:38:45.640 --> 1:38:47.680]  They just fill them with prostitutes.
[1:38:47.680 --> 1:38:49.040]  I've been there during the event.
[1:38:49.040 --> 1:38:53.800]  I mean, there's just, you know, six foot blondes and brunettes walking around everywhere
[1:38:53.800 --> 1:38:59.240]  outside the camp, jets landing, this gorging male prostitutes worldwide.
[1:38:59.240 --> 1:39:00.760]  So we don't know the numbers inside.
[1:39:00.760 --> 1:39:04.760]  Just mainstream news reports that their valets are gay porn stars.
[1:39:04.760 --> 1:39:07.680]  I mean, that's where Bush and all of them go.
[1:39:07.680 --> 1:39:08.680]  It's right in front of you.
[1:39:08.680 --> 1:39:10.440]  They're just laughing at you.
[1:39:10.440 --> 1:39:13.120]  Remember Jeff Gannon, the gay porn star in the White House?
[1:39:13.120 --> 1:39:14.640]  Oh, yes, I remember that.
[1:39:14.640 --> 1:39:17.440]  I mean, I mean, again, I'm not even bashing, quote, gay people here.
[1:39:17.440 --> 1:39:19.800]  The whole point is this is how decadent it is.
[1:39:19.800 --> 1:39:20.800]  Yeah.
[1:39:20.800 --> 1:39:24.960]  I mean, Richard Nixon, do you know the Richard Nixon quote about the orgies they have in
[1:39:24.960 --> 1:39:25.960]  there?
[1:39:25.960 --> 1:39:26.960]  Oh, yeah.
[1:39:26.960 --> 1:39:29.400]  He was, he was, I think he made a remark that he would never return.
[1:39:29.400 --> 1:39:30.400]  Did he not?
[1:39:30.400 --> 1:39:31.400]  Yeah, we can't say it on air.
[1:39:31.400 --> 1:39:32.400]  You can go listen to it.
[1:39:32.400 --> 1:39:36.800]  He's always in Harper's, but not published, and the Harper's writer wrote a book about
[1:39:36.800 --> 1:39:40.280]  it in the 90s after he died and people didn't believe it.
[1:39:40.280 --> 1:39:45.320]  And so then what happened was they went ahead to Harper's three years ago, released the
[1:39:45.320 --> 1:39:46.320]  tape.
[1:39:46.320 --> 1:39:47.320]  We can't play it here.
[1:39:47.320 --> 1:39:51.240]  There's so much gding and effing and, you know, but the point is he talks about it all.
[1:39:51.240 --> 1:39:55.200]  Just, you know, just, just huge satanic homosexual orgies.
[1:39:55.200 --> 1:40:00.080]  I mean, that's your leaders, folks, and they got neutron bombs, nerve gas helicopters waiting
[1:40:00.080 --> 1:40:01.080]  for you.
[1:40:01.080 --> 1:40:02.560]  All brainwashing.
[1:40:02.560 --> 1:40:03.560]  Anything else, sir?
[1:40:03.560 --> 1:40:06.560]  Yeah, I did want to touch on Harp for a moment.
[1:40:06.560 --> 1:40:10.520]  I was going to sleep the other night and I was just flicking through the TV and I passed
[1:40:10.520 --> 1:40:16.680]  Superman three and it was amazing how they were explaining Harp back in 1983 on Superman
[1:40:16.680 --> 1:40:21.960]  three, taking over the Colombian coffee crops, which blew my mind.
[1:40:21.960 --> 1:40:24.680]  They throw it all in your face, sir.
[1:40:24.680 --> 1:40:28.200]  Well, listen, listen, Mayor Ray Nagan.
[1:40:28.200 --> 1:40:29.200]  The Audi, correct?
[1:40:29.200 --> 1:40:30.200]  Yes.
[1:40:30.200 --> 1:40:35.240]  The Mayor Ray Nagan starred in Oil Storm that aired six months before, where an exact hurricane
[1:40:35.240 --> 1:40:38.400]  hits and the exact same thing happens in New Orleans.
[1:40:38.400 --> 1:40:40.160]  Which movie was that?
[1:40:40.160 --> 1:40:41.160]  Oil Storm on FX.
[1:40:41.160 --> 1:40:42.160]  Oil Storm.
[1:40:42.160 --> 1:40:48.560]  I mean, the Mayor starred in his own movie, just like Fox TV.
[1:40:48.560 --> 1:40:53.320]  And then I had the star of the show, the lone gunman, and X file show up at my door.
[1:40:53.320 --> 1:40:58.880]  I mean, I mean, it's on the web, Dean Haglin, he said, yeah, the CIA approached us and planted
[1:40:58.880 --> 1:41:02.120]  those stories on us and I want to tell you, I'm freaked out.
[1:41:02.120 --> 1:41:05.960]  He called Chris Carter on the day of 9-11 and said, what is this and what happens in
[1:41:05.960 --> 1:41:06.960]  that episode?
[1:41:06.960 --> 1:41:11.440]  A hijacked jet by remote control to be flown to the World Trade Center to be blamed on
[1:41:11.440 --> 1:41:14.600]  Afghanistan to launch this new war on terror.
[1:41:14.600 --> 1:41:18.600]  And it's really a group in the military doing it and they're doing it and they use a drill
[1:41:18.600 --> 1:41:21.240]  to make the rest of NORAD stand out.
[1:41:21.240 --> 1:41:23.640]  The exactly what happened on 9-11.
[1:41:23.640 --> 1:41:24.640]  Wow.
[1:41:24.640 --> 1:41:26.760]  That's incredible.
[1:41:26.760 --> 1:41:27.760]  It's unbelievable.
[1:41:27.760 --> 1:41:29.800]  You've got hundreds of examples of this.
[1:41:29.800 --> 1:41:30.800]  Yeah.
[1:41:30.800 --> 1:41:36.880]  And I really appreciate you doing what you're doing and I thank you and everybody about
[1:41:36.880 --> 1:41:37.880]  this show.
[1:41:37.880 --> 1:41:38.880]  Okay, Alex.
[1:41:38.880 --> 1:41:39.880]  Well, God bless you, my friend.
[1:41:39.880 --> 1:41:40.880]  I appreciate it.
[1:41:40.880 --> 1:41:41.880]  Yeah.
[1:41:41.880 --> 1:41:48.400]  For those that don't know, Dean Haglin, a star of X files and lone gunman, Paul looks
[1:41:48.400 --> 1:41:49.400]  completely flipped out in there.
[1:41:49.400 --> 1:41:53.000]  Yeah, Paul, Google Dean Haglin, Alex Jones, go to YouTube.
[1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:54.960]  Let's play people when we come back a minute or two of it.
[1:41:54.960 --> 1:41:56.600]  I mean, there's hundreds of versions of it.
[1:41:56.600 --> 1:41:58.440]  It's originally on prisonplanet.tv.
[1:41:58.440 --> 1:42:00.040]  I did two different interviews.
[1:42:00.040 --> 1:42:02.440]  He came to town and interviewed him at my house.
[1:42:02.440 --> 1:42:05.440]  I got a call and it's like, this is Dean Haglin.
[1:42:05.440 --> 1:42:08.800]  And I'm like, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, this is Dean Haglin.
[1:42:08.800 --> 1:42:10.960]  I said, well, why don't you come, you know, if you're coming into town, come on by my
[1:42:10.960 --> 1:42:11.960]  house, I'll interview you.
[1:42:11.960 --> 1:42:14.680]  So he sat right there in my office and I videotaped it.
[1:42:14.680 --> 1:42:16.960]  And then about a year later, he came back, this was a couple of years ago, came back
[1:42:16.960 --> 1:42:20.000]  in Austin, sat in studio.
[1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:24.080]  And the CIA approached them and said, we want you to put this stuff in your plot because
[1:42:24.080 --> 1:42:28.000]  it's part of a victory dance, criminals love to celebrate.
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:30.000]  It's letting you know, yes, we murdered you.
[1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:32.000]  We're going to keep murdering you.
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:35.080]  We're going to hurt you real bad and you're going to like it.
[1:42:35.080 --> 1:42:36.080]  Okay.
[1:42:36.080 --> 1:42:37.080]  All right.
[1:42:37.080 --> 1:42:40.880]  We're going to murder you because we are your gods.
[1:42:40.880 --> 1:42:43.560]  Prisonplanet.com, our new film, Truth Rising is out.

[1:42:53.680 --> 1:42:56.040]  Are you concerned about your personal safety?
[1:42:56.040 --> 1:42:59.640]  Why wait for something bad to happen when you can take action now?

[1:43:50.000 --> 1:43:51.000]  Hey, everybody.
[1:43:51.000 --> 1:43:53.280]  If you're anything like me, I'll bet you like to eat.
[1:43:53.280 --> 1:44:00.280]  I like egg scrambles for breakfast, fresh homemade bread, delicious pastas like lasagna,
[1:44:00.280 --> 1:44:06.240]  I love beef stroganoff, I love chicken noodle soup, I love desserts, all kinds of entrees
[1:44:06.240 --> 1:44:08.640]  and soups and desserts and breakfast.
[1:44:08.640 --> 1:44:09.640]  I love that stuff.
[1:44:09.640 --> 1:44:13.120]  Now, food prices are skyrocketing just like gasoline prices.
[1:44:13.120 --> 1:44:17.360]  I mean, the gasoline prices have gone insanely high, probably going to go higher.
[1:44:17.360 --> 1:44:19.320]  Food prices are right on their heels.
[1:44:19.320 --> 1:44:20.800]  How are people going to be able to afford to eat?
[1:44:20.800 --> 1:44:25.920]  Well, I found a way to buy really incredible foods like I just described at half the price
[1:44:25.920 --> 1:44:27.720]  of last year's grocery bill.
[1:44:27.720 --> 1:44:31.560]  For less than half of what you spent for the same amount of food last year, I can have
[1:44:31.560 --> 1:44:33.600]  it delivered to your door.

[1:44:47.760 --> 1:44:53.560]  Cut those food costs now.
[1:44:53.560 --> 1:44:58.240]  Last month, Ready Reserve Foods stated that by fall, food would be in short supply and
[1:44:58.240 --> 1:45:02.480]  the government would be forced to impose controls on food and food distribution because of civil
[1:45:02.480 --> 1:45:04.040]  unrest and panic.
[1:45:04.040 --> 1:45:08.520]  Well, the floods in the heartland of America have all but assured this will happen.
[1:45:08.520 --> 1:45:13.720]  It is estimated that 5 million acres of farmland will not be producing over 700 million bushels
[1:45:13.720 --> 1:45:15.360]  of corn alone.
[1:45:15.360 --> 1:45:19.760]  If you have ever thought about storing food, now is the time to do so.
[1:45:19.760 --> 1:45:26.320]  Paul Ready Reserve Foods at 1-800-453-2202 for a free catalog, Larry Matlack, president
[1:45:26.320 --> 1:45:31.600]  of the American Agriculture Movement, stated on June 6 that the USDA has only enough wheat
[1:45:31.600 --> 1:45:35.040]  stored to make one half of a loaf of bread for every American.
[1:45:35.040 --> 1:45:45.480]  Visit us on the web at readyreservefoods.com 1-800-453-2202, that's 1-800-453-2202.

[1:45:54.840 --> 1:45:59.600]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[1:45:59.600 --> 1:46:00.600]  Hi, folks.
[1:46:00.600 --> 1:46:01.600]  I'm John Jones here.

[1:46:52.680 --> 1:47:06.160]  This is the GCN Radio Network, home to hard hitting talk radio.
[1:47:06.160 --> 1:47:16.760]  I just Googled Dean Haglin slash Alex Jones and we didn't have time to cut into the exact
[1:47:16.760 --> 1:47:20.080]  area we were talking about, the CIA planting plots on them.
[1:47:20.080 --> 1:47:26.880]  Since I brought it up, and again this is just audio here on the radio but on the web, it's
[1:47:26.880 --> 1:47:35.800]  video of the interview I did with him at my house so the audio is not the best.
[1:47:35.800 --> 1:47:38.000]  I didn't put wireless mics on him.
[1:47:38.000 --> 1:47:41.560]  Here go ahead and roll it, roll a little bit of it.
[1:47:41.560 --> 1:47:47.800]  The popularity of the gun had a large conspiracy contingent to it and so they were going after
[1:47:47.800 --> 1:47:54.520]  that fan base and less from the shippers and who loved the Muldern, who loved Scully kind
[1:47:54.520 --> 1:47:55.520]  of thing.
[1:47:55.520 --> 1:47:58.640]  Your pilot episode, tell us about that plot.
[1:47:58.640 --> 1:47:59.640]  Yeah, absolutely.
[1:47:59.640 --> 1:48:06.640]  This was a pilot episode for the lone gunman where the basic plot was the gunman had to
[1:48:06.640 --> 1:48:12.520]  stop a plane from flying into the World Trade Center eight months before it actually happened.
[1:48:12.520 --> 1:48:17.840]  So when we got the script it said, you know, plane, World Trade Center, they filmed an
[1:48:17.840 --> 1:48:24.280]  entire airplane, they had a green map screen so they put the shot of the New York skyline
[1:48:24.280 --> 1:48:29.480]  in with the plane flying directly at it and just seconds before we get computer control
[1:48:29.480 --> 1:48:33.400]  we get it back to the pilots and the pilots can pull the plane up and avoid hitting the
[1:48:33.400 --> 1:48:34.680]  World Trade Center.
[1:48:34.680 --> 1:48:40.160]  And part of that plot was that, as it said in the script, that this was to start an international
[1:48:40.160 --> 1:48:44.840]  war on terror, that this was, you know, the Cold War is over and that shows almost over.
[1:48:44.840 --> 1:48:47.520]  I want to take some calls and respect the callers.
[1:48:47.520 --> 1:48:48.520]  Next week I'm going to take a lot of calls, folks.
[1:48:48.520 --> 1:48:52.240]  I just had to cover all that police state news.
[1:48:52.240 --> 1:48:53.840]  It almost lessens the severity of it.
[1:48:53.840 --> 1:48:58.680]  We just commonly report all mass graves, mass coffins, crematoriums for the public, mainstream
[1:48:58.680 --> 1:49:03.680]  news, youth brigades, warrantless checkpoints, National Guard doing gun confiscations in
[1:49:03.680 --> 1:49:10.680]  America, in Illinois, but then Dean Haglin gets into how the CIA planted a bunch of plots
[1:49:10.680 --> 1:49:13.680]  on them.
[1:49:13.680 --> 1:49:18.400]  Let's go ahead and go to, well, somebody disagrees here, but I got to hurry, Hal, because I want
[1:49:18.400 --> 1:49:21.320]  to get to Joyce and Chris and everybody else.
[1:49:21.320 --> 1:49:23.920]  Hal in Oregon, head of the line, go ahead.
[1:49:23.920 --> 1:49:25.400]  Thank you, Alex.
[1:49:25.400 --> 1:49:29.600]  I just wanted to respond to something that you and Mark Korenke were talking about last
[1:49:29.600 --> 1:49:36.040]  time about the national park system, he had made a comment that the national parks were
[1:49:36.040 --> 1:49:41.000]  hocked to the IMF and I was wanting to call to tell you, I don't believe that Congress
[1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:46.640]  could hock to the IMF what it granted to the American citizen back then.
[1:49:46.640 --> 1:49:47.640]  Well, they did, sir.
[1:49:47.640 --> 1:49:50.200]  I mean, it's been, it's been in the international agreements.
[1:49:50.200 --> 1:49:53.880]  I mean, Congress, Bush isn't supposed to declare that Congress isn't involved in
[1:49:53.880 --> 1:49:56.440]  continuity of government, but it is.
[1:49:56.440 --> 1:49:58.840]  I mean, there's all sorts of things now.
[1:49:58.840 --> 1:49:59.840]  I mean, here's an example.
[1:49:59.840 --> 1:50:05.080]  The head of Northcom signed an agreement to use Canadian and NATO troops inside the U.S.
[1:50:05.080 --> 1:50:09.520]  two months ago, three months ago to quote, fight terrorists, and Congress flipped out
[1:50:09.520 --> 1:50:11.200]  and said, we didn't authorize that.
[1:50:11.200 --> 1:50:15.120]  I mean, before, Congress had to commission all officers because you couldn't have one
[1:50:15.120 --> 1:50:17.040]  branch of government controlling the military.
[1:50:17.040 --> 1:50:22.080]  Now they've got giant Merck forces, mercenaries, I mean, it's all just lawless evils, sir.
[1:50:22.080 --> 1:50:23.280]  Alex, I understand all that.
[1:50:23.280 --> 1:50:25.480]  It's not that I'm even disagreeing with you on that part.
[1:50:25.480 --> 1:50:28.960]  I'm telling, I'm saying that when you research the law out about this, and I have done this
[1:50:28.960 --> 1:50:29.960]  very, very well.
[1:50:29.960 --> 1:50:31.600]  Oh, it's fraudulent that they've handed the country over, yes.
[1:50:31.600 --> 1:50:35.480]  Well, it's not, well, the thing I'm saying is that it has not yet been challenged at
[1:50:35.480 --> 1:50:36.480]  that point.
[1:50:36.480 --> 1:50:40.600]  And I guess my, my contention was, my contention was that by making a comment for people to
[1:50:40.600 --> 1:50:46.480]  hear that almost gives into that position was a vile, it kind of violated my senses
[1:50:46.480 --> 1:50:49.920]  because I know after doing the research that when a proper argument comes forward, and
[1:50:49.920 --> 1:50:52.680]  I'm saying that there's a judiciary here that can actually hear this.
[1:50:52.680 --> 1:50:56.280]  So it was a fraudulent conveyance and you're absolutely right.
[1:50:56.280 --> 1:51:00.200]  They don't really own all our national parks and millions of other acres, but they have
[1:51:00.200 --> 1:51:02.960]  armed people that believe they do.
[1:51:02.960 --> 1:51:07.720]  And if you ever try to take the parks back from America, they will engage you militarily.
[1:51:07.720 --> 1:51:09.000]  And that's why we call it tyranny.
[1:51:09.000 --> 1:51:10.960]  You're absolutely right, sir.
[1:51:10.960 --> 1:51:11.960]  You are correct.
[1:51:11.960 --> 1:51:12.960]  Okay.
[1:51:12.960 --> 1:51:15.360]  Our point is they say it's theirs, but you're right.
[1:51:15.360 --> 1:51:16.800]  They can say it on a second amendment.
[1:51:16.800 --> 1:51:18.280]  I still do.
[1:51:18.280 --> 1:51:20.400]  Joyce in Wisconsin, you're on the air.
[1:51:20.400 --> 1:51:21.400]  Hi.
[1:51:21.400 --> 1:51:26.120]  This is Joyce and I can't quite match your power, but I can tell you that I've been
[1:51:26.120 --> 1:51:29.080]  preaching this stuff for 30 years, door to door.
[1:51:29.080 --> 1:51:31.360]  Nobody had listened to me.
[1:51:31.360 --> 1:51:36.560]  And the organization I was preaching with, which was Jehovah's Witnesses, has also sold
[1:51:36.560 --> 1:51:37.560]  out to the U.N.
[1:51:37.560 --> 1:51:39.400]  They sold out to Rand.
[1:51:39.400 --> 1:51:44.520]  They own 51%, they own 51% of Rand Corporation.
[1:51:44.520 --> 1:51:48.040]  They're just as evil as all the other churches out there.
[1:51:48.040 --> 1:51:49.040]  That's what I was going to say, ma'am.
[1:51:49.040 --> 1:51:55.160]  Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, I mean, any mainline group, 26,000 preachers.
[1:51:55.160 --> 1:51:56.920]  Now, we told you this when it was secret.
[1:51:56.920 --> 1:52:01.960]  Now it's admitted, we're secretly paid and tell their flocks to submit to government,
[1:52:01.960 --> 1:52:06.360]  go to camps, take shots, worship government, render on the Caesar, Romans 13.
[1:52:06.360 --> 1:52:07.360]  So absolutely.
[1:52:07.360 --> 1:52:13.040]  I mean, you know, the Catholics, the Baptists, the Jehovah's Witnesses, the Seventh-day Adventists,
[1:52:13.040 --> 1:52:18.840]  not all the branches, but I mean, major branches of all these groups are under New World Order
[1:52:18.840 --> 1:52:20.320]  control right now.
[1:52:20.320 --> 1:52:22.360]  They are.
[1:52:22.360 --> 1:52:23.360]  People don't do it.
[1:52:23.360 --> 1:52:24.480]  They don't want to believe it.
[1:52:24.480 --> 1:52:25.480]  It's frustrating.
[1:52:25.480 --> 1:52:30.800]  We tell people every day to buy food, to store food, to get some water because if they don't,
[1:52:30.800 --> 1:52:33.200]  they could be locked in their house and they're going to die.
[1:52:33.200 --> 1:52:34.440]  They don't listen.
[1:52:34.440 --> 1:52:36.280]  Every day I go out and drive professionally.
[1:52:36.280 --> 1:52:41.920]  I see people getting pulled over by cops and nobody seems to alarm every day.
[1:52:41.920 --> 1:52:42.920]  I hear you without...
[1:52:42.920 --> 1:52:45.800]  Well, look, they've only doubled, tripled, quadrupled, and more of the police and they
[1:52:45.800 --> 1:52:48.280]  got to raise money and it's just going to get worse and worse.
[1:52:48.280 --> 1:52:51.480]  No economy with more and more bureaucrats sucking off of you.
[1:52:51.480 --> 1:52:53.880]  Folks, you want to be slaves, you're going to get to be now.
[1:52:53.880 --> 1:52:54.880]  Okay?
[1:52:54.880 --> 1:52:56.880]  And that goes for all the people in government.
[1:52:56.880 --> 1:52:58.680]  Your families are going to be hurt, too.
[1:52:58.680 --> 1:53:02.040]  You wanted it, you get it.
[1:53:02.040 --> 1:53:03.040]  You wanted this.
[1:53:03.040 --> 1:53:04.200]  This is what you wanted.
[1:53:04.200 --> 1:53:06.320]  You wanted to lay around and deny the tyranny.
[1:53:06.320 --> 1:53:09.360]  Well, it's going to get worse and worse.
[1:53:09.360 --> 1:53:10.360]  Thank you.
[1:53:10.360 --> 1:53:11.360]  Let's talk to Chris.
[1:53:11.360 --> 1:53:12.360]  Chris, you're on the air.
[1:53:12.360 --> 1:53:13.360]  Welcome from Kentucky.
[1:53:13.360 --> 1:53:15.280]  Yeah, thanks, Alex.
[1:53:15.280 --> 1:53:19.640]  About a few weeks ago, the Kentucky State Police budget problems, of course the state
[1:53:19.640 --> 1:53:20.640]  had some problems.
[1:53:20.640 --> 1:53:22.320]  The feds are helping, aren't they?
[1:53:22.320 --> 1:53:23.320]  Yeah, they are.
[1:53:23.320 --> 1:53:27.360]  And you know, the gas was so expensive per gallon in Kentucky, so the idea was, I heard
[1:53:27.360 --> 1:53:28.360]  this newscast.
[1:53:28.360 --> 1:53:31.240]  They said, why don't they save gas by having checkpoints?
[1:53:31.240 --> 1:53:32.240]  Here we go.
[1:53:32.240 --> 1:53:33.240]  Here's tyranny.
[1:53:33.240 --> 1:53:34.240]  It's building...
[1:53:34.240 --> 1:53:37.120]  That way we can just randomly check to save money.
[1:53:37.120 --> 1:53:38.640]  How about we just put everybody in prison?
[1:53:38.640 --> 1:53:39.640]  Yeah.
[1:53:39.640 --> 1:53:42.960]  How about everybody just live in a prison and we let you out during the day to work?
[1:53:42.960 --> 1:53:45.120]  That's what America is turning into.
[1:53:45.120 --> 1:53:46.600]  That is the government plan.
[1:53:46.600 --> 1:53:50.320]  Folks, I'm telling you, if you don't wake up and you have that free right to travel,
[1:53:50.320 --> 1:53:51.920]  you're going to be cooked if you don't wake up.
[1:53:51.920 --> 1:53:53.440]  The Houston airport just put it in.
[1:53:53.440 --> 1:53:55.040]  They're going to put it in every major airport.
[1:53:55.040 --> 1:53:58.240]  And when I go out of the Austin airport or anywhere else, I am not going to walk through
[1:53:58.240 --> 1:54:01.720]  the naked pick-a-boo machine where they scan your naked body and put it in a database
[1:54:01.720 --> 1:54:02.720]  and laugh at you.
[1:54:02.720 --> 1:54:03.720]  Yeah.
[1:54:03.720 --> 1:54:04.720]  Exactly.
[1:54:04.720 --> 1:54:05.720]  I mean, it's just totally...
[1:54:05.720 --> 1:54:07.360]  I'm not wearing a taser bracelet.
[1:54:07.360 --> 1:54:08.640]  It's over, criminals.
[1:54:08.640 --> 1:54:10.380]  We know you carried out the attacks.
[1:54:10.380 --> 1:54:13.120]  We know you want us to be your slaves and it isn't going to work.
[1:54:13.120 --> 1:54:14.120]  No, it's not.
[1:54:14.120 --> 1:54:15.120]  And I'm just...
[1:54:15.120 --> 1:54:16.120]  Jigs up, murderers.
[1:54:16.120 --> 1:54:17.120]  Anything else, Chris?
[1:54:17.120 --> 1:54:21.920]  Yeah, I just also want to say that the Melly's Tavern Entertainment Place put in thumb scanners
[1:54:21.920 --> 1:54:23.640]  and also DUI machines.
[1:54:23.640 --> 1:54:26.480]  It's just a database to set up in there.
[1:54:26.480 --> 1:54:28.800]  They already did it, but it's for everybody's sake.
[1:54:28.800 --> 1:54:29.800]  Everything's a database.
[1:54:29.800 --> 1:54:30.800]  Exactly.
[1:54:30.800 --> 1:54:31.800]  And it isn't about stopping drunk driving.
[1:54:31.800 --> 1:54:34.640]  It's all about getting you trained to be slaves.
[1:54:34.640 --> 1:54:37.960]  Metal detectors are now in some cities going to be on the streets randomly.
[1:54:37.960 --> 1:54:39.280]  Just total control.
[1:54:39.280 --> 1:54:41.520]  The criminal government is coming.
[1:54:41.520 --> 1:54:46.880]  And remember, because they ran out our credit, they bought the world, they bought real assets,
[1:54:46.880 --> 1:54:51.640]  and now they're devaluing the dollar by design to come in and buy up what's left.
[1:54:51.640 --> 1:54:53.880]  This is total dominance.
[1:54:53.880 --> 1:54:55.600]  And folks are freaking out about Anheuser-Busch.
[1:54:55.600 --> 1:54:57.960]  Folks, it's all foreign.
[1:54:57.960 --> 1:54:58.960]  Everything.
[1:54:58.960 --> 1:55:01.240]  Halliburton's offshore.
[1:55:01.240 --> 1:55:05.240]  Blackwater USA isn't based in the U.S. Everything's leaving.
[1:55:05.240 --> 1:55:08.920]  Ford is moving most of its plants to Mexico.
[1:55:08.920 --> 1:55:12.920]  We're saying, all the big companies are saying, you're not getting your pensions, or you're
[1:55:12.920 --> 1:55:15.880]  not getting your health care, or we're going to cut them.
[1:55:15.880 --> 1:55:20.760]  I mean, it's just, it's all happening because they know we're smucks.
[1:55:20.760 --> 1:55:26.880]  They know we're cowardly slaves who've been so fat and happy so long, and they tested
[1:55:26.880 --> 1:55:31.320]  us and we put up with them burning churches at Waco and padlocking churches at Indian
[1:55:31.320 --> 1:55:37.520]  Apples, Indiana, and we put up with them abortions and we put up with, I mean, Texas Youth Commission
[1:55:37.520 --> 1:55:40.760]  raping children in every facility, hardly anyone's gotten in trouble.
[1:55:40.760 --> 1:55:42.320]  That's in the paper today.
[1:55:42.320 --> 1:55:45.040]  Then you know what the criminals said, let's go for gusto.
[1:55:45.040 --> 1:55:47.240]  These smucks are born to take it.
[1:55:47.240 --> 1:55:50.480]  Let's take everything, just like they do in every other country.
[1:55:50.480 --> 1:55:53.000]  And so now you're going to get to have it, folks.
[1:55:53.000 --> 1:55:55.480]  Now you're going to get to really have what you want.
[1:55:55.480 --> 1:55:59.760]  Now you're going to get to get to have a bunch of military thugs in police uniforms, have
[1:55:59.760 --> 1:56:02.160]  their way with you like never before.
[1:56:02.160 --> 1:56:03.360]  Anything else, Chris?
[1:56:03.360 --> 1:56:05.360]  Yeah, and that's what the exact, you're exactly right.
[1:56:05.360 --> 1:56:08.160]  The military is going to be beefed up at the next Kentucky Derby next year.
[1:56:08.160 --> 1:56:09.160]  They're already talking about it.
[1:56:09.160 --> 1:56:10.520]  It's all brainwashing to see troops.
[1:56:10.520 --> 1:56:14.480]  It has nothing to do with the real, quote, terrorists happen to exist, like leprechauns
[1:56:14.480 --> 1:56:19.920]  or the Maltese Falcon was really flapping around from Pluto, you know, imaginary bull.
[1:56:19.920 --> 1:56:21.120]  Somebody would just drive a truck in there.
[1:56:21.120 --> 1:56:22.120]  That isn't how it works.
[1:56:22.120 --> 1:56:23.720]  It's about training you.
[1:56:23.720 --> 1:56:28.000]  All over the country, they have the guard out, confiscating guns very quietly.
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:29.320]  This is your new America.
[1:56:29.320 --> 1:56:30.960]  This is the cesspit.
[1:56:30.960 --> 1:56:33.560]  You think you get to laugh at the Iraqis and kill them?
[1:56:33.560 --> 1:56:35.640]  You get to live like an Iraqi now.
[1:56:35.640 --> 1:56:37.400]  You think the globalists just hate the Iraqis?
[1:56:37.400 --> 1:56:38.640]  They hate you too.
[1:56:38.640 --> 1:56:43.200]  They hate you even more because you used to fight the New World Order America.
[1:56:43.200 --> 1:56:46.640]  You used to be the only country that wouldn't go along with them.
[1:56:46.640 --> 1:56:48.560]  I can't believe we've fallen into this.
[1:56:48.560 --> 1:56:51.680]  I can't believe this is what we've turned into.
[1:56:51.680 --> 1:56:54.960]  And I'm mad because, Chris, we could turn it all around today.
[1:56:54.960 --> 1:56:57.120]  It's not too late, but it's almost too late.
[1:56:57.120 --> 1:57:00.400]  It's almost too late, but I am just as mad as you are because it's just, I'm not free
[1:57:00.400 --> 1:57:01.400]  out here.
[1:57:01.400 --> 1:57:02.920]  It looks like a stisey environment out here.
[1:57:02.920 --> 1:57:05.000]  Well, it hasn't even begun.
[1:57:05.000 --> 1:57:06.000]  It hasn't even begun.
[1:57:06.000 --> 1:57:10.080]  I'm sorry, but I can't get to the rest of your calls back live next Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[1:57:10.080 --> 1:57:13.240]  Weekday shows on, of course, infowars.com.
[1:57:13.240 --> 1:57:17.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're out of here.
[1:57:17.480 --> 1:57:18.480]  Everything I've told you is true.
[1:57:18.480 --> 1:57:22.600]  This is how a normal person responds when they know there's total tyranny coming down
[1:57:22.600 --> 1:57:26.600]  on the beautiful United States of America and worldwide.
[1:57:26.600 --> 1:57:28.240]  And the whole world, you better worry.
[1:57:28.240 --> 1:57:33.000]  They plan to bring us down and use us as an engine to take you down.
[1:57:33.000 --> 1:57:34.000]  God bless you all.
[1:57:34.000 --> 1:57:41.560]  Get truth rising on DVD at infowars.com and get it out.
[1:57:41.560 --> 1:57:44.520]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[1:57:44.520 --> 1:57:47.080]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[1:57:47.080 --> 1:57:50.240]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[1:57:50.240 --> 1:57:56.280]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its
[1:57:56.280 --> 1:57:58.200]  purchasing power.
[1:57:58.200 --> 1:58:00.720]  Find your answer at Mitus Resources.

[1:58:39.200 --> 1:58:43.000]  Oh, what a beautiful day for the beach.
[1:58:43.000 --> 1:58:47.560]  Look, up there in the sky, it's Non-X-Man.
[1:58:47.560 --> 1:58:48.560]  He's in a dive.
[1:58:48.560 --> 1:58:51.800]  He must have found some ugly toenails on the beach.
[1:58:51.800 --> 1:58:52.800]  Let's go look.
[1:58:52.800 --> 1:58:56.920]  I'm Non-X-Man, and your toenails need Non-X nail gel.
[1:58:56.920 --> 1:58:58.720]  Stop hiding them in the sand.
[1:58:58.720 --> 1:58:59.720]  Take them out.
[1:58:59.720 --> 1:59:00.720]  Let's see them.
[1:59:00.720 --> 1:59:05.120]  Oh, I'm so embarrassed.
[1:59:05.120 --> 1:59:06.120]  Don't worry.
[1:59:06.120 --> 1:59:07.920]  Now there's Non-X nail gel.
[1:59:07.920 --> 1:59:12.320]  Use it on your toenails regularly, and they'll look fantastic in sandals.
[1:59:12.320 --> 1:59:15.120]  Oh, I will, Non-X-Man.
[1:59:15.120 --> 1:59:16.120]  Great.
[1:59:16.120 --> 1:59:19.920]  Well, I'm off to find more ugly toenails.
[1:59:19.920 --> 1:59:24.280]  Don't let Non-X-Man find you with unsightly toenails.
[1:59:24.280 --> 1:59:28.280]  My diabetic-friendly, money-back-guaranteed Non-X nail gel.
[1:59:28.280 --> 1:59:34.760]  It's in the foot care aisle at Supercenters, Walgreens, CVS, Lawns, Meyer, Giant Eagle,
[1:59:34.760 --> 1:59:45.320]  Car Drug, Sniders, Dwayne Reed, Bylo, and Rite Aid.
[1:59:45.320 --> 1:59:53.840]  You are listening to GCN.
