[00:00.000 --> 00:14.680]  It's Sunday, Part 6.
[00:14.680 --> 00:22.840]  Infowars, Tomorrow's News, Today.
[00:22.840 --> 00:31.520]  We will not comply with the institution's sick illusion.
[00:31.520 --> 00:41.000]  We won't be terrified, we're welcome to the revolution.
[00:41.000 --> 00:59.400]  We won't comply with the institution's sick illusion, we won't be terrified, we're welcome to the revolution.
[00:59.400 --> 01:02.160]  The revolution won't be televised, government been telling lies.
[01:02.160 --> 01:03.840]  If you're not with us, you better step aside.
[01:03.840 --> 01:06.000]  Witness in a genocide, everything is centralized.
[01:06.000 --> 01:08.400]  The food that we consume, when they spray it in our web, emphasize.
[01:08.400 --> 01:10.280]  Easily identify the sheep and the snake.
[01:10.280 --> 01:12.680]  The real and the fake, dip it as a reason to pray.
[01:12.680 --> 01:15.120]  I'm gonna make my own choices, a voice for the voiceless.
[01:15.120 --> 01:17.720]  They try to destroy us, avoid in the poison.
[01:17.720 --> 01:19.880]  It's all pointless if you don't have a purpose.
[01:19.880 --> 01:22.120]  If you're re-diverses, you'll know who we verse in.
[01:22.120 --> 01:25.000]  Government can tell you what you're worth, there's no deeper than the surface.
[01:25.000 --> 01:27.720]  They don't even want you researching, or asking questions.
[01:27.720 --> 01:31.280]  We all being tested, shh, shut your mouth, they comply, that's the message.
[01:31.280 --> 01:33.360]  Want you to rest on prescriptions, that's the message.
[01:33.360 --> 01:45.000]  The Soviet empire collapsed, and as the empire collapsed, I moved in and picked up the pieces.
[01:45.000 --> 01:58.320]  First in Hungary in 1984, and then Poland in 1987, China in 1987 as well.
[01:58.320 --> 02:10.480]  So this is how the Soros empire was replacing the Soviet empire.
[02:10.480 --> 02:14.840]  How do you think you're doing in your imperial ambitions?
[02:14.840 --> 02:22.640]  So George Soros, with US taxpayer money, has spent over $10 billion in the last 20 years
[02:22.640 --> 02:28.000]  in Ukraine for the overthrow they executed eight years ago.
[02:28.000 --> 02:31.680]  He went on CNN, he went on Bloomberg, we played both the clubs there, I'm not going to play
[02:31.680 --> 02:39.200]  him again today, and said that he quarterbacked the overthrowing of that, and intends to overthrow
[02:39.200 --> 02:47.360]  the Russian government, and Vladimir Putin have a leftist color revolution in Russia,
[02:47.360 --> 02:52.760]  and then use the bordering states that are not ethnically Russian to have an anti-Russian
[02:52.760 --> 02:59.360]  phobia, like you have an anti-white phobia here, being funded by Soros, and then break
[02:59.360 --> 03:03.360]  up Russia into at least four parts.
[03:03.360 --> 03:14.000]  That is his stated goal of the foundation he had with Fiona Hill, the open society foundation.
[03:14.000 --> 03:18.400]  And they said the operating system of the Caucasus in Eastern Europe and Russia will
[03:18.400 --> 03:25.960]  be transgenderism for men, and lesbian relationships for women.
[03:25.960 --> 03:29.960]  I don't dislike any of these people or groups of their adults that want to do things to themselves
[03:29.960 --> 03:34.520]  or drink Drano for that matter, or cut your penis off, that's your right, I'm a libertarian.
[03:34.520 --> 03:40.720]  But when you target children with it, it's evil, and this is really push the Russians
[03:40.720 --> 03:43.400]  over the edge.
[03:43.400 --> 03:46.720]  And the left tries to gaslight in the last few weeks of the articles, where I point out
[03:46.720 --> 03:52.160]  that Russia is enraged by this sexualization of children, the pedophilia, they of course
[03:52.160 --> 03:58.080]  have banned in a whole bunch of countries in Europe, Eastern Europe, including Russia,
[03:58.080 --> 04:03.200]  adopted children to Europe and the U.S. because so many end up being raped and murdered.
[04:03.200 --> 04:05.760]  I mean, look that up, that's a real thing.
[04:05.760 --> 04:09.120]  So they have Rolling Stone articles and others making fun of me about it, but then they had
[04:09.120 --> 04:15.440]  the head of MI6, they had the head of NATO, they had a bunch of U.S. senators and Soros
[04:15.440 --> 04:26.640]  all say the main mission is to turn Ukraine into LGBT, I mean they said, the LGBT part
[04:26.640 --> 04:28.280]  and the targeting of the children.
[04:28.280 --> 04:33.400]  So I know that sounds whacked out to say that's the ideology of the left, but that is the
[04:33.400 --> 04:34.400]  ideology.
[04:34.400 --> 04:39.440]  You realize how weaponized it is to get men to not marry women and vice versa and to castrate
[04:39.440 --> 04:43.080]  little boys or chemically castrate them, that's how you kill people.
[04:43.080 --> 04:46.760]  If they line you up and shoot you like what Soros helped do when he was a kid under the
[04:46.760 --> 04:51.280]  Nazis, people would fight back, but if they convinced your child with their five to have
[04:51.280 --> 04:55.120]  their balls chopped off in a couple of years and take away parental rights and a cult, they
[04:55.120 --> 05:01.480]  can terminate the child.
[05:01.480 --> 05:07.840]  It's hard to believe that we're already into March 2022 and in the month of February we
[05:07.840 --> 05:14.080]  had a very popular sale that was going of our flagship product X3 that has all three
[05:14.080 --> 05:20.640]  types of the amazing iodine your body needs for every electrochemical cellular activity
[05:20.640 --> 05:26.200]  in your body, your immune system, your stamina, your libido, so much and the majority of the
[05:26.200 --> 05:31.000]  population in the world is iodine deficient, this is the very best iodine out there.
[05:31.000 --> 05:35.960]  So we have on sale 50% off, but we sold more than half of what we have or isn't going to
[05:35.960 --> 05:40.240]  come in for a long time, so I took it back to full products and I was just thinking,
[05:40.240 --> 05:44.400]  you know what, we need the funds in now to stay on air, plus this is a great product
[05:44.400 --> 05:49.120]  everybody needs, so to incentivize folks out there that have been on the fence to get X3
[05:49.120 --> 05:53.560]  and experience it yourself and support the broadcast, I'm going to keep it at 50% off
[05:53.560 --> 05:55.320]  until it sells out.
[05:55.320 --> 06:11.960]  At X3 right now exclusively at InfowarsStore.com for 50% off.
[06:11.960 --> 06:18.560]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report, it's Alex Jones.
[06:18.560 --> 06:26.360]  Well, we've got a massive amount of key news and guests tonight on this live original Sunday,
[06:26.360 --> 06:30.160]  March 6, 2022, wartime broadcast.
[06:30.160 --> 06:35.800]  I am your host, Alex Jones, thank you so much for joining us, filmmaker, author, of course
[06:35.800 --> 06:42.640]  also the son of Oliver Stone, the friend of mine, Sean Stone, is an expert on Ukraine,
[06:42.640 --> 06:46.120]  an expert on Eastern Europe, he's written books about it, he's got a new book out on
[06:46.120 --> 06:51.440]  the global deep state and the New World Order, of course his father made several films about
[06:51.440 --> 06:56.360]  Ukraine and the Soros overthrow, and that is Ukraine burning in one other film, he'll
[06:56.360 --> 07:00.400]  be joining us in the second hour tonight.
[07:00.400 --> 07:04.560]  Long time Infowars reporter who then went to work the last few years at the blaze, Savannah
[07:04.560 --> 07:10.440]  Hernandez is now doing work with Truth Social and she is with the convoy that entered DC
[07:10.440 --> 07:16.480]  today but hasn't gotten all the way into the main area of the capital, the ceremonial areas,
[07:16.480 --> 07:22.240]  all the monuments because the traffic is so massive, the city is now completely, basically
[07:22.240 --> 07:27.480]  in gridlocks, we've got a lot of that coming up for you, she'll be popping in with us at
[07:27.480 --> 07:33.000]  the bottom of the hour and then tomorrow she will be joining us with live video feeds
[07:33.000 --> 07:34.680]  from DC.
[07:34.680 --> 07:38.040]  And by the way, Truth Social is now up and running, the bugs have been worked out and
[07:38.040 --> 07:42.720]  we're getting a lot of people following us over at the Alex Jones area at Truth Social
[07:42.720 --> 07:48.720]  so glad to see that Trump has gotten that open independent social media system launched,
[07:48.720 --> 07:50.720]  great job.
[07:50.720 --> 07:55.560]  Okay, speaking of Trump, when Trump's right, Trump's right, when he's wrong, he's wrong,
[07:55.560 --> 08:00.880]  we know he's a whole hell of a lot better than active globalist like Soros controlled,
[08:00.880 --> 08:06.200]  Bill Gates controlled Biden who's actively cutting off our energy, destroying our borders
[08:06.200 --> 08:12.120]  while still buying oil from Russia, how he squares that, well we'll lay that out coming
[08:12.120 --> 08:20.400]  up but first, I want to play a clip of Trump talking to a famous golfer and they had him
[08:20.400 --> 08:27.800]  on speakerphone, this just came out today and so they released it out on Instagram and YouTube
[08:27.800 --> 08:33.960]  and everywhere else, this is John Daly, the famous golfer and Trump talking about Russia
[08:33.960 --> 08:36.680]  and Putin and why is this important?
[08:36.680 --> 08:42.360]  The New York Post first reported weeks ago that Trump had threatened to nuke or attack
[08:42.360 --> 08:48.920]  Moscow and quote, blow up all those beautiful gold towers you've got there in Red Square
[08:48.920 --> 08:52.760]  if you attack Ukraine in any way.
[08:52.760 --> 08:54.260]  He reportedly also told G.G.
[08:54.260 --> 08:57.240]  Ping the same thing about Taiwan.
[08:57.240 --> 09:02.040]  Well now the National Archives was consulted and did find references to that in those
[09:02.040 --> 09:08.720]  conversations and now we have President Trump confirming indeed that was the case.
[09:08.720 --> 09:13.520]  So for four years Russia did not make any moves against Ukraine but they did eight years
[09:13.520 --> 09:21.120]  ago with what we saw with Obama and we saw it again happen under Biden.
[09:21.120 --> 09:26.080]  The idea of blaming Trump for peace deals with Russia, peace deals with China, peace
[09:26.080 --> 09:31.320]  deals with North Korea and then now claiming it's Trump's fault is asinine.
[09:31.320 --> 09:35.600]  It is George Soros and the globalist fault for poking the bear and moving weapons in
[09:35.600 --> 09:39.060]  there and bragging about it on national TV.
[09:39.060 --> 09:45.640]  Doesn't mean I agree with what Putin has done but they started it and now they want
[09:45.640 --> 09:52.040]  the Ukrainians to fight to the death against it as a smokescreen for what's happening
[09:52.040 --> 09:54.880]  by design and the great reset with the world economy.
[09:54.880 --> 10:02.360]  This is a big deal though and here is the video of the real president, President Trump.
[10:02.360 --> 10:28.760]  Now he's funny, it's funny how she didn't bother you either.
[10:28.760 --> 10:48.280]  So that's Trump confirming what his policies were and we know he publicly told North Korea,
[10:48.280 --> 10:55.720]  China and Russia that if you attack any major capital preemptively we will then hit you.
[10:55.720 --> 11:01.320]  President Putin and G.G.P. believed it so they didn't but under Biden who they blackmailed
[11:01.320 --> 11:06.240]  both countries have paid off him and his son on record, well they knew to make their move
[11:06.240 --> 11:08.880]  because they knew he was weak.
[11:08.880 --> 11:15.040]  So for all the leftists, cheerleading for Ukraine and Zelensky saying we need war with Russia,
[11:15.040 --> 11:21.240]  no fly zones and massive sanctions and all of this, it's you guys that allowed this to
[11:21.240 --> 11:23.000]  happen in reality.
[11:23.000 --> 11:30.200]  One in the fantasy land you live in where Trump and myself and conservatives and Christians
[11:30.200 --> 11:34.440]  and populists are Russophiles.
[11:34.440 --> 11:42.560]  We're America files, we support America, you guys are America phobes, that's the reality.
[11:42.560 --> 11:47.120]  Now there's a bunch of these clips, you know he said the State of the Union, Biden a few
[11:47.120 --> 11:54.480]  days ago, the puppet president, the reanimated corpse that's up there speaking, that Iran
[11:54.480 --> 12:00.040]  invaded Ukraine.
[12:00.040 --> 12:06.400]  Well now he's topped it, didn't even correct himself, he's now come out and said that Putin
[12:06.400 --> 12:14.160]  has invaded Russia, which I guess this is like the snake eating its tail or in some
[12:14.160 --> 12:20.200]  stranger eons maybe even death may die, as H.P. Lovecraft once said, because it's actually
[12:20.200 --> 12:24.880]  is where Russia was born, so even though he's wrong, it's not technically Russia, it's
[12:24.880 --> 12:31.320]  where Russia actually started a thousand years ago in the history books, so he's wrong but
[12:31.320 --> 12:34.200]  he's right, here it is.
[12:34.200 --> 12:42.320]  What's going on internationally, how do we get to the place where you know Putin decides
[12:42.320 --> 12:47.840]  he's going to just invade Russia, nothing like this has happened since World War II.
[12:47.840 --> 12:56.720]  Now let's listen to an even bigger idiot, and again I have hung out with Sean Penn
[12:56.720 --> 13:03.560]  and I've run into him backstage at the DNC when I was covering that, however many years
[13:03.560 --> 13:10.200]  ago that was, 12, 13 years ago in Denver, and he is literally a moron, when he plays
[13:10.200 --> 13:16.080]  the part of the cool pothead that you know the drug dealer in fast times at Ridgemont
[13:16.080 --> 13:24.840]  High, the reason he did such a good job is he's a moron, he's a moron and he runs around
[13:24.840 --> 13:30.080]  to every big event trying to be a hero, trying to find a hero, and he has endorsed Zelensky,
[13:30.080 --> 13:36.880]  another actor, of just being God, being the most incredible person he's ever seen, Zelensky
[13:36.880 --> 13:42.160]  is a Soros puppet that has been lying every step of the way and who ran his mouth about
[13:42.160 --> 13:47.120]  war with Russia and helped all this happen, and he's been posting video he shot years
[13:47.120 --> 13:54.760]  ago of himself in combat outfits as if he's at the front lines lying to people, so just
[13:54.760 --> 13:59.600]  because I don't like Putin invading Ukraine doesn't mean I've got to like Zelensky and
[13:59.600 --> 14:10.200]  all these other idiots, but I'm telling you, Sean Penn is so stupid that I'm not being
[14:10.200 --> 14:18.640]  mean, I don't think he could work at McDonald's, and here he is gushing over, I mean just look
[14:18.640 --> 14:26.600]  at him, look a vegetable, a burnout mindless vegetable that thinks he's important, and we
[14:26.600 --> 14:34.040]  have to sit here and listen to this guy, listen to him gosh over Zelensky.
[14:34.040 --> 14:40.880]  If he knew that he was born for this, but it was clear I was in the presence of something
[14:40.880 --> 14:48.600]  and again I think reflected of so many Ukrainians that was new, that was new to the modern world
[14:48.600 --> 14:55.680]  in terms of courage and dignity, and love that comes out of the man, and the way he
[14:55.680 --> 15:05.400]  is unified that country, and I think Mr. Putin certainly added to paving the way to that,
[15:05.400 --> 15:14.680]  but this is such an extraordinary moment, and I was endlessly impressed and moved by
[15:14.680 --> 15:20.480]  him and terrified for him and for Ukraine.
[15:20.480 --> 15:27.480]  The empty, lying sack of garbage paid by Soros to go over there and she'll be yes on us,
[15:27.480 --> 15:28.480]  unbelievable.
[15:28.480 --> 15:30.960]  All right, I'm going to get to the serious news when we come back, okay, because there's
[15:30.960 --> 15:34.360]  a lot of it here on Ukraine and the world and the economy, and that's really the big
[15:34.360 --> 15:38.400]  news is what it's doing to the economy, and how the economy is already sliding over the
[15:38.400 --> 15:42.640]  edge, but this is just accelerating it, and where all that's going, and then we've got
[15:42.640 --> 15:49.480]  huge COVID news where Biden secretly paid over a billion dollars to mainstream media
[15:49.480 --> 15:56.480]  to sign agreements not to talk about vaccine damage confirming the criminal racketeering.
[15:56.480 --> 16:05.160]  Two of our best selling products are back in stock, then FullWarStore.com, and they
[16:05.160 --> 16:08.920]  will sell out in the next three, four months before I get more of the product in if I sell
[16:08.920 --> 16:13.320]  it at full price, but I want those of you that have been on the fence about getting
[16:13.320 --> 16:19.800]  Winter Sun or getting X3 to try the products and see how amazing they are, and I believe
[16:19.800 --> 16:24.480]  you will then get hooked on them by myself, my family, and the crew are.
[16:24.480 --> 16:30.160]  So again, both these products are back in stock, both X3 and Winter Sun, they are 50%
[16:30.160 --> 16:35.680]  off for a limited time because they're going to sell out at this price I would estimate
[16:35.680 --> 16:37.360]  in less than a month.
[16:37.360 --> 16:41.560]  So this is your chance to get X3 and experience the good halogens or the bad halogens.
[16:41.560 --> 16:46.040]  This is your chance to have the highest quality vitamin D3 with vitamin K for your immune
[16:46.040 --> 16:47.040]  system as well.
[16:47.040 --> 16:51.840]  They're amazing, and they're at FullWarStore.com, and the reason this is a 360 win is it funds
[16:51.840 --> 16:52.840]  the operation.
[16:52.840 --> 16:57.440]  I need funds to run the operation, you need to be healthy, we need to stay on air, it's
[16:57.440 --> 17:01.960]  a match made in heaven.
[17:01.960 --> 17:03.960]  Your voice counts.
[17:03.960 --> 17:08.960]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[17:08.960 --> 17:13.840]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular, they know you're angry, and now to get around
[17:13.840 --> 17:18.480]  big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[17:59.640 --> 18:07.080]  The globalist social engineers always intended to push their COVID biomedical tyranny lockdowns
[18:07.080 --> 18:10.280]  until the populations rebelled.
[18:10.280 --> 18:15.800]  They would then use that as the pretext for permanent martial law and banning and arresting
[18:15.800 --> 18:18.800]  anybody that speaks out against their laws.
[18:18.800 --> 18:24.240]  But because of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and
[18:24.240 --> 18:29.960]  whistleblowers, now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware
[18:29.960 --> 18:36.400]  that it is a world government corporate takeover, and so it's pulling back the curtain now more
[18:36.400 --> 18:37.400]  than ever.
[18:37.400 --> 18:41.920]  The problem is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover.
[18:41.920 --> 18:48.280]  Like Canada, they've now declared a civil emergency in martial law in Ontario and other
[18:48.280 --> 18:50.600]  areas of the world are following suit like Australia.
[18:50.600 --> 18:55.440]  So pray for these folks big time, this is a very serious situation, and stay tuned into
[18:55.440 --> 18:59.320]  infowars.com because truth is absolutely paramount.
[18:59.320 --> 19:00.800]  Mike in California, thanks for calling.
[19:00.800 --> 19:05.040]  I think we're barking up the wrong tree calling this gain of function research.
[19:05.040 --> 19:10.600]  Now if you read the actual 2014 legislation, the US government gain of function deliberative
[19:10.600 --> 19:16.520]  process and research funding pause on selected gain of function research involving influenza,
[19:16.520 --> 19:21.560]  MERS and SARS viruses, there's nothing about SARS like viruses and it's a research funding
[19:21.560 --> 19:22.560]  pause.
[19:22.560 --> 19:23.560]  It's not a stop.
[19:23.560 --> 19:24.560]  It's not a prohibition.
[19:24.560 --> 19:27.920]  It's when you come to a four way intersection, there's the stop sign, you stop, you look
[19:27.920 --> 19:29.760]  both ways, and then you proceed.
[19:29.760 --> 19:34.280]  And so it's also, it doesn't pause all gain of function, just selected gain of function.
[19:34.280 --> 19:38.800]  But they'll argue that this is actually characterization and qualification research.
[19:38.800 --> 19:41.680]  So you know, Rand and others, you know, maybe Fauci was right.
[19:41.680 --> 19:44.760]  They don't quite know what they're talking about calling it gain of function, you know,
[19:44.760 --> 19:47.960]  that's why he didn't perjure himself, that's why he hasn't been arrested because they're
[19:47.960 --> 19:52.000]  literally creating new synthetic life forms that mimic what the viruses do.
[19:52.000 --> 19:55.080]  But in the main definition, it's still a gain of function.
[19:55.080 --> 19:57.760]  They're making something deadly that spreads more easily to hurt people.
[19:57.760 --> 19:58.760]  Thank you, Mike.
[19:58.760 --> 20:01.760]  We love you.
[20:01.760 --> 20:25.760]  We'll see you in the next video.
[20:25.760 --> 20:43.760]  Putin is trying to take Ukraine with limited casualties and limited loss of life and infrastructure.
[20:43.760 --> 20:46.520]  He said that on record.
[20:46.520 --> 20:51.960]  And as soon as the secretary of state announced that NATO was going to be sending fighter
[20:51.960 --> 20:58.960]  jets to use the airfields outside Kiev to attack Russian forces, the Russians destroyed
[20:58.960 --> 21:05.680]  all the major airfields around Kiev and three other cities in one hour.
[21:05.680 --> 21:11.640]  So Russia did send in its conscripts, its draftees, kind of like McNamara did in Vietnam, to draw
[21:11.640 --> 21:15.440]  out the enemy, to use up the ammunition, it's a pretty cold blooded move.
[21:15.440 --> 21:19.800]  The real Russian army has been sitting back waiting.
[21:19.800 --> 21:25.560]  And now you're starting to see it move and you're starting to see a lot of precision
[21:25.560 --> 21:29.200]  devastation.
[21:29.200 --> 21:39.120]  Also it's confirmed in its own record that the Ukrainian forces and the three main Nazi
[21:39.120 --> 21:46.920]  brigades that are actually, they wear Nazi outfits, they wear swastikas, they howl Hitler,
[21:46.920 --> 21:50.840]  those three groups are not letting Ukrainians evacuate to the west.
[21:50.840 --> 21:55.680]  It's all on video, it's all on informers.com, we have a live update page with hundreds
[21:55.680 --> 22:03.040]  of links and they are hiding in schools that no children are in and hospitals thinking
[22:03.040 --> 22:12.080]  Russians won't shoot at those, but then redditors and Twitter users have flooded there, leftist,
[22:12.080 --> 22:14.360]  literally with pink and blue hair and all the rest of it.
[22:14.360 --> 22:17.720]  The photos and videos are insane.
[22:17.720 --> 22:26.600]  There's articles and videos about it on Band-Aw video and they are geolocating, the CNN said
[22:26.600 --> 22:31.160]  geolocate where you are when you sit in your footage so we can give you credit and buy
[22:31.160 --> 22:32.920]  the footage from you know it's real.
[22:32.920 --> 22:42.400]  So they're geolocating videos and photos where they're with the rebel forces and the Russians
[22:42.400 --> 22:52.720]  then artillery attack or bomb with jets or missile strike, the grid on the GPS, I mean
[22:52.720 --> 22:56.840]  that's a whole other show folks, I forgot to tell the crew to get the videos and articles
[22:56.840 --> 23:01.760]  on that, but there's a big section on informers.com, a live show, update page where we have some
[23:01.760 --> 23:05.200]  of that, again there's some videos on the front page of Band-Aw video where other reporters
[23:05.200 --> 23:10.240]  have gone and shown this, it is just next level to have CNN, I'm sure you've all seen
[23:10.240 --> 23:13.840]  it, the CNN doesn't normally have viewers but it does during a war so I've been watching
[23:13.840 --> 23:20.440]  it some and you know other channels and they're on there saying be sure and geotag your videos
[23:20.440 --> 23:27.000]  and photos so we know it's real and then the left thousands of citizen journalists I guess
[23:27.000 --> 23:34.320]  to be heroes and it's a big story are pouring in and even showing off their guns they've
[23:34.320 --> 23:43.000]  got and then they're dying because they're tweeting and Facebooking and redditing geolocated
[23:43.000 --> 23:49.640]  videos and photos that anybody can go get and find out the location of, here I am with
[23:49.640 --> 23:57.760]  the Ukrainian fighters in the school and then 10 minutes later artillery shells rain down
[23:57.760 --> 24:05.720]  on them and kill everybody and so you'll see headlines like, oh Russians attacked more
[24:05.720 --> 24:12.600]  schools, 50 schools destroyed today, you don't see the word children though because there
[24:12.600 --> 24:19.640]  are no children in those schools, you've got to really ask yourself how we're ruled by
[24:19.640 --> 24:25.400]  people like CNN crew or maybe they just want to see Ukrainians killed, be sure and give
[24:25.400 --> 24:36.680]  us your geolocation that then anybody can get, you're not to tell people when they come
[24:36.680 --> 24:41.160]  over to my house, hey please don't, if you're going to take photos of my house please don't
[24:41.160 --> 24:49.000]  geolocate it, please and they look at you like you've got three heads and I'm not even
[24:49.000 --> 24:53.120]  a tech guy but I remember 20 plus years ago I had reporters in my house and they go why
[24:53.120 --> 25:00.120]  do you have a camera, I mean a tape with a piece of paper over your webcam and I said
[25:00.120 --> 25:03.440]  because the government routinely just dials in on those and so the foreign governments
[25:03.440 --> 25:07.600]  and hackers, of course years later the FBI director said you should do it, all the rest
[25:07.600 --> 25:13.280]  of it but again that's the naivete of the public and I'm digressing, I'm sorry there's
[25:13.280 --> 25:17.680]  so much news here, we'll hit all the Russia stuff and more next hour but let me hit some
[25:17.680 --> 25:23.480]  of this right now, US and LIs quietly prepare for Ukrainian government in exile and a long
[25:23.480 --> 25:28.840]  insurgency and I can tell you the Green Berets and the Navy Seals are in there training the
[25:28.840 --> 25:32.960]  insurgency right now and the US is basically at war with Russia and this is just a bad
[25:32.960 --> 25:38.600]  thing anyway you slice it, Putin says Western sanctions are a candid declaration of war,
[25:38.600 --> 25:42.700]  that's what sanctions are, what do you think cutting off our pipelines and doing one sided
[25:42.700 --> 25:47.600]  trade deals with China is, it's war against the American people, it's called siege, Putin
[25:47.600 --> 25:51.760]  warns against creating no fly zone over Ukraine.
[25:51.760 --> 25:57.720]  So here's the video, Secretary of State Blinken goes out and gives a speech, watch the whole
[25:57.720 --> 26:02.560]  press conference, it's on infowars.com and says oh yeah we're sending him planes, we're
[26:02.560 --> 26:07.440]  sending them planes now from Poland so the Russians then bomb all the airfields, it's
[26:07.440 --> 26:14.120]  going to end with Ukraine prevailing, Secretary of State Blinken says NATO countries have
[26:14.120 --> 26:23.320]  the green light to send fighter jets to Ukraine, Zelensky pleads with the US Senate for fighter
[26:23.320 --> 26:30.080]  jets and Russian oil embargo in call with US senators, guess what Schumer also called
[26:30.080 --> 26:37.160]  for, he called for the lockdowns and the COVID emergency declared two years ago by Trump
[26:37.160 --> 26:48.920]  to be kept in force but the Senate outvoted our Hitler clone, that's another form of siege
[26:48.920 --> 26:56.080]  against us ladies and gentlemen, is trying to keep those COVID restrictions in place.
[26:56.080 --> 27:02.400]  NATO nations can send jets to Ukraine banned on imports of Russian oil being discussed,
[27:02.400 --> 27:08.520]  Yahoo, Furious Zelensky lashes out at weak NATO for not imposing no fly zones, cartoon
[27:08.520 --> 27:16.240]  villain or rational actor, the problem behind the goodies and the baddies, foreign policy,
[27:16.240 --> 27:20.000]  White House says it's working with Poland to get jets to Ukraine, Warsaw says it's not
[27:20.000 --> 27:29.360]  true, over 3,000 Americans have applied to join the Ukrainian military but in a poll
[27:29.360 --> 27:35.320]  it's wealthier Americans who support military involvement in European war because they don't
[27:35.320 --> 27:42.520]  have to go fight and die, look at this, the Ukrainian peace negotiator who was the interpreter
[27:42.520 --> 27:46.760]  and not they need much interpreting but there were some Americans there, has been shot dead
[27:46.760 --> 27:51.600]  and been claims he was a Russian spy after the latest meeting, so that's how Ukrainians
[27:51.600 --> 27:58.160]  are behaving, that's not too smart to kill some of the negotiators, we got so much more
[27:58.160 --> 28:05.440]  coming up, next segment we'll learn about the convoy, the U.S. government still trying
[28:05.440 --> 28:09.760]  to make truck drivers that cross the border either way to take injections of this deadly
[28:09.760 --> 28:14.160]  gene therapy and so we need to remember that they're going to try to bring back all the
[28:14.160 --> 28:17.840]  COVID restrictions if we don't continue to expose the fraud it was, if we just brush
[28:17.840 --> 28:24.280]  ourselves off from the last year of abuse, last two years of abuse and go back to the
[28:24.280 --> 28:30.520]  next big story that's war then Fauci and Gates and the New World Order and Pfizer and Moderna
[28:30.520 --> 28:35.080]  none of them get in trouble for what they've done so that's very important in Savannah
[28:35.080 --> 28:44.440]  Hernandez doing news reportage with TruthSocial whose NDC will join us and then we're going
[28:44.440 --> 28:52.160]  to get into the huge COVID news it's the biggest yet and Sean Stone joining us on the burning
[28:52.160 --> 29:00.280]  of Ukraine.
[29:00.280 --> 29:06.640]  It's hard to believe that we're already into March 2022 and in the month of February we
[29:06.640 --> 29:12.880]  had a very popular sale that was going of our flagship product X3 that has all three
[29:12.880 --> 29:19.520]  types of the amazing iodine your body needs for every electrochemical cellular activity
[29:19.520 --> 29:25.040]  in your body, your immune system, your stamina, your libido so much and the majority of the
[29:25.040 --> 29:29.800]  population in the world is iodine deficient this is the very best iodine out there.
[29:29.800 --> 29:34.800]  So we had on sale 50% off but we sold more than half of what we have or isn't going to
[29:34.800 --> 29:39.080]  come in for a long time so I took it back to full process and I was just thinking you
[29:39.080 --> 29:43.640]  know what we need the funds in now to stay on air plus this is the right product everybody
[29:43.640 --> 29:48.400]  needs so to incentivize folks out there that have been on the fence to get X3 and experience
[29:48.400 --> 29:53.360]  it yourself and support the broadcast I'm going to keep it at 50% off until it sells
[29:53.360 --> 30:03.840]  out get X3 right now exclusively at infowarstore.com for 50% off.
[30:03.840 --> 30:07.640]  Granny do write, Granny do write thanks for holding her on the air go ahead.

[30:13.160 --> 30:17.600]  citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me I was loaded up
[30:17.600 --> 30:23.280]  with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called but since taking your X2 for the last
[30:23.280 --> 30:30.640]  couple of years my skin is just really gorgeous actually people think I'm 55 years old and
[30:30.640 --> 30:34.720]  I was already taking your other supplements but I thought you know well maybe that's what
[30:34.720 --> 30:39.240]  I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation but when I started taking
[30:39.240 --> 30:44.720]  it I mean it doesn't happen immediately but you know over a period of time I started noticing
[30:44.720 --> 30:50.440]  okay you know this is a ticket this is working this is wonderful you know I don't I don't
[30:50.440 --> 30:55.960]  have to put on derma blend anymore you know so anyway it worked wonderfully and it really
[30:55.960 --> 31:01.080]  has totally cleared up my skin.
[31:01.080 --> 31:05.120]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days with everything that's going on
[31:05.120 --> 31:10.440]  both at home and the world at large if you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep

[33:33.840 --> 34:01.840]  we got a long way to go at a short time to get there
[34:01.840 --> 34:10.520]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen I'm your host alex jones and former info wars reporter
[34:10.520 --> 34:16.280]  savannah Hernandez has worked with the blaze and is doing work the truth social is up there
[34:16.280 --> 34:22.720]  hovering the people's convoy that started arriving from all over the country in DC today
[34:22.720 --> 34:31.440]  and the big online and apple and iphone droid apps for traffic are showing that the entire
[34:31.440 --> 34:37.400]  beltway around DC is at a standstill tonight as the trucks get there and I'm told that
[34:37.400 --> 34:42.680]  trucks have already started getting into the main area of DC where all the different memorials
[34:42.680 --> 34:47.360]  and government buildings are and reportedly honking their horns pointing out that they
[34:47.360 --> 34:54.000]  want the COVID-19 police state to end we have had the US senate vote to end the national
[34:54.000 --> 34:59.160]  emergency but the house still has to do it but in blue zones in many areas they're vowing
[34:59.160 --> 35:04.440]  to keep the mask on forever and seeing it and others are saying keep the mask on forever
[35:04.440 --> 35:09.280]  so we're starting to win the war against the COVID power grab but we've not won the war
[35:09.280 --> 35:16.560]  yet we've just won some major battles so savannah was just able to get to her hotel and to give
[35:16.560 --> 35:19.880]  us a report savannah great to have you with us tonight tell us what you've been witnessing
[35:19.880 --> 35:29.840]  as you followed the convoy so we today were watching the convoy they actually haven't
[35:29.840 --> 35:34.800]  made their way into DC but they went ahead and did two loops around the beltway which
[35:34.800 --> 35:40.480]  is made up of the I-495 and the I-95 and they said that they did this because they're trying
[35:40.480 --> 35:46.280]  to be strategic of course they don't want a january 6 2.0 type of thing happening they're
[35:46.280 --> 35:52.400]  very wary of the government trying to you know stage a false flag make them look bad
[35:52.400 --> 35:56.800]  so they're being very strategic and they did two loops around the beltway today there were
[35:56.800 --> 36:03.480]  thousands of vehicles in tow we're talking semi trucks of G SUVs regularly like a Toyota
[36:03.480 --> 36:08.000]  Corolla this is called the people's convoy because it isn't just semi trucks it's people
[36:08.000 --> 36:14.080]  from all over the nation it started off in autobahn say california on wednesday february
[36:14.080 --> 36:20.760]  23rd and we are now on day 12 of this convoy they've made their way to again the DC beltway
[36:20.760 --> 36:24.240]  they're currently in havers down maryland where they stopped for the night and they
[36:24.240 --> 36:29.920]  said they're going to continue to drive this beltway until that national emergency is declared
[36:29.920 --> 36:35.640]  over they want biden to stop basically you know impeding on everybody's rights and freedoms
[36:35.640 --> 36:39.480]  and they're not standing up for the majority right now who keeps saying oh why are these
[36:39.480 --> 36:43.720]  people even protesting it's pointless they're standing up for the minority the police officers
[36:43.720 --> 36:48.360]  the nurses the military personnel that are still being subjected to force vaccination
[36:48.360 --> 36:54.520]  and are still being fired because of this national emergency order well just overnight
[36:54.520 --> 37:02.000]  savannah we're told forget about covid it's all over now let's move on to ukraine let's
[37:02.000 --> 37:07.720]  move on to russia like somebody flipped a switch and they want to tell us that rush is the reason
[37:07.720 --> 37:11.800]  we're about to have a worldwide economic meltdown or that energy prices are up but but we know
[37:11.800 --> 37:16.520]  this was already all unfolding long before and again we're showing some of the shots
[37:16.520 --> 37:22.280]  local news is reporting that the beltway is basically at a crawl very unusual for this
[37:22.280 --> 37:26.480]  time of night so you say you were there savannah and that there are thousands of vehicles
[37:26.480 --> 37:34.480]  and alice you bring up russia ukraine i had to pay four dollars and seventy cents for
[37:34.480 --> 37:40.160]  a gallon of gas yesterday here in the dc area the gas prices are absolutely ridiculous
[37:40.160 --> 37:44.640]  over here and yes you're completely right our entire media has shifted the narrative
[37:44.640 --> 37:49.000]  they want to focus in on russia ukraine they're painting russia as this bad guy as booting
[37:49.000 --> 37:53.760]  as the worst worst thing that's ever happened when in reality the biggest threat to america
[37:53.760 --> 37:58.720]  right now is biden this administration and this regime that is destroying america from
[37:58.720 --> 38:03.240]  the inside biden and many of the other people in this administration are already trying to
[38:03.240 --> 38:08.920]  say that the troppers in canada were insurrectionists that the canadian officials should have used
[38:08.920 --> 38:12.880]  federal powers to shut them down so of course the american truckers here don't try to get
[38:12.880 --> 38:17.200]  their voices heard but be a lot more strategic about it because many of them are very fearful
[38:17.200 --> 38:20.840]  of our government because they have seen the overreach they have seen the power of the
[38:20.840 --> 38:26.320]  media in painting them as these terrorists these domestic insurrectionists and we've
[38:26.320 --> 38:31.200]  seen the government come full force against these people so the truckers so far have been
[38:31.200 --> 38:35.280]  very friendly very energetic but of course very cautious of the media they're cautious
[38:35.280 --> 38:40.880]  of who they talk to because they do not want the narrative being rewritten about what is
[38:40.880 --> 38:47.400]  what this is about again they want all this to just go away and some people are saying
[38:47.400 --> 38:51.480]  hey covid's over why are you complaining but as you said the u.s. government's trying
[38:51.480 --> 38:55.360]  to make canadian and u.s. truckers that go back and forth across the border take these
[38:55.360 --> 38:59.960]  deadly shots use these apps to track everywhere they go but if you're an illegal alien coming
[38:59.960 --> 39:07.440]  across the southern border you don't have to energy from these truckers has been amazing
[39:07.440 --> 39:11.920]  their freedom loving americans i actually did a video yesterday where i had truckers
[39:11.920 --> 39:16.360]  give me their first name where they were from and an item that they deliver to the american
[39:16.360 --> 39:22.280]  people that we may take for granted so i heard things like balloons corn onions cucumbers
[39:22.280 --> 39:27.080]  a children's playground so many items are delivered to us from these truckers the same
[39:27.080 --> 39:31.640]  truckers that this administration has come down on has taken rights away from and even
[39:31.640 --> 39:35.560]  ask them what are you fighting for here today and so many of them said that they were fighting
[39:35.560 --> 39:39.320]  for their freedoms they were fighting for their children their future grandkids they
[39:39.320 --> 39:43.840]  were fighting for your kids because they realize that our country is not the same place that
[39:43.840 --> 39:48.320]  they grew up in and now is the time to fight for their freedoms and stand up so again the
[39:48.320 --> 39:53.440]  truckers said they're not going anywhere until this national emergency is completely lifted
[39:53.440 --> 39:58.200]  across all states across the entire country they have had enough of this nonsense and
[39:58.200 --> 40:04.680]  they will continue this protest until their voices are heard let's talk about truth social
[40:04.680 --> 40:10.640]  i have really been excited to see it starting to work the bugs out and millions of people
[40:10.640 --> 40:16.040]  joining it i know you're covering things for truth social right now what's your view on
[40:16.040 --> 40:22.920]  where you think truth social is going great platform we know that censorship has been
[40:22.920 --> 40:27.640]  one of the biggest issues that anybody in the media has faced really if you're willing
[40:27.640 --> 40:31.240]  to tell the truth in this space if you're willing to expose corruption you're going
[40:31.240 --> 40:36.000]  to be censored at one point or another my favorite part about truth social so far is
[40:36.000 --> 40:39.760]  the fact that i've actually been able to see what's actually going on in russia we're
[40:39.760 --> 40:47.280]  seeing that commentary we're seeing the political analysis about nato about why russia has made
[40:47.280 --> 40:52.240]  these moves so it's a very interesting site and again they describe it to me as basically
[40:52.240 --> 40:57.240]  like a big 10 site where they want people from all aspects of politics and all over
[40:57.240 --> 41:01.520]  the world to be able to have a conversation censorship free so that way they can talk
[41:01.520 --> 41:06.240]  about their ideas people can understand different viewpoints so it's been good so far of course
[41:06.240 --> 41:10.000]  it's in the beginning stages so still working out a lot of things but i think it's going
[41:10.000 --> 41:13.920]  to be great to have another platform where people can spread the truth and where we can
[41:13.920 --> 41:21.200]  hear from former president donald trump another man who has been very heavily censored bolsa
[41:21.200 --> 41:26.480]  vanna i can't wait to see you out there on the road tomorrow and i'd love to have you
[41:26.480 --> 41:30.280]  here with us during the week they show to break this down the live fee but i can't
[41:30.280 --> 41:35.720]  think of anything more important than peaceful americans going out and showing their discomfort
[41:35.720 --> 41:40.080]  with the ruling class trying to put us under a biomedical permanent martial law grid in
[41:40.080 --> 41:45.400]  closing what do you make of the leaders of the peaceful canadian trucker protest held
[41:45.400 --> 41:51.000]  in shackles held without bond facing 10 years in prison i've been treated like their al-qaeda
[41:51.000 --> 41:59.640]  governor federal government encouraged the canadian government to use federal powers
[41:59.640 --> 42:03.760]  to shut down these truckers shows us very well what they think of the american people
[42:03.760 --> 42:08.560]  look at the fact that the dhs just updated their terrorism bulletin to add misinformation
[42:08.560 --> 42:12.480]  and disinformation online essentially if you don't trust the government they're trying
[42:12.480 --> 42:16.360]  to think people as domestic terrorists because they question the government because we see
[42:16.360 --> 42:20.480]  that it's all corrupt so we should be very wary of this administration and how they
[42:20.480 --> 42:24.920]  view american freedoms because we've seen the immense attack that every single american
[42:24.920 --> 42:29.520]  has been under over the past two years and it's absolutely disgusting so please use
[42:29.520 --> 42:33.440]  your voice while you still have it no matter who you are the american truckers making a
[42:33.440 --> 42:38.640]  very big impact and making a very strong statement here every single american needs to continue
[42:38.640 --> 42:42.920]  to do this not be distracted by what's going on abroad but focused in here at home and
[42:42.920 --> 42:47.120]  then divided administration are an important message that we need to bring america back
[42:47.120 --> 42:51.280]  and we need to stop allowing it to be destroyed from the inside by these corrupt officials
[42:51.280 --> 42:55.720]  so then i totally agree shifting gears out of the truckers i want your view on the situation
[42:55.720 --> 43:02.160]  you crane straight ahead we'll be right back two of our best selling products are back
[43:02.160 --> 43:07.120]  in stock then fullwarstore.com and they will sell out in the next three four months before
[43:07.120 --> 43:11.960]  i get more of the product then if i sell it at full price but i want those of you that
[43:11.960 --> 43:17.120]  have been on the fence about getting one or son or getting x3 to try the products and
[43:17.120 --> 43:22.440]  see how amazing they are and i believe you will then get hooked on them like myself my
[43:22.440 --> 43:27.920]  family and the crew are so again both these products are back in stock both x3 and one
[43:27.920 --> 43:33.680]  or son they are 50% off for a limited time because they're going to sell out at this
[43:33.680 --> 43:39.880]  price i would estimate in less than a month so this is your chance to get x3 and experience
[43:39.880 --> 43:43.400]  the good halogens versus the bad halogens this is your chance to have the highest quality
[43:43.400 --> 43:47.880]  vitamin d3 with vitamin k for your immune system as well they're amazing and they're
[43:47.880 --> 43:54.080]  an infowarstore.com the reason this is a 360 win is it funds the operation i need funds
[43:54.080 --> 43:58.080]  to run the operation you need to be healthy we need to stay on air it's a match made in
[43:58.080 --> 44:05.640]  heaven i stay on air selling high quality products that you need that you want and that
[44:05.640 --> 44:10.400]  you're going to be happy with that's why you come back and buy products from me again it's
[44:10.400 --> 44:15.440]  a symbiotic relationship i promote liberty i promote freedom i fight the globalist and
[44:15.440 --> 44:19.880]  i'm able to do that because you buy products and infowarstore.com and listen all the products
[44:19.880 --> 44:25.240]  are great but when it comes to high quality storeable food in an inflationary system with
[44:25.240 --> 44:32.120]  major supply chain breakdowns this is an absolute 360 win a no brainer and they've got high quality
[44:32.120 --> 44:37.080]  storeable food ready to ship to you right now the great folks at my patreon supply exclusively
[44:37.080 --> 44:43.040]  prepare with alex.com discounted so again beat inflation be prepared fund the infowar
[44:43.040 --> 44:48.880]  the only way you lose is not taking action at infowarstore.com or prepare with alex.com
[44:48.880 --> 44:53.640]  right now this is high quality storeable food this is how you beat inflation get yours today
[44:53.640 --> 44:57.920]  it's ready to ship but i wouldn't wait because prices are about to go up because inflation
[44:57.920 --> 45:05.520]  is exploding it has been noted by many a historian the first casualty of war is the truth then
[45:05.520 --> 45:12.800]  the next big casualty isn't even the people that die no that invariably follows but first
[45:12.800 --> 45:20.320]  there is the crackdown on populations basic liberty and speech and massive censorship
[45:20.320 --> 45:26.280]  and now across the world from the united states to europe legislations being introduced that
[45:26.280 --> 45:36.040]  if you amplify any quote pro russian information you can be censored you can be arrested you
[45:36.040 --> 45:41.080]  can be imprisoned and of course now canada is under this legislation that if you have
[45:41.080 --> 45:47.800]  a thought crime and they think you may have the intent to engage in hate speech online
[45:47.800 --> 45:52.440]  that you will be censored and arrested ladies and gentlemen the authoritarianism is being
[45:52.440 --> 45:57.240]  carried out by the globalists around the world against humanity that makes info wars dot com
[45:57.240 --> 46:08.680]  more important than ever
[46:08.680 --> 46:13.680]  people are asleep and programmed controlled i agree how do you make the sleeper awaken
[46:13.680 --> 46:23.720]  William hi Alex thanks for taking my call can i plug Alex real quick hey i'm in my 60s
[46:23.720 --> 46:25.480]  and i did the work of 25 30 year olds and i worked them into the ground and you wanted

[46:42.240 --> 46:48.560]  fact that yeah for a guy in his 60s you know pushing 70 i'm and i know i'm not just blowing
[46:48.560 --> 47:00.720]  smoke here the b12 saves my life
[47:00.720 --> 47:16.960]  reading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[47:16.960 --> 47:45.720]  it's all about freedom freedom freedom
[47:45.720 --> 47:57.880]  welcome back here to this live sunday transmission march 6 2022 freedom freedom freedom is under
[47:57.880 --> 48:04.440]  attack right now in russia and the u.s. and worldwide and governments everywhere using
[48:04.440 --> 48:11.760]  it to shut down free speech look at this we're talking to investigative reporter savannah
[48:11.760 --> 48:17.640]  hernandez also a great videographer and she is on the ground in dc or tens of thousands
[48:17.640 --> 48:22.880]  vehicles have shown up in the american freedom convoy against the police state and there
[48:22.880 --> 48:30.680]  she is on the great truth social russia blocks facebook and twitter and then facebook put
[48:30.680 --> 48:36.640]  out a statement saying soon millions of ordinary russians will find themselves cut off from
[48:36.640 --> 48:42.400]  reliable information deprived of their everyday ways of connecting with family and friends
[48:42.400 --> 48:47.080]  and silence we're speaking out we'll continue everything we can to restore our services
[48:47.080 --> 48:52.320]  so they can remain available to people safely and securely express themselves and organize
[48:52.320 --> 48:57.600]  for action what happened to 90 percent of conservatives it's estimated have been taken
[48:57.600 --> 49:03.840]  off facebook or twitter what about the president being taken off what about all of that so cnn
[49:03.840 --> 49:09.600]  abc cbs bbc all cease russian broadcasting because they passed a law saying it's illegal
[49:09.600 --> 49:13.480]  to put out fake news i don't agree with what putin's doing america's supposed to be the
[49:13.480 --> 49:19.480]  example of free speech but we have this paradox where the corporate media that censors and
[49:19.480 --> 49:24.520]  spies and controls and says they want people arrested for their speech or shoot out of
[49:24.520 --> 49:30.040]  existence for questioning mass shootings or any other event but then they cry bloody murder
[49:30.040 --> 49:36.560]  when somebody censors them and says oh it's a human right to have access to facebook only
[49:36.560 --> 49:41.720]  for russians not for americans after we build it we promote it we send people there and
[49:41.720 --> 49:47.160]  then they take it away so then her name is your take on this and russia and ukraine and
[49:47.160 --> 49:52.600]  where you think it's all going well i would have to thank you personally alex because
[49:52.600 --> 49:56.560]  you were one of the first people that was laying out exactly what was going on in russia and
[49:56.560 --> 50:01.800]  ukraine and one of the only people so when all of this was first developing i like the
[50:01.800 --> 50:06.560]  average american don't have a long historical understanding of the tensions between these
[50:06.560 --> 50:12.120]  two areas and so i try to google it and of course there were no articles about nato about
[50:12.120 --> 50:16.680]  the west influence with ukraine about why russia has been so aggressive or why they
[50:16.680 --> 50:21.880]  decided to invade ukraine and so you are one of the only people that was talking about
[50:21.880 --> 50:25.240]  this issue and i was even telling all of my friends if you really want to know what's
[50:25.240 --> 50:29.160]  going on over there go to van dot video and go listen to alex johns because he's one
[50:29.160 --> 50:34.880]  of the only people actually laying out in a historical context what's going on so it's
[50:34.880 --> 50:40.000]  been very difficult for the average american to actually understand what's going on and
[50:40.000 --> 50:44.400]  now the censorship is cracking down we aren't allowed to hear from russians at all russian
[50:44.400 --> 50:49.280]  people are being you know attacked themselves they can't use their own bank accounts for
[50:49.280 --> 50:54.120]  being censored we can't see any information coming out of that country ukraine is being
[50:54.120 --> 50:59.640]  propped up here in the u.s and we see all of the same war mongers all of the same politicians
[50:59.640 --> 51:05.240]  and all of the same media who have lied to us for the past two years propping up ukraine
[51:05.240 --> 51:09.600]  and it's baffling to me that conservatives who you know said that all these people are
[51:09.600 --> 51:16.360]  sworn enemies for lying to us these same conservatives are now on the side of those pushing for war
[51:16.360 --> 51:20.680]  in ukraine it's absolutely disgusting to me i want the truth i listen to your show because
[51:20.680 --> 51:26.160]  i want the truth so i have to say thank you to you for um you know again highlighting
[51:26.160 --> 51:29.720]  and exposing what's actually going on because you're not going to get that from the mainstream
[51:29.720 --> 51:34.920]  media or even from a google search well that's why it's important to show all the different
[51:34.920 --> 51:39.920]  angles we show the different propaganda from russia from the united states from the uk
[51:39.920 --> 51:45.880]  from ukraine we show it all and both sides are obviously being deceptive my big takeaway
[51:45.880 --> 51:52.080]  here is that soros overthrew the elected government eight years ago he bragged about it he says
[51:52.080 --> 51:57.000]  he's conquering russia he brags about it on tv and then they go and poke the bear what
[51:57.000 --> 52:02.200]  do they expect to happen and and then that's my first question for you and then secondarily
[52:02.200 --> 52:07.120]  i know a lot of prominent prominent conservatives i know a lot of people the media you know off
[52:07.120 --> 52:11.600]  record they tell me what they really think they're also sick of soros and hollywood on
[52:11.600 --> 52:16.320]  the left that by them endorsing zolensky they're now siding with putin i think we should be
[52:16.320 --> 52:21.320]  neutral we should call for peace and not be part of this but i'm telling you the establishment
[52:21.320 --> 52:26.600]  is so hated in america that the majority of people i know christians conservatives you
[52:26.600 --> 52:33.720]  name it they are all actually rooting for russia and that is a reflection of how discredited
[52:33.720 --> 52:39.240]  our political elites are what's your views on that samana exactly and again just being
[52:39.240 --> 52:43.720]  on the ground being at the people's convoy they are so careful with who they talk to
[52:43.720 --> 52:48.400]  and why is that because the public has lost so much trust in the media because they know
[52:48.400 --> 52:52.120]  that the media is going to take a situation and they're going to spin it for whatever
[52:52.120 --> 52:56.040]  is popular whatever is going to get the most clicks whatever is going to get the most attention
[52:56.040 --> 53:00.280]  whatever is going to make the most money and that's what's happening right now with russia
[53:00.280 --> 53:05.680]  and ukraine they're not getting the truth why because the military industrial complex
[53:05.680 --> 53:11.040]  wants to make money off of this war between russia and ukraine because war is a very lucrative
[53:11.040 --> 53:15.400]  thing that's why we're seeing all of these politicians who are going to be making copious
[53:15.400 --> 53:20.160]  amounts of money off of this pushing this in our faces i was reading at the beginning
[53:20.160 --> 53:24.920]  of all of the conflict a political article that was essentially trying to push us into
[53:24.920 --> 53:28.320]  war with russia and painting the narrative that we immediately needed to attack them
[53:28.320 --> 53:34.600]  and be on the side of ukraine the article was sponsored by lockheed martin at this point
[53:34.600 --> 53:38.480]  if people don't see what's going on if people don't understand that we are being baited
[53:38.480 --> 53:44.200]  into a war that is only going to further enrich the same corrupt politicians that continue
[53:44.200 --> 53:49.400]  to lie to us i don't know how to help you know that that americans so we do have access
[53:49.400 --> 53:54.520]  to information like our broadcast like the end of video you do really have to research
[53:54.520 --> 53:59.880]  and be very diligent about finding the truth about what's going on but that is our duty
[53:59.880 --> 54:05.800]  to do so so that we were not sending you know innocent people to go die in a senseless war
[54:05.800 --> 54:09.520]  absolutely and all the corporate media here in the u.s saying no one should be able to
[54:09.520 --> 54:13.720]  question the official narrative when the official narrative is being proven to be a lie every
[54:13.720 --> 54:19.200]  day there was no gust of kiev there was no actual shelling of the reactors they were
[54:19.200 --> 54:23.880]  not damaged they shot up a command building that had troops in it shooting at them and
[54:23.880 --> 54:28.760]  i'm not defending the russians but nobody died at snake island so much of this has
[54:28.760 --> 54:35.720]  been downright complete fabricated lies and i mean alex think about the fact too that
[54:35.720 --> 54:40.440]  if you even do want to understand why russia is being so aggressive you're immediately
[54:40.440 --> 54:46.160]  labeled a pro russian Putin apologist are you kidding me so again the censorship that
[54:46.160 --> 54:51.560]  we initially experienced online was just setting us up for censorship in the real world now
[54:51.560 --> 54:56.360]  people are even afraid to question anything that isn't pro ukraine or to maybe look into
[54:56.360 --> 55:00.480]  some of the history with why Putin may be acting the way he is because they're immediately
[55:00.480 --> 55:04.280]  labeled pro-prudence so they're scared to speak out against it and question things that we
[55:04.280 --> 55:08.600]  should be able to question at a basic level that's right well the russians are in a real
[55:08.600 --> 55:14.600]  war against western high tech anti tank and anti aircraft missiles this is not like when
[55:14.600 --> 55:18.600]  the united states goes in to these terrible countries and our troops on the ground certainly
[55:18.600 --> 55:25.880]  fight and certainly face small arms and explosive devices but this is a real war and the russians
[55:25.880 --> 55:30.200]  are dying by the tens of thousands and you better believe the Ukrainians are dying by
[55:30.200 --> 55:36.720]  the tens of thousands this is horrible and we pray for peace and we pray for NATO to
[55:36.720 --> 55:42.600]  announce that it will not absorb Ukraine and so that Putin can pull out Putin's even talking
[55:42.600 --> 55:48.040]  about expanding more behind the scenes from our intel and i just think that's a terrible
[55:48.040 --> 55:53.000]  idea i understand my Putin was pushed into this from his perspective but long term it's
[55:53.000 --> 55:56.480]  going to be bad for the people of the world i hope it stops soon savannah hernandez you'll
[55:56.480 --> 56:01.280]  be joining us at noon tomorrow live from the convoy great job we're watching all your great

[56:30.920 --> 56:36.640]  this operation without your funds now i've been selling iodine for 10 years not the crappy
[56:36.640 --> 56:41.040]  toxic stuff from the store that works great topically for cuts and things or what hospitals
[56:41.040 --> 56:50.040]  use real atomic crystal iodine and ladies and gentlemen we have it in x3 at info or
[56:50.040 --> 56:53.400]  store dot com and even though it's going to sell out the next month we won't get more
[56:53.400 --> 56:58.400]  of it probably until the fall or maybe even later it's going to take a while to get this
[56:58.400 --> 57:05.840]  they're talking about six months maybe ladies and gentlemen x3 is 50% off and look at these
[57:05.840 --> 57:13.140]  articles about it google searches for iodine pills skyrocket russian invasion of ukraine
[57:13.140 --> 57:18.480]  president putin ordering nuclear deterrent forces replaced on special alert has gotten
[57:18.480 --> 57:22.960]  a lot of people concerned out there to try to uptake their iodine levels in case there
[57:22.960 --> 57:27.880]  is a radiological event it can offer some protection but that's not why i sell this
[57:27.880 --> 57:32.000]  i sell it because most people have iodine deficiency it's used in every electrochemical
[57:32.000 --> 57:37.720]  action of the body it's critical for immune system it's amazing it's next level for people
[57:37.720 --> 57:41.200]  that have been trying all the supplements it had a great effect but once something taken

[57:51.720 --> 57:57.520]  of lasting durability anything that's really satisfying empowering and fulfilling is going
[57:57.520 --> 58:04.400]  to be hard to attain and when it comes to information boys that's true today we see
[58:04.400 --> 58:11.080]  the entire global corrupt into a human depopulation great recent combine trying to collapse our
[58:11.080 --> 58:18.360]  society to build on its ashes their their transhumanist nightmare vision suppressing the voices
[58:18.360 --> 58:23.720]  of good people all around the world and of doctors and scientists and engineers that
[58:23.720 --> 58:30.120]  are exposing all their lives their covid hysteria their world's gonna end in 2030 carbon tax
[58:30.120 --> 58:35.720]  global warming bull all of it and none of it can succeed none of it can actually be
[58:35.720 --> 58:41.960]  carried out unless everybody is silenced and gas lit that's why truth comes with hard work
[58:41.960 --> 58:46.320]  and with research and with diligence and that's why it's hard to share info or links and band
[58:46.320 --> 58:51.000]  up video links that's why we've got to share them now more than ever you and run contact

[59:12.080 --> 59:16.600]  they come and take quote healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety
[59:16.600 --> 59:20.880]  this is nothing less than martial law and one big thing you can do to fight back is to get
[59:20.880 --> 59:25.440]  high quality fair day cages many of which are made here in america and are very compliant

[1:00:15.600 --> 1:00:25.120]  all right john stone is going to be joining us he is an author he's a filmmaker he's a
[1:00:25.120 --> 1:00:30.640]  friend of mine he did a great job on jessie ventura's show helping produce it exposing
[1:00:30.640 --> 1:00:36.920]  the plane for lockdowns 12 years ago before it happened he's going to be joining us coming
[1:00:36.920 --> 1:00:40.960]  up and i thought anyone was a guest in his own right but his dad obviously is one of
[1:00:40.960 --> 1:00:44.520]  the greatest filmmakers ever all over stone amazing screenwriter but he's an expert on
[1:00:44.520 --> 1:00:49.160]  ukraine but show us john stone who's a world and met with many of these leaders and has
[1:00:49.160 --> 1:00:55.480]  made films about it as well we'll talk about ukraine on fire and more stone in a moment
[1:00:55.480 --> 1:01:01.240]  i'm getting a lot of calls i'm getting a lot of emails and calls and people reaching out
[1:01:01.240 --> 1:01:06.480]  to me including family and they're saying alex what do we do if there's a nuclear war how
[1:01:06.480 --> 1:01:12.400]  do we protect ourselves and i say well don't live near a big military base or key infrastructure
[1:01:12.400 --> 1:01:18.040]  in case there is a strike but also promote peace promote justice promote an awakening
[1:01:18.040 --> 1:01:23.280]  point out the globalist want a war a nuclear war for depopulation in their own doctrine
[1:01:23.280 --> 1:01:27.960]  and that the u.s. and russia have first strike in their doctrine that they may strike the
[1:01:27.960 --> 1:01:37.280]  other country first push our governments to demilitarize when it comes to nuclear weapons
[1:01:37.280 --> 1:01:43.760]  and to not continue to develop new and more deadly weapons that is just common sense but
[1:01:43.760 --> 1:01:47.280]  as long as the new world order is in their pushing tyranny and in pushing division and
[1:01:47.280 --> 1:01:51.560]  pushing proxy wars that's not going to happen so now we're on a verge of a major nuclear
[1:01:51.560 --> 1:01:56.280]  war and many political scientists and analysts around the world believe in fact the majority
[1:01:56.280 --> 1:02:01.920]  do now there's a consensus that the world is in the greatest danger of nuclear war
[1:02:01.920 --> 1:02:08.560]  if ever been in major hedge funds and major banks are out there saying 10 percent chance
[1:02:08.560 --> 1:02:15.800]  of nuclear war in the next six months man that is just such a incredible number and
[1:02:15.800 --> 1:02:20.040]  i tend to agree with that number so i'm seeing a lot of stories out there about iodine being
[1:02:20.040 --> 1:02:26.000]  bought off the shelves medical iodine that's not for ingestion topical iodine that's not
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:31.400]  for ingestion i see the potassium iodide pills that are for nuclear war being bought
[1:02:31.400 --> 1:02:36.320]  off the shelves and i just want people to understand something that that's only for
[1:02:36.320 --> 1:02:43.000]  one type or group of isotopes and is something that helps you with most forms of fallout
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:49.680]  but i don't promote and sell the highest quality deer breath crystal iodine for nuclear fallout
[1:02:49.680 --> 1:02:55.520]  reasons even though it's something that mitigates it some but there's nothing like peace that
[1:02:55.520 --> 1:03:01.120]  mitigates it so it doesn't happen it's essential to all electrochemical activity in the body
[1:03:01.120 --> 1:03:05.880]  and it is essential for your immune system and the UN estimates and i agree with the
[1:03:05.880 --> 1:03:12.320]  number i've looked it up that over two billion people have cognitive disabilities and lower
[1:03:12.320 --> 1:03:20.880]  IQs because of deficiency in iodine china adds it to their salt the u.s. government
[1:03:20.880 --> 1:03:28.720]  used to but now they don't do that they add the bad halogen fluoride bromine bromide chlorine
[1:03:28.720 --> 1:03:32.920]  to the water that does the opposite so out of all the things we sell the things we do
[1:03:32.920 --> 1:03:38.080]  true deep earth crystal iodine with all different three types the atomic iodine and two other
[1:03:38.080 --> 1:03:45.600]  types for better absorption is in x3 and we were ending the sale of x3 at 50% off but
[1:03:45.600 --> 1:03:49.640]  then i noticed everybody was buying it up and i don't want to gouge people during something
[1:03:49.640 --> 1:03:57.720]  like this so we're offering it at 50% off until it sells out x3 50% off for your stamina

[1:05:16.760 --> 1:05:21.920]  unstoppable tank super male volatility really really works it's cold pressed herbs and
[1:05:21.920 --> 1:05:27.840]  natural compounds that have never been heated up and so it has a dramatic effect compared
[1:05:27.840 --> 1:05:32.400]  to powdered versions they also work quite well they just aren't as strong this is like a very
[1:05:32.400 --> 1:05:37.040]  fine wine it's it's it's in fact each batch is different sometimes it's super strong sometimes
[1:05:37.040 --> 1:05:40.600]  it's just okay people like why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch
[1:05:40.600 --> 1:05:46.120]  isn't strong that's just how it is it's how it works so it's always good it's just sometimes
[1:05:46.120 --> 1:05:51.040]  it's like super strong but yeah if you want the rolls Royce at a decent price then this
[1:05:51.040 --> 1:05:52.040]  is it
[1:05:52.040 --> 1:06:05.120]  we are now into hour number two of the sunday edition of the alex jones show an old friend
[1:06:05.120 --> 1:06:11.120]  of mine author film maker john stone joins us he is an expert on geopolitical events
[1:06:11.120 --> 1:06:17.960]  and so is his father who's made the two absolute definitive films on the ongoing ukraine crisis
[1:06:17.960 --> 1:06:23.600]  ukraine on fire and now his latest revealing ukraine ukraine on fire came out what six
[1:06:23.600 --> 1:06:28.120]  seven years ago revealing ukraine two thousand nineteen here's the trailer for revealing
[1:06:28.120 --> 1:06:39.920]  ukraine from oliver stone more clashes in ukraine's capital Kiev what we saw here today
[1:06:39.920 --> 1:06:47.640]  was a revolution I'm an outsider to the situation but I would like to jump into the action in recent
[1:06:47.640 --> 1:06:54.160]  days Kiev has turned into a full scale war zone the events that took place in that period
[1:06:54.160 --> 1:07:00.160]  at first the actions took place peacefully we noticed radicals that were related to the
[1:07:00.160 --> 1:07:12.560]  right party neo-fascist organization was created such an impression that the embassy of the
[1:07:12.560 --> 1:07:26.880]  United States exists the headquarters that controls this process biden vice president but the
[1:07:26.880 --> 1:07:35.240]  thing is that biden said one thing about ukraine the other questions of credibility are being
[1:07:35.240 --> 1:07:41.320]  raised after a private chat between two top u.s. diplomats was leaked online so you had
[1:07:41.320 --> 1:07:46.520]  this remarkable phone call where you have these two senior officials of the u.s. government
[1:07:46.520 --> 1:07:50.360]  apparently talking about a coup or how they were planning to restructure the government
[1:07:50.360 --> 1:08:02.040]  of ukraine we saw in the 1980s the central intelligence agency had been largely discredited
[1:08:02.040 --> 1:08:07.800]  because of scandals that had been exposed in the 1970s they still want to get rid of
[1:08:07.800 --> 1:08:12.280]  certain governments they wanted regime change in Syria for instance regime change in Iran
[1:08:12.280 --> 1:08:17.040]  and they have a lot of allies now inside the news media inside the government and that means
[1:08:17.040 --> 1:08:26.360]  that they can do a lot to control the narrative and it works with the american people nato has
[1:08:26.360 --> 1:08:34.320]  expanded into 13 countries why we are so sharp we react to the expansion of us when the country
[1:08:34.320 --> 1:08:39.120]  becomes a member of NATO it is already very difficult to resist pressure from the side of such a
[1:08:39.120 --> 1:08:44.200]  large country the leader of NATO as the United States and there it is easy to appear it can
[1:08:44.200 --> 1:08:52.320]  be anything against missile defense and new bases and if you need a new strike complex and we
[1:08:52.320 --> 1:08:57.600]  what to do the United States is imposing new sanctions and key sectors of the Russian economy
[1:08:57.600 --> 1:09:03.240]  after the third wave of sanctions hit Russia the tensions between the two countries skyrocketed
[1:09:03.240 --> 1:09:16.000]  so the question presents itself are we truly witnessing the beginning of cold war 2.0 well
[1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:22.480]  you talk about tomorrow's news today Oliver Stone knocking it completely out of the park
[1:09:22.480 --> 1:09:30.440]  and we've got his author filmmaker son in his own right good friend of mine one of the help
[1:09:30.440 --> 1:09:37.560]  produced the great Jesse Ventura series that exposed covid-19 12 years before they launched
[1:09:37.560 --> 1:09:44.480]  it Sean stone info Sean stone joins us and he's a media host author actor poet speaker and above
[1:09:44.480 --> 1:09:51.200]  all truth seeker and spiritual activist Sean great to have you on man did your dad and also
[1:09:51.200 --> 1:09:56.560]  you've been out there warning of this call this way in advance thank you so much for joining us
[1:09:56.560 --> 1:10:00.280]  tonight we're also gonna talk about your new book and I'm gonna read as soon as I get it new
[1:10:00.280 --> 1:10:06.000]  world order a strategy of imperialism we'll talk about that as well coming up in about 20 minutes
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:12.280]  but first wow good to see you there on the video and where do you want to start wherever you like
[1:10:12.280 --> 1:10:17.240]  I think that Ukraine on fire trailer really sums it up doesn't it when what strikes you in that
[1:10:17.240 --> 1:10:20.920]  video it's very much a color revolution that we said we've been those of us that have paying
[1:10:20.920 --> 1:10:25.240]  attention sought all to the 2000s right when we start first started hearing about Soros's
[1:10:25.240 --> 1:10:31.920]  color revolutions in the former Soviet countries you know in Georgia Ukraine you name it Azerbaijan
[1:10:31.920 --> 1:10:37.160]  right there were just countless of these also in the North Africa and Egypt and whatnot so you're
[1:10:37.160 --> 1:10:40.440]  just seeing you know you you're seeing that strategy and what's amazing to me is that's
[1:10:40.440 --> 1:10:44.960]  obviously you know you saw the tensions heating up in 2014 in Ukraine well then they turn the
[1:10:44.960 --> 1:10:49.320]  color revolution here because because Trump won in 2016 so they had to target Trump right he
[1:10:49.320 --> 1:10:54.120]  got in the way of their plan which was really to do what they're doing now back in 2017 with
[1:10:54.120 --> 1:11:00.560]  Hillary and Biden was running the whole show they admit what is it like for you to be right in the
[1:11:00.560 --> 1:11:04.600]  middle of this traveling the world talking to world leaders making your own films and books
[1:11:04.600 --> 1:11:09.400]  you're just like your dad but from your own perspective to see him show right now because
[1:11:09.400 --> 1:11:14.080]  this is like a time machine it's like your dad had been in a time machine of the future and now
[1:11:14.080 --> 1:11:19.560]  everybody's rediscovering these already hit films hit documentaries he made that just absolutely
[1:11:19.560 --> 1:11:25.440]  nailed it yeah yeah well again I mean remember this this was a huge issue at that time period
[1:11:25.440 --> 1:11:30.960]  of the 20 you know post 2014 what do we hear they were screaming all that all the you know
[1:11:30.960 --> 1:11:35.040]  the Romney's and the Democrats and everybody was screaming about Russia right we saw the
[1:11:35.040 --> 1:11:41.840]  new Cold War at that time period in 2015 2016 and then the only thing that stopped it was was
[1:11:41.840 --> 1:11:46.080]  Trump right because Trump was saying look you know we're Nate we're America first we don't
[1:11:46.080 --> 1:11:49.480]  necessarily want to stick with NATO you know the screw NATO you know the history of
[1:11:49.480 --> 1:11:54.760]  NATO as you know Alex I mean NATO is very much constructed off of former Nazi apparatuses
[1:11:54.760 --> 1:11:58.760]  you know there's Operation Gladio which anyone I'm sure familiar with their show
[1:11:58.760 --> 1:12:02.080]  lay that out because a lot of people haven't written books on the subject like you have
[1:12:02.080 --> 1:12:07.760]  explained to people that Putin is not making this up no no he's not making this up back
[1:12:07.760 --> 1:12:14.160]  and okay think about just take Ukraine there was Operation Nightingale which was run by
[1:12:14.160 --> 1:12:20.600]  by ex-Nazis and Frank Wisner are one of our deputies the CIA been late 40s setting up
[1:12:20.600 --> 1:12:25.560]  stay behind armies doing assassinations all kinds of disruptions in the Ukraine at that
[1:12:25.560 --> 1:12:30.760]  time period which is part of the Soviet Empire at that time right that's just one of many
[1:12:30.760 --> 1:12:36.880]  examples there was Gladio which was the NATO operation all through the post World War era
[1:12:36.880 --> 1:12:40.960]  and there were a lot of fascist ex-Nazis that were part of the NATO apparatus right I mean
[1:12:40.960 --> 1:12:45.000]  people may have heard of Reinhardt Galen right who was one of the instrumental founders
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:51.120]  of the CIA and he was a former Nazi intelligence head who was focused on on this on the Soviets
[1:12:51.120 --> 1:12:57.000]  during the World War so a lot of as we know paperclip in America House Barbie all of them
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:01.160]  exactly that's the best way to put it Ukraine had some of the biggest stay behind networks
[1:13:01.160 --> 1:13:08.040]  ever put in it and they use Nazi networks the CIA did to do that because the Nazis had
[1:13:08.040 --> 1:13:12.880]  occupied Ukraine for four years so they have the networks already in place and those networks
[1:13:12.880 --> 1:13:18.560]  have still been there till today exactly I mean they were the NATO itself as I said
[1:13:18.560 --> 1:13:23.440]  was based on the Nazi infrastructure of fighting the Soviets right that's what NATO was designed
[1:13:23.440 --> 1:13:28.280]  for so to sit here and go why is NATO still in existence when the Soviet Union collapsed
[1:13:28.280 --> 1:13:35.200]  in 91 right why do you have NATO as a designed as an anti-Russian alliance and by the way
[1:13:35.200 --> 1:13:39.720]  doesn't this go against George Washington our founding fathers say no entangling alliance
[1:13:39.720 --> 1:13:42.760]  Trump should have got us out of NATO that Bolton's right and Trump would have got us
[1:13:42.760 --> 1:13:46.920]  out in this time period in the second term good for him we should not be part of NATO
[1:13:46.920 --> 1:13:50.760]  this is an entangling alliance that does not serve America's interests this has nothing
[1:13:50.760 --> 1:13:55.560]  to do with American security there's no doubt that wouldn't have invaded if NATO was not
[1:13:55.560 --> 1:14:01.280]  trying to basically pump arms into Ukraine as a proxy war that's an act of war I'm not
[1:14:01.280 --> 1:14:05.480]  glad that Putin invaded but what did people expecting to do your father made a film what
[1:14:05.480 --> 1:14:10.320]  six seven years ago warning this would happen and now it has that's right the problem is
[1:14:10.320 --> 1:14:13.520]  that you have too many people especially in the Western world who don't know their asses
[1:14:13.520 --> 1:14:17.160]  from their mouth so all they do is talk shit and you're talking about someone like Putin
[1:14:17.160 --> 1:14:23.040]  who actually said does what he says I'm sorry it's a different capacity of leadership when
[1:14:23.040 --> 1:14:29.360]  Putin said Ukraine and Georgia are not going to join NATO back in 2008 why do we think
[1:14:29.360 --> 1:14:33.360]  that he wasn't going to stand by his word why do we why do we treat Russia like some
[1:14:33.360 --> 1:14:38.920]  third-rate dictatorship like Iraq or Syria or Libya that we can just overthrow and obviously
[1:14:38.920 --> 1:14:42.680]  we've seen what happened right we went we overthrow these governments we support coup
[1:14:42.680 --> 1:14:47.560]  we support terrorists against these against Syria I mean Russia's a different caliber
[1:14:47.560 --> 1:14:50.720]  Russia's the biggest country in the world geographically it's got the second largest
[1:14:50.720 --> 1:14:56.800]  nuclear weapons arsenal again exactly they're starting a fight they're they're writing checks
[1:14:56.800 --> 1:15:00.640]  that we can't cash whether people want to kill Putin or not whether he's the devil or
[1:15:00.640 --> 1:15:06.840]  a good guy this is not tenable and the American establishment is insane that's that's the
[1:15:06.840 --> 1:15:12.080]  point this is the liberal establishment of Soros of Biden of Clinton and I say liberal
[1:15:12.080 --> 1:15:15.400]  I mean bushes are part of this Chinese are a part of it but it's a liberal ideology of
[1:15:15.400 --> 1:15:20.320]  globalism as you know and my new world order book talks about it's a global agenda right
[1:15:20.320 --> 1:15:25.760]  the idea is to bring all of these countries under one world financial control right IMF
[1:15:25.760 --> 1:15:29.520]  structures that's what they've done to the Ukraine revealing Ukraine exposes how Ukraine
[1:15:29.520 --> 1:15:35.000]  was the richest country committed Soviet Union what happened to it now as the I know you're
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:38.800]  an expert on this you know more about it than I do we'll talk about it and more and your
[1:15:38.800 --> 1:15:43.600]  new book everybody can get it Amazon.com and other places new world order a strategy of
[1:15:43.600 --> 1:15:48.200]  imperialism and it's all about what you see happening right now get his new book right
[1:15:48.200 --> 1:15:57.360]  now it's got four and a half stars get it today new world order Sean Stone the purpose
[1:15:57.360 --> 1:16:03.440]  of fear is to call us into action and there is plenty to be afraid of today half the population
[1:16:03.440 --> 1:16:09.000]  has lined up for an untested deadly and debilitating experimental injection because they were told
[1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:14.320]  to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease the perpetrators of all this have clearly
[1:16:14.320 --> 1:16:19.920]  stated their goal of having 80% of the population hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive
[1:16:19.920 --> 1:16:25.200]  mind in less than nine years for those of us who have awoken from the spell we know this
[1:16:25.200 --> 1:16:30.200]  is all really happening and it's unbelievably unsettling to see but there is only two things
[1:16:30.200 --> 1:16:35.800]  to do we continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game if enough people awaken
[1:16:35.800 --> 1:16:41.300]  from the cold spell then we win but even when we win and we eventually will the days of
[1:16:41.300 --> 1:16:46.280]  convenience are soon coming to an end and so we must prepare get up to a year's worth

[1:18:30.960 --> 1:18:35.240]  and never came back in because the lockdowns and supply chain breakouts we were sold out
[1:18:35.240 --> 1:18:39.840]  of x3 for a long time and I had it on sale for 50% off a lot of folks were getting it
[1:18:39.840 --> 1:18:43.680]  and I was thinking you know what I'm going to bring it back on sale again just until
[1:18:43.680 --> 1:18:47.520]  it sells out because even though we won't make as much money in the long run a lot of
[1:18:47.520 --> 1:18:51.640]  folks need this product and we need to get the money from the sales in now to stay on

[1:19:06.760 --> 1:19:13.280]  of our flagship product x3 that has all three types of the amazing iodine your body needs

[1:19:30.160 --> 1:19:35.240]  half of what we have or isn't going to come in for a long time so I took it back to full
[1:19:35.240 --> 1:19:39.520]  products and I was just thinking you know what we need to funds in now to stay on air
[1:19:39.520 --> 1:19:44.000]  plus this is a great product everybody needs so to incentivize folks out there that have
[1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:48.040]  been on the fence to get x3 and experience it for yourself and support the broadcast

[1:19:54.560 --> 1:20:04.360]  for 50% off leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[1:20:04.360 --> 1:20:24.120]  well I've known Shawn stone like 15 years maybe longer but got doing really well working
[1:20:24.120 --> 1:20:28.520]  on the production of Jesse Ventura's TV show that was so groundbreaking got censored much
[1:20:28.520 --> 1:20:33.200]  the episodes we worked on got banned and you go find those banned episodes online people
[1:20:33.200 --> 1:20:38.160]  just freaked out over tens of millions of views more views for the show now in the future
[1:20:38.160 --> 1:20:41.760]  than when it got back then and it was very very popular back then had millions of viewers
[1:20:41.760 --> 1:20:49.200]  then Shawn stone is not overshadowed by his towering father who makes so many serious
[1:20:49.200 --> 1:20:54.720]  also interesting films like JFK the list goes on and on really what Hollywood's missing
[1:20:54.720 --> 1:20:59.600]  today but he in his own right international journalists produces international TV programs
[1:20:59.600 --> 1:21:06.600]  news programs author filmmaker so much more and when he talks about Ukraine and Europe
[1:21:06.600 --> 1:21:11.320]  and Russia he knows what he's talking about now I talk about Cecil Rhodes and the globalists
[1:21:11.320 --> 1:21:15.840]  and the model they use his book is about that he goes deeper than I've even gone we're going
[1:21:15.840 --> 1:21:19.880]  to talk about that in the next two segments but in this shorter segment continue to give
[1:21:19.880 --> 1:21:24.880]  us your view and your understanding of what's happening in Europe and how you because not
[1:21:24.880 --> 1:21:29.120]  just your dad back with a Ukraine on fire seven years ago in this new film a couple
[1:21:29.120 --> 1:21:33.480]  years ago but you are coming on my show warning of this six seven eight years ago as well
[1:21:33.480 --> 1:21:40.760]  so you have really been on this why did you see this coming so far away because there's
[1:21:40.760 --> 1:21:45.280]  an inability to the globalist to the globalist push right and not globalization itself which
[1:21:45.280 --> 1:21:49.360]  is to say we've always been globalized in some capacity since you know the days of
[1:21:49.360 --> 1:21:55.840]  Alexander the great right connecting empires I mean trade trade is one thing forcing forcing
[1:21:55.840 --> 1:22:01.000]  debt slavery on people's whole other issue what happened really it seems since 2014
[1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:05.720]  was the Europe basically trying to enforce a deal with Ukraine that's why they got rid
[1:22:05.720 --> 1:22:09.720]  of Yanukovych because he was he didn't want to take the deal that was basically to say
[1:22:09.720 --> 1:22:14.720]  you have to take loans from us you have to be part of the IMF Europe European community
[1:22:14.720 --> 1:22:18.640]  as far as finances concerned that's why they ousted Yanukovych because he wanted to take
[1:22:18.640 --> 1:22:24.240]  a loan from Russia right so I mean Putin's perspective is look Ukraine should be neutral
[1:22:24.240 --> 1:22:29.160]  Ukraine should be able to deal with both both Europe and Russia it shouldn't be it shouldn't
[1:22:29.160 --> 1:22:34.520]  be one or the other but post 2014 that you've seen it was research and nationalism right
[1:22:34.520 --> 1:22:38.600]  that's very much staked with some of these neo-nazis you know that have infiltrated the
[1:22:38.600 --> 1:22:43.480]  military the government so you know Zelensky you know as Jewish sure but doesn't mean that
[1:22:43.480 --> 1:22:49.120]  he's not beholden to Kolomoisky and these oligarchs right that are completely Kolomoisky
[1:22:49.120 --> 1:22:52.880]  wasn't he was banned from America I think Glenn Beck did a great segment about Kolomoisky
[1:22:52.880 --> 1:22:56.960]  he was banned from America till Biden got him free because Kolomoisky was backing Hunter
[1:22:56.960 --> 1:23:01.040]  Biden's barisma deal right so we've heard about barisma and this whole thing with Joe
[1:23:01.040 --> 1:23:05.000]  Biden his son Hunter Biden getting deals well they're very it's really connected to the
[1:23:05.000 --> 1:23:08.880]  oligarchs running Ukraine and guess who's one probably the second most powerful person
[1:23:08.880 --> 1:23:14.400]  in Ukraine is George Soros Soros has been all over this place funding the various organization
[1:23:14.400 --> 1:23:19.080]  you know various anti-corruption things well guess what that's exactly how they run corruption
[1:23:19.080 --> 1:23:23.680]  right when Biden fired the prosecutor who was investigating barisma and Hunter Biden
[1:23:23.680 --> 1:23:28.800]  and Kolomoisky and all these characters you know Biden fired him right had him fired back
[1:23:28.800 --> 1:23:33.880]  in 2015 1415 16 time period that's right he brags about it and you know when you talk
[1:23:33.880 --> 1:23:38.880]  about Nazis just interrupters it's so important it's all over you saying Trump's a Nazi when
[1:23:38.880 --> 1:23:43.800]  he was so pro-Israel or I'm a Nazi or anybody that questions critical race theories a Nazi
[1:23:43.800 --> 1:23:48.040]  when we're actually opposing Nazi like ideology of people are bad because of what color they
[1:23:48.040 --> 1:23:53.800]  are that's the Nazis do these are real Nazis the most real Nazis in the world are in places
[1:23:53.800 --> 1:23:59.320]  like Ukraine not all of them but a large minority and that is a fact this is not debatable these
[1:23:59.320 --> 1:24:06.520]  people hold positions in parliament they literally do the howl Hitler salute and wear swastikas
[1:24:06.520 --> 1:24:10.920]  so when our media tries to ignore that it totally discredits everything else they have
[1:24:10.920 --> 1:24:16.760]  to say of course I mean they're they're ignore the fact that we back in 2016 the Congress
[1:24:16.760 --> 1:24:21.400]  and initially Congress was trying to stop putting money towards the Ukraine because
[1:24:21.400 --> 1:24:26.320]  the Azov militia was integrated right into into the Ukrainian military and the Azov
[1:24:26.320 --> 1:24:30.680]  is notoriously a not a neo-nazi battalion and so originally they said well we can't fund
[1:24:30.680 --> 1:24:35.000]  you and then quietly they do it and and there was even talk about this back in 2016 you
[1:24:35.000 --> 1:24:39.480]  know wow the Azov is neo-nazis but then ever since then they've just hushed up and you
[1:24:39.480 --> 1:24:43.360]  know it's it's again it's just continuous these people are hypocrites as we know you
[1:24:43.360 --> 1:24:46.960]  know within their establishment within the media they are hypocrites why is it that they
[1:24:46.960 --> 1:24:52.680]  were you know the same CNN that was pro pro war against Serbia pro war against Baghdad
[1:24:52.680 --> 1:24:57.240]  pro war against Libya you know pro war against Syria all of a sudden it's oh no we're anti
[1:24:57.240 --> 1:25:00.720]  war give me a break these people are they're arming Ukraine what do you think is going
[1:25:00.720 --> 1:25:05.360]  to happen I mean do you did they not understand that Ukraine is it's like Mexico or Cuba to
[1:25:05.360 --> 1:25:09.200]  us I mean of course Russia would fight over it if we had if Russia or China was putting
[1:25:09.200 --> 1:25:16.080]  missiles in in Mexico you don't think people would have a problem with that here Sean again
[1:25:16.080 --> 1:25:23.200]  you predicted this you did interviews you did reports on it now tell me what you think
[1:25:23.200 --> 1:25:27.680]  is coming next because you have such a deep understanding of this I want to know my family
[1:25:27.680 --> 1:25:31.880]  wants to know the losers want to know as somebody's been a trailblazer and it's just true folks
[1:25:31.880 --> 1:25:36.360]  I know I'm gushing I gush over people that are accurate way beforehand that's what I'm
[1:25:36.360 --> 1:25:41.440]  always searching for that's that's the holy grail of news and information is people that
[1:25:41.440 --> 1:25:45.600]  really understand subjects what do you and your circle of researchers that I know are
[1:25:45.600 --> 1:25:52.360]  some of the best think is about to happen look I mean the Russians I see the Russians
[1:25:52.360 --> 1:25:56.040]  being very smart very calculating the media keeps saying that they're losing I just see
[1:25:56.040 --> 1:26:00.080]  them as they're not trying to take civilian casualties I mean that's the point Russia
[1:26:00.080 --> 1:26:06.680]  Russia sees Ukraine as their cousins at 1900 it was Kev Russia okay this they are they are
[1:26:06.680 --> 1:26:11.560]  the same people now there is it there is a dramatic faction that's in the you know that's
[1:26:11.560 --> 1:26:16.680]  Western Ukraine there is the blonde blonde eye blonde blonde and blue eyed faction within
[1:26:16.680 --> 1:26:20.040]  Ukraine so it's not to say that they're all Ukrainians are Russians but at least half
[1:26:20.040 --> 1:26:24.800]  the country is ethnically Russian speaks Russian so Russia is not going in there to
[1:26:24.800 --> 1:26:28.720]  destroy Ukraine they are systematically it seems going after biolabs going after the
[1:26:28.720 --> 1:26:33.520]  military trying to make it neutral as Putin said it should be like a neutral Switzerland
[1:26:33.520 --> 1:26:38.960]  type of country between the West and Russia that's his attitude now I've heard from military
[1:26:38.960 --> 1:26:42.660]  intel that they're what that the Ukraine was pushing for nukes now whether or not they
[1:26:42.660 --> 1:26:46.440]  actually have developed them I've heard breaking stuff I haven't confirmed it that the Russians
[1:26:46.440 --> 1:26:51.720]  did find as a lens you said he wanted news no I think that doesn't see so I see one
[1:26:51.720 --> 1:26:57.040]  and I've actually heard again not confirmed but from Intel Intel people saying yes the
[1:26:57.040 --> 1:27:01.800]  Russians did find they have dirty bomb or some kind of nuclear capacity that they have
[1:27:01.800 --> 1:27:07.720]  been working on in Ukraine please continue that's just the most breaking thing I've
[1:27:07.720 --> 1:27:11.600]  heard and that came from a few days ago and then I was someone else told me that independently
[1:27:11.600 --> 1:27:16.640]  today that they found it so this is coming from high level military in the Russian side
[1:27:16.640 --> 1:27:20.880]  so that's why I say I can't confirm it but it does seem that this is a major aspect of
[1:27:20.880 --> 1:27:25.280]  why Putin decided to move if there was not only the biolabs issue there's as we've heard
[1:27:25.280 --> 1:27:30.160]  about genetic warfare things you know as far as genetic smallpox things like this but actual
[1:27:30.160 --> 1:27:35.640]  nuclear dirty bomb type of capabilities being developed in Ukraine by the way the Russians
[1:27:35.640 --> 1:27:39.800]  came out a week ago and said that they found all these bioweapon labs and the media called
[1:27:39.800 --> 1:27:44.400]  it fake news but we went and looked up old articles in Reuters and you name it admitting
[1:27:44.400 --> 1:27:50.160]  the US built level four bioweapon labs we did a whole report on it Pentagon funded biolabs
[1:27:50.160 --> 1:27:54.640]  in the Ukraine banned out video so that's a fact that that's going on and our media
[1:27:54.640 --> 1:27:59.120]  says it's not true Sean well our media is a bunch of liars I mean come on didn't we
[1:27:59.120 --> 1:28:03.440]  figure that out during the Kosovo war I figured that out Kosovo by the time of Iraq I knew
[1:28:03.440 --> 1:28:07.360]  that there were no WMDs there I know I was listening to Scott Ritter at Princeton he
[1:28:07.360 --> 1:28:11.160]  came and said look you know I was the UN and I was into one of the UN chiefs of this you
[1:28:11.160 --> 1:28:15.760]  know looking into Iraq they don't have WMDs this is made up but guess what do the UN believe
[1:28:15.760 --> 1:28:20.560]  the UN believed a little vile of white stuff I mean let's be honest these people are crooked
[1:28:20.560 --> 1:28:26.160]  as they come you're right I want to get into your book when we come back and by the way
[1:28:26.160 --> 1:28:28.640]  I'm going to order a bunch of these I haven't read it yet but I know it's going to be excellent
[1:28:28.640 --> 1:28:32.240]  because I've read your other works and you're just dead on when it comes to the Anglo-American
[1:28:32.240 --> 1:28:38.160]  establishment who really runs the New World order what is the Anglo-American establishment
[1:28:38.160 --> 1:28:42.480]  ladies and gentlemen that doesn't mean white people it's it's a specific name where is
[1:28:42.480 --> 1:28:46.400]  it coming from where is it going who are the different power blocks where does he see it
[1:28:46.400 --> 1:28:50.960]  all ending and how can we the common people get involved and stop this global conquest
[1:28:50.960 --> 1:28:52.320]  Sean Stone's our guest stay with us
[1:28:55.920 --> 1:29:02.080]  I am a worldly person meaning I like going to ball games I like going to concerts I like
[1:29:02.080 --> 1:29:07.600]  going to play golf I like going out to dinner I like the metropolitan life I like everything
[1:29:07.600 --> 1:29:14.240]  that comes with this but see I have the survival instinct that is to get the hell out of Democrat
[1:29:14.240 --> 1:29:19.680]  run cities get the hell out of major metropolitan areas because unless we change course soon it's
[1:29:19.680 --> 1:29:24.080]  all crashing down is it time to just move out to the woods just time to go get a piece of
[1:29:24.080 --> 1:29:28.560]  property in the woods just get off grid just get the emergency food supplies just live off the land
[1:29:28.560 --> 1:29:32.800]  that's the survival instinct but see the worldly part of me that's still probably the majority
[1:29:32.800 --> 1:29:38.000]  part of me says no no no no stay in the city the survival instinct says get the hell out of
[1:29:38.000 --> 1:29:41.920]  anywhere they've ever noticed that you need to get a vaccine or a mask that's the that's the
[1:29:41.920 --> 1:29:48.000]  internal struggle that my guess is a lot of you in the audience are facing as well but you can at
[1:29:48.000 --> 1:29:53.040]  least have some comfort if you have the emergency food supplies and so we have the best ones at
[1:29:53.040 --> 1:29:59.600]  inforwarstore.com Mike in California thanks for calling I think we're barking up the wrong tree
[1:29:59.600 --> 1:30:05.520]  calling this gain of function research now if you read the actual you know 2014 legislation the US
[1:30:05.520 --> 1:30:11.440]  government gain of function deliberative process and research funding pause on selected gain of
[1:30:11.440 --> 1:30:17.040]  function research involving influenza MERS and SARS viruses there's nothing about SARS like viruses
[1:30:17.040 --> 1:30:21.920]  and it's a research funding pause it's not a stop it's not a prohibition it's when you come to a
[1:30:21.920 --> 1:30:26.720]  four-way intersection there's the stop sign you stop you look both ways and then you proceed and so
[1:30:26.720 --> 1:30:31.680]  it's also it doesn't pause all gain of function just selected gain of function but they'll argue
[1:30:31.680 --> 1:30:36.720]  that this is actually characterization and qualification research so you know Rand and
[1:30:36.720 --> 1:30:40.320]  the others you know maybe Fauci was right they don't quite know what they're talking about calling
[1:30:40.320 --> 1:30:44.320]  a gain of function you know that's why he didn't perjure himself that's why he hasn't been arrested
[1:30:44.320 --> 1:30:48.960]  because they're literally creating new synthetic life forms that mimic what the viruses do but in
[1:30:48.960 --> 1:30:53.440]  the main definition it's still a gain of function you're making something deadly that spreads more
[1:30:53.440 --> 1:31:00.560]  easily to hurt people thank you Mike we love you I stay on air selling high quality products that you
[1:31:00.560 --> 1:31:05.200]  need that you want and that you're going to be happy with that's why you come back and buy
[1:31:05.200 --> 1:31:10.880]  products from me again it's a symbiotic relationship I promote liberty I promote freedom I fight the
[1:31:10.880 --> 1:31:15.760]  globalist and I'm able to do that because you buy products and info or store.com and listen
[1:31:15.760 --> 1:31:20.880]  all the products are great but when it comes to high quality storeable food in an inflationary
[1:31:20.880 --> 1:31:27.920]  system with major supply chain breakdowns this is an absolute 360 win a no-brainer and they've
[1:31:27.920 --> 1:31:31.840]  got high quality storeable food ready to ship to you right now the great folks at my page
[1:31:31.840 --> 1:31:39.040]  resupply exclusively preparealex.com discounted so again beat inflation be prepared fund the info
[1:31:39.040 --> 1:31:45.680]  war the only way you lose is not taking action at infowarstore.com or prepare with alex.com right
[1:31:45.680 --> 1:31:50.640]  now this is high quality storeable food this is how you beat inflation get yours today it's ready
[1:31:50.640 --> 1:31:55.440]  to ship but I wouldn't wait because prices are about to go up because inflation is exploding
[1:31:55.440 --> 1:32:02.720]  it has been noted by many a historian the first casualty of war is the truth then the next big
[1:32:02.720 --> 1:32:10.720]  casualty isn't even the people that die no that invariably follows but first there is the crackdown
[1:32:10.720 --> 1:32:18.400]  on populations basic liberty and speech and massive censorship and now across the world
[1:32:18.400 --> 1:32:27.280]  from the united states to europe legislation's being introduced that if you amplify any quote pro
[1:32:27.280 --> 1:32:34.800]  russian information you can be censored you can be arrested you can be imprisoned and of course now
[1:32:34.800 --> 1:32:40.960]  Canada's introduced legislation that if you have a thought crime and they think you may have the
[1:32:40.960 --> 1:32:47.600]  intent to engage in hate speech online that you will be censored and arrested ladies and gentlemen
[1:32:47.600 --> 1:32:52.560]  the authoritarianism is being carried out by the globalists around the world against humanity
[1:32:52.560 --> 1:32:54.800]  that makes info wars dot com more important than ever
[1:32:54.800 --> 1:33:15.440]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[1:33:15.440 --> 1:33:25.520]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[1:33:26.720 --> 1:33:34.000]  world war one world war two the cold war it was all about global empire who is the most
[1:33:34.000 --> 1:33:40.240]  powerful combine in the world is it the russians is it the chinese or is it the globalist
[1:33:40.240 --> 1:33:44.560]  well we know it's the globalist but who are the globalist i mean they write books about themselves
[1:33:44.560 --> 1:33:53.040]  they brag about their plan goes back to cecil roads over 130 years ago and i know he's made
[1:33:53.040 --> 1:33:57.440]  films on it i've seen the reports he's done he's traveled the world exposing it and now he's written
[1:33:57.440 --> 1:34:03.760]  a book about it so if you want to understand the russia phobia and and and why these powerful
[1:34:03.760 --> 1:34:09.120]  globalist forces are hellbent on taking over russia and why george soros brags that he will
[1:34:09.120 --> 1:34:14.800]  be the emperor of russia i played that clip at the start of the show why do they have such enmity
[1:34:14.800 --> 1:34:19.680]  and where is this all going well i would postulate the globalist created the communist state of
[1:34:19.680 --> 1:34:24.960]  china it's kind of double cross them and and that's a beautiful thing because i don't defend gg
[1:34:24.960 --> 1:34:29.680]  ping i think he's a super tyrant uh you know compared to to somebody like putin who's more
[1:34:29.680 --> 1:34:35.920]  of a strong man and then we have the really true sophisticated evil perched on top america and europe
[1:34:35.920 --> 1:34:41.840]  in my view that is sucking off of us and hates us as much as they hate the russians so i see that
[1:34:41.840 --> 1:34:47.920]  americans and russians really have the same foe we're just more occupied by it and through trump
[1:34:47.920 --> 1:34:52.240]  and populism we're trying to throw off that yoke that's probably an oversimplification but i want
[1:34:52.240 --> 1:34:58.080]  to get shon stones expert view on that the new book new world order a strategy of imperialism
[1:34:58.080 --> 1:35:04.640]  get yours today please get bookstores and of course amazon.com and shon stone.info so shon
[1:35:04.640 --> 1:35:09.280]  please continue and lay out the book for us yeah i'll just give i'll give a plug real quick people
[1:35:09.280 --> 1:35:13.280]  can contact me through shon stone.info if they want a signed copy of the book that that's another
[1:35:13.280 --> 1:35:19.760]  option um so the book i mean you know we talk about who's the head it's very difficult to look at
[1:35:19.760 --> 1:35:22.880]  who's the head of the serpent right but a lot of people talk about world economic forum these days
[1:35:22.880 --> 1:35:27.600]  right that's become part of the common parlance that that's definitely the mouth of it my view
[1:35:27.600 --> 1:35:33.360]  that's definitely the spokesperson exactly and who so who trained claus schwab well schwab was trained
[1:35:33.360 --> 1:35:38.080]  by kissinger amongst others right but that's fascinating because my book is about kissinger's
[1:35:38.080 --> 1:35:44.080]  lineage and how he was trained uh very much through uh his mentor at harvard william yandale
[1:35:44.080 --> 1:35:49.280]  elliot who was a disciple of the round tables of england and the round table factions really were
[1:35:49.280 --> 1:35:54.640]  born from as you mentioned cesil rose not the first globalist certainly in the tradition of
[1:35:54.640 --> 1:35:59.440]  imperialists uh who was who was his banker it was one it was lord rottchild i believe uh
[1:35:59.440 --> 1:36:04.640]  the nathan rottchild i believe so the rottchild's basically being very introly connected to this
[1:36:04.640 --> 1:36:11.600]  whole operation um which shouldn't surprise people who've studied uh globalization right i mean the
[1:36:11.600 --> 1:36:16.400]  power of the rottchild banking system obviously the rockefellers and other other elite families
[1:36:16.400 --> 1:36:21.120]  but i also would argue that these are new money compared to maybe some of the older families
[1:36:21.120 --> 1:36:25.920]  that that are behind the scenes uh very much you know really connected to this to this whole
[1:36:25.920 --> 1:36:31.840]  apparatus of finance like the sex coberg gophos and then those folks oh sure i mean that's that's
[1:36:31.840 --> 1:36:37.600]  i guess the queen's family is connected to the to them but ultimately it's like you know who finances
[1:36:37.600 --> 1:36:42.720]  uh the governments who who controls the central banks who puts people into debt because that's
[1:36:42.720 --> 1:36:46.720]  ultimately what this is always about right it's creating uh debt slavery i was mentioning with
[1:36:46.720 --> 1:36:51.840]  the ukraine uh before into commercial that basically the end of the soviet era that ukraine was
[1:36:51.840 --> 1:36:56.000]  was the richest wealthiest republic it was an industrialized nation what do they do to ukraine
[1:36:56.000 --> 1:37:00.320]  the same thing they've been doing to america deindustrialize it basically make it such that
[1:37:00.320 --> 1:37:05.440]  people become debt slaves that they're uh this one lady put it on french tv she's like people are
[1:37:05.440 --> 1:37:10.080]  putting half their paychecks every month to their their gas to their electric and gas you know and
[1:37:10.080 --> 1:37:15.920]  heating i mean it's crazy that's what soros in the full c span interview i saw from 2015 was bragging
[1:37:15.920 --> 1:37:21.040]  how he basically was already infiltrating it when russia controlled it and and and and how he's
[1:37:21.040 --> 1:37:26.560]  been in control the whole time and it's basically sucking it dry just as you just said exactly it's
[1:37:26.560 --> 1:37:30.640]  it's always about getting basically getting put people into debt slavery that's really the globalist
[1:37:30.640 --> 1:37:35.920]  agenda and so the more that they can use international bodies to do so you know like the imf and
[1:37:35.920 --> 1:37:40.560]  world bank it was we've seen throughout the late you know the the cold war era john perkins talks
[1:37:40.560 --> 1:37:46.400]  about this very clearly uh john perkins talks about this in his book the confessions of an
[1:37:46.400 --> 1:37:51.120]  economic hitman right talks about how you know they put these countries into into into debt
[1:37:51.120 --> 1:37:55.920]  deep debt that they can't afford to pay off and they basically go into these austerity programs so
[1:37:55.920 --> 1:38:00.160]  this there's always these different apparatuses but ultimately the drive is to centralize power and
[1:38:00.160 --> 1:38:04.400]  we saw it in 2020 era i mean it was fascinating to watch all through this covet debacle how it was
[1:38:04.400 --> 1:38:10.000]  like the world health organization and all these non uh non-democratic bodies are dictating you know
[1:38:10.000 --> 1:38:15.200]  how to how to respond to uh to uh to uh to a bad cold i mean it was insanity right but again this
[1:38:15.200 --> 1:38:18.880]  is surrendering power because what is the real target of the new world order the new world orders
[1:38:18.880 --> 1:38:24.880]  target is america america is the only country in the world premised on the idea that god gives us
[1:38:24.880 --> 1:38:31.040]  divinely equality and sovereignty that we empowered the government no the country in the world does
[1:38:31.040 --> 1:38:35.920]  that every other country says the government which used to be a king or an empire gave the people some
[1:38:35.920 --> 1:38:41.440]  rights the the declaration independence and the constitution say no god gave you the right as a
[1:38:41.440 --> 1:38:45.840]  human being and we empower the government and those powers we don't give the federal government or
[1:38:45.840 --> 1:38:51.920]  reserve to the states and the people they're in and that is why they hate america man you are
[1:38:51.920 --> 1:38:56.480]  preaching it rather and you know we've gotten to know each other pretty good over the years and i
[1:38:56.480 --> 1:39:01.840]  know you've had a chance to get into some of the highest levels of things where you didn't sell out
[1:39:01.840 --> 1:39:07.040]  they bring you in and see if you want to be part of that particular arm i've had a chance to you
[1:39:07.040 --> 1:39:12.880]  know meet with some of those organizations and groups it's all different heads of the same hydra
[1:39:13.680 --> 1:39:20.400]  but looking at it what is their end game i see it as total domination a global social credit score
[1:39:20.400 --> 1:39:24.800]  to be able to control every aspect of our lives literally the biblical mark of the beast to then
[1:39:24.800 --> 1:39:31.120]  force us to give up our humanity in exchange for being able to even live i mean i really see this
[1:39:31.120 --> 1:39:37.760]  as an alien takeover and i don't say little green men are flying saucers but a spiritual dimensional
[1:39:39.040 --> 1:39:48.240]  takeover of the natural order of humanity i see this entire globalist movement as alien yes amen
[1:39:48.240 --> 1:39:52.320]  so the sequel really the spiritual sequel to new world order the book is the docu series i just
[1:39:52.320 --> 1:39:57.520]  put out called best kept secret and you're featured in it and it's a powerful docu series because it
[1:39:57.520 --> 1:40:04.240]  goes into the nature of how the elite the dark elite use franklin scandals sexual you know sexual
[1:40:04.880 --> 1:40:11.520]  pedophilia satanic invocations really traumatic to traumatize people to you know to basically
[1:40:11.520 --> 1:40:18.000]  high you know to to hide this this core of really i believe a satanic satanic heart that's really
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:22.000]  behind it i do believe there's a demonic force at work i do believe this is a multi-dimensional war
[1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:27.120]  a spiritual war there is something beyond this physical realm and this docu series gets into that
[1:40:27.120 --> 1:40:33.280]  step by step it's a powerful series how do people find it the best is on bimmy on demand but so
[1:40:33.280 --> 1:40:37.920]  sean stone dot info my website is the best place to link to it's also an iconic our friend david
[1:40:37.920 --> 1:40:44.720]  ike's uh streaming uh iconic dot com absolutely sean stone best kept secret find it at his site
[1:40:44.720 --> 1:40:50.000]  sean stone dot info continue laying out this group's aims and how do you think we fight back against it
[1:40:51.600 --> 1:40:54.480]  ultimately i mean it's the things that you know when you talked about that's why you're in the
[1:40:54.480 --> 1:40:59.200]  series i mean it very much is a spiritual war they want the transhuman thing because it's designed
[1:40:59.200 --> 1:41:04.400]  to disconnect us you see we as beings as physical beings in our bodies we are connected to god in
[1:41:04.400 --> 1:41:08.720]  our very being and our very breath and our every atom of our body is connected to the earth right
[1:41:08.720 --> 1:41:14.160]  which is god's universe the more that they can basically move us into this sort of digitized
[1:41:15.200 --> 1:41:20.560]  controllable controllable version synthetic version of humanity right and it began really
[1:41:20.560 --> 1:41:24.640]  and you'd say steiner and others saw it coming a hundred years ago with the synthetics the chemicals
[1:41:24.640 --> 1:41:28.480]  the chemical warfare the chemicals in our you know putting into our talk about fluoride and things
[1:41:28.480 --> 1:41:32.000]  like this put into our foods and our waters the monsanto's all these different companies they
[1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:37.840]  were born a hundred years ago uh don of the first world war and that sin that designed for synthetic
[1:41:37.840 --> 1:41:43.120]  life non-natural non-organic right the fact that you can go to a store and have to look for organic
[1:41:43.120 --> 1:41:47.600]  food is should tell you everything you need to know this is satanic it is against that which is
[1:41:47.600 --> 1:41:51.840]  natural which is made by god in the natural universe it's that they're creating a synthetic
[1:41:51.840 --> 1:41:56.240]  artificial metaverse really that's the way i see it an artificial reality where they control
[1:41:56.240 --> 1:42:02.880]  that outside of god's domain and you've been talking about this for decades shan stone and now
[1:42:02.880 --> 1:42:07.040]  here we are and again they hit us with so many different thousands of attacks and chemicals
[1:42:07.040 --> 1:42:11.760]  that you can't ever blame any one group when you add it all together you see the agenda total
[1:42:11.760 --> 1:42:18.080]  sterilization total death where to have a baby you've got to go have a chimera splice creation made
[1:42:18.080 --> 1:42:22.800]  that's not even really a human and then your checkmate the scientists now are god
[1:42:25.040 --> 1:42:28.240]  yeah i mean essentially i remember seeing a few years ago the chinese were developing artificial
[1:42:28.240 --> 1:42:34.080]  sperm do you remember that yes i do yeah i mean it's like what is that about what what is the
[1:42:34.080 --> 1:42:37.920]  intention here of the g it's really it's a lot of this is eugenics right i mean again talk about
[1:42:37.920 --> 1:42:43.440]  nazis why the nazis inherited in eugenics but guess where it really began it began in the
[1:42:43.440 --> 1:42:47.600]  anglo-american empires it was the british and the americans as you know that were hosting the first
[1:42:47.600 --> 1:42:52.000]  right let's talk about that with shan stone final segment ribbiting information we got to get him

[1:47:23.120 --> 1:47:28.320]  six to eight p.m. central it's picked up by a lot of our m&m stations and tv stations but we cut
[1:47:28.320 --> 1:47:34.640]  all the network ads out so there's only six minutes of ads an hour on that broadcast and
[1:47:34.640 --> 1:47:39.040]  i'm starting more and more podcasts that are commercial free as well those are very very
[1:47:39.040 --> 1:47:43.840]  popular so look for more of those in the next a few days and next few weeks with special guests
[1:47:43.840 --> 1:47:51.200]  and more in your phone calls shone stone the vaccine the biomedical tyranny how does that
[1:47:51.200 --> 1:48:00.480]  tie into your book the new world order right right oh where to begin um you know as i said earlier
[1:48:00.480 --> 1:48:05.680]  you're you saw the global response the global nature of this response to the to the to the
[1:48:05.680 --> 1:48:11.280]  covid pandemic let's call it right um knowing that there was gain of function research going on
[1:48:11.280 --> 1:48:16.160]  seeing now that madera and i had patented some sequences of it i've heard at the very beginning
[1:48:16.160 --> 1:48:21.520]  that there's hiv in the in the spike protein i guess or within you know within the covid-19
[1:48:22.560 --> 1:48:28.000]  virus so again you're talking about genetic really viruses are genetic warfare if you
[1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:32.000]  think about it because that's really what a virus is just it's genetic some people argue that
[1:48:32.000 --> 1:48:36.160]  viruses themselves are not really deadly it's the terrain it's you know it's how your body
[1:48:36.160 --> 1:48:40.240]  responds to it right but you're you're you're basically looking at why are these these gain
[1:48:40.240 --> 1:48:44.000]  of function research is going on in the first place why are they trying to create and we saw
[1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:48.640]  this back in 2001 right you know the creation of anthrax and how that was deployed right right after
[1:48:48.640 --> 1:48:54.400]  9 11 and we still don't have answers as to who created that anthrax and spread it but it seems
[1:48:54.400 --> 1:48:58.240]  to have been an inside job of some sort right there was never clear answers that always indicates
[1:48:58.240 --> 1:49:02.800]  that there was an inside job they had to cover it up the point is that so they're they're weaponizing
[1:49:03.760 --> 1:49:08.320]  you know these these viruses and you're you know again dealing with genetics and how they're trying
[1:49:08.320 --> 1:49:13.040]  to maybe target certain gene groups i mean we we gene pools i mean we saw we heard about this a
[1:49:13.040 --> 1:49:18.960]  long time ago with hiv as well you know was it was it designed to basically malevolently affect
[1:49:18.960 --> 1:49:24.160]  people of african descent more than more than you know let's say like white descent i mean it's very
[1:49:24.160 --> 1:49:28.240]  it was very interesting to hear these various conversations so when you look at the nature
[1:49:28.240 --> 1:49:32.640]  of the genetic we were talking earlier about the eugenics process right the eugenics programs which
[1:49:32.640 --> 1:49:38.560]  is very much racially based and trying to target certain groups trying to depopulate certain groups
[1:49:38.560 --> 1:49:43.840]  you have to always wonder you know with a covet 19 you know is was this designed white is that white
[1:49:43.840 --> 1:49:49.920]  affecting the native community the black and latino communities more let's say in america or well
[1:49:49.920 --> 1:49:56.400]  well exactly we know the spike protein plugs into receptors uh that people that have more equatorial
[1:49:56.400 --> 1:50:02.000]  bloodlines uh have larger receptor sites that's just a fact and and as you pointed out moderna
[1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:07.920]  now admits that they patented in 2016 that very spike protein that is genetically modified that
[1:50:07.920 --> 1:50:14.080]  is in the covet 19 virus proving it was man made and guess who holds the patent consortium with bill
[1:50:14.080 --> 1:50:19.440]  gates uh and of course uh fouchy and others involved and what do you make of melinda gates
[1:50:19.440 --> 1:50:24.720]  now melinda french coming out against her husband and saying he needs to answer that's a quote for
[1:50:25.440 --> 1:50:30.480]  epstein and that epstein was evil incarnate sounds like she knows some big shoes are about
[1:50:30.480 --> 1:50:36.400]  to drop shonestone well i take that with a grain of salt considering i can i i my my feeling my
[1:50:36.400 --> 1:50:42.320]  hunch is that she's a satanist herself so i think it's kind of like well whatever happened with this
[1:50:42.320 --> 1:50:47.200]  divorce uh does she feel like maybe you know is there something going on behind the scenes you
[1:50:47.200 --> 1:50:51.840]  know is bill basically is bill in trouble or is there is there another motivation herself but
[1:50:52.640 --> 1:50:56.880]  you don't buy that she's a good person but but but that is big news that she's distancing herself
[1:50:56.880 --> 1:51:01.760]  from him oh absolutely it's it's important it's certainly important and indicative and what she's
[1:51:01.760 --> 1:51:07.760]  saying about epstein you know look epstein was not just the pervert and involve a pedophilia he was a
[1:51:07.760 --> 1:51:12.880]  he was a very wealthy guy we don't really know how wealthy he was or you know if he was connected
[1:51:12.880 --> 1:51:18.640]  to massade cia british intelligence probably a collection of all three at some level um jillian
[1:51:18.640 --> 1:51:22.400]  max will obviously would indicate you know both massade and british intelligence but and epstein
[1:51:22.400 --> 1:51:27.280]  himself being jewish so it's like this is not surprising but the point is that epstein knows
[1:51:27.280 --> 1:51:33.120]  also as far as i know was interested in things like um uh getting blood from the you know the youth
[1:51:33.120 --> 1:51:37.280]  to preserve longevity we've seen about silicon valley right being very interested in the blood
[1:51:37.280 --> 1:51:42.800]  of the young he was also obsessed with human cloning he was obsessed with a corrupting scientist
[1:51:42.800 --> 1:51:49.280]  so they can control them yeah exactly exactly so his interests overlapped with very you know why
[1:51:49.280 --> 1:51:53.760]  why would i kept asking why would bill gates who's supposedly the richest guy in the world
[1:51:53.760 --> 1:51:59.120]  courting epstein for money give me a break that you know especially after he's convicted convicted
[1:51:59.120 --> 1:52:06.080]  as a pedophile right oh let me go ask this guy for money what who are you fooling man absolutely
[1:52:06.080 --> 1:52:09.680]  you know looking at some of these headlines the babelon b made the joke putin receives nobel
[1:52:09.680 --> 1:52:15.200]  prize in medicine for ending covid pandemic they've now the senate's passed the law to say okay
[1:52:16.320 --> 1:52:22.400]  the emergency's over but the house hasn't yet why do you think they're backing away from this now
[1:52:22.400 --> 1:52:27.760]  because of the backlash what do you think's happening yeah that's a really interesting question as to
[1:52:27.760 --> 1:52:32.560]  what is going on what are people waking up to deception obviously post you know we saw through
[1:52:32.560 --> 1:52:36.560]  this winter biden not only was biden completely inaccurate that it was going to be a winter of
[1:52:36.560 --> 1:52:41.680]  deaths for the unvaccinated but people that were vaccinated were all sick everyone got sick
[1:52:41.680 --> 1:52:45.120]  apparently right it was like back to the backs and everyone got sick it was a cold you know
[1:52:45.120 --> 1:52:48.880]  whether it was a bad cold or you know some people got you know the worst you know the
[1:52:48.880 --> 1:52:53.040]  longer version of covid i guess the point is that everyone got sick and so you can no longer
[1:52:53.040 --> 1:52:57.760]  simply say well the vaccines are working because you could see with your own eyes that it wasn't
[1:52:57.760 --> 1:53:01.920]  working and you could see with your own eyes people were dying and you just you know everyone was
[1:53:01.920 --> 1:53:06.160]  had someone they knew died from the vaccine so you could know i think at some point you could
[1:53:06.160 --> 1:53:10.240]  you realize that there was no longer a way of suppressing it plus the fiser documents being
[1:53:10.240 --> 1:53:17.440]  released as we saw chd's was saying that there's a 1291 side effects from the vaccine including
[1:53:17.440 --> 1:53:21.680]  death can you imagine a commercial where they say take the covid vaccine and they start listing the
[1:53:21.680 --> 1:53:26.560]  1291 side effects and by the way that was the first trunks of documents from just the first
[1:53:26.560 --> 1:53:31.360]  month and they report maybe one out of a hundred actually got in there absolutely right and and
[1:53:31.360 --> 1:53:36.000]  so they tried this they pushed it they're gonna try to do it again but it certainly blew up in
[1:53:36.000 --> 1:53:40.560]  their face you don't see fauci on tv anymore they've really got their tails between their
[1:53:40.560 --> 1:53:46.080]  legs and as you said more and more is coming out what do you expect him to do next i predicted war
[1:53:46.080 --> 1:53:51.840]  i predicted fake cyber attacks they blame on russia i predicted power outages and now they're
[1:53:51.840 --> 1:53:59.360]  telling us get ready for that i'm really concerned you know again we have to focus our energy and
[1:53:59.360 --> 1:54:03.920]  our intention in the awakening process i believe very much in communities i believe in states i
[1:54:03.920 --> 1:54:08.720]  moved to florida to get away from the the insane people because as far as i'm concerned you know
[1:54:08.720 --> 1:54:12.480]  california la places like this they proved themselves to me when they went to apartheid when
[1:54:12.480 --> 1:54:17.600]  they when they stood apartheid based on your vaccine status you showed your true colors to me
[1:54:17.600 --> 1:54:22.320]  and i don't want to be around people like that or or or politicians or you name it that's that's
[1:54:22.320 --> 1:54:26.080]  that's not the way i want to live my life i totally agree it's a total red line to say you
[1:54:26.080 --> 1:54:31.600]  got to have an app to buy and sell and leave your house folks that is a 10 on the rickshaw scale of
[1:54:31.600 --> 1:54:36.720]  martial law and tyranny i mean you did you accept that you're done i mean this is incredible
[1:54:37.680 --> 1:54:42.400]  exactly exactly so it's time for us to unite to find each other to maybe you know cities could
[1:54:42.400 --> 1:54:47.600]  be dangerous especially look the emf toxicity the overall pollution i mean cities are tough
[1:54:47.600 --> 1:54:52.160]  places in general to live i think people are being drawn to land being drawn you know to maybe
[1:54:52.160 --> 1:54:57.440]  conscious community to buying land getting you know growing crops eating organic finding a local
[1:54:57.440 --> 1:55:01.520]  farmer this is all makes you know this we've been talking about this myself and my friends and
[1:55:01.520 --> 1:55:06.240]  whatnot for a couple years now since actually before the the pandemic so i still believe this
[1:55:06.240 --> 1:55:10.400]  is the way forward is find your tribe find your community and it can be global but it's not
[1:55:10.400 --> 1:55:16.320]  within these toxic absolutely fascist every cell in my body was saying do this a few years ago now
[1:55:16.320 --> 1:55:22.800]  it's a demand move the country become self-sufficient every cell in my body is commanding me to do
[1:55:22.800 --> 1:55:27.440]  this it's obvious we've got to have an exodus now out of these big cities that are going to be death
[1:55:27.440 --> 1:55:31.920]  traps in closing what do you think is going to happen in these big cities why are our very cells
[1:55:31.920 --> 1:55:37.600]  telling us get the hell out yeah i mean it's already begun i mean we felt it with the 5g roll
[1:55:37.600 --> 1:55:41.440]  out you know my girlfriend is electro sensitive and she could feel the 5g whenever we were in a
[1:55:41.440 --> 1:55:46.000]  5g area she would literally feel it in her body so we had to flee that initially and then you know
[1:55:46.000 --> 1:55:51.280]  the pandemic started but you can feel the toxicity as far as i mentioned the pollution the access to
[1:55:51.280 --> 1:55:55.600]  clean water you know the lack of clean water the lack of access to farm you know to like fresh
[1:55:55.600 --> 1:56:02.240]  farmed goods it's just it's an overall visceral energetic feeling of low vibrational people that
[1:56:02.240 --> 1:56:06.400]  are not particularly informed not particularly interested in being informed you know they go from
[1:56:06.400 --> 1:56:10.240]  wearing a mask one day to you know put in the Ukrainian flag over their mouth the next and
[1:56:10.240 --> 1:56:15.280]  you said the key we all electromagnetically they probably pick up a six cents we all broadcast
[1:56:15.280 --> 1:56:20.480]  our own you know energy system and we it's toxic to be around these zombies it's sad
[1:56:20.480 --> 1:56:24.560]  that it's good people leave them it's going to make them get worse and we're going to get better
[1:56:24.560 --> 1:56:30.720]  but this is just the separation that has to happen unfortunately and the vaccine shedding is a true
[1:56:30.720 --> 1:56:36.160]  thing i mean we've seen it firsthand uh women women having blood clots in their period having
[1:56:36.160 --> 1:56:42.000]  multiple double triple periods in a month from being around as carriages yeah i mean i mean it's
[1:56:42.000 --> 1:56:47.440]  just it's ridiculous what's happened here and i think the MIT just put out a report study on it
[1:56:47.440 --> 1:56:53.600]  actually looking into the shedding it's part of their artificial intelligence that's all that right

[1:58:58.080 --> 1:59:05.440]  not anywhere is there a real study of the planet's ruling class and that's done by design the large
[1:59:05.440 --> 1:59:11.600]  central banks that basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics that look
[1:59:11.600 --> 1:59:16.080]  into say the anglo-american establishment the sound of the builder bird group the trilateral
[1:59:16.080 --> 1:59:21.680]  commission of the united nations the whole project of the rock calls and the rock folks until 10 years
