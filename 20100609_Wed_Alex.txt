[02:30.880 --> 02:34.840]  American citizen and nothing wrong with being Israeli it's just I have a problem
[02:34.840 --> 02:38.360]  with having a dual citizen who chose to serve in the Israeli military not our
[02:38.360 --> 02:44.200]  own military as the White House he was staffed and you better believe he's in

[08:07.960 --> 08:12.160]  be honest with you it's all posted up on info wars dot com and prison planet
[08:12.160 --> 08:17.600]  dot com but more and more I don't even cover one-tenth of the news I probably
[08:17.600 --> 08:23.280]  got 130 140 I was trying to count them earlier news articles here each one more
[08:23.280 --> 08:29.800]  insane than the next mainstream media is creating another hoax and they can get
[08:29.800 --> 08:33.360]  away with hoaxes they do it all the time they're saying it's illegal to film
[08:33.360 --> 08:37.960]  police and the media for the last few years has been saying this and so cops
[08:37.960 --> 08:43.200]  now all over the country they'll come up to somebody filming riot police at a
[08:43.200 --> 08:48.400]  public demonstration and arrest you saying it's wiretapping and they will
[08:48.400 --> 08:52.120]  bring it to a grand jury they will indict you they will tell the fluoride
[08:52.120 --> 08:58.680]  head thumb-sucking slave jury this and you will go to prison land of the free
[08:58.680 --> 09:03.280]  home of the brave you can't film God government but God government can
[09:03.280 --> 09:07.360]  license plate scan you face scan you thousands of cameras up in every city
[09:07.360 --> 09:10.040]  tracking everywhere you go government listening to you without warrants
[09:10.040 --> 09:15.320]  arresting citizens secretly torturing them the president can go on TV the
[09:15.320 --> 09:19.480]  former president say yes I still support torture I would do it all over again on
[09:19.480 --> 09:25.240]  television last week and then remember scores of people what more than 30 people
[09:25.240 --> 09:29.760]  went to prison for torturing in Afghanistan and Iraq for following the
[09:29.760 --> 09:34.360]  orders and one of them tried to use that in court from Afghanistan and they were
[09:34.360 --> 09:39.360]  charged with the Patriot Act to gag them from using the memos from the
[09:39.360 --> 09:43.760]  White House ordering them to torture so so that's freedom you're ordered to
[09:43.760 --> 09:47.760]  torture your torture and then you go to prison and the president comes out and
[09:47.760 --> 09:54.400]  says I like ordering torture and he doesn't get in trouble see how that's
[09:54.400 --> 10:00.480]  upside down that's like saying we arrested this mafia hit man for
[10:00.480 --> 10:05.320]  murdering someone he shot him four times when this local other mob boss walked
[10:05.320 --> 10:11.000]  out of his coffee shop was getting in his in his Mercedes and Don Julio or
[10:11.000 --> 10:17.200]  whatever his name you know gave the order but he's not in trouble and Don
[10:17.200 --> 10:23.400]  Julio admits that he gave the order for his hit man his mechanic to go kill
[10:23.400 --> 10:28.000]  this other guy but we're gonna throw the mechanic the hit man in prison but
[10:28.000 --> 10:31.440]  even though Don Julio admits he gave the order and paid for it he's not gonna
[10:31.440 --> 10:38.400]  get in trouble and Don Julio is gonna go on television Don Bush Don shrub Don
[10:38.400 --> 10:44.440]  W is gonna go on television and brag about it nothing's gonna happen by the
[10:44.440 --> 10:47.520]  way I happen to know the Supreme Court rulings I happen to know the state
[10:47.520 --> 10:50.640]  rulings that's how the government can film you without a warrant in a public
[10:50.640 --> 10:55.600]  place because there's no perception of privacy okay but these idiots that get
[10:55.600 --> 11:00.280]  charged end up plea bargaining the cops know full well and I've got the three
[11:00.280 --> 11:04.120]  states and I have the article here that's deceptive it says in three states
[11:04.120 --> 11:07.360]  it's illegal to film cops even in public they talks about a guy on a
[11:07.360 --> 11:10.520]  motorcycle who was all it's very popular motorcycle is to put a little
[11:10.520 --> 11:15.080]  mounted camera a big mounted camera on his helmet he was filming himself
[11:15.080 --> 11:21.080]  driving recklessly I wouldn't been against the cops arresting the guy you
[11:21.080 --> 11:24.720]  know if they think it was reckless but no they don't arrest him they give him a
[11:24.720 --> 11:29.200]  ticket and then they see it on YouTube later and now they've indicted him with
[11:29.200 --> 11:34.240]  a felony when the guy's already filming himself before the cop pulls him over the
[11:34.240 --> 11:38.680]  plane close cop jumps out has a gun makes himself look like a scared buffoon
[11:38.680 --> 11:44.600]  then the guy puts it on YouTube and they arrest him for it with a big camera
[11:44.600 --> 11:49.840]  mounted on his head that a two-year-old would know was a camera and they say
[11:49.840 --> 11:54.560]  it's wiretapping wiretapping laws are for someone coming up to say their
[11:54.560 --> 11:59.360]  x y's house and going to the phone box and putting alligator clips on a tape
[11:59.360 --> 12:02.320]  recorder that's when they pass these laws and listening to what goes on in
[12:02.320 --> 12:07.680]  your house you know it's illegal to go up to somebody's window on their property
[12:07.680 --> 12:12.000]  and stick a camera up to it and take photos of say a woman in her own bathtub
[12:12.000 --> 12:17.840]  that is a serious crime he's dropping wiretapping whatever you want to call it
[12:17.840 --> 12:21.840]  okay some states is a felony and it should be okay who wants perverts
[12:21.840 --> 12:27.000]  looking through your window but it is not against the law to videotape police
[12:27.000 --> 12:33.600]  now it is against the law to give if police or say got somebody spread eagle
[12:33.600 --> 12:36.320]  and they may have a weapon or drugs or something and you come over and get in
[12:36.320 --> 12:40.440]  their space and distract them you get up say within 20 feet and they say you're
[12:40.440 --> 12:44.560]  you're you're disrupting our operation get back then you could be arrested if
[12:44.560 --> 12:49.600]  you don't get back but to say I mean they've arrested the guy in Maryland who
[12:49.600 --> 12:57.480]  filmed cops gotta be 300 yards away beating an innocent person up for fun
[12:57.480 --> 13:03.680]  they're arresting people I've seen cases where the police come to somebody's door
[13:03.680 --> 13:08.080]  beat them up and the business owner has a surveillance system on their gas
[13:08.080 --> 13:13.320]  station and the people put it on YouTube and the cops arrest them I've seen
[13:13.320 --> 13:19.200]  cases where cops are caught stealing or beating somebody up or cheating on their
[13:19.200 --> 13:24.080]  wife and it ends up on YouTube and they arrest the people this is thuggish this
[13:24.080 --> 13:28.840]  is criminal and I'm calling the police agencies out to do this as filthy
[13:28.840 --> 13:34.520]  degenerate criminals you are tyrants and you disgrace your uniform and America
[13:34.520 --> 13:40.320]  it is disgusting oh yeah that that just happens to be one of the articles in my
[13:40.320 --> 13:47.200]  stack that when I read it they're just everywhere and the headline is get it
[13:47.200 --> 13:54.120]  here our cameras the new guns well yeah I have footage from three years ago it's
[13:54.120 --> 13:56.440]  in the film
[13:56.440 --> 14:02.600]  truth rising that I made totally action packed it's about activists on the
[14:02.600 --> 14:06.040]  streets and there and they've got a permit even when you go and lick the
[14:06.040 --> 14:09.080]  boots and get the permit in New York and got the little piece of paper I've
[14:09.080 --> 14:12.200]  been there when the cops tried to deny our little permit they turn our right
[14:12.200 --> 14:16.040]  into a privilege and they're like I don't think I'm gonna let you today are you
[14:16.040 --> 14:22.840]  talking back I'll take you to jail right now punk yeah well you you you you are
[14:22.840 --> 14:26.960]  here on this earth for one reason and that is to pay my paycheck slave you
[14:26.960 --> 14:34.040]  understand it's even worse than that the video we've got but and they walk over
[14:34.040 --> 14:41.520]  the two we are changers and they say turn your camera off or we're gonna say
[14:41.520 --> 14:46.320]  it's a gun and that your backpack's a bomb I knows it's not the gun I knows
[14:46.320 --> 14:51.320]  it's not the bomb but you gotta be 30 days in the hole and then the detectives
[14:51.320 --> 14:55.200]  and the security people call over plainclothes cops who then grab the
[14:55.200 --> 14:59.360]  camera and say this is a gun and then the cops didn't even erase the video they
[14:59.360 --> 15:02.440]  finally submitted and agreed to leave and have their first amendment violated
[15:02.440 --> 15:07.760]  and to submit to the tyranny and so the cops were so arrogant they let them
[15:07.760 --> 15:14.560]  leave with video of them threatening to frame them a serious felony and that's
[15:14.560 --> 15:18.800]  how criminal they are folks that's how you accustomed to committing crime in
[15:18.800 --> 15:26.520]  broad daylight on video they didn't even care in New York if a slave had video of
[15:26.520 --> 15:30.960]  them engaging and racketeering engaging in extortion violating someone's rights
[15:30.960 --> 15:36.280]  I mean it literal civil rights violations I mean police do you want
[15:36.280 --> 15:41.680]  your children living in a country where if people peacefully have a banner
[15:41.680 --> 15:45.280]  talking about the in controlled implosion of building seven standing in
[15:45.280 --> 15:48.480]  front of the new building seven that Larry Silverstein has his thugs come
[15:48.480 --> 15:54.280]  out retired New York police backed up by police and say on camera Larry doesn't
[15:54.280 --> 15:59.040]  like you here we're going to call in a bomb threat which by the way is a serious
[15:59.040 --> 16:07.720]  felony under the Patriot Act it's an act of terrorism I mean and then they are so
[16:07.720 --> 16:14.760]  evil that they don't even care we've got the footage that is the magnitude and
[16:14.760 --> 16:19.200]  now in the future we're not just going to say it's a gun and a bomb a listen
[16:19.200 --> 16:26.200]  Mac it's gonna be a eavesdropping on you never seen bugs bunny cartoons where he

[18:22.480 --> 18:26.600]  because we were having a 9-11 truth march they were having some type of police
[18:26.600 --> 18:32.040]  party with hundreds of police in uniform come around the corner drunk and

[23:18.960 --> 23:22.960]  said surgery and drugs was the only thing he could offer me what did crystal do
[23:22.960 --> 23:28.120]  I ordered heart and body extract in August 2006 when I first took my first
[23:28.120 --> 23:32.200]  15 drops I embraced the formula and could even feel the goodness of the

[23:58.920 --> 24:18.840]  extract. This is tyranny. I've got the New York Times here where they're
[24:18.840 --> 24:22.040]  harassing and trying to shut down homage everywhere saying they're bad for the
[24:22.040 --> 24:26.000]  environment. The environmental movement is about robbing you and making you a
[24:26.000 --> 24:29.800]  slave and making you dependent on government okay the environmental
[24:29.800 --> 24:33.560]  leaders could care less about the environment okay. In fact they're the
[24:33.560 --> 24:36.360]  transhumanist that had up all the genetic engineering and things that
[24:36.360 --> 24:40.640]  really do endanger this planet. It's all about making you feel guilty about
[24:40.640 --> 24:44.640]  yourself and hating yourself so they can take your property and the police in
[24:44.640 --> 24:50.640]  this country need to know the nation is now in a engineered collapse and you're
[24:50.640 --> 24:54.800]  going to be asked you've been hyped up and trained to go after the American
[24:54.800 --> 25:01.240]  people and engage in pure tyranny and you better decide today you better get
[25:01.240 --> 25:06.400]  down your knees and and and get right with God and ask yourself what side
[25:06.400 --> 25:11.720]  you're on. I know a lot of you are going to enjoy being thugs and you think
[25:11.720 --> 25:15.800]  you're on the winning team you're going to find out in the end that you sold
[25:15.800 --> 25:19.820]  yourself out but for those of you that aren't bad men and women you better
[25:19.820 --> 25:25.400]  grow up and recognize what you've been turned into. Now I know by and large a
[25:25.400 --> 25:28.280]  lot of police departments are good and a lot of most police are good. I've seen
[25:28.280 --> 25:32.880]  the statistics and the polls and I've seen the polls of 99% of cops being
[25:32.880 --> 25:39.000]  pro-gun but your leadership is almost completely scum. That's why they've got
[25:39.000 --> 25:43.280]  all these national movements to demonize and MSNBC pieces to demonize
[25:43.280 --> 25:49.040]  moves for good county sheriffs to be elected or for patriots to take over
[25:49.040 --> 25:53.120]  the legislatures. That's how America is supposed to work. The people run the
[25:53.120 --> 25:57.440]  government. We decide the type of police we want. We decide the laws. You
[25:57.440 --> 26:02.520]  understand that? Not offshore, new world order banks. I'm already digressing off
[26:02.520 --> 26:07.720]  into police. I just every couple days I read about them arresting somebody. There
[26:07.720 --> 26:14.640]  was one family I read about a month ago was just videotaping citizen spies that
[26:14.640 --> 26:18.680]  the police had spying on their neighbors so people videotaped them and got
[26:18.680 --> 26:24.080]  arrested. Another case people videotaped cops hiding on their own property with
[26:24.080 --> 26:28.080]  radar guns so they arrested them. I mean you know the government's going to
[26:28.080 --> 26:32.720]  videotape you but you're not going to videotape them. This is tyranny because
[26:32.720 --> 26:36.840]  video cameras are exposing police acting like out-of-control mad dog
[26:36.840 --> 26:40.880]  lunatics everywhere and so now they want to try to set a precedent to arrest
[26:40.880 --> 26:48.000]  everyone and they've now indicted and this person's facing life in prison in
[26:48.000 --> 26:53.040]  the army. I meant to get to that yesterday. In fact I will today. In fact here it is.
[26:53.040 --> 26:59.240]  Soldier arrested in WikiLeaks classified Iraq video case. Army spec Bradley
[26:59.240 --> 27:02.320]  Manning has been arrested in connection with the April release of classified
[27:02.320 --> 27:05.880]  footage of a US helicopter mistakenly shooting Iraqi civilians. You mean
[27:05.880 --> 27:10.880]  little girls and the US Army has arrested them and it's facing all sorts of
[27:10.880 --> 27:17.440]  charges. That's one thing but in the past they didn't arrest people that exposed
[27:17.440 --> 27:22.160]  crime. You better watch out ladies and gentlemen when people that exposed
[27:22.160 --> 27:27.680]  crimes are having the book thrown at them. They're arresting reporters now. The
[27:27.680 --> 27:34.960]  reporters that exposed that Bush was lying about WMDs arrested. Reporters that
[27:34.960 --> 27:40.000]  exposed 9-11 inside job arrested. Now they're announcing we want to shut down
[27:40.000 --> 27:43.760]  talk radio and free speech. Why does the average person out there driving along
[27:43.760 --> 27:46.880]  in their car going I don't care I'm not in the media. You know you're trained
[27:46.880 --> 27:50.960]  only care about yourself. I don't care if they shut down the media or arrest
[27:50.960 --> 27:54.280]  people. I just work at the factory. Yeah how long are you gonna have a factory
[27:54.280 --> 27:58.200]  job pal? What about when the government wants you to go serve two three months a
[27:58.200 --> 28:02.960]  year as slave labor under national service or wants to send you to another
[28:02.960 --> 28:06.200]  part of the country for a whole year for national service. You want to be
[28:06.200 --> 28:09.720]  busting rocks? Oh when you say no you're gonna be beat up and arrested as a
[28:09.720 --> 28:14.080]  terrorist and then taken to that gulag. This is all being announced. You're
[28:14.080 --> 28:17.960]  like really? Yes. They're announcing National Compulsory Service. It's in my
[28:17.960 --> 28:22.520]  film The Obama Deception. We've seen all this before. The government has
[28:22.520 --> 28:26.560]  announced it. It's gonna give you tyranny on a silver platter whether you like
[28:26.560 --> 28:30.040]  it or not. And if we everybody just goes along with this if you go along with
[28:30.040 --> 28:33.240]  naked body scanners. If you go along with them taking your baby's blood at birth
[28:33.240 --> 28:36.480]  and putting them in penning on databases. If you go along with them putting poison
[28:36.480 --> 28:41.240]  in your water to dumb you down and sterilize you. If you go along with all
[28:41.240 --> 28:46.880]  of the corruption. If you go along with them setting these precedents then
[28:46.880 --> 28:52.200]  they're gonna go all the way. As Thomas Jefferson told you every other country in
[28:52.200 --> 28:57.080]  world history falls to complete criminal tyranny. The sky is the limit. These
[28:57.080 --> 29:04.000]  people enjoy dominating and there isn't much time left. There isn't much time left
[29:04.000 --> 29:09.880]  to screw around. Okay they are moving with classical hardcore tyranny with a
[29:09.880 --> 29:15.040]  high-tech integration right now and admitting it. Yeah we record your
[29:15.040 --> 29:18.640]  naked children and your wife and you and yeah we're saving it. What you gonna do
[29:18.640 --> 29:21.040]  about it? Yeah we're gonna take your blood at checkpoints without warrants.
[29:21.040 --> 29:24.600]  What you gonna do about it? Yeah we're setting up tyranny. What you gonna do
[29:24.600 --> 29:27.520]  about it? Well I'll tell you what I'm gonna do about it. I'm gonna rally the
[29:27.520 --> 29:31.480]  American people to attempt to peacefully legislatively take our government
[29:31.480 --> 29:34.560]  back. And then we're gonna have a big enough number of people that are awake
[29:34.560 --> 29:38.520]  when you try your violence against us it's not gonna work. You understand that?
[29:38.520 --> 29:41.880]  So that's what's coming up ladies and gentlemen. I'm gonna blitz through news on
[29:41.880 --> 29:49.840]  the economy on bin Laden supposedly. You know in Iran now it is all coming up.
[29:49.840 --> 29:55.080]  You'll want to stay with us. We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones
[29:55.080 --> 30:02.080]  and the GCN radio network. This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[30:02.080 --> 30:06.520]  consider buying a solar power generator. Number one new climate legislation could
[30:06.520 --> 30:10.560]  easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two our new energies are
[30:10.560 --> 30:13.960]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[30:13.960 --> 30:18.480]  It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[30:18.480 --> 30:22.880]  technology is coming. Number three in some areas of the country the power grid
[30:22.880 --> 30:27.080]  is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[30:27.080 --> 30:30.840]  compounding the problem. Number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[30:30.840 --> 30:34.480]  local grids. Every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[30:34.480 --> 30:38.800]  related onages. Number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[30:38.800 --> 30:41.960]  insurance and peace of mind. Folks I really believe in the solar power
[30:41.960 --> 30:45.640]  generators offered by Solutions from Science. One of my oldest sponsors. You

[31:58.800 --> 32:04.200]  They helped to create a new world order. We are part of a new world order. A new
[32:04.200 --> 32:09.600]  world order based upon collective action. Invisible Empire is a damning indictment
[32:09.600 --> 32:13.480]  of the globalist through their own words and documents. The new world order really
[32:13.480 --> 32:17.800]  is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities. It means all the world
[32:17.800 --> 32:22.840]  under their control. The United Nations would take over America the Tri-Lateral

[34:12.240 --> 34:18.040]  bin Laden and top aides are hiding in Iran and you know I've been hearing this
[34:18.040 --> 34:21.680]  for the last month and this is put out by the debco file a well-known Israeli
[34:21.680 --> 34:26.400]  front and they might as well say that Marvin the Martian is hanging out in
[34:26.400 --> 34:30.600]  Iran I mean they might as well Israel is hell bent on starting World War three
[34:30.600 --> 34:35.200]  and so are the Iranians saying they're gonna send an armed escort with the
[34:35.200 --> 34:39.000]  flotilla in the Mediterranean that isn't even in their sphere of influence or
[34:39.000 --> 34:44.880]  their region now they're on the borders of Asia not Europe I mean what is Iran
[34:44.880 --> 34:52.200]  looking for what is Israel looking for both sides discussed to me it is
[34:52.200 --> 34:59.840]  unbelievable this is going on and remember what the Washington Post reported
[34:59.840 --> 35:08.560]  just two weeks ago in spy talk remember the headline CIA units wacky idea to pick
[35:08.560 --> 35:13.840]  Saddam as gay but buried within the article and we have excised pieces of
[35:13.840 --> 35:19.280]  that in our article former CIA officials admit to faking bin Laden video that
[35:19.280 --> 35:23.240]  news for you they're all fakes even the real ones are admittedly recuts of
[35:23.240 --> 35:28.480]  stuff from 99 2000 2001 they just recut it I mean of course they do I first
[35:28.480 --> 35:31.920]  pointed that out before it was admitted you could see it was old videos do the
[35:31.920 --> 35:39.520]  same video but they think you're stupid I think you're not paying attention and
[35:39.520 --> 35:43.160]  it goes on the agency actually did make a video reporting to show Osama bin Laden
[35:43.160 --> 35:47.200]  and his cronies sitting around a campfire swinging bottles of liquor and
[35:47.200 --> 35:51.280]  savoring their conquest with boys one of the former CIA officers recalled
[35:51.280 --> 35:57.040]  chuckling at the memory the actors were drawn from some of us some of our darker
[35:57.040 --> 36:02.840]  skinned employees he said yeah they were probably actually having fun with
[36:02.840 --> 36:08.320]  that's kind of a CIA thing I guess that's what Washington's all about I guess
[36:08.320 --> 36:11.320]  they've had too many women they're bored with it but they say that's the way
[36:11.320 --> 36:16.240]  that goes CIA units wacky idea depicting Saddam as gay and then down in the
[36:16.240 --> 36:21.440]  article they just admit oh yeah oh yeah we fake videos well of course they do
[36:21.440 --> 36:28.480]  and now they don't even fake videos they just say oh hey the Israelis say that
[36:28.480 --> 36:35.440]  the Sunni arch enemy of the Shiites is hanging out in Iran
[36:37.760 --> 36:42.840]  absolutely asinine then meanwhile for four years the White House admitted
[36:42.840 --> 36:46.440]  under Bush and now Obama that four different terrorist groups three of them
[36:46.440 --> 36:51.160]  al-Qaeda real Wahhabist al-Qaeda out of Saudi Arabia are inside Iran carrying
[36:51.160 --> 36:56.720]  out targeted bombings and our government admits their bombing Iran and Iran
[36:56.720 --> 37:01.320]  sits there and takes it that's a smart move unless they want nukes raining down
[37:01.320 --> 37:06.080]  it's meant to be a provocation and now Ahmed Denizad says I'm gonna send ships
[37:06.080 --> 37:12.720]  you're letting the CIA bomb you wisely not responding unless you want to be
[37:12.720 --> 37:17.400]  totally blown to bits which is what the globalist want but then you're gonna
[37:17.400 --> 37:23.160]  send ships with a flotilla I hope that's just rhetoric oh some have been
[37:23.160 --> 37:28.760]  lauding in top aides are hiding in Iran oh some have been lauding hiding place

[40:33.800 --> 40:39.200]  cowards home of the slaves well actually you're not you're waking up you're
[40:39.200 --> 40:42.440]  getting angry every incumbents being thrown out of office the system is
[40:42.440 --> 40:45.640]  panicking and I'm telling you they're getting ready to stage false flag attacks
[40:45.640 --> 40:50.320]  in fact I heard them last night on the radio reading the quotes of the judge
[40:50.320 --> 40:54.080]  when she ordered the last Atari person released you guys print me the latest on
[40:54.080 --> 41:00.160]  the Atari militia and it was quotes to paraphrase you know the feds have
[41:00.160 --> 41:04.760]  involved in fraud no one was you know this is a fantasy no one was a planning
[41:04.760 --> 41:09.440]  to attack the police you know this is a dangerous precedent I'm ordering them
[41:09.440 --> 41:14.760]  released this is all a hoax those were the type of quotes coming out of the
[41:14.760 --> 41:21.280]  judge it was a total hoax and who told you in August of last year eight months
[41:21.280 --> 41:26.560]  before Atari got arrested that they were going to target Atari I did I could
[41:26.560 --> 41:31.320]  take one look at those Atari videos and tell you ladies and gentlemen that
[41:31.320 --> 41:36.800]  comes directly out of government central casting directly I mean you can
[41:36.800 --> 41:41.440]  tell a movie I mean it wasn't hard the day I saw the fat bin Laden with a new
[41:41.440 --> 41:45.840]  nose and he suddenly gained 150 pounds that that wasn't bin Laden and they had
[41:45.840 --> 41:52.200]  the camera blurred on purpose thinking you were stupid that's the footage with
[41:52.200 --> 41:57.520]  the supposed young boys around me and then linguists listen to it and said
[41:57.520 --> 42:00.600]  it's not even a Saudi Arabian dialect then they did a voice print of it and
[42:00.600 --> 42:04.640]  it wasn't him wasn't him now they laugh and admit it wasn't him of course it
[42:04.640 --> 42:10.800]  wasn't him I don't need a linguist I don't need a voice print I can look at a
[42:10.800 --> 42:14.640]  video and tell you if it's fake let me tell you something that underwear bombing
[42:14.640 --> 42:18.000]  video they showed were for one second he turns his face and the guys were in a
[42:18.000 --> 42:21.920]  hood you see the dark shadow around the face like it's Obi-Wan Kenobi like it's
[42:21.920 --> 42:26.160]  a specter you could see that face super imposed over it these guys aren't even
[42:26.160 --> 42:32.680]  good at faking video this is like a 1980s video the videos like a shimmering
[42:32.680 --> 42:36.720]  specter it looks like Obi-Wan Kenobi whenever Luke Skywalker's reaching up
[42:36.720 --> 42:41.560]  after he's escaped the the the snow beast and he sees Obi-Wan Kenobi there as a
[42:41.560 --> 42:46.600]  phantom I mean it literally is like a phantom hologram they don't even make
[42:46.600 --> 42:51.960]  good fakes their fake videos aren't good the Intel Center is so lazy openly
[42:51.960 --> 42:55.880]  run by former heads of CIA propaganda black ops publicly they don't even have
[42:55.880 --> 42:59.560]  you know somebody in there doesn't have a history of intelligence ops and they
[42:59.560 --> 43:06.400]  put the alkyda logo in the same video layer as the Intel Center logo any
[43:06.400 --> 43:11.040]  moron could blow it up on the screen and see it was in the same pixel layer
[43:11.040 --> 43:25.360]  I mean this is ridiculous and it goes on and on and on you see they know you want
[43:25.360 --> 43:28.520]  to believe the lie you want to believe there's a brown-skinned guy with a big
[43:28.520 --> 43:33.280]  turban who's gonna get you they know at a red-blooded level you want to kill
[43:33.280 --> 43:37.680]  somebody who's foreign you know it's tribal okay whatever the point is they
[43:37.680 --> 43:42.120]  dangle this literal Hollywood production in front of you and now they're
[43:42.120 --> 43:48.200]  telling you that he is in Iran and he is going to get you while in the real
[43:48.200 --> 43:52.680]  world the White House is so arrogant it puts out press releases bragging and
[43:52.680 --> 43:56.560]  listing the terror groups that are attacking Iran and all of them are real
[43:56.560 --> 44:05.640]  alkyda because real alkyda is CIA to Al CIA to and and that's just the facts I
[44:05.640 --> 44:09.160]  mean I had Ray McGovern on three four years ago when they blew up the Golden
[44:09.160 --> 44:13.960]  Mosque and he said his intel sources a high-level former CIA said that for they
[44:13.960 --> 44:18.280]  shut the Moss down for four hours wired the whole thing was C4 and blew the
[44:18.280 --> 44:21.800]  Golden Dome off of it one of the most holy sites in Iraq to get the Shiites
[44:21.800 --> 44:26.840]  and Sunnis killing each other and they went out and said you know that oh the
[44:26.840 --> 44:31.200]  Shiites did this massacre and the Sunnis did this one to get a literal war going
[44:31.200 --> 44:34.800]  as a pretext to keep our troops there and then as soon as they wanted to stop
[44:34.800 --> 44:39.440]  that they stopped blowing up Mosque and all the locals saw US forces and later
[44:39.440 --> 44:44.600]  came out mainstream news but back of the paper saw US forces go in clear the
[44:44.600 --> 44:49.440]  Mosque wire it pull out and blow it up in front of everyone they think you're so
[44:49.440 --> 44:53.840]  dumb they blow Mosque up in front of everyone to get the Muslims murdering
[44:53.840 --> 44:59.040]  each other and remember the London Guardian it was confirmed Basra Iraqi
[44:59.040 --> 45:04.920]  police put in by the British caught British SAS special forces assigned to MI
[45:04.920 --> 45:08.880]  6 dressed up running around shooting and bombing dressed up with fake beards
[45:08.880 --> 45:15.720]  dressed up as Sunnis attacking Shiite areas of Basra it was total and they
[45:15.720 --> 45:20.440]  arrested them they were able to get them and they took them and then what did the
[45:20.440 --> 45:25.280]  British do they openly assaulted the Iraqi police station and freed them but
[45:25.280 --> 45:29.680]  not before photos got out of them with their beards off totally fake it's all
[45:29.680 --> 45:35.600]  fake it's all fake ladies and gentlemen fake fake fake fake fake why do you
[45:35.600 --> 45:39.840]  think there's so many IEDs killing our troops over there why are they telling
[45:39.840 --> 45:43.440]  our police that we're about to have IED attacks all over America because that's
[45:43.440 --> 45:48.280]  something that black ops and private corporations and Merck groups can go do
[45:48.280 --> 45:52.960]  IEDs in Iraq and Afghanistan and the United States to make the troops have
[45:52.960 --> 45:58.920]  time around and hate the enemy which is imaginary you understand that you
[45:58.920 --> 46:03.640]  understand that see they know during the blitz that people to get bombed get
[46:03.640 --> 46:09.480]  more angry and so if there's not really any real enemies attacking you've got
[46:09.480 --> 46:13.400]  to go out and plant IEDs to kill our own troops how many times they caught
[46:13.400 --> 46:16.920]  firefighters planting pipe bombs in the US are burning down buildings for
[46:16.920 --> 46:21.880]  attention well this is a lot worse than that large portions of the bombings and
[46:21.880 --> 46:25.320]  shootings were carried out by private Merck's the Merck's many of them are
[46:25.320 --> 46:30.040]  there to kill our own troops and to set up roadside bombs you understand that
[46:30.040 --> 46:34.200]  you understand that because if you're gonna have a war in the Middle East and
[46:34.200 --> 46:37.800]  Central Asia where private firms are making half a trillion dollars a year
[46:37.800 --> 46:42.640]  off the books not to mention the drug money they've got to have a reason to
[46:42.640 --> 46:48.440]  be there they've got to have some some body counts the truth is body counts in
[46:48.440 --> 46:51.880]  many cases actually raise morale and make people want to fight and kill and go
[46:51.880 --> 46:56.440]  back you understand and then there is some real insurgents there are some
[46:56.440 --> 46:59.760]  real groups fighting but mainly its sectarian every time that got stirred
[46:59.760 --> 47:04.600]  up between Sunni and Shi'ite every time the globalist blew up a new mosque or
[47:04.600 --> 47:08.000]  killed a new religious leader then our troops got stuck in the middle of it
[47:08.000 --> 47:12.920]  then as I told you years before it happened they flipped the switch and
[47:12.920 --> 47:18.280]  turned off a lot of the sectarian violence it's all rigged and they say oh
[47:18.280 --> 47:21.840]  look we've got less fighting now well of course you got less fighting you don't
[47:21.840 --> 47:26.960]  have British US and Israeli and other private contractors in fact they've
[47:26.960 --> 47:34.120]  caught Afghans shipped in on C-130s to Iraq that's come out mainstream news you
[47:34.120 --> 47:40.240]  understand folks that this is all staged this is all staged staged staged
[47:40.240 --> 47:44.680]  staged staged staged and they try to take our power away from us I expose
[47:44.680 --> 47:48.800]  its fake videos I expose its fake video layers we expose all their fraud so they
[47:48.800 --> 47:51.840]  just we expose their ship and opium out of the country they just come and say
[47:51.840 --> 47:56.520]  yeah we're doing it big deal let's move on come on and they know the average
[47:56.520 --> 48:01.960]  good old boy who's a well-meaning person just wants to hate foreigners and feel
[48:01.960 --> 48:06.000]  like America still America you know I may not have my pension fund the bankers
[48:06.000 --> 48:10.320]  may be ripping me off but at least we're killing Hodges least I can go watch a
[48:10.320 --> 48:16.680]  great movie like the Hurt Locker by the Hurt Locker was shot much of it in Iraq
[48:16.680 --> 48:22.280]  it was embedded that thing is a psyop you know at the end of the movie the
[48:22.280 --> 48:26.720]  ultimate hero the coolest guy signs back up for his fourth tour of bomb
[48:26.720 --> 48:31.600]  disposal and he's a wild man he's a hero he's a John Wayne you know he's never
[48:31.600 --> 48:35.960]  gonna stop it's so exciting when those helicopters land at the end and he goes
[48:35.960 --> 48:40.600]  walking off you know to serve his fifth tour he tells his son I don't even love
[48:40.600 --> 48:46.160]  you his wife I don't even care about you and it's a beautiful thing he says you
[48:46.160 --> 48:52.000]  know as you get older you only love a few things and now I don't even love two
[48:52.000 --> 48:55.880]  things I only love one thing and he basically tells his son he's like a
[48:55.880 --> 48:59.920]  worthless jack-in-the-box and leaves him to go back to war for adrenaline and
[48:59.920 --> 49:04.720]  he's the hero that's a good thing it's like they teach you torture is good
[49:04.720 --> 49:09.200]  just like they teach you all this is good no there isn't those guys that have
[49:09.200 --> 49:14.920]  served two three four five tours want to go back because they're screwed up because
[49:14.920 --> 49:19.600]  it is boring to go to the supermarket and buy cereal it is boring that's why
[49:19.600 --> 49:23.200]  most of them want to come back and be cops but instead of fighting Hodges as
[49:23.200 --> 49:26.560]  they call them they're pulling your wife over they're pulling your 17 year old
[49:26.560 --> 49:30.480]  kid over and your 17 year old kids driving back from the gym and he's got
[49:30.480 --> 49:34.040]  his weight belt in the front seat of his car so the cop who's just been back at
[49:34.040 --> 49:38.360]  four tours pulls his gun and blows your son's head off and then plants a gun on
[49:38.360 --> 49:42.560]  you because he had no business being a cop because he's a screwed up fruit loop
[49:42.560 --> 49:47.680]  from four or five tours in hardcore combat and all of the basic army
[49:47.680 --> 49:52.240]  psychologists knew by World War two that you don't put somebody in more than one
[49:52.240 --> 49:57.880]  tour because there's no coming back for them they're completely fried they need
[49:57.880 --> 50:05.280]  instant threat every day they need war they need death they need carnage this

[50:38.160 --> 50:43.560]  war is over who can wage war on you and that's why they've got these IED guys in

[50:46.800 --> 50:50.440]  feds are gonna bomb the local police and tell them that the local gun owners did

[56:05.440 --> 56:08.640]  need a new war what have we been telling you for years when they orchestrated
[56:08.640 --> 56:12.400]  the financial derivatives meltdown they would try to start world war three with
[56:12.400 --> 56:16.880]  Iran but the rand corporation said that wasn't enough two years ago we have an
[56:16.880 --> 56:21.400]  article at prison planet calm they said we need a multi-level multi-region war
[56:21.400 --> 56:29.640]  bigger than the last two Iraq invasions similar to world war two and what's

[56:51.880 --> 56:56.080]  course I'm in it many others are in it and then we've got Gerald Solente coming
[56:56.080 --> 56:59.160]  on but I've got other news here on the economy we're gonna be covering with
[56:59.160 --> 57:04.200]  them when they're on with us but here's another headline info wars.com
[57:04.200 --> 57:07.600]  receives rise of the right script for those that are interested about the
[57:07.600 --> 57:12.320]  Chris Matthews hit piece airing next Wednesday and yes I am the chief enemy
[57:12.320 --> 57:16.880]  and target along with Rand Paul someone inside MSNBC who's concerned about the
[57:16.880 --> 57:21.240]  production and who does believe it's a hit piece who will remain anonymous has
[57:21.240 --> 57:26.800]  sent us the script so this boffin has sent us the Death Star plans and we do
[57:26.800 --> 57:32.640]  have it and Paul Watson is writing a detailed article but it's exactly what
[57:32.640 --> 57:37.160]  I predicted they lied to me of course they lied and I said I know you're lying
[57:37.160 --> 57:40.000]  they called they said oh it's a friendly piece to understand the Tea Party we
[57:40.000 --> 57:44.000]  want to be friends with you and I said no you're gonna show me next to Father
[57:44.000 --> 57:48.920]  Coughlin the Nazi from the 40s and you're going to show malicious shooting
[57:48.920 --> 57:52.640]  machine guns and they said no no no we're doing something different I said no
[57:52.640 --> 57:57.520]  you're not and I have the script it is exactly of course the just standard
[57:57.520 --> 58:03.560]  Southern Prairie Law Center ADL but even more anyone who owns a gun is a Nazi
[58:03.560 --> 58:08.960]  and is basically Hitler they say this is Nazi Germany and that Nazi Germany is
[58:08.960 --> 58:13.400]  about to happen and that Hitler thought bankers were robbing people no one's
[58:13.400 --> 58:17.400]  talking about Hitler no one's discussing Hitler the banks are robbing
[58:17.400 --> 58:23.400]  people and in MSNBC makes it all about Jews we don't talk about Jews we're not
[58:23.400 --> 58:27.920]  injecting Jews here but Chris Matthews does exactly what I knew they would do
[58:27.920 --> 58:35.720]  exactly precisely because we know these people they are pathetic but we have the

[01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:57.080]  court has ruled that Arizona Supreme Court Texas courts ruled the same thing
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:01:00.280]  and the police just say we don't care we're still gonna do it it's a federal
[01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:07.680]  grant we don't listen to a stinking state court we hail Caesar exactly what
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:17.400]  happened in Rome 2040 plus years ago they have hailed Caesar who's crossed the
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:22.520]  Rubicon the federal government is Caesar they they have federal programs
[01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:25.920]  teaching 50 plus thousand preachers how to covertly brainwash their flocks to
[01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:29.480]  render it under Caesar and submit to the government how is that a free society
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:34.000]  how our TV ads all over the country to spy on your neighbor how was that land
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.560]  of the free home of the brave the answer is it in the government can't stop the
[01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:44.960]  oil spill but they can sure train the cops to hate the American people good
[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:52.560]  news there's a lot of police are waking up of course it turns out the whole
[01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:56.120]  Atari militia thing is fake and the judge says it's a cover-up and a fraud
[01:01:56.120 --> 01:02:00.720]  that we're gonna be going over that I also mentioned info wars.com's
[01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:04.400]  received the rise of the right MSNBC hit piece I don't get why we're
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:08.120]  obsessing over this so much though I mean MSNBC their average show has about
[01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:12.720]  100,000 viewers their top shows half a million this this radio show has more
[01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:16.520]  viewers and listeners than they do they're pathetic they're pathetic but
[01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:21.840]  it's all slick and glossy and they're still that that that racial memory of
[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:27.960]  of TV being a big deal it's a joke yeah Glenn Beck's got three million viewers
[01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:32.960]  that's pretty big but I mean somebody like Rush Limbaugh has over 10 million a
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:37.160]  day that tune in 22 million a week George Norrie's got about seven million
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:42.480]  tune in a day 16 million a week or more that's that's that's every week not
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:47.160]  people that listen later in the internet retransmissions or it's got to be well
[01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:51.680]  over 20 million for George Norrie this show conservatively 2 million on AM and
[01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:57.800]  FM a million on the internet let's see we don't have you know maybe I should put
[01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:03.800]  it a big fancy set and wear a thousand dollar $2,000 suit and an act all pompous
[01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:12.640]  like Chris Matthews it's all I hoax but he is trying to demonize the tea party
[01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:15.720]  they've already tried to demonize Ron Paul and Rand Paul and Michelle Bachman
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:20.120]  all his other people and so now they're gonna try to use me to demonize the tea
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:23.520]  party and that's not gonna work oh look he's radical he says radical things oh
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:28.280]  scary and then I'll just get more viewers more listeners and because they're
[01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:34.720]  discredited no one the vast majority of people even watching MSNBC do not trust
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:39.640]  or like slimeball Matthews I mean would you buy a used car from Chris Matthews
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:44.520]  would you let your daughter date Chris Matthews he comes off like a fruit box
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:56.240]  I love that term a self-conceited arrogant dumb cloistered foolish twit like
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:04:04.040]  fruit box and so I'm not worried about their hit piece but by the way I knew
[01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:06.920]  exactly what your piece would be and their producers know I told them what
[01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:11.800]  it would be and this is like every other piece it's like every other thing you do
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:17.760]  oh look at the Nazis now we're gonna cut to Rand Paul and Alex Jones oh look at
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:21.880]  the mom who has her 10 year olds and 5 year olds involved in the tea party now
[01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:25.720]  let's cut to a militia guy isn't he scary he's got a gun no people see that
[01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:29.200]  militia guy and say thank God somebody's got guns to counterbalance this
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:36.000]  degenerate out of control criminal government those militias are looking a

[01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:54.520]  why don't you I know you don't like to brag about yourself but and Mr. Patula
[01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:59.320]  you know some of the big movies you guys have been involved producing and why
[01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:04.000]  you decided to make a documentary. Well Alex we're our other partner who's not
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.960]  here is Robert DeNazi who you met as well and he produced the film Flight
[01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:12.000]  Plan with Jody Foster that was out in the theaters. Jimmy's produced a movie
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:17.280]  called Reversal which was a father and son wrestling story and I produced a
[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:22.680]  bunch of documentaries. Actually Alex this this film was actually an accident
[01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:27.160]  when we set out to do this three years ago with our own money totally
[01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:31.640]  independently financed we were just going to make a movie about what it would
[01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:38.960]  be like to live in America in a post 9-11 world sort of an 80-minute thing so
[01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:42.680]  what we did was we started traveling the country and we met a bunch of notable
[01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:48.840]  economists writers journalists filmmakers politicians bureaucrats and we
[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:52.520]  started interviewing them we started talking to them about what it would be
[01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:58.320]  like to live in a post 9-11 America and one word kept coming up and one phrase
[01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:01.720]  kept coming up over and over again in our transcripts as we're interviewing
[01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:06.920]  people the word collapse and I would hear things like from eminent people Dr.
[01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:11.000]  Paul Craig Roberts the father of Reaganomics Doug Casey an eminent
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:17.080]  economist you realize America's falling Brian we're already in the like in
[01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:21.400]  mathematically with fractional reserve banking it's designed to do this right
[01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:24.480]  and it's like a heroin addict you know you're gonna end up dying from it if you
[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:29.680]  stay on it right and we're now to the point of you know in a coma exactly and
[01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:33.720]  I kept up but I was surprised so the film became the film about the collapse the
[01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:37.880]  fall of Western civilization because that's what you got you were trying to
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:40.840]  make another film but all these eminent people were telling you know this is
[01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:43.840]  what's going on correct we were trying to make an 80-minute film and it's her we
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:47.280]  looked at each other halfway through this and said guys we have a 10 hour
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:55.480]  series home study course survival guide in video form DVD form about the fall of
[01:11:55.480 --> 01:12:00.520]  America which is not coming this is what was made clear to me by these eminent
[01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:06.280]  people it's not coming tomorrow next year or two years we're in it now and one
[01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:11.000]  of the the the eminent guests that I that I was talking to Doug Casey said you
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:15.440]  know in 1929 in the Great Depression people thought it was over they thought
[01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:21.120]  it was over that's where we are in 2010 today inning two he said of a nine inning
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:25.720]  catastrophe to use a baseball analogy so if we're in inning two I said well
[01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:29.680]  what's inning three four five six seven eight nine gonna look like and he said
[01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:34.560]  the quality of life in America is going to decrease significantly and I said
[01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:37.080]  well what does that mean by the way when you were shooting us a year and a half
[01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:40.520]  ago and I'm sorry interrupt sir this wasn't really on the news now we have
[01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:44.680]  the head of the World Bank the head of the IMF telling us you know it's over
[01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:48.440]  headline Washington Post the good times are over but they're telling us this is
[01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:52.400]  a good thing this is what we deserve while the bankers get record bonuses
[01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:56.640]  right when so he responded go ahead well when Alan Greenspan who recently said
[01:12:56.640 --> 01:13:02.720]  that this is a credit tsunami when Comptroller David Walker says it's
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:08.360]  25 times bigger than what we thought meaning the recession in 08 when Paul
[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:12.920]  Volcker says hold on to your hats this is really these are the bureaucrats in
[01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:17.120]  part that started this right as part of the Keens but now they're gonna be our
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:22.880]  saviors right so when they're saying that when Alan Greenspan is agreeing with
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:27.920]  Alex Jones we've got a problem when Alan Greenspan is agreeing with Doug Casey
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:32.360]  and Dr. Paul Craig Roberts and David Ike it's time for the people to listen and
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:38.120]  so the point of this film really is to help people protect themselves that's
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:41.920]  why I'm here and I want to go around the country and talk to schools and
[01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:48.080]  churches and rabbis and people in power or who have you know who have access to
[01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:54.800]  the community to tell people guys we're not in recovery this is not we're not in
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:14:01.000]  a good place right now we're entering into the greater greater depression and
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:04.400]  that's and that's why I'm here well I just look at the headlines today here's
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:09.640]  one risk to global economy have risen significantly top IMF official warns
[01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:14.040]  here is another one Wall Street Journal gold hits records central banks in
[01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:21.960]  focus here's another one the Phantom Recovery another you know headline here
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:26.040]  of the Wall Street Journal investment banker it's going to get nasty by land
[01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:30.240]  barbed wire and guns and then here's the Wall Street Journal that was MSNBC
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:35.600]  tax hikes and the 2012 economic collapse look they knew this was going to happen
[01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:39.240]  because they designed it I mean we were saying this 10 years ago we knew
[01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:43.200]  derivatives were thousands of times all the real money in the world and we're
[01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:46.720]  building towards that you know towards being hundreds of thousands of times
[01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:51.680]  potentially and that if we don't say no to the people that got rid of the glass
[01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:54.800]  teagle act in 99 that's when we really knew this was going to happen it was a
[01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:59.360]  it was a surety I had many economists on a 99 2000 that said in the next decade
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:03.400]  this will happen and so now we're here and the very crooks that engineered this
[01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:07.040]  are now posing as our saviors if we don't expose them they're going to get
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:10.320]  away with the next phase and this is going to be a hundred inning depression
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:15.400]  because it's designed to be where they bankrupt us by design to make us be
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:19.720]  controlled by their system and that's why the film the fall of America is so
[01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:24.640]  important you need to go to the fall of America dot net folks and get this film
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:29.840]  and show it to everyone you know show it at your church you know you know over
[01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:34.200]  four or five weeks show it you know at the local library whatever so people
[01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:38.760]  understand what's happening and I want to say one thing Alex absolutely it's
[01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:44.360]  about exposing them but also it's about protecting ourselves while we expose
[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:48.400]  them the analogy another analogy I like is the ship is sinking but none of us
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:52.440]  have prepared our lifeboats if you've prepared your lifeboats good for you but
[01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:57.960]  there's literally 150 things in this 10-part series that people need to do
[01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:03.600]  now so that when this happens the greater depression we are okay because we
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:06.600]  need almost so let's it calls it the greatest depression the greatest
[01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:10.120]  depression you've got to do things it's not just financial things but that's a
[01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:14.160]  big part of this it's not just gold and silver but that's a big part of it it's
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:17.840]  a lot of other things is getting to know your neighbors it's everything listen I
[01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:22.400]  was out in Wimberley a month ago for a birthday party and my son was going to
[01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:26.400]  somebody else's birthday party and was a camp out off somebody's property there
[01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:30.280]  on a river by their house and it was doctors and lawyers it was well to do
[01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:34.200]  people and I said why are you all here in Wimberley oh because we figured out
[01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:37.520]  five ten years ago there was gonna be a total world government collapse and most
[01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:42.760]  of them didn't even know who I was some did they had already separately figured
[01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:47.520]  all of this out hmm and and the thing is it's incredible I talked I've talked to
[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:51.040]  people that are well-known American billionaire and others who left years
[01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:56.000]  ago and they knew this was all coming so this is common sense because the elite
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:59.240]  is engineering it and so any of the intelligent people out there have
[01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:03.080]  actually researched know it's coming the reason I say identifying the enemy is
[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:06.080]  the biggest solution along all these other solutions that are in the film is
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:09.880]  because they're good if they maintain their power and use this crisis to
[01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:14.640]  expand their power and use the implosion to bring in their police state we have no
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:19.240]  hope so so so as Ron Paul has said we've got to use the crisis they've created to
[01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:23.120]  bring them out of power that's right we have a we have a window and it's not a
[01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:29.040]  long window there's no delaying this this isn't 2002 anymore this is 2010 and
[01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:33.760]  this is happening and there's literally 150 things you need to be doing right
[01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:38.880]  now to do like you say two things protecting you and your family and at
[01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:43.200]  the same time exposing these people because when these guys fall when we
[01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:46.960]  implode we're gonna need to rebuild this thing right and we're gonna need the
[01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:50.600]  best and the brightest to do so so you're not doing anyone good any good
[01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:55.040]  you're not doing anyone any good by pretending that this illusion this
[01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:59.920]  Keynesian economic model is just gonna go on forever it's not like you said it
[01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:04.240]  will fail unfortunately it's gonna fail in our lifetimes and probably in the
[01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:07.560]  next few years and the more they prop it up when it does fail the worse it's
[01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:11.800]  gonna be that's right that's exactly right printing more money and borrowing
[01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:16.920]  more money is not is not the solution to this problem unless you're the mega
[01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:20.800]  banking class that creates the fiat currency and wealth who gets total power
[01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:24.960]  out of it it's great for them at the end of the day we're all poppers everything's
[01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:30.040]  fried we're now a third-world nation but they are in full control with a huge
[01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:34.640]  paramilitary police force to dominate us and that's the game plan I mean this is
[01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:38.880]  it and there's and world government is about this being a planetary takeover I
[01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:42.680]  mean they openly say that in their own writings and that's why it's so important
[01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:47.280]  people get the fall of America and the Western world and again if people can go
[01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:50.880]  to the website what are some other ways they can order it they can also order it

[01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:07.840]  before our guest leaves us we're gonna get his take on how the mainstream media
[01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:11.960]  is demonizing anyone that talks about our country collapsing into world
[01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:14.480]  government they're admitting world government all the news but then saying
[01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:18.080]  you're crazy Nazi if you're your or you don't want government health care
[01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:21.400]  you're a racist that I mean it's like you don't like a ham sandwich you're a
[01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:25.920]  racist I mean you don't like cold weather you're a racist what does that have to
[01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:30.400]  do with it they are desperate to inject division because they're scared of the
[01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:36.040]  American people ever get together black white old young German Chinese Jewish
[01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:41.280]  Eskimo native American whatever against corrupt global corporations that are
[01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:46.280]  engaged in a global corporate takeover none of us have a future and Watson's
[01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:51.120]  got the article up now MSNBC hit piece smears tea party as neo-nazis and we
[01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:55.360]  got from someone inside Chris Matthews operation it's gonna leave it at that it
[01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:59.120]  was very concerned about this demonization just like I got the
[01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:04.560]  machete script from folks and Hispanic members of Rodriguez's staff sent me
[01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:08.600]  that and Rodriguez later said I guess this could cause race for I guess I'm
[01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:11.240]  gonna have to edit this and I wasn't telling him to edit it I was just saying
[01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:15.280]  this this will probably cause some violence I've never it's like a
[01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:18.600]  Hispanic version of birth of a nation or something or but worse I mean it was
[01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:21.920]  just for those that haven't been to film school you can go watch birth of a
[01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:25.280]  nation if you want the point is I understand what I'm talking about this
[01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:30.960]  is all happening right now and MSNBC hit piece smears tea party as neo-nazis
[01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:34.920]  that's coming up no we're talking about what's happening to our country and
[01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:38.360]  warning people that's why we're so popular that's why the mainstream media
[01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:42.720]  is upset doing these demonization pieces and I look at this this this miniseries
[01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:48.120]  the fall of America in the western world a survival guide it's an eight disc DVD
[01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:56.600]  box set and it comes with a survival guide book inside of it and also I just
[01:25:56.600 --> 01:26:01.960]  want to plug this so people get it for a limited time there's a ninth disc they're
[01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:06.080]  offering with it so I guess that comes out to about six and a half dollars per
[01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:11.240]  disc when you get the whole ten ten plus hours again that's amazing tell tell
[01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:14.240]  folks some of the people that are in the fall of America in the western world
[01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:18.040]  absolutely this is important because what's I think another thing that's
[01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:22.760]  interesting about this phenomena is that we have people who are from both sides
[01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:27.160]  of the political aisle people who actually don't agree on anything are
[01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:32.480]  agreeing on one thing and that is America is in any two of its collapse
[01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:37.960]  and these are people who are anarchists radicals libertarians but if you don't
[01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:41.040]  like how Obama's doing the old-spill you must be racist or if you don't like
[01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:44.680]  peppermint she must be racist so you have you don't like my shirt you're
[01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:48.720]  racist right see what does it have to do with it though they just inject that to
[01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:52.360]  distract us yeah it's a distraction distract us I never thought I would have
[01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:58.000]  see the day when an anarchist libertarian multi-millionaire is agreeing with David
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:02.360]  Ike who's agreeing with Alan Greenspan who's agreeing with Naomi Wolf a
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:06.760]  liberal they're all all these people are agreeing that America is collapsing and
[01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:10.160]  you better do something about it so let me answer your question who's in the

[01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:27.040]  this mammoth box set you said think of America as just a metaphor but think of
[01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:31.720]  America as a mansion and they've ripped out the marble and they've ripped out
[01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:36.840]  the wood carvings and the stairs they've ripped out our mansion so I'm now

[01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:07.360]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:11.520]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:15.560]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:19.440]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:23.560]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:27.840]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:32.160]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:35.880]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number

[01:35:39.640 --> 01:35:45.360]  but start back over you use the analogy of we were a mansion the wealthiest in
[01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:49.400]  the world as a country beautifully furnished beautiful plants beautiful
[01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:55.640]  rugs beautiful chandeliers fixtures bookshelves you know there was jewelry
[01:35:55.640 --> 01:36:02.400]  in the you know bedroom in the jewelry box there was a storehouse of knowledge
[01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:09.320]  and now everything is gutted please continue yeah the the mansion analogy
[01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:14.440]  and I'll add one thing to that Alex the whole mansion is gutted but out the
[01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:18.760]  back window of that mansion you have Bernackie and people like him with
[01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:23.440]  bullhorns going it's fine we're in recovery we're in recovery don't worry
[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:27.320]  see there's more jobs now they don't tell you that those are census bureau jobs
[01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:31.440]  and the job is time change the pillars and actually wrecking the the entire
[01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:34.480]  facility so the whole they've got a wrecking ball they're like right don't
[01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:38.760]  worry our day you know we've got the carbon tax it it'll while you're but
[01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:43.480]  destroying the actual superstructure of it you know that'll give you a job right
[01:36:43.480 --> 01:36:46.640]  well you know we'll give you a job putting your own neck in a noose here
[01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:51.800]  exactly so I imagined as you were telling me this mansion analogy and
[01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:57.120]  explaining it to me I imagined the mansion with 12 pillars well I spoke I
[01:36:57.120 --> 01:37:00.800]  told this to Doug Casey the eminent economist who's in the in the series and
[01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:07.760]  he said yeah and two of those pillars have already fallen in 0108 and 09 right
[01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:13.240]  and the other ten are already cracked so this isn't it's very important that we
[01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:20.320]  convey this it's not about oh this could happen in 2012 or 13 or 14 no it's
[01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:24.840]  happening now we're in the middle of it they've already annihilated our economy
[01:37:24.840 --> 01:37:28.200]  NAFTA and GATT is this I mean it's already falling apart and they keep
[01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:31.080]  lying saying it's gonna get better it's gonna get better in just a minute it's
[01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:36.520]  gonna it's gonna be alright yes and so I really I'm cautioning anybody who's
[01:37:36.520 --> 01:37:44.360]  listening and anyone who will listen to me and you to please yes fight them yes
[01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:48.120]  read Ron Paul's book End of the Fed and many others you're a big Ron Paul fan
[01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:53.200]  love Ron what woke you up and for you make that point I think I've always
[01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:58.240]  had a problem with authority and I always question I just never fell right I
[01:37:58.240 --> 01:38:01.760]  always felt like I was being lied to and it became you know you don't question
[01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:05.880]  government sir that's racist all kind of talk yeah Thomas Jefferson was a
[01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:09.480]  terrorist and you may be with him Thomas Jefferson is rolling in his grave
[01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:13.840]  he's whatever everything that he warned he's al-Qaeda he's un-American right
[01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:16.840]  George Washington's even worse come on right come on get with the program
[01:38:16.840 --> 01:38:19.160]  globalization is good right I'm sorry the point you're trying to make one
[01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:21.840]  interrupted you you said if I could just get one thing across the people so I
[01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:27.040]  interrupt if I could just get one thing across to people is this we have to fight
[01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:31.560]  them yes you have to educate yourself and your family and your friends and the
[01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:36.680]  people that belong to your church and temples yes but you have to protect
[01:38:36.680 --> 01:38:43.040]  yourself as well there are things you should be doing right now with regards
[01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:47.000]  to your finances with regards to getting your home in order to getting your block
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:52.440]  in order with regards to knowing how to fight martial law how to fix yourself
[01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:56.480]  spirit not fix yourself but how to get wise spiritual get your head screwed on
[01:38:56.480 --> 01:39:01.480]  get your head screwed on there's things and this movie this series in part I'm
[01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:05.680]  not saying this is the fix all this is the beginning right is is this series
[01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:09.640]  helps people a roadmap it's a roadmap with along with your work and Ron Paul's
[01:39:09.640 --> 01:39:13.080]  work oh no I love I love the fact there's so many great films coming out and
[01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:16.960]  this one is truly different because it is in the long form and really gets into
[01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:22.080]  tail from all these different angles but that creates a gestalt that that that
[01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:26.880]  all tells the same story it tells the same story and and frankly when the
[01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:30.480]  economy collapses or continues to collapse and it gets worse and there are
[01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:34.320]  bread lines and bank failure well we already have 40 million people on food
[01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:37.800]  stamps that's a 21st century bread line right and more unemployment and
[01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:41.480]  hyperinflation and for anybody who doesn't know what that is go Google
[01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:46.280]  hyperinflation Weimar Germany hyperinflation Argentina hyperinflation
[01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:52.440]  Zimbabwe see Americans think that we are impervious to the very same group a
[01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:56.200]  globalist have set this up here exactly and they're saying it's happening in
[01:39:56.200 --> 01:40:02.440]  Greece and Slovenia and Spanels Iceland Iceland exactly so we're not
[01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:07.880]  impervious people Iceland had months of almost no food on the shelves and the
[01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:10.600]  banker said you must give us basically everything and then when the people said
[01:40:10.600 --> 01:40:13.920]  no and ride it for a year if they found out that the bankers really didn't need
[01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:17.680]  all that money it was all a big scam but the question is will we say no and you
[01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:20.880]  know what's interesting Alex and this is what you have been doing so well for so
[01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:27.520]  many years is this when we collapse and there are the bread lines in the bank
[01:40:27.520 --> 01:40:33.440]  failures right ask yourself do you want to be the guy at home or do you want to
[01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:37.040]  be the guy waiting in the bread line because if you prepare yourself now
[01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:41.800]  you'll be the guy at home with your family right and other things now what
[01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:46.440]  happens when this all collapses that's when the Patriot Act and all these other
[01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:50.600]  draconian and what is the media saying they're saying those of us that were
[01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:54.120]  warning and predicted this over a decade ago like George Humphrey the
[01:40:54.120 --> 01:40:59.200]  economist who 12 years ago on my show predicted it all and said by 2009 2010
[01:40:59.200 --> 01:41:03.400]  11 and he's not just an economist he's successful in private business that's
[01:41:03.400 --> 01:41:06.160]  the real market somebody who knows what they're doing right and he said look
[01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:08.880]  this is designed to destroy us they've done it in the third world they're gonna
[01:41:08.880 --> 01:41:13.320]  do it here and now we're here we've been right and instead of getting a gold star
[01:41:13.320 --> 01:41:16.680]  and saying hey these guys are great let's listen to Ron Paul let's listen to
[01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:20.880]  Alex Jones know Chris Matthews says in this new piece I have the script is
[01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:25.360]  coming out next Wednesday that we are basically Nazis with no evidence I mean
[01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:30.680]  it's like we're the enemy we're the bad guys we have to be dealt with now again
[01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:35.800]  because they are they are the bad guys Chris Matthews represents the real bad
[01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:41.040]  guys and they know that if we have credibility they're gonna get defeated
[01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:44.760]  so the bad guys are saying we're the terrorist and in all their training their
[01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:47.960]  Homeland Security Microports it's us the gun owners the conservatives the
[01:41:47.960 --> 01:41:53.600]  libertarians the anti-war activist anybody who is really for freedom and
[01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:57.920]  transparency we are what Homeland Security is designed for it's not for
[01:41:57.920 --> 01:42:02.640]  the people with turbines go ahead it's just interesting to me that when we're
[01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:07.440]  we actually hear them say we're in a recovery but what's funny is that they
[01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:11.160]  talk out of two sides of their mouth because when Alan Greenspan is saying
[01:42:11.160 --> 01:42:15.440]  we're in a we're hitting a credit tsunami Alan Greenspan this isn't Ron Paul
[01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:20.160]  that's Alan Greenspan when Comptroller David Walker is saying this is 25 times
[01:42:20.160 --> 01:42:24.560]  bigger than what we thought and those people are agreeing with you Alex Jones
[01:42:24.560 --> 01:42:28.040]  who are agreeing with Ron Paul who's agreeing with anarchists and radicals
[01:42:28.040 --> 01:42:34.240]  and leftists and and socialists people please it's time to pay attention right
[01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:37.840]  now exactly the problem is the bankers who engineered this though they're
[01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:41.560]  saying oh it's 25 times and worse according to the comments we've talked
[01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:46.680]  to it's more like 500 times worse and they know that they knew when they
[01:42:46.680 --> 01:42:51.360]  created 1.5 quadrillion in derivatives hundreds and hundreds some cases
[01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:57.640]  thousands more fake wealth than there is real assets in the planet they knew that
[01:42:57.640 --> 01:43:01.080]  they got all the power on the way up they could buy anybody and on the way
[01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:06.220]  down they still poses the savior and enslave everyone I mean it is a life and
[01:43:06.220 --> 01:43:08.840]  death situation Ron Paul and others who are great economists and he's an
[01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:11.800]  economist as well much the medical doctor and he's been given doctorates
[01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:16.880]  for his research and papers on it from von Mies and others they have you know
[01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:20.360]  put on record that there's a way to monetize the debt but not have the
[01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:23.640]  bankers monetize it there's a way to fix this it's gonna be painful but we
[01:43:23.640 --> 01:43:28.080]  should have done it a decade ago I mean now we are wrecked any way you cut it
[01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:31.760]  but if we let these people continue to pilot things they're not gonna give us
[01:43:31.760 --> 01:43:35.360]  any quarter that's right and they're not gonna stop listen if Ron Paul got
[01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:39.520]  elected president right we went back on the gold standard and we ended the Fed
[01:43:39.520 --> 01:43:45.160]  tomorrow we'd still be in a boatload of trouble but that ain't gonna happen I
[01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:50.960]  don't think no no so we're in real real trouble and you know I'm right out there
[01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:54.840]  with you fighting this but I'm also gonna look out for myself I'm also gonna

[01:44:50.800 --> 01:45:06.520]  1-800-655-1577 that's 1-800-655-1577 now Brian Kraft is our guest in studio
[01:45:06.520 --> 01:45:10.360]  right now the filmmaker along with Jimmy Petula and others that made the fall
[01:45:10.360 --> 01:45:14.160]  of America and the western world survival guide but I want to shift gears
[01:45:14.160 --> 01:45:17.600]  into something that that because I keep going back to the demonization the good
[01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:22.360]  news is when they demonized Rand Paul in the last three weeks and lied about what
[01:45:22.360 --> 01:45:27.200]  he said and and changed the transcript from Rachel Maddow where he had a three
[01:45:27.200 --> 01:45:30.680]  second delay and he was going excuse me excuse me yes yes I can hear you she's
[01:45:30.680 --> 01:45:32.960]  like what yes you're forgetting about the civil rights act he says well no I
[01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:36.720]  didn't say that I can't hear and then they changed the transcript and that's
[01:45:36.720 --> 01:45:39.240]  not even one of his issues he doesn't even talk about it it's not on his
[01:45:39.240 --> 01:45:42.600]  platform he made clear he doesn't want to get rid of the civil rights act but
[01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:46.600]  it's another media hoax just like they you know Howard Dean's not perfect but
[01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:51.720]  he's better than Obama and so they made a big deal out of his roar when there
[01:45:51.720 --> 01:45:55.160]  was a crowd screaming but he had a cordial mic where you could only hear
[01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:58.440]  him basically and they made you know hyped that oh we can't have Howard Dean
[01:45:58.440 --> 01:46:02.000]  who would have beaten Bush but the cousin Kerry ran instead and so I mean the
[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:06.640]  point is they rigged these things this big hoax of oh my gosh Rand Paul can't
[01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:11.920]  win now his poll numbers in every major poll went up after the three weeks of
[01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:17.920]  demonization so as a filmmaker I want to play for you the trailer the short
[01:46:17.920 --> 01:46:26.040]  trailer from the rise of the new right a documentary that is being put out right
[01:46:26.040 --> 01:46:32.160]  now and it's airing next Wednesday have a message from the Tea Party we've come
[01:46:32.160 --> 01:46:36.960]  to take our government back there's a rising tide on the right I think the
[01:46:36.960 --> 01:46:41.200]  government's too big voice not just by extremists but by recruits from the
[01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:47.400]  neighborhood the Tea Party is determined to take power what does that mean for
[01:46:47.400 --> 01:46:54.000]  America we are deep terror deep deep I'm Chris Matthews with a hard look at the
[01:46:54.000 --> 01:47:03.520]  rise of the new right June 16th at 7 on MSNBC now we knew that this was going to
[01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:11.000]  be a hit piece early on but I actually last night we got the script sent to us
[01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:14.440]  by somebody inside MSNBC that is concerned about it and it's worse than I
[01:47:14.440 --> 01:47:20.440]  even thought I mean it is it is incredible it implies I word for word
[01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:25.160]  that I'm gonna make my listeners go out and murder everyone it says that this is
[01:47:25.160 --> 01:47:29.280]  the same stuff Hitler said and that we're basically the new Hitler and that
[01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:32.640]  those of us that don't like what the banks are doing are Nazis with no
[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:37.240]  evidence I mean this is a desperation move what's your take on it if it is a
[01:47:37.240 --> 01:47:43.640]  desperation move look the people in power the elite they know exactly what
[01:47:43.640 --> 01:47:48.720]  they've done it's planned it's built into Keynesian economics they always
[01:47:48.720 --> 01:47:54.000]  inevitably fail they always inevitably can collapse the system and then move
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:59.120]  on to something else right and prop it up again for 20 30 40 50 60 years and
[01:47:59.120 --> 01:48:03.400]  then it collapses again that's how it's because the Ponzi scheme gives them an
[01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:06.800]  unfair trade advantage that's right so they've got to run a Ponzi scheme but
[01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:10.640]  they don't go to jail like Madoff at the end they become your dictator right they
[01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:16.200]  spend the money before the inflation kicks in right so of course they're
[01:48:16.200 --> 01:48:21.800]  doing that they are in a that we're in a time right now where they are putting
[01:48:21.800 --> 01:48:26.480]  their what would you say Alice they're putting their the final the ribbon on
[01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:29.240]  their present to the world they're bringing us into the controlled
[01:48:29.240 --> 01:48:32.720]  implosion but the problem and they say this in their own writings is the world
[01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:37.440]  is awake and looking past Obama past Bush past Gordon Brown past Angela
[01:48:37.440 --> 01:48:44.240]  Merkel past Nicholas Sarkozy past Rod to the power structure and they are
[01:48:44.240 --> 01:48:47.560]  really concerned that they may have bitten off more than they chew that's
[01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:51.760]  right it beats between that and knowing that this is supposed to implode they're
[01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:57.480]  doing everything they know they can do right now to keep you further and further
[01:48:57.480 --> 01:49:02.920]  in the dark while they race to militarize police and to set up more
[01:49:02.920 --> 01:49:07.480]  prisons and to try to amps I mean I think it's important that we were quickly
[01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:11.720]  talk about what the world could look like when the economy crashes I talk
[01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:16.440]  about that whether it's a year two three or four years right well what would we
[01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:20.840]  think would happen if there are bread lines if the supermarket closes and you
[01:49:20.840 --> 01:49:25.320]  have not listened to us today right and you don't have food for your family
[01:49:25.320 --> 01:49:28.760]  right and you don't listen to us today and you don't have anything you're safe
[01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:32.880]  at home right and you can't get to your gold and you don't have firearms and you
[01:49:32.880 --> 01:49:37.120]  don't have firearms and you're not off the grid and you're completely reliant
[01:49:37.120 --> 01:49:42.240]  upon the system that has lied to you since birth of course you're gonna be
[01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:45.560]  angry of course you're gonna go out in the street to try and fend for your
[01:49:45.560 --> 01:49:49.320]  and look at Haiti whether they have 200,000 people die thousands dying a
[01:49:49.320 --> 01:49:54.680]  week you don't hear about them anymore mm-hmm exactly so when that happens when
[01:49:54.680 --> 01:49:57.800]  you have the bank failures and the supermarkets closing and look I want to
[01:49:57.800 --> 01:50:02.600]  say one thing I hope I'm wrong and I know I sound inflammatory well
[01:50:02.600 --> 01:50:05.520]  regardless we're already in a real depression and the question is how
[01:50:05.520 --> 01:50:08.840]  severe right and every every evidence shows it's gonna be the biggest ever
[01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:12.840]  the biggest ever I mean when you've got people again when you've got noted
[01:50:12.840 --> 01:50:16.920]  multimillionaire economists agreeing with Alan Greenspan and and Warren Buffett
[01:50:16.920 --> 01:50:23.680]  saying it's the greater or greatest depression people look out get to work
[01:50:23.680 --> 01:50:28.840]  right now you still have time we're not in the middle of this yet right if this
[01:50:28.840 --> 01:50:32.840]  were 1929 you still have a few years but it you got to start now because this
[01:50:32.840 --> 01:50:36.440]  work takes time yeah for two and a half years of for 29 they were saying it's
[01:50:36.440 --> 01:50:40.600]  fine it's fixed and then 33 is when they announced here's your new
[01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:45.800]  president war powers act you know turn your gold in this is we know we're in a
[01:50:45.800 --> 01:50:49.080]  depression and then that destroyed confidence even more we'll be right back

[01:54:55.000 --> 01:55:00.840]  up for potential attack on US soil they are really hyping that oh homeland
[01:55:00.840 --> 01:55:04.800]  brigade and the tens of thousands of regular army that are deploying to take
[01:55:04.800 --> 01:55:08.520]  on American terrorist we get their internal documents all about fighting
[01:55:08.520 --> 01:55:11.880]  gun owners conservatives landowners they're saying we're gearing up for
[01:55:11.880 --> 01:55:16.400]  attacks on American soil ahead of going into Iran so they want to start World
[01:55:16.400 --> 01:55:21.120]  War 3 so you will accept the financial collapse because after all our boys are
[01:55:21.120 --> 01:55:25.840]  dying in Iran and even though we're in a breadline here and you know the carbon
[01:55:25.840 --> 01:55:30.320]  taxes coming in as part of the new austerity we our grandparents had to do
[01:55:30.320 --> 01:55:33.720]  the same thing in the greatest generation there's lots of money for
[01:55:33.720 --> 01:55:37.880]  government to be made with ration cards and all the insider trading and if you
[01:55:37.880 --> 01:55:42.120]  criticize it well they just send thugs by to arrest you because criticizing the
[01:55:42.120 --> 01:55:46.760]  government during wars treason the bankers got to take all the money we're
[01:55:46.760 --> 01:55:53.400]  fighting Alcatraz bin Laden's in in in Iran CIA admits they're putting out fake
[01:55:53.400 --> 01:55:57.240]  videos but that's okay US Northcom gears up for potential attack and then the
[01:55:57.240 --> 01:56:02.280]  New York Times article should this be the last generation and it says Peter
[01:56:02.280 --> 01:56:06.560]  Singer who's a top eugenicist he says for the earth we shouldn't be allowed to
[01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:11.640]  have any children Mr. Kraft so we have some really nice people taken over our
[01:56:11.640 --> 01:56:17.120]  society this is the type of stuff just pouring in second by second here as the
[01:56:17.120 --> 01:56:20.760]  people running the system make their insane pronouncements and then we're
[01:56:20.760 --> 01:56:25.040]  bad to say we don't want to turn over our land we want to be able to have kids
[01:56:25.040 --> 01:56:28.680]  we don't want to turn in our guns and live like they do in Chicago at the
[01:56:28.680 --> 01:56:34.080]  mercy of criminals that's right it's it's it's it always has been forced
[01:56:34.080 --> 01:56:40.840]  coercion and it's heating up and it's getting worse and it's time well most
[01:56:40.840 --> 01:56:44.200]  of your listeners I hope are doing something already I just also hope that
[01:56:44.200 --> 01:56:48.520]  they're doing something to protect themselves as they fight this nonsense
[01:56:48.520 --> 01:56:52.840]  do you ever pinch yourself like it's surreal though like like like you can't
[01:56:52.840 --> 01:56:57.640]  believe what's happening I can't believe that we are the son and heirs of this
[01:56:57.640 --> 01:57:03.000]  global catastrophe that has all been orchestrated I can't believe it's
[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:07.400]  happening you know it's unfortunate it really is because I love this country I
[01:57:07.400 --> 01:57:11.160]  want to say that I'm this isn't a love letter to the fall of America and the
[01:57:11.160 --> 01:57:16.000]  Western world this this 10-part series is by no means a love letter I'm saddened
[01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:21.240]  by this you know and it's it's it's horrible what they've done to and the
[01:57:21.240 --> 01:57:26.280]  globalists love it the globalists love it because by wrecking things they make
[01:57:26.280 --> 01:57:30.720]  us dependent I mean listen all the freedoms they're gone I mean that I
[01:57:30.720 --> 01:57:34.160]  mean this is now bondage folks this is police all over the country are
[01:57:34.160 --> 01:57:38.600]  charging people with felonies if you videotape them but the our country looks
[01:57:38.600 --> 01:57:41.880]  like an air feet not looks like feels like an airport now with people
[01:57:41.880 --> 01:57:46.520]  reporting to go here and people go report here go here stop here do this
[01:57:46.520 --> 01:57:51.160]  this is draconian legislation that we've allowed them to pass right they now
[01:57:51.160 --> 01:57:54.880]  admit they record your naked body and then the guards beat each other up
[01:57:54.880 --> 01:57:58.960]  because they make fun of each other's genitals and movie stars come through now
[01:57:58.960 --> 01:58:02.280]  and they print off their naked body and women run up and say please sign it the

[02:00:44.160 --> 02:00:49.600]  studio with us and I just want to thank you for being with us today and the time
[02:00:49.600 --> 02:00:55.320]  we've got left it is sad I mean every day I get upset that I've been right
[02:00:55.320 --> 02:00:58.920]  about everything I get upset that it's all worse than I thought when Herman
[02:00:58.920 --> 02:01:01.120]  Von Roompie the head of the EU comes out and says we're gonna have a global
[02:01:01.120 --> 02:01:04.080]  government you're gonna pay your carbon taxes to us the very banks that
[02:01:04.080 --> 02:01:10.160]  engineered it I get upset I don't get oh great I mean I already knew it but to
[02:01:10.160 --> 02:01:13.400]  have them confirm it it's like 14 years ago I was sent documents by a nurse in
[02:01:13.400 --> 02:01:16.880]  San Antonio how the blood's taken and put in Pentagon databases for DNA
[02:01:16.880 --> 02:01:21.280]  databases and eugenics on all children and then I later I had Australian
[02:01:21.280 --> 02:01:25.160]  government parliament members on I had a congressman on from Virginia in the
[02:01:25.160 --> 02:01:29.200]  last decade I didn't get happy when the news came out admitted it in the last
[02:01:29.200 --> 02:01:32.680]  year okay we've got your blood it goes to the Pentagon I got I was watching a
[02:01:32.680 --> 02:01:36.760]  CNN clip last night where they were saying it was good you know I mean it's
[02:01:36.760 --> 02:01:42.560]  sick it's sick how and it's sick how passive the public is folks when you're
[02:01:42.560 --> 02:01:47.360]  passive if you were passive with an employee who they'd run all over you if
[02:01:47.360 --> 02:01:51.680]  you know a lot of bad employees if you were passive with a neighbor or you know
[02:01:51.680 --> 02:01:55.600]  what about a family you've had before like a big brother who's a punk who I
[02:01:55.600 --> 02:01:58.800]  mean if you just gave into everything or a girlfriend or a boyfriend if you're
[02:01:58.800 --> 02:02:02.720]  passive they'll take advantage you let alone the US government or any government
[02:02:02.720 --> 02:02:09.720]  any government run by global elites who aren't patriots that's what they've done
[02:02:09.720 --> 02:02:13.520]  folks that's what they have a bunch of Wall Street crooks are robbing us and
[02:02:13.520 --> 02:02:17.880]  we're surprised exactly and they're telling us we're gonna drug test you
[02:02:17.880 --> 02:02:20.560]  we're gonna put you through naked body scanners we're building prisons we're
[02:02:20.560 --> 02:02:24.560]  gonna have checkpoints we're gonna do all this and that's just the way it is

[02:02:30.360 --> 02:02:36.960]  don't believe this nonsense that the recession is over or that 08 or 09 was
[02:02:36.960 --> 02:02:41.800]  the worst it's going to get it's going to get a whole lot worse according not
[02:02:41.800 --> 02:02:46.800]  to me according to the experts and notables in our 10-part series well I
[02:02:46.800 --> 02:02:50.000]  mean it's great to see all your experts and I'm one of them but I mean I got the
[02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:53.080]  globalist documents right we know what they've done all over the third world we
[02:02:53.080 --> 02:02:57.400]  have the timber wolf documents McClatchy has all the documents on how how
[02:02:57.400 --> 02:03:01.400]  Goldman Sachs who runs all the major regulatory agencies of the countries
[02:03:01.400 --> 02:03:05.560]  they're robbing they're the key group they're there on record saying we're
[02:03:05.560 --> 02:03:08.920]  gonna sell it by derivatives and implode it then get bailouts and destroy our
[02:03:08.920 --> 02:03:13.600]  competition I mean this is the they're on record mm-hmm that's what Wall Street
[02:03:13.600 --> 02:03:16.880]  does it goes into healthy companies and destroys them it goes into healthy
[02:03:16.880 --> 02:03:21.520]  nations and destroys them breaks them up this isn't free market these are
[02:03:21.520 --> 02:03:27.400]  crocs it's the opposite of free market this is not free market these people do
[02:03:27.400 --> 02:03:32.240]  not have your best interest at heart just the opposite everything they do is
[02:03:32.240 --> 02:03:36.360]  counterproductive to your security and that's why you need to listen to shows

[02:08:22.560 --> 02:08:28.920]  headline MSNBC has guessed analyst on saying buy guns barbed wire and farmland
[02:08:28.920 --> 02:08:33.240]  more and more people are sounding just like Gerald Salento has been predicting
[02:08:33.240 --> 02:08:37.360]  exactly what's happening right now for at least the last six to seven years with
[02:08:37.360 --> 02:08:43.040]  precision he called it in 2008 he said with by 2010 the stimulus would have
[02:08:43.040 --> 02:08:48.560]  run out by the middle of 2010 it would be clear that the establishment knew full
[02:08:48.560 --> 02:08:54.080]  well what was happening that's now unfolding and I have in incredible news
[02:08:54.080 --> 02:09:01.480]  here we actually got the MSNBC script for the rise of the new right special
[02:09:01.480 --> 02:09:05.680]  they're gonna be airing over and over again starting next Wednesday hosted by
[02:09:05.680 --> 02:09:11.200]  Chris Matthews they lied to me but I knew they were lying I told them I said
[02:09:11.200 --> 02:09:17.640]  this will be me cut into neo-nazis and malicious and you will demonize Ron
[02:09:17.640 --> 02:09:21.120]  Paul and Rand Paul and they said no no we're just profiling you and it's all
[02:09:21.120 --> 02:09:25.120]  friendly we want to know the tea party well I have the script none of what I
[02:09:25.120 --> 02:09:29.000]  said was in there basically it's all distorted nothing about reaching out to
[02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:32.760]  the controlled left explaining to them that you know the false left-right
[02:09:32.760 --> 02:09:37.680]  paradigm none of it it is worse than I thought and the article is up on
[02:09:37.680 --> 02:09:44.520]  prisonplanet.com MSNBC hit piece smears tea party as neo-nazis this is so
[02:09:44.520 --> 02:09:50.480]  important and so we're gonna get Gerald Salente's take on that on the economy on
[02:09:50.480 --> 02:09:55.800]  the Iran situation the Israeli flotilla all of it really Gerald Salente needs no
[02:09:55.800 --> 02:09:59.800]  introduction I can look at our prisonplanet.tv numbers our web

[02:10:48.320 --> 02:10:54.120]  well thanks for having me Alex a lot going on I want to get to the economy
[02:10:54.120 --> 02:10:58.880]  first but what is your take on the Mayak report the Homeland Security reports
[02:10:58.880 --> 02:11:02.960]  demonizing patriots gun owners now got the New York Times where they're
[02:11:02.960 --> 02:11:07.000]  cracking down on Amish trying to take their property saying it's not good for
[02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:11.920]  the environment that their cows are defecating them and that's not normal
[02:11:11.920 --> 02:11:16.960]  now I mean you cannot make this up this is a full-out assault on anyone who
[02:11:16.960 --> 02:11:23.680]  wants to be self-sufficient I've said this before that in the mainstream media
[02:11:23.680 --> 02:11:30.680]  and a number of these talk show blowhards out there they keep calling
[02:11:30.680 --> 02:11:35.360]  what's going on in America socialism the ones that don't like Obama we've made
[02:11:35.360 --> 02:11:40.560]  it very clear that the merger of state and corporate powers by definition is
[02:11:40.560 --> 02:11:46.240]  called fascism so what we're seeing is first we're seeing the merger of state
[02:11:46.240 --> 02:11:51.040]  and corporate powers like never before with the whole guys of the two big to
[02:11:51.040 --> 02:11:57.520]  fails and look at the facts you go back to their early 1990s the top banks the
[02:11:57.520 --> 02:12:07.160]  top six banks had about 15% of the action out there now the top six banks
[02:12:07.160 --> 02:12:14.920]  control 65% of all the financial assets in the United States so as we become more
[02:12:14.920 --> 02:12:20.360]  fascist what you're seeing now is the squeezing of the little people all those
[02:12:20.360 --> 02:12:25.240]  dangerous Amish you have to really watch out for them you never know when
[02:12:25.240 --> 02:12:30.160]  their horse and buggies will be taken over another town and it squeezed the
[02:12:30.160 --> 02:12:33.480]  little people at every end look what they're doing to the small farmers
[02:12:33.480 --> 02:12:38.320]  making it almost impossible for them to compete as they're becoming more popular
[02:12:38.320 --> 02:12:44.160]  look at the numbers what is the IRS doing they're cracking down on the
[02:12:44.160 --> 02:12:49.080]  little people as they're turning a blind eye to the big corporations so that's
[02:12:49.080 --> 02:12:55.240]  what's going on and as you pointed out well how the MSNBC did a
[02:12:55.240 --> 02:13:00.400]  snow job on you they do it with everybody in making the Tea Party look
[02:13:00.400 --> 02:13:06.120]  like as though it's a right-wing fanatical movement of right-wing nuts
[02:13:06.120 --> 02:13:13.000]  and it's the same story let's go back over the history in 2007 in the trends
[02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:17.760]  journal our top trend for that year while Bush was president was that we were
[02:13:17.760 --> 02:13:23.080]  going to see the emergence of major tax revolts what did they do they ignored
[02:13:23.080 --> 02:13:29.880]  it in 2009 the first tea parties until protests tax protests what did they do
[02:13:29.880 --> 02:13:35.040]  in the mainstream media they ridiculed it they said it was going nowhere and
[02:13:35.040 --> 02:13:39.960]  then as they could no longer turn a blind eye to it and it started gaining
[02:13:39.960 --> 02:13:45.480]  momentum what do they do next they demonize it so that's so it's a very
[02:13:45.480 --> 02:13:49.520]  familiar pattern we know where they're going and they're not going to be able
[02:13:49.520 --> 02:13:54.960]  to stop it it has a life of its own well that's my next point we see three
[02:13:54.960 --> 02:13:59.760]  weeks of a hoax saying that Rand Paul wants to get rid of the civil rights
[02:13:59.760 --> 02:14:03.760]  Act which he never even talked about is not on his platform he said no I don't
[02:14:03.760 --> 02:14:10.480]  and they said no yes you do and his approval rating went up in one poll was
[02:14:10.480 --> 02:14:17.080]  16% it went up to 20% another poll was 20% it went up to 25% he gained between
[02:14:17.080 --> 02:14:23.600]  three to six points and a whole index of polls after three weeks of 24 seven
[02:14:23.600 --> 02:14:27.680]  basically saying he was the second coming of Adolf Hitler so what does that
[02:14:27.680 --> 02:14:32.040]  say to Chris Matthews and others that's what I told Politico I said look if you
[02:14:32.040 --> 02:14:39.000]  want to hurt Rand Paul endorse him you guys are shooting an empty gun more and
[02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:43.440]  more there's less and less people that believe a word that comes out of your
[02:14:43.440 --> 02:14:51.040]  stinking mouth of course it's it's the same old belt Washington Beltway circle
[02:14:51.040 --> 02:14:57.840]  jerk turn them on it's the same guys over and over and the same tired old
[02:14:57.840 --> 02:15:04.040]  faces saying the same old things the only people that are listening to them
[02:15:04.040 --> 02:15:10.280]  are themselves the whole nation is going in another direction again we'll
[02:15:10.280 --> 02:15:15.760]  only stick with the facts they ridicule the Tea Party they said it would go
[02:15:15.760 --> 02:15:21.320]  nowhere the lefties hate them they've turned them into you know again a
[02:15:21.320 --> 02:15:28.000]  stereotype that does not encompass the full meaning of the movement so just as
[02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:33.000]  they do Alex when there's a mass demonstration like the ones they just
[02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:38.920]  had in Greece or the ones they have in the US they throw in the agents
[02:15:38.920 --> 02:15:44.920]  provocateurs to make it seem as though the whole thing is nothing but an
[02:15:44.920 --> 02:15:50.680]  anarchist movement they're doing the same thing by demonizing the Tea Party
[02:15:50.680 --> 02:15:57.120]  sure there are lunatics in there unlike the respectable lunatics in the
[02:15:57.120 --> 02:16:03.920]  Democratic Party like president of Obama who has sent more troops into
[02:16:03.920 --> 02:16:09.800]  Afghanistan who has expanded the mass murder in Pakistan
[02:16:09.800 --> 02:16:16.560]  although very respectable because as you've heard me say they're among the
[02:16:16.560 --> 02:16:22.600]  elites the Harvard Princeton Yale Bullets bombs and banks group they only
[02:16:22.600 --> 02:16:27.840]  do things with pinkies up in a dignified way they kill you with drones
[02:16:27.840 --> 02:16:36.280]  God forbid they would never have an AK-47 so what they do is they make it seem as
[02:16:36.280 --> 02:16:43.360]  though the people on ever the movement are all out of their minds they're all
[02:16:43.360 --> 02:16:48.960]  head to the hills with pork and beans and barricade yourself in because the
[02:16:48.960 --> 02:16:53.600]  end of the world is coming movement rather than sit rather than admitting to
[02:16:53.600 --> 02:16:58.480]  the depth and breadth of this movement it's not going to be the Tea Party that
[02:16:58.480 --> 02:17:03.760]  really brings to get brings forth to change but it's the first element of
[02:17:03.760 --> 02:17:09.520]  something very big I said this over and over again and I'll say it's the same
[02:17:09.520 --> 02:17:15.120]  sword to pop out to show us that the country is very sick yeah again it's
[02:17:15.120 --> 02:17:21.080]  it's the beginning of the second American Revolution it's underway the
[02:17:21.080 --> 02:17:29.000]  Chris Matthews the Obermans the rest of them are not going to stop it it's
[02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:35.360]  happening they could ridicule it all they want again it's the same Washington
[02:17:35.360 --> 02:17:41.240]  Beltway circle jerk you know I try going to these websites you know the liberal
[02:17:41.240 --> 02:17:46.080]  ones like war story oh they they they they're so proud of calling themselves
[02:17:46.080 --> 02:17:51.640]  progressives progressives every day in there they have what John Stewart said
[02:17:51.640 --> 02:17:59.440]  what Stephen Colbert said how about what Bozo the clowns said clowns that's it
[02:17:59.440 --> 02:18:05.600]  and these are the ones they look up to so the liberals look up to the clowns the
[02:18:05.600 --> 02:18:12.680]  the Colbert's and the Stewart's and they make fun of the rest it's incredible and
[02:18:12.680 --> 02:18:15.440]  in the right when you think Sarah Palin's gonna save them but that's not
[02:18:15.440 --> 02:18:18.400]  gonna happen and the other good news is every incumbent whether Republican or
[02:18:18.400 --> 02:18:24.480]  Democrat whether it's Ireland Specter or Grayson they are all being thrown out
[02:18:24.480 --> 02:18:29.560]  by the more extreme the more extreme you are according to mainstream media because
[02:18:29.560 --> 02:18:34.560]  they're up on the hill like Buddha pronouncing what reality is the more
[02:18:34.560 --> 02:18:38.920]  extreme you are the more the mainstream media demonizes you the faster you get
[02:18:38.920 --> 02:18:43.560]  put into office you know again look at the people had just won the elections
[02:18:43.560 --> 02:18:49.200]  yesterday oh you're real fireballs out there in California for governor and

[02:19:10.240 --> 02:19:15.320]  whole level that was never admitted to before they can't withstand it so what
[02:19:15.320 --> 02:19:20.240]  did they do they take the cheap shots look what just happened with this woman

[02:22:24.920 --> 02:22:29.360]  ever experienced this is not only a transfer of power to an institution that
[02:22:29.360 --> 02:22:32.560]  is not accountable to our elected government but has also caused the

[02:24:54.800 --> 02:24:59.040]  next hour questions for Gerald Salente I want to get back into what's
[02:24:59.040 --> 02:25:03.480]  happening with North Korea the media saying Ben Laudans now and I ran he's
[02:25:03.480 --> 02:25:06.640]  like a chess piece they move I mean they could move him I guess to the Amish
[02:25:06.640 --> 02:25:10.200]  property they're trying to take right now and say you know Ben Laudans in a
[02:25:10.200 --> 02:25:14.680]  Pennsylvania Amish community we've got a we've got to drop nukes on them I want
[02:25:14.680 --> 02:25:17.960]  to discuss that what's happening in North Korea but before we go any further
[02:25:17.960 --> 02:25:23.200]  your trends forecast on the economy investment banker it's going to get
[02:25:23.200 --> 02:25:28.640]  nasty by land barbed wire that's CNBC here's the Wall Street Journal headline
[02:25:28.640 --> 02:25:33.960]  tax hikes and the 2011 economic collapse today's corporate profits reflected
[02:25:33.960 --> 02:25:39.080]  income shift in 010 these profits will tumble next year preceded most likely
[02:25:39.080 --> 02:25:43.880]  by the stock market and North comes in the news today Gerald saying Al Qaeda is
[02:25:43.880 --> 02:25:50.080]  going to hit we got to put army on the streets yeah well it is collapsing and
[02:25:50.080 --> 02:25:53.520]  there's nothing that they could do to stop it we saw what's going on in Europe
[02:25:53.520 --> 02:26:01.160]  with the the Greek tragedy the trillion dollars that they just spent to help bail
[02:26:01.160 --> 02:26:07.200]  out Greece Spain Portugal Italy and others and then we heard Angela Merkel
[02:26:07.200 --> 02:26:11.960]  the Chancellor of Germany say that you know this is only a temporary measure
[02:26:11.960 --> 02:26:17.480]  it's not going to fix the problem of course it's not you don't you don't put
[02:26:17.480 --> 02:26:24.640]  on more debt on top of old debt to to to revive an economy and then plus
[02:26:24.640 --> 02:26:30.120]  putting austerity measures into place so we're looking at the collapse of the
[02:26:30.120 --> 02:26:36.320]  crash of 2010 it's going to happen before the clock strikes 2011 let's look at
[02:26:36.320 --> 02:26:41.640]  the facts Alex as you mentioned we said that in 2010 the stimulus money would
[02:26:41.640 --> 02:26:46.720]  start to run out last week we saw the unemployment numbers come in they
[02:26:46.720 --> 02:26:56.000]  expected 150,000 to 160,000 jobs to be created in the private sector 41,000
[02:26:56.000 --> 02:27:06.680]  were created out of 95 95% of all the jobs created in May were census workers
[02:27:06.680 --> 02:27:11.800]  temporary job and interrupt Gerald that's even using rigged numbers we
[02:27:11.800 --> 02:27:15.920]  learn at least a half a million people are fired and hired each month in the
[02:27:15.920 --> 02:27:21.560]  census and then counted as new jobs who even with cooked books 95% or government
[02:27:21.560 --> 02:27:28.360]  right and then they're gonna be gone by the end of the summer then why and I
[02:27:28.360 --> 02:27:34.160]  think what you're saying is what we're saying and that is when all else fails
[02:27:34.160 --> 02:27:41.560]  they lead you to war and just as we're seeing the ineptitude of the government
[02:27:41.560 --> 02:27:47.240]  by dealing with this tragedy in the Gulf with the oil spill just as we saw their
[02:27:47.240 --> 02:27:53.640]  Katrina quality rescue skills just as they keep fighting losing wars on
[02:27:53.640 --> 02:28:00.480]  drugs just as they fail to improve the education system with leaving no child
[02:28:00.480 --> 02:28:08.600]  left behind or any other scheme just as they lose with health care reform just
[02:28:08.600 --> 02:28:16.040]  as they lose with financial reform the military alusers too this week we lost
[02:28:16.040 --> 02:28:24.840]  what 17 US troops in Afghanistan in a losing war that's costing hundreds of
[02:28:24.840 --> 02:28:30.400]  billions that's going to cost more lost lives and that's going to be a loser
[02:28:30.400 --> 02:28:37.360]  war at the end so to divert our attention Iran looks like the next war
[02:28:37.360 --> 02:28:42.000]  that they will start and lose so that they can't admit to their other
[02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:49.360]  failures Gerald the CIA as you know two weeks ago bragged to the Washington
[02:28:49.360 --> 02:28:54.240]  Post that they had put out fake bin Laden video so that's now confirmed we

[02:28:59.200 --> 02:29:06.680]  propaganda front saying that bin Laden is in Iran with no proof they're just
[02:29:06.680 --> 02:29:14.120]  saying this right on time for world war three with Iran yes and then this whole
[02:29:14.120 --> 02:29:20.800]  spring trends journal is the great war that the United States and our quote
[02:29:20.800 --> 02:29:28.160]  allies are leading us to look a couple of weeks ago we saw the German president
[02:29:28.160 --> 02:29:35.800]  resign and why did he resign he admitted why they're in Afghanistan and they're

[02:32:02.200 --> 02:32:06.640]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[02:32:06.640 --> 02:32:10.640]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[02:32:10.640 --> 02:32:14.600]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[02:32:14.600 --> 02:32:18.600]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:32:18.600 --> 02:32:23.160]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[02:32:23.160 --> 02:32:27.160]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[02:32:27.160 --> 02:32:31.000]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:34.600]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather

[02:33:12.680 --> 02:33:17.120]  Chris Matthews hit piece because this is a new level in demonization propaganda
[02:33:17.120 --> 02:33:21.160]  of Rand Paul myself and others I may have to go into overdrive the end of the

[02:35:29.760 --> 02:35:33.880]  years ago to do a radio show in a local tv show I never intended to be as
[02:35:33.880 --> 02:35:38.160]  successful as I am but it's the message of how successful other activists and

[02:36:04.720 --> 02:36:08.680]  of me here ranting about the documentaries let's go back to Gerald
[02:36:08.680 --> 02:36:14.240]  Solente but speaking of solutions you know I I think evergreen is the name of
[02:36:14.240 --> 02:36:19.520]  the game in really convincing people when somebody sees a film I made like
[02:36:19.520 --> 02:36:24.720]  road to tyranny eight years ago and everything in it came true I found my
[02:36:24.720 --> 02:36:28.320]  older films are even more effective than my new one sometimes because people can
[02:36:28.320 --> 02:36:31.000]  go this guy how do you how do you know this eight years ago they can watch my
[02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:35.160]  first film made 13 years ago America destroyed by design and they say how did
[02:36:35.160 --> 02:36:38.600]  this guy know this it's the same thing with the trends journal you know it's
[02:36:38.600 --> 02:36:42.640]  great to get the latest trends journal which is important to get on how they're
[02:36:42.640 --> 02:36:46.320]  trying to start a war and how they're gonna totally implode the economy soon
[02:36:46.320 --> 02:36:50.240]  but it's also good to get back journals so so tell folks how they get a
[02:36:50.240 --> 02:36:54.840]  subscription to the latest journal but how do they get back journals so they
[02:36:54.840 --> 02:36:59.400]  can really get an understanding of how important your view of the world is
[02:36:59.400 --> 02:37:04.640]  Gerald Solente well our website they could go to trends journal calm and just
[02:37:04.640 --> 02:37:08.760]  request the back trends journals and we sent them to you it's as simple as that
[02:37:08.760 --> 02:37:12.680]  awesome what are some key subscribe what are some key journals from the past
[02:37:12.680 --> 02:37:16.760]  that that that you would recommend for people to order well you know one of
[02:37:16.760 --> 02:37:26.520]  them in 2004 I came out and said that in 2007 we would enter quote the great
[02:37:26.520 --> 02:37:34.320]  recession so we saw it back then and we also saw back in 2001 we knew that
[02:37:34.320 --> 02:37:41.800]  gold prices would go to record highs and we call the bottom at 275 dollars an
[02:37:41.800 --> 02:37:47.840]  ounce it's very simple to see and that was it was by knowing that they would
[02:37:47.840 --> 02:37:53.560]  begin to lower interest rates to 46 year loans so you can't keep printing this
[02:37:53.560 --> 02:37:58.160]  digital money not worth the paper it's not printed on without ruining the
[02:37:58.160 --> 02:38:03.360]  economy and the other ones of course we forecast terrorism back in my book
[02:38:03.360 --> 02:38:10.400]  trends 2000 back in 1997 you could see these trends coming but people are they
[02:38:10.400 --> 02:38:16.000]  want to live in denial Alex but not anymore more and more people want the
[02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:20.640]  truth they want the facts the motto by the way of the trends research
[02:38:20.640 --> 02:38:25.840]  Institute is think for yourself I don't tell people what to believe and nobody
[02:38:25.840 --> 02:38:29.320]  tells me what and that was your dad that taught you think for yourself I mean my
[02:38:29.320 --> 02:38:33.280]  father I mean he almost gave me the same statements about don't be a parent
[02:38:33.280 --> 02:38:37.920]  think for yourself there's an agenda in the media you know our government's
[02:38:37.920 --> 02:38:41.680]  supposed to be small historically governments are destructive now that
[02:38:41.680 --> 02:38:45.840]  scene is extremist by Chris Matthews but that's Thomas Jefferson that's
[02:38:45.840 --> 02:38:51.760]  authentic American you know don't get into debt work hard only trust your
[02:38:51.760 --> 02:38:56.120]  family always stick up for your family that is demonized today but that's what
[02:38:56.120 --> 02:39:00.280]  made this country great I mean who is Chris Matthews what has this guy ever
[02:39:00.280 --> 02:39:07.480]  done was he a PR guy for a congressman or a senator or something yeah before
[02:39:07.480 --> 02:39:11.920]  this I mean they're nothing Tim Russett everybody's to bow down to him
[02:39:11.920 --> 02:39:19.120]  another PR flack that's all they are they're all yes men there's not a man
[02:39:19.120 --> 02:39:27.280]  among them they all work in the Washington Beltway circle jerk none of
[02:39:27.280 --> 02:39:33.880]  them stands up and stands out even this guy Bill Mayer who oh you know he's a
[02:39:33.880 --> 02:39:40.040]  wise guy this or that I remember when he retracted his statement when he said
[02:39:40.040 --> 02:39:45.400]  the one thing you couldn't call the terrorists on 9-11 were cowards they're
[02:39:45.400 --> 02:39:52.880]  cowards the paycheck comes first there's not a man among them there's not a man
[02:39:52.880 --> 02:40:00.080]  in the White House there never has been in my lifetime other than Eisenhower well
[02:40:00.080 --> 02:40:04.640]  I want to get into the war and when you see the the economy imploding in more
[02:40:04.640 --> 02:40:08.840]  detail that's in the current trends forecast journal but but before we do
[02:40:08.840 --> 02:40:12.680]  that we were talking during the break about how Chris Matthews on a best
[02:40:12.680 --> 02:40:17.640]  night has 500,000 viewers and how medium-sized syndicated shows like this
[02:40:17.640 --> 02:40:21.640]  one have millions several million conservatively about a million more each
[02:40:21.640 --> 02:40:25.680]  week only about three million total Chris Matthews is a legend in his own mind
[02:40:25.680 --> 02:40:29.440]  but because there's a teleprompter because there's a fancy suit there's a
[02:40:29.440 --> 02:40:34.440]  bunch of reporters still some people watching it think it has all this
[02:40:34.440 --> 02:40:39.800]  gravitas and authority but that illusion is now dying but Chris Matthews and
[02:40:39.800 --> 02:40:44.800]  others still think their propaganda is working and that's a big deal that whoever
[02:40:44.800 --> 02:40:49.880]  they attack suddenly goes up in the polls I mean don't these delusional
[02:40:49.880 --> 02:40:54.800]  monkeys get and understand that their free ride lying to people in
[02:40:54.800 --> 02:41:01.120]  bamboozling and scamming and hoodwinking is coming to an end not until they get
[02:41:01.120 --> 02:41:05.880]  fired and the ratings keep slipping look what's happened to CNN you know I've
[02:41:05.880 --> 02:41:11.120]  just come up with a new pledge I'm not going on anymore these shows anymore
[02:41:11.120 --> 02:41:14.960]  I'm very selective and if any of them want to do it they could come over to my
[02:41:14.960 --> 02:41:19.240]  place and and they could interview me and they're not gonna edit it we're gonna
[02:41:19.240 --> 02:41:24.200]  do it live because I know the game I've been around a long time when you're in
[02:41:24.200 --> 02:41:29.280]  control of the controls like they are you can make it look like anything so
[02:41:29.280 --> 02:41:35.720]  why should I give my valuable time up to them what have they ever accomplished
[02:41:35.720 --> 02:41:43.200]  what have they ever done their broadcast blowhards and suck ups to the
[02:41:43.200 --> 02:41:49.200]  political system so why should I go on their shows to boost their rating well
[02:41:49.200 --> 02:41:53.640]  yeah that's the headlines down CNN has lost more than half its viewers in one
[02:41:53.640 --> 02:41:57.240]  year they lost half their viewers the year before that I mean they're gonna be
[02:41:57.240 --> 02:42:02.760]  down to 50,000 viewers on their lowest show 200,000 on their biggest if the
[02:42:02.760 --> 02:42:07.080]  trend continues in six months according to the Associated Press their top show
[02:42:07.080 --> 02:42:10.520]  Larry King has a million by the way it's gonna be a hot show tonight I talked to
[02:42:10.520 --> 02:42:14.040]  Ventura a few days ago and I can now talk about he's me on there with Oliver
[02:42:14.040 --> 02:42:18.600]  Stone talking about New World Order so now they're forced to let Ventura and
[02:42:18.600 --> 02:42:22.800]  Stone on who will actually talk about real issues desperately to keep any
[02:42:22.800 --> 02:42:27.360]  viewers so that's actually smart of Larry King you mean Larry is it
[02:42:27.360 --> 02:42:33.200]  Larry King live or Larry King almost dead come on you know it's when are they
[02:42:33.200 --> 02:42:36.800]  gonna try something new they're not gonna do anything they don't want it I
[02:42:36.800 --> 02:42:42.280]  know the inside scoop they want no one with a personality they're they're
[02:42:42.280 --> 02:42:47.720]  white bread through and through it hurts the advertisers let's get to the
[02:42:47.720 --> 02:42:52.560]  bottom line here a guy like me I'm bad for business I'm telling people don't
[02:42:52.560 --> 02:42:57.080]  buy anything you don't need I'm telling people that you're gonna keep buying
[02:42:57.080 --> 02:43:03.960]  stocks in a market like this as they bring out all these shills on CNBC and
[02:43:03.960 --> 02:43:09.280]  other places saying this is a good buying opportunity stocks are at a low
[02:43:09.280 --> 02:43:16.480]  yeah stocks are at a low they were in 1999 low remember they told you Alex you
[02:43:16.480 --> 02:43:23.360]  know you have to stay in it for the long term it wasn't the NASDAQ in 2000 at
[02:43:23.360 --> 02:43:32.280]  5000 and now it's touching 2000 what is the long term a couple of generations
[02:43:32.280 --> 02:43:38.680]  oh and how about those wonderful legacy stocks like Lehman Brothers and General
[02:43:38.680 --> 02:43:43.680]  Motors no they don't want me on I'm not going on anymore I'm telling you I'm
[02:43:43.680 --> 02:43:49.200]  very selective I get I get requests I turn them down I don't need them well
[02:43:49.200 --> 02:43:53.480]  I've noticed I only see you now I need them I notice the YouTube's I see of
[02:43:53.480 --> 02:43:58.440]  of recent because I don't watch TV I didn't watch an aggregate clips I don't
[02:43:58.440 --> 02:44:02.840]  watch a lot of TV to be accurate but I notice I only see you on Fox mainly when
[02:44:02.840 --> 02:44:08.400]  it's live yes exactly won't go on any tape shows because they do what they do
[02:44:08.400 --> 02:44:14.520]  to you they sandbag you you could do anything with editing and again these
[02:44:14.520 --> 02:44:20.520]  aren't men there's not a man among them they're big mouths when they're in their
[02:44:20.520 --> 02:44:26.960]  little power bases just like politicians the red carpet crowd you know they show
[02:44:26.960 --> 02:44:32.880]  up in these huge airplanes you know they salute they walk down the gang plank a
[02:44:32.880 --> 02:44:37.920]  red carpet comes out they strike up the band and they have a parade and they're
[02:44:37.920 --> 02:44:43.360]  there they have all their guards around them and the crowd is you know a hundred
[02:44:43.360 --> 02:44:49.040]  yards away let's talk man-to-man over here you'll never get one of them do it
[02:44:49.040 --> 02:44:55.120]  because they're little babies they're only tough in their own arena if they
[02:44:55.120 --> 02:44:59.200]  want to come over and talk to me man-to-man we could have a man-to-man
[02:44:59.200 --> 02:45:04.320]  conversation they'll never do it there's not a man among them they have
[02:45:04.320 --> 02:45:09.560]  political suck ups all of them well when you have a bunch of cowards running
[02:45:09.560 --> 02:45:13.200]  your society who say yes to everything the worst is going to gravitate to the
[02:45:13.200 --> 02:45:16.600]  top and they're going to become disconnected from reality and they're
[02:45:16.600 --> 02:45:19.760]  going to destroy their own tyranny that's the good news is they've created
[02:45:19.760 --> 02:45:24.520]  such a tsunami of robbing and looting and stealing that Merkel two weeks ago
[02:45:24.520 --> 02:45:29.800]  had to put her own blocks in to stop the the Wall Street and London banks bringing
[02:45:29.800 --> 02:45:34.600]  Germany down and that brings me back to you got cut off by the last break and we
[02:45:34.600 --> 02:45:37.840]  went off into other subject because I went there Gerald you're talking about
[02:45:37.840 --> 02:45:43.520]  war sooner rather than later you're saying you believe the the the full
[02:45:43.520 --> 02:45:49.520]  collapse will come by the end of 2010 give us the full breakdown let's go
[02:45:49.520 --> 02:45:54.380]  through this the crash of 2010 is happening we saw it with the Dow taking a
[02:45:54.380 --> 02:45:59.120]  dive and continue to do so as the rest of the world equity markets the United
[02:45:59.120 --> 02:46:03.880]  States has spent length and guaranteed 13 trillion dollars to bail out this
[02:46:03.880 --> 02:46:08.000]  system including bailing out the commercial real estate sector this has
[02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:14.360]  gone on worldwide the whole EU has done it with their cheap money Australia the
[02:46:14.360 --> 02:46:20.200]  UK Japan South Korea and China of course but China could afford to do it
[02:46:20.200 --> 02:46:25.120]  because they have surpluses it's all running out now so now we're going to
[02:46:25.120 --> 02:46:32.400]  start seeing the collapse that's why gold prices are what now what 1200
[02:46:32.400 --> 02:46:38.520]  about $40 30 that's world record world record Europe world record here and the
[02:46:38.520 --> 02:46:42.680]  Europeans know the deal and they're gonna keep buying more of it then we're
[02:46:42.680 --> 02:46:47.800]  going to see more talk about war and that's how they divert the attention
[02:46:47.800 --> 02:46:52.720]  history is only repeating itself the same thing happened in the late 1920s
[02:46:52.720 --> 02:46:59.400]  markets crash depressions recession set in social unrest builds and what do they
[02:46:59.400 --> 02:47:04.040]  do they take you to war but we have to have nuclear war we have to have nuclear
[02:47:04.040 --> 02:47:07.520]  war I mean what they've told us forget about bin Laden for five years but now
[02:47:07.520 --> 02:47:12.360]  he's in Iran they said so we've got to have nuclear war Gerald bin Laden
[02:47:12.360 --> 02:47:16.480]  and how about that side I'm who's saying remember his weapons the mass
[02:47:16.480 --> 02:47:22.360]  destruction and ties down Cater and remember the Gulf of Tom Kinn remember
[02:47:22.360 --> 02:47:27.360]  the main well but but I was on the main bin Laden was on the main and Havana
[02:47:27.360 --> 02:47:32.720]  Harbor in 1898 Gerald come on there no conspiracy theories yeah you're right
[02:47:32.720 --> 02:47:36.760]  and you know you were talking before we're talking about these whims look at
[02:47:36.760 --> 02:47:42.200]  Obama the cheap trick with him going out there I'm gonna kick ass yeah I was
[02:47:42.200 --> 02:47:47.000]  gonna throw sharp elbows on the word I mean the word on him is is all he does
[02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:50.640]  is hang around in bath houses you know so I mean that this whole thing is a
[02:47:50.640 --> 02:47:56.640]  disgusting spectacle and the people need to realize who's in control remember
[02:47:56.640 --> 02:48:01.360]  the guys in high school and college that wanted to be the class presidents and
[02:48:01.360 --> 02:48:06.960]  the head of the student council the guys that you know a suck ups that were
[02:48:06.960 --> 02:48:13.080]  brown nosers that were never sincere glad-handers and only out for
[02:48:13.080 --> 02:48:18.480]  themselves the people that you couldn't stand no I remember being about 18 and
[02:48:18.480 --> 02:48:22.120]  finally figuring out there's a lot of manipulative liars out there who assess
[02:48:22.120 --> 02:48:25.980]  you like a predator and then manipulate but they're but they're always
[02:48:25.980 --> 02:48:31.400]  cowards you know at their bottom bottom card exactly and these are now our
[02:48:31.400 --> 02:48:38.360]  senators our secretaries of this and that our presidents that's all they are
[02:48:38.360 --> 02:48:44.160]  the same people we couldn't stand in high school in college are now telling us
[02:48:44.160 --> 02:48:49.360]  what to do and the reason they get away with it again it's the red carpet
[02:48:49.360 --> 02:48:54.680]  crowd it's the pump that they keep showing the poll well well I mean you
[02:48:54.680 --> 02:49:00.160]  talk about going into Iran how do you see that unfolding a and then B you did
[02:49:00.160 --> 02:49:05.320]  say the stimulus would run out in 2010 you called it the the OA situation two
[02:49:05.320 --> 02:49:09.160]  three years before you've called that accurately and and then some of the other
[02:49:09.160 --> 02:49:12.600]  great economists we've had on have been accurate so that's what scary is is is
[02:49:12.600 --> 02:49:16.040]  that you know all the experts are agreeing and you can see and now the
[02:49:16.040 --> 02:49:21.080]  mainstream media is finally admitting an implosion is accelerating and so I
[02:49:21.080 --> 02:49:24.880]  mean that I mean you're saying you see this really happening by the end of this
[02:49:24.880 --> 02:49:28.720]  year clearly the economy's already you know on its back like a turtle that can't
[02:49:28.720 --> 02:49:32.440]  get up but but I mean describe that in detail how you see it unfolding all right
[02:49:32.440 --> 02:49:38.120]  first on the war the Iran is talking about now bringing you know the ship
[02:49:38.120 --> 02:49:45.080]  into Gaza of relief goods that could be a conflict right there Israel is on the
[02:49:45.080 --> 02:49:51.680]  edge continually looking for an excuse as is being reported to to invade Iran to
[02:49:51.680 --> 02:49:57.280]  knock out their nuclear capabilities at any level the United States keeps
[02:49:57.280 --> 02:50:03.360]  demonizing Israel Iran continually and so we see something happening and as a
[02:50:03.360 --> 02:50:08.480]  flashpoint that that'll and of course it'll be a false flag we will put no
[02:50:08.480 --> 02:50:12.960]  credence in it at all if there's an attack against Iran that's the worst
[02:50:12.960 --> 02:50:18.400]  scenario and that's the one we think is going to unfold on the economic level
[02:50:18.400 --> 02:50:24.400]  there are a million wild cards out there Europe looks like the best one now but
[02:50:24.400 --> 02:50:30.160]  there could be a huge collapse by the way Alex every every Saturday morning you

[02:54:11.280 --> 02:54:15.480]  one of the key analysts we have in a fall of the republic and the Obama
[02:54:15.480 --> 02:54:20.200]  deception both of these films break down who the globalist are how they set up
[02:54:20.200 --> 02:54:23.440]  the banking scam how they're taking over and what their plan is going to be
[02:54:23.440 --> 02:54:27.200]  into this year in the next so this is kind of a video trends forecast hope
[02:54:27.200 --> 02:54:31.240]  you'll get them both at info wars dot com and the new film we just released
[02:54:31.240 --> 02:54:36.440]  invisible empire a new world order defined so important knowledge is power
[02:54:36.440 --> 02:54:40.400]  and it's also important in these rough times to support the alternative media
[02:54:40.400 --> 02:54:43.840]  that's a separate subject bring up with gerald the next hour the open calls
[02:54:43.840 --> 02:54:48.360]  everywhere to shut down the internet to censor talk radio others to have
[02:54:48.360 --> 02:54:53.600]  government licenses to be a journalist I mean the system is in trouble when they
[02:54:53.600 --> 02:54:56.240]  openly want to shut down free speech but you're also lent a you were getting
[02:54:56.240 --> 02:55:02.600]  into opening the paper up 567 1012 depending on the day every day banks are
[02:55:02.600 --> 02:55:07.160]  being shut down by the federal regulators please continue yes they the
[02:55:07.160 --> 02:55:11.800]  federal reserve is effectively bankrupt and what we're saying is that when
[02:55:11.800 --> 02:55:16.800]  there is a terrorist strike and there will be we're forecasting one of 911
[02:55:16.800 --> 02:55:21.000]  magnitude this time they're going to close the banks the last time they closed
[02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:26.240]  Wall Street but of course the last time in 2001 you know we were getting over
[02:55:26.240 --> 02:55:30.480]  the dot-com bubble bursting and the conditions were very bad but nothing
[02:55:30.480 --> 02:55:35.480]  like today so they were able to lower interest rates back then now they're at
[02:55:35.480 --> 02:55:40.920]  near zero I mean in some day I know they're talking about negative interest
[02:55:40.920 --> 02:55:45.700]  rates but it's not going to work so this time in order to stop the panic we
[02:55:45.700 --> 02:55:49.520]  believe they're going to close the banks but the point being is that the banks
[02:55:49.520 --> 02:55:56.080]  are already in trouble there is not going to be a recovery it does it shows
[02:55:56.080 --> 02:56:01.400]  up in the job numbers and then you have these these analysts are saying well
[02:56:01.400 --> 02:56:07.160]  it's a jobless recovery you have about being almost pregnant as I say you know
[02:56:07.160 --> 02:56:13.000]  there's no such thing you have to create jobs with 72% consumer oriented
[02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:19.480]  society no jobs no consumption and then what we're looking at as I said as when
[02:56:19.480 --> 02:56:26.160]  they can no longer hide the failures they take us to war and the war looks
[02:56:26.160 --> 02:56:32.120]  like it's going to be at this point with Iran and when it does happen we don't
[02:56:32.120 --> 02:56:37.720]  believe the reasons they give us will be real it'll be a false flag as it was
[02:56:37.720 --> 02:56:43.000]  with weapons of mass destruction and ties down K to the Gulf of Tonkin and
[02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:49.440]  others but in the Gulf of Tonkin in 64 Bin Laden was there you know that's
[02:56:49.440 --> 02:56:54.400]  another question why are they getting so arrogant to have the CIA in spy talk in
[02:56:54.400 --> 02:56:58.520]  the Washington Post weekly column admit they put out fake bin Laden videos why
[02:56:58.520 --> 02:57:03.280]  is handlebar mustache Harald Rivera talking to the Marine Corps Colonel
[02:57:03.280 --> 02:57:08.840]  admitting that our government has the troops growing the opium I mean before
[02:57:08.840 --> 02:57:11.920]  they would at least lie more and more they're going yeah we ship the opium out
[02:57:11.920 --> 02:57:15.520]  yeah we're putting fake videos out yeah we won't tell you where the trillions
[02:57:15.520 --> 02:57:18.880]  and bailout money went I mean it looks like they've almost shifted tactics to
[02:57:18.880 --> 02:57:24.360]  just like hiding it in plain view now you know the as I said before you know
[02:57:24.360 --> 02:57:29.120]  these aren't the brightest people they're given too much credit they're
[02:57:29.120 --> 02:57:36.120]  losers again everything they touch they turn to rot whether it's education
[02:57:36.120 --> 02:57:42.160]  health care wars environment you name it food so yeah they're not the brightest
[02:57:42.160 --> 02:57:47.560]  people and look the CIA is admitting that they're waging a war with these
[02:57:47.560 --> 02:57:53.760]  predator drones in Pakistan since when did the CIA get into the war business
[02:57:53.760 --> 02:58:00.160]  overtly and since when is it not against international law to perform
[02:58:00.160 --> 02:58:06.800]  extrajudicial killings by killing quote suspected terrorists in sovereign
[02:58:06.800 --> 02:58:13.760]  countries by sending drones in so it's their arrogance and also possibly their
[02:58:13.760 --> 02:58:20.720]  ignorance well Gerald Solente the trends research analyst the founder of

[03:00:06.360 --> 03:00:10.920]  Wow Gerald Salente saying he thinks they're probably gonna stage an attack
[03:00:10.920 --> 03:00:16.560]  of some type as a false flag to go into Iran these are the times that try folks
[03:00:16.560 --> 03:00:22.240]  souls this is real this is happening and I catch myself all the time just kind of
[03:00:22.240 --> 03:00:25.360]  getting comfortable with the idea of depression comfortable with the idea of
[03:00:25.360 --> 03:00:30.440]  World War three no we need to get angry we need to get upset we need to get
[03:00:30.440 --> 03:00:35.320]  involved and and and Gerald Salente I I want to take some calls but when we come
[03:00:35.320 --> 03:00:38.760]  back in the next segment I want to hear your idea for solutions 9th 10th
[03:00:38.760 --> 03:00:42.800]  amendment you know we know where the globalists are going but how you see the
[03:00:42.800 --> 03:00:47.720]  Tea Party movement unfolding into the wider Second American Revolution 1776
[03:00:47.720 --> 03:00:51.880]  all over again so that's coming up with Gerald Salente of Trends Research
[03:00:51.880 --> 03:00:57.800]  Journal but let's go to Chris in Indiana first question for Gerald Salente go
[03:00:57.800 --> 03:01:04.320]  ahead Chris. Gerald Alex thank you for taking my call. Question is with the oil
[03:01:04.320 --> 03:01:09.200]  volcano going on in the Gulf of Mexico right now I read an article this morning
[03:01:09.200 --> 03:01:14.680]  where the PSI coming out of that hole could be 20,000 PSI or greater and they
[03:01:14.680 --> 03:01:20.720]  may not be able to cap it can that event being very catastrophic with the
[03:01:20.720 --> 03:01:25.040]  toxins you know the fishing industry getting you destroyed the tourism can
[03:01:25.040 --> 03:01:30.240]  that event cause the collapse to happen earlier rather than later in your six
[03:01:30.240 --> 03:01:36.120]  month prediction? Probably not it's a terrible event but there are much
[03:01:36.120 --> 03:01:43.080]  bigger economic issues around it but the other part of that is that to get the
[03:01:43.080 --> 03:01:50.240]  people's mind off that war will do that. I agree I agree they're using the oil as a
[03:01:50.240 --> 03:01:54.480]  nice distraction while they're getting their war ready. And it would go back to
[03:01:54.480 --> 03:02:01.160]  when the oil spill first began and then we saw that Times Square bomber pop up
[03:02:01.160 --> 03:02:07.280]  and the oil went out of the media and that's what can happen again so if
[03:02:07.280 --> 03:02:11.840]  there's a terrorist strike or a war and something of that nature this thing will
[03:02:11.840 --> 03:02:16.680]  be flushed out of the news very quickly. Yeah they decide but but the more and
[03:02:16.680 --> 03:02:19.280]  more they're losing control of the media and we'll talk about their attempt at
[03:02:19.280 --> 03:02:23.880]  media censorship later but look at Haiti 200,000 plus dead thousands I've seen
[03:02:23.880 --> 03:02:28.120]  numbers thousands dying a week the total collapse of society you don't hear
[03:02:28.120 --> 03:02:34.720]  about Haiti anymore. No no you don't and and again this tragedy that's going on
[03:02:34.720 --> 03:02:39.800]  in the Gulf it looks like it is it's going to continue going on and the
[03:02:39.800 --> 03:02:44.360]  implications are exactly what the call has said are very far-reaching whether
[03:02:44.360 --> 03:02:49.240]  it's the the feed supplies you know with that the fish just keeps going on and
[03:02:49.240 --> 03:02:55.240]  on. The fish the oysters most of our seafood oysters and shrimp and is
[03:02:55.240 --> 03:02:59.120]  coming out of the Gulf I mean the terrorism I mean this is going to
[03:02:59.120 --> 03:03:04.360]  decimate Florida and Louisiana and Mississippi and then they they show the
[03:03:04.360 --> 03:03:08.200]  tidal forces it's it's going to go around Florida and up the east coast and
[03:03:08.200 --> 03:03:13.040]  meanwhile the feds are so tightly controlling this now we're talking about
[03:03:13.040 --> 03:03:17.640]  using nuclear weapons to stop it I mean this is insane. Yeah oh the other part
[03:03:17.640 --> 03:03:21.840]  of the food chain is you know the fish meal and all the all the residue from
[03:03:21.840 --> 03:03:28.000]  the fish that are used for you know for feeds and for fertilizers so this thing
[03:03:28.000 --> 03:03:33.160]  just keeps going on and on but again they're going to we believe there's
[03:03:33.160 --> 03:03:38.880]  going to be a terror a 9-11 magnitude terror strike before this year is over
[03:03:38.880 --> 03:03:45.200]  and that the concept of war will become more and more of a given as we get
[03:03:45.200 --> 03:03:51.800]  closer to financial disaster and again just turn on the news look what's going
[03:03:51.800 --> 03:03:56.080]  on with the world equity markets regardless of all this baloney you
[03:03:56.080 --> 03:04:00.840]  hearing about being a good buying opportunity and profit margins are still
[03:04:00.840 --> 03:04:06.800]  very high the collapse is coming. Well said we're going to come back and go to
[03:04:06.800 --> 03:04:12.760]  Pete and Calgary, Alberta, Mark and Oregon, Mark and California, Greg and
[03:04:12.760 --> 03:04:18.360]  Kansas and others. The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231. We got
[03:04:18.360 --> 03:04:22.240]  only at about 45 seconds but what about media censorship Gerald we're really
[03:04:22.240 --> 03:04:26.200]  seeing him start to hype that it's the American way is to shut down free speech.
[03:04:26.200 --> 03:04:32.040]  Well we heard President Obama say that in so many words when he warned about all
[03:04:32.040 --> 03:04:36.720]  these other voices out there that you have to be careful about because you're
[03:04:36.720 --> 03:04:41.880]  getting them over the internet and on and not from the mainstream media as
[03:04:41.880 --> 03:04:46.560]  though they're the ones that you should believe. Absolutely stay there let's
[03:04:46.560 --> 03:04:50.240]  finish up talking about the attempt at media censorship that's being promoted
[03:04:50.240 --> 03:04:53.840]  right now and then we'll go to your calls and a lot more but Gerald Salente
[03:04:53.840 --> 03:04:58.920]  9-11 magnitude attack sometime in the next six to seven months we'll be right
[03:04:58.920 --> 03:05:04.200]  back stay with us. Hello this is Alex Jones with some important questions if

[03:06:59.280 --> 03:07:03.280]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[03:07:03.280 --> 03:07:07.640]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[03:07:07.640 --> 03:07:11.800]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[03:07:11.800 --> 03:07:15.840]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[03:07:15.840 --> 03:07:19.720]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[03:07:19.720 --> 03:07:24.000]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[03:07:24.000 --> 03:07:28.160]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[03:07:28.160 --> 03:07:32.480]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[03:07:32.480 --> 03:07:36.160]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages number
[03:07:36.160 --> 03:07:40.360]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[03:07:40.360 --> 03:07:43.760]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions
[03:07:43.760 --> 03:07:49.920]  from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[03:07:49.920 --> 03:07:53.880]  that's my solar back up dot com remember the government doesn't own the sun
[03:07:53.880 --> 03:08:06.840]  so go to my solar back up dot com or call 1-877-327-0365 oh yeah big brother
[03:08:06.840 --> 03:08:14.160]  mainstream media government cover our number four answers well so does he he's
[03:08:14.160 --> 03:08:23.400]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[03:08:23.400 --> 03:08:28.280]  trends research one word trends research comms the invaluable trends
[03:08:28.280 --> 03:08:33.280]  research Institute website and Gerald Salentes with us until the bottom of the
[03:08:33.280 --> 03:08:38.160]  hour going to your phone calls think of how un-American it is that they have
[03:08:38.160 --> 03:08:44.720]  neocon from and they have White House officials cast Sunstein Elena Kagan in
[03:08:44.720 --> 03:08:48.200]  her papers which they've now declared basically national security on her
[03:08:48.200 --> 03:08:52.320]  trying to block the full release of but the ones we have she's saying no second
[03:08:52.320 --> 03:08:56.760]  amendment no free speech the state can restrict whatever speech it wants if it's
[03:08:56.760 --> 03:09:01.240]  in the best interest of the state sounds like Stalin we are the state where the
[03:09:01.240 --> 03:09:05.880]  people first amendment open talk of taking over talk radio the internet the
[03:09:05.880 --> 03:09:12.600]  FTC in the news saying we want to fund mainline newspapers and TV with taxes on
[03:09:12.600 --> 03:09:18.080]  the internet and iPhones Gerald Salentes I mean this is an amazing development
[03:09:18.080 --> 03:09:21.600]  they finally realized they've lost all credibility so now they're everywhere
[03:09:21.600 --> 03:09:26.360]  sending up trial balloons telling us how American it is to ban our free speech I
[03:09:26.360 --> 03:09:32.400]  mean this is this is this is tyranny as they keep losing more and more control
[03:09:32.400 --> 03:09:37.240]  they will exert more and more control that's what's going on they know they're
[03:09:37.240 --> 03:09:44.000]  losing it as I said and I will say it again the merger of state and corporate
[03:09:44.000 --> 03:09:49.880]  powers just as you pointed out by giving our tax payer money to whether it's the
[03:09:49.880 --> 03:09:56.700]  media or the banks or the too big to fails is called fascism and fascism
[03:09:56.700 --> 03:10:03.360]  has come to America they will do anything they can to stop their loss of
[03:10:03.360 --> 03:10:08.920]  power and they're losing it by the seconds well it's a criminal buy-off
[03:10:08.920 --> 03:10:13.320]  it's a I mean remembering Congress and hearings just last year it came out of
[03:10:13.320 --> 03:10:16.840]  the Democratic Party when looked at records and if your Chevy dealership
[03:10:16.840 --> 03:10:20.880]  one of them was set up in like 1916 in Minnesota in one case was on the news if
[03:10:20.880 --> 03:10:25.160]  you hadn't given money to the Democrats and you were a Republican to show the
[03:10:25.160 --> 03:10:30.440]  infighting they the government took your dealership literally in one case worth
[03:10:30.440 --> 03:10:34.440]  tens of millions of dollars and gave it to a Democrat contributor I mean this is
[03:10:34.440 --> 03:10:39.440]  Chicago mob and now it's coming out that the White House chief of staff who we
[03:10:39.440 --> 03:10:44.000]  notice is laying low on a manual that this guy for years as a congressman had
[03:10:44.000 --> 03:10:48.880]  a donor paying for his house in DC I mean ten years ago you went to prison for
[03:10:48.880 --> 03:10:53.800]  that now they just say hey we're the we're we're gangsters yeah the only
[03:10:53.800 --> 03:10:59.120]  people that go to prison in too hard time are we the people the word justice is
[03:10:59.120 --> 03:11:10.880]  misspelled is J U S T U S just us not them the game is rigged again it's
[03:11:10.880 --> 03:11:16.600]  Harvard Princeton Yale you mentioned Kagan what am I a moron that the whole
[03:11:16.600 --> 03:11:22.400]  Supreme Court is stacked with Harvard and Yale the the head of the Fed is from
[03:11:22.400 --> 03:11:30.360]  Princeton they're all better than we are just us not them we're the only ones
[03:11:30.360 --> 03:11:36.920]  that pay the fines that get hit by the tax collectors you go you go through you
[03:11:36.920 --> 03:11:42.680]  have two drinks two glasses of wine and they they breathalyze you know if they if
[03:11:42.680 --> 03:11:50.560]  you're a half of a meter over it they'll hand coffee and throw in jail well
[03:11:50.560 --> 03:11:52.960]  here's an article right here you know I mentioned this and we're going back to
[03:11:52.960 --> 03:11:57.360]  calls but the start of the show Amish farming draws rare government
[03:11:57.360 --> 03:12:01.240]  scrutiny and it says you would think with their simplistic living they'd be
[03:12:01.240 --> 03:12:08.120]  good but no the cows defecating is seen as pollution now and it and it goes on
[03:12:08.120 --> 03:12:11.440]  to admit that the feds don't even go inspect big giant dirty Tyson's
[03:12:11.440 --> 03:12:16.320]  facilities but now they're harassing the little Amish I see reports every week
[03:12:16.320 --> 03:12:20.320]  with their arresting people selling eggs and watermelons on the side of the road
[03:12:20.320 --> 03:12:25.640]  with SWAT teams they're sending SWAT teams to little farmers houses who get
[03:12:25.640 --> 03:12:30.680]  caught selling watermelons I mean this is the most criminal out of I saw an
[03:12:30.680 --> 03:12:37.240]  article last year where a city council in Oklahoma is trying to pass a law that
[03:12:37.240 --> 03:12:40.280]  you have to have a license to have a garden I mean I mean these people are
[03:12:40.280 --> 03:12:46.360]  crooks what's happening Alex is the agricultural industry is understanding
[03:12:46.360 --> 03:12:52.160]  that a lot of people are buying factory of family farm food and buying local it's
[03:12:52.160 --> 03:12:59.040]  eroding their profit margins by the way as we saw with this oil spill disaster
[03:12:59.040 --> 03:13:03.960]  and we continue to see they call it a revolving door people from business
[03:13:03.960 --> 03:13:08.360]  going into government and government going into business it's not a revolving
[03:13:08.360 --> 03:13:15.080]  door it's a wide open door and it's run by the big corporations it's not
[03:13:15.080 --> 03:13:21.200]  revolving so anytime they see a loss going on they're gonna clamp down they
[03:13:21.200 --> 03:13:25.880]  have the goon squads to do it they're gonna clamp down on the little people
[03:13:25.880 --> 03:13:33.760]  that's why the second American Revolution is underway it's incredible
[03:13:33.760 --> 03:13:39.160]  let's go ahead and take another call here Pete in Alberta Canada you're on
[03:13:39.160 --> 03:13:45.880]  the air thanks gentlemen some of the other cosmic forecasters like Arch
[03:13:45.880 --> 03:13:49.840]  Crawford and Cliff high seem to feel strongly that the collapse is gonna
[03:13:49.840 --> 03:13:54.760]  start in July and I'm just wondering two things if you might make your best guess
[03:13:54.760 --> 03:14:00.520]  on what the trigger event might be and then whether the Eurasian Alliance is
[03:14:00.520 --> 03:14:04.760]  actually standing up against the Anglo-American Empire or if they're just
[03:14:04.760 --> 03:14:09.560]  waiting to join yeah is there a real split between Russia China and the
[03:14:09.560 --> 03:14:15.320]  Western powers and what do you see as a trigger for the total collapse the as
[03:14:15.320 --> 03:14:19.000]  far as the alliance goes it's all about money whoever cuts the best deal are
[03:14:19.000 --> 03:14:22.160]  gonna do business with each other they'll fight whoever they want if the
[03:14:22.160 --> 03:14:26.760]  money it's all about money so that that's the name of that game China's only
[03:14:26.760 --> 03:14:31.360]  interested in getting money and and so the Russians and so the Americans they
[03:14:31.360 --> 03:14:37.720]  use democracy and and and human rights those are phony issues what can be the
[03:14:37.720 --> 03:14:42.280]  trigger we believe it's going to be a currency trigger that's our best guess
[03:14:42.280 --> 03:14:48.440]  whether it's the collapse of the euro gold prices eye-rocketing could be one
[03:14:48.440 --> 03:14:51.280]  of the true that's in the New York Times today they're admitting that gold
[03:14:51.280 --> 03:14:57.600]  going up is is exposing derivatives and fake instruments of the central banks I
[03:14:57.600 --> 03:15:04.080]  mean it's it's it's like holy water to count Dracula exactly so that's what we
[03:15:04.080 --> 03:15:10.200]  see it as mostly a financial crisis in terms of currencies and defaults on
[03:15:10.200 --> 03:15:16.160]  bonds and and by the way why these people so angry in Europe about paying the
[03:15:16.160 --> 03:15:21.320]  bondholders who are the bondholders if a country goes default in the big banks
[03:15:21.320 --> 03:15:26.240]  that's the one that's right the taxpayer money goes into the country a hundred
[03:15:26.240 --> 03:15:29.920]  percent I mean literally in many cases a hundred percent goes back up to the
[03:15:29.920 --> 03:15:34.880]  banks and then the banks take the country's triple a rating away because
[03:15:34.880 --> 03:15:39.800]  they had to bail the banks out and the banks loan the money back to the country
[03:15:39.800 --> 03:15:45.120]  again you know it's the same club in control it's all about money that's why
[03:15:45.120 --> 03:15:49.880]  I said whatever the alliances are going to be it's only about money whatever the
[03:15:49.880 --> 03:15:53.880]  best deal is well from what I've studied it's China the U.S. and Europe are
[03:15:53.880 --> 03:15:57.800]  teamed up and Russia knows it's the odd man out and I'm not saying Russia isn't
[03:15:57.800 --> 03:16:01.400]  corrupt all these governments are but Russia is the wild card for my break
[03:16:01.400 --> 03:16:05.800]  down Gerald what's your take on that that's that's pretty fair but again you
[03:16:05.800 --> 03:16:10.440]  know the Chinese are gonna go they'll go anywhere and if they're not doing enough
[03:16:10.440 --> 03:16:13.640]  trade they'll go where they get the most trade look how they're moving into
[03:16:13.640 --> 03:16:17.320]  Africa now and buying up so much absolutely they're taking over
[03:16:17.320 --> 03:16:21.520]  everywhere let's go ahead and talk to Mark in Oregon you're on the air with
[03:16:21.520 --> 03:16:27.400]  Gerald Salante good afternoon Alex and Gerald great to speak with you I have a
[03:16:27.400 --> 03:16:33.680]  very quick comment and a question go go good go and that is I think I figured
[03:16:33.680 --> 03:16:37.960]  out why Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants are hiding over in Iraq I
[03:16:37.960 --> 03:16:42.680]  think they're tired of being killed don't you think they've died two or three
[03:16:42.680 --> 03:16:48.600]  times already and I'd want to hide too I think I'd get tired tiresome after the
[03:16:48.600 --> 03:16:56.480]  first time but AC Griffith Alex and Gerald who's a former NSA CIA worker he's
[03:16:56.480 --> 03:17:02.760]  reported over the last week that FEMA is amassing the infrastructure to
[03:17:02.760 --> 03:17:09.240]  displace or evacuate some 40 million people from the Gulf area as well as the
[03:17:09.240 --> 03:17:14.880]  East Coast is this oil oil disaster makes its way up the East Coast and he also
[03:17:14.880 --> 03:17:20.680]  reported according to his information on a scientific level that it will drift
[03:17:20.680 --> 03:17:25.160]  over the Atlantic Ocean this this oil contamination of course which is really
[03:17:25.160 --> 03:17:29.840]  a dispersant contamination isolating the benzene which is very dangerous for
[03:17:29.840 --> 03:17:33.440]  health sure all the way to Europe and then eventually around the world that's
[03:17:33.440 --> 03:17:36.400]  what the that's what the current show from satellite let me let me get
[03:17:36.400 --> 03:17:42.000]  Gerald Salante's take on this well yeah I mean I I agree and it could be a huge
[03:17:42.000 --> 03:17:45.840]  disaster and there may be a huge displacement of people I mean this is
[03:17:45.840 --> 03:17:51.000]  this is this you know this is kind of this kind of fits into those prophecy
[03:17:51.000 --> 03:17:57.120]  things that have been made about 2012 when you saw the volcano the last time
[03:17:57.120 --> 03:18:00.680]  they had a big volcano was a French Revolution the last time an Icelandic
[03:18:00.680 --> 03:18:07.440]  volcano did this yeah sorry go ahead you're making your point no no that's
[03:18:07.440 --> 03:18:12.320]  that that's that is the point the point is that we're going to see one catastrophe
[03:18:12.320 --> 03:18:17.440]  after another whether it's man-made natural disaster financial
[03:18:17.440 --> 03:18:22.160]  environmental it's all collapsing on its own and we've noticed historically for
[03:18:22.160 --> 03:18:27.440]  some reason that for some reason natural disasters seem to follow times of
[03:18:27.440 --> 03:18:32.440]  implosion as well it's like my grant on its own momentum there are so many other
[03:18:32.440 --> 03:18:38.120]  forces that we don't know about that are interacting to cause a confluence that
[03:18:38.120 --> 03:18:43.720]  we're looking at now that's why we're saying that 2010 is the breaking year
[03:18:43.720 --> 03:18:47.480]  well my grandfather told my dad he wouldn't tell many war stories about
[03:18:47.480 --> 03:18:54.120]  landing in Italy while Vesuvius was exploding while they were being shot at
[03:18:54.120 --> 03:18:58.200]  because he was in the Army Air Corps but they were leaving North Africa and
[03:18:58.200 --> 03:19:01.120]  actually landing them in the landings with the Germans shooting at him with
[03:19:01.120 --> 03:19:05.560]  Vesuvius exploding and it's just weird how all that stuff seems to run
[03:19:05.560 --> 03:19:11.000]  together it's it's strange isn't it yes it is amazing Gerald Salentes our guest
[03:19:11.000 --> 03:19:14.440]  let's jam in one more before we go to break mark in California you're on the
[03:19:14.440 --> 03:19:20.440]  air go ahead hey thanks for thanks for taking my question my question revolves
[03:19:20.440 --> 03:19:25.960]  around the United Nations law of the sea treaty and I'm wondering how the golf
[03:19:25.960 --> 03:19:30.720]  spill will impact the ongoing debate in Congress and I'll take my answer off there
[03:19:30.720 --> 03:19:36.200]  thanks guys I'm sorry I didn't hear that yes say that again I'm wondering how the
[03:19:36.200 --> 03:19:41.320]  law of the sea treaty debate is law of the sea treaty moving through to turn
[03:19:41.320 --> 03:19:45.160]  the oceans over to the UN which they'll then turn into a giant taxing grid
[03:19:45.160 --> 03:19:50.600]  Gerald Salente is our guest we'll be right back with him here in just a
[03:19:50.600 --> 03:19:54.480]  moment trendsresearch.com is the website he is the leading trends
[03:19:54.480 --> 03:19:58.480]  forecaster in the world and we're very honored that he spent so much time with
[03:19:58.480 --> 03:20:05.040]  us I'm Alex Jones. They helped to create a new world order we are part of a new
[03:20:05.040 --> 03:20:10.720]  world order a new world order based upon collective action. Invisible Empire is a

[03:20:14.120 --> 03:20:17.880]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of
[03:20:17.880 --> 03:20:22.440]  possibilities. It means all the world under their control. The United Nations
[03:20:22.440 --> 03:20:26.680]  would take over America the trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:20:26.680 --> 03:20:31.120]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in
[03:20:31.120 --> 03:20:35.360]  stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government. I believe
[03:20:35.360 --> 03:20:39.240]  first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the
[03:20:39.240 --> 03:20:43.160]  global financial system. Global governance with the establishment of a G20.
[03:20:43.160 --> 03:20:47.720]  So it's gonna be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else and I got news for

[03:22:00.560 --> 03:22:04.840]  Hello this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going
[03:22:04.840 --> 03:22:09.040]  into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you
[03:22:09.040 --> 03:22:13.880]  want? My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of
[03:22:13.880 --> 03:22:18.200]  your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do
[03:22:18.200 --> 03:22:22.560]  you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it? Can you buy
[03:22:22.560 --> 03:22:26.160]  it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your
[03:22:26.160 --> 03:22:30.040]  children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go
[03:22:30.040 --> 03:22:34.320]  to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you
[03:22:34.320 --> 03:22:38.880]  have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and
[03:22:38.880 --> 03:22:43.480]  your life. How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can
[03:22:43.480 --> 03:22:47.680]  get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[03:24:01.160 --> 03:24:09.960]  Well, the time goes by very quick when Gerald Solente is our guest. We appreciate
[03:24:09.960 --> 03:24:13.760]  him joining us at least once a month. I twist his arm to come on more often because
[03:24:13.760 --> 03:24:17.800]  as things get more and more hectic, as the quickening accelerates, he's an
[03:24:17.800 --> 03:24:25.400]  invaluable source of information. Let's go ahead and go back to your phone calls.
[03:24:25.400 --> 03:24:33.240]  Up next is Greg in Kansas. Greg, you're on the air. Go ahead. Yes, Alex. I can get
[03:24:33.240 --> 03:24:39.880]  straight to my question. Yes. Mr. Solente, could a possible way to mitigate the
[03:24:39.880 --> 03:24:45.040]  economic downturn be for communities who have their own currencies focused
[03:24:45.040 --> 03:24:51.760]  around silver? You know, it's too complicated and it's as I keep hearing
[03:24:51.760 --> 03:24:56.680]  about these communities trying to do that. That's not really the issue. The
[03:24:56.680 --> 03:25:03.880]  issue is we need a productive capacity. We have to make things with 300 million
[03:25:03.880 --> 03:25:10.600]  people strong and they put it in our minds that we are unable to manufacture
[03:25:10.600 --> 03:25:15.880]  and do business with each other. Plus, humans aren't happy unless they're
[03:25:15.880 --> 03:25:20.480]  digging in the dirt or working on things or hammering nails. We're meant to build
[03:25:20.480 --> 03:25:24.920]  things. We're meant to pick apples. We're meant to pick figs. We're meant to be out
[03:25:24.920 --> 03:25:30.480]  getting chicken eggs. We're supposed to be out there working. Exactly. We've gone
[03:25:30.480 --> 03:25:37.320]  from a nation of craftsmen and manufacturers to clerks and cashiers.
[03:25:37.320 --> 03:25:45.600]  Think of the word service sector. Try servitude. How about surf? Does
[03:25:45.600 --> 03:25:51.280]  a servant fit in well? That's what they've done to this country. So the productive
[03:25:51.280 --> 03:25:57.280]  capacity that we see, once again, current events form future trends. We have this
[03:25:57.280 --> 03:26:04.080]  atrocity going on in the Gulf of Mexico. How about a real alternative energy? We
[03:26:04.080 --> 03:26:13.280]  spent $22 billion in today's currency to develop the atom bomb and build Los
[03:26:13.280 --> 03:26:20.360]  Alamos. If they were putting the energy and intelligence into having an
[03:26:20.360 --> 03:26:24.640]  alternative energy, that could be the... Well, Gerald, it's like Raiders of the
[03:26:24.640 --> 03:26:29.160]  Lost Ark, as you know. They've got warehouses full of it. I, MIT, a decade
[03:26:29.160 --> 03:26:33.200]  ago, developed a type of cheap solar panel that's just metal that could
[03:26:33.200 --> 03:26:38.520]  produce enough power to power every home you name it. And the World Bank bought
[03:26:38.520 --> 03:26:42.560]  it, even though taxpayers paid for it and isn't letting anybody have it. It is a
[03:26:42.560 --> 03:26:49.480]  fact they are suppressing, as you know, just the Valhalla of energy, because they
[03:26:49.480 --> 03:26:54.560]  want us dependent on them. Exactly. And the other point is, look what got us out
[03:26:54.560 --> 03:27:00.560]  of the 1990s recession. It's simple. It was a productive capacity. The
[03:27:00.560 --> 03:27:05.280]  internet revolution. I mean, here we are on Skype. Look at how the world changed
[03:27:05.280 --> 03:27:11.840]  since the mid-1990s. Products were invented, designed, manufactured. And now
[03:27:11.840 --> 03:27:15.880]  with cybersecurity, they say every IT person will be government certified. The
[03:27:15.880 --> 03:27:19.800]  entire internet and all computers will be under government certification for
[03:27:19.800 --> 03:27:23.480]  what you can build. They're creating a new dark age there. They've taken over
[03:27:23.480 --> 03:27:26.920]  healthcare. They're taking over the ranches, the farms. They're taking over
[03:27:26.920 --> 03:27:31.920]  the Amish. These people are a bunch of crooks. No, they're not. They're fascists.
[03:27:31.920 --> 03:27:37.120]  They're fascist crooks. No, I agree with you. It's just unspeakable. Let's jam in
[03:27:37.120 --> 03:27:41.960]  one more call. This is just incredible. George in Connecticut, you're on the air.
[03:27:41.960 --> 03:27:48.600]  Hi, Gerald. I think an idea I've had. Why don't we have a simulcast with all of the
[03:27:48.600 --> 03:27:54.680]  free thinkers like Alex and Gary Know that you've been on. The big, the
[03:27:54.680 --> 03:27:59.800]  guys that are growing in audience and that also have an idea. Can you also give
[03:27:59.800 --> 03:28:05.120]  us the best battle plans to bring down these bankers and basically short
[03:28:05.120 --> 03:28:08.720]  circuit this possible war they want? Well, I'll tell you what I'm going to do because we're almost out of time.
[03:28:08.720 --> 03:28:12.800]  Gerald, I know I'm twisting your arm here, but can we go to break and come back
[03:28:12.800 --> 03:28:15.920]  with just five minutes without calls so you can cover solutions? Because I keep
[03:28:15.920 --> 03:28:20.400]  getting emails and calls off air saying solutions. Sure. Okay, great. Let's jam in
[03:28:20.400 --> 03:28:22.760]  one more call before we go to break and we'll come back with five minutes of
[03:28:22.760 --> 03:28:26.480]  solutions and I'm getting into other news here because we've got to let Gerald
[03:28:26.480 --> 03:28:33.360]  go. He's got work to do. Let's go ahead and talk to Dan in Alberta. Dan, you're on
[03:28:33.360 --> 03:28:39.160]  the air. Hey, I'd just like to ask Gerald what he thinks about BP and Goldman Sachs
[03:28:39.160 --> 03:28:42.960]  selling their shares during the slower part of the year and also if he thinks
[03:28:42.960 --> 03:28:47.320]  this Guantanamo Bay will finally be moved if Cuba is covered in oil. And
[03:28:47.320 --> 03:28:52.720]  thanks for taking my call. You know, that BP issue is very, very significant and
[03:28:52.720 --> 03:28:57.400]  you know, I don't believe this guy Tony Hay were the president that that little
[03:28:57.400 --> 03:29:05.560]  slimy cat out there had sold a couple of hundred thousand shares just before all
[03:29:05.560 --> 03:29:10.720]  this. He sold 35% of his stock days before Goldman Sachs sold 44% of his
[03:29:10.720 --> 03:29:15.720]  record sale. It's still quite incidental. Nobody's that great a speculator. And the
[03:29:15.720 --> 03:29:20.880]  other, I mean, did you hear this guy? BP will make it right, will fix it. Who are
[03:29:20.880 --> 03:29:25.400]  they kidding with this stuff? No, it's an inside job at some level. It's all an
[03:29:25.400 --> 03:29:29.680]  inside job. The only way you make hundreds of millions of dollars is being
[03:29:29.680 --> 03:29:34.840]  on an inside and knowing how the game is rigged. So that's the way I say. Well,
[03:29:34.840 --> 03:29:40.280]  well said. Absolutely. I mean, the way they want anybody to fix it. Obama wants
[03:29:40.280 --> 03:29:45.080]  to get his carbon tax now and saying, oh, it's a tax to clean up the gulf. Total
[03:29:45.080 --> 03:29:48.360]  baloney. We'll be back with Gerald Salante to get some final solution points
[03:29:48.360 --> 03:29:56.120]  from him. Stay with us. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones
[03:29:56.120 --> 03:30:03.120]  and the GCN radio network. Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones asking you for a minute
[03:30:03.120 --> 03:30:06.960]  of your time to tell you about soap, not detergents, but good old fashioned pure

[03:30:10.680 --> 03:30:15.320]  company. My family, staff, friends and radio listeners are constantly telling me
[03:30:15.320 --> 03:30:19.000]  how much they love these products for bath, air, laundry and dishes. There is
[03:30:19.000 --> 03:30:22.760]  nothing like these factory direct big money saving triple concentrated soaps

[03:31:04.600 --> 03:31:09.880]  The tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality. It
[03:31:09.880 --> 03:31:14.760]  really says that the state is God. The United States is now recognized globally
[03:31:14.760 --> 03:31:19.200]  as one of the most oppressive police states on earth. This film conclusively
[03:31:19.200 --> 03:31:23.520]  proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded
[03:31:23.520 --> 03:31:27.880]  nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program
[03:31:27.880 --> 03:31:32.120]  has established an old powerful shadow state. Police State 4 chronicles the
[03:31:32.120 --> 03:31:36.480]  sickening depths to which our republic has fallen. Prepare to enter the secret

[03:31:46.400 --> 03:31:51.120]  New World Order's hellish plan. The police state isn't coming. It's here.

[03:33:03.800 --> 03:33:07.960]  All right it's our final segment with our guest. I'll continue with calls and
[03:33:07.960 --> 03:33:12.160]  other news to the end of the broadcast. It's only AM and FM dial XM Global
[03:33:12.160 --> 03:33:16.320]  Shortwave and other satellite systems but I'm gonna do at least 20-30 minutes
[03:33:16.320 --> 03:33:21.880]  into overdrive today on several key subjects like MSNBC hit piece, Smears
[03:33:21.880 --> 03:33:27.400]  Tea Party as neo-Nazis and how that dovetails with the Washington Post, the
[03:33:27.400 --> 03:33:34.320]  New York Times, Atlantic Monthly and at least three other publications yesterday
[03:33:34.320 --> 03:33:41.040]  that came out and basically demonized me and implied that I'm dangerous. We never
[03:33:41.040 --> 03:33:45.000]  talk about violence, we never talk about killing people unless it's in self-defense.
[03:33:45.000 --> 03:33:48.680]  You know I say if somebody breaks in my house you better, you know, get ready to
[03:33:48.680 --> 03:33:53.080]  die, you know, with some crook or whatever and they are just, they are
[03:33:53.080 --> 03:33:55.960]  coming after me big time and and believe me a lot of people like man that's
[03:33:55.960 --> 03:34:00.360]  great, that's great for your ego. No, no, it's not great okay. What's great is
[03:34:00.360 --> 03:34:05.160]  beating these people. I'm doing this because I don't want to be a slave. I'm
[03:34:05.160 --> 03:34:10.640]  fundamentally angry about being enslaved okay folks. This isn't about being a
[03:34:10.640 --> 03:34:15.320]  little media whore okay. This is dangerous for what we're doing and Gerald Solente
[03:34:15.320 --> 03:34:20.240]  has got a lot of courage as well and Gerald again they're really taking the
[03:34:20.240 --> 03:34:25.040]  gloves off. What do you expect them to try against us in the future A and then
[03:34:25.040 --> 03:34:29.840]  B, what are some basic solutions to not just protect ourselves individually but
[03:34:29.840 --> 03:34:33.480]  turn the tables on them and take things back at the state level. How do you
[03:34:33.480 --> 03:34:37.520]  expect the Tea Parties as you said three years ago that you predicted you have a
[03:34:37.520 --> 03:34:41.840]  second American Revolution, you called them tax protest groups, how do you see
[03:34:41.840 --> 03:34:46.520]  them morphing to the next level that you've predicted? Alright on the first
[03:34:46.520 --> 03:34:51.000]  level there when they lose control they attack and that's what the media is
[03:34:51.000 --> 03:34:55.920]  doing. People are reading less and less of those publications and watching less
[03:34:55.920 --> 03:35:00.440]  of those news broadcasts that you mentioned. So anytime you know they're
[03:35:00.440 --> 03:35:04.760]  gonna do anything they can to discredit those and aren't members of the club. The
[03:35:04.760 --> 03:35:09.560]  Tea Parties are only the first step and we see it going into something greater
[03:35:09.560 --> 03:35:14.680]  and more inclusive. They will demonize anything they possibly can but it'll be
[03:35:14.680 --> 03:35:21.000]  unsuccessful in the long term. Again you pointed out as we saw Sarah Palin as
[03:35:21.000 --> 03:35:26.440]  put her imprimata on it and others these talk show hosts so they're trying to
[03:35:26.440 --> 03:35:30.520]  hijack the Tea Party so therefore they're trying to demonize it in some
[03:35:30.520 --> 03:35:37.320]  levels but that's just the beginning. The other question about the solutions, it
[03:35:37.320 --> 03:35:42.880]  makes news when these politicians show up somewhere and all of a sudden they
[03:35:42.880 --> 03:35:49.920]  start getting drowned out by crowds just like Pom Pom Pelosi did yesterday as she
[03:35:49.920 --> 03:35:55.560]  was shouted down for the continuation of the wars and all the other backtracking
[03:35:55.560 --> 03:36:01.320]  that she's done. People have to get involved and it all starts within and
[03:36:01.320 --> 03:36:07.960]  this is in spiritual you know mumbo jumbo. It's a fact. If you want the there's
[03:36:07.960 --> 03:36:14.640]  an old saying when the people are ready the leader arrives. People have to start
[03:36:14.640 --> 03:36:21.880]  engaging. They have to get in shape physically emotionally and spiritually.
[03:36:21.880 --> 03:36:27.400]  We cannot go on the way we are. We're looking at a country that of the
[03:36:27.400 --> 03:36:33.440]  people over 50 we're looking at 40% of them becoming obese and try to achieve
[03:36:33.440 --> 03:36:38.840]  anything great. We have to get in shape in every way we can. You know this John
[03:36:38.840 --> 03:36:43.720]  Wooden that just died, that great basketball coach from UCLA. I was reading
[03:36:43.720 --> 03:36:47.920]  his obituary and he used to carry this little sheet of paper around and one of
[03:36:47.920 --> 03:36:54.640]  the things that it said on it, create a masterpiece every day. Think in those terms
[03:36:54.640 --> 03:36:59.460]  of the greatness that you could achieve. Don't get dragged down by everybody else's
[03:36:59.460 --> 03:37:08.160]  trip and as we as a nation to do it in a practical manner, I don't buy anything
[03:37:08.160 --> 03:37:12.240]  from China. Well here's an example to interrupt briefly. I'll let you finish
[03:37:12.240 --> 03:37:15.760]  up and let you go Gerald. I was watching a documentary last night with my
[03:37:15.760 --> 03:37:21.760]  children on PBS on KLRU locally about the history of Pluto and
[03:37:21.760 --> 03:37:29.240]  how a farm boy with almost no education built his own telescopes out of old
[03:37:29.240 --> 03:37:34.960]  tractor parts in mirrors, impressed the local observatory, would come in there on
[03:37:34.960 --> 03:37:39.040]  the weekends and clean it and polish the equipment for free when he was like 17,
[03:37:39.040 --> 03:37:43.600]  18 years old and then on his own would take these high-tech systems of the day
[03:37:43.600 --> 03:37:47.560]  that the observatory didn't even know how to properly use and take photographs
[03:37:47.560 --> 03:37:52.520]  at night and then overlay them and on his own found Pluto when he was like 20
[03:37:52.520 --> 03:37:56.720]  years old. That's what made America great with almost all the inventions and
[03:37:56.720 --> 03:38:00.440]  everything else. You know, he was in 18 years old, you know, out there getting
[03:38:00.440 --> 03:38:05.200]  drunk acting like an idiot. He was out there finding Pluto. I'm sorry to
[03:38:05.200 --> 03:38:10.360]  digress but there were so many Americans like that. How do we go from that to the
[03:38:10.360 --> 03:38:15.560]  jellyfish so many people are today? Well again, the change has already happened
[03:38:15.560 --> 03:38:21.360]  and it's happening with the tea parties. So anybody that says that the future is
[03:38:21.360 --> 03:38:26.840]  predetermined is trying to rob you of your dignity and the soul within you.
[03:38:26.840 --> 03:38:33.160]  We create the future and we could have in America far greater than we can ever
[03:38:33.160 --> 03:38:41.440]  imagine if people engage into it in a moral way not by violence or guns but by
[03:38:41.440 --> 03:38:47.960]  minds and intellect and again on a simple level it's summertime. Grow as much as
[03:38:47.960 --> 03:38:53.680]  you can rip up those lawns that you're dumping chemicals on to go grass
[03:38:53.680 --> 03:38:59.360]  that you can't eat or smoke and do something productive on it. Support your
[03:38:59.360 --> 03:39:05.400]  local go-to-the-farmers markets. They're all over the place. Become involved on
[03:39:05.400 --> 03:39:11.680]  the local level not as a political but somebody that becomes
[03:39:11.680 --> 03:39:16.080]  involved to know what's going on so that you can direct it in the manner that
[03:39:16.080 --> 03:39:22.200]  you believe. Teach your children. Teach your children to be honest at every
[03:39:22.200 --> 03:39:27.440]  possible level and to do business cleanly. So those are the things that we
[03:39:27.440 --> 03:39:31.120]  could do and again as I was mentioning I don't buy anything from China I don't
[03:39:31.120 --> 03:39:35.520]  have to. Unfortunately we have to buy electronic equipment because most of
[03:39:35.520 --> 03:39:39.280]  it's made there but anything else I'll go into a store I look at the bottom I
[03:39:39.280 --> 03:39:44.240]  believe in the golden rule both of them. Do unto others as you would have them do
[03:39:44.240 --> 03:39:48.760]  unto you and those that have the gold rule and I don't want to be ruled by the
[03:39:48.760 --> 03:39:54.480]  Chinese so we need to do business with each other. I come up with a little
[03:39:54.480 --> 03:40:03.640]  Gandhi. Gandhi brought down the English Empire when they controlled India. How
[03:40:03.640 --> 03:40:11.080]  did he do it? He told the people don't buy anything from them. Make your own and
[03:40:11.080 --> 03:40:16.480]  there's a movement going on right now in India that has that same miss message.
[03:40:16.480 --> 03:40:26.760]  Drink Indian. Eat Indian. Buy Indian. Buy US. Drink US. Support local. We can do it if
[03:40:26.760 --> 03:40:32.600]  we bring it all back. The people that's saying that we can't manufacture we can't
[03:40:32.600 --> 03:40:37.800]  build our way out of this have become the corporate slaves that don't have it
[03:40:37.800 --> 03:40:43.560]  within them the courage or the dignity to make that happen. I believe we could
[03:40:43.560 --> 03:40:48.640]  become an America far greater than we could ever imagine if we go back to
[03:40:48.640 --> 03:40:53.520]  what made us great before. Absolutely you mentioned the electronics. I try to buy
[03:40:53.520 --> 03:40:57.120]  American or at least Canadian or Mexican at least there's some trade between us
[03:40:57.120 --> 03:41:02.920]  and I never go in Walmart I hardly ever go in Target and I you know never buy
[03:41:02.920 --> 03:41:07.920]  things I don't need that are made overseas but at the same time we're
[03:41:07.920 --> 03:41:12.280]  coming out with these little flash drives that have info wars.com on them
[03:41:12.280 --> 03:41:15.360]  because people keep requesting them so what what gets requested we add to the
[03:41:15.360 --> 03:41:21.280]  store and that you cannot buy flash drives made in America now we are getting
[03:41:21.280 --> 03:41:26.760]  the info wars printed in America and guess what that costs twice as much as
[03:41:26.760 --> 03:41:31.240]  it does to have it done in China so these things are going to cost a couple
[03:41:31.240 --> 03:41:36.640]  dollars more than this flash drive at the store because the info wars.com is
[03:41:36.640 --> 03:41:43.440]  printed in America and so I mean you cannot find them made in America what
[03:41:43.440 --> 03:41:47.920]  is the I mean we have a sponsor got a diamond gusset jeans made in Tennessee
[03:41:47.920 --> 03:41:51.120]  and Georgia you know and they cost a few bucks more because there's higher taxes
[03:41:51.120 --> 03:41:54.640]  regulations but there are a lot better jeans you know we have to make the
[03:41:54.640 --> 03:42:00.040]  decision that's right we have to make the decision and we have to make it in the
[03:42:00.040 --> 03:42:07.560]  USA and until we do that we're doomed we cannot survive by becoming a service
[03:42:07.560 --> 03:42:14.200]  sector society and consuming more than we produce it's impossible so it can be
[03:42:14.200 --> 03:42:19.320]  reversed and again you know I don't eat corporate food I'm Italian I know a
[03:42:19.320 --> 03:42:24.040]  good food I don't do that you know so and as I don't go into Walmart I go into
[03:42:24.040 --> 03:42:28.920]  Walmart just to do research it's like going into a large self-storage unit you
[03:42:28.920 --> 03:42:33.280]  know so we have to get back to the quality that this country used to have
[03:42:33.280 --> 03:42:38.440]  and what we have in a trends journal when you talk about solutions it's called
[03:42:38.440 --> 03:42:45.360]  the 20% solution if 20% of the people go into a new direction the rest will
[03:42:45.360 --> 03:42:50.520]  follow the sheep will go in any direction you want and I believe there are
[03:42:50.520 --> 03:42:55.520]  20% of the people out there that want the country to go into that direction that
[03:42:55.520 --> 03:43:01.320]  can stop wars that could stop us going on the path that we're on if they stand
[03:43:01.320 --> 03:43:05.600]  up regain their courage and their dignity absolutely Gerald Salente we're
[03:43:05.600 --> 03:43:11.040]  gonna let you go briefly tell folks what is in this month's key trends research
[03:43:11.040 --> 03:43:15.480]  dot com journal and how folks get a digital or hard copy well they could go
[03:43:15.480 --> 03:43:21.160]  to our website trends research dot com or trends journal dot com and what we're
[03:43:21.160 --> 03:43:25.920]  working on now in the upcoming summer issue that'll be out in several weeks
[03:43:25.920 --> 03:43:31.680]  mid mid July latest is really how to survive and thrive in these coming times
[03:43:31.680 --> 03:43:36.040]  and among the things to do and I don't give financial advice I'm telling you
[03:43:36.040 --> 03:43:42.640]  what I do I have 80% of my money in gold I used to have my my cash split
[03:43:42.640 --> 03:43:48.320]  between dollars and euros now it's split between dollars Frank's Swiss Frank's
[03:43:48.320 --> 03:43:54.440]  and Canadian dollars all I want to do in this time with my cash and investments
[03:43:54.440 --> 03:44:00.880]  is not to lose it gold is my wild card I believe that gold is going to go to
[03:44:00.880 --> 03:44:07.120]  $2,000 an ounce this year it looks like $1,500 an ounce well that's what Mark
[03:44:07.120 --> 03:44:11.120]  Twain said that's what Mark Twain said he said I don't care about the return on
[03:44:11.120 --> 03:44:16.440]  my money all I want is the return of my money when speaking of banking yeah and
[03:44:16.440 --> 03:44:21.360]  that's exactly it and people start to we really believe they should start
[03:44:21.360 --> 03:44:26.840]  preparing for the worst to come if you if the worst doesn't come and you made
[03:44:26.840 --> 03:44:32.360]  provisions you've lost nothing if the worst happens as we see it happening and
[03:44:32.360 --> 03:44:36.920]  you've made no provisions then you lose everything well in closing I want to
[03:44:36.920 --> 03:44:41.480]  just say this it's already happened the media is lying about jobs but even with
[03:44:41.480 --> 03:44:46.240]  cook numbers 95% are government with them firing and rehiring the census people
[03:44:46.240 --> 03:44:51.600]  every month on record stores are shutting down everywhere all I hear is
[03:44:51.600 --> 03:44:56.120]  debt ads on the radio all I see is more homeless people everywhere
[03:44:56.120 --> 03:45:02.040]  Mexico's fully collapsed they're laying off police and firemen and essential
[03:45:02.040 --> 03:45:06.160]  services everywhere but the taxes are going up on interest of the bankers I
[03:45:06.160 --> 03:45:10.120]  mean we've got a default on all this fraudulent stuff or it's over so your
[03:45:10.120 --> 03:45:13.320]  predictions came true Gerald my predictions came true it's just
[03:45:13.320 --> 03:45:17.520]  unfortunately your prediction of the greatest depression now looks like a
[03:45:17.520 --> 03:45:21.840]  certainty and so we're going from trying to stop the bankers from ruining
[03:45:21.840 --> 03:45:27.640]  us to now trying to just salvage something and people better get up off
[03:45:27.640 --> 03:45:32.040]  their hind ends now Gerald Salente thank you for spending an hour and 45 minutes
[03:45:32.040 --> 03:45:34.760]  with us today and we'll talk to you again in the near future hey thank you
[03:45:34.760 --> 03:45:41.040]  Alex there goes Gerald Salente thank you Gerald trendsresearch.com I mean I go
[03:45:41.040 --> 03:45:44.720]  home every night when I get home early enough to eat dinner with the family and
[03:45:44.720 --> 03:45:48.400]  I'm sitting there with my wife and you know we're eating dinner and she's just
[03:45:48.400 --> 03:45:52.720]  like we need to sell this house and get to the country and I'm like well honey
[03:45:52.720 --> 03:45:57.640]  I can't commute an hour and a half into the office I mean it is but it's
[03:45:57.640 --> 03:46:03.000]  becoming the point of it's not a luxury to live in the country it's a necessity
[03:46:03.000 --> 03:46:07.240]  but I've got a big crew here and people I've got to direct and work I've got to
[03:46:07.240 --> 03:46:11.400]  do and I'm 30 minutes already from my office at 25 minutes but I mean I don't
[03:46:11.400 --> 03:46:17.920]  want to be in the city when all the all hell breaks loose I don't know what I'm
[03:46:17.920 --> 03:46:22.360]  gonna do I mean it's like I know intellectually that I'm right I don't
[03:46:22.360 --> 03:46:25.480]  get up here and say things I don't think are true people like 10 years ago
[03:46:25.480 --> 03:46:29.480]  Alex says they're gonna sell derivatives and have a global financial meltdown and
[03:46:29.480 --> 03:46:34.200]  set up a bank of the world and a global carbon tax that guys are lunatic I was
[03:46:34.200 --> 03:46:42.400]  reading you in Club of Rome Trilateral Commission documents I mean this is not
[03:46:42.400 --> 03:46:48.800]  me sitting here predicting the future okay I mean this is what these people do
[03:46:48.800 --> 03:46:51.640]  it's what they've done in third world countries over and over again Gerald's
[03:46:51.640 --> 03:46:54.720]  been able to predict the future by exactly when it's gonna happen by
[03:46:54.720 --> 03:46:58.080]  tracking their criminal activities I just knew they were training them out
[03:46:58.080 --> 03:47:02.480]  listen let me tell you something 13 years ago I went to my first urban
[03:47:02.480 --> 03:47:06.800]  warfare drill and witnessed US Marines with foreign troops training to take
[03:47:06.800 --> 03:47:10.920]  Americans guns and admitting it was for America and I went on the air and I
[03:47:10.920 --> 03:47:13.960]  said I don't know if they're gonna try it this year or 10 years from now but
[03:47:13.960 --> 03:47:19.960]  they are training our military for martial law we've got a problem ladies and
[03:47:19.960 --> 03:47:24.920]  gentlemen and then I read what the big central banks had done all over the
[03:47:24.920 --> 03:47:31.080]  world I read and researched what they'd done over and over again and these
[03:47:31.080 --> 03:47:40.920]  people are obsessive compulsive they are creatures of habit they I'm trying to
[03:47:40.920 --> 03:47:45.840]  think of the proper word for it they're pathological they just do it over and
[03:47:45.840 --> 03:47:50.960]  over and over and over and over I mean we know how they break up families we
[03:47:50.960 --> 03:47:54.200]  know how they put in surveillance we know how they federalize police we know
[03:47:54.200 --> 03:47:57.840]  how they shut up FEMA centers we know how they collapse societies as their
[03:47:57.840 --> 03:48:04.360]  cover we know how they launch wars we know what they do you know I get intel
[03:48:04.360 --> 03:48:10.280]  in January of last year 18 months ago or more now and I get emergency managers
[03:48:10.280 --> 03:48:13.680]  on and I get the actual documents and I call the phone numbers in the bureau of
[03:48:13.680 --> 03:48:18.360]  cemeteries asked me how did you get this in New York and they get hopping mad and
[03:48:18.360 --> 03:48:21.440]  say hold on I'm calling the police you're not supposed to have that you know I
[03:48:21.440 --> 03:48:27.000]  found out it was real that they were gonna launch some type of flu hysteria I
[03:48:27.000 --> 03:48:33.640]  knew three months before but we were able to get the jump on them and so record
[03:48:33.640 --> 03:48:36.720]  numbers didn't take it they weren't able to go to full martial law I mean
[03:48:36.720 --> 03:48:40.040]  ladies and gentlemen you know what it's like to have the responsibility to know
[03:48:40.040 --> 03:48:44.760]  in the aggregate hundreds of millions of people listen to me on a month-to-month
[03:48:44.760 --> 03:48:50.600]  year-to-year basis and that this is life and death this isn't a game the FEMA
[03:48:50.600 --> 03:48:55.400]  camps aren't a game the cancer viruses and the vaccines aren't a game the
[03:48:55.400 --> 03:48:58.560]  sodium fluoride in the water that literally attacks every organ in your
[03:48:58.560 --> 03:49:03.880]  body isn't a game and then I see a show on Cartoon Network like squid billies
[03:49:03.880 --> 03:49:08.880]  where they're ignorant you know you know it's always okay to have a stereotype
[03:49:08.880 --> 03:49:13.800]  of Southerners is a bunch of scum racist filth morons who have who who think
[03:49:13.800 --> 03:49:18.040]  fluoride is gonna attack their testicles and sterilize them that's actually what
[03:49:18.040 --> 03:49:23.400]  it does I can pull up in fact I meant to go over this with a piece I meant to
[03:49:23.400 --> 03:49:29.480]  play the squid billies when we go into overdrive but I I had a folder with
[03:49:29.480 --> 03:49:33.520]  Aaron the other day because I was gonna do this then I didn't do it that had
[03:49:33.520 --> 03:49:37.800]  all the EPA admissions that it sterilizes you and the articles about how
[03:49:37.800 --> 03:49:42.480]  it causes cancer hey wait will you call Aaron in here real fast because I can
[03:49:42.480 --> 03:49:45.840]  have him by the time the official show ends he can I mean you can print
[03:49:45.840 --> 03:49:50.520]  thousands of these government studies you know photos of the rats testicles
[03:49:50.520 --> 03:49:55.360]  tripled up to nothing after one part per million fluoride for a few months I
[03:49:55.360 --> 03:50:02.120]  mean it just it's unbelievable and and so I wanted to play this squid billies
[03:50:02.120 --> 03:50:10.280]  thing but I I may not have time to do that is he down there he's coming in
[03:50:10.280 --> 03:50:14.440]  now hey Aaron I had meant to go into overdrive when I cover Chris Matthews
[03:50:14.440 --> 03:50:19.120]  demonization how we got a script and how I was also gonna hit some other from
[03:50:19.120 --> 03:50:22.120]  news who admit now admits he attends Bilderberg he's been writing
[03:50:22.120 --> 03:50:25.600]  demonization pieces on Ron Paul myself ran Paul and now he admits he's a new
[03:50:25.600 --> 03:50:29.600]  old order guy wrote a story about himself in the National Post to Canada
[03:50:29.600 --> 03:50:35.000]  of course he came up with access to evil term can you go just print me a couple
[03:50:35.000 --> 03:50:38.280]  mainstream articles about fluoride doubling cancer some will say four
[03:50:38.280 --> 03:50:44.680]  times and that majority of EPA scientists sent the letter to the EPA
[03:50:44.680 --> 03:50:47.960]  saying it's dangerous like EPA toxicologists they removed fluoride and
[03:50:47.960 --> 03:50:50.800]  print me one about American Dental Association says don't brush your teeth
[03:50:50.800 --> 03:50:54.440]  with fluoride just get me those one of the squid billies don't want to play it

[04:01:14.440 --> 04:01:17.840]  swallow more than a pea size of it and of course the fluoride builds up
[04:01:17.840 --> 04:01:21.680]  cumulatively in the body you know i decided to do this overdrive just about
[04:01:21.680 --> 04:01:24.960]  30 minutes ago and i just called Aaron here about 10 minutes ago and i said
[04:01:24.960 --> 04:01:28.760]  hey i need some documentation on fluoride because i have it on my brain
[04:01:28.760 --> 04:01:31.600]  but i like to show people and this is just what he brought in quickly he's

[04:01:37.120 --> 04:01:41.560]  news second thoughts on fluoride report scientific american fluoride and drinking

[04:02:12.240 --> 04:02:15.680]  recap all this i'm gonna recap all of this
[04:02:15.680 --> 04:02:20.640]  uh... coming up and uh... few of the callers that were still on when we
[04:02:20.640 --> 04:02:24.880]  ended the official radio show about five minutes ago
[04:02:24.880 --> 04:02:31.600]  uh... are welcome to call in at 888-201-2244 888-201-2244
[04:02:31.600 --> 04:02:35.520]  uh... but just those that were still on hold because i do want to get to you
[04:02:35.520 --> 04:02:39.280]  uh... but the reason we had to go into overdrive is there's no way
[04:02:39.280 --> 04:02:42.960]  with all the guests we had on Gerald Salente uh... and others
[04:02:42.960 --> 04:02:46.880]  uh... there's no way uh... that i can just end the show and not talk about this
[04:02:46.880 --> 04:02:52.320]  because this is worse than i had uh... first guessed it would be now
[04:02:52.320 --> 04:02:55.760]  i guess it was four or five months ago chris mathews calls up here at the
[04:02:55.760 --> 04:02:59.280]  office chris mathews and then they say we want to come interview you
[04:02:59.280 --> 04:03:03.600]  and then then they give me his producer and i talked to her and she says
[04:03:03.600 --> 04:03:06.480]  and i said let me guess it's a bait and switch to make sure i'll do the
[04:03:06.480 --> 04:03:10.080]  interview you claim chris mathews is coming but he's going to cancel at the
[04:03:10.080 --> 04:03:12.880]  last minute she says i guarantee you he won't
[04:03:12.880 --> 04:03:17.120]  he's going to be doing town halls in uh... houston he wants to meet with you
[04:03:17.120 --> 04:03:20.320]  and i said okay i'll be friendly bringing
[04:03:20.320 --> 04:03:23.840]  less than six hours before he was to be here they said oh he can't come now and
[04:03:23.840 --> 04:03:27.040]  i said i expected that and i'd also told him on the phone
[04:03:27.040 --> 04:03:31.840]  you will show white supremacist and hitler and uh... you will show malicious
[04:03:31.840 --> 04:03:35.280]  shooting guns and then you will cut to me and ran paul and ronpaul
[04:03:35.280 --> 04:03:38.880]  and they said that no what it is is what this is a reasonable
[04:03:38.880 --> 04:03:42.080]  view of the tea party we want to understand you and be friendly we want
[04:03:42.080 --> 04:03:43.040]  to be friends
[04:03:43.040 --> 04:03:46.880]  kind of like rachel maddow told ran paul before she stabbed him in the back
[04:03:46.880 --> 04:03:49.680]  and i said listen i'm not stupid just like i told nightline
[04:03:49.680 --> 04:03:53.760]  i said uh... you guys are deceptive but i said come on down
[04:03:53.760 --> 04:03:57.360]  bring mathews and then he check him down and and when the lady was in studio
[04:03:57.360 --> 04:04:01.120]  she saw a gun over here in my desk not aimed at her
[04:04:01.120 --> 04:04:06.240]  357 magnum revolver just because it's a reliable gun under under stress
[04:04:06.240 --> 04:04:09.200]  anybody tries to come in here and do something we're not going to just get
[04:04:09.200 --> 04:04:12.800]  on our knees and hide it at the desk and say please please
[04:04:12.800 --> 04:04:16.320]  please i'm castrated or oh there's a man with a gun
[04:04:16.320 --> 04:04:20.560]  911 help me oh it'll be 12 minutes on average okay thank you
[04:04:20.560 --> 04:04:26.240]  no no time is of the essence is why don't have some fancy semi-auto or
[04:04:26.240 --> 04:04:30.960]  something or some no no no no i just this is pull the trigger baby
[04:04:30.960 --> 04:04:34.960]  she saw the gun during the interview and also she started crying and i thought i
[04:04:34.960 --> 04:04:41.760]  had touched her heart i this one was me
[04:04:41.760 --> 04:04:44.800]  and she got tears in her eyes and she was an attractive british lady
[04:04:44.800 --> 04:04:48.880]  and i was like are you okay she goes is that
[04:04:48.880 --> 04:04:53.360]  she was unable to breathe she'd been so programmed and so brainwashed like like
[04:04:53.360 --> 04:05:01.200]  freddy kruger was over her bed at night she was
[04:05:01.200 --> 04:05:05.440]  i should have a digital recorder recording at all i ought to play that
[04:05:05.440 --> 04:05:08.000]  like where are those recorders do we say that that i have the guys dump that
[04:05:08.000 --> 04:05:10.960]  off when they were here this is my backup we ought to actually find that
[04:05:10.960 --> 04:05:14.080]  audio the next few days and play it it's like a three hour interview
[04:05:14.080 --> 04:05:18.080]  and then get the but you can't i mean i was sitting right here where i'm
[04:05:18.080 --> 04:05:21.200]  sitting she was sitting right here their camera was over there they had another
[04:05:21.200 --> 04:05:26.000]  camera over here and i'm talking to her she sees the gun and
[04:05:26.000 --> 04:05:29.680]  starts getting tears in her eyes and i mean literally
[04:05:29.680 --> 04:05:32.800]  like she was having a heart attack and i was like are you okay honey
[04:05:32.800 --> 04:05:38.320]  she said is that you tell like she couldn't breathe you ever had a dream
[04:05:38.320 --> 04:05:40.880]  where you can't breathe and it's real scary i've had a few of those and she
[04:05:40.880 --> 04:05:47.840]  was like
[04:05:47.840 --> 04:05:51.840]  i mean it went on and it was like a slave
[04:05:51.840 --> 04:05:55.120]  people are doubting me i may just play the audio
[04:05:55.120 --> 04:05:59.680]  just remember i've recorded it as backup in case they edited me
[04:05:59.680 --> 04:06:04.320]  and this went on for about 30 seconds and she said is that the
[04:06:04.320 --> 04:06:07.920]  gun and all you can see was the butt of it on the shelf
[04:06:07.920 --> 04:06:16.240]  um you know the handle and i said yeah i mean i protect myself i protect my
[04:06:16.240 --> 04:06:19.120]  office we got guys that can still carry in here as well
[04:06:19.120 --> 04:06:23.040]  and she just i'm sorry i just didn't i just didn't expect
[04:06:23.040 --> 04:06:27.760]  i'm hold on hold on i'm i'm collecting my this is not a joke folks
[04:06:27.760 --> 04:06:33.280]  like we can continue and she's going and the next question
[04:06:33.280 --> 04:06:36.960]  but this woman sees body scanners scanning her naked body
[04:06:36.960 --> 04:06:40.720]  cameras troops in black uniforms marching if you know history that's what
[04:06:40.720 --> 04:06:44.320]  scares you whoa i'm going into a third world dictatorship
[04:06:44.320 --> 04:06:47.600]  but no she wasn't worried about that and turned out this woman's been all over
[04:06:47.600 --> 04:06:51.280]  the world combat zones you name it she's not scared because there it's troops
[04:06:51.280 --> 04:06:56.800]  with gods they're allowed to have guns but you see a slave
[04:06:56.800 --> 04:07:00.080]  this is a woman who'll fly into combat zone she's not afraid
[04:07:00.080 --> 04:07:04.480]  but to see a a fellow slave with a gun
[04:07:04.480 --> 04:07:10.880]  is blasphemy it's just absolute total and complete blasphemy
[04:07:10.880 --> 04:07:14.960]  i mean this was sacrilege to her to see
[04:07:14.960 --> 04:07:21.760]  a blood bag i mean that's what i am like the matrix or like the movie
[04:07:21.760 --> 04:07:25.200]  what's the new vampire movie i rob recommended so i wash it when i was on

[04:07:45.120 --> 04:07:48.160]  the name of that movie
[04:07:50.160 --> 04:07:56.960]  but the point is that that's what we are we're like creatures in a machine
[04:07:56.960 --> 04:08:03.920]  sucking our blood uh we're like cattle we are seen here to provide
[04:08:03.920 --> 04:08:10.720]  daybreakers we are here to provide our souls our money our kids
[04:08:10.720 --> 04:08:16.080]  everything the globalists see it as if they control the entire society
[04:08:16.080 --> 04:08:21.920]  and so this woman sees troops swat teams guns fema camps she feels safe
[04:08:21.920 --> 04:08:25.680]  when she sees big black armored vehicles and tanks
[04:08:25.680 --> 04:08:29.920]  and big monolithic government buildings and thugs and cps grabbing
[04:08:29.920 --> 04:08:34.720]  children and corruption she just cozy's up like a snake around their leg
[04:08:34.720 --> 04:08:39.040]  but she comes into some red-blooded tanned redneck american who isn't her
[04:08:39.040 --> 04:08:42.000]  slave and she comes in here with a you know with a man with a little bit of
[04:08:42.000 --> 04:08:44.720]  hair on his chest and it just scares the living
[04:08:44.720 --> 04:08:47.520]  daylights out of her she had thought she'd entered the
[04:08:47.520 --> 04:08:51.120]  night circle of hell she was in a room with a with a
[04:08:51.120 --> 04:08:59.680]  four-tailed devil this is a domesticated slave this is a domesticated worm
[04:08:59.680 --> 04:09:02.960]  this is a domesticated serf this is someone who
[04:09:02.960 --> 04:09:09.920]  sees a human who isn't castrated i mean i would imagine a domesticated pig
[04:09:09.920 --> 04:09:13.920]  in a pig pen watching a wild pig run around you know out there in the field
[04:09:13.920 --> 04:09:16.160]  100 yards away that probably actually scare a pig
[04:09:16.160 --> 04:09:19.360]  because it would have memories of being a free hog it would have memories of
[04:09:19.360 --> 04:09:21.680]  running around squealing and rooting and having a good time
[04:09:21.680 --> 04:09:24.880]  and it'd be sitting there eating its slop about to get slaughtered it
[04:09:24.880 --> 04:09:28.880]  oh that's another pig that's scary it would squeal and
[04:09:28.880 --> 04:09:33.920]  run over to the humans and curl up and do something about that pig out there
[04:09:33.920 --> 04:09:39.200]  it's so deadly i mean it's disgusting it's like a a cow in a
[04:09:39.200 --> 04:09:42.000]  squeeze shoot at a slaughterhouse before the gas bolt
[04:09:42.000 --> 04:09:45.840]  comes down and drives a hammer into its head and and fells it
[04:09:45.840 --> 04:09:49.440]  and kills it so it can be rendered down into in the t-bone stakes
[04:09:49.440 --> 04:09:54.720]  imagine it getting angry at a cow in a field oh look at that cow in a field
[04:09:54.720 --> 04:09:59.360]  it has horns it hasn't been dehorned i had my horns cut off a long time ago
[04:09:59.360 --> 04:10:03.120]  i've had all my vaccines i'm going into the slaughterhouse
[04:10:03.120 --> 04:10:07.440]  oh i like the government whoa i love it i'm here by my legs and drain me a blood
[04:10:07.440 --> 04:10:11.200]  i love serving government it's so much fun it's so good
[04:10:11.200 --> 04:10:14.560]  i mean literally you've got to experience
[04:10:14.560 --> 04:10:18.320]  it's like that video we have in road to tyranny of the police own squad car at
[04:10:18.320 --> 04:10:20.560]  a checkpoint they're searching everybody's cars
[04:10:20.560 --> 04:10:23.520]  abby newman one of my listeners navel batter and no criminal record in town
[04:10:23.520 --> 04:10:26.480]  buying candy equipment they say we want to search their car she says no
[04:10:26.480 --> 04:10:29.440]  they open the trunk up put her in handcuffs find a pocket constitution
[04:10:29.440 --> 04:10:35.040]  and start hyperventilating on video going i can't believe she's got one we
[04:10:35.040 --> 04:10:39.200]  found an extremist she's got paraphernalia i can't believe
[04:10:39.200 --> 04:10:42.880]  he says i can't believe we found one of these people he's like what do we do
[04:10:42.880 --> 04:10:46.000]  do we arrest her for this and supervisor comes over and this is in
[04:10:46.000 --> 04:10:48.640]  virginia he goes i don't know maybe she's a
[04:10:48.640 --> 04:10:52.720]  she allowed to have that maybe that's what she's talking about what she says
[04:10:52.720 --> 04:10:56.880]  she has rights i don't care go ahead and arrest her
[04:10:56.880 --> 04:11:01.680]  i mean you don't go right you don't
[04:11:01.680 --> 04:11:06.560]  so i guess it's the same thing we got one with a pocket constitution
[04:11:06.560 --> 04:11:14.320]  it's the same thing with this british woman oh my god is that uh uh uh it was tears
[04:11:15.120 --> 04:11:19.680]  god it was like a money python episode
[04:11:19.920 --> 04:11:24.160]  it was like in a fish called wander when the guy can't talk any stuttering
[04:11:26.560 --> 04:11:30.640]  you know when the guy's stuttering when the guy's eating his fish
[04:11:30.640 --> 04:11:36.640]  some fish and chips so i mean it just goes on and on and on
[04:11:36.640 --> 04:11:42.640]  i have seen the mind control slaves i have seen state police going
[04:11:42.640 --> 04:11:47.920]  literally going oh my god look at that thank you people go watch road to
[04:11:47.920 --> 04:11:50.480]  terry it's a three hour film it's like two and a half hours in
[04:11:50.480 --> 04:11:56.240]  from the squad car you cannot make the magnitude up of this
[04:11:56.240 --> 04:12:03.040]  but i mean in that woman you see the whole world this is a person again
[04:12:03.040 --> 04:12:10.640]  who saw the butt of this gun sticking out she saw this
[04:12:10.640 --> 04:12:15.520]  in a shelf
[04:12:16.080 --> 04:12:24.080]  i mean amazing amazing to her that i am here to defend myself i'm not living
[04:12:24.080 --> 04:12:27.920]  in fear i'm living in power i'm living as a sovereign i'm going to defend myself
[04:12:28.720 --> 04:12:32.720]  instead they lock down schools when a gunman's in them and make him get into
[04:12:32.720 --> 04:12:37.040]  the chair so they're not running they don't tell them go out the window go out
[04:12:37.040 --> 04:12:40.720]  the nearest exit we'll direct you they don't say we have the principle with a gun
[04:12:40.720 --> 04:12:43.680]  that's happened a few times where they've stopped mass shooting till they say
[04:12:43.680 --> 04:12:47.360]  you go get under your chair and wait for them to blow your head off
[04:12:47.360 --> 04:12:50.960]  so i was supposed to see see if gunman come in here i'm supposed to oh yes sir
[04:12:50.960 --> 04:12:54.640]  let me you're going to kill me here let me let me get in a fetal position so you
[04:12:54.640 --> 04:12:58.160]  have to look me in the eyes when you again it's the same training in nazi
[04:12:58.160 --> 04:13:01.840]  germany where you see those big pits the the 16 millimeter film shot by the
[04:13:01.840 --> 04:13:05.840]  nazis they're all standing around satisfied in a power trip
[04:13:05.840 --> 04:13:08.960]  they got their guys with machine guns lined up there's pits and you know they
[04:13:08.960 --> 04:13:11.520]  dig these pits they don't want to bury just one group
[04:13:11.520 --> 04:13:15.360]  there's there's already 50 60 bodies in there and groups of 10
[04:13:15.360 --> 04:13:19.200]  they run the next line through and the guys have their hats in hand and they
[04:13:19.200 --> 04:13:22.800]  they bow respectfully oh thank you mister you're gonna kill me
[04:13:22.800 --> 04:13:26.320]  i mean so what have you got a gun i'm gonna run up try to bite him
[04:13:26.320 --> 04:13:29.680]  i'm gonna gouge his eyes out i'm in a headbutt you want to see somebody go

[04:13:33.920 --> 04:13:37.680]  wonder i got testosterone nobody cut my testicles off
[04:13:37.680 --> 04:13:41.520]  nobody sucked my soul out but no they you know almost black and white films
[04:13:41.520 --> 04:13:43.600]  they have the hat in their hand and they
[04:13:43.600 --> 04:13:47.920]  they they run down into the pit they and then get their heads blown off in the
[04:13:47.920 --> 04:13:51.760]  next group get in there yes sir thank you
[04:13:51.760 --> 04:13:57.840]  i'm gonna do what she say she sees all of this tyranny that should worry her
[04:13:57.840 --> 04:14:01.200]  that should concern her instincts and she doesn't care
[04:14:01.200 --> 04:14:07.280]  she cares that i am not a slave it is fundamental her religion is being
[04:14:07.280 --> 04:14:11.280]  prostrate before tyranny her religion is being a victim
[04:14:11.280 --> 04:14:16.720]  her religion is being weak her religion is being domesticated
[04:14:16.720 --> 04:14:20.400]  think about it some woman whose ancestors were the wild and
[04:14:20.400 --> 04:14:24.080]  uh you know wonderful people of britain who the romans feared whenever they
[04:14:24.080 --> 04:14:26.480]  invaded not anymore she's just a domesticated
[04:14:26.480 --> 04:14:30.960]  we're a 1900 years of domestication
[04:14:38.240 --> 04:14:41.360]  i mean this is insanity ladies and gentlemen this
[04:14:41.360 --> 04:14:44.960]  is think of who would want to marry a woman
[04:14:44.960 --> 04:14:48.960]  who you'd have kids with and if somebody tried to assault your kids at the park
[04:14:48.960 --> 04:14:52.080]  or at home when you're not there wouldn't defend your children
[04:14:52.080 --> 04:14:57.120]  i want a woman who's sweet and beautiful and and and and and calm and and and
[04:14:57.120 --> 04:15:00.800]  ladylike but who can turn into an absolute vicious killer
[04:15:00.800 --> 04:15:03.760]  and that's what women are supposed to be like if they need to be not these
[04:15:03.760 --> 04:15:06.960]  little domesticated prissy things that can't stand up for themselves that's
[04:15:06.960 --> 04:15:10.320]  real feminism real feminism is when somebody knocks down your
[04:15:10.320 --> 04:15:14.560]  college daughter's door and a raper she fires 14 rounds
[04:15:14.560 --> 04:15:19.920]  a 45 magnum into them that's what feminism is
[04:15:19.920 --> 04:15:24.000]  not your crap all right i've had enough of it i've had enough of scum i've had
[04:15:24.000 --> 04:15:27.120]  enough of domestication i've had enough of people that tell me i've
[04:15:27.120 --> 04:15:31.120]  got to be a pathetic slave come on in erin

[04:15:36.320 --> 04:15:41.360]  all right i'm ranting because this is this is someone who's not domesticated
[04:15:41.360 --> 04:15:45.280]  would you rather be me or rather be but remember
[04:15:45.280 --> 04:15:49.280]  remember she'd be very polite in nazi germany directed into a pit
[04:15:49.280 --> 04:15:53.040]  or take your clothes off get ready to go in here for showers yes sir thank you

[04:20:30.400 --> 04:20:35.280]  uh page after page sing militia groups militia militia militia members
[04:20:35.280 --> 04:20:38.880]  militia militia so they start saying militia militia militia
[04:20:38.880 --> 04:20:42.080]  and militia militia militia militia militia militia they're gonna kill you
[04:20:42.080 --> 04:20:45.120]  they're gonna get you they're violent they're evil then this is the biggest
[04:20:45.120 --> 04:20:47.600]  hit piece i've ever seen you've got to go read it for yourself
[04:20:47.600 --> 04:20:51.600]  and just deeper uh into the article because i'm the whole
[04:20:51.600 --> 04:20:55.600]  end i mean i'm their finale uh here uh at the
[04:20:55.600 --> 04:20:59.680]  end of this but as you go through it then it goes into
[04:20:59.680 --> 04:21:05.760]  jews and talks about jews over and over and over
[04:21:05.760 --> 04:21:09.840]  and over again you know militia groups jews are responsible for the great
[04:21:09.840 --> 04:21:12.480]  depression they'll probably edit this youtube video
[04:21:12.480 --> 04:21:16.560]  and and say i said that that's how they operate uh jews were responsible the
[04:21:16.560 --> 04:21:20.960]  great depression were responsible for the continuation of hard times
[04:21:20.960 --> 04:21:24.560]  and that maybe et al fitler in germany had some right ideas
[04:21:24.560 --> 04:21:27.760]  so they go back to the 30s and 40s to father
[04:21:27.760 --> 04:21:31.520]  coglin and say that they have to go
[04:21:31.520 --> 04:21:37.520]  back then to find somebody who was criticizing corrupt banks
[04:21:37.520 --> 04:21:40.880]  and so the message is if you believe the banks are robbing you what does glimbeck
[04:21:40.880 --> 04:21:44.640]  say builderberg groups good your races if you criticize it
[04:21:44.640 --> 04:21:47.600]  what is limbaugh saying every week so they got the right wing and the control
[04:21:47.600 --> 04:21:51.920]  left wing doing this father coglin the jew the christian
[04:21:51.920 --> 04:21:56.480]  and persecution 2622 it is my opinion that nazism the effect of communism
[04:21:56.480 --> 04:22:01.360]  cannot be liquidated uh in persecution complex until the
[04:22:01.360 --> 04:22:04.800]  religious jews and high places and synagogue and finance radio and press
[04:22:04.800 --> 04:22:08.960]  attack the cause attack forthright the errors the
[04:22:08.960 --> 04:22:11.920]  spread of communism together with their nations who support it
[04:22:11.920 --> 04:22:14.880]  then they cut to tea parties criticizing communism
[04:22:14.880 --> 04:22:19.440]  and the message is you support hitler and they say this guy supported hitler
[04:22:19.440 --> 04:22:22.560]  so they go back 60 70 years ago and go this guy
[04:22:22.560 --> 04:22:25.680]  supported hitler and he didn't like communism so
[04:22:25.680 --> 04:22:30.400]  if you criticize communism you want to murder jews
[04:22:30.400 --> 04:22:33.760]  so now you're nazis
[04:22:34.240 --> 04:22:37.360]  before these rumors about government tyranny reached the mainstream
[04:22:37.360 --> 04:22:40.960]  they often start with an extremely popular internet radio host named alex
[04:22:40.960 --> 04:22:43.360]  jones what does the washington post say
[04:22:43.360 --> 04:22:47.760]  in yesterday's article titled msnbc documentary on the right
[04:22:47.760 --> 04:22:50.960]  profiles berthers militias and alex jones it says i'm an internet radio

[04:23:38.480 --> 04:23:42.960]  no you don't so you're going to say i'm hitler
[04:23:42.960 --> 04:23:45.840]  but don't do it too much because you know uh people actually look into it and
[04:23:45.840 --> 04:23:48.640]  find out that all the nazi groups are government financed all the big ones
[04:23:48.640 --> 04:23:51.600]  like halter and others who attacked me 24 seven it's going to come out the

[04:23:55.600 --> 04:23:58.720]  before these rumors about government tyranny reached the mainstream so this

[04:24:09.360 --> 04:24:11.920]  look at the types of tyrants in the obama administration
[04:24:11.920 --> 04:24:15.360]  then they have none of my quotes from cast sunstein saying arrest us and ban
[04:24:15.360 --> 04:24:19.120]  free speech from that day or none of the quotes of all these other
[04:24:19.120 --> 04:24:22.720]  officials in government and senators saying ban free speech

[04:30:49.200 --> 04:30:52.880]  i was in studio one hour and five minutes it happened about one hour and
[04:30:52.880 --> 04:30:56.560]  five minutes before i was live on air and i said they're gonna blame it on me
[04:30:56.560 --> 04:31:00.480]  and this is a horrible act and probably staged and we don't need violence
[04:31:00.480 --> 04:31:04.320]  and one hour after that about two hours later
[04:31:04.320 --> 04:31:08.880]  from the event it's in the statesman implying that i was praising it and

[04:34:43.600 --> 04:34:45.760]  statements actually wants to become violent
[04:34:45.760 --> 04:34:49.840]  and wants to use that as an excuse to clamp down and have a real police state
[04:34:49.840 --> 04:34:54.560]  in america and that's when the revolt starts of course
[04:34:54.560 --> 04:34:57.760]  these are cuts i explained we don't want it to go to that and told the
[04:34:57.760 --> 04:35:00.560]  government not to do it but they were asking me when will there be violence
[04:35:00.560 --> 04:35:03.520]  and i said well this is some of the scenarios but then they cut it together
[04:35:03.520 --> 04:35:08.000]  to sound like i'm calling for it see and that's when the revolution starts
[04:35:08.000 --> 04:35:11.680]  that's when people are just gonna say okay you stop me at a checkpoint
[04:35:11.680 --> 04:35:16.880]  the government's being abusive lock and load say total cutting total trimming
[04:35:16.880 --> 04:35:20.960]  jones also one of the leading figures on 11 truther movement
[04:35:20.960 --> 04:35:23.680]  claiming that the u.s government was behind the terrorist attacks on the
[04:35:23.680 --> 04:35:27.040]  world trade center in the pentagon he maintains that he's neither part
[04:35:27.040 --> 04:35:31.440]  of the far right nor the left equally opposing both sides of the political
[04:35:31.440 --> 04:35:35.360]  spectrum but he they don't explain that the spectrum is fake
[04:35:35.360 --> 04:35:39.120]  it's fake is what i said a false system to limit debate
[04:35:39.120 --> 04:35:44.240]  and to divide us so do you know it's the oh i don't i don't i i hate all you i
[04:35:44.240 --> 04:35:47.680]  hate republicans and democrats no i'm saying that's a diversion
[04:35:47.680 --> 04:35:50.640]  to put you in a fake tribal camp to control your mind
[04:35:50.640 --> 04:35:57.360]  because you like hepsy coke ford chevy redskins cowboys you you're designed to
[04:35:57.360 --> 04:36:01.680]  pick a tribe this is fake he maintains that he's neither far
[04:36:01.680 --> 04:36:04.640]  right nor far left equally opposing both sides of the
[04:36:04.640 --> 04:36:07.600]  political spectrum but he certainly appeals to the anti-government elements
[04:36:07.600 --> 04:36:11.040]  of the new right i appealed to populist i appealed to people that are sick of
[04:36:11.040 --> 04:36:14.320]  being raped i appealed to liberals when bush was in
[04:36:14.320 --> 04:36:18.560]  because they thought i was a socialist or something because i didn't like tyranny
[04:36:18.560 --> 04:36:21.760]  and now they think i'm right wing because i don't like tyranny it's the same
[04:36:21.760 --> 04:36:25.520]  thing if you figure that out and yes people are figuring that out and here's
[04:36:25.520 --> 04:36:27.680]  the good news you know when they put out a race
[04:36:27.680 --> 04:36:31.120]  baiting racial division trailer for the movie machete and i i was sent the
[04:36:31.120 --> 04:36:34.080]  script and i talked to hispanic members his crew that were upset about it
[04:36:34.080 --> 04:36:39.200]  and now rodriguez says he's pulling the race war stuff out of his film
[04:36:39.200 --> 04:36:42.320]  i was contacted by his crew who was concerned
[04:36:42.320 --> 04:36:47.120]  who understand who are smart i was contacted by matthew's crew
[04:36:47.120 --> 04:36:51.120]  they are upset about this they know this is pure nazi
[04:36:51.120 --> 04:36:54.800]  propaganda you talk about nazi propaganda that the nazis were like
[04:36:54.800 --> 04:36:57.840]  these communists and jews and other groups are getting violent
[04:36:57.840 --> 04:37:00.800]  they're causing problems we've got to arrest them they're you know they're
[04:37:00.800 --> 04:37:05.520]  arming themselves this if you want to talk about nazi it's
[04:37:05.520 --> 04:37:09.440]  what chris mathews is doing using racial politics oh you don't like social
[04:37:09.440 --> 04:37:13.920]  health care you want government health care you're a racist hitler use race
[04:37:13.920 --> 04:37:17.920]  by saying racist groups were against the german people
[04:37:17.920 --> 04:37:22.880]  see it's hidden right in front of you folks the mustache belongs on chris
[04:37:22.880 --> 04:37:26.160]  mathews
[04:37:26.160 --> 04:37:29.040]  jones is also one of the leading figures he goes on he maintains that he's
[04:37:29.040 --> 04:37:33.120]  neither left or right and he goes on a big government kills big government
[04:37:33.120 --> 04:37:37.120]  slaves big government destroys and big government annihilates the individual
[04:37:37.120 --> 04:37:40.320]  well that's what george arwell and thomas jefferson said but oh again i'm a
[04:37:40.320 --> 04:37:44.800]  bad guy it's extreme talk but is it that different
[04:37:44.800 --> 04:37:47.840]  from the tea parties and the politicians rallying against big government
[04:37:47.840 --> 04:37:51.360]  so it's also to drive a wedge so that mainline tea party goes
[04:37:51.360 --> 04:37:54.000]  this is what mancow was saying this morning playing the playing the left
[04:37:54.000 --> 04:37:56.240]  right role that i guess he's meant to play
[04:37:56.240 --> 04:38:00.720]  you know alex being used in a trap to discredit the tea parties and i and i
[04:38:00.720 --> 04:38:04.160]  came back and i said oh really ran paul's approval rating went up
[04:38:04.160 --> 04:38:06.560]  just three weeks ago the republicans were trying to throw him under the bus
[04:38:06.560 --> 04:38:10.400]  saying he was hurting the republicans buying the democrat propaganda when his
[04:38:10.400 --> 04:38:13.200]  poll numbers went up stop being a bunch of cowards
[04:38:13.200 --> 04:38:16.800]  it's the republicans and democrats trying to keep everybody on the same
[04:38:16.800 --> 04:38:22.720]  political reservation no when chris mathews comes out
[04:38:22.720 --> 04:38:27.680]  and and says i claim i have millions of youtube views
[04:38:27.680 --> 04:38:31.680]  i'm gonna expose that was a lie that i showed them the millions of views
[04:38:31.680 --> 04:38:36.320]  the hundreds of millions or attempted to they didn't want to see it
[04:38:36.320 --> 04:38:41.040]  that's lying by omission again they're going to discredit themselves let them
[04:38:41.040 --> 04:38:46.160]  arrogantly bleed out politically honest oh there's a rush limbaugh.com
[04:38:46.160 --> 04:38:51.520]  there's info wars.com you can see it well above
[04:38:51.520 --> 04:38:56.560]  glenbeck is in gold and limbaugh is in red at alexa.com
[04:38:56.560 --> 04:39:01.280]  oh look at info wars and if you look at that gauge that is
[04:39:01.280 --> 04:39:07.600]  thousands of points ahead of limbaugh just and back
[04:39:07.600 --> 04:39:14.800]  hmm isn't that interesting isn't that just special
[04:39:14.800 --> 04:39:18.560]  alex claims she has millions of listeners really i claim it
[04:39:18.560 --> 04:39:22.560]  hmm well there's one of the biggest independent rating services out there

[04:44:02.400 --> 04:44:06.320]  be like that guy says coaxer bacteria poop aspartame
[04:44:06.320 --> 04:44:10.480]  it is go look up the manufacturing process of aspartame before you sit there
[04:44:10.480 --> 04:44:13.840]  and and and laugh at me because you don't know you're in a scientifically
[04:44:13.840 --> 04:44:17.760]  engineered dictatorship and i'm a mad dog patriot who's not
[04:44:17.760 --> 04:44:20.320]  domesticated sitting here in the monkey cage
[04:44:20.320 --> 04:44:23.520]  trying to warn you you're in the monkey cage next to me i'm like

[04:44:30.560 --> 04:44:33.840]  you know those little rabbit feeders they've got you know they're
[04:44:33.840 --> 04:44:37.120]  you know getting your fluoride shut up it's fun
[04:44:37.120 --> 04:44:42.000]  you know you like it i mean that's what's going on
[04:44:42.000 --> 04:44:46.000]  hold on chris mathews is coming on he's gonna expose how you're a cop
[04:44:46.000 --> 04:44:49.360]  killer oh here let's go back to it i mean
[04:44:49.360 --> 04:44:52.960]  these people are incredible
[04:44:54.720 --> 04:45:01.520]  and so every day i'm sent csi clips and all these other tv shows and dramas
[04:45:01.520 --> 04:45:06.560]  and every time i'm channel surfing you know let's say it's 10 o'clock at night
[04:45:06.560 --> 04:45:10.000]  wife and kids are asleep i got a radio interview coming up at 11
[04:45:10.000 --> 04:45:13.440]  i did this last night okay i'll watch some television i'm sick of surfing the
[04:45:13.440 --> 04:45:16.080]  internet i haven't watched it in a few weeks
[04:45:16.080 --> 04:45:20.080]  maybe i could find a pbs documentary so i'm click over
[04:45:20.080 --> 04:45:24.080]  the whales are all dying only a global government and carbon tax can save them
[04:45:24.080 --> 04:45:27.280]  oh god let me flip over and then it's some uh
[04:45:27.280 --> 04:45:30.960]  you know program about militias are all over the place they're the terrorists who
[04:45:30.960 --> 04:45:34.160]  want to kill you okay i won't watch that flip over to a
[04:45:34.160 --> 04:45:37.680]  movie and you know it's batman and it's the
[04:45:37.680 --> 04:45:42.640]  joker is putting binary weapons uh into the different cosmetics when combined
[04:45:42.640 --> 04:45:46.400]  that kill the people but he has a cure he'll sell them uh by the way the gulf
[04:45:46.400 --> 04:45:49.200]  of tonkin was staged and i'm like what a weird message
[04:45:49.200 --> 04:45:53.120]  it's you know you flip just everything programming everything throwing at your
[04:45:53.120 --> 04:45:56.960]  face everything mind control and then a caller calls in
[04:45:56.960 --> 04:46:00.640]  a couple days ago on monday it says i saw squid billies
[04:46:00.640 --> 04:46:04.480]  last night i go what's squid billies and they go well it's these red necks so
[04:46:04.480 --> 04:46:07.680]  again the stereotypical thing of anybody in the south so dumb idiot because they're
[04:46:07.680 --> 04:46:09.920]  not domesticated yet hadn't turned all their guns in yet
[04:46:09.920 --> 04:46:13.040]  so they're always the demon the good smart people are in chicago and have
[04:46:13.040 --> 04:46:16.000]  been disarmed and are in new york city and have been domesticated and they're
[04:46:16.000 --> 04:46:18.960]  scared of they see a gun but there are these people that know how to catch fish
[04:46:18.960 --> 04:46:22.160]  know how to skin a deer and and do know how to shoot guns and they're evil
[04:46:22.160 --> 04:46:26.400]  little subhuman squids they have squids mixed in with humans on the show i've
[04:46:26.400 --> 04:46:31.360]  now seen it the message of you are subhuman scum
[04:46:31.360 --> 04:46:34.480]  and they've got different levels of the humanoids down to suboids so the
[04:46:34.480 --> 04:46:38.160]  message is your scum and there's this evil Rockefeller elitist who you know
[04:46:38.160 --> 04:46:42.160]  you hate but he's the one against fluoride so everything's reversed
[04:46:42.160 --> 04:46:46.480]  and the squids it's a long program i ended up watching most of it
[04:46:46.480 --> 04:46:50.960]  this is just a few of the lowlights of it uh there's already this toxic waste
[04:46:50.960 --> 04:46:55.200]  everybody's drinking so they tell you a truth that the
[04:46:55.200 --> 04:46:58.320]  water's full of poison and they're defecating and urinating and putting
[04:46:58.320 --> 04:47:02.080]  poison in it but that's not a problem the fluoride's good for your teeth and
[04:47:02.080 --> 04:47:07.680]  the degenerate redneck squids uh the owner of the town who owns
[04:47:07.680 --> 04:47:10.640]  everything
[04:47:10.640 --> 04:47:16.240]  who basically is is is you know he's a human
[04:47:16.240 --> 04:47:19.440]  and the only person who's good is the cop of course the cop actually wears
[04:47:19.440 --> 04:47:22.160]  clothes and is a god level and it's about four times
[04:47:22.160 --> 04:47:24.960]  bigger than everyone else so the archetypal level is the sweet loving
[04:47:24.960 --> 04:47:28.880]  guy is a cop everyone else is scum and the average humans
[04:47:28.880 --> 04:47:32.400]  who own guns you aren't even humans you're a squid so there's that message
[04:47:32.400 --> 04:47:36.080]  i mean it's just everything is psi op brainwashing every
[04:47:36.080 --> 04:47:39.920]  everything i mean you watch it just thousands of data points for my study
[04:47:39.920 --> 04:47:47.920]  coming in okay and the squids don't want to
[04:47:47.920 --> 04:47:50.960]  well well they don't care about fluoride but the billionaire
[04:47:50.960 --> 04:47:55.360]  decides to tell them that it is a barack hussein obama plan so now if you say
[04:47:55.360 --> 04:47:58.720]  his real name or his his his his full arabic name
[04:47:58.720 --> 04:48:02.240]  which is really the fake name uh you're you're evil
[04:48:02.240 --> 04:48:07.680]  so so they're inoculating you against that there's just so many points here
[04:48:07.680 --> 04:48:10.960]  and he tells them barack hussein obama wants to shrivel your testicles and
[04:48:10.960 --> 04:48:16.160]  sterilize you which in all the studies it massively
[04:48:16.160 --> 04:48:19.840]  reduces the size of your testicles reduces sperm counts and attacks every
[04:48:19.840 --> 04:48:23.600]  organ in the body doubles bone cancer in men and women
[04:48:23.600 --> 04:48:29.680]  quadruples it in men young men uh just you know 90 plus percent of vpa
[04:48:29.680 --> 04:48:32.720]  scientists have had them on the their head toxic
[04:48:32.720 --> 04:48:36.960]  colleges have sent letters saying it's deadly poison if in some towns when they
[04:48:36.960 --> 04:48:40.480]  have droughts they'll feed tap water to cows
[04:48:40.480 --> 04:48:43.280]  they'll water them with it and they most of them die within months all their
[04:48:43.280 --> 04:48:46.640]  hair falls out in australia they've given it to to uh
[04:48:46.640 --> 04:48:49.920]  animals at zoos and they quickly learn to not give them the water
[04:48:49.920 --> 04:48:53.840]  or it kills them i mean i mean you give water to animals it
[04:48:53.840 --> 04:48:57.360]  that has fluoride it kills them
[04:48:58.320 --> 04:49:02.320]  but it doesn't matter see i'm a squid i'm a subhuman piece of trash
[04:49:02.320 --> 04:49:05.760]  it doesn't matter if i have this big giant stack of medical reports and
[04:49:05.760 --> 04:49:09.680]  mainstream information i'm about to cover it doesn't matter the message is
[04:49:09.680 --> 04:49:13.760]  from dr strange love is i'm going to nuke the entire world i'm jack t
[04:49:13.760 --> 04:49:18.560]  repper who wants to nuke everybody uh if i
[04:49:18.560 --> 04:49:22.400]  don't want to drink fluoride you know i'm bad uh look at this colgate
[04:49:22.400 --> 04:49:26.000]  box warnings keep out of reach of children
[04:49:26.000 --> 04:49:30.640]  under the six years of age if more
[04:49:31.680 --> 04:49:36.320]  than a pea size is used in brushing or actually swallowed get medical help
[04:49:36.320 --> 04:49:44.080]  or contact a poison control center right away
[04:49:44.080 --> 04:49:50.800]  uh here's another one but again i'm a subhuman squid because i can read
[04:49:50.800 --> 04:49:55.600]  no the true message is you are a subhuman squid and we're killing your
[04:49:55.600 --> 04:49:59.040]  ass and we're telling you how we're doing it
[04:49:59.040 --> 04:50:04.800]  because we're the elite if more this makes no sense they've changed the
[04:50:04.800 --> 04:50:08.720]  what's on the back i used to say a pea size says keep out of reach of children
[04:50:08.720 --> 04:50:14.240]  under six years of age if more than used for brushing
[04:50:14.240 --> 04:50:17.920]  is accidentally swallowed get medical help or contact a poison control center
[04:50:17.920 --> 04:50:20.880]  right away how bizarre is this there's a typo
[04:50:20.880 --> 04:50:24.720]  on the back of this one and i've read these before so i just added the part
[04:50:24.720 --> 04:50:28.400]  because of the typo where it said if more than a pea size is is ingested
[04:50:28.400 --> 04:50:31.840]  they've taken it out of both colgate and crest
[04:50:31.840 --> 04:50:34.800]  this is a whole nother story we just discovered right here i told you guys go
[04:50:34.800 --> 04:50:37.920]  out and buy me some toothpaste it's always said of more than a pea size is
[04:50:37.920 --> 04:50:40.880]  ingested but they don't like people reading the back we've been telling
[04:50:40.880 --> 04:50:44.480]  them to so suddenly two different companies two different brands
[04:50:44.480 --> 04:50:51.520]  have changed the back to say if more than used for brushing
[04:50:51.520 --> 04:50:54.720]  is accidentally swallowed get medical help or contact poison control right
[04:50:54.720 --> 04:50:57.920]  away that's a scyop we just caught him
[04:50:57.920 --> 04:51:01.120]  right there but i'm not supposed to have analytical thinking skills i'm a
[04:51:01.120 --> 04:51:05.280]  subhuman squid now oh here it is
[04:51:05.280 --> 04:51:11.200]  it's for children fluoride for children you go to the children aisles spring
[04:51:11.200 --> 04:51:14.240]  water with added fluoride for children oh look
[04:51:14.240 --> 04:51:17.120]  for your baby and i've got all the studies where
[04:51:17.120 --> 04:51:21.120]  children ingest fluoride when they're young it has many times the effect as
[04:51:21.120 --> 04:51:24.960]  when you're adults and it says not sterile use is
[04:51:24.960 --> 04:51:30.160]  directed by physician or by label directions for use of an infant
[04:51:30.160 --> 04:51:35.840]  you've got to have a medicalized medical label on water for your baby
[04:51:35.840 --> 04:51:41.680]  added fluoride purified water with fluoride added yum yum
[04:51:41.680 --> 04:51:45.440]  oh look get ready to go to school fluoridated spring water
[04:51:45.440 --> 04:51:52.240]  a big roll out a big and and oh what are the kids watching they're watching
[04:51:52.240 --> 04:51:55.760]  the squid show the squid bellies let's go ahead and play this
[04:51:55.760 --> 04:51:59.120]  total mind control where they then begin shooting
[04:51:59.120 --> 04:52:04.720]  the lake that has the fluoride in it with shotguns
[04:52:04.720 --> 04:52:08.560]  and uh all their teeth then fall out because they don't have the fluoride
[04:52:08.560 --> 04:52:12.880]  isn't that nice here it is
[04:52:12.880 --> 04:52:17.360]  no i'm just performing a routine test to the drinking water
[04:52:17.360 --> 04:52:21.600]  but boy that fluoride's just way off
[04:52:21.600 --> 04:52:25.520]  what's fluoride? hey pause basically that's it in your face
[04:52:25.520 --> 04:52:29.840]  psiop they in fact bring it into me on the rat poison they're throwing rat
[04:52:29.840 --> 04:52:33.760]  poison you know has the mickey mouse ears into the water
[04:52:33.760 --> 04:52:37.840]  and the joke is he says hmm i don't see any fluoride and the squid
[04:52:37.840 --> 04:52:42.640]  throws a big can of rat poison in when all of the old-fashioned rat poisons
[04:52:42.640 --> 04:52:44.880]  are still some of the new ones are rat poison
[04:52:44.880 --> 04:52:49.520]  says rat death so they're letting you know that they know that fluoride is
[04:52:49.520 --> 04:52:52.640]  actually rat poison and then on the back of
[04:52:52.640 --> 04:52:57.520]  in fact google rat poison fluoride box and you can see it
[04:52:57.520 --> 04:53:03.440]  the decon and others they know so they're even saying inside we know it's rat
[04:53:03.440 --> 04:53:08.160]  poison your rat scum ah there's too many of you you're hurting
[04:53:08.160 --> 04:53:11.360]  the earth i'm a control freak i mean that that's what i mean the whole
[04:53:11.360 --> 04:53:14.640]  show is just a big sick joke on everybody so so there it is
[04:53:14.640 --> 04:53:19.120]  oh little message that that's a subliminal oh rat poison
[04:53:19.120 --> 04:53:22.160]  there's different types of subliminals not just the quick flash
[04:53:22.160 --> 04:53:26.160]  or the you know one frame or whatever no no no there's there's the hidden plain
[04:53:26.160 --> 04:53:32.640]  view subliminal oh so uh rat poison in most major types
[04:53:32.640 --> 04:53:36.240]  is poison we always expose it by doing that so they're saying
[04:53:36.240 --> 04:53:40.000]  look we know it's rat poison die die sucker die
[04:53:40.000 --> 04:53:44.240]  the earth belongs to us die die so let's continue
[04:53:44.240 --> 04:53:49.600]  what's all right sir basically rusty is steroids for your teeth make some
[04:53:49.600 --> 04:53:53.120]  strong and hit pause hit pause and mortalize
[04:53:53.120 --> 04:53:57.120]  those have to be a two-part video because i've already done more than 10 minutes
[04:53:57.120 --> 04:54:03.040]  total lies uh the um just google american dental association says don't
[04:54:03.040 --> 04:54:05.840]  give fluoride to children below six because of dental
[04:54:05.840 --> 04:54:10.320]  fluorosis and fractures of the teeth and bones it is now
[04:54:10.320 --> 04:54:14.320]  not supposed to be given to children and now they've changed it i've got to find
[04:54:14.320 --> 04:54:16.640]  an old box used to say now doesn't even make sense
[04:54:16.640 --> 04:54:21.760]  if you ingest a pea size call poison control now it says
[04:54:21.760 --> 04:54:29.520]  if more than used they've taken pea size out if more than used for brushing is
[04:54:29.520 --> 04:54:33.040]  accidentally swallowed get medical help or contact the poison control center
[04:54:33.040 --> 04:54:35.680]  right away two different brands colgate and crest
[04:54:35.680 --> 04:54:39.280]  why am i the only one noticing that they don't have their proper poison control
[04:54:39.280 --> 04:54:42.480]  on see they know you're not paying attention folks and they they just
[04:54:42.480 --> 04:54:48.320]  slept in oh for your children oh no it's an it's a new
[04:54:48.320 --> 04:54:53.120]  water for kids fluoride mommy give it to him yes you like giving a medicine
[04:54:53.120 --> 04:54:58.720]  you're like oh look i've got a indulge sweetener aspartame
[04:54:58.720 --> 04:55:02.960]  the the feces of genetically engineered bacteria
[04:55:02.960 --> 04:55:06.560]  hmm oh yeah that's what it is oh it's just all the
[04:55:06.560 --> 04:55:11.200]  and i order a pizza and the little packet of red pepper comes it says
[04:55:11.200 --> 04:55:15.040]  radiated oh there it is monitoring fluoride in
[04:55:15.040 --> 04:55:18.000]  children parents and other caregivers should traditionally monitor the use of
[04:55:18.000 --> 04:55:21.040]  all fluorid containing dental products by children younger than six
[04:55:21.040 --> 04:55:23.680]  because ingestion of higher than recommended levels of fluoride by
[04:55:23.680 --> 04:55:27.920]  children has been associated with an increased risk of very mild to mild
[04:55:27.920 --> 04:55:31.600]  permanent discoloration and developing oh that's a white wash far worse than
[04:55:31.600 --> 04:55:35.600]  that try to find me the rat poison label
[04:55:35.600 --> 04:55:38.880]  just google rat poison label fluoride it'll come up
[04:55:38.880 --> 04:55:42.880]  i've no i've got it around here and then also you can google um
[04:55:42.880 --> 04:55:46.640]  well it it doesn't anybody can pull it up who wants to okay let's continue we're
[04:55:46.640 --> 04:55:49.760]  only 10 seconds into squid bellies this may take hours but every
[04:55:49.760 --> 04:55:53.200]  five seconds is a brainwashing salvo let's continue
[04:55:53.200 --> 04:55:57.760]  but mr. hayland are you aware that state law requires you to add one part per
[04:55:57.760 --> 04:56:00.560]  million of fluoride let's stop right there you've got a master
[04:56:00.560 --> 04:56:04.320]  controller they're also letting you know who's got a master control computer
[04:56:04.320 --> 04:56:08.800]  with every button being a skull so he's a killer he's evil he's a eugenicist
[04:56:08.800 --> 04:56:12.560]  and he doesn't want you to have fluoride but again
[04:56:12.560 --> 04:56:16.160]  and if you watch it there's other double messages
[04:56:16.160 --> 04:56:21.440]  continue supply yes well i'm sure your precious one ppm is in there somewhere
[04:56:21.440 --> 04:56:24.960]  check again i've checked and double check pause personally
[04:56:24.960 --> 04:56:28.160]  most states do not have a law that you've got to have fluoride
[04:56:28.160 --> 04:56:32.080]  and what what they have is a mandate for federal funds like oh
[04:56:32.080 --> 04:56:38.320]  you want highway funds 55 well i can't drive 55 one foot on the brake one foot
[04:56:38.320 --> 04:56:44.400]  on the gas it's the same thing it's a unfunded mandate
[04:56:44.400 --> 04:56:47.440]  you will put one part per million or you won't get your money
[04:56:47.440 --> 04:56:50.560]  you got edwardsographer cleanest water in america and austin
[04:56:50.560 --> 04:56:54.800]  we're gonna add a bunch of poison in it at the end of the process let's continue
[04:56:54.800 --> 04:56:59.040]  ain't none in there at all i'm going to tackle this issue head on
[04:56:59.040 --> 04:57:03.840]  barack who say no obama is sneaking fluoride
[04:57:03.840 --> 04:57:10.240]  into your drinking water that's right that's right the chemical
[04:57:10.240 --> 04:57:17.360]  fluoride in your drink it was the chemical the chemicals if
[04:57:17.360 --> 04:57:20.400]  i mean fluoride is one of the most deadly chemicals one of the smallest
[04:57:20.400 --> 04:57:24.240]  molecules it's a cumulative poison just co-research it
[04:57:24.240 --> 04:57:29.120]  it's admitted you give it to farm animals they die quickly
[04:57:29.120 --> 04:57:34.880]  you put fish in fluoride water the four they'll die goldfish will die
[04:57:34.880 --> 04:57:38.800]  fish can't live in it it's bad
[04:57:41.440 --> 04:57:45.760]  barack who's saying obama wants to shrink your testicles see it's a big
[04:57:45.760 --> 04:57:50.800]  joke but the idiot squidbillies they listen here we go
[04:57:50.800 --> 04:57:57.280]  to sterilize your testicles we don't need no damn government yours too ladies
[04:57:57.280 --> 04:58:00.720]  it pause they want we don't need no damn government
[04:58:00.720 --> 04:58:04.640]  now if you want don't want them force medicating you
[04:58:04.640 --> 04:58:08.000]  you don't want no damn government
[04:58:08.480 --> 04:58:13.760]  see the message is you are totally anti-government and you want zero
[04:58:13.760 --> 04:58:17.280]  government if you don't want them putting over 300 chemicals on average
[04:58:17.280 --> 04:58:20.320]  it's about 150 under the name fluoride they can
[04:58:20.320 --> 04:58:23.440]  dump a whole bunch of toxic waste where do you think toxic waste from aluminum
[04:58:23.440 --> 04:58:26.640]  production nuclear weapons of fuel rod production
[04:58:26.640 --> 04:58:30.480]  and fertilizer mines comes from that's what austin gets it from a fertilizer
[04:58:30.480 --> 04:58:34.320]  mine the byproduct of the chemical waste because
[04:58:34.320 --> 04:58:38.080]  they mine limestone for the base product for the type we use
[04:58:38.080 --> 04:58:42.080]  side issue the point is go do some research i don't want no damn government
[04:58:42.080 --> 04:58:48.000]  i don't want no damn government let's continue to abort your thinking breathing
[04:58:48.000 --> 04:58:52.320]  sperm this is unacceptable to us now in fact back
[04:58:52.320 --> 04:58:56.640]  it up 20 seconds see now your sperm are thinking and breathing they mix real
[04:58:56.640 --> 04:58:58.960]  information that it does shrink your testicles
[04:58:58.960 --> 04:59:04.160]  does reduce sperm count does attack every organ in the body
[04:59:04.160 --> 04:59:07.120]  on record how many scientists have we had on
[04:59:07.120 --> 04:59:11.040]  head toxicologist EPA they wanted out government says no
[04:59:11.040 --> 04:59:14.400]  but they give you some weird guy with orange hair who's naked
[04:59:14.400 --> 04:59:18.400]  up there to discredit it but then the cop he's well spoken and sweet and has a
[04:59:18.400 --> 04:59:21.840]  gun the symbol of authority he's four or five times bigger than everybody else
[04:59:21.840 --> 04:59:26.800]  the images he's the mommy he's the cop he's going to give you the fluoride
[04:59:26.800 --> 04:59:30.240]  he lovingly helps them keep their teeth at the end
[04:59:30.240 --> 04:59:34.240]  everyone's scumbag him let's go ahead back to the brainwashing
[04:59:34.240 --> 04:59:40.720]  into your drinking water that's right that's right the chemical
[04:59:40.720 --> 04:59:47.680]  fluoride in your drinking water to sterilize your testicles we don't need
[04:59:47.680 --> 04:59:53.280]  no damn government yours too ladies they want to abort your
[04:59:53.280 --> 04:59:57.360]  thinking breathing sperm this is unacceptable to what that is
[04:59:57.360 --> 05:00:00.880]  i don't accept this no fly where's that water
[05:00:00.880 --> 05:00:04.240]  out there's water i mean i don't bother me
[05:00:04.240 --> 05:00:09.760]  head pause you're a subhuman squid if you have a shotgun
[05:00:09.760 --> 05:00:14.160]  this is domestication i imagine we're pointing out that they're poisoning our
[05:00:14.160 --> 05:00:17.280]  water that brain damages us and reduces fertility
[05:00:17.280 --> 05:00:21.200]  and they've got shows where subhuman squids are running around waving shotguns
[05:00:21.200 --> 05:00:24.000]  who are against it oh you don't want socials health
[05:00:24.000 --> 05:00:26.640]  care you're a racist oh you don't want world
[05:00:26.640 --> 05:00:31.120]  government you want to kill cops no evidence they just say it
[05:00:31.120 --> 05:00:35.040]  now does that not tell you how creepy and evil these people are
[05:00:35.040 --> 05:00:48.400]  continue
[05:00:48.400 --> 05:00:54.880]  i know let's freeze some and then we can smash it
[05:00:54.880 --> 05:00:58.800]  then we'll wait until winter
[05:00:58.800 --> 05:01:05.040]  i hit pause they know the average lazy person they've done psychological brain
[05:01:05.040 --> 05:01:07.520]  algorithm studies this is admitted DARPA just
[05:01:07.520 --> 05:01:10.880]  i've been to the ut psychology department the vast majority of it is just
[05:01:10.880 --> 05:01:14.240]  flicker rates of the eye what is interesting to you how to make you
[05:01:14.240 --> 05:01:17.200]  upset how to create a bad response and they found with lazy
[05:01:17.200 --> 05:01:20.880]  jellyfish in fact here it is about me all about me
[05:01:20.880 --> 05:01:24.480]  college kids lack empathy compared to 30 years ago it's all about me now
[05:01:24.480 --> 05:01:27.680]  which means nobody cares about them so you're all alone isolated
[05:01:27.680 --> 05:01:31.440]  so the predator class can corner you at their will
[05:01:31.440 --> 05:01:37.440]  they know no one hates waiting and so that that clicks a nerve
[05:01:37.440 --> 05:01:40.240]  in the brain okay we're going to wait till winter
[05:01:40.240 --> 05:01:44.640]  and so the average person then has a subconscious psychological
[05:01:44.640 --> 05:01:49.920]  uh neuron trigger uh in you know in their little dreamlike state watching
[05:01:49.920 --> 05:01:52.480]  television which actually puts in dreamlike state that's on record more
[05:01:52.480 --> 05:01:54.640]  than just a few minutes of people that watch a lot of tv they go into the
[05:01:54.640 --> 05:01:57.360]  dreamlike state notice i'm not in the dreamlike state folks i don't watch
[05:01:57.360 --> 05:02:00.000]  much tv uh you know this how you're supposed to work
[05:02:00.000 --> 05:02:02.880]  you know fast intelligent dynamic understanding connections
[05:02:02.880 --> 05:02:07.280]  you're on florida watch tv all day four and a half hours on average
[05:02:07.280 --> 05:02:11.520]  they know that well that they trigger oh my god they're there watching
[05:02:11.520 --> 05:02:15.040]  waiting till winter this is boring and they know watching the show that makes
[05:02:15.040 --> 05:02:18.400]  you hate them you want to see the little squids that look subhuman
[05:02:18.400 --> 05:02:21.280]  that make you feel good about yourself not knowing that the jokes on you that
[05:02:21.280 --> 05:02:24.960]  you're the squid you want to see them go do something else stupid or get hurt
[05:02:24.960 --> 05:02:28.000]  which makes you feel big and powerful over the subhuman squids which is you
[05:02:28.000 --> 05:02:31.840]  according to the elite so the jokes on you on top of it jokes within jokes
[05:02:31.840 --> 05:02:35.760]  and so uh this is all psych warfare pentagon probably wrote that up
[05:02:35.760 --> 05:02:39.920]  and so you're there and you're watching this and oh god they're gonna wait till
[05:02:39.920 --> 05:02:43.280]  winter now that makes you have disdain for them
[05:02:43.280 --> 05:02:47.040]  it makes you angry for at them it makes you not like them
[05:02:47.040 --> 05:02:50.240]  so you're just taught to hate them just another every second is programming
[05:02:50.240 --> 05:02:55.120]  let's continue global warming and your impact on the environment
[05:02:55.120 --> 05:02:58.560]  all right hit pause again back it up every two three seconds
[05:02:58.560 --> 05:03:02.080]  is just the and this goes on for 30 minutes okay
[05:03:02.080 --> 05:03:09.440]  he's hitting the water because global warming
[05:03:11.120 --> 05:03:16.560]  i mean again just selling global warming it is just it is total
[05:03:16.560 --> 05:03:20.560]  mind control continue hey you do know the fluoride's already out of the water
[05:03:20.560 --> 05:03:24.000]  don't you well that might be true yeah hey daddy my
[05:03:24.000 --> 05:03:28.000]  my teeth are getting all loose they're moving around in my mouth and everything

[05:03:37.840 --> 05:03:43.040]  scum southern american jellyfish who wants to go to washington being
[05:03:43.040 --> 05:03:48.240]  involved means you have no teeth and are scum and the cops looking over him

[05:03:52.320 --> 05:03:56.400]  but again back it up to the earlier global warming part back at about 20
[05:03:56.400 --> 05:03:59.280]  seconds here just again every three four seconds total
[05:03:59.280 --> 05:04:03.520]  programming continue damn you global warming and your impact on the
[05:04:03.520 --> 05:04:08.240]  environment early you do know the fluoride's already
[05:04:08.240 --> 05:04:10.800]  out of the water don't you well that might be true

[05:04:43.600 --> 05:04:47.360]  no you don't have any real reasons to complain you toothless
[05:04:47.360 --> 05:04:52.640]  jellyfish piece of subhuman trash and now you're gonna complain because you
[05:04:52.640 --> 05:04:55.680]  didn't do what the government said and drink your fluoride

[05:05:06.240 --> 05:05:10.720]  again the top Rockefeller globalist who scams everyone
[05:05:10.720 --> 05:05:14.400]  everyone's teeth have fallen out now he's gonna sell them the prosthesis
[05:05:14.400 --> 05:05:17.280]  the dentures which is what the globalists actually do

[05:06:41.440 --> 05:06:45.280]  lookout for the gummies rewind it again uh-huh this is key i want
[05:06:45.280 --> 05:06:51.040]  now here you see the police officer and he's got the fluoride he knows better
[05:06:51.040 --> 05:06:54.080]  than your dad just like the schools i've got time
[05:06:54.080 --> 05:06:57.120]  magazine for kids five years ago saying your parents
[05:06:57.120 --> 05:07:00.880]  are part of an old foolish age you can pull up the actual quotes it's even
[05:07:00.880 --> 05:07:03.440]  worse and they don't understand that you'll all
[05:07:03.440 --> 05:07:06.640]  have implantable microchips you belong to a new wonderful future
[05:07:06.640 --> 05:07:11.200]  it's like sarcastic it's it's it's absurdist over the top
[05:07:11.200 --> 05:07:15.200]  i saw a CNN clip yesterday we may put a clip up in the film where they're like
[05:07:15.200 --> 05:07:18.640]  it's good to have the government secretly take your child's blood at birth
[05:07:18.640 --> 05:07:22.400]  only extremists don't like it see it's just more and more crazy
[05:07:22.400 --> 05:07:26.080]  yeah we're recording your naked bodies at the airport what's wrong with that
[05:07:26.080 --> 05:07:30.480]  you don't like it so again the good officer comes out and they try to steal
[05:07:30.480 --> 05:07:34.480]  his one little tooth again they know that everybody has a
[05:07:34.480 --> 05:07:37.520]  subconscious one of the most common dreams is of losing your teeth it's an
[05:07:37.520 --> 05:07:41.520]  archetype of the growing old and dying and so they know people have a fear of
[05:07:41.520 --> 05:07:44.320]  losing their teeth and so they show the evil father
[05:07:44.320 --> 05:07:48.560]  and others trying to rip out his son's final tooth
[05:07:48.560 --> 05:07:52.560]  and but but the police officer stops it let's continue the family's
[05:07:52.560 --> 05:07:55.520]  either i like the way the tiny food bits mix
[05:07:55.520 --> 05:08:01.280]  with my spit hey rasta over here
[05:08:01.280 --> 05:08:05.440]  that smuggle is in for you so brush up me and the boys and keep a look out for
[05:08:05.440 --> 05:08:09.680]  the gummies uh-huh you sneaky devils goons
[05:08:09.680 --> 05:08:19.520]  search their lips so the cops secretly gets the kid under his control
[05:08:19.520 --> 05:08:23.680]  but then they want to pull his tooth out uh and then the local rockerfeller comes
[05:08:23.680 --> 05:08:26.720]  with vigilantes the rockerfeller would come with the cops
