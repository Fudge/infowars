[00:00.000 --> 00:13.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:13.040 --> 00:21.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:21.840 --> 00:32.240]  well just a few minutes ago the Rosetta mission was successful launching its
[00:32.240 --> 00:39.840]  probe to the surface of a fast 34,000 mile an hour moving comet the European
[00:39.840 --> 00:47.080]  Space Agency congratulations to humanity on true trailblazing very very
[00:47.080 --> 00:50.560]  exciting we're gonna play some of that celebration coming up the start of the
[00:50.560 --> 00:58.240]  next segment Europe makes space history as the Rosetta mission launching I have
[00:58.240 --> 01:05.960]  trouble pronouncing this some say filet filet probe lands on comet
[01:05.960 --> 01:11.600]  pretty exciting stuff an amazing video some of the first images or snapshots
[01:11.600 --> 01:15.120]  have gotten back we'll have some of those on screen you go to drudgereport.com
[01:15.120 --> 01:24.440]  it's the top image on the site you can see the touchdown taking place right
[01:24.440 --> 01:34.840]  there with the overall mission extremely extremely exciting to see that happen in
[01:34.840 --> 01:39.960]  amongst all the other crazy news that we've got here in front of us the bad
[01:39.960 --> 01:52.760]  news is back here on earth we are being pirated by the globalists that now want
[01:52.760 --> 01:58.520]  to take over the internet and and loot that and tax that to quote protect the
[01:58.520 --> 02:06.240]  public utility and now CBS News reports people are going to be in for a shock
[02:06.240 --> 02:14.840]  penalty for uninsured not signing up for Obamacare to more than triple more than
[02:14.840 --> 02:22.640]  triple so it's not gonna be $5,000 a year it's gonna be upwards of even more
[02:22.640 --> 02:29.520]  than that for for families and it's just the beginning but they'll make you feel
[02:29.520 --> 02:33.000]  isolated and alone they'll tell you it's not happening you'll hold up your
[02:33.000 --> 02:37.320]  Humana bill in Texas that's 530 something percent increase and they'll
[02:37.320 --> 02:43.960]  just say shut up it doesn't exist we control reality dumb American you know
[02:43.960 --> 02:47.640]  if they catch all these Democrats and professors calling us dumb Americans
[02:47.640 --> 02:57.040]  who are they and I guess America really is a joke and we are dumb if they sit up
[02:57.040 --> 03:01.560]  there and screw us publicly and then laugh at us in our face and we just love
[03:01.560 --> 03:08.840]  it but see most Americans won't see that professor in now two videos a new
[03:08.840 --> 03:12.600]  video service we're gonna play that in a moment because that's academic stuff they
[03:12.600 --> 03:16.120]  know you don't watch c-span they know you don't watch university channels so when
[03:16.120 --> 03:20.120]  it did go viral they said Fox News and others you don't air that but it's
[03:20.120 --> 03:29.320]  clearly fair use so see they love to brag in their own conferences because they
[03:29.320 --> 03:37.640]  know the average person is watching Disney television or the NFL on ESPN but
[03:37.640 --> 03:42.240]  now it's in Forbes after we reported on it after drudge carried stories on it
[03:42.240 --> 03:46.440]  see I just love how info wars.com drudgereport.com Whirlanddaily.com
[03:46.440 --> 03:52.640]  continues to just force these stories out the stupidity of the American voter
[03:52.640 --> 04:01.720]  led us to hide Obamacare's true cross from the public now that's kind of a
[04:01.720 --> 04:04.640]  twisting there that's quotes out of context what did they read what he said
[04:04.640 --> 04:11.040]  was the public stupid so we we hid it from them and we're counting on them
[04:11.040 --> 04:15.240]  being stupid that's how we got it done I said that's clearly the inference that's
[04:15.240 --> 04:21.520]  being made there not oh you're too stupid so we hid the fact that it's a big
[04:21.520 --> 04:25.680]  ripoff from you know it's a big ripoff and we hit it and counting on that in
[04:25.680 --> 04:28.880]  the stupidities how we got the ball across the finish line that's what he
[04:28.880 --> 04:32.280]  said we're gonna play the original clip and then the new clip when he's talking
[04:32.280 --> 04:40.120]  to his students college kids they're not kids people used to you know carry out
[04:40.120 --> 04:45.120]  trade missions when they were 15 years old kids used to walk halfway across the

[08:52.960 --> 09:10.480]  i know it's not a touchdown in a football game but it's events like this
[09:10.480 --> 09:13.760]  that are the future of humanity we're going to survive and make it very
[09:13.760 --> 09:19.040]  exciting and yes these tenuous steps look shaky at this point but then they
[09:19.040 --> 09:23.280]  will start to get bigger and bigger and accelerate exponentially
[09:23.280 --> 09:30.640]  there's also a serious danger though the new york times has come out
[09:30.640 --> 09:37.520]  and admitted that top scientists and futurists are really worried about a
[09:37.520 --> 09:43.840]  robot arms race with autonomous self-aware robots you need to understand
[09:43.840 --> 09:51.040]  that the british drone and the united the u.s. drones that they're deploying
[09:51.040 --> 09:55.040]  one of the british drones is called tyranny but they spin it and say that
[09:55.040 --> 09:59.520]  that's a gaelic word but no it's meant to be tyrannous
[09:59.520 --> 10:03.360]  and there it is a fearing bombs that can pick whom to kill
[10:03.360 --> 10:06.800]  i'm here to announce to you they had autonomous drones
[10:06.800 --> 10:10.880]  in orbit at least ten years ago they had radio controlled
[10:10.880 --> 10:16.240]  and satellite controlled space planes up in the late 70s
[10:16.240 --> 10:18.960]  and i was told that by the former head of star wars
[10:18.960 --> 10:23.200]  dr bob bowman who was on record the head of star wars
[10:23.200 --> 10:26.560]  when it was classified it didn't get founded by reagan
[10:26.560 --> 10:30.480]  uh sdi in the 80s it was already there in the pentagon
[10:30.480 --> 10:34.880]  obviously that's been declassified but they had
[10:34.880 --> 10:41.440]  aircraft in orbit with du sabos which don't have a nuclear explosion but they
[10:41.440 --> 10:44.800]  have the same kinetic energy as a low yield nuclear weapon to even be able to
[10:44.800 --> 10:48.960]  kill people six miles under a mountain
[10:48.960 --> 10:51.520]  you cannot have people six miles under sea level
[10:51.520 --> 10:57.200]  because it's 150 200 degrees under a mountain under a six mile mountain
[10:57.200 --> 11:02.080]  it's about 65 degrees and these are weapons that will destroy whole
[11:02.080 --> 11:05.200]  mountains and super deep underground bases
[11:05.200 --> 11:10.240]  now they had those by 79 operational the only reason he could tell me that was
[11:10.240 --> 11:13.760]  because they had accidentally
[11:13.920 --> 11:17.600]  in some declassifications released some of that
[11:17.600 --> 11:20.560]  now they're also reporting in the washington post
[11:20.560 --> 11:24.160]  the pentagon wants an airborne aircraft carrier to launch drones
[11:24.160 --> 11:29.040]  i told you everything in captain america is a revelation of the method
[11:29.040 --> 11:33.920]  where they have these big floating aircraft carriers that launch drones
[11:33.920 --> 11:37.600]  that use face scanning and heat resonance off the top of your head and
[11:37.600 --> 11:42.240]  shoulders to 100 id you and then kill you with
[11:42.240 --> 11:45.840]  microwave particle beams
[11:46.160 --> 11:50.240]  in the movie it stylized with laser cannons that's not how it works
[11:50.240 --> 11:53.280]  they just fry you while you're asleep in your home and they're not going to have
[11:53.280 --> 11:56.720]  floating aircraft carriers alexander haig owned the company
[11:56.720 --> 12:01.200]  launched it in 1991 and had secret operational blimps
[12:01.200 --> 12:07.520]  above the planet at over 130 000 feet by the year 2001 they were declassified
[12:07.520 --> 12:11.840]  of course about five years ago not what is on board the craft
[12:11.840 --> 12:15.280]  again everything i'm giving you is super top secret and i have it from the
[12:15.280 --> 12:18.320]  sources and you've noticed it's all been confirmed
[12:18.320 --> 12:22.400]  there are hundreds of small blimps in
[12:22.400 --> 12:28.480]  edge of space orbit and reportedly quite a few of the big ones
[12:28.560 --> 12:32.800]  but again we did a review of captain america i told you they were actually
[12:32.800 --> 12:36.640]  developing these now it's been announced so there you have it
[12:36.640 --> 12:40.560]  but it will not look like the classic aircraft carrier in the ocean
[12:40.560 --> 12:46.000]  flying around like captain america they're just giant blimp bases
[12:46.000 --> 12:51.680]  and huge equivalent of c 130 to launch smaller drone clusters
[12:51.680 --> 12:55.360]  but the blimps are in the edge of space
[12:55.360 --> 12:58.800]  basic orbit where there's really not any wind and the and their whole
[12:58.800 --> 13:02.640]  tops are solar powered and then they have
[13:02.640 --> 13:05.680]  other crafts that will go up other delivery blimps
[13:05.680 --> 13:09.440]  that will then deliver resupply missions to these
[13:09.440 --> 13:15.280]  command bases now a lot of this isn't even classified alexander haig
[13:15.280 --> 13:19.920]  had a tv show that for some reason was on austin cable was on nationwide most
[13:19.920 --> 13:23.760]  areas and i would get home after working out at like six at night
[13:23.760 --> 13:27.760]  after high school and i i would religiously watch it because
[13:27.760 --> 13:31.440]  it was incredible as haig up there going well have these low earth orbit
[13:31.440 --> 13:34.080]  systems and all the communications will be on them will also be able to
[13:34.080 --> 13:37.600]  surveil whoever and kill whoever's a threat to the republic
[13:37.600 --> 13:42.240]  and uh he's the guy that whenever reagan was shot he ran out and said i am in
[13:42.240 --> 13:45.760]  command i am in control here i mean these people are
[13:45.760 --> 13:50.800]  wild and he of course is dead now you can look up his tv show we ought to find i
[13:50.800 --> 13:53.280]  bet there's archives of that you can get
[13:53.280 --> 13:56.720]  and we ought to find the episode on his blimp company
[13:56.720 --> 14:00.880]  because he's the guy that launched the whole blimp deal okay let's just get off
[14:00.880 --> 14:03.920]  that because i got a lot of important news to get to i start talking about the
[14:03.920 --> 14:08.400]  spacecraft landing and the rosetta
[14:08.400 --> 14:16.640]  main ship launching the phylai rosetta probe touches down on speeding comment
[14:16.640 --> 14:20.480]  the rosetta mission has successfully landed a probe on a comet moving more
[14:20.480 --> 14:25.680]  than 35 000 miles an hour in a historic first for space exploration
[14:25.680 --> 14:30.160]  scientists cheered and punched the air in the european space agency control room
[14:30.160 --> 14:35.440]  when they received confirmation that the lander was sending signals from the
[14:35.440 --> 14:41.520]  comet esa director general john jox
[14:41.520 --> 14:47.280]  door dordane i think told a delighted audience this is a big step for human
[14:47.280 --> 14:50.080]  civilization that's right that's what we want there's a real
[14:50.080 --> 14:54.880]  fight in government right now about whether we should explore do anything
[14:54.880 --> 14:59.680]  you notice this is an unmanned probe but you have to at this level
[14:59.680 --> 15:04.560]  i'm all for computers robots probes helping us assisting us but we have to
[15:04.560 --> 15:09.280]  build it all for us and where it's controlled by the people and
[15:09.280 --> 15:12.400]  transparent you don't you will be taken over
[15:12.400 --> 15:16.480]  every futurist every top engineer the inventor of the internet
[15:16.480 --> 15:20.720]  all of them are on record just google scientists warn of rising machines and
[15:20.720 --> 15:24.160]  they all say we've had robotics professors all of them on
[15:24.160 --> 15:28.240]  they will take over because look it's being designed by humans
[15:28.240 --> 15:34.000]  from the beginning to oppress so the very circuitry the very missions the
[15:34.000 --> 15:39.280]  very system is going for ai so that humans
[15:39.280 --> 15:43.440]  don't even make the decision to have the kills why is that
[15:43.440 --> 15:46.960]  because the globalists want to be able to have a drone army attack the republic
[15:46.960 --> 15:50.720]  or anybody else they want or go kill you and your family
[15:50.720 --> 15:55.520]  and then go and self-destruct and blame somebody else basically
[15:56.400 --> 16:00.320]  and the robots that they show us at mit are tanker toys
[16:00.320 --> 16:03.200]  compared to what the marines and others really have you're seeing 20
[16:03.200 --> 16:06.480]  30-year-old stuff that they let some graduate students
[16:06.480 --> 16:10.880]  oh here's some plans see if you can build this and it's all part of a front
[16:10.880 --> 16:17.760]  just like the space shuttle a 1934 design by verna von bran
[16:18.400 --> 16:22.320]  was just a public resupply truck tinker toy
[16:22.320 --> 16:26.320]  to show everybody while the real space program goes on
[16:26.320 --> 16:31.920]  and that may admit about 80 percent of the space program is classified
[16:31.920 --> 16:34.720]  you see that space plane they've now been showing the public
[16:34.720 --> 16:40.080]  looks like a small space shuttle yeah that thing's at least 40 years old
[16:40.080 --> 16:44.320]  that's what some of the first space planes look like uh decades and decades
[16:44.320 --> 16:47.760]  and decades before or even shown them and they admit this like the b2
[16:47.760 --> 16:50.160]  bomber they admit was in service for 20 years
[16:50.160 --> 16:53.760]  before you were told about it that's very old technology
[16:53.760 --> 16:57.600]  my dad when he was a kid uh would you know see that stuff flying over all the
[16:57.600 --> 17:02.560]  time uh when i was a kid we were uh driving home from grandma's at the
[17:02.560 --> 17:06.160]  ranch back to dallas and saw three of the stealth
[17:06.160 --> 17:08.960]  fighters and it is the stealth fighter you see
[17:08.960 --> 17:12.720]  but they were gray green flying at about 200 feet over cow pastures
[17:12.720 --> 17:15.520]  and they weren't even going fast i was like wow look at that
[17:15.520 --> 17:19.920]  and and it was just like i like star wars and that had just been out a few
[17:19.920 --> 17:25.520]  years and i thought man space ships my dad goes no secret aircraft
[17:25.520 --> 17:31.520]  so my dad saw stealth bomber fly over the ranch when he was like 10 years old
[17:31.520 --> 17:35.920]  that'd be 1960 and of course they declassified a few years
[17:35.920 --> 17:40.560]  ago that indeed they did have the bat wing or the boomerang shaped uh
[17:40.560 --> 17:44.320]  typecraft in the 60s so there you go but i don't want to digress anymore we've
[17:44.320 --> 17:47.920]  got really serious important news to cover but i tend to get off of the
[17:47.920 --> 17:51.200]  scientific stuff when we see amazing things like what just happened with the
[17:51.200 --> 17:54.960]  rosetta mission a big success look for images video
[17:54.960 --> 17:58.240]  more to be coming back from that learning about the nature of the universe
[17:58.240 --> 18:02.800]  new elements uh who knows what'll be discovered as it begins to drill in and
[18:02.800 --> 18:06.800]  mine data out of that out of that
[18:06.800 --> 18:13.440]  kuiper belt remnant that has been hurtled towards the sun
[18:13.440 --> 18:17.360]  now that said when we come back from break
[18:17.760 --> 18:23.840]  this is in the london guardian now we reported on this uh this latest round a
[18:23.840 --> 18:27.360]  few years ago not bragging just let you know
[18:27.360 --> 18:31.360]  again we're proving right john raport ported on it a few days ago
[18:31.360 --> 18:36.160]  the latest india mass sterilization women were forced into camps
[18:36.160 --> 18:41.280]  that's the london guardian and this has been going on by the millions for decades
[18:41.280 --> 18:45.920]  it's even been passed by the parliament over there uh to do this
[18:45.920 --> 18:51.440]  uh and they just act like in the west oh we don't know what's going on with the
[18:51.440 --> 18:54.720]  chinese mobile execution vans oh we don't know what's going on with the
[18:54.720 --> 19:00.240]  tetanus shots this is why uh you don't
[19:00.240 --> 19:04.960]  take this is the reason you don't take vaccines
[19:04.960 --> 19:09.040]  it's because it's social engineering they're putting things that reduce your
[19:09.040 --> 19:11.920]  fertility in them here on record because it'll be too obvious if
[19:11.920 --> 19:14.880]  everybody's sterilized they're putting stuff in latin america
[19:14.880 --> 19:19.840]  africa and asia that sometimes kills the women but sterilizes them
[19:19.840 --> 19:23.200]  and see that's the thing if it's powerful enough to destroy your fertility
[19:23.200 --> 19:27.680]  it's killing a lot of these women and there's video interviews with them
[19:27.680 --> 19:32.240]  i mean i remember 64 thousand kids got paralyzed i think three thousand died
[19:32.240 --> 19:36.480]  in one round of billa melinda gates vaccines two years ago there
[19:36.480 --> 19:39.200]  when they pull up with the armored trucks at the villages and the troops
[19:39.200 --> 19:43.040]  jump out with the shots and the un people the villagers run all over the
[19:43.040 --> 19:46.320]  world 50 years ago when they still trusted the white
[19:46.320 --> 19:50.400]  medicine man they'd run up and beg for it because back then they weren't really
[19:50.400 --> 19:52.720]  doing this it was a bunch of bleeding heart christian

[24:15.120 --> 24:22.320]  you want answers well so does he live from Austin Texas broadcasting
[24:22.320 --> 24:29.360]  worldwide it's alex jones
[24:29.360 --> 24:33.440]  see what government does is they play dumb when finally you've got
[24:33.440 --> 24:37.920]  tens of thousands of women a week getting sterilized hundreds of dying
[24:37.920 --> 24:43.520]  because the chemical and bio weapons are so powerful it kills them as well
[24:43.520 --> 24:48.640]  in africa in india in asia then the media will go well there is a government
[24:48.640 --> 24:52.080]  program india used to do that but they're not supposed to anymore go
[24:52.080 --> 24:53.920]  around with these health department vans and
[24:53.920 --> 24:58.960]  grab the women and then so many people will say well alex
[24:58.960 --> 25:02.000]  there are too many indians i mean come on you say don't open the borders up it
[25:02.000 --> 25:05.040]  will drive down the wages but we got to get rid of these people and it's
[25:05.040 --> 25:09.760]  always the liberal trendy don't you understand liberal trendy
[25:09.760 --> 25:14.400]  they're doing it to you too stupid they don't care if you're black or white or
[25:14.400 --> 25:17.520]  hispanic or asian or indian they will give you
[25:17.520 --> 25:22.080]  50-something shots by 18 months and boys don't have as tough a blood brain
[25:22.080 --> 25:25.760]  barrier and that's why every town's got warehouses
[25:25.760 --> 25:30.640]  of people in diapers when they're 30 years old
[25:30.640 --> 25:35.040]  now that's a premeditated plan to dumb people down
[25:35.040 --> 25:39.760]  to make us more manageable and in a certain percentage it overdoes it
[25:39.760 --> 25:43.840]  and so you get seriously brain damaged people so we can be managed we can be
[25:43.840 --> 25:48.560]  stupid like they brag and the fluoride and the gmo's
[25:48.560 --> 25:51.600]  that kill the rats that eat it and the honeybees that eat it
[25:51.600 --> 25:55.360]  i'm gonna say that again the bt corn kills rats
[25:55.360 --> 26:00.960]  it kills honeybees organ failure in the rats by the third generation every rat
[26:00.960 --> 26:06.240]  species every rodent species from guinea pigs to lab mice
[26:06.240 --> 26:11.440]  are 98 percent sterile with testicles growing out of their heads or arms
[26:11.440 --> 26:14.640]  stuff like that hair growing out of their mouths want me to show tv viewers the
[26:14.640 --> 26:19.920]  photos just type in gmo uh rodentumbers it's all
[26:19.920 --> 26:24.640]  being done you understand we're only one generation
[26:24.640 --> 26:30.080]  into gmo right now and the killing fields are massive
[26:30.080 --> 26:35.040]  and i'm sorry the transmission is a little too hard core for you
[26:35.040 --> 26:38.560]  but that's reality so we're going to play leon macadoo's report and then we're
[26:38.560 --> 26:45.280]  going to get in to the guy that calls this mr stupid
[26:45.280 --> 26:49.520]  yeah type in rodents gmo or guinea pigs hair and mouth
[26:49.520 --> 26:52.960]  testicles uh and it'll have it growing out of their heads and stuff or out of
[26:52.960 --> 26:56.320]  their mouths and it's all funny to the globalist
[26:56.320 --> 27:01.280]  now one generation's about to start having the next show will go from
[27:01.280 --> 27:04.640]  you know 10 percent of the kids being autistic or having disorders till you're
[27:04.640 --> 27:07.680]  30 40 and then it'll just be everybody sterile or dying
[27:07.680 --> 27:11.440]  but by then all the robots will be patrolling and already africa would
[27:11.440 --> 27:14.400]  have been wiped out asian been pretty much wiped out
[27:14.400 --> 27:18.160]  you'll just see how it all happens because the globalist wrote books see i
[27:18.160 --> 27:21.040]  read them i read the books i read what rake
[27:21.040 --> 27:24.000]  urswell said i i read what john p holdren and
[27:24.000 --> 27:28.640]  and and urlick paul urlick wrote see i i read the club of rome
[27:28.640 --> 27:32.320]  1960s documents and showed him to you and read the quotes on here see they said
[27:32.320 --> 27:35.360]  they had a plan but we were too stupid to listen
[27:35.360 --> 27:43.600]  just like just like uh we have uh the obama care architect
[27:43.600 --> 27:46.080]  gruber
[27:46.720 --> 27:50.960]  going on msnbc yesterday and saying i didn't mean it was off the cuff
[27:50.960 --> 27:55.920]  i'm afraid we have him to his students telling him the same thing
[27:55.920 --> 28:00.080]  no sir the whole plan has been deceptive and it's meant to increase prices and
[28:00.080 --> 28:03.520]  it's meant to bankrupt people and it's meant to have death panels and it and
[28:03.520 --> 28:05.360]  we've got bill gates i want to special report
[28:05.360 --> 28:09.280]  that let's get bill gates on death panels ready for the next segment too
[28:09.280 --> 28:12.800]  and let's get uh the man or the one one of the other big architects
[28:12.800 --> 28:16.960]  azika lemanuel on who's an open eugenicist and an open exterminist and
[28:16.960 --> 28:20.800]  says reduce population kill the old people you know kill babies if you want
[28:20.800 --> 28:23.600]  to after they're born i mean this is all being sold
[28:23.600 --> 28:27.360]  i can go to ut right now and about 45 percent of the people we talked to we've
[28:27.360 --> 28:31.120]  done it twice and each time it's 45 roughly almost half
[28:31.120 --> 28:35.360]  say yes let people kill kids up to age five
[28:35.360 --> 28:38.240]  and we say seriously yeah if it's my choice i want to kill my kid it's all
[28:38.240 --> 28:42.080]  about me me me and do a powerless chicken neck
[28:42.080 --> 28:46.160]  coward who can't even tie their shoelaces and plays video games all day
[28:46.160 --> 28:49.680]  and goes and sits and hears some professor teaching about an obsolete
[28:49.680 --> 28:52.720]  future they're not even gonna have
[28:52.720 --> 28:56.720]  when you've got stuff like that going on ladies and gentlemen
[28:56.720 --> 29:00.320]  the weaker people are the more demonic they are i found the more
[29:00.320 --> 29:05.200]  the more they like the sound of something wicked they worship at the feet of it
[29:05.200 --> 29:09.040]  and don't worry you're gonna get everything you want all you servants of

[29:33.840 --> 29:36.800]  had to hide the money the increased prices but you know
[29:36.800 --> 29:39.840]  adding that to their stupidity we got it through and they're all laughing the

[33:09.440 --> 33:23.520]  alex jones and the gcm radio network
[33:23.520 --> 33:28.320]  united nations organizations are charged with sterilizing millions of girls and
[33:28.320 --> 33:32.160]  women under cover of an anti tetanus vaccine program
[33:32.160 --> 33:36.480]  sponsored by the kenyan government the population control scheme was exposed
[33:36.480 --> 33:40.640]  after the kenya catholic doctors association sent six samples of the
[33:40.640 --> 33:43.520]  tetanus vaccine that was used during the world health
[33:43.520 --> 33:48.000]  organizations immunization campaign this year to laboratories in south africa
[33:48.000 --> 33:51.520]  for testing according to the doctors all samples tested
[33:51.520 --> 33:57.440]  positive for the hcg antigen hcg mimics a natural hormone that's
[33:57.440 --> 34:00.800]  produced by pregnant women well the bishops and doctors warn that
[34:00.800 --> 34:06.080]  injecting women with hcg actually causes them to develop antibodies against it
[34:06.080 --> 34:10.000]  when they do get pregnant and produce their own version of hcg
[34:10.000 --> 34:13.200]  it triggers the production of antibodies that cause
[34:13.200 --> 34:16.880]  miscarriages the doctors said this proved right
[34:16.880 --> 34:21.120]  are worse fears that this world health organization campaign is not about
[34:21.120 --> 34:24.720]  eradicating neonatal tetanus but a well coordinated
[34:24.720 --> 34:29.120]  forceful population control mass sterilization exercise
[34:29.120 --> 34:32.720]  using a proven fertility regulating vaccine
[34:32.720 --> 34:35.440]  now that sounds a lot like a conspiracy theory
[34:35.440 --> 34:39.280]  until you read the world health organization's own literature
[34:39.280 --> 34:45.520]  this is a report from august 1992 titled fertility regulating vaccines
[34:45.520 --> 34:49.440]  in it they discussed the most advanced research on frv's
[34:49.440 --> 34:53.440]  involves vaccines directed against hcg
[34:53.440 --> 34:57.440]  as the kenyan doctors point out world health organization conducted
[34:57.440 --> 35:03.120]  massive vaccination campaigns using the tetanus vaccine that was laced with hcg
[35:03.120 --> 35:08.320]  in mexico in 1993 and nicaragua and the philippines in 94
[35:08.320 --> 35:11.920]  just like with this current inoculation program in kenya
[35:11.920 --> 35:15.360]  these campaigns targeted women of childbearing age
[35:15.360 --> 35:21.200]  14 to 49 years old and each received a total of five injections a typical
[35:21.200 --> 35:24.480]  tetanus vaccine scheduled is just three shots
[35:24.480 --> 35:28.640]  and don't be fooled this isn't about giving women around the world a choice
[35:28.640 --> 35:33.520]  the tetanus lace with hcg was given as a fertility regulating vaccine
[35:33.520 --> 35:37.520]  without disclosing its contraceptive effect to the young girls
[35:37.520 --> 35:42.320]  and mothers why would the un want to suppress the population in developing
[35:42.320 --> 35:46.080]  countries the overlords of scientific dictatorship
[35:46.080 --> 35:51.760]  are ruthlessly prosecuting a war on our most defenseless
[35:51.760 --> 35:57.120]  in december of 1974 the u.s government made third world population reduction
[35:57.120 --> 36:02.560]  a central national security issue the operation plan titled national
[36:02.560 --> 36:06.960]  security study memorandum 200 openly stated that populist third world
[36:06.960 --> 36:10.080]  nations posed a threat to the international
[36:10.080 --> 36:16.400]  elites monopoly of global power the kissinger authored u.s plan targeted 13
[36:16.400 --> 36:21.120]  key countries where massive population reduction was called for
[36:21.120 --> 36:25.760]  kissinger recommended that imf and world bank loans be given on condition that
[36:25.760 --> 36:29.440]  nations initiate aggressive population control programs
[36:29.440 --> 36:34.400]  such as sterilization kissinger also recommended that food be used as a
[36:34.400 --> 36:37.360]  weapon and that instigating wars was also a
[36:37.360 --> 36:43.520]  helpful tool in reducing population in 1972 the nixon
[36:43.520 --> 36:47.520]  white house also implemented a eugenics policy which was directed by
[36:47.520 --> 36:52.400]  george herbert walker bush then united states ambassador to the united nations
[36:52.400 --> 36:56.320]  bush advised china on the formulation of their one child policy
[36:56.320 --> 37:00.880]  and directed the federal government to forcibly sterilize more than 40 percent
[37:00.880 --> 37:06.000]  of native american women on reservations and following in his eugenics's
[37:06.000 --> 37:09.920]  father's footsteps bill gates donates millions of dollars to
[37:09.920 --> 37:13.920]  research population control programs
[37:13.920 --> 37:18.000]  probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero
[37:18.000 --> 37:22.720]  that's back from high school algebra but let's let's take a look
[37:22.720 --> 37:27.600]  first we've got population the world today has 6.8 billion people
[37:27.600 --> 37:32.000]  that's headed up to about nine billion now if we do a really great job
[37:32.000 --> 37:36.720]  on new vaccines health care reproductive health services we could
[37:36.720 --> 37:40.720]  lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent the bill and melinda gates
[37:40.720 --> 37:44.960]  foundation is committing 10 billion dollars over the next 10 years to make
[37:44.960 --> 37:49.040]  it the most aggressive decade ever rolling out new vaccines to poor
[37:49.040 --> 37:52.960]  nations around the world this idea of population control has
[37:52.960 --> 37:55.760]  been around for decades and probably much longer
[37:55.760 --> 38:00.160]  it's backed by powerful economic interests to call the world population
[38:00.160 --> 38:05.200]  of the useless feeders so corporate giants can exploit world resources
[38:05.200 --> 38:08.000]  unimpeded
[38:08.800 --> 38:13.360]  well fabulous job by leon macadoo and all the great graphics in there by darin
[38:13.360 --> 38:18.480]  mcbreen and everybody else just in this operation working as a team
[38:18.480 --> 38:25.440]  info wars dot com is a true treasure i'm very proud of the team we've got and
[38:25.440 --> 38:30.720]  this good ship and it's the good ship that you out there built
[38:30.720 --> 38:33.760]  when you've supported us by word of mouth when you've
[38:33.760 --> 38:37.120]  supported the products that we promote and sell
[38:37.120 --> 38:41.040]  which of course you found out are high quality and very affordable
[38:41.040 --> 38:46.160]  competitive and it's just a great responsibility and i pray every day
[38:46.160 --> 38:53.600]  that god lead god direct my hand and my mind and to help me be a good person
[38:53.600 --> 38:56.560]  and to help me make the right decisions and really tell you the truth the whole
[38:56.560 --> 39:02.720]  truth and nothing but the truth but i think i have been put in this position
[39:03.600 --> 39:11.040]  for the reason that i am wild and i do have a twist of cane in me
[39:11.040 --> 39:18.800]  like everyone does and so the fact is is that i'm not
[39:18.800 --> 39:25.040]  some shrinking violet unworldly person
[39:25.040 --> 39:28.880]  but at the same time then i and my spirit am guilty
[39:28.880 --> 39:31.920]  for the fact that
[39:32.240 --> 39:36.080]  comparatively people would say i'm a very moral person
[39:36.080 --> 39:41.520]  a very nice person a very truthful person but at the same time
[39:41.520 --> 39:46.160]  i could feel the spirit of this world in me
[39:46.160 --> 39:51.040]  and it is
[39:52.640 --> 39:58.400]  very dangerous and so many people out there aren't even aware of it
[39:58.400 --> 40:03.040]  so they just give into it and become slaves of it
[40:03.040 --> 40:06.800]  and just think it's cute to be in control and do all these horrible things
[40:06.800 --> 40:10.960]  to other people and you can argue there are areas of india calcutta and other
[40:10.960 --> 40:14.800]  areas and areas of africa and areas of south america and
[40:14.800 --> 40:18.160]  central america that are living hellholes with homeless kids running
[40:18.160 --> 40:20.160]  around with snot running out of their noses
[40:20.160 --> 40:23.280]  you know huffing chemicals all day because that's all they have
[40:23.280 --> 40:28.880]  out of the junkyards and just euthanizing themselves
[40:28.880 --> 40:35.760]  by frying their brains but it all goes back to nutrition
[40:35.760 --> 40:38.800]  and if we just built them up and gave them the technology
[40:38.800 --> 40:42.480]  and the true industrialization all the metrics show
[40:42.480 --> 40:46.240]  anywhere in the world people become educated informed
[40:46.240 --> 40:49.600]  upright smart
[40:49.760 --> 40:54.080]  and only have two kids or less and population starts to drop
[40:54.080 --> 40:58.320]  instead the globalists have put in systems to block industrialization
[40:58.320 --> 41:03.120]  to control populations and allow to huge population bloom
[41:03.120 --> 41:07.840]  they then call for world government to come in and set up a draconian system
[41:07.840 --> 41:10.880]  worldwide to then exterminate masses of these people
[41:10.880 --> 41:17.520]  and really all it is is an earth killing conspiracy
[41:17.520 --> 41:21.680]  and a huge third world population has been bred as a sacrifice
[41:21.680 --> 41:25.680]  to the god of this world and from all my research
[41:25.680 --> 41:30.960]  intellectual research factual research that's really what we're looking at
[41:30.960 --> 41:34.560]  is these globalists just want to build a hellish world they want autonomous
[41:34.560 --> 41:39.920]  killer robots land sea and air they want to merge with machines they
[41:39.920 --> 41:47.360]  want to just destroy entire populations they enjoy it
[41:47.360 --> 41:50.880]  it's what they do Ted Bundy why do you like to kidnap women and torture them
[41:50.880 --> 41:54.080]  and kill them because i like it
[42:00.800 --> 42:07.120]  and the public is so simple minded on average
[42:07.120 --> 42:10.480]  and i don't think has any idea the grip
[42:10.480 --> 42:17.440]  that we're in right now the probing the scientific manipulation
[42:17.440 --> 42:21.520]  coming up for two hours in studio or close to two hours
[42:21.520 --> 42:26.080]  the real rick ross for ricky ross is going to be in studio
[42:28.480 --> 42:32.480]  and he spent 25 years of a life sentence behind bars
[42:32.480 --> 42:36.160]  for being one of the biggest cocaine dealers in u.s history
[42:36.160 --> 42:40.880]  if not the biggest publicly known dealer
[42:40.960 --> 42:43.760]  people say well how would you have somebody like that into your studio
[42:43.760 --> 42:48.320]  well he had the nerve to not shut up when it came out it was the CIA
[42:48.320 --> 42:52.240]  and to tell the truth and to get a longer prison sentence
[42:52.240 --> 42:55.920]  and he has repented of what he's done and speaks at high schools and colleges
[42:55.920 --> 42:59.440]  everywhere and explains to people why they shouldn't get on drugs
[42:59.440 --> 43:03.520]  and why the drug war is a fraud as well and
[43:03.520 --> 43:07.840]  how do we sit there and say oh he's bad but the government
[43:07.840 --> 43:13.200]  that shipped it in and the prosecutors that saw the evidence it was the CIA
[43:13.200 --> 43:17.600]  and threatened him and others to shut up they're good though
[43:17.600 --> 43:20.800]  they're good because they shipped the drugs in they're good because they
[43:20.800 --> 43:24.080]  covered it up they're good and then they put
[43:24.080 --> 43:29.520]  rick ross in jail for 25 years when he wasn't a gun toting violent drug dealer
[43:29.520 --> 43:33.760]  that's the low-level people he was the major distributor
[43:33.760 --> 43:38.480]  under the CIA through one intermediary
[43:38.480 --> 43:41.920]  as they flew it into those air force bases every day
[43:41.920 --> 43:47.200]  by the plane load rick ross was just the black front
[43:47.200 --> 43:51.120]  because everybody knows a drug dealer is a black man
[43:51.120 --> 43:55.440]  no ladies and gentlemen going back to prohibition when alcohol prohibition
[43:55.440 --> 43:58.000]  ended they always stuck to red-black districts
[43:58.000 --> 44:01.840]  and the liquor districts in the black neighborhoods
[44:01.840 --> 44:04.560]  because you didn't want to do that in your neighborhood because you're the
[44:04.560 --> 44:08.720]  preacher your wife might see you so that's where the crime getting nestled
[44:08.720 --> 44:15.040]  started in the black areas and then prohibition ended
[44:15.520 --> 44:19.360]  in the 1930s and they made narcotics illegal and started shipping them into
[44:19.360 --> 44:22.560]  the black communities then they didn't start shipping drugs in
[44:22.560 --> 44:27.360]  to south central in 1982 with the crack cocaine epidemic
[44:27.360 --> 44:32.160]  a CIA invention crack cocaine perfected free basing
[44:32.160 --> 44:35.680]  the mcdonalds of free basing
[44:35.920 --> 44:40.880]  they didn't no no no it was going on forever
[44:40.960 --> 44:45.280]  it was always going on and they didn't just stick it in the poor black
[44:45.280 --> 44:48.320]  neighborhoods they stuck it in the poor white neighborhoods as well
[44:48.320 --> 44:51.520]  they'd stick it in the poor irish neighborhoods and say the dirty irish
[44:51.520 --> 44:55.520]  they got gambling and hookers and and and and everything else
[44:55.520 --> 44:59.520]  and drinking those irish scum while meanwhile it was all
[44:59.520 --> 45:02.960]  being stuck in their neighborhood it's the same story
[45:02.960 --> 45:07.680]  over and over and over again and it's even about what color you are a
[45:07.680 --> 45:10.640]  religion in every country they'll have some subgroup
[45:10.640 --> 45:14.400]  that they park all the crime in and then they blame that group you go back to
[45:14.400 --> 45:19.280]  Rome 2000 years ago they would stick the vice and the corruption
[45:19.280 --> 45:22.720]  in the neighborhoods of the minority groups the greeks
[45:22.720 --> 45:26.880]  or the galls or the north africans they all had their own neighborhoods
[45:26.880 --> 45:33.120]  and they would stick it in that neighborhood that's what you do
[45:33.120 --> 45:36.320]  and so we're going to explore the social engineering because it's done on so
[45:36.320 --> 45:38.320]  many levels and if you ever start thinking about
[45:38.320 --> 45:42.720]  what is the social engineering and you ever start
[45:42.720 --> 45:46.480]  wanting to understand it it's not work to learn they make textbooks and school
[45:46.480 --> 45:48.560]  boring they don't put really interesting stuff in there
[45:48.560 --> 45:52.320]  because you might get addicted to knowledge and then it just opens up and
[45:52.320 --> 45:56.000]  you learn how the world works and even if you're a sociopath or a
[45:56.000 --> 46:00.640]  psychopath this knowledge of how the world works
[46:00.640 --> 46:04.720]  can make you incredibly successful go into college give me a break
[46:04.720 --> 46:07.920]  that's just to meet people and maybe get a job at a company because you date the
[46:07.920 --> 46:11.120]  right person or you're in the right fraternity
[46:11.120 --> 46:14.080]  nine times out of ten college is worthless unless it's engineering
[46:14.080 --> 46:18.560]  or law or something all the liberal arts there there is no jobs for that in the
[46:18.560 --> 46:23.200]  future i'm not attacking you it's a scam we told to 20 years ago it was a scam
[46:23.200 --> 46:28.800]  now it's an admitted scam they charge you more than you'll ever make
[46:28.800 --> 46:32.800]  and it's a way for you just to keep being a kid till you're 25 30 and not go out
[46:32.800 --> 46:38.080]  and actually see what's going on in the world social engineering
[46:38.080 --> 46:45.440]  india mass sterilization women were forced into camps
[46:45.440 --> 46:48.480]  say relatives
[46:48.960 --> 46:52.320]  brother-in-law one of the victims says women were hurt like cattle
[46:52.320 --> 46:56.400]  after 12 die and scores injured following botched operations
[46:56.400 --> 46:58.960]  yeah they're actually cutting their uteruses out you know it came out a
[46:58.960 --> 47:02.000]  few years ago that in california other states they were still sterilizing
[47:02.000 --> 47:04.880]  women secretly
[47:04.880 --> 47:09.360]  there's a free government run camp but it comes around you
[47:09.360 --> 47:16.080]  this is a whitewash in the guardian here's another one 24 reasons
[47:18.480 --> 47:22.320]  look at this india mass sterilization women were forced into camps say
[47:22.320 --> 47:27.120]  relatives depopulation vaccine in kenya and beyond kenya's
[47:27.120 --> 47:30.480]  catholic bishops are charging two united nations organizations with
[47:30.480 --> 47:34.320]  sterilizing millions of girls we all the documents where they do it and women
[47:34.320 --> 47:36.880]  kenya's catholic bishops are charging two united nations organizations
[47:36.880 --> 47:39.920]  with sterilizing millions of girls and women undercover of anti-tetanus
[47:39.920 --> 47:43.600]  inoculation program sponsored by the kenyan government
[47:43.600 --> 47:47.120]  it was given to 2.3 million girls and now
[47:47.120 --> 47:50.640]  they're sterilized well yeah the un got caught adding a hormone to it to
[47:50.640 --> 47:54.240]  create an autoimmune response that hormone thus causing spontaneous
[47:54.240 --> 47:57.360]  miscarriages at the start of the second trimester the article goes through the
[47:57.360 --> 48:02.480]  documents newscast the un basically admitting it
[48:02.480 --> 48:05.360]  so just thought you might want to go read those stories
[48:05.360 --> 48:09.600]  they're up on info wars dot com you just heard
[48:09.600 --> 48:14.240]  lian's report on that is the un using vaccines to secretly sterilize women all
[48:14.240 --> 48:18.960]  the world i don't know to bears go to the bathroom in the woods
[48:20.160 --> 48:25.040]  michael schneider's got an article on that breaking it down
[48:25.040 --> 48:29.600]  and let's move on to why they want to stupid people are going
[48:29.600 --> 48:33.280]  to be in for a shock penalty for uninsured not signing up
[48:33.280 --> 48:37.840]  for obama care to more than triple now that the midterm elections are over
[48:37.840 --> 48:41.360]  cbs news from insurance quotes dot com
[48:41.360 --> 48:47.280]  senior analyst you think it doubling was bad how about quadruple
[48:47.280 --> 48:54.640]  uh-huh you thought a 500 increase was too much well
[48:54.640 --> 49:02.160]  second video emerges of obama care architect calling american stupid
[49:02.160 --> 49:08.560]  gruber paid 400 000 by administration visited white house a dozen times
[49:08.560 --> 49:12.240]  despite telling msnbc that his comments were off the cuff a second video is
[49:12.240 --> 49:16.000]  emerge of obama care architect jonathan gruber saying the laws were passed
[49:16.000 --> 49:18.320]  because americans were too stupid to understand it
[49:18.320 --> 49:21.760]  yeah he said we kept it un transparent and that and being stupid we got it
[49:21.760 --> 49:24.640]  through and that's why i like a transparency is key
[49:24.640 --> 49:29.200]  during an appearance on the ronan ferro daily grubber
[49:29.200 --> 49:32.560]  tried to explain away the initial comments by claiming he was speaking off
[49:32.560 --> 49:35.440]  the cuff when he said that a lack of transparency was crucial
[49:35.440 --> 49:38.560]  in fooling stupid americans during the effort to pass obama care
[49:38.560 --> 49:42.160]  that's right and you'll just sit there and lecture everyone gruber
[49:42.160 --> 49:45.520]  that it isn't increasing right even though it is your bill comes in it's
[49:45.520 --> 49:48.960]  bigger but it isn't bigger because you said so you control reality let's go
[49:48.960 --> 49:52.400]  to his first quote that they tried to censor and then we have the new one to
[49:52.400 --> 49:55.440]  his students it's just you can't do it politically you just
[49:55.440 --> 49:58.480]  literally cannot do it okay transparent financing
[49:58.480 --> 50:01.040]  unless i have transparent financing all the transparent spending
[50:01.040 --> 50:05.840]  i mean the this bill was written in a tortured way to make sure cbo did not
[50:05.840 --> 50:09.280]  score the mandate as taxes his cbo scored the mandate as taxes the bill
[50:09.280 --> 50:14.400]  dies okay so it was written to do that in terms of in terms of risk-rated
[50:14.400 --> 50:17.760]  subsidies if you get a law which said healthy people are going to pay in
[50:17.760 --> 50:20.480]  he made explicit the hell who will pay and sick people get money it would not
[50:20.480 --> 50:23.600]  have passed okay just like the count people
[50:23.600 --> 50:27.520]  transparent lack of transparency is a huge political advantage
[50:27.520 --> 50:31.200]  and basically you know all the stupidity american voter or whatever
[50:31.200 --> 50:35.440]  but basically that was really really critical to get in the thing to pass and
[50:35.440 --> 50:39.520]  you know it's a second best argument look i wish mark was right
[50:39.520 --> 50:44.000]  now let's go to his newest clip to his students and then we also have him on
[50:44.000 --> 50:50.160]  msnbc but here is gruber
[50:50.160 --> 50:53.920]  yet again saying the same thing
[51:04.080 --> 51:08.800]  and see they're teaching the college students all over america
[51:08.800 --> 51:12.400]  that you lie you deceive you're a ruling class that
[51:12.400 --> 51:15.760]  feeds on them when they're all they're paying
[51:15.760 --> 51:19.200]  nine times out of ten for a three hundred thousand dollar degree
[51:19.200 --> 51:24.080]  with interest it'll be six hundred thousand that you'll not get a job with
[51:24.080 --> 51:30.400]  and that you've been chumped but then they walk out like i'm so smart i don't
[51:30.400 --> 51:33.760]  know anyone out there more arrogant than professors i know
[51:33.760 --> 51:37.040]  then there's some good professors i don't want to over generalize but let's
[51:37.040 --> 51:43.440]  say 70 percent are on unbelievable power trips and are so arrogant
[51:43.440 --> 51:48.080]  it'll just blow your mind
[51:48.080 --> 51:52.800]  because they're egomaniac narcissists that just have people groveling all day
[51:52.800 --> 51:55.600]  to go in and hear them walk around and talk about
[51:55.600 --> 51:59.200]  yeah we keep things secret and twist it when we rip them off and massively
[51:59.200 --> 52:03.600]  increase their prices is so stupid
[52:03.600 --> 52:10.400]  because that's all they've got they relish this
[52:10.400 --> 52:14.880]  and then i've got bill gates saying yeah we've got death panels but we don't want
[52:14.880 --> 52:18.320]  to call it that and yeah we want to reduce the population down to zero
[52:18.320 --> 52:21.760]  here's the equation and then the the ted tv crowd laughs
[52:21.760 --> 52:26.560]  because they're in on the club you get behind closed doors almost any
[52:26.560 --> 52:30.720]  medical doctor or any scientist or any professor i mean most of them and you
[52:30.720 --> 52:34.080]  say you know there are too many people we need to go ahead and force we reduce
[52:34.080 --> 52:38.480]  they're like yeah you're right yeah let's not
[52:38.480 --> 52:41.120]  think of ways to fix it let's not think of ways to make it better
[52:41.120 --> 52:44.960]  no no i did you read the royal commission on population 1949
[52:44.960 --> 52:48.960]  commissioned by his royal highness elizabeth the second's father
[52:48.960 --> 52:54.320]  did you read the 200 page report i did i saw it in a footnote in a lorouche
[52:54.320 --> 52:58.720]  publication and then i went to the ut library and actually dug it out
[52:58.720 --> 53:01.920]  that was back before the internet was big and powerful like in 1996
[53:01.920 --> 53:04.880]  and i read the whole report i covered it on television
[53:04.880 --> 53:09.200]  but i dig that tape up it's documents in one of these storage facilities
[53:09.200 --> 53:15.920]  i got a copy of it off the micro fish and they said right there we could fix
[53:15.920 --> 53:19.680]  what we call overpopulation let's just say it's real for the matter of
[53:19.680 --> 53:24.880]  a debate but that would then give decentralization power of industrialization
[53:24.880 --> 53:27.280]  and technological development that we can't control
[53:27.280 --> 53:30.880]  we're already be on spacespaces by now if we give it to all these countries so we
[53:30.880 --> 53:34.560]  need to just go in with the un taxation imf world bank
[53:34.560 --> 53:37.760]  development type funds and call it that global marshal plans
[53:37.760 --> 53:42.640]  to control everything and go ahead and let the population bloom keep it third
[53:42.640 --> 53:47.440]  world and then mitigate it later once that crisis has grown and once you
[53:47.440 --> 53:52.560]  understand the the the the the dark math the logic of these satanist it
[53:52.560 --> 53:57.600]  makes perfect sense again they always create the crisis they're
[53:57.600 --> 54:02.080]  worried about that they're trying to get you to then ideologically
[54:02.080 --> 54:05.120]  travel in the peace court when you're in college
[54:05.120 --> 54:10.000]  to india and see dead bodies on the streets and fleas everywhere
[54:10.000 --> 54:16.240]  and rats everywhere and huge piles of feces just just just just in just
[54:16.240 --> 54:20.560]  everywhere and huge throngs of people and women being raped all over the place
[54:20.560 --> 54:27.040]  and i mean india is a living hell
[54:27.040 --> 54:31.520]  a living hell in the major cities it's beautiful in many areas
[54:31.520 --> 54:35.360]  has a lot of interesting culture but they've got a billion 100 million people
[54:35.360 --> 54:37.920]  let's see about memories right i think it's a billion 100 million now
[54:37.920 --> 54:43.600]  china's 1.3 bill let's look up the current population of india
[54:43.600 --> 54:48.160]  it's like half the size of china and it is a crisis
[54:48.160 --> 54:53.920]  oh it's bigger than i thought it's 1.252 billion so it's it's it's a billion
[54:53.920 --> 54:59.120]  and almost the population of the u.s added on
[54:59.120 --> 55:01.840]  so you say well the u.n then it's doing what they have to
[55:01.840 --> 55:07.200]  but once you set the precedent to have the u.n and all these health agencies in
[55:07.200 --> 55:11.280]  on secret projects that even go public in the 90s they admitted yeah we're
[55:11.280 --> 55:15.680]  sterilizing women with a tetanus shot they're doing it to everybody
[55:15.680 --> 55:20.560]  see i have empathy for these indians not just because i know at an
[55:20.560 --> 55:24.000]  intellectual level it's going to come back on me
[55:24.000 --> 55:27.280]  that that what can be done to them is going to happen to me my default already
[55:27.280 --> 55:31.360]  knows that so i have empathy for them
[55:31.360 --> 55:34.320]  does it mean that i want to bring in a 50 million of them
[55:34.320 --> 55:37.360]  as a strategic group to work for half of what i'll work for
[55:37.360 --> 55:42.960]  to make me a debt slave to no no no no i love them as humans but they are a
[55:42.960 --> 55:47.440]  weapon being fired at our country
[55:47.440 --> 55:50.080]  see the difference
[55:51.040 --> 55:54.400]  just like i don't want to sterilize the mexican women with a garter cell shot
[55:54.400 --> 55:59.280]  that is sterilizing many of them reducing fertility it's a soft kill
[55:59.280 --> 56:03.520]  on record look it up hpv mandated by law
[56:03.520 --> 56:07.760]  in mexico you can you'll never hear mecha or la raza
[56:07.760 --> 56:12.320]  the hispanic cookless clan groups uh saying don't sterilize our girls
[56:12.320 --> 56:15.840]  because they're there what do you think fortune 500 funds them
[56:15.840 --> 56:18.960]  to make it a racial group that never learns english the world language
[56:18.960 --> 56:23.040]  they can be kept in barrios under their lfa control
[56:23.040 --> 56:26.080]  to make the u.s just like a failed state like mexico
[56:26.080 --> 56:31.120]  i'd like to see mexico filthy rich with huge glistening buildings and is just a
[56:31.120 --> 56:34.800]  jewel of a country i'd love to see their people wealthy
[56:34.800 --> 56:39.120]  i want to be like that i want everybody to succeed
[56:39.120 --> 56:43.280]  yeah there's the headline south china morning post
[56:43.280 --> 56:46.400]  hundreds of girls in columbian town sick of taking garter cell vaccine
[56:46.400 --> 56:50.080]  yeah it didn't hundreds folks that's a sigh up they always give you the low
[56:50.080 --> 56:55.040]  number it's okay you take the shot and then
[56:55.040 --> 56:58.640]  you have such a bad auto immune response inside your body that blood pours
[56:58.640 --> 57:01.120]  out of you but you're not gonna have to worry
[57:01.120 --> 57:06.000]  about baby sweetheart but you're not gonna hear the race
[57:06.000 --> 57:09.760]  talking about that because they were founded by the ford foundation
[57:09.760 --> 57:13.440]  to destroy hispanic's future
[57:14.080 --> 57:17.520]  just like the republican party the democratic party all these groups at the
[57:17.520 --> 57:22.000]  top are social engineers there to sell everyone out period
[57:22.000 --> 57:25.200]  and the minute you start realizing that that we're all in this together is the
[57:25.200 --> 57:28.960]  minute we can turn this planet around industrialize these countries reduce
[57:28.960 --> 57:32.000]  population or create clean technologies but they
[57:32.000 --> 57:35.360]  they bring in all these fake clean technologies that are just boondoggles
[57:35.360 --> 57:40.720]  meant to make sure the rest of the planet doesn't get the real technology
[57:41.920 --> 57:47.760]  so frustrating i'm so angry about it we're gonna go to break come back

[1:08:46.320 --> 1:08:51.520]  chance to talk to freeway ricky ross
[1:08:51.520 --> 1:08:57.040]  and of course uh rick ross is i've been recognized as a major pawn of the cia
[1:08:57.040 --> 1:09:00.160]  drug wargame he was a pioneer in the crack cocaine
[1:09:00.160 --> 1:09:04.640]  trade in los angeles ross harvested millions of dollars a day
[1:09:04.640 --> 1:09:08.400]  as an unknown participant of the cia and u.s drug enforcement agency
[1:09:08.400 --> 1:09:12.480]  ops and then long after he got out of it they still set him up and send him
[1:09:12.480 --> 1:09:16.960]  to prison and here's my issue
[1:09:18.240 --> 1:09:22.080]  it's the government that made narcotics illegal when prohibition ended of
[1:09:22.080 --> 1:09:24.080]  alcohol because they needed another business
[1:09:24.080 --> 1:09:27.680]  to skim off of that's on record they've been shipping the narcotics into this
[1:09:27.680 --> 1:09:31.520]  country since they made them illegal you could buy cocaine heroin
[1:09:31.520 --> 1:09:36.240]  speed anything under different names at the drug store
[1:09:36.240 --> 1:09:39.520]  you would go and get coke syrup cocaine syrup
[1:09:39.520 --> 1:09:43.920]  shot into your quote tonic that's where soft drinks came from
[1:09:43.920 --> 1:09:47.360]  um i know i had family that you know basically
[1:09:47.360 --> 1:09:51.440]  worked in that business up in uh waco where dr pepper comes from
[1:09:51.440 --> 1:09:56.320]  it had cocaine in it too in fact one of my ancestors actually named dr pepper
[1:09:56.320 --> 1:10:02.720]  the point is dr will pep you up so this guy's had been a dr pepper as well
[1:10:02.720 --> 1:10:06.800]  you make it illegal though it brings all the prostitution
[1:10:06.800 --> 1:10:10.880]  it brings all the money laundering it brings all the exploitation
[1:10:10.880 --> 1:10:14.640]  into it and makes it dirty and how are you going to legalize
[1:10:14.640 --> 1:10:18.000]  slavery again in this country how are you going to scoop up three four five
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:20.720]  million people and throw them in jail every year
[1:10:20.720 --> 1:10:24.560]  and take their rights away you do it by putting something highly addictive
[1:10:24.560 --> 1:10:28.240]  beer is addictive we can lock them up for that fast food's addictive gonna lock
[1:10:28.240 --> 1:10:32.720]  you up for that they throw it out hope people
[1:10:32.720 --> 1:10:37.680]  pick up the adulterated poison filled with all sorts of toxic garbage
[1:10:37.680 --> 1:10:41.040]  and then when they catch you on it or catch you selling it to support your
[1:10:41.040 --> 1:10:44.480]  habit you're going to be thrown under the jail
[1:10:44.480 --> 1:10:48.720]  and then the prisons are broken up into racial gangs the black gangs the white
[1:10:48.720 --> 1:10:51.360]  gangs the spanish gangs the asian gangs just like
[1:10:51.360 --> 1:10:55.680]  they're breaking up the rest of our society this is a social engineering
[1:10:55.680 --> 1:11:00.400]  program on record and rick ross could have shot
[1:11:00.400 --> 1:11:03.840]  about the cia he could have gone along they wouldn't have given him a life
[1:11:03.840 --> 1:11:08.080]  sentence i remember interviewing gary webb got the big
[1:11:08.080 --> 1:11:12.480]  renter film out right now of course kill the messenger
[1:11:12.480 --> 1:11:16.960]  dealing with it and i remember talking to web he was going to come on in a few
[1:11:16.960 --> 1:11:21.440]  months and he gave me a disc with all his documents
[1:11:21.440 --> 1:11:25.120]  and he was going to have a new book coming out to vindicate everything he
[1:11:25.120 --> 1:11:28.400]  done everything he said he won all sorts of prizes
[1:11:28.400 --> 1:11:33.040]  you name it but his editors and the la times run by the cia
[1:11:33.040 --> 1:11:37.360]  that was declassified two months ago the cia did target him with a disinformation
[1:11:37.360 --> 1:11:40.160]  campaign they did lie and say he was discredited
[1:11:40.160 --> 1:11:43.200]  he would never admit he was discredited because it wasn't true and before he
[1:11:43.200 --> 1:11:45.600]  could vindicate himself they killed him now
[1:11:45.600 --> 1:11:49.680]  why would the cia declassify that a month before the film came out
[1:11:49.680 --> 1:11:57.680]  two months ago why would they do something like that
[1:11:57.680 --> 1:12:01.520]  well i'm gonna ask rick ross that question but
[1:12:01.520 --> 1:12:05.680]  i really think it's because it's already so well known it's even on fox news
[1:12:05.680 --> 1:12:09.920]  that our troops grow the opium and load it on c 130's and then it comes here and
[1:12:09.920 --> 1:12:13.840]  then it goes through people like ross that are intermediaries
[1:12:13.840 --> 1:12:18.240]  it goes cia to the black front because it's the black man bringing us the
[1:12:18.240 --> 1:12:22.560]  drugs he's the bad guy not the cia not the
[1:12:22.560 --> 1:12:26.960]  establishment it's the tony montana type it's it's
[1:12:26.960 --> 1:12:30.880]  the cuban he's behind it it's the black guy or it's the you know it's the white
[1:12:30.880 --> 1:12:35.920]  trash guy in the trailer selling the drugs no it's not
[1:12:35.920 --> 1:12:39.360]  and then as the economy shuts down more people want the drugs your daughter
[1:12:39.360 --> 1:12:42.560]  gets hooked on him now she's a topless cancer then she's a
[1:12:42.560 --> 1:12:45.920]  hooker this is how you bring down society and
[1:12:45.920 --> 1:12:49.360]  then you got swat teams running around paramilitary for the war on drugs get
[1:12:49.360 --> 1:12:52.880]  the patriot actor using for the war on drugs merging and all together so
[1:12:52.880 --> 1:12:58.480]  everyone's under suspicion your daughter hurts her back in a volleyball
[1:12:58.480 --> 1:13:01.040]  accident when i said one of my friends when she's 16
[1:13:01.040 --> 1:13:04.960]  two years later is addicted to pain pills goes around doctor shopping to get
[1:13:04.960 --> 1:13:07.920]  the things instead of getting treatment they throw her in jail
[1:13:07.920 --> 1:13:12.080]  then she gets in with bad people next she comes out with an education and
[1:13:12.080 --> 1:13:16.000]  criminal activity after the year and becomes you guessed it
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:21.520]  a streetwalker this is how you kill a civilization this is how you
[1:13:21.520 --> 1:13:25.840]  annihilate a culture this is how you bring a country down
[1:13:25.840 --> 1:13:29.920]  so a minority of people in the youtube comments and on info wars.com
[1:13:29.920 --> 1:13:34.480]  and prisonplanet.com said what do you do in having a
[1:13:34.480 --> 1:13:40.480]  huge cocaine dealer on your show okay what are you doing putting up with a
[1:13:40.480 --> 1:13:44.960]  government that went into hiring see there's no outrage about that
[1:13:44.960 --> 1:13:48.960]  there's no outrage about the big banks laundering 386 billion dollars in two
[1:13:48.960 --> 1:13:51.680]  years bloomberg reported two banks alone
[1:13:51.680 --> 1:13:56.320]  wells fargo wakovia 380 plus billion type it in
[1:13:56.320 --> 1:14:01.200]  big banks laundered 300 plus billion it'll pop up bloomberg apu name it from
[1:14:01.200 --> 1:14:04.160]  four years ago that's just one admission they paid 111 million
[1:14:04.160 --> 1:14:06.640]  dollar fine that's like if you rob a bank for a
[1:14:06.640 --> 1:14:08.800]  million bucks paying a three thousand dollar fine
[1:14:08.800 --> 1:14:12.640]  it's a slap on the wrist it's not a slap on the wrist it's like them flicking a
[1:14:12.640 --> 1:14:16.480]  penny after they robbed the bank the cops you walk out the cops open the truck
[1:14:16.480 --> 1:14:19.920]  up help you load the stolen money and you throw them a quarter
[1:14:19.920 --> 1:14:24.240]  that's what this is that's how this system works and now it's expanding the
[1:14:24.240 --> 1:14:26.960]  racket with with with with with all the psych
[1:14:26.960 --> 1:14:30.160]  testing in the schools and the drugging of the kids that way
[1:14:30.160 --> 1:14:33.280]  to get them into the system

[1:14:47.920 --> 1:14:50.560]  for him he was sentenced to life imprisonment after being convicted
[1:14:50.560 --> 1:14:53.680]  of trying to purchase more than 100 kilograms of cocaine from a federal
[1:14:53.680 --> 1:14:56.160]  agent ross became the subject of controversy later
[1:14:56.160 --> 1:14:59.600]  that year when a series of articles by journalist gary webb and the san jose
[1:14:59.600 --> 1:15:04.320]  mercury brought to light the connection between one of ross's cocaine sources
[1:15:04.320 --> 1:15:07.440]  and the cia as part of the iran conference scandal
[1:15:07.440 --> 1:15:11.600]  his sentencing was later reduced to less than 20 years
[1:15:11.600 --> 1:15:14.960]  and released in september 2009 he's finally off
[1:15:14.960 --> 1:15:18.800]  the uh probation the harassment all of it able to put his book out that's

[1:15:50.320 --> 1:15:53.360]  webb about it when when this came out about the cia and his trial he didn't
[1:15:53.360 --> 1:15:56.560]  really know about it he was blown away everything suddenly made sense
[1:15:56.560 --> 1:16:00.240]  they said just shut up don't cooperate with this reporter and people and will
[1:16:00.240 --> 1:16:03.040]  go easy he didn't so they gave him life in prison
[1:16:03.040 --> 1:16:07.360]  that was clearly done politically so it was reduced
[1:16:07.360 --> 1:16:10.880]  but it doesn't matter the issue is he's repented of it
[1:16:10.880 --> 1:16:15.120]  the cia and the new world order haven't so he joins us now until the end of the

[1:24:28.320 --> 1:24:32.560]  investigation that later the cia inspector general had to admit
[1:24:32.560 --> 1:24:36.160]  that the cia was involved bringing in the majority of the cocaine at least the
[1:24:36.160 --> 1:24:39.120]  west coast it's much bigger than that me know arkansas
[1:24:39.120 --> 1:24:42.320]  i've interviewed the the pilots that were there unloading the cocaine
[1:24:42.320 --> 1:24:46.960]  not just tosh plumley who's on record i ran contra testimony
[1:24:46.960 --> 1:24:52.560]  but just so many others that were there and saw
[1:24:52.560 --> 1:24:57.360]  saw governors saw vice presidents who would be there personally offloading
[1:24:57.360 --> 1:25:01.120]  aircraft of the cocaine i mean that's what then i mean if local kids saw it
[1:25:01.120 --> 1:25:04.880]  they'd kill them remember me know arkansas on all
[1:25:04.880 --> 1:25:08.960]  that and then if cops talked about that they'd kill the cops
[1:25:08.960 --> 1:25:13.200]  i mean a lot of people died over this information i hope you understand this
[1:25:13.200 --> 1:25:16.480]  and everybody today is like yeah we know they bring it in well wait that we
[1:25:16.480 --> 1:25:20.880]  we didn't know this back in the 90s there been the heroine coming in out of
[1:25:20.880 --> 1:25:23.440]  southeast asia but they'd blame a colonel or somebody
[1:25:23.440 --> 1:25:27.360]  this is organized this is a short segment i want to go back to you
[1:25:27.360 --> 1:25:30.640]  rick ross can it's great to have you here my friend i appreciate your courage
[1:25:30.640 --> 1:25:33.600]  and you're not selling out and getting that longer sentence you know for not
[1:25:33.600 --> 1:25:37.680]  backing down but let's get into now where you left
[1:25:37.680 --> 1:25:41.360]  off you can't get a job uh you know that pays well you don't
[1:25:41.360 --> 1:25:44.560]  have a criminal record you could have got a scholarship you couldn't
[1:25:44.560 --> 1:25:48.160]  read and write for tennis and then your friend comes back from college
[1:25:48.160 --> 1:25:51.200]  yeah so he introduces me to cocaine for the first time
[1:25:51.200 --> 1:25:55.280]  um but but what i also noticed alex you know when i was in prison i did a lot
[1:25:55.280 --> 1:25:58.240]  of thinking back and and i can remember when
[1:25:58.240 --> 1:26:01.040]  before i started selling cocaine you know they started coming out with movies
[1:26:01.040 --> 1:26:05.360]  like superfly and and almost like priming you up for
[1:26:05.360 --> 1:26:08.320]  this lifestyle that that you're about to get into
[1:26:08.320 --> 1:26:11.920]  um so when my friend comes and shows me cocaine i'm interested
[1:26:11.920 --> 1:26:16.080]  because i saw superfly what you hit is key the cia is now declassified that
[1:26:16.080 --> 1:26:21.040]  rock and roll the drug culture the cia delivered the first suit cases of lsd
[1:26:21.040 --> 1:26:24.720]  uh white kids weren't smoking marijuana they delivered it i mean it's
[1:26:24.720 --> 1:26:28.080]  incredible they primed the whole deal oh absolutely it's almost like to get
[1:26:28.080 --> 1:26:31.360]  your mind ready so that when you when you get the
[1:26:31.360 --> 1:26:34.960]  opportunity that you're interested in it's called predictive programming
[1:26:34.960 --> 1:26:37.760]  go ahead i'm sorry it's just what you're saying is absolutely right so when my
[1:26:37.760 --> 1:26:41.040]  friend comes and he shows me this stuff never seen it before
[1:26:41.040 --> 1:26:44.800]  it was yellowish yellowish white and i'm like well i thought cocaine was
[1:26:44.800 --> 1:26:48.080]  supposed to be white he's like no man this is it so he
[1:26:48.080 --> 1:26:51.200]  introduces it to me he gives me a little bit like $50 worth
[1:26:51.200 --> 1:26:54.240]  he said go and see what you can do with it so i go around the neighborhood and
[1:26:54.240 --> 1:26:57.600]  i'm asking everybody nobody knows what it is i mean i'm going all over south
[1:26:57.600 --> 1:27:00.960]  central l.a finally i run into a guy he was a pimp
[1:27:00.960 --> 1:27:05.680]  and he says let me see it and he takes it and he cooks it up and he says
[1:27:05.680 --> 1:27:09.840]  oh yes pretty good stuff and that's how i got started selling cocaine and it
[1:27:09.840 --> 1:27:14.080]  went from there to this one person would buy from me and
[1:27:14.080 --> 1:27:17.520]  then another one come and he would introduce me to somebody else until up
[1:27:17.520 --> 1:27:21.200]  you know some days i'm making three million dollars a day so you got it on
[1:27:21.200 --> 1:27:24.720]  the ground floor of it yeah absolutely totally ground
[1:27:24.720 --> 1:27:28.480]  uh was totally a novice i had never smoked pot
[1:27:28.480 --> 1:27:32.480]  at that time i was still tinkering on being a tennis player you know like
[1:27:32.480 --> 1:27:36.000]  i don't know if you're gonna make it in tennis you know uh but you got to do
[1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:38.400]  something you know my mom's on my back right now because i'm living with my
[1:27:38.400 --> 1:27:42.320]  mom i'm not bringing any income and and she's really going hard on me
[1:27:42.320 --> 1:27:45.280]  you know you're bum you're not going to be doing nothing with your life
[1:27:45.280 --> 1:27:49.760]  uh so i desperately want to do something now i i need to make some money
[1:27:49.760 --> 1:27:52.880]  somewhere so when this opportunity came you know i
[1:27:52.880 --> 1:27:56.480]  thought that it was a blessing from god you know i start off just helping mic
[1:27:56.480 --> 1:28:00.400]  who was my friend you know i'd make the money for him give him all the money
[1:28:00.400 --> 1:28:06.320]  and pretty soon i know the business it goes from there from making 50 bucks a
[1:28:06.320 --> 1:28:11.280]  week to you know like i said three million dollars a day sometimes
[1:28:11.280 --> 1:28:15.440]  in fact i was reading sometimes you were bringing in 30 million dollars a deal
[1:28:15.440 --> 1:28:20.000]  every few days well yeah i mean if you add up 10 days
[1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:22.880]  you know you do 10 days what for what for dylan you know you taught my 10
[1:28:22.880 --> 1:28:27.440]  million dollars or more no like 30 million dollars and this is 1980s
[1:28:27.440 --> 1:28:34.320]  money yeah 18 80s money 84s 85 86
[1:28:34.320 --> 1:28:37.920]  so you were there when folks didn't even know what cocaine was
[1:28:37.920 --> 1:28:41.840]  in my community nobody nobody knew what cocaine yeah it was a rich white guy

[1:38:28.480 --> 1:38:33.200]  when it came out in your trial that the prosecution knew the government knew the
[1:38:33.200 --> 1:38:36.560]  DEA knew the CIA knew that you were one of their main
[1:38:36.560 --> 1:38:40.160]  distributors but you didn't even know i want to get into that relationship and
[1:38:40.160 --> 1:38:42.880]  more but you'd gotten to the point in a few years
[1:38:42.880 --> 1:38:46.160]  to where uh you know tell the story did you ever use
[1:38:46.160 --> 1:38:49.840]  why were you so successful and then go ahead and walk through everything that
[1:38:49.840 --> 1:38:52.960]  happened and then now what your message is to the youth
[1:38:52.960 --> 1:38:56.240]  about what's really going on and we'll talk about gary webb well i did start
[1:38:56.240 --> 1:39:01.040]  using uh for a short time you know i i got up to a point to where uh
[1:39:01.040 --> 1:39:05.120]  i probably had about eight or nine thousand dollars i thought i was rich
[1:39:05.120 --> 1:39:08.560]  so you know when you're rich you start experimenting you know with with with the
[1:39:08.560 --> 1:39:13.600]  drugs um and i looked up all my money was gone
[1:39:13.600 --> 1:39:17.600]  so i immediately quit using you know i went back and regroup regrouped you know
[1:39:17.600 --> 1:39:20.800]  i learned that from tennis when you're doing something wrong uh you go back
[1:39:20.800 --> 1:39:23.280]  and you figure out what you're doing wrong so i figured out that i couldn't
[1:39:23.280 --> 1:39:25.840]  use anymore if i want to be rich i had to stop
[1:39:25.840 --> 1:39:29.520]  using so i stopped using and i went on to get rich
[1:39:29.520 --> 1:39:33.920]  well i made a lot of money you know like i said i made three million dollars a
[1:39:33.920 --> 1:39:36.640]  day sometimes and then it got to the point to where i started seeing the
[1:39:36.640 --> 1:39:40.080]  effects that cocaine was having inside of my community
[1:39:40.080 --> 1:39:44.400]  and it wasn't the effects that i initially thought that it was gonna have
[1:39:44.400 --> 1:39:47.440]  you know i started seeing people pushing baskets i started seeing women
[1:39:47.440 --> 1:39:51.200]  walking the streets and uh women doing anything to get high
[1:39:51.200 --> 1:39:56.240]  and i started to rethink my my position uh that was around
[1:39:56.240 --> 1:40:01.280]  eighty eight eighty nine uh at that time i threw my hands up i say you know
[1:40:01.280 --> 1:40:04.080]  what i'm through with the cocaine business i got enough money i got more
[1:40:04.080 --> 1:40:07.680]  money now than i ever thought that i would have in my life i got businesses
[1:40:07.680 --> 1:40:12.400]  so i walked away well what happened is the government came back
[1:40:12.400 --> 1:40:16.400]  and indicted me for the things that i'd already done went to prison
[1:40:16.400 --> 1:40:21.840]  uh did five years in prison um i got out
[1:40:21.840 --> 1:40:25.840]  immediately after i got out they had the nilobland on started to call me
[1:40:25.840 --> 1:40:29.120]  and his goal was to get me back inside the drugs but i didn't want to go back
[1:40:29.120 --> 1:40:32.640]  i was trying to go straight uh he hounded me for like six months to
[1:40:32.640 --> 1:40:37.040]  introduce him to one of my friends uh once i made the introduction
[1:40:37.040 --> 1:40:43.360]  my friend handing a bag of money and cops swooped in arrested all of us and
[1:40:43.360 --> 1:40:46.560]  they got me for brokering the deal for for making the introduction saying that
[1:40:46.560 --> 1:40:49.120]  i knew that they were going to be doing a drug deal
[1:40:49.120 --> 1:40:53.520]  um and for that reason that i ate it in a bed at the crime
[1:40:53.520 --> 1:40:56.320]  um for that doing that crime it gave me a life sentence
[1:40:56.320 --> 1:41:00.400]  while i was sitting in jail doing uh doing this life sentence fighting my case
[1:41:00.400 --> 1:41:04.560]  uh i was um approached by a reporter gary webb
[1:41:04.560 --> 1:41:08.160]  well gary came down he saw me he started talking about that that i was in
[1:41:08.160 --> 1:41:11.120]  something bigger than you know what i thought i was but you know also two
[1:41:11.120 --> 1:41:13.680]  addicts uh that there were some cops on my case they
[1:41:13.680 --> 1:41:18.240]  called itself the freeway uh task force and those cops were robbing and
[1:41:18.240 --> 1:41:21.120]  stealing and and you know they let the dog bite me while
[1:41:21.120 --> 1:41:25.680]  i was handcuffed uh they got indicted as well
[1:41:25.680 --> 1:41:29.120]  so uh i meet gary webb and he's like oh man this is bigger than
[1:41:29.120 --> 1:41:31.360]  than than what you think it is i'm thinking that they're talking about the
[1:41:31.360 --> 1:41:35.120]  quick cops you know it's like 35 40 cops is running around robbing drug dealers
[1:41:35.120 --> 1:41:38.880]  taking their money and and they became drug dealers themselves
[1:41:38.880 --> 1:41:42.000]  really because they was taking the drugs from one person
[1:41:42.000 --> 1:41:45.440]  planting them on another person and selling them to this person and just
[1:41:45.440 --> 1:41:49.760]  you know just a criminal enterprise i mean the whole the whole war on drugs is
[1:41:49.760 --> 1:41:54.400]  just like one big hopes of one person benefiting this one another one benefiting
[1:41:54.400 --> 1:41:58.720]  that way but at the end of the day uh guys like myself get caught in the
[1:41:58.720 --> 1:42:02.160]  middle and and i believe that we're the ones
[1:42:02.160 --> 1:42:05.760]  who's paying the biggest price not necessarily myself because
[1:42:05.760 --> 1:42:09.760]  uh when i was in prison i couldn't cry about my time
[1:42:09.760 --> 1:42:13.040]  you know if they gave me the life sentence i had to do the rest of my life
[1:42:13.040 --> 1:42:17.680]  in prison uh i could have accepted that because
[1:42:17.680 --> 1:42:21.200]  i knew that what i was doing you know i knew i was selling drugs and i knew
[1:42:21.200 --> 1:42:24.160]  that i shouldn't have been selling drugs after a period of time
[1:42:24.160 --> 1:42:28.160]  you know that's the key to integrity and sanity i've learned is admitting when
[1:42:28.160 --> 1:42:31.280]  you've been wrong admitting and owning up to it
[1:42:31.280 --> 1:42:34.640]  but then there's the giant hypocrisy they're the ones bringing the drugs in
[1:42:34.640 --> 1:42:38.240]  and they're the ones putting you in jail that's a thousand times worse
[1:42:38.240 --> 1:42:41.760]  and they never own up to any of it in fact they set up there like they're
[1:42:41.760 --> 1:42:45.200]  god and they're clean and they're good that makes me want to throw up well you
[1:42:45.200 --> 1:42:48.640]  know that's what really really like started to affect me
[1:42:48.640 --> 1:42:52.720]  you know when i was in prison and i'm like once everything came out and i
[1:42:52.720 --> 1:42:56.080]  interviewed with the cia you know the cia came down to my jail cell
[1:42:56.080 --> 1:42:59.360]  let's let's talk about that but let's also go back to your trial when you
[1:42:59.360 --> 1:43:02.800]  learn about all this with gary webb tell that story because web talked about and
[1:43:02.800 --> 1:43:05.520]  you've how you got threatened out in the hall threatened to kill anyone stuff
[1:43:05.520 --> 1:43:09.120]  they didn't just threaten to kill us kids i mean the feds themselves that were
[1:43:09.120 --> 1:43:12.720]  there not just the cia they were basically all in on it
[1:43:12.720 --> 1:43:17.520]  b a i mean they sandbacked us doing trial we were going to trial
[1:43:17.520 --> 1:43:21.760]  so we have a uh there's a period in court where
[1:43:21.760 --> 1:43:24.880]  where you get to interview the informant because we never talk to the
[1:43:24.880 --> 1:43:27.200]  informant we don't know what the informant's going to say
[1:43:27.200 --> 1:43:30.000]  you don't have no clue about what the person who's going to testify against
[1:43:30.000 --> 1:43:34.080]  you're going to say so the court has a thing what they call a
[1:43:34.080 --> 1:43:37.920]  pre-trial hearing where the informant is supposed to be come
[1:43:37.920 --> 1:43:41.280]  to like a little room i couldn't be there but my lawyer is supposed to be there
[1:43:41.280 --> 1:43:45.760]  and gary was supposed to be there well anyway uh blend on comes in this hearing
[1:43:45.760 --> 1:43:49.280]  and when they get in the room and my lawyer wants to ask him some questions
[1:43:49.280 --> 1:43:52.880]  and the guy said everything that i got to say i'm going to say doing trial so we
[1:43:52.880 --> 1:43:56.880]  don't know what this guy is going to say so we start you're unable to ever do a
[1:43:56.880 --> 1:44:02.240]  deposition no deposition with this guy so when we get the trial my
[1:44:02.240 --> 1:44:05.440]  lawyer you don't have a clue what's going on all the information that gary has
[1:44:05.440 --> 1:44:08.800]  we don't have this information and gary's not giving it to us
[1:44:08.800 --> 1:44:12.880]  he didn't give us this information at first uh because gary knew i had the
[1:44:12.880 --> 1:44:16.560]  relationship with la times so uh i felt that gary was
[1:44:16.560 --> 1:44:20.560]  worried about me leaking his information to uh jesse
[1:44:20.560 --> 1:44:22.720]  cats at la times because you know me and jesse cats
[1:44:22.720 --> 1:44:25.920]  still had a relationship when we talked once in a while so gary didn't give it to
[1:44:25.920 --> 1:44:30.000]  us we start trial and in the middle of trial
[1:44:30.000 --> 1:44:35.680]  my lawyer keeps running back and forth to gary gary's in the audience so he's
[1:44:35.680 --> 1:44:40.640]  at the trial table with me and he gets up from the trial table when he goes and
[1:44:40.640 --> 1:44:43.680]  he talks to blend on and he goes back and he asks gary because gary's
[1:44:43.680 --> 1:44:47.360]  feeding him like little bits of pieces and that was smart that way the la
[1:44:47.360 --> 1:44:50.640]  times now admitted run by the cia the editor cia
[1:44:50.640 --> 1:44:54.160]  trying to cover all this up you didn't know that he could only ask it while it
[1:44:54.160 --> 1:44:57.920]  was happening live so he would get the intel and they couldn't spin it
[1:44:57.920 --> 1:45:01.120]  exactly i mean i'm he had to do it like that almost
[1:45:01.120 --> 1:45:05.680]  because uh i may have given it to jesse not knowing
[1:45:05.680 --> 1:45:09.120]  you know because i didn't know the scope of this believe me i had no idea you
[1:45:09.120 --> 1:45:13.200]  know they tried to say that i told gary how to put it together
[1:45:13.200 --> 1:45:16.640]  you know they said that right yes they did oh rick ross dreamed us all up and
[1:45:16.640 --> 1:45:20.000]  put this together and fed it to gary and got gary to buy into it but i didn't
[1:45:20.000 --> 1:45:23.520]  know none of this they they gave me more credit than i deserve
[1:45:23.520 --> 1:45:27.920]  who would have thought the la times you know was involved you know
[1:45:27.920 --> 1:45:30.560]  that's how it works so you're going to take down a culture and bring in and
[1:45:30.560 --> 1:45:33.600]  make trillions off drugs you got to run the newspapers
[1:45:33.600 --> 1:45:36.720]  yeah you have to you have to and and that's what's so amazing even right
[1:45:36.720 --> 1:45:40.480]  now today you know it's it baffles me that people don't know this
[1:45:40.480 --> 1:45:44.000]  i'm like the cia admitted it they got they got a report you can go to their
[1:45:44.000 --> 1:45:47.200]  website and reporters on their website and and people don't know it by their
[1:45:47.200 --> 1:45:52.400]  inspector general please continue so we in court and gary's
[1:45:52.400 --> 1:45:55.680]  action uh my lawyer this and then the judge recognized what's going on and
[1:45:55.680 --> 1:45:58.160]  she was like well why you keep talking to this reporter
[1:45:58.160 --> 1:46:01.200]  why are you running back and forth to him in the courtroom uh
[1:46:01.200 --> 1:46:04.720]  i want you to stand here and and do this we're not on a fishing exposition
[1:46:04.720 --> 1:46:08.000]  because um you know gary was asking about certain names and rick
[1:46:08.000 --> 1:46:11.120]  erie mutes and then blandon talks about well
[1:46:11.120 --> 1:46:14.560]  my boss goes on a fishing trip with george bush and when they come back
[1:46:14.560 --> 1:46:19.840]  they say the ends justify the means and all this type of stuff but this stuff
[1:46:19.840 --> 1:46:23.760]  is still not making it's all macchiabella to me it doesn't make any sense you know
[1:46:23.760 --> 1:46:26.880]  i don't know i mean i'm learning about the court system while i'm
[1:46:26.880 --> 1:46:31.520]  near but you know i'm not a lawyer i'm um um
[1:46:31.520 --> 1:46:35.280]  still a novice you know this is a guy that couldn't read you know uh
[1:46:35.280 --> 1:46:40.640]  two years ago i couldn't read so um i'm still learning what's going on so then
[1:46:40.640 --> 1:46:43.600]  eventually we finish trial they give me the life sentence
[1:46:43.600 --> 1:46:47.680]  in a couple months later gary's story come out
[1:46:47.680 --> 1:46:51.200]  gary sends me a copy i get a copy the day before it comes out
[1:46:51.200 --> 1:46:54.880]  uh i call gary on the phone and then we start to talk and he starts to tell me
[1:46:54.880 --> 1:46:57.840]  you know about the cia being involved about the conscious because you know i
[1:46:57.840 --> 1:47:01.840]  really didn't know what the conscious was i had no clue what the conscious was
[1:47:01.840 --> 1:47:05.440]  and definitely did not know that they were back by
[1:47:05.440 --> 1:47:08.960]  the cia and and and ronald reagan and george bush had no clue that they was
[1:47:08.960 --> 1:47:13.120]  back by that i did know that denillo and and these guys and all of his friends
[1:47:13.120 --> 1:47:18.640]  were fighting a war in their country uh didn't know what the war was over i mean
[1:47:18.640 --> 1:47:22.240]  you're talking to a body guy that's illiterate still i'm still illiterate
[1:47:22.240 --> 1:47:25.200]  had never read a book well this stuff's complex and you're busy anyways
[1:47:25.200 --> 1:47:28.560]  it's come out ronald reagan not defending him he didn't know it was george
[1:47:28.560 --> 1:47:31.920]  herbert walker bush running all that as well keeping it from him so if the
[1:47:31.920 --> 1:47:34.560]  president didn't know rick you can't blame you for not knowing
[1:47:34.560 --> 1:47:38.720]  yeah so i'm still a novice to all the stuff that's going on
[1:47:38.720 --> 1:47:42.000]  but when it comes out gary runs it down to him and he starts to tell me and i'm
[1:47:42.000 --> 1:47:47.840]  like oh this got gary he's out there so the next thing i know a couple
[1:47:47.840 --> 1:47:52.960]  days later uh the oig is at my cell the cia is at
[1:47:52.960 --> 1:47:57.200]  my cell uh congresswoman maxine waters is there
[1:47:57.200 --> 1:48:00.720]  uh i mean it just starts to pour all these people are coming and coming i'm
[1:48:00.720 --> 1:48:04.480]  like what is going on let's talk about that what did the cia say to you when
[1:48:04.480 --> 1:48:07.520]  they came to your cell well they start to talk to me about how
[1:48:07.520 --> 1:48:11.840]  much drugs i sold who did i get my drugs from was uh
[1:48:11.840 --> 1:48:15.520]  did i have a contract with the cia and i was like no i ain't never been with the
[1:48:15.520 --> 1:48:18.960]  cia i don't know nothing about the cia they know you were compartmentalized
[1:48:18.960 --> 1:48:22.320]  they wanted to act like well he he he refutes the story
[1:48:22.320 --> 1:48:26.240]  kind of yeah that's that's what they pretty much said and uh
[1:48:26.240 --> 1:48:30.080]  did i get drugs from denil obland on how long had i been getting drugs from him
[1:48:30.080 --> 1:48:33.520]  uh that kind of stuff and i was like well you guys want me to talk to you
[1:48:33.520 --> 1:48:37.200]  uh why you don't straighten my court system out you know i got a life sentence
[1:48:37.200 --> 1:48:40.160]  uh will you straighten my court sentence out no we don't have anything to do
[1:48:40.160 --> 1:48:43.120]  with that we're not going to help you with your courts uh if you want to talk
[1:48:43.120 --> 1:48:47.680]  to us you just talk to us and this is how we're going to do it so uh
[1:48:47.680 --> 1:48:50.400]  that was pretty much that by the way they could have snapped their fingers and
[1:48:50.400 --> 1:48:53.440]  got you out a few years yeah yeah i already know
[1:48:53.440 --> 1:48:56.960]  but you know i wasn't cooperating with what they wanted me to to do so
[1:48:56.960 --> 1:49:00.000]  that's why you're a you know a hero overall because more and more
[1:49:00.000 --> 1:49:03.520]  you had a chance once it came out that it had been going on to throw gary
[1:49:03.520 --> 1:49:08.000]  webbing of the bus you wouldn't do it oh no no i i um i respect what gary does
[1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:11.360]  uh what he did and and even well you're right he's still alive
[1:49:11.360 --> 1:49:15.760]  i mean he's he's living on through yeah through a story absolutely you know um
[1:49:15.760 --> 1:49:19.120]  and and people you know they always picking here and there about
[1:49:19.120 --> 1:49:23.360]  every little thing you know like um even with the movie you know
[1:49:23.360 --> 1:49:26.880]  what you didn't like about the movie how did you like this and and you know it's
[1:49:26.880 --> 1:49:30.880]  like hey it's it's it's his spirit that that that people have to respect i mean
[1:49:30.880 --> 1:49:35.360]  this guy stood up for justice he felt that even though i was
[1:49:35.360 --> 1:49:40.400]  selling drugs that i still had rights that that that had to be respected and
[1:49:40.400 --> 1:49:44.960]  and that we should be treated you shouldn't be in jail when the cio
[1:49:44.960 --> 1:49:49.120]  cia sold you the drugs i've had the pilot on that was flying and in
[1:49:49.120 --> 1:49:53.920]  to the military base yeah that they were then delivering to you every week
[1:49:53.920 --> 1:49:57.120]  yeah and and and what i don't i don't i didn't feel that way about myself but i
[1:49:57.120 --> 1:50:00.960]  feel that way about guys right now in prison because right now we have guys
[1:50:00.960 --> 1:50:03.760]  in prison it's been in prison 25 and 30 years
[1:50:03.760 --> 1:50:08.720]  never shot anybody never carried a gun all he did was sold a lot of drugs and
[1:50:08.720 --> 1:50:11.120]  got a lot of time and they're still there right now today
[1:50:11.120 --> 1:50:14.160]  yeah for those that don't know the guns are down at the street level where
[1:50:14.160 --> 1:50:18.160]  dealers might get robbed or something up at the top other than bodyguards
[1:50:18.160 --> 1:50:22.720]  i mean were there ever guns no no you didn't really need guns
[1:50:22.720 --> 1:50:25.360]  the only time i would carry a gun if i went to a club or something like that
[1:50:25.360 --> 1:50:28.800]  and i think somebody might be going to kidnap me or try to do something to me
[1:50:28.800 --> 1:50:34.160]  was the only self-defense never i mean if you got more money and you can
[1:50:34.160 --> 1:50:37.520]  ever spend what are you going to do with a gun you know guys who carry guns
[1:50:37.520 --> 1:50:40.480]  robbing people that that's because they're broke when you got playing money
[1:50:40.480 --> 1:50:42.720]  the only way you want a gun is to protect your money
[1:50:42.720 --> 1:50:47.200]  that's right that's what good guns are for is protecting your family
[1:50:47.200 --> 1:50:51.040]  and your money i got my mind on my family

[1:56:45.360 --> 1:56:49.040]  he was talking to me he wasn't ready to come back on until his new book came
[1:56:49.040 --> 1:56:53.680]  out he wanted me to put an online bibliography up of a bunch of documents
[1:56:53.680 --> 1:56:57.440]  uh he was talking to a bunch of other people he was talking to you
[1:56:57.440 --> 1:57:01.760]  i talked to you right after they killed him or he committed suicide as they say
[1:57:01.760 --> 1:57:05.920]  in jail you didn't buy it he he told you they've been breaking this house he'd
[1:57:05.920 --> 1:57:09.840]  had to move they threatened him i liked how the movie basically
[1:57:09.840 --> 1:57:12.720]  implies they killed him but it ends before they kill him
[1:57:12.720 --> 1:57:15.920]  this story him shooting himself twice in the head
[1:57:15.920 --> 1:57:19.600]  what did gary webb talk to you before he died i mean he talked to me about
[1:57:19.600 --> 1:57:23.200]  how he was he was very excited he had all the proof to back up what he said
[1:57:23.200 --> 1:57:26.240]  yeah he told me he was going to keep going that uh he was going to get to the
[1:57:26.240 --> 1:57:28.880]  bottom of it and that he wasn't going to stop until
[1:57:28.880 --> 1:57:32.640]  he was done with it and uh he did tell me about a new book that he was working on
[1:57:32.640 --> 1:57:35.440]  and he asked me if i would be a part of that as well
[1:57:35.440 --> 1:57:39.920]  so i mean you know i was talking to kevin boof when kevin boof is the one that
[1:57:39.920 --> 1:57:43.200]  told me about what happened uh to gary and i was like
[1:57:43.200 --> 1:57:46.880]  what i couldn't believe it and uh right after when i spoke to you you know
[1:57:46.880 --> 1:57:50.400]  um and that's when you asked me you know on air uh
[1:57:50.400 --> 1:57:53.680]  was i thinking about committing suicide and i was like no what did that come
[1:57:53.680 --> 1:57:56.560]  from and i didn't really understand what she was doing until after i went back
[1:57:56.560 --> 1:57:59.440]  to myself and i thought about it what you were doing was
[1:57:59.440 --> 1:58:03.440]  making sure that everybody knew that i was thinking right that i wasn't
[1:58:03.440 --> 1:58:07.520]  planning on killing myself and and that i was stable and and whatnot yeah i'm
[1:58:07.520 --> 1:58:10.320]  never going to commit suicide you're never going to commit suicide
[1:58:10.320 --> 1:58:14.720]  no no never so so so you get shot twice in the head and you didn't do it i love
[1:58:14.720 --> 1:58:20.320]  my absolutely if i get shot once in the head gary webb you think they killed him
[1:58:20.320 --> 1:58:25.040]  uh i mean it looks like it to me i mean just just i'm not a forensic or anything
[1:58:25.040 --> 1:58:28.080]  like that so i really can't say if it's possible that somebody can shoot
[1:58:28.080 --> 1:58:31.840]  themselves in the head twice uh but it just seems odd to me that
[1:58:31.840 --> 1:58:35.520]  that a person could take a gun and because i shot a gun before and you
[1:58:35.520 --> 1:58:39.120]  shoot it and the gun does like this here so can you take stay there we're talking

[2:01:09.680 --> 2:01:14.560]  knowing the story as good as i do i was really freaked out because it was so
[2:01:14.560 --> 2:01:17.760]  accurate obviously they couldn't show everything but it was so out they really
[2:01:17.760 --> 2:01:22.080]  i think captured his spirit i really admire renner now i do too i do too and
[2:01:22.080 --> 2:01:25.520]  i met renner at the at the at the screen in me him and michael and uh the
[2:01:25.520 --> 2:01:29.440]  director and uh the head producer we all took photos and whatnot and it was
[2:01:29.440 --> 2:01:34.000]  just like uh almost like gary was there you know i'm saying gary's wife was
[2:01:34.000 --> 2:01:38.240]  there his kids were there so for me it was a an opportunity to meet
[2:01:38.240 --> 2:01:41.840]  uh people that i had never met before but i spoke on the phone
[2:01:41.840 --> 2:01:46.560]  and uh to meet his wife and his kids and and just the whole environment was like
[2:01:46.560 --> 2:01:50.880]  man everything that gary was was doing was was still alive you know to know
[2:01:50.880 --> 2:01:54.240]  that he hadn't died i wonder how his so-called friends at the
[2:01:54.240 --> 2:01:58.560]  newspaper that turned to their back on him uh i wonder how they feel now being
[2:01:58.560 --> 2:02:03.040]  so famous in this film wow yeah you know uh i spoke to jesse
[2:02:03.040 --> 2:02:06.400]  cats about his role you know inside the film and uh
[2:02:06.400 --> 2:02:10.720]  you know we have get jesse inside of our documentary where he he apologizes
[2:02:10.720 --> 2:02:15.680]  for uh basically being a hired gun and uh and gunning gary down he was saying
[2:02:15.680 --> 2:02:19.360]  that that's one of the lowest points that that he filled in his journalism
[2:02:19.360 --> 2:02:23.360]  uh that he that he did that now was the editor of the la times it was
[2:02:23.360 --> 2:02:27.600]  the guy and it may have been but yeah but he hired jesse
[2:02:27.600 --> 2:02:29.920]  no i understand but it actually comes out in the film
[2:02:29.920 --> 2:02:32.800]  because they're saying well the la times says says this he was well yeah but he's
[2:02:32.800 --> 2:02:38.000]  cia and of course he was never discredited
[2:02:38.000 --> 2:02:42.320]  that's why they had to kill him because they tried to kill him in the media
[2:02:42.320 --> 2:02:44.960]  but and then that didn't work so they just killed him well you know the internet
[2:02:44.960 --> 2:02:48.000]  saved the story i mean if it wasn't for the internet
[2:02:48.000 --> 2:02:51.120]  the story would have been dead you know from from the start
[2:02:51.120 --> 2:02:54.960]  but uh the thing about it was so good is that uh it was the first time a major
[2:02:54.960 --> 2:02:58.320]  newspaper had ever released a story on the new on the internet
[2:02:58.320 --> 2:03:02.640]  so um once it hit that internet you know it just started going from person to
[2:03:02.640 --> 2:03:05.920]  person to person to person and uh you know another thing it was the first
[2:03:05.920 --> 2:03:09.120]  time that blacks had ever really came out on the internet the way they did
[2:03:09.120 --> 2:03:12.240]  they really came out and uh oh let's talk about that when we come back and
[2:03:12.240 --> 2:03:16.160]  then we'll get into um the hip hop and your message to the young
[2:03:16.160 --> 2:03:18.960]  people but we ought to find those clips like where
[2:03:18.960 --> 2:03:22.400]  mike rupert confronts the cia director maxine waters does
[2:03:22.400 --> 2:03:25.680]  you can find it online like mike rupert confronts cia director maxine waters
[2:03:25.680 --> 2:03:29.120]  does and doge just shuts down and then had to quit after that
[2:03:29.120 --> 2:03:32.400]  maybe more mad they're like you put this on our streets that was powerful
[2:03:32.400 --> 2:03:37.040]  yeah yeah when he came down to south central at lock high school
[2:03:37.040 --> 2:03:40.320]  i want to get your take we'll start talking about that some well you know
[2:03:40.320 --> 2:03:43.680]  he came to south central or because it was so such an hour or in in south
[2:03:43.680 --> 2:03:47.120]  central la you know blacks were mobilizing and they wanted they wanted
[2:03:47.120 --> 2:03:50.960]  something done you know they want to answer people had kids in prison and
[2:03:50.960 --> 2:03:54.640]  uh i mean you know it really devastated the black community you know right
[2:03:54.640 --> 2:04:00.400]  now we have 600 000 uh black men in prison for selling uh uh drugs no
[2:04:00.400 --> 2:04:03.440]  violence you know not rapes not not robberies
[2:04:03.440 --> 2:04:06.480]  just just drugs you know marijuana and cocaine
[2:04:06.480 --> 2:04:11.360]  um and these people wanted the answers they want to know why were the kids
[2:04:11.360 --> 2:04:15.200]  taking away so long you know uh i have about 11 friends that's
[2:04:15.200 --> 2:04:20.320]  been in prison right now 26 years uh uh from selling drugs 20 maybe even 30
[2:04:20.320 --> 2:04:24.960]  some of them so uh people want answers and uh dutch felt that uh
[2:04:24.960 --> 2:04:28.320]  it would be better to address it than to let it keep simmering and uh
[2:04:28.320 --> 2:04:31.840]  a big mistake he made you know by coming to south central and and confronting
[2:04:31.840 --> 2:04:36.160]  those people because they really gave it to him we're gonna play the clips of
[2:04:36.160 --> 2:04:40.480]  mike repert and uh others and i guess it was it was maxine

[2:09:43.120 --> 2:09:47.600]  and of course it made deutch resign a few weeks later
[2:09:47.600 --> 2:09:51.520]  and then it caused the inspector general report and they admitted it it all
[2:09:51.520 --> 2:09:54.640]  came out that's the thing people say oh
[2:09:54.640 --> 2:09:58.160]  government involvement 911 will come out it has government involvement
[2:09:58.160 --> 2:10:01.600]  sterilizing people who come out it has government involvement shipping drugs
[2:10:01.600 --> 2:10:06.720]  and would come out it has it came out in the 60s on the opium
[2:10:06.720 --> 2:10:10.880]  the heroin in southeast asia it's come out in afghanistan
[2:10:10.880 --> 2:10:14.720]  it went from seven percent of world opium production in afghanistan
[2:10:14.720 --> 2:10:19.680]  to 93 percent that's the un's own report after our liberation of it
[2:10:19.680 --> 2:10:23.360]  i don't need to play the fox news clips again or cnn or abc them admitting our
[2:10:23.360 --> 2:10:27.120]  trips guard and grow the opium
[2:10:27.120 --> 2:10:31.200]  you understand that folks and then if your son or daughter is dumb enough
[2:10:31.200 --> 2:10:37.280]  to get on heroin god forbid or unlucky enough they're gonna throw them in
[2:10:37.280 --> 2:10:42.240]  jail when they shipped it in that's crazy
[2:10:42.240 --> 2:10:45.600]  that'd be like if if you were a mafia don and ordered one of your guys to go
[2:10:45.600 --> 2:10:48.480]  rob a bank and then the mafia don shows up in a police
[2:10:48.480 --> 2:10:52.640]  outfit and takes you to jail for robbing the bank when he publicly ordered
[2:10:52.640 --> 2:10:56.320]  him to do that fruay ricky ross is our guest he would
[2:10:56.320 --> 2:10:59.360]  to sell out gary webb and others so they kept him in prison a lot
[2:10:59.360 --> 2:11:03.360]  longer than he should have been there and again i don't glorify drug dealing
[2:11:03.360 --> 2:11:06.880]  but it's the fact that it's illegal that puts all this money into it you
[2:11:06.880 --> 2:11:09.680]  regulate it you make it a shameful thing to do you
[2:11:09.680 --> 2:11:12.000]  don't have all these hollywood movies promoting it
[2:11:12.000 --> 2:11:16.240]  on purpose to prime the pump and it will go away areas of europe have done that
[2:11:16.240 --> 2:11:20.640]  and drug abuse has gone down about 50 so it's because i don't like drugs folks i
[2:11:20.640 --> 2:11:24.640]  don't use drugs i get prescriptions sometimes you
[2:11:24.640 --> 2:11:27.920]  know if i'm sick i drink coffee i drink tea
[2:11:27.920 --> 2:11:31.440]  occasionally i drink beer or wine but i mean that's it
[2:11:31.440 --> 2:11:34.960]  it's the drug dealers they're currently operating in government big banks and
[2:11:34.960 --> 2:11:38.720]  then low-level ones they don't want it to be made legal or decriminalized
[2:11:38.720 --> 2:11:42.320]  rick ross is our guest we're going to be taking your phone calls coming up
[2:11:42.320 --> 2:11:44.800]  it's the sunday phone number today we're running the whole show out of our

[2:12:06.080 --> 2:12:10.240]  rick ross on the i w chats at real alex jones on twitter
[2:12:10.240 --> 2:12:13.920]  we've already got some of those questions pouring in rick
[2:12:13.920 --> 2:12:16.960]  uh other points you want to make and then i know you want to get into hip hop
[2:12:16.960 --> 2:12:23.280]  that you say uh is the new crack cocaine epidemic culture war machine and then
[2:12:23.280 --> 2:12:28.240]  i've got some amazing testimony i can give you uh on that exact
[2:12:28.240 --> 2:12:31.280]  fact backing up what you have to say tell folks what you told me
[2:12:31.280 --> 2:12:36.000]  off air well i i believe that what they've done is they've taken hip hop
[2:12:36.000 --> 2:12:39.440]  and they've made it glorious to be a drug dealer you know when i saw drugs
[2:12:39.440 --> 2:12:43.600]  i hid i didn't want anybody to know i sold drugs but now they got these guys
[2:12:43.600 --> 2:12:48.720]  who've never sold drugs technically you know one guy was a correctional officer
[2:12:48.720 --> 2:12:52.560]  who goes by the name of rick ross now he took my whole identity and the court
[2:12:52.560 --> 2:12:55.760]  said that he could do it and he could press around the country and say that
[2:12:55.760 --> 2:12:59.840]  he's me and take my whole life and use it and there was nothing i could do
[2:12:59.840 --> 2:13:03.680]  about it i can't stop him he even grew a beard just like you
[2:13:03.680 --> 2:13:07.840]  everything so now they take these guys and these guys
[2:13:07.840 --> 2:13:12.240]  said well i got to the position that i'm in right
[2:13:12.240 --> 2:13:16.480]  now today by selling drugs so the message that it tells our kids
[2:13:16.480 --> 2:13:22.240]  is that if you go out you sell drugs then you can become a great rock star like
[2:13:22.240 --> 2:13:26.720]  myself and never go to prison and i think that
[2:13:26.720 --> 2:13:32.160]  that's a false message to be given people who feel hopeless and notice
[2:13:32.160 --> 2:13:35.440]  they don't indict the people that are fake and claim all that no no they want
[2:13:35.440 --> 2:13:39.120]  them out there like a lantern fish has that light
[2:13:39.120 --> 2:13:42.400]  to get the little fish to swim over so they can eat them
[2:13:42.400 --> 2:13:46.320]  exactly and that's what i believe i mean if i were to ever if i were to go on
[2:13:46.320 --> 2:13:50.560]  tape and say oh yeah i sold 300 kilos of cocaine and now you got me admitting
[2:13:50.560 --> 2:13:54.240]  that i did that they would indict me for it but the way they're doing it now
[2:13:54.240 --> 2:13:57.120]  they say it's just art form it's just a form of art
[2:13:57.120 --> 2:14:01.040]  and i believe that it's it's sucking in our kids and and and
[2:14:01.040 --> 2:14:04.640]  you know you turn on the radio and it's it's just filled with it and what do you
[2:14:04.640 --> 2:14:07.360]  want to say to rick ross because you'll probably see this video
[2:14:07.360 --> 2:14:10.720]  well fake rick ross i would tell him that it's time
[2:14:10.720 --> 2:14:16.240]  to change uh that it's time to uh tell the kids the truth you know and let
[2:14:16.240 --> 2:14:20.880]  him know that um technically he's never sold drugs
[2:14:20.880 --> 2:14:24.320]  and that he didn't get his money from selling drugs that
[2:14:24.320 --> 2:14:28.400]  universal gave him the money to do the things that he's doing that it's okay
[2:14:28.400 --> 2:14:31.040]  to to admit that that that you never did that
[2:14:31.040 --> 2:14:34.320]  and not that our kids believe that they can go out and sell drugs
[2:14:34.320 --> 2:14:38.640]  and never pay a penalty for doing that
[2:14:40.800 --> 2:14:44.320]  does it make you angry to see him doing that
[2:14:44.320 --> 2:14:50.560]  well really the whole culture i mean i i'm i'm disappointing the whole culture
[2:14:50.560 --> 2:14:53.280]  really not not really him because i don't think that he
[2:14:53.280 --> 2:14:58.320]  understands what he's doing uh to him i believe that that
[2:14:58.320 --> 2:15:05.120]  he's making a living and he's almost like i was when i sold drugs
[2:15:05.120 --> 2:15:09.120]  so he don't understand the but you were actually doing it and taking the risk
[2:15:09.120 --> 2:15:12.560]  he's out there selling this culture in this idea where young kids are going to
[2:15:12.560 --> 2:15:16.560]  go out and get their lives ruined or killed in my book that's a lot worse
[2:15:16.560 --> 2:15:19.440]  than what you did it it possibly at least you had your
[2:15:19.440 --> 2:15:22.560]  butt hanging out there yeah and and they're they're getting it to
[2:15:22.560 --> 2:15:26.000]  maybe even more people than i did i mean you know we'll notice though
[2:15:26.000 --> 2:15:28.880]  even though these guys are fake gangsters they're always getting shot up and
[2:15:28.880 --> 2:15:31.840]  killed because real gangsters come after them or
[2:15:31.840 --> 2:15:35.600]  other people that think their gangsters come after them it's totally sick
[2:15:35.600 --> 2:15:39.040]  it is it is but then you know you go to our schools and and guess who you hear
[2:15:39.040 --> 2:15:43.040]  on the radio uh plan on the in a high school gym on the on the
[2:15:43.040 --> 2:15:47.680]  on the turntables guess who you hear on her jz well i'm glad you're speaking
[2:15:47.680 --> 2:15:50.880]  to high schools and colleges we need to get you to just thousands of them we
[2:15:50.880 --> 2:15:54.720]  need to shut this down well you know it is and and you say that that it's it's
[2:15:54.720 --> 2:15:58.960]  harder for me to get in with my message than it is for them they'll pay these
[2:15:58.960 --> 2:16:02.480]  guys a hundred thousand dollars to come near
[2:16:02.480 --> 2:16:06.960]  and tell the kids how much drugs they sold and how glorious it is to sell drugs
[2:16:06.960 --> 2:16:11.920]  and they don't even want me on campus because you're going to tell them it's
[2:16:11.920 --> 2:16:14.720]  the government it'll ruin your life don't touch it
[2:16:14.720 --> 2:16:18.080]  and by the way go to prison forever if you don't and it's that message that
[2:16:18.080 --> 2:16:21.200]  will keep kids off drugs not the one of all it's
[2:16:21.200 --> 2:16:25.200]  sexy and fun you want to get involved in this this is how you really start
[2:16:25.200 --> 2:16:27.760]  rolling and getting all the chicks and everything no you're not going to get
[2:16:27.760 --> 2:16:30.560]  any of that you're gonna end up getting tb in a prison cell
[2:16:30.560 --> 2:16:36.960]  exactly and and and gets your lights cut off at seven o'clock at night
[2:16:36.960 --> 2:16:43.360]  told when to get up in the morning when to go to bed and how to live your life

[2:16:57.920 --> 2:17:01.840]  skillful job because people on the street when they get 35 dollars an hour to do

[2:24:21.360 --> 2:24:24.000]  next segment rick had more he wanted to say about quote
[2:24:24.000 --> 2:24:27.760]  dumbing down he was describing it like well i guess training wheels on the
[2:24:27.760 --> 2:24:30.720]  kids right into prison uh get more into that rick rosh who's
[2:24:30.720 --> 2:24:34.240]  talking about hip hop and how they program the kids on how they're supposed
[2:24:34.240 --> 2:24:37.360]  to act well you know like myself alex they made me
[2:24:37.360 --> 2:24:40.560]  believe that that i was dumb that i couldn't read
[2:24:40.560 --> 2:24:44.000]  uh and you know people ask me all the time who wasn't was it my mom
[2:24:44.000 --> 2:24:47.760]  who didn't teach me how to read was it the school well i don't really know
[2:24:47.760 --> 2:24:53.120]  but what i do know is that i had come up with a mentality about myself
[2:24:53.120 --> 2:24:59.840]  that that i was dumb that i was stupid that all i should be was a thug
[2:24:59.840 --> 2:25:07.200]  and that thugging was cool and when i looked around from my prison cell and
[2:25:07.200 --> 2:25:10.800]  i started to look at all my friends that they all thought the same way
[2:25:10.800 --> 2:25:16.640]  and it was this programming that put us in this position
[2:25:16.640 --> 2:25:22.240]  that dealing drugs and gang banging was easy for us to accept and i believe
[2:25:22.240 --> 2:25:26.160]  that hip hop is doing that right now but on a more massive scale
[2:25:26.160 --> 2:25:30.640]  um the kids now they wear their pants like we used to
[2:25:30.640 --> 2:25:34.880]  um they talk to things that we said they're ready for prison
[2:25:34.880 --> 2:25:39.360]  absolutely they're ready to be punked absolutely absolutely
[2:25:39.360 --> 2:25:42.960]  it's at an all-time high right it must be a joke to the cia mind controllers they
[2:25:42.960 --> 2:25:46.320]  have the young guys already wearing their pants saying hey i'm ready to be
[2:25:46.320 --> 2:25:49.920]  raped i mean i mean i mean they must be really proud of
[2:25:49.920 --> 2:25:54.560]  of the masterful job they've done and now they're deploying that hip hop culture
[2:25:54.560 --> 2:25:57.680]  into everything it's it's it's it's it's taking over
[2:25:57.680 --> 2:26:01.840]  oh absolutely endorsements i mean big big companies you know companies that
[2:26:01.840 --> 2:26:04.960]  wouldn't touch uh that type of lifestyle before you know
[2:26:04.960 --> 2:26:08.400]  is is is all over they don't want to have kids wearing sports jackets and doing
[2:26:08.400 --> 2:26:11.360]  well and you've got a future in your vet no you're crap
[2:26:11.360 --> 2:26:14.960]  and and now the rock and roll musics oh we're all dead we have no future humans
[2:26:14.960 --> 2:26:17.600]  are crud they need us to feel bad about ourselves
[2:26:17.600 --> 2:26:21.280]  and then we're hurting the earth so we roll over and basically become slaves
[2:26:21.280 --> 2:26:24.240]  absolutely other points you wanted to make before we go to break and that's
[2:26:24.240 --> 2:26:27.280]  and that's that's the point that i believe right now that our kids are in
[2:26:27.280 --> 2:26:30.320]  and and that's why i'm out here on the streets working to let them know that
[2:26:30.320 --> 2:26:33.840]  that that you know i couldn't read but i eventually
[2:26:33.840 --> 2:26:37.040]  started doing law you know i i found the issue that
[2:26:37.040 --> 2:26:41.600]  eventually helped me get out of prison so uh you know i wrote a book now
[2:26:41.600 --> 2:26:45.280]  um and a couple and you're here warning people about drugs right now
[2:26:45.280 --> 2:26:48.560]  absolutely and that's what matters is you've changed you understand what you
[2:26:48.560 --> 2:26:51.040]  did wrong and that's more valuable than somebody
[2:26:51.040 --> 2:26:53.760]  that never even went through the trials and tribulations you're a veteran
[2:26:53.760 --> 2:26:57.760]  right a veteran of this tyranny and you're here seeing through the matrix now
[2:26:57.760 --> 2:27:00.960]  that's a beautiful thing it's like christ is on the cross and
[2:27:00.960 --> 2:27:04.160]  he's there next to the thief and everything and the thief apologizes
[2:27:04.160 --> 2:27:07.920]  accepts it his heart's right and christ says tonight you'll be with me in
[2:27:07.920 --> 2:27:11.600]  paradise but the soldiers and everybody they just
[2:27:11.600 --> 2:27:14.560]  went along with it yeah they think they're winners in this world
[2:27:14.560 --> 2:27:18.960]  and they're not absolutely
[2:27:19.440 --> 2:27:23.840]  well we've got to warn the young people to never use drugs the first time i mean
[2:27:23.840 --> 2:27:27.760]  marijuana is a gateway but that doesn't mean we shouldn't decriminalize it just
[2:27:27.760 --> 2:27:31.360]  so they can't throw you in jail but the whole drug culture is ruining people
[2:27:31.360 --> 2:27:35.040]  uh and the prescription drugs are pushing on kids in the schools
[2:27:35.040 --> 2:27:38.560]  are worse than the illegal drugs and just stay away from them
[2:27:38.560 --> 2:27:42.160]  and realize you're not empty if you get bad grades and then so you got to go to
[2:27:42.160 --> 2:27:45.680]  the dark side uh you're not empty just because you don't have a bunch of money
[2:27:45.680 --> 2:27:50.000]  you can paint you can music you can go out and help people
[2:27:50.000 --> 2:27:53.680]  you can you that's what's going to empower you
[2:27:53.680 --> 2:27:57.760]  is is going out and standing up to bullies not just feeling bad because you
[2:27:57.760 --> 2:28:02.240]  don't live like people on television yeah we all can't be on television
[2:28:02.240 --> 2:28:06.080]  it's crazy that that they tell us that you know if you don't have a pair of
[2:28:06.080 --> 2:28:10.080]  Georgians that you're not special well i mean i was happier before i had all
[2:28:10.080 --> 2:28:13.520]  this responsibility and was quote on radio and tv and barely had money to buy
[2:28:13.520 --> 2:28:16.560]  three pairs of shoes a year even though that was rich compared to poor people
[2:28:16.560 --> 2:28:19.600]  i mean i was totally happy i was thinking back to the years when i was
[2:28:19.600 --> 2:28:22.240]  you know out of high school and stuff and our parents were giving me no help
[2:28:22.240 --> 2:28:25.520]  because i didn't ask for it really and i was so poor it was the happiest time of
[2:28:25.520 --> 2:28:28.480]  my life without all these responsibilities and the rest of it
[2:28:28.480 --> 2:28:31.760]  and i'm not saying people shouldn't become successful it's just that
[2:28:31.760 --> 2:28:36.000]  what matters is is that you're a good person that's the real value it is it is
[2:28:36.000 --> 2:28:38.960]  and that you care about others because when you don't care about other people
[2:28:38.960 --> 2:28:43.120]  then i believe that you're the worst
[2:28:43.120 --> 2:28:45.760]  and a lot of people that that's in power right now they don't care about
[2:28:45.760 --> 2:28:49.680]  anything but your dollars you know like they enjoy hurting people
[2:28:49.680 --> 2:28:53.520]  yeah i mean it's a diabolical plan to ship heroin in to get millions of
[2:28:53.520 --> 2:28:57.040]  americans addicted from the fifties on and then to bring in cocaine weaponized
[2:28:57.040 --> 2:29:01.200]  it is crack which is a cia recipe that was declassified and to deploy it right
[2:29:01.200 --> 2:29:05.600]  into black neighborhoods i mean that's a nasty thing to do
[2:29:05.600 --> 2:29:10.080]  it is absolutely to people that doesn't have that that's hopeless and then to
[2:29:10.080 --> 2:29:13.040]  show them thug culture because let me tell you you know i'm
[2:29:13.040 --> 2:29:16.560]  downtown austin and there's you know basically i call them black clan
[2:29:16.560 --> 2:29:19.600]  members whatever just black thug culture there's white thug culture as
[2:29:19.600 --> 2:29:22.160]  well but they've been sold it's okay to hate white people
[2:29:22.160 --> 2:29:25.680]  i mean it's you know it's but i don't i see the plan though i see the whole
[2:29:25.680 --> 2:29:29.360]  programming to make them like that and to make them hate me and then i
[2:29:29.360 --> 2:29:33.120]  realize how it's all to divide everybody so the system can manage us
[2:29:33.120 --> 2:29:36.400]  yeah i mean that's diabolical absolutely
[2:29:36.400 --> 2:29:40.400]  that is sick that is mind control so we've got to transcend it ladies and
[2:29:40.400 --> 2:29:42.880]  gentlemen and defeat it we'll get your take on what i just said when we come
[2:29:42.880 --> 2:29:45.280]  back rick ross go right to your phone calls and your twitter
[2:29:45.280 --> 2:29:49.920]  questions i'll stop hogging him right now his website is i am the real rick
[2:29:49.920 --> 2:29:54.240]  ross dot com we're on the march the empires on the run
[2:29:54.240 --> 2:29:59.040]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[2:29:59.040 --> 2:30:06.080]  aging starts at the cellular level when cells become toxic they die early and
[2:30:06.080 --> 2:30:09.840]  aging sets in in the past decade we have witnessed
[2:30:09.840 --> 2:30:13.360]  unparalleled scientific discoveries during that period
[2:30:13.360 --> 2:30:17.280]  key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth
[2:30:17.280 --> 2:30:22.160]  nerve growth and rejuvenation but no one has put together a formula that
[2:30:22.160 --> 2:30:26.720]  focuses directly on brain health nerve growth factors and optimizing your
[2:30:26.720 --> 2:30:30.960]  cellular energy at the same time we now have the synergistic solution

[2:33:27.680 --> 2:33:30.640]  those one other point we got talking about fluoride in the water
[2:33:30.640 --> 2:33:33.920]  what was the other point you wanted to make you were saying
[2:33:33.920 --> 2:33:37.120]  i lost my thought man we're having the real discussions here during the
[2:33:37.120 --> 2:33:39.920]  breaks i thought so many times for the just for the tv
[2:33:39.920 --> 2:33:42.800]  audience ought to have a button i can hit whenever i'm not eating or
[2:33:42.800 --> 2:33:46.080]  making a phone call where we can put live cams in here during the breaks
[2:33:46.080 --> 2:33:48.400]  yeah that's where the really good discussions are happening
[2:33:48.400 --> 2:33:51.360]  yeah that would be good that would be good but you know we don't touch on so
[2:33:51.360 --> 2:33:54.880]  many good points man and and i'm just excited you know that uh
[2:33:54.880 --> 2:33:58.240]  that you have me here and that we touching on some of these points you know
[2:33:58.240 --> 2:34:02.080]  one of them too you know obama he wrote in the 18 to one
[2:34:02.080 --> 2:34:06.000]  uh crack law you know where was 101 for crack and powder
[2:34:06.000 --> 2:34:09.680]  where it already been proven that powder and crack or identical drugs
[2:34:09.680 --> 2:34:13.200]  except one is smokable and one is not smokable
[2:34:13.200 --> 2:34:17.040]  um so about a year ago they changed at 18 to one
[2:34:17.040 --> 2:34:19.280]  but they should have made it 18 to one and then they should have made it
[2:34:19.280 --> 2:34:22.240]  retroactive you know say if a guy's been in jail
[2:34:22.240 --> 2:34:28.560]  25 or 30 years but if it was 18 to one he would only got five years in prison
[2:34:28.560 --> 2:34:31.760]  so they would hold him some time he would be released well i totally agree if
[2:34:31.760 --> 2:34:35.680]  you're non-violent you should be released period because the
[2:34:35.680 --> 2:34:39.280]  government shipped in to begin with it'd be like if your judge
[2:34:39.280 --> 2:34:43.360]  was the guy that sold you the cocaine and then now he's presiding over
[2:34:43.360 --> 2:34:47.280]  sending you to jail for life that's what it is it'd be like if
[2:34:47.280 --> 2:34:52.800]  hitler ran the nuremberg trials i mean it's just it's pure bull i mean
[2:34:52.800 --> 2:34:55.920]  end it yes it is and then they own the prisons
[2:34:55.920 --> 2:34:59.120]  i remember uh i've talked to two major rock stars
[2:34:59.120 --> 2:35:02.640]  uh and it's not the two that you've heard on the show
[2:35:02.640 --> 2:35:06.960]  i've talked to two major rock stars and then i've talked to some hip hop folks
[2:35:06.960 --> 2:35:09.680]  they all say that that they've heard the same stories
[2:35:09.680 --> 2:35:13.040]  and some of the memos have come out about the cia behind rock and roll to
[2:35:13.040 --> 2:35:15.840]  create the revolutions you know behind bringing the lsd in
[2:35:15.840 --> 2:35:19.920]  that's been declassified but in the early 90s they said look rocks going to be
[2:35:19.920 --> 2:35:22.800]  dead get ready we're going to bring in hip hop
[2:35:22.800 --> 2:35:26.400]  and we're going to gangsterize it this is from the guys upstairs
[2:35:26.400 --> 2:35:30.560]  the government wants this shumner redstone at viacom has been ordered to
[2:35:30.560 --> 2:35:33.440]  do this and they and big managers and people
[2:35:33.440 --> 2:35:36.640]  were all brought in and they said you better start flipping to this
[2:35:36.640 --> 2:35:40.080]  that's why you saw a lot of heavy metal guys start doing rap albums and
[2:35:40.080 --> 2:35:42.880]  you know you know getting other folks in with them and things because they were
[2:35:42.880 --> 2:35:45.120]  told we're going to play these on the record
[2:35:45.120 --> 2:35:49.040]  and we're going to put this on the air and then i talked about my personal
[2:35:49.040 --> 2:35:52.240]  self i experimented here and there once or
[2:35:52.240 --> 2:35:55.520]  twice with hard drugs always had such horrible hangovers that i'll be you know
[2:35:55.520 --> 2:35:59.040]  methamphetamine a couple times cocaine a few times i'm on record about that
[2:35:59.040 --> 2:36:02.720]  i just didn't like it yeah i've always been a nicotine alcohol type guy and
[2:36:02.720 --> 2:36:05.520]  that i've transcended pretty much as well don't even smoke cigars anymore
[2:36:05.520 --> 2:36:10.400]  always get back on cigarettes when i do but long story short
[2:36:10.400 --> 2:36:15.840]  uh sheriff McWhorter who later got busted he was flying drugs into the rock
[2:36:15.840 --> 2:36:18.080]  wall airport we lived in the richest county in
[2:36:18.080 --> 2:36:20.400]  texas right outside dallas rock on the lake
[2:36:20.400 --> 2:36:23.760]  and i would be at affluent people's houses for a party when their parents are
[2:36:23.760 --> 2:36:25.680]  out of town you know the cheerleader down the
[2:36:25.680 --> 2:36:28.480]  streets having a party all 14 year olds are over there
[2:36:28.480 --> 2:36:31.440]  and then there'd be 16 year olds and 18 year olds has come over
[2:36:31.440 --> 2:36:34.880]  wild parties you know pool parties and the police car would pull up
[2:36:34.880 --> 2:36:37.920]  and then they'd come in and go we got the weed we got the ecstasy we got the
[2:36:37.920 --> 2:36:41.360]  methamphetamine we got the and i'd be like whoa whoa
[2:36:41.360 --> 2:36:45.280]  you know and and because they had money and so many times the cops in cars
[2:36:45.280 --> 2:36:48.320]  would deliver the drugs so i'd get pulled over
[2:36:48.320 --> 2:36:52.400]  a couple years later when i was driving this is why we had to move to austin
[2:36:52.400 --> 2:36:55.520]  i've told that this has been an s choir it's been in texas monthly they didn't
[2:36:55.520 --> 2:36:58.000]  believe a lot of it went and checked it went wow there were a bunch of busts in
[2:36:58.000 --> 2:37:01.680]  it in the in the rock wall pd in the in the county and flying in cocaine i
[2:37:01.680 --> 2:37:05.280]  remember that i remember that it was in the newspapers in red
[2:37:05.280 --> 2:37:08.320]  so they were flooding it with drugs and they would want to search my car and i'd
[2:37:08.320 --> 2:37:12.080]  go man i saw you two years ago deliver drugs and they would
[2:37:12.080 --> 2:37:16.080]  beat me up take me to jail threaten to hang me told my dad's lawyer

[2:37:22.000 --> 2:37:25.600]  uh but again that's the big drug dealer busting a little drug dealer

[2:39:38.000 --> 2:39:41.040]  and how he stole your image i think you already answered that and do you like
[2:39:41.040 --> 2:39:45.440]  his music do you like his music i do i do you can't help it i mean
[2:39:45.440 --> 2:39:49.040]  they have a formula that they're doing with this music and and you know our
[2:39:49.040 --> 2:39:52.880]  heart beats off of a rhythm so they manipulate us yeah
[2:39:52.880 --> 2:39:56.880]  absolutely so and then you hear the music if you turn on the radio
[2:39:56.880 --> 2:39:59.920]  and and i don't really listen to the radio and i like it you know because you
[2:39:59.920 --> 2:40:02.880]  you can't help but hear this music everywhere you go
[2:40:02.880 --> 2:40:06.240]  you know you're an elevator you're here you're in the supermarket you ride down
[2:40:06.240 --> 2:40:08.960]  the street and somebody else is playing in the club that's what makes me mad is
[2:40:08.960 --> 2:40:12.320]  my kids can't help but like it absolutely and if the message was
[2:40:12.320 --> 2:40:14.720]  going to be great but it's weaponized the message is bad
[2:40:14.720 --> 2:40:18.320]  yeah it's not motivation uplifting you know telling that you can be somebody
[2:40:18.320 --> 2:40:20.400]  special and that you are special no matter what
[2:40:20.400 --> 2:40:23.760]  situation so it's like you got to be a gangster slinging a rock the hose that
[2:40:23.760 --> 2:40:26.480]  you know
[2:40:26.480 --> 2:40:32.400]  you got it yeah uh rick ross did you do any business with the cia

[2:41:50.560 --> 2:41:55.360]  liked that name because they they looked at me as as
[2:41:55.360 --> 2:41:59.600]  almost like a robin hood well rick ross rolls off the tongue it sounds cool

[2:42:24.000 --> 2:42:27.680]  and what he did is he got that love that the streets have for me
[2:42:27.680 --> 2:42:32.160]  you know because i was a gangster i was out there in the streets and and
[2:42:32.160 --> 2:42:37.920]  that's what they wanted and he fitted that role so
[2:42:37.920 --> 2:42:42.320]  what are some of the things that motivate you today kde ask
[2:42:42.320 --> 2:42:47.040]  well uh redemption you know to redeem myself uh

[2:43:12.880 --> 2:43:16.160]  hello rick my name is vladislav here in the battleground washington
[2:43:16.160 --> 2:43:20.720]  uh my my question is very basic to you um basically what motivated you to deal
[2:43:20.720 --> 2:43:24.720]  with drugs with the cia and afterwards what changed your mind but has
[2:43:24.720 --> 2:43:28.080]  anybody been listening he didn't know he was dealing drugs for the cia
[2:43:28.080 --> 2:43:32.240]  until it came out in court because that the operative that his was a supplier
[2:43:32.240 --> 2:43:36.800]  from the air force base uh hadn't told him that so so i don't mean to
[2:43:36.800 --> 2:43:41.120]  answer his question for you but yeah i mean what motivated you to deal drugs i
[2:43:41.120 --> 2:43:43.600]  think you said that money right poverty money
[2:43:43.600 --> 2:43:49.040]  yeah i was tired of uh my mom struggling and and not having food in the
[2:43:49.040 --> 2:43:52.480]  refrigerator uh you know uh there's been days that me and
[2:43:52.480 --> 2:43:55.040]  my brothers and sisters woke up and there was nothing in there to eat i've
[2:43:55.040 --> 2:43:57.520]  got a question to ask you thank you caller i appreciate it i'm trying to be
[2:43:57.520 --> 2:44:00.880]  mean he just answered that um
[2:44:00.880 --> 2:44:07.200]  what does your mother think kind of like that scarface story uh what does your
[2:44:07.200 --> 2:44:10.480]  mother think when suddenly you had all this money well you know my mom put me
[2:44:10.480 --> 2:44:13.680]  out of the house when she first found out i was dealing drugs you know my mom was
[2:44:13.680 --> 2:44:17.680]  a diehard christian and uh you know first thing came to her mind oh you're
[2:44:17.680 --> 2:44:22.880]  going to hell forever so uh she threw me out the house uh but when she did i was
[2:44:22.880 --> 2:44:27.920]  already i was already ghetto rich i had a hundred thousand dollars so everybody
[2:44:27.920 --> 2:44:32.640]  in the neighborhood wanted me to come to their house and stay uh
[2:44:32.640 --> 2:44:36.000]  but eventually she she started to succumb to the money
[2:44:36.000 --> 2:44:39.520]  you know uh i bought pool pits for the church and
[2:44:39.520 --> 2:44:43.360]  uh air conditioners and you know i remodeled her house where she didn't
[2:44:43.360 --> 2:44:46.400]  have holes in the floors and had exterminated you know put the tent
[2:44:46.400 --> 2:44:48.720]  over to get rid of the rats and the roaches and
[2:44:48.720 --> 2:44:54.320]  and uh i was still her son so no matter what happened you know she still
[2:44:54.320 --> 2:45:00.080]  loved me and and adored me so uh our relationship never changed that's right
[2:45:00.080 --> 2:45:04.480]  there's nothing more powerful than the flesh flesh of my flesh uh let's go
[2:45:04.480 --> 2:45:09.360]  to julio in wyome and julio welcome the airwaves with rick ross what up hudio
[2:45:09.360 --> 2:45:13.440]  hey what's going on rick ross uh i first learned about you in college when i was
[2:45:13.440 --> 2:45:17.360]  a sophomore when i first heard about ellis joe and i want to say
[2:45:17.360 --> 2:45:20.960]  god bless you for what you're doing and speaking out against the drug culture
[2:45:20.960 --> 2:45:26.560]  studying media in college it it's clear we have this predictive program society
[2:45:26.560 --> 2:45:30.240]  uh a quick story i want to share just living in wyoming for a couple months
[2:45:30.240 --> 2:45:34.160]  uh i i've interacted with someone who i work with at my radio station
[2:45:34.160 --> 2:45:39.360]  his brother-in-law he works for a pharmaceutical company and he legally i
[2:45:39.360 --> 2:45:45.040]  used air quotes on that legally purchases methamphetamines and cocaine
[2:45:45.040 --> 2:45:49.840]  for the big drug manufacturers and and they go all over the country to pick up
[2:45:49.840 --> 2:45:54.400]  legal purchase purchases but i i could completely agree with what you and
[2:45:54.400 --> 2:45:57.280]  alex are talking about with predictive programming there is a movie that came
[2:45:57.280 --> 2:46:01.840]  out what a couple years ago two guns with denzel washington and mark walbert
[2:46:01.840 --> 2:46:06.080]  and again they they kind of just threw it in our face they just admit the cias
[2:46:06.080 --> 2:46:10.240]  bringing the drugs in it's all just f flapping it in our face
[2:46:10.240 --> 2:46:14.080]  they admit the army the the air force they're all doing this my question to
[2:46:14.080 --> 2:46:18.560]  you rick ross is a what's what's one of the biggest
[2:46:18.560 --> 2:46:24.800]  keys for us to talk to the youth about drugs here in wyoming the native american
[2:46:24.800 --> 2:46:29.280]  culture they're in a huge rat hole because of methamphetamine use and
[2:46:29.280 --> 2:46:33.200]  and the bureau of indian affairs which is basically the in the fbi for
[2:46:33.200 --> 2:46:38.400]  for native americans uh they're the ones who are helping push methamphetamine
[2:46:38.400 --> 2:46:44.240]  used here so so how do how do we uh talk to to the people how do we even engage
[2:46:44.240 --> 2:46:48.960]  the police officers at schomburg illinois a big big supper of chicago
[2:46:48.960 --> 2:46:52.800]  recently they've been caught stealing drugs themselves and stealing it from
[2:46:52.800 --> 2:46:56.240]  drug dealers and pushing it on the culture well that's it and and and look
[2:46:56.240 --> 2:47:00.160]  they have to stop they got rid of alcohol prohibition
[2:47:00.160 --> 2:47:03.520]  now they brought in this new prohibition and now they want to grab our kids and
[2:47:03.520 --> 2:47:07.360]  it's just there's never enough and they laugh on tv and past obama care that's
[2:47:07.360 --> 2:47:10.560]  a giant screw job i mean this thing is out of control
[2:47:10.560 --> 2:47:14.640]  they're killing the golden goose rick ross how do we stop well i think what
[2:47:14.640 --> 2:47:18.080]  you're doing right now alex is is is a start this is how you you got to get
[2:47:18.080 --> 2:47:21.040]  started because you know you're talking about fighting the the thousand pound
[2:47:21.040 --> 2:47:24.800]  gorilla and you're not going to whoop him you know uh just go and head up with
[2:47:24.800 --> 2:47:27.920]  him and and you got you got to sit down and think and and talk like alex is
[2:47:27.920 --> 2:47:31.440]  doing right now and you know most people don't want to talk about these issues
[2:47:31.440 --> 2:47:34.800]  you know most right you got to exactly got to force it out there till everybody
[2:47:34.800 --> 2:47:39.200]  knows and it's starting to happen yeah and and and once you start to do that
[2:47:39.200 --> 2:47:42.880]  then you can start attacking it because when people are
[2:47:42.880 --> 2:47:45.920]  dumb and remember how i was i was dumb and literate
[2:47:45.920 --> 2:47:49.360]  you know i never read a book you know never heard alex jones and
[2:47:49.360 --> 2:47:53.120]  uh uh nothing i didn't know anything so anything that somebody brought to me i
[2:47:53.120 --> 2:47:55.760]  went for it you know they bring it to you oh this is for
[2:47:55.760 --> 2:47:59.120]  you it's good for you taking and using this is how you do it and and then you
[2:47:59.120 --> 2:48:02.880]  find yourself caught up in stuff that uh you never thought you could have been
[2:48:02.880 --> 2:48:06.640]  my my dad mom were big into history and so my dad would tell me when i was
[2:48:06.640 --> 2:48:09.760]  young no the government brings in the drugs here's the biggest brazinski's
[2:48:09.760 --> 2:48:14.080]  book where he admits it uh and and and when you're old enough read it
[2:48:14.080 --> 2:48:17.440]  and i mean and i just thought everybody knew this stuff and then there were the
[2:48:17.440 --> 2:48:21.520]  police dealing drugs just like my dad said and and then i've had serpico on
[2:48:21.520 --> 2:48:24.080]  what do you think about his story you know they they just police shot him in the
[2:48:24.080 --> 2:48:27.360]  face yeah i mean because he didn't want to deal
[2:48:27.360 --> 2:48:31.920]  drugs i mean he said the entire new york narcotics
[2:48:31.920 --> 2:48:34.800]  department and we're all dealing drugs wow i said how
[2:48:34.800 --> 2:48:39.840]  what percentage he said a hundred percent wow everyone he knew and then he was
[2:48:39.840 --> 2:48:42.800]  even letting him deal the drugs he just said i want and they still tried to
[2:48:42.800 --> 2:48:47.520]  kill him crazy absolutely crazy yeah it's

[3:01:05.760 --> 3:01:11.600]  the bigger picture uh as far as operation paper clip and the whole
[3:01:11.600 --> 3:01:15.760]  eugenics agenda the pharmaceutical industry sounding and
[3:01:15.760 --> 3:01:19.760]  a marvitt sanger wanted to eradicate sure are you aware that the nazi plan
[3:01:19.760 --> 3:01:22.880]  actually came from the us in england and so that's why
[3:01:22.880 --> 3:01:25.920]  so much of this is going on the secret testing the drugs
[3:01:25.920 --> 3:01:29.760]  is that it's an attack you know i didn't know that i'm
[3:01:29.760 --> 3:01:33.680]  totally uh well i'll give you a film called in game
[3:01:33.680 --> 3:01:36.640]  that i produced that just goes over their whole master plan the truth is

[3:01:40.240 --> 3:01:44.000]  talk to james and michigan you're on the air with rick ross
[3:01:44.000 --> 3:01:48.080]  hey rick i was just wondering i have a question for you want to preface by
[3:01:48.080 --> 3:01:52.080]  saying uh you know the mafia they would tell their
[3:01:52.080 --> 3:01:57.520]  members not to deal in that junk but they themselves through the french
[3:01:57.520 --> 3:02:02.240]  connection of one instance for dealing it themselves
[3:02:02.240 --> 3:02:06.960]  my question to you is had you ever been shaken down by the mob for making as
[3:02:06.960 --> 3:02:11.760]  much money as you did because they always want a cut
[3:02:11.760 --> 3:02:14.720]  and no i wasn't uh that's because they obviously knew
[3:02:14.720 --> 3:02:18.560]  that you were a ca condom the little mob doesn't mess with the real mob
[3:02:18.560 --> 3:02:21.760]  no they don't uh i mean i shouldn't speak for you why do you think they left
[3:02:21.760 --> 3:02:26.160]  you alone well well you know uh it's obviously i had i had
[3:02:26.160 --> 3:02:30.960]  ties that was too big even for them you know and i probably got rich so fast
[3:02:30.960 --> 3:02:34.720]  that that you know if you wasn't inside you really didn't know what i was
[3:02:34.720 --> 3:02:38.080]  doing you know yeah i mean exactly all these fake
[3:02:38.080 --> 3:02:41.040]  rappers say run around and show your wealth off you're going to get arrested
[3:02:41.040 --> 3:02:45.040]  in 10 minutes acting like that yeah i mean real drug dealers folks real mob
[3:02:45.040 --> 3:02:48.080]  chiefs and people are living in small houses and gated communities
[3:02:48.080 --> 3:02:51.280]  keeping their head down yeah nobody nobody if you didn't know me you didn't
[3:02:51.280 --> 3:02:54.880]  know i was rich i mean my family they they started to know that and they

[3:10:02.080 --> 3:10:06.240]  to get away from the drug culture i've got friends from like upstate new york
[3:10:06.240 --> 3:10:09.280]  that moved on here a decade ago they said they moved on here as well because
[3:10:09.280 --> 3:10:12.960]  upstate new york all the farmers and stuff are basically dead
[3:10:12.960 --> 3:10:16.640]  and now it's just empty shopping malls and
[3:10:16.640 --> 3:10:20.400]  everybody's on drugs basically is that what you're talking about
[3:10:20.400 --> 3:10:24.080]  it is yeah it's funny you say that i was going to mention a good friend of mine
[3:10:24.080 --> 3:10:27.920]  that moved here from kentucky you know we're in the telecom industry but
[3:10:27.920 --> 3:10:32.720]  his whole family were farmers and they can't raise
[3:10:32.720 --> 3:10:38.160]  farmers or or coal miners they can't make a living anymore because of all of
[3:10:38.160 --> 3:10:41.600]  the so-called you know green walls that have been put in
[3:10:41.600 --> 3:10:45.760]  and now everybody's uh you know a mess dealer there
[3:10:45.760 --> 3:10:52.720]  um or or grows pot the sixth thing about my situation is i have a
[3:10:52.720 --> 3:10:59.520]  in-laws actually ex-in-laws who were in the police department in new york city
[3:10:59.520 --> 3:11:03.520]  and they were at a very high level and always worked with drug enforcement
[3:11:03.520 --> 3:11:08.160]  agents whenever big buffs were going to take place well
[3:11:08.160 --> 3:11:12.480]  all of these guys that were in my family members in laws who
[3:11:12.480 --> 3:11:16.320]  were in the police department had these beautiful like mansion style houses
[3:11:16.320 --> 3:11:21.360]  and i would say you know to my wife i my ex-wife now i would say i know what
[3:11:21.360 --> 3:11:25.280]  your brother makes and there's no way that he could he can live that way
[3:11:25.280 --> 3:11:29.920]  and she said well they they make overtime and you know so after years and
[3:11:29.920 --> 3:11:33.280]  years i mean i'm 50 now this started when i was in my 30
[3:11:33.280 --> 3:11:36.800]  i would say look this there's absolutely no way
[3:11:36.800 --> 3:11:40.560]  that this guy can pull down the kind of money he's making
[3:11:40.560 --> 3:11:44.880]  on a salary even with overtime there's something wrong well
[3:11:44.880 --> 3:11:49.600]  we had cousins from my family died from drug overdoses and i would openly say
[3:11:49.600 --> 3:11:53.840]  at family parties and holidays to this guy i would say you know the main
[3:11:53.840 --> 3:11:56.800]  kingpin in the family how do you look at yourself
[3:11:56.800 --> 3:12:00.880]  knowing that you work with these people that bring this stuff into the country
[3:12:00.880 --> 3:12:04.000]  and it's not just in the poor black neighborhoods
[3:12:04.000 --> 3:12:07.760]  oh it's the rich neighborhoods black or white or Hispanic
[3:12:07.760 --> 3:12:11.200]  it's worse there because people got money that's what the drug deal is going on
[3:12:11.200 --> 3:12:14.640]  i know cops never rate those houses now that's that's the problem is that in
[3:12:14.640 --> 3:12:18.080]  those houses they don't get searched one so easy but in the black community
[3:12:18.080 --> 3:12:22.080]  they can go into a judge and say hey i saw this guy selling drugs and i saw
[3:12:22.080 --> 3:12:25.360]  this happening and then the cops just come in and rate your house
[3:12:25.360 --> 3:12:29.120]  but everybody knows that listen listen i use more drugs in black i know people
[3:12:29.120 --> 3:12:32.960]  that work at the fanciest hotel in austin i'll just leave it at that
[3:12:32.960 --> 3:12:36.480]  the one with the president's days if i shouldn't even get into this because
[3:12:36.480 --> 3:12:40.240]  the point is is that they'll catch people with drugs and they just the cops
[3:12:40.240 --> 3:12:43.440]  throw in the trash can because just because that place doesn't want to have
[3:12:43.440 --> 3:12:47.040]  a rep i mean that's how controlled stuff is yeah and then the
[3:12:47.040 --> 3:12:49.440]  awesome police department's one of the better ones in the country
[3:12:49.440 --> 3:12:51.760]  i mean they're not involved in a lot of corruption compared to other departments
[3:12:51.760 --> 3:12:54.400]  that we've looked at because i've really looked into it
[3:12:54.400 --> 3:12:58.320]  yeah but but still yeah the rich areas just get left alone basically oh
[3:12:58.320 --> 3:13:00.640]  absolutely and and and don't go to prison
[3:13:00.640 --> 3:13:03.920]  now now we we're not saying that that it's not in the white communities because
[3:13:03.920 --> 3:13:07.760]  it absolutely is but the blacks when it comes to prison time and in the court
[3:13:07.760 --> 3:13:10.400]  system that's what you're going to see in court i'll see the statistic i think a
[3:13:10.400 --> 3:13:13.600]  black person for drug crimes on average gets five times the sentence
[3:13:13.600 --> 3:13:17.520]  yeah they do it's exact exact same crime you can have this one of those judges
[3:13:17.520 --> 3:13:21.520]  thinking i mean they must be really racist
[3:13:21.520 --> 3:13:24.880]  i mean you know when when somebody comes in at it don't look like you and and
[3:13:24.880 --> 3:13:30.080]  remember with this hip hop culture black men have been criminalized
[3:13:30.080 --> 3:13:33.120]  i mean when you see a black guy first thing you do is is hit the lock on your
[3:13:33.120 --> 3:13:36.320]  door you know oh this is stuff black folks say they do that
[3:13:36.320 --> 3:13:40.160]  absolutely because this has been planted in everybody's mind that that were
[3:13:40.160 --> 3:13:44.400]  criminals i mean look at all our heroes jz
[3:13:44.400 --> 3:13:48.240]  rick ross 50 cent
[3:13:48.240 --> 3:13:52.000]  all of these guys are talking about the crime criminal culture
[3:13:52.000 --> 3:13:55.520]  and dr dray you brought this you got a meeting with him you said you got cut off
[3:13:55.520 --> 3:13:58.320]  what happened well i started to talk to him about what was
[3:13:58.320 --> 3:14:01.680]  happening in compton and that we need to do some things in compton that would
[3:14:01.680 --> 3:14:04.960]  uplift our community you know that there's no job development centers in
[3:14:04.960 --> 3:14:08.160]  compton uh that nobody is is is helping these
[3:14:08.160 --> 3:14:11.360]  people know that you can make it other ways like
[3:14:11.360 --> 3:14:16.160]  these kids believe that dr dray was a thug dr dray is not a thug
[3:14:16.160 --> 3:14:19.200]  he wasn't around when when when i was coming up
[3:14:19.200 --> 3:14:23.760]  so our kids don't understand that they don't understand that that that that he
[3:14:23.760 --> 3:14:26.800]  used turntables to get rich they think that he sold drugs
[3:14:26.800 --> 3:14:30.000]  and then took that money and turned it into music and that's not what happened
[3:14:30.000 --> 3:14:33.200]  what did he say how did he cut you off he told me he didn't know that this
[3:14:33.200 --> 3:14:36.160]  stuff was happening out there and i was like
[3:14:36.160 --> 3:14:39.600]  how could you not so he just denies that when he knows full well
[3:14:39.600 --> 3:14:43.280]  it's that persona that's selling the records absolutely and that he could use
[3:14:43.280 --> 3:14:47.120]  that now and go in and and tell him a good
[3:14:47.120 --> 3:14:50.000]  message and he doesn't want to do that because he wouldn't sound hard and
[3:14:50.000 --> 3:14:53.680]  cool and you know being all these dr pepper commercials or whatever
[3:14:53.680 --> 3:14:58.080]  if he wasn't up there going out hard now this and that i'm back to gray
[3:14:58.080 --> 3:15:01.120]  absolutely absolutely and i think that hell chrysler wouldn't let him have the
[3:15:01.120 --> 3:15:06.240]  gray system in the 300s if he wasn't against it he wasn't hard
[3:15:06.240 --> 3:15:08.960]  let me tell you what's hard is fighting the new world order what's hard is
[3:15:08.960 --> 3:15:12.080]  getting people not to abort their babies what's hard is telling the truth and
[3:15:12.080 --> 3:15:15.600]  going up against the system not acting like you're a thug
[3:15:15.600 --> 3:15:18.000]  makes me sick and going along with the system
[3:15:18.000 --> 3:15:22.080]  yeah a real thug wouldn't go with the system
[3:15:22.080 --> 3:15:26.480]  makes me want to throw up i tell you right now uh mic great story thanks for
[3:15:26.480 --> 3:15:29.520]  sharing it yeah i just hate drugs well listen
[3:15:29.520 --> 3:15:32.480]  rob do was in a store one of i think was rob do told me about i saw the report
[3:15:32.480 --> 3:15:35.920]  they did and they have a who's the meth dealer
[3:15:35.920 --> 3:15:39.440]  breaking bad number one show for a while i never really watched it
[3:15:39.440 --> 3:15:42.400]  and they had a meth he's a meth dealer toy for kids
[3:15:42.400 --> 3:15:46.560]  and he has meth in his suitcase so the kids go and buy it
[3:15:46.560 --> 3:15:50.240]  and then you know they go out imagine they're a meth dealer
[3:15:50.240 --> 3:15:53.120]  wow i heard about the show but i wouldn't watch it
[3:15:53.120 --> 3:15:56.400]  um i'm like i wouldn't either because i knew
[3:15:56.400 --> 3:15:59.760]  and of course it made meth get even more popular absolutely
[3:15:59.760 --> 3:16:03.600]  you know they show a guy that breaks bad and and and everybody accepts it and
[3:16:03.600 --> 3:16:07.760]  and he gets i think that show got so many awards that it was crazy
[3:16:07.760 --> 3:16:11.200]  but that's the same thing that happened with me with superfly
[3:16:11.200 --> 3:16:15.680]  i see a guy that dead dead just like me who's down on his luck and things are
[3:16:15.680 --> 3:16:19.840]  not going well for him and and cocaine makes everything right for him
[3:16:19.840 --> 3:16:23.440]  unbelievable that lunch here in just a minute we're almost over
[3:16:23.440 --> 3:16:26.240]  to uh mark and texas got to move quick former cop
[3:16:26.240 --> 3:16:30.800]  uh go ahead i'm sorry to be honest speaking to both of you guys
[3:16:30.800 --> 3:16:36.800]  um i just think i was a special officer at dbj and i'll tell you that
[3:16:36.800 --> 3:16:41.440]  i signed it was among a lot of the uh inmates who was more on it at the
[3:16:41.440 --> 3:16:46.160]  offices either officers in the street or officers in the prison
[3:16:46.160 --> 3:16:49.920]  i uh you know and um i understand that i was part of the
[3:16:49.920 --> 3:16:53.600]  cia goes by jfk said he wanted to break the cia
[3:16:53.600 --> 3:16:57.600]  he's with thousand pieces and it's probably with passing his life too
[3:16:57.600 --> 3:17:01.040]  i saw that movie he's uh uh killed a messenger
[3:17:01.040 --> 3:17:04.400]  and it almost made me cry man i i i have to keep from
[3:17:04.400 --> 3:17:08.160]  crying going that's going on it's like i guess if the government we say i
[3:17:08.160 --> 3:17:11.360]  fact is he's actually tearing me think that
[3:17:11.360 --> 3:17:14.800]  and i heard about this morning the second of the eighties i didn't want to
[3:17:14.800 --> 3:17:17.520]  believe it i didn't believe it i didn't think
[3:17:17.520 --> 3:17:21.120]  something this people could be going on but unfortunately it is
[3:17:21.120 --> 3:17:25.600]  and it's up to us get together and has nothing to do with black life
[3:17:25.600 --> 3:17:31.280]  exactly fan rounds it's just that we it's us versus jen the good people
[3:17:31.280 --> 3:17:35.600]  against a small percentage of people that is hijacked our government we got
[3:17:35.600 --> 3:17:39.280]  to explain to young people when the kids tell you use drugs and it's cool
[3:17:39.280 --> 3:17:42.880]  you got to understand it's all a trap to legalize slavery
[3:17:42.880 --> 3:17:46.240]  and put you in a hole don't use illegal drugs
[3:17:46.240 --> 3:17:50.480]  ever for no reason winning is staying out of the system
[3:17:50.480 --> 3:17:53.760]  and the government is so criminal now hey if you don't do it make your own
[3:17:53.760 --> 3:17:57.200]  decision you don't want to pay taxes you want to be successful you want to do
[3:17:57.200 --> 3:18:00.640]  stuff you know whatever that's your issue is time to withdraw our support
[3:18:00.640 --> 3:18:04.000]  from the system i'm not advising folks to be you know do that
[3:18:04.000 --> 3:18:08.400]  just do what you got to do but there are ways to really be
[3:18:08.400 --> 3:18:12.720]  counter to this evil culture where you can actually be a rebel
[3:18:12.720 --> 3:18:16.480]  don't be the fake rebel they tell you to be is what i'm getting at right
[3:18:16.480 --> 3:18:19.840]  the false rebel when you think you're a rebel but you really plan right into
[3:18:19.840 --> 3:18:21.920]  the system exactly the system's telling you to be
[3:18:21.920 --> 3:18:26.080]  this false rebel wear a hip-hop uniform so the cops have been trained to go
[3:18:26.080 --> 3:18:28.960]  after you yeah you're almost turning yourself in
[3:18:28.960 --> 3:18:33.600]  you know when when i look back at it i almost turn myself into a slave
[3:18:33.600 --> 3:18:37.600]  that's what i did turn myself into free at last free at last thank god almighty
