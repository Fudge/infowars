[02:16.800 --> 02:21.920]  through their savings lining up just to get their hands on the latest technology completely
[02:21.920 --> 02:26.720]  oblivious to the fact that they are actually paying to have their private conversations
[02:26.720 --> 02:32.520]  recorded and shared with third parties take the new Samsung smart TV the amount of data
[02:32.520 --> 02:40.600]  that this thing collects is staggering just say what you want it logs where when how
[02:40.600 --> 02:47.640]  and for how long you use the TV it sets tracking cookies and beacons designed to detect when
[02:47.640 --> 02:54.480]  you have viewed particular content or a particular email message it records the apps you use
[02:54.480 --> 02:59.520]  the websites you visit and how you interact with content and it of course has a built

[03:42.720 --> 03:48.240]  to providing customized content and convenience but it's also incredibly personal constitutionally
[03:48.240 --> 03:54.960]  protected information that should not be for sale to advertisers and should require a warrant

[04:00.240 --> 04:05.880]  do it yourself in two years time the stuff that this Samsung TV can do will be old news
[04:05.880 --> 04:11.360]  what's wrong let's say you're having a fight with your spouse in front of your television
[04:11.360 --> 04:16.360]  well that camera and microphone that's been surreptitiously recording all of your private
[04:16.360 --> 04:22.280]  conversations and scanning your body language can now send that information to third party
[04:22.280 --> 04:29.040]  advertisers so that they can air a perfectly timed commercial suggesting some SSRIs for
[04:29.040 --> 04:34.360]  them it's all about targeted advertising but for the surveillance apparatus it's about
[04:34.360 --> 04:41.920]  complete information control it's primary intention is to transmit data it receives data from smart

[10:05.160 --> 10:14.560]  show because there is a rule for your mind welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome to this
[10:14.560 --> 10:22.400]  Tuesday the third day of February 2015 global transmission investigative journalist Greg
[10:22.400 --> 10:27.920]  Pallist of the London Guardian and the BBC will be joining us former top federal fraud
[10:27.920 --> 10:34.440]  investigator to discuss how elites destabilize countries including trying to create civil
[10:34.440 --> 10:39.920]  unrest like you've seen them trying to do here in the United States Ukraine Greece and
[10:39.920 --> 10:45.000]  other areas we have a huge broadcast lined up today but the first thing I'm going to
[10:45.000 --> 10:56.320]  do is go directly to the measles mumps rubella insert by Merck and co Inc this is the most
[10:56.320 --> 11:03.040]  popular used vaccine in the United States this is given to children every two years
[11:03.040 --> 11:10.440]  on average in the United States now this isn't the fact sheet or the bologna sheet or the
[11:10.440 --> 11:17.080]  Bravo Sierra paper that they'll hand you at the major pharmacies when you ask about them
[11:17.080 --> 11:21.640]  they'll say safe and effective they'll have news articles saying no side effects ladies
[11:21.640 --> 11:31.880]  and gentlemen the entire back and most the front is the side effects okay it would take
[11:31.880 --> 11:37.160]  me hours to go over all this but we're going to cover some of them including an entire
[11:37.160 --> 11:48.440]  column of death it says it gives you acute pancreatitis and then afterwards you get diabetes
[11:48.440 --> 11:54.320]  now I talked to medical doctors and I've talked to medical doctors at the major children's
[11:54.320 --> 11:59.640]  center here in Austin I'll just leave it at that and they said no definitely we're now
[11:59.640 --> 12:03.800]  noticing when we give kids their third round of shots at 18 months a lot of times they
[12:03.800 --> 12:11.760]  then crash go into a coma in a week and they've got diabetes and then they say it's type one
[12:11.760 --> 12:16.880]  they claim it's genetic when the kids all come down with it well it's not genetic you
[12:16.880 --> 12:24.120]  fried their pancreas it says it will eat your pancreas in this sheet do you understand how
[12:24.120 --> 12:28.840]  frustrating this is if the average person would just read this like they'd read fantasy football
[12:28.840 --> 12:34.480]  publications our problems will be over immediately I mean do you have any idea how angry I am
[12:34.480 --> 12:40.200]  right now I mean this is pointless okay you can go to info wars calm and we're going to
[12:40.200 --> 12:46.400]  have an article out this afternoon that links to Merck's own website so you can find this
[12:46.400 --> 13:02.200]  but anybody can get the Merck and co measles mumps rubella insert that comes with the bottle
[13:02.200 --> 13:06.800]  now again you don't ever go out and get a vaccine bottle yourself you go and they pull
[13:06.800 --> 13:13.720]  some out of it and inject you please demand this when you go to Walgreens or Costco or
[13:13.720 --> 13:21.000]  Walmart or CVS demand this they'll look at you like you're a two-headed jet pilot from
[13:21.000 --> 13:25.720]  Pluto because just like if you ask for the vaccine waiver at school they'll tell you
[13:25.720 --> 13:34.920]  there is no such thing Mr. Jones or Mrs. Johnson or Mrs. Ramirez or Mr. Chew and you say yeah
[13:34.920 --> 13:37.920]  it's in your drawer right there by law you're supposed to give it to me and they'll say
[13:37.920 --> 13:45.320]  no it's not and then you will be face to face with a massive criminal conspiracy now that
[13:45.320 --> 13:53.400]  said everybody's favorite little non-threatening cutie pie Megan Kelly Fox News puts out a
[13:53.400 --> 13:59.080]  lot of good info on fake global warming things like that but only enough to keep their audience
[13:59.080 --> 14:03.400]  Rupert Murdoch has admitted that in press releases video press releases we've played
[14:03.400 --> 14:07.360]  here with his top executives going yes Fox News does a little bit of that but we balance
[14:07.360 --> 14:11.920]  it out with our other entertainment lines with a unified message that global warming
[14:11.920 --> 14:15.600]  is real and carbon taxes are needed and then they play in the video promo we played many
[14:15.600 --> 14:21.760]  times dozens and dozens of clips from cartoons and movies and TV shows put out by news core
[14:21.760 --> 14:30.080]  promoting global government carbon taxes I've got a clip of Megan Kelly saying having kids
[14:30.080 --> 14:35.480]  is what's making the earth sick we need to restrict having kids that's Megan Kelly again
[14:35.480 --> 14:41.280]  reading off a teleprompter that's in my film in game blueprint for global enslavement when
[14:41.280 --> 14:47.320]  she was just a news reader at Fox News people having kids making the planet worse Megan
[14:47.320 --> 14:59.280]  it's sick Megan Kelly got a clip of that in in game 2007 she has come out and said that
[14:59.280 --> 15:03.680]  everybody needs to vaccinate their kids and an Obama is saying it and they're they've
[15:03.680 --> 15:08.400]  got Terry Bradshaw on the news saying it they've got all the usual suspects out there
[15:08.400 --> 15:14.360]  who I'll bet you my bottom dollar I don't know doctors that take vaccines I don't know
[15:14.360 --> 15:19.240]  most nurses that take vaccines and I don't know rich people that take them they laugh
[15:19.240 --> 15:28.160]  at you when you say do you take them in fact doctor Oz famously has a conscience and doctor
[15:28.160 --> 15:33.800]  Oz came out and he said listen get your kids vaccinated but by the way I don't vaccinate
[15:33.800 --> 15:43.160]  mine my wife won't let me show it's like when I had that state attorney on the attorney
[15:43.160 --> 15:47.880]  general's office from Maryland it's got to be like 10 years ago and they were announcing
[15:47.880 --> 15:51.240]  on the news it's the law it's the law you got to take vaccines it was a big national
[15:51.240 --> 15:55.200]  news story a big hoax that went on for like a week and it showed thousands of mainly
[15:55.200 --> 15:59.200]  black people line up at the courthouse crying saying I don't want to take them they made
[15:59.200 --> 16:03.120]  my brother sick stuff like that I would get some of the families on they had SWAT teams
[16:03.120 --> 16:09.600]  and dogs out there and I get the state attorney on the day after they did it he goes and I
[16:09.600 --> 16:12.480]  go you know there's a waiver it's not even the law but you got to give him a waiver
[16:12.480 --> 16:15.680]  and he goes you're you ought to be a lawyer Mr. Jones we had those waivers at the judge's
[16:15.680 --> 16:19.520]  desk and if somebody asked for him we'd give it to him but I said that nobody knew and
[16:19.520 --> 16:24.360]  he said you're right he started laughing going man you're smart you ought to join the government
[16:24.360 --> 16:29.560]  like I was smart so I should join him and screwing people over and I said man I see
[16:29.560 --> 16:33.800]  what you're doing is criminal keeping this knowledge from people and I said let me ask
[16:33.800 --> 16:40.080]  you a question you vaccinate your children he said absolutely not and he was black and
[16:40.080 --> 16:46.960]  he was laughing about all these poor black people who might be poor but they're smarter
[16:46.960 --> 16:50.960]  than the average white yuppie they don't want to take the shots they're not stupid folks
[16:50.960 --> 16:54.480]  they've already heard about all the secret testing on black people they're like I don't
[16:54.480 --> 17:02.280]  I don't think so by the way all the studies fluoride has a double effect on Africans lowers
[17:02.280 --> 17:06.880]  the white persons IQ around 10 points to drink at two years black people you might as well
[17:06.880 --> 17:18.280]  give them a lobotomy and it's a blood brain barrier issue it's very very sad fluoride's
[17:18.280 --> 17:24.160]  a lot worse for boys and then it's black males oh my goodness might as well be a death sentence
[17:24.160 --> 17:28.680]  ladies and gentlemen why do you think so many boys get screwed up from the vaccines we aren't
[17:28.680 --> 17:36.120]  as strong as girls boys are more high performance but we can't take insults like women can gunshot
[17:36.120 --> 17:42.200]  wounds you name it women are tougher when it comes to surviving and our men are under
[17:42.200 --> 17:47.600]  massive attack ladies and gentlemen but let me just get to the actual murk document here
[17:47.600 --> 17:52.600]  when we come back from break but first let's play Obama saying just get your vaccine it's
[17:52.600 --> 17:58.640]  been proven to be safe when they know there's a multi-billion dollar secret court the vaccine
[17:58.640 --> 18:03.280]  damage fund that covers all this up and gags people so they can't warn others let's go
[18:03.280 --> 18:09.000]  ahead and go to that clip of Obama do you feel there should be a requirement that parents
[18:09.000 --> 18:14.680]  get their kids vaccinated measles is preventable I understand that their families that in some
[18:14.680 --> 18:21.960]  cases are concerned about the effect of vaccinations the science is you know pretty indisputable
[18:21.960 --> 18:28.600]  we've looked at this again and again there is every reason to get vaccinated there aren't
[18:28.600 --> 18:33.120]  reasons to not parents you should get your kids vaccinated you should get your kids vaccinated
[18:33.120 --> 18:38.120]  it's good for them but we should be able to get back to the point where measles effectively
[18:38.120 --> 18:44.400]  is not existing okay when we come back I'm going to show you not once not twice three
[18:44.400 --> 18:50.840]  times in the murk insert for the mmr shot measles shot mumps and rubella where it says
[18:50.840 --> 18:58.680]  it will give you measles including an acute type that will kill you and then I've got
[18:58.680 --> 19:02.160]  articles right here with mainstream links admitting that the big measles outbreak in
[19:02.160 --> 19:08.440]  california two years ago was a vaccinated people they're spreading measles I'm gonna
[19:08.440 --> 19:15.160]  say it again they're spreading measles and if you're not a TV viewer if you're a radio

[28:35.480 --> 28:40.600]  goes and investigates finds out and just admits in a footnote by the way these were vaccinated
[28:40.600 --> 28:46.280]  people it's believed that they got measles from it just like it's come out that the disney workers
[28:46.280 --> 28:54.120]  were vaccinated and then now they're spreading measles just like somebody gets the flu shot
[28:54.120 --> 28:57.880]  in your family and suddenly everybody gets really bad flu let's go out to break with
[28:57.880 --> 29:01.800]  megan kelly here's megan kelly saying get your shots what i said was that there has to be a
[29:01.800 --> 29:07.400]  balance and it depends on what the vaccine is what the disease type is and all the rest and so
[29:07.400 --> 29:10.680]  i didn't say i'm leaving people the option what i'm saying is that you have to have that balance
[29:11.400 --> 29:13.400]  in considering parental concerns
[29:17.400 --> 29:24.840]  that's chris christie we've got another clip when we come back with megan kelly where she's saying

[33:20.200 --> 33:27.080]  minute clip up on info wars dot com fox host on mandatory vaccines quote some things require
[33:27.080 --> 33:33.240]  big brother uh paul and christie slam for saying parents should have choice well yeah we're gonna
[33:33.240 --> 33:39.480]  set a precedent where a government caught in thousands of secret lethal tests will be able
[33:39.480 --> 33:46.680]  to force whatever they want to our bodies when they've given the vaccine makers total liability
[33:46.680 --> 33:56.680]  protection in a secret federal court set up in the 1970s and they play this game of saying that
[33:56.680 --> 34:03.160]  there's no danger there's no problem they do the same thing saying obama care doesn't have
[34:03.160 --> 34:09.720]  hidden taxes in it and now they're starting or there's no death panels when they're in the bill
[34:09.720 --> 34:16.200]  and now they're operating or there's no global government forming or there's no spy tech in
[34:16.200 --> 34:26.280]  your phone they just play this game of lying to you i just showed you i just showed you from the
[34:26.280 --> 34:31.960]  merc insert where it can give you diabetes it can give you pancreatitis it can give you all
[34:31.960 --> 34:40.600]  sorts of serious problems it can give you measles mumps and rubella this is a triple jab it has
[34:40.600 --> 34:52.360]  three different things in it it goes on to say it indicates in research significant central nervous
[34:52.360 --> 35:00.040]  system reactions such as encephalitis and it just goes on occurring within 30 days after
[35:00.040 --> 35:05.880]  vaccinations and it lists neurological problems in the brain i mean it's right here but when
[35:05.880 --> 35:14.360]  your child has that convulsion pray they have that brain damaging convulsion at the hospital
[35:14.360 --> 35:18.680]  or at the clinic which most of them don't they usually have them a few hours after they're out
[35:18.680 --> 35:24.600]  playing the yard they drop dead sometimes or they have the convulsion blood runs out their
[35:24.600 --> 35:30.840]  nose you call the ambulance cops pull up they see a child with their eyes bugging out with the
[35:32.360 --> 35:37.480]  blood on the brain the paramedics say that they've got blood on the brain and they say
[35:37.480 --> 35:43.320]  mr jones or mrs johnson gonna need to go ahead and take you in for questioning they put handcuffs on
[35:43.320 --> 35:51.320]  you because no one's gonna say the medical dictatorship did anything wrong doesn't matter
[35:51.320 --> 35:59.000]  it's right here now that said it's so well known by the police now because they work
[35:59.000 --> 36:03.640]  compartmentalized that it the shaken baby and all of this is really vaccines that they now ask
[36:03.640 --> 36:10.280]  was your child just vaccinated and then no one apologizes that your kid's brain damaged or dead
[36:10.280 --> 36:17.400]  they at least don't indict you they at least don't indict you so when you talk about tyranny
[36:18.120 --> 36:21.880]  that's a horrible tyranny carried out by the government but it's done by the hospitals
[36:21.880 --> 36:27.000]  and by the power structure not by the police but when the police take part in it they become
[36:27.000 --> 36:32.440]  accomplices to the crime and they don't want brain damaged children so instead of just calling
[36:32.440 --> 36:36.440]  them criminals and calling them murderers let's just educate them and i found that they then
[36:36.440 --> 36:42.280]  understand the truth again i want to win this war against the new world order not dying a civil war
[36:42.280 --> 36:47.960]  i want to fix things not just hate everybody the average doctor knows that vaccines can do this
[36:47.960 --> 36:52.760]  but they'll say well we know there's problems but it outweighs the problems the benefits that
[36:52.760 --> 36:59.880]  that's the new lie when the numbers don't even show that hygiene by the 20s and 30s and indoor
[36:59.880 --> 37:05.640]  plumbing is when all these diseases plummeted and then vaccines came in and then if you look at most
[37:05.640 --> 37:13.480]  the graphs the decline slowed and actually went up in some regions of the u.s australian other areas
[37:14.840 --> 37:18.120]  never went back up to pre industrialization levels
[37:21.400 --> 37:28.040]  but it bounced back up some i mean these are facts there's an excellent article from naturalnews.com
[37:28.040 --> 37:38.200]  the 21 points to ask about vaccines i say that because the printer cut off the actual headline
[37:40.280 --> 37:44.200]  and it's an excellent article we'll just put it on screen i'll give you the actual headline
[37:45.240 --> 37:55.480]  what should you or should your child avoid getting verivax and this is this is a whole big
[37:55.480 --> 38:02.920]  thick article 25 pages of the drug inserts from the vaccines and it says do not take aspirin
[38:02.920 --> 38:07.560]  containing products for six weeks after getting it it is rare but possible that once you have
[38:07.560 --> 38:13.400]  the vaccine you could spread the chickenpox virus to others and then it goes on whenever possible
[38:13.400 --> 38:18.280]  try to avoid contact with certain groups of people for up to six weeks after receiving the vaccine
[38:18.280 --> 38:25.240]  so they give the disney workers mmr chickenpox shots you name it they send them in and then
[38:25.240 --> 38:30.920]  they don't tell you you can spread it uh here is a popular influenza virus vaccine
[38:32.760 --> 38:33.560]  flu laval
[38:36.760 --> 38:42.440]  and it goes on to say that there have been no controlled trials adequately demonstrating
[38:42.440 --> 38:48.680]  a decrease in influenza disease after vaccination and then it goes on to say
[38:48.680 --> 38:56.360]  that mothers that take Gardasil shouldn't breastfeed their babies because they can give
[38:56.360 --> 39:02.440]  them respiratory illness and then it just basically goes on to admit that it can cause
[39:02.440 --> 39:10.920]  all sorts of other problems it's just 25 pages of vaccines basically giving you exactly what
[39:10.920 --> 39:16.840]  they claim that they're fighting i'm gonna do a whole special report on the nightly news tonight
[39:16.840 --> 39:21.480]  condensing all of this down but let's go ahead and go to the uh meg and kelly clip where she's
[39:21.480 --> 39:29.240]  attacking rand paul ron paul by extension and chris christie uh because they're saying yeah
[39:29.240 --> 39:34.040]  it's not a law you got to take vaccines they're not joining the bandwagon lying
[39:35.880 --> 39:44.520]  and saying that it's the law it's a big litmus test for me rick perry famously eight nine years
[39:44.520 --> 39:51.720]  ago said it's the law to take merc's Gardasil and tens of thousands of women and and men took their
[39:51.720 --> 39:57.320]  daughters in their 11 and 12 year olds to get it it doesn't protect you from hpv the insert says it
[39:57.960 --> 40:02.680]  it can end up giving you hpv it can cause autoimmune disorders and it kills a lot of people
[40:03.240 --> 40:09.480]  it's banned in australia it's banned in um japan it's banned in india
[40:09.480 --> 40:17.320]  and rick perry did reverse himself and called hpv vaccine mandate a mistake well it was a lie
[40:17.320 --> 40:25.320]  governor but they run this hoax it's the law no there is no law and they all engage in this big
[40:25.320 --> 40:30.760]  conspiracy because they think it's the right thing to do and then once it starts killing people they
[40:30.760 --> 40:35.800]  could never admit oh my gosh this is a eugenics program this is a mass public testing program
[40:35.800 --> 40:40.040]  no no no there's no admissions of that it's just make fun of anybody that talks about it
[40:40.040 --> 40:45.000]  and say that we're going to make everybody sick that's all over the news now you're going to
[40:45.000 --> 40:51.000]  make me sick you take a vaccine in fact i hardly ever get confronted by people that don't like me
[40:51.000 --> 40:56.920]  10 15 years ago it happened routinely the tides turn people know that we're really covering real
[40:56.920 --> 41:00.840]  issues and that we were trailblazers but let me tell you the one group now that gets in my face
[41:00.840 --> 41:05.240]  before it be somebody rolling down their window or on their motorcycle going oh
[41:05.240 --> 41:11.640]  our black helicopter is going to get me that doesn't happen people will walk up to me in
[41:11.640 --> 41:17.400]  restaurants or at the shopping mall or the grocery store and they'll say you mr jones
[41:17.400 --> 41:23.720]  are endangering the public not getting vaccines and you should be put in jail and i'll say say
[41:23.720 --> 41:27.400]  that on camera i'll pull my phone out and they'll run off i mean sometimes they get
[41:27.400 --> 41:32.600]  hopping mad and are pumped up in the grocery store and i'll see somebody looking at me when
[41:32.600 --> 41:37.800]  i'm in the you know veggie aisle and um excuse me and they're like yeah don't think we don't
[41:37.800 --> 41:41.800]  know what you're doing in the medical crisis tell people not to get shots you're gonna kill a lot
[41:41.800 --> 41:47.240]  of people you're gonna infect people like me and i'm just like but you take the shot what it
[41:47.240 --> 41:53.720]  thoughts you're protected bozo and when i don't back down to them then they usually just get mad
[41:53.720 --> 41:59.800]  and run off but they're out there in fact i bet money i can say the phones are only open in fact
[41:59.800 --> 42:05.400]  i wasn't gonna take calls of sour but they're only open if you disagree and you think that
[42:06.120 --> 42:10.200]  i should be arrested like a drunk driver endangering the public or that we should be forced
[42:10.200 --> 42:14.200]  forcibly inoculated david night was sitting in friday and somebody called in saying that
[42:14.200 --> 42:25.240]  i'd love to hear from you 800-259-9231 800-2599-231 and i'm not debating the science of vaccines
[42:25.240 --> 42:30.600]  i'm not debating that you can get learned immunity artificially and that for 500 years they would take
[42:30.600 --> 42:36.920]  the push of someone that already had smallpox and that you would want to get it while you were
[42:36.920 --> 42:41.240]  healthy instead of when you were sick so it wouldn't kill you and you would go and infect yourself
[42:41.240 --> 42:47.720]  or infect your children knowing it could still kill them but statistically it was safer to do it
[42:47.720 --> 42:52.600]  and to get sick when you weren't lowered immune system you usually get stuff like this when
[42:52.600 --> 42:57.800]  you're already sick already compromised so you want to get in the fight when you're awake healthy
[42:57.800 --> 43:03.960]  and know it's coming down not when you're asleep is the analogy i get it but you add the west
[43:03.960 --> 43:09.080]  secret testing not just in nazi germany but the us made the nazis look tame when it came to
[43:09.080 --> 43:14.440]  secret testing or britain or all these other countries caught doing lethal testing i mean do
[43:14.440 --> 43:20.200]  i have to mention tiskegee and the rest of it again and that's the tip of the iceberg again i
[43:20.200 --> 43:25.160]  mentioned tiskegee because everybody knows about tiskegee injecting black people for 47 years
[43:25.160 --> 43:30.520]  with syphilis and then having them spread it through the black community nationwide and now
[43:30.520 --> 43:37.240]  with computer models they've traced most of the major syphilis outbreaks from the 30s right through
[43:37.240 --> 43:45.560]  to the 70s with those programs our governments our government spread hiv in the late 70s in
[43:45.560 --> 43:52.040]  hepatitis shots in new york that's been partially declassified why'd they use gay men because they
[43:52.040 --> 43:57.880]  were seen as a good vector having unprotected sex with hundreds of partners a year of vector
[44:00.680 --> 44:04.440]  then they make a whole cause celeb out of the fact that you have hiv like to have a
[44:04.440 --> 44:09.400]  cause celeb now about having breast cancer it becomes this big pageant about oh they have
[44:09.400 --> 44:14.760]  breast cancer they have hiv go give them money find a cure not find out why they got it
[44:17.400 --> 44:20.920]  everyone's getting neurological disorders now join a help group it's fun
[44:22.360 --> 44:28.200]  so they put into this whole process of oh you know we give the wounded warriors with the head
[44:28.200 --> 44:32.920]  injuries help we don't not send them these illegal wars we just give them the care they need when
[44:32.920 --> 44:37.640]  they get back which they actually don't give them they put them on secret death panels but that's
[44:37.640 --> 44:45.640]  okay see they all put it into a sick process so let's go to meg and kelly and and uh oh riley
[44:45.640 --> 44:52.040]  criticizing rand paul criticizing um chris christie and i gotta say it's the only enduring
[44:52.040 --> 44:57.960]  thing about chris christie is that he has always said vaccines are not the law and you should you
[44:57.960 --> 45:03.160]  should read the insert and i haven't had a chance to talk to chris christie i can't stand him anti gun
[45:03.160 --> 45:11.560]  open borders guy but i'll bet you a bottom dollar he's got family hurt by vaccines my mother almost
[45:11.560 --> 45:17.720]  got killed by flu shot my uncle almost died from a tetanus shot see there's growing numbers of people
[45:17.720 --> 45:25.400]  that don't want them because they've been through it everybody i run into that that's got an autistic
[45:25.400 --> 45:31.000]  son i say hey when did this happen at 18 months so we got him his third round of shots he had a

[47:10.920 --> 47:18.600]  to autism it says neurological disorders it says narcolepsy it says epilepsy it says it
[47:18.600 --> 47:24.840]  it says it it says it so go ahead and get your 18 month old daughter because it hits girls this

[47:36.840 --> 47:44.040]  they're gonna have type 1 diabetes they're gonna be dying grounding and sugar and then they're
[47:44.040 --> 47:49.400]  going to tell you oh it's genetic covering their butts because that's the whole cover story but it's
[47:49.400 --> 47:56.680]  okay because the cute little the cute little palm iranian of the airwaves megan kelly says just we
[47:56.680 --> 48:02.760]  need big brother to surveil people we need to just come on joining obama and the chorus just take
[48:02.760 --> 48:10.680]  your shots just take your shots just do it let's go to that clip this is going to be the next big
[48:10.680 --> 48:15.320]  question for all these presidential candidates how they feel about mandatory vaccines right because
[48:15.320 --> 48:19.640]  of the outbreak that we've seen of measles in this country a disease that we have a vaccine for
[48:19.640 --> 48:23.160]  i mean you will not get the measles if you get the vaccine it's like 13 percent of kids don't get
[48:23.160 --> 48:28.200]  vaccinated because their parents don't believe in it or whatever if they lose this war they lose
[48:28.200 --> 48:33.160]  everything now rob did the report last week i'm going to do an even more expanded one tonight
[48:33.160 --> 48:37.080]  we're going to show you the articles the clubs where they admit that vaccines are causing the
[48:37.080 --> 48:41.800]  measles but i just showed you the insert she said if you get the shot you're protected obama said
[48:41.800 --> 48:49.640]  the same line they say take the flu shot you're protected the flu shots never worked not one time
[48:49.640 --> 48:57.080]  that's a fact but they sit up there with their con game going you can keep your doctor
[48:59.160 --> 49:02.760]  obama cared for the price of a phone bill raising the debt limit doesn't raise the debt limit
[49:03.720 --> 49:07.480]  there's no side effects there's no problems you take this you won't get the measles
[49:07.480 --> 49:12.840]  and she's lying and going who are these people that are against forced vaccines they're acting like
[49:12.840 --> 49:19.560]  it's the law see the con game they bill o'reilly and meghan kelly are preying on you and meghan
[49:19.560 --> 49:27.000]  i'm going to tell you something god's going to hurt you bad not me i'm not putting a curse out
[49:27.000 --> 49:31.160]  on you i'm telling you this stuff comes back on you bill o'reilly and meghan kelly you guys are
[49:31.160 --> 49:35.560]  smart but you've been sent the literature i know for a fact people that know both of you
[49:36.120 --> 49:41.960]  you know all of this bill o'reilly was anti-vaccine 25 years ago and hard to copy he's really smart
[49:42.680 --> 49:47.720]  was it extra you guys know what you're doing and the kids are on you as far as i'm concerned you're
[49:47.720 --> 49:53.000]  both aiding in a betting murderers and i'm gonna tell you it's gonna come back on you
[49:53.000 --> 49:56.040]  it's gonna come back on you're gonna pay and your family's gonna pay god's gonna hurt you bad
[49:58.280 --> 50:02.360]  god you better you better get some god-fearing right now you better repent right now
[50:02.360 --> 50:06.600]  because you're aborting kids and torturing them right now with this stuff let's let's let's let's
[50:06.600 --> 50:11.320]  hear this witch one more time this is going to be the the next big question for all these
[50:11.320 --> 50:16.040]  presidential candidates how they feel about mandatory vaccines right because of the outbreak
[50:16.040 --> 50:20.040]  that we've seen of measles in this country a disease that we have a vaccine for i mean you
[50:20.040 --> 50:23.800]  will not get the measles if you get the vaccine it's like 13 percent of kids don't get vaccinated
[50:23.800 --> 50:28.200]  because their parents don't believe in it or whatever but in defense of those who have not
[50:28.200 --> 50:34.600]  vaccinated their children they were given bad information years ago by a uk study that came
[50:34.600 --> 50:41.160]  out in 1988 but now there's good information so but even in defense of christy and president obama
[50:41.160 --> 50:47.800]  both of whom came out and made somewhat anti or pro vaccine statements today they had made sort of
[50:47.800 --> 50:52.760]  more moderated statements five years ago no no but let me say this five years ago the science wasn't
[50:52.760 --> 50:57.800]  even folks they run that hoax about dr. wakefield it's it's it's been proven there are other studies
[50:57.800 --> 51:04.520]  that show it too it's just a lot of people's lives and bodies are out of balance alcovision plasma ph

[54:23.560 --> 54:28.760]  confirmed by three others that the government did previous to his he never recanted he was never
[54:28.760 --> 54:35.160]  proven in fraud they just said oh all the vaccine stuff's a fraud because dr wakefield's been proven
[54:35.160 --> 54:42.280]  to be a fraud wakefield is suing that journal and that reporter that wrote that piece you don't
[54:42.280 --> 54:50.760]  ever hear about that do you hear about the two merc scientists who were in the fda who went public
[54:50.760 --> 54:57.400]  fda whistleblowers exposed vaccines and said that they faked the trials and covered up the damage
[54:58.520 --> 55:04.040]  that came out last year and barely made it in mainstream news merc has some explaining to do
[55:04.040 --> 55:12.200]  over its m mr vaccine claims hovington post and then it's got the whistleblowers from the cdc
[55:12.200 --> 55:18.520]  from the fda and from merc merc's former doctor predicts that garthus will become the greatest

[56:48.040 --> 56:52.840]  medical tyrants these dr mingolas are are doing this and the average doctor's compartmentalized
[56:52.840 --> 56:58.520]  and won't admit the facts and lives in la la land and then doubles down and tells the news
[56:58.520 --> 57:02.840]  and tells the media and tells the public oh it's safe and effective the other might be a few side
[57:02.840 --> 57:07.960]  effects if you really push them but you know the the benefits outweigh the cost
[57:07.960 --> 57:16.680]  no they don't because this is a social engineering program by design like the fluoride the gmo

[01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:32.440]  says 9-11 truth responsible for seahawks superbowl loss and yes peak carol is a 9-11 truth through
[01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:37.160]  he says he likes to be able to see wide spectrum information that doesn't mean bush blow up the
[01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:42.280]  towers it means that they bear minimum allowed it to happen in her funding al-qaeda worldwide
[01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:46.440]  which now come out there was definitely a stand down six of the ten commissioners say that
[01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:52.840]  we're going to be breaking that down and going to greg palast as well but first here's david
[01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:59.080]  nice report from the measles outbreak in 2011 that they admit was caused by the vaccine just like
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:04.280]  this new outbreak they admit was caused by it and the insert says he can give people the measles
[01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:08.760]  so we're going to blow this cover up wide open with this david night report
[01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:16.760]  if you've got a french fry that was cooked in some pretty disgusting oils and has silly putty and
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:22.920]  other preservatives types of things added to it it's no longer just a potato and what we can learn
[01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:29.400]  from this is that vaccines that have adjuvants like aluminum that have preservatives like formaldehyde
[01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:35.480]  and mercury are no longer just vaccines that becomes an important part of the story and yet
[01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:43.080]  we see this continuing push to try to make vaccines mandatory in a usa today article a
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:49.880]  contributor alex barazov says your right to be sick ends where my right to be healthy begins in
[01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:55.720]  other words he has total contempt for any consent of what they might do to you he compares unvaccinated
[01:01:55.720 --> 01:02:01.240]  persons to drunk drivers who quote pose an imminent danger to others unquote and he says
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:07.160]  jail time for parents who turn quote their children into little walking time bombs unquote
[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:12.040]  is the only way to send a sufficiently strong message about the quote deadly consequences
[01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:17.240]  of failing to vaccinate children and this is what the director of the cdc said he said what
[01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:23.080]  you do for your own kids doesn't just affect your family it affects other families as well
[01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:29.240]  the more kids who are not vaccinated the more they put their neighbors kids at risk as well
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:36.200]  i'm sorry i thought that the vaccine kept them from getting the disease think about that admission
[01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:42.120]  for a second the cdc is saying that the kids who have had vaccines are at risk for getting the
[01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:48.520]  disease they're admitting that it's not effective it's worth noting that in the 2011 measles outbreak
[01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:56.120]  in new york where 88 people contracted measles the ground zero patient was fully vaccinated a 20
[01:02:56.120 --> 01:03:03.800]  you 22 year old woman an analysis of cdc data that you can find at vaxtruth.org don papl notes
[01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:11.400]  that prior to the introduction of the measles vaccine in the 1960s only 0.015 percent of measles
[01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:16.520]  cases resulted in death and the percentage of people who die globally from measles today is
[01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:26.920]  still very low at 0.003 to 8 percent think about that that means that you are 99.997
[01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:36.200]  chance of not dying now that's a pretty low risk contrast that to ebola where you had a 70 to 90
[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:41.720]  percent chance that you're going to die if you get that disease a disease that they did not and
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:46.760]  still do not exactly know how it's transmitted because so many doctors and nurses are coming
[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:51.240]  down with it even though they are exercising all the precautions that are supposed to shut
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:57.640]  down its transmission so you've got one disease that you have a 99.997 percent chance you're not
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:03.560]  going to die and they're trying to push mandatory vaccines on people and on the other hand they step
[01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:07.960]  back and tell the public there's nothing to worry about with the disease that has a 90
[01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:14.120]  percent fatality rate roughly 80 percent of states across the nation have since 2002 implemented
[01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:19.560]  in varying degrees the quote model state emergency health powers act that was developed by a
[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:25.480]  collaboration of government entities like the cdc and the un world health organization this grants
[01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:31.800]  tremendous powers to states at the expense of personal privacy and individual freedom it allows
[01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:38.600]  forced involuntary quarantines and government mandated vaccinations during officially declared
[01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:45.240]  emergencies that's the problem we can't get information and they don't want our consent
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:52.280]  and that's the big issue it's fundamentally about civil liberties and now folks are waking
[01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:56.600]  up to the medical tyranny and discovering the plan so now they do want to make it mandatory

[01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:15.960]  network well greg palace of abc news the london guardian the bbc best-selling multi-time author
[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:22.440]  former top federal fraud investigator will be with us for about 50 minutes uh here today uh during
[01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:27.880]  this hour we're going to cover some other news items first but he's the guy that got the secret
[01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:35.480]  imf world bank documents back in 2002 a transcript of our interview and those documents ended up
[01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:39.160]  getting published in hundreds of newspapers around the world up until that time it was one of the
[01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:43.640]  biggest stories i ever helped break i mean he'd already broken it but it went viral on this show
[01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:52.040]  and i dedicated a chapter in my book to to the imf riot and how these big robber barons left
[01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:57.000]  right it doesn't matter try to destabilize countries and cause civil unrest that they control
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:02.040]  whether it's google involved in the air of spring or george soros in ukraine
[01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:07.240]  or ferguson they take real problems that are out there but try to exacerbate it we're going to
[01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:15.480]  explain how this destabilization works from the mind on the subject sure we can have confessions
[01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:21.640]  of an economic hitman perkins on he's a great guy but he was mid-level hitman and all this you know
[01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:26.360]  he gets sent in by the military by the big corporations to make the offers then they would
[01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:31.480]  come in with destabilization if they didn't take him palest has never been on the inside he's been
[01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:37.240]  fighting it the entire time and so he's going to be breaking that down because we're seeing this
[01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:42.440]  happen on a planetary scale it's kind of like saudi arabia lower oil prices to bankrupt us oil
[01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:48.120]  producers and the russians now that's my view we'll get palest expert view on that in a moment
[01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:54.040]  but first off there's a big push that we just covered in the last hour to make vaccines mandatory
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:58.360]  and to claim that people not being vaccinated are getting other people sick well if you've had the
[01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:04.120]  vaccine you should be protected right well the merc insert we showed last hour says that it can
[01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:09.880]  give you the measles and then they admit that these disney people were vaccinated and then they
[01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:13.960]  admit it's immigrants bringing in these new measles strains so it's both the things they
[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:20.120]  don't want to look at open borders and vaccines that are behind this so it's just just just classic
[01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:26.920]  absolutely classic i'll get palest take on that but but first this article is on info wars.com by
[01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:34.680]  mckill felon fox news 9 11 truther responsible for seahawks superbowl loss so it's not 9 11
[01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:39.960]  truther responsible for getting him to the superbowl it's it's it's just a pavlovian demonization
[01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:45.320]  that oh he questions the official story of 9 11 like six of the 10 commissioners do
[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:50.200]  senator graham has said that it was a cover-up and then that they stood down the 28 pages are now
[01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:55.720]  known i've had congressman jones on i've had army officers on who've seen the documents i'll just
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:11:04.040]  tell you that we've heard them and it says norad stood down and the fbi investigations were blocked
[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:11.240]  and the saudi arabia ran the operation and bush had that classified folks we've now interviewed
[01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:18.200]  two different congressmen and kernels and others that have seen it the 28 pages are known they're
[01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:23.880]  getting ready to try to release them with a bill it doesn't mean that like wiley coyote as i say
[01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:30.920]  bush had a plunger and he did it but dick chaney was involved according to transportation secretary
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:37.720]  panetta ordering a stand down in the bunker that day the plane's 50 miles out 25 miles out 10 miles
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:42.040]  out five does the order still stand yes the order still stands and who a month before took the shoot
[01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:48.840]  down power from norad and gave it to the vice president his name's dick chaney so that's a fact
[01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:53.000]  and it's not fun to go up against these people it's not fun to tell the truth about this but it's
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:12:00.040]  got to be done just like sigh hers two time hold a surprise winner he's a listener of the show we've
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:04.760]  sent emails back to each other over the years but he always cops out coming on came out and
[01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:10.200]  said the the bin laden raids a hundred percent fake after we reported it and he also came out and
[01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:14.920]  said that 9 11 is you know not what they say basically to a certain extent and he's come out
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:19.160]  and said that the navy seals were charged with blowing up a us ship the last year a bushes
[01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:23.160]  administration to blame it on the iranians in the straddle hermuz and they said no
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:30.520]  no false flags are done historically the main gulf of tonkin and get us into vietnam
[01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:37.560]  so the question it is not a bad thing okay and and fox news boils it down that alex jones says
[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:41.960]  the firefighters blew up the towers i never said that this is the games they play oh because he's
[01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:47.640]  a 9 11 truther he jinxed the game and made a bad play no he made a ballsy play that if he'd
[01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:54.520]  made that catch then they'd have called in the greatest coach in history no guts no glory so it's
[01:12:54.520 --> 01:13:02.760]  the guts that got him there and i don't get into either side quite frankly um it's all mind control
[01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:07.160]  to begin with it's all a distraction i'll get greg palis take on that as well but but here's fox
[01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:13.240]  news in a pavlovian way saying yeah he wanted to lose his job as if i lose his job for for taking
[01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:19.480]  the super bowl repeatedly and winning the super bowl as if pete carol is a loser now and he lost
[01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:23.240]  the game because you know i love druther because he wants to go to work for alex jones and then
[01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:30.680]  fall wars this is what greg gutless gutler whatever his name is greg gutless had to say
[01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:35.160]  sniping at us because they fear us because they know we'll tell the truth let's go to this clip
[01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:41.320]  okay when you see a play that was so just deliberately self-destructive the only thing
[01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:47.560]  you could conclude is that it was an inside job and after all the coach uh coach pete carol is a
[01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:52.680]  nine eleven truther he believes the government had something to do with it with what happened
[01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:57.640]  that ended up in the depths of what almost three thousand people so i believe that this is an inside
[01:13:57.640 --> 01:14:03.480]  job i i'm but now i have to wonder why did pete carol throw the game and it's in order to lose
[01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:10.440]  his job so he can go work for alex jones and by the way folks they absolutely hate the fact that
[01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:14.600]  we have 20 million views or listeners every week i mean it's now about 20 million i'm saying 18 million
[01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:20.040]  it's about 20 million on an average week you know how freaked out they are by us having 600
[01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:24.520]  thousand people download the podcast and growing how upset they are on one youtube channel we had
[01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:29.160]  a couple million views a day how upset they are that we're on over 170 affiliates some of them
[01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:34.840]  huge and big cities but everyone's precious that we've got billboards all over the country uh that
[01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:39.640]  they know full well that a bunch of movie producers want to put me in movies playing myself
[01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:43.480]  they can see the zeitgeist that info wars has been writing for about a decade
[01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:49.080]  and they know i'm fearless they know i'm real they know they're gonna have to kill me to shut me up
[01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:54.120]  they don't like the prospects of that so they want to kill my name and they just call me bill
[01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:59.400]  o'rally goes there's a lot of sexual predators using facebook to stalk women how do we stop this
[01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:08.360]  hate and they cut to an image of me yelling nothing to do with women so alex makes you lose
[01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:14.520]  a super bowl alex wants to rape the women alex is behind the boss in bombing msnbc they're out to
[01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:18.200]  get us folks because we're over the target now i'm gonna talk about myself all day but i wanted to
[01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:24.680]  get greg palace media analyst uh london guardian bbc the whole nine yards uh true investigative
[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:29.240]  journalist uh in the mickey spalane vein i've thrown a lot out there i want to get into robber
[01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:33.160]  barons i want to get into his new book i want to get into destabilization programs ukraine
[01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:39.640]  uh the middle east but but but but greg i mean isis i know we've argued about pure inside job
[01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:43.640]  versus you let it happen or whatever so so you're kind of on the other side of this but should i
[01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:48.520]  be demonized for pointing out our government created al-qaeda helped fund isis i mean that's
[01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:55.880]  mainstream news greg um what is your view on the evidence coming out of the 28 pages that
[01:15:55.880 --> 01:16:01.400]  there was a stand down that the saudi arabians were quarterbacking the operation well two things i
[01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:07.720]  i admit i haven't seen the 28 pages x once said to me alex and i'll take a look um obviously
[01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:13.800]  we have different views on 9 11 but you know i already gotten super hot water when i put at
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:19.160]  the top of the bbc nightly news worldwide that you know the bush family was connected to the
[01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:26.440]  bin laden's and the fbi was told to stand down on investigations you broke that family yeah and um
[01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:31.720]  michael more kind of repeated but got a bit wrong but the important thing was what we put on bbc was
[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:39.560]  that uh uh us agents several us agents told us point blank you don't touch the bin laden family
[01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:45.400]  it's a career killer we had a document that says from that was slipped to us by fbi agents that said
[01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:52.520]  you know eyes only so you know it was just like a bad mickey stelaing uh scene you know eyes only
[01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:56.360]  top secret yeah what was the name of that document bushes and bin laden's because that's in your
[01:16:56.360 --> 01:17:01.880]  book it made international news yeah and one thing was that they said but of course a lot of it is
[01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:06.360]  just uh you know i don't know what they knew but they were you know it was going to be an embarrassment
[01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:13.160]  to our government and you know once again i see our flags in america at half mass for king abdulla
[01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:18.200]  who is you know of saudi arabia let's remember while we're talking about bringing democracy
[01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:22.440]  in the world that king abdulla is nothing but a dictator in a bathrobe they call him a king but
[01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:28.280]  that's well i mean it's well known that saudi arabia has been behind uh the takeover in syria
[01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:33.160]  and behind al qaeda in syria and isis you know they're arming them while claiming they're fighting
[01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:38.920]  them uh but i mean clearly saudi arabia is exporting terrorism around the world yeah i mean
[01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:44.920]  one of the plans of saudi arabia was to somewhat because remember that um some of the fundamentalists
[01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:51.800]  grabbed uh the the kabab which is the central point in mecca and that could have led to the
[01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:58.600]  overthrow of uh of the current house of sound so they kind of kind of deal with these guys
[01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:04.680]  you stay you leave us in charge of saudi arabia and the oil kingdom and you go out and do whatever
[01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:09.480]  you want here's a few million bucks to go up you know play with explosives in the rest of the world
[01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:15.560]  that's right so they exported their revolution right they exported the the the fundamentalist
[01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:22.360]  freaks i mean not that you have to understand what hobbism is uh you know is severe it's a kind of
[01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:29.400]  fascistic version of of islam it's you know mind control yeah and it's uh well it's also
[01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:35.160]  controlled by whip controlled by sword you know controlled by beatings controlled by prisons
[01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:40.040]  it's uh it's it's it's not just the mind that's being seized there why don't we see more of these
[01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:46.200]  big feminist groups criticizing well hobbyism in the in the sheiks that obama's bowing to instead
[01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:51.160]  you know they're saying oh sorry you had a boy in the super bowl and you know uh guys being good at
[01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:55.960]  sports makes girls feel bad i mean they just want to whip american men into subservience i see of them
[01:18:55.960 --> 01:19:01.160]  as their own modern form of fascism i wish the feminist would uh would go after the saudi's
[01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:06.920]  well i think that that's important i don't you know you and i may have some disagreements but
[01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:13.080]  i'll tell you this uh the the saudi's they we keep being told if there are friends well your
[01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:18.760]  friends don't don't send money to people who are trying to kill you okay that's not what i call a
[01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:23.480]  friend i mean you have a that's a different idea than my idea of friendship yes what they mean what
[01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:31.240]  the elite means by friendship is that james baker uh and his law firm our counsel to the house of
[01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:37.880]  sound it means that people like verne and jordan are on the saudi payroll uh so it's democrats
[01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:45.240]  republicans all one little happy club um being greased by the saudi's and and you know um by the
[01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:51.880]  way chris christy governor chris christie spent three days um being offended by the house of sad
[01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:57.480]  where where they brought in bono to greet the governor christie all at the king's behest and
[01:19:57.480 --> 01:20:04.520]  by the way that was only possible because chris christie waived the ethics rules for the state of
[01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:10.680]  new jersey officials exempting himself from um uh from the ethics rules which would bar him
[01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:18.200]  from taking these gimmies from the king of saudi arabia his entire family in-laws everyone a whole
[01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:23.480]  retina was flown over to saudi arabia the party to go to three parties with the king and they had a
[01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:30.520]  special deal in the desert but i'm not picking on christie for alone this is how the entire elite is
[01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:36.200]  operating it's very very dangerous and it's giving these guys a pass i saw that with the fbi
[01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:41.560]  documents the you know the sounds are supposed to be our our buddies so don't look at anything
[01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:46.760]  that might suggest trouble it was a stand down on the investigation that's right i forget the name
[01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:51.720]  of that stand down order i i could see it in my mind right now it's a photocopy of the actual
[01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:57.960]  document yeah it's the i-99 document it says you know like i said it says you can see it in my book
[01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:04.760]  the best democracy money guys google i-99 uh fbi document reg palestin we can put it on put it
[01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:09.560]  on screen for tv viewers radio listeners can search that out of themselves now i want to shift gears
[01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:17.080]  into why you originally uh came on coming up here in a few minutes but um what is your view
[01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:22.040]  speaking of sawties on what's behind the plummeting oil prices i mean i know you've got all the big
[01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:27.480]  contacts you heard me basically say it's a way to shut down the smaller oil producers here
[01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:32.760]  at the same time shut down and bankrupt the russians or do you have another angle on what's
[01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:38.840]  really going on you got it one alex well you know here's the funny thing or the sad thing sick thing
[01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:49.400]  is in my book um armed madhouse and i uh where you have uh uh george bush and uh and uh what was
[01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:57.480]  then prince abdulla uh uh scooting around the the bush ranch in a golf cart some cowboy right um so
[01:21:57.480 --> 01:22:03.160]  the the pretend cowboys are out there in their golf cart on the ranch and just before the 2004
[01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:11.400]  election um the price of oil went from $110 a barrel to $20 a barrel in a couple weeks just
[01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:18.120]  before the election helping uh bush who knows what was said in the golf cart now we and i said every
[01:22:18.120 --> 01:22:23.640]  10 years the saudi's deliberately dropped the price of oil to wipe out all competition whether
[01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:29.000]  it's solar whether it's tar sands whether it's small time fractures whether and and uh 20 years
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:37.720]  ago was to knock out the russians of course for um fighting um of fanatic islam and uh so that so
[01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:42.680]  now they're doing it again i said that they do it every 10 years and i was wrong alex i was off by
[01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:49.880]  one month instead of october 2014 which i predicted eight years ago it was november 2000 you did i
[01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:54.280]  read that in your book and you said that on air it's right there printed in the book which was
[01:22:54.280 --> 01:23:01.000]  published in 2006 i said 2014 october you're gonna see it again i was wrong by one month
[01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:05.880]  you know so you're right they're doing it they want to wipe out right now the uh they want to
[01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:11.160]  punish the russians who are um you know um for whatever else you might think of the russians
[01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:18.600]  they're pretty darn steadfast against the rise of of fanatic forms of islam um they are um
[01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:25.080]  um they're they clearly are very unhappy with uh fracking in america and they want to knock it out
[01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:28.440]  we're not talking about the you know the stuff environmentalists care about the gas fracking
[01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:34.120]  so they're talking about south dakota where the fracking is flooding the market they want to wipe
[01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:40.520]  out the tar sands guys and even more there's there's always been tension with venezuela and if the
[01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:45.560]  price of oil stayed above 110 dollars a barrel you were going to see venezuela open up those heavy
[01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:51.000]  oil fields that it has and uh but no one's going to touch those heavy oil fields when the price of
[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:55.880]  oil is below 50 bucks a barrel it costs about 60 bucks for folks who don't know they've got oil that
[01:23:55.880 --> 01:24:00.280]  has to be processed a lot and the soddies have that sweet crude that gets turned into gasoline
[01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:06.600]  really really quick that's why that's sody oil's king sody oil is king because it's four bucks
[01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:13.320]  a barrel to pull up versus 40 bucks a barrel for a tar sands or 50 bucks a barrel for tar sands and
[01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:19.000]  40 bucks a barrel for heavy oil out of venezuela and uh so they're going to keep the venezuelans
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:23.400]  off the market if you look at by the way go to opec's website saudi arabia is not listed as the
[01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:29.800]  world's largest oil reserve um venezuela is and it's listed as having three times the reserves
[01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:34.440]  of saudi arabia saudi arabia says you may have the reserves but you ain't taking it out of the
[01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:41.560]  ground sucker not at this price so it was shakey mani himself who shakey mani is the ambassador
[01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:50.680]  to opec the oil cartel from uh for saudi arabia and as he says the stone age didn't end when people
[01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:56.440]  ran out of stones he says the oil age won't end when people run out of oil it's when they have
[01:24:56.440 --> 01:25:02.200]  another source other than our stuff so he says that's how he explained the last time he dumped
[01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:07.320]  the price of oil uh and 20 years ago went down to 10 bucks a barrel well here's the big question
[01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:13.640]  will they be successful yeah uh will saudi's be successful because remember also when we say
[01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:19.880]  the saudi's we mean their whole crew we mean their whole crew of uh james baker also represents
[01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:25.480]  exon corp exon mobile corporation the rest the oil majors are not unhappy with this yeah they'll
[01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:31.080]  take a hit for a for a year or two what do they care it knocks out all their competitors sure
[01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:36.920]  they're all involved in it as well yeah i mean they benefit from opec remember opec is by any measure
[01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:44.360]  an absolute illegal cartel it's a criminal it's a violation of u.s criminal law to have a combination
[01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:51.880]  to raise or control the the uh quantity or price of any commodity it is a go to jail crime and yet
[01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:57.720]  we have our president kissing uh abdulla's camel on the cheek our flags are half masked what's that
[01:25:57.720 --> 01:26:02.600]  all about i saw that in london too oh my gosh i noticed that here didn't even do a story i was in
[01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:10.760]  a courthouse uh doing a piece uh for a movie and i noticed they were at half masked is that why
[01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:15.800]  they're at half masked yeah for this dictator in a bathroom for king abdulla you're joking right
[01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:21.240]  no and that's what a minute u.s flags are at half masked for him still how about we just
[01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:25.240]  permanently take him down because he died just worship him well i mean the worst thing is that
[01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:30.040]  tony bleary used to put his zipper down at half masked for king abdulla you know it's and this is
[01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:35.160]  the problem that we do you know i mean so what's happening is that when we say the saudi's it's
[01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:41.160]  really the whole combine of this elite because it means they're the saudi consiguiery james
[01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:45.400]  baker who was our secretary of state well he was as much saudi's secretary of state as our
[01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:51.240]  secretary of state uh the same crew and again it's democrats and republicans there's no uh
[01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:56.920]  there's a bipartisan love affair and when i go to england you see the tories and you see uh um uh
[01:26:56.920 --> 01:27:01.480]  you see tony bleary in fact there was an the house of sound by the way don't just take
[01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:06.680]  their easy squeezy through the oil there was over 200 million dollars paid to the house of
[01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:15.720]  sound in a bribe by um by b a e the british uh the british aerospace company 200 million
[01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:20.840]  dollar bribe and when uh the prosecutors in britain wanted to start arresting members of the
[01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:26.040]  house of sound uh the government stepped in and said no you can't do that that so this is a national
[01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:32.040]  security matter bribery becomes a national security matter this is getting this is so what happens
[01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:37.000]  when it's so institutionalized that these mega billionaires can steal greek islands because
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:42.280]  greece bailed out that bankers debt i mean how far does this go and then that leads us into the
[01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:49.080]  next big subject why i wanted to have you here george soros you name it uh involved in ukraine
[01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:54.200]  and then you've got soros that came out 33 million trying to stir up street demonstrations
[01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:58.120]  with the uh black youth being killed and i'm not saying that's a good thing they're being killed
[01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:04.440]  but clearly if he's involved in something it's for a larger reason uh what do you see happening
[01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:11.640]  there tie it into the imf uh shock doctrine the hundred point plus plan where they talk about the
[01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:19.480]  imf riot okay that's a lot alex let's start with the riot okay um joe uh let's talk about insiders
[01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:24.440]  this started when i was interviewing so i'm an economist by training actually i was a you know

[01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:41.640]  a lot of the insiders and one of them was joe stiglitz who was the uh joseph stiglitz who's
[01:28:41.640 --> 01:28:47.000]  just by the way a couple years ago won the nobel prize himself an economics one twice yeah and
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:51.240]  this guy so the nobel prize winner in economics joe stiglitz i had a discussion with him just

[01:28:57.080 --> 01:29:03.640]  and uh on television and on tape i interviewed him and i showed him the inside documents

[01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:20.040]  from the imf and the world bank and i said uh dr stiglitz it looks to me from reading these
[01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:25.000]  documents these inside documents the imf and the world bank that they're actually planning

[01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:38.920]  about 15 years or longer of really dropping bombshells on this show so get into the imf riot
[01:39:38.920 --> 01:39:44.760]  currently stabilization and you've got the floor greg palace okay well the first thing is is the
[01:39:44.760 --> 01:39:51.240]  imf riot basically we got inside documents which which suggested that the imf the world bank were
[01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:57.880]  actually uh secretly telling finance ministers if if we're going to crack down on uh in on the
[01:39:57.880 --> 01:40:02.520]  workers in your economy take away their pensions etc first we need to shake up and what we do is we
[01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:08.440]  squeeze in uh we need a riot basically and i went to joe stiglitz who was who had been the chief
[01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:15.240]  economist of the world bank he'd also been in a member of the president's cabinet under clinton
[01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:19.880]  as chief of the council of economic advisors but you know that once you get a nobel prize you're
[01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:25.000]  kind of a free person you can now open your mouth and you're kind of safe so i said uh you know
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:31.560]  dr stiglitz say it looks like they're planning riots and he said yes this is a quote we called
[01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:38.600]  those the imf riots he said we just squeezed they the plan was you squeeze and squeeze until people
[01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:43.960]  explode when they explode then you can bring the tanks into the street that's what we're seeing now
[01:40:44.600 --> 01:40:50.440]  with the game being played with the nation of greece and all over the southern tier nations of
[01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:57.240]  the european union like portugal spain italy and uh even though it's not southern is ireland
[01:40:57.240 --> 01:41:04.280]  what's happened in greece is that when they became part of the euro there was a con game
[01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:09.320]  going on they when you become part of the euro you can't have more than a three percent deficit
[01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:14.440]  so the greek government to hide their deficit kind of deal with golden sacks to make phony
[01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:20.040]  currency swap exchanges the greek government played golden about 400 million dollars for
[01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:26.200]  running this scam and uh which you uncovered um they've never denied it that's absolutely what
[01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:32.920]  happened the government says i'm correct i mean big deal uh they did it they got caught and then
[01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:36.840]  the creditors said okay we're going to raise your interest rate because you've been lying so suddenly
[01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:44.200]  they're paying people in greece are now stuck with about 14 000 per person in uh in interest
[01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:51.080]  payments per year that's almost what their entire salary so it became impossible uh they're now down
[01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:56.920]  to more than 25 percent unemployment which was is a bit higher than what we had in america in the
[01:41:56.920 --> 01:42:05.160]  great depression people's wages are down by a third their pensions have been cut in half by
[01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:10.520]  the leaders of the eurozone the european central bank controlled by the the german finance minister
[01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:16.760]  got on shardler and um so you're talking about a situation that's worse than the great depression
[01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:21.400]  but unlike the great depression where we had a president franklin roosevelt breathing or not
[01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:26.440]  he said this has got to end and started putting people back to work and ending that great depression
[01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:33.480]  obviously ultimately ended by a war um but in greece the germans are saying and and the rulers
[01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:39.160]  of the eurozone the bankers rule the eurozone are saying 25 unemployment your wages is cut by
[01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:43.480]  a third your pensions cut in half that's not enough we you need more you've got a they call it
[01:42:43.480 --> 01:42:48.280]  reform and what it is is punishment they kept squeezing people and squeezing people you have
[01:42:48.280 --> 01:42:55.080]  teachers hunting through garbage cans to eat and people jumping their children off at the hospitals
[01:42:55.080 --> 01:42:59.080]  and and and right i mean i go back to the founding of the eu i've seen the different documents and
[01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:04.040]  statements they founded it as a way to economically takeover countries and so just like with iamf and
[01:43:04.040 --> 01:43:09.640]  world bank money the third world they say here's the loan uh you know agreement the things you have
[01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:15.960]  to do and it's go into debt it's buy your products from the very globalist that just loans you the
[01:43:15.960 --> 01:43:21.000]  fiat money and then basically the leaders walk off of the payoff and then hand the country over
[01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:25.480]  to them and then and then all the globalists fly in when they've depressed your economy and buy it
[01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:30.520]  up correct yes and well let me just get to this because what happens people were squeezed so there
[01:43:30.520 --> 01:43:35.240]  were and they got what they wanted they got the riot a bank was burnt down with a couple people
[01:43:35.240 --> 01:43:40.920]  burnt to death inside and suddenly the people because of the riots suddenly the tanks hit the
[01:43:40.920 --> 01:43:48.360]  streets and the european banking system took over greece basically it was a kind of financial coup
[01:43:48.360 --> 01:43:53.800]  d'etat and they started dictating further cuts and wages you have to sell off your properties
[01:43:53.800 --> 01:43:58.120]  they're selling off their biggest port to the chinese they're selling off the big power company
[01:43:58.120 --> 01:44:02.280]  they sold off the water systems and then now they're selling off the beaches and everything that
[01:44:02.280 --> 01:44:07.880]  that is or isn't nailed down in greece is being sold off for nothing for peanuts to supposedly
[01:44:07.880 --> 01:44:14.040]  pay off these debts they call it reform it's grand theft and that's the game and when i
[01:44:14.040 --> 01:44:18.520]  talked to stiglitz himself about this is yes that's what they're doing and his phrase let me repeat
[01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:23.880]  let me this is a quote they don't care if people live or die they don't care if people ever die
[01:44:23.880 --> 01:44:28.680]  that's a quote from the guy who was the chief economist of the game okay but now he's free
[01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:33.320]  because he's got his little prize and he feels he could speak out he was i have to tell you that
[01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:38.840]  when i quoted him and put his stuff on television he was at first upset because he was worried
[01:44:38.840 --> 01:44:45.480]  as he was hoping maybe he'd be brought back into the mainstream as you know but no way and uh you
[01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:50.920]  know he was he had been fired by the globalists as chief economist of the world bank because
[01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:57.000]  he hadn't totally told he had raised internal objections to some of this disastrous activity
[01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:03.240]  literally generating riots you can take over nations finances and take away all their capital
[01:45:03.240 --> 01:45:07.240]  all their products and the ultimate thing they're trying to take with from greece too is greece has
[01:45:07.240 --> 01:45:12.920]  a lot of offshore natural gas and that was one of the things that they uh that they insisted on
[01:45:12.920 --> 01:45:19.240]  seizing which is why it's it's also goes into sypriot territory why they bankrupted the cypress
[01:45:19.240 --> 01:45:24.200]  they want that gas too and how do you get it cheap instead of having to pay full price well
[01:45:24.200 --> 01:45:28.840]  you you seize the you seize the nation and the gas comes along with it so you did have these
[01:45:28.840 --> 01:45:34.920]  riots and now this year finally after the nation of greece had everything sucked the nation was
[01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:41.880]  sucked dry the people stood up last week and voted for a new party a revolutionary party supposedly
[01:45:41.880 --> 01:45:48.680]  called syriza headed by alexa sepres and i had an article about the election that was put on the
[01:45:48.680 --> 01:45:54.280]  front page of the big sunday paper in greece because i said i like you know it's very nice that
[01:45:54.280 --> 01:45:58.680]  that you have a guy who's standing up to the germans and and the big bankers but on the other
[01:45:58.680 --> 01:46:04.360]  hand he's saying he wants to stay within the euro zone he wants to keep the euro i and i said
[01:46:04.360 --> 01:46:09.400]  that's like saying i want to cure my leprosy but i don't want to leave the leper colony you know
[01:46:09.400 --> 01:46:16.520]  that that's the problem the euro is in fact was an instrument of destruction uh and i know that
[01:46:16.520 --> 01:46:22.360]  that because the guy that invented the euro is a uh another economist named robert mondell in
[01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:31.320]  columbia university new york and uh he told me point blank that the purpose of the euro was to
[01:46:31.320 --> 01:46:37.240]  destroy the powers of governments of of working people labor unions cut pensions cut rules um
[01:46:37.240 --> 01:46:43.400]  and you know this he was like the big advisor reagan and thatcher on on cutting the power of
[01:46:43.400 --> 01:46:48.760]  working people in the economy he told me that point blank i haven't quoted i have it on tape
[01:46:48.760 --> 01:46:57.000]  but the entire purpose of the euro is to take away control of an economy from the public from
[01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:03.960]  the parliaments and congresses and it would only be the economies your budgets your uh your exchange
[01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:10.360]  rates the uh the money supply all these things your you know every detail of your economy and your
[01:47:10.360 --> 01:47:16.600]  government would be taken out of the hands of the electorates of these nations he's told me that
[01:47:16.600 --> 01:47:22.920]  directly i've got on tape i've published it and you know he's not taking it back but that's how
[01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:28.040]  this the euro came about and and so with greece and the euro they didn't stand a chance in fact the
[01:47:28.040 --> 01:47:34.200]  german finance minister after the election said and this is a quote worth remembering a very a
[01:47:34.200 --> 01:47:41.640]  good quote worth remembering the german finance minister said elections don't mean anything and
[01:47:41.640 --> 01:47:48.840]  believe me that applies not just to greece but to united states to england to italy to spain
[01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:55.560]  elections don't mean anything that's that's the key you know once in a while they get arrogant
[01:47:55.560 --> 01:48:00.840]  and they tell you what they what they really mean well this is the essence of the private global
[01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:05.800]  corporate government and the worst part about it is they don't like free market they like monopolies
[01:48:05.800 --> 01:48:12.440]  so they're promoting a a type of real low-level socialism of just subsistence socialism that
[01:48:12.440 --> 01:48:17.160]  they're then exempt from and basically tax exempt from just like the frances socialist party with
[01:48:17.160 --> 01:48:24.760]  all these swiss bank accounts and it really is just a new above the law class of royalty uh just
[01:48:24.760 --> 01:48:29.080]  like the soddies are just some thugs uh you know still the second generation in power north korea
[01:48:29.080 --> 01:48:34.120]  is a third generation pretty soon they'll be like the queen of england tax exempt owning well companies
[01:48:34.120 --> 01:48:37.960]  above the law because she's you know 20th generation or whatever and then you've got
[01:48:37.960 --> 01:48:42.360]  sticklets in an article just a few months ago saying the federal reserve is tyrannical we had
[01:48:42.360 --> 01:48:49.080]  that on screen earlier uh and you've got rolling stones saying everything is fixed in libor so it's
[01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:54.040]  not just greg palis the economist saying this 20 years ago or ron paul saying it 30 years ago or
[01:48:54.040 --> 01:49:00.040]  alex jones saying it 20 years ago now as you were saying it's just out in the open and it's not like
[01:49:00.040 --> 01:49:05.480]  these bankers took over through economic uh competition they took over by getting governments to
[01:49:05.480 --> 01:49:11.000]  accept giving them unlimited currency and credit through things like the federal reserve and then
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:16.520]  now they're waging a war against grassroots prosperity uh even pushing how we need to live
[01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:21.480]  under austerity and how it's liberal and trendy to be poor and obama's telling africans they can't
[01:49:21.480 --> 01:49:25.800]  have a car or air conditioning he's not saying you need to have clean cars in air conditioning
[01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:30.600]  which they're developing or have no just you don't have it now i'm gonna get back on this jumbo jet
[01:49:30.600 --> 01:49:36.600]  i mean it really shows that these are eugenicists these are a ruling elite that manage us like a
[01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:42.120]  herd of animals and now the the the the space is getting bigger between the haves and the have-nots
[01:49:42.120 --> 01:49:47.240]  and then they say okay give us a hundred trillion dollars devos has been calling for that for five
[01:49:47.240 --> 01:49:51.960]  years they just called for again last week soros just says no no 90 trillion will do of the next
[01:49:51.960 --> 01:49:56.920]  decade and we'll fix everything by loaning that money to people well that they'll then control
[01:49:57.800 --> 01:50:03.960]  and then meanwhile he's involved soros running around trying to stir up you know civil unrest
[01:50:03.960 --> 01:50:09.880]  here admitting it and trying to do it in ukraine what do you think he's doing because again they
[01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:15.880]  create the inequity then they say give us more power or it will all blow up well i haven't followed
[01:50:15.880 --> 01:50:20.440]  i haven't followed soros i wish i could give you the information on that but he's not in my
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:24.920]  i've been doing other investigations right now they've actually been staying out of the ukraine
[01:50:24.920 --> 01:50:32.360]  story because it's uh just uh for me it's just uh a quagmire and uh yeah a photographer went there
[01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:38.280]  but you know what's happening is that when you say people who are outside who won't stay there i want

[01:55:22.200 --> 01:55:27.880]  and then they get the money in banker bailouts so they use the problem they've created to push
[01:55:27.880 --> 01:55:33.960]  for more of the same greg yeah i mean don't forget that in when obama is running for re-election he
[01:55:33.960 --> 01:55:39.480]  said that uh you want to get rid of what is the a special billionaires tax break why don't billionaires
[01:55:39.480 --> 01:55:46.520]  pay taxes there's something called the carry interest loophole and it only applies only applies

[01:57:08.840 --> 01:57:13.640]  u.s that's question number one and last question if we're really not going to survive this mess
[01:57:13.640 --> 01:57:18.680]  here in the u.s then my thought is just like alex mentioned the other day although i really don't

[01:58:02.120 --> 01:58:06.840]  killed in the mines and i said so do we send the money to your place in the hamptons or your park

[02:00:38.280 --> 02:00:46.120]  thank you guys for taking my call uh greg palast i understand broke the news of the link between
[02:00:46.120 --> 02:00:54.520]  the bush family and the bin laden's uh and a uk newspaper is that right and the guardian and in
[02:00:54.520 --> 02:01:00.680]  bbc nightly news news night okay now you know it's very interesting uh you know in order to
[02:01:00.680 --> 02:01:04.760]  believe the official story of 9 11 you kind of have to be a coincidence theorist because the bush
[02:01:04.760 --> 02:01:12.680]  family always seems to be involved in a lot of these major historical uh events you know i was
[02:01:12.680 --> 02:01:18.840]  wondering do you know that the bush family was connected uh to the hinkley family no i didn't
[02:01:20.280 --> 02:01:27.000]  and the bush family was connected to uh who was it i think the wife the family of the wife of uh
[02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:30.680]  oswald too i believe back i think they were having dinner with him a couple nights before the
[02:01:30.680 --> 02:01:36.840]  assassination of jfk and i believe a similar similar type relationship between the bush
[02:01:36.840 --> 02:01:41.800]  family and the uh the hinkley's and i rarely hear that talk that was in the denver post about the
[02:01:41.800 --> 02:01:50.920]  hinkley's and the dinner you know i have a question the uh you know the these 28 pages that uh
[02:01:50.920 --> 02:01:56.840]  representative uh walter jones in north carolina keeps springing up and whatnot uh you know he's
[02:01:56.840 --> 02:02:01.240]  going through the channels the proper channels and everything but if he's not given the uh the
[02:02:01.240 --> 02:02:05.960]  authority you know they say that the american people and our representatives have no standing
[02:02:05.960 --> 02:02:12.360]  to know what actually happened on 9 11 uh don't don't our representatives actually have a duty
[02:02:12.360 --> 02:02:19.800]  then to to break break uh break free of that and uh i mean don't they have a yeah they're using
[02:02:19.800 --> 02:02:25.000]  national security to cover up greg comments on that i remember when uh they obviously when they
[02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:30.120]  tried during the war in vietnam to stop the publication of the pentagon papers and one
[02:02:30.120 --> 02:02:35.960]  courageous senator mike gravella of alaska uh grabbed the document and read it into the congressional
[02:02:35.960 --> 02:02:42.360]  record non-stop 20 hours i believe he sat there um you know with the real story that they wouldn't
[02:02:42.360 --> 02:02:48.360]  tell us about vietnam he said this is this is america's story doesn't belong to that elite group
[02:02:48.360 --> 02:02:54.360]  of of spook spies and and people sending our kids into the jungle this is our story so he read it
[02:02:54.360 --> 02:02:59.400]  the congressional record and then he lost his reelection he was punished for they got him so
[02:02:59.400 --> 02:03:06.360]  you just need a maybe a congressman who's ready to say um i prefer the truth over my job to grab
[02:03:06.360 --> 02:03:10.440]  some of these documents and just and just read them in the congressional record and say you know
[02:03:10.440 --> 02:03:16.600]  in in the halls of congress and let's say actually want to walk in and arrest someone while they're
[02:03:17.800 --> 02:03:23.160]  congress that'd be tough but we need someone like that we need another mike gravel to stand up and
[02:03:23.160 --> 02:03:28.280]  say i'm going to make these documents public i don't care if that's the end of my career it was
[02:03:28.280 --> 02:03:31.960]  all right frank thanks i don't have time to get the other callers i'll go to you but but but greg's
[02:03:31.960 --> 02:03:38.280]  got to go uh greg palace dot com briefly tell us about your latest book well we have billionaires
[02:03:38.280 --> 02:03:44.120]  in ballot bandits and uh it's uh really the story that they don't want to tell you about the billionaires
[02:03:44.120 --> 02:03:49.320]  who are basically rigging our elections uh you know and by the way they don't they're not democrats
[02:03:49.320 --> 02:03:55.240]  or republicans uh you don't bet on horses when you can uh own the whole darn track right you own
[02:03:55.240 --> 02:03:59.080]  the racetrack that's like the coke brothers i mean i mean they fund both parties i'm always hearing
[02:03:59.080 --> 02:04:04.440]  it's a republican conspiracy that's a i have a lot about the coke brothers but from a very different
[02:04:04.440 --> 02:04:08.440]  angle like when you talk about the excel pipeline everyone's talk about oh excel pipeline in terms
[02:04:08.440 --> 02:04:15.160]  of global warming and stuff forget all that issue why are we running a pipeline for oil into texas i
[02:04:15.160 --> 02:04:19.480]  understand texas is a little bit of oil so why are we sending uh oil all the way from canada across
[02:04:19.480 --> 02:04:25.400]  our country to texas the answer is on the gulf coast um you do have the coke brothers bought out the
[02:04:25.400 --> 02:04:31.560]  sun oil refineries which were buying oil from venezuela at 105 dollars a barrel and they can get
[02:04:31.560 --> 02:04:37.080]  it from canada for seven so it's all about a couple billionaires are going to make a whole
[02:04:37.080 --> 02:04:42.520]  big load of money and people are saying oh those republican uh coke brothers they're running everything
[02:04:42.520 --> 02:04:48.280]  well you know what david coke was going to run for governor as a democrat from kansas i know it's
[02:04:48.280 --> 02:04:52.520]  just it's just a conspiracy theory that you know if i don't want to turn my guns in i work for the
[02:04:52.520 --> 02:04:56.840]  coke brothers it's just just this mindless thing people bleep that they run everything thank you

[02:08:26.520 --> 02:08:30.920]  all right i'm gonna go back to your phone calls and a lot of economic and political news and us
[02:08:30.920 --> 02:08:36.680]  news i haven't gotten to yet but i spent much of the first hour playing clips of megan kelly bill
[02:08:36.680 --> 02:08:43.640]  riley barack obama and others saying look the vaccines are totally safe you will not get sick
[02:08:43.640 --> 02:08:50.680]  if you take them uh you absolutely need to take them and then we showed here on air the actual
[02:08:50.680 --> 02:08:55.720]  murk handout that says it can give you diabetes kill you and give you measles as one of the
[02:08:55.720 --> 02:09:02.840]  common side effects and that it is vaccinated workers at disneyland that we're actually spreading
[02:09:02.840 --> 02:09:12.280]  the garbage we showed this we went over it we documented for everybody out there so that
[02:09:12.280 --> 02:09:18.840]  they could see it clearly for themselves now that's a big deal that they're lying like that
[02:09:19.640 --> 02:09:27.560]  well they're not giving up ladies and gentlemen uh they are continuing now because they know
[02:09:27.560 --> 02:09:36.680]  that they're in deep trouble the system is doubling down and they've now uh had msnbc and uh rachel
[02:09:36.680 --> 02:09:46.280]  madow and others come out and attack ran paul for daring dr ran paul for saying people have a right
[02:09:46.280 --> 02:09:54.520]  to not take vaccines of course his dad's also a medical doctor as well dr ron paul and it's
[02:09:54.520 --> 02:09:57.880]  because they just have some basic morals folks they know how dangerous the vaccines are they
[02:09:57.880 --> 02:10:02.120]  know what's in the inserts they're not just going to go along with the system and lie and there's a
[02:10:02.120 --> 02:10:09.720]  washington free beacon article ran paul mandatory vaccines first steps to martial law this is medical
[02:10:09.720 --> 02:10:15.480]  martial law that is what the model states health emergency powers act is obama's executive orders
[02:10:15.480 --> 02:10:19.640]  on forced inoculations and they're trying to act like you're a criminal you're going to make
[02:10:19.640 --> 02:10:25.320]  someone else sick if you haven't been vaccinated if you've been vaccinated against the flu and it's
[02:10:25.320 --> 02:10:31.960]  so effective how am i going to get you sick it's just not true it's not true but that's why like
[02:10:31.960 --> 02:10:38.280]  ran paul this isn't rhetoric calling it martial law nobody forcibly inoculates i mean that is
[02:10:38.280 --> 02:10:45.400]  serious tyranny and they're trying to just slip it in there like it's no big deal and they've got
[02:10:45.400 --> 02:10:56.200]  rachel madow obama fox news bill o'reilly all of them attacking anybody that tells the truth
[02:10:56.200 --> 02:11:00.280]  they're just like there are no side effects it's totally safe and it will protect you you will
[02:11:00.280 --> 02:11:08.040]  not get the measles if you get this shot all pure bull doesn't protect you can give you the measles
[02:11:08.040 --> 02:11:15.320]  super dangerous one of the most dangerous is the mmr around the world on and on and on
[02:11:17.160 --> 02:11:21.800]  and they're already now so bold they're giving kids flu shots in public schools i used to hear
[02:11:21.800 --> 02:11:25.320]  this and i couldn't prove it now it comes out in the news oh yeah this school gave all the kids
[02:11:25.320 --> 02:11:29.080]  flu shots said they were mistaken didn't know parents hadn't signed consent form
[02:11:31.480 --> 02:11:35.960]  oh we took your 12 year old to get an abortion sorry we didn't ask government is just more and
[02:11:35.960 --> 02:11:44.440]  more doing what they want to do the vaccine companies are secretive they have liability
[02:11:44.440 --> 02:11:51.400]  protection and they have a swath of carnage behind them worse than a major war so let's
[02:11:51.400 --> 02:11:57.160]  go ahead and go to this fox news clip as they excuse me fox was attacking as well this msnbc
[02:11:57.160 --> 02:12:02.200]  clip notice how they're unified just like every commercial at the super bowl was bashing men
[02:12:02.200 --> 02:12:07.160]  and oh i'm sorry you had a baby boy and you know it's bad guys are good at sports it was just
[02:12:07.160 --> 02:12:13.560]  just totally crazy this is unified propaganda you can tell a lot about the establishment's
[02:12:13.560 --> 02:12:18.760]  agenda who would take vaccines knowing this government's history of secret experimentation
[02:12:18.760 --> 02:12:25.800]  through vaccines let's go ahead and go to that club i'm sorry quiet calm down a bit here kelly
[02:12:25.800 --> 02:12:31.400]  let me answer the question the whole point of this legislation is that money has been accumulating
[02:12:31.400 --> 02:12:36.520]  much money has been actually inverting and people are reincorporating because the tax code in our
[02:12:36.520 --> 02:12:42.280]  country is not encouraging money to come home so this is to lower a tax rate to bring more money
[02:12:42.280 --> 02:12:47.480]  home and to take that new money some of the tax revenue and put it into the highway fund i think
[02:12:47.480 --> 02:12:52.760]  this is a win-win-win you lower a tax rate you bring in more revenue and you're actually able
[02:12:52.760 --> 02:12:57.320]  to plug all you have in our highway trust fund what people want centers for you to make this
[02:12:57.320 --> 02:13:02.040]  permanent why not just make it six and a half percent period the problem is that i let me answer
[02:13:02.040 --> 02:13:07.560]  the question let me answer the question before you get going i'm for permanent i am for making
[02:13:07.560 --> 02:13:12.920]  it permanent i'd even go lower on the rate but this is a bipartisan proposal so i don't get
[02:13:12.920 --> 02:13:18.120]  everything i want the other side doesn't get everything what they want but this is how washington
[02:13:18.120 --> 02:13:23.720]  can work together where you have a republican and democrat who have to accept something in the middle
[02:13:23.720 --> 02:13:28.840]  and we get something that's much better than what we have right now so my druthers would be a lower
[02:13:28.840 --> 02:13:34.360]  rate and have it for forever but the thing is is i have to compromise to get something that'll
[02:13:34.360 --> 02:13:38.920]  actually get to the president let's go ahead and shut that down we've we've moved into the new studio
[02:13:38.920 --> 02:13:42.840]  and we got really good in the other studio but we're having some problem with the scrubbing of
[02:13:42.840 --> 02:13:48.600]  clips there'll be like a 10 minute clip and then we just play at the start but we'll boil that down
[02:13:48.600 --> 02:13:55.720]  and find that specific part of of them going after but there's a whole other clip on info wars dot
[02:13:55.720 --> 02:14:05.720]  com uh that is the actual clip of rachel madow attacking uh rand paul for saying and then she
[02:14:05.720 --> 02:14:11.000]  plays the clip of him talking about vaccines so if any of the radio listeners uh want to see that
[02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:18.920]  uh it's up on info wars dot com it's a newer story there's another story on info wars dot com
[02:14:19.560 --> 02:14:26.840]  that we got the clip from it's rand paul snaps at hostel cnbc hosts slanted full of distortions
[02:14:26.840 --> 02:14:33.160]  video so that's the one you got right there it's the other video uh let's go ahead and go to some
[02:14:33.160 --> 02:14:41.560]  phone calls here tray in florida tray you're on the year welcome uh thank you first time caller uh

[02:15:16.600 --> 02:15:22.120]  what's the latest on that since we've got our our borders open well the amaro was just something
[02:15:22.120 --> 02:15:28.200]  in an spp north american union meeting that was discussed and kicked around that became a viral
[02:15:28.200 --> 02:15:34.520]  news story about 12 years ago they already have dollarization with the canadian money in the
[02:15:34.520 --> 02:15:39.880]  mexican peso in exchanges and they're already coming out with a hemispheric id card that's already
[02:15:39.880 --> 02:15:46.120]  in place they're in the news talking about getting rid of uh passports and just having a north american
[02:15:47.400 --> 02:15:56.360]  passport so how they get us there uh can be debated but but we're going into that global
[02:15:56.360 --> 02:16:01.320]  into that global government but right now the dollar is the world reserve currency
[02:16:01.960 --> 02:16:06.840]  what most of the experts and people running things say at davos and what leaks out of
[02:16:06.840 --> 02:16:11.240]  bill deberg is they're just going to keep all the world's currencies but have them pegged
[02:16:12.280 --> 02:16:20.840]  to a digital number uh tied to s dr strategic drawing rights and that's already the super
[02:16:20.840 --> 02:16:27.880]  national money that the insiders use that they just create out of fiat and then that's seen as money
[02:16:27.880 --> 02:16:37.480]  that that that then can be cashed in for euros or dollars or yens or yons or rubles or pesos and so
[02:16:37.480 --> 02:16:42.760]  we're already under this global government uh where we basically pay most of our taxes into
[02:16:42.760 --> 02:16:49.880]  the central government then that's paid as payments on the derivatives that weren't even our debts but
[02:16:49.880 --> 02:16:57.480]  that we were signed on to uh so that's basically uh where the uh amaro is going okay so you don't
[02:16:57.480 --> 02:17:04.840]  see the amaro coming in uh coming in to play then well they're all actually yes it's just not going
[02:17:04.840 --> 02:17:10.520]  to be called the amaro um that was just the amaro was talked about money magazine and promoted it
[02:17:10.520 --> 02:17:16.200]  some globalist confabs to kind of test the waters with people uh it was just a discussion of this
[02:17:16.200 --> 02:17:23.000]  could be our version of the euro but we're just going directly to a global system based on carbon
[02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:31.320]  taxes and a money transfer tax and a uh wellhead tax but so we see a wellhead tax a toben tax and
[02:17:31.320 --> 02:17:38.760]  some others it's all going to s dr's that currently is the dominant system and and what they've i mean
[02:17:38.760 --> 02:17:45.080]  when we send packages overseas with usps postal service it's already denominated in s dr's our
[02:17:45.080 --> 02:17:52.920]  money is transferred in to s dr's to ship something to say germany fantastic on another quick note i
[02:17:52.920 --> 02:17:58.280]  want to thank uh thank your fellow patriots and uh the people come on your shows the sponsors and
[02:17:58.280 --> 02:18:05.400]  your products uh i have used your products in the past and very good and the other one last week we
[02:18:05.400 --> 02:18:12.600]  talked about the affiliates uh and the billboard here um and i like that that's a good idea i'd
[02:18:12.600 --> 02:18:16.920]  like to participate in that in the future well thank you we're going to we've put the designs
[02:18:16.920 --> 02:18:23.000]  up on the website we're going to simplify that and and create a focal point for folks to be able
[02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:27.320]  to go and take different designs and put a billboard up in their area we're going to create a little
[02:18:27.320 --> 02:18:32.680]  link on the shopping cart where people can donate towards us directly putting up billboards uh our
[02:18:32.680 --> 02:18:37.320]  infrastructure is so small and we're getting organizational skills together right now uh and our
[02:18:37.320 --> 02:18:43.800]  issues worked out but overall we're running pretty well uh it's it's it's almost daunting to take on
[02:18:43.800 --> 02:18:48.760]  a new organizational task because some things are really easy to put out a big viral story
[02:18:48.760 --> 02:18:53.320]  that really affects things we're able to do that we've gotten good at that launching new programs
[02:18:53.320 --> 02:18:57.800]  and new things uh is why sometimes i don't adopt a lot of the great ideas that listeners come up
[02:18:57.800 --> 02:19:04.040]  with but the billboard one is certainly doable uh and uh we will start uh moving along in that
[02:19:04.040 --> 02:19:10.920]  direction thank you so much sir we're going to go to break come back and talk to george uh and uh

[02:24:05.080 --> 02:24:10.840]  by the way folks we're gonna go to this clip of uh there's a couple clips of msnbc attacking
[02:24:10.840 --> 02:24:16.040]  rand paul fox news is doing it as well they're attacking chris christy for daring to say yeah
[02:24:16.040 --> 02:24:21.080]  you don't have to take vaccines you never have had to they're like yes you do it's the law they're
[02:24:21.080 --> 02:24:26.360]  engaged in a mass deception but the washington free beacon i didn't realize that the interview
[02:24:26.360 --> 02:24:32.120]  they're pointing at where a senator paul uh was not senator yet and warned of marshal law
[02:24:33.880 --> 02:24:40.040]  was in 2009 with an interview with info wars the mandatory vaccines for illnesses such as swine
[02:24:40.040 --> 02:24:45.800]  flew could be the early step towards marshal law instead the procedures have a long history of
[02:24:45.800 --> 02:24:51.960]  lethal side effects we're gonna play that clip coming up later i want to go back to your calls
[02:24:51.960 --> 02:24:57.240]  george and others but first here is the msnbc host attacking him and laughing because all the
[02:24:57.240 --> 02:25:03.240]  confidence came you don't want vaccines now look at the measles look at the measles look at the
[02:25:03.240 --> 02:25:11.640]  me and nanny booboo stick your head and red tape meanwhile the insert nanny nanny booboo says it
[02:25:11.640 --> 02:25:19.160]  can make you get measles understand that so it's all about posturing without having any real info
[02:25:20.920 --> 02:25:27.080]  here's the problem is the system has dumbed down masses that just go off who wears the best
[02:25:27.080 --> 02:25:33.080]  tie or who postures the most don't matter in the final equation they sit in the corner and drool
[02:25:34.520 --> 02:25:39.080]  it's thinking people that end up actually running society if we ever realize that and
[02:25:39.080 --> 02:25:45.000]  stop taking the orders the globalist so people know you're blaming me for you getting the flu
[02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:51.080]  when you had the flu shot dumbo i thought it protected you jackass it's time to get back in
[02:25:51.080 --> 02:25:56.520]  their face they're trying to bully us into medical tyranny that's what obama care is is a bunch of
[02:25:56.520 --> 02:26:02.040]  force inoculations rationing a care this is the same government that puts troops on secret no
[02:26:02.040 --> 02:26:08.360]  treatment list to die they don't have the moral authority to tell us anything with their history
[02:26:08.360 --> 02:26:16.520]  a secret testing and the rest of it it's sick it's a sick joke man i'm i oh these people make me
[02:26:16.520 --> 02:26:21.480]  want to throw up let's go to the clip go to the clip have to begin by asking did you really just
[02:26:21.480 --> 02:26:28.120]  say to laura ingram that you think most vaccines in this country should be quote voluntary well i
[02:26:28.120 --> 02:26:33.080]  guess being for freedom would be really uh unusual i guess i don't understand the point while that
[02:26:33.080 --> 02:26:37.880]  would be controversial senator maybe you're not aware but there's a huge problem right now with
[02:26:37.880 --> 02:26:41.800]  the disney theme parks having to close down because of mumps and not enough children may
[02:26:41.800 --> 02:26:45.880]  get vaccinated against measles mumps and rubella because their parents uh for whatever reason have
[02:26:45.880 --> 02:26:50.120]  decided that it is voluntary and i can tell you plenty of the people who i work with are really
[02:26:50.120 --> 02:26:55.800]  concerned about their kids getting sick in school he's a media whore she's there to whore out the
[02:26:55.800 --> 02:27:00.280]  american people and sell us lies that she's not a whore she's a pimp a lot of us are really
[02:27:00.280 --> 02:27:04.840]  concerned up here we're really scared right now that disney why the the measles we might get red
[02:27:04.840 --> 02:27:13.080]  spots on us oh my god meanwhile the outbreak was caused by vaccinated people do you hear
[02:27:13.080 --> 02:27:18.280]  me you dumb lady go back to the clip sorry i think vaccines are one of the greatest medical
[02:27:19.080 --> 02:27:23.560]  breakthroughs that we had i'm a big fan and a great fan of the history of the development of
[02:27:23.560 --> 02:27:28.840]  the smallpox vaccine for example but you know for most of our history they have been voluntary so
[02:27:28.840 --> 02:27:32.600]  i don't think i'm arguing for anything out of the ordinary we're arguing for what most of our
[02:27:32.600 --> 02:27:37.800]  history has had i understand that you're all for the choice but again if we're left in a situation
[02:27:37.800 --> 02:27:42.600]  where you know diseases that were once almost wiped out are now coming back because people
[02:27:42.600 --> 02:27:47.880]  are deciding to vaccinate there hey lady leprosy's back in the u.s hundreds of cases you're gonna
[02:27:47.880 --> 02:27:54.440]  blame that on me there's some leprosy shot drug immune tv spreading out of precious
[02:27:54.440 --> 02:28:00.760]  latin america why don't you go live down there in sit in a shack and crap in the corner lady
[02:28:00.760 --> 02:28:06.440]  you want us to live like that you want us to pay for all these people who're spreading all these
[02:28:06.440 --> 02:28:10.600]  diseases and you shoot your mouth off i need a bunch of shots and yes vaccines are a great
[02:28:10.600 --> 02:28:15.800]  medical development the problem is the new world order runs them and jack some full of stuff and
[02:28:15.800 --> 02:28:21.480]  is pushing way too many of them on people and we got warehouses everywhere a little boys that can't
[02:28:21.480 --> 02:28:27.240]  talk and are in diapers for the rest of their life you realize you're signing on to a system of
[02:28:27.240 --> 02:28:33.960]  murder you little piece of trash tramp filth scum woman you arrogant piece of garbage
[02:28:36.840 --> 02:28:42.360]  i'm sick of all you people up there lecturing us she's the type of woman that wants superbowl ads
[02:28:42.360 --> 02:28:48.840]  to say sorry you had a boy all a bunch of pinhead cult members because all she cares about being
[02:28:48.840 --> 02:28:57.320]  the boss let's just get it up here senator we want you to test it fifth it fifth it fifth it here let's go back to it kids
[02:28:57.320 --> 02:29:02.120]  isn't that a problem it's a problem i think public awareness of how good vaccines are in
[02:29:02.120 --> 02:29:06.840]  areas and how they are good for public health is a great idea you know we just uh appointed a
[02:29:06.840 --> 02:29:11.320]  surgeon general these are some of the things that are things that we should promote is good for our
[02:29:11.320 --> 02:29:15.480]  health but i don't think there's anything extraordinary about resorting to freedom i'll
[02:29:15.480 --> 02:29:21.400]  give you a good example you know the hepatitis b vaccine is now given to newborns we sometimes
[02:29:21.400 --> 02:29:27.080]  give five and six vaccines all at one time i chose to have mine delayed i don't want the government
[02:29:27.080 --> 02:29:32.520]  telling me that i have to give my newborn hepatitis b vaccine understand which is transmitted by
[02:29:32.520 --> 02:29:38.200]  sexually transmitted disease and or blood transfusion we're gonna go to break this is very powerful
[02:29:38.200 --> 02:29:42.600]  but again we have his old transcript from our show he says that most of these things should
[02:29:42.600 --> 02:29:47.400]  be outlawed they're deadly so i mean ram paul knows what's going on he's a good guy he's a listener

[02:35:56.280 --> 02:36:01.880]  fraud effort lying and saying dr wakefield was discredited when he never was there's literally
[02:36:01.880 --> 02:36:07.720]  hundreds and hundreds of studies you've got cdc and murk whistleblowers last year i mean one
[02:36:07.720 --> 02:36:13.720]  of them was the head scientist and saying we covered it up i really apologize it's given kids
[02:36:13.720 --> 02:36:23.880]  autism and then he broke down crying at the press club because you know hurting people
[02:36:23.880 --> 02:36:30.040]  well it you want to get right with god you want to repent i mean from a distance watching
[02:36:30.040 --> 02:36:36.440]  these people be involved in hurting children what is godfaring you could say i know buddhist
[02:36:36.440 --> 02:36:39.960]  and people that are afraid to do anything wrong because of karma and and and they have the same
[02:36:39.960 --> 02:36:43.320]  look that i've seen in christian's eyes they don't want to do something wrong it's not just
[02:36:43.320 --> 02:36:48.360]  because they don't want to get in trouble it's like you're very flesh or you're very soul inside
[02:36:48.360 --> 02:36:59.960]  your flesh recoils from wanting to hurt an innocent person the the problem is not a problem
[02:36:59.960 --> 02:37:06.200]  it's natural it's it's it's it's holy i mean it's what we were designed to do i do not feel
[02:37:06.200 --> 02:37:10.760]  squeamish when somebody's hurting an innocent person then i've got the power and the will
[02:37:11.720 --> 02:37:17.560]  to gouge their eyeballs out the problem is is that you're not supposed to do that in the modern
[02:37:17.560 --> 02:37:21.240]  society that's why a lot of these criminals get away with stuff so i'll do it in the information
[02:37:21.240 --> 02:37:27.080]  war i will gouge their eyeballs out with the truth i'm sick of these people get off the children
[02:37:27.080 --> 02:37:33.720]  stop hurting them right now jesus christ our lord and savior said it's better for you to tie
[02:37:33.720 --> 02:37:39.000]  a millstone around your neck and throw it in the ocean than to hurt children and i'm sick of you
[02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:44.120]  people hurting people's minds hurting and when christ talks about the children he means small
[02:37:44.120 --> 02:37:51.160]  children the mentally retarded the old the the infirm taking advantage of those that can't stand
[02:37:51.160 --> 02:37:58.600]  up for themselves and then posing that you're the liberals that care about everybody is pure sin
[02:37:59.880 --> 02:38:05.960]  and i'm not up here on some high horse but you know some woman that runs around on her husband
[02:38:05.960 --> 02:38:12.040]  or some man that does it or somebody that drinks too many beers or somebody that has a temper yeah
[02:38:12.040 --> 02:38:18.760]  that's sin and it's wrong and people should repent but i love how the corrupt are the ones
[02:38:20.440 --> 02:38:25.560]  i knew this guy that owned a payday loan chain around texas
[02:38:28.120 --> 02:38:35.960]  and uh he lived on the road from me and he was always coming up to my car and stuff and telling
[02:38:35.960 --> 02:38:40.680]  me how my show wasn't in christian here wasn't christian there and one day i looked at him and
[02:38:40.680 --> 02:38:46.600]  we ended up moving out of there and i said listen buddy you own a payday loan loan sharking operation

[02:39:23.080 --> 02:39:28.520]  abortion last year because they didn't have the senate it didn't pass two weeks ago
[02:39:30.680 --> 02:39:35.000]  because they had the senate and that would have embarrassed the senate to shoot it down
[02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:40.760]  so the house did it safety and numbers they thought it wouldn't be noticed
[02:39:41.560 --> 02:39:46.920]  they called it a problem oh we couldn't get it right let me tell you how you get it right
[02:39:46.920 --> 02:39:52.920]  they do a cesarean on those women they can pay them 30 to 50 000 or more there are groups that
[02:39:52.920 --> 02:39:56.120]  want to adopt those children but nobody even tells those women i've told women that have
[02:39:56.120 --> 02:40:00.600]  had abortions and i've talked to folks that work in these christian missions we have the billboards up
[02:40:00.600 --> 02:40:05.480]  both the protestant catholic groups saying the pregnant need help they'll give you a job afterwards
[02:40:05.480 --> 02:40:11.400]  they'll give you 30 40 50 000 hold on you have to kill that baby and the to a woman when they
[02:40:11.400 --> 02:40:15.800]  talk to these women who have already had abortions they didn't know you mean i don't have to go in a
[02:40:15.800 --> 02:40:21.160]  dirty plant parenthood and have this baby killed you mean i could have had this baby and i could
[02:40:21.160 --> 02:40:27.640]  have got paid a year or two salary and not had this on my conscience and not had a double cancer
[02:40:27.640 --> 02:40:34.600]  risk uh for for uh uterine or or other forms of reproductive cancer you mean i could have done that
[02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:41.560]  i'm not on some high horse i'm a center ladies and gentlemen i'm bad
[02:40:42.920 --> 02:40:46.040]  and compared to average people they say you're a really moral guy really well still still i'm
[02:40:46.040 --> 02:40:52.120]  evil i could feel it okay i have i can tune into all of it i i get it i know the enemy's mind
[02:40:52.760 --> 02:40:57.400]  most people i don't think can tune into what these people are into i'm able to get in their mind
[02:40:57.400 --> 02:41:04.040]  i've studied it historically the whole nine yards and i talk about it it's like a proximity alarm
[02:41:04.840 --> 02:41:13.240]  and my soul my discernment god's hand on me and and let me tell you that is a humbling experience
[02:41:13.800 --> 02:41:18.600]  anybody's been in the presence as we all are but intensely of the spirit of god it's very humbling
[02:41:18.600 --> 02:41:26.200]  because you feel so dirty in god's presence god's all around us but you that's why i'm not an
[02:41:26.200 --> 02:41:29.720]  arrogant person i come off as arrogant because i'm very confident and very aggressive because
[02:41:29.720 --> 02:41:35.000]  i'm very upset because it's like a proximity alert when i look at these arrogant narcissistic
[02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:40.280]  full of themselves new world order people who know they're lying and don't care about all the bad
[02:41:40.280 --> 02:41:46.520]  things they're doing and all their fake consternation putting down good people the fact that they're
[02:41:46.520 --> 02:41:57.880]  such losers and such traders and such scum hurts my heart and the proximity switch in me just feels
[02:41:57.880 --> 02:42:03.880]  how much danger they're in and i just go ah you know don't do it don't sign on to it
[02:42:05.880 --> 02:42:10.600]  because let me tell you ripping people off through finance cheating hardworking people
[02:42:10.600 --> 02:42:17.640]  raising taxes on poor people the temple was a money manipulation money changer
[02:42:17.640 --> 02:42:23.160]  fractional reserve banking scam and it was targeting poor people that believe they had
[02:42:23.160 --> 02:42:28.600]  to go to the temple to make the sacrifice or they'd go to hell and so it was bankers taken over
[02:42:29.720 --> 02:42:37.320]  the uh the the church and and and christ beat them with a whip and overturned the tables i'm just
[02:42:37.320 --> 02:42:43.320]  telling you that's as bad as it gets except for hurting kids and you people that run the new
[02:42:43.320 --> 02:42:49.160]  old order that's all you're into because you're of your father the devil i mean you people really
[02:42:49.160 --> 02:42:54.680]  are working for the devil and you can say the devil in real all day you know the devil's real
[02:42:56.280 --> 02:43:01.160]  you know it's real you know there's a force there's a good force there's a bad force in the universe
[02:43:01.160 --> 02:43:10.680]  and it is disgust and horror and rage i feel when i look at you in all your enjoyment let me let me
[02:43:10.680 --> 02:43:16.040]  tell all these msnbc and fox news people something and you know this deep inside that's why you don't
[02:43:16.040 --> 02:43:23.160]  like me god is going to break you god is going to make you beg and everything you've done to
[02:43:23.160 --> 02:43:27.000]  children everything you've been a party to that you thought you'd get away with you're going to be
[02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:34.520]  revisited a thousand times and not just you your family that's not a threat from alice jones vengeance
[02:43:34.520 --> 02:43:42.600]  belongs to god vengeance is mine say at the lord you got god to deal with and let me tell you
[02:43:42.600 --> 02:43:47.720]  something all you fake Pharisee preachers up there that won't warn your flock won't tell them what's
[02:43:47.720 --> 02:43:53.480]  going on you know what you got to deal with too because when you stand before god just like you
[02:43:53.480 --> 02:43:57.960]  do right now your spirit is already standing before god but when you're fully in the presence
[02:43:58.760 --> 02:44:06.280]  you know how that hammer is going to come down on you you know it and whether you believe in
[02:44:06.280 --> 02:44:13.080]  entities or not need to understand something humans have manifested this over and over again
[02:44:13.080 --> 02:44:19.000]  in every civilization good and evil and we know where evil leads and we know temporarily in this
[02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:29.640]  dimension any sapien could tell you this that the path we're on leads to abomination death
[02:44:29.640 --> 02:44:39.720]  humiliation sorrow starvation dead people in the ditch and just hordes of flies flies a company dead
[02:44:39.720 --> 02:44:49.320]  me and great judgment is coming down on this country we've killed 55 million babies we'll be
[02:44:49.320 --> 02:44:55.000]  lucky if god doesn't kill 200 million americans that's why the elite are so scared and always trying
[02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:59.960]  to build armored compounds and live out in the countryside and have private jetways to escape
[02:44:59.960 --> 02:45:04.840]  at a minute's notice because they know their spirit even if they're not god fearing they can
[02:45:04.840 --> 02:45:11.880]  feel the judgment they can feel the universal equilibrium of balance looking at what they've
[02:45:11.880 --> 02:45:19.960]  done and realizing that they're going to get it now the washington free beacon dug this up it's a
[02:45:19.960 --> 02:45:26.520]  ran pole men's worry vaccines first step to marshal law and this is just out today but it's from an
[02:45:26.520 --> 02:45:35.160]  interview uh with the senator before he was a senator with rand paul so uh let's go ahead and
[02:45:35.160 --> 02:45:41.800]  go to this interview from infall wars nightly news well i mean the first sort of thing you
[02:45:41.800 --> 02:45:47.160]  see with marshal law is mandates and they're talking about making it mandatory um i worry
[02:45:47.160 --> 02:45:53.240]  because the last flu vaccine we had in the 1970s more people died from the vaccine than died from
[02:45:53.240 --> 02:45:58.600]  the uh swine flu i think you have to use your brain but i think every individual should be
[02:45:58.600 --> 02:46:04.520]  allowed to make that choice for example 20 years ago my parents gave me smallpox vaccine and i would
[02:46:04.520 --> 02:46:09.720]  do it again you know smallpox was an awful disease and the vaccine wiped smallpox out of
[02:46:09.720 --> 02:46:14.920]  out of you know civilization basically only people left with their bioterrorism labs that have
[02:46:14.920 --> 02:46:20.200]  smallpox i would have also taken the polio vaccine i know a lot of people had polio and we stopped it
[02:46:20.200 --> 02:46:25.960]  but am i going to take the swine flu vaccine unlikely until i'm certain that it's safe and
[02:46:25.960 --> 02:46:30.280]  i'm not going to have my kids take it until i know it's safe but i'm not absolutely saying that i
[02:46:30.280 --> 02:46:35.160]  won't take the vaccine but i say you have to be careful you have to weigh the risks of the disease
[02:46:35.160 --> 02:46:40.760]  versus the risks of the vaccine but i'm not going to tell people who think it's a bad idea that they
[02:46:40.760 --> 02:46:45.000]  have to take it because everybody should be allowed to make their own health care decisions
[02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:49.240]  and that's the problem with allowing more and more government there was a vaccine about three years
[02:46:49.240 --> 02:46:55.080]  ago for rotovirus it's a diuretide virus for children they started giving the vaccine but
[02:46:55.080 --> 02:47:00.120]  kids started dying from the a blockage in their intestine which they linked to the vaccine but
[02:47:00.120 --> 02:47:04.920]  it took them six months to figure this out and meanwhile they had already talked about making
[02:47:04.920 --> 02:47:10.360]  it mandatory the whole problem is not necessarily good versus bad on vaccines it's whether it should
[02:47:10.360 --> 02:47:16.200]  be mandatory or the individual makes the decision and sometimes you want to not be the first one
[02:47:16.200 --> 02:47:21.800]  to get a new procedure you want to see it see if it works well before you choose that guy should
[02:47:21.800 --> 02:47:26.760]  be president that's us interviewing him on the nightly news a tv interview here in austin texas
[02:47:29.800 --> 02:47:35.080]  that's the real ramp all not the one that's trying to play politics but um he's a good guy great guy
[02:47:35.880 --> 02:47:39.880]  and yeah i would take the polio vaccine as well except my mother got polio
[02:47:39.880 --> 02:47:43.080]  my grandmother got polio from it right after she took him three weeks later
[02:47:43.080 --> 02:47:48.920]  and she got the strain she was inoculated for i mean that's the problem is that it's an impure
[02:47:48.920 --> 02:47:53.720]  science and the globalists have immunity they're protected and they have another agenda and have
[02:47:53.720 --> 02:47:58.680]  been caught spiking the vaccines he's now going to be demonized for that video
[02:48:01.160 --> 02:48:06.440]  we i mean you'll probably you'll see this become a big issue during the campaign
[02:48:06.440 --> 02:48:11.480]  oh my gosh he's so horrible he just gave a real historical researched factual analysis
[02:48:11.480 --> 02:48:17.880]  isn't that terrible everything he said was true you need to really think through this folks
[02:48:18.680 --> 02:48:23.400]  just like he said on msnbc he said why do we give kids a sexually transmitted disease shot
[02:48:23.400 --> 02:48:27.800]  hepatitis when it's such a harsh vaccine all right i appreciate everybody holding let's go
[02:48:27.800 --> 02:48:33.880]  to george in canada get georgia on the year hi alex i had a question for greg but since he took
[02:48:33.880 --> 02:48:39.720]  off it was basically uh on how uh historically they maybe give information to something like
[02:48:39.720 --> 02:48:43.480]  joseph stiglitz uh what what type of information they really give them
[02:48:43.480 --> 02:48:48.200]  maybe they don't realize that this has been going on for a long time but uh maybe a better
[02:48:48.200 --> 02:48:55.240]  question since you got off on this religious tangent i was into a religious spiritual state
[02:48:55.240 --> 02:49:00.520]  when i got a message that said if a hundred hundred americans would would at least repent
[02:49:01.240 --> 02:49:05.880]  for all the things that have happened whether the abortions the wars the senseless wars that
[02:49:05.880 --> 02:49:10.680]  we killed millions that things would change radically i don't know if it's going to happen
[02:49:10.680 --> 02:49:16.360]  but i i i had this when i was in church and it kept coming back and maybe it would be worth the
[02:49:16.360 --> 02:49:21.400]  americans start to repent at least even whether they believe it or not if a hundred a hundred
[02:49:21.400 --> 02:49:25.480]  americans could get it maybe a thousand americans then would try to do it well my dad's always said
[02:49:25.480 --> 02:49:32.280]  that we should have a national day to repent that doesn't for our real crimes not hijack by
[02:49:32.280 --> 02:49:37.560]  a bunch of glitter bug prostitute preachers we need to just have a day where people privately
[02:49:37.560 --> 02:49:43.160]  repent and don't have some big thing on the mall and you know we got some messianic leader up there
[02:49:43.160 --> 02:49:51.240]  we need to just privately like christ said i repent every day i mean i just do and that's
[02:49:51.240 --> 02:49:54.760]  what my spirit feels like doing because even though the average person would say i'm a very
[02:49:54.760 --> 02:50:02.760]  moral person um even studying this stuff to fight it is dirty i mean it's just i'm immersed in evil
[02:50:02.760 --> 02:50:09.080]  and uh i just can't believe these people want only want to serve evil i just i just cannot
[02:50:09.080 --> 02:50:14.680]  figure it out i can't get i mean i know why they do it it's just it's so disgusting anything else
[02:50:14.680 --> 02:50:21.080]  serve good points yes i was curious i mean i've been researching the these uh banksters how they
[02:50:21.080 --> 02:50:25.800]  manipulated the whole world war two system situation all the way from 1918 oh yeah our
[02:50:25.800 --> 02:50:32.120]  government put hitler in the fact although i mean i i get it the designers wanted the
[02:50:32.120 --> 02:50:35.960]  the whole situation to happen so they could push everybody to israel and they didn't want certain
[02:50:35.960 --> 02:50:41.640]  types of jews uh to be in the in the club type of thing but why did they they go after the polls
[02:50:41.640 --> 02:50:45.800]  for example the intellectuals of the polls was that similar to what they wanted to destroy
[02:50:45.800 --> 02:50:50.280]  germany completely and turn into an agricultural state that is it that's the reason why they went
[02:50:50.280 --> 02:50:56.200]  to the the poll well i mean there's a lot of factions but yeah the Rothschilds uh made uh
[02:50:56.200 --> 02:51:02.200]  people pay to get out of germany when the date comes where the world changes forever forever you

[02:54:09.640 --> 02:54:15.320]  at least five people in live time they've said that the george soros funded organization
[02:54:16.760 --> 02:54:20.840]  they got leaked to politico a few years ago they like to infiltrate operations and destroy them
[02:54:20.840 --> 02:54:27.400]  from within it's an intelligence operation of the banking cartels within 30 minutes of us talking
[02:54:27.400 --> 02:54:35.240]  about it it's uh now on their website rand paul's alex jones problem see they phrase it like ooh it's
[02:54:35.240 --> 02:54:41.320]  a problem that he was so eloquent on the dangers of vaccines but also said that they were a major
[02:54:41.320 --> 02:54:50.120]  medical breakthrough that are a cost-benefit analysis i mean it's so presidential what he had to say
[02:54:50.120 --> 02:54:55.560]  so slick so smooth so accurate and says like oh look you're discredited you're associated with alex
[02:54:55.560 --> 02:55:01.560]  jones and you got fox news attacking me because they know folks we're the model that will bring
[02:55:01.560 --> 02:55:07.960]  them down i mean it's sensational that meghan kelly says there's no side effects or danger
[02:55:10.040 --> 02:55:14.200]  and that you cannot get the measles if you take the measles vaccine and then it can give you two
[02:55:14.200 --> 02:55:19.560]  different types of measles one of which can kill you on the insert we covered this for a whole hour
[02:55:22.440 --> 02:55:27.320]  this is just he's a he's a medical doctor folks he knows this his dad's talked about it on air
[02:55:29.160 --> 02:55:33.000]  i mean it's a fact the swine flu killed 10 000 plus people swine flu vaccine
[02:55:34.520 --> 02:55:35.800]  i was a little kid when it was happening
[02:55:39.080 --> 02:55:43.560]  my grandmother got polio three weeks after taking the polio vaccine and got the strange
[02:55:43.560 --> 02:55:49.560]  she was shot up for do you understand my grandmother has been on crutches since the 1950s because of you
[02:55:49.560 --> 02:55:53.960]  people and it turned out sock knew it had all that garbage in it
[02:55:59.560 --> 02:56:04.280]  they cover up their mistakes you know it was in the london guardian about six years ago that the
[02:56:04.280 --> 02:56:08.840]  german elite the german government and british government and others take quote clean or safe
[02:56:08.840 --> 02:56:14.280]  vaccines i want access to those i want what david rockefeller gets instead it's like alex jones
[02:56:14.280 --> 02:56:20.680]  is a caveman lives in a cave and uh he's really scared uh and he doesn't think vaccines work he
[02:56:20.680 --> 02:56:27.720]  thinks that you they got a secret vaccine fund they got secret courts to cover this stuff up
[02:56:27.720 --> 02:56:31.800]  it's a wasteland how many medical doctors like blalock do i have to get on to break this down

[02:57:08.360 --> 02:57:15.080]  we need we need uh watchdogs consumer protection just like we have on everything else and there
[02:57:15.080 --> 02:57:20.200]  is labeling on the vaccines but no one's given the labeling you want gmo labeling how about this

[03:00:42.360 --> 03:00:50.280]  leon macadam but i'll be on the show whether uh dave thanks for holding her on the air
[03:00:51.160 --> 03:00:56.760]  how you doing there al doing all right brother i just wanted to ask you a few questions that
[03:00:56.760 --> 03:01:02.920]  super cool ads do you think they were set up for hillary and also do you think that all the gold
[03:01:02.920 --> 03:01:07.960]  we used to have in the federal reserve has been given to the world bank and then everything that's
[03:01:07.960 --> 03:01:15.880]  going on in the middle east do you think that ices is selling the oil to saudi which is helping
[03:01:15.880 --> 03:01:20.920]  bring down the price of oil and do you also think since the king is gone do you think
[03:01:20.920 --> 03:01:26.840]  since they have this other guy and do you think that world bank is trying to take everything
[03:01:26.840 --> 03:01:34.120]  underneath of them and back it with our gold the european gold and instead of petrodollar be the
[03:01:34.120 --> 03:01:40.840]  petro sdr dave i think you should host the show i mean i think all of that is accurate and i agree
[03:01:40.840 --> 03:01:45.320]  with you and we know the saudi's are getting some of the oil as if the west couldn't block bank
[03:01:45.320 --> 03:01:50.120]  accounts or shut that down i mean they've that they've empowered them to do this but i forgot
[03:01:50.120 --> 03:01:54.600]  your first question what was your first one do you think all the ads that were going on
[03:01:54.600 --> 03:01:59.000]  absolutely it will be i mean it's all part of that agenda like vote for her because she's a woman
[03:01:59.560 --> 03:02:03.000]  even though she's a big fat liar and a criminal and does all this horrible stuff
[03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:10.520]  you know vote for women a leap forward for women uh by every metric you know women and men are just
[03:02:10.520 --> 03:02:14.840]  being enslaved and so don't vote for somebody because of what they stand for vote for them
[03:02:14.840 --> 03:02:19.320]  because they're black or they're white or they're a woman no i'd vote for a black woman right now
[03:02:19.320 --> 03:02:24.520]  if she sounded like ron paul i don't care i'd love it but i'm not going to vote for a woman
[03:02:24.520 --> 03:02:30.600]  or a black guy if they you know act like uh you know mousetong or something and you know it just
[03:02:30.600 --> 03:02:35.640]  comes down to what they stand for and it's just it's sick but yes this is all part of this agenda
[03:02:35.640 --> 03:02:40.760]  that men have done something wrong men have to be kept in line men are bad people thank you
[03:02:40.760 --> 03:02:44.920]  dav great points weren't really questions it was a great point in the form of a question
[03:02:44.920 --> 03:02:51.560]  alan in ohio thank you for holding hi alex um i recently went to the doctor and got my flu shot

[03:03:03.000 --> 03:03:06.520]  and the doctor said it was a bad batch do you think it was a bad batch or
[03:03:08.120 --> 03:03:12.520]  they always just say that i mean you you have a better doctor to admit it was a vaccine but
[03:03:12.520 --> 03:03:16.600]  yeah you got a bad batch kind of like you know you bought some cigarettes you got lung cancer
[03:03:16.600 --> 03:03:22.280]  it must have been a bad batch no it the they're all bad these companies are bad the big vaccine makers
[03:03:22.280 --> 03:03:27.800]  there are limited runs done by select specialty companies that license it from the big guys
[03:03:29.720 --> 03:03:35.480]  and you can get what they think are safer vaccines that the elites take the elites all over the world
[03:03:35.480 --> 03:03:40.920]  do not take the vaccines we take and i would love access to them i would still do a cost
[03:03:40.920 --> 03:03:45.960]  benefit analysis there's still some problems but it's not the vaccines we're dodging folks it's
[03:03:45.960 --> 03:03:52.520]  what they're adding to them that makes sense yeah now i would take a vaccine of my life
[03:03:52.520 --> 03:03:57.880]  dependent on it after that in fact guys for the special report find me the the articles about
[03:03:57.880 --> 03:04:03.400]  the quote special vaccines the elite get thank you i want to show that monsanto has you know its own
[03:04:04.360 --> 03:04:09.560]  cafeterias that don't have gmo in them and then it's in the news today that that uh
[03:04:09.560 --> 03:04:14.760]  90 some percent of monsanto shareholders voted against and a study voted against labeling i mean
[03:04:14.760 --> 03:04:20.440]  it's just it's just crazy look at this obama wants more money for military spy satellites lasers and
[03:04:20.440 --> 03:04:27.800]  space fence but meanwhile obama puts a limited restrictions on nsa spine yeah and he gave you
[03:04:27.800 --> 03:04:32.760]  free healthcare too right all right i'm sorry i'm out of time for joseph and anthony if you call me

[03:04:38.680 --> 03:04:44.200]  powerful broadcast today i think i got mad so now i'm exhausted uh but we'll see how it all turns out
[03:04:44.200 --> 03:04:48.440]  on the nightly news this evening seven o'clock central i don't claim to have all the answers but
[03:04:48.440 --> 03:04:52.760]  i know this folks we got criminals running the show they're trying to mop up opposition
[03:04:52.760 --> 03:05:15.800]  it's time to stand up and open a can of whoop ass on them politically
