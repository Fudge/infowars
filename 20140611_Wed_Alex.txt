[00:00.000 --> 00:09.600]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:09.600 --> 00:10.600]  You want answers?
[00:10.600 --> 00:12.600]  Well, so does he.
[00:12.600 --> 00:16.960]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:16.960 --> 00:37.800]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:37.800 --> 00:46.280]  It is Wednesday, ladies and gentlemen, the 11th day of June, 2014.
[00:46.280 --> 00:50.200]  And again, I'm going to be honest with you right now.
[00:50.200 --> 00:59.320]  For the first time ever, in 19 years on air, watching the New World Order grow like a cancer,
[00:59.320 --> 01:06.560]  I have never been shell-shocked.
[01:06.560 --> 01:13.440]  I am officially struggling.
[01:13.440 --> 01:19.560]  It's like when you jump off a high dive for the first time when you're six years old,
[01:19.560 --> 01:24.280]  and you're just suspended, it feels like in the air as you drop, and even though it takes
[01:24.280 --> 01:29.240]  three or four seconds, it feels like an hour.
[01:29.240 --> 01:34.800]  I don't even know what to say at this point about everything that's going on.
[01:34.800 --> 01:42.120]  It's so criminal, it's so evil, it's so obviously fraudulent.
[01:42.120 --> 01:47.400]  And it's leading towards disaster on every front, even for the establishment, and they
[01:47.400 --> 01:50.800]  are going full steam ahead.
[01:50.800 --> 01:59.880]  It's like madmen are driving the train, we're all tied up in the back, and they're about
[01:59.880 --> 02:03.040]  to run us off a cliff.
[02:03.040 --> 02:08.320]  And I don't have my handcuffs on, I'm not tied up, but I'm too little.
[02:08.320 --> 02:16.720]  I'm about an inch tall compared to the establishment that's about seven feet tall, and represents
[02:16.720 --> 02:19.600]  tens of millions of criminals working together.
[02:19.600 --> 02:24.360]  But the system's kind of blind, because even though it has overall missions and greed and
[02:24.360 --> 02:33.360]  power as its main propulsion system, it is like a wild animal, to quote Richard Nixon,
[02:33.360 --> 02:38.240]  the power structure, that itself isn't even in control.
[02:38.240 --> 02:42.120]  And I'm not saying I'm powerless, I'm saying compared to the establishment that's seven
[02:42.120 --> 02:44.840]  feet tall, I'm an inch tall.
[02:44.840 --> 02:47.200]  That's pretty big.
[02:47.200 --> 02:52.440]  And I guess I do have a stinger on me, and I can cause a lot of problems.
[02:52.440 --> 02:57.680]  But there's hundreds of millions of us that are an inch tall, and if we all plant our
[02:57.680 --> 03:02.280]  stingers in the establishment, we might be able to get it to wake up before it runs off
[03:02.280 --> 03:06.720]  the edge of the cliff.
[03:06.720 --> 03:11.160]  So I've studied history, and I've seen empires do this before, but this time there's bio weapons
[03:11.160 --> 03:18.440]  and nuclear weapons and an elite that are disconnected from reality.
[03:18.440 --> 03:20.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, the word is out.
[03:20.920 --> 03:23.520]  It's published in Latin American newspapers, it's in the news today.
[03:23.520 --> 03:28.640]  Get to America, Obama, the savior, he's called the savior in the newspapers, will give you
[03:28.640 --> 03:30.480]  free money.
[03:30.480 --> 03:36.560]  And if you can get on an airplane, if you're an adult or a child, you're legalized.
[03:36.560 --> 03:41.080]  On the border, they have a few show arrests that the border patrols allow to engage in.
[03:41.080 --> 03:47.600]  The country is collapsing right now.
[03:47.600 --> 03:51.640]  There's the headline, Central American Newspapers Count Open U.S. Door Free Legals.
[03:51.640 --> 03:57.840]  And then even libertarian conservative media is going, could this be Obama on purpose trying
[03:57.840 --> 03:59.760]  to collapse the country?
[03:59.760 --> 04:05.160]  Could it be that it's a bad policy, you know, catch and release, and that that's encouraging
[04:05.160 --> 04:06.160]  him?
[04:06.160 --> 04:11.560]  Could it be that grass is green, the sky is blue, ducks quack, and fly south in the
[04:11.560 --> 04:12.560]  winter?
[04:12.560 --> 04:16.440]  I mean, where is the critical thinking process?
[04:16.440 --> 04:20.560]  Anyone that cares about stability, that cares about your pension funds, that cares about
[04:20.560 --> 04:25.240]  a future and not having World War III should be absolutely freaking out.
[04:25.240 --> 04:26.240]  People say, well, what do we do?
[04:26.240 --> 04:29.880]  Well, there's a lot of different things we can do, but listen, I'm not the only one
[04:29.880 --> 04:33.080]  around here that can think.
[04:33.080 --> 04:39.240]  The public literally is going to bars at night and watching basketball games, and just
[04:39.240 --> 04:41.720]  is going along.
[04:41.720 --> 04:44.400]  There's like nobody at the wheel.
[04:44.400 --> 04:46.160]  It's a sleep at the switch.
[04:46.160 --> 04:48.880]  We need to wake up out of the trance, folks.
[04:48.880 --> 04:55.840]  The globalists are moving on every front right now, and I can tell you, the bottom hadn't
[04:55.840 --> 04:56.840]  even fallen out yet.
[04:56.840 --> 04:57.840]  It's about to happen.
[04:57.840 --> 05:01.440]  This is Leigh Ann McAdoo for InfowarsLife.com.
[05:01.440 --> 05:06.880]  I'm here with Dr. Edward Group, master herbologist and chief formulator behind the InfowarsLife
[05:06.880 --> 05:07.880]  products.
[05:07.880 --> 05:12.200]  Dr. Group, what have you been hearing from women who've started taking super-female vitality?
[05:12.200 --> 05:17.120]  You know, we've heard the reviews and feedback from super-male vitality, from emails to even
[05:17.120 --> 05:18.960]  excited callers on the radio.
[05:18.960 --> 05:20.960]  Now, the answer for women is here.
[05:20.960 --> 05:26.960]  A new formulation specifically designed for the female body, super-female vitality, delivers
[05:26.960 --> 05:32.600]  10 key herbs that work synergistically to revitalize the unique biology of women.
[05:32.600 --> 05:34.600]  I'm so glad that you guys made this for women.
[05:34.600 --> 05:36.600]  When he brought me home, the bottle's super-female.
[05:36.600 --> 05:39.600]  I had tons of energy, tons of motivation, a lot of drive.
[05:39.600 --> 05:42.600]  My husband thinks I've been in a better mood.
[05:42.600 --> 05:44.360]  Our relationship, all I can say, it's just a lot better now.
[05:44.360 --> 05:48.840]  I've just started taking super-female vitality from InfowarsLife.com.

[05:58.680 --> 06:03.400]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on health care?
[06:03.400 --> 06:06.480]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[06:06.480 --> 06:12.040]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease?
[06:12.040 --> 06:14.000]  It all comes down to one thing.
[06:14.000 --> 06:15.640]  We are what we eat.
[06:15.640 --> 06:20.280]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[06:20.280 --> 06:24.520]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[06:24.520 --> 06:27.080]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[06:27.080 --> 06:29.680]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist.
[06:29.680 --> 06:33.280]  By giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[06:58.720 --> 07:00.720]  This is Scotys John for Infowars.com.
[07:00.720 --> 07:05.600]  I know that most of you here in this commercial already know about the New World Order, eugenics,
[07:05.600 --> 07:07.840]  and all the other issues covered here at Infowars.
[07:07.840 --> 07:10.640]  The question is, do your friends and family know?
[07:10.640 --> 07:12.280]  If not, then I want to know why.
[07:12.280 --> 07:14.880]  Oh, I know it's tough to talk about this with some people.
[07:14.880 --> 07:17.800]  They might call you names, or they just want to talk about sports.
[07:17.800 --> 07:18.800]  They're so poppers.
[07:18.800 --> 07:22.720]  I say so what, there's a battle going on out there right now.
[07:22.720 --> 07:26.120]  The ammunition is information, and the soldiers are you.
[07:26.120 --> 07:30.400]  It's time to transform your game from passive listener to active participant.
[07:30.400 --> 07:34.280]  We from Scotland have had our skin in this game for the greater part of the last thousand
[07:34.280 --> 07:36.200]  years, and I'm still fighting.
[07:36.200 --> 07:39.440]  If we don't all stand up right now, we're going to lose everything.
[07:39.440 --> 07:41.320]  The Infowar is worldwide.
[07:41.320 --> 07:45.600]  Tell your friends about Infowars, and let them know that Infowars doesn't print bull.
[07:45.600 --> 07:49.320]  It's real journalism and news backed up by documented fact.
[07:49.320 --> 07:56.560]  Step up and take your friends and family to infowars.com, prisonplanet.tv, and planetinfowars.com.
[07:56.560 --> 08:16.680]  The truth will set them free.
[08:26.560 --> 08:56.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here, broadcasting from
[08:56.520 --> 09:02.640]  deep in the heart of Texas, Austin, coming to you worldwide on this Wednesday, 11th
[09:02.640 --> 09:07.160]  day of June, 2014 worldwide transmission.
[09:07.160 --> 09:11.960]  Coming to you from the Infowars Center.
[09:11.960 --> 09:12.960]  It's all happening.
[09:12.960 --> 09:18.080]  I've talked a lot about the quickening of the globalist takeover worldwide, stage revolutions,
[09:18.080 --> 09:23.200]  destabilizations, overthrows, turning Al Qaeda loose worldwide, openly funding them with
[09:23.200 --> 09:26.720]  NATO and Pentagon funding, even with medium and heavy weapons.
[09:26.720 --> 09:32.040]  It's all hiding in plain view right now.
[09:32.040 --> 09:41.200]  I was watching CNN last night, and I knew that the Al Qaeda group that they listed was
[09:41.200 --> 09:43.960]  the new super Al Qaeda, and they were describing it as that.
[09:43.960 --> 09:47.240]  And I knew they'd been given a base in Western Iraq to launch attacks into Syria.
[09:47.240 --> 09:52.520]  I knew they'd attacked Fallujah and driven out the Iraqi military.
[09:52.520 --> 09:54.360]  And now they've been given other cities.
[09:54.360 --> 09:59.680]  And CNN was saying, see, we need the NSA to take your rights, both Blitzer had a guest
[09:59.680 --> 10:07.040]  on in a situation room, because Al Qaeda was taking Iraq over.
[10:07.040 --> 10:12.320]  And the truth is, the globalist are publicly funding Al Qaeda with Saudi Arabia to take
[10:12.320 --> 10:19.520]  over Iraq, at least large parts of the West and the South against the Shiites in the South.
[10:19.520 --> 10:22.560]  And I went and looked it up again just to double check my memory that it was hiding in plain
[10:22.560 --> 10:23.560]  view.
[10:23.560 --> 10:26.680]  These are armed by the Pentagon.
[10:26.680 --> 10:30.600]  I mean, I want to start the broadcast just with that today.
[10:30.600 --> 10:36.280]  That's how crazy land things have gotten, that our government for three and a half years
[10:36.280 --> 10:40.360]  has been publicly funding Al Qaeda in Libya and Syria and tried to have them overthrow
[10:40.360 --> 10:45.960]  the government of Egypt, actual Al Qaeda, not just Muslim Brotherhood.
[10:45.960 --> 10:51.640]  In the last year, rocket attacks on military bases, attacks on the Suez Canal, attacks
[10:51.640 --> 10:55.480]  on super tankers, attacks on helicopters and bases.
[10:55.480 --> 11:00.680]  And I'm not endorsing the military, but they look, Christians live in peace and Muslims
[11:00.680 --> 11:03.800]  live in peace and minority groups live in peace.
[11:03.800 --> 11:07.840]  The military got tired of it, threw the Muslim Brotherhood out, executed over a thousand
[11:07.840 --> 11:12.480]  of them so far, and defeated them.
[11:12.480 --> 11:20.040]  And went on the news and said, why is the United States doing this to us?
[11:20.040 --> 11:24.480]  And then it turns out Obama's cousin, Odinga, out of Kenya is laundering the money.
[11:24.480 --> 11:28.760]  This came out in mainstream news in Europe, and World End Daily covered it.
[11:28.760 --> 11:33.240]  And they're funding, they're actually funding the leaders of it in Egypt.
[11:33.240 --> 11:40.840]  And actually, I mean, I used to say, oh, yeah, Obama's a secret Muslim extremist and ha-ha,
[11:40.840 --> 11:41.840]  he's CIA.
[11:41.840 --> 11:42.840]  He's ridiculous.
[11:42.840 --> 11:46.560]  But there's a globalist double cross here with Saudi Arabia, folks, where it's really
[11:46.560 --> 11:48.680]  true.
[11:48.680 --> 11:53.600]  And I've come to the realization that this really is the takedown of the West and of
[11:53.600 --> 11:55.880]  Christianity.
[11:55.880 --> 11:59.200]  And that's why all the rich Jews are leaving Israel, they're probably going to take Israel
[11:59.200 --> 12:00.200]  down.
[12:00.200 --> 12:02.960]  And I've not been on either side of the whole Israel-Palestinian deal.
[12:02.960 --> 12:08.720]  It's just all clicking now how diabolical all this is.
[12:08.720 --> 12:13.920]  And I mean, this is beyond over the top.
[12:13.920 --> 12:17.320]  Beyond over the top.
[12:17.320 --> 12:22.360]  They're actually in the U.S. in public schools and the Common Core and in all over Europe
[12:22.360 --> 12:25.120]  teaching Islam to the kids in the schools.
[12:25.120 --> 12:27.680]  And you see it, you see the curriculum, they're really doing it.
[12:27.680 --> 12:30.600]  And again, I'm not even attacking Islam.
[12:30.600 --> 12:35.760]  The globalists are putting radical Wahhabists in charge of the entire Islamic movement worldwide
[12:35.760 --> 12:39.800]  to in a giant clash with the West, probably destroy them as well.
[12:39.800 --> 12:45.560]  And then you read Albert Pike wrote about it in 1877.
[12:45.560 --> 12:51.760]  The founder of the Ku Klux Klan, the head of the Illuminati.
[12:51.760 --> 12:57.720]  That's mainstream encyclopedia Britannica, folks.
[12:57.720 --> 13:02.120]  Reality is so much weirder than, I mean, how do we beat globalists that are this smart
[13:02.120 --> 13:03.400]  and this evil?
[13:03.400 --> 13:09.400]  We're acting in 1920, you can read the acting papers, they're online, said we will destabilize
[13:09.400 --> 13:16.560]  Germany will keep the regulations on them so high that they can't operate and then
[13:16.560 --> 13:21.280]  we'll put a dictator in, give them the weapons to then bring down Europe and then we'll
[13:21.280 --> 13:25.000]  defeat them.
[13:25.000 --> 13:32.160]  I mean, how do you beat a globalist operation when they fund and create al Qaeda and protect
[13:32.160 --> 13:35.840]  them, but they're real fighters, they're real attackers and then move them around to attack
[13:35.840 --> 13:40.760]  everybody, including us and then take our rights away from us to protect us from the
[13:40.760 --> 13:41.760]  group they run.
[13:41.760 --> 13:46.040]  How do you defeat British intelligence who created Adolf Hitler?
[13:46.040 --> 13:55.440]  I mean, how do you go up against something that diabolical?
[13:55.440 --> 13:59.160]  And I'm not blaming the British overall, it's that model, how do you think a little country
[13:59.160 --> 14:06.040]  with a small population compared to others controlled half the real estate on the planet
[14:06.040 --> 14:10.840]  until they're going into the shadows at the end of World War II, they still run it.
[14:10.840 --> 14:19.960]  The elite that's there, the Transylvanian German slash Rothschild elite, that's a Transylvanian
[14:19.960 --> 14:34.880]  slash Ravarian slash Viking hybrid super demon that won the wars against the Muslims
[14:34.880 --> 14:38.680]  and the Crusades, that's why they were so rich and all the goods had to come through
[14:38.680 --> 14:45.960]  Transylvania, Romania and then they came in as the new German elite and then they went
[14:45.960 --> 14:49.240]  when they got run out by the Catholic Church, the Knights Templars, they went to Scotland
[14:49.240 --> 14:55.760]  and England and set up shop there and I mean, it is just the same story over and over again
[14:55.760 --> 15:01.640]  and then you've got the other power group with the Vatican who wants the EU for themselves.
[15:01.640 --> 15:05.960]  I mean, there are different power blocks even in the West, you got the Russians in the Orthodox,
[15:05.960 --> 15:11.080]  you got the Chinese, you got the Japanese and you got the Saudi Arabians sitting in
[15:11.080 --> 15:12.080]  the middle of it.
[15:12.080 --> 15:16.160]  I mean, this is just unbelievable, people want to go watch Game of Thrones because it's
[15:16.160 --> 15:21.800]  about empires and groups and subterfuge and fighting with each other, the real Game of
[15:21.800 --> 15:27.720]  Thrones is going on in front of you right now and the elite that run us here put cancer
[15:27.720 --> 15:34.560]  viruses in the vaccines and deadly ionized fluoride in the water to supercharge the other
[15:34.560 --> 15:37.960]  drugs they're adding to the water on record.
[15:37.960 --> 15:46.520]  I mean, that's beyond insane and I'm here talking about it and so the FBI and DHS,
[15:46.520 --> 15:50.040]  they like to go to different reporters or contributors so the word gets back to me to
[15:50.040 --> 15:56.400]  try to mess with me as a Psyop, it doesn't really work the way they think it does or
[15:56.400 --> 16:02.280]  to create whatever setup they're into, they go around visiting people, we've got a guest
[16:02.280 --> 16:09.120]  coming up that got a visit from DHS yesterday, he's a TV actor and also a well-known professional
[16:09.120 --> 16:15.040]  wrestler, Telly Blackwood, remember when his video got 800,000 views in one day, the satire
[16:15.040 --> 16:24.200]  with a waterboard, there's Morgan and Michael Moore, remember they shut that video down
[16:24.200 --> 16:29.440]  under request of Michael Moore, it said that when the video was taken down, well lawsuits
[16:29.440 --> 16:38.360]  were threatened so YouTube restored it, well the DHS shows up asking him about me and this
[16:38.360 --> 16:42.120]  happens to other people, they don't want me to talk about it so I don't but it's just
[16:42.120 --> 16:47.800]  you know, a black sedan with two FBI agents follows you home at night or you're eating
[16:47.800 --> 16:53.760]  dinner and obvious special forces people come over and threaten you at your table and it's
[16:53.760 --> 16:58.960]  like wow, you guys really are that evil, you really are traitors, I mean whatever, I'm
[16:58.960 --> 17:03.560]  not bad so I'm not worried about whatever you do to me, I mean I have a responsibility
[17:03.560 --> 17:07.960]  to stand up against you, it's not fun and I don't particularly like that I have this
[17:07.960 --> 17:15.960]  job but I've got to do it because the alternative is turning the entire world over to you, Telly
[17:15.960 --> 17:19.720]  Blackwood's not afraid of me, told him get off of his property, by the way they walked
[17:19.720 --> 17:24.320]  in his house without a warrant, that's coming up, now let me give you the big news that's
[17:24.320 --> 17:29.800]  got me shell shocked and by shell shocked I don't even know how to get into this, I mean
[17:29.800 --> 17:33.440]  it's happening, the nightmare is unfolding, the New York Times is reporting the White
[17:33.440 --> 17:39.600]  House is set within days to sign executive orders and Obama is reportedly looking at
[17:39.600 --> 17:47.080]  an outright gun confiscation of semi-autos and of national registration and then when
[17:47.080 --> 17:50.720]  there's another shooting even though statistically honeybees kill more people than mass shooters
[17:50.720 --> 17:54.680]  every year, they're going to ban whatever else has been registered, it's the Chicago
[17:54.680 --> 18:00.320]  New York model and I've got audio of him saying it, endorsing the Australian gun confiscation
[18:00.320 --> 18:04.080]  which took everything but single shot, first they registered and they took everything but
[18:04.080 --> 18:08.320]  single shot a year later, it's here, it's there and by the way you look at that mass
[18:08.320 --> 18:13.480]  shooting they had in Australia, in Tasmania, totally staged, the Port Arthur massacre,
[18:13.480 --> 18:19.240]  totally staged, totally, total proof and that's leaving that polls in Australia, the majority
[18:19.240 --> 18:25.400]  think it was staged, ladies and gentlemen they're coming, this is it and I don't want
[18:25.400 --> 18:30.680]  it to happen but when, they're already tested it in California and New York, they're swat
[18:30.680 --> 18:34.840]  teaming veterans and gun owners with no criminal records saying your neighbor was concerned
[18:34.840 --> 18:39.960]  that they said you have guns and they just take your guns and then they have government
[18:39.960 --> 18:44.120]  psychiatrists that don't even see you or interview you and say you're mentally ill, no judge,
[18:44.120 --> 18:48.120]  no jury and that's the headline of a few months ago in Bloomberg was gun confiscation begins
[18:48.120 --> 18:52.720]  in California and they're coming with the armored vehicles, with the task forces, they
[18:52.720 --> 18:56.880]  have actuaries that they know a certain percentage of people are going to resist, you're going
[18:56.880 --> 18:59.960]  to be called terrorist, they're going to burn you down in your house and then the civil
[18:59.960 --> 19:04.360]  war is going to start, I mean and then and then by the way for the police and military
[19:04.360 --> 19:10.000]  I mean whoa, I mean I really, this is horrible and by the way they're all going to sit there
[19:10.000 --> 19:14.840]  at the White House and George Soros is going to sit there and watch all this unfold and
[19:14.840 --> 19:19.240]  watch everybody kill each other laughing about it, I know I say this a lot because it clicked
[19:19.240 --> 19:24.080]  this morning why it freaks me out so bad, my grandfathers both almost died in the Army
[19:24.080 --> 19:34.880]  Air Corps fighting Hitler and now a Nazi sympathizer who worked for the Nazis in Romania and other
[19:34.880 --> 19:38.840]  areas, George Soros is trying to overthrow the Second Amendment, free speech and funding
[19:38.840 --> 19:41.920]  a movement, they had the Liberty Movement arrested, they're now calling for that and
[19:41.920 --> 19:48.920]  saying we're terrorists, an actual Nazi sympathizer that my grandfathers fought is now coming
[19:48.920 --> 19:56.960]  after me, I cannot believe how bizarre this is, the injustice of this, the evil of these
[19:56.960 --> 19:59.280]  people.

[22:57.760 --> 23:01.960]  We the people grow cotton, we fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from
[23:01.960 --> 23:06.160]  counterfeit and carting to a private bank having it led back at interest, forcing taxes
[23:06.160 --> 23:10.280]  to serve as debt, this capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing
[23:10.280 --> 23:13.800]  to public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing
[23:13.800 --> 23:14.800]  army.

[24:15.520 --> 24:22.200]  tyranny, and what you see when you look at Obama, Kurt Nemo did a great graphic on the
[24:22.200 --> 24:27.200]  front page of mfo wars.com that shows the seal of homeland security with an illegal
[24:27.200 --> 24:30.280]  climbing over bar bar, they don't need to do that, you just get on a plane, get on the
[24:30.280 --> 24:34.280]  bus, give yourself to the board patrol and they're not allowed to take you back over
[24:34.280 --> 24:41.280]  now, that's on record, you were brought in and then released, and if you can get here,
[24:41.280 --> 24:48.120]  you're basically legalized, it is by fiat total amnesty and advertising come here to
[24:48.120 --> 24:53.680]  collapse the borders and create a humanitarian crisis, and we've got border sheriffs, the
[24:53.680 --> 25:01.360]  head of the border patrol union and others saying this is amnesty by fiat, this is like
[25:01.360 --> 25:09.240]  hurricane Katrina, border sheriffs like influx of illegal immigrants to hurricane Katrina,
[25:09.240 --> 25:14.960]  and under Reagan, the army floated a plan via colonel north who was a marine, but that's
[25:14.960 --> 25:22.360]  who brought forward the plan to set up a deal with latin america to basically flood the
[25:22.360 --> 25:27.400]  united states and use the southwestern crisis to bring in martial law, and that's called
[25:27.400 --> 25:33.320]  rec 84, i mean i can pull up the iran contra hearings where they, there's hours of them
[25:33.320 --> 25:39.560]  on youtube, colonel north at your time at the national security council, congressman
[25:39.560 --> 25:46.360]  jack brooks asking democrat, is it true there were plans to suspend the constitution and
[25:46.360 --> 25:53.120]  bring in martial law and put americans in fema camps, and then senator inhofe goes we will
[25:53.120 --> 25:57.840]  not touch upon that matter at this time, if you wish to we will discuss it upon executive
[25:57.840 --> 26:10.040]  session, said the hawaiian, those matters touch on the classified area, we won't discuss that
[26:10.040 --> 26:16.000]  at this time, i mean all the planets are aligning right now for pure evil, i mean i've told
[26:16.000 --> 26:21.520]  you i feel the dread, i feel the concern, i see it and now my spidey sense is just,
[26:21.520 --> 26:27.200]  oh we now are talking to new recruits through begsis contacts and others, they're now telling
[26:27.200 --> 26:32.080]  new recruits in the air force and army you will be fighting russians in russia, and of
[26:32.080 --> 26:35.960]  course they always tell you you're gonna be fighting vietnamese boy two years before the
[26:35.960 --> 26:40.200]  gulf of tonkin, you're gonna be going to vietnam or you're gonna be going to iraq, they were
[26:40.200 --> 26:44.640]  telling them you know a year before iraq, i mean they're telling them you're gonna
[26:44.640 --> 26:50.720]  fight the russians, i mean this is insane ladies and gentlemen, is latimer putin trying
[26:50.720 --> 26:56.560]  to take my guns, no george soros and obama are, and let me tell you they got their chance
[26:56.560 --> 27:00.440]  to wreck this country, they're not gonna want to miss out on it, they're gonna make their
[27:00.440 --> 27:09.200]  move, and then the ultra high treason, kurt says u.s. department of homeland stupidity
[27:09.200 --> 27:13.320]  and that's the view, you know all they're dumb letting the illegals in, and not criticizing
[27:13.320 --> 27:17.280]  his peace, the folks that don't understand it are stupid in homeland's career that just
[27:17.280 --> 27:20.840]  think they're inept, no no no this isn't being done because they're stupid, it's what i started
[27:20.840 --> 27:26.520]  the show with, it's being done because it's the department of homeland tyranny, or homeland
[27:26.520 --> 27:36.520]  destruction, u.s. department of homeland destruction, in fact let's change stupidity to destruction
[27:36.520 --> 27:40.040]  up on infowars.com with the great Kurt Nemo, i think he's probably one of the best graphic
[27:40.040 --> 27:52.280]  people we got on top of a great writer and website designer, but again ladies and gentlemen,
[27:52.280 --> 28:01.560]  we stand on the precipice, you know i'm just here calmly saying oh obama came out on cbs
[28:01.560 --> 28:11.080]  news and said we need to look at australian style gun confiscation, you know, and they're
[28:11.080 --> 28:17.240]  talking about hey let's have a war with russians, yeah that's another great idea, for no reason
[28:17.240 --> 28:24.920]  george soros bragged two weeks ago to the associated press that he's behind ukraine,
[28:24.920 --> 28:29.280]  putting actual nazis in charge, but that was such a backlash against that they removed
[28:29.280 --> 28:33.120]  that guy that was appointed, and obama kept calling it duly elected, and they finally
[28:33.120 --> 28:37.320]  did have an election, and even baila rusa others recognized it, and he is a guy that's
[28:37.320 --> 28:41.680]  liked by both sides, maybe it's real, i don't know, he's not a nazi, our government wanted
[28:41.680 --> 28:49.680]  actual hiling hitler nazis funded by george soros, i mean i really think rod serling is
[28:49.680 --> 28:53.840]  about to walk in here any moment and i'm going to wake up from some 20 year dream i've been
[28:53.840 --> 29:00.040]  having and this isn't real, i mean who can come up with stuff like that, a nazi collaborator
[29:00.040 --> 29:07.040]  who helped hunt down jews and find their hiding places and sell them out, once my guns and
[29:07.040 --> 29:16.880]  my free speech, and is financing the call for basically my arrest on national television,
[29:16.880 --> 29:23.080]  when we come back we'll play the obama clip, but it's up on info wars dot com, prison planet
[29:23.080 --> 29:30.320]  dot com, i mean listen folks, people that were nazi collaborators hunting people down
[29:30.320 --> 29:39.440]  and run our country, i mean you can't make that up, okay i mean that's how much trouble
[29:39.440 --> 29:43.720]  we're in folks, they hate this country, they're destroying it, they're shutting it down right

[34:02.520 --> 34:06.600]  we fight the construction of the prison planet with the info war.
[34:06.600 --> 34:13.960]  Let me read to the headlines that are coming up at infowars.com, fake conservatives, terrified
[34:13.960 --> 34:21.280]  canter loss will emboldened Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Obama endorses Australian style gun
[34:21.280 --> 34:27.120]  confiscation with video, this is red level folks, it doesn't get any more ominous, tea
[34:27.120 --> 34:32.160]  party candidate, topples house majority leader, Eric canter, another article on that by Kurt
[34:32.160 --> 34:39.920]  Nemo, Iraq would not have an al-Qaeda problem if the state allowed citizens to be armed
[34:39.920 --> 34:44.560]  and I would add if the state didn't go along with the west that put al-Qaeda there to begin
[34:44.560 --> 34:54.000]  with, White House, Obama prepared to act unilaterally again using executive authority on guns and
[34:54.000 --> 35:01.280]  says the model is Australia, red level, that's gun confiscation, illegal immigrants intentionally
[35:01.280 --> 35:06.680]  surrendering to border patrol to gain entry into the US, border patrol says Russia is
[35:06.680 --> 35:13.560]  doing it, Russia is actually abandoning the dollar, this is the purposeful destruction
[35:13.560 --> 35:20.240]  of our republic, the demoralization of the border patrol, the demoralization of the FBI,
[35:20.240 --> 35:28.120]  the demoralization of the CIA, the demoralization of the entire Americana, the demoralization
[35:28.120 --> 35:32.800]  of the role of men, of the role of women, when you study an enemy they want to demoralize
[35:32.800 --> 35:37.280]  you, look at what the globalists do, it is classic attack and then we have all their
[35:37.280 --> 35:43.560]  memos and manuals on record saying their enemy is the family, their enemy is good institutions,
[35:43.560 --> 35:49.160]  their enemy is honor, their enemy is due process, their enemy is free market, a group of hedge
[35:49.160 --> 35:57.920]  fund owners and mega bankers like George Soros swarmed around our lives and I want to be
[35:57.920 --> 36:02.120]  clear I'm not saying George Soros is even a Nazi, he's beyond that, the Nazis had their
[36:02.120 --> 36:07.480]  ideology and were very wicked but committed, he is a traitor to everyone, he's a mental
[36:07.480 --> 36:13.840]  patient who has a high IQ who just sees everyone to be used and that's how he wins, a total
[36:13.840 --> 36:22.800]  sociopath who has a psychopathic icing on top, a hatred for America, a hatred for freedom,
[36:22.800 --> 36:27.920]  it was the Serbs that saved Madeleine Albright and her father when they bombed their country
[36:27.920 --> 36:32.880]  with DU and put Al Qaeda in charge of a third of their nation, I'm not glorifying the Serbs
[36:32.880 --> 36:36.760]  it was a war, they did some bad things but the UN admits double the number of Serbs died
[36:36.760 --> 36:43.680]  in that decade long NATO run destabilization program that ended with the bombing of Belgrade,
[36:43.680 --> 36:53.400]  the UN admits double the Serbs were killed by the Croats and by the Muslims, I mean they'd
[36:53.400 --> 37:01.440]  been killing each other since the Crusades folks, old crusade beefs and our criminal
[37:01.440 --> 37:05.600]  government under Bill Clinton went and bombed him and the leader Slobodan Milošević who
[37:05.600 --> 37:13.040]  ended up getting killed in a UN prison before he could have a trial came out and said why
[37:13.040 --> 37:20.600]  are you doing this Madeleine Albright, we saved you, you and your family from the Nazis
[37:20.600 --> 37:24.920]  and the Nazis invaded that area and killed hundreds of thousands and they couldn't meet
[37:24.920 --> 37:29.960]  the Serbs completely, forced in from Navarones a fictional movie but it's based on stuff
[37:29.960 --> 37:34.280]  that really went on in Serbia, I mean that's what I mean, these people have no honor, they
[37:34.280 --> 37:41.280]  have no fealty, they don't even have a gang mentality, they're worse than that, they have
[37:41.280 --> 37:46.840]  nothing, they have nothing, this is who's going to run our society, people that want
[37:46.840 --> 37:55.520]  to wreck everything so they can rule it, headline Obama endorses Australian style gun compensation,
[37:55.520 --> 38:00.720]  president ignores dropping gun crime, applause Australian gun confiscation, we've got the
[38:00.720 --> 38:04.480]  graphs and more, we're going to add some more graphs in the article that's going viral,
[38:04.480 --> 38:12.160]  the FBI's own crime statistics, 52% drop in gun related crime since 1992 through 2011,
[38:12.160 --> 38:17.320]  they released the numbers in 2013 and boy did they sit on them, they sat on them for
[38:17.320 --> 38:23.240]  over a year when they already had them, everybody knows that carjacking stopped in Dallas when
[38:23.240 --> 38:28.640]  they passed concealed carry within one year, carjacking is wrapping up every day, everybody
[38:28.640 --> 38:32.480]  knows carjacking stopped in Austin that were going on here every week, now they happen
[38:32.480 --> 38:37.460]  maybe once a year when the concealed carry went in, everybody knows they stopped in
[38:37.460 --> 38:43.160]  Florida and the muggings of women jogging stopped when there were a few cases of women
[38:43.160 --> 38:49.160]  shooting criminals with 25s or 22s they had in their fanny packs, criminals are cowards,
[38:49.160 --> 38:53.480]  they want you disarmed and Obama is a criminal, the globalists are criminals, they've disarmed
[38:53.480 --> 39:07.720]  everybody else but the Swiss and us and they're coming ladies and gentlemen, you know the
[39:07.720 --> 39:14.280]  person at Wal-Mart that died, you never hear why they shot some random person at Wal-Mart
[39:14.280 --> 39:21.320]  the supposed Joker shooter, it looks like he's totally under mind control in the new
[39:21.320 --> 39:27.800]  video that we found online of him as the Joker that's up on infowars.com, it turns out it
[39:27.800 --> 39:37.480]  was a concealed carry person that began shooting at them and probably shot them, the narrative
[39:37.480 --> 39:40.680]  of them shooting themselves, who knows if that's true because the message to police
[39:40.680 --> 39:46.680]  is you will not talk about what really happened, the person that died was a CHL person that
[39:46.680 --> 39:52.040]  started firing on them, bare minimum until the police could get there and they weren't
[39:52.040 --> 39:56.480]  able to go on their killing spree to kill more people if you believe the official story
[39:56.480 --> 40:01.360]  but see how they control it, it's buried in the local paper and in the police reports
[40:01.360 --> 40:08.960]  that it was a CHL person that started firing on them when they began firing, a hero emerges
[40:08.960 --> 40:14.320]  from the horror of Las Vegas shooting, gunsavelives.com, the actions of this carrier may have allowed
[40:14.320 --> 40:22.240]  other shoppers to escape, the armed, the area unharmed and that's what the police have said,
[40:22.240 --> 40:29.640]  that's a police quote, how much you want to bet that this person winged them so they
[40:29.640 --> 40:34.200]  threw a fit and they ended up shooting themselves even if they really were the shooters and
[40:34.200 --> 40:37.920]  again if you have people that stage fast and furious blame the 2nd amendment CBS News they
[40:37.920 --> 40:42.080]  would stage this, show if you've done it before, I mean if somebody's your next door neighbor
[40:42.080 --> 40:46.120]  and there are 3 time convicted rapists that just got out of jail in 25 years and then
[40:46.120 --> 40:50.840]  somebody gets raped the next day after they move in and the guy doing the right thing
[40:50.840 --> 40:55.200]  was wearing a mask, who's the suspect, you know if you say to your neighbor, your other
[40:55.200 --> 40:59.960]  neighbor hey I think that new guy might have been who raped Sally down the street, we ought
[40:59.960 --> 41:04.400]  to call the cops and you know have they questioned him, your neighbor would say yeah you're right
[41:04.400 --> 41:10.800]  we should call the police, oh but I come out and say people that have been caught staging
[41:10.800 --> 41:19.040]  stuff before might be involved in this, oh my gosh Alex Jones is unbowed, that's what
[41:19.040 --> 41:25.160]  MSNBC said, you know what I am unbowed, that means undefeated, I don't care what you lecturing
[41:25.160 --> 41:31.920]  nanny, nanny state fascist posing as liberals, sit up there in your little studios with
[41:31.920 --> 41:35.520]  no audience, the only place in your importance because you're reading White House talking
[41:35.520 --> 41:40.720]  points on record, so I take it serious this is directly from the White House and you notice
[41:40.720 --> 41:46.400]  Obama's going with the gun grab now off these shootings, you got a Democrat shooting people
[41:46.400 --> 41:51.960]  on Facebook, liking with Democrats, liking MSNBC, liking the young Turks, I don't blame
[41:51.960 --> 41:58.520]  them for the murders of the spoiled brat Hunger Games guy even if that was real, we don't
[41:58.520 --> 42:06.720]  know, I'd have been, Fitz the MO, devil worshipping Pib, spoiled rotten Pib and I'm not knocking
[42:06.720 --> 42:10.840]  on people that were dressed black, I wear black all the time, I like black, the point
[42:10.840 --> 42:13.600]  is it's a certain subtype, we're going to get to our guest here in a moment, he's
[42:13.600 --> 42:19.160]  with us right up to the next hour and I appreciate him being on hold, before I go any further
[42:19.160 --> 42:22.720]  though, I want to play this club of Obama, I mean this is such a big deal ladies and
[42:22.720 --> 42:28.640]  gentlemen and this is happening because they know the Tea Party is about to totally take
[42:28.640 --> 42:33.840]  over the entire Republican Party, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz can easily get elected president
[42:33.840 --> 42:39.760]  and it's over, we will be able to right the country, fix it, get us back on a good financial
[42:39.760 --> 42:44.720]  course, cut taxes, get out of debt, we could save the country and a lot of the elite aren't
[42:44.720 --> 42:49.680]  totally evil, they don't want to wreck the country, there are a lot of boss hogs and
[42:49.680 --> 42:55.840]  people that are corrupt but they're not evil, they're not wanting to wreck things, it's
[42:55.840 --> 43:01.360]  the psychopathic globalist that hate America and hate our strength and hate Texas particularly,
[43:01.360 --> 43:04.560]  they admit that, they hate this state so much, it's an archetype, they want to destroy
[43:04.560 --> 43:10.680]  a symbol of male honor, of chivalry, of not being afraid, that's why they said they're
[43:10.680 --> 43:15.080]  going to take down Texas, that's the main democratic goal because it's Texas that continues
[43:15.080 --> 43:21.640]  to oppose them, I mean this is like living in a movie folks but it's real, House Majority
[43:21.640 --> 43:33.640]  Leader Cantor defeated in primary, in an upset the Majority Leader who worked with Obama
[43:33.640 --> 43:43.040]  has been soundly defeated by an unknown economics professor, David Bratt, it's, in every case
[43:43.040 --> 43:49.480]  I'm 90 plus percent, the incumbent Republicans are gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, go
[43:49.480 --> 43:54.040]  play golf, you smug corporate lawyers that think you can be asher way out of this anymore,
[43:54.040 --> 44:00.440]  we're going to elect doctors and engineers and veterans and patriots and preachers to
[44:00.440 --> 44:05.720]  office, it's over, the restoration's coming, they may overturn the chess board, start a
[44:05.720 --> 44:12.520]  civil war, you're going to lose that too, don't take our kindness and our reserve as
[44:12.520 --> 44:19.080]  weakness, we're doing everything we can to not let you have your civil war, now you know
[44:19.080 --> 44:22.760]  thousands of articles a day saying I'm behind the shooting in Las Vegas, that I need to
[44:22.760 --> 44:27.160]  be shut down, that I need to be investigated, that I need to be looked at, that I'm to blame,
[44:27.160 --> 44:31.680]  MSNBC, CNN, all of it, okay they're coming at you, state run media, because they can
[44:31.680 --> 44:37.240]  take Alex Jones down, Drudge is next, World End Daily is next and then everybody else,
[44:37.240 --> 44:47.000]  and then the free speech, and then your bank account, Telly Blackwood, Telly Blackwood I'm
[44:47.000 --> 44:51.560]  always saying Telly Blackwood, I've interviewed him many times, twitter.com forward slash
[44:51.560 --> 44:56.520]  I am Leatherface, the famous wrestler, one of the most famous wrestlers, I say on the
[44:56.520 --> 45:02.840]  top 20 easily, that folks have grown up watching, and he's also been on a lot of TV movies and
[45:02.840 --> 45:07.920]  a lot of major films, he's a very successful actor, in his own right, he's on with us and
[45:07.920 --> 45:13.360]  I appreciate him coming on until five after next hour, he got a DHS visit where they walked
[45:13.360 --> 45:17.720]  right into his house, passed his girlfriend, because he burned some toast and the front
[45:17.720 --> 45:21.920]  door was open, he was in the back door with his garden, he'll tell you the story, with
[45:21.920 --> 45:28.200]  two guys in black fatigues with their hands on their hips, with a big guy in a suit, asking
[45:28.200 --> 45:32.360]  him about Alex Jones and other things, and this has happened to other people but they
[45:32.360 --> 45:36.520]  never want me to talk about it, and this is just meant to be a message to me, well I mean
[45:36.520 --> 45:42.840]  I'm right here FBI Secret Service, ATF, State Police, I mean you've been here before, all
[45:42.840 --> 45:47.920]  I'm doing is trying to not have a civil war and have freedom, and not get cops killed,
[45:47.920 --> 45:50.680]  so I'm blamed because I want to stop the civil war that's going to kill hundreds of thousands
[45:50.680 --> 45:54.600]  of you, and hundreds of thousands of citizens, because I'm trying to stop it, I'm blamed
[45:54.600 --> 46:00.600]  with it, anybody that listens to this show or anybody that spies on it knows the truth,
[46:00.600 --> 46:05.480]  and if you want to sign on with George Sorrell's new order, go ahead, I've made my decision
[46:05.480 --> 46:12.240]  which side I'm on in history, and so is Telly Blackwood, Telly thank you so much for coming
[46:12.240 --> 46:16.320]  on sir today, tell us what happened to you yesterday, please sir.
[46:16.320 --> 46:23.680]  Greetings the evil Dr. Jones, as of yesterday, waking up and enjoying my old morning in
[46:23.680 --> 46:31.800]  the garden out here, I was the most pretty smoky in the house, we had both doors open,
[46:31.800 --> 46:38.560]  and I guess at some point around 9.30, two minutes of fatigue, and that bigger guy in
[46:38.560 --> 46:45.280]  the suit came to the door, and asked my girlfriend to knock the couch there, this Telly Blackwood
[46:45.280 --> 46:51.440]  here, and she has said yes, that was really easy to see me, and up to the back door there
[46:51.440 --> 46:56.960]  from the front, sit on the ground there, digging, and they pretty much disinvited him, so I
[46:56.960 --> 47:01.680]  was in the right away, and she didn't say yeah, come on in, and she said yes, look back
[47:01.680 --> 47:02.680]  where I was.
[47:02.680 --> 47:08.080]  When you were engaging in a primitive, pro-human activity of agriculture, that probably freaked
[47:08.080 --> 47:11.600]  him out right there, because that's a sign of, gardening is a sign of, I'm serious, it's
[47:11.600 --> 47:13.360]  a sign of evil to them, go ahead.
[47:13.360 --> 47:20.120]  It's all organic to do, so I'm going to melt them, oh that's a crime, anyways they make
[47:20.120 --> 47:24.040]  their way back out here, and I'm kind of, my back's turned to the door, and I'm not
[47:24.040 --> 47:27.640]  really expecting this, and all of a sudden I come back, and there's three guys right
[47:27.640 --> 47:30.600]  behind me, so, and my big old self, I kind of...
[47:30.600 --> 47:32.600]  And Telly speak up a little bit, speak up a little.
[47:32.600 --> 47:39.000]  Okay, I hopped back, as soon as I noticed these guys come up behind me, and he immediately
[47:39.000 --> 47:43.000]  flips down the badge, like I see this at the DHS, you know, Sembo, whatever, I mean, does
[47:43.000 --> 47:44.000]  it work fast?
[47:44.000 --> 47:47.440]  It flips it, it's all on Mr. Blackwood, that's the question for you.
[47:47.440 --> 47:51.960]  And I would say, what's your name, let me have your card, you know, where's your warrant,
[47:51.960 --> 47:52.960]  what are you doing in my house?
[47:52.960 --> 47:56.720]  I'm not saying you're wrong, I understand, they snuck up on you, that's why they do
[47:56.720 --> 47:57.720]  that.
[47:57.720 --> 48:02.720]  Yeah, then the thing is, I want to ask questions for you, you're currently owning firearms,
[48:02.720 --> 48:06.880]  that don't have any kind of antidepressant drugs, and your name is Ann, I've seen a couple
[48:06.880 --> 48:11.040]  other things, so I'm just sitting here like, what the hell are these guys, what is it?
[48:11.040 --> 48:12.040]  And that thing is all on...
[48:12.040 --> 48:16.640]  So if they've asked me those questions, I just asked them, simply, okay, my question
[48:16.640 --> 48:20.040]  is for you, do you have a warrant or, you know, a reason why you're here?
[48:20.040 --> 48:24.560]  And I'm just kind of totally confused, and he started putting out some kind of code with
[48:24.560 --> 48:28.360]  them, you know, a number and a letter at the end of it, and I have a right to investigate
[48:28.360 --> 48:30.160]  and talk to you here, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[48:30.160 --> 48:32.880]  Yeah, no, no, they have a right to come knock on your door and try to talk to you, you have
[48:32.880 --> 48:35.400]  no responsibility to talk to them.
[48:35.400 --> 48:36.400]  Yeah, well...
[48:36.400 --> 48:41.840]  But you should not have walked into your house, that all the file address pass can play on
[48:41.840 --> 48:42.840]  record.
[48:42.840 --> 48:46.960]  So I asked him, like, well, do you have a warrant or just, who lets you in?
[48:46.960 --> 48:51.360]  You know, then he just kept mumbling, show me, go ahead and answer my question and ask
[48:51.360 --> 48:54.760]  me, and what is your affiliation with Alex Jones?
[48:54.760 --> 48:58.400]  And he named a couple other names real fast, like the third name was Louis or something
[48:58.400 --> 49:02.120]  like that, and I didn't recognize any of the names, so I said, well, I'm a filmmaker,
[49:02.120 --> 49:06.720]  I do some little things with them here and there, I'm a patriot, I mirror, you know,
[49:06.720 --> 49:11.640]  other articles, and I'm into real journalism, you know, that was pretty much it.
[49:11.640 --> 49:17.080]  And, you know, at that time, my girlfriend broke her head out the door, and I just told
[49:17.080 --> 49:22.600]  them, you know, yes, gotta leave, but that's just the end of it, you know, and they pretty
[49:22.600 --> 49:27.080]  much told her, so that said, record them, they just told her, point her, you, no, you
[49:27.080 --> 49:28.080]  cannot record us.
[49:28.080 --> 49:33.240]  By the way, on your own property, total first amendment, and if it's in public, you can
[49:33.240 --> 49:34.800]  film, so they try to tell her, don't film us.
[49:34.800 --> 49:37.800]  Oh, you know, there's no such thing as the first amendment, Alex.
[49:37.800 --> 49:43.360]  But anyways, so I told her, you know, I told her, you know, yes, film anyway, it's a private
[49:43.360 --> 49:44.360]  property.
[49:44.360 --> 49:47.240]  You know, immediately right then, you know, she's already kind of shaken up like what
[49:47.240 --> 49:48.480]  the world's going on here.
[49:48.480 --> 49:52.480]  So right then, he has kind of looked at us, we're watching you, Mr. Blackwood, then they
[49:52.480 --> 49:57.000]  walk out with these two big, starling thugs at the batis.
[49:57.000 --> 50:01.120]  And so Anthony has kind of stormed their way out, and I'm just, you know, I hadn't heard
[50:01.120 --> 50:05.840]  a phone, I just try to run in and get the GoPro camera right out there and try to get
[50:05.840 --> 50:09.120]  a shot, because they'll leave, but I was just, you know, they got there fast enough.
[50:09.120 --> 50:14.240]  I mean, these guys are dressed up to play army, and they really want to war with us.
[50:14.240 --> 50:16.880]  I mean, I don't know, they show up with two guys in black fatigues.
[50:16.880 --> 50:19.520]  I'm just going to start laughing at them, like, give me a break, man.
[50:19.520 --> 50:24.040]  Don't join the army and find Al Qaeda that works for you.
[50:24.040 --> 50:25.040]  Literally.
[50:25.040 --> 50:27.880]  I mean, these people work for a government that runs Al Qaeda.
[50:27.880 --> 50:29.120]  This is not our government.
[50:29.120 --> 50:34.920]  This is a group of collaborators, even if they're not bad people, they work for an occupational,
[50:34.920 --> 50:36.920]  literal VC French operation.
[50:36.920 --> 50:48.440]  Well, stay there, Telly Blackwood.

[52:13.840 --> 52:14.840]  quick buck.
[52:14.840 --> 52:19.160]  Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born.

[52:28.440 --> 52:29.440]  and women.

[54:10.920 --> 54:14.720]  He was just telling me during the break for his son, I think he was saying.
[54:14.720 --> 54:21.280]  So that's what it comes down to is just dropping everything to fight tyranny.
[54:21.280 --> 54:24.800]  And that's what it takes to see the long list of TV shows he's been on, movies you name
[54:24.800 --> 54:25.800]  it.

[54:26.800 --> 54:27.800]  Dropping it all.
[54:27.800 --> 54:30.520]  He just told me to fight the new world order because that's all there is.
[54:30.520 --> 54:33.840]  There's no future of these people when they're going to shut everything down.
[54:33.840 --> 54:34.840]  That's their goal.
[54:34.840 --> 54:38.280]  It's called Gen 21, Cloward and Piven.
[54:38.280 --> 54:41.360]  The food babes popping in with a really exciting new initiative to try to clean up the food
[54:41.360 --> 54:43.520]  supply.

[54:51.000 --> 54:53.600]  Rudge carried it last week.
[54:53.600 --> 54:55.520]  And she writes about the archetype of the Joker.
[54:55.520 --> 54:59.560]  Why is it associated with so many senseless killings?
[54:59.560 --> 55:00.840]  It ties into all this and more.
[55:00.840 --> 55:07.000]  But before I go any further, we already have the lowest price on the best gravity-fed filters

[57:05.200 --> 57:09.680]  whatever gods may be for my unconquerable soul.
[57:09.680 --> 57:14.840]  If the fell clutch of circumstance I have not winced nor cried aloud, under the bludgeonings
[57:14.840 --> 57:18.840]  of chance my head is bloody but unbowed.
[57:18.840 --> 57:23.720]  Because that's what MSNBC said is I'm unbowed, that's right, until the end.
[57:23.720 --> 57:28.600]  Beyond this place of wrath and tears, looms, but the horror of the shade, and yet the menace
[57:28.600 --> 57:31.960]  of the years finds and shall find me unafraid.
[57:31.960 --> 57:37.160]  It matters not how straight the gate, how charged with punishments the scroll.

[58:05.280 --> 58:06.280]  bad guy.
[58:06.280 --> 58:07.280]  Go ahead, telly.
[58:07.280 --> 58:12.280]  Well, when he said that, I guess it wasn't the first time I've heard that before, so
[58:12.280 --> 58:14.480]  it wasn't that much of a shocker.
[58:14.480 --> 58:15.480]  They're watching me.
[58:15.480 --> 58:19.480]  Yeah, okay, so you're really, yeah, silly, out of no lives, the other thing you could

[58:22.480 --> 58:23.480]  I don't think they realize that.
[58:23.480 --> 58:24.480]  I don't know.
[58:24.480 --> 58:25.480]  I mean.
[58:25.480 --> 58:26.480]  Yeah, no, no.
[58:26.480 --> 58:30.560]  Now, you describe these guys in Black Commando outfits with their hands.

[58:48.960 --> 58:53.120]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[58:53.120 --> 58:57.560]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[58:57.560 --> 59:01.120]  There are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water.
[59:01.120 --> 59:04.080]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[59:04.080 --> 59:08.000]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect
[59:08.000 --> 59:11.680]  you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[59:11.680 --> 59:15.640]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[59:15.640 --> 59:20.200]  Few filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[59:20.200 --> 59:25.360]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[59:25.360 --> 59:29.560]  All right, it is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in breads, it's in toothpaste.
[59:29.560 --> 59:32.720]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[59:32.720 --> 59:34.240]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[59:34.240 --> 59:35.600]  It's time to take action.

[59:57.680 --> 1:00:27.080]  We wish to be the captains of our own soul and
[1:00:27.080 --> 1:00:36.360]  destiny free will given to us by the God of good, but the devils of control wish to end
[1:00:36.360 --> 1:00:43.160]  our free will and create an artificial consciousness, a programmable biological android race, a
[1:00:43.160 --> 1:00:50.120]  trophy to their victory against the species as if they came from trillions of miles away
[1:00:50.120 --> 1:00:57.640]  from dark stars in the nebula of the horse head, but no, they came from our own planet,
[1:00:57.640 --> 1:01:08.640]  twisted and evil, turned over to the cheaters' heart through their weakness, destined to
[1:01:08.640 --> 1:01:14.480]  fall from the foundations of the earth.
[1:01:14.480 --> 1:01:18.160]  Let's go ahead and go back to Telly, Blackwood Telly, you've got the four of the last four
[1:01:18.160 --> 1:01:21.160]  minutes of this segment, tell us about some of the media stuff you're doing, where this
[1:01:21.160 --> 1:01:26.080]  is going, but first, why do you think they wanted to come to you and ask you about Alex
[1:01:26.080 --> 1:01:29.320]  Jones and say you're being watched when you've just entered some of our contests, we've
[1:01:29.320 --> 1:01:33.640]  interviewed you four or five times, like your work, I mean, that's, I mean, I think
[1:01:33.640 --> 1:01:38.200]  it's just to intimidate you and to get the message to me.
[1:01:38.200 --> 1:01:42.640]  I think it was really a get the message to you kind of thing, and I'm pretty sure they
[1:01:42.640 --> 1:01:44.320]  would know you got the first person to call.
[1:01:44.320 --> 1:01:48.760]  I didn't know there was a tyranny and they diesel people to death in federal vehicles
[1:01:48.760 --> 1:01:52.760]  and that they torture kids and run snuff film operations, I didn't know they could kill
[1:01:52.760 --> 1:02:00.480]  me and my family, I'm so scared now, I didn't know they were evil, Telly.
[1:02:00.480 --> 1:02:04.360]  Well, the funny thing is, other than the guy talking to the suit, he was the only one
[1:02:04.360 --> 1:02:09.040]  that said any words, two big bugs that sat there and snarled, but I guess they're into
[1:02:09.040 --> 1:02:14.520]  black fatigues, not arms, plain black, you know, fatigues with boots and, you know, short
[1:02:14.520 --> 1:02:15.520]  trim there.
[1:02:15.520 --> 1:02:17.600]  It's not like they just kind of have their hands on their hip or cross behind their back
[1:02:17.600 --> 1:02:23.400]  and just snarled and tried to stare at me, not even blink the whole time, but I had a
[1:02:23.400 --> 1:02:27.000]  lot of military in the family and everything, so I'm not really that stupid about staring
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:28.000]  at me.
[1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  You know what I mean?
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:31.960]  But this effect though coming in and trying to, you know, first I thought it was a joke
[1:02:31.960 --> 1:02:32.960]  to be honest.
[1:02:32.960 --> 1:02:33.960]  I'm like, what is going on here?
[1:02:33.960 --> 1:02:34.960]  Okay, where's the camera?
[1:02:34.960 --> 1:02:35.960]  Where's the camera?
[1:02:35.960 --> 1:02:40.480]  That's the problem is them bugging their eyes out, even radiating, they want to just rip
[1:02:40.480 --> 1:02:41.480]  your head off.
[1:02:41.480 --> 1:02:45.680]  And they have this, the ATF came here one time and there was this one really like big
[1:02:45.680 --> 1:02:49.640]  guy you could tell you, he was like solid muscle and he was just going, just looking
[1:02:49.640 --> 1:02:54.000]  at me, just, and I'm just like, you know, it's just, it's just like God, the dishonor
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  of these people.
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:03:00.880]  I mean, the dishonor, they're so weak, they think evil is powerful, they worship at that
[1:03:00.880 --> 1:03:01.880]  dark throne.
[1:03:01.880 --> 1:03:02.880]  Go ahead.
[1:03:02.880 --> 1:03:06.560]  I mean, I've been a wrestler for a lot of years, you know, a lot bigger, meaner people
[1:03:06.560 --> 1:03:07.560]  than those guys.
[1:03:07.560 --> 1:03:12.040]  So them strong at me has, they all cry for their mama in the end.
[1:03:12.040 --> 1:03:13.040]  Yeah.
[1:03:13.040 --> 1:03:14.040]  Everybody does.
[1:03:14.040 --> 1:03:17.640]  And we all go the same way and don't believe the same color and everything.
[1:03:17.640 --> 1:03:19.640]  So I mean, I don't understand.
[1:03:19.640 --> 1:03:21.160]  I mean, I know it's a intimidation thing.
[1:03:21.160 --> 1:03:24.880]  I know they're trying to, trying to get the message to you or like I was telling bigs
[1:03:24.880 --> 1:03:25.880]  on Facebook.
[1:03:25.880 --> 1:03:28.680]  I was saying, you know, it almost feels like it feels too perfect.
[1:03:28.680 --> 1:03:32.760]  It's almost like they want me to go and talk to you guys and get this on there.
[1:03:32.760 --> 1:03:35.760]  You know, watch the all behind that, trying to be paranoid.
[1:03:35.760 --> 1:03:37.960]  No, no, they think we're all cowards.
[1:03:37.960 --> 1:03:39.560]  They think everybody will hear this and get scared.
[1:03:39.560 --> 1:03:40.560]  That's the whole thing.
[1:03:40.560 --> 1:03:41.560]  Better not listen to Alex Jones.
[1:03:41.560 --> 1:03:42.560]  Better not be involved.
[1:03:42.560 --> 1:03:43.560]  Why?
[1:03:43.560 --> 1:03:45.360]  They just lowered the borders completely.
[1:03:45.360 --> 1:03:46.560]  They're coming after our guns.
[1:03:46.560 --> 1:03:49.840]  If we don't expose it, then we lose everything.
[1:03:49.840 --> 1:03:50.840]  That's the thing.
[1:03:50.840 --> 1:03:51.840]  I'm not a hero.
[1:03:51.840 --> 1:03:52.840]  Tell it.
[1:03:52.840 --> 1:03:53.840]  You're not either.
[1:03:53.840 --> 1:03:54.840]  We have to stand up against this.
[1:03:54.840 --> 1:03:57.520]  I mean, they're arresting Tea Party people.
[1:03:57.520 --> 1:04:00.000]  They're arresting the next Suza.
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:03.320]  They're the IRS is going after Christian groups.
[1:04:03.320 --> 1:04:08.880]  And the aircoater button is a little Homeland Terrorist Task Force together, a FEMA camp.
[1:04:08.880 --> 1:04:11.560]  The NBA, what do people think that's for?
[1:04:11.560 --> 1:04:12.560]  It's not for good television.
[1:04:12.560 --> 1:04:14.560]  I mean, why do you think it's going to happen?
[1:04:14.560 --> 1:04:16.160]  Why do you think it's happening for?
[1:04:16.160 --> 1:04:17.160]  Exactly.
[1:04:17.160 --> 1:04:20.320]  Tell us about the new show you're going to launch and the website with the news articles
[1:04:20.320 --> 1:04:21.320]  you're writing.
[1:04:21.320 --> 1:04:22.320]  You're welcome to write for us, but go ahead.
[1:04:22.320 --> 1:04:24.320]  Oh, I mean, I'd love to do that.
[1:04:24.320 --> 1:04:28.720]  I started a little news line on Blackwood says, I'd also like to get a little podcast
[1:04:28.720 --> 1:04:29.720]  together.
[1:04:29.720 --> 1:04:36.880]  So give us the web address of your articles, articles, I believe is news, buying.com, slash
[1:04:36.880 --> 1:04:41.640]  Blackwood says, so Blackwood says, we're going to talk to you again soon.
[1:04:41.640 --> 1:04:42.640]  Thanks for coming on.
[1:04:42.640 --> 1:04:45.480]  Please do a YouTube video or something reporting what happened to you.
[1:04:45.480 --> 1:04:47.040]  So it's all concise.
[1:04:47.040 --> 1:04:49.200]  And we're riding along with you, brother.
[1:04:49.200 --> 1:04:50.200]  It's a good thing.
[1:04:50.200 --> 1:04:51.200]  They showed up.
[1:04:51.200 --> 1:04:54.520]  They don't like the fact we're exposing that terrorists took over the government and
[1:04:54.520 --> 1:04:56.200]  that Homeland Security runs al-Qaeda.
[1:04:56.200 --> 1:04:57.200]  We'll be back.
[1:04:57.200 --> 1:04:58.200]  Stay with us.
[1:04:58.200 --> 1:05:02.280]  This is Leigh Ann McAdoo for infowarslife.com.
[1:05:02.280 --> 1:05:07.440]  I'm here with Dr. Edward Group, master herbologist and chief formulator behind the Info Wars
[1:05:07.440 --> 1:05:08.440]  Life products.
[1:05:08.440 --> 1:05:13.040]  Dr. Group, what have you been hearing from women who've started taking superfemale vitality?
[1:05:13.040 --> 1:05:17.960]  You know, we've heard the reviews and feedback from supermale vitality from emails to even
[1:05:17.960 --> 1:05:19.840]  excited callers on the radio.
[1:05:19.840 --> 1:05:21.800]  Now, the answer for women is here.
[1:05:21.800 --> 1:05:27.800]  A new formulation specifically designed for the female body superfemale vitality delivers

[1:05:33.440 --> 1:05:35.440]  I'm still glad that you guys made this for women.
[1:05:35.440 --> 1:05:37.440]  When he brought me home, the bottle's superfemale.
[1:05:37.440 --> 1:05:40.440]  I had tons of energy, tons of motivation, a lot of drive.
[1:05:40.440 --> 1:05:43.440]  My husband thinks I've been in a better mood.
[1:05:43.440 --> 1:05:45.200]  Our relationship, all I can say is this is a lot better now.
[1:05:45.200 --> 1:05:49.680]  I've just started taking superfemale vitality from infowarslife.com.

[1:05:58.920 --> 1:06:02.440]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Groot.
[1:06:02.440 --> 1:06:08.120]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity
[1:06:08.120 --> 1:06:09.880]  iodine available.
[1:06:09.880 --> 1:06:18.360]  The new survival shield X2 is mined from 7 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine,
[1:06:18.360 --> 1:06:20.720]  environmentally clean conditions.
[1:06:20.720 --> 1:06:27.720]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient, 300 million plus year old
[1:06:27.720 --> 1:06:30.240]  deposit deep in the earth.
[1:06:30.240 --> 1:06:34.720]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[1:06:34.720 --> 1:06:39.040]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[1:06:39.040 --> 1:06:41.160]  Experience the new formula.

[1:06:58.560 --> 1:07:00.560]  This is Scotys John for infowars.com.
[1:07:00.560 --> 1:07:05.440]  I know that most of you here in this commercial already know about the New World Order, eugenics,
[1:07:05.440 --> 1:07:07.680]  and all the other issues covered here at Infowars.
[1:07:07.680 --> 1:07:10.480]  The question is, do your friends and family know?
[1:07:10.480 --> 1:07:12.160]  If not, then I want to know why.
[1:07:12.160 --> 1:07:14.720]  Oh, I know it's tough to talk about this with some people.
[1:07:14.720 --> 1:07:19.080]  They might call you names, or they just want to talk about sports, or soap operas.
[1:07:19.080 --> 1:07:20.080]  I say, so what?
[1:07:20.080 --> 1:07:22.560]  There's a battle going on out there right now.
[1:07:22.560 --> 1:07:25.960]  The ammunition is information, and the soldiers are you.
[1:07:25.960 --> 1:07:30.240]  It's time to transform your game from passive listener to active participant.
[1:07:30.240 --> 1:07:34.120]  We from Scotland have had our skin in this game for the greater part of the last thousand
[1:07:34.120 --> 1:07:35.120]  years.
[1:07:35.120 --> 1:07:36.120]  And I'm still fighting.
[1:07:36.120 --> 1:07:39.280]  If we don't all stand up right now, we're going to lose everything.
[1:07:39.280 --> 1:07:41.200]  The Infowar is worldwide.
[1:07:41.200 --> 1:07:45.440]  Tell your friends about Infowars, and let them know that Infowars doesn't print bull.
[1:07:45.440 --> 1:07:49.200]  It's real journalism and news, backed up by documented fact.
[1:07:49.200 --> 1:07:56.400]  Step up and take your friends and family to infowars.com, prisonplanet.tv, and planetinfowars.com.
[1:07:56.400 --> 1:08:02.080]  The truth will set them free.
[1:08:02.080 --> 1:08:08.640]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[1:08:08.640 --> 1:08:19.440]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:08:19.440 --> 1:08:25.440]  We are witnessing total and complete lawlessness by the federal government.
[1:08:25.440 --> 1:08:28.440]  We've had her set up for a week, she's launching another big initiative.
[1:08:28.440 --> 1:08:37.280]  Last time she did it with Subway, they took the plastic additive out of their bread.
[1:08:37.280 --> 1:08:41.720]  Now a lot of other fast food places haven't done it, but she targeted Subway, they took
[1:08:41.720 --> 1:08:42.720]  it out.
[1:08:42.720 --> 1:08:47.800]  They said, we'll do it within two months, and then two months later, it's now out.
[1:08:47.800 --> 1:08:48.800]  That's great.
[1:08:48.800 --> 1:08:51.000]  I'd love to be able, when I'm out on the road, there's no really good food anywhere.
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:52.000]  You might be able to find a Subway.
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:55.560]  I'd like people to go to Subway and not eat the food and not get a headache an hour later.
[1:08:55.560 --> 1:08:56.800]  A hangover.
[1:08:56.800 --> 1:09:03.160]  There's the headline, Subway to Remove Dough Conditioner, Chemical from Bread.
[1:09:03.160 --> 1:09:08.200]  So there's an example, and she launched that on our show a few months ago and other shows,
[1:09:08.200 --> 1:09:10.080]  but it was launched here and it was successful.
[1:09:10.080 --> 1:09:14.800]  So in the midst of all this evil, we're just here showing you the power of the people.
[1:09:14.800 --> 1:09:20.840]  The beer companies, the big ones are putting some really bad stuff in the beer.
[1:09:20.840 --> 1:09:24.280]  And the way she does this is we can all learn from it, because it's true, you target one
[1:09:24.280 --> 1:09:30.880]  company and then that gets their attention, and then the whole industry has to change
[1:09:30.880 --> 1:09:31.880]  when one does it.
[1:09:31.880 --> 1:09:37.760]  If you just say, oh, the fast food industry is using these emulsifiers for fluffing in
[1:09:37.760 --> 1:09:44.320]  the bread and to make it last longer, that's a plastic precursor, really bad for you.
[1:09:44.320 --> 1:09:52.040]  Also associated with infertility, no-dub.
[1:09:52.040 --> 1:09:54.880]  That is such a cheesy A saying, no-dub.
[1:09:54.880 --> 1:09:55.880]  I just say that.
[1:09:55.880 --> 1:10:01.000]  I thought it was cheesy when I was in fifth grade or sixth grade.
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:05.160]  The whole point here, ladies and gentlemen, is that we can affect things by voting with
[1:10:05.160 --> 1:10:12.120]  our dollars, voting with our euros, voting with our yen, our yen.
[1:10:12.120 --> 1:10:20.480]  And if we change the way we live, even slowly, it will be so fulfilling each little step
[1:10:20.480 --> 1:10:22.840]  we take that we'll want to take more and more steps, and that's what I've done with
[1:10:22.840 --> 1:10:25.480]  myself, losing 50 plus pounds.
[1:10:25.480 --> 1:10:30.320]  I mean, I got big, folks, 279 pounds.
[1:10:30.320 --> 1:10:33.320]  I'm down to, like, 225 pounds.
[1:10:33.320 --> 1:10:39.200]  I intend to lose another 25 pounds, but I can stand in front of the mirror now and barely
[1:10:39.200 --> 1:10:41.760]  have a little pot belly when I'm standing up, it's not even there.
[1:10:41.760 --> 1:10:47.600]  I mean, it is less than a third of the size it was, and it's with the same moderate exercise
[1:10:47.600 --> 1:10:51.640]  and with trying to eat organic and not eating any junk and not overeating and taking the
[1:10:51.640 --> 1:10:52.640]  right supplements.
[1:10:52.640 --> 1:10:57.280]  And it's just, I could still work, I could still play hard, I can do everything, and
[1:10:57.280 --> 1:11:00.600]  it's just been incremental, and I've done it, it's taken a couple of years, and I intend
[1:11:00.600 --> 1:11:03.320]  to go all the way.
[1:11:03.320 --> 1:11:08.080]  Slow and easy wins the race, so don't think it's insurmountable being out of shape or
[1:11:08.080 --> 1:11:09.080]  whatever.
[1:11:09.080 --> 1:11:13.880]  I mean, Ted Anderson, and then I'm going to get into the massive news, and our guest
[1:11:13.880 --> 1:11:18.360]  is joining us, and I hate to tell the story, but he says, no, please tell it, I want to
[1:11:18.360 --> 1:11:19.360]  help other people.
[1:11:19.360 --> 1:11:25.040]  Ted Anderson, I've known for 19 years, worked for him for 17 years, and he owns the radio
[1:11:25.040 --> 1:11:30.880]  network I'm on, so I guess I worked for him in that capacity through that deal.
[1:11:30.880 --> 1:11:34.160]  And I've met his folks four up at the office up there, it's some beautiful right between
[1:11:34.160 --> 1:11:38.160]  Minneapolis and St. Paul.
[1:11:38.160 --> 1:11:43.640]  And his dad couldn't go fishing anymore, couldn't go hunting, didn't know who he was, so he
[1:11:43.640 --> 1:11:48.240]  got him on Beyond Tangy Tangerine, this is just, I didn't mean to plug something, but
[1:11:48.240 --> 1:11:51.320]  the truth also helps fund us somehow as well while I tell the story, just an example of
[1:11:51.320 --> 1:11:58.680]  health, Beyond Tangy Tangerine 2.0, totally organic, available at m4warslife.com or m4warsteam.com,
[1:11:58.680 --> 1:12:08.720]  discounted, you can get free shipping when you sign up for auto ship.
[1:12:08.720 --> 1:12:14.960]  And his dad, after two months on Beyond Tangy Tangerine, the 90 essential vitamins and minerals
[1:12:14.960 --> 1:12:19.040]  and trace elements, the government only says you need, you know, 60 or something, it's
[1:12:19.040 --> 1:12:23.480]  actually 90 for it all to work together.
[1:12:23.480 --> 1:12:28.480]  And his dad went on it and he's told the testimony and his dad knew he was again, had a short
[1:12:28.480 --> 1:12:32.520]  term and long term memory back and basically wasn't even senile.
[1:12:32.520 --> 1:12:36.480]  It was just, but his doctor tested his blood and said, we got you on Kimmet and even though
[1:12:36.480 --> 1:12:43.640]  you've never had a stroke or heart attack, and what do you want to have vitamin K in
[1:12:43.640 --> 1:12:44.640]  your blood?
[1:12:44.640 --> 1:12:46.360]  I've told you, don't eat spinach and stuff.
[1:12:46.360 --> 1:12:52.800]  He goes, I take this stuff, my son gives me, I got to get Ted on with an update on this
[1:12:52.800 --> 1:12:58.160]  and within a month of being off Beyond Tangy Tangerine, he used to have open sores on his
[1:12:58.160 --> 1:13:02.120]  arms like some people have, that's scurvy, your body falling apart because it's not absorbing
[1:13:02.120 --> 1:13:03.120]  vitamin C anymore.
[1:13:03.120 --> 1:13:04.960]  You need it in liquid high dosages.
[1:13:04.960 --> 1:13:08.240]  That's all the medical research, Linus Pauling got a Nobel Prize for it.
[1:13:08.240 --> 1:13:10.960]  His dad basically had scurvy folks.
[1:13:10.960 --> 1:13:15.400]  Don't eat these green vegetables because that'll do stuff to your blood along because you're
[1:13:15.400 --> 1:13:19.480]  already on Cumin and we send your blood with this, so don't have vitamin K because it thins
[1:13:19.480 --> 1:13:20.600]  your blood naturally.
[1:13:20.600 --> 1:13:21.600]  What?
[1:13:21.600 --> 1:13:23.880]  Take the drug, but not the natural thing.
[1:13:23.880 --> 1:13:31.040]  Don't eat spinach, take a blood thinner, but now you can't have spinach because you
[1:13:31.040 --> 1:13:36.760]  take the blood thinner and within a month his dad didn't know who he was again.
[1:13:36.760 --> 1:13:37.760]  That was like a year ago.
[1:13:37.760 --> 1:13:38.760]  I hate to even ask.
[1:13:38.760 --> 1:13:39.920]  Let's set Ted up in the next few days.
[1:13:39.920 --> 1:13:46.800]  If you'll come on and talk about it, I mean, it's just wild and his mom said, no, we'll
[1:13:46.800 --> 1:13:52.480]  do what the doctor says because it's like a high priest.

[1:14:22.720 --> 1:14:23.720]  Plus and more.
[1:14:23.720 --> 1:14:24.720]  Okay, I'm going to stop right there.
[1:14:24.720 --> 1:14:25.720]  I didn't mean to do that plug.
[1:14:25.720 --> 1:14:29.560]  I was talking about getting emulsifiers out of the bread, McDonald's still has it in
[1:14:29.560 --> 1:14:31.640]  their chicken McNuggets.
[1:14:31.640 --> 1:14:40.400]  It's the precursor of silicon and it's literally like taking your kids to Moloch and sacrificing
[1:14:40.400 --> 1:14:51.160]  them to the fiery altar, but instead you sacrifice your dad, it's sacrificed to the doctor.
[1:14:51.160 --> 1:14:54.320]  What's this vitamin K's up in your blood?
[1:14:54.320 --> 1:14:57.440]  Well, you told you, are you eating green vegetables?
[1:14:57.440 --> 1:15:00.040]  I told you not to.
[1:15:00.040 --> 1:15:01.840]  You're on blood thinner.
[1:15:01.840 --> 1:15:06.840]  Yeah, don't thin your blood with the vegetable naturally.
[1:15:06.840 --> 1:15:18.000]  I mean, it's so crazy, glyphosates cause on record estrogen-related tumors to grow.
[1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:21.480]  That's mainline literature for 20 years.
[1:15:21.480 --> 1:15:29.840]  They make movies about it with George Clooney and still they say, why is breast cancer exploding,
[1:15:29.840 --> 1:15:33.960]  and you look at countries that introduced Roundup, suddenly their breast cancer goes
[1:15:33.960 --> 1:15:40.880]  off the chart, their pancreatic cancer goes off the chart, their prostate cancer goes
[1:15:40.880 --> 1:15:44.680]  off the chart, and everybody just keeps saying, give more money, pink, pink, I'll be at a
[1:15:44.680 --> 1:15:48.280]  restaurant, I'll be at the store buying something, buying a water hose, you know, would you like
[1:15:48.280 --> 1:15:54.640]  to give 10% of your bill extra for the breast cancer, I'll be at a restaurant, would you
[1:15:54.640 --> 1:16:01.880]  like a pink martini for women's breast cancer, no, don't look at you unapprovingly, why don't
[1:16:01.880 --> 1:16:02.880]  you care?
[1:16:02.880 --> 1:16:07.200]  It's all this guilt culture using our goodwill and I'll start giving them a speech, I'll
[1:16:07.200 --> 1:16:12.560]  go, you know the weed killer is the main cause of the increase of breast cancer, you know
[1:16:12.560 --> 1:16:17.520]  I've got daughters and a mother and a grandmother and a wife and all these people that I don't
[1:16:17.520 --> 1:16:23.240]  want to die or have their breasts chopped off, don't act like I don't care with your
[1:16:23.240 --> 1:16:29.040]  fake guilt which you've been programmed to shovel on me, I'm called a terrorist and an
[1:16:29.040 --> 1:16:39.520]  extremist because I talk about it, Monsanto has settled for decades of dumping dioxin
[1:16:39.520 --> 1:16:49.040]  directly into creeks in a whole subsections of Aniston, Alabama running directly into
[1:16:49.040 --> 1:16:58.840]  the blacks well water and then the numbers are just off the chart, basically everybody
[1:16:58.840 --> 1:17:06.720]  dies of cancer and they knew and they just dumped it right into the water, after all
[1:17:06.720 --> 1:17:13.240]  it's just a bunch of black people, do you know how evil Monsanto is ladies and gentlemen,
[1:17:13.240 --> 1:17:28.240]  their own engineers, CBC, BBC report in 1999, their own people will not eat GMO at their
[1:17:28.240 --> 1:17:39.400]  laboratory cafeterias, these people are crazy, they don't care the nuclear reactors are leaking
[1:17:39.400 --> 1:17:49.200]  all over the country now, no one cares about, they're nuts, let me tell you something, if
[1:17:49.200 --> 1:17:54.800]  Obama tries a gun registration and they start swatting people that won't register or they
[1:17:54.800 --> 1:17:59.600]  start witch hunts like they're already doing, it's going to cause the patriots to fight
[1:17:59.600 --> 1:18:04.520]  back and then you will have them build Godowners as terrorists and folks were off of the races
[1:18:04.520 --> 1:18:09.480]  and this is the false flag, the civil war is the false flag, they know that the patriots
[1:18:09.480 --> 1:18:15.560]  are going to completely annihilate the police and military long term and they know the military
[1:18:15.560 --> 1:18:19.360]  is going to go to a fortress mentality, take over the cities and they got martial law right
[1:18:19.360 --> 1:18:24.480]  there shutting off the rural communities, here's Obama one more time, Obama claims gun
[1:18:24.480 --> 1:18:42.720]  violence off the charts, my biggest frustration so far is the fact that this society has not
[1:18:42.720 --> 1:18:59.200]  been willing to take some basic steps to keep guns out of the hands of people who can do
[1:18:59.200 --> 1:19:07.240]  just unbelievable damage, we're the only developed country on earth where this happens and it
[1:19:07.240 --> 1:19:16.920]  happens now once a week and it's a one day story, there's no place else like this, couple
[1:19:16.920 --> 1:19:28.400]  of decades ago Australia had a mass shooting similar to Columbine or Newtown and Australia
[1:19:28.400 --> 1:19:37.080]  just said well that's it, we're not doing, we're not seeing that again and basically
[1:19:37.080 --> 1:19:46.680]  imposed very severe, tough gun laws and they haven't had a mass shooting since, our levels
[1:19:46.680 --> 1:19:52.920]  of gun violence are off the charts, there's no advanced developed country on earth that
[1:19:52.920 --> 1:19:59.920]  would put up with this, how do you analyze, I'm skipping the network break, how do you
[1:19:59.920 --> 1:20:08.120]  analyze a one minute clip of pure lies like that, people aren't buying it bud because
[1:20:08.120 --> 1:20:14.960]  the mainstream media is dead, Nietzsche was wrong, God ain't dead, the mainstream media
[1:20:14.960 --> 1:20:22.560]  is just like the Tyrannosaurus Rex, it's dead and you just hadn't figured it out yet, they
[1:20:22.560 --> 1:20:26.440]  actually the Pentagon came out and it did admit it, they're running CISI ops now, they're
[1:20:26.440 --> 1:20:30.160]  desperate and they understand they're done, they want to bring an internet censorship,
[1:20:30.160 --> 1:20:35.760]  that's their new big game plan.
[1:20:35.760 --> 1:20:39.320]  But they banned everything down to single shots and you've got to have a license for
[1:20:39.320 --> 1:20:45.080]  that in rural areas and they basically have banned, you name it, crime has exploded in
[1:20:45.080 --> 1:20:49.400]  Australian cities, mugging, stabbing just like they have in England, their crime rates
[1:20:49.400 --> 1:20:55.840]  up over tenfold, look it up, you are five times more likely anywhere in England, you
[1:20:55.840 --> 1:21:00.400]  can look these numbers up to be mugged than you are in the United States, London is more
[1:21:00.400 --> 1:21:05.720]  dangerous than Chicago to be mugged, stabbed, beat over the head, killed, raped, if you
[1:21:05.720 --> 1:21:08.920]  fight back they prosecute you, I mean that's famous, they're trying to ban butcher knives
[1:21:08.920 --> 1:21:17.200]  now in England and the rest of the UK, Switzerland everyone has to own guns by law and they have
[1:21:17.200 --> 1:21:21.280]  grenade launchers at local caches in case the country ever gets overrun for the citizens
[1:21:21.280 --> 1:21:24.560]  to get and no one's shooting or having grenade attacks, they have the lowest crime rate in
[1:21:24.560 --> 1:21:26.440]  the world.
[1:21:26.440 --> 1:21:32.440]  Now mugging is worse in London than in Harlem, London Daily Mail, see, told you, I told you
[1:21:32.440 --> 1:21:36.400]  about Aniston, Alabama and they pulled up the articles and the statistics and the settlements,
[1:21:36.400 --> 1:21:40.480]  I mean I'm not making any of this up, if you're a TV viewer you can see them in live time,
[1:21:40.480 --> 1:21:44.240]  this is not scripted, they search engine, everything I say and there it is, okay, I
[1:21:44.240 --> 1:21:49.140]  mean I don't make stuff up, okay, I don't have time to go in and tell you how the Port
[1:21:49.140 --> 1:21:54.560]  Arthur massacre was totally staged with a mind control wind up toy, multiple shooters
[1:21:54.560 --> 1:22:02.080]  whole nine yards, I mean Anderson Cooper's been standing at the CNN center saying he's
[1:22:02.080 --> 1:22:09.120]  in Sandy Hook and his nose disappears, it's blue screen, I don't know what went on there
[1:22:09.120 --> 1:22:14.680]  but it's fake and top school security people that have run major universities and been
[1:22:14.680 --> 1:22:18.560]  national, you know, been on Nightline and Good Morning America have come out and said
[1:22:18.560 --> 1:22:24.560]  it's fake.
[1:22:24.560 --> 1:22:30.640]  Wolfgang Halbig and he has feds and you name it, come to this house and say stop investigating,
[1:22:30.640 --> 1:22:41.200]  you better watch it, why would they want him to stop investigating if he's a cook, no
[1:22:41.200 --> 1:22:45.200]  he's a German who immigrated here as a child and came in America and loves his country
[1:22:45.200 --> 1:22:53.400]  and he's an American, he's not a coward, that's who Wolfgang Halbig is, just a man and they're
[1:22:53.400 --> 1:22:57.280]  scared and they should be because listen there's a million Wolfgang Halbig's coming, there's
[1:22:57.280 --> 1:23:03.240]  a million Alex Jones' coming, there's a million Jakari Jackson's coming, there's a million
[1:23:03.240 --> 1:23:09.120]  Telly Blackwood's coming, there's a million Adon Salazar's coming, there's a million
[1:23:09.120 --> 1:23:13.880]  Paul Watson's coming and Eon Watson's, you're not going to stop us, we want freedom, it's
[1:23:13.880 --> 1:23:18.160]  what we're meant to have, you've got to drive our humanity out of us and make us have a
[1:23:18.160 --> 1:23:23.160]  death wish so that we give up and don't care about ourselves and don't have any faith
[1:23:23.160 --> 1:23:28.640]  in ourselves, I mean here's the man who runs Chicago, the murder capital of the world,
[1:23:28.640 --> 1:23:33.840]  the murder capital country is Mexico, highest number of murders, look it up, in the world
[1:23:33.840 --> 1:23:40.200]  seven years running Mexico, but there's no city in Mexico that has upwards of 15 gun
[1:23:40.200 --> 1:23:49.880]  deaths a week and 30 plus shootings per weekend like Chicago year round and again it's the
[1:23:49.880 --> 1:23:55.320]  poor controlled sectors of Chicago that run by the democratic mafia that have the high
[1:23:55.320 --> 1:24:00.040]  crime, you go to places right next door or suburbs where they have guns, the crime rate
[1:24:00.040 --> 1:24:05.240]  goes to some of the lowest in the country, where you have welfare and the government
[1:24:05.240 --> 1:24:11.440]  system in Chicago, it'll be hell on earth and a mile away low crime rate because there's
[1:24:11.440 --> 1:24:19.080]  law abiding people, good people there and they have guns illegally and five years ago
[1:24:19.080 --> 1:24:22.080]  the Supreme Court ordered them to let the citizens be armed and they've not allowed
[1:24:22.080 --> 1:24:27.240]  them to be armed in Chicago lawlessly just like they're lawlessly opening the borders
[1:24:27.240 --> 1:24:37.800]  up and the media is going jeepers creepers, lie on earth, you know are there hundreds
[1:24:37.800 --> 1:24:42.360]  of thousands of illegals a month pouring in now and military bases fall off them because
[1:24:42.360 --> 1:24:46.080]  they legalize them when they get here and give them welfare and Obama's advertised that
[1:24:46.080 --> 1:24:53.320]  and the country's collapsing there's seven million people trying to get here, no country
[1:24:53.320 --> 1:24:56.920]  in history and by the way libertarians I'm a real libertarian okay constitutionalist
[1:24:56.920 --> 1:25:02.240]  I'm going to our guest but libertarians send me emails I see you know reason and others
[1:25:02.240 --> 1:25:08.120]  go Alex Jones and people want statist borders you know but I don't thought you don't like
[1:25:08.120 --> 1:25:13.720]  the police state why do you want a border then because if we didn't have welfare in
[1:25:13.720 --> 1:25:17.880]  this country and you couldn't come here and have your baby for free that's thirty thousand
[1:25:17.880 --> 1:25:23.000]  dollars and it wasn't advertised in Mexican newspapers by US hospitals 20 years ago still
[1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:27.600]  going to the news today come here and have your baby for free put your kid on a plane
[1:25:27.600 --> 1:25:35.760]  if they get off they'll give them a lawyer they're legal you can't say oh we're going
[1:25:35.760 --> 1:25:42.440]  to be wide open and free when you're surrounded by unfree failed countries Mexico is a failed
[1:25:42.440 --> 1:25:47.400]  state you can't even go to cancun safely now the state department warning on it they can't
[1:25:47.400 --> 1:25:56.920]  even keep the rich tourist districts owned by the narcotics trafficking government safe
[1:25:56.920 --> 1:26:00.440]  and the new bureaucrat class for the military and social services is going to be illegal
[1:26:00.440 --> 1:26:03.760]  aliens that's in the washington times they're now making them police officers sheriff's
[1:26:03.760 --> 1:26:09.560]  deputies military that's the main minority force minority force it's all minorities
[1:26:09.560 --> 1:26:14.600]  by minorities white whatever it's all subgroups in the military but the largest one group
[1:26:14.600 --> 1:26:19.680]  none of our majority is illegals that were legalized in the US military this is globalism
[1:26:19.680 --> 1:26:23.920]  we're being conquered doesn't do with the fact that latinos are coming into this country
[1:26:23.920 --> 1:26:28.360]  that's the majority that's just because that's the failed third world south of us and we're
[1:26:28.360 --> 1:26:34.240]  now being failed as our power plants are turned off as the taxes are raised as a small businesses
[1:26:34.240 --> 1:26:40.760]  are shut down the plan is to implode the country but we can fight back ladies and gentlemen
[1:26:40.760 --> 1:26:44.200]  and that's why they're panicking the blue blood evil republican leadership that helped
[1:26:44.200 --> 1:26:49.240]  ride obama care is a giant scam to cheat and erase payroll taxes on poor people and set
[1:26:49.240 --> 1:26:54.560]  up death panels house majority leader canner defeated in primary by libertarian tea party
[1:26:54.560 --> 1:27:04.080]  candidate now we've got it for the balance of the hour i really appreciate her coming
[1:27:04.080 --> 1:27:07.840]  on shifting gears into a whole another subject but it's on the issue of taking action and
[1:27:07.840 --> 1:27:19.240]  winning is our guest banny harry food babe dot com you've seen all over national television
[1:27:19.240 --> 1:27:24.280]  very lovely super smart lady and she's launched a lot of initiatives the most recent was
[1:27:24.280 --> 1:27:28.900]  well i'll let her tell you about it now she's launching another one with hopefully great
[1:27:28.900 --> 1:27:33.280]  success like the other initiatives and it's a blueprint for all of us to have victory
[1:27:33.280 --> 1:27:39.280]  over our food supply our water and have the right to have access to things free from toxic
[1:27:39.280 --> 1:27:44.800]  chemicals mind and body bending systems so tell us what's coming up the next long segment
[1:27:44.800 --> 1:27:49.800]  thank you so much for coming on we salute your work thank you so much for having me
[1:27:49.800 --> 1:27:55.200]  join you know i launched the subway petition here a few months ago and one that within
[1:27:55.200 --> 1:28:00.520]  24 hours now i think this petition is going to be a longer fight because i am talking
[1:28:00.520 --> 1:28:05.960]  about secrets that have been held for decades from the beer industry the beer industry right
[1:28:05.960 --> 1:28:12.560]  now is not allowed or not required rather to disclose the ingredients in beer however
[1:28:12.560 --> 1:28:19.520]  the government allows a long list of controversial additives in beer and so this secrecy in this
[1:28:19.520 --> 1:28:26.360]  mystery has to end the fact that nobody has held these companies accountable in recent
[1:28:26.360 --> 1:28:32.600]  years i think is a big issue and i think that as you know fourth of july comes up and everybody
[1:28:32.600 --> 1:28:38.760]  goes around the the grills and starts celebrating the holiday and starts throwing back miller
[1:28:38.760 --> 1:28:44.680]  light and bud light and miller coors and anhyzer bush brands i think people need to realize
[1:28:44.680 --> 1:28:50.520]  they have no idea what they're drinking we've been blindly drinking beer and not knowing
[1:28:50.520 --> 1:28:55.160]  what these companies are putting in our beer and some of the things i found out are downright
[1:28:55.160 --> 1:28:59.920]  shocking well they use it for social control and anhyzer bush isn't even beer for about
[1:28:59.920 --> 1:29:04.520]  15 years it's actually a chemical syrup so folks need to understand the reason i don't
[1:29:04.520 --> 1:29:09.240]  ever drink american beer now unless from a micro brewery is because it's not beer you
[1:29:09.240 --> 1:29:14.480]  drink german or mexican because they follow the old brewmaster things of england and germanic
[1:29:14.480 --> 1:29:17.760]  and so i'm sure you're the big expert tell us about when we come back but this is the
[1:29:17.760 --> 1:29:23.480]  secrets of beer would you call it the beer conspiracy or fake beer conspiracy i think
[1:29:23.480 --> 1:29:30.520]  it's like the big beer cover up you know the big beer cover up bingo we're drinking in

[1:34:20.520 --> 1:34:25.800]  with chick filet craft whole foods linked was in mcdonald's general mills coca-cola
[1:34:25.800 --> 1:34:32.200]  chipotle and many others i mean this is really a good tactic you're using how did you learn and
[1:34:32.200 --> 1:34:39.880]  develop all this and then let's get into the secrets of beer yeah so you know i was like a sick
[1:34:39.880 --> 1:34:45.000]  child growing up my whole life you know my parents have come here from india didn't know how to cook
[1:34:45.000 --> 1:34:50.280]  american food and they wanted me to fit in like everybody else so what did we do we bought the
[1:34:50.280 --> 1:34:56.920]  package processed goods at the grocery store that are full of corn and soy and no nutritional value
[1:34:56.920 --> 1:35:02.440]  we ate mcdonald's for lunch for dinner for breakfast i mean i don't i don't know how many
[1:35:02.440 --> 1:35:07.800]  father's days um we went to mcdonald's for their free breakfast i don't know if they still do that
[1:35:07.800 --> 1:35:12.200]  or not but we used to go every single year growing up and if father's day is coming up
[1:35:12.200 --> 1:35:16.440]  and it just reminds me of that time period where you know if you do like a little coloring for
[1:35:16.440 --> 1:35:21.880]  your dad you get a free you know totally sick ploy like crack dealers trying to give crack to 10
[1:35:21.880 --> 1:35:27.720]  year olds at the playground exactly and you know i grew up that way and it was so detrimental to
[1:35:27.720 --> 1:35:35.480]  my health i um suffered asthma eczema as a child never felt well always had stomach aches you know
[1:35:35.480 --> 1:35:42.520]  and then when i graduated college and got into the real world and started living this rat race uh
[1:35:42.520 --> 1:35:48.200]  environment working for a big six consulting firm in a cubicle traveling being on their expense
[1:35:48.200 --> 1:35:52.200]  account eating what everybody else was eating around me instead of controlling my own food and
[1:35:52.200 --> 1:35:58.040]  controlling my own destiny i became really overweight i became very sick very quickly
[1:35:58.040 --> 1:36:03.560]  and i had to have you know an organ taken out of my body oh my god and doctors will tell you oh
[1:36:03.560 --> 1:36:09.640]  appendicitis is very random it can happen to anybody but i don't believe that you know appendicitis
[1:36:09.640 --> 1:36:14.200]  happens when your stomach is inflamed from all the stuff that you've been eating or treating your
[1:36:14.200 --> 1:36:21.480]  body with and unfortunately a lot of people are are eating these these new industrial food like
[1:36:21.480 --> 1:36:27.320]  substances that are causing this inflammation and i definitely was a victim of that and so i
[1:36:27.320 --> 1:36:34.280]  decided in that hospital room back in december that of 2002 over 10 years ago now that i would
[1:36:34.280 --> 1:36:39.800]  take control of my own health i would figure out what's in food how to eat the best food possible
[1:36:39.800 --> 1:36:44.040]  and what i found out was shocking not only did i find out that majority of our food is made with
[1:36:44.040 --> 1:36:49.720]  genetically engineered ingredients never tested long-term on humans but i found out that all of
[1:36:49.720 --> 1:36:54.920]  these substances that are really cheap for the food industry to use are pumped into all of our food
[1:36:54.920 --> 1:37:01.960]  and so i started to reject that i said no more corn no more soy none of this gmo stuff i'm gonna
[1:37:01.960 --> 1:37:07.880]  eat organic food i'm gonna start going to farmers markets i'm gonna find out what these chemicals
[1:37:07.880 --> 1:37:13.480]  mean on the back of packages and when i found out that things like yoga mat material are in there
[1:37:13.480 --> 1:37:20.280]  and things like high fructose corn syrup that you know they find mercury in and and how like there's
[1:37:20.280 --> 1:37:26.760]  all of these different additives that are used to create addiction to food like hidden msg i knew i
[1:37:26.760 --> 1:37:32.200]  didn't need to eat that anymore and so i shunned all of those brands and companies long ago and when
[1:37:32.200 --> 1:37:38.520]  i did that something remarkable happened not only did i lose weight but i've been able to maintain a
[1:37:38.520 --> 1:37:45.640]  nice figure for a really long time doing nothing but eating real food and also all of my health
[1:37:45.640 --> 1:37:51.720]  issues as a child and as an adult magically went away alex i'm talking about being on six to eight
[1:37:51.720 --> 1:37:58.280]  prescription drugs depending upon the season to being on zero today being 10 years older and having
[1:37:58.280 --> 1:38:05.240]  less drugs as as a 10 years older and having more energy 10 years older than i did 10 years ago um
[1:38:05.240 --> 1:38:11.400]  when i started figuring this stuff out and when i did this everyone around me my friends my family
[1:38:11.400 --> 1:38:16.600]  members they wanted to know the secrets and so i started to tell them what i learned and they were
[1:38:16.600 --> 1:38:20.920]  shocked they were downright they couldn't believe the information i was giving them on a day to
[1:38:20.920 --> 1:38:25.640]  day basis as i was traveling with them you know whether it be co-workers or with friends or family
[1:38:25.640 --> 1:38:30.200]  or at my mom's house the truth is they've grandfathered for a hundred years i know you're
[1:38:30.200 --> 1:38:33.720]  an expert on this but we've had other experts on to speak about this i don't get into beer
[1:38:33.720 --> 1:38:40.600]  to be able to basically put drugs in the food the additives are toxic many poisons are addictive
[1:38:40.600 --> 1:38:46.360]  aspartame you name it msg they are getting you trained to eat their processed food and then they
[1:38:46.360 --> 1:38:50.680]  have just like the tobacco companies adding all these other chemicals to make it more addictive
[1:38:50.680 --> 1:38:56.120]  it's just like tobacco companies but with food and and and and i've read the you know the books
[1:38:56.120 --> 1:39:00.200]  the documents we've covered it where they brag about that i mean as you know colonel sanders make
[1:39:00.200 --> 1:39:05.480]  Kentucky fried chicken takeover because he found out the japanese military couldn't get japanese
[1:39:05.480 --> 1:39:09.640]  back in world war one to eat the cruddy canned food because japanese like good fresh seafood
[1:39:09.640 --> 1:39:14.360]  so they learned to put msg in it it's totally toxic and tricks the brain he brought that here in
[1:39:14.360 --> 1:39:20.040]  the 20s the next is history there's thousands of things they're doing and and here you are
[1:39:20.040 --> 1:39:27.240]  exposing it let's let's start getting into beer the the the big beer conspiracy you know you know
[1:39:27.240 --> 1:39:32.120]  because i care about the ingredients i buy and i bring in my home and you can see my refrigerator
[1:39:32.120 --> 1:39:39.240]  back behind me um the one thing i didn't know what was in my fridge because i have a husband and he
[1:39:39.240 --> 1:39:45.480]  loves beer was beer like i would look at the label and i knew nothing about it and i couldn't believe
[1:39:45.480 --> 1:39:50.200]  that i knew nothing about it and so i started to ask questions about a year and a half ago
[1:39:50.200 --> 1:39:56.040]  i started an investigation and i started asking the beer manufacturer questions about what's actually
[1:39:56.040 --> 1:40:01.240]  in their beer what ingredients are allowed in beer and when i found this book published called
[1:40:01.240 --> 1:40:07.320]  chemical additives in beer it's actually out of publishing it's it was in 1982 that it was released
[1:40:07.320 --> 1:40:13.400]  so it was so old but it had this list of additives that are allowed in beer things like msg things
[1:40:13.400 --> 1:40:18.440]  like carcinogen which is linked to intestinal information high fructose corn syrup caramel
[1:40:18.440 --> 1:40:23.160]  coloring level four which is considered a carcinogen in the state of california the fruit is they
[1:40:23.160 --> 1:40:29.080]  but budweiser especially and it's just beer flavoring sugar and some alcohol they scored in it a
[1:40:29.080 --> 1:40:33.240]  lot of these companies aren't even doing fermentation now it's not beer and they're not even using real
[1:40:33.240 --> 1:40:38.440]  hops either one thing i found out that miller coors has patents on this thing called tetrahops
[1:40:38.440 --> 1:40:44.440]  it's a hop extract so it's the the minimum amount of hops they can possibly use in beer and so like
[1:40:44.440 --> 1:40:49.240]  a lot they're actually health benefits to eating hops but they actually take all those out when they
[1:40:49.240 --> 1:40:55.160]  start using these extracts and so there's all of this mystery behind what people are drinking and
[1:40:55.160 --> 1:41:01.240]  people around the world it's not just americans people around the world are blindly drinking beer
[1:41:01.240 --> 1:41:07.800]  and so i wanted to start a petition i launched it this morning at foodbabe.com slash beer and over
[1:41:07.800 --> 1:41:15.320]  11 000 people have already signed it in less than three hours this is a big huge issue and i'm opening
[1:41:15.320 --> 1:41:21.160]  up pandora's box for these beer companies it's a hundred billion dollar industry and i'm scared to
[1:41:21.160 --> 1:41:26.440]  death right now you have to have a lot of courage to go up against the beer industry but someone has
[1:41:26.440 --> 1:41:33.960]  to do it we have to stop this lack of transparency we have to increase the amount of information
[1:41:33.960 --> 1:41:39.160]  consumers have so they can say you know what bud light lime has high fructose corn syrup i'm not
[1:41:39.160 --> 1:41:43.240]  going to buy that anymore i'm going to go to this craft brewer or i'm going to go to this organic
[1:41:43.240 --> 1:41:48.600]  brewer and get something of quality to bring it into my home and feed to my husband and by the way
[1:41:49.720 --> 1:41:54.760]  as we know the micro brewers everywhere are now displacing because people drink it and go wow this
[1:41:54.760 --> 1:42:00.200]  is beer versus the toxic stuff that people are trained on so beer drinkers have to get their
[1:42:00.200 --> 1:42:06.200]  friends off of the bad stuff and just like you go to target now five years ago all the ketchup you
[1:42:06.200 --> 1:42:12.920]  know i had fructose corn syrup in it it had all the bad stuff now it openly you know says organic
[1:42:12.920 --> 1:42:17.960]  so it's across the board we were getting the bpa out of the plastic i think this is going to be even
[1:42:17.960 --> 1:42:23.960]  more explosive than your past operations and i think we're going to force the big beer manufacturers
[1:42:23.960 --> 1:42:27.640]  to actually produce beer because the corporate chiefs don't want to actually have to have brew
[1:42:27.640 --> 1:42:31.560]  masters there and actually have to create good tasting beer they want to just put a bunch of
[1:42:31.560 --> 1:42:36.200]  fake syrup together that tastes like beer and beer flavoring you know we want real root beer
[1:42:36.200 --> 1:42:40.920]  with real sasperilla we want real beer that actually you know is organic and grows well
[1:42:40.920 --> 1:42:46.040]  that's why they're losing such a market share i saw the number that they've lost like 45 percent
[1:42:46.040 --> 1:42:50.600]  saw in the wall street journal last year in the us of their market to micro and local
[1:42:50.600 --> 1:42:56.200]  beers the way that counters try to buy them up but but you know no why don't people realize
[1:42:56.200 --> 1:43:01.800]  those micro brews taste better than the watered down sugary stuff that they're selling us uh
[1:43:01.800 --> 1:43:06.840]  in the typical most popular beers which is it's really sad that you know the most popular beers
[1:43:06.840 --> 1:43:11.400]  still continue to be bud light and other light and it's because it's cheap and people need to realize
[1:43:11.400 --> 1:43:15.800]  that because something cheap is cheap doesn't mean it's good and good for you but they they have
[1:43:15.800 --> 1:43:20.200]  such a huge marketing machine i mean just think about all the super bowl ads and everything else
[1:43:20.200 --> 1:43:26.040]  that they do on a normal basis to brainwash you into wanting these brands as americans
[1:43:26.040 --> 1:43:31.160]  and even even people overseas you know i don't know how many times i've traveled alex and i
[1:43:31.160 --> 1:43:35.480]  come across someone that's from another country and they think it's cool to drink bud wiser and
[1:43:35.480 --> 1:43:40.200]  i'm like no you need to be drinking the beer no it's crazy i see that all the mexican immigrants
[1:43:40.200 --> 1:43:46.360]  up here and they're all getting miller light and bud wiser and i'm like my god this mexican beer
[1:43:46.360 --> 1:43:52.440]  tastes light years better than than the fake new old water beer but that's what they want
[1:43:52.440 --> 1:43:56.760]  and then it gives you diabetes yeah one of the things i want to mention you met you mentioned
[1:43:56.760 --> 1:44:02.680]  mexico beer well corona was actually acquired by one of these big companies and now they're
[1:44:02.680 --> 1:44:09.480]  using propylene glycol something found in airplane de icing liquid in corona so be aware of incredible
[1:44:09.480 --> 1:44:15.480]  i don't like corona i used to taste good uh when i was in high school and now it hadn't tasted good
[1:44:15.480 --> 1:44:20.440]  in a long time i don't drink a lot of beer i don't drink a lot anymore but uh you know bottom line is
[1:44:20.440 --> 1:44:26.440]  that i gotta tell you i think you know alex i think the most interesting part of this story
[1:44:26.440 --> 1:44:34.360]  is that right now the fda does not regulate beer the treasury department who controls our taxes
[1:44:34.360 --> 1:44:39.800]  is regulating one of the world's most popular drinks i mean it's third after water and soda yeah
[1:44:39.800 --> 1:44:44.760]  where's the fda when they're harassing people that sell vitamin c pills and shutting them down
[1:44:44.760 --> 1:44:50.200]  but then meanwhile because the nfl's tax exempt these big beer companies they're all left alone
[1:44:50.200 --> 1:44:57.640]  because they're part of the control system yeah and it's it's it's really uh very uh shameful
[1:44:57.640 --> 1:45:02.200]  that the government has allowed this to happen this long and i hope people support the petition
[1:45:02.200 --> 1:45:07.320]  because i think if we can get millions of things i really think this petition if the if the companies
[1:45:07.320 --> 1:45:13.080]  don't act soon enough i think this petition has the as the you know will be bigger than subway
[1:45:13.080 --> 1:45:18.360]  in the respect that you know in my other past efforts because it's a global issue and it's
[1:45:18.360 --> 1:45:23.800]  something that's been you know a cloaked in secrecy for so long and i hope you don't we need don't we
[1:45:23.800 --> 1:45:30.600]  need german beer purity laws that they've had for 500 years that meant because this nothing's new
[1:45:30.600 --> 1:45:36.040]  under the sun there's been scams going on i mean look at the jungle what is it t s elliott the i
[1:45:36.040 --> 1:45:41.160]  believe the true story about the rockefellers will put chalk in the milk just like they do in china
[1:45:41.160 --> 1:45:46.520]  or melamine and and then babies would die these scams have been going on forever and and and there
[1:45:46.520 --> 1:45:51.960]  should be state laws i think that if you false advertise and call something beer and it's not
[1:45:51.960 --> 1:45:57.480]  you know you ought to get shut down i mean i'm sick of it it's a fraud yeah it's an absolute fraud
[1:45:57.480 --> 1:46:02.200]  i mean the fact that high fructose corn syrup has any place in beer is just ludicrous that
[1:46:02.200 --> 1:46:06.040]  caramel coloring because they want to put caramel coloring in it because they don't want to spend
[1:46:06.040 --> 1:46:11.560]  the money on the right type of malt and the right type of hops is is a is a problem i've been so
[1:46:11.560 --> 1:46:16.920]  clear sorry they're getting away with using these really cheap additives in calling it beer is a
[1:46:16.920 --> 1:46:22.520]  problem and that's why i think this transparency is so important now if you sign the petition at
[1:46:22.520 --> 1:46:28.840]  foodbape.com slash beer alex i actually have a link to some beer approved like approved food
[1:46:28.840 --> 1:46:33.080]  behavior proved beers if you will that have actually released your ingredients we're starting
[1:46:33.080 --> 1:46:39.400]  to catalog beer manufacturers that are up front about their ingredients and up front about all of
[1:46:39.400 --> 1:46:47.240]  their processing aids like ice and glass which is a fish swim bladder and carrageena and that can
[1:46:47.240 --> 1:46:55.640]  disrupt the intestinal tract well i'll say it bottom line the bread and circus gladiatorial
[1:46:55.640 --> 1:47:03.640]  events sports beer it's all being used to control the population and we need to get it to where it's
[1:47:03.640 --> 1:47:09.320]  unadulterated even if you're not a drinker folks you should not want fake beer being sold everywhere
[1:47:09.320 --> 1:47:14.280]  and these companies getting away with it and this is a revolution because this is pure americana
[1:47:14.280 --> 1:47:19.160]  libertarian that the food babe is talking about where we vote with our dollars and we vote by the
[1:47:19.160 --> 1:47:23.880]  decisions we make in our life this is the type of thing from the second amendment right through
[1:47:23.880 --> 1:47:29.720]  to national sovereignty right through to globalism take your money away from the big establishment
[1:47:29.720 --> 1:47:34.200]  companies that's why they've got initiatives to ban outdoor markets and and all over the country
[1:47:34.200 --> 1:47:39.240]  and to ban farmers markets and harass them with bureaucrats and inspectors and to ban raw milk
[1:47:39.240 --> 1:47:43.880]  when it's so safe on record compared to regular boiled down fake milk that isn't even milk it's
[1:47:43.880 --> 1:47:50.680]  like liquid cheese it's so bad for your heart uh on every front their forbs ask why is there a war
[1:47:50.680 --> 1:47:54.920]  on lemonade stands nationwide because they don't want kids getting the idea you i mean you never
[1:47:54.920 --> 1:47:58.600]  see watermelon stands because the state police go stop them and go you can't be on the side
[1:47:58.600 --> 1:48:04.680]  of the road selling watermelons i mean they're shutting down normal human activity folks and
[1:48:04.680 --> 1:48:10.440]  creating a synthetic artificial consciousness is what i would call it yeah you know the fact that
[1:48:10.440 --> 1:48:17.400]  we know more about what's in windex and coca-cola than we do about beer just says it all like it
[1:48:17.400 --> 1:48:24.840]  just says it all that you know that basically no one's out there safeguarding our food supply
[1:48:24.840 --> 1:48:28.680]  our drink supply they're they're not looking out for a better number the freak out last year when
[1:48:28.680 --> 1:48:35.720]  we learned that something like 70 percent of the fish uh isn't even fish and it's fake uh and the
[1:48:35.720 --> 1:48:41.400]  whole pink slime thing a few years before that what i'm saying here is this from what i've read
[1:48:41.400 --> 1:48:45.960]  and what i knew years ago but you're quantifying it and really stating how incredible it is and
[1:48:45.960 --> 1:48:50.920]  mounting an initiative against this this this fraud this is not beer when you got a bunch of
[1:48:50.920 --> 1:48:58.600]  extracts and corn syrup and beer flavor that's not beer and it's disgusting just like they put
[1:48:58.600 --> 1:49:03.400]  msg in the doritos to make you eat more they put msg in a lot of these other beers to make you drink
[1:49:03.400 --> 1:49:09.720]  too much too i mean you can't go out and drink six grolches that are you know real thick german style
[1:49:09.720 --> 1:49:14.760]  beer or holland beer but but let me tell you can drink six Budweiser's easy so it's meant to be
[1:49:14.760 --> 1:49:21.720]  gluttonous and to program the brain as well well you know i cannot wait for these secrets to be
[1:49:21.720 --> 1:49:27.720]  revealed i think these beer industry giants are going to be put under a lot of public pressure
[1:49:27.720 --> 1:49:33.480]  from not only you alex in your program here but i think the mainstream media is on this story right

[1:56:32.200 --> 1:56:38.200]  how specifically how you've been so successful and hopefully how others can duplicate pr campaigns
[1:56:38.200 --> 1:56:43.640]  for liberty that that really changed the world i mean it's a big deal and you know it's so funny
[1:56:43.640 --> 1:56:49.080]  because i've had no media or pr training or anything like that you know i was a debater in
[1:56:49.080 --> 1:56:54.280]  high school that knew how to research and so i've been able to use that those skills in order to
[1:56:54.280 --> 1:57:01.240]  research this information and so um when i started to research this and started to put it on the blog
[1:57:01.240 --> 1:57:06.440]  you know what i found out very quickly is when you tell the truth when you tell information
[1:57:06.440 --> 1:57:11.480]  that hasn't been told anywhere else that when you discover new things about how companies are
[1:57:11.480 --> 1:57:17.080]  treating people or what how they treat you when you call them or how um how there's certain things
[1:57:17.080 --> 1:57:23.640]  that you wonder about you wonder if other people are wondering about too if you make those ideas
[1:57:23.640 --> 1:57:28.520]  known in a in a in a big way whether it be you know your own facebook page on your own twitter
[1:57:28.520 --> 1:57:33.960]  account or maybe it's on your instagram like wherever where people like in the world can see this
[1:57:34.520 --> 1:57:40.200]  it has the opportunity to get shared and i think that's one of the most valuable lessons i learned
[1:57:40.200 --> 1:57:47.240]  early on was when i started talking about the injustices and within the food industry people
[1:57:47.240 --> 1:57:52.120]  wanted to share this information they wanted to not only safeguard themselves with the information
[1:57:52.120 --> 1:57:58.040]  i uncovered but they wanted their friends and their family to know as well and so these campaigns
[1:57:58.040 --> 1:58:05.080]  that i launched are are are specifically targeted to increase the amount of discourse we have in
[1:58:05.080 --> 1:58:10.680]  this country about food ingredients about what's happening to the food supply about the lack of
[1:58:10.680 --> 1:58:15.240]  transparency in these food and beverage companies why are you being a conspiracy theorist there's no
[1:58:15.240 --> 1:58:21.800]  additives in the food everything's fine you know it's funny because you know i think our friend
[1:58:21.800 --> 1:58:27.240]  mike adams recently talked about how being a conspiracy theorist is actually a good thing
[1:58:27.240 --> 1:58:32.360]  and not being one means you're pretty much dumb because if you don't question things you never
[1:58:33.080 --> 1:58:36.840]  really get down to the point i know you gotta go can you do five more minutes with us in one minute

[2:00:42.520 --> 2:00:47.960]  food babe dot com other points that need to be said because you were getting into the fact that
[2:00:47.960 --> 2:00:53.080]  that it's good to be called a conspiracy theorist that's like being called a heretic when you know
[2:00:53.080 --> 2:01:00.360]  people 500 years ago 600 years ago said the earth wasn't flat i mean it's like being persecuted by
[2:01:00.360 --> 2:01:05.320]  the nazis i mean that's a good thing that you weren't for the nazis i mean this is the new term
[2:01:05.320 --> 2:01:10.360]  they've used for 30 years it doesn't work anymore so final comments yeah it doesn't work you know
[2:01:10.360 --> 2:01:15.640]  and there's no conspiracy about this the only conspiracy that's happening actually is within
[2:01:15.640 --> 2:01:20.520]  the beer companies how they've lobbied the treasury department and the government to keep this
[2:01:20.520 --> 2:01:27.000]  information secret from us so they can continue to make really like really big bucks i'm talking
[2:01:27.000 --> 2:01:34.680]  billions of dollars by selling us cheap harmful chemicals to us and you know what's what's really
[2:01:34.680 --> 2:01:41.800]  important here when people start to think about these issues is that one signature one voice
[2:01:41.800 --> 2:01:48.840]  can can magnify thousands and so i just beg everyone to go to food babe dot com slash beer
[2:01:48.840 --> 2:01:55.000]  and sign the petition because if we get millions of people behind this these companies have no
[2:01:55.000 --> 2:02:00.680]  where to hide anymore because if people know about this information they stop to buy those brands
[2:02:00.680 --> 2:02:04.920]  they start buying other brands or maybe they stop drinking beer all together which i did
[2:02:04.920 --> 2:02:12.120]  um as a result uh you know and this is what increases the the the health of the nation the
[2:02:12.120 --> 2:02:19.000]  health of uh transparency in the in our food environment and i think you know by doing these
[2:02:19.000 --> 2:02:24.520]  type of campaigns led by you know someone like myself and i hope others have enough courage to
[2:02:24.520 --> 2:02:29.960]  do these type of campaigns on their own in their own blogs i think we can really take over the
[2:02:29.960 --> 2:02:35.160]  world because there's more people than there are that work at monsanto and that work at these beer
[2:02:35.160 --> 2:02:41.480]  companies and and there's more people collectively that pay for their products that we can actually
[2:02:41.480 --> 2:02:46.520]  take back the ownership and start voting with our dollars and doing the right thing and you know
[2:02:46.520 --> 2:02:52.280]  before the break alex you asked me you said you know what what do you think has made your campaign
[2:02:52.280 --> 2:02:59.160]  so successful and i just i just want to reiterate the fact that make your voice heard tell the truth
[2:02:59.160 --> 2:03:04.920]  and ask your friends and family to share it like ask them they say you know tell them like this
[2:03:04.920 --> 2:03:10.520]  information is so important will you share it with someone you know that drinks beer or know that eats
[2:03:10.520 --> 2:03:16.440]  gmo corn every day in the form of like subway sandwiches or whatever you know someone that
[2:03:16.440 --> 2:03:20.600]  you know and everybody knows someone right everyone knows someone who's drinking miller
[2:03:20.600 --> 2:03:25.800]  light or bud light like everyone i know knows somebody whether it's your college kid that's in
[2:03:25.800 --> 2:03:31.560]  college at a college party or if it's your dad or if it's you know your neighbor or it's the person
[2:03:31.560 --> 2:03:38.360]  that brings the brew to the next barbecue we all know someone drinking these brands shoot just walk
[2:03:38.360 --> 2:03:43.400]  down the street and go into a bar and start telling people the truth about what's really in your beer
[2:03:43.400 --> 2:03:47.800]  and say hey bro you know why you know beer gives such a big belly it's the high fructose corn syrup
[2:03:47.800 --> 2:03:52.440]  is spending there for 30 years you know you ought to drink a local brew and say and say look i'm not
[2:03:52.440 --> 2:03:57.880]  unpacking you i care about you and people will be very thankful and you know i think you can also
[2:03:57.880 --> 2:04:02.680]  say hey did you hear about the food babe man she's smoking you ought to check her out and
[2:04:02.680 --> 2:04:08.200]  she discovered all this stuff that's in the beer they want to keep it secret that's exactly right
[2:04:08.200 --> 2:04:13.960]  you know and um well the thing is is a lot of people i know the haters are going to come out
[2:04:13.960 --> 2:04:18.760]  and what they're going to say is they're going to be like oh food babe wants to take away our beer
[2:04:18.760 --> 2:04:24.120]  she's trying to make a a mountain of a molehill you know and i'm not trying to do any of that hey
[2:04:24.120 --> 2:04:28.440]  if that's the case show us what's in it if that's the case tell us because i mean there should only
[2:04:28.440 --> 2:04:33.880]  be four or five ingredients in beer right there shouldn't be 20 and i'm not targeting the government
[2:04:33.880 --> 2:04:38.680]  you know the government could continue to be the most dysfunctional thing that's ever existed like
[2:04:38.680 --> 2:04:43.880]  it is today you know i'm not targeting them i'm targeting these companies that have the power
[2:04:43.880 --> 2:04:49.080]  to make these decisions in a heartbeat they could get their ingredients online that's why you're so
[2:04:49.080 --> 2:04:54.360]  successful because you're bypassing the bureaucracy going right to the culprits and calling them out
[2:04:54.360 --> 2:05:00.040]  we salute you food babe great job we'll talk to you soon great thank you alex this is leah and

[2:09:03.880 --> 2:09:08.840]  to date in our nation's effort to defeat al-qaeda because haliban is taking responsibility for
[2:09:08.840 --> 2:09:13.880]  shooting down a u.s. helicopter more than 30 people were killed and there are reports this morning
[2:09:13.880 --> 2:09:20.440]  that most of them are u.s. navy seals there may be a false flag incident where some ship goes down
[2:09:20.440 --> 2:09:24.920]  and you'd be used for the excuse to accelerate the next war but there's one thing that has
[2:09:24.920 --> 2:09:30.520]  unified democrats and republicans and everybody in between is that we all hated the bank bailout
[2:09:30.520 --> 2:09:36.040]  the department of homeland security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree it comes out to like
[2:09:36.040 --> 2:09:43.160]  1.6 billion rounds of ammunition today it is infinitely easier to kill a million people
[2:09:43.160 --> 2:09:48.600]  and to control a million they estimated that they would have to eliminate 25 million people
[2:09:48.600 --> 2:09:53.160]  in these reeducation centers and when i say eliminate i mean kill i'm here to warn people
[2:09:53.160 --> 2:10:01.880]  you keep telling me to shut up this isn't a game from the front lines of the information war it's
[2:10:01.880 --> 2:10:15.480]  alex jones we're live folks now in two hour number three and we have coming up
[2:10:17.400 --> 2:10:21.640]  at the bottom of the hour a very popular comic book illustrator and writer
[2:10:22.840 --> 2:10:29.640]  who's worked for dc you name it she's done one on snowden and i'm in the comic drudge
[2:10:29.640 --> 2:10:35.240]  linked to it last week i got a lot of national attention but she's also done some study into
[2:10:35.240 --> 2:10:41.640]  the iconography and art types of the joker and why is associated with so many senseless murders
[2:10:42.600 --> 2:10:47.160]  and now some other comic book characters as well we're not blaming the comic book characters it's
[2:10:47.160 --> 2:10:54.360]  like what is in the psychology of these people uh that's coming up now before we go any further
[2:10:54.360 --> 2:11:01.560]  there is just so much news but i'm gonna be honest with you obama coming out on cbs nightly news
[2:11:02.920 --> 2:11:12.040]  last night and saying that we need to do what australia did
[2:11:14.280 --> 2:11:17.880]  and they they didn't put up with it they had one shooting and that was it the guns were gone
[2:11:17.880 --> 2:11:21.720]  i mean they confiscated it they had full auto semi auto they took everything but single shot
[2:11:21.720 --> 2:11:26.360]  but with a special license they wanted to say we have an epidemic of mass shootings no we don't
[2:11:26.360 --> 2:11:31.720]  we have the media hyping them where the car backfires now they shut down half a city
[2:11:33.320 --> 2:11:38.600]  or one supposed terrorist is on the run so you lock down all you know half of uh
[2:11:38.600 --> 2:11:43.080]  boston and point guns at blonde haired women and black ladies that don't fit the description
[2:11:45.480 --> 2:11:49.480]  you know one guy's running on the loose dorner shooting a few cops was terrible but
[2:11:49.480 --> 2:11:54.200]  and they locked down half of southern california and then you shoot up black people's cars black
[2:11:54.200 --> 2:11:58.440]  women's cars blond's cars white men's cars look nothing like him
[2:12:01.960 --> 2:12:04.760]  i mean it reminds me you take somebody who's never gone deer hunting before and they get
[2:12:04.760 --> 2:12:09.400]  buck fever and you know they they shoot the first doe that comes out and you're like man
[2:12:09.400 --> 2:12:13.080]  we're not shooting doe we're shooting bucks well i thought it had antlers
[2:12:15.080 --> 2:12:19.080]  he takes people buck fever i've heard of shooting people's cows across a fence i thought it was a
[2:12:19.080 --> 2:12:24.680]  deer they want to shoot something and you've got a percentage of cops that are like that and they
[2:12:24.680 --> 2:12:31.160]  just want to shoot somebody and the system defends them the system is out of control folks it protects
[2:12:31.160 --> 2:12:37.800]  failure it protects screwing up we didn't have hardly any nuclear reactors leaking 30 years ago
[2:12:37.800 --> 2:12:44.920]  and we had more of them then 93 percent of us reactors are leaking look it up department of
[2:12:44.920 --> 2:12:51.160]  energy leaking they turn the alarms off now used to in minnesota and california and
[2:12:52.760 --> 2:12:56.760]  if if if radiation came out and they had to off gas it they would have announcements
[2:12:59.480 --> 2:13:05.800]  radiation has been released check local news for details radiation has been released because by
[2:13:05.800 --> 2:13:09.640]  law they're supposed to tell you well they just ignore the law now and made an announcement
[2:13:09.640 --> 2:13:13.640]  was in southern california at one plant last year yeah we were turning the alarm off because
[2:13:13.640 --> 2:13:19.400]  it's scaring people it's going off every week they just dump radiation of the water into the air now
[2:13:21.240 --> 2:13:29.720]  crazy cops don't get in trouble when they shoot up a car that doesn't even match the description
[2:13:30.280 --> 2:13:35.960]  with two blondes driving it because they thought it was donor they didn't get in trouble you want
[2:13:35.960 --> 2:13:43.960]  someone out there well they were scared well then that's not the cop of guys you need then is it it
[2:13:43.960 --> 2:13:49.160]  be bad enough if they shot some black guy that looked like him for no reason but you could argue
[2:13:49.160 --> 2:13:53.640]  well it was a big black guy with a shaved head and a truck that looked the same and it was a cell
[2:13:53.640 --> 2:13:57.320]  phone we thought it was a gun well it'd be a tragedy you have to pay out a bunch of money
[2:13:57.320 --> 2:14:00.920]  there had to be an investigation you wouldn't get fired for that because at least you thought
[2:14:00.920 --> 2:14:08.920]  how do you shoot up a car with two blondes in it or a nerdy white guy in broad daylight
[2:14:10.120 --> 2:14:14.760]  and then no one gets in trouble it's just you're all dressed up in army outfits
[2:14:14.760 --> 2:14:19.640]  and you're lusting after this great glorious war you're going to have with the gun owners and the
[2:14:19.640 --> 2:14:28.840]  veterans i mean that just sounds horrible and they're telling the cops you will face veterans
[2:14:28.840 --> 2:14:34.120]  they will bomb you it is coming that's mainstream news we told you first years ago it's mainstream
[2:14:34.120 --> 2:14:38.440]  news their training north comms training to fight veterans and they're going to start
[2:14:38.440 --> 2:14:46.760]  fights with veterans and veterans are going to go haywire and it really kicks off i think
[2:14:46.760 --> 2:14:50.840]  has been it much as 10% of veterans are going to pull guns off the shelves off their gun racks
[2:14:50.840 --> 2:14:57.720]  it's just unbelievable the world is never going to see anything like this there's never been anything
[2:14:57.720 --> 2:15:01.800]  like this that's about to happen if this kicks off and i'm doing everything i can to try to stop it
[2:15:04.280 --> 2:15:10.680]  and i am deader than a box of nails if this thing goes off they're going to come after me like that
[2:15:12.840 --> 2:15:19.000]  so believe me i'm in the boat with the cops i don't i mean i don't want them to die i don't
[2:15:19.000 --> 2:15:24.920]  want to die i don't want this to happen but george soros and the globalists are going to
[2:15:24.920 --> 2:15:30.440]  sit up there in their ivory towers with all their bodyguards when they want our guns and they
[2:15:30.440 --> 2:15:33.320]  they're going to have you who they hate the military and the police they hate your guts they
[2:15:33.320 --> 2:15:38.280]  know you're libertarian most of you most police i know are more informed the public by far they
[2:15:38.280 --> 2:15:43.160]  hate your guts and they're going to start this civil war and it is going to be a nightmare
[2:15:43.160 --> 2:15:49.080]  that's their plan and then riding in on his white horse like napoleon like lincoln here comes obama
[2:15:49.080 --> 2:15:55.880]  oh he'll crush the tea party he'll crush the terrorist they'll crush alex jones
[2:16:02.680 --> 2:16:06.280]  i mean i'll just say this i'm not going after anybody
[2:16:09.160 --> 2:16:12.600]  but if somebody pulls up and starts shooting at me or whatever i'll have to defend myself
[2:16:12.600 --> 2:16:23.320]  and i'm not afraid actually i'm afraid for my children and i'm afraid for this country
[2:16:23.320 --> 2:16:27.880]  of simple minded people that have no idea what's going on i mean we're living in something 10 times
[2:16:27.880 --> 2:16:38.760]  past the james bond movie i mean this is epic what's going on epic epic upon epic upon epic
[2:16:38.760 --> 2:16:44.920]  epic this is the fall of america for real for real
[2:16:46.840 --> 2:16:52.840]  with a bunch of crazy communist ideologs working for goldman sacks and big banks
[2:16:52.840 --> 2:16:58.040]  who think they can run a communist ideology takeover and then it's going to work i mean my god
[2:16:58.040 --> 2:17:03.480]  it's this country is going to blow sky high by the way if you were ever going to evacuate the
[2:17:03.480 --> 2:17:11.320]  united states now is the time to get out of here i'm i'm staying but i mean i'm going to tell you
[2:17:11.320 --> 2:17:15.160]  right now if you want to go overseas and report on what's going on the info war that might be a
[2:17:15.160 --> 2:17:19.720]  good time i mean and all the rich people most the rich people in the they've been pulling out for
[2:17:19.720 --> 2:17:23.960]  five years that's in the news and buying armored redoubts all over the world because they know i
[2:17:23.960 --> 2:17:28.200]  mean they have just billionaires are freaked out when they hear even part of this plan
[2:17:28.200 --> 2:17:34.120]  and from the globalists i mean they're like what you're gonna have a civil war with 170 million
[2:17:34.120 --> 2:17:37.800]  gun owners mainly veterans you're gonna try to hunt down all the veterans and kill them
[2:17:38.680 --> 2:17:46.200]  in reeducation camps as the fbi discovered with the groth john graph wall before back when the fbi
[2:17:46.200 --> 2:17:53.240]  wasn't completely out of control i mean my god i mean listen you're gonna force millions of people
[2:17:53.240 --> 2:17:59.320]  to fight to the death i mean do you have any idea what that's gonna look like
[2:18:04.120 --> 2:18:07.000]  i mean you're gonna need a lot more armored vehicles that's all i mean now you could have
[2:18:07.000 --> 2:18:11.080]  a million of men in gonna help you you could put one guy in each armored vehicle that's not gonna
[2:18:11.080 --> 2:18:18.680]  help you and you know that you're not stupid so are we gonna let this happen

[2:39:25.320 --> 2:39:30.600]  openly pro liberty with a new comic book an illustrated novel i guess you could call is
[2:39:30.600 --> 2:39:36.040]  what looks like to me on edward snowden and i've told that i even a minute i'll get a copy of that
[2:39:36.040 --> 2:39:41.240]  oh my son loves comic books and some of my daughters and so thank you so much for coming on and uh
[2:39:41.240 --> 2:39:46.600]  tell us about your political views on this where you're going and uh who you're publishing this through
[2:39:46.600 --> 2:39:54.520]  and uh absolutely thank you so much for having me on this is this is fantastic being here um
[2:39:54.520 --> 2:40:01.880]  um basically uh i believe in um you know the american public you know knowing what information
[2:40:01.880 --> 2:40:10.120]  gets i gathered about them online and being aware and being informed and active um and that's what
[2:40:10.120 --> 2:40:17.880]  drew me to the uh the edward snowden um project and uh also he was apparently a big uh cartoon
[2:40:17.880 --> 2:40:24.680]  and video game and comic books fan himself so that was sort of another reason i felt like a
[2:40:24.680 --> 2:40:30.920]  kind of in touch with the person and um i just approached blue water productions with this idea
[2:40:30.920 --> 2:40:36.680]  for a comic book series about this and other current events topics and we just took it from there
[2:40:37.960 --> 2:40:42.840]  wow and tell us about blue water because in this world of universal deceit telling the
[2:40:42.840 --> 2:40:47.640]  truce a revolutionary act i'd love to see dc or somebody do this this is how we win the culture
[2:40:47.640 --> 2:40:51.960]  war for liberty and restore the republic but blue water is pretty big as well though they're more
[2:40:51.960 --> 2:40:58.440]  independent how'd you get them to publish this um literally i just came up with the idea um i've
[2:40:58.440 --> 2:41:02.840]  always been interested and i guess what the mainstream media calls quote unquote conspiracy
[2:41:02.840 --> 2:41:08.600]  theories but rather like you know alternative news and um i always you know love comic books and i
[2:41:08.600 --> 2:41:15.320]  wanted to put them together as one project and i just um called blue water and they just kind of
[2:41:15.320 --> 2:41:21.880]  immediately bought the project and you know enthusiastically put it out and please just punch
[2:41:21.880 --> 2:41:29.160]  and i'd love to do more now again for folks that don't understand the system is trying to suppress
[2:41:29.160 --> 2:41:36.200]  writers graphic people you name it from promoting uh just any form of basic liberty if if this is a
[2:41:36.200 --> 2:41:39.960]  successful publication it's already been i don't know how time magazine promoted it
[2:41:39.960 --> 2:41:45.080]  drugs linked to it but i expect drugs to link to it i mean it's why do you think time magazine
[2:41:46.040 --> 2:41:50.040]  would uh feature something like this or does it show how mainstream it's gone
[2:41:50.040 --> 2:41:56.200]  to be angry at the nsa i think Edward Stoughton and and this whole story is just a story that
[2:41:56.200 --> 2:42:01.000]  everybody's completely fascinated with and i think people the media and people are also really
[2:42:01.000 --> 2:42:06.760]  fascinated with comic books right now so it seems to be the perfect project that uh all the mainstream
[2:42:06.760 --> 2:42:15.720]  media seem to glom on to and want to talk about i haven't gotten an actual copy of it yet tell me
[2:42:15.720 --> 2:42:24.120]  if is it already out or is it coming out it is a it's a out available on all digital formats as
[2:42:24.120 --> 2:42:31.480]  an ebook um amazon nook kindle if you go to my website valerie dorasio.com it gives you full
[2:42:31.480 --> 2:42:37.880]  instructions and links and where to get it you can also order a print comic at comic flea market.com
[2:42:40.440 --> 2:42:46.200]  well it's really exciting what you're doing describe basically uh from what i've seen it
[2:42:46.200 --> 2:42:50.440]  looks like the comic is basically a narrative for people that wouldn't normally be informed about
[2:42:50.440 --> 2:42:54.840]  snowden kind of non-newsreaders to a great extent i would say at least some people that read comic
[2:42:54.840 --> 2:43:02.840]  books and kind of tailor to an adult but also a younger audience yes um you know i i originally
[2:43:02.840 --> 2:43:07.720]  approached the project just to do sort of a straight educational comic book without like
[2:43:07.720 --> 2:43:13.960]  an opinion one way or another about him but as i got further into it it became more um you know
[2:43:13.960 --> 2:43:19.000]  like history is so dramatic became more of like a real comic book story full of twists and turns
[2:43:19.000 --> 2:43:25.960]  and the reality is the ultimate adventure yes it is it absolutely is and sometimes reality is
[2:43:25.960 --> 2:43:32.200]  stranger than fiction and i think that's absolutely the case with snowden um and i there's a lot of
[2:43:32.200 --> 2:43:39.240]  unanswered questions i think about him that i address in this book and bring up um and yeah
[2:43:39.240 --> 2:43:43.800]  but and i just want to sort of communicate that and also communicate to the american public you
[2:43:43.800 --> 2:43:49.240]  know how the nsa was using this information like i have one page in the book that explains it in a
[2:43:49.240 --> 2:43:54.760]  humorous way how their information would have been accessed through this program and comic books
[2:43:54.760 --> 2:43:59.960]  are just a wonderful way to communicate and educate the public by the way you know it's in
[2:43:59.960 --> 2:44:07.560]  mainstream news today all over the place that indeed nsa workers including at home were charged with
[2:44:07.560 --> 2:44:12.840]  listening to all these public figures and media people i mean that they are listening to prominent
[2:44:12.840 --> 2:44:19.080]  people they they do listen to my phone they and and they don't doubt it they do record pretty much
[2:44:19.080 --> 2:44:24.520]  everything and they got caught lying about it and now they're basically trying to say you're a terrorist
[2:44:24.520 --> 2:44:28.520]  if you think the government's out of control i mean how much more crazy do you think this is
[2:44:28.520 --> 2:44:35.960]  going to get before we turn the corner well i mean even not even just the nsa like um eavesdropping
[2:44:35.960 --> 2:44:40.120]  i mean just like you know people who have alternative viewpoints i mean they're you know
[2:44:40.120 --> 2:44:44.680]  you know they're getting more and more sort of blamed for stuff and people are suggesting people
[2:44:44.680 --> 2:44:51.080]  who believe in chemtrails and you know climate change issues like denial whatever should be
[2:44:51.080 --> 2:44:56.440]  put in jail or should be put mental institutions and uh some of this is coming from people who are
[2:44:56.440 --> 2:45:01.560]  normally very progressive so i find that all very concerning because while i may not agree
[2:45:01.560 --> 2:45:06.360]  with every issue that you know you believe in or other people believe in i believe people have
[2:45:06.360 --> 2:45:13.080]  the right to to express these opinions without fear of being put in jail or you know locked away
[2:45:13.080 --> 2:45:19.480]  in a psych ward or something well exactly and again if you just joined us we're talking to a
[2:45:19.480 --> 2:45:28.360]  well-known successful comic book writer and editor who has just released the edward snowden
[2:45:28.360 --> 2:45:34.360]  comic book as a comic book hero graphic novel beyond edward snowden will hit shelves later this month
[2:45:34.360 --> 2:45:40.600]  exploring nsa whistleblowers motivation or taking part in the largest leak of classified
[2:45:40.600 --> 2:45:47.640]  information in us history well no it's a disclosure of criminal illegal spying they lied about
[2:45:47.640 --> 2:45:52.600]  that we've had dozens and dozens of big whistleblowers bigger than him it just never got media
[2:45:52.600 --> 2:45:57.800]  attention why do you think snowden's gotten so much attention compared to all the other telecom
[2:45:57.800 --> 2:46:04.920]  whistleblowers nsa whistleblowers wane madson so many others uh you know honestly i think part of
[2:46:04.920 --> 2:46:13.640]  it is that he's very photogenic and he's very much representative of that sort of geek culture of
[2:46:13.640 --> 2:46:19.400]  like i said video games pop culture comic books cartoons and i think he's you know kind of hit
[2:46:19.400 --> 2:46:25.560]  the zeitgeist at the right time and i think that's part of why people are so fascinated with him um
[2:46:25.560 --> 2:46:31.400]  um valerie dorazio again is our guest valerie dorazio dot com i agree with you and and and
[2:46:31.400 --> 2:46:35.800]  they've denied all this is going on they denied basically everything i'm saying is going on now
[2:46:35.800 --> 2:46:39.800]  it's all public so they've got a major issue they want to put it back on edward snowden or
[2:46:39.800 --> 2:46:44.920]  alex jones or you or ron paul or anybody that questions them but they're the ones driving
[2:46:44.920 --> 2:46:50.920]  the train off the cliff and so you know people aren't listening to the criticism anymore and
[2:46:50.920 --> 2:46:57.640]  really they've the public's lost all confidence in the system i mean republican establishment canner
[2:46:57.640 --> 2:47:02.360]  just got defeated in the primary democrats are getting defeated in their primaries uh by people
[2:47:02.360 --> 2:47:07.000]  coming from nowhere who are saying they're against what obama is doing and so we call it left or right
[2:47:07.000 --> 2:47:12.200]  they want to keep us in that if the republicans were doing the things that obama is doing i would
[2:47:12.200 --> 2:47:16.200]  be screaming bloody murder in fact i was under bush and i thought he was the worst ever i mean
[2:47:16.200 --> 2:47:22.040]  obama using his progressive credentials has just made the good progressives out there who
[2:47:22.040 --> 2:47:26.840]  aren't really just authoritarian kleptocrats posing as as liberals you know thomas jefferson's
[2:47:26.840 --> 2:47:33.240]  a liberal i say that every day bill clinton and and al gore our shysters and obama is a shyster
[2:47:34.440 --> 2:47:39.880]  and joe biden's a shyster and hillary clinton's a criminal i mean they're all just frauds and
[2:47:39.880 --> 2:47:45.560]  a bunch of republicans are bad as well so my issue is is they call it a right wing issue that i want
[2:47:45.560 --> 2:47:51.240]  to own guns to protect myself they call it a right wing issue that i want some national sovereignty
[2:47:51.240 --> 2:47:57.640]  no it's just common sense the mexico's collapsing into us now mexico's a failed state and now it's
[2:47:57.640 --> 2:48:03.480]  collapsing military bases all over the u.s in total squalor i mean it's we're being overrun and obama's
[2:48:03.480 --> 2:48:09.080]  overrunning the country saying come here come here to cause a crisis we're seeing insane times so
[2:48:09.080 --> 2:48:16.440]  so it's self-defense it's survival i don't think d or r but the entire republican party
[2:48:16.440 --> 2:48:21.640]  at the leadership level is working with the democrats to stop the true tea party and call
[2:48:21.640 --> 2:48:26.280]  them racist and they're doing that because ron paul and myself and others started the tea party
[2:48:26.280 --> 2:48:30.920]  back in my 2006 it was an organic liberty movement we would call it tea parties it was
[2:48:30.920 --> 2:48:35.640]  protesting republicans and democrats in 2007 and 2008 the republicans were smart and came in and
[2:48:35.640 --> 2:48:40.760]  tried to take it over that backfired and the tea party took them over so now they go the tea party
[2:48:40.760 --> 2:48:45.720]  is dead and discredited as it takes over so that's the sigh i don't mean to go off on a rant but
[2:48:45.720 --> 2:48:49.640]  yeah when you say you know i'm more of a progressive or whatever but or they're not
[2:48:49.640 --> 2:48:53.480]  long progressive ideas i agree with some of what you're saying not some of the other exactly doesn't
[2:48:53.480 --> 2:49:00.360]  matter if who you are gay straight black white tyranny is coming down on us we can settle any
[2:49:00.360 --> 2:49:04.600]  differences later but right now this country's going to hell in a handbasket how would you
[2:49:04.600 --> 2:49:11.080]  describe what's going on in the nation right now well like i don't believe in left or right or black
[2:49:11.080 --> 2:49:16.680]  and white because reality is not like that reality shades of gray and so i believe that more and more
[2:49:16.680 --> 2:49:22.040]  people are you know becoming independent thinkers and i think it's very important to become independent
[2:49:22.040 --> 2:49:26.920]  thinkers i believe a lot of people are being disillusioned by this black or white left or right
[2:49:26.920 --> 2:49:32.920]  sort of dichotomy and um you know in that sense i have a lot of optimism i think there's a lot of
[2:49:32.920 --> 2:49:38.120]  you know people really using critical thinking applying it to the you know the news that they
[2:49:38.120 --> 2:49:45.560]  watch and you know wanting to be you know to have liberty and to have you know to not to be caught in
[2:49:45.560 --> 2:49:52.440]  this black or white left to right sort of jail and uh you know i think there's a great awakening
[2:49:52.440 --> 2:49:56.680]  happening in this country and i think you know that particular thing i think that's a great thing
[2:49:56.680 --> 2:50:00.920]  i try to i try to focus on the positive thoughts because if i have to focus on this all the negative
[2:50:00.920 --> 2:50:05.960]  i'll be really you know sad and depressed all the time but uh i think there's some positive there
[2:50:07.240 --> 2:50:13.720]  valerie dorazio.com is the website and i guess it hits store shelves here very soon because that

[2:54:33.320 --> 2:54:41.240]  which one bottom line the republican leadership is panicking we have articles on info wars.com
[2:54:41.240 --> 2:54:47.320]  they are declaring total war on the tea party freaking out and the public knows the systems
[2:54:47.320 --> 2:54:51.320]  a bunch of liars so when they get attacked that's an endorsement when they attack me and say i'm
[2:54:51.320 --> 2:54:55.880]  behind the shootings that's an endorsement that means that's how discredited they are they got a
[2:54:55.880 --> 2:55:01.800]  nine percent congressional approval rating as low as six in some Gallup polls i think north Korean
[2:55:01.800 --> 2:55:07.400]  leaders are probably more popular than that in their country i mean this is a group of crooks on
[2:55:07.400 --> 2:55:14.360]  average and they are the jokers destroying our society never getting in trouble for what they do
[2:55:14.360 --> 2:55:19.560]  and i'm telling you we're in false flag territory they know that there's a revolution through the
[2:55:19.560 --> 2:55:23.240]  voting right now and they're not going to want to let that happen they're going to want to blame
[2:55:23.240 --> 2:55:28.920]  the tea party i mean they could do anything say a tea partier that worked at a nuclear power plant
[2:55:28.920 --> 2:55:33.640]  blows it up with explosives and radiates a city i mean you name it something horrible they'll pull
[2:55:33.640 --> 2:55:41.160]  it the people like man that's wild folks that's what they do they just caught nato with turkey
[2:55:41.160 --> 2:55:45.720]  launching a chemical attacks with Saudi Arabia and blaming it on Assad that was even in the bbc
[2:55:45.720 --> 2:55:52.440]  and sigh hirs they've killed 300 000 people mainly christians our government is funding al qaeda to
[2:55:52.440 --> 2:55:59.560]  kill hundreds of thousands of people now do you think they'll pull something just watch i know them
[2:56:00.600 --> 2:56:05.480]  but see that doesn't even work anymore people like fine a tea partier don't blame us a tea
[2:56:05.480 --> 2:56:10.760]  party to blow up a nuclear power plant or a tea party or shot up a police station we don't even
[2:56:10.760 --> 2:56:14.040]  know what happened there but doesn't matter George wash is not bad because somebody that liked him
[2:56:14.040 --> 2:56:21.000]  did that you the people that caused this let's let's with this whole atmosphere i'm unbowed i
[2:56:21.000 --> 2:56:26.840]  don't take the guilt of everything you say i've done valerie enclosing at about three minutes
[2:56:26.840 --> 2:56:30.600]  what is the archetype of the joker why do you think it's connected to so many horrible events
[2:56:31.400 --> 2:56:35.880]  i have an ancient archetype called the uh the trickster that's you know thousands and thousands
[2:56:35.880 --> 2:56:41.880]  of years old and um you know it's a these types of symbols hit people in a very primal part of
[2:56:41.880 --> 2:56:46.680]  their brain and they can you know be used to connect with people in a very deep way
[2:56:46.680 --> 2:56:56.200]  yeah uh well in kind of the deeper satanism that that type of leering smiling demonic face is uh
[2:56:57.000 --> 2:57:06.280]  is uh associated with just rampine mass murder of innocence yeah i mean it's a very you know
[2:57:06.280 --> 2:57:13.000]  for lack of a better word sort of demonic um presence um and so like in i'm not surprised
[2:57:13.000 --> 2:57:18.760]  that there have been a lot of crimes you know connected to figures like him and you know now
[2:57:18.760 --> 2:57:25.480]  the slender man uh stabbing is the most recent uh sort of stuff so yeah it's absolutely very
[2:57:25.480 --> 2:57:34.520]  powerful powerful image well maybe you should do who is joker is that dc comics that's dc comics
[2:57:34.520 --> 2:57:41.400]  yep man can you imagine if they did one on why the joker you know in in in iconography or icons
[2:57:41.400 --> 2:57:49.000]  is so wicked i mean that would be a best-seller and would explain why because i i i did a joker
[2:57:49.000 --> 2:57:53.000]  piece once when the batman movie came out three or four years ago and my listeners got really
[2:57:53.000 --> 2:57:57.960]  freaked out and thought i was a bad person because i could act like the joker i mean people got
[2:57:57.960 --> 2:58:04.040]  really disturbed by that yeah i mean it's a very you know i mean writing the book it was a very
[2:58:04.040 --> 2:58:09.400]  kind of um my book the joker was a very kind of uh disturbing book to write you know you really
[2:58:09.400 --> 2:58:12.920]  kind of need to get that energy off yourself once you're kind of involved with it a little bit
[2:58:13.640 --> 2:58:17.880]  so i totally know where you're coming from um but yeah there's been joker related crimes since
[2:58:17.880 --> 2:58:24.520]  2008 um well some of the heavy and sort of small crimes and some of the light shootings and stabbings
[2:58:25.640 --> 2:58:30.600]  yeah absolutely it's it's bizarre but we shouldn't ban the joker comic because it's
[2:58:30.600 --> 2:58:34.120]  mentally ill people that are clicking with that thank you so much amazing nightly news will be
