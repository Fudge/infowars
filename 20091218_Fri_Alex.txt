[00:00.000 --> 00:13.260]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[00:13.260 --> 00:20.800]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas
[00:20.800 --> 00:32.280]  alex jones well as of an hour ago we have the latest draft which the media is
[00:32.280 --> 00:38.720]  reporting maybe the final draft of the global government treaty the global
[00:38.720 --> 00:42.860]  governance treaty the most important meeting in the history of the united
[00:42.860 --> 00:48.800]  nations and that is in their words and it certainly is and it has the global
[00:48.800 --> 00:55.640]  tax it has the 2% tax on all nations it has a money transfer tax in it it is
[00:55.640 --> 01:02.120]  just unbelievably corrupt and it gives the private IMF and world bank that the
[01:02.120 --> 01:10.220]  taxes are paid to the power to selectively enforce the rules we'll be
[01:10.220 --> 01:16.360]  discussing that on this friday the eighteenth day of December 2009 edition
[01:16.360 --> 01:21.600]  i've seen some comments on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com and i've
[01:21.600 --> 01:26.520]  gotten a few emails saying why are you spending so much time on climate gate and
[01:26.520 --> 01:31.480]  not more time on government takeover of health care well you must not be
[01:31.480 --> 01:35.920]  listening we've been spending a lot of time on government health care we're
[01:35.920 --> 01:39.520]  trying to beat it in the senate if that doesn't work we have a chance to beat it
[01:39.520 --> 01:45.880]  in the house right now the momentum is shifting in our direction but that has
[01:45.880 --> 01:50.080]  been widely debated all over the united states the people know about the
[01:50.080 --> 01:53.720]  prison time the five years if you don't get present the quarter million dollar
[01:53.720 --> 01:59.840]  fine we've been beating the drum for the last six months fighting it and it's
[01:59.840 --> 02:06.200]  important but you can always repeal government health care it'll be hard to
[02:06.200 --> 02:11.360]  do we can fight at the state level as well we can always fight the death
[02:11.360 --> 02:17.960]  panels as as as big as government takeover of health care is quite frankly
[02:17.960 --> 02:25.520]  it's nothing compared to open world government being established and the
[02:25.520 --> 02:29.920]  president signing us on to a treaty and saying he doesn't care if congress
[02:29.920 --> 02:34.480]  doesn't implement it that the united states will submit to global governance
[02:34.480 --> 02:40.560]  and he's up there demonizing america is this great evil this is a un speech
[02:40.560 --> 02:45.920]  today we're gonna be playing it and we've got to pay for our evil carbon I
[02:45.920 --> 02:51.200]  mean this is complete fraud and in the next segment I'm gonna play the audio
[02:51.200 --> 02:55.480]  from the president's entire speech it's only ten and a half minutes long and I'm
[02:55.480 --> 03:01.680]  gonna stop and start briefly just pointing out the lies but it's a fabric
[03:01.680 --> 03:08.680]  of lies a tissue of lies a compendium of lies it is a infinity of lies there's
[03:08.680 --> 03:13.280]  so many lies and so many intricacies you could analyze the lies and fraud of
[03:13.280 --> 03:20.480]  this forever because it it just ties into so many facets of government and the
[03:20.480 --> 03:26.400]  corrupt system we live under we are not just covering the climategate fraud we're
[03:26.400 --> 03:30.920]  not just covering whether man-made global warming is real or not we're
[03:30.920 --> 03:36.920]  discussing the issue of a dictatorial planetary government being established
[03:36.920 --> 03:42.760]  that once established is going to force global one-child policies forced
[03:42.760 --> 03:49.000]  druging of the population forced sterilization and abortion this is
[03:49.000 --> 03:54.160]  already going on in India and China and areas of Africa and Latin America where
[03:54.160 --> 03:59.200]  the UN comes in and pays off the governments to carry out sterilization
[03:59.200 --> 04:06.800]  arrest force drugging it's it's it's it's all part of history and we now have
[04:06.800 --> 04:11.440]  Fox News promoting putting lithium in the water I got news for you they're
[04:11.440 --> 04:19.240]  already doing it so global government the end of America the president in a
[04:19.240 --> 04:25.480]  treasonous fashion signing on to it as he's swearing to do this evening he says
[04:25.480 --> 04:30.080]  in fact even if it doesn't pass even if they can't get the other dictatorships
[04:30.080 --> 04:34.720]  and communist countries to sign on because it's too tyrannical he says
[04:34.720 --> 04:39.880]  he's gonna unilaterally implemented over the American people to the UN he's
[04:39.880 --> 04:44.960]  bringing us under UN IMF World Bank receivership whether we like it or not

[09:05.440 --> 09:10.480]  the next hour on a host of global issues and we're also going to be talking to
[09:10.480 --> 09:18.560]  John Shafer of a very popular rock band that's on scores of Billboard charts
[09:18.560 --> 09:26.680]  right now he is with the band iced earth but he is releasing today here on this
[09:26.680 --> 09:32.000]  radio show we're very honored that he contacted us to do this much of my crew
[09:32.000 --> 09:40.000]  or fans of ice earth iced earth has been around for a long time they are putting
[09:40.000 --> 09:46.320]  out a free album and I've listened to a lot of their music I think this is one
[09:46.320 --> 09:49.560]  of their best albums but because of the record label and things they're putting
[09:49.560 --> 09:55.320]  it out of the title sons of liberty because it's free and of course you
[09:55.320 --> 09:59.280]  can't have a record label that lets you put something out free so they the band
[09:59.280 --> 10:04.440]  put this out separately themselves for free and let me tell you it's some of
[10:04.440 --> 10:10.600]  the best work I've heard from iced earth and it is just amazing in fact I had a
[10:10.600 --> 10:17.120]  folder in here that had all the lyrics for iced earth in the Fed in the Fed the
[10:17.120 --> 10:24.200]  answer to 1974 1776 I'm setting bushfires in the minds of men you can
[10:24.200 --> 10:31.120]  better believe this radio show in our work and Ron Paul's work is a big big
[10:31.120 --> 10:35.360]  influence on some of the latest music from iced earth who reach millions of
[10:35.360 --> 10:39.480]  fans so we're excited about having him in here for a full hour of course it's
[10:39.480 --> 10:43.280]  the end of the Copenhagen event and the global government establishing event and
[10:43.280 --> 10:47.880]  and and it is an iced earth there record cold temperatures right now in
[10:47.880 --> 10:52.600]  Denmark and in Canada and in other areas of the world was snowing a week and a
[10:52.600 --> 10:57.520]  half ago in Houston Texas that's generally basically tropical down on the
[10:57.520 --> 11:06.000]  Gulf of Mexico entering into the mouth of the Caribbean so that is coming up
[11:06.000 --> 11:12.200]  later in the broadcast today oh and we have Robert Wannick the high school
[11:12.200 --> 11:18.680]  student who's won some of our contest awards an act of 9-11 truth or Robert
[11:18.680 --> 11:24.680]  Wannick got beat up by a teacher and suspended for handing out flu vaccine
[11:24.680 --> 11:29.520]  inserts you hand out the actual inserts that say it can give you cancer
[11:29.520 --> 11:36.800]  sterilize you kill you give you Guillain beret or Gillian beret in English has
[11:36.800 --> 11:41.400]  mercury in it it's all admitted in the insert you try to hand that out they get
[11:41.400 --> 11:46.760]  very angry and he's got witnesses of the fact that he was assaulted in America
[11:46.760 --> 11:52.560]  by this particular school teacher and so he will be joining us to talk about this
[11:52.560 --> 11:56.360]  today it's funny watching Wannick the last two years go from like a 13 year
[11:56.360 --> 12:00.560]  old kid to now the chin and the and the hormones going up and he's get turned
[12:00.560 --> 12:06.560]  into a man it's it's amazing to see that that that that transformation was a
[12:06.560 --> 12:11.280]  little kid a few years ago fighting the New World Order and now he let's just
[12:11.280 --> 12:14.520]  hope he can get out of high school but I'm setting him up and sending him down
[12:14.520 --> 12:23.400]  the river for daring to be a a a thought criminal so that is coming up today
[12:23.400 --> 12:29.280]  okay here's what I want to do right now this is a 10 and a half minute clip and
[12:29.280 --> 12:34.640]  in the rest of this segment the next segment I want to attempt to play the
[12:34.640 --> 12:40.240]  Obama speech and then stop it and make quick comments about his lies if I don't
[12:40.240 --> 12:44.280]  finish now I'll finish this later when we're live at prisonplanet.tv so you
[12:44.280 --> 12:48.240]  can watch the teleprompter reader he doesn't have a teleprompter here so he's
[12:48.240 --> 12:52.600]  having a lot of trouble and here he is you know the media said he was angry he
[12:52.600 --> 12:56.520]  was desperate he commits America even if the rest of the countries don't sign on
[12:56.520 --> 13:03.720]  and it's just all lies so we're gonna now critique and translate and break down
[13:03.720 --> 13:12.600]  the manifest congenital fraud of Barack H. Obama today in Copenhagen Denmark
[13:12.600 --> 13:17.640]  trying to force through according to what Ban Ki-moon says the birth of world
[13:17.640 --> 13:25.000]  government here it is it is an honor for me to join this distinguished group of
[13:25.000 --> 13:31.240]  leaders from nations around the world we come here in Copenhagen because
[13:31.240 --> 13:39.800]  climate change poses a grave and growing danger it was okay he just states
[13:39.800 --> 13:44.160]  that it's an absolute fact like the unified corporate press has been doing
[13:44.160 --> 13:48.560]  that it poses a great danger we've got to establish the global government you've
[13:48.560 --> 13:53.400]  got to pay these taxes to us or basically the earth is doomed I mean just
[13:53.400 --> 14:02.600]  fraud continue this is a grave and growing danger to our people all of you
[14:02.600 --> 14:09.200]  would not be here unless you like me were convinced that this danger is real
[14:09.200 --> 14:16.880]  it plus okay from the 191 governments there are conservatively on record more
[14:16.880 --> 14:22.480]  than 50 of the delegates there who are questioning man-made climate change and
[14:22.480 --> 14:27.360]  questioning climate gay and there are heads of state from any of these
[14:27.360 --> 14:33.720]  governments who are publicly saying it is a fraud but there he said you are all
[14:33.720 --> 14:38.040]  here you were all here in agreement he just keeps stating the lie that everyone
[14:38.040 --> 14:40.960]  knows the earth is doomed everyone knows we've got to have the global tax
[14:40.960 --> 14:45.680]  everyone is a it is an agreement so he just keeps stating the board lie that
[14:45.680 --> 14:50.880]  not only will you be assimilated you have been assimilated just all lies
[14:50.880 --> 14:58.800]  every word continue that this danger is real this is not fiction it is science
[14:58.800 --> 15:05.040]  hit boss back it up back it up 20 seconds I'm people to hear all this again so
[15:05.040 --> 15:08.720]  again he says you're all here if you want to save the earth all of you are
[15:08.720 --> 15:14.320]  in agreement you know this is real it's not some fiction now what you just heard
[15:14.320 --> 15:18.360]  is just and the body language says it's like Bill Clinton when he shook his
[15:18.360 --> 15:23.400]  finger and said I did not have sex with that woman Monica Lewinsky or read my
[15:23.400 --> 15:28.040]  lips no new taxes when everybody heard it they knew it was a lie when George
[15:28.040 --> 15:32.560]  Herbert Walker said it when Bill Clinton said it when Nixon said I'm not a crook
[15:32.560 --> 15:38.320]  I'm not a crook people knew he was a crook so here he is saying we all agree
[15:38.320 --> 15:44.280]  that's a lie everyone here agrees another line the science is settled
[15:44.280 --> 15:49.720]  another line this is not fiction another lie it is a complete fiction according
[15:49.720 --> 15:54.680]  to the words of the Club of Rome in the 1960s and again in 1991 and we have those
[15:54.680 --> 15:58.600]  articles directly from the Club of Rome posted the scans of their own
[15:58.600 --> 16:06.520]  publication saying we're making this up to bring in global government this is a
[16:06.520 --> 16:15.480]  grave and growing danger to our people all of you would not be here unless you
[16:15.480 --> 16:24.440]  like me were convinced that this danger is real this is not fiction it is science
[16:24.440 --> 16:32.560]  it pause it is science you got to love how the three top institutions NASA
[16:32.560 --> 16:38.840]  Goddard East Anglia University and the UN itself the three top groups the head
[16:38.840 --> 16:45.720]  of the IPCC has admitted now that he took out five scientists in the report
[16:45.720 --> 16:50.880]  who said man is not contributing to climate change the UN's own report says
[16:50.880 --> 16:59.080]  maybe a degree and that's a fraud but you've got to love how they always say
[16:59.080 --> 17:05.960]  well what's really happening here is sure there were some mistakes and some
[17:05.960 --> 17:09.480]  lying by a few low-level scientists but we have all these other hundreds of
[17:09.480 --> 17:14.000]  peer-reviewed journals the peer-reviewed journals are all based on those lies and
[17:14.000 --> 17:18.760]  there's hundreds of them classic examples in the last decade is there are
[17:18.760 --> 17:23.240]  thousands of buoys in the ocean there are thousands of weather stations and
[17:23.240 --> 17:28.280]  all the United Nations did was go cherry pick the particular buoys and
[17:28.280 --> 17:32.680]  weather stations that did have increases for the year and then only enter that
[17:32.680 --> 17:38.040]  data there's that fraud or they zoom in on the ice core sample record of
[17:38.040 --> 17:44.280]  temperature that is detailed down to it one one thousandth of a degree per year
[17:44.280 --> 17:49.880]  and they go into that and they only zoom in on the last 50 years or so to show
[17:49.880 --> 17:53.360]  an increase we had in the last 50 years that's now declining they don't show you
[17:53.360 --> 17:56.760]  that 50 years before that there was a spike and a hundred years before that a
[17:56.760 --> 18:02.040]  big spike and 200 years before that a giant spike tripling the spike we've
[18:02.040 --> 18:11.040]  seen when people were running around in togas the earth on average was nine
[18:11.040 --> 18:18.040]  degrees hotter oh and forget that you want to go back to the bronze age the
[18:18.040 --> 18:22.240]  beginning of the bronze age 9,000 years ago stuff got hot and so humans could
[18:22.240 --> 18:27.680]  grow more food and weren't just you know on the edge of starvation and there were
[18:27.680 --> 18:32.480]  more animals grazing so it was more to hunt and so that's where we got the
[18:32.480 --> 18:39.840]  beginnings of civilization 9,000 years ago we can really thank the sun for
[18:39.840 --> 18:45.320]  heating up during that period thank you son I mean the ancients knew the source
[18:45.320 --> 18:50.560]  of life that's why they worshipped the sun but the UN said on Monday the sun
[18:50.560 --> 18:56.040]  has no effect on climate that's like saying shooting yourself 15 times in the
[18:56.040 --> 19:02.440]  head with a 12 gauge shotgun won't kill you that's like saying jumping off a
[19:02.440 --> 19:07.520]  5,000 foot cliff without a parachute and falling on to spikes razor blade spikes
[19:07.520 --> 19:11.840]  won't hurt you that's like saying pouring gasoline on yourself and lighting
[19:11.840 --> 19:18.720]  yourself on fire won't hurt that's like saying the Easter Bunny is real I mean
[19:18.720 --> 19:27.080]  it is complete mega fraud mega joke hey how stupid are you out there how you

[24:52.920 --> 24:58.320]  outraged a private group of banks have taken over our governments given
[24:58.320 --> 25:02.200]  themselves the illegitimate criminal power I don't care if they say it's
[25:02.200 --> 25:08.360]  legal Hitler could say that murdering masses of people was legal our nation
[25:08.360 --> 25:14.400]  the courts the Congress once said it was legal to have black people as slaves
[25:14.400 --> 25:21.680]  pulling plows like a mule but in your heart you know that's a fraud so I
[25:21.680 --> 25:26.160]  don't care if the bankers paid off the politicians worldwide to let them issue
[25:26.160 --> 25:32.080]  unlimited currency and credit to all of us they own the money machines they owe
[25:32.080 --> 25:36.080]  the issuance of currency and credit they've taken over the planet now they
[25:36.080 --> 25:44.240]  want to cut off your resources to force you into actual chattel bondage and
[25:44.240 --> 25:52.360]  slavery that is the stated goal the stated operation and of course they
[25:52.360 --> 25:55.720]  can't come out and say we want you to be chattel slaves now they've already
[25:55.720 --> 26:03.200]  bankrupted the world many times over and it's been done by fraud and they've
[26:03.200 --> 26:06.400]  already completely taken over the third world and so they come back and say oh
[26:06.400 --> 26:11.080]  we want to give money to the third world and then you read the treaty it's 30
[26:11.080 --> 26:17.480]  percent compounded interest loans so they tax the west send money to the third
[26:17.480 --> 26:23.360]  world with 30 percent or higher compounded interest and say we won't loan
[26:23.360 --> 26:29.600]  you this money unless you sterilize your people and shut down factories the
[26:29.600 --> 26:36.640]  corrupt dictators and thugs that run the third world cess pits that we're fast
[26:36.640 --> 26:41.240]  becoming because of corruption that's why they can't get up off their feet can't
[26:41.240 --> 26:45.440]  get up off their butts because they're literally under corruption they these
[26:45.440 --> 26:51.200]  countries use corruption as a way to keep control of people they work to keep
[26:51.200 --> 26:55.360]  them poor this has been the stated control system of empires for five
[26:55.360 --> 27:02.480]  thousand years there were books written by the Babylonians books written by the
[27:02.480 --> 27:07.520]  Romans I have read them on how to control people and you don't think the
[27:07.520 --> 27:11.760]  governments do know how to do that today oh we have their current documents
[27:11.760 --> 27:15.920]  where they say they want to wreck the industrial society to make you dependent
[27:15.920 --> 27:22.160]  on them the government doesn't want your tax money they want to own you period
[27:22.160 --> 27:32.360]  they are parasites and right now this is being established right now it's being

[28:23.600 --> 28:27.560]  eastern time and they're saying they're gonna work through the night on this
[28:27.560 --> 28:32.600]  agreement and they want to leave it vague you just they put out a vague
[28:32.600 --> 28:38.120]  agreement the country side on to it and the UN can do whatever they want now

[35:23.800 --> 35:27.880]  we've also are going to be talking about the science behind it
[35:27.880 --> 35:31.240]  and we're also going to be talking about the latest in Copenhagen as open
[35:31.240 --> 35:35.880]  world government is being announced and it looks like established
[35:35.880 --> 35:41.480]  we've got to fight this fraud pierce Corbin is a leading I set out to find
[35:41.480 --> 35:45.880]  someone who is known as a leading meteorologist astrophysicist
[35:45.880 --> 35:51.960]  I mean the degrees go on and on and from all the experts I've talked to and
[35:51.960 --> 35:56.440]  looked at he's one of the top forecasters who has accurately
[35:56.440 --> 36:00.360]  been forecasting weather at levels much more accurate
[36:00.360 --> 36:04.360]  than even governments and NASA and others so he's here to explain to us today
[36:04.360 --> 36:08.840]  how he's been able to do that as well weatheraction.com
[36:08.840 --> 36:14.680]  but Mr. Corbin's the British press calls you Dr. Corbin but it all gets
[36:14.680 --> 36:18.120]  confusing with all these different scientific areas you're an expert in
[36:18.120 --> 36:21.160]  but in a nutshell tell us your main area of study
[36:21.160 --> 36:27.080]  about weather action and then the the fraud of man-made climate change
[36:27.080 --> 36:30.760]  yes well I got a first-class degree from imperial college in physics and then
[36:30.760 --> 36:35.800]  went on and did astrophysics at Queen Mary College in London these are both in
[36:35.800 --> 36:40.680]  London and I developed from that into studying the
[36:40.680 --> 36:44.440]  sun and how the sun affects the earth's weather
[36:44.440 --> 36:48.600]  and after some years of study in all sorts of ideas
[36:48.600 --> 36:53.800]  we developed this method for long-range weather forecasting called the solar
[36:53.800 --> 36:57.560]  weather technique which depends on the
[36:57.560 --> 37:01.880]  magnetic particles coming from the sun and how they
[37:01.880 --> 37:07.880]  change circulation patterns on earth subject to certain modulations such as
[37:07.880 --> 37:11.160]  what the moon is doing as well
[37:11.800 --> 37:16.360]  and it I mean from studying most of the scientists we talk to
[37:16.360 --> 37:20.520]  more and more say the evidence is showing that the sun is one of the main
[37:20.520 --> 37:26.440]  drivers but the UN again on Monday just declared as if they were the pope
[37:26.440 --> 37:29.400]  saying the earth is the center of the universe in flat
[37:29.400 --> 37:32.200]  they announced that the sun has nothing to do with it
[37:32.200 --> 37:36.120]  yes well they would wouldn't they because they have another agenda
[37:36.120 --> 37:40.360]  now we know that what they say is failed science
[37:40.360 --> 37:47.880]  based on fraudulent data and we know from our own measurements and it
[37:47.880 --> 37:51.480]  actually experienced that the sun is the main
[37:51.480 --> 37:57.480]  of the prime driver of all weather change on the on the earth
[37:57.480 --> 38:00.680]  and carbon dioxide has nothing absolutely nothing
[38:00.680 --> 38:06.680]  zero zero influence for whatever reason to do with feedbacks or whatever but it
[38:06.680 --> 38:10.120]  has no influence and am i right doctor saying it is
[38:10.120 --> 38:13.480]  one of the lowest trace gases in the atmosphere
[38:13.480 --> 38:19.000]  that's right yes there's only one part in three thousand
[38:19.000 --> 38:23.720]  of these carbon dioxide now of course they argue all sorts of critical
[38:23.720 --> 38:27.800]  processes but we say well show us the evidence actual
[38:27.800 --> 38:31.880]  observational evidence that carbon dioxide drives temperatures and
[38:31.880 --> 38:35.000]  extreme events and there is none and i was on
[38:35.000 --> 38:39.240]  russian tv a few days ago pointing at somebody from the
[38:39.240 --> 38:43.240]  united nations climate committee the IPCC and said all right if you have the
[38:43.240 --> 38:45.800]  evidence email it to me and i gave him my
[38:45.800 --> 38:49.080]  email address peers at weather action dot com on the air
[38:49.080 --> 38:52.360]  and so far he's emailed nothing and of course he won't because there is no
[38:52.360 --> 38:55.800]  evidence well most of these guys know it's
[38:55.800 --> 38:59.160]  fraud i've talked to a lot of them at events on the street
[38:59.160 --> 39:03.640]  at smart growth conferences and they just off-camera laugh
[39:03.640 --> 39:07.960]  and say yeah and say buddy we're getting rich i mean this is just a band of
[39:07.960 --> 39:12.600]  criminals it is cynical yeah i mean i know some of them you know friends of
[39:12.600 --> 39:15.720]  mine in some sense or they were friends of mine saying well peers you
[39:15.720 --> 39:19.400]  you know i say quite openly you may well be right
[39:19.400 --> 39:24.280]  and they might even say you are right but uh i've got mouths to feed
[39:24.280 --> 39:28.120]  and uh you know they'll go on this this this gravy train for as long as it's
[39:28.120 --> 39:31.720]  there which is a scandalous of course scandalous
[39:31.720 --> 39:35.960]  i mean we believe in weather action that all science
[39:35.960 --> 39:40.040]  and and policy making has to be evidence based
[39:40.040 --> 39:44.040]  and this is is not evidence basis based on fraud and
[39:44.040 --> 39:47.160]  as you mentioned there's been a whole lot of revelations
[39:47.160 --> 39:51.960]  uh coming out of the fraud not just that the University of East Anglia have
[39:51.960 --> 39:56.760]  been meddling with data to make their bizarre little models fit
[39:56.760 --> 40:01.080]  history and rub out the medieval war period but we now know for example in
[40:01.080 --> 40:05.000]  New Zealand data was chosen so that although the real
[40:05.000 --> 40:10.840]  data showed a falling of temperatures of 0.7 degrees centigrade per
[40:10.840 --> 40:14.200]  century they fitted it to turn it into a rising
[40:14.200 --> 40:19.880]  of 1.2 degrees per century and and we now know that in Russia
[40:19.880 --> 40:24.600]  they uh uh selected uh Russian weather stations to
[40:24.600 --> 40:28.360]  choose the ones which were nearest to what they wanted so they threw away
[40:28.360 --> 40:34.760]  75 of the Russian data and the Russians nicely announced this
[40:34.760 --> 40:38.600]  a few days ago uh at the same time as a cold blast of air
[40:38.600 --> 40:43.960]  whacked through Copenhagen uh to England uh bringing blizzards on the way at
[40:43.960 --> 40:48.280]  the same time as as Obama landed and we in fact a
[40:48.280 --> 40:51.800]  weather action had forecasted just these blizzards
[40:51.800 --> 40:56.360]  uh from uh in detail from 30 days ahead although the general ideas we often
[40:56.360 --> 40:59.880]  forecast from longer ahead now one of their favorite tricks is you have
[40:59.880 --> 41:03.320]  hundreds of thousands of different sub-weather systems according to what
[41:03.320 --> 41:06.680]  i've read correctly if i'm wrong and they will just pick
[41:06.680 --> 41:10.120]  one little area that's having extreme weather but you're always
[41:10.120 --> 41:13.640]  out of thousands of different areas going to be able to find a few areas
[41:13.640 --> 41:16.280]  that are having extreme weather that is normal
[41:16.280 --> 41:19.800]  absolutely yes you see because you know every
[41:19.800 --> 41:23.080]  town and city has got a maximum a minimum of wet
[41:23.080 --> 41:26.200]  uh you know an amount of rainfall amount of sunshine and so on so you go
[41:26.200 --> 41:30.120]  around the world in any year or month you can find somebody who's got an
[41:30.120 --> 41:34.760]  extreme and you can announce it which of course isn't just nonsense
[41:34.760 --> 41:38.600]  whereas a weather action from a long time ahead we can announce
[41:38.600 --> 41:42.760]  periods very short periods around the world where there will be
[41:42.760 --> 41:47.080]  a whole lot of simultaneous more or less simultaneous
[41:47.080 --> 41:51.720]  weather extreme events which happened for example from the 17th to 19th of
[41:51.720 --> 41:55.480]  November this year there were enormous storms and delugees not
[41:55.480 --> 42:00.360]  knowing in the USA in Africa, India, Australia and
[42:00.360 --> 42:04.840]  Europe and we've predicted those a long time ahead
[42:04.840 --> 42:08.680]  so you know there are real extremes going on and those type of things they
[42:08.680 --> 42:12.680]  cannot predict all they can do later after funding is they all
[42:12.680 --> 42:16.520]  there's an extreme that must be COP shifting gears with appears Corbin
[42:16.520 --> 42:19.560]  shifting gears sir why have you been so accurate
[42:19.560 --> 42:24.040]  with long-term forecasting at weatheraction.com
[42:24.040 --> 42:28.040]  well the reason why we're accurate is because we understand
[42:28.040 --> 42:33.240]  the essential nature of the magnetic and particle relationship
[42:33.240 --> 42:38.600]  which drives the earth's weather and climate
[42:38.600 --> 42:44.360]  now obviously it's vastly complicated so we don't have supercomputers to do it
[42:44.360 --> 42:48.280]  or models which just like financial models would go wrong
[42:48.280 --> 42:52.920]  what we're able to do is understanding the periods of the forcing factors and
[42:52.920 --> 42:57.960]  the changing forcing factors is we can identify when in the past
[42:57.960 --> 43:02.840]  there were very similar some of magnetic forcing factors
[43:02.840 --> 43:07.080]  affecting the world as there will be at some time in the future
[43:07.080 --> 43:10.760]  so by knowing the past you know the future understanding the science
[43:10.760 --> 43:15.160]  exactly the the point we make is there's nothing new happening
[43:15.160 --> 43:17.960]  all the weather you see now has happened before sometime
[43:17.960 --> 43:21.720]  we just have identified when in the past is going to be very similar to
[43:21.720 --> 43:26.760]  sometime in the future honey it might be 40 years ago might be 100 years ago
[43:26.760 --> 43:31.880]  but we have ways which are quite mathematically clever of finding
[43:31.880 --> 43:36.280]  finding out have you read about john have you read about john p
[43:36.280 --> 43:39.880]  Holdren the white house science are who's also involved in the climate gate
[43:39.880 --> 43:43.640]  emails see he says they're going to save us
[43:43.640 --> 43:46.840]  i mean they're always saving us from something new he says with
[43:46.840 --> 43:50.920]  geoengineering or terra farming he says they're
[43:50.920 --> 43:55.320]  doing tests to manipulate the weather the russians the chinese they all claim
[43:55.320 --> 43:58.360]  they can control the weather in your modeling i know you're
[43:58.360 --> 44:03.240]  looking at the entire planet the sun the particles the nuclei coming in from
[44:03.240 --> 44:06.920]  space but do you ever see anything weird going on
[44:06.920 --> 44:11.160]  because of some of the weather modification testing well
[44:11.160 --> 44:18.200]  very difficult to know um you see uh i if they could really control the
[44:18.200 --> 44:21.800]  weather i don't think that allow blizzard to happen when obama landed in
[44:21.800 --> 44:27.000]  Copenhagen so it certainly couldn't be couldn't be that that good but um
[44:27.000 --> 44:32.120]  i do i'm aware of these things that uh are they are doing experiments with and
[44:32.120 --> 44:37.400]  i know some things do work to an extent now there's a curious little story
[44:37.400 --> 44:42.840]  about what happened in china recently uh because in this period the 17th to 19th
[44:42.840 --> 44:47.080]  of of november uh which we had predicted would be a lot
[44:47.080 --> 44:53.080]  of extreme weather in china there was uh
[44:53.080 --> 44:56.040]  well the chinese reported three million people
[44:56.040 --> 44:59.720]  would had to be moved out of the homes because of
[44:59.720 --> 45:05.320]  absolutely massive snowstorms and there was also a story around that
[45:05.320 --> 45:09.080]  although there may have been natural processes going on that they were also
[45:09.080 --> 45:13.800]  cloud seeding at the same time or just before and it had made these worse
[45:13.800 --> 45:18.280]  now the problem is of course we've got no way of verifying this because the
[45:18.280 --> 45:21.640]  chinese government aren't going to say that they did this which resulted in
[45:21.640 --> 45:25.160]  32 people dying when some buildings collapsed
[45:25.160 --> 45:28.840]  uh but we do know as well there were very real events around the world which
[45:28.840 --> 45:33.240]  we predicted a long time ahead well uh and they're based on looking back in
[45:33.240 --> 45:38.040]  the past so there's no way that they could have anyone knew what we were
[45:38.040 --> 45:41.240]  saying anyway so well i tend to agree with you because i've talked to ben
[45:41.240 --> 45:43.960]  livingston the father of weather weapons and others
[45:43.960 --> 45:48.040]  and he said they can with the right conditions they could make a hurricane
[45:48.040 --> 45:52.040]  they could strengthen one or weaken one but he said that when the giant
[45:52.040 --> 45:56.120]  weather system is coming in that it's so huge
[45:56.120 --> 45:59.560]  that it's hard to control but he says in smaller areas
[45:59.560 --> 46:02.840]  they can manipulate things and and and i would know
[46:02.840 --> 46:07.160]  well the rush has got to have the situation there already to like be
[46:07.160 --> 46:13.400]  triggered i would have thought yes absolutely but but on top of that
[46:13.400 --> 46:17.480]  it isn't that they couldn't knock out a smaller snowstorm the russians brag they
[46:17.480 --> 46:20.120]  can do that it's that if you've got a giant
[46:20.120 --> 46:23.560]  northern blast coming in it would be too big for them to manipulate
[46:23.560 --> 46:27.400]  oh sure i'm no doubt that they i'm sure it can't be done and
[46:27.400 --> 46:32.440]  and uh well i say never will be done but be careful about never these days you
[46:32.440 --> 46:36.440]  just don't know what's possible but you know the summer of
[46:36.440 --> 46:42.200]  lunar system is vastly more powerful than anything man can mobilize
[46:42.200 --> 46:46.280]  but of course if man can play at the critical ages when something is tipping
[46:46.280 --> 46:50.520]  one by the other then there are possibilities but they only work at
[46:50.520 --> 46:54.120]  those times and those times occur due to natural processes
[46:54.120 --> 46:57.720]  so any control is only limited to certain
[46:57.720 --> 47:02.280]  certain sensitive areas such as when our solar weather impact periods are
[47:02.280 --> 47:04.520]  happening and those are very definitely
[47:04.520 --> 47:07.480]  serious so what is going on with the sun right now
[47:07.480 --> 47:11.240]  i mean why has it been why have we been cooling for nine years
[47:11.240 --> 47:15.000]  we've been cooling for nine years are essentially
[47:15.000 --> 47:21.880]  because of the uh well the decline in solar activity and it being
[47:21.880 --> 47:27.000]  a odd sunspot cycle we're just leaving and at the
[47:27.000 --> 47:31.640]  the when that happens in an odd sunspot cycle you will get less
[47:31.640 --> 47:36.120]  less warming um we're also in the situation where the
[47:36.120 --> 47:43.640]  effect of the moon is to uh limit the effect of of of of
[47:43.640 --> 47:48.200]  particles which are which would cause warming um
[47:48.200 --> 47:52.840]  when you get into an even cycle things change and in fact even cycles are
[47:52.840 --> 47:58.360]  generally colder than odd cycles and we're now entering an even cycle
[47:58.360 --> 48:02.120]  sir what would i mean as a leading astrophysicist
[48:07.320 --> 48:09.880]  sure i mean as a leading astrophysicist and
[48:09.880 --> 48:13.560]  someone who studies the the entire earth sun moon
[48:13.560 --> 48:19.880]  relationship what type of cycle or or what area of the cycle were we in
[48:19.880 --> 48:25.240]  9 000 years ago when the warming was according to the graphs i've seen
[48:25.240 --> 48:28.680]  much hotter than it's been in the last century
[48:28.680 --> 48:32.440]  right well to be specific we'd have to look
[48:32.440 --> 48:37.080]  carefully but the the world temperature will depend on the
[48:37.080 --> 48:41.960]  solar activity and how well that activity actually reaches earth which is
[48:41.960 --> 48:46.280]  about magnetic connectivity and that is going to be affected
[48:46.280 --> 48:49.800]  not just by the 22 year magnetic cycle of the sun
[48:49.800 --> 48:53.400]  but also by their close orientation of the
[48:53.400 --> 48:59.560]  the axis relative to the sun uh magnetic axis so there's that question
[48:59.560 --> 49:03.480]  there's a question of the solar lunar things and then there's a question of
[49:03.480 --> 49:08.200]  the slow cycles of general solar activity which are
[49:08.200 --> 49:11.640]  they're not just operating on the scale of 11 years or so but
[49:11.640 --> 49:15.880]  uh on hundreds of years if not many hundreds of years
[49:15.880 --> 49:19.640]  so it's going to be all those combinations of the solar activity
[49:19.640 --> 49:27.240]  lunar modulations and um uh orientation so i couldn't be specific
[49:27.240 --> 49:32.440]  exactly to say but uh we could we should in principally be able to predict
[49:32.440 --> 49:37.000]  when in the future similar things could will happen again
[49:37.000 --> 49:40.360]  when will we have something uh close to
[49:40.360 --> 49:44.200]  what happened during the beginning of the bronze age i mean the heat up
[49:44.200 --> 49:48.040]  maybe never because you see sometime there's got to be
[49:48.040 --> 49:53.800]  a return to an ice age the the natural state of the world for the last few
[49:53.800 --> 49:57.960]  million years is ice ages but with intermittent warm periods the
[49:57.960 --> 50:02.680]  lasting you know typically 10 000 years which we're in now and we are
[50:02.680 --> 50:06.120]  you know in year 10 000 now so logically
[50:06.120 --> 50:11.720]  there is a ice age due now it might have been that was almost an ice age
[50:11.720 --> 50:17.080]  coming uh uh at about zero ad because you know since then or
[50:17.080 --> 50:24.360]  1000 ad since then it has been uh uh uh notably colder but we don't know
[50:24.360 --> 50:28.200]  what what we can say about the next 100 years is according to
[50:28.200 --> 50:33.000]  our our theory and i don't like using the word model because we
[50:33.000 --> 50:37.160]  you know it is we base it on observations and equations rather than
[50:37.160 --> 50:41.320]  playing games as computers although we do use computers of course our theory
[50:41.320 --> 50:46.600]  shows that uh uh we're in for a continuing general cooling

[54:14.280 --> 54:17.400]  to talk more about what an ice age would look like
[54:17.400 --> 54:22.280]  just 200 miles north of me is where in the last ice age the main glacier ended
[54:22.280 --> 54:26.840]  in southern oklahoma up in oklahoma you just see giant boulders out in the
[54:26.840 --> 54:29.480]  middle of flat fields brought thereby
[54:29.480 --> 54:35.000]  several hundred foot thick glaciers and uh all the evidence all the real
[54:35.000 --> 54:38.920]  science what governments really believe is we're going into an ice age
[54:38.920 --> 54:43.080]  they fraudulently chose warming uh because they believe that would scare
[54:43.080 --> 54:46.120]  the public better and people wouldn't believe an ice age was coming
[54:46.120 --> 54:50.440]  they know it's a fraud it's a sick cynical joke so our guest is coming up
[54:50.440 --> 54:54.200]  with us more in the next hour we'll talk about the scientific fraud
[54:54.200 --> 54:57.240]  climate gates some of the other frauds that haven't been as well
[54:57.240 --> 55:03.320]  publicized before i do that ups can still ship to most areas of the

[56:25.880 --> 56:29.560]  okay this is a short segment going back to our guest uh finishing up with one of
[56:29.560 --> 56:33.480]  the leading appears corbin heads up weather action dot com a
[56:33.480 --> 56:37.480]  astrophysicist meteorologist his forecast for my research are
[56:37.480 --> 56:41.240]  among some of the most accurate out there years ahead
[56:41.240 --> 56:44.520]  and he does this by knowing that history those that don't know
[56:44.520 --> 56:48.600]  history are doomed to repeat it i believe lord acton said that or did he say
[56:48.600 --> 56:52.520]  power corrupts absolute power crops absolutely he said a lot of things i
[56:52.520 --> 56:55.160]  think yeah exactly we've got a few minutes left here we're
[56:55.160 --> 56:58.440]  going to come back with some longer segments specifically
[56:58.440 --> 57:02.920]  i understand the ice age is 100 200 400 500 we just know we're due for another
[57:02.920 --> 57:08.040]  one we're going into a cooling trend now what would an ice age look like
[57:08.040 --> 57:12.440]  well uh they take about a couple of thousand years to develop fully but
[57:12.440 --> 57:16.440]  what happens is the ice caps in both hemispheres would
[57:16.440 --> 57:19.560]  increase in size and it just gets progressively
[57:19.560 --> 57:26.360]  colder and the sea freezes over uh in the in the uh polar regions under
[57:26.360 --> 57:31.080]  it all just makes the uh you know moves moves towards the the equator
[57:31.080 --> 57:35.320]  so typically across the uh united states of america you'd have a
[57:35.320 --> 57:40.040]  uh an ice front you know and an ice cap will extend there
[57:40.040 --> 57:43.720]  and in the case of the last ice age in britain it went
[57:43.720 --> 57:47.400]  through the middle of britain so the south of england was actually
[57:47.400 --> 57:51.080]  ice not ice and the scotland and the whole of
[57:51.080 --> 57:55.000]  northern england and most of island was covered in ice
[57:55.000 --> 57:58.840]  and you could walk to europe and the whole of russia would have been
[57:58.840 --> 58:03.720]  covered in ice and scandinavia covered in ice so if an ice age comes all those
[58:03.720 --> 58:09.080]  people would come back so all the canadian scandinavians and russians
[58:09.080 --> 58:12.840]  would all come back or else they'd find ways of
[58:12.840 --> 58:16.280]  overcoming this by building things on the ice which is
[58:16.280 --> 58:19.960]  was there was there a more ancient ice age
[58:19.960 --> 58:24.440]  i mean because i know that the ice came all the way down to texas
[58:24.440 --> 58:28.920]  so bigger smaller ice ages it came down further than the last one that is
[58:28.920 --> 58:32.760]  that is is correct um they've been different sizes when they
[58:32.760 --> 58:38.760]  happened typically every 100,000 years or 90,000 years or 120,000 years
[58:38.760 --> 58:42.120]  all right let me ride back back in one minute

[1:00:11.240 --> 1:00:18.520]  you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the gcn radio network
[1:00:18.520 --> 1:00:25.080]  and now live from austin texas alex jones
[1:00:26.360 --> 1:00:31.480]  well the next 20 minutes or so we have a preeminent astrophysicist
[1:00:31.480 --> 1:00:39.880]  meteorologist pierce corbin
[1:00:39.880 --> 1:00:44.040]  weatheraction.com
[1:00:44.040 --> 1:00:47.320]  and we appreciate him joining us okay in the two segments we've got left the
[1:00:47.320 --> 1:00:52.840]  short one and the longer one coming up uh specifically uh the fraud of the
[1:00:52.840 --> 1:00:56.200]  scientist i mean you see him you're in england you're around them but
[1:00:56.200 --> 1:01:00.520]  this is exposed fraud throughout the united nation system where they went
[1:01:00.520 --> 1:01:03.960]  out and recruited those documents are now public for those that don't know
[1:01:03.960 --> 1:01:08.040]  yeah and and and created a premeditated fraud
[1:01:08.040 --> 1:01:12.360]  yeah well as a scientist i find it utterly
[1:01:12.360 --> 1:01:16.440]  reprehensible and i'm astounded by the the depth of it
[1:01:16.440 --> 1:01:20.200]  you know just choosing data sets in new zealand and russia
[1:01:20.200 --> 1:01:27.560]  just meddling with parameters to adjust actual measured data or losing
[1:01:27.560 --> 1:01:31.720]  actual measured data when they produce their so-called world forecast
[1:01:31.720 --> 1:01:35.400]  i mean as far as we're concerned not world focus world data set
[1:01:35.400 --> 1:01:40.680]  as far as we're concerned the uh data set produced for the world by the
[1:01:40.680 --> 1:01:44.520]  climate research unit of the university of east anglia is rubbish and we're
[1:01:44.520 --> 1:01:48.280]  never going to use it again we're instead going to try and use
[1:01:48.280 --> 1:01:52.280]  satellite data and work with other scientists around the world in order to
[1:01:52.280 --> 1:01:55.880]  try and develop a accurate data set of what happened
[1:01:55.880 --> 1:01:59.320]  in the past which would improve our long-range
[1:01:59.320 --> 1:02:03.160]  forecast of climate and if anything of course it would make our projections of
[1:02:03.160 --> 1:02:07.000]  cooling to even more cooling
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:10.280]  what does this do what should be done with the scientists i think all those
[1:02:10.280 --> 1:02:13.800]  involved in this fraudulent activity should be sacked
[1:02:13.800 --> 1:02:18.280]  and we have to demand that governments do accountable
[1:02:18.280 --> 1:02:22.360]  and evidence-based science and policy making
[1:02:22.360 --> 1:02:26.120]  by accountable their data needs to be public i mean that was the big red flag
[1:02:26.120 --> 1:02:29.960]  from the east anglia facility is that they wouldn't ever let anybody see
[1:02:29.960 --> 1:02:33.000]  their raw data now they destroyed the data they say they're going to give us
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:37.000]  cover up yeah that they yeah that's right yeah some of the data was available
[1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:42.520]  but they they they had these computer codes which they used to allow for
[1:02:42.520 --> 1:02:46.200]  various things as they put it to make it more
[1:02:46.200 --> 1:02:49.880]  accurate well actually of course they were doing the opposite which is why
[1:02:49.880 --> 1:02:54.040]  they didn't want to show what they were up to
[1:02:54.040 --> 1:02:57.400]  and we should take our hats off to the guys who released it
[1:02:57.400 --> 1:03:01.240]  however i think it's quite likely it was actually an inside job and they were
[1:03:01.240 --> 1:03:04.520]  releasing the data in the manner they had
[1:03:04.520 --> 1:03:09.160]  in order to try and say that it isn't accurate and can't be trusted because if
[1:03:09.160 --> 1:03:12.280]  they had have released it under the freedom of information act then we
[1:03:12.280 --> 1:03:14.920]  would have been able to quiz these guys directly
[1:03:14.920 --> 1:03:18.120]  instead one of them has stepped down for the time being so he can't be asked
[1:03:18.120 --> 1:03:21.400]  anything so i'm very suspicious of the whole
[1:03:21.400 --> 1:03:25.080]  thing but you know it is now clear that it is
[1:03:25.080 --> 1:03:29.960]  failed science based on fraudulent data and this fraud has been
[1:03:29.960 --> 1:03:34.040]  activated around the whole world well the world's
[1:03:34.040 --> 1:03:37.720]  climate system as you know but for the audience who may not is so incredibly
[1:03:37.720 --> 1:03:41.400]  complex that not even supercomputers can even begin to grasp but that's why you
[1:03:41.400 --> 1:03:45.640]  can only look at past systems just to understand trends
[1:03:45.640 --> 1:03:48.600]  to forecast because i mean here's the christian science monitor
[1:03:48.600 --> 1:03:53.320]  philippines force evacuation as volcano eruption threatens
[1:03:53.320 --> 1:03:59.000]  the cities and i mean this thing is putting off more carbon dioxide
[1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:02.760]  than hundreds of cities will do in a decade they admit that
[1:04:02.760 --> 1:04:06.280]  but then of course this carbon dioxide and soot and the rest of it
[1:04:06.280 --> 1:04:09.640]  the forecasters are saying will not have a
[1:04:09.640 --> 1:04:12.440]  heating effect it will have a cooling effect
[1:04:12.440 --> 1:04:16.360]  yes well of course they've got a few problems there haven't they the dust
[1:04:16.360 --> 1:04:20.280]  indeed does does does make a a cooling effect but
[1:04:20.280 --> 1:04:23.320]  there's many contradictions and of course there's a lot of things going on
[1:04:23.320 --> 1:04:26.040]  which they don't know about i mean there's a lot of
[1:04:26.040 --> 1:04:29.880]  undersea volcanoes doing a lot of things to the sea
[1:04:29.880 --> 1:04:33.800]  for example and the the role of volcanoes maybe
[1:04:33.800 --> 1:04:37.320]  is little understood but we are understanding more about the summer
[1:04:37.320 --> 1:04:41.000]  as we know very clearly as i said before that co2 has
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:46.680]  no effect no net effect and if anything it's temperatures that drives co2 levels
[1:04:46.680 --> 1:04:50.760]  and we've got huge volcanoes a giant sun radiating us
[1:04:50.760 --> 1:04:55.240]  all these other cosmic rays coming in forming nuclei that form clouds
[1:04:55.240 --> 1:04:59.000]  meanwhile some tiny trace gas that's precious to plants
[1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:03.640]  is being listed as a chemical weapon this is alex jones with five good reasons
[1:05:03.640 --> 1:05:06.120]  you should consider buying a solar power generator
[1:05:06.120 --> 1:05:10.040]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[1:05:10.040 --> 1:05:12.920]  bill number two our new energies are wants to
[1:05:12.920 --> 1:05:16.200]  control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[1:05:16.200 --> 1:05:20.440]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[1:05:20.440 --> 1:05:24.040]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country
[1:05:24.040 --> 1:05:28.520]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[1:05:28.520 --> 1:05:32.360]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[1:05:32.360 --> 1:05:35.560]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[1:05:35.560 --> 1:05:39.480]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[1:05:39.480 --> 1:05:42.280]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[1:05:42.280 --> 1:05:45.400]  folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[1:05:45.400 --> 1:05:48.120]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more
[1:05:48.120 --> 1:05:51.560]  information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[1:05:51.560 --> 1:05:55.640]  that's mysolarbackup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun
[1:05:55.640 --> 1:06:03.240]  so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365
[1:06:03.240 --> 1:06:06.440]  hi folks this is alex jones and i want to tell you about the silver lungs
[1:06:06.440 --> 1:06:09.800]  generator now you can produce pure and endless colloidal
[1:06:09.800 --> 1:06:13.400]  silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream
[1:06:13.400 --> 1:06:17.320]  by breathing the solution through the lungs the respiratory system is the
[1:06:17.320 --> 1:06:20.680]  first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses
[1:06:20.680 --> 1:06:24.040]  the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system
[1:06:24.040 --> 1:06:28.520]  with your self-produced nano silver solutions and also delivers
[1:06:28.520 --> 1:06:32.120]  the silver nano particles instantly into the bloodstream
[1:06:32.120 --> 1:06:36.200]  with continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products
[1:06:36.200 --> 1:06:39.720]  you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[1:06:39.720 --> 1:06:44.200]  with the silver lungs generator very easy to follow step by step instructions
[1:06:44.200 --> 1:06:47.080]  are provided making production fast and simple

[1:06:52.440 --> 1:06:59.480]  technology of the silver lungs generator that's www.silverlungs.com
[1:07:02.440 --> 1:07:06.440]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[1:07:06.440 --> 1:07:09.640]  this is our last chance to not relive history
[1:07:09.640 --> 1:07:13.640]  as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath
[1:07:13.640 --> 1:07:17.720]  Americans at home i've turned a tremendous influence on our president
[1:07:17.720 --> 1:07:20.840]  in congress and they really are calling the shots
[1:07:20.840 --> 1:07:26.040]  i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[1:07:26.040 --> 1:07:30.040]  full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[1:07:30.040 --> 1:07:33.720]  offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty
[1:07:33.720 --> 1:07:37.000]  and on its ashes constructing world government tim geithner
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:40.760]  Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress is
[1:07:40.760 --> 1:07:44.680]  saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care
[1:07:44.680 --> 1:07:48.200]  and right now in washington dc we have seen
[1:07:48.200 --> 1:07:51.960]  a fall of the republic get your copy of fall of the republic
[1:07:51.960 --> 1:07:57.160]  on dvd at info wars dot com we're watching online right now in super
[1:07:57.160 --> 1:08:01.720]  high quality at prisonplanet.tv
[1:08:03.480 --> 1:08:07.560]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines
[1:08:07.560 --> 1:08:11.320]  the information war continues it's alex jones
[1:08:11.320 --> 1:08:17.320]  and the gcn radio network here's carbon is a world-renowned british
[1:08:17.320 --> 1:08:21.720]  weather forecaster and consultant an owner of the business weather action
[1:08:21.720 --> 1:08:26.040]  which makes weather forecast up to a year in advance
[1:08:26.040 --> 1:08:32.120]  and uh has one of the most accurate track records out there weather action
[1:08:32.120 --> 1:08:36.120]  dot com and uh he's not just breaking down climate
[1:08:36.120 --> 1:08:39.000]  gate or Copenhagen before he leaves us at the end of the segment he's going to
[1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:42.200]  give us his forecast in the next few months for extreme
[1:08:42.200 --> 1:08:45.880]  weather around the world and into the next year and you can
[1:08:45.880 --> 1:08:50.440]  write it down and check on it later or go to his site and subscribe
[1:08:50.440 --> 1:08:54.360]  to get more detailed weather forecast in your area long-term
[1:08:54.360 --> 1:08:58.440]  weather forecasting from weatheraction dot com
[1:08:58.440 --> 1:09:01.560]  and of course he did predict more than a decade ago the cooling trend and that's
[1:09:01.560 --> 1:09:08.680]  now begun but going back to pierce corbin astrophysicist meteorologist
[1:09:08.680 --> 1:09:13.640]  the list goes on and on sir the mindset of these people you've
[1:09:13.640 --> 1:09:16.920]  been persecuted by him demonized anyone else that
[1:09:16.920 --> 1:09:20.920]  dr tim ball got death threats i could barely get him to be interviewed for my
[1:09:20.920 --> 1:09:26.120]  film follow the republic people get persecuted people
[1:09:26.120 --> 1:09:29.320]  are are i mean these are very dangerous folks
[1:09:29.320 --> 1:09:33.880]  why are they doing it well they're they're motive is if they're telling
[1:09:33.880 --> 1:09:37.480]  lies there must be a reason because if we know the climate
[1:09:37.480 --> 1:09:41.800]  thing is a fraud well what we think they want to do and it is pretty clear is
[1:09:41.800 --> 1:09:45.000]  they want to create another bubble of false value
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:49.960]  using carbon trading which is now worth hundreds of billions of pounds a year
[1:09:49.960 --> 1:09:54.600]  um and through this they hope to control the world economy
[1:09:54.600 --> 1:09:59.400]  uh... hold back uh... development of uh... under underdeveloped countries uh...
[1:09:59.400 --> 1:10:04.520]  and uh... keep up food prices high by burning food and is biofuels and which
[1:10:04.520 --> 1:10:07.640]  is a death sentence which is a death sentence
[1:10:07.640 --> 1:10:12.040]  well of course it is it is in the group the result of their policies is causing
[1:10:12.040 --> 1:10:16.680]  starvation of food rights in a a number of countries
[1:10:16.680 --> 1:10:20.200]  and it's also causing a claim they're trying to
[1:10:20.200 --> 1:10:25.240]  build jobs in a low carbon economy but in britain we've got an example where
[1:10:25.240 --> 1:10:29.880]  a steelworks in northern england at a place called red car is closing
[1:10:29.880 --> 1:10:34.280]  because tatter steel who own it are getting a handout
[1:10:34.280 --> 1:10:38.600]  for reducing carbon emissions in england and at the same time they're getting
[1:10:38.600 --> 1:10:42.520]  another handout for building so-called clean steelworks
[1:10:42.520 --> 1:10:45.720]  in india so they're taking two billion quid
[1:10:45.720 --> 1:10:50.680]  uh... two billion dollars and uh... making a one thousand seven hundred
[1:10:50.680 --> 1:10:55.080]  workers in britain redundant and uh... low and behold the uh...
[1:10:55.080 --> 1:10:59.560]  interesting to notice that the um... director of the tatter steel
[1:10:59.560 --> 1:11:02.600]  energy research institute is doctor patrick right
[1:11:02.600 --> 1:11:08.280]  who is also chair of the united nations uh... i p c c i e their panel on
[1:11:08.280 --> 1:11:12.440]  climate change which is promoting you know the credit scheme for those that
[1:11:12.440 --> 1:11:15.560]  don't recognize the name he's the guy that looks like a summer bin laden
[1:11:15.560 --> 1:11:17.960]  uh...
[1:11:17.960 --> 1:11:23.480]  yes that's the one so so expanding on this to put this in layman's terms
[1:11:23.480 --> 1:11:27.400]  a group of crooks are in there using taxpayer money
[1:11:27.400 --> 1:11:34.280]  to move what's left of western industry to third world areas where they control
[1:11:34.280 --> 1:11:38.840]  the population and have slave wages it's all cold-blooded it's like
[1:11:38.840 --> 1:11:42.440]  it's like al gore's occidental petroleum that he controls
[1:11:42.440 --> 1:11:45.720]  being one of the worst violators of the rainforest
[1:11:45.720 --> 1:11:49.080]  and uh... things that are you know actually can be registered as some type
[1:11:49.080 --> 1:11:53.080]  of environmental loss even though it can be regenerated the point is
[1:11:53.080 --> 1:11:57.640]  is that i've always noticed like morris they are the biggest polluters
[1:11:57.640 --> 1:12:00.760]  uh... it's just utterly sick
[1:12:00.760 --> 1:12:04.280]  uh... how they get away with this and and here's another example
[1:12:04.280 --> 1:12:08.600]  of the fifty billion get given to general motors eleven million was spent to
[1:12:08.600 --> 1:12:14.520]  create green factories for quote uh... of the these uh... these are better cars
[1:12:14.520 --> 1:12:18.200]  in eastern europe in china and brazil
[1:12:18.200 --> 1:12:24.120]  u.s. taxpayers paid to have our factory shut down and moved overseas
[1:12:24.120 --> 1:12:28.120]  yeah it's monstrous it's monstrous and of course the consequence in
[1:12:28.120 --> 1:12:32.040]  in uh... american britain is that wages are going to be forced down and living
[1:12:32.040 --> 1:12:35.320]  standards are forced down and the people that are running this whole show
[1:12:35.320 --> 1:12:39.880]  patter steel and their sidekicks uh... get rich
[1:12:39.880 --> 1:12:45.080]  at the expense of uh... well everywhere the fraud is so incredible i mean
[1:12:45.080 --> 1:12:49.960]  what we just stated is the cold hard facts and my mind can't believe it
[1:12:49.960 --> 1:12:54.040]  because it's just such it's we're paying taxes
[1:12:54.040 --> 1:12:59.480]  to have our factory shut yeah that's exactly right it's mad it's complete
[1:12:59.480 --> 1:13:03.320]  madness and you see some of the politicians probably believe they're
[1:13:03.320 --> 1:13:06.840]  saving the planet but uh... i hope that with climate
[1:13:06.840 --> 1:13:11.240]  gate they will realize actually it's a fraud just like when tony blare had
[1:13:11.240 --> 1:13:15.560]  these had his war in iraq along with with with bush i mean they made up
[1:13:15.560 --> 1:13:19.960]  stories to justify it and they believe that any story was good because they
[1:13:19.960 --> 1:13:24.600]  were doing is right now some of them believe that for this but in the case
[1:13:24.600 --> 1:13:27.560]  of britain a lot of politicians now realize they were tricks and they don't
[1:13:27.560 --> 1:13:32.040]  like it and it may happen this time that a lot of politicians will realize
[1:13:32.040 --> 1:13:36.680]  now that this is a fraud and uh... we'll see things change around the world i
[1:13:36.680 --> 1:13:40.840]  think in the coming coming gear but it won't happen by itself we have to fight
[1:13:40.840 --> 1:13:41.640]  for it
[1:13:41.640 --> 1:13:45.240]  well i agree with you this is devastating to them because now all the
[1:13:45.240 --> 1:13:50.280]  previous hockey stick frauds from man and and santers fraud
[1:13:50.280 --> 1:13:54.040]  i'm just removing from the u n zone report that man wasn't
[1:13:54.040 --> 1:13:58.200]  i mean we knew about that at the time but i was kind of gobsmacked and
[1:13:58.200 --> 1:14:01.400]  however when we talked about it no one believed us you know
[1:14:01.400 --> 1:14:05.560]  it's just uh but now because of some people have been working hard on it
[1:14:05.560 --> 1:14:10.440]  it's come out that's a good term god smacked
[1:14:10.440 --> 1:14:14.200]  no i mean that's how i feel every day it's it's just they're just open criminals
[1:14:14.200 --> 1:14:17.800]  running around stealing engaged in every form of mischief
[1:14:17.800 --> 1:14:21.000]  and instead of them all being arrested they're running the planet
[1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:24.600]  well that's right but we're saying very clearly the scientist involved in this
[1:14:24.600 --> 1:14:28.440]  fraud should be sacked from their jobs and arrested too i mean where there's
[1:14:28.440 --> 1:14:31.720]  you know clearly well you can prove which individuals have done what they
[1:14:31.720 --> 1:14:34.280]  should they're stealing hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayer
[1:14:34.280 --> 1:14:37.480]  research funds correct correct for quackery
[1:14:37.480 --> 1:14:41.800]  speaking of funds you're not funded by big corporations or no we are not we
[1:14:41.800 --> 1:14:45.400]  receive nothing from governments and you can understand why
[1:14:45.400 --> 1:14:49.320]  um we do receive money from farmers and generally
[1:14:49.320 --> 1:14:55.080]  uh small businesses and sometimes a lot larger businesses but uh there's a
[1:14:55.080 --> 1:15:00.040]  recession so we don't get much of it we're extremely uh short of short of
[1:15:00.040 --> 1:15:03.400]  money we have a small workforce that works
[1:15:03.400 --> 1:15:07.320]  very hard for what we do and farmers appreciate us but farmers aren't aren't
[1:15:07.320 --> 1:15:11.160]  well off so you know anyone who wants to buy anything from us just
[1:15:11.160 --> 1:15:14.280]  whack onto our website or of course you can also give
[1:15:14.280 --> 1:15:18.680]  donations and i'm i'm about to give you some forecasting for the usa and
[1:15:18.680 --> 1:15:20.920]  canada till december which we're giving you
[1:15:20.920 --> 1:15:24.200]  free although normally we do charge for it but you know it's
[1:15:24.200 --> 1:15:27.400]  important stuff happening so absolutely people can go and get great
[1:15:27.400 --> 1:15:30.600]  inexpensive uh what have been proven to be very
[1:15:30.600 --> 1:15:34.040]  accurate nothing's perfect but compared to others very accurate
[1:15:34.040 --> 1:15:39.000]  uh there on the website weatheraction.com one word weatheraction.com
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:42.200]  okay in the last five minutes we've got sir give us your forecast
[1:15:42.200 --> 1:15:45.480]  yes important things happening uh in the last
[1:15:45.480 --> 1:15:50.360]  part uh the closing the last third of uh of december
[1:15:50.360 --> 1:15:55.320]  basically between the 19th and 31st there's going to be a series of waves of
[1:15:55.320 --> 1:15:58.520]  severe and at times dangerous and wintry
[1:15:58.520 --> 1:16:02.200]  wintery weather both in the usa and canada
[1:16:02.200 --> 1:16:07.800]  and the main periods are going to be the 19th to 20th and there's a lot of them
[1:16:07.800 --> 1:16:13.000]  22nd to 23rd 25th to 27th over christmas so keep
[1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:17.240]  you indoors and the 28th to the 30th now that is
[1:16:17.240 --> 1:16:22.200]  especially uh extreme and could involve uh storms as
[1:16:22.200 --> 1:16:25.240]  extreme as the things that happened between the 19th
[1:16:25.240 --> 1:16:29.720]  17th to 19th of november around the world that'll be a simultaneous events
[1:16:29.720 --> 1:16:34.760]  around the world but certainly major cold blast and snow storms uh in the
[1:16:34.760 --> 1:16:38.520]  in the in the usa probably probably you know
[1:16:38.520 --> 1:16:43.720]  certainly including the midwest now we we normally have a bit more detail than
[1:16:43.720 --> 1:16:46.760]  this and we will put out for that period
[1:16:46.760 --> 1:16:51.480]  some more details as far as we can uh ascertain it
[1:16:51.480 --> 1:16:55.240]  um and in the past we have put out quite a lot of detail
[1:16:55.240 --> 1:16:59.000]  we'll get a bit bit more for this the end part of the month
[1:16:59.000 --> 1:17:02.840]  will be accompanied by simultaneous events
[1:17:02.840 --> 1:17:08.120]  around the world and moving into january january the fifth to the eighth
[1:17:08.120 --> 1:17:13.160]  we'll also see um some quite a lot of extreme events and
[1:17:13.160 --> 1:17:17.000]  again we'll clarify the details of that on the website
[1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:20.760]  what about el nino and precipitation we've had
[1:17:20.760 --> 1:17:24.120]  uh less precipitation than we normally do the last three years
[1:17:24.120 --> 1:17:27.800]  on average in the u.s uh a lot of forecasts we're seeing say more
[1:17:27.800 --> 1:17:31.400]  precipitation is that lining up with your research well
[1:17:31.400 --> 1:17:35.720]  yes we will have to we've got to do a lot more work on american forecast because
[1:17:35.720 --> 1:17:41.560]  our most skill is britain uh island and uh europe
[1:17:41.560 --> 1:17:45.000]  and there's going to be simultaneous events you can get them free if you
[1:17:45.000 --> 1:17:48.840]  look on in in in europe too as happening in america
[1:17:48.840 --> 1:17:54.360]  um the uh main driver or the pattern the most
[1:17:54.360 --> 1:17:59.320]  significant pattern in america is a kind of 60 year cycle which is about the
[1:17:59.320 --> 1:18:03.000]  what's called the pacific decadal oscillation it's about the flow and
[1:18:03.000 --> 1:18:05.320]  temperature yeah the last drought was in the early
[1:18:05.320 --> 1:18:09.240]  fifties and i mean the really bad one and and now we've had another drought
[1:18:09.240 --> 1:18:12.440]  60 years later well that's right you see that's about uh
[1:18:12.440 --> 1:18:17.160]  60 years later you see and these these are driven or well let's say
[1:18:17.160 --> 1:18:21.000]  what happens in the pacific is part of the climate system which gives these
[1:18:21.000 --> 1:18:24.520]  things and that climate system the 60 year cycle is
[1:18:24.520 --> 1:18:31.000]  can be understood in terms of the the lunar modulation of the magnetic cycle
[1:18:31.000 --> 1:18:35.160]  of the sun and this is explained on our website in various
[1:18:35.160 --> 1:18:39.160]  documents and if people can't find out for those that don't know the moon drives
[1:18:39.160 --> 1:18:43.080]  the ocean it blocks out uh solar radiation that's right
[1:18:43.080 --> 1:18:46.600]  that's right it interferes with the solar wind so the
[1:18:46.600 --> 1:18:51.960]  the plane of the moon's orbit has a has a period of about it it rotates around
[1:18:51.960 --> 1:18:55.720]  the sun every 18 but according to the u n the sun the moon
[1:18:55.720 --> 1:19:00.440]  nothing well they would say that wouldn't they i mean you know they
[1:19:00.440 --> 1:19:08.120]  they have a mission to call us but the cons are so big to say polar bears can't
[1:19:08.120 --> 1:19:12.520]  swim their numbers are down when it's all about very well actually a polar bear
[1:19:12.520 --> 1:19:16.520]  they do it extremely well and anyway polar bears did it did very well
[1:19:16.520 --> 1:19:19.960]  during uh you know between 10 000 years ago and
[1:19:19.960 --> 1:19:24.360]  1 000 years ago when the world was warmer and you know the eskimos and so on
[1:19:24.360 --> 1:19:27.800]  but perfectly happy then so for them to say their feeling threatened is
[1:19:27.800 --> 1:19:32.040]  complete nonsense is utter utter rubbish it's a pack of lies
[1:19:32.040 --> 1:19:35.480]  it is it's utter rubbish to say that that the sun doesn't affect
[1:19:35.480 --> 1:19:39.320]  climate i mean they actually say that well this has been an amazing interview

[1:24:29.400 --> 1:24:34.440]  my head really does spin sometimes that they're telling school children
[1:24:34.440 --> 1:24:37.960]  in government produced documentaries that penguins are drowning and that
[1:24:37.960 --> 1:24:41.880]  holer bears are drowning they actually say it
[1:24:41.880 --> 1:24:46.920]  for years i saw it again two three weeks ago on kxan locally in austin
[1:24:46.920 --> 1:24:50.200]  i've seen speeches at the kopenhagen event in the last week and i'm hardly
[1:24:50.200 --> 1:24:53.880]  even watching it where they're saying the polar bears will all disappear
[1:24:53.880 --> 1:24:58.440]  they've got giant billboards up saying don't let the polar bears die and
[1:24:58.440 --> 1:25:02.440]  giant billboards of a little girl saying please don't let me drown
[1:25:02.440 --> 1:25:07.880]  they're telling kids the ocean like the day after demara funded by globalist
[1:25:07.880 --> 1:25:11.480]  is going to come crashing over with 500 foot waves
[1:25:11.480 --> 1:25:17.400]  knocking over the empire states building i mean it's it's it's as
[1:25:17.400 --> 1:25:21.400]  ridiculous as saying giant flying saucers are going to land
[1:25:21.400 --> 1:25:25.560]  and thousands of marvin the martians are going to march off with ray guns
[1:25:25.560 --> 1:25:32.280]  if we don't pay al gore money the un on monday came out and again
[1:25:32.280 --> 1:25:37.320]  countered and said the sun does not affect climate
[1:25:37.320 --> 1:25:42.120]  and then millions of zombies went the sun does not affect climate the sun
[1:25:42.120 --> 1:25:45.160]  does not affect climate jumping off cliffs
[1:25:45.160 --> 1:25:50.680]  does not break your legs uh you know jumping in front of 18 wheelers going

[1:25:58.360 --> 1:26:02.520]  i mean it's just it's ridiculous and now of course it's come out
[1:26:02.520 --> 1:26:06.360]  not just the white house memo not just the downing street memo
[1:26:06.360 --> 1:26:09.880]  but yes it's come out in the last two weeks that tony blare you know this is
[1:26:09.880 --> 1:26:14.280]  bbc reporting confirms that tony blare knew there were no
[1:26:14.280 --> 1:26:18.040]  wmd's of course they knew there were no wmd's
[1:26:18.040 --> 1:26:23.320]  of course they consciously knew and lied and went to war
[1:26:23.320 --> 1:26:26.440]  not oh they thought they were there and they were wrong
[1:26:26.440 --> 1:26:32.280]  they knew they lied for five years we've had the minutes of the meetings
[1:26:32.280 --> 1:26:35.560]  between blare and bush where bush said we're going to do
[1:26:35.560 --> 1:26:38.760]  this and we've got to make it up and they said okay how do we shoot down us
[1:26:38.760 --> 1:26:42.360]  planes and blame it on sedam how do we stage a terror attack
[1:26:42.360 --> 1:26:49.080]  this is all mainstream news and they're like yeah we stage terror attacks
[1:26:49.080 --> 1:26:53.240]  you know they tried that deal where they put out the radio transmission that
[1:26:53.240 --> 1:26:55.560]  we're going to blow up your ship we're going to blow up your ship in the
[1:26:55.560 --> 1:26:59.640]  straight over moose when a iranian patrol boat was a mile
[1:26:59.640 --> 1:27:03.320]  and a half away trying to get the people on the ship to
[1:27:03.320 --> 1:27:07.000]  open fire on the patrol boat and they did it over and over and over again with
[1:27:07.000 --> 1:27:10.520]  navy seals out there they didn't just plan it they did it
[1:27:10.520 --> 1:27:13.720]  running around broadcasting we're going to blow you up
[1:27:13.720 --> 1:27:17.160]  and i guess the seals thought they were just so macho they were going to take
[1:27:17.160 --> 1:27:21.000]  fire on their boat i mean how do they get these guys to engage in this type of
[1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:25.560]  treason well that's what tough guys do alex you're
[1:27:25.560 --> 1:27:29.000]  just not tough you don't know how to stage terror
[1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:32.360]  attacks because uh even if you know blowing up the world
[1:27:32.360 --> 1:27:36.920]  trade centers was killed three thousand if we don't fight the Arabs
[1:27:36.920 --> 1:27:40.840]  they're going to take over the world
[1:27:40.840 --> 1:27:44.840]  and america's weak and had to be taught and had to be shown a lesson so they'd
[1:27:44.840 --> 1:27:50.120]  get behind defending our sovereignty and stopping the muslims
[1:27:50.120 --> 1:27:53.400]  and then in every case the radical muslims are funded by our government
[1:27:53.400 --> 1:27:58.040]  on record and used to overthrow mainline and moderate and secular
[1:27:58.040 --> 1:28:01.800]  governments in the middle east and central asia
[1:28:01.800 --> 1:28:05.800]  yes i know they're wild-eyed muslims that want to chop your head off and
[1:28:05.800 --> 1:28:09.320]  drown their daughters because our stinking government and the british
[1:28:09.320 --> 1:28:13.160]  government put them in power our criminal government likes to
[1:28:13.160 --> 1:28:16.680]  deal with dictatorships
[1:28:16.680 --> 1:28:22.680]  they like to deal with thugs
[1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:29.080]  yes i i get the whole islamic fascism thing made in america made in
[1:28:29.080 --> 1:28:33.000]  england made in israel did those people exist
[1:28:33.000 --> 1:28:36.920]  before without the globalist helping them yes
[1:28:36.920 --> 1:28:41.800]  yes kind of like acorn existed before it was
[1:28:41.800 --> 1:28:50.120]  buried by a squirrel and then watered and loved and taken care of
[1:28:50.120 --> 1:28:55.240]  and then now is used to menace the west to give up all of our rights
[1:28:55.240 --> 1:29:00.600]  in the name of fighting the dangerous brown-skinned men that wear turbines
[1:29:00.600 --> 1:29:03.720]  that look funny
[1:29:04.280 --> 1:29:09.000]  but then you find out it's all a hollywood production
[1:29:09.000 --> 1:29:15.000]  and you get the homeland security documents that we got and we broke
[1:29:15.000 --> 1:29:19.160]  and it said first people couldn't believe it then it came out it wasn't real
[1:29:19.160 --> 1:29:22.520]  and people said oh i guess it's all right if veterans of the number one threat
[1:29:22.520 --> 1:29:27.320]  and homeland security is really set up for american gun owners
[1:29:27.320 --> 1:29:30.680]  that is a treasonous larcenist treacherous
[1:29:30.680 --> 1:29:35.720]  criminal illegitimate government it's a corporate group of crooks
[1:29:35.720 --> 1:29:39.800]  that have hijacked the nation now i know you know that
[1:29:39.800 --> 1:29:43.560]  but we better get that message out to everybody we know

[1:33:21.960 --> 1:33:25.080]  and i wanted to get him on with his perspective on copenhagen of course he
[1:33:25.080 --> 1:33:28.360]  worked with the national security agency he's written for some of the biggest
[1:33:28.360 --> 1:33:31.560]  publications in the country every time i'm watching a national
[1:33:31.560 --> 1:33:35.160]  security hearing in the house or senate i see wane madson back there taking
[1:33:35.160 --> 1:33:37.480]  notes and i wanted to get him on to get his take
[1:33:37.480 --> 1:33:41.560]  on copenhagen had no idea what his take would be of course it's my take exactly
[1:33:41.560 --> 1:33:45.720]  because it's just the truth that it's a total banker takeover but we'll get his
[1:33:45.720 --> 1:33:49.960]  take on that so see you don't just have the the the climate
[1:33:49.960 --> 1:33:54.120]  gate coming out and people on the right saying they don't want new taxes
[1:33:54.120 --> 1:33:58.120]  the the the left is finding out it's an imf world bank takeover so we'll talk
[1:33:58.120 --> 1:34:02.920]  about that then we'll get his take on health care it's not just in trouble
[1:34:02.920 --> 1:34:07.640]  with conservatives now the left the head of the democratic parties against it
[1:34:07.640 --> 1:34:11.160]  dean uh kesenich they say this isn't just a bailout
[1:34:11.160 --> 1:34:15.240]  it's a robbery well i told you that months ago was written by the insurance
[1:34:15.240 --> 1:34:18.600]  companies we're going to get wane madson's take on that so
[1:34:18.600 --> 1:34:21.720]  the more we learn about the copenhagen agreement the more we learn about the
[1:34:21.720 --> 1:34:25.240]  health care agreement we find out why they want to keep them secret
[1:34:25.240 --> 1:34:29.160]  because the minute you see them you find out it's just like the banker bailout
[1:34:29.160 --> 1:34:33.000]  i call it the rape out it wasn't a bailout they just robbed us
[1:34:33.000 --> 1:34:36.920]  and so anything that happens republican or democrat will be a robbery
[1:34:36.920 --> 1:34:40.680]  wane madson good to have you on with us
[1:34:43.000 --> 1:34:46.600]  uh we didn't have you punched up sorry wane uh wane go ahead good to have you
[1:34:46.600 --> 1:34:50.760]  with us hi alex good to be with you good to have you here okay break down
[1:34:50.760 --> 1:34:54.120]  copenhagen break down your take on health care and then i want to get your
[1:34:54.120 --> 1:34:58.440]  take on russia saying they may engage in preemptive war now
[1:34:58.440 --> 1:35:02.920]  because of nato and us policy wane madson well certainly with this copenhagen
[1:35:02.920 --> 1:35:06.840]  thing has turned into a you know basically a three-ring circus and i think a
[1:35:06.840 --> 1:35:11.880]  lot of people who went over there who had justified peers that
[1:35:11.880 --> 1:35:15.640]  wherever they came from in the world whether it was low-lying south pacific
[1:35:15.640 --> 1:35:19.480]  islands or in the andes where the glaciers
[1:35:19.480 --> 1:35:24.280]  are disappearing and their water is uh is becoming scarcer
[1:35:24.280 --> 1:35:27.320]  they only went to copenhagen thinking something good was going to happen
[1:35:27.320 --> 1:35:30.280]  they're looking there now and saying george soros
[1:35:30.280 --> 1:35:33.880]  hillary clinton with you know billions of dollars at stake carbon
[1:35:33.880 --> 1:35:37.800]  there's carbon exchange program that looks you know it's something like
[1:35:37.800 --> 1:35:40.840]  i think the carbon exchange is something bernie made up
[1:35:40.840 --> 1:35:46.040]  is now wishing he you know was out of prison and involved with uh he's
[1:35:46.040 --> 1:35:49.480]  probably kicking himself well can lighted in vinnett i mean
[1:35:49.480 --> 1:35:53.400]  okay and uh so what what's all these people
[1:35:53.400 --> 1:35:57.160]  what have they encountered in copenhagen but but police
[1:35:57.160 --> 1:36:02.760]  um teargassing them arresting them en masse just like we saw at the anti g8
[1:36:02.760 --> 1:36:07.160]  meetings just as we saw it at davos and other places
[1:36:07.160 --> 1:36:10.920]  where these same people get together and uh i think
[1:36:10.920 --> 1:36:14.680]  many people who are you know members of green peace
[1:36:14.680 --> 1:36:18.600]  fear club world wildlife you know people you know
[1:36:18.600 --> 1:36:22.680]  concerned about the environment and the climate part looking at and saying
[1:36:22.680 --> 1:36:26.280]  what in the world is this mess and you know to see there you know there's
[1:36:26.280 --> 1:36:30.360]  supporters you know people from indigenous areas around the world being
[1:36:30.360 --> 1:36:33.240]  arrested en masse you know you've got uh
[1:36:33.240 --> 1:36:36.920]  ego shavez going to copenhagen abel morales to bolivia
[1:36:36.920 --> 1:36:39.960]  daniel artega of nicaragua they're looking at their
[1:36:39.960 --> 1:36:42.840]  solo countryman being arrested they're shaking their heads and they're
[1:36:42.840 --> 1:36:46.680]  and they're looking around who they see they see the usual suspects obama
[1:36:46.680 --> 1:36:49.640]  i'm surprised tony blare he probably wanted to be there but he
[1:36:49.640 --> 1:36:54.360]  he may be facing war crimes charges so he tried to run for president of europe
[1:36:54.360 --> 1:36:57.960]  and he lost that but it's that same crowd they're looking around at these
[1:36:57.960 --> 1:37:01.880]  people who you see at all these various global meetings
[1:37:01.880 --> 1:37:05.080]  and are shaking their head they said you know i'm sure they're thinking this is
[1:37:05.080 --> 1:37:09.320]  in a double cross this is really like a triple cross
[1:37:09.320 --> 1:37:12.600]  that's right they suckered the third world and said you're going to get a bunch of
[1:37:12.600 --> 1:37:15.720]  loot from the west they show up they get the actual
[1:37:15.720 --> 1:37:18.280]  treaty and it says they've got to make right at
[1:37:18.280 --> 1:37:22.440]  double the carbon cuts the west does and the money's not even paid to the u n
[1:37:22.440 --> 1:37:25.640]  it's paid directly to the world bank on the imf
[1:37:25.640 --> 1:37:30.200]  i mean that is a bold fraud right then you have soros over there talking about
[1:37:30.200 --> 1:37:33.880]  special drawing rights uh trying to get his hands into the
[1:37:33.880 --> 1:37:38.120]  imf money and you know anytime you see soros involved with anything you know
[1:37:38.120 --> 1:37:43.000]  run for the exit because somebody's going to have their pocket tick pretty
[1:37:43.000 --> 1:37:46.520]  pretty liberally and uh but he's not certainly the only one it's
[1:37:46.520 --> 1:37:50.600]  you know just this this whole crowd bonki moon the u n secretary general
[1:37:50.600 --> 1:37:54.840]  he's you know he's not liked by a lot of the smaller countries the developing
[1:37:54.840 --> 1:37:57.960]  countries they know he's a proxy for the united states
[1:37:57.960 --> 1:38:01.880]  and and and the u.s allies and the banking uh sector and they're
[1:38:01.880 --> 1:38:04.440]  and and like i say people are just shaking their heads and
[1:38:04.440 --> 1:38:08.280]  Copenhagen saying how did and then they're looking at obama with the nobel peace prize
[1:38:08.280 --> 1:38:10.840]  for that he's getting kind person of the year
[1:38:10.840 --> 1:38:15.000]  you know it doesn't take uh these people very much for this is like kurt
[1:38:15.000 --> 1:38:20.280]  vonnegut satire exactly exactly this is something out of the bizarro world on
[1:38:20.280 --> 1:38:24.680]  superman it it really is insane so what do you see
[1:38:24.680 --> 1:38:28.440]  coming out of this an agreement to agree because obama's saying
[1:38:28.440 --> 1:38:32.360]  he doesn't care if the world doesn't sign on uh and we're to play the speech
[1:38:32.360 --> 1:38:35.480]  later he's saying he's going to go ahead and pledge the money
[1:38:35.480 --> 1:38:38.600]  to the world bank to then give loan sharking rate
[1:38:38.600 --> 1:38:41.640]  loans to the third world that's their assistance
[1:38:41.640 --> 1:38:45.160]  the third world's already learned about that assistance
[1:38:45.160 --> 1:38:49.400]  well i think what we're going to see is uh basically uh gridlock out of Copenhagen
[1:38:49.400 --> 1:38:52.360]  there'll be some kind of motherhood apple pie
[1:38:52.360 --> 1:38:57.160]  uh statement you know people will smile and say they agreed to it but there'll
[1:38:57.160 --> 1:38:59.560]  be a lot of world leaders leaving there especially
[1:38:59.560 --> 1:39:02.920]  those from the african latin america south pacific asia
[1:39:02.920 --> 1:39:06.200]  shaking their heads and saying this is what is what we expected
[1:39:06.200 --> 1:39:10.120]  uh this was uh typical of the of these big countries the
[1:39:10.120 --> 1:39:14.360]  the western countries and i think uh then we'll probably hear about some
[1:39:14.360 --> 1:39:17.960]  future meetings somewhere and we'll get a lot of propaganda about i don't know
[1:39:17.960 --> 1:39:21.400]  where it'll be and maybe some other city uh we've already been
[1:39:21.400 --> 1:39:25.400]  seen them in kiyoto and jakarta will probably pick up pick up
[1:39:25.400 --> 1:39:28.200]  pick out some other city and you know this is going to probably become like
[1:39:28.200 --> 1:39:30.760]  the olympics everybody's going to try to get this
[1:39:30.760 --> 1:39:34.760]  climate change conference to make some money
[1:39:35.400 --> 1:39:40.680]  shifting gears uh to the war uh for those that don't know maybe give them
[1:39:40.680 --> 1:39:43.560]  some background of course the downing street memo the
[1:39:43.560 --> 1:39:46.520]  white house memo it's it's confirmed that blaren bush
[1:39:46.520 --> 1:39:50.840]  knew there were no wmds it's not that they screwed up and were wrong
[1:39:50.840 --> 1:39:54.840]  they lied premeditatedly they wanted the oil they wanted the weapons sales they
[1:39:54.840 --> 1:39:57.800]  wanted to box in iran and china and russia
[1:39:57.800 --> 1:40:01.000]  and and get their set pieces in there for future conflicts
[1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:04.280]  like 888 that blew up in their face thank god
[1:40:04.280 --> 1:40:10.040]  uh but but now it more is coming out that blare knew it was premeditated
[1:40:10.040 --> 1:40:13.800]  uh and so there's talk of war crimes charges against him
[1:40:13.800 --> 1:40:19.400]  uh obama is expanding the war uh i mean this is what what is the rest of the
[1:40:19.400 --> 1:40:22.440]  world saying about this well i think what we're seeing with
[1:40:22.440 --> 1:40:25.400]  tony blare uh he's now going to be testifying before the
[1:40:25.400 --> 1:40:29.880]  chilcot inquiry in london we've seen already some uh testimony
[1:40:29.880 --> 1:40:33.000]  it's pretty explosive out of there saying that blare of course
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:36.840]  uh uh knew there was no wmds decided to go
[1:40:36.840 --> 1:40:41.000]  to war against iraq anyway you know preemptive warfare is against the
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:43.960]  nuremberg uh what we got out of the nuremberg
[1:40:43.960 --> 1:40:47.480]  trial it's a war crime and uh i think we're going to see
[1:40:47.480 --> 1:40:51.560]  greater calls for tony blare to uh be prosecuted
[1:40:51.560 --> 1:40:55.160]  uh in the hay and if that happens uh mr bush and mr cheney mr
[1:40:55.160 --> 1:40:58.520]  rumsel better watch out because they may be in fact next
[1:40:58.520 --> 1:41:02.200]  blare may set a precedent now blare is going to be testifying in public we
[1:41:02.200 --> 1:41:06.360]  understand and it'll be very interesting to uh hear what he has to say but
[1:41:06.360 --> 1:41:10.840]  obviously he's been caught uh he's been caught with his pants down on this one
[1:41:10.840 --> 1:41:14.600]  uh now he may try to get out of it by saying you know he wanted to be
[1:41:14.600 --> 1:41:18.360]  a good ally to george bush and if that happens then of course the onus will
[1:41:18.360 --> 1:41:23.480]  shift mr bush and mr cheney and notice they've been hiding out you never see
[1:41:23.480 --> 1:41:26.680]  them anymore yeah cheney was kind of active with his
[1:41:26.680 --> 1:41:29.240]  mouth a few months ago but i noticed he's
[1:41:29.240 --> 1:41:33.320]  he's been probably he's working on his memoirs probably they're gonna
[1:41:33.320 --> 1:41:39.320]  uh be out apparently in 2011 uh but he's probably spending a lot of time at
[1:41:39.320 --> 1:41:43.800]  his uh nice home over on the eastern shore maryland and out of
[1:41:43.800 --> 1:41:47.560]  his private country club community in wyoming
[1:41:47.560 --> 1:41:53.240]  or he's in the darth vader egg right well he's also has a big house he
[1:41:53.240 --> 1:41:56.840]  built right near the cia headquarters in the clain virginia but uh
[1:41:56.840 --> 1:42:01.080]  he's probably uh being the artful dodger he's probably going between the
[1:42:01.080 --> 1:42:05.400]  various homes though in case there is uh any interpol
[1:42:05.400 --> 1:42:10.440]  reds warrant put out he's probably gonna be pretty uh pretty hard to nap
[1:42:10.440 --> 1:42:14.920]  i don't think they're gonna let interpol go after lord cheney uh but um
[1:42:14.920 --> 1:42:20.440]  in closing wane madson i want to get into health care uh now folks i've been
[1:42:20.440 --> 1:42:23.480]  telling people since we got the first versions of these bills
[1:42:23.480 --> 1:42:27.320]  five six months ago there's been i don't know more than 10 versions now
[1:42:27.320 --> 1:42:30.680]  every one of the versions was written and and their lobbyists
[1:42:30.680 --> 1:42:34.040]  have bragged to the wall street journal the head lobbyists for the health care
[1:42:34.040 --> 1:42:36.440]  industry and the other head lobbyists because they can that they have
[1:42:36.440 --> 1:42:40.360]  consortium leaders uh for the insurance companies
[1:42:40.360 --> 1:42:44.120]  said we wrote this bill well of course they wrote it
[1:42:44.120 --> 1:42:48.920]  uh we're talking about five years in prison quarter million dollar fines
[1:42:48.920 --> 1:42:52.200]  2.5 to 5 percent of your paycheck depending on your
[1:42:52.200 --> 1:43:00.360]  your your uh your your tax bracket put into a fund uh all of this is going on
[1:43:00.360 --> 1:43:04.440]  and and it gives liability protection to the insurance companies and the
[1:43:04.440 --> 1:43:08.840]  doctors it does federalize and and let bureaucrats start
[1:43:08.840 --> 1:43:13.160]  setting the treatments for people it cuts back on tests that are essential
[1:43:13.160 --> 1:43:18.840]  this is eugenics and now the actual socialists have discovered this so how
[1:43:18.840 --> 1:43:22.520]  our dean is freaking out dennis consent is freaking out
[1:43:22.520 --> 1:43:27.400]  and uh the bill was already in trouble break down what's really in the bill
[1:43:27.400 --> 1:43:31.560]  uh why we are seeing some actual honesty from the democratic party
[1:43:31.560 --> 1:43:34.280]  some sectors of it and what you think's going to happen with this bill
[1:43:34.280 --> 1:43:39.560]  wane madson well what we saw come out of the bill was uh a proposal to extend
[1:43:39.560 --> 1:43:43.320]  medicare benefits to people 55 and odor
[1:43:43.320 --> 1:43:47.080]  over uh we also that was taken out that was
[1:43:47.080 --> 1:43:50.520]  Joe Lieberman went after that one uh we also saw
[1:43:50.520 --> 1:43:54.920]  another proposal to have a public option basically emaciated that's why
[1:43:54.920 --> 1:43:58.600]  that's why the obama administration and their congressional supporters have
[1:43:58.600 --> 1:44:01.160]  lost the support of people like howard dean
[1:44:01.160 --> 1:44:06.520]  uh rust fine gold uh all all all people i might add who may be potential
[1:44:06.520 --> 1:44:10.280]  challengers to mr obama in the 2012
[1:44:10.280 --> 1:44:14.360]  primary we're hearing a lot more about him maybe even having more potential
[1:44:14.360 --> 1:44:18.200]  challengers and linden johnson had in 68 unpopular
[1:44:18.200 --> 1:44:21.480]  unpopularity over the war the self-care fiasco
[1:44:21.480 --> 1:44:25.560]  uh johnson of course had eugenie mccarthy and bobby kennedy
[1:44:25.560 --> 1:44:28.760]  and decided he wasn't going to run again um but
[1:44:28.760 --> 1:44:33.400]  uh the obama may face actually more challengers than the mr johnson did
[1:44:33.400 --> 1:44:37.640]  uh in his in his final term uh but what we're seeing is
[1:44:37.640 --> 1:44:42.440]  now we're hearing calls you know people will may refuse on mass to pay the fine
[1:44:42.440 --> 1:44:46.600]  nationwide these these are not coming from paybackers these are coming from
[1:44:46.600 --> 1:44:50.520]  people who are on the progressive side of the democratic party so it's
[1:44:50.520 --> 1:44:53.960]  it's a very interesting dynamic we're sitting here the
[1:44:53.960 --> 1:44:57.160]  loud protestant you know talking about you know what this
[1:44:57.160 --> 1:45:00.120]  you know massively refuse to pay the fine
[1:45:00.120 --> 1:45:05.640]  um it's coming from the left and i'm not sure that's what mr obama bargained
[1:45:05.640 --> 1:45:08.760]  for i'll tell you one guy in washington is not very popular is rama
[1:45:08.760 --> 1:45:13.640]  manuel the chief of staff uh i mean there's no calls for his head
[1:45:13.640 --> 1:45:17.400]  uh from from some of the people on the progressive side of the democratic
[1:45:17.400 --> 1:45:20.360]  party in congress and i'd be surprised to see
[1:45:20.360 --> 1:45:25.880]  mr manuel last uh much past the new year that's right political and the hill
[1:45:25.880 --> 1:45:29.240]  both dc-based publications for folks that
[1:45:29.240 --> 1:45:33.640]  aren't aware of the fact that they're not just
[1:45:33.640 --> 1:45:37.960]  web publications but based out of dc they're both seeing that a manual just
[1:45:37.960 --> 1:45:41.080]  calls up and screams at senior congressman
[1:45:41.080 --> 1:45:45.240]  uh in a hitlerian fashion that is going to blow up in their face
[1:45:45.240 --> 1:45:48.680]  and i've seen this with hype machines the bigger
[1:45:48.680 --> 1:45:53.240]  they build something up if it doesn't deliver it implodes even faster
[1:45:53.240 --> 1:45:57.160]  and obama for the last six months has had the lowest approval rating of any
[1:45:57.160 --> 1:46:03.720]  president this far into uh his first year and now he's
[1:46:03.720 --> 1:46:08.520]  even breaking his own records i mean i mean it it is a
[1:46:08.520 --> 1:46:12.360]  dive straight downward because people are finding out
[1:46:12.360 --> 1:46:16.840]  this is a warmongering police state loving secret arresting
[1:46:16.840 --> 1:46:24.040]  rendition promoting lobbyist hiring neocon masquerading as a communist you
[1:46:24.040 --> 1:46:28.040]  and i hear people calling a communist no he's a corporate looter
[1:46:28.040 --> 1:46:31.640]  right right and then i've given you a lot of people now talking about this
[1:46:31.640 --> 1:46:34.760]  being the third term of george w bush i mean
[1:46:34.760 --> 1:46:38.200]  and these are serious people they're i mean they're joking but they're really
[1:46:38.200 --> 1:46:41.640]  kind of serious and making those allegations but but the other thing
[1:46:41.640 --> 1:46:44.920]  that's interesting is we have a federal judge now has been assigned to rod
[1:46:44.920 --> 1:46:48.920]  blagojowicz uh criminal case in illinois now stating that he would
[1:46:48.920 --> 1:46:51.800]  not be opposed to the defense blagojowicz is
[1:46:51.800 --> 1:46:56.440]  defense lawyers calling his witnesses mr. immanuel and he'd get ready for this
[1:46:56.440 --> 1:46:59.400]  mr. obama and uh on that whole thing with the
[1:46:59.400 --> 1:47:03.240]  selling of the obama senate seat if that happens if the president
[1:47:03.240 --> 1:47:07.320]  president will try to invoke executive privilege and so will probably immanuel
[1:47:07.320 --> 1:47:10.360]  i don't know how he'll do it though because it all this happened before
[1:47:10.360 --> 1:47:14.360]  they were sworn in or became you know in case of obama sworn in
[1:47:14.360 --> 1:47:17.960]  immanuel being appointed uh chief of staff but we could have a real
[1:47:17.960 --> 1:47:21.560]  constitutional crisis on top of everything else and that that just
[1:47:21.560 --> 1:47:25.080]  does not vote well for this administration if that should occur
[1:47:25.080 --> 1:47:29.080]  well that starts happening look for blagojowicz's aircraft to blow up
[1:47:29.080 --> 1:47:35.320]  or for him to have a sudden aneurysm or a uh 72 hour brain tumor
[1:47:35.320 --> 1:47:39.000]  absolutely well we'll we'll have to see how that one goes but we all remember
[1:47:39.000 --> 1:47:43.640]  the the height uh when bill clinton of course uh had to testify in the
[1:47:43.640 --> 1:47:49.000]  in the in the paul jones case uh uh with the independent prosecutor
[1:47:49.000 --> 1:47:53.560]  kind of star and that you know we we had talk of a constitutional crisis there
[1:47:53.560 --> 1:47:56.280]  uh but that certainly did not do much for clinton's
[1:47:56.280 --> 1:47:59.480]  care members when you have the sitting president testifying
[1:47:59.480 --> 1:48:03.320]  uh in a case like that uh we may see the same thing happened
[1:48:03.320 --> 1:48:07.480]  to mr obama and of course immanuel and david axelrod
[1:48:07.480 --> 1:48:11.240]  uh valery jarrett and other key members of this administration
[1:48:11.240 --> 1:48:14.520]  so do you think uh the health care is going to pass
[1:48:14.520 --> 1:48:18.120]  i think it'll pass um i mean it's not going to be
[1:48:18.120 --> 1:48:21.160]  what we see come out isn't going to be very much i mean
[1:48:21.160 --> 1:48:25.560]  i think uh uh people who were hoping to see something for people who are
[1:48:25.560 --> 1:48:29.640]  uninsured are going to be sadly disappointed you know the fact is
[1:48:29.640 --> 1:48:33.800]  isn't it funny that the guy that the guy that this all hinges on is
[1:48:33.800 --> 1:48:38.920]  is is joe leverman the guy who supported mccain in the last election
[1:48:38.920 --> 1:48:42.280]  uh was al goers running made of course in 2000 who
[1:48:42.280 --> 1:48:46.360]  was put in a senate from connecticut because we in buckley hated
[1:48:46.360 --> 1:48:50.600]  the sitting republican wall waker so much who was he considered too liberal
[1:48:50.600 --> 1:48:53.640]  he said i'd rather have a conservative democrat
[1:48:53.640 --> 1:48:56.680]  in that seat than the wall waker and hence we got
[1:48:56.680 --> 1:48:59.640]  lieberman Lieberman is basically a republican parading around as a
[1:48:59.640 --> 1:49:03.000]  democrat finally maybe some people waking up and
[1:49:03.000 --> 1:49:05.720]  looking and seeing him for what he really is well
[1:49:05.720 --> 1:49:10.280]  my issue is anything they do even if you're for
[1:49:10.280 --> 1:49:15.080]  socialist health care then it better be socialist this is not socialist
[1:49:15.080 --> 1:49:19.160]  this is just another robbery and so that's why i'm always against big
[1:49:19.160 --> 1:49:22.680]  government because it always turns into a swindle we got a minute and a half
[1:49:22.680 --> 1:49:26.600]  left russia is announcing they may preemptively use nukes
[1:49:26.600 --> 1:49:31.560]  if anyone gets in their business well i think uh obviously you're looking at
[1:49:31.560 --> 1:49:34.520]  nato now coming right up to their borders uh
[1:49:34.520 --> 1:49:38.680]  uh we have uh the nato secretary general uh
[1:49:38.680 --> 1:49:41.640]  rasmussen who was the former danish prime minister
[1:49:41.640 --> 1:49:46.040]  he's a neocon i mean so he's gonna he's gonna basically do everything on the
[1:49:46.040 --> 1:49:50.440]  neocon uh playlists and uh they're looking at all
[1:49:50.440 --> 1:49:53.880]  this and they're saying well if you're going to play hardball with us we can
[1:49:53.880 --> 1:49:57.880]  play hardball back and uh i think we're going to see a lot more
[1:49:57.880 --> 1:50:02.120]  uh elements that are going to look like the cold war but uh i don't think we'll
[1:50:02.120 --> 1:50:06.040]  ever go back to those days but there'll be a lot of grandstandings certainly
[1:50:06.040 --> 1:50:10.440]  uh and you know the u.s and russia still have have not agreed on
[1:50:10.440 --> 1:50:17.240]  uh the nuclear uh uh reduction nuclear weapons reduction and why is the west
[1:50:17.240 --> 1:50:22.120]  menacing russia yeah yeah i mean obama doesn't want to do much on that and
[1:50:22.120 --> 1:50:25.240]  there's a lot of you can complain to even out of the state department that
[1:50:25.240 --> 1:50:30.680]  obama's dragon is feet on on the but why is the west menacing russia
[1:50:30.680 --> 1:50:34.440]  well obviously that they aren't going along with the program uh
[1:50:34.440 --> 1:50:38.680]  you know the issue of uh the breakaway regions of georgia
[1:50:38.680 --> 1:50:41.960]  uh being recognized that that's just one of many issues
[1:50:41.960 --> 1:50:46.040]  uh uh and russia now uh supporting the progressive
[1:50:46.040 --> 1:50:49.320]  governments in latin america that's right in what the
[1:50:49.320 --> 1:50:52.920]  u.s considers its backyard and obviously the neocons
[1:50:52.920 --> 1:50:56.520]  we're still very much present in the obama okay wane we're out of time wane

[1:58:51.880 --> 1:58:55.080]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[1:58:55.080 --> 1:58:58.760]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[1:58:58.760 --> 1:59:00.840]  easily double or triple your electric bill
[1:59:00.840 --> 1:59:05.080]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[1:59:05.080 --> 1:59:08.680]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[1:59:08.680 --> 1:59:12.200]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[1:59:12.200 --> 1:59:15.880]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[1:59:15.880 --> 1:59:18.840]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[1:59:18.840 --> 1:59:22.760]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[1:59:22.760 --> 1:59:25.880]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[1:59:25.880 --> 1:59:29.800]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[1:59:29.800 --> 1:59:32.680]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[1:59:32.680 --> 1:59:35.560]  folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions
[1:59:35.560 --> 1:59:39.240]  from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at
[1:59:39.240 --> 1:59:43.720]  www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com
[1:59:43.720 --> 1:59:47.800]  remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to mysolarbackup.com
[1:59:47.800 --> 1:59:53.400]  or call 1-877-327-0365
[1:59:53.400 --> 2:00:06.840]  waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network
[2:00:06.840 --> 2:00:11.640]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups
[2:00:11.640 --> 2:00:18.920]  you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the gcm radio network
[2:00:18.920 --> 2:00:26.760]  and now live from austin texas alex jones
[2:00:26.760 --> 2:00:35.080]  33 minutes from now robert wanick will be joining us persecuted in the uss
[2:00:35.080 --> 2:00:41.000]  arm but the united states has turned into
[2:00:41.000 --> 2:00:44.200]  or the ussa
[2:00:44.200 --> 2:00:49.640]  and then we have the lead singer of the rock band i stirrth they've been around
[2:00:49.640 --> 2:00:53.880]  for a long time very popular they're on a whole bunch of charts
[2:00:53.880 --> 2:00:57.160]  globally continually over the year so it's a top rock band
[2:00:57.160 --> 2:01:01.800]  if you haven't heard of them the issue is they're putting out a completely free
[2:01:01.800 --> 2:01:05.400]  album and they're launching it today on this show
[2:01:05.400 --> 2:01:10.520]  and this is a platinum band so again they're getting into the fight
[2:01:10.520 --> 2:01:15.800]  and that's why i just pointed out my films are all free
[2:01:15.800 --> 2:01:21.240]  same thing you want to be tearing it you got to give something
[2:01:21.240 --> 2:01:24.520]  and i want to salute i stirrth for what they're doing
[2:01:24.520 --> 2:01:34.280]  now look we're able to fund our operation off dvd sales radio advertisers
[2:01:34.280 --> 2:01:38.440]  and sometimes it gets tough but
[2:01:38.440 --> 2:01:41.400]  when you order the dvds the books the materials
[2:01:41.400 --> 2:01:46.120]  that is basically a donation we're not tax exempt though because we're not under
[2:01:46.120 --> 2:01:49.640]  the globalist control we'd be under government control if we did that
[2:01:49.640 --> 2:01:53.400]  since they've taken over the charities and the churches it's totally unconstitutional
[2:01:53.400 --> 2:01:57.560]  but i wish we were tax exempt i could probably do it if i wanted to but then
[2:01:57.560 --> 2:02:00.600]  that would bring them into my lives and i don't want to mess with it the point
[2:02:00.600 --> 2:02:04.280]  here is that when you purchase the books and videos and
[2:02:04.280 --> 2:02:09.080]  materials on the sites that's how you fund our operation
[2:02:09.080 --> 2:02:14.520]  and it's almost pearls before swine with some people
[2:02:15.160 --> 2:02:19.720]  cash not your pearls before swine at least they turn on you and
[2:02:19.720 --> 2:02:23.720]  and and and and rins you to tear your guts out
[2:02:23.720 --> 2:02:28.120]  you know i say oh here's a two hundred thousand dollar film i made
[2:02:28.120 --> 2:02:32.520]  you know i didn't go out and buy two bentley's with this i made the film
[2:02:32.520 --> 2:02:36.840]  and it's free people go eh so what yeah
[2:02:36.840 --> 2:02:42.360]  i mean people on airplanes interviews 18 hour days bloodshot eyes
[2:02:42.360 --> 2:02:46.040]  composing the music all the work that went into this with my team
[2:02:46.040 --> 2:02:50.280]  and we say here it is it's free and people tend to not appreciate something
[2:02:50.280 --> 2:02:55.960]  unless they pay for it it's weird so i hope you appreciate
[2:02:55.960 --> 2:03:00.120]  what ice earth has done guaranteed losing millions of dollars giving you
[2:03:00.120 --> 2:03:04.120]  this for free and i hope you appreciate what we do here
[2:03:04.120 --> 2:03:07.880]  because i happen to know smaller filmmakers than i that make more money
[2:03:07.880 --> 2:03:10.920]  because they don't let people duplicate their films
[2:03:10.920 --> 2:03:15.400]  and they don't let people have them on the web and you do end up selling more
[2:03:15.400 --> 2:03:18.760]  it reaches one one hundredth of what you would have reached
[2:03:18.760 --> 2:03:23.160]  see i want minds the globalist want minds for their evil
[2:03:23.160 --> 2:03:26.680]  aims i want minds because i'm into freedom and liberty
[2:03:26.680 --> 2:03:31.080]  and i get excited about the dynamic human spirit and i i i get excited about
[2:03:31.080 --> 2:03:34.760]  my species in our future and i don't want the bad karma
[2:03:34.760 --> 2:03:38.840]  i don't believe in the karma itself but i like the term it's really repuch is so
[2:03:38.840 --> 2:03:42.040]  the average person doesn't know what that means now but they know what karma is
[2:03:42.040 --> 2:03:45.800]  it's just been made popular so remember i'm always kind of reaching out to some
[2:03:45.800 --> 2:03:48.680]  of the lowest common denominator i know we have listeners that are a lot
[2:03:48.680 --> 2:03:51.240]  smarter than i am but there's some people that don't get it
[2:03:51.240 --> 2:03:55.560]  i don't want to do bad things not just because i'm scared of the universe
[2:03:55.560 --> 2:04:00.440]  coming back at me but because i enjoy doing good
[2:04:01.480 --> 2:04:04.680]  i don't feel good when i help a little old lady across the street because i'm
[2:04:04.680 --> 2:04:07.960]  into being a goody two shoes at a fundamental level
[2:04:07.960 --> 2:04:12.040]  helping people is what i like to do at a fundamental level i also want to
[2:04:12.040 --> 2:04:16.120]  knock the teeth out of bad people that's normal folks
[2:04:16.120 --> 2:04:20.840]  and we need to get back to being normal we become abnormal
[2:04:20.840 --> 2:04:24.200]  i'd have fit in real good three or four thousand years ago folks
[2:04:24.200 --> 2:04:30.760]  you know living in some uh Nordic tribe somewhere
[2:04:30.760 --> 2:04:35.880]  just normal behavior that's why people like dogs so much because they're so
[2:04:35.880 --> 2:04:39.400]  similar to primitive man they just it's just it's all straight up you know
[2:04:39.400 --> 2:04:42.360]  what you got with the dog not these neurotic twisted
[2:04:42.360 --> 2:04:46.840]  gibbering lying demon creatures that we call human beings
[2:04:46.840 --> 2:04:51.720]  we have got to stand up against the new world order so please support us
[2:04:51.720 --> 2:04:55.240]  and since the films are free online get the urls

[2:08:00.520 --> 2:08:14.200]  today
[2:08:17.800 --> 2:08:23.160]  we are simulcasting at prismplanet.tv and living color for all the radio
[2:08:23.160 --> 2:08:28.200]  listeners that wish to tune in on the web not just to audio but to the live
[2:08:28.200 --> 2:08:33.400]  video at prismplanet.tv coming up health care bill
[2:08:33.400 --> 2:08:37.640]  wouldn't bring real reform howard dean says he's getting ready to get somebody
[2:08:37.640 --> 2:08:43.640]  to run against obama in 2012 because he knows
[2:08:43.640 --> 2:08:50.280]  obama is going to be out of there this is the third
[2:08:50.280 --> 2:08:56.040]  administration of george w bush obama is a colossal hoax
[2:08:56.040 --> 2:08:58.840]  he's as big a hoax as man made global warming
[2:08:58.840 --> 2:09:03.800]  he's as big a hoax as wmd's in iraq this isn't about partisanship left or
[2:09:03.800 --> 2:09:08.680]  right it's about the truth and if you're a socialist
[2:09:08.680 --> 2:09:13.000]  who really wants government health care
[2:09:13.640 --> 2:09:16.680]  you're a well-meaning liberal that wants to help people that don't have health
[2:09:16.680 --> 2:09:21.000]  care you have to be against this bill
[2:09:21.000 --> 2:09:25.400]  because it's as denis kasinich said it is nothing but a corporate rip-off
[2:09:25.400 --> 2:09:30.920]  it raises your taxes and cuts your benefits and it puts you in prison
[2:09:30.920 --> 2:09:35.160]  i mean it's so unamerican it makes my head spin so unconstitutional
[2:09:35.160 --> 2:09:39.240]  now i'm against free health care because there's nothing that's free in this
[2:09:39.240 --> 2:09:41.800]  world and it gives government control over your life
[2:09:41.800 --> 2:09:45.720]  and any big government system turns into a rip-off
[2:09:45.720 --> 2:09:50.440]  because only big powerful financial interest can come in and move the levers
[2:09:50.440 --> 2:09:54.120]  of government so any big government is always
[2:09:54.120 --> 2:09:56.520]  going to burn you and is always going to be a fraud
[2:09:56.520 --> 2:10:00.840]  that is the nature of it it is like a law of gravity
[2:10:00.840 --> 2:10:05.960]  or the law of thermodynamics or the law of cause and effect it is a
[2:10:05.960 --> 2:10:11.720]  law not a theory big government is hell
[2:10:11.720 --> 2:10:17.800]  people want solutions cut government instead obama has spent more money
[2:10:17.800 --> 2:10:22.600]  than all presidents before him combined
[2:10:22.600 --> 2:10:26.760]  now the buck doesn't stop with obama i told people in obama deception and fall
[2:10:26.760 --> 2:10:30.040]  the republic he will be politically destroyed
[2:10:30.040 --> 2:10:33.320]  and then everything will be blamed on him and then the next puppet will come
[2:10:33.320 --> 2:10:35.880]  in and everything will be blamed on that puppet
[2:10:35.880 --> 2:10:39.640]  please ladies and gentlemen look past the little puppets dancing in front of
[2:10:39.640 --> 2:10:42.120]  you to the person pulling the strings
[2:10:42.120 --> 2:10:46.200]  burnacchi summers geithner
[2:10:46.200 --> 2:10:52.920]  reuben the roth childs the rockefellers and finally the real elite is being
[2:10:52.920 --> 2:10:58.920]  revealed now in kopenhagen
[2:11:00.280 --> 2:11:04.120]  the meeting is in trouble because africa asia and latin america have
[2:11:04.120 --> 2:11:08.680]  discovered that its massive taxes paid directly to the imf and world bank
[2:11:08.680 --> 2:11:12.360]  from the third world and the first world the developing and the developed to be
[2:11:12.360 --> 2:11:18.120]  paid to the imf and world bank the un has no control even if you trust the un
[2:11:18.120 --> 2:11:21.560]  it's going to the imf and world bank who are even worse
[2:11:21.560 --> 2:11:28.360]  if they're the progenitors of the un nothing but a holding front for them
[2:11:28.360 --> 2:11:36.200]  george soros is involved global taxes global gdp taxes global taxes with a
[2:11:36.200 --> 2:11:39.960]  global authority over all money transfers that's what's in the treaty
[2:11:39.960 --> 2:11:43.400]  go to info wars dot com go to prison planet dot com
[2:11:43.400 --> 2:11:47.320]  go over the documents go over the latest treaty
[2:11:47.320 --> 2:11:52.120]  paul watson's written an article about it he has links to the treaty
[2:11:53.400 --> 2:11:57.720]  don't believe me read this for yourself then when you see obama up there talking
[2:11:57.720 --> 2:12:03.000]  about how war is peace and how uh this is a great deal for the third
[2:12:03.000 --> 2:12:07.240]  world and how america's bad and has to pay its debt
[2:12:07.240 --> 2:12:12.360]  that's meant to sell the left and america
[2:12:12.360 --> 2:12:16.440]  bashers on oh we're going to get behind this when it's actually genocide to
[2:12:16.440 --> 2:12:20.600]  their countries and is actually meant to target them and destroy the development
[2:12:20.600 --> 2:12:25.080]  of their industrial capacity and is a death sentence
[2:12:25.080 --> 2:12:30.440]  just the u.s and brazil shifting to 30 percent of their cornfields to ethanol
[2:12:30.440 --> 2:12:34.920]  doubled world food prices and killed an extra 10 million people from starvation
[2:12:34.920 --> 2:12:40.040]  normally it's 15 mil it was 25 mil those are conservative estimates you think
[2:12:40.040 --> 2:12:43.320]  about 10 million people i know stalin said that
[2:12:43.320 --> 2:12:47.480]  one person's a tragedy 10 000s of statistic but you wrap your mind around
[2:12:47.480 --> 2:12:52.040]  that you let that sink in now in this segment and
[2:12:52.040 --> 2:12:56.520]  and the next few i'm going to play obama's speech today in kopenhagen the
[2:12:56.520 --> 2:13:00.440]  final day of the official world government event i mean that's what
[2:13:00.440 --> 2:13:04.600]  bancai moon calls it that's what von rumpi calls it the head of the u head of
[2:13:04.600 --> 2:13:06.920]  the u.n. swartz and egger calls it that
[2:13:06.920 --> 2:13:10.360]  david iraq child calls it that no more denial
[2:13:10.360 --> 2:13:15.400]  private world government so i'm going to play obama and briefly stop him
[2:13:15.400 --> 2:13:23.000]  and cover each lie here is obama today in kopenhagen morning
[2:13:23.000 --> 2:13:26.920]  it is an honor for me to join this distinguished group of leaders from
[2:13:26.920 --> 2:13:33.160]  nations around the world we come here in kopenhagen because climate
[2:13:33.160 --> 2:13:40.280]  change poses a grave and growing danger to our people
[2:13:40.280 --> 2:13:44.600]  all of you would not be here unless you like me
[2:13:44.600 --> 2:13:51.320]  were convinced okay now that's about 30 seconds of it let's go
[2:13:51.320 --> 2:13:54.200]  over the lies he says all of you leaders are here
[2:13:54.200 --> 2:13:58.200]  you all agree that climate change is a grave and deadly threat and is really
[2:13:58.200 --> 2:14:01.240]  happening that's a complete fraud more than
[2:14:01.240 --> 2:14:05.240]  50 of the delegates of the 190 plus that are there
[2:14:05.240 --> 2:14:08.360]  on record have said they are questioning climate gate
[2:14:08.360 --> 2:14:12.040]  and the official story and a bunch of world leaders from those countries are
[2:14:12.040 --> 2:14:16.200]  questioning it and that's on record you know the president of the
[2:14:16.200 --> 2:14:20.200]  check republic countless others the russians you name it
[2:14:20.200 --> 2:14:25.240]  the japanese the chinese the indians the i mean it goes on and on
[2:14:25.240 --> 2:14:28.120]  so that's a lie you're all here you all agree
[2:14:28.120 --> 2:14:31.960]  and you all agree it's a grave danger and notice it's not global warming now
[2:14:31.960 --> 2:14:36.600]  because things are getting colder naturally it's global change or the
[2:14:36.600 --> 2:14:41.080]  change is not normal the seasons are not normal
[2:14:41.080 --> 2:14:47.560]  okay so let's continue unless you like me were convinced
[2:14:47.560 --> 2:14:52.920]  that this danger is real this is not fiction
[2:14:52.920 --> 2:14:59.000]  it is science hit pause this is not fiction in his science when the main
[2:14:59.000 --> 2:15:03.400]  un university in england that produced the key documents
[2:15:03.400 --> 2:15:08.600]  and the head scientist for the ipcc santa separately from climate gate
[2:15:08.600 --> 2:15:12.360]  now admits as of wednesday on national u.s television
[2:15:12.360 --> 2:15:16.120]  this is huge news that he took out five areas of the report
[2:15:16.120 --> 2:15:20.280]  where the un's own scientist said man is not causing this
[2:15:20.280 --> 2:15:24.120]  the final report they cut it out of course man can't
[2:15:24.120 --> 2:15:28.840]  do anything near the sun or anything near the moon
[2:15:28.840 --> 2:15:33.480]  and and and oh the title changes from from the moon the amount of gases
[2:15:33.480 --> 2:15:37.000]  exchanged by all of that water moving
[2:15:37.000 --> 2:15:41.720]  i mean that alone the moon is unbelievable but the sun dwarfs it
[2:15:41.720 --> 2:15:49.000]  so it's just incredible all of it is lies
[2:15:49.000 --> 2:15:52.760]  continue unchecked climate change will pose
[2:15:52.760 --> 2:15:59.160]  unacceptable risks to our security our economies
[2:15:59.160 --> 2:16:02.680]  and our planet hit pause
[2:16:02.680 --> 2:16:09.960]  unacceptable risk you have the un caught
[2:16:09.960 --> 2:16:14.520]  fixing the data this is the same thing when he talks about this is not a
[2:16:14.520 --> 2:16:19.560]  fiction this is science science that's like al gore
[2:16:19.560 --> 2:16:23.320]  talking about how he invented the internet total line or al gore saying
[2:16:23.320 --> 2:16:26.360]  polar bears can't swim and are all dying from their numbers and more than
[2:16:26.360 --> 2:16:30.600]  tripled in the last 50 years official numbers
[2:16:30.600 --> 2:16:34.360]  that's like bill clinton saying i did not have
[2:16:34.360 --> 2:16:38.680]  sexual that woman or richard nixon saying i'm not a crook
[2:16:38.680 --> 2:16:44.040]  or george bush senior saying read my lips it's a lie
[2:16:44.040 --> 2:16:52.600]  it's a lie so he's saying this is science this is fact you can't question
[2:16:52.600 --> 2:16:57.320]  when their scientists have been proven in premeditated fraud
[2:16:57.320 --> 2:17:01.880]  here's a guy saying pay taxes to a private global corporation the world
[2:17:01.880 --> 2:17:06.200]  bank and imf or the or the the seas are going to rise and you're going to drown
[2:17:06.200 --> 2:17:10.360]  back to it this much we know
[2:17:11.080 --> 2:17:17.160]  the question then before us is no longer the nature of the challenge
[2:17:17.160 --> 2:17:20.520]  the question is our capacity to meet it hit pause
[2:17:20.520 --> 2:17:24.440]  see he just keeps saying everyone knows everyone knows it's not a question
[2:17:24.440 --> 2:17:28.200]  it's a fact we know the facts are in you've got to do what i say
[2:17:28.200 --> 2:17:32.120]  it's a fact it's a fact it's a fact a total con man
[2:17:32.120 --> 2:17:38.120]  just a slick harvard lawyer con man running a scam on the dumb public
[2:17:38.120 --> 2:17:42.280]  well the dumb public woke up to your scam buddy let's go back to him
[2:17:42.280 --> 2:17:47.720]  for while the reality of climate change is not in doubt
[2:17:47.720 --> 2:17:51.640]  i have to be honest there you go hit pause again i mean ladies and gentlemen
[2:17:51.640 --> 2:17:55.720]  i'm trying to play this we're not even two minutes into it
[2:17:55.720 --> 2:17:59.800]  he says while the reality of climate change is not in doubt
[2:17:59.800 --> 2:18:04.920]  i guess in a lawyer speak that's true the climate is always changing just like
[2:18:04.920 --> 2:18:07.960]  on mars there the ice caps were getting smaller
[2:18:07.960 --> 2:18:13.720]  the last 50 years suddenly the last five is sort of getting bigger again
[2:18:13.720 --> 2:18:17.560]  because the sun just cooled off that's why it's going to get colder here
[2:18:17.560 --> 2:18:21.160]  i mean it's not a conspiracy theory folks that if you stand in front of a
[2:18:21.160 --> 2:18:25.320]  fireplace it heats your hands and and that the sun heats up and
[2:18:25.320 --> 2:18:29.720]  cools off it oscillates in cycles in 21
[2:18:29.720 --> 2:18:33.400]  year cycles and 11 year cycles
[2:18:33.800 --> 2:18:37.720]  i mean ancients worship the sun because they knew
[2:18:37.720 --> 2:18:41.800]  it created the heat the un said on monday no it's not the sun the sun has
[2:18:41.800 --> 2:18:46.440]  no effect that's associated press headline
[2:18:46.440 --> 2:18:50.040]  that google that un says sun has no effect on climate i mean
[2:18:50.040 --> 2:18:54.120]  ladies and gentlemen penguins can swim their numbers are up
[2:18:54.120 --> 2:18:57.800]  polar bears can swim they hunt on the ice flows they're not rounding the sun
[2:18:57.800 --> 2:19:00.360]  is what mainly drives climate i don't know how many
[2:19:00.360 --> 2:19:04.120]  climatologists and astrophysicists i've got to have on to explain that
[2:19:04.120 --> 2:19:07.720]  but when somebody tells you the sun isn't involved in the temperature
[2:19:07.720 --> 2:19:13.720]  ladies and gentlemen this planet would be below zero
[2:19:13.720 --> 2:19:17.720]  and would be hundreds of degrees below zero in days
[2:19:17.720 --> 2:19:23.560]  if the sun went out we would be as cold as pluto
[2:19:23.560 --> 2:19:27.080]  pluto i forget is pull up the temperature of pluto it's something
[2:19:27.080 --> 2:19:31.240]  like thousands of degrees below zero
[2:19:31.240 --> 2:19:35.000]  you know why because it's thousands of times further out
[2:19:35.000 --> 2:19:39.080]  from the sun and then then our planet is
[2:19:39.080 --> 2:19:43.160]  look at that no sunlight the climate change bbc i just
[2:19:43.160 --> 2:19:47.080]  how dumb do they think we are i'm going to come back and try to go through this
[2:19:47.080 --> 2:19:51.880]  but he said nobody's questioning nobody's no one's questioning climate
[2:19:51.880 --> 2:19:55.640]  change you heard it from him that's another lie
[2:19:55.640 --> 2:20:00.280]  31 000 scientists sent him a petition saying they wanted to talk to him
[2:20:00.280 --> 2:20:05.160]  i mean attention an important product from hemp

[2:24:37.000 --> 2:24:41.000]  you could fry eggs outside on the cement in july in texas but
[2:24:41.000 --> 2:24:44.440]  nothing to do with the sun that heats coming up from a grill underneath the
[2:24:44.440 --> 2:24:49.160]  concrete okay even if you believe that you know
[2:24:49.160 --> 2:24:52.760]  scientists are questioning man make global warming
[2:24:52.760 --> 2:24:57.480]  you know that's a lie now let's go back to his lordship here's obama at the un
[2:24:57.480 --> 2:25:04.600]  is not in doubt i have to be honest as the world watches us today
[2:25:04.600 --> 2:25:08.680]  i think our ability to take collective action
[2:25:08.680 --> 2:25:14.760]  is in doubt right now and it hangs in the balance
[2:25:15.640 --> 2:25:20.440]  i believe we connect boldly and decisively
[2:25:20.440 --> 2:25:27.880]  in the face of a common threat that's why i come here today not to talk
[2:25:27.880 --> 2:25:35.960]  but to act
[2:25:35.960 --> 2:25:43.080]  now as the world's largest economy and as the world's
[2:25:43.080 --> 2:25:49.640]  second largest emitter america bears our responsibility
[2:25:49.640 --> 2:25:54.280]  to a okay so now there's a bunch of america bashing
[2:25:54.280 --> 2:25:58.120]  we're the second biggest polluter china's past us last year
[2:25:58.120 --> 2:26:02.920]  of putting out the most carbon dioxide let's not stop them for putting lead
[2:26:02.920 --> 2:26:07.080]  mercury and melamine in the baby milk and in the medicines and the foods and
[2:26:07.080 --> 2:26:11.160]  all the crud they ship over here let's not have china stop that
[2:26:11.160 --> 2:26:14.600]  let's have them stop putting out carbon dioxide but wait they don't have to make
[2:26:14.600 --> 2:26:19.560]  cuts under this agreement only we do and so more of our industry will
[2:26:19.560 --> 2:26:23.480]  move there but but here he is in front of the
[2:26:23.480 --> 2:26:26.280]  un in front of all these countries bad mouthing
[2:26:26.280 --> 2:26:33.160]  his own country back to obama america bears our responsibility
[2:26:33.160 --> 2:26:37.560]  to address climate change and we intend to meet
[2:26:37.560 --> 2:26:42.520]  that responsibility that's why we've renewed our leadership
[2:26:42.520 --> 2:26:46.920]  within international climate change negotiations
[2:26:46.920 --> 2:26:51.400]  that's why we've worked with other nations to phase out fossil fuel subsidies
[2:26:51.400 --> 2:26:57.240]  all right hit plus what that means is hey we're the u.s is run by the private
[2:26:57.240 --> 2:27:00.520]  banks and the u.s has funded the world government we've been
[2:27:00.520 --> 2:27:05.000]  sucked dry to fund this and we're intensifying our funding to buy all
[2:27:05.000 --> 2:27:08.280]  you third world countries off and most of you presidents and
[2:27:08.280 --> 2:27:12.840]  prime ministers and parliament heads you've all gotten giant cash payments
[2:27:12.840 --> 2:27:18.520]  from us to sell your people out so you've been bought so you deliver
[2:27:18.520 --> 2:27:22.040]  you deliver cutting off the resources and fossil fuels
[2:27:22.040 --> 2:27:25.800]  to your millions of people many of which are living on the edge of starvation
[2:27:25.800 --> 2:27:29.800]  and millions of which do starve you kill your people for the new world order
[2:27:29.800 --> 2:27:33.320]  because that's what dutch roll shell and the queen of england and david rock
[2:27:33.320 --> 2:27:37.560]  feller want that's the translation there back to obama
[2:27:37.560 --> 2:27:41.880]  that's why we've taken bold action at home by making historic investments in
[2:27:41.880 --> 2:27:45.960]  renewable energy by putting our people to work
[2:27:45.960 --> 2:27:49.800]  increasing efficiency in our homes and bodies more lies
[2:27:49.800 --> 2:27:52.840]  they always candy coat their global taxation grid
[2:27:52.840 --> 2:27:56.680]  in electric cars windmills things that sound reasonable but really even those
[2:27:56.680 --> 2:28:00.040]  are boondoggles given to their select friends and buddies as payoffs
[2:28:00.040 --> 2:28:03.480]  that's coming out in the news so that's an inside scam
[2:28:03.480 --> 2:28:06.440]  and then they use all that fake environmentalism
[2:28:06.440 --> 2:28:09.720]  to block out real environmental action real environmental
[2:28:09.720 --> 2:28:12.920]  controls like genetic engineering and things that are truly dangerous
[2:28:12.920 --> 2:28:17.640]  nanotech cern reactors superconducting super colliders
[2:28:17.640 --> 2:28:20.760]  a lot of these super advanced technologies the pentagon admits they're
[2:28:20.760 --> 2:28:23.720]  messing around with anti-matter that's in the
[2:28:23.720 --> 2:28:27.320]  san francisco chronicle oh let's not have any real controls
[2:28:27.320 --> 2:28:32.600]  on stuff that really is dangerous let's just hey you're for the future you're
[2:28:32.600 --> 2:28:35.320]  for renewable energy you know you care don't you
[2:28:35.320 --> 2:28:38.680]  we're gonna go out to break with obama i'm gonna come back and comment on what
[2:28:38.680 --> 2:28:41.160]  he had to say and finish up on the other side
[2:28:41.160 --> 2:28:47.720]  stay with us back to obama by pursuing comprehensive legislation to transform
[2:28:47.720 --> 2:28:53.240]  to a clean energy economy these mitigation actions are ambitious
[2:28:53.240 --> 2:28:58.520]  and we are taking them not simply to meet global responsibilities
[2:28:58.520 --> 2:29:03.240]  we are convinced as some of you may be convinced
[2:29:03.240 --> 2:29:07.880]  that changing the way we produce and use energy
[2:29:07.880 --> 2:29:12.520]  is essential to america's economic future that it will create
[2:29:12.520 --> 2:29:17.640]  millions of new jobs power new industries keep us competitive
[2:29:17.640 --> 2:29:21.640]  and spark new innovation we're convinced
[2:29:21.640 --> 2:29:25.800]  for our own self-interest that the way we use energy
[2:29:25.800 --> 2:29:31.320]  changing it to a more efficient fashion is essential to our national security
[2:29:31.320 --> 2:29:35.880]  because it helps to reduce our dependence
[2:29:35.880 --> 2:29:40.200]  on foreign oil and helps us deal with some of the dangers posed
[2:29:40.200 --> 2:29:45.720]  by climate change so i want this plenary session to understand america
[2:29:45.720 --> 2:29:50.360]  is going to continue on this course of action
[2:29:52.920 --> 2:29:56.760]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[2:29:56.760 --> 2:30:01.480]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[2:30:02.040 --> 2:30:05.560]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar
[2:30:05.560 --> 2:30:09.320]  power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[2:30:09.320 --> 2:30:13.000]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[2:30:13.000 --> 2:30:16.680]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[2:30:16.680 --> 2:30:20.920]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[2:30:20.920 --> 2:30:24.520]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country
[2:30:24.520 --> 2:30:29.000]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[2:30:29.000 --> 2:30:32.840]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[2:30:32.840 --> 2:30:36.200]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[2:30:36.200 --> 2:30:40.360]  power from weather-related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[2:30:40.360 --> 2:30:44.120]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar
[2:30:44.120 --> 2:30:47.880]  power generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors
[2:30:47.880 --> 2:30:52.040]  you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[2:30:52.040 --> 2:30:56.040]  that's mysolarbackup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun
[2:30:56.040 --> 2:31:03.640]  so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365
[2:31:03.640 --> 2:31:07.640]  hi folks this is alex jones i want to tell you about the silver lungs generator
[2:31:07.640 --> 2:31:10.760]  now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[2:31:10.760 --> 2:31:13.800]  and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream
[2:31:13.800 --> 2:31:17.800]  by breathing the solution through the lungs the respiratory system is the
[2:31:17.800 --> 2:31:21.080]  first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses
[2:31:21.080 --> 2:31:24.520]  the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system
[2:31:24.520 --> 2:31:28.920]  with your self-produced nano silver solutions and also delivers
[2:31:28.920 --> 2:31:32.600]  the silver nano particles instantly into the bloodstream
[2:31:32.600 --> 2:31:36.680]  with continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products
[2:31:36.680 --> 2:31:40.200]  you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[2:31:40.200 --> 2:31:44.680]  with the silver lungs generator very easy to follow step-by-step instructions
[2:31:44.680 --> 2:31:47.560]  are provided making production fast and simple
[2:31:47.560 --> 2:31:52.920]  go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough
[2:31:52.920 --> 2:31:59.800]  technology of the silver lungs generator that's www.silverlungs.com
[2:32:02.920 --> 2:32:07.000]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[2:32:07.000 --> 2:32:10.200]  this is our last chance to not relive history
[2:32:10.200 --> 2:32:14.200]  as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath
[2:32:14.200 --> 2:32:17.400]  americans at home i have tremendous influence
[2:32:17.400 --> 2:32:21.400]  on our president and congress and they really are calling the shots
[2:32:21.400 --> 2:32:26.680]  i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[2:32:26.680 --> 2:32:29.880]  fall the republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[2:32:29.880 --> 2:32:34.280]  the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[2:32:34.280 --> 2:32:36.680]  and on its ashes constructing world government
[2:32:36.680 --> 2:32:40.600]  tim geithner, bernanke, they're arsonists they're asking for more matches
[2:32:40.600 --> 2:32:43.080]  and the congress is saying who do we make the checkout to
[2:32:43.080 --> 2:32:47.480]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in washington dc
[2:32:47.480 --> 2:32:52.680]  we have seen a fall of the republic get your copy of fall of the republic on
[2:32:52.680 --> 2:32:56.440]  dvd at info wars dot com we're watching online
[2:32:56.440 --> 2:33:02.360]  right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv
[2:33:07.720 --> 2:33:13.960]  so now obama word for word says what lord christopher montan
[2:33:13.960 --> 2:33:19.640]  yesterday on this radio show said he would say word for word i watched this
[2:33:19.640 --> 2:33:22.760]  live early this morning my mouth was hanging open
[2:33:22.760 --> 2:33:27.560]  i mean word for word we must do this it's a historic global agreement you're
[2:33:27.560 --> 2:33:29.960]  part of this your children are watching
[2:33:29.960 --> 2:33:33.320]  you've got to do this we've had all these years of inaction
[2:33:33.320 --> 2:33:36.600]  which isn't true they're taking over the counties and cities
[2:33:36.600 --> 2:33:39.800]  through the bureaucracies of all the nations including the united states
[2:33:39.800 --> 2:33:44.360]  especially all the different sub regions depending
[2:33:44.360 --> 2:33:47.560]  on how governments break that down in their federal systems
[2:33:47.560 --> 2:33:51.080]  they aren't already implementing all this you know about all the green taxes
[2:33:51.080 --> 2:33:54.520]  you're already paying none of us green it's a robbery
[2:33:54.520 --> 2:33:58.520]  so let's go back to obama as he says we've got to do this
[2:33:58.520 --> 2:34:04.680]  it's historical and then he goes on to say even if you don't sign on the us
[2:34:04.680 --> 2:34:07.880]  is going to fund this and and that will just be private
[2:34:07.880 --> 2:34:12.360]  monitor the imf to go into round two of paying off other countries
[2:34:12.360 --> 2:34:16.360]  that they've already got under debt this is their new way to get even more
[2:34:16.360 --> 2:34:21.320]  debt and more control here's obama to mitigate our emissions and to
[2:34:21.320 --> 2:34:27.160]  move towards a clean energy economy no matter what happens
[2:34:27.160 --> 2:34:31.000]  here in kopenhagen we think it is good for us
[2:34:31.000 --> 2:34:36.920]  as well as good for the world but we also believe that we will all be
[2:34:36.920 --> 2:34:40.760]  stronger all be safer all be more secure if we
[2:34:40.760 --> 2:34:44.280]  act together good pause so there you have it
[2:34:44.280 --> 2:34:47.240]  they're going to make the climate cuts here which is even better for them in
[2:34:47.240 --> 2:34:50.360]  phase one just like the big famous steel mill
[2:34:50.360 --> 2:34:53.800]  they just closed in england the government paid a millions of pounds
[2:34:53.800 --> 2:34:58.440]  millions of us dollars to shut down and move to india
[2:34:58.440 --> 2:35:01.880]  with no emissions controls that's environmentalism
[2:35:01.880 --> 2:35:05.560]  so even if you believe that polar bears can't swim and that carbon dioxide that
[2:35:05.560 --> 2:35:10.040]  plants breathe is a deadly poison this is going to produce more of that deadly
[2:35:10.040 --> 2:35:13.560]  poison here it is that's why it is in our
[2:35:13.560 --> 2:35:17.960]  mutual interest to achieve a global accord in which we agree
[2:35:17.960 --> 2:35:21.640]  to certain steps and to hold each other accountable
[2:35:21.640 --> 2:35:24.600]  to certain commitments
[2:35:26.600 --> 2:35:33.240]  after months of talk after two weeks of negotiations
[2:35:33.240 --> 2:35:38.840]  after innumerable side meetings bilateral meetings
[2:35:39.480 --> 2:35:44.680]  endless hours of discussion among negotiators
[2:35:44.680 --> 2:35:50.840]  i believe that the pieces of that accord should now be clear
[2:35:50.840 --> 2:35:55.320]  first all major economies must put forward
[2:35:55.320 --> 2:35:59.480]  decisive national actions that will reduce their emissions
[2:35:59.480 --> 2:36:03.320]  and begin to turn the corner on climate change
[2:36:03.320 --> 2:36:07.720]  hit pause even if you believe that you in zone cook numbers
[2:36:07.720 --> 2:36:14.280]  all of our evil carbon dioxide may increase the temperature by one degree
[2:36:14.280 --> 2:36:17.320]  and may make the seas rise between seven and 20 inches
[2:36:17.320 --> 2:36:21.080]  nothing and that's been proven to be a fraud the seas are actually slightly
[2:36:21.080 --> 2:36:23.960]  dropping right now and you can just go to any major
[2:36:23.960 --> 2:36:27.640]  coastal relay center online and read their 10 year
[2:36:27.640 --> 2:36:32.760]  numbers on the on the level last five years san francisco's
[2:36:32.760 --> 2:36:37.720]  water level's gone down by a few inches on average but it goes up and down
[2:36:37.720 --> 2:36:43.640]  the point here is that he's saying we've got to have these global emissions
[2:36:43.640 --> 2:36:47.000]  controls all nations must implement this
[2:36:47.000 --> 2:36:51.720]  under this international agreement and then now we have the agreement
[2:36:51.720 --> 2:36:54.840]  it's a tax on all financial transactions and
[2:36:54.840 --> 2:37:00.360]  and a global authority over travel this is a control grid
[2:37:00.360 --> 2:37:07.000]  back to obama i'm pleased that many of us have already done so
[2:37:07.000 --> 2:37:09.960]  almost all the major economies have put forward
[2:37:09.960 --> 2:37:15.000]  legitimate targets significant targets ambitious targets
[2:37:15.000 --> 2:37:18.280]  and i'm confident that america will fulfill the commitments that we have
[2:37:18.280 --> 2:37:21.560]  made cutting our emissions in the range of 17 percent
[2:37:21.560 --> 2:37:26.120]  by 2020 and by more than 80 by 2050 in line
[2:37:26.120 --> 2:37:29.240]  with final legislation
[2:37:29.720 --> 2:37:33.960]  second we must have a mechanism to review
[2:37:33.960 --> 2:37:38.440]  whether we are keeping our commitments and exchange this information in a
[2:37:38.440 --> 2:37:43.160]  transparent manner hit pause that's the global government
[2:37:43.160 --> 2:37:47.080]  just like they attack your country if you try to build your own nuclear reactors
[2:37:47.080 --> 2:37:51.160]  or if you try to have your own central bank they will attack you
[2:37:51.160 --> 2:37:54.680]  over your carbon emissions they will put sanctions on you
[2:37:54.680 --> 2:37:59.560]  and then yes physically attack you physically attack you
[2:37:59.560 --> 2:38:03.160]  that's what this global government is that's why it says global governance
[2:38:03.160 --> 2:38:06.280]  in these treaties i have the treaty right here framework convention on
[2:38:06.280 --> 2:38:09.240]  climate change global governance as they've stated
[2:38:09.240 --> 2:38:12.520]  back to him these measures need not be intrusive
[2:38:12.520 --> 2:38:19.000]  or infringe upon sovereignty they must however ensure that an accord is
[2:38:19.000 --> 2:38:22.040]  credible and that we're living up to our mutual
[2:38:22.040 --> 2:38:26.920]  obligations without such accountability any agreement
[2:38:26.920 --> 2:38:32.600]  would be empty word page i don't know how you have an international
[2:38:32.600 --> 2:38:37.480]  agreement where we all are not sharing information
[2:38:37.480 --> 2:38:41.320]  and ensuring that we are meeting our commitments hit pause
[2:38:41.320 --> 2:38:46.120]  and that was a satellite blip from recording it a tv blip from denmark we
[2:38:46.120 --> 2:38:49.080]  didn't add anything when you can read the transcript for yourself
[2:38:49.080 --> 2:38:52.280]  and there he's saying you've got to have a global institution
[2:38:52.280 --> 2:38:56.440]  to enforce this agreement back to it
[2:38:57.800 --> 2:39:03.960]  that doesn't make sense it would be a hollow victory
[2:39:04.600 --> 2:39:08.680]  number three we must have financing that helps
[2:39:08.680 --> 2:39:13.240]  developing countries adapt particularly the least developed and most
[2:39:13.240 --> 2:39:17.400]  vulnerable to climate change
[2:39:17.400 --> 2:39:21.560]  america will be a part of a fast start funding
[2:39:21.560 --> 2:39:25.320]  that will ramp up to ten billion dollars
[2:39:25.320 --> 2:39:29.800]  by 2012 okay stop right there
[2:39:31.000 --> 2:39:34.120]  they say they're going to help the third world
[2:39:34.120 --> 2:39:38.680]  all these are our imf world bank loans backed up with western tax money
[2:39:38.680 --> 2:39:42.360]  and the loans are given this was going on in 73
[2:39:42.360 --> 2:39:46.280]  under state department random 200 where kissinger's talking about
[2:39:46.280 --> 2:39:50.280]  we give them loans to sterilize their women and to cut off food
[2:39:50.280 --> 2:39:55.800]  and in the future you won't get loans unless you cut the amount of food you
[2:39:55.800 --> 2:40:01.480]  eat this is eugenics this is population reduction
[2:40:01.480 --> 2:40:06.440]  let's go back to the video very hill hillary clinton my secretary of state
[2:40:06.440 --> 2:40:10.760]  made it clear that we will engage in a global effort to mobilize
[2:40:10.760 --> 2:40:14.680]  100 billion dollars in financing by 2020
[2:40:14.680 --> 2:40:20.600]  if and only if it is part of a broader accord
[2:40:20.600 --> 2:40:24.920]  that i've just described all right pause again
[2:40:24.920 --> 2:40:28.600]  what he's saying there is i'll give 100 billion dollars to the third world
[2:40:28.600 --> 2:40:34.680]  that will do it in 2020 10 years after we're taxing you for carbon
[2:40:35.160 --> 2:40:38.360]  do you understand what that means
[2:40:38.360 --> 2:40:43.640]  all right let's go ahead now and go back to the clip
[2:40:44.280 --> 2:40:53.080]  mitigation transparency financing it's a clear formula
[2:40:53.080 --> 2:40:58.600]  one that embraces the principle of common but differentiated responses
[2:40:58.600 --> 2:41:04.920]  and respective capabilities and it adds up to a significant accord
[2:41:04.920 --> 2:41:08.440]  one that takes us farther than we have ever gone before
[2:41:08.440 --> 2:41:11.800]  as an international community
[2:41:12.680 --> 2:41:17.880]  i just want to say to the this plenary session
[2:41:17.880 --> 2:41:21.160]  that we are running short on time
[2:41:21.640 --> 2:41:25.160]  and at this point the question is whether we will move forward
[2:41:25.160 --> 2:41:33.800]  together or split apart whether we prefer posturing to action
[2:41:33.800 --> 2:41:39.880]  i'm sure that many consider this an imperfect framework that i just
[2:41:39.880 --> 2:41:45.000]  described no country will that it wants
[2:41:45.000 --> 2:41:49.000]  there are those developing countries that want aid
[2:41:49.000 --> 2:41:54.760]  with no strings attached and no obligations with respect to
[2:41:54.760 --> 2:41:58.520]  transparency they think that the most advanced
[2:41:58.520 --> 2:42:03.160]  nations should pay a higher price i understand that
[2:42:03.160 --> 2:42:06.680]  there are those advanced nations who think that developing okay that's another
[2:42:06.680 --> 2:42:11.800]  lie we've got the kopenhagen treaty
[2:42:11.800 --> 2:42:14.840]  they're upset because they were told they didn't have to make cuts in the
[2:42:14.840 --> 2:42:17.560]  first world did but they were going to get tax money
[2:42:17.560 --> 2:42:20.840]  now they learn they have to make cuts almost double
[2:42:20.840 --> 2:42:24.600]  it's not quite double almost double what the west has to make and that the
[2:42:24.600 --> 2:42:27.880]  imf and world bank will be collecting all this money and keeping it for
[2:42:27.880 --> 2:42:30.360]  themselves and the third world knows how corrupt those
[2:42:30.360 --> 2:42:34.840]  institutions are so here he is like he's the
[2:42:34.840 --> 2:42:39.800]  arbiter between the first world and the third world in the developing world
[2:42:39.800 --> 2:42:43.400]  you know he's the arbiter when he clearly is a representative of the
[2:42:43.400 --> 2:42:46.200]  anglo-american new world order let's go back to him
[2:42:46.200 --> 2:42:50.280]  but those advanced nations who think that developing countries
[2:42:50.280 --> 2:42:54.760]  either cannot absorb this assistance or that will not be held accountable
[2:42:54.760 --> 2:42:58.360]  effectively and that the world's fastest growing emitters
[2:42:58.360 --> 2:43:02.280]  should bear a greater share of the burden
[2:43:02.280 --> 2:43:07.480]  we know the fault lines because we've been imprisoned
[2:43:07.480 --> 2:43:15.320]  by them for years these are the most energy energy cheap energy has
[2:43:15.320 --> 2:43:20.840]  allowed humans to grow and has lifted a lot of people out of poverty
[2:43:20.840 --> 2:43:24.120]  he's now saying cutting people's energy off
[2:43:24.120 --> 2:43:29.400]  is cutting their bondage off meanwhile governments actually try to block real
[2:43:29.400 --> 2:43:32.760]  technological development and in this treaty it says the un will
[2:43:32.760 --> 2:43:37.000]  decide what new technologies can be funded and developed
[2:43:37.000 --> 2:43:42.520]  so it's also a new dark age let's go back to it
[2:43:42.680 --> 2:43:46.040]  these international discussions have essentially taken place now
[2:43:46.040 --> 2:43:49.560]  for almost two decades
[2:43:49.560 --> 2:43:57.560]  and we have very little other than an increase acceleration
[2:43:58.440 --> 2:44:02.600]  of the climate change phenomena
[2:44:03.000 --> 2:44:08.920]  the time for talk is over this is the bottom line
[2:44:08.920 --> 2:44:13.480]  we can embrace this the time for talk is over you're not allowed to talk
[2:44:13.480 --> 2:44:19.000]  you're not allowed to debate everyone agrees the earth is dying from co2
[2:44:19.000 --> 2:44:22.600]  but everyone doesn't agree so if everybody agrees
[2:44:22.600 --> 2:44:27.560]  why is the time for talk over see we have to hurry and do this right now
[2:44:27.560 --> 2:44:31.640]  finishing up with obama this is the bottom line
[2:44:31.640 --> 2:44:36.680]  we can embrace this accord take a substantial step forward
[2:44:36.680 --> 2:44:41.880]  continue to refine it and build upon its foundation
[2:44:41.880 --> 2:44:45.480]  we can do that and everyone who is in this room will be part of a historic
[2:44:45.480 --> 2:44:51.640]  endeavor one that makes life better for our children and our grandchildren
[2:44:51.800 --> 2:44:59.320]  or we can choose delay there you go hit pause on then that's just
[2:44:59.320 --> 2:45:03.720]  two-year-old level psychology you don't care about your children and grandchildren
[2:45:03.720 --> 2:45:07.880]  if you don't give in to this when in truth cutting off the fossil fuels of
[2:45:07.880 --> 2:45:11.000]  the third world in their own club of rome documents the state
[2:45:11.000 --> 2:45:16.280]  department random 200 is meant to kill people in mass by starvation
[2:45:16.280 --> 2:45:19.320]  which is how mouse a tongue did it and how Stalin did it
[2:45:19.320 --> 2:45:22.920]  this is a death sentence and obama knows full well
[2:45:22.920 --> 2:45:26.360]  what he's doing that's why he's the brown face on this
[2:45:26.360 --> 2:45:30.360]  hoping to sucker the third world into their own death sentence
[2:45:30.360 --> 2:45:34.040]  that's why he was putting power was to sell this that's why it was given the
[2:45:34.040 --> 2:45:37.800]  Nobel peace prize to sell war that war is peace
[2:45:37.800 --> 2:45:42.280]  back to the fraud falling back into the same divisions that have stood
[2:45:42.280 --> 2:45:47.400]  in the way of action for years and we will be back having the stain
[2:45:47.400 --> 2:45:55.800]  stale arguments month after month year after year perhaps decade after decade
[2:45:55.800 --> 2:45:59.640]  all while the danger of climate change grows until it is
[2:45:59.640 --> 2:46:02.360]  irreversible
[2:46:02.360 --> 2:46:08.760]  ladies and gentlemen there's no time to waste
[2:46:08.760 --> 2:46:12.680]  america's made our choice we have charted our course
[2:46:12.680 --> 2:46:16.920]  we have made our commitments we will do what we say
[2:46:16.920 --> 2:46:20.840]  now i believe it's the time for the nations and the people the world
[2:46:20.840 --> 2:46:25.240]  to come together behind behind a car stop right there
[2:46:25.240 --> 2:46:29.080]  that's why obama has told the senate and the house
[2:46:29.080 --> 2:46:33.560]  i don't care if this doesn't get ratified i'm going to implement this by
[2:46:33.560 --> 2:46:37.640]  command and control remember that on monday from the white house
[2:46:37.640 --> 2:46:42.920]  totally unconstitutional he's not a dictator but that's why he said that
[2:46:42.920 --> 2:46:48.040]  obama said that because he's been given his orders
[2:46:48.040 --> 2:46:52.040]  the die is set the u.s has to be the sacrificial lamb
[2:46:52.040 --> 2:46:56.280]  china india mexico and a hundred plus other third world countries
[2:46:56.280 --> 2:47:00.120]  they're not going to make any cuts the u.s is going to sign on to the
[2:47:00.120 --> 2:47:03.400]  agreement that europe's going to sign on
[2:47:03.400 --> 2:47:07.400]  and we're going to have our taxes raised to get more money to the iamf and
[2:47:07.400 --> 2:47:11.400]  world bank to go buy off the third world the third world leaders
[2:47:11.400 --> 2:47:16.600]  to murder their people by starvation real simple and that's what's covered in
[2:47:16.600 --> 2:47:21.080]  eco science written by the white house science are
[2:47:21.080 --> 2:47:24.280]  that's their plan they want to get rid of people
[2:47:24.280 --> 2:47:27.160]  and there's a lot of you out there that think it's the received knowledge that
[2:47:27.160 --> 2:47:31.720]  we've got a reduced world population and that it's the right thing to do
[2:47:31.720 --> 2:47:35.400]  well you go ahead and kill yourselves then do not sit there and and
[2:47:35.400 --> 2:47:38.680]  have a death sentence to these little african children and latin americans
[2:47:38.680 --> 2:47:43.560]  and asians and others and then see american standard of living dropped
[2:47:44.360 --> 2:47:47.960]  there's tens of millions of americans on subsistence right now there's people
[2:47:47.960 --> 2:47:53.000]  that freeze the death every year in this country having their power turned off
[2:47:53.000 --> 2:47:55.960]  this is genocide for all of you people
[2:47:55.960 --> 2:47:59.480]  that have been sold on this being cutesy and cute by the corporate media
[2:47:59.480 --> 2:48:04.920]  you know the corporate media's death what are you doing being sold by this
[2:48:04.920 --> 2:48:09.080]  wake up stop being schmucks stop being fools
[2:48:09.080 --> 2:48:12.680]  stop being idiots let's finish up with obama and i'm skipping this break we're
[2:48:12.680 --> 2:48:17.400]  going to robert wanick go ahead we are ready to get this done
[2:48:17.400 --> 2:48:24.120]  today we're ready to gun america right now movement on all sides to recognize
[2:48:24.120 --> 2:48:29.880]  that it is better for us to act than to talk
[2:48:29.880 --> 2:48:33.400]  it's better for us to choose action over in action
[2:48:33.400 --> 2:48:37.640]  the future over the past see with courage and faith
[2:48:37.640 --> 2:48:40.920]  the third world knows this is going to kill millions of people here people
[2:48:40.920 --> 2:48:46.200]  and people tend to hesitate for they commit mass murder thank you very much
[2:48:46.200 --> 2:48:51.160]  i mean what a load of bull so that's my breakdown of his 10 minute 40 minute
[2:48:51.160 --> 2:48:54.440]  10 minute 40 second speech
[2:48:54.760 --> 2:48:58.600]  and it just i i i could talk for 10 hours about what he's
[2:48:58.600 --> 2:49:03.160]  discussing i spend an hour on each minute going through showing the evidence
[2:49:03.160 --> 2:49:06.440]  of how it's all frauds but why should i have to show evidence
[2:49:06.440 --> 2:49:09.800]  when they say the sun doesn't affect temperature on the earth
[2:49:09.800 --> 2:49:14.040]  when they say penguins and polar bears can't swim and are all drowning
[2:49:14.040 --> 2:49:18.040]  or when they say the ice caps would be gone by this year three years ago
[2:49:18.040 --> 2:49:22.680]  and they're getting bigger or they say any climate change is abnormal
[2:49:22.680 --> 2:49:25.800]  it's nothing but scaremongering to accept world government
[2:49:25.800 --> 2:49:29.160]  run by a private banking system all right i'm done ranting
[2:49:29.160 --> 2:49:32.440]  we only got 10 minutes with robert wanick who's been persecuted
[2:49:32.440 --> 2:49:36.120]  we will be rolling video in the background without audio
[2:49:36.120 --> 2:49:41.160]  of his youtube video where he describes this uh robert wanick great 911 truth
[2:49:41.160 --> 2:49:48.040]  activists great patriot he uh is in high school
[2:49:48.040 --> 2:49:52.200]  and he's won one of our postering contest before
[2:49:52.200 --> 2:49:59.080]  and this time uh he got uh expelled for handing out the actual inserts
[2:49:59.080 --> 2:50:02.280]  that show you what's really in the flu vaccine they admit there's mercury it
[2:50:02.280 --> 2:50:06.360]  can cause gilliam beret brain damage neurological disorders cancer
[2:50:06.360 --> 2:50:10.760]  they don't want that being handed out so he's trying to warn fellow students
[2:50:10.760 --> 2:50:13.880]  in his off time at school and this is what happened to him
[2:50:13.880 --> 2:50:17.480]  robert wanick uh tell us again where you're hailing from and exactly what
[2:50:17.480 --> 2:50:19.800]  happened to him well thanks for bringing me on today
[2:50:19.800 --> 2:50:24.200]  alex um i attend school in breckenridge minnesota
[2:50:24.200 --> 2:50:29.080]  i attend breckenridge high school and every wednesday we have a group
[2:50:29.080 --> 2:50:34.520]  meeting of classes called connection um last wednesday we were given forms
[2:50:34.520 --> 2:50:39.240]  to receive our h1n1 vaccine on wednesday the 16th
[2:50:39.240 --> 2:50:42.360]  i decided to be a great idea if i'd fill out one of these forms
[2:50:42.360 --> 2:50:46.760]  and attend the clinic to educate others of the possible risk
[2:50:46.760 --> 2:50:52.360]  which a school should actually promote um self-education of students
[2:50:52.360 --> 2:50:55.720]  no you're a prisoner you're not allowed to do that you're to keep your mouth
[2:50:55.720 --> 2:51:00.280]  shut and and and only in supermaxes are you not allowed to talk to the other
[2:51:00.280 --> 2:51:04.360]  prisoners so you're in a supermax exactly what's happening
[2:51:04.360 --> 2:51:09.240]  so first step that was taken was my principal called my mom and asked her
[2:51:09.240 --> 2:51:13.480]  if she had signed this h1n1 form knowing that i'm
[2:51:13.480 --> 2:51:19.720]  anti-vaccine she said yes because she supports the the education of
[2:51:19.720 --> 2:51:23.880]  other students who may not may not be aware of the risk
[2:51:23.880 --> 2:51:27.800]  so they were already watching you and didn't know why you were agreeing to
[2:51:27.800 --> 2:51:32.200]  do it exactly they were they were calling my parents well that's what
[2:51:32.200 --> 2:51:36.040]  wardens do you know he's doing his job as a warden go ahead
[2:51:36.040 --> 2:51:39.560]  and so the 16th came this wednesday
[2:51:39.560 --> 2:51:43.880]  and they were calling the juniors down to the science room
[2:51:43.880 --> 2:51:47.000]  to get vaccines from wilkin county public health
[2:51:47.000 --> 2:51:51.080]  they called my name i went down there with about three file folders
[2:51:51.080 --> 2:51:57.560]  of information that simply had the insert of the h1n1 vaccine the
[2:51:57.560 --> 2:52:02.200]  noveritas vaccine yeah you're like somebody into skegee alabama going and warning blacks
[2:52:02.200 --> 2:52:06.920]  not to be injected with syphilis so you're a serious thought criminal you're
[2:52:06.920 --> 2:52:09.560]  going to talk to people who are about to have a medical
[2:52:09.560 --> 2:52:13.400]  experiment done on them absolutely so
[2:52:13.400 --> 2:52:16.760]  my principal was at the door and he said robert you can go sit down
[2:52:16.760 --> 2:52:20.200]  so i went and sat down next to a nurse as soon as she told me to roll up my
[2:52:20.200 --> 2:52:22.840]  sleeve i stood up and said attention i just
[2:52:22.840 --> 2:52:27.080]  want to hand out some information about vaccine risk
[2:52:27.080 --> 2:52:29.960]  i only got a few flyers out before my principal came up
[2:52:29.960 --> 2:52:34.280]  rammed his hand into my lower back and started forcing me towards the door
[2:52:34.280 --> 2:52:38.360]  i said don't touch me i'm leaving he said i'm just escorting you out
[2:52:38.360 --> 2:52:41.880]  he i was out of the room within 30 seconds
[2:52:41.880 --> 2:52:45.560]  but i decided that i couldn't go back to class yet
[2:52:45.560 --> 2:52:49.400]  if these kids had no clue what they were putting in their bodies so
[2:52:49.400 --> 2:52:53.240]  i decided to address the line so i handed out about 30 flyers
[2:52:53.240 --> 2:52:57.000]  one to each kid in line except for the science teacher's son
[2:52:57.000 --> 2:53:00.440]  who refused one and many of them started dispersing and
[2:53:00.440 --> 2:53:04.360]  leaving the line others just said you know i have a choice and
[2:53:04.360 --> 2:53:08.760]  i mean this is real rebellion against tyranny but the science teacher kid
[2:53:08.760 --> 2:53:13.000]  i'm a scientist i don't look at what's in the vaccine
[2:53:13.000 --> 2:53:17.560]  hmm i trust my soviet government go ahead
[2:53:17.560 --> 2:53:20.840]  yeah and so these students started leaving and moments later i heard a
[2:53:20.840 --> 2:53:23.240]  student from inside the vaccine rooms they
[2:53:23.240 --> 2:53:26.520]  i have a choice i don't want it anymore i'm not going to get it
[2:53:26.520 --> 2:53:29.480]  and so they didn't even know they had a choice because all over the country it's
[2:53:29.480 --> 2:53:32.760]  come out they are forcibly inoculating mainly
[2:53:32.760 --> 2:53:36.360]  elementary students because they don't know and the funny part about it was the
[2:53:36.360 --> 2:53:40.120]  nurse actually tried to almost tell him that it was
[2:53:40.120 --> 2:53:43.720]  um it was mandatory excuse me excuse me what did you hear
[2:53:43.720 --> 2:53:46.840]  i heard him say i don't want it i'm not going to take it and she said your
[2:53:46.840 --> 2:53:50.440]  parents signed a form you have to take it and he said i'm not taking it
[2:53:50.440 --> 2:53:53.880]  and he walked out of the room and all you heard was the
[2:53:53.880 --> 2:53:57.000]  public health officials trying to lobby his opinion to keep him in there
[2:53:57.000 --> 2:54:00.680]  saying that but see that's how this works one person says no
[2:54:00.680 --> 2:54:03.720]  and half the people in the line go yeah i don't want it either
[2:54:03.720 --> 2:54:08.440]  they were just intimidated under the group psychology the mob psychology
[2:54:08.440 --> 2:54:13.800]  to do it and and then once once these students started
[2:54:13.800 --> 2:54:17.640]  walking in with these with these printed off flyers
[2:54:17.640 --> 2:54:21.640]  they started asking questions like have you guys heard of this and the nurses
[2:54:21.640 --> 2:54:25.240]  the nurses either want to take the flyers or get these vaccines done as
[2:54:25.240 --> 2:54:28.520]  quick as they could because every single student walked in with one
[2:54:28.520 --> 2:54:32.600]  that's when my principal emerged in the hallway with a law enforcement officer
[2:54:32.600 --> 2:54:35.880]  and said go back to class robert he yelled at me down the hallway
[2:54:35.880 --> 2:54:39.960]  or i'll have you rested and removed from school grounds
[2:54:39.960 --> 2:54:44.040]  and i said i know the policy you can't just override the policy
[2:54:44.040 --> 2:54:48.840]  the policy for being out of class is a detention and i was more than willing to
[2:54:48.840 --> 2:54:53.400]  take a detention to get these flyers out and then
[2:54:53.400 --> 2:54:57.480]  after that i decided i go back to class because i knew that they would
[2:54:57.480 --> 2:55:01.960]  ramp up the punishment but at 130 is when my class ended
[2:55:01.960 --> 2:55:05.240]  and they announced any teachers or faculty that want the vaccine please
[2:55:05.240 --> 2:55:08.680]  report to the science room so the bell rang and me and about five other
[2:55:08.680 --> 2:55:11.720]  students who are educated on the issue of
[2:55:11.720 --> 2:55:15.080]  vaccinations sprinted down to the science room so you came back with
[2:55:15.080 --> 2:55:19.240]  cavalry i bet they didn't like that now you're trying to warn the adults of the
[2:55:19.240 --> 2:55:23.800]  mercury and the cancer viruses i this time i came back with
[2:55:23.800 --> 2:55:27.400]  printed off articles of the 14-year-old student from
[2:55:27.400 --> 2:55:32.040]  from virginia who got gian beret syndrome and i and i started telling people
[2:55:32.040 --> 2:55:35.800]  about how how the wilkin county public health
[2:55:35.800 --> 2:55:39.080]  form the kids were given said there's no link to gbs
[2:55:39.080 --> 2:55:42.680]  and just started raising eyebrows because i had i had an article
[2:55:42.680 --> 2:55:47.480]  that directly links the swine flu to gbs but the public health official was
[2:55:47.480 --> 2:55:51.720]  not about to let me in she actually pushed me as i was going in the door
[2:55:51.720 --> 2:55:54.840]  and then put one hand on each side of the door and said you're not coming
[2:55:54.840 --> 2:55:59.160]  through so i could not get in but what i did was i ducked
[2:55:59.160 --> 2:56:02.840]  and slid under her arm into the vaccine room where the
[2:56:02.840 --> 2:56:06.280]  where some teachers were already were already being vaccinated
[2:56:06.280 --> 2:56:10.040]  i handed out about three or four flyers and the science teacher
[2:56:10.040 --> 2:56:15.000]  comes up to me and i said just let me handle flyers i'm
[2:56:15.000 --> 2:56:18.200]  you can get your vaccine i just want to handle flyers and then i'll leave
[2:56:18.200 --> 2:56:22.680]  he grabs me both hands by the shirt and says get out
[2:56:22.680 --> 2:56:26.440]  and right now i had i had a student with a camera
[2:56:26.440 --> 2:56:30.120]  just for protection in case i would get assaulted
[2:56:30.120 --> 2:56:33.640]  and he goes puts his hands out and says i'm not assaulting you
[2:56:33.640 --> 2:56:37.720]  and proceeds to ram me with his chest to make it look like he's not
[2:56:37.720 --> 2:56:42.680]  assaulting me and he rams me out the door and he notices that there's a student
[2:56:42.680 --> 2:56:45.800]  out there that has a camera he doesn't know if the camera's
[2:56:45.800 --> 2:56:49.240]  filming or not filming but this obviously upsets him because he just
[2:56:49.240 --> 2:56:51.960]  he just broke a lot he just put his hands on a minor
[2:56:51.960 --> 2:56:56.840]  he goes to grab the camera and the student does a handoff to me
[2:56:56.840 --> 2:57:00.360]  i start walking down the hallway with the camera and it takes him a while but he
[2:57:00.360 --> 2:57:04.120]  notices runs up to me and what happened next was something that i
[2:57:04.120 --> 2:57:07.320]  didn't expect to happen i thought he would ask me for the camera
[2:57:07.320 --> 2:57:14.360]  but before asking me he grabs me by my shoulders and says give me the camera
[2:57:14.360 --> 2:57:17.880]  now this is the policy is if you refuse to give
[2:57:17.880 --> 2:57:21.240]  up an electronic device you receive two detentions
[2:57:21.240 --> 2:57:24.760]  now if the school was just and followed their policies this would
[2:57:24.760 --> 2:57:27.880]  this would be definitely worth continuing
[2:57:27.880 --> 2:57:33.400]  by my operation of but this guy is judge dread so he's going to physically punish
[2:57:33.400 --> 2:57:36.120]  you yeah so i said you know you're not getting
[2:57:36.120 --> 2:57:39.320]  the camera give me the two detentions he goes
[2:57:39.320 --> 2:57:43.800]  it doesn't work that way for me he then grabs me from behind
[2:57:43.800 --> 2:57:47.400]  as if he's bear hugging me but aggressively
[2:57:47.400 --> 2:57:50.520]  and begins to jerk me around trying to get the camera
[2:57:50.520 --> 2:57:54.520]  and which leads to me being flung sideways into a locker
[2:57:54.520 --> 2:57:58.840]  i then got free and began to remove the memory card
[2:57:58.840 --> 2:58:02.040]  because i didn't want to be assaulted anymore in the hallway so i figured i
[2:58:02.040 --> 2:58:05.320]  give him the camera and keep the memory card for any footage
[2:58:05.320 --> 2:58:09.240]  and what he did not then was grab my wrist with the memory card on it
[2:58:09.240 --> 2:58:13.640]  grab my wrist hard and say and he said give me the hard drive you're not taking
[2:58:13.640 --> 2:58:16.600]  the hard drive so he wanted the evidence of what he's
[2:58:16.600 --> 2:58:19.880]  done i have a special guest with us in the next hour
[2:58:19.880 --> 2:58:22.840]  but we're gonna come back in one minute while we're getting that guest ready

[2:58:34.200 --> 2:58:38.120]  to stand up against these tyrants because if you let them beat you up
[2:58:38.120 --> 2:58:42.040]  next they'll just intensify the abuse

[3:00:41.160 --> 3:00:44.840]  clearly sunday or monday at the sunday show four to six p.m i'm going to want
[3:00:44.840 --> 3:00:48.360]  you back on because i've been working with you for two three years
[3:00:48.360 --> 3:00:51.640]  you've won some awards from us with your videos and your activism
[3:00:51.640 --> 3:00:54.520]  you've always proven to be very accurate in what you say has happened
[3:00:54.520 --> 3:00:58.120]  so i believe what you're telling me so he ends up taking it away from you
[3:00:58.120 --> 3:01:01.240]  what happens next finish up what happened because you're trying to warn
[3:01:01.240 --> 3:01:05.320]  people about what's really in the vaccine
[3:01:05.320 --> 3:01:09.880]  so what happened next was i he told me to wait in the hallway for the principal
[3:01:09.880 --> 3:01:14.360]  so i i did and there was about 20 to 30 students now gathered
[3:01:14.360 --> 3:01:18.280]  waiting in the hallway just yelling some of them swearing at the teacher for
[3:01:18.280 --> 3:01:21.800]  putting his hands on me and when the principal came down
[3:01:21.800 --> 3:01:25.320]  he asked another teacher who was there the teacher said no he didn't assault
[3:01:25.320 --> 3:01:28.120]  him as a matter of fact he didn't put his hands
[3:01:28.120 --> 3:01:34.680]  on the student this caused just uh an outrage so a total culture of deception
[3:01:34.680 --> 3:01:38.040]  just like cops lie for each other the teachers do this
[3:01:38.040 --> 3:01:41.240]  and the students just started yelling you're a liar i saw you assault robert
[3:01:41.240 --> 3:01:44.280]  you need to get affidavits signed take them to court
[3:01:44.280 --> 3:01:47.960]  i've got i've already got some affidavits signed from over 15 witnesses
[3:01:47.960 --> 3:01:52.520]  good now we've got them online we'll get that other teacher fired for lying we
[3:01:52.520 --> 3:01:57.000]  don't need liars like that and the the other thing is
[3:01:57.000 --> 3:02:00.360]  now we've been trying to i got called in the office at 310
[3:02:00.360 --> 3:02:04.040]  and told that i was receiving a two-day out-of-school suspension for
[3:02:04.040 --> 3:02:10.280]  insubordination and disruption all because you politely tried to hand out
[3:02:10.280 --> 3:02:15.160]  medical information to students that it's not a forced inoculation
[3:02:15.160 --> 3:02:18.680]  they in yes and they instigated violence against me
[3:02:18.680 --> 3:02:22.120]  they caused the disruption and i'm getting charged with
[3:02:22.120 --> 3:02:27.880]  disruption and getting suspended outside of school a three-day suspension
[3:02:27.880 --> 3:02:32.040]  is what is merited by robert let's go back robert let's go back
[3:02:32.040 --> 3:02:35.800]  briefly two three years ago we had a written article about this
[3:02:35.800 --> 3:02:39.880]  uh in uh maryland and i had the state attorney on
[3:02:39.880 --> 3:02:42.840]  and he admitted yeah there's no law you got to take it but they told
[3:02:42.840 --> 3:02:46.680]  2000 parents and kids this they lined up with swat teams
[3:02:46.680 --> 3:02:51.080]  and police dogs and wouldn't let the activists tell them it wasn't the law
[3:02:51.080 --> 3:02:55.560]  and on seeing in mainly black people crying saying i don't want to take it
[3:02:55.560 --> 3:03:00.600]  i get sick when i take it but it's the law you're not even allowed to tell them
[3:03:00.600 --> 3:03:04.760]  it's not the law go ahead absolutely right
[3:03:04.760 --> 3:03:08.360]  when it's not even mandatory when it's voluntary you're not even allowed to
[3:03:08.360 --> 3:03:12.120]  to give them risks peacefully and i was i'm being a
[3:03:12.120 --> 3:03:16.440]  correct and threatened more saying if i release any footage i'll receive more
[3:03:16.440 --> 3:03:18.920]  suspension and they'll possibly recommend
[3:03:18.920 --> 3:03:23.160]  expulsion so so so something to be clear you have witnesses on video
[3:03:23.160 --> 3:03:27.000]  that's up on youtube uh but they're saying if you release any more footage
[3:03:27.000 --> 3:03:30.440]  they're saying outside of school you're not allowed to stand up to them
[3:03:30.440 --> 3:03:33.880]  no any footage from inside the school like if you watch the video i have a few
[3:03:33.880 --> 3:03:37.960]  clips that are from inside the school that i have written consent to release
[3:03:37.960 --> 3:03:41.960]  those are allegedly gonna merit me with with more
[3:03:41.960 --> 3:03:45.400]  well they're just trying to cover up what happened and and and they better
[3:03:45.400 --> 3:03:48.040]  watch it because this is starting to turn into racketeering
[3:03:48.040 --> 3:03:51.720]  so so where are you going from here uh robert i mean i think the way to do it
[3:03:51.720 --> 3:03:54.440]  is now get with a hundred of the of the young men and women
[3:03:54.440 --> 3:03:58.120]  and all of you hand out flyers per class
[3:03:58.120 --> 3:04:01.960]  they won't be able to stop that what you did was bold because it made them show
[3:04:01.960 --> 3:04:04.280]  that they're the tyrants they went after you
[3:04:04.280 --> 3:04:08.120]  now it's the talk of the school now everyone will want the forbidden
[3:04:08.120 --> 3:04:11.640]  literature now you have the school in your hand
[3:04:11.640 --> 3:04:15.960]  as you rebel against the system now you are literally launching
[3:04:15.960 --> 3:04:20.440]  the sons of liberty program what what i'm doing now is pressing charges against
[3:04:20.440 --> 3:04:23.720]  the teacher who assaulted me because the school has not taken
[3:04:23.720 --> 3:04:27.320]  legal action and will not release any security footage
[3:04:27.320 --> 3:04:30.520]  we have no clue if they even still have the footage
[3:04:30.520 --> 3:04:34.040]  on camera you need to put a press release out as you notice there they're
[3:04:34.040 --> 3:04:37.880]  lying you have affidavits and notice their cameras malfunction
[3:04:37.880 --> 3:04:42.040]  we'll talk to you sunday or monday with a more detailed report on this robert
[3:04:42.040 --> 3:04:46.920]  but this is big but i suggest maybe back off for a while
[3:04:46.920 --> 3:04:50.840]  just so you can get back to school and have everyone hand out flyers and
[3:04:50.840 --> 3:04:55.320]  everyone across the nation you should be giving flyers to people in school
[3:04:55.320 --> 3:04:59.320]  instead of just worshiping big government and taking riddling in prozac
[3:04:59.320 --> 3:05:04.200]  robert wanick we salute you this is alex jones and i want to tell you about
[3:05:04.200 --> 3:05:07.560]  the acola blue atmospheric water generator that produces pure drinking
[3:05:07.560 --> 3:05:11.000]  water right from the humidity in the air no this isn't science fiction it's very
[3:05:11.000 --> 3:05:14.600]  real i know because i use one every day in my own home and it's available right

[3:09:02.360 --> 3:09:07.080]  and i mean i know that a lot of people at the office are big
[3:09:07.080 --> 3:09:10.760]  iced earth fans and i know i'd heard the music over the years and really liked it
[3:09:10.760 --> 3:09:13.240]  i don't have a lot of time to get into music in the last decade i'm working
[3:09:13.240 --> 3:09:16.920]  all the time but then i heard the new album that
[3:09:16.920 --> 3:09:21.080]  we were sent it's being released today free online
[3:09:21.080 --> 3:09:25.080]  in coordination with this live radio show and when i heard the music a few
[3:09:25.080 --> 3:09:28.200]  weeks ago i'm like man this is awesome
[3:09:28.200 --> 3:09:32.920]  i mean listen to these lyrics an act of stealth a silent coup d'etat
[3:09:32.920 --> 3:09:36.600]  corrupted leaders hijack freedom acting in duress
[3:09:36.600 --> 3:09:39.800]  and it goes on to talk about the creature from jackall island that's the name of
[3:09:39.800 --> 3:09:42.440]  that track uh it talks about the answer to
[3:09:42.440 --> 3:09:46.200]  1974 1776 and we are going to stand against your
[3:09:46.200 --> 3:09:50.760]  tyranny we are agents of free humanity in the fed in the fed in the fed and it
[3:09:50.760 --> 3:09:55.560]  goes on and on and i know uh that uh the sons of liberty
[3:09:55.560 --> 3:09:59.240]  albums produced separately from iced earth because obviously the record
[3:09:59.240 --> 3:10:03.320]  company wouldn't let them do that uh is just an amazing gift
[3:10:03.320 --> 3:10:07.480]  to those that love liberty and talking about the billboard charts for more than
[3:10:07.480 --> 3:10:11.240]  a decade iced earth's a huge rock man now they're not just
[3:10:11.240 --> 3:10:14.760]  in the top 100 here in the us but the top 100 in canada
[3:10:14.760 --> 3:10:18.920]  number 19 in germany uh a number six in england
[3:10:18.920 --> 3:10:22.600]  number 28 in sweden norway greece austria
[3:10:22.600 --> 3:10:26.120]  finland all over the world ice earth is huge
[3:10:26.120 --> 3:10:29.320]  i think it's safe to say even bigger outside the us and they are in the us
[3:10:29.320 --> 3:10:32.200]  but they're big here and so this is so exciting to have
[3:10:32.200 --> 3:10:35.480]  david mustain come out against the new world order and iced earth and just
[3:10:35.480 --> 3:10:38.360]  more and more people are having these awakenings that's what david mustain
[3:10:38.360 --> 3:10:42.200]  calls it that's what i had uh we were all once
[3:10:42.200 --> 3:10:45.480]  shuttered in not seeing a larger picture and so i'm very
[3:10:45.480 --> 3:10:50.840]  honored uh to to have uh the lead singer here from iced earth the lead
[3:10:50.840 --> 3:10:55.480]  singer from sons of liberty john shaffer here with us today john it's great to
[3:10:55.480 --> 3:10:59.480]  have you well it's uh it's uh it's a great to have
[3:10:59.480 --> 3:11:02.760]  you here as well uh tell us about iced earth sons of
[3:11:02.760 --> 3:11:05.720]  liberty you're awakening why you're releasing this album
[3:11:05.720 --> 3:11:10.200]  for free today and we'll give people the website so they can check out sons
[3:11:10.200 --> 3:11:15.080]  dash of dash liberty dot net well first of all i'm actually not
[3:11:15.080 --> 3:11:18.200]  the lead singer of iced earth um this is the first album i've ever done lead
[3:11:18.200 --> 3:11:21.560]  vocals on and because it's cuts i've just seen some of their songs where you
[3:11:21.560 --> 3:11:24.280]  are singing yeah there's there's a couple that i've done in the past i guess
[3:11:24.280 --> 3:11:27.320]  we were watching last week yeah yeah it could have been the dark hair guy's
[3:11:27.320 --> 3:11:31.880]  singing a lot too yeah uh what's his name um it depends on which period of the
[3:11:31.880 --> 3:11:34.520]  video it was there was that you see that's the thing i saw different people
[3:11:34.520 --> 3:11:39.640]  singing but i saw you singing yeah but anyway the um the the main thing i
[3:11:39.640 --> 3:11:43.400]  think that's important about this is that the the awakening that i had was
[3:11:43.400 --> 3:11:46.280]  about nine months ago and like you i've been working
[3:11:46.280 --> 3:11:50.040]  you know constantly for the last 20 years i mean barely taken any vacation
[3:11:50.040 --> 3:11:52.360]  well finally after the last european tour that we did
[3:11:52.360 --> 3:11:56.040]  i went to central america for a month and then that time
[3:11:56.040 --> 3:12:00.040]  i after about a week i really felt different it was weird it was like
[3:12:00.040 --> 3:12:03.320]  wait a minute you know without all the bombardment of corporate america
[3:12:03.320 --> 3:12:07.800]  everywhere and just it the constant distractions absolutely
[3:12:07.800 --> 3:12:11.720]  and and so it was in that period that i that i really started questioning things
[3:12:11.720 --> 3:12:14.840]  and thinking about things a lot and i get back home and
[3:12:14.840 --> 3:12:18.840]  and i start uh seeing that obama's doing exactly the same things that bush is
[3:12:18.840 --> 3:12:21.640]  doing and and it starts it also starts raising a
[3:12:21.640 --> 3:12:25.240]  lot of questions and um i had somebody sent me the
[3:12:25.240 --> 3:12:29.560]  the zeitgeist at dendem and when i watched that the the money creation
[3:12:29.560 --> 3:12:32.920]  thing it really like i thought at first this can't be
[3:12:32.920 --> 3:12:36.440]  real because i didn't know about the federal reserve i thought like many
[3:12:36.440 --> 3:12:40.680]  people that this was part of government that it was you know a legit
[3:12:40.680 --> 3:12:43.800]  situation well anyway i started doing more research and one thing led to
[3:12:43.800 --> 3:12:46.920]  another and i and it was really i would say um
[3:12:46.920 --> 3:12:50.920]  seeing uh well the creature from jekyll island reading that book
[3:12:50.920 --> 3:12:54.600]  um certainly opened my eyes and then watching the obama deception and i
[3:12:54.600 --> 3:12:57.560]  think that's when i had my epiphany which was really
[3:12:57.560 --> 3:13:01.560]  um it was it was devastating actually at first i mean i felt like i had a
[3:13:01.560 --> 3:13:05.240]  thousand pounds on my chest like everything i ever believed in because
[3:13:05.240 --> 3:13:08.600]  i've always been a huge fan of the revolutionary war period and i'm walking
[3:13:08.600 --> 3:13:11.320]  around my whole life thinking all this stuff is relevant
[3:13:11.320 --> 3:13:14.680]  that it still matters i mean it does matters to those of us that are real
[3:13:14.680 --> 3:13:17.640]  patriots but i mean we've been hijacked and we don't even
[3:13:17.640 --> 3:13:20.760]  know it most of the people don't know exactly what we really are has been
[3:13:20.760 --> 3:13:23.480]  lost and the founders were all about stopping the bankers
[3:13:23.480 --> 3:13:27.320]  they were all about stopping the manipulators and uh stopping the uh
[3:13:27.320 --> 3:13:30.600]  people that set up these monopolies right and and we're not taught what
[3:13:30.600 --> 3:13:34.680]  really why america was special we're not taught with seventy seventy six
[3:13:34.680 --> 3:13:38.360]  really means exactly and i mean and that and that was like it i mean i've
[3:13:38.360 --> 3:13:41.720]  literally broke down and cried i mean it was devastating it was a huge but
[3:13:41.720 --> 3:13:45.240]  it was also you know i started digging more and it was
[3:13:45.240 --> 3:13:48.840]  as angry as i got and as sad as i i've gone through periods where i've been
[3:13:48.840 --> 3:13:52.520]  really you know sad about it i also feel liberated because now it makes
[3:13:52.520 --> 3:13:55.880]  sense you know that's that's the thing that people have to realize
[3:13:55.880 --> 3:13:59.640]  you can't be afraid of this you can't you you have to take this knowledge and
[3:13:59.640 --> 3:14:02.280]  you have to hold on to it and now you know for me it's
[3:14:02.280 --> 3:14:05.720]  liberating to have the truth because i can't i can't actually
[3:14:05.720 --> 3:14:09.000]  go through life with half-truths nobody can you know then
[3:14:09.000 --> 3:14:13.000]  that you don't feel good even if you don't know what the truth is
[3:14:13.000 --> 3:14:17.160]  but you know it's a lie you have this weak feeling but even if something is
[3:14:17.160 --> 3:14:19.880]  horrible that's happening once you know the score
[3:14:19.880 --> 3:14:23.880]  it is liberating it's empowering to know the truth it will set you free
[3:14:23.880 --> 3:14:26.440]  even if you're in a bad situation because then you realize
[3:14:26.440 --> 3:14:29.560]  even if i was still ignorant if i was still in darkness
[3:14:29.560 --> 3:14:33.960]  this corruption was was there all along right but but so many people in the
[3:14:33.960 --> 3:14:36.760]  modern age believe perception is reality
[3:14:36.760 --> 3:14:40.440]  perception is not reality no you know you can have a blindfold on
[3:14:40.440 --> 3:14:43.320]  and think you're walking through a field but really you're walking off the edge
[3:14:43.320 --> 3:14:47.320]  of a skyscraper just because you're blind doesn't mean that you're safe
[3:14:47.320 --> 3:14:51.080]  yeah absolutely yeah i i agree man and i mean that's the that's the thing it's
[3:14:51.080 --> 3:14:54.520]  it's been i i actually feel so much better knowing why
[3:14:54.520 --> 3:14:58.120]  everything is so screwed up because you know you and i understand for people
[3:14:58.120 --> 3:15:01.240]  that it's very difficult to get out of that left right
[3:15:01.240 --> 3:15:04.920]  paradigm i mean for me i've lost friends in afghanistan
[3:15:04.920 --> 3:15:08.120]  and in iraq my little brother did two tours over in iraq
[3:15:08.120 --> 3:15:12.280]  and and he's fine but i mean you know knowing now that this this whole thing
[3:15:12.280 --> 3:15:15.720]  is fraud you know i was i supported it before because i bought into it well
[3:15:15.720 --> 3:15:19.640]  they say 1776 is our military in this empire
[3:15:19.640 --> 3:15:23.400]  but but really that's the exact opposite that's king george the third yeah
[3:15:23.400 --> 3:15:26.840]  absolutely and i see it now for what it is and it's it's just uh i don't know
[3:15:26.840 --> 3:15:30.680]  but that doesn't take away from the heroism the honor of the troops who
[3:15:30.680 --> 3:15:33.880]  believe they're doing a good thing absolutely uh it just means that they
[3:15:33.880 --> 3:15:37.720]  were conned and that's what evil really gets its power from but you know going
[3:15:37.720 --> 3:15:41.000]  over this uh over the bio just hearing the music over the years
[3:15:41.000 --> 3:15:44.760]  i have to say then that's what makes sense i like your sons of liberty better
[3:15:44.760 --> 3:15:48.280]  than ice earth yeah because i was telling the guys i go
[3:15:48.280 --> 3:15:52.760]  i like that i've heard that before you know i mean i wasn't hugely into it but
[3:15:52.760 --> 3:15:55.800]  i listened to you know quite a bit of heavy metal off and on when i heard on
[3:15:55.800 --> 3:15:58.120]  the radio and i was like but i like this sons of
[3:15:58.120 --> 3:16:01.000]  liberty a lot more than iced earth so now i understand
[3:16:01.000 --> 3:16:04.120]  but it does say here i'm trying to get your bio straight that you've been in
[3:16:04.120 --> 3:16:07.400]  iced earth since the beginning yeah i started it okay so you're the founder of
[3:16:07.400 --> 3:16:09.320]  ice dirt that's the that's the thing i wanted to get
[3:16:09.320 --> 3:16:11.800]  straight because i'd seen some of the songs you're singing somewhere you
[3:16:11.800 --> 3:16:16.440]  weren't and i was confused by it but now i'm obviously becoming a lot bigger fan
[3:16:16.440 --> 3:16:20.920]  of ice dirt just because you've created sons of liberty and and folks this is
[3:16:20.920 --> 3:16:25.000]  great great music so so tell us about the awakening
[3:16:25.000 --> 3:16:28.360]  because obviously i'm excited i get too excited sometimes
[3:16:28.360 --> 3:16:31.160]  about your awakening and now nine months later
[3:16:31.160 --> 3:16:35.000]  uh talk about one person doing something you've already launched
[3:16:35.000 --> 3:16:38.280]  uh a free album that you're launching today
[3:16:38.280 --> 3:16:42.440]  that will reach tens of millions of people well we can only hope i mean
[3:16:42.440 --> 3:16:45.480]  the process was like i said at first it was just
[3:16:45.480 --> 3:16:49.000]  i was really devastated and then the more i dug it
[3:16:49.000 --> 3:16:53.240]  the more disturbed i got but i thought i i can't have this knowledge and not do
[3:16:53.240 --> 3:16:55.560]  anything about it i mean the only power i have is music
[3:16:55.560 --> 3:16:58.920]  so i need to i said i got to get my head out of the books for a while
[3:16:58.920 --> 3:17:01.960]  and get into the studio and the first song i wrote was called our dying
[3:17:01.960 --> 3:17:06.360]  republic and it has sort of a uh it's more of a
[3:17:06.360 --> 3:17:10.200]  ballad i guess um i guess at that point i was feeling
[3:17:10.200 --> 3:17:13.960]  more down than i was angry so that some of the aggressive stuff came later
[3:17:13.960 --> 3:17:18.360]  but i decided at that point that that i had to do this i had to
[3:17:18.360 --> 3:17:22.040]  you know do is because i was doing research hours and hours a day
[3:17:22.040 --> 3:17:25.800]  i mean whenever i find out something i that really strikes me i go for it
[3:17:25.800 --> 3:17:29.800]  and so you know and a lot of your films play a big part in that as well
[3:17:29.800 --> 3:17:32.840]  um and i i really recommend people i mean probably
[3:17:32.840 --> 3:17:36.520]  all your viewers have already seen that stuff but if there's ice earth fans out
[3:17:36.520 --> 3:17:39.640]  there that are tuning in for just for this interview they need to check out
[3:17:39.640 --> 3:17:42.840]  in well that's the great synergy is is is my listeners tune into what you're
[3:17:42.840 --> 3:17:45.880]  doing your listeners tune into what we're doing it's that synergy and
[3:17:45.880 --> 3:17:49.560]  absolutely i want to challenge all the ice earth fans all the sons of liberty
[3:17:49.560 --> 3:17:53.560]  fans as this as sons of liberty launches today i'm honored you're here
[3:17:53.560 --> 3:17:57.880]  understand the power of music the power of media and also understand you never
[3:17:57.880 --> 3:18:01.160]  know who you're going to wake up you may wake somebody up who then wakes
[3:18:01.160 --> 3:18:03.320]  somebody up who wakes somebody up like john
[3:18:03.320 --> 3:18:06.920]  schaefer who will then wake up millions of people and that's how we're going to
[3:18:06.920 --> 3:18:09.960]  win this thing as thomas jefferson said the truth is so
[3:18:09.960 --> 3:18:15.960]  much more powerful than a lie and we are setting bushfires in the minds of men
[3:18:15.960 --> 3:18:21.160]  that that that will explosively ignite the world with liberty and you sing
[3:18:21.160 --> 3:18:23.560]  about that in your lyrics and that gets me on fire
[3:18:23.560 --> 3:18:26.600]  yeah man i mean and i hope that there's already we've already seen a lot of
[3:18:26.600 --> 3:18:29.640]  stuff people think that because this is coming out now that it's an anti bush
[3:18:29.640 --> 3:18:31.640]  thing and they've got to get beyond that because
[3:18:31.640 --> 3:18:35.000]  it's these guys are the work for the same people you know i mean and that's the
[3:18:35.000 --> 3:18:38.120]  whole goal is to make to me there's there's so many people that are not
[3:18:38.120 --> 3:18:42.120]  aware of the federal reserve and and that system is
[3:18:42.120 --> 3:18:45.080]  it's the cancer of our land it is absolutely the thing that it doesn't
[3:18:45.080 --> 3:18:48.360]  matter who we elect and i fear as much as as much as um
[3:18:48.360 --> 3:18:51.880]  as i think ron paul would be awesome i would fear for his safety
[3:18:51.880 --> 3:18:54.920]  absolutely we're going to go out to break again with
[3:18:54.920 --> 3:18:58.760]  jekyll island some of the lyrics from that we're going to come back
[3:18:58.760 --> 3:19:04.920]  with a bunch of other great songs like indentured servitude

[3:24:41.560 --> 3:24:45.960]  world order an order in which incredible united nations
[3:24:45.960 --> 3:24:50.680]  can use its peacekeeping role to fulfill the promise and vision of the
[3:24:50.680 --> 3:25:01.240]  united nations

[3:25:13.240 --> 3:25:17.720]  uh men that's actually what uh thomas jefferson said i but down here in texas
[3:25:17.720 --> 3:25:22.840]  brush turns into bush fires uh but uh and you go to the site it's my info

[3:25:36.520 --> 3:25:41.640]  place to do it again i'm just super excited and i hope the listeners
[3:25:41.640 --> 3:25:44.920]  take advantage of this and and then don't go oh this guy could have made
[3:25:44.920 --> 3:25:48.360]  millions of dollars off this like your other albums do uh you know he made it
[3:25:48.360 --> 3:25:51.640]  for us for free uh we're not gonna appreciate this i hope
[3:25:51.640 --> 3:25:54.840]  everybody gets this new album sons of liberty
[3:25:54.840 --> 3:25:58.200]  out to everyone yeah me too i mean that's the the whole point of doing it
[3:25:58.200 --> 3:26:02.280]  they can purchase a higher resolution audio quality for like 799
[3:26:02.280 --> 3:26:05.080]  in the download and there will be at some point physical distribution where
[3:26:05.080 --> 3:26:07.880]  it will be in the store oh that's good to fund yourself we need to do that
[3:26:07.880 --> 3:26:10.840]  yeah i mean exactly because it costs me a lot of money to do this and you know
[3:26:10.840 --> 3:26:15.560]  but i mean that my my thing is copy it if you buy a cd copy it it costs money
[3:26:15.560 --> 3:26:17.480]  for you to fly here to texas to promote it
[3:26:17.480 --> 3:26:23.160]  yeah you know time is really what what cost that too i mean but you know
[3:26:23.160 --> 3:26:27.560]  this is important stuff it's a big deal for me so i mean to spend the time and
[3:26:27.560 --> 3:26:30.840]  i would have been doing another project in place of this had i not
[3:26:30.840 --> 3:26:35.080]  done this record but i decided to you know i everything had to kind of go on
[3:26:35.080 --> 3:26:38.600]  hold well going back 14 years ago i pioneered and not
[3:26:38.600 --> 3:26:41.720]  and i'd know i mean i i wasn't aware of what i was doing
[3:26:41.720 --> 3:26:45.960]  but i did pioneer saying here my film's free and then that actually
[3:26:45.960 --> 3:26:49.800]  woke up a lot of people and created a large listening base which later made
[3:26:49.800 --> 3:26:53.880]  us financially uh you know stable so we could expand a
[3:26:53.880 --> 3:26:57.720]  little bit but again it is important for people uh to support what you're doing
[3:26:57.720 --> 3:27:02.600]  at sons dash of dash liberty dot net we've got links to it up on info wars
[3:27:02.600 --> 3:27:07.240]  dot com this is a short segment but but finishing up uh john
[3:27:07.240 --> 3:27:11.000]  you're awakening so what was the process like building up to then
[3:27:11.000 --> 3:27:15.400]  making this album well basically from the time that i wrote the first song
[3:27:15.400 --> 3:27:18.760]  our dying republic then it it turned into
[3:27:18.760 --> 3:27:22.920]  the idea kind of blossomed into it you know i went into the studio that day i
[3:27:22.920 --> 3:27:25.080]  really literally wrote that song and recorded it
[3:27:25.080 --> 3:27:28.440]  programmed the drums did the vocals of everything in one day i mean i was that
[3:27:28.440 --> 3:27:32.360]  like shook up about it and from that point on
[3:27:32.360 --> 3:27:36.200]  um i just i was thinking you know what can i do what can i do with this and i
[3:27:36.200 --> 3:27:41.640]  just decided to to uh to to go for it and you know make it make it a full not i
[3:27:41.640 --> 3:27:45.160]  guess it is sort of a concept album i mean it's it's certainly the same theme
[3:27:45.160 --> 3:27:48.520]  running through it and it's the song the cleansing wind on there that's about
[3:27:48.520 --> 3:27:52.280]  my uh my trip to central america and how that
[3:27:52.280 --> 3:27:57.160]  um that that was really the the thing that made me realize that
[3:27:57.160 --> 3:28:00.360]  it was kind of the beginning of the breaking free of the matrix you know i
[3:28:00.360 --> 3:28:03.960]  mean being down at a place where you literally are with nature it was just
[3:28:03.960 --> 3:28:07.320]  me and my family spending good quality time together for a month and after a
[3:28:07.320 --> 3:28:10.120]  week or 10 days i physically began to feel different
[3:28:10.120 --> 3:28:12.840]  i'm thinking what is this what's going on and it's just the whole
[3:28:12.840 --> 3:28:17.320]  whole process and so by the time i got home you know i
[3:28:17.320 --> 3:28:21.640]  i knew something was up like it was weird it was just so so you woke up totally
[3:28:21.640 --> 3:28:25.080]  independently before you started searching for more info
[3:28:25.080 --> 3:28:28.520]  yeah there was wow that's really there was that's powerful there was a different
[3:28:28.520 --> 3:28:32.040]  feeling there you know the water was different the whole thing oh yeah no no
[3:28:32.040 --> 3:28:35.800]  i mean it's all the frequency pollution the water they put poison
[3:28:35.800 --> 3:28:39.720]  on record in there uh you know to destabilize people it's the
[3:28:39.720 --> 3:28:43.080]  it's it's it's the flashing lights the signs the
[3:28:43.080 --> 3:28:47.720]  the the busyness how we're all so distracted that we are really programmed
[3:28:47.720 --> 3:28:51.080]  when you get in nature for a couple days it i mean this happens to me
[3:28:51.080 --> 3:28:55.240]  but now i i can almost not take it because then i start really understanding
[3:28:55.240 --> 3:28:59.400]  levels i hadn't and it's just my brain starts moving too quick
[3:28:59.400 --> 3:29:03.000]  i mean for you it was good to wake up out there yeah but now i'm almost scared to
[3:29:03.000 --> 3:29:05.240]  go away to the jungle for two weeks because
[3:29:05.240 --> 3:29:09.560]  because i mean i already know too much and it's just and now
[3:29:09.560 --> 3:29:12.280]  it's starting to get really get spooky right yeah well hey i'm you know and the
[3:29:12.280 --> 3:29:15.880]  thing is that people out there can they can call us kooks all they want
[3:29:15.880 --> 3:29:20.920]  the fact is that the research is there you know do it get informed if you want
[3:29:20.920 --> 3:29:25.080]  to it you can't say the because i honestly i thought a lot of this
[3:29:25.080 --> 3:29:28.360]  stuff that i heard my my father was a john birch guy so
[3:29:28.360 --> 3:29:32.120]  you know when i was a young child i remember certain things that him and
[3:29:32.120 --> 3:29:35.240]  his friends would talk about concerning the united nations and stuff and
[3:29:35.240 --> 3:29:38.360]  and then there was a point where he just didn't talk about it and unfortunately
[3:29:38.360 --> 3:29:42.120]  he died a couple years ago so i can't talk to him now i wish i could
[3:29:42.120 --> 3:29:45.560]  oh so there were those seeds and now 20 30 years later
[3:29:45.560 --> 3:29:49.240]  everything he was talking about is now coming true on the nightly news stay

[3:33:36.040 --> 3:33:42.600]  a chain reaction i have awakened to only question
[3:33:42.600 --> 3:33:53.560]  what i've been led to believe my quest for true liberty
[3:33:53.560 --> 3:34:01.960]  cleansing winds have washed over me and now i'm free
[3:34:01.960 --> 3:34:10.600]  i hold the truth and all that it brings and i will speak
[3:34:10.600 --> 3:34:15.240]  all right ladies and gentlemen we're back that's cleansing wind and again a free
[3:34:15.240 --> 3:34:19.480]  album complete album made by the founder of ice earth
[3:34:19.480 --> 3:34:25.960]  john schaefer available for free at suns dash of dash liberty

[3:34:51.560 --> 3:34:55.240]  fans this will certainly be a another big awakening
[3:34:55.240 --> 3:34:58.920]  and again so many people in hollywood and in music
[3:34:58.920 --> 3:35:03.000]  and in science and in culture are shattering the left right paradigm
[3:35:03.000 --> 3:35:06.440]  look at how the left is coming out now against the health care plan
[3:35:06.440 --> 3:35:10.760]  finding out it was all a big ripoff for banks i mean everything is a ripoff for
[3:35:10.760 --> 3:35:14.440]  banks they control the world anything and everything they do
[3:35:14.440 --> 3:35:18.520]  banker bailouts kioto uh copenhagen
[3:35:18.520 --> 3:35:22.200]  health care it's all going to be a scam just like you said before the break
[3:35:22.200 --> 3:35:25.960]  get past the puppets get to the bankers so continue with your awakening
[3:35:25.960 --> 3:35:29.160]  john schaefer well i wouldn't when you say that too that's that's the thing that
[3:35:29.160 --> 3:35:32.520]  i think infuriates me because i'm i'm a huge supporter of the troops and
[3:35:32.520 --> 3:35:37.640]  and i know that they are um are doing what they believe is right and
[3:35:37.640 --> 3:35:41.080]  and they but the the thing is when you figure out that this is all happening
[3:35:41.080 --> 3:35:45.800]  for uh for a bunch of bankers you know an elitist it's
[3:35:45.800 --> 3:35:49.160]  it's a horrible thing i mean it's just absolutely horrible so awareness to
[3:35:49.160 --> 3:35:52.680]  that institution has got to be it's got to be brought to the forefront if we're
[3:35:52.680 --> 3:35:55.480]  going to have any chance at correcting and that's the
[3:35:55.480 --> 3:35:59.000]  thing about war the guys fighting and dying they are heroic
[3:35:59.000 --> 3:36:03.400]  they are saving their bodies but they've been put in a fraudulent situation
[3:36:03.400 --> 3:36:07.800]  and so they start confusing their heroism with the overall evil and the
[3:36:07.800 --> 3:36:10.760]  government does that on purpose they say look at these troops with their arms
[3:36:10.760 --> 3:36:13.000]  and legs blown off they've got courage
[3:36:13.000 --> 3:36:16.440]  that's only meant to make the system look good right i know i mean but i'm
[3:36:16.440 --> 3:36:18.920]  interrupting continue with your awakening
[3:36:18.920 --> 3:36:22.040]  continue with some of the other songs in the album
[3:36:22.040 --> 3:36:25.800]  um well let's let's run down the list i mean basically
[3:36:25.800 --> 3:36:28.920]  jackall island that's we've talked about that the creature i think everybody
[3:36:28.920 --> 3:36:33.240]  needs to get this book the creature from jackall island it's absolutely crucial
[3:36:33.240 --> 3:36:36.920]  in the whole the whole scheme to understand what
[3:36:36.920 --> 3:36:40.840]  is going on in in our world and i actually just started the
[3:36:40.840 --> 3:36:45.640]  another one of mr griffin's books the the fearful master about the un i mean
[3:36:45.640 --> 3:36:48.600]  that's another institution that needs to get the hell out of this country i mean
[3:36:48.600 --> 3:36:53.160]  you know we we have it's just bad it's just bad in every way you can think and
[3:36:53.160 --> 3:36:56.600]  awareness is the key to figuring this out because they make everything look
[3:36:56.600 --> 3:37:01.960]  um like it's good when it's actually the root cause of everything that's wrong
[3:37:01.960 --> 3:37:05.400]  actually you know in so many ways so i mean we we have to uh
[3:37:05.400 --> 3:37:09.480]  we have to be aware of that and i strongly recommend
[3:37:09.480 --> 3:37:13.080]  people get the creature from jackall island because that book will open your
[3:37:13.080 --> 3:37:17.720]  eyes big time it's thoroughly researched it's fact it's real
[3:37:17.720 --> 3:37:21.160]  and uh so don't tread on me is the next song that's another one we can run down
[3:37:21.160 --> 3:37:25.000]  i mean that that's kind of uh i mean all of these have
[3:37:25.000 --> 3:37:28.040]  obviously the very similar theme they may touch on
[3:37:28.040 --> 3:37:32.760]  um on different points um of of the whole scenario
[3:37:32.760 --> 3:37:37.800]  but that's sort of hopefully with the verses the lyrics and the verses it's
[3:37:37.800 --> 3:37:41.480]  going to make people think a little bit um even if they don't aren't aren't
[3:37:41.480 --> 3:37:44.440]  listening to this show right now and and they don't know but they just hear the
[3:37:44.440 --> 3:37:48.680]  song hopefully they can they can hear the lyrics and we did mix this to where
[3:37:48.680 --> 3:37:52.280]  normally on a metal record i would never mix the vocals this loud but we
[3:37:52.280 --> 3:37:56.200]  my my producer engineer and i thought the message is so important on this that we
[3:37:56.200 --> 3:37:59.720]  really need to you know put it out there and uh
[3:37:59.720 --> 3:38:04.760]  absolutely uh guys i want to go out not with the end of cleansing wind
[3:38:04.760 --> 3:38:08.600]  let's be sure and go out uh with that particularly powerful part
[3:38:08.600 --> 3:38:13.160]  of jackall island where uh it's uh got the clip about
[3:38:13.160 --> 3:38:18.600]  1984 1776 in the fed in the fed and then if we've got time to get the
[3:38:18.600 --> 3:38:23.400]  cd in there perhaps we should play don't try it on me or part of it pick a spot
[3:38:23.400 --> 3:38:26.760]  to play in the middle of this segment because you came all the way to texas
[3:38:26.760 --> 3:38:32.280]  and time is uh running out already so much to talk about but again sons
[3:38:32.280 --> 3:38:38.040]  dash of dash liberty dot net free album launched today
[3:38:38.040 --> 3:38:44.600]  friday december 18th 2009 and you told me that talk about synergy or
[3:38:44.600 --> 3:38:49.000]  synchronicity you were in an airport and somebody walked up to you and said hey
[3:38:49.000 --> 3:38:53.640]  brother check it out sons of liberty a national biker group
[3:38:53.640 --> 3:38:57.640]  who are against the new world order yeah i mean it's just everywhere and and
[3:38:57.640 --> 3:39:02.760]  the last domino to fall is the is is the population people like yourself myself
[3:39:02.760 --> 3:39:06.120]  who are awakened we don't understand we're already pretty much the majority
[3:39:06.120 --> 3:39:09.160]  because the controlled media still has that illusion going that we're the
[3:39:09.160 --> 3:39:12.920]  minority that we're the weirdos no there is a huge
[3:39:12.920 --> 3:39:16.280]  awakening happening right now there is i i mean
[3:39:16.280 --> 3:39:20.600]  i hope it my fear is i hope it's not too late you know that's the only thing i
[3:39:20.600 --> 3:39:24.200]  and i know that there are many people out there many groups out there
[3:39:24.200 --> 3:39:27.320]  uh that are trying to do the right thing and i mean the uh the continental
[3:39:27.320 --> 3:39:31.160]  congress that went on this past november that that's a good step in the right
[3:39:31.160 --> 3:39:35.720]  direction um it's just that it's you know i really
[3:39:35.720 --> 3:39:38.040]  worry about the sovereignty of our country and all the countries on the
[3:39:38.040 --> 3:39:40.920]  planet you know i mean it this is this very disturbing
[3:39:40.920 --> 3:39:45.240]  stuff that's happening here so you know but awareness is certainly i mean if
[3:39:45.240 --> 3:39:49.480]  good people don't don't know what's going on then there
[3:39:49.480 --> 3:39:53.080]  certainly is no hope so they can call me a kook they can call you kook they can
[3:39:53.080 --> 3:39:55.960]  do whatever they want but we're going to get through to some people
[3:39:55.960 --> 3:39:58.520]  well i mean the denial is over though open world
[3:39:58.520 --> 3:40:01.720]  governments being announced for sure they're just saying we're your savior
[3:40:01.720 --> 3:40:05.800]  world governments good and thank god we've been there people like your dad
[3:40:05.800 --> 3:40:10.280]  warning people decades ago about the truth they got laughed at then but
[3:40:10.280 --> 3:40:13.880]  because those seeds were planted uh we have a good fighting chance now
[3:40:13.880 --> 3:40:17.800]  because of the people's shoulders we stand on yeah i guess the the thing for
[3:40:17.800 --> 3:40:21.640]  me is that even if we find good politicians to send into the place and
[3:40:21.640 --> 3:40:25.320]  that's sort of an oxymoron isn't a good politician but i mean there are a few
[3:40:25.320 --> 3:40:28.920]  and and if we if we find to send them and we get them into
[3:40:28.920 --> 3:40:32.040]  office you know how long are they going to stay good how
[3:40:32.040 --> 3:40:34.600]  long are they going to stay safe you know these are the things yeah we're
[3:40:34.600 --> 3:40:38.280]  dealing with a criminal regime that kills people yeah but once we've
[3:40:38.280 --> 3:40:41.960]  identified the real regime killing people won't cut it anymore it's like
[3:40:41.960 --> 3:40:44.760]  chelcescu and romania it will finally fall
[3:40:44.760 --> 3:40:48.680]  yeah well and that's why that's why i'm doing
[3:40:48.680 --> 3:40:53.560]  this because i think if i can help in some small way with this stuff then
[3:40:53.560 --> 3:40:57.480]  you know it's uh it's worth doing by the way uh the sons of liberty
[3:40:57.480 --> 3:41:01.480]  website is awesome news site with links and information
[3:41:01.480 --> 3:41:05.240]  uh and and you've got other sections like meet the shackles
[3:41:05.240 --> 3:41:08.840]  what happens when you meet the shackles well it's a little bit of a sarcastic
[3:41:08.840 --> 3:41:13.640]  twist on how the new world order would view the sons of liberty
[3:41:13.640 --> 3:41:17.160]  thing and so people need to click on the sons of liberty logo and then go down
[3:41:17.160 --> 3:41:21.000]  and meet the shackles and a good friend of mine and serri evo
[3:41:21.000 --> 3:41:25.080]  actually came up with this concept i mean we had the idea of the the slavery
[3:41:25.080 --> 3:41:28.200]  thing a buddy of mine that that does a lot of
[3:41:28.200 --> 3:41:32.120]  artwork for ice earth that we came up with but he came up
[3:41:32.120 --> 3:41:36.120]  with the shackles and it's it's really cool it's it's basically a
[3:41:36.120 --> 3:41:40.360]  uh a system that you know for locking up patriots where you have these handcuff
[3:41:40.360 --> 3:41:44.920]  type things that that resemble uh the dollar bill and the
[3:41:44.920 --> 3:41:48.840]  the dollar sign and the infinity sign and then you know you ram these spikes
[3:41:48.840 --> 3:41:52.680]  through and that gives it this it's pretty twisted no it's powerful it
[3:41:52.680 --> 3:41:55.480]  it works you know what's funny i hadn't asked you what that meant but when i
[3:41:55.480 --> 3:41:59.000]  looked at it that's what i picked up is this is
[3:41:59.000 --> 3:42:03.640]  eternity jail bars and a key which is the idea
[3:42:03.640 --> 3:42:06.440]  of you can get freedom anytime you want there's a key
[3:42:06.440 --> 3:42:11.320]  you've just got to discover it and uh the only part i missed was the spikes
[3:42:11.320 --> 3:42:14.760]  through the wrist but i guess your wrist if you turn it turn it vertically
[3:42:14.760 --> 3:42:18.600]  no it looks more like the dollar sign that way wow that is a powerful symbol
[3:42:18.600 --> 3:42:20.840]  you know what i mean so that's so it's your buddy's a good artist
[3:42:20.840 --> 3:42:23.240]  he is i mean did you come up with that or the guy in serri evo
[3:42:23.240 --> 3:42:26.360]  the guy in serri evo came up with that with that concept and i was like you
[3:42:26.360 --> 3:42:30.680]  know this is awesome and and it's so it works perfect it's a really well listen
[3:42:30.680 --> 3:42:33.560]  i don't want to just sit here and throw questions at you and i want to play
[3:42:33.560 --> 3:42:37.000]  part of don't tread on me and then go out with my favorite song
[3:42:37.000 --> 3:42:40.760]  uh of course the creature from jekyll island but while you're here john
[3:42:40.760 --> 3:42:43.800]  shaper founder of ice girth now the founder of sons of liberty
[3:42:43.800 --> 3:42:46.600]  and and the new album brush fires the minds of men
[3:42:46.600 --> 3:42:49.640]  uh points you'd like to make to the millions of people that are going to
[3:42:49.640 --> 3:42:53.880]  tune into this uh the biggest point is just don't be in
[3:42:53.880 --> 3:42:57.240]  denial don't put your head back in the sand you know do the research
[3:42:57.240 --> 3:43:01.560]  and trust your gut instinct if it feels like it's true it probably is and i
[3:43:01.560 --> 3:43:03.640]  mean that because there's a lot of misinformation out there on the
[3:43:03.640 --> 3:43:05.640]  internet and that's the thing man i didn't even
[3:43:05.640 --> 3:43:09.240]  back years ago because of of my intense schedule and stuff the only thing i
[3:43:09.240 --> 3:43:13.560]  used the internet for was for email you know i never really went out on the
[3:43:13.560 --> 3:43:17.080]  websites and did all that stuff and and since i've awakened
[3:43:17.080 --> 3:43:20.280]  there there is a lot of stuff out there that i figures yeah you know it's
[3:43:20.280 --> 3:43:23.640]  questionable but i i'm in tune with my gut
[3:43:23.640 --> 3:43:27.320]  and when i see something and it resonates then i go with it
[3:43:27.320 --> 3:43:30.280]  and and that because i can't use i certainly can't trust fox news or
[3:43:30.280 --> 3:43:34.360]  see and now that you've gone public i told you all fair
[3:43:34.360 --> 3:43:37.640]  people are going to try to bait you and say things that aren't true about you
[3:43:37.640 --> 3:43:41.080]  just to get you to respond to them so that you burn your energy
[3:43:41.080 --> 3:43:45.000]  proving you're not a bad guy ignore them but you were a smart guy and go yeah
[3:43:45.000 --> 3:43:48.440]  looks i already know that yeah they they've been doing that anyway just for
[3:43:48.440 --> 3:43:51.880]  over band crap you know what i mean but this uh this is a whole another level
[3:43:51.880 --> 3:43:54.200]  so i'm prepared for it and i'm not i you know what
[3:43:54.200 --> 3:43:58.600]  i will not live in fear living in fear or living a life without liberty is like
[3:43:58.600 --> 3:44:00.760]  a prison sentence sure i was just warning you like i
[3:44:00.760 --> 3:44:04.120]  warned every other prominent person that really stands up get ready for the
[3:44:04.120 --> 3:44:08.120]  first trick the first dart of the devil uh and i see
[3:44:08.120 --> 3:44:11.560]  so many great people who then get diverted by it and as soon as you bite
[3:44:11.560 --> 3:44:14.920]  oh then it's like piranhas yeah now i'm not gonna play that game
[3:44:14.920 --> 3:44:17.320]  not gonna happen so i'm really not even warning you i'm warning the audience
[3:44:17.320 --> 3:44:20.360]  out there but uh it's all little lessons and of course i
[3:44:20.360 --> 3:44:24.040]  learn more all the time i just want people to relive what i had to trial and
[3:44:24.040 --> 3:44:27.960]  error experience yeah but other points you'd like to make
[3:44:27.960 --> 3:44:32.040]  well i mean uh for the ice earth fans out there we're gonna be touring south
[3:44:32.040 --> 3:44:37.160]  america next month um we uh actually yeah january late january into
[3:44:37.160 --> 3:44:40.200]  february um and um you know we'll be working on a
[3:44:40.200 --> 3:44:44.600]  new record soon after that so as far as sons of liberty goes um
[3:44:44.600 --> 3:44:48.280]  you know it's it's all brand new the website is brand new we still have a
[3:44:48.280 --> 3:44:50.920]  lot of work that we want to do to it but we wanted to get i wanted to get this
[3:44:50.920 --> 3:44:54.120]  out as soon as possible i mean the the copenhagen thing was really disturbing
[3:44:54.120 --> 3:44:57.000]  me so i wanted to get i would like to have had it out a few weeks ago i
[3:44:57.000 --> 3:45:00.040]  couldn't do it last week when you wanted to but luckily you weren't ready so
[3:45:00.040 --> 3:45:03.560]  that this week was perfect yeah yeah i mean i just wanted but i wish i could
[3:45:03.560 --> 3:45:06.520]  have the production done sooner all in general because i know i know that
[3:45:06.520 --> 3:45:09.880]  feeling i constantly want to make more films and because because once you start
[3:45:09.880 --> 3:45:13.720]  getting into it for me it's so fulfilling to know the truth and to be
[3:45:13.720 --> 3:45:17.880]  opposing the corruption that it it does consume you i mean are you not
[3:45:17.880 --> 3:45:20.520]  feeling more fulfilled i mean i mean you look like a pretty fulfilled guy
[3:45:20.520 --> 3:45:23.560]  already absolutely i mean like i said i feel
[3:45:23.560 --> 3:45:27.240]  it makes sense now everything makes sense you know and it's i can deal with
[3:45:27.240 --> 3:45:32.120]  the truth and i prefer to so i feel liberated and happier and almost it's
[3:45:32.120 --> 3:45:35.800]  like yeah it's heavy to know this but it's also
[3:45:35.800 --> 3:45:39.320]  liberating to know this because now all of the things that you
[3:45:39.320 --> 3:45:43.000]  that you wonder why why is it this way why does it have to be this way well
[3:45:43.000 --> 3:45:46.120]  when you know then you can work on solving it
[3:45:46.120 --> 3:45:49.320]  i love this line from creature from jekyll island
[3:45:49.320 --> 3:45:52.600]  where you say we are agents of free humanity
[3:45:52.600 --> 3:45:56.280]  and and and that's it it's not welcome to the club or you know welcome to the
[3:45:56.280 --> 3:46:00.280]  you know to our group no it's welcome to i'm a sentient free being i want the
[3:46:00.280 --> 3:46:04.200]  truth whatever it is so i want to say welcome to
[3:46:04.200 --> 3:46:08.280]  free humanity welcome to being an agent of a free agent of liberty you got it
[3:46:08.280 --> 3:46:11.480]  brother it's awesome to have here let's play a part of and people can hear the
[3:46:11.480 --> 3:46:15.320]  whole thing uh at the sons of liberty website but let's
[3:46:15.320 --> 3:46:17.960]  play a little bit a minute or so or two minutes
[3:46:17.960 --> 3:46:21.080]  of don't tread on me that we're going to go out with creature from jekyll
[3:46:21.080 --> 3:46:47.880]  island here it is
[3:46:47.880 --> 3:46:52.360]  are you a free spirit or asleep
[3:46:52.360 --> 3:46:56.760]  are the institutions that have molded our minds
[3:46:56.760 --> 3:47:10.040]  pushing an agenda filled with lies
[3:47:10.040 --> 3:47:14.360]  have you ever asked yourself why things never change
[3:47:14.360 --> 3:47:18.840]  the rhetoric they speak is all the same
[3:47:18.840 --> 3:47:23.480]  the men behind the curtain and the illusion they create
[3:47:23.480 --> 3:47:29.240]  full of puppet strength and seal our fate
[3:47:29.240 --> 3:47:36.760]  watch yourself around me i'm trying to live
[3:47:36.760 --> 3:47:42.840]  free push to fall we will strike
[3:47:42.840 --> 3:47:47.000]  like a snake corner in the night
[3:47:47.000 --> 3:47:50.280]  watch yourself around me
[3:47:50.280 --> 3:47:54.520]  john shaffer is our guest you know what i like john is that
[3:47:54.520 --> 3:47:58.600]  there is you're showing so much range here and i think now you need to be the
[3:47:58.600 --> 3:48:02.120]  lead singer of ice dirt not just the founder i'm not i'm not knocking your
[3:48:02.120 --> 3:48:05.400]  other lead singer he sounds great but i mean there's a lot of range these
[3:48:05.400 --> 3:48:10.040]  songs you know sound different from each other i mean you have a lot of uh
[3:48:10.040 --> 3:48:13.000]  i mean not just talent obviously but a huge range
[3:48:13.000 --> 3:48:16.280]  i i don't even know where it came from i mean i always heard this stuff in my
[3:48:16.280 --> 3:48:18.600]  head but actually i don't have the range that
[3:48:18.600 --> 3:48:21.720]  that i would like to have and that's one of the reasons that i never even
[3:48:21.720 --> 3:48:25.160]  considered doing vocals in ice dirt well i'm in range of styles not just range
[3:48:25.160 --> 3:48:27.960]  of voice okay well i mean i mean different
[3:48:27.960 --> 3:48:32.040]  genres sounds of heavy metal or i mean that that song is great
[3:48:32.040 --> 3:48:35.080]  yeah there's a lot of there's a lot of different vibes too and i mean ice
[3:48:35.080 --> 3:48:38.200]  dirt's got a huge catalog and there's a lot of different vibes in it but
[3:48:38.200 --> 3:48:41.640]  i'm not a musician so i'll use all the wrong terms now it's okay no range with
[3:48:41.640 --> 3:48:45.080]  voices i mean i meant just different whole different sounds
[3:48:45.080 --> 3:48:49.080]  yeah it does i mean i used a different for indentured servitude i used a
[3:48:49.080 --> 3:48:53.000]  telecaster through a low watt amp that i've never done that before on any ice
[3:48:53.000 --> 3:48:56.760]  dirt record but it just it felt right you know so it's like there's there's some
[3:48:56.760 --> 3:49:00.840]  different experimental things going on here we're gonna go out with my favorite

[3:55:28.920 --> 3:55:33.880]  you've got the floor uh john schaefer founder of isterth and sons of liberty
[3:55:33.880 --> 3:55:38.920]  launching his free album today for you take advantage of it folks a new weapon
[3:55:38.920 --> 3:55:43.400]  in the info war john schaefer i guess my my biggest thing is that i'm
[3:55:43.400 --> 3:55:47.960]  pleading for people to be open-minded you know about this and to
[3:55:47.960 --> 3:55:53.080]  get try to break free from the left right paradigm because it's a fraud
[3:55:53.080 --> 3:55:56.600]  you know i don't care about the rhetoric you know that don't don't trust what
[3:55:56.600 --> 3:56:00.600]  these people say you need to watch what they do you need to watch their actions
[3:56:00.600 --> 3:56:07.320]  and it's becoming more and more clear to me that uh that things are clearly not
[3:56:07.320 --> 3:56:12.360]  what they seem so i i'm just begging people to think outside of the box a
[3:56:12.360 --> 3:56:16.280]  little bit you know learn learn what it means to be an american
[3:56:16.280 --> 3:56:21.240]  you know study the constitution go back study the founders look they warned us
[3:56:21.240 --> 3:56:23.960]  everywhere about this exact thing that's going on
[3:56:23.960 --> 3:56:27.400]  i mean your dad warned us you're talking about your dad when you were a kid
[3:56:27.400 --> 3:56:30.920]  talking about this yeah yeah and i mean i was really young then and at some
[3:56:30.920 --> 3:56:34.440]  point i think maybe the burden was a little bit too much and he just didn't
[3:56:34.440 --> 3:56:38.600]  talk about it maybe stopped getting involved in it i'm not sure about that
[3:56:38.600 --> 3:56:42.280]  i just remember at some point we didn't you know i didn't hear about it that
[3:56:42.280 --> 3:56:45.560]  kind of stuff anymore but i know there that he had big concerns i mean i
[3:56:45.560 --> 3:56:49.000]  remember him you know we'd go into a department store maybe it was
[3:56:49.000 --> 3:56:51.800]  christmas shopping or whatever and they would the cashier would ask for his
[3:56:51.800 --> 3:56:55.320]  social security number and he would just like go off you know i mean he he was
[3:56:55.320 --> 3:56:58.040]  not a big fan of of this whole control he understood it
[3:56:58.040 --> 3:57:01.560]  i remember bobby vaughn since died of a brain tumor friends of my dad coming
[3:57:01.560 --> 3:57:05.560]  over popping a six pack of beer after work when i was like five six seven and
[3:57:05.560 --> 3:57:08.520]  talking about the new world order and the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers and
[3:57:08.520 --> 3:57:11.400]  the global currency and the and how they were going to tax everything
[3:57:11.400 --> 3:57:15.160]  environmentally and it they had all the documents and of course my dad
[3:57:15.160 --> 3:57:18.440]  wasn't really a member of the jbs in high school he'd given some speeches to
[3:57:18.440 --> 3:57:22.040]  conservative groups but i remember the jbsers coming over to the house
[3:57:22.040 --> 3:57:26.120]  and so i i i think those are seeds again that were planted that later
[3:57:26.120 --> 3:57:29.800]  awakened yeah yeah i mean and you know you go back and
[3:57:29.800 --> 3:57:33.160]  watch what robert welch said in the 70s you know like
[3:57:33.160 --> 3:57:36.520]  warning and and it's happening it's what they're doing
[3:57:36.520 --> 3:57:40.680]  so notice how they get attacked by people by co-intel pros saying they're feds
[3:57:40.680 --> 3:57:45.320]  now judge a tree by its fruits the jbs has done a great job absolutely and i'm
[3:57:45.320 --> 3:57:49.160]  i'm gonna be joining that society here shortly so
[3:57:49.160 --> 3:57:53.240]  um because i i just think that it's this whole thing it's
[3:57:53.240 --> 3:57:57.000]  you gotta give it to him it's ingenious you know there's no doubt
[3:57:57.000 --> 3:58:01.560]  and um they have pulled off something that uh
[3:58:01.560 --> 3:58:04.520]  i think we're living in the most historic times on on the planet actually
[3:58:04.520 --> 3:58:08.440]  right now i mean this is big stuff and people we're actually blessed to be alive
[3:58:08.440 --> 3:58:11.320]  now i said i agree i mean god test us man this is our
[3:58:11.320 --> 3:58:13.880]  medal we're giving all this decadence to make us stand down
[3:58:13.880 --> 3:58:17.640]  while this scientific dictatorship comes in will we have the strength to
[3:58:17.640 --> 3:58:21.960]  wake up and put it down and slay the dragon i i think we do and i actually
[3:58:21.960 --> 3:58:25.720]  you know the funny thing is i always in interviews when people would ask me
[3:58:25.720 --> 3:58:29.000]  if you could time travel where would you go and i was said to the american
[3:58:29.000 --> 3:58:32.680]  revolution i i've been i felt like i was born in the wrong
