[00:47.000 --> 00:50.960]  that Homeland Security is looking at making this the main Guantanamo Bay
[00:50.960 --> 00:57.520]  West the CNN has called it there are so many angles and facets to this story
[00:57.520 --> 01:03.760]  we've now had a chance to talk to locals who actually have homes that order the
[01:03.760 --> 01:10.600]  27 million dollar facility that was built two years ago and it's very secret
[01:10.600 --> 01:17.280]  very secretive who owns it who runs it who's leasing it I've talked to locals
[01:17.280 --> 01:22.760]  they say that the Germans that are here the Serbs that are here the Brits that
[01:22.760 --> 01:28.760]  are here and other Eastern Europeans that are here at the facility will talk to
[01:28.760 --> 01:33.280]  no one and will not say why they're here but I talked to some locals who have a
[01:33.280 --> 01:38.680]  home literally bordering the camp because it's right off downtown some of
[01:38.680 --> 01:44.520]  the historic Victor the Victorian homes here and they said that they know this
[01:44.520 --> 01:52.480]  Mr. Hilton who goes by Michael Hilton the Billings Gazette is reporting yesterday
[01:52.480 --> 01:59.520]  and today that Hilton has three different aliases and is actually from
[01:59.520 --> 02:07.600]  Montenegro in the Balkans in Serbia they of course really free people out last
[02:07.600 --> 02:12.000]  week when they started having black SUVs patrol town the city of Hardin that
[02:12.000 --> 02:17.840]  said Hardin police force national police force and here is the Billings
[02:17.840 --> 02:22.720]  Gazette in front of me today the actual newspaper American police force

[02:46.040 --> 02:54.120]  Hilton he has Muslim surnames Serb Serb surnames very very shadowy character
[02:54.120 --> 02:59.160]  hooked up with Homeland Security we've confirmed with locals that there are
[02:59.160 --> 03:04.440]  constant black SUVs constant black Humvees as we've had calls in the last few days
[03:04.440 --> 03:09.120]  on air about that black Hawk helicopters have been hovering in and around town
[03:09.120 --> 03:15.080]  the last year landing and taking off near the base it is literally spook
[03:15.080 --> 03:20.040]  central here ladies and gentlemen so here's what we know in the last year a
[03:20.040 --> 03:24.400]  very secretive organization known as American police force that claims it can
[03:24.400 --> 03:29.440]  land a battalion of special forces troops within 24 hours anywhere in the
[03:29.440 --> 03:37.200]  world has arrived with Homeland Security vehicles as well and they have taken
[03:37.200 --> 03:42.720]  over the $27 million facility that it was built two years ago and never held
[03:42.720 --> 03:47.440]  prisoners we also talked to locals there's a British architect here that's
[03:47.440 --> 03:50.640]  also admitted by the group they're planning on expanding the camp and they
[03:50.640 --> 03:54.040]  say it's going to be a mercenary training center a quote contractor combat
[03:54.040 --> 03:58.280]  troops training center for at least 5,000 troops they say in the next month
[03:58.280 --> 04:03.400]  quote everything will be made public and that thousands of personnel are going
[04:03.400 --> 04:08.800]  to be arriving here they have hundreds of personnel right now here in the town
[04:08.800 --> 04:15.000]  there's this shadowy two rivers development corporation that that's
[04:15.000 --> 04:20.080]  basically running the town of Hardin the poorest town around 4,000 people the
[04:20.080 --> 04:25.400]  poorest town in Montana listed by the state the state has been trying to find
[04:25.400 --> 04:29.800]  out for years what's going on out here but because it borders part of the town
[04:29.800 --> 04:34.800]  is on the road and in reservation the other half isn't so it's kind of a no
[04:34.800 --> 04:41.160]  man's land here so just very very bizarre situation that we're going to be
[04:41.160 --> 04:44.600]  covering I'm gonna go over to the camp and start asking for questions city
[04:44.600 --> 04:48.600]  officials in the next two hours and then in the third hour of the radio show

[08:06.040 --> 08:13.400]  information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network we are
[08:13.400 --> 08:16.920]  back it's the Alex Jones show I am Jason Bermas sitting in we're going to be
[08:16.920 --> 08:20.760]  going over the latest vaccination news including the military losing yet another
[08:20.760 --> 08:25.240]  battle against mandatory anthrax vaccinations but right now we go back to
[08:25.240 --> 08:31.760]  Alex Jones in hardened Montana at the scene of the FEMA camp absolutely I
[08:31.760 --> 08:37.120]  am an occupied Montana occupied by a shadowy mercenary organization out of
[08:37.120 --> 08:41.440]  Serbia that is confirmed now in the Billings Gazette in two separate
[08:41.440 --> 08:49.200]  articles one yesterday now one day on Thursday October 1st 2009 we are live
[08:49.200 --> 08:53.360]  headline in the Billings Gazette top story American police force official
[08:53.360 --> 08:57.840]  Hilton has history of legal trouble but just to correct myself it's not
[08:57.840 --> 09:01.640]  Grand Theft Auto it's putting guilty to Grand Theft and attempted Grand Theft
[09:01.640 --> 09:06.640]  period and diverting construction for funds that looks like that's his
[09:06.640 --> 09:11.360]  specialty is getting into contracts and then and running scams there he's
[09:11.360 --> 09:17.160]  pled guilty to 14 felonies and 1993 uses at least three different aliases
[09:17.160 --> 09:22.640]  Barmas give us his reported real name from Serbia well they're saying he's
[09:22.640 --> 09:26.760]  got two aliases with the last surname Dakovic which would lead me to believe
[09:26.760 --> 09:30.280]  that that's probably his real name they don't really tell you what his actual
[09:30.280 --> 09:36.440]  name is the two aliases of Dakovic are Mio Miro drag and midrag Ilya so
[09:36.440 --> 09:39.840]  obviously this hat this guy's a foreigner I mean it's unbelievable we have
[09:39.840 --> 09:46.280]  private mercenaries on the street headed up by a form a foreign mercenary who
[09:46.280 --> 09:51.400]  was pleaded guilty to over 14 felonies Alex I want to be clear I don't know
[09:51.400 --> 09:57.000]  where sources but it there's quite a few hotels right around the FEMA camp so I
[09:57.000 --> 10:02.080]  went in this morning and questioned been doing some gum shoe shoe other work
[10:02.080 --> 10:06.000]  here detective work I just went in and point blank said I'm Alex Jones from
[10:06.000 --> 10:12.240]  Austin Texas we're doing a story on the detention center and they would start
[10:12.240 --> 10:19.280]  talking and and saying yes they all stay here there is a old Serb man who only
[10:19.280 --> 10:25.320]  goes by Chattar he is the father of Mr. Hilton we don't know why their two
[10:25.320 --> 10:29.200]  names are different I said who else is with them and they said Germans they
[10:29.200 --> 10:34.120]  said Eastern Europeans they said Brett and I said how many and just hundreds
[10:34.120 --> 10:38.480]  and hundreds of paramilitary soldiers they're very secretive they tend to pay
[10:38.480 --> 10:44.480]  with cash and won't even tell people their last names so I figured if they
[10:44.480 --> 10:46.920]  were trying to get control of this facility the last year they would have
[10:46.920 --> 10:52.720]  been staying in hotels in downtown right off the facility we were correct we know
[10:52.720 --> 10:57.880]  we're gonna get turned around at the door at the local city and county seat
[10:57.880 --> 11:01.480]  we're still gonna go there we're gonna go talk to this spokeswoman who worked
[11:01.480 --> 11:04.720]  for the building this goes out for 19 years it's suddenly been hired by
[11:04.720 --> 11:08.280]  American police force a lot of people had pointed out the doublehead eagle is
[11:08.280 --> 11:14.200]  the Serb symbol we also knew it was the Illuminati symbol and also the Russian
[11:14.200 --> 11:18.920]  Republic symbol but we confirmed that it is the Serb code of arms they're using
[11:18.920 --> 11:22.560]  it because this is Serb a run Paul Watson has done some detective work
[11:22.560 --> 11:26.560]  confirming what other researchers have said in the last few days this is
[11:26.560 --> 11:29.440]  connected to black water and other shadowy groups it appears this is a
[11:29.440 --> 11:33.560]  cutout or a smoke screen or a front group for a larger organization we've
[11:33.560 --> 11:40.320]  confirmed Homeland Security has been in town black SUVs black Humvees bizarre
[11:40.320 --> 11:45.280]  military drills in people's on people's property black Hawk helicopters we talked
[11:45.280 --> 11:49.800]  to locals that said yeah I'll be out picking flowers in the field thanks that's
[11:49.800 --> 11:54.280]  the locals do around here in a helicopter will come hover right over them one
[11:54.280 --> 11:57.320]  person was said that they were out hunting dinosaur bones there's a lot of
[11:57.320 --> 12:01.320]  those dinosaur fossils and then a black Hawk helicopter came and hovered right
[12:01.320 --> 12:06.040]  over them and basically ran them off so this whole place is just crawling with
[12:06.040 --> 12:12.320]  spokes this is a major test operation and we have confirmed what what Michael
[12:12.320 --> 12:16.240]  Hollingsworth was saying yesterday on the show that American police force is
[12:16.240 --> 12:21.280]  trying to set up facilities in multiple states including California Texas
[12:21.280 --> 12:27.520]  Michigan and other areas so we've confirmed that a Homeland Security is
[12:27.520 --> 12:32.080]  looking at this site for FEMA Center that be shadowy merc groups have run
[12:32.080 --> 12:35.240]  what are known as black sites but not just black sites go sites the black
[12:35.240 --> 12:41.080]  sites it's a secret plan this time site a a a a go site is a black site where
[12:41.080 --> 12:46.880]  they hold detainees there is a 98% probability in my estimation that this
[12:46.880 --> 12:52.240]  is a go site being prepared but because they've been so secretive and so bizarre
[12:52.240 --> 12:56.840]  because the CIA and others have used this cutout group they always use former
[12:56.840 --> 13:02.000]  criminals they always use hardcore mercs this fits every MO every checklist we
[13:02.000 --> 13:06.480]  have absolutely hit the motherload here this is a confirmed FEMA camp being
[13:06.480 --> 13:10.680]  set up in heart Montana they admit they assessed it and chose it because the
[13:10.680 --> 13:14.920]  economy is collapsing one of the poorest communities in the United States here
[13:14.920 --> 13:19.000]  I'm looking at poor native Indians wandering the Native Americans wandering
[13:19.000 --> 13:22.560]  around the streets I'm looking at bag ladies I'm also looking at cowboys
[13:22.560 --> 13:26.280]  people coming in the grocery stores right now I am here just you're
[13:26.280 --> 13:31.800]  witnessing a really depressed economy in Montana hard Montana that is being
[13:31.800 --> 13:38.360]  taken over Captain Michael Hilton is a Serb national Greg Smith is the former
[13:38.360 --> 13:42.160]  head to Rivers who was removed for some reason now his wife Kerry Smith is
[13:42.160 --> 13:45.320]  running for mayor and looks like she's gonna win right now so they're really
[13:45.320 --> 13:49.280]  taking over the town they've also made statements to the news media and others
[13:49.280 --> 13:52.880]  that we don't care what the town wants or what people say now we've got the
[13:52.880 --> 13:57.160]  least this is it it's ours we pay two and a half million dollars the 27
[13:57.160 --> 14:02.360]  million dollar facility paid for by the taxpayers of the county born that we're
[14:02.360 --> 14:07.960]  in we're gonna talk to the big foreign sheriff's department about this as well
[14:07.960 --> 14:12.680]  the acting director is also the school board superintendent Al Peterson he's
[14:12.680 --> 14:16.960]  the acting director of the two Rivers authority so you just got the classic
[14:16.960 --> 14:19.640]  authorities like a third world country just coming in taking over the town
[14:19.640 --> 14:22.880]  taking over the county they won't say where the money's coming from they
[14:22.880 --> 14:30.560]  won't say why suddenly black SUVs black Mercedes SUVs showed up with the Serb
[14:30.560 --> 14:35.440]  insignia of the double-headed eagle beside it hardened police we're gonna go
[14:35.440 --> 14:39.760]  talk to locals about them pulling people over it was sleeting and raining last
[14:39.760 --> 14:46.680]  night at 1030 when we arrived at flying in on a turboprop aircraft landing on
[14:46.680 --> 14:50.280]  the Mesa top where they had the billing airport we drove out here through
[14:50.280 --> 14:53.600]  Custard of the town of Custard does where the battle of the little big
[14:53.600 --> 14:57.760]  war happened came into the town last night and it was raining so hard we
[14:57.760 --> 15:01.880]  should have stopped and done it but it appeared you know here well I looked at
[15:01.880 --> 15:05.280]  the crest that it said hardened police there is no hard police and they had
[15:05.280 --> 15:11.000]  someone pulled over less than 200 yards from the FEMA facility this is what
[15:11.000 --> 15:13.320]  they do with these cutouts we should have stopped and gotten it it was
[15:13.320 --> 15:17.560]  leading so hard I just wanted to find the place where we were staying but I did
[15:17.560 --> 15:20.680]  see that it's an ardent police so I'm gonna go question people it looks like
[15:20.680 --> 15:23.920]  unless there's a new heart and police department they say doesn't exist but
[15:23.920 --> 15:27.680]  they may be running police operations here right now I just realized I'm
[15:27.680 --> 15:30.920]  kicking myself right now I'm at the finer place and come back I'm gonna look
[15:30.920 --> 15:35.760]  around for this police vehicle that I saw again it was just raining and
[15:35.760 --> 15:41.160]  sweating so hard and I was wearing just a regular shirt had to go get changed and
[15:41.160 --> 15:45.000]  come back by the time we did they were gone in the weather report it said it
[15:45.000 --> 15:50.600]  was gonna be 60 here it was about 35 and absolutely phone chilling with 40
[15:50.600 --> 15:55.320]  mile an hour winds when we were out here we almost ran into some elk driving so
[15:55.320 --> 15:58.640]  thanks for everybody's prayers we nearly missed elk jumping out in front of us on
[15:58.640 --> 16:03.320]  the little lonely road you may drive 10 miles before you see a house out here
[16:03.320 --> 16:06.640]  I think it's a town of hard and it's a pretty big size town there's some
[16:06.640 --> 16:12.520]  mining operations going on here in the town there's a granary running here in
[16:12.520 --> 16:17.400]  the town as we drove in at night with the smoke stacks running so just just
[16:17.400 --> 16:21.880]  very very surreal here in the town of hard but Jason Burma's you've heard my
[16:21.880 --> 16:24.760]  basic break down on this coming up in about two hours we'll give you a full
[16:24.760 --> 16:28.120]  report with Steve Quayle coming up in about an hour we're gonna have Michael
[16:28.120 --> 16:31.720]  Hollings where I found to be absolutely dead on with his analysis we'll hook up
[16:31.720 --> 16:35.800]  with him later today but Jason Burma give me your take on what you've heard me
[16:35.800 --> 16:40.240]  break down here well I think it's just unbelievable this is the top story over
[16:40.240 --> 16:45.080]  at prisonplanet.com right now exposed American police force is a black water
[16:45.080 --> 16:49.720]  front group APF scrambles to delete web page admitting it runs black water
[16:49.720 --> 16:54.480]  controlled US training center provided proving the two organizations are one
[16:54.480 --> 16:58.360]  in the same I never thought I would see the day Alex where they're not only
[16:58.360 --> 17:03.160]  setting up FEMA camps but they're doing so with a privatized military force as
[17:03.160 --> 17:09.080]  notorious as black water and just telling people it doesn't exist well
[17:09.080 --> 17:13.560]  absolutely and remember black water became black water worldwide three years
[17:13.560 --> 17:18.320]  ago then it became XC because their old name with the murder charges they had
[17:18.320 --> 17:22.160]  charges the rape charges against their own people and children coming out in
[17:22.160 --> 17:25.720]  federal court they moved offshore but they are opening a training center in
[17:25.720 --> 17:29.000]  third California they're opening others and remember we need watching to get on
[17:29.000 --> 17:34.440]  this I just remembered this they were hiring Eastern European serve Czech
[17:34.440 --> 17:39.040]  Republic Merz as their main force now and I remember them hiring Brazil
[17:39.040 --> 17:45.520]  Ian and Argentinian some of the penises old commandos got hired with entire
[17:45.520 --> 17:51.600]  squads in some cases up to brigade strength I remember that report a year
[17:51.600 --> 17:55.560]  ago we need to pull those up put that in so this is black waters classic MO they
[17:55.560 --> 17:59.840]  have a lot of subsidiary and remember ladies and gentlemen black waters now in
[17:59.840 --> 18:03.280]  federal court for murdering people that got in the way of their contract there's
[18:03.280 --> 18:06.720]  a lot of mercenary groups killing people in mass and even military
[18:06.720 --> 18:10.720]  investigators in Iraq I'm not trying to scare people but this I didn't think
[18:10.720 --> 18:13.480]  this was too dangerous of a mission now I'm gonna realize we're dealing with
[18:13.480 --> 18:17.800]  hardcore felons here in a black water cut out it appears this is very dangerous
[18:17.800 --> 18:21.720]  when everybody's prayers on this here we're about to go in and start asking
[18:21.720 --> 18:25.440]  questions and start going up and demanding to speak with some of these

[19:14.160 --> 19:18.960]  media will not pick up on it except for the locals you'll probably see this two
[19:18.960 --> 19:23.400]  weeks maybe a month down the line because of the coverage that info wars is

[24:14.960 --> 24:19.240]  confirmed privatized FEMA camp and again we always warned you they'd blow the
[24:19.240 --> 24:23.760]  economy out first there would be turmoil in the United States and then in the
[24:23.760 --> 24:27.280]  background they'd set up these nice little FEMA camps where you're going to
[24:27.280 --> 24:30.840]  be encouraged to go and yes they're going to take over the police force and by
[24:30.840 --> 24:34.120]  the way they're not going to be actual law enforcement they'll be former
[24:34.120 --> 24:38.680]  military intelligence and former analysts and by the way they won't be from
[24:38.680 --> 24:43.680]  this country and they'll be headed up by foreigners and people thought that this
[24:43.680 --> 24:48.080]  was so nightmarish so outlandish that it could never occur yet it's happening in
[24:48.080 --> 24:53.720]  this country today today it is a reality and we're going to read this out of the
[24:53.720 --> 24:57.560]  billings gazette.com more analysis over at prisonplan.com and infowars.com
[24:57.560 --> 25:03.800]  right now the headline is APF American police force head Hilton has history of
[25:03.800 --> 25:08.840]  legal trouble and that's putting it lightly that headline is about as soft
[25:08.840 --> 25:12.440]  ball as it gets when you start reading this article I'm just going to read you
[25:12.440 --> 25:16.840]  a few different subsections here public records from police and state and
[25:16.840 --> 25:21.640]  federal courts in California show that Michael Anthony Hilton using that name
[25:21.640 --> 25:26.440]  and more than a dozen aliases over several years forget about three or
[25:26.440 --> 25:32.440]  four aliases try a dozen a dozen aliases over several years is cited in
[25:32.440 --> 25:38.960]  multiple criminal civil and bankruptcy cases and was sentenced in 1993 to two
[25:38.960 --> 25:44.400]  years in the state penitentiary of California and if you if you got
[25:44.400 --> 25:48.880]  convicted and brought up on dozens of charges think about what he's gotten away
[25:48.880 --> 25:52.840]  with this is a hardened criminal folks and obviously a very connected hardened
[25:52.840 --> 25:56.960]  criminal or he wouldn't be in the position that he is today Hilton
[25:56.960 --> 26:03.160]  pleaded guilty in March of 93 to 14 separate felonies including 10 counts of
[26:03.160 --> 26:08.240]  grand theft one count of attempted grand theft and three counts of diversion of
[26:08.240 --> 26:12.400]  construction funds according to the Orange County court records he was
[26:12.400 --> 26:16.880]  sentenced to two years in prison but is unclear how much time he served you see
[26:16.880 --> 26:21.800]  when you know people there's some backdoor shenanigans that can get you
[26:21.800 --> 26:26.080]  out of screwing people out of money because obviously this guy works for
[26:26.080 --> 26:31.120]  the military industrial complex he wouldn't be heading up what seems to be
[26:31.120 --> 26:35.760]  a blackwater front in hardened Montana as we speak if he didn't have those type
[26:35.760 --> 26:39.680]  of connections court records in the case list the real name as Michael Hilton
[26:39.680 --> 26:44.840]  but they also include the analysis made the back Ilya Dakovic me the bag Ilya
[26:44.840 --> 26:51.040]  Dakovic and Michael Milo drag Hilton who specifically who speaks heavily
[26:51.040 --> 26:55.120]  accented English has told reporters that he is a naturalized u.s. citizen
[26:55.120 --> 27:00.000]  originally from Montenegro a country bordering Serbia and once part of the
[27:00.000 --> 27:04.760]  former Republic of Yugoslavia court documents in this case alleged that
[27:04.760 --> 27:08.960]  Hilton and other solicited investments of hundreds of thousands of dollars from
[27:08.960 --> 27:12.440]  the plaintiff for the creation of a collectible Super Bowl commemorative
[27:12.440 --> 27:17.720]  coin so this guy's a scam artist and a hardened criminal and again this is the
[27:17.720 --> 27:22.280]  Billings Gazette this is the local newspaper how much longer until the
[27:22.280 --> 27:28.640]  media begins to report on this where are you we are in a desperate situation for
[27:28.640 --> 27:34.280]  this to become exposed in a time of mandatory mandatory vaccinations across
[27:34.280 --> 27:37.480]  the country and they are mandatory folks we're gonna get to that in just a
[27:37.480 --> 27:42.720]  moment we're gonna go over Abilene Texas the school system wants all of their
[27:42.720 --> 27:46.920]  kindergartners to seventh graders to take the shot and now they're saying well
[27:46.920 --> 27:50.120]  there's a couple exceptions and maybe we'll let these kids back into school
[27:50.120 --> 27:53.000]  maybe you'll let them back into school maybe you shouldn't have tried to
[27:53.000 --> 27:58.160]  forcibly inoculate them and across the country workers are saying no I don't
[27:58.160 --> 28:01.080]  want to take this yes I work in a hospital but there's no reason that I
[28:01.080 --> 28:05.120]  should have to take this swine flu vaccine again it's not really swine
[28:05.120 --> 28:09.760]  flu it's three different types of flu you have the H1N1 which is the pigs the
[28:09.760 --> 28:13.840]  pig flu the virus then you have the H5N1 which is the bird flu which it's
[28:13.840 --> 28:17.440]  part of that as well and then you have the human flu virus that this is all
[28:17.440 --> 28:24.000]  mixed together and they're saying no no no and you're only seeing local stories
[28:24.000 --> 28:28.080]  about it because again Barack Obama gets up on the television and he says no
[28:28.080 --> 28:33.320]  we're not gonna do any mandatory vaccinations it is literally at a 1984
[28:33.320 --> 28:39.840]  it is Orwellian doublespeak they are doing it across the country and big ups
[28:39.840 --> 28:42.880]  to the people in Albany that are fighting this and saying no and trying to
[28:42.880 --> 28:48.440]  expose the fact that there is no need to take this vaccination meanwhile our
[28:48.440 --> 28:55.040]  country just tumbles into communism it's the 60th anniversary of Mao and of
[28:55.040 --> 28:58.680]  course they're having parades in China he's such a great leader but what really
[28:58.680 --> 29:03.440]  disturbs me is that the Empire State Building in New York City was lit up
[29:03.440 --> 29:07.480]  with Chinese colors does this tell you that we are moving towards a
[29:07.480 --> 29:13.200]  dictatorship towards globalization towards a quote-unquote one world order
[29:13.200 --> 29:17.200]  you know if you said this five years ago you're a conspiracy theorist if you say
[29:17.200 --> 29:21.280]  it now you can type it into Google you hit the news button and all of a sudden
[29:21.280 --> 29:24.840]  there are dozens of stories daily about how the G20 is ringing in a new world
[29:24.840 --> 29:29.480]  order or how Chavez wants to work with Barack Obama towards a new world order
[29:29.480 --> 29:34.400]  these are the headlines the mainstream media today we'll be back after this

[33:19.480 --> 33:25.800]  segment and we got into the H1N1 vaccine I want to read this story out of
[33:25.800 --> 33:31.920]  global security newswire federal court backs Pentagon anthrax vaccination
[33:31.920 --> 33:35.040]  program remember they tried to have mandatory vaccinations based on the
[33:35.040 --> 33:39.640]  anthrax attacks shortly after 9-11 so many people refused the police officers
[33:39.640 --> 33:44.120]  the firefighters the health workers said no I'm not taking this and they had to
[33:44.120 --> 33:49.480]  back off but they're now backing off now eight u.s. defense department personnel
[33:49.480 --> 33:52.640]  have lost another round in their legal fight against mandatory anthrax
[33:52.640 --> 33:57.080]  vaccinations the Associated Press reported yesterday the u.s. court of
[33:57.080 --> 34:01.160]  appeals in Washington declined to overturn a lower courts move to dismiss a
[34:01.160 --> 34:04.360]  lawsuit claiming that the Food and Drug Administration had wrongfully found
[34:04.360 --> 34:08.200]  that an existing vaccine would provide adequate protection from inhaled
[34:08.200 --> 34:13.560]  anthrax bacteria we are presented with a scientific judgment by the FDA to which
[34:13.560 --> 34:18.080]  we owe considerable deference the court said saying that the plaintiffs had
[34:18.080 --> 34:23.080]  failed to show that the vaccine was not effective you see how this works they're
[34:23.080 --> 34:27.520]  putting it on eight military personnel to prove that the vaccine doesn't work
[34:27.520 --> 34:32.120]  they're not putting it on behest of the FDA to prove that it does work they're
[34:32.120 --> 34:36.240]  saying prove it doesn't work and that's how we that's how things go along
[34:36.240 --> 34:41.600]  slowly incrementally and that's why we're going to have mandatory vaccinations
[34:41.600 --> 34:46.680]  within this week by the way this story came out I believe two days ago for the
[34:46.680 --> 34:51.800]  military regarding the swine flu let's read this one this is associated press
[34:51.800 --> 34:55.400]  u.s. military troops will begin getting required swine flu shots in the next
[34:55.400 --> 34:59.520]  week to ten days with active duty forces deploying to war zones and other
[34:59.520 --> 35:03.800]  critical areas going to the front of the vaccine line a top military commander
[35:03.800 --> 35:08.880]  said Tuesday Air Force General Gene Rurant also told the Associated Press
[35:08.880 --> 35:14.040]  that as many as 400 troops are ready to go to five regional headquarters across
[35:14.040 --> 35:17.640]  the country to assist federal health and emergency management officials if
[35:17.640 --> 35:25.480]  needed as the flu season heats up the Pentagon has bought 2.7 million 2.7
[35:25.480 --> 35:31.160]  million vaccines and 1.4 million of those will go to active duty military let's
[35:31.160 --> 35:37.880]  stop right there the United States population around 300 million 1.4
[35:37.880 --> 35:42.760]  million military personnel about to take the vaccine that's roughly one in
[35:42.760 --> 35:48.280]  every 275 people that does not include none military personnel that does not
[35:48.280 --> 35:53.000]  include the children now being vaccinated at their schools which are now
[35:53.000 --> 35:58.720]  makeshift mass vaccination centers where they also expect to get the parents
[35:58.720 --> 36:04.840]  the friends and the family of these students national guard troops on active
[36:04.840 --> 36:09.200]  duty are also required to receive the vaccine as our civilian defense
[36:09.200 --> 36:13.360]  department employees who are in critical jobs let me repeat that that's not just
[36:13.360 --> 36:18.920]  active army active Marines active Navy no the National Guard are going to be
[36:18.920 --> 36:23.760]  required to take this shot as well as well as Defense Department personnel as
[36:23.760 --> 36:27.720]  a result the military is expected to provide health officials with an early
[36:27.720 --> 36:31.600]  assessment of the vaccine oh yeah they're gonna give out an early assessment
[36:31.600 --> 36:35.920]  folks the media is doing everything they can to try to cover up the young girl
[36:35.920 --> 36:40.880]  who died of a Gardasil shot this week that young girl died two hours after
[36:40.880 --> 36:44.440]  taking the shot and you know what the headline is over in the UK over at the
[36:44.440 --> 36:48.040]  Guardian over at the Telegraph they're now trying to tell people that she
[36:48.040 --> 36:53.080]  magically died from a malignant tumor in her chest now even if it's true that she
[36:53.080 --> 36:57.080]  had a malignant tumor in her chest the chances of her dying from that tumor two
[36:57.080 --> 37:02.560]  hours after taking a Gardasil shot are beyond belief but that doesn't stop the
[37:02.560 --> 37:05.880]  hype in the United States first of all the United States barely reported on
[37:05.880 --> 37:11.160]  it you didn't see it on Fox News you didn't see it on MSNBC you did see it
[37:11.160 --> 37:15.720]  on the Guardian the Telegraph Sky News over in the UK you first saw it when
[37:15.720 --> 37:19.400]  US News and World Report did a hit piece saying oh no it couldn't be the shot and
[37:19.400 --> 37:23.440]  remember the Associated Press and routers prepared you I'm sorry Reuters
[37:23.440 --> 37:28.000]  prepared you for this by saying that the swine flu shot was going to be blamed
[37:28.000 --> 37:33.000]  on all sorts of abnormal deaths and conditions but it won't actually be the
[37:33.000 --> 37:39.480]  shot it will be overly paranoid people folks in 1976 when they did this to
[37:39.480 --> 37:45.000]  people what happened people died people got Gilliams Bear made them quadriplegics
[37:45.000 --> 37:50.480]  they lost muscle motion in their mouths permanent damage they were in leg braces
[37:50.480 --> 37:55.800]  the rest of their life they lost lawsuits but it doesn't matter that George
[37:55.800 --> 38:00.080]  Wallace in 60 minutes reported on it in 1979 we'll just repeat history it
[38:00.080 --> 38:03.480]  doesn't matter that Gerald Ford read the same script the Barack Obama and his
[38:03.480 --> 38:09.120]  administration is currently reading it still flies on it still moves forward
[38:09.120 --> 38:14.960]  it's just disgusting again military to get mandatory swine flu shots soon and
[38:14.960 --> 38:17.720]  they're not stopping at the swine flu they're gonna try to give them the
[38:17.720 --> 38:23.360]  anthrax shot as well and before we get into Albany and their courageous effort
[38:23.360 --> 38:26.880]  to stop the shot saying no we're not gonna take it we're health workers we
[38:26.880 --> 38:31.760]  know this isn't good fewer face lockout for failing to get vaccination this is
[38:31.760 --> 38:36.720]  out of reporter news dot com in Abilene, Texas as hours past Wednesday the
[38:36.720 --> 38:40.680]  number of kindergartners kindergartners these are five-year-old children their
[38:40.680 --> 38:45.560]  brains aren't even fully developed yet five-year-olds the number of kindergartners
[38:45.560 --> 38:50.000]  and seventh graders in Abilene independent school district and Wiley ISD
[38:50.000 --> 38:54.400]  still in need of mandatory vaccinations continue to dwindle see they're putting
[38:54.400 --> 38:58.600]  pressure on your kid doesn't have it yet he needs to have it he can't come back
[38:58.600 --> 39:02.800]  to school until he gets it consequently fewer students faced being turned away at
[39:02.800 --> 39:06.440]  school today for failing to meet new state vaccination guidelines for
[39:06.440 --> 39:13.320]  kindergarten and seventh graders they put the mandatory language in this article
[39:13.320 --> 39:17.720]  they openly admit that you're going to be turned away from your school if you
[39:17.720 --> 39:20.240]  don't take the shot right here but they're saying fewer and fewer of them
[39:20.240 --> 39:25.400]  being turned away because they're taking the shot the Texas Department of Health
[39:25.400 --> 39:29.600]  had set today as the deadline for students to be in compliance students in
[39:29.600 --> 39:33.000]  those grades could be allowed in classroom today however if they have
[39:33.000 --> 39:37.680]  received exemptions for medical religious and consensious reasons so in
[39:37.680 --> 39:40.680]  other words they're admitting that you really don't have to take the shot and
[39:40.680 --> 39:45.560]  the mandatory language is only there to spook you out and try to force you into
[39:45.560 --> 39:51.560]  taking this vaccination roughly 250 AISD students in those grades down for more
[39:51.560 --> 39:56.280]  than 400 on Friday see they spook P another 150 students out within a week
[39:56.280 --> 40:00.760]  by saying it's mandatory you need it you can't come back to school and 30 Wiley
[40:00.760 --> 40:05.880]  ISD students in the two grades down from 45 there's another 15 so 165 more
[40:05.880 --> 40:10.640]  children were forced to take the poison lack the appropriate vaccinations as of
[40:10.640 --> 40:14.160]  late Wednesday afternoon the students will not let me see let me repeat this
[40:14.160 --> 40:17.760]  the students will not be allowed back into school until their records are up to
[40:17.760 --> 40:22.600]  date said Charles Perkins AISD associate superintendent for support
[40:22.600 --> 40:26.960]  service Charles Perkins needs a few emails and phone calls folks he needs to
[40:26.960 --> 40:30.000]  be let know that we shouldn't be vaccinating the children against
[40:30.000 --> 40:34.880]  something as ridiculous as hyped up as non-lethal as the swine flu and I'm
[40:34.880 --> 40:39.480]  seeing more and more deaths but as every single time I believe a 14-year-old
[40:39.480 --> 40:43.080]  died of quote-unquote the swine flu and then you find out that this 14-year-old
[40:43.080 --> 40:48.360]  had chronic conditions throughout the past few months and years that's what
[40:48.360 --> 40:52.040]  always happens it always seems to have you know they have gout they have a
[40:52.040 --> 40:56.320]  chronic heart condition but what do they do the headline is death from swine
[40:56.320 --> 41:01.280]  flu death from swine flu that's the hype there the military industrial
[41:01.280 --> 41:06.160]  complex is making money hand over fist on this they're running a psychological
[41:06.160 --> 41:12.760]  operation on the entire populace as well as a eugenics operation talk about a
[41:12.760 --> 41:16.040]  killing two birds with one stone they're killing three birds with one stone
[41:16.040 --> 41:19.160]  with that one parents of students without proper immunizations in Abilene
[41:19.160 --> 41:23.760]  ISD and Wiley ISD will be called if the students arrive at school unattended
[41:23.760 --> 41:28.640]  Wiley superintendent Joey Light said students absent proper immunizations
[41:28.640 --> 41:32.240]  will be required to rate for their parents in the library in Abilene ISD
[41:32.240 --> 41:36.840]  Perkins said students likely will wait in the school clinic see they're gonna
[41:36.840 --> 41:40.440]  put him in a room they're gonna hype it up again they're gonna tell the parents
[41:40.440 --> 41:44.080]  how bad they are before the parents get there they're gonna say well I you know
[41:44.080 --> 41:47.360]  if your mom and dad would just wise up and you just took the shot you could go
[41:47.360 --> 41:52.320]  back to class Joey you go see your friends Jimmy you hear that Jennifer
[41:52.320 --> 41:57.240]  don't you want to eat lunch students will be allowed to make up missed
[41:57.240 --> 42:01.720]  assignments Abilene ISD and Wiley ISD light and Perkins said at this time AISD
[42:01.720 --> 42:06.240]  is considering this as an excused absence they will not be allowed or they
[42:06.240 --> 42:08.760]  will be allowed to make up their work if they have assignments they could
[42:08.760 --> 42:12.400]  certainly work on them at home if the individual case becomes extended
[42:12.400 --> 42:16.560]  campuses would handle this as they would any absence so in other words it won't
[42:16.560 --> 42:21.200]  be excused at some point one potential problem for students without required
[42:21.200 --> 42:25.320]  immunizations Perkins said is a Texas Education Agency prohibition against
[42:25.320 --> 42:29.400]  missing 10 school days during a semester and not receiving credit because of it
[42:29.400 --> 42:33.200]  so they're also saying look if you're gone more than 10 days there's a chance
[42:33.200 --> 42:38.320]  you're gonna have to repeat the grade take the shot you don't want to have to
[42:38.320 --> 42:43.120]  spend another year in first grade or kindergarten do you take the shot this is
[42:43.120 --> 42:47.560]  just disgusting and hopefully we'll be posting it info wars calm and prison
[42:47.560 --> 42:52.360]  planet dot TV shortly it goes on and on but if you think these mandatory
[42:52.360 --> 42:57.880]  vaccinations are a myth they're all over the local mainstream media and the
[42:57.880 --> 43:04.200]  national media seems to be silent on this Albany issue health workers to state
[43:04.200 --> 43:09.240]  stick it okay they're having rallies outside of the state capital in Albany
[43:09.240 --> 43:14.600]  formaldehyde mercury and squalene may like may sound like ingredients in some
[43:14.600 --> 43:18.680]  kind of toxic chemistry experiment but these are actually what can be found in
[43:18.680 --> 43:23.760]  the H1N1 flu vaccine which should be made available to the public next week
[43:23.760 --> 43:29.800]  this is off the Troy record calm folks again local mainstream media not
[43:29.800 --> 43:33.640]  afraid to report this because if you look at it there are dozens of people out
[43:33.640 --> 43:37.760]  there with signs that say stop selling the illusion of a pandemic no mandatory
[43:37.760 --> 43:43.120]  H1N1 flu vaccines and this is about as hardcore as it gets starting off with
[43:43.120 --> 43:47.600]  the three most poisonous items in the vaccine formaldehyde mercury and
[43:47.600 --> 43:52.440]  squalene it is partially because of the presence of those toxins that nearly
[43:52.440 --> 43:57.240]  500 people rallied in the capital Tuesday against the state Department of
[43:57.240 --> 44:01.800]  Health mandating that health care workers should be vaccinated for the
[44:01.800 --> 44:05.440]  swine flu by the end of November if they don't comply these medical
[44:05.440 --> 44:10.440]  professionals could lose their jobs I'm worried about what is the vaccination
[44:10.440 --> 44:13.720]  itself but I'm especially worried that my freedom of choice has been taken away
[44:13.720 --> 44:18.120]  from me said Andrea Schofield a nuclear medicine technologist who drove from
[44:18.120 --> 44:21.160]  Rochester to attend the protest and that's no short drive that's about four
[44:21.160 --> 44:26.280]  hours away we want a choice but still be able to keep our jobs Schofield said
[44:26.280 --> 44:29.680]  that she received a letter last week from the from Unity Hospital where she
[44:29.680 --> 44:34.000]  works which stated that all hospital employees this is Unity Hospital in
[44:34.000 --> 44:38.760]  Rochester folks had to get the shot or become unemployed but that's not a
[44:38.760 --> 44:43.400]  mandatory vaccination give me a break but in lieu of this she said educating
[44:43.400 --> 44:46.440]  the public and health care workers on preventing the flu would be a better
[44:46.440 --> 44:50.800]  course of action and a press conference Tuesday afternoon just an hour after the
[44:50.800 --> 44:54.080]  conclusion of the rally with the State Department of Health Commissioner Richard
[44:54.080 --> 44:58.480]  Danes explained that it was up to individual institutions on what would
[44:58.480 --> 45:01.720]  happen with individuals who refuse the shot in other words not saying you
[45:01.720 --> 45:05.960]  can't fire these people but giving a wink wink of course you're going to fire
[45:05.960 --> 45:09.880]  them if they don't take the shot this could lead to termination or
[45:09.880 --> 45:13.720]  suspension if they if the entire medical institution refused to give the
[45:13.720 --> 45:17.680]  vaccination the state and would do an investigation and determine a plan of
[45:17.680 --> 45:22.920]  correction usually about 30 to 50% of health care workers voluntarily get the
[45:22.920 --> 45:27.400]  normal seasonal flu vaccine so three to five out of ten and that's a hyped up
[45:27.400 --> 45:31.840]  number it's probably more like 10% to 30% one out of ten to three out of ten
[45:31.840 --> 45:36.320]  actually take the regular flu shot but they have to hype it up so I've had
[45:36.320 --> 45:39.800]  doctor the numbers and say oh well almost half of them already take the
[45:39.800 --> 45:44.480]  regular flu shot that has thyme aerosol on again we've shown you the scans they
[45:44.480 --> 45:47.560]  always try oh mercury free mercury free and remember they're trying to push this
[45:47.560 --> 45:51.600]  not only on your school children the kindergartners to seventh graders we just
[45:51.600 --> 45:57.600]  read about but pregnant women as well how disturbed are these people all right
[45:57.600 --> 46:01.960]  I said I jumped to calls let's take a couple right now before the break let's
[46:01.960 --> 46:07.800]  go to Mike in Connecticut I believe Mike you're online yeah how's it going Jason
[46:07.800 --> 46:13.320]  good yeah actually I talked to Alex a couple days ago and about the swine flu
[46:13.320 --> 46:18.040]  I live right next to a hospital you can't help center and I've seen and I have
[46:18.040 --> 46:22.440]  so many of you tons and tons of military vehicles coming down to Farmington a
[46:22.440 --> 46:27.200]  small suburban town and you can't please the parlor there has been training with
[46:27.200 --> 46:31.240]  the state police and betraying with the National Guard and they're trying to say
[46:31.240 --> 46:35.680]  oh no it's just for cautious in case people start freaking out they can't get
[46:35.680 --> 46:40.000]  the swine flu like you say give me a break this whole thing is nothing but so
[46:40.000 --> 46:43.560]  you're telling me and this is also happening in Farmington Connecticut that
[46:43.560 --> 46:47.840]  there are US military on the streets assisting the police under the gut guys
[46:47.840 --> 46:51.800]  that people are going to freak out during this pandemic and demand the
[46:51.800 --> 46:56.240]  swine flu shot it's not on the street right you've got health center and I
[46:56.240 --> 47:02.280]  think a lot of military vehicles down there and neighbors neighbors old people
[47:02.280 --> 47:08.520]  that live here in Chinook and blackhawk helicopters flying forward to Pinnacle
[47:08.520 --> 47:12.720]  Mountain and old Nike base they're redoing it to make it an active military
[47:12.720 --> 47:17.240]  base well we need we need people out in Farmington Connecticut to take video and
[47:17.240 --> 47:22.640]  photographs of this posted on YouTube and then email it to us at Rob D at
[47:22.640 --> 47:27.960]  infowars.com and articles at infowars.com so we can immediately post this
[47:27.960 --> 47:31.880]  because obviously this is going to be going on all around the country especially
[47:31.880 --> 47:35.920]  now that the vaccine is supposed to be readily available within the week I
[47:35.920 --> 47:40.760]  thank you for the call Mike let's jump to Rodney in Texas Rodney you're online
[47:40.760 --> 47:47.360]  hey Burmese thanks for taking my call I forgive me if I'm being redundant here but
[47:47.360 --> 47:52.840]  I had read a story a couple days ago out of Toronto the Lope and Mail about this
[47:52.840 --> 47:59.080]  big scientist up there who submitted a report saying that anybody who took this
[47:59.080 --> 48:05.440]  swine flu shot were two and a half times likely more likely to catch this
[48:05.440 --> 48:12.000]  swine flu and so a great portion of a lot of the provinces up in Canada are
[48:12.000 --> 48:18.840]  suspending making a mandatory for people to take the shot because of the
[48:18.840 --> 48:25.720]  controversy that has been stirred up by this report from this scientist from
[48:25.720 --> 48:31.520]  they said well I gotta tell you it's not a shock that you would be two and a half
[48:31.520 --> 48:35.160]  more times more likely to get the swine flu if you take the shot the male
[48:35.160 --> 48:39.760]  clinic did a study I believe it was about three to four months ago where they
[48:39.760 --> 48:43.800]  admitted if you took the regular seasonal flu shot that you were two to
[48:43.800 --> 48:47.480]  three times more likely to actually get the flu so why would you take these
[48:47.480 --> 48:51.600]  vaccinations if you're more likely to get sick from them it is unconscionable
[48:51.600 --> 48:55.440]  to me that the mainstream media will not pick this up in this country and they
[48:55.440 --> 48:59.000]  will continue to beat the drums that you need to take this shot and if you don't
[48:59.000 --> 49:03.000]  take this shot you're going to be susceptible to this super deadly virus
[49:03.000 --> 49:08.240]  people are dying all over from it Rodney and and and I agree with you our
[49:08.240 --> 49:13.200]  mainstream media have said nothing about what's going on up there and if
[49:13.200 --> 49:17.480]  you look at more than half of that two-thirds of that country that they're
[49:17.480 --> 49:22.440]  saying that they're not going to make people take this shot and and mainly
[49:22.440 --> 49:27.120]  because of this report they're trying to come up with some type of propaganda to
[49:27.120 --> 49:32.400]  try to counteract its report this is the scientist submitted but but uh it's
[49:32.400 --> 49:38.720]  got people up there in Canada absolutely scared not just the people but a lot of
[49:38.720 --> 49:44.240]  the authorities because the report is based on actual facts which is you
[49:44.240 --> 49:49.160]  know seems like all we do here at info wars and prison planet is report on the
[49:49.160 --> 49:53.560]  actual facts if we're talking about it it's somewhere buried in the mainstream
[49:53.560 --> 49:57.840]  consciousness it's being reported on by the local media the studies have been
[49:57.840 --> 50:01.360]  done it's unfortunate that the New York Times won't pick up on it that the
[50:01.360 --> 50:06.240]  Washington Post refuses to discuss it that it won't be on Fox News or MSNBC
[50:06.240 --> 50:10.800]  that CNN headline news won't touch it they'll just put Sanjay Gupta up there
[50:10.800 --> 50:18.280]  CFR member and Bilderberg attendee and almost a Obama administration appointee
[50:18.280 --> 50:22.280]  he he at the last minute didn't take the job I believe it was the surgeon
[50:22.280 --> 50:26.240]  generals position but he'll tell you all day you need to take this vaccine
[50:26.240 --> 50:29.880]  remember they were trying to hype up that we needed to take three vaccinations
[50:29.880 --> 50:33.320]  and then they kind of pulled back and said you know what one vaccination might
[50:33.320 --> 50:38.320]  just be enough we're gonna continue to take your calls oh mary larry chase

[56:26.920 --> 56:31.800]  up the use of three Mercedes SUVs the black SUVs Alex was just talking about

[1:00:56.160 --> 1:01:00.720]  Hilton's past this is the guy that is heading this up Michael Hilton although
[1:01:00.720 --> 1:01:04.800]  he seems to be from Serbia or right outside of Serbia and that is not his
[1:01:04.800 --> 1:01:09.920]  real name the documents speak for themselves is anyone has found public
[1:01:09.920 --> 1:01:14.720]  documents the documents are what they are she declined to comment on Hilton's
[1:01:14.720 --> 1:01:18.400]  military experience Al Peterson vice president of Hardin's two rivers
[1:01:18.400 --> 1:01:22.840]  authority which built the jail declined to comment on Hilton's legal troubles he
[1:01:22.840 --> 1:01:26.200]  refused to say if he knew about Hilton's past when the authority reached a ten
[1:01:26.200 --> 1:01:31.600]  year agreement a ten-year agreement with American police force last month the
[1:01:31.600 --> 1:01:35.720]  deal is worth more than 2.6 million dollars a year according to city leaders
[1:01:35.720 --> 1:01:40.120]  see this is their 27 million dollar deal it doesn't matter if felons are going
[1:01:40.120 --> 1:01:43.440]  to be running the state of Montana that's okay with them as long as they
[1:01:43.440 --> 1:01:46.520]  have a little money because they've blown out the economy we need the
[1:01:46.520 --> 1:01:52.320]  government's help Hilton is also pledged to build a 17 million dollar
[1:01:52.320 --> 1:01:56.360]  military and law enforcement training center and he's promised to dispatch
[1:01:56.360 --> 1:02:00.440]  security to patrol Hardin streets build an animal shelter and a homeless shelter
[1:02:00.440 --> 1:02:05.200]  and offer free health care to city residents out of the jails clinic those
[1:02:05.200 --> 1:02:08.280]  additional promises were not included in the jail agreement which remains in
[1:02:08.280 --> 1:02:12.520]  limbo because u.s. bank has so far declined to sign off on the contract the
[1:02:12.520 --> 1:02:17.120]  bank and its trustees is in the bonds used to fund the jail a u.s. bank
[1:02:17.120 --> 1:02:21.320]  spokesperson declined to comment but Peterson was adamant the deal would be
[1:02:21.320 --> 1:02:25.720]  approved it's a solid deal and that's all I'll say but a representative of the
[1:02:25.720 --> 1:02:30.720]  of the corrections advocacy group that has been critical of hardens jail and
[1:02:30.720 --> 1:02:35.200]  has investigated Hilton's past said city leaders dropped the ball you bet they
[1:02:35.200 --> 1:02:39.200]  dropped the ball I'm amazed that city officials didn't do basic research that
[1:02:39.200 --> 1:02:42.360]  would have raised significant questions about American private police force and
[1:02:42.360 --> 1:02:48.360]  mr. Hilton's background Hilton 55 uses the title captain when introducing
[1:02:48.360 --> 1:02:53.080]  himself and on his business cards but he acknowledged it is not a military rank
[1:02:53.080 --> 1:02:57.160]  remember this is the same guy that told you he was a loan officer a cook a
[1:02:57.160 --> 1:03:02.800]  restaurant owner a car salesman all being reported by the mainstream media
[1:03:02.800 --> 1:03:07.680]  right now he said he is a naturalized u.s. citizen and a native of Montenegro
[1:03:07.680 --> 1:03:12.440]  aliases for Hilton that appear in court documents include the the dock of itch
[1:03:12.440 --> 1:03:17.560]  the Michael Hamilton Michael dock of itch he uses a dock of itch quite a bit
[1:03:17.560 --> 1:03:20.680]  one attorney who dealt with Hilton in a fraud lawsuit referred to him as a
[1:03:20.680 --> 1:03:25.360]  chameleon and has a reputation for winning people over with his charm his
[1:03:25.360 --> 1:03:31.120]  criminal record goes back at least in 1988 we reported 1993 the Associated Press
[1:03:31.120 --> 1:03:36.240]  is digging up reports of 1988 when Hilton was arrested in Santa Ana
[1:03:36.240 --> 1:03:41.560]  California for writing bad checks beginning in 93 Hilton spent six years
[1:03:41.560 --> 1:03:46.040]  in prison in California on a dozen counts of grand theft and other charges

[1:09:44.400 --> 1:09:49.320]  secretary they totally deny it she's saying that it doesn't exist and there's
[1:09:49.320 --> 1:09:55.320]  no foreign troops or no black water there no police I call the mayor's number I
[1:09:55.320 --> 1:09:58.920]  get through to stuff one of his secretary she's saying you know it's all
[1:09:58.920 --> 1:10:02.840]  miscommunication I tell her flat out you know black water is responsible for
[1:10:02.840 --> 1:10:05.880]  killing children you know they're all over the world doing it why are you
[1:10:05.880 --> 1:10:09.600]  putting it there why aren't you telling people about this you know are you
[1:10:09.600 --> 1:10:14.360]  responsible for murder what's wrong with you and they're they're liars well
[1:10:14.360 --> 1:10:20.200]  they're absolutely liars in the of USA today is is showing a picture of the
[1:10:20.200 --> 1:10:25.040]  camp which is highly fortified you're looking at probably 10 to 15 foot
[1:10:25.040 --> 1:10:31.440]  fences with a barbed wire at the top let's read the headline out of USA today
[1:10:31.440 --> 1:10:36.240]  and I thank you for the call and the effort chase or um I'm sorry Philip what
[1:10:36.240 --> 1:10:40.240]  is the American police force and what is it doing in Montana a secret of
[1:10:40.240 --> 1:10:46.360]  California outfit known as APF is is taking over a two-year-old never used
[1:10:46.360 --> 1:10:50.840]  prison in hardened Montana that was briefly considered as a possible spot
[1:10:50.840 --> 1:10:55.160]  for Guantanamo prisoners folks they're not shutting down Gitmo those are the
[1:10:55.160 --> 1:10:58.720]  headlines this week it's just too difficult they're saying that they may
[1:10:58.720 --> 1:11:02.920]  relocate some of them here and that'll give them excuse for extensive military
[1:11:02.920 --> 1:11:07.760]  and paramilitary and merc groups to train there again they have to have a
[1:11:07.760 --> 1:11:12.880]  reason it's problem reaction solution oh we really want to shut down Guantanamo
[1:11:12.880 --> 1:11:16.000]  Bay but we have to put these prisoners somewhere why not bring them to a
[1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:22.400]  privatized military facility run by FEMA the story has many twists and turns
[1:11:22.400 --> 1:11:25.800]  we recommend you read the Billings Gazette article for a primer on the
[1:11:25.800 --> 1:11:31.120]  story KULR TV and Billings Montana the Missourian and Talking Points Memo are
[1:11:31.120 --> 1:11:35.080]  also on the case so this is linking to all the articles that we've been
[1:11:35.080 --> 1:11:40.040]  discussing here in the first hour of the Alex Jones show APF's website which has
[1:11:40.040 --> 1:11:44.200]  been periodically unavailable click here for a recent cache of their site
[1:11:44.200 --> 1:11:48.600]  again they're doing their best to try to disassociate themselves from Blackwater
[1:11:48.600 --> 1:11:54.320]  but if you go to prisonplanet.com right now the top story exposed AFP is a
[1:11:54.320 --> 1:11:59.040]  Blackwater front group AP or I'm sorry APF scrambles to delete web page
[1:11:59.040 --> 1:12:02.920]  admitting it runs Blackwater controlled US Training Center proving that the two
[1:12:02.920 --> 1:12:10.640]  organizations are one in the same this is just unbelievable the site says it
[1:12:10.640 --> 1:12:14.480]  leverages the talent and expertise of their extensive global network to
[1:12:14.480 --> 1:12:19.040]  provide local regional and national security solutions to the United
[1:12:19.040 --> 1:12:22.640]  States government and other clients who were in need of customized private
[1:12:22.640 --> 1:12:28.320]  investigative services now where we heard that local regional and national
[1:12:28.320 --> 1:12:33.200]  security solutions well we heard it when they were running up to NLE09 the big
[1:12:33.200 --> 1:12:38.040]  summer takeover drill that involve foreign countries privatized groups and
[1:12:38.040 --> 1:12:43.520]  got you ready for what's occurring right now in Hardin, Montana here's the
[1:12:43.520 --> 1:12:46.600]  website pitch whether you was suspicious about a cheating spouse or
[1:12:46.600 --> 1:12:51.880]  concerned about a personal threat APF's team will employ their experience to
[1:12:51.880 --> 1:12:56.880]  fulfill your domestic investigation needs in one odd twist Becky Shay a
[1:12:56.880 --> 1:13:00.760]  reporter for the Billings Gazette who was reported extensively on the Hardin
[1:13:00.760 --> 1:13:04.920]  prison quit her job and is now a spokeswoman for the group in Hardin
[1:13:04.920 --> 1:13:08.800]  except that she is now mainly has no comment when pressed about what is
[1:13:08.800 --> 1:13:14.480]  going on some other unusual wrinkles Mercedes SUVs belong to APF began
[1:13:14.480 --> 1:13:19.000]  showing up recently in a town with magnetic decals that say city of Hardin
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:23.560]  police department but later removed them because they're not police their
[1:13:23.560 --> 1:13:28.480]  private security forces Albert Peterson vice president of Hardin's tax
[1:13:28.480 --> 1:13:31.920]  supported economic development arm that built the prison two years ago says
[1:13:31.920 --> 1:13:36.320]  people will be shocked when they learn the high quality of the person who will
[1:13:36.320 --> 1:13:40.080]  be running the operation the Gazette reports I did my background checks I
[1:13:40.080 --> 1:13:45.160]  did my homework and they're legit but they won't reveal the name Peterson's
[1:13:45.160 --> 1:13:49.200]  APF hopes to begin filling the prisoner with inmates early next year but neither
[1:13:49.200 --> 1:13:54.240]  he nor APF will say where the prisoners are coming from the Gazette quotes local
[1:13:54.240 --> 1:13:58.800]  law officials are saying they have reason to believe that APF is a spin-off of a
[1:13:58.800 --> 1:14:04.920]  much larger security company that has con contracts around the world aka black
[1:14:04.920 --> 1:14:09.360]  water the story again up at prison planet over info wars we're the first to
[1:14:09.360 --> 1:14:14.640]  bring you the truth Montana rep Bob Ebinger has joined other lawmakers in
[1:14:14.640 --> 1:14:19.240]  seeking questions from Hardin officials about the unusual deal always when
[1:14:19.240 --> 1:14:23.080]  things are secretive you end up getting everybody on both the right and the left
[1:14:23.080 --> 1:14:29.960]  making suppositions about what's going on but KULR says APS founder Michael
[1:14:29.960 --> 1:14:34.360]  Hilden has an extensive criminal record and has spent six years in a California
[1:14:34.360 --> 1:14:40.440]  prison the Missilean says court records show he also has alias mid these are
[1:14:40.440 --> 1:14:45.240]  the same aliases we've been discussing all morning and they are making note
[1:14:45.240 --> 1:14:49.280]  for what it's worth the APF logo is almost identical to the symbol of the
[1:14:49.280 --> 1:14:55.160]  state flag of Serbia just incredible revelations brought to you first by
[1:14:55.160 --> 1:15:00.080]  info wars.com and Alex Jones and now USA Today the Associated Press the
[1:15:00.080 --> 1:15:04.200]  Boston Herald all picking up on this information alright let's go back to the
[1:15:04.200 --> 1:15:12.360]  phone line Shelly in Texas Shelly you're on the line yes Shelly we drop her Paul
[1:15:12.360 --> 1:15:22.080]  in Canada Paul you're online yes sir okay so I made a couple phone calls
[1:15:22.080 --> 1:15:26.280]  myself yesterday mm-hmm I called Blackwater directly or not Blackwater
[1:15:26.280 --> 1:15:30.680]  sorry American police force I called the number on their website and I asked
[1:15:30.680 --> 1:15:37.640]  them hmm do you guys offer services in Canada and he tells me no we do not we
[1:15:37.640 --> 1:15:43.400]  own we are starting out in Montana and we will be spreading out expanding
[1:15:43.400 --> 1:15:47.720]  throughout the state that's huge that is so huge so they admitted on the phone
[1:15:47.720 --> 1:15:52.280]  that the Blackwater operations are indeed starting in Montana so this is an
[1:15:52.280 --> 1:15:57.360]  extension of Blackwater confirmed but why would he be I mean why is he so free
[1:15:57.360 --> 1:16:00.360]  about this like I encourage other people to call up and out the same thing but I
[1:16:00.360 --> 1:16:03.120]  wanted to know if they're in Canada because obviously I mean that's where
[1:16:03.120 --> 1:16:08.580]  I'm from mm-hmm so I sort of left it at that and I said okay thank you and he's
[1:16:08.580 --> 1:16:14.880]  like uh-huh I'm probably gonna get gangsta now who knows so I made another
[1:16:14.880 --> 1:16:23.160]  call to the Montana State Militia mm-hmm and I asked him like they had any
[1:16:23.160 --> 1:16:27.240]  concerns and he basically the paraphrase and he's telling me oh it's no big deal
[1:16:27.240 --> 1:16:31.160]  you know everyone's bringing making a lot of hype about it he's like we once
[1:16:31.160 --> 1:16:34.400]  there they had three black Mercedes Benz they're staying out of bed and
[1:16:34.400 --> 1:16:38.600]  breakfast he's like people are making all this hype and he also said that
[1:16:38.600 --> 1:16:43.040]  California prisoners are gonna be transferred there this is unbelievable
[1:16:43.040 --> 1:16:47.560]  this is not hype first folks this is how they get you prepared it's called
[1:16:47.560 --> 1:16:53.400]  incrementalism they slowly but surely drag you by the leash of tyranny and
[1:16:53.400 --> 1:16:59.200]  let you know what's coming okay they had the prison it was built in 2007 they
[1:16:59.200 --> 1:17:03.040]  knew that they didn't have a real prison populace out in Montana they knew they
[1:17:03.040 --> 1:17:07.520]  would be shipping in criminals from across the world they knew it was going
[1:17:07.520 --> 1:17:11.600]  to be privatized they didn't know that the media was gonna be so Johnny on the
[1:17:11.600 --> 1:17:16.280]  spot of exposing this Hilton character as a multiple felon with multiple
[1:17:16.280 --> 1:17:23.320]  aliases as a con man as a foreigner who's running a merc operation in the
[1:17:23.320 --> 1:17:28.600]  United States of America on the co-tails of the biggest military presence in the
[1:17:28.600 --> 1:17:33.000]  United States ever in Pittsburgh where there were checkpoints and humbies and
[1:17:33.000 --> 1:17:37.960]  National Guard personnel everywhere you look in the downtown area after the
[1:17:37.960 --> 1:17:43.120]  riot cops went berserk firing rubber bullets and tear gas on innocent
[1:17:43.120 --> 1:17:47.440]  civilians I mean you look at that video from Friday that's posted over at
[1:17:47.440 --> 1:17:52.320]  info wars.com again there's less than 200 maybe tops 300 people most of them
[1:17:52.320 --> 1:17:57.080]  not even protesters being attacked by riot police and I will I read the
[1:17:57.080 --> 1:18:00.320]  comments on these things and they say there's no military there it doesn't
[1:18:00.320 --> 1:18:05.600]  matter if I zoom in on two men in full military uniform it doesn't matter if
[1:18:05.600 --> 1:18:10.320]  it's admitted that 2,500 National Guard were deployed there it just doesn't
[1:18:10.320 --> 1:18:15.000]  exist people want to wallow in their own willful ignorance it's disgusting we're

[1:24:22.880 --> 1:24:27.520]  should have been listening and it isn't just Obama it's the special interest
[1:24:27.520 --> 1:24:32.680]  behind him and now we're seeing that come to fruition in hardened Montana the
[1:24:32.680 --> 1:24:36.840]  caller just said he called Blackwater straight up and they said no we haven't
[1:24:36.840 --> 1:24:41.640]  launched anything in Canada yet we're starting in Montana in the United States
[1:24:41.640 --> 1:24:46.320]  it's the Alex Jones show I'm Jason Burma's sitting in Alex to report in less
[1:24:46.320 --> 1:24:52.280]  than 60 minutes on the ground it's just unbelievable that this is happening in
[1:24:52.280 --> 1:24:57.280]  our country today and most of the mainstream media doesn't want to touch
[1:24:57.280 --> 1:25:00.600]  it they don't want to talk about it because of you the listeners out there
[1:25:00.600 --> 1:25:05.440]  that are posting on forums that are emailing the mainstream media that are
[1:25:05.440 --> 1:25:10.960]  calling Blackwater USA today has picked up on the story Boston Harold has picked
[1:25:10.960 --> 1:25:16.560]  up on the story and in front of me to illustrate the point that this isn't
[1:25:16.560 --> 1:25:22.000]  just the Obama administration's plan this is the military industrial complexes
[1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:27.920]  plan this is the plan of the technopoly out there to further the control grid
[1:25:27.920 --> 1:25:32.280]  that we all are under at this point I want to read just part of this document
[1:25:32.280 --> 1:25:37.520]  from the Rand Corporation this is a research brief does the United States
[1:25:37.520 --> 1:25:43.040]  need a new police force for stability operations you see they don't like the
[1:25:43.040 --> 1:25:48.760]  police force out there that's here to serve and protect you no they want
[1:25:48.760 --> 1:25:55.600]  officials they want to fish owls you see they don't want a police force that's
[1:25:55.600 --> 1:26:02.480]  there to help citizens no they want a police force that's out there to
[1:26:02.480 --> 1:26:09.760]  persecute to go after us to not have a problem pulling the trigger putting us
[1:26:09.760 --> 1:26:14.280]  in a camp stability operations have become a prominent feature of the
[1:26:14.280 --> 1:26:18.760]  international landscape recent examples include us and you and operations in
[1:26:18.760 --> 1:26:24.920]  Kosovo Bosnia Haiti Afghanistan and Iraq and now they're trying to turn us into a
[1:26:24.920 --> 1:26:30.240]  second or third world nation did you hear what I just read us and you and
[1:26:30.240 --> 1:26:34.640]  which have been amalgamated into one as the United States heads up the UN
[1:26:34.640 --> 1:26:39.240]  Security Council this month and Barack Obama became the first sitting president
[1:26:39.240 --> 1:26:45.360]  to ever accept the very big conflict of interest position as the head of that
[1:26:45.360 --> 1:26:49.440]  council you don't think global governments here they're announcing it at
[1:26:49.440 --> 1:26:55.200]  the G20 the death of the dollar is here it's on the cover of the Washington post
[1:26:55.200 --> 1:27:01.880]  the SDR unit is readily being traded around the world what is it going to
[1:27:01.880 --> 1:27:08.880]  take to wake us up is this the final straw are you awake are you calling your
[1:27:08.880 --> 1:27:13.920]  neighbor right now are you telling them to tune in that's the question are you
[1:27:13.920 --> 1:27:19.240]  being vigilant because you can be vigilant if you want to be you can become a
[1:27:19.240 --> 1:27:27.120]  human being again you can be in support of humanity instead of enslavement you
[1:27:27.120 --> 1:27:32.880]  only empower these people when you become fearful of what they're doing when
[1:27:32.880 --> 1:27:37.440]  you refuse to stand up for your rights when you refuse to say it's not okay
[1:27:37.440 --> 1:27:42.840]  that black water is taking over a FEMA camp and that's what this is they built
[1:27:42.840 --> 1:27:47.320]  this prison in 2007 while the Bush administration was still in office
[1:27:47.320 --> 1:27:51.920]  knowing that these plans would further themselves that they would take one step
[1:27:51.920 --> 1:27:56.440]  here and another step there and all of a sudden you're in total tyranny as the
[1:27:56.440 --> 1:28:03.600]  economy collapses the population is more apt to succumb to these tyrants all
[1:28:03.600 --> 1:28:06.160]  right let's continue with your callers we got a loaded phone line and then we
[1:28:06.160 --> 1:28:10.800]  have Hollander coming up in the next segment let's go to Curtis in Missouri
[1:28:10.800 --> 1:28:19.280]  Curtis you're online yes sir Curtis you're with us the artist Drake in Kanye
[1:28:19.280 --> 1:28:24.960]  West and in one of the verses Kanye West says you think I would I ran the
[1:28:24.960 --> 1:28:29.840]  world like Michelle has now is this some kind of coincidence or does he know
[1:28:29.840 --> 1:28:34.040]  something you know I'm really not following Curtis I'm gonna jump I mean
[1:28:34.040 --> 1:28:37.880]  I'm not a big fan of Kanye West in the first place and I'm not sure that he's
[1:28:37.880 --> 1:28:41.920]  too politically relevant at this point he seems like a drunken moron that's
[1:28:41.920 --> 1:28:46.600]  getting a bunch of press for you know jumping Taylor Swift at the music video
[1:28:46.600 --> 1:28:50.200]  awards I mean look at his haircut can you take that guy seriously I'm gonna go
[1:28:50.200 --> 1:28:56.480]  with no you can't leaf in Montana leaf you're on the line how you do it good I
[1:28:56.480 --> 1:29:01.960]  just wanted to bring up some clarity on some issues we have a member of the
[1:29:01.960 --> 1:29:08.800]  Crow tribe from Crow agency there that has been appointed to the deputy
[1:29:08.800 --> 1:29:14.360]  assistant to the Bureau Bureau of Indian Affairs mm-hmm Obama has had a an
[1:29:14.360 --> 1:29:18.800]  interest in native issues mm-hmm tribal land is sovereign ground and it makes it
[1:29:18.800 --> 1:29:22.360]  very attractive for people like his block water to build your facilities
[1:29:22.360 --> 1:29:26.800]  there because they're not bound by laws like Montana can't say no you can't
[1:29:26.800 --> 1:29:31.560]  build this well that's a great point and again we saw the integration of not
[1:29:31.560 --> 1:29:37.240]  only regional but tribal governments in NLE09 prepping the public and again now
[1:29:37.240 --> 1:29:41.280]  it's coming into fruition in hardened Montana will be back after this it's the

[1:34:19.320 --> 1:34:24.120]  that's about as far as i want to go with absolutely we completely understand so
[1:34:24.120 --> 1:34:27.440]  how did you come across this information i i mean was there a buzz
[1:34:27.440 --> 1:34:31.480]  around town did you just start seeing the sqv's did you see these people acting
[1:34:31.480 --> 1:34:36.600]  as police officers how do you become aware of this well it's actually what
[1:34:36.600 --> 1:34:40.480]  it boils down to is i as i mentioned yesterday on the show with alex i by
[1:34:40.480 --> 1:34:43.960]  operate a patriotically based website that is experienced an overnight surge
[1:34:43.960 --> 1:34:48.200]  and membership and you know i've been american patriotism is no stranger to my
[1:34:48.200 --> 1:34:52.560]  family this is something that we've done as as you know for our entire existence
[1:34:52.560 --> 1:34:55.920]  we've always been american patriots and we watch these things very carefully
[1:34:55.920 --> 1:34:58.880]  because with the current presidential administration usurping the
[1:34:58.880 --> 1:35:02.800]  constitution at every turn creating stars to bypass our system of checks
[1:35:02.800 --> 1:35:06.680]  balances completely ignoring the will and the voice of the american people you
[1:35:06.680 --> 1:35:11.520]  know it's just so painfully obvious to us that that at every turn that the voice
[1:35:11.520 --> 1:35:15.640]  of the american people is no longer being heard this is evidenced by the tea
[1:35:15.640 --> 1:35:19.560]  parties by the town hall meetings and everyone's criticism that the mass
[1:35:19.560 --> 1:35:22.440]  media's criticism of these events when american citizens are standing up and
[1:35:22.440 --> 1:35:26.360]  literally screaming in the middle of these events is the only way we can be
[1:35:26.360 --> 1:35:29.800]  heard you know we have a senator from south carolina in the middle of a
[1:35:29.800 --> 1:35:34.880]  presidential address that you're a liar to the president right out on on global
[1:35:34.880 --> 1:35:38.680]  television you know and with that being said you know it's it's coming to the
[1:35:38.680 --> 1:35:42.960]  point now where their game is being detected by far too many people american
[1:35:42.960 --> 1:35:49.000]  patriots are waking up at a phenomenal pace you know they're coming to grips
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:53.640]  with the fact that what's going on is not kosher it's not what it's what it's
[1:35:53.640 --> 1:35:57.000]  been represented to us you know when our president during his campaign said I'm
[1:35:57.000 --> 1:36:00.400]  gonna bring you change well yeah he brought us change he also said that we
[1:36:00.400 --> 1:36:04.120]  needed an american the national police force that was equally as strong and
[1:36:04.120 --> 1:36:08.440]  equally as well equipped and trained as our current military well we're seeing
[1:36:08.440 --> 1:36:11.880]  it in the form of this this american police force thing and then now over
[1:36:11.880 --> 1:36:17.160]  night now that this has gotten so much notoriety and so much media coverage
[1:36:17.160 --> 1:36:21.560]  they're discovering that this michael hilton guy who is the the headpiece of
[1:36:21.560 --> 1:36:26.640]  this american police force is actually one point one million dollars a debt and
[1:36:26.640 --> 1:36:31.680]  there's a a barrage of california lawyers now that are hunting him down he
[1:36:31.680 --> 1:36:36.840]  has three aliases docovich is the last name for three of them they're finding
[1:36:36.840 --> 1:36:40.440]  out that he's been a 14-time convicted felon in the state of california and
[1:36:40.440 --> 1:36:44.160]  they know all these guys like a peterson al peterson with the two rivers
[1:36:44.160 --> 1:36:46.880]  authority and he tells the media oh we've done our background checks and we
[1:36:46.880 --> 1:36:50.360]  know who the guy is we feel comfortable about him back to chase it to the world
[1:36:50.360 --> 1:36:53.840]  that we know that's his private business well no it's really not it's really not
[1:36:53.840 --> 1:36:58.560]  his private business when you're handing 27 handling 27 million dollars worth of
[1:36:58.560 --> 1:37:02.680]  a bond referendum of taxpayer money that these people sank their last hope into
[1:37:02.680 --> 1:37:06.680]  thinking that this jail was going to be you know the end of their financial
[1:37:06.680 --> 1:37:11.040]  problems and you're handing it to some guy who has a documented criminal did
[1:37:11.040 --> 1:37:14.720]  anybody run a background check on this guy legally he's not even allowed to be
[1:37:14.720 --> 1:37:17.760]  around firearms how can you be involved in law enforcement if you can't be around
[1:37:17.760 --> 1:37:22.160]  firearms as a convicted felon a multitude of charges against this guy
[1:37:22.160 --> 1:37:26.080]  to let's make it clear these aren't like namby pamby slap on the wrist type
[1:37:26.080 --> 1:37:30.320]  charges you just discussed 1.1 million dollars well that was weighed against him
[1:37:30.320 --> 1:37:35.040]  in a civil case they're saying that this guy has posed as a car salesman as a
[1:37:35.040 --> 1:37:41.320]  restaurant owner as a arts dealer I mean every scam in the book he has collectibles
[1:37:41.320 --> 1:37:45.200]  yeah global collectibles he served apparently not two years in prison but
[1:37:45.200 --> 1:37:50.040]  six years in prison according to the Associated Press in this latest Boston
[1:37:50.040 --> 1:37:54.800]  Herald article that is really just come into development in the last hour or so
[1:37:54.800 --> 1:38:01.560]  USA Today is now picking up on the story but he's got over a dozen aliases 14
[1:38:01.560 --> 1:38:05.960]  felonies including 10 counts of grand theft this isn't you and I saying that
[1:38:05.960 --> 1:38:11.480]  this is the actual billings gazette that used to employ this becky shay character
[1:38:11.480 --> 1:38:15.320]  correct and you know here's the scary thing and I'm gonna step out on a limb
[1:38:15.320 --> 1:38:18.840]  at the risk of making a semi-accusatory statement and I'm gonna suggest that
[1:38:18.840 --> 1:38:22.320]  anybody with an IQ equivalent to a bowl of fruit salad can see that the
[1:38:22.320 --> 1:38:26.480]  conspiracy and the corruption involved in this
[1:38:26.480 --> 1:38:29.600]  is a heck of a lot higher than only the hardened city council into reverse
[1:38:29.600 --> 1:38:32.480]  authority several people must have been paid off
[1:38:32.480 --> 1:38:36.400]  you know you cannot build a twenty seven million dollar facility
[1:38:36.400 --> 1:38:38.920]  without knowing that it's not going to match code
[1:38:38.920 --> 1:38:41.680]  you know Montana state law was very clear about the square footage
[1:38:41.680 --> 1:38:44.960]  requirements to be able to capture a prisoner so my question becomes this
[1:38:44.960 --> 1:38:48.760]  and this is the question that I pose to every listener out there right now
[1:38:48.760 --> 1:38:50.040]  it's very simple
[1:38:50.040 --> 1:38:52.400]  how far back to this plan go
[1:38:52.400 --> 1:38:55.160]  and how many people are truly involved in it
[1:38:55.160 --> 1:38:57.880]  you know where did where's the money that that's what we need to do now
[1:38:57.880 --> 1:39:00.640]  these guys have sacrificed their their mouthpiece
[1:39:00.640 --> 1:39:03.920]  if they threw Becky Shay and they threw Michael held not to the wolves
[1:39:03.920 --> 1:39:06.880]  because they knew those two would be torn to pieces just like they have over
[1:39:06.880 --> 1:39:09.640]  the last forty hours they got shredded
[1:39:09.640 --> 1:39:11.280]  that's all the way that's it
[1:39:11.280 --> 1:39:14.440]  it's not something that they wanted to find out just how many people were
[1:39:14.440 --> 1:39:15.720]  paying attention
[1:39:15.720 --> 1:39:18.640]  and exactly what the response would be now what we need to do and i've got
[1:39:18.640 --> 1:39:22.080]  breaking news that's coming out on this i'm gonna tell you guys something
[1:39:22.080 --> 1:39:24.840]  uh... essentially personal risk here
[1:39:24.840 --> 1:39:27.920]  i had a committee last night working in conjunction with the montana state
[1:39:27.920 --> 1:39:31.200]  senator who at this point in time is going to remain unnamed
[1:39:31.200 --> 1:39:32.720]  we actually cracked
[1:39:32.720 --> 1:39:34.760]  american police forces website
[1:39:34.760 --> 1:39:36.080]  and bypassed
[1:39:36.080 --> 1:39:38.720]  some of their security protocols and found out that they have a direct
[1:39:38.720 --> 1:39:39.920]  connection
[1:39:39.920 --> 1:39:43.360]  to i want to say it's called the people who find that again in my emails here
[1:39:43.360 --> 1:39:45.200]  have been sending these things all night
[1:39:45.200 --> 1:39:48.840]  uh... dpnsa i think it is is the link
[1:39:48.840 --> 1:39:54.920]  i believe it is dpnsa dot com slash about us dot htm i have it in front of
[1:39:54.920 --> 1:39:58.040]  them okay that's the one that most people's computers are not going to be
[1:39:58.040 --> 1:40:00.720]  able to get past their moderators set
[1:40:00.720 --> 1:40:03.720]  security protocol that means that someone is deliberately blocking that
[1:40:03.720 --> 1:40:08.240]  site one of our guys was able to bypass that and we took screen captures
[1:40:08.240 --> 1:40:12.200]  of their website improving that and the logos are exactly the same
[1:40:12.200 --> 1:40:15.000]  that's what we were we spent all night last night i had a committee of twenty
[1:40:15.000 --> 1:40:19.240]  two people working all night long last night desperately
[1:40:19.240 --> 1:40:22.880]  trying to find the connection between american police force and private
[1:40:22.880 --> 1:40:26.080]  military company and by god we found it we got it
[1:40:26.080 --> 1:40:29.080]  the logo is exactly the same the layout of the page is the same
[1:40:29.080 --> 1:40:31.760]  the picture formats are the same that things i want to draw people's attention
[1:40:31.760 --> 1:40:33.000]  to very clearly
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:35.080]  is that if you look at these images
[1:40:35.080 --> 1:40:39.280]  these are foreign troops carrying foreign weapons to determine their htg
[1:40:39.280 --> 1:40:42.120]  thirty six is mp5 submachine guns
[1:40:42.120 --> 1:40:44.680]  uh... you'll see american blackhawks but we've sold those helicopters to
[1:40:44.680 --> 1:40:45.520]  everybody
[1:40:45.520 --> 1:40:49.800]  you'll also see that serbian royal family crest popping up all over the place
[1:40:49.800 --> 1:40:52.760]  now it's not been too long in our history that we were dealing with serbs and
[1:40:52.760 --> 1:40:53.840]  croats
[1:40:53.840 --> 1:40:55.680]  uh... overseas
[1:40:55.680 --> 1:40:57.080]  that being said
[1:40:57.080 --> 1:41:00.320]  this is where the investigation needs to go this is where the american people
[1:41:00.320 --> 1:41:01.760]  need to get on their phones
[1:41:01.760 --> 1:41:04.600]  contact their elected officials and demand
[1:41:04.600 --> 1:41:07.120]  really put the free free of information act
[1:41:07.120 --> 1:41:10.640]  and other various types of uh... of political activity groups like that
[1:41:10.640 --> 1:41:12.520]  you know there are right that we are
[1:41:12.520 --> 1:41:15.480]  but they come and these people to release their information
[1:41:15.480 --> 1:41:18.560]  were they functioning in montana with a business like so we don't know that
[1:41:18.560 --> 1:41:21.360]  in order to function as an investigative entity you have to be
[1:41:21.360 --> 1:41:24.520]  licensed to two montana state boards
[1:41:24.520 --> 1:41:27.240]  so in order to you know where you have all these associations with all these
[1:41:27.240 --> 1:41:31.480]  weapons everything you have to have the a tfp uh... class three permits
[1:41:31.480 --> 1:41:34.400]  uh... for for dealership even then you know that in order to get those kinds of
[1:41:34.400 --> 1:41:36.120]  gun dealer license and everything
[1:41:36.120 --> 1:41:39.480]  what you know what this is what guys this is what we need to be focusing on
[1:41:39.480 --> 1:41:42.640]  this is this is tyranny at its finest
[1:41:42.640 --> 1:41:45.560]  this is called unconventional worker they are playing us
[1:41:45.560 --> 1:41:47.000]  like a cheap fiddle
[1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:48.480]  you know uh...
[1:41:48.480 --> 1:41:52.920]  district chief executive officer for blackwater security former navy seal
[1:41:52.920 --> 1:41:55.320]  uh... his name escapes me right at the moment i've kind of wound up at the
[1:41:55.320 --> 1:41:58.080]  moment but a really long night eric prince
[1:41:58.080 --> 1:42:02.080]  was quoted as having said quoted as having said to a senate subcommittee
[1:42:02.080 --> 1:42:03.360]  we can land
[1:42:03.360 --> 1:42:06.920]  a battalion size element of special forces qualified soldiers on the ground
[1:42:06.920 --> 1:42:09.600]  anywhere in the globe in less than seventy two hours now my the only one
[1:42:09.600 --> 1:42:12.080]  that finds it wildly ironic
[1:42:12.080 --> 1:42:14.520]  that american police forces the same thing
[1:42:14.520 --> 1:42:17.840]  there's lots of similarities that are like verbatim now that u.s. training
[1:42:17.840 --> 1:42:20.640]  center this is something else i put out in the the email that's going out to
[1:42:20.640 --> 1:42:21.640]  everybody
[1:42:21.640 --> 1:42:25.280]  is that u.s. training center is capitalized as a proper now and that
[1:42:25.280 --> 1:42:28.760]  means that it is the name of a facility
[1:42:28.760 --> 1:42:30.120]  it's a specific name
[1:42:30.120 --> 1:42:32.600]  which means that and you and blackwater xc
[1:42:32.600 --> 1:42:34.300]  was the one that had
[1:42:34.300 --> 1:42:37.400]  their facility dubbed as the u.s. training center so there's a connection
[1:42:37.400 --> 1:42:39.720]  although albeit uh... uh... and not
[1:42:39.720 --> 1:42:43.640]  absolutely rock solid one it's still enough to draw speculation it's still
[1:42:43.640 --> 1:42:45.160]  enough to bring it up on the carpet
[1:42:45.160 --> 1:42:49.320]  we just had a caller call in from canada who called up blackwater asking if
[1:42:49.320 --> 1:42:52.480]  they had any operations going on in canada and the man from blackwater
[1:42:52.480 --> 1:42:56.120]  said no we're starting our operations in montana
[1:42:56.120 --> 1:42:58.400]  another huge red flag and again
[1:42:58.400 --> 1:43:03.120]  up at prison planet dot com right now exposed american police force is a
[1:43:03.120 --> 1:43:07.400]  blackwater font front group apf scrambles to delete web page admitting it
[1:43:07.400 --> 1:43:10.720]  runs blackwater controlled u.s. training center proving that the two
[1:43:10.720 --> 1:43:14.000]  organizations are one and the same and this is up
[1:43:14.000 --> 1:43:18.640]  right now at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com just simply amazing
[1:43:18.640 --> 1:43:21.440]  absolutely they're not good they're on the run buddy we got them
[1:43:21.440 --> 1:43:24.280]  the one thing that they did is they underestimated the american patriot and
[1:43:24.280 --> 1:43:25.240]  they didn't think
[1:43:25.240 --> 1:43:27.680]  you know this is the information age they didn't think that there was many
[1:43:27.680 --> 1:43:29.320]  people out here veterans
[1:43:29.320 --> 1:43:32.360]  law enforcement veterans public service veterans concerned american citizens
[1:43:32.360 --> 1:43:34.600]  they thought we were just gonna sit back and take it
[1:43:34.600 --> 1:43:38.120]  and they're finding out just how dangerously wrong they are
[1:43:38.120 --> 1:43:40.760]  uh... we got that they can run all they want and they can pull their website
[1:43:40.760 --> 1:43:42.800]  all they want we got screen captures
[1:43:42.800 --> 1:43:43.920]  we got pictures
[1:43:43.920 --> 1:43:47.280]  and for anybody listening there are at least one hundred people
[1:43:47.280 --> 1:43:49.480]  who have copies of the screen captures
[1:43:49.480 --> 1:43:53.640]  so what do you want to take a take a second and direct the listeners energy
[1:43:53.640 --> 1:43:56.280]  and what they can do to help us
[1:43:56.280 --> 1:43:57.560]  battle this
[1:43:57.560 --> 1:44:03.280]  private military takeover of the united states town i cannot reiterate this
[1:44:03.280 --> 1:44:08.080]  enough they have put a convicted felon in charge according to the billings
[1:44:08.080 --> 1:44:13.480]  gazette and other mainstream outlets who uses over a dozen aliases and
[1:44:13.480 --> 1:44:19.680]  admittedly hails from a country just outside of syria if not syria itself
[1:44:19.680 --> 1:44:23.440]  uh... the recommendation is very clear very concise and very simple
[1:44:23.440 --> 1:44:26.560]  to all of you american patriots within the the boundaries of the sound of my
[1:44:26.560 --> 1:44:31.440]  voice do not initiate contact exercise as much diplomatic
[1:44:31.440 --> 1:44:32.400]  uh...
[1:44:32.400 --> 1:44:35.840]  uh... powers you can call your elected officials make sure that they're aware
[1:44:35.840 --> 1:44:38.760]  flood their phone lines flood their emails
[1:44:38.760 --> 1:44:41.400]  make sure that they are one hundred percent aware that you are intimately
[1:44:41.400 --> 1:44:43.160]  familiar with what's going on
[1:44:43.160 --> 1:44:45.560]  let them know that you are an american patriot
[1:44:45.560 --> 1:44:47.960]  that you believe in the constitution of the bill of rights
[1:44:47.960 --> 1:44:50.560]  that you believe in the system of checks and balances i mean this is
[1:44:50.560 --> 1:44:54.080]  ladies and gentlemen they can hear me right now this is our war
[1:44:54.080 --> 1:44:56.640]  for all those people out there who are cocked and locked and ready for the
[1:44:56.640 --> 1:44:59.480]  fight i'm here to tell you that is not the right approach at this particular
[1:44:59.480 --> 1:45:00.400]  moment in time
[1:45:00.400 --> 1:45:01.800]  if we do that
[1:45:01.800 --> 1:45:04.680]  that takes away every bit of credibility we have it takes away every bit of
[1:45:04.680 --> 1:45:07.960]  dignity we have and it makes them exactly what the left is trying to accuse us
[1:45:07.960 --> 1:45:08.880]  of being
[1:45:08.880 --> 1:45:11.480]  if we function with intelligence logic and reason
[1:45:11.480 --> 1:45:14.920]  you know right now is it was proven overnight that this works
[1:45:14.920 --> 1:45:18.400]  getting people together using their information get on the internet find the
[1:45:18.400 --> 1:45:22.440]  stuff you could you know all of the web pages google caches and stuff like that
[1:45:22.440 --> 1:45:23.840]  pick out key phrases
[1:45:23.840 --> 1:45:25.240]  google the heck out of
[1:45:25.240 --> 1:45:28.600]  guys find those links share them get involved in groups
[1:45:28.600 --> 1:45:31.720]  you know contact your local friends contact your family make sure that they are
[1:45:31.720 --> 1:45:33.200]  appraised of what's going on
[1:45:33.200 --> 1:45:35.760]  and even if they tell you i know you know what you're right wing extremist
[1:45:35.760 --> 1:45:37.880]  say no mom dad i'm really not
[1:45:37.880 --> 1:45:39.040]  and here's the proof
[1:45:39.040 --> 1:45:42.120]  don't listen to me just look at what i'm showing
[1:45:42.120 --> 1:45:44.880]  that's right here for your eyes to see people like alex jones of the
[1:45:44.880 --> 1:45:46.560]  phenomenal resource
[1:45:46.560 --> 1:45:50.080]  uh... i'm incredibly have proud that i've been given the opportunity to get
[1:45:50.080 --> 1:45:51.920]  this message out to the american people
[1:45:51.920 --> 1:45:54.880]  and i think alex and and the rest of the staff for it and you know you guys are
[1:45:54.880 --> 1:45:56.240]  doing a bang up job
[1:45:56.240 --> 1:45:58.520]  but just make sure that you don't give up
[1:45:58.520 --> 1:46:01.280]  okay ladies and gentlemen i'm here to tell you that their strategy is very
[1:46:01.280 --> 1:46:02.120]  simple
[1:46:02.120 --> 1:46:04.440]  they want to weaken you psychologically
[1:46:04.440 --> 1:46:07.440]  they want you to become so saturated with the stuff that you become and uh...
[1:46:07.440 --> 1:46:11.420]  just basically desensitized to it the same way they did with nine eleven
[1:46:11.420 --> 1:46:14.000]  you know anybody can look at the pentagon and realize that that was not a
[1:46:14.000 --> 1:46:17.480]  Boeing seven fifty seven but that's a whole nother ball of wax
[1:46:17.480 --> 1:46:19.480]  right now what we need to be concentrating on
[1:46:19.480 --> 1:46:22.040]  is making sure that these people are aware and you don't have to go out there
[1:46:22.040 --> 1:46:25.000]  armed you can put two hundred three hundred four hundred people on the city
[1:46:25.000 --> 1:46:28.440]  streets of harden and stand right in front of their business offices
[1:46:28.440 --> 1:46:31.000]  and demand that you to use a legal me
[1:46:31.000 --> 1:46:33.240]  this freedom of information act
[1:46:33.240 --> 1:46:35.920]  is that you can come and their information to come out but you flood
[1:46:35.920 --> 1:46:39.800]  brian schweitzer you flood john tester you flood max bachas all of their stuff
[1:46:39.800 --> 1:46:43.360]  is available online all their phone numbers are online if you can't find it
[1:46:43.360 --> 1:46:47.120]  uh... i'm sure alex has put up links to my website we will have within minutes
[1:46:47.120 --> 1:46:49.920]  we will have all of their emails and phone numbers up
[1:46:49.920 --> 1:46:52.520]  but right now we have to remember to maintain
[1:46:52.520 --> 1:46:56.080]  the moral high ground we have to maintain our dignified stance and that's
[1:46:56.080 --> 1:47:00.000]  absolutely critical and key element that i cannot focus on enough
[1:47:00.000 --> 1:47:03.240]  but you know i would also encourage everybody out there to
[1:47:03.240 --> 1:47:07.640]  armed themselves with the greatest weapon in the info war and that is a
[1:47:07.640 --> 1:47:13.280]  camcorder a small digital video camcorder can collect so much information
[1:47:13.280 --> 1:47:18.600]  and make people so aware of the real state of affairs going on right now
[1:47:18.600 --> 1:47:21.720]  in harden montana it's more than a news article
[1:47:21.720 --> 1:47:26.040]  it's more than us talking about on the radio when people can actually see
[1:47:26.040 --> 1:47:29.360]  the sites of u s
[1:47:29.360 --> 1:47:35.840]  cities being occupied by foreign mercs let me repeat that foreign mercs
[1:47:35.840 --> 1:47:39.680]  they better wake up i mean it is time to wake up they built this prison in two
[1:47:39.680 --> 1:47:44.360]  thousand and seven knowing damn well what it was being built for
[1:47:44.360 --> 1:47:47.720]  and you know this excuse that they might be bringing in get more prisoners
[1:47:47.720 --> 1:47:53.200]  here is just another excuse to run further military and paramilitary and
[1:47:53.200 --> 1:47:59.280]  mercenary operations onsite and act like it is necessary absolutely smoke and
[1:47:59.280 --> 1:48:03.360]  mirrors and they're kind of rolling this out right now as they're telling you
[1:48:03.360 --> 1:48:07.560]  that get more won't be closed down but maybe we can move some people into the
[1:48:07.560 --> 1:48:11.840]  united states this isn't going to close down guantanamo bay it is just going to
[1:48:11.840 --> 1:48:16.440]  further the police state agenda in this country
[1:48:16.440 --> 1:48:23.800]  exactly and i'm sure this is going to draw some flashback but i want people
[1:48:23.800 --> 1:48:27.360]  just to think about what i'm gonna say when a governmental administration
[1:48:27.360 --> 1:48:32.040]  takes a word like militia and starts to demonize it and synonymous it with
[1:48:32.040 --> 1:48:36.480]  things like white supremacist and hate group and hate crime and gave after all
[1:48:36.480 --> 1:48:39.920]  this other stuff people they're trying to focus your attention away from what
[1:48:39.920 --> 1:48:44.240]  they're really doing every able-bodied man between the age of sixteen and sixty
[1:48:44.240 --> 1:48:48.040]  five is considered a nation's militia and as our citizenry as the populace of
[1:48:48.040 --> 1:48:51.280]  this nation we are charged with its defense now that does not always mean
[1:48:51.280 --> 1:48:55.840]  taking up arms what that means is that we have to stand the watch diligently
[1:48:55.840 --> 1:49:00.320]  and vigilantly and we must preserve our way of life because every freedom that
[1:49:00.320 --> 1:49:05.200]  we do not actively fight for is when we voluntarily give away so don't be fooled
[1:49:05.200 --> 1:49:08.400]  and anytime they're attacking somebody in the media they go after you know
[1:49:08.400 --> 1:49:11.160]  especially like they go after Alex or somebody else and say oh he's a crazy
[1:49:11.160 --> 1:49:14.680]  the loony you know what that just means that you're on track if you're being
[1:49:14.680 --> 1:49:18.120]  called a conspiracy theorist if you're being called tinfoil hatter you might
[1:49:18.120 --> 1:49:21.000]  want to redouble your efforts and check it out because you might just be on to
[1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:23.400]  something you know i generally i'll be honest with you people and tell you that
[1:49:23.400 --> 1:49:26.360]  i generally don't subscribe to stuff like this and ordinarily a year ago i
[1:49:26.360 --> 1:49:29.960]  would have probably dismissed it but here lately after this new election
[1:49:29.960 --> 1:49:34.160]  ladies and gentlemen the time is now now is a time of networking it is a time of
[1:49:34.160 --> 1:49:38.960]  preparation it is a time of brotherhood and unification and an American
[1:49:38.960 --> 1:49:42.240]  patriotism we have to take this country back if we don't
[1:49:42.240 --> 1:49:43.840]  we're voluntarily giving it away
[1:49:43.840 --> 1:49:48.240]  it is astonishing how they have been able to roll out youth core
[1:49:48.240 --> 1:49:51.840]  they've been rolling out a carbon tax they've rolled out the death of the
[1:49:51.840 --> 1:49:57.440]  dollar they've rolled out more u n and global cooperation and now they are
[1:49:57.440 --> 1:50:03.040]  rolling out privatized military forces on the streets of the united states of
[1:50:03.040 --> 1:50:07.920]  america and they are not shy folks they are putting a hardened convicted
[1:50:07.920 --> 1:50:12.240]  criminal in charge and they're giving him a nice american name hilton
[1:50:12.240 --> 1:50:16.080]  oh he must be trustworthy and then you look at all these aliases
[1:50:16.080 --> 1:50:20.400]  and you look at how now the mainstream media in just a day in just a day
[1:50:20.400 --> 1:50:24.480]  is having to pick up on this story because of our great listeners our great
[1:50:24.480 --> 1:50:29.200]  viewers out there at info wars dot com and prison planet dot tv but just like
[1:50:29.200 --> 1:50:31.680]  michael said we have to redouble our efforts
[1:50:31.680 --> 1:50:36.000]  right now now is the time to call your father your brother your sister
[1:50:36.000 --> 1:50:40.480]  and let them know this is really happening in the united states of america
[1:50:40.480 --> 1:50:44.080]  and it really supersedes administrations they put this
[1:50:44.080 --> 1:50:47.840]  prison into play in 2007 under the bush administration
[1:50:47.840 --> 1:50:51.600]  it's going to become a hot zone under the obama administration

[1:54:08.960 --> 1:54:12.800]  final segment with ex-military personnel michael hollingsworth
[1:54:12.800 --> 1:54:16.560]  who's on the scene at harden montana really helped break this story
[1:54:16.560 --> 1:54:19.680]  yesterday and in this final segment i want to
[1:54:19.680 --> 1:54:23.840]  discuss how they used an economically destitute region
[1:54:23.840 --> 1:54:27.680]  to pull this off and your conversation with becky shea where she in no
[1:54:27.680 --> 1:54:30.640]  uncertain terms said hey this is what i was driving
[1:54:30.640 --> 1:54:35.600]  a week ago now that i've taken this job now i'm driving this
[1:54:35.600 --> 1:54:39.600]  yeah exactly now it's good well you know and the funny thing is that
[1:54:39.600 --> 1:54:43.360]  while mishay strikes me as a very nice lady um she also strikes me as someone
[1:54:43.360 --> 1:54:46.480]  who was just overtaken by the fact that they threw a check at her
[1:54:46.480 --> 1:54:50.160]  you know when i asked her in the in the conversation i very very
[1:54:50.160 --> 1:54:53.440]  candidly used the term targeted i said so mishay essentially what you guys have
[1:54:53.440 --> 1:54:56.320]  done is you you went around and you targeted these really
[1:54:56.320 --> 1:54:58.960]  destitute towns everything she goes well i don't know so much that it was
[1:54:58.960 --> 1:55:02.160]  targeted with the word but that we did an intense
[1:55:02.160 --> 1:55:06.000]  introspective financial analysis kind of thing which is it's basically taking
[1:55:06.000 --> 1:55:08.720]  the power out of the word but you know it makes perfect sense
[1:55:08.720 --> 1:55:11.920]  it makes absolutely perfect sense if you want to destroy a nation from the
[1:55:11.920 --> 1:55:14.720]  inside out the first thing you do is attack its financial infrastructure
[1:55:14.720 --> 1:55:17.680]  because if it doesn't have money it doesn't have anything
[1:55:17.680 --> 1:55:20.640]  so you put these people out of their homes you put them out of jobs you put
[1:55:20.640 --> 1:55:23.280]  them out of everything they have and then you make them much more dependent
[1:55:23.280 --> 1:55:25.920]  on the government handouts you know we saw this you know
[1:55:25.920 --> 1:55:29.040]  there's still how much money of the financial bailout wait a minute they
[1:55:29.040 --> 1:55:32.720]  mean the stimulus plan that obama put into effect that's unaccounted for
[1:55:32.720 --> 1:55:35.920]  you know now we're starting to see exactly how this whirlwind is starting
[1:55:35.920 --> 1:55:38.800]  to connect all of them even follow that money man
[1:55:38.800 --> 1:55:42.160]  you know so this is how are they going to come in with multiple millions of
[1:55:42.160 --> 1:55:44.240]  dollars to rescue towns like harden i don't know
[1:55:44.240 --> 1:55:46.800]  with their provisions and that in the stimulus plan
[1:55:46.800 --> 1:55:50.480]  you know all unidentified yeah see now this is all the connections that's
[1:55:50.480 --> 1:55:52.960]  being made that people are finally starting to see
[1:55:52.960 --> 1:55:56.320]  you know including the people devoted for barack obama and you know and i'm
[1:55:56.320 --> 1:55:58.880]  gonna be bold and step out on the limb and i'm going to suggest that yes this
[1:55:58.880 --> 1:56:02.640]  corruption may very well go all the way to the white house
[1:56:02.640 --> 1:56:05.120]  so you know essentially what we're looking at right now is you're looking at a
[1:56:05.120 --> 1:56:09.680]  company that came in they used a very very well planned
[1:56:09.680 --> 1:56:15.200]  but poorly executed uh network of people that came in
[1:56:15.200 --> 1:56:18.080]  wanted to do this analysis found out that the city of harden that's not just
[1:56:18.080 --> 1:56:20.800]  harden there's several she actually slipped and said that there were several
[1:56:20.800 --> 1:56:23.360]  other cities that they were looking at doing this and although she wouldn't
[1:56:23.360 --> 1:56:26.480]  declare which ones they were okay so they look at this this is called

[2:02:29.680 --> 2:02:35.440]  hello yes ma'am hi um i have i okay um i'm kind of nervous i've been waiting
[2:02:35.440 --> 2:02:39.760]  for a while um i've recently watched the videos
[2:02:39.760 --> 2:02:43.520]  and and what you guys were talking about just a moment ago about the um
[2:02:43.520 --> 2:02:50.320]  about in harden harden uh montana um one question that i have
[2:02:50.320 --> 2:02:56.640]  is i've heard only briefly something in regards to taking kids away
[2:02:56.640 --> 2:03:01.680]  from their parents something having to do with um the vaccination
[2:03:01.680 --> 2:03:04.560]  do you have any do you have any further information on that because that's
[2:03:04.560 --> 2:03:07.920]  pretty much all that i heard well they're saying that they they're uh
[2:03:07.920 --> 2:03:11.360]  the article i just read out of abalone in texas they're saying it's mandatory
[2:03:11.360 --> 2:03:15.120]  they're saying that yes it will be an excused absence at first but it may
[2:03:15.120 --> 2:03:17.920]  not last that long and if they have 10
[2:03:17.920 --> 2:03:21.600]  unexcused absences then they're truant and they'll have to repeat the grade and
[2:03:21.600 --> 2:03:25.040]  of course they've used truancy before to bring cps in
[2:03:25.040 --> 2:03:28.320]  and say oh we need to come into your home or oh we need to take your children
[2:03:28.320 --> 2:03:32.800]  so you have to be very careful but at the same time i'd rather battle cps
[2:03:32.800 --> 2:03:36.800]  than battle autism from my child taking this or some kind of a heart condition
[2:03:36.800 --> 2:03:39.840]  or gilliams bear or them losing motion in their
[2:03:39.840 --> 2:03:45.280]  legs or arms so you know what no matter what do not allow your child to take
[2:03:45.280 --> 2:03:48.960]  this shot look at this media hype for this girl who died
[2:03:48.960 --> 2:03:52.640]  two hours she she dies two hours after she takes the shot
[2:03:52.640 --> 2:03:57.280]  for cervical cancer aka hpv and now what is the mainstream media saying
[2:03:57.280 --> 2:04:01.760]  oh she didn't die from the from the injection she had a tumor in her chest
[2:04:01.760 --> 2:04:06.720]  as if that tumor was so fast acting that she died within the two hours she took
[2:04:06.720 --> 2:04:10.880]  this cervical cancer shot it's unbelievable it's unconscionable and
[2:04:10.880 --> 2:04:14.240]  remember they're pushing this on young children they're pushing it on the
[2:04:14.240 --> 2:04:17.280]  parents and they're pushing it on pregnant women
[2:04:17.280 --> 2:04:21.520]  meanwhile health workers in albany new york gathered in front of the capital

[2:09:22.240 --> 2:09:25.520]  to have this be a ghost site but locals blew the whistle
[2:09:25.520 --> 2:09:28.800]  they were definitely going to try to become the police through the
[2:09:28.800 --> 2:09:32.320]  two rivers authority basically taking over the town
[2:09:32.320 --> 2:09:35.840]  of heart this individual is tied in with high-powered
[2:09:35.840 --> 2:09:38.880]  uh... serve operatives his dad is some type of
[2:09:38.880 --> 2:09:42.160]  uh... high-ranking uh... uh... serve

[2:09:48.320 --> 2:09:50.960]  uh... there are german troops here german paramilitaries

[2:12:06.480 --> 2:12:10.080]  yes absolutely alex i'd just like to also point out that one of our listeners
[2:12:10.080 --> 2:12:14.720]  did call in and contact blackwater from canada where he asked if there were any
[2:12:14.720 --> 2:12:18.000]  operations going on with blackwater in canada he said no
[2:12:18.000 --> 2:12:22.240]  but we are beginning operations in montana yet more confirmation
[2:12:22.240 --> 2:12:24.800]  hold on barmas we got steve quill uh becky tell us we're about to have the
[2:12:24.800 --> 2:12:28.560]  church we're going to take the tour we're going to go around the back of the facility and i'm going to
[2:12:28.560 --> 2:12:33.280]  we have some landmarks to him okay thank you let's go ahead let's go ahead
[2:12:33.280 --> 2:12:36.880]  thanks for letting me visit with you today he's very nice let's go ahead and bring
[2:12:36.880 --> 2:12:40.320]  steve up right now steve give us your take on the situation
[2:12:40.320 --> 2:12:47.120]  well situation alex is uh as as the press has broken on the past background
[2:12:47.120 --> 2:12:53.040]  of hilton and then obviously paul watson writing on the tie-in with blackwater
[2:12:53.040 --> 2:12:56.240]  uh i just got up the phone with someone up in the flathead valley
[2:12:56.240 --> 2:12:59.600]  who's talking now this is all relevant to what you're doing down there
[2:12:59.600 --> 2:13:02.800]  the presence of blackwater training uh foreign
[2:13:02.800 --> 2:13:06.640]  uh military up in the canadian border area between
[2:13:06.640 --> 2:13:11.680]  flathead the flathead valley and up to eureka montana etc so the point is
[2:13:11.680 --> 2:13:15.680]  is that given the nature of by the way i talked to becky
[2:13:15.680 --> 2:13:19.520]  shea yesterday too the lady you're talking to on the phone and my film crew
[2:13:19.520 --> 2:13:23.520]  that i sent down there was down there yesterday but obviously the situation
[2:13:23.520 --> 2:13:27.120]  that i think everyone's got to understand is you follow the money trail
[2:13:27.120 --> 2:13:31.680]  it is my contention that we're seeing uh front men who are put out there that
[2:13:31.680 --> 2:13:36.800]  are willing to take the heat to hide the real ownership and the real purpose
[2:13:36.800 --> 2:13:40.880]  you need to ask becky what the uh 10 to 16 000 acres
[2:13:40.880 --> 2:13:44.640]  is going to be used for that she told us she told us steve she said that they
[2:13:44.640 --> 2:13:48.160]  are getting additional acres for an international uh paramilitary training
[2:13:48.160 --> 2:13:52.400]  facility well again ask ask her then what who the
[2:13:52.400 --> 2:13:56.080]  international paramilitary is going to be trained for because the radio
[2:13:56.080 --> 2:13:59.680]  alex says you and i are on the radio right now i'm getting uh
[2:13:59.680 --> 2:14:02.880]  uh people that are listening in to us saying that they're observing and you
[2:14:02.880 --> 2:14:06.880]  flew into billings did you fly into billings yes we've had local cellists
[2:14:06.880 --> 2:14:11.040]  and callers to the show that they've seen black envies blackhawk helicopters men
[2:14:11.040 --> 2:14:16.800]  training in the hills right and in the area that you are at the
[2:14:16.800 --> 2:14:20.800]  thing that i think is really important for all the listeners is to realize that
[2:14:20.800 --> 2:14:26.560]  uh reservations have different rules and regulations which allows a lot of foreign
[2:14:26.560 --> 2:14:30.640]  corporations and foreign military issues like on tomo that's why they moved
[2:14:30.640 --> 2:14:34.800]  it there because it's a no man plan steve i'm here getting a tour from becky
[2:14:34.800 --> 2:14:37.360]  right now i want to keep you for i know we said we only have you for 20 minutes
[2:14:37.360 --> 2:14:40.640]  you're very busy i'm going to be leaving in about 10 minutes can you give us a
[2:14:40.640 --> 2:14:43.920]  full report at the bottom of the hour since we're getting the tour right now

[2:14:48.640 --> 2:14:52.400]  where you well call me off air because i would have to call you this morning the
[2:14:52.400 --> 2:14:56.400]  things started moving so fast we are in we are in one of the

[2:15:37.840 --> 2:15:41.440]  and i'm going to point out the boundaries of our land um
[2:15:41.440 --> 2:15:46.000]  uh where the boundaries are to our good neighbors the co-indian nation
[2:15:46.000 --> 2:15:50.000]  and where we intend to do some construction on this property

[2:16:16.880 --> 2:16:20.160]  sure and uh what about blackwater connections we've been hearing a lot
[2:16:20.160 --> 2:16:22.880]  about bed and the company and in several places as bragging they have
[2:16:22.880 --> 2:16:26.720]  blackwater connections i've heard so many names but it's just
[2:16:26.720 --> 2:16:31.680]  absolutely phenomenal to me we're not disclosing the name of our parent
[2:16:31.680 --> 2:16:35.680]  company i'm and that's just that's it we're not
[2:16:35.680 --> 2:16:39.680]  disclosing the name of our parent company we stand alone there's a parent
[2:16:39.680 --> 2:16:43.600]  company well there is a parent company of american police force there is an
[2:16:43.600 --> 2:16:48.000]  umbrella company american police force stands alone as a corporation
[2:16:48.000 --> 2:16:52.960]  um and and we are american police force we are who we are but if it's a
[2:16:52.960 --> 2:16:56.880]  secretive group owned by a secret group and then it's headed by a 14-time
[2:16:56.880 --> 2:17:00.320]  felon and then they were putting police decals on their vehicles the first few
[2:17:00.320 --> 2:17:02.320]  days i mean don't people have a right to be a little
[2:17:02.320 --> 2:17:05.760]  bit concerned about this Becky i think people have a right to whatever

[2:19:13.200 --> 2:19:16.640]  the level eastern montana wind and for you might hear something about in the
[2:19:16.640 --> 2:19:21.120]  background two river detention facility is owned
[2:19:21.120 --> 2:19:25.680]  was built and owned by river authority which is the port authority
[2:19:25.680 --> 2:19:30.160]  that was created under montana law is the economic development wing of the
[2:19:30.160 --> 2:19:37.280]  city of hearted this facility is built for is uh accredited for
[2:19:37.280 --> 2:19:41.200]  and has the authority for and will only hold
[2:19:41.200 --> 2:19:45.120]  minimum and medium security offenders and those
[2:19:45.120 --> 2:19:48.480]  under the authorities were how we're allowed to operate
[2:19:48.480 --> 2:19:54.000]  those offenders can only come from local state and federal jurisdiction so
[2:19:54.000 --> 2:19:57.200]  that might be another county in montana that might be the state your
[2:19:57.200 --> 2:20:01.600]  listener that you're sitting in right now um if they need to make that
[2:20:01.600 --> 2:20:06.240]  connection then then we can make that connection but
[2:20:06.240 --> 2:20:10.640]  um right now right now we're trying to open
[2:20:10.640 --> 2:20:15.360]  100 000 square foot detention facility that's been shuttered for two years
[2:20:15.360 --> 2:20:19.520]  now when when we kind of cut out there alex was saying to me
[2:20:19.520 --> 2:20:24.400]  he saw some documents in the building my explanation for that was
[2:20:24.400 --> 2:20:28.960]  the former contractee that was going to operate this facility
[2:20:28.960 --> 2:20:32.640]  had some plans when they walked away from hearted they dropped everything and
[2:20:32.640 --> 2:20:35.840]  they walked away they left everything from mustard
[2:20:35.840 --> 2:20:39.440]  pockets and plastic spoons and crumbs and desk drawers
[2:20:39.440 --> 2:20:43.600]  to the documents that alex was referring to to letterhead
[2:20:43.600 --> 2:20:47.200]  so right now as we come in we're doing a couple things we're cleaning this place
[2:20:47.200 --> 2:20:51.440]  head to toe and we're making sure that it's ready for whoever comes in and
[2:20:51.440 --> 2:20:54.880]  contracts to take care to hold offenders here
[2:20:54.880 --> 2:20:58.240]  and i want to make it clear that that's always going to be local control it's
[2:20:58.240 --> 2:21:01.680]  always going to be the people of harden who have the final say
[2:21:01.680 --> 2:21:05.840]  on what offenders are still held here and they will be
[2:21:05.840 --> 2:21:09.120]  only minimum and media security offenders
[2:21:09.120 --> 2:21:13.920]  um and now i'm going to give this phone back to alex who's been visiting with my
[2:21:13.920 --> 2:21:17.440]  neighbors here in harden and we're going to give the nicole fewer but i'm going
[2:21:17.440 --> 2:21:21.040]  to give the phone back to you alex so that i can accommodate my other guests
[2:21:21.040 --> 2:21:27.040]  that's okay great thank you and alex i just want to point out that our intel
[2:21:27.040 --> 2:21:31.520]  is pointing to to the parent company being called dps that's what a story
[2:21:31.520 --> 2:21:37.520]  we're developing right now at the moment dps dps dps
[2:21:37.520 --> 2:21:41.200]  dps sir okay it's very hard to hear you in this wind
[2:21:41.200 --> 2:21:45.840]  say it slowly dps and there are links on the forum in a story
[2:21:45.840 --> 2:21:51.200]  as in donkey yes yes dps sir so it's like it's like the department of
[2:21:51.200 --> 2:21:57.600]  public safety in texas dps yes yes becky is the parent company dps
[2:21:57.600 --> 2:22:01.360]  you're not releasing the name of the parent company apf is
[2:22:01.360 --> 2:22:05.600]  is the one apf is the corporation the publicly filed for
[2:22:05.600 --> 2:22:07.840]  the show
[2:22:08.160 --> 2:22:11.920]  that is we uh barmas listen i wanted quail to be able to ask her questions
[2:22:11.920 --> 2:22:14.720]  that's why i got him on is he coming back at the bottom of the hour uh i
[2:22:14.720 --> 2:22:19.280]  believe so jaren's saying yes okay well i wanted to i wanted to have him stay
[2:22:19.280 --> 2:22:22.160]  on hold so he could comment but i just want to point out he was right about
[2:22:22.160 --> 2:22:24.800]  this last week he was the one saying that was the felon
[2:22:24.800 --> 2:22:28.480]  even before that was anywhere he was the one and i don't think about steve you
[2:22:28.480 --> 2:22:31.920]  know sometimes it sounds wild but in my case it's always turned out to be
[2:22:31.920 --> 2:22:36.800]  true when it's political uh i mean i mean this is just this is wild
[2:22:36.800 --> 2:22:41.040]  bernard and let me say this alex you know the the headline over at us a
[2:22:41.040 --> 2:22:44.480]  today in the first paragraph let me read it for listeners a secret of california
[2:22:44.480 --> 2:22:48.000]  outfit called american police force is taking over a two-year-old never used
[2:22:48.000 --> 2:22:50.800]  prison in harden montana that was briefly
[2:22:50.800 --> 2:22:55.200]  considered as a possible spot for guantanamo prisoners so that is in the
[2:22:55.200 --> 2:22:59.680]  first paragraph of usa today we are checking our sources here it's right
[2:22:59.680 --> 2:23:02.320]  in front of me and again i think that they're using this
[2:23:02.320 --> 2:23:06.960]  guantanamo prisoners excuse to say yes this will be a training facility
[2:23:06.960 --> 2:23:11.040]  for foreign troops and mercenary operations that isn't gonna be guantanamo
[2:23:11.040 --> 2:23:14.800]  west and i want to be clear you know we've been reporting this since sunday
[2:23:14.800 --> 2:23:17.520]  and monday and tuesday and then on wednesday and thursday
[2:23:17.520 --> 2:23:21.200]  uh into into thursday and people were in denial they were they said it was fake
[2:23:21.200 --> 2:23:24.560]  when we broke the maniac report they said it was fake when we broke the dhs
[2:23:24.560 --> 2:23:27.280]  report they said it was fake when we broke that we were under level six in
[2:23:27.280 --> 2:23:29.840]  april two months later was admitted mainstream news
[2:23:29.840 --> 2:23:33.840]  ladies and gentlemen we don't make stuff up this is real this is a ghost site
[2:23:33.840 --> 2:23:38.800]  slash black site that we have on this is this is a fema center they want to hold
[2:23:38.800 --> 2:23:42.240]  she was telling me i saw a blueprint all over the place scanning them quickly
[2:23:42.240 --> 2:23:45.280]  that was walking into the facility and she'd say oh don't take that or don't
[2:23:45.280 --> 2:23:49.520]  you know don't show that where it was saying alien detention uh you know uh
[2:23:49.520 --> 2:23:53.360]  uh you know you know troop barracks processing facility she admitted they're
[2:23:53.360 --> 2:23:57.200]  going to do training to process people and to go out and set up checkpoints
[2:23:57.200 --> 2:24:01.280]  with with CAT scan scanners is the way she calls scan people's good
[2:24:01.280 --> 2:24:05.120]  so this is a huge processing center i don't think she even knows everything
[2:24:05.120 --> 2:24:09.200]  she seems pretty freaked out she gets hired finds out all this and all the
[2:24:09.200 --> 2:24:14.400]  serbs and the germans and the brits have all fled but i was pretty smart
[2:24:14.400 --> 2:24:18.240]  we went to the interview bed and breakfasts because there's hardly any hotels here
[2:24:18.240 --> 2:24:21.760]  so we went to the one hotel the one uh hotel eight
[2:24:21.760 --> 2:24:25.680]  we went to three different bed and breakfasts uh at two of the places
[2:24:25.680 --> 2:24:32.960]  they said oh absolutely germans uh checks uh brits uh a lot of serbs
[2:24:32.960 --> 2:24:37.120]  are really hardcore looking people won't pay in cash act really suspicious they've
[2:24:37.120 --> 2:24:41.840]  been here for a year i mean this is insane what we're dealing with up here
[2:24:41.840 --> 2:24:44.560]  and they're just trying to like it all fine we're not going to our parent
[2:24:44.560 --> 2:24:49.280]  company everything's fine everything's wonderful i mean this is bizarro land
[2:24:49.280 --> 2:24:52.480]  and they try to start patrolling the town with their vehicles that blow up at
[2:24:52.480 --> 2:24:56.960]  their face uh this is insane well you know another question i would ask her
[2:24:56.960 --> 2:25:01.360]  is if those uh documents indeed are contracted by a different entity that
[2:25:01.360 --> 2:25:05.280]  is no longer involved what entity is that surely she can tell you who that is
[2:25:05.280 --> 2:25:09.520]  if she can't disclose she won't disclose who these who the people who were
[2:25:09.520 --> 2:25:12.560]  going to make this guantanamo westward even though those documents were up
[2:25:12.560 --> 2:25:14.480]  everywhere she's saying that they left these
[2:25:14.480 --> 2:25:18.160]  documents at quote unquote mustard packets she won't say what company that
[2:25:18.160 --> 2:25:21.200]  is why protect a company that's no longer involved in this
[2:25:21.200 --> 2:25:26.160]  detention center i think we're going to find it to the mpps
[2:25:26.160 --> 2:25:31.840]  this is just so incredible and so fast moving again within the past couple
[2:25:31.840 --> 2:25:35.040]  hours the associated press
[2:25:35.040 --> 2:25:37.840]  but if you want the real deal here we are at a real life in the camp where they
[2:25:37.840 --> 2:25:41.760]  pronounce that's what they wanted for totally secretive with foreign mercs
[2:25:41.760 --> 2:25:45.280]  uh running it admitting they want to expand it at a 15 000 other acre
[2:25:45.280 --> 2:25:48.800]  facility they want to build there's a british architecture in town designing
[2:25:48.800 --> 2:25:53.120]  it this is the real deal okay this is a real live
[2:25:53.120 --> 2:25:57.600]  ghost site being a camp in the making on a silver platter for everyone
[2:25:57.600 --> 2:26:01.360]  this is the shadow government system as all the old intel people told us
[2:26:01.360 --> 2:26:03.920]  decades ago they said they will be run by foreign mercs
[2:26:03.920 --> 2:26:07.600]  everything the old militia guy said is absolutely true because they were all
[2:26:07.600 --> 2:26:10.400]  in the military they were all in intelligence they were all in african
[2:26:10.400 --> 2:26:13.600]  asia and latin america the middle east saw how it was done there and that is
[2:26:13.600 --> 2:26:18.320]  exactly what's being set up because it's so poor they can take it
[2:26:18.320 --> 2:26:22.160]  over they have this few rivers authority muscling around uh the former
[2:26:22.160 --> 2:26:24.400]  director of this place is why it's running for mayor
[2:26:24.400 --> 2:26:27.200]  i mean this is serious and it is dangerous ladies and gentlemen i'll tell you
[2:26:27.200 --> 2:26:30.720]  that right now because they do have operators and people following us
[2:26:30.720 --> 2:26:34.400]  we've been getting followed by white sedans uh when we try to go and videotape
[2:26:34.400 --> 2:26:38.320]  them they speed off uh so this is a serious business here in arden
[2:26:38.320 --> 2:26:41.440]  montana and steve quayle going to come up in the
[2:26:41.440 --> 2:26:45.040]  bottom of the hour he'd like to break some news with you alex so hopefully
[2:26:45.040 --> 2:26:48.560]  you'll be able to join us in another 20 or 25 minutes it is
[2:26:48.560 --> 2:26:53.200]  incredible once again we have somebody who is a convicted felon who has over
[2:26:53.200 --> 2:26:59.040]  a dozen aliases who has a over a dozen felony convictions who is a a million
[2:26:59.040 --> 2:27:03.520]  plus in the whole from civil suits he's lost a person who has presented himself
[2:27:03.520 --> 2:27:07.040]  as an arts dealer a person who has presented himself as a car salesman
[2:27:07.040 --> 2:27:11.360]  as an entrepreneur as a restaurant owner and a foreign
[2:27:11.360 --> 2:27:16.560]  murk it blows my mind alex and this is who the new order uses this is the
[2:27:16.560 --> 2:27:20.000]  shady criminals 14 dime felons they use this cut out front
[2:27:20.000 --> 2:27:23.280]  the new order is a criminal rogue government operation to rape the
[2:27:23.280 --> 2:27:25.120]  hell out of the american people people the planet
[2:27:25.120 --> 2:27:29.600]  if they greased 1,300,000 iraqis they'll do it here too ladies and gentlemen
[2:27:29.600 --> 2:27:32.160]  that's why they state the terror that's why they do all of this that's what
[2:27:32.160 --> 2:27:35.600]  this country's run by it's criminals looting the hell out of us
[2:27:35.600 --> 2:27:39.440]  and it continues and continues and continues and again this facility
[2:27:39.440 --> 2:27:43.360]  started in 2007 under the bush administration they waited for the
[2:27:43.360 --> 2:27:47.200]  obama administration to come in as the economy has got it
[2:27:47.200 --> 2:27:52.400]  now they're looking at montana two different facilities this one
[2:27:52.400 --> 2:27:57.200]  yes and they're integrating again i am at a triple confirmed
[2:27:57.200 --> 2:28:02.800]  murk run facility where they're going to build a giant induction center to
[2:28:02.800 --> 2:28:06.880]  search everybody as you go into it you don't search and can't stand luggage
[2:28:06.880 --> 2:28:11.040]  of prisoners i mean i mean they're doing airport
[2:28:11.040 --> 2:28:15.120]  style training they're going to train police you name it foreign mercs
[2:28:15.120 --> 2:28:18.800]  militaries everything here just unbelievable
[2:28:18.800 --> 2:28:22.560]  she said it's a one-stop shop and i'm sure it will be confirmed
[2:28:22.560 --> 2:28:26.640]  that black water is involved within the week if not within the next couple of
[2:28:26.640 --> 2:28:30.720]  days again we're going to say in a story that i believe from memory
[2:28:30.720 --> 2:28:34.800]  matter of the concentration camp field that it's confirmed black water

[2:28:42.800 --> 2:28:47.040]  it it becomes irrefutable and now again we're having listeners call in
[2:28:47.040 --> 2:28:50.400]  with double confirmation saying they have contacted black water
[2:28:50.400 --> 2:28:54.560]  and they have confirmed that they do have units moving into montana as we

[2:33:28.240 --> 2:33:38.240]  He's last Friday when he called me. I was so busy I didn't get on my radar screen until Sunday. It didn't break officially in mainstream news to the Billings Gazette yesterday.
[2:33:38.240 --> 2:33:52.240]  And so it's the front page of Billings Gazette again today that this serve gentleman is this 14-time felon. But I wanted to let Steve be able to talk to Becky Shave because she's been very, very helpful and has not been secretive like the other folks out here.
[2:33:52.240 --> 2:34:04.240]  So I wanted to hand the phone to her for five minutes and Steve Quill is going to give us huge breaking news and developments. And then we'll throw it back to Jason Berman and I'll call in later in the next hour to recap this after the tour is complete.
[2:34:04.240 --> 2:34:15.240]  Steve Quill, here is Becky Shave. Hi Becky. Hey Steve, we're supposed to talk today. What a strange way to do it on Alex's phone, huh? Well, yeah, it's wonderful and thank you so much.
[2:34:15.240 --> 2:34:31.240]  Here's some of the questions that I think really need to be answered, okay? There has seemed to be a systematic effort to hide the true ownership and I understand DPS to understand the attorney Maziar Mopi, you know, describing the Santa Ana, California ownership, et cetera.
[2:34:31.240 --> 2:34:43.240]  But when you go to Edi Angelino, have you ever met with him personally? No, Steve, I haven't. And I just want to let you know that, and just to be sure, I'm telling you upfront.
[2:34:43.240 --> 2:34:51.240]  And I hope your listeners, you know, are we on the air? Are your listeners here with us? I just had Alex hand me a phone. I don't know who I'm talking to together.
[2:34:51.240 --> 2:35:05.240]  Yes, we're on the air. Okay, we're on the air. I am not going to release the name of anyone we're affiliated with. And I know some of you know, I've visited with Mr. Mopi.
[2:35:05.240 --> 2:35:18.240]  The other name that you mentioned is not a name that I recognize. I can speak and will only speak for APF. I can't speak to other corporations that you've visited with.
[2:35:18.240 --> 2:35:34.240]  But the other thing that I want to let your listeners know, we are sitting in the edge, we are sitting in my block SUV, but there is no other, I am the only person with APF equipment in Hardin.
[2:35:34.240 --> 2:35:40.240]  There is no other equipment from APF in Hardin other than me and my laptop in this car.
[2:35:40.240 --> 2:35:53.240]  Well, I got to tell you then, Becky, that contradicts multiple eyewitnesses that said initially there were 12 and then it went down to three. And I have posted on my website the actual photographs of the seal that said American police force.
[2:35:53.240 --> 2:35:55.240]  And so here's the question, why would you want to...
[2:35:55.240 --> 2:36:13.240]  Let me clarify for you that the seals were magnetic blockers that are gone. And I challenge you, and respectfully, Steve, I really do, I challenge you respectfully to find good proof that there were 12 vehicles in this town.
[2:36:13.240 --> 2:36:16.240]  Only three came into town and I got one of them.
[2:36:16.240 --> 2:36:26.240]  With all due respect to your sources, there were not 12 APF vehicles in this town.
[2:36:26.240 --> 2:36:42.240]  Okay, now let's go to the issue. The privatization of police force in Hardin, okay? The idea was that there were those decals and obviously someone gave the order to take them off because it was causing controversy when apparently...
[2:36:42.240 --> 2:36:59.240]  Since you won't discuss the ownership of the company, and I respect that, okay? But I'm only going to tell you that there's independent verification that has been supplied to both Alex Jones and myself from people in the law enforcement community showing...
[2:36:59.240 --> 2:37:19.240]  Alex, that's product solutions. Yeah, absolutely. Foreign ownership and aliases used that would, I think, make most Americans go, there's something going on. Now, are you familiar with the main reason why Alex, myself, and others are concerned when we hear about the privatization and the takeover of police forces in America?
[2:37:19.240 --> 2:37:29.240]  You are. Let me explain. Let's talk about that privatization issue, okay? Okay.
[2:37:29.240 --> 2:37:39.240]  Under Montana law, the only entity that can provide law enforcement services is local government.
[2:37:39.240 --> 2:37:52.240]  Hold on one second, Becky. Hold on one second, Steve. Steve, are you getting into another cutout is defense product solutions out of Karachi, Pakistan, because that's where the website goes to American police force?
[2:37:52.240 --> 2:38:02.240]  Yeah, and that is an additional cutout for Kuwait, okay? And then just, I want to put Becky on notice, Becky, not unnoticed, but I just want to give you information.
[2:38:02.240 --> 2:38:10.240]  I'm going to hand you back over to her. Steve, I'm going to hand you back over to her. I just wanted to get that out right now. This is mega huge, because this is the plan for the whole United States.
[2:38:10.240 --> 2:38:19.240]  And Becky, isn't it true that I've seen you quoted the news and talking to folks on the phone that I've talked to, that the American police force does plan other facilities around the country?
[2:38:19.240 --> 2:38:32.240]  Okay, first of all, I want to explain to people that I have a face for radio, and when Alex came over here and leaned in and yelled into the phone to Steve, my face lit up because I just thought it was funnier than I'll get out.
[2:38:32.240 --> 2:38:34.240]  That's the only, I just looked at you and went, oh my God.
[2:38:34.240 --> 2:38:37.240]  There's no serbs. There's no Muslims. Everything's fine.
[2:38:37.240 --> 2:38:43.240]  You know, you're just talking to a nice Montana girl right now. Steve, let me get back to the topic. I need to get back to the point.
[2:38:43.240 --> 2:38:49.240]  I know you are. That's why we're talking. I want to get back to the topic for just a minute.
[2:38:49.240 --> 2:38:57.240]  But if you would please give me the opportunity to respond to the question that we were on when Alex came over and cracked me up.
[2:38:57.240 --> 2:39:10.240]  And we were talking about what I was saying was the only way that law enforcement services can be delivered in Montana is through a local governmental entity.
[2:39:10.240 --> 2:39:20.240]  Now, that's the city of Hardin. And I'm sure you understand, and I think your Montana listeners understand that your audience is much larger than that.
[2:39:20.240 --> 2:39:26.240]  So give me three minutes to explain the context of why Hardin doesn't have a police force. Do we have time to do that?
[2:39:26.240 --> 2:39:28.240]  Absolutely.
[2:39:28.240 --> 2:39:41.240]  Back in 1976, Hardin and Bighorn County took advantage or used the structure allowed under Montana law to consolidate their law enforcement services.
[2:39:41.240 --> 2:39:50.240]  By doing so, the Sheriff's Office provides all in law enforcement within the city of Hardin in addition to all of Bighorn County.
[2:39:50.240 --> 2:40:06.240]  There has been negotiations between the city and county most recently that have come to the point that they are choosing to deconsolidate law enforcement and Hardin will create its own police department.
[2:40:06.240 --> 2:40:15.240]  Now, folks, think about it. It is incredibly expensive to create, to develop, to build from the ground up a police department.
[2:40:15.240 --> 2:40:23.240]  And this community is going to try and do that in one of the poorest counties in the state of Montana. So that amplifies the challenges.
[2:40:23.240 --> 2:40:35.240]  This summer, when TRA, Two Rivers Authority, Hardin's Economic Development Arm, was working with representatives of APS, too. Alex was laying in at me again and I jumped.
[2:40:35.240 --> 2:40:47.240]  Hold on one second. Steve, I just want to bring up Article 2, Section 33 of the Montana Incorporation as a state on a legislature in a duly convened powers of the people in the sovereign state of Montana in the United States.
[2:40:47.240 --> 2:40:59.240]  It says, importation of armed persons, no armed person or persons of armed body of men shall be brought into the state for the preservation of peace or the suppression of domestic violence except upon application of the legislature or of the governor.
[2:40:59.240 --> 2:41:11.240]  The legislature cannot be convened for further and then it goes on. Now, here's the issue. They did put the decals on the cars. The head of the Port Authority, as they call it, Two Rivers, has said that it's a wish list.
[2:41:11.240 --> 2:41:26.240]  You know, the point is you've got a 14-time felon. You've got all this secrecy. They won't tell us who the owner of the company is. Becky, you're nice to talk to us and we appreciate it, but people are concerned and freaked out about all of this because every red flag you could push up is popping up.
[2:41:26.240 --> 2:41:36.240]  We've got Arabs. We've got Serbs. We've got Germans. We've got Brits crawling all over the place around here. The people are freaking out. I mean, is this sometimes a red dawn scenario, Becky?
[2:41:36.240 --> 2:41:46.240]  Alex, if you could take the phone away from me, you'd know that we were already talking about that. Stay and listen or leave me alone. It's fine.
[2:41:46.240 --> 2:41:57.240]  Okay, here's the deal. So, as part of meeting the needs of the city of Hardin where we're coming in and we're going to be a neighbor, Hardin said, We need help with infrastructure.
[2:41:57.240 --> 2:42:04.240]  APF said, We want to provide your first vehicles. We'll bring them in. You can have the vehicles.
[2:42:04.240 --> 2:42:22.240]  No, this is before I was hired with APF. The decision was made to buy temporary prototypes, magnetic placards to go on the doors that would let the people of Hardin know what their police vehicles could look like.
[2:42:22.240 --> 2:42:32.240]  One of the things that your kind viewers who took those pictures and provided you with the decals, Steve, you got those pictures. Alex said he did.
[2:42:32.240 --> 2:42:43.240]  Hello? Okay, the thing that they missed was the sign on the back window that said, Not for official use and transport only.
[2:42:43.240 --> 2:42:45.240]  Well, forgive me.
[2:42:45.240 --> 2:42:53.240]  They didn't get the whole picture. It's kind of like the 312 thing we talked about. Let me keep doing that because I promised your listeners that I would explain this to them.
[2:42:53.240 --> 2:42:56.240]  Right, but you've had now three minutes. Let me just respond one minute to that.
[2:42:56.240 --> 2:43:04.240]  Well, wait a minute. Alex took the phone for 90 seconds. Alex came on the line and he talked about bringing armed folks into Montana.
[2:43:04.240 --> 2:43:05.240]  The gentleman...
[2:43:05.240 --> 2:43:08.240]  No, no, it was the state constitution. I know it's evil, but...
[2:43:08.240 --> 2:43:10.240]  No, it's not evil. I live by it.
[2:43:10.240 --> 2:43:11.240]  The gentleman there...
[2:43:11.240 --> 2:43:16.240]  Well, you can't say that because it is unconstitutional. You can't say you live by something that's unconstitutional.
[2:43:16.240 --> 2:43:19.240]  Now, the thing that is that I think you need to be aware...
[2:43:19.240 --> 2:43:20.240]  Now, let me finish.
[2:43:20.240 --> 2:43:21.240]  No, you need to be aware...
[2:43:21.240 --> 2:43:22.240]  Let me finish.
[2:43:22.240 --> 2:43:26.240]  Let me finish because you're saying something that I don't get a chance to respond to, okay?
[2:43:26.240 --> 2:43:27.240]  Okay, okay, okay.
[2:43:27.240 --> 2:43:33.240]  Those people carried a Serbian crest on them. We tracked the ownership of the company that used that.
[2:43:33.240 --> 2:43:37.240]  APF took down their website. Seriously, you need to know this.
[2:43:37.240 --> 2:43:42.240]  Well, my webmaster and I were on the phone. It was down, it was up, it was down, it was up.
[2:43:42.240 --> 2:43:46.240]  The thing is, is that one thing led to another, Becky, and I'm just saying this.
[2:43:46.240 --> 2:43:52.240]  It's conceivable that what you know is what you know, what you've been told, and you take it at face value.
[2:43:52.240 --> 2:43:55.240]  And I understand Hardin's economic plight. I live in Montana.
[2:43:55.240 --> 2:43:58.240]  Have for the past 40 years, so I know what's going on, okay?
[2:43:58.240 --> 2:44:05.240]  But the thing that I think that you're losing focus on is that the people are seeing a bigger picture
[2:44:05.240 --> 2:44:08.240]  just than Hardin's financial dramas.
[2:44:08.240 --> 2:44:09.240]  The idea is this.
[2:44:09.240 --> 2:44:10.240]  The idea is this.
[2:44:10.240 --> 2:44:11.240]  Let me finish.
[2:44:11.240 --> 2:44:15.240]  Let me address two topics that you brought to me.
[2:44:15.240 --> 2:44:20.240]  Number one is the section of our Constitution that Alex read to you.
[2:44:20.240 --> 2:44:26.240]  The context that that was brought up in is how are you going to staff a detention facility
[2:44:26.240 --> 2:44:28.240]  and do it within the Constitution?
[2:44:28.240 --> 2:44:33.240]  What we do is we do it legally. We hire local people.
[2:44:33.240 --> 2:44:37.240]  We train them to the level required by the state of Montana,
[2:44:37.240 --> 2:44:44.240]  and the state of Montana has stringent certification requirements for detention officers.
[2:44:44.240 --> 2:44:46.240]  Let me do that.
[2:44:46.240 --> 2:44:49.240]  Hold on. Steve, Steve, I want to throw it back to you.
[2:44:49.240 --> 2:44:53.240]  We're going to break here in about four minutes, and we want to get the term finished here,
[2:44:53.240 --> 2:44:56.240]  but I want to go ahead and just give you the floor till we go out to break.
[2:44:56.240 --> 2:45:00.240]  Then later in the, well, I guess the show is, is, is, is,
[2:45:00.240 --> 2:45:03.240]  got about an hour and 10 minutes left, correct?
[2:45:03.240 --> 2:45:04.240]  Correct.
[2:45:04.240 --> 2:45:05.240]  Guys at the network.
[2:45:05.240 --> 2:45:06.240]  Yes, sir.
[2:45:06.240 --> 2:45:12.240]  Okay, good. Steve, I just want to give her the last word and throw it to you in this segment
[2:45:12.240 --> 2:45:15.240]  and the next for the other breaking news you have,
[2:45:15.240 --> 2:45:18.240]  but I want to give Becky, just as we go to break here, about two minutes,
[2:45:18.240 --> 2:45:20.240]  then you throw it to break in the last two minutes.
[2:45:20.240 --> 2:45:21.240]  Come back with Steve Cuell, okay, Steve?
[2:45:21.240 --> 2:45:22.240]  That's fine.
[2:45:22.240 --> 2:45:23.240]  Okay, here's Becky.
[2:45:23.240 --> 2:45:26.240]  Becky, a final comment, because we're about to go to break.
[2:45:26.240 --> 2:45:30.240]  Steve, my only comment at this point is that I want to thank you and Alex
[2:45:30.240 --> 2:45:34.240]  and all of your listeners for giving me an opportunity to talk today.
[2:45:34.240 --> 2:45:39.240]  As I said in local media all day, my, my focus is on the people of Hardin,
[2:45:39.240 --> 2:45:41.240]  and some of them are gathered around me now.
[2:45:41.240 --> 2:45:45.240]  I'm going to be outside now because I'm going to change the tour of the property here,
[2:45:45.240 --> 2:45:49.240]  so I'm going to say goodbye to you and your viewers or your listeners.
[2:45:49.240 --> 2:45:55.240]  Steve, you and I had a little plan to meet and have me be on your show.
[2:45:55.240 --> 2:45:59.240]  You kind of got a little bit usurped by Alex there,
[2:45:59.240 --> 2:46:02.240]  so let's you and I do another show together, okay?
[2:46:02.240 --> 2:46:04.240]  Sure, but again, I want to make it clear.
[2:46:04.240 --> 2:46:09.240]  Steve, I want to get your comment and I'm going to get off the phone
[2:46:09.240 --> 2:46:11.240]  and come back in the next segment.
[2:46:11.240 --> 2:46:14.240]  I just want to point out that all these people running this are foreigners.
[2:46:14.240 --> 2:46:18.240]  They have to hire a local to be their front person because they're all foreigners.
[2:46:18.240 --> 2:46:25.240]  Right, and Alex, the main issue is that the Hardin city limits versus the reservation.
[2:46:25.240 --> 2:46:27.240]  There are different laws that apply to the reservation.
[2:46:27.240 --> 2:46:28.240]  This is on the reservation.
[2:46:28.240 --> 2:46:29.240]  This is on the reservation.
[2:46:29.240 --> 2:46:33.240]  Hardin, for those that don't know, is on the line of the state and the crow.
[2:46:33.240 --> 2:46:34.240]  That's what it says on my roadmap.
[2:46:34.240 --> 2:46:35.240]  They gave me at their car rental.
[2:46:35.240 --> 2:46:36.240]  Is that correct?
[2:46:36.240 --> 2:46:39.240]  Yes, it is, that's what I'm saying.
[2:46:39.240 --> 2:46:42.240]  And for those that will talk when we come back after the break,
[2:46:42.240 --> 2:46:45.240]  all you have to see is the parallel to the cabazon.
[2:46:45.240 --> 2:46:52.240]  For those who don't know about it, what that means is you can get away with,
[2:46:52.240 --> 2:46:57.240]  oh, let's use the word, you can get away with everything you want that's unconstitutional
[2:46:57.240 --> 2:47:01.240]  when you're doing it in a territory versus the United States.
[2:47:01.240 --> 2:47:05.240]  So there are legal questions and I believe that's what the real crux of the matter is.
[2:47:05.240 --> 2:47:07.240]  You can do things in a reservation.
[2:47:07.240 --> 2:47:12.240]  We have the Cabazon Indian Reservation, California, Inslaw, Promise Software, CIA,
[2:47:12.240 --> 2:47:15.240]  and that's where it all goes, Alex.
[2:47:15.240 --> 2:47:17.240]  I think we just dropped Alex Jones.
[2:47:17.240 --> 2:47:18.240]  We have Steve Quayle with us.
[2:47:18.240 --> 2:47:21.240]  Alex Jones on the ground in Hardin, Montana.
[2:47:21.240 --> 2:47:23.240]  This is just simply unbelievable.
[2:47:23.240 --> 2:47:30.240]  She's pretty much confirming that this is a foreign run merc service called American police force.
[2:47:30.240 --> 2:47:31.240]  How ironic.
[2:47:31.240 --> 2:47:33.240]  It is hardly American.
[2:47:33.240 --> 2:47:38.240]  It is hardly what the founding fathers stood for to bring in foreign mercenaries
[2:47:38.240 --> 2:47:41.240]  to police the American populace, Steve.
[2:47:41.240 --> 2:47:42.240]  Well, absolutely, Jason.
[2:47:42.240 --> 2:47:48.240]  I'm looking at the aliases of one man that supposedly is the head of the APF,
[2:47:48.240 --> 2:47:50.240]  and we've got at least half a dozen.
[2:47:50.240 --> 2:47:51.240]  No, I'm sorry.
[2:47:51.240 --> 2:47:52.240]  One, two.
[2:47:52.240 --> 2:47:53.240]  I'll count them off the screen.
[2:47:53.240 --> 2:47:54.240]  I'll send this to you.
[2:47:54.240 --> 2:47:57.240]  Probably eight or nine Middle Eastern aliases.
[2:47:57.240 --> 2:47:59.240]  You guys track the Pakistani tie.
[2:47:59.240 --> 2:48:01.240]  I track the Kuwaiti tie.
[2:48:01.240 --> 2:48:05.240]  The bottom line is that we're really, really dealing with...
[2:48:05.240 --> 2:48:06.240]  Can I tell you something?
[2:48:06.240 --> 2:48:07.240]  We're dealing with the surface.
[2:48:07.240 --> 2:48:09.240]  I understand the Hardin people.
[2:48:09.240 --> 2:48:10.240]  They want job.
[2:48:10.240 --> 2:48:11.240]  That place has been so depressed.
[2:48:11.240 --> 2:48:12.240]  That's not the issue.
[2:48:12.240 --> 2:48:20.240]  The issue is, is there major foreign entities that are going to be training mercs used against us
[2:48:20.240 --> 2:48:23.240]  and it's the ideal place to take people under whatever?
[2:48:23.240 --> 2:48:27.240]  Now, look, I stand by the person that sent me the information.
[2:48:27.240 --> 2:48:32.240]  They were told by a city council member that the whole situation was the forced vaccinations,
[2:48:32.240 --> 2:48:34.240]  the gun issue, et cetera.
[2:48:34.240 --> 2:48:37.240]  And when we come back, I want to address those with Alex.
[2:48:37.240 --> 2:48:38.240]  Absolutely.
[2:48:38.240 --> 2:48:40.240]  We're going to have you on for one more segment.
[2:48:40.240 --> 2:48:41.240]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[2:48:41.240 --> 2:48:48.240]  I'm Jason Bermas sitting in just an amazing amount of intel coming in from Hardin, Montana.
[2:48:48.240 --> 2:48:50.240]  Again, USA Today picking up on the story.
[2:48:50.240 --> 2:48:53.240]  The Boston Herald picking up on the story.
[2:48:53.240 --> 2:49:00.240]  It's just unbelievable to me that we now live in a country where they can hire a multiple felon,
[2:49:00.240 --> 2:49:06.240]  a multiple felon with civil suits pending against him of over a million dollars in losses.
[2:49:06.240 --> 2:49:11.240]  Somebody who has been a con man acting as though he is a car salesman, an arts dealer,
[2:49:11.240 --> 2:49:16.240]  a foreign military man, someone who advised on the war in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[2:49:16.240 --> 2:49:19.240]  And this is the guy that's going to head this up.
[2:49:19.240 --> 2:49:25.240]  And like you said, they're going to use tribal lands to train foreign mercenaries and militaries.
[2:49:25.240 --> 2:49:32.240]  This was foreshadowed this summer with National Level Exercise 09 where they went into FEMA Region 6,
[2:49:32.240 --> 2:49:34.240]  which included Montana, by the way.
[2:49:34.240 --> 2:49:41.240]  And they took over national, regional, local, and tribal governments prepping them for this situation.
[2:49:41.240 --> 2:49:42.240]  And now we have it coming.
[2:49:42.240 --> 2:49:45.240]  True fruition in front of our eyes, Steve.
[2:49:45.240 --> 2:49:51.240]  Well, and you've laid it out absolutely perfectly. The thing is, though, the timetable has now been moved up.
[2:49:51.240 --> 2:49:56.240]  And that's the thing, Jason, that I'm really concerned with because, well, Alex is on the ground in hard Montana
[2:49:56.240 --> 2:50:00.240]  having flown into buildings. All the people you see, he's meeting there.
[2:50:00.240 --> 2:50:02.240]  I mean, I'll tell you one thing that Montana's are.
[2:50:02.240 --> 2:50:06.240]  Montana's just, as they say it like they see it and they call it like it is.
[2:50:06.240 --> 2:50:10.240]  Okay? We're too rural where Alex is incredibly rural.
[2:50:10.240 --> 2:50:14.240]  The area around the prior mountains is incredibly rural.
[2:50:14.240 --> 2:50:19.240]  So when you've got hard-working Montanans, eye witnesses talking to Alex and sending me emails,
[2:50:19.240 --> 2:50:22.240]  but we're on the air together, I got to tell you something.
[2:50:22.240 --> 2:50:26.240]  This isn't Bravo Sierra. This is real-time warning.
[2:50:26.240 --> 2:50:28.240]  And here's the thing that people don't understand.
[2:50:28.240 --> 2:50:32.240]  This is how they're working across the country today.
[2:50:32.240 --> 2:50:36.240]  The powers that be that are going to put us under martial law are buying off,
[2:50:36.240 --> 2:50:40.240]  bribing, and giving bonuses, if you will, to people that tell on people.
[2:50:40.240 --> 2:50:44.240]  I mean, this is just so out of control and I might...
[2:50:44.240 --> 2:50:48.240]  And Steve, they are targeting, they are targeting economically destitute areas
[2:50:48.240 --> 2:50:51.240]  where people are willing to go along, to get along.
[2:50:51.240 --> 2:50:53.240]  Next segment coming up with Steve Quayle.
[2:50:53.240 --> 2:50:54.240]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[2:50:54.240 --> 2:50:59.240]  I'm Jason Burma sitting in the latest over at infowars.com and prisonplanet.tv.
[2:51:02.240 --> 2:51:04.240]  Remain in your houses.
[2:51:04.240 --> 2:51:10.240]  The president of the United States has declared martial law under executive order 11,004.
[2:51:10.240 --> 2:51:14.240]  Will they do it? Will they pull the trigger this time?
[2:51:14.240 --> 2:51:20.240]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[2:51:20.240 --> 2:51:22.240]  Think it can't happen here?
[2:51:22.240 --> 2:51:27.240]  Executive order 10-9-90 locks down all highways.
[2:51:27.240 --> 2:51:32.240]  Executive order 10-9-95 ceases control of all media outlets.
[2:51:32.240 --> 2:51:37.240]  Executive order 10-9-98 controls all farms and food supplies.
[2:51:37.240 --> 2:51:43.240]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[2:51:43.240 --> 2:51:46.240]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America,
[2:51:46.240 --> 2:51:51.240]  or have questions about how to survive it, go to MartialLawSurvival.com.
[2:51:51.240 --> 2:51:54.240]  That's MartialLawSurvival.com.

[2:52:01.240 --> 2:52:03.240]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[2:52:03.240 --> 2:52:07.240]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[2:52:07.240 --> 2:52:09.240]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[2:52:09.240 --> 2:52:12.240]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[2:52:12.240 --> 2:52:18.240]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.
[2:52:18.240 --> 2:52:22.240]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[2:52:22.240 --> 2:52:27.240]  In the Infowar, prisonplanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[2:52:27.240 --> 2:52:31.240]  Prisonplanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[2:52:46.240 --> 2:52:49.240]  thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much more.

[2:52:52.240 --> 2:52:54.240]  Join Prisonplanet.tv.
[2:52:54.240 --> 2:52:59.240]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value,
[2:52:59.240 --> 2:53:04.240]  what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?

[2:54:00.240 --> 2:54:14.240]  We are back. It's the Alex Jones Show. I'm Jason Burma, sitting in Alex on the ground in Hardin, Montana,
[2:54:14.240 --> 2:54:19.240]  getting the tour from Becky Shea, the front person, the spokeswoman for all of this,
[2:54:19.240 --> 2:54:23.240]  only divulging so much very nice, well-meaning lady.
[2:54:23.240 --> 2:54:28.240]  But we've got a ton of well-meaning idiots out there that are allowing this progression to occur.
[2:54:28.240 --> 2:54:32.240]  I hope that she decides it's not enough to just go along, to get along,
[2:54:32.240 --> 2:54:36.240]  and she realizes that this is a violation of the Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[2:54:36.240 --> 2:54:41.240]  This is against everything that Americans who believe in those documents stand for.
[2:54:41.240 --> 2:54:45.240]  Steve, can you just give us a quick overview of how this has developed over the last week
[2:54:45.240 --> 2:54:49.240]  and then the FBI ties you just discussed with me off air?
[2:54:49.240 --> 2:54:53.240]  Well, I think the thing that people need to understand real quickly is this has been developing
[2:54:53.240 --> 2:54:59.240]  in Hardin, Montana over the last, probably, year, primarily, and economically destitute areas,
[2:54:59.240 --> 2:55:04.240]  not just in Montana, but in other states that can be used for training of foreign mercenaries,
[2:55:04.240 --> 2:55:08.240]  and let's call them what they are, Jason. Who are these mercenaries going to be used against?
[2:55:08.240 --> 2:55:13.240]  I think this is what the big picture that's being lost, and well, is it really going in Hardin or not?
[2:55:13.240 --> 2:55:17.240]  All those of you that are sending all these emails saying, well, it's not really true or blah, blah, blah.
[2:55:17.240 --> 2:55:23.240]  What you don't understand is that the idea simply is this, to pre-position the troops
[2:55:23.240 --> 2:55:27.240]  that all of us have been warning about for years, and not only the ones that are currently
[2:55:27.240 --> 2:55:32.240]  pre-positioned throughout the country, but when the Declaration of Martial Law is declared
[2:55:32.240 --> 2:55:37.240]  either by a weapon of mass destruction over Washington, D.C., New York,
[2:55:37.240 --> 2:55:42.240]  London, where it proceeds from, or it's the biological plague generating the laboratory,
[2:55:42.240 --> 2:55:47.240]  and which, by the way, Jason, two more bioagents of world renown have just been murdered in the last two weeks,
[2:55:47.240 --> 2:55:54.240]  murdered, the idea is this, ladies and gentlemen, that we're talking about a reservation town,
[2:55:54.240 --> 2:56:00.240]  Hardin, Montana, that's been hit by incredibly, incredibly bad economics.
[2:56:00.240 --> 2:56:04.240]  We have a good idea. There was a $27 million prison built there.
[2:56:04.240 --> 2:56:07.240]  Basically, it did not meet state specifications.
[2:56:07.240 --> 2:56:18.240]  Our governor, and I think one or two of our senators were sued to be able to allow the private utilization of that prison.
[2:56:18.240 --> 2:56:24.240]  Now, isn't it interesting that the only prison that could be utilized, at least the only available prison,
[2:56:24.240 --> 2:56:31.240]  is in Hardin, Montana, which happens to be on a reservation, which fits the same category as Guantanamo Bay,
[2:56:31.240 --> 2:56:37.240]  which basically Alex brought up in the form of foreign troops in the state of Montana.
[2:56:37.240 --> 2:56:42.240]  Jason is overwhelming, okay? We've got Helena Montana, our capital,
[2:56:42.240 --> 2:56:46.240]  welcoming troops from Tajikistan. We've got the bases.
[2:56:46.240 --> 2:56:50.240]  We've got one of the biggest, the former sack bases, and we've got one of the major air force bases
[2:56:50.240 --> 2:56:55.240]  in the whole United States, Maelstrom Air Force Base, with who knows what's going on up there,
[2:56:55.240 --> 2:57:00.240]  and that's in Great Falls, and then we've got the reports of 7,000 mercenaries,
[2:57:00.240 --> 2:57:07.240]  including Blackwater, being hired to secure the Montana border against people fleeing the United States
[2:57:07.240 --> 2:57:14.240]  into Canada when it all comes down. So we've got all of this being focused right now on Hardin, Montana,
[2:57:14.240 --> 2:57:20.240]  and as Alex said, hey, you just said it too. We've got a felon who seems to be the front man,
[2:57:20.240 --> 2:57:26.240]  but when we go beyond the front men, when we go beyond the front women and we get to the heart of the matter,
[2:57:26.240 --> 2:57:33.240]  we've got the potential to have a very, very major strategic placement of foreign troops,
[2:57:33.240 --> 2:57:38.240]  mercenaries, and quite candidly, the money that it brings in is nothing.
[2:57:38.240 --> 2:57:42.240]  That's the other thing I do get a chance to ask Becky, is where does all this money come from?
[2:57:42.240 --> 2:57:47.240]  Because what we're looking at is basically very sophisticated funds.
[2:57:47.240 --> 2:57:52.240]  We're looking at a model where you basically come in and buy the population, economically distressed areas,
[2:57:52.240 --> 2:57:56.240]  and they're doing the same thing, by the way, major cities across the United States in giant warehouses.
[2:57:56.240 --> 2:58:04.240]  So we're at the point now where the timetable has been ramped and amped up. How much time do we have?
[2:58:04.240 --> 2:58:11.240]  We've got about 60 seconds in this segment. On the other side, Steve, I want you to discuss how far this goes.
[2:58:11.240 --> 2:58:17.240]  I mean, is this a federal program? We've heard Obama say we need a police force that's just as strong,
[2:58:17.240 --> 2:58:22.240]  just as well funded as the military. We've seen the youth corps being rolled out through city year.
[2:58:22.240 --> 2:58:26.240]  We've seen the economy becoming crushed as they announce a carbon tax.
[2:58:26.240 --> 2:58:31.240]  We've seen them say, no, there aren't mandatory vaccinations, but the military has mandatory vaccinations.
[2:58:31.240 --> 2:58:35.240]  And no, there's mandatory vaccinations at the school, too. We are losing this country.
[2:58:35.240 --> 2:58:38.240]  Back after this, it's the Alex Jones Show.
[2:58:38.240 --> 2:58:50.240]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[2:58:50.240 --> 2:58:57.240]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power? If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[2:58:57.240 --> 2:59:02.240]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[2:59:02.240 --> 2:59:09.240]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most. Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly,
[2:59:09.240 --> 2:59:16.240]  emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free. It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[2:59:16.240 --> 2:59:21.240]  Run some pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[2:59:21.240 --> 2:59:28.240]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[2:59:28.240 --> 2:59:38.240]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready. With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science, go to mysolarbackup.com and get off the grid today.
[2:59:38.240 --> 2:59:45.240]  That's mysolarbackup.com, or call 877-327-0365.
[2:59:45.240 --> 2:59:59.240]  Don't wait. Call today.
[3:00:15.240 --> 3:00:24.240]  Again, as Alex is on the ground at Hardin, Montana, getting a tour of this two-rivers facility, USA Today, the Boston Herald, the Associated Press,
[3:00:24.240 --> 3:00:32.240]  have all picked up on this story. This is being run, not by my words, but by the Billing Gazette and others, by a hardened criminal, a multiple felon,
[3:00:32.240 --> 3:00:43.240]  somebody who uses multiple aliases. This screams of a globalist operation, but I'm going to give it to Steve Quayle to break down how far down the rabbit hole this actually goes.
[3:00:43.240 --> 3:00:45.240]  Steve?
[3:01:13.240 --> 3:01:23.240]  Steve?
[3:01:23.240 --> 3:01:33.240]  Steve?
[3:01:33.240 --> 3:01:43.240]  Steve?
[3:01:43.240 --> 3:01:53.240]  Steve?
[3:01:53.240 --> 3:02:03.240]  Steve?
[3:02:03.240 --> 3:02:13.240]  Steve?
[3:02:13.240 --> 3:02:23.240]  Steve?
[3:02:23.240 --> 3:02:43.240]  Steve?
[3:02:43.240 --> 3:02:53.240]  Steve?
[3:02:53.240 --> 3:03:13.240]  Steve?
[3:03:13.240 --> 3:03:23.240]  Steve?
[3:03:23.240 --> 3:03:43.240]  Steve?
[3:03:43.240 --> 3:03:53.240]  Steve?
[3:03:53.240 --> 3:04:03.240]  Steve?
[3:04:03.240 --> 3:04:13.240]  Steve?
[3:04:13.240 --> 3:04:33.240]  Steve?
[3:04:33.240 --> 3:04:53.240]  Steve?
[3:04:53.240 --> 3:05:03.240]  Steve?
[3:05:03.240 --> 3:05:13.240]  Steve?
[3:05:13.240 --> 3:05:23.240]  Steve?
[3:05:23.240 --> 3:05:33.240]  Steve?
[3:05:33.240 --> 3:05:53.240]  Steve?
[3:05:53.240 --> 3:06:01.240]  Steve?
[3:06:01.240 --> 3:06:11.240]  Steve?
[3:06:11.240 --> 3:06:21.240]  Steve?
[3:06:21.240 --> 3:06:31.240]  Steve?
[3:06:31.240 --> 3:06:41.240]  Steve?
[3:06:41.240 --> 3:06:51.240]  Steve?
[3:06:51.240 --> 3:07:01.240]  Steve?
[3:07:01.240 --> 3:07:11.240]  Steve?

[3:21:59.240 --> 3:22:09.240]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[3:22:09.240 --> 3:22:21.240]  That's right. Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986. Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[3:22:21.240 --> 3:22:35.240]  The truth be told, gold and silver is outperformed paper investments, like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs. Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[3:22:35.240 --> 3:23:01.240]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237. Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments. Call 800-686-2237. Make sure that you secure your future. Call 800-686-2237. That's 1-800-686-2237.
[3:23:01.240 --> 3:23:12.240]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind? If it's Berkey water purification systems, this message is for you. Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[3:23:12.240 --> 3:23:21.240]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine fluoride and contaminants from municipal water.

[3:24:08.240 --> 3:24:26.240]  We are back. It's the Alex Jones Show. I'm Jason Burma sitting in as Alex Jones has boots on the ground in Hardin, Montana at the FEMA camp at the privatized military mercenary training center.
[3:24:26.240 --> 3:24:34.240]  That doesn't exist according to the majority of the mainstream media and talking heads out there, the people that don't want to report the truth to you.
[3:24:34.240 --> 3:24:43.240]  I got to thank one of the sponsors and then we're going to go to some of the news that I haven't hit up. Just a huge stack of news I have not been able to play out and it is unbelievable.
[3:24:43.240 --> 3:24:47.240]  We're going to go through that and we're going to go to your phone calls and then Alex coming up at the end of the show.
[3:24:47.240 --> 3:24:58.240]  MySolarBackup.com. That's MySolarBackup.com. 877-327-0365. A lot of things can cut off your electrical power, hurricane snow, ice storms and more.
[3:24:58.240 --> 3:25:10.240]  How about an 1800 watt generator powered by the sun? You can get that and much, much more over at MySolarBackup.com. 877-327-0365.
[3:25:10.240 --> 3:25:22.240]  Obviously, this is the most important story of the day, but we do have to hit on some of these mandatory vaccination stories because apparently there aren't mandatory vaccinations if you believe Lord Obama.
[3:25:22.240 --> 3:25:30.240]  However, you look at this right here. It's off of CBS News. Open letter to New York State over mandatory vaccination. That's the headline.
[3:25:30.240 --> 3:25:40.240]  You see, they are telling people you will lose your job if you don't take the shot. You will end your career. Take the squalene. Take the formaldehyde. Take the mercury.
[3:25:40.240 --> 3:25:58.240]  Meanwhile, we talked a little bit about the police state control grid. I wanted to play you a video of the upcoming Google Earth and the demonstrations on how it is going to triangulate where you go to and then use CCTV cameras to show you live video images.
[3:25:58.240 --> 3:26:07.240]  This is what's available to the public, folks. To the public. Doubt me. I don't think we're going to have time to play it on this show, but perhaps we'll play it tomorrow.
[3:26:07.240 --> 3:26:14.240]  We only have about 34 minutes and there's so much breaking news going on. We're going to post it over at PrisonPlanetandInfoWars.com.
[3:26:14.240 --> 3:26:23.240]  But that ties into this story. EU launches free satellite system to fine-tune GPS. Remember, they're always here to help. They're always here because they love you.
[3:26:23.240 --> 3:26:30.240]  No, they're not here to help. They're not here because they love you. They're here to surveil you, to put you in the control grid.
[3:26:30.240 --> 3:26:42.240]  The European Union launched a free satellite navigation network on Thursday that could help pilots, drivers, and blind people by fine-tuning the accuracy of U.S. global positioning system to around two meters.
[3:26:42.240 --> 3:26:52.240]  They are closing in. That's what this is about. Meanwhile, the push for a carbon tax and climate sustainability moves on.
[3:26:52.240 --> 3:27:04.240]  Salon.com. What's the headline? Contraception Bites Global Warming. This is about a one-child policy. This is about demonizing you for having more children.
[3:27:04.240 --> 3:27:10.240]  They're saying your carbon footprint is killing the environment. No, it's not. It's a total lie.
[3:27:10.240 --> 3:27:25.240]  Meanwhile, they've had a thousand mayors sign on to the Climate Protection Pledge. A lot of well-meaning idiots out there, folks, and I was sitting there watching Barbara Boxer grandstand yesterday on C-SPAN as I threw up in my own mouth.
[3:27:25.240 --> 3:27:41.240]  September 30, 2009, U.S. Conference of Mayors President Seattle Mayor Greg Nichols says that by Friday, a thousand mayors representing 85 million Americans will have signed the U.S. Conference of Mayors Climate Protection Agreement since it was introduced in February of 05.
[3:27:41.240 --> 3:27:57.240]  The announcement of a thousand mayoral signatory and his or her city will take place during the conference leadership meeting. This is about a push to tax you for breathing. This is about a push to tax you for having more than one car.
[3:27:57.240 --> 3:28:12.240]  This is about a push to tax you for having a large home. Total enslavement. And they're getting ready, folks. They're going into the poor areas. They're making FEMA camps and they're bringing in private mercenary forces.
[3:28:12.240 --> 3:28:22.240]  The reason I'm yelling is because it is crazy to me that no one is standing up to this. It's insanity. It's madness.
[3:28:22.240 --> 3:28:31.240]  Meanwhile, they have this well-meaning idiot, this nice PR lady, Becky Shea, who just got the biggest paycheck of her life and is defending it.
[3:28:31.240 --> 3:28:44.240]  Meanwhile, it's run by a multiple convicted felon who uses over a dozen aliases and currently has a million-dollar lawsuit in which he lost pending against him.
[3:28:44.240 --> 3:28:56.240]  Not Jason Burmes. That's the Billings Gazette. That's the Associated Press. That's USA Today. But you'll just tell me it doesn't exist. You'll laugh in my face as they point the weapons at you.
[3:28:56.240 --> 3:29:05.240]  While they speak a foreign language and tell you to comply, while you're on your knees with your hands on your head waiting for instructions, you'll say it doesn't exist.
[3:29:05.240 --> 3:29:16.240]  While they're taking your home, while they have your daughter or wife in the other room having their way with her as she screams for help and you can't do anything because you're a yellow-bellied coward.
[3:29:16.240 --> 3:29:27.240]  That's what's going down. And Alex Jones is on the ground right now, risking his well-being, risking his staff to bring this news to you because it is that important.
[3:29:27.240 --> 3:29:37.240]  It might be the story of the year. Meanwhile, mandatory vaccinations go on. They're telling the military you have to take the shot. By the way, you're going to take an anthrax shot, too. How do you like that?
[3:29:37.240 --> 3:29:45.240]  We're going to take your calls after this. Alex Jones coming up. Infowars.com, PrismPlanet.tv, Jason Burmes, subbing in for Alex.
[3:29:45.240 --> 3:29:58.240]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:16.240 --> 3:30:23.240]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases. Now what are you going to do about it?
[3:30:23.240 --> 3:30:29.240]  The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[3:30:29.240 --> 3:30:40.240]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.

[3:31:00.240 --> 3:31:10.240]  It's year after a year in production and traveling to distant lands. My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[3:31:10.240 --> 3:31:18.240]  Shocking, declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[3:31:18.240 --> 3:31:26.240]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[3:31:26.240 --> 3:31:38.240]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[3:31:38.240 --> 3:31:44.240]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism. It's an anthology of government crimes.
[3:31:44.240 --> 3:31:48.240]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[3:32:00.240 --> 3:32:06.240]  How many times have you been in a situation where having a hidden audio or video recorder would have made a difference in your life?
[3:32:06.240 --> 3:32:14.240]  In the past, owning a hidden video recorder has been expensive and too much of a bother to carry. That was then. This is now.
[3:32:14.240 --> 3:32:23.240]  Introducing Diginette spy sunglasses. These sunglasses contain a small hidden camera that will record up to 4 hours of real-time audio and video.
[3:32:23.240 --> 3:32:32.240]  The Diginette sunglasses are perfect for traffic stops, unlawful searches and seizures, town hall meetings, proving your innocence, or any other situation you'd like to record.
[3:32:32.240 --> 3:32:40.240]  And if sunglasses aren't for you, check out the DigiPen. It does the same great job as the sunglasses, but in the form of a functional pen.
[3:32:40.240 --> 3:32:48.240]  Video never lies. Watch Big Brother back. Visit diginette.net, that's D-I-G-A-N-E-T dot net.
[3:32:48.240 --> 3:33:12.240]  Or call 1-888-344-6681. 1-888-344-6681 today.
[3:33:12.240 --> 3:33:28.240]  You can run on for a long time. Run on for a long time. Run on for a long time. Sooner or later, gotta cut you down. Sooner or later, gotta cut you down.
[3:33:28.240 --> 3:33:43.240]  Or be down. We'll have a dictatorship soon in the United States and he doesn't know how right he is. This is The Times Online out of the UK. Just an extensive article about how he too was duped by Obama and he thought the change was coming.
[3:33:43.240 --> 3:33:56.240]  Well, the change is here and it's not what anybody expected and he's calling it like he sees it. We'll have a dictatorship soon in the United States and one of those steps is having privatized mercenary and military forces on the streets.
[3:33:56.240 --> 3:34:06.240]  And it's happening in Hardin, Montana as we speak. We're going to open the phone lines up. Matt, in Montana, Matt, you're on the line. Yes, sir?
[3:34:06.240 --> 3:34:12.240]  It's rough today. I'm not going to lie. This is a tough story to deal with because it is reality.
[3:34:12.240 --> 3:34:26.240]  I gotta tell you, me and a friend investigated the scene yesterday before Alex got there. I was trying to get a hold of you guys but it's really hard to get a hold of you.
[3:34:26.240 --> 3:34:46.240]  We got in and we interviewed Becky Shea and they got a lot of great footage of spot every room, a lot of good stuff like that but we were there for a few hours and we did not see... I'm just really nervous, sorry.
[3:34:46.240 --> 3:35:00.240]  We didn't see any Blackhawk helicopters or any paramilitary forces around. The only thing we saw was her SUV just come up right to us as we got into the parking lot.
[3:35:00.240 --> 3:35:04.240]  Then did it have the decals on at that point or had they taken them off?
[3:35:04.240 --> 3:35:20.240]  It was just a plain looking Black SUV and I was wondering, you know, it was Becky. She was talking to an Associated Press reporter on the phone but she managed to say, hey, you guys want to come and look at the press?
[3:35:20.240 --> 3:35:36.240]  I mean, the press, you guys look like you're media, so come on in.
[3:35:36.240 --> 3:35:51.240]  The decals that were on there and how Orwellian and what they represent. First of all, they're not Americans. This guy, Michael Hilton, not an American. He's a convicted felon with numerous aliases with ties to foreign government and mercenary agencies.
[3:35:51.240 --> 3:36:05.240]  Number two, they're not a police force. They admittedly cannot police the public there. So what is going on? They're prepping the American public. Again, just because there weren't troops there yesterday or perhaps today doesn't mean they're not going to bring them in.
[3:36:05.240 --> 3:36:15.240]  I mean, if you read the Associated Press stories, she says, yes, this will be a training facility. The only thing that she's denying is that it will be used as a Gitmo type detention center.
[3:36:15.240 --> 3:36:24.240]  So she's saying that all the prisoners that are going to be held here will be domestic. In other words, from the United States, but they don't necessarily have to be from Montana, which is also troubling.
[3:36:24.240 --> 3:36:37.240]  But what troubles me the most is who they put in charge, how this is a private operation and how they're bringing in foreign troops. Matt, I hope you post those videos over to YouTube, send them to robininfowars.com and articlesininfowars.com.
[3:36:37.240 --> 3:36:44.240]  And we will post those ASAP. I thank you for the call. Let's jump to Paul in Oregon. Paul, you're online.
[3:36:44.240 --> 3:36:58.240]  Thank you for having me on. Yes, sir. I spoke to Blackwater directly today. I wanted to point out that earlier today, the gentleman you thought spoke to Blackwater actually had corrected himself and said he spoke to APF.
[3:36:58.240 --> 3:37:14.240]  I called Blackwater myself. They adamantly deny this. Basically what they said is, the lady who answered the phone, as soon as I brought up APF in Montana, she transferred me to a lady who would not identify herself.
[3:37:14.240 --> 3:37:30.240]  I wanted to know who I was, what organization I was with, what part of the country I was from, and said that APF is illegally using Blackwater insignias and symbols, and they're thinking about taking action against them.
[3:37:30.240 --> 3:37:41.240]  So what you're telling me is that Blackwater is saying that APF is illegally using their logos and insignias, and they're trying to distance themselves from this organization?
[3:37:41.240 --> 3:37:57.240]  That is what they told me, and I want to urge people to call 252-435-2488. That is the direct number to U.S. Training Center, which is the place in North Carolina that you guys have posted in some of your articles.
[3:37:57.240 --> 3:38:11.240]  They won't identify who they are or who you're speaking with, and they'll ask a lot of questions of you, but I just encourage everyone to call there and ask questions and to find out what is really going on here.
[3:38:11.240 --> 3:38:18.240]  Absolutely. Thank you so much for the call, Paul. Let's go to Karen in Oregon. Karen, you're on the line. Yes, Karen?
[3:38:18.240 --> 3:38:35.240]  What can you hear me? Yes. What I am advocating and what my people are advocating is a national strike on the 15th of October. We've had way too many reasons to take this strike.
[3:38:35.240 --> 3:38:50.240]  Sandy says we need three things for a successful revolution. We need to be proactive, nonviolent, and massive in numbers. We're asking people to prepare themselves with food and supplies and get ready to stay home on the 15th of October.
[3:38:50.240 --> 3:39:08.240]  No shopping. No flu shots. Don't buy. Don't comply. Ask why. No shopping. No flu shots. And ask why the government is continuing to disregard our Constitution and the legal petitions of redress from Bob Schultz and the We The People Foundation.
[3:39:08.240 --> 3:39:35.240]  My website, Jason, is Karen. I'm asking for people everywhere throughout this great country to realize that by going to work, by keeping our money in the banks, we are supporting this corrupt government gone wild.
[3:39:35.240 --> 3:39:49.240]  Basically going along to get along when we do these things and we don't take action and, you know, we're willing to take a check and say, yeah, I'll be your PR spokeswoman, or we're willing to allow this prison system to occur because, yeah, we're economically destitute.
[3:39:49.240 --> 3:40:04.240]  Please go check that out. I encourage people to take action and she's right. Gandhi had the correct idea. We need to peaceably resist in large numbers and make people aware of what's truly going on. Kathy in New Orleans, Kathy, you're on the line.
[3:40:04.240 --> 3:40:18.240]  Yes, Kathy. Hello. Yes, Jason. This is Kathy from New Orleans and I'm sorry. I'm actually speaking to a minister right now. I had to excuse myself.
[3:40:18.240 --> 3:40:37.240]  I'm with Gary King with Patriot Radio New Orleans and we get to talk to Dr. Ray Malabo every single week and she, we spoke to her a couple days ago and today it's going, they're trying to have a lawsuit with the FDA.
[3:40:37.240 --> 3:40:49.240]  Well, you know what? These lawsuits and I thank you for the call, Kathy. In my mind, they don't go anywhere. All right. They don't even make people that aware other than within the Patriot network that already knows what's going on.
[3:40:49.240 --> 3:41:04.240]  I'm not saying don't try. Don't try to get your message out there. Don't try to take legal action. But we know about the mandatory vaccinations. We know the entire military, including the National Guard and Department of Defense personnel are being forced to take the inoculation.
[3:41:04.240 --> 3:41:16.240]  We know they are telling students that if they don't take the inoculation and are absent for 10 days, which will be unexcused, they will become truant. They will have to redo that grade. And in many cases, CPS will come after your kids.
[3:41:16.240 --> 3:41:22.240]  We are living under a nightmare scenario. Let's go to Michael in Massachusetts. Michael, you're on the line.
[3:41:22.240 --> 3:41:24.240]  Jason, what's up, brother?
[3:41:24.240 --> 3:41:25.240]  How you doing, sir?
[3:41:25.240 --> 3:41:29.240]  All this stuff. It's like right out of Jericho, isn't it? You see that show?
[3:41:29.240 --> 3:41:37.240]  I watched the entire thing until they cut it off abruptly during the second season where they had to wrap everything up in a nice bow in about an hour and a half.
[3:41:37.240 --> 3:41:44.240]  Seriously, but this is like an opportunity. I mean, imagine we're getting at, what was it, Ravenclaw or something like that?
[3:41:44.240 --> 3:41:54.240]  Ravenwood was the private security force that they used there. Only they made people clamor for the inoculations. The inoculations weren't bad.
[3:41:54.240 --> 3:42:02.240]  Ravenwood, which is a Blackwater parody, was protecting the inoculations and the people had to fight to get their inoculations.
[3:42:02.240 --> 3:42:09.240]  So even in a show that exposed a lot of the quote-unquote NWO agenda, there was propaganda lying throughout.
[3:42:09.240 --> 3:42:12.240]  Hey, have you guys talked to Jeremy Scahill yet?
[3:42:12.240 --> 3:42:14.240]  I'm not sure who that is.
[3:42:14.240 --> 3:42:19.240]  Jeremy Scahill is kind of like the authority on all things Blackwater.
[3:42:19.240 --> 3:42:28.240]  He was a contributor to that. The Democracy Now show a lot. And keeping in the philosophy of Webster Toplain attacking from the left,
[3:42:28.240 --> 3:42:39.240]  I think it might be a great idea for you guys to get Jeremy Scahill on. InfoWars has posted a number of his articles and he appears to be a very independent person and knows everything.
[3:42:39.240 --> 3:42:45.240]  Well, my producers are telling me that they've tried several times to get him on the program, but so far he's been uninterested.
[3:42:45.240 --> 3:42:54.240]  And unfortunately, people who are stuck in that left-right paradigm often don't want to come on the program, don't want to discuss things that they would discuss on, say, a Democracy Now,
[3:42:54.240 --> 3:43:01.240]  which I think is a great news outlet. 90% of the stuff that comes out there is great and we do cover here at infowars.com.
[3:43:01.240 --> 3:43:08.240]  So if we can get him, we will definitely try. I thank you for the call. Let's go to Stephen in Texas. Stephen, you're online.
[3:43:08.240 --> 3:43:18.240]  Yeah, hey, Jason. First of all, I wanted to say I was praying for you and I'm so glad that you made it safely out of the illegal gathering zone in Pittsburgh.
[3:43:18.240 --> 3:43:25.240]  That was pretty scary. I watched with horror all the video from that, but it doesn't surprise me.
[3:43:25.240 --> 3:43:34.240]  I wanted to say a couple things. First of all, I just talked to a good friend of mine last night. I want to comment on this Montana situation because I actually called out there.
[3:43:34.240 --> 3:43:41.240]  I wasn't able to go, but I talked to a good friend of mine last night here and he was having some problems with his electric.
[3:43:41.240 --> 3:43:47.240]  So he contacted the electric company, Entergy, and they finally got his electric on. He just bought a house.
[3:43:47.240 --> 3:43:57.240]  But they told him that they are going to be replacing the current meters they have with meters that are all GPS-compatible.
[3:43:57.240 --> 3:44:05.240]  Oh, how lovely. For their electric, so they will be able to read the electric via GPS and not have to send people out anymore.
[3:44:05.240 --> 3:44:13.240]  Well, it is the new Cashless Society control grid that they're building with RFID and biometric technology as well as GPS technology.
[3:44:13.240 --> 3:44:20.240]  And like I said, what Google Earth is about to present to people, what they just showed in a demonstration this week is unbelievable.
[3:44:20.240 --> 3:44:32.240]  You will be able to zoom in on a live area where we'll give you live CCTV camera footage of what's going on on that street, in that town, on that highway.
[3:44:32.240 --> 3:44:35.240]  It's simply unbelievable the times we're living in.
[3:44:35.240 --> 3:44:39.240]  I've seen the stuff they have on Google Earth just where you can look at a neighborhood.
[3:44:39.240 --> 3:44:48.240]  But the day that this information about what's going on in Heron City was posted on InfoWars, I think it was Monday,
[3:44:48.240 --> 3:44:53.240]  I immediately, I'm proactive, I called to the sheriff's office there.
[3:44:53.240 --> 3:44:57.240]  I also talked to City Hall. I couldn't get anyone with the counsel.
[3:44:57.240 --> 3:45:04.240]  And the woman with the sheriff's office told me the sheriff's not here, whether that's true or not. I don't know.
[3:45:04.240 --> 3:45:06.240]  He was conveniently not there.
[3:45:06.240 --> 3:45:09.240]  But I brought up to her about this.
[3:45:09.240 --> 3:45:13.240]  First, when I brought it up, I called Alex the other day. She immediately said, well, it's fake.
[3:45:13.240 --> 3:45:22.240]  I said, what? She said, yeah, it's fake. I said, ma'am, I saw the video from the newscasters with these guys with APF coming in with Herdon City Police.
[3:45:22.240 --> 3:45:26.240]  Well, they took that off the vehicles. Like that made it okay.
[3:45:26.240 --> 3:45:30.240]  And I just gave her a rundown about what this is really about.
[3:45:30.240 --> 3:45:32.240]  And she thanked me, and that was the end of that.
[3:45:32.240 --> 3:45:34.240]  Look at the guys, Steven.
[3:45:34.240 --> 3:45:39.240]  Steven, look at the guys. They're presenting themselves not only as a police force, but an American police force.
[3:45:39.240 --> 3:45:45.240]  And then you have the crest of Serbia above it, number one. Number two, we know that these are foreign mercenaries.
[3:45:45.240 --> 3:45:50.240]  And the head of this is a convicted felon with over a dozen aliases.
[3:45:50.240 --> 3:45:54.240]  You can't make this stuff up. This is straight out of a James Bond movie.
[3:45:54.240 --> 3:45:59.240]  It's unbelievable. I got to jump. I thank you for the call, Steven. Let's go to Kevin in New York.
[3:45:59.240 --> 3:46:00.240]  Kevin, you're online.
[3:46:00.240 --> 3:46:02.240]  Hey, Jason, great show today.
[3:46:02.240 --> 3:46:11.240]  I just wanted to let your listeners know that a great place to start with this whole Montana incident here is the actual architectural blueprints.
[3:46:11.240 --> 3:46:15.240]  If they put up a public bond, they should be in the public domain.
[3:46:15.240 --> 3:46:20.240]  In the bottomhand ledger, there'll be names. There'll be the engineering firm.
[3:46:20.240 --> 3:46:24.240]  It'd be a first place to pull the string in this situation.
[3:46:24.240 --> 3:46:27.240]  There'll be people have to sign this off.
[3:46:27.240 --> 3:46:33.240]  While Becky Shea is sitting there saying, yes, you did see some documents where they said foreign alien detainment,
[3:46:33.240 --> 3:46:40.240]  but then she won't reveal who the supposed contractors were before the APF came in.
[3:46:40.240 --> 3:46:49.240]  I got to jump, Kevin. I've got Alex on the line with his file intel report on the streets of hardened Montana, Alex.
[3:46:49.240 --> 3:46:57.240]  Yes, the spokesperson for American police force itself a cut out for another company. It's self another cut out to foreign Merck firms.
[3:46:57.240 --> 3:47:02.240]  That's confirmed. She's now getting very educated. There's a bunch of local media here. It's now on national news.
[3:47:02.240 --> 3:47:07.240]  And we've talked to locals. They were patrolling around here last week.
[3:47:07.240 --> 3:47:13.240]  That's all that started about a week and a half ago with the vehicles didn't break off the news until the weekend.
[3:47:13.240 --> 3:47:17.240]  They did put decals on these black Mercedes SUVs.
[3:47:17.240 --> 3:47:22.240]  They are driving around and earlier in the week, they tried to say that with a conspiracy theory and none of that was happening.
[3:47:22.240 --> 3:47:27.240]  Now they've had to admit that they were here. This type of stuff was going on.
[3:47:27.240 --> 3:47:32.240]  We've been getting followed by men in black sedans, also similar red trucks.
[3:47:32.240 --> 3:47:38.240]  Men in camouflage have been seen by us and by locals that are here all over the town.
[3:47:38.240 --> 3:47:42.240]  There's all sorts of military drills going on here.
[3:47:42.240 --> 3:47:50.240]  And again, you have Germans, you have Serbs, you have Czech Republic, you have grits, you have others here.
[3:47:50.240 --> 3:47:56.240]  They've all basically fled the facility, but they're still in the town.
[3:47:56.240 --> 3:48:04.240]  And I knew this was a big story whenever we found out that they were putting the police insignia on the side of their cars.
[3:48:04.240 --> 3:48:10.240]  What we know is happening is is two rivers basically is an authority.
[3:48:10.240 --> 3:48:16.240]  And it's quasi-public, private group, like LCRA in Central Texas, taking over the water supply, hiring our own SWAT teams.
[3:48:16.240 --> 3:48:20.240]  And what they've done is a power grab here, the other that shows.
[3:48:20.240 --> 3:48:27.240]  And the spokesman in several newscasts earlier this week and over the weekend admitted, well, we had a wish list to have them be local police.
[3:48:27.240 --> 3:48:38.240]  So imagine this, you have a paramilitary foreign secretive group run by a 14-time felon from Serbia with his bizarre father in tow with German troops.
[3:48:38.240 --> 3:48:42.240]  Very serious military types here with them.
[3:48:42.240 --> 3:48:44.240]  More reporters are now arriving.
[3:48:44.240 --> 3:48:46.240]  All of this is going on.
[3:48:46.240 --> 3:48:52.240]  You have them admitting to us that they want to put a giant paramilitary training facility for police, military, foreign mercenaries.
[3:48:52.240 --> 3:48:54.240]  You name it, that's all admitted.
[3:48:54.240 --> 3:48:56.240]  You have them wanting to expand the prison facility.
[3:48:56.240 --> 3:48:58.240]  It is huge, $27 million.
[3:48:58.240 --> 3:49:02.240]  Just, just, I've shot video on the wall of blueprints.
[3:49:02.240 --> 3:49:06.240]  Just looks like as many as 50 to 60 cells.
[3:49:06.240 --> 3:49:10.240]  They were very secretive, wouldn't let give us a tour over 90% of the facility.
[3:49:10.240 --> 3:49:15.240]  I've been around the back with a large area of acreage out there.
[3:49:15.240 --> 3:49:18.240]  People have to understand that they haven't even filed the corporate paperwork.
[3:49:18.240 --> 3:49:19.240]  That's admitted.
[3:49:19.240 --> 3:49:27.240]  The billings does that is reporting for this facility, for American police force that is anything but American that is running it.
[3:49:27.240 --> 3:49:33.240]  And now the media is in there grilling her saying, tell us who the secret group is that really owns it.
[3:49:33.240 --> 3:49:36.240]  Tell us who the secret group is that really owns it.
[3:49:36.240 --> 3:49:39.240]  Tell us who the secret group is that really owns it.
[3:49:39.240 --> 3:49:40.240]  Over and over again.
[3:49:40.240 --> 3:49:51.240]  But earlier when they thought they could sell to the public, in April they admitted that they wanted to carry out, quote, alien and enemy combatant detainment.
[3:49:51.240 --> 3:49:53.240]  It's known as Guantanamo West.
[3:49:53.240 --> 3:50:04.240]  And when I was in their offices, when I was with her, then she would say, oh, no, don't take that. We would see the blueprints saying that this is basically, is a FEMA camp.
[3:50:04.240 --> 3:50:08.240]  The locals keep asking, well, why are you taking over? Why are you moving in foreign soldiers?
[3:50:08.240 --> 3:50:11.240]  Why are you doing all this? Why are you saying it's not a FEMA camp?
[3:50:11.240 --> 3:50:16.240]  See, in April the locals said, we don't want this to be Guantanamo Bay West, as CNN called it.
[3:50:16.240 --> 3:50:20.240]  And so they said, okay, well, we're just going to put regular prisoners there, but we're not going to talk about it.
[3:50:20.240 --> 3:50:25.240]  And they keep saying everything is secret. So the fact that it's a secret is only making it get bigger and bigger and bigger.
[3:50:25.240 --> 3:50:33.240]  But this has definitely, at their minimum, been looked at as it goes site, slash FEMA site, slash Black site.
[3:50:33.240 --> 3:50:36.240]  It's overall a Black site that we know FEMA's involved with.
[3:50:36.240 --> 3:50:40.240]  And I've just seen amazing things while I've been here.
[3:50:40.240 --> 3:50:43.240]  We'll have more reports live tomorrow for everyone.
[3:50:43.240 --> 3:50:46.240]  I'm going to write all my notes down and focus my thoughts.
[3:50:46.240 --> 3:50:49.240]  I have a big report for everybody at the start of the show tomorrow.
[3:50:49.240 --> 3:50:53.240]  Jason, I appreciate you sitting in. Final segment coming up.
[3:50:53.240 --> 3:50:55.240]  We'll be back with Alex Jones in just a minute.
[3:50:55.240 --> 3:50:59.240]  The latest over at infowars.com and prisonplanet.tv.
[3:51:03.240 --> 3:51:05.240]  Remain in your houses.
[3:51:05.240 --> 3:51:11.240]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under executive order 11,004.
[3:51:11.240 --> 3:51:15.240]  Will they do it? Will they pull the trigger this time?
[3:51:15.240 --> 3:51:21.240]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[3:51:21.240 --> 3:51:23.240]  Think it can't happen here?
[3:51:23.240 --> 3:51:27.240]  Executive order 10,990 locks down all highways.
[3:51:27.240 --> 3:51:32.240]  Executive order 10,995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[3:51:32.240 --> 3:51:37.240]  Executive order 10,998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[3:51:37.240 --> 3:51:43.240]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded and waiting for the right crisis.
[3:51:43.240 --> 3:51:49.240]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America or have questions about how to survive it,
[3:51:49.240 --> 3:51:52.240]  go to martiallawsurvival.com.
[3:51:52.240 --> 3:51:54.240]  That's martiallawsurvival.com.
[3:51:54.240 --> 3:51:57.240]  Go to martiallawsurvival.com right now.
[3:51:57.240 --> 3:52:01.240]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[3:52:01.240 --> 3:52:07.240]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:52:07.240 --> 3:52:15.240]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[3:52:15.240 --> 3:52:21.240]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[3:52:21.240 --> 3:52:23.240]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[3:52:23.240 --> 3:52:26.240]  Yeah, fudged since day one in this election.
[3:52:26.240 --> 3:52:36.240]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs,
[3:52:36.240 --> 3:52:38.240]  that's fascism.
[3:52:38.240 --> 3:52:39.240]  It's not about left or right.
[3:52:39.240 --> 3:52:41.240]  It's about a one-world government.
[3:52:41.240 --> 3:52:48.240]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[3:52:48.240 --> 3:52:56.240]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:52:56.240 --> 3:53:00.240]  The Obama deception. The people strike back.
[3:53:00.240 --> 3:53:07.240]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years,
[3:53:07.240 --> 3:53:12.240]  and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[3:53:12.240 --> 3:53:16.240]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them.
[3:53:16.240 --> 3:53:18.240]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[3:53:18.240 --> 3:53:24.240]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[3:53:24.240 --> 3:53:32.240]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients
[3:53:32.240 --> 3:53:34.240]  so the body will heal itself.
[3:53:34.240 --> 3:53:40.240]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[3:53:40.240 --> 3:53:44.240]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[3:53:44.240 --> 3:53:46.240]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[3:53:46.240 --> 3:53:49.240]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[3:53:49.240 --> 3:53:57.240]  Heart and Body Extract gets results. To order your two-month supply, call now toll-free at 866-295-5305.

[3:54:25.240 --> 3:54:30.240]  We have no idea where they got this information, but there is absolutely no validity to these articles.
[3:54:30.240 --> 3:54:33.240]  There is no fence or gate being built around Heart and Body Extract.
[3:54:33.240 --> 3:54:40.240]  People are not being put in jail for refusing the swine flu shot, and our city is not being taken over by a private police agency.
[3:54:40.240 --> 3:54:49.240]  Yet they have American police force on the side of their cars that she admitted that they are going to be training foreign mercenaries.
[3:54:49.240 --> 3:54:55.240]  The person that they have put in charge, according to the Billings Gazette and now the Associated Press and now USA Today,
[3:54:55.240 --> 3:55:05.240]  these are mainline sources, folks, is a multiple felon with multiple aliases who has lost civil suits in which he owes over a million dollars.
[3:55:05.240 --> 3:55:16.240]  And he is posed as a car salesman, as an entrepreneur, as an arts dealer, as a restaurant owner, as somebody who advised on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[3:55:16.240 --> 3:55:21.240]  This Hilton character, or whatever his name is, is bad news brown.
[3:55:21.240 --> 3:55:24.240]  They are abysserating the country.
[3:55:24.240 --> 3:55:31.240]  That's what this is about, and now they are attacking on the actual website of the prison.
[3:55:31.240 --> 3:55:39.240]  Remember this prison put into place in 2007 under the Bush administration, and the agenda continues through the Obama administration.
[3:55:39.240 --> 3:55:43.240]  If you missed any of the programs today, so much hard-hitting info.
[3:55:43.240 --> 3:55:48.240]  If you missed any of the four hours, you need the podcast immediately. You need to listen to the rebroadcast.
[3:55:48.240 --> 3:55:56.240]  You need to hear, out of Becky Shea's own mouth, how she doesn't want to discuss who is actually running this operation,
[3:55:56.240 --> 3:56:03.240]  and how she refuses to discuss the people that were running the operation prior to the secret organization who's running the operation now,
[3:56:03.240 --> 3:56:06.240]  and how they want to make this Guantanamo West.
[3:56:06.240 --> 3:56:15.240]  She just outright denies it, but then says, oh yeah, that paperwork was there about detaining illegal aliens from foreign groups.
[3:56:15.240 --> 3:56:18.240]  What's going on here? We've lost the country, folks.
[3:56:18.240 --> 3:56:25.240]  We continue to lose it with every breath we take, with every denial we put out there, with all the willful ignorance,
[3:56:25.240 --> 3:56:30.240]  and the shopping, and the iPhones, and oh, the angels are in the playoffs.
[3:56:30.240 --> 3:56:33.240]  Who cares? Who cares about sports at this point?
[3:56:33.240 --> 3:56:38.240]  This is our country we're talking about. If you still want to get boxed seats to that game next season,
[3:56:38.240 --> 3:56:43.240]  maybe you should step up to the plate and see what's going on in your own country.
[3:56:43.240 --> 3:56:48.240]  Remember, the headline over at PrismPlanet.tv right now on PrismPlanet.com is exposed,
[3:56:48.240 --> 3:56:52.240]  American police force is a black water front group.
[3:56:52.240 --> 3:56:58.240]  Please get the articles. Circulate them to your friends, your family, your neighbors.
[3:56:58.240 --> 3:57:02.240]  Save humanity. You have incredible power within you.
[3:57:02.240 --> 3:57:07.240]  We have so many people on the ground now in Hardin, Montana reporting the truth.
[3:57:07.240 --> 3:57:15.240]  Michael Hollingsworth, we can't commend him enough for coming on yesterday and today a man with great military experience
[3:57:15.240 --> 3:57:19.240]  and expertise who is looking at this and knows what it is.
[3:57:19.240 --> 3:57:24.240]  It is a foreign globalist takeover. It is the end of America.
[3:57:24.240 --> 3:57:28.240]  When we praise China in this country, we better look out.
[3:57:28.240 --> 3:57:31.240]  What are our morals? What are our values? What do we stand for?
[3:57:31.240 --> 3:57:37.240]  What do we truly believe in? Do we believe in standing up to tyranny to speaking the truth?
[3:57:37.240 --> 3:57:43.240]  Or are we just going to regurgitate what the mainstream media and political figures tell us is happening?
[3:57:43.240 --> 3:57:47.240]  Are we going to bow down to our globalist masters?
[3:57:47.240 --> 3:57:51.240]  Are we going to step up to the plate and say no?
[3:57:51.240 --> 3:57:58.240]  We still have some semblance of the First Amendment left. I'm going to make my voice heard.
[3:57:58.240 --> 3:58:02.240]  All this and more over at infowars.com and prisonplanet.tv.
[3:58:02.240 --> 3:58:10.240]  Again, Alex Jones in Montana as we speak, he will be reporting live, live from Hardin, Montana tomorrow.
[3:58:10.240 --> 3:58:14.240]  Folks, now is the time to step up to the plate and swing the bat.
[3:58:14.240 --> 3:58:19.240]  It's time to say no more tyranny.
[3:58:19.240 --> 3:58:21.240]  I'm Jason Burma sitting here for Alex Jones.
[3:58:21.240 --> 3:58:25.240]  Again, get the podcast. Listen to the rebroadcast. So much important information.
[3:58:25.240 --> 3:58:29.240]  God bless you all.
[3:58:55.240 --> 3:58:58.240]  This is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[3:58:58.240 --> 3:59:03.240]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[3:59:03.240 --> 3:59:07.240]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[3:59:07.240 --> 3:59:13.240]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[3:59:13.240 --> 3:59:17.240]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[3:59:17.240 --> 3:59:22.240]  Run some pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[3:59:22.240 --> 3:59:28.240]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[3:59:28.240 --> 3:59:31.240]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[3:59:31.240 --> 3:59:38.240]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science, go to mysolarbackup.com and get off the grid today.
[3:59:38.240 --> 3:59:45.240]  That's mysolarbackup.com, or call 877-327-0365.
[3:59:45.240 --> 3:59:49.240]  877-327-0365.
