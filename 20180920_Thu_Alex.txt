[00:00.000 --> 00:18.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well
[00:18.480 --> 00:30.600]  so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's alex jones there are a
[00:30.600 --> 00:36.420]  few stories that get my heart racing but this is one of them I began to hear
[00:36.420 --> 00:39.840]  rumors about this a few days ago that investigators were trying to find her
[00:39.840 --> 00:45.320]  high school annuals also some of her college documents and that they had all
[00:45.320 --> 00:54.920]  been expunged well researchers as of yesterday discovered a cash of the five
[00:54.920 --> 00:58.440]  year books that she was in because she was already in high school parties when
[00:58.440 --> 01:07.400]  she was a eighth grader and they have found a cash of these documents and they
[01:07.400 --> 01:14.120]  are to say the least absolutely over-the-top insane now who am I
[01:14.120 --> 01:18.840]  talking about I am talking about ladies and gentlemen the accuser of
[01:18.840 --> 01:26.120]  Kavanaugh Christine blazey Ford and when we come back from this first break I'm
[01:26.120 --> 01:34.240]  in a launch into all of it straight away here today but first I want you to
[01:34.240 --> 01:38.840]  just understand who you're dealing with and why these globalists are so
[01:38.840 --> 01:44.880]  dangerous and so we're gonna go out to break with a little piece that we put
[01:44.880 --> 01:50.720]  to with Rob zombie music with Walter Cronkite pledging himself to Lucifer so
[01:50.720 --> 01:55.000]  that folks can just get an idea about the mindset of deception that these
[01:55.000 --> 02:01.680]  people are in but we have her as a leader in these wild parties and in the
[02:01.680 --> 02:07.760]  yearbook spreading her legs and we have incredible statements of racism black
[02:07.760 --> 02:11.960]  face we have the girls in the school the young ladies dressed up in playboy
[02:11.960 --> 02:19.040]  bunny outfits playmate bunny outfits this is a super rich wasp school public
[02:19.040 --> 02:24.680]  school and so this is the type of garbage that you're gonna end up seeing and
[02:24.680 --> 02:28.760]  so we were told about the heavy and others that she was this little darling
[02:28.760 --> 02:32.120]  baby girl that this big mean Kavanaugh came and did this then she said the
[02:32.120 --> 02:34.880]  eyewitness that witnesses had never happened and now she's saying she won't
[02:34.880 --> 02:38.560]  testify yeah cuz they know this is all about to come out guess what it did just
[02:38.560 --> 02:44.520]  come out at info wars calm but first this we are in process of developing a
[02:44.520 --> 02:52.800]  whole series of techniques which will enable the controlling oligarchy to get
[02:52.800 --> 03:00.680]  people actually to love their servitude people can be made to enjoy a state of
[03:00.680 --> 03:07.280]  affairs which by any decent standard they ought not to enjoy I have to a better
[03:07.280 --> 03:15.840]  start from the beginning I have to a better start from the beginning
[03:16.840 --> 03:24.600]  I have to a better start from the beginning too many kids are what's
[03:24.600 --> 03:28.800]  making planet worse a lot of these kids come from bad gene pools they don't have
[03:28.800 --> 03:32.280]  stable parents making good decisions
[03:32.280 --> 03:37.760]  mercury containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies
[03:37.760 --> 03:41.800]  in the journal pediatric these new studies suggest that the opposite that
[03:41.800 --> 03:45.120]  the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and
[03:45.120 --> 03:49.560]  mental performance fluoride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay but could
[03:49.560 --> 03:54.520]  it also cause cancer for example the government had the right under US law to
[03:54.520 --> 03:58.520]  conduct secret testing on the American public under a specific condition and
[03:58.520 --> 04:03.480]  have to work with dark side we will spend time in the shadows any attempt to
[04:03.480 --> 04:08.600]  achieve world order must be the work of the devil will join me and I'm glad to
[04:08.600 --> 04:15.600]  sit here at the right hand to see it's a need for a new world order someday in the
[04:15.600 --> 04:32.720]  next few years a solution will emerge
[04:45.600 --> 05:04.600]  we knew it was coming the whole thing was for me leg first demonize info wars
[05:04.600 --> 05:09.760]  lie about us build a straw man then sue us to add credibility to that then have
[05:09.760 --> 05:13.520]  a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like
[05:13.520 --> 05:19.160]  bullying children and Islamophobia and then wallah two weeks later ban info

[06:33.640 --> 06:38.000]  the court back into the hands of at least pro-america individuals and not
[06:38.000 --> 06:43.280]  the hands of the globalist this is a critical time for the world not just
[06:43.280 --> 06:49.040]  America it is Thursday the 20th day of September 2018 I'm your host Alex Jones
[06:49.040 --> 06:56.600]  and we have game changing news that just broke at info wars dot com that is as
[06:56.600 --> 07:01.720]  big as Hillary Clinton falling down at the 9-11 site when they claim that she
[07:01.720 --> 07:05.760]  wasn't having health problems it's as big as the spirit cooking wiki leaks
[07:05.760 --> 07:10.560]  documents coming out with John Podesta and the Clintons and others involved in
[07:10.560 --> 07:15.960]  Alistair Crowley rituals and all of that bombshell information this is just as
[07:15.960 --> 07:26.280]  insane and as just as important ladies and gentlemen bombshell Kavanaugh accusers
[07:26.280 --> 07:33.000]  salacious high school yearbook scrubbed and it goes from there my friends
[07:33.000 --> 07:39.320]  Christine Blasey Ford yearbook described wild sex parties blackouts erotic male
[07:39.320 --> 07:46.760]  dancers adult Chippendale style dancers in gold g-strings dancing in front of the
[07:46.760 --> 07:52.040]  young girls dressed at high school parties as playgirl playmates playboy
[07:52.040 --> 07:54.640]  playmates
[07:56.680 --> 08:02.520]  talking about Hitler dressing up in blackface photos in the yearbook of
[08:02.520 --> 08:11.840]  Christine Blasey Ford spreading her legs describing her as a leader of these
[08:11.840 --> 08:22.720]  parties she shows up in the yearbook as a eighth grader she's in not one not two
[08:22.720 --> 08:30.080]  not three not four but five high school yearbooks now people are saying I've
[08:30.080 --> 08:34.440]  never heard of high schools where you've got girls spreading their legs when
[08:34.440 --> 08:38.640]  they're juniors and talking about running out in the highways and getting
[08:38.640 --> 08:41.360]  adult men to almost run over them so they could pick them up and take them
[08:41.360 --> 08:48.040]  into their beach houses or describing blackface and talking about you know
[08:48.040 --> 08:52.560]  Hitler stuff that have Kavanaugh ever did one of these things he wouldn't get
[08:52.560 --> 08:56.360]  nominated there's no history of him doing it and now we know why on the 17th of
[08:56.360 --> 09:01.480]  this month they expunged all of these yearbooks but someone found copies that
[09:01.480 --> 09:04.920]  had previously been uploaded that had been blacked out so let me explain
[09:04.920 --> 09:09.640]  something we need an investigation into what's been blacked out we need to know
[09:09.640 --> 09:16.840]  why these were blacked out we need to know who was involved in all of this and
[09:16.840 --> 09:20.720]  we need to have Kavanaugh even though she's saying she's not gonna probably
[09:20.720 --> 09:26.160]  testify now I wonder why we need judge Kavanaugh still testify next week and to
[09:26.160 --> 09:33.600]  have big blown up poster boards with Christine Blossy Ford spreading her
[09:33.600 --> 09:39.640]  legs in the high school yearbooks giant tables full of whiskey and beer the
[09:39.640 --> 09:44.200]  girls dressed up like playmate girls in bunny rabbit outfits and his French
[09:44.200 --> 09:48.040]  maids you imagine opening up the high school yearbook and your daughter is in
[09:48.040 --> 09:54.720]  French made outfits and short skirts and bunny rabbit ears spreading her legs
[09:54.720 --> 10:00.240]  but this is one of the richest areas in the country and I grew up in the
[10:00.240 --> 10:04.320]  richest area of Texas at the time we were not that wealthy and it was
[10:04.320 --> 10:11.280]  somewhat like this not as bad in the yearbook but it was like this I can tell
[10:11.280 --> 10:15.240]  you I've talked about it so I go over to blue collar friends houses and stuff
[10:15.240 --> 10:17.680]  you know other parts of Dallas when they're playing baseball and going fishing
[10:17.680 --> 10:21.840]  going to church going to the flea market you know and going shooting guns and
[10:21.840 --> 10:26.880]  hunting but the rich areas it was all the same type of just drunken sex
[10:26.880 --> 10:30.960]  behavior had a little devil worship on top here in their drug use you name it
[10:30.960 --> 10:37.880]  and that's what she got so she expunged that's
[10:37.880 --> 10:43.400]  Kavanaugh's accuser her Stanford profile all over social media profiles six
[10:43.400 --> 10:47.960]  weeks ago within days of him being announced then Diane Feinstein begins
[10:47.960 --> 10:53.120]  handling her she's even in the San Francisco Chronicle July 29th saying we
[10:53.120 --> 10:56.840]  have a memo we have a dossier on Kavanaugh we'll be bringing out in due
[10:56.840 --> 11:00.600]  time so they sat on it knowing that there were holes in it knowing it was a
[11:00.600 --> 11:06.600]  bunch of bull hoping to launch it right before a week before so that they
[11:06.600 --> 11:10.840]  wouldn't have time to burrow into it and investigate it well that went over like
[11:10.840 --> 11:17.240]  a lead balloon and his word of the high school annuals being discovered and its
[11:17.240 --> 11:23.760]  journalists started making calls to Feinstein's office and to the lawyer for
[11:23.760 --> 11:31.720]  Christine Blasey Ford suddenly in the last 48 hours I may not testify I want
[11:31.720 --> 11:35.920]  an FBI investigation which of course then he wouldn't get confirmed it would
[11:35.920 --> 11:41.120]  take six months won't have a new special counsel for that matter a power
[11:41.120 --> 11:47.640]  under themselves on this witch hunt so now she's saying I'm not gonna testify
[11:47.640 --> 11:52.280]  and you've got Senator Grassley another saying if you don't agree by Friday to
[11:52.280 --> 11:55.080]  when you're gonna testify next week we're going to vote and we're going to
[11:55.080 --> 11:59.840]  approve Kavanaugh you got to go further than that you got to stop just wiping
[11:59.840 --> 12:04.160]  your brow and man that was made up glad that's over we've got to have hearings
[12:04.160 --> 12:08.360]  now let the Democrats be shameless let him whatever just put up big old blowups
[12:08.360 --> 12:16.800]  on poster board of the high school annual of Christine Blasey Ford with her
[12:16.800 --> 12:21.440]  in stockings up to her knees in many skirts provocatively putting her hand
[12:21.440 --> 12:26.720]  behind her head and showing everything but her panties if you're watching on
[12:26.720 --> 12:30.320]  TV you can see it and there's there's more photos of the girls dressed up in
[12:30.320 --> 12:37.520]  playmate outfits it's all there it's all there and the drunkenness and the black
[12:37.520 --> 12:45.560]  face and the the Hitler jokes and just all of it is sick oh but the key the real
[12:45.560 --> 12:49.960]  impeachment here of her credibility is that she said she remembered this but
[12:49.960 --> 12:53.960]  they were quote falling down drunk and the eyewitness she said that saved her
[12:53.960 --> 12:57.160]  says it never happened boom you're done right there you're supposed to have a
[12:57.160 --> 13:02.240]  witness your one witness says you're a liar says you're wrong bare minimum now
[13:02.240 --> 13:08.600]  that all through these five annuals and we're getting more of these we've gotten
[13:08.600 --> 13:13.920]  ahold of more of these it talks about the culture of falling down drunkness and
[13:13.920 --> 13:17.560]  how great it is to be able to deny what happened the night before and she is
[13:17.560 --> 13:23.320]  quoted in there and there are quotes about Chrissy as they call her Chrissy
[13:23.320 --> 13:28.280]  is what Christine went by they make sure photos ever how Chrissy was one of the
[13:28.280 --> 13:32.960]  wildest and how much Chrissy loved having fun and how much Chrissy loved
[13:32.960 --> 13:37.040]  passing out and how Chrissy couldn't remember anything and that was good
[13:37.040 --> 13:41.000]  because then she would have plausible nobility there's Chrissy on screen for
[13:41.000 --> 13:48.040]  TV viewers spreading her legs in a classic Betty Page post guys can we get
[13:48.040 --> 13:51.680]  the photo of her and put it next to Betty Page or Marilyn Monroe that is a
[13:51.680 --> 13:58.560]  classic I'm ready for you baby I walk into my bedroom at night and my wife's
[13:58.560 --> 14:04.240]  sitting there on the bed like that it doesn't mean we're watching Netflix okay
[14:04.240 --> 14:07.160]  in fact I walk to the bathroom this morning my wife walks out of the shower
[14:07.160 --> 14:10.760]  and did that exact pose I was like now I'm a lucky man I'm just saying red blood
[14:10.760 --> 14:17.360]  of America that means I want you to climb on top of me right now so when she
[14:17.360 --> 14:26.160]  was a junior she's in the yearbook in a Betty Page climb on top of me post this
[14:26.160 --> 14:29.360]  poor little baby but print me the heavy article that's actually linked in one of
[14:29.360 --> 14:32.880]  these because it was an article covering her last week when oh she was this
[14:32.880 --> 14:36.400]  little shrinking violet little sweet see girl they show a picture of her from
[14:36.400 --> 14:41.200]  like sixth grade and she was such no no there she is in high school a woman and
[14:41.200 --> 14:48.280]  look we're not faulting her that she appears to be a hussy Betty Page we are
[14:48.280 --> 14:54.160]  not faulting her that's okay God made her that way Lord knows I've been a dirty
[14:54.160 --> 15:03.480]  fox myself the point is is that this woman is the definition of a train wreck
[15:03.480 --> 15:08.080]  fraud in my humble view and opinion but look at all the evidence so here's the
[15:08.080 --> 15:12.640]  deal totally impeached that she talks about it as it parties where they
[15:12.640 --> 15:19.360]  celebrate drunkenness until alcoholic amnesia and so no one remembers anything
[15:19.360 --> 15:25.360]  how the hell do you remember 36 years later what happened at a drunken party
[15:25.360 --> 15:31.800]  when I can assure you drunken parties I was at 30 years ago I don't remember
[15:31.800 --> 15:38.000]  any of it but you remember everything don't you because she's a democratic party
[15:38.000 --> 15:42.040]  operative who gave 10 times to Hillary we know of 60 times the Democrats and who
[15:42.040 --> 15:45.680]  works for big abortion companies on and on on her students say she's a bully she
[15:45.680 --> 15:50.480]  fixed the total MO but forget that now she says she won't testify now she's
[15:50.480 --> 15:54.880]  pulling back they need to go ahead with testimony and show all this to the world
[15:54.880 --> 15:58.400]  all of it

[20:41.880 --> 20:46.840]  it looks so promising they were gonna be able to bring down judge Kavanaugh
[20:46.840 --> 20:52.600]  with his incredible record and then a woman within days of him being
[20:52.600 --> 20:58.240]  nominated calls diane feinstein and tells her I remember at a party 36 years
[20:58.240 --> 21:02.400]  ago he came in and jumped on top me for 10 seconds I thought I would die they
[21:02.400 --> 21:06.440]  rolled around drunk and then his friend came in and saved us then the friend
[21:06.440 --> 21:10.320]  said that never happened then 65 women came forward saying Kavanaugh was
[21:10.320 --> 21:13.640]  nothing but a gentleman was a bookworm and that they'd never even really seen
[21:13.640 --> 21:20.280]  him drink until college and then it got worse then it became discovered that she
[21:20.280 --> 21:25.080]  exposes her social network comments social media and her Stanford postings
[21:25.080 --> 21:30.200]  and then they discovered she'd deleted or someone deleted all five annuals
[21:30.200 --> 21:34.680]  because she showed up even as an eighth grader in high school parties that the
[21:34.680 --> 21:40.560]  elite racy high school that she went to so now we have Christine Blasey Ford
[21:40.560 --> 21:47.240]  known as Chrissy in her own yearbooks as a leader in the movement the school to
[21:47.240 --> 21:54.680]  be fall down drunk and not remember what you said including adult escorts dancing
[21:54.680 --> 22:03.000]  in nothing but string bikini thongs male escorts for high school girls and her
[22:03.000 --> 22:09.360]  posing in photos provocatively like Betty Page spreading her legs in the
[22:09.360 --> 22:12.960]  yearbook which is a whole other subject about how these elites operate now their
[22:12.960 --> 22:17.880]  public schools are different and how these things are engaged in this is the
[22:17.880 --> 22:23.480]  incredible truth it was all going so well for the establishment in their
[22:23.480 --> 22:30.120]  electronic lynching of the judge Brett Kavanaugh but now it's not going so well
[22:30.120 --> 22:34.880]  here's the problem as the news of this began to percolate as reporters started
[22:34.880 --> 22:39.120]  to call people yesterday everyone's still afraid to cover it but info wars
[22:39.120 --> 22:46.320]  dot com on a big platform they got panicked and said we're not gonna
[22:46.320 --> 22:50.400]  testify now and grassy said okay if you're not going to we're gonna go ahead
[22:50.400 --> 22:55.360]  now the vote and Kavanaugh is going to be approved and so now she's like oh I
[22:55.360 --> 22:58.440]  want an FBI investigation it'll take six months a year maybe have the special
[22:58.440 --> 23:02.400]  counsel involved you know now he looks into high school parties 36 years ago
[23:02.400 --> 23:07.320]  and elite wash for areas of the East Coast even though I witnessed this say
[23:07.320 --> 23:12.520]  it didn't happen how about another big witch hunt we need to call their bluff
[23:12.520 --> 23:16.360]  and say we're having hearings now because Kavanaugh is not gonna have you
[23:16.360 --> 23:20.160]  demonize him in the news and they're not be able to respond whether you show up
[23:20.160 --> 23:26.520]  or not send your lawyer we're going to show her high school annuals we're
[23:26.520 --> 23:30.280]  gonna show her and her friends in playboy bunny outfits and we're gonna
[23:30.280 --> 23:35.520]  demand in subpoenas that you bring your high school annual because most this is
[23:35.520 --> 23:40.440]  blacked out and if you spreading your legs and women in French made outfits
[23:40.440 --> 23:45.480]  and bunny ears talking about how they run into the highways to pick up adult
[23:45.480 --> 23:49.840]  men to bring them back to their beach condos and if you're talking about black
[23:49.840 --> 23:53.640]  face and Hitler and you're talking about all of this when you're the politically
[23:53.640 --> 23:57.920]  correct Nazis who go around you know saying if somebody has blonde hair
[23:57.920 --> 24:00.600]  they're a Nazi well you're you're you're making jokes about Hitler and have
[24:00.600 --> 24:08.520]  folks in blackface by your rules you aren't fit to be a ditch digger and so
[24:08.520 --> 24:16.840]  Kavanaugh absolutely must demand to have his day now that he's been put
[24:16.840 --> 24:20.400]  through the ringer and lied about he needs to be able to clear his name and
[24:20.400 --> 24:24.240]  march in there with his witnesses and say here's her supposed witness never
[24:24.240 --> 24:27.640]  happened I've never seen any of this I was there I don't remember this party
[24:27.640 --> 24:32.600]  and now let's look at what she was doing then because you've got the heavy and
[24:32.600 --> 24:37.280]  others again there's an article linked in the cult of the first amendment that
[24:37.280 --> 24:41.320]  block spot there's a link in here to the heavy article and Paula's a link to I
[24:41.320 --> 24:45.920]  like to print that heavy article place where it described her last week as the
[24:45.920 --> 24:51.200]  ultimate angel cake I mean she was just the sweet little girl that didn't talk
[24:51.200 --> 24:55.720]  to anybody and she just was really quiet in the show I think it's a sixth grade
[24:55.720 --> 25:00.240]  photo they're now saying a sixth grade photo of her and and then this big
[25:00.240 --> 25:06.120]  Kavanaugh came in and he just broke her jaw there on the bed and of course they
[25:06.120 --> 25:10.120]  don't really say that they're implying that's what went on and then now we
[25:10.120 --> 25:18.480]  learn it's all a gigantic mega size load of baloney so Kavanaugh must
[25:18.480 --> 25:25.760]  absolutely be able to face his accuser but if she won't show up if she'll
[25:25.760 --> 25:29.320]  launch the allegation and they're not coming facing under law under Judas
[25:29.320 --> 25:32.200]  jurisprudence under the statute of limitations under everything this
[25:32.200 --> 25:37.200]  shouldn't even already be a issue but if we let her just put the lie out and
[25:37.200 --> 25:42.240]  this isn't challenged he will encourage others to continue this no you need to
[25:42.240 --> 25:47.000]  come in there and you need to face the fact that you weren't some little church
[25:47.000 --> 25:54.440]  mouse that you were a wild woman in the school annual spreading your legs and
[25:54.440 --> 25:59.040]  it was a culture of drunkenness and amnesia and sex and an insensitive
[25:59.040 --> 26:05.600]  racist waspish elite East Coast attitude but again those elites know that
[26:05.600 --> 26:09.560]  America has woken up to that behavior so they now use that to police the rest of
[26:09.560 --> 26:14.680]  us that don't live and don't act like that that's what they're doing but even
[26:14.680 --> 26:22.760]  more importantly than all of this everyone must get the articles at info
[26:22.760 --> 26:30.400]  wars dot com at info wars dot com and at news wars dot com and at prison planet
[26:30.400 --> 26:34.320]  dot com by Paul Joseph Watson and the live feed of the show that's also
[26:34.320 --> 26:38.320]  posted there and hammer it out to everyone because they're gonna try to
[26:38.320 --> 26:41.520]  block this they're gonna try to forget this they're trying to pull her out of
[26:41.520 --> 26:45.360]  the news now all of a sudden and they're trying to say okay maybe she's not
[26:45.360 --> 26:48.760]  gonna testify FBI investigation let's just go away they're probably readying
[26:48.760 --> 26:56.400]  another woman to come in and hope that we forget about this no no we have them
[26:56.400 --> 27:02.560]  we have her in this incredibly racy bizarre East Coast eyes wide shut
[27:02.560 --> 27:07.320]  elitist school or believe me if in the school annual it's talking about
[27:07.320 --> 27:11.880]  wild sex and and and alcohol parties and blacking out and grabbing adult men
[27:11.880 --> 27:15.000]  off the highway on the beach front dragging them back their condos and
[27:15.000 --> 27:18.600]  this is just a school in general and her being a leader of it and her being one
[27:18.600 --> 27:21.520]  of the wildest and her loving it and you know she's the only one in there
[27:21.520 --> 27:27.080]  spreading her legs and again this is the only part state that they didn't black
[27:27.080 --> 27:33.160]  out half of these annuals are blacked out completely blacked out whole pages
[27:33.160 --> 27:39.400]  are blacked out what in the world is going on here what type of adults have
[27:39.400 --> 27:44.440]  created an atmosphere where this type of craziness is going on well rock wall
[27:44.440 --> 27:48.840]  Texas was like this it wasn't in the annuals but it was going on let me tell
[27:48.840 --> 27:54.440]  you one level up from or one level below from this behavior sexualizing the
[27:54.440 --> 27:59.200]  young people was devil worship and I ran into it many times and it was
[27:59.200 --> 28:03.720]  institutional it was big it was bold it was not a bunch of meth heads out in the
[28:03.720 --> 28:09.120]  woods killing their dog or killing some neighbor's kid this was real deal stuff
[28:09.120 --> 28:13.240]  and I've told you about it and you're getting a look into it this woman is
[28:13.240 --> 28:17.160]  from the establishment she works for a big abortion company she works for the
[28:17.160 --> 28:22.680]  globalist she's connected to Soros she is an operative every evidence shows and
[28:22.680 --> 28:28.400]  I can't believe they thought we were so dumb that they would get away with it I
[28:28.400 --> 28:34.720]  cannot believe they thought they would get away with this and they may still get
[28:34.720 --> 28:39.880]  away with it maybe they're right if you don't get this information out but she's
[28:39.880 --> 28:43.840]  gonna be somebody now isn't she she's gonna say Kavanaugh when she was just a
[28:43.840 --> 28:47.240]  sweet little girl never been to a party never did nothing when she was a
[28:47.240 --> 28:51.440]  sophomore she walked in there and came this big mean guy meanwhile she's

[33:30.600 --> 33:36.440]  why do tech elites heavily restrict or outright ban their own children's use of
[33:36.440 --> 33:40.080]  technology bill gates as kids aren't allowed to use smartphones after a
[33:40.080 --> 33:43.880]  certain time we often set a time after which there is no screen time and in
[33:43.880 --> 33:47.520]  their case that helps them get to sleep at a reasonable hour despite being an
[33:47.520 --> 33:52.320]  actual cyborg himself I was human I am human still Mark Zuckerberg strictly
[33:52.320 --> 33:56.520]  limits his kids use of smartphones and television asked if his kids loved the
[33:56.520 --> 34:01.760]  iPad Steve Jobs responded they haven't used it we limit how much technology our
[34:01.760 --> 34:06.320]  kids can use at home Chris Anderson CEO of 3d robotics and a father of five
[34:06.320 --> 34:10.440]  said we have seen the dangers of technology firsthand I've seen it in
[34:10.440 --> 34:15.320]  myself I don't want to see that happen to my kids alex constant in opal the
[34:15.320 --> 34:19.640]  chief executive of the outcast agency restricts her kids use of gadgets to just
[34:19.640 --> 34:25.000]  30 minutes a day and bans them period for her five-year-old as Alice Thompson
[34:25.000 --> 34:29.360]  wrote it's astonishing if you think about it the more money you make out of the
[34:29.360 --> 34:34.000]  tech industry the more you appear to shield your family from its effects
[34:34.000 --> 34:38.640]  authors Joe Clement and my miles ask what is it these wealthy tech executives
[34:38.640 --> 34:43.440]  know about their own products that their consumers don't the most sought after
[34:43.440 --> 34:47.960]  private school in Silicon Valley bans electronic devices for the under-11s
[34:47.960 --> 34:52.400]  why do these people endlessly promote the wonders of technology out of one
[34:52.400 --> 34:57.000]  side of their mouths while privately keeping their own kids away from
[34:57.000 --> 35:01.440]  technology I'll tell you why because they know what they unleashed was
[35:01.440 --> 35:06.680]  designed to be addictive addictive behavior leads to depression we have an
[35:06.680 --> 35:11.360]  epidemic of childhood depression hospital admissions for suicidal teenagers
[35:11.360 --> 35:16.760]  have doubled in the last ten years 62% of undergraduate students describe
[35:16.760 --> 35:22.360]  feeling overwhelming anxiety depression rates have leapt by 63% for
[35:22.360 --> 35:28.600]  teens and 47% for millennials since 2013 the ubiquitousness and overuse of
[35:28.600 --> 35:33.240]  social media and smartphones has correlated with a surge in youth
[35:33.240 --> 35:37.960]  depression eighth graders risk for depression jumps 27% when he or she
[35:37.960 --> 35:42.320]  frequently uses social media kids who use their phones for at least three hours a
[35:42.320 --> 35:48.160]  day are much more likely to be suicidal and it all comes back to addiction I
[35:48.160 --> 35:53.680]  feel tremendous guilt it literally is a point now where I think we have created
[35:53.680 --> 35:58.400]  tools that are ripping apart the social fabric of how society works that is
[35:58.400 --> 36:02.360]  truly where we are your behaviors you don't realize it but you are being
[36:02.360 --> 36:09.000]  programmed it was unintentional but now you got to decide how much you're
[36:09.000 --> 36:12.120]  willing to give up and I'm not just talking about the dopamine hits you get
[36:12.120 --> 36:16.800]  from reading messages and notifications did you know that when you pull down on
[36:16.800 --> 36:21.840]  the screen to refresh your social media feed it was designed to mimic pulling
[36:21.840 --> 36:26.600]  down on the handle of a slot machine it was designed to exploit the same
[36:26.600 --> 36:33.560]  psychological susceptibility that makes gambling so compulsive variable rewards
[36:33.560 --> 36:37.520]  each time you're swiping down it's like a slot machine said former Google
[36:37.520 --> 36:41.400]  employee Tristan Harris you don't know what's coming next sometimes it's a
[36:41.400 --> 36:45.480]  beautiful photo sometimes it's just an ad according to Lauren Brick to the guy
[36:45.480 --> 36:49.960]  who designed the pull to refresh option even though it could be made redundant
[36:49.960 --> 36:55.320]  the feature is there to serve a psychological function to keep people
[36:55.320 --> 37:00.000]  addicted Harris also blew the whistle on another feature that was designed to
[37:00.000 --> 37:05.000]  encourage addiction those Facebook notification alerts were originally blue
[37:05.000 --> 37:09.680]  to fit in with Facebook's color scheme but designers discovered that when they
[37:09.680 --> 37:14.680]  were blue barely anyone checked them so they changed the color to red and
[37:14.680 --> 37:19.880]  everyone started checking them compulsively red is a trigger color
[37:19.880 --> 37:24.640]  Harris says that's why it's used as an alarm signal so they're literally
[37:24.640 --> 37:29.320]  causing little anxiety alarms to go off in your brain when you see these red
[37:29.320 --> 37:34.120]  icons and anxiety that can only be assuaged when you click or touch on them
[37:34.120 --> 37:38.480]  a leaked internal Facebook report revealed that Big Tech knows when teens
[37:38.480 --> 37:42.720]  are feeling at their most insecure or vulnerable they can manipulate when
[37:42.720 --> 37:46.640]  users receive likes or other notifications ensuring they arrive at a
[37:46.640 --> 37:52.320]  time when the user is in most need of attention or approval all of us a jacked
[37:52.320 --> 37:57.440]  into this system says Harris all of our minds can be hijacked our choices are
[37:57.440 --> 38:01.680]  not as free as we think they are a handful of people working at a handful
[38:01.680 --> 38:06.640]  of technology companies through their choices will steer what a billion people
[38:06.640 --> 38:11.640]  are thinking today we've also been turned into outrage addicts half of the news
[38:11.640 --> 38:16.640]  media cycle is now just stirring up or reacting to contrived Twitter outrage
[38:16.640 --> 38:20.560]  according to former Google strategist James Williams we've habituated
[38:20.560 --> 38:25.600]  ourselves into a perpetual cognitive style of outrage by internalizing the
[38:25.600 --> 38:30.200]  dynamics of the medium we're also addicted to distraction did you know
[38:30.200 --> 38:35.000]  that even the mere presence of a cell phone in your line of sight even when
[38:35.000 --> 38:40.400]  it's turned off damages cognitive capacity it's called continuous partial
[38:40.400 --> 38:44.960]  attention just by having it sit there on the desk you're damaging your
[38:44.960 --> 38:49.400]  concentration and have you noticed this even when they're not looking at it
[38:49.400 --> 38:55.040]  people have to constantly touch their phone like a junkie with an involuntary
[38:55.040 --> 39:00.000]  body spasm what's fascinating is that a lot of these techies are fully aware of
[39:00.000 --> 39:04.680]  the monster that they unleashed and are now full of remorse just in Rosenstein
[39:04.680 --> 39:09.720]  the Facebook like co-creator says the social media giant has created a
[39:09.720 --> 39:14.480]  psychologically manipulated dystopia which only cares about profit
[39:14.480 --> 39:19.600]  maximization and that it needs to be regulated like tobacco companies another
[39:19.600 --> 39:23.240]  one of the women who helped develop the Facebook like button installed a plug-in
[39:23.240 --> 39:27.160]  on her own phone so she doesn't even have to look at her own Facebook feed
[39:27.160 --> 39:33.480]  Lauren Brick turns off his own phone at 7 p.m. and regrets creating social media
[39:33.480 --> 39:37.280]  addicts I've spent many hours and weeks and months and years thinking about
[39:37.280 --> 39:41.600]  whether anything I've done has made a net positive impact on society or
[39:41.600 --> 39:46.080]  humanity at all Google and Facebook venture capitalist Robert McNamee
[39:46.080 --> 39:50.680]  says that the smartphone and social media have had horrific unintended
[39:50.680 --> 39:56.560]  consequences on society he compares social media giants to drug dealers the
[39:56.560 --> 40:01.160]  average cell phone user taps wipes and clicks are whopping two thousand six
[40:01.160 --> 40:06.280]  hundred and seventeen times a day for heavy users it's more than double that
[40:06.280 --> 40:11.320]  adding up to nearly four hours a day devoted to cell phone use and those
[40:11.320 --> 40:15.760]  numbers are over two years old so it's probably even worse now go take a walk
[40:15.760 --> 40:20.080]  in the park despite the very point of taking a walk in the park being to get
[40:20.080 --> 40:25.920]  away from technology how many people do you see buried in their cell phones at
[40:25.920 --> 40:31.200]  this point I'm seeing at least 50% of the people trapped in cyberspace even
[40:31.200 --> 40:35.440]  when they're outside people are so glued to their cell phones they're now having
[40:35.440 --> 40:40.920]  to install ground level traffic lights in some major cities forget virtual
[40:40.920 --> 40:47.040]  reality how about we return to actual reality remember that
[40:58.200 --> 41:02.960]  people at dinner on their cell phones people in movie theaters on their
[41:02.960 --> 41:08.200]  cell phones the CEO of AMC theaters said you can't tell a 22 year old to turn
[41:08.200 --> 41:12.680]  off their cell phone it's like asking them to cut off a limb there's a reason
[41:12.680 --> 41:17.160]  depression is exploding and there's a reason why tech elites keep their own
[41:17.160 --> 41:21.680]  kids away from smartphones they don't want their children to be sucked into
[41:21.680 --> 41:26.840]  this generational cycle of addiction dependency and unhappiness that

[47:25.320 --> 47:31.120]  we now take you live to the central texas commenced under and the heart of
[47:31.120 --> 47:33.920]  the resistance
[47:42.200 --> 47:47.560]  well something interesting started happening about six weeks ago the
[47:47.560 --> 47:55.680]  social media the Stanford profile everything started getting deleted very
[47:55.680 --> 48:03.240]  very very quickly from Christine Blasey Ford's records and then researchers on
[48:03.240 --> 48:08.080]  the 17th said let's go look at her high school annuals and since she been at
[48:08.080 --> 48:13.240]  parties when she was an eighth grader she was in five of them five of them and
[48:13.240 --> 48:19.200]  most of them are blacked out and she's all over the text her name at the
[48:19.200 --> 48:25.480]  parties and blacking out and being drunk and there's parties with male escorts
[48:25.480 --> 48:32.600]  only wearing golden G strings there in attendance and then there's reports of
[48:32.600 --> 48:38.520]  Hitler jokes and in the high school annual there's photos of giant piles of
[48:38.520 --> 48:42.920]  whiskey and beer because I guess the students did their own annual and this
[48:42.920 --> 48:47.120]  is something the adults signed off on so can you imagine a if the stuff in
[48:47.120 --> 48:56.000]  there is really really wild how bad it really is and then be what else did they
[48:56.000 --> 49:00.400]  really delete because you know we've got an image purportedly and it says
[49:00.400 --> 49:03.520]  there in the article that she's involved the parties and it looks just like her
[49:03.520 --> 49:09.320]  we have side by sides of the photo in the annual and the blacked out areas in
[49:09.320 --> 49:17.800]  Christine Blasey Ford maybe we can put that up on screen for TV viewers and we've
[49:17.800 --> 49:21.320]  got girls talking about running out in the highway and blocking adult men's
[49:21.320 --> 49:26.240]  cars and getting them to come in and quote pass out at a party at a house
[49:26.240 --> 49:31.040]  with them on the beach the biggest thing is they talk about once you black out
[49:31.040 --> 49:36.080]  then you don't have any guilt for what you've done and how great it is at be
[49:36.080 --> 49:41.760]  amnesiac about the night before and so she's saying and they talk about her
[49:41.760 --> 49:45.240]  being amnesiac and others being amnesiac at these parties not remembering
[49:45.240 --> 49:48.760]  what happened then how could she then say with Kavanaugh who no one can even
[49:48.760 --> 49:56.280]  prove was that one of these parties from another school 36 years ago and that
[49:56.280 --> 50:03.040]  basically brings down her entire push to have his nomination blocked oh and
[50:03.040 --> 50:07.320]  guess what magically now last night today she says I may not even testify and
[50:07.320 --> 50:12.000]  senator Grassley says you will come testify you will be part of this you
[50:12.000 --> 50:16.160]  will be there or we're gonna go ahead and confirm Kavanaugh she said oh I want an
[50:16.160 --> 50:20.160]  FBI investigation a new special counsel that has all these broad powers maybe we
[50:20.160 --> 50:23.560]  can find somebody in the Kavanaugh family that didn't pay their taxes that's
[50:23.560 --> 50:27.000]  how this works you're looking for Russia but we find taxes we're looking for a
[50:27.000 --> 50:31.760]  sex assault guy jumping on a girl 36 years ago at a drunken party and we
[50:31.760 --> 50:37.440]  find taxes or maybe Kavanaugh forget what color socks he was wearing 36 years
[50:37.440 --> 50:41.600]  ago on that day and they'll get him for lying to the FBI but don't forget they
[50:41.600 --> 50:46.160]  had all these other sickening articles Christine Blasey Ford's high school
[50:46.160 --> 50:51.080]  years five facts facts to know from the heavy about how she was this little
[50:51.080 --> 50:55.360]  sweet girl that wasn't involved in anything and she was so innocent and
[50:55.360 --> 50:59.760]  these bad things happened to her you go and you actually read the stories on
[50:59.760 --> 51:04.440]  info wars.com and news wars.com and the cult the first amendment that originally
[51:04.440 --> 51:08.560]  broke all this last night and it goes through it all Kavanaugh's accuser
[51:08.560 --> 51:12.680]  Salacious high school yearbook scrubbed why'd you scrub them why'd you scrub them
[51:12.680 --> 51:18.120]  Christine Blasey Ford's yearbook describes wild sex parties blackouts
[51:18.120 --> 51:25.160]  erotic male dancers wearing golden G strings picking up adult men taking them
[51:25.160 --> 51:30.360]  back to houses with them parties where the girls wore blackface also made fun
[51:30.360 --> 51:36.760]  of Muslims and parties where they made jokes about Hitler and that's what they
[51:36.760 --> 51:44.000]  put in the annual that the students put together so I ask you now can you believe
[51:44.000 --> 51:47.320]  anything she says when she's part of a school in a culture that she's in the
[51:47.320 --> 51:52.880]  middle of according to these articles blacking out drunk but now she says she
[51:52.880 --> 52:01.120]  remembers everything about Kavanaugh it makes one shake their head it really does
[52:01.120 --> 52:08.120]  there you have from page 145 of the school and you blow it up you look at
[52:08.120 --> 52:13.560]  in the HD the bone structure at the face the smile the hair and it describes her
[52:13.560 --> 52:19.560]  at the parties in the article but it's all blacked out there you go
[52:19.560 --> 52:29.200]  now regardless of that she's at a school in this wild culture they admit she's
[52:29.200 --> 52:32.640]  wild in the culture they admit she likes to black out in the culture you've got
[52:32.640 --> 52:37.640]  the other students dressed up in playboy bunny outfits and French made
[52:37.640 --> 52:42.240]  outfits dressing up like provocative sluts to go to these high school parties
[52:42.240 --> 52:50.200]  what would you do if you opened up your daughter's junior or senior annual school
[52:50.200 --> 52:54.840]  annual from their junior senior year even sophomore year hell freshman year
[52:54.840 --> 53:01.760]  she's at these parties as an eighth grader what would you do that one right
[53:01.760 --> 53:06.520]  there on the side looks like her to was not as clear as the other one what would
[53:06.520 --> 53:11.360]  you do and her names all over this oh Chrissy as she's called loves to get
[53:11.360 --> 53:18.280]  passed out drunk boy she was sure grant the party it was amazing you let your
[53:18.280 --> 53:22.440]  daughter dress up like a French maid and put bunny rabbit ears on and now all
[53:22.440 --> 53:30.200]  these years later Diane Feinstein was in the San Francisco Chronicle on the 29th
[53:30.200 --> 53:36.120]  of July right when Cabinon first got nominated saying we've got a memo we've
[53:36.120 --> 53:40.760]  got proof and we're gonna bring it out they have a plan to stop Cabinon and we
[53:40.760 --> 53:45.760]  now know she had this six weeks ago and sat on it because they knew it was
[53:45.760 --> 53:49.480]  unraveling and what do you do with something's unraveling when it doesn't
[53:49.480 --> 53:52.560]  make sense what's got holes in it you wait till the last minute if it's a
[53:52.560 --> 53:55.440]  bulletproof case you bring it on up front but it's not you wait till the
[53:55.440 --> 54:00.640]  11th hour 58th minute and then you slide it out but people found this
[54:00.640 --> 54:04.440]  information when they found that she'd exposed her social media she'd expose
[54:04.440 --> 54:07.840]  her Stanford profile and all this other stuff and that her Democrat activist
[54:07.840 --> 54:10.760]  background and giving to Hillary and being a political operative and being
[54:10.760 --> 54:14.280]  someone that even produces and sells designer pussy hats that's what they
[54:14.280 --> 54:17.680]  call them then the little pink purple hats the left is where and they're a
[54:17.680 --> 54:23.040]  symbol of hating men but turns out she doesn't hate men she likes the power
[54:23.040 --> 54:27.520]  over men in this information in these school annuals is accurate now these
[54:27.520 --> 54:31.280]  are forgeries I've never seen better but see there's not a response to this I
[54:31.280 --> 54:34.680]  know for days reporters have been calling people asking about this and
[54:34.680 --> 54:38.800]  that's why suddenly oh I can't testify now I just learned FBI investigation I'm
[54:38.800 --> 54:44.040]  gonna accuse Kavanaugh I'm gonna do all this I'm gonna say all this and I work
[54:44.040 --> 54:46.800]  for a big abortion company I forgot to tell you that the morning after pill and
[54:46.800 --> 54:51.800]  I'm gonna just then step back here as a political officer as a political
[54:51.800 --> 54:55.560]  operative as a public figure as a bullying professor as her students say
[54:55.560 --> 55:02.720]  as a vindictive professor and I'm gonna see what happens I think they need to
[55:02.720 --> 55:06.880]  have hearings cabin on these have hearings and they need to bring all
[55:06.880 --> 55:10.760]  this out in those hearings and they just subpoena her and make her testify you

[01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:07.520]  2010 census around 89% of Hialeah residents speak Spanish as their first
[01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:13.120]  or second language and more than 94% identify as Hispanic or Latino that's
[01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:18.040]  why the now fired Taco Bell employee who couldn't take an order in English the
[01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:22.560]  United States native tongue probably felt like she had done nothing wrong
[01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:30.720]  tell me on purpose you see this no house nobody here speak English nobody in the
[01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:39.000]  back English so you can't take my order you won't understand what I'm saying
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:56.640]  would you speak something though yeah but I want to order food no I want to
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:01:01.880]  order you're not going to tell me believe it I want to order
[01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:07.520]  call the police I'm trying to order and she telling me I can't order cuz she
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:12.040]  don't speak English who's wrong what did I do wrong
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:23.760]  the point over for fun or I'm okay but I want to order food I I'm not a cabling
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:30.760]  less that was my kid hi Hialeah Florida could be regarded as a relocated Cuba the
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:34.640]  city has the highest percentage of Cubans and Cuban Americans in the United
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:39.240]  States it is vitally important that Americans understand the level of
[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:43.880]  non-assimilation we are facing in the United States significant portions of
[01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:48.640]  our own country are becoming increasingly foreign
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:02:00.680]  once one of those threats crossed out the make it doesn't make any sense to me
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:07.920]  not making sense and this is not right I'm not talking to you she doesn't want
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:11.640]  to help me because she don't speak English but you know the menu you work
[01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:15.080]  here so you would know what I'm talking about if I say I want number six on the
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:19.360]  menu you understand what I'm saying like you just don't completely shut me out
[01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:23.720]  because you don't speak English that's not fair you understand what I'm saying
[01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:27.520]  so if I say I want another six on the menu you can put that on the computer
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:30.880]  and take my order don't tell me you can't take my order because you don't
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:41.640]  speak English that's crazy it's okay I'm gonna take down the store number I'll
[01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:46.440]  be here tomorrow what's your name Louisa Louisa okay I'll be here tomorrow
[01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:52.440]  Louisa okay as bizarre an incident as this was it isn't uncommon when our
[01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:56.520]  border continues to be overwhelmed and there are roughly 12 and a half million
[01:02:56.520 --> 01:03:01.560]  illegal aliens transforming once proud cities like Hialeah Florida into the
[01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:17.880]  third-world countries they left behind Michigan had over 10 million foreclosures
[01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:21.720]  that's a lot I mean that there's only there's in the suburban area there's
[01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:26.920]  only six million people living here just affected everybody the millions of
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:30.720]  people that were living the American life those jobs went to people at own
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:34.360]  factories and foreign countries and everybody was afraid to say recession
[01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:41.360]  depression just like they're afraid to say radical Islamic terrorists
[01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:45.240]  let's make America great again
[01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:58.920]  Chris just straight up do you think the president should right now end this
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:05.040]  policy of separating families you know I think I think you're wrong there it is
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:09.520]  a law and the law needs to be enforced regardless if we don't like what is the
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:14.800]  law which law we're going as far if you come across that river illegally you're
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:18.520]  subject to arrest and the prosecution and you will get arrested and you will
[01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:22.640]  get prosecuted we've had this situation going on for four years now and and for
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:25.960]  some reason we haven't fixed it I don't think you can necessarily blame it on a
[01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:29.480]  one administration or the other I it started under one and it's continuing
[01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:33.880]  under under another it hasn't it hasn't been fixed and and it needs to be fixed
[01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:37.240]  John bound reporting

[01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:04.000]  plow into all of this but I'm gonna spend a few minutes here first just

[01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:27.960]  thank everybody that has but we've got the best fluoride free toothpaste with

[01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:17.040]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:31.600]  It is Thursday the 20th day of September 2018 I'm Alex Jones your host we have huge breaking news
[01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:39.000]  on the Kavanaugh nomination suddenly last night his accuser began to come out
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:46.000]  and say that she didn't want to testify to Congress she wants an FBI investigation
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:50.200]  when you can't have an FBI investigation it's not a federal issue there's no
[01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:54.240]  statute of limitations but I guess they could create a new special counsel just
[01:06:54.240 --> 01:07:00.080]  outside of law and do whatever they want they've already done it why not and so
[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:06.720]  now Senator Grassley and others have said okay if you don't do that we're
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:10.840]  gonna go to the full vote on Monday you tell us by Friday when you're gonna
[01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:15.800]  testify next week you're not gonna block this you do it. Now I wonder
[01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:22.040]  why she did that I just got information from a national source very credible
[01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:34.320]  I'm not gonna name extremely credible that Christine Blasey Ford was an
[01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:43.920]  absolute crazy maniac in college and that the information that is in these
[01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:50.800]  yearbooks is as you'd expect a precursor of what was to come you have to go read
[01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:57.360]  it for yourself it's on infowars.com it's on newswars.com her high school year
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:08:03.320]  books were removed from the internet copies were then found by researchers
[01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:10.720]  but they were heavily redacted in some cases whole pages blacked out and she's
[01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:14.280]  mentioned in the very pages where a young woman appearing to be her same
[01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:19.720]  bone structure same face the scannily clad slotted out but regardless the women
[01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:25.840]  period are dressed like playboy bunnies playmates they are wearing made outfits
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:32.600]  bent over wearing bunny rabbit ears they describe male escorts coming and
[01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:40.880]  dancing in golden g-string thongs they describe dressing in blackface making
[01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:47.040]  fun of black people making Hitler jokes it is insane and all these articles on
[01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:53.720]  the racism and the sexism and the blackout culture where they say oh I
[01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:58.280]  don't remember anything oh we love it and they and they talk about
[01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:05.920]  Christine who they call Christie loving the blackout loving to have a great
[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:09.760]  time and the girls running out and blocking the beach highway and picking
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:15.640]  up adult men to take them back to their condo and how the guys blacked out oh we
[01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:19.480]  all blacked out with a bunch of guys oh we blacked out again we blacked out we
[01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:24.280]  blacked out and I guess that way younger women think it's like I'm reading in
[01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:27.320]  high school some girls like dragging you in their bedroom in a party or whatever
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:31.880]  and they like kind of lay there and I'm like I'm not doing this oh no get back
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:36.040]  on top of me anybody who grew up in the 80s I think has experienced that the
[01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:41.480]  A's were pretty wild and I guess that goes on that's a younger
[01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:45.000]  immaturity thing where the girls aggressive she wants you to be in bed
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:49.160]  with her but she wants some weird plausible deniability well I never
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:54.880]  wanted to have sex with a sack of potatoes or you know a zombie and so I
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:10:02.000]  never did that but that was the thing that went on and it's incredible and
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:06.320]  you're reading this and it's like giving me flashbacks oh we all went to this
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:11.320]  party with a bunch of college guys and we all blacked out oh yeah it's a lot of
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:15.880]  fun the next morning oh my god what we did last night was we really blacked
[01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:22.120]  out but she says she remembers Kavanaugh doing this but her eyewitness
[01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:27.400]  says none of it happened so no wonder she's pulling this back but what I've
[01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:32.680]  said is Kavanaugh cannot let this happen he can't just let him put it out
[01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:36.120]  there and then she withdraws her testimony that puts this cloud over his
[01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:41.200]  confirmation in the future he needs to march into Congress with big old blown
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:47.600]  up screenshots of what was quoted and comments about her and liking to black
[01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:50.920]  out and being drunk and the partying and how she was a party girl because this
[01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:55.800]  is her at the time she said she ran into Kavanaugh if you go to mainstream news
[01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:59.760]  just just go anywhere and type her name in it'll show her like six or seventh
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:06.440]  grade real sweet oh hey they don't show you the young wild woman in the high
[01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:14.480]  school photos so what's coming out ladies and gentlemen is more of this
[01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:27.680]  because I have sources and again getting into what happened out at Stanford that
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:34.920]  you think she was wild in high school and see that's why the Dems said ma'am
[01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:38.520]  she's willing to do it but man her stories have got a lot of holes in it
[01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:42.680]  wait till the last minute roll it out and everyone will say oh can't question a
[01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:45.720]  woman can't do this even though she's Democratic Party operative even though
[01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:48.560]  it's incredibly obvious even though she works for a big pharma company there's
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:54.360]  another big report I'm gonna be getting back to in the next segment actually
[01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:59.400]  left it in my office with her incredible ties to big pharma so that's gonna be
[01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:04.040]  coming up but first let me just do this what do you think Kavanaugh should do
[01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:10.520]  how big is this they're using this to distract from the jobless numbers claims
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:16.720]  are the lowest in 49 years for the third straight week the economy is set to be
[01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:27.400]  announced the next month to be at 4.8% growth rate it's all amazing so let's
[01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:30.680]  not be too confident as all this comes out what are they gonna pull next they
[01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:35.720]  have another woman ready and the minute that woman pops up we've got to be out
[01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:39.040]  there looking at their background who they are what they've said what they've
[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:45.000]  done to impeach them this is all as clear as the sun coming up in the morning
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.840]  but are they gonna wait till just the day before the vote so there's no way to
[01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:52.160]  check them and by then they would have already expunged everything because they
[01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:57.000]  got around to getting rid of her high school annuals only three days ago when
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:01.440]  they learned people were asking questions about what was in them and a
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:07.320]  little bird told me they are getting access and have access and are scanning
[01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:12.960]  the unredacted annuals right now and they say if you think what's not blacked
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:18.520]  out sped you're about to find out why it's blacked out and then cabin on needs
[01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:22.800]  to raise that how dare this person are racing her record when my record's not
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:26.480]  erased and I have a good record say this about me when I've never met her and
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:31.080]  now she wants to put the charge out and then not let me face my accuser that's
[01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:37.280]  wrong and that violates due process and that's a fraud then the Democrats will
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:40.960]  start learning that when they attack and tell these lies we're going to strike
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:44.960]  back and we're not going to put up with it because Feinstein admitted the San
[01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:53.200]  Francisco Chronicle over a month and a half ago on July 29th that she had been
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:57.240]  sitting on this and stewing this and getting this ready that's right out of
[01:13:57.240 --> 01:14:00.800]  the San Francisco Chronicle so here's the toll-free number to join us on this
[01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:05.560]  issue on the economy 47 days out what do you think the globalists are gonna pull
[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:11.480]  what are your concerns but it's the midterms cabin on what do you make of
[01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:22.280]  this bombshell toll-free number to join us 877-789 Alex 877-789-2539 that's 877-789
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:27.520]  Alex let's go out to break though with the president breaking it all down and
[01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:31.560]  said that they really don't do that that's not what they do and now they have
[01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:36.800]  done supposedly six background checks over the years as Judge Kavanaugh has
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:42.280]  gone beautifully up a ladder he's an incredible individual great intellect
[01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:51.520]  great judge impeccable history in every way in every way I feel so badly for him
[01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:54.720]  that he's going through this to be honest with you I feel so badly for him
[01:14:54.720 --> 01:15:00.280]  this is not a man that deserves this this should have been brought to the four
[01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:06.280]  it should have been brought up long ago and that's what you have hearings for
[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:10.000]  you don't wait till the hearing is over and then all of a sudden bring it up
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:16.400]  when Senator Feinstein sat with Judge Kavanaugh for a long period of time a
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:22.880]  long long meeting she had this letter why didn't she bring it up why didn't she
[01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:25.960]  bring it up then why didn't the Democrats bring it up then because they
[01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:30.600]  obstruct and because they resist that's the name of their campaign against me
[01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:37.520]  we they just resist and they just obstruct then frankly I think they're
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:43.560]  lousy on policy and in many ways they're lousy politicians but they're very good
[01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:50.120]  on obstruction and it's a shame because this is a great gentleman with and that's
[01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:54.320]  exactly what all of the internal Veritas documents coming out with all these
[01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:58.000]  bureaucrats and socialists and globalists in the government just saying hear
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:02.840]  that that's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked

[01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:33.680]  jones show we're 47 days out from this historic election historic is putting
[01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:38.240]  it mildly the economy's turning around in so many ways because globalism was
[01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:43.200]  designed to suppress us cabinet is such a key nominee because they want a bunch
[01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:47.040]  of leftists that will confiscate the second amendment that will overturn
[01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:51.560]  basic capitalism we see all these candidates going communist going
[01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:57.320]  socialist Kavanaugh's not perfect but he is light years better than some of the
[01:20:57.320 --> 01:21:02.680]  people he is going to be replacing that's my view but again look I'm a
[01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:07.040]  libertarian living let live type guy and you know I have a very very conservative
[01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:10.040]  lifestyle these days in my life but I was in high school and college I was
[01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:16.280]  pretty wild so I don't look at people like Kavanaugh's accuser and hate her
[01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:21.960]  because according to her school yearbooks she was quite quite the tart quite
[01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:29.680]  the at least she was behaving and acting like a piranha like slut but what
[01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:32.960]  is it about all these leftist women then that use sex as a weapon and then
[01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:36.760]  pointed to whoever they want and as a psychology professor she's got a zero
[01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:43.240]  rating you know out of stanford and her own students hated her and now she
[01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:47.120]  wants to come out make unsubstantiated unproven claims her own eyewitness says
[01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:50.760]  none of it happened it's not true now she doesn't want to testify she's wants
[01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:55.680]  to leave the lie out there and not have Kavanaugh be able to respond to it it's
[01:21:55.680 --> 01:22:05.240]  outrageous so I don't judge Christine Blasey Ford for drunken parties in
[01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:10.360]  high school and the things they describe I do blame the parents I mean adult
[01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:16.200]  male strippers with golden thongs dancing in front of 15 16 17 year old
[01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:25.080]  girls that's perverted that's sick and you've got all the you know racist talk
[01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:28.480]  we've got a Don Salazar with a big article about to go up on info wars.com
[01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:31.280]  in fact it may be up there right now we should check and it was minutes ago
[01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:37.600]  about to go up these are things that need to be looked at because this woman who
[01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:41.200]  has a bad record at college a bad record with her students and ratings a
[01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:45.080]  record of being a Hillary minion a record of being vindictive a record for
[01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:48.320]  having all these problems we're supposed to just believe her 36 years later
[01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:58.520]  have the whole corporate media embrace her and then have her not show up and
[01:22:58.520 --> 01:23:02.800]  testify because she wants an FBI investigation when there's no such thing
[01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:09.200]  here's some of the ratings right my professor zero point zero and here's
[01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:13.160]  some of those some of those ratings I've just seen you guys put them up on
[01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:19.200]  screen a lot so I figured that's what you wanted but yeah there you go oh it's
[01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:21.880]  a zero because even the reviews themselves have now been scrubbed
[01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:28.440]  completely it's it's it's simply amazing the establishment is going in and just
[01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:31.840]  censoring everywhere the censorship isn't just ending with me folks it's a
[01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:36.840]  total culture of leftist trained and prepared to murder the truth to murder
[01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:43.880]  justice she works for a big giant big pharma company and that's what she's
[01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:49.280]  doing in fact here's the article right now we posted it on info wars.com it's
[01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:55.640]  from Mike Adams at natural news.com. Cabana accuser Christine Ford exposed for
[01:23:55.640 --> 01:24:01.040]  ties to big pharma abortion filmmaker average derail Cabana is plot to
[01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:06.520]  protect abortion industry profits and I totally agree with Mike Adams analysis
[01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:11.480]  she's a huge lobbyist for it pushes for it she's written a whole bunch of papers
[01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:18.440]  trying to get it approved she's on the payroll of it and now we understand that
[01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:22.880]  they think Cabana won't support the morning after pill as you've seen the
[01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:28.040]  media they claim he won't and that's what this is really about it's cold hard
[01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:35.080]  money and population reduction isn't it always about that every time that's
[01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:40.240]  amazing so we're gonna look more at that coming up again the toll free number
[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:44.080]  to join us eight seven seven seven eight nine Alex we've got a lot of people
[01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:49.960]  that are holding here that want to talk the first person I'm gonna go to is
[01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:54.920]  Brad in Pennsylvania Brad thanks for holding you're on the air hey Alex
[01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:59.440]  thanks for taking my call and obviously great great job covering the story
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:04.520]  again it's it's always the same as you point out and most people don't get it
[01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:07.960]  unless you're paying attention but they always throw up a smokescreen like oh
[01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:12.480]  you know this in this case he supposedly groped her which I'm not you don't we
[01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:15.440]  don't know but I seriously doubt it based on everything you're thrown out
[01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:20.040]  there and it's sure 36 years later the way she now won't won't come out and
[01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:23.280]  testify she works for big pharma she loves Hillary she works for the
[01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:27.200]  Democrats we've got all these witnesses you've got her when back when she says
[01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:31.160]  she's this little sweet girl so scared meanwhile you go to the year books they
[01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:34.600]  talk about her like she was one of the biggest maniacs in the school
[01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:38.920]  stinks to hi heaven and you're exactly right I'm older than you are about 10
[01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:44.440]  years so back then the culture I mean it sounds so that that could have been my
[01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:48.440]  yearbook not personally me but I mean I know exactly what you were saying you
[01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:53.320]  know things were you know things were wild back then in certain respects so oh
[01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:56.840]  even by the late 80s if the cops caught you know you had a party with a bunch of
[01:25:56.840 --> 01:26:00.440]  beer they wouldn't really do anything and this is just what went on exactly so I
[01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:04.640]  read this but but the male strippers though for high school girls I never
[01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:10.280]  heard of that well no but they might be a bigger you know more money in that in
[01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:15.160]  that town she's from or whatever so well it's a super old for rich area she's
[01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:19.200]  definitely the latest and you're exactly right man this is totally fine
[01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:24.360]  stein cook this up with her she's a big lawyer she's working for big pharma
[01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:28.480]  against that the fact that you brought that out against the you know the
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:33.440]  abortion issue I mean it's it's this stinks to hi heaven she's she's got to
[01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:39.280]  be lying or they just cook this up well here's the bigger news why are they
[01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:42.400]  suddenly wanting to pull her testifying I think it's because all this is coming
[01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:46.600]  out and I know there's even more there yeah and you said they wiped they wiped
[01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:52.000]  her social media that's a smoking gun right there too I mean these people are
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:57.360]  crazy and and and most of us you know the conservatives we're just it we're on
[01:26:57.360 --> 01:27:02.240]  the defensive why I don't know but in the media it we're always on the defensive
[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:04.800]  let me ask you that question don't you think the hearing should go ahead and
[01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:08.200]  Kavanaugh should get his name back just because she makes the accusation doesn't
[01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:11.080]  show up at court doesn't mean you don't show up I think you're there to march in
[01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:14.760]  but big projections of her up have her classmates about how wild she was
[01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:18.800]  college people and how she's a Democrat as she works for big pharma I think we
[01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:22.920]  bring it all out I know it's a great idea but do you think that's gonna happen I
[01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:27.280]  doubt I seriously doubt that's gonna happen or nope but it's it'll be great
[01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:31.720]  to see how this plays out but it's I just it's it's cuckoo land man you know
[01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:35.360]  you deal with every day let me ask you this why do you think they brought
[01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:38.920]  somebody this shoddy out a democratic operative an abortion company
[01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:43.320]  operative somebody with this wild of a past because there's there's more about
[01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:46.840]  to come out believe me I just talked to some national folks what do you make of
[01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:51.520]  why the Democrats are this desperate is it just Trump derangement syndrome wouldn't
[01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:54.640]  know I think it's they just want to whatever they can do to block it and
[01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:57.920]  like you said they waited till the last minute I mean you're all over this Alex
[01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:01.640]  this is you're brilliant on this oh no you're right waited waited till the last
[01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:06.520]  minute you trying to block it you know that whatever they can do to stop it
[01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:10.760]  it's in they're gonna they'll probably interrupt the hearings if they go ahead
[01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:13.480]  with it they're gonna do some abortion anigans during the hearings you know
[01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:17.600]  they will oh they'll be women they're going you rape is rape rape rape when
[01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:21.680]  they're not even accusing him of rape 36 years ago there's no proof her eyewitness
[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:26.240]  says it didn't happen now she wants an FBI it's like having an FBI investigation
[01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:30.000]  of the crucifixion of Christ it's not their jurisdiction there's there's
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:35.480]  there's no area to do it cuz the statute of limitations it's clearly
[01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:38.680]  political it's done in the 11th hour it's what Trump said he was the real
[01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:46.640]  genius here why did when Diane Feinstein had Kavanaugh in the hot seat for hours
[01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:50.280]  weeks ago does she not raise this because she was sitting on it

[01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:30.080]  christie as christine was known being a leader in all of this and photos and
[01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:34.200]  articles that that mentioned her and it appeared to be her scantily clad in
[01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:42.760]  sexual provocative positions and again imagine if this was judge cavanaugh and
[01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:51.360]  one of his yearbooks why it all be over but it's her so even though this has
[01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:58.880]  been out for hours no coverage there's a gateway pun and article there's a cult
[01:34:58.880 --> 01:35:02.920]  of the first amendment block spot com article but see because we still have

[01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:37.000]  looking at all of that as well I'm gonna go to break and try to come back and
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.880]  bang out a lot of these calls so just each caller be ready with your point I'm
[01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:43.000]  gonna move on to the next person I'll never get to any of you and then we
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:48.160]  also have Laura Loomer coming on for a few segments she's broken some big
[01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:53.440]  information that deals with Congressman Keith Ellison and the fact that there
[01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:58.360]  are these allegations of sex assault and improprieties by him but instead of
[01:39:58.360 --> 01:40:04.240]  having something 36 years old we have something a year old medical reports of
[01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:09.320]  abuse so the Democrats ignore Bill Clinton they ignore Islamic raping and
[01:40:09.320 --> 01:40:15.400]  terror they ignore any real crime but what they then do is is is construct
[01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:20.160]  these pipe dreams from highly compromised democratic political operatives
[01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:24.320]  extreme professors on the payroll of big drug companies are directly threatened
[01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:30.520]  by Judge Kavanaugh being on the Supreme Court to then create a story that can
[01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:34.440]  never be confirmed nor denied and then as soon as she would actually have to
[01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:39.600]  testify she pulls back because she knows she'll be caught in the crosshairs
[01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:44.040]  and has already claimed that witnesses that saw it have later than not seen it
[01:40:44.040 --> 01:40:48.840]  so her story is beyond impeached and I just go back to this because they're
[01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:52.360]  gonna continue to try this over and over again if we get Kavanaugh in and then
[01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:56.880]  one more Supreme Court justice that will actually follow the Constitution here's
[01:40:56.880 --> 01:41:03.720]  a devastating victory against the globalist now that said my friends we
[01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:08.560]  are funded by listeners like you and if you don't buy the products George Soros
[01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:12.600]  the Democrats the globalist will be able to shut us down and time and time again

[01:44:58.120 --> 01:45:02.040]  living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is
[01:45:02.040 --> 01:45:05.320]  the real drama can be found here in leilani estates
[01:45:05.320 --> 01:45:08.840]  but a lot of us on the big island rely on rain water and we need to be
[01:45:08.840 --> 01:45:13.960]  concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal
[01:45:13.960 --> 01:45:17.240]  particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the
[01:45:17.240 --> 01:45:21.880]  water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests
[01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:27.320]  for heavy metals alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there was in fact
[01:45:27.320 --> 01:45:31.160]  unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rain water
[01:45:31.160 --> 01:45:35.000]  next we tested the water from our alexa pure gravity filter
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:38.520]  and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure
[01:45:38.520 --> 01:45:42.200]  but the pH was also restored to optimal levels
[01:45:42.200 --> 01:45:47.480]  as it turns out the filter on the alexa pure raises the pH of the water
[01:45:47.480 --> 01:45:51.640]  so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a
[01:45:51.640 --> 01:45:54.920]  rain water supply but more importantly a good
[01:45:54.920 --> 01:45:58.760]  water filtration system will purify it do you realize
[01:45:58.760 --> 01:46:02.120]  that when you spread the links from infowars.com

[01:48:15.320 --> 01:48:20.840]  of the abortion pill the propagandist for r u 486
[01:48:20.840 --> 01:48:25.080]  to send your babies to the bottom of the davie jones locker
[01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:28.520]  she sees cabinock trying to save those babies
[01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:31.640]  and now the rest is history but she's withdrawing

[01:48:48.040 --> 01:48:51.800]  victory
[01:48:51.960 --> 01:48:56.040]  all right let's go ahead and talk to benny
[01:48:56.040 --> 01:48:59.480]  benny thanks for holding her on the air from california
[01:48:59.480 --> 01:49:03.720]  hey alex good to hear from you brother and i just want to make a point about
[01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:08.120]  this whole cabinot thing i think is silly alex i'm 35 years old i can look
[01:49:08.120 --> 01:49:12.280]  back between i was 14 and 17 years old my junior
[01:49:12.280 --> 01:49:16.680]  my high school we had these things called ditching parties
[01:49:16.680 --> 01:49:21.400]  we should ditch school go to somebody's house take booze take marihuana take
[01:49:21.400 --> 01:49:25.000]  cigarettes music and have a good time these are
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:29.080]  our best our best time our best yeah hey i ditched class
[01:49:29.080 --> 01:49:31.560]  two you go to somebody's house with the parents around the
[01:49:31.560 --> 01:49:34.600]  town or you go out in the field and i've been there brother
[01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:38.600]  in fact ditching parties are the best remember we should play ditch um
[01:49:38.600 --> 01:49:43.240]  spin the bottle kissing you know here there i think nobody went with that
[01:49:43.240 --> 01:49:48.200]  mentality oh i'm gonna go right nobody has that mentality at that age i think
[01:49:48.200 --> 01:49:52.360]  it's kind of silly after 30 something years but i think it's good because even
[01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:55.720]  well i mean it's usually the teenage girls that want to play spend the bottle
[01:49:55.720 --> 01:50:02.360]  it's exactly enough fill you up i'm 100 on four with this
[01:50:02.360 --> 01:50:05.960]  and it's good because even my left leaning friends
[01:50:05.960 --> 01:50:11.240]  are starting to see so just the lunacy of the left
[01:50:11.240 --> 01:50:15.720]  like they can even believe it because we exchange stories we go way back to
[01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:19.400]  our era and try to like prepare it to what's going down
[01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:22.920]  and they feel like you know what this is getting out of hand outrageous
[01:50:22.920 --> 01:50:26.440]  it's silly well exactly and then to say 36 years ago they were drunk and he fell
[01:50:26.440 --> 01:50:29.800]  on her so that's assault and then he probably wasn't even at the party she
[01:50:29.800 --> 01:50:33.320]  just making it up and then you get her your book and looks like she was the
[01:50:33.320 --> 01:50:36.520]  captain of the sluts which you know that's great give her a
[01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:40.200]  medal whatever the point is she looks like it appears she was like the captain
[01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:43.960]  of the sluts but now she says kevin all with no proof
[01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:49.400]  groped her i mean it why do you think she's saying she may not testify now
[01:50:49.400 --> 01:50:54.360]  because they're starting to see it's not working at everything they try to do
[01:50:54.360 --> 01:50:59.080]  it backfires it crumbles we keep on winning like trump president trump
[01:50:59.080 --> 01:51:03.640]  said we're gonna continue to win that's all
[01:51:03.640 --> 01:51:07.080]  so we just gotta let this i hope you're right benny absolutely well this is
[01:51:07.080 --> 01:51:10.520]  falling apart too god bless you bitty made some red points i don't want to
[01:51:10.520 --> 01:51:15.320]  i'm not bragging about high school either but i got a text by another
[01:51:15.320 --> 01:51:18.520]  national talk show house he goes man this year book's making me miss the
[01:51:18.520 --> 01:51:22.840]  eighties but i mean nowadays like they tell
[01:51:22.840 --> 01:51:27.560]  girls and boys they can't hold hands or that nobody can hug or it's like this
[01:51:27.560 --> 01:51:29.960]  other extreme and i'm not saying it was good to have
[01:51:29.960 --> 01:51:33.800]  drunken parties in high school but now it's turning to this whole new thing
[01:51:33.800 --> 01:51:39.000]  where it's like rape and uh it's it's it's getting crazy folks
[01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:44.120]  and the people leading it are like the most wild people there are
[01:51:44.120 --> 01:51:48.440]  and it's hillary clinton who protected pedophiles and protected her husband
[01:51:48.440 --> 01:51:55.000]  and she's the leader of protecting women again there's that added thing
[01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:59.800]  all right up next here carlos and chanada you're on the air carlos thanks
[01:51:59.800 --> 01:52:05.240]  for calling thank you alex um when a judge kavanaugh
[01:52:05.240 --> 01:52:10.360]  went to high school um every ritzy high school had a crissy
[01:52:10.360 --> 01:52:15.080]  so i i don't necessarily think that uh her reputation
[01:52:15.080 --> 01:52:18.920]  being destroyed is going to make as much of a difference as his reputation
[01:52:18.920 --> 01:52:22.760]  being destroyed destroyed but it isn't her that i blame
[01:52:22.760 --> 01:52:27.320]  i blame in this the responsible senators or irresponsible senators of the
[01:52:27.320 --> 01:52:31.240]  democratic party that had this thing it began
[01:52:31.240 --> 01:52:35.080]  actually the whole shenanigans began on election night
[01:52:35.080 --> 01:52:39.800]  when the defeated candidate did not go and tell the public
[01:52:39.800 --> 01:52:44.120]  look the president's been elected you elected the president tonight
[01:52:44.120 --> 01:52:48.440]  and i as a responsible politician responsible for political parties
[01:52:48.440 --> 01:52:53.480]  uh to you i'm telling you go home and be calm and be good to america
[01:52:53.480 --> 01:52:58.680]  no she didn't say that okay and from that moment on it has been shenanigans
[01:52:58.680 --> 01:53:02.760]  after shenanigans and at the point it comes to this
[01:53:02.760 --> 01:53:06.040]  to to a supreme court judge of impeccable
[01:53:06.040 --> 01:53:11.000]  character being submitted to this in his nomination
[01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:14.920]  this is a political party that doesn't deserve the naming no i agree so let me
[01:53:14.920 --> 01:53:17.800]  ask you this how does the democrats get punished for this because now that she's
[01:53:17.800 --> 01:53:20.920]  scared to testify it shows that the people know it's fake
[01:53:20.920 --> 01:53:24.120]  her she had a zero percent rating at college everybody hates her
[01:53:24.120 --> 01:53:27.640]  that they're expunging her whole record they're running scared why were they
[01:53:27.640 --> 01:53:31.560]  dumb enough to try this a and b i think they should still have hearings and
[01:53:31.560 --> 01:53:35.000]  Kavanaugh should show up and when they should expose all this
[01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:38.600]  of course and and of course the series there's they're supposed to be
[01:53:38.600 --> 01:53:42.920]  responsible but it seems to me that the republican party
[01:53:42.920 --> 01:53:46.840]  is in a position to to shame the democrat
[01:53:46.840 --> 01:53:51.000]  democratic party it looks it is legitimacy this is the party of jonath
[01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:54.840]  kennedy and the party of uh uh president carter i mean
[01:53:54.840 --> 01:53:59.800]  there are the presidents that that have been um responsible in their in their
[01:53:59.800 --> 01:54:03.800]  personal lives the the media was responsible
[01:54:03.800 --> 01:54:08.120]  senators were responsible this is this is a point at which
[01:54:08.120 --> 01:54:11.560]  it looks to me like they've gone whole hog uh
[01:54:11.560 --> 01:54:16.760]  morals out the window and big salaries and and you know inside a trading at
[01:54:16.760 --> 01:54:20.600]  vantages etc etc absolutely they're now a pure faction
[01:54:20.600 --> 01:54:24.200]  criminal organization cnn is the criminal news network
[01:54:24.200 --> 01:54:27.640]  they are a mob they know they're a mob they're not gonna stop they're clear
[01:54:27.640 --> 01:54:30.440]  and present danger they'll only stop once we stand up to them and let them
[01:54:30.440 --> 01:54:32.680]  know that we're done with them thank you so much carlos
[01:54:32.680 --> 01:54:36.120]  we're gonna madison uh after we go to miguel miguel
[01:54:36.120 --> 01:54:39.960]  in michigan thanks for holding her on the air
[01:54:40.680 --> 01:54:43.880]  i got uh i got a point that i haven't seen made
[01:54:43.880 --> 01:54:47.240]  uh in any of the mainstream news and i'm just wondering why
[01:54:47.240 --> 01:54:52.040]  they did this at the 11th hour uh so cabernon doesn't have any recourse if
[01:54:52.040 --> 01:54:55.000]  they would have brought this out in the hearings
[01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.480]  then there could have been a dialogue there could have been a back well that's
[01:54:57.480 --> 01:55:00.280]  what trump said actually trump pointed that out that if you had any
[01:55:00.280 --> 01:55:03.800]  teeth to this fine steinwood brought it up and cabernon was in front of her for
[01:55:03.800 --> 01:55:07.720]  eight hours on couple days but instead they didn't what does that tell you
[01:55:07.720 --> 01:55:10.840]  there's a reason for it too see what they're trying to do
[01:55:10.840 --> 01:55:15.320]  because of this uh upcoming election it's not even about cabernon has nothing
[01:55:15.320 --> 01:55:18.920]  to do with him they're tarnishing his name but they're doing it to get votes
[01:55:18.920 --> 01:55:23.000]  all of those women that went to trump because they were ready for a woman
[01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:27.160]  president just not that one they're trying to get them back
[01:55:27.160 --> 01:55:32.200]  and that's how i believe they think they're going to win their senate seats
[01:55:32.200 --> 01:55:36.440]  well that's it and but i mean i think women are smarter in in the main than
[01:55:36.440 --> 01:55:40.120]  hearing all this i think women overall see through this pandering
[01:55:40.120 --> 01:55:43.480]  oh we're the democrats we want to protect you from evil men oh
[01:55:43.480 --> 01:55:47.080]  meanwhile i'm hillary clinton i'm bill clinton it's ridiculous
[01:55:47.080 --> 01:55:50.680]  exactly and this is their underhanded tactics this is how they do it they
[01:55:50.680 --> 01:55:54.280]  know they can't get you in in the courts they know they can't get him in the
[01:55:54.280 --> 01:55:58.920]  hearings because he is unimpeachable so they're doing these underhanded tactics
[01:55:58.920 --> 01:56:04.120]  so he he can't he doesn't have a uh any way to defend himself this woman won't
[01:56:04.120 --> 01:56:07.960]  test to fly now all of a sudden she says she doesn't want to why
[01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:11.240]  because there's nothing to it and they just wanted to put a stain on this
[01:56:11.240 --> 01:56:14.840]  election to swing back some of those female voters
[01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:18.280]  that's right and you know that's that was the calculus
[01:56:18.280 --> 01:56:23.080]  this is a fraud we know it's not true but it'll hurt cabinon but it'll really
[01:56:23.080 --> 01:56:27.720]  get women mad at trump it'll bring that back up and make an election issue
[01:56:27.720 --> 01:56:30.760]  with just 40 something days out that's exactly right thank you for the call
[01:56:30.760 --> 01:56:35.560]  miguel when i come back from break we're going to go to madison and wild and
[01:56:35.560 --> 01:56:38.760]  duncan and alex and zack and rj and steve and
[01:56:38.760 --> 01:56:44.040]  so many others uh jason and canada that are holding
[01:56:44.040 --> 01:56:49.080]  this is just such big news this this these high school annuals
[01:56:49.080 --> 01:56:53.480]  and it makes me think back to the 80s how wild they were
[01:56:53.480 --> 01:56:57.480]  and it was not a good thing by the way because i was not even
[01:56:57.480 --> 01:57:03.240]  amongst the most wild and it was wild it was wild i mean everybody thought life
[01:57:03.240 --> 01:57:06.840]  was risky business or something and you look at this and you see what a
[01:57:06.840 --> 01:57:09.640]  tart she is in these high school annuals
[01:57:09.640 --> 01:57:12.680]  and then she's this big flamboyant liberal professor
[01:57:12.680 --> 01:57:16.600]  this activist and then she's this big abortion company promoter
[01:57:16.600 --> 01:57:20.280]  and then she's going up to cabinon and it makes total
[01:57:20.280 --> 01:57:25.320]  sense these are just mercenaries these are just people that will do whatever it
[01:57:25.320 --> 01:57:30.280]  takes in the corporate structure to climb the ladder the left aren't the left
[01:57:30.280 --> 01:57:34.280]  folks they are a group of foaming at the mouth
[01:57:34.280 --> 01:57:37.640]  political opportunist hour number three with your calls
[01:57:37.640 --> 01:57:41.640]  laura loomer on real democrat assaults on women this is a big global
[01:57:41.640 --> 01:57:45.000]  bombshell in the next hour and the racism ties
[01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:50.680]  to the cabinon accuser x2 we were selling it for about three years
[01:57:50.680 --> 01:57:53.960]  and then they found out how big it was and i was we were buying and they said oh
[01:57:53.960 --> 01:57:57.640]  we want more money more money and oh this and that and so i've broken my
[01:57:57.640 --> 01:58:00.440]  contract and right now we can't get more of this
[01:58:00.440 --> 01:58:04.760]  proprietary ingredient that goes in x2 that literally is so pure that if you
[01:58:04.760 --> 01:58:08.760]  put in a picker dish on top of 90 degree hot plate it gasses
[01:58:08.760 --> 01:58:12.600]  like i dream of genie and it's purple gas i mean that is so pure it just goes
[01:58:12.600 --> 01:58:15.400]  right into your body when you take it we're working on trying to get other
[01:58:15.400 --> 01:58:19.560]  suppliers right now but i bought a huge amount of it
[01:58:19.560 --> 01:58:23.640]  ordered it six months ago so i get the price down i said if you don't lower it
[01:58:23.640 --> 01:58:27.080]  i'm done i'm breaking the contract well i broke the contract last week
[01:58:27.080 --> 01:58:31.160]  and so this is potentially the last run in fact right now it is the last run

[02:00:06.520 --> 02:00:10.200]  john said that they really don't do that that's not what they do
[02:00:10.200 --> 02:00:15.080]  and now they have done supposedly six background checks over the years as
[02:00:15.080 --> 02:00:20.600]  judge Kavanaugh has gone beautifully up a ladder he's an incredible individual
[02:00:20.600 --> 02:00:27.400]  visual great intellect great judge impeccable history in every way
[02:00:27.400 --> 02:00:31.560]  in every way i feel so badly for him that he's
[02:00:31.560 --> 02:00:35.160]  going through this to be honest with you i feel so badly for him
[02:00:35.160 --> 02:00:39.560]  this is not a man that deserves this this should have been brought to
[02:00:39.560 --> 02:00:45.320]  the fore it should have been brought up long ago and that's what you have
[02:00:45.320 --> 02:00:48.280]  hearings for you don't wait till the hearing is over and then all of a
[02:00:48.280 --> 02:00:52.920]  sudden bring it up when senator feinstein sat
[02:00:52.920 --> 02:00:56.840]  with judge Kavanaugh for a long period of time
[02:00:56.840 --> 02:01:02.040]  a long long meeting she had this letter why didn't she bring it up
[02:01:02.040 --> 02:01:05.160]  why didn't she bring it up then why didn't the democrats bring it up then
[02:01:05.160 --> 02:01:09.720]  because they obstruct and because they resist that's the name of their campaign
[02:01:09.720 --> 02:01:14.440]  against me we they just resist and they just
[02:01:14.440 --> 02:01:20.280]  obstruct then frankly i think they're lousy on policy and in many ways they're
[02:01:20.280 --> 02:01:25.080]  lousy politicians but they're very good on obstruction
[02:01:25.080 --> 02:01:30.200]  and it's a shame because this is a great gentleman
[02:01:30.200 --> 02:01:33.720]  i don't normally play a clip twice on the show but but trump is dead on there
[02:01:33.720 --> 02:01:36.760]  they waited the last minute because they knew it was a fraud
[02:01:36.760 --> 02:01:41.320]  now they said okay have the hearings they thought the republicans wouldn't have
[02:01:41.320 --> 02:01:46.200]  them now they call the bluff oh sorry she can't no
[02:01:46.200 --> 02:01:50.280]  we will come in there and we will put up images of you in high school
[02:01:50.280 --> 02:01:53.560]  we will talk about the drunken parties the blackout parties with your name
[02:01:53.560 --> 02:01:57.640]  specifically in there and we will look at the male escort dancers and all this
[02:01:57.640 --> 02:02:02.040]  we'll show real photos of you at 17 not the stuff you've been putting out and
[02:02:02.040 --> 02:02:05.320]  we'll have a discussion we'll call on the witnesses you said we're eyewitnesses
[02:02:05.320 --> 02:02:09.800]  who said they never said that we'll talk about you and your abortion
[02:02:09.800 --> 02:02:12.440]  company you're part of that you write papers for
[02:02:12.440 --> 02:02:16.200]  are you 486 oh but see you don't want that now
[02:02:16.200 --> 02:02:20.600]  so the question is what will the system pull now
[02:02:20.600 --> 02:02:26.200]  madison in chicago you're on the air talking about net censorship go ahead
[02:02:26.200 --> 02:02:29.720]  yeah i'll speak to fan and um first of all i'm gonna
[02:02:29.720 --> 02:02:32.760]  before i start it's going to get rough for the next two weeks
[02:02:32.760 --> 02:02:36.760]  and i'm going to ask if you have a money bomb and we'll see if we can get you
[02:02:36.760 --> 02:02:40.280]  through the election are you saying you want me to have
[02:02:40.280 --> 02:02:45.160]  a money bomb to fund fund the operation we do i absolutely thank you
[02:02:45.160 --> 02:02:48.920]  but if you do it could you have an address to the nation and tell everybody
[02:02:48.920 --> 02:02:51.960]  who you are and what you stand for give us a couple of weeks that way we can
[02:02:51.960 --> 02:02:56.680]  have people over to the house and kind of introduce you well i mean i
[02:02:56.680 --> 02:02:59.560]  should do an address to the nation talk about why we what we stand for while
[02:02:59.560 --> 02:03:02.040]  we're under attack and why we need to be supported that's actually a good idea i
[02:03:02.040 --> 02:03:05.320]  thought of that okay i'm i'm going to disagree with you
[02:03:05.320 --> 02:03:09.000]  about net censorship i don't think it's political i think what
[02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:13.400]  happened is july 26 facebook had the greatest
[02:03:13.400 --> 02:03:16.920]  loss of all time a hundred billion dollars
[02:03:16.920 --> 02:03:20.200]  and we knew that was going to happen because the insiders
[02:03:20.200 --> 02:03:25.000]  have themselves in stock at a rate i'm seen a unheard of
[02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.720]  ever uh zucker bergen them that they have sold
[02:03:27.720 --> 02:03:30.680]  four five billion dollars with the stock in their own company
[02:03:30.680 --> 02:03:34.040]  after the stock goes down they sell even more
[02:03:34.040 --> 02:03:37.240]  and you can go to um the internet and see insider
[02:03:37.240 --> 02:03:42.760]  selling for facebook and at a lower price they are selling more and more
[02:03:42.760 --> 02:03:49.240]  my contention is that after this hundred billion dollar loss
[02:03:49.240 --> 02:03:52.440]  knowing an investigation is going to come because of their false guidance
[02:03:52.440 --> 02:03:56.280]  knowing the accounting of regularities they attacked you
[02:03:56.280 --> 02:03:59.640]  and they attacked every other conservative out there
[02:03:59.640 --> 02:04:02.840]  knowing the trump administration is going to investigate them
[02:04:02.840 --> 02:04:06.840]  that way they can say it's all political and nobody's looking at them
[02:04:06.840 --> 02:04:11.320]  oh you're really smart yeah the pump and dump that it was set up at bilgerberg
[02:04:11.320 --> 02:04:15.640]  10 years ago to do it is confirmed that they are doing this it is a giant scam
[02:04:15.640 --> 02:04:19.480]  it's all a big worthless hollowed fraud they know their business models come
[02:04:19.480 --> 02:04:21.960]  into an end because of illegal spying and data money to do it
[02:04:21.960 --> 02:04:24.360]  stay there i'm gonna come back and finish with you and then they get laura
[02:04:24.360 --> 02:04:28.040]  limo this is really important and so now by going out to conservatives
[02:04:28.040 --> 02:04:33.960]  they make it political when all of the insider trading comes up
[02:04:33.960 --> 02:04:36.920]  exact strict and third quarter students even worse
[02:04:36.920 --> 02:04:42.440]  and you've already called for an investigation everybody has
[02:04:42.440 --> 02:04:46.520]  from the hegelian dialect you're absolutely right and then and then

[02:07:30.120 --> 02:07:34.040]  began crying so we'll be talking to her in just a
[02:07:34.040 --> 02:07:37.000]  moment but madison brought up a really great point i remember
[02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:41.400]  covering facebook 10 years ago at bill berg they were
[02:07:41.400 --> 02:07:46.040]  getting ready to have their public offering and now it was a bump and dump
[02:07:46.040 --> 02:07:49.560]  and now zuckerberg went there to get the big european and us regulators to
[02:07:49.560 --> 02:07:53.000]  give the seat of approval for a pump and dump and you look at the way over
[02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:56.040]  valuation overvaluation of facebook
[02:07:56.040 --> 02:07:59.400]  you look at how the new rules coming in will cripple its ability to spy on
[02:07:59.400 --> 02:08:03.480]  people as its main business model and now you see it
[02:08:03.480 --> 02:08:07.080]  plunge over a hundred something billion dollars in one week
[02:08:07.080 --> 02:08:12.040]  zuckerberg and others insiders selling a crap ton of it out of there
[02:08:12.040 --> 02:08:15.240]  while they try to oppose prompt so jennad even keep the economy going on the
[02:08:15.240 --> 02:08:19.720]  caller said hey they've already shadowban conservative 95 percent
[02:08:19.720 --> 02:08:23.320]  dialed you back to nothing governed you back to nothing choked you back to
[02:08:23.320 --> 02:08:26.200]  nothing with the dog chain around your neck
[02:08:26.200 --> 02:08:30.200]  why they picked the fight with alex jones knowing it would go super frenzy
[02:08:30.200 --> 02:08:32.680]  and then ban all these thousands of other conservatives
[02:08:32.680 --> 02:08:36.280]  show that when the regulators everybody come after them for insider trading
[02:08:36.280 --> 02:08:41.320]  they can say it's political and i think that was a missing piece
[02:08:41.320 --> 02:08:44.200]  of why are they doing this when they'll blow up in their face
[02:08:44.200 --> 02:08:48.200]  why are they doing it's making me even bigger why are they you're right
[02:08:48.200 --> 02:08:51.320]  it makes it about a free speech issue and a
[02:08:51.320 --> 02:08:55.240]  and a issue of anti-trust and these groups working in combine
[02:08:55.240 --> 02:08:59.000]  instead of the real issue of how it's insider trading
[02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:02.440]  now i'm not saying you're a hundred percent right but it really rings true
[02:09:02.440 --> 02:09:05.880]  with i know about the insider trading the pump and dump all the things we
[02:09:05.880 --> 02:09:09.560]  witnessed with these big tech companies and just how ruthless they are
[02:09:09.560 --> 02:09:12.840]  why do you think then in the media apple was in there
[02:09:12.840 --> 02:09:17.720]  as a major mover in getting them all to consolidate and make this move
[02:09:17.720 --> 02:09:22.840]  what do you think madison first of all um if we're still friends with max
[02:09:22.840 --> 02:09:25.400]  keiser i would have him on and talk about it he's
[02:09:25.400 --> 02:09:30.280]  much more close but there is a basket called
[02:09:30.280 --> 02:09:35.800]  bang facebook amazon apple netflix and google
[02:09:35.800 --> 02:09:39.480]  and when investors can buy basket of stocks
[02:09:39.480 --> 02:09:45.080]  if you get down deeper microsoft has um venture capital
[02:09:45.080 --> 02:09:49.160]  and all of these companies and there are other companies too i i can't go into
[02:09:49.160 --> 02:09:53.160]  too much detail no but exactly microsoft's one of the big movers
[02:09:53.160 --> 02:09:56.840]  it can't be a monopoly it got broken up in the 90s so it's really behind a lot
[02:09:56.840 --> 02:10:00.120]  of these companies and if you look at where microsoft
[02:10:00.120 --> 02:10:04.680]  is partnered with there's a gentleman out of hong kong in canada
[02:10:04.680 --> 02:10:07.880]  uh he's very easy to google and find out his name i'm not going to even try to
[02:10:07.880 --> 02:10:12.280]  pronounce it on the radio uh and he's got shiny fact money
[02:10:12.280 --> 02:10:15.320]  so you get that back a little bit deeper and a little bit deeper
[02:10:15.320 --> 02:10:19.960]  you find the chinese microsoft deal gates and all these companies are
[02:10:19.960 --> 02:10:23.000]  connected i heard all these companies banning you
[02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:26.520]  and they were all connected through venture capital
[02:10:26.520 --> 02:10:30.600]  venture capital to just lose a lot of money when the thing
[02:10:30.600 --> 02:10:36.280]  when um the thing that fast collapses with the exception of amazon amazon's a
[02:10:36.280 --> 02:10:39.480]  little bit different they're kind of on their own no i agree in fact i've been
[02:10:39.480 --> 02:10:41.880]  told that by high-level folks in the cia that
[02:10:41.880 --> 02:10:44.840]  hey amazon you think they're bad but really that's more of an american
[02:10:44.840 --> 02:10:47.560]  company they're fighting with alibaba and the chinese
[02:10:47.560 --> 02:10:51.160]  they're actually somewhat more of a stable company bezos has his own problems
[02:10:51.160 --> 02:10:54.520]  but he's not as bad as tim cook uh and the others you're absolutely right
[02:10:54.520 --> 02:10:58.600]  the communist chinese money is in all these companies that deal was made
[02:10:58.600 --> 02:11:02.280]  decades ago and i thought i was being taken down because i was going after
[02:11:02.280 --> 02:11:05.800]  those chinese deals and i think that was part of it but i agree with you to a
[02:11:05.800 --> 02:11:09.880]  great extent they want to make it about censorship
[02:11:09.880 --> 02:11:14.120]  instead of making it about the stock manipulation let me ask you this question
[02:11:14.120 --> 02:11:17.160]  why then is all this big money started moving out of
[02:11:17.160 --> 02:11:23.800]  um facebook and out of google and and out of twitter why do we see george
[02:11:23.800 --> 02:11:29.240]  soros moving in i'm not sure george soros
[02:11:29.240 --> 02:11:33.560]  is moving in with his own money but it's moving out
[02:11:33.560 --> 02:11:37.480]  because they know third quarter is coming third quarter happens right around
[02:11:37.480 --> 02:11:42.200]  the time of the election that's um and that's the word as they
[02:11:42.200 --> 02:11:45.240]  planned to plunge the stock market to blame trump before the election
[02:11:45.240 --> 02:11:49.720]  that's the real that's the real october surprise or was it the stock market
[02:11:49.720 --> 02:11:54.840]  is going to plunge we know what's going to happen but set up a firm
[02:11:54.840 --> 02:11:58.680]  i don't know alex this is that the conspiracy is too deep for me i just
[02:11:58.680 --> 02:12:02.680]  know that this this part has happened what's going to happen i don't know
[02:12:02.680 --> 02:12:07.480]  but um kaiser has a lot of respect from a lot of financial people
[02:12:07.480 --> 02:12:12.760]  and he could um he could he should shed more light he's more qualified than i am
[02:12:12.760 --> 02:12:16.440]  so we should get max back on the show we in fact we'll do that
[02:12:16.440 --> 02:12:19.000]  i know max for looking here's for taking care of family stuff that's why
[02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:22.200]  hasn't been as active in media period i'm gonna leave it at that we need to get
[02:12:22.200 --> 02:12:24.760]  max back on the show thank you so much madison good points
[02:12:24.760 --> 02:12:27.560]  all right we'll get to everybody else here but laura lumbers with us for
[02:12:27.560 --> 02:12:31.400]  several segments when we come back uh she's still on twitter for now at laura
[02:12:31.400 --> 02:12:35.000]  lumbers you can go see her big article at bigleaguepolitics.com
[02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:38.280]  medical records document keith ellison's physical and emotional abuse
[02:12:38.280 --> 02:12:43.000]  uh look if they had records at cabinon
[02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:48.920]  actually raped a woman 36 years ago i'd say okay he shouldn't be nominated
[02:12:48.920 --> 02:12:52.680]  in fact he wasn't my first choice but there's nothing there's nothing
[02:12:52.680 --> 02:12:57.000]  and i get accused of wearing nazi tennis shoes
[02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:01.320]  and you know the guy that followed complaints that well he never hit on me
[02:13:01.320 --> 02:13:05.000]  but i felt like he was he was grooming me for gay
[02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:10.120]  sex i mean come on folks so i have experienced the insane
[02:13:10.120 --> 02:13:13.720]  lies of the media and so that's why i've learned
[02:13:13.720 --> 02:13:17.480]  that they're a load of crap most of the time but this her now saying that she's
[02:13:17.480 --> 02:13:20.680]  not going to testify and the rest of it this shows you the
[02:13:20.680 --> 02:13:23.720]  wheels have come off and so i wonder what they're going to do next in
[02:13:23.720 --> 02:13:27.160]  trump derangement syndrome because why would they bring forward a woman
[02:13:27.160 --> 02:13:29.800]  but they had to get rid of all of her college records all of her high school
[02:13:29.800 --> 02:13:33.640]  records her high school annuals her her stanford reviews her
[02:13:33.640 --> 02:13:37.720]  college reviews her student reviews her social media
[02:13:37.720 --> 02:13:43.960]  why because she's a shameful person she doesn't like what she's done and now
[02:13:43.960 --> 02:13:47.720]  she's a kingpin writing propaganda for
[02:13:47.720 --> 02:13:51.000]  a hundred something billion dollar abortion company
[02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:54.840]  who cabinon directly threatens she believes so the abortion industry isn't
[02:13:54.840 --> 02:13:57.960]  going to stand back in the middle of their population
[02:13:57.960 --> 02:14:01.800]  reduction their bonanza big article up on info wars.com
[02:14:01.800 --> 02:14:05.400]  dealing with all that right now we we did post mike adam's whole story right
[02:14:05.400 --> 02:14:09.000]  from naturalnews.com that needs to go super viral
[02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:13.160]  but still almost no one has picked up this story of her annuals
[02:14:13.160 --> 02:14:17.000]  it's been out for days people have been scared to go with it it is the annuals
[02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:20.520]  it's it's they don't know about her at big parties and blacking out
[02:14:20.520 --> 02:14:23.960]  that right there is totally discrediting why aren't people touching it because
[02:14:23.960 --> 02:14:28.360]  there's this atmosphere where if you go after the
[02:14:28.360 --> 02:14:31.720]  globalists and you after their operatives they attack you
[02:14:31.720 --> 02:14:35.880]  they shoo you they defame you they try to destroy you
[02:14:35.880 --> 02:14:40.920]  and if we have that cuckold wimpy attitude we're going to lose the whole
[02:14:40.920 --> 02:14:44.360]  country in the whole world the globalists are going for broke so
[02:14:44.360 --> 02:14:47.880]  i know i'm in the crosshairs because i tell the truth i know when the crosshairs
[02:14:47.880 --> 02:14:51.400]  because i take on the big dangerous challenges and i expose the pedophile

[02:21:00.920 --> 02:21:04.440]  why you've been investigating him and the medical records that you found thanks
[02:21:04.440 --> 02:21:08.520]  for joining us thanks for having me alex it's good to see you last time i saw
[02:21:08.520 --> 02:21:12.360]  you we were tracking down jack dorsi that's right that was that was quite a
[02:21:12.360 --> 02:21:17.720]  circus and we were polite to him that they said i was rude so i'm banned
[02:21:17.720 --> 02:21:20.920]  yeah well they threw me out of congress for confronting him too even though he
[02:21:20.920 --> 02:21:24.280]  committed the crime of perjury you know lying to congress but so yeah saying
[02:21:24.280 --> 02:21:26.920]  that he doesn't sense the conservatives
[02:21:26.920 --> 02:21:29.960]  yeah exactly and of course they gave a pass to all the liberals who were in the
[02:21:29.960 --> 02:21:34.040]  cavanaugh hearing and grasley said well we have to respect their right to free
[02:21:34.040 --> 02:21:37.800]  speech and they the republicans bent over backwards for the liberals in the
[02:21:37.800 --> 02:21:41.160]  cavanaugh hearing but of course i was they they lied you know they lied and
[02:21:41.160 --> 02:21:44.200]  they said that i was shouted down by this representative billy long but if you
[02:21:44.200 --> 02:21:46.680]  listen to my audio of my video that i put out
[02:21:46.680 --> 02:21:50.040]  you can hear me if anything my voice my voice is very loud you know me you've
[02:21:50.040 --> 02:21:53.240]  seen my voice in person you can hear me and my voice is actually
[02:21:53.240 --> 02:21:56.520]  overpowering that we should play your version coming up because instead they
[02:21:56.520 --> 02:22:00.120]  just cut to his mic going well it's not like
[02:22:00.120 --> 02:22:04.680]  corky pig was trying to drown you out yeah exactly and i i was just telling
[02:22:04.680 --> 02:22:07.800]  people like that's the most he's used his mouth since the last time he ate
[02:22:07.800 --> 02:22:11.960]  lunch and you know no one's ever heard of this guy until i came along honestly
[02:22:11.960 --> 02:22:14.760]  i agree just sitting over there like a demonic toad until you show
[02:22:14.760 --> 02:22:16.920]  me one hundred seventy five ninety four
[02:22:16.920 --> 02:22:20.600]  all night they're gonna bring their own big man yeah
[02:22:20.600 --> 02:22:24.200]  yeah it's really shameful too because none of the representatives in that
[02:22:24.200 --> 02:22:28.760]  hearing ask any legitimate questions to jack dorsi about the censorship and i
[02:22:28.760 --> 02:22:32.840]  was the really the only person besides you who showed up to really
[02:22:32.840 --> 02:22:35.720]  talk some sense into people because they could have talked about the project
[02:22:35.720 --> 02:22:39.400]  Veritas videos. They could have talked about how the employee admitted to deleting President
[02:22:39.400 --> 02:22:43.480]  Trump's account. Remember when someone actually like deleted President Trump's account for several
[02:22:43.480 --> 02:22:47.800]  minutes. But of course, these Republicans, I wouldn't even be surprised, surprised if some of
[02:22:47.800 --> 02:22:53.800]  them are getting paid by big tech on the side because they just were so milk toast. Like they
[02:22:53.800 --> 02:22:59.400]  were, they were so calm and they didn't really confront or question Jack Dorsey to the level
[02:22:59.400 --> 02:23:03.160]  that they should have. And let's be clear, you aren't just heckling. You were bringing up real
[02:23:03.160 --> 02:23:07.640]  points about, I've been censored. It's wrong. And instead, some Humpty Dumpty guy that I've never
[02:23:07.640 --> 02:23:11.560]  even heard of, suddenly like this Humpty Dumpty head appears one, one hundred and nine, seven,
[02:23:11.560 --> 02:23:16.760]  four, three, nine, eight. We've got to play it later. It's insane. And I also, I mentioned the
[02:23:16.760 --> 02:23:20.520]  names of people who had been censored and I would have said your name too, but then he banned you
[02:23:20.520 --> 02:23:26.360]  the next day. But it's legitimate. And everything I said was factual. I was respectful. I didn't
[02:23:26.360 --> 02:23:31.400]  resist police. And yeah, I mean, look, I'm getting a lot of heat from conservatives too. But at the
[02:23:31.400 --> 02:23:35.640]  end of the day, we have to fight like the Democrats. They don't, they don't care about morals. They
[02:23:35.640 --> 02:23:39.800]  don't care about ethics. And honestly, in my opinion, you know, the Republicans are always
[02:23:39.800 --> 02:23:44.040]  so concerned about being better, right? Oh, we can't suit to the level of the Democrats. Well,
[02:23:44.040 --> 02:23:49.080]  I say when they go low, we go lower because we're not going to defeat the left unless we play by
[02:23:49.080 --> 02:23:53.960]  their playbook. Well, I say this, they've got clubs and we should at least take the gloves off.
[02:23:53.960 --> 02:23:58.440]  I mean, I wouldn't even say go lower. I'm just saying, because I'm not disagreeing with it,
[02:23:58.440 --> 02:24:02.600]  but I'm saying they're already in the streets. So we've got to get the streets.
[02:24:03.240 --> 02:24:06.840]  Yeah. And I'm not saying we should incite violence because I'm not a violent person,
[02:24:06.840 --> 02:24:09.880]  and I don't think that we should advocate. No, I'm just saying it's time to take the gloves off
[02:24:09.880 --> 02:24:13.640]  politically. We have a right to protest, right? We have a right to protest just like any of them
[02:24:13.640 --> 02:24:18.760]  do. And so for Republicans to say things like, well, you know, you need to show some decorum or
[02:24:18.760 --> 02:24:21.640]  that's not appropriate for you to protest during a congressional hearing.
[02:24:21.640 --> 02:24:24.760]  And it's supposed to just silence you. And that's the end of it. But let's shift gears.
[02:24:24.760 --> 02:24:29.880]  What do you make of the cabin on accuser and these racy yearbooks where it sounds like quite the
[02:24:29.880 --> 02:24:34.920]  high school to go to sounds like a brothel or something. And just all it's a total opposite
[02:24:34.920 --> 02:24:39.480]  of what they portrayed about her. And then all the weirdness. I mean, what do you think that's
[02:24:39.480 --> 02:24:44.280]  killing in her withdrawing that she wants to testify? Well, it's the weaponization of the
[02:24:44.280 --> 02:24:48.680]  Me Too movements. And I think she's now realized that, oh my God, I'm going to have to commit
[02:24:48.680 --> 02:24:54.520]  perjury if I testify under oath to the FBI and the Senate about this. And it's one thing
[02:24:54.520 --> 02:24:59.080]  for her to lie and have the help of the mainstream media in spreading this message. But it's
[02:24:59.080 --> 02:25:03.640]  another thing to actually testify under oath and commit perjury. Like you can go to jail for that.
[02:25:03.640 --> 02:25:08.600]  And so of course, the media has totally disregarded all defamation libel laws and they're just smearing
[02:25:09.960 --> 02:25:12.920]  Kavanaugh, who really is an innocent man. I mean, you have all these women who came to his
[02:25:12.920 --> 02:25:18.840]  defense. This woman has absolutely no evidence whatsoever to support her accusations of,
[02:25:18.840 --> 02:25:24.360]  you know, what sounds like a wild high school party, right? I mean, they're acting like he
[02:25:24.360 --> 02:25:29.880]  raped her. He didn't rape her. But then meanwhile, you have actual police reports and medical records
[02:25:29.880 --> 02:25:36.200]  from two women, not just one, two separate women, Democrat women who dated Keith Ellison and have
[02:25:36.200 --> 02:25:42.120]  accused him of being very physically emotionally and verbally abusive, right? And the Democrats
[02:25:42.120 --> 02:25:46.840]  just want to turn a blind eye the same way that they did to Bill Clinton when Juanita Broderick
[02:25:46.840 --> 02:25:51.640]  and several other women came out and accused him of rape. So look, the Democrats don't care about
[02:25:51.640 --> 02:25:56.920]  me too. They only care so much as they can, you know, commit character assassination against
[02:25:56.920 --> 02:26:01.880]  innocent people and get what they want. We see they did this to Donald Trump as well without
[02:26:01.880 --> 02:26:07.000]  any evidence whatsoever, right? Let's start getting into your article then, particularly Keith Ellison,
[02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:11.400]  because you've been on his tail. Let's talk about some of these medical records and why you've been
[02:26:11.400 --> 02:26:17.320]  up in that area of Minnesota investigating him so much. So I've been investigating Keith Ellison
[02:26:17.320 --> 02:26:21.720]  because like I said, the media is giving him a pass and they're not confronting him or questioning
[02:26:21.720 --> 02:26:27.480]  him about the police report. So I was, I was the reporter who broke the story about the police report
[02:26:27.480 --> 02:26:33.080]  and it's on my website. You can see it there. And so I took the police report to his campaign event
[02:26:33.080 --> 02:26:37.480]  in the beginning of the month earlier this month and I confronted him on camera and he ran away
[02:26:37.480 --> 02:26:45.560]  from me and he had his staffers, some of whom were Muslim men. They were also following in his
[02:26:45.560 --> 02:26:50.360]  footsteps and using their body weight to shove me and intimidate me. But you know me, anyone who
[02:26:50.360 --> 02:26:54.200]  knows me, that's not going to stop me, right? I've been assaulted on camera before. Like I just,
[02:26:54.200 --> 02:26:58.200]  I will push through and I'll keep doing what I have to do to get a story. And so I put my
[02:26:58.200 --> 02:27:02.040]  camera in Keith Ellison's face and I kept asking him, what about this police report? I mean,
[02:27:02.040 --> 02:27:06.120]  how do you expect to be attorney general when you have multiple allegations about
[02:27:06.120 --> 02:27:09.640]  domestic violence against you? You can't be attorney general. You have to step down. I mean,
[02:27:09.640 --> 02:27:13.880]  there's a police report. There's, there's videos. What are you going to do, Keith? And he literally
[02:27:13.880 --> 02:27:18.680]  ran away from me and hid inside his car before he could speak. I mean, this is, as you can see
[02:27:18.680 --> 02:27:23.400]  from the video, I confronted him as he was arriving for his events and he had to leave the event.
[02:27:23.400 --> 02:27:28.840]  He couldn't even speak because he was just so scared of me. I mean, he couldn't answer questions
[02:27:28.840 --> 02:27:32.920]  and it just goes to show you how much of a coward he is. This is a man who puts his hands on women.
[02:27:32.920 --> 02:27:37.400]  He supports your real law, right? He's a Muslim. He loves talking about the fact that he's the first
[02:27:37.400 --> 02:27:43.320]  Muslim congressman as if that's like some type of accomplishment or something. And then he will,
[02:27:44.920 --> 02:27:48.280]  you know, he wants to be attorney general, but people aren't talking about what it means for
[02:27:48.280 --> 02:27:53.160]  women having a Muslim attorney general. What that means under Sharia, women are treated like
[02:27:53.160 --> 02:27:57.480]  property. So for Keith Ellison, of course, he's going to deny the allegations of domestic violence
[02:27:57.480 --> 02:28:02.840]  and he thinks he did nothing wrong because for him under Sharia, domestic violence and beating
[02:28:02.840 --> 02:28:09.080]  women is completely permissible. And the left always defends sex abuse. You name it by Muslims.
[02:28:09.080 --> 02:28:14.520]  It's sick. Yeah, because they, they, they can pass it off as something that's like culturally
[02:28:14.520 --> 02:28:18.680]  relative to them because like I said, it's permissible. So then you also have another Jihadi
[02:28:18.680 --> 02:28:23.800]  running for office in Minnesota by the name of Ilhan Omar. She's a woman who's running. She's
[02:28:23.800 --> 02:28:28.920]  from Somalia. She's an immigrant and she is running to replace Keith Ellison because he's
[02:28:28.920 --> 02:28:33.400]  obviously running to be attorney general and she is running for his congressional seat. And she
[02:28:33.400 --> 02:28:38.200]  actually supports female genital mutilation. There was a bill that was proposed in Congress,
[02:28:38.200 --> 02:28:42.200]  well in the, in the house of representatives in Minnesota that would have made female genital
[02:28:42.200 --> 02:28:47.160]  mutilation a felony and she voted against it. This lady also married her brother. By the way,
[02:28:47.160 --> 02:28:51.560]  she married her brother so that he could get a green card. She committed immigration fraud by
[02:28:51.560 --> 02:28:57.800]  their lawyer. We'll be right back. Stay with us. You've heard the phrase. You are what you eat, not
[02:28:57.800 --> 02:29:02.280]  true. Actually, you are what you can absorb. So if the vitamins and supplements you now take are

[02:29:25.240 --> 02:29:29.480]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my
[02:29:29.480 --> 02:29:34.760]  mother's house. I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:29:34.760 --> 02:29:38.760]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems
[02:29:38.760 --> 02:29:43.560]  they thought might never be solved. I can help you too. If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't
[02:29:43.560 --> 02:29:49.240]  wait another day. There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case. Call 800-34-no-tax or go to my
[02:29:49.240 --> 02:29:54.200]  website, danpilla.com. That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[02:29:56.040 --> 02:30:01.400]  X2, we were selling it for about three years and then they found out how big it was and how much
[02:30:01.400 --> 02:30:06.040]  we were buying and they said, oh we want more money, more money and oh this and that and so I've
[02:30:06.040 --> 02:30:12.040]  broken my contract and right now we can't get more of this proprietary ingredient that goes in X2
[02:30:12.040 --> 02:30:17.640]  that literally is so pure that if you put in a peaker dish on top of 90 degree hot plate it gasses
[02:30:17.640 --> 02:30:22.040]  like I dream of genie and then it's purple gas. I mean that is so pure it just goes right into your
[02:30:22.040 --> 02:30:27.080]  body when you take it. We're working on trying to get other suppliers right now but I bought a huge
[02:30:27.080 --> 02:30:32.680]  amount of it, ordered it six months ago so I get the price down. I said if you don't lower it I'm
[02:30:32.680 --> 02:30:37.640]  done I'm breaking the contract. Well I wrote the contract last week and so this is potentially
[02:30:37.640 --> 02:30:43.160]  the last run, in fact right now it is the last run of survival shield X2 and we've got a good
[02:30:43.160 --> 02:30:48.200]  supply of it, it'll be gone a couple months. X2, if you haven't experienced it, infowarstore.com,

[02:32:59.240 --> 02:33:07.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:07.720 --> 02:33:24.600]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:24.600 --> 02:33:41.000]  All right, Laura Loomers with us. We're going to go back into Keith Ellison and the reports,
[02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:45.320]  the medical reports of women assaulted by him. These are actual reports documented by medical
[02:33:45.320 --> 02:33:50.120]  professionals not hearsay from 36 years ago, completely different. I mean, if they had this
[02:33:50.120 --> 02:33:54.600]  on Kavanaugh and say the last five years, I'd say, okay, he's toast, but they don't. It's a political
[02:33:54.600 --> 02:34:01.480]  operative with an abortion company, a leftist out of control whack job professor whose whole story
[02:34:01.480 --> 02:34:05.560]  about how she was in high school turned out to be a total fraud. She was basically swinging from
[02:34:05.560 --> 02:34:15.000]  the chandeliers metaphorically. And now they want to stop Kavanaugh. We've got video here from Fox
[02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:22.280]  News of all these women protesting outside over the Kavanaugh situation. And you talk about the
[02:34:22.280 --> 02:34:29.000]  archetype of a bunch of angry leftist women. There you go. Was there upset about Bill Clinton
[02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:33.080]  or the Islamic massive rape gangs in Europe or all the rest of it? But no, they're not.
[02:34:34.440 --> 02:34:39.480]  No, they're not. It's Kavanaugh 36 years ago because he's an effing white male, as they would say.
[02:34:39.480 --> 02:34:46.760]  This is Laura Loomer brings us up. Here's her version a few weeks ago in the Senate Intelligence
[02:34:46.760 --> 02:34:53.560]  Committee asking real questions rather than the House Committee. And then we've got the House
[02:34:53.560 --> 02:34:57.880]  member who again does appear to be Humpty Dumpty born again, who said he couldn't be put back
[02:34:57.880 --> 02:35:05.240]  together again, engaging in bizarre auctioneering behavior, which dehumanized her as a taxpayer
[02:35:05.240 --> 02:35:10.200]  in there, not just shouting slogans, but bringing up real questions as a victim of Jack Dorsey's
[02:35:10.200 --> 02:35:17.800]  censorship. Here it is. You are caught on tape by Project Veritas, shadow banning people,
[02:35:17.800 --> 02:35:22.120]  you are censoring people, you censored me, you censored Milo, you censored Chuck Johnson,
[02:35:22.120 --> 02:35:25.960]  James Dopee, you even censored President Trump when one of your employees deleted his account
[02:35:25.960 --> 02:35:30.520]  for a few minutes. You are censoring conservatives. And I'm asking you, President Donald Trump,
[02:35:30.520 --> 02:35:35.640]  help us. Please help us, Mr. President, before it is too late, because Jack Dorsey is trying to
[02:35:35.640 --> 02:35:40.920]  influence the election, to sway the election so that the Democrats can steal the election.
[02:35:40.920 --> 02:35:46.440]  That is why he is censoring and shadow banning conservatives. You are a liar, Jack Dorsey.
[02:35:46.440 --> 02:35:51.960]  You are a liar, Jack Dorsey. You unverified me on November 15, 2017.
[02:35:51.960 --> 02:35:58.440]  Officer, will you escort this young lady out, please?
[02:35:58.440 --> 02:36:04.680]  Stop the bias. We are conservative Americans. Stop Russian bots, Jack Dorsey. Stop the bias.
[02:36:09.880 --> 02:36:11.480]  Stop censoring conservatives.
[02:36:14.040 --> 02:36:18.840]  Stop Jack Dorsey. Stop the bias. We are not Russian bots. We are conservatives,
[02:36:18.840 --> 02:36:23.080]  Jack Dorsey. You were caught as a president before it is too late, because Jack Dorsey is
[02:36:23.080 --> 02:36:28.040]  trying to influence the election, to sway the election so that the Democrats can steal the
[02:36:28.040 --> 02:36:31.640]  election. That is why he is censoring and shadow banning conservatives.
[02:36:31.640 --> 02:36:56.380]  Well, let's start here. So, you saw her Roth deed when PBS picked up, you could hear the
[02:36:56.380 --> 02:37:00.700]  rest of the media ran with that one, but he's saying you're basically chattel cattle.
[02:37:00.700 --> 02:37:03.840]  He's up there saying get this woman out of here and they're saying four to five, nine
[02:37:03.840 --> 02:37:08.280]  to nine, they're sitting there literally saying you're like an animal and that's how they
[02:37:08.280 --> 02:37:10.280]  see us.
[02:37:10.280 --> 02:37:14.040]  Well, yeah, and then it was just really upsetting because then conservatives only heard the
[02:37:14.040 --> 02:37:19.440]  audio that CNN essentially they cut my audio. And so even Paul Joseph Watson tweeted something
[02:37:19.440 --> 02:37:24.480]  like, Oh, well, Laura Loomer interrupted the hearing to complain about being unverified.
[02:37:24.480 --> 02:37:29.000]  And I was like, actually, no, that's not what happened. I didn't complain about being unverified.
[02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:34.560]  I was standing up for all conservatives, but you only heard that at that part of the audio
[02:37:34.560 --> 02:37:38.600]  because they literally cut my audio. I mean, you just compared the different versions.
[02:37:38.600 --> 02:37:42.600]  That's the version they played on TV. And they completely ignored the video where my
[02:37:42.600 --> 02:37:48.200]  audio is clear and you can see that my voice is actually overpowering his voice. So when
[02:37:48.200 --> 02:37:53.040]  they said, Oh, well, this protest or this crazy girl, this, this like white supremacist
[02:37:53.040 --> 02:37:56.860]  Nazi protest or Laura Loomer, even though I was like literally wearing a star David
[02:37:56.860 --> 02:38:01.840]  necklace during the hearing and you were there, you saw it, they, they lied. And it was because
[02:38:01.840 --> 02:38:06.640]  they wanted to make me look stupid, but my voice is very loud and my voice overpowered
[02:38:06.640 --> 02:38:07.640]  his.
[02:38:07.640 --> 02:38:11.960]  Well, that's it. And look, this is what they do. This is how they deceive. It's like I
[02:38:11.960 --> 02:38:16.280]  say, Hillary's killed children in Iraq and Afghanistan funding ISIS. And they go, Joan
[02:38:16.280 --> 02:38:21.680]  says that she killed kids in a pizza place. So their deception never ends. But let's get
[02:38:21.680 --> 02:38:26.760]  back to the medical records document Keith Ellison's physical and emotional abuse,
[02:38:26.760 --> 02:38:32.080]  the female accused of your article and video is up on big league politics.com. That's really
[02:38:32.080 --> 02:38:37.640]  a big deal. How the left steadfastly ignores Islamic abuse, particularly I was having lunch
[02:38:37.640 --> 02:38:43.240]  yesterday with a former federal officer and some other folks. And he was telling me about
[02:38:43.240 --> 02:38:49.720]  this big undercover famous sting he did for three years selling tractor trailers, a cigarette
[02:38:49.720 --> 02:38:56.200]  stolen cars, you name it, uh, to the Muslim brotherhood basically. And he was saying the
[02:38:56.200 --> 02:39:03.680]  craziest part was every Muslim family he worked with ran topless bars and ran hookers. And
[02:39:03.680 --> 02:39:07.160]  basically the whole family would have sex for these women. And then they would also
[02:39:07.160 --> 02:39:11.240]  get underage women. And it was just showing, but they weren't going after him for the underage
[02:39:11.240 --> 02:39:15.120]  women. They're going after him for the money laundering to the Middle East. And then the
[02:39:15.120 --> 02:39:20.640]  left just goes, Oh no, the grooming, the thousands of missing girls in England, thousands per
[02:39:20.640 --> 02:39:24.400]  town being raped as young as five years old. And the police will do nothing because they
[02:39:24.400 --> 02:39:29.040]  go, they're Muslims. They're allowed to. So it's literally the culture in the Middle
[02:39:29.040 --> 02:39:34.480]  East and here that Muslims are allowed to be pedophiles. Well, it's, it's not even
[02:39:34.480 --> 02:39:38.320]  just the pedophilia, but it's like the 36 versions. People think of a virgin. A virgin
[02:39:38.320 --> 02:39:42.720]  means a young girl. Sorry, go ahead. Yeah, but it's also just the fact that the Democrats
[02:39:42.720 --> 02:39:47.160]  are literally giving a pass to jihadis running for office. And when I say that the left accuses
[02:39:47.160 --> 02:39:51.040]  me of being an Islamophobe and a bigot. Well, first of all, like there's no such thing as
[02:39:51.040 --> 02:39:54.920]  Islamophobe. I am Islamophobic. I am afraid of, I mean, I can't go to one of those countries
[02:39:54.920 --> 02:39:59.920]  and be a Christian. I'll be killed. I am absolutely afraid of that. That's my point is that I'm
[02:39:59.920 --> 02:40:04.280]  afraid of black widows. I'm afraid of rattlesnakes. I'm afraid of tornadoes. I am a tornado
[02:40:04.280 --> 02:40:09.400]  phobe. I am a pedophile phobe. I am a cancer phobe. I am a car wreck phobe. I am a heart
[02:40:09.400 --> 02:40:15.400]  attack phobe. I'm a tyranny phobe. I'm an Islamophobe. Yeah, no, exactly. And so that's
[02:40:15.400 --> 02:40:18.960]  what they don't seem to understand is that this was a term that was was created by the
[02:40:18.960 --> 02:40:23.600]  Muslim Brotherhood when they started infiltrating the United States in the 1960s when they first
[02:40:23.600 --> 02:40:27.680]  created the Muslim Students Association, right? Because the Muslim Brotherhood, a lot of people
[02:40:27.680 --> 02:40:31.480]  think this is a conspiracy theory, but they actually have a plan to take over the world
[02:40:31.480 --> 02:40:36.400]  and take over the United States. It's called the explanatory memorandum. In 2004, the FBI
[02:40:36.400 --> 02:40:40.120]  raided a home in Anandale, Virginia, and they discovered documents from one of the legal
[02:40:40.120 --> 02:40:44.760]  scholars from the from the Muslim Brotherhood. And it's a it's a step it's a step by step
[02:40:44.760 --> 02:40:49.200]  plan. It has five steps and they're in stage four. You mean Islam wants to take over the
[02:40:49.200 --> 02:40:53.320]  world? That's like the state of gold. Well, yes, but the Muslim Brotherhood specifically
[02:40:53.320 --> 02:40:58.160]  targeted the United States as being the ideal place for an Islamic takeover. So this is
[02:40:58.160 --> 02:41:02.320]  not a conspiracy theory. This is not me being hateful, a bigot, whatever you want to call
[02:41:02.320 --> 02:41:07.520]  me, Google the explanatory memorandum and read it word by word. I mean, it's going
[02:41:07.520 --> 02:41:10.760]  to blow your mind. You're going to see that they have a plan to honestly take over this
[02:41:10.760 --> 02:41:14.920]  country and they describe how they want to infiltrate political institutions, how they
[02:41:14.920 --> 02:41:18.200]  want to have candidates, Muslim candidates run for office. They want to indoctrinate
[02:41:18.200 --> 02:41:22.960]  your kids. They want to get involved with the media. And Europe's 10 years ahead of
[02:41:22.960 --> 02:41:27.600]  us, they do that at every major of the Netherlands. They marched Germany. They marched little
[02:41:27.600 --> 02:41:35.640]  kids in and make them bow to Allah every week. They're doing this here in the United States
[02:41:35.640 --> 02:41:39.520]  as well. And then when I do my exposes on these jihadis running for office, who have
[02:41:39.520 --> 02:41:44.280]  actually made pledges to Muslim Brotherhood, like Abdul al-Said, who's running for governor
[02:41:44.280 --> 02:41:50.960]  in Michigan. He lost because of me. But then you have Rashida Tlaib, who won her primary
[02:41:50.960 --> 02:41:56.840]  in Michigan. She literally assaulted me on camera. This Muslim politician who supports
[02:41:56.840 --> 02:42:02.560]  Hamas and has publicly said that she thinks that Israel should be eradicated. She assaulted
[02:42:02.560 --> 02:42:07.840]  me and gets away with it because she's a Muslim, right? Ilhan Omar, a Somalian immigrant, gets
[02:42:07.840 --> 02:42:12.320]  to trash-talk America on the 4th of July, marries her brother so he can get a green
[02:42:12.320 --> 02:42:20.840]  card, supports female genital mutilation, supports the payment of a return policy to
[02:42:20.840 --> 02:42:21.840]  the government.
[02:42:21.840 --> 02:42:23.160]  I understand. So in closing, Laura, what's going to happen to Keith Ellison as these
[02:42:23.160 --> 02:42:29.000]  reports come out of him brutalizing women? Well, it's up to the people to really demand
[02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:32.760]  that the DNC holds him accountable. If the people put enough pressure on the DNC and
[02:42:32.760 --> 02:42:36.840]  the mainstream media to actually do something, then maybe something will actually happen.
[02:42:36.840 --> 02:42:41.520]  But we need to get behind Doug Wardlow, his opposition, his Republican challenger, support
[02:42:41.520 --> 02:42:45.520]  Doug Wardlow, however you can, if you live in Minnesota, vote for him. But we really
[02:42:45.520 --> 02:42:50.480]  just need to call the DMC. And on my, if you go to my Twitter, I created a call where people
[02:42:50.480 --> 02:42:54.320]  can actually call the DMC and leave a message. It's all right. Great job. We'll be back with
[02:42:54.320 --> 02:43:00.320]  more calls. Thank you, Laura.

[02:46:59.200 --> 02:47:27.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide
[02:47:27.320 --> 02:47:39.160]  is Alex Jones coming up next segment. We're going to play the videos. It just broke. It's
[02:47:39.160 --> 02:47:47.080]  on info wars.com. Generation being born now is the last to be free says Assange in last
[02:47:47.080 --> 02:47:54.680]  interview before blackout. He said AI world government is here. Everything you do will
[02:47:54.680 --> 02:48:02.560]  now be assimilated. Let's read what he actually says the generation being born now is the
[02:48:02.560 --> 02:48:13.120]  last free generation. You are born and either immediately or then a year you are known globally.
[02:48:13.120 --> 02:48:18.120]  Your identity is one form or another coming as a result of your idiotic parents plastering
[02:48:18.120 --> 02:48:23.440]  your name and photos all over Facebook or as a result of insurance applications or passport
[02:48:23.440 --> 02:48:31.160]  applications is known to all major world powers. He went on to say once these systems
[02:48:31.160 --> 02:48:37.160]  are all in place humans will be obsolete and AI run by major government corporations will
[02:48:37.160 --> 02:48:44.800]  control your life. Same thing I'm saying same thing Elon Musk is saying. Why are we saying
[02:48:44.800 --> 02:48:50.240]  the same thing? Because the globalist planned it this way. Just like Paul's latest video
[02:48:50.240 --> 02:48:54.800]  we hear last hour the first hour where the zombie apocalypse is here the smartphones
[02:48:54.800 --> 02:49:00.600]  are lowering IQ making you depressed making you alone making you unhealthy. What are you
[02:49:00.600 --> 02:49:06.720]  going to do about it? As a small child now in some sense has a negotiations relationship
[02:49:06.720 --> 02:49:12.160]  with all the major world powers. It puts us in a very different position very few technically
[02:49:12.160 --> 02:49:17.520]  capable people are able to live apart to choose a little apart to choose to go their
[02:49:17.520 --> 02:49:23.960]  own way at it. It smells a bit like totalitarianism in some way. The capacity to collect and process
[02:49:23.960 --> 02:49:30.240]  information about people with the growing exponentially will become to grow faster and
[02:49:30.240 --> 02:49:35.200]  faster he's stated. With advancements in applying artificial intelligence to big data the next
[02:49:35.200 --> 02:49:40.960]  logical step is coming. Look at the way Google and others in Amazon and Facebook are doing
[02:49:40.960 --> 02:49:46.000]  they're basically open cut harvesting the knowledge of humankind as we express it when
[02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:50.720]  we communicate with each other. This classical model which people in academia call surveillance
[02:49:50.720 --> 02:49:58.000]  capitalism. But they're using it to subvert the public. It's a really important and severe
[02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:03.080]  economic change which is to take the surveillance capitalism model and transform it instead
[02:50:03.080 --> 02:50:10.880]  into a model that does not yet have a name. Actually it's called the B system. An AI model
[02:50:10.880 --> 02:50:15.800]  which is to use the vast reservoir to train artificial intelligence of different kinds
[02:50:15.800 --> 02:50:21.720]  that replace not only intermediary sectors vertical integration. Most things you do internet
[02:50:21.720 --> 02:50:28.760]  in a sense more efficient and intermediation but will take over the transport sector or
[02:50:28.760 --> 02:50:37.800]  create whole new sectors. You see that total consolidation the end of humans. Doug Hagman
[02:50:37.800 --> 02:50:41.080]  is coming up but we really should play these clips. We're downloading the videos right
[02:50:41.080 --> 02:50:50.360]  now. We posted the excellent RT article in full to infowars.com and newswars.com.
[02:50:50.360 --> 02:50:58.680]  Meanwhile behind the facade of this interesting looking bookstore we have Bill Gates. What's
[02:50:58.680 --> 02:51:03.560]  the exact quote? Meanwhile behind the facade of this innocent looking bookstore. Bill Gates
[02:51:03.560 --> 02:51:12.120]  the threat of a disease X global pandemic is very real. How long did we warn you that
[02:51:12.120 --> 02:51:16.080]  he's preparing the mass global plague to bring in world government? Because that's what he
[02:51:16.080 --> 02:51:20.080]  studies is what his real research is. It's what he admitted decades ago in PBS he was
[02:51:20.080 --> 02:51:27.160]  planning. It's what his father did. It's who he is. It's why he was chosen as a top technocrat
[02:51:27.160 --> 02:51:33.120]  because he will steadfastly and studiously like a good little attack dog deliver this
[02:51:33.120 --> 02:51:38.040]  plan into place. The dumbing down on the population, the vertical integration, the database control
[02:51:38.040 --> 02:51:42.920]  system, the consolidation. He's working with Bloomberg. He's working with the Rothschilds.
[02:51:42.920 --> 02:51:46.600]  He's working with the British Empire. He's working with the globalist to bring in this
[02:51:46.600 --> 02:51:52.680]  unholy system of total brainwashing and total control attacks on the family, breaking up
[02:51:52.680 --> 02:52:00.480]  of the family, the systematic destruction of independence. It is a nightmare situation.
[02:52:00.480 --> 02:52:04.440]  They say the likelihood is the UN's been saying of an explosive global pandemic breaking out
[02:52:04.440 --> 02:52:08.800]  in the relative linear future increases along the population in the world's poorest countries,
[02:52:08.800 --> 02:52:13.400]  which are presently experiencing explosive population growth, even as birth rates develop
[02:52:13.400 --> 02:52:20.800]  world plummet. So Gates points out real problems, but then they have the solution open the borders
[02:52:20.800 --> 02:52:26.680]  to the third world. Don't actually bring in first world systems to reduce population.
[02:52:26.680 --> 02:52:31.480]  Just let there be a giant people bomb and then a huge incendiary war that comes out
[02:52:31.480 --> 02:52:36.840]  of it because Bill Gates and others could have fixed this problem long before it happened,
[02:52:36.840 --> 02:52:41.920]  but they haven't done that. They simply want to point out the problem. They themselves
[02:52:41.920 --> 02:52:49.360]  have helped disaster bait. I know we've got loaded phone lines here. Let's talk to Bob
[02:52:49.360 --> 02:52:54.840]  in Tennessee. Bob, you're on the air. Thanks for holding. Go ahead, Alex. We're really
[02:52:54.840 --> 02:52:59.440]  proud of you and you have a brilliant audience. Love your products. Use a ton of them. Hey,
[02:52:59.440 --> 02:53:05.840]  briefly, the premise of the Kavanaugh thing starts with women are incapable of lying.
[02:53:05.840 --> 02:53:11.280]  So ask any man who's gone through family court whether or not woman is capable of lying to
[02:53:11.280 --> 02:53:16.080]  curry favor with the court. Let's just say I have seen women with a greater
[02:53:16.080 --> 02:53:24.680]  probability to lie in my life. I imagine you have. Anyway, I very much appreciate you.
[02:53:24.680 --> 02:53:29.640]  I can't tell you how much I appreciate you out there. Well, all I know is I love this
[02:53:29.640 --> 02:53:34.720]  thing when she's a Democratic Party operative, an abortion company operative, this big leftist,
[02:53:34.720 --> 02:53:37.920]  and then we're just supposed to believe it. And now she won't show up for the hearing.
[02:53:37.920 --> 02:53:43.880]  That shows that even though they waited until the last minute, this isn't going over well.
[02:53:43.880 --> 02:53:48.280]  What do you think is going to happen? Personally, I think this is going to blow up in their faces.
[02:53:48.280 --> 02:53:51.600]  I think it's already starting to unravel on them. That's my feeling on this.
[02:53:51.600 --> 02:53:58.280]  Why do you think Bill Gates is talking about disease X and wiped out billions?
[02:53:58.280 --> 02:54:09.240]  You know, I think their maniacal grasp for control is all they focus on. I think that
[02:54:09.240 --> 02:54:15.400]  will fail too, but I see people that are willing to give into it.
[02:54:15.400 --> 02:54:19.720]  I totally agree with you, Bob. Thanks for the call. Yeah, I don't want to say women are inherently
[02:54:19.720 --> 02:54:23.720]  evil creatures or humans are, but the Bible says we all are. And I find women are very,
[02:54:23.720 --> 02:54:28.560]  very nice, but they're not the quote physically stronger of the sexes. So men are more likely
[02:54:28.560 --> 02:54:35.920]  to kill or to hit somebody or steal. Women are more likely to poison you or lie about
[02:54:35.920 --> 02:54:39.760]  you when they get in that position. That's what they tend to do.
[02:54:39.760 --> 02:54:47.240]  And it is a well-known phenomenon. I have personally experienced it, just 100% pure lies, and you're
[02:54:47.240 --> 02:54:55.040]  just sitting there, hearing stuff that has no place in reality. But I found men do it
[02:54:55.040 --> 02:54:59.880]  too, especially in this modern culture. It's like, he's with Trump, so you can do whatever
[02:54:59.880 --> 02:55:03.640]  you want to him. And then once they've been trained to lie about Trump or his associates
[02:55:03.640 --> 02:55:07.520]  or his supporters, now the pressure that sets a lot about everybody. It's really a scary
[02:55:07.520 --> 02:55:14.680]  place to be. But it's not having as much power anymore because people know. Let's go ahead
[02:55:14.680 --> 02:55:17.520]  and go to Paul in Colorado. Paul, you're on the air.
[02:55:17.520 --> 02:55:24.360]  Hey, Alex. Welcome from the great state of Colorado, high on the Rocky Mountains in Grand
[02:55:24.360 --> 02:55:25.360]  County.
[02:55:25.360 --> 02:55:30.120]  Very, very beautiful area there in Colorado. What's on your mind?
[02:55:30.120 --> 02:55:36.440]  Just a couple of things that I would like to see Kavanaugh do, or actually his lawyers,
[02:55:36.440 --> 02:55:42.040]  is I would like to see them go out and gather every bit of information that they can find
[02:55:42.040 --> 02:55:52.080]  on this woman, save some of the really good stuff for later, publish a whole bunch of
[02:55:52.080 --> 02:56:01.960]  stuff, completely discredit her, and then sue her for libel and slander.
[02:56:01.960 --> 02:56:06.120]  He could definitely do that. I mean, my big thing is, if the Democrats are involved, which
[02:56:06.120 --> 02:56:12.800]  they admit they are, it's proven to be false. It's organized crime. It's racketeering. It's
[02:56:12.800 --> 02:56:19.280]  perjury. And so that's really where the real meat and potatoes are, in my view.
[02:56:19.280 --> 02:56:24.720]  It won't be perjury until they get people under oath saying it.
[02:56:24.720 --> 02:56:29.400]  No, no, I understand. That's why I think they need to haul her before Congress. I don't
[02:56:29.400 --> 02:56:33.360]  think you can't just make the allegation, then I'll show up in court. You made the allegation.
[02:56:33.360 --> 02:56:36.120]  You're getting subpoenaed. You're going to come into court. You're going to say it all.
[02:56:36.120 --> 02:56:39.520]  You're going to sit right there at Kavanaugh and say, you did this to me. And then we're
[02:56:39.520 --> 02:56:43.320]  going to put up on screen pictures of her running around like a crazy woman at high
[02:56:43.320 --> 02:56:48.000]  school and say, we all heard you were in the sewing club. And all this was going on. But
[02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:52.160]  there you are saying you got blackout drunk. Don't remember ever what happened. Were you
[02:56:52.160 --> 02:56:55.720]  at the event with the male strippers in high school? We're, you know, I mean, this is some
[02:56:55.720 --> 02:56:56.880]  wild stuff.
[02:56:56.880 --> 02:57:04.040]  Now, probably what'll happen is that she will, she will take the fifth on everything. And
[02:57:04.040 --> 02:57:12.560]  that'll be, that'll be very convenient. But I don't see this delaying anything because
[02:57:12.560 --> 02:57:17.160]  first off, she's not going to show up. And even if she is subpoenaed, she still won't
[02:57:17.160 --> 02:57:20.040]  show up. She'll risk a contempt to Congress.
[02:57:20.040 --> 02:57:24.400]  Now, I hear you're right. We're going to come back for a moment and a few more calls, but
[02:57:24.400 --> 02:57:30.640]  I totally forgot to cover this today. Remember Trump on Monday or Tuesday said we're going
[02:57:30.640 --> 02:57:35.440]  to release all the secret FISA documents, everything? The FBI so belligerent they're
[02:57:35.440 --> 02:57:40.360]  saying, no, we're not doing it. That's right. They're ignoring the president's order now
[02:57:40.360 --> 02:57:45.440]  because it's going to burn them good at Clinton Cabal.
[02:57:45.440 --> 02:57:50.320]  Next to we were selling it for about three years and then they found out how big it was
[02:57:50.320 --> 02:57:53.800]  and I was, we were buying and they said, oh, we want more money, more money. And oh, this
[02:57:53.800 --> 02:57:59.600]  and that. And so I've broken my contract. And right now we can't get more of this proprietary
[02:57:59.600 --> 02:58:03.600]  ingredient that goes in next to it. It literally is so pure that if you put in a peager dish
[02:58:03.600 --> 02:58:09.520]  on top of 90 degree hot plate, it gasses like I dream of genie and it's purple gas. I mean,
[02:58:09.520 --> 02:58:13.160]  that is so pure. It just goes right into your body when you take it. We're working on trying
[02:58:13.160 --> 02:58:18.560]  to get other suppliers right now, but I bought a huge amount of it, ordered it six months
[02:58:18.560 --> 02:58:22.480]  ago. So I get the price down and I said, if you don't lower it, I'm done. I'm breaking
[02:58:22.480 --> 02:58:27.320]  the contract. Well, I broke the contract last week. And so this is potentially the last
[02:58:27.320 --> 02:58:32.280]  run. In fact, right now it is the last run of survival shield X2. And we've got a good

[03:00:05.520 --> 03:00:12.520]  You know, we're under such attack that Stephen Colbert, still has a big audience compared
[03:00:20.920 --> 03:00:25.320]  to most mainstream media, attacks me every week. I don't even have time to watch it for
[03:00:25.320 --> 03:00:30.740]  shows like Homeland based on me or any of this. But I see callers, Stephen Colbert late
[03:00:30.740 --> 03:00:36.880]  night attacks Infowars Alex Jones. Who knows what he did? I mean, it's just crazy. And
[03:00:36.880 --> 03:00:43.240]  all I'm doing is exposing these people. And then separately, we've got so many other big
[03:00:43.240 --> 03:00:46.800]  things that are happening, like the Chinese Communist takeover, the fact that they own
[03:00:46.800 --> 03:00:52.360]  Hollywood, the fact they're the ones muscling in. It's just crazy to see the average American
[03:00:52.360 --> 03:00:56.640]  opposing Trump when clearly he's an American president trying to turn the country around.
[03:00:56.640 --> 03:01:00.720]  It just makes me very, very sad. But then I see him trying to derail Cabin on. I see
[03:01:00.720 --> 03:01:05.520]  that starting to unravel, starting to, starting to really fall apart. That is a good feeling.
[03:01:05.520 --> 03:01:11.360]  But then you ask, how are they so crazy to take a lady with this many skeletons in her
[03:01:11.360 --> 03:01:15.520]  closet and try something like this? At the start of the next segment, I've got part of
[03:01:15.520 --> 03:01:19.160]  the Assange interview where he comes out and says, people being born now are the last
[03:01:19.160 --> 03:01:23.720]  free generation. And I think it's already passed that quite frankly, but admitting how
[03:01:23.720 --> 03:01:26.960]  bad of straights we're in, we can actually fix it. I'll play some of that before Doug
[03:01:26.960 --> 03:01:31.440]  Hagman takes over. We're going to get that latest Stephen Colbert piece as well. But
[03:01:31.440 --> 03:01:35.120]  finishing up here, I'm trying to go as many of these calls as I can. Who's been holding
[03:01:35.120 --> 03:01:39.800]  the longest here? Alex in Michigan, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[03:01:39.800 --> 03:01:47.080]  Alex Jones. It's good to talk to you again, sir. We are Alex Jones. We are Julian Assange.
[03:01:47.080 --> 03:01:52.840]  Thanks for exposing the Skynet program launching in China, where the, you know, the robots
[03:01:52.840 --> 03:01:59.920]  are taking over Julian Assange. I'm just talking about it now. We are the resistance. I use
[03:01:59.920 --> 03:02:06.520]  the products. Everyone should go to infowithshore.com. Get the Survival Shield X2. I've been using
[03:02:06.520 --> 03:02:15.760]  that like four years. And it's pretty awesome. I take it every day. But the Chinese Illuminati,
[03:02:15.760 --> 03:02:22.000]  I love how you talk about that. Sometimes the history with the Rockefellers, you know,
[03:02:22.000 --> 03:02:27.760]  taking over and then they export the fluoride hydrofluorosalistic acid there, put it in
[03:02:27.760 --> 03:02:33.000]  our water to dumb us down. And, you know, great job, Alex. What can I say?
[03:02:33.000 --> 03:02:36.320]  No, brother, you're doing a great job. But what's frustrating is it's all admitted.
[03:02:36.320 --> 03:02:41.280]  And you see the big think tanks and John P. Holdren saying, put fluoride in the water
[03:02:41.280 --> 03:02:46.280]  to lower their IQs. And then they do it. And they're just such evil jerks. They're so
[03:02:46.280 --> 03:02:53.360]  cold-blooded. I know. It's like, why can't they just, you know, let us be and have us
[03:02:53.360 --> 03:02:58.280]  run our own lives? You know, people talk about, you know, states rights. I think, you know,
[03:02:58.280 --> 03:03:02.920]  individual rights is what it comes down to, you know, and medical freedom and the right
[03:03:02.920 --> 03:03:07.960]  to choose what's in our own bodies. And I choose to have the InfoWare's products in
[03:03:07.960 --> 03:03:10.960]  my body because I'm trying to fight these globalists.
[03:03:10.960 --> 03:03:15.240]  Well, I can tell you X2, unfortunately, it's our last run of it. And the specialist to
[03:03:15.240 --> 03:03:20.120]  be in this weekend is 25% off. It's amazing. And again, just having good eye on your body
[03:03:20.120 --> 03:03:25.920]  versus the bad halogens is night and day. God bless you, Alex. I appreciate your call.
[03:03:25.920 --> 03:03:32.000]  Let's talk to Dina in California. Dina, thanks for holding her on the air. Welcome.
[03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:37.600]  So I'm bare with me, please. My brain's kind of scattered. But, you know, I'm very new
[03:03:37.600 --> 03:03:44.720]  to politics. I actually never voted until 2016. There was no way I was going to let Hillary
[03:03:44.720 --> 03:03:48.960]  in. No way, you know. And so I've been trying to learn more about politics since it's
[03:03:48.960 --> 03:03:52.960]  happened. And I cannot believe what's going on in the world. I mean, a lot of people don't
[03:03:52.960 --> 03:03:58.040]  see it. And first of all, I think that that lady is protagonist is lying through her teeth.
[03:03:58.040 --> 03:04:03.200]  Okay. And I think they're pressuring her to say whatever. You know, now they're hiding
[03:04:03.200 --> 03:04:06.720]  her out. I mean, who knows? Maybe she's dead. Like, whatever, people already killed off
[03:04:06.720 --> 03:04:07.720]  her.
[03:04:07.720 --> 03:04:10.880]  No, I agree. It looks like pressuring the fact that they set it for her. And now she
[03:04:10.880 --> 03:04:13.600]  doesn't want to testify. It looks like they're pushing her.
[03:04:13.600 --> 03:04:17.920]  Oh, yeah, definitely. You know, they're threatening her. You know, it's all said, she's just
[03:04:17.920 --> 03:04:21.960]  here for now. She's supposedly has death threats against her. But she's a death threat. It's
[03:04:21.960 --> 03:04:27.720]  also the Democrat Party. You know, first of all, I had a few things that I want to say.
[03:04:27.720 --> 03:04:30.720]  Honestly, I was trying to call you all morning and I didn't think I was going to get through
[03:04:30.720 --> 03:04:36.160]  right now. And, you know, I do have a constant issues, brain constant issues, but like, you
[03:04:36.160 --> 03:04:40.720]  know, my thoughts just gathered, you know, I am a single woman in California. I'm on
[03:04:40.720 --> 03:04:44.800]  that society. I'm just ready to move to Texas, though, you know, and I wanted to ask you
[03:04:44.800 --> 03:04:46.520]  guys how you felt about Texas.
[03:04:46.520 --> 03:04:50.160]  Well, we welcome you to Texas. Doug Hagman's coming up, sweetheart. I'm glad you got in,
[03:04:50.160 --> 03:04:54.840]  but I got to get to this key piece right ahead.
[03:04:54.840 --> 03:04:59.960]  Fueling your body is hard work. That's why we've introduced the Info Wars Life Daily

[03:06:20.440 --> 03:06:29.200]  We will post the full interview to InfoWars.com. Generation being born now is the last to be
[03:06:29.200 --> 03:06:34.160]  free. We're being prepared for AI takeover and for humans to be obsolete. That's what
[03:06:34.160 --> 03:06:38.000]  I'm saying. It's what Elon Musk is saying. It's because the globalists are building a
[03:06:38.000 --> 03:06:43.480]  world to do this. The full interview is up on InfoWars.com. RT did the interview. It's
[03:06:43.480 --> 03:06:49.080]  the last interview he did before the total news blackout. And this is what's happening.
[03:06:49.080 --> 03:06:54.320]  We have to be aware. The technology is being designed and being deployed to take control
[03:06:54.320 --> 03:06:59.000]  of human development. We'll air a few minutes of this and turn the baton over to Doug Hagman
[03:06:59.000 --> 03:07:03.120]  who's always got a lot to break down. And then again, on InfoWars.com, we will post
[03:07:03.120 --> 03:07:09.440]  on our own servers the full interview because this is very important. Here's some of it.
[03:07:09.440 --> 03:07:17.680]  He leaves to solve a very interesting problem to me, which was to know the fate of man.
[03:07:17.680 --> 03:07:24.800]  Know the fate of mankind in so far as that development of man is revealed by the development
[03:07:24.800 --> 03:07:30.160]  of his institutions and how they actually behave in practice internally. And the great
[03:07:30.160 --> 03:07:36.560]  political struggle of mankind in so far as it's been rational and we all know politics
[03:07:36.560 --> 03:07:42.040]  is largely irrational. But the irrational part I feel is sort of random. And the rational
[03:07:42.040 --> 03:07:47.600]  part is based on what we know, what we know about ourselves or we know about each other
[03:07:47.600 --> 03:07:52.360]  and what we know about how human resources are distributed and how human institutions
[03:07:52.360 --> 03:07:58.960]  behave and what sort of internal and external rules we engage in. So that's the purpose
[03:07:58.960 --> 03:08:06.920]  of WikiLeaks to try and understand mankind. And then from that we can perhaps produce
[03:08:06.920 --> 03:08:14.920]  a better or more realistically put less, worse human civilization.
[03:08:14.920 --> 03:08:23.520]  But that's changing. Mankind in some sense, just having a small glimmer of understanding
[03:08:23.520 --> 03:08:32.360]  about how it is progressing through the world, I think is now almost completely eliminated
[03:08:32.360 --> 03:08:37.520]  and not in the way that I expected. We actually have access to much more knowledge about how
[03:08:37.520 --> 03:08:42.600]  we worked than we ever did before. But it's been eliminated through the speed of informational
[03:08:42.600 --> 03:08:49.480]  processing and therefore the speed of the change of knowledge. And that is rapidly moving
[03:08:49.480 --> 03:08:59.680]  into that algorithmic processing of knowledge is moving into artificial intelligence. And
[03:08:59.680 --> 03:09:05.960]  why artificial intelligence is just another kind of algorithm. I think the scale changes
[03:09:05.960 --> 03:09:14.000]  that have occurred in the last seven years are significant enough to classify it as a
[03:09:14.000 --> 03:09:27.320]  qualitative change. And that qualitative change means a very serious threat to the stability
[03:09:27.320 --> 03:09:35.600]  of human civilizations, not that they should be too stable. And the ability for human beings
[03:09:35.600 --> 03:09:40.360]  to organize their fate in intelligence.
[03:09:40.360 --> 03:09:44.280]  We're going to fade down there. I'm going to turn over to Doug Hagman, but I want just
[03:09:44.280 --> 03:09:48.040]  to preface, we're going to put the whole interview up on infowars.com with my introduction
[03:09:48.040 --> 03:09:55.240]  here because the power structure wants to bring AI in to cut out the general public
[03:09:55.240 --> 03:09:59.840]  and to cut out crowdsourcing and to cut out the will of the people. So it's being directed
[03:09:59.840 --> 03:10:05.140]  in a very authoritarian way. And so it's making us all obsolete and because of the acceleration
[03:10:05.140 --> 03:10:09.640]  of knowledge and because the acceleration of computing and because it's now being removed
[03:10:09.640 --> 03:10:18.040]  out of the human realm, it's almost like they're speeding up the time space continuum to a level
[03:10:18.040 --> 03:10:24.640]  that we don't even live in or compete with. And so making ourselves obsolete by a creation
[03:10:24.640 --> 03:10:29.600]  we're making that is basically an artificial dimension within the third dimension that
[03:10:29.600 --> 03:10:36.600]  is programmable and directable by the prime controllers who are a bunch of ruthless sociopathic
[03:10:36.600 --> 03:10:41.600]  and psychopathic grandchildren of robber barons and Nazis.
[03:10:41.600 --> 03:10:50.240]  And so then you see the true directed evil that is happening into the average sociopath
[03:10:50.240 --> 03:10:54.560]  doesn't realize that even they themselves are going to be cut out of the system. We have
[03:10:54.560 --> 03:10:59.720]  no future. We have no no chance. So again, Doug Hagman is about to take over. We will
[03:10:59.720 --> 03:11:04.800]  post the entire powerful Assange interview generation being born. Now is the last to
[03:11:04.800 --> 03:11:08.960]  be free. I hope people send this out to their friends and family because it is very, very
[03:11:08.960 --> 03:11:16.960]  important. It's not gloom and doom. It's admitting our Promethean moment, our Atlantean moment
[03:11:16.960 --> 03:11:25.560]  of not being God's yet, but getting God like power because we're made the image of God.
[03:11:25.560 --> 03:11:29.080]  If you want to support the broadcast and support your own family and support your own life
[03:11:29.080 --> 03:11:38.320]  and opt in through energy, through currency, through support of us, you, you are funding
[03:11:38.320 --> 03:11:42.120]  true revolutionary understanding this pro human and you're getting products that are
[03:11:42.120 --> 03:11:46.560]  just as revolutionary and just as strong, whether it's bio tricillinium from the mustard seed,
[03:11:46.560 --> 03:11:50.200]  the best you're going to find out there, 40% offer. X2, very close to selling out our
[03:11:50.200 --> 03:11:54.560]  last run, still 25% off throughout the weekend. Please take advantage of that. We're super
[03:11:54.560 --> 03:12:00.160]  female or super male volatility, 50% off even though that's our last run of that. And let's
[03:12:00.160 --> 03:12:06.560]  appear breeze, which already leading competitors are $500 to $600. It's normally $200 for stage
[03:12:06.560 --> 03:12:13.440]  ion filter. It's $50 off right now. So that's $149. You cannot beat that deal in full or
[03:12:13.440 --> 03:12:20.520]  store.com and fourslife.com or AAA 253-3139. I believe in human destiny. I believe in you
[03:12:20.520 --> 03:12:26.800]  making choices for yourself and you're being removed from that right now. And then those
[03:12:26.800 --> 03:12:32.000]  of us that try to build humanity up and those of us that try to get people to think about
[03:12:32.000 --> 03:12:37.200]  more complex issues, the establishment doesn't go, Oh, let's welcome them. No, let's block
[03:12:37.200 --> 03:12:41.480]  them. Let's keep people in a trance. Let's keep them dumb. And for me, that's the greatest
[03:12:41.480 --> 03:12:46.400]  crime of the globalist is they claim humanity's obsolete, but there's some of the most obsolete
[03:12:46.400 --> 03:12:50.960]  twisted people out there. And they and their families are some of the most twisted, unhappy
[03:12:50.960 --> 03:12:55.520]  people out there. But then they want to project their loathing onto us and say, as soon as
[03:12:55.520 --> 03:13:00.040]  we're all gone, well, then this new beautiful future can move forward. That sounds like
[03:13:00.040 --> 03:13:06.000]  something the devil said a long time ago in the Garden of Eden. So that's what that comes
[03:13:06.000 --> 03:13:12.440]  down to. Again, big developments at info wars.com. It looks like the Kavanaugh situation is derailing
[03:13:12.440 --> 03:13:15.960]  from the Democrats, but they've always got curveballs they can throws will be covering
[03:13:15.960 --> 03:13:19.200]  that more later. I want to thank you all for your support and listening. Remember, if you
[03:13:19.200 --> 03:13:23.600]  spread the articles, the videos, you tell folks what the live shows will continue to
[03:13:23.600 --> 03:13:28.040]  be able to fight in the face of this onslaught. But if you can't back us up, it's basically
[03:13:28.040 --> 03:13:34.360]  you giving up because the enemy sees us as a symbol that if they can crush info wars,
[03:13:34.360 --> 03:13:38.960]  they can crush all the opposition. So we are that standard in the battle and they can take
[03:13:38.960 --> 03:13:43.640]  down that eagle. I'm not bragging. It's just they see us as the eagle. If they can seize
[03:13:43.640 --> 03:13:47.920]  the eagle, they believe they've won. So hold up that eagle folks. Now let's go to Doug
[03:13:47.920 --> 03:13:52.480]  Hagman of his great work at Hagman report. Thank you for joining us. Thanks for taking
[03:13:52.480 --> 03:13:58.440]  over. Thank you so much, Alex. You know, it's amazing. You and I had crossed without knowing
[03:13:58.440 --> 03:14:05.400]  a cross pass in Washington, D.C. When you were there at Cats Capital Hill, I was there
[03:14:05.400 --> 03:14:10.000]  as well. And we just didn't see each other. And of course, I spent this past weekend with
[03:14:10.000 --> 03:14:15.720]  David Knight and Owen Shroyer. So it's interesting that our paths are parallel and crossing at
[03:14:15.720 --> 03:14:24.360]  the same time. Tell us what you got coming up. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry about that delay there.
[03:14:24.360 --> 03:14:30.560]  Coming up, I've got some breaking news about the, well about the Kavanaugh situation. This
[03:14:30.560 --> 03:14:35.320]  from a different slant, a different take at the bottom of the hour here going to be talking
[03:14:35.320 --> 03:14:43.520]  with a guy that actually is the host of WNTK in New Hampshire knows a lot about the Kavanaugh
[03:14:43.520 --> 03:14:48.360]  situation and about really what this is all about. But previous to that, I'm going to
[03:14:48.360 --> 03:14:53.600]  be touching upon the declassification that's kind of took has taken a backseat right now.
[03:14:53.600 --> 03:15:02.120]  declassification of documents that President Donald Trump is doing and the reason the communists
[03:15:02.120 --> 03:15:07.680]  or Democratic socialists slash communists are running scared because I do believe that
[03:15:07.680 --> 03:15:13.800]  Donald Trump has set some traps within those documents and the media is about to be exposed
[03:15:13.800 --> 03:15:16.960]  as are the Democratic socialists about to be exposed for what they are. That's coming
[03:15:16.960 --> 03:15:22.160]  up after this break. And now I want to thank you so much for allowing me to guest host
[03:15:22.160 --> 03:15:26.920]  folks who are listening to the info wars. We're up against the break, but I will say

[03:20:28.760 --> 03:20:34.200]  Wars and support Info Wars. This segment I want to just discuss a little bit. It's been
[03:20:34.200 --> 03:20:39.240]  a while since I sat in for Alex. Interestingly enough, right before the break, I was talking
[03:20:39.240 --> 03:20:44.880]  to Alex about being in Washington DC at the same time he was. And it's interesting because
[03:20:44.880 --> 03:20:52.000]  we, that is the new media, I feel that we are making a difference that we are acting
[03:20:52.000 --> 03:20:58.760]  as your voice, the voice of the people to the administration, appealing to the Donald
[03:20:58.760 --> 03:21:03.360]  Trump administration, appealing to the people, the white hats in the Trump administration
[03:21:03.360 --> 03:21:05.000]  about the banning and censorship.
[03:21:05.000 --> 03:21:10.480]  And I know that you've all heard about this and your, a lot of people grow tired of hearing
[03:21:10.480 --> 03:21:15.760]  about it, but I'll tell you that we are speaking for you because once we are silenced, you're
[03:21:15.760 --> 03:21:21.400]  next and if you're next, you've got no voice. So this past, not this last weekend, but the
[03:21:21.400 --> 03:21:31.040]  week before, myself and Joe, my son, we were in Washington DC. I've got a couple of images.
[03:21:31.040 --> 03:21:37.280]  We were there for a specific purpose that was to, we were at Radio Rowe at the Federation
[03:21:37.280 --> 03:21:41.960]  for American Immigration Reform. We were honored to be there, but the other part of that is
[03:21:41.960 --> 03:21:49.640]  we were able to gain White House press access and we visited the White House. That was again,
[03:21:49.640 --> 03:21:55.520]  the same time Alex was there on Capitol Hill, we were able to visit the White House and
[03:21:55.520 --> 03:22:03.680]  make some inroads, some contacts there. Interestingly enough, talking with people within certain
[03:22:03.680 --> 03:22:09.000]  elements of certain departments of the administration, talking about the censorship issue, talking
[03:22:09.000 --> 03:22:15.320]  about the banning of new media, talking about how we are being treated and of course the
[03:22:15.320 --> 03:22:25.680]  ominous implications that has. And now, talking with the individuals there within the administration,
[03:22:25.680 --> 03:22:31.120]  they understand and I do believe that we have made some significant progress into bringing
[03:22:31.120 --> 03:22:39.080]  our case to the administration. That's not to say that we've won anything, but it is
[03:22:39.080 --> 03:22:45.480]  to say that we've certainly made the case that we are being victimized, we being the
[03:22:45.480 --> 03:22:51.760]  conservative base being victimized, the base that elected President Trump being victimized
[03:22:51.760 --> 03:22:59.840]  by the, of course, by the banning of the social networks and social networking itself. While
[03:22:59.840 --> 03:23:05.960]  there, we stood actually at the remarkable experience of standing on the South lawn of
[03:23:05.960 --> 03:23:10.200]  the White House near the Rose Garden. In fact, there's a picture of the Rose Garden watching
[03:23:10.200 --> 03:23:16.360]  Marine One come in land and watching President Donald Trump get off a board Marine One and
[03:23:16.360 --> 03:23:21.480]  take off from the White House. There he is there, if you're looking at the screen, boarding
[03:23:21.480 --> 03:23:27.600]  Marine One. And it was a magnificent sight and the sight that certainly humbled me to
[03:23:27.600 --> 03:23:33.800]  see that to be in the presence of truly a great man and just a great experience.
[03:23:33.800 --> 03:23:41.120]  And having said that, also, we were also there to discuss the problem of illegal alien immigration,
[03:23:41.120 --> 03:23:45.400]  illegal aliens in the United States. And this is key. I wanted to cover this very quickly
[03:23:45.400 --> 03:23:51.200]  here because this is something that is near and dear to my heart. While in Washington,
[03:23:51.200 --> 03:23:56.800]  D.C., while at the Federation for American Immigration Reform, Radio Row, while we were
[03:23:56.800 --> 03:24:04.240]  one of actually 63 news agencies or radio hosts that were on Radio Row at Capitol Hill
[03:24:04.240 --> 03:24:11.680]  there, we were discussing the problem of illegal aliens in the United States. And the facts
[03:24:11.680 --> 03:24:20.120]  that we learned, nothing new to you, the listeners, but the facts that we learned were, to me,
[03:24:20.120 --> 03:24:26.280]  so important for everyone to really understand and really get a grip on how bad things are.
[03:24:26.280 --> 03:24:30.880]  Right now, we've got anywhere between 12 and a half to 20 million illegal aliens in
[03:24:30.880 --> 03:24:36.880]  the United States. We've got nearly, well, about 1.7 million illegal alien minors and
[03:24:36.880 --> 03:24:41.240]  about 4.2 million U.S. citizens and children of illegal aliens or anchor babies. That's
[03:24:41.240 --> 03:24:51.000]  the kind of encapsulated extent of the problem. But while we were there, we had the honor.
[03:24:51.000 --> 03:24:59.800]  And I break up when I talk about this. My son and I had interviewed a number of families
[03:24:59.800 --> 03:25:10.800]  whose lives were torn apart by crimes committed by illegal aliens. The incredible women, mothers
[03:25:10.800 --> 03:25:19.200]  and fathers of these victims of the criminal activity of illegal aliens in this country.
[03:25:19.200 --> 03:25:26.600]  And when we sat and we talked with these moms whose children were taken by the criminals
[03:25:26.600 --> 03:25:34.280]  in this country, it's worse than you can imagine. It's heartbreaking. It's incredible.
[03:25:34.280 --> 03:25:42.120]  Kellyanne Conway spoke at a recent, or at a rally held by the parents of the victims.
[03:25:42.120 --> 03:25:47.400]  And there is a picture of Kellyanne Conway, who we were able to meet with, and there she
[03:25:47.400 --> 03:25:53.000]  is there, speaking at a rally on Capitol Hill on behalf of illegal aliens, or on behalf
[03:25:53.000 --> 03:25:57.920]  of the victims of illegal aliens, criminal activity there. And in speaking with her,
[03:25:57.920 --> 03:26:04.480]  of course, about this problem, we were assured by the Donald Trump administration that they
[03:26:04.480 --> 03:26:11.080]  would, in fact, push forward against the wishes of the Democratic socialists to take this
[03:26:11.080 --> 03:26:17.320]  problem and to fix the problem of the illegal immigrants and the crime related to the illegal
[03:26:17.320 --> 03:26:20.040]  immigrants in the United States.
[03:26:20.040 --> 03:26:23.480]  The reason I wanted to bring this up today is I believe that this is so important because
[03:26:23.480 --> 03:26:30.280]  people talk about the separation of children at the border. It's not that. The real separation
[03:26:30.280 --> 03:26:35.920]  are the children that are forever separated from their families. And you know that, we
[03:26:35.920 --> 03:26:42.040]  know that. But to bring it even more forward when you speak to, when we spoke to these
[03:26:42.040 --> 03:26:47.200]  families and we understood what they have gone through. And when we heard the numbers,
[03:26:47.200 --> 03:26:50.840]  it's worse and even worse than we were led to believe.
[03:26:50.840 --> 03:26:54.680]  The top five states, I just want to make sure everyone knows, the top five states with the
[03:26:54.680 --> 03:27:01.240]  highest number of illegal alien populations, California with 2.6 million, Texas with 1.9
[03:27:01.240 --> 03:27:06.320]  million. I'm rounding the numbers, by the way, Florida with a million, New York with
[03:27:06.320 --> 03:27:15.040]  872,700 approximately, and New Jersey with 565,000. The annual national fiscal cost of
[03:27:15.040 --> 03:27:20.200]  illegal immigration is 116 billion. This is the cost out of our pocket. And when you
[03:27:20.200 --> 03:27:25.240]  look at the annual average annual tax deficit per legal alien adult, you're looking at about
[03:27:25.240 --> 03:27:28.200]  11 grand that we've got to cover per year.
[03:27:28.200 --> 03:27:35.760]  So it's more than just the fiscal deficit and the dollar amount. It does involve the
[03:27:35.760 --> 03:27:39.840]  separation, permanent separation of families and the crimes, especially with this. That,
[03:27:39.840 --> 03:27:44.000]  of course, leads to the border wall. And there are promises that have been made by
[03:27:44.000 --> 03:27:49.640]  Kennedy, Donald Trump that are being fulfilled but stymied yet by the Democratic Socialists
[03:27:49.640 --> 03:27:54.120]  in this country, as well as some Rhino-Republicans. We addressed that and we were sure that that
[03:27:54.120 --> 03:28:03.720]  was going to be accelerated here in the upcoming weeks, months ahead as we near the midterms.
[03:28:03.720 --> 03:28:07.640]  On the other side of the break here, I've got a very special guest that's going to join
[03:28:07.640 --> 03:28:13.200]  me, Keith Hansen. Keith Hansen from WNTK. He's a wildly conservative talk show host
[03:28:13.200 --> 03:28:17.520]  up in New Hampshire. We're going to be talking about a number of things, topically speaking
[03:28:17.520 --> 03:28:23.920]  about the Kavanaugh hearing. He's got a little different take on the Kavanaugh hearings and
[03:28:23.920 --> 03:28:31.600]  the accusations against Mr. Kavanaugh by Ms. Ford. And that's on, believe me, this is on
[03:28:31.600 --> 03:28:36.800]  everyone's mind or this is on everyone's discussion. It's going to be, you're going
[03:28:36.800 --> 03:28:40.320]  to want to listen to this. You're going to want to call a friend and tune in to this
[03:28:40.320 --> 03:28:46.400]  next couple of segments with Keith Hansen and myself as I sit in for Alex Jones. Again,
[03:28:46.400 --> 03:28:53.280]  Doug Hagman, HagmanReport.com, in for Alex Jones, can break back today with us.
[03:28:53.280 --> 03:28:56.920]  I tried other brands, but I came back to my sunshine.
[03:28:56.920 --> 03:29:01.640]  For the best hot or cold pain relief, get the best. Get a Sunny Bay heating pad.
[03:29:01.640 --> 03:29:06.640]  Sometimes life can be a pain in the neck or back or shoulder.
[03:29:06.640 --> 03:29:11.200]  And the best relief for that pain is a Sunny Bay heating pad. Did you know that the American
[03:29:11.200 --> 03:29:16.320]  College of Physicians said that one of the best ways to treat muscle pain is heat therapy?

[03:34:06.960 --> 03:34:13.360]  I've got the pleasure of hosting for Alice Jones, fourth hour, and the final hour of the broadcast.
[03:34:13.360 --> 03:34:20.720]  And I asked a good friend of mine, a good friend of the Hagman Report to come on as a guest because
[03:34:21.280 --> 03:34:26.800]  in speaking with him today, he's got a very unique perspective. What's on everyone's mind today?
[03:34:26.800 --> 03:34:34.480]  What's everyone talking about? It's the Kavanaugh hearings and the attempted sabotage of Brett
[03:34:34.480 --> 03:34:42.880]  Kavanaugh by this one female accuser. And if they could find more, they'd drag more out.
[03:34:42.880 --> 03:34:47.280]  But he's got a very interesting and much different take than most. Now, our guest,
[03:34:47.280 --> 03:34:53.760]  again, Keith Hansen. Keith Hansen is the top conservative talk show host out of New Hampshire,
[03:34:53.760 --> 03:35:00.720]  WNTK.com. You can follow him on Twitter at ReelKeithHansen. That's H-A-N-S-O-N,
[03:35:00.720 --> 03:35:07.680]  S-O-N. Again, ReelKeith Hansen on Twitter, WNTK. That's his home base. He's 6 to 10 a.m.
[03:35:08.320 --> 03:35:12.480]  It's a must listen to in the morning. By the way, it's Eastern Time. Keith, thanks for joining me
[03:35:12.480 --> 03:35:19.040]  today. Doug, thanks so much for having me. It's great to be on the show. Well, and again,
[03:35:19.040 --> 03:35:24.160]  I appreciate this. And the reason I asked you to come on, what's on everyone's dinner talk right
[03:35:24.160 --> 03:35:29.200]  now is about Brett Kavanaugh and about the Supreme Court nomination, about what the Democratic
[03:35:29.200 --> 03:35:34.080]  Socialists are doing, and even some of the Republicans are doing to sabotage his nomination.
[03:35:34.080 --> 03:35:39.280]  And apparently, it might take us, is there something to delay if not definitely postpone
[03:35:39.280 --> 03:35:44.800]  his nomination? But in our discussion today, you had said some things that really just blew my
[03:35:44.800 --> 03:35:51.680]  mind. It's from a different perspective. No one else is talking about. So I had asked you to come
[03:35:51.680 --> 03:35:58.320]  on. And if you don't mind, please give us your take on what's really taking place with a Kavanaugh
[03:35:58.320 --> 03:36:03.200]  sabotage of the Kavanaugh nomination. I'm going to get myself in a lot of trouble here. Okay,
[03:36:03.200 --> 03:36:09.760]  well, this is basically what it is. It's the Kavanaugh issue is not the issue. The Kavanaugh
[03:36:09.760 --> 03:36:14.400]  issue, what's going on with Kavanaugh and the accusations that were made by this, this Chrissy
[03:36:14.400 --> 03:36:21.680]  Ford, these are, this is a symptom of a bigger problem. And the bigger problem is the culture
[03:36:21.680 --> 03:36:27.360]  that we have seen ever since the women's lib movement has really taken root. What's happening
[03:36:27.360 --> 03:36:33.520]  right now is you have a culture where binge drinking and sexual promiscuity is at an all-time high.
[03:36:34.080 --> 03:36:37.840]  And it's been, it's been growing. It's been growing in popularity. One of the things I talked
[03:36:37.840 --> 03:36:42.720]  about in my program this morning was if you recall back in the mid 90s, you could not turn on a
[03:36:42.720 --> 03:36:48.720]  television show after eight o'clock at night and not be bombarded with advertisements for
[03:36:48.720 --> 03:36:54.800]  the girls gone wild videos. Now, what was girls gone wild for people who are uninitiated in this?
[03:36:54.800 --> 03:37:02.880]  Well, it was a video at DVD or VHS tapes of women with absolutely no, I don't even want to say
[03:37:02.880 --> 03:37:10.160]  women. We're talking girls, 18, 19, 20 year old college girls who are inebriated beyond the point
[03:37:10.160 --> 03:37:18.400]  of making rational decisions. And they're videotaped stripping, literally having lesbian sex with one
[03:37:18.400 --> 03:37:27.440]  another while strangers are videotaping this at nightclubs, at beach resorts, in spring break
[03:37:27.440 --> 03:37:33.680]  cities. That was one of the big things was girls gone wild, spring break. How much debauchery can
[03:37:33.680 --> 03:37:39.600]  you possibly catch on film? And this is part of the feminist movement in this country. Don't tell
[03:37:39.600 --> 03:37:45.440]  me what I can do with my body. Don't tell me how I can dress. I want to be free to do whatever it
[03:37:45.440 --> 03:37:51.120]  is that I want to do whenever it is that I want to do it. And the end result is what we're seeing
[03:37:51.120 --> 03:38:01.440]  here today. And it's very interesting that the yearbooks from Ford's school, the Holton Arms
[03:38:01.440 --> 03:38:08.880]  School, specifically, they called their yearbook title scribe. So the years that would be relevant
[03:38:08.880 --> 03:38:15.200]  to Christine Blasey Ford would be scribe 82, scribe 83, and scribe 84. And if you look at
[03:38:15.200 --> 03:38:19.520]  these, if you actually had screenshots of them now, because they've all been scrubbed from the
[03:38:19.520 --> 03:38:25.600]  internet, what you're going to find is a group of high school kids, primarily the girls who were
[03:38:25.600 --> 03:38:33.200]  entrenched in this culture of binge drinking and promiscuous sex. Okay, which, and I remember
[03:38:33.200 --> 03:38:39.520]  that time. I vividly remember that time. And of course, scantily clad, as you indicated,
[03:38:39.520 --> 03:38:45.200]  as spring break parties everywhere. Well, of course, it wasn't limited to spring break. But
[03:38:45.760 --> 03:38:53.760]  so what are you saying? Are you saying that it's Ford? I mean, exactly, because we're getting
[03:38:53.760 --> 03:38:59.200]  some dangerous around here, right? Are we not? Well, dangerous, dangerous in terms of dangerous
[03:38:59.200 --> 03:39:04.720]  in terms of what that dare I potentially shame a victim, where I say that you can't dress like a
[03:39:04.720 --> 03:39:10.240]  slut and behave like a slut. And then if something allegedly happens, that that you suddenly have
[03:39:10.240 --> 03:39:16.320]  recalled, yeah, it's exactly what I'm saying. I was exactly like the moral decay, the moral decay
[03:39:16.320 --> 03:39:22.800]  in this country today is beyond anything that that that we have seen. And this attitude today
[03:39:22.800 --> 03:39:28.160]  that I can do what I want when I want, I can dress how I want. And I'll tell you, I was in the
[03:39:28.160 --> 03:39:31.840]  nightclub business, you know this, I was in the nightclub business for a number of years. I used
[03:39:31.840 --> 03:39:37.760]  to host bachelorette parties. And I've seen bachelor parties, and I've been to bachelor parties,
[03:39:37.760 --> 03:39:42.800]  and I've hosted bachelorette parties. And I'll tell you something, the bachelorette parties
[03:39:42.800 --> 03:39:48.160]  that take place with with 20 something girls who are sending one of their girlfriends off
[03:39:48.880 --> 03:39:54.480]  to the to the altar to be to be married. These these are activities. This is a night of debauchery
[03:39:54.480 --> 03:40:03.280]  that would make a Seventh Avenue whore blush. My goodness. So, okay, so you're you're looking
[03:40:03.280 --> 03:40:08.320]  at this from a really, I have not heard anyone else talking about this, or at least to that extent,
[03:40:08.320 --> 03:40:17.040]  you're looking at this as really a moral problem. More more so than anything else,
[03:40:17.040 --> 03:40:22.000]  you're you're you're hearing it correctly. It's a moral problem. There's no question about it. But
[03:40:22.000 --> 03:40:26.880]  this is a moral problem that now spills over into a variety of different aspects of society.
[03:40:27.440 --> 03:40:32.800]  But this is this is a situation based upon based upon what is what is being published
[03:40:32.800 --> 03:40:39.840]  in in in these volumes of this this scribe, the scribe 82, scribe 83 and scribe 84. What you see
[03:40:39.840 --> 03:40:44.800]  is a a group, you know, it really if the shoe were on the other foot, and I and I saw this
[03:40:44.800 --> 03:40:49.440]  written, this is not my original statement. This is something that I saw written. If the
[03:40:49.440 --> 03:40:53.680]  roles were reversed and Christine Blasey Ford had been nominated for the Supreme Court by President
[03:40:53.680 --> 03:40:58.720]  Trump, the headline by the air fingers quote resistance would read Christine Blasey Ford
[03:40:58.720 --> 03:41:04.320]  in the drunken white privilege racist playgirls of Holton Arms. That's exactly what this is.
[03:41:04.960 --> 03:41:12.160]  Okay. Oh, wow. Yeah, I can I can I can almost I can almost hear the dinging of the emails coming
[03:41:12.160 --> 03:41:18.640]  in right now. But you know, I think your points are valid here. You're looking at a culture of
[03:41:18.640 --> 03:41:25.440]  promiscuity, a culture of permissiveness that in my view has been ignored by by the media. And
[03:41:25.440 --> 03:41:34.240]  of course, we're seeing this now. And so well, this is this is the coming to fruition of this
[03:41:34.240 --> 03:41:38.240]  is the maturity and the coming to fruition of seeds that were planted back in the 80s.
[03:41:38.240 --> 03:41:41.840]  And unfortunately, this is this is something that happens time and time and time again.
[03:41:42.480 --> 03:41:46.960]  You know, we see this on college campuses. In fact, tomorrow on my on my radio show,
[03:41:46.960 --> 03:41:52.800]  I have Stuart Taylor, Jr. Stuart is the co author of a book called The Campus Rape Frenzy,
[03:41:52.800 --> 03:41:57.440]  the attack on due process on American universities. And this ties into a much bigger issue.
[03:41:57.440 --> 03:42:03.680]  This is as they said, this is not about Kavanaugh and Ford per se. This is basically this is this
[03:42:03.680 --> 03:42:13.040]  is one page in a very, very thick book of the end result of the culture of promiscuity that we see
[03:42:13.040 --> 03:42:17.760]  today with with young people. And this campus rape frenzy is a perfect example of this. You
[03:42:17.760 --> 03:42:22.160]  have, you know, girls, there's no such thing as dating anymore. Let's let's look at it from this
[03:42:22.160 --> 03:42:28.720]  perspective. And going back to the 80s and in the 90s and the morality has shifted. There's no
[03:42:28.720 --> 03:42:35.600]  question about it. But the there's no more dating today anymore. People go out, they especially
[03:42:35.600 --> 03:42:41.680]  on college campuses, they go to a party, they drink for the purposes of drinking as much as they
[03:42:41.680 --> 03:42:48.640]  possibly can. I hate to do this. They hold that thought. We have a break here on the other side.
[03:42:48.640 --> 03:42:51.520]  You can finish that thought. Keith Hansen is my guest.

[03:44:59.600 --> 03:45:04.240]  we were buying and they said, oh we want more money, more money and oh this and that and so I've
[03:45:04.240 --> 03:45:10.240]  broken my contract and right now we can't get more of this proprietary ingredient that goes in X2
[03:45:10.240 --> 03:45:15.840]  that literally is so pure that if you put in a picker dish on top of 90 degree hot plate it gasses
[03:45:15.840 --> 03:45:20.240]  like I dream of genie and it's purple gas. I mean that is so pure it just goes right into your
[03:45:20.240 --> 03:45:25.280]  body when you take it. We're working on trying to get other suppliers right now but I bought a huge
[03:45:25.280 --> 03:45:30.720]  amount of it, ordered it six months ago, so I get the price down and I said if you don't lower it,
[03:45:30.720 --> 03:45:35.920]  I'm done, I'm breaking the contract. Well I broke the contract last week and so this is potentially
[03:45:35.920 --> 03:45:41.360]  the last run, in fact right now it is the last run of survival shield X2 and we've got a good
[03:45:41.360 --> 03:45:46.480]  supply of it, it'll be gone a couple months. X2, if you haven't experienced it, InfoWarsStore.com,
[03:45:46.480 --> 03:45:50.320]  if you have experience, you know how great it is, I suggest you stock up on it. It's available right

[03:45:58.080 --> 03:46:03.760]  Years ago, InfoWarsLife created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[03:46:03.760 --> 03:46:08.400]  As the years went on and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to
[03:46:08.400 --> 03:46:13.520]  create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health. MycoZX Plus is the result of
[03:46:13.520 --> 03:46:18.240]  the search for that formula, a unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural
[03:46:18.240 --> 03:46:23.040]  cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms. There's no better product to help your body fight back.
[03:46:23.040 --> 03:46:28.320]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract
[03:46:28.320 --> 03:46:32.880]  and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked. Powered by an
[03:46:32.880 --> 03:46:38.320]  impressive list of ingredients including grapefruit seed extract, poudarko bark and grape seed extract,
[03:46:38.320 --> 03:46:43.360]  our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test of time as powerful micro balancing
[03:46:43.360 --> 03:46:48.880]  properties. Pick up a bottle of the new and improved MycoZX Plus today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:46:48.880 --> 03:46:50.560]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:46:50.560 --> 03:47:20.480]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show. Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones.
[03:47:21.280 --> 03:47:30.320]  Doggy Hagman sitting in for Alex Jones in this final segment. Guest or guest,
[03:47:30.960 --> 03:47:37.120]  so glad to be joined by Keith Hansen. Keith Hansen is the host of the wildly popular Keith
[03:47:37.120 --> 03:47:45.760]  Hansen show WNTK.com. There's six to ten, actually two shows in there, but visit WNTK.com and
[03:47:45.760 --> 03:47:53.120]  at real Keith Hansen, that's at real Keith Hansen on Twitter. I'm talking frankly about the
[03:47:53.840 --> 03:47:58.560]  Kavanaugh situation, about the Ford situation and about what's really happening. You hear
[03:47:58.560 --> 03:48:04.160]  about the Lewinsky tactics. You hear about that. That's discussion, obviously. That's the normal
[03:48:04.160 --> 03:48:10.320]  discussion. That's the accepted discussion, of course, in polite companies, shall we say.
[03:48:10.320 --> 03:48:17.760]  But what's the real reason? Are the chickens, the cultural chickens coming home to roost now
[03:48:17.760 --> 03:48:24.320]  that we've gone through this degradation of our moral faculties over the past three, four,
[03:48:24.320 --> 03:48:30.160]  decades, five decades? Is that the case? Keith Hansen appears to think that is, and I tend to
[03:48:30.160 --> 03:48:34.880]  agree with him. And by the way, folks, he's going to be on The Hagman Report tonight. Of course,
[03:48:34.880 --> 03:48:38.560]  The Hagman Report here is 7 to 10 p.m. Eastern on the Global Star Radio Network. Just go to
[03:48:38.560 --> 03:48:42.640]  The Hagman Report.com. Two ends on the Hagman. But he's going to be talking more about this
[03:48:42.640 --> 03:48:46.720]  this evening. But I really want him to finish this because this is something I think is so
[03:48:46.720 --> 03:48:54.480]  important. The moral fabric of our country has been torn down, has been rendered. And I think
[03:48:54.480 --> 03:48:57.680]  Keith is on to something. Keith, thanks for holding over on the break. Thanks for your gift
[03:48:57.680 --> 03:49:05.200]  of time. Keep going, brother, with this area that's not being talked about in the mainstream media at
[03:49:05.200 --> 03:49:12.160]  all. Doug, I don't know if you can hear me or not. I'm having some audio issues here. I cannot
[03:49:12.160 --> 03:49:19.280]  hear you at all. So I don't know where we are here. Okay. Can you hear me now? Let's do it this
[03:49:19.280 --> 03:49:29.120]  way. I don't know if we can get any volume into Keith. All right. Keith, if you can hear me,
[03:49:29.120 --> 03:49:35.680]  just continue your... Okay, we're going to troubleshoot. In the meantime, folks, visit infowarstore.com.

[03:49:58.160 --> 03:50:03.440]  All right. We have Keith back. And sorry about that little technical difficulty, but I was just
[03:50:03.440 --> 03:50:08.960]  saying, Keith, before, as you couldn't hear me, everyone talks about the Linsky tactics being
[03:50:08.960 --> 03:50:12.560]  used, but no one's talking about the real issue of the moral degradation that we've seen over the
[03:50:12.560 --> 03:50:18.640]  last 50 years or so. And this is part of the, if not really the problem. So I'd like you to
[03:50:18.640 --> 03:50:24.160]  continue your thought that you had right before the break. Well, I mean, ultimately, like I said,
[03:50:24.160 --> 03:50:30.000]  what this boils down to is this is a multifaceted issue. But when you look at the moral decay,
[03:50:30.000 --> 03:50:33.920]  the moral decline of our society today, the empowerment of women to do whatever it is that
[03:50:33.920 --> 03:50:40.560]  they want to do, behave however it is they want to without consequence. But then if somebody does
[03:50:40.560 --> 03:50:47.680]  anything that is perceived to subjugate or oppress that individual who is simply uniquely
[03:50:47.680 --> 03:50:52.880]  expressing themselves, well, then that person becomes the criminal. That person becomes the
[03:50:52.880 --> 03:50:59.200]  villain. And the insidious thing about this is that it undermines the integrity of the system
[03:50:59.200 --> 03:51:04.080]  that we have in place, the judicial system that we have in place. You and I were in DC last week
[03:51:04.080 --> 03:51:07.920]  and standing in front of the Supreme Court building, there's on the facade of that building,
[03:51:07.920 --> 03:51:13.760]  equal justice under law. We have a constitution. We have constitutional rights. There are
[03:51:13.760 --> 03:51:18.720]  processes that are extended to people who find themselves caught up in the criminal justice
[03:51:18.720 --> 03:51:25.040]  system due process, the right to face one's accuser, the evidentiary burdens of burdens of
[03:51:25.040 --> 03:51:31.360]  proof that must be met and who has the responsibility of meeting that burden of proof before a person
[03:51:31.360 --> 03:51:38.560]  can be convicted of a crime in a court of law. Political correctness and now this concept of
[03:51:40.160 --> 03:51:47.440]  allegations being made and the allegation being tried and convictions and sentences being levied
[03:51:47.440 --> 03:51:54.080]  in the court of public opinion is completely undermining the constitutional rights that every
[03:51:54.080 --> 03:52:02.080]  American citizen has the right to an expectation to. If somebody makes the accusation like this,
[03:52:02.080 --> 03:52:08.240]  this Christine Blasey Ford makes the accusation and by making the accusation, the court of public
[03:52:08.240 --> 03:52:15.760]  opinion has its day in court and it convicts and sentences that person to a lifetime of shame,
[03:52:15.760 --> 03:52:21.680]  a lifetime of scorn, losing their job, losing their livelihood, having that scarlet letter put
[03:52:21.680 --> 03:52:27.920]  on them before a court of law would ever have an opportunity to hear that case. And at that point,
[03:52:27.920 --> 03:52:33.440]  well, listen, what are you going to do? Take away my dignity by convicting me in court? Great.
[03:52:33.440 --> 03:52:38.240]  I've already lost my family. I've already lost my job. I've already lost my livelihood. And like
[03:52:38.240 --> 03:52:42.400]  Kavanaugh, this is something, whether or not he's guilty, whether or not he's innocent,
[03:52:42.400 --> 03:52:49.520]  the court of public opinion based upon, let's put it this way, this drunken slut and her word,
[03:52:50.560 --> 03:52:54.400]  that's already convicted him and passed its sentence on him.
[03:52:54.400 --> 03:52:57.840]  And so now for the rest of his life, he's going to have to live with this,
[03:52:57.840 --> 03:53:00.720]  whether or not he gets the Supreme Court seat or he doesn't.
[03:53:03.200 --> 03:53:08.640]  Keith, do you think that was the intent or do you think that this is just merely the
[03:53:08.640 --> 03:53:15.840]  end result or the consequence of her accusations? I mean, because to me, this smacks a lot like
[03:53:16.880 --> 03:53:24.240]  that question, when did you stop beating your wife or the accusation of calling someone a pedophile,
[03:53:24.240 --> 03:53:30.080]  for example, when there's no basis, in fact, for it. It's a stain regardless of its veracity.
[03:53:30.080 --> 03:53:41.680]  So in your eyes, was this a tactic or was this just a consequence of what was
[03:53:42.800 --> 03:53:47.920]  or just merely exploited? This was exploited. I don't know. I mean,
[03:53:48.560 --> 03:53:52.400]  you can take this a couple of different ways. Listen, it was politically expedient. This woman
[03:53:52.400 --> 03:53:57.520]  is now asking the FBI to investigate something that, let's be honest, is not within the FBI's
[03:53:57.520 --> 03:54:02.240]  purview. There's not a federal crime here. There's not a crime that's crossing over state lines.
[03:54:02.240 --> 03:54:07.040]  It's not in the FBI's purview. Not to mention that, and I haven't heard anybody else talking
[03:54:07.040 --> 03:54:12.400]  about this, but there is this thing called statute of limitations. So the statute of
[03:54:12.400 --> 03:54:17.760]  limitations on this ran out 15 years ago. If it was something that was so important,
[03:54:17.760 --> 03:54:22.480]  if this was something that was so traumatic, then it should have been brought up 20 years ago
[03:54:22.480 --> 03:54:29.360]  or 30 years ago, not right now. And in fact, you know damn well that this was politically
[03:54:29.360 --> 03:54:33.760]  expedient. This was political capital because Dianne Feinstein sat on the report.
[03:54:35.280 --> 03:54:40.640]  So this was stored and it was waited. They waited until it was politically expedient
[03:54:40.640 --> 03:54:46.000]  for them to pull this out because they knew exactly like what happened with Anita Hill and
[03:54:46.000 --> 03:54:50.400]  Clarence Thomas. That's exactly what was going to happen. They're going to bork this guy and
[03:54:50.400 --> 03:54:54.480]  that's become the new thing now. Okay, whenever you're losing the argument,
[03:54:54.480 --> 03:54:57.520]  hurl an accusation of racism. And if that doesn't work,
[03:54:57.520 --> 03:55:01.440]  hurl an accusation of rape or sexual assault. And that's guaranteed to bring them down.
[03:55:03.040 --> 03:55:07.600]  I'll tell you, it's straight talk from a straight talker, our guest is Keith Hansen
[03:55:07.600 --> 03:55:13.520]  at Real Keith Hansen on Twitter, wntk.com, voice of New Hampshire. I got to tell you,
[03:55:14.160 --> 03:55:18.080]  again, this is discussion that we have not heard. You've heard of the Linsky tactics,
[03:55:18.080 --> 03:55:23.280]  you've heard of all that but not in this fashion. And I think it's a very interesting take on this
[03:55:23.280 --> 03:55:28.480]  and I'm going to give you a lot of credit for bringing this up. And your final thoughts on this,
[03:55:28.480 --> 03:55:34.160]  what do you think will happen? Will be the consequence of this? Are we going to see a vote
[03:55:34.160 --> 03:55:39.440]  or are we going to see just a tremendous fallout from this or is this already fallen?
[03:55:39.440 --> 03:55:44.640]  Is this tactic already falling apart? I would like to think that the tactic is falling apart
[03:55:44.640 --> 03:55:49.200]  and that he's going to be confirmed. But honestly, to be honest with you, this is an
[03:55:49.200 --> 03:55:55.280]  ever-changing, this is such a rapidly evolving situation that I really don't know. I don't
[03:55:55.280 --> 03:55:58.480]  know. I would love to be able to say with some degree of confidence that I knew, but
[03:55:59.200 --> 03:56:04.160]  this is really, at this point, it's anybody's guess. What I hope is that, and the bottom line
[03:56:04.160 --> 03:56:08.320]  is this, and I would encourage people to listen to your show tonight because we're going to talk
[03:56:08.320 --> 03:56:12.560]  a lot more about this. We're going to talk about this in the context of the legal concept of fruit
[03:56:12.560 --> 03:56:18.240]  of the poisonous tree. The bottom line is this, that Kavanaugh is the pick of a president who is
[03:56:18.240 --> 03:56:24.000]  determined to have been illegitimate. Just as with the fruit of the poisonous tree, if a police
[03:56:24.000 --> 03:56:30.640]  officer searches a vehicle and finds evidence for a crime, but that evidence is unlawfully obtained,
[03:56:30.640 --> 03:56:34.480]  then that's tainted evidence and it winds up getting thrown out of court. It's a motion to
[03:56:34.480 --> 03:56:39.360]  suppress based on the concept of fruit of the poisonous tree. Similarly, Donald Trump is in
[03:56:39.360 --> 03:56:45.280]  the eyes of progressive Democrats and leftist statists. He is the poisonous tree and anything
[03:56:45.280 --> 03:56:50.800]  that comes from him is necessarily tainted because he was not supposed to have won that election.
[03:56:50.800 --> 03:56:55.440]  So anything, whether it's a cabinet pick, whether it's a Supreme Court pick, whether it's an executive
[03:56:55.440 --> 03:57:00.000]  order, everything that comes from President Donald Trump is illegitimate in the eyes of the
[03:57:00.000 --> 03:57:04.960]  progressive statists. And we have to resist this and we have to be vocal and we have to stop being
[03:57:04.960 --> 03:57:09.680]  afraid that these people are going to ruin our lives and dox this and cause us to lose our jobs.
[03:57:09.680 --> 03:57:13.840]  Dammit, we have voices, we have to use it, and we've got to take this country back because
[03:57:13.840 --> 03:57:19.280]  progressives are killing us. Very well stated. Keith, we have to leave it there. Folks, if you
[03:57:19.280 --> 03:57:24.560]  want more, and I know you do, join Keith Hansen tonight on the Hagman reports of the 10 Eastern
