[00:00.000 --> 00:12.680]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.680 --> 00:22.120]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:22.120 --> 00:30.720]  here we are Thursday the 20th day of January 2011 we'll be live here for the
[00:30.720 --> 00:35.280]  next three hours at least Dr. Jerome Corsi will be joining us coming up in
[00:35.280 --> 00:39.000]  T-minus an hour and a half to get into the bizarre statements of the Governor
[00:39.000 --> 00:44.640]  of Hawaii Abokrambi which been interpreted by many to say they can't
[00:44.640 --> 00:48.600]  find the actual birth certificate but have a record that one was created in
[00:48.600 --> 00:54.240]  1961 he'll be joining us for 30 minutes in the second half of the next hour there
[00:54.240 --> 00:57.720]  is just a ton of incredibly important news I want to go over obviously the
[00:57.720 --> 01:03.520]  House has passed the government takeover of health care they have passed the
[01:03.520 --> 01:09.320]  repeal of that also the news is reporting that the biggest mafia bust in
[01:09.320 --> 01:14.760]  history has netted more than a hundred members of organized crime and it's a
[01:14.760 --> 01:21.560]  bunch of slobs in the photos and video I've seen in blue collar jogging suits
[01:21.560 --> 01:27.800]  if you believe that this is the actual real mafia in this country these are
[01:27.800 --> 01:34.960]  low-level gangsters and this is just another level of the lie back in the
[01:34.960 --> 01:39.120]  40s and even 50s we were told by the head of the FBI Jagger Hoover that
[01:39.120 --> 01:43.400]  La Cosa Nostra was a conspiracy theory he said that in Congress it did not
[01:43.400 --> 01:47.360]  exist because reportedly they had photos of him dressed up like a woman with his
[01:47.360 --> 01:53.200]  boyfriend the deputy director of the FBI and so they were blackmailing him and
[01:53.200 --> 01:56.240]  they said it just doesn't exist and then once they had to admit that it
[01:56.240 --> 02:01.640]  existed because state police and others started busting them themselves the
[02:01.640 --> 02:07.440]  state level they said oh it's only Italians only Italians engage in
[02:07.440 --> 02:12.840]  hereditary crime syndicates no every racial and regional and religious group
[02:12.840 --> 02:17.800]  on the planet has always formed organized crime systems it's called
[02:17.800 --> 02:24.680]  hereditary gangs and this is how humans operate and every major group on this
[02:24.680 --> 02:29.160]  planet it doesn't matter what region what part of the world Africa China the
[02:29.160 --> 02:35.000]  United States Europe Israel that's a Russia Latin America they've all got
[02:35.000 --> 02:39.280]  games and it's always organized around a racial or religious background because
[02:39.280 --> 02:43.160]  that's what binds these groups together but the Italian mafia is a small
[02:43.160 --> 02:52.960]  overall component of this certainly you know bad guys but not one tent is
[02:52.960 --> 02:57.400]  venomous as some of the more murderous mafias out there that put them to
[02:57.400 --> 03:02.240]  shame like the Russian mafia which of course is heavily backed by the Russian
[03:02.240 --> 03:06.600]  government so we're going to be looking at this white washer today the biggest
[03:06.600 --> 03:12.080]  mafia bus of course the big mafia is the syndicated crime syndicate of the
[03:12.080 --> 03:15.960]  banking cartel and that's who really dominates all of this and the other
[03:15.960 --> 03:21.120]  crime syndicates are just bottom feeders compared to that it is the global
[03:21.120 --> 03:24.880]  crime syndicate that steals the trillions a month and that is shoving our
[03:24.880 --> 03:31.040]  world into world government so we're going to be breaking all of that down
[03:31.040 --> 03:38.480]  today as well but we are going to continue also looking at the communist
[03:38.480 --> 03:46.280]  dictators visit who Gentile to the United States we're going to break down
[03:46.280 --> 03:51.560]  also Virginia lawmakers are looking to stop climate change probe and I was
[03:51.560 --> 03:57.560]  listening to radio this morning and heard Fox News reporting that the federal
[03:57.560 --> 04:05.240]  government has withdrawn its support for a climate change report that's been
[04:05.240 --> 04:08.480]  being used it turns out that's fraudulent just like all the other big
[04:08.480 --> 04:15.400]  reports but it isn't stopping the different federal agencies like the
[04:15.400 --> 04:20.720]  energy department and other organizations the environmental protection
[04:20.720 --> 04:24.640]  agency from going into Texas and other states and trying to basically shut down
[04:24.640 --> 04:28.800]  our power plants and there's all these crazy statements we saw it a few days
[04:28.800 --> 04:32.200]  ago from the head of the Goddard Space Center saying China's done a great job
[04:32.200 --> 04:36.080]  on the environment that's why they're going to take over I saw other news
[04:36.080 --> 04:40.080]  articles today saying China is getting tough on the environment and we're not
[04:40.080 --> 04:45.280]  and that's why they're rising it's just a total lie China basically has no
[04:45.280 --> 04:49.640]  environmental rules we have them stacked sky high and that's why we can't
[04:49.640 --> 04:55.880]  compete and it's just a total fraud so that's all coming up as well on the
[04:55.880 --> 04:59.080]  other side and I never got to that fluoride story I mentioned yesterday I'm
[04:59.080 --> 05:03.040]  gonna cover that first this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[05:03.040 --> 05:07.440]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[05:07.440 --> 05:11.480]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[05:11.480 --> 05:15.400]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[05:15.400 --> 05:19.400]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[05:19.400 --> 05:23.960]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[05:23.960 --> 05:27.960]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[05:27.960 --> 05:31.760]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[05:31.760 --> 05:35.360]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[05:35.360 --> 05:39.720]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[05:39.720 --> 05:42.880]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[05:42.880 --> 05:46.560]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[05:46.560 --> 05:52.080]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com
[05:52.080 --> 05:56.880]  remember the government doesn't own the Sun so go to mysolarbackup.com or call
[05:56.880 --> 06:02.840]  1-877-327-0365 you've heard Alex explain how the
[06:02.840 --> 06:06.280]  silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with your self
[06:06.280 --> 06:10.400]  produced colloidal silver solutions yet many are unaware of the entire function
[06:10.400 --> 06:13.640]  of the silver lung system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver
[06:13.640 --> 06:18.800]  solutions anywhere in or on the body my name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the
[06:18.800 --> 06:23.000]  developer of the silver lungs generator not only does the silver lung system
[06:23.000 --> 06:27.200]  produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions it also comes equipped
[06:27.200 --> 06:31.000]  with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver
[06:31.000 --> 06:38.000]  solutions directly to key target areas this includes the eyes ears nose lungs
[06:38.000 --> 06:43.040]  topically to the skin and orally for the digestive system be sure to watch our
[06:43.040 --> 06:49.720]  new seven-minute video tour of the silver lung system at www.silverlungs.com to
[06:49.720 --> 06:53.840]  learn more about how the silver lung system works as well we are always
[06:53.840 --> 06:59.800]  ready to answer any questions you may have that's www.silverlungs.com
[06:59.800 --> 07:03.800]  hi folks this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you
[07:03.800 --> 07:07.360]  about soap not detergents but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the
[07:07.360 --> 07:11.680]  Calvin soap company a family owned and operated American company my family
[07:11.680 --> 07:15.840]  staff friends and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love
[07:15.840 --> 07:19.440]  these products for bath hair laundry and dishes there is nothing like these
[07:19.440 --> 07:23.760]  factory direct big money saving triple concentrated soaps anywhere get a free
[07:23.760 --> 07:29.880]  detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at five star soap
[07:29.880 --> 07:34.200]  dot com or info wars dot com let's talk to the owner of five-star soap Marty
[07:34.200 --> 08:03.320]  Schachter and see what he has to say he's the T-rex of political talk
[08:03.320 --> 08:08.800]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:14.680 --> 08:24.800]  we are live it is Thursday January 20th 2011 I'm still not used to saying 2011
[08:24.800 --> 08:30.480]  by the time I'm accustomed to it will be 20 2012 hard to believe Obama says we
[08:30.480 --> 08:36.160]  welcome China's rise well great if China wasn't authoritarian dictatorial
[08:36.160 --> 08:41.800]  arming itself to the teeth against the US if their top generals weren't an
[08:41.800 --> 08:46.280]  official government publications every week talking about gearing up for war
[08:46.280 --> 08:52.000]  against the US and if our own quote elites the offshore banking cartel
[08:52.000 --> 08:58.240]  wasn't positioning China against us if they weren't openly crowing that China
[08:58.240 --> 09:04.320]  is going to replace the United States as the world superpower after the United
[09:04.320 --> 09:09.640]  States has financed all of this that's the big issue here that's the big
[09:09.640 --> 09:14.440]  problem I get so many emails and see so many comments saying Alex Asia's rioting
[09:14.440 --> 09:18.520]  you know China's got big population problems China's got big rebellion
[09:18.520 --> 09:23.720]  problems China is teetering on the edge of collapse don't worry about them I'm
[09:23.720 --> 09:28.720]  not worried about China I'm worried about the geopolitical stratagem that
[09:28.720 --> 09:33.200]  has been developed openly by Henry Kissinger and others who was on Charlie
[09:33.200 --> 09:37.640]  Rose last night bragging that thanks to the economic crisis the crisis he talked
[09:37.640 --> 09:42.080]  about designing for decades that now people are accepting the new world order
[09:42.080 --> 09:49.560]  now all the countries are getting in line and there's announcements about how
[09:49.560 --> 09:56.640]  $100 trillion of additional credit is needed to save the world economy that
[09:56.640 --> 10:00.600]  means 100 trillion additional to the private banks who then hoard it and use
[10:00.600 --> 10:05.160]  it to buy up the imploding economy this is their takeover plan and every time we
[10:05.160 --> 10:08.040]  do what they say and go along with their banker bailouts and their takeovers
[10:08.040 --> 10:12.480]  things only get worse and then they've got a new solution give them even more
[10:12.480 --> 10:16.200]  power and they've got another solution even more more more more we go back two
[10:16.200 --> 10:22.560]  and a half years ago to October of 2008 they had national polls of 99% they
[10:22.560 --> 10:27.480]  were getting thousand to one phone calls in Congress against what was
[10:27.480 --> 10:31.120]  happening but the Congress was bought and paid for and went ahead with it
[10:31.120 --> 10:37.800]  including many Republicans so we're gonna be going over all of that today a
[10:37.800 --> 10:42.880]  good news house passes health law repeal the bad news is doesn't have that much
[10:42.880 --> 10:46.920]  of a chance in the Senate unless we get serious and introduce the political
[10:46.920 --> 10:51.120]  idea the political narrative that's constitutional that how about we start
[10:51.120 --> 10:59.960]  impeaching members of the Senate how about we start trying to impeach Obama
[10:59.960 --> 11:02.960]  for doing something unconstitutional how about we put this into a
[11:02.960 --> 11:06.880]  constitutional crisis knowing we have the Constitution on our side and force
[11:06.880 --> 11:12.520]  its repeal now before they begin implementing it this year with hundreds
[11:12.520 --> 11:15.640]  and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds last time it was over
[11:15.640 --> 11:21.360]  500 every week scores of new mega companies and other even small companies
[11:21.360 --> 11:24.640]  that have made donations to the Democrats they get exemptions from the
[11:24.640 --> 11:28.840]  health care it's unconstitutional right there it's unfair it's discriminatory
[11:28.840 --> 11:34.240]  my operation as this gets put into place I'm gonna have to get health care and
[11:34.240 --> 11:37.540]  all that means as you come to your employees and say okay here's the
[11:37.540 --> 11:41.080]  federal law I got to pay for half of it you got to pay for half I'm cutting your
[11:41.080 --> 11:45.720]  pay by 25% or more sorry the government says so they're like but we want to buy
[11:45.720 --> 11:49.960]  our own health care or we want to you know go go this route no I'm sorry you
[11:49.960 --> 11:53.280]  don't have a choice and now the government's taking over what type of
[11:53.280 --> 11:59.480]  health care you get and openly setting up the death panels which were
[11:59.480 --> 12:03.800]  unelected bureaucrats decide what your local doctors and and and what your
[12:03.800 --> 12:09.000]  insurance providers are allowed to let the medical care personnel the experts
[12:09.000 --> 12:13.860]  the professionals give you this is what managed care is this is what big
[12:13.860 --> 12:18.480]  government takeover of care is so we're gonna be breaking all of that down
[12:18.480 --> 12:25.160]  today but first I want to get to this report because I mentioned it at the
[12:25.160 --> 12:31.920]  start of the broadcast yesterday and I never got to it and again imagine how
[12:31.920 --> 12:35.040]  much more of this is going on that I'm not aware of or that you're not aware
[12:35.040 --> 12:40.200]  of because I just happened to be on my YouTube channel looking at how many views
[12:40.200 --> 12:44.440]  that special we put out last week a 10 minute report on the government's
[12:44.440 --> 12:48.000]  admission that Sonia fluoride is hurting children after all these decades of
[12:48.000 --> 12:52.600]  denial as the evidence piled up I did a 10 minute report that is very detailed
[12:52.600 --> 12:59.000]  with links and documents showing the sevenfold increase in cancer in men I've
[12:59.000 --> 13:01.520]  always said at least a doubling we actually have the government documents
[13:01.520 --> 13:04.800]  the sevenfold they don't have the documents in front of me I always just
[13:04.800 --> 13:08.400]  kind of lowball it it's an overall tripling if you average men and women
[13:08.400 --> 13:14.240]  together but all the numbers are there it's all linked and I saw a comment on
[13:14.240 --> 13:20.960]  there saying yeah I was watching the local news here in San Jose, California and
[13:20.960 --> 13:25.240]  they said a man went into a house that was being fumigated for insects they
[13:25.240 --> 13:28.920]  only use this for either cockroaches or bed bugs they didn't say what the issue
[13:28.920 --> 13:33.480]  was but a big tent over the house big yellow and black tent with giant warning
[13:33.480 --> 13:38.440]  signs everywhere the people are having it fumigated and the guy said the news
[13:38.440 --> 13:41.960]  didn't mention it but the signs that they pointed out the police said well
[13:41.960 --> 13:45.960]  there's no liability here of the sign said deadly gas don't go in and the guy
[13:45.960 --> 13:51.480]  broke in and was found dead when the exterminators return the next day and in
[13:51.480 --> 13:57.360]  that report on the signs it says fluoride and specifically it's sole
[13:57.360 --> 14:04.120]  furrell fluoride which is just basically an aerosolized form of sodium fluoride
[14:04.120 --> 14:08.920]  which of course is one of the main ingredients in decon rat poison and in
[14:08.920 --> 14:12.400]  many other poisons is just flat-out sodium fluoride you want to see that
[14:12.400 --> 14:18.640]  just search the term fluoride rat poison and you'll see news articles and cutouts
[14:18.640 --> 14:24.800]  of the ingredients on the cans blown up on modern rat poisons and going back
[14:24.800 --> 14:28.400]  over a hundred years also a cockroach poison that they've been using for a
[14:28.400 --> 14:31.640]  long time you just spread out a white powder the main ingredient is sodium
[14:31.640 --> 14:36.600]  fluoride this is what they're putting in our water but the issue here is that
[14:36.600 --> 14:40.840]  this is how deadly fluoride is is this guy went in there and succumbed and died
[14:40.840 --> 14:46.600]  from it okay from fluoride gas and the headline is man dies after house
[14:46.600 --> 14:52.520]  fumigated with same fluoride compound sprayed on food and there you see on
[14:52.520 --> 14:55.760]  the screen if you're watching on prison planet dot TV the simulcast the radio
[14:55.760 --> 15:00.520]  show says sodium fluoride kills roaches crickets water bugs silverfish
[15:00.520 --> 15:10.200]  wr Sweeney MFR ink Salisbury Missouri and it says warning you know if you
[15:10.200 --> 15:14.200]  swallow this it'll kill you it's got a skull and crossbones there you can pull
[15:14.200 --> 15:19.520]  up several other of them that go over that but it says warning maybe fatal if
[15:19.520 --> 15:24.760]  swallowed show there you have it and that particular can of stuff from back
[15:24.760 --> 15:33.600]  in the 50s was 98 cents for a big juicy can of sodium fluoride so what's
[15:33.600 --> 15:38.200]  happening is the social engineers can get away with brazen things back in the
[15:38.200 --> 15:42.920]  50s to say oh here the federal government says sodium fluoride is good
[15:42.920 --> 15:45.680]  for your teeth it's wonderful we're gonna put your water of course we have all
[15:45.680 --> 15:49.520]  the documents and those are linked in the video the 10 minute video where
[15:49.520 --> 15:53.200]  Rockefeller Foundation and others discuss using things like sodium fluoride
[15:53.200 --> 15:57.920]  also adding different chemicals to vaccines to reduce fertility they said
[15:57.920 --> 16:00.880]  well if we totally sterilize everybody they'll notice but if we just
[16:00.880 --> 16:05.320]  incrementally do it they won't notice as much it's like the ambient background
[16:05.320 --> 16:09.560]  noise is just being turned up it's slowly being increased until it comes to a
[16:09.560 --> 16:15.320]  crescendo or a conflagration now this article is very important to get out to
[16:15.320 --> 16:18.440]  people it also has our special 10-minute report that Aaron spent so much time
[16:18.440 --> 16:23.800]  putting together it needs to be seen we can save a lot of people this is
[16:23.800 --> 16:27.960]  something folks can take action on now man dies after house fumigated with
[16:27.960 --> 16:31.920]  same fluoride compounds sprayed on food and that's the other big angle on this
[16:31.920 --> 16:38.880]  there are two kinds of approved derivatives of sodium fluoride being
[16:38.880 --> 16:44.720]  used in agriculture one is added to water and is a surface pesticide sprayed
[16:44.720 --> 16:50.480]  on everything from grapes to soybeans we just across the board it was approved
[16:50.480 --> 16:56.200]  in 2005 and it's being used all over the place and it goes right through the cell
[16:56.200 --> 17:02.560]  walls of the plants and bio accumulates inside the plants then they have this
[17:02.560 --> 17:10.480]  gas this sole furrell fluoride that they haven't been granaries in places where
[17:10.480 --> 17:14.960]  they're having weevil or rat problems they just gas it and it does get into the
[17:14.960 --> 17:23.280]  food trace amounts so this is very very serious people need to know this let's
[17:23.280 --> 17:28.200]  go ahead and play this local news clip that we have screenshots of the video
[17:28.200 --> 17:36.920]  danger fumigation sole furrell fluoride and then there's another name of another
[17:36.920 --> 17:40.440]  derivative of fluoride on it so there's two different types they sprayed in and
[17:40.440 --> 17:45.160]  it's got skull and crossbones on it says do not get anywhere near so let's go
[17:45.160 --> 17:55.680]  ahead and play the video of this and hopefully everybody will take this to
[17:55.680 --> 17:59.680]  heart and and warn their friends and family here it is it's new at 10 KTVU's
[17:59.680 --> 18:04.040]  London Cuesta live in San Jose outside the home on Lanier Lane just south of
[18:04.040 --> 18:08.680]  Tully Road he joins us now with late details on the story Lloyd Frank San Jose
[18:08.680 --> 18:11.320]  police tonight told me they have identified the suspect but they have
[18:11.320 --> 18:15.800]  yet to notify next of kin they say this is not a case of homicide but they are
[18:15.800 --> 18:19.840]  baffled by why would someone enter a house vented for attempted for
[18:19.840 --> 18:25.120]  fumigation and with clearly posted signs warning of the danger we are living
[18:25.120 --> 18:28.600]  here and we should buy I don't know what how the person that in there yeah
[18:28.600 --> 18:31.920]  maybe you know they got investigation award I don't know neighbors say the
[18:31.920 --> 18:36.840]  house had been foreclosed by the bank and was vacant for several months a buyer
[18:36.840 --> 18:42.160]  closed escrow earlier this month and was remodeling the three-bedroom home the
[18:42.160 --> 18:46.880]  fumigation tent went up on Saturday and signs were clearly posted warning of the
[18:46.880 --> 18:51.680]  danger I was kind of strange and I don't know how they I mean the guys that were
[18:51.680 --> 18:58.520]  here for me and I don't know how they they knew that the guy was inside when
[18:58.520 --> 19:03.520]  workers came this afternoon they found the body inside police speculate the
[19:03.520 --> 19:08.280]  victim was either homeless looking for a warm place to spend the night or it was
[19:08.280 --> 19:13.600]  a burglary attempt the man was overcome by the fumigation fumes that's a scare
[19:13.600 --> 19:19.000]  for me as well because I'm I live in here you know and I I really didn't expect
[19:19.000 --> 19:23.360]  that happened here so because it's very quiet you can watch the rest of it up on

[21:31.800 --> 21:34.320]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[21:34.320 --> 21:35.680]  I believe, first of all,
[21:35.680 --> 21:38.320]  that we now need nothing short of a world constitution
[21:38.320 --> 21:39.720]  for the global financial system.
[21:39.720 --> 21:42.560]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[21:42.560 --> 21:44.920]  So it's gonna be an inner, ruling elite,

[22:29.320 --> 22:30.640]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[22:30.640 --> 22:31.920]  Have you ever wondered why banks,
[22:31.920 --> 22:33.560]  stockbrokers, investment advisors
[22:33.560 --> 22:35.280]  won't talk about gold IRAs?
[22:35.280 --> 22:37.160]  They've been available since 1986,
[22:37.160 --> 22:39.200]  yet the financial industry won't recognize
[22:39.200 --> 22:41.040]  the value of gold for your retirement.
[22:41.040 --> 22:43.040]  Gold has outperformed paper investments,
[22:43.040 --> 22:44.680]  yet no word about IRAs.
[22:44.680 --> 22:46.840]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement,

[22:59.760 --> 23:03.040]  David J. Smith for NewsWatch Magazine.
[23:03.040 --> 23:04.440]  Did you know that it doesn't matter
[23:04.440 --> 23:07.880]  which political party occupies the White House?
[23:07.880 --> 23:09.280]  They have both been captured
[23:09.280 --> 23:11.360]  for those who are working for world government
[23:11.360 --> 23:14.120]  and the destruction of our Constitution.
[23:14.120 --> 23:15.800]  They believe that governments formed
[23:15.800 --> 23:17.760]  in the 18th and 19th centuries
[23:17.760 --> 23:20.400]  based upon constitutional rights of the people
[23:20.400 --> 23:24.160]  are now obsolete and need to be changed.
[23:24.160 --> 23:28.000]  That change will be to communism, socialism, fascism,
[23:28.000 --> 23:31.800]  a form of government that takes away all our rights.
[23:31.800 --> 23:33.360]  We'd like to help you understand
[23:33.360 --> 23:34.840]  why these things are happening

[24:08.880 --> 24:10.360]  Coming up later in the next hour,
[24:10.360 --> 24:12.000]  we've got some breaking news.
[24:12.000 --> 24:14.400]  I was just shown this during the break
[24:14.400 --> 24:16.800]  by Tim Fruget here in our office.
[24:16.800 --> 24:19.880]  Anderson Cooper versus Congressman Cohen debate
[24:19.880 --> 24:23.640]  is comparing Republicans to Nazis wrong.
[24:23.640 --> 24:26.040]  And I saw this already in the news today.
[24:26.040 --> 24:28.880]  It's made it into quite a few newspapers
[24:28.880 --> 24:33.600]  that he reportedly said this last night.
[24:33.600 --> 24:36.320]  And it's already in the news today, obviously.
[24:36.320 --> 24:37.440]  And guess who he goes after?
[24:37.440 --> 24:40.280]  Jesse Ventura, who now is out of the country.
[24:40.280 --> 24:43.400]  I know he would respond to this.
[24:43.400 --> 24:46.400]  And True TV and How Dare Us, the show
[24:46.400 --> 24:49.240]  that I really consulted on and had my seal on more
[24:49.240 --> 24:52.080]  than any of the other 16 programs that have aired.
[24:52.080 --> 24:54.360]  And I consulted on almost all of them.
[24:54.360 --> 25:00.600]  I mean, that was 80% my research, my stamp.
[25:00.600 --> 25:01.240]  And I'm proud of that.
[25:01.240 --> 25:03.480]  You've heard Ventura thank me here on air for the help.
[25:03.480 --> 25:06.360]  Our footage of the FEMA camp, the documents.
[25:06.360 --> 25:09.560]  We told them about what was already publicly available,
[25:09.560 --> 25:11.640]  the Model States Health Emergency Powers Act
[25:11.640 --> 25:14.600]  for roundups during pandemics, the secret documents
[25:14.600 --> 25:17.680]  from the state of New York dealing with mass graves
[25:17.680 --> 25:20.040]  during pandemics.
[25:20.040 --> 25:28.720]  The Model's Emergency Centers Act, the Emergency Centers
[25:28.720 --> 25:32.480]  Act, the 10 FEMA regions that there are now 10 governors
[25:32.480 --> 25:33.560]  over the US.
[25:33.560 --> 25:35.240]  I mean, that was a hardcore show.
[25:35.240 --> 25:38.120]  And they went and interviewed former FBI agents
[25:38.120 --> 25:39.800]  who were very prominent admitting that we're going
[25:39.800 --> 25:43.120]  into a form of martial law and that this is all wrong.
[25:43.120 --> 25:45.000]  And it was just a devastating program,
[25:45.000 --> 25:49.360]  devastating 46 minutes of broadcast hour long program
[25:49.360 --> 25:51.720]  total with the commercials in there.
[25:51.720 --> 25:56.320]  And he has just gone so far out here claiming that basically
[25:56.320 --> 25:59.200]  the Arizona shooting was connected to anybody
[25:59.200 --> 26:01.080]  criticizing the government.
[26:01.080 --> 26:04.200]  When it's well known now that Jared Lee Loeffner was
[26:04.200 --> 26:09.840]  a out of his mind hallucinogen addict who was a liberal
[26:09.840 --> 26:15.040]  and who was obsessed with the Congresswoman, who now they
[26:15.040 --> 26:17.160]  say is leaving the hospital this week
[26:17.160 --> 26:19.560]  and going to a Texas Rehabilitation Center.
[26:19.560 --> 26:21.760]  So we're certainly glad to hear that.
[26:21.760 --> 26:25.280]  But this whole story just gets stranger and stranger
[26:25.280 --> 26:25.880]  by the minute.
[26:25.880 --> 26:27.760]  So I'm going to cover that at 8 after starting
[26:27.760 --> 26:30.320]  the second segment of the next hour.
[26:30.320 --> 26:33.320]  We're going to be going over that because it is just
[26:33.320 --> 26:37.160]  absolutely incredible what this congressman is up to.
[26:37.160 --> 26:41.560]  Now, Homeland Security put pressure on Time Warner, which
[26:41.560 --> 26:42.960]  by the way, on CNN.
[26:42.960 --> 26:44.800]  I haven't seen the whole 14 minute clip yet.
[26:44.800 --> 26:48.680]  I only watched a few minutes, but didn't see them mention that.
[26:48.680 --> 26:51.560]  And this is a show promoted on Larry King Live and on other
[26:51.560 --> 26:54.400]  CNN shows in the last two years.
[26:54.400 --> 26:56.280]  And they thought, I guess, that people wouldn't take it
[26:56.280 --> 26:56.680]  serious.
[26:56.680 --> 26:58.120]  Well, they did take it serious.
[26:58.120 --> 27:01.600]  And I'm very proud to have been associated with the show.
[27:01.600 --> 27:04.640]  And Ventura had a private bet with my shelf and others
[27:04.640 --> 27:07.280]  that the first season would not air.
[27:07.280 --> 27:09.760]  But the head of True TV said, look, I've never been censored.
[27:09.760 --> 27:11.760]  They never tell me what I can and can't put on.
[27:11.760 --> 27:13.480]  They vetted and fact checked it all.
[27:13.480 --> 27:14.720]  And they put it on.
[27:14.720 --> 27:18.920]  And then they had all sorts of dirty tricks going on that they
[27:18.920 --> 27:21.960]  don't want me to get into behind the scenes.
[27:21.960 --> 27:24.840]  You heard Braverman, one of the producers and others here,
[27:24.840 --> 27:27.080]  say, look, you're lucky this is on the air.
[27:27.080 --> 27:29.160]  Before it even got pulled, he said there's a lot of stuff
[27:29.160 --> 27:31.560]  going on behind the scenes.
[27:31.560 --> 27:36.240]  And it probably won't be airing next year or new season.
[27:36.240 --> 27:38.720]  I haven't been told that, but that's what's in the wind.
[27:38.720 --> 27:42.120]  And they are pulling not just one episode, but others.
[27:42.120 --> 27:43.840]  Now, the evidence is showing.
[27:43.840 --> 27:45.800]  And they're doing something unprecedented.
[27:45.800 --> 27:47.680]  And I've got internal documents on this
[27:47.680 --> 27:49.560]  that obviously the sources have given us and asked
[27:49.560 --> 27:51.280]  that we not show, because it'll tell people
[27:51.280 --> 27:53.560]  exactly who it is, not with True TV.
[27:53.560 --> 27:57.960]  This is inside local cable companies getting the orders
[27:57.960 --> 28:02.680]  to erase all of the episodes off DVRs remotely.
[28:02.680 --> 28:07.600]  So this is just unprecedented censorship that's going on.
[28:07.600 --> 28:11.640]  And I don't like the fact that Congressman Cohen is running
[28:11.640 --> 28:13.400]  around doing this unchallenged.
[28:13.400 --> 28:18.400]  The word I got is the ADL was putting pressure on AOL.
[28:19.440 --> 28:24.040]  They, Cohen was Homeland Security and others.
[28:24.040 --> 28:26.160]  And Homeland Security is rolling out
[28:26.160 --> 28:27.080]  on the streets of America.
[28:27.080 --> 28:28.960]  In fact, I'll show this to you on screen
[28:28.960 --> 28:30.240]  when we come back from break.
[28:30.240 --> 28:35.240]  Homeland Security orders Americans around in the parking lot.
[28:35.680 --> 28:38.120]  And this is just a photo sent to us by a listener.
[28:38.120 --> 28:39.640]  I'd like to get an article written on this
[28:39.640 --> 28:41.640]  and tie it into the Viper teams
[28:41.640 --> 28:42.920]  and the Homeland Security teams.
[28:42.920 --> 28:45.440]  And the 9,000 locations getting telescreens,
[28:45.440 --> 28:47.440]  telling you to watch other shoppers in your neighbors
[28:47.440 --> 28:49.160]  with Homeland Security messages.
[28:49.160 --> 28:51.080]  But now it says, for your safety, please know,
[28:51.080 --> 28:54.240]  parking U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
[28:54.240 --> 28:57.520]  And this is yet a Stu Leonard's supermark
[28:57.520 --> 28:59.400]  in Yonkers, New York.
[28:59.400 --> 29:01.320]  That says, from a reader, I thought you liked to see
[29:01.320 --> 29:02.160]  the attached picture.
[29:02.160 --> 29:04.440]  It was taken by a friend of mine in the parking lot
[29:04.440 --> 29:08.120]  of a Stu Leonard's supermarket in Yonkers, New York.
[29:08.120 --> 29:12.200]  I guess the DHS can tell us where
[29:12.200 --> 29:15.360]  and where not to park.
[29:15.360 --> 29:18.480]  The sign was placed near the propane tanks.
[29:18.480 --> 29:20.360]  And again, the message is terrorists are everywhere.
[29:20.360 --> 29:22.280]  They may try to blow up propane tanks.
[29:22.280 --> 29:24.000]  So now you have this federal jurisdiction,
[29:24.000 --> 29:28.520]  this extrajudicial zoning where they go into parking lots
[29:28.520 --> 29:30.480]  at grocery stores in front of gas stations.
[29:30.480 --> 29:32.040]  They're just Homeland Security signs.
[29:32.040 --> 29:34.160]  Oh, sorry, can't use these parking spaces now.
[29:34.160 --> 29:35.840]  You know, you pull up to 7-Eleven,
[29:35.840 --> 29:38.280]  or you pull up to Home Depot, or you pull up
[29:38.280 --> 29:40.480]  and there's the propane tanks, Rhino, Propane,
[29:40.480 --> 29:41.560]  whatever the case may be.
[29:41.560 --> 29:43.280]  I bought a lot of it to barbecue.
[29:43.280 --> 29:45.720]  You know, it's all locked up in cages.
[29:45.720 --> 29:48.400]  Well, now, CEO, you can't be trusted to even park there.
[29:48.400 --> 29:51.280]  Al Qaeda may drive a truck up there and blow it up.
[29:51.280 --> 29:55.120]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[29:55.120 --> 29:58.080]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:58.080 --> 30:03.080]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting
[30:03.480 --> 30:06.760]  that in 2011, we will witness the most important day
[30:06.760 --> 30:09.080]  in America in more than 50 years.
[30:09.080 --> 30:11.640]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[30:11.640 --> 30:14.360]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children,
[30:14.360 --> 30:16.000]  and even how you take care of your health
[30:16.000 --> 30:17.000]  and your own family.
[30:17.000 --> 30:19.240]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions
[30:19.240 --> 30:20.080]  over the years.
[30:20.080 --> 30:22.360]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[30:22.360 --> 30:24.720]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM,
[30:24.720 --> 30:25.920]  Danny May, Freddie Mac,
[30:25.920 --> 30:28.560]  and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[30:28.560 --> 30:31.960]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[30:31.960 --> 30:33.560]  Recently, he created a video,
[30:33.560 --> 30:35.120]  which you can watch online for free,
[30:35.120 --> 30:37.760]  detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet,
[30:37.760 --> 30:39.320]  and it's a real eye-opener.
[30:39.320 --> 30:40.720]  I can't stress this enough.
[30:40.720 --> 30:43.400]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[30:43.400 --> 30:45.040]  He explains everything you need to know,
[30:45.040 --> 30:47.600]  including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[30:47.600 --> 30:52.240]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[30:52.240 --> 30:54.800]  That's End of America, the number three.com.
[30:54.800 --> 30:58.680]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[30:58.680 --> 31:01.000]  That's End of America3.com.
[31:01.000 --> 31:03.200]  Alex told you the government announced recently
[31:03.200 --> 31:04.580]  that the recession is over.
[31:04.580 --> 31:06.840]  It ended on June of 2009.
[31:06.840 --> 31:09.120]  The millions of Americans unable to find work
[31:09.120 --> 31:10.320]  might not agree.
[31:10.320 --> 31:12.520]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers
[31:12.520 --> 31:13.600]  and government employees,
[31:13.600 --> 31:16.280]  but for the rest of us, things seemed to be getting worse.
[31:16.280 --> 31:18.400]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[31:18.400 --> 31:21.400]  They've begun their long expected journey to the moon.
[31:21.400 --> 31:23.640]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars
[31:23.640 --> 31:24.760]  into gold and silver,
[31:24.760 --> 31:26.720]  you should consider a food savings account
[31:26.720 --> 31:27.960]  from eFoodsDirect.
[31:27.960 --> 31:30.120]  They both make fabulous investments.
[31:30.120 --> 31:31.880]  Food is our greatest dependency,
[31:31.880 --> 31:33.600]  and we know it will be more precious
[31:33.600 --> 31:35.480]  than any financial resource.
[31:35.480 --> 31:38.200]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis,
[31:38.200 --> 31:40.720]  and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[31:40.720 --> 31:43.200]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious,
[31:43.200 --> 31:46.160]  easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[31:46.160 --> 31:47.960]  This will freeze the cost of your food
[31:47.960 --> 31:49.320]  while you can still afford it.
[31:49.320 --> 31:51.880]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com on the internet,
[31:51.880 --> 31:55.120]  or call 800-409-5633.
[31:55.120 --> 31:59.880]  That's eFoodsDirect.com, or 800-409-5633.
[32:01.560 --> 32:03.920]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny
[32:03.920 --> 32:05.680]  in the last century alone.
[32:05.680 --> 32:08.880]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[32:08.880 --> 32:11.240]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[32:11.240 --> 32:14.160]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[32:14.160 --> 32:16.120]  We have turned a tremendous influence
[32:16.120 --> 32:18.200]  on our president and Congress,
[32:18.200 --> 32:20.040]  and they really are calling the shots.
[32:20.040 --> 32:22.920]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[32:22.920 --> 32:25.280]  as American citizens to pay attention.
[32:25.280 --> 32:28.560]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[32:28.560 --> 32:30.760]  The criminal offshore cartel
[32:30.760 --> 32:32.960]  held bent on destroying sovereignty,
[32:32.960 --> 32:35.360]  and on its ashes constructing world government.
[32:35.360 --> 32:37.760]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[32:37.760 --> 32:39.320]  They're asking for more matches,
[32:39.320 --> 32:40.560]  and the Congress is saying,
[32:40.560 --> 32:41.760]  who do we make the check out to?
[32:41.760 --> 32:43.920]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[32:43.920 --> 32:46.160]  And right now in Washington, D.C.,
[32:46.160 --> 32:49.040]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[32:49.040 --> 32:54.040]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[32:54.040 --> 32:55.760]  We're watching online right now
[32:55.760 --> 32:59.200]  in super-high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[32:59.200 --> 33:02.200]  Okay, again, we have these photos linked up
[33:02.200 --> 33:05.720]  on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com,
[33:05.720 --> 33:08.120]  and these are popping up all over the country
[33:08.120 --> 33:10.560]  as the federal government takes over
[33:10.560 --> 33:14.280]  every facet of our society ahead of the admission
[33:14.280 --> 33:16.600]  that we're going into an economic collapse.
[33:16.600 --> 33:17.600]  And if you want to find it,
[33:17.600 --> 33:19.960]  you just search the terms on the website,
[33:19.960 --> 33:22.080]  and you'll find the link to the link
[33:22.080 --> 33:23.400]  in the description below.
[33:23.400 --> 33:24.600]  And if you want to find it,
[33:24.600 --> 33:26.280]  you can find it on the website,
[33:26.280 --> 33:28.280]  and you can find it on the website,
[33:28.280 --> 33:31.280]  search the terms Homeland Security Orders Americans
[33:31.280 --> 33:33.120]  around in the parking lot.
[33:33.120 --> 33:36.880]  And this is again in Yonkers, New York at a grocery store.
[33:36.880 --> 33:39.400]  For your safety, please know parking,
[33:39.400 --> 33:42.680]  U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
[33:42.680 --> 33:45.520]  And then here's another photo that Matt Ryan found
[33:45.520 --> 33:49.280]  of a similar sign out front of store,
[33:49.280 --> 33:51.680]  just simply saying Homeland Security.
[33:51.680 --> 33:53.360]  All suspicious persons and activities
[33:53.360 --> 33:57.720]  are immediately reported to our law enforcement agency.
[33:57.720 --> 34:00.080]  But it's just this message that Homeland Security,
[34:00.080 --> 34:01.960]  Homeland Security, the other sign actually has
[34:01.960 --> 34:04.520]  the Homeland Security seal on it.
[34:04.520 --> 34:06.920]  And they're saying the TSA,
[34:06.920 --> 34:09.960]  they're gonna use the roads as their quote, jurisdiction.
[34:09.960 --> 34:10.920]  And then that was talked about
[34:10.920 --> 34:13.640]  in the North American Union SPP documents
[34:13.640 --> 34:15.800]  that we got in 2007.
[34:15.800 --> 34:16.920]  They tried to block the release,
[34:16.920 --> 34:18.520]  but judicial watch suit and got them.
[34:18.520 --> 34:20.800]  They said, we're gonna use the threat of terror
[34:20.800 --> 34:24.400]  as a way to merge Canada, the U.S. and Mexico,
[34:24.400 --> 34:27.240]  and to unify the security systems.
[34:27.240 --> 34:29.840]  And then we're gonna use the highways to tax people
[34:29.840 --> 34:33.680]  as part of this new North American Union to fund the SPP.
[34:33.680 --> 34:38.240]  So they're moving forward with all of this right now.
[34:38.240 --> 34:42.040]  And it's a classic authoritarian takeover model.
[34:42.040 --> 34:43.040]  But if you talk about it,
[34:43.040 --> 34:45.680]  are the threat fusion centers admittedly spying on people?
[34:45.680 --> 34:49.000]  Are the threat fusion centers illegally going to Ron Paul
[34:49.000 --> 34:51.960]  campaign for Liberty meetings that Ron Paul is at
[34:51.960 --> 34:53.640]  in Houston and other areas?
[34:53.640 --> 34:54.800]  I'm gonna bring this up to him Friday
[34:54.800 --> 34:56.600]  when he joins us in the first hour.
[34:56.600 --> 35:00.240]  And spying on Ron Paul and Ron Paul supporters,
[35:00.240 --> 35:02.480]  and Bob Barr supporters,
[35:02.480 --> 35:04.120]  the Mayak reported two years ago,
[35:06.160 --> 35:09.160]  is now just manifesting itself publicly.
[35:10.240 --> 35:11.880]  And they're training us to spy on each other,
[35:11.880 --> 35:13.600]  don't trust other citizens,
[35:13.600 --> 35:17.960]  just trust your great and all powerful government
[35:17.960 --> 35:20.720]  that cares so much about you.
[35:20.720 --> 35:23.440]  Now getting into other important stacks of news,
[35:23.440 --> 35:27.600]  coming up, house passes, the repeal of the government
[35:27.600 --> 35:30.040]  healthcare takeover, but problem is the Senate
[35:30.040 --> 35:32.800]  is set to block that.
[35:32.800 --> 35:35.200]  I wanna get into these mafia busts,
[35:35.200 --> 35:37.320]  reportedly going on in New York.
[35:37.320 --> 35:40.720]  I wanna get into some police state news,
[35:40.720 --> 35:44.000]  DC expanding public surveillance, Cameraman net,
[35:44.000 --> 35:47.040]  another report, Zimbabwe mulls, trees and charges
[35:47.040 --> 35:48.320]  over WikiLeaks.
[35:48.320 --> 35:49.600]  Now that's just some of what's coming up,
[35:49.600 --> 35:51.240]  but I wanna get back into China.
[35:51.240 --> 35:56.240]  We're being told in our media that America is falling apart.
[35:56.360 --> 36:01.360]  America is going in to a worse and worse economic atmosphere
[36:01.360 --> 36:04.160]  because we haven't accepted carbon taxes.
[36:04.160 --> 36:06.200]  That's like saying, if you've been shot in the chest
[36:06.200 --> 36:08.840]  with a shotgun or but are still barely alive,
[36:08.840 --> 36:12.600]  the reason that you're in critical condition
[36:12.600 --> 36:16.360]  is because you weren't shot another time with the shotgun
[36:16.360 --> 36:19.280]  or that several more shotgun blast at close range
[36:19.280 --> 36:20.960]  would probably help you.
[36:20.960 --> 36:24.320]  It's kind of like hammering nails and hitting your thumb
[36:24.320 --> 36:25.840]  and saying, well, the answer is just go ahead
[36:25.840 --> 36:28.360]  and hammer your hand full power.
[36:28.360 --> 36:31.120]  And it's never backed up by any facts or any research.
[36:31.120 --> 36:33.120]  Obviously carbon taxes will shut our economy down
[36:33.120 --> 36:34.400]  even faster.
[36:34.400 --> 36:36.120]  And then I've got all these articles today.
[36:36.120 --> 36:38.080]  I'm gonna dig through the stack and go over them
[36:38.080 --> 36:40.320]  where there's all these statements by Democrats
[36:40.320 --> 36:43.000]  and NASA people and others about, well,
[36:43.000 --> 36:45.400]  China's doing so good because they've put in
[36:45.400 --> 36:48.080]  all the environmental standards and the carbon taxes.
[36:48.080 --> 36:50.040]  They've put in none of it.
[36:50.040 --> 36:53.080]  They're the ones that refused the Copenhagen Treaty
[36:53.080 --> 36:56.040]  in late 2009 and now over a year ago.
[36:56.040 --> 36:57.040]  I mean, that's all on record.
[36:57.040 --> 37:02.040]  It's just, there's just so much ball face lying going on.
[37:03.440 --> 37:05.120]  But I wanted to go over some of these articles.
[37:05.120 --> 37:08.080]  Obama, we welcome China's rise.
[37:08.080 --> 37:10.000]  But this is not a rise of the Chinese people
[37:10.000 --> 37:11.880]  who are incredibly oppressed.
[37:11.880 --> 37:13.360]  China holds the record for oppression.
[37:13.360 --> 37:14.520]  No one denies that.
[37:15.760 --> 37:17.840]  This is about the corrupt elite of China
[37:17.840 --> 37:20.320]  teaming up with the robber barons of the West
[37:20.320 --> 37:23.520]  to basically leverage their market control
[37:23.520 --> 37:26.920]  to destroy all their political and economic competitors
[37:26.920 --> 37:28.720]  and vertically integrate society.
[37:29.840 --> 37:33.240]  I mean, here's a disgusting article out of Time Magazine.
[37:33.240 --> 37:37.840]  Why China does capitalism better than the US?
[37:37.840 --> 37:40.480]  I remember a decade ago, the Chinese dictator at the time,
[37:40.480 --> 37:41.600]  the president at the time,
[37:41.600 --> 37:46.200]  came out and said,
[37:47.200 --> 37:49.760]  China's communist system is the greatest expression
[37:49.760 --> 37:52.920]  of capitalism and the BBC was rammed with the headline.
[37:52.920 --> 37:54.680]  People were like, well, this makes no sense.
[37:54.680 --> 37:56.520]  Well, no, it's the type of capitalism
[37:56.520 --> 37:58.680]  the globalists are talking about.
[37:58.680 --> 38:01.560]  Where they destroy economies by design,
[38:01.560 --> 38:03.400]  they put regulations on their competition
[38:03.400 --> 38:04.560]  but not on themselves.
[38:04.560 --> 38:06.240]  It's all selectively enforced.
[38:06.240 --> 38:07.320]  It's not capitalism at all.
[38:07.320 --> 38:10.680]  It's just criminal mafia piracy.
[38:10.680 --> 38:13.080]  And that's what's happening in China.
[38:13.080 --> 38:14.560]  And they go through this gobbledygook
[38:14.560 --> 38:18.320]  about China responded properly to the economic crisis
[38:18.320 --> 38:21.160]  but the Western world didn't.
[38:21.160 --> 38:23.400]  Well, China's already a wholly owned subsidiary
[38:23.400 --> 38:24.320]  of the central banks.
[38:24.320 --> 38:26.240]  It's an authoritarian system.
[38:26.240 --> 38:27.560]  The globalists love it.
[38:27.560 --> 38:28.680]  I mean, they praise it.
[38:28.680 --> 38:31.280]  David Rockefeller, Ted Turner, Prince Charles,
[38:31.280 --> 38:33.080]  the list goes on and on.
[38:33.080 --> 38:36.480]  They are selling authoritarianism here
[38:36.480 --> 38:38.600]  as the solution to all our problems
[38:38.600 --> 38:41.600]  when it's these authoritarians that have already hamstrung
[38:41.600 --> 38:43.840]  us financially so that we're beholden
[38:43.840 --> 38:45.400]  under their control.
[38:45.400 --> 38:47.520]  I mean, it's so incredible.
[38:48.720 --> 38:51.800]  It's the tens and tens and tens and tens of trillions
[38:51.800 --> 38:53.520]  sucked out of Western coffers
[38:53.520 --> 38:55.720]  then pumped into the private central banks
[38:55.720 --> 38:59.840]  who run our treasury departments worldwide to the G20
[38:59.840 --> 39:02.880]  who said, we'll fix the economy if you give us more power.
[39:02.880 --> 39:05.120]  And then now things are accelerating in their decline.
[39:05.120 --> 39:07.520]  And their answer is, give us a hundred trillion more.
[39:07.520 --> 39:09.640]  I've got that in my economy stack today.
[39:12.320 --> 39:14.400]  Here's the Washington Times.
[39:17.000 --> 39:20.120]  China, U.S. number one, no more.
[39:20.120 --> 39:22.000]  And then they just go through statements
[39:22.000 --> 39:26.280]  by the Communist Party and links to just,
[39:26.280 --> 39:28.720]  it's gotta be more than 15 newspapers here
[39:28.720 --> 39:33.320]  where they're just talking about how we are a joke.
[39:33.320 --> 39:37.400]  And yeah, constantly I see the headlines out of China
[39:37.400 --> 39:40.200]  and the official government run papers.
[39:40.200 --> 39:41.440]  Well, I guess they're all government run.
[39:41.440 --> 39:44.320]  They reported last month that the only independent magazine
[39:44.320 --> 39:47.320]  in China was ordered shut down by the government.
[39:49.560 --> 39:53.720]  And then it's a dirty thing in our media
[39:53.720 --> 39:57.600]  when anybody asked the president about their,
[39:57.600 --> 40:01.280]  quote, human rights problem, like it's a problem.
[40:01.280 --> 40:02.720]  This is their policy.
[40:02.720 --> 40:04.440]  This is what they intend to do.
[40:04.440 --> 40:07.640]  So it goes over all of that.
[40:07.640 --> 40:11.320]  And you've got these disgusting mainline liberals.
[40:11.320 --> 40:13.120]  This is out of a French news agency.
[40:13.120 --> 40:15.720]  Jackie Chan, Barbara Streisand,
[40:15.720 --> 40:18.420]  lead Hu Jintao state dinner guest.
[40:19.560 --> 40:21.400]  And it goes into how they praised him
[40:21.400 --> 40:24.080]  and how was a star studded lineup of liberals.
[40:25.120 --> 40:26.560]  Well, look at this article.
[40:27.360 --> 40:32.360]  I've got one here in the stack dealing with what's happening
[40:32.360 --> 40:35.280]  with Apple.
[40:36.760 --> 40:40.920]  Apple and its factories in China are,
[40:40.920 --> 40:43.680]  in every case I've seen, are the facilities,
[40:43.680 --> 40:46.120]  these giant factory cities,
[40:46.120 --> 40:51.120]  they're private complexes run by the government,
[40:51.560 --> 40:53.800]  with government backing, with government police in them,
[40:53.800 --> 40:56.400]  where they're having massive suicides every day.
[40:56.400 --> 40:58.200]  They had to put nets around them
[40:58.200 --> 40:59.720]  because the people would climb up on the roof
[40:59.720 --> 41:02.480]  and jump off headfirst trying to kill themselves.
[41:04.520 --> 41:07.320]  And I've got the articles here,
[41:07.320 --> 41:09.440]  one of the stack I'm gonna get to,
[41:09.440 --> 41:11.560]  where China, again, is being praised
[41:11.560 --> 41:14.320]  for accepting carbon taxes and environmental standards
[41:14.320 --> 41:17.800]  that we won't, that is a ridiculous hoax.
[41:17.800 --> 41:19.840]  That's like saying Godzilla is real
[41:19.840 --> 41:21.300]  and attacked Tokyo last week.
[41:21.300 --> 41:25.840]  I mean, it is a verifiable, absolute, ball-faced lie.
[41:25.840 --> 41:28.920]  But then you see the truth occasionally rear its ugly head,
[41:28.920 --> 41:31.440]  but by individual Chinese citizens,
[41:31.440 --> 41:33.640]  who I'm sure will get arrested or imprisoned
[41:33.640 --> 41:35.160]  or sent to a reeducation camp,
[41:35.160 --> 41:38.200]  because you criticize things there, that's what happens.
[41:38.200 --> 41:41.400]  Again, Paul Watson's wife contributed to one article,
[41:41.400 --> 41:45.600]  she's Chinese, to one article and her family
[41:45.600 --> 41:46.800]  and people got threatened,
[41:46.800 --> 41:49.080]  and she was told all the way into England,
[41:49.080 --> 41:51.800]  you better not write for prison planning anymore.
[41:51.800 --> 41:53.760]  And we're only one step away from that
[41:53.760 --> 41:56.360]  with Congressman Cohen running around on a witch hunt
[41:56.360 --> 41:58.880]  against Jesse Ventura, myself and others.
[41:58.880 --> 42:01.000]  He's getting shows pulled off television.
[42:04.160 --> 42:07.040]  And reportedly they pulled the shows,
[42:07.040 --> 42:08.800]  so that Homeland Security and Cohen
[42:08.800 --> 42:10.600]  wouldn't start demonizing them and attacking them,
[42:10.600 --> 42:14.160]  but of course they went ahead and went after them anyways.
[42:14.160 --> 42:15.800]  I mean, that's where we're going here.
[42:15.800 --> 42:19.560]  Apple faces pollution storm in China.
[42:19.560 --> 42:21.320]  I thought Apple's liberal.
[42:21.320 --> 42:22.860]  I mean, they got Al Gore on their board.
[42:22.860 --> 42:24.760]  They're always telling us how we gotta shut down
[42:24.760 --> 42:27.920]  Texas power plants, how we gotta pass carbon taxes
[42:27.920 --> 42:30.720]  that are paid to Al Gore and the IMF and World Bank.
[42:32.320 --> 42:34.400]  You look at the big carbon trading company in England,
[42:34.400 --> 42:36.200]  the biggest in the world, Rothschild owned.
[42:36.200 --> 42:38.040]  I looked up Sir James Wolfson last night
[42:38.040 --> 42:39.660]  doing some research on him, I already knew it,
[42:39.660 --> 42:42.200]  but how he's named after James Rothschild
[42:42.200 --> 42:44.600]  and how he was born on Rothschild's birthday
[42:44.600 --> 42:46.900]  and all this weirdness, now he works with a Rothschild.
[42:46.900 --> 42:50.840]  That's who ran the World Bank for all those years.
[42:51.840 --> 42:54.280]  I mean, it's disgusting to watch this mafia
[42:54.280 --> 42:55.840]  getting away with this.
[42:55.840 --> 42:57.960]  But then on a high horse telling us
[42:57.960 --> 43:01.880]  we can't collect rainwater and then I've gotta pay
[43:01.880 --> 43:04.280]  a three plus billion dollar carbon tax
[43:04.280 --> 43:05.920]  living here in Austin over the next three years
[43:05.920 --> 43:06.760]  to these people.
[43:06.760 --> 43:08.520]  Oh yeah, they couldn't get Congress to pass it,
[43:08.520 --> 43:10.040]  so they're just coming in buying off the cities
[43:10.040 --> 43:10.880]  and doing it.
[43:10.880 --> 43:14.520]  Continuing, Apple faces pollution storm in China.
[43:14.520 --> 43:16.920]  A group of 36 Chinese environmental groups
[43:16.920 --> 43:19.200]  has accused Apple of failing to address concerns
[43:19.200 --> 43:22.160]  over pollution and worker health issues in factories
[43:22.160 --> 43:23.720]  supplying components for its gadgets.
[43:23.720 --> 43:26.200]  Yeah, the fumes, the toxic waste.
[43:26.200 --> 43:28.680]  I mean, you look at photos of these people
[43:28.680 --> 43:30.880]  in their work in 16, 18 hours a day,
[43:30.880 --> 43:32.440]  their children are taken from them
[43:32.440 --> 43:33.760]  and raised in government facilities.
[43:33.760 --> 43:34.760]  This is all on record.
[43:34.760 --> 43:37.240]  This is what Apple supports.
[43:37.240 --> 43:39.200]  And then you see every liberal car in Austin,
[43:39.200 --> 43:40.640]  almost every with Apple stickers,
[43:40.640 --> 43:41.800]  and there's just one around.
[43:41.800 --> 43:43.240]  Apple's so liberal.
[43:43.240 --> 43:45.080]  Oh my gosh, it's so good.
[43:46.240 --> 43:48.200]  And we've got Apple editing computers
[43:48.200 --> 43:49.880]  because they're inexpensive and work well
[43:49.880 --> 43:52.320]  compared to even more expensive systems we've tried.
[43:52.320 --> 43:53.840]  You know, G5s and all that stuff
[43:53.840 --> 43:55.680]  and whatever their names are.
[43:55.680 --> 44:00.040]  But you know, the issue is we're just pointing out
[44:00.040 --> 44:01.920]  that this is a monstrous wicked company
[44:01.920 --> 44:04.960]  just like Microsoft and they always pose as liberals.
[44:04.960 --> 44:06.440]  Bill Gates says he's putting, you know,
[44:06.440 --> 44:08.080]  hundreds of billions of dollars of his
[44:08.080 --> 44:10.960]  and other people's money in this tax-free foundation
[44:10.960 --> 44:12.160]  to save the earth.
[44:12.160 --> 44:15.320]  Those are businesses they run tax-free.
[44:15.320 --> 44:17.240]  Just like Obama's buddies are all exempt
[44:17.240 --> 44:18.360]  from the healthcare law.
[44:18.360 --> 44:19.600]  They don't have to buy the insurance.
[44:19.600 --> 44:22.600]  It's all fraud.
[44:31.600 --> 44:35.160]  And Jaren just walked in and gave me something
[44:35.160 --> 44:37.880]  to completely, just completely blew me away.
[44:37.880 --> 44:42.880]  They have been quietly beta testing.
[44:45.000 --> 44:47.000]  I can hardly talk what I was just showing.
[44:47.000 --> 44:51.240]  It's just one more piece of the tens of thousands
[44:51.240 --> 44:53.440]  of pieces that totally confirms
[44:53.440 --> 44:56.200]  we're absolutely on target about everything we've said
[44:56.200 --> 44:57.920]  except for the fact that it's worse
[44:57.920 --> 44:59.240]  than I could even imagine.
[44:59.240 --> 45:03.360]  Every night now, every morning, I am freaked out
[45:03.360 --> 45:05.200]  when I'm eating breakfast with my children
[45:05.200 --> 45:07.200]  or drinking a cup of coffee or researching
[45:07.200 --> 45:08.640]  that this is so real.
[45:08.640 --> 45:12.600]  Every day I wake up at 6 a.m. or even earlier.
[45:12.600 --> 45:14.400]  Today I slept in late.
[45:14.400 --> 45:15.920]  I woke up at about 7 30
[45:15.920 --> 45:17.840]  and I woke up in the bed
[45:17.840 --> 45:19.600]  with my children running into the room.
[45:19.600 --> 45:21.560]  I looked at how innocent and good they are
[45:21.560 --> 45:24.600]  and how they deserve a future of liberty and freedom.
[45:24.600 --> 45:27.960]  And I just said, God, I hope this country repents.
[45:27.960 --> 45:30.640]  When our government is openly embracing China,
[45:30.640 --> 45:33.200]  the most murderous government in history
[45:33.200 --> 45:35.040]  and trying to spin it like it's good
[45:35.040 --> 45:36.520]  and our media all over the place
[45:36.520 --> 45:38.040]  is telling us how China is great
[45:38.040 --> 45:41.000]  and how authoritarianism is kind of cool
[45:41.000 --> 45:42.240]  and gets things done.
[45:42.240 --> 45:47.240]  China allows parents who aren't,
[45:48.400 --> 45:50.080]  they take the rural families' children
[45:50.080 --> 45:52.720]  and put them in these factories as young as 10.
[45:52.720 --> 45:54.560]  But in other cases, they just take people's children
[45:54.560 --> 45:56.160]  and chain them to light poles
[45:56.160 --> 45:58.520]  and the police allow it when they go to work.
[45:58.520 --> 46:01.760]  And the kid sits there for 14, 15, 16 hours,
[46:01.760 --> 46:03.600]  chained to a pole.
[46:03.600 --> 46:05.280]  No food, no nothing.
[46:05.280 --> 46:07.400]  And the father, I saw on one piece was interviewed,
[46:07.400 --> 46:09.560]  he said, well, I've got to go work.
[46:09.560 --> 46:11.880]  He pulls people in a hand-drawn taxi
[46:11.880 --> 46:12.760]  or there'll be no food.
[46:12.760 --> 46:14.760]  And he gets that money every night and runs
[46:14.760 --> 46:16.360]  and gets his son and goes back to his wife
[46:16.360 --> 46:18.720]  and they eat the food that the money bought
[46:18.720 --> 46:22.080]  and they live in a shack by a toxic waste river.
[46:22.080 --> 46:23.320]  That was just one case.
[46:23.320 --> 46:25.760]  And that's what we're competing against.
[46:27.160 --> 46:28.640]  That's the lifting China up.
[46:28.640 --> 46:30.240]  It's actually brought China down.
[46:34.800 --> 46:38.040]  And then they praise China for its environmental standards.
[46:38.040 --> 46:40.960]  But when our government openly embraces tyranny,
[46:40.960 --> 46:43.440]  now worldwide, the push for homeland security,
[46:43.440 --> 46:44.520]  the push for checkpoints,
[46:44.520 --> 46:47.800]  the push for wireless wiretapping, warrantless wiretapping,
[46:50.200 --> 46:51.960]  that is now used instead of America
[46:51.960 --> 46:53.120]  being that example of liberty,
[46:53.120 --> 46:55.480]  it's now the example of tyranny being good.
[46:55.480 --> 46:56.720]  And so is China.
[46:58.560 --> 47:02.520]  And I remember back to the Sandpoint Nable Brig
[47:03.560 --> 47:05.960]  and I remember it was confirmed by local police
[47:05.960 --> 47:07.960]  and all three newspapers in Seattle.
[47:07.960 --> 47:10.960]  I'm about to get to the new news, it all ties together.
[47:12.640 --> 47:14.240]  I'm trying to bring you into my understanding,
[47:14.240 --> 47:17.560]  my worldview, so you can see the three-dimensional model
[47:17.560 --> 47:18.800]  and then integrate it yourself
[47:18.800 --> 47:21.400]  and then tie it into your own data you're picking up locally
[47:21.400 --> 47:24.480]  so you understand how I think, how I understand all this.
[47:24.480 --> 47:26.120]  The minute Jared brought this in
[47:26.120 --> 47:27.640]  and I just looked down at it,
[47:27.640 --> 47:29.760]  I'm not telling you what it is yet,
[47:29.760 --> 47:33.920]  it instantly caused an entire matrix grid of understanding
[47:33.920 --> 47:37.160]  with thousands of research data points historically
[47:37.160 --> 47:38.840]  and what's happening domestically.
[47:38.840 --> 47:40.680]  Army checkpoints we videotape,
[47:40.680 --> 47:43.800]  pulling over buses and searching citizens 12 years ago,
[47:43.800 --> 47:48.400]  13 years ago in Central Texas, fake nuclear spills on I-35
[47:48.400 --> 47:50.000]  we've witnessed and exposed
[47:50.000 --> 47:52.640]  to practice martial law takeover drills
[47:52.640 --> 47:55.320]  where they announced the nuclear spill is real.
[47:55.320 --> 47:58.800]  Homeland security rolling out at shopping malls and Walmart's
[47:58.800 --> 48:03.640]  and citizen spy grids and professionals from Dennis
[48:03.640 --> 48:08.040]  to managers to you name it, I mean my own father
[48:08.040 --> 48:12.240]  and then he went in and told the other dentist about it
[48:12.240 --> 48:14.160]  and he said, oh yeah, they came to my house last week
[48:14.160 --> 48:16.880]  separately and tried to recruit me for Homeland Security
[48:16.880 --> 48:20.600]  to spy on people, to spy on patients.
[48:20.600 --> 48:22.840]  I mean, it's just secret police are everywhere.
[48:22.840 --> 48:27.840]  They've built this giant army, this giant grid up
[48:29.360 --> 48:32.560]  and it's all around us ahead of the total collapse
[48:32.560 --> 48:35.200]  of our economy and then they'll offer the solution
[48:35.200 --> 48:38.200]  of an authoritarian system in the United States
[48:38.200 --> 48:42.120]  as the answer and a complete top down engineered
[48:42.120 --> 48:45.280]  managed economy, a command and control economy.
[48:46.160 --> 48:51.080]  But going back to Seattle, in Seattle
[48:51.080 --> 48:53.520]  and I have this in police state to the takeover,
[48:55.000 --> 48:56.440]  clips from local news,
[48:56.440 --> 49:00.040]  the Pentagon sent in Delta Force.
[49:00.040 --> 49:03.440]  They met up with Ford Foundation hired anarchist
[49:03.440 --> 49:04.440]  who knew they were hired.
[49:04.440 --> 49:06.080]  They were housed in a government building.
[49:06.080 --> 49:07.960]  They were protected by the police.
[49:07.960 --> 49:10.440]  They went out and attacked the police,
[49:10.440 --> 49:12.360]  other police that weren't aware of the operation.
[49:12.360 --> 49:13.840]  Those police were told to stand out.
[49:13.840 --> 49:14.840]  It's all on video.
[49:16.080 --> 49:18.280]  And then they let the media film that
[49:18.280 --> 49:20.360]  and the public for a day and a half say,
[49:20.360 --> 49:22.720]  why aren't the police doing anything about them burning?
[49:22.720 --> 49:25.200]  And then they let the media film that
[49:25.200 --> 49:27.600]  at least doing anything about them burning trash cans,
[49:27.600 --> 49:30.960]  knocking out windows, attacking McDonald's and Starbucks,
[49:30.960 --> 49:32.000]  do something.
[49:32.000 --> 49:34.800]  And they said, okay, problem reaction solution.
[49:34.800 --> 49:38.760]  Then they unleashed the military, the state police,
[49:38.760 --> 49:40.360]  the police from all over the state,
[49:40.360 --> 49:43.800]  the Seattle police on the 60,000 peaceful demonstrators
[49:43.800 --> 49:45.920]  and routed them even into neighborhoods,
[49:45.920 --> 49:48.800]  running up and savagely beating even old women,
[49:48.800 --> 49:51.760]  young women, men pulling cars over randomly,
[49:51.760 --> 49:55.320]  dragging women out, spraying pepper spray on them.
[49:55.320 --> 49:59.560]  It was a police riot that the social engineers had triggered
[50:00.440 --> 50:02.520]  and it later all came out in the news
[50:02.520 --> 50:05.080]  and I have it in police state too, the takeover.
[50:08.040 --> 50:09.800]  Give me some background here.
[50:09.800 --> 50:14.800]  Then I send my crew to the G20 over a year ago now.
[50:16.200 --> 50:18.480]  It's in police state for the rise of FEMA.
[50:18.480 --> 50:21.200]  I sent him to Pittsburgh and more than half the city
[50:21.200 --> 50:23.480]  is off limits to even be out and shop.
[50:23.480 --> 50:25.920]  We have footage of old ladies coming out of a grocery store
[50:25.920 --> 50:27.880]  with bags and a police dog attacks them
[50:27.880 --> 50:29.200]  and the women say, we're shopping.
[50:29.200 --> 50:31.280]  And they say, no one allowed.
[50:31.280 --> 50:34.280]  Footage of armored vehicles driving through neighborhoods,
[50:34.280 --> 50:36.960]  kids playing with footballs and broadcasting,
[50:36.960 --> 50:40.280]  go in your houses now or we're gonna hit you with sound cannons.
[50:40.280 --> 50:41.880]  Hired provocateurs again.
[50:44.000 --> 50:46.240]  They admit under the emergency centers act
[50:46.240 --> 50:48.400]  they're gonna use military bases to hold people
[50:48.400 --> 50:51.960]  and when they arrested Rob, dude, Luke Radowski and others,
[50:51.960 --> 50:54.160]  they took them to a military base.
[50:54.160 --> 50:56.760]  Guess where they're taking the 100 Mafia people
[50:58.120 --> 50:59.440]  to a military base.
[51:01.240 --> 51:02.560]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[51:02.560 --> 51:04.040]  Did you know that the global elite
[51:04.040 --> 51:05.880]  are now storing non-hybrid seeds
[51:05.880 --> 51:08.160]  and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[51:08.160 --> 51:09.920]  Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[51:09.920 --> 51:13.120]  non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[51:13.120 --> 51:14.960]  It's true, seeds have all performed even gold
[51:14.960 --> 51:16.440]  and silver before in this country
[51:16.440 --> 51:18.680]  and it's possible that could even happen again.
[51:18.680 --> 51:20.880]  So our friends at Solutions from Science
[51:20.880 --> 51:23.960]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[51:23.960 --> 51:26.240]  They call it a survival seed bank
[51:26.240 --> 51:28.440]  and it can produce an endless supply
[51:28.440 --> 51:31.040]  of nutrient dense food for you and your family.
[51:31.040 --> 51:32.160]  And here's the best part,
[51:32.160 --> 51:35.280]  these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way
[51:35.280 --> 51:36.520]  and you actually get enough seeds
[51:36.520 --> 51:38.800]  to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[51:38.800 --> 51:42.040]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[51:42.040 --> 51:44.280]  That's survivalseedbank.com
[51:44.280 --> 51:48.840]  or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[51:48.840 --> 51:53.000]  That's 877-327-0365.
[51:53.000 --> 51:55.280]  Remember, in a real crisis,
[51:55.280 --> 51:57.880]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[51:57.880 --> 52:00.880]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[52:00.880 --> 52:03.280]  They help to create a new world order.
[52:03.280 --> 52:05.560]  We are part of a new world order.
[52:05.560 --> 52:08.720]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[52:08.720 --> 52:11.920]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists
[52:11.920 --> 52:13.920]  through their own words and documents.
[52:13.920 --> 52:15.920]  The new world order really is a tool
[52:15.920 --> 52:18.360]  for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[52:18.360 --> 52:20.880]  It means all the world under their control.
[52:20.880 --> 52:23.640]  The United Nations would take over America.
[52:23.640 --> 52:26.520]  The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world.
[52:26.520 --> 52:30.040]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence
[52:30.040 --> 52:31.960]  have worked in stealth for centuries
[52:31.960 --> 52:34.480]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[52:34.480 --> 52:37.200]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short
[52:37.200 --> 52:39.880]  of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[52:39.880 --> 52:42.720]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[52:42.720 --> 52:45.120]  So it's gonna be an inner ruling elite
[52:45.120 --> 52:46.440]  and then everyone else.
[52:46.440 --> 52:47.560]  And I got news for you.
[52:47.560 --> 52:48.840]  You're everyone else.

[53:00.480 --> 53:02.880]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems
[53:02.880 --> 53:05.120]  are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[53:18.840 --> 53:21.000]  that purify water by removing chlorine,
[53:21.000 --> 53:23.360]  pathogenic bacteria, cyst and parasites
[53:23.360 --> 53:26.200]  to non detectable levels and remove harmful chemicals

[53:56.480 --> 53:58.880]  That's goberkey.com today.
[53:58.880 --> 54:22.800]  What's happening is, they got rid of the Glass-Steagall Act.
[54:22.800 --> 54:25.200]  They were going to implode the United States,
[54:25.200 --> 54:30.400]  Ireland, the rest of Europe in a coordinated global operation
[54:30.400 --> 54:33.520]  but they had to put the police state grid in place.
[54:33.520 --> 54:36.320]  And that's why the Rand Corporation and others in 99
[54:36.320 --> 54:38.520]  said we're moving into a police state.
[54:38.520 --> 54:40.320]  This is how we're going to federalize police.
[54:40.320 --> 54:41.320]  They published it all.
[54:41.320 --> 54:45.480]  We've shown you the command set up under federal control
[54:45.480 --> 54:49.560]  for small towns, medium towns, cities, large cities,
[54:49.560 --> 54:53.000]  metropolis, it's all there.
[54:53.000 --> 54:57.320]  We have their complete program.
[54:57.320 --> 55:01.440]  And it literally staggers me to see this happening.
[55:01.440 --> 55:04.160]  And to now have this background of Congressman Cohen
[55:04.160 --> 55:07.680]  and countless others calling for restrictions on free speech,
[55:07.680 --> 55:11.120]  saying we need a driver's license to get on the internet,
[55:11.120 --> 55:13.120]  internet ID.
[55:13.120 --> 55:15.320]  We need a speed limit on speech.
[55:15.320 --> 55:18.080]  There needs to be prior constraint on speech.
[55:18.080 --> 55:20.280]  The government wants to be able under cybersecurity
[55:20.280 --> 55:22.840]  to put announcements on everyone's websites.
[55:22.840 --> 55:26.280]  It's an overlay through your ISP, like a forced pop-up
[55:26.280 --> 55:28.560]  to counter information you're putting out.
[55:28.560 --> 55:30.960]  Cass Sunstein's talked about arresting people.
[55:30.960 --> 55:32.560]  He's the White House regulations are
[55:32.560 --> 55:36.120]  that deny global warming or talk about 9-11 being an inside job.
[55:36.120 --> 55:40.120]  I mean, this is real authoritarianism and a high-tech version.
[55:40.120 --> 55:42.120]  And we've got multiple articles on this,
[55:42.120 --> 55:44.360]  Biggest Mafia Buzz to New York City History,
[55:44.360 --> 55:47.560]  Videos of Arrest, the examiner has this.
[55:47.560 --> 55:52.040]  And at the end, there's a little blurb quoting NBC
[55:52.040 --> 55:54.480]  and the New York Daily News.
[55:54.480 --> 55:57.240]  So this is New York Daily News is the original source of this.
[55:57.240 --> 56:00.000]  The defendants are being held in the brig
[56:00.000 --> 56:03.760]  at Fort Hamilton, an army post in Brooklyn.
[56:03.760 --> 56:07.440]  So they held them at the quote FEMA Center,
[56:07.440 --> 56:10.240]  that's on the news in 99 in Seattle.
[56:10.240 --> 56:14.360]  They held Luke Radowski, Rob Do and others,
[56:14.360 --> 56:16.960]  and they would bring people in on trucks with the army,
[56:16.960 --> 56:20.080]  with the police, and they had some people with bags
[56:20.080 --> 56:22.080]  over their heads like they were al-Qaeda.
[56:24.120 --> 56:26.280]  And they're just acclimating everyone
[56:26.280 --> 56:29.360]  and that's what the Emergency Centers Act says
[56:29.360 --> 56:32.720]  is we'll use military bases for any type of emergency,
[56:32.720 --> 56:33.920]  including civil unrest.
[56:33.920 --> 56:37.360]  They're gearing up to literally go door-to-door
[56:37.360 --> 56:40.240]  with army trucks and take you out and put you in it
[56:40.240 --> 56:41.720]  and you disappear.
[56:41.720 --> 56:46.040]  And this is so brazen, so illegal, so tyrannical, so wicked,
[56:46.040 --> 56:48.960]  we openly have foreign banks looting us.
[56:48.960 --> 56:51.320]  Fort Plus Trillion now missing from the Pentagon,
[56:51.320 --> 56:55.920]  open crime, and they're coming in
[56:55.920 --> 56:58.480]  and they're putting up homeland security signs everywhere
[56:58.480 --> 57:00.240]  and they're recruiting citizens everywhere
[57:00.240 --> 57:03.080]  and they are creating block captains everywhere
[57:03.080 --> 57:04.000]  to spy on their neighbors.
[57:04.000 --> 57:06.640]  I mean, they're really going to do this.
[57:07.480 --> 57:09.280]  They've committed such huge crimes,
[57:09.280 --> 57:10.600]  that's what tyranny is.
[57:10.600 --> 57:12.840]  The average person over the years on the street
[57:12.840 --> 57:13.960]  or whatever says, why do I care?
[57:13.960 --> 57:15.040]  I've nothing to hide.
[57:15.040 --> 57:17.160]  You know, I'm just a professor, I'm just a school teacher,
[57:17.160 --> 57:20.120]  I'm just a lawyer, I just go watch football
[57:20.120 --> 57:22.160]  and come home at six o'clock every night.
[57:22.160 --> 57:24.720]  Alex, you can fight tyranny all you want, why should I care?
[57:24.720 --> 57:27.800]  Because the tyranny's for you, Bozo.
[57:27.800 --> 57:28.760]  You understand that?
[57:28.760 --> 57:31.160]  The tyranny is for all these police officers,
[57:31.160 --> 57:32.840]  all these military people,
[57:32.840 --> 57:35.400]  they're all destroying their own country,
[57:35.400 --> 57:36.720]  but they're doing it through ignorance
[57:36.720 --> 57:39.320]  because it's slowly, incrementally done.
[57:39.320 --> 57:43.120]  And then we dare put out an hour-long TV show
[57:43.120 --> 57:44.840]  detailing the threat fusion centers,
[57:44.840 --> 57:47.640]  the 10 FEMA Governors, the Marshall Law Plan,
[57:48.840 --> 57:50.120]  the Emergency Centers Act,
[57:50.120 --> 57:51.840]  and they go ape and have it pulled.
[57:51.840 --> 57:55.400]  Another indicator of how deep we are into this.
[57:55.400 --> 57:56.920]  New York Daily News reporting,
[57:56.920 --> 57:59.320]  the defendants are being held in the brig
[57:59.320 --> 58:02.120]  at Fort Hamilton, an army post in Brooklyn.
[58:02.120 --> 58:06.240]  1937 headline, the local Jews from the town
[58:06.240 --> 58:08.360]  are being held at the local army depot.
[58:08.360 --> 58:13.360]  When your army that you supposedly defend your country
[58:15.040 --> 58:18.280]  starts being used and trained to engage citizens,
[58:18.280 --> 58:21.280]  that's called tyranny, that's called banana republic.
[58:23.960 --> 58:26.680]  Oh man, I tell you what, New York Daily News.
[58:28.600 --> 58:30.920]  I mean, do you see what's happening in our media
[58:30.920 --> 58:33.520]  and putting Chinese flags up in DC?
[58:33.520 --> 58:37.600]  This is a soft power coup over America of the offshore banks
[58:37.600 --> 58:39.560]  and their muscle is our military, our police,
[58:39.560 --> 58:41.240]  and the communist Chinese.
[58:41.240 --> 58:46.240]  On air, online, and on demand,

[01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:36.200]  and his strange statements out of Hawaii.
[01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:38.320]  Dealing with Obama's birth certificate.
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:39.680]  We're gonna have open phones coming up
[01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:44.680]  and a lot of important news in the third hour today.
[01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:46.480]  Coming up in the next segment,
[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:50.520]  Anderson Cooper versus Congress and Cohen debate
[01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:54.400]  is comparing Republicans to Nazis out of line.
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:58.280]  And they're basically trying to imply
[01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:01.080]  that the shooting in Arizona is still caused
[01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:02.920]  by Republicans and by free speech.
[01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:05.720]  And they go on to attack true TV and the show
[01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:07.600]  that one of the big shows I appeared in,
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:09.360]  the police aid episode that I consulted on.
[01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:11.280]  The course are footage of the FEMA Center
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:12.400]  with the kids in it.
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:14.960]  The Model States Emergency Powers Act,
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:16.600]  the Emergency Centers Act.
[01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:18.240]  We're gonna comment on that.
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:21.640]  There's so many levels to this coming up,
[01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:23.720]  but we have an examiner report here.
[01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:30.800]  The defendants are being held at the Brig in Fort Hamilton,
[01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:32.280]  an army post in Brooklyn.
[01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:33.440]  And we're continuing to look into that,
[01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:36.960]  but we see this happening over and over
[01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:39.320]  and over and over and over again.
[01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:43.720]  Where they're got the,
[01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:45.800]  a lot of times the threat fusion centers now
[01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:48.120]  aren't just federalized with CIA involved,
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:49.680]  tied into all the surveillance cameras
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:50.840]  and the face scanning cameras
[01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:52.560]  and the license plate reading cameras,
[01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:55.000]  but now they will move them in
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.120]  with the old National Guard base that was quote,
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:59.400]  shut down and then, oh, now we're gonna augment you
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:01.120]  with regular army.
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:03.280]  And they have the National Guard helping
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:05.160]  in drug interdiction all over the country
[01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:07.200]  with their helicopters and now ground police.
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:10.080]  And then we have in New York,
[01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:12.960]  upstate the news articles about the National Guard
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:15.640]  helped arrest 2,000 people for gun and drug charges
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:18.480]  at checkpoints where they have x-ray scanners
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:19.880]  scanning people's cars.
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:21.240]  They're just rolling it out
[01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:25.560]  and the Marines running checkpoints in central California,
[01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:28.640]  looking for drunk drivers, off base,
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:30.720]  citizens pulling US citizens over.
[01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:32.640]  They're just training local police
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:34.320]  and local governments everywhere
[01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:36.400]  with army drills, Marine Corps drills.
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:37.920]  They're training the military, the police,
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:41.160]  the citizens, the media, all of us to acclimate us
[01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:46.160]  and condition us and prepare our minds to accept this.
[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:52.600]  And to see our country sliding into this,
[01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:55.560]  it just really makes me sad.
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:57.520]  I grieve for our nation.
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:00.000]  I mourn for our nation.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.240]  You think the banks are gonna stop
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:03.160]  at stealing 28 trillion in the last two years
[01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:04.920]  and not telling Congress where the money went?
[01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:06.880]  You think they're gonna stop with killing a million Iraqis?
[01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:09.600]  You think they're gonna stop with drone attacks every day
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:11.680]  at weddings killing whole groups of people
[01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:13.200]  in Afghanistan and Pakistan?
[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:14.400]  You think they're gonna stop?
[01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:15.760]  You think the globalists care about you
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:17.720]  any more than they care about an Iraqi?
[01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:20.440]  We have to repent, especially mainline conservatives.
[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:22.600]  I never supported any of the wars or anything.
[01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:24.520]  But the point is, those of you out there
[01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:25.920]  who I know aren't bad people,
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:27.920]  who got sucked into this war fever,
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:29.480]  you gotta repent for that.
[01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:32.280]  Democrats have gotta repent for the 51 million abortions.
[01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:37.360]  And even if you don't believe in God,
[01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:39.800]  we've gotta recognize that we're not valuing human life
[01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:42.400]  and that if we don't value other people's life,
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:45.160]  then how do we expect to have any due process?
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:47.840]  How do we expect to have any dignity or honor
[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:49.880]  or safety or liberty or freedom?
[01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:51.080]  How do we expect to have anything
[01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:53.160]  when our government embraces communist China
[01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:56.000]  and puts their flags up down Pennsylvania Avenue
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:56.840]  and at the White House?
[01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:58.280]  Something never before done.
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:04.320]  How do you expect us to have any future
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:07.400]  when all these different shows on TV fiction shows
[01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:11.080]  glorify secret arrest, secret wiretapping, secret torture?
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:14.320]  And it's always done in a situational ethic
[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:16.800]  where it's the right thing to do to torture.
[01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:20.120]  They're getting us ready.
[01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:21.880]  You think people dying almost every day
[01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:23.680]  from being electrocuted by tasers
[01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:25.880]  and other stun guns by the police
[01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:29.880]  for sometimes just arguing a little bit?
[01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:31.680]  Do you think it's gonna stop there?
[01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:34.720]  Now they're upping the power of the tasers.
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:38.640]  They're just getting everyone trained to accept this.
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:40.840]  It took Hitler seven years
[01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:43.840]  to really get Germany into a hardcore tyranny.
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:46.080]  And the globalists are doing it over several decades,
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:48.600]  but now we're reaching that quickening point,
[01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:50.080]  that acceleration point.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.560]  Man, I'm shook up, I tell ya.
[01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:56.360]  I would think that I would be acclimated and prepared for this,
[01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:57.800]  but to see it unfolding,
[01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:01.040]  and it's just gonna get worse and worse until we say no.
[01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:03.080]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons
[01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:05.520]  you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:07.720]  Number one, new climate legislation
[01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:09.880]  could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:12.800]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control
[01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:15.600]  how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:18.480]  It's true, total government control of electricity
[01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:21.240]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:23.520]  Number three, in some areas of the country,
[01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:25.640]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:27.920]  And now new socialist legislation
[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:29.560]  is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:32.080]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:33.120]  to local grids.
[01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:35.440]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power
[01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:36.840]  from weather-related onages.
[01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:38.880]  Number five, a solar power generator
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:41.800]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:43.880]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:45.400]  offered by Solutions from Science,
[01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:46.800]  one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:55.000]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun,
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.960]  so go to mysolarbackup.com,
[01:05:56.960 --> 01:06:00.840]  or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:02.720]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce
[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:04.680]  the anthem of the Patriot Movement.
[01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:07.520]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker
[01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:08.960]  with a qualifying purchase.
[01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:12.280]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices
[01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:13.680]  while keeping Americans working.
[01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:19.600]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:24.480]  Not worried about them moving itself, closing the doors
[01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:29.240]  and shutting it down tomorrow.
[01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:34.920]  I'm looking for America.
[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:36.560]  Wear American and be proud.
[01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:40.520]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:43.680]  Land on a free and my home of the brave.
[01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:49.680]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:52.680]  Long gone.
[01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:55.360]  But I know in my heart it's still there.
[01:06:55.360 --> 01:07:00.760]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America today.
[01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:02.960]  Alex told you the government announced recently
[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:04.320]  that the recession is over.
[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:06.600]  It ended on June of 2009.
[01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:08.880]  The millions of Americans unable to find work
[01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:10.080]  might not agree.
[01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:12.760]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government
[01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:14.320]  employees, but for the rest of us,
[01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:16.040]  things seemed to be getting worse.
[01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:18.160]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:21.120]  They've begun their long expected journey to the moon.
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:23.400]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars
[01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:26.160]  into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings
[01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:27.680]  account from eFoodsDirect.
[01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:29.840]  They both make fabulous investments.
[01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:31.880]  Food is our greatest dependency and we
[01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:35.200]  know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:37.920]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis
[01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:40.440]  and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:43.240]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious easy
[01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:45.880]  fixed meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:47.720]  This will freeze the cost to your food
[01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:49.040]  while you can still afford it.
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:54.880]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.

[01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:03.240]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network
[01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:06.480]  proudly presents the Alex Jones show
[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:11.000]  because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:14.400]  All over the nation, from Tennessee to California,
[01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:18.040]  from New York to Texas, they're having regular army,
[01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:25.840]  regular Marines, Army National Guard, running checkpoints.
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:27.800]  Even when the governor a year and a half ago,
[01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:29.600]  and this is in police state for the rise of FEMA,
[01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:33.320]  that seminal documentary that everyone must see.
[01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:35.520]  The governor, and we even had a state rep on about this,
[01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:38.000]  said, stop having Homeland Security and the army run
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.120]  random checkpoints on major highways.
[01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:41.000]  This is my state.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.440]  You're freaking people out.
[01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:44.880]  They were going into small towns, big highways,
[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:48.560]  shutting it down, searching everybody, video on the news.
[01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:50.640]  And Homeland Security said, we're not going to stop.
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:52.280]  We're going to keep doing it.
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:55.200]  And now all over the country, we showed you this last hour,
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:58.520]  they're putting up signs everywhere
[01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:01.200]  in front of propane tanks that say, Homeland Security,
[01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:04.400]  you now can't park here at this 7-Eleven or this grocery store.
[01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:06.560]  You know, you pull up at the grocery store of the 7-Eleven,
[01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:08.920]  they got the propane tanks.
[01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:10.840]  It's saying Homeland Security says can't park here.
[01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:12.640]  It's like federal zoning.
[01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:17.280]  It's a federal power grab outside of their jurisdiction.
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:19.600]  And yesterday, they had all these fake scares
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:22.080]  with fake pipe bombs everywhere that they blow up
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:23.240]  to get rid of the evidence.
[01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:25.920]  And so many times it comes out at stage, part of a drill.
[01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:28.720]  I have caught the state police with Homeland Security
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:31.480]  before it was even called Homeland Security via FEMA,
[01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:36.080]  staging fake nuclear spills and telling people they were real.
[01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:39.680]  In 98, 99, 2000, this is their program
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:41.920]  to smoke screen their federal takeover
[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:45.240]  ahead of the admissions that were going into a full collapse.
[01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:47.800]  We have the Model States Health Emergency Powers Act
[01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:52.240]  admitting plans for forced inoculations nationwide.
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:55.440]  In the film, NME of the state that we sell at infowars.com,
[01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:57.840]  they have interviews with the law enforcement people
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:00.880]  who were trained to take you forcibly to a sports stadium
[01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:01.880]  and inoculate you.
[01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:03.560]  But this is all admitted.
[01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:05.440]  One thing to have the documents that are public,
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:07.560]  but nothing to have the people that were trained for it.
[01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:08.560]  They're training the military.
[01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:09.760]  And every time they have a crisis,
[01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:12.080]  an excuse to confiscate guns.
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:13.840]  I had the Army Colonel on.
[01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:17.120]  That's also in police state for last year
[01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:20.240]  who openly admitted in Arcadia, Iowa.
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:22.120]  They went and asked the local gun dealer
[01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:23.760]  to play the part of a right winger
[01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:25.120]  who wouldn't turn his guns in.
[01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:27.320]  And they got the citizens in the town of 600
[01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:29.800]  to allow door-to-door gun confiscation drills
[01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:31.840]  where the police came in and simulated
[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:35.520]  taking their guns with the military.
[01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:37.600]  And there's hundreds and hundreds of other cases.
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:39.400]  I've made four police state films
[01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:43.120]  just replete with footage of it, much of which I shot.
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:45.160]  Footage where Marines walk up
[01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:48.520]  in the middle of Hebron, Maryland, a small Mayberry town
[01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:50.280]  and say, turn your camera off.
[01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:51.720]  You're not going to videotape this
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:53.280]  because they were going in houses
[01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:55.320]  to do simulated gun confiscations.
[01:10:55.320 --> 01:11:00.600]  And they do the drills and say it's for America.
[01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:02.920]  I was there in 99 in Operation Urban Warrior
[01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:05.720]  with 2,000 Marines, thousands of other foreign troops.
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:08.800]  Dutch, German, British, Australian,
[01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:12.480]  Israeli, French, at the local university
[01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:14.400]  with role players from the university,
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:16.880]  screaming, I'm an American, please no, not the camp,
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:19.280]  with the military admitting to me in interviews,
[01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:22.640]  the Marines, the Marine Colonel,
[01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:24.800]  that this was for America.
[01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:27.120]  Then I went home to the hotel that night,
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:28.600]  turned on CNN who'd been there,
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:31.600]  and they said, training for Macedonia.
[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:37.080]  I mean, this is incredible.
[01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:39.880]  They are doing this everywhere.
[01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:43.240]  Oh, man.
[01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:46.440]  When they enroll people in Fallujah, Iraq,
[01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:48.920]  or in Bagram, Afghanistan on record,
[01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:51.640]  it's MIT government-designed face scanning.
[01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:53.640]  They stop everybody at checkpoints, get their names,
[01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:56.400]  put them into it, take the men in for a week or so,
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:12:00.320]  interrogate them in a FEMA camp, turn them loose.
[01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:02.160]  And I've got Tom Brokaw on video.
[01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:04.120]  It was his last week on air.
[01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:05.960]  I've got him on VHS, I played it here.
[01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:07.280]  I've got it somewhere around the office,
[01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:10.800]  where he said, in Iraq, outside Fallujah,
[01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:12.520]  if you're caught without your biometric ID card,
[01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:15.360]  once you've been put in this, you are killed on the spot.
[01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:18.440]  And they're now bringing those troops back here
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:21.360]  to be police officers who, okay, you don't have your ID,
[01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:22.600]  take them over here to a ditch,
[01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:25.440]  and they shoot them and put them in a ditch.
[01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:28.600]  I remember, Private Gruckheimer in Ithaca News,
[01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:30.240]  in Afghanistan, he came back and he said,
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:32.400]  yeah, we took out the terrorists,
[01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:33.920]  we'd go into entire villages and kill
[01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:35.680]  men, women, and children, including babies,
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:38.600]  and then Fox News responded with an army general,
[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:39.800]  saying, well, let's be clear,
[01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:42.160]  only in certain villages do we kill everyone.
[01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:44.720]  They don't even deny it.
[01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:47.640]  I mean, they have forged an army of Satan.
[01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:50.720]  And if we don't admit that our military's been taken over,
[01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:53.120]  am I saying the German people were inherently bad?
[01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:58.120]  Am I saying the German Weimar Republic was completely evil?
[01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:03.200]  No, they were taken over and turned into agents of evil.
[01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:05.080]  And that's why the Germans went ahead and followed orders.
[01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:06.520]  Well, I can't say no to the military.
[01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:08.040]  I got to support the troops.
[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:10.200]  This is what happens in a tyranny.
[01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:11.480]  And the good news is we've reached out
[01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:12.680]  to the military and police.
[01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:13.680]  They're really waking up,
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:16.600]  but we need to have them wake up even faster.
[01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:19.720]  And here it is, I have the Daily Mail, the Examiner,
[01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:24.840]  and other reports confirming that they are being held
[01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:26.840]  at the army base.
[01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:33.840]  My crew has been held at an army base in Pittsburgh under FEMA,
[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:36.880]  for no reason.
[01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:37.840]  It's all on footage.
[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:39.520]  We even sent the footage to lawyers
[01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:41.560]  that are part of a class action suit.
[01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:42.960]  Do's footage is key.
[01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:46.000]  Do's up on a hillside showing the troops come in,
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.600]  the National Guard and the police to the university.
[01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:51.200]  Everyone followed orders basically
[01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:52.400]  and would not be on the streets at night.
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:53.960]  They were told, don't be on the streets.
[01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:54.800]  You're not allowed to be.
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:56.040]  So they said, where can we find people
[01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:58.160]  that'll be out at night so we can get some training
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:01.600]  on citizens, get our dogs a taste of American blood?
[01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:04.360]  And they said, well, it's going over to the university.
[01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:06.200]  And so there's the park.
[01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:08.880]  The university people are out there eating pizza
[01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:11.000]  and listening to music by the hundreds.
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.440]  There's dorms all around it.
[01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:15.280]  The military even went into dorms arresting people.
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:16.520]  It was like planted of the apes.
[01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:19.280]  That scene where Heston and folks are running away
[01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:21.160]  from the apes with the primitive humans
[01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:23.280]  being hit over the head and grabbed in nets.
[01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:24.240]  I mean, that's the footage.
[01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:26.120]  Then they march up the hill to do
[01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:28.000]  and they're just looking at him with pure hate.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:29.800]  And they're like, who are you?
[01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:30.920]  Well, I'm media.
[01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:31.800]  Where's your ID?
[01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:33.600]  You don't have a pass to be part of the G20.
[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:35.360]  G20 is like five miles away.
[01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:37.840]  And they said, well, no, I'm just here.
[01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:40.200]  And they said, put your camera on the ground.
[01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:42.040]  They put him in handcuffs, put everybody else in handcuffs,
[01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:43.520]  take him to a military base.
[01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:47.600]  And he said, those police and military were just pure hate.
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:50.120]  And just like, they would take people
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:52.920]  and take them to the porta potty inside the base
[01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:55.760]  and then look at them and laugh at their genitals.
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:58.880]  I mean, it was just like one inch away
[01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:02.000]  from full bore concentration camp.
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.800]  And then we get the Model States Emergency Powers Act.
[01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:07.520]  We get the FEMA Public Plans.
[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:10.160]  We get the Emergency Centers Act.
[01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:12.600]  And it's everything that we reverse engineered
[01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:14.440]  from all the other operations we covered.
[01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:16.800]  How they're gonna build these giant centers
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:18.160]  outside every major city.
[01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:19.680]  And they've already got them in place.
[01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:24.400]  12 years ago, they had the old airport.
[01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:26.040]  That's in police state to the takeover.
[01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:27.200]  Where the local news admits, yes,
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:29.120]  it's used to hold citizens during civil unrest,
[01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:30.840]  where they chain you down to the floor.
[01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:34.520]  Pier 57 during the 2004 Republican Convention.
[01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:36.240]  I've gotten all this on take.
[01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:39.320]  Taking peaceful people there.
[01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:41.520]  No Miranda, no nothing, chaining them down.
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:45.600]  And how they're gonna introduce this to society
[01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:47.120]  through the threat fusion centers
[01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:50.680]  that are the spy federal command bases for the roundups.
[01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:54.760]  Then we put all this in an hour special.
[01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:56.840]  He gets top ratings on true TV
[01:15:56.840 --> 01:16:01.840]  and Homeland Security ADL and Congressman Cohen
[01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:04.520]  behind the scenes start demanding it be taken off the air.
[01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:05.760]  It's pulled off the air.
[01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:07.120]  Now they're pulling more of it off the air.
[01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:10.320]  Now they're remote erasing it off DVRs in your house.
[01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:11.360]  That's confirmed.
[01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:15.520]  And what does Cohen say?
[01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:18.400]  He's out there calling Republicans Nazis
[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:20.840]  and saying that anybody who criticizes government
[01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:22.200]  caused the shooting when it's admitted
[01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:23.760]  it was nothing but mental illness.
[01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:26.000]  And the guy was anything a liberal.
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.440]  That's what all his friends and everybody said.
[01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:29.400]  That doesn't blame Democrats.
[01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:31.880]  And this is the guy right here instrumental
[01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:33.320]  in getting that pulled off TV.
[01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:35.280]  This guy would love to live in China.
[01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:37.800]  Here he is with Anderson CIA, Cooper.
[01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:39.080]  Here it is.
[01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:41.400]  And Cohen, how can you think that it's appropriate
[01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:43.320]  for a member of Congress on the floor of the house
[01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:45.440]  to compare the statements made by Republicans
[01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:47.760]  about health care to lies about Jews
[01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:49.560]  told by Joseph Goebbels and other Nazis?
[01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:50.920]  How is that appropriate?
[01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:52.640]  Well, appropriate because it was the same process.
[01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:54.920]  Obviously, I don't think Republicans are Nazis,
[01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:57.400]  but they used the same means that Goebbels used,
[01:16:57.400 --> 01:16:59.760]  which was to have a short, concise idea
[01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:01.960]  and repeat it over and over and over again.
[01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:03.640]  But you're essentially comparing them to Nazis.
[01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:04.720]  No, I don't think I wasn't.
[01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:05.760]  I certainly didn't intend to.
[01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:10.760]  And when you do a open session like that on the floor,
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:12.080]  you speak off the cuff.
[01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:15.600]  But now Goebbels was the master of political propaganda.
[01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:18.400]  And as evil a man as he was, he was the master of this.
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:21.080]  And when people use it and use lies
[01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:22.600]  over and over and over again,
[01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:24.280]  whether it's killing grandma,
[01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:26.720]  whether it's government health takeover of health care
[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:28.000]  or any of those things,
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:31.000]  somebody has to stand up and say, hey, wait a minute, lie.
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.680]  If you weren't trying to compare them to Nazis,
[01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:33.880]  you wouldn't have mentioned Nazis.
[01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:35.520]  I mean, you said their statements on health care
[01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:37.680]  are the same kind of lies that Nazis told.
[01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:39.240]  I didn't say Nazis.
[01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:40.080]  I said Goebbels.
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:42.520]  He's the chief propagandist for the Nazi party.
[01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:43.360]  And you said that,
[01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:45.400]  and you said the Germans told lies about the Jews
[01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:46.520]  and that led to the Holocaust.
[01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:48.480]  You're saying they're doing the same kind of thing
[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:49.320]  that the Nazis did.
[01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:50.480]  That's comparing them.
[01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:52.000]  Well, I didn't intend to do that.
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:52.840]  I didn't think I did.
[01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:54.960]  He is the master of political propagandists.
[01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:57.920]  And if he wrote traitors on it, he had rules.
[01:17:57.920 --> 01:17:59.200]  He is the major person.
[01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:01.640]  If you want to talk about political propaganda,
[01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:03.880]  the person you talk about who mastered it
[01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:06.040]  in terms of the big lie was Goebbels.
[01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:07.000]  So you're standing by this.
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.160]  You don't think it's inappropriate in any way?
[01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:11.640]  Well, I think as far as the lie goes,
[01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:12.800]  and I've been writing about lies
[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:15.400]  in the political spectrum for the last two months,
[01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:17.520]  there was a show that said that the government
[01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:19.640]  was creating concentration camps
[01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:21.960]  and planned to have a pandemic against its citizens.
[01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:23.760]  This was something on the true TV.
[01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:26.200]  Yeah, that's just even Turen's ridiculous conspiracy show,
[01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:27.040]  which is just a joke.
[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:27.880]  But I mean-
[01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:28.720]  It's not a joke.
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:29.680]  I wrote an op-ed about it.
[01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:31.920]  That's the kind of stuff that produces Oklahoma cities,
[01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:34.760]  produced two deputy sheriffs being killed in West Memphis.
[01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:36.280]  But Democrats have been very critical
[01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:38.080]  when people on the right use Nazi imagery
[01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:40.000]  to describe President Obama or Democrats.
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:41.600]  I just don't understand why you think it's okay
[01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:45.800]  to bring in Nazis when you're talking about Republicans.
[01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:49.600]  I think that when it's an appropriate analogy,
[01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:53.800]  and if you wanted to talk about some monster scientist,
[01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:55.000]  and you mentioned Mengele,
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.160]  it would be appropriate because he was the monster scientist
[01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:01.000]  of the last 100 years or maybe of all time.
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:01.840]  Just as-
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:04.320]  Yeah, and Mr. Steve Cohen, the congressman,
[01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:05.760]  it's now even come out in the New York Times,
[01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:07.160]  what we knew decades ago,
[01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:10.000]  that our government took tens of thousands of top Nazis,
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:13.120]  including Mengele and protected them.
[01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:16.240]  Oh, but you don't want to talk about that.
[01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:19.600]  You want to take a show like Ventura's and imply,
[01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:20.440]  or no, you didn't imply,
[01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:24.200]  he said that causes Oklahoma cities and police being killed.
[01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:28.400]  They go and interview the heads of threat fusion centers.
[01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:31.160]  They go and interview former, you know, top FBI agent
[01:19:31.160 --> 01:19:35.160]  who got out over it and works for the ACLU, exposing it.
[01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:38.040]  They went and interviewed, I mean, they went and showed,
[01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:40.520]  they went to that congressman and showed him his own bill,
[01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:42.160]  and he denied he'd even introduced it
[01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:43.880]  and then later had to admit it.
[01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:46.320]  Four of the FEMA camps in America that are already built,
[01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:48.160]  they're just saying, fund them more.
[01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:51.280]  I mean, it's in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act.
[01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:53.840]  They've got a massive civil unrest roundup plan,
[01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:55.600]  and they're just getting everybody used to it.
[01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:57.760]  You know, Hitler first put the Jews in the camps,
[01:19:57.760 --> 01:19:58.600]  then he put others.
[01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:01.280]  Now they're putting the mafia in camps, then it's others.
[01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:05.200]  New year, new way to smoke, and it's totally wicked.
[01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:08.120]  Introducing totally wicked e-liquid electronic cigarettes,
[01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:10.440]  the highest quality e-cigarettes in the world.
[01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:12.240]  With totally wicked e-liquid cigarettes,
[01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:15.200]  there's no flame, no secondhand smoke, no carbon monoxide,
[01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:17.560]  no tar, no unsightly brown teeth or fingers,
[01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:19.360]  and no lingering smell.
[01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:20.960]  Totally wicked e-liquid cigarettes
[01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:23.320]  have a battery charge that lasts up to eight hours.
[01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:25.320]  Plus with a totally wicked tornado model,
[01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:27.480]  the average pack a day smoker is likely
[01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:29.520]  to save over $1,000 a year.
[01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:31.960]  The totally wicked tornado provides a storm of vapor.

[01:20:56.760 --> 01:20:59.680]  The next generation of alternative smoking.
[01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:03.960]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years,
[01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:06.000]  hoping to build up enough wealth to retire
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:07.640]  and live out their golden years.
[01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:09.440]  Unfortunately, with taxation,
[01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:12.680]  the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical,
[01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:15.760]  many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:17.360]  Is this a flaw for enterprise,
[01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:19.800]  or is our monetary unit, we call the Federal Reserve Note,
[01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:21.680]  forcing us into perpetual debt,
[01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:23.960]  ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:25.640]  These questions and more can be answered
[01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:27.440]  by reading G. Edward Griffin's book,
[01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:29.000]  The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:30.640]  Congressman Ron Paul states,
[01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:32.200]  it's what every American needs to know
[01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:34.200]  about central bank power.
[01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:36.360]  A gripping adventure into the secret world
[01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:38.440]  of international banking cartel.
[01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:39.640]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:42.120]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s
[01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:44.160]  to anyone who purchases this book.
[01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:49.040]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:52.040]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:56.880]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:56.880 --> 01:21:59.960]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:03.600]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny
[01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:05.360]  in the last century alone.
[01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:08.600]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:10.960]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:13.840]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:17.880]  I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress,
[01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:19.760]  and they really are calling the shots.
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:22.640]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:25.000]  as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:28.280]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:30.480]  The criminal offshore cartel
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:32.680]  held bent on destroying sovereignty
[01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:35.120]  and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:37.480]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:39.040]  They're asking for more matches.
[01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:41.480]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:43.600]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:45.880]  And right now in Washington, D.C.,
[01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:48.760]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:50.840]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic
[01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:53.760]  on DVD at infowars.com.

[01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:01.640]  Is it really possible to get out of debt
[01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:03.560]  without payment plans or attorneys?
[01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:05.640]  18 years ago, we developed a program
[01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:08.440]  that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:10.440]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days,
[01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:12.440]  and it works for all credit card debt,
[01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:14.640]  medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:17.040]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:18.840]  So I used the program methods,
[01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:21.320]  and after filing one piece of paper,
[01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:23.200]  the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:24.520]  With Zero Debt in 90 Days,
[01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:26.600]  your success is guaranteed in writing.
[01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:28.440]  There is no other program of its kind.
[01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:30.640]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:32.680]  Let our team of experts provide the resources
[01:23:32.680 --> 01:23:36.320]  to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days, guaranteed.
[01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:38.200]  Prevent wage garnishments, bank levies,
[01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:40.600]  and stop collection calls with our proven program.

[01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:16.640]  MUSIC
[01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:22.600]  So, Congressman Cohen, Steve Cohen, tells us there's no police
[01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:25.240]  state, and everybody sees an unfolding
[01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:27.560]  with the telescreens going in, Homeland Security
[01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:30.080]  announcing the takeover of society.
[01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:31.760]  He and others have been calling for restrictions
[01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:32.600]  on free speech.
[01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:35.040]  Thank gosh Lieberman is retiring,
[01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:36.600]  a guy that's openly called for restricting
[01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:38.120]  free speech in this country,
[01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:40.920]  along with Senator Rockefeller and others.
[01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:45.920]  And this is just a few minutes from the censored,
[01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:49.840]  banned, memory-hold police state episode
[01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:52.280]  that explains it all, the 10 FEMA regions.
[01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:54.360]  And Ventura ends it with,
[01:24:54.360 --> 01:24:56.200]  you thought your Congress was running things?
[01:24:56.200 --> 01:24:57.880]  No, there are 10 governors that run it.
[01:24:57.880 --> 01:25:00.320]  That's in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act
[01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:01.520]  that I freaked out about.
[01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:04.600]  It says 10 governors will control all the other states
[01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:06.400]  and will take over states if they don't follow
[01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:07.600]  federal orders.
[01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:09.640]  What do you think the EPA's doing in Texas?
[01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:12.120]  They can't get Congress to pass the carbon taxes,
[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:13.080]  so they've come down here and
[01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:15.520]  regulatorily sees with no law,
[01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:20.080]  our power plants that power five surrounding states.
[01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:25.080]  Texas is the number one power producer in North America.
[01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:27.640]  This is brazen.
[01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:30.320]  It's dictatorship when Obama can give exemptions
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:32.080]  to all the big companies like McDonald's
[01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:35.000]  that give him money from not having to buy insurance
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:36.880]  for their employees.
[01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:40.080]  Or it came out that companies that didn't give money,
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:42.120]  people that own dealerships, GM dealerships
[01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:43.360]  that didn't give money to the Democrats,
[01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:46.600]  had them shut down, had them given to Democratic friends.
[01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:48.840]  That's like Roman Caesars would do.
[01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:51.560]  And I could go for 10 hours with examples.
[01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:55.240]  Let's get to the Ventura clip of this censor Cohen,
[01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:57.520]  this guy who thinks he controls your television set now,
[01:25:57.520 --> 01:25:59.440]  and I guess he does, who's up there saying
[01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:01.040]  this is gonna cause a new Oklahoma city.
[01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:01.880]  Here it is.
[01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:08.360]  Ha ha ha.
[01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:10.880]  Congressman Steve Cohen of Tennessee agreed
[01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:12.560]  to talk about the bill.
[01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:15.040]  Remember, he's a cosponsor.
[01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:18.120]  I'm here to talk to you about these FEMA camps.
[01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:20.520]  I'm very disturbed about them.
[01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:23.320]  Why would we be building these things all over the country
[01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:24.560]  for what purpose?
[01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:27.760]  Well, we wouldn't because they don't exist.
[01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:31.400]  It's just a figment of some people who have concerns
[01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:35.600]  about maybe Martians or other creatures
[01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:37.400]  coming to infiltrate our society,
[01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:39.200]  thinking that there are such camps.
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:40.280]  But there are no such camps.
[01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:43.600]  There are no such, so why was it put into that bill?
[01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:46.840]  It's in a bill, so it's put into the bill,
[01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:48.920]  it doesn't exist, there are no FEMA camps
[01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:50.080]  anywhere in America.
[01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:51.440]  No, there aren't.
[01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:54.040]  What was the place I saw in Texas?
[01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:56.360]  I don't know what it was called, a residence.
[01:26:56.360 --> 01:27:00.120]  It had two 20 foot high fences around it.
[01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:02.200]  When I knocked on the door, it was locked.
[01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:05.080]  When the people came to the door, no comment
[01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:07.520]  was the answer I got on any question.
[01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:10.320]  And what disturbed me the most about this place
[01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:12.280]  was in the back, it was like a daycare.
[01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:15.280]  There's slides and swings for children.
[01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:18.320]  And I said, do you keep children inside this place?
[01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:19.160]  No comment.
[01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:21.400]  Have you ever kept children in this place?
[01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:22.680]  No comment.
[01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:24.360]  I haven't been there, so I have no idea.
[01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:25.800]  Maybe they're immature people.
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:28.920]  So you're telling me there isn't one FEMA camp of these
[01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:30.800]  in the United States right now?
[01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:31.960]  There are not.
[01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:33.960]  Why is it in that bill?
[01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:35.160]  What is exactly in the bill?
[01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:38.000]  It talks about building FEMA camps, doesn't it?
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.760]  Is that particular bill that we're talking about?
[01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:45.080]  I would have to, I'd like to see the bill.
[01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:50.560]  Isn't this guy a co-sponsor of the bill?
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:51.560]  What's the bill number?
[01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:53.560]  It's 645.
[01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:54.720]  It should be FEMA camps.
[01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:56.720]  They're built within the United States.
[01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:59.400]  How can a bill state that there'll be six FEMA camps
[01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:00.800]  built in the United States?
[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:02.720]  And then I'm being told there are none.
[01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:07.040]  Well, I think I recall now something about this.
[01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:09.360]  And if I'm correct, I think those
[01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:13.160]  are locations for if there's a disaster like in Katrina,
[01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:14.160]  I think that's what it is.
[01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:16.520]  It's not any kind of a concentration camp
[01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:18.880]  or anything to round up citizens.
[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:21.120]  Thinks that's what it is?
[01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:24.400]  The bill that he co-sponsored says the use of the camps
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:28.560]  will be determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security.
[01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:30.280]  They can come and go as they please.
[01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:31.520]  They won't be locked.
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:31.960]  No, no, no.
[01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:34.560]  They can go in and out because the place I saw in Texas
[01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:35.720]  is locked.
[01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:37.640]  You can't go in and out of it.
[01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:38.760]  No comment in it.
[01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:40.800]  Well, it's not probably not being used, either.
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:43.040]  Well, we have films of children playing
[01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:45.640]  on the swings and the slides and stuff.
[01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:48.920]  And this one technically falls under Homeland Security.
[01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:50.720]  Well, I don't know if you haven't been there.
[01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:51.840]  And I don't know who the children are.
[01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:53.800]  And the children are probably very happy.
[01:28:53.800 --> 01:28:56.080]  Where have we heard that before?
[01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:01.640]  There'll probably be children of the people that
[01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:03.000]  manage the place, I imagine.
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.400]  But they're not people that have been taken there
[01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:07.720]  by some green monsters and a machine.
[01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:09.560]  I have fear of my government, not
[01:29:09.560 --> 01:29:12.920]  green monsters and machines from outer space.
[01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:16.520]  I have enough fear from here.
[01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:19.480]  You can see how things work in Washington.
[01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:20.320]  Congressman Spine.
[01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:21.520]  Now, think about that.
[01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:24.480]  Now, this guy behind the scenes with Homeland Security
[01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:27.680]  and ADL pressure got that episode shut down.
[01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:29.640]  And now they're shutting other episodes down.
[01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:34.320]  And he's on TV comparing it to Hitler.
[01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:36.080]  And you've got the White House regulations
[01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:38.120]  are saying arrest people that criticize
[01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:39.680]  man-made global warming.
[01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:40.880]  Now, is that tyranny?
[01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:43.880]  Is Chinese flags on Pennsylvania Avenue tyranny?
[01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:46.160]  Is China owning our debt tyranny?
[01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:48.000]  Is our media saying tyranny's good tyranny?
[01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:53.040]  We're on the march.
[01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:55.520]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.520 --> 01:29:58.360]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:03.880]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting
[01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:08.040]  that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America
[01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:09.480]  in more than 50 years.
[01:30:09.480 --> 01:30:12.040]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:14.760]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children,
[01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:17.400]  and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:19.600]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions
[01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:20.440]  over the years.
[01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:22.760]  The crazy part is he's usually right.
[01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:25.080]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM,
[01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:27.080]  Panny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest
[01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:28.960]  small-owner general growth properties.
[01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:32.360]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:34.120]  Recently, he created a video which
[01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:36.560]  you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest
[01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:38.160]  and most important prediction yet,
[01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:39.720]  and it's a real eye-opener.
[01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:41.080]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:30:41.080 --> 01:30:43.760]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:45.400]  He explains everything you need to know,
[01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:48.000]  including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:52.640]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.

[01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:02.400]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons
[01:32:02.400 --> 01:32:04.840]  you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:07.040]  Number one, new climate legislation
[01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:09.200]  could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:12.120]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control
[01:32:12.120 --> 01:32:14.960]  how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:17.840]  It's true, total government control of electricity
[01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:20.560]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:22.840]  Number three, in some areas of the country,
[01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:25.000]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.280]  And now, new socialist legislation
[01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:28.880]  is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:30.600]  Number four, dangerous weather
[01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:32.440]  is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:34.760]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power
[01:32:34.760 --> 01:32:36.160]  from weather-related onages.
[01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:38.200]  Number five, a solar power generator
[01:32:38.200 --> 01:32:41.120]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:43.200]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:44.760]  offered by Solutions from Science,
[01:32:44.760 --> 01:32:46.160]  one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:13.360]  MUSIC
[01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:19.360]  You can run on for a long time, run on for a long time,
[01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:22.360]  run on for a long time.
[01:33:22.360 --> 01:33:25.360]  Sooner or later, gotta cut you down,
[01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:29.360]  Sooner or later, gotta cut you down.
[01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:32.360]  Go tell that long-tongued liar,
[01:33:32.360 --> 01:33:35.360]  Go and tell that mid-line liar.
[01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:38.360]  If enough of us speak out, maybe next time,
[01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:41.360]  we can talk some sense into our leaders
[01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:44.360]  before they sign on the dotted line.
[01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:50.360]  MUSIC
[01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:55.360]  Stop! Stop!
[01:33:55.360 --> 01:34:00.360]  MUSIC
[01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:02.360]  They said it couldn't happen here,
[01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:04.360]  but it already is happening.
[01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:07.360]  And we've already allowed our elected officials
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:11.360]  to break all kinds of laws designed to protect you and me.
[01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:14.360]  You thought we had 50 states?
[01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:18.360]  Nope, we've learned there's 10 sectors ruled by 10 people
[01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:20.360]  you didn't vote for.
[01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:22.360]  You support your local police?
[01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:26.360]  That's nothing, not when they've got the military ready to take over.
[01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:29.360]  You signed a petition outside the supermarket?
[01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:32.360]  Who knows what list you're on now?
[01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:34.360]  And what about all these detention centers?
[01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:38.360]  Why do you think the standard answer is no comment?
[01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:40.360]  And here's what's worse.
[01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:43.360]  They're doing it all in the name of national security.
[01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:45.360]  Talk about the fear factor.
[01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:47.360]  I've said it before and I'll say it now.
[01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:51.360]  I'd rather face the dangers than lose my freedom.
[01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:55.360]  I'm Jesse Ventura and this is Conspiracy Theory.
[01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:59.360]  MUSIC
[01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:01.360]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:04.360]  I have Dr. Jerome Corsi off the next 30 minutes or so
[01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:06.360]  to talk about the incredible headlines
[01:35:06.360 --> 01:35:09.360]  Hawaii Governor can't find Obama birth certificate
[01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:11.360]  suggests controversy could hurt
[01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:13.360]  President's reelection chances.
[01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:15.360]  Here's the Daily Mail.
[01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:18.360]  The Hawaiian Governor claims record of Obama's births
[01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:21.360]  exist in archives but can't produce the vital document.
[01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:24.360]  So he did this big throwing down the gauntlet a few weeks ago
[01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:27.360]  and now he can't produce it.
[01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:30.360]  And the man who has been tirelessly on this case,
[01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:32.360]  here's Media Matters, George Soros' mouthpiece,
[01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:36.360]  Corsi's pathological quest to prove Obama is Kenyan continuous.
[01:35:36.360 --> 01:35:38.360]  Well, he didn't really believe it years ago
[01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:40.360]  until he went to Kenyan, they arrested him
[01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:43.360]  when he was trying to kidnap him, basically detained him.
[01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:45.360]  And now he's certainly on to something
[01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:47.360]  and we know he gave up his citizenship
[01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:49.360]  when he was in Indonesia, he lied about that,
[01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:52.360]  he lied about going to the mosque and being a Muslim.
[01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:54.360]  Not that it's bad that he's a Muslim,
[01:35:54.360 --> 01:35:56.360]  but why would he cover that up?
[01:35:56.360 --> 01:35:59.360]  But it's good that we have Dr. Corsi on
[01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:02.360]  because he is an expert, as I am as well,
[01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:05.360]  on the 10 FEMA regions, on the Emergency Centers Act,
[01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:07.360]  on the John Warner Defense Authorization Act.
[01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:09.360]  He wrote about it as a conservative
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:12.360]  and criticized that when Bush was in, he continues to.
[01:36:12.360 --> 01:36:15.360]  But the left controlling this country,
[01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:17.360]  by the same Wall Street interest,
[01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:20.360]  are accelerating Homeland Security at shopping malls,
[01:36:20.360 --> 01:36:22.360]  Homeland Security signs, telescreens,
[01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:25.360]  going up at 9,000 malls and wallmards.
[01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:27.360]  I mean, it's all happening,
[01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:31.360]  and now we have Congressman Steve Cohen
[01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:34.360]  calling Republicans Nazis, Goebbels,
[01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:36.360]  and trying to say that it's their fault
[01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:39.360]  that this guy who, before he went completely schizophrenic,
[01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:42.360]  was a, quote, very liberal pothead.
[01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:45.360]  They are now trying to restrict free speech.
[01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:48.360]  A huge article from Steve Watson
[01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:50.360]  at PrismPlanet.com.
[01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:53.360]  Obama may call for gun control during State of the Union.
[01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:57.360]  We also have the Examiner and the New York Daily News
[01:36:57.360 --> 01:37:00.360]  reporting that they're holding these 100 mafia people
[01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:02.360]  at a military base.
[01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:06.360]  This is the slow rollout of this Homeland Security grid.
[01:37:06.360 --> 01:37:10.360]  So I wanted to get Dr. Corsi first to talk about
[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:14.360]  the Governor's Council that he's really been researching.
[01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:16.360]  I've even had Jagged former, you know,
[01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:18.360]  colonels on who were saying it's very dangerous,
[01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:20.360]  and where all this is going,
[01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:22.360]  and what he thinks of Cass Sunstein calling
[01:37:22.360 --> 01:37:24.360]  for arresting global warming skeptics,
[01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:27.360]  what he thinks of Cohen behind the scenes,
[01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:30.360]  now admitting that he pressured Time Warner
[01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:33.360]  to shut down Ventura's episode on the police state,
[01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:36.360]  which, from the research, it's all documented.
[01:37:36.360 --> 01:37:39.360]  I mean, these are really dark times when Pennsylvania Avenue
[01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:42.360]  is lined with the bloodiest flag in history
[01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:44.360]  of the murderous Communist Chinese.
[01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:47.360]  Our media is telling us how the Singapore-slash
[01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:50.360]  Communist Chinese model is the model for the world.
[01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:53.360]  We're told China's now our owner.
[01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:55.360]  I mean, this stuff is accelerating.
[01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:57.360]  Is it not, Dr. Corsi?
[01:37:57.360 --> 01:37:59.360]  Well, I think all the concerns are legitimate.
[01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:01.360]  Alex and I share your concerns.
[01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:04.360]  Representative Cohen today issued a statement
[01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:06.360]  of non-apology-apology.
[01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:09.360]  You know, like, I'm not sorry for what I said,
[01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:12.360]  but I'm sorry if it may have offended some people,
[01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:14.360]  the kind of way Cohen approached it.
[01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:17.360]  And I thought that was really disingenuous.
[01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:21.360]  I mean, here, right after all the left is out saying,
[01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:23.360]  we've got to tone down the vitriol,
[01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:25.360]  Cohen is on the floor of the House
[01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:28.360]  accusing Republicans of being naughty,
[01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:30.360]  and that's just unacceptable.
[01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:33.360]  The Democrats to have this double standard
[01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:36.360]  that applies to anybody except those on the left.
[01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:38.360]  Well, it's not just a double standard.
[01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:40.360]  We've seen Obama say they bring a knife, we bring a gun.
[01:38:40.360 --> 01:38:42.360]  We've seen Congressman saying he wants to line up
[01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:44.360]  Republican governors and shoot them.
[01:38:44.360 --> 01:38:47.360]  I mean, I'm nonpartisan, as you know.
[01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:49.360]  I'm just a libertarian that wants freedom.
[01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:52.360]  But I mean, all the union thugs beating people up,
[01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:56.360]  I'd say Democratic vitriol and Democrat thugs
[01:38:56.360 --> 01:38:58.360]  attacking people in the streets,
[01:38:58.360 --> 01:39:01.360]  it's got to be 10 to 1 what we see conservatives doing.
[01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:05.360]  Well, and the left has been known for this forever.
[01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:10.360]  The tactic is basically if you can't defeat your opponent
[01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:14.360]  by argument, engage in ridicule, brutality,
[01:39:14.360 --> 01:39:19.360]  anything to marginalize or beat up or intimidate your opponent.
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:21.360]  It's one of the themes that's all Linsky's,
[01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:26.360]  rules for radical, ridicule your opponent,
[01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:30.360]  engage in ad hominem attacks, marginalize them,
[01:39:30.360 --> 01:39:32.360]  personalize the attacks.
[01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:34.360]  These tactics on the left are unacceptable,
[01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:37.360]  especially for anybody, libertarian, conservative,
[01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:40.360]  whomever, trying to pursue the truth.
[01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:41.360]  I'm an investigative reporter.
[01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:44.360]  You know, Alex, I've reported and criticized
[01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:48.360]  both Republican and Democratic presidents alike.
[01:39:48.360 --> 01:39:53.360]  I was excru- got excoriated by the George Bush supporters
[01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:56.360]  when I was writing the late Craig USA and reporting
[01:39:56.360 --> 01:39:58.360]  on the North American Union and the Security and Prosperity
[01:39:58.360 --> 01:40:00.360]  Partnership in North America.
[01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:04.360]  So it's really not fair to characterize me as a Republican.
[01:40:04.360 --> 01:40:06.360]  I'm not a member of the Republican Party.
[01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:11.360]  The only party I ever joined was the Constitution Party.
[01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:13.360]  Finishing up with the 10 FEMA Regions,
[01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:15.360]  the Governor's Council, I know you've written
[01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:18.360]  some very piercing articles that concur with my analysis
[01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:21.360]  to have Cohen running around when confronted by Ventura
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:24.360]  and saying that the Emergency Centers Act did not exist
[01:40:24.360 --> 01:40:25.360]  until he was handed the bill.
[01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:28.360]  And then he goes, oh, I do remember that now.
[01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:30.360]  I mean, it's a perimation moment.
[01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:32.360]  Sylvester caught with a Tweety Bird in his mouth.
[01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:35.360]  And then he goes on to basically say there's no
[01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:37.360]  Governor's Council.
[01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:38.360]  None of this is real.
[01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:39.360]  None of this is a threat.
[01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:41.360]  I mean, is he counting on people's ignorance?
[01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:44.360]  Well, I think he is.
[01:40:44.360 --> 01:40:47.360]  And first of all, Jesse Ventura has done very good reporting.
[01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:52.360]  I think this new series Ventura has on television is excellent.
[01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:56.360]  I especially like to show on the JFK murder conspiracy.
[01:40:56.360 --> 01:40:58.360]  I thought that was particularly well done.
[01:40:58.360 --> 01:41:01.360]  Well, he broke with insiders right before
[01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:03.360]  Climategate even came out.
[01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:06.360]  He had the basic climate-gate info and exposed global warming.
[01:41:06.360 --> 01:41:07.360]  And you know Jesse went into that.
[01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:10.360]  He's got a mix of views believing it.
[01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:13.360]  And I and others convinced him and showed him the documents.
[01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:15.360]  And so he told the truth.
[01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:18.360]  I mean, he's real and that's what they don't like.
[01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:19.360]  Well, that's right.
[01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:22.360]  And I've written on the FEMA contracts.
[01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:23.360]  They've had contracts.
[01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:25.360]  I don't have them in front of me right now.
[01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:26.360]  The articles I've written.
[01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:28.360]  No, I know I sprung this on you.
[01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:29.360]  But I mean, let's talk about FEMA.
[01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:30.360]  I mean, talk about it again.
[01:41:30.360 --> 01:41:32.360]  They have had this contract out there
[01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:35.360]  for the Department of Homeland Security, legitimate contracts
[01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:38.360]  with major contractors to build detention camps
[01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:40.360]  whenever they need them for whatever reason.
[01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:42.360]  And I've got to start getting into it again.
[01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:46.360]  But the directives on National Security Directives,
[01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:48.360]  the president Bush signed,
[01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:53.360]  that basically gives the president dictatorial policy, powers,
[01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:56.360]  take over even all governments down to tribal governments
[01:41:56.360 --> 01:41:58.360]  on the presidential declaration.
[01:41:58.360 --> 01:42:01.360]  There's a national emergency without the involvement
[01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:03.360]  of Congress in that declaration.
[01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:06.360]  President Obama's actually now started expanding these powers
[01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:09.360]  with executive orders again.
[01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:13.360]  That buttressed the office of the presidency
[01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:15.360]  in a self-declared emergency,
[01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:17.360]  national emergency by the president
[01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:19.360]  to become a virtual dictator.
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:21.360]  And those are very frightening powers
[01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:24.360]  that I think, again, need to be constantly examined.
[01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:26.360]  And I need to get back to reporting on them as well.
[01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:28.360]  Well, it's going into high gear.
[01:42:28.360 --> 01:42:31.360]  And for Cohen to run around calling people Nazis
[01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:33.360]  all at the same time, a few weeks ago,
[01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:35.360]  calling to cut down the vitriol.
[01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:37.360]  We need the fairness doctrine.
[01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:40.360]  We need to have the government regulate the internet.
[01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:42.360]  I mean, there's no doubt how many czars
[01:42:42.360 --> 01:42:45.360]  have we had praised Mao or praised Chavez.
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:48.360]  We have the FCC diversity czar openly saying,
[01:42:48.360 --> 01:42:51.360]  we need Chavez-type media controls.
[01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:53.360]  I mean, these people are not liberals.
[01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:54.360]  They're authoritarians.
[01:42:54.360 --> 01:42:57.360]  Well, John Holdren saying that for population control,
[01:42:57.360 --> 01:43:01.360]  for climate control, we may need to have population control.
[01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:04.360]  We may need to consider forced sterilization.
[01:43:04.360 --> 01:43:07.360]  Look, what's going on, Alex, is very clear.
[01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:09.360]  The far left wants to control.
[01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:11.360]  They want to create a narrative.
[01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:13.360]  And the narrative they want to create is anybody
[01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:18.360]  who disagrees with them is being disruptive,
[01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:20.360]  engaging in vitriol.
[01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:23.360]  They want to demonize anybody who disagrees with them.
[01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:26.360]  And they want a double standard in which the left
[01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:28.360]  and their far extremist supporters
[01:43:28.360 --> 01:43:31.360]  can say anything they want about those who disagree with them.
[01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:36.360]  But anything, an honest critic like yourself
[01:43:36.360 --> 01:43:38.360]  or the investigations that I do,
[01:43:38.360 --> 01:43:40.360]  I'm excoriated all the time by the left,
[01:43:40.360 --> 01:43:42.360]  because we disagree, because we don't go along
[01:43:42.360 --> 01:43:45.360]  with the party line the left wants propagated,
[01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:49.360]  we're immediately demonized.
[01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:51.360]  Briefly, and then I want to get into the big news here,
[01:43:51.360 --> 01:43:54.360]  the birth certificate, where there's smoke, there's fire,
[01:43:54.360 --> 01:43:55.360]  and this is...
[01:43:55.360 --> 01:43:57.360]  I was open-minded about this two years ago
[01:43:57.360 --> 01:43:59.360]  and thought maybe it was baloney now.
[01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:02.360]  The evidence is clear, they're hiding something big.
[01:44:02.360 --> 01:44:07.360]  But just briefly, your take on the situation with China,
[01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:09.360]  what the media is doing, where they're saying,
[01:44:09.360 --> 01:44:12.360]  we could learn from China, China's good, we're bad,
[01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:16.360]  they're our new boss, what the system's trying to push there,
[01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:19.360]  and the latest tidbits on the SPP North American Union
[01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:21.360]  integration by stealth.
[01:44:21.360 --> 01:44:24.360]  Well, people have got to read by America for sale.
[01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:27.360]  I've been warning for years that we're headed
[01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:29.360]  into a globalist configuration.
[01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:31.360]  The globalists intend this.
[01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:33.360]  As again, globalists of the left and the right,
[01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:35.360]  the Bolio National Corporation,
[01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:38.360]  the Henry Kissinger and Council on Formulation,
[01:44:38.360 --> 01:44:41.360]  and the left, the open borders crowd,
[01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:43.360]  Zignu Brzezinski, it's Barack Obama,
[01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:45.360]  they want to erase borders.
[01:44:45.360 --> 01:44:50.360]  China is fine with these people because China exploits labor.
[01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:54.360]  China's a dictatorial government that is communist
[01:44:54.360 --> 01:44:57.360]  and does not tolerate free speech.
[01:44:57.360 --> 01:45:01.360]  I'll try bringing a Bible into China and see how far you get.
[01:45:01.360 --> 01:45:03.360]  Don't have too many children in China.
[01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:07.360]  Don't disagree with the government or you'll be sent to thought reform.
[01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:11.360]  And the China has a veneer of some business principles,
[01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:14.360]  does not mean that China has become a capitalist country,
[01:45:14.360 --> 01:45:17.360]  or one is not dangerous to our national interests.
[01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:20.360]  And now we're deeply indebted to China.
[01:45:20.360 --> 01:45:23.360]  And Barack Obama is in a position of having to bow,
[01:45:23.360 --> 01:45:25.360]  can object to anything.
[01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:27.360]  I thought it was disgraceful.
[01:45:27.360 --> 01:45:30.360]  It was clearly something I never expected to see in my lifetime.
[01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:34.360]  Why does he continue to Saudi, British Royals,
[01:45:34.360 --> 01:45:36.360]  communists, dictators?
[01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:39.360]  I mean, he literally bows like an errand boy,
[01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:41.360]  and they don't bow to him.
[01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:43.360]  And they even look at him like he's pathetic.
[01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:45.360]  Is this part of the humiliation of America,
[01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:47.360]  part of a larger psi-op?
[01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:49.360]  I think it's part of the whole theme, yes,
[01:45:49.360 --> 01:45:52.360]  that America is at fault.
[01:45:52.360 --> 01:45:54.360]  That we're, you know, look,
[01:45:54.360 --> 01:45:56.360]  when I wrote the Obamination, I point out Barack Obama
[01:45:56.360 --> 01:46:00.360]  comes from a far-leftist basis intellectually,
[01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:03.360]  mentors like Frank Marshall Davis, who is truly communist.
[01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:07.360]  And the narrative there is that the United States
[01:46:07.360 --> 01:46:11.360]  is a capitalist, imperialist, oppressor country
[01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:13.360]  that enslaved the blacks.
[01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:17.360]  Barack Obama also disrespects the British
[01:46:17.360 --> 01:46:19.360]  because of British colonialism,
[01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:22.360]  saying that the French are our greatest friend ever.
[01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:24.360]  Well, I mean, I can remember lots of times
[01:46:24.360 --> 01:46:26.360]  the French weren't particularly friendly to us at all.
[01:46:26.360 --> 01:46:30.360]  And here you've got a situation where America being blamed
[01:46:30.360 --> 01:46:33.360]  is the narrative out of the White House.
[01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:38.360]  The apology toward the Barack Obama ran and continues to run
[01:46:38.360 --> 01:46:40.360]  is one that, you know, does not acknowledge
[01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:44.360]  American exceptionalism, talks about slavery,
[01:46:44.360 --> 01:46:46.360]  but does not talk about the Civil War
[01:46:46.360 --> 01:46:48.360]  or the post-Civil War legislation,
[01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:50.360]  which freed the fight.
[01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:52.360]  But you don't dare talk about Hu Jin Tao
[01:46:52.360 --> 01:46:54.360]  being elected by a committee of dictators.
[01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:56.360]  You don't dare talk about that.
[01:46:56.360 --> 01:46:59.360]  Oh, how dare Harry Reid actually, you know,
[01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:03.360]  a blind pig can find acres, broken clocks are right twice a day.
[01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:05.360]  I mean, oh, how dare him?
[01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:08.360]  How dare someone in the press corps ask a mild question
[01:47:08.360 --> 01:47:10.360]  about human rights? This is terrible.
[01:47:10.360 --> 01:47:13.360]  I mean, it's a total capitulation to tyranny
[01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:16.360]  and authoritarianism, and I know you read a lot.
[01:47:16.360 --> 01:47:19.360]  I see it all over the media, cheerleading on the left and right
[01:47:19.360 --> 01:47:22.360]  for authoritarianism, reminiscent of the 30s
[01:47:22.360 --> 01:47:26.360]  when anything authoritative was like sexy.
[01:47:26.360 --> 01:47:28.360]  Well, people, you know, don't know
[01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:31.360]  because we don't teach history in the American schools anymore.
[01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:35.360]  But when in the 30s, when fascism and Nazism were starting
[01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:38.360]  in Italy and in Europe,
[01:47:38.360 --> 01:47:42.360]  the U.S. was enthusiastic about both.
[01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:44.360]  Hitler was on the cover of Time magazine
[01:47:44.360 --> 01:47:46.360]  in the span of the year.
[01:47:46.360 --> 01:47:48.360]  And this is the kind of thing that you had
[01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:50.360]  that people don't remember.
[01:47:50.360 --> 01:47:53.360]  I've documented, others have documented it.
[01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:56.360]  You've got, you know, the Wall Street crowd,
[01:47:56.360 --> 01:47:58.360]  including Prescott Bush,
[01:47:58.360 --> 01:48:00.360]  helping to fund the Nazis,
[01:48:00.360 --> 01:48:03.360]  the Dulles family, Averill Harriman,
[01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:05.360]  this whole group running Union Bank,
[01:48:05.360 --> 01:48:08.360]  which Franklin Roosevelt closed down
[01:48:08.360 --> 01:48:11.360]  because it was a Nazi bank being run in the United States.
[01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:13.360]  We want to erase all this part of our history,
[01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:15.360]  and we're doing it again.
[01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:17.360]  We're having both the left and the right
[01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:19.360]  falling in love with China.
[01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:21.360]  When I've warned again and again and again,
[01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:24.360]  America oversells to keep the,
[01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:26.360]  the China exploits labor.
[01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:28.360]  The whole proposition is that they have slave labor.
[01:48:28.360 --> 01:48:30.360]  They're going to continue slave labor.
[01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:32.360]  It's immoral. It's bad business.
[01:48:32.360 --> 01:48:34.360]  And China's moving to the point
[01:48:34.360 --> 01:48:36.360]  where they're going to demand affect.
[01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:38.360]  And they're now doing that.
[01:48:38.360 --> 01:48:40.360]  Now, shifting gears, we're almost out of time.
[01:48:40.360 --> 01:48:42.360]  Let's get into the big news here,
[01:48:42.360 --> 01:48:44.360]  which is Rome Corsi, who writes for WorldNet Daily,
[01:48:44.360 --> 01:48:46.360]  also writes with Red Alert.
[01:48:46.360 --> 01:48:48.360]  They're at WorldNet Daily.
[01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:50.360]  We're linked to it all at infowars.com.
[01:48:50.360 --> 01:48:52.360]  Let's, because we're about to go to break,
[01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:54.360]  I want to start talking about,
[01:48:54.360 --> 01:48:56.360]  Hawaiian governor can't find Obama's birth certificate,
[01:48:56.360 --> 01:48:58.360]  suggests controversy could hurt
[01:48:58.360 --> 01:49:00.360]  President's reelection chances.
[01:49:00.360 --> 01:49:02.360]  The mail looked into it and they concur.
[01:49:02.360 --> 01:49:04.360]  Hawaiian governor claims record of Obama's births
[01:49:04.360 --> 01:49:06.360]  exist in archives, but can't produce
[01:49:06.360 --> 01:49:08.360]  the vital document.
[01:49:08.360 --> 01:49:10.360]  I mean, for years they said,
[01:49:10.360 --> 01:49:12.360]  that is his birth certificate, that fake receipt.
[01:49:12.360 --> 01:49:14.360]  Now, Chris Matthews a month ago said,
[01:49:14.360 --> 01:49:16.360]  yeah, just show it. Where's the original
[01:49:16.360 --> 01:49:18.360]  with the signature?
[01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:20.360]  I mean, this is really starting to look suspicious.
[01:49:20.360 --> 01:49:22.360]  Dr. Corsi, start getting into it.
[01:49:22.360 --> 01:49:24.360]  Well, the key document that should be produced,
[01:49:24.360 --> 01:49:26.360]  if it exists, I don't believe it does,
[01:49:26.360 --> 01:49:28.360]  is the long form hospital-generated
[01:49:28.360 --> 01:49:30.360]  Hawaiian birth certificate
[01:49:30.360 --> 01:49:32.360]  for Barack Obama.
[01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:34.360]  Now, if he was born
[01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:36.360]  in Kapi'olani Hospital like he claims
[01:49:36.360 --> 01:49:38.360]  in Hawaii in 1961,
[01:49:38.360 --> 01:49:40.360]  fine, I'm happy to believe that.
[01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:42.360]  Why can't I see the document?
[01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:44.360]  Why can't we see this long form
[01:49:44.360 --> 01:49:46.360]  hospital-generated birth certificate?
[01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:48.360]  And the problem is,
[01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:50.360]  Governor Abakram becomes on in
[01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:52.360]  and promises he's going to investigate this.
[01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:54.360]  A friend of Barack Obama,
[01:49:54.360 --> 01:49:56.360]  a 60's hippie liberal
[01:49:56.360 --> 01:49:58.360]  anti-war guy, Barack Obama's friend,
[01:49:58.360 --> 01:50:00.360]  Abakrami only
[01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:02.360]  can find a log
[01:50:02.360 --> 01:50:04.360]  registry notice that Barack Obama
[01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:06.360]  was born.
[01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:08.360]  And the problem, Alex, is
[01:50:08.360 --> 01:50:10.360]  you could today, in 1961,
[01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:12.360]  the grandparents could go in
[01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:14.360]  to the Hawaii Department of Health
[01:50:14.360 --> 01:50:16.360]  and say, I want to register this baby
[01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:18.360]  as Hawaiian-born
[01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:20.360]  and Hawaii would do it.
[01:50:20.360 --> 01:50:22.360]  They'd put out the newspaper announcements.
[01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:24.360]  They would register it in a log book
[01:50:24.360 --> 01:50:26.360]  even if the baby was born
[01:50:26.360 --> 01:50:28.360]  in a foreign country.
[01:50:28.360 --> 01:50:30.360]  Hawaii has been doing this for years.
[01:50:30.360 --> 01:50:32.360]  Hawaii gave
[01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:34.360]  Sun Yat-sen, the Chinese
[01:50:34.360 --> 01:50:36.360]  internationalist in the 20's,
[01:50:36.360 --> 01:50:38.360]  they gave him a birth certificate
[01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:40.360]  because affidavits were produced
[01:50:40.360 --> 01:50:42.360]  saying Sun Yat-sen was born
[01:50:42.360 --> 01:50:44.360]  in Hawaii. He was all nonsense.
[01:50:44.360 --> 01:50:46.360]  Hawaii's been like this forever.
[01:50:46.360 --> 01:50:48.360]  Dr. Corsi, stay there,
[01:50:48.360 --> 01:50:50.360]  because that's the key.
[01:50:50.360 --> 01:50:52.360]  One thing they say is,
[01:50:52.360 --> 01:50:54.360]  why would parents and grandparents
[01:50:54.360 --> 01:50:56.360]  forge that he's a citizen?
[01:50:56.360 --> 01:50:58.360]  That's incredibly valuable.
[01:50:58.360 --> 01:51:00.360]  If he's born out of the country,
[01:51:00.360 --> 01:51:02.360]  of course they're going to try to forge that
[01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:04.360]  but the most potent ways to lower blood pressure
[01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:06.360]  is to inhibit the angiotensin converting enzyme
[01:51:06.360 --> 01:51:08.360]  in the body, also called ACE.
[01:51:08.360 --> 01:51:10.360]  In nature, there are a group of proteins
[01:51:10.360 --> 01:51:12.360]  found in unheated way that inhibit the ACE enzyme.
[01:51:12.360 --> 01:51:14.360]  The most potent ACE inhibitor
[01:51:14.360 --> 01:51:16.360]  to date is lactokinin.
[01:51:16.360 --> 01:51:18.360]  While lactokinin does not have the inhibitory potency
[01:51:18.360 --> 01:51:20.360]  of synthetic drugs,
[01:51:20.360 --> 01:51:22.360]  commonly used in the treatment of hypertension,
[01:51:22.360 --> 01:51:24.360]  this naturally occurring
[01:51:24.360 --> 01:51:26.360]  whey peptide may be able to help
[01:51:26.360 --> 01:51:28.360]  keep blood pressure normal.
[01:51:28.360 --> 01:51:30.360]  The most powerful whey protein supplement
[01:51:30.360 --> 01:51:32.360]  is One World Whey.
[01:51:32.360 --> 01:51:34.360]  One World Whey is the first ever
[01:51:34.360 --> 01:51:36.360]  unheated whey protein powder
[01:51:36.360 --> 01:51:38.360]  from grass-fed cows.
[01:51:38.360 --> 01:51:40.360]  One World Whey is easily digested
[01:51:40.360 --> 01:51:42.360]  and tastes delicious.
[01:51:42.360 --> 01:51:44.360]  Use One World Whey to support your exercise
[01:51:44.360 --> 01:51:46.360]  or weight loss goals,
[01:51:46.360 --> 01:51:48.360]  your optimal blood pressure, energy, endurance
[01:51:48.360 --> 01:51:50.360]  and mood.

[01:52:32.360 --> 01:52:34.360]  These seeds have not been genetically modified
[01:52:34.360 --> 01:52:36.360]  in any way and you actually get enough seeds
[01:52:36.360 --> 01:52:38.360]  to plant a full-acre crisis garden.

[01:52:48.360 --> 01:52:52.360]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:52:52.360 --> 01:52:54.360]  Remember, in a real crisis,
[01:52:54.360 --> 01:52:56.360]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:56.360 --> 01:52:58.360]  This is Alex Jones for
[01:52:58.360 --> 01:53:00.360]  survivalseedbank.com
[01:53:28.360 --> 01:53:30.360]  And my sleep really did improve.
[01:53:58.360 --> 01:54:00.360]  For Heart and Body Extract
[01:54:28.360 --> 01:54:30.360]  This is discrimination.
[01:54:30.360 --> 01:54:32.360]  This is the big city Chicago mafia model
[01:54:32.360 --> 01:54:34.360]  where you got to be on the inside
[01:54:34.360 --> 01:54:36.360]  or you don't get jobs. So how bad is this
[01:54:36.360 --> 01:54:38.360]  starting to hurt Obama?
[01:54:38.360 --> 01:54:40.360]  I know he's gotten a disgusting 15-point bounce
[01:54:40.360 --> 01:54:42.360]  out of the tragedy
[01:54:42.360 --> 01:54:44.360]  in Arizona.
[01:54:44.360 --> 01:54:46.360]  But please continue
[01:54:46.360 --> 01:54:48.360]  with the latest on the birth certificate.
[01:54:48.360 --> 01:54:50.360]  Well, the balance of the public relations
[01:54:50.360 --> 01:54:52.360]  of Obama, I think, is public relations
[01:54:52.360 --> 01:54:54.360]  to fluff. I don't expect it's going to last.
[01:54:54.360 --> 01:54:56.360]  The economic problems remain
[01:54:56.360 --> 01:54:58.360]  and they're going to be the ultimate,
[01:54:58.360 --> 01:55:00.360]  I think, difficulty for Obama.
[01:55:00.360 --> 01:55:02.360]  The birth certificate is not going away
[01:55:02.360 --> 01:55:04.360]  as a question.
[01:55:04.360 --> 01:55:06.360]  Right now you've got
[01:55:06.360 --> 01:55:08.360]  Governor Abba Cromby, a friend of Obama,
[01:55:08.360 --> 01:55:10.360]  comes into office says,
[01:55:10.360 --> 01:55:12.360]  I'm going to produce the documentary evidence Obama
[01:55:12.360 --> 01:55:14.360]  was born in Hawaii.
[01:55:14.360 --> 01:55:16.360]  Cannot find, does not produce
[01:55:16.360 --> 01:55:18.360]  a long-form hospital-generated
[01:55:18.360 --> 01:55:20.360]  birth certificate.
[01:55:20.360 --> 01:55:22.360]  It says to the
[01:55:22.360 --> 01:55:24.360]  Hawaii, you know, Halloween daily,
[01:55:24.360 --> 01:55:26.360]  you know, all you can find
[01:55:26.360 --> 01:55:28.360]  is this notation written down
[01:55:28.360 --> 01:55:30.360]  in an archive that Barack Obama
[01:55:30.360 --> 01:55:32.360]  was born. And the problem is
[01:55:32.360 --> 01:55:34.360]  I think the grandparents
[01:55:34.360 --> 01:55:36.360]  came in and registered this birth,
[01:55:36.360 --> 01:55:38.360]  which you could do in Hawaii, even if the baby
[01:55:38.360 --> 01:55:40.360]  was born somewhere else.
[01:55:40.360 --> 01:55:42.360]  And because the advertisement
[01:55:42.360 --> 01:55:44.360]  in the newspapers at the time of the birth
[01:55:44.360 --> 01:55:46.360]  announcement were the grandparents'
[01:55:46.360 --> 01:55:48.360]  address.
[01:55:48.360 --> 01:55:50.360]  The husband and wife never lived at that address.
[01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:52.360]  In fact, three weeks after the baby
[01:55:52.360 --> 01:55:54.360]  was born, Ann Dunham
[01:55:54.360 --> 01:55:56.360]  and Barack Obama's junior, little baby,
[01:55:56.360 --> 01:55:58.360]  were in Seattle.
[01:55:58.360 --> 01:56:00.360]  She was attending
[01:56:00.360 --> 01:56:02.360]  the University of Washington
[01:56:02.360 --> 01:56:04.360]  in extension courses.
[01:56:04.360 --> 01:56:06.360]  Ann Dunham stayed there for two years
[01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:08.360]  until Barack Obama, Sr., the father
[01:56:08.360 --> 01:56:10.360]  left the island to go to Harvard.
[01:56:10.360 --> 01:56:12.360]  Balmy and Daddy never lived together
[01:56:12.360 --> 01:56:14.360]  as man and wife.
[01:56:14.360 --> 01:56:16.360]  There's no indication that they did. I think the birth
[01:56:16.360 --> 01:56:18.360]  announcement was filed by the grandparents,
[01:56:18.360 --> 01:56:20.360]  wanting to make sure that Barack Obama
[01:56:20.360 --> 01:56:22.360]  got to be a U.S. citizen.
[01:56:22.360 --> 01:56:24.360]  Not because he was going to run
[01:56:24.360 --> 01:56:26.360]  for president. That's a silly idea.
[01:56:26.360 --> 01:56:28.360]  But because there's intrinsic advantages
[01:56:28.360 --> 01:56:30.360]  to being a U.S. citizen.
[01:56:30.360 --> 01:56:32.360]  Like you get
[01:56:32.360 --> 01:56:34.360]  to go to college as a U.S. citizen
[01:56:34.360 --> 01:56:36.360]  in U.S. schools on a preferential basis.
[01:56:36.360 --> 01:56:38.360]  You get a passport
[01:56:38.360 --> 01:56:40.360]  and you get social security.
[01:56:40.360 --> 01:56:42.360]  You get all kinds of benefits as a U.S. citizen.
[01:56:42.360 --> 01:56:44.360]  Like in the ancient world, everybody
[01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:46.360]  wanted to be a Roman citizen.
[01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:48.360]  One day in 1961
[01:56:48.360 --> 01:56:50.360]  everybody wanted to be a U.S. citizen.
[01:56:50.360 --> 01:56:52.360]  Barack Obama's grandparents,
[01:56:52.360 --> 01:56:54.360]  I believe, registered his birth
[01:56:54.360 --> 01:56:56.360]  in Hawaii even though there's
[01:56:56.360 --> 01:56:58.360]  no documentary evidence. Like a long form
[01:56:58.360 --> 01:57:00.360]  hospital generated birth certificate.
[01:57:00.360 --> 01:57:02.360]  Let's see it.
[01:57:02.360 --> 01:57:04.360]  That demonstrates that Barack Obama
[01:57:04.360 --> 01:57:06.360]  was born in an Hawaii house. What do you make of
[01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:08.360]  Matthews? Well, obviously the mother, too,
[01:57:08.360 --> 01:57:10.360]  is going to call him and say, hey, I want my boy to be
[01:57:10.360 --> 01:57:12.360]  an American. I don't want to be able to even
[01:57:12.360 --> 01:57:14.360]  get him in the country. Of course.
[01:57:14.360 --> 01:57:16.360]  What does it mean now that
[01:57:16.360 --> 01:57:18.360]  Matthews is going just release it?
[01:57:18.360 --> 01:57:20.360]  I mean, they've gone from stonewalling
[01:57:20.360 --> 01:57:22.360]  and claiming they've released a birth certificate
[01:57:22.360 --> 01:57:24.360]  to saying release it. And this governor
[01:57:24.360 --> 01:57:26.360]  stuck his foot in his mouth before he was
[01:57:26.360 --> 01:57:28.360]  actually in office when he was governor-elect
[01:57:28.360 --> 01:57:30.360]  and now he's saying, oops, I can't find it.
[01:57:30.360 --> 01:57:32.360]  Well, I think was right in saying
[01:57:32.360 --> 01:57:34.360]  that this is going to become a major
[01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:36.360]  re-election problem for President Obama.
[01:57:36.360 --> 01:57:38.360]  If it turns out that he's lied,
[01:57:38.360 --> 01:57:40.360]  Obama has lied, like I pointed out in
[01:57:40.360 --> 01:57:42.360]  Obamination, there's repeated lies
[01:57:42.360 --> 01:57:44.360]  in Obama's nativity story
[01:57:44.360 --> 01:57:46.360]  and his story of his life.
[01:57:46.360 --> 01:57:48.360]  We don't have his passport record.
[01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:50.360]  We don't have his travel record.
[01:57:50.360 --> 01:57:52.360]  The records I've got in Indonesia,
[01:57:52.360 --> 01:57:54.360]  he was registered at school as
[01:57:54.360 --> 01:57:56.360]  a Muslim and an Indonesian citizen.
[01:57:56.360 --> 01:57:58.360]  The mother, when they were in Indonesia,
[01:57:58.360 --> 01:58:00.360]  changed her passport, dropped
[01:58:00.360 --> 01:58:02.360]  Barack Obama, suggested he was
[01:58:02.360 --> 01:58:04.360]  an Indonesian citizen. But they
[01:58:04.360 --> 01:58:06.360]  now talk to the school. All the stuff
[01:58:06.360 --> 01:58:08.360]  you put out two, three years ago, it's all
[01:58:08.360 --> 01:58:10.360]  been all over mainstream foreign news now.
[01:58:10.360 --> 01:58:12.360]  Right, exactly. And Barack Obama
[01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:14.360]  is undocumented. We don't have his
[01:58:14.360 --> 01:58:16.360]  medical records. We don't have his school records.
[01:58:16.360 --> 01:58:18.360]  We don't have his ball office records.
[01:58:18.360 --> 01:58:20.360]  We don't have anything of Barack Obama.
[01:58:20.360 --> 01:58:22.360]  And if we can't get the passport
[01:58:22.360 --> 01:58:24.360]  record and the long form
[01:58:24.360 --> 01:58:26.360]  Hawaii hospital generated
[01:58:26.360 --> 01:58:28.360]  birth certificate,
[01:58:28.360 --> 01:58:30.360]  I was there in Hawaii.
[01:58:30.360 --> 01:58:32.360]  The hospitals don't have record
[01:58:32.360 --> 01:58:34.360]  of Barack Obama being born there.
[01:58:34.360 --> 01:58:36.360]  I hired private investigators.
[01:58:36.360 --> 01:58:38.360]  The records aren't there.
[01:58:38.360 --> 01:58:40.360]  Back in one minute, tell us about that
[01:58:40.360 --> 01:58:42.360]  history.
[01:58:42.360 --> 01:58:44.360]  America's number one source
[01:58:44.360 --> 01:58:46.360]  for independent talk radio
[01:58:46.360 --> 01:58:48.360]  for over a decade.
[01:58:48.360 --> 01:58:50.360]  We are the GCN
[01:58:50.360 --> 01:58:52.360]  radio network.
[01:58:52.360 --> 01:58:54.360]  Hundreds of nations
[01:58:54.360 --> 01:58:56.360]  have fallen to tyranny in the last
[01:58:56.360 --> 01:58:58.360]  century alone. This is our last chance
[01:58:58.360 --> 01:59:00.360]  to not relive history.
[01:59:00.360 --> 01:59:02.360]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:59:02.360 --> 01:59:04.360]  we're pulling the rug from underneath
[01:59:04.360 --> 01:59:06.360]  the Americans at home.
[01:59:06.360 --> 01:59:08.360]  I have tremendous influence on our
[01:59:08.360 --> 01:59:10.360]  Congress and they really
[01:59:10.360 --> 01:59:12.360]  are calling the shots. I think it's
[01:59:12.360 --> 01:59:14.360]  incumbent upon all of us
[01:59:14.360 --> 01:59:16.360]  as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:59:16.360 --> 01:59:18.360]  For the Republic identifies
[01:59:18.360 --> 01:59:20.360]  the enemies of our nation.
[01:59:20.360 --> 01:59:22.360]  The criminal off-short cartel
[01:59:22.360 --> 01:59:24.360]  held bent on destroying sovereignty
[01:59:24.360 --> 01:59:26.360]  and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:59:26.360 --> 01:59:28.360]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke and Arsonists
[01:59:28.360 --> 01:59:30.360]  they're asking for more matches
[01:59:30.360 --> 01:59:32.360]  and the Congress is saying who do we make
[01:59:32.360 --> 01:59:34.360]  the check out to? Today seems like nobody
[01:59:34.360 --> 01:59:36.360]  does care. And right now in Washington
[01:59:36.360 --> 01:59:38.360]  DC we have seen
[01:59:38.360 --> 01:59:40.360]  a fall of the Republic.

[02:00:20.360 --> 02:00:22.360]  Alex Jones
[02:00:22.360 --> 02:00:24.360]  Coming up in the next segment
[02:00:24.360 --> 02:00:26.360]  I'm getting into the economy
[02:00:26.360 --> 02:00:28.360]  the situation with China
[02:00:28.360 --> 02:00:30.360]  and a lot more. We've got five minutes left
[02:00:30.360 --> 02:00:32.360]  with Dr. Jerome Corsi. You know what he really
[02:00:32.360 --> 02:00:34.360]  is an expert on is the economy.
[02:00:34.360 --> 02:00:36.360]  Many years ago he predicted what's happening
[02:00:36.360 --> 02:00:38.360]  with derivatives. I remember five, six years ago
[02:00:38.360 --> 02:00:40.360]  reading his writings on it. Let's get him back soon
[02:00:40.360 --> 02:00:42.360]  it's been a while to talk about that
[02:00:42.360 --> 02:00:44.360]  but finishing up with the birth certificate
[02:00:44.360 --> 02:00:46.360]  major issue coming up in the election
[02:00:46.360 --> 02:00:48.360]  briefly the Mexican trucks
[02:00:48.360 --> 02:00:50.360]  what that means
[02:00:50.360 --> 02:00:52.360]  Well Alex the first wall
[02:00:52.360 --> 02:00:54.360]  I think the birth certificate issue is only going to
[02:00:54.360 --> 02:00:56.360]  increase
[02:00:56.360 --> 02:00:58.360]  presidents whose stone wall do not
[02:00:58.360 --> 02:01:00.360]  end up very well
[02:01:00.360 --> 02:01:02.360]  a clear example
[02:01:02.360 --> 02:01:04.360]  on that's Richard Nixon. And I think
[02:01:04.360 --> 02:01:06.360]  at least one state maybe more
[02:01:06.360 --> 02:01:08.360]  is going to pass a law
[02:01:08.360 --> 02:01:10.360]  for the 2012 presidential election
[02:01:10.360 --> 02:01:12.360]  the candidates are going to have to show to that
[02:01:12.360 --> 02:01:14.360]  Secretary of State in that state
[02:01:14.360 --> 02:01:16.360]  birth credential
[02:01:16.360 --> 02:01:18.360]  to qualify under the Constitution
[02:01:18.360 --> 02:01:20.360]  otherwise the candidate's not going to get on the ballot
[02:01:20.360 --> 02:01:22.360]  in that state as the presidential candidate
[02:01:22.360 --> 02:01:24.360]  one major state
[02:01:24.360 --> 02:01:26.360]  Texas
[02:01:26.360 --> 02:01:28.360]  passing that kind of a law. Barack Obama might just
[02:01:28.360 --> 02:01:30.360]  have to drop out of the reelection campaign
[02:01:32.360 --> 02:01:34.360]  Well there's already we've seen a Washington Post
[02:01:34.360 --> 02:01:36.360]  a few months ago and others telling him
[02:01:36.360 --> 02:01:38.360]  to drop out already. Well in fact
[02:01:38.360 --> 02:01:40.360]  I think the intensity of
[02:01:40.360 --> 02:01:42.360]  demonizing anybody like me
[02:01:42.360 --> 02:01:44.360]  who's saying where's the birth certificate
[02:01:44.360 --> 02:01:46.360]  shows that the left
[02:01:46.360 --> 02:01:48.360]  is really afraid of this issue
[02:01:48.360 --> 02:01:50.360]  and if the issue could be answered
[02:01:50.360 --> 02:01:52.360]  if Barack Obama had been born in a Hawaii hospital
[02:01:52.360 --> 02:01:54.360]  like he says he has
[02:01:54.360 --> 02:01:56.360]  I think we've already seen all the documentation
[02:01:56.360 --> 02:01:58.360]  I hired private investigators
[02:01:58.360 --> 02:02:00.360]  in 2008 when I wrote the
[02:02:00.360 --> 02:02:02.360]  Abomination I went to Hawaii
[02:02:02.360 --> 02:02:04.360]  I can tell you there are no records
[02:02:04.360 --> 02:02:06.360]  of the Hawaii hospital that Barack Obama was born there
[02:02:08.360 --> 02:02:10.360]  Incredible. I mean you know
[02:02:10.360 --> 02:02:12.360]  this was brought up during the campaign. Right
[02:02:12.360 --> 02:02:14.360]  and the Barack Obama people all be
[02:02:14.360 --> 02:02:16.360]  ever lied. They said two different hospitals
[02:02:16.360 --> 02:02:18.360]  was where he was born
[02:02:18.360 --> 02:02:20.360]  the first version was Queens Medical Center
[02:02:20.360 --> 02:02:22.360]  now it's Kapilani Medical Center
[02:02:22.360 --> 02:02:24.360]  and neither hospital has
[02:02:24.360 --> 02:02:26.360]  any record that Barack Obama was born
[02:02:26.360 --> 02:02:28.360]  there. Well they would have an admission
[02:02:28.360 --> 02:02:30.360]  record at least.
[02:02:30.360 --> 02:02:32.360]  The mother would have been there that had been a record of a birth
[02:02:32.360 --> 02:02:34.360]  and there would have been a hospital
[02:02:34.360 --> 02:02:36.360]  generated long form birth certificate.
[02:02:36.360 --> 02:02:38.360]  Did the establishment know this and put him in there
[02:02:38.360 --> 02:02:40.360]  for the blackmail
[02:02:40.360 --> 02:02:42.360]  angle? Possibly but I think
[02:02:42.360 --> 02:02:44.360]  the enthusiasm here
[02:02:44.360 --> 02:02:46.360]  over Barack Obama far left
[02:02:46.360 --> 02:02:48.360]  mainstream media got behind it
[02:02:48.360 --> 02:02:50.360]  all the issues
[02:02:50.360 --> 02:02:52.360]  of this leftist president
[02:02:52.360 --> 02:02:54.360]  the mainstream media fell
[02:02:54.360 --> 02:02:56.360]  in love with them and there was no investigative
[02:02:56.360 --> 02:02:58.360]  reporting down on Barack Obama
[02:02:58.360 --> 02:03:00.360]  if it had been George W. Bush
[02:03:00.360 --> 02:03:02.360]  they were
[02:03:02.360 --> 02:03:04.360]  researching George W. Bush for eight years
[02:03:04.360 --> 02:03:06.360]  on the air
[02:03:06.360 --> 02:03:08.360]  National Guard
[02:03:08.360 --> 02:03:10.360]  Barack Obama got a pass on everything
[02:03:10.360 --> 02:03:12.360]  Alright we're almost out of time and you've got to go
[02:03:12.360 --> 02:03:14.360]  don't you?
[02:03:14.360 --> 02:03:16.360]  I guess I got another show coming right up but I'll come back
[02:03:16.360 --> 02:03:18.360]  Yeah because we got about two minutes left
[02:03:18.360 --> 02:03:20.360]  then I was going to get into the economy but let's get into the Mexican
[02:03:20.360 --> 02:03:22.360]  trucks
[02:03:22.360 --> 02:03:24.360]  got a minute and a half on that. Well the Mexican
[02:03:24.360 --> 02:03:26.360]  Barack Obama is going to have a plan. I've got copies
[02:03:26.360 --> 02:03:28.360]  of the concept document
[02:03:28.360 --> 02:03:30.360]  I've been talking to the Department of Transportation
[02:03:30.360 --> 02:03:32.360]  Mexican trucks are going to be
[02:03:32.360 --> 02:03:34.360]  rolling in the United States all through the
[02:03:34.360 --> 02:03:36.360]  United States a new pilot program
[02:03:36.360 --> 02:03:38.360]  by mid-year
[02:03:38.360 --> 02:03:40.360]  and remember in 2009
[02:03:40.360 --> 02:03:42.360]  Barack Obama signed the omnibus funding bill
[02:03:42.360 --> 02:03:44.360]  Congress had taken away the money
[02:03:44.360 --> 02:03:46.360]  from the Bush administration
[02:03:46.360 --> 02:03:48.360]  Mexican truck
[02:03:48.360 --> 02:03:50.360]  pilot because of course the trucks
[02:03:50.360 --> 02:03:52.360]  don't meet U.S. standards
[02:03:52.360 --> 02:03:54.360]  the drivers don't meet U.S. standards
[02:03:54.360 --> 02:03:56.360]  they're safety issues
[02:03:56.360 --> 02:03:58.360]  they don't let our trucks down there
[02:03:58.360 --> 02:04:00.360]  and our trucks
[02:04:00.360 --> 02:04:02.360]  but first of all most American truckers
[02:04:02.360 --> 02:04:04.360]  they want to go to Mexico
[02:04:04.360 --> 02:04:06.360]  they probably wouldn't end up with a ring
[02:04:06.360 --> 02:04:08.360]  stolen themselves by the side of the road
[02:04:08.360 --> 02:04:10.360]  dead
[02:04:10.360 --> 02:04:12.360]  the point is
[02:04:12.360 --> 02:04:14.360]  Obama is just as much of a globalist
[02:04:14.360 --> 02:04:16.360]  if not more than George Bush
[02:04:16.360 --> 02:04:18.360]  Obama campaigned on that he was going to
[02:04:18.360 --> 02:04:20.360]  renegotiate napton save U.S. jobs
[02:04:20.360 --> 02:04:22.360]  he's doing the opposite
[02:04:22.360 --> 02:04:24.360]  he's going to open the border
[02:04:24.360 --> 02:04:26.360]  we're going to have Mexican trucks back in the United States
[02:04:26.360 --> 02:04:28.360]  so we got to put pressure on Congress to block that
[02:04:28.360 --> 02:04:30.360]  key part of the SPP
[02:04:30.360 --> 02:04:32.360]  we now got the trusted traveler program
[02:04:32.360 --> 02:04:34.360]  in place on November 30
[02:04:34.360 --> 02:04:36.360]  again in the polytons
[02:04:36.360 --> 02:04:38.360]  signed the program with Mexican-Mexican style
[02:04:38.360 --> 02:04:40.360]  80 some million of them estimated
[02:04:40.360 --> 02:04:42.360]  can become trusted travelers in North America
[02:04:42.360 --> 02:04:44.360]  they get a card
[02:04:44.360 --> 02:04:46.360]  with a map of the continental
[02:04:46.360 --> 02:04:48.360]  continental North America
[02:04:48.360 --> 02:04:50.360]  on it no borders
[02:04:50.360 --> 02:04:52.360]  they swipe it through a global entry
[02:04:52.360 --> 02:04:54.360]  terminal and they come into the United States
[02:04:54.360 --> 02:04:56.360]  go to globalentry.gov
[02:04:56.360 --> 02:04:58.360]  yeah that's the SPP right there
[02:04:58.360 --> 02:05:00.360]  Dr. Corsi thank you so much
[02:05:00.360 --> 02:05:02.360]  appreciate you joining us
[02:05:02.360 --> 02:05:04.360]  hi folks this is Alex Jones
[02:05:04.360 --> 02:05:06.360]  and I want to tell you about the silver lungs generator
[02:05:06.360 --> 02:05:08.360]  now you can produce pure
[02:05:08.360 --> 02:05:10.360]  and endless colloidal silver
[02:05:10.360 --> 02:05:12.360]  and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream
[02:05:12.360 --> 02:05:14.360]  by breathing the solution
[02:05:14.360 --> 02:05:16.360]  through the lungs
[02:05:16.360 --> 02:05:18.360]  the respiratory system is the first line of defense
[02:05:18.360 --> 02:05:20.360]  for airborne pathogens and viruses
[02:05:20.360 --> 02:05:22.360]  the silver lungs generator
[02:05:22.360 --> 02:05:24.360]  infuses the respiratory system
[02:05:24.360 --> 02:05:26.360]  with your self-produced nano-silver solutions
[02:05:26.360 --> 02:05:28.360]  and also delivers
[02:05:28.360 --> 02:05:30.360]  the silver nanoparticles
[02:05:30.360 --> 02:05:32.360]  instantly into the bloodstream
[02:05:32.360 --> 02:05:34.360]  with continued legislation threatening the sale
[02:05:34.360 --> 02:05:36.360]  of nano-silver products
[02:05:36.360 --> 02:05:38.360]  you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[02:05:38.360 --> 02:05:40.360]  with the silver lungs generator
[02:05:40.360 --> 02:05:42.360]  very easy to follow
[02:05:42.360 --> 02:05:44.360]  step-by-step instructions are provided
[02:05:44.360 --> 02:05:46.360]  making production fast and simple

[02:08:24.360 --> 02:08:30.120]  earlier it was just on Charlie Rose last night about big use crisis has been perfect what we're
[02:08:30.120 --> 02:08:36.840]  doing now is the world is accepting the new world order I've got a ton a ton of news I want to cover
[02:08:37.640 --> 02:08:43.560]  including Obama may call for gun control during state of the union this is huge
[02:08:44.440 --> 02:08:50.760]  Steve Watson report with all the uh attributed links there to AFP NBC Obama may call for gun
[02:08:50.760 --> 02:08:56.200]  control during state of the union I had a plan today and it's always successful I do it in the
[02:08:56.200 --> 02:09:00.600]  first or second hour if I do it the third hour it's generally successful and I don't do it as much
[02:09:00.600 --> 02:09:06.360]  as I used to because it's such a powerful tool I want to use it sparingly but by doing Google bombs
[02:09:07.720 --> 02:09:12.200]  by making search terms number one it makes a lot of other news pay attention to it it makes a lot
[02:09:12.200 --> 02:09:17.080]  of people link to us it makes a lot of people go read our stories so they get the full spectrum of
[02:09:17.080 --> 02:09:22.040]  what's happening it's not just that China is a threat to our liberties and freedoms and driving
[02:09:22.040 --> 02:09:28.360]  on our wages it's that it teamed up with the globalist so I want to do a google search we did
[02:09:28.360 --> 02:09:32.520]  this a week ago and we made the number one number two and number three search all three of the searches
[02:09:32.520 --> 02:09:38.120]  we launched you did an incredible job together so before I get into some of this news and open the
[02:09:38.120 --> 02:09:45.800]  phones up and the toll-free number by the way is 800 25 at 992 31 they're announcing oh housing's
[02:09:45.800 --> 02:09:51.160]  worse than we thought oh interest rates are going up oh this was all planned they've been lying to
[02:09:51.160 --> 02:09:54.920]  everybody they knew this was going to happen they've done this over and over again I want to get your
[02:09:54.920 --> 02:10:04.920]  take on it 800 25 at 992 31 we'll get into Obama and the gun control there's another article here
[02:10:04.920 --> 02:10:11.960]  at presentplanet.com congressman senator or president Ron Paul in 2012 and Ron Paul says he's
[02:10:11.960 --> 02:10:18.040]  seriously considering a 2012 Senate run after he was voted Texas most popular choice to replace
[02:10:18.040 --> 02:10:24.040]  outgoing senator in a recent survey he'll be joining us Friday from Texas from down there in
[02:10:24.040 --> 02:10:29.240]  Lake Jackson so we look forward to that in the first hour on Friday I guess that's tomorrow
[02:10:29.800 --> 02:10:34.600]  and the more and more he's creeping towards it but but I think the presidential runs the way to go
[02:10:34.600 --> 02:10:42.440]  the Senate's a shoe in he'll win super pot me in Texas it's 84% approval rating Gallup I mean
[02:10:42.440 --> 02:10:52.120]  nobody gets that it's over 70 nationwide you know do you go for the one bird in the hand or the
[02:10:52.120 --> 02:10:59.400]  5,000 birds in the bush even if he loses what she probably would the educational opportunity the
[02:10:59.400 --> 02:11:03.560]  platform but I was going to get into a bunch of other issues with Ron Paul tomorrow but I'm
[02:11:03.560 --> 02:11:07.880]  obviously I'm going to be raising this so that's coming up huge article health authorities want
[02:11:07.880 --> 02:11:12.200]  depression causing drugs added to the water supply this is actually happening that's up on
[02:11:12.200 --> 02:11:19.000]  presentplanet.com and info wars.com I got to say my writers Aaron Dykes, Curtin, Mo, Jason Douglas,
[02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:25.160]  Paul Watson, Steve Watson they're all on fire with the incredible job they're doing the amount of
[02:11:25.160 --> 02:11:32.200]  piercing articles they're writing every day but I want to I'm going to take some calls for a while
[02:11:32.200 --> 02:11:36.280]  then I'll start getting into all that news because I haven't been taking a lot of calls lately but
[02:11:36.280 --> 02:11:41.400]  before I do that there were a couple news articles written yesterday that are so important that people
[02:11:41.400 --> 02:11:45.960]  need to see to get the full spectrum of what's happening China plants flag on Constitution
[02:11:45.960 --> 02:11:52.600]  Avenue Curtin, Mo and the other one by Paul Watson and Alex Jones meet the new boss China owns the
[02:11:52.600 --> 02:11:57.960]  United States but then you read deeper they're just the receivership arm of the banks they're a
[02:11:57.960 --> 02:12:03.400]  shell corporation so China wouldn't be this big threat if there weren't insiders in our country
[02:12:03.400 --> 02:12:08.680]  that had made treasonous traitorous deals with them and this is all on record in these two articles
[02:12:08.680 --> 02:12:12.600]  now I want these to be read and seen by folks and they have been read and seen by a lot but I want
[02:12:12.600 --> 02:12:20.360]  them to be seen by even more so let's make these articles the number one and number two search
[02:12:20.360 --> 02:12:23.960]  terms and you can choose which ones you think you should enter into Google over and over again to
[02:12:23.960 --> 02:12:28.360]  it 20 30 times you know type it in then put a cursor in it as if it's a new search and just
[02:12:28.360 --> 02:12:33.400]  hit enter again click on the articles email them out to folks there's more than one way to skin a
[02:12:33.400 --> 02:12:45.720]  cat and get the word out but let's do China new boss China new boss that'll lead them to meet the
[02:12:45.720 --> 02:12:54.760]  new boss China owns the United States let's do China new boss three words China new boss is one
[02:12:54.760 --> 02:12:59.800]  search term China new boss and the secondary search term if you're done entering that if
[02:12:59.800 --> 02:13:06.520]  you want to reach millions more people is China plants flag I think that'll be the number one
[02:13:06.520 --> 02:13:13.240]  search China plants flag you go to Google go to yahoo whatever you choose enter it over and over
[02:13:13.240 --> 02:13:17.960]  and over again you know why you're there at your coffee break or whatever it weren't and in just a
[02:13:17.960 --> 02:13:23.320]  few minutes I mean in fact guys give me a document cam shot for prisonplanet.tv viewers because I get
[02:13:23.320 --> 02:13:27.560]  emails about this some folks understand what I'm talking about or not even a document cam shot
[02:13:27.560 --> 02:13:32.280]  with the document cam show them my monitor across there please I'm going to show or you guys can
[02:13:32.280 --> 02:13:39.000]  do it live I guess on Google all you do is go to Google using this Pentagon tool against the
[02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:42.920]  globalist again I'm not even against the Pentagon but it's been created and controlled by the offshore
[02:13:42.920 --> 02:13:49.560]  banks and you go there and you simply type in and I know most of you know this but some people get
[02:13:49.560 --> 02:13:53.480]  confused by it because they sit there and try to retype in the whole line over and over again you
[02:13:53.480 --> 02:14:01.880]  don't have to do that and you just type in my article go there it is China plants flag so China
[02:14:01.880 --> 02:14:14.360]  China plants flag and you hit enter and then after you hit enter you see the top search
[02:14:14.360 --> 02:14:22.520]  info wars.com second search prisonplanet.com and then all you do is you click news this is one
[02:14:22.520 --> 02:14:29.080]  way to enter it over and over again you hit web you hit images you hit videos you hit shopping
[02:14:29.080 --> 02:14:35.800]  you hit gmail you hit more you go back because every time you're doing this it's researching it
[02:14:36.600 --> 02:14:42.360]  you understand that if you could just sit there and click links up here with that search term in
[02:14:42.360 --> 02:14:45.800]  there and do it over and over and over again without having some artificial engine that
[02:14:45.800 --> 02:14:50.840]  does this for you or you can go up and plant a cursor I'll show folks you plant a cursor in
[02:14:50.840 --> 02:14:55.800]  the middle of China plants or so I might want to spell that right I had looked at what I'd spelled
[02:14:55.800 --> 02:15:08.040]  it's hard to talk and walk and chew gum at the same time here okay and so once you have China
[02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:13.080]  plants flag you just put a cursor in it and then you hit return and then you go out and replace
[02:15:13.080 --> 02:15:19.880]  the cursor and you hit return and each time it re-enters it and that's the most effective way
[02:15:19.880 --> 02:15:28.280]  to do that is to you guys don't have a cursor on it so it's not going to search you use you
[02:15:28.280 --> 02:15:35.240]  plant a cursor and do it yeah there you go so so that's how you get the word out ladies and
[02:15:35.240 --> 02:15:40.680]  gentlemen and it's very very effective and so I hope people will search the term China plants flag
[02:15:42.520 --> 02:15:48.440]  and then the other one meet China new boss China new boss and China plants flag
[02:15:48.440 --> 02:15:54.600]  flag and we will certainly expose to people exactly what's going on with the globalist
[02:15:55.320 --> 02:16:00.760]  on that front let's take 20 minutes of calls or so that i'm getting into obama's frightening
[02:16:00.760 --> 02:16:07.320]  anti-gun agenda which he's emboldened by his 15 point bump watson had another article about
[02:16:07.320 --> 02:16:12.120]  that today remember all last year i kept saying all these white house advisors and pollsters
[02:16:12.120 --> 02:16:18.120]  kept saying obama needs a crisis a tragedy an oklahoma city a 9 11 something to poses our
[02:16:18.120 --> 02:16:26.280]  savior something to poses the protector the the the comforter and now he has a 15 point bump in
[02:16:26.280 --> 02:16:33.240]  gallup it'll be short lived it'll last a few weeks but but still imagine what a city being nuked would
[02:16:33.240 --> 02:16:37.880]  do and then they've got their whole police state set up and even cops who know what's going on with
[02:16:37.880 --> 02:16:43.400]  the new world order and military will still just i know alex i know it's bad but we're taking the guns
[02:16:43.400 --> 02:16:49.240]  al qaeda hit chicago and let me tell you something if they nuke chicago or dc or dallas or something
[02:16:49.800 --> 02:16:56.280]  even set a little one off they are going to come arrest me i mean they're going to try to arrest some
[02:16:56.280 --> 02:17:02.360]  big fish uh in the alternative media to scare everybody to shut up when they go for full
[02:17:02.360 --> 02:17:06.920]  bore marshal law oklahoma city and the 9 11 were just in the preparatory phase you can see now
[02:17:06.920 --> 02:17:11.320]  they're going on every front and if you give in to fear and don't put up the signs all over town
[02:17:11.320 --> 02:17:16.920]  the day they nuke a city the day they nerve gas a city the day they blow up 15 buildings you know
[02:17:16.920 --> 02:17:22.120]  they can do a grab bag of things the day they have 500 pipe bombs detonate simultaneously and they
[02:17:22.120 --> 02:17:28.520]  trot out some mentally retarded patsy on tv the day they do that you got to hit the streets at night
[02:17:28.520 --> 02:17:34.040]  with hundreds of flyers saying stage terror to take your rights you've got to call into all the talk
[02:17:34.040 --> 02:17:40.280]  radio that day you've got to call congress you've got to have a huge buzz that it was staged banner
[02:17:40.280 --> 02:17:45.720]  hangs on highways you name it they can't get all of you but if they're able to shut down the big
[02:17:45.720 --> 02:17:51.320]  alternative media when they pull when the offshore global a stage these big events that they're
[02:17:51.320 --> 02:17:57.960]  clearly gearing up for if you just kind of cower down and wait and see what happens they're going
[02:17:57.960 --> 02:18:04.440]  to win or at least win that big round of takeover and then we are into a actual full bore resistance
[02:18:04.440 --> 02:18:12.120]  but if you all charge out like we did with the shooting and expose it was a fraud and then they
[02:18:12.120 --> 02:18:19.480]  were capitalizing on it politically that blew up in their face it helped obama the democrats
[02:18:19.480 --> 02:18:24.200]  approval writing even went down more the republicans have gone way above obama because baner did
[02:18:24.200 --> 02:18:30.920]  something he said he would do wow how novel is that they repealed the healthcare law but only in
[02:18:30.920 --> 02:18:35.080]  the house oh because they knew they wouldn't have the votes in the senate i wonder if they had the
[02:18:35.080 --> 02:18:42.440]  votes in the senate of baner would have done that let's see what happens but i'm not trying to scare
[02:18:42.440 --> 02:18:48.120]  people not facing how much trouble we're in is what is going to allow the situation to really
[02:18:48.120 --> 02:18:53.480]  deteriorate into a full bore hot tyranny we're going from a cold tyranny that's been creeping and
[02:18:53.480 --> 02:18:59.320]  taking its time making preparations to a galloping tyranny now going into a full sprint
[02:18:59.320 --> 02:19:06.360]  and you can see the preparations just waxing intensifying on every front and i haven't sacrificed
[02:19:06.360 --> 02:19:13.080]  my name my family everything i am i haven't put everything on the table because i think we can't
[02:19:13.080 --> 02:19:19.960]  win i know historically i know in my gut i know in my spirit i know intellectually i know historically
[02:19:19.960 --> 02:19:26.040]  on every front i know we can and we must win this global crime syndicate is going to give us no

[02:19:30.600 --> 02:19:39.000]  been going on forever this is a hot vicious sickening tyranny and it's all or nothing
[02:19:39.880 --> 02:19:45.480]  it's the equivalent of linen trying to take power in 1917 it's the equivalent of hitler
[02:19:45.480 --> 02:19:51.800]  trying to take power in 1933 that's even worse than that it's like 1937 tyranny i mean we've got

[02:33:56.920 --> 02:34:01.800]  doubt that we are headed into serious bondage like almost every other nation in the world
[02:34:02.680 --> 02:34:08.040]  adverse filled very wicked people are taking over our society and and and i last night and about
[02:34:08.040 --> 02:34:13.960]  four a.m i woke up went back to sleep and again i'm not somebody that quote bible thumbs i'm not
[02:34:13.960 --> 02:34:18.840]  somebody who likes these big establishment christian churches and their new world order promotion
[02:34:18.840 --> 02:34:25.320]  their pro war promotion their globalist lies but i'm talking about my personal heart my personal
[02:34:25.320 --> 02:34:30.360]  soul and i don't claim to be a perfect great person i got a heavy load of flesh you know the
[02:34:30.360 --> 02:34:36.360]  world i'm tied into it i mean i know all about it but it's because i do have that knowledge that i
[02:34:36.360 --> 02:34:41.880]  could see how good god's plan is it will follow it america's never been perfect but we followed
[02:34:41.880 --> 02:34:47.640]  that plan more than anybody else and look at how we were blessed now all the blessings are leaving
[02:34:47.640 --> 02:34:52.840]  we are going into bondage and even if you're an atheist you become blinded by not realizing there's
[02:34:52.840 --> 02:34:59.960]  more out there in the world things cultures have all experienced uh so many scientists now studying
[02:34:59.960 --> 02:35:05.400]  the brain are becoming religious as they discover that societies and groups have never known each
[02:35:05.400 --> 02:35:09.800]  other are having the same experience i'm getting some scientists on the next few weeks to talk about
[02:35:09.800 --> 02:35:22.520]  that um and well the issue here is that if we can't repent and and by repent recognize that
[02:35:22.520 --> 02:35:28.680]  we let 51 million babies be aborted black people and the liberal death that they were sold have
[02:35:28.680 --> 02:35:34.600]  accepted 52 percent of blacks not being born since roe v wade where are their black leaders
[02:35:34.600 --> 02:35:39.080]  somebody calls them a name they run around and scream on tv but they don't get mad about
[02:35:39.080 --> 02:35:44.840]  more than half their people being killed we need to repent we need to repent conservatives out there
[02:35:44.840 --> 02:35:50.040]  who supported these wars based on lies and think that death is cool and torture is cool
[02:35:50.040 --> 02:35:55.800]  you are buying into evil and when you allow evil to be done to others it will come back on you
[02:35:55.800 --> 02:36:04.440]  in this life in this life you reap what you sow and it's just a fact of life a fact of the universe
[02:36:05.320 --> 02:36:09.960]  and you can see the storm we're already in and it's only getting stronger it's only getting
[02:36:09.960 --> 02:36:14.760]  more crazy and the lies as they tell us the economy is great when it's admitted on the other hand
[02:36:14.760 --> 02:36:20.360]  it's falling apart and the globalists who've engineered this offer more of the same poison
[02:36:20.360 --> 02:36:24.120]  as the cure but but just briefly because i need to get to other callers and it's
[02:36:24.120 --> 02:36:29.000]  always good to hear from me when you get in a few times a year bob in texas i got heber nine in
[02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:35.240]  front of me and and and uh i mean specifically if you want to read this passage or what area of
[02:36:35.240 --> 02:36:41.080]  heber is now you're talking about the whole thing you want folks to read okay uh era i mean i'm
[02:36:41.080 --> 02:36:47.320]  at least more simple than that these words are a word picture it's not going to help for me to
[02:36:47.320 --> 02:36:54.600]  read them as somebody to listen as the person reads uh he will see the picture and you notice
[02:36:54.600 --> 02:37:01.160]  in verse 16 17 it says you have a will and testament after the testator dies nobody's
[02:37:01.160 --> 02:37:10.200]  bothered to go over and find out what jesus did when he died in verse 13 14 15 16 and 17 he tells
[02:37:10.200 --> 02:37:17.160]  us what he did what he accomplished but it points after he dies so after he dies you find out just
[02:37:17.160 --> 02:37:23.560]  like will testament today after you die the will and testament's followed you don't call the probate
[02:37:23.560 --> 02:37:29.560]  court you don't get a lawyer or somebody you go and read that will and you find out about the
[02:37:29.560 --> 02:37:35.080]  estate you find out what the plan you talked about a plan while ago you talked about repentance
[02:37:35.080 --> 02:37:43.080]  it's unfolded 50 days later in acts two and then later it talks about this repentance
[02:37:43.080 --> 02:37:48.840]  there but he's ignoring it look at it and second him the 224 and 25 it's saying you've got a person
[02:37:48.840 --> 02:37:56.040]  be taught and the lord through teaching helps you to acknowledge the truth and he helps you in
[02:37:56.040 --> 02:38:01.800]  bringing about repentance you see that unfolded in acts two that's why i mentioned ebra's nine
[02:38:02.520 --> 02:38:11.080]  and acts two never mind somebody reading it to you read it it's a word picture and you've been very
[02:38:11.080 --> 02:38:20.360]  bold the last few days about saying that energy is the power of freedom you're gonna have to get
[02:38:20.360 --> 02:38:26.840]  the energy in order to have freedom to be free and i'm telling you we've got something greater than
[02:38:26.840 --> 02:38:35.080]  zero energy it's this eternal energy that's expressed by that great creator in his will and
[02:38:35.080 --> 02:38:42.280]  testament through his son who's the mediator and the testator and there ain't no qualified
[02:38:42.280 --> 02:38:50.200]  probate lawyers around well i mean to simplify it we need to admit that we are hurtling towards
[02:38:50.200 --> 02:38:57.560]  corruption that we do we are inherently fallen and by admitting that we can then reach for
[02:38:57.560 --> 02:39:02.280]  something greater and we need to ask god to leave god and direct us against this evil and to give us
[02:39:02.280 --> 02:39:07.240]  the courage and the focus and to realize that everybody has gifts and there are people out
[02:39:07.240 --> 02:39:12.200]  there who it is your destiny if you'll take it in your hands and follow god's program to stand up
[02:39:12.200 --> 02:39:16.680]  against evil and and and you know the world comes at you and says well you got to do it perfect or
[02:39:16.680 --> 02:39:21.800]  you got to have all the answers you got to have a simple overnight fix no it's simply setting your
[02:39:21.800 --> 02:39:27.080]  will against corruption and making the personal decision every day to try to be a better person
[02:39:27.080 --> 02:39:32.200]  and to try to stand up against evil and it is in the saying no to corruption your own life and
[02:39:32.200 --> 02:39:37.640]  everywhere else that you begin to see that change in the world and god bless you i appreciate you
[02:39:37.640 --> 02:39:42.760]  joining us and folks they say there are no atheists and foxholes look whatever you're going to do out
[02:39:42.760 --> 02:39:49.160]  there we're going in the wrong direction people better gear up and get focused and uh you know
[02:39:49.160 --> 02:39:54.120]  if you don't believe in god that's your issue tonight when you get home from work go in your
[02:39:54.120 --> 02:40:01.400]  bedroom close the door sit down in a chair and spend 30 minutes quietly thinking about the state of
[02:40:01.400 --> 02:40:05.240]  affairs in this world and thinking about the government and thinking about the media and
[02:40:05.240 --> 02:40:11.800]  thinking about society and and and think about the stream we're in the river we've gotten into
[02:40:11.800 --> 02:40:16.760]  and where it's leading us i mean look around you look at what how deep we've already gotten into
[02:40:16.760 --> 02:40:22.280]  this i mean we've got to get off this road we got to get off this path we have got and it starts by
[02:40:22.280 --> 02:40:26.600]  just getting out of the water and standing on the side and going to i want to keep going downstream
[02:40:26.600 --> 02:40:32.280]  is this the road the canal i want to be on because let me tell you the ocean it leads to we're getting
[02:40:32.280 --> 02:40:40.680]  very close to that ocean is an ocean of pain an ocean of humiliation an ocean of wickedness that
[02:40:40.680 --> 02:40:46.120]  enjoys attacking anything good it's that simple the globalist regardless of what you want to
[02:40:46.120 --> 02:40:51.240]  believe about the world you study the globalist they hate good things they hate strength they hate
[02:40:51.240 --> 02:40:55.880]  anything honorable they want to hurt you they want to dumb you down so they can dominate you
[02:40:56.840 --> 02:41:01.960]  they come to kill steal and destroy there's no doubt about that and they've got so many
[02:41:01.960 --> 02:41:07.000]  good men and women worldwide working for them through compartmentalization so that you don't
[02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:14.040]  see what you're a larger part of recognize it make a decision and this is such a big issue i don't
[02:41:14.040 --> 02:41:18.680]  even feel worthy to be here you know telling people to get their house in order i need to get my house
[02:41:18.680 --> 02:41:24.600]  in order i try every day and compared to most people i'm a very moral person very pious person
[02:41:24.600 --> 02:41:29.480]  compared to most people but i can still see who i am the thoughts i have the things i do the way
[02:41:29.480 --> 02:41:38.040]  i deceive myself we and and and all the co until pro the infighting the disinformation the divide
[02:41:38.040 --> 02:41:46.760]  and conquer the new world order forces you into their paradigm like i'm i'm all i'm the guy that
[02:41:46.760 --> 02:41:57.480]  said 12 14 years ago get out of the left right paradigm that's now a maxim a understood meme globally
[02:41:59.560 --> 02:42:03.640]  that's an example the power of the individual seeing an inherent truth that others weren't
[02:42:03.640 --> 02:42:07.720]  recognizing and speaking it how the system was dividing us how they were playing us off against
[02:42:07.720 --> 02:42:12.840]  each other carol quickly said use that against the population he didn't call it left right paradigm
[02:42:12.840 --> 02:42:21.960]  he said give them false choices but to respond to the left right paradigm where they come and
[02:42:21.960 --> 02:42:27.240]  say conservatives caused the shooting then you've got to come out and say no conservatives didn't
[02:42:27.240 --> 02:42:31.560]  this guy was a liberal and now you're debating within their control paradigm when the whole
[02:42:31.560 --> 02:42:36.200]  system is just to get us to fight with each other and then blame our rights that we all share
[02:42:36.200 --> 02:42:46.360]  as if they are the fount the progenitor the engine the the creator of the problems when
[02:42:46.360 --> 02:42:51.560]  they are the solution everything this mainstream media this global cult culture pushes
[02:42:53.800 --> 02:42:59.960]  is destructive it's it's designed to confuse you it's designed to to destroy common sense and
[02:42:59.960 --> 02:43:07.960]  most of the reporters they're not even consciously evil serving the lie they have been born into it
[02:43:07.960 --> 02:43:12.760]  that's what's so dangerous about a tyranny it takes a long time to grow a societal de-evolution a
[02:43:12.760 --> 02:43:18.840]  societal degeneration a societal wickedness and if that guy's shooting those people in wicked then
[02:43:18.840 --> 02:43:22.760]  then you know first they teach you there is no good and evil well well somebody kidnapped
[02:43:22.760 --> 02:43:27.000]  and a kid and tortured him to death that isn't inherently evil doesn't hurt your heart no you
[02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:31.640]  know good and evil it's real first learn to recognize that and once you can recognize that
[02:43:31.640 --> 02:43:38.040]  everything else follows but so many people can't so many people can't recognize good from evil
[02:43:38.040 --> 02:43:43.720]  and and and so many people that are in this global system and who are under deception they just
[02:43:43.720 --> 02:43:50.920]  believe the lies so they regurgitated giving it force of will force of power in this third dimension
[02:43:50.920 --> 02:43:58.120]  we all live in do you understand that that's so fundamental we're bound down by these chains
[02:43:59.160 --> 02:44:06.440]  of lies of twisting of language of the reduction of language it doesn't matter if you're black
[02:44:06.440 --> 02:44:11.480]  white old young where you live in the world what color you are what at the end of the day we are
[02:44:11.480 --> 02:44:17.320]  all being programmed by an artificial synthetic tyranny a scientific dictatorship that has studied
[02:44:17.320 --> 02:44:22.440]  how humans operate and knows how to manipulate us and only by studying the enemy's programming
[02:44:22.440 --> 02:44:29.400]  and how they operate can we triumph over it once you see their grid it's unbelievable that anyone
[02:44:29.400 --> 02:44:33.960]  would fall for it but then it's so complex when you're trying to communicate with people that
[02:44:33.960 --> 02:44:41.240]  have been so enslaved including myself that it's hard to even it's almost like when you start trying
[02:44:41.240 --> 02:44:45.720]  to talk to somebody at work or or your wife or your husband or whoever and you start talking
[02:44:45.720 --> 02:44:50.600]  and they take the first three words of what you've said and jump to a conclusion when you're talking
[02:44:50.600 --> 02:44:57.640]  about something completely different they and everyone does this I do it you jump to a conclusion
[02:44:57.640 --> 02:45:02.120]  when someone is saying something and then you start interrupting them going with a line of
[02:45:02.120 --> 02:45:06.840]  reasoning or debate that isn't even pertaining to what they're saying that's the same thing with
[02:45:06.840 --> 02:45:12.280]  semantics what did George Arwell write about 1984 how they'd reduce the language down how they
[02:45:12.280 --> 02:45:17.080]  changed the meaning of words how they'd written a new language where it was almost impossible to
[02:45:17.080 --> 02:45:22.520]  communicate with people he was a propaganda writer in reality and in that fictitious book
[02:45:22.520 --> 02:45:28.920]  so he was a higher level guild so he he was one of the last vestiges of people still able to think
[02:45:28.920 --> 02:45:34.920]  and so his guild was the most oppressed and watched and that's who you are in the media out there
[02:45:34.920 --> 02:45:40.520]  you republican and conservative hacks but it's the spirit of truth that will drive a herald
[02:45:40.520 --> 02:45:47.240]  over vera who in his heart wants to be part of the truth doesn't want to be a sellout to come out
[02:45:47.240 --> 02:45:52.760]  and say 9-11 could be an inside job and undoubtedly fur was flying behind the scenes and then
[02:45:52.760 --> 02:45:59.160]  napolitano co-hosting for beck his own top-rated show on fox business to say the whole things
[02:45:59.160 --> 02:46:04.280]  a lie on my show there was stuff behind the scenes you wouldn't believe out of that there was calls
[02:46:04.280 --> 02:46:10.760]  all over national media including cnn for his firing msnbc but he couldn't lie at the point
[02:46:10.760 --> 02:46:18.040]  that it mattered because he's not stupid he has intense deep knowledge and so he understands the
[02:46:18.040 --> 02:46:25.320]  truth innately and even if it hurts his career he couldn't lie when asked the question but we have
[02:46:25.320 --> 02:46:31.320]  to go past the point of not lying when we're put on the stand in front of the court of public opinion
[02:46:31.320 --> 02:46:39.640]  and he told the truth when he was in that witness seat on this show that isn't enough but that's
[02:46:39.640 --> 02:46:45.400]  more than 99 percent of people of god you need when you have the opportunity to be a witness
[02:46:45.400 --> 02:46:53.960]  not just when you're asked and when you take that on i mean you know a lot of people i understand
[02:46:54.680 --> 02:46:58.760]  what people that have not been fulfilled in life and who have not been successful in life
[02:46:58.760 --> 02:47:05.560]  can see somebody like me and they cannot imagine that i'm real they cannot imagine that i'm pure
[02:47:05.560 --> 02:47:09.960]  they cannot imagine that this is actually happening because they don't have faith in themselves
[02:47:09.960 --> 02:47:15.160]  they don't have faith in mankind they don't they can't believe that somebody came up lifted
[02:47:15.160 --> 02:47:20.600]  themselves up by their bootstraps out of the middle of texas and it's now reaching millions of new
[02:47:20.600 --> 02:47:29.720]  people a day seriously damaging the globalist agenda they can't believe that it could be real
[02:47:29.720 --> 02:47:38.120]  because they can't believe in themselves and i'm telling you believe in yourself believe in truth
[02:47:38.680 --> 02:47:46.200]  stand on it hold fast to it the truth will set you free and even if people can analyze alex
[02:47:46.200 --> 02:47:51.880]  jones who's just another person like everybody else and find my faults at my core i love liberty
[02:47:51.880 --> 02:47:56.840]  i want justice i want a free world where our children and grandchildren can enjoy these
[02:47:56.840 --> 02:48:04.200]  technologies and and and do things we can't even imagine my heart's in the right place
[02:48:05.320 --> 02:48:10.120]  but if your heart's in the right place and you can do it better and you've got better ideas do it
[02:48:10.120 --> 02:48:19.160]  show us lead us buy your example that's all i ask because i know the direction we're going
[02:48:20.040 --> 02:48:27.560]  is a nightmare there's no doubt about that and so let us not make it about the personalities
[02:48:27.560 --> 02:48:32.280]  about alex jones or about anybody else because i don't want it to be about that in a worldly sense
[02:48:32.280 --> 02:48:38.120]  that is empowering for me i don't want that worldly power i don't want that ring of mordor
[02:48:38.120 --> 02:48:43.640]  that corrupts that cannot be used for good i want you the individual to be empowered by
[02:48:43.640 --> 02:48:51.400]  my successful example which as scarred and stinking as it is is the most successful thing in modern
[02:48:51.400 --> 02:49:00.680]  history next to the long 40 year road of ron paul after that it's the biggest thing there is and
[02:49:00.680 --> 02:49:10.680]  it's not that big it's power and where it is big is through you you are the key you are the secret
[02:49:10.680 --> 02:49:15.000]  so don't let the enemy distract you or divert you take action stand up get involved today
[02:49:15.800 --> 02:49:20.120]  and that's my testament on liberty let's talk to sun fest in california you're on the air
[02:49:21.320 --> 02:49:25.800]  but you have to be given a chance to tell the truth out of the out of the nightmare and i've
[02:49:25.800 --> 02:49:33.480]  worked on this all my life using only those facts not over informed under educated but those facts
[02:49:33.480 --> 02:49:43.160]  that compile a solution uh only fasting and christ fasted buda fasted and so on only fasting can
[02:49:43.160 --> 02:49:49.800]  stop the fire out of control in the adrenaline behind the predator economy because that's all
[02:49:49.800 --> 02:49:53.960]  it is let me give you an example ma'am ma'am ma'am you called us just a few days ago and you do call
[02:49:53.960 --> 02:49:59.000]  the office quite a bit and i understand why don't you write an article for us so we can look over it
[02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:04.600]  and i do think fasting is important to detoxify the body i've never done it i should do it and
[02:50:04.600 --> 02:50:09.240]  and and to spend the time to refocus i think all the time about leaving for a week or two and you
[02:50:09.240 --> 02:50:13.880]  know getting a cabin somewhere by myself to fast and try to get myself you know refocused
[02:50:14.600 --> 02:50:20.440]  because this isn't such important work and i think what you say is is important ma'am but
[02:50:20.440 --> 02:50:26.840]  um there's no need to call us 100 to 200 times a day or at the office it's a full time i mean
[02:50:26.840 --> 02:50:30.600]  seriously we couldn't listen to all those messages even if we tried and a lot of people email me and
[02:50:30.600 --> 02:50:34.760]  they say why don't you screen your calls we don't screen our calls because we have you know people
[02:50:34.760 --> 02:50:38.440]  that get in but then regular callers get in most of the time instead of the millions that are trying
[02:50:38.440 --> 02:50:43.880]  to get in like i'm gonna jam in a few final calls in the final segment straight ahead uh but um
[02:50:46.120 --> 02:50:48.840]  i did overdrive for an hour yesterday i don't think i'm gonna do that today because we got a
[02:50:48.840 --> 02:50:53.080]  lot of work we got to get done oh they're kim trailing us heavily here in austin texas it's
[02:50:53.080 --> 02:50:57.720]  just incredible a program's even admitted but the public can't admit it to themselves i mean
[02:50:57.720 --> 02:51:04.200]  the globalists are so far down the line is it really possible to get out of debt without payment
[02:51:04.200 --> 02:51:09.400]  plans or attorneys 18 years ago we developed a program that has made thousands debt free in

[02:54:31.880 --> 02:54:38.040]  and i'll take comments off air um i believe that this whole china thing is scriptural because
[02:54:38.760 --> 02:54:46.680]  the uh in revelation nine it specifically talks about a 200 million man army now that was
[02:54:46.680 --> 02:54:56.040]  written thousands of years ago and china has a 200 man or 200 million uh men surplus that's my
[02:54:56.040 --> 02:55:02.680]  first point uh second thing on the tsa um i live in pennsylvania i can walk into any gun store i want
[02:55:02.680 --> 02:55:09.400]  to with my id and in 10 minutes walk out with a right for a handgun and uh the third thing was
[02:55:09.960 --> 02:55:16.360]  on the chris mathes issue i was very upset about that i called them as mbc and made my
[02:55:16.360 --> 02:55:23.480]  um concerns known and there's a number if we can do like a phone bomb maybe the last fine but i mean
[02:55:23.480 --> 02:55:28.040]  they tell him to create racial enmity when he calls white people crackers and says if you don't
[02:55:28.040 --> 02:55:32.680]  like big government you secretly burn crosses i mean that's his job but yeah we can give out the
[02:55:32.680 --> 02:55:41.320]  number for slimeball if you want two one two six six four four four four four four all right thank
[02:55:41.320 --> 02:55:44.600]  thank you very much thank you i mean i don't know what comments i can make you just said it all right
[02:55:44.600 --> 02:55:53.800]  there jonathan in kansas you're on the year yes um alex i just want to talk about uh a few things
[02:55:54.520 --> 02:56:00.280]  are you aware of the dioxin scare in germany and how many farms were shut down and you see a lot of
[02:56:00.280 --> 02:56:06.360]  people who are running towards organic food yes and here they just cover it up when you get dioxin
[02:56:06.360 --> 02:56:10.520]  and wonder why your kidneys fail at 30 but yeah they've had to kill a bunch of the farm animals
[02:56:10.520 --> 02:56:15.000]  pigs and others because there's just so much toxic garbage in the food chain germany and other
[02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:19.320]  countries will hardly even let chinese food additives in they make the bulk additives over here
[02:56:19.320 --> 02:56:23.720]  over here they don't even check them china makes many of our prescription and over the counter
[02:56:23.720 --> 02:56:30.920]  drugs and exports their toxic waste here it's it's it's totally it's insane yeah also i wanted to
[02:56:30.920 --> 02:56:39.400]  talk about some social engineering and you said with uh what's her name uh you had her a few weeks
[02:56:39.400 --> 02:56:45.240]  ago he was talking about how infiltration of conservative groups charlotte something yum
[02:56:45.240 --> 02:56:53.240]  yeah yeah well you know how you talked about how uh public schooling was created in prussia
[02:56:53.240 --> 02:57:00.600]  well not only that many other social um the social welfare programs for example the first uh
[02:57:01.320 --> 02:57:08.200]  tested um what do you call it social security was actually developed by the king of prussia
[02:57:08.200 --> 02:57:14.520]  and he said he thought it was a way to like counter like there used to be coal miners that
[02:57:14.520 --> 02:57:20.200]  had their own social security and people would put money into this pot and people who ever get hurt
[02:57:20.200 --> 02:57:25.640]  would get uh use that money but yeah they don't want you investing your own money they want to
[02:57:25.640 --> 02:57:29.800]  make you invest it with them so they can steal it no no i mean if you go back to prussia which
[02:57:29.800 --> 02:57:36.200]  its main product was soldier slaves who were so mind controlled they would you know lovingly go off
[02:57:36.200 --> 02:57:41.480]  and fight and kill including in the you know the war against the british uh he said he bought some
[02:57:41.480 --> 02:57:45.960]  from his cousin uh king george the third did some prussians most of them did run off once they got
[02:57:45.960 --> 02:57:52.360]  here though uh and almost everything the mind control psychology it all came out of prussia
[02:57:52.360 --> 02:57:59.880]  that's actually true yeah and also the i want to ask you a question is daniel bell the guy who
[02:57:59.880 --> 02:58:06.840]  created the book uh post industrial society is he a high level globalist like uh mouthpiece because
[02:58:06.840 --> 02:58:13.000]  he talked about how social welfare programs was gonna he said heavy industry was going to leave
[02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:18.280]  the west and yeah well you've got the u n you've got the head of the goddard space center you've
[02:58:18.280 --> 02:58:22.920]  got them all saying we're gonna artificially get rid of industry we're gonna make you communalized
[02:58:22.920 --> 02:58:28.040]  farms under corporate control so you can never rebel it's called domestication uh you know just
[02:58:28.040 --> 02:58:32.280]  like they breed animals to be subservient they're artificially creating a society where you got a
[02:58:32.280 --> 02:58:37.960]  bunch of dumbed-down childlike adults who are a bunch of people who submit to tyranny i'll see
[02:58:37.960 --> 02:58:44.760]  you back uh live tomorrow retransmission starts now are you tired of searching for great talk radio

[02:58:51.880 --> 02:58:56.680]  alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over it ended on june of
[02:58:56.680 --> 02:59:02.680]  2009 the millions of americans unable to find work might not agree perhaps a recession ended
[02:59:02.680 --> 02:59:07.240]  for the bankers and government employees but for the rest of us things seem to be getting worse
[02:59:07.240 --> 02:59:12.360]  gold and silver haven't heard the news either they've begun their long expected journey to the moon
