[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.720]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:20.720 --> 00:38.920]  All right, folks, get ready. I'm running on about three hours sleep, and so that should
[00:38.920 --> 00:42.400]  provide us with an interesting show. I've noticed some of my best broadcasts when I'm
[00:42.400 --> 00:48.520]  exhausted. I flew up a month ago to confront Piers Morgan in New York and got on a plane
[00:48.520 --> 00:53.120]  at six in the morning and flew back. So I got about three hours sleep then. I drove
[00:53.120 --> 00:57.080]  about two and a half hours to the edge of Houston, the little town called Katy, well,
[00:57.080 --> 01:02.900]  it's about 20,000 people, to protest Piers Morgan last night.
[01:02.900 --> 01:09.240]  And he had on his show the Texas Attorney General, and he also had on the transmission
[01:09.240 --> 01:15.480]  with Piers Morgan, frequent guests on our show, that we need to get him back on. That,
[01:15.480 --> 01:23.800]  of course, is Ted Nugent. But on my way down there, I got a call that the owner of Tactical
[01:23.800 --> 01:29.140]  Firearms was calling, trying to get a hold of me at the office.
[01:29.140 --> 01:33.400]  So I called him and he said, listen, I'm a listener. And that's just info in the media
[01:33.400 --> 01:39.980]  that I said we should have background checks for ammo. And by the way, I'll let you come
[01:39.980 --> 01:44.840]  in and say hi to him in the green room to surprise him. But you gotta promise not to
[01:44.840 --> 01:46.720]  be mean to him.
[01:46.720 --> 01:51.960]  So by the time I got there, cuz we stopped in eight and a few things, cuz I knew they
[01:51.960 --> 01:55.320]  were going live, so I thought, well, I'm not in a hurry. But again, Piers Morgan shot most
[01:55.320 --> 02:00.040]  of it taped, it turned out. By the time I got there, Piers Morgan wasn't in the area
[02:00.040 --> 02:05.080]  off to where they were setting up in one of the biggest shooting ranges in the country.
[02:05.080 --> 02:11.900]  He was in there already shooting, in the midst of shooting, I think it was 10 different guns,
[02:11.900 --> 02:16.800]  so he could demonize them properly. And they just walked me right in there. And I didn't
[02:16.800 --> 02:21.360]  know Piers Morgan was gonna be in that room. I was going to meet with the owner of Tactical
[02:21.360 --> 02:26.260]  Firearms, cuz that's who I was gonna talk to first to see, hey, can I go talk to Piers?
[02:26.260 --> 02:31.960]  And thank God, I said, you know what, I better just start my iPhone. And I walk through and
[02:31.960 --> 02:34.560]  it's Piers Morgan, and I didn't catch it on tape.
[02:34.560 --> 02:42.400]  But Jeremy Alcide, the owner, says that he has like high def surveillance cameras and
[02:42.400 --> 02:46.080]  audio of everything, he's gonna give it to us. And I saw it though, Piers Morgan literally
[02:46.080 --> 02:51.960]  kind of stepped back and was like, whoa, like he'd seen a ghost. It was worth a million
[02:51.960 --> 03:00.400]  bucks. And I've been bullhorning, I bullhorned, I don't know, off and on for about an hour
[03:00.400 --> 03:06.600]  and a half, two hours. So I've got more of a Batman voice today, I don't mean to talk
[03:06.600 --> 03:07.600]  like this.
[03:07.600 --> 03:12.440]  It's kind of comical in a way, but this is what my voice has turned into. You've given
[03:12.440 --> 03:22.000]  everything you've got, Batman. I haven't given enough. Imagine those actors trying to talk
[03:22.000 --> 03:31.000]  like that, it's pretty ridiculous. So here I am, here I am. And my voice will actually
[03:31.000 --> 03:32.000]  come back, it's funny.
[03:32.000 --> 03:36.320]  When I haven't been talking since I've been ranting and screaming, when I first get on
[03:36.320 --> 03:41.280]  the air, it's really hard to talk. But once I've been on a little while, it takes a little
[03:41.280 --> 03:48.800]  bit easier.
[03:48.800 --> 03:55.640]  When we come back from break, I will go over all the top headlines that are up on infowars.com.
[03:55.640 --> 04:02.020]  Author and former intelligence contract pilot accused in murder, suicide. Man, the way they
[04:02.020 --> 04:07.380]  love to kill people is they will shoot your wife, shoot your kids, shoot you and say you
[04:07.380 --> 04:11.440]  did it. That is so common.
[04:11.440 --> 04:16.440]  America next, vigilante, malicious patrol Mexico. And in the areas where they're doing,
[04:16.440 --> 04:20.560]  that's the only areas that are safe. Yeah, when the government's corrupt, people take
[04:20.560 --> 04:26.200]  the law into their own hands. Globalist funded think tank says poverty will save the planet.
[04:26.200 --> 04:30.080]  And that's always been the plan. But here they are again saying, cut off the resources,
[04:30.080 --> 04:33.080]  make everybody poor. That's the answer to everything.
[04:33.080 --> 04:36.760]  US government says drone striking Americans is legal. That's why they're gearing up for
[04:36.760 --> 04:42.760]  it domestically. The video's up on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com. Alex Jones confronts Piers
[04:42.760 --> 04:47.120]  Morgan at gun range. We're going to play that video and audio. Ted Nugent says full of crap.
[04:47.120 --> 04:53.480]  Piers Morgan needs to leave gun owners the hell alone. And I left before Ted Nugent came
[04:53.480 --> 04:56.800]  out at the end because I knew we had to drive back to Austin, but he drove by, rolled on
[04:56.800 --> 05:01.080]  the window and said, I'm going to kick his ass for you.
[05:01.080 --> 05:05.760]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our

[08:25.240 --> 08:47.800]  Waging war on corruption. Crashing through the lies and disinformation. I'm Alex Jones,
[08:47.800 --> 08:54.040]  your host. And we're here Monday through Friday, 12 noon to 3 p.m. Eastern. Blasting out on
[08:54.040 --> 09:01.240]  XM 166 over 150 a.m. and FM affiliates and of course the Internet with audio streams,
[09:01.240 --> 09:07.160]  the free podcast and more at info wars dot com, prison planet dot com and info wars news
[09:07.160 --> 09:11.360]  dot com and prison planet dot TV for the video feeds.
[09:11.360 --> 09:16.520]  Wow. Same story that we have every day, but worse every day. Just so much info. It is
[09:16.520 --> 09:25.360]  all off the charts what we're gonna be covering here today. Coming up here in about 25 minutes
[09:25.360 --> 09:30.680]  from now, we're going to have the owner of Tactical Firearms, one of the biggest shooting
[09:30.680 --> 09:34.720]  ranges and gun shops in the country.
[09:34.720 --> 09:41.760]  He's going to be joining us. He had Piers Morgan in his operation yesterday in Katy,
[09:41.760 --> 09:47.360]  Texas, just west of Houston. And some people will ask, why are you following Piers Morgan?
[09:47.360 --> 09:51.680]  Why are you talking about him? Piers Morgan only has a half million viewers. Yes, I know
[09:51.680 --> 09:59.020]  that. I know that. But the rest of the globalist media is promoting him and pushing his sound
[09:59.020 --> 10:03.920]  bites so he's the main voice of the White House.
[10:03.920 --> 10:10.240]  They admit they're in consultation with the White House. And so we are responding to them.
[10:10.240 --> 10:15.280]  He puts out the talking points that are picked up everywhere else. And so when he comes to
[10:15.280 --> 10:19.320]  Texas, we have to go there. And I did go there yesterday and I'll tell you about what happened
[10:19.320 --> 10:20.320]  behind the scenes.
[10:20.320 --> 10:25.000]  And by the way, Rob Dues got the footage. We got home at 1.30 in the morning, back to
[10:25.000 --> 10:29.960]  the office. It's high def footage. He went in and downloaded it so he could edit it this
[10:29.960 --> 10:34.380]  morning because there's hours of it. And so we'll have that out later in the day, surely
[10:34.380 --> 10:37.120]  by Infowars Nightly News, 7 o'clock tonight.
[10:37.120 --> 10:40.640]  It's gonna be live, by the way, with Aaron Dykes. It's gonna be live tonight. More and
[10:40.640 --> 10:45.400]  more, it's live. Sometimes part of it's live, some of it's already been taped. This is live
[10:45.400 --> 10:52.040]  tonight, 7 o'clock central. Infowars Nightly News that airs via the subscribers and then
[10:52.040 --> 10:56.240]  goes out on a lot of different cable systems and folks actually download it and air it.
[10:56.240 --> 11:05.660]  It's prisonplanet.tv, infowarsnews.com. But it was just amazing how CNN was behaving behind
[11:05.660 --> 11:10.720]  the scenes. And then as soon as we turned our cameras off, they ran up and said, are
[11:10.720 --> 11:11.720]  you ready to come back?
[11:11.720 --> 11:22.000]  I'm with peers, you'll be nice. Do it by satellite, are you ready? It's just so funny. But the
[11:22.000 --> 11:31.340]  reason we went down there is you see Obama running around with the shotgun photo, firing
[11:31.340 --> 11:38.920]  the shotgun, saying he's skeet shooting. And you see Biden saying, nobody's gonna take
[11:38.920 --> 11:39.920]  my Beretta.
[11:39.920 --> 11:43.080]  And Obama saying, I pledge you never take your guns. It's the same stuff from four years
[11:43.080 --> 11:47.360]  ago. Whenever they think they have the initiative and can blame gun owners for some tragedy,
[11:47.360 --> 11:50.300]  they're like, you're all murderers, you're clan members, you helped kill the children
[11:50.300 --> 11:51.300]  at Sandy Hook.
[11:51.300 --> 11:54.820]  You're the scum of the Earth, we defeated Hitler, we can defeat you. You are the trash
[11:54.820 --> 11:58.680]  of the planet, you are the garbage, you are the filth. We have a right to not be endangered
[11:58.680 --> 12:04.160]  by you evil white southerners. We will overcome the Constitution, just all the race-baiting
[12:04.160 --> 12:06.320]  division, balkanization.
[12:06.320 --> 12:10.640]  But as soon as the data mining comes out that Forbes reported on, in fact, I never covered
[12:10.640 --> 12:14.760]  that properly Sunday. I wanna bring that up when the owner of tactical firearms comes
[12:14.760 --> 12:21.280]  on. Will you guys re-pull me out of Sunday's stack the article about NRA winning the gun
[12:21.280 --> 12:22.280]  battle?
[12:22.280 --> 12:27.600]  And again, it's not the NRA, the NRA speaks for all gun owners. Well, they could be taken
[12:27.600 --> 12:31.600]  over, they could be infiltrated, they could be shut down. No, it's the Second Amendment,
[12:31.600 --> 12:36.600]  our forebearers, the Republic, the country born out of the attempt to take guns.
[12:36.600 --> 12:41.200]  They wanna make it about the NRA, so it's not about the Second Amendment. But the point
[12:41.200 --> 12:46.080]  is the big data mining companies say, look, it's conclusive. This is backfired on the
[12:46.080 --> 12:50.080]  gun grabbers. I don't need data mining to know this. I track things, I watch things,
[12:50.080 --> 12:52.160]  I really tell you what I believe.
[12:52.160 --> 12:58.720]  I don't get up here and just say something because I think it's what I want to happen.
[12:58.720 --> 13:02.760]  Mitt Romney, there it is, NRA winning the influence battle over gun control. I'm gonna
[13:02.760 --> 13:08.840]  cover that later. Mitt Romney was a globalist. Mitt Romney was there, though, to act like
[13:08.840 --> 13:16.240]  a constitutionalist or conservative slash libertarian so he could take the seat of that
[13:16.240 --> 13:18.480]  and represent it to then lose.
[13:18.480 --> 13:21.560]  This is the globalist program. I don't know if Mitt Romney was let in on this, but this
[13:21.560 --> 13:26.240]  is clearly what happened. Show that he could put out those debates, they could be falsely
[13:26.240 --> 13:31.120]  discredited, and then they could say it was a mandate for socialism, open borders, world
[13:31.120 --> 13:35.800]  government, gun control, UN controlling our military, which we're now told.
[13:35.800 --> 13:40.240]  And Republicans come out and say, I guess it's a mandate. Yeah, we've gotta do whatever
[13:40.240 --> 13:44.520]  the Democrats want. Yeah, it's a mandate. Really, Congress has a 9% approval rating?
[13:44.520 --> 13:51.840]  This is a rigged system. And the reason we're being told there's a mandate, and Republicans
[13:51.840 --> 13:56.880]  are even saying, do what the Democrats say more and more. And there's these few extremist
[13:56.880 --> 14:01.980]  Republicans in the House that only care about their constituents, how about the Constitution?
[14:01.980 --> 14:07.460]  And so we've gotta get rid of them and then America can go into the future with real change,
[14:07.460 --> 14:09.700]  change you can believe in.
[14:09.700 --> 14:16.120]  The mega banks have the same policy from Australia, to Germany, to Canada, to the United States.
[14:16.120 --> 14:27.820]  From Mexico to Brazil, from Nigeria to South Africa. From the Horn of Africa to the streets
[14:27.820 --> 14:34.260]  of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, they want the public poor and deindustrialized and controlled with
[14:34.260 --> 14:37.120]  only a few monopoly corporations controlling it.
[14:37.120 --> 14:42.120]  That's the real world paradigm, that's what's happening. I mean, here they are today, I've
[14:42.120 --> 14:48.400]  got mainstream news articles and Kurt Nemo wrote about it at info wars.com. Author and
[14:48.400 --> 14:53.120]  former intelligence contract pilot accused of murder, suicide, we're gonna get to that.
[14:53.120 --> 15:00.720]  But another Kurt Nemo article, globalist funded think tank says poverty will save the planet.
[15:00.720 --> 15:06.960]  And then they've got another article out today saying, well, what we need to do is we need
[15:06.960 --> 15:15.320]  to have people just work less and have less and that's gonna save the earth.
[15:15.320 --> 15:20.040]  That's in my stack of news. And see, that's what Obamacare does. The average worker now
[15:20.040 --> 15:25.760]  is going from about 40 hours a week to less than 30. Because under Obamacare written by
[15:25.760 --> 15:33.760]  the big corporations, they don't have to give you coverage. And so it is a permanently underemployed
[15:33.760 --> 15:41.080]  population of working poor. This is wealth destruction.
[15:41.080 --> 15:45.640]  And they just, I mean, I remember three years ago going in Whole Foods or back in 2008,
[15:45.640 --> 15:52.880]  when they engineered that old crash, I guess five years ago. Man, how time flies. And half
[15:52.880 --> 15:57.440]  the magazines, we even went and shot video and did reports on it, said austerity is fun,
[15:57.440 --> 16:02.000]  it's cool, it lowers your carbon footprint, being poor is cool.
[16:02.000 --> 16:07.400]  Get ready to be real poor. Get ready for your power prices to double and triple. And driving
[16:07.400 --> 16:17.000]  home from Southeast Texas, just west of Houston from the Piers Morgan situation last night
[16:17.000 --> 16:23.560]  that I'm gonna talk about in a moment. I saw the town of Fayetteville and the famous modern
[16:23.560 --> 16:32.640]  example 20 year old, clean burning power plant of Fayetteville that supplies part of Houston's
[16:32.640 --> 16:33.640]  power.
[16:33.640 --> 16:38.440]  But one third of the unit, there's three power plants, supplies Austin. And I'd read that
[16:38.440 --> 16:42.140]  they were gonna go ahead and start powering it down and shutting it down. And that Austin
[16:42.140 --> 16:49.040]  was gonna shut it down, it's part of the plant, until it could be sold, of course, to insiders
[16:49.040 --> 16:54.580]  for nothing that we paid for.
[16:54.580 --> 16:59.160]  Some astronomical amount, I forget the numbers, like $700 million or something Austin paid
[16:59.160 --> 17:03.720]  for. I mean, just type it up, Austin to shut down Fayetteville plant. They've shut down
[17:03.720 --> 17:09.760]  our other two plants, now our final plant, yep, that's it. And we're driving by at like
[17:09.760 --> 17:14.520]  midnight by Fayetteville.
[17:14.520 --> 17:20.080]  And I see the two that supply Houston, the two smoke stacks that have the two factories,
[17:20.080 --> 17:23.520]  the two factories of power, the two clean burning coal plants on them. And then that
[17:23.520 --> 17:27.420]  one and the no smoke was coming out of it. Of course, it's not really smoke, it was cold
[17:27.420 --> 17:28.680]  last night.
[17:28.680 --> 17:35.740]  It's water vapor and carbon dioxide, but the media tells you it's smoke. Look, dirty smoke,
[17:35.740 --> 17:41.440]  and there it is just turned off. So Austin has to buy its power from Boone Pickens. See
[17:41.440 --> 17:46.400]  that insider deal he's got. And so Austin has to buy its power from Mexico. They ship
[17:46.400 --> 17:52.020]  power and loses a bunch of it over the lines, all the way from Mexico now, out of dirty
[17:52.020 --> 17:54.120]  burning plants.
[17:54.120 --> 17:59.980]  So globalist insiders that gave money to the city council can make cash. And again, that's
[17:59.980 --> 18:04.760]  how my brain works. Everywhere I go, I just see they're evil. The average person would
[18:04.760 --> 18:09.260]  never know Fayetteville's where we got now half our power. They've shut down the other
[18:09.260 --> 18:15.040]  two plants. We were self-sufficient. Austin owned three plants, three plants, and was
[18:15.040 --> 18:20.400]  100% self-sufficient, and had incredibly cheap power, some of the cheapest in the country.
[18:20.400 --> 18:24.720]  It is now double. This is all the Austin American statesmen, they're very proud of it. And the
[18:24.720 --> 18:28.640]  mayor says it's for the earth, and it's gonna double again.
[18:28.640 --> 18:36.400]  But remember, remember, the government district is exempt from the rolling blackouts and the
[18:36.400 --> 18:41.840]  power price increases, and select corporations are given that same pay rate, that same rate
[18:41.840 --> 18:47.840]  card. I mean, this is the real discrimination. While we're all worried about black, white,
[18:47.840 --> 18:52.020]  Hispanic, all this garbage, while they're trying to inject that all day, so we're thinking
[18:52.020 --> 18:56.280]  that's where the real action's going on, globalist are exempt.
[18:56.280 --> 19:00.600]  They take $85 billion a month, and less than 10 billion of it, this is even in the Wall
[19:00.600 --> 19:05.800]  Street Journal, goes to bankers and people. And they argue, hey, we're not getting this
[19:05.800 --> 19:10.520]  money for ourselves. No, it goes to prop up derivatives, but a little dirty secret. They've
[19:10.520 --> 19:14.600]  already written off most of those derivatives, they're already triaged.
[19:14.600 --> 19:19.840]  They just take the money, the 85 billion, and shove it into that black hole to destroy
[19:19.840 --> 19:26.120]  the money. Because they're creating so much fiat currency, they sell the service, they
[19:26.120 --> 19:31.400]  wanna control inflation. But really what it's all about is just destroying our wealth, because
[19:31.400 --> 19:35.960]  the globalists have unlimited fiat, but then it'll lose value if they don't destroy our
[19:35.960 --> 19:38.000]  wealth, you understand?
[19:38.000 --> 19:43.420]  So that's how they get wealthy, just like shutting off Iraqi oil is what the oil companies
[19:43.420 --> 19:48.680]  wanted to boost prices. Something they wanted more oil, they wanted less oil, same deal.
[19:48.680 --> 19:52.440]  They don't want more power, they want less power, power they own. See how that works?
[19:52.440 --> 19:57.520]  And they're taking old ladies' houses for unpaid income tax they can't pay and stuff,
[19:57.520 --> 20:00.680]  to then just shove it into a black hole and burn it.
[20:00.680 --> 20:05.360]  Looking back on 2012, I know personally I'm thanking God that my family and I made it
[20:05.360 --> 20:09.360]  through the year. From natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy, and the devastating summer
[20:09.360 --> 20:13.600]  drought, to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy. Our hearts go out
[20:13.600 --> 20:17.680]  to those that have lost everything. My friends at eFoods Direct hear from customers every

[20:26.120 --> 20:30.120]  stores are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just in time to be able to help my
[20:30.120 --> 20:34.440]  sister and my niece. Bottom line, it's better to be prepared 10 years too early than one

[22:31.520 --> 22:36.080]  why banks, stock workers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs? They've been available
[22:36.080 --> 22:41.380]  since 1986 yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.

[23:00.720 --> 23:05.840]  your year to achieve more? More vitality, more health, more well-being? Hi, this is
[23:05.840 --> 23:10.840]  Pastor Jenny. For 25 years I spent my life's work teaching others how to achieve more.
[23:10.840 --> 23:16.580]  But in 2010 I got a lesson of my own about RNA drops. I learned that there are millions
[23:16.580 --> 23:21.240]  of gene switches latent in every single cell of my body that are waiting for an activator.
[23:21.240 --> 23:26.360]  I learned by taking RNA drops I could begin to activate that power in my cells and achieve
[23:26.360 --> 23:30.640]  the more that I desire. I'd like to share what I discovered with you and send you a
[23:30.640 --> 23:36.520]  free 30-day supply of RNA drops valued at $50 for just the cost of shipping and handling.
[23:36.520 --> 23:46.880]  Go to rnafreesample.com, that's rnafreesample.com, or call me toll free at 888-577-3703, that's
[23:46.880 --> 24:11.840]  888-577-3703, rnafreesample.com. Discover the more that's waiting for you.
[24:11.840 --> 24:17.880]  I know I rant a lot about power plants. It just really gets to me that the power prices
[24:17.880 --> 24:24.240]  where I live have doubled the last four or five years. It's a globalist plan. It's happening
[24:24.240 --> 24:28.880]  all over the country, but we are the model. And they're on the news saying, it's for the
[24:28.880 --> 24:33.320]  earth, we're gonna charge you even more. But by the way, we the elite are exempt, the alpha
[24:33.320 --> 24:39.840]  maggots. And that just illustrates everything I'm talking about in this country. And it's
[24:39.840 --> 24:44.080]  happening all over the world and they are going to continue to drop the hammer on us
[24:44.080 --> 24:46.680]  until we wake up.
[24:46.680 --> 24:51.600]  They're going to impoverish everybody. I don't care if you're a bureaucrat, a police officer,
[24:51.600 --> 24:59.600]  a firefighter, a school teacher, a code enforcer. This is horrible what's happening. And I know
[24:59.600 --> 25:04.800]  most people in government aren't actively evil. You're just yes men. But my goodness,
[25:04.800 --> 25:07.840]  it's time to say no. But regardless, if you don't do the right thing in government, that's
[25:07.840 --> 25:11.320]  your issue. You continue to say people that don't like the government are terrorists.
[25:11.320 --> 25:17.400]  We're extremists trying to label us. That is only woken people up that much more. I
[25:17.400 --> 25:20.160]  talked to a lot of police officers last night that were out there cuz the Attorney General
[25:20.160 --> 25:24.040]  of Texas was there and a bunch of other stuff and they were all awake.
[25:24.040 --> 25:30.120]  All those Katy police officers. I talked to a whole bunch of veterans there that run security
[25:30.120 --> 25:35.600]  at the biggest, the biggest I guess shooting range in the country. That is indoor shooting
[25:35.600 --> 25:39.880]  range. We can rent full auto and the rest of it to test them out. One of the biggest
[25:39.880 --> 25:44.640]  silencer sellers in the country for people that get the ATF stamp, all the rest of it.
[25:44.640 --> 25:50.520]  The point is, that fella's coming up in the next segment. It's just that people know we're
[25:50.520 --> 25:54.720]  going down the road to tyranny. We just need to figure out how to put the brakes on.
[25:54.720 --> 25:59.600]  And we have those remedies. It's just that those of us that know the remedies from the
[25:59.600 --> 26:03.840]  Bill of Rights, Constitution, Declaration of Independence, America, that's what makes
[26:03.840 --> 26:08.240]  America America and our enforcement of those laws.
[26:08.240 --> 26:13.160]  We have to rediscover that and enforce them and we're going to be called terrorist because
[26:13.160 --> 26:19.920]  a foreign power has taken the country over. A foreign corporate power that's slick and
[26:19.920 --> 26:23.800]  has all the PR. But at the end of the day, it's still a fraud and a lie. Now, I didn't
[26:23.800 --> 26:27.000]  even get to this yesterday. I'm gonna get into the whole Piers Morgan thing in the next
[26:27.000 --> 26:32.320]  segment and play the audio and video of my backstage confrontation with him.
[26:32.320 --> 26:36.720]  It was friendly till the end, cuz I promised if they let me in there to surprise him, I'd
[26:36.720 --> 26:43.160]  be nice. And I'm a man of my word. They got a little snotty and then I got a little snotty
[26:43.160 --> 26:48.520]  with them. Jesse Jackson pushed his new Occupy plan, had Homeland Security occupy Chicago
[26:48.520 --> 26:50.320]  with armed TSA agents.
[26:50.320 --> 26:55.320]  And that's up at infowars.com. We wrote about it yesterday. Mike Adams also wrote about
[26:55.320 --> 27:02.280]  that report over at naturalnews.com. But the issue here is that people said, that's just
[27:02.280 --> 27:08.200]  Jesse Jackson saying we need to have federal troops and TSA to stop the crime wave in Chicago
[27:08.200 --> 27:10.040]  where they've taken the guns from the people.
[27:10.040 --> 27:16.760]  And you can look at them banning the guns in the 80s. In fact, I was just looking at
[27:16.760 --> 27:22.600]  a graph in one of our reports last night. And you just see the crime rate explode after
[27:22.600 --> 27:27.560]  that. It's absolutely cause and effect, it's well known. Where there's more guns than legal
[27:27.560 --> 27:31.800]  hands, crime rate goes down cuz criminals are scared.
[27:31.800 --> 27:34.760]  Look at carjackings all over the country. They were an epidemic. Don't hear about those
[27:34.760 --> 27:38.720]  a lot except if it's Chicago or New York or LA, cuz you get your butt blown off doing
[27:38.720 --> 27:43.860]  that. I mean, probably half the cars driving around in Texas are packing heat. Half the
[27:43.860 --> 27:47.600]  women that I run into are packing heat in their purse.
[27:47.600 --> 27:52.120]  And it really scares the criminals. That's like police on the street. That's all it is.
[27:52.120 --> 27:55.400]  You can't have a cop there every time somebody commits a crime, but you can have a citizen
[27:55.400 --> 27:59.240]  there. And you're gonna have some bad stuff happen? Yeah, but statistically, it's much
[27:59.240 --> 28:05.200]  better to have guns everywhere than to not have them.
[28:05.200 --> 28:09.520]  But everybody already knows that. People know that. That's why they're losing the gun grabbing
[28:09.520 --> 28:14.060]  debate and they're panicking. And here's the Forbes article, NRA winning the influence
[28:14.060 --> 28:19.000]  battle over gun control. We're gonna break some of that down, but I wanted to play a
[28:19.000 --> 28:20.000]  clip here.
[28:20.000 --> 28:23.920]  Cuz I don't wanna just mention this and have new listeners not know that we're backing
[28:23.920 --> 28:29.400]  this up. I have all these different government people. It's not just Jesse Jackson. And I
[28:29.400 --> 28:34.440]  have TSA now with guns strapped to their hip, commando style, showing up where I live in
[28:34.440 --> 28:35.440]  Austin.
[28:35.440 --> 28:39.620]  They're everywhere. This is now happening. Army checkpoints, Marine Corps checkpoints,
[28:39.620 --> 28:44.800]  this is the plan. And they've had the governor of Illinois call for troops. They've had LA
[28:44.800 --> 28:51.360]  mayor call for feds on the streets, federal police, federal troops. I guess Chicago took
[28:51.360 --> 28:54.880]  over the federal government. So I guess the federal government now takes over Chicago,
[28:54.880 --> 28:56.440]  the joke goes.
[28:56.440 --> 29:00.080]  And all of this race card stuff against the Second Amendment doesn't make any sense. It
[29:00.080 --> 29:04.880]  turns the race card into the joker card. Let's go ahead and go to that quick clip of Obama
[29:04.880 --> 29:07.960]  with his domestic security force he called for. And guess what? They're now setting it
[29:07.960 --> 29:08.960]  up.
[29:08.960 --> 29:15.240]  We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security
[29:15.240 --> 29:20.360]  objectives that we've set. We've got to have a civilian national security force that's
[29:20.360 --> 29:24.880]  just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[29:24.880 --> 29:30.360]  Lenin, Stalin, Hitler, all of them never trust the original military when they take over.
[29:30.360 --> 29:34.560]  They always create a new domestic security force made up of goons, criminals, thugs and
[29:34.560 --> 29:38.880]  mercenaries. And that's what they're doing now under FEMA Corps. It's now rolling out
[29:38.880 --> 29:45.000]  with people in uniforms, many of them with sidearms commanding citizen goon forces, Nazi
[29:45.000 --> 29:46.000]  brown shirts.
[29:46.000 --> 29:49.760]  Stay with us. We'll be right back.
[29:49.760 --> 30:02.480]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[31:05.440 --> 31:11.040]  economic system runs from bad to worse. The globalist model is to shut down societies

[33:42.800 --> 33:49.160]  gun shops, gun stores slash biggest indoor shooting ranges I've ever seen. Reportedly,
[33:49.160 --> 33:54.280]  the biggest in the country outside Houston and I was blown away by it and a whole bunch
[33:54.280 --> 34:00.960]  of his crew, Iraq and Afghanistan veterans and Desert Storm 1 veterans that are his trainers
[34:00.960 --> 34:08.240]  and security team were listeners once I got down there and it was amazing to just see
[34:08.240 --> 34:14.320]  the response of the media to guys walking around basically in combat gear with their
[34:14.320 --> 34:20.560]  shotguns and AR-15s and their Reapers and the rest of it walking around on the edge
[34:20.560 --> 34:25.520]  of Houston in the middle of an office park next to restaurants and that's the image people
[34:25.520 --> 34:26.520]  need to get used to.
[34:26.520 --> 34:31.120]  If we, the citizens, want to go out dressed like the police all armed, that's all right
[34:31.120 --> 34:36.520]  if we feel like there's some type of danger out there. I felt completely safe with police
[34:36.520 --> 34:42.760]  and armed people all over the place. Where I don't feel safe is walking down the streets
[34:42.760 --> 34:49.040]  of one of the big city mafia run places where they have off the chart muggings.
[34:49.040 --> 34:53.620]  I was seeing the statistics today, like 160 plus thousand reported muggings in London
[34:53.620 --> 34:58.680]  every year. I mean, it is just incredible in the killings and the stabbings. We're gonna
[34:58.680 --> 35:03.440]  be talking about that. But some people ask me, why are you talking about Piers Morgan?
[35:03.440 --> 35:07.840]  If he has a half million viewers, on average, when I went on it was a million, then 800,000
[35:07.840 --> 35:09.280]  for the next week.
[35:09.280 --> 35:13.480]  And we have the CNN head producer saying, we wanna get you back on soon. It's just Piers
[35:13.480 --> 35:18.800]  really doesn't. We've never had ratings like this. Yeah, never had ratings in his two years
[35:18.800 --> 35:23.000]  on CNN until I went on there. And now he doesn't have them anymore. He's trying to get them
[35:23.000 --> 35:26.400]  back with Ted Nugent and people, it isn't gonna happen.
[35:26.400 --> 35:32.840]  People are sick of it. They want folks to get in the face of the gun grabbers. And that's
[35:32.840 --> 35:38.240]  why they wanna get me back on, but they got their clock cleaned because it broke people
[35:38.240 --> 35:46.480]  out of their trance. Tacticalfirearms.us if you wanna check out the site. Also, before
[35:46.480 --> 35:50.840]  we go to our guest and play a few clips here first, he joins us via video Skype.
[35:50.840 --> 35:57.800]  I saw in the news that they had said that this gentleman had said, I agree there should
[35:57.800 --> 36:03.000]  be background checks for bulk ammo buys. He never said that. And that was the media spinning
[36:03.000 --> 36:07.520]  when he'd been asked about that out of context. And Mike Adams has known him for about five
[36:07.520 --> 36:11.480]  years and Mike Adams says, he's the best guy he knows in firearms.
[36:11.480 --> 36:15.960]  And Mike's big into firearms. The Health Ranger, a frequent fill-in guest for us, contributor
[36:15.960 --> 36:23.640]  to Infowars Nightly News. So I apologized for it yesterday, but it's not an apology
[36:23.640 --> 36:29.240]  that I was wrong. I went with mainstream media that was spinning and I should know better.
[36:29.240 --> 36:33.820]  So I guess in a way it is an apology. You just cannot trust mainstream media. And no
[36:33.820 --> 36:39.320]  matter how much I know that, over and over again, I still think that you can believe
[36:39.320 --> 36:42.120]  what they're saying when it's local Houston media even.
[36:42.120 --> 36:47.480]  I tend to believe local mainstream media more than national mainstream media. And as a rule,
[36:47.480 --> 36:54.040]  that's generally true, but still it's a rule. There are major exceptions to that. Now, why
[36:54.040 --> 36:59.880]  is Piers Morgan doing all this? I have decided to engage Piers Morgan because I'm not gonna
[36:59.880 --> 37:02.620]  let him sit there and put out the national talking points.
[37:02.620 --> 37:06.120]  Because even though when he's top rated, on average, he has about half a million viewers,
[37:06.120 --> 37:10.960]  which is a joke. Old CNN had about 10 million just 15 years ago. They're a shadow of what
[37:10.960 --> 37:17.880]  they once were. Even though all of that is happening, they take his talking points and
[37:17.880 --> 37:25.280]  put it on Jay Leno and every other show, every other comedy show, Conan O'Brien, The Daily
[37:25.280 --> 37:32.600]  Show, CNN airs it on all their shows, Fox, MSNBC, that's why it's big.
[37:32.600 --> 37:36.600]  And when I ran into Piers Morgan, we're gonna play a clip of this in a moment. When I ran
[37:36.600 --> 37:43.440]  into Piers Morgan, he said, yes, you like the fame you've gotten. I mean, I have 3 million
[37:43.440 --> 37:48.040]  listeners a day conservatively, 15 million watcherless in one way or another a week.
[37:48.040 --> 37:51.760]  But I don't wear a crown and have a big entourage and all this. I guess I should, that gets
[37:51.760 --> 37:56.240]  people to pay attention. But here's Piers Morgan with his giant crew and satellite trucks
[37:56.240 --> 38:03.360]  and 15 people there with him standing around and in booms and $300,000 cameras. It's the
[38:03.360 --> 38:06.640]  Emperor's new clothes.
[38:06.640 --> 38:11.480]  And I had said that if they let me backstage with him to surprise him, I would be friendly.
[38:11.480 --> 38:15.200]  Well, it turned out that he'd actually read my article I'd put out on Infowars. He says,
[38:15.200 --> 38:19.020]  well, you just said you wanted to shake my hand to be friendly. But he was there dropping
[38:19.020 --> 38:25.980]  comments like, the fame you've gotten, from me, my ears are still ringing and all this.
[38:25.980 --> 38:32.600]  So I hit back with, okay, Piers, why don't you have me back for another debate? Why don't
[38:32.600 --> 38:39.140]  you have me back on because, you know I cleaned your clock. You know you got record ratings,
[38:39.140 --> 38:44.000]  but you know it actually woke people out of their trance, and that's the issue.
[38:44.000 --> 38:48.840]  Piers Morgan has admitted they're losing. Forbes has major data mining companies hired,
[38:48.840 --> 38:52.660]  NRA winning the influence battle over gun control, that this has actually backfired
[38:52.660 --> 38:57.560]  on them. So suddenly Obama is out there with the shotgun shooting to give everybody the
[38:57.560 --> 39:00.680]  image of, hey, I don't wanna take your guns. Remember the clip four years ago?
[39:00.680 --> 39:07.300]  I'm not coming for your rifle, your shotgun, anything. Remember that? And now it's Piers
[39:07.300 --> 39:11.300]  Morgan going, I'm down here in Texas. I'm being friendly. I'm shooting the guns. I'm
[39:11.300 --> 39:17.200]  a nice guy. Come on. I just wanna reasonably register you. And then he implied all these
[39:17.200 --> 39:19.760]  full auto military weapons the citizens could buy them.
[39:19.760 --> 39:23.480]  And no matter how many times the owner explained to him, the public can't get these unless
[39:23.480 --> 39:30.080]  a six month background deal and tax stamp and $5,000 bare minimum and really no crimes
[39:30.080 --> 39:33.960]  are committed with them. And Piers shot all over the ceiling when he shot full auto. Full
[39:33.960 --> 39:37.440]  auto is almost worthless unless it's on a big tripod, in my humble opinion. We're gonna
[39:37.440 --> 39:39.200]  go to our guest.
[39:39.200 --> 39:43.920]  But this is the reason we're engaging this guy. We went down there and took over all
[39:43.920 --> 39:48.880]  the local news, the dozens of national newspaper articles about this. We're now in there with
[39:48.880 --> 39:55.400]  our quotes saying, go look it up, saying he's losing his gun grabber debate. Everywhere
[39:55.400 --> 39:58.840]  the gun controllers get control, they take all the guns. This is disingenuous.
[39:58.840 --> 40:02.480]  They're not saying let's be reasonable for the kids. They are exploiting their deaths
[40:02.480 --> 40:06.480]  and he's bragged that he stands on top of their graves and is using them. He's that
[40:06.480 --> 40:12.300]  arrogant. And Piers Morgan is not a good seller of gun control, but that shows how arrogant
[40:12.300 --> 40:16.160]  the globalist are to send a foreigner over here a red coat.
[40:16.160 --> 40:20.680]  Not cuz he's British, but because he's anti-gun from Britain coming to America to take our
[40:20.680 --> 40:26.140]  guns. That's 1776 red coat. Even Ted Nugent said you were the best poster boy against
[40:26.140 --> 40:30.920]  gun control. It's true. It blew up in their face. They failed. So they're declaring victory
[40:30.920 --> 40:32.600]  cuz I went and blew up on them.
[40:32.600 --> 40:36.480]  That's what we need is to get people out of their trance, to wake America up. Paul Revere
[40:36.480 --> 40:41.760]  said to arms to arms screaming, let's kill people. I'm not screaming, let's kill people.
[40:41.760 --> 40:45.480]  I'm saying the opposite. Let's get politically involved and take America back. What would
[40:45.480 --> 40:49.120]  an average so-called conservative do today if Paul Revere showed up saying to arms to
[40:49.120 --> 40:51.600]  arms that come up with the guns, let's start shooting?
[40:51.600 --> 40:56.040]  They would go and arrest them. They would go and kill Paul Revere. The average conservative
[40:56.040 --> 41:00.080]  would shoot them out the top of their window. If you can't handle me yelling at somebody,
[41:00.080 --> 41:05.080]  you've got a problem. And we're gonna go to tactical response owner, talk about his amazing
[41:05.080 --> 41:06.080]  tactical firearms.
[41:06.080 --> 41:12.520]  We're gonna go to him here in just a moment. But first, I wanted to play the clip. And
[41:12.520 --> 41:16.640]  again, I walk in, I thought I was gonna meet with the owner first. They walk me in and
[41:16.640 --> 41:21.600]  it's Piers Morgan. He has this shocked look, but I'm shooting on iPhone, didn't catch it.
[41:21.600 --> 41:26.120]  The head of tactical firearms says he's gonna give me the tape of it cuz he has high def
[41:26.120 --> 41:27.920]  in there from his security footage.
[41:27.920 --> 41:34.640]  But he jolts back in fear. We'll get the response from our guest on what he saw in a moment.
[41:34.640 --> 41:40.520]  And I go, hey, I'm just here to be friendly. And I wanted to debate you again. I was sick
[41:40.520 --> 41:46.560]  when I was on your show. Well, you can just hear it from the actual tape. Here it is.
[41:46.560 --> 41:52.840]  Hey, how are you? Good to see you, man. Good to see you. You good? Yeah, I hope you have
[41:52.840 --> 41:57.760]  your back on. I hear you're a big customer here. Oh, no, but some of my listeners already
[41:57.760 --> 42:02.960]  say it's the best around here. Yeah. You good at enjoying global fame? Oh, well, I already
[42:02.960 --> 42:06.160]  had quite a few listeners, but no, it certainly went viral. Yeah. That's why we should do
[42:06.160 --> 42:11.820]  another interview. You like it? And my ears haven't recovered yet. They what? My ears
[42:11.820 --> 42:15.680]  haven't recovered. Well, it was good that I had a fever and was actually sick. That's
[42:15.680 --> 42:20.320]  why I was sweating. I mean, I almost didn't come because of that, but I said I'd do it.
[42:20.320 --> 42:23.380]  That's kind of why I got that. I didn't blow up on purpose, but I thought it turned out
[42:23.380 --> 42:30.320]  as good for people thinking about the debate. No problem with that. Are you guys going live
[42:30.320 --> 42:35.160]  tonight? Most of it. Yeah. A couple of prerecords, but most of it's like, are you going to have
[42:35.160 --> 42:41.320]  me back on? I don't want to promote you that much. Exactly. But I thought you won the debate
[42:41.320 --> 42:44.040]  though. You were saying it was the best interview ever. You said on your Twitter, you wanted
[42:44.040 --> 42:48.680]  to shake my hand and have a civilized conversation. Here we are. All right. Good to see you again.
[42:48.680 --> 42:51.560]  You just had a civilized conversation. I've had very civilized conversations in Texas
[42:51.560 --> 42:54.400]  since I've been here. All right, well good. We'll see. We just had a friendly talk right
[42:54.400 --> 42:57.160]  there. Good to see you again. All right. Good seeing you. Good luck with the show. Good
[42:57.160 --> 43:04.120]  to see you guys. Okay. So how about we do this? Since we're going to be shooting, do
[43:04.120 --> 43:07.320]  you mind if these guys are going to be moving around a lot? If we're not part of the segment,
[43:07.320 --> 43:12.440]  we're going to be clear. Yeah, I'll just step right back here. It's totally fine. Not during
[43:12.440 --> 43:21.000]  the segment though. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well, that's fine. It's just the owner told me that
[43:21.000 --> 43:30.360]  I thought you guys are live tonight. We just do this after. Yeah. Are you a CNN guy? Oh,
[43:30.360 --> 43:33.160]  that's what I thought. Where's Jeremy, the owner. He was real nice. I talked to him on
[43:33.160 --> 43:40.160]  the phone. Okay, great. Well, go ahead. Go ahead. This is okay. I understand. This is
[43:40.160 --> 43:44.560]  like Obama shooting the shotgun. Now you're going to make everybody think you're pro gun.
[43:44.560 --> 43:51.000]  Thank you much. Because you lost the debate. I won. You're scared to have me back off here.
[43:51.000 --> 43:54.240]  All right. And Jeremy says he's going to get the high def footage of a security system
[43:54.240 --> 43:57.920]  and upload that to YouTube or give it to us so we can see the response of Piers when I
[43:57.920 --> 44:01.160]  walked in. Because I didn't know. I thought I was going to meet with Jeremy, who was then
[44:01.160 --> 44:04.640]  going to let me go surprise Piers Morgan and give him a bottle of water.
[44:04.640 --> 44:09.460]  And as I walk through into the shooting range, there's Piers Morgan. And he took a step back
[44:09.460 --> 44:15.360]  and was like he'd actually walked into his bedroom and seen a vampire or something. But
[44:15.360 --> 44:20.960]  then he recovered quite quickly and I was nice to him. So we did get a chance to actually
[44:20.960 --> 44:24.940]  surprise him. He knew I was coming, but he didn't know I'd be walked right into him.
[44:24.940 --> 44:27.600]  And it turned out the security hadn't even been told to do that. They've been told to
[44:27.600 --> 44:32.200]  take me to a green room. But by the grace of God, they took me right in. And again,
[44:32.200 --> 44:36.480]  we're doing this so he can't just operate on his own so we can engage him in the debate
[44:36.480 --> 44:40.320]  and say, look, you don't want reasonable gun control to really try to protect innocents.
[44:40.320 --> 44:45.300]  You want a list to confiscate as it has been done worldwide in every city you control.
[44:45.300 --> 44:51.640]  Now Jeremy Allseed joins us and he is the owner and founder of Tactical Firearms, a
[44:51.640 --> 44:56.680]  very interesting individual. And of course, he just had that big show last night with
[44:56.680 --> 45:03.280]  Piers Morgan that's made national news again because of our protest outside and what happened.
[45:03.280 --> 45:08.120]  And again, at first, I thought that they were pro Piers Morgan because of this info put
[45:08.120 --> 45:12.440]  out by the media. So I was going down there to protest. Instead, they let us in until
[45:12.440 --> 45:16.860]  CNN freaked out and asked us to go. And it was just amazing. So Jeremy, great to have
[45:16.860 --> 45:17.860]  you on with us.
[45:17.860 --> 45:22.040]  Thank you for having me. OK, well, so much has happened. We did a taped interview yesterday
[45:22.040 --> 45:25.440]  that we're going to air tonight on the nightly news. We were very eloquent and broke down
[45:25.440 --> 45:29.160]  stuff for about 30 minutes. But out of the gates, what do you think of what happened
[45:29.160 --> 45:30.160]  last night?
[45:30.160 --> 45:35.480]  I was really disappointed. You know, I take people for their word, just like you gave
[45:35.480 --> 45:39.680]  me your word and you kept it. You know, I give everybody that opportunity. And they
[45:39.680 --> 45:47.100]  told me it was going to be a live live TV show and over half of it was taped. And so
[45:47.100 --> 45:51.320]  the tape part, of course, was all edited. I didn't get any of my points across. They
[45:51.320 --> 45:55.680]  told me that just because it was taped, that they were going to leave it unedited. The
[45:55.680 --> 46:00.200]  whole twenty five, 30 minute interview we did was unbelievable. And they said, we're
[46:00.200 --> 46:03.320]  even bumping a couple of things to put it in there. And I was all excited. And then
[46:03.320 --> 46:07.240]  I get home and I watch it. And, you know, they made me sound like an idiot. I said,
[46:07.240 --> 46:08.240]  what the heck?
[46:08.240 --> 46:13.480]  So I talked to my people this morning. They're pulling all the footage from the entire building,
[46:13.480 --> 46:20.920]  front back house, every outside. And we're going to make our own maybe hour or two segment
[46:20.920 --> 46:23.600]  and we're going to make it go viral with your help.
[46:23.600 --> 46:26.920]  Absolutely. And I, you know, I told you on the phone driving up there when you were trying
[46:26.920 --> 46:29.400]  to get a hold of Mike Adams and I got a hold of you because you were kind enough to reach
[46:29.400 --> 46:32.760]  out and say, I love it when you answer the phone and I called you back. You go friendly
[46:32.760 --> 46:34.320]  fire, friendly fire.
[46:34.320 --> 46:39.720]  That was hilarious. We're on the same team. I'm like, man, I'm getting all these emails.
[46:39.720 --> 46:43.920]  I literally got two hundred something emails in 30 seconds from all your listeners. And
[46:43.920 --> 46:48.720]  they're like, you know, you communist bastard. And I'm like, whoa, what are you talking about?
[46:48.720 --> 46:49.920]  That's not me.
[46:49.920 --> 46:55.240]  They said, Alex Jones says it was you. And I said, have him call me right now. So I called,
[46:55.240 --> 46:59.520]  you know, Mike. We've been friends for years. And I said, Mike, man, what's your boy doing
[46:59.520 --> 47:01.040]  over there? Throw me under the bus.
[47:01.040 --> 47:05.240]  Well, you've got a great company. And I certainly wish it was closer to Austin. But I may travel
[47:05.240 --> 47:09.680]  down there to do some shooting, just an absolutely amazing facility. But expanding on this, I
[47:09.680 --> 47:13.480]  warned you, I said, they're going to end up taping. I said, let me guess on the phone
[47:13.480 --> 47:14.480]  driving into Houston.
[47:14.480 --> 47:18.720]  I said, let me guess. They're telling you they want to just shoot some some intro video
[47:18.720 --> 47:22.080]  in here. Yeah, yeah. But they say most of it's live. And I said, no, they're going to
[47:22.080 --> 47:25.440]  make you look like an idiot. You go, well, great. I've got all the surveillance and high
[47:25.440 --> 47:28.720]  def and audio and we'll just put something out.
[47:28.720 --> 47:33.440]  So this is the deal. I'd love if you need. In fact, if you want to give us the raw footage,
[47:33.440 --> 47:37.440]  you can approve our edit of it, you know, to make it go more virally about 15 minutes
[47:37.440 --> 47:41.640]  and we'll show your interview what you really said. And that's the way to counter CNN. I've
[47:41.640 --> 47:45.940]  actually done that before, taped them in an interview and showed what I really said versus
[47:45.940 --> 47:49.960]  what they said. And they misrepresented you. They they lied to you. And you have every
[47:49.960 --> 47:52.400]  right, I think, to expose them.
[47:52.400 --> 47:58.760]  I agree. And I'll never have them back. Of course, I'd love to have you back. Go do some
[47:58.760 --> 48:04.120]  helicopter hog hunts, full auto style. It's going to be fun. But, you know, I gave him
[48:04.120 --> 48:08.320]  a chance. I wanted to be a Texan. I want to be a Christian and, you know, open up my doors
[48:08.320 --> 48:11.640]  and try to show them the air of their ways.
[48:11.640 --> 48:15.160]  And because they said they want to be educated, they wanted to learn about guns because he
[48:15.160 --> 48:20.400]  hasn't handled a gun over 10 years. And so I took that as an opportunity to, you know,
[48:20.400 --> 48:24.600]  maybe show them that, you know, just because you don't understand guns doesn't mean you
[48:24.600 --> 48:31.560]  have to be scared of guns. And I let him shoot, you know, thousands of dollars worth of ammo
[48:31.560 --> 48:38.880]  all the way from a 22 to a 50 BMG, Uzis, MP5s, Chris 45s, you name it. And the only thing
[48:38.880 --> 48:44.960]  they fixated on was a stupid AR-15. And then, of course, the Mardus, you know, saying, well,
[48:44.960 --> 48:49.240]  who needs one of these? And, you know, I've got a lot of high end customers that purchase
[48:49.240 --> 48:50.920]  these weapons as investments.
[48:50.920 --> 48:57.840]  You never hear about a crime being committed with a Mardus. What are you doing? Shooting
[48:57.840 --> 49:04.440]  Godzilla at thirty to thirty six hundred dollars a minute. Most people, you know, even the
[49:04.440 --> 49:08.840]  wealthy can't afford just to, you know, let those things fly full auto. So.
[49:08.840 --> 49:14.080]  Unbelievable. Well, I want to break down more of what happened, but this is the issue with
[49:14.080 --> 49:17.840]  mainstream corporate media and why I blew up at Piers Morgan. They lied to me and said,
[49:17.840 --> 49:20.160]  we're not going to have victims families on right before you come on, even though I've
[49:20.160 --> 49:21.560]  been told by internal sources.
[49:21.560 --> 49:26.400]  Sure enough, they did. They got in my face. They made sniveling comments. And I'm and
[49:26.400 --> 49:30.360]  I don't want them to know I know you're liars. And that's why I told you I said, no, if you
[49:30.360 --> 49:34.480]  let me go in and talk to him and surprise him, I'll be polite and shake his hand. And
[49:34.480 --> 49:38.080]  I did what I said I do. And you notice they lied to you.
[49:38.080 --> 49:43.600]  Then they always lie. That's what I'm saying. These are liars, right? I understand now.
[49:43.600 --> 49:48.000]  I had to give him a chance. I just had to apologize for all my customers that, you know,
[49:48.000 --> 49:52.400]  feel disappointed because I let them into the door. It's just if we back down from our
[49:52.400 --> 49:58.960]  enemies and our foes that, you know, we we have no chance to express how we feel.
[49:58.960 --> 50:07.160]  Well, listen, you've absolutely got to release as soon as you can. You know, your real interview
[50:07.160 --> 50:10.560]  with him and what was really sad. And then we could cut it in if you want, because I've
[50:10.560 --> 50:15.800]  got an expert crew cut into CNN and it's all fair use to document what they did and show
[50:15.800 --> 50:17.760]  how they twisted it.
[50:17.760 --> 50:22.900]  What message did you really want to get across? Because, again, this has three million listeners.
[50:22.900 --> 50:27.840]  He has half a million. He is huge when he goes viral, but he only goes viral when he
[50:27.840 --> 50:32.680]  gets constitutionalist libertarians and conservatives on. That's why he's getting people on because
[50:32.680 --> 50:33.680]  he needs our audience.
[50:33.680 --> 50:38.480]  He even said, I don't care if you hate me, just watch. So he now has a bigger audience
[50:38.480 --> 50:41.800]  than he's ever had of people that hate him. I mean, can you imagine that?
[50:41.800 --> 50:46.120]  Right. Well, you can go back and look at the video and you can see one minute I'm wearing
[50:46.120 --> 50:50.440]  glasses, one minute glasses and hearing protection. Next minute, just hearing protection. And
[50:50.440 --> 50:54.800]  I mean, you can see that it's all, you know, clipped and put together. One of the big things
[50:54.800 --> 50:56.460]  that, you know, I don't have all the answers.
[50:56.460 --> 51:01.040]  I don't claim to be a spokesperson. I don't have the statistics. But the one thing that
[51:01.040 --> 51:05.880]  I do know is if you look at all the mass shootings, they all happen in places where concealed
[51:05.880 --> 51:10.320]  care were not allowed. And so I don't have the answer to fix all the problems. You can't
[51:10.320 --> 51:13.800]  ever fix all the problems. There's going to be crazy with or without guns.
[51:13.800 --> 51:17.680]  Yeah, humans aren't perfect. There's always going to be crazy. He's always had men, always
[51:17.680 --> 51:20.960]  will be. But the only answer is good people protect ourselves.
[51:20.960 --> 51:25.720]  Right. And these people are, you know, they're into self-preservation. They don't want to
[51:25.720 --> 51:31.120]  die, but they want to go kill people and they're cowards. And so they look for a target rich
[51:31.120 --> 51:37.040]  environment. And if you were given door A and door B and you're the bad guy and you
[51:37.040 --> 51:41.960]  want to go kill people and behind door A, you're guaranteed, there's going to be nobody
[51:41.960 --> 51:46.260]  that's armed and nobody's shooting back and you've got door B and door B there could or
[51:46.260 --> 51:48.360]  could not be people shooting back.
[51:48.360 --> 51:53.680]  Which door is the bad guy? Are you going to choose door A? So we need to eliminate door
[51:53.680 --> 51:57.400]  A. So I'm going to make some t-shirts that say, eliminate Dory. I think that's the first
[51:57.400 --> 52:02.680]  step. We need to allow concealed carry into movie theaters and malls and arenas. And,
[52:02.680 --> 52:07.960]  you know, so then the it's brought up. Well, you know, well, what happens if, you know,
[52:07.960 --> 52:12.120]  one of these CHL people actually shoots another person, you're thinking too far into it.
[52:12.120 --> 52:15.760]  If the bad guys know that there are guns behind the door, they're not going to go in and you're
[52:15.760 --> 52:17.000]  not going to have to use it.
[52:17.000 --> 52:24.800]  Look, FBI crime statistics, 49% drop in violent crime since 1991 because you can watch the
[52:24.800 --> 52:31.240]  graph of crime going down as gun ownership goes up. I mean, they know this. Again, we
[52:31.240 --> 52:35.740]  try to argue with them with facts. They're authoritarians, they've got bodyguards. Piers
[52:35.740 --> 52:39.080]  Morgan makes like $8 million a year.
[52:39.080 --> 52:48.640]  He knows, okay? He knows he had his security. He knows it's about elitism and they are afraid
[52:48.640 --> 52:52.380]  of the armed society because they want the monopoly of control. What else did you say
[52:52.380 --> 52:55.520]  to Piers Morgan that ended up getting twisted and cut out?
[52:55.520 --> 53:00.480]  Well, one of the things when he was talking about home protection, I told him that a shotgun
[53:00.480 --> 53:04.760]  is excellent for home protection because it dissipates more where a pistol or rifle round
[53:04.760 --> 53:13.000]  doesn't deform as it goes through the sheetrock. And I've seen, you know, 556, 223, 9 millimeter
[53:13.000 --> 53:19.800]  go through four or five walls, which are eight layers of gypsum and still have lethality
[53:19.800 --> 53:24.680]  where a shotgun, you know, after going through one wall, it definitely doesn't have enough
[53:24.680 --> 53:28.680]  to go through two walls, four sheets of sheetrock through two walls.
[53:28.680 --> 53:29.680]  Flangeable.
[53:29.680 --> 53:36.780]  Right. And you know, the whole point is the, you know, the lead shot, you know, the energy
[53:36.780 --> 53:42.240]  stopped by the sheetrock where a pistol or rifle round is not. And so in my 19 years
[53:42.240 --> 53:46.320]  in military law enforcement, I've learned that that's why shotguns are the best for
[53:46.320 --> 53:50.980]  home defense. And because if you shoot a pistol and you miss what you're going to miss.
[53:50.980 --> 53:52.880]  You don't want to kill your kids.
[53:52.880 --> 53:56.000]  You don't want to kill, exactly. Or your neighbors, you don't want to go through two walls and
[53:56.000 --> 54:01.840]  a window. And so you're responsible for every round that leaves. Well, I said, you know,
[54:01.840 --> 54:08.760]  even if you miss or you can't miss and, you know, talked about because this is the round
[54:08.760 --> 54:13.680]  used because of the, you know, energy absorption, they cut that out. So the only thing that
[54:13.680 --> 54:17.560]  I think it caught me saying was you can't miss with a shotgun.
[54:17.560 --> 54:21.560]  And I'm like, well, what do you mean you can't miss it? So I got slammed. People said, well,
[54:21.560 --> 54:23.120]  you can't miss the shotgun. What are you talking about?
[54:23.120 --> 54:26.840]  They make you sound like a total idiot. And it sounds like you're saying, yeah, you shoot
[54:26.840 --> 54:30.320]  guns and kill your neighbors, but you can't miss with a shotgun. It sounds like crazy
[54:30.320 --> 54:31.320]  babble.
[54:31.320 --> 54:35.120]  Right. And you know, that's what happens when you have 30, 40 minutes of taping and they
[54:35.120 --> 54:36.320]  show 11 minutes of it.
[54:36.320 --> 54:41.240]  You know, one reason I blew up at Morgan tube is that I'm in there about 10 minutes before
[54:41.240 --> 54:45.440]  we go live sitting there with him. He's looking at me, looking at me real coldly. And they're
[54:45.440 --> 54:49.840]  like, yeah, look, he's not wearing a jacket. Move him out front. Yeah. Look at the belly.
[54:49.840 --> 54:54.200]  And I hear him. And so they move us out. Okay. Alex with his tucked in shirt is a little
[54:54.200 --> 54:58.440]  bit of a pot belly. And, and, and I mean, literally I hear them whispering how to make
[54:58.440 --> 54:59.440]  me look bad.
[54:59.440 --> 55:04.520]  And it's just like, you're a bunch of cockroaches and I'm sick of it. And I see you and I know
[55:04.520 --> 55:05.520]  what you are.
[55:05.520 --> 55:10.840]  Yeah. You're going to love the security footage. You know, when you had left the room, they
[55:10.840 --> 55:16.720]  said, Oh, we can't allow him to ruin our, our, our show. And, you know, and I said,
[55:16.720 --> 55:20.600]  you know what, he's got freedom of speech. He can say whatever he wants. So, you know,
[55:20.600 --> 55:25.440]  I applaud you for coming out and I'm glad the truth is going to be known.
[55:25.440 --> 55:30.560]  Tell us a little bit about yourself. Cause you've got quite a, quite a history in training
[55:30.560 --> 55:32.800]  and things as well, be able to speak about the second amendment.
[55:32.800 --> 55:37.760]  Yeah. It's, you know, I've always been a advocate of guns. I grew up in a military
[55:37.760 --> 55:42.440]  law enforcement family. I've been military law enforcement since I got out of high school.
[55:42.440 --> 55:46.880]  It's just, it's something that I'm passionate about. I was blessed enough to be able to
[55:46.880 --> 55:52.200]  retire from the stock market and not have to do a nine to five job. I shopped at the
[55:52.200 --> 55:57.600]  stores here in Houston when I moved here and I was just upset that either guy, you know,
[55:57.600 --> 56:01.840]  crazy high prices over retail, or you go into another place and they're rude, or you go
[56:01.840 --> 56:05.960]  another place and they don't know the difference between a 380 and a 38. And just over three
[56:05.960 --> 56:10.760]  years ago, I woke up at three o'clock in the morning with the dream that I had a gun store
[56:10.760 --> 56:17.600]  with a range and it was the nicest range in the U S just smoked everything. And then we
[56:17.600 --> 56:22.320]  had three principles and that was guaranteed lowest prices, best customer service and best
[56:22.320 --> 56:28.000]  knowledge in the business. And so I just moved forward with that dream. And here we are now,
[56:28.000 --> 56:31.440]  you know, we're doing, well, normally we do about a million dollars a month and it's been
[56:31.440 --> 56:35.940]  pretty crazy here because of the surge, but now we're sold out and we're not making anything.
[56:35.940 --> 56:38.920]  But that's not the point. And the point is just take care of our customers and they'll
[56:38.920 --> 56:42.860]  take care of you and enjoy what we do. Well, the good news is you told me you're going
[56:42.860 --> 56:46.800]  to be building something there. Austin. We are actually what we're doing right now. We
[56:46.800 --> 56:50.100]  bought the land next door. We're going to be doing an indoor trap, skeet and sporting
[56:50.100 --> 56:59.000]  clays facility. I like that indoor a hundred yard range, a full manufacturing 50 more pistol.
[56:59.000 --> 57:01.800]  We've talked to the owners of twin peaks. They're interested in putting the restaurant
[57:01.800 --> 57:08.480]  in our facility, child care. So it's going to be a 10 story Mecca of just come and do
[57:08.480 --> 57:14.340]  it all a one stop shop. And it's about $25 million. But at that point it would be the
[57:14.340 --> 57:18.400]  nicest facility in the world. Right now we've got the nicest, most advanced shooting range
[57:18.400 --> 57:22.320]  in the U S and it will be the nice in the world when this comes online. As soon as that's
[57:22.320 --> 57:27.440]  done, then we're going to move to the woodlands in Dallas and the Austin San Antonio area
[57:27.440 --> 57:31.320]  or somewhere in between. So instead of having the giant pro bash shops that look like huge
[57:31.320 --> 57:38.280]  mother ships that have landed, we're going to have huge mega, mega complexes with you
[57:38.280 --> 57:41.720]  heading it up beautiful because we need wealth and we need success.
[57:41.720 --> 57:45.840]  We need an economy and this is a beachhead against tyranny. That's why they're panicking
[57:45.840 --> 57:50.280]  so bad. We're about to go to break them to five more minutes with you, an amazing interview.
[57:50.280 --> 57:53.240]  But tell me what else did they say behind the scenes that we're going to be seeing on
[57:53.240 --> 57:58.960]  these videos? Well, it's, I couldn't really understand much. Hopefully the camera, since
[57:58.960 --> 58:03.120]  I have 130 high definition cameras with audio and video picked up more than I could because
[58:03.120 --> 58:06.480]  every time they wanted to talk, you know, they would go off in the corner and whisper
[58:06.480 --> 58:11.120]  in their little earpiece and stuff. And, um, I just know things kept changing. They said
[58:11.120 --> 58:14.360]  it was going to be live. And then they said, Oh, well this changed. Oh, well this changed.
[58:14.360 --> 58:18.520]  Oh, but it's not edited. It's all raw footage. And Oh, but this changed. And the whole thing
[58:18.520 --> 58:23.920]  was a lie. And so, you know, you can't trust a word that they say. Well, no, they're there
[58:23.920 --> 58:28.920]  the whole time. Angling how to hurt you, angling how to, they're there to deceive people and
[58:28.920 --> 58:33.160]  go, we're just reasonable. Look, Obama's shooting a shotgun. We're not going to take
[58:33.160 --> 58:37.440]  your guns. We just got a bunch of bills introduced to do it. We're your friends. Don't run. We

[59:53.480 --> 01:00:05.240]  Raging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:12.320]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover ups. You want answers? Well so does
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:29.800]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:35.800]  Well I've got to get Jeremy Alseed back on the broadcast for a full hour because what
[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:41.700]  an American success story. A veteran invests in the stock market, makes money, starts a
[01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:49.280]  gun shop, gun range, becomes incredibly successful. Now expanding, about to go all over Texas.
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:55.200]  That's how it happens. It's like the Bucky's truck stops that are getting so popular, started
[01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:59.960]  by one of Ron Paul's friends. You've got constitutions and come and take it signs hanging up all
[01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:04.480]  over the place. I mean, this is how we're going to take over is taking over the culture.
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:08.760]  People want to support patriots and we've got to support them. And I think it's important
[01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:14.680]  for folks to go to tacticalfirearms.us and absolutely check out what they're doing in
[01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:18.920]  anybody in South Texas or if you're coming through Houston, you got to go to Katie and
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:19.920]  check it out.
[01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:24.960]  Their address is up there. You can also give them a call, 281-693-GUNS. It's at 1200 S.
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:33.040]  Mason Road, Katie, Texas 77450. And in closing here, we only got about three minutes left
[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:37.920]  in this segment. I've thrown a lot of stuff out there, Jeremy. Once you leave here, what
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:42.240]  is it that you wish you would have said? Other key points you'd like to add?
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:49.120]  Well, it's just the point that Ted Nugent made, which I'm glad they didn't edit him.
[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:56.600]  They tried to make him shut up, but he's got a pretty loud voice and guns don't kill people.
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:01.880]  Everybody knows I'm preaching to the choir here. Everybody knows that it's the couple
[01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:06.840]  of crazies that make us all look bad and we just need to stick together and spread the
[01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:10.400]  word and let people know that we're not going to back down at all. We can't give them an
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:15.480]  inch because they'll take a mile. If this is the case, then we need to start throwing
[01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:19.320]  back at them. I know this is going to upset people. We need to start banning alcohol and
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:25.640]  spoons because of obesity and pencils because they cause misspelled words. If they're going
[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:29.920]  to be crazy, what's the answer? Do we get crazy? I don't know the answer. I'm just sick
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:34.320]  and tired of these people coming after what I fought for my country to preserve, and that's
[01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:38.920]  the right to bear arms, amongst all the rest of the rights. Let's just go ahead and get
[01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:43.040]  rid of the Fourth Amendment too. Have some illegal search and seizures, and then let's
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:48.840]  go ahead and trim a little fat off the first. You can only talk on Monday, Wednesday, or
[01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:52.160]  Friday. Where is he going to get?
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:55.240]  Well said, but unfortunately, he didn't let any of that get on air, but what's really
[01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:57.520]  bad is editing you like he did.
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:02.520]  Right. Yeah. He has to live with himself with that. He's going to meet his maker and I have
[01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:07.280]  a clear conscience. So with help from people and viewers like you, we're going to get the
[01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:11.520]  word out and they're not going to be able to touch us. We're going to prevail.
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:16.240]  Did you have a chance that after he did the few pieces live that most of it taped to say,
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:18.960]  hey, that's not what you said you were going to do or did he scurry off?
[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:23.420]  I came this close from pulling the plug when we were actually in the range because they
[01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:27.000]  said we're going to do a couple of segments and then it turned into a longer piece. And
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.040]  I said, what is the point of shooting all these guns? What's the point of this? You
[01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:33.720]  wanted to learn about guns and you're asking these questions that I feel are going to be
[01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:34.720]  one sided.
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:37.880]  And he said, oh no, no, no. You'll get your point across. We promise. What are your point
[01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:43.160]  of, we promise him. I swear I came this close saying, you know what? Pack it up and leave.
[01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:46.640]  But I said, that's not the Christian thing to do. Let's just see what happens. Give them
[01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:50.520]  a chance. And then sure enough, they ruined it and they'll never get another one.
[01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:54.720]  Do you know why Piers Morgan and the rest of mainstream cable has less listeners than
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:58.400]  a small syndicated radio show? Some of the smaller ones out there, it's because they've
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:02.920]  been caught lying so much. They're not lying in a vacuum anymore. Everybody sees their
[01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:05.920]  butt hanging out the window and they think we don't see it.
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:09.840]  Right. Hanging out my window, I'll shoot it next time.
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:14.660]  All right. Well, listen, I want to get you up for a full hour sometime next week to just
[01:04:14.660 --> 01:04:18.940]  talk about the American success story. And I'm glad Mike Adams called me up to say, look,
[01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:21.160]  that's a baloney media article.
[01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:26.160]  And I apologize that I bought in to what the media was saying. I've got to learn just like
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:29.600]  you said. I can't believe I trusted him. I called you and said, don't trust him, but
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:35.720]  I trusted him. So I apologize for believing them and saying that tactical firearms was
[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:36.720]  a not pro Second Amendment.
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:40.200]  I apologize. That's all right. Thank you, brother. All right. Let me say bye to you
[01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:43.760]  during the break. We've got our next guest coming up with some key news. And then we're
[01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:48.160]  going to continue throughout the broadcast today with your phone calls. But that is the
[01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:54.040]  owner and founder, Jeremy Allseed of Tactical Firearms, Tactical Firearms, U.S. I'm Alex

[01:04:57.600 --> 01:05:06.800]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action. Tyranny is here. The grim future
[01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:13.120]  foretold in 1984 has become reality. It really says that the state is God. The United States
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:18.480]  is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth. This film
[01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:24.000]  conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:28.880]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all
[01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:33.800]  powerful shadow state. Police state four chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic
[01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:39.880]  has fallen. Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship, body scanners,
[01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:45.480]  sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner. It's only
[01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:50.640]  the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan. The police state isn't coming. It's

[01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:05.280]  Looking back on 2012, I know personally I'm thanking God that my family and I made it
[01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:09.240]  through the year from natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer
[01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:13.480]  drought to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy. Our hearts go out
[01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:17.560]  to those that have lost everything. My friends at E Foods Direct hear from customers every
[01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:21.800]  day that are fortunate to weather life's storm by having a supply of food on hand. Danny
[01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:26.280]  from New York City wrote in following Hurricane Sandy and said almost all the grocery stores
[01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:30.360]  are closed, but I managed to get my E Foods just in time to be able to help my sister
[01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:34.480]  and my niece. Bottom line, it's better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day
[01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:35.480]  too late.

[01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:05.640]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our

[01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:34.960]  gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents which quickly evaporate and leave the silver

[01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:45.560]  chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the

[01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:12.400]  Big brother. Mainstream media. Government cover ups. You want answers? Well so does
[01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:38.800]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:43.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to have open phones in the third hour and a giant
[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:52.160]  news blitz of information concerning the incredible design implosion of the economy that is accelerating
[01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:57.400]  what Obamacare means as people discover it's all these taxes on the poorest Americans just
[01:08:57.400 --> 01:08:59.680]  incredibly draconian.
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:06.140]  We're also going to get to the fact that active duty Marines have contacted us and Watson
[01:09:06.140 --> 01:09:11.440]  should have the article out. In fact, it just went up at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:16.360]  We're talking photos of the reported shooter that nobody's released. This is an exclusive
[01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:22.480]  and I forgot to call Watson and tell him to put infowars.com on the photo of the supposed
[01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:24.280]  shooter.
[01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:27.760]  And we've talked to these Marines that actually served with him, were in barracks with him.
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:33.920]  They said the guy was a mechanic and did not have PTSD. So US Marine questions narrative
[01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:42.440]  behind Chris Call murder, doubts alleged killer, Eddie Ray Ruth, suffered PTSD. And Watson
[01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:51.480]  has the photos of the Marine in barracks and we were sent the Marine IDs, everything by
[01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:52.680]  these guys to document it.
[01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:57.520]  And we bring the cell phone in here. I don't know why Watson didn't put the photo in there
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:04.440]  as I just announced. There it is, unpublished photo. He has it pop open that way. All right,
[01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:09.080]  hey, that's fine. But CNN and all the rest of these scallywags, not that I want the credit,
[01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:15.320]  but I'm sick of them stealing our stuff and not giving us credit when we give them credit.
[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:19.440]  Get me Kurt Nemo in here real quick. And then we're gonna go to Dr. Peter Glidden here with
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:23.720]  some breaking news. I wanna get Watson, I wanna put infowars on that.
[01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:28.480]  That's big news right there. That's the supposed shooter in the Marines, okay? And I want our
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:33.240]  website infowars.com on that. And I told him that this morning. I'm not mad, I'm just going
[01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:37.760]  crazy here. It's like am I talking in a vacuum? Will you call Watson and will you tell him
[01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:41.960]  to put infowars.com on that unpublished photo, but also don't just have it linked, post it
[01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:42.960]  in the article.
[01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:47.280]  Okay, I mean, that's us breaking the reported shooter in the Marines. There's no photos
[01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:51.760]  of him. That is big national news right there. I mean, my God, it's like we got the boat
[01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:56.720]  tied up to the dock here with the engines going at 500 horsepower tied up to the dock
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:59.040]  and I'm pulling the dock down the lake here.
[01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:05.600]  Cut the rope, man, boom, infowars, let's go. Incredible crew doing a great job, but I'll
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:08.800]  just call Watson right now on air. I mean, this is just real radio, folks. I'm working
[01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:13.160]  so hard. I got home at 2.30 last night. This is just total transparency. I don't have time
[01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:14.960]  to do this editor job here.
[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:19.720]  And by the way, I'm killing myself doing this. I'm gonna take a week off here soon and just
[01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:23.320]  get back in the gym and everything cuz I mean, I'm just burning the candle at all 15 ends
[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:30.920]  here. Amazing, but anyways, this is big breaking news that we've got right here. More like
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:33.080]  a football coach and a rampage on the sidelines.
[01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:37.320]  Hey, Watson, this is an exclusive photo. I want you to add infowars.com to it and I want
[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:43.920]  you to post it embedded in the article, okay? Will you do that for me? When we get an exclusive
[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:49.040]  big national story and we're being given this by the Marine that took it, we need to put-
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:54.800]  All right, listen, I'll call you back. Listen, I'll call you back during the break, okay?
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:12:00.320]  Holy Toledo. All right, yeah, that's him. That's him right there. All right, Watson's
[01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:04.200]  doing a great job. I mean, my crew's doing an awesome job. It's just that this is the
[01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:06.400]  stuff that goes on 24 seven around here.
[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:10.880]  All right, I'm gonna settle down. This is real radio. This isn't talking points. This
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:18.360]  isn't people scripting things. This isn't fake people up there acting like big shots,
[01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:23.640]  ladies and gentlemen. This is the real deal. This is real radio. Somebody focused on liberty,
[01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:25.880]  angry about the New World Order, taking action.
[01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:32.560]  All right, for the rest of the hour, we are joined by syndicated radio host and, of course,
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:39.200]  a doctor. And he is on the broadcast with us here, joining us from his office, Dr. Peter
[01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:44.440]  Glidden. And I wanted to get him on to talk about 780,000 people are killed each year
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:49.960]  from MD treatments. That's conservative. At least 31 school shootings have been on the
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:51.160]  psychotropic type stuff.
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:56.400]  We're gonna get into all that and a bunch of other statistics that are hard numbers
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:13:02.440]  that we need to talk about here today. But I wanted to get Dr. Glidden on first to talk
[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:09.040]  about several new big announcements that just show the total twilight zone level that we're
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:10.040]  in.
[01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:16.640]  This is a scam shot here for TV viewers. Harvard study confirms fluoride reduces children's
[01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:23.520]  IQ, okay? Now, this came out last year, but now there's another report in the Huffington
[01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:29.040]  Post about this, who's called me a conspiracy theorist, talking about this in the past.
[01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:37.760]  And Harvard study confirms fluoride reduces children's IQ and causes cancer, all the rest
[01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:42.840]  of it. And they looked at 27 studies over 22 years by governments and scientific institutions.
[01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:46.480]  Yeah, that's why they put it in the water. John P. Holdren talks about it in his book,
[01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:49.240]  it's to dumb you down and reduce your fertility, okay?
[01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:54.200]  Now, here's another one, government to dispose of radioactive waste by putting it in silverware.
[01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:59.040]  Wall Street Journal and others reporting on this. Let me give you the bibliography here
[01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:10.880]  where it breaks all this down. Again, EPA, FDA, AP, Bloomberg, I love these Washington
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:11.880]  blog articles.
[01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:17.440]  It's just overkill documentation, congressional reports. And they now wanna take scores of
[01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:23.000]  different types of radioactive isotopes, highly radioactive shielding from reactors and put
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:29.400]  it in silverware and put it in prosthesis, everything else. Look, this is being done
[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:32.920]  on purpose. And I know Dr. Glidden's a nice guy and says they're just idiots. And I know
[01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:37.160]  the average MD is compartmentalized, but Dr. Blalock, who's a top MD brain surgeon, he
[01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:40.440]  says it's on purpose and he's gone through the documents.
[01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:44.200]  And again, regardless, these people are killing us. They're worried about poor 20 children
[01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:48.320]  killed and it's sad, but what about the hundreds of thousands of people dying from infections
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:56.760]  every year? So I take you now to Dr. Glidden. He is a naturopathic doctor and host of Fire
[01:14:56.760 --> 01:15:01.200]  Your MD Now. And Dr. Glidden received his BS degree from University of Massachusetts
[01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:02.200]  at Amherst.
[01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:06.360]  He earned his ND from University of Seattle, Washington. He is a member of the American
[01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:11.760]  Association of Naturopathic Physicians and Illinois Association of Naturopathic Physicians.
[01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:16.460]  He's lectured for decades and been all over every TV show you can imagine. And he joins
[01:15:16.460 --> 01:15:22.120]  us at firemdnow.com. His website, our website with all his info is infowarshealth.com.
[01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:27.240]  Okay, Dr. Glidden, you heard me just do that whole rant there. This is just the stuff this
[01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:32.040]  week where it's like, yeah, we're gonna put, the government's gonna approve putting radioactive
[01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:36.360]  isotopes in metal in your tables and in your utensils. It's no big deal.
[01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:40.240]  DU's good for the tribs. Fluoride kills you, but we're gonna put more of it in the water
[01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:45.320]  and we're gonna spray it on the, I mean, what is going on here, Dr. Glidden?
[01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:48.740]  Well, I'm starting to come over to your side of the equation, Alex. You're right that,
[01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:55.760]  you know, in my experience with conventional medicine, until recently, I have been of the
[01:15:55.760 --> 01:16:00.680]  opinion that medical doctors are just compartmentalized in how they're trained and how they're taught.
[01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:04.780]  They're a little bit cowardly because they don't want to step outside of the box of their
[01:16:04.780 --> 01:16:08.740]  conventional medical training. And, you know, it's just like their point of view versus
[01:16:08.740 --> 01:16:13.760]  our point of view. But I got to tell you, man, when I was in medical school in 1987,
[01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:22.640]  I was a freshman in medical school in 1987, I saw a study that was conducted in India,
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:29.780]  which conclusively proved that fluoride reduced IQs. That was 1987. Why has it taken so long
[01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:35.440]  for this stuff to come mainstream now? Well, I'm starting to come around to your way of
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:40.420]  thinking. We are, we have been played, we're continuing to be played. And I got to tell
[01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:45.660]  you, man, this fluoride stuff is the tip of the iceberg.
[01:16:45.660 --> 01:16:53.420]  So where does it go from here? Well, where does it go from here? It goes down and down
[01:16:53.420 --> 01:16:57.360]  and down and down. It's like we're all embedded in that move, the matrix, right? Now, nobody
[01:16:57.360 --> 01:17:02.860]  knows that it's a dream, but it's all a dream. Well, it's not a dream, but nobody, we are,
[01:17:02.860 --> 01:17:09.500]  we have become inculturated to believe that when it comes to our health, our medical doctor,
[01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:14.580]  our MD knows what's best for us. And you know, they must have the best medicine because they're
[01:17:14.580 --> 01:17:20.180]  the king of the hill. They must know what's best for us. But in point of fact, they only
[01:17:20.180 --> 01:17:24.300]  know what they've been trained in and what they've been trained in is one small piece
[01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:30.300]  of the pie of medicine. And the stuff that they have been trained in is not really healthcare.
[01:17:30.300 --> 01:17:36.820]  It's disease management, disease management. And so when you manage illnesses with drugs,
[01:17:36.820 --> 01:17:41.340]  guess what? You don't fix anything. Things get worse. Our life expectancy while we've
[01:17:41.340 --> 01:17:46.780]  let the MDs drive the bus of medicine has gotten less. All chronic diseases have increased.
[01:17:46.780 --> 01:17:51.420]  Alzheimer's has risen from obscurity to the sixth leading cause of death. Autism used
[01:17:51.420 --> 01:17:55.820]  to be one out of 10,000. Now it's one out of 80 or 50, depending on how you crunch the
[01:17:55.820 --> 01:18:00.980]  numbers. Everybody in this country is overweight. Everybody in this country is taking prescription
[01:18:00.980 --> 01:18:06.380]  medicines. Everybody in this country is sick and suffering and poor. And I believe it,
[01:18:06.380 --> 01:18:15.300]  and I think it is an on purpose agenda, which is designed to keep us sick and suffering
[01:18:15.300 --> 01:18:16.300]  and broke.
[01:18:16.300 --> 01:18:21.220]  Well, of course it is. Let's go over some of the statistics here. And again, people
[01:18:21.220 --> 01:18:25.940]  say, oh, statistics. No, I mean FBI crime statistics, very accurate gathered from the
[01:18:25.940 --> 01:18:29.360]  local governments. How many murders there were, it's very clear. How many muggings,
[01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:34.880]  whatever you get reported. But expanding on that, we know how many died in hospitals,
[01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:38.460]  how many died from drug overdoses, how many died from bad drug interactions.
[01:18:38.460 --> 01:18:44.460]  It's on the federal government's own website. It's on the FDA's own website, but it doesn't
[01:18:44.460 --> 01:18:50.580]  get publicized how insanely out of control the medical establishment is. And now it's
[01:18:50.580 --> 01:18:54.260]  becoming this tyranny where they're saying, we're going to make the nurses all take shots.
[01:18:54.260 --> 01:18:58.900]  We're going to make you take shots. Just like in Nazi Germany, it's a medical model being
[01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:00.260]  used to take over.
[01:19:00.260 --> 01:19:05.060]  Well, I mean, it's absolutely correct. It's a medical model is being used to take over.
[01:19:05.060 --> 01:19:09.020]  For goodness sake, the pharmaceutical industry funded the beginning of World War II and right,
[01:19:09.020 --> 01:19:15.100]  the Bayer, which was involved in war crimes of World War II is now selling your kids aspirin.
[01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:23.260]  I mean, it's as completely out of control and, and as crazy as people can, you can consider
[01:19:23.260 --> 01:19:27.680]  just sitting back in your arm chair, reading the newspaper, having a somewhat open mind
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:31.480]  that there's got to be something going on here with the pharmaceutical industry that
[01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:36.580]  man, they are not giving us the straight skinny. Well, I've got to tell you, after 24 years
[01:19:36.580 --> 01:19:42.140]  of clinical experience, it is a million times worse than you think it is.
[01:19:42.140 --> 01:19:48.380]  We're going to come right back and break down some of the latest medical news and how people
[01:19:48.380 --> 01:19:52.540]  are striking back and more attempts to try to restrict just even over the counter vitamins
[01:19:52.540 --> 01:19:57.800]  and minerals, because they know people are discovering at least the treatment if not
[01:19:57.800 --> 01:20:00.860]  the antidote to all the mass poisoning.
[01:20:00.860 --> 01:20:04.980]  Is this the year you finally get serious about your family's drinking water? If so keep listening

[01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:38.660]  won't talk about gold IRAs? They've been available since 1986 yet the financial industry won't
[01:22:38.660 --> 01:22:43.220]  recognize the value of gold for your retirement. Gold is outperformed paper investments yet
[01:22:43.220 --> 01:22:49.820]  no word about IRAs. If you would like to have gold for your retirement call 800-686-2237.

[01:23:01.020 --> 01:23:05.940]  Hey there, Frank Bates here. Have you heard about the weird device that could wipe out
[01:23:05.940 --> 01:23:12.000]  280 million Americans? This is really scary stuff. Defense experts warn that this odd
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:17.300]  device poses the gravest threat we've ever known. In fact, just a few weeks ago former
[01:23:17.300 --> 01:23:21.360]  Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed piece for the Washington Post warning
[01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:26.180]  about this deadly threat. I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this.
[01:23:26.180 --> 01:23:30.900]  It may be because the liberals and the government are trying to cover it up. That's why my friend
[01:23:30.900 --> 01:23:36.980]  just created a free video at weirddevice.com that exposes this threat and blows the doors
[01:23:36.980 --> 01:23:42.660]  off the conspiracy. Go watch the shocking video at weirddevice.com right now to discover
[01:23:42.660 --> 01:23:47.860]  exactly what it is plus discover the number one way you and your family can survive this
[01:23:47.860 --> 01:23:53.100]  deadly attack. I'm not sure how long this video will be online so go to weirddevice.com
[01:23:53.100 --> 01:24:15.900]  before it's gone forever. Again, that's weirddevice.com.
[01:24:15.900 --> 01:24:20.820]  There was a major Clemson University study we're gonna talk about in the next long segment
[01:24:20.820 --> 01:24:26.580]  coming up that is just bombshell info. But really it's not cuz Linus Pauling won the
[01:24:26.580 --> 01:24:31.420]  Nobel Prize or something similar, what, back in the 60s. But we're gonna be looking at
[01:24:31.420 --> 01:24:38.940]  what is old news, rediscovered, redocumented, scientifically, really breaking, earth-shattering
[01:24:38.940 --> 01:24:40.700]  information.
[01:24:40.700 --> 01:24:44.740]  We dropped so many bombshells here, and then later I'm thinking about it and going, man,
[01:24:44.740 --> 01:24:53.100]  I just reported that like it was no big deal. And that's what I just did with this infowars.com,
[01:24:53.100 --> 01:25:00.740]  prisonplanet.com article, where we're talking to active duty Marines who obviously think
[01:25:00.740 --> 01:25:05.980]  Chris Kyle was killed as part of some larger nefarious program.
[01:25:05.980 --> 01:25:11.900]  And there is a purge going on. Author and former intelligence, guys, he punched my computer
[01:25:11.900 --> 01:25:17.420]  up on a show people for watching on TV. And there's a shot of the man with his son, author
[01:25:17.420 --> 01:25:22.660]  and former intelligence contract pilot accused in murder-suicide, and that's how they do
[01:25:22.660 --> 01:25:23.660]  it.
[01:25:23.660 --> 01:25:28.500]  They'll kill you, kill your wife and say that you killed her. That ever happens to me, folks,
[01:25:28.500 --> 01:25:34.260]  it was a setup, okay? Hell would freeze over before I hurt my family. Author and former
[01:25:34.260 --> 01:25:40.180]  intelligence contract pilot accused in murder-suicide. And then here it is, US Marine questions narrative
[01:25:40.180 --> 01:25:43.940]  behind Chris Kyle, most deadly sniper murder.
[01:25:43.940 --> 01:25:54.780]  And this is a big story, folks, up at infowars.com. Doubt's alleged killer, Eddie Ray Roth, suffered
[01:25:54.780 --> 01:26:02.260]  from PTSD. He was a mechanic that they knew and that they were together with and that
[01:26:02.260 --> 01:26:12.500]  never saw any combat. That is big news. That is big news. This thing stinks to eye heaven.
[01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:19.780]  Going back to Dr. Glidden, I wanna go over some of these statistics. Break down the 780,000
[01:26:19.780 --> 01:26:21.260]  people killed each year from MD treatments.
[01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:25.340]  And then let's get into at least 31 of the school shootings and other school related
[01:26:25.340 --> 01:26:30.260]  violent acts have been committed by those taking or withdrawing from psychiatric drugs.
[01:26:30.260 --> 01:26:34.420]  I mean, why aren't they getting blamed instead of the Second Amendment? Let's go over who
[01:26:34.420 --> 01:26:36.380]  the real danger is in this country.
[01:26:36.380 --> 01:26:42.460]  Well, see, this is what happens when an industry is monopolized by something, then whoever
[01:26:42.460 --> 01:26:46.300]  is monopolizing the industry has complete control of the industry. And medicine in the
[01:26:46.300 --> 01:26:51.460]  United States has been completely monopolized by the pharmaceutical industry and the MDs
[01:26:51.460 --> 01:26:53.460]  since the early 1920s.
[01:26:53.460 --> 01:26:58.040]  Most of us weren't even born, you know, weren't even alive then, so we don't remember. This
[01:26:58.040 --> 01:27:03.700]  certainly isn't taught to us in school. And so when you monopolize in any aspect of any
[01:27:03.700 --> 01:27:09.980]  industry, you can get away with murder. And, you know, you pass it off as, oh, it's just
[01:27:09.980 --> 01:27:14.380]  par for the course, it's just collateral damage, and nobody questions it.
[01:27:14.380 --> 01:27:21.100]  The third leading cause of death in the United States is heart disease. The third leading
[01:27:21.100 --> 01:27:25.980]  cause of death is cancer. 550,000 people a year are killed by cancer. Second leading
[01:27:25.980 --> 01:27:31.480]  cause of death is heart disease. 680,000, 690,000 people a year are killed by heart
[01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:39.340]  disease. The leading cause of death, 780,000 people a year are killed because of MD treatments,
[01:27:39.340 --> 01:27:45.020]  and that's a combination of infections that they got in hospitals, side effects from drugs,
[01:27:45.020 --> 01:27:49.600]  and just direct effects of the treatment, like Neil Armstrong, for goodness sake. Neil
[01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:56.060]  Armstrong, you know, went into his doctor for an annual checkup, and they do an angiogram,
[01:27:56.060 --> 01:27:59.660]  they say, well, Neil, there's a little bit of a blockage there in your coronary artery,
[01:27:59.660 --> 01:28:04.820]  and so we think that we need to give you a bypass, just a preventive bypass, and Neil
[01:28:04.820 --> 01:28:10.380]  Armstrong believes them. And so he has the bypass, and they kill him, and they kill him,
[01:28:10.380 --> 01:28:15.140]  and they get a pass. And, you know, there's no outrage, there's no headline stories, it's
[01:28:15.140 --> 01:28:19.580]  no, they did their very best. Well, guess what, they didn't do their very best. Guess
[01:28:19.580 --> 01:28:25.900]  what, when, even though MDs, bless you know, they might be the nicest people in the world,
[01:28:25.900 --> 01:28:30.100]  but their therapeutics consistently failed to fix us, their therapeutics consistently
[01:28:30.100 --> 01:28:35.040]  hurt us, and now, heaven forbid, they're the leading cause of death, and guess what the
[01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:41.660]  government is making us do, Obamacare now is making it mandatory. It is making it mandatory
[01:28:41.660 --> 01:28:47.020]  for us to buy medical insurance, which gives us access to the type of medicine that is
[01:28:47.020 --> 01:28:53.740]  not only the leading cause of death, but it is also the cause of, while these guys have
[01:28:53.740 --> 01:28:59.460]  been driving the bus, chronic diseases skyrocketing, it is going through the roof. The only reason
[01:28:59.460 --> 01:29:04.900]  we put up with this nonsense is because there is not a free medical market in the United
[01:29:04.900 --> 01:29:10.900]  States, there isn't. You want a perfect example? The state of Illinois just fined me $5,000
[01:29:10.900 --> 01:29:16.900]  for putting the word doctor on my website. $5,000, the only person that can call them
[01:29:16.900 --> 01:29:21.940]  self a doctor in the state of Illinois are people that have MDs after their name. It's
[01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:26.620]  ridiculous ladies and gentlemen, which is why the best thing you can do for your health
[01:29:26.620 --> 01:29:31.340]  if you're suffering from a chronic disease is fire your MD now, get on board with medical
[01:29:31.340 --> 01:29:36.820]  nutrition and take your health back. Absolutely, I couldn't do what I'm doing working 18 hours

[01:32:09.420 --> 01:32:13.660]  drought to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy. Our hearts go out

[01:33:17.300 --> 01:33:33.460]  receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. We are riders on the storm. Make no mistake.
[01:33:33.460 --> 01:33:38.220]  And if we stand up against this tyranny, we'll have a better world. Couple items I want to
[01:33:38.220 --> 01:33:43.940]  draw listeners attention to upon InfoWars.com. We've talked a lot about this, but here's
[01:33:43.940 --> 01:33:51.700]  the Huffington Post. Suicides now America's leading cause of death by injury study. Because
[01:33:51.700 --> 01:33:55.220]  I see comments on YouTube and stuff going, I looked up the number one cause of death
[01:33:55.220 --> 01:34:02.740]  and it's heart attacks and then cancer and then hospital visits. Oh yes, the FDA now
[01:34:02.740 --> 01:34:08.780]  lift the hospitals. It's accidental death, them killing you with bad drug interactions
[01:34:08.780 --> 01:34:12.700]  or infections is the number three cause. But I've had Mike Adams and others on the breakdown
[01:34:12.700 --> 01:34:18.780]  of numbers, that's a low estimate they've got at 197,000 on there a year. It's way over
[01:34:18.780 --> 01:34:19.780]  that.
[01:34:19.780 --> 01:34:25.140]  But the government says it's number three, but of unnatural death, unnatural death, the
[01:34:25.140 --> 01:34:30.700]  number one cause is suicide. And that's because of the serotonin reuptake inhibitors that
[01:34:30.700 --> 01:34:35.500]  on their own inserts say they're going to kill you. Understand that's unnatural death
[01:34:35.500 --> 01:34:45.540]  by injury. And that's how they label a suicide. 22 US service people, most of them active
[01:34:45.540 --> 01:34:48.700]  duty, kill themselves every single day.
[01:34:48.700 --> 01:34:53.220]  And so that's seven times the previous record at the end of the Vietnam War, look it up.
[01:34:53.220 --> 01:34:55.740]  And you're not gonna hear Piers Morgan crying about that. You're not gonna hear him freaking
[01:34:55.740 --> 01:35:02.860]  out about that. Obviously, Dr. Peter Glidden is one of our advisors at InfoWarsHealth.com.
[01:35:02.860 --> 01:35:05.880]  And he's involved with Younggevity and we have all the products discounted with free
[01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:08.420]  shipping when you sign up at InfoWarsHealth.com.
[01:35:08.420 --> 01:35:13.300]  I really believe in these products. I've turned down countless other products that promise
[01:35:13.300 --> 01:35:18.060]  they cure this, promise they cure that. I just won't do it. Just like I've been at gold
[01:35:18.060 --> 01:35:23.380]  companies come to me and say we wanna sell numismatic collectors. And I look up the coin
[01:35:23.380 --> 01:35:26.260]  they wanna sell and it's 200, 300% markup.
[01:35:26.260 --> 01:35:33.220]  I go, nope, I won't sell gold more than a 15% markup. And most of it Ted Anderson sells
[01:35:33.220 --> 01:35:37.140]  is about a 3% to 5%. You can't even hardly fund his operation doing that, but he has
[01:35:37.140 --> 01:35:41.820]  become fifth largest goal broker in the country because he is so competitive. My point is
[01:35:41.820 --> 01:35:43.780]  is that I really try to give you a good deal.
[01:35:43.780 --> 01:35:49.900]  And this is, I've never done MLM, but that isn't even what this is. You notice Younggevity
[01:35:49.900 --> 01:35:55.820]  ever promotes themselves as a business. They use that as the computer model to have distributors
[01:35:55.820 --> 01:35:59.980]  because it works best. And that's why it's one of the most successful MLMs. And the cruddy
[01:35:59.980 --> 01:36:02.620]  ones give it a bad name, been around 16 years.
[01:36:02.620 --> 01:36:07.940]  It's unbelievable. You can go to InfoWarsTeam.com and sign up to be part of that or InfoWarsHealth.com
[01:36:07.940 --> 01:36:11.420]  just get the products. But when you sign up to be a distributor, you do get a discount.
[01:36:11.420 --> 01:36:16.100]  It's 10 bucks to sign up and get the discount. And you can also sign up and get free auto
[01:36:16.100 --> 01:36:21.300]  shipping. When you sign up for auto ship, you get free shipping. And the money we make
[01:36:21.300 --> 01:36:26.220]  off this goes into, excuse me, defending the Second Amendment.
[01:36:26.220 --> 01:36:30.420]  Bullhorned last night for about an hour and a half, so my voice is shot again. It goes
[01:36:30.420 --> 01:36:34.900]  into having all these other guests on and supporting what they're doing, supporting
[01:36:34.900 --> 01:36:39.700]  Gonders of America, standing up for liberty. We're funding ourselves with high quality
[01:36:39.700 --> 01:36:47.540]  water filters, with pro liberty t-shirts, with all these things we sell at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:36:47.540 --> 01:36:50.800]  When I like George Soros that gets banker bailout money or Warren Buffett and then Warren
[01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:56.300]  Buffett goes and finances ABC Nightly News. They now have underwriting by the globalists.
[01:36:56.300 --> 01:37:01.780]  CNN has it. CNN gets foreign governments like Qatar and others to fund them. And we don't
[01:37:01.780 --> 01:37:05.900]  have that. We have those folks all trying to make sure we're not on air. We're funded
[01:37:05.900 --> 01:37:06.900]  by you.
[01:37:06.900 --> 01:37:10.260]  And so I try to, so just having donations or something, I try to sell things I believe
[01:37:10.260 --> 01:37:16.460]  in InfoWarsHealth.com to find all the products. We'll plug them at the end of the hour. That's
[01:37:16.460 --> 01:37:22.140]  not why Dr. Glidden is here. He's here to go over the news. And I wanna get into some
[01:37:22.140 --> 01:37:23.140]  of that news.
[01:37:23.140 --> 01:37:26.220]  We're gonna get into drones as well before he leaves us. And they're now saying guilt
[01:37:26.220 --> 01:37:30.720]  by association. If we claim we think you might know somebody in a terrorist group, drones
[01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:35.700]  can kill US citizens. No judge, no jury. The president is God. So we're gonna be looking
[01:37:35.700 --> 01:37:45.220]  at all of that. But I wanted to get Dr. Glidden's take on the Clemson study, over a year long
[01:37:45.220 --> 01:37:49.540]  study by the highly respected outfit there at Clemson.
[01:37:49.540 --> 01:37:54.220]  And I had it here in my stack, but we can just punch it up on screen or maybe Richard
[01:37:54.220 --> 01:37:59.780]  can run that into me. But Dr. Glidden, I don't know if you have this in front of you. I meant
[01:37:59.780 --> 01:38:05.020]  to have the crew tell you that I wanted to get into this. Tell folks about this study
[01:38:05.020 --> 01:38:09.580]  cuz this is a scientific study by a university.
[01:38:09.580 --> 01:38:16.620]  Here is the study, thank you. Published in Yahoo News, The Street, you name it. And tell
[01:38:16.620 --> 01:38:24.900]  people what it found just beyond Tangy Tangerine did that we sell at infowarshealth.com. And
[01:38:24.900 --> 01:38:29.100]  how big of a breakthrough this is. Just an example of the system knew this. I mean, Linus
[01:38:29.100 --> 01:38:34.460]  Pauling won the Nobel Prize for similar research, but this is a modern reconfirmation. Tell
[01:38:34.460 --> 01:38:36.380]  people what it says in there.
[01:38:36.380 --> 01:38:41.180]  Well, for goodness sake, you know, the medical profession has been telling people for a hundred
[01:38:41.180 --> 01:38:45.340]  years that vitamins just give you expensive urine, that it's nonsense, don't take it.
[01:38:45.340 --> 01:38:50.420]  You can even read some reports that will tell you incorrectly in scare tactics that vitamins
[01:38:50.420 --> 01:38:56.180]  are dangerous. It's nonsense. It's nonsense. Everything that I do, everything that my colleagues
[01:38:56.180 --> 01:39:01.780]  do, all holistic physicians in the world, what we do is we provide science-based, clinically
[01:39:01.780 --> 01:39:07.840]  verified non-drug therapeutics. And so the Clemson study is awesome on two points. Because
[01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:12.580]  it looked at the Young Jevity's nutritional supplements. It looked at two of Young Jevity's
[01:39:12.580 --> 01:39:17.460]  nutritional supplements, the Beyond Tangy Tangerine and the Ultimate Classic. And it
[01:39:17.460 --> 01:39:23.500]  cultured human cells and then it added the Beyond Tangy Tangerine and the Ultimate Classic
[01:39:23.500 --> 01:39:29.420]  to it in vitro studies with human tissue cultures. And they came up with two conclusions. Number
[01:39:29.420 --> 01:39:37.300]  one, there is 100% zero toxicity. There is no toxicity, zero toxicity from the Young
[01:39:37.300 --> 01:39:42.980]  Jevity's nutritional supplements. Number two, the Young Jevity nutritional supplements Beyond
[01:39:42.980 --> 01:39:50.060]  Tangy Tangerine and Ultimate Classic increased the death of colon cancer cells. It increased
[01:39:50.060 --> 01:39:55.620]  the death of colon cancer cells. This is a breakthrough. Well, you know, it's not a breakthrough
[01:39:55.620 --> 01:40:00.940]  as far as I'm concerned because I've seen research like this for the last 24 years.
[01:40:00.940 --> 01:40:04.260]  Everything that I and my colleagues have done for the last 24 years is science-based and
[01:40:04.260 --> 01:40:09.100]  clinically verified. But this is brand new. This is a hot ticket item. And it's done by
[01:40:09.100 --> 01:40:14.660]  Clemson University. And their results were so remarkable that now they're going to follow
[01:40:14.660 --> 01:40:18.880]  through with human studies. They're going to follow through with double-blinded clinical
[01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:24.100]  trials that are actually going to show the doubters, the would-be, the ne'er-do-wells,
[01:40:24.100 --> 01:40:28.860]  the doubting Thomases. Yes, in fact, guess what? Pick your head out of the sand, lift
[01:40:28.860 --> 01:40:34.220]  yourself up, dust yourself off and take your nutritional supplements. Because if you do
[01:40:34.220 --> 01:40:40.460]  not, it is only a matter of time until your body runs out of something that it needs.
[01:40:40.460 --> 01:40:46.180]  And when it runs out of calcium or magnesium or sulfur or vitamin A or vitamin B, something
[01:40:46.180 --> 01:40:50.780]  breaks. So you get arthritis, you get heartburn, you get type 2 diabetes, you get high blood
[01:40:50.780 --> 01:40:54.620]  pressure. And you go, you're sick and you're in trouble and you're suffering. And you go
[01:40:54.620 --> 01:41:00.400]  to a medical doctor who owns medicine in your county. It's the only medicine you have access
[01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:02.180]  to and they throw a drug, it's a problem.
[01:41:02.180 --> 01:41:09.960]  Here's an example. Rob Dew, the head of the Nightly News crew, he was out tubing, got
[01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:14.940]  caught in some rocks, ripped, I forget the names of it, the ACL, but also the other side
[01:41:14.940 --> 01:41:20.580]  of his knee. They said the two different doctors, 100% you need surgery, you'll never walk again.
[01:41:20.580 --> 01:41:24.780]  I said, listen, go to a chiropractor. He said, no, I'm gonna go to one. I said, try to work
[01:41:24.780 --> 01:41:29.300]  that out. Six months later, he hiked four miles up a mountain with me and his knee is
[01:41:29.300 --> 01:41:30.560]  completely better.
[01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:35.100]  And he went to chiropractors and they worked it out and realigned it and told him the exercises
[01:41:35.100 --> 01:41:41.180]  to do and also to take high powered vitamins and minerals. And guess what? They didn't
[01:41:41.180 --> 01:41:45.800]  get to cut open his knee. Ted Anderson, they told him, you've gotta have surgery on this
[01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:50.460]  knee. Six months on Beyond Tangy Tangerine, the essential fatty acids and other products
[01:41:50.460 --> 01:41:54.060]  from mfallwarshealth.com, gone, gone.
[01:41:54.060 --> 01:41:59.020]  They absolutely do not want you to know this cuz they want to cut you open. And I'm not
[01:41:59.020 --> 01:42:05.460]  saying if you have a compound fracture, heroic MD medicine is great. I've had one, fix it.
[01:42:05.460 --> 01:42:10.620]  Car wreck, boom, my jaw smashed, my dad's a dentist, oral surgeon, fix it. But the issue
[01:42:10.620 --> 01:42:14.500]  is, you go in there with slipped disc, whatever it is, they don't ever tell you diet, get
[01:42:14.500 --> 01:42:18.980]  in shape, go to a chiropractor, go get massages, go work with a sports medicine person.
[01:42:18.980 --> 01:42:23.140]  So they say, we're gonna cut that open for it. We're gonna put a cadaver's vertebrae
[01:42:23.140 --> 01:42:24.540]  in there. How's that sound?
[01:42:24.540 --> 01:42:29.100]  Well, when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. And this is exactly why
[01:42:29.100 --> 01:42:35.080]  Dr. Wallach set Young Jevity up as a network business. This is exactly why. Because we
[01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:41.220]  have science-based clinically verified solutions for the majority of chronic illnesses. And
[01:42:41.220 --> 01:42:46.220]  your pharmaceutical industry, your medical doctor does not want you to know what we know.
[01:42:46.220 --> 01:42:52.500]  So rather than fighting big pharma, we're gonna ignore them. We're gonna do an end around.
[01:42:52.500 --> 01:42:57.540]  Young Jevity exists to build a grassroots coalition of the informed. People who get
[01:42:57.540 --> 01:43:02.140]  on board with our health recovery protocols, and then they tell their family and friends
[01:43:02.140 --> 01:43:08.180]  and church members about it. We lift each other up into health. And if you're struggling
[01:43:08.180 --> 01:43:11.940]  with financial issues also, you can also lift yourself up into wealth.
[01:43:11.940 --> 01:43:16.660]  I gotta tell you, Alex, this is the best thing to happen to medicine since the invention
[01:43:16.660 --> 01:43:21.820]  of the sterile technique. If you would not believe, you would not believe the things
[01:43:21.820 --> 01:43:26.540]  that I have seen people recover from with science-based clinically verified medical
[01:43:26.540 --> 01:43:27.540]  nutrition.
[01:43:27.540 --> 01:43:31.500]  Well, all I can say is this. I've followed about 10% of the program and have seen dramatic
[01:43:31.500 --> 01:43:35.700]  stamina increase when I was really following at 40 pounds of weight loss. But, you know,
[01:43:35.700 --> 01:43:39.500]  I work 18, 20 hours a day right now and haven't even been exercising in the last month and
[01:43:39.500 --> 01:43:42.580]  a half, so I've gained some weight back. But I've told Richard Reeves, and he's here, I'm
[01:43:42.580 --> 01:43:46.980]  going 100% back on the program, that just as soon as I can just stop working 18 hours
[01:43:46.980 --> 01:43:50.280]  a day, I'm about to have some beyond tangy tangerine right now, which I normally have
[01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:51.540]  this time of day.
[01:43:51.540 --> 01:43:56.860]  But the point is, is that I promote what I believe in. And I wanna show people a document
[01:43:56.860 --> 01:44:01.660]  cam shot here from the street. It was also in Yahoo News. If you're watching on TV, if
[01:44:01.660 --> 01:44:07.940]  not, just go to infowars.com. AEL International announces results of Young Jevity clinical
[01:44:07.940 --> 01:44:15.300]  research studies performed by Clemson University Institute of Research. And it goes on now,
[01:44:15.300 --> 01:44:16.780]  nutraceutical research.
[01:44:16.780 --> 01:44:21.420]  Now continuing, big pharma's all going into nutraceuticals now. They just change the molecules
[01:44:21.420 --> 01:44:26.140]  and try to patent it. And then they charge you $400 or 200 bottles, you know, for one
[01:44:26.140 --> 01:44:35.020]  bottle of something like fish oil. But expanding on this, I wanna read here and maybe back
[01:44:35.020 --> 01:44:38.540]  out a little bit so viewers can actually see the whole article here. There you go. I wanna
[01:44:38.540 --> 01:44:39.540]  read from this.
[01:44:39.540 --> 01:44:43.160]  The clinical studies were performed to identify the potential benefits of Young Jevity signature
[01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:48.300]  core products beyond tangy tangerine and ultimate classics at infowarshealth.com. Young Jevity's
[01:44:48.300 --> 01:44:53.900]  mission was to truly understand and clinically substantiate the health promoting benefits
[01:44:53.900 --> 01:44:54.900]  of these two products.
[01:44:54.900 --> 01:44:58.220]  Individually, each product targets specific areas, needs nutritional deficiency of the
[01:44:58.220 --> 01:45:03.660]  body. And then it goes on to break it down with what they found. It found with healthy
[01:45:03.660 --> 01:45:11.740]  colon cells, didn't hurt them. With the cancer cells, massively killed them. I'm gonna read,
[01:45:11.740 --> 01:45:15.500]  this is from Clemson, folks. This is certified. And remember, it's Dr. Wallach that sued the
[01:45:15.500 --> 01:45:18.020]  FDA over and over again and won.
[01:45:18.020 --> 01:45:22.220]  He used to work for the federal government. He's the guy at the core of stopping them
[01:45:22.220 --> 01:45:26.860]  banning vitamins in the 90s. I mean, this is the big group. These are the head honchos,
[01:45:26.860 --> 01:45:32.260]  okay? These are the Super Bowl champions here, okay? Says, would be on tangy tangerine and
[01:45:32.260 --> 01:45:35.080]  ultimate classic were administered to healthy human cells.
[01:45:35.080 --> 01:45:41.580]  They did not induce or create any inflammatory response in levels above and below the recommended
[01:45:41.580 --> 01:45:46.860]  dosage. Beyond tangy tangerine and ultimate classic showed inflammation protective properties
[01:45:46.860 --> 01:45:53.700]  and heightened the body's protective response to possible inflammation, the autoimmune response.
[01:45:53.700 --> 01:45:58.220]  Would be on tangy tangerine and ultimate classics were administered to healthy human colon cells.
[01:45:58.220 --> 01:46:02.420]  There was no significant death of healthy human cells compared to the cancerous colon
[01:46:02.420 --> 01:46:03.420]  cells.
[01:46:03.420 --> 01:46:11.660]  Ultimate classic killed 95% of cancerous colon cells, 65% of cancerous liver cells, 65% of
[01:46:11.660 --> 01:46:17.620]  cancerous stomach cells, and 30% of cancerous breast cells. It goes on, beyond tangy tangerine
[01:46:17.620 --> 01:46:23.220]  killed 60% of cancerous colon cells, 65% of cancerous liver and stomach cells, and 30%
[01:46:23.220 --> 01:46:24.860]  of cancerous breast cells.
[01:46:24.860 --> 01:46:30.020]  And it goes on, beyond tangy tangerine and ultimate classic both exhibited efficient
[01:46:30.020 --> 01:46:34.340]  inhibition of the proliferation of cancerous cells and the recommendation dose. Now again,
[01:46:34.340 --> 01:46:37.780]  everybody knows about the big studies on the alternative cancer treatments injecting vitamin
[01:46:37.780 --> 01:46:41.760]  C at the medical facilities and that they charge so much money.
[01:46:41.760 --> 01:46:45.960]  The point is Linus Pauling got the Nobel Prize, I have to look it up and forget which year,
[01:46:45.960 --> 01:46:50.660]  for this. They found mega dosages of vitamin C. This isn't just vitamin C, this is all
[01:46:50.660 --> 01:46:54.100]  the trace elements, the minerals, the vitamins. And sure, if you're too far gone, this may
[01:46:54.100 --> 01:46:55.100]  not help you.
[01:46:55.100 --> 01:46:59.020]  My point is, is that there's all these people claiming. Sponsors come to me and they go,
[01:46:59.020 --> 01:47:05.380]  we will give you $100,000 every quarter to say that this thing will kill cancer, no problem.
[01:47:05.380 --> 01:47:08.860]  And there's no proof, I go, I'm not gonna do it. Okay, I went out and hunted around,
[01:47:08.860 --> 01:47:14.020]  I said, everybody's financing themselves with products that are health oriented, I'm not
[01:47:14.020 --> 01:47:16.500]  gonna do it, cuz so much of it's quackville.
[01:47:16.500 --> 01:47:20.420]  But I had known about dead doctors, don't lie, I'd done my research. I saw Ted on it,
[01:47:20.420 --> 01:47:26.540]  my family on it, 97 pounds, 98 pounds lost by Aaron Dykes. Was not even advertised as
[01:47:26.540 --> 01:47:30.740]  weight loss, he totally follows the program religiously. And I'm just like, whoa, what
[01:47:30.740 --> 01:47:32.860]  is this? I mean, this is amazing.
[01:47:32.860 --> 01:47:37.240]  And again, it's because it's everything your body needs. And that's why they've adulterated
[01:47:37.240 --> 01:47:42.000]  the food and water, as Bertrand Russell said in the 30s, to make you addled and stupid
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:46.460]  and sick so they can push you over. So many times I talk to US troops, they go, why could
[01:47:46.460 --> 01:47:47.460]  you defeat the Iraqis?
[01:47:47.460 --> 01:47:53.780]  He said, they've been under 15 years of sanctions or whatever. They were so debilitated that
[01:47:53.780 --> 01:47:58.260]  you could beat up a full grown man with one arm tied behind your back, okay? I mean, they
[01:47:58.260 --> 01:48:03.160]  want us debilitated as well. Now, I've been ranting, and I meant to get you on about some
[01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:05.320]  other issues, but I wanted to talk about this.
[01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:11.320]  This is Clemson University with a scientific study. This should be one of the biggest news
[01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:17.280]  issues out there. But I remember Linus Pauling's Nobel Prize for just vitamin C doing things
[01:48:17.280 --> 01:48:22.040]  like this. What is it in the Beyond Tangy Tangerine and other products at Infowarshealth.com
[01:48:22.040 --> 01:48:26.600]  that is doing this? I mean, how big of a deal is this? What is it doing in your colon?
[01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:32.720]  Well, it's a gigantic deal. And see, this is the thing. This is the greatest thing about
[01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:37.320]  science-based clinically verified medical nutrition. And thank God for Dr. Wallach.
[01:48:37.320 --> 01:48:44.080]  Thank God for Dr. Wallach. When it comes to medical nutrition, the recipe is everything.
[01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:48.160]  Chicken's not really any different than wine. They're all made from grapes, but there's
[01:48:48.160 --> 01:48:52.760]  a great deal of difference between Annie Boone Springs green apple wine and a nice California
[01:48:52.760 --> 01:48:58.320]  Cabernet or chicken soup. What's the difference? The recipe's the difference. Well, Young Jevity's
[01:48:58.320 --> 01:49:05.280]  nutritional supplements are informed by $25 million of federally funded research, the
[01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:10.200]  results of which are now in the Smithsonian that Dr. Wallach was in charge of. They did
[01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:17.280]  26,000 autopsies, 10 million blood chemistries and histopathologies, and then Wallach took
[01:49:17.280 --> 01:49:25.720]  all of that information, gleaned from all of this old-fashioned, straight-laced, boots-on-the-ground
[01:49:25.720 --> 01:49:30.960]  pragmatic research, and he started applying it with patients as a naturopathic physician.
[01:49:30.960 --> 01:49:35.880]  When you put those two things together, the massive amounts of pragmatic research and
[01:49:35.880 --> 01:49:43.400]  decades of clinical experience, you start to get a clue. Our basic understanding here,
[01:49:43.400 --> 01:49:49.760]  our basic message is your body has a God-given ability to fix itself. It's a God-given ability
[01:49:49.760 --> 01:49:55.360]  to fix itself. Your body knows how to fix itself. Your body wants to fix itself. What
[01:49:55.360 --> 01:50:02.480]  your body needs to fix itself is 90 essential nutrients, 60 minerals, 16 vitamins, 12 amino
[01:50:02.480 --> 01:50:08.240]  acids, and two essential fatty acids, and that is what the Beyond Tangy Tangerine and
[01:50:08.240 --> 01:50:14.280]  the Healthy Start Pack provide for you. They give your body all of the essential nutrients
[01:50:14.280 --> 01:50:20.120]  that it needs to maintain and optimize its health, and they give it to you in the best,
[01:50:20.120 --> 01:50:25.600]  most sophisticated, most researched, most clinically verified recipe there is. It's
[01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:26.960]  a no-brainer, folks.

[01:52:56.480 --> 01:53:04.400]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the bestselling book, Cancer Step Outside the
[01:53:04.400 --> 01:53:10.720]  Box. I want you to know some very important information. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan
[01:53:10.720 --> 01:53:14.860]  requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the
[01:53:14.860 --> 01:53:20.420]  President could obtain this world-class healer. Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are
[01:53:20.420 --> 01:53:24.960]  used around the world to keep people healthy. Now you can protect yourself and your loved
[01:53:24.960 --> 01:53:30.640]  ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond
[01:53:30.640 --> 01:53:35.680]  to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell. If you want to stay healthy,
[01:53:35.680 --> 01:53:40.080]  now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders
[01:53:40.080 --> 01:53:50.080]  that don't belong in your body. Call 1-866-VenusFly or order from Carnivora.com. That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A.com.
[01:53:50.080 --> 01:53:58.560]  That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VenusFly or visit Carnivora.com. Protect your immune system.
[01:53:58.560 --> 01:54:00.560]  It's the only one you've got.
[01:54:28.560 --> 01:54:35.680]  You might be connected to a terror group. We're gonna kill Americans with drones. And
[01:54:35.680 --> 01:54:39.080]  then I was, and that's a Justice Department memo, and then I was looking at some of the
[01:54:39.080 --> 01:54:44.760]  other stuff. Amnesty would add two trillion to long-term cost of Obamacare. And that's
[01:54:44.760 --> 01:54:55.200]  the job, bankrupt things. See, citizens have to pay up to $20,000 a year for a family.
[01:54:55.200 --> 01:55:00.320]  But the illegals are still gonna get it all free. I mean, this is designed to bring this
[01:55:00.320 --> 01:55:08.020]  country down. This is absolutely insane what's happening. And meanwhile, Israel just took
[01:55:08.020 --> 01:55:14.400]  part of Syria. We're gonna cover that next hour. I mean, this is all just escalating
[01:55:14.400 --> 01:55:20.040]  rapidly while the government armors up against the American people.
[01:55:20.040 --> 01:55:24.160]  And now is the time to point out that this is all out of control. And the reason I focus
[01:55:24.160 --> 01:55:31.960]  on the health issue sometimes is that somewhere we can at least take care of ourselves. Look
[01:55:31.960 --> 01:55:38.720]  at this new story. Court, New York Times request for list of city gun owners violates the law.
[01:55:38.720 --> 01:55:46.000]  Yeah, I mean, they make you register if you can jump through 1,000 hoops in the state
[01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:47.240]  of New York and all these places.
[01:55:47.240 --> 01:55:51.720]  And then Bloomberg gets it and publishes your name so criminals know where to rob to get
[01:55:51.720 --> 01:55:56.520]  guns. I mean, it's just pure terrorism. These people are thugs. They ought to be arrested.
[01:55:56.520 --> 01:56:01.360]  Of course, it violates the law. I said it violates the law at the time. Okay, getting
[01:56:01.360 --> 01:56:03.240]  back to this, let me just give people the number.
[01:56:03.240 --> 01:56:06.960]  I said that it kind of discriminates against folks that aren't online or don't like to
[01:56:06.960 --> 01:56:13.380]  be online. If you wanna call the Info Wars Health information line to learn more or sign

[01:56:31.720 --> 01:56:37.480]  get other special deals, it's 877-551-1301. And I'm done plugging, but that is also one
[01:56:37.480 --> 01:56:42.320]  of our main sponsors. Now we support ourselves and it is a revolution in health. I wanna
[01:56:42.320 --> 01:56:47.060]  get into digestive stuff in the next little short five minute segment we have, Dr. Glidden.
[01:56:47.060 --> 01:56:53.940]  But briefly, finishing up on Obamacare, written by the insurance companies, absolutely increasing
[01:56:53.940 --> 01:57:02.920]  the price for healthcare, poor people having their bills increased, payroll taxes going
[01:57:02.920 --> 01:57:03.920]  up on poor people.
[01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:09.640]  I mean, what's gonna happen when the public finds out that Obamacare is the power to tax,
[01:57:09.640 --> 01:57:18.040]  is the power to destroy, that it is both feet stomping down on us, just total takeover?
[01:57:18.040 --> 01:57:21.880]  Well, what's gonna happen when people finally pick their heads up out of the sand and realize
[01:57:21.880 --> 01:57:26.440]  that MDs, bless their hearts, again, don't practice healthcare, they practice disease
[01:57:26.440 --> 01:57:30.320]  management. It's disease management, it's not healthcare. If it was healthcare, we'd
[01:57:30.320 --> 01:57:35.080]  be getting better. It's disease management, we're getting sicker. Alzheimer's is increasing,
[01:57:35.080 --> 01:57:39.080]  autism is increasing, high blood pressure is increasing, arthritis is increasing, obesity
[01:57:39.080 --> 01:57:45.640]  is increasing, and we live less and less and less. Our life expectancies are getting shorter
[01:57:45.640 --> 01:57:46.640]  and shorter.
[01:57:46.640 --> 01:57:51.840]  This is the bigger issue here. This is the bigger issue that nobody sees. MD directed
[01:57:51.840 --> 01:57:55.920]  medical treatments not only are the leading cause of death, they're also the leading cause
[01:57:55.920 --> 01:58:00.880]  of bankruptcy. Why are they the leading cause of bankruptcy? Because they don't work. They
[01:58:00.880 --> 01:58:05.200]  work best for trauma, that's their domain, that's their domain. You got a bullet in your
[01:58:05.200 --> 01:58:09.840]  arm, you got a third degree burn, you got a triple compound fracture, go to the MD.
[01:58:09.840 --> 01:58:15.080]  That's their wheelhouse, that's what they're good for. But listen, when you go to an MD
[01:58:15.080 --> 01:58:20.400]  prescribing symptom suppressive drugs in a managerial fashion for chronic disease, guess
[01:58:20.400 --> 01:58:26.920]  what? You get sicker and sicker and sicker and sicker.
[01:58:26.920 --> 01:58:30.360]  I want to come back and talk about something you've been talking about for more than a
[01:58:30.360 --> 01:58:36.840]  decade and so is Dr. Wallach now really picking up this wheat belly or this situation with
[01:58:36.840 --> 01:58:40.040]  what gluten's doing in digestive health.
[01:58:40.040 --> 01:58:52.920]  You are listening to GCN. Visit GCNlive.com today.

[02:00:11.440 --> 02:00:19.440]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin,
[02:00:19.440 --> 02:00:21.440]  Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:21.440 --> 02:00:35.720]  It's our final segment with Dr. Peter Glidden, syndicated talk show host right here on Genesis
[02:00:35.720 --> 02:00:40.600]  GCNlive.com. I'm Alex Jones, your host. I'm going to give the number out in the next segment.
[02:00:40.600 --> 02:00:43.720]  We'll cover news for one segment and then take calls, I promise, for the full balance
[02:00:43.720 --> 02:00:47.800]  of the last 40 minutes of the next hour or this hour we've now entered. I'll give the
[02:00:47.800 --> 02:00:50.960]  number out at the start of the next segment for everybody that would like to join us on
[02:00:50.960 --> 02:00:53.660]  any of the issues we've raised today.
[02:00:53.660 --> 02:00:57.960]  But Dr. Glidden, some of the other products, there's over 300. It's close to 400 up at
[02:00:57.960 --> 02:01:04.440]  mfowarshealth.com, the site that has the full listing of all the great Young Jeopardy products.

[02:01:09.560 --> 02:01:15.200]  the stomach and gets into the intestines. Tastes like Root Beer, a little packet. Kids
[02:01:15.200 --> 02:01:21.680]  love it. They've also got the new, let me show people this. This is what I give my kids.
[02:01:21.680 --> 02:01:26.880]  They love it. It's really good chocolate. Young Jeopardy Triple Truffle Chocolate Antioxidant

[02:01:32.480 --> 02:01:39.220]  way to get vitamins and minerals into your children. That's all there as well at mfowarshealth.com.
[02:01:39.220 --> 02:01:42.640]  Let's go check it out, folks. It's all there. But in closing, in the four minutes we've
[02:01:42.640 --> 02:01:47.700]  got left, you've got the floor. The gut, the thing we're hearing about wheat belly and
[02:01:47.700 --> 02:01:50.680]  all this. What's really happening?
[02:01:50.680 --> 02:01:55.340]  Well here's the deal. Our whole basic premise here is that chronic diseases, the majority
[02:01:55.340 --> 02:02:00.240]  of chronic diseases are caused by nutrient deficiencies. You don't get high blood pressure
[02:02:00.240 --> 02:02:05.120]  or type 2 diabetes because you have a bad gene or because you have a voodoo curse. You
[02:02:05.120 --> 02:02:09.880]  get these illnesses because your body has run out of the raw materials necessary to
[02:02:09.880 --> 02:02:13.380]  maintain that part of your body. The same way you run out of oil in your car, the engine
[02:02:13.380 --> 02:02:18.080]  seizes, right? It's kind of a no brainer. But MDs aren't trained in medical nutrition.
[02:02:18.080 --> 02:02:22.800]  They don't have any experience, no appreciation, no respect for it. So they don't know what
[02:02:22.800 --> 02:02:29.080]  we know. And what we know is that when you give your body the raw materials necessary
[02:02:29.080 --> 02:02:34.000]  for your body to function optimally and you stop eating food that's coming up the works,
[02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:38.760]  guess what? Most of the time your body rallies and fixes itself.
[02:02:38.760 --> 02:02:43.120]  So there are two things that we advise people to do. Fill your body up with the 90 essential
[02:02:43.120 --> 02:02:47.280]  nutrients. Take one healthy start pack per 100 pounds of body weight per month. One healthy
[02:02:47.280 --> 02:02:52.360]  start pack per 100 pounds of body weight per month. And by the way, Alex, full disclosure,
[02:02:52.360 --> 02:02:57.680]  I have extracted myself from the revenue stream of the vitamin sales in YoungJevity. Dr. Glidden
[02:02:57.680 --> 02:03:03.760]  does not make any money from talking up vitamins. I make zero. Quite frankly, I got sick of
[02:03:03.760 --> 02:03:08.200]  people saying, oh, Dr. G, you're just trying to make money selling vitamins. Well, guess
[02:03:08.200 --> 02:03:14.180]  what? I don't make any. My fiance does. My son does. People in my family do. People in
[02:03:14.180 --> 02:03:18.720]  my community do because they're not stupid. They saw the opportunity and grabbed that
[02:03:18.720 --> 02:03:19.720]  bull by the horse.
[02:03:19.720 --> 02:03:25.080]  Yeah, but they always say that. I've had CNN say, you're trying to make money. Obama said
[02:03:25.080 --> 02:03:28.720]  that. Of course I've got to make money to fund my operation and I promote what I believe
[02:03:28.720 --> 02:03:34.800]  in. Again, they do that to put people off balance. Oh, don't get into vitamins and minerals.
[02:03:34.800 --> 02:03:39.160]  Don't get into the very best out there. Oh no, the alternative media shouldn't finance
[02:03:39.160 --> 02:03:42.160]  itself. We have bigger audiences than they do.
[02:03:42.160 --> 02:03:49.040]  They just have the big rotting facade that is coming down. And I am proud to finance
[02:03:49.040 --> 02:03:55.160]  myself and not take taxpayer money like MSNBC. I am proud to not spend $32 million a week
[02:03:55.160 --> 02:04:03.920]  like the outgoing Secretary of Defense spends per weekend flight. I think that's actually
[02:04:03.920 --> 02:04:06.880]  millions of dollars.
[02:04:06.880 --> 02:04:10.200]  How much does Obama spend just to fly somewhere? Let me find the Panetta article that I was
[02:04:10.200 --> 02:04:17.360]  looking at on Drudge. This is just absolutely incredible. Yeah, yeah, it's $32,000 tab per
[02:04:17.360 --> 02:04:21.920]  weekend trip and that's nothing. Something like Obama per Air Force One trip or something
[02:04:21.920 --> 02:04:29.920]  was like $11 million. But oh, we're bad if we say, hey, they want you sick. Look out.
[02:04:29.920 --> 02:04:34.880]  They want to cut you up. They know you've got vitamin deficiencies and mineral deficiencies.
[02:04:34.880 --> 02:04:37.360]  Check this out. It's just incredible.
[02:04:37.360 --> 02:04:41.720]  Dr Glidden, thank you so much for spending time with us today.
[02:04:41.720 --> 02:04:44.560]  Always a pleasure, Alex. My pleasure. I look forward to seeing you next time.
[02:04:44.560 --> 02:04:49.280]  You bet. Absolutely. I want to come back with a big news blitz. I'm gonna just focus, get
[02:04:49.280 --> 02:04:53.120]  a bunch of stories. We'll see if I can do it. And then we're gonna take your phone calls.
[02:04:53.120 --> 02:05:01.240]  All this and more coming up. Stay with us.

[02:08:20.560 --> 02:08:26.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now into another hour of worldwide broadcast. I am Alex Jones,
[02:08:26.640 --> 02:08:33.600]  your host waging war on corruption, crashing through the lies and disinformation. We are
[02:08:33.600 --> 02:08:41.520]  here Monday through Friday 12 noon to 3 p.m. Eastern. What is that? 9 a.m. until 12 noon
[02:08:41.520 --> 02:08:48.240]  Pacific. The news websites are Infowars.com. And of course, we're also streaming video
[02:08:48.240 --> 02:08:54.640]  at Infowarsnews.com. And we have subscription memberships to watch the nightly news and
[02:08:54.640 --> 02:08:58.840]  see all of my films there at Infowarsnews.com and prisonplanet.tv.
[02:08:58.840 --> 02:09:07.280]  Okay, I've had several guests on including the gun shop, mega gun shop owner out of the
[02:09:07.280 --> 02:09:13.000]  suburbs of Houston where Piers Morgan showed up yesterday and Katie and didn't want the
[02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:16.480]  public to know where he was scared of the public. He showed up with guards, of course,
[02:09:16.480 --> 02:09:20.360]  and we have video of all this. We're gonna be premiering tonight on the nightly news
[02:09:20.360 --> 02:09:27.320]  7 o'clock down at Tactical Firearms in South Texas.
[02:09:27.320 --> 02:09:34.620]  And there's video up on Infowars.com where I surprised Piers Morgan backstage and I just
[02:09:34.620 --> 02:09:40.880]  shot it on my phone. And I wanted to go down there and just challenge him. Hey, you say
[02:09:40.880 --> 02:09:45.000]  you won that debate, but you don't wanna have me back on even though they admit it's the
[02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:46.960]  highest ratings Piers Morgan ever had.
[02:09:46.960 --> 02:09:51.080]  And we have the CNN lady saying, I'd love to get you back on, it's the highest ratings
[02:09:51.080 --> 02:09:57.320]  we've ever had. He got higher ratings for a whole week. Again, because it was something
[02:09:57.320 --> 02:10:04.320]  interesting and wasn't completely scripted and I got in his face and it woke people up.
[02:10:04.320 --> 02:10:08.200]  Now let's go over some of the news and I'm gonna go to your phone calls. The toll free
[02:10:08.200 --> 02:10:18.960]  number to join us on air is 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231. Now yesterday, I saw mainstream
[02:10:18.960 --> 02:10:24.200]  news articles out of Houston saying that the owner of the Tactical Firearms said that ammo
[02:10:24.200 --> 02:10:27.400]  should have to be bought with a record.
[02:10:27.400 --> 02:10:30.800]  And he said he never said that, they cut up an interview to make it look like that. And
[02:10:30.800 --> 02:10:35.360]  Mike Adams had known the guy for about five years, even before he started his business.
[02:10:35.360 --> 02:10:40.440]  And I talked to everybody, they said it's not true. But regardless, I said, well, we'll
[02:10:40.440 --> 02:10:44.480]  just have a protest down there because of this, cuz I thought it'd be them all in there
[02:10:44.480 --> 02:10:46.080]  and lovey-dovey.
[02:10:46.080 --> 02:10:50.740]  But I got the call, I went down there, and I got to go in behind the scenes and actually
[02:10:50.740 --> 02:10:54.120]  kind of freak out Piers Morgan. I didn't catch that part on tape cuz I had the phone down
[02:10:54.120 --> 02:10:58.160]  on my side shooting, but we're gonna get the surveillance camera tape. And I saw it, he
[02:10:58.160 --> 02:11:03.300]  jumped when he saw me, like, whoa, Alex Jones, absolutely classic.
[02:11:03.300 --> 02:11:07.000]  And they got a lot of surveillance in that facility, over 100 cameras. And so he says
[02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:10.500]  he's gonna give it to us. And I'm really looking forward to that. You're gonna get to see the
[02:11:10.500 --> 02:11:15.280]  real interviews that were done with Piers Morgan and not what was edited, because he
[02:11:15.280 --> 02:11:20.360]  lied to them and said, you will be live and these points will be made.
[02:11:20.360 --> 02:11:27.000]  And he would say things like, well, the reason you can't miss with a shotgun is that it has
[02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:31.120]  a wider pattern. And you don't wanna kill people on the other side of the wall as a
[02:11:31.120 --> 02:11:35.600]  handgun or rifle can do, you can also shoot your neighbors. They just edited it down to,
[02:11:35.600 --> 02:11:39.760]  you can't miss with a shotgun, by the way, you kill your neighbors.
[02:11:39.760 --> 02:11:44.000]  You see, that's the type of deception that they engage in. One minute he's wearing safety
[02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:48.560]  glasses, it cuts to Piers, cuts back, he's not wearing the safety glasses. It's one thing
[02:11:48.560 --> 02:11:52.140]  to edit things, cuz if you got hours of video, you gotta do that, or there's a particular
[02:11:52.140 --> 02:11:53.360]  part you wanna play.
[02:11:53.360 --> 02:11:59.480]  But you can't just sit there and mix things together to where someone is saying something
[02:11:59.480 --> 02:12:04.800]  that they didn't really say. I mean, an example of that is, I mimicked the Illuminati hand
[02:12:04.800 --> 02:12:11.240]  signs that were being made at the Super Bowl yesterday. And driving home last night, when
[02:12:11.240 --> 02:12:18.320]  I got home, I knew that I could type in Alex Jones does Illuminati hand sign and see the
[02:12:18.320 --> 02:12:20.440]  other times I've done it and see that.
[02:12:20.440 --> 02:12:25.140]  And it's already out there going, look, he's making the sign. I mean, I've gone and given
[02:12:25.140 --> 02:12:33.680]  speeches before and said, this sign, El Diablo, people do it for UT, they don't know this
[02:12:33.680 --> 02:12:37.400]  is the sign of the devil. But really, it's not the sign of the devil, it was the sign
[02:12:37.400 --> 02:12:39.240]  to ward off the devil in Italy.
[02:12:39.240 --> 02:12:46.520]  Well, they take that still and say, I'm doing the El Diablo, you see? So the general public
[02:12:46.520 --> 02:12:51.780]  and mentally ill people and schizophrenics, but also just jealous people, they do what
[02:12:51.780 --> 02:13:01.760]  CNN does. But see, that's taking something out of context, that's intellectually dishonest.
[02:13:01.760 --> 02:13:09.520]  And that's why Piers Morgan makes me so angry, is that I heard him talking going, yeah, look,
[02:13:09.520 --> 02:13:10.520]  he's not wearing a jacket.
[02:13:10.520 --> 02:13:14.760]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, shoot from a low angle, yeah, yeah, yeah, the belly. I got a little
[02:13:14.760 --> 02:13:17.840]  bit of belly when I stand up early when I'm sitting down, I got a little bit of a pot
[02:13:17.840 --> 02:13:23.720]  belly. And I'm still going, you're gonna make me look bad. It's just, he'll forget you,
[02:13:23.720 --> 02:13:25.040]  I'm done.
[02:13:25.040 --> 02:13:28.040]  And I'm done talking about Piers Morgan for now, we're gonna hear some of that tonight,
[02:13:28.040 --> 02:13:34.200]  7 o'clock. But let me just run through some of these headlines here. Here it is, exclusive,
[02:13:34.200 --> 02:13:39.080]  Justice Department reveals legal case for drone strikes on Americans. And they used
[02:13:39.080 --> 02:13:43.440]  a case of amoral al-Awlaki, I think that was a stage killing, he was admittedly CIA, on
[02:13:43.440 --> 02:13:44.440]  record.
[02:13:44.440 --> 02:13:48.320]  So when that came out, he was CIA, I predicted they'd stage his death, and they did, I don't
[02:13:48.320 --> 02:13:51.960]  believe that for a minute, it's called being sheep dipped. It's just a simulant terrorist,
[02:13:51.960 --> 02:13:55.760]  that they, we gotta take your rights cuz of this guy, we gotta set up checkpoints cuz
[02:13:55.760 --> 02:13:58.720]  of this guy, by the way, now it's for gun owners.
[02:13:58.720 --> 02:14:03.360]  But Justice Department memo reveals legal case for drone strikes. And reading here,
[02:14:03.360 --> 02:14:07.400]  it says Justice Department memo concludes that US government can order the killing of
[02:14:07.400 --> 02:14:11.280]  American citizens if they are believed to be senior operational leaders of Al-Qaeda
[02:14:11.280 --> 02:14:17.200]  or an associated force. Even if there's no intelligence indicating, they are engaging
[02:14:17.200 --> 02:14:21.040]  in activities and to actively plot to attack the US.
[02:14:21.040 --> 02:14:26.280]  So guilt by association, and again, you remember Kony, the propaganda last year, that it turned
[02:14:26.280 --> 02:14:30.600]  out was connected to the government and major foundations, Kony 2012 that we shot down?
[02:14:30.600 --> 02:14:39.360]  They didn't care, they got a presidential order saying that anybody connected to Kony
[02:14:39.360 --> 02:14:44.280]  or any of his associates or anyone we claim might be an associate in any place in Africa
[02:14:44.280 --> 02:14:49.480]  we could invade. And now they're invading countries 1,000 miles away from Central African
[02:14:49.480 --> 02:14:51.880]  country where Kony hadn't been seen for six and a half years.
[02:14:51.880 --> 02:14:57.080]  They just say, there's a dead guy, hadn't been seen in the jungle, we gotta invade anywhere
[02:14:57.080 --> 02:15:05.320]  in Africa. Because you're giving aid to Kony. Meanwhile, the UN is in that very African
[02:15:05.320 --> 02:15:09.440]  country. I'm having that moment where I can't remember what's the name of the Central African
[02:15:09.440 --> 02:15:10.440]  country.
[02:15:10.440 --> 02:15:14.600]  It'll pop in my head that Kony was supposedly in and then he went north. No, no, it's not
[02:15:14.600 --> 02:15:19.200]  Mali where they just attacked and had the French go in. I'm gonna type in Joseph Kony,
[02:15:19.200 --> 02:15:25.160]  it'll come up. Joseph Kony. Uganda, yeah, I was having one of those moments where I
[02:15:25.160 --> 02:15:26.400]  couldn't remember and it was killing me.
[02:15:26.400 --> 02:15:31.540]  It was killing me that I could remember Uganda and all about Uganda and its whole history
[02:15:31.540 --> 02:15:36.360]  and the idiom mean and all the craziness and then I suddenly couldn't remember it. Okay,
[02:15:36.360 --> 02:15:42.400]  let's go ahead now and continue through these articles. Justice Department memo reveals
[02:15:42.400 --> 02:15:48.000]  legal case for drone strikes on Americans and it just says, we'll kill you if we want.
[02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:51.640]  And yeah, we'll use them to arrest people. We say you're cattle thieves in North Dakota
[02:15:51.640 --> 02:15:55.460]  and we'll surveil you with it and we'll use your tax money to do it.
[02:15:55.460 --> 02:16:01.160]  But we want your guns. Here's another one, an example of how dangerous Mexico is. And
[02:16:01.160 --> 02:16:04.960]  even Cancun's having stuff happen like this in it now, but the media doesn't want you
[02:16:04.960 --> 02:16:10.060]  to know generally on the State Department even puts out a travel advisory. Acapulco
[02:16:10.060 --> 02:16:14.760]  tourists tied up with bikinis all under 30s.
[02:16:14.760 --> 02:16:19.080]  The men tied up with electrical wire while the women were tied up with their own bikinis
[02:16:19.080 --> 02:16:24.960]  and gang raped before they were robbed. I think you wanna go to Acapulco or any of those
[02:16:24.960 --> 02:16:31.200]  places in Mexico? Nowhere's gonna be safe there soon, folks. They have almost 60,000
[02:16:31.200 --> 02:16:33.640]  dead and all the guns were taken from the citizens.
[02:16:33.640 --> 02:16:38.680]  Citizens can't have guns, but we should pay for anybody that wants to flee Mexico to come
[02:16:38.680 --> 02:16:42.760]  up here and get free Obamacare and free kids they can have and anchor babies. And then
[02:16:42.760 --> 02:16:46.560]  I've gotta pay for it and you gotta pay for it. And you're racist if you don't like it.
[02:16:46.560 --> 02:16:51.040]  Hey, can I go to Mexico and hey, I'm here, my wife's nine months pregnant. I walk in
[02:16:51.040 --> 02:16:56.880]  the hospital. Not only are you gonna have my kid in here, but you're gonna pay for it.
[02:16:56.880 --> 02:17:02.920]  The Mexicans would literally laugh at you. I mean, can you imagine going to Mexico saying
[02:17:02.920 --> 02:17:09.960]  that? Yeah, I'm here to get welfare and I'm here to get a free birth. But again, that's
[02:17:09.960 --> 02:17:13.440]  racist even asking to go to Mexico if you're Hispanic, black, white, doesn't matter and
[02:17:13.440 --> 02:17:14.440]  ask to have a kid.
[02:17:14.440 --> 02:17:19.120]  I mean, the cops will shake you down, throw you in jail. We should just merge with Mexico.
[02:17:19.120 --> 02:17:25.580]  It's a great thing, turn our guns in like they've done. Let's continue here. US draws
[02:17:25.580 --> 02:17:31.760]  up battle plan to stave off digital attacks. Now, this is out of the independent. And you'll
[02:17:31.760 --> 02:17:34.840]  notice that I've been talking about this for four years.
[02:17:34.840 --> 02:17:39.040]  Because Homeland Security and the Cyber Command made up of the four branches of the military
[02:17:39.040 --> 02:17:43.440]  said in speeches we play clips of, these are public, that they will go out and start hacking
[02:17:43.440 --> 02:17:48.720]  and attacking anyone who isn't for the mission domestically. Domestic propaganda shutting
[02:17:48.720 --> 02:17:53.360]  down alternative media websites, attacking people, and they do stuff like go on your
[02:17:53.360 --> 02:17:57.160]  website and call for people to hack a government server.
[02:17:57.160 --> 02:18:00.920]  Then that's an excuse on a message board, cuz it's on your message board, to then attack
[02:18:00.920 --> 02:18:07.680]  your website. And that is the new issue. And even mainstream media says this is a total
[02:18:07.680 --> 02:18:12.640]  police state takeover. And that we're going to the Russian or Chinese style of the Internet.
[02:18:12.640 --> 02:18:16.480]  I mean, that's not Alex Jones saying that, that's CNET News. Even Google, whose connection
[02:18:16.480 --> 02:18:24.200]  to the government admits that. Look, the cause of the Super Bowl power outage remains unclear.
[02:18:24.200 --> 02:18:29.200]  Who turned out the lights, AP reports. Nobody knows, there's not gonna be an investigation.
[02:18:29.200 --> 02:18:33.000]  And it says NFL commissioners didn't seem to care one bit when lights went out. They
[02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:38.320]  seem to be calm, like they knew what was going on.
[02:18:38.320 --> 02:18:41.960]  Folks, it's all about turning the lights out to teach you to not have power all the time.
[02:18:41.960 --> 02:18:45.280]  They do it officially all over the world. It's called Earth Hour, Earth Day, the rest
[02:18:45.280 --> 02:18:49.520]  of it. Enron did it to train everybody to accept higher power prices. They would turn
[02:18:49.520 --> 02:18:52.280]  the power off intermittently to prepare you for that.
[02:18:52.280 --> 02:18:55.900]  Because for whatever reason, psychologically, you will accept higher prices if you believe
[02:18:55.900 --> 02:19:02.240]  it's scarce. So there's the big whitewash there. Okay, shifting gears, US gun owners
[02:19:02.240 --> 02:19:07.540]  outnumber hunters five to one in 2011. Well, they harass hunters so much and made it so
[02:19:07.540 --> 02:19:12.400]  expensive that, yeah, it's cost prohibitive. People are buying guns to protect themselves,
[02:19:12.400 --> 02:19:16.680]  not to go hunting. Americans don't have time to go hunting anymore, too busy working three
[02:19:16.680 --> 02:19:17.680]  jobs.
[02:19:17.680 --> 02:19:21.800]  So you can pay $20,000 a year for the Obamacare. You can pay all the new taxes on people making
[02:19:21.800 --> 02:19:26.000]  $30,000 a year that Obama promised not to do, just like he promised not to have NDAA.
[02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:29.920]  He promised to kill the Patriot Act. He promised to end all these wars, which he has expanded.
[02:19:29.920 --> 02:19:35.640]  But he's a Peace Prize winner, so it's okay. Martin Luther King Jr. High School coach shoots
[02:19:35.640 --> 02:19:43.320]  attackers WKYZ, very exciting news there out of Detroit. The armed men came who've been
[02:19:43.320 --> 02:19:46.240]  picking on the girls and threatening them, so he escorted them out.
[02:19:46.240 --> 02:19:50.400]  And when they came up with their guns to attack the young women reportedly, he dealt with
[02:19:50.400 --> 02:19:55.760]  them. There you go. How dare that, coach? Protect those young women. I mean, he should
[02:19:55.760 --> 02:19:59.820]  be more gelded. I mean, you shouldn't have men out there that want to protect young girls.
[02:19:59.820 --> 02:20:02.840]  How evil is that?
[02:20:02.840 --> 02:20:08.360]  You land in Buenos Aires, then a shuttle to Santa Rosa, where a nicely furnished cabin

[02:22:00.380 --> 02:22:04.560]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth
[02:22:04.560 --> 02:22:09.580]  to retire and live out their golden years. Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost
[02:22:09.580 --> 02:22:14.720]  of food, energy, housing and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty
[02:22:14.720 --> 02:22:18.760]  line. Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve
[02:22:18.760 --> 02:22:23.880]  Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes? These questions
[02:22:23.880 --> 02:22:28.320]  and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:22:28.320 --> 02:22:32.560]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank

[02:23:57.600 --> 02:24:08.960]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central. We're here back Sundays four to
[02:24:08.960 --> 02:24:14.220]  six with the Sunday radio transmission four to six central. Nightly News, seven o'clock
[02:24:14.220 --> 02:24:19.800]  central every night streaming out at prisonplanet.tv and infowarsnews.com. I'm Alex Jones, your
[02:24:19.800 --> 02:24:20.800]  host.
[02:24:20.800 --> 02:24:23.800]  I'm going to start going to your phone calls. You know, I saw this this morning and I must
[02:24:23.800 --> 02:24:29.360]  have mentally suppressed it. It should have been our top story. And I just didn't cover
[02:24:29.360 --> 02:24:35.600]  it. Because I saw it this morning, I heard the guys talk about the start of the show
[02:24:35.600 --> 02:24:39.080]  and it's like my brain's actually protecting me from things now.
[02:24:39.080 --> 02:24:43.360]  I just didn't register it because I don't like Janet Napolitano. I know what she did
[02:24:43.360 --> 02:24:49.040]  in Arizona, the open borders, the corruption, what a pig she is, the bizarre stuff she's
[02:24:49.040 --> 02:24:53.720]  done at the Justice Department to men. I mean, this is a monstrous woman. Big sis is drudged
[02:24:53.720 --> 02:25:00.720]  just dubbed her. And now she will decide what happens with the borders, not the law, not
[02:25:00.720 --> 02:25:01.720]  the Constitution.
[02:25:01.720 --> 02:25:05.640]  No, she will decide if we have any border security or not. They've already got the Border
[02:25:05.640 --> 02:25:13.960]  Patrol down there harassing Americans drinking beer. I've seen it. We pay the government,
[02:25:13.960 --> 02:25:17.040]  they won't even let people go sit on the Rio Grande occurs light. I've watched him do it
[02:25:17.040 --> 02:25:25.440]  to people. And then now this monster who was involved in Fast and Furious, they're talking
[02:25:25.440 --> 02:25:30.160]  about her running for president.
[02:25:30.160 --> 02:25:34.920]  They're pushing in the Washington Post, you name it. She could be the one. I mean, give
[02:25:34.920 --> 02:25:45.960]  me a break. Janet Reno clone, come on. Is there no end to it? What a monster. And they'll
[02:25:45.960 --> 02:25:52.200]  stage the election, the voting machine, she'll probably end up being a new emperor.
[02:25:52.200 --> 02:25:55.520]  I wonder if she'll make all the men in America go live in the bathroom like they do at the
[02:25:55.520 --> 02:26:02.560]  Justice Department. They settled those cases, a bunch of crazy, weird women raging around.
[02:26:02.560 --> 02:26:08.800]  A lot of them take testosterone. So they're like men, but they're crazy. And they just
[02:26:08.800 --> 02:26:12.720]  absolutely call the men in and let them know they're the scum of the earth.
[02:26:12.720 --> 02:26:17.400]  Just can you imagine living under these women? This country is in so much trouble cuz we
[02:26:17.400 --> 02:26:22.300]  just put up with all this baloney. I mean, there's got to be an end to it. There's got
[02:26:22.300 --> 02:26:28.880]  to be an end to it. Let's go to your phone calls. Let's go to Nick in Ireland. Nick in
[02:26:28.880 --> 02:26:30.920]  good old Ireland. How you doing today?
[02:26:30.920 --> 02:26:36.240]  Hey, how's it going? Pretty good, sir. Thanks for holding. Welcome.
[02:26:36.240 --> 02:26:43.120]  Hi, not too bad. How's yourself? I got home 2.30, surfed the internet till about 3.30.
[02:26:43.120 --> 02:26:47.280]  Kids woke me up about 6.30. Four-year-old came in and turned the light on. So I actually
[02:26:47.280 --> 02:26:50.160]  feel pretty darn good. It's almost like I'm high off not having any sleep.
[02:26:50.160 --> 02:26:53.920]  You had a normal day then, eh? Well, not quite, but yeah.
[02:26:53.920 --> 02:26:59.080]  Okay, if you don't mind, I just had a couple of quick questions. I just can't seem to get
[02:26:59.080 --> 02:27:04.120]  any clarification on. Well, go ahead, brother.
[02:27:04.120 --> 02:27:10.560]  Well, first thing, everyone's seen all the coverage from the hostage situation in Algeria,
[02:27:10.560 --> 02:27:15.800]  right? But I've never heard anyone ask the question for the potential as to how many
[02:27:15.800 --> 02:27:22.760]  of the militants actually killed hostages using weapons that came from the embassy in
[02:27:22.760 --> 02:27:23.760]  Benghazi.
[02:27:23.760 --> 02:27:28.400]  Well, that's just like fast and furious. I mean, it's not just Benghazi. Our government
[02:27:28.400 --> 02:27:32.840]  is run by foreign banks who armed al-Qaeda in Libya and Syria and gave them missiles,
[02:27:32.840 --> 02:27:37.120]  heat-seeking missiles. And they're invading all these African countries. And it's in the
[02:27:37.120 --> 02:27:41.760]  news going, yeah, it's blond-haired, blue-eyed guys that were at the refinery and had the
[02:27:41.760 --> 02:27:42.760]  hostages.
[02:27:42.760 --> 02:27:46.100]  And then they pulled out, then the troops came in. It's a simulant. If you wanna invade
[02:27:46.100 --> 02:27:51.080]  a country now, Hitler attacked his own bases on the Polish border in Operation Himmler
[02:27:51.080 --> 02:27:57.700]  at Gilets. And it's the oldest trick in the book. It's like Turkey going over and firing
[02:27:57.700 --> 02:28:02.200]  rockets back at itself for mortars to be able to then take part of Syria.
[02:28:02.200 --> 02:28:06.440]  And Israel's taking part of Syria. And it's like, for our safety, we're taking part cuz
[02:28:06.440 --> 02:28:11.840]  the rebels might attack us. And then meanwhile, the rebels are who the West put in. The West
[02:28:11.840 --> 02:28:17.720]  started this in Syria, and the public is in such a coma that they're just like, what?
[02:28:17.720 --> 02:28:26.120]  Good, I'm glad. Kill Assad, he's with al-Qaeda. And it's just like, look, it's entered Twilight
[02:28:26.120 --> 02:28:31.000]  Zone level because they know about half the population does not know how to find their
[02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:32.680]  rear end with both hands.
[02:28:32.680 --> 02:28:36.440]  Yeah, unfortunately, most people are all like, what? Obama.
[02:28:36.440 --> 02:28:42.960]  Obama, Obama. I can't even do it, my voice is so shot. Let me try it. Obama, I can't
[02:28:42.960 --> 02:28:43.960]  even do it.
[02:28:43.960 --> 02:28:52.200]  Yeah, you're pretty good. Here, right, second thing. We're sick of what the Obama administration
[02:28:52.200 --> 02:28:53.200]  is doing.
[02:28:53.200 --> 02:28:54.200]  Obama, Obama.
[02:28:54.200 --> 02:29:03.280]  Sorry, go ahead, sorry. So Rand Paul had Hillary Clinton right where your movement needed her
[02:29:03.280 --> 02:29:09.200]  last week. And we, the rest of the world, are sick of what the Obama administration
[02:29:09.200 --> 02:29:12.280]  is doing to your country's image in the world stage.
[02:29:12.280 --> 02:29:16.880]  He knows exactly what happened in Benghazi. He treated her with kid gloves. He could have
[02:29:16.880 --> 02:29:22.520]  exposed everything on live TV and got the ball rolling, but gave her a pass. One can
[02:29:22.520 --> 02:29:28.240]  only surmise as to why. I'm pretty sure if Ron Paul was asking the questions, they might
[02:29:28.240 --> 02:29:29.240]  have been a little bit different.
[02:29:29.240 --> 02:29:34.200]  Look, here's why Congress kisses the butt of Homeland Security. People like Hillary
[02:29:34.200 --> 02:29:39.600]  Clinton. Hillary Clinton is a mobster gangster with a lot of notches on her belt. And let
[02:29:39.600 --> 02:29:44.120]  me tell you something, these people don't play games. Most people are scared. And that's
[02:29:44.120 --> 02:29:50.360]  why we're being enslaved. I mean, you know, the spectacle of me being on air is a miracle.
[02:29:50.360 --> 02:30:01.080]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.080 --> 02:30:06.240]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers. The prognosis for the entire planetary
[02:30:06.240 --> 02:30:11.840]  economic system runs from bad to worse. The globalist model is to shut down societies
[02:30:11.840 --> 02:30:17.000]  and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover. That's why we've assembled
[02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:22.520]  the most vital and important preparedness items at InfowarsShop.com. These are items

[02:33:15.600 --> 02:33:19.680]  right, we're gonna go right back to your calls and I'm gonna give you some more news.
[02:33:19.680 --> 02:33:27.080]  But during the break, CJ and I were just marveling. Imagine having Janet Napolitano as the president.
[02:33:27.080 --> 02:33:31.840]  We know they're puppets, we know they're front people. But still, they're nasty ringwraiths
[02:33:31.840 --> 02:33:37.320]  of the globalist. I mean, they're servants of serious corruption. And that's why you
[02:33:37.320 --> 02:33:41.080]  got the Republicans getting in line, the leadership, they wanna see it at that trough, that bloody
[02:33:41.080 --> 02:33:45.560]  trough of our money and our name that's being destroyed worldwide.
[02:33:45.560 --> 02:33:51.740]  And they're just moving forward. And it's because of the spectacle of TV and the modern
[02:33:51.740 --> 02:33:56.200]  bread and circuses and the adulteration of the food and water. The public is so dumbed
[02:33:56.200 --> 02:34:02.680]  down. Here's some of the articles, news articles up at prisonplanet.com. North Korea may stage
[02:34:02.680 --> 02:34:06.520]  multiple nuclear tests. I mean, look at that image. That's the greatest image if you're
[02:34:06.520 --> 02:34:11.640]  watching on TV of government tyranny. A little soft nobody who never did anything, never
[02:34:11.640 --> 02:34:17.060]  carried out the trash, never got in a fistfight, I mean, cuz they've got dossiers on him trained
[02:34:17.060 --> 02:34:20.800]  in Switzerland, where they sent him away.
[02:34:20.800 --> 02:34:25.720]  The dictator of a country, just there it is, there's government. That's what it is. That's
[02:34:25.720 --> 02:34:31.120]  where it leads. A little Caligula. The world is heading into World War III, got a Gerald
[02:34:31.120 --> 02:34:36.100]  Salente interview up there. Arizona students suspended for having a gun screensaver. Again,
[02:34:36.100 --> 02:34:40.640]  it's the introduction of thought crime. Charlottesville, Virginia, that's First Amendment, folks, not
[02:34:40.640 --> 02:34:42.000]  threatening anybody.
[02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:48.560]  Charlottesville, Virginia becomes first US city to ban government spy drones. US Marine
[02:34:48.560 --> 02:34:54.520]  questions narrative behind Chris Kyle murder. That's breaking exclusive news. We have an
[02:34:54.520 --> 02:34:58.840]  exclusive photo of the supposed shooter who was a mechanic from Marines inside saying
[02:34:58.840 --> 02:35:04.520]  he didn't see any combat. They think it's all staged. Japan says China aimed military
[02:35:04.520 --> 02:35:11.080]  radar at ship, which can hurt people, by the way, author and former intelligence contract
[02:35:11.080 --> 02:35:13.640]  pilot accused in murder suicide.
[02:35:13.640 --> 02:35:18.980]  Getting rid of taking out the people you don't wanna know and have information. America's
[02:35:18.980 --> 02:35:24.680]  next vigilantes, and it goes into Mexico having vigilantes that are actually restoring order
[02:35:24.680 --> 02:35:29.840]  in some areas. The video of where I confront in a friendly way, but it gets a little testy
[02:35:29.840 --> 02:35:33.040]  cuz Pierce couldn't help himself yesterday.
[02:35:33.040 --> 02:35:37.200]  In the scenes there at the shooting range, Ted Nugent in the video clip saying that Piers
[02:35:37.200 --> 02:35:41.360]  Morgan is full of crap, needs to leave gun owners the hell alone. That's up there. Piers
[02:35:41.360 --> 02:35:47.240]  Morgan reveals astonishing ignorance and claim. The commercial airplanes are gun free zones
[02:35:47.240 --> 02:35:53.000]  when we've worked to get the pilots re-armed again. Just amazing. So that's just some of
[02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:55.920]  the news up at prisonplanet.com.
[02:35:55.920 --> 02:35:59.760]  And there's a lot of the same news on Prison Planet. There is on infowars.com, but sometimes
[02:35:59.760 --> 02:36:05.080]  infowars.com might go down, so Prison Planet's the mirror. But there's also a lot of exclusive
[02:36:05.080 --> 02:36:13.240]  stuff over there, so it's not exactly a mirror at prisonplanet.com, so an important URL destination.
[02:36:13.240 --> 02:36:17.380]  And remember, they don't want this information getting out. They admitted to me, off record
[02:36:17.380 --> 02:36:23.680]  but also on record, and we've got some of this on video, that they got the highest ratings
[02:36:23.680 --> 02:36:25.400]  Piers Morgan has had in two years.
[02:36:25.400 --> 02:36:33.120]  I mean, he's had former presidents on, and he's had movie stars on, and he's had stupid
[02:36:33.120 --> 02:36:39.480]  royalty on. People are sick of it. And I go in there and get in his face, and for several
[02:36:39.480 --> 02:36:46.240]  weeks, he had the highest ratings he's ever had. Now, why is that? It's because people
[02:36:46.240 --> 02:36:49.860]  want reality, and people can tell I'm real.
[02:36:49.860 --> 02:36:55.360]  For whatever reason, you bet, I'm real. Blood, feathers, warts, guts, the whole nine yards,
[02:36:55.360 --> 02:37:04.840]  I'm real. And that's why I know, I mean, I know if they put me on national television
[02:37:04.840 --> 02:37:09.920]  with a produced news show covering real issues, it would be the number one show in this country.
[02:37:09.920 --> 02:37:15.980]  Not just news, but number one period. I mean, I got the ratings from 590 AM on the Sunday
[02:37:15.980 --> 02:37:27.160]  show that they carry, and it is number one in all radio in Austin period by massive numbers.
[02:37:27.160 --> 02:37:30.120]  Now that they have the instant meters where it's actually who's listening, I mean, it's
[02:37:30.120 --> 02:37:34.880]  just our ratings are everywhere they've put me up against Rush Limbaugh, I've beaten him.
[02:37:34.880 --> 02:37:39.000]  But it doesn't matter, then ESPN comes and buys the station or somebody else does. It's
[02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:42.640]  incredible to watch these talk show hosts. Now, Limbaugh basically built himself in the
[02:37:42.640 --> 02:37:47.920]  beginning, but other talk show hosts, they're just given, here, here's Clear Channel and
[02:37:47.920 --> 02:37:52.740]  Premier, we'll just put you on all this, here, boom, you get it.
[02:37:52.740 --> 02:37:56.200]  It doesn't matter if you beat them in the ratings, it doesn't matter, that's not what
[02:37:56.200 --> 02:38:01.080]  it's about. They don't want this show getting out there, but it doesn't matter, it's on
[02:38:01.080 --> 02:38:08.160]  latest numbers around 150 stations. And that is a huge thing for a broadcast like this,
[02:38:08.160 --> 02:38:10.360]  and a lot of them are big stations, a lot are mom and pops.
[02:38:10.360 --> 02:38:15.080]  I wanna thank all those affiliates. And it's so important to spread the word, if you're
[02:38:15.080 --> 02:38:20.880]  listening to this on AM or FM station, this is a big deal. That in 17 years, I, with my
[02:38:20.880 --> 02:38:27.040]  listeners' support, have been able to crawl up to this point, literally from access television,
[02:38:27.040 --> 02:38:31.120]  from the basement, self-trained, self-taught, and I'm nobody special.
[02:38:31.120 --> 02:38:34.720]  But they were coming for my guns, they were taking farmer's property, they were harassing
[02:38:34.720 --> 02:38:39.240]  old people with zoning laws, I decided to do something. And I'm telling you, if you
[02:38:39.240 --> 02:38:43.760]  get involved and take action against these people, you will bring them down. But if you
[02:38:43.760 --> 02:38:45.900]  bend over, they're gonna run over you.
[02:38:45.900 --> 02:38:51.520]  If you lay down with these people, it's bad news. Rediscover the American spirit. If you're
[02:38:51.520 --> 02:38:56.620]  listening on AM or FM stations, folks, I'm telling you, and a lot of people do this,
[02:38:56.620 --> 02:39:01.480]  put a big sign, especially if you're on the highway. Go get the plywood, paint it white,
[02:39:01.480 --> 02:39:05.920]  and put the affiliate and the station.
[02:39:05.920 --> 02:39:12.760]  And when I'm on, learn the truth, this station, Alex Jones. People have done this over the
[02:39:12.760 --> 02:39:17.020]  years. We don't have the big monopoly like some of the outfits that also own the big
[02:39:17.020 --> 02:39:21.720]  billboard companies so they can advertise their own stuff. But patriots have put up
[02:39:21.720 --> 02:39:27.800]  billboards all over the country, plugging infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, and stations
[02:39:27.800 --> 02:39:28.800]  we're on.
[02:39:28.800 --> 02:39:34.040]  I mean, listen, it's a big deal. And if we're on a local station, if you went and stood
[02:39:34.040 --> 02:39:38.800]  on the street corner and handed out 100 paper printouts of when my show's on, what's happening,
[02:39:38.800 --> 02:39:42.040]  I guarantee you 20, 30 people you hand that out to are gonna tune in, they're gonna probably
[02:39:42.040 --> 02:39:43.080]  wake up.
[02:39:43.080 --> 02:39:46.120]  I can't tell you how many listeners, when I've done this with calls, ask, how did you
[02:39:46.120 --> 02:39:51.360]  wake up? Somebody told me to go to infowars.com. I saw a bumper sticker. I saw it written on
[02:39:51.360 --> 02:39:55.920]  the bathroom wall. I saw it written on a dollar bill, a Federal Reserve note. It's not really
[02:39:55.920 --> 02:39:59.880]  a dollar bill. See, we have to change the language here.
[02:39:59.880 --> 02:40:05.600]  And that's how infowars.com and prisonplanet.com is getting out there. And like it or not,
[02:40:05.600 --> 02:40:11.040]  we're the most effective, most aggressive voice out there to push the envelope. Let
[02:40:11.040 --> 02:40:16.600]  me tell you, I hear stuff on all the big mainline neocon shows that they weren't talking about
[02:40:16.600 --> 02:40:19.400]  two years ago that's right out of my mouth.
[02:40:19.400 --> 02:40:23.480]  So my talking points, which aren't talking points, it's what I've researched, what I've
[02:40:23.480 --> 02:40:29.280]  seen, what the globalists have said they're doing. The real power of this show is not
[02:40:29.280 --> 02:40:34.160]  the 600 million views or whatever it is now on YouTube one way or another. It's not the
[02:40:34.160 --> 02:40:39.680]  150 AM and FM stations. It's not the global shortwave. It's not the 500 something thousand
[02:40:39.680 --> 02:40:42.440]  in the podcast every day free.
[02:40:42.440 --> 02:40:48.400]  That's all important. It is that you are talking, others are talking, and even if they don't
[02:40:48.400 --> 02:40:56.520]  give me credit, which doesn't matter, the signal's getting out there. And it's really
[02:40:56.520 --> 02:41:05.080]  starting to turn the tide. And my point is we've got a chance to beat these people. All
[02:41:05.080 --> 02:41:09.160]  right, I'm gonna shut up and go hear calls. Shut up, Jones, you never shut up.
[02:41:09.160 --> 02:41:14.280]  Let's go, I'm joking, I don't talk to myself. Maybe when I'm sleep deprived, I do. Let's
[02:41:14.280 --> 02:41:21.280]  go to Julio in Illinois. You're on the air listening on 1530 WCKG in Chicago. Go ahead.
[02:41:21.280 --> 02:41:30.440]  Yeah, it's funny, I was watching some tube today and it's astonishing to see the military
[02:41:30.440 --> 02:41:38.320]  in Baltimore, the streets of Baltimore, celebrating with the football team. Military RVs and the
[02:41:38.320 --> 02:41:40.440]  Super Bowl trophy going through the streets of Baltimore.
[02:41:40.440 --> 02:41:45.240]  No, no, it's all done as a psy-op to acclimate you to troops on the streets, the drills,
[02:41:45.240 --> 02:41:50.080]  the Kentucky Derby. I forgot that, yeah, at the end of the Super Bowl, the troops celebrating,
[02:41:50.080 --> 02:41:55.760]  hey, we associate the Super Bowl with troops in the street. Yeah, it's happening. Here's
[02:41:55.760 --> 02:42:00.000]  the question, what are they getting ready for that they've done slow acclamation, now
[02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:02.120]  they're going full bore?
[02:42:02.120 --> 02:42:06.560]  I think it's gonna be something massive. I think it's going to be some sort of false
[02:42:06.560 --> 02:42:15.720]  flag. There's a FBI Homeland Security document where they are concerned about people infiltrating
[02:42:15.720 --> 02:42:21.360]  Homeland Security or TSA and letting some sort of bomb go through. It's astonishing.
[02:42:21.360 --> 02:42:26.240]  What I wanted to bring up was these smart meters here in Naperville, not too far where
[02:42:26.240 --> 02:42:32.560]  I live. I actually interviewed the lady who had the thugs of the power company go in and
[02:42:32.560 --> 02:42:36.280]  install the smart meters. It's astonishing what they're doing to these people here in
[02:42:36.280 --> 02:42:42.120]  Naperville. It's truly astonishing. It's just another example that this green authoritarianism
[02:42:42.120 --> 02:42:49.040]  is just gonna tell us what to do, what we can do in our homes.
[02:42:49.040 --> 02:42:52.200]  It's really astonishing what's going on.
[02:42:52.200 --> 02:42:55.240]  Well I'm glad you interviewed her. Yeah, you've done work with We Are Changer, a journalist,
[02:42:55.240 --> 02:42:58.240]  you do a great job, Julio. I know you call him from time to time. We've got her actually
[02:42:58.240 --> 02:43:04.600]  on the broadcast tomorrow. They arrested the neighbor cuz she called her over for help.
[02:43:04.600 --> 02:43:09.600]  People forgot and then they arrested her the day later for putting it on YouTube out in
[02:43:09.600 --> 02:43:13.680]  the street, videoing the police. And it doesn't matter how many times it gets thrown out of
[02:43:13.680 --> 02:43:16.600]  court, they just wanna take you to jail.
[02:43:16.600 --> 02:43:21.200]  I mean, the government is completely out of control. And what is it about Illinois? Cuz
[02:43:21.200 --> 02:43:25.560]  I gotta be honest with you, my cousin lives up there. Everybody I've met from Illinois
[02:43:25.560 --> 02:43:30.280]  who's been down here when I've been up to Illinois are really cool, nice, smart people
[02:43:30.280 --> 02:43:32.760]  who actually know the government's corrupt and are awake.
[02:43:32.760 --> 02:43:39.120]  So where's the paradox of everybody, literally, I've ever met from Illinois is really nice.
[02:43:39.120 --> 02:43:43.560]  It's like the cliche of Canadians being nice or Texans being nice. But then the governments
[02:43:43.560 --> 02:43:46.520]  are so horrible. What happened up there?
[02:43:46.520 --> 02:43:50.680]  I have no idea to be honest with you, Alex. You're right, everyone is, for the most part,
[02:43:50.680 --> 02:43:56.040]  pretty nice to themselves, tight knit family, oriented people around the suburbs. But we
[02:43:56.040 --> 02:44:02.400]  just have these truth thugs come in and take over everything. And now we have Rahm Emanuel,
[02:44:02.400 --> 02:44:06.880]  a true coward, the Napoleon of the 21st century, as I like to call him.
[02:44:06.880 --> 02:44:12.560]  He's really going to tear Chicago into just a crime-ridden city.
[02:44:12.560 --> 02:44:17.280]  And they do it on purpose. They do it on purpose. Everybody's in fear, they've taken the guns.
[02:44:17.280 --> 02:44:22.360]  And then they blame the whole country that they have 530 something murders a year. But
[02:44:22.360 --> 02:44:25.680]  they're admitting the police don't even investigate murder from what I've read. You can just kill
[02:44:25.680 --> 02:44:30.000]  whoever you want in Chicago as long as it's not a made man.
[02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:34.320]  It's a place for criminals to feed. And the only reason why it's not getting national
[02:44:34.320 --> 02:44:39.440]  attention is because most of the crimes in the south and west side of Chicago happen
[02:44:39.440 --> 02:44:44.360]  with the drug war, happen with the gangs. Majority of them get their money in the black
[02:44:44.360 --> 02:44:45.360]  market from the drug war.
[02:44:45.360 --> 02:44:49.520]  It's just like Mexico. If you decriminalize the drugs, it never would have happened. Now
[02:44:49.520 --> 02:44:53.720]  it's so bad, even if you decriminalize, the criminal culture's so big, they're just gonna
[02:44:53.720 --> 02:44:58.200]  move into other stuff. And we see kidnapping and all the things third world countries have
[02:44:58.200 --> 02:45:02.600]  coming here because the criminal culture of government, God bless you, Julio.
[02:45:02.600 --> 02:45:07.680]  Let's talk to Deborah in Florida, DHS and Bank of America. Yeah, Bank of America's telling
[02:45:07.680 --> 02:45:11.120]  gun shops, you name it, it's confirmed. We don't want your business. What happened to
[02:45:11.120 --> 02:45:12.120]  you, Deborah?
[02:45:12.120 --> 02:45:19.480]  Hi, basically, as far as Bank of America, I saw a video on YouTube where this woman
[02:45:19.480 --> 02:45:25.160]  made the phone call, put the phone down by the camera, and you heard the whole thing.
[02:45:25.160 --> 02:45:32.120]  She says, I went to buy ammunition, and I've been told that any guns and ammunition sales,
[02:45:32.120 --> 02:45:36.960]  are not banning payments. Is this true? And they said yes, they broke my mind, I couldn't
[02:45:36.960 --> 02:45:37.960]  believe it.
[02:45:37.960 --> 02:45:41.280]  Yeah, they're not letting people buy guns, and they're keeping it quiet. But I had a
[02:45:41.280 --> 02:45:47.240]  major gun dealer on two years ago, a gun manufacturer. We had him on the show, I forget who it was.
[02:45:47.240 --> 02:45:53.520]  Guys, get me some news on that. Type in gun manufacturer has his Bank of America account
[02:45:53.520 --> 02:45:58.760]  suspended or terminated. And they called him in and they said, we told you six months ago
[02:45:58.760 --> 02:46:02.320]  we don't like this, and so we're terminating your account. It was a pretty big company,
[02:46:02.320 --> 02:46:04.480]  I had him on.
[02:46:04.480 --> 02:46:09.280]  It's just wild. I mean, Rahm Emanuel said, Banks, lean on them. They're gonna control
[02:46:09.280 --> 02:46:13.480]  what you can purchase now with your money legally and lawfully. I haven't seen that
[02:46:13.480 --> 02:46:17.760]  YouTube video, tell me about it. What's the name of it?
[02:46:17.760 --> 02:46:22.560]  I don't remember off the top of my head, it's just a woman who called in and she puts the
[02:46:22.560 --> 02:46:28.040]  phone down on the desk and you hear the whole thing. And it's like, my goodness, I couldn't
[02:46:28.040 --> 02:46:32.880]  believe it. And then similar, somebody else who puts out a lot of political videos where
[02:46:32.880 --> 02:46:38.620]  everything has come to fruition, it's all truth. One video he put out that was kind
[02:46:38.620 --> 02:46:45.240]  of astonishing, it said that all DHS is trained to take away all authorities from sheriffs
[02:46:45.240 --> 02:46:51.040]  around the country, state to state. Arresting powers, everything, and they started with
[02:46:51.040 --> 02:46:56.440]  Delaware and they completed with Delaware. And something about Joe Biden's son being
[02:46:56.440 --> 02:47:00.000]  in office there, I don't know if that's true, if that has anything to do with it.
[02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:06.560]  But they're doing it so under the radar. Now, is this true? I don't know. But usually everything
[02:47:06.560 --> 02:47:11.160]  that I've seen from this guy's videos have been just all mainstream.
[02:47:11.160 --> 02:47:16.200]  Look, look, look, they're doing it all. Bank of America, and we actually found the article,
[02:47:16.200 --> 02:47:20.360]  let's punch it up at CNS News. Let's punch that one up first. Bank of America freezes
[02:47:20.360 --> 02:47:26.120]  gun makers account. Yeah, that was, this is a new article. I guess this happened to a
[02:47:26.120 --> 02:47:29.160]  new group cuz I had a fella on a couple years ago.
[02:47:29.160 --> 02:47:33.000]  Bank of America's reportedly frozen the account of gun manufacturer American Spirit Arms.
[02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:41.000]  According to its owner, Joe, how do you pronounce that? Serkimin, Sermokimin, in a Facebook
[02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:45.760]  post dated the 29th. So yeah, that's a new one. So let's see, we looked and found another
[02:47:45.760 --> 02:47:46.760]  company.
[02:47:46.760 --> 02:47:50.360]  Now let's go to the Daily Caller. Bank of America credit debit cards not blocked from
[02:47:50.360 --> 02:47:55.780]  purchasing guns ammunition. So they're now denying that and I'm sorry, I've just seen
[02:47:55.780 --> 02:48:04.920]  Bank of America do this over and over again. Well, let me just type in, banks, take Time
[02:48:04.920 --> 02:48:09.240]  Warner. They won't let you run a sporting, fishing, shooting store ad on their local
[02:48:09.240 --> 02:48:10.240]  cable channels.
[02:48:10.240 --> 02:48:15.160]  They won't let you run it in their publications. They won't let you run it on their AOL. I
[02:48:15.160 --> 02:48:22.160]  mean, that was announced a month ago. They're canceling gun shows on TV that are hit shows.
[02:48:22.160 --> 02:48:26.920]  It's all over the place that big banks are not taking gun manufacturers or sellers business
[02:48:26.920 --> 02:48:29.500]  and trying to lean on smaller banks not to.
[02:48:29.500 --> 02:48:33.400]  And then, but none of that's happening. Again, we don't want your guns. We just got bills
[02:48:33.400 --> 02:48:37.240]  introduced to take them. It's the same tactic over and over again. Thank you, Deborah. Chris,
[02:48:37.240 --> 02:48:39.360]  in Florida, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:48:39.360 --> 02:48:44.360]  Well, Alex, it seems like the best way to deal with these county commissioners here
[02:48:44.360 --> 02:48:49.480]  in Pinellas County who are so obstinate when it comes to listening to the people, a super
[02:48:49.480 --> 02:48:54.180]  majority that we had this past November when they voted the fluoridation of the water back
[02:48:54.180 --> 02:48:56.480]  in effective March 1st.
[02:48:56.480 --> 02:49:00.960]  Seems like a political action committee might be the best way to go because we
[02:49:00.960 --> 02:49:05.000]  I hear you for those that don't know, Pinellas County voted it out, but then special interest
[02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:08.240]  came in and voted it back in. And you have the Harvard studies and all of them saying
[02:49:08.240 --> 02:49:11.600]  bone cancer, brain damage, deadly doesn't help your teeth.
[02:49:11.600 --> 02:49:16.280]  You need to sue them. You need to sue them. You need to sue them for fraud, taking special
[02:49:16.280 --> 02:49:20.600]  interest money to then make you buy toxic waste to put in your water. Just get aggressive.
[02:49:20.600 --> 02:49:24.280]  Thanks for the call. Let's go to Allen, Delaware. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:49:24.280 --> 02:49:29.680]  Well, you're right, Alex. We're going to have to get left. You know, one thing I love about
[02:49:29.680 --> 02:49:33.680]  being a righteous American and I have a lot of rage, which is righteous American group
[02:49:33.680 --> 02:49:40.160]  enhancement is we're never vulgar, but we're always right. You know, I always echo. I listen
[02:49:40.160 --> 02:49:44.960]  to your show every like I said, haven't missed many in five years. You're like the son I
[02:49:44.960 --> 02:49:49.600]  never had. You got, you know, you helped me get my house because this, they had the Patriot
[02:49:49.600 --> 02:49:50.600]  Act.
[02:49:50.600 --> 02:49:54.800]  Now they have healthcare and every day I go after your show, I call a couple of radio
[02:49:54.800 --> 02:50:00.200]  stations and I air it out and people are still in disbelief. Back off your phone a little
[02:50:00.200 --> 02:50:05.920]  bit. Back off your phone. It's over driving. Oh, I'm saying that I do get a chance to talk
[02:50:05.920 --> 02:50:11.320]  on air. I repeat what you say every day and the word is getting out, but it's getting
[02:50:11.320 --> 02:50:16.880]  out slowly. The problem we really have is that people are so watered down and dumbed
[02:50:16.880 --> 02:50:22.760]  down by mainstream, some people got freaked out by me telling peers, don't try to take
[02:50:22.760 --> 02:50:23.760]  our guns.
[02:50:23.760 --> 02:50:27.640]  I know you want to disarm us and I'm sick of your fraud. I mean, imagine if we have
[02:50:27.640 --> 02:50:32.360]  people like that in 1776, we never would have gotten off the ground. We have been brainwashed
[02:50:32.360 --> 02:50:41.000]  and put into this little subservient cheerleader mode and it is absolutely disgusting. We got
[02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:44.640]  to shake people out of their coma. I want to tell everybody something out there. If
[02:50:44.640 --> 02:50:49.680]  you're a new listener, we will lose everything. The globalist plan that got this country in
[02:50:49.680 --> 02:50:54.760]  an accelerated program with a Homeland Security Gestapo, if we don't get aggressive, okay,
[02:50:54.760 --> 02:50:57.120]  I mean, we are all in grave danger.
[02:50:57.120 --> 02:51:01.240]  They're coming to take everything away. Do you understand?
[02:51:01.240 --> 02:51:05.980]  Attention gardeners and Patriots drought conditions in our nation's heartland and massive Federal
[02:51:05.980 --> 02:51:10.920]  Reserve debt monetizing are creating the perfect conditions for dramatically higher food prices.
[02:51:10.920 --> 02:51:15.920]  In the months ahead, that means there has never been a better time to secure an ongoing
[02:51:15.920 --> 02:51:20.480]  source of nutritionally dense food for you and your family. The survival seed bank contains

[02:52:01.380 --> 02:52:06.920]  We travel so much and having a fake TV gives added peace of mind.
[02:52:06.920 --> 02:52:12.800]  Burglars look for houses that appear to be easy targets, but fake TV can fool even professional
[02:52:12.800 --> 02:52:16.420]  burglars into thinking someone is home watching television.
[02:52:16.420 --> 02:52:21.480]  As a recent widow living alone, it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV near
[02:52:21.480 --> 02:52:25.960]  a window and know that passing motorists and pedestrians will think someone is home watching
[02:52:25.960 --> 02:52:28.980]  TV when I'm actually away from home.
[02:52:28.980 --> 02:52:33.640]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet, just like a light on a timer.
[02:52:33.640 --> 02:52:37.920]  They're so easy to use. You just plug them in and they're ready to go. Plus, they're
[02:52:37.920 --> 02:52:41.560]  so affordable that we have one upstairs and downstairs.
[02:52:41.560 --> 02:52:51.360]  Fake TV is only $34.95. Order your fake TV by calling 877-5FAKETV or go to faketv.com.
[02:52:51.360 --> 02:52:57.760]  That's 877-532-5388 or faketv.com.
[02:52:57.760 --> 02:53:00.280]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[02:53:00.280 --> 02:53:06.360]  Injuries, slow healing, aches and pains, constipation, weakness, fatigue are all common the older
[02:53:06.360 --> 02:53:07.360]  one gets.
[02:53:07.360 --> 02:53:10.840]  The progressive deterioration of the body that occurs almost universally, the older
[02:53:10.840 --> 02:53:16.640]  one gets, can partly to significantly be prevented with conscientious attention to nutrition.
[02:53:16.640 --> 02:53:20.880]  If the Hanza men can play rugby in their 90s, then it is possible for everyone in North
[02:53:20.880 --> 02:53:23.880]  America to experience a more youthful life as well.
[02:53:23.880 --> 02:53:28.080]  One key ingredient to warding off aging and reversing some of it is the type and quality
[02:53:28.080 --> 02:53:29.520]  of protein consumed.
[02:53:29.520 --> 02:53:34.840]  All protein foods or supplements you currently consume are heat damaged, destroying 50-75%
[02:53:34.840 --> 02:53:38.640]  of your ability to utilize the body building amino acids.
[02:53:38.640 --> 02:53:44.360]  One World Whey is not heat damaged and allows your body to utilize 100% of the amino acids.
[02:53:44.360 --> 02:53:46.740]  This feat no one else has achieved.
[02:53:46.740 --> 02:53:49.640]  The results to your health can be amazing.
[02:53:49.640 --> 02:53:52.160]  Call 888-988-3325.
[02:53:52.160 --> 02:53:54.940]  That's 888-988-3325.
[02:53:54.940 --> 02:54:00.000]  Or visit OneWorldWhey.com.
[02:54:24.940 --> 02:54:44.820]  Let's keep jamming in some more phone calls here.
[02:54:44.820 --> 02:54:50.640]  It is not my job to try to scare you or dumb you down or make you think it's all over.
[02:54:50.640 --> 02:54:51.640]  People it's the opposite.
[02:54:51.640 --> 02:54:55.240]  They just think, oh, the government loves me, or people are awake but think they don't
[02:54:55.240 --> 02:54:56.240]  have any power.
[02:54:56.240 --> 02:54:57.240]  You do have power.
[02:54:57.240 --> 02:54:59.480]  I mean, look at these articles I didn't even get to.
[02:54:59.480 --> 02:55:04.560]  Globalist funded think tank says poverty will save the planet, Kurt Nemo, InfoWars.com and
[02:55:04.560 --> 02:55:07.960]  it links to all the quotes about how they want to change our way of life and make us
[02:55:07.960 --> 02:55:10.360]  poor and how the state will run our lives.
[02:55:10.360 --> 02:55:13.520]  Here's another article out of the US News and World Report.
[02:55:13.520 --> 02:55:20.540]  Study, global warming can be slowed by working less and it goes on to say basically that
[02:55:20.540 --> 02:55:23.680]  being poor is a good way to save the earth.
[02:55:23.680 --> 02:55:27.880]  CIA rendition, more than a quarter of countries offered covert support.
[02:55:27.880 --> 02:55:30.680]  And that's just about pure corruption, fighting Al-Qaeda.
[02:55:30.680 --> 02:55:32.480]  They run Al-Qaeda.
[02:55:32.480 --> 02:55:33.560]  They just call it every group.
[02:55:33.560 --> 02:55:37.520]  They're slaughtering Al-Qaeda, but the real Al-Qaeda works for them.
[02:55:37.520 --> 02:55:38.920]  And you know, I've been proven right about that.
[02:55:38.920 --> 02:55:39.920]  Do I get an apology?
[02:55:39.920 --> 02:55:43.380]  Everybody's saying, how dare you say the government runs Al-Qaeda.
[02:55:43.380 --> 02:55:45.200]  It's on record they run the stinking group.
[02:55:45.200 --> 02:55:46.680]  It is not our government.
[02:55:46.680 --> 02:55:52.440]  It's a bunch of globalists.
[02:55:52.440 --> 02:55:55.280]  Mafia running all over us, I'm sick of it.
[02:55:55.280 --> 02:56:00.160]  And then they've got all these dozens and dozens of new taxes and Obamacare just runs
[02:56:00.160 --> 02:56:05.320]  our whole lives and the IRS runs it and all these new taxes to shut the economy down.
[02:56:05.320 --> 02:56:09.600]  I watch the economy shutting down and people going into poverty and the very criminals
[02:56:09.600 --> 02:56:13.000]  that are doing it up there, how they're trying to save us and how much they love us.
[02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:17.700]  They're a bunch of seedy, oily mafia crooks and I'm tired of them.
[02:56:17.700 --> 02:56:22.480]  And I hate watching the country get gutted while the new world order runs extermination
[02:56:22.480 --> 02:56:28.000]  operations in third world countries injecting little kids with live polio and meningitis
[02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:29.000]  killing them.
[02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:32.600]  They go into villages and shoot the kids up and like half of them die in a week.
[02:56:32.600 --> 02:56:34.380]  I saw articles about that last week.
[02:56:34.380 --> 02:56:35.380]  It wasn't even news.
[02:56:35.380 --> 02:56:36.880]  I didn't even cover it.
[02:56:36.880 --> 02:56:38.440]  Just it's just so old.
[02:56:38.440 --> 02:56:39.440]  More kids are murdering.
[02:56:39.440 --> 02:56:43.640]  I mean, you have to hear about how the UN's the good guy and how the UN loves this.
[02:56:43.640 --> 02:56:45.840]  I'll be walking through a store and I'll have a TV on.
[02:56:45.840 --> 02:56:49.080]  Miss America says she loves the UN and UNICEF.
[02:56:49.080 --> 02:56:54.380]  Just all this brainwashing, destroying our whole civilization, wrecking it.
[02:56:54.380 --> 02:57:02.480]  And they scientifically codify it into this baloney about, well, this is how we save the
[02:57:02.480 --> 02:57:03.480]  earth.
[02:57:03.480 --> 02:57:07.360]  They're actually putting their implosion system into a political paradigm because they know
[02:57:07.360 --> 02:57:09.180]  their tyranny will wreck the economy.
[02:57:09.180 --> 02:57:13.240]  So they go, we do it on purpose.
[02:57:13.240 --> 02:57:14.240]  It's what you do.
[02:57:14.240 --> 02:57:15.240]  I know that.
[02:57:15.240 --> 02:57:16.240]  John in Texas.
[02:57:16.240 --> 02:57:17.240]  You're on the air.
[02:57:17.240 --> 02:57:18.240]  Go ahead.
[02:57:18.240 --> 02:57:19.240]  This is John from Dallas, Texas.
[02:57:19.240 --> 02:57:24.080]  I called you about a month ago and I compared the government as to being our dog.
[02:57:24.080 --> 02:57:28.400]  I wanted to bring up a few points to you and all of the listeners.
[02:57:28.400 --> 02:57:33.480]  If you guys are a Ron Paul fan or a Liberty fan in general, you can go to Ron Paul's YouTube
[02:57:33.480 --> 02:57:39.360]  channel and the most recent speech he had is, in my opinion, one of the most powerful.
[02:57:39.360 --> 02:57:43.160]  It's not really a big crowd, so a lot of people don't know about it, but he basically touches
[02:57:43.160 --> 02:57:45.200]  on the second amendment and stuff like that.
[02:57:45.200 --> 02:57:48.440]  So if you and your crew and all the listeners want to go to that YouTube channel.
[02:57:48.440 --> 02:57:51.680]  The video's up on infoawards.com last time I checked.
[02:57:51.680 --> 02:57:55.520]  There's also a video of him talking about an article about him talking about what would
[02:57:55.520 --> 02:57:59.120]  Jesus do and then the neo cons all got really upset about it.
[02:57:59.120 --> 02:58:02.400]  Oh, you have the most recent one from January 26.
[02:58:02.400 --> 02:58:04.120]  I believe so, yeah.
[02:58:04.120 --> 02:58:05.120]  Okay.
[02:58:05.120 --> 02:58:11.880]  Another thing, this is a nation of Chris Kyle, our veteran that was still here in Texas.
[02:58:11.880 --> 02:58:18.880]  Whether you want to believe that that was a cover up or not, this is a huge deal for
[02:58:18.880 --> 02:58:24.640]  the government, for the new world order, because Chris Kyle was starting a civilian training
[02:58:24.640 --> 02:58:29.980]  course so that civilians would know how to defend themselves in case of tyranny or any
[02:58:29.980 --> 02:58:30.980]  other situation.
[02:58:30.980 --> 02:58:35.280]  Listen, I'm out of time, I'm out of time for this segment.
[02:58:35.280 --> 02:58:38.040]  By the way, I'm going to come back with a little bit of overdrive here.
[02:58:38.040 --> 02:58:40.960]  I need to get in the Bank of America.
[02:58:40.960 --> 02:58:46.240]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:58:51.240 --> 02:58:56.080]  Looking back on 2012, I know personally I'm thanking God that my family and I made it
[02:58:56.080 --> 02:59:00.040]  through the year from natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer
[02:59:00.040 --> 02:59:03.580]  drought to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy.
[02:59:03.580 --> 02:59:05.920]  Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.
[02:59:05.920 --> 02:59:10.120]  My friends at eFoods Direct hear from customers every day that are fortunate to weather life's

[02:59:12.360 --> 02:59:16.800]  Danny from New York City wrote in following Hurricane Sandy and said, almost all the grocery
[02:59:16.800 --> 02:59:20.800]  stores are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just in time to be able to help my
[02:59:20.800 --> 02:59:21.920]  sister and my niece.
[02:59:21.920 --> 02:59:26.040]  Bottom line, it's better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.

[03:00:05.920 --> 03:00:10.720]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[03:00:10.720 --> 03:00:11.720]  You want answers?
[03:00:11.720 --> 03:00:13.840]  Well, so does he.

[03:00:18.040 --> 03:00:22.480]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:22.480 --> 03:00:30.960]  You know, I meant to plug this during the main broadcast, but plug it tomorrow WHSY
[03:00:30.960 --> 03:00:37.680]  950 AM in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, live weekdays 12 noon to 2 PM carrying I guess two hours
[03:00:37.680 --> 03:00:38.880]  of the show.
[03:00:38.880 --> 03:00:46.240]  And that started yesterday, KIDO 580 AM Boise, Idaho, and it's tape delayed.
[03:00:46.240 --> 03:00:52.120]  They are at 7 PM to 10 PM central and that begins on my birthday, the 11th of February.
[03:00:52.120 --> 03:00:57.280]  I mean, I just every couple days they're bringing in new affiliates and this is just awesome.
[03:00:57.280 --> 03:00:58.280]  I don't even know how many.
[03:00:58.280 --> 03:01:00.160]  I know it's up to 150 or so.
[03:01:00.160 --> 03:01:01.480]  And for us, that's a big deal.
[03:01:01.480 --> 03:01:04.440]  That's a big deal.
[03:01:04.440 --> 03:01:06.960]  And look, I think they killed Chris Kyle.
[03:01:06.960 --> 03:01:13.480]  We've got articles up at Infowars.com right now, the most deadly US sniper, the Navy Seal.
[03:01:13.480 --> 03:01:17.600]  I mean, that killed him, he was gonna start a citizen sniper training.
[03:01:17.600 --> 03:01:20.320]  He was trying to get teachers armed.
[03:01:20.320 --> 03:01:23.060]  And I think he was put up to saying the stuff about Ventura and he wasn't gonna go along
[03:01:23.060 --> 03:01:26.860]  with that cuz I know people that know him and go shooting with him.
[03:01:26.860 --> 03:01:33.820]  And I've talked to him before on record on the Opie and Anthony show.
[03:01:33.820 --> 03:01:39.160]  And now this Marine that they say did this, story doesn't fit and it turns out he was
[03:01:39.160 --> 03:01:43.760]  never in combat from the reports we've got from Marines that knew him.
[03:01:43.760 --> 03:01:47.780]  He was a mechanic.
[03:01:47.780 --> 03:01:52.320]  So this is a pretty serious US Marine questions narrative behind Chris Kyle murder.
[03:01:52.320 --> 03:01:55.800]  And that's the Marine that gave us the info and proved who they were and gave us a real
[03:01:55.800 --> 03:01:56.800]  photo.
[03:01:56.800 --> 03:02:00.120]  In fact, you guys can click on the photo of people watching if you want to show them.
[03:02:00.120 --> 03:02:05.200]  Now there he is, there's the reported shooter in the Marines and that's the guy.
[03:02:05.200 --> 03:02:08.060]  And that was given to us by the Marines that took the photo.
[03:02:08.060 --> 03:02:11.900]  We get a Google search on that to even check the Marines.
[03:02:11.900 --> 03:02:13.160]  We are the people to post it.
[03:02:13.160 --> 03:02:15.080]  It's not somebody else's photo.
[03:02:15.080 --> 03:02:20.540]  So there it is right there, info.wars.com, presidentbondy.com.
[03:02:20.540 --> 03:02:21.860]  Big nightly news show tonight.
[03:02:21.860 --> 03:02:24.700]  It's gonna be live 7 o'clock central.
[03:02:24.700 --> 03:02:25.700]  Amazing job the crew's doing.
[03:02:25.700 --> 03:02:31.000]  We're gonna be doing the show live throughout the week so that we can learn how to, we've
[03:02:31.000 --> 03:02:35.360]  done it live before so we can get really good at doing it live, but also do it taped with
[03:02:35.360 --> 03:02:36.360]  special reports.
[03:02:36.360 --> 03:02:40.200]  We're gonna have a lot of behind the scenes from the protest against Piers Morgan.
[03:02:40.200 --> 03:02:42.040]  That's coming up as well.
[03:02:42.040 --> 03:02:44.560]  Let's talk to Daniel in Kentucky speaking of Piers Morgan.
[03:02:44.560 --> 03:02:45.560]  Go ahead, sir.
[03:02:45.560 --> 03:02:48.640]  Hey Alex, what have you been doing, buddy?
[03:02:48.640 --> 03:02:50.360]  Busting my butt fighting red codes.
[03:02:50.360 --> 03:02:51.360]  I hear that.
[03:02:51.360 --> 03:02:55.360]  I've been following you for about a month.
[03:02:55.360 --> 03:03:00.400]  People has forgotten how much of a power of choice they've got.
[03:03:00.400 --> 03:03:06.000]  People like Piers Morgan who's a talking head for CNN and all the other mainstream media
[03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:14.200]  if people, pure listeners alone, and internet people would just tune them out, stop watching
[03:03:14.200 --> 03:03:19.120]  them, stop following them on the internet, you would see a reaction from them.
[03:03:19.120 --> 03:03:22.320]  I promise you, the Piers Morgan's would disappear.
[03:03:22.320 --> 03:03:24.040]  Well, he is disappearing.
[03:03:24.040 --> 03:03:25.360]  He's only got a half million viewers.
[03:03:25.360 --> 03:03:29.400]  They used to have like 10 million 15 years ago in that same Larry King slot.
[03:03:29.400 --> 03:03:30.400]  He is disappearing.
[03:03:30.400 --> 03:03:31.400]  God bless you.
[03:03:31.400 --> 03:03:32.400]  I appreciate your call.
[03:03:32.400 --> 03:03:33.660]  Thanks for holding to say that.
[03:03:33.660 --> 03:03:38.600]  It's just that the media is magnifying what he's saying, so we're going in there to hijack
[03:03:38.600 --> 03:03:40.400]  their propaganda channel.
[03:03:40.400 --> 03:03:42.280]  Marvin in Texas, he wants to talk about 1776.
[03:03:42.280 --> 03:03:43.840]  We've got one minute, brother.
[03:03:43.840 --> 03:03:46.040]  Hey, Alex, just a feel good story.
[03:03:46.040 --> 03:03:52.680]  I was down there last night and Ja'Carri Jackson is my four-year-old son's hero now.
[03:03:52.680 --> 03:03:59.240]  Followed him around all last night, and by the way, all he's doing now is screaming 7076
[03:03:59.240 --> 03:04:00.240]  all over the house.
[03:04:00.240 --> 03:04:01.560]  I don't know what you did to him.
[03:04:01.560 --> 03:04:05.400]  You corrupted him or not, but it was pretty embarrassing.
[03:04:05.400 --> 03:04:11.680]  I just wanted to make you feel good, man, and by the way, you're not as good as Ja'Carri.
[03:04:11.680 --> 03:04:13.640]  That's what my son's been saying all day.
[03:04:13.640 --> 03:04:17.440]  Ja'Carri, Ja'Carri, look at him on TV and knowing that person.
[03:04:17.440 --> 03:04:20.600]  He is very charismatic, and we're getting him broken in, too.
[03:04:20.600 --> 03:04:21.640]  He's getting used to it.
[03:04:21.640 --> 03:04:26.640]  Right out of college and RTF and stuff, right into the front lines of the Infowars.
[03:04:26.640 --> 03:04:28.800]  He won the reporter contest.
[03:04:28.800 --> 03:04:35.200]  By the way, Infowars.com forward slash contest, $115,000 prizes for films.
[03:04:35.200 --> 03:04:36.560]  You got two and a half months to make it.
[03:04:36.560 --> 03:04:37.560]  It could be three minutes.
[03:04:37.560 --> 03:04:38.560]  It could be an hour.
[03:04:38.560 --> 03:04:39.560]  It could be two hours long.
[03:04:39.560 --> 03:04:44.460]  Infowars.com forward slash contest, but the real prize is out of the group of winners
[03:04:44.460 --> 03:04:49.240]  or the runners-up, we're going to work with people and try to hire folks as filmmakers
[03:04:49.240 --> 03:04:50.240]  to work with us.
[03:04:50.240 --> 03:04:51.240]  This isn't a game.
[03:04:51.240 --> 03:04:52.840]  I mean, it's not just the prize.
[03:04:52.840 --> 03:04:59.880]  You get a shot at working here in the Infowar or click on the red horse at the top of Infowars.com.
