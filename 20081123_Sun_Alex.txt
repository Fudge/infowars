[00:34.000 --> 00:44.000]  From USA Radio News, I'm Jody Jordan. Advisors to President-elect Barack Obama are pleased that Wall Street reacted so well to his choice for Treasury Secretary.
[00:44.000 --> 00:51.000]  The Dow soared almost 500 points Friday on word that Obama had tapped Timothy Geider of the New York Federal Reserve.
[00:51.000 --> 00:59.000]  Obama has even gone outside his inner circle in naming Ellen Moran as White House Communications Director. Here's Sandy Cozel.
[00:59.000 --> 01:07.000]  Moran will be in charge of getting Obama's message out. She's now in charge of Emily's List, a group that backs female candidates who support abortion rights.
[01:07.000 --> 01:16.000]  Moran was an active supporter of Senator Hillary Clinton during the primaries. She also worked for the AFL-CIO and helped plan inaugurals for President Bill Clinton.
[01:16.000 --> 01:29.000]  In Obama, advisor David Alexrod says unless the big three automakers offer a plan for retooling and restructuring, they're unlikely to get any taxpayer help. This is IRN, USA Radio News.
[01:47.000 --> 01:58.000]  The Jupiter study showed us that Crestor had a beneficial effect on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in a never-before-studied population.
[01:58.000 --> 02:05.000]  In Jupiter, Crestor of 20 milligrams was well tolerated in nearly 9,000 patients during the course of the study. I'm Lee Shepard.
[02:05.000 --> 02:13.000]  The blockbuster Call of Duty series is back with Call of Duty World at War, the latest epic action game experience that will leave players breathless.
[02:13.000 --> 02:16.000]  Dairy actor Gary Oldman lends his voice to the game.
[02:16.000 --> 02:23.000]  I was always very intrigued by the game from the very beginning. You play a video game, but you also get a little taste of history.
[02:23.000 --> 02:45.000]  The game is rated M for Mature. For more information, visit Activision.com. I'm Kid Michaels.
[02:45.000 --> 02:53.000]  He mainly wants to send a message to the world that the United States and other nations, big and small, are being aggressive and working together.
[02:53.000 --> 03:06.000]  It was reportedly a coup attempt overnight in Guinea-Bissau in West Africa. The top official says the country's president was not heard. His mutinous soldiers fought their way into his residence during a three-hour gun battle.
[03:06.000 --> 03:16.000]  And a member of Florida State's football team has been named a Rhodes Scholar. Safety Myron Royal interviewed for the honor in Birmingham, Alabama yesterday.
[03:16.000 --> 03:24.000]  The aspiring neurosurgeon then immediately flew north for a game against the University of Maryland, making it to the game before halftime.

[03:58.000 --> 04:18.000]  Sounds from the wake-up call to endeavor astronauts. An excerpt of Can Take My Eyes Off You played for Commander Christopher Ferguson, who's celebrating his 23rd winning anniversary.
[04:18.000 --> 04:27.000]  Astronauts on the International Space Station hope the way a centrifuge is mounted can explain why a water recycling system hasn't been working.
[04:27.000 --> 04:35.000]  For three days in a row, the new machine hasn't quite worked right. It's essential for expanding the size of the crew next year.
[04:35.000 --> 04:43.000]  The U.S. military carried out an offensive in Afghanistan today that left several militants dead. Here's Jason Stragioso.
[04:43.000 --> 04:54.000]  U.S. military said American and Afghan troops were dropped off by helicopters in the southern province of Kandahar into an insurgent safe haven where they killed 17 militants.
[04:54.000 --> 05:04.000]  Southern Afghanistan is the center of the Taliban-led insurgency. More than 5,200 people, mostly militants, have died in insurgency-related violence this year.
[05:04.000 --> 05:14.000]  The Vatican media are praising the music of the Beatles compared to what had caused the standardized, stereotypical songs of today.
[05:14.000 --> 05:25.000]  Last week, the Vatican newspaper and radio noted the 40th anniversary of the Beatles' white album. I'm Jody Jordan for IRN USA Radio News.
[05:44.000 --> 05:54.000]  Lines of credit and cards are often cut back or canceled. Last year, the E-Foods Direct Holiday Food Unit was a fun and exciting one-year supply with a great price.
[05:54.000 --> 06:02.000]  This year, to quickly complete our food supply preparations, E-Foods Direct has created a very serious holiday unit.
[06:02.000 --> 06:12.000]  This super supply costs $300 less than the basic Liberty one-year supply and has more food, safe food for less than half the cost of last year's groceries.

[06:52.000 --> 07:08.000]  Call Alex now toll-free at 877-590-5525. Now live from Austin, Texas. Here's Alex Jones.
[07:08.000 --> 07:25.000]  Congressman Ron Paul joins us out of the gates for his analysis, his breakdown. The congressman from Texas, of course, the presidential candidate who sent shockwaves through the political system, the controlled left-right paradigm, is with us for the next 20 minutes to break down what we're facing.
[07:25.000 --> 07:32.000]  Congressman, are you feeling the dread that many of us are feeling right now?
[07:32.000 --> 07:44.000]  Yes, I do, but I don't think it's brand new. I didn't wake up with it. I've had it for a while. I don't think the election was a surprise, but the rhetoric is getting pretty strong and they are getting very bold.
[07:44.000 --> 08:06.000]  I think McCain was obviously back up candidate in case something happened where Obama didn't win. They'd have been satisfied with McCain, but they've been positioning Obama for a long, long time. He's a man of the people, and yet he was the first guy to spend more money than anybody else.
[08:06.000 --> 08:24.000]  He probably spent more money than everybody else put together in these last two years. On the books, it's about $750 million, but when you look at all the free stuff and you look at all the things that have gone on in the last three or four years, I consider the fact that he's probably had a $2 billion campaign.
[08:24.000 --> 08:43.000]  We have to realize this started a long time before he even announced to be president. Anybody who would have gotten that much favorable coverage for so long, you know that the plans are laid for him to be the individual that's going to be taking care of the corporate elite.
[08:43.000 --> 08:58.000]  Well, he's the guy who helped ram through the bank or takeover bill, and now what you predicted, another predicted is happening. They're openly announcing the end of the dollar, a new Bretton Woods, a new world monetary system run by a small group of private international banks.
[08:58.000 --> 09:06.000]  We will buy our carbon credits from them, and Barack Obama is signaled that he will do whatever they say.
[09:06.000 --> 09:24.000]  Yep, and I think there's no doubt about that. He wouldn't be there if he didn't veto the line. When the meeting starts on November 15th for the new monetary system, this could be the beginning of the end of what we see as what's left of our national sovereignty.
[09:24.000 --> 09:36.000]  I don't know how long it will take for their announcement. I guess the meeting starts on November 15th, and it won't be November 16th. I think it'll be a little while before the announcement is made and before we fully understand it.
[09:36.000 --> 09:48.000]  But I think the fact that the markets are relatively calm right now and the dollar has not totally crashed is all being orchestrated by all the central banks. The message is out that the dollar is doomed.
[09:48.000 --> 09:59.000]  They can't keep doing it. I think temporarily they've been able to hold it together, but something has to give, and it's on the business news station now. It's not just your radio show and others talking about it.
[09:59.000 --> 10:14.000]  I was watching a business station yesterday, and they were very, very upstake lists was on. I guess you've heard of that guy. He was very much bragging about this thing, you know, about a new world reserve currency and world regulations.
[10:14.000 --> 10:20.000]  That means world government, and it looks like it's coming rather rapidly right now.
[10:20.000 --> 10:30.000]  That's right. We played the clip yesterday. He said over the banks, over the stocks, over every nation, a trilateral world currency, everything the trilateral commission announced in the 70s.
[10:30.000 --> 10:41.000]  Everything we warn people about in Obama is saying he's going to give us change, but the change with class warfare is robbing the middle class and transferring it all to the multinational corporations.
[10:41.000 --> 10:59.000]  You know, I guess you heard a statement by Sarkozy from France. He said that we want to reform capitalism, but our president, you know, came right back and he says he's all for this world summit, but only on one condition that we not tamper with the free market system.
[10:59.000 --> 11:06.000]  And people believe this stuff. You know, they just listen to that and it just goes over their heads and it's so sad.
[11:06.000 --> 11:23.000]  And then there's Ron Paul's our guest. For those that just tuned in, the last second we were discussing how they're openly announcing a world government of and by five of good percent of banks, the same international institutions that created the derivatives implosion that we're seeing right now.
[11:23.000 --> 11:27.000]  Reuters, Obama urged to shape new economic order.
[11:27.000 --> 11:38.000]  Biden on the last week is running mate. The new vice president elect has called for world government twice last week and a new world order. Everything we told you decades ago, you are now seeing it.
[11:38.000 --> 11:52.000]  So they move out the old puppet bush. They're moving in the new puppet to fool the left now to get on this bandwagon. And in congressman, I've been interviewing a lot of international experts, by the way, including sticklets is pushing all of this right now.
[11:52.000 --> 12:08.000]  And they are saying yes, the big announcement that Powell's talking about on the 21st or 22nd of January will be devaluing the dollar and basically announcing a new economic order run by the very people that orchestrated all of this.
[12:08.000 --> 12:23.000]  But other world leaders are saying it's also going to be economic implosions and military adventures, Pakistan. What is this huge event where they're naming dates but they won't tell us what it is?
[12:23.000 --> 12:41.000]  Well, they're just getting us prepared and they are doing the planning and they're in charge and unfortunately the people get distracted. I consider our election this whole past year or two is just a distraction making everybody think, boy, this is really critical.
[12:41.000 --> 12:53.000]  This election means everything. If we don't have McCain, the world is going to the go, the dogs are vice versa. If we don't have Obama, we're not going to be able to take care of the people and the poor are all going to suffer and die.
[12:53.000 --> 13:15.000]  And it's all orchestrated so people are misdirected from the important issues of war and peace and money and a federal reserve and a business cycle and all these calamities that are going on. So they don't want us to know and by the time we do know and figure it out, then it's so hard to reverse the trend.
[13:15.000 --> 13:24.000]  It's sort of like the Patriot Act should have been defeated before we passed it. Once it's passed, it's really tough to repeal laws like that.
[13:24.000 --> 13:44.000]  Congressman Powell is saying the 21st and 22nd others are naming that date. You're there at the Hill. You're closer to the inside of the actual workings of power than the general public is. Have you heard anybody who has inside knowledge about what the crisis is or is it going to be the announcement of the New World Order?
[13:44.000 --> 14:01.000]  Well, I think it's going to be announcement of a new monetary order and they'll probably make it sound as very limited. They're not going to say this is world government even though if you control the world money and you control the military, which they do indirectly, they do control the world.
[14:01.000 --> 14:15.000]  They're mainly interested in controlling the money and natural resources and right now it's not in the hands of private property owners. Here in Texas, we develop natural resources pretty much by private property ownership and we all survive rather well.
[14:15.000 --> 14:35.000]  We live after what happens in Alaska, but what happens when it's a world central bank, worldwide regulation and world control of the whole system of all the commodities and all the natural resources. What else can you call that other than world government?
[14:35.000 --> 14:50.000]  And it's going to be controlled by the very financial institutions that orchestrated the controlled crisis and they're openly saying, for those that don't know, and I'd like to comment on this, but these IMF World Bank Chiefs, the head of the International Bank of Settlements, Treasury Secretaries, others,
[14:50.000 --> 15:06.000]  Fed Chairman, are saying that we will pay different stock taxes, different derivatives taxes, different taxes on stock market transactions and there's going to be world carbon taxes that you buy from this group of banks.
[15:06.000 --> 15:15.000]  I mean, that is total control and as Barack Obama said, he's going to bankrupt the coal industry that gives us 49% of our power. This is the neo feudal model.
[15:15.000 --> 15:26.000]  Yep, it is indirect control. They're not going to own the coal mines and the coal processes. What they can do is just tax you and they can control us.
[15:26.000 --> 15:35.000]  And I've argued the case that we don't have private property in this country anymore because we have all the responsibility and liability, but can you use your land without getting permission?
[15:35.000 --> 15:47.000]  You have to get 20 permits to use your own land and in order to stay on the land, you have to pay huge taxes so we pay around to stay on our own property, can't use unless you get government control and government permission.
[15:47.000 --> 15:59.000]  But here now the permission isn't going to just come from Austin or just come from Washington. Now we're going to have to go to Ohio or wherever, wherever they control things.
[15:59.000 --> 16:10.000]  And the big thing here is it blows things up so much that I imagine a few of them think that they'll be able to manage this and we'll be able to help take care of everybody.
[16:10.000 --> 16:15.000]  But obviously that isn't the case. They're going to make this world a lot poorer.
[16:15.000 --> 16:30.000]  You're listening to Alex Jones with Congressman Ron Paul in trend forecaster Gerald Salente in this encore presentation of the Alex Jones radio show.
[16:30.000 --> 16:34.000]  I am so frustrated. I can't seem to remember anything anymore.
[16:34.000 --> 16:35.000]  What?
[16:35.000 --> 16:44.000]  Seriously, my memory and attention span is terrible. I read something and forget. I forget people's names. I hear all this great information on the radio and I want to tell people, but I forget.
[16:44.000 --> 16:48.000]  Okay, slow down. Poor attention and memory loss is not your fault.
[16:48.000 --> 16:57.000]  Factors like fluoride in the water, aluminum and deodorants, genetically modified foods the way the education system taught you. It's all meant to dumb you down.
[16:57.000 --> 17:00.000]  You know, I can remember everything now, even entire books.
[17:00.000 --> 17:01.000]  What? How?

[17:22.000 --> 17:24.000]  Wow. What's the website?

[17:30.000 --> 17:33.000]  Break the law and you're caught on film.
[17:33.000 --> 17:38.000]  Practically impossible for police to spot plates that have been treated with a reflective spray.

[20:42.000 --> 20:58.000]  Congressman Powell is saying the 21st and 22nd others are naming that date. You're there at the Hill. Have you heard anybody who has inside knowledge about what the crisis is or is it going to be the announcement of the New World Order?
[20:58.000 --> 21:14.000]  Well, I think it's going to be an announcement of a new monetary order and they'll probably make it sound as very limited. They're not going to say this is world government even though if you control the world money and you control the military, which they do indirectly, they do control the world.
[21:14.000 --> 21:33.000]  They're mainly interested in controlling the money and natural resources. But what happens when it's a world central bank, worldwide regulation and world control of the whole system of all the commodities and all the natural resources?
[21:33.000 --> 21:36.000]  What else can you call that other than world government?
[21:36.000 --> 21:51.000]  And it's going to be controlled by the very financial institutions that orchestrated the controlled crisis. And they're openly saying, for those that don't know, and I like the Congressman to comment on this, but these IMF World Bank chiefs, the head of the International Bank of Settlements, Treasury Secretaries, others,
[21:51.000 --> 22:07.000]  Fed Chairman, are saying that we will pay different stock taxes, different derivatives taxes, different taxes on the stock market transactions, and there's going to be world carbon taxes that you buy from this group of banks.

[22:36.000 --> 22:48.000]  You have to get 20 permits to use your own land. And in order to stay on the land, you have to pay huge taxes. So we pay around to stay on our own property, can't use unless you get government control and government permission.
[22:48.000 --> 23:00.000]  But here now the permission isn't going to just come from Austin or just come from Washington. Now we're going to have to go to La Hague or wherever, wherever they control things.
[23:00.000 --> 23:11.000]  And the big thing here is it slows things up so much that I imagine a few of them think that they'll be able to manage this and will be able to help take care of everybody.
[23:11.000 --> 23:16.000]  But obviously that isn't the case. They're going to make the world a lot poorer.
[23:16.000 --> 23:26.000]  That's why Newsweek's calling him the president of the world. They're calling him that in British and German and French newspapers. I mean, they are calling him the one.
[23:26.000 --> 23:30.000]  I mean, anytime you see that in history, Congressman, isn't that dangerous?
[23:30.000 --> 23:43.000]  I mean, that means not only dangerous, but maybe we have crossed the Rubicon. You know, maybe it's going to be very difficult. So we have to look for sources of optimism. What do we do?
[23:43.000 --> 23:51.000]  Ultimately though, all that happens to us is a result of philosophy and beliefs and convictions. And that's where I think we've made some inroads.
[23:51.000 --> 23:58.000]  You know, in spite of the shortcomings of our campaign, I think we made some inroads in calling attention to a lot of people in this country.
[23:58.000 --> 24:08.000]  The importance of monetary policy, the importance of the central bank, the importance of how government causes so much problem. It's just that we're in the minority.
[24:08.000 --> 24:13.000]  That's right. Your campaign covered all the issues that are now unfolding center stage on the world.
[24:13.000 --> 24:29.000]  But as you said, the global crisis, they were going to engineer for decades, you've said this, that when we came to that point, it would be with the free market and liberty and freedom be able to use the crisis to expand liberty or with the establishment who orchestrated it,
[24:29.000 --> 24:31.000]  use it to bring in more bondage.
[24:31.000 --> 24:43.000]  Now, I want to get into the trifecta, the House, the Senate, so now the legislative and the executive, at least for a year or two with just absolute power.
[24:43.000 --> 24:53.000]  How dangerous is that with Chuck E. Schumer talking about all these new taxes and more gun control and fairness doctrine restricting free speech?
[24:53.000 --> 25:04.000]  I think it's very dangerous. In the first year, it's probably going to be the most dangerous year. I just think of Bush's first year, but he also had the 9-11 thing that he could use to scare everybody to death.
[25:04.000 --> 25:12.000]  And Obama will use the financial crisis. The crisis will get worse and there'll be some more military skirmishes around the world.
[25:12.000 --> 25:24.000]  He'll say, well, we've got to do this, we've got to do this. And just as the Republican Congress wouldn't say boo to our Republican president, you know the Democratic Congress is never going to stand up.
[25:24.000 --> 25:35.000]  There'll be a couple, maybe a dentist percentage and a few others who are principled in anti-war, but the Democratic Congress will not stand up to the president.
[25:35.000 --> 25:43.000]  As a matter of fact, a lot of Republicans might say, hey, how do I stay in here if Obama's so popular? I better go along with it. I don't want to look like I'm in opposition to this.
[25:43.000 --> 25:49.000]  Sort of like how many people went along with the bailout? Oh, I don't want to look like I don't care about the financial crisis. I better vote for this.
[25:49.000 --> 25:56.000]  Oh, I don't want to look like I don't care about the danger of the terrorists coming here. I better vote for the Patriot Act.
[25:56.000 --> 26:01.000]  There's going to be a lot of that and there's going to be a lot of legislation passed, I think, in the first year.
[26:01.000 --> 26:14.000]  Well, that's the issue. Obama's called for a million-man youth brigade as large as the military. The Air Force has now announced more brigades being added to North Com.
[26:14.000 --> 26:24.000]  What is the left, the mainline left, going to do when they realize that Barack Obama is actually going to intensify all of the policies that George Bush had?
[26:24.000 --> 26:32.000]  Well, there's not too many left. I mean, you have the Ralph Naders and others, but they get marginalized just as I was in the Republican Party.
[26:32.000 --> 26:40.000]  So those who are principled, who object to this, aren't going to be heard from and people are going to go along with it.
[26:40.000 --> 26:48.000]  And that, of course, is where our problem is. So I don't know. It doesn't look all that good.
[26:48.000 --> 26:56.000]  No, it doesn't. Congressman, how do we prepare for this? I mean, we already have the government triple under George Bush.
[26:56.000 --> 27:04.000]  Now Obama is talking about expanding and even more. I mean, what do we do in your educated opinion to somehow save the Republic?
[27:04.000 --> 27:11.000]  Well, they're going to claim they're saving it because they take all these people up and put them in all these organizations in the military on top of things.
[27:11.000 --> 27:20.000]  Well, unemployment rates are going down. That's what they'll probably argue. No, we have to continue to do what we're doing. You're in the business of passing on and spreading information.
[27:20.000 --> 27:27.000]  That, to me, is the most crucial, getting more people engaged, more people understanding what the issues are. Nothing else is more important than that.
[27:27.000 --> 27:39.000]  And then when you see an opportunity, then we have to turn this into political action. And hopefully we don't give up on that too soon, but it does get rather frustrating, especially after elections like this.
[27:39.000 --> 27:51.000]  But there's going to be special elections. There's two senators I have to resign now. There'll be special elections there. There'll be, you know, congressmen that'll, you know, there'll be special elections.
[27:51.000 --> 27:58.000]  And special elections, they give you a better opportunity for us to spread our message and identify because turnouts are lower.
[27:58.000 --> 28:03.000]  That's how I went off. It's the very first time. If I hadn't won that thing, I'd have never been in politics.
[28:03.000 --> 28:13.000]  Congressman, do you think that we are in danger of not just them using the staged economic crisis that they created to get total control, but Gulf of Tonkin's?
[28:13.000 --> 28:22.000]  Because they're also talking about terror attacks, inaugural bombings, al-Qaeda, LCI-ADA wants to test the resolve of the United States. Do you think that's in the cards?
[28:22.000 --> 28:41.000]  Oh, it sure is. But back to the philosophy of the Bush doctrine, which was that we have the right to preemptively strike anybody. And then he even expanded that recently by saying, well, we don't have to invade and conquer, but we have the right to go in and bomb anybody without their permission.
[28:41.000 --> 28:57.000]  That's why we went into, we go into Pakistan and Syria, which are acts of war. So they have the tools to do it, and they have the sentiment, and most Americans are oblivious to what's happening.
[28:57.000 --> 29:06.000]  So you're saying you think members of the establishment might stage something so that people will then support more warmongering, but this time by Obama?
[29:06.000 --> 29:17.000]  Yeah, of course, we've been worrying about that for a long time. I thought it would have occurred sooner because Bush was so anxious to go into Iran. It hasn't happened so far, so maybe our talking about it made him back off a little bit.
[29:17.000 --> 29:19.000]  That doesn't mean we should be complacent.
[29:19.000 --> 29:21.000]  Hold on one second.

[33:29.000 --> 33:40.000]  This is the GCN Radio Network. Home to hard hitting talk radio.
[33:40.000 --> 34:01.000]  We have phones in this hour for our guest and he can talk about any issues of the folks on hold. You can talk to him as well. He's Gerald Salente. I'm really honored to have him with us. We wrote a story at prisonplanet.com. Last week titled Salente predicts revolution, food riots, tax rebellions by 2012.
[34:01.000 --> 34:19.000]  He goes on international television, national television, Fox, CNN, you name it. He is one of the, if not the most accurate, because I've been following him for more than a decade, people predicting trends. They call him a trend forecaster. I would call him a futurist, but I'm just seeing where things are going.
[34:19.000 --> 34:32.000]  And he makes a lot of the similar predictions we make, but I tend to just read UN think tank documents, Rand Corporation, where they say what they're going to do. He said there will be a revolution in this country and it's not going to come yet, but it's going to come down the line.
[34:32.000 --> 34:41.000]  And we're going to see a third party and that's the catalyst for it. The takeover of Washington DC and broad daylight by Wall Street in a bloodless coup.
[34:41.000 --> 34:55.000]  And then he goes into talking about basically riots and homelessness and complete breakdown of society. And so joining us for the next hour is Gerald Salente to talk about a host of issues and get where he thinks we're going in the future.
[34:55.000 --> 35:04.000]  And of course you can also link through and go to his website, trendsresearch.com. Gerald Salente, thanks for coming on.
[35:04.000 --> 35:06.000]  Hey Alex, thank you for having me.
[35:06.000 --> 35:14.000]  We've got three minutes before you break, but just lay out in the first three minutes a little bit about yourself and what trend research is.
[35:14.000 --> 35:31.000]  Well, current events form future trends. So we look at the major social, economic, political, geopolitical, environmental consumer. We look at over 300 different categories on a daily basis worldwide looking for those major trends that are shaping the future.
[35:31.000 --> 35:45.000]  For example, the current event today that everyone should know about is what Citigroup announced. They're firing 50,000 people. And they're not going to make those jobs up in the circuit city of Starbucks.
[35:45.000 --> 35:55.000]  So we look at this data and we analyze it, but we do so as political atheists. Both of these parties, we have nothing to do with them.
[35:55.000 --> 36:04.000]  And so we look at events for what they are and not the way we want them to be. And that's what really stops a lot of people from seeing the future.
[36:04.000 --> 36:14.000]  The other thing is when you look at economic forecasts, political forecasts, they do it one dimensionally. They don't look at all the other interlocking fields.
[36:14.000 --> 36:15.000]  Yes.
[36:15.000 --> 36:29.000]  So that's what we do differently than most others. The system that we have, we call global nomic. It means including the entire world for the word globus and neemine to manage because trends can be managed.
[36:29.000 --> 36:39.000]  You can see what's happening and then take the measures necessary to protect yourself or to profit from what the future may bring.
[36:39.000 --> 36:55.000]  Absolutely. When we come back, I want to get into the fact that the NSA uses its snooping system, not so much to even quote, spy on the individual, but to see major trends and try to get ahead of it to control it and to give that info to select intergroup corporations.
[36:55.000 --> 37:03.000]  The government, the big corporations, they know what you and I know, Gerald, and what you're so good at. They just don't like advertising real systems to the public.
[37:03.000 --> 37:14.000]  Well, yes and no, because we've worked with a number of the major corporations, and that's our business, and I have to tell you, there are corporations like Ford, for example.
[37:14.000 --> 37:27.000]  They came to visit us in the 90s, and we thought we were talking to dead people, and we said, why waste our time working with these people when we know that what we give them is not going to be implemented?
[37:27.000 --> 37:36.000]  So, you know, we assume that they know, but from our experience, Alex, most of them are well behind the curve examples.
[37:36.000 --> 37:41.000]  You know, look at the major corporations today and how they're suffering at so many different levels.
[37:41.000 --> 37:50.000]  Gerald, I want to get into how you integrate all these different sectors of the economy, the society, how you come up with your trends that have turned out to be so accurate.
[37:50.000 --> 38:02.000]  But before we do that, perhaps we should get the listeners who don't know who you are to learn a little bit about Gerald Salinting, how you got in this particular field and became a leader in it, or the leader in it.
[38:02.000 --> 38:19.000]  And basically, some of the predictions that you've made that have been so accurate and where you see us going, you know, fleshing out the discussions that you've had about basically complete breakdown of society and martial law type scenarios.
[38:19.000 --> 38:32.000]  Well, the way I began my career, after graduate school, I managed the mayoral campaign for the fellow running for office in Yonkers, New York in 1971.
[38:32.000 --> 38:45.000]  And from there, they sent me up to Albany. I did such a great job, and I was the assistant to the Secretary of the New York State Senate, which, by the way, was the worst job I ever had.
[38:45.000 --> 38:53.000]  You know, it's a disgusting spectacle to see grown men grovel, particularly from a kid that was grown up in the Bronx.
[38:53.000 --> 39:02.000]  And, you know, when you watch all these people, I'd be talking to a buddy, you know, we'd be in the chambers, in the Senate chambers, and a senator would walk in.
[39:02.000 --> 39:07.000]  My buddy would leave me to go help the senator sit down, you know, pull his chair out, you know.
[39:07.000 --> 39:13.000]  So my friend would come back, I'd say, what's the matter? You know, the guy can't sit down on his own, he needs some help.
[39:13.000 --> 39:17.000]  So that was my, I got to see the insides of government.
[39:17.000 --> 39:28.000]  From there, I went to St. John's University, and I taught probably one of the nation's first courses in American politics and campaign technology in 1972.
[39:28.000 --> 39:39.000]  From there, I went to Chicago, and I was a government affairs specialist working for segments of the chemical industry and other parts of the industry, and between Washington and Chicago.
[39:39.000 --> 39:48.000]  As a matter of fact, I was in D.C. when the first energy crisis hit in 1973.
[39:48.000 --> 39:53.000]  Jimmy Carter later becomes president, and the Iranian conflict breaks out.
[39:53.000 --> 40:02.000]  And I had been following this thing for years, Alex, and I knew how the CIA overthrew the democratically elected government of Iran, and Moshe Deg, and on and on,
[40:02.000 --> 40:10.000]  and how the suboc, the secret police of the Shah, was only second to the SS, you know, it was a brutal regime.
[40:10.000 --> 40:19.000]  When the revolution started to happen in Iran, I knew it was real, because I knew of the pent-up hatred that they had against this guy.
[40:19.000 --> 40:25.000]  Jimmy Carter goes to spend New Year's Eve with the Shah and his wife, and he and Roslyn.
[40:25.000 --> 40:29.000]  And in those days when the president came back from overseas, it was a big deal.
[40:29.000 --> 40:34.000]  He walks up to the microphones after saluting out and walking out of the helicopter on the White House lawn.
[40:34.000 --> 40:41.000]  And Jimmy Carter announced to the American people that the Shah was the island of stability in the Middle East.
[40:41.000 --> 40:47.000]  At that moment, I became a political atheist. I'd been around long enough, I knew the game.
[40:47.000 --> 40:54.000]  And then the second thing that hit me was, what will be the implications of what's going on?
[40:54.000 --> 41:01.000]  And I realized that golden oil prices would increase. So I started to speculate in both those fields.
[41:01.000 --> 41:06.000]  And I was only a kid, I was in my early 30s, you know, and I didn't know what power I was doing.
[41:06.000 --> 41:15.000]  But I did know enough that I knew that the American public was getting one story, and there was a whole other story on the international scene.
[41:15.000 --> 41:23.000]  I made enough money from that where I quit my job, and that's when I began the Trends Research Institute in 1980.
[41:23.000 --> 41:29.000]  I was always under the understanding that current events form future trends.
[41:29.000 --> 41:35.000]  But if I look at them, as you said going into the break, without looking at them the way I want them to be,
[41:35.000 --> 41:42.000]  the way I wish them or hope them to be, and just the way they are, and let the data speak for itself,
[41:42.000 --> 41:47.000]  then you can see a clear direction of where the future is heading.
[41:47.000 --> 41:57.000]  And, you know, it's like going to a doctor. You get a diagnosis. You don't call the doctor an SOB if you don't like his economic or political diagnosis.
[41:57.000 --> 42:02.000]  You accept it for what it is and work from that parameter. And that's what we do.
[42:02.000 --> 42:08.000]  We see the trends, the way they're laying out in front of us, where they're going to go,
[42:08.000 --> 42:16.000]  and then we work around that direction, not trying to redirect it in our minds so that we hope for something different.
[42:16.000 --> 42:22.000]  Well, now specifically, because we have limited time when I can talk to you for 10 hours, you've got so much information briefly.
[42:22.000 --> 42:26.000]  I know you don't like to brag, but no brag, just fact, is John Wayne would say,
[42:26.000 --> 42:33.000]  breakdown of some of the predictions and trends, the projections that you've made that have unfortunately come true.
[42:33.000 --> 42:41.000]  And I say unfortunately because your analysis is pretty much identical to mine and many other experts I'm interviewing
[42:41.000 --> 42:46.000]  about on the good side, total depression, breakdown of society, police state.
[42:46.000 --> 42:57.000]  On the bad side, road warrior, Mad Max, you know, 10,000 BC, just lawless third world bands of...
[42:57.000 --> 43:01.000]  I mean, that's what you're talking about now and that's where all the trends are headed
[43:01.000 --> 43:04.000]  and government is doing everything it can to accentuate that.
[43:04.000 --> 43:09.000]  So let's break down some of your track record and then get into what's happening currently and then into the future, sir.
[43:09.000 --> 43:15.000]  You're listening to Alex Jones with Congressman Ron Paul and trend forecaster Gerald Salente
[43:15.000 --> 43:20.000]  in this encore presentation of the Alex Jones radio show.
[43:23.000 --> 43:25.000]  May I have everyone's attention, please?
[43:25.000 --> 43:30.000]  I've come with a message of information. 9-11 was an inside job.
[43:30.000 --> 43:33.000]  Toxic heavy metals negatively impact our health.
[43:33.000 --> 43:39.000]  There in the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat, the products we use and the objects we touch.
[43:39.000 --> 43:41.000]  Exposure is impossible to avoid.
[43:41.000 --> 43:45.000]  Heavy metals build up within the body over a period of time causing poor health.
[43:45.000 --> 43:50.000]  However, with chelorex, they can be mobilized and excreted in a safe and effective manner.
[43:50.000 --> 43:57.000]  Chelorex was developed based on Dr. Alan Greenberg's clinical experience with heavy metal poisoning during his 25 years of medical practice.
[43:57.000 --> 44:07.000]  Chelorex does not contain EDTA and is made from all natural ingredients, enhancing the body's natural mechanisms for excreting heavy metals and preventing their reabsorption.
[44:07.000 --> 44:12.000]  Chelorex contains antioxidants to protect the liver, kidneys, central nervous system and immune functions
[44:12.000 --> 44:18.000]  and effectively mobilizes mercury and 15 other heavy metals including aluminum, arsenic, lead and more.
[44:18.000 --> 44:27.000]  Find out what chelorex can do for you by calling 1-800-675-4568 or visit us online at chelorex.com.
[44:27.000 --> 44:30.000]  That's chelorex.com today.
[44:31.000 --> 44:35.000]  Santa! Christmas Eve and you haven't left yet?
[44:35.000 --> 44:40.000]  Ho ho ho ho ho! No! I can't find my keys.
[44:40.000 --> 44:46.000]  Here's the perfect gift. Our patented Find One Find All Keyfinder or FOFA XT for short.
[44:46.000 --> 44:51.000]  Once a FOFA keyfinder is attached to each of those easy to lose things, it can find and be found by all the rest.
[44:51.000 --> 44:57.000]  Use your wallet to find your keys, your keys to find the remote control, or any of them to find an uncharged or muted cell phone.
[44:57.000 --> 45:03.000]  FOFA goes through walls, cushions and laundry baskets up to 30 feet and projects a loud 90 plus decibel beep.
[45:03.000 --> 45:07.000]  And new for Christmas, there's even a FOFA just for eyeglasses.
[45:07.000 --> 45:09.000]  Where did I put my glasses, Mrs. Claus?

[47:40.000 --> 47:43.000]  Specifically because we have limited time when I can talk to you for ten hours.
[47:43.000 --> 47:45.000]  You've got so much information briefly.
[47:45.000 --> 47:48.000]  I know you don't like to brag, but no brag, just fact, is John Wayne would say,
[47:48.000 --> 47:53.000]  break down some of the predictions and trends, the projections that you've made
[47:53.000 --> 47:55.000]  that have unfortunately come true.
[47:55.000 --> 48:01.000]  And I say unfortunately because your analysis is pretty much identical to mine
[48:01.000 --> 48:05.000]  and many other experts I'm interviewing about on the good side, total depression,
[48:05.000 --> 48:14.000]  breakdown of society, police state, on the bad side, road warrior, Mad Max, 10,000 BC,
[48:14.000 --> 48:19.000]  just lawless third world bands of...
[48:19.000 --> 48:22.000]  I mean that's what you're talking about now and that's where all the trends are headed
[48:22.000 --> 48:26.000]  and government is doing everything it can to accentuate that.
[48:26.000 --> 48:29.000]  So let's break down some of your track record and then get into what's happening currently
[48:29.000 --> 48:31.000]  and then into the future, sir.
[48:31.000 --> 48:40.000]  Well, I guess my first big forecast came in 1980, actually it was January of 1987
[48:40.000 --> 48:44.000]  and I had predicted that there'd be a stock market crash that year
[48:44.000 --> 48:47.000]  and the Wall Street Journal gave me credit for that one as well.
[48:47.000 --> 48:52.000]  From there, the next big one was with...
[48:52.000 --> 48:58.000]  I had, in my book Trend Tracking as a matter of fact, I came out and said there would be a new third party.
[48:58.000 --> 49:04.000]  This was in 1988 and for some reason I said that Ross Perot would be the type of candidate
[49:04.000 --> 49:09.000]  that would kind of head this kind of party and in those days nobody knew who Ross Perot was.
[49:09.000 --> 49:15.000]  From there, my other big forecast in the consumer end had to do with gourmet coffee,
[49:15.000 --> 49:23.000]  the organic foods, water in the early 80s, a big water trend bottled water,
[49:23.000 --> 49:27.000]  a whole variety of natural healing trends.
[49:27.000 --> 49:33.000]  Matter of fact, one of the early books I worked on in 1986 was called Natural Healing
[49:33.000 --> 49:36.000]  so I got a very good understanding of that field as well
[49:36.000 --> 49:41.000]  and again, this is what really differentiates me from a lot of the other trend forecasts
[49:41.000 --> 49:46.000]  is that I get involved in a lot of the fields where I see things going
[49:46.000 --> 49:49.000]  and understand them at a different level.
[49:49.000 --> 49:51.000]  So those are some of the things.
[49:51.000 --> 49:58.000]  Then back going into the economic crisis, we had then forecast the 1990 recession,
[49:58.000 --> 50:05.000]  how long it would last, and the 1997 foreign currency crisis,
[50:05.000 --> 50:10.000]  the dot com crash in our Trends Journal we set in October 1999
[50:10.000 --> 50:15.000]  and the second quarter of 2000 we would have the dot com bubble would burst,
[50:15.000 --> 50:21.000]  then the ensuing recession, and then this past November 7th,
[50:21.000 --> 50:25.000]  we took out the domain name Panicof08.com
[50:25.000 --> 50:28.000]  and we knew that there would be the Panicof08
[50:28.000 --> 50:32.000]  and we also said that in our Top Trends for 2008,
[50:32.000 --> 50:36.000]  which came out on December 17th, 2007,
[50:36.000 --> 50:40.000]  we said that there would be an economic 9-11.
[50:40.000 --> 50:43.000]  And now we see that unfolding.
[50:43.000 --> 50:48.000]  What is the best case scenario versus the worst case scenario?
[50:48.000 --> 50:50.000]  Take that question any way you want.
[50:50.000 --> 50:53.000]  Those are just general thoughts I have.
[50:53.000 --> 50:57.000]  Let me back up too because we're only human here
[50:57.000 --> 51:01.000]  and we don't see everything and we don't make all the calls properly.
[51:01.000 --> 51:08.000]  In the 1990s, for example, we underestimated around 1993-1994
[51:08.000 --> 51:13.000]  the impact of the computer revolution and the technology boom.
[51:13.000 --> 51:18.000]  And any of us that remember back then, you know, it was still in its infancy.
[51:18.000 --> 51:21.000]  And they had that law, I forget the name of the law,
[51:21.000 --> 51:27.000]  where things increased at an exponential rate in technology
[51:27.000 --> 51:30.000]  far beyond what we had ever anticipated.
[51:30.000 --> 51:34.000]  That's what got us out of the 1990s recession
[51:34.000 --> 51:39.000]  because we should have been in the shape we are in now back then.
[51:39.000 --> 51:43.000]  Had it not been for that technological boom.
[51:43.000 --> 51:47.000]  But isn't it also, I mean, I just have a time where we're simplifying,
[51:47.000 --> 51:52.000]  but also they changed the banking rules in 93-95-99.
[51:52.000 --> 51:54.000]  That also helped the bubble along.
[51:54.000 --> 51:57.000]  That helped the bubble along and that created the big bubble that burst
[51:57.000 --> 51:59.000]  that we're in now, as you well know.
[51:59.000 --> 52:03.000]  So, just to give you the scenarios,
[52:03.000 --> 52:08.000]  yeah, we're saying we're going to go into a depression worse than the Great Depression.
[52:08.000 --> 52:09.000]  And here's why.
[52:09.000 --> 52:12.000]  And then I'm going to tell you why it cannot happen or it may not happen.
[52:12.000 --> 52:14.000]  Yeah, I mean, there is a way to get out of this.
[52:14.000 --> 52:18.000]  There is a way to get out of it, but not through physical and monetary stimulus.
[52:18.000 --> 52:22.000]  If we have an alternative break energy breakthrough
[52:22.000 --> 52:26.000]  beyond solar wind, geothermal, biofuel that they like to talk about,
[52:26.000 --> 52:31.000]  whether it's something in coal fusion, zero point energy, charge clusters,
[52:31.000 --> 52:34.000]  permanent magnets, hydrino power, something like that.
[52:34.000 --> 52:36.000]  That's a productive enhancement.
[52:36.000 --> 52:40.000]  That's as big as the discovery of fire or the invention of the wheel.
[52:40.000 --> 52:43.000]  Then we get out of this economic mess.
[52:43.000 --> 52:46.000]  A whole new market, a paradigm shifting development.
[52:46.000 --> 52:48.000]  You're saying minus that, we're in deep trouble.
[52:48.000 --> 52:53.000]  Minus that, we're going to go into the greatest depression.
[52:53.000 --> 52:54.000]  And here's why.
[52:54.000 --> 52:58.000]  Back when we had the last depression, most people didn't own homes.
[52:58.000 --> 53:00.000]  They didn't have all this burden that they're carrying now
[53:00.000 --> 53:02.000]  with taxes and everything else, insurance.
[53:02.000 --> 53:05.000]  Back then, people didn't have home equity loans.
[53:05.000 --> 53:08.000]  Matter of fact, we're probably both old enough to know
[53:08.000 --> 53:12.000]  when people had something called second mortgages, they were called losers.
[53:12.000 --> 53:14.000]  Back then, people didn't have credit cards.
[53:14.000 --> 53:17.000]  They weren't over $14 trillion in debt.
[53:17.000 --> 53:21.000]  Back then, the government had a trade surplus.
[53:21.000 --> 53:24.000]  We were not $700 billion in the whole week.
[53:24.000 --> 53:26.000]  And the people were self-sufficient.
[53:26.000 --> 53:28.000]  And the people were self-sufficient.
[53:28.000 --> 53:35.000]  Back then, the government was not spending $11.5 trillion
[53:35.000 --> 53:39.000]  in growing in the whole with a budget deficit.
[53:39.000 --> 53:42.000]  Back then, we had budget surpluses.
[53:42.000 --> 53:47.000]  Back then, we weren't costing us over $2 trillion to fight wars.
[53:47.000 --> 53:51.000]  Back then, we had a manufacturing base
[53:51.000 --> 53:56.000]  that when the depression finally did end with the onset of World War II,
[53:56.000 --> 53:59.000]  we were able to manufacture ourselves out of it
[53:59.000 --> 54:02.000]  and then later on the rest of the world.
[54:02.000 --> 54:08.000]  Gerald, you were going over why we're in such a much more precarious
[54:08.000 --> 54:11.000]  and weak and debilitated position
[54:11.000 --> 54:15.000]  than the people that went through the 10 years of the Great Depression
[54:15.000 --> 54:18.000]  and then forecasting where we're going in the future.
[54:18.000 --> 54:19.000]  Please continue.
[54:19.000 --> 54:22.000]  Yeah, the other thing too, and by the way,
[54:22.000 --> 54:25.000]  the one that you pointed out as well is very, very important.
[54:25.000 --> 54:29.000]  The people were more self-sufficient than they are now.
[54:29.000 --> 54:34.000]  This is like a baby state in so many ways.
[54:34.000 --> 54:38.000]  And people looking for help from the government.
[54:38.000 --> 54:41.000]  My God, Katrina Quality Rescue Skills.
[54:41.000 --> 54:43.000]  What are they looking at?
[54:43.000 --> 54:49.000]  And the other thing that people need to know was during the Depression,
[54:49.000 --> 54:55.000]  you can do some of these work project things that they talk about.
[54:55.000 --> 54:58.000]  We didn't have these deficits that we have now.
[54:58.000 --> 55:01.000]  So to keep talking about stimulus packages,
[55:01.000 --> 55:04.000]  to keep talking about work project packages,
[55:04.000 --> 55:07.000]  where is this money going to come from?
[55:07.000 --> 55:11.000]  And again, as every historian or economist knows,
[55:11.000 --> 55:16.000]  the only thing that got us out of that depression was World War II.
[55:16.000 --> 55:20.000]  So having said that, we are looking now in the short term,
[55:20.000 --> 55:23.000]  here's the scenario that we see unfolding.
[55:23.000 --> 55:27.000]  What we're going to see is after,
[55:27.000 --> 55:31.000]  we think the real breakdown is going to begin in February.
[55:31.000 --> 55:33.000]  That's our forecast.
[55:33.000 --> 55:37.000]  Because in February, we're going to now realize the shock
[55:37.000 --> 55:43.000]  of what has happened from a disappointing Christmas holiday retail season.
[55:43.000 --> 55:49.000]  And you think the Obama hope will fade by then as well?
[55:49.000 --> 55:51.000]  Yes, for a lot of people.
[55:51.000 --> 55:54.000]  It's going to fade for the people that have lost everything.
[55:54.000 --> 55:57.000]  You go to all of these places around the country,
[55:57.000 --> 56:02.000]  like the Carolinas, we had Wachovia and all these banking centers,
[56:02.000 --> 56:06.000]  financial centers, people living in their McMansions,
[56:06.000 --> 56:10.000]  and having these huge, huge mortgages.
[56:10.000 --> 56:14.000]  They're going to become Mcboarding houses as they try to get people in there
[56:14.000 --> 56:18.000]  so they can pay the rent and pay the taxes and pay the utilities.
[56:18.000 --> 56:21.000]  So we think it's going to be February
[56:21.000 --> 56:25.000]  because the real dad is going to come in to show how really bad this is.
[56:25.000 --> 56:29.000]  Having said that, there's still going to be the element of hope
[56:29.000 --> 56:33.000]  that Obama is going to be able to do something
[56:33.000 --> 56:37.000]  and being that they're painting him as an FDR
[56:37.000 --> 56:42.000]  and cloaking him in that mantle, get ready for a bank holiday.
[56:42.000 --> 56:47.000]  And I love the terminology, Alex, that they use holiday.
[56:47.000 --> 56:51.000]  Holiday, you know, they think it sounds so beautiful.
[56:51.000 --> 56:54.000]  That means you're not going to get your money out of a bank.
[56:54.000 --> 56:57.000]  And they're going to say, don't worry, it's FDIC insured.
[56:57.000 --> 57:00.000]  We just can't get it out all at once.
[57:00.000 --> 57:03.000]  So we are also in that camp, by the way,
[57:03.000 --> 57:07.000]  that we are going to see, even though it doesn't look like it now,
[57:07.000 --> 57:11.000]  because of a variety of manipulations going on,
[57:11.000 --> 57:16.000]  we believe that gold is going to go into the 2000 range
[57:16.000 --> 57:19.000]  and we're going to see periods of deflation
[57:19.000 --> 57:25.000]  whereby all those homes out there are going to be worth a lot less than they are now.
[57:25.000 --> 57:30.000]  There's a glut of product everywhere, deflationary prices on one end
[57:30.000 --> 57:33.000]  and hyperinflation on the other.
[57:33.000 --> 57:35.000]  As I mentioned with February,
[57:35.000 --> 57:39.000]  because once all these retail outlets start closing,
[57:39.000 --> 57:44.000]  as we're already seeing with Circuit City, with Starbucks,
[57:44.000 --> 57:48.000]  it's going to be a glut of commercial real estate
[57:48.000 --> 57:50.000]  and that's the next shoe to fall.
[57:50.000 --> 57:52.000]  All right, long segment coming up.
[57:52.000 --> 57:57.000]  Breakdown then over the next few years, what he thinks government's response will be to this,
[57:57.000 --> 58:01.000]  why he thinks it will push the people into open rebellion.
[58:01.000 --> 58:03.000]  Our guest is Gerald Salenta.

[59:16.000 --> 59:19.000]  886-2237
[59:46.000 --> 59:49.000]  Traditionally, traditional detoxifying isn't able to clear the body
[59:49.000 --> 59:52.000]  of these harmful and potentially deadly toxins.
[59:52.000 --> 59:54.000]  That's why there's Puricleer from Ripple Creek.
[59:54.000 --> 59:57.000]  Puricleer contains a proprietary blend of ingredients,
[59:57.000 --> 1:00:00.000]  including a cilantro extract and alphalipoic acid,
[1:00:00.000 --> 1:00:04.000]  among other ingredients formulated specifically to promote body cleansing.
[1:00:04.000 --> 1:00:08.000]  Puricleer also has ingredients selected to promote improved circulation
[1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:11.000]  to enhance activity so that heavy metals may be more effectively captured
[1:00:11.000 --> 1:00:13.000]  and removed from the body.
[1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:18.000]  For Puricleer now, by calling Ripple Creek at 203-331-0363
[1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:20.000]  or go to RippleCreek.com.
[1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:23.000]  One School Open and a UT History Professor.
[1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:27.000]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:31.000]  Details on News Radio 590KLB.
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  Hi, RNUSA Radio News. I'm Judy Jordan.
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  President-elect Barack Obama has pledged in a phone conversation
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  with Afghan President Harmut Karzai that fighting terrorism in Afghanistan
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  and the region would be one of his top priorities.
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  Here's Jason Srejo-Sow.
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  Obama's pledge to fight terrorism in the region
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  and apparent pledge in Pakistan should please Karzai,
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:01:00.000]  who has long accused Pakistan's intelligence service
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:03.000]  of supporting the Taliban and bomb attacks inside Afghanistan.
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:06.000]  And President Bush will be meeting with Peru's president
[1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  ahead of today's final meetings of the annual
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:12.000]  Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum.
[1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  And Bush is also hoping for a disarmament agreement
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:17.000]  with North Korea before he leaves office.
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  Here's Penn Feller.
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  The hang-up is what are the terms going to be?
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  How will the world be able to verify that nuclear threat
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:26.000]  of North Korea is gone and trying to get something on paper
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:28.000]  that all the parties can agree on?
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  This is IRN, USA Radio News.
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  It works, it works, it works, it works.
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:37.000]  And what's best is it works from home.
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:39.000]  What have in the world are you anyway?
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  This is Andy Willoughby from the ThreeStepPlan.com Home Business System.
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  The dramatic difference with ThreeStepPlan.com is that it does work.
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  And after almost five years, I think that even the most die-hard skeptic
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:54.000]  would have to agree there must be something different
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:57.000]  about the ThreeStepPlan.com Home Business System.
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:02:00.000]  You see, we operate more like a mini-franchise,
[1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  so you get the expertise of people who have actually been successful
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  working at home to help and guide you in operating your home business.
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  It's kind of like a McDonald's franchise
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:12.000]  without the teenagers and big startup expense.
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  And of course, we don't sell hamburgers.
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  You do get to work with some really nice people
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:18.000]  who share similar family values.
[1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  To find out how you can make more money working from home,
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  go to ThreeStepPlan.com or call 800-480-2102.
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  Police are still looking for the man who opened fire
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  inside a mall packed with shoppers near Seattle yesterday.
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  One person was killed and another is listed in critical condition.
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:47.000]  Police say they expect to identify a suspect soon and make an arrest.
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  Mike Murphy is a police spokesman.
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:52.000]  I'm confident we're going to get him at some point in the near future.
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:56.000]  And retailers are anxiously getting ready for this week's Black Friday.
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:03:00.000]  Stores will be pushing big-time discounts and specials.
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:02.000]  They worry shoppers will be too worried
[1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:05.000]  about their own economic futures to buy much.
[1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:08.000]  Shopper Carlos Colin of Bronx says retirement
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:12.000]  is allowing him to spend money and buy gifts without too much concern.
[1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:16.000]  I'm retired, so I don't have any problems economically.
[1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:20.000]  I have a good federal pension and I get Social Security too now.
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:23.000]  So you're immune from some of this stuff?
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  Practically.
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:30.000]  For more news and analysis, log on to IRNNews.com.
[1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  My name is Jeannie. I'm able to work from home and be a full-time mom.
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:36.000]  Hi. How in the world are you anyway?
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:40.000]  This is Andy Willoughby with the Three Step Plan Home-Based Business System.
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:44.000]  Thousands of Americans are successfully working from home with the Three Step Plan.
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:47.000]  My name is Bill and I've been able to quit my job, pay off all of my bills.
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  To find out how you could work from home with your own home-based business,
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:56.000]  go to threestepplan.com or call 800-897-0395.
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:04:01.000]  800-897-0395.
[1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  This year's group of Rhodes Scholars includes a man
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:08.000]  who used to dish out punishing hits on the football field.
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:10.000]  Here's Bob Eller.
[1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  When he created the scholarships that bear his name,
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:16.000]  Diamond Magnet Cecil Rhodes ordered that recipients not be merely bookworms.
[1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  Myron Roll certainly fits that bill. The Florida State Safety had started
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:24.000]  32 straight games until last night, missing most of the first half
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:27.000]  against Maryland after his scholarship interview.
[1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  Roll plans to be a neurosurgeon.
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  Byron White was a football star and Rhodes Scholar
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  and went on to be a Supreme Court Justice.
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  Tom McMillan and Bill Bradley were Rhodes Scholars.
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  They played pro basketball before serving in Congress.
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:42.000]  Bob Eller, Washington.
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  It isn't quite Big Brother, but it's close.
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  The security precautions for President-elect Barack Obama
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:52.000]  will be like no other. Here's Bryant Thomas.
[1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:55.000]  Those attending the parade and ceremony can expect to be searched
[1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:58.000]  by the machines or security personnel or both.
[1:04:58.000 --> 1:05:01.000]  Precautions will range from magnetometers like those used in airports
[1:05:01.000 --> 1:05:05.000]  to counter snipers, undercover officers, and even bomb-sniffing dogs.
[1:05:05.000 --> 1:05:09.000]  And the U.S. Geological Survey says a moderate earthquake
[1:05:09.000 --> 1:05:12.000]  has struck before dawn off the coast of Puerto Rico.
[1:05:12.000 --> 1:05:15.000]  Randy Baldwin is a geophysicist.
[1:05:15.000 --> 1:05:21.000]  We have a preliminary magnitude of 5.1 at a depth of 6.2 miles.
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:26.000]  It was located approximately 61 miles north from San Juan.
[1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:30.000]  Hi, Jody Jordan for IRN USA Radio News.
[1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:34.000]  I am so frustrated. I can't seem to remember anything anymore.
[1:05:34.000 --> 1:05:35.000]  What?
[1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:37.000]  Seriously, my memory and attention span is terrible.
[1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:40.000]  I read something and forget. I forget people's names.
[1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:42.000]  I hear all this great information on the radio
[1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:44.000]  and I want to tell people, but I forget.
[1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:48.000]  Okay, slow down. Poor attention and memory loss is not your fault.
[1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:51.000]  Factors like fluoride in the water, aluminum and deodorants,
[1:05:51.000 --> 1:05:55.000]  genetically modified foods, the way the education system taught you.
[1:05:55.000 --> 1:05:57.000]  It's all meant to dumb you down.
[1:05:57.000 --> 1:06:00.000]  You know, I can remember everything now, even entire books.
[1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:01.000]  What? How?
[1:06:01.000 --> 1:06:04.000]  There is this website called School of Phenomenal Memory.
[1:06:04.000 --> 1:06:06.000]  Their online course is a real breakthrough
[1:06:06.000 --> 1:06:08.000]  in the field of memory improvement.
[1:06:08.000 --> 1:06:10.000]  In fact, they guarantee that every single person
[1:06:10.000 --> 1:06:13.000]  will be able to memorize any type of information,
[1:06:13.000 --> 1:06:17.000]  including entire books after they complete just 60 lessons.
[1:06:17.000 --> 1:06:23.000]  And they offer a no-questions-asked, no-time limit, money-back guarantee.
[1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:24.000]  Wow, what's the website?
[1:06:24.000 --> 1:06:28.000]  Now, don't forget, it's pmemory.net.
[1:06:28.000 --> 1:06:30.000]  The letter P, memory.net.
[1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:39.000]  Prepare yourself for a talk radio experience.
[1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:42.000]  He stands for truth.
[1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:45.000]  He stands for justice.
[1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:48.000]  He stands for what's right.
[1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:51.000]  This is the Alex Jones show.
[1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:59.000]  Call Alex now, toll free at 877-590-5525.
[1:06:59.000 --> 1:07:05.000]  Now, live from Austin, Texas, he is Alex Jones.
[1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:30.000]  Hey, I was just talking to Gerald Solentator in the break.
[1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:32.000]  He didn't tell me not to say this,
[1:07:32.000 --> 1:07:34.000]  but he'll probably get a seat in the FEMA camp for it,
[1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:38.000]  and he said it was interesting.
[1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  Well, let's just get from Gerald Solentator,
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:42.000]  because I'm interested.
[1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:45.000]  I really respect what he thinks of the work we're doing here
[1:07:45.000 --> 1:07:49.000]  from the work of mine that he's seen.
[1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:50.000]  Mr. Solentator?
[1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:53.000]  Yes, no, I've been following you for years,
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:56.000]  and I admire you as a man of courage.
[1:07:56.000 --> 1:08:01.000]  And in these times, not many people have it anymore.
[1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:04.000]  They're always towing the party line or afraid of the implications
[1:08:04.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  of what they say, and you've been a man that speaks out,
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  you speak your mind, and you're a man of your word
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:11.000]  and your conviction.
[1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:13.000]  So, you know, what's not to admire?
[1:08:13.000 --> 1:08:15.000]  Well, I admire you, but I mean, look,
[1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:17.000]  with me, it's not even courage.
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:19.000]  I would imagine it's the same with you,
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  because I talk to other people that will speak out
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:22.000]  and trailblaze.
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:24.000]  I mean, why would you lie?
[1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:26.000]  I mean, all you've got is who you are in the truth.
[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  You know, money, power, things like that really don't matter
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:31.000]  to a well-centered person.
[1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:33.000]  The truth veritas is everything.
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:35.000]  So, with me, it's not even courage.
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:37.000]  I, in a way, it's the opposite of courage.
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:40.000]  I have been so freaked out by what I saw coming historically,
[1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:43.000]  because we repeat the same activities over and over again,
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:46.000]  that it's actually been out of fear
[1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:48.000]  that I've been trying to change things
[1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:50.000]  and trying to warn people.
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:52.000]  And, you know, also, quote, brotherly love.
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:54.000]  I mean, I don't like seeing people be conned.
[1:08:54.000 --> 1:08:58.000]  I don't like seeing my fellow, you know, humans being hurt.
[1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:00.000]  I mean, why do you do what you do, Gerald?
[1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:02.000]  Because, obviously, you know, you put yourself at risk
[1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:04.000]  doing some of the things you do.
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:07.000]  Oh, yeah. No, listen, you know, it's funny.
[1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:10.000]  When we talked about, you know, the failings
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  of the Bush administration, we were called Bushbashers.
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:16.000]  Now we're being called Obamabashers, you know.
[1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:18.000]  But, you know, it's the price that you pay.
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:20.000]  And you said it. What's more than your word?
[1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:24.000]  I mean, for me, my belief is that when I take that last breath,
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:26.000]  I want to know that I was true to myself.
[1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:30.000]  There's a great saying, you know, that whether it's to Quran,
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:33.000]  the Bible, Jesus, Muhammad, or Buddha,
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:36.000]  there is no salvation for the hypocrite.
[1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:38.000]  You know, what's the difference of living
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:40.000]  if you're going to be a hypocrite?
[1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  But, you know, as we're...
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:46.000]  But it really is a time for people, you know, as they say,
[1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  you know, now is the time for all good men
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  to come to the aid of their country.
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  And this is that time.
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  And we've never seen it more than this
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  because there is going to be that period following.
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:02.000]  When the crime rates start going up,
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:04.000]  the first reaction is going to be,
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  send more police out into the streets.
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  And so they're going to build up more and more of this.
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:14.000]  Again, you can call what's going on now
[1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  with the government now controlling
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:18.000]  the world's largest insurance company,
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:21.000]  the world's largest mortgage brokerage.
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  And now they're talking about taking over
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:26.000]  one of the largest auto companies
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:30.000]  and, of course, now they're buying into the banks.
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  You could call this either socialism, communism,
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:38.000]  or fascism, but you cannot call it free enterprise or democracy.
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  That's right. It's total command and control.
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  And the break in a refugee,
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:46.000]  you were continuing to go through how you should see this unfolding
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:49.000]  and just how bad it's going to get.
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  So what we're looking at then
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  is they're going to call a bank holiday, we believe.
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:58.000]  And we also believe that they're going to try the same thing
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  that FDR did with confiscating gold.
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:04.000]  That'll be another thing because we're already hearing
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:08.000]  from the G20 members to re-institute some format
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:10.000]  of the Brenton Woods Agreement,
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  which, of course, gold was the standard.
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:16.000]  But, of course, there's too much money out there,
[1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:22.000]  so that means gold would probably be $6,000 or $60,000 an ounce.
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:25.000]  It would have a really, really high value.
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:28.000]  So we think that there's going to be that kind of confiscation.
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  We think also that they're doing it already.
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  They're squeezing the little people,
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:36.000]  and this is why there's going to be a revolt.
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  You look at, go around the country, Alex,
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  state after state, city after city, locality after locality.
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:48.000]  They're raising taxes to make up for lost revenues.
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:50.000]  How are the people going to pay these things
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:55.000]  when their median household income is well below 1999 levels?
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:57.000]  Wages are falling behind.
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  How are they losing their jobs?
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:00.000]  That's number one.
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  Here in New York, what they're doing in the city
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  is they just hired several hundred new traffic enforcement officers
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  so that when you're driving in New York City
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:14.000]  and if your car goes into that white space
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  between the lines where the pedestrian walks, you get a ticket.
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:21.000]  What they're doing is white-gloving everyone now.
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:24.000]  Everywhere I drive in Austin, there's a cop every half mile.
[1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:26.000]  Now if you go a couple miles over the speed limit,
[1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  they give you a ticket.
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:29.000]  Everything's being watched,
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  but then they admit in major Texas papers
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  that illegal aliens are above the law.
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:36.000]  They don't have to have any driver's license, insurance,
[1:12:36.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  nothing, only the citizens.
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  Meanwhile, traffic enforcement cops in New York have gotten in trouble
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:44.000]  because they drive the worst, they park wherever they want,
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:46.000]  they do whatever they want.
[1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  They're just going to keep squeezing and squeezing
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:51.000]  and now, not just property taxes,
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  they're saying, we're just going to assess you,
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:56.000]  20,000 bucks, everybody in the town,
[1:12:56.000 --> 1:12:58.000]  for new roads we're putting in.
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  Government just is going crazy.
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  What's going to happen?
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:03.000]  This is why the revolt is going to take place.
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:05.000]  There's another one, too.
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  They've unleashed all of the people from the sales tax people,
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  going to all the small shops, the pizza shops,
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:16.000]  the liquor stores, all the small people,
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:19.000]  and they're cracking down on them,
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  making them pay more sales tax.
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:24.000]  IRS is going to go after more of the small people
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  because the too big to fails,
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  the too big to control, and too big to monitor.
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  So this is where the revolution starts taking place
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:35.000]  because when you're hungry,
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  and when you're out of the job,
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  and when you're out on the streets,
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:42.000]  you don't want to hear, yes, we can anymore.
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:45.000]  And that's what's going to happen.
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  And the other thing that's going to happen as well
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:52.000]  is we believe that there's going to be a new third party
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:55.000]  formed around the same reasons the third parties
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:13:58.000]  were formed in the 19th century
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  against the central bankers taking over the country.
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  And if anybody's not old enough to see what's happening
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  or too blind to look, they better wake up.
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:10.000]  As we said in our trend alert recently,
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:12.000]  it was the D.C. Heist.
[1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:14.000]  They hijacked Washington.
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:17.000]  And you have Henry Paulson in there from Goldman Sachs.
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:19.000]  I love it, you know, the liberals, you know,
[1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:21.000]  they bash Bush and Cheney.
[1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:24.000]  You know, that Cheney has ties to Halliburton.
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:27.000]  Yeah, how about, you know, who did Obama bring in
[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:30.000]  as his new team, his transition team in there?
[1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  To the economy, Robert Rubin and Larry Summers.
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  They're the guys that changed the rules to do all of this.
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:40.000]  Exactly.
[1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  They're the ones that put the nail in the Glass-Steagall Act.
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  That allowed the banksters to be running wild as they are now.
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  And also to put all these phony little gambling games
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:54.000]  like derivatives.
[1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:57.000]  Well, here's the $64 million question then.
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:15:00.000]  Why did Kashkari even go up before the House
[1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:04.000]  and basically admit they took the $5 trillion, not $700 billion?
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:06.000]  They're not telling anybody where it went.
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:08.000]  And then he started laughing at them.
[1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:12.000]  I mean, I've never even in modern history or even in Rome
[1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:14.000]  with Caligula, you know, marrying his horse,
[1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:19.000]  seen this type of craziness where it's like they're wanting
[1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:22.000]  to push us into rebellion.
[1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:23.000]  Exactly.
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:24.000]  And this is the same thing.
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:28.000]  I mean, the same thing happened in France, you know.
[1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:34.000]  If they don't, they are living in a world that is...
[1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  And I was on the MSNBC one time and recently,
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  during the elections, and Mitt Romney was still in the race
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:44.000]  and he came out with his shining city on the hill kind of thing
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:46.000]  trying to mimic Reagan.
[1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:51.000]  And the host said to me, well, isn't Governor Romney correct?
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:52.000]  What are you saying?
[1:15:52.000 --> 1:15:54.000]  Should we be more hopeful?
[1:15:54.000 --> 1:15:56.000]  This was, you know, last year and I said,
[1:15:56.000 --> 1:15:58.000]  this year actually, but earlier than you.
[1:15:58.000 --> 1:16:01.000]  And I said, this guy doesn't go to the gas station
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:03.000]  and pump his own gas.
[1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:06.000]  He doesn't go shopping and stop and shop
[1:16:06.000 --> 1:16:09.000]  and watch the prices of cut coupons.
[1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:11.000]  They don't have a clue what's going on.
[1:16:11.000 --> 1:16:13.000]  And that's what's going on over here.
[1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:15.000]  Let them eat cake.
[1:16:15.000 --> 1:16:18.000]  You're listening to Alex Jones with Congressman Ron Paul
[1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:23.000]  and trend forecaster Gerald Salente in this encore presentation
[1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:49.000]  of the Alex Jones Radio Show.
