[00:00.000 --> 00:12.600]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.600 --> 00:21.360]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:21.360 --> 00:33.680]  show we're going to have a amazing show today because we're going to look at the
[00:33.680 --> 00:39.320]  fight at the state level for nullification nullification of laws that are attacking
[00:39.320 --> 00:42.120]  our fundamental rights at the federal level I think that's really where the
[00:42.120 --> 00:45.840]  fight is and we're going to look at this in multiple areas where this is
[00:45.840 --> 00:50.100]  developing the militarization of the police there's a law in New Jersey that's
[00:50.100 --> 00:54.880]  just been put in passed in committee unanimously looks like the guy actually
[00:54.880 --> 00:57.960]  passed in the house and the Senate not just in committee it's going to go before
[00:57.960 --> 01:02.400]  the governor looks like it may pass so that's a pushback at the state level
[01:02.400 --> 01:04.800]  against this militarization of the police we're going to tell you how that would
[01:04.800 --> 01:08.960]  break down also the filming of the police we pointed out yesterday that in
[01:08.960 --> 01:13.800]  Montana they have a law that would essentially make you get a license say
[01:13.800 --> 01:20.080]  to to film the police and then give them editorial control over everything that
[01:20.080 --> 01:26.560]  you capture to keep editorial control of it we also have a law introduced in
[01:26.560 --> 01:30.480]  Texas about that but then there's other laws that are pushing back in other
[01:30.480 --> 01:34.880]  states in Colorado they want to uphold the right of citizens to film the police
[01:34.880 --> 01:40.120]  because I understand that that is going to constrain criminal behavior on the
[01:40.120 --> 01:44.560]  part of the police drug prohibition all over the place we see this happening
[01:44.560 --> 01:49.120]  there was just a recent introduction of a bill in North Carolina that we're
[01:49.120 --> 01:54.640]  going to talk about and I was very saddened to see the reaction of Christians
[01:54.640 --> 01:59.360]  in that area as Christians and Republicans why can't they get it I
[01:59.360 --> 02:04.800]  would think the Republicans would be concerned about the cost of prisons I
[02:04.800 --> 02:08.400]  would think that they'd be concerned about the loss of property rights not
[02:08.400 --> 02:12.520]  just the loss of property but the loss of your right to having property the
[02:12.520 --> 02:16.560]  idea that the government can call it civil asset forfeiture that they can
[02:16.560 --> 02:20.600]  charge your property with a crime never charging you with a crime never getting
[02:20.600 --> 02:25.640]  a conviction if they can do that you don't have any property rights and I
[02:25.640 --> 02:29.320]  always thought that Republicans understood property rights and I thought
[02:29.320 --> 02:32.920]  they understood that that was a fundamental freedom money is one of the
[02:32.920 --> 02:36.720]  things that Republicans seem to be under able to understand but not in the
[02:36.720 --> 02:41.200]  area of drug prohibition and what about the Christians where is their
[02:41.200 --> 02:44.200]  compassion we're going to talk about that and we're going to talk about the
[02:44.200 --> 02:50.560]  editorial from a Christian organization that opposed a medical marijuana in
[02:50.560 --> 02:55.080]  North Carolina and how he was just wringing his hands about what a tough
[02:55.080 --> 02:59.440]  day he had at the legislature pushing back against all the people who were
[02:59.440 --> 03:04.400]  coming forward with their testimony about how medical marijuana was essential
[03:04.400 --> 03:07.640]  to their health how they had tried everything else and nothing had worked
[03:07.640 --> 03:13.560]  it just discounts their testimony maybe they're going to discount his Christian
[03:13.560 --> 03:18.080]  testimony when he talks to them because they don't see the actions of Christ in
[03:18.080 --> 03:21.440]  his life we won't talk about that in detail but of course there's also the
[03:21.440 --> 03:26.120]  push at the state level to mandate vaccines and the pushes against that
[03:26.120 --> 03:30.480]  there's bills on both sides of that there's also the mandate of mental health
[03:30.480 --> 03:35.000]  exams interestingly enough the same guy in Texas that wants to mandate mental
[03:35.000 --> 03:39.320]  health exams for your children also wants to prohibit you from filming the
[03:39.320 --> 03:43.720]  police a Republican out of Dallas we're going to talk about that in detail
[03:43.720 --> 03:49.640]  Ebola is back in the news actually we just haven't heard much about it in
[03:49.640 --> 03:54.880]  America but it has been very much a part of the news in Africa although the
[03:54.880 --> 04:00.200]  number of new cases in Liberia and Guinea had dropped they're now going back up
[04:00.200 --> 04:05.480]  in Guinea and Sierra Leone never got it under control Sierra Leone is now in the
[04:05.480 --> 04:09.760]  middle of a another quarantine if you remember back in the fall I think was in
[04:09.760 --> 04:14.040]  September they had a quarantine of a million people now they're trying to do
[04:14.040 --> 04:18.760]  it for two and a half million so it is far from over but I'll tell you what
[04:18.760 --> 04:25.400]  concerns me far more than just Ebola and that is the Ebola vaccines that are
[04:25.400 --> 04:30.400]  being worked on by GlaxoSmithKline and by Merck and those are about ready to
[04:30.400 --> 04:34.840]  deploy and we're going to be talking to Gerald Salente in the second hour we're
[04:34.840 --> 04:39.720]  going to talk about Saudi Arabia's moves in Yemen that's a big story

[07:17.240 --> 07:21.920]  welcome to the alex jones show on this Monday March 30th 2015 I'm David Knight
[07:21.920 --> 07:25.720]  your host today we're gonna be joined in the second hour with Gerald Salenti he's
[07:25.720 --> 07:30.720]  gonna be talking about Saudi Arabia's move into Yemen that's a very important
[07:30.720 --> 07:33.560]  move with a lot of implications and it we're gonna be talking to him about that
[07:33.560 --> 07:37.200]  but of course there are some interesting articles that broke on drudge over the
[07:37.200 --> 07:42.880]  weekend one of them talking about Hillary Clinton's emails on the server this
[07:42.880 --> 07:47.040]  is really amazing this is from the New York Times and they say that her lawyer
[07:47.040 --> 07:52.080]  told a congressional committee on Friday that after turning over some of the
[07:52.080 --> 07:57.320]  emails to the congressional committee they put up a setting on the account
[07:57.320 --> 08:02.280]  that change it to retain only emails sent in the previous 60 days that was her
[08:02.280 --> 08:06.120]  lawyer so he said the setting was altered after she gave the records to the
[08:06.120 --> 08:11.360]  government course nobody can verify that she separated out the private from any
[08:11.360 --> 08:14.560]  incriminating emails we just have to take her word for it and the lawyer's
[08:14.560 --> 08:20.440]  word for it because now they don't exist she scrubbed the computer that's pretty
[08:20.440 --> 08:24.960]  amazing isn't it you know that in and of itself should be a crime it certainly is
[08:24.960 --> 08:30.640]  evidence of trying to I would say even an admission of guilt and of course they
[08:30.640 --> 08:35.000]  Republican Party wasted no time and pointing out that even Nixon didn't
[08:35.000 --> 08:38.800]  destroy the tapes I mean he had that 18 minutes of silence that Rosemary Woods
[08:38.800 --> 08:43.360]  managed to put in there for him but he didn't destroy all the tapes maybe he
[08:43.360 --> 08:48.080]  just hadn't had the technical capability or maybe Hillary Clinton I actually saw
[08:48.080 --> 08:52.560]  the meme on on Twitter they showed Hillary Clinton you know because she was
[08:52.560 --> 09:00.320]  involved in the the Watergate trial and said maybe she just learned her lesson
[09:00.320 --> 09:03.880]  oh I know what to do next time I'll get rid of all the evidence so I guess that
[09:03.880 --> 09:08.320]  was a lesson that she learned from that also on drudge of course was the article
[09:08.320 --> 09:13.360]  that we have an info wars dot com about this military training in Fort Lauderdale
[09:13.360 --> 09:18.000]  video shows troops training to intern citizens in Fort Lauderdale caught on
[09:18.000 --> 09:22.320]  camera we talked about this a great deal yesterday a very very troubling video
[09:22.320 --> 09:28.440]  and as I pointed out this is really the NDAA's indefinite detention being put
[09:28.440 --> 09:34.160]  into practice we were all very concerned in that past in 2011 the indefinite
[09:34.160 --> 09:38.240]  detention of citizens by the military and you can see them training for that
[09:38.240 --> 09:41.440]  now and that's precisely what they're going to be doing with the Jade Helm
[09:41.440 --> 09:46.800]  exercise as well as we played yesterday and as we played on Friday when they
[09:46.800 --> 09:50.600]  presented this to the Brazos County commissioners here in Texas what they
[09:50.600 --> 09:54.200]  were telling them that at least in their area they were going to have a plane
[09:54.200 --> 09:58.120]  that was going to fly in from Louisiana it was going to extract people it would
[09:58.120 --> 10:02.040]  be a very quick operation 15 minutes in and then they're out and that's what we
[10:02.040 --> 10:06.480]  saw happening in Fort Lauderdale we saw the Black Hawk helicopters coming in
[10:06.480 --> 10:11.280]  extracting people we saw people being taken down on the streets roleplayers
[10:11.280 --> 10:15.680]  how are you going to tell in the future whether it's roleplayers or if it's just
[10:15.680 --> 10:19.840]  people who criticize the government see that's what's really dangerous about
[10:19.840 --> 10:24.000]  this it's dangerous on many many levels but of course they're training us to get
[10:24.000 --> 10:28.440]  accustomed to seeing them march people through the streets in single file they
[10:28.440 --> 10:32.240]  were they're getting accustomed to seeing them put people as we're watching on
[10:32.240 --> 10:35.480]  the screen right now if you're looking at this taking people and putting them in
[10:35.480 --> 10:41.160]  white vans and driving them out to the internment camp where who knows what
[10:41.160 --> 10:44.960]  they'll do I think I've got an idea anybody knows about the history of
[10:44.960 --> 10:48.240]  Gitmo anybody knows about the history of the CIA has pretty good idea of what
[10:48.240 --> 10:52.640]  they're doing these are the boots on the ground for the secret black-op state
[10:52.640 --> 10:58.160]  that we have created here the CIA the NSA and of course the special forces who
[10:58.160 --> 11:02.840]  are their boots on the ground doing this kind of work now Ron Rand Paul spoke
[11:02.840 --> 11:07.640]  to some students in Maryland at the Bowie State University in Maryland on
[11:07.640 --> 11:11.720]  March 13th and this is what he had to say about indefinite detention to the
[11:11.720 --> 11:15.360]  students there he said we have something now in America called indefinite
[11:15.360 --> 11:19.360]  detention he said this means that American citizen could be indefinitely
[11:19.360 --> 11:24.320]  placed in prison and sent to Gitmo forever without trial now they point out
[11:24.320 --> 11:29.160]  that this is a mostly minority audience so he talks to them he goes anybody
[11:29.160 --> 11:31.960]  ever think there was any animus towards African-Americans in our country
[11:31.960 --> 11:34.640]  anybody think there's ever been animus towards any kind of minority in our
[11:34.640 --> 11:39.560]  country you ought to be concerned about incarceration without trial everybody
[11:39.560 --> 11:43.560]  should be concerned about this because primarily it's going to be focused on
[11:43.560 --> 11:48.400]  people that are political enemies of the government points out in this article
[11:48.400 --> 11:51.760]  from New American they say one of the most noxious elements of the NDAA is
[11:51.760 --> 11:54.600]  that it places the U.S. military at the disposal of the president for the
[11:54.600 --> 11:59.560]  apprehension arrest and detention of those who are suspected opposing a
[11:59.560 --> 12:03.640]  danger to the homeland the endowment of such a power to the president by the
[12:03.640 --> 12:07.000]  Congress is nothing less than a de facto legislative repeal of Posse
[12:07.000 --> 12:12.840]  Comitatus Act of 1878 which forbids the use of the military and domestic law
[12:12.840 --> 12:18.040]  enforcement yeah it was going all the way back to James Madison who said if we
[12:18.040 --> 12:25.160]  have a standing army combined with an overacting unrestrained executive that's
[12:25.160 --> 12:29.040]  going to destroy freedom in our country you also point out that a standing army
[12:29.040 --> 12:34.660]  has always been used to create tyranny a standing army that is supposedly for
[12:34.660 --> 12:39.760]  fighting tyrants abroad is always used to establish tyranny at home that's the
[12:39.760 --> 12:43.680]  way it's been throughout history we understand that they understood that we
[12:43.680 --> 12:47.560]  didn't want a standing army either of the military or as I pointed out yesterday
[12:47.560 --> 12:51.840]  even of the police we've got the police at a state city police level we've got
[12:51.840 --> 12:56.240]  the sheriff we've got the highway patrol we have multiple levels of men with
[12:56.240 --> 13:01.600]  guns and badges as it is here now Posse Comitatus was about having the power in
[13:01.600 --> 13:05.960]  the community so that you would have a law enforcement officer or you would
[13:05.960 --> 13:13.000]  have army officers but in order for them to actually help with a felony or with
[13:13.000 --> 13:15.920]  a bank robber to catch him they would call out the Posse because the power
[13:15.920 --> 13:20.440]  resided in the community that's what Posse Comitatus means it means power of
[13:20.440 --> 13:25.680]  the community the power needs to be in the community if we turn this over we
[13:25.680 --> 13:30.880]  become slaves because we will be effectively disarming ourselves because
[13:30.880 --> 13:35.000]  this will be so asymmetric and that's what they plan on that's what they're
[13:35.000 --> 13:38.660]  working on that's where they drill inside the military bases is on the
[13:38.660 --> 13:42.960]  asymmetric warfare military bases inside api hill that Joe Biggs and I walk
[13:42.960 --> 13:48.400]  through as well as other asymmetric warfare training facilities and this
[13:48.400 --> 13:55.960]  drill this jade helm is unconventional warfare it is a PSYOP first and foremost
[13:55.960 --> 14:01.120]  but it is also about asymmetric warfare we need to understand the danger of this
[14:01.120 --> 14:05.560]  and as Rand Paul points out he says any American could one day find him or
[14:05.560 --> 14:10.000]  herself branded as a belligerent and subject to the complete confiscation of
[14:10.000 --> 14:14.560]  their constitutional civil liberties and nearly never-ending incarceration in a
[14:14.560 --> 14:19.240]  military prison and this final quote Rand Paul said I'm not questioning whether
[14:19.240 --> 14:23.760]  the president is a good man I'm questioning whether you want a law on
[14:23.760 --> 14:29.000]  the books that requires our leaders to be good people do you understand that
[14:29.000 --> 14:35.000]  that's why we have checks and balances we cannot imagine that these people are
[14:35.000 --> 14:39.400]  going to be angels because men are not good we have to have these kinds of
[14:39.400 --> 14:43.360]  checks and balances you know we we create government to come after the bad
[14:43.360 --> 14:48.280]  guys but we have to have some way to watch the watchers to control the people
[14:48.280 --> 14:52.920]  we need to talk about what we're going to do with the military what we're going
[14:52.920 --> 14:56.560]  to do about the militarization of the police and quite frankly I don't think
[14:56.560 --> 15:00.120]  we're going to be able to stop it at the federal level I think it's gone too far
[15:00.120 --> 15:04.240]  I think we'd let it go for too long the only chance we have now I believe is at
[15:04.240 --> 15:09.080]  the state level with state nullification and there is a fight going on for at the
[15:09.080 --> 15:13.080]  state level in multiple areas one of these is of course a resistance to the
[15:13.080 --> 15:18.480]  militarization of the police and it's coming from of all places New Jersey the
[15:18.480 --> 15:21.880]  last place I would expect it to happen well actually Maryland would probably be
[15:21.880 --> 15:24.760]  the last place I would expect it to happen but it's actually coming out of
[15:24.760 --> 15:28.960]  New Jersey this is an article on WorldNet Daily New Jersey bans acquisition of
[15:28.960 --> 15:35.280]  tools of war without the okay of the local community the sponsors of the
[15:35.280 --> 15:38.800]  bill said that it's an important first step towards blocking federal programs
[15:38.800 --> 15:45.840]  that militarize the police as a state bill s 2364 a Democrat put it up but
[15:45.840 --> 15:52.040]  guess what it was approved 36 to nothing and 70 to nothing and the House and Senate
[15:52.040 --> 15:57.480]  of New Jersey unanimously approve this what did they approve I said the law
[15:57.480 --> 16:01.440]  interposes the local government in the process giving the people of New Jersey
[16:01.440 --> 16:06.120]  the power to end it and at least forcing the process into the open it wouldn't
[16:06.120 --> 16:09.240]  put an end to the militarization of New Jersey law enforcement but it does
[16:09.240 --> 16:14.200]  create a mechanism for local communities to stop the free-flowing tide of
[16:14.200 --> 16:19.960]  equipment citizens now have the power and the forum to pressure their elected
[16:19.960 --> 16:24.120]  officials at a city and county level to vote against acquisitions or to face the
[16:24.120 --> 16:28.240]  consequences come the next election the new law also creates an environment of
[16:28.240 --> 16:33.360]  transparency that did not exist before and we've seen this we've seen pushbacks
[16:33.360 --> 16:38.920]  at the local committee local county level this happened in New Hampshire why
[16:38.920 --> 16:45.240]  do we have to have mine resistant armored personnel carriers in really small
[16:45.240 --> 16:49.480]  towns whether basically isn't any crime even if there were crime that is not the
[16:49.480 --> 16:53.160]  way to approach it I think we need be going in the other direction I think we
[16:53.160 --> 16:57.160]  need to reduce the size of our police forces down to a small core that they
[16:57.160 --> 17:01.320]  can then call on the armed community to protect itself when there really is a
[17:01.320 --> 17:05.600]  legitimate threat to the community because we need to understand that the
[17:05.600 --> 17:09.360]  massive armies of police that we've put in the cities just as we saw in New
[17:09.360 --> 17:14.440]  York when they stood back and said we're not going to harass people we're not
[17:14.440 --> 17:18.200]  going to arrest people find people for your petty laws like they did Eric
[17:18.200 --> 17:23.760]  Garner when they actually killed him for not paying the tobacco tax they said
[17:23.760 --> 17:27.200]  we're not going to do that if you don't have our back they were criticized by
[17:27.200 --> 17:31.760]  City Hall by the mayor de Blasio so they said all right fine we're not going to
[17:31.760 --> 17:36.520]  arrest or find people unless it's absolutely necessary and guess what it
[17:36.520 --> 17:42.720]  dropped the arrests dropped by 95% because more than 95% of what they're
[17:42.720 --> 17:49.000]  doing is not necessary it is not keeping the peace it is generating the
[17:49.000 --> 17:53.840]  revenue that's what the police have been used for so they're being used against
[17:53.840 --> 17:57.720]  the people they're not there to help guide and organize the people when
[17:57.720 --> 18:01.040]  there really is a challenge to the community that's what we need to move
[18:01.040 --> 18:05.760]  back against we need to go back to not having standing armies of uniform
[18:05.760 --> 18:09.240]  people watching over us and we certainly don't need to go the next step and
[18:09.240 --> 18:15.040]  abrogate Posse Comitatus for the military and allow the president to use
[18:15.040 --> 18:20.160]  the military as a law enforcement vehicle that's what's being done with
[18:20.160 --> 18:25.960]  these MRAP programs they actually even stopped it last summer for a while for
[18:25.960 --> 18:29.080]  the fire departments even though that was a 60-year-old program they stopped
[18:29.080 --> 18:31.720]  giving equipment to the fire departments but they're saying this is for
[18:31.720 --> 18:36.120]  emergency you know a fire is an emergency they got that reinstated but it
[18:36.120 --> 18:39.040]  shows where the roots are coming from say what this will be right back talking

[22:59.640 --> 23:02.600]  Jones show I'm David Knight your host and as I point out in the last segment
[23:02.600 --> 23:06.800]  we're gonna have Gerald Salenty joining us at the top of the next hour he's gonna
[23:06.800 --> 23:12.640]  be talking about Saudi Arabia's move in the Yemen a lot of implications of that
[23:12.640 --> 23:18.120]  one of those was it caused spikes in the price of oil but it's got some real
[23:18.120 --> 23:22.160]  huge geopolitical consequences involved in that so we're gonna talk to Gerald
[23:22.160 --> 23:27.680]  Gerald Salenty about that and in the last segment I was talking about how
[23:27.680 --> 23:34.480]  there's a pushback at the state level on many different areas it's not just on
[23:34.480 --> 23:38.280]  vaccines mandatory vaccines you see that's a huge fight going on at the
[23:38.280 --> 23:42.920]  state level but also now we see that in New Jersey they are pushing back on the
[23:42.920 --> 23:47.960]  militarization of the police with this Pentagon program that puts heavy-duty
[23:47.960 --> 23:53.840]  military vehicles in the hands of small local police departments I believe it is
[23:53.840 --> 23:59.480]  a white elephant burden on these local communities as well as an implied threat
[23:59.480 --> 24:02.880]  to them because this is not anything they need to control crime this is how
[24:02.880 --> 24:06.600]  far out of hand we are this is why we need to be concerned about the
[24:06.600 --> 24:11.760]  militarization of the police and we need to be concerned about the military being
[24:11.760 --> 24:17.120]  used as police and both of those come back to Posse Commitatus whole idea of
[24:17.120 --> 24:22.120]  the militia the whole idea of the Posse was that the power would reside in the
[24:22.120 --> 24:25.720]  community not with a government that could use it for oppression that's why
[24:25.720 --> 24:30.760]  they did not want a standing army to continue after a war it would shut down
[24:30.760 --> 24:35.040]  and you would have a core of officers you would continue to have the Navy the
[24:35.040 --> 24:38.920]  Navy couldn't be used for oppression it would not be boots on the ground that
[24:38.920 --> 24:42.880]  are going to eventually wind up as boots on your neck because that's the way it
[24:42.880 --> 24:46.800]  always happens with a standing army they eventually wind up standing on you
[24:46.800 --> 24:49.960]  that's the way it's always been throughout history and now we see this
[24:49.960 --> 24:54.400]  playing out in our in our country because we don't understand human nature
[24:54.400 --> 24:57.960]  because we don't remember history we're going to repeat this again this is what
[24:57.960 --> 25:03.840]  they said in New Jersey this is a log in it passed 36 to nothing and 70 to nothing
[25:03.840 --> 25:06.840]  in the legislative chambers is going to go before Chris Christie they expect
[25:06.840 --> 25:11.320]  that he's not going to stand against the unanimous majority but we'll see what
[25:11.320 --> 25:15.040]  happens with that they point out the Titham amendment center spokesman said
[25:15.040 --> 25:18.920]  the New Jersey law is significant because it represents the first salvo by
[25:18.920 --> 25:23.760]  states against an unfettered flow of military equipment from Washington to
[25:23.760 --> 25:28.280]  state and local law enforcement he said good policing is about acting like
[25:28.280 --> 25:35.120]  police officers not a command and control military force exactly I want to
[25:35.120 --> 25:40.480]  talk about some of these other areas where we see a fight going on at the
[25:40.480 --> 25:44.480]  state level for our very rights before I do real quickly I just want to let you
[25:44.480 --> 25:50.920]  know that we have supermail vitality back in stock it was out of stock ran out
[25:50.920 --> 25:54.080]  very quickly with a special that we were running at the beginning of the year we
[25:54.080 --> 25:58.360]  now have the new formulation in stock very good reviews you've had over 90
[25:58.360 --> 26:05.080]  percent positive comments about it on our website it's something that you can
[26:05.080 --> 26:08.440]  use a lot of people say that's replacement for their coffee in the
[26:08.440 --> 26:12.520]  morning it's something that really gives you a boost to your immune system
[26:12.520 --> 26:16.960]  really gives you the kind of natural supplements that you need to have without
[26:16.960 --> 26:22.600]  the drawbacks of things like caffeine which I also use too much I think but
[26:22.600 --> 26:27.560]  try that it's now back in stock new supermail vitality that's new formulation
[26:27.560 --> 26:34.440]  it's at info wars life.com now getting back to the state fights that we have
[26:34.440 --> 26:38.680]  it's in terms of our rights we see these bills coming up on both sides of our
[26:38.680 --> 26:43.840]  rights for instance Colorado has a right to record bill it upholds the
[26:43.840 --> 26:47.600]  citizens fundamental right to record law enforcement I just reported yesterday
[26:47.600 --> 26:51.600]  that Montana they had an amazing bill that would say you have to get a
[26:51.600 --> 26:55.600]  privilege license from the police in order to film them and they retain final
[26:55.600 --> 27:02.120]  editorial content control of any content that you might publish or put up on
[27:02.120 --> 27:05.960]  the web that's for every kind of filmmaker and for citizen journalists
[27:05.960 --> 27:10.880]  that is a very dangerous law in Montana but there's a good one in Colorado and
[27:10.880 --> 27:16.040]  of course it was born out of the idea that we need to have the citizens
[27:16.040 --> 27:20.520]  watching the watchers the question is who watches the watchers well we can all
[27:20.520 --> 27:25.360]  watch the watchers when we have our own recording devices that we can freely
[27:25.360 --> 27:29.040]  record the police as they're going about their official business and that was
[27:29.040 --> 27:32.560]  the point of Montana it would prevent people from recording them when they're
[27:32.560 --> 27:36.560]  on official business we have no interest in recording the police when they're in
[27:36.560 --> 27:40.200]  private I mean they're the ones who want to record us in private we don't want to
[27:40.200 --> 27:44.560]  do that when they're operating as a private citizen but that Montana bill
[27:44.560 --> 27:49.640]  would prohibit you from doing it when they're on duty and a public capacity
[27:49.640 --> 27:55.080]  that of all things should be available for transparent observation and of
[27:55.080 --> 28:00.480]  course in Texas we've got a representative Jason Bilal Bilalba I
[28:00.480 --> 28:04.640]  guess is how you pronounce his name he's a Republican out of Dallas he wants to
[28:04.640 --> 28:09.280]  put in a penalty for filming the police here in Texas interesting that the same
[28:09.280 --> 28:17.880]  guy Jason Bilalba in Dallas also wants to mandate mental health screening for
[28:17.880 --> 28:23.600]  children in Texas this guy just can't get enough of big government that is an
[28:23.600 --> 28:28.360]  incredibly dangerous idea especially when you look at the effects of SSRI's
[28:28.360 --> 28:32.320]  that of course is what they're going to give your children if they screen them
[28:32.320 --> 28:36.280]  for psychological evaluation they hand that stuff out like candy we're gonna be
[28:36.280 --> 28:40.280]  right back or talk more about that and other pushes the Empire at the state

[32:27.840 --> 32:31.800]  equipment in the communities and of course in New Jersey they now have a
[32:31.800 --> 32:35.360]  bill that was passed in both houses unanimously going before Chris Christie
[32:35.360 --> 32:39.680]  that would essentially open up the process make it more transparent give the
[32:39.680 --> 32:44.480]  citizens more of a say so before this comes in instead of the citizens trying
[32:44.480 --> 32:47.720]  to get it out because you know there's been communities in California where
[32:47.720 --> 32:53.200]  they said we don't want this they got the local government to stand with them
[32:53.200 --> 32:56.040]  and say all right we're going to return this the Pentagon said no you can't
[32:56.040 --> 33:01.680]  return it you're not allowed to this is a white elephant program if there ever
[33:01.680 --> 33:06.920]  was one giving you this sacred elephant that you now have to feed because one of
[33:06.920 --> 33:10.640]  the reasons that they're giving these things out is because they rushed them
[33:10.640 --> 33:15.000]  to market to try to protect the troops in Iraq they're not very well designed
[33:15.000 --> 33:19.960]  they have horrendous maintenance issues horrendous maintenance costs the army
[33:19.960 --> 33:22.240]  doesn't want that on their books so they're pushing it out to the local
[33:22.240 --> 33:28.240]  communities keep them maintaining this they offered it for free to any of the
[33:28.240 --> 33:32.080]  allies that wanted to come and pick them up and nobody took them up on the
[33:32.080 --> 33:36.200]  offer that should tell you something so yeah they're basically a white elephant
[33:36.200 --> 33:40.080]  but it is also setting up a very dangerous precedent of militarizing the
[33:40.080 --> 33:44.120]  police of prepositioning equipment in these communities maintained at the
[33:44.120 --> 33:47.760]  expense of the communities while the Pentagon retains ownership so that's
[33:47.760 --> 33:49.960]  why they said you can't send it back we'll have to give you permission to
[33:49.960 --> 33:55.520]  send it back they don't own this they're not given this property it is loaned to
[33:55.520 --> 33:58.960]  them that's why they have to maintain it to a certain level and it's why it's
[33:58.960 --> 34:04.200]  there is so that it's going to continue to remain in the in the possession of
[34:04.200 --> 34:07.960]  the military essentially so they will they will decide how they're going to
[34:07.960 --> 34:13.360]  use it now we were talking about this pushback we have bills in various states
[34:13.360 --> 34:16.280]  where they want to prohibit filming the police we have other bills where they
[34:16.280 --> 34:20.480]  are standing behind the right of citizens to film the police and of course
[34:20.480 --> 34:26.120]  we've got someone here in Texas Jason Bilalba and Dallas a Republican who
[34:26.120 --> 34:30.160]  basically wants to penalize you for filming the police he also this is a
[34:30.160 --> 34:34.520]  story we had last Friday Texas lawmaker pushes mandatory mental health
[34:34.520 --> 34:41.000]  screening for children what an insane idea this guy needs to go for mental
[34:41.000 --> 34:45.360]  screening a Texas lawmaker has introduced draconian legislation that
[34:45.360 --> 34:48.160]  would force parents to have their children undergo mental health screening
[34:48.160 --> 34:51.880]  at the behest of teachers they say parents would have 30 days to comply with
[34:51.880 --> 34:56.680]  the ruling or the child will be sent to quote an alternative school well an
[34:56.680 --> 35:00.880]  alternative I sent my children to an alternative school we homeschooled them
[35:00.880 --> 35:04.960]  because I'm not going to have that kind of control exercised or my children
[35:04.960 --> 35:10.280]  understand it's a sigh out from the get-go my wife was a teacher has a
[35:10.280 --> 35:14.440]  master's degree in education actually and we understood exactly what they were
[35:14.440 --> 35:19.480]  doing with the bf skinner techniques the beyond freedom and dignity they don't
[35:19.480 --> 35:23.720]  think you should have freedom or dignity and if you don't believe me take a look
[35:23.720 --> 35:27.720]  at what they've turned the schools into I would not even recognize it from when
[35:27.720 --> 35:31.120]  I was in school and it didn't pass a sniff test for either one of us we
[35:31.120 --> 35:34.320]  absolutely would not put any of our children in school I understand people
[35:34.320 --> 35:38.840]  have issues they you know many single parents it's very difficult for you to
[35:38.840 --> 35:44.400]  homeschool get creative work with other people think outside the box don't
[35:44.400 --> 35:49.320]  put your kids in the box if you all you can because it will pay dividends in the
[35:49.320 --> 35:52.680]  long run with the relationships that you have with your children believe me it
[35:52.680 --> 35:58.520]  really will another article about how the schools are coming after parents
[35:58.520 --> 36:02.880]  here's one out of the UK several schools in England are threatening to call
[36:02.880 --> 36:07.960]  child protective services and have parents arrested why if they find out
[36:07.960 --> 36:12.440]  that your kids are playing video games at home like Grand Theft Auto or Call of
[36:12.440 --> 36:18.920]  Duty there you go so you know if your kids play outside call CPS because you're
[36:18.920 --> 36:23.600]  not watching out for them if they go to a playground call CPS if they walk home
[36:23.600 --> 36:29.320]  from the playground call CPS if they're playing the wrong video games in their
[36:29.320 --> 36:36.360]  homes call CPS you kind of get the idea that they want to control our kids kind
[36:36.360 --> 36:39.280]  of get the idea they want to take our kids away from the families if they
[36:39.280 --> 36:43.600]  can't control them in the families it couldn't be more obvious just connect
[36:43.600 --> 36:48.360]  the dots meanwhile look at this other article they came out let's say this is
[36:48.360 --> 36:53.520]  28th I think this is on Saturday is that right police watchdog to probe claims
[36:53.520 --> 36:57.520]  that a pedophile sergeant ordered junior officer to keep quiet after
[36:57.520 --> 37:03.080]  catching an MP with two boys at a sex party this is also out of the UK so here
[37:03.080 --> 37:07.720]  you go they're going to protect your children by sending in CPS and taking
[37:07.720 --> 37:10.320]  them away from you presumably if you let them play the wrong video games
[37:10.320 --> 37:17.800]  meanwhile meanwhile the police shut down investigation because this is a an
[37:17.800 --> 37:22.200]  MP that's caught with a sex party with little boys and we've seen this happen
[37:22.200 --> 37:28.080]  in the UK as well with the Jimmy Seville situation after his history was made
[37:28.080 --> 37:33.680]  public we realized that it had been shut down many times several times by
[37:33.680 --> 37:37.800]  Scotland Yard though higher ups shut down the investigations of those who are
[37:37.800 --> 37:41.640]  lower down who saw something started to come after it as they should and then it
[37:41.640 --> 37:46.800]  was shut down by those who are high up just as we saw the BBC do that they had
[37:46.800 --> 37:50.160]  some people that had created a documentary exposing his pedophile
[37:50.160 --> 37:55.480]  crimes and that was spiked by the BBC and then Danny Cohen the guy who just
[37:55.480 --> 38:01.960]  shut down their most popular show Top Gear he wound up running a retrospect
[38:01.960 --> 38:05.920]  that was celebrating the life of Jimmy Seville as if none of this stuff had
[38:05.920 --> 38:10.800]  ever happened but boy if you offend their political correctness if you offend
[38:10.800 --> 38:14.520]  their religion of climate change you're gone it doesn't matter if you got an
[38:14.520 --> 38:18.400]  audience of 350 million people because they could care less about that I mean
[38:18.400 --> 38:21.400]  they're going to get their money one way or the other but in this case we've
[38:21.400 --> 38:24.280]  got a police watchdog who's going to examine claims that a pedophile
[38:24.280 --> 38:28.600]  sergeant ordered a junior officer not to tell anyone after catching Cyril Smith
[38:28.600 --> 38:34.720]  at a sex party with two boys because Cyril Smith was an MP a member of
[38:34.720 --> 38:39.680]  parliament he was threatened to get this with the official secrets act so I
[38:39.680 --> 38:46.000]  guess if you're a politician your pedophile parties are official secrets
[38:46.000 --> 38:49.840]  they're not just secret they're official secrets and you know everything is
[38:49.840 --> 38:54.680]  national security to a corrupt government we see this everywhere everyone
[38:54.680 --> 38:59.560]  that we talk to now in government it doesn't matter if it's some local airport
[38:59.560 --> 39:04.760]  authority they want to invoke secrecy and national security as if they're the
[39:04.760 --> 39:08.840]  CIA you know actually I don't think the CIA and I have that kind of secrecy I
[39:08.840 --> 39:13.400]  disagree with Richard Burr the new Republican chair of the Senate
[39:13.400 --> 39:17.680]  Intelligence Committee he says we're not ever going to have any oversight of the
[39:17.680 --> 39:21.160]  NSA or the CIA or any of these secret organizations we should never even talk
[39:21.160 --> 39:28.960]  about any of this no you need to you cannot have a secretive black government
[39:28.960 --> 39:33.440]  doing black operations and not talk about it and you know it's not just
[39:33.440 --> 39:37.240]  England where they have these problems where they have what they want to ban
[39:37.240 --> 39:43.000]  video games or send CPSN after you it's also here in the US we've got the guy
[39:43.000 --> 39:48.400]  who's going to be replacing Harry Reid Chuck Schumer and there was a funny
[39:48.400 --> 39:52.600]  article that was up on reason with a list of all the things that Chuck Schumer
[39:52.600 --> 39:59.680]  wants to ban because this guy is one of the most authoritarian nanny state
[39:59.680 --> 40:04.200]  people you can ever imagine so you thought we were we're getting an
[40:04.200 --> 40:08.440]  improvement by getting rid of Harry Reid no here's Chuck Schumer some of the
[40:08.440 --> 40:11.960]  things that he's done he wanted to ban high-powered green laser pointers he
[40:11.960 --> 40:17.200]  wants to ban powdered alcohol he wants to ban powdered caffeine he wants to ban
[40:17.200 --> 40:21.640]  alcoholic energy drinks hey you get the idea this guy is like stuck in alcohol
[40:21.640 --> 40:26.920]  prohibition and we'll talk about that next he says Bitcoin is money laundering
[40:26.920 --> 40:34.780]  ban it okay fast food bread ban it 25 to life a video game and that too I don't
[40:34.780 --> 40:39.960]  even know what it is but this guy is always trying to tell us how to live
[40:39.960 --> 40:44.320]  our lives you know when you've got the government constantly telling you how to
[40:44.320 --> 40:49.360]  live your life you're not free are you when you have a militarized police force
[40:49.360 --> 40:54.160]  driving around m-wraps SWAT teaming people you're not free either and I
[40:54.160 --> 40:57.960]  think one of the things that really puzzles me about the war on drugs about
[40:57.960 --> 41:05.240]  drug prohibition is just the absurdity of civil asset forfeiture you know we had
[41:05.240 --> 41:10.560]  an article earlier this last week we talked to Paul Joseph Watson on Friday
[41:10.560 --> 41:16.120]  about it about the government criminalizing people that had $5,000
[41:16.120 --> 41:19.800]  of cash that they would take out of the bank they wanted the bank to report
[41:19.800 --> 41:23.640]  this as suspicious activity and of course they're pushing these suspicious
[41:23.640 --> 41:28.040]  activity reports and getting over a million of them a year from the banks
[41:28.040 --> 41:31.160]  it used to be that they would look at the money that you were depositing in the
[41:31.160 --> 41:36.680]  bank because I said you know we got to be on the guard for money laundering so
[41:36.680 --> 41:41.640]  if somebody is putting more than $10,000 in the bank and cash that's
[41:41.640 --> 41:46.920]  suspicious if they have deposits that would total more than $10,000 over a
[41:46.920 --> 41:51.400]  certain period of time that's suspicious too so you need to file a
[41:51.400 --> 41:56.120]  suspicious activity report and they have actually used that to go in and
[41:56.120 --> 42:00.600]  confiscate people's money saying that they were structuring their deposits
[42:00.600 --> 42:04.520]  the whole point of that would be that you would look to see if it really is
[42:04.520 --> 42:07.240]  suspicious if they're involved in criminal activity but if they're not
[42:07.240 --> 42:10.680]  involved in criminal activity they ought to be left alone but they're using it to
[42:10.680 --> 42:14.920]  steal the business steal the money of a lot of businesses small businesses that
[42:14.920 --> 42:18.320]  are in the restaurant business that's predominantly cash putting these people
[42:18.320 --> 42:23.400]  out of business putting people in jail with these structuring charges this is
[42:23.400 --> 42:26.000]  the way it was put in one of the articles that we had an info wars last
[42:26.000 --> 42:32.480]  time last week a man Charles Hugh Smith wrote this his publication is of two
[42:32.480 --> 42:35.960]  minds listen to the way he put this he said did you know that if you deposit
[42:35.960 --> 42:39.120]  too much money and modest sums the government of Iran steals all your
[42:39.120 --> 42:42.840]  deposits he then said did you know that if you're caught with any drug
[42:42.840 --> 42:47.200]  paraphernalia in your vehicle the government of Iran steals your vehicle
[42:47.200 --> 42:53.000]  pity the poor Iranian people they live in a Kafkaist nightmare where
[42:53.000 --> 42:57.440]  suspicion alone justifies the government stealing from its citizens he says oh
[42:57.440 --> 43:02.240]  sorry reader I was just kind of teasing it that's not in Iran that's not the
[43:02.240 --> 43:05.440]  Iranian government the source of all evil that we're supposed to go to war
[43:05.440 --> 43:10.880]  with no that's your government in America these are tricks that are set up to
[43:10.880 --> 43:16.920]  steal from the American people and you know when we reported about that incident
[43:16.920 --> 43:24.560]  of saying that they wanted the people taking $5,000 out of their account and
[43:24.560 --> 43:28.960]  think about the fact that this money was already vetted when you put it into
[43:28.960 --> 43:34.120]  your account right there he looked at it and said okay this looks suspicious
[43:34.120 --> 43:38.680]  he's putting cash into the into the bank let's notify the Homeland Security
[43:38.680 --> 43:42.200]  and the FBI and everybody and have it do an audit on this guy because he put
[43:42.200 --> 43:45.880]  cash in the bank now you're taking the cash out in a smaller amount and that's
[43:45.880 --> 43:52.600]  suspicious too using any excuse they can to take your money now this
[43:52.600 --> 43:58.600]  announcement was made at a meeting it was a conference by an organization called
[43:58.600 --> 44:07.280]  the Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists and ACAMS and
[44:07.280 --> 44:10.840]  this is where an assistant attorney general went to make this announcement
[44:10.840 --> 44:15.960]  about the $5,000 and one of the things he was also talking about there and I
[44:15.960 --> 44:19.480]  thought it was kind of interesting that there's an entire industry that has come
[44:19.480 --> 44:24.760]  up to watch people putting money into the bank and taking money out of the bank
[44:24.760 --> 44:29.800]  are we like East German Stasi society here I mean that's what this has
[44:29.800 --> 44:35.080]  turned into we have an entire industry people making a living being snitches
[44:35.080 --> 44:39.480]  looking at anti-money laundering and of course they're not doing a very good
[44:39.480 --> 44:44.000]  job of it for the big banks they have taken cash away from a lot of innocent
[44:44.000 --> 44:47.320]  people who are not involved in any criminal activity they put people in
[44:47.320 --> 44:54.560]  jail but you know when HSBC does it and launders money for drug organizations drug
[44:54.560 --> 44:59.920]  cartels or for terrorist groups they get a slap on the hand it was just a few
[44:59.920 --> 45:06.160]  weeks profits that they were fined nobody went to jail and they even set up a
[45:06.160 --> 45:09.480]  an organization we had Everett Stern who was one of the people that worked for
[45:09.480 --> 45:15.720]  them after they were put on probation they created a new anti-money laundering
[45:15.720 --> 45:20.520]  department they added a lot more warm bodies but he testified that an alleged
[45:20.520 --> 45:24.280]  that they were not training anybody he even went further he said that they were
[45:24.280 --> 45:28.560]  taking their keyword search that would identify certain suspicious organizations
[45:28.560 --> 45:31.720]  certain drug cartels certain terrorist organizations and they were putting
[45:31.720 --> 45:36.680]  spaces and periods in there so that the they wouldn't get a match that's what
[45:36.680 --> 45:43.040]  Everett Stern alleged when he blew the whistle on HSBC but you know it is
[45:43.040 --> 45:46.880]  something that they're that we're seeing a pushback again at the state level it's
[45:46.880 --> 45:50.400]  nobody has a problem with it it seems like at the federal level except for
[45:50.400 --> 45:56.920]  Rand Paul and a few who have come up with a piece of legislation called actually
[45:56.920 --> 46:01.400]  that's the careers is actually for marijuana but they've actually come up
[46:01.400 --> 46:05.880]  with something I forget the name of legislation they would stop this kind of
[46:05.880 --> 46:12.320]  confiscation of equipment of personal inanimate objects charging them with the
[46:12.320 --> 46:17.920]  crime that is the heart of civil asset forfeiture we also see a pushback at the
[46:17.920 --> 46:22.520]  state level and we had the Wyoming legislature come in and just like we
[46:22.520 --> 46:26.400]  saw with this bill to push back the militarization of the police in New
[46:26.400 --> 46:33.160]  Jersey it was also passed in Wyoming and yet the governor there vetoed them
[46:33.160 --> 46:39.120]  stopping the civil asset forfeiture program he said no that is a right in
[46:39.120 --> 46:43.520]  other words the government has rights but you don't have property rights that's
[46:43.520 --> 46:47.480]  what that governor is saying he also said drug he said crimes should not pay
[46:47.480 --> 46:52.800]  especially drug crime but actually what he was doing was stealing from people and
[46:52.800 --> 46:57.240]  saying that they could get away with it so we see that this is also coming up in
[46:57.240 --> 47:00.760]  New Mexico and New Mexico it was unanimously passed by both the house
[47:00.760 --> 47:05.080]  and the Senate but the governor there is strangely quiet as people have
[47:05.080 --> 47:10.520]  reported not saying whether or not she is going to decide this legislation that
[47:10.520 --> 47:15.560]  would stop civil asset forfeiture it's a novel idea that we should be found
[47:15.560 --> 47:21.080]  guilty of a crime before they confiscate our property it's an idea that goes all
[47:21.080 --> 47:26.160]  the way back to the beginning of the kinds of rule of law and respect for
[47:26.160 --> 47:31.120]  individual freedom goes back several hundred years goes back to running me to
[47:31.120 --> 47:36.680]  those kinds of rights to establish trial by jury to establish the presumption of
[47:36.680 --> 47:41.800]  innocence to make sure that people are not given excessive fines to make sure
[47:41.800 --> 47:45.280]  that they don't have their property taken that they're not put in jail for
[47:45.280 --> 47:48.200]  things that are not fine that are not crimes and that's what we see happening
[47:48.200 --> 47:53.640]  with civil asset forfeiture but I think one of the things that really concerns
[47:53.640 --> 47:58.280]  me and of course we're seeing this happen at multiple in multiple states we
[47:58.280 --> 48:02.120]  see some good moves towards shutting down prohibition understand that
[48:02.120 --> 48:07.840]  prohibition now as it exists is 80% targeted towards marijuana but a large
[48:07.840 --> 48:13.320]  part of this is targeted towards people who are not violent but they're put in
[48:13.320 --> 48:17.720]  jail for a mandatory minimum period of time thanks to the Ronald Reagan
[48:17.720 --> 48:22.440]  administration something we didn't even do with alcohol prohibition and as I
[48:22.440 --> 48:27.200]  point out earlier it seems to me like Republicans could understand that
[48:27.200 --> 48:32.720]  property rights are fundamental to you being a free person Republicans are all
[48:32.720 --> 48:38.240]  about property rights and yet they have enabled this civil asset forfeiture to
[48:38.240 --> 48:43.360]  go on and destroy property rights in the name of the failed war on drugs do you
[48:43.360 --> 48:46.640]  understand this has been going on for over 40 years do you understand this
[48:46.640 --> 48:52.720]  had its roots in the UN ten years before Nixon declared the war on drugs ten
[48:52.720 --> 48:59.080]  years before we had our four different schedules we had the UN come in with
[48:59.080 --> 49:04.000]  exactly that same legislation just like they do with agenda 21 with many other
[49:04.000 --> 49:09.120]  issues like gun control they create an agenda and then they wait for the
[49:09.120 --> 49:13.200]  individual states to enact it into law and that's what we did here in this
[49:13.200 --> 49:16.320]  country we even took the same drugs and put them on the same schedules and of
[49:16.320 --> 49:22.680]  course we have the idea that marijuana has no medical uses so therefore it is
[49:22.680 --> 49:28.000]  a schedule one drug that is the legislation that Rand Paul is talking
[49:28.000 --> 49:33.520]  about in terms of taking it off of a schedule one drug he has two Democrat
[49:33.520 --> 49:38.160]  co-sponsors with that that would have huge implications that would even make
[49:38.160 --> 49:43.320]  it available for you to get some help financially when you take that drug but
[49:43.320 --> 49:48.000]  it would it would recognize an obvious fact that it has real medical uses we're
[49:48.000 --> 49:55.400]  gonna talk about that this hour GCN brought to you by let's say the highest quality smokeless cigarettes e-liquids e-cig refills car

[53:14.560 --> 53:19.520]  Salenty about that before I get back to what's happened in North Carolina with
[53:19.520 --> 53:22.560]  medical marijuana I just want to let you know that we have a new product course
[53:22.560 --> 53:27.040]  we've been talking about winter Sun vitamin D3 it's the latest info wars
[53:27.040 --> 53:31.760]  life formulation we have just introduced that but it's selling very rapidly it
[53:31.760 --> 53:36.640]  will sell out pretty soon with this first run you get a liquid vitamin D3 it's
[53:36.640 --> 53:41.720]  not the synthetic D2 you get D3 that contains a powerful 2000 international
[53:41.720 --> 53:46.040]  units per single dose we know that vitamin D is essential for everything
[53:46.040 --> 53:50.360]  from bone health to boosting the immune system and maintaining muscle strength
[53:50.360 --> 53:54.560]  and remember that just because it's not winter anymore most people are not
[53:54.560 --> 53:59.720]  getting much sunlight even those who out in getting a sun are not producing the
[53:59.720 --> 54:04.000]  levels of vitamin D in many cases that they need because of nutritional
[54:04.000 --> 54:10.160]  deficiencies so you can get your D3 at info wars life dot-com that's winter
[54:10.160 --> 54:16.000]  sun vitamin D3 that was brought to my attention I have a friend in North
[54:16.000 --> 54:20.320]  Carolina that has a news aggregation site kind of like the drudge report but
[54:20.320 --> 54:26.360]  just focusing on state issues and it was brought to my attention that medical
[54:26.360 --> 54:30.720]  marijuana was just recently shot down it was a very rough fight actually people
[54:30.720 --> 54:34.440]  got very angry about it and I think they should I think you should get angry
[54:34.440 --> 54:38.560]  about it because you need to understand that as we get angry about the
[54:38.560 --> 54:42.000]  government taking away our informed consent and say no we're going to shoot
[54:42.000 --> 54:45.120]  you up with a vaccine whether you agree with that or not whether we have your
[54:45.120 --> 54:49.360]  consent or not whether we give you any information about it or not whether we
[54:49.360 --> 54:53.240]  give the vaccine pharmaceutical companies legal immunity in a vaccine
[54:53.240 --> 54:58.920]  court or not if they have legal immunity if they need legal immunity
[54:58.920 --> 55:03.800]  doesn't that tell you something about the danger of the vaccines that they had
[55:03.800 --> 55:07.000]  to create the vaccine court in order to protect the pharmaceutical companies
[55:07.000 --> 55:12.960]  anyway if they can mandate vaccines they can also prohibit you from taking
[55:12.960 --> 55:16.160]  medicine that you want to take see that's the flip side of both of these
[55:16.160 --> 55:21.560]  things and that's really what's going on with medical marijuana now I talked on
[55:21.560 --> 55:26.600]  the info wars actually it was on the radio we talked to David Strickland
[55:26.600 --> 55:31.160]  here in Texas a very compassionate Christian who made a Christian argument
[55:31.160 --> 55:36.800]  for legalizing marijuana he talked about people in his district who are
[55:36.800 --> 55:41.760]  suffering horribly one of them was a child who'd been damaged by vaccines
[55:41.760 --> 55:46.840]  the other people who got the batch of vaccines died this child has suffered
[55:46.840 --> 55:49.880]  with seizures all their life the only way they could get any relief the only
[55:49.880 --> 55:54.040]  thing that ever gave them any relief was medical marijuana that name was
[55:54.040 --> 55:57.600]  actually David Simpson sorry David Simpson not David Strickland yes is
[55:57.600 --> 56:04.120]  David Simpson is the representative out of Longview Texas anyway he made a
[56:04.120 --> 56:07.480]  point of making a Christian argument because he understood as we all need
[56:07.480 --> 56:12.240]  to understand that many of the people who oppose this most adamantly are
[56:12.240 --> 56:17.760]  Christians and at this hearing that they had in North Carolina they had this is
[56:17.760 --> 56:20.280]  something that was put up predominantly along party lines there's
[56:20.280 --> 56:24.280]  Democrats who put it up and Republicans who shot it down they say spouses of
[56:24.280 --> 56:27.320]  injured military veterans testified several people said they use marijuana
[56:27.320 --> 56:31.080]  to treat chronic or chronic pain or symptoms from diseases they had an 84
[56:31.080 --> 56:35.560]  year old woman who said she had always had an active life but she now had worn
[56:35.560 --> 56:39.360]  out discs in her spine suffering from a lot of pain couldn't find anything that
[56:39.360 --> 56:42.840]  helped it about two years ago she said she rubbed cannabis infused ointment on
[56:42.840 --> 56:46.920]  her back knees and ankles she says now I can walk around I can sleep better I
[56:46.920 --> 56:53.200]  don't have to use a cart to get around so that kind of testimony was given at
[56:53.200 --> 56:57.160]  the legislature and a guy who's with an organization called the Christian Action
[56:57.160 --> 57:02.760]  League his name is Reverend Mark Creech wrote an op-ed about what a rough day he
[57:02.760 --> 57:10.480]  had had listening to these people and basically blowing them off as he pushed
[57:10.480 --> 57:14.800]  for drug prohibition and I'm gonna read you his letter when we come back we're
[57:14.800 --> 57:18.560]  out of time in this segment but I'll read you what he wrote about what a rough

[59:15.840 --> 59:20.720]  joined in the next segment with jeril salinity of trends research just want
[59:20.720 --> 59:25.720]  to finish up in this segment with what I began talking about the hearings about
[59:25.720 --> 59:30.040]  medical marijuana that were shut down in north carolina last week and an
[59:30.040 --> 59:34.520]  editorial that I saw by a reverend mark creche who is with the christian
[59:34.520 --> 59:39.440]  action league talking about what a rough day he had at the legislature now of
[59:39.440 --> 59:43.520]  course the christian action league they self-described themselves as growing out
[59:43.520 --> 59:48.840]  of the days of prohibition they grew out of the anti saloon movement but in
[59:48.840 --> 59:52.320]  1958 they say the charter the organization was amended to expand the
[59:52.320 --> 59:57.040]  scope of its ministry yeah by the time by 1958 everybody had realized that
[59:57.040 --> 01:00:02.560]  alcohol prohibition was a really bad idea it hadn't helped anybody and so they
[01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:06.800]  branched out into other things like preventing marijuana because it didn't
[01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:10.440]  learn the lesson from that so let's talk about what he had to say that it's
[01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:16.080]  amazing to me that he puts himself in here as the victim he's perfectly
[01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:19.880]  healthy he's not the victim the victims are the people who need the medicine that
[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:23.680]  he's denying them and I have to say that just as a matter of principles I said
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:27.400]  in the last segment any government that can deny medication to you by the same
[01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:32.080]  principle can force you to take medication that's how we get to informed
[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:37.440]  consent being removed from vaccines this is what he said said Wednesday was a
[01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:40.960]  rough day for me at the North Carolina legislature the pro cannabis forces
[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:44.960]  filled nearly every seat in the room there was heart-wrenching testimony from
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:48.600]  18 of the bills proponents they testified of debilitating diseases from
[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:52.960]  which they or family members suffered each of them said marijuana had helped
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:56.920]  them with their symptoms and they implored representatives to legalize the
[01:00:56.920 --> 01:01:01.600]  drug in North Carolina for medicinal use didn't have any effect on Reverend
[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:06.160]  Creech though you know it was a heart-wrenching testimony but it didn't
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:12.160]  enrich his heart let me say to him and he says a lot of people say that we are
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:18.880]  we're not compassionate they were very hostile towards us I don't use marijuana
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:22.640]  recreationally I don't have anybody in my family that needs it for medicine but
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:26.520]  if they did and that was the only thing that helped them I would be hostile to
[01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:31.280]  somebody who presumed to tell me that I couldn't take it and I don't care who
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:34.520]  this guy is I don't care if he's representing some church or if he's
[01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:40.480]  representing the government nobody has that right to make that decision but me
[01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:44.360]  medicine is something that I should be allowed to take this is what he says I
[01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:47.760]  wish I could say that such hostility never bothers me when standing for the
[01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:55.160]  truth what truth is he standing for what he is doing is denying the testimony
[01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:59.400]  of these people these people come in and say nothing helped me accept this and
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:04.280]  terrible testimony talking about the pain and the suffering that they or
[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:08.120]  family members have gone through and he just blows that off let me tell you
[01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:13.280]  something do you think that your Christian testimony Reverend Creech is
[01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:16.640]  going to reach anybody when you blow their testimony off you're going to
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:20.280]  tell them about the love of Christ and the compassion of Christ and you're
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:23.760]  going to come across like this where you could care less about what they're
[01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:27.840]  saying don't give any credibility to what they're saying you're going to ram
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:30.960]  the government down their throat you say you want to be salt and light you're
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:35.600]  nothing but a badge and a gun to these people that's what you are you think
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:39.960]  that Christ can't transform lives this is essentially a spiritual problem a
[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:45.000]  psychological problem it is not a law enforcement problem you have made it a
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:50.160]  law enforcement problem because your God is too small your God is the government
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:54.600]  your God permit that you serve this is what he says I and my fellow Christian
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:59.760]  colleagues no don't include me in that who opposed medical marijuana for North
[01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:03.240]  Carolina genuinely care about the affliction of others but medicine is
[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:06.560]  not something to be decided at the ballot box or a judiciary committee at the
[01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:10.560]  state legislature now that agree on okay he thinks though that it needs to be
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:16.360]  established by some guys in white coats okay this is something that the AMA
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:20.240]  according to him the AMA and the pharmaceutical companies are going to go
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:24.200]  out and they're going to test this drug that they can't sell because they don't
[01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:27.360]  own it and that's why we've never had these tests they're going to go out and

[01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:29.040]  a very interesting predictions while we went to have him on several years ago
[01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:33.200]  about what's going on right now with Saudi Arabia and Yemeni he predicted
[01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:37.960]  that quote cross-border fighting between Saudi Arabia and Yemeni rebels is
[01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:41.760]  precisely the type of conflict that could destabilize the world's oil markets
[01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:45.920]  should the fighting intensify the Saudis risk and attack on their oil
[01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:49.800]  facilities which could curtail supplies drive prices higher and seriously
[01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:54.600]  damage the already imperiled world economy so joining us now is Gerald
[01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:59.960]  Salenty welcome Gerald thank you for having me interesting forecast and it's
[01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:04.960]  interesting what's happened this last week with Saudi Arabia going after the
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:08.600]  Yemeni rebels break that down for the audience exactly what's happened there
[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:12.920]  and what you think is going to be the consequences of that yes that quote that
[01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:23.040]  you read was from our Trends Journal back in 2009 and the the Houthi insurgency
[01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:27.440]  in Yemen this has been going on for decades and what people don't understand
[01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:33.600]  is that you know this all began with the car of the Ottoman Empire after World
[01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:39.760]  War one and there's destabilization in that area ever since so this isn't a
[01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:46.560]  new occurrence but David what's going on is being sold to the public as Houthis
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:52.560]  with the Iranians and the Sunnis or you know they're the Saudis and they're the
[01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:57.760]  good folks that the United States is helping on this deal here is the
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:04.560]  outrage and the overt imperialism that's happening in this country and
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:10.560]  colonization that you have no part of the clown that plays ambassador to the
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:15.920]  United States from Saudi Arabia made the announcement last week you know
[01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:21.800]  where from no not the capital of Saudi Arabia from the capital of the United
[01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:29.320]  States Washington this guy gets on the news at a Washington DC I mean we're
[01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:35.520]  talking about okay boys and girls if you believe that the kid the prince the
[01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:40.520]  princess kissed the frog and the frog was really the king then you'll like the
[01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:45.000]  name the king of Saudi Arabia but how about let's calling him a dictator
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:49.840]  this country that these this family has been ruling this joint they make the
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:10:00.800]  announcement that our king and royal family is going to restore the the guy
[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:07.160]  Hadi who the United States and Saudi Arabia propped up there in Yemen as the
[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:12.080]  new dictator following the old dictator they call it quote the legitimate
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:17.560]  government now let's get this straight Saudi Arabia is one country Yemen's
[01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:24.000]  another country who is Saudi Arabia to say what should be going on in Yemen so
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:28.840]  you can you can see what's going on here and again this was done from the
[01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:35.840]  United States it's a disgrace that they let this clown address out from the
[01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:42.840]  Washington DC that Saudi Arabia is going to restore the legitimate government
[01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:48.600]  of Yemen what are they going to do it in between beheading people what did they
[01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:54.400]  behead about 34 ready this year the dictatorship of Saudi Arabia is saying
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:11:00.400]  what should be going on in Yemen and the United States is providing intelligence
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:05.960]  and reconnaissance information to help Dark King oh yeah they're absolutely
[01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:10.640]  joined at the hip of the US intelligence agencies in Saudi Arabia I thought it
[01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:14.960]  was interesting Glenn Greenwall I'll paraphrase him here but it in terms of
[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:18.200]  this announcement you know as you point out the amazing announcement that they
[01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:22.800]  don't they they announced that they're invading into Yemen not from the capital
[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:26.000]  Saudi Arabia but from Washington and Glenn Greenwall said you know you're
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:31.560]  pretty far into an empire when they start a new war and it isn't even
[01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:35.320]  newsworthy they don't even pick this information up throughout most of the
[01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:40.920]  news cycle press no and then look look what else is going on you have ten other
[01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:46.800]  countries the so-called Arab League that overthrew Qaddafi destabilizing Syria
[01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:51.160]  you know that this thing's been going on for how long and now they're invading
[01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:55.800]  another country and people don't have any idea of the history of this I want to
[01:11:55.800 --> 01:12:01.240]  read to you two quotes to put this into context because the prostitute media or
[01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:05.960]  is Alex Jones called the media whores and I'm a hundred percent behind them
[01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:12.600]  their media whores they're no more than low-lifes that suck up bow down to pass
[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:17.240]  out the information that's given to them so they could serve their corporate
[01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:24.080]  whores their corporate whore masters and and the Washington John's this is
[01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:33.760]  from this is from the former American ambassador to Yemen all right so now
[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:39.640]  here's a guy that you would expect to toe the line his name is Steven set she's
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:49.440]  s e c h e and he said that the Houthis had rarely had rarely defined their
[01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:56.240]  struggles in Yemen in sectarian terms and that their ties to Iran had been
[01:12:56.240 --> 01:13:02.400]  overstated by Gulf nations quote the Saudis and the Sunnis have made this a
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:09.240]  sectarian issue he said this military campaign is the Sunni world saying to
[01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:17.200]  Iran get out of our backyard as he's saying here there is no connection to
[01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:24.000]  further make the non-connection between Iran and the Houthis this is from
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:30.720]  Philip Hammond the British Foreign Secretary he said last Friday the Houthis
[01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:38.120]  are not Iranian proxies so you're hearing it right from the top but they're
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:44.520]  selling it as that so we could easily hate them because Iranians bed them
[01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:50.240]  Saudis are good I mean after all you saw our president bow down and kiss the
[01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:57.640]  Saudis ring you saw all of these past Secretary of States go over and salute
[01:13:57.640 --> 01:14:04.320]  the new king you think that everybody would be going there to kiss the ring
[01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:11.200]  of the beheadering chief if their major export was broccoli the immorality of
[01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:17.520]  this is disgusting yeah it's amazing that you know we've seen these beheading
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:22.840]  videos from ISIS many of them look very staged but there are real beheadings
[01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:27.880]  going on in Saudi Arabia constantly they've beheaded far more people than
[01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:32.920]  ISIS or ISIL ever have and yet there are hard and fast allies I think it's also
[01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:36.520]  interesting Gerald that nobody in America in the general public they look
[01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:41.800]  at this as some monolithic Muslim state and they they have no idea of the
[01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:45.280]  differences and the infighting that's going on with these with these different
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:49.760]  factions within Islam between the Sunnis the Shias the Wahhabists they have no
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:55.000]  idea what's behind that they have no idea about the geopolitical alliances
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:59.400]  that are being made with the US with Saudi Arabia they're just going with
[01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:04.480]  whatever they're told on Fox News Fox News and all the rest I mean you read
[01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:09.400]  every one of these articles and it's Iranian back Houthis yeah and it's the
[01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:13.920]  furthest thing from the truth this thing has been going on now for decades the
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:20.440]  revolution really began to break out in the 1960s and you've had this guy who
[01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:28.560]  left Salah he was he was dictator in chief from 1990 to 2011 you know so
[01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:32.760]  this thing's been going on for a long time and by the way back in the 60s
[01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:38.320]  Egypt tried to invade Yemen now remember this is the poorest country in the area
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:42.600]  you know these Saudis are bombing the place they're bombing mud huts they've
[01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:47.800]  killed over I think it's about 120 people already and and it's civilians so
[01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:52.480]  when the Saudis tried to do it they call it I mean the Egyptians when they
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:58.160]  tried to invade back in the 60s they called it the Egyptian Vietnam
[01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:06.680]  Egypt lost about 26,000 men and and back when I wrote that piece in the
[01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:12.840]  trends journal that you quoted from you already saw the Saudis try to invade
[01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:18.960]  that area of northern Yemen where it borders the Saudi border and they lost
[01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:26.540]  about 140 men the Saudis did so nobody this now here's the blowback David that
[01:16:26.540 --> 01:16:30.980]  no one's talking about you know as they used to say in the Bronx paybacks a
[01:16:30.980 --> 01:16:37.320]  bitch you're blowing up this joint you have several million Yemenis living in
[01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:42.680]  Saudi Arabia all of a sudden you're gonna start seeing what they're going to
[01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:49.280]  call terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia so all of a sudden they start blowing up
[01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:55.280]  oil fields or blowing up darkings people and you're gonna see this thing
[01:16:55.280 --> 01:17:01.720]  really start to expand talking about we've already seen a lot of the
[01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:06.680]  American drone strikes done by Obama into Yemen haven't we yes and again
[01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:12.680]  that's the reason why another reason why they hate us but hey Obama I mean you
[01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:16.440]  know this is it's all against international law there is into no
[01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:21.120]  international law hey where's the United Nations on this deal what of all
[01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:27.240]  a sudden the Secretary General has locked your you got 10 countries invading a
[01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:32.280]  sovereign nation who's done nothing to those other countries and there's no
[01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:37.920]  outrage all they can keep talking about is this you know this German airliner
[01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:44.040]  that went down but but all these other people being slaughtered and an attack
[01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:50.160]  by foreign nations into another nation that's not making the news in an area
[01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:56.600]  that has become totally destabilized with the war in Iraq the war in Libya the
[01:17:56.600 --> 01:18:02.240]  war in Syria now in Yemen and oh in Egypt by the way they're getting
[01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:08.200]  re-involved in this as well you know the dictators excuse me the new
[01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:13.840]  president I forgot it was a military coup but we're not allowed to say that
[01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:18.880]  because so we could keep giving them our money although that's against the law in
[01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:24.520]  the United States they're involved in this now as well so this thing is going
[01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:30.840]  to destabilize the entire region and you're going to start seeing blowback
[01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:34.680]  big time yeah I want to I want to continue this as we come back from the
[01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:39.120]  break as you pointed out this was Egypt's Vietnam the question is will it be
[01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:43.160]  another Vietnam for America will America get pulled into this conflict along
[01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:48.520]  with Saudi Arabia our close allies they will be talking to Gerald Salinity of

[01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:05.520]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and we're talking to Gerald
[01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:09.920]  Salente publisher of Trends Journal TrendsResearch.com we've been talking
[01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:14.560]  about the situation in Yemen and of course the United States government has
[01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:19.440]  been there for quite some time with an assassination campaign and as part of
[01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:24.320]  that we've had a massive number of civilian casualties innocent people
[01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:30.760]  dying of course in Pentagon speak we have a disposition matrix that caused
[01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:34.160]  collateral damage I guess that's just the way we would dismiss all this pain
[01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:39.480]  and suffering that we're causing all of the pushback the blowback that is going
[01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:43.320]  to be coming our way from people that we have oppressed and attacked and now
[01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:48.800]  we're doing this as part of Saudi Arabia is being sold as being against the
[01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:53.640]  Iranians but Gerald predicted this six years ago in TrendsResearch and we're
[01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:56.680]  going to get back to that in just a moment before we do I want to let you
[01:23:56.680 --> 01:24:00.880]  know that we now have supermail vitality back in stock it was sold out we had it
[01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:03.440]  on special beginning of the year so it's been sold out for several weeks but it's
[01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:09.080]  now back in a new formulation it's new more powerful more enhanced and we're
[01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:12.560]  getting very good feedback we've had a lot of reviews we put both the good and
[01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:17.720]  the bad reviews up on the site we've got over 90% positive people are saying
[01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:21.040]  that the lot of people are saying they find it as replacement to coffee in the
[01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:24.280]  morning for energy so that's a supermail vitality you can find that at
[01:24:24.280 --> 01:24:29.480]  infowarslife.com Gerald you were pointing out just before in the last
[01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:35.360]  segment that Egypt has already gone into Yemen once decide that they would be
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:39.240]  able to put that down it was Egypt's Vietnam I think it's very interesting
[01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:43.640]  especially as we see this training that's going on with Jade Helm and others
[01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:49.400]  over and over again we see that the big the big military is as part of this
[01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:53.960]  asymmetric warfare they're losing these wars again and again and again even
[01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:58.640]  though they have the massive military equipment the massive armies people who
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:02.000]  are being oppressed will fight to the last word not to say that there won't be
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:06.800]  a massive casualty won't be very unbalanced but they will continue to
[01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:11.240]  fight because they're the ones who are being oppressed they're the ones who are
[01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:15.240]  being invaded they're the ones who are being called insurgents in their own
[01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:19.400]  country I don't think this is gonna go well but but Gerald do you think we're
[01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:23.240]  gonna get drawn into this conflict is it going to be another Vietnam for us I
[01:25:23.240 --> 01:25:28.280]  don't I don't think with so-called boots on the ground they like bombing you
[01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:33.520]  know drowning in bomb strikes and it also should be you made a good point
[01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:40.240]  David in that you said despite all this money being spent and correct me if I'm
[01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:45.280]  wrong in paraphrasing what you said there is no victories to show for it
[01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:51.120]  yeah exactly right all right now let's get this straight okay everybody that's
[01:25:51.120 --> 01:26:02.520]  listening Afghanistan Libya Syria Iraq all losing deadly ventures I believe I
[01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:09.520]  read it on on prison planet that you had a post up there that what according to
[01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:14.400]  these physicians for social responsibility some 2 million people have
[01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:21.720]  been killed in the last 10 years because United States and its coalition of the
[01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:26.800]  willing willingly slaughtering innocent people under the guise of bringing
[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:32.600]  freedom and democracy to these countries is that correct that's right you know we
[01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:37.040]  inflict mega death on people and what we wind up getting is mega debt to the
[01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:39.840]  military industrial complex and the bankers that pushes into this war isn't
[01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:47.680]  it Gerald well you nailed it again mega debt the United States cannot find
[01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:59.040]  five hundred million dollars worth of armaments and equipment that they left
[01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:05.760]  in Yemen I'm not making this up they just reported this about a month ago
[01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:13.200]  five hundred million dollars hey those roads got a lot of potholes on it you
[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:19.080]  the trains can't run on time we have money to send over to foreign nations and
[01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:26.720]  losing and one losing event after another again five hundred million
[01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:32.640]  dollars oh and by the way Saudi Arabia and ducking they were the biggest
[01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:38.560]  importer last year of defensive military equipment some six point five
[01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:42.400]  billion dollars worth yeah that's what it's about it's about feeding the
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:45.360]  military industrial complex isn't it Gerald you know there was a report that
[01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:51.040]  came out it was CNS news point out that one point two trillion dollars in taxes
[01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:54.720]  a record number of taxes just through February and yet that still didn't cover
[01:27:54.720 --> 01:28:00.080]  the bill we still had a 386 billion dollar deficit so we're not making the
[01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:04.720]  world freer we're making ourselves into debt slaves to the military industrial
[01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:09.520]  complex in the bankers yes you know what's going on now with them you know
[01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:14.240]  just today we are late last night it was announced that Australia signed on to
[01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:20.480]  the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank that's being headed by China they're
[01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:24.680]  gonna have a hundred billion dollars into it that's bigger than the World Bank
[01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:30.520]  and of course they weren't going to do it so the business of China hang on Gerald

[01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:33.680]  save them Yazidis on the mountain folks no we're not gonna go back there and
[01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:40.560]  run a strikes all the time in bomb syria we're just gonna save them Yazidis on
[01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:47.720]  the mountain and it's an anti-terrorist move and by the way he talks about his
[01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:55.360]  other great successes so let's listen to that we've targeted al-qaeda's affiliate
[01:33:55.360 --> 01:33:59.960]  in Yemen and recently eliminated the top commander of its affiliate in Somalia
[01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:04.720]  this counter-terrorism campaign will be waged through a steady relentless effort
[01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:09.800]  to take out ISIL wherever they exist using our airpower and our support for
[01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:14.760]  partners forces on the ground this strategy of taking out terrorists who
[01:34:14.760 --> 01:34:18.960]  threaten us while supporting partners on the front lines is one that we have
[01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:23.160]  successfully pursued in Yemen and Somalia for years and it is consistent
[01:34:23.160 --> 01:34:27.160]  with the approach I outlined earlier this year to use force against anyone
[01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:31.080]  who threatens America's core interests but to mobilize partners wherever
[01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:37.040]  possible to address broader challenges to international order oh there we go so
[01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:44.040]  yeah we're we're al-qaeda's partners in Syria many people said we were operating
[01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:48.840]  as al-qaeda's air force in Syria but of course we're now against al-qaeda in
[01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:52.680]  Yemen is what he's telling us right well what he's talking about in the
[01:34:52.680 --> 01:34:58.280]  victories that he's had in Yemen yeah great victory yeah great victory they
[01:34:58.280 --> 01:35:03.600]  pulled out all the troops they closed down the embassy and lost $500 million
[01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:09.880]  worth of arms there and here he is with all that arrogance bragging about the
[01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:16.760]  success we've had with our partners in Yemen our partner another general
[01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:24.200]  Hadi another dictator another you know military madman our partners and by the
[01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:29.320]  way they keep getting away with it and they keep doing it yeah I guess I'm
[01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:34.160]  gonna find now that when their partners go into Yemen their Saudi partners
[01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:36.880]  they're going to be fine finding that they're gonna be fighting people with
[01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:43.000]  the weapons that we left behind when we bugged out exactly and and again you
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:47.260]  know we'll cut it when we're taking a break before I was mentioning what's
[01:35:47.260 --> 01:35:53.080]  going on with China and the AAIB the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and
[01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:59.200]  that the if you look at America's policy in Asia what is it pivot to Asia more
[01:35:59.200 --> 01:36:07.520]  military reach and what's China's and the Asians policy more business when are
[01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:12.920]  we going to get out of this military mentality of war war and that's all
[01:36:12.920 --> 01:36:18.480]  we keep selling as our economy keeps going and you saw the numbers last week
[01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:26.240]  that came out on durable goods you saw the GDP numbers for 2014 oh whoopee do
[01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:31.840]  it came in about 2.2 percent after trillions of dollars pumped into the
[01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:36.320]  market through quantitative easing and record low interest rates and what are
[01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:42.280]  we doing getting involved in more wars and who can get away with this if I
[01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:48.440]  would if the president is there September 10th bragging bragging about
[01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:56.440]  our success in Yemen with our partner and puff the places up in smoke yeah
[01:36:56.440 --> 01:36:59.400]  yeah no sooner than he finished the speech essentially I guess it's kind of
[01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:02.560]  like his transparency that he was going to have a Gerald you know we're gonna
[01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:06.840]  know everything that his administration was doing and once coming after the
[01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:11.560]  freedom of the press more than all the other administrations combined yeah it's
[01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:13.920]  going to be interesting to see how this this breaks down and one of the things
[01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:18.680]  that you said when you're talking about this six years ago the very very likely
[01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:22.920]  that there's going to be terrorism in Saudi Arabia point out there's a large
[01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:28.000]  Yemeni population already in place in Saudi Arabia this could blow back in
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:34.120]  terms of the the Yemenis going on the offensive and that could have massive
[01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:39.120]  repercussions for oil and for the economy worldwide because the economy is
[01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:44.480]  essentially based on oil as a price of oil goes up economic activity plummets
[01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:49.040]  doesn't it yes and that's what you're going to start to see they're not gonna
[01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:53.640]  sit back and take this who would and if they have somebody else is attacking us
[01:37:53.640 --> 01:37:59.040]  we go back and attack them I mean can't people get this in their head and all
[01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:05.000]  this Arab little league has done is cause destabilization throughout the area
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:12.480]  I'll never forget David I was on China today and along with the Washington
[01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:18.960]  bureau chief of Al Jazeera now Al Jazeera is owned by the Qatar government
[01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:26.160]  and they're the Sunnis right so this guy is making the case for why the United
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:33.080]  States has to overthrow Qaddafi and this is going on for an hour and I finally I
[01:38:33.080 --> 01:38:37.040]  said to him listen I said I'm tired of hearing this I said here you are someone
[01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:42.480]  from Qatar saying that the Americans have to get involved in this Libyan war I
[01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:47.040]  said why don't you pack up your gear and take your wife and your kids and
[01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:51.880]  yourself and go lead the charge well there's this guy talking with this
[01:38:51.880 --> 01:38:56.880]  perfect English accent I guess the bureau chief was trained in the UK and
[01:38:56.880 --> 01:39:02.520]  then his cat lost it at the end he starts yelling and screaming look what
[01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:10.000]  our Nobel Peace Prize winner piece of garbage has done with Libya along with
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:16.200]  Samantha Powers Susan Rice and Hillary Clinton in overthrowing the Qaddafi
[01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:22.440]  government and what happened last week at the what happened in Tunisia with
[01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:29.960]  these Islamic fundamentalists who the United States and the Arab little league
[01:39:29.960 --> 01:39:35.720]  supported in overthrowing Qaddafi as they blew up this museum they were not
[01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:40.680]  blew up the museum they blew up people in this museum in Tunisia where do they
[01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:47.400]  come from they came from Libya where are they going into into Syria into Iraq
[01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:54.440]  it's all from the destabilization being caused by the Arab League and the United
[01:39:54.440 --> 01:40:00.920]  States support of these mass murderers going into foreign countries and trying
[01:40:00.920 --> 01:40:05.560]  to overthrow the governments yeah the course of the net result of our policies
[01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:09.680]  and Libya's basically to turn it into an arms market for terrorism a way that we
[01:40:09.680 --> 01:40:15.720]  can supply covertly our terrorist allies in Syria and other places maybe that was
[01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:19.400]  the design from the beginning what do you think Gerald but but I want to talk
[01:40:19.400 --> 01:40:25.360]  about the budget you know we have this massive defense budget we just had
[01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:31.200]  Rand Paul make a very controversial proposal he proposed adding a hundred
[01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:35.680]  and ninety billion dollars to the defense budget and here's one of the
[01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:41.200]  perhaps only voices that could stand up to say enough is enough on the defense
[01:40:41.200 --> 01:40:45.600]  bill but he doesn't do it and he actually is even more responsible though
[01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:48.400]  than the rest of the guys who are going to be throwing their head in the ring
[01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:52.440]  for president you got Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz signing on to that but not
[01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:55.600]  offsetting it with any cost at least you could say Rand Paul is trying to
[01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:59.200]  offset the hundred ninety billion dollar increase trying to offset it with a
[01:40:59.200 --> 01:41:03.160]  hundred and six billion dollar cuts in foreign aid other things like that but
[01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:07.960]  I guess the question is will it never end do we have anybody that is going to
[01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:13.400]  push back and say how big is enough and once we get to the size that the defense
[01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:17.080]  budget is as we were just talking about earlier in the show I think it's a real
[01:41:17.080 --> 01:41:21.360]  threat to the safety of Americans and of course it's a threat to our
[01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:26.440]  prosperity we cannot afford to have this kind of defense spending of course we
[01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:31.800]  can't it's it's destroying the country again you know Eisenhower warned us
[01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:37.400]  about it and I am sick of these guys throwing out we're going to protect the
[01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:43.920]  homeland pack up your stuff and go lead the charge send your kids as Obama's
[01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:47.040]  girls when they get out of college or before they get into college are they
[01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:51.880]  gonna join the service how many these senators sons and daughters are fighting
[01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:57.480]  everybody that wants war go to the foreign country where you're leading
[01:41:57.480 --> 01:42:04.240]  where you're where you're bringing war to and lead the charge I've had it with
[01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:11.800]  these little boy chicken hawks with big mouths and cojones the size of moth balls
[01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:18.960]  telling us where we have to go fight I'm sick of it and they are all traitors to
[01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:24.800]  the founding fathers of this nation from Washington to Jefferson to Madison to
[01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:31.080]  Franklin to Adams no foreign entanglements and what do they have to
[01:42:31.080 --> 01:42:38.040]  show for it nothing but loss if anybody could add up some successes I'd be
[01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:43.720]  happy to look at them in the meantime our nation's going down the crapper look
[01:42:43.720 --> 01:42:48.880]  at the numbers yeah see it's pretty amazing when you look at when you look
[01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:53.120]  at this increase Gerald this is more than most nations of the world have in a
[01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:57.080]  total defense budget way more than most of them have this way more than probably
[01:42:57.080 --> 01:43:02.080]  about 40% of the countries have its terms of a gross domestic product this
[01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:06.840]  $190 billion increase it's absolutely insane as you pointed out the founders
[01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:10.280]  knew this is going to destroy the country James Madison said he said if
[01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:12.960]  tyranny and oppression ever comes to this land it'll be in the guise of
[01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:16.760]  fighting a foreign enemy that's the way it's coming and it's bankrupting this
[01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:21.320]  country it's in front of us I'm disgusted with all these guys how can it
[01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:28.680]  change look David if you had a new member a new guy that was running the
[01:43:28.680 --> 01:43:34.960]  Bloods or the Crips is it going to change how the Bloods and the Crips operate
[01:43:34.960 --> 01:43:40.320]  and I don't say that sarcastically the Republicans and the Democrats are
[01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:45.760]  murderers and thieves how many more people that they have to murder around
[01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:51.160]  the world in the name of freedom and democracy and how much more of our money
[01:43:51.160 --> 01:43:56.480]  they have to steal in the name of the bailouts too big to fails loan
[01:43:56.480 --> 01:44:02.320]  guarantees and special tax breaks to our buddies we're not going to get it from
[01:44:02.320 --> 01:44:06.920]  the Bloods and the Crips or as people like to be more proper calling them the
[01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:12.560]  Republicans and the Democrats they're disgusting group of losers and thieves
[01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:16.760]  what you pointed out Gerald with the Asian Bank you said China is getting
[01:44:16.760 --> 01:44:20.720]  involved in business and all we're doing is you're shipping arms around our
[01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:26.080]  business now as a country it is arms shipment we are the arms merchant of
[01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:31.840]  the world and we're fleecing the American public we're destroying our wealth as
[01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:35.560]  well as we're going to be destroying our own individual freedom just as we see
[01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:41.480]  with this operation Jade Helm they are training I believe not just with this
[01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:45.200]  drill but of course I think these these wars that we're seeing in the Middle East
[01:44:45.200 --> 01:44:48.480]  I think those are training for what they're going to do here at home
[01:44:48.480 --> 01:44:54.040]  eventually I agree you're gonna see this is this gonna collapse everybody knows
[01:44:54.040 --> 01:44:57.880]  it's being held up by record low interest rates they haven't raised
[01:44:57.880 --> 01:45:04.000]  interest rates since 2006 we've had zero percent interest rates of six years now
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:07.720]  they're doing it over in Europe as well you know why the markets are up today
[01:45:07.720 --> 01:45:13.040]  China's announcing maybe they're gonna start pushing more dough into the system
[01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:17.520]  because they're real estate bubbles collapse at some point this Ponzi scheme
[01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:22.080]  is gonna fall apart and as I always say when people lose everything and have
[01:45:22.080 --> 01:45:26.120]  nothing left to lose they lose it and people have lost most everything they've
[01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:30.840]  lost their opportunity in this country and it's going to get a lot worse so
[01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:36.960]  what are they going to do they're gonna clamp down on us we the people it's it's
[01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:43.040]  a multi look it's fascism it's the merger state and corporate powers and and I'm
[01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:48.880]  not making that up when you see what happens with too big to fail it's the
[01:45:48.880 --> 01:45:53.560]  merger of state and corporate powers when you see bailouts and bailing out
[01:45:53.560 --> 01:45:58.800]  their friends in the business it's the merger of state and corporate powers it's
[01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:04.360]  in front of our eyes and what we see going on in Europe we see just about a
[01:46:04.360 --> 01:46:08.200]  month and a half ago we had Greenspan come out said yeah Greece is gonna leave
[01:46:08.200 --> 01:46:13.320]  the EU the only way we can keep the EU from coming apart is if we make it not
[01:46:13.320 --> 01:46:18.480]  just a trade agreement but if we make it a sovereign United States of Europe and
[01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:23.000]  that's what we had the largest bond seller Pemko said that over the just at
[01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:27.640]  the end of last week saying that we need a United States of Europe is the only
[01:46:27.640 --> 01:46:32.080]  way that the EU is going to survive so these trade agreements these austerity
[01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:36.880]  programs are putting on people this is all targeted towards pushing them to a
[01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:42.200]  political union not just an economic trade zone oh you got it and you know I
[01:46:42.200 --> 01:46:46.080]  mean nobody in this country barely other than your show mine you know the
[01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:50.760]  people that are concerned about this talk about the Trans Pacific partnership
[01:46:50.760 --> 01:46:55.680]  and the transatlantic agreement as well this has nothing to do very little to
[01:46:55.680 --> 01:46:59.840]  do with trade all it has to do with multinationals having the right so as
[01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:04.920]  sovereign nations and those are facts and we the people in this land of free
[01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:11.280]  dumb and democracy are not allowed to read it we can't see it because the
[01:47:11.280 --> 01:47:15.680]  multinationals are putting the deal together so we can't read it how's that
[01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:20.440]  the transparency yeah yeah that's exactly and of course now they're taking the
[01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:23.960]  mask off they're showing us and talking about it we've had Petraeus say you
[01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:27.040]  know what comes after America North America and he talks about the North
[01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:30.320]  American Union says we're 20 years into it they're taking the mask off they're
[01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:33.640]  showing people that the North American Union was all about a political
[01:47:33.640 --> 01:47:37.000]  consolidation all along and now they're taking the mask off and they're
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:41.160]  showing people that the European Union was all about a political consolidation
[01:47:41.160 --> 01:47:44.160]  all along as well and the way that they are going to push these political
[01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:48.960]  consolidations in is with economic hardship as we see starting to develop
[01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:54.600]  throughout the European Union exactly and by Petraeus what a disgusting human
[01:47:54.600 --> 01:47:59.840]  being he is and then look what happened with him he gets caught what giving
[01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:06.080]  classified information to his girlfriend and he gets a slap on the wrist yeah
[01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:11.640]  exactly there's a guy is the head of the CIA anybody else does it like Bradley
[01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:17.080]  Manning or anybody else you know they're in jail and doing hard time but hey when
[01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:21.580]  you're at the top again going back to fascism that's what happens in a
[01:48:21.580 --> 01:48:26.440]  fascist nation and I think Gerald it's it's important to point out that he
[01:48:26.440 --> 01:48:30.480]  wasn't you know Bradley Manning and these other people they were exposing
[01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:33.400]  information that was showing criminal wrongdoing Edward Snowden of showing
[01:48:33.400 --> 01:48:36.520]  criminal wrongdoing of our government and yet they come after the whistleblower
[01:48:36.520 --> 01:48:41.400]  they don't do anything about the people who were exposed committing criminal acts
[01:48:41.400 --> 01:48:45.800]  and yet Petraeus's was not a whistleblowing action when he released that
[01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:49.760]  information so he gets a pass it's only the people who are exposing criminal
[01:48:49.760 --> 01:48:54.920]  actions in this corrupt government that they come after yeah and again when
[01:48:54.920 --> 01:48:59.440]  you're talking about the North American Alliance and NAFTA of course begun on the
[01:48:59.440 --> 01:49:04.040]  Bill Clinton it's a multinational takeover and it's just going to keep
[01:49:04.040 --> 01:49:08.120]  going more and more in that direction you know when you think about the Asian

[01:53:02.640 --> 01:53:06.240]  Gerald Salente publisher of Trends Journal we've been talking about the
[01:53:06.240 --> 01:53:12.240]  problems inherent in our involvement in Yemen and of course are tied to the hip
[01:53:12.240 --> 01:53:15.760]  involvement with the Saudis who have now invaded Yemen we're going to talk to
[01:53:15.760 --> 01:53:19.440]  Gerald in this last segment about solutions before we do I want to remind
[01:53:19.440 --> 01:53:24.560]  you that we've got DNA force 30% off for just another couple of days it ends at
[01:53:24.560 --> 01:53:28.880]  the end of March at infowarslife.com you can get it for the first time under
[01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:34.760]  $100 why is it such a high-priced nutraceutical well because it's got
[01:53:34.760 --> 01:53:40.720]  very high quality rare ingredients like biopqq backed by over 175 published
[01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:45.000]  clinical studies as well as other things that help your mitochondrial health
[01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:50.520]  like Reservatrol the active healthy ingredient in red wine and of course the
[01:53:50.520 --> 01:53:55.360]  way that it does this is protecting your DNA many scientists have talked about
[01:53:55.360 --> 01:53:59.840]  how telomeres are the little in caps on the end of your DNA strings kind of like
[01:53:59.840 --> 01:54:04.200]  the caps on the end of your shoestrings when those disappear or get very short
[01:54:04.200 --> 01:54:09.520]  your DNA starts to essentially unravel starts to come apart the way that you
[01:54:09.520 --> 01:54:15.240]  keep that from happening is by having healthy mitochondrial cells and one of
[01:54:15.240 --> 01:54:19.080]  the ways that you do that is to fight the toxins give the nutrients to those
[01:54:19.080 --> 01:54:24.040]  cells that allow them to protect the DNA that the telomeres to get longer to
[01:54:24.040 --> 01:54:27.800]  protect that DNA strand to keep it from unraveling like a shoestring without a
[01:54:27.800 --> 01:54:33.880]  tip so you can find that right now 30% off DNA force at infowarslife.com
[01:54:33.880 --> 01:54:38.640]  Gerald tell us about solutions what can we do about this when you talk about how
[01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:42.640]  bad the military industrial complexes the government that just continues to
[01:54:42.640 --> 01:54:46.960]  grow unchecked even the most the people who are portraying themselves as
[01:54:46.960 --> 01:54:51.480]  fiscally conservative they want to grow up by 190 billion dollars what what is a
[01:54:51.480 --> 01:54:56.440]  solution to all of this well I think it's honoring my founding fathers and
[01:54:56.440 --> 01:55:00.160]  going back to what this country was based upon and I know the people say
[01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:04.000]  there were a lot of terrible things I know none of us are perfect this was the
[01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:09.040]  land of opportunity and it was the and the envy of the world for a lot of the
[01:55:09.040 --> 01:55:15.600]  great things that happened here so in the basis of that no foreign entanglements
[01:55:15.600 --> 01:55:22.120]  close all the bases overseas seal the borders we got enough three hundred and
[01:55:22.120 --> 01:55:28.160]  sixteen million people high unemployment rates low income because of all the
[01:55:28.160 --> 01:55:34.400]  cheap labor coming in I've been writing about this since 1985 you know the
[01:55:34.400 --> 01:55:38.560]  numbers are all there the more cheap labor that comes in the low of the
[01:55:38.560 --> 01:55:43.520]  standard of living and these trade agreements that are not trade agreements
[01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:49.160]  at all they're available so that the multi-nationals could exploit slave
[01:55:49.160 --> 01:55:55.720]  labor overseas and bring the product over here and sell it to us so number one
[01:55:55.720 --> 01:56:00.720]  bring the troops home no foreign entanglements use these troops to seal
[01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:07.200]  the border take that money that's being wasted and blowing up the world and
[01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:14.720]  rebuild America look at our infrastructure it's a joke you go to you
[01:56:14.720 --> 01:56:22.240]  go to Asia you go to Europe and you come back when I fly back into JFK oh my god
[01:56:22.240 --> 01:56:27.960]  I can't believe it what a disgrace you know that going down the parkway litter
[01:56:27.960 --> 01:56:36.040]  everywhere a beat-up terminal so let's rebuild America number two put the laws
[01:56:36.040 --> 01:56:42.640]  back in place that leveled the playing field it was what happened during the
[01:56:42.640 --> 01:56:47.800]  19th of the 20th century people like Teddy Roosevelt knew that the robber
[01:56:47.800 --> 01:56:53.680]  barons if they had their hands on all the dough would rob it from everybody else
[01:56:53.680 --> 01:56:57.720]  so they put in place their opposite Patman acts German anti-trust act
[01:56:57.720 --> 01:57:03.440]  Clayton anti-trust act that leveled the playing field young people have no
[01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:09.400]  idea what it used to be like they think it was always a Walmart or a target they
[01:57:09.400 --> 01:57:15.800]  think that there was always a CVS and a ride aid or a staples in a home depot or
[01:57:15.800 --> 01:57:22.680]  a Lowe's and a and and and somebody else that does all the business and put out

[01:58:53.720 --> 01:59:01.520]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:59:01.520 --> 01:59:09.040]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:59:09.040 --> 01:59:15.440]  Alex Jones welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and we've been
[01:59:15.440 --> 01:59:19.160]  talking to Gerald Slenty and we got to the top five hour and had to take a
[01:59:19.160 --> 01:59:23.760]  break but Gerald has graciously consented to continue because we wanted to
[01:59:23.760 --> 01:59:28.640]  hear what his solutions were he was on a roll talking about the way we roll this
[01:59:28.640 --> 01:59:32.960]  back we spent most of the hour talking about the problems we need to hear about
[01:59:32.960 --> 01:59:37.160]  the solutions go ahead Gerald I want to pick up from where you left off yes and
[01:59:37.160 --> 01:59:41.640]  putting these laws back in place so that we all have a shot at it and the
[01:59:41.640 --> 01:59:45.760]  multinationals don't own everything you look at the stock market today the
[01:59:45.760 --> 01:59:49.880]  rise you know why it's going up because all the merger and acquisition activity
[01:59:49.880 --> 01:59:56.360]  going on that's right that's all this has become 50% of all the stock rise since
[01:59:56.360 --> 02:00:01.720]  they started quantitative easing back in 2009 has come from companies buying back
[02:00:01.720 --> 02:00:08.480]  their stock and M&A activity that is now beyond 2007 levels so the third part of
[02:00:08.480 --> 02:00:16.040]  it is a self-sustaining economy we are one of the richest nations in the world
[02:00:16.040 --> 02:00:22.400]  with our mind and our natural resources you think we could make our own shoes
[02:00:22.400 --> 02:00:31.480]  our own shirts our own slacks no what we have to do is we have to offshore it so
[02:00:31.480 --> 02:00:38.160]  the multinationals could export the labor to slave labor markets and bring it
[02:00:38.160 --> 02:00:44.880]  back we need to be a self-sustaining economy everything is in place except
[02:00:44.880 --> 02:00:52.920]  one thing and that is we're being run and ruled by a bunch of low-life politicians
[02:00:52.920 --> 02:01:00.200]  how could any self-respecting person look up to a little Lindsay Graham a John
[02:01:00.200 --> 02:01:09.000]  insane McCain or out of a mind Pelosi glad you're going read and a slimy Chuck
[02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:17.240]  Schumer name them line them up little Machio Rubio Teddy Cruz and now we just
[02:01:17.240 --> 02:01:23.640]  saw Rand Paul as you pointed out all of a sudden he was against increasing the
[02:01:23.640 --> 02:01:29.840]  defense budget and now he's increasing it he was against foreign aid and now he
[02:01:29.840 --> 02:01:35.160]  changed it oh we'll give it to Israel I don't want my money going anywhere other
[02:01:35.160 --> 02:01:40.160]  than the United States the solutions are there David but they don't want to do it
[02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:45.960]  because all the you know what they used to call bribes and payoffs they put a
[02:01:45.960 --> 02:01:51.480]  white shoe boy name on it they call it campaign contributions look at the dough
[02:01:51.480 --> 02:01:55.720]  that Hillary Clinton's gotten from foreign countries around the world look
[02:01:55.720 --> 02:02:02.320]  where the money's coming in from Jebi Bush it's a sellout absolutely yeah and
[02:02:02.320 --> 02:02:06.800]  it's not going to change because they've got so much power and so much money
[02:02:06.800 --> 02:02:11.240]  because they can just print the money that has become a massive black hole for
[02:02:11.240 --> 02:02:14.960]  corruption I mean this thing just keeps accelerating it's like we've we've past
[02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:19.360]  the event horizon and we're going in I don't I don't see how we stopped this
[02:02:19.360 --> 02:02:22.360]  kind of corruption this kind of power I think that's the problem there's just
[02:02:22.360 --> 02:02:25.760]  too much power in Washington I think we've got to cut it off at the state
[02:02:25.760 --> 02:02:30.000]  level what do you think Gerald absolutely and that's why again you know we
[02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:35.120]  need a new third party it's not it's not even a two-party system anymore it's a
[02:02:35.120 --> 02:02:42.560]  two-family system that's true I gotta see another Bush and Clinton my god how
[02:02:42.560 --> 02:02:48.280]  could this happen and where's the outrage where is the outrage where's the
[02:02:48.280 --> 02:02:54.160]  courage of the people where's the fighting back and I don't mean physical I
[02:02:54.160 --> 02:02:59.320]  mean I mean intellectual how could they let well how could we let this happen so
[02:02:59.320 --> 02:03:05.680]  having said all that I think 2016 is the perfect year for really something
[02:03:05.680 --> 02:03:10.720]  positive to happen and I really believe this is the time for a third party more

[02:07:17.200 --> 02:07:24.400]  taking your phone calls at 800-259-9231 I want to go back and talk before we go
[02:07:24.400 --> 02:07:28.640]  to the calls about this situation North Carolina where they were debating
[02:07:28.640 --> 02:07:34.360]  medical marijuana because it concerns me so much to see Christians shut off
[02:07:34.360 --> 02:07:39.240]  their compassion for people talking about how this has helped them or their
[02:07:39.240 --> 02:07:44.080]  loved ones I talked about that in the last hour what I did not read to you
[02:07:44.080 --> 02:07:50.240]  from is his justification for what he's doing and he appeals to William Bennett of
[02:07:50.240 --> 02:07:56.240]  all people the man who first used the term czar to describe his office that
[02:07:56.240 --> 02:08:03.040]  was given to him I think by others but he proudly wore that title and as I talk
[02:08:03.040 --> 02:08:07.960]  about marijuana medical marijuana being a gateway to harder drugs I've got to
[02:08:07.960 --> 02:08:12.480]  say that the war on drugs if you haven't figured it out by now over the last 40
[02:08:12.480 --> 02:08:17.880]  years has been a gateway to corruption it's been a gateway to a police state
[02:08:17.880 --> 02:08:23.160]  it's been a gateway to the loss of private property rights it's been a
[02:08:23.160 --> 02:08:28.080]  gateway to having the largest percentage of people in prison of any country in
[02:08:28.080 --> 02:08:32.880]  history in America that's the kind of country that we're creating because we
[02:08:32.880 --> 02:08:39.000]  don't have compassion or because we think that the government can get our
[02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:44.120]  children off of drugs that we can't as a family that we can't as a church that
[02:08:44.120 --> 02:08:50.560]  Christ has no power to change lives only the iron fist of government that's not
[02:08:50.560 --> 02:08:56.240]  being salt and light that is just being a gun in somebody's face you know I'm
[02:08:56.240 --> 02:08:59.960]  reminded of the story and there's been several these stories actually I'm
[02:08:59.960 --> 02:09:06.480]  afraid one in particular a mayoral a Maryland mother she could not stop her
[02:09:06.480 --> 02:09:09.960]  son from using drugs is very concerned about so she turned her son in had him
[02:09:09.960 --> 02:09:17.120]  put in prison while he was in prison he died from an overdose of drugs and
[02:09:17.120 --> 02:09:22.080]  there are federal prisoners who dying of who are dying of overdoses of drugs in
[02:09:22.080 --> 02:09:26.000]  prison all the time and let me ask you this if you can get enough drugs to
[02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:31.280]  overdose on them in prison then how are you ever going to stop it on the outside
[02:09:31.280 --> 02:09:36.400]  are we going to live in a panoptagon prison well that appears to be what
[02:09:36.400 --> 02:09:41.480]  they're happy to have us live in and look at this story about corruption just
[02:09:41.480 --> 02:09:47.600]  the latest example a drug cartel funded DEA agent sex parties this is on USA
[02:09:47.600 --> 02:09:51.640]  today it was linked drudge headed up last week and of course this is yet
[02:09:51.640 --> 02:09:58.800]  another example of a bunch of DEA agents who are having sex parties that
[02:09:58.800 --> 02:10:03.200]  the drug guys that they're supposed to be shutting down are providing for them
[02:10:03.200 --> 02:10:06.960]  that's where we're headed with this that's where this goes but this is what
[02:10:06.960 --> 02:10:11.080]  William Bennett said in his book and this is what Reverend Creech with the
[02:10:11.080 --> 02:10:15.280]  Christian Action League of North Carolina quoted he said medicine like
[02:10:15.280 --> 02:10:20.320]  disease is serious business its recognition its use its deployment its
[02:10:20.320 --> 02:10:24.440]  method of delivery should not be determined by popular demand no we
[02:10:24.440 --> 02:10:29.960]  should not have that freedom to do that we should have the men or should say the
[02:10:29.960 --> 02:10:34.760]  corporations and white lab coats telling us about that we do that with no
[02:10:34.760 --> 02:10:38.200]  other medical treatment not even over-the-counter non-prescription drugs
[02:10:38.200 --> 02:10:41.960]  you see they just go through it's the men at the pharmaceutical companies they
[02:10:41.960 --> 02:10:46.160]  tell us what is safe and what is it through the AMA and through the FDA
[02:10:46.160 --> 02:10:51.960]  that they control when you say that we do not have a right to take medicine you
[02:10:51.960 --> 02:10:58.120]  also are saying that we do not have a right to refuse medicine that's part
[02:10:58.120 --> 02:11:02.520]  of the debate that we're having right now in terms of vaccines it's interesting
[02:11:02.520 --> 02:11:06.800]  I think that this is about this is the 10-year anniversary of Terry Shavo's
[02:11:06.800 --> 02:11:11.200]  death happened just within the last couple of days it's an article up on
[02:11:11.200 --> 02:11:17.680]  WorldNet Daily and I gotta say that one of the things about Terry Shavo's death
[02:11:17.680 --> 02:11:25.760]  that really bothered me at the time was the death of compassion the idea that a
[02:11:25.760 --> 02:11:31.280]  probate court judge could withhold food and water from somebody who's dying
[02:11:31.280 --> 02:11:36.480]  against the wishes of some in her family it was a fight within the family but I
[02:11:36.480 --> 02:11:42.160]  cannot understand any situation where you would withhold food and water from a
[02:11:42.160 --> 02:11:46.480]  suffering person and of course the Bush brothers had their fingers all over this
[02:11:46.480 --> 02:11:49.240]  situation either one of them could have shut it down
[02:11:49.240 --> 02:11:53.520]  Jeb was governor of Florida he could have shut down the order of this probate
[02:11:53.520 --> 02:11:57.720]  judge instead they were arresting some Christians who actually were acting
[02:11:57.720 --> 02:12:01.640]  like Christians they actually tried to give her a cup of cold water and they
[02:12:01.640 --> 02:12:05.640]  were arrested for that you know Jesus said many people I'll talk to in the
[02:12:05.640 --> 02:12:08.840]  last day and say I was hungry and you gave me no food I was thirsty you gave
[02:12:08.840 --> 02:12:16.200]  me no water you didn't visit me in prison now instead we empowered the
[02:12:16.200 --> 02:12:20.440]  government to withhold food and water we empowered the government to throw you
[02:12:20.440 --> 02:12:26.920]  in prison because what we do the least of them we do to Christ that's the
[02:12:26.920 --> 02:12:32.840]  problem the problem is a death of compassion and I think something that
[02:12:32.840 --> 02:12:37.600]  really illustrates that is this story that came out in the last few days it's
[02:12:37.600 --> 02:12:46.200]  a book that is talking about abortion to children it's called sister apples
[02:12:46.200 --> 02:12:50.040]  sister pig the story follows Lee and they say we're not going to say whether
[02:12:50.040 --> 02:12:54.440]  that's a boy or a girl Lee searching for his or her sister who might be an apple
[02:12:54.440 --> 02:12:59.160]  who might be a pig or who might be somewhere in the tree because see Lee
[02:12:59.160 --> 02:13:04.240]  is Papa and Mama's only child for now although there was once a sister where
[02:13:04.240 --> 02:13:09.640]  does sister live well she used to live in Mama she doesn't live there anymore
[02:13:09.640 --> 02:13:13.480]  she used to live before me he says but Mama couldn't keep her Mama says she's
[02:13:13.480 --> 02:13:20.720]  now a ghost Lee's Papa says does that make you sad or scared well I'm sad that
[02:13:20.720 --> 02:13:24.640]  my sister's a ghost if you had kept my sister though you would be tired you
[02:13:24.640 --> 02:13:30.720]  would be sad you might be mad because we would be wild and loud and sometimes we
[02:13:30.720 --> 02:13:34.880]  would fight and Mama might be scared that she could not buy enough food for
[02:13:34.880 --> 02:13:40.720]  us Mama might not have enough time to read to me to paint with me to play with
[02:13:40.720 --> 02:13:45.480]  me to talk with me and then I guess presumably he sits there and he thinks
[02:13:45.480 --> 02:13:48.880]  well you know actually I'd have more time with Mama if Papa wasn't around
[02:13:48.880 --> 02:13:54.480]  cue the psycho music this is where it's going to wind up though it's not just
[02:13:54.480 --> 02:13:59.200]  it's abortion it's euthanasia it's killing people because we think it serves
[02:13:59.200 --> 02:14:04.640]  our better good it's because it's an economic advantage to it or because it's
[02:14:04.640 --> 02:14:10.680]  in society's best interests the way you stop that is by saying we're not going
[02:14:10.680 --> 02:14:15.640]  to dictate whether you can take medicine or not we're not going to force
[02:14:15.640 --> 02:14:22.320]  vaccines on you we're going to respect life they fully well know that this
[02:14:22.320 --> 02:14:26.640]  baby was alive this isn't being put out now by the abortion people and saying
[02:14:26.640 --> 02:14:30.840]  that well we have a difference of opinion now as to when life begins it's
[02:14:30.840 --> 02:14:35.360]  like no I know the child's alive and it's it's for the best it's for my best
[02:14:35.360 --> 02:14:38.960]  it's for the family's best I'm just going to kill this child you don't have
[02:14:38.960 --> 02:14:43.160]  that authority you should never have that kind of authority the God that gave
[02:14:43.160 --> 02:14:46.280]  us life gave us liberty at the same time you're not going to have life or
[02:14:46.280 --> 02:14:51.320]  liberty if you destroy one or the other they're inextricably tied together
[02:14:51.320 --> 02:14:56.600]  that's why I am so adamant that we need to stop the war on drugs it is
[02:14:56.600 --> 02:15:00.960]  destroying everything in the fabric of our society about the rule of law it's
[02:15:00.960 --> 02:15:05.680]  destroying all of our rights but it's also going we had this article that was
[02:15:05.680 --> 02:15:12.480]  March 27th on infowars.com Matthew Iglesias saying watching my wife give
[02:15:12.480 --> 02:15:17.760]  birth made me more pro-abortion apparently the Vox executive editor
[02:15:17.760 --> 02:15:22.680]  Matthew Iglesias is unaware that his newborn son will one day read and so
[02:15:22.680 --> 02:15:28.640]  he's talking about yeah I can it makes me support abortion to watch my wife give
[02:15:28.640 --> 02:15:35.200]  birth isn't that sad but see that's where we are and I think we really the
[02:15:35.200 --> 02:15:39.240]  reason I came down on this Christian action league that began they proudly
[02:15:39.240 --> 02:15:45.960]  point out that they began by being the anti saloon league by starting alcohol
[02:15:45.960 --> 02:15:49.800]  prohibition and we look at them death and the suffering and the misery that
[02:15:49.800 --> 02:15:53.520]  came from alcohol prohibition and that is nothing compared to what they've
[02:15:53.520 --> 02:15:59.680]  inflicted on us with the much broader prohibition that we have now people who
[02:15:59.680 --> 02:16:04.320]  say that they are well-meaning need to understand what George Washington said
[02:16:04.320 --> 02:16:08.280]  when he said that government is not compassion it's not eloquence it's not
[02:16:08.280 --> 02:16:15.880]  reason it is force it is force you are forcing people because you don't think
[02:16:15.880 --> 02:16:22.600]  Christian that Jesus has the power to change lives and at the same time on the
[02:16:22.600 --> 02:16:28.320]  same page the other article from the Christian action league pointed out that
[02:16:28.320 --> 02:16:33.720]  they were having their church buildings taxed by some aggressive localities who
[02:16:33.720 --> 02:16:37.240]  said well while this church building is under construction it's not being used
[02:16:37.240 --> 02:16:43.440]  for religious purposes therefore we can tax it as property now that's abusive but
[02:16:43.440 --> 02:16:49.160]  I think what it does is it sends a message to them that those who live by
[02:16:49.160 --> 02:16:53.960]  the government will die by the government whether it's just taxing at
[02:16:53.960 --> 02:16:59.200]  your building I think they need to be more compassionate and more concerned
[02:16:59.200 --> 02:17:03.280]  about the sick people than they are about getting tax exemptions for their
[02:17:03.280 --> 02:17:08.720]  church buildings that's fundamentally the problem with Christianity right now
[02:17:08.720 --> 02:17:13.720]  in America you know it was said that when Christianity went to the Roman Empire
[02:17:13.720 --> 02:17:17.200]  became a government when it went to Europe it became a culture when it came
[02:17:17.200 --> 02:17:23.040]  to America it became a business there are a lot of different ways that you can
[02:17:23.040 --> 02:17:26.200]  make money out of Christianity one of them is setting up a Christian action
[02:17:26.200 --> 02:17:34.000]  league using it to create political situations to get people scared about
[02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:39.320]  marijuana to withhold marijuana from people who are suffering even to
[02:17:39.320 --> 02:17:44.400]  withhold it from let's say making products that would compete with a big

[02:17:53.440 --> 02:17:57.520]  can't find it but it's in one of the states that say a legislative alert
[02:17:57.520 --> 02:18:01.520]  from the 10th Amendment Center that there is another bill before state
[02:18:01.520 --> 02:18:07.160]  legislature to make hemp legal and of course hemp cannot get anyone high it
[02:18:07.160 --> 02:18:11.960]  is not a gateway to anything it was used to make rope during World War two you

[02:23:46.800 --> 02:23:53.480]  stock at info wars life.com new supermail vitality let's go to Brandon and
[02:23:53.480 --> 02:23:55.840]  Georgia Brandon
[02:23:55.840 --> 02:24:03.280]  hello hey David I wanted to ask you about the 2016 election if you think that
[02:24:03.280 --> 02:24:10.080]  the left would try to stage any type of false flags this way I guess the outcome
[02:24:10.080 --> 02:24:15.960]  of the election well there's always a possibility that the people will the
[02:24:15.960 --> 02:24:21.160]  government left and right will stage false flag operations to further their
[02:24:21.160 --> 02:24:24.400]  agenda and that's something we're constantly concerned about I mean
[02:24:24.400 --> 02:24:30.000]  certainly you know we saw the Bush administration not a left-wing organization
[02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:34.760]  at all but they they put out false flags to further their agenda so yeah that's
[02:24:34.760 --> 02:24:38.400]  always a possibility they've got a lot of agendas that could be furthered by
[02:24:38.400 --> 02:24:43.640]  that I think in terms of presidential election I think we really need to focus
[02:24:43.640 --> 02:24:47.320]  more at the state level because as I point out at the beginning of this
[02:24:47.320 --> 02:24:49.960]  program I think that's really where we're seeing the fight being taken to
[02:24:49.960 --> 02:24:52.760]  this we don't see any presidential candidates with the exception of Rand
[02:24:52.760 --> 02:24:57.640]  Paul even talking about civil asset forfeiture for the most part it's not
[02:24:57.640 --> 02:25:02.640]  even a topic in Washington but we've seen now two state legislatures and we're
[02:25:02.640 --> 02:25:07.440]  waiting to see one Republican governor vetoed that but we've got another state
[02:25:07.440 --> 02:25:12.040]  legislature in New Mexico it was a Wyoming legislature that rolled back
[02:25:12.040 --> 02:25:15.520]  civil asset forfeiture in other words taking people's property without ever
[02:25:15.520 --> 02:25:19.120]  charging them with a crime let alone convicting them of a crime they said
[02:25:19.120 --> 02:25:22.880]  you're not going to do that we're going to go back to the rule of law not have
[02:25:22.880 --> 02:25:28.440]  our police operate as a bunch of highway robbers quite literally highway robbers
[02:25:28.440 --> 02:25:33.680]  just confiscating your property for any kind of excuse and with no proportion
[02:25:33.680 --> 02:25:38.040]  whatsoever to the crime so that's another part of it not just innocent till
[02:25:38.040 --> 02:25:42.040]  proven guilty I can't penalize somebody until you convict them but also the
[02:25:42.040 --> 02:25:47.800]  penalty is just so far out of any proportionality to the crime so we've
[02:25:47.800 --> 02:25:52.040]  seen that in Wyoming we've seen it now in New Mexico state legislatures
[02:25:52.040 --> 02:25:56.960]  repudiating that now the Wyoming governor has vetoed that there's still
[02:25:56.960 --> 02:26:01.440]  possibility they may override that veto but I think that's really where we need
[02:26:01.440 --> 02:26:05.120]  to focus we need to see what's going to happen in New Mexico and there's many
[02:26:05.120 --> 02:26:09.200]  other areas the fight is on with informed consent they're doing that at the
[02:26:09.200 --> 02:26:12.960]  state level that's not something that's happening at the at the federal level I
[02:26:12.960 --> 02:26:17.200]  think that the federal level has become so corrupt so much power so much money
[02:26:17.200 --> 02:26:20.720]  in Washington that you can't really influence it anymore and I don't think
[02:26:20.720 --> 02:26:23.880]  sending a mr. Smith to Washington is really going to do it for us anymore I
[02:26:23.880 --> 02:26:28.720]  think we've got to start cutting off this black hole of power and corruption
[02:26:28.720 --> 02:26:33.440]  that we call Washington DC we need to nullify it at the state legislature level
[02:26:33.440 --> 02:26:37.760]  and we need to nullify it with fully informed juries because you can nullify
[02:26:37.760 --> 02:26:46.160]  bad state laws at that level as well what do you think Brandon I think I
[02:26:46.160 --> 02:26:51.120]  wouldn't really put it past the left in particular because they so desperately
[02:26:51.120 --> 02:26:54.840]  need to win I mean in the case of Hillary Hillary Clinton if you look at
[02:26:54.840 --> 02:26:59.120]  what happened under her husband's presidency you had Waco you had Ruby
[02:26:59.120 --> 02:27:03.440]  Ridge you had the Oklahoma City bombing and you also had him training troops
[02:27:03.440 --> 02:27:07.840]  domestically to take people's guns and kick their doors and the sort of
[02:27:07.840 --> 02:27:11.920]  conditioned people to get used to the idea of seeing our Marines on the street
[02:27:11.920 --> 02:27:16.600]  that like much like you would see a patrol officer on the street oh yeah oh
[02:27:16.600 --> 02:27:20.560]  yeah but it's very well loved on the right as well and it is a Gerald Solentia
[02:27:20.560 --> 02:27:25.120]  is pointing out you know we've really got one party and two families and I
[02:27:25.120 --> 02:27:27.680]  think it's going to be a Bush or a Clinton that's going to be running this
[02:27:27.680 --> 02:27:31.480]  time because that's where the money is is flowing in both of those cases I think
[02:27:31.480 --> 02:27:35.640]  there's it'd be great if we had somebody who would put forward a lot of
[02:27:35.640 --> 02:27:40.040]  libertarian ideas is as Rand Paul does I'm not happy with some of the things
[02:27:40.040 --> 02:27:44.360]  that I've seen from him but I'm very happy with a lot of the things that I've
[02:27:44.360 --> 02:27:48.080]  seen from him and he's the only person who is basically trying to roll back the
[02:27:48.080 --> 02:27:53.520]  state infringement on our rights as far as I can see but I think that our
[02:27:53.520 --> 02:27:58.480]  energy is best spent at trying to solve things at a closer level that's where
[02:27:58.480 --> 02:28:02.960]  we're going to have more leverage I think as opposed to getting so hung up on
[02:28:02.960 --> 02:28:07.000]  the presidential election I think for the most part that's going to be a head
[02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:11.200]  fake thank you Brandon let's go to well when we come back we're gonna go to Rob

[02:32:22.400 --> 02:32:28.160]  going back to your calls in just a moment 800-259-9231 gonna be going to
[02:32:28.160 --> 02:32:32.680]  rob in Arizona first before we do I just wanted to point out that Ebola is
[02:32:32.680 --> 02:32:36.760]  back in the news you may not have noticed it too much but it is there there
[02:32:36.760 --> 02:32:41.320]  is a massive quarantine in Sierra Leone where they have never gotten it under
[02:32:41.320 --> 02:32:46.520]  control remember back in September there was a one million person quarantine
[02:32:46.520 --> 02:32:50.360]  they say that this one is going to be similar except that it is two and a half
[02:32:50.360 --> 02:32:55.200]  million people they are quarantining in Sierra Leone now the other two countries
[02:32:55.200 --> 02:33:01.880]  that it was heavy in Ghana and Liberia they appear to have gotten it under
[02:33:01.880 --> 02:33:07.160]  control nevertheless you've got in Sierra Leone police firing tear gas on the
[02:33:07.160 --> 02:33:12.680]  crowds they point out this is a Reuters report that this is now 12,000 cases of
[02:33:12.680 --> 02:33:19.040]  Ebola and 3,000 deaths they say I think it's a higher casually rate than that
[02:33:19.040 --> 02:33:25.280]  that's their figures nevertheless the 10,000 total cases is up from the the
[02:33:25.280 --> 02:33:29.400]  12,000 is up from the 10,000 we saw recently and think about this of all
[02:33:29.400 --> 02:33:34.800]  the previous outbreaks of Ebola the very worst one prior to this had 400 cases
[02:33:34.800 --> 02:33:39.880]  so now we see 12,000 cases and it is still not under control they're firing
[02:33:39.880 --> 02:33:43.960]  tear gas on crowds to try to keep them locked down in Sierra Leone and of course
[02:33:43.960 --> 02:33:48.120]  Guinea is concerned they're deploying their police as they see the people from
[02:33:48.120 --> 02:33:53.960]  Sierra Leone trying to flee the lockdown in their country coming across the
[02:33:53.960 --> 02:33:57.840]  border so they're calling out the police and it turns out that actually it is now
[02:33:57.840 --> 02:34:02.080]  on the uptick in Guinea as well I said that they had it was under control in
[02:34:02.080 --> 02:34:06.320]  Liberia and Guinea nevertheless they do have a health emergency now they're
[02:34:06.320 --> 02:34:10.800]  saying in five regions of Guinea this is reported by the BBC news they're even
[02:34:10.800 --> 02:34:14.760]  quarantining hospitals I guess that gives all new meaning to the word
[02:34:14.760 --> 02:34:18.680]  Cronkenhaus you know that's a German word for hospital they say so reinforced
[02:34:18.680 --> 02:34:26.280]  health emergency for a period of 45 days in five regions of Guinea and of course
[02:34:26.280 --> 02:34:31.960]  we have a an American patient that is undergoing treatment for Ebola he was
[02:34:31.960 --> 02:34:40.840]  brought back one of actually 25 people that were evacuated out of out of Africa
[02:34:40.840 --> 02:34:44.360]  that had been exposed this one person came down with it was sick and they felt
[02:34:44.360 --> 02:34:50.160]  that there were 17 other staffers that came back to America they distributed
[02:34:50.160 --> 02:34:54.800]  them amongst the three centers that we have that can work with Ebola patients
[02:34:54.800 --> 02:35:00.080]  in the United States they sent another seven I think it was back to the UK to
[02:35:00.080 --> 02:35:03.760]  be observed nobody has shown any symptoms except for this one patient he
[02:35:03.760 --> 02:35:08.480]  went from serious to critical condition and that was reported about a week and
[02:35:08.480 --> 02:35:13.880]  a half ago now they're saying that he is back up to serious condition very sick
[02:35:13.880 --> 02:35:19.840]  far sicker than the nurses that came down with it in the case in Dallas and
[02:35:19.840 --> 02:35:25.040]  one last article here about Ebola they're saying that Liberia is urging
[02:35:25.040 --> 02:35:29.800]  Ebola survivors to stop having sex because it is sexually transmitted for
[02:35:29.800 --> 02:35:36.640]  quite some time after the person is healed so that is perhaps one of the
[02:35:36.640 --> 02:35:41.880]  reasons why this is so hard to keep under control but I tell you the thing
[02:35:41.880 --> 02:35:47.320]  that concerns me the most about this is not Ebola but it's the fact that they
[02:35:47.320 --> 02:35:52.080]  are doing vaccine trials I am very concerned with all the talk that's
[02:35:52.080 --> 02:35:57.240]  going on about mandating vaccines I'm very concerned about a mandated Ebola
[02:35:57.240 --> 02:36:01.080]  vaccine or something similar that could be brought to the United States and of
[02:36:01.080 --> 02:36:06.720]  course we have two companies GlaxoSmithKline and Merck they are they
[02:36:06.720 --> 02:36:11.960]  have tested in a Liberian trial they've tested to see if these drugs are safe
[02:36:11.960 --> 02:36:18.760]  and you know they did it for almost two months they looked to see and they said
[02:36:18.760 --> 02:36:24.160]  well we didn't see any signs after two months so it must be fine kind of like
[02:36:24.160 --> 02:36:30.480]  you know when they tested the effect of GMOs on rats you know after the French
[02:36:30.480 --> 02:36:34.440]  scientist did it for an extended period of time you saw the picture of the rats
[02:36:34.440 --> 02:36:40.480]  that have massive tumors all over their body and then Monsanto and other
[02:36:40.480 --> 02:36:43.360]  companies went in and said well we did a test we didn't see that happen because
[02:36:43.360 --> 02:36:47.040]  they cut their tests off after just a couple of weeks well that's what they've
[02:36:47.040 --> 02:36:50.640]  done with these Ebola vaccines they say well you know we we began these trials
[02:36:50.640 --> 02:36:55.560]  in early February and so now we're ready we we know that they're safe and so
[02:36:55.560 --> 02:36:59.240]  we're going to move on to the next trial to see if it can actually protect
[02:36:59.240 --> 02:37:03.920]  people from getting Ebola see they don't really have to worry about the safety of
[02:37:03.920 --> 02:37:08.520]  these vaccines because they've got the vaccine court that was created by Ronald
[02:37:08.520 --> 02:37:14.640]  Reagan in 1986 because so many people were getting so seriously damaged by
[02:37:14.640 --> 02:37:18.720]  vaccines that people were stopping taking their vaccines so I said oh we'll
[02:37:18.720 --> 02:37:24.560]  solve this we will give the vaccine companies legal immunity you may not
[02:37:24.560 --> 02:37:27.720]  get immunity for what they're vaccinating you for but they will give
[02:37:27.720 --> 02:37:31.560]  them legal immunity so that you cannot sue them for damages that's why they
[02:37:31.560 --> 02:37:35.440]  have the vaccine court so when they start talking about mandatory vaccine you
[02:37:35.440 --> 02:37:40.280]  ask them why won't you accept responsibility for your product if it's
[02:37:40.280 --> 02:37:44.280]  safe and effective why do you have to have something that no other product or
[02:37:44.280 --> 02:37:48.640]  medicine anywhere in this country has and that is its own special court to
[02:37:48.640 --> 02:37:53.680]  shut down the people who are damaged by this now they say that they're going to
[02:37:53.680 --> 02:37:58.840]  begin testing them for efficacy against Ebola so they're going to move these
[02:37:58.840 --> 02:38:04.480]  trials perhaps to Sierra Leone that's really sad but I do not want to see this
[02:38:04.480 --> 02:38:09.480]  coming to America and of course they're talking about active immunity with a
[02:38:09.480 --> 02:38:12.960]  vaccine they're not talking about passive immunity what you had when they
[02:38:12.960 --> 02:38:17.880]  transferred blood plasma transferred antibodies to people who had survived the
[02:38:17.880 --> 02:38:22.120]  disease they had antibodies in their blood plasma they could extract that and
[02:38:22.120 --> 02:38:26.680]  give it to the people who are already symptomatic who are already sick you
[02:38:26.680 --> 02:38:29.800]  know once you're already sick it's not really going to be possible for a
[02:38:29.800 --> 02:38:33.920]  vaccine to do anything to help you because your body is going to have its
[02:38:33.920 --> 02:38:38.480]  hands full trying to fight the real thing instead of this weakened or dead
[02:38:38.480 --> 02:38:42.280]  version of the virus that you're going to be injected with so it ain't going to
[02:38:42.280 --> 02:38:45.440]  help you a vaccine once you get it no they're going to give this to everybody
[02:38:45.440 --> 02:38:50.600]  beforehand as a prophylactic saying that that's going to keep us from getting
[02:38:50.600 --> 02:38:55.280]  this condition a very frightening prospect when you combine that with the
[02:38:55.280 --> 02:39:02.120]  big push for mandatory vaccines let's go to Rob in Arizona Rob yeah good morning
[02:39:02.120 --> 02:39:06.040]  David thank you for your excellent reporting especially when Alex is away
[02:39:06.040 --> 02:39:10.160]  well thank you are you familiar with the naval weapons station down in Seal
[02:39:10.160 --> 02:39:18.360]  Beach California no I'm not okay it's a huge huge real estate area open field
[02:39:18.360 --> 02:39:23.640]  area right by the ocean Seal Beach and it has these bunkers where the Navy used
[02:39:23.640 --> 02:39:30.680]  to store you know missile ordinance and and so on and these bunkers were above
[02:39:30.680 --> 02:39:33.880]  ground bunkers and they used to be covered with grass so that if you were
[02:39:33.880 --> 02:39:38.200]  flying overhead and you look down you couldn't see that they were bunkers
[02:39:38.200 --> 02:39:42.720]  because it it would look like just all grass well for the past year they've
[02:39:42.720 --> 02:39:47.000]  been totally gutting the place they've removed the camouflage from the bunkers
[02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:52.480]  they have a massive agricultural project going on with migrant workers
[02:39:52.480 --> 02:39:57.400]  working in the fields around these bunkers there are they've electrified
[02:39:57.400 --> 02:40:01.240]  the fence that goes along Westminster Boulevard between Seal Beach Boulevard
[02:40:01.240 --> 02:40:06.920]  and the 405 Freeway and they have armed guards that aren't Navy that don't
[02:40:06.920 --> 02:40:11.760]  appear to be Navy personnel my wife works for an aerospace company down there
[02:40:11.760 --> 02:40:15.960]  and we I go down there frequently to visitor and one of the local residents
[02:40:15.960 --> 02:40:20.520]  in Seal Beach he thinks that they're getting ready to build another FEMA like
[02:40:20.520 --> 02:40:25.800]  internment camp and I want I'm wondering if this is possibly related to the Jade
[02:40:25.800 --> 02:40:30.520]  Helm project that's in the works right now and I'm wondering if it might be
[02:40:30.520 --> 02:40:36.160]  something of interest for Alex and his reporters including you yeah certainly
[02:40:36.160 --> 02:40:41.200]  we'll take a look into it I know that Tully Blackwood has reported to us I
[02:40:41.200 --> 02:40:47.320]  think it's McClellan Air Force Base it's up around where he lives and and they
[02:40:47.320 --> 02:40:50.640]  repurposed that base they they closed down parts of it and they had a lot of
[02:40:50.640 --> 02:40:56.320]  radium waste because they were using that for aircraft instrumentation a lot
[02:40:56.320 --> 02:41:01.880]  of very toxic chemicals in that area they repurposed that military base not
[02:41:01.880 --> 02:41:07.560]  as an internment camp but they were selling it for businesses to use as
[02:41:07.560 --> 02:41:11.760]  office space and other things like that in the radium that was being stored
[02:41:11.760 --> 02:41:15.520]  above ground they just put tarps over it the people they were very concerned
[02:41:15.520 --> 02:41:18.880]  about that because they said they were not going to fly it to a another place
[02:41:18.880 --> 02:41:22.520]  and dispose of it and canisters or anything they were just going to bury
[02:41:22.520 --> 02:41:27.280]  it on site and so people were rightfully concerned that that radium was
[02:41:27.280 --> 02:41:30.960]  going to leak into the water supply so it could be something like that have
[02:41:30.960 --> 02:41:34.720]  they closed that base you think they're reposition that repurposing that base or
[02:41:34.720 --> 02:41:40.440]  is it still operational well they still have the main they still have the main
[02:41:40.440 --> 02:41:47.560]  naval weapons entrance and they've got military personnel at the gate where you
[02:41:47.560 --> 02:41:52.080]  go in but there are other entrance points where other trucks are going in and
[02:41:52.080 --> 02:41:55.560]  out and they've got private security guards it's just it's just too weird it's
[02:41:55.560 --> 02:41:58.760]  just there's something going on down there okay all right yeah we'll take a
[02:41:58.760 --> 02:42:03.320]  look at that thank you so much for the tip thank you Rob let's go to Verderus
[02:42:03.320 --> 02:42:10.560]  in New York Verderus hello David I'm from Fiji female region number two I'd like
[02:42:10.560 --> 02:42:14.960]  to report a prime example of a police state it was covered by the local news
[02:42:14.960 --> 02:42:21.760]  radio WNBF 1290 a couple an elderly couple with a quilting business was no
[02:42:21.760 --> 02:42:27.200]  knock rated by local authorities who possess an MRAP vehicle the actual
[02:42:27.200 --> 02:42:33.120]  judge orders say without giving notice or authority on of your purpose I don't
[02:42:33.120 --> 02:42:35.800]  know if you've heard of this one but I think it would be an excellent one to
[02:42:35.800 --> 02:42:40.960]  look into now what what did they do they said tell me again what they did they
[02:42:40.960 --> 02:42:46.280]  rated a home for for what for what purpose the purpose says the search
[02:42:46.280 --> 02:42:51.000]  warden warden signed by Broom in Tioga County and judges less than 24 hours
[02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:54.760]  below the rate before the raid indicated investigators were looking for
[02:42:54.760 --> 02:43:00.240]  methamphetamine crack cocaine firearms and other things and if you get a chance
[02:43:00.240 --> 02:43:03.640]  to view this couple they're an elderly couple with a quilting business and
[02:43:03.640 --> 02:43:07.720]  they're pulled up here I can see them yeah yeah yeah that's an excellent
[02:43:07.720 --> 02:43:10.920]  report I figured info wars would like to get a chance to look at this one as
[02:43:10.920 --> 02:43:14.520]  well because it just shows how far the police state is gone overboard in our
[02:43:14.520 --> 02:43:20.280]  area so yeah that that's very very disturbing and we see that all the time
[02:43:20.280 --> 02:43:25.920]  we see people getting swatted all the time many times I guess it's kind of
[02:43:25.920 --> 02:43:29.560]  unusual they they had a search warrant I mean in many cases the police are
[02:43:29.560 --> 02:43:32.160]  operating without a search warrant I think one of the things we need to
[02:43:32.160 --> 02:43:37.120]  understand we go back and and we look at these legal checks and balances that
[02:43:37.120 --> 02:43:40.120]  were put in there for the police many times people just want to get rid of
[02:43:40.120 --> 02:43:44.920]  that it's kind of a dirty hairy mentality you know that was deliberately
[02:43:44.920 --> 02:43:49.440]  set up in the Clint Eastwood films you know you see this guy this serial
[02:43:49.440 --> 02:43:55.200]  killer murderer and he can continually gets off and so the whole thing is
[02:43:55.200 --> 02:44:00.720]  orchestrated so that the public is cheering on this this cop dirty hairy
[02:44:00.720 --> 02:44:04.680]  who's just going to shoot him on sight because he's fed up with the law letting
[02:44:04.680 --> 02:44:09.800]  off a a guilty person and of course that is always a possibility and that kind of
[02:44:09.800 --> 02:44:13.560]  thing does happen that the people when you put in checks and balances people
[02:44:13.560 --> 02:44:18.480]  can get off with technicalities but when we let the police go when we remove all
[02:44:18.480 --> 02:44:24.200]  of the blocks that are put in there for very good reasons then we have a much
[02:44:24.200 --> 02:44:27.960]  worse situation it isn't a matter of of whether or not we're going to get all
[02:44:27.960 --> 02:44:32.720]  the bad guys and put them away or we're gonna let them loose it isn't a binary
[02:44:32.720 --> 02:44:36.680]  function it isn't a one or a zero there's never going to be a perfect
[02:44:36.680 --> 02:44:40.000]  solution to anything but we have to understand that the most dangerous
[02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:44.760]  situation that we can have is a government that is shorn itself from
[02:44:44.760 --> 02:44:49.840]  any legal chains anything that's going to stop it or check it or balance it and
[02:44:49.840 --> 02:44:53.600]  that's what we have basically created with this war on drugs and SWAT teams are
[02:44:53.600 --> 02:44:56.680]  a perfect example then that's what they just did to this couple right here
[02:44:56.680 --> 02:45:00.320]  that you're talking about it's a couple that has absolutely no reason for them
[02:45:00.320 --> 02:45:05.000]  to think that that's a meth lab and they put that on the search warrant go in
[02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:09.200]  many times people are killed in these raids because especially the innocent
[02:45:09.200 --> 02:45:12.640]  people are not expecting somebody to kick in their door with a no-knock raid
[02:45:12.640 --> 02:45:18.320]  but this all began as a justification for the war on drugs just as we see civil
[02:45:18.320 --> 02:45:23.480]  asset forfeiture beginning that way and even before that when Nixon went in with
[02:45:23.480 --> 02:45:26.880]  the Rico statutes again a perfect example of this dirty hairy mentality
[02:45:26.880 --> 02:45:31.720]  saying we cannot get convictions against these organized crime bosses
[02:45:31.720 --> 02:45:34.520]  because they've got too much money they can hire the best lawyers and they can
[02:45:34.520 --> 02:45:37.520]  get out on technicality so what we're going to do and make sure we can put
[02:45:37.520 --> 02:45:41.920]  these guys away because we know they're part of the mafia we're going to seize
[02:45:41.920 --> 02:45:46.560]  their assets first that way they won't be able to hire good lawyers and we'll
[02:45:46.560 --> 02:45:51.040]  get them put away now people looked at that and they had some very high profile
[02:45:51.040 --> 02:45:54.480]  cases where they did put away some organized crime figures and people said
[02:45:54.480 --> 02:45:58.280]  yeah that's good it's good we got a Rico statute what they did though was they
[02:45:58.280 --> 02:46:03.320]  broke fundamentally our system of justice where you have to convict somebody
[02:46:03.320 --> 02:46:08.120]  before you can take their property and so now we've seen for the last 20 30 40
[02:46:08.120 --> 02:46:14.160]  years we've seen that they can go in and accuse you of having cash that smells
[02:46:14.160 --> 02:46:18.440]  like it's got cocaine on it because virtually all the cash does smell like
[02:46:18.440 --> 02:46:23.720]  that has residual that can trigger a dog or they had a case for example one of
[02:46:23.720 --> 02:46:29.440]  the cases was a a fellow who had a Learjet business that he ran flying
[02:46:29.440 --> 02:46:33.200]  people he flew a couple of guys who were just business executives in a suit with
[02:46:33.200 --> 02:46:36.640]  briefcases he flew them from the US to Canada they had a meeting then he flew
[02:46:36.640 --> 02:46:40.240]  them back nothing unusual about that that's what he did with people all the
[02:46:40.240 --> 02:46:44.520]  time except these two individuals were doing a drug deal and they were being
[02:46:44.520 --> 02:46:48.200]  watched and wired by the federal government and so when he landed back in
[02:46:48.200 --> 02:46:52.080]  America they arrested these two individuals and they impounded his plane
[02:46:52.080 --> 02:46:57.600]  they knew and they said that he had absolutely nothing to do with this drug
[02:46:57.600 --> 02:47:04.760]  deal nevertheless they charged his plane with being an accessory to the crime so
[02:47:04.760 --> 02:47:08.160]  as US government versus Learjet serial number blah blah blah it took him over
[02:47:08.160 --> 02:47:12.480]  two years to get his property back he was one of the few people that was
[02:47:12.480 --> 02:47:16.680]  successful in terms of getting it back nevertheless it did ruin his business
[02:47:16.680 --> 02:47:19.640]  he had to declare bankruptcy because that was his only asset as that was a
[02:47:19.640 --> 02:47:23.120]  way that he ran his business they essentially confiscated all of his
[02:47:23.120 --> 02:47:27.240]  business assets never for once pretending that he was involved in this drug
[02:47:27.240 --> 02:47:30.600]  deal or had any knowledge whatsoever of it they never indicted him or charged him
[02:47:30.600 --> 02:47:35.960]  with anything but they went after his property and that kind of what you want
[02:47:35.960 --> 02:47:39.960]  to call it Alice in Wonderland or Franz Kafka world that they have created
[02:47:39.960 --> 02:47:45.480]  based on the war on drugs that is what we're seeing now and that needs to be
[02:47:45.480 --> 02:47:48.520]  shut down as I pointed out I think the only hope that we've got of doing that
[02:47:48.520 --> 02:47:52.760]  is at the state level that's where we're seeing people push back we're
[02:47:52.760 --> 02:47:56.520]  legalizing marijuana for medical use we're legalizing it for recreational
[02:47:56.520 --> 02:48:00.520]  use because you don't have the constitutional authority I'll say it
[02:48:00.520 --> 02:48:05.840]  again to prohibit marijuana they needed a special amendment to the
[02:48:05.840 --> 02:48:08.920]  Constitution to give them that power for alcohol and then there was another
[02:48:08.920 --> 02:48:14.760]  amendment that took it away again the 18th and the 21st I believe so they
[02:48:14.760 --> 02:48:19.400]  needed a special amendment to do that why well because in those days we
[02:48:19.400 --> 02:48:22.600]  actually thought the Constitution mattered we actually pretended that it did
[02:48:22.600 --> 02:48:27.000]  matter and they have no legal authority under the 9th and 10th amendment
[02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:31.200]  unless the government is specifically given the power they don't have it but
[02:48:31.200 --> 02:48:34.160]  of course they operate just the other way they say everything is prohibited
[02:48:34.160 --> 02:48:40.000]  unless we expressly permit it that's not true so the very fact that they would
[02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:46.200]  have anything like marijuana any of these drugs or any non psychoactive drugs
[02:48:46.200 --> 02:48:49.680]  that you just need for medicine that that it would be prohibited unless it's
[02:48:49.680 --> 02:48:54.640]  expressly permitted by the FDA that is turning the Constitution on its head and
[02:48:54.640 --> 02:48:58.600]  that destroys fundamentally our system of checks and balances our rule of law
[02:48:58.600 --> 02:49:02.080]  and the way this works out is seeing elderly couple like this get swat
[02:49:02.080 --> 02:49:05.880]  teamed and could have been killed as as you report anything else you want to
[02:49:05.880 --> 02:49:10.840]  advert us before I move on I just like to point out how disconnected the local
[02:49:10.840 --> 02:49:15.000]  authorities have become from the public and they haven't they don't even attempt
[02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:20.240]  to go and ask these people or interview them or talk to them or even visit the
[02:49:20.240 --> 02:49:25.800]  premises obviously because it's such it's so obviously wrong yeah so trigger
[02:49:25.800 --> 02:49:28.880]  happy and ready to get in their MRAT vehicle and go over there and play
[02:49:28.880 --> 02:49:32.360]  soldier when they're not they're public servants and they need to know their
[02:49:32.360 --> 02:49:35.880]  role if they want to be soldiers they should join the military like so many
[02:49:35.880 --> 02:49:38.720]  other good men and women have well that's the thing that's very troubling
[02:49:38.720 --> 02:49:42.360]  about is militarization of it and of course you're in New York but take a
[02:49:42.360 --> 02:49:45.320]  look at that New Jersey bill let's keep an eye on that and see if Chris Christie

[02:53:56.840 --> 02:54:00.360]  me about a recent incident in New Jersey we're just talking in the last
[02:54:00.360 --> 02:54:05.320]  segment caller pointed out about a an elderly couple that got swatted by the
[02:54:05.320 --> 02:54:10.440]  police thought that they had a meth lab going they didn't have anything of the
[02:54:10.440 --> 02:54:16.120]  sort but of course being swatted is turning into a very dangerous prank
[02:54:16.120 --> 02:54:19.360]  that's being played on a lot of people in this particular case in New Jersey this
[02:54:19.360 --> 02:54:23.920]  is at a video store they called the SWAT team out said there was some kind of a
[02:54:23.920 --> 02:54:30.360]  emergency hostage situation the people saw the police showing up in mass they
[02:54:30.360 --> 02:54:33.320]  kind of moved to the basement they were getting concerned because they saw the
[02:54:33.320 --> 02:54:37.680]  police massing outside then the person who had done the SWAT prank called the
[02:54:37.680 --> 02:54:40.880]  video store and said he was the fire department that they needed to close the
[02:54:40.880 --> 02:54:45.480]  window and step outside and yell the coast is clear that point they realized
[02:54:45.480 --> 02:54:50.000]  that that was a prank nevertheless the SWAT team busted in handcuffed at every
[02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:54.360]  handcuffed everybody and it took a while to sort this thing out a very very
[02:54:54.360 --> 02:54:59.840]  dangerous situation and I have to say that really what is happening with a
[02:54:59.840 --> 02:55:05.480]  lot of these people who are pushing for prohibition they are SWAT teaming the
[02:55:05.480 --> 02:55:10.760]  country because prohibition is essentially a prank that's being played on
[02:55:10.760 --> 02:55:16.280]  all of us by people who want power using a war on drugs you understand of course
[02:55:16.280 --> 02:55:21.160]  that we are intimately involved with the production of these drugs in
[02:55:21.160 --> 02:55:24.560]  Afghanistan and Central and South America you understand as Gary Webb
[02:55:24.560 --> 02:55:29.160]  pointed out that it was the US government the CIA that created the crack
[02:55:29.160 --> 02:55:35.480]  cocaine epidemic in LA and we've seen pictures of Geraldo Rivera covering the
[02:55:35.480 --> 02:55:38.680]  fact that we've got American troops guarding the poppy fields in Afghanistan
[02:55:38.680 --> 02:55:47.520]  of course the supply of opium and opiate based drugs has gone from 10% of the
[02:55:47.520 --> 02:55:51.760]  Taliban to over 90% of the world's supply coming out of there since we took
[02:55:51.760 --> 02:55:57.800]  over so that's what this is all about we grow the drugs we create the drugs we
[02:55:57.800 --> 02:56:01.520]  fly the drugs in we create the prohibition on the other side we're
[02:56:01.520 --> 02:56:08.440]  playing good cop and bad cop at the same time the casualty is your rights the
[02:56:08.440 --> 02:56:12.920]  casualty is the rule of law and in many cases the casualties are people's lives
[02:56:12.920 --> 02:56:17.480]  not just being killed in SWAT team raids but being having their lives lost
[02:56:17.480 --> 02:56:22.840]  through mandatory minimums locking nonviolent people up for decades let's
[02:56:22.840 --> 02:56:30.120]  go to rich in New Jersey rich hey it's an honor to talk to you thank you thank
[02:56:30.120 --> 02:56:34.320]  you for calling what's on line David Alex is always talking about the
[02:56:34.320 --> 02:56:40.080]  revolution of ideas and you know last week this story broke about the FEMA

[02:56:45.760 --> 02:56:50.640]  of domes I mean one of the things that I believe can get us out of this mess is
[02:56:50.640 --> 02:56:55.400]  if we look at society and the way we live on the planet and and look at ways
[02:56:55.400 --> 02:57:00.960]  that we might be able to improve it and dome you know living in dome homes is a
[02:57:00.960 --> 02:57:05.080]  concept that isn't naturally embraced by people because everybody wants to live
[02:57:05.080 --> 02:57:10.280]  in their stick and nail-based wood boxes but there's a company up in Italy

[02:58:51.160 --> 02:58:56.200]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information
[02:58:56.200 --> 02:59:06.760]  war continues it's alex jones and the GCN radio network
[02:59:06.760 --> 02:59:09.400]  welcome back to the alex jones show gonna go into overdrive and try to take
[02:59:09.400 --> 02:59:11.960]  some of the colors who've been on hold that just before the break we were
[02:59:11.960 --> 02:59:16.680]  talking to rich in new jersey rich you're pointing out that as these stories
[02:59:16.680 --> 02:59:22.200]  broke about FEMA producing domes that kind of demonize the whole idea of of
[02:59:22.200 --> 02:59:26.840]  dome homes I'm familiar with the company you mentioned there's a lot of people
[02:59:26.840 --> 02:59:31.320]  that make make domes I think it's a very good thing it's a very energy
[02:59:31.320 --> 02:59:36.360]  efficient way to build a home it makes a very strong home it makes a home that
[02:59:36.360 --> 02:59:41.320]  is safe from tornadoes and that sort of things and that's what FEMA is saying
[02:59:41.320 --> 02:59:45.080]  that they're doing this for and I guess really rich the problem that people
[02:59:45.080 --> 02:59:51.240]  have is with FEMA and not so much domes and I think if people think that
[02:59:51.240 --> 02:59:53.960]  there's something sinister about domes they really don't understand what's
[02:59:53.960 --> 02:59:56.920]  going on but I do think that we should question
[02:59:56.920 --> 03:00:01.160]  the actions of FEMA because in most cases
[03:00:01.160 --> 03:00:05.240]  they go in and they in an actual emergencies it was a very good case of
[03:00:05.240 --> 03:00:09.160]  it in North Carolina that my son covered
[03:00:09.160 --> 03:00:12.280]  where you looked at two different responses one of them was large enough
[03:00:12.280 --> 03:00:15.400]  that involved FEMA the other one was taken care of by local
[03:00:15.400 --> 03:00:19.000]  resources and it was just a world of difference
[03:00:19.000 --> 03:00:23.400]  where churches would bring supplies to a parking lot
[03:00:23.400 --> 03:00:26.440]  and the police would guard people from down power lines but
[03:00:26.440 --> 03:00:30.120]  basically not interfere with people that the churches businesses would bring
[03:00:30.120 --> 03:00:34.040]  food in dump it on church parking lots the churches and other people would
[03:00:34.040 --> 03:00:37.240]  come in and distribute it to the people who needed it but in other areas where
[03:00:37.240 --> 03:00:41.240]  FEMA got involved they locked everything down wouldn't let people get to their
[03:00:41.240 --> 03:00:44.680]  home so I think the problem people have is is with FEMA and not so much with the
[03:00:44.680 --> 03:00:48.520]  domes rich well David I agree with you but domes are
[03:00:48.520 --> 03:00:52.120]  like they're a subject matter that people just like to make fun of
[03:00:52.120 --> 03:00:54.600]  and they don't really have an understanding of all the positive
[03:00:54.600 --> 03:00:58.120]  points that you mentioned they are energy efficient they are disaster
[03:00:58.120 --> 03:01:02.840]  resistant and I just firmly believe that you know a program of rebuilding
[03:01:02.840 --> 03:01:06.680]  America with with modern structures that are
[03:01:06.680 --> 03:01:10.600]  better for us as a people I mean most of America is living in houses that were
[03:01:10.600 --> 03:01:14.200]  built in the 40s through the 60s. Oh yeah absolutely yeah I'm a big
[03:01:14.200 --> 03:01:17.960]  fan of thinking outside the box and and and domes are definitely outside the
[03:01:17.960 --> 03:01:21.080]  box they've got their own unique shape and of course there's a lot of earth
[03:01:21.080 --> 03:01:24.200]  berm designs as well that I think are very effective thanks Rich.
[03:01:24.200 --> 03:01:28.440]  Let's go to Ned in Oregon Ned
[03:01:29.400 --> 03:01:35.160]  oh okay we missed missed Ed okay let's go to Nick in Maryland Nick
[03:01:35.160 --> 03:01:38.680]  it's a pleasure thanks so much for taking my call longtime listener first time
[03:01:38.680 --> 03:01:42.040]  caller just a quick statement here and then I'll hang up and listen to your
[03:01:42.040 --> 03:01:45.320]  response but someone I subscribed to on YouTube
[03:01:45.320 --> 03:01:49.800]  was breaking down Jade Helm and I just thought it was interesting at face value
[03:01:49.800 --> 03:01:54.120]  where using the first word obviously Jade having references back to the
[03:01:54.120 --> 03:01:57.720]  Chinese civilization even all the way back to 6000 BC
[03:01:57.720 --> 03:02:01.800]  and second word helm obviously for someone who's in control or at the helm
[03:02:01.800 --> 03:02:05.320]  just wanted to think I mean you know so many times in our history we've seen
[03:02:05.320 --> 03:02:09.720]  all of these drills being run prior to false flags I mean I don't know if it
[03:02:09.720 --> 03:02:12.760]  could be any more blatantly obvious and I just thought it was an
[03:02:12.760 --> 03:02:16.200]  interesting connection that they had made I hadn't really heard you guys talk
[03:02:16.200 --> 03:02:19.160]  about it but thank you so much for everything you guys do thank you
[03:02:19.160 --> 03:02:22.120]  blessing to our country and god bless you and the whole team down there at
[03:02:22.120 --> 03:02:24.520]  Info Wars. Thank you yeah I have no idea why they
[03:02:24.520 --> 03:02:27.800]  picked the terms Jade Helm yeah I can only speculate
[03:02:27.800 --> 03:02:30.680]  personally I look at it and I think Jade Helm
[03:02:30.680 --> 03:02:33.240]  kind of along the lines you're talking about you know and think about
[03:02:33.240 --> 03:02:36.040]  something somebody being jaded to something that means that they're
[03:02:36.040 --> 03:02:39.800]  kind of accustomed to it and I think that it's clearly an
[03:02:39.800 --> 03:02:43.640]  operation where they're trying to get us accustomed to it that's a big part
[03:02:43.640 --> 03:02:47.720]  of the PSYOP and they admit that this unconventional warfare training is
[03:02:47.720 --> 03:02:51.000]  largely PSYOP they want to get us accustomed they want to get us
[03:02:51.000 --> 03:02:54.920]  jaded to the military presence in our midst and I think that's a very
[03:02:54.920 --> 03:02:58.520]  dangerous thing in and of itself thank you Nick let's go to Chelsea
[03:02:58.520 --> 03:03:05.880]  in Arizona Chelsea. Hello David. Hi. I just wanted to tell you
[03:03:05.880 --> 03:03:11.080]  um I'm in the funeral industry um and in the last couple weeks we've been
[03:03:11.080 --> 03:03:15.560]  getting um a number of calls from I don't know what kind of agency they are
[03:03:15.560 --> 03:03:21.000]  maybe statistical or um preparedness I don't know what
[03:03:21.000 --> 03:03:24.520]  agency they're from but we've only got about 20 seconds
[03:03:24.520 --> 03:03:29.160]  hurry hurry yes what do you get calls for what that's how many bodies they can
[03:03:29.160 --> 03:03:32.680]  put through our crematories in one day
[03:03:32.680 --> 03:03:36.680]  really and you say this is coming from what agency
[03:03:36.680 --> 03:03:39.800]  I don't know exactly what agency they won't tell us
[03:03:39.800 --> 03:03:45.560]  when we ask them what the if this is for they say if there was some type of
[03:03:45.560 --> 03:03:49.400]  oh very interesting well hang on we'll talk to you about that um thank you for
[03:03:49.400 --> 03:04:03.480]  listening we'll be back tomorrow
