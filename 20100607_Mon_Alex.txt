[03:35.400 --> 03:40.280]  Bloomberg reporting on Bilderberg member Nackie is reportedly there and I've
[03:40.280 --> 03:45.800]  videotaped him myself and looked into his little beady eyes in 2008 driving in
[03:45.800 --> 03:49.840]  and armored limousine he's reportedly there but the Federal Reserve says no
[03:49.840 --> 03:53.720]  he's not there kind of like them lying about Hillary being there in 2008 or
[03:53.720 --> 03:59.040]  2006 and we know she was both occasions so they're a pack of liars they love
[03:59.040 --> 04:04.200]  lying to you but it's in Bloomberg and Bloomberg says well I guess there is a
[04:04.200 --> 04:09.960]  world government and this isn't really a conspiracy amazing out of Bloomberg I
[04:09.960 --> 04:14.000]  mean such a victory that we can now actually address the real corrupt

[09:30.800 --> 09:34.040]  aftermath of it and the new developments the things that unfolded
[09:34.040 --> 09:40.440]  Saturday and Sunday and they are extremely important namely Tucker told us
[09:40.440 --> 09:47.840]  Friday that for the first time ever the vast majority of Bilderberg group
[09:47.840 --> 09:54.200]  attendees are green light attack on Iran and then I noticed Saturday and Sunday I
[09:54.200 --> 09:59.280]  saw headlines about more nations back sanctions on Iran more nations back war
[09:59.280 --> 10:05.920]  with Iran and what is Iran doing saying okay we're gonna send armed ships with
[10:05.920 --> 10:11.040]  the next flotella in the Gaza and at a primitive level people are like good let
[10:11.040 --> 10:15.680]  them get the aid in you know stand up you know don't let those armed Israelis
[10:15.680 --> 10:20.720]  go after those innocent boats yeah but Israel has nuclear weapons we don't want
[10:20.720 --> 10:24.640]  to give Israel an excuse to raise tensions or Iran an excuse to raise
[10:24.640 --> 10:30.400]  tensions and end up with a nuclear war come on folks come on you know what's
[10:30.400 --> 10:34.560]  gonna happen to the economy bare minimum of tripling and oil prices if they block
[10:34.560 --> 10:38.400]  the straight or moose and that's the minimum Iran's gonna do you know what
[10:38.400 --> 10:43.440]  that's gonna do to the economy I mean at a primitive macho level it's like good
[10:43.440 --> 10:52.960]  killing my radians bomb them right now new come I love it parking lot well first
[10:52.960 --> 10:55.480]  you've got to learn how to find Iran on the map before you're allowed to say
[10:55.480 --> 10:59.240]  newcombe but then once you've done that you can't you got to stop calling them
[10:59.240 --> 11:05.520]  a rabs them towel head I a rappers you know first you got to know their their
[11:05.520 --> 11:09.280]  their their Persians at least know who you're wanting to kill and then you've
[11:09.280 --> 11:13.320]  got to understand what that's gonna do with Russia and China listen ladies and
[11:13.320 --> 11:18.680]  gentlemen we can have another world war we don't want that I know some of you
[11:18.680 --> 11:22.440]  are bored and think it'll be entertaining it's not gonna be entertaining
[11:22.440 --> 11:30.720]  it's not gonna be fun you don't want it doesn't need to happen Israeli
[11:30.720 --> 11:34.960]  military took control the Rachel Corey on Friday and directed it in reportedly
[11:34.960 --> 11:41.320]  there was no violence that's the good news the bad news is Israelis killed five
[11:41.320 --> 11:45.160]  scuba divers off the coast of Gaza claiming they were terrorists but
[11:45.160 --> 11:47.680]  witnesses reported they would look like they were just off the coast with no
[11:47.680 --> 11:52.000]  targets around them in scuba gear so it's the same commandos that reportedly
[11:52.000 --> 12:00.480]  boarded the ship last Monday so another big PR disaster on that front that's
[12:00.480 --> 12:06.840]  all coming up but let me just get into the economy first here okay least hit
[12:06.840 --> 12:17.080]  some of these headlines world stocks hit by fears over us jobs and the plunging
[12:17.080 --> 12:24.080]  economy in Hungary us a 13 trillion dollar debt poised to overtake GDP
[12:24.080 --> 12:29.080]  Bloomberg chart of the day that's right our debt is set to overtake our entire
[12:29.080 --> 12:33.240]  GDP which is what it's designed to do total slaves of the bankers but breaking
[12:33.240 --> 12:38.480]  that down more today in five years UK will be spending more on interest than
[12:38.480 --> 12:43.760]  schools climate and transport combined oh that's out of business insider oh we've
[12:43.760 --> 12:47.840]  got to spend money on the climate yes saving it give Al Gore money or the
[12:47.840 --> 12:54.840]  earth will die Germany to unveil cuts to welfare and jobs see see they raise
[12:54.840 --> 12:58.280]  your taxes in the name of the social welfare net and then once the bankers
[12:58.280 --> 13:02.040]  get you in debt they take it all away that's what you foolish low-level
[13:02.040 --> 13:07.640]  leftist don't understand the money goes to the bankers with their trillions and
[13:07.640 --> 13:12.680]  bonuses got it got it understand that big governments for and by the bankers
[13:12.680 --> 13:17.760]  got that all you stupid mainline liberals and all you stupid mainline
[13:17.760 --> 13:22.600]  conservatives they're like corporations never do wrong they're good we need the
[13:22.600 --> 13:27.560]  big insurance companies around health care we we we the banks are good no
[13:27.560 --> 13:33.280]  they're not no they're not free market just shut up all of you are mainline
[13:33.280 --> 13:39.200]  people out there that buying the mainstream media garbage or fools it's a
[13:39.200 --> 13:43.600]  false paradigm Europe is heading for a mini-depression counterbunch reports
[13:43.600 --> 13:47.520]  counterpunches some good folks but no they're already in a depression okay so
[13:47.520 --> 13:51.880]  are we it's not a mini-depression ladies and gentlemen we have a higher debt
[13:51.880 --> 13:55.040]  ratio in Europe and the United States than they had in the depth of the great
[13:55.040 --> 14:01.400]  depression 1933 US will be like Greece in seven to ten years say congressmen and
[14:01.400 --> 14:11.920]  experts seven to ten years how about one year college students this is your
[14:11.920 --> 14:17.600]  future high unemployment and student loan hell we got Gerald Salente coming on
[14:17.600 --> 14:22.520]  either Tuesday or Wednesday to break that down for-profit colleges reap big
[14:22.520 --> 14:26.040]  benefit from stimulus yeah they're getting the government money and then
[14:26.040 --> 14:31.040]  you don't most people getting these getting these degrees and being a
[14:31.040 --> 14:35.680]  hundred thousand plus dollars in debt unless you're getting a government job
[14:35.680 --> 14:40.800]  you're not getting one at a level of PhDs with 711 jobs or Walmart jobs of
[14:40.800 --> 14:49.040]  course 95% of new job hiring is government see it's a takeover rating cut
[14:49.040 --> 14:53.360]  by Finch on wealthiest US state per capita Connecticut is the wealthiest
[14:53.360 --> 14:58.040]  state kind of the bedroom community for the Wall Street hooligans and they've
[14:58.040 --> 15:04.120]  now lost their triple a rating just like California is about to lose it then
[15:04.120 --> 15:08.320]  that means you pay higher interest to the bankers with made-up money they get
[15:08.320 --> 15:12.440]  the whole world the whole world in their filthy hands because we won't wake up to
[15:12.440 --> 15:17.320]  scam so we're gonna be going over some of that also world stocks again hit by
[15:17.320 --> 15:21.400]  fears over US job losses and hungry plunging we're gonna again get back
[15:21.400 --> 15:28.160]  into that coming up a little bit later on the Bilderberg front Sages Spain the
[15:28.160 --> 15:32.640]  Bilderberg group now has a website Bilderberg meetings before the last four
[15:32.640 --> 15:39.000]  years they would release a fax and they had to do that because of four year
[15:39.000 --> 15:43.680]  requests to find out what government officials are there they just preempted
[15:43.680 --> 15:47.680]  now but they also lie about it we've caught them lying about Bernanke being
[15:47.680 --> 15:56.000]  there Hillary Barack H. Obama Barry Sataro and so they released the names
[15:56.000 --> 15:59.720]  but we already have photographs of some of the people that aren't on this list
[15:59.720 --> 16:11.840]  so lots of deception there but William Gates bill Bill Gates is is on the list
[16:11.840 --> 16:19.880]  continuing Bilderberg wants Americans disarmed and dependent on government and
[16:19.880 --> 16:23.120]  then Paul Watson as an excellent article going over Tucker saying that was one of
[16:23.120 --> 16:27.400]  the main things on their agenda is we've got to disarm these slaves and then he
[16:27.400 --> 16:31.360]  also then links to all the mainstream news about the UN treaty to basically ban
[16:31.360 --> 16:35.080]  importation of all small arms and the federal government says under that
[16:35.080 --> 16:41.080]  treaty that that supersedes US law that they will ban the Second Amendment for
[16:41.080 --> 16:44.800]  citizens big news need to get this out to everybody
[16:44.800 --> 16:50.640]  Bilderberg wants Americans disarmed and dependent on government and of course
[16:50.640 --> 16:56.200]  what did Charlie Skelton last week on Wednesday evening the night before they
[16:56.200 --> 17:02.680]  threw everybody out for the he was there London Guardian reporter and he's in the
[17:02.680 --> 17:07.920]  dinner in there in the in the hotel five-star lounge and right next to him

[17:14.760 --> 17:20.880]  then they had the head believe they were black badges you have green badges red
[17:20.880 --> 17:25.680]  badges yellow badges and others logistics are green but Skelton sitting
[17:25.680 --> 17:28.920]  right next to him for an hour and a half and heard him talking about how
[17:28.920 --> 17:32.200]  horrible it is that people have enough money to travel there to protest them
[17:32.200 --> 17:36.200]  and that they basically see that the citizens having any jobs or any economy
[17:36.200 --> 17:42.800]  is their welfare large yes you understand them even allowing you any job
[17:42.800 --> 17:46.280]  you know start your own factory they're going to allow that with their carbon
[17:46.280 --> 17:49.800]  taxes they don't want to you won't they're gonna allow you to have a car

[26:23.160 --> 26:27.280]  course the Bilderberg group is scared to death of course I mean remember just four
[26:27.280 --> 26:29.880]  or five years ago they were still making fun of you if you talked about the
[26:29.880 --> 26:34.280]  Bilderberg group national talk show hosts were going can I have some cheese with
[26:34.280 --> 26:39.640]  my Bilderberger I mean I heard that joke for 15 years oh they're not laughing
[26:39.640 --> 26:44.120]  anymore because we didn't care what the media said about us we didn't care about
[26:44.120 --> 26:50.720]  the demonization we didn't care about the propaganda we didn't care about the
[26:50.720 --> 26:56.320]  new world order calling us names we just covered the facts and said these bankers
[26:56.320 --> 27:00.200]  are issuing derivatives it's basically a counterfeit instrument they're buying up
[27:00.200 --> 27:03.640]  the world with it they're setting up a police state ahead of their implosion
[27:03.640 --> 27:07.840]  of the economy they're gonna put brain scanners and naked body scanners in by

[27:20.880 --> 27:27.560]  going for broke because they don't have much time and so to the police the
[27:27.560 --> 27:33.080]  military to all of you you better decide what team you're on you better decide
[27:33.080 --> 27:36.440]  whether you're gonna stand with your family in the republic or whether
[27:36.440 --> 27:39.960]  you're going to go with the new world order who is going to destroy you at
[27:39.960 --> 27:42.840]  least your financial future is going to be destroyed and probably your physical
[27:42.840 --> 27:47.040]  future if you don't wake up now and get angry and the general public you better
[27:47.040 --> 27:50.520]  stop thinking me for speaking out standing up and being involved I'm just
[27:50.520 --> 27:56.480]  trying to engage and solve preservation here what else am I supposed to do what
[27:56.480 --> 28:02.280]  was I supposed to do as a man who by the age of 19 was pretty much fully awake
[28:02.280 --> 28:06.400]  of what was going on I know I was supposed to be chasing skirts and
[28:06.400 --> 28:11.960]  drinking beer doesn't mean I didn't do some of that but at the same time I had
[28:11.960 --> 28:17.240]  studied history I thought that's what a man was supposed to do I was involved in
[28:17.240 --> 28:21.000]  history I knew about what my family had done in history and I knew the job I had
[28:21.000 --> 28:27.360]  to do okay the media tells you you're supposed to be a sophomoric arrested
[28:27.360 --> 28:32.840]  development idiot well that's what slaves are into not me not me I'm a
[28:32.840 --> 28:38.080]  wild man I want freedom and so you better look in the mirror ladies and
[28:38.080 --> 28:42.080]  gentlemen you better ask yourselves right now where you're going to be what

[29:04.880 --> 29:08.360]  globalists run over you and steal everything you got because history has
[29:08.360 --> 29:13.320]  proven 100% of the time when you lay down and aren't involved in society and
[29:13.320 --> 29:18.240]  when you are a foolish buffoon who knows all about the latest fashions and how
[29:18.240 --> 29:23.480]  to act cool and how to be trendy fashion and trendiness is the mark of

[33:48.460 --> 33:52.540]  point I was listening to an ad that I cut for solar power generators during the
[33:52.540 --> 34:00.260]  break and I have a line in there about there's legislation all over the
[34:00.260 --> 34:03.580]  country with smart meters in your home and business where the government
[34:03.580 --> 34:11.260]  controls your thermostats and it just hit me again that I remember a decade ago
[34:11.260 --> 34:17.380]  they were proposing it in California I read the government and MIT and other
[34:17.380 --> 34:20.940]  reports they said we're gonna control everybody's house we're gonna have smart
[34:20.940 --> 34:24.780]  refrigerators that track everything that's in your refrigerator then CPS will
[34:24.780 --> 34:28.300]  be called your children aren't eating healthy elder care will be called on old
[34:28.300 --> 34:33.300]  people to take them basically to be euthanized you know he described to
[34:33.300 --> 34:39.660]  government care but they're phasing in the euthanasia Europe already has it and
[34:39.660 --> 34:44.580]  we're gonna remote control people's thermostats and we're not gonna let
[34:44.580 --> 34:49.380]  people have it set at 75 76 you know we'll get people trained incrementally to

[35:52.660 --> 35:56.620]  government reports 20 years ago how they plan to have us doing weekly census
[35:56.620 --> 36:00.420]  and they're gonna have an environmental chief on every block that comes in and
[36:00.420 --> 36:04.380]  inspects your house this is all slave training what do you think it is when
[36:04.380 --> 36:08.620]  they take your baby's blood at birth or 37 years and put it in a Pentagon database
[36:08.620 --> 36:12.220]  and now they admit it to you see they think your slaves now they think you're
[36:12.220 --> 36:16.500]  broke back I'd tell you about a 15 years ago you'd laugh the government would
[36:16.500 --> 36:19.980]  never do that now they just admit it you go well I guess it's good oh they're
[36:19.980 --> 36:23.060]  gonna put you through naked body scanners and admit they're recording you
[36:23.060 --> 36:27.820]  and your family's genitals and laughing at it it's so bad they laugh at their own
[36:27.820 --> 36:31.380]  employees genitals that to go through it every day until they beat each other up
[36:31.380 --> 36:36.340]  and they print out Hollywood people's genitals and say sign this for me and it
[36:36.340 --> 36:39.860]  comes out in the news and Homeland Security reports admit they're recording
[36:39.860 --> 36:43.420]  your genitals we're gonna record your genitals and we're gonna do it because
[36:43.420 --> 36:49.260]  we like it and now I have mainstream news about brain scanners in the airports
[36:49.260 --> 36:52.900]  hundreds of thousands of innocent people were sent to prison for brain
[36:52.900 --> 36:58.980]  scanners hundreds of thousands people were sent to prison for lie detectors
[36:58.980 --> 37:04.300]  excuse me made up quack machines and they sent them to prison they sent them
[37:04.300 --> 37:08.980]  to death row turns out it's totally made up and fake basically just a way to
[37:08.980 --> 37:12.700]  trick people into admitting they're lying well now they got even fancier now
[37:12.700 --> 37:16.380]  lie detectors aren't admissible in court after 50 years of people exposing them
[37:16.380 --> 37:21.340]  so now they have quack machines robby the robot systems that say you're really a
[37:21.340 --> 37:26.500]  terrorist and they train minimum wage workers on facial expressions that mean
[37:26.500 --> 37:32.340]  you're a terrorist and they tell them you know today we're looking for gray haired
[37:32.340 --> 37:36.540]  women above 70 they may be terrorists that's the alert there's no real alert
[37:36.540 --> 37:43.100]  on 70 year old women that are terrorist they're just having you be trained to go
[37:43.100 --> 37:48.060]  after everybody and see everybody is a terrorist old men with oxygen tanks of
[37:48.060 --> 37:51.980]  their favorites are making people in wheelchairs that can't walk get up or
[37:51.980 --> 37:56.940]  turning them back that's in the news it's all about the absurdity training you
[37:56.940 --> 38:01.220]  to accept absurd oppression because if they can get you to accept over the top
[38:01.220 --> 38:05.380]  ridiculous things you know why does the Marine Corps make people call themselves
[38:05.380 --> 38:09.820]  names and chant stupid slogans and and beat each other up because they can make
[38:09.820 --> 38:13.660]  you do something stupid like grabbing your genitals and marching down the
[38:13.660 --> 38:17.820]  middle saying this is my rifle this is my gun this is for fighting this is for
[38:17.820 --> 38:21.860]  fun if they can make you do stupid things when they tell you to do other
[38:21.860 --> 38:26.540]  things you're gonna follow those orders I don't I didn't sign up for mind control
[38:26.540 --> 38:30.500]  I didn't sign up to be under mind control you understand that all right I'm
[38:30.500 --> 38:34.180]  going to your calls the point is it just eat it all hit me during the break

[46:54.980 --> 47:00.180]  Congress you thank me for making films what is stopping you from taking action
[47:00.180 --> 47:03.060]  and a lot of people are taking action and that's why the globalists are scared
[47:03.060 --> 47:05.780]  but I'm telling you we don't have much time you've got to launch your info war
[47:05.780 --> 47:11.860]  operations right now banner hangs many documentaries newsletters websites
[47:11.860 --> 47:15.940]  lucky you don't have to do it perfect you know everybody I see everybody wait
[47:15.940 --> 47:19.740]  you know for the perfect opportunity the perfect crafted information or the
[47:19.740 --> 47:25.500]  perfect way to deliver it no just take action it's all we've got all right I'm
[47:25.500 --> 47:30.540]  going to your calls John F. Kennedy in a speech of the White House 62 he said
[47:30.540 --> 47:33.420]  those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution
[47:33.420 --> 47:37.180]  inevitable and Homeland Security probably list him as a terrorist next they
[47:37.180 --> 47:40.660]  already listed Thomas Jefferson and George Washington oh yeah I have the
[47:40.660 --> 47:45.140]  training manuals I video and don't sit there cops and laugh a lot of you've
[47:45.140 --> 47:49.380]  been in the training it's in my film road to tyranny video FEMA teaching cops
[47:49.380 --> 47:53.380]  farming and police that you know it's true let's go ahead and talk to Jeff in
[47:53.380 --> 47:58.660]  California Jeff you're on the air thanks for holding all right Alex hey great
[47:58.660 --> 48:02.540]  job I'll do I have three things I'll make it quick okay I'm a Palmer pipe
[48:02.540 --> 48:06.660]  fitter all right watching the way they put that saw on there they set it up to
[48:06.660 --> 48:11.020]  get pinched you have a whole bat you got a pipe leaning to the right you got the
[48:11.020 --> 48:15.060]  whole backside wide open but they cut it from the side so the pipe can pinch it
[48:15.060 --> 48:19.300]  don't make sense on top of that I noticed that and I'm no genius but they did
[48:19.300 --> 48:24.620]  cut it the way it was leaning and any more on those if a tree's leaning say to
[48:24.620 --> 48:32.140]  the southwest then you go over to the northeast side of the tree to cut it so
[48:32.140 --> 48:35.740]  it will fall the direction it's already leaning so it doesn't fall on you I mean
[48:35.740 --> 48:40.140]  that is a good point and the other thing is that is a flange if you were
[48:40.140 --> 48:43.780]  anybody's familiar with a flange that's how you connect another piece of pipe to
[48:43.780 --> 48:47.740]  another there's a flange here cut the bolts off the flange so the slide two
[48:47.740 --> 48:52.580]  rods up bring a piece of pipe down with a gasket on it over the two rods you put
[48:52.580 --> 48:56.660]  your little bolts in one at a time you got it sealed no they crushed the top to
[48:56.660 --> 49:01.100]  make it worse now my other thing is well here's the deal hold on I'm gonna hold
[49:01.100 --> 49:07.220]  you over if need be but it's time for Watson or Kurt or Steve Aaron's too busy
[49:07.220 --> 49:11.700]  on the film we're working on to do a full report they dump 44% of their stock
[49:11.700 --> 49:17.740]  then about 8% more so it's total of what 52 you know a percent of the of the
[49:17.740 --> 49:22.740]  Goldman Sachs two days before and the day after but 44% two days before it
[49:22.740 --> 49:29.180]  turns out the CEO of BP the chief Tony Hayward sold shares weeks before oil
[49:29.180 --> 49:33.820]  spill the biggest sale ever for him individually and it was all against BP
[49:33.820 --> 49:37.460]  and then the fact that BP is the top globalist oil company one in the carbon
[49:37.460 --> 49:42.100]  tax and now Obama is using this to re kickstart his carbon tax calling it an
[49:42.100 --> 49:47.900]  oil spill tax yes my gut now tells me it's a staged event go ahead okay one
[49:47.900 --> 49:53.260]  more thing now everybody listen up closely this is a possibility this is
[49:53.260 --> 49:57.260]  coming out of a website called just letting you know I want to be on a ball
[49:57.260 --> 50:03.500]  called the Intel hub I don't know if you ever heard of him but basically red
[50:03.500 --> 50:08.780]  alert possibility battle hardened troops on guard arriving in golf with 50
[50:08.780 --> 50:14.300]  millimeter cannons machine guns on top full battle gear waiting for pictures to
[50:14.300 --> 50:19.940]  be sent today it was in Grand Isle Louisiana the report came to us through
[50:19.940 --> 50:24.140]  the scene I don't like listen I appreciate your call Jeff you know I

[54:17.740 --> 54:23.860]  today up 20 dollars let's talk to Tom in Pennsylvania you're on the air Tom
[54:23.860 --> 54:35.140]  welcome so my friend my stupid friend recently got arrested for growing a
[54:35.140 --> 54:41.100]  bunch of marijuana in his house I was just wondering if you had any legal
[54:41.100 --> 54:44.700]  advice I could pass on to him since I know you've talked to people with the
[54:44.700 --> 54:48.500]  well I mean if people got self-control they shouldn't drink they shouldn't
[54:48.500 --> 54:52.700]  smoke pot they shouldn't speed they shouldn't do anything wrong because
[54:52.700 --> 54:57.180]  we're in a criminal government looking for any excuse to throw the book at what
[54:57.180 --> 55:01.620]  they see as the target the enemy is the American people unless you're gonna
[55:01.620 --> 55:06.380]  change your name and poses an illegal alien I wouldn't commit crime you know
[55:06.380 --> 55:09.620]  if you're an illegal illegal alien you mean literally you could even commit
[55:09.620 --> 55:13.180]  serial murders like the railway killer he killed over and over again they kept
[55:13.180 --> 55:17.500]  letting him go if you announce yourself as a god an illegal alien then you'll
[55:17.500 --> 55:21.180]  be left alone but I don't encourage anybody to commit crime must be somewhat
[55:21.180 --> 55:29.420]  sarcastic there I wouldn't grow marijuana and you know I'm I'm not gonna
[55:29.420 --> 55:33.060]  tell him what to do I mean I wouldn't plea bargain if I'd done it I would
[55:33.060 --> 55:37.900]  continue to fight it but that's the decision for him to make Dan I appreciate
[55:37.900 --> 55:42.140]  your call or Tom now we're going to Dan in Minnesota Dan you're on the air go
[55:42.140 --> 55:51.340]  ahead hello Dan welcome hi Alex yes first time call I just got two quick
[55:51.340 --> 55:59.100]  questions for you welcome hi um you and Jim Tucker have been pretty good at
[55:59.100 --> 56:03.620]  exposing now the new the new world order and the Bilderberg group to us slow
[56:03.620 --> 56:08.060]  them down a little bit what are the chances of us slowing down the committee
[56:08.060 --> 56:12.460]  of 300 because aren't they more powerful than the Bilderberg group well look
[56:12.460 --> 56:19.620]  the the committee of 300 doesn't really meet and of course the committee of
[56:19.620 --> 56:24.860]  300 is the larger grouping or the name they give themselves of the elite in
[56:24.860 --> 56:30.180]  Europe the US England and Canada and the Bilderberg group is one of their key
[56:30.180 --> 56:34.820]  meetings steering committees so it's one in the same people get you know the
[56:34.820 --> 56:39.260]  mainstream media always says which is it Alex does the trilateral Commission run
[56:39.260 --> 56:44.340]  it does the Club of Rome run it does the CFR run it does the Royal Commission
[56:44.340 --> 56:50.180]  International Affairs run it does the Bilderberg group run it all of those are
[56:50.180 --> 56:56.500]  chaired and co-chaired and steered by less than 20 people and so the Club of
[56:56.500 --> 57:01.420]  Rome is over environmental takeovers trilateral Commission is between Asia
[57:01.420 --> 57:09.420]  Europe and North America on banking so their specialized corporate bodies that
[57:09.420 --> 57:14.220]  do this but yes the Bilderberg group does have steering committee meetings we
[57:14.220 --> 57:17.980]  should try to go to those trilateral Commission has meetings those are
[57:17.980 --> 57:21.820]  getting confronted Club of Rome has meetings we should go out to all of
[57:21.820 --> 57:25.740]  these but you'll notice when you go to these meetings it's all the same people
[57:25.740 --> 57:33.460]  about once a month the top globalist are meeting somewhere okay thank you and
[57:33.460 --> 57:37.660]  my second question is um I have I'm a divorce and I have a seven-year-old son
[57:37.660 --> 57:42.060]  what um my ex-wife works for the Sheriff's Department and she's one of
[57:42.060 --> 57:46.100]  those people that thinks government is God and will give him any vaccine under
[57:46.100 --> 57:53.380]  the Sun how do you deal with people like that and this is your ex-wife yes well
[57:53.380 --> 57:58.140]  she again she thinks she's getting away with something and showing you and she
[57:58.140 --> 58:03.860]  knows best I would bring her all of the vaccine inserts I'd bring her the H1N1
[58:03.860 --> 58:08.580]  the regular seasonal I would underline Guillain-Barre neurological disorder I
[58:08.580 --> 58:12.660]  would underline Mercury the Marisol and then I would bring fact sheets on each
[58:12.660 --> 58:16.500]  one and say listen honey I'm sure I'm wrong about a lot of things you're on a
[58:16.500 --> 58:20.340]  power trip you know you're the woman you're in charge you've got the uniform
[58:20.340 --> 58:26.220]  I'm just a dumb male but this really does hurt our baby I know out of fear you
[58:26.220 --> 58:30.180]  you give them the shots thinking it's gonna protect them but lots of stuff
[58:30.180 --> 58:35.660]  like hepatitis is only for sexually active or IV drug users please please
[58:35.660 --> 58:39.780]  get on your knees if you have to to these type of slaves they like a power

[1:00:22.100 --> 1:00:35.220]  yeah a fellow was just asking me at the end of the last hour what does he do about his ex-wife he works for a sheriff's department thinks the government's god wants to inject their child with every new vaccine under the sun
[1:00:35.220 --> 1:00:49.940]  get on your knees if you have to these government worshipers all you want to do is save your son from brain damage and cancer and so if you have to get on your knees to her to really get her attention and call her master
[1:00:49.940 --> 1:00:57.700]  that's the type of thing that a power tripping minion likes and if it saves your child is worth it I've always learned you know
[1:00:57.700 --> 1:01:08.820]  if you've got to prostrate yourself before someone to help them or to save someone that's fine it's important to subvert your ego and to basically turn it against itself
[1:01:08.820 --> 1:01:15.460]  but to be serious bring her all the news headlines with Gardasil killing women and not even protecting you
[1:01:15.460 --> 1:01:21.060]  I have medical doctors on from the human papillomavirus uh
[1:01:21.060 --> 1:01:29.940]  give her the actual insert from the drug company and google it and pull it up uh where it admits that it causes cancer infertility brain damage
[1:01:29.940 --> 1:01:35.380]  uh point out to her why do they give hepatitis one of the most admittedly dangerous vaccines of newborn babies
[1:01:35.380 --> 1:01:39.940]  when you only need if you're an intervening drug user or prostitute
[1:01:39.940 --> 1:01:48.020]  and just explain to her look you can't take you know all these unlimited vaccines they're dangerous
[1:01:48.020 --> 1:01:54.100]  uh I had the editor of the british medical journal on a doctor last night talking about how it's
[1:01:54.100 --> 1:02:01.060]  admittedly a hoax the h1n1 they'll give her a whole file of stuff I know charlie sheen had to file an
[1:02:01.060 --> 1:02:08.100]  injunction basically against his wife ex-wife and that worked then he had medical doctors come talk to her
[1:02:08.100 --> 1:02:16.900]  um I don't know but it's an important question by the way I've got to get an article a master
[1:02:16.900 --> 1:02:21.620]  article by a master article an article that doesn't just cover one facet but that our specialty at info wars
[1:02:21.620 --> 1:02:28.100]  dot com and pros and planet dot com is multifaceted multivariate articles that hit things from
[1:02:28.100 --> 1:02:35.460]  different historical angles so you get a full spectrum context of it's getting clearer and clearer
[1:02:35.460 --> 1:02:43.140]  that there is censorship of the oil spill and that everything is pointing towards an inside job
[1:02:43.140 --> 1:02:47.540]  the motive being getting the carbon tax passed that bp has spent billions of dollars of its own
[1:02:47.540 --> 1:02:52.980]  money lobbying for because itself bp itself is an upset area of european private central banking
[1:02:52.980 --> 1:02:59.940]  houses I noticed that articles that paul wanson wrote and others about bill gates would not make
[1:02:59.940 --> 1:03:07.060]  it on google present planet dot com is accepted by google news anything we write is instantly posted
[1:03:07.060 --> 1:03:11.620]  on google news but nothing about bill gates we did test and wrote other articles with bill gates

[1:08:26.900 --> 1:08:34.900]  well helen thomas has now retired drugs report as the headline helen thomas sent to poland
[1:08:36.100 --> 1:08:40.500]  members he said there shouldn't be any jews in uh the middle east in israel
[1:08:40.500 --> 1:08:49.860]  or in the surrounding palestine uh and uh she's now retired she could hardly talk in in the little
[1:08:49.860 --> 1:08:54.260]  video piece she did about you know jews need to go back to poland in germany
[1:08:58.420 --> 1:09:03.940]  so remember david brinkley kind of flipped out on tv and then he retired and a few months later was
[1:09:03.940 --> 1:09:11.540]  dead helen thomas retires in the world of political journalism it's the end of an era helen thomas
[1:09:11.540 --> 1:09:18.020]  has retired just months shy of her 90th birthday a long time white house journalist has covered
[1:09:18.020 --> 1:09:22.500]  every president since white eisenhower and broke several barriers for female journalists but stepped
[1:09:22.500 --> 1:09:27.540]  down from her latest role a columnist for herce newspapers that means she got really about to
[1:09:27.540 --> 1:09:32.900]  get fired they said retire your fired in the wake of the controversial remarks made in late may
[1:09:32.900 --> 1:09:37.860]  about the need for jews to get the hell out of palestine and return to poland in germany
[1:09:38.420 --> 1:09:43.220]  helen thomas announced money that she is retiring effective immediately wrote a statement from her
[1:09:43.220 --> 1:09:48.580]  newspapers on monday and the speaker's bureau she was part of got rid of her too her decision came
[1:09:48.580 --> 1:09:52.900]  after her controversial comments about israel and the palestinians were captured on videotape and
[1:09:52.900 --> 1:09:59.460]  widely disseminated on the internet you know what i'm against her being fired or her resigning uh
[1:09:59.460 --> 1:10:04.740]  just like at the end of the day i'm against the texas film commission pulling funding for the film
[1:10:04.740 --> 1:10:11.460]  machete whether you agree with something or disagree with it it's just dangerous in this age
[1:10:11.460 --> 1:10:17.140]  of censorship uh to see people punish for what they say especially when the government's announcing
[1:10:17.140 --> 1:10:21.620]  they want to shut down everybody's free speech you know the media made a big deal out of the youtube
[1:10:21.620 --> 1:10:29.860]  video and uh she was going to retire anytime anyways and it's just it's a dangerous chilling effect
[1:10:30.420 --> 1:10:35.220]  and uh but a lot of people will celebrate that so there you have it
[1:10:38.420 --> 1:10:42.900]  all right i'm going to take a few of your phone calls i'm going to get into the economic news
[1:10:42.900 --> 1:10:47.540]  in a little more detail uh let's go to curry in florida curry thanks for holding her on the ear
[1:10:47.540 --> 1:10:54.020]  sure thing alex uh clearly we're in the midst of a major paradigm shift it's so exciting to see
[1:10:54.580 --> 1:11:00.900]  three bill de berg articles linked up prominently on drudge with a photo of an anti-individual banner
[1:11:01.700 --> 1:11:06.340]  um i was calling to see have you heard about this cartoon network show that did a fluoride
[1:11:06.340 --> 1:11:13.940]  propaganda episode last night no but they now admit that almost all tv uh fiction and non-fiction is
[1:11:13.940 --> 1:11:21.620]  government financed brainwashing and everything i see is pro fluoride pro microchips pro warrantless
[1:11:21.620 --> 1:11:27.540]  blood taking just in kids show after kids show the mailman will show up and say i need blood to give
[1:11:27.540 --> 1:11:33.300]  you the mail and they give me a little prick and it's fun you know they like uh uh have a little
[1:11:33.300 --> 1:11:39.460]  robot go dude and and painlessly take the blood uh everything's anti-family everything's global
[1:11:39.460 --> 1:11:45.220]  carbon tax it's just total brainwashing and parents turn their kids over to the school for eight hours
[1:11:45.220 --> 1:11:49.300]  a day and the parents cook dinner and watch the football game all their eight-year-olds watching
[1:11:49.300 --> 1:11:56.980]  the cartoons all brainwashing uh tell me about the program it's called squid billies um basically
[1:11:56.980 --> 1:12:02.580]  it's uh you know these the talking octopi are the characters or caricatures of uh redneck hill billies
[1:12:03.140 --> 1:12:08.900]  in the episode one of the squid billies holds an anti-water fluoridation protest where he gives
[1:12:08.900 --> 1:12:14.500]  a speech and he says quote barracusan obama is putting a fluoride in our drinking water to
[1:12:14.500 --> 1:12:19.460]  sterilize our testicles and as a result of the speech all the squid billies they go down to the
[1:12:19.460 --> 1:12:24.740]  river and discharge their shotguns into the river you know to kill the fluoride and then as a result
[1:12:24.740 --> 1:12:30.660]  of killing as a result of killing the fluoride all of their teeth rot and fall out yeah i mean
[1:12:30.660 --> 1:12:35.940]  really you're kidding they actually aired that i i couldn't believe it blew my mind well will somebody
[1:12:35.940 --> 1:12:40.340]  get it and put it up on youtube we'll get a blurb up all this is going to do is wake people up look
[1:12:41.700 --> 1:12:47.940]  um statistically almost i mean literally with the last five six seven eight i haven't seen
[1:12:47.940 --> 1:12:53.780]  them lose it's become big national news every international spelling bee is being won by us
[1:12:53.780 --> 1:13:00.340]  homeschoolers here's the us behind every industrialized country for education but number one winning
[1:13:00.340 --> 1:13:08.580]  all the international spelling bees geography bees science fairs and math quizzes i mean literally
[1:13:08.580 --> 1:13:14.260]  last time i saw it a few years ago it was six or seven times in a row homeschoolers had won the
[1:13:14.260 --> 1:13:19.940]  international spelling bee but it doesn't matter i've been in a dillards and i don't go shopping
[1:13:19.940 --> 1:13:26.580]  more than once or twice a year and i was in a sketchers buying a pair of boots motorcycle
[1:13:26.580 --> 1:13:36.340]  boats years ago and saw homeschooled spelled wrong with an with an image of an airstream
[1:13:36.340 --> 1:13:42.020]  trailer on the front and so you got these fluoride prozac head kids who don't know how to read and
[1:13:42.020 --> 1:13:46.020]  write public school but they know how to act cool and get sexually transmitted diseases and how to
[1:13:46.020 --> 1:13:50.820]  snort cocaine and i'll take red land and then they go buy shirts making fun of the homeschoolers
[1:13:50.820 --> 1:13:57.220]  so so that's basically what's going on and that's just another example and i do see it in movies and
[1:13:57.220 --> 1:14:04.100]  tv where the idiot crazy child abuser is against vaccines and water fluoridation so the the squid
[1:14:04.100 --> 1:14:09.540]  bellies are evil creatures that shoot shotguns at the water believing that can kill the fluoride
[1:14:09.540 --> 1:14:14.660]  and they know that rock obama wants to destroy their well i mean you know what what's funny is
[1:14:14.660 --> 1:14:19.460]  you can print off literally hundreds of articles a year where they admit that suddenly most the
[1:14:19.460 --> 1:14:24.660]  frogs and fish are sterile in reservoirs that have treated water being dumped into them
[1:14:24.660 --> 1:14:30.180]  because of the fluoride and the birth control runoff you know there's pass through women
[1:14:31.140 --> 1:14:37.860]  so i i guess you know really the squid bellies are sterile but also all their teeth fall out i mean
[1:14:37.860 --> 1:14:41.380]  that is of course now the american dental association recommends children under six
[1:14:41.380 --> 1:14:45.700]  don't brush with it because it causes dental ferocious and weakening of the teeth and bone cancer
[1:14:45.700 --> 1:14:53.780]  but i mean i tell you curry is this not desperate oh absolutely i mean the the it's so obvious that
[1:14:53.780 --> 1:14:59.140]  the tide has turned in the info war alex um everybody's waking up i mean of course it's
[1:14:59.140 --> 1:15:04.260]  desperate um just look at the bill over coverage right now it's incredible yeah look at the drugs
[1:15:04.260 --> 1:15:08.340]  report it says uh no down with your new world order in fact i don't have the drugs report up
[1:15:08.340 --> 1:15:14.740]  what's the what's the white sign in spanish say exactly i must already let him go here let me
[1:15:14.740 --> 1:15:20.100]  load it i don't want to give out wrong information uh here we go
[1:15:22.820 --> 1:15:24.100]  oh they just pulled it
[1:15:26.580 --> 1:15:31.860]  they just pulled the articles he just changed it since friday he said two of my articles up
[1:15:32.420 --> 1:15:34.500]  but i guess bill neberg is over now he had a
[1:15:37.060 --> 1:15:42.580]  if you want to see a screenshot of it you can go to uh info wars dot com and prison planet dot
[1:15:42.580 --> 1:15:47.620]  com and i shot a video this weekend that erin dyke's edited a great job on burning the midnight
[1:15:47.620 --> 1:15:52.340]  oil titled alex jones bill de berg group running scared we have a screenshot of it but i believe
[1:15:52.340 --> 1:15:57.620]  it said in spanish uh no to the bill de berg group or no to world government no no to the new world
[1:15:57.620 --> 1:16:06.580]  order what did it say oh yeah we have the sign now it says stop the new world order uh another
[1:16:06.580 --> 1:16:11.540]  sign says no to the new world order stop bill de berg assassin so there's a whole bunch of signs
[1:16:11.540 --> 1:16:16.580]  but i mean specifically the sign they had up on drudge doesn't matter pointless factoid
[1:16:17.460 --> 1:16:23.060]  it's just that drudge had that up on his side it's over you can't tell us there's no international
[1:16:23.060 --> 1:16:28.660]  bankers selling derivatives destroy our economy we have the goldman sacks emails we have them
[1:16:29.220 --> 1:16:34.420]  but more than that the public all heard me seven eight years ago calling out goldman sacks selling
[1:16:34.420 --> 1:16:41.700]  the derivatives i mean it's over okay we have total credibility and that twit chris matthews is
[1:16:41.700 --> 1:16:47.780]  going to have some distorted hit piece on the 16th what coming up in uh like eight days nine days
[1:16:48.340 --> 1:16:53.700]  you know demonizing rand paul and myself rand paul's poll numbers went up when you said he was
[1:16:53.700 --> 1:16:59.140]  a racist wearing nazi underwear everyone knows you're full of baloney you get up there and say i
[1:16:59.140 --> 1:17:05.300]  don't want government health care because i'm a racist what that's asinine good keep it up more

[1:17:10.100 --> 1:17:15.380]  to restrict free speech now they're panicking uh rudy in north carolina than eric tim and others

[1:18:00.900 --> 1:18:07.380]  fox said that uh other other communities will not be able to use our um helicopters won't be able
[1:18:07.380 --> 1:18:13.780]  to use the crime units on facilities or anything like that also alex if people go to the october
[1:18:13.780 --> 1:18:20.180]  2009 issue of popular science page 34 at the bottom of the page you'll see that general
[1:18:20.180 --> 1:18:26.180]  electric are making refrigerators microwaves and everything that's being tested in kentucky
[1:18:26.180 --> 1:18:30.820]  that the government will be able to shut down all your policies so it's in writing so if they go
[1:18:30.820 --> 1:18:38.100]  to the library look at popular science 2009 october page 34 at the bottom it'll be verified well
[1:18:38.100 --> 1:18:43.460]  do me a favor uh will you photocopy that and send it to me or or or email me the actual day because
[1:18:43.460 --> 1:18:48.980]  that's useful but i'm telling you i have no exaggeration over 15 years on air i have seen
[1:18:48.980 --> 1:18:53.300]  more than a hundred government documents and news articles i saw one last week
[1:18:53.300 --> 1:18:58.500]  where all new refrigerators by law all washing machines everything they're phasing it in just
[1:18:58.500 --> 1:19:02.420]  like they can tell you what type of light bulb what type of toilet that's just at the precedent
[1:19:02.420 --> 1:19:08.580]  everything will be remote controlled and get this through the power because they can now send
[1:19:08.580 --> 1:19:16.260]  commands uh it's called data over transmission line through the power cord and and and i have
[1:19:16.260 --> 1:19:22.820]  i would guess that report talks about that the power cord has a switch in it that recognizes
[1:19:22.820 --> 1:19:28.900]  data and so everything is going to surveil you and already the the power already the power boxes
[1:19:28.900 --> 1:19:33.540]  are doing it already all the new big air conditioners i mean all of them are coming out with remote
[1:19:33.540 --> 1:19:44.500]  control uh the compressors i mean is this not crazy rudy rudy you gone i know he hung up a

[1:29:19.620 --> 1:29:24.340]  that they can't even control their own speculators and that europe is fully imploding is endangering
[1:29:24.340 --> 1:29:32.100]  their whole apple cart because we're there exposing them so you think stuff's bad now folks

[1:31:04.900 --> 1:31:09.220]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[1:31:09.220 --> 1:31:14.260]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[1:31:14.260 --> 1:31:19.860]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[1:31:19.860 --> 1:31:24.980]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[1:31:24.980 --> 1:31:30.260]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[1:31:30.260 --> 1:31:34.900]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[1:31:34.900 --> 1:31:40.260]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[1:31:40.260 --> 1:31:44.660]  peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science

[1:33:30.020 --> 1:33:35.220]  maiden voyage from england co-hosting the show i'm going to throw him in the deep end and let
[1:33:35.220 --> 1:33:42.420]  him do the last hour live by himself of course watson is a veteran news reporter for a decade
[1:33:42.420 --> 1:33:47.540]  and been a guest on countless syndicated radio broadcasts so including this one so it's not
[1:33:47.540 --> 1:33:52.740]  really throwing him in the deep end but but i do want to see what he does by himself covering news
[1:33:52.740 --> 1:33:56.420]  and i've really given him no guidance we'll see what he thinks is important what he covers
[1:33:56.420 --> 1:34:02.020]  what he goes over and he may even take some calls now i also want to continue with open
[1:34:02.020 --> 1:34:10.260]  phones today in this hour and the next ahead of his red coat excellency coming on in the
[1:34:10.260 --> 1:34:16.980]  last hour today and we do have people popping in also from bill berg 2010 like paul doran new
[1:34:16.980 --> 1:34:21.620]  coming up here in just a few minutes uh because uh there are last reports were on friday we got
[1:34:21.620 --> 1:34:27.860]  tucker coming on in a couple days he's flying back today from uh sigis spain side of bill
[1:34:27.860 --> 1:34:33.700]  berg 2010 i've got to say probably the most memorable in history uh i mean they're routed
[1:34:34.340 --> 1:34:38.180]  they said quote we're just about whipped on our global warming takeover our tax
[1:34:38.180 --> 1:34:44.020]  uh the whole world's waking up to them they're in thousands of newspapers now literally hundreds
[1:34:44.020 --> 1:34:50.500]  in spain alone hundreds in germany uh i mean it's just so i don't know how many articles
[1:34:50.500 --> 1:34:56.020]  there i know you google the term bill berg and you put it in different search functions and it's
[1:34:56.020 --> 1:34:58.820]  it's hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of articles that you just see right there on the
[1:34:58.820 --> 1:35:04.260]  surface so there's a complete implosion of their operation the problem is they're going to try to
[1:35:04.260 --> 1:35:09.620]  launch a war with iran as a political distraction and that comes directly from the bill berg grip
[1:35:09.620 --> 1:35:14.660]  sources people say oh well you know what are your sources well in media we can't give you our sources
[1:35:14.660 --> 1:35:19.780]  but they have a lot of secretaries they have a lot of financial planners they have a lot of people
[1:35:19.780 --> 1:35:26.020]  that work with them there's also guests and their senatorial aides and people like that
[1:35:28.020 --> 1:35:32.260]  okay i mean look at the track record of the info tuckers gotten it's gold
[1:35:32.260 --> 1:35:38.500]  jim talkers for real uh look at how many predictions he's made that have happened unfortunately
[1:35:38.500 --> 1:35:44.340]  via the info he got from bill berg we wish that they weren't in power we wish that they didn't
[1:35:44.340 --> 1:35:50.340]  have the not complete control but they're able to steer and twist world events in many cases
[1:35:50.340 --> 1:35:57.140]  the way they want until now they're having more and more failures because you are taking action
[1:35:57.140 --> 1:36:01.140]  and we are revealing them and the people that say we're coops because there's a world government
[1:36:01.140 --> 1:36:06.180]  run by bankers they look like lying coops now the people that say florides good for you or
[1:36:06.180 --> 1:36:10.420]  mercury's good for you or vaccines are good people are now reading the vaccine inserts
[1:36:10.420 --> 1:36:14.980]  and finding out they're being lied to and they could have shows for kids like squid billies
[1:36:14.980 --> 1:36:18.900]  where florides good for you and your toothless hillbillies if you don't drink it that's only
[1:36:18.900 --> 1:36:24.580]  going to wake adults up it's over okay it's over if we just take action yes the globalists are
[1:36:24.580 --> 1:36:28.100]  going to stage terror yes they're going to try to shut down the internet yes they're going to bring
[1:36:28.100 --> 1:36:33.220]  in police states but at least the battle's joined and we know they're not invincible and we've shown
[1:36:33.220 --> 1:36:38.740]  people they're not invincible and if we just take action it's over it's over if you get up off your
[1:36:38.740 --> 1:36:45.460]  butts if we all collectively get off our enormous butts and do something we can change history here
[1:36:45.460 --> 1:36:52.020]  for the better the other alternative is degradation and slavery of a high-tech version we've never
[1:36:52.020 --> 1:37:01.300]  seen before let me tell you it ain't pretty okay now here's the deal gold is up almost $20 today
[1:37:01.300 --> 1:37:06.660]  the bankers about an hour ago tried to drive it down it failed it's at an all-time high today right
[1:37:06.660 --> 1:37:12.580]  now an hour ago they tried to drive it down it's come out in congressional hearings that jp morgan
[1:37:12.580 --> 1:37:16.900]  especially is trying to fix the gold price but they're failing because europe is basically
[1:37:16.900 --> 1:37:22.420]  sold out of gold the reporting their mints are sold out the pawn shops are sold out premiums are
[1:37:22.420 --> 1:37:27.300]  exploding and i wanted to briefly bring ted anderson up before we go to paul dorna new joining us
[1:37:27.300 --> 1:37:32.500]  from romania because ted you've got some other news headlines for us on the economy bloomberg's
[1:37:32.500 --> 1:37:37.700]  reporting with their chart yesterday that made international news that within just a few years
[1:37:37.700 --> 1:37:44.100]  our gdp will be less our gross domestic product everything we make will be less than the debt
[1:37:44.100 --> 1:37:51.220]  so the bankers set up fractional reserve banking so it's physically impossible to ever pay it back
[1:37:51.220 --> 1:37:59.460]  it's made up we either say no to the fraud or we're done for and as long as we get that message
[1:37:59.460 --> 1:38:03.060]  out so people have an alternative we can bring these people down but i want to bring ted anderson
[1:38:03.060 --> 1:38:09.540]  up 31 years in the golden silver business 14 years with minus resources or maybe even longer
[1:38:09.540 --> 1:38:14.660]  and here he is joining us today ted thanks for coming on yeah hey thanks for having me up alex
[1:38:14.660 --> 1:38:19.940]  and the way you said it is exactly right there was a sell-off this morning but all those losses
[1:38:19.940 --> 1:38:24.660]  were erased immediately and now we're about ten dollars away from the all-time peak for gold
[1:38:25.540 --> 1:38:30.180]  in the u.s. dollar i should say it's already the all-time peak in europe yeah it's already in the
[1:38:30.180 --> 1:38:36.820]  all-time peak in europe we've seen 1241 already today and currently right now trading at 1240 10
[1:38:36.820 --> 1:38:42.500]  i mean reuters is writing about it i i seen the article in bloomberg the the uh... the hindu
[1:38:42.500 --> 1:38:49.220]  has a big article in gold and how the uh... how the uh... people in uh... um india india are just
[1:38:49.220 --> 1:38:55.540]  they're buying gold especially jewelry and bars i mean my wholesalers are out there in europe right
[1:38:55.540 --> 1:39:00.340]  now trying to buy uh... frank's and they're trying to buy the british sovereign and they're just not
[1:39:00.340 --> 1:39:05.060]  getting enough material it's really getting tied out there there's and like you said you've been
[1:39:05.060 --> 1:39:09.780]  around for 30 years and so when you're having trouble getting it i mean it's running out everywhere
[1:39:09.780 --> 1:39:14.740]  else it is i i can tell you right now 30 years ago i could have bought bags of junk silver and
[1:39:14.740 --> 1:39:20.100]  silver was running up over 50 dollars an ounce and there was no shortage right now we're sitting
[1:39:20.100 --> 1:39:24.500]  in a position where it's hard to you know you have a hard time buying kruger and some maple leaves i
[1:39:24.500 --> 1:39:28.980]  mean that the kruger and the south african government turned up their production and they're
[1:39:28.980 --> 1:39:34.420]  making it you know it increased 25 percent over the last high and that shows that we have a fixed
[1:39:34.420 --> 1:39:40.820]  market because when you know say in venezuela when they fix the price of milk and they claim
[1:39:40.820 --> 1:39:46.900]  that it's in u.s conversion you know three dollars per gallon but you can't find it anywhere so
[1:39:46.900 --> 1:39:52.180]  there's a black market where it's eight dollars a gallon that's price fixing so they say gold
[1:39:52.180 --> 1:39:56.900]  is one thousand two hundred and thirty nine up nineteen dollars and thirty cents today but in
[1:39:56.900 --> 1:40:03.140]  reality it's sold out and there's giant premiums so the market is showing that gold is really closer
[1:40:03.140 --> 1:40:09.540]  to 1500 dollars an ounce right now but ted anderson being the free market here that he is and the
[1:40:09.540 --> 1:40:15.460]  patriot he bought gold and silver when it was over a hundred dollars lower and he's still
[1:40:15.460 --> 1:40:21.700]  selling it to you but he's almost sold out of everything and then the price will go up so do
[1:40:21.700 --> 1:40:27.220]  not screw around ted explain this to people and give folks today's offer sure i will absolutely
[1:40:27.220 --> 1:40:32.900]  right now the walking liberty half is still at 975 that was the same exact price we talked about
[1:40:32.900 --> 1:40:39.140]  last week the only coin that's edged up a little bit here is that frank and you might my traders
[1:40:39.140 --> 1:40:44.180]  are saying that this coin has to be up in the 270 range and i said no we're not going to do that we
[1:40:44.180 --> 1:40:50.500]  picked them up to 265 but i gotta tell you there's so much pressure on that market right now i'm hoping
[1:40:50.500 --> 1:40:57.060]  i'm hoping to get a good supply of the british sovereign again we've sold just a ton of those
[1:40:57.060 --> 1:41:02.580]  things and the people that bottom are sitting on nice profits now they're you know they really
[1:41:02.580 --> 1:41:06.420]  are sitting with nice and well let's tell folks the coins you do have though ted well the ones that
[1:41:06.420 --> 1:41:10.980]  we have right now is going to be the frank and you get that one with the forecaster a full year
[1:41:10.980 --> 1:41:16.740]  subscription to bob chapman's newsletter at 265 a coin but if somebody wants more than one coin
[1:41:16.740 --> 1:41:21.860]  they can still get the 265 yes they can they can buy as many as they want at this particular time
[1:41:21.860 --> 1:41:26.340]  but i can't say that that's always going to occur because the europeans are the ones that are buying
[1:41:26.340 --> 1:41:32.820]  the gold coins right now and this is a european coin i import them you know i have to deal with
[1:41:32.820 --> 1:41:37.860]  the competition of that market and the premiums are starting to rise just like you said earlier
[1:41:37.860 --> 1:41:43.460]  premiums on us eagles went up by a hundred dollars an ounce here just a couple years ago and hang
[1:41:43.460 --> 1:41:49.540]  pulsing and george bush was calling for you know if you know for uh for the tarp bailout i mean
[1:41:49.540 --> 1:41:54.020]  that's what's going on in europe right now and it's not going to stop in europe it's coming right
[1:41:54.020 --> 1:41:59.220]  back home here to the united states and we're going to have problems just like that and if people haven't
[1:42:00.660 --> 1:42:06.260]  come to their senses and decided to buy gold for their portfolio i don't know how i can help them
[1:42:06.260 --> 1:42:11.700]  i mean alex i just need to tell you that two fifth two hundred and sixty five dollars for frank
[1:42:11.700 --> 1:42:16.820]  is going to look like a really really good price later on because the market is moving away from
[1:42:16.820 --> 1:42:21.140]  that and even though it's at a discounted price today you know you got to realize that people
[1:42:21.140 --> 1:42:26.100]  are sitting at the stock market the bonds if you have an ira put away and you think that you're
[1:42:26.100 --> 1:42:30.660]  going to have something in the future it's under attack the united states dollar is not going to
[1:42:30.660 --> 1:42:36.740]  hold value as the federal reserve system turns on the printing printing presses and cranks out the
[1:42:36.740 --> 1:42:42.980]  debt machine and puts us in such hawk i mean there's just no way that the united states dollar is
[1:42:42.980 --> 1:42:47.940]  going to fare well in that kind of an economy you know that environment ted tell folks about
[1:42:47.940 --> 1:42:53.060]  some of the other coins that you do have in plentiful supply how are you doing on those
[1:42:53.060 --> 1:42:58.420]  silver half dollars the silver half dollars are there you can buy as many as you want right now
[1:42:58.420 --> 1:43:02.660]  i shouldn't say that because i don't know exactly what you know how many people will place orders
[1:43:02.660 --> 1:43:08.660]  on but they are available right now the junk silvers are great buy i was able to reduce the price
[1:43:08.660 --> 1:43:13.300]  on twenty dollar liberties even though the price went up on in the gold market you know almost
[1:43:13.300 --> 1:43:20.020]  a forty point fluctuation today to fifteen hundred and eighteen dollars a piece we have us eagles
[1:43:20.020 --> 1:43:24.260]  i mean that there are many different coins that you can be buying in on and getting some good
[1:43:24.260 --> 1:43:29.860]  quantity in but you know what when this stuff comes from europe and starts landing in the united
[1:43:29.860 --> 1:43:35.620]  states this crisis that we're dealing with it's not going to be pretty alex all this stuff is
[1:43:35.620 --> 1:43:40.260]  going to go up the premiums are going to have to rise because there's such demand right now
[1:43:40.260 --> 1:43:45.540]  now i don't know how to say it any more clearer than that i mean i'm not saying that gold can't
[1:43:45.540 --> 1:43:49.940]  fluctuate in price and be you know right now it's twelve hundred and forty it might reach a point
[1:43:49.940 --> 1:43:54.340]  of twelve hundred and twenty again but we hit that support level of twelve hundred and the
[1:43:54.340 --> 1:43:59.940]  bankers try to push it back down into that eleven hundred and eighty range and they lost that battle
[1:43:59.940 --> 1:44:04.500]  it went shooting up to twelve hundred and forty and this is happening in the summer when it's
[1:44:04.500 --> 1:44:10.980]  normally historically very low eight hundred six eight six two three seven don't procrastinate folks
[1:44:10.980 --> 1:44:17.220]  eight hundred six eight six two two three seven the brokers will be there until later this evening
[1:44:17.940 --> 1:44:22.660]  and ted has had to go up a little bit on the frank still one of the best deals out there
[1:44:22.660 --> 1:44:27.220]  those silver dollars you cannot beat that tell them it's the alex jones radio special
[1:44:27.220 --> 1:44:34.100]  to take advantage of these low prices eight hundred six eight six two two three seven
[1:44:34.740 --> 1:44:38.340]  ted i really want to thank you for coming on with us today yeah hey thanks for having me up
[1:44:39.140 --> 1:44:41.620]  again ladies and gentlemen i hope that you will
[1:44:44.180 --> 1:44:50.580]  understand that global stocks are way down right now that gold is shooting up all over the planet
[1:44:50.580 --> 1:44:57.780]  all-time highs in asia and europe eight hundred six eight six two two three seven and it also
[1:44:57.780 --> 1:45:03.140]  does support the network minus resources owns the gcn radio network so it's a win win win win
[1:45:03.140 --> 1:45:08.900]  win eight hundred six eight six two three seven get into gold and silver today or go to minus
[1:45:08.900 --> 1:45:16.420]  resources dot com eight hundred six eight six two two three seven um all right i apologize for
[1:45:16.420 --> 1:45:22.820]  having him hold while i was ranting talking to ted uh he is paul doranou he uh visited with us a
[1:45:22.820 --> 1:45:29.460]  few years ago in istanbul turkey he's from romanium he shot great video and took great photos that we
[1:45:29.460 --> 1:45:36.020]  used in in-game blueprint for global enslavement of that new world order meeting and i wanted to
[1:45:36.020 --> 1:45:39.540]  get a report from him because he was there saturday and sunday and we're going to get uh
[1:45:40.420 --> 1:45:45.220]  later in the broadcast mark anderson to pop in from american free press once talker gets back
[1:45:45.220 --> 1:45:48.980]  he'll give us any other intel he has to the united states in the next few days give him some time
[1:45:48.980 --> 1:45:55.060]  to rest though but the incredible news is that the bill berger for the first time ever not unanimously
[1:45:55.060 --> 1:45:59.300]  but the majority of them do want to go ahead and have a war against iran as a political diversion
[1:45:59.940 --> 1:46:03.300]  and they want to continue to implode economies and go after our second amendment
[1:46:04.020 --> 1:46:09.620]  but paul doranou just got back to romania and he can also speak to world stocks hit
[1:46:09.620 --> 1:46:15.060]  as hungary is the latest european nation to be fed on by the bankers so paul good to have you
[1:46:15.060 --> 1:46:21.060]  with us hi alex good to be back good to have you here we're going to have you for this segment the
[1:46:21.060 --> 1:46:28.740]  next uh the website's info c o n dot ro info con dot ro incredible photos and videos and research
[1:46:28.740 --> 1:46:36.420]  up on your journal um uh your online journal uh but uh what else did you witness before you uh left
[1:46:37.060 --> 1:46:42.820]  on sunday to go back to romania a b the guardian reported and we got skelton coming on later
[1:46:42.820 --> 1:46:50.660]  uh as well uh the guardian reported uh that they did finally arrest and detain people go ahead
[1:46:52.100 --> 1:46:58.500]  yes alex uh i've heard about um the rest and detaining people um from what i know there are
[1:46:58.500 --> 1:47:04.980]  there were some people some guys that tried to climb on the hills and uh in the forest to try
[1:47:04.980 --> 1:47:11.700]  taking uh closer pictures and i've never managed to see some of those pictures online um i haven't
[1:47:11.700 --> 1:47:16.340]  tried this here you know because last year we have had problems with police in greece we've been
[1:47:16.340 --> 1:47:22.180]  detain detain twice in greece we actually haven't tried to do anything stupid this year but uh
[1:47:23.060 --> 1:47:27.780]  we only say that the uh entrance of the hotel were basically we were able to make
[1:47:27.780 --> 1:47:35.620]  thousands of pictures with uh attendees coming out and coming in to the dolce hotel and among
[1:47:35.620 --> 1:47:43.060]  these people i can uh name for example the head of uh dimer of my age dimer chrysler
[1:47:43.060 --> 1:47:50.580]  company the other zitch or whatever spelled and another another one the chief for airbus
[1:47:50.580 --> 1:47:57.060]  tom anderson this is a tool in my new name that we managed to take pictures of and um i think
[1:47:57.060 --> 1:48:06.580]  you saw the the video in which a guy probably not sure uh who is from a fiat company uh
[1:48:06.580 --> 1:48:16.660]  wave the the right on us so i will not say who's the victor is that the ours or their victory uh i
[1:48:16.660 --> 1:48:23.780]  think you saw that video wow uh what do you think of the bloomberg reporting that okay there is a
[1:48:23.780 --> 1:48:28.100]  big cabal there is a world government i'm going to read over some of this in the next hour and you
[1:48:28.100 --> 1:48:33.140]  can't blame the public for being into conspiracies because it looks like it's real and that the
[1:48:33.140 --> 1:48:38.340]  federal reserve told bloomberg that bernack he wasn't there uh though people reported seeing him
[1:48:38.340 --> 1:48:43.780]  there and i've seen the media lie before in 2008 and say that bernack he wasn't there even though
[1:48:43.780 --> 1:48:50.180]  i saw him with my eyeballs at three feet away as he drove in and we got video and others got photos
[1:48:50.180 --> 1:48:55.140]  of him they lied about obama and hillary being there in 08 but they were there we know that
[1:48:55.940 --> 1:49:00.660]  so uh bill gates tried to lie about it but got caught being there i mean more and more
[1:49:00.660 --> 1:49:05.220]  they're trying to hide the fact that they're attending this yes for certain there were people
[1:49:05.220 --> 1:49:13.460]  that uh they have been reported to be in there even uh right now it gets um but they are not on
[1:49:13.460 --> 1:49:19.460]  the final list uh that we are seeing and they have a website right now and i think they are forced
[1:49:19.460 --> 1:49:25.860]  to you know to go public and try to minimize the uh the use then that you know being a private
[1:49:25.860 --> 1:49:32.500]  meeting uh like it's a private company which is not the fact so uh what they're trying to do is
[1:49:32.500 --> 1:49:38.980]  right now is you know to try to hide hide the presence of some people that uh even i photographed
[1:49:38.980 --> 1:49:44.020]  a couple of people that are not on that list and that's why i was thinking if is this list
[1:49:44.020 --> 1:49:50.660]  genuine or not because the list is certainly not complete well that's another great point that you
[1:49:50.660 --> 1:49:56.020]  bring up um that uh you know some of the people aren't attending this year but you're seeing people
[1:49:56.020 --> 1:50:02.580]  who are who are attending uh that aren't on the list uh and now we're seeing it all over the european
[1:50:02.580 --> 1:50:08.980]  press we're seeing it all over the us press uh and the word from the inside is from skelton
[1:50:08.980 --> 1:50:15.540]  and from tucker is they are dejected uh they know that their carbon tax is in trouble uh they know
[1:50:15.540 --> 1:50:22.180]  that their entire agenda is being revealed yes they're scared uh i can say for certain they are
[1:50:22.180 --> 1:50:29.300]  scared and that's why i was actually wondering if it's our victory or their victory uh and that's
[1:50:29.300 --> 1:50:35.380]  why i think that guy showed us the inside uh for example i was telling the earlier that uh
[1:50:35.380 --> 1:50:44.180]  um uh nest the guy from uh site uh posting as um which i took a photo of him and he didn't
[1:50:44.180 --> 1:50:50.900]  stop thousands of years from the uh participants list and uh well stay there stay there uh we're
[1:50:50.900 --> 1:50:55.620]  going to ask a few more questions in the next segment of paul doran new joining us from romanium

[1:55:28.020 --> 1:55:34.020]  uh going back to paul dorna new finishing up with paul paul we really appreciate your great work there
[1:55:34.020 --> 1:55:38.420]  and the uh information even putting out to the public uh finishing up the point you're saying
[1:55:38.420 --> 1:55:43.620]  you photograph people yourself who were not on the official builderberg list they've been forced
[1:55:43.620 --> 1:55:48.260]  to now start their own builderberg group website uh admitting global government and the rest of it
[1:55:48.260 --> 1:55:52.580]  so they're trying to kind of hide in plain view and you had one other point you wanted to make go
[1:55:52.580 --> 1:56:01.300]  ahead yes um alex i just wanted to bring this up because uh sunday uh there was no media coverage
[1:56:01.300 --> 1:56:07.940]  at all uh compared to the previous days where you had the you know three four five even uh
[1:56:07.940 --> 1:56:14.020]  tv stations doing live broadcast right from there uh sunday sunday there was no press so
[1:56:14.020 --> 1:56:20.740]  basically we were just only a few people there uh doing pictures and taking videos and i'm not
[1:56:20.740 --> 1:56:28.180]  sure what uh what happened but i expect uh builderberg have started to put pressure on the local
[1:56:28.180 --> 1:56:34.100]  media from spain not to broadcast anything well they have something called geo filtering with
[1:56:34.100 --> 1:56:40.500]  videos and articles and i know google's doing it they will not allow any articles that we write
[1:56:40.500 --> 1:56:46.900]  to go through the google news system though all our others are accepted immediately uh and our
[1:56:46.900 --> 1:56:54.100]  video won't list under google news when we talk about bill gates so the name bill gates has a
[1:56:54.100 --> 1:57:01.220]  hold on it but it came out today that bp is paying google and yahoo to block out negative
[1:57:01.220 --> 1:57:06.900]  searches on them uh so we're really getting a 21st century example of censorship they did not
[1:57:06.900 --> 1:57:15.460]  wanted out that bill gates was in attendance exactly um that's my point that they're trying to
[1:57:15.460 --> 1:57:22.340]  you know cover this as much as possible even if the big damage has been done already and i think
[1:57:23.300 --> 1:57:28.420]  that's our victory in the end managed to you know to expose the much much as possible
[1:57:28.420 --> 1:57:33.780]  it whereas other people well in the past didn't care about bill about it they now started to
[1:57:33.780 --> 1:57:39.540]  find out and question it uh even in uh the bill about was exposed in the european parliament
[1:57:39.540 --> 1:57:47.860]  which is a great thing to happen to date oh it's incredible i mean i mean it is not a complete
[1:57:47.860 --> 1:57:54.500]  implosion but a serious blow and if we press the issue it could be a death blow now the
[1:57:54.500 --> 1:57:58.740]  apparatus of world government's already in place so it'll continue to move forward but we are we

[2:08:25.860 --> 2:08:32.980]  friends he is still in spain about to leave belterberg officially ended yesterday but now
[2:08:32.980 --> 2:08:38.340]  we have a reporter on from american free press he's also deputy editor who can recap what happened
[2:08:38.340 --> 2:08:43.380]  friday evening saturday and sunday we got charlie skelton popping in for about 10 minutes at the
[2:08:43.380 --> 2:08:48.660]  bottom of the hour london guardian reporter he reports he's now been detained he was inside
[2:08:48.660 --> 2:08:52.820]  right before they shut the resort down and got the intel that they were really threatened that a lot
[2:08:52.820 --> 2:08:58.660]  of members didn't show up they were particularly scared of yours truly from my bullhorning of them
[2:08:58.660 --> 2:09:05.140]  uh and that they said that well that's why our welfare state is too big we need to make the public
[2:09:05.140 --> 2:09:09.940]  so poor they can't afford to even come to these events see that's why they want to bankrupt
[2:09:09.940 --> 2:09:15.620]  society so you're so poor you're literally starving to death so the belterberg group can fly around
[2:09:15.620 --> 2:09:23.540]  above you in their jet aircraft like their god uh it's in bloomberg it's all over us news it's
[2:09:23.540 --> 2:09:29.140]  all over foreign news i have to say this is the biggest route in belterberg history jim
[2:09:29.140 --> 2:09:33.940]  tucker agreed when he was on friday uh he's already flying back to the u.s he's going to be on for a
[2:09:33.940 --> 2:09:40.660]  full report later in the week our final report on belterberg until next year uh we also uh have the
[2:09:40.660 --> 2:09:47.060]  fact that uh bill gates was there other people were there the news is reporting bloomberg is
[2:09:47.060 --> 2:09:54.740]  reporting that bernacky uh didn't show up but our intel is that he was there i know bernacky
[2:09:54.740 --> 2:10:02.260]  was there in 2006 and 2008 of course chairman of the federal reserve but the bad news is the majority
[2:10:02.260 --> 2:10:07.380]  of them for the first time are greenlighting on attack on iran that doesn't mean it's a hundred
[2:10:07.380 --> 2:10:12.580]  percent but it's all going in that direction and of course tucker in 2002 said the attack won't be
[2:10:12.580 --> 2:10:17.540]  in 02 when the media was saying it would be including the washington post he said donald graham the
[2:10:17.540 --> 2:10:23.300]  publisher was there it's going to be march of 03 he said that over a year before he was correct
[2:10:24.180 --> 2:10:29.380]  and so the fact that iran is greenlighted is very very scary uh to give us the latest developments
[2:10:29.380 --> 2:10:34.260]  and go over those points i just made is mark anderson of american free press dot net mark thanks
[2:10:34.260 --> 2:10:39.780]  for coming on with us uh you're welcome alex uh it's been a very interesting last 24 hours in
[2:10:39.780 --> 2:10:46.660]  particular um the route that you're talking about i believe you mean how they were kind of smoked
[2:10:46.660 --> 2:10:53.700]  out of here in a way um the understanding from talking to the hotel repeatedly uh badgering them
[2:10:53.700 --> 2:10:59.060]  for press conferences badgering them for information not letting up one bit was that uh you couldn't
[2:10:59.060 --> 2:11:04.820]  get in there publicly in the dolce hotel till today at noon well they were gone out of here
[2:11:04.820 --> 2:11:10.420]  yesterday evening and the meeting was really supposed to last until tomorrow morning this morning
[2:11:10.420 --> 2:11:14.020]  traditionally according to my colleague jim tucker they always have their monday breakfast
[2:11:14.020 --> 2:11:18.820]  before they depart i think they were the last man standing the last bill de bergati here was
[2:11:18.820 --> 2:11:24.100]  probably maybe 9 p.m last night and i talked to a lot of them was that at the end avignon
[2:11:25.060 --> 2:11:31.140]  i'm sorry who was the last to leave oh i don't know specifically i just know that it seems that
[2:11:31.140 --> 2:11:37.940]  all the publicity just kind of made them uh turn tail and run a little bit um maybe not in a fleeing
[2:11:37.940 --> 2:11:43.140]  fashion i'm not going to say they fled but i think it just got a little too inhospitable well by
[2:11:43.140 --> 2:11:47.620]  route their entire agenda is in trouble they're now all over the newspapers worldwide the drudge
[2:11:47.620 --> 2:11:53.380]  report every day the bloomberg's going okay there is a global government okay this is suspicious
[2:11:53.380 --> 2:11:59.140]  you know where were you bernacky obama's their puppet that's in the news uh tucker said that they
[2:11:59.140 --> 2:12:04.420]  the bill de berg sources told him that one bill de berg group members said we're about whipped on
[2:12:04.420 --> 2:12:10.740]  climate change taxes uh but their race on the whole is starting world war three well what you
[2:12:10.740 --> 2:12:17.140]  said about iran certainly uh rings pretty true just how close they are to that is very difficult
[2:12:17.140 --> 2:12:24.340]  to say uh bill gates appearance here brought about uh some confirmation that he was here under one
[2:12:24.340 --> 2:12:30.980]  guys but his actual reason for being here was to try and sell uh zapatero the spanish prime minister
[2:12:30.980 --> 2:12:35.940]  who gave the opening address like most nationals do that host the meetings try and sell them on the
[2:12:35.940 --> 2:12:40.980]  green tax but i think otherwise known as the carbon tax and that could drastically drive up
[2:12:40.980 --> 2:12:46.500]  energy costs and lead to this uh impoverishment you were uh referring to in exactly we know
[2:12:46.500 --> 2:12:51.620]  grease it was the first to adopt the green jobs that take two jobs for every new job and and and
[2:12:51.620 --> 2:12:55.860]  even the spanish leaders have said that was the coup de grace that killed their economy
[2:12:56.660 --> 2:13:02.340]  yeah so the steams bill gates used a disingenuous excuse to get here just to generally counsel the
[2:13:02.340 --> 2:13:08.420]  p.m. on the economy but it was specifically about that tax barcelona june 5th saturday
[2:13:08.420 --> 2:13:14.100]  one thousand hanay israeli marchers on the flotilla thing but 200 anti bill de berg marchers joined
[2:13:14.100 --> 2:13:23.780]  them 1200 people in the center of barcelona absolutely amazing um what about jim's intel
[2:13:23.780 --> 2:13:30.660]  because i know you you went with him uh anything else that he said about the fact that uh one of
[2:13:30.660 --> 2:13:36.900]  the bill de berg members said we're about whipped on the carbon tax well i don't know about that
[2:13:36.900 --> 2:13:42.100]  one i i would be less than honest if i could answer that one uh if i tried to answer that
[2:13:42.100 --> 2:13:48.020]  definitively um all i know is gates was here to discuss it but where they went on that i don't
[2:13:48.020 --> 2:13:53.540]  know i think part of the the situation where it seems they really had to rush through their
[2:13:53.540 --> 2:13:58.900]  business and kind of uh uh get out of here you know maybe they left some unfinished business
[2:13:58.900 --> 2:14:04.820]  or some loose ends um at any rate um you know that some other miscellaneous came through their
[2:14:04.820 --> 2:14:10.020]  they they spent just about a cool million on renting the place and for all their executive
[2:14:10.020 --> 2:14:17.620]  chefs every night and all sorts of about 600 600 to 800 uh thousand euro for just their security
[2:14:18.340 --> 2:14:22.500]  supposedly the spanish taxpayers don't have to pick all that up it's reimbursed so that's just
[2:14:22.500 --> 2:14:27.540]  the miscellaneous matters but uh everything's just kind of coming together plank by plank here
[2:14:28.340 --> 2:14:34.500]  but the the real story here and in the brief time we have is is that the the media attention was so
[2:14:34.500 --> 2:14:40.420]  great that um i think they really had to kind of abbreviate everything and and get on out of here
[2:14:40.420 --> 2:14:45.220]  they know they're not welcome it's an inhospitable place perhaps anywhere that they'll go now i think
[2:14:45.220 --> 2:14:50.180]  that the the bottom line is that the news doesn't remain a flash in the pan or doesn't doesn't be
[2:14:50.180 --> 2:14:55.700]  too sporadic but becomes long term sustained coverage of what they're doing and that's a critical
[2:14:55.700 --> 2:15:01.860]  point for independent media and and regular media paul dorna knew of romania brought this up he said
[2:15:01.860 --> 2:15:06.500]  that he's talked to dutch and others that say they've been to the steering committees that
[2:15:06.500 --> 2:15:11.140]  only have 20 30 members of bill berg we know bill berg does have those steering committee
[2:15:11.140 --> 2:15:15.300]  hearings sometimes they have them a trilateral commission meetings the good news is we now
[2:15:15.300 --> 2:15:20.900]  see people going to the to the trilateral meetings the cfr meetings all of the sub meetings
[2:15:22.420 --> 2:15:29.780]  yes yes um that's right and uh the um former former spanish pm spoke to the chicago council
[2:15:29.780 --> 2:15:35.940]  on global affairs uh that i covered and uh he said some things that kind of laid some hints for
[2:15:35.940 --> 2:15:42.420]  for here and that was back in april and he's uh aznar hosé aznar i don't remember his full name
[2:15:43.380 --> 2:15:49.300]  but he had said some things about um that they might have to back off on trying to dictate to
[2:15:49.300 --> 2:15:55.620]  all the european nations every last thread of their existence i think they're sensing that um
[2:15:55.620 --> 2:16:01.380]  that maybe they're going to have to uh soften their soften their steps a little bit but uh it's
[2:16:01.380 --> 2:16:05.940]  hard you know they these people speak in coach you know uh one level for public consumption
[2:16:05.940 --> 2:16:11.220]  then then speak in another level for their own brethren uh so it's really a kind of a translation
[2:16:11.220 --> 2:16:16.420]  job when when these globalists start talking well i noticed that saturday and sunday i saw reports
[2:16:16.420 --> 2:16:22.180]  of more nations support sanctions or blockade on iran so we saw the the drumbeat for war with
[2:16:22.180 --> 2:16:28.660]  iran intensify after bill berg here's one uh out of the canadian news globe and mail
[2:16:28.660 --> 2:16:34.180]  canada wins key fight against bank tax canada has won a key fight in its high profile international
[2:16:34.180 --> 2:16:40.900]  campaign against the global bank tax so so countries have to win fights uh just to have
[2:16:40.900 --> 2:16:45.540]  their sovereignty so canada's won a key fight in its high-profile international campaign against a
[2:16:45.540 --> 2:16:51.940]  global tax as g20 finance minister saturday approved a plan that allows countries to
[2:16:51.940 --> 2:16:59.780]  manage an issue as they see fit isn't it nice that the g20 will allow us to have our own affairs
[2:16:59.780 --> 2:17:05.460]  uh mr anderson yeah that that that's the thing among the spanish citizenry here and among the
[2:17:05.460 --> 2:17:10.180]  shopkeepers that's what they above and beyond the secrecy of bill de berg and what what are
[2:17:10.180 --> 2:17:14.900]  they doing in our country and what's going on they kind of sense this condescension there they are
[2:17:14.900 --> 2:17:20.580]  at the hotel dolce up on the ivory tower hill looking down upon the city you know the metaphor
[2:17:20.580 --> 2:17:26.820]  is unmistakable and and they they sense that there's this this uh uh you know all kind of
[2:17:26.820 --> 2:17:32.820]  papering over of their sovereignty and then to sort of override their local control even the local
[2:17:32.820 --> 2:17:38.100]  governor i'm told by a pretty good source uh spain has like eight provinces one of them is
[2:17:38.100 --> 2:17:43.860]  catalonia where i'm at and that governor or president of this province also was reportedly
[2:17:43.860 --> 2:17:51.300]  at bill de berg and um so this is a local that should be fighting this uh this breach of sovereignty
[2:17:51.300 --> 2:17:56.980]  who instead is going to the meeting disgusting we've only got about two minutes left with
[2:17:56.980 --> 2:18:01.940]  mark anderson of american free press dot net any other key intel that's come out of the meeting
[2:18:02.740 --> 2:18:08.100]  well a lot of a lot of things are still falling into place uh as i say they they kind of turn
[2:18:08.100 --> 2:18:14.020]  tailed and run turned tailed and run a ran rather excuse me uh i think that we're pretty square on
[2:18:14.020 --> 2:18:18.740]  the iran thing being a high priority and they keep trying to say that a country with not a
[2:18:18.740 --> 2:18:25.220]  single operational nuclear weapon is a nuclear threat when other nations israel on up have plenty
[2:18:25.220 --> 2:18:32.180]  uh then you have the economic thing the carbon green tax that could hurt any country and its
[2:18:32.180 --> 2:18:39.060]  consumers and you know right on down the list with their imf as a world treasury uh you know
[2:18:39.060 --> 2:18:43.620]  there's uh there was the big marches all the awareness going on i mentioned the barcelona
[2:18:43.620 --> 2:18:47.540]  what about arrest and and people being detained uh that came out in the guardian that that did
[2:18:47.540 --> 2:18:53.220]  happen on friday and saturday well from what i saw and i gotta say it was a little bit limited
[2:18:53.220 --> 2:18:59.300]  because i was partially in the field partially at headquarters if you will um i didn't see a lot
[2:18:59.300 --> 2:19:04.660]  of that and i didn't hear a lot of it i think it was relatively brief and relatively limited so a
[2:19:04.660 --> 2:19:09.060]  lot more limited than greece where they went hog wild last year yeah these police were pretty
[2:19:09.060 --> 2:19:15.780]  restrained oh uh there is another thing the police union catalonia is registering a fairly major
[2:19:15.780 --> 2:19:20.500]  complaint that you should oppress release they disagree with police being used in this manner
[2:19:20.500 --> 2:19:26.420]  to cover uh an elite group like this this is in the actual press release of the catalonian police
[2:19:26.420 --> 2:19:30.980]  union hold on this is huge news i know you gotta get packed and fly out of there but i may have to
[2:19:30.980 --> 2:19:36.500]  hold you a few minutes this is the police are finally saying yeah plus the whole country's
[2:19:36.500 --> 2:19:41.940]  going bank rubbed that that that we don't want to be protecting these globalists well they might not
[2:19:41.940 --> 2:19:46.820]  have used the word globalist but they said the the way they call it around here is club bilber
[2:19:46.820 --> 2:19:52.340]  that's the common reference in europe and they it's just sort of like we don't believe this sort of
[2:19:52.340 --> 2:19:57.540]  thing is the police's job with so many officers working i'll tell you what mark stay there for
[2:19:57.540 --> 2:20:03.780]  just one minute after we'll also plug the magazine i want to see this global meltdowns massive

[2:24:20.100 --> 2:24:26.820]  anderson's there he says it's in the local sigez news uh in catalonia that the police have filed a
[2:24:26.820 --> 2:24:32.100]  complaint uh flesh that out some more because that's that's big news we need to get an article
[2:24:32.100 --> 2:24:37.620]  out and get that up on the drudge report i don't know the full nature of it it's uh it's in spanish
[2:24:37.620 --> 2:24:43.460]  but the basic thing is the police union of the catalonian region one of seven or eight regions
[2:24:43.460 --> 2:24:49.700]  that comprise spain just said pretty straightforward maybe nothing you know earthshattering that they
[2:24:49.700 --> 2:24:56.180]  just don't think that this is a judicious use of police resources to guard this you know uh
[2:24:56.180 --> 2:25:01.380]  upper-scale group meeting at a hotel yeah why don't they hire their own security for the hotel
[2:25:01.380 --> 2:25:05.940]  and then they call the police if you trespass that you know that that would make sense now wouldn't
[2:25:05.940 --> 2:25:10.980]  it they they kind of usurped the town they block streets they make it difficult for the average
[2:25:10.980 --> 2:25:16.820]  joe and josephine to go have breakfast lunch or dinner uh i finally did this morning nice and
[2:25:16.820 --> 2:25:22.820]  early at eight o'clock to uh see if there was a bill the burger passed out in the corner or
[2:25:22.820 --> 2:25:28.820]  something i kind of did you dig through the trash you know that's the vital goodies yeah i opened
[2:25:28.820 --> 2:25:35.540]  the trash and there was Henry Kissinger i that was my you know his arms sticking out or something i
[2:25:35.540 --> 2:25:42.100]  but no no such macabre luck was upon me but um at any rate you know that's what's going on with the
[2:25:42.100 --> 2:25:48.340]  police they're the union they're not liking it uh they they got out of here the the police actually
[2:25:48.340 --> 2:25:54.820]  relaxed their um security i was told 11 o'clock last night local time was when the last police
[2:25:54.820 --> 2:26:00.180]  security left the plainclothes people of course were there closer to the hotel why the police
[2:26:00.180 --> 2:26:06.260]  guarded the outer perimeter and um it's just you know charlie skelton's been out there he set up
[2:26:06.260 --> 2:26:11.860]  kind of a makeshift press conference to mock the fact or make fun of the fact that the
[2:26:11.860 --> 2:26:17.540]  bill debergs did not hold a press conference despite repeated requests that they do so i mean
[2:26:17.540 --> 2:26:23.380]  they were just jabbed in the eye and and uh with sandbirds and their socks and a pie in their face
[2:26:23.380 --> 2:26:28.900]  and they finally got out of here you know it's um this uh one notable thing before i sign off
[2:26:28.900 --> 2:26:33.940]  alex is that this is the only the second time bill debergs ever met in spain the last time
[2:26:33.940 --> 2:26:39.860]  was 1989 and this is the first time in their entire history that spanish media has done this
[2:26:41.700 --> 2:26:46.980]  well it's incredibly i've seen press reports of a decade ago of national censorship over any
[2:26:46.980 --> 2:26:52.100]  mention of bill deberg they're very strong in spain because it is old world all right i will

[2:38:13.780 --> 2:38:18.900]  heaven's no but that's what you get with a well-fed state they're able to have money to protest
[2:38:18.900 --> 2:38:23.460]  they believe you having any job as a welfare state they believe they own the planet uh and so
[2:38:23.460 --> 2:38:28.180]  their global carbon taxes in trouble they're being routed they're not getting their global tax
[2:38:28.980 --> 2:38:33.220]  a bunch of countries are saying no to the banking tax but they are stealing tens of
[2:38:33.220 --> 2:38:38.180]  trillions and destroying our economy so so they're crushing us they're still winning but at least
[2:38:38.180 --> 2:38:44.020]  we're not in a coma sucking our thumb dreaming about angels while the new old order sucking at
[2:38:44.020 --> 2:38:48.100]  our carotid arteries with our blood spraying all over their face you know they're not having an
[2:38:48.100 --> 2:38:53.780]  orgy in our blood we're at least waking up and trying to pull the succubus vampire off of our
[2:38:53.780 --> 2:38:59.540]  neck charlie skelton london guardian reporter thank you for joining us sir thank you excuse me well
[2:38:59.540 --> 2:39:03.540]  i just pulled the succubus vampire off my neck that's better thank you well i mean you have been
[2:39:03.540 --> 2:39:10.020]  near quite a nest of them hanging upside down by their clawed toes is that what succubes succubi do
[2:39:10.660 --> 2:39:15.700]  yes they do they sit on your chest you know what they do right yeah i've been nearer than
[2:39:15.700 --> 2:39:20.340]  near enough you're a you're a literary man you understand the succubus succubi succubus
[2:39:20.340 --> 2:39:24.660]  uh the male the female of the succubi clan but uh seriously you've been near the uh
[2:39:25.300 --> 2:39:31.300]  the the brain of the new world order beast a lot has happened you have the floor hair skelton
[2:39:32.740 --> 2:39:38.740]  well talking of the uh the brain of the uh of the bill deberg beast um we have just been looking
[2:39:38.740 --> 2:39:44.500]  through our photographs now and we are we're a little bit behind we've had a rather difficult
[2:39:44.500 --> 2:39:51.940]  technical day i would say it's taken me all of today to fail to file uh 10 amazing photographs to
[2:39:51.940 --> 2:39:58.420]  the guardian uh i've got we've got many more uh now you weren't able to get us photos through
[2:39:58.420 --> 2:40:02.660]  sorry i've got no we've just had i honestly i just i don't quite know what's happening i we
[2:40:02.660 --> 2:40:06.340]  feel a little bit hurt today i don't know if anyone else has had technical problems but uh
[2:40:06.340 --> 2:40:11.220]  yeah well let me tell you when i was at bill deberg 2008 they would my phone kept messing up
[2:40:11.220 --> 2:40:16.900]  up and then i called my wife and talked to her and they called her back and said what i had just
[2:40:16.900 --> 2:40:22.100]  talked to her about and it was the bill deberg boys but we had people here that the gps didn't
[2:40:22.100 --> 2:40:27.860]  work they turned up in town and it just suddenly stopped but anyway who knows uh enough uh speculation
[2:40:27.860 --> 2:40:34.820]  let's uh turn to fact and uh we uh were very lucky to have had an extremely brave and resourceful
[2:40:34.820 --> 2:40:44.420]  photographer uh by the pseudonym of kilo sabbord who has been up in the hills and he got so close
[2:40:44.420 --> 2:40:48.980]  to the uh exiting bill deberg as that he said he could hear them speaking he said he could have
[2:40:48.980 --> 2:40:54.340]  reached out and touched the policeman and we have got some pretty extraordinary photographs and
[2:40:54.340 --> 2:40:58.180]  too bad we didn't have a shotgun microphone where you got picked up what they were saying
[2:40:58.740 --> 2:41:03.620]  well the funny thing is it makes a mockery of the any idea that the uh the the security has
[2:41:03.620 --> 2:41:08.260]  anything to do with protection because this is a guy he's never picked up a camera before in his
[2:41:08.260 --> 2:41:14.420]  life they learned a gun you know he's a builder and um he uh he he crept through the undergrowth
[2:41:14.420 --> 2:41:22.100]  and sat there for the best part of 12 hours uh snapping photographs so um yeah he uh it's it's
[2:41:22.100 --> 2:41:28.580]  not about protecting them from from inadvertent commerce terrorists or or some kind of um terrible
[2:41:28.580 --> 2:41:33.300]  terrifying threat of rabble it's about keeping the press away and the people ignorant uh but you
[2:41:33.300 --> 2:41:38.900]  know that and um yeah so we've just been looking at our photographs just literally turn to a photograph
[2:41:38.900 --> 2:41:42.980]  just now and um there in the shadows after a little bit we tweaked a little bit below the
[2:41:42.980 --> 2:41:47.540]  photograph and uh yeah we saw a rather interesting fellow there which i'll tell you about later but
[2:41:47.540 --> 2:41:52.420]  we could tell you some of the names i can't no no tell me now so you got bernacky and they're lying
[2:41:52.420 --> 2:42:00.180]  and saying he wasn't there we haven't got him but we have got uh we've got the nastiest man alive
[2:42:00.180 --> 2:42:06.980]  perhaps we've got mr kissinger oh my gosh i doubt now uh were you a war criminal in spain so uh
[2:42:06.980 --> 2:42:12.740]  brave brave lad to have come come here and and braved uh the professor oh that's right he's
[2:42:12.740 --> 2:42:18.820]  been indicted as a war criminal and hair kissinger scurried in yeah there's been a lot of speculation
[2:42:18.820 --> 2:42:23.700]  that he wouldn't show because you know why would you come to a country that uh has an arrest warrant
[2:42:23.700 --> 2:42:28.260]  out for you for war crimes um which i think is the case i say that i think i'd be told that's the
[2:42:28.260 --> 2:42:33.300]  case i uh that's something no no he you know no no no i don't mean that yeah that happened three years
[2:42:33.300 --> 2:42:39.780]  ago yeah so um uh yeah but he he didn't seem to mind i think he commands a lot more uh security
[2:42:39.780 --> 2:42:45.700]  and power on the average um spanish judge or policeman so uh yeah he's pretty safe uh what
[2:42:45.700 --> 2:42:52.020]  about bill gates did we see mr eugenics i've not but i have seen his uh chief research officer
[2:42:52.020 --> 2:42:58.420]  craig monday uh we've got some lovely photographs of craig uh so if the the microsoft were there
[2:42:58.420 --> 2:43:04.740]  in force this year uh i think i i believe monday goes uh has been before a few times but uh so yeah
[2:43:04.740 --> 2:43:09.060]  anyway so well you know they're whole new that business model is forced inoculations and weather
[2:43:09.060 --> 2:43:14.580]  control and so we know they were there pressing spain to go ahead with the carbon tax right well
[2:43:14.580 --> 2:43:21.860]  okay i'm sorry i said no terrible obviously i mean it's just awful and um i just i was just
[2:43:21.860 --> 2:43:26.740]  thinking to myself extraordinarily strategizing in such such a manner and then in fact you can
[2:43:26.740 --> 2:43:31.780]  yeah we have a we we have the ceo the biggest technology company on television saying he will
[2:43:31.780 --> 2:43:37.380]  control our weather and this is like a bad b movie where you have the crazy guy i'm taking over the
[2:43:37.380 --> 2:43:42.740]  earth i will control the weather what is that story i didn't know i wasn't aware of that i've
[2:43:42.740 --> 2:43:47.860]  i've been oh yeah bill gates has got weather control systems and kim trailing and uh
[2:43:48.660 --> 2:43:52.820]  geoengineerings what they call it i wish they could behave a little bit less like james bond
[2:43:52.820 --> 2:43:58.260]  baddie's i mean this year they were swept in swept into an underground car park because they didn't
[2:43:58.260 --> 2:44:02.340]  want you know the the few of us who are here to photograph the mister i i get really embarrassed
[2:44:02.340 --> 2:44:08.100]  we we keep seeing them sort of huddling down on the floor of limousines and holding holding handbags
[2:44:08.100 --> 2:44:13.460]  and newspapers to their faces and i'm thinking is that what you do if you've just been meeting
[2:44:13.460 --> 2:44:18.500]  in order to try and make a better world i don't think it is i think if i'd just been spending
[2:44:18.500 --> 2:44:23.940]  four days strategizing for the good of mankind i'd sort of be walking out of there thinking hey
[2:44:23.940 --> 2:44:30.420]  i might get a few pats on the back but um yeah no they they crawl out and they slide out and it's
[2:44:30.420 --> 2:44:35.860]  really i get do you know what my overarching emotion of this particular build a bug last was
[2:44:35.860 --> 2:44:41.220]  probably fear uh this has been absolutely embarrassment and i'm just i just find the whole
[2:44:41.220 --> 2:44:46.660]  thing poignant from from the point of view of that i just look at them and i go really come on
[2:44:47.220 --> 2:44:52.740]  that is not really how you behave as an adult well they know they're setting up world government
[2:44:52.740 --> 2:44:56.820]  you're surping liberty and sovereignty so of course they creep around and behave like uh
[2:44:57.380 --> 2:45:02.420]  like like rodent scurrying around in the dark of night uh from the bright lights of publicity
[2:45:02.420 --> 2:45:06.180]  as david Rockefeller said in 91 they couldn't have built this world government with the bright
[2:45:06.180 --> 2:45:11.540]  lights of publicity and so they're like vampires the lights of publicity ignites them so it's
[2:45:11.540 --> 2:45:17.300]  that's why i'm using the vampire metaphor now now mr. skelton uh uh i have the american free
[2:45:17.300 --> 2:45:22.820]  press writer on mark anderson he said that it's in the local spanish news at the police union
[2:45:22.820 --> 2:45:28.180]  of the catalonia state police are filing a complaint about being forced to guard these people
[2:45:28.180 --> 2:45:35.300]  oh yeah and i reported um uh in my last report that uh uh the head of the local police here in
[2:45:35.300 --> 2:45:39.300]  stiches i don't know if i've told you this i got on my brain a little bit muddied after four days
[2:45:39.300 --> 2:45:45.380]  of madness but um they arrested a couple of guys on the hill they took them into the um took them
[2:45:45.380 --> 2:45:50.420]  into the uh police station and the the chief of police stood there and said we admire you we
[2:45:50.420 --> 2:45:55.540]  admire what you're doing i don't like the guys up there and uh yeah i i i think there's not a lot
[2:45:55.540 --> 2:46:01.940]  of sympathy actually um from the average spaniard and i include the police in that um and uh
[2:46:01.940 --> 2:46:08.020]  interestingly i had i had breakfast with one of the chauffeurs uh today uh we were heading out to
[2:46:08.020 --> 2:46:12.100]  have breakfast at the hotel but it was still it was still locked but one of the chauffeurs pulled
[2:46:12.100 --> 2:46:15.620]  up alongside me and i said oh look i was going to go for breakfast and he said oh look we're going
[2:46:15.620 --> 2:46:20.100]  to go over there so uh i went and bought him a cup of coffee and we chatted i didn't actually
[2:46:20.100 --> 2:46:24.660]  tell him i was a reporter but um we got talking and he gave me a couple of interesting things
[2:46:24.660 --> 2:46:29.620]  with the name of the list uh that isn't on the on the name he identified if there's someone that
[2:46:29.620 --> 2:46:36.500]  isn't on eyes of the two slightly varying lists of delegates which um some some powerful spanish
[2:46:36.500 --> 2:46:41.460]  lady called donorist but and there's something or other um and uh he also told us more interestingly
[2:46:41.460 --> 2:46:46.100]  that um he'd been speaking to the police and they he said this was great conviction but
[2:46:46.100 --> 2:46:50.020]  obviously this is third hand from a from a chauffeur so you know take it with however many
[2:46:50.020 --> 2:46:55.220]  grains of salt if you want but he said that the cost of uh the security alone for the conference
[2:46:55.220 --> 2:47:00.740]  was 10 million euros now i don't know if that's the case it's out oh it was a it it was 900
[2:47:00.740 --> 2:47:08.740]  and something million with the g20 last year here in the u.s. really my good nine hundred million
[2:47:08.740 --> 2:47:13.140]  how do you spend 900 million i say that we're hosting the olympics for 13 billion i have a
[2:47:13.140 --> 2:47:17.220]  much it is so yeah i shouldn't ask stupid questions yeah well uh in fact guys i want to
[2:47:17.220 --> 2:47:22.900]  be sure pull that article up it was a 900 million spent on g20 security i believe that's for all
[2:47:22.900 --> 2:47:29.300]  their past meetings the last year but i want to be uh that 900 million number was there uh or
[2:47:29.300 --> 2:47:35.220]  i know was above 90 million yeah because i'm not adding a zero we're going to check that right now
[2:47:35.220 --> 2:47:42.020]  but mr. skelton what else happened uh what else happened uh well we've uh we've been handing out
[2:47:42.020 --> 2:47:45.300]  our t-shirts which has been it's been very positive by the way i'd like to say the main thing that's
[2:47:45.300 --> 2:47:50.020]  happened it's been a really a really warm positive experience but i think everyone has been here
[2:47:50.020 --> 2:47:54.100]  that we had some people that came as a result of your broadcast we've had some people that a few
[2:47:54.100 --> 2:47:58.660]  people that came because of what i wrote last year um some people that have just started reading
[2:47:58.660 --> 2:48:04.180]  about this kind of thing and a lot of young people a lot of very excited interested concerned
[2:48:04.180 --> 2:48:09.780]  people and we just had a really good time and in a sense in a sense like you shouldn't have a good
[2:48:09.780 --> 2:48:15.620]  time at a place like this and last year i had such a ghastly dystopian awful time which had
[2:48:15.620 --> 2:48:20.660]  drove me half mad as i was chased around Athens but this year it's been you know sitting up late
[2:48:20.660 --> 2:48:26.100]  into the night with a bunch of great people talking about things and seeing uh a great
[2:48:26.100 --> 2:48:31.060]  increase in numbers of people who've come from all across the world to this event to bear witness to
[2:48:31.060 --> 2:48:37.460]  it and and most importantly of all a great a huge increase in press i mean genuinely it just
[2:48:37.460 --> 2:48:43.780]  it is properly a breakthrough i'm now speaking to a spanish guy um uh just the other day he'd come
[2:48:43.780 --> 2:48:48.420]  and he was helping us he was helping us translate some leaflets into spanish and uh he was just
[2:48:48.420 --> 2:48:52.580]  saying you know i was speaking to my dad they were talking about it on the he said oh they're
[2:48:52.580 --> 2:48:57.220]  just talking about it now on the radio they're on the main radio stations in spain everyone's
[2:48:57.220 --> 2:49:01.220]  talking about us but the show for us talking to it said yeah everyone's talking about it he said
[2:49:01.220 --> 2:49:04.820]  i don't know is it because the people in the hotel are talking but everyone's talking about
[2:49:04.820 --> 2:49:10.340]  everyone's talking about bill deberg and you just you just feel like everyone's talking about it and
[2:49:10.340 --> 2:49:14.980]  i know well that's it i mean we've gone from being called kooks a decade ago there's no elite
[2:49:14.980 --> 2:49:18.820]  nobody's meeting you even a year and a half ago before you first went thought it was a joke you
[2:49:18.820 --> 2:49:25.620]  said to now i mean it's all over bloomberg new york times drudge report uh people i mean even
[2:49:25.620 --> 2:49:31.300]  bloomberg says yeah it does look like goldman sacks is trying to destroy uh things by design and they
[2:49:31.300 --> 2:49:38.420]  quote our blogs our articles and say it does look it's by design and and so many times i say something
[2:49:38.420 --> 2:49:44.900]  and it's so incredible charlie skelton i can't even believe it i said 900 million excuse me
[2:49:44.900 --> 2:49:54.500]  that's what uh the security uh at the uh pittsburgh pennsylvania cost the toronto globe reports and i
[2:49:54.500 --> 2:50:02.020]  put into the search engine g20 security cost uh one billion dollars is what it's going to cost
[2:50:02.020 --> 2:50:08.180]  says the cost of security for the summit is expected to increase five fold over estimates and reach
[2:50:08.180 --> 2:50:14.900]  one billion that's extraordinary i i do i don't know why i mean why not just ten billion why not
[2:50:14.900 --> 2:50:17.540]  a hundred billion i mean when you're getting what you're making up numbers like that when i just
[2:50:17.540 --> 2:50:23.220]  cruise for a little bit more but i mean you get 20 bankers who are the real presidents the real
[2:50:23.220 --> 2:50:29.140]  rulers they show up they lock down pittsburgh they want you know they lock down whole cities in canada
[2:50:29.140 --> 2:50:37.300]  they bring in 50 000 cops and literally it cost a billion dollars i mean to be fair some a billion
[2:50:37.300 --> 2:50:42.260]  dollars isn't worth what it used to be yeah but i mean that's probably a billion dollars is the
[2:50:42.260 --> 2:50:48.740]  whole budget of the city of austin every year it's just it's just awful charlie stay there i'm i'm

[2:54:13.460 --> 2:54:20.340]  and i mean that by twittering in the post cyber twitter way with the fact that every
[2:54:20.340 --> 2:54:24.980]  intel source we've got says the whole globalist agenda is in trouble it's falling apart that
[2:54:24.980 --> 2:54:29.380]  doesn't mean they're not dominating us they aren't in control of us but the world as abrick
[2:54:29.380 --> 2:54:35.860]  de brzezinski said three weeks ago is now awake to their agenda and and the people are now getting
[2:54:35.860 --> 2:54:40.420]  faith that we can turn the tide against these people and it's that understanding of who the
[2:54:40.420 --> 2:54:45.540]  true elite are that is our salvation against corruption going back to charlie skelton the
[2:54:45.540 --> 2:54:49.860]  time we have left with him and paul watson joining us via video skype uh is coming up
[2:54:49.860 --> 2:54:55.940]  charlie i can only commend you in your journey of awakening uh and so much has happened so much
[2:54:55.940 --> 2:55:01.060]  is going on uh you did report though that there were people being detained and arrested what happened
[2:55:01.060 --> 2:55:07.860]  on that front well i look i have to repeat it was it started a little bit but it just tailed off
[2:55:07.860 --> 2:55:13.540]  and it was everyone who's spoken to and includes the few people that were arrested and the ones
[2:55:13.540 --> 2:55:18.660]  that were tended to be you know 30 yards away from the hotel with a long lens no one had a problem
[2:55:18.660 --> 2:55:22.260]  and then i didn't want one of the things i no one had a big problem one of the things i should say
[2:55:22.260 --> 2:55:27.860]  is that the guys that were arrested and taken to the chief of police who told them that he admired
[2:55:27.860 --> 2:55:31.540]  them you know he looked at their footage and he just handed it back he handed the camera back and
[2:55:31.540 --> 2:55:37.140]  didn't delete his footage you know so that's it's a different it's a different kind of a kind of
[2:55:37.140 --> 2:55:41.700]  experience and you know i'm not i'm not saying that police forces the world over aren't brutal
[2:55:41.700 --> 2:55:48.020]  sometimes but this year we've had a very good and positive experience and with with the police and i
[2:55:48.020 --> 2:55:51.860]  think that is that you know it's hard to pick there's so many different so many different
[2:55:51.860 --> 2:55:57.460]  positives to draw from bill de burg 2010 and one of them and perhaps you can argue the most important
[2:55:57.460 --> 2:56:02.740]  is a good relationship with the police because if that relationship falls over then it all falls over
[2:56:02.740 --> 2:56:10.500]  for us well it certainly does uh other key points i haven't asked other important pieces of intel
[2:56:11.140 --> 2:56:16.420]  can you give us any foreshadowing of what's coming up in your final bill de burg 2010 report for the
[2:56:16.420 --> 2:56:22.660]  guardian yeah i can um apart from some more picture what we've got we've got a game called
[2:56:22.660 --> 2:56:27.940]  which your listeners may enjoy playing called spot the delegate uh because there's a few there that
[2:56:27.940 --> 2:56:31.540]  we do know that but we're not we're not letting on with there is quite a few delegates that we
[2:56:31.540 --> 2:56:37.460]  can recognize from their particular lanyards and and and the bdi's uh that we don't know but we're
[2:56:37.460 --> 2:56:40.900]  we're throwing it open to the world so come on on to the guardian have a look at the
[2:56:40.900 --> 2:56:46.420]  delegate snaps we've got and see if you could know who they are and if you do you probably know
[2:56:46.420 --> 2:56:51.940]  quite a few so you might win this one uh you know get i join the join the game good what's the
[2:56:51.940 --> 2:56:56.980]  headline on that spot spot the bill de burg delegate it's going to be spot the delegate yeah
[2:56:56.980 --> 2:57:00.660]  all right in your block so it's not up yet it's not up yet but it's going up as soon as you get
[2:57:00.660 --> 2:57:06.820]  those emails to the guardian yes the biggest newspaper in europe okay now uh lastly what
[2:57:06.820 --> 2:57:11.460]  about your mock press conference that's a good way to point out how ridiculous this is okay
[2:57:11.460 --> 2:57:15.620]  i'm just going to backtrack very slightly very quickly and say you know he uh
[2:57:15.620 --> 2:57:20.180]  another amazing thing i just looked at the guardian website uh page where it says the most
[2:57:20.180 --> 2:57:27.940]  viewed pages on the website and uh one of my reports about bill de burg was the second most
[2:57:27.940 --> 2:57:34.580]  well-read uh most viewed report on the guardian uh the last 24 hours and that's the whole newspaper
[2:57:34.580 --> 2:57:39.940]  and you know i'm that's just extraordinary to think that that's that amount of traffic at that
[2:57:39.940 --> 2:57:46.020]  amount of forwarding around and it is because the guardian is numero uno it's the number one from
[2:57:46.020 --> 2:57:52.100]  what i've read english paper in europe and england english speaking parents would have to do but uh
[2:57:52.100 --> 2:57:57.780]  yes uh yeah well it's that of the times of london and and and from when i've read the guardian is
[2:57:57.780 --> 2:58:03.780]  it has a bigger readership yeah i mean online certainly and um and you know these days that
[2:58:03.780 --> 2:58:08.980]  perhaps the most important uh place to be but yeah in terms of the press conference we held we
[2:58:08.980 --> 2:58:13.540]  you know we it was a little bit of a stunt but actually it turned into a useful thing we um we
[2:58:13.540 --> 2:58:20.340]  we were staying at a caravan park we set up a uh a press office in our in our hut uh bungalow 19
[2:58:20.340 --> 2:58:24.820]  and um we stood at handing out lanyards and we would start at handing out information and
[2:58:25.540 --> 2:58:30.580]  and and showing photographs of delegates you know if you spot these guys let's know and basically
[2:58:30.580 --> 2:58:35.540]  you know put a background on bill de berg and you know we essentially we're making the point that
[2:58:35.540 --> 2:58:39.460]  i'll tell you what charlie we're back in one minute do do three more minutes where this i want you

[3:01:29.700 --> 3:01:33.140]  they you know if they're not going to handle their press we'll handle it for them and um
[3:01:33.140 --> 3:01:37.940]  but i'd like to say in terms of the good feeling and in terms of the uh positive feeling that people
[3:01:37.940 --> 3:01:41.300]  have drawn from this i'd like to i i thought i'd be from me to tell you all this was what to do
[3:01:41.300 --> 3:01:45.860]  alex but um what i would like them to do if they've ever thought about having a a worth
[3:01:45.860 --> 3:01:50.420]  wild holiday and if they've ever thought about coming to a perfectly extraordinary event and
[3:01:50.420 --> 3:01:56.020]  meeting some amazing people and doing something that's important and sometimes exciting sometimes
[3:01:56.020 --> 3:02:02.420]  frightening but just a significant thing then i would say when you find that when we find out
[3:02:02.420 --> 3:02:08.260]  whoever finds out when bill deberg 2011 comes along and where it is you know find a little bit
[3:02:08.260 --> 3:02:14.260]  of extra cash if you can't go to clubs together send one person come along and join in with

[3:03:35.860 --> 3:03:41.060]  a few hundred thousand telling the rulers of the planet uh that they have gotten their power through
[3:03:41.060 --> 3:03:46.340]  ill-gotten gain and that we are taking our liberty back from these globalists that are using communism
[3:03:46.340 --> 3:03:51.540]  to take control of our lives now going to paul watson who will host the balance of the transmission

[3:04:03.300 --> 3:04:10.740]  new belterberg story um i'm very excited about this one i think it's probably um in terms of
[3:04:11.700 --> 3:04:17.300]  not coming from leaks that journalists have got out of belterberg but directly from belterberg
[3:04:17.300 --> 3:04:24.340]  members themselves i think um it's probably the biggest story certainly of this year and um
[3:04:24.340 --> 3:04:29.620]  it's going to answer a lot of debunkers who have attempted to claim that belterberg has no power
[3:04:29.620 --> 3:04:36.580]  uh and no influence over world events all right so you've got some new breaking news i haven't

[3:06:25.380 --> 3:06:30.660]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[3:06:30.660 --> 3:06:35.300]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[3:06:35.300 --> 3:06:40.660]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and

[3:08:38.900 --> 3:08:47.700]  the show um i'll be sitting in for alex and we've got huge breaking bill deberg news um the debunkers
[3:08:47.700 --> 3:08:54.980]  have been out in the past few days in the london telegraph and on russia today lying and claiming
[3:08:54.980 --> 3:09:02.500]  that bill deberg has no power these 200 or so elitists from the pinnacle of their respective
[3:09:02.500 --> 3:09:09.700]  establishments from academia from the media from government from corporations from the banking
[3:09:09.700 --> 3:09:16.740]  system they say that basically these 200 people get together and they just discuss tiddler inks or
[3:09:16.740 --> 3:09:22.660]  something they just talk about the weather um you have debunkers claiming that bill deberg wields no
[3:09:22.660 --> 3:09:30.580]  power over global affairs well that's been proven completely inaccurate with a new story that's
[3:09:30.580 --> 3:09:37.860]  um going up on prison planet dot com within the next half an hour or so and it's a big
[3:09:37.860 --> 3:09:45.460]  admission from a bill deberg member um on what really happens at bill deberg and exactly how
[3:09:45.460 --> 3:09:53.540]  much power and influence uh the bill deberg group does wield over um current affairs now
[3:09:54.820 --> 3:10:02.820]  this comes from a belgian radio station it's a mainstream belgian radio station and um
[3:10:03.460 --> 3:10:11.860]  they were interviewing former nato secretary and two-time bill deberg attendee willy class
[3:10:11.860 --> 3:10:19.220]  now this guy was a former top minister in belgium um as i said he was nato secretary general from
[3:10:19.220 --> 3:10:27.700]  94 to 95 um and he gave an interview on a mainstream belgium radio station and this was
[3:10:27.700 --> 3:10:34.580]  also reported on by the belgian news website uh zonywin.be and we've got the translation
[3:10:34.580 --> 3:10:41.620]  of the quotes in this article that's coming up on prisonplanet.com and willy class told the
[3:10:41.620 --> 3:10:50.740]  host that bill deberg does indeed decide policy for the coming year that's a translated quote
[3:10:50.740 --> 3:10:58.100]  bill deberg does indeed decide policy for the coming year and he would obviously be in a position
[3:10:58.100 --> 3:11:02.900]  to know because he's been to bill deberg on two separate occasions and he was the eighth secretary
[3:11:02.900 --> 3:11:08.580]  general of nato he was a bigwig um and he was also a top foreign affairs minister for belgium
[3:11:08.580 --> 3:11:15.780]  now why is this important that a current and former nato secretary a current bill deberg
[3:11:15.780 --> 3:11:22.740]  member willy class admits that bill deberg decides global policy well because over the last few days
[3:11:22.740 --> 3:11:30.180]  you've had both the london telegraph um a guy called chip belay who appeared on russia today
[3:11:30.180 --> 3:11:36.420]  and we're going to play that clip in in a minute claim that bill deberg has no power over global
[3:11:36.420 --> 3:11:43.780]  affairs whatsoever and the meeting has no significance at all now we can go through the
[3:11:44.660 --> 3:11:50.740]  leaks that emerge out of bill deberg meetings that have got by journalists there on the scene but
[3:11:51.460 --> 3:11:57.940]  really the the golden nugget is the fact that a bill deberg member admits that they do set global
[3:11:57.940 --> 3:12:07.380]  policy and class said during this radio interview quote at first he said that each bill deberg
[3:12:07.380 --> 3:12:13.540]  guest is given around 10 minutes of talk time in which they compile their presentation to fellow
[3:12:13.540 --> 3:12:19.780]  bill deberg members at the conference and then he said quote the participants are then obviously
[3:12:19.780 --> 3:12:26.180]  considered to use this report in setting their policies in environments which they affect
[3:12:26.180 --> 3:12:33.620]  and that's the direct translation of what he said the participants are considered to use this report
[3:12:33.620 --> 3:12:39.140]  so they use the report that the bill deberg organizers have written up from their 10 minute
[3:12:39.140 --> 3:12:46.580]  speech and then each individual bill deberg member is mandated to enact that policy within
[3:12:46.580 --> 3:12:54.500]  their respective member nation so this undemocratic unelected secretive elite does formulate the
[3:12:54.500 --> 3:13:02.820]  consensus which goes directly to forming policy in major western and worldwide countries now
[3:13:04.100 --> 3:13:10.180]  this was sent to us by a dutch speaking reader who's a belgian and he confirms that translation
[3:13:10.180 --> 3:13:15.300]  is accurate and we've got the translation of his quotes in this article that's coming up
[3:13:16.100 --> 3:13:22.420]  and it represents a solid confirmation of basically everything that we've seen come out of
[3:13:22.420 --> 3:13:30.580]  bill deberg in recent years whereby the leaks of what is to happen in global policy in terms of the
[3:13:30.580 --> 3:13:38.020]  economy the environment war and other sectors of global policy play out over the next 12 months
[3:13:38.020 --> 3:13:47.620]  we documented this many times with the oil prices the 2002 bill deberg meeting which delayed the
[3:13:47.620 --> 3:13:55.060]  invasion of iraq until 2003 and many other areas which we'll go on to explore in detail later
[3:13:56.020 --> 3:14:02.100]  so this is a confirmation from a bill deberg member that the group sets policy in a completely
[3:14:02.100 --> 3:14:10.580]  undemocratic and illegal manner behind closed doors behind a steel ring of security and this
[3:14:10.580 --> 3:14:17.460]  completely confounds the claims of people like chip belay who appeared on russia today a couple
[3:14:17.460 --> 3:14:24.980]  of days ago to claim that the notion that the bill deberg group had any power over global affairs
[3:14:24.980 --> 3:14:32.740]  was a fair retail and myth expounded by mainly racists and anti-semites and we're going to go
[3:14:32.740 --> 3:14:40.180]  to this clip now and then analyze the propaganda in a minute so we play this clip of chip belay on
[3:14:40.180 --> 3:14:45.540]  russia today now and we're joined by chip belay an investigative journalist and skeptic indeed as he
[3:14:45.540 --> 3:14:49.860]  is of the bill deberg conspiracy theorist mr belay evening to you well as we saw that the
[3:14:49.860 --> 3:14:53.460]  gathering has been held in spain this year a country that's of course no stranger to the
[3:14:53.460 --> 3:14:57.780]  tough economic times of late as we just heard in that report even worries it could go the same way
[3:14:57.780 --> 3:15:03.380]  as greece down the financial plughole is that the type of story the type of thing that's going to be
[3:15:03.380 --> 3:15:07.860]  topping the agenda of the bill deberg meeting of the last two days in tonight of course as we heard
[3:15:07.860 --> 3:15:16.420]  the euros trading at a four-year low people have every right to be angry at financial networks and
[3:15:16.420 --> 3:15:20.820]  they have every right to admit to demand accountability but this idea that the bill deberg
[3:15:20.820 --> 3:15:27.460]  group is a secret elite force that controls the world economy and is building a new world order
[3:15:27.460 --> 3:15:34.660]  is a giant pot of spoiled borscht made from rotten beats these claims go back to the late 1700s
[3:15:34.660 --> 3:15:40.580]  there are a lot of malarkey there are 15 or 20 other similar groups that have secret meetings
[3:15:40.580 --> 3:15:45.060]  most meetings between corporate leaders and government officials are secret the press
[3:15:45.060 --> 3:15:51.140]  is not invited to them this is a hoax carried out by people who believe in an elaborate fairytale
[3:15:51.140 --> 3:15:56.020]  about how power is exercised in the world but hang on chip if you were to put your pr
[3:15:56.020 --> 3:16:01.460]  advisers hats on tonight don't you think there's anything remotely sinister about this annual
[3:16:01.460 --> 3:16:06.820]  meeting but no matter that it goes on every year we don't know what's contained in it it's not
[3:16:06.820 --> 3:16:12.340]  really great pr is it to shroud themselves with all this secrecy and tight security is bound to
[3:16:12.340 --> 3:16:19.700]  breed conspiracy theories why is the group so camera shy then well look and you know of course
[3:16:19.700 --> 3:16:24.660]  you're right from a pr perspective it's idiotic to have secret meetings with secret guest lists
[3:16:24.660 --> 3:16:29.860]  and a secret agenda so of course that encourages conspiracy theories but you also have the
[3:16:29.860 --> 3:16:34.180]  trilateral commission you have the council on foreign relations you have the club of rome
[3:16:34.180 --> 3:16:39.780]  you have dozens of dozens of these elite formations and yes they talk over policy
[3:16:39.780 --> 3:16:45.940]  but the organization itself has no power powerful people with huge security apparatus
[3:16:45.940 --> 3:16:51.060]  show up at these hotels and of course they lock down the hotels you know i'm an investigative
[3:16:51.060 --> 3:16:55.540]  reporter i'm annoying i try and sneak into meetings and of course security keeps me out
[3:16:55.540 --> 3:17:02.580]  and this this is a fantastic set of allegations is is a stage play for the reporters but these are
[3:17:02.580 --> 3:17:06.500]  as you just said yourself are powerful people with a lot of world influence surely they're
[3:17:06.500 --> 3:17:10.980]  going to take back to their respective camps some of what they've talked about at said meeting and
[3:17:10.980 --> 3:17:17.140]  that is going to have an effect on the global scene isn't it and then that effect will be
[3:17:17.140 --> 3:17:23.380]  covered by the media of dozens and dozens of nations and and the the the policies that are
[3:17:23.380 --> 3:17:29.860]  formulated don't hold any power within the nation the people who go to the meeting there's only like
[3:17:29.860 --> 3:17:34.580]  two or three people from each country they go back to their country and say hey i heard this at the
[3:17:34.580 --> 3:17:40.340]  builder burner meeting what do you think and the the national assembly or the powerful people say
[3:17:40.340 --> 3:17:45.620]  i think it's a lot of malarkey take it back and shove it someplace so this idea that this is
[3:17:45.620 --> 3:17:53.220]  plot that is carried out to 30 or 40 countries and implemented is baloney how can you be
[3:17:53.220 --> 3:17:58.660]  so sure about what you're saying here because it's such a secretive organizer such as organization
[3:17:58.660 --> 3:18:04.020]  such a secretive group indeed how can you be so sure about that and if it has no influence what's
[3:18:04.020 --> 3:18:11.380]  the point of it all of course these are people have influence and they want to talk about how to
[3:18:11.380 --> 3:18:16.580]  expand their power and we should object to the way powerful and rich people manipulate the world
[3:18:16.580 --> 3:18:22.100]  economy to their benefit i have no problem with that but how am i so sure these same allocations
[3:18:22.100 --> 3:18:28.980]  were made in the late 1790s against the Illuminati then the Freemasons then the Jesuits then the
[3:18:28.980 --> 3:18:35.220]  Jewish bankers in the protocols of the elders of Zion from Russia an apocalyptic conspiracy theory

[3:24:21.780 --> 3:24:30.660]  and you just heard a interview with chip belay on russia today now chip belay is somebody who
[3:24:30.660 --> 3:24:38.020]  makes a career out of quote debunking conspiracy theories he works for a group called the political
[3:24:38.020 --> 3:24:45.220]  research associates who just by coincidence are funded by the ford foundation which is
[3:24:45.940 --> 3:24:54.100]  an attack dog which transnational elitists use on a regular basis to demonize any criticism
[3:24:54.100 --> 3:25:01.380]  of their agenda for a global government as extremist and anti-semitic which is a little
[3:25:01.380 --> 3:25:07.460]  bit rich given the history of henry ford and the ford foundation with funding the nazi war
[3:25:07.460 --> 3:25:14.580]  machine and hitler giving awards to henry ford and now the ford foundation is attacking people
[3:25:14.580 --> 3:25:19.940]  like alex jones and prison planet for saying that the bill de berg group has any power over
[3:25:19.940 --> 3:25:26.900]  world events as an anti-semitic conspiracy theory a little bit rich there from chip belay
[3:25:27.540 --> 3:25:33.380]  but he said in the russia today interview that anyone who believes bill berg has any influence
[3:25:33.380 --> 3:25:40.900]  over world affairs is and is working towards a new world order is quote a lot of malarkey and
[3:25:40.900 --> 3:25:47.780]  a hoax carried out by people who believe in an elaborate fairy tale about how power is executed
[3:25:47.780 --> 3:25:56.180]  in the world well i'm afraid mr chip belay and also ian holling said the london telegraph who
[3:25:56.180 --> 3:26:01.620]  authored an article a couple of days ago uh basically dismissing any notion that bill de
[3:26:01.620 --> 3:26:08.980]  berg has power those two individuals are going to have to get out a very big plate put their words
[3:26:08.980 --> 3:26:15.220]  on it and start eating because the big breaking bill de berg news today is going to go up on
[3:26:15.220 --> 3:26:23.140]  prison planet in the next break and its former nato secretary general admits bill de berg sets
[3:26:23.140 --> 3:26:30.180]  global policy and this is willy class uh two-time bill de berg attendee who told the belgian radio
[3:26:30.180 --> 3:26:36.980]  station that each bill de berg member gives a 10 minute presentation after which a report of that
[3:26:36.980 --> 3:26:43.700]  presentation is um formalized by bill de berg organizers and then bill de berg members in each
[3:26:43.700 --> 3:26:52.420]  individual country are mandated to implement um that policy that consensus on a global scale
[3:26:52.420 --> 3:26:59.860]  so the fact that bill de berg does set policy at its annual secret meetings has now been admitted
[3:26:59.860 --> 3:27:10.260]  by no less than an actual bill de berg member now in the clip you just heard belay contradicts himself
[3:27:10.260 --> 3:27:18.500]  several times um but he basically tries to make out that um bill de berg members take what they've
[3:27:18.500 --> 3:27:25.940]  heard from bill de berg then go back to their host countries um and even if they raise the issues
[3:27:25.940 --> 3:27:32.260]  that were discussed at bill de berg quote more powerful people then tell them to go and shove
[3:27:32.260 --> 3:27:38.740]  it and that's a direct quote from chip belay now that's quite interesting because the prime minister
[3:27:38.740 --> 3:27:45.780]  of spain his secretary general and the queen of spain attended this past weekend's meeting
[3:27:45.780 --> 3:27:53.780]  in sitges just outside barcelona so if according to chip belay that you know more powerful people
[3:27:53.780 --> 3:27:59.700]  than the prime minister and the queen of spain tell them to shove what they heard at bill de berg
[3:27:59.700 --> 3:28:06.420]  then belay is attempting to weave a bigger conspiracy theory than he dismisses us for
[3:28:06.420 --> 3:28:12.740]  supposedly concocting in claiming that bill de berg has power now of course in reality belay
[3:28:12.740 --> 3:28:18.580]  knows that the most powerful people in the world do attend bill de berg and that it is at bill de
[3:28:18.580 --> 3:28:24.420]  berg where that consensus for how global events are going to unfold over the next 12 months is
[3:28:24.420 --> 3:28:30.100]  agreed upon and that's now being admitted by former nato secretary general willy class
[3:28:30.100 --> 3:28:37.860]  for a two-time bill de berg attendee now merely on the face of it the claim that bill de berg
[3:28:37.860 --> 3:28:46.180]  does not have an influence on policy is patently ridiculous um i make the comparison of if you had
[3:28:46.180 --> 3:28:55.780]  200 um mlb officials attending a secret meeting for four days in america um would this have an
[3:28:55.780 --> 3:29:01.860]  impact on the future of baseball if 200 major league baseball officials attended a secret meeting and
[3:29:01.860 --> 3:29:08.660]  talks about baseball i wonder but that that's essentially what burlay and ian holling said of
[3:29:08.660 --> 3:29:14.340]  the london telegraph are trying to convince us of that top ceo's like bill gates of microsoft
[3:29:14.340 --> 3:29:21.300]  and eric schmitt of google top bankers like marcus adgeus of barclays and peter sutherland of
[3:29:21.300 --> 3:29:27.460]  goldman sacks don't meet with national presidents prime ministers big newspaper owners members of
[3:29:27.460 --> 3:29:33.540]  the european parliament um and members of the u.s government to talk about anything important that
[3:29:33.540 --> 3:29:38.500]  they just get together for four days to talk about tiddlywings which is a on the face that completely
[3:29:38.500 --> 3:29:50.340]  absurd and will continue to explore this after the break of the alex jones show
[3:29:51.860 --> 3:30:02.340]  we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[3:33:23.300 --> 3:33:28.580]  upcoming documentary film now before the break we were talking about the debunkers
[3:33:28.580 --> 3:33:36.420]  who have been out in force over the past few days trying to portray bill de berg as this group of
[3:33:36.420 --> 3:33:44.260]  irrelevant old men that have no influence over global policy and we played a clip from russia
[3:33:44.260 --> 3:33:51.700]  today with the fort foundation operative chip belay saying that anyone who claims bill de
[3:33:51.700 --> 3:33:57.620]  berg has any power over modern contemporary events believes in a fairy tale and is also
[3:33:57.620 --> 3:34:04.340]  probably a closet racist now this completely contradicts the latest news that's going to
[3:34:04.340 --> 3:34:09.940]  go up on prismplanet.com shortly with this top nato secretary general and two-time bill
[3:34:09.940 --> 3:34:16.980]  bill de berg attendee willy class former minister for belgium who said that indeed bill de berg
[3:34:16.980 --> 3:34:22.980]  do set global policy that each member gives a speech for 10 minutes a report of that speech
[3:34:22.980 --> 3:34:30.660]  is compiled and then each bill de berg member is mandated to enact those policies in terms of war
[3:34:30.660 --> 3:34:40.580]  the environment oil prices global government in their own host countries now people like bullay
[3:34:40.580 --> 3:34:48.100]  and ian holling said of the telegraph use bluff and slimy semantics to imply that just because no
[3:34:48.100 --> 3:34:56.260]  treaties or laws are signed and sealed at bill de berg that the group itself has no power but
[3:34:56.260 --> 3:35:03.860]  the fact that bill de berg does set the agenda sets the global consensus from a whole gamut of
[3:35:03.860 --> 3:35:09.620]  policy areas as i said from oil to the environment to the economy is not only being
[3:35:09.620 --> 3:35:18.180]  confirmed by willy class as i just mentioned but in march of last year no less than etienne davignon
[3:35:18.180 --> 3:35:26.820]  the chairman of the bill de berg group said in an interview with the eu observer now in a separate
[3:35:26.820 --> 3:35:32.180]  interview he told the bbc that we have no power over global events we don't set policy but he was
[3:35:32.180 --> 3:35:40.340]  caught out in an interview with the eu observer in which he said that um the bill de berg group
[3:35:40.340 --> 3:35:49.620]  quote helped create the euro in the 1990s now we know that the foundation for the eu and ultimately
[3:35:49.620 --> 3:35:57.940]  the euro single currency were initially laid out by bill de berg in the mid fifties and wiki leaks
[3:35:57.940 --> 3:36:05.940]  got the documents and these were also acquired by the bbc um from the 1955 meeting the bill de
[3:36:05.940 --> 3:36:12.580]  berg meeting which took place in west germany in which um bill de berg members talk about the
[3:36:12.580 --> 3:36:20.740]  agenda for a european common market and a single european currency now bear in mind that the euro
[3:36:20.740 --> 3:36:30.900]  itself was not even discussed by the european union until 1992 with the maastricht treaty so
[3:36:30.900 --> 3:36:37.380]  debonkers could claim that you know that the idea of a continental european system of trade was
[3:36:37.380 --> 3:36:43.780]  floating around in the mid fifties which it was but to claim that um the bill de berg group
[3:36:43.780 --> 3:36:51.620]  um simply by means of it being a contemporary political idea uh in the fifties decided to
[3:36:51.620 --> 3:37:00.260]  pursue the euro is completely incorrect because the euro did not start being included in policy
[3:37:00.260 --> 3:37:08.100]  debates until the early nineties the 1992 maastricht treaty and then it was only implemented
[3:37:08.100 --> 3:37:14.900]  about eight years later so we've got nato secretary generals we've got the very chairman of the
[3:37:14.900 --> 3:37:21.220]  bill de berg group etienne davignon saying that we do craft policy we do send our members back
[3:37:21.220 --> 3:37:29.780]  to their nation states and they create major areas of um continental unions like the european union
[3:37:29.780 --> 3:37:42.260]  and um like the euro single currency itself now these 1955 documents detail um explicit plans to
[3:37:44.100 --> 3:37:53.060]  create not only a euro single currency um they also detail the fact that it could only be created
[3:37:53.060 --> 3:38:00.420]  after um the central political authority of the european union is in place which is what happened
[3:38:01.220 --> 3:38:07.060]  with the treaty of rome which was signed in 1957 so the bill de berg made it clear in their own
[3:38:07.060 --> 3:38:14.020]  documents and this was a year after bill de berg was founded in 1955 that they wanted a european
[3:38:14.020 --> 3:38:20.980]  union and on top of that they wanted a euro single currency that's bill de berg creating policy
[3:38:20.980 --> 3:38:27.860]  that's bill de berg having a direct influence over world events and of course it's not only
[3:38:27.860 --> 3:38:34.660]  with europe that bill de berg have had a major input and a major impact on crafting policy that
[3:38:34.660 --> 3:38:40.900]  we see unfold um in the short term over the next 12 months which is what routinely happens and then
[3:38:41.780 --> 3:38:50.820]  a decades long agenda which is how the european union and the EU unfolded um in 2002 bill de berg
[3:38:50.820 --> 3:38:57.860]  meeting which took place in france um you'll remember at the time that the invasion of iraq was
[3:38:57.860 --> 3:39:04.740]  basically a certainty and that everybody thought um that the attack would take place that summer
[3:39:05.620 --> 3:39:14.580]  in 2002 now jim tocker got his sources in the 2002 bill de berg meeting to leak the information
[3:39:14.580 --> 3:39:22.420]  that bill de berg had expressed their desire for the attack on iran to be delayed until march of the
[3:39:22.420 --> 3:39:29.780]  following year 2003 which is exactly what happened another example of bill de berg setting the policy
[3:39:29.780 --> 3:39:39.460]  and then it playing out in the real world within 12 months in addition 2006 bill de berg meeting
[3:39:39.460 --> 3:39:47.860]  which is the one that alex jones attended in ottawa canada we got it out of uh from our sources
[3:39:47.860 --> 3:39:54.100]  within bill de berg that the us housing market would be allowed to uh inflate into a bubble
[3:39:54.100 --> 3:40:01.220]  before it was cruelly popped and that's exactly what transpired um in the 18 months after that
[3:40:01.220 --> 3:40:10.580]  meeting in 2006 likewise 2008 bill de berg meeting in shantilly virginia we learned that bill de
[3:40:10.580 --> 3:40:16.340]  berg was setting the stage for a financial calamity that they were preparing for a major economic
[3:40:16.340 --> 3:40:21.780]  collapse and we reported it at the time at prisonplanet.com and you can go back in the archives
[3:40:21.780 --> 3:40:30.260]  and see those reports and they said that basically there was going to be a worldwide financial
[3:40:30.260 --> 3:40:36.820]  implosion and the elitists took this as a message to reposition their assets get out of the market
[3:40:37.620 --> 3:40:45.860]  and lo and behold a few months later in 2008 september layman brothers collapsed and it marks
[3:40:45.860 --> 3:40:53.380]  the beginning of the economic recession which is now threatening to double dip and turn into an
[3:40:53.380 --> 3:40:58.180]  economic depression with the collapse of the euro which is obviously what bill de berg have been
[3:40:58.180 --> 3:41:07.460]  talking about um at their meeting just outside barcelona now not only do bill de berg have a
[3:41:07.460 --> 3:41:12.660]  direct input on crafting the policy of the nation states that the members represent
[3:41:13.780 --> 3:41:22.740]  but they habitually flex their muscles in selecting not only prime ministers and presidents
[3:41:22.740 --> 3:41:29.060]  obviously bill clinton and tony player tony blair are two of the primary examples of that
[3:41:29.700 --> 3:41:37.540]  but also even down to the level of running mates um barack obama's running mate and obviously now
[3:41:37.540 --> 3:41:47.140]  the vice president joe bedan was selected by bill de berg luminary james a johnson shortly before
[3:41:47.140 --> 3:41:56.820]  obama took office likewise john kerry at the time when john kerry was about to announce
[3:41:57.940 --> 3:42:03.060]  that he was running for president in 2004 of course that that was a stage skull and bones
[3:42:03.060 --> 3:42:12.980]  election between kerry and bush it was widely expected that dick gethar would secure the position
[3:42:12.980 --> 3:42:19.780]  of kerry's running mate and indeed the new york post reported at the time that um dick gethar
[3:42:19.780 --> 3:42:26.500]  have been chosen to be kerry's number two and that stickers were being placed on the campaign
[3:42:26.500 --> 3:42:35.060]  vehicles for john kerry um right up until the last minute which is when the 2004 bill de berg
[3:42:35.060 --> 3:42:44.580]  conference took place in stressor italy at which john edwards gave a glowing speech about global
[3:42:44.580 --> 3:42:51.540]  government and how we need a new world order and the bill de berg members even broke house rules
[3:42:51.540 --> 3:42:58.580]  to rise to their feet and applaud kerry for this big speech on how we all need to centralize the
[3:42:58.580 --> 3:43:05.220]  world into a authoritarian global government as a result of that despite the fact that the
[3:43:05.220 --> 3:43:13.220]  stickers were already being placed on the campaign vehicles for kerry gethar it was
[3:43:13.220 --> 3:43:20.100]  subsequently announced and united press international reported on this they said that edwards was the
[3:43:20.100 --> 3:43:27.860]  surprise choice and that his selection was solely down to the fact that he gave this uh glowing
[3:43:27.860 --> 3:43:34.980]  speech at bill de berg so again another example of how bill de berg acts in a kingmaker capacity
[3:43:35.540 --> 3:43:42.180]  and directly selects not only presidential candidates but even their running mates which
[3:43:42.180 --> 3:43:49.140]  is what happened in 2004 with john kerry again completely contradicts the notion that people
[3:43:49.140 --> 3:43:56.100]  who believe bill de berg have power believe in fairy tales complete bunkham as we've seen from
[3:43:56.100 --> 3:44:07.220]  chip belay and yin holling said of the telegraph um 2008 pedro santana lopez and hosey socrates
[3:44:07.220 --> 3:44:16.260]  portuguese ministers attended the 2004 meeting also in italy it was reported on in 2008 by a
[3:44:16.260 --> 3:44:25.060]  portuguese newspaper both of them went on to become prime minister of portugal both after
[3:44:25.060 --> 3:44:32.100]  attending a meeting at bill de berg now that's not to say that everybody in political office
[3:44:32.100 --> 3:44:37.860]  who attends bill de berg is going to go on and become prime minister they have to acquiesce
[3:44:37.860 --> 3:44:44.900]  they have to appease what globalists what the bill de berg steering committee rockefeller
[3:44:44.900 --> 3:44:50.820]  brazinski davignon they have to like what they hear from these potential prime ministers and
[3:44:50.820 --> 3:44:58.260]  presidents if they are to be selected um rick perry attended a bill de berg meeting
[3:44:59.460 --> 3:45:06.020]  several years ago and he came away from it saying that you know basically it was a waste of time
[3:45:06.020 --> 3:45:13.860]  and obviously whatever perry said the globalists weren't impressed about how far he was willing
[3:45:13.860 --> 3:45:21.940]  to go in pursuit of world government so um don't expect perry to become president anytime soon but
[3:45:21.940 --> 3:45:26.900]  if bill de berg steering committee members rockefeller brazinski davignon etc if they like
[3:45:26.900 --> 3:45:34.740]  what they hear then these candidates often go on to be selected for political office not
[3:45:34.740 --> 3:45:41.460]  elected by the people another example of how bill de berg is anti-democratic and authoritarian
[3:45:41.460 --> 3:45:49.060]  and does set policy as has now been admitted by a bill de berg member and former NATO secretary
[3:45:49.060 --> 3:45:55.540]  general willy class along with etienne davignon who said that bill de berg um created the euro
[3:45:57.060 --> 3:46:03.700]  now not only is it in selecting political candidates and steering the economic policy
[3:46:03.700 --> 3:46:10.980]  of the globe bill de berg has um its hand in the cookie jar so to speak the classic example is oil
[3:46:10.980 --> 3:46:21.140]  prices um before oil went up to 150 dollars a barrel which occurred in 2008 bear in mind
[3:46:21.140 --> 3:46:29.860]  that a few years previously it was down at 30 odd dollars a barrel in 2008 it went up to 150 which
[3:46:29.860 --> 3:46:37.220]  is exactly what kissinger and rockefeller and the bill de berg members called for during the 2005
[3:46:37.220 --> 3:46:43.060]  bill de berg meeting which took place in germany so they called for oil prices to be accelerated
[3:46:43.060 --> 3:46:52.580]  rapidly which is exactly what happened in 2008 and then after 2008 um bill de berg called for oil
[3:46:52.580 --> 3:47:01.380]  prices to be depressed once again um to go down which is exactly what happened after 2008 when
[3:47:01.380 --> 3:47:08.580]  oil sunk to below 50 dollars a barrel again and this is also what lindsay williams um predicted
[3:47:09.300 --> 3:47:15.620]  also you know his sources are in contact with bill de berg members the oil would initially rise
[3:47:15.620 --> 3:47:23.620]  um dramatically to 150 dollars a barrel and uh williams then later appeared on the alex joneshow
[3:47:23.620 --> 3:47:29.700]  and predicted the oil was set to fall back um down to the 50 dollars a barrel level which it did
[3:47:29.700 --> 3:47:42.340]  in 2009 so again another solid concrete example of bill de berg calling for a policy to be enacted
[3:47:43.140 --> 3:47:51.540]  by the members that attend bear in mind that routinely the ceo's of major oil companies
[3:47:51.540 --> 3:47:58.980]  bp dutch royal shell attend bill de berg meetings every year dutch royal shell is represented at
[3:47:58.980 --> 3:48:06.340]  bill de berg they control the capacity at which oil is refined so they can create artificial
[3:48:06.340 --> 3:48:12.580]  scarcity when they want oil prices to go up and they can create an abundance of oil um when they
[3:48:12.580 --> 3:48:19.940]  want oil prices to go down of course also it's impacted by what the dollar's doing in certain
[3:48:19.940 --> 3:48:29.220]  economic conditions but primarily they followed the orders of their bill de berg masters kissing
[3:48:29.220 --> 3:48:34.420]  you wanted the oil prices up they went up kissing you wanted them back down again a couple of years
[3:48:34.420 --> 3:48:42.020]  later and they went down so again another concrete example of bill de berg formulating the policy
[3:48:42.020 --> 3:48:52.180]  communicating it to the invitees who attend the conference and then within 12 months it plays out
[3:48:52.180 --> 3:49:01.300]  in the real world another example of how bill de berg does have power and its members do exercise
[3:49:01.300 --> 3:49:14.980]  it aggressively in their host nations now of course with regard to iran bill de berg all along
[3:49:14.980 --> 3:49:25.620]  has been skeptical of an attack on iran in 2008 they said that it wasn't the right time to launch
[3:49:25.620 --> 3:49:32.500]  military airstrikes on the country and uh this kind of bovish theme has followed in bill de
[3:49:32.500 --> 3:49:37.860]  berg meetings throughout history because they're mainly dominated by the um european socialist
[3:49:37.860 --> 3:49:47.780]  contingent who prefer to get their will government by um little steps rather than massive advances
[3:49:47.780 --> 3:49:55.540]  but for the first time in 2010 according to jim tucker and his sources from inside bill de berg
[3:49:55.540 --> 3:50:05.860]  they now overwhelmingly support an attack on iran in 2010 so i mean we're at the most significant
[3:50:05.860 --> 3:50:10.260]  danger of that happening now over the last 12 months because history has shown us that
[3:50:10.260 --> 3:50:17.060]  if bill de berg calls for something they usually get it and it's happened with many different
[3:50:17.060 --> 3:50:23.540]  policy areas before and one can only hope that it doesn't happen again but according to tucker now
[3:50:23.540 --> 3:50:31.380]  the majority of bill de berg members want the attack on iran so you know watch out but as we
[3:50:31.380 --> 3:50:37.060]  can see from what i've just documented in the list that i've just provided of uh concrete
[3:50:37.060 --> 3:50:44.020]  examples of bill de berg having a direct impact on global policy people like belay and hollingshead
[3:50:44.020 --> 3:50:50.180]  have been proven completely wrong in their claims that bill de berg has no influence whatsoever
[3:50:50.180 --> 3:50:59.940]  so we've got what needs to be done
[3:51:02.500 --> 3:51:07.700]  don't answer it if fear strikes your heart when the phone rings knowing it may be another bill

[3:52:04.500 --> 3:52:11.460]  draw their line in the sand what have we got a republic or a monarchy a republic is based on a

[3:54:17.700 --> 3:54:25.220]  exposed they want americans disarmed destitute and disengaged from caring about who is really
[3:54:25.220 --> 3:54:31.460]  running their lives in a completely illegal and undemocratic manner from behind closed doors
[3:54:32.340 --> 3:54:38.740]  now bill the burg and the march towards world government is an open conspiracy it cannot
[3:54:38.740 --> 3:54:46.180]  continue in a veiled form they have to put it out there in the open but in doing so they run the
[3:54:46.180 --> 3:54:53.140]  risk of the resistance to the agenda growing in leaps and bounds um on a regular basis which is
[3:54:53.140 --> 3:54:59.940]  exactly what's happening with the bill de burg group who are experiencing protests in growing
[3:54:59.940 --> 3:55:07.460]  numbers year by year increasing media attention year by year and they're upset about it they're
[3:55:07.460 --> 3:55:13.700]  furious we had the uh conversation overheard by the london guardian journalist charlie skelton
[3:55:13.700 --> 3:55:20.740]  who said that bill de burg um organizers were incensed at the fact that they were bullhorned
[3:55:20.740 --> 3:55:29.540]  in 2006 by alex jones and the protesters still have an income that's a direct quote an income
[3:55:29.540 --> 3:55:36.580]  that enables them to travel to bill de burg meetings on a yearly basis to protest um the
[3:55:36.580 --> 3:55:45.300]  dirty deeds being done behind closed doors um by these globalists who their own bill de burg
[3:55:45.300 --> 3:55:52.660]  members now admit set policy bill de burg sets policy it's admitted it's no longer up for debate
[3:55:52.660 --> 3:55:59.220]  etienne davignon admitted that bill de burg created the euro now nato secretary general former
[3:55:59.220 --> 3:56:05.620]  nato secretary general willy class two-time bill de burg member former um foreign affairs minister
[3:56:05.620 --> 3:56:13.700]  for belgium admits on a belgium radio station bill de burg does set policy they mandate their
[3:56:13.700 --> 3:56:21.460]  members to um follow a report that's compiled from each member's presentation and then to the best
[3:56:21.460 --> 3:56:27.300]  of their ability set it as policy in each of their nations so there's no debate on it anymore
[3:56:27.300 --> 3:56:33.540]  um chip belay ian holing said all these debunkers who have attempted to claim that people who think
[3:56:33.540 --> 3:56:40.580]  that powerful people might get together and scheme in an anti-democratic way to increase their power
[3:56:40.580 --> 3:56:48.180]  are ludi tunes well that's completely being proven inaccurate and these people have a lot
[3:56:48.180 --> 3:56:54.180]  of explaining to do because you can no longer excuse them by using ignorance i mean this stuff's
[3:56:54.180 --> 3:57:00.900]  out in the open um either they're really shoddy researchers or they're being paid to lie um
[3:57:00.900 --> 3:57:07.940]  by the organizations that fund them like the found like the ford foundation that funds um the group
[3:57:07.940 --> 3:57:16.740]  that chip belay works for so we know bill de burg now is an open conspiracy we know that their agenda
[3:57:16.740 --> 3:57:23.220]  is a post industrial revolution they want higher unemployment high taxes they want to implement
[3:57:23.220 --> 3:57:28.740]  fascist or start austerity measures which are coming to the united states within seven years
[3:57:28.740 --> 3:57:35.860]  according to the latest uh gdp to national debt ratio reports which show that the usa is going to be
[3:57:35.860 --> 3:57:44.100]  be in the exactly the same situation as greece um in roughly seven years so will we see the kind
[3:57:44.100 --> 3:57:49.460]  of riots on the streets that we saw in greece and continue to happen around the world um a lot of
[3:57:49.460 --> 3:57:56.820]  people are predicting that we will see that don't forget that um in the 70s in the united kingdom
[3:57:56.820 --> 3:58:04.420]  tax was at 98 percent for people earning over 20 000 so there's going to be a lot of strife to come
[3:58:04.420 --> 3:58:11.700]  and it just remains to be seen um how far they will push this fascist or austerity agenda and how
[3:58:11.700 --> 3:58:18.020]  the american people will react but for sure the globalists are in crisis the american people are
[3:58:18.020 --> 3:58:24.660]  rising in revolt against it and that as alex jones said in his video the other day has the globalist
[3:58:24.660 --> 3:58:31.380]  running scared and patriots should be popping champagne talks recognition of what we've achieved
[3:58:31.380 --> 3:58:41.380]  and the march to freedom in the future
