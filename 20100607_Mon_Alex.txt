[00:00:05.235 --> 00:00:06.556]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.556 --> 00:00:08.317]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.317 --> 00:00:10.078]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.078 --> 00:00:11.659]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:13.220]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.402]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.402 --> 00:00:24.086]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.086 --> 00:00:28.269]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome and thank you so much for joining us on this
[00:00:29.887 --> 00:00:36.229]  Monday, the seventh day of June 2010 transmission.
[00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:43.091]  Every broadcast, in consecutive order, just gets more and more important.
[00:00:43.091 --> 00:00:50.934]  The magnitude of global developments, the good, the bad, and the ugly, are just stunningly off the chart.
[00:00:50.934 --> 00:00:53.275]  The import of it is just amazing.
[00:00:56.459 --> 00:00:58.620]  We've got Paul Dornanew.
[00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.304]  We've got four guests today popping in.
[00:01:03.304 --> 00:01:06.006]  Paul Dornanew in the aftermath of Bilderberg.
[00:01:06.006 --> 00:01:07.347]  He was last on with us Friday.
[00:01:07.347 --> 00:01:10.188]  They still had the Saturday and then the Sunday breakup of the meeting.
[00:01:10.188 --> 00:01:11.429]  Big development since then.
[00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:22.037]  Quite a few arrests and people being detained in Spain, outside of Barcelona, in Sigis, there on the coast, in Catalonia.
[00:01:23.288 --> 00:01:25.009]  He'll be joining us from Romania.
[00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.813]  He can also talk about some of the financial meltdowns happening in Eastern Europe.
[00:01:29.813 --> 00:01:32.495]  He'll be popping in for about 10 minutes.
[00:01:32.495 --> 00:01:36.639]  So each hour we just have a guest popping in for a quick report on Bilderberg.
[00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:41.282]  We'll be covering other news and taking your calls in the large spaces in between.
[00:01:41.282 --> 00:01:45.266]  Mark Anderson of American Free Press, their editor.
[00:01:45.266 --> 00:01:47.768]  He'll be joining us still in
[00:01:50.134 --> 00:01:53.895]  Hispaniola still in Spain.
[00:01:53.895 --> 00:01:57.137]  Insidious.
[00:01:57.137 --> 00:02:00.758]  A lot of key info will be popping in in the middle of the third hour.
[00:02:00.758 --> 00:02:10.402]  And then Charlie Skelton, the London Guardian, will be popping in in the middle of the third hour as well.
[00:02:10.402 --> 00:02:16.824]  And then we're going to have Paul Joseph Watson guest hosting in the last hour.
[00:02:16.824 --> 00:02:18.505]  We're going to take his training wheels off.
[00:02:19.588 --> 00:02:30.872]  And he's going to be giving you a big news breakdown and analysis coming up in the fourth hour today.
[00:02:30.872 --> 00:02:36.193]  While I work on the new Eugenics slash Chemtrail film.
[00:02:36.193 --> 00:02:46.657]  It's not that I don't want to do four hours, it's just that I am putting Watson through his paces to perhaps in the future fill in for an entire broadcast.
[00:02:48.336 --> 00:02:51.697]  I don't think he wants to do the show, though, so he may try to do a bad job.
[00:02:51.697 --> 00:02:53.277]  I'm joking.
[00:02:53.277 --> 00:02:55.718]  Watson's a professional and does a wonderful job.
[00:02:55.718 --> 00:03:06.821]  His research, his political thinking cap, his political, psychological, historical equipment is good, excellent.
[00:03:06.821 --> 00:03:12.103]  And so we look forward to him sitting in in the fourth hour today and tomorrow.
[00:03:14.454 --> 00:03:19.477]  Now, I have some amazing stacks of news and information here in front of me.
[00:03:19.477 --> 00:03:22.399]  World stocks hit by fears over U.S.
[00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:29.243]  job recovery and what's happening in Eastern Europe, namely Hungary.
[00:03:29.243 --> 00:03:31.764]  We have a big stack of Bilderberg Group news here.
[00:03:31.764 --> 00:03:35.207]  Bilderberg 2010, final list of participants.
[00:03:35.207 --> 00:03:37.108]  We have Bloomberg reporting on Bilderberg.
[00:03:38.232 --> 00:03:46.954]  Ben Bernanke is reportedly there, and I've videotaped him myself, and looked into his little beady eyes in 2008, driving in an armored limousine.
[00:03:46.954 --> 00:03:50.775]  So he's reportedly there, but the Federal Reserve says, no, he's not there.
[00:03:50.775 --> 00:03:56.837]  Kind of like them lying about Hillary being there in 2008 or 2006, and we know she was both occasions.
[00:03:56.837 --> 00:03:58.657]  So they're a pack of liars.
[00:03:58.657 --> 00:04:00.358]  They love lying to you.
[00:04:01.713 --> 00:04:06.877]  But it's in Bloomberg, and Bloomberg says, well I guess there is a world government and this isn't really a conspiracy.
[00:04:06.877 --> 00:04:08.078]  Amazing!
[00:04:09.201 --> 00:04:09.902]  Out of Bloomberg.
[00:04:09.902 --> 00:04:23.832]  I mean, such a victory that we can now actually address the real, corrupt, illegitimate rulers instead of talking about their puppets George W. and John McCain and Barack Hussein Obama, a.k.a.
[00:04:23.832 --> 00:04:25.754]  the real name, of course, Barry Sotaro.
[00:04:25.754 --> 00:04:27.435]  See, everything's a lie.
[00:04:27.435 --> 00:04:30.217]  It's a religion of lying, where just everything's a lie.
[00:04:30.217 --> 00:04:36.642]  See, if you're gonna lie, you need to lie about everything, where it's just a tissue of lies, a false reality, a false spectrum of lies.
[00:04:37.142 --> 00:04:48.594]  We've got North Korea news, we've got Israel-Mideast news, we've got oil spill news, war on terror news, Big Brother news.
[00:04:48.594 --> 00:04:59.065]  We've got so much vital news today and it is all coming up on the other side of this quick break and your phone calls.

[00:06:01.158 --> 00:06:06.120]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.121]  What have we got?
[00:06:07.121 --> 00:06:09.562]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:06:09.562 --> 00:06:10.582]  A republic.
[00:06:10.582 --> 00:06:13.223]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:06:13.223 --> 00:06:15.484]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:06:15.484 --> 00:06:17.505]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:06:17.505 --> 00:06:23.067]  So they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children, our education, our money.
[00:06:23.067 --> 00:06:26.729]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:06:27.091 --> 00:06:30.792]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:06:30.792 --> 00:06:32.052]  You're being warned!
[00:06:32.052 --> 00:06:33.093]  We have the facts.
[00:06:33.093 --> 00:06:34.253]  We have the Constitution.
[00:06:34.253 --> 00:06:35.153]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:06:35.153 --> 00:06:36.034]  We have common law.
[00:06:36.034 --> 00:06:38.554]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:38.554 --> 00:06:41.515]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me.
[00:06:41.515 --> 00:06:42.435]  Rise of the Republic.
[00:06:42.435 --> 00:06:47.397]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:06:47.397 --> 00:06:48.917]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:06:48.917 --> 00:06:49.977]  Don't Tread on Me.
[00:06:49.977 --> 00:06:51.258]  Order it at InfoWars.com.
[00:06:52.678 --> 00:07:05.041]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:07:05.041 --> 00:07:10.382]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:07:10.382 --> 00:07:12.423]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:07:12.423 --> 00:07:17.204]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:07:17.244 --> 00:07:17.544]  I think?
[00:07:35.362 --> 00:07:35.682]  Good to go!
[00:08:01.784 --> 00:08:07.490]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:24.486]  All right, in the first hour today,
[00:08:28.108 --> 00:08:32.810]  In 30 minutes into the second hour, we're going to have open phones for first-time callers.
[00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:42.054]  So people that never can get in on the lines have a chance to call in and chime in on any of the news I'm about to go over or any news items you wish to discuss.
[00:08:42.054 --> 00:08:43.495]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:43.495 --> 00:08:43.555]  800-259-9231.
[00:08:43.555 --> 00:08:44.075]  And we are live.
[00:08:44.075 --> 00:08:44.495]  It is Monday.
[00:08:53.959 --> 00:08:55.660]  The 7th day of June 2010.
[00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:57.701]  We're nearing the halfway point in 2010.
[00:08:57.701 --> 00:08:59.462]  I just always marvel at how fast time is moving.
[00:09:05.543 --> 00:09:14.169]  Okay, we've got our economy stack, we've got our Bilderberg Group stack, incredible information coming out there, some good news and some bad news.
[00:09:14.169 --> 00:09:27.498]  We also have our Israel and Mideast stack, our Big Brother stack, our War on Terror stack, our oil spill stack, our North Korea stack, and we're going to cover it all, interspersed with your phone calls today, and then we do have
[00:09:28.078 --> 00:09:39.269]  Three guests joining us from Bilderberg in the aftermath of it and the new developments, the things that unfolded Saturday and Sunday, and they are extremely important.
[00:09:39.269 --> 00:09:51.181]  Namely, Tucker told us Friday that for the first time ever, the vast majority of Bilderberg group attendees are green light attack on Iran.
[00:09:52.628 --> 00:10:01.112]  And then I noticed Saturday and Sunday I saw headlines about more nations back sanctions on Iran, more nations back war with Iran.
[00:10:01.112 --> 00:10:07.675]  And what is Iran doing saying, okay, we're going to send armed ships with the next flotilla into Gaza?
[00:10:08.939 --> 00:10:17.622]  And at a primitive level, people are like, good, let them get the aid in, you know, stand up, you know, don't let those armed Israelis go after those innocent boats.
[00:10:17.622 --> 00:10:20.203]  Yeah, but Israel has nuclear weapons.
[00:10:20.203 --> 00:10:26.905]  We don't want to give Israel an excuse to raise tensions or Iran an excuse to raise tensions and end up with a nuclear war.
[00:10:26.905 --> 00:10:29.025]  Come on, folks!
[00:10:29.025 --> 00:10:29.385]  Come on!
[00:10:29.385 --> 00:10:31.966]  You know what's going to happen to the economy?
[00:10:31.966 --> 00:10:35.707]  Bare minimum of tripling in oil prices if they block the Strait of Hormuz.
[00:10:35.707 --> 00:10:37.328]  And that's the minimum Iran's going to do.
[00:10:38.203 --> 00:10:39.484]  You know what that's going to do to the economy?
[00:10:39.484 --> 00:10:44.167]  I mean, at a primitive, macho level, it's like, good!
[00:10:44.167 --> 00:10:46.669]  Kill them Iranians!
[00:10:46.669 --> 00:10:47.950]  Bomb them right now!
[00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:48.430]  Nuke them!
[00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:48.950]  I love it!
[00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:52.573]  Parking lot!
[00:10:52.573 --> 00:10:57.336]  Well, first, you've got to learn how to find Iran on a map before you're allowed to say nuke them.
[00:10:57.336 --> 00:10:59.918]  And then once you've done that, you've got to stop calling them ARABS.
[00:11:01.075 --> 00:11:02.856]  Them towelhead I.A.
[00:11:02.856 --> 00:11:04.316]  rabbers!
[00:11:04.316 --> 00:11:06.738]  First you gotta know they're Persians.
[00:11:06.738 --> 00:11:09.039]  At least know who you're wanting to kill.
[00:11:09.039 --> 00:11:12.540]  And then you've gotta understand what that's gonna do with Russia and China.
[00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:14.401]  Listen, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:14.401 --> 00:11:16.282]  We can have another world war.
[00:11:16.282 --> 00:11:18.143]  We don't want that.
[00:11:18.143 --> 00:11:21.124]  I know some of you are bored and think it'll be entertaining.
[00:11:21.124 --> 00:11:22.325]  It's not gonna be entertaining.
[00:11:22.325 --> 00:11:24.706]  It's not gonna be fun.
[00:11:24.706 --> 00:11:26.666]  You don't want it.
[00:11:26.666 --> 00:11:27.547]  Doesn't need to happen.
[00:11:30.387 --> 00:11:34.611]  Israeli military took control of the Rachel Corey on Friday and erected it in.
[00:11:34.611 --> 00:11:35.752]  Reportedly, there was no violence.
[00:11:35.752 --> 00:11:38.854]  That's the good news.
[00:11:38.854 --> 00:11:45.100]  The bad news is the Israelis killed five scuba divers off the coast of Gaza, claiming they were terrorists.
[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:49.744]  But witnesses reported they looked like they were just off the coast with no targets around them in scuba gear.
[00:11:49.744 --> 00:11:56.190]  So, it's the same commandos that reportedly boarded the ship last Monday.
[00:11:57.901 --> 00:12:00.342]  So another big PR disaster on that front.
[00:12:00.342 --> 00:12:02.563]  That's all coming up.
[00:12:02.563 --> 00:12:05.864]  But let me just get into the economy first here, okay?
[00:12:05.864 --> 00:12:11.146]  At least hit some of these headlines.
[00:12:11.146 --> 00:12:14.287]  World stocks hit by fears over U.S.
[00:12:14.287 --> 00:12:18.009]  jobs and the plunging economy in Hungary.
[00:12:19.329 --> 00:12:24.571]  U.S., a $13 trillion debt poised to overtake GDP.
[00:12:24.571 --> 00:12:25.932]  Bloomberg chart of the day.
[00:12:25.932 --> 00:12:31.354]  That's right, our debt is set to overtake our entire GDP, which is what it's designed to do.
[00:12:31.354 --> 00:12:32.854]  Total slaves of the bankers.
[00:12:32.854 --> 00:12:34.075]  But breaking that down more today.
[00:12:35.576 --> 00:12:41.463]  In five years, UK will be spending more on interest than schools, climate, and transport combined.
[00:12:41.463 --> 00:12:43.566]  Oh, that's out of business, Insider.
[00:12:43.566 --> 00:12:45.248]  Oh, we've got to spend money on the climate!
[00:12:45.248 --> 00:12:46.590]  Yes, saving it!
[00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:49.834]  Give Al Gore money or the Earth will die!
[00:12:49.834 --> 00:12:52.457]  Germany to unveil cuts to welfare and jobs.
[00:12:54.332 --> 00:13:00.738]  See, they raise your taxes in the name of the social welfare net, and then once the bankers get you in debt, they take it all away.
[00:13:00.738 --> 00:13:04.101]  That's what you foolish, low-level leftists don't understand.
[00:13:04.101 --> 00:13:08.345]  The money goes to the bankers, with their trillions in bonuses.
[00:13:08.345 --> 00:13:08.986]  Got it?
[00:13:08.986 --> 00:13:09.526]  Got it?
[00:13:09.526 --> 00:13:10.527]  Understand that?
[00:13:10.527 --> 00:13:12.789]  Big government's for and by the bankers!
[00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:14.451]  Got that?
[00:13:14.451 --> 00:13:22.017]  All you stupid mainline liberals and all you stupid mainline conservatives that are like, corporations never do wrong, they're good.
[00:13:22.017 --> 00:13:25.320]  We need the big insurance companies to run healthcare.
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.522]  We, we, we, the banks are good.
[00:13:27.522 --> 00:13:28.362]  No, they're not.
[00:13:28.362 --> 00:13:29.543]  No, they're not free market.
[00:13:29.543 --> 00:13:31.705]  Just shut up.
[00:13:31.705 --> 00:13:37.410]  All of you are mainline people out there that buy into the mainstream media garbage are fools.
[00:13:39.104 --> 00:13:40.264]  That's the false paradigm.
[00:13:40.264 --> 00:13:44.306]  Europe is heading for a mini-depression, Counterpunch reports.
[00:13:44.306 --> 00:13:47.407]  Counterpunch is some good folks, but no, they're already in a depression, okay?
[00:13:47.407 --> 00:13:48.387]  So are we.
[00:13:48.387 --> 00:13:51.048]  It's not a mini-depression, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:51.048 --> 00:13:56.870]  We have a higher debt ratio in Europe and the United States than they had in the depth of the Great Depression in 1933.
[00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:57.330]  U.S.
[00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:02.972]  will be like Greece in seven to ten years, say congressmen and experts.
[00:14:02.972 --> 00:14:05.293]  Seven to ten years?
[00:14:05.293 --> 00:14:06.293]  How about one year?
[00:14:10.529 --> 00:14:12.490]  College students, this is your future.
[00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:16.171]  High unemployment and student loan hell.
[00:14:16.171 --> 00:14:20.793]  We've got Gerald Cilente coming on either Tuesday or Wednesday to break that down.
[00:14:20.793 --> 00:14:23.774]  For-profit colleges reap big benefit from stimulus.
[00:14:23.774 --> 00:14:25.854]  Yeah, they're getting the government money.
[00:14:25.854 --> 00:14:26.735]  And then you don't.
[00:14:26.735 --> 00:14:30.156]  Most people are getting these degrees and being $100,000 plus in debt.
[00:14:34.471 --> 00:14:37.212]  Unless you're getting a government job, you're not getting one.
[00:14:37.212 --> 00:14:40.793]  Gotta love all the PhDs with 7-Eleven jobs or Walmart jobs.
[00:14:40.793 --> 00:14:43.855]  Of course, 95% of new job hiring is government.
[00:14:43.855 --> 00:14:48.416]  See, it's a takeover!
[00:14:48.416 --> 00:14:50.697]  Rating cut by Finch on wealthiest U.S.
[00:14:50.697 --> 00:14:52.058]  state per capita.
[00:14:52.058 --> 00:14:57.680]  Connecticut is the wealthiest state, kind of the bedroom community for the Wall Street hooligans.
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:02.302]  And they've now lost their AAA rating, just like California is about to lose it.
[00:15:04.005 --> 00:15:08.069]  Then that means you pay higher interest to the bankers with made-up money.
[00:15:08.069 --> 00:15:14.134]  They get the whole world, the whole world in their filthy hands because we won't wake up the scam.
[00:15:14.134 --> 00:15:15.555]  So we're going to be going over some of that.
[00:15:15.555 --> 00:15:18.217]  Also, world stocks again hit by fears over U.S.
[00:15:18.217 --> 00:15:20.299]  job losses and hungry plunging.
[00:15:20.299 --> 00:15:22.781]  We're going to again get back into that coming up a little bit later.
[00:15:24.368 --> 00:15:31.110]  On the Bilderberg front, Sigis Spain, the Bilderberg Group, now has a website, Bilderberg Meetings.
[00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:37.531]  Before, the last four years, they would release a fax.
[00:15:37.531 --> 00:15:42.733]  And they had to do that because of four-year requests to find out what government officials are there.
[00:15:42.733 --> 00:15:44.833]  They just preempt it now.
[00:15:44.833 --> 00:15:46.073]  But they also lie about it.
[00:15:46.073 --> 00:15:52.035]  We've caught them lying about Bernanke being there, Hillary, Barack H. Obama, Barry Sitaro.
[00:15:54.770 --> 00:16:06.514]  And so they released the names, but we already have photographs of some of the people that aren't on this list, so lots of deception there.
[00:16:06.514 --> 00:16:12.596]  But William Gates, Bill Gates, is on the list.
[00:16:12.596 --> 00:16:19.079]  Continuing, Bilderberg wants Americans disarmed and dependent on government.
[00:16:19.773 --> 00:16:27.114]  And then Paul Watson has an excellent article going over Tucker saying that was one of the main things on their agenda is we've got to disarm these slaves.
[00:16:27.114 --> 00:16:33.635]  And then he also then links to all the mainstream news about the UN treaty to basically ban importation of all small arms.
[00:16:33.635 --> 00:16:38.096]  And then the federal government says under that treaty that that supersedes U.S.
[00:16:38.096 --> 00:16:42.557]  law and that they will ban the Second Amendment for citizens.
[00:16:42.557 --> 00:16:43.457]  Big news.
[00:16:43.457 --> 00:16:45.097]  Need to get this out to everybody.
[00:16:45.097 --> 00:16:48.858]  Bilderberg wants Americans disarmed and dependent on government.
[00:16:50.253 --> 00:17:00.738]  And of course, what did Charlie Skelton last week on Wednesday evening, the night before they threw everybody out, he was there.
[00:17:00.738 --> 00:17:16.706]  London Guardian reporter, and he's in the dinner, in there in the hotel, five-star lounge, and right next to him are the head, and I've been thrown out as well twice, so I've seen the badges, and they had the head
[00:17:18.473 --> 00:17:18.833]  We're good to go.
[00:17:42.333 --> 00:17:43.553]  Any job!
[00:17:43.553 --> 00:17:44.514]  Start your own factory?
[00:17:44.514 --> 00:17:46.514]  They're going to allow that with their carbon tax.
[00:17:46.514 --> 00:17:48.435]  If they don't want to, you won't.
[00:17:48.435 --> 00:17:50.695]  They're going to allow you to have a car dealership.
[00:17:50.695 --> 00:17:53.736]  They're going to allow you to have a farmer ranch.
[00:17:53.736 --> 00:17:56.556]  And that, oh my gosh, the protesters are so scary.
[00:17:56.556 --> 00:17:59.017]  Did you see the horrid Alex Jones?
[00:17:59.017 --> 00:18:00.938]  Oh, he's so frightening on his bullhorn.
[00:18:00.938 --> 00:18:02.418]  They were so close.
[00:18:02.418 --> 00:18:03.378]  Did they attack?
[00:18:03.378 --> 00:18:05.659]  No, but it was very frightening.
[00:18:05.659 --> 00:18:06.379]  Oh my gosh.
[00:18:07.446 --> 00:18:12.048]  Of course they want your guns and they want to economically destroy you.
[00:18:12.048 --> 00:18:17.211]  So the good news is a lot of Bilderberg attendees didn't show up.
[00:18:17.211 --> 00:18:18.472]  They're scared.
[00:18:18.472 --> 00:18:22.734]  They go to great lengths to hide their faces because they know they're engaged in criminal activity inside.
[00:18:23.749 --> 00:18:34.235]  Big corporate interests taking control of government and having presidents and prime ministers arrive to be vetted and to pledge their allegiance to these people.
[00:18:34.235 --> 00:18:35.775]  It's against federal law.
[00:18:35.775 --> 00:18:37.156]  The Logan Act.
[00:18:37.156 --> 00:18:38.057]  But the problem is
[00:18:39.244 --> 00:18:45.890]  The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, Bloomberg all had reports about Bilderberg, or at least mentioned them.
[00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:50.814]  Drudge Report ran headlines all week, including two PrisonPlanet.com articles.
[00:18:50.814 --> 00:18:58.100]  There's a PrisonPlanet.com article there right now, right next to two London Guardian reports about Bilderberg.
[00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:01.043]  See, we're mainstream now.
[00:19:01.043 --> 00:19:03.925]  We didn't change, we're changing the system.
[00:19:03.925 --> 00:19:04.646]  We can win!
[00:19:07.691 --> 00:19:22.663]  You know, it's amazing when some bully starts a fight with you and he's a foot and a half taller than you and outweighs you by a hundred pounds, but if you just start pounding him and open a can up and just turn it loose, you're going to be surprised when that guy falls over and hits his head on the concrete.
[00:19:24.224 --> 00:19:29.768]  Then your only problem is explaining to the police that he attacked you first, and thank God there's a witness.
[00:19:29.768 --> 00:19:31.649]  That's the same thing politically.
[00:19:31.649 --> 00:19:39.135]  You start swinging, folks, you turn it loose, you know you at least aren't going to die on your knees, and you're probably going to whoop them.
[00:19:39.135 --> 00:19:42.517]  It's the same thing politically in the peaceful info war.
[00:19:42.517 --> 00:19:44.379]  That doesn't mean we've beaten them.
[00:19:44.379 --> 00:19:45.740]  Doesn't mean that we're not in trouble.
[00:19:46.752 --> 00:19:47.792]  Let me be clear about that.
[00:19:47.792 --> 00:19:49.513]  Some are saying Alex is saying we won.
[00:19:49.513 --> 00:19:50.334]  We haven't won.
[00:19:50.334 --> 00:19:51.314]  Well, that's a straw man.
[00:19:51.314 --> 00:19:52.394]  I never said that.
[00:19:52.394 --> 00:19:56.236]  But what I said is, we're in the fight, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:56.236 --> 00:19:57.517]  And they're scared.
[00:19:57.517 --> 00:19:59.498]  We're going to explain when we come back and go to your phone calls.
[00:19:59.498 --> 00:20:00.178]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:01.860]  Fact.

[00:20:03.221 --> 00:20:05.343]  have hepatitis C due to liver damage.
[00:20:05.343 --> 00:20:05.863]  Fact.
[00:20:05.863 --> 00:20:09.546]  Cirrhosis of the liver is the eighth leading cause of death among Americans.
[00:20:09.546 --> 00:20:10.166]  Fact.
[00:20:10.166 --> 00:20:15.690]  Alcohol, many prescription drugs, food additives, pesticides, and environmental toxins damage the liver.
[00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:16.311]  Fact.
[00:20:16.311 --> 00:20:20.514]  One in ten Americans is or has been affected by liver or gallbladder disease.
[00:20:20.514 --> 00:20:21.094]  Fact.
[00:20:21.094 --> 00:20:24.797]  Anything that keeps the liver from doing its job can put your life in danger.

[00:22:09.825 --> 00:22:12.726]  And now experimenting with viruses.
[00:22:12.726 --> 00:22:13.786]  Viruses.
[00:22:13.786 --> 00:22:19.509]  Without a long-term food solution, you will have just two options.
[00:22:19.509 --> 00:22:21.709]  Starve or surrender.
[00:22:21.709 --> 00:22:22.490]  Surrender.
[00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:26.291]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out.

[00:23:06.112 --> 00:23:06.973]  Don't!
[00:23:06.973 --> 00:23:10.414]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.

[00:23:55.391 --> 00:23:56.652]  Well, gold is up $20 right now.
[00:23:56.652 --> 00:23:57.673]  Power surging.
[00:23:57.673 --> 00:24:04.537]  That's $20 just the last two hours.
[00:24:25.276 --> 00:24:28.397]  It was just up about two hours ago by a dollar.
[00:24:28.397 --> 00:24:31.918]  I went and looked it up and it's 20 bucks right now.
[00:24:31.918 --> 00:24:34.419]  Power surging is the word.
[00:24:34.419 --> 00:24:39.481]  Let me just hit refresh, see how much it's gone up.
[00:24:39.481 --> 00:24:41.262]  Just amazing information.
[00:24:41.262 --> 00:24:45.163]  The globalists will go in and try to push it down, but it's a losing battle obviously.
[00:24:45.163 --> 00:24:48.925]  That's why I've got a mainstream news article here about them proposing a gold tax.
[00:24:50.165 --> 00:24:53.267]  That's the same thing as basically confiscation.
[00:24:53.267 --> 00:24:55.328]  The power to tax is the power to destroy.
[00:24:55.328 --> 00:24:56.169]  But what are you going to do?
[00:24:56.169 --> 00:24:58.630]  Stay in paper that they can tax?
[00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:02.953]  There is no silver super magic bullet, but the best thing is gold and silver.
[00:25:02.953 --> 00:25:11.979]  That's why you've got to get it now, bury it now, your golden eggs before the bankers steal everything, and they will take everything.
[00:25:11.979 --> 00:25:14.601]  People are like, well, what do I get that's perfectly safe?
[00:25:14.601 --> 00:25:15.882]  Nothing's perfectly safe!
[00:25:16.823 --> 00:25:28.068]  The Federal Trade Commission, the FCC, are all announcing that they're going to put taxes on all cell phones, all internet, all alternative news, radio, TV, all advertising.
[00:25:28.068 --> 00:25:29.769]  Control everything you say.
[00:25:29.769 --> 00:25:33.070]  They're openly saying the end of free speech.
[00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:33.470]  Okay?
[00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:35.171]  I mean, it's really happening.
[00:25:35.171 --> 00:25:38.052]  They really took over healthcare.
[00:25:38.052 --> 00:25:42.174]  And they know they're going to phase it in over four years, so Obama says, see, everything's fine.
[00:25:42.174 --> 00:25:43.975]  Yeah, the whole economy's going to hell in a handbasket.
[00:25:43.975 --> 00:25:44.775]  Everything's fine.
[00:25:44.775 --> 00:25:46.076]  You wait until they implement it all.
[00:25:47.731 --> 00:25:52.934]  Cyber security's going in to be able to take over the entire web and shut it off in their own words!
[00:25:52.934 --> 00:25:54.635]  I can't believe they're this bold.
[00:25:54.635 --> 00:25:56.376]  We know what this is.
[00:25:56.376 --> 00:26:00.378]  It starts with a capital T. Tyranny.
[00:26:00.378 --> 00:26:01.359]  Tyranny.
[00:26:01.359 --> 00:26:03.340]  Tyrannus.
[00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:08.903]  The Tyrant.
[00:26:08.903 --> 00:26:13.766]  Well, I say death to the idea of tyranny.
[00:26:13.766 --> 00:26:15.667]  Death to the spirit of tyranny.
[00:26:15.667 --> 00:26:16.708]  Down with tyranny.
[00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:22.893]  The spirit of liberty is rising!
[00:26:22.893 --> 00:26:25.495]  So of course the Bilderberg Group is scared to death.
[00:26:25.495 --> 00:26:26.315]  Of course.
[00:26:26.315 --> 00:26:31.239]  I mean, remember just four or five years ago they were still making fun of you if you talked about the Bilderberg Group.
[00:26:31.239 --> 00:26:35.382]  National talk show hosts were going, can I have some cheese with my Bilderberger?
[00:26:35.382 --> 00:26:38.824]  I mean, I heard that joke for 15 years.
[00:26:38.824 --> 00:26:43.388]  Oh, they're not laughing anymore because we didn't care what the media said about us.
[00:26:43.388 --> 00:26:45.069]  We didn't care about the demonization.
[00:26:46.633 --> 00:26:49.334]  We didn't care about the propaganda.
[00:26:49.334 --> 00:26:53.536]  We didn't care about the New World Order calling us names.
[00:26:53.536 --> 00:26:57.837]  We just covered the facts and said these bankers are issuing derivatives.
[00:26:57.837 --> 00:26:59.638]  It's basically a counterfeit instrument.
[00:26:59.638 --> 00:27:01.298]  They're buying up the world with it.
[00:27:01.298 --> 00:27:04.840]  They're setting up a police state ahead of their implosion of the economy.
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:07.441]  They're going to put brain scanners and naked body scanners in.
[00:27:07.441 --> 00:27:10.822]  By the way, they're announcing naked body scanners and brain scanners to be on the street now.
[00:27:11.482 --> 00:27:14.084]  Just, just, just, oh, where'd Bob go?
[00:27:14.084 --> 00:27:16.246]  Oh, the brain scanner said he was a terrorist.
[00:27:16.246 --> 00:27:18.848]  No judge, no jury.
[00:27:18.848 --> 00:27:24.012]  Warrantless DNA checkpoints, they're going for broke.
[00:27:24.012 --> 00:27:26.454]  Because they don't have much time.
[00:27:26.454 --> 00:27:31.178]  And so to the police, the military, to all of you, you better decide what team you're on.
[00:27:32.349 --> 00:27:39.933]  You better decide whether you're going to stand with your family and the Republic, or whether you're going to go with the New World Order, who is going to destroy you.
[00:27:39.933 --> 00:27:43.655]  At least your financial future is going to be destroyed, and probably your physical future.
[00:27:43.655 --> 00:27:45.936]  If you don't, wake up now and get angry.
[00:27:45.936 --> 00:27:50.318]  And the general public, you better stop thanking me for speaking out and standing up and being involved.
[00:27:50.318 --> 00:27:53.880]  I'm just trying to engage in self-preservation here.
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:56.381]  What else am I supposed to do?
[00:27:56.381 --> 00:27:57.882]  What was I supposed to do as a man?
[00:27:59.042 --> 00:28:04.588]  Who by the age of 19 was pretty much fully awake of what was going on.
[00:28:04.588 --> 00:28:07.431]  I know, I was supposed to be chasing skirts and drinking beer.
[00:28:07.431 --> 00:28:09.553]  Doesn't mean I didn't do some of that.
[00:28:09.553 --> 00:28:13.798]  But at the same time, I had studied history.
[00:28:13.798 --> 00:28:15.279]  I thought that's what a man was supposed to do.
[00:28:15.279 --> 00:28:17.662]  I was involved in history.
[00:28:17.662 --> 00:28:19.804]  I knew about what my family had done in history.
[00:28:19.804 --> 00:28:21.326]  And I knew the job I had to do.
[00:28:22.364 --> 00:28:22.904]  Okay?
[00:28:22.904 --> 00:28:29.147]  The media tells you you're supposed to be a sophomoric, arrested development idiot.
[00:28:29.147 --> 00:28:31.349]  Well, that's what slaves are into.
[00:28:31.349 --> 00:28:32.309]  Not me.
[00:28:32.309 --> 00:28:32.709]  Not me.
[00:28:32.709 --> 00:28:33.770]  I'm a wild man.
[00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:36.291]  I want freedom.
[00:28:36.291 --> 00:28:38.392]  And so, you better look in the mirror, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:28:38.392 --> 00:28:41.954]  You better ask yourselves, right now, where you're going to be.
[00:28:41.954 --> 00:28:44.315]  What you're going to do in the future.
[00:28:44.315 --> 00:28:47.477]  Are you going to be an actor in history, actually having an effect?
[00:28:48.356 --> 00:28:49.577]  I don't mean an actor in Hollywood.
[00:28:49.577 --> 00:28:55.342]  I mean, you know, a physical actor in the great stage that is life that Shakespeare talked about.
[00:28:56.078 --> 00:29:01.401]  Are you going to be someone who has a role in the future destiny of mankind?
[00:29:01.401 --> 00:29:07.585]  Or are you going to sit on the sidelines and do nothing and let a bunch of criminal globalists run over you and steal everything you got?
[00:29:07.585 --> 00:29:24.015]  Because history has proven 100% of the time, when you lay down and aren't involved in society and when you are a foolish buffoon who knows all about the latest fashions and how to act cool and how to be trendy, fashion and trendiness is the mark of slaves.
[00:29:25.526 --> 00:29:30.370]  3,000 years ago, they introduced fashions in China to enslave the population.
[00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:40.378]  They wrote history books about it 3,000 years ago in Persia, in China, in India, how to enslave people.
[00:29:40.378 --> 00:29:40.758]  Okay?
[00:29:40.758 --> 00:29:45.962]  Alright, we're gonna come back, hit more news, go to your phone calls, but a lot is going on, a lot is happening.
[00:29:45.962 --> 00:29:51.006]  In fact, your calls are straight ahead.
[00:29:51.006 --> 00:29:52.408]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.408 --> 00:29:53.909]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.918 --> 00:30:00.963]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.963 --> 00:30:03.985]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:30:03.985 --> 00:30:09.309]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:30:09.309 --> 00:30:11.351]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:30:11.351 --> 00:30:16.354]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:30:16.354 --> 00:30:17.535]  How much do you want?
[00:30:17.535 --> 00:30:18.276]  When do you want it?
[00:30:18.636 --> 00:30:20.537]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:30:20.537 --> 00:30:21.597]  When will you need it?
[00:30:21.597 --> 00:30:23.797]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:30:23.797 --> 00:30:25.138]  Will there be any food?
[00:30:25.138 --> 00:30:26.678]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:30:26.678 --> 00:30:31.939]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:30:31.939 --> 00:30:35.520]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:38.981]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:30:39.341 --> 00:30:40.562]  How much will you need?
[00:30:40.562 --> 00:30:41.463]  We don't know.
[00:30:41.463 --> 00:30:42.584]  How much do you want?
[00:30:42.584 --> 00:30:43.505]  All you can get.
[00:30:43.505 --> 00:30:44.607]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:30:44.607 --> 00:30:47.650]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:49.432]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:30:49.432 --> 00:30:50.352]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:30:59.875 --> 00:31:04.418]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:31:04.418 --> 00:31:05.338]  Number 1.
[00:31:05.338 --> 00:31:08.761]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:31:08.761 --> 00:31:09.621]  Number 2.
[00:31:09.621 --> 00:31:14.524]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:31:14.524 --> 00:31:15.265]  It's true.
[00:31:15.265 --> 00:31:20.128]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:31:20.128 --> 00:31:20.968]  Number 3.
[00:31:20.968 --> 00:31:24.551]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:31:24.551 --> 00:31:28.253]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:31:28.433 --> 00:31:29.233]  Number 4.
[00:31:29.233 --> 00:31:31.994]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:31:31.994 --> 00:31:35.676]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:31:35.676 --> 00:31:36.476]  Number 5.
[00:31:36.476 --> 00:31:40.618]  A solar-powered generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:31:40.618 --> 00:31:45.680]  Folks, I really believe in the solar-powered generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:49.841]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:49.841 --> 00:31:51.642]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:51.642 --> 00:31:56.164]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1
[00:31:57.785 --> 00:31:58.606]  877-327-0365.
[00:31:58.606 --> 00:32:01.529]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:32:01.529 --> 00:32:04.893]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.
[00:32:04.893 --> 00:32:10.118]  This is an American-made product of the highest quality and compares to nothing you will find in stores.
[00:32:10.118 --> 00:32:13.562]  You can buy factory direct, shipped via UPS right to your door.
[00:32:13.562 --> 00:32:15.904]  Check them out on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[00:32:16.525 --> 00:32:20.049]  Or call 800-340-7091.
[00:32:20.049 --> 00:32:21.190]  Take my word for it.
[00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:23.853]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[00:32:23.853 --> 00:32:30.359]  Since 1947, Calvin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[00:32:30.359 --> 00:32:31.861]  Buy American and stay clean.

[00:32:51.919 --> 00:32:52.299]  Thank you!
[00:33:06.613 --> 00:33:14.057]  Yeah, these corrupt globalists can run on for a long time, for a long time.
[00:33:14.057 --> 00:33:31.627]  But the minute you get a fighting spirit, the minute you start spreading that mindset, that idea, that infectious virus of liberty, the enemy will start imploding.
[00:33:31.627 --> 00:33:32.928]  It is a spirit.
[00:33:32.928 --> 00:33:33.728]  It's an attitude.
[00:33:33.728 --> 00:33:34.629]  It's a mindset.
[00:33:35.779 --> 00:33:37.040]  You've got to break your conditioning.
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:41.382]  You've got to break the spell you're under.
[00:33:41.382 --> 00:33:43.643]  I'm going to go to your calls and back into all the news.
[00:33:43.643 --> 00:33:46.765]  Or I'll never get to your calls if I continue with the news.
[00:33:46.765 --> 00:33:48.846]  But I wanted to just make a point.
[00:33:48.846 --> 00:33:57.050]  I was listening to an ad that I cut for solar power generators during the break.
[00:33:57.050 --> 00:34:04.794]  And I have a line in there about there's legislation all over the country with smart meters in your home and business where the government controls your thermostats.
[00:34:06.567 --> 00:34:14.393]  And it just hit me again that I remember a decade ago they were proposing it in California.
[00:34:14.393 --> 00:34:18.075]  I read the government and MIT and other reports.
[00:34:18.075 --> 00:34:20.257]  They said we're going to control everybody's house.
[00:34:20.257 --> 00:34:23.939]  We're going to have smart refrigerators that track everything that's in your refrigerator.
[00:34:23.939 --> 00:34:27.062]  Then CPS will be called if your children aren't eating healthy.
[00:34:27.062 --> 00:34:31.965]  Eldercare will be called on old people to take them basically to be euthanized.
[00:34:31.965 --> 00:34:34.147]  You know, it described to government care.
[00:34:35.233 --> 00:34:36.534]  They're phasing in the euthanasia.
[00:34:36.534 --> 00:34:39.855]  Europe already has it.
[00:34:39.855 --> 00:34:43.197]  And we're gonna remote control people's thermostats.
[00:34:43.197 --> 00:34:46.179]  And we're not gonna let people have it set at 75, 76.
[00:34:46.179 --> 00:34:51.722]  You know, we'll get people trained incrementally to just basically not even have air conditioner.
[00:34:51.722 --> 00:34:56.484]  We'll get them, you know, up to 85 or so degrees in the house.
[00:34:56.484 --> 00:34:57.385]  For the Earth, of course.
[00:34:59.512 --> 00:35:13.721]  And now I read articles every week or two without looking of new retirement homes all over the country where they get government grants, if they're quote smart houses, where there's sensors in the refrigerators tracking everything the old people do.
[00:35:13.721 --> 00:35:18.164]  They have elder care popping by as if it's a service.
[00:35:18.164 --> 00:35:21.727]  Everyone at Head Start gets CPS visits three times a year.
[00:35:21.727 --> 00:35:23.488]  That's what the feds have announced as the mandate.
[00:35:25.472 --> 00:35:26.653]  You haven't gotten the knock on the door.
[00:35:26.653 --> 00:35:27.114]  They're coming.
[00:35:27.114 --> 00:35:31.078]  We're now going to have yearly census with them demanding stuff at your door.
[00:35:31.078 --> 00:35:38.927]  I was at the lake fishing on the end of a pier two weeks ago and a census worker came out and I said, I don't live here.
[00:35:38.927 --> 00:35:39.828]  I'm fishing.
[00:35:39.828 --> 00:35:43.533]  And the guys started asking my name and I said, look, I'm not answering your question.
[00:35:45.595 --> 00:35:47.896]  Get thee gone, government person!
[00:35:47.896 --> 00:35:52.238]  I'm not here to be lined up and ask questions by you, the secret police!
[00:35:52.238 --> 00:35:56.880]  And I've got the government reports 20 years ago how they plan to have us doing weekly census.
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:01.543]  And they're going to have an environmental chief on every block that comes in and inspects your house.
[00:36:01.543 --> 00:36:03.523]  This is all slave training!
[00:36:03.523 --> 00:36:08.926]  What do you think it is when they take your baby's blood at birth for 37 years and put it in the Pentagon database?
[00:36:08.926 --> 00:36:10.527]  And now they admit it to you.
[00:36:10.527 --> 00:36:11.847]  See, they think you're slaves now.
[00:36:11.847 --> 00:36:12.788]  They think you're broke back.
[00:36:14.122 --> 00:36:16.103]  I'd tell you about it 15 years ago, you'd laugh.
[00:36:16.103 --> 00:36:17.023]  The government would never do that.
[00:36:17.023 --> 00:36:19.784]  Now they just admit it and you go, oh, well, I guess it's good.
[00:36:19.784 --> 00:36:26.487]  Oh, they're going to put you through naked body scanners and admit they're recording you and your family's genitals and laughing at it.
[00:36:26.487 --> 00:36:31.489]  It's so bad they laugh at their own employees' genitals that have to go through it every day until they beat each other up.
[00:36:32.506 --> 00:36:36.208]  And they print out Hollywood people's genitals and say, sign this for me.
[00:36:36.208 --> 00:36:40.950]  And it comes out in the news and Homeland Security reports admit they're recording your genitals.
[00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:44.271]  We're going to record your genitals and we're going to do it because we like it.
[00:36:44.271 --> 00:36:50.133]  And now I have mainstream news about brain scanners in the airports.
[00:36:50.133 --> 00:36:53.415]  Hundreds of thousands of innocent people were sent to prison for brain scanners.
[00:36:55.856 --> 00:37:03.900]  Hundreds of thousands of people were sent to prison for lie detectors, excuse me, made up quack machines, and they sent them to prison.
[00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:05.441]  They sent them to death row.
[00:37:05.441 --> 00:37:07.762]  Turns out it's totally made up and fake, basically.
[00:37:08.635 --> 00:37:10.978]  It's just a way to trick people into admitting they're lying.
[00:37:10.978 --> 00:37:12.580]  Well, now they got even fancier.
[00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:22.391]  Now, lie detectors aren't admissible in court after 50 years of people exposing them, so now they have quack machines, Robby the Robot systems, that say you're really a terrorist.
[00:37:22.391 --> 00:37:27.257]  And they train minimum wage workers on facial expressions that mean you're a terrorist.
[00:37:29.616 --> 00:37:33.499]  And they tell them, you know, today we're looking for gray-haired women above 70.
[00:37:33.499 --> 00:37:34.380]  They may be terrorists.
[00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:35.441]  That's the alert.
[00:37:35.441 --> 00:37:40.785]  There's no real alert on 70-year-old women that are terrorists.
[00:37:40.785 --> 00:37:45.109]  They're just having you be trained to go after everybody and see everybody as a terrorist.
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:53.044]  Old men with oxygen tanks are their favorites, or making people in wheelchairs that can't walk, get up, or turning them back.
[00:37:53.044 --> 00:37:54.365]  That's in the news.
[00:37:54.365 --> 00:37:56.446]  It's all about the absurdity.
[00:37:56.446 --> 00:37:59.488]  Training you to accept absurd oppression.
[00:37:59.488 --> 00:38:09.154]  Because if they can get you to accept over-the-top ridiculous things, you know, why does the Marine Corps make people call themselves names and chant stupid slogans and beat each other up?
[00:38:09.154 --> 00:38:10.936]  Because if they can make you do something stupid,
[00:38:11.696 --> 00:38:18.661]  Like grabbing your genitals and marching down the middle saying, this is my rifle, this is my gun, this is for fighting, this is for fun.
[00:38:18.661 --> 00:38:24.124]  If they can make you do stupid things when they tell you to do other things, you're going to follow those orders.
[00:38:24.124 --> 00:38:27.026]  I don't, I didn't sign up for mind control.
[00:38:27.026 --> 00:38:29.028]  I didn't sign up to be under mind control.
[00:38:29.028 --> 00:38:29.768]  You understand that?
[00:38:29.768 --> 00:38:31.149]  Alright, I'm going to your calls.
[00:38:31.149 --> 00:38:33.511]  The point is, it just, it all hit me during the break.
[00:38:34.924 --> 00:38:40.548]  Imagine, land of the free, home of the brave, where we now have all over the country, Austin already has it.
[00:38:40.548 --> 00:38:47.773]  They didn't ask me last year, they came in my office and they put smart meters on where they control the thermostats in my office.
[00:38:47.773 --> 00:38:49.354]  They didn't ask.
[00:38:49.354 --> 00:38:54.057]  They just came and did it.
[00:38:54.057 --> 00:38:58.240]  And they're putting smart meters in on gas, on electric, on everything.
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:38:58.821]  They didn't ask.
[00:39:01.343 --> 00:39:09.148]  And even if I get a generator, the city of Austin now wants a tax on my generator with some little knuckle-dragging inspector I've got to deal with.
[00:39:09.148 --> 00:39:19.654]  Some control freak that couldn't get a real job but likes to look down on business people that actually work and actually put their own money into things and actually work more than eight hours a day.
[00:39:19.654 --> 00:39:22.096]  Real men that don't enjoy telling people what to do.
[00:39:22.096 --> 00:39:25.558]  Go ahead and play it.
[00:39:25.558 --> 00:39:27.699]  This is my rifle, this is my gun, this is for fun.
[00:39:33.981 --> 00:39:48.856]  Alright, that's enough.
[00:39:48.856 --> 00:39:52.199]  The issue is, they take your baby's blood secretly?
[00:39:52.199 --> 00:39:53.861]  What a creepy evil government!
[00:39:56.004 --> 00:40:04.851]  They naked body scan you and your family and then tell you they're not when on record they are and they're saving all of it?
[00:40:04.851 --> 00:40:14.299]  They put in remote control systems to control your thermostat from California to Texas?
[00:40:14.299 --> 00:40:16.181]  They put brain scanners in the airports?
[00:40:18.302 --> 00:40:22.085]  They're training your kids to spy on you in the public schools.
[00:40:22.085 --> 00:40:24.527]  It goes on and on and on.
[00:40:24.527 --> 00:40:35.255]  They're going to have weekly censuses now, not just yearly, with control freaks showing up constantly at your door, telling you to violate your own Fifth Amendment.
[00:40:35.255 --> 00:40:38.838]  I mean, I can't even go to a public park
[00:40:41.092 --> 00:40:49.542]  And stand on the end of a pier and stick a worm on the end of a hook without some 20-year-old zit-faced punk trying to tell me to answer questions.
[00:40:49.542 --> 00:40:51.645]  No, I'm not going to.
[00:40:51.645 --> 00:40:52.686]  Do you understand?
[00:40:52.686 --> 00:40:54.188]  I'm done!
[00:40:54.188 --> 00:40:54.809]  I'm done!
[00:40:54.809 --> 00:40:56.431]  I'm done!
[00:40:56.431 --> 00:40:57.732]  You don't own me, scum!
[00:40:58.513 --> 00:41:00.215]  You understand that!
[00:41:00.215 --> 00:41:06.260]  I know the government is narcotics trafficking, child kidnap trafficking, pedophile trash!
[00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:08.082]  I'm calling you out filth!
[00:41:08.082 --> 00:41:09.443]  I know what you are!
[00:41:09.443 --> 00:41:15.369]  Run by a bunch of degenerate psychological warfare psychiatrists, most of them a bunch of pervs!
[00:41:15.369 --> 00:41:16.990]  Have you read the literature they write?
[00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:18.232]  Most of them support NAMBLA!
[00:41:19.946 --> 00:41:22.768]  Look, the government wants to be able to grab your kids and rape them.
[00:41:22.768 --> 00:41:25.851]  I mean, at the end of the day, that's what it comes down to.
[00:41:25.851 --> 00:41:28.333]  And you better grow up, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:28.333 --> 00:41:29.794]  You better grow up.
[00:41:29.794 --> 00:41:33.057]  You better grow up right now and admit just how bad it is.
[00:41:33.057 --> 00:41:35.379]  Hitler snuck up on the Germans.
[00:41:35.379 --> 00:41:38.542]  Lenin snuck up on the commies in Russia.
[00:41:38.542 --> 00:41:41.865]  Mao snuck up on those peasants that brought him to power.
[00:41:41.865 --> 00:41:44.427]  First thing he did was kill at least 64 million of them!
[00:41:48.103 --> 00:41:49.204]  Alright, I can't handle it anymore.
[00:41:49.204 --> 00:41:51.708]  I said I'd go to your calls.
[00:41:51.708 --> 00:41:56.994]  It's just so obvious that we shouldn't be putting up with any of this.
[00:41:56.994 --> 00:41:58.576]  Any of this!
[00:41:58.576 --> 00:42:01.660]  Oh, now the police... First, they get fake warrants.
[00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:04.303]  The judge would just swear out fake mass warrants.
[00:42:05.552 --> 00:42:14.038]  In Phoenix, Arizona, in Austin, Texas, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in Buffalo, New York, in Tampa, Florida.
[00:42:14.038 --> 00:42:15.599]  It's all federal grants.
[00:42:15.599 --> 00:42:28.287]  They have big RVs out there with lazy cops waddling around, randomly pulling people over, letting the illegal aliens go on record, totally drunk, only wanting scum citizens, scum-filled citizens they see as the prey animal they feed on.
[00:42:28.287 --> 00:42:28.587]  It's fun.
[00:42:33.424 --> 00:42:35.985]  They don't know they're prey to the New World Order as well.
[00:42:35.985 --> 00:42:39.646]  And then they would jam needles in people's arms on the side of the highway.
[00:42:39.646 --> 00:42:41.247]  And then lawsuits got filed.
[00:42:41.247 --> 00:42:45.529]  So Texas just passed legislation saying, look, we don't need no stinking Fourth Amendment.
[00:42:45.529 --> 00:42:49.070]  Take blood whenever you want on the side of the road.
[00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:50.431]  No more Fourth Amendment.
[00:42:50.431 --> 00:42:53.232]  Oh, it's so fun.
[00:42:53.232 --> 00:42:58.074]  And one of my lawyers is a former judge, state judge.
[00:43:00.183 --> 00:43:05.885]  And I was a few months ago in his office having a meeting with him, and he just said, I can't believe they passed that law.
[00:43:05.885 --> 00:43:06.706]  I can't believe it.
[00:43:06.706 --> 00:43:08.326]  This is the end of America.
[00:43:08.326 --> 00:43:14.169]  Well, that's why, you know, he's a retired judge.
[00:43:14.169 --> 00:43:16.130]  Made more money in private practice.
[00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:18.911]  The kind of scum that want to be judges now.
[00:43:18.911 --> 00:43:19.311]  They love it.
[00:43:23.507 --> 00:43:25.107]  Alright, I'm gonna stop here in just a minute.
[00:43:25.107 --> 00:43:31.709]  I just... Listen, when the government's staking your baby's blood at birth secretly, you gotta crunk government, okay?
[00:43:31.709 --> 00:43:41.452]  When they're putting hundreds of poisons in the water that they know attack your hypothalamus, your sexual organs, your liver, your kidneys, your... You like bladder cancer?
[00:43:42.592 --> 00:43:48.754]  Ten years of one part per million sodium fluoride in studies more than quadruples bladder cancer.
[00:43:48.754 --> 00:43:50.414]  You like bladder cancer?
[00:43:50.414 --> 00:43:53.715]  It more than doubles bone cancer across the board.
[00:43:53.715 --> 00:43:55.976]  More than quadruples it in men.
[00:43:55.976 --> 00:43:56.936]  You like bone cancer?
[00:43:56.936 --> 00:43:58.317]  Oh, it's real painful, I'm told.
[00:44:00.370 --> 00:44:01.331]  You think that's cute, huh?
[00:44:01.331 --> 00:44:03.172]  Oh, you're tough guys, cops, huh?
[00:44:03.172 --> 00:44:04.493]  The government gave you a little power?
[00:44:04.493 --> 00:44:06.955]  They gave you a little power to violate the Bill of Rights?
[00:44:06.955 --> 00:44:07.596]  Well, let me tell you something.
[00:44:07.596 --> 00:44:08.777]  You think you're tough?
[00:44:08.777 --> 00:44:14.121]  You work for a government that jacks your water supply with chemical weapons!
[00:44:14.121 --> 00:44:15.182]  And I'm red-blooded!
[00:44:15.182 --> 00:44:18.284]  This is the response you're supposed to have to stuff like this!
[00:44:18.284 --> 00:44:25.350]  You can sit there and call... Listen, listen, even if you think I'm a nut, you might as well go research what I said, but no, you won't do that.
[00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:28.392]  If you did research it, you'd find out I was telling you the truth.
[00:44:28.392 --> 00:44:31.455]  And then if you had any soul, you'd be acting just like I am.
[00:44:31.455 --> 00:44:39.781]  This is a normal behavior when people are poisoning your water!
[00:44:39.781 --> 00:44:40.342]  I'm sorry.
[00:44:40.342 --> 00:44:53.633]  See, it just made me mad to be reminded during that break that they're taking control of our thermostats, and now they're announcing they're going to start deciding how much electricity you can have.
[00:44:53.633 --> 00:44:54.574]  I mean, this is real.
[00:44:56.052 --> 00:44:56.893]  This is real!
[00:44:56.893 --> 00:44:59.516]  This isn't a game, people!
[00:44:59.516 --> 00:45:01.057]  None of it's a game!
[00:45:01.057 --> 00:45:03.560]  None of it's a game!
[00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:10.267]  And now, they're all over the news announcing they're going to shut down most of talk radio, the internet, and everything else.
[00:45:10.267 --> 00:45:14.110]  They're not just saying they're going to tax it irregularly, they're talking about totally shutting it down!
[00:45:14.110 --> 00:45:15.131]  Openly!
[00:45:15.131 --> 00:45:16.213]  Like with a straight face!
[00:45:19.295 --> 00:45:22.016]  What, are they going to send cops over here when the time comes?
[00:45:22.016 --> 00:45:24.918]  Saying, we don't agree with them, Mr. Jones, but we're just doing our job.
[00:45:24.918 --> 00:45:27.599]  I mean, at what point do we stand up against you people?
[00:45:27.599 --> 00:45:28.620]  At what point?
[00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:32.302]  At what level of crime will you not commit against us?
[00:45:32.302 --> 00:45:37.685]  I don't care if the corrupt scum in Washington tell you it's okay.
[00:45:37.685 --> 00:45:39.265]  It isn't okay, okay?
[00:45:39.265 --> 00:45:44.028]  I don't care if Hitler said he had the law behind him to murder people and launch wars.
[00:45:45.689 --> 00:45:54.195]  I say the law that's in my gut and in my brain and in my soul says I have a right to resist you however I need to!
[00:45:54.195 --> 00:45:56.317]  You understand that?
[00:45:56.317 --> 00:46:02.101]  But the truth is we're kicking the New World Order's butt with the info war and that's why they want to shut us down.
[00:46:02.101 --> 00:46:04.082]  They want to... What was the quote guys?
[00:46:04.082 --> 00:46:05.724]  Print me the Kennedy quote.
[00:46:05.724 --> 00:46:09.947]  Those that make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable.
[00:46:10.984 --> 00:46:14.846]  Or those that make peaceful change impossible, make violent revolution inevitable.
[00:46:14.846 --> 00:46:18.308]  Forget the exact quote.
[00:46:18.308 --> 00:46:21.829]  I mean, there comes a time where you just can't lick the boots anymore.
[00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:28.032]  You just can't kiss the big, wart-covered hind end of the New World Order and the pot-bellied little government servants.
[00:46:28.032 --> 00:46:30.353]  There comes a time when you can't lay down anymore.
[00:46:30.353 --> 00:46:33.555]  There comes a time when you just can't put up with it anymore!
[00:46:33.555 --> 00:46:37.777]  I'm gonna settle down.
[00:46:39.093 --> 00:46:42.659]  I don't know if I'm immune to the fluoride or what it is, because it is a toxic sedative.
[00:46:42.659 --> 00:46:43.961]  Of course, I don't drink it.
[00:46:43.961 --> 00:46:46.806]  So when I'm out at a restaurant, I still do it, drink the iced tea or whatever.
[00:46:47.782 --> 00:46:51.505]  I don't know what your problem is out there, red-blooded men.
[00:46:51.505 --> 00:46:55.828]  You thank me for going to City Council and the State Legislature and Congress?
[00:46:55.828 --> 00:46:57.710]  You thank me for making films?
[00:46:57.710 --> 00:47:00.372]  What is stopping you from taking action?
[00:47:00.372 --> 00:47:03.214]  And a lot of people are taking action, and that's why the globalists are scared.
[00:47:03.214 --> 00:47:04.635]  But I'm telling you, we don't have much time.
[00:47:04.635 --> 00:47:07.278]  You've got to launch your info-war operations right now!
[00:47:07.278 --> 00:47:10.700]  Banner hangs, mini-documentaries, newsletters, websites!
[00:47:12.526 --> 00:47:14.847]  Look, you don't have to do it perfect.
[00:47:14.847 --> 00:47:21.328]  Everybody wait for the perfect opportunity, the perfect crafted information, or the perfect way to deliver it.
[00:47:21.328 --> 00:47:22.228]  No!
[00:47:22.228 --> 00:47:23.429]  Just take action!
[00:47:23.429 --> 00:47:24.349]  It's all we've got!
[00:47:24.349 --> 00:47:27.310]  Alright, I'm going to your calls.
[00:47:27.310 --> 00:47:35.091]  John F. Kennedy in a speech at the White House in 1962, he said, those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable.
[00:47:35.091 --> 00:47:37.092]  Homeland Security will probably list him as a terrorist next.
[00:47:37.092 --> 00:47:39.692]  They already listed Thomas Jefferson and George Washington.
[00:47:39.692 --> 00:47:41.713]  Oh yeah, I have the training manuals, I have video.
[00:47:43.123 --> 00:47:44.744]  And don't sit there, cops, and laugh.
[00:47:44.744 --> 00:47:46.566]  A lot of you have been in the training.
[00:47:46.566 --> 00:47:51.910]  It's in my film, Road to Tyranny, video of FEMA teaching cops, firemen, and police that, and you know it's true.
[00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:54.552]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jeff in California.
[00:47:54.552 --> 00:47:55.412]  Jeff, you're on the air.
[00:47:55.412 --> 00:47:56.033]  Thanks for holding.
[00:47:57.052 --> 00:47:59.514]  Alright Alex, hey, great job.
[00:47:59.514 --> 00:48:01.655]  I'll do, I have three things, I'll make it quick, okay?
[00:48:01.655 --> 00:48:03.957]  I'm a palmer pipe fitter, alright?
[00:48:03.957 --> 00:48:08.400]  Watchin' the way they put that saw in there, they set it up to get, uh, pinched.
[00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:15.025]  You have a whole back, you got a pipe leaning to the right, you got the whole back side wide open, but they cut it from the side so the pipe can pinch it.
[00:48:15.525 --> 00:48:35.515]  Yeah, I noticed that, and I'm no genius, but they did cut it the way it was leaning, and any moron knows if a tree's leaning, say, to the southwest, then you go over to the northeast side of the tree to cut it so it will fall the direction it's already leaning so it doesn't fall on you.
[00:48:35.515 --> 00:48:36.816]  I mean, that is a good point.
[00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:39.841]  And the other thing is, that is a flange.
[00:48:39.841 --> 00:48:44.362]  If anybody's familiar with a flange, that's how you connect another piece of pipe to another.
[00:48:44.362 --> 00:48:45.622]  There's a flanger.
[00:48:45.622 --> 00:48:55.405]  Cut the bolts off the flange, slide two rods up, bring a piece of pipe down with a gasket on it, over the two rods, you put your little bolts in one at a time, you got it sealed.
[00:48:55.405 --> 00:48:57.866]  No, they crush the top to make it worse.
[00:48:57.866 --> 00:49:05.268]  Now my other thing is... Well here's the deal, hold on, I'm gonna hold you over if need be, but it's time for Watson, or Kurt, or Steve,
[00:49:06.488 --> 00:49:10.112]  Aaron's too busy on the film we're working on to do a full report.
[00:49:10.112 --> 00:49:21.905]  They dumped 44% of their stock then about 8% more so it's total of what 52% of the Goldman Sachs two days before and the day after but 44% two days before.
[00:49:21.905 --> 00:49:24.848]  It turns out the CEO of BP
[00:49:26.189 --> 00:49:26.750]  Okay, one more thing.
[00:49:26.750 --> 00:49:28.251]  Now everybody listen up closely.
[00:49:28.251 --> 00:49:28.791]  This is a possibility.
[00:49:52.952 --> 00:49:59.196]  This is coming out of a website called, just letting you know, I'm going to be on a ball, called the Intel Hub.
[00:49:59.196 --> 00:50:01.657]  I don't know if you've ever heard of them.
[00:50:01.657 --> 00:50:04.979]  But basically, red alert possibility.
[00:50:04.979 --> 00:50:08.262]  Battle-hardened troops on guard arriving in golf.
[00:50:08.262 --> 00:50:15.226]  With 50mm cannons, machine guns on top, full battle gear, waiting for pictures to be sent today.
[00:50:16.079 --> 00:50:18.100]  Uh, it was in Grand Isle, Louisiana.
[00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:23.821]  The report came to us through the C-9... Uh, well, I don't like... Listen, I appreciate your call, uh, Jeff.
[00:50:23.821 --> 00:50:27.983]  You know, I don't like to go off of, uh, internet speculation.
[00:50:27.983 --> 00:50:32.504]  Though, Obama did say he was dispatching SWAT teams, uh, to the Gulf.
[00:50:34.173 --> 00:50:36.135]  And the Gulf is collapsing.
[00:50:36.135 --> 00:50:37.996]  It's going to devastate their economy.
[00:50:37.996 --> 00:50:43.721]  And people are already attacking BP stations, egging them, spraying graffiti on them.
[00:50:43.721 --> 00:50:46.363]  And so, I would imagine they are going to deploy troops.
[00:50:46.363 --> 00:50:50.986]  I mean, I got video all over the country where they just have National Guard out for a local basketball game.
[00:50:50.986 --> 00:50:55.189]  They'll direct traffic when there's no need in the middle of corn rows.
[00:50:55.189 --> 00:50:57.031]  All acclimating the slaves.
[00:50:57.031 --> 00:50:59.473]  Alright, Nathan, Tom, Dan, Curry, your calls are coming up.
[00:51:00.987 --> 00:51:10.194]  Global meltdowns, massive unemployment, endless wars, a new currency crisis, financially and morally bankrupt, a great and terrible storm is approaching.
[00:51:10.194 --> 00:51:13.757]  So what's the best way to get ready to get prepared for hard times ahead?
[00:51:13.757 --> 00:51:23.345]  Introducing Off The Grid News, a weekly newsletter for independent patriots who want practical advice on how to survive and prosper in an increasingly dangerous world.
[00:51:23.345 --> 00:51:28.609]  It's the best way to get a black belt in emergency preparedness, survival skills, and off-the-grid living.

[00:52:01.235 --> 00:52:03.617]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:52:03.617 --> 00:52:05.939]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:52:05.939 --> 00:52:09.161]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:52:09.161 --> 00:52:14.265]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:14.265 --> 00:52:18.449]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:18.749 --> 00:52:21.110]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:21.110 --> 00:52:23.991]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:23.991 --> 00:52:26.893]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:26.893 --> 00:52:34.496]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:34.836 --> 00:52:40.238]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:40.238 --> 00:52:42.538]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:42.538 --> 00:52:46.759]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:46.759 --> 00:52:47.840]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:49.180]  You're everyone else.
[00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:50.681]  Invisible Empire.

[00:54:07.947 --> 00:54:09.788]  Okay, let's go back to your phone calls here.
[00:54:09.788 --> 00:54:13.269]  I got a bunch of news coming up as well.
[00:54:13.269 --> 00:54:16.410]  Global economic meltdown just accelerating.
[00:54:16.410 --> 00:54:19.931]  Gold up as high as $20 today.
[00:54:19.931 --> 00:54:20.371]  Up $20.
[00:54:20.371 --> 00:54:23.112]  Let's talk to Tom in Pennsylvania.
[00:54:23.112 --> 00:54:24.012]  You're on the air, Tom.
[00:54:24.012 --> 00:54:25.512]  Welcome.
[00:54:25.512 --> 00:54:25.953]  Hi, Alex.
[00:54:25.953 --> 00:54:26.793]  How you doing?
[00:54:26.793 --> 00:54:28.974]  Good.
[00:54:28.974 --> 00:54:36.876]  So, my friend, my stupid friend recently got arrested for growing a bunch of marijuana in his house.
[00:54:37.942 --> 00:54:58.373]  I was just wondering if you had any legal advice I could pass on to him, since I know you've talked to people with the... Well, I mean, if people have got self-control, they shouldn't drink, they shouldn't smoke pot, they shouldn't speed, they shouldn't do anything wrong, because we're in a criminal government looking for any excuse to throw the book at what they see as the target.
[00:54:58.373 --> 00:55:00.154]  The enemy is the American people.
[00:55:01.154 --> 00:55:06.598]  Unless you're going to change your name and pose as an illegal alien, I wouldn't commit crime.
[00:55:06.598 --> 00:55:12.922]  If you're an illegal alien, literally, you could even commit serial murders like the railway killer he killed over and over again.
[00:55:12.922 --> 00:55:14.604]  They kept letting him go.
[00:55:14.604 --> 00:55:19.047]  If you announce yourself as a god, an illegal alien, then you'll be left alone.
[00:55:19.047 --> 00:55:20.648]  But I don't encourage anybody to commit crime.
[00:55:20.648 --> 00:55:23.430]  I was being somewhat sarcastic there.
[00:55:23.430 --> 00:55:24.611]  I wouldn't grow marijuana.
[00:55:25.939 --> 00:55:30.302]  And I'm not going to tell him what to do.
[00:55:30.302 --> 00:55:32.884]  I mean, I wouldn't plea bargain if I'd done it.
[00:55:32.884 --> 00:55:35.065]  I would continue to fight it.
[00:55:35.065 --> 00:55:37.087]  But that's the decision for him to make.
[00:55:37.087 --> 00:55:39.208]  Dan, I appreciate your call.
[00:55:39.208 --> 00:55:39.929]  Or Tom.
[00:55:39.929 --> 00:55:41.249]  Now we're going to Dan in Minnesota.
[00:55:41.249 --> 00:55:42.030]  Dan, you're on the air.
[00:55:42.030 --> 00:55:45.092]  Go ahead.
[00:55:45.092 --> 00:55:47.234]  Hello, Dan.
[00:55:47.234 --> 00:55:48.354]  Welcome.
[00:55:48.354 --> 00:55:49.235]  Hi, Alex.
[00:55:49.235 --> 00:55:49.615]  Yes.
[00:55:49.615 --> 00:55:50.276]  First time caller.
[00:55:50.276 --> 00:55:52.697]  I just got two quick questions for you.
[00:55:52.697 --> 00:55:53.958]  Welcome.
[00:55:53.958 --> 00:55:54.318]  Hi.
[00:55:56.630 --> 00:56:03.016]  You and Jim Tucker have been pretty good at exposing the New World Order and the Bilderberg Group.
[00:56:03.016 --> 00:56:08.261]  To slow them down a little bit, what are the chances of us slowing down the Committee of 300?
[00:56:08.261 --> 00:56:12.005]  Because aren't they more powerful than the Bilderberg Group?
[00:56:12.005 --> 00:56:17.170]  Well, look, the Committee of 300 doesn't really meet, and of course,
[00:56:19.246 --> 00:56:32.668]  The Committee of 300 is the larger grouping, or the name they give themselves, of the elite in Europe, the US, England, and Canada, and the Bilderberg Group is one of their key meetings, steering committees.
[00:56:32.668 --> 00:56:34.009]  So it's one and the same.
[00:56:34.009 --> 00:56:37.589]  People get, you know, the mainstream media always says, which is it, Alex?
[00:56:37.589 --> 00:56:39.770]  Does the Trilateral Commission run it?
[00:56:39.770 --> 00:56:41.650]  Does the Club of Rome run it?
[00:56:41.650 --> 00:56:43.370]  Does the CFR run it?
[00:56:43.370 --> 00:56:45.751]  Does the Royal Commission on International Affairs run it?
[00:56:46.872 --> 00:56:49.174]  Does the Bilderberg Group run it?
[00:56:49.174 --> 00:56:55.802]  All of those are chaired and co-chaired and steered by less than 20 people.
[00:56:55.802 --> 00:56:58.525]  And so the Club of Rome is over environmental takeovers.
[00:56:59.538 --> 00:57:05.700]  Trilateral Commission is between Asia, Europe, and North America on banking.
[00:57:05.700 --> 00:57:10.281]  So there's specialized corporate bodies that do this.
[00:57:10.281 --> 00:57:14.123]  But yes, the Bilderberg Group does have steering committee meetings.
[00:57:14.123 --> 00:57:15.403]  We should try to go to those.
[00:57:15.403 --> 00:57:17.704]  Trilateral Commission has meetings.
[00:57:17.704 --> 00:57:19.504]  Those are getting confronted.
[00:57:19.504 --> 00:57:20.725]  Club of Rome has meetings.
[00:57:20.725 --> 00:57:22.685]  We should go out to all of these.
[00:57:22.685 --> 00:57:25.286]  But you'll notice when you go to these meetings, it's all the same people.
[00:57:26.639 --> 00:57:32.181]  About once a month, the top globalists are meeting somewhere.
[00:57:32.181 --> 00:57:33.402]  Okay, thank you.
[00:57:33.402 --> 00:57:38.184]  And my second question is, I'm divorced and I have a seven-year-old son.
[00:57:38.184 --> 00:57:46.508]  My ex-wife works for the Sheriff's Department and she's one of those people that thinks government is God and will give them any vaccine under the sun.
[00:57:46.508 --> 00:57:50.189]  How do you deal with people like that?
[00:57:50.189 --> 00:57:51.690]  And this is your ex-wife?
[00:57:51.690 --> 00:57:51.870]  Yes.
[00:57:53.288 --> 00:57:59.433]  Well, again, she thinks she's getting away with something and showing you, and she knows best.
[00:57:59.433 --> 00:58:02.735]  I would bring her all of the vaccine inserts.
[00:58:02.735 --> 00:58:05.177]  I'd bring her the H1N1, the regular seasonal.
[00:58:05.177 --> 00:58:08.920]  I would underline Guillain-Barré neurological disorder.
[00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:11.282]  I would underline mercury thimerosal.
[00:58:11.282 --> 00:58:16.245]  And then I would bring fact sheets on each one and say, listen, honey, I'm sure I'm wrong about a lot of things.
[00:58:16.245 --> 00:58:17.827]  You're on a power trip.
[00:58:17.827 --> 00:58:18.727]  You know, you're the woman.
[00:58:18.727 --> 00:58:19.488]  You're in charge.
[00:58:19.488 --> 00:58:20.469]  You've got the uniform.
[00:58:20.469 --> 00:58:21.509]  I'm just the dumb male.
[00:58:22.330 --> 00:58:24.811]  But this really does hurt our baby.
[00:58:24.811 --> 00:58:29.573]  I know out of fear you give them the shots thinking it's going to protect them.
[00:58:29.573 --> 00:58:34.335]  But lots of stuff like hepatitis is only for sexually active or IV drug users.
[00:58:34.335 --> 00:58:37.757]  Please, please get on your knees if you have to.
[00:58:37.757 --> 00:58:40.218]  These type of slaves, they like a power trip.
[00:58:41.142 --> 00:58:46.783]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[00:58:46.783 --> 00:58:50.524]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[00:58:50.524 --> 00:58:52.824]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:58:52.824 --> 00:58:55.225]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:58:55.225 --> 00:58:58.445]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:58:58.445 --> 00:59:03.546]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:59:03.546 --> 00:59:07.727]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:59:08.047 --> 00:59:10.391]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:59:10.391 --> 00:59:13.295]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:59:13.295 --> 00:59:16.199]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:59:16.199 --> 00:59:23.811]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:59:24.130 --> 00:59:29.533]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:59:29.533 --> 00:59:32.375]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:59:32.375 --> 00:59:36.077]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:59:36.077 --> 00:59:37.138]  And I got news for you.
[00:59:37.138 --> 00:59:38.479]  You're everyone else.
[00:59:38.479 --> 00:59:39.980]  Invisible Empire.

[00:59:53.627 --> 00:59:56.028]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.028 --> 01:00:05.694]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.694 --> 01:00:06.995]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.995 --> 01:00:08.776]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.776 --> 01:00:10.517]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.517 --> 01:00:12.118]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.118 --> 01:00:14.039]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:14.039 --> 01:00:17.841]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.841 --> 01:00:21.904]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.482 --> 01:00:35.448]  Yeah, a fellow was just asking me at the end of the last hour, what does he do about his ex-wife who works for a sheriff's department, thinks the government's god, wants to inject their child with every new vaccine under the sun.
[01:00:35.448 --> 01:00:37.489]  Get on your knees if you have to.
[01:00:37.489 --> 01:00:39.990]  These government... worshippers...
[01:00:41.570 --> 01:00:44.773]  All you want to do is save your son from brain damage and cancer.
[01:00:44.773 --> 01:00:53.162]  And so if you have to get on your knees to her, to really get her attention and call her master, that's the type of thing that a power-tripping minion likes.
[01:00:53.162 --> 01:00:55.004]  And if it saves your child, it's worth it.
[01:00:55.004 --> 01:00:56.105]  I've always learned, you know.
[01:00:57.847 --> 01:01:03.132]  If you've got to prostrate yourself before someone to help them or to save someone, that's fine.
[01:01:03.132 --> 01:01:09.057]  It's important to subvert your ego and to basically turn it against itself.
[01:01:09.057 --> 01:01:15.643]  But to be serious, bring her all the news headlines with Gardasil killing women and not even protecting you.
[01:01:15.643 --> 01:01:19.466]  I have medical doctors on from the human papillomavirus.
[01:01:21.158 --> 01:01:30.803]  Give her the actual insert from the drug company, you can Google it and pull it up, where it admits that it causes cancer, infertility, brain damage.
[01:01:30.803 --> 01:01:40.107]  Point out to her, why do they give hepatitis, one of the most admittedly dangerous vaccines to newborn babies, when you only need it if you're an intravenous drug user or a prostitute.
[01:01:40.107 --> 01:01:46.370]  And just explain to her, look, you can't take all these unlimited vaccines.
[01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:47.131]  They're dangerous.
[01:01:48.437 --> 01:01:56.765]  I had the editor of the British Medical Journal on, a doctor last night, talking about how it's admittedly a hoax, the H1N1.
[01:01:56.765 --> 01:01:59.547]  They'll give her a whole file of stuff.
[01:01:59.547 --> 01:02:05.312]  I know Charlie Sheen had to file an injunction basically against his wife, ex-wife, and that worked.
[01:02:05.312 --> 01:02:10.757]  Then he had medical doctors come talk to her.
[01:02:10.757 --> 01:02:12.279]  I don't know.
[01:02:12.279 --> 01:02:13.400]  But it's an important question.
[01:02:14.588 --> 01:02:34.347]  By the way, I've got to get an article, a master article, buy a master article, an article that doesn't just cover one facet, but our specialty at InfoWars.com and FrozenPlanet.com is multifaceted, multivariate articles that hit things from different historical angles, so you get a full spectrum context.
[01:02:34.347 --> 01:02:35.508]  It's getting clearer and clearer.
[01:02:38.055 --> 01:02:40.757]  That there is censorship with the oil spill.
[01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:49.004]  And that everything is pointing towards an inside job, the motive being getting the carbon tax passed, that BP has spent billions of dollars of its own money lobbying for.
[01:02:49.004 --> 01:02:54.849]  Because BP itself is a subsidiary of European Private Central Banking Houses.
[01:02:54.849 --> 01:03:01.335]  I noticed that articles that Paul Watson wrote and others about Bill Gates would not make it on Google.
[01:03:01.335 --> 01:03:03.397]  PrisonPlanet.com is accepted by Google News.
[01:03:05.177 --> 01:03:09.580]  Anything we write is instantly posted on Google News, but nothing about Bill Gates.
[01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:12.643]  We did tests and wrote other articles with Bill Gates' name in it.
[01:03:12.643 --> 01:03:17.807]  There is a block on Bill Gates on negative news on Bill Gates on Google.
[01:03:17.807 --> 01:03:20.549]  Well, here's one out of the Examiner.
[01:03:20.549 --> 01:03:27.334]  BP buys Google Yahoo's search words to keep people away from real news on Gulf oil spill disaster.
[01:03:28.820 --> 01:03:36.844]  They already have government of power, BP does, with the Coast Guard and people saying, sorry, you can't film the oil in America.
[01:03:36.844 --> 01:03:39.125]  You can't come to a public beach and film oil.
[01:03:39.125 --> 01:03:40.746]  You know, we will arrest you.
[01:03:40.746 --> 01:03:41.607]  We have no law.
[01:03:41.607 --> 01:03:44.728]  We're just lawless thugs.
[01:03:44.728 --> 01:03:46.929]  And if you let them set the precedent on this, it's on anything.
[01:03:46.929 --> 01:03:49.050]  Just thugs telling you what to do.
[01:03:49.050 --> 01:03:51.372]  You want to live like they do in China or North Korea?
[01:03:51.372 --> 01:03:54.893]  Well, welcome to it, folks!
[01:03:54.893 --> 01:03:57.595]  You let them get away with all the things they do, it's over.
[01:03:58.655 --> 01:04:11.861]  All the media does is tell you, worship uniforms, worship government, you know, fancy outfits, just like a... Why did the chief a thousand years ago, you know, wear a headdress with big feathers that looked fancy and official?
[01:04:11.861 --> 01:04:13.682]  You know, why does the Pope wear a big fish hat?
[01:04:15.328 --> 01:04:18.571]  Uh, why does, uh, you know, cops wear big, fancy uniforms?
[01:04:18.571 --> 01:04:20.252]  It's like a rooster outfit.
[01:04:20.252 --> 01:04:21.734]  It lets you know they're the boss.
[01:04:21.734 --> 01:04:25.157]  Well, when they step outside the Bill of Rights and Constitution, they're not my boss!
[01:04:25.157 --> 01:04:26.778]  You understand that?
[01:04:26.778 --> 01:04:29.401]  I don't care how many monkey outfits they wear.
[01:04:29.401 --> 01:04:35.085]  I don't care if they, you know, dress up like some third world general with 14 stars on their arm.
[01:04:35.085 --> 01:04:37.588]  I'm not licking your boots!
[01:04:37.588 --> 01:04:39.569]  My authority is the Bill of Rights and Constitution!
[01:04:40.435 --> 01:04:43.976]  It's not backed up by some 10-star on some thug's chest.
[01:04:43.976 --> 01:04:44.876]  You understand that?
[01:04:44.876 --> 01:04:47.197]  It's backed up with my will!
[01:04:47.197 --> 01:04:48.837]  And I will defeat you, New World Order!
[01:04:48.837 --> 01:04:50.958]  I set my entire will against you!
[01:04:50.958 --> 01:04:55.379]  I pledge myself against you 100 million percent!
[01:04:55.379 --> 01:04:58.100]  I pledge my soul, everything against you!
[01:04:58.100 --> 01:05:00.361]  My full will is set against you!
[01:05:01.121 --> 01:05:04.145]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:05:04.145 --> 01:05:09.472]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:05:09.472 --> 01:05:11.534]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:05:11.534 --> 01:05:16.520]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:17.722]  How much do you want?
[01:05:17.722 --> 01:05:18.443]  When do you want it?
[01:05:18.823 --> 01:05:20.705]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:05:20.705 --> 01:05:21.786]  When will you need it?
[01:05:21.786 --> 01:05:23.988]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:05:23.988 --> 01:05:25.309]  Will there be any food?
[01:05:25.309 --> 01:05:26.850]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:05:26.850 --> 01:05:32.115]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:05:32.115 --> 01:05:35.258]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:05:35.698 --> 01:05:39.520]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:40.741]  How much will you need?
[01:05:40.741 --> 01:05:41.641]  We don't know.
[01:05:41.641 --> 01:05:42.742]  How much do you want?
[01:05:42.742 --> 01:05:43.682]  All you can get.
[01:05:43.682 --> 01:05:44.783]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:05:44.783 --> 01:05:47.824]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:05:47.824 --> 01:05:50.025]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:05:50.025 --> 01:05:51.026]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:06:00.239 --> 01:06:05.222]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:06:05.222 --> 01:06:06.202]  What have we got?
[01:06:06.202 --> 01:06:08.663]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:06:08.663 --> 01:06:09.664]  A republic.
[01:06:09.664 --> 01:06:12.305]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:06:12.305 --> 01:06:14.566]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:06:14.566 --> 01:06:16.587]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:06:16.587 --> 01:06:18.268]  So they think they own our land?
[01:06:18.268 --> 01:06:19.589]  They think they own our water?
[01:06:19.589 --> 01:06:20.209]  Children?
[01:06:20.209 --> 01:06:21.330]  Our education?
[01:06:21.330 --> 01:06:22.150]  Our money?
[01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:25.812]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:06:26.172 --> 01:06:31.160]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:32.182]  We have the facts.
[01:06:32.182 --> 01:06:33.323]  We have the Constitution.
[01:06:33.323 --> 01:06:34.245]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:06:34.245 --> 01:06:35.146]  We have common law.
[01:06:35.146 --> 01:06:37.650]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:06:37.650 --> 01:06:41.436]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:06:41.516 --> 01:06:46.478]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:06:46.478 --> 01:06:47.978]  A new tool in the Info War.
[01:06:47.978 --> 01:06:49.079]  Don't tread on me.
[01:06:49.079 --> 01:06:55.141]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[01:07:00.137 --> 01:07:04.319]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:07:04.319 --> 01:07:10.723]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:07:10.723 --> 01:07:18.107]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:07:18.107 --> 01:07:22.650]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[01:07:22.970 --> 01:07:31.635]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.
[01:07:31.635 --> 01:07:35.897]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[01:07:35.897 --> 01:07:42.021]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:07:42.681 --> 01:07:46.582]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:07:46.582 --> 01:07:58.886]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[01:07:58.886 --> 01:08:06.129]  Thank you!
[01:08:06.129 --> 01:08:06.709]  Big Brother
[01:08:07.407 --> 01:08:09.188]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:09.188 --> 01:08:10.948]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:10.948 --> 01:08:12.529]  You want answers?
[01:08:12.529 --> 01:08:14.070]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:14.070 --> 01:08:18.271]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:18.271 --> 01:08:27.015]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:27.015 --> 01:08:31.036]  Well, Helen Thomas has now retired.
[01:08:31.036 --> 01:08:34.998]  Drugs Report has the headline, Helen Thomas sent to Poland.
[01:08:36.288 --> 01:08:45.315]  Remember she said there shouldn't be any Jews in the Middle East, in Israel, or in the surrounding Palestine?
[01:08:45.315 --> 01:08:47.877]  And she's now retired.
[01:08:47.877 --> 01:08:58.585]  She could hardly talk in the little video piece she did about, you know, Jews need to go back to Poland and Germany.
[01:08:58.585 --> 01:09:02.348]  So, remember David Brinkley kind of flipped out on TV?
[01:09:02.348 --> 01:09:04.270]  And then he retired and a few months later was dead?
[01:09:06.633 --> 01:09:10.135]  Helen Thomas retires in the world of political journalism.
[01:09:10.135 --> 01:09:10.996]  It's the end of an era.
[01:09:10.996 --> 01:09:15.539]  Helen Thomas has retired just months shy of her 90th birthday.
[01:09:15.539 --> 01:09:26.486]  The longtime White House journalist has covered every president since Dwight Eisenhower and broke several barriers for female journalists, but stepped down from her latest role, economist, for Hearst Newspapers.
[01:09:26.486 --> 01:09:28.087]  That means she was about to get fired.
[01:09:28.087 --> 01:09:29.108]  They said, retire or you're fired.
[01:09:30.441 --> 01:09:47.970]  In the wake of the controversial remarks made in late May about the need for Jews to get the hell out of Palestine and return to Poland and Germany, Helen Thomas announced Monday that she is retiring, effective immediately, wrote a statement from her newspapers on Monday, and the Speakers Bureau she was part of got rid of her too.
[01:09:47.970 --> 01:09:54.733]  Her decision came after her controversial comments about Israel and the Palestinians were captured on videotape and widely disseminated on the Internet.
[01:09:54.733 --> 01:09:55.234]  You know what?
[01:09:55.934 --> 01:09:59.635]  I'm against her being fired or her resigning.
[01:09:59.635 --> 01:10:06.858]  Just like, at the end of the day, I'm against the Texas Film Commission pulling funding for the film Machete.
[01:10:06.858 --> 01:10:18.963]  Whether you agree with something or disagree with it, it's just dangerous in this age of censorship to see people punished for what they say, especially when the government's announcing they want to shut down everybody's free speech.
[01:10:18.963 --> 01:10:22.364]  You know, the media made a big deal out of the YouTube video and
[01:10:26.371 --> 01:10:26.771]  Sure thing, Alex.
[01:10:26.771 --> 01:10:28.132]  Clearly, we're in the midst of a major paradigm shift.
[01:10:28.132 --> 01:10:28.612]  It's so exciting to see
[01:10:54.719 --> 01:11:01.982]  Three Bilderberg articles linked up prominently on Drudge with a photo of an anti-NWO banner.
[01:11:01.982 --> 01:11:07.905]  Um, I was calling to see, have you heard about this Cartoon Network show that did a fluoride propaganda episode last night?
[01:11:08.650 --> 01:11:25.405]  No, but they now admit that almost all TV, fiction and non-fiction, is government-financed brainwashing, and everything I see is pro-fluoride, pro-microchips, pro-warrantless blood-taking, just in kids' show after kids' show.
[01:11:25.405 --> 01:11:29.789]  The mailman will show up and say, I need blood to give you the mail, and they give him a little prick and it's fun.
[01:11:29.789 --> 01:11:30.710]  You know, they like...
[01:11:33.031 --> 01:11:34.572]  Tell me about the program.
[01:11:54.130 --> 01:11:56.632]  It's called Squid Billies.
[01:11:56.632 --> 01:12:03.297]  Basically, it's, you know, these talking octopi, the characters or caricatures of redneck hillbillies.
[01:12:03.297 --> 01:12:16.427]  In the episode, one of the squid billies holds an anti-water fluoridation protest where he gives a speech and he says, quote, Barack Hussein Obama is putting fluoride in our drinking water to sterilize our testicles.
[01:12:16.427 --> 01:12:18.509]  And as a result of the speech, all the squid billies
[01:12:18.888 --> 01:12:23.973]  They go down to the river and discharge their shotguns into the river, you know, to kill the fluoride.
[01:12:23.973 --> 01:12:29.099]  And then as a result of killing the fluoride, all of their teeth rot and fall out.
[01:12:29.099 --> 01:12:31.561]  I mean, really, you're kidding.
[01:12:31.561 --> 01:12:33.403]  They actually aired that?
[01:12:33.403 --> 01:12:34.064]  I couldn't believe it.
[01:12:34.064 --> 01:12:35.125]  It blew my mind.
[01:12:35.125 --> 01:12:37.287]  Well, will somebody get it and put it up on YouTube?
[01:12:37.287 --> 01:12:38.509]  We'll get a blurb up.
[01:12:38.509 --> 01:12:40.130]  All this is going to do is wake people up.
[01:12:43.078 --> 01:12:48.802]  Statistically, almost, I mean literally, with the last 5, 6, 7, 8, I haven't seen them lose.
[01:12:48.802 --> 01:12:50.643]  It's become big national news.
[01:12:50.643 --> 01:12:53.926]  Every international spelling bee is being won by U.S.
[01:12:53.926 --> 01:12:55.126]  homeschoolers.
[01:12:55.126 --> 01:12:55.867]  Here's the U.S.
[01:12:55.867 --> 01:12:56.387]  behind it.
[01:12:56.387 --> 01:13:06.615]  Every industrialized country for education, but number one, winning all the international spelling bees, geography bees, science fairs, and math quizzes.
[01:13:07.435 --> 01:13:17.057]  I mean, literally, last time I saw it a few years ago, it was six or seven times in a row, homeschoolers had won the International Spelling Bee, but it doesn't matter.
[01:13:17.057 --> 01:13:28.700]  I've been in a Dillard's, and I don't go shopping more than once or twice a year, and I was in a Skechers buying a pair of boots, motorcycle boots, years ago, and saw
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:38.204]  Uh, homeschooled, spelled wrong, with an image of an Airstream trailer on the front.
[01:13:38.204 --> 01:13:52.213]  And so you got these fluoride, Prozac-head kids, who don't know how to read and write public school, but they know how to act cool and get sexually transmitted diseases, and how to snort cocaine, and how to take Ritalin, and then they go buy shirts making fun of the homeschoolers.
[01:13:52.213 --> 01:13:54.154]  So, that's basically what's going on.
[01:13:54.854 --> 01:14:03.200]  And that's just another example, and I do see it in movies and TV, where the idiot, crazy child abuser is against vaccines and water fluoridation.
[01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:13.728]  So, the squid billies are evil creatures that shoot shotguns at the water, believing that can kill the fluoride, and they know that Barack Obama wants to destroy their... Well, I mean, you know what?
[01:14:13.728 --> 01:14:15.610]  What's funny is, you can print off
[01:14:16.090 --> 01:14:31.309]  Literally hundreds of articles a year where they admit that suddenly most the frogs and fish are sterile in reservoirs that have treated water being dumped into them because of the fluoride and the birth control runoff, you know, that is passed through women.
[01:14:31.309 --> 01:14:34.213]  So I guess, you know, really the squid billies are sterile.
[01:14:35.274 --> 01:14:37.775]  Uh, but, uh, oh, so all their teeth fall out.
[01:14:37.775 --> 01:14:46.459]  I mean, that is, of course, now the American Dental Association recommends children under six don't brush with it because it causes dental ferocious and weakening of the teeth and bone cancer.
[01:14:46.459 --> 01:14:51.102]  Uh, but I mean, I tell you, Curry, is this not desperate?
[01:14:51.102 --> 01:14:51.782]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:14:51.782 --> 01:14:56.684]  I mean, it's so obvious that the tide has turned in the Infowar, Alex.
[01:14:56.684 --> 01:14:58.465]  Um, everybody's waking up.
[01:14:58.465 --> 01:15:00.286]  I mean, of course it's desperate.
[01:15:00.286 --> 01:15:01.967]  Um, just look at the billboard coverage right now.
[01:15:01.967 --> 01:15:02.487]  It's incredible.
[01:15:03.618 --> 01:15:04.758]  Yeah, look at the Drudge Report.
[01:15:04.758 --> 01:15:07.139]  It says, uh, down with your New World Order.
[01:15:07.139 --> 01:15:08.480]  In fact, I don't have the Drudge Report up.
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:11.081]  What's the, what's the white sign in Spanish say exactly?
[01:15:11.081 --> 01:15:14.442]  Oh, I must have already let him go.
[01:15:14.442 --> 01:15:15.142]  Here, let me load it.
[01:15:15.142 --> 01:15:18.864]  I don't want to give out wrong information.
[01:15:18.864 --> 01:15:23.086]  Uh, here we go.
[01:15:23.086 --> 01:15:24.106]  Oh, they just pulled it.
[01:15:26.735 --> 01:15:28.317]  They just pulled the articles.
[01:15:28.317 --> 01:15:29.798]  He just changed it.
[01:15:29.798 --> 01:15:32.701]  Since Friday he's had two of my articles up.
[01:15:32.701 --> 01:15:34.242]  But I guess Bilderberg is over now.
[01:15:34.242 --> 01:15:34.603]  He had a...
[01:15:37.259 --> 01:15:50.914]  If you want to see a screenshot of it, you can go to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, and I shot a video this weekend that Aaron Dykes edited that did a great job on, Burning the Midnight Oil, titled, Alex Jones, Bilderberg Group, Running Scared.
[01:15:50.914 --> 01:15:56.901]  We have a screenshot of it, but I believe it said in Spanish, no to the Bilderberg Group, or no to world government.
[01:15:56.901 --> 01:15:57.982]  No, no to the New World Order.
[01:15:57.982 --> 01:15:58.383]  What did it say?
[01:16:02.193 --> 01:16:03.434]  Oh yeah, we have the sign now.
[01:16:03.434 --> 01:16:06.336]  It says, Stop the New World Order.
[01:16:06.336 --> 01:16:10.298]  Another sign says, No to the New World Order, Stop Bilderberg Assassins.
[01:16:10.298 --> 01:16:11.719]  So there's a whole bunch of signs.
[01:16:11.719 --> 01:16:14.301]  But I mean specifically the sign they had up on Drudge.
[01:16:14.301 --> 01:16:15.702]  Doesn't matter.
[01:16:15.702 --> 01:16:16.642]  Pointless factoid.
[01:16:17.623 --> 01:16:20.164]  It's just that Drudge had that up on his site.
[01:16:20.164 --> 01:16:21.324]  It's over!
[01:16:21.324 --> 01:16:25.946]  You can't tell us there's no international bankers selling derivatives to destroy our economy.
[01:16:25.946 --> 01:16:28.187]  We have the Goldman Sachs emails.
[01:16:28.187 --> 01:16:29.427]  We have them.
[01:16:29.427 --> 01:16:35.730]  But more than that, the public all heard me seven, eight years ago calling out Goldman Sachs selling the derivatives.
[01:16:35.730 --> 01:16:37.530]  I mean, it's over, okay?
[01:16:37.530 --> 01:16:38.631]  We have total credibility.
[01:16:40.346 --> 01:16:50.753]  And that twit Chris Matthews is going to have some distorted hit piece on the 16th, coming up in eight days, nine days, demonizing Rand Paul and myself.
[01:16:50.753 --> 01:16:56.417]  Rand Paul's poll numbers went up when you said he was a racist wearing Nazi underwear.
[01:16:56.417 --> 01:16:58.398]  Everyone knows you're full of baloney.
[01:16:58.398 --> 01:17:01.440]  You get up there and say, I don't want government health care because I'm a racist?
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:01.681]  What?
[01:17:02.501 --> 01:17:03.582]  That's asinine!
[01:17:03.582 --> 01:17:04.062]  Good!
[01:17:04.062 --> 01:17:05.082]  Keep it up!
[01:17:05.082 --> 01:17:06.983]  More lies, more propaganda.
[01:17:06.983 --> 01:17:08.324]  We'll keep telling the truth.
[01:17:08.324 --> 01:17:09.205]  We'll see who wins.
[01:17:09.205 --> 01:17:11.746]  Well, they're coming and trying to restrict free speech now.
[01:17:11.746 --> 01:17:13.447]  They're panicking.
[01:17:13.447 --> 01:17:15.508]  Rudy in North Carolina, then Eric, Tim, and others.
[01:17:15.508 --> 01:17:17.929]  Rudy, welcome.
[01:17:17.929 --> 01:17:18.970]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:17:18.970 --> 01:17:20.010]  I'm doing well, sir.
[01:17:20.010 --> 01:17:20.831]  Thank you for calling.
[01:17:20.831 --> 01:17:24.573]  Real quick, I live in Charlotte, North Carolina, Mecklenburg County.
[01:17:24.573 --> 01:17:30.696]  About a month ago, the Board of Commissioners was saying how if you live outside the city of Charlotte,
[01:17:31.312 --> 01:17:36.453]  And within Mecklenburg County, the police department will not come to your call.
[01:17:36.453 --> 01:17:36.953]  That's right.
[01:17:36.953 --> 01:17:43.775]  All over the country, they're laying off 144 cops down to 42.
[01:17:43.775 --> 01:17:45.236]  That was a case in Pennsylvania.
[01:17:45.236 --> 01:17:46.816]  Another case in Ohio.
[01:17:46.816 --> 01:17:54.198]  Literally, the police have announced that they're going to stop responding to real crime in most areas and only write tickets.
[01:17:54.198 --> 01:17:56.438]  They're only there to get money.
[01:17:56.438 --> 01:17:56.979]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:17:59.266 --> 01:18:11.013]  That Mayor Fox said that other communities will not be able to use our helicopters, won't be able to use the crime units, facilities, anything like that.
[01:18:11.013 --> 01:18:23.080]  Also Alex, if people go to the October 2009 issue of Popular Science, page 34, at the bottom of the page you'll see that General Electric are making refrigerators
[01:18:23.590 --> 01:18:29.075]  Microwaves and everything that's being tested in Kentucky that the government will be able to shut down all your appliances.
[01:18:29.075 --> 01:18:30.416]  So, it's in writing.
[01:18:30.416 --> 01:18:32.878]  So, if they go to the library, look at popular science...
[01:18:38.075 --> 01:18:39.055]  Well, do me a favor.
[01:18:39.055 --> 01:18:44.437]  Will you photocopy that and send it to me, or email me the actual date, because that's useful?
[01:18:44.437 --> 01:18:48.058]  But I'm telling you, I have no exaggeration over 15 years on air.
[01:18:48.058 --> 01:18:52.159]  I have seen more than 100 government documents and news articles.
[01:18:52.159 --> 01:18:57.501]  I saw one last week, where all new refrigerators by law, all washing machines, everything.
[01:18:57.501 --> 01:19:01.143]  They're phasing it in, just like they can tell you what type of light bulb, what type of toilet.
[01:19:01.143 --> 01:19:02.043]  That's to set the precedent.
[01:19:02.623 --> 01:19:27.191]  Everything will be remote controlled and get this through the power because they can now send commands It's called data over transmission line through the power cord And and and I have I would guess that report talks about that the power cord has a switch in it that recognizes data and so everything is going to surveil you and already the power of
[01:19:27.851 --> 01:19:29.794]  Already the power boxes are doing it.
[01:19:29.794 --> 01:19:31.577]  Already all the new big air conditioners.
[01:19:31.577 --> 01:19:34.682]  I mean, all of them are coming out with remote control.
[01:19:34.682 --> 01:19:35.624]  The compressors.
[01:19:35.624 --> 01:19:40.271]  I mean, is this not crazy, Rudy?
[01:19:40.271 --> 01:19:40.832]  Rudy, you gone?
[01:19:43.573 --> 01:19:44.654]  I know, he hung up.
[01:19:44.654 --> 01:19:47.056]  Rudy, email it to ShowTipsAtInfoWars.com.
[01:19:47.056 --> 01:19:48.918]  I'm so glad you called about that.
[01:19:48.918 --> 01:19:50.539]  Folks, we're not making any of this up.
[01:19:50.539 --> 01:19:52.441]  It's total prison.
[01:19:52.441 --> 01:19:54.963]  Everything's being turned into a prison.
[01:19:54.963 --> 01:19:56.785]  And they're going to raise taxes.
[01:19:56.785 --> 01:19:57.946]  They're not going to fix the roads.
[01:19:57.946 --> 01:19:59.507]  They're going to get rid of the cops.
[01:19:59.507 --> 01:20:00.348]  It's just going to be hell.
[01:20:02.165 --> 01:20:02.925]  The problem.
[01:20:02.925 --> 01:20:05.506]  How do I cook food without power?
[01:20:05.506 --> 01:20:08.207]  How do I light my home with no electricity?
[01:20:08.207 --> 01:20:10.888]  How do I get emergency radio broadcast?
[01:20:10.888 --> 01:20:13.389]  How can I make safe drinking water?

[01:23:02.690 --> 01:23:04.031]  Allergies and asthma.
[01:23:04.031 --> 01:23:05.471]  Chronic disease.
[01:23:05.471 --> 01:23:07.312]  Is your home making you sick?
[01:23:07.312 --> 01:23:08.252]  Here's a fact.
[01:23:08.252 --> 01:23:10.293]  Our indoor air quality is getting worse.
[01:23:10.293 --> 01:23:16.234]  And the causes include chemicals, toxic gases, dust, pollen, dander, and even chemtrail particulates.

[01:24:24.782 --> 01:24:31.783]  Folks, you're supposed to be ranting and raving about tyranny.
[01:24:31.783 --> 01:24:34.844]  You're supposed to be upset about it.
[01:24:34.844 --> 01:24:36.124]  Yes, everything.
[01:24:36.124 --> 01:24:40.945]  All cell phones, all clock radios, all microwaves.
[01:24:40.945 --> 01:24:44.886]  Everything is being designed now to be government remote controlled.
[01:24:44.886 --> 01:24:46.846]  They're phasing it in over the next four years.
[01:24:48.445 --> 01:24:53.547]  Depending on what appliance it is, within four years, everything will be government remote controlled.
[01:24:53.547 --> 01:24:57.429]  And your clock radio will turn on and give you warnings.
[01:24:57.429 --> 01:25:00.010]  Oh, the tornado's coming!
[01:25:00.010 --> 01:25:02.011]  And your TV will turn on and give you orders.
[01:25:02.011 --> 01:25:05.433]  You're going to get auto-dial calls from Homeland Security.
[01:25:05.433 --> 01:25:06.573]  That's already started.
[01:25:06.573 --> 01:25:10.295]  You're going to get weekly visits in your neighborhood by the Green Police.
[01:25:10.295 --> 01:25:12.236]  I mean, you want to be a slave?
[01:25:12.236 --> 01:25:15.457]  You got it!
[01:25:15.457 --> 01:25:16.197]  I shouldn't laugh.
[01:25:16.197 --> 01:25:17.058]  It's just so sick.
[01:25:18.539 --> 01:25:22.063]  Oh, heaven help us.
[01:25:22.063 --> 01:25:23.744]  Heaven help us.
[01:25:23.744 --> 01:25:27.568]  And there's going to be unlimited money for surveillance and SWAT teams.
[01:25:27.568 --> 01:25:30.391]  No money when you get mugged.
[01:25:30.391 --> 01:25:33.014]  No cops.
[01:25:33.014 --> 01:25:35.776]  When your house gets burglarized, they're not coming.
[01:25:35.776 --> 01:25:40.821]  Just like they don't come in most cities to car accidents now unless they've got to get it off the road.
[01:25:41.806 --> 01:25:43.847]  It's like they don't come and your car gets stolen.
[01:25:43.847 --> 01:25:46.127]  Hell, I had a car stolen in Dallas 15 years ago.
[01:25:46.127 --> 01:25:47.587]  The cops wouldn't come.
[01:25:47.587 --> 01:25:53.609]  And I politely hung up on 9-1-1 and they showed up with guns out saying, you don't hang up until we say you can, boy.
[01:25:53.609 --> 01:25:56.170]  And I said, yes, sir!
[01:25:56.170 --> 01:25:57.470]  I'm a scum American!
[01:25:57.470 --> 01:25:58.250]  Yes, sir!
[01:25:58.250 --> 01:25:58.890]  I'm scum!
[01:25:58.890 --> 01:25:59.671]  You're a god!
[01:25:59.671 --> 01:26:01.331]  I'm scum!
[01:26:01.331 --> 01:26:02.351]  That's basically what happened.
[01:26:02.351 --> 01:26:03.511]  All right, I'm going to settle down now.
[01:26:03.511 --> 01:26:04.392]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[01:26:06.005 --> 01:26:07.486]  Oh boy.
[01:26:07.486 --> 01:26:10.869]  World stocks hit by fears over U.S.
[01:26:10.869 --> 01:26:13.591]  jobs and Hungary plunging.
[01:26:13.591 --> 01:26:13.891]  U.S.
[01:26:13.891 --> 01:26:19.095]  13 trillion debt poised to overtake GDP have more debt than the entire gross domestic product.
[01:26:19.095 --> 01:26:21.117]  That's called being slaves.
[01:26:21.117 --> 01:26:21.918]  Oh, there's the headline.
[01:26:21.918 --> 01:26:26.541]  Bilderberg's 2010 New World Order.
[01:26:26.541 --> 01:26:28.923]  Drudge just put the headline back up.
[01:26:28.923 --> 01:26:29.904]  I've never seen Drudge do that.
[01:26:29.904 --> 01:26:31.105]  Take headlines down, put them back up.
[01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:33.460]  Well, thank you, Matt.
[01:26:33.460 --> 01:26:34.061]  We appreciate it.
[01:26:34.061 --> 01:26:37.882]  Well, Matt, I have heard, has listened to the show.
[01:26:37.882 --> 01:26:47.547]  Bilderberg 2010, Between the Sword and the Wall, and then it's got our final list of participants from PrisonPlanet.com on it, and it says, Stop the New World Order!
[01:26:47.547 --> 01:26:49.327]  That's what he has up on the Drudge Report.
[01:26:49.327 --> 01:26:50.208]  How do you like that?
[01:26:51.491 --> 01:26:55.212]  By the way, Rob Doo just came into the office.
[01:26:55.212 --> 01:26:59.973]  He confirms that he has that TV show about the squid people.
[01:26:59.973 --> 01:27:01.914]  I guess it's his favorite program.
[01:27:01.914 --> 01:27:05.855]  And he taped it.
[01:27:05.855 --> 01:27:08.396]  I think I've even seen that channel surfing.
[01:27:08.396 --> 01:27:12.677]  And yes, you are a toothless piece of trash if you don't want to drink fluoride.
[01:27:12.677 --> 01:27:15.458]  Doesn't matter it's a deadly poison, just shut up and drink it.
[01:27:15.458 --> 01:27:19.859]  Hey, why don't you tell Doo to get a camera hooked up and I'll shoot like a one minute
[01:27:20.956 --> 01:27:22.639]  I mean, again, is that a free society?
[01:27:35.683 --> 01:27:37.124]  Is that a free society?
[01:27:37.124 --> 01:27:40.486]  When they take your baby's blood at birth without asking and put it in the Pentagon database?
[01:27:40.486 --> 01:27:43.288]  When they face scan you walking down the street and license plates scan you?
[01:27:43.288 --> 01:27:45.790]  When they take blood at checkpoints without warrants?
[01:27:45.790 --> 01:27:50.914]  When they naked body scan you and save it and make fun of your naked body on record now and admit it?
[01:27:50.914 --> 01:27:56.978]  When they remote control the appliances in your house and your thermostat and your air conditioner and your water?
[01:27:56.978 --> 01:27:58.760]  Is that freedom?
[01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:01.441]  Is it freedom when every facet of your life is run by government?
[01:28:01.441 --> 01:28:02.502]  No.
[01:28:02.502 --> 01:28:03.343]  No, it's Big Brother.
[01:28:04.673 --> 01:28:06.855]  And look at gold, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:06.855 --> 01:28:09.537]  Gold went up $20 today.
[01:28:09.537 --> 01:28:09.557]  $20.
[01:28:09.557 --> 01:28:19.864]  And it's been gyrating between $20 and $15 as the globalists try to go in and drive down the price of gold.
[01:28:19.864 --> 01:28:21.005]  Let's see where it is right now.
[01:28:22.888 --> 01:28:28.593]  It's up $19.10, so it was up $20, went down to $18, going back up to $20.
[01:28:28.593 --> 01:28:34.358]  That's in one day, a $19 plus increase on the yellow medal.
[01:28:34.358 --> 01:28:35.118]  And why?
[01:28:35.118 --> 01:28:38.301]  Because they gave them $160 billion, did nothing in Europe.
[01:28:38.301 --> 01:28:43.065]  They gave them a trillion, they gave them $2 trillion, nothing works.
[01:28:43.065 --> 01:28:45.347]  It's like saying the drug war isn't working.
[01:28:45.347 --> 01:28:49.591]  The bigger the drug war gets, the more drugs are on our streets, the more people in prison.
[01:28:49.591 --> 01:28:50.812]  It's working wonderfully!
[01:28:53.117 --> 01:28:56.989]  That's like saying, oh, Hitler's killing all these people, it's not working!
[01:28:56.989 --> 01:28:58.674]  And Hitler's like, no!
[01:28:58.674 --> 01:28:59.657]  It's working quite well!
[01:29:01.820 --> 01:29:02.981]  You expect me to talk?
[01:29:02.981 --> 01:29:04.783]  No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!
[01:29:04.783 --> 01:29:06.744]  You understand that?
[01:29:06.744 --> 01:29:09.106]  They want to implode the economy.
[01:29:09.106 --> 01:29:11.328]  This is what they've done in the third world over and over again.
[01:29:11.328 --> 01:29:13.150]  They're doing it by design.
[01:29:13.150 --> 01:29:17.294]  Now, the euro, they wanted to just rob nation by nation.
[01:29:17.294 --> 01:29:26.802]  But the fact that they're so greedy, that they can't even control their own speculators, and that Europe is fully imploding, is endangering their whole apple cart.
[01:29:26.802 --> 01:29:28.664]  Because we're there exposing them.
[01:29:30.458 --> 01:29:32.280]  So you think stuff's bad now, folks?
[01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:34.281]  It's only going to get worse.
[01:29:34.281 --> 01:29:36.743]  We're going to cover some financial news that is vital.
[01:29:36.743 --> 01:29:38.365]  Then we're going to Romania.
[01:29:38.365 --> 01:29:43.689]  Paul Dornanu, who just got back from Bilderberg, he'll tell us what happened on Saturday and Sunday.
[01:29:43.689 --> 01:29:51.416]  We'll get a quick little 10-minute report from him, then more of your calls and tons of geopolitical vital news straight ahead.
[01:29:51.416 --> 01:29:52.817]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.817 --> 01:29:55.339]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.339 --> 01:29:58.021]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.926 --> 01:30:10.391]  With the implementation of Codex Alimentarius, it is clear that we must act quickly to avoid losing our freedom of choice where personal health preferences are concerned.
[01:30:10.391 --> 01:30:21.298]  As of January 1, 2010, Codex Alimentarius was implemented within the European Union, resulting in the restricted sale of many natural supplements, including colloidal silver.
[01:30:21.298 --> 01:30:26.722]  We must take immediate steps to assure a continuing supply of colloidal silver for ourselves and our families.
[01:30:27.282 --> 01:30:32.165]  Act now to acquire the means of producing this beneficial supplement in the privacy of your own home.
[01:30:32.165 --> 01:30:41.231]  Colloidal Silver is a powerful antipathogenic used for more than 200 years as a natural alternative to costly drugs and their dangerous, unpredictable side effects.
[01:30:41.231 --> 01:30:51.358]  Go to www.silverlungs.com for more information on how to secure your freedom of choice by producing your own Colloidal Silver right from home.
[01:30:51.358 --> 01:30:55.041]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:30:55.041 --> 01:30:56.061]  Silverlungs.com.
[01:31:00.472 --> 01:31:05.015]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:31:05.015 --> 01:31:05.936]  Number 1.
[01:31:05.936 --> 01:31:09.358]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:31:09.358 --> 01:31:10.219]  Number 2.
[01:31:10.219 --> 01:31:15.102]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:31:15.102 --> 01:31:15.842]  It's true.
[01:31:15.842 --> 01:31:20.726]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:20.726 --> 01:31:21.546]  Number 3.
[01:31:21.546 --> 01:31:25.128]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:31:25.128 --> 01:31:28.831]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:31:29.031 --> 01:31:29.831]  Number 4.
[01:31:29.831 --> 01:31:32.592]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:31:32.592 --> 01:31:36.274]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:31:36.274 --> 01:31:37.054]  Number 5.
[01:31:37.054 --> 01:31:41.216]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:31:41.216 --> 01:31:46.258]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:31:46.258 --> 01:31:50.439]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:50.439 --> 01:31:52.220]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:52.220 --> 01:31:56.822]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[01:31:57.762 --> 01:32:00.664]  877-327-0365.
[01:32:00.664 --> 01:32:07.329]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:32:07.329 --> 01:32:12.472]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:32:12.472 --> 01:32:21.198]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:32:21.198 --> 01:32:23.380]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:32:25.270 --> 01:32:27.557]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[01:32:29.694 --> 01:32:34.278]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[01:32:34.278 --> 01:32:38.141]  Blue Diamond Gussets, got it.
[01:32:38.141 --> 01:32:39.342]  Others don't.
[01:32:39.342 --> 01:32:41.504]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:32:41.504 --> 01:32:43.285]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:32:43.285 --> 01:32:46.167]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:32:46.167 --> 01:32:52.793]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:32:52.793 --> 01:32:55.495]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:32:55.495 --> 01:32:57.877]  Diamond Gusset Jeans, got it.
[01:32:57.877 --> 01:32:58.357]  Others don't.
[01:33:05.267 --> 01:33:22.424]  There's a gun and ammunition Just inside the doorway Use it only in emergency Better you should pray to God
[01:33:25.134 --> 01:33:28.657]  Well, my friends, you don't want to miss the last hour today and tomorrow.
[01:33:28.657 --> 01:33:33.161]  It'll be Paul Watson's maiden voyage from England, co-hosting the show.
[01:33:33.161 --> 01:33:38.786]  I'm going to throw him in the deep end and let him do the last hour live by himself.
[01:33:38.786 --> 01:33:41.969]  Of course, Watson is a veteran news reporter for a decade.
[01:33:42.609 --> 01:33:42.989]  I think?
[01:34:06.896 --> 01:34:11.460]  Uh, his red coat excellency, uh, coming on in the, uh, last hour today.
[01:34:11.460 --> 01:34:21.430]  And we do have people popping in also from Bilderberg 2010, like Paul Dornanew coming up here in just a few minutes, uh, because, uh, our last reports were on Friday.
[01:34:21.430 --> 01:34:23.351]  We got Tucker coming on in a couple days.
[01:34:23.351 --> 01:34:26.294]  He's flying back today from, uh, Sigis, Spain.
[01:34:27.515 --> 01:34:27.695]  I think?
[01:34:49.707 --> 01:34:50.908]  So I don't know how many articles there are.
[01:34:50.908 --> 01:34:59.635]  I know you Google the term Bilderberg, and you put it in different search functions, and it's hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of articles that you just see right there on the surface.
[01:34:59.635 --> 01:35:02.657]  So there's a complete implosion of their operation.
[01:35:02.657 --> 01:35:10.603]  The problem is they're going to try to launch a war with Iran as a political distraction, and that comes directly from the Bilderberg group's sources.
[01:35:10.603 --> 01:35:13.105]  People say, oh, well, you know, what are your sources?
[01:35:13.105 --> 01:35:17.529]  Well, in media we can't give you our sources, but they have a lot of secretaries, they have a lot of
[01:35:18.109 --> 01:35:21.432]  Financial planners, they have a lot of people that work with them.
[01:35:21.432 --> 01:35:26.077]  There's also guests and there's senatorial aides and people like that.
[01:35:28.231 --> 01:35:31.552]  Okay, I mean, look at the track record of the info Tucker's gotten.
[01:35:31.552 --> 01:35:32.992]  It's gold.
[01:35:32.992 --> 01:35:35.333]  Jim Tucker's for real.
[01:35:35.333 --> 01:35:40.294]  Look at how many predictions he's made that have happened, unfortunately, via the info he got from Bilderberg.
[01:35:40.294 --> 01:35:42.834]  We wish that they weren't in power.
[01:35:42.834 --> 01:35:51.496]  We wish that they didn't have, not complete control, but they're able to steer and twist world events, in many cases, the way they want.
[01:35:51.496 --> 01:35:54.077]  Until now, they're having more and more failures.
[01:35:55.766 --> 01:36:04.315]  Because you are taking action and we are revealing them, and the people that say we're kooks because there's a world government run by bankers, they look like lying kooks now.
[01:36:04.315 --> 01:36:11.822]  The people that say fluoride's good for you, or mercury's good for you, or vaccines are good, people are now reading the vaccine inserts and finding out they're being lied to.
[01:36:12.603 --> 01:36:18.667]  And they can have shows for kids like squid billies, where fluoride's good for you and your toothless hillbillies if you don't drink it.
[01:36:18.667 --> 01:36:20.388]  That's only going to wake adults up.
[01:36:20.388 --> 01:36:21.228]  It's over!
[01:36:21.228 --> 01:36:21.969]  Okay?
[01:36:21.969 --> 01:36:23.830]  It's over if we just take action.
[01:36:23.830 --> 01:36:25.751]  Yes, the globalists are going to stage terror.
[01:36:25.751 --> 01:36:27.532]  Yes, they're going to try to shut down the internet.
[01:36:27.532 --> 01:36:29.353]  Yes, they're going to bring in police states.
[01:36:29.353 --> 01:36:32.756]  But at least the battle's joined, and we know they're not invincible.
[01:36:32.756 --> 01:36:36.198]  And we've shown people they're not invincible, and if we just take action, it's over.
[01:36:36.858 --> 01:36:39.899]  It's over if you get up off your butts.
[01:36:39.899 --> 01:36:46.882]  If we all collectively get off our enormous butts and do something, we can change history here for the better.
[01:36:46.882 --> 01:36:53.144]  The other alternative is degradation and slavery of a high-tech version we've never seen before.
[01:36:53.144 --> 01:36:54.765]  Let me tell you, it ain't pretty.
[01:36:54.765 --> 01:36:55.045]  Okay.
[01:36:55.973 --> 01:36:57.254]  Now here's the deal.
[01:36:57.254 --> 01:37:01.456]  Gold is up almost $20 today.
[01:37:01.456 --> 01:37:03.898]  The bankers about an hour ago tried to drive it down.
[01:37:03.898 --> 01:37:05.058]  It failed.
[01:37:05.058 --> 01:37:06.979]  It's at an all-time high today right now.
[01:37:06.979 --> 01:37:09.681]  An hour ago they tried to drive it down.
[01:37:09.681 --> 01:37:17.866]  It's come out in congressional hearings that JP Morgan especially is trying to fix the gold price, but they're failing because Europe is basically sold out of gold.
[01:37:17.866 --> 01:37:20.387]  They're reporting their mints are sold out.
[01:37:20.387 --> 01:37:21.828]  The pawn shops are sold out.
[01:37:21.828 --> 01:37:23.009]  Premiums are exploding.
[01:37:23.909 --> 01:37:32.117]  And I wanted to briefly bring Ted Anderson up before we go to Paul Dornanoo joining us from Romania, because Ted, you've got some other news headlines for us on the economy.
[01:37:32.117 --> 01:37:44.128]  Bloomberg's reporting with their chart yesterday that made international news, that within just a few years, our GDP will be less, our gross domestic product, everything we make, will be less than the debt.
[01:37:45.103 --> 01:37:51.348]  So, the bankers set up fractional reserve banking, so it's physically impossible to ever pay it back.
[01:37:51.348 --> 01:37:58.174]  It's made up, we either say no to the fraud, or we're done for.
[01:37:58.174 --> 01:38:02.078]  And as long as we get that message out so people have an alternative, we can bring these people down.
[01:38:02.078 --> 01:38:11.906]  But I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up, 31 years in the gold and silver business, 14 years with Midas Resources, or maybe even longer, and here he is joining us today.
[01:38:11.906 --> 01:38:12.707]  Ted, thanks for coming on.
[01:38:13.112 --> 01:38:14.754]  Yeah, hey, thanks for having me up, Alex.
[01:38:14.754 --> 01:38:16.635]  And the way you said it is exactly right.
[01:38:16.635 --> 01:38:25.663]  There was a sell-off this morning, but all those losses were erased immediately, and now we're about $10 away from the all-time peak for gold.
[01:38:25.663 --> 01:38:26.283]  In the U.S.
[01:38:26.283 --> 01:38:27.224]  dollar, I should say.
[01:38:27.224 --> 01:38:29.046]  It's already the all-time peak in Europe.
[01:38:29.306 --> 01:38:31.347]  Yeah, it's already in the all-time pick in Europe.
[01:38:31.347 --> 01:38:36.328]  We've seen $12.41 already today, and currently right now trading at $12.40.
[01:38:36.328 --> 01:38:38.409]  I mean, Reuters is writing about it.
[01:38:38.409 --> 01:38:40.289]  I've seen the article in Bloomberg.
[01:38:40.289 --> 01:38:53.713]  The Hindu has a big article on gold and how the people in India are just buying gold, especially jewelry and bars.
[01:38:53.713 --> 01:38:56.194]  My wholesalers are out there in Europe right now trying to buy
[01:38:57.304 --> 01:38:57.985]  We're good to go.
[01:39:18.986 --> 01:39:24.549]  Right now, we're sitting in a position where it's hard to, you know, you have a hard time buying Krugerrands and Maple Leafs.
[01:39:24.549 --> 01:39:32.752]  I mean, the Krugerrand, the South African government turned up their production, and they're making it, you know, an increased 25% over their last high.
[01:39:32.752 --> 01:39:42.016]  And that shows that we have a fixed market, because when, you know, say in Venezuela when they fix the price of milk, and they claim that it's in U.S.
[01:39:42.016 --> 01:39:42.537]  conversion,
[01:39:43.337 --> 01:39:49.602]  You know, $3 per gallon, but you can't find it anywhere, so there's a black market where it's $8 a gallon.
[01:39:49.602 --> 01:39:50.863]  That's price fixing.
[01:39:50.863 --> 01:40:10.200]  So they say gold is $1,239, up $19.30 today, but in reality, it's sold out, and there's giant premiums, so the market is showing that gold is really closer to $1,500 an ounce right now, but Ted Anderson, being the free marketeer that he is, and the patriot,
[01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:23.045]  He bought gold and silver when it was over a hundred dollars lower, and he's still selling it to you, but he's almost sold out of everything, and then the price will go up, so do not screw around.
[01:40:23.045 --> 01:40:25.646]  Ted, explain this to people and give folks today's offer.
[01:40:25.646 --> 01:40:26.686]  Sure, I will.
[01:40:26.686 --> 01:40:27.346]  Absolutely.
[01:40:27.346 --> 01:40:30.867]  Right now, the Walking Liberty half is still at $9.75.
[01:40:30.867 --> 01:40:34.009]  That was the same exact price we talked about last week.
[01:40:34.009 --> 01:40:37.550]  The only coin that's edged up a little bit here is that frank, and
[01:40:38.710 --> 01:40:44.194]  My traders are saying that this coin has to be up in the $2.70 range, and I said, no, we're not going to do that.
[01:40:44.194 --> 01:40:49.477]  We picked them up to $2.65, but I got to tell you, there's so much pressure on that market.
[01:40:49.477 --> 01:40:54.300]  Right now I'm hoping, I'm hoping to get a good supply of the British Sovereign again.
[01:40:54.300 --> 01:40:55.381]  We've sold just a
[01:40:56.061 --> 01:41:02.025]  A ton of those things, and the people that bought them are sitting on nice profits now.
[01:41:02.025 --> 01:41:03.686]  You know, they really are sitting with nice income.
[01:41:03.686 --> 01:41:05.928]  Well, let's tell folks the coins you do have, though, Ted.
[01:41:05.928 --> 01:41:14.854]  Well, the ones that we have right now is going to be the Frank, and you get that one with the Forecaster, a full year subscription to Bob Chapman's newsletter at $265 a coin.
[01:41:14.854 --> 01:41:18.397]  But if somebody wants more than one coin, they can still get the $265 a piece.
[01:41:18.397 --> 01:41:19.177]  Yes, they can.
[01:41:19.177 --> 01:41:24.041]  They can buy as many as they want at this particular time, but I can't say that that's always going to occur.
[01:41:24.461 --> 01:41:29.965]  Because the Europeans are the ones that are buying the gold coins right now, and this is a European coin.
[01:41:29.965 --> 01:41:31.487]  I import them.
[01:41:31.487 --> 01:41:38.031]  You know, I have to deal with the competition of that market, and the premiums are starting to rise, just like you said earlier.
[01:41:38.031 --> 01:41:39.092]  Premiums on U.S.
[01:41:39.092 --> 01:41:46.198]  Eagles went up by $100 an ounce here just a couple years ago, when Hank Paulson and George Bush was calling for
[01:41:46.718 --> 01:41:49.442]  You know, for the TARP bailout.
[01:41:49.442 --> 01:41:53.448]  I mean, that's what's going on in Europe right now, and it's not gonna stop in Europe.
[01:41:53.448 --> 01:41:58.436]  It's coming right back home here to the United States, and we're gonna have problems just like that.
[01:41:58.436 --> 01:41:59.257]  And if people haven't...
[01:42:00.785 --> 01:42:06.490]  Come to their senses and decided to buy gold for their portfolio, I don't know how I can help them.
[01:42:06.490 --> 01:42:17.480]  I mean, Alex, I just need to tell you that $265 for a franc is going to look like a really, really good price later on because the market is moving away from that.
[01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:25.047]  And even though it's at a discounted price today, you know, you've got to realize that people are sitting in the stock market, the bonds, if you have an IRA put away,
[01:42:25.467 --> 01:42:27.629]  And you think that you're going to have something in the future.
[01:42:27.629 --> 01:42:28.991]  It's under attack.
[01:42:28.991 --> 01:42:39.822]  The United States dollar is not going to hold value as the Federal Reserve System turns on the printing presses and cranks out the debt machine and puts us in such hock.
[01:42:39.822 --> 01:42:45.708]  I mean, there's just no way that the United States dollar is going to fare well in that kind of an economy.
[01:42:45.708 --> 01:42:46.709]  You know, that environment.
[01:42:46.989 --> 01:42:52.292]  Ted, tell folks about some of the other coins that you do have in plentiful supply.
[01:42:52.292 --> 01:42:54.614]  How are you doing on those silver half-dollars?
[01:42:54.614 --> 01:42:56.675]  The silver half-dollars are there.
[01:42:56.675 --> 01:42:58.536]  You can buy as many as you want right now.
[01:42:58.536 --> 01:43:04.880]  I shouldn't say that because I don't know exactly what, you know, how many people will place orders on, but they are available right now.
[01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:06.441]  The junk silvers are a great buy.
[01:43:06.441 --> 01:43:15.266]  I was able to reduce the price on $20 Liberties even though the price went up in the gold market, you know, almost a 40-point fluctuation today.
[01:43:16.046 --> 01:43:18.427]  To $1,518 a piece.
[01:43:18.427 --> 01:43:19.367]  We have U.S.
[01:43:19.367 --> 01:43:20.188]  Eagles.
[01:43:20.188 --> 01:43:25.570]  I mean, there are many different coins that you can be buying in on and getting some good quantity in.
[01:43:25.570 --> 01:43:26.810]  But you know what?
[01:43:26.810 --> 01:43:34.933]  When this stuff comes from Europe and starts landing in the United States, this crisis that we're dealing with, it's not going to be pretty, Alex.
[01:43:34.933 --> 01:43:36.614]  All this stuff is going to go up.
[01:43:36.614 --> 01:43:40.295]  The premiums are going to have to rise because there's such demand right now.
[01:43:41.164 --> 01:43:43.605]  Yeah, I don't know how to say it any more clear than that.
[01:43:43.605 --> 01:43:49.169]  I mean, I'm not saying that gold can't fluctuate in price and be, you know, right now it's $1,240.
[01:43:49.169 --> 01:43:51.870]  It might reach a point of $1,220 again.
[01:43:51.870 --> 01:44:00.135]  But we hit that support level of $1,200 and the bankers tried to push it back down into that $1,180 range and they lost that battle.
[01:44:00.135 --> 01:44:01.095]  It went shooting up to $1,240.
[01:44:02.236 --> 01:44:06.257]  And this is happening in the summer when it's normally, historically, very low.
[01:44:06.257 --> 01:44:07.197]  800-686-2237.
[01:44:07.197 --> 01:44:10.998]  Don't procrastinate, folks.
[01:44:10.998 --> 01:44:11.218]  800-686-2237.
[01:44:11.218 --> 01:44:18.079]  The Broeckles will be there until later this evening.
[01:44:18.079 --> 01:44:20.660]  And Ted has had to go up a little bit on the francs.
[01:44:20.660 --> 01:44:22.860]  Still one of the best deals out there.
[01:44:22.860 --> 01:44:25.160]  Those silver dollars, you cannot beat that.
[01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:27.261]  Tell them it's the Alex Jones Radio Special.
[01:44:28.181 --> 01:44:30.443]  Take advantage of these low prices 800-686-2237
[01:44:44.358 --> 01:44:47.880]  Understand that global stocks are way down right now.
[01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:50.761]  That gold is shooting up all over the planet.
[01:44:50.761 --> 01:44:54.462]  All-time highs in Asia and Europe.
[01:44:54.462 --> 01:44:57.324]  800-686-2237.
[01:44:57.324 --> 01:44:58.844]  And it also does support the network.
[01:44:58.844 --> 01:45:01.946]  Minus Resources owns the GCN radio network.
[01:45:01.946 --> 01:45:04.087]  So it's a win-win, win-win-win.
[01:45:04.087 --> 01:45:06.368]  800-686-2237.
[01:45:06.368 --> 01:45:09.689]  Get into gold and silver today or go to MinusResources.com.
[01:45:09.689 --> 01:45:09.729]  800-686-2237.
[01:45:14.852 --> 01:45:19.999]  Alright, I apologize for having him hold while I was ranting, talking to Ted.
[01:45:19.999 --> 01:45:21.621]  He is Paul Dornanoo.
[01:45:21.621 --> 01:45:25.606]  He visited with us a few years ago in Istanbul, Turkey.
[01:45:25.606 --> 01:45:27.489]  He's from Romania.
[01:45:27.489 --> 01:45:32.135]  He shot great video and took great photos that we used in Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:45:33.539 --> 01:45:33.819]  of course.
[01:45:53.723 --> 01:45:54.423]  Hi Alex, good to be back.
[01:46:18.951 --> 01:46:19.812]  Good to have you here.
[01:46:19.812 --> 01:46:22.073]  We're going to have you for this segment and the next.
[01:46:22.073 --> 01:46:26.396]  The website's info, c-o-n dot r-o, infoconn dot r-o.
[01:46:26.396 --> 01:46:32.640]  Incredible photos and videos and research up on your journal, your online journal.
[01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:39.004]  But what else did you witness before you left on Sunday to go back to Romania?
[01:46:39.004 --> 01:46:42.867]  A. B. The Guardian reported, and we've got Skelton coming on later,
[01:46:44.093 --> 01:46:52.498]  Yes, Alex, I've heard about the arrest and detaining people.
[01:46:52.498 --> 01:47:07.085]  From what I know, there were some people, some guys, that tried to climb on the hills and in the forest to try taking closer pictures.
[01:47:07.085 --> 01:47:10.247]  And I actually have managed to see some of those pictures online.
[01:47:11.465 --> 01:47:15.948]  I haven't tried this year, you know, because last year we have had problems with police in Greece.
[01:47:15.948 --> 01:47:18.870]  We've been detained twice in Greece.
[01:47:18.870 --> 01:47:21.832]  We actually haven't tried to do anything stupid this year, but...
[01:47:23.030 --> 01:47:35.096]  Uh, we only stayed at the, uh, entrance of the hotel where basically we were able to make dozens of pictures with, uh, attendees, uh, coming out and, uh, coming in to the Dolce Hotel.
[01:47:35.096 --> 01:47:51.503]  And, uh, among these people, I can, uh, name, for example, the, uh, head of, uh, Daimler, uh, A.G., Daimler Chrysler, uh, company, Dieter Zetsch, or whatever it's spelled, and another, another one, the chief of Airbus, Tom Anderson.
[01:47:52.134 --> 01:47:56.136]  Those are two new names that we managed to take pictures of.
[01:47:56.136 --> 01:48:09.764]  And I think you saw the video in which a guy, probably not sure who he is, from a fiat company, waived the fee on us.
[01:48:09.764 --> 01:48:16.727]  I even said whose victory is that, ours or their victory.
[01:48:16.727 --> 01:48:17.928]  I think you saw that video.
[01:48:19.577 --> 01:48:48.830]  Well, what do you think of the Bloomberg reporting that, okay, there is a big cabal, there is a world government, I'm going to read over some of this in the next hour, and you can't blame the public for being into conspiracies because it looks like it's real, and that the Federal Reserve told Bloomberg that Bernanke wasn't there, though people reported seeing him there, and I've seen the media lie before in 2008 and say that Bernanke wasn't there, even though I saw him with my eyeballs at three feet away as he drove in, and we got video,
[01:48:49.150 --> 01:48:50.772]  And others got photos of him.
[01:48:50.772 --> 01:48:56.056]  They lied about Obama and Hillary being there in 08, but they were there, we know that.
[01:48:56.056 --> 01:48:59.880]  So, Bill Gates tried to lie about it, but got caught being there.
[01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:02.723]  I mean, more and more they're trying to hide the fact that they're attending this.
[01:49:03.706 --> 01:49:04.487]  Yes, for certain.
[01:49:04.487 --> 01:49:11.952]  There were people that they have been reported to be in there even right now, I guess.
[01:49:11.952 --> 01:49:16.416]  But they are not on the final list that we are seeing.
[01:49:16.416 --> 01:49:29.606]  And they have a website right now and I think they are forced, you know, to go public and try to minimize the event as, you know, being a private meeting, like a private company, which is not the fact.
[01:49:30.177 --> 01:49:41.652]  So, uh, what they're trying to do is right now, you know, to try to hide the presence of some people that, uh, even I photographed a couple of people that are not on that list.
[01:49:41.652 --> 01:49:45.197]  And that's why I was thinking, is this list genuine or not?
[01:49:45.197 --> 01:49:47.500]  Because the list is certainly not complete.
[01:49:48.729 --> 01:50:04.932]  Well that's another great point that you bring up, that some of the people aren't attending this year, but you're seeing people who are attending that aren't on the list, and now we're seeing it all over the European press, we're seeing it all over the U.S.
[01:50:04.932 --> 01:50:17.974]  press, and the word from the inside is, from Skelton and from Tucker, is they are dejected, they know that their carbon tax is in trouble, they know that their entire agenda is being revealed.
[01:50:19.039 --> 01:50:20.940]  Yes, they are scared.
[01:50:20.940 --> 01:50:23.261]  I can say for certain they are scared.
[01:50:23.261 --> 01:50:29.204]  And that's why I was actually wondering if it's our victory or their victory.
[01:50:29.204 --> 01:50:33.106]  That's why that guy showed us the big sign.
[01:50:33.106 --> 01:50:35.127]  For example, I was telling you earlier that
[01:50:36.899 --> 01:50:38.360]  Stay there, stay there.
[01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:43.843]  We're going to ask a few more questions in the next segment of Paul Dornanew.
[01:50:43.843 --> 01:50:46.024]  Joining us from Romania, Bilderberg 2010.
[01:50:46.024 --> 01:50:48.825]  This is very exciting news.
[01:50:48.825 --> 01:50:49.145]  Stay with us.
[01:51:01.448 --> 01:51:02.149]  You worry.
[01:51:02.149 --> 01:51:04.510]  If you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[01:51:04.510 --> 01:51:05.031]  Hi.
[01:51:05.031 --> 01:51:07.813]  Summer's coming and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[01:51:07.813 --> 01:51:12.377]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's a learning curve.
[01:51:12.377 --> 01:51:14.839]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[01:51:14.839 --> 01:51:18.201]  To speed it up, you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[01:51:18.201 --> 01:51:20.123]  Author Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[01:51:20.123 --> 01:51:22.925]  Her Wild Food Knowledge Package is the crash course.
[01:51:22.925 --> 01:51:26.648]  The DVD gives you a three-hour overview of her world directly from her.
[01:51:26.648 --> 01:51:30.691]  The book gives you an in-depth reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need.
[01:51:31.031 --> 01:51:35.132]  And her wild cards are your portable summary and cheat sheet for your fieldwork.
[01:51:35.132 --> 01:51:41.454]  This three-pronged learning system will take you from spectator to scholar to gourmet survivalist in weeks, not years.
[01:51:41.454 --> 01:51:43.815]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal.
[01:51:43.815 --> 01:51:45.936]  She's my mom and I watched her do it.
[01:51:45.936 --> 01:51:50.577]  So go to ofthefield.com or call 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[01:51:50.577 --> 01:51:51.498]  Start now.
[01:51:51.498 --> 01:51:53.218]  Knowledge is power.
[01:51:53.218 --> 01:51:54.219]  Better take action.
[01:51:54.219 --> 01:51:55.179]  I think a storm's coming.
[01:52:01.587 --> 01:52:02.888]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:02.888 --> 01:52:08.471]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:08.471 --> 01:52:13.493]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:13.493 --> 01:52:19.056]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:52:19.056 --> 01:52:24.299]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:24.299 --> 01:52:26.160]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:52:26.590 --> 01:52:31.393]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:52:31.393 --> 01:52:32.514]  And here's the best part.
[01:52:32.514 --> 01:52:35.296]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:52:35.296 --> 01:52:39.218]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:52:39.218 --> 01:52:42.400]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:42.400 --> 01:52:44.622]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:44.622 --> 01:52:45.563]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:52:45.563 --> 01:52:45.743]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:52:54.332 --> 01:52:58.256]  In a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:58.256 --> 01:53:00.619]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:53:01.630 --> 01:53:04.631]  You've seen our Sinofresh banner on the GCN website.
[01:53:04.631 --> 01:53:06.691]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[01:53:06.691 --> 01:53:09.452]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[01:53:09.452 --> 01:53:11.673]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[01:53:11.673 --> 01:53:13.073]  Okay, here it comes.
[01:53:13.073 --> 01:53:14.974]  But first, the facts.
[01:53:14.974 --> 01:53:16.914]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[01:53:16.914 --> 01:53:18.895]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[01:53:18.895 --> 01:53:22.576]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[01:53:22.576 --> 01:53:30.338]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.
[01:53:30.338 --> 01:53:30.938]  Sinofresh.

[01:53:50.589 --> 01:53:50.949]  Mention GCN.

[01:53:51.889 --> 01:53:52.069]  It works!
[01:54:07.443 --> 01:54:11.315]  Coming up at about 8 after in the second segment in the next hour for one segment.
[01:54:13.302 --> 01:54:15.904]  We're going to be joined by Mark Anderson of American Free Press.
[01:54:15.904 --> 01:54:19.767]  The intel he got Friday, Saturday, and Sunday at Bilderberg.
[01:54:19.767 --> 01:54:21.808]  Squeeze some more key info out of that reporter.
[01:54:21.808 --> 01:54:23.550]  Appreciate him joining us.
[01:54:23.550 --> 01:54:27.272]  And then Charlie Skelton, who's been a wealth of info, the London Guardian.
[01:54:27.272 --> 01:54:32.336]  The aftermath, he did get detained again this year after we talked to him Friday.
[01:54:32.336 --> 01:54:33.777]  So breaking news on that front.
[01:54:33.777 --> 01:54:37.400]  Because folks, Bilderberg Group is as high level as it gets.
[01:54:37.400 --> 01:54:39.041]  It's a component of Club of 300.
[01:54:40.532 --> 01:54:42.113]  It's a component of Club of Rome.
[01:54:42.113 --> 01:54:45.415]  You know, the Committee of 300.
[01:54:45.415 --> 01:54:47.677]  It's a component of the Trilateral Commission.
[01:54:47.677 --> 01:54:49.598]  Very highest level.
[01:54:49.598 --> 01:54:51.860]  And they are in trouble.
[01:54:51.860 --> 01:54:52.840]  They are upset.
[01:54:52.840 --> 01:54:55.242]  They know the whole world's waking up to them.
[01:54:55.242 --> 01:54:56.683]  Look at the news headlines.
[01:54:56.683 --> 01:54:58.464]  Look at the resistance.
[01:54:58.464 --> 01:55:03.648]  Look at how Obama, their savior that they wanted to sell world government with, is falling apart.
[01:55:04.690 --> 01:55:06.952]  The people are really waking up.
[01:55:06.952 --> 01:55:08.874]  This is so exciting.
[01:55:08.874 --> 01:55:10.355]  But we're far from winning here.
[01:55:10.355 --> 01:55:17.962]  We've got to accelerate the awakening with films like Invisible Empire, Endgame, Terror Storm, Obama Deception, Fall of the Republic.
[01:55:17.962 --> 01:55:21.886]  Now is the time to be reaching out and getting the word out, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:55:22.608 --> 01:55:25.250]  So get the films at Infowars.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:55:52.588 --> 01:55:53.629]  Go ahead.
[01:55:53.629 --> 01:56:11.921]  Yes, Alex, I just wanted to bring this up because Sunday there was no media coverage at all compared to the previous days where you had, you know, three, four, five even TV stations doing live broadcasts right from there.
[01:56:11.921 --> 01:56:14.002]  Sunday there was no press.
[01:56:14.002 --> 01:56:19.186]  There were just only a few people there doing pictures and taking videos.
[01:56:20.328 --> 01:56:31.188]  And I'm not sure what, uh, what happened, but, uh, I suspect, uh, billboards have, uh, started to put pressure on the local media from Spain not to broadcast anything.
[01:56:31.957 --> 01:56:38.039]  Well, they have something called geo-filtering with videos and articles, and I know Google's doing it.
[01:56:38.039 --> 01:56:45.562]  They will not allow any articles that we write to go through the Google News system, though all our others are accepted immediately.
[01:56:45.562 --> 01:56:51.945]  And our video won't list under Google News when we talk about Bill Gates.
[01:56:51.945 --> 01:56:54.846]  So the name Bill Gates has a hold on it.
[01:56:55.646 --> 01:57:03.118]  And it came out today that BP is paying Google and Yahoo to block out negative searches on them.
[01:57:03.118 --> 01:57:06.423]  So we're really getting a 21st century example of censorship.
[01:57:06.423 --> 01:57:09.087]  They did not want it out that Bill Gates was in attendance.
[01:57:11.445 --> 01:57:12.707]  Exactly.
[01:57:12.707 --> 01:57:13.508]  That's my point.
[01:57:13.508 --> 01:57:22.098]  They're trying to cover this as much as possible, even if the big damage has been done already.
[01:57:22.098 --> 01:57:24.741]  I think that's our victory.
[01:57:24.741 --> 01:57:28.486]  In the end, we managed to expose them as much as possible.
[01:57:29.430 --> 01:57:36.055]  Whereas other people in the past didn't care about Biloberg, they now started to find out and question it.
[01:57:36.055 --> 01:57:42.880]  Even Biloberg was exposed in the European Parliament, which is a great thing to happen to date.
[01:57:44.460 --> 01:57:45.740]  Oh, it's incredible!
[01:57:45.740 --> 01:57:54.383]  I mean, it is not a complete implosion, but a serious blow, and if we press the issue, it could be a death blow.
[01:57:54.383 --> 01:58:09.508]  Now, the apparatus of world government's already in place, so it'll continue to move forward, but we are certainly slowing it down, and, you know, as one Bilderberg group member said, we're about whipped, according to Tucker, that's from an inside source, on the global warming tax.
[01:58:09.508 --> 01:58:12.529]  I mean, they are in so much trouble right now,
[01:58:13.169 --> 01:58:22.617]  And I just can't express to people how exciting this is because we're now addressing the actual controllers, not their front puppets that normally take all the heat for them.
[01:58:22.617 --> 01:58:25.620]  Well, Paul Dornanew, I want to thank you for joining us today.
[01:58:25.620 --> 01:58:27.801]  We look forward to talking to you again in the future.
[01:58:27.801 --> 01:58:31.544]  Infocon.ro is your excellent website.
[01:58:31.544 --> 01:58:32.485]  God bless you, my friend.
[01:58:32.485 --> 01:58:34.387]  Thank you, sir, Alex.
[01:58:34.387 --> 01:58:34.787]  You bet.
[01:58:34.787 --> 01:58:37.950]  Great job there, independent journalist out there.
[01:58:37.950 --> 01:58:40.172]  It's those type of fellows that are going to save the human race.
[01:58:42.748 --> 01:58:45.992]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:54.983 --> 01:58:56.244]  Tyranny is here.
[01:58:56.244 --> 01:59:00.169]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:59:00.169 --> 01:59:02.571]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:59:02.571 --> 01:59:08.277]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:59:08.277 --> 01:59:14.524]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:59:14.944 --> 01:59:20.889]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:59:20.889 --> 01:59:25.092]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:59:25.092 --> 01:59:29.376]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:59:29.376 --> 01:59:35.341]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:59:35.341 --> 01:59:38.904]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:59:38.904 --> 01:59:40.865]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:59:40.865 --> 01:59:41.306]  It's here.

[02:00:05.975 --> 02:00:07.276]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.276 --> 02:00:08.256]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:09.037 --> 02:00:10.798]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.798 --> 02:00:12.379]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.379 --> 02:00:13.940]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.940 --> 02:00:18.122]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.122 --> 02:00:22.325]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.325 --> 02:00:27.468]  Alright, we're gonna continue with some phone calls in this hour.
[02:00:27.468 --> 02:00:30.409]  Bunch of other news I need to at least briefly hit on.
[02:00:30.409 --> 02:00:31.930]  Big news splits in the last hour.
[02:00:31.930 --> 02:00:34.912]  Paul Watson's gonna be sitting in today and tomorrow in the last hour.
[02:00:36.809 --> 02:00:41.191]  Right now, let's go back to your phone calls.
[02:00:41.191 --> 02:00:44.072]  Who's up next here, John?
[02:00:44.072 --> 02:00:47.153]  Eric in New York, then Mr. Nobody.
[02:00:47.153 --> 02:00:49.714]  Everybody's a somebody, Mr. Nobody.
[02:00:49.714 --> 02:00:51.415]  Eric in New York, you're on the air.
[02:00:51.415 --> 02:00:54.236]  Hey Alex, this is Eric.
[02:00:54.236 --> 02:00:55.896]  Thank you.
[02:00:55.896 --> 02:00:58.737]  I'm a big fan of yours.
[02:00:58.737 --> 02:01:02.479]  I know exactly what you're talking about with this scum.
[02:01:03.928 --> 02:01:09.269]  Cops and army guys running around the country.
[02:01:09.269 --> 02:01:12.329]  Well, I'm not saying police and military are all scum.
[02:01:12.329 --> 02:01:19.851]  I'm saying the people running it and trying to overturn the republic are scum.
[02:01:19.851 --> 02:01:23.351]  Oh yeah, I mean, I used to be a vet.
[02:01:23.351 --> 02:01:25.652]  Well, I am a vet, of course.
[02:01:25.652 --> 02:01:33.213]  But I went down to New York City to visit my grandmother and I'm at the Port Authority with my army shirt.
[02:01:34.128 --> 02:01:55.034]  And I was reading your pocket constitution that I received from you guys, and I noticed there was like a battalion of troops just running around the Port Authority in full battle gear, just... Oh yeah, I've seen them in New York with loaded 45s and M16s, all to acclimate the public.
[02:01:55.034 --> 02:02:02.616]  Oh yeah, and then I see them and they took my pocket constitution and they just threw it in the trash.
[02:02:03.075 --> 02:02:04.276]  And told me to keep moving.
[02:02:04.276 --> 02:02:07.119]  I said, hey listen, you know, you can't just do that.
[02:02:07.119 --> 02:02:16.527]  I mean, I have video police at a checkpoint find a pop constitution and begin to breathe heavy and get scared like they found a hundred foot cobra with red eyes.
[02:02:16.527 --> 02:02:18.549]  And, uh, they do get scared.
[02:02:18.549 --> 02:02:21.812]  I mean, it's like a vampire seeing a silver cross.
[02:02:21.812 --> 02:02:22.033]  It's like,
[02:02:24.875 --> 02:02:28.137]  I mean it's, I'm surprised they don't burst into flame.
[02:02:28.137 --> 02:02:32.699]  You like hold a pocket constitution up and they're like, but I mean are you serious?
[02:02:32.699 --> 02:02:36.121]  They actually grabbed your pocket constitution away?
[02:02:36.121 --> 02:02:37.662]  Oh yeah, they just took it.
[02:02:37.662 --> 02:02:49.888]  I was in New York and there were troops with 45s across the street and they saw me with a camera and they start cussing and they run across the street going, I'm gonna, I mean this is on video in Endgame.
[02:02:50.902 --> 02:02:58.686]  And they come running across the street and get in my face and I went ahead and bowed up to them and I said, you're a traitor, get out of my face and they backed off.
[02:02:58.686 --> 02:03:02.008]  I found if you grovel, then they start thinking it's normal.
[02:03:02.008 --> 02:03:03.489]  Yeah, that's a terrorist.
[02:03:03.489 --> 02:03:05.050]  He's got a constitution.
[02:03:05.050 --> 02:03:06.751]  So I mean, why did they grab your constitution?
[02:03:06.751 --> 02:03:08.932]  I mean, they thought that was threatening?
[02:03:08.932 --> 02:03:17.877]  They, I don't know what they were thinking, but they thought, you know, I don't know what they thought, you know, you know, what are you doing with that?
[02:03:17.877 --> 02:03:19.278]  And I said, you know,
[02:03:20.433 --> 02:03:23.995]  Well, they've been trained by the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center well.
[02:03:23.995 --> 02:03:26.457]  Hey, pretty soon they see an American flag, they'll flip out.
[02:03:26.457 --> 02:03:27.938]  I mean, look at San Francisco.
[02:03:27.938 --> 02:03:32.100]  You can't even have an American flag flying.
[02:03:32.100 --> 02:03:43.267]  I mean, that's just a... I mean, you know, they see a pocket Constitution... I mean, if an American flag scares these people, what do you think a Constitution does?
[02:03:43.267 --> 02:03:49.911]  They told me it was like... They told me I read too much, and that's one of those extremist books.
[02:03:50.794 --> 02:03:52.776]  I'm like, what?
[02:03:52.776 --> 02:03:55.538]  I thought I was... So this really happened?
[02:03:55.538 --> 02:03:56.199]  Well, I believe you.
[02:03:56.199 --> 02:03:57.159]  I've seen similar things.
[02:03:57.159 --> 02:03:59.461]  I appreciate the call.
[02:03:59.461 --> 02:04:00.402]  And maybe they're right.
[02:04:00.402 --> 02:04:04.546]  Maybe he is evil in America with a pocket Constitution.
[02:04:04.546 --> 02:04:07.028]  The Constitution?
[02:04:07.028 --> 02:04:17.557]  Folks, I can play you video of FEMA training demonizing the Constitution, and I can play you video in Road to Tyranny from the squad car of the police at a warrantless checkpoint.
[02:04:18.504 --> 02:04:33.072]  Searching cars and they find a, anything with the word Patriot, they find a videotape, this was ten years ago, nine years ago, they find a VHS tape of Patriot games with Harrison Ford and they get scared.
[02:04:33.072 --> 02:04:34.272]  It's got an American flag on it.
[02:04:34.272 --> 02:04:34.913]  I'm not kidding!
[02:04:36.007 --> 02:04:40.810]  And then they find the pocket constitution and they're going, oh my god, I can't believe it.
[02:04:40.810 --> 02:04:41.871]  She's one of them.
[02:04:41.871 --> 02:04:44.193]  They're going, what are we going to do with this?
[02:04:44.193 --> 02:04:44.873]  I don't know.
[02:04:44.873 --> 02:04:45.934]  Is she allowed to have it?
[02:04:45.934 --> 02:04:46.995]  I don't think so.
[02:04:46.995 --> 02:04:48.876]  Good Lord, we got one of them.
[02:04:48.876 --> 02:04:50.337]  We got paraphernalia.
[02:04:50.337 --> 02:04:51.438]  These are quotes.
[02:04:51.438 --> 02:04:52.098]  I ought to play that.
[02:04:52.098 --> 02:04:57.342]  They're just like, I got one of the people that loves America.
[02:04:57.342 --> 02:04:58.923]  What are we going to do?
[02:04:58.923 --> 02:05:00.745]  Our boss told us about these.
[02:05:01.533 --> 02:05:04.537]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:05:04.537 --> 02:05:09.884]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:05:09.884 --> 02:05:11.927]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:05:11.927 --> 02:05:16.933]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:05:16.933 --> 02:05:18.115]  How much do you want?
[02:05:18.115 --> 02:05:18.856]  When do you want it?
[02:05:19.216 --> 02:05:21.096]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:05:21.096 --> 02:05:22.177]  When will you need it?
[02:05:22.177 --> 02:05:24.377]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:05:24.377 --> 02:05:25.718]  Will there be any food?
[02:05:25.718 --> 02:05:27.238]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:05:27.238 --> 02:05:32.519]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:05:32.519 --> 02:05:36.100]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:05:36.100 --> 02:05:39.561]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:05:39.921 --> 02:05:41.141]  How much will you need?
[02:05:41.141 --> 02:05:42.042]  We don't know.
[02:05:42.042 --> 02:05:43.142]  How much do you want?
[02:05:43.142 --> 02:05:44.082]  All you can get.
[02:05:44.082 --> 02:05:45.162]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:05:45.162 --> 02:05:48.223]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[02:06:57.027 --> 02:06:57.808]  Check them out today.
[02:07:00.191 --> 02:07:02.493]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:07:02.493 --> 02:07:04.894]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:07:04.894 --> 02:07:08.096]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:07:08.096 --> 02:07:13.220]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:07:13.220 --> 02:07:17.743]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:07:17.743 --> 02:07:20.084]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:07:20.084 --> 02:07:22.966]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:07:22.966 --> 02:07:25.468]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:07:25.868 --> 02:07:33.472]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:07:33.809 --> 02:07:39.194]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:07:39.194 --> 02:07:42.037]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:07:42.037 --> 02:07:45.741]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:07:45.741 --> 02:07:46.802]  And I got news for you.
[02:07:46.802 --> 02:07:48.143]  You're everyone else.
[02:07:48.143 --> 02:07:49.644]  Invisible Empire.

[02:08:02.893 --> 02:08:09.515]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:09.515 --> 02:08:25.539]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:25.539 --> 02:08:27.680]  All right, my friends, he is still in
[02:08:29.327 --> 02:08:30.128]  We're good to go.
[02:08:59.707 --> 02:09:04.151]  And that they said that, well, that's why our welfare state is too big.
[02:09:04.151 --> 02:09:08.434]  We need to make the public so poor they can't afford to even come to these events.
[02:09:08.434 --> 02:09:10.996]  See, that's why they want to bankrupt society.
[02:09:10.996 --> 02:09:18.181]  So you're so poor, you're literally starving to death so the Bilderberg Group can fly around above you in their jet aircraft like they're God.
[02:09:20.430 --> 02:09:22.911]  It's in Bloomberg, it's all over U.S.
[02:09:22.911 --> 02:09:25.572]  news, it's all over foreign news.
[02:09:25.572 --> 02:09:29.053]  I have to say this is the biggest rout in Bilderberg history.
[02:09:29.053 --> 02:09:31.913]  Jim Tucker agreed when he was on Friday.
[02:09:31.913 --> 02:09:33.274]  He's already flying back to the U.S.
[02:09:33.274 --> 02:09:35.514]  He's going to be on for a full report later in the week.
[02:09:35.514 --> 02:09:39.275]  Our final report on Bilderberg until next year.
[02:09:39.275 --> 02:09:41.436]  We also have the fact that
[02:09:42.857 --> 02:09:45.459]  Bill Gates was there, other people were there.
[02:09:45.459 --> 02:09:54.267]  The news is reporting, Bloomberg is reporting that Bernanke didn't show up, but our intel is that he was there.
[02:09:54.267 --> 02:10:00.252]  I know Bernanke was there in 2006 and 2008, of course, Chairman of the Federal Reserve.
[02:10:00.252 --> 02:10:05.697]  But the bad news is, the majority of them for the first time are greenlighting an attack on Iran.
[02:10:06.517 --> 02:10:10.179]  That doesn't mean it's 100%, but it's all going in that direction.
[02:10:10.179 --> 02:10:16.583]  And, of course, Tucker in 2002 said the attack won't be in 2002, when the media was saying it would be, including the Washington Post.
[02:10:16.583 --> 02:10:18.945]  He said Donald Graham, the publisher, was there.
[02:10:18.945 --> 02:10:20.686]  It's going to be March of 2003.
[02:10:20.686 --> 02:10:22.687]  He said that over a year before.
[02:10:22.687 --> 02:10:24.308]  He was correct.
[02:10:24.308 --> 02:10:27.930]  And so the fact that Iran is green-lighted is very, very scary.
[02:10:27.930 --> 02:10:33.974]  To give us the latest developments and go over those points I just made is Mark Anderson of AmericanFreePress.net.
[02:10:33.974 --> 02:10:35.095]  Mark, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:10:35.815 --> 02:10:36.856]  You're welcome, Alex.
[02:10:36.856 --> 02:10:41.738]  It's been a very interesting last 24 hours in particular.
[02:10:41.738 --> 02:10:48.882]  The route that you're talking about, I believe you mean how they were kind of smoked out of here in a way.
[02:10:48.882 --> 02:11:02.550]  The understanding from talking to the hotel repeatedly, badgering them for press conferences, badgering them for information, not letting up one bit, was that you couldn't get in there publicly in the Dolce Hotel until today at noon.
[02:11:03.110 --> 02:11:06.791]  Well, they were gone out of here yesterday evening.
[02:11:06.791 --> 02:11:10.552]  And the meeting was really supposed to last until this morning.
[02:11:10.552 --> 02:11:15.374]  Traditionally, according to my colleague Jim Tucker, they always have their Monday breakfast before they depart.
[02:11:15.374 --> 02:11:20.236]  I think the last man standing, the last Bilderberg out of here was probably maybe 9 p.m.
[02:11:20.236 --> 02:11:21.416]  last night.
[02:11:21.416 --> 02:11:22.916]  And I talked to a lot of different people.
[02:11:22.916 --> 02:11:24.097]  Was that Etienne D'Avignon?
[02:11:25.247 --> 02:11:26.067]  I'm sorry?
[02:11:26.067 --> 02:11:27.828]  Who was the last to leave?
[02:11:27.828 --> 02:11:29.269]  Oh, I don't know specifically.
[02:11:29.269 --> 02:11:36.291]  I just know that it seems that all the publicity just kind of made them turn tail and run a little bit.
[02:11:36.291 --> 02:11:38.752]  Maybe not in a fleeing fashion.
[02:11:38.752 --> 02:11:42.654]  I'm not going to say they fled, but I think it just got a little too inhospitable
[02:11:42.734 --> 02:11:45.235]  Well, by route, their entire agenda's in trouble.
[02:11:45.235 --> 02:11:47.355]  They're now all over the newspapers worldwide.
[02:11:47.355 --> 02:11:49.156]  The Drudge Report every day.
[02:11:49.156 --> 02:11:51.837]  Bloomberg's going, okay, there is a global government.
[02:11:51.837 --> 02:11:53.597]  Okay, this is suspicious.
[02:11:53.597 --> 02:11:55.598]  You know, where were you, Bernanke?
[02:11:55.598 --> 02:11:56.758]  Obama's their puppet.
[02:11:56.758 --> 02:11:58.399]  That's in the news.
[02:11:58.399 --> 02:12:06.661]  Tucker said that they... Bilderberg sources told him that one Bilderberg group member said, we're about whipped on climate change taxes.
[02:12:06.661 --> 02:12:09.082]  But, their race on the whole is starting World War III.
[02:12:10.376 --> 02:12:14.897]  Well, what you said about Iran certainly rings pretty true.
[02:12:14.897 --> 02:12:17.718]  Just how close they are to that is very difficult to say.
[02:12:17.718 --> 02:12:38.884]  Bill Gates' appearance here brought about some confirmation that he was here under one guise, but his actual reason for being here was to try and sell Deputero, the Spanish prime minister who gave the opening address, like most nationals do that host the meetings, try and sell him on the green tax, I think otherwise known as the carbon tax.
[02:12:44.430 --> 02:12:55.903]  Exactly, and we know Greece was the first to adopt the green jobs that take two jobs for every new job, and even the Spanish leaders have said that was the coup de grace that killed their economy.
[02:12:56.832 --> 02:13:06.241]  Yeah, so it seems Bill Gates used a disingenuous excuse to get here just to generally counsel the PM on the economy, but it was specifically about that tax.
[02:13:06.241 --> 02:13:14.409]  Barcelona, June 5th, Saturday, 1,000 anti-Israeli marchers on the flotilla thing, but 200 anti-Bilderberg marchers joined them.
[02:13:14.409 --> 02:13:18.093]  1,200 people in the center of Barcelona.
[02:13:20.442 --> 02:13:22.786]  Absolutely amazing.
[02:13:22.786 --> 02:13:24.027]  What about Jim Zintel?
[02:13:24.027 --> 02:13:27.232]  I know you went with him.
[02:13:27.232 --> 02:13:34.121]  Anything else that he said about the fact that one of the Bilderberg members said we're about whipped on the carbon tax?
[02:13:35.171 --> 02:13:37.955]  Well, I don't know about that one.
[02:13:37.955 --> 02:13:43.883]  I would be less than honest if I could answer that one, if I tried to answer that definitively.
[02:13:43.883 --> 02:13:48.749]  All I know is Gates was here to discuss it, but where they went on that, I don't know.
[02:13:48.749 --> 02:13:52.093]  I think part of the situation where it seems they really had to
[02:13:52.834 --> 02:13:53.434]  We're good to go.
[02:14:18.539 --> 02:14:21.443]  Supposedly the Spanish taxpayers don't have to pick all that up.
[02:14:21.443 --> 02:14:22.143]  It's reimbursed.
[02:14:22.143 --> 02:14:24.486]  So that's just the miscellaneous matters.
[02:14:24.486 --> 02:14:27.570]  But everything's just kind of coming together plank by plank here.
[02:14:28.507 --> 02:14:40.591]  But the real story here, and in the brief time we have, is that the media attention was so great that I think they really had to kind of abbreviate everything and get on out of here.
[02:14:40.591 --> 02:14:41.732]  They know they're not welcome.
[02:14:41.732 --> 02:14:45.133]  It's an inhospitable place, perhaps anywhere they'll go now.
[02:14:45.133 --> 02:14:55.016]  I think that the bottom line is that the news doesn't remain a flash in the pan or doesn't be too sporadic, but becomes long-term, sustained coverage of what they're doing.
[02:14:55.016 --> 02:14:57.197]  And that's a critical point for independent media.
[02:14:57.997 --> 02:15:01.521]  Well yeah, Paul Dornanew of Romania brought this up.
[02:15:01.521 --> 02:15:08.908]  He said that he's talked to Dutch and others that say they've been to the steering committees that only have 20-30 members of Bilderberg.
[02:15:08.908 --> 02:15:11.711]  We know Bilderberg does have those steering committee hearings.
[02:15:11.711 --> 02:15:14.213]  Sometimes they have them at trilateral commission meetings.
[02:15:14.213 --> 02:15:20.940]  The good news is we now see people going to the trilateral meetings, the CFR meetings, all of the sub-meetings.
[02:15:22.515 --> 02:15:42.422]  Yes, yes, that's right, and the former Spanish PM spoke to the Chicago Council on Global Affairs that I covered, and he said some things that kind of laid some hints for here, and that was back in April, and he's Aznar, Jose Aznar, I don't remember his full name.
[02:15:43.182 --> 02:15:43.663]  I think?
[02:16:12.722 --> 02:16:13.822]  Let's start talking.
[02:16:13.822 --> 02:16:20.265]  Well, I noticed that Saturday and Sunday I saw reports of more nations support sanctions or blockade on Iran.
[02:16:20.265 --> 02:16:25.107]  So we saw the drumbeat for war with Iran intensify after Bilderberg.
[02:16:25.107 --> 02:16:28.748]  Here's one out of the Canadian news, Globe and Mail.
[02:16:28.748 --> 02:16:31.930]  Canada wins key fight against bank tax.
[02:16:31.930 --> 02:16:37.452]  Canada has won a key fight in its high-profile international campaign against the global bank tax.
[02:16:37.452 --> 02:16:39.493]  So countries have to win fights
[02:16:40.433 --> 02:16:40.573]  I think?
[02:16:58.451 --> 02:17:01.213]  Us to have our own affairs, Mr. Anderson?
[02:17:01.213 --> 02:17:06.738]  Yeah, that's the thing among the Spanish citizenry here and among the shopkeepers.
[02:17:06.738 --> 02:17:14.504]  That's what they, above and beyond the secrecy of Bilderberg and what are they doing in our country and what's going on, they kind of sense this condescension.
[02:17:14.504 --> 02:17:19.648]  There they are at the Hotel Dolce up on the ivory tower hill looking down upon the city.
[02:17:19.648 --> 02:17:23.551]  You know, the metaphor is unmistakable and they sense that there's this
[02:17:24.071 --> 02:17:32.016]  This, you know, all kind of papering over of their sovereignty and then to sort of override their local control.
[02:17:32.016 --> 02:17:37.719]  Even the local governor, I'm told by a pretty good source, Spain has like eight provinces.
[02:17:37.719 --> 02:17:39.760]  One of them is Catalonia, where I'm at.
[02:17:39.760 --> 02:17:45.403]  And that governor or president of this province also was reportedly at Bilderberg.
[02:17:45.403 --> 02:17:53.008]  And so this is a local that should be fighting this breach of sovereignty who instead is going to the meeting.
[02:17:54.178 --> 02:17:54.798]  Disgusting.
[02:17:54.798 --> 02:17:59.540]  We've only got about two minutes left with Mark Anderson of AmericanFreePress.net.
[02:17:59.540 --> 02:18:02.881]  Any other key intel that's come out of the meeting?
[02:18:02.881 --> 02:18:06.782]  Well, a lot of things are still falling into place.
[02:18:06.782 --> 02:18:10.183]  As I say, they kind of turntailed and run.
[02:18:10.183 --> 02:18:12.184]  Iran rather, excuse me.
[02:18:12.184 --> 02:18:16.265]  I think that we're pretty square on the Iran thing being a high priority.
[02:18:16.265 --> 02:18:21.427]  They keep trying to say that a country with not a single operational nuclear weapon is a nuclear threat.
[02:18:21.947 --> 02:18:33.452]  When other nations, Israel on up, have plenty, then you have the economic thing, the carbon green tax that could hurt any country and its consumers.
[02:18:33.452 --> 02:18:42.355]  And, you know, right on down the list with their IMF as the world treasury, you know, there was the big marches, all the awareness going on.
[02:18:42.355 --> 02:18:46.217]  I mentioned the Barcelona... What about arrest and people being detained?
[02:18:46.217 --> 02:18:48.758]  That came out in The Guardian that that did happen on Friday and Saturday.
[02:18:49.525 --> 02:18:58.573]  Well, from what I saw, and I gotta say it was a little bit limited because I was partially in the field, partially at headquarters if you will.
[02:18:58.573 --> 02:19:00.875]  I didn't see a lot of that and I didn't hear a lot of it.
[02:19:00.875 --> 02:19:04.518]  I think it was relatively brief and relatively limited.
[02:19:04.518 --> 02:19:07.661]  So a lot more limited than Greece where they went hog wild last year?
[02:19:07.981 --> 02:19:10.142]  Yeah, these police were pretty restrained.
[02:19:10.142 --> 02:19:11.802]  Oh, there is another thing.
[02:19:11.802 --> 02:19:16.323]  The Police Union Catalonia is registering a fairly major complaint.
[02:19:16.323 --> 02:19:17.864]  They issued a press release.
[02:19:17.864 --> 02:19:23.125]  They disagree with police being used in this manner to cover an elite group like this.
[02:19:23.125 --> 02:19:26.846]  This is in the actual press release of the Catalonian Police Union.
[02:19:26.886 --> 02:19:32.149]  Hold on, this is huge news, and I know you gotta get packed and fly out of there, but I may have to hold you a few minutes.
[02:19:32.149 --> 02:19:41.293]  This is, the police are finally saying, plus the whole country's going bankrupt, that we don't want to be protecting these globalists?
[02:19:41.293 --> 02:19:46.996]  Well, they might not have used the word globalists, but they said, the way they call it around here is Club Bilderberg.
[02:19:46.996 --> 02:19:49.338]  That's the common reference in Europe.
[02:19:49.338 --> 02:19:55.761]  And they, it's just sort of like, we don't believe this sort of thing is the police's job with so many officers working.
[02:19:55.981 --> 02:20:00.175]  I'll tell you what, Mark, stay there for just one minute after when I'll also plug the magazine.
[02:20:00.175 --> 02:20:01.018]  I want to see this.
[02:20:02.227 --> 02:20:03.487]  Global meltdowns.
[02:20:03.487 --> 02:20:04.888]  Massive unemployment.
[02:20:04.888 --> 02:20:06.108]  Endless wars.
[02:20:06.108 --> 02:20:07.749]  A new currency crisis.
[02:20:07.749 --> 02:20:09.830]  Financially and morally bankrupt.
[02:20:09.830 --> 02:20:11.970]  A great and terrible storm is approaching.
[02:20:11.970 --> 02:20:13.871]  So what's the best way to get ready?
[02:20:13.871 --> 02:20:15.952]  To get prepared for hard times ahead.
[02:20:15.952 --> 02:20:17.952]  Introducing Off The Grid News.
[02:20:17.952 --> 02:20:24.455]  A weekly newsletter for independent patriots who want practical advice on how to survive and prosper in an increasingly dangerous world.
[02:20:24.455 --> 02:20:29.716]  It's the best way to get a black belt in emergency preparedness, survival skills, and off-the-grid living.
[02:20:29.716 --> 02:20:31.637]  Off The Grid News is fiercely independent
[02:20:31.917 --> 02:20:41.981]  All about self-reliance and packed with helpful information on survival gardening, food preparation, alternative energy, herbal medicines, privacy and security, as well as God, gold, and guns.
[02:20:41.981 --> 02:20:44.122]  With absolutely no apologies.
[02:20:44.122 --> 02:20:44.942]  And the best part?
[02:20:44.942 --> 02:20:49.024]  This $100 a year service is now free of charge for our listeners.
[02:20:49.024 --> 02:20:53.265]  That's right, free for our listeners who sign up at OffTheGridNews.com.
[02:20:53.265 --> 02:20:55.166]  That's OffTheGridNews.com.
[02:20:55.166 --> 02:20:58.367]  You can sign up for free at OffTheGridNews.com.

[02:21:01.542 --> 02:21:11.564]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[02:21:11.564 --> 02:21:18.006]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[02:21:18.006 --> 02:21:26.848]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[02:21:27.248 --> 02:21:36.432]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[02:21:36.432 --> 02:21:41.033]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[02:21:41.033 --> 02:21:42.814]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:21:42.814 --> 02:21:45.335]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[02:21:45.615 --> 02:21:48.937]  Call me today at 800-686-2237.
[02:21:48.937 --> 02:21:53.119]  I will give you a silver dollar free just for purchasing the book.
[02:21:53.119 --> 02:21:53.880]  Call today at 800-686-2237.
[02:21:53.880 --> 02:21:54.200]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[02:22:01.517 --> 02:22:03.900]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:22:03.900 --> 02:22:06.223]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:22:06.223 --> 02:22:09.427]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:22:09.427 --> 02:22:14.534]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:22:14.534 --> 02:22:18.739]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:22:19.039 --> 02:22:21.383]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:22:21.383 --> 02:22:24.267]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:22:24.267 --> 02:22:27.191]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:22:27.191 --> 02:22:34.803]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:22:35.123 --> 02:22:40.526]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:22:40.526 --> 02:22:43.367]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:22:43.367 --> 02:22:47.049]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:22:47.049 --> 02:22:48.129]  And I got news for you.
[02:22:48.129 --> 02:22:49.470]  You're everyone else.
[02:22:49.470 --> 02:22:50.971]  Invisible Empire.

[02:23:00.817 --> 02:23:02.597]  Normal blood pressure, naturally.
[02:23:02.597 --> 02:23:03.938]  How would that make you feel?
[02:23:03.938 --> 02:23:05.638]  I'm Don from New Mexico.
[02:23:05.638 --> 02:23:08.199]  January of 2000, I had a heart attack.
[02:23:08.199 --> 02:23:15.741]  Then my real health began going downhill, and I had high blood pressure, high blood sugar, poor vision, and I really wasn't sleeping well.
[02:23:15.741 --> 02:23:17.241]  I was a mess, pretty much.
[02:23:17.241 --> 02:23:20.002]  Don reports dramatic improvements with heart and body extract.
[02:23:20.002 --> 02:23:25.303]  I started taking heart and body extract, and from within a few days, I started sleeping a lot better.
[02:23:25.303 --> 02:23:30.364]  My blood pressure normalized, my blood sugar normalized, and my sleep really did improve.
[02:23:30.544 --> 02:23:35.648]  Experience these benefits and more when your body gets what it needs with the assistance of Heart and Body Extract.
[02:23:35.648 --> 02:23:40.071]  Order at HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305.
[02:23:40.071 --> 02:23:44.755]  That's HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305.
[02:23:44.755 --> 02:23:48.137]  Folks, I did not expect this at all.
[02:23:48.137 --> 02:23:52.861]  By the 7th, 8th, and 9th day, I saw dramatic improvements from taking Heart and Body Extract.
[02:23:52.861 --> 02:23:56.323]  Details at HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305 for Heart and Body Extract.
[02:24:13.106 --> 02:24:16.167]  I wish a buck was still silver.
[02:24:16.167 --> 02:24:21.029]  It was back when the country was... Well, Mark Anderson's there.
[02:24:21.029 --> 02:24:28.652]  He says it's in the local Sitges News in Catalonia that the police have filed a complaint.
[02:24:28.652 --> 02:24:31.493]  Flesh that out some more because that's big news.
[02:24:31.493 --> 02:24:33.434]  We need to get an article out and get that up on the Drugs Report.
[02:24:34.654 --> 02:24:36.836]  I don't know the full nature of it.
[02:24:36.836 --> 02:24:58.371]  It's in Spanish, but the basic thing is the police union of the Catalonian region, one of seven or eight regions that comprise Spain, just said pretty straightforward, maybe nothing, you know, earth-shattering, that they just don't think that this is a judicious use of police resources to guard this, you know, upper-scale group meeting at a hotel.
[02:24:58.371 --> 02:25:01.333]  Yeah, why don't they hire their own security for the hotel?
[02:25:01.333 --> 02:25:03.415]  And then they call the police if you trespass.
[02:25:03.937 --> 02:25:06.818]  You know, that would make sense now, wouldn't it?
[02:25:06.818 --> 02:25:14.820]  They kind of usurp the town, they block streets, they make it difficult for the average Joe and Josephine to go have breakfast, lunch, or dinner.
[02:25:14.820 --> 02:25:24.022]  I finally did this morning, nice and early at 8 o'clock, to see if there was a Build-A-Burger passed out in the corner or something.
[02:25:24.022 --> 02:25:26.003]  Did you dig through the trash?
[02:25:26.003 --> 02:25:28.003]  You know, that's the vital goodies.
[02:25:28.003 --> 02:25:30.524]  Yeah, I opened the trash and there was Henry Kissinger.
[02:25:33.069 --> 02:25:39.230]  You know, his arm sticking out or something, but no such macabre luck was upon me.
[02:25:39.230 --> 02:25:43.091]  But at any rate, you know, that's what's going on with the police.
[02:25:43.091 --> 02:25:44.411]  The union, they're not liking it.
[02:25:44.411 --> 02:25:47.072]  They got out of here.
[02:25:47.072 --> 02:25:50.473]  The police actually relaxed their security.
[02:25:50.473 --> 02:25:56.074]  I was told 11 o'clock last night local time was when the last police security left.
[02:25:56.694 --> 02:25:57.535]  We're good to go.
[02:26:27.355 --> 02:26:33.520]  One notable thing before I sign off, Alex, is that this is only the second time Bilderberg's ever met in Spain.
[02:26:33.520 --> 02:26:39.845]  The last time was 1989, and this is the first time in their entire history that Spanish media has done this.
[02:26:41.872 --> 02:26:42.873]  Well, it's incredible.
[02:26:42.873 --> 02:26:48.039]  I've seen press reports of a decade ago of national censorship over any mention of Bilderberg.
[02:26:48.039 --> 02:26:51.382]  They're very strong in Spain, because it is old world.
[02:26:51.382 --> 02:26:57.629]  Alright, we'll fire out the number for people if they want to get a hard copy of the weekly newspaper, American Free Press.
[02:26:57.629 --> 02:26:58.170]  It's excellent.
[02:26:58.931 --> 02:27:02.314]  It's 888-699-NEWS.
[02:27:02.314 --> 02:27:05.077]  That's 888-699-NEWS.
[02:27:05.077 --> 02:27:17.389]  You can ask for like a special Bilderberg edition from this year and past years or ask for the 16 weeks for 1776 ongoing trial subscription or go to AmericanFreePress.net.
[02:27:17.389 --> 02:27:19.311]  That's AmericanFreePress.net and that's
[02:27:19.731 --> 02:27:22.672]  Where we've got one or two videos linked or posted.
[02:27:22.672 --> 02:27:28.853]  A couple articles I've already posted and some stuff leading up to the Bilderberg Conference this year that Jim Tucker posted.
[02:27:28.853 --> 02:27:31.214]  And plenty more to come, hard copy and online.
[02:27:31.214 --> 02:27:32.474]  And I thank you for having me on.
[02:27:32.474 --> 02:27:38.056]  Well I appreciate you and appreciate your courage and certainly we've got to pat each other on the back.
[02:27:38.056 --> 02:27:40.316]  We're having more and more success against these people.
[02:27:40.316 --> 02:27:43.757]  And as soon as you get back I want to get you and Jim on together.
[02:27:43.757 --> 02:27:45.198]  Thank you so much Mr. Anderson.
[02:27:45.198 --> 02:27:45.958]  You have a great evening.
[02:27:46.238 --> 02:27:53.793]  Alright, we're going to get a quick pop-in for about 10 minutes with Charlie Skelton, then I'm going to cover some other news, take a few calls in the next segment, but we are...
[02:27:54.847 --> 02:28:00.611]  Two hours and 30 minutes into this transmission, I do want to remind listeners to also support this broadcast.
[02:28:00.611 --> 02:28:11.918]  I want to thank all of you that do buy the books and the videos and the t-shirts and the ball caps and the bumper stickers, which then supports the radio show, the website, the documentary films, all the work we do here.
[02:28:11.918 --> 02:28:20.484]  But more importantly, the books, the t-shirts, the bumper stickers, the films are all tailor-made to wake people up about the true nature of the planet.
[02:28:21.464 --> 02:28:22.485]  But it is a donation.
[02:28:22.485 --> 02:28:28.727]  I mean, that's how you support us when you buy Police State 4 The Rise of FEMA, to really be an expert on the police state control grid.
[02:28:28.727 --> 02:28:30.068]  The latest info.
[02:28:30.068 --> 02:28:34.729]  Follow the Republic to understand the banking takeover that is life and death for our economy.
[02:28:34.729 --> 02:28:37.711]  You expose this information, they will fall.
[02:28:37.711 --> 02:28:38.351]  Camp FEMA!
[02:28:39.304 --> 02:28:44.411]  Great documentary I consulted on, and that I'm in, that covers the FEMA camps.
[02:28:44.411 --> 02:28:48.357]  Invisible Empire, that Jason Burma's directed, 18 months in the making, I produced it.
[02:28:48.357 --> 02:28:55.847]  The New World Order, their history, their drug dealing, their child kidnapping, their pedophile rings, globalists admitting world government.

[02:29:51.669 --> 02:29:53.050]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.050 --> 02:29:55.591]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.591 --> 02:30:01.055]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.055 --> 02:30:02.716]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:30:02.716 --> 02:30:06.078]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.
[02:30:06.078 --> 02:30:11.301]  This is an American made product of the highest quality and compares to nothing you will find in stores.
[02:30:11.301 --> 02:30:14.743]  You can buy factory direct, shipped via UPS right to your door.
[02:30:14.743 --> 02:30:17.065]  Check them out on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[02:30:17.705 --> 02:30:21.228]  Or call 800-340-7091.
[02:30:21.228 --> 02:30:22.369]  Take my word for it.
[02:30:22.369 --> 02:30:25.032]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[02:30:25.032 --> 02:30:31.537]  Since 1947, Calbin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[02:30:31.537 --> 02:30:33.059]  Buy American and stay clean.

[02:30:54.424 --> 02:30:54.865]  Thank you!
[02:31:00.765 --> 02:31:05.748]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:31:05.748 --> 02:31:06.729]  What have we got?
[02:31:06.729 --> 02:31:09.170]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:31:09.170 --> 02:31:10.191]  A republic.
[02:31:10.191 --> 02:31:12.832]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:31:12.832 --> 02:31:15.114]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:31:15.114 --> 02:31:17.135]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:31:17.135 --> 02:31:18.796]  So they think they own our land?
[02:31:18.796 --> 02:31:20.117]  They think they own our water?
[02:31:20.117 --> 02:31:20.737]  Children?
[02:31:20.737 --> 02:31:21.858]  Our education?
[02:31:21.858 --> 02:31:22.679]  Our money?
[02:31:22.679 --> 02:31:26.341]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:31:26.701 --> 02:31:31.688]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:31:31.688 --> 02:31:32.709]  We have the facts.
[02:31:32.709 --> 02:31:33.851]  We have the Constitution.
[02:31:33.851 --> 02:31:34.772]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:31:34.772 --> 02:31:35.653]  We have common law.
[02:31:35.653 --> 02:31:38.177]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:31:38.177 --> 02:31:41.962]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[02:31:42.062 --> 02:31:47.005]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:31:47.005 --> 02:31:48.506]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:31:48.506 --> 02:31:49.586]  Don't tread on me.
[02:31:49.586 --> 02:31:56.470]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[02:32:00.532 --> 02:32:05.074]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:32:05.074 --> 02:32:05.995]  Number 1.
[02:32:05.995 --> 02:32:09.416]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:32:09.416 --> 02:32:10.276]  Number 2.
[02:32:10.276 --> 02:32:15.159]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:32:15.159 --> 02:32:15.919]  It's true.
[02:32:15.919 --> 02:32:20.781]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:32:20.781 --> 02:32:21.602]  Number 3.
[02:32:21.602 --> 02:32:25.183]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:32:25.183 --> 02:32:28.885]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:32:29.105 --> 02:32:29.905]  Number 4.
[02:32:29.905 --> 02:32:32.646]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:32:32.646 --> 02:32:36.327]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:32:36.327 --> 02:32:37.127]  Number 5.
[02:32:37.127 --> 02:32:41.268]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:32:41.268 --> 02:32:46.330]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:32:46.330 --> 02:32:50.491]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:50.491 --> 02:32:52.292]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:52.292 --> 02:32:56.893]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[02:32:57.313 --> 02:33:08.998]  I read the news today, oh boy About a lucky man who made the grade And though the news was rather sad
[02:33:35.525 --> 02:33:40.508]  Man, I tell you, Drudge Report just absolutely loves us now.
[02:33:40.508 --> 02:33:42.489]  We've had three links in the last three days.
[02:33:42.489 --> 02:33:48.952]  We've got two up there at the Drudge Report over on the right-hand side, DrudgeReport.com.
[02:33:48.952 --> 02:33:53.415]  I mean, every time he links, we get like a million extra hits, viewers, visits.
[02:33:54.775 --> 02:33:55.395]  It's amazing.
[02:33:55.395 --> 02:33:57.476]  It says, stop the New World Order.
[02:33:57.476 --> 02:34:03.018]  And he's got the great Charlie Skelton articles from the London Guardian, the biggest newspaper in Europe and England.
[02:34:03.018 --> 02:34:06.219]  Bilderberg 2010, between the sword and the wall.
[02:34:06.219 --> 02:34:09.900]  Protestors being detained, searched, grilled.
[02:34:09.900 --> 02:34:11.721]  And then final list of participants.
[02:34:13.042 --> 02:34:21.127]  And then we posted just a few paragraphs of a Bloomberg article with the excised subsection.
[02:34:21.127 --> 02:34:23.469]  It's a long article.
[02:34:23.469 --> 02:34:26.390]  Fed denies Bernanke attends Bilderberg.
[02:34:26.390 --> 02:34:35.516]  Now, when you actually go to the article, it says Goldman Sachs may explain PPT's vanishing act, Caroline Baum.
[02:34:37.617 --> 02:34:39.880]  And they say, where's the Plunge Protection Team?
[02:34:39.880 --> 02:34:41.141]  Why aren't they propping up?
[02:34:41.141 --> 02:34:43.824]  Where's the Federal Reserve rigging markets?
[02:34:43.824 --> 02:34:48.789]  And then you read down into the article and it's like, maybe people are upset there's a world government.
[02:34:48.789 --> 02:34:50.431]  Maybe there's something to this.
[02:34:50.431 --> 02:34:53.454]  Maybe they are destroying the economy by design.
[02:34:53.454 --> 02:34:54.575]  Maybe it's all true!
[02:34:55.476 --> 02:34:56.697]  Where's Bernanke?
[02:34:56.697 --> 02:35:01.119]  Bloomberg called and he's in Europe, but they won't say he was at Bilderberg.
[02:35:01.119 --> 02:35:08.742]  I mean, this is a rout of these people, because you've got all these Wall Street people going, hey, prop up my stock market!
[02:35:08.742 --> 02:35:11.023]  I know it's all rigged, so rig it!
[02:35:11.023 --> 02:35:14.805]  You don't understand, it's rigged to rob you.
[02:35:14.805 --> 02:35:22.088]  So, I mean, we're going to talk to Charlie Skelton for the rest of the hour here in just a moment, and then Paul Watson's coming up to sit in in the last hour.
[02:35:23.752 --> 02:35:26.073]  Oh, this is because I think he's a great talk show host.
[02:35:26.073 --> 02:35:32.436]  I think he's a great political brain, and I'm going to start making Watson do weekly reports, if you really want to know.
[02:35:32.436 --> 02:35:34.216]  Watson's been working with me for eight years.
[02:35:34.216 --> 02:35:39.959]  Fabulous work over at PrisonPlanet.com, so he'll be sitting in the last hour today and tomorrow.
[02:35:39.959 --> 02:35:43.780]  I want to tell you about a few sponsors, though, before we go any further.
[02:35:43.780 --> 02:35:46.401]  But guys, will you get Watson on during the next break?
[02:35:46.401 --> 02:35:49.282]  I must talk to him during the next break, so just have him on immediately.
[02:35:49.282 --> 02:35:49.563]  Thank you.
[02:35:51.630 --> 02:35:54.231]  We'll tell you about a few of the sponsors that made today's show possible.
[02:35:54.231 --> 02:35:57.293]  One of them is eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:35:57.293 --> 02:35:59.054]  The letter E and then foodsdirect.com.
[02:35:59.054 --> 02:36:01.875]  Big links up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[02:36:01.875 --> 02:36:05.697]  You'll never stand on a bread line, folks, if you own your own bread.
[02:36:05.697 --> 02:36:17.343]  And with all the depression and the wars and all the things they're trying to set up, 90, or if you want to be technical, 89% of the American people were agrarian or rural in the 1930s.
[02:36:19.716 --> 02:36:23.038]  Now we're 90% urban and 10% rural.
[02:36:23.038 --> 02:36:29.321]  Now, major universities estimate that millions starve to death over the 10-year depression.
[02:36:29.321 --> 02:36:31.982]  Grapes of wrath stuff, folks.
[02:36:31.982 --> 02:36:33.903]  You need to have storable food.
[02:36:33.903 --> 02:36:36.624]  Hopefully, you'll never have to use it, but I've got it.
[02:36:36.624 --> 02:36:39.325]  This is high-quality, non-GMO, non-hybrid.
[02:36:39.325 --> 02:36:40.566]  So, efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[02:36:40.566 --> 02:36:40.626]  800-409-5633.
[02:36:40.626 --> 02:36:41.186]  Do not screw around.
[02:36:41.186 --> 02:36:41.926]  Do not play games.
[02:36:47.509 --> 02:36:50.051]  And one other great sponsor I want to tell you about is Front Sight.
[02:36:50.051 --> 02:36:52.373]  Have you heard of the millionaire patriot, Dr. Ignatius Piazza?
[02:36:52.373 --> 02:36:55.855]  He's offering five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[02:36:55.855 --> 02:37:09.446]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Center with no drill instructor or tough guy attitude, family-oriented, for pennies on the dollar, and if you act fast, he will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[02:37:09.446 --> 02:37:11.527]  That's Front Sight, like the front of your rifle.
[02:37:11.527 --> 02:37:13.889]  FrontSight.com.
[02:37:13.889 --> 02:37:15.090]  It's one thing to own guns.
[02:37:15.230 --> 02:37:17.292]  It's another thing to know how to use them.
[02:37:17.292 --> 02:37:18.913]  FrontSite.com.
[02:37:18.913 --> 02:37:20.354]  You can't beat them.
[02:37:20.354 --> 02:37:23.096]  Alright, enough of my ranting.
[02:37:23.096 --> 02:37:28.721]  Jim Tucker, who has never steered us wrong, does have Bilderberg Group sources.
[02:37:28.721 --> 02:37:33.305]  Secretaries, assistants, financial planners, bankers.
[02:37:33.305 --> 02:37:35.186]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[02:37:35.186 --> 02:37:38.509]  Plus, he's snuck in and been shot at and stolen the trash many times.
[02:37:38.509 --> 02:37:41.011]  They've stolen their minutes, which have later been confirmed.
[02:37:42.826 --> 02:37:47.089]  He says they are almost completely unanimous greenlighting an Iran attack.
[02:37:47.089 --> 02:37:50.270]  That doesn't mean it's going to happen, but they need the political diversion.
[02:37:50.270 --> 02:37:52.431]  He also says it is a rout.
[02:37:52.431 --> 02:37:53.292]  They are panicking.
[02:37:53.292 --> 02:37:55.153]  A lot of them didn't attend.
[02:37:55.153 --> 02:38:00.236]  That dovetails with what Charlie Skelton said days before that he was there when he and his wife were kicked out.
[02:38:01.127 --> 02:38:13.972]  The last day, seeing Bilderberg head organizers, minions, with the top, you know, director badges, talking about, the dangerous rabble, the Alex Joneses, bullhorning us, did they attack?
[02:38:13.972 --> 02:38:17.153]  Heavens no, but that's what you get with a welfare state.
[02:38:17.153 --> 02:38:19.074]  They're able to have money to protest.
[02:38:19.074 --> 02:38:21.114]  They believe you having any job is a welfare state.
[02:38:21.114 --> 02:38:22.215]  They believe they own the planet.
[02:38:23.115 --> 02:38:23.355]  I think?
[02:38:43.633 --> 02:38:47.234]  Sucking at our carotid arteries with our blood spraying all over their face.
[02:38:47.234 --> 02:38:49.414]  You know, they're not having an orgy in our blood.
[02:38:49.414 --> 02:38:54.435]  We're at least waking up and trying to pull the succubus vampire off of our neck.
[02:38:54.435 --> 02:38:58.796]  Charlie Skelton, London Guardian reporter, thank you for joining us, sir.
[02:38:58.796 --> 02:38:59.156]  Thank you.
[02:38:59.156 --> 02:39:01.556]  Excuse me while I just pull this succubus vampire off my neck.
[02:39:01.556 --> 02:39:02.437]  Yeah, that's better.
[02:39:02.437 --> 02:39:02.737]  Thank you.
[02:39:02.737 --> 02:39:07.918]  Well, I mean, you have been near quite a nest of them hanging upside down by their clawed toes.
[02:39:07.918 --> 02:39:09.978]  Is that what succubi do?
[02:39:10.816 --> 02:39:11.456]  Yes, they do.
[02:39:11.456 --> 02:39:12.977]  They sit on your chest.
[02:39:12.977 --> 02:39:13.958]  You know what they do.
[02:39:13.958 --> 02:39:14.458]  Right.
[02:39:14.458 --> 02:39:15.098]  Yeah.
[02:39:15.098 --> 02:39:16.539]  I've been near enough.
[02:39:16.539 --> 02:39:17.800]  You're a literary man.
[02:39:17.800 --> 02:39:18.940]  You understand the succubus.
[02:39:18.940 --> 02:39:19.561]  Succubi.
[02:39:19.561 --> 02:39:20.641]  Succubus.
[02:39:20.641 --> 02:39:22.482]  The male and the female of the succubi clan.
[02:39:22.482 --> 02:39:28.765]  But seriously, you've been near the brain of the New World Order beast.
[02:39:28.765 --> 02:39:29.486]  A lot has happened.
[02:39:29.486 --> 02:39:31.327]  You have the floor hair skeleton.
[02:39:32.907 --> 02:39:42.814]  Well, talking of the brain of the Bilderberg beast, we have just been looking through our photographs now, and we are a little bit behind.
[02:39:42.814 --> 02:39:46.056]  We've had a rather difficult technical day, I would say.
[02:39:46.056 --> 02:39:52.461]  It's taken me all of today to fail to file ten amazing photographs to the Guardian.
[02:39:53.782 --> 02:39:55.083]  We've got many more.
[02:39:55.083 --> 02:39:58.185]  Yeah, you weren't able to get us photos through.
[02:39:58.185 --> 02:40:02.648]  Honestly, I don't quite know what's happening.
[02:40:02.648 --> 02:40:04.069]  We feel a little bit cursed today.
[02:40:04.069 --> 02:40:06.891]  I don't know if anyone else has had technical problems.
[02:40:06.891 --> 02:40:19.461]  Let me tell you, when I was at Bilderberg 2008, my phone kept messing up, and then I called my wife and talked to her, and then they called her back and said what I had just talked to her about, and it was the Bilderberg boys.
[02:40:20.421 --> 02:40:24.643]  We had people here that their GPS didn't work, they turned up in town and it just suddenly stopped.
[02:40:24.643 --> 02:40:26.404]  But anyway, who knows?
[02:40:26.404 --> 02:40:30.286]  Enough speculation, let's turn to fact.
[02:40:30.286 --> 02:40:41.893]  And we were very lucky to have had an extremely brave and resourceful photographer by the pseudonym of Kiro Sabour, who has been up in the hills
[02:40:42.991 --> 02:40:48.573]  And he got so close to the exiting Bilderbergers that he said he could hear them speaking.
[02:40:48.573 --> 02:40:51.493]  He said he could have reached out and touched the policeman.
[02:40:51.493 --> 02:40:54.014]  And we have got some pretty extraordinary photographs.
[02:40:54.014 --> 02:40:58.935]  Too bad we didn't have a shotgun microphone where you could have picked up what they were saying.
[02:40:58.935 --> 02:41:01.476]  Well, the funny thing is it makes a mockery of the idea that the
[02:41:02.658 --> 02:41:09.661]  The security has anything to do with protection, because this is a guy, he's never picked up a camera before in his life, let alone a gun.
[02:41:09.661 --> 02:41:18.705]  You know, he's a builder, and he crept through the undergrowth and sat there for the best part of 12 hours, snapping photographs.
[02:41:19.365 --> 02:41:21.547]  So, um, yeah.
[02:41:21.547 --> 02:41:29.975]  It's not about protecting them from, in inverted commas, terrorists, or some kind of terrifying threat of rabble.
[02:41:29.975 --> 02:41:32.578]  It's about keeping the press away and the people ignorant.
[02:41:32.578 --> 02:41:33.719]  But you know that.
[02:41:34.319 --> 02:41:49.203]  And, um, yeah, so we've just been looking at our photographs, just literally turned to a photograph just now, and, um, there in the shadows after a little bit, we tweaked a little bit the bit of the photograph, and, uh, yeah, we saw a rather interesting fellow there, which I'll tell you about later, but I could tell you some of the names I can confirm.
[02:41:49.203 --> 02:41:50.303]  No, no, tell me now!
[02:41:50.303 --> 02:41:54.104]  So you got Bernanke, and they're lying and saying he wasn't there?
[02:41:54.104 --> 02:41:56.065]  We haven't got him, but we have got, uh,
[02:41:58.540 --> 02:42:00.262]  We've got the nastiest man alive.
[02:42:00.262 --> 02:42:02.263]  Perhaps we've got Mr. Kissinger.
[02:42:02.263 --> 02:42:03.064]  Oh my gosh!
[02:42:03.064 --> 02:42:06.246]  Now, were you... He's a war criminal in Spain.
[02:42:06.246 --> 02:42:12.531]  So, brave lad to have come here and braved the possibility... Oh, that's right!
[02:42:12.531 --> 02:42:16.935]  He's been indicted as a war criminal and Herr Kissinger scurried in!
[02:42:17.475 --> 02:42:26.237]  Yeah, there's been a lot of speculation that he wouldn't show because, you know, why would you come to a country that has an arrest warrant out for you for war crimes?
[02:42:26.237 --> 02:42:28.498]  Which I think is the case, I say that, I think I'd be told that's the case.
[02:42:28.498 --> 02:42:38.340]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[02:42:39.071 --> 02:42:40.312]  What about Bill Gates?
[02:42:40.312 --> 02:42:40.973]  Did we see Mr. Eugenics?
[02:43:00.343 --> 02:43:05.306]  I think, I believe Monday Goes has been before a few times, but so yeah, anyway.
[02:43:05.306 --> 02:43:14.332]  Well, you know their whole new business model is forced inoculations and weather control, and so we know they were there pressing Spain to go ahead with the carbon tax.
[02:43:14.332 --> 02:43:14.632]  Right.
[02:43:15.667 --> 02:43:17.989]  Good, I'm sorry, I said, no, terrible.
[02:43:17.989 --> 02:43:32.821]  Obviously, I mean, it's just awful, and I was just thinking to myself how extraordinarily strategized in such a manner, and in fact you can... Yeah, we have the CEO of the biggest technology company on television saying he will control our weather.
[02:43:32.821 --> 02:43:39.267]  I mean, this is like a bad B-movie where you have the crazy guy, I'm taking over the earth, I will control the weather!
[02:43:41.288 --> 02:43:53.352]  I wish they could behave a little bit less like James Bond baddies.
[02:43:53.352 --> 02:44:01.715]  I mean, this year they were swept into an underground car park because they didn't want, you know, the few of us who were here to photograph them.
[02:44:01.715 --> 02:44:02.455]  I get really embarrassed.
[02:44:03.235 --> 02:44:15.437]  We keep seeing them sort of huddling down on the floor of limousines and holding handbags and newspapers to their faces and I'm thinking, is that what you do if you've just been meeting in order to try and make a better world?
[02:44:16.383 --> 02:44:17.244]  I don't think it is.
[02:44:17.244 --> 02:44:25.913]  I think if I'd just been spending four days strategizing for the good of mankind, I'd sort of be walking out of there thinking, hey, I might get a few pats on the back.
[02:44:25.913 --> 02:44:30.718]  But they crawl out and they slide out.
[02:44:30.718 --> 02:44:32.020]  Do you know what?
[02:44:32.020 --> 02:44:36.725]  My overarching emotion of this particular Bilderberg, last was probably fear.
[02:44:37.906 --> 02:44:42.509]  This has been absolute embarrassment and I just find the whole thing poignant.
[02:44:42.509 --> 02:44:46.151]  From the point of view of this, I just look at them and I go, really?
[02:44:46.151 --> 02:44:47.352]  Come on!
[02:44:47.352 --> 02:44:49.714]  That is not really how you behave as an adult.
[02:44:50.421 --> 02:45:02.744]  Well, they know they're setting up world government, usurping liberty and sovereignty, so of course they creep around and behave like rodents scurrying around in the dark of night from the bright lights of publicity.
[02:45:02.744 --> 02:45:08.785]  As David Rockefeller said in 1991, they couldn't have built this world government with the bright lights of publicity, and so they're like vampires.
[02:45:08.785 --> 02:45:11.025]  The lights of publicity ignites them.
[02:45:11.025 --> 02:45:13.706]  That's why I'm using the vampire metaphor.
[02:45:14.286 --> 02:45:19.573]  Now, Mr. Skelton, I have the American Free Press writer on, Mark Anderson.
[02:45:19.573 --> 02:45:28.286]  He said that it's in the local Spanish news that the police union of the Catalonia State Police are filing a complaint about being forced to guard these people.
[02:45:28.985 --> 02:45:52.388]  Oh yeah, and I reported in my last report that the head of the local police here in Stiches, I don't know if I've told you this, my brain is a little bit muddied after four days of madness, but they arrested a couple of guys on the hill, they took them into the police station and the chief of police stood there and said, we admire you, we admire what you're doing, I don't like the guys up there.
[02:45:53.118 --> 02:46:00.947]  And, yeah, I think there's not a lot of sympathy, actually, from the average Spaniard, and I include the police in that.
[02:46:00.947 --> 02:46:06.192]  And, interestingly, I had breakfast with one of the chauffeurs today.
[02:46:06.192 --> 02:46:10.877]  We were heading out to have breakfast at the hotel, but it was still locked.
[02:46:10.877 --> 02:46:14.441]  But one of the chauffeurs pulled up alongside me, and I said, oh, look, I was going to go for breakfast.
[02:46:14.441 --> 02:46:14.942]  And he said, oh, look,
[02:46:15.502 --> 02:46:16.383]  We're going to go over there.
[02:46:16.383 --> 02:46:18.904]  So I went and bought him a cup of coffee and we chatted.
[02:46:18.904 --> 02:46:24.787]  I didn't actually tell him I was a reporter, but we got talking and he gave me a couple of interesting things.
[02:46:24.787 --> 02:46:39.794]  There's a name off the list, a name he identified as someone that isn't on either of the two slightly varying lists of delegates, which is some powerful Spanish lady called Donna Esperanza something or other.
[02:46:39.794 --> 02:46:41.735]  And he also told us more interestingly that
[02:46:42.655 --> 02:46:57.148]  He'd been speaking to the police and he said this with great conviction, but obviously this is third hand from a chauffeur, so you know, take it with however many grains of salt as you want, but he said that the cost of the security alone for the conference was 10 million euros.
[02:46:57.148 --> 02:46:59.390]  Now, I don't know if that's the case.
[02:46:59.390 --> 02:47:05.155]  Oh, it was 900 and something million with the G20 last year here in the US.
[02:47:05.155 --> 02:47:05.416]  Really?
[02:47:05.416 --> 02:47:06.056]  My goodness.
[02:47:08.918 --> 02:47:10.199]  How do you spend $900 million?
[02:47:10.199 --> 02:47:15.680]  I say that, we're hosting the Olympics for $13 billion or however much it is, so yeah, I shouldn't ask stupid questions.
[02:47:15.680 --> 02:47:22.022]  Yeah, well, in fact guys, I want to be sure, pull that article up, it was $900 million spent on G20 security.
[02:47:22.022 --> 02:47:27.204]  I believe that's for all their past meetings in the last year, but I want to be, that $900 million number was there.
[02:47:27.204 --> 02:47:32.566]  I know it was above $90 million, yeah.
[02:47:32.566 --> 02:47:34.146]  Because I'm not adding a zero.
[02:47:34.146 --> 02:47:36.907]  We're going to check that right now, but Mr. Skelton, what else happened?
[02:47:38.357 --> 02:47:39.277]  Uh, what else happened?
[02:47:39.277 --> 02:47:44.258]  Uh, well, we've, uh, we've been handing out our t-shirts, which has been, it's been very positive, by the way.
[02:47:44.258 --> 02:47:50.120]  I'd like to say the main thing that's happened is it's been a really, a really warm, positive experience for, I think, everyone who's been here.
[02:47:50.120 --> 02:48:07.144]  That we had some people that came as a result of your broadcast, we've had some people that, a few people that came because of what I wrote last year, um, some people that have just started reading about this kind of thing, and a lot of young people, a lot of very excited, interested, concerned people, and we just had a really good time.
[02:48:07.144 --> 02:48:07.644]  I know in a sense,
[02:48:08.582 --> 02:48:17.987]  It sounds like you shouldn't have a good time at a place like this, and last year I had such a ghastly, dystopian, awful time, which drove me half mad as I was chased around Athens.
[02:48:17.987 --> 02:48:36.255]  But this year, it's been, you know, sitting up late into the night with a bunch of great people talking about things, and seeing a great increase in numbers of people who've come from all across the world to this event to bear witness to it, and most importantly of all, a great, a huge increase in press.
[02:48:36.255 --> 02:48:37.136]  I mean, genuinely, just
[02:48:38.377 --> 02:48:39.958]  It is properly a breakthrough.
[02:48:39.958 --> 02:48:45.200]  I was speaking to a Spanish guy just the other day who'd come and he was helping us.
[02:48:45.200 --> 02:48:51.182]  He was helping us translate some leaflets into Spanish and he was just saying, you know, I was speaking to my dad.
[02:48:51.182 --> 02:48:57.564]  They were talking about it on the, he said, oh, they're just talking about it now on the radio, one of the main radio stations in Spain.
[02:48:57.564 --> 02:48:58.905]  Everyone's talking about it.
[02:48:58.905 --> 02:49:01.846]  The chauffeur I was talking to said, yeah, everyone's talking about it.
[02:49:01.846 --> 02:49:05.908]  He said, I don't know if it's because the people at the hotel are talking, but everyone's talking about Bilderberg.
[02:49:07.268 --> 02:49:10.689]  You just feel like everyone's talking about it.
[02:49:10.689 --> 02:49:24.154]  Well that's it, I mean we've gone from being called kooks a decade ago, there's no elite, nobody's meeting, you even a year and a half ago before you first went thought it was a joke you said, to now, I mean it's all over Bloomberg, New York Times, Drudge Report,
[02:49:25.335 --> 02:49:31.060]  I mean, even Bloomberg says, yeah, it does look like Goldman Sachs is trying to destroy things by design.
[02:49:31.060 --> 02:49:35.424]  And they quote our blogs, our articles, and say it does look it's by design.
[02:49:35.424 --> 02:49:41.829]  And so many times I say something and it's so incredible, Charlie Skelton, I can't even believe it.
[02:49:41.829 --> 02:49:42.390]  I said 900 million.
[02:49:44.011 --> 02:49:44.992]  Excuse me.
[02:49:44.992 --> 02:49:51.975]  That's what the security at the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania cost.
[02:49:51.975 --> 02:50:01.960]  The Toronto Globe reports, and I put into the search engine G20 security cost, $1 billion is what it's going to cost.
[02:50:01.960 --> 02:50:09.123]  It says the cost of security for the summit is expected to increase five-fold over estimates and reach $1 billion.
[02:50:09.123 --> 02:50:11.364]  That's extraordinary.
[02:50:12.737 --> 02:50:13.298]  I do, I do.
[02:50:13.298 --> 02:50:14.759]  I mean, why not just 10 billion?
[02:50:14.759 --> 02:50:15.379]  Why not 100 billion?
[02:50:15.379 --> 02:50:19.283]  I mean, when you're making up numbers like that, why not just screw us for a little bit more?
[02:50:19.283 --> 02:50:34.675]  But I mean, you get 20 bankers who are the real presidents, the real rulers, they show up, they lock down Pittsburgh, they lock down whole cities in Canada, they bring in 50,000 cops, and literally it costs a billion dollars.
[02:50:34.675 --> 02:50:38.719]  I mean... To be fair, a billion dollars isn't worth what it used to be.
[02:50:40.083 --> 02:50:44.367]  Yeah, but, I mean, that's probably, a billion dollars is the whole budget of the city of Austin every year.
[02:50:44.367 --> 02:50:47.210]  It's just, it's just awful.
[02:50:47.210 --> 02:50:48.872]  Charlie, stay there.

[02:54:04.212 --> 02:54:08.933]  I'm literally gibbering like a schoolgirl.
[02:54:08.933 --> 02:54:10.154]  I'm just twittering about.
[02:54:13.636 --> 02:54:19.002]  And I mean that by twittering in the post-cyber-twittered way.
[02:54:19.002 --> 02:54:24.969]  With the fact that every intel source we've got says the whole globalist agenda is in trouble, it's falling apart.
[02:54:24.969 --> 02:54:33.298]  That doesn't mean they're not dominating us, they aren't in control of us, but the world, as Zbigniew Brzezinski said three weeks ago, is now awake to their agenda.
[02:54:34.865 --> 02:54:39.028]  And the people are now getting faith that we can turn the tide against these people.
[02:54:39.028 --> 02:54:44.252]  And it's that understanding of who the true elite are that is our salvation against corruption.
[02:54:44.252 --> 02:54:50.016]  Going back to Charlie Skelton and the time we have left with him, and Paul Watson joining us via video Skype is coming up.
[02:54:50.016 --> 02:54:54.259]  Charlie, I can only commend you and your journey of awakening.
[02:54:54.259 --> 02:54:57.801]  And so much has happened, so much is going on.
[02:54:57.801 --> 02:55:00.784]  You did report, though, that there were people being detained and arrested.
[02:55:00.784 --> 02:55:02.665]  What happened on that front?
[02:55:02.665 --> 02:55:03.986]  Well, look, I have to repeat.
[02:55:04.739 --> 02:55:18.065]  It was, it started a little bit but it just tailed off and it was, everyone I've spoken to and that includes the few people that were arrested and the ones that were tended to be, you know, 30 yards away from the hotel with a long lens.
[02:55:18.065 --> 02:55:21.227]  No one had a problem and I didn't, one of the things I, no one had a big problem.
[02:55:21.227 --> 02:55:30.671]  One of the things I should say is that the guys that were arrested and taken to the Chief of Police who told them that he admired them, you know, he looked at their footage and he just handed it back.
[02:55:30.671 --> 02:55:33.153]  He handed the camera back and didn't delete his footage.
[02:55:33.153 --> 02:55:33.613]  You know, so that's,
[02:55:34.746 --> 02:55:38.288]  It's a different kind of experience.
[02:55:38.288 --> 02:55:50.156]  I'm not saying that police forces the world over aren't brutal sometimes, but this year we've had a very good and positive experience with the police.
[02:55:50.156 --> 02:55:55.239]  It's hard to pick, there's so many different positives to draw from Bilderberg 2010.
[02:55:55.239 --> 02:55:59.502]  One of them, and perhaps you could argue the most important, is a good relationship with the police.
[02:55:59.502 --> 02:56:03.064]  Because if that relationship falls over, then it all falls over for us.
[02:56:04.636 --> 02:56:07.337]  Well, it certainly does.
[02:56:07.337 --> 02:56:08.978]  Other key points I haven't asked.
[02:56:08.978 --> 02:56:11.259]  Other important pieces of intel.
[02:56:11.259 --> 02:56:18.122]  Can you give us any foreshadowing of what's coming up in your final Bilderberg 2010 report for The Guardian?
[02:56:18.122 --> 02:56:18.862]  Yeah, I can.
[02:56:18.862 --> 02:56:25.765]  Apart from some more pictures, we've got a game called, which your listeners may enjoy playing, called Spot the Delegate.
[02:56:25.765 --> 02:56:29.627]  Because there's a few there that we do know, but we're not letting on.
[02:56:29.627 --> 02:56:33.289]  There's quite a few delegates that we can recognize from their particular lanyards.
[02:56:34.104 --> 02:56:34.504]  Good.
[02:56:34.504 --> 02:56:37.667]  What's the headline on that Spot the Bilderberg delegate?
[02:56:56.673 --> 02:56:57.153]  Yeah.
[02:56:57.153 --> 02:56:58.094]  Alright, in your blog.
[02:56:58.094 --> 02:57:04.720]  So it's not up yet, but it's going up as soon as you get those emails to The Guardian, the biggest newspaper in Europe.
[02:57:04.720 --> 02:57:08.463]  Okay, now, lastly, what about your mock press conference?
[02:57:08.463 --> 02:57:10.925]  That's a good way to point out how ridiculous this is.
[02:57:10.925 --> 02:57:23.235]  Okay, I'm just going to backtrack very slightly, very quickly, and say, you know, another amazing thing, I just looked at The Guardian website page where it says the most viewed pages on the website, and
[02:57:25.304 --> 02:57:33.049]  One of my reports about Bilderberg was the second most well-read, most-reviewed report on The Guardian the last 24 hours.
[02:57:33.049 --> 02:57:34.790]  And that's the whole newspaper.
[02:57:34.790 --> 02:57:45.238]  And, you know, that's just extraordinary to think that that amount of traffic, that amount of forwarding around... Because The Guardian is numero uno.
[02:57:45.238 --> 02:57:48.520]  It's the number one, from what I've read, English paper in Europe and England.
[02:57:49.665 --> 02:57:54.048]  English speaking.
[02:57:54.048 --> 02:57:59.191]  Well, it's that or the Times of London, and from what I've read, The Guardian has a bigger readership.
[02:57:59.775 --> 02:58:06.538]  Yeah, no, I mean, online, certainly, and, you know, these days that's perhaps the most important place to be.
[02:58:06.538 --> 02:58:13.582]  But yeah, in terms of the press conference we held, you know, it was a little bit of a stunt, but actually it turned into quite a useful thing.
[02:58:13.582 --> 02:58:19.825]  We were staying at a caravan park, we set up a press office in our hut, Bungalow 19,
[02:58:21.606 --> 02:58:28.091]  We started handing out lanyards, and we started handing out information, and showing photographs of delegates.
[02:58:28.091 --> 02:58:30.173]  You know, if you spot these guys, let us know.
[02:58:30.173 --> 02:58:33.075]  And basically, you know, a bit of background on Bilderberg.
[02:58:33.075 --> 02:58:37.999]  And, you know, we essentially were making the point that... I'll tell you what, Charlie, we're back in one minute.
[02:58:37.999 --> 02:58:39.360]  Do three more minutes with us.
[02:58:39.360 --> 02:58:40.380]  I want you to be able to finish.
[02:58:40.380 --> 02:58:46.585]  You are listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.585 --> 02:58:48.747]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.769 --> 02:58:54.791]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:58:54.791 --> 02:59:00.113]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:59:00.113 --> 02:59:02.174]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:59:02.174 --> 02:59:07.157]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:59:07.157 --> 02:59:08.358]  How much do you want?
[02:59:08.358 --> 02:59:09.478]  When do you want it?
[02:59:09.478 --> 02:59:11.359]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:59:11.359 --> 02:59:12.440]  When will you need it?
[02:59:12.440 --> 02:59:14.641]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:59:14.641 --> 02:59:15.982]  Will there be any food?
[02:59:15.982 --> 02:59:17.502]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:59:17.502 --> 02:59:18.543]  If there's a quarantine,
[02:59:18.703 --> 02:59:20.045]  And you can't feed yourself.
[02:59:20.045 --> 02:59:22.768]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:59:22.768 --> 02:59:26.352]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:59:26.352 --> 02:59:30.176]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:59:30.176 --> 02:59:31.398]  How much will you need?
[02:59:31.398 --> 02:59:32.299]  We don't know.
[02:59:32.299 --> 02:59:33.400]  How much do you want?
[02:59:33.400 --> 02:59:34.141]  All you can get.
[02:59:34.141 --> 02:59:35.142]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:59:35.422 --> 02:59:38.463]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:59:38.463 --> 02:59:40.664]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:59:40.664 --> 02:59:41.704]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:41.704 --> 02:59:42.884]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:42.884 --> 02:59:44.705]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:05.509 --> 03:00:05.649]  Yeah.
[03:00:17.586 --> 03:00:22.608]  One of my crew speaks fluent Spanish and Portuguese, being from Brazil.
[03:00:22.608 --> 03:00:25.349]  And he did go to the Spanish newspapers and did confirm.
[03:00:25.349 --> 03:00:26.710]  It's all over the place.
[03:00:26.710 --> 03:00:28.911]  Police deployment cost 600,000 euros.
[03:00:28.911 --> 03:00:40.135]  And multiple police agencies and the conclave of CJEZ and others complained and said they should have their own security and called us if there was a problem.
[03:00:40.135 --> 03:00:43.397]  We don't like guarding these people and bankrupting.
[03:00:43.397 --> 03:00:46.258]  And the police just had their pay cut all over the nation.
[03:00:47.058 --> 03:00:48.059]  So, that's going on.
[03:00:48.059 --> 03:00:54.365]  Here is the actual Spanish, publico.es, one of the big papers over there.
[03:00:54.365 --> 03:01:01.753]  And it's, I can't speak Spanish, but it's el despalingo politico cuesta 600,000 euros.
[03:01:01.753 --> 03:01:03.554]  Did I butcher that well?
[03:01:03.554 --> 03:01:04.375]  You like that Spanish?
[03:01:06.137 --> 03:01:12.522]  Hey, Phil, Philbert, come on in here and you read the headline in Spanish to folks on the mic over there.
[03:01:12.522 --> 03:01:14.143]  We'll get you to read the Spanish headline.
[03:01:14.143 --> 03:01:20.948]  Charlie Skelton, we were talking during the break, you said that there's overall a feeling by all the media that this was a major breakthrough this year.
[03:01:20.948 --> 03:01:24.231]  Can you finish up with that and what happened with your little press conference?
[03:01:25.413 --> 03:01:32.501]  So, press conference was just a bit of fun, but you know, a bit of pointed fun because, you know, if they're not going to handle their press, we'll handle it for them.
[03:01:32.501 --> 03:01:46.597]  But I'd like to say in terms of the good feeling and in terms of the positive feeling that people have drawn from this, I'd like for me to tell your listeners what to do, Alex, but what I would like them to do if they've ever thought about having a worthwhile holiday.
[03:01:47.317 --> 03:02:00.249]  And if you've ever thought about coming to a perfectly extraordinary event and meeting some amazing people and doing something that's important and sometimes exciting, sometimes frightening, but just a significant thing, then I would say
[03:02:00.959 --> 03:02:08.985]  When we find out, whoever finds out, when Bilderberg 2011 comes along and where it is, you know, find a little bit of extra cash.
[03:02:08.985 --> 03:02:12.087]  If you can't go club together, send one person.
[03:02:12.087 --> 03:02:14.889]  Come along and join in with everyone.
[03:02:14.889 --> 03:02:15.409]  I agree.
[03:02:15.409 --> 03:02:21.954]  By the way, that's why they've announced that they want government to only allow essential travel.
[03:02:21.954 --> 03:02:24.836]  I mean, they want to lock us down in a neo-feudal state.
[03:02:24.836 --> 03:02:26.698]  Here's the headline in Spanish from Spain.
[03:02:26.698 --> 03:02:26.978]  Go ahead.
[03:02:29.411 --> 03:02:31.632]  We gotta turn his mic on, guys.
[03:02:31.632 --> 03:02:38.654]  Go ahead now.
[03:02:38.654 --> 03:02:41.154]  Yeah, I don't think his mic's on.
[03:02:41.154 --> 03:02:43.055]  But, well, it doesn't matter.
[03:02:43.055 --> 03:02:45.796]  Screaming across the room, everybody can hear it in Spanish.
[03:02:45.796 --> 03:02:51.737]  Go ahead, Phil.
[03:02:51.737 --> 03:02:52.418]  Alright.
[03:02:52.418 --> 03:02:54.178]  Hey, thanks a lot, bro.
[03:02:54.178 --> 03:02:56.759]  Hey, that's exciting, Charlie, that the police are awake.
[03:02:58.175 --> 03:03:09.110]  Well, I wouldn't say that, but I mean, uh, uh, sympathetic and some, uh, you know, some are, some are saying, you know, I'm reading books about this, you know, people, yes, there is, you know, there's an awakening happening.
[03:03:09.110 --> 03:03:10.952]  Well, I say that I really think so.
[03:03:10.952 --> 03:03:11.533]  I think so.
[03:03:11.533 --> 03:03:11.754]  Yeah.
[03:03:11.754 --> 03:03:12.835]  I mean, that doesn't mean they're all awake.
[03:03:12.955 --> 03:03:15.056]  But compared to what it was, this is an awakening.
[03:03:15.056 --> 03:03:16.216]  Well, we commend you.
[03:03:16.216 --> 03:03:18.237]  We can't wait to see your spot, The Delegate.
[03:03:18.237 --> 03:03:21.538]  They're on The Guardian, number one or number two story on the site.
[03:03:21.538 --> 03:03:25.479]  I would imagine all your stories together in the aggregate are the biggest story right now on The Guardian.
[03:03:25.479 --> 03:03:27.259]  Thank you so much, Charlie Skelton.
[03:03:27.259 --> 03:03:28.500]  God bless you, my friend.
[03:03:28.500 --> 03:03:29.000]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:03:29.740 --> 03:03:31.061]  Amazing job from him.
[03:03:31.061 --> 03:03:33.943]  What a great idea to everybody to go to the next Bilderberg meeting.
[03:03:33.943 --> 03:03:48.112]  Instead of having a few hundred people, how about a few hundred thousand telling the rulers of the planet that they have gotten their power through ill-gotten gain and that we are taking our liberty back from these globalists that are using communism to take control of our lives.
[03:03:48.112 --> 03:03:51.715]  Now going to Paul Watson who will host the balance of the transmission.
[03:03:51.715 --> 03:03:56.778]  Joining us via video Skype for PrisonPlanet.tv members and radio listeners is Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:03:56.778 --> 03:03:59.440]  Paul, what's coming up in the next 55 minutes after we come back?
[03:04:00.922 --> 03:04:05.847]  Well, Alex, we've got a huge new Bilderberg story.
[03:04:05.847 --> 03:04:07.529]  I'm very excited about this one.
[03:04:07.529 --> 03:04:10.813]  I think it's probably, in terms of
[03:04:11.849 --> 03:04:18.593]  Not coming from leaks that journalists have got out of Bilderberg, but directly from Bilderberg members themselves.
[03:04:18.593 --> 03:04:34.222]  I think it's probably the biggest story, certainly of this year, and it's going to answer a lot of debunkers who have attempted to claim that Bilderberg has no power and no influence over world events.
[03:04:34.222 --> 03:04:36.423]  All right, so you've got some new breaking news.
[03:04:36.423 --> 03:04:37.484]  I haven't even heard this yet.
[03:04:37.484 --> 03:04:39.265]  Did it just go up on PrisonPlanet.com?
[03:04:40.518 --> 03:04:42.780]  It's going up straight after the show.
[03:04:42.780 --> 03:04:43.981]  Oh, so you're not even done yet.
[03:04:43.981 --> 03:04:46.343]  You're going to be riding it during the breaks.
[03:04:46.343 --> 03:04:50.226]  I've written the article, but it's going up as soon as I get off the air.
[03:04:50.226 --> 03:04:51.867]  Well, you need to dare in the next break.
[03:04:51.867 --> 03:04:53.489]  Put it up, Watson.
[03:04:53.489 --> 03:04:57.392]  All right, Paul Joseph Watson hosting the show is Maiden Voyage.
[03:04:57.392 --> 03:04:59.013]  Thanks for joining us straight ahead.
[03:04:59.013 --> 03:05:00.455]  We'll be right back.
[03:05:02.998 --> 03:05:06.959]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:05:06.959 --> 03:05:15.820]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[03:05:15.820 --> 03:05:20.441]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[03:05:20.441 --> 03:05:31.263]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[03:05:31.903 --> 03:05:41.406]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:05:41.406 --> 03:05:46.848]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.

[03:05:54.331 --> 03:05:57.072]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[03:06:00.879 --> 03:06:05.442]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered generator.
[03:06:05.442 --> 03:06:06.363]  Number 1.
[03:06:06.363 --> 03:06:09.786]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:06:09.786 --> 03:06:10.646]  Number 2.
[03:06:10.646 --> 03:06:15.530]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:06:15.530 --> 03:06:16.270]  It's true.
[03:06:16.270 --> 03:06:21.154]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:06:21.154 --> 03:06:21.975]  Number 3.
[03:06:21.975 --> 03:06:25.557]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:06:25.557 --> 03:06:29.260]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:06:29.460 --> 03:06:30.261]  Number 4.
[03:06:30.261 --> 03:06:33.024]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:06:33.024 --> 03:06:36.708]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:06:36.708 --> 03:06:37.488]  Number 5.
[03:06:37.488 --> 03:06:41.633]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:06:41.633 --> 03:06:46.398]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[03:07:04.906 --> 03:07:10.909]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calvin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[03:07:11.289 --> 03:07:18.694]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[03:07:18.694 --> 03:07:23.557]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[03:07:32.242 --> 03:07:35.965]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[03:07:36.485 --> 03:07:43.251]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[03:07:43.251 --> 03:07:47.154]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[03:07:47.154 --> 03:07:52.899]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[03:07:52.899 --> 03:07:53.140]  Thank you!
[03:08:02.245 --> 03:08:05.008]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:08:05.008 --> 03:08:19.700]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:19.700 --> 03:08:20.881]  Hello, folks.
[03:08:20.881 --> 03:08:25.665]  I'm welcome to the final hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:27.315 --> 03:08:32.916]  My name is Paul Joseph Watson, editor and writer for PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:08:32.916 --> 03:08:42.778]  Alex is away working on his upcoming documentary, so the final 50 or so minutes of the show, I'll be sitting in for Alex.
[03:08:42.778 --> 03:08:46.959]  And we've got huge breaking Bilderberg news.
[03:08:46.959 --> 03:08:52.400]  The debunkers have been out in the past few days in the London Telegraph and on Russia Today.
[03:08:53.340 --> 03:09:18.503]  Lying and claiming that Bilderberg has no power, these 200 or so elitists from the pinnacle of their respective establishments, from academia, from the media, from government, from corporations, from the banking system, they say that basically these 200 people get together and they just discuss tiddler winks or something, they just talk about the weather.
[03:09:19.852 --> 03:09:24.453]  You have debunkers claiming that Bilderberg wields no power over global affairs.
[03:09:25.762 --> 03:09:36.609]  Well, that's been proven completely inaccurate with a new story that's going up on PrisonPlanet.com within the next half an hour or so.
[03:09:36.609 --> 03:09:53.420]  And it's a big admission from a Bilderberg member on what really happens at Bilderberg and exactly how much power and influence the Bilderberg group does wield over current affairs.
[03:09:53.420 --> 03:09:53.600]  Now,
[03:09:54.960 --> 03:09:58.623]  This comes from a Belgian radio station.
[03:09:58.623 --> 03:10:02.366]  It's a mainstream Belgian radio station.
[03:10:02.366 --> 03:10:12.054]  And they were interviewing former NATO Secretary and two-time Bilderberg attendee, Willy Klaas.
[03:10:12.054 --> 03:10:16.017]  Now, this guy was a former top minister in Belgium.
[03:10:16.017 --> 03:10:18.919]  As I said, he was NATO Secretary General from 1994 to 1995.
[03:10:22.402 --> 03:10:33.269]  Um, and he gave an interview on a mainstream Belgium radio station, and this was also reported on by the Belgian news website, uh, zoniewin.be.
[03:10:33.269 --> 03:10:39.192]  And we've got the translation of the quotes in this article that's coming up on prisonplanet.com.
[03:10:39.192 --> 03:10:43.195]  And, uh, Willie Class told the host that
[03:10:44.056 --> 03:10:49.258]  Bilderberg does indeed decide policy for the coming year.
[03:10:49.258 --> 03:10:50.839]  That's a translated quote.
[03:10:50.839 --> 03:10:54.401]  Bilderberg does indeed decide policy for the coming year.
[03:10:56.553 --> 03:11:04.116]  And he would obviously be in a position to know because he's been to Bilderberg on two separate occasions and he was the 8th Secretary General of NATO.
[03:11:04.116 --> 03:11:08.798]  He was a bigwig and he's also a top Foreign Affairs Minister for Belgium.
[03:11:08.798 --> 03:11:19.762]  Now why is this important that a current and former NATO Secretary, a current Bilderberg member, Willy Klaas, admits that Bilderberg decides global policy?
[03:11:20.962 --> 03:11:40.596]  Well because over the last few days you've had both the London Telegraph, a guy called Chip Belay, who appeared on Russia Today, and we're going to play that clip in a minute, claim that Bilderberg has no power over global affairs whatsoever and the meeting has no significance at all.
[03:11:41.877 --> 03:11:59.069]  Now, we can go through the leaks that emerge out of Bilderberg meetings that are got by journalists there on the scene, but really the golden nugget is the fact that a Bilderberg member admits that they do set global policy.
[03:11:59.069 --> 03:12:04.933]  And Klaas said during this radio interview, quote, at first he said that
[03:12:06.440 --> 03:12:16.025]  Each Bilderberg guest is given around 10 minutes of talk time in which they compile their presentation to fellow Bilderberg members at the conference.
[03:12:16.025 --> 03:12:26.170]  And then he said, quote, the participants are then obviously considered to use this report in setting their policies in environments which they affect.
[03:12:27.435 --> 03:12:30.958]  And that's the direct translation of what he said.
[03:12:30.958 --> 03:12:48.715]  The participants are considered to use this report, so they use the report that the Bilderberg organisers have written up from their 10-minute speech, and then each individual Bilderberg member is mandated to enact that policy within their respective member nation.
[03:12:48.715 --> 03:12:52.939]  So this undemocratic, unelected, secretive elite
[03:12:53.499 --> 03:13:01.905]  does formulate the consensus which goes directly to forming policy in major Western and worldwide countries.
[03:13:04.278 --> 03:13:32.120]  This was sent to us by a Dutch-speaking reader who's a Belgian and he confirms that the translation is accurate and we've got the translation of his quotes in this article that's coming up and it represents a solid confirmation of basically everything that we've seen come out of Bilderberg in recent years whereby the leaks of what is to happen in global policy in terms of the economy, the environment,
[03:13:32.600 --> 03:13:38.183]  War and other sectors of global policy play out over the next 12 months.
[03:13:38.183 --> 03:13:55.092]  We've documented this many times with the oil prices, the 2002 Bilderberg meeting which delayed the invasion of Iraq until 2003 and many other areas which we'll go on to explore in detail later.
[03:13:56.192 --> 03:14:10.259]  So this is a confirmation from a Bilderberg member that the group sets policy in a completely undemocratic and illegal manner behind closed doors, behind a steel ring of security.
[03:14:10.259 --> 03:14:19.443]  And this completely confounds the claims of people like Chip Belay who appeared on Russia Today a couple of days ago to claim that
[03:14:20.664 --> 03:14:32.197]  The notion that the Bildberg Group had any power over global affairs was a fairy tale, a myth, expounded by mainly racists and anti-Semites.
[03:14:32.197 --> 03:14:37.022]  And we're going to go to this clip now and then analyse the propaganda in a minute.
[03:14:37.022 --> 03:14:41.287]  So we play this clip of Chip Vallee on Russia Today now.
[03:14:41.949 --> 03:14:47.552]  We're joined by Chib Belay, an investigative journalist and sceptic, indeed as he is, of the Bilderberg conspiracy theorists.
[03:14:47.552 --> 03:14:49.253]  Mr. Belay, evening to you.
[03:14:49.253 --> 03:14:55.157]  Well, as we saw there, the gathering's been held in Spain this year, a country that's, of course, no stranger to the tough economic times of late.
[03:14:55.157 --> 03:15:00.179]  As we just heard in that report, even worries it could go the same way as Greece down the financial plughole.
[03:15:00.179 --> 03:15:06.823]  Is that the type of story, the type of thing that's going to be topping the agenda of the Bilderberg meeting over the last two days?
[03:15:06.823 --> 03:15:09.525]  Even tonight, of course, as we heard, the euro's trading at a four-year low.
[03:15:12.884 --> 03:15:27.647]  People have every right to be angry at financial networks and they have every right to demand accountability, but this idea that the Bilderberger Group is a secret elite force that controls the world economy and is building a new world order is
[03:15:28.107 --> 03:15:32.090]  A giant pot of spoiled borscht made from rotten beets.
[03:15:32.090 --> 03:15:33.991]  These claims go back to the late 1700s.
[03:15:33.991 --> 03:15:36.753]  There are a lot of malarkey.
[03:15:36.753 --> 03:15:40.675]  There are 15 or 20 other similar groups that have secret meetings.
[03:15:40.675 --> 03:15:44.778]  Most meetings between corporate leaders and government officials are secret.
[03:15:44.778 --> 03:15:46.499]  The press is not invited to them.
[03:15:46.499 --> 03:15:53.944]  This is a hoax carried out by people who believe in an elaborate fairy tale about how power is exercised in the world.
[03:15:54.104 --> 03:16:02.368]  Well hang on Chip, if you were to put your PR advisor's hat on tonight, don't you think there's anything remotely sinister about this annual meeting?
[03:16:02.368 --> 03:16:06.670]  But no matter that it goes on every year, we don't know what's contained in it.
[03:16:06.670 --> 03:16:08.170]  It's not really great PR, is it?
[03:16:08.170 --> 03:16:13.933]  To shroud themselves with all this secrecy and tight security is bound to breed conspiracy theories.
[03:16:13.933 --> 03:16:15.474]  Why is the group so camera shy then?
[03:16:18.649 --> 03:16:20.190]  Well, look, of course you're right.
[03:16:20.190 --> 03:16:25.893]  From a PR perspective, it's idiotic to have secret meetings with secret guest lists and a secret agenda.
[03:16:25.893 --> 03:16:34.058]  So, of course that encourages conspiracy theories, but you also have the Trilateral Commission, you have the Council on Foreign Relations, you have the Club of Rome.
[03:16:34.318 --> 03:16:42.643]  You have dozens of dozens of these elite formations, and yes, they talk over policy, but the organization itself has no power.
[03:16:42.643 --> 03:16:49.966]  Powerful people with huge security apparatus show up at these hotels, and of course they lock down the hotels.
[03:16:49.966 --> 03:16:51.807]  You know, I'm an investigative reporter.
[03:16:51.807 --> 03:16:52.568]  I'm annoying.
[03:16:52.568 --> 03:16:56.270]  I try and sneak into meetings, and of course security keeps me out.
[03:16:56.270 --> 03:17:02.053]  This fantastic set of allegations is a stage play for the reporters.
[03:17:02.193 --> 03:17:06.175]  Yes, but these are, as you just said yourself, are powerful people with a lot of world influence.
[03:17:06.175 --> 03:17:11.018]  Surely they're going to take back to their respective camps some of what they've talked about at said meeting.
[03:17:11.018 --> 03:17:13.420]  And that is going to have an effect on the global scene, isn't it?
[03:17:15.828 --> 03:17:20.971]  And that effect will be covered by the media of dozens and dozens of nations.
[03:17:20.971 --> 03:17:27.835]  And the policies that are formulated don't hold any power within the nation.
[03:17:27.835 --> 03:17:31.837]  The people who go to the meeting, there's only like two or three people from each country.
[03:17:31.837 --> 03:17:33.358]  They go back to their country and say,
[03:17:33.638 --> 03:17:35.639]  Hey, I heard this at the Bilderberg meeting.
[03:17:35.639 --> 03:17:36.719]  What do you think?
[03:17:36.719 --> 03:17:41.981]  And the National Assembly or the powerful people say, I think it's a lot of malarkey.
[03:17:41.981 --> 03:17:44.081]  Take it back and shove it someplace.
[03:17:44.081 --> 03:17:51.524]  So this idea that this is a plot that is carried out to 30 or 40 countries and implemented is baloney.
[03:17:52.745 --> 03:17:55.328]  How can you be so sure about what you're saying here?
[03:17:55.328 --> 03:18:02.676]  Because it's such a secretive organisation, such a secretive group indeed, how can you be so sure about that?
[03:18:02.676 --> 03:18:04.899]  And if it has no influence, what's the point of it all?
[03:18:08.251 --> 03:18:17.997]  Well, of course these people have influence and they want to talk about how to expand their power and we should object to the way powerful and rich people manipulate the world economy to their benefit.
[03:18:17.997 --> 03:18:19.438]  I have no problem with that.
[03:18:19.438 --> 03:18:20.839]  But how am I so sure?
[03:18:20.839 --> 03:18:33.306]  These same allocations were made in the late 1790s against the Illuminati, then the Freemasons, then the Jesuits, then the Jewish bankers in the Protocols of the Elders of Zion from Russia.
[03:18:33.306 --> 03:18:36.769]  An apocalyptic conspiracy theory about Jewish bankers.
[03:18:36.769 --> 03:18:37.269]  Then it was the
[03:18:37.469 --> 03:18:37.629]  I think?
[03:19:07.589 --> 03:19:09.470]  Good to have you on the programme tonight.
[03:19:09.470 --> 03:19:11.011]  Chip Burleigh, investigative journalist.
[03:19:11.011 --> 03:19:15.092]  Thanks for being on RT.
[03:19:15.092 --> 03:19:32.800]  Now that was Chip Burleigh, who works for a group called the Political Research Associates, which is funded, if you go to Sourcewatch and check out who bankrolls this organisation that pays his way, by, you guessed it, the Ford Foundation.
[03:19:33.939 --> 03:19:47.211]  Now the Ford Foundation, as we'll explain after the break, is expert in bankrolling these attacks on so-called conspiracy theories, and will analyse the propaganda that you just heard after this break.
[03:20:02.481 --> 03:20:05.505]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:20:05.505 --> 03:20:10.831]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:20:10.831 --> 03:20:12.873]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:20:12.873 --> 03:20:17.398]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:20:17.418 --> 03:20:17.678]  I think?
[03:20:37.159 --> 03:20:40.883]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:20:40.883 --> 03:20:42.104]  How much will you need?
[03:20:42.104 --> 03:20:43.005]  We don't know.
[03:20:43.005 --> 03:20:44.106]  How much do you want?
[03:20:44.106 --> 03:20:45.047]  All you can get.
[03:20:45.047 --> 03:20:46.128]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:20:46.128 --> 03:20:49.191]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[03:22:01.775 --> 03:22:05.899]  You may be arrested and or subject to public police action.
[03:22:05.899 --> 03:22:07.160]  Tyranny is here.
[03:22:07.160 --> 03:22:10.844]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:22:10.844 --> 03:22:13.326]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:22:13.326 --> 03:22:19.192]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.

[03:23:53.131 --> 03:24:05.521]  As we've been driving down the Wines Way, for much too long streaming,
[03:24:14.790 --> 03:24:22.014]  It's the Alex Jones Show, with me, Paul Joseph Watson, sitting in for Alex for this final segment.
[03:24:22.014 --> 03:24:28.478]  And you just heard an interview with Chip Belay on Russia Today.
[03:24:28.478 --> 03:24:35.702]  Now, Chip Belay is somebody who makes a career out of, quote, debunking conspiracy theories.
[03:24:35.702 --> 03:24:39.484]  He works for a group called the Political Research Associates,
[03:24:39.844 --> 03:25:00.663]  Who, just by coincidence, are funded by the Ford Foundation, which is an attack dog which transnational elitists use on a regular basis to demonize any criticism of their agenda for a global government as extremist and anti-semitic, which is
[03:25:01.283 --> 03:25:12.029]  A little bit rich given the history of Henry Ford and the Ford Foundation with funding the Nazi war machine and Hitler giving awards to Henry Ford.
[03:25:12.029 --> 03:25:24.896]  And now the Ford Foundation is attacking people like Alex Jones and Prison Planet for saying that the Bilderberg Group has any power over world events as an anti-semitic conspiracy theory.
[03:25:24.896 --> 03:25:27.758]  A little bit rich there from Chip Belay.
[03:25:27.758 --> 03:25:29.879]  But he said in the Russia Today interview that
[03:25:30.945 --> 03:25:48.429]  Anyone who believes Bildberg has any influence over world affairs and is working towards a new world order is, quote, a lot of malarkey and a hoax carried out by people who believe in an elaborate fairy tale about how power is executed in the world.
[03:25:48.929 --> 03:26:02.618]  Well, I'm afraid Mr. Chip Belay and also Ian Hollingshead of the London Telegraph, who authored an article a couple of days ago, basically dismissing any notion that Bilderberg has power.
[03:26:04.119 --> 03:26:24.593]  Those two individuals are going to have to get out a very big plate, put their words on it and start eating because the big breaking Bilderberg news today is going to go up on Prison Planet in the next break and its former NATO Secretary General admits Bilderberg sets global policy
[03:26:25.293 --> 03:26:41.382]  And this is Willy Klass, a two-time Bilderberg attendee, who told a Belgian radio station that each Bilderberg member gives a ten-minute presentation, after which a report of that presentation is formalized by Bilderberg organizers.
[03:26:41.382 --> 03:26:51.989]  And then Bilderberg members in each individual country are mandated to implement that policy, that consensus, on a global scale.
[03:26:52.589 --> 03:27:05.479]  So the fact that Bilderberg does set policy at its annual secret meetings has now been admitted by no less than an actual Bilderberg member.
[03:27:05.479 --> 03:27:14.826]  Now in the clip you just heard Belay contradicts himself several times but he basically tries to make out that
[03:27:16.479 --> 03:27:34.885]  Builderberg members take what they've heard from Bilderberg, then go back to their host countries, and even if they raise the issues that were discussed at Bilderberg, quote, more powerful people then tell them to go and shove it, and that's a direct quote from Chipotle.
[03:27:35.825 --> 03:27:48.955]  Now that's quite interesting because the Prime Minister of Spain, his Secretary General and the Queen of Spain attended this past weekend's meeting in Sitges just outside Barcelona.
[03:27:48.955 --> 03:27:51.317]  So, if according to Chip Berlay that
[03:27:51.857 --> 03:27:52.077]  You think?
[03:28:11.690 --> 03:28:25.695]  In reality, Belay knows that the most powerful people in the world do attend Bilderberg, and that it is at Bilderberg where that consensus for how global events are going to unfold over the next 12 months is agreed upon.
[03:28:25.695 --> 03:28:32.617]  And that's now being admitted by former NATO Secretary General Willy Klaas, a two-time Bilderberg attendee.
[03:28:33.834 --> 03:28:43.639]  Now, merely on the face of it, the claim that Bilderberg does not have an influence on policy is patently ridiculous.
[03:28:43.639 --> 03:28:52.944]  I make the comparison of if you had 200 MLB officials attending a secret meeting for four days in America.
[03:28:55.029 --> 03:29:03.491]  Would this have an impact on the future of baseball if 200 Major League Baseball officials attended a secret meeting and talked about baseball?
[03:29:03.491 --> 03:29:04.891]  I wonder.
[03:29:04.891 --> 03:29:22.315]  But that's essentially what Berlay and Ian Holling said of the London Telegraph are trying to convince us of, that top CEOs like Bill Gates of Microsoft and Eric Schmidt of Google, top bankers like Marcus Agius of Barclays and Peter Sutherland of Goldman Sachs,
[03:29:22.935 --> 03:29:43.622]  Don't meet with national presidents, prime ministers, big newspaper owners, members of the European Parliament, and members of the US government to talk about anything important, that they just get together for four days to talk about tiddlywinks, which is on the face of it completely absurd, and we'll continue to explore this after the break of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:29:51.986 --> 03:29:55.908]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.908 --> 03:30:01.291]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.291 --> 03:30:05.513]  You may be arrested and you're subject to other police action.
[03:30:05.513 --> 03:30:06.774]  Tyranny is here.
[03:30:06.774 --> 03:30:10.656]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:30:10.656 --> 03:30:12.957]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:30:12.957 --> 03:30:18.360]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:30:18.800 --> 03:30:25.468]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[03:30:25.468 --> 03:30:31.455]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:30:31.455 --> 03:30:35.139]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[03:30:35.619 --> 03:30:39.903]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.

[03:32:01.567 --> 03:32:02.248]  Question.
[03:32:02.248 --> 03:32:08.452]  If you have a septic system, did you know that proper maintenance can save you thousands of dollars in costly and unnecessary repairs?

[03:33:04.808 --> 03:33:11.453]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:33:11.453 --> 03:33:14.415]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:33:19.256 --> 03:33:25.341]  This is Paul Joseph Watson sitting in for Alex Jones while he works on his upcoming documentary film.
[03:33:25.341 --> 03:33:41.434]  Now before the break we were talking about the debunkers who have been out in force over the past few days trying to portray Bilderberg as this group of irrelevant old men that have no influence over global policy.
[03:33:42.074 --> 03:33:59.181]  And we played a clip from Russia Today with the Ford Foundation operative Chip Boulay saying that anyone who claims Bilderberg has any power over modern contemporary events believes in a fairy tale and is also probably a closet racist.
[03:34:00.074 --> 03:34:29.634]  Now, this completely contradicts the latest news that's going to go up on PrisonPlanet.com shortly, with this top NATO Secretary General and two-time Bilderberg attendee, Willy Klaas, former Minister for Belgium, who said that indeed Bilderberg do set global policy, that each member gives a speech for 10 minutes, a report of that speech is compiled, and then each Bilderberg member is mandated to enact those policies in terms of
[03:34:30.214 --> 03:34:37.940]  War, the environment, oil prices, global government in their own host countries.
[03:34:37.940 --> 03:34:54.652]  Now, people like Boullée and Ian Hollingshead of the Telegraph use bluff and slimy semantics to imply that just because no treaties or laws are signed and sealed at Bilderberg that the group itself has no power.
[03:34:55.973 --> 03:35:20.667]  But the fact that Bilderberg does set the agenda, sets the global consensus, from a whole gamut of policy areas, as I said, from oil to the environment to the economy, is not only being confirmed by Willy Klaas, as I just mentioned, but in March of last year, no less than Etienne d'Avignon, the chairman of the Bilderberg Group,
[03:35:21.790 --> 03:35:43.849]  said in an interview with the EU Observer, now in a separate interview he told the BBC that we have no power over global events, we don't set policy, but he was caught out in an interview with the EU Observer in which he said that the Bilderberg Group quote helped create the euro in the 1990s.
[03:35:46.007 --> 03:36:09.401]  Now we know that the foundation for the EU and ultimately the euro single currency were initially laid out by Bilderberg in the mid-fifties and Wikileaks got the documents and these were also acquired by the BBC from the 1955 meeting, the Bilderberg meeting which took place in West Germany, in which
[03:36:10.942 --> 03:36:17.653]  Builderberg members talk about the agenda for a European Common Market and a single European currency.
[03:36:17.653 --> 03:36:18.895]  Now bear in mind that...
[03:36:20.151 --> 03:36:30.501]  The Euro itself was not even discussed by the European Union until 1992 with the Maastricht Treaty.
[03:36:30.501 --> 03:36:43.853]  So, debunkers could claim that, you know, the idea of a continental European system of trade was floating around in the mid-50s, which it was, but to claim that the Bilderberg Group
[03:36:44.794 --> 03:36:53.601]  Um, simply by means of it being a contemporary political idea, uh, in the 50s, uh, decided to pursue the euro is completely...
[03:36:54.867 --> 03:37:10.540]  Incorrect, because the Euro did not start being included in policy debates until the early 90s, the 1992 Maastricht Treaty, and then it was only implemented about eight years later.
[03:37:10.540 --> 03:37:17.546]  So, we've got NATO Secretary Generals, we've got the very chairman of the Bilderberg Group, Etienne Davignon, saying that
[03:37:18.106 --> 03:37:34.831]  We do craft policy, we do send our members back to their nation states and they create major areas of continental unions like the European Union and like the euro single currency itself.
[03:37:34.831 --> 03:37:42.353]  Now these 1955 documents detail explicit plans to
[03:37:44.192 --> 03:38:04.242]  create not only a euro single currency, they also detail the fact that it could only be created after the central political authority of the European Union is in place, which is what happened with the Treaty of Rome which was signed in 1957.
[03:38:04.242 --> 03:38:10.665]  So Bilderberg made it clear in their own documents, and this was a year after Bilderberg was founded,
[03:38:11.665 --> 03:38:18.173]  in 1955 that they wanted a European Union and on top of that they wanted a euro single currency.
[03:38:18.173 --> 03:38:21.176]  That's Bilderberg creating policy.
[03:38:21.176 --> 03:38:25.481]  That's Bilderberg having a direct influence over world events.
[03:38:25.481 --> 03:38:26.042]  And of course
[03:38:27.310 --> 03:38:47.417]  It's not only with Europe that Bildberg have had a major input and a major impact on crafting policy that we see unfold in the short term over the next 12 months, which is what routinely happens, and then a decades-long agenda, which is how the European Union and the EU unfolded.
[03:38:49.341 --> 03:39:05.829]  In 2002 Bilderberg meeting which took place in France, you'll remember at the time that the invasion of Iraq was basically a certainty and that everybody thought that the attack would take place that summer in 2002.
[03:39:08.567 --> 03:39:27.180]  Jim Tucker got his sources in the 2002 Bilderberg meeting to leak the information that Bilderberg had expressed their desire for the attack on Iran to be delayed until March of the following year, 2003, which is exactly what happened.
[03:39:27.180 --> 03:39:33.025]  Another example of Bilderberg setting the policy and then it playing out in the real world within 12 months.
[03:39:35.546 --> 03:39:44.075]  In addition, 2006 Bilderberg meeting, which is the one that Alex Jones attended in Ottawa, Canada.
[03:39:45.609 --> 03:39:56.434]  We got it from our sources within Bilderberg that the US housing market would be allowed to inflate into a bubble before it was cruelly popped.
[03:39:56.434 --> 03:40:03.737]  And that's exactly what transpired in the 18 months after that meeting in 2006.
[03:40:03.737 --> 03:40:08.499]  Likewise, 2008 Bilderberg meeting in Chantilly, Virginia.
[03:40:09.738 --> 03:40:25.325]  We learned that Bilderberg was setting the stage for a financial calamity, that they were preparing for a major economic collapse and we reported it at the time at prisonplanet.com and you can go back in the archives and see those reports.
[03:40:25.325 --> 03:40:36.871]  And they said that basically there was going to be a worldwide financial implosion and the elitists took this as a message to reposition their assets, get out of the market,
[03:40:37.947 --> 03:41:04.555]  Lo and behold, a few months later, in 2008, September, Lehman Brothers collapsed and it marks the beginning of the economic recession, which is now threatening to double dip and turn into an economic depression with the collapse of the Euro, which is obviously what Bilderberg have been talking about at their meeting just outside Barcelona.
[03:41:04.555 --> 03:41:04.695]  Now,
[03:41:05.891 --> 03:41:32.657]  Not only do Bildberg have a direct input on crafting the policy of the nation states that the members represent, but they habitually flex their muscles in selecting not only Prime Ministers and Presidents, obviously Bill Clinton and Tony Blair are two of the primary examples of that, but also even down to the level of running mates.
[03:41:34.404 --> 03:41:49.475]  Barack Obama's running mate, and obviously now the Vice President, Joe Beden, was selected by Bilderberg luminary James A. Johnson shortly before Obama took office.
[03:41:49.475 --> 03:41:56.901]  Likewise, John Kerry, at the time when John Kerry was about to announce
[03:41:58.117 --> 03:42:00.601]  That he was running for president in 2004.
[03:42:00.601 --> 03:42:04.807]  Of course, that was a staged skull and bones election between Kerry and Bush.
[03:42:06.678 --> 03:42:31.366]  It was widely expected that Dick Gephardt would secure the position of Kerry's running mate and indeed the New York Post reported at the time that Dick Gephardt had been chosen to be Kerry's number two and that stickers were being placed on the campaign vehicles for John Kerry right up until the last minute.
[03:42:32.315 --> 03:42:47.718]  Which is when the 2004 Bilderberg Conference took place in Stresa, Italy, at which John Edwards gave a glowing speech about global government and how we need a new world order.
[03:42:47.718 --> 03:43:01.520]  And the Bilderberg members even broke house rules to rise to their feet and applaud Kerry for this big speech on how we all need to centralise the world into an authoritarian global government.
[03:43:02.461 --> 03:43:17.886]  As a result of that, despite the fact that the stickers were already being placed on the campaign vehicles for Kerry Gephardt, it was subsequently announced and United Press International reported on this.
[03:43:17.886 --> 03:43:23.908]  They said that Edwards was the surprise choice and that his selection
[03:43:24.946 --> 03:43:29.930]  It was solely down to the fact that he gave this glowing speech at Bilderberg.
[03:43:29.930 --> 03:43:46.463]  So again, another example of how Bilderberg acts in a kingmaker capacity and directly selects not only presidential candidates but even their running mates, which is what happened in 2004 with John Kerry.
[03:43:46.463 --> 03:43:52.648]  Again, completely contradicts the notion that people who believe Bilderberg have power believe in fairy tales.
[03:43:53.646 --> 03:44:01.153]  Complete bunker, as we've seen from Chip Belay and Ian Hollingshead of the Telegraph.
[03:44:01.153 --> 03:44:09.882]  2008, Pedro Santana Lopez and José Socrates, Portuguese ministers, attended
[03:44:11.799 --> 03:44:13.921]  The 2004 meeting also in Italy.
[03:44:13.921 --> 03:44:18.424]  It was reported on in 2008 by a Portuguese newspaper.
[03:44:18.424 --> 03:44:24.509]  Both of them went on to become Prime Minister of Portugal.
[03:44:24.509 --> 03:44:28.953]  Both after attending a meeting at Bilderberg.
[03:44:28.953 --> 03:44:35.618]  Now that's not to say that everybody in political office who attends Bilderberg is going to go on and become Prime Minister.
[03:44:35.618 --> 03:44:38.020]  They have to acquiesce.
[03:44:38.020 --> 03:44:39.160]  They have to appease
[03:44:40.236 --> 03:44:54.981]  What globalists, what the Bilderberg Steering Committee, Rockefeller, Brzezinski, Davignon, they have to like what they hear from these potential Prime Ministers and Presidents if they are to be selected.
[03:44:54.981 --> 03:45:06.185]  Rick Perry attended a Bilderberg meeting several years ago and he came away from it saying that, you know, basically it was a waste of time.
[03:45:06.185 --> 03:45:07.926]  And obviously whatever Perry said
[03:45:09.074 --> 03:45:09.495]  I don't
[03:45:28.894 --> 03:45:36.499]  These candidates often go on to be selected for political office, not elected by the people.
[03:45:36.499 --> 03:45:55.533]  Another example of how Bilderberg is anti-democratic and authoritarian and does set policy as has now been admitted by a Bilderberg member and former NATO Secretary General Willy Klaas along with Etienne D'Avignon who said that Bilderberg created the euro.
[03:45:59.269 --> 03:46:09.583]  Not only is it in selecting political candidates and steering the economic policy of the globe that Bilderberg has its hand in the cookie jar, so to speak.
[03:46:09.583 --> 03:46:11.565]  A classic example is oil prices.
[03:46:13.663 --> 03:46:26.334]  Before oil went up to $150 a barrel, which occurred in 2008, bear in mind that a few years previously it was down at $30 odd a barrel.
[03:46:26.334 --> 03:46:39.626]  In 2008 it went up to $150, which is exactly what Kissinger and Rockefeller and the Bilderberg members called for during the 2005 Bilderberg meeting which took place in Germany.
[03:46:40.186 --> 03:46:46.113]  So, they called for oil prices to be accelerated rapidly, which is exactly what happened in 2008.
[03:46:46.113 --> 03:46:55.102]  And then, after 2008, Bildberg called for oil prices to be depressed once again.
[03:46:56.471 --> 03:46:56.551]  I'm
[03:47:16.781 --> 03:47:33.013]  dramatically to $150 a barrel and Williams then later appeared on the Alex Jones Show and predicted the oil was set to fall back down to the $50 a barrel level which it did in 2009.
[03:47:33.013 --> 03:47:43.540]  So again another solid concrete example of Bilderberg calling for a policy to be enacted by
[03:47:44.622 --> 03:47:56.391]  The members that attend, bear in mind that routinely the CEOs of major oil companies, BP, Dutch Royal Shell, attend Bilderberg meetings.
[03:47:56.391 --> 03:48:00.134]  Every year Dutch Royal Shell is represented at Bilderberg.
[03:48:00.134 --> 03:48:03.957]  They control the capacity at which oil is refined.
[03:48:04.867 --> 03:48:14.855]  So they can create artificial scarcity when they want oil prices to go up, and they can create an abundance of oil when they want oil prices to go down.
[03:48:14.855 --> 03:48:23.182]  Of course, also it's impacted by what the dollar's doing in certain economic conditions, but primarily
[03:48:25.185 --> 03:48:28.927]  They followed the orders of their Bilderberg masters.
[03:48:28.927 --> 03:48:37.073]  Kissinger wanted the oil prices up, they went up, Kissinger wanted them back down again a couple of years later and they went down.
[03:48:37.073 --> 03:48:53.203]  So again another concrete example of Bilderberg formulating the policy, communicating it to the invitees who attend the conference and then within 12 months it plays out in the real world.
[03:48:54.221 --> 03:49:07.330]  Another example of how Bilderberg does have power and its members do exercise it aggressively in their host nations.
[03:49:07.330 --> 03:49:20.280]  Now of course, with regard to Iran, Bilderberg all along has been sceptical of an attack on Iran.
[03:49:20.280 --> 03:49:20.420]  In 2008,
[03:49:22.659 --> 03:49:41.836]  They said that it wasn't the right time to launch military airstrikes on the country and this kind of dovish theme has followed in Bilderberg meetings throughout history because they're mainly dominated by the European socialist contingent who prefer to get their will government by
[03:49:44.167 --> 03:49:47.968]  Little steps rather than massive advances.
[03:49:47.968 --> 03:50:02.331]  But for the first time in 2010, according to Jim Tucker and his sources from inside Bilderberg, they now overwhelmingly support an attack on Iran in 2010.
[03:50:02.331 --> 03:50:13.773]  So, I mean, we're at the most significant danger of that happening now over the last 12 months because history has shown us that if Bilderberg call for something, they usually get it.
[03:50:15.219 --> 03:50:21.950]  And it's happened with many different policy areas before, and one can only hope that it doesn't happen again.
[03:50:21.950 --> 03:50:27.019]  But, according to Tucker, now the majority of Bilderberg members want the attack on Iran.
[03:50:27.019 --> 03:50:28.541]  So, you know, watch out.
[03:50:30.472 --> 03:50:50.344]  But, as we can see from what I've just documented in the list that I've just provided of concrete examples of Bilderberg having a direct impact on global policy, people like Vallée and Hollingshead have been proven completely wrong in their claims that Bilderberg has no influence whatsoever.
[03:50:50.344 --> 03:50:52.165]  So, we've got a lot of explaining to do.
[03:51:02.594 --> 03:51:04.476]  Don't answer it!

[03:52:01.547 --> 03:52:06.531]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[03:52:06.531 --> 03:52:07.512]  What have we got?
[03:52:07.512 --> 03:52:09.974]  A republic or a monarchy?
[03:52:09.974 --> 03:52:10.974]  A republic.
[03:52:10.974 --> 03:52:13.616]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[03:52:13.616 --> 03:52:15.898]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[03:52:15.898 --> 03:52:17.920]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[03:52:17.920 --> 03:52:19.601]  So they think they own our land?
[03:52:19.601 --> 03:52:20.922]  They think they own our water?
[03:52:20.922 --> 03:52:21.523]  Children?
[03:52:21.523 --> 03:52:22.643]  Our education?
[03:52:22.643 --> 03:52:23.484]  Our money?
[03:52:23.484 --> 03:52:27.127]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[03:52:27.481 --> 03:52:31.184]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[03:52:31.184 --> 03:52:32.465]  You're being warned.
[03:52:32.465 --> 03:52:33.485]  We have the facts.
[03:52:33.485 --> 03:52:34.646]  We have the Constitution.
[03:52:34.646 --> 03:52:35.547]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[03:52:35.547 --> 03:52:36.427]  We have common law.
[03:52:36.427 --> 03:52:38.689]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.

[03:54:10.310 --> 03:54:16.154]  Global elite are in crisis.
[03:54:16.154 --> 03:54:18.356]  They're furious at being exposed.
[03:54:18.356 --> 03:54:31.465]  They want Americans disarmed, destitute and disengaged from caring about who is really running their lives in a completely illegal and undemocratic manner from behind closed doors.
[03:54:32.446 --> 03:54:38.151]  Now, Bilderberg and the march towards world government is an open conspiracy.
[03:54:38.151 --> 03:54:41.433]  It cannot continue in a veiled form.
[03:54:41.433 --> 03:54:44.055]  They have to put it out there in the open.
[03:54:44.055 --> 03:54:50.761]  But in doing so, they run the risk of the resistance to the agenda growing in leaps and bounds.
[03:54:51.881 --> 03:55:07.391]  On a regular basis, which is exactly what's happening with the Bilderberg group, who are experiencing protests in growing numbers year by year, increasing media attention year by year, and they're upset about it.
[03:55:07.391 --> 03:55:08.712]  They're furious.
[03:55:08.712 --> 03:55:17.258]  We had the conversation overheard by the London Guardian journalist Charlie Skelton, who said that Bilderberg organises
[03:55:18.168 --> 03:55:43.859]  were incensed at the fact that they were bullhorned in 2006 by Alex Jones and that protesters still have an income, that's a direct quote, an income that enables them to travel to Bilderberg meetings on a yearly basis to protest the dirty deeds being done behind closed doors by these globalists who their own
[03:55:44.810 --> 03:55:48.891]  Bilderberg members now admit, set policy.
[03:55:48.891 --> 03:55:52.873]  Bilderberg sets policy, it's admitted, it's no longer up for debate.
[03:55:52.873 --> 03:55:56.874]  Etienne Davignon admitted that Bilderberg created the euro.
[03:55:56.874 --> 03:56:07.198]  Now, NATO Secretary General, former NATO Secretary General, Willy Klaas, two-time Bilderberg member, former Foreign Affairs Minister for Belgium, admits
[03:56:08.038 --> 03:56:12.859]  On a Belgian radio station, Bilderberg does set policy.
[03:56:12.859 --> 03:56:25.242]  They mandate their members to follow a report that's compiled from each member's presentation and then, to the best of their ability, set it as policy in each of their nations.
[03:56:25.242 --> 03:56:28.103]  So there's no debate on it anymore.
[03:56:28.103 --> 03:56:32.184]  Chip Boulay, Ian Hollingstead, all these debunkers who have attempted to claim that
[03:56:32.904 --> 03:56:42.150]  People who think that powerful people might get together and scheme in an anti-democratic way to increase their power are looney tunes.
[03:56:42.150 --> 03:56:46.733]  Well, that's completely been proven inaccurate.
[03:56:46.733 --> 03:56:53.437]  And these people have a lot of explaining to do because you can no longer excuse them by using ignorance.
[03:56:53.437 --> 03:56:55.179]  I mean, this stuff's out in the open.
[03:56:56.300 --> 03:57:10.118]  Either they're really shoddy researchers or they're being paid to lie by the organisations that fund them, like the Ford Foundation that funds the group that Chip Belay works for.
[03:57:11.843 --> 03:57:15.044]  So we know Bilderberg now is an open conspiracy.
[03:57:15.044 --> 03:57:19.305]  We know that their agenda is a post-industrial revolution.
[03:57:19.305 --> 03:57:22.306]  They want higher unemployment, high taxes.
[03:57:22.306 --> 03:57:33.990]  They want to implement fascist austerity measures which are coming to the United States within seven years according to the latest GDP to National Debt Ratio reports which show that
[03:57:34.710 --> 03:57:43.118]  The USA is going to be in exactly the same situation as Greece in roughly seven years.
[03:57:43.118 --> 03:57:49.223]  So will we see the kind of riots on the streets that we saw in Greece and continue to happen around the world?
[03:57:49.223 --> 03:57:52.326]  A lot of people are predicting that we will see that.
[03:57:52.326 --> 03:57:53.007]  Don't forget that
[03:57:55.191 --> 03:58:00.734]  In the 70s in the United Kingdom, tax was at 98% for people earning over 20,000.
[03:58:00.734 --> 03:58:13.282]  So, there's going to be a lot of strife to come, and it just remains to be seen how far they will push this fascist austerity agenda, and how the American people will react.
[03:58:14.102 --> 03:58:16.604]  Sure, the globalists are in crisis.
[03:58:16.604 --> 03:58:20.486]  The American people are rising in revolt against it.
[03:58:20.486 --> 03:58:25.969]  And that, as Alex Jones said in his video the other day, has the globalists running scared.
[03:58:25.969 --> 03:58:35.994]  And patriots should be popping champagne corks in recognition of what we've achieved and the long march to freedom in the future.
