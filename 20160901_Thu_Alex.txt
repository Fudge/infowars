[00:00.000 --> 00:14.800]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[00:14.800 --> 00:34.720]  I want to be a trillion percent clear the globalist have launched their great offensive
[00:34.720 --> 00:43.840]  everything is going to accelerate from this point and we've run out of time these
[00:43.840 --> 00:51.360]  are not probes they're not testing anymore they're dropping the hammer the
[00:51.360 --> 01:01.840]  hammer has already fallen the sparks are beginning to fly as they attempt to
[01:01.840 --> 01:08.360]  beat the once free republics of the west into a weapon system carry out the
[01:08.360 --> 01:20.120]  extermination of the majority of this planet's population and it hit me this
[01:20.120 --> 01:35.000]  morning I have never been more shaken isn't the word more gripped by the
[01:35.000 --> 01:50.840]  understanding and the sorrow and the grief that my fellow countrymen my fellow
[01:50.840 --> 01:56.480]  humans have willfully turned themselves over
[01:56.480 --> 02:06.080]  spiritually culturally metaphysically to the apparatus of tyranny the common
[02:06.080 --> 02:15.360]  sense to stand against it the shreds of honor he's all we need to stop this but
[02:15.360 --> 02:23.280]  the lapdog nature the cowardly nature of the corporate henchmen that pose as
[02:23.280 --> 02:30.200]  reporters that pose as journalists is going to deliver us into a nightmare
[02:30.200 --> 02:37.320]  scenario and we're already in a nightmare scenario but it is going to
[02:37.320 --> 02:43.520]  absolutely spiral out of control now and you can even see the rotting evil
[02:43.520 --> 02:49.040]  globalists that are running it falling apart in front of our very eyes as they
[02:49.040 --> 02:57.720]  stoke the flames of the funeral pyre that is meant to disintegrate humanity
[02:57.720 --> 03:04.440]  these people are committed to evil and then I look at the news and I look at
[03:04.440 --> 03:11.560]  what's happening and I juxtapose it to Donald Trump going to Mexico and saying
[03:11.560 --> 03:15.200]  let's fight globalism and the New World Order together that have been looting our
[03:15.200 --> 03:18.800]  nations let's work together it isn't the Donald Trump listens to what I have to
[03:18.800 --> 03:24.120]  say it isn't the Donald Trump's synced with Alex Jones he is synced to the
[03:24.120 --> 03:31.600]  spirit of resistance we're tuned into the same historical understanding I said
[03:31.600 --> 03:35.360]  on air yesterday no one knows who's gonna say in Mexico I said I would say
[03:35.360 --> 03:42.160]  let's battle globalism together and that's what he did
[03:42.160 --> 03:51.120]  unbelievable and you could just see God giving us this last chance with Donald
[03:51.120 --> 04:02.200]  Trump undoubtedly Donald Trump has been heaven sent and that's why the system is
[04:02.200 --> 04:05.920]  frothing in fear
[04:05.920 --> 04:13.120]  so for all the bad things that are happening a lot of good is happening as
[04:13.120 --> 04:30.160]  well and all I can tell you is our worst analysis of the globalist plan was it as
[04:30.160 --> 04:35.920]  bad as it actually is and I'm telling the media and everybody else that sold
[04:35.920 --> 04:41.560]  off the system you people are out of your minds where is your discernment
[04:41.560 --> 04:47.280]  your gut I mean you think you're gonna ally with this and you're gonna be
[04:47.280 --> 04:49.720]  winners
[04:49.720 --> 05:01.160]  oh my god this is the greatest evil the planet has ever faced Virginia state
[05:01.160 --> 05:05.160]  officials in Richmond say that there are now 40 confirmed cases of hepatitis A
[05:05.160 --> 05:09.400]  that are connected to strawberries used at tropical smoothie locations across the
[05:09.400 --> 05:13.680]  state these berries were imported from Egypt and they contain the hep A virus
[05:13.680 --> 05:17.360]  and they say that other states are affected as well officials encourage
[05:17.360 --> 05:20.720]  anyone who consumed a smoothie with frozen strawberries at a restaurant
[05:20.720 --> 05:24.840]  within the last 50 days to watch for symptoms of hepatitis A now this news
[05:24.840 --> 05:28.680]  comes as president Obama is planning on ramming through the passage of the TPP
[05:28.680 --> 05:32.600]  in coming days the TPP that would irrevocably compromise the safety of
[05:32.600 --> 05:36.240]  our food supply here in the US and immediately open up the floodgates of
[05:36.240 --> 05:40.520]  seafood poultry dairy fruit and vegetable imports to the country while we
[05:40.520 --> 05:45.760]  currently inspect only 2% of all food imports the TPP would also allow foreign
[05:45.760 --> 05:50.200]  companies to compromise food safety decisions and force us inspectors to
[05:50.200 --> 05:53.960]  make new assessments very quickly there are no resources or even a basic
[05:53.960 --> 05:57.640]  agreement in place to make sure that our food supply is safe I'm Margaret

[07:10.440 --> 07:14.920]  try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my
[07:14.920 --> 07:19.960]  system but right now we're dealing with massive parasites which is anything
[07:19.960 --> 07:24.280]  that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all
[07:24.280 --> 07:29.400]  the refugees spreading disease around we have biological warfare going on
[07:29.400 --> 07:32.720]  everywhere these are all parasites tell us about all the stuff I said there's so
[07:32.720 --> 07:35.880]  many things that are in it you have the name in there you have the organic
[07:35.880 --> 07:40.520]  clove bud the organic wormwood I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at

[07:58.320 --> 08:13.880]  great product
[08:13.880 --> 08:20.280]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[08:20.280 --> 08:33.200]  hollywood Babylon this is Babylon make no mistake
[08:34.200 --> 08:41.680]  Babylon fall in one hour the whole system fall in one hour
[08:41.680 --> 08:51.280]  computers my friends that's some interesting science fiction from 2,000
[08:51.280 --> 08:58.880]  years ago or is it well we're living it one way or the other it's either real
[08:58.880 --> 09:04.840]  and prophecy or they've used it as a blueprint and that's really the
[09:04.840 --> 09:09.880]  deception of the elite they believe they're using it as a blueprint which is
[09:09.880 --> 09:15.000]  the biggest joke of all because even if you're using it as a blueprint you then
[09:15.000 --> 09:20.680]  make it reality because that's what humans do we build it we make it we're
[09:20.680 --> 09:27.120]  able to construct it if we can envision it and that's why the globalists tell
[09:27.120 --> 09:32.200]  us that we're a bad species and an ugly species and a stupid species and need to
[09:32.200 --> 09:38.200]  be brushed off the earth talking to us like they're not human because they're
[09:38.200 --> 09:43.120]  psychopaths and a lot of psychiatrists and experts that study real
[09:43.120 --> 09:48.280]  psychopaths will tell you they're not people and they don't see you as having
[09:48.280 --> 10:00.080]  any value they don't have the real human components like passion and love and
[10:00.080 --> 10:10.360]  honor all they want to do is control and hurt people
[10:11.920 --> 10:16.240]  look at drudgereport.com today if you're watching us on television you're on
[10:16.240 --> 10:19.840]  the radio obviously go to him in full wars.com or drudgereport.com you can
[10:19.840 --> 10:26.560]  see these articles Matt Lauer Clinton global member to moderate first
[10:26.560 --> 10:32.880]  presidential forum that's right he's a big part of their global initiative where
[10:32.880 --> 10:36.160]  people put money in there and then they launder it and take it right back out
[10:36.160 --> 10:44.560]  she keeps 96% one year 97 another year of the money for herself at least she's
[10:44.560 --> 10:49.960]  better than Bono. Bono gives 1.2% no Hillary gives 3 or 4% she's very
[10:49.960 --> 11:03.520]  gracious. Oh boy and now he's gonna moderate the debate
[11:05.280 --> 11:11.240]  you know I don't they don't want to make Trump a martyr but Trump had better
[11:11.240 --> 11:18.840]  better watch the food he's eating and obviously Trump knows that but he's hit
[11:18.840 --> 11:29.320]  me. They like to see a great man crawl. They want to bring down strong people and
[11:29.320 --> 11:38.920]  make them weak like they are. Poison's always the number one go-to and there
[11:38.920 --> 11:44.600]  are more high-tech forms of poison today electro-magnetic.
[11:44.600 --> 11:53.880]  Hmm just a thought continuing. Oh Facebook satellite burns on the pad
[11:56.520 --> 12:02.920]  but Facebook is a deep state organ so I'm sure it'll get a few more of those
[12:02.920 --> 12:09.400]  up real quick. SpaceX rocket explodes at Cape Canaveral Space Center blowing up
[12:09.400 --> 12:15.920]  Facebook's 150 million pound internet satellite. Let's stop right there. You
[12:15.920 --> 12:19.600]  know what's getting blown up right now? I'm gonna make this announcement
[12:19.600 --> 12:26.120]  unequivocally I'm sure of it. It hit me like a speed bullet freight train going
[12:26.120 --> 12:36.280]  downhill this morning. Hit me so hard that I was stunned for an hour or two. Ran
[12:36.280 --> 12:43.880]  over me. Like a thunderbolt. The main assault's on. Everything else has been a
[12:43.880 --> 12:47.000]  test. Everything else has been a beta test. Everything you've seen with the
[12:47.000 --> 12:52.360]  globalist studying cultures, societies, economies, getting everything rigged from
[12:52.360 --> 12:57.480]  the stock market to interest rates to currency rates. Admittedly all rigged now.
[12:57.480 --> 13:02.280]  They now have major newspapers, have computers writing news stories for them.
[13:02.280 --> 13:05.280]  I told people about that ten years ago the CIA developed it. Now it's
[13:05.280 --> 13:08.360]  ubiquitous.
[13:11.000 --> 13:17.200]  The ships are going to robot. The cars are going to robot. The trucks are going
[13:17.200 --> 13:19.640]  to robot.
[13:20.840 --> 13:30.240]  The technocracy is in place. The New World Order is now officially in 2016.
[13:30.240 --> 13:34.640]  That's what the Supreme Court Justice was telling Drudge. Get ready it's all gonna
[13:34.640 --> 13:43.040]  start next year. And it is. They're going from beta to 1.0. That means New
[13:43.040 --> 13:47.640]  World Order. This is it. We are in the New World Order. We have crossed the line
[13:47.640 --> 13:54.840]  as of right now. In fact, mark the date.
[13:54.840 --> 14:10.680]  9-1. September 1st, 2016. They've turned on the technocracy, the world
[14:10.680 --> 14:16.160]  government. And I've got all the articles in front of me where the internet
[14:16.160 --> 14:22.000]  censorship is exploding, where Germany is getting ready to collapse. They are
[14:22.000 --> 14:27.640]  rolling their whole thing out. They are censoring. When a guy saves a baby and
[14:27.640 --> 14:32.320]  is a hero, they blur the Trump office shirt on the news. I mean, they have
[14:32.320 --> 14:37.680]  armies of sycophant humans who are busily selling out their fellow humans
[14:37.680 --> 14:41.480]  thinking they're gonna get a slot at the table.
[14:41.480 --> 14:51.640]  Even though they're setting up automated algorithm AI systems to
[14:51.640 --> 15:01.040]  replace them, it'd be like if you were a chef that was cooking for cannibals and
[15:01.040 --> 15:09.680]  your food stock was, you know, a pin of 30 or 40 people and some of them were
[15:09.680 --> 15:14.600]  your family in there, but that's okay. And every day you knock somebody else on
[15:14.600 --> 15:19.920]  the head and then you bring them in and you cut them up and then you cook them
[15:19.920 --> 15:25.400]  and you serve them to your masters upstairs. You don't really get a look
[15:25.400 --> 15:29.800]  at. You just kind of send the plates on, you know, through a conveyor belt
[15:29.800 --> 15:34.000]  and something in there, eats them. And then finally one day, you know, you get
[15:34.000 --> 15:40.280]  a little teletype out. You're telling you, oh, we want you to train this
[15:40.280 --> 15:49.240]  individual to help us cook, to prepare the meat, to prepare the feast. And you
[15:49.240 --> 15:52.800]  say, well, I'm the chef. I don't need any help. Oh, just please train this new
[15:52.800 --> 15:55.880]  chef because we've been looking at you and we think you're fattened up now and
[15:55.880 --> 16:00.320]  it's time to eat you too. And you dumbasses are sitting there with a pin
[16:00.320 --> 16:04.800]  of your fellow humans that you're serving up and you don't understand your
[16:04.800 --> 16:08.720]  necks on the conveyor belt because you've been taught how to be a synthetic
[16:08.720 --> 16:13.920]  sociopath or psychopath. That's what all this TV and murder and the simulations
[16:13.920 --> 16:18.200]  and, you know, the shoot them up games and all of it and the degradation, the
[16:18.200 --> 16:25.600]  movies and the TV is just to get everybody ready to accept the implosion
[16:25.600 --> 16:33.720]  of the human condition. I'm really blown away by the social engineers and I mean
[16:33.720 --> 16:46.320]  they've got a really, really nasty, nasty, nasty comportment. They are the type
[16:46.320 --> 16:49.520]  of people that grab your kid out of the backyard and torture him for a month in
[16:49.520 --> 16:52.440]  a dungeon. I mean, that's what we're dealing with here. It's come out in
[16:52.440 --> 16:57.600]  Europe where the top politicians and leaders have like basements with
[16:57.600 --> 17:01.840]  codlers. They torture for months and rape and kill. I mean, you're like, what in
[17:01.840 --> 17:08.880]  the world are you? That's who runs things. And to them it's pretty to see breast
[17:08.880 --> 17:13.520]  cancer up a couple thousand percentage points. It's fun to see autism up tens of
[17:13.520 --> 17:19.240]  thousands of percentage points. It's fun to see the once great and mighty human
[17:19.240 --> 17:31.000]  condition brought in low and to see a stumbling around shuffling zombies. I just
[17:31.000 --> 17:43.400]  can't believe it. And where are the men? Where are the people standing up? And it's
[17:43.400 --> 17:51.080]  here. It's on. Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of articles a day from the
[17:51.080 --> 17:54.720]  establishment on how they're going to censor and how they are censoring and
[17:54.720 --> 17:58.200]  how glorious it is. And maybe we should start arresting people. We disagree with
[17:58.200 --> 18:03.600]  oh yeah, let's do it. Oh yeah, that sounds fun.
[18:03.600 --> 18:13.680]  And it's weird like the zombie trendies and stuff are in a haze and they've got
[18:13.680 --> 18:17.160]  this operating system of tyranny now and they're getting off on you and you see
[18:17.160 --> 18:23.280]  them hopping around. Like just feeling the evil and they're like oh this feels
[18:23.280 --> 18:28.640]  good. Other people know what's going on. They decide to punch out. They decide to
[18:28.640 --> 18:39.560]  clock out. They decide to try to escape. They can't handle it. I get it. Problem is
[18:39.560 --> 18:42.440]  there's no word to punch out to. We come back and I'm going to get more into the
[18:42.440 --> 18:46.320]  news. I'm going to play the amazingly historic and presidential speech of
[18:46.320 --> 18:51.560]  Donald J. Trump in Mexico. A very honorable speech. Just telling the
[18:51.560 --> 18:54.440]  Mexicans look, I can't come down here and do whatever I want. You have your
[18:54.440 --> 18:57.800]  sovereignty. We have ours. We're all being screwed over by the multinationals.
[18:57.800 --> 19:04.600]  Let's work together. Trump believes in humanity. Trump believes he can give you
[19:04.600 --> 19:08.320]  a sophisticated argument. Trump believes he can talk about the real players and
[19:08.320 --> 19:14.040]  what's really happening. Trump is betting on that because see the globalist
[19:14.040 --> 19:21.640]  feed disinfo and low-grade information out to dumb people down. The whole
[19:21.640 --> 19:28.320]  program is in the message. What's in the message isn't even that important. Only
[19:28.320 --> 19:32.320]  that it be twisted and screwed up and full of garbage so that we just become a
[19:32.320 --> 19:36.920]  bunch of mindless idiots. But instead Donald Trump believes people can
[19:36.920 --> 19:46.120]  actually understand what's going on and what's happening. That's coming up. The
[19:46.120 --> 19:49.880]  censorship news is over the top. They're going to bring, I told you they're going to do this,
[19:49.880 --> 19:52.160]  but they've announced it. I mean Zuckerberg's been studying it. They're
[19:52.160 --> 19:57.320]  announcing Google is Chinese style net censorship here in the US. It's been
[19:57.320 --> 20:02.600]  announced. It's now official. There is an affordable alternative to the high
[20:02.600 --> 20:05.960]  cost of health care that offers freedom from insurance while providing
[20:05.960 --> 20:10.600]  compliance with the Obamacare individual mandate. Imagine having access to quality
[20:10.600 --> 20:14.040]  affordable health care that allows you the freedom to choose your doctor and

[24:06.400 --> 24:26.800]  Johnny Cash bringing us in. I hurt myself today to see if I still feel. I focus on the
[24:26.800 --> 24:37.420]  thing. The only thing. Imagine being a solo psychopath. The needle tears the
[24:37.420 --> 24:44.080]  woman. And then think what a soulless creature. The old familiar thing. It wants to do. It
[24:44.080 --> 24:50.040]  wants to amass control. Try to kill it. And power. All the way. And it wants to torture.
[24:50.040 --> 25:03.240]  But I remember. And hold captive. Innocence. What have I become? Where we heat our hospitals
[25:03.240 --> 25:13.160]  with dead babies. Where we test the flavoring for soft drinks. Infant tissue. Where we splice
[25:13.160 --> 25:31.160]  our embryos with animals. And bring the abominations to turn. Grown inside humans and animals.
[25:31.160 --> 25:42.040]  And a world government. Where the cashless society control grid is only getting started.
[25:42.040 --> 25:53.440]  The crimes. Where like little waves on a pond compared to a tsunami.
[25:53.440 --> 25:58.640]  Hell itself will manifest on this planet if their program is allowed to be carried out.
[25:58.640 --> 26:11.720]  The Bible says if God didn't intervene, there would be no flesh left on the earth. No flesh.
[26:11.720 --> 26:24.000]  No flesh left. And now the technology is there to do exactly that. I want to get to all this
[26:24.000 --> 26:28.560]  news. It's such a heavy news day. So many incredibly important clubs. The most important
[26:28.560 --> 26:32.880]  ever. But I just want to let everybody know. The globalists tend to launch major operations.
[26:32.880 --> 26:37.800]  Give new world order speeches on September 1st. I just walked into the office and talked
[26:37.800 --> 26:42.200]  with some of the guys and I said a major jump in activity. The likes of which we've never
[26:42.200 --> 26:46.680]  seen the coordination. The globalists admitting they're launching a lot of new big initiatives.
[26:46.680 --> 26:54.120]  This is the global push. And it hit me that when we talk about them stealing the election.
[26:54.120 --> 26:58.800]  And we talk about the Justice Department Homeland Security saying it's going to come in and
[26:58.800 --> 27:09.120]  run the election now. But Donald Trump said for saying they would do that a month ago.
[27:09.120 --> 27:18.160]  You're like where's the logic net? It's a war on logic. These people are just totally
[27:18.160 --> 27:26.960]  turned over to lies. And it's one unified spectrum of deception, whether it's CNN or
[27:26.960 --> 27:34.520]  whether it's MSNBC or NPR and they just spew an entire false reality. And their minions
[27:34.520 --> 27:40.720]  go with it in lockstep and no one reports on the new emails pouring out daily. There's
[27:40.720 --> 27:49.200]  new ones that are on infowars.com where Nancy Pelosi admits that ISIS is al-Qaeda and it's
[27:49.200 --> 27:52.880]  U.S. policy to use them in the Middle East to take over countries. Now we already knew
[27:52.880 --> 27:58.760]  that. Cy Hersh has come out with that. And I just used that as a credibility point. We
[27:58.760 --> 28:07.640]  broke it. You broke it. You pushed it. Rudge. Put it out. It's true. It's like going into
[28:07.640 --> 28:12.800]  a bar and you know some guy's playing darts and puts all five darts right in the bullseye
[28:12.800 --> 28:17.760]  and you go that guy's a terrible dart player. Yeah, that'd be a satire joke, wouldn't it?
[28:17.760 --> 28:21.800]  But the public would believe it if they're in that zombified condition. Yes, you're
[28:21.800 --> 28:35.960]  a terrible dart player. Amazing. So looking at this, let me show you what's emblematic
[28:35.960 --> 28:42.440]  before I come back and get into all the censorship and then play Trump's speech. What's emblematic?
[28:42.440 --> 28:51.440]  Watch headline news who just fired Dr. Drew because he dared come out and say Hillary
[28:51.440 --> 28:59.840]  needs to be assessed. HLN blurs out Trump on man's t-shirt who saved baby from hot car
[28:59.840 --> 29:10.600]  when they rebroadcast it. Isn't that just special? That's what they're doing, ladies
[29:10.600 --> 29:24.360]  and gentlemen. And this story came out in October of 2015 and BBC and others pitched
[29:24.360 --> 29:29.880]  it like it was no big deal. Total control over the Internet, creating electronic ghettos
[29:29.880 --> 29:35.040]  where you can't even make money on the Internet or have a job in the physical third dimension.
[29:35.040 --> 29:40.480]  If you criticize the government of corporations, YouTube and Google are now announcing this
[29:40.480 --> 29:48.320]  system in the terms of service. It's happening. Zuckerberg has been coordinating with the
[29:48.320 --> 29:54.680]  Chinese Communist as well. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the
[29:54.680 --> 30:03.960]  GCN radio network. We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created
[30:03.960 --> 30:08.520]  equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among
[30:08.520 --> 30:13.600]  these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, that to secure these rights, governments
[30:13.600 --> 30:18.880]  are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, that
[30:18.880 --> 30:23.960]  whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people
[30:23.960 --> 30:31.360]  to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government. Independence isn't a day,
[30:31.360 --> 30:35.960]  it's a mindset, an attitude that says I will not be your dependent, I will not be your
[30:35.960 --> 30:42.920]  slave. Dependence and slavery is a chain that is forged link by link with gradual infringements.
[30:42.920 --> 30:48.240]  When you trade your liberty for safety, to that extent you become their slave. Slaves
[30:48.240 --> 30:54.960]  are never safe. You won't get rich by being a slave. Guard your liberty, regard with suspicion
[30:54.960 --> 30:56.960]  anyone who tries to take it.
[30:56.960 --> 31:09.520]  BrinfoWars.com, I'm David Dine.
[31:09.520 --> 31:13.800]  I've been working all day, I took a couple hours off coaching basketball, I get in here
[31:13.800 --> 31:17.920]  at 8.30, I was kind of run down, you know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make
[31:17.920 --> 31:21.560]  it and I really wanted to do a good job on the interview. I got my bottle of brain force
[31:21.560 --> 31:25.520]  right there, I popped two of them and about 20 minutes later it's like bing, everything
[31:25.520 --> 31:27.320]  just kind of clears up.
[31:27.320 --> 31:32.280]  Got four and a half stars, people really love it, read about it, find out why, third party
[31:32.280 --> 31:37.000]  nutraceutical sites give it such high praise because it really does have the best organic
[31:37.000 --> 31:39.920]  based systems that will blow your socks off.
[31:39.920 --> 31:42.880]  I haven't pulled an all nighter like that in a while but I probably could not have done
[31:42.880 --> 31:47.640]  it without brain force. I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep,
[31:47.640 --> 31:50.200]  got up, took two more brain force and came in.
[31:50.200 --> 31:58.960]  You will find brain force and other game changing products at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.

[33:23.400 --> 33:36.360]  And those are war drums folks. That's what this broadcast is all about, trying to get
[33:36.360 --> 33:41.640]  people out of their trance, get them out of the virtual reality for just long enough
[33:41.640 --> 33:47.680]  to see what's being woven around you and how many people in civilizations and countries
[33:47.680 --> 33:59.320]  have been sucked dry by these fighters. The innocent are crying out for protection. You
[33:59.320 --> 34:08.920]  can feel it. All right, let me plunge into the news now and get into the Trump speech
[34:08.920 --> 34:16.240]  and a lot more. Before I go any further, I'm not going to sit here and do a long pitch.
[34:16.240 --> 34:20.320]  I've just gotten to the point where I want to thank the listeners and viewers that understand
[34:20.320 --> 34:23.920]  that they're trying to censor everyone and shut everybody's advertising money off and
[34:23.920 --> 34:28.680]  bankrupt talk radio and take over Fox News and we have their own memos and Hillary Clinton
[34:28.680 --> 34:33.400]  coming out in her fundraising emails. This isn't even secret saying we're going to shut
[34:33.400 --> 34:42.440]  down the alt media starting with Breitbart. This is outrageous. And instead they've got
[34:42.440 --> 34:48.640]  pundits on TV going, yeah, that's great. They don't have a right to exist. The refrain
[34:48.640 --> 34:55.840]  now when we go out and cover anti-Trump rallies is, Alex Jones needs to die. Donald Trump
[34:55.840 --> 35:02.400]  needs to die and it's always super weak, pathetic people that just want to throw around talk
[35:02.400 --> 35:09.000]  of killing. It's so historic. It's got all the telltale signs of society about to go
[35:09.000 --> 35:15.480]  completely belly up. And again, Germany says brace for a giant emergency. The German government
[35:15.480 --> 35:21.040]  does. We write a story about it and people go, oh, you're fear mongering. I'm fear mongering.
[35:21.040 --> 35:24.760]  German banks are teetering on the verge of collapse. That's mainstream German news that
[35:24.760 --> 35:31.600]  will make Lehman Brothers in 2007 and 2008 look like a breeze, a summer breeze compared
[35:31.600 --> 35:41.680]  to a typhoon, a hurricane, a tempest, a maelstrom. You can see it intellectually. You can feel
[35:41.680 --> 35:46.160]  it. I mean, I am, I told you, building up the last few years, my concern, my spirit has
[35:46.160 --> 35:51.280]  been really concerned five times, whatever it was, 10 times, 20 times. It's now just
[35:51.280 --> 36:01.640]  full blast. Spider sense is, oh my God. And then I can look at it happening. And you can
[36:01.640 --> 36:04.760]  look at the headlines and what they're doing and how they're pitching it. And then you
[36:04.760 --> 36:08.240]  can go, oh, let me go actually read what Davos said about this three years ago and you go
[36:08.240 --> 36:12.840]  read it. And it's exactly what they're doing. I mean, you, but I don't need to go read their
[36:12.840 --> 36:17.080]  documents anymore. I've got their plan because I've watched them lay it out. It's like they're
[36:17.080 --> 36:20.360]  laying out more railroad track in front of me and I see where it's going. And I'm like,
[36:20.360 --> 36:25.840]  oh my God, this is unbelievable. You talk about a highway to hell. People think of that
[36:25.840 --> 36:30.200]  an ACDC song as some, you know, some fun place. No, this isn't fun where we're going.
[36:30.200 --> 36:35.640]  A lot of people say, Alex, don't fear monger, you know, don't scare us. What's it? It's
[36:35.640 --> 36:40.000]  not fair monger. Our house is on fire. We, our only hope is to admit this is going on.
[36:40.000 --> 36:44.040]  When I say repent, I don't mean to go to some establishment government run church and worship
[36:44.040 --> 36:52.600]  some, you know, preacher, like he's God. I mean, you really get on our knees and repent
[36:52.600 --> 36:58.440]  just for everything going on in the world. I'll tell you, it really gets to me. I, in
[36:58.440 --> 37:02.920]  my spirit, my gut, I feel guilty for all this stuff. And I see the evil increasing and it's
[37:02.920 --> 37:10.200]  so horrible. And it also wants to hurt innocent people. And I just feel like I'm on fire to
[37:10.200 --> 37:15.800]  resist it. I mean, I don't know how to describe it. It's like, well, we need to fight this
[37:15.800 --> 37:21.680]  right now. We need to do something. And the impetus I had 25 years ago to fight, you know,
[37:21.680 --> 37:29.880]  it was there, but it was more like just a push. Now it's like a torrent. And I just simply
[37:29.880 --> 37:37.000]  want to ignite people's gut level instincts to see evil and to see tyranny and to see
[37:37.000 --> 37:41.600]  how if you're in a parking lot and some shady guys start getting around you, you know, oh
[37:41.600 --> 37:48.840]  my God, I'm about to get shaken down. Everybody's urban shaken down. That's how most muggings
[37:48.840 --> 37:51.800]  happen. People just brandish a gun or a knife or say, we're going to beat the hell out of
[37:51.800 --> 37:55.320]  you. Give us your money. You should do it to women. The point is, we're being surrounded
[37:55.320 --> 38:00.480]  and they're shaking us down. And we're going, Oh, thank you, new world order. You're so
[38:00.480 --> 38:04.640]  nice. Because the mainstream media continues to run this con game that what they're doing
[38:04.640 --> 38:09.920]  is okay. It's not okay. It's a false illusion. And people are seeing through that illusion,
[38:09.920 --> 38:13.880]  but they can't have any independent media out there. They'll say back to the public.
[38:13.880 --> 38:24.720]  Yes, you're right. What you see is wrong. 6% trust rate in mainstream media. So that's
[38:24.720 --> 38:30.640]  where all this is going. I'm not going to belabor it. We sell the very best products,
[38:30.640 --> 38:36.120]  the very best nutraceuticals out there at very, very low prices. We have the best selenium
[38:36.120 --> 38:42.240]  from our research. It's just amazing for the mustard seed, such a key element. Just go
[38:42.240 --> 38:48.880]  research selenium for yourself and then realize why you want bio true selenium from infowarslife.com.
[38:48.880 --> 38:52.520]  Everybody needs multivitamins and most of them are synthetic or you don't absorb them.

[38:57.800 --> 39:03.760]  derived vitamin mineral fusion with the amino acids and their cofactors. Great way to get
[39:03.760 --> 39:10.480]  your kids to be healthier and to actually absorb their multivitamin. A true game changer
[39:10.480 --> 39:17.440]  available in infowarslife.com. To spread the word, we have the Hillers for Prison shirts
[39:17.440 --> 39:24.640]  that are at cost, $9.95. That includes shipping. $9.95 is what it cost us to print them, ship
[39:24.640 --> 39:34.560]  them out the door to your door. infowarsstore.com is the umbrella site. And then that funds
[39:34.560 --> 39:42.200]  the running of this media operation. What you can see is changing the world because
[39:42.200 --> 39:47.480]  you are changing the world. But more importantly than even buying the products, I do ask for
[39:47.480 --> 39:56.160]  your prayers. And I do ask that you make sure that all of our efforts are not in vain and
[39:56.160 --> 40:01.440]  that you send out the videos, the articles, the information we put out and that you save
[40:01.440 --> 40:07.440]  it and you make copies of it and you share it with people. And we need a desperation.
[40:07.440 --> 40:12.480]  And people always misinterpret the term desperation and just think of somebody who's totally
[40:12.480 --> 40:17.680]  given up on an island that's going to starve to death and then they have desperation. It's
[40:17.680 --> 40:21.200]  larger than that. And I forget who ever one of the most famous samurais was, but I've
[40:21.200 --> 40:28.800]  quoted the quote many times that the way of the samurai is desperate. And that means in
[40:28.800 --> 40:33.320]  a fight, like everything you've got, you're desperate. You're desperate to get the car
[40:33.320 --> 40:38.480]  off your little kid. And people see some 60-year-old woman, you know, lift the car off a police
[40:38.480 --> 40:42.680]  officer, see that many times, firefighters, you know, like, how the hell did you do that?
[40:42.680 --> 40:47.280]  That's because the governor's watch is off. We have to get desperate people. We're in
[40:47.280 --> 40:51.880]  desperate straits and the system laughs and giggles and makes fun of everything and tries
[40:51.880 --> 41:00.320]  to transmute us being concerned into that. But I'm personally so on fire with concern.
[41:00.320 --> 41:12.960]  It's like 69 degrees in here. I'm sweating because my body is on fire with the desperation
[41:12.960 --> 41:17.600]  of trying to get people out of their trance. Now I'm going to go to the Trump clip in a
[41:17.600 --> 41:22.400]  moment. I'm going to skip the network break coming up so we have time. But it's here.
[41:22.400 --> 41:26.560]  The censorship is happening. It's intensifying. They say they're coming for us. They have
[41:26.560 --> 41:31.360]  attorney generals meeting wanting to arrest people that deny man-made climate change.
[41:31.360 --> 41:35.120]  They are persecuting people in the schools. They're annihilating free speech. They're
[41:35.120 --> 41:40.320]  blurring Trump shirts on TV when they invite someone on as a guest who's a hero. It is
[41:40.320 --> 41:46.480]  total management crafting. It is propaganda to the 10th level. Remember two years ago,
[41:46.480 --> 41:59.240]  Congress quote legalized the CIA involved in domestic propaganda. And then the deputy
[41:59.240 --> 42:06.920]  secretary of defense came out and gave a speech to the military and civilian psychological
[42:06.920 --> 42:14.400]  warfare group. 45 minute long speech. I played it. And they talked about the drudge effect
[42:14.400 --> 42:18.920]  and they said we can't lie anymore because we'll get caught by the internet drudge being
[42:18.920 --> 42:25.440]  emblematic of that. And it cut to the people in the audience and the older ones look completely
[42:25.440 --> 42:32.720]  sick because they knew what this really was. This was the announcement of we're going operational
[42:32.720 --> 42:37.120]  here domestically and you're going to go out and do it. But then they had some younger
[42:37.120 --> 42:43.360]  people that were in PR and writing for armed services publications get up and go this is
[42:43.360 --> 42:50.840]  great because I really don't like having to lie to people. Oh, thank you. Oh, we're gonna
[42:50.840 --> 43:04.960]  tell the truth now. But it goes further than that because at that very time, large sections
[43:04.960 --> 43:09.520]  of the military were actually refusing to go along with it. So see what they even claimed
[43:09.520 --> 43:15.840]  they were doing, even though it was a scythe backfired, because at this point, with a general
[43:15.840 --> 43:20.920]  population that is in a trance won't stand up for anybody, including themselves. Who's
[43:20.920 --> 43:26.600]  the only group they know that has twisted and screwed up in many cases as they are,
[43:26.600 --> 43:31.280]  like all of us, the military, their phase of the military out right now, they're bringing
[43:31.280 --> 43:36.920]  an automation, they're bringing in machines. They've got all the movies and video games
[43:36.920 --> 43:41.400]  priming the little girls to not be princesses or doctors or no, no, you're going to be a
[43:41.400 --> 43:48.120]  soldier now. You're going to be a technocrat. And I was just thinking about how they're
[43:48.120 --> 43:57.480]  installing dictators in Italy and in other countries like Greece where they actually
[43:57.480 --> 44:04.560]  put Goldman Sachs presidents and Goldman Sachs directors in and they say, oh, we call this
[44:04.560 --> 44:22.080]  technocracy when we install someone. I remember that major bank head. When I was on the airplane
[44:22.080 --> 44:29.840]  off record, where I tell you his name, just looking at me and going, Alex, the big banks
[44:29.840 --> 44:33.880]  know how to run things better. And soon we're going to run everything. And you think the
[44:33.880 --> 44:37.840]  public's going to adapt and wake up and fight this. No, they're going to adapt to submitting
[44:37.840 --> 44:48.000]  to it because basically humanity done. And he had the perfect hair and the perfect smug
[44:48.000 --> 44:51.040]  face and the perfect suit that didn't even look wrinkled after a three and a half hour
[44:51.040 --> 44:54.960]  flight from Austin to New York. And he got his black trench coat and put it over his
[44:54.960 --> 45:05.160]  arm and just laughed at me. But in my hours of conversation where they sit in first class
[45:05.160 --> 45:15.520]  right beside me, when he talked about his dad, a general who he was visiting in San Antonio,
[45:15.520 --> 45:18.920]  you know, he looked like he loved his dad and had this look in his eye. Yeah, my dad's
[45:18.920 --> 45:26.160]  getting old. This guy would look like he was about 60. And it's like you care about your
[45:26.160 --> 45:30.680]  dad, but you don't care about the general public because you think they're stupid, but
[45:30.680 --> 45:35.520]  the ruling engineers admit they designed it to make people even stupider than they already
[45:35.520 --> 45:41.360]  would be. So you care about your daddy, but you don't care about people around you who
[45:41.360 --> 45:46.960]  aren't your family. So you're not a psychopath. You're an arrogant person that just wants
[45:46.960 --> 45:59.040]  power. You're a control freak. And you better hope there's not a hell buddy boy. And I will
[45:59.040 --> 46:10.640]  assure you there is one dimension over, sweetie pie. One jump. And you're not going to be
[46:10.640 --> 46:18.400]  here anymore. When you go through that portal that atheists and everybody else go through
[46:18.400 --> 46:24.440]  and every person from every culture throughout time says they see when you die, you're going
[46:24.440 --> 46:31.880]  to have to go be with people like you. That's all you just go like a magnet to who you are.
[46:31.880 --> 46:37.920]  You want to be like this at the next level. When we graduate from this level, that's how
[46:37.920 --> 46:42.520]  the universe works. When we go to the next level, you don't want to go to the next level,
[46:42.520 --> 46:52.360]  do you? You want to go down a level, don't you? They call that hell. Now, it's hell because
[46:52.360 --> 47:00.360]  there's people like you in it. You make it hell. You and your hate and your greed and
[47:00.360 --> 47:07.440]  your weakness and your dishonor consume yourselves. You're your own kindling. It's metaphysical.
[47:07.440 --> 47:13.840]  Mark Taipel. It's poetry in motion. I want to play the incredible Trump speech here.
[47:13.840 --> 47:16.320]  And then we've got a bunch of big guests they haven't even gotten to. They're being censored.
[47:16.320 --> 47:21.600]  You name it. I've got the Chinese style social credit. Oh, it's a social credit. If you criticize
[47:21.600 --> 47:24.440]  government or corporations, we just don't let you operate on the internet anymore and
[47:24.440 --> 47:29.160]  you get a low score. And then you physically can't have a job either. Mark of the beast.
[47:29.160 --> 47:32.680]  What it is, Mark of the beast. If you're not a good little globalist, you won't be able
[47:32.680 --> 47:37.520]  to use the internet. And that's what YouTube has announced. They're beginning. Oh, if we
[47:37.520 --> 47:44.320]  decide, if the social community diversity team is what it's called, people complain.
[47:44.320 --> 47:48.720]  And then, and then, and then we decide in the little proletariat meeting in little commissar
[47:48.720 --> 47:54.720]  meeting, then you, you don't get to make money on your channel anymore. We're going to make
[47:54.720 --> 48:01.960]  money on it and break our deal with you. They were always planning this care to the stick.
[48:01.960 --> 48:07.760]  Now Donald Trump, the statesman, the pure presidential material, the man, like not a
[48:07.760 --> 48:21.120]  faker, like David fighting Goliath. He I guess would be King David, but we don't want to
[48:21.120 --> 48:29.080]  be blessed, do we? No, we want, uh, Jezebel. That's what we want. And boy, if she doesn't
[48:29.080 --> 48:38.840]  fit the bill of Jezebel perfectly tailored, nobody does. He goes to Mexico and I said
[48:38.840 --> 48:44.160]  yesterday and Trump didn't get this from me. Trump understands the battle better than I
[48:44.160 --> 48:49.200]  do. And I said, we don't know what he's gonna say in Mexico. There's big news out of no
[48:49.200 --> 48:51.640]  one knows what he's gonna say. And I said yesterday over and over again, I said, he
[48:51.640 --> 48:55.160]  goes down there. He needs to say, let's fight the new world order and globalism together.
[48:55.160 --> 49:01.160]  Let's come together. Let's defeat this. Let's not be controlled by multinationals. Let's
[49:01.160 --> 49:07.200]  have America and Mexico neighbors team up to build each other up. It's something he's
[49:07.200 --> 49:13.520]  saying to Russia. And they took this olive branch and the media spun it. It was a horrible
[49:13.520 --> 49:18.120]  thing. And he did say, I'm sovereign. You're sovereign. America's sovereign. We can't do
[49:18.120 --> 49:22.440]  this. You just, people just can't come over to Mexico and do whatever they want. That's
[49:22.440 --> 49:28.160]  the same thing here. You know, that's common sense. He talked to the public. He talked
[49:28.160 --> 49:32.880]  to the Americans, the people of the world, but directly to the Mexicans and said, I don't
[49:32.880 --> 49:39.800]  think you're stupid. I'm not going to dumb this argument down. Here is Donald Trump's
[49:39.800 --> 49:43.960]  address in Mexico yesterday before he got on the plane and went and gave a bunch of
[49:43.960 --> 49:49.520]  other speeches. Here's this. There's now here the words of the Republican candidate to the
[49:49.520 --> 49:56.520]  presidency of the United States of America, Mr. Donald Trump. Thank you. It is a great
[49:56.520 --> 50:04.760]  honor to be invited by you, Mr. President. A great, great honor. Thank you. We had a very
[50:04.760 --> 50:14.880]  substantive, direct and constructive exchange of ideas over quite a period of time. I was
[50:14.880 --> 50:22.840]  straightforward and presenting my views about the impacts of current trade and immigration
[50:22.840 --> 50:30.600]  policies on the United States. As you know, I love the United States very much and we
[50:30.600 --> 50:38.280]  want to make sure that the people of the United States are very well protected. You equally
[50:38.280 --> 50:46.520]  expressed your feelings and your love for Mexico. United States and Mexico share a 2,000-mile
[50:46.520 --> 50:55.080]  border, a half a trillion dollars in annual trade, and one million legal border crossings
[50:55.080 --> 51:03.880]  each and every day. We are united by our support for democracy, a great love for our people,
[51:03.880 --> 51:11.920]  and the contributions of millions of Mexican Americans to the United States. And I happen
[51:11.920 --> 51:18.600]  to have a tremendous feeling for Mexican Americans, not only in terms of friendships, but in
[51:18.600 --> 51:24.160]  terms of the tremendous numbers that I employ in the United States, and they are amazing
[51:24.160 --> 51:30.240]  people, amazing people. I have many friends, so many friends, and so many friends coming
[51:30.240 --> 51:38.640]  to Mexico and in Mexico. I am proud to say how many people I employ. And the United States,
[51:38.640 --> 51:48.480]  first, second, and third generation Mexicans are just beyond reproach, spectacular, spectacular,
[51:48.480 --> 51:55.600]  hardworking people. I have such great respect for them and their strong values of family,
[51:55.600 --> 52:06.480]  faith, and community. We all share a common interest in keeping our hemisphere safe, prosperous,
[52:06.480 --> 52:15.920]  and free. No one wins in either country when human smugglers and drug traffickers prey on
[52:15.920 --> 52:23.360]  innocent people, when cartels commit acts of violence, when illegal weapons and cash
[52:23.360 --> 52:30.960]  flow from the United States into Mexico, or when migrants from Central America make the
[52:30.960 --> 52:39.440]  dangerous trek, and it is very, very dangerous, into Mexico or the United States without legal
[52:39.440 --> 52:48.040]  authorization. I shared my strong view that NAFTA has been a far greater benefit to Mexico
[52:48.040 --> 52:55.200]  than it has been to the United States, and that it must be improved upon to make sure
[52:55.200 --> 53:04.800]  that workers and so important in both countries benefit from fair and reciprocal trade. I
[53:04.800 --> 53:11.880]  express that to the United States, and that of the United States, that we must take action
[53:11.880 --> 53:21.800]  to stem this tremendous outflow of jobs from our country. It's happening every day, it's
[53:21.800 --> 53:28.800]  getting worse and worse and worse, and we have to stop it. Prosperity and happiness in both
[53:28.800 --> 53:37.480]  of our countries will increase if we work together on the following five shared goals.
[53:37.480 --> 53:45.360]  Number one, ending illegal immigration. Not just between our two countries, but including
[53:45.360 --> 53:51.280]  the illegal immigration and migration from Central and South Americans and from other
[53:51.280 --> 54:00.280]  regions that impact security and finances in both Mexico and the United States. This
[54:00.280 --> 54:09.000]  is a humanitarian disaster. The dangerous treks, the abuse by gangs and cartels, and
[54:09.000 --> 54:18.000]  the extreme physical dangers, and it must be solved, it must be solved quickly. Not
[54:18.000 --> 54:25.320]  fair to the people anywhere worldwide, you could truly say, but certainly not fair to
[54:25.320 --> 54:30.720]  the people of Mexico or the people of the United States. Number two, having a secure
[54:30.720 --> 54:38.720]  border is a sovereign right and mutually beneficial. We recognize and respect the right of either
[54:38.720 --> 54:47.120]  country to build a physical barrier or wall on any of its borders to stop the illegal
[54:47.120 --> 54:56.000]  movement of people, drugs, and weapons. Cooperation toward achieving this shared objective, and
[54:56.000 --> 55:03.840]  it will be shared, of safety for all citizens is paramount to both the United States and
[55:03.840 --> 55:09.120]  to Mexico. Number three, dismantling drug cartels and ending the movement.
[55:09.120 --> 55:12.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've got to hit pause here because of developments. I knew that
[55:12.280 --> 55:17.800]  Matt Lauer was doing a so-called debate and I predicted on air that they were going to
[55:17.800 --> 55:21.600]  somehow try to cancel the debates. And if this is accurate, and Daily Caller is very
[55:21.600 --> 55:25.920]  accurate and I'm going over the sources here, in fact it's been announced by the debate
[55:25.920 --> 55:33.640]  commission, they've canceled the debate is what this is. But in an exercise in brainwashing,
[55:33.640 --> 55:37.920]  even alternative media doesn't get what the headline should be. They're going to be on
[55:37.920 --> 55:46.360]  different stages back to back to control it in case Trump says something they don't want
[55:46.360 --> 55:51.680]  said. This is unbelievable. I mean, we knew he'd destroy her. This is how rigged it is.
[55:51.680 --> 55:56.480]  They've already installed leaders in Europe. The globalists have already stolen all these
[55:56.480 --> 56:02.000]  elections. They've got Homeland Security taking over the election. They're saying they want
[56:02.000 --> 56:08.000]  a sense of the press. And now it's on DrudgeReport.com. We're putting it on Infowars.com. Matt
[56:08.000 --> 56:15.800]  Lauer will moderate first forum between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Wow. But then it's
[56:15.800 --> 56:22.520]  not that. This is being reported by NBC News along with the Iraq and Afghanistan. This
[56:22.520 --> 56:28.840]  is insane. It will be a one hour forum where Clinton and Trump will answer questions about
[56:28.840 --> 56:33.760]  national security. Now it's an hour. It should be two hours. Oh my gosh. It will be a one
[56:33.760 --> 56:37.320]  hour forum where Clinton and Trump will answer questions about national security, military
[56:37.320 --> 56:41.160]  affairs and veterans issues in front of an audience mainly made up of members of the
[56:41.160 --> 56:45.120]  military. The two candidates will not be on stage at the same time, but will instead go
[56:45.120 --> 56:48.760]  back to back. They're going to have them look like the military attacks Trump. Oh my God,
[56:48.760 --> 56:53.560]  this is a Psyop. He's walking into a trap and they're doing this so he'll quote cancel
[56:53.560 --> 56:57.200]  saying it's not a real debate because it's not a debate. And then they'll say he's a
[56:57.200 --> 57:01.480]  sore loser. I mean, they're asking him to get in a boxing match when the other guys got
[57:01.480 --> 57:09.280]  a machine gun. It will be a one hour forum where Clinton and Trump will answer questions
[57:09.280 --> 57:15.160]  about national security. The two candidates will not be on the stage at the same time,
[57:15.160 --> 57:20.840]  but will instead go back to back. And of course, the media is making it all about how he's
[57:20.840 --> 57:28.040]  on the Clinton Foundation global initiative payroll. He works with them, but that's not
[57:28.040 --> 57:34.920]  even the issue. That's a big issue, but back to back. They're not even going. Oh, she's
[57:34.920 --> 57:39.760]  definitely got something wrong with her. She cannot even be out there for an hour. Instead,
[57:39.760 --> 57:48.600]  we'll go back to back. That means one goes on for 30 minutes. That's all she can handle.
[57:48.600 --> 57:54.080]  And then Trump comes in, print me every article, every debate, commission statement on this.
[57:54.080 --> 57:59.840]  This is the number one story right now. I am physically cannot handle it. And by that,
[57:59.840 --> 58:04.720]  I mean, physically, it feels like it's even wrong to be here on air calmly talking about
[58:04.720 --> 58:14.360]  this. I mean, this is outrageous. We should be in the streets. And their strength is
[58:14.360 --> 58:20.080]  our weakness. I look at how their supporters are these lazy, stupid zombies and politically
[58:20.080 --> 58:28.960]  correct morons and dumbed down buffoons and empty headed victims of this system. I just
[58:28.960 --> 58:32.720]  wish I could reach these people. I mean, I'm not calling them stupid to feel powerful.
[58:32.720 --> 58:37.120]  The globalists have made them dumb so they can be ruled over, but still they're like
[58:37.120 --> 58:42.200]  dangerous piranha. We'll be right back folks. Second hour. There's so much coming up. They're
[58:42.200 --> 58:47.320]  launching the takeover, folks. This is more proof. This is this is Soviet Union level
[58:47.320 --> 58:50.560]  crap. Okay.

[59:52.480 --> 01:00:18.560]  Or listening to the Alex Jones show. From the front lines of the information war, it's
[01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:33.200]  Alex Jones of safety for all citizens is paramount to both the United States and to Mexico.
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:39.560]  Number three, dismantling drug cartels and ending the movement of illegal drugs, weapons
[01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:49.720]  and funds across our border. This can only be done with cooperation, intelligence and
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:57.160]  intelligence sharing and joint operations between our two countries. It's the only way
[01:00:57.160 --> 01:01:05.720]  it's going to happen. Improving NAFTA number four. NAFTA is a 22 year old agreement that
[01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:12.800]  must be updated to reflect the realities of today. There are many improvements that could
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:20.840]  be made that would make both Mexico and the United States stronger and keep industry in
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:28.400]  our hemisphere. We have tremendous competition from China and from all over the world. Keep
[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:36.880]  it in our hemisphere. Workers in both of our countries need a pay raise very desperately
[01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:45.360]  in the United States. It's been 18 years, 18 years. Wages are going down. Improving
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:52.560]  pay standards and working conditions will create better results for all and all workers
[01:01:52.560 --> 01:02:00.560]  in particular. There's a lot of value that can be created for both countries by working
[01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:10.360]  beautifully together and that I am sure will happen. Number five, keep manufacturing wealth
[01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:18.480]  in our hemisphere. When jobs leave Mexico, the U.S. or Central America and go overseas,
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:27.360]  it increases poverty and pressure on social services as well as pressures on cross-border
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:36.800]  migration. Tremendous pressure. The bond between our two countries is deep and sincere and
[01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:44.080]  both our nations benefit from a close and honest relationship between our two governments.
[01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:51.040]  A strong, prosperous and vibrant Mexico is in the best interests of the United States
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:03:00.360]  and will keep and help keep for a long, long period of time America together. Both of our
[01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:07.800]  countries will work together for mutual good and most importantly for the mutual good of
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:14.720]  our people. Mr. President, I want to thank you. It's been a tremendous honor and I called
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:20.480]  you a friend. Thank you.
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:24.800]  That was a very, very serious olive branch. It was common sense. It's what Trump really
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:30.800]  represents. But when America has been walked all over, when there are more Chinese a week
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:36.000]  coming in than there are Mexicans and they admit they come here and see it and report
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:47.520]  something like it's a good thing to have babies free and to get citizenship. And the articles
[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:54.120]  when you read them say strangely, it's mainly wealthy Chinese. Well, yeah, we've got better
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:04:00.920]  hospitals and you just come on a couple of month vacation and you have your baby and
[01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:07.920]  it's all paid for. And then the baby's a citizen. Nobody else lets you do that. But
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:16.760]  Germany and places like that because they're absolutely trying to bankrupt and create division.
[01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:22.480]  That's wrong. I can't go to China and get stuff free. It's not racist. And I'm not even
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:29.440]  going to play race card on that issue. I mean, I could like I'll have to play it and I'm
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:35.880]  not racist against Asians. My sister's Korean adopted. I love Asians. Of course I do. Point
[01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:40.800]  is I don't have to stay in preface it with that. I show up in China and say I have my
[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:48.360]  baby free. They would arrest me. If you smart off to Chinese police, they cut your testicles
[01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:56.120]  off in the street. Seriously, look it up. Walk you up, cut your testicles off. That's
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:05:00.360]  what I do. Look it up.
[01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:04.200]  The House Oversight Committee Chairman and the House Judiciary Committee Chairman are
[01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:08.360]  both raising the issue of whether Hillary Clinton committed perjury when she testified
[01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:12.680]  under oath to Congress. The discrepancies between what she said and what FBI Director
[01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:18.000]  Comey said are obvious even to the casual observer. But you may say because the Justice
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:22.840]  Department is so politicized, they won't ever prosecute Hillary for crimes she commits.
[01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:26.520]  And you're right. But the President of Judicial Watch, which has been at the forefront of
[01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:30.760]  investigating the corruption and the national security violations of Hillary Clinton, points
[01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:35.400]  out in an interview with a Daily Mail, quote, one of the dirty little secrets in Washington
[01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:40.200]  is that Mrs. Clinton can be impeached now. A federal official leaving office does not
[01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:45.160]  end congressional jurisdiction over impeachment for misconduct in that office. And if Hillary
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:50.680]  was convicted by the Senate, the sanction could be indefinitely for future office, unquote.
[01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:55.320]  Will Congress grow spine and check the corruption? If they don't do it in an election year, they
[01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:56.320]  won't ever.
[01:05:56.320 --> 01:06:22.280]  I'm David Knight.

[01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:31.440]  children, to the best job you can to purify your error. The elite are masters at poisoning
[01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:36.760]  our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most toxic effects
[01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:41.680]  for themselves. The general public doesn't. The elects of pure breeze will be a steal
[01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:47.480]  at $300, $400, $500. One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:51.040]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more

[01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:18.440]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening
[01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:20.320]  to Alex Jones.
[01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:32.000]  All right, thedrugreport.com has a daily caller article linked up that the first debate isn't
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:36.720]  a debate at all. It's an event where Hillary goes back to back with Trump two different
[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:42.440]  stages, and they take basically pre-screened questions. You can bet your bottom dollar
[01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:46.280]  on that. Now, they say they're going to have other debates that'll be actual debates. We'll
[01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:50.120]  see if that happens, because she never goes out on stage more than 15, 20 minutes, and
[01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:55.600]  she never speaks more than about eight minutes. Now, I've got somebody who I'm a huge fan
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:09:00.640]  of. I know most of you are probably fans. I know Buckley, you're an obviously huge fan.
[01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:05.480]  Years ago, it hanged Dilbert cartoons on his wall. In fact, the whole wall of them. Dilbert
[01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:10.960]  creator endorses Hillary out of fear for personal safety. Remember that article that
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:15.920]  Don Salazar wrote back on June 6? So many death threats, so many attacks. Okay, okay,
[01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:21.240]  I will support her. You bet. Please back off. And of course, that's tongue-in-cheek in
[01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:26.680]  my view. We're going to talk to the man himself here in just a moment. But imagine even his
[01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:33.960]  light-hearted cartoons got massive threats. Can you imagine the threats we get? Can you
[01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:39.720]  imagine? Again, I've never seen this level of behavior. And the New York Times calling
[01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:42.880]  for Donald Trump to be killed. So I thought we'd play a little boil down, because why
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:47.560]  this guy's even more interesting, not just for his cartoons, but all the predictions
[01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:54.520]  he's made that have come true, sometimes decades before. Really uncanny. So obviously
[01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:58.840]  a smart guy. We're going to be going to him here in just a moment. Here's the short boil
[01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:04.560]  down of Scott Adams, the creator and artist behind Dilbert, looking into his crystal ball.
[01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:09.800]  Joining me to talk Trump is Scott Adams. He's the creator of Dilbert against Scott on his
[01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:14.560]  blog has been analyzing the rise of the Republican frontrunner for months now. And frankly,
[01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:19.280]  he has some of the most interesting and accurate observations about why Trump is appealing to
[01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:24.720]  so many people. And I called him to be the landslide winner in the general election
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:29.840]  last year, because the tools he's using, essentially, he's basically taking a flamethrower
[01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:34.200]  to a stick fight. There's nobody using the same tools he's using. So you have another
[01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:40.280]  theory about Trump saying that he uses certain words and almost almost hypnotizes the audience.
[01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:45.240]  What do you mean by that? So for background, I'm a trained hypnotist and I've been studying
[01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:50.240]  persuasion all of my life as part of what I do for a living as a writer. And I noticed
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:55.680]  back in August of last year that Trump was using persuasion techniques to perfection
[01:10:55.680 --> 01:11:00.480]  when it looked like he was just a crazy clown saying random things. But if you look at his
[01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:05.440]  method from a trained persuaders point of view, it's been perfect perfection from the
[01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:09.600]  beginning. It just looks random to someone who's not trained and had a persuasion. His
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:14.360]  complete scoring of facts are actually part of the persuasion because he doesn't give
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:20.840]  you targets, he doesn't give you details of his policies usually. So he's reducing the
[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:25.600]  number of targets while making you feel good and focus on the things he wants. So it's
[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:28.000]  not about facts, it's about focus and attention.
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.520]  Is this like what you're talking about when you say like the linguistic kill shot, whether
[01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:34.160]  calling Jeb Bush low energy or something else?
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:38.440]  Yeah, so the linguistic kill shot is finding some kind of an insult, if you can call it
[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:42.520]  that, that sticks like other insults would not. And he likes to pick things that are
[01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:47.200]  visual, you look at the person and say, yeah, that, that feels kind of right. But he also
[01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:51.400]  picks words and phrases that haven't been used before. So they haven't been polluted
[01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:56.240]  by other meaning, which is a good technique. So when you say somebody's low energy, there's
[01:11:56.240 --> 01:11:58.640]  nobody else that you ever talked about like that.
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:01.880]  When I heard low energy, I called low energy, right?
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:07.400]  Yeah, I called the end of Bush that day, because that is a sticky insult. So these are not random
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:08.400]  insults.
[01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:11.880]  I'm not saying they're random. I'm not saying they don't work. I'm just saying he brands
[01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:17.560]  people low energy, crazy, crooked, but there's something else to it. He's, he's working on
[01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:22.200]  confirmation bias. When you see anything come out in the news that looks like maybe Hillary
[01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:27.120]  Clinton did something a little bit suspicious, you say crooked Hillary. The brilliant thing
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:32.600]  he did recently was he came up with a second one for Clinton. He said, well, is she heartless?
[01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:37.680]  Is a heartless Hillary? Or is a crooked Hillary? And he actually made people debate whether
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:44.000]  she was more heartless or more crooked. And that's all intentional. This is all a technique.
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:47.800]  Democrats like to say that they'd love to run against Trump. You, you clearly think
[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:49.680]  that they're underestimating him.
[01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:56.760]  Yeah, based on his talent stack alone, if you look at any individual talent he has,
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:13:00.680]  you could say, well, that's not the best in the world. But look how many he's put together.
[01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:05.880]  He knows strategy, business strategy. He knows negotiating. He's the best persuader I've
[01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:11.640]  ever seen. He's quick in his feet. He's funny. He, uh, you know, he's smart enough. He knows
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:15.840]  enough about politics. So when you put that stack together, nobody really stands up to
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:19.960]  that stack. I, I've been predicting he's going to win in the landslides since last year.
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:23.560]  Not just in the nomination, but the presidency. Yeah, I think it'll be one of the biggest
[01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:28.640]  margins of victory in history.
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:35.680]  There you go. Now Scott Adams joins us. Scott, I've got to say that I, I think a lot of what
[01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:43.160]  you would call trained programming is actually just instinctive in alpha males and leaders.
[01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:47.120]  And sure he's, he's gotten better at it, uh, and, and, and it made it more technical over
[01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:51.000]  the years as a manager and a salesman, but people think all the time I'm doing trained
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:54.480]  stuff, I was never trained in anything. I really mean what I'm saying. I think the missing
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:58.520]  element of what you were saying there is it is true. She's crooked. It is true. She's
[01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:01.840]  obviously got health problems, even Obama's doctor. I mean, I think what really makes
[01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:05.840]  Trump powerful is that he's telling the truth. And, and yes, sometimes he does simplify. What
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:09.200]  do you say? Scott Adams creator of Dilbert blog.dilbert.com.
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:14.040]  Well, people can't tell the difference between the truth and something that's totally made
[01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:20.000]  up that that is one of the powers we don't possess. What we do instead, and this is something
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:25.200]  you need to understand to be a hypnotist is that people are rational all the time. So
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:31.360]  what we really think is truth is usually confirmation bias. Now say things can be true
[01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:37.800]  also by coincidence, but usually we individuals don't have access to the, you know, the base
[01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:41.640]  facts. We're just hearing it from somebody else. We're putting it together from clues
[01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:46.960]  in our environment. So most of what we recognize to be truth is really just confirmation bias.
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:51.360]  And this is true on both sides, by the way, I agree for the general dumb down public.
[01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:58.680]  But I mean, we deal in the real, I mean, I do the real system, the real program of how
[01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:03.200]  cultures set up and operating and the different competing systems. And I find Trump to be
[01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:07.480]  very, very accurate, very, very on target. I mean, his speech in Mexico, that had a lot
[01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:08.480]  of facts in it.
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:13.000]  It did. And that's part of his persuasion, because if you look at what the other side
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:18.760]  was trying to do to him, they're persuaders. And I think there's one in particular who's
[01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:25.240]  probably behind it. I've speculated that Robert Childini, who is famous for writing the book
[01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:31.760]  Influence, who would be one of the best influencers in the world, might be consulting for Clinton.
[01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:37.520]  He did help Obama's campaign. So it would be, it would be odd if he wasn't helping this
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:44.840]  time as well. But the situation that they'd set up is a confirmation bias trap that they
[01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:51.120]  built around Trump that made his opponents think that everything he did was one of these
[01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:57.360]  things. It's either crazy or uninformed, or it's racist, or it's another sign of his
[01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:03.440]  thin skin and his bad temperament. So they've set up a bunch of confirmation bias traps
[01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:08.760]  that everything he does can be interpreted to be one of those things if you're already
[01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:12.920]  inclined to think that way. So that's how persuasion works. Now, it's the same technique
[01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:19.440]  that Trump uses in the other direction. But so what he needed to do to try to wiggle out
[01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:25.640]  of that trap is try to do anything that showed he is well informed, at least on one topic.
[01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:31.120]  And I think having 10 bullet points and talking about it for, I don't know, how long you talk,
[01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:37.360]  45 minutes or an hour, I think he's sold that. So the people who said Trump can't learn,
[01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:40.600]  he doesn't care about the details. He's not serious.
[01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:45.920]  Was it a daring and really smart move to go to New Orleans and the flooding when Hillary
[01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:49.640]  wouldn't to go to Mexico and then say, you know, get down here, Hillary?
[01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:55.440]  Yeah, that's great optics because he's also working on the impression which he's created
[01:16:55.440 --> 01:17:00.280]  that Hillary doesn't have this stamina. It looks presidential when he's standing next
[01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:06.400]  to a president. Yeah. So he's got all the optics right. And that also works toward the
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:11.400]  is he a crazy racist because you see him talking to the president of Mexico and the two of
[01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:16.000]  them are getting along fine. You know, it didn't turn into a slap fight.
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:20.800]  The Mexican president's body language after the meeting was he really suddenly liked Trump.
[01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:25.680]  Well, everything I hear about Trump in person is that people do like him in person. His
[01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:31.320]  personality is a little bit different in public. And it's even different again at a rally than
[01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:35.720]  it is at a press conference. Yeah, I mean, the Trump people see on the
[01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:43.000]  trail and stuff is Trump. But the Trump behind the scenes is like the guys got amazing charisma
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:49.240]  and he's very smart. That's why I hear. And by the way, the definition of charisma, according
[01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:54.880]  to the scientists is kind of interesting. Charisma, say the experts is a combination
[01:17:54.880 --> 01:18:01.200]  of power plus empathy. Now he's already he's already got the power. So people people already
[01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:06.160]  saw that. And and if they didn't see that, they saw him just annihilate the competitors
[01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:09.360]  in the primaries. And so now they believe he has power.
[01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:13.440]  Can't we have this guy's president? I mean, this is awesome. He's got to be president.
[01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:18.800]  But hold on part two, part two is where his problem was. He had the power for charisma,
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:24.440]  but he lacked the empathy because he was taking a hard nose approach to immigration and other
[01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:29.000]  other topics. And so that made him look like, well, maybe he's a little stupid, but don't
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.320]  you think that's the tactic is to be, you know, the good cop, bad cop. He's first the
[01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:38.760]  bad cop. Now he's a good cop. I think he needed a different tactic in the primaries, of course,
[01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:44.120]  and he needed to soften it in the general. And he's well on his way to doing that. So
[01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:47.520]  I think his immigration speech was a huge step.
[01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:51.240]  Well, Scott Adams, I would love to have you on sometimes just about your the technicals
[01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:55.520]  being hypnotized, you know, all your amazing, you know, comics, Dilbert dot com blog dot
[01:18:55.520 --> 01:19:01.960]  Dilbert dot com. But, but specifically though, you say you got so many threats that you endorsed
[01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:06.360]  Hillary and I can see here you're kind of, I don't see riding the rail, but I think you
[01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:10.400]  like Trump. I mean, I think it's obvious that you want Trump to be president, but in this
[01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:17.240]  media climate of censorship and persecution, you're just giving him backhanded compliments.
[01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:22.080]  That's not exactly true. I'm actually completely serious when I say that I'm endorsing Hillary
[01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:28.400]  Clinton for my physical safety and it's working. So prior to saying that publicly, I was getting
[01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:34.240]  comments on online, mostly on Twitter, comparing me to Joseph Goebbels, you know, Hitler's
[01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:35.240]  PR person.
[01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:40.200]  But in reality, it's Nazi Germany where you have to endorse Hitler or Hitler comes after
[01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:41.200]  you.
[01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:45.200]  Yeah, you could make that argument. But the point is that if I wanted to talk about Trump's
[01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:49.600]  persuasion skills, which is the thing that interested me and my audience, I couldn't
[01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:54.920]  do that with physical safety. If people imagined that that also meant I backed his policies.
[01:19:54.920 --> 01:20:00.640]  And so let me say as clearly as I can, that my personal political preferences don't align
[01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:05.800]  with either Clinton or Trump. I'm not very close to either of them on anything. So if
[01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:10.960]  you say who would I prefer to be president on an entertainment basis, of course, Trump
[01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:17.240]  on a policy basis, I'm not smart enough to know who's got the best policies.
[01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:22.520]  I'm blind. They're creating a new McCarthyism, but with no teeth, claiming that everyone
[01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:26.080]  I mean, Hillary has actually said in her speech when she attacked myself and others
[01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:35.200]  last week that the alt right and right Bart and others and Trump actually take orders
[01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:40.240]  from Vladimir Putin. I mean, I've never been to Russia. It's total bull. I've been on Russian
[01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:43.400]  TV. I've been on Japanese TV and British TV more than Russian TV. I'm not taking orders
[01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:46.360]  from the British either. I've been on Mexican TV. I'm not taking orders from the Mexicans.
[01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:51.320]  I mean, this is a new level. Talk about conspiracy theories. And then she made up stuff that
[01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:56.160]  I supposedly stand for or twisted it and then said, what type of dark heart? I'm going
[01:20:56.160 --> 01:21:00.760]  to play this for you. What type of dark heart does Alex Jones have and clutched her heart?
[01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:04.520]  Clearly it was scripted. I want to ask you as a top hitman says, I know you're famous
[01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:08.520]  for that as well. What do you think of this bit of propaganda? Here it is.
[01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:17.900]  What happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that?
[01:21:17.900 --> 01:21:23.800]  But Trump doesn't challenge these lies. He actually went on Jones's show and said, your
[01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:31.080]  reputation is amazing. I will not let you down. This from the man who wants to be president
[01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:35.800]  of the United States. And I told we haven't found it yet, but I got tweets and calls
[01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:40.400]  about Obama shot his mouth off at some dinner about me last night. But I mean, this is really
[01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:44.600]  getting weird when she's talking about dark hearts and clutching her heart. I mean, what
[01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:48.080]  do you make of that neural linguistic programming?
[01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:54.400]  So you notice that right after the GOP convention, as soon as Trump got done talking, all the
[01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:59.320]  pundits started using the same word, dark. That's not a coincidence. That comes from
[01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:05.200]  somebody who's trained in persuasion on their side. And again, it's probably Childini.
[01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:09.960]  And what dark does is it primes you. And this is something Childini writes about in his
[01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:13.400]  new book called Pre-Swasion, which is coming out in a few weeks. And you should definitely
[01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:19.360]  buy it if you want to understand anything about the election. It sort of primes the
[01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:24.800]  viewer for anything that comes after fitting the mold of dark. So it's a linguistic kill
[01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:29.880]  shot of its own type. And it primes you to see everything in this tinge dark way. But
[01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:36.440]  you notice that six months ago, Clinton's selling points where she's the one with the
[01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:40.560]  experience and the facts and the, you know, she's, she's the rational one.
[01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:43.880]  The history. She's the safe one. She's the steady hand, even though she starts all these
[01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:48.400]  illegal wars and creates failed states. Let's expand on that because Assange, we have this
[01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:52.200]  clip coming up later after you leave us, but it's on infowords.com. WikiLeaks did a New
[01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:55.640]  York Times interview and he said, listen, this woman's a demon. I've got the email.
[01:22:55.640 --> 01:22:59.320]  She's super dangerous. She's a mobster. She's going to hang the press because they are.
[01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:03.840]  I've got stacks. She said in a campaign letter, they're going to shut down the alt conservatives.
[01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:08.000]  I mean, this is bold. I'm holding the daily caller article with the snippets of the email
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:12.040]  right here. They actually say we have no right to exist. Talk about hit Larry and talk about
[01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:18.080]  final solution. And Assange says he finally gave a hint. He said, well, a lot of it is
[01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:22.080]  how they're coordinating everything. It's all coordinated. Well, the earlier email show
[01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:25.960]  that where they're ordering everybody exactly what to do. I mean, this is not what you have
[01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:32.360]  in a free society. Well, let me say you're talking maybe about the WikiLeaks memo about
[01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:37.760]  CNN and their producers talking in advance with before the interviews. That's, that's
[01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:41.440]  what you're talking about. There's thousands of these, oh yes, but coordinating what to
[01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:45.240]  do. I mean, you pointed out how within one minute of the end of Trump's speech, it was
[01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:50.160]  dark, dark, dark everywhere. Articles already written. These talking points go out. All
[01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:54.920]  right. But let me say just on the point of CNN and their producers, it is normal business
[01:23:54.920 --> 01:23:59.000]  for them to discuss in advance what the questions are. They do that with me. They do it that
[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:04.320]  with most of the guests. I don't know that they would do that with the, you know, if
[01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:10.040]  they had one of the candidates on there might be more preparation there, but or less preparation
[01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:13.080]  just so they could suppose there's more coordination than that. I mean, they were like sending
[01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:17.360]  people to go after Trump with Bernie Sanders. People dressed up as Bernie Sanders supporters.
[01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:21.040]  There's a lot of coordination. I'm not sure what you know. Sure. Sure. Yeah. I'm not
[01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:25.200]  saying that there isn't some of that going on, but there's also some confirmation bias.
[01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:29.880]  Sure. We see it where it isn't as well as where it is. No, no, I hear you. And for folks
[01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:35.680]  that don't know about that particular term, why don't you define it for them? So confirmation
[01:24:35.680 --> 01:24:40.200]  bias is where you've already made up your mind that something's true. And then any evidence
[01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:45.840]  you see in your environment, whether it supports that fact or not, you imagine that it does.
[01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:50.400]  So if for imagine you've, you've decided that Trump is a racist, then if he talks about
[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:53.760]  something like border security, which really doesn't have anything to do with the race,
[01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:57.920]  it's just something you do with all your borders all the time, every country. Sovereignty.
[01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:01.840]  And then you just say to yourself, well, that's probably another example of him being a racist
[01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:05.600]  because I already decided to. Sure. No, they say he wants to put gay people in prison and
[01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:10.040]  ship blacks back to Africa. And it just, it's all totally made up. Yeah. That's as made
[01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:15.480]  up as it could be. But on the Clinton side, there's, there's clearly some coordination
[01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:22.520]  with the mainstream media, but probably a little bit, you know, over imagined as well.
[01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:28.440]  You know, two years ago, Congress legalized the CIA and being involved in domestic propaganda
[01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:33.520]  operations. They call it propaganda placement. Well, I coined that term, they call it behavior
[01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:41.000]  placement. And it's Congress ruled it was illegal 10 years ago, but and said, stop,
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:46.200]  you know, funding it, but it's only expanding. So I think there's deeper layers to this,
[01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:52.120]  but obviously this confirmation bias, famously, you think maybe you think the CIA is involved
[01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:57.160]  in trying to influence the election? Oh, absolutely here. I mean, they've had the former CIA directors
[01:25:57.160 --> 01:26:03.080]  and others come out and demonize Trump. We actually, I have the Washington Post on screen.
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:07.120]  US repeals propaganda ban spreads government made news to Americans. I mean, it's, it's
[01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:13.600]  full on. Well, the government made news is for which purpose? I mean, that doesn't necessarily
[01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:18.840]  mean it's two years ago, they operate, they authorized domestic side operations. It's
[01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:22.320]  a fact I've interviewed the police chiefs. Everybody dealt the force comes in with big
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:29.240]  bags of money, buys off the local, local mayor. It's all part of COG. For what messages?
[01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:34.800]  What, what just to be prepared during a collapse or civil emergency to go with the particular
[01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:39.160]  party in power. It's pre-preparation. Come to Nazi's in France about three years before
[01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:43.120]  they invaded. They had almost the whole general staff already paid off, ready to stand down.
[01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:46.880]  The Blitzkrieg really didn't do anything. The French just stood down. And that's a historical
[01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:50.400]  fact. It's just not widely, widely circulated. Okay.
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:55.520]  Oh, the British fought and then they got beaten and sent to Dunkirk and you know, had to have
[01:26:55.520 --> 01:27:03.800]  the famous naval flotilla escape. Do you think we're close to martial law and Obama trying
[01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:07.520]  to retain power? I don't think Obama's going to try to maintain power, but the, but the
[01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:12.520]  establishment power structure, like Goldman Sachs that actually installs leaders, presidents
[01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:17.400]  and prime ministers in Greece and Italy now at Davos, they've called for a move to technocracy
[01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:24.800]  and basically installing bank heads as presidents. You know, I think we ought to take a look
[01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:30.040]  at our, our system of government. Um, if you ask me, it's already changed in ways that
[01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:34.440]  the founders didn't play. Exactly. It's a soft martial law. Well, we, uh, I'm going
[01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:38.880]  a different direction here. I'm saying that, um, you know, we're a republic by design,
[01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:44.600]  but because of the internet, um, a good idea can bubble up from any individual. If it gets
[01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:49.000]  viral, then the mainstream media has to pay attention to it. And if they pay attention
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:52.560]  to it, there's a good chance it's going to become policy. So I would argue that we have
[01:27:52.560 --> 01:28:00.560]  to evolve into a something closer to a direct democracy accidentally. Maybe a direct democracy
[01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:05.320]  of multinational corporations voting with their campaign contributions, but no, but I think,
[01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:10.280]  I think Trump, um, signals the end of that model that you just described. Um, I agree
[01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:16.280]  with me. He wins. So the old model and by old, I mean sort of right now, you know, last
[01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:21.360]  year as old, um, was that the lobbyists and the big money people were doing everything
[01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:27.000]  and, and selling it to the public as, as they had something to do with the decisions. Uh,
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:31.920]  but now I think that's actually becoming true because the internet that you can make enough
[01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:36.720]  noise in the internet. Your argument can be good. I agree. There's a giant tsunami of
[01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:40.720]  awakening and human empowerment coming, but there isn't a totalitarian pushback to that.
[01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:44.960]  That's what I was getting at Scott Adams, really smart guy blog.dilbert.com. I hope
[01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:49.280]  you'll come back with us sometime in the future. Are you still predicting a landslide for Donald
[01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:55.800]  J. Trump? I am based on technique, not policies. And, uh, it looks like Clinton's not going
[01:28:55.800 --> 01:29:00.800]  to make it, uh, to the, to the end line. I'm based on what she looked like yesterday.
[01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:04.120]  So you mean, I don't think it's a conspiracy theory that she looks sick. Even Obama's former
[01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:09.480]  doctor, uh, who's a Democrat is saying she looks really bad. Well, there's a lot of variability
[01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:12.920]  in her appearance. And that's what I pointed out. I'm not trying to be a doctor. I'm just
[01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:18.800]  making sure she looks like hell. Uh, Scott Adams, one last question. Um, are you concerned
[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:22.120]  or have you heard Homeland security now is going to step in and run the election for
[01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:28.200]  the first time ever? What? I'm not kidding. Look it up. Homeland security is going to
[01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:32.040]  run the election. Yes, sir. And here's the deal. You have a normalcy bias because you're
[01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:35.720]  a good guy. You don't think as evil as these people do, even though you're sophisticated
[01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:40.320]  and smart. I'm asking you to see that confirmation bias that's even bigger because you're not
[01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:43.920]  a psychopath. I really appreciate your time, sir. I look forward to speaking to you again.
[01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:47.720]  All right. Thank you. Very informative guy. We'll be right back. Thought provoking. Stay
[01:29:47.720 --> 01:29:53.840]  with us. Huge news. Straight ahead. We're on the March. The empire's on the run. Alex
[01:29:53.840 --> 01:30:04.440]  Jones and the GCN radio network. Once again, Donald Trump has stepped into the vacuum left
[01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:08.840]  by Hillary and Obama as he quickly accepted an offer from the Mexican president to meet.
[01:30:08.840 --> 01:30:12.600]  He not only met with the Mexican president, but he took control of the press conference
[01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:17.440]  afterwards, infuriating Trump's media opponents like Spanish language channel anchor Orhei
[01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:23.380]  Ramos. Ramos inadvertently praised the leadership of Trump when he unleashed a string of tirades
[01:30:23.380 --> 01:30:28.480]  on Twitter in both English and Spanish, excoriating the Mexican president for looking passive even
[01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:33.080]  for agreeing with Trump that NAFTA could be improved. Meanwhile, Hillary hasn't held a
[01:30:33.080 --> 01:30:39.680]  press conference for 272 days since the beginning of December before any primaries. And we're
[01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:44.040]  now over 80% of the way through the election. Hillary could only carp from the sidelines
[01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:48.840]  as she did when Trump visited flood victims of Louisiana while she ignored them completely.
[01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:52.520]  Don't expect Hillary to talk to the Mexican president before the election because it would
[01:30:52.520 --> 01:30:55.720]  be followed by a press conference and she can't handle that.
[01:30:55.720 --> 01:31:21.680]  Right now, we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body
[01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:27.440]  that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading disease around.
[01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:31.840]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites. Tell us about all
[01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:35.000]  the stuff that said that there's so many things that are in it. You have the neem in there.
[01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:40.240]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood. I recommend doing a parasite cleanse
[01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:43.640]  at least twice a year. All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going
[01:31:43.640 --> 01:31:47.880]  back on it today. It just came back in yesterday, living defense, infowarslife.com. And folks,
[01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:52.480]  you can't lose. It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period. And you support
[01:31:52.480 --> 01:31:56.880]  the broadcast, infowarslife.com. Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[01:31:56.880 --> 01:32:00.200]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:06.600]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce
[01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:09.920]  about a group you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:13.360]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think
[01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:18.800]  it's very, very important. What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we
[01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:24.600]  lose a little bit of our telomeres. Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:29.680]  And when it runs out, you start dying. We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different
[01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:34.320]  clinical trials. It's one of the most effective substances in the world. It works like an
[01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:38.280]  antioxidant. It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[01:32:38.280 --> 01:32:42.560]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount. It's in powder form.
[01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:47.840]  We have so many five-star reviews. I take this. This is the product that I take.
[01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:52.120]  InfoWarsLife.com. In the profit we make, we fight the globalists. We fight the New World

[01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:17.720]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo. The era of economic surrender will finally
[01:33:17.720 --> 01:33:23.920]  be over. We will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of
[01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:28.000]  globalism. They have gotten the political establishment and the media establishment
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:36.000]  to become pure, wanton, henchmen of totalitarianism. If you were a foreign power, looking to weakened
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:42.240]  America, you couldn't do better than Hillary Clinton's economic agenda. I think what the
[01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:49.320]  Chinese have done is really smart. The skyscrapers went up in Beijing and many other cities around
[01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:56.800]  the world, while the factories and neighborhoods crumbled right here in Detroit. It's all training
[01:33:56.800 --> 01:34:01.960]  us to accept less, lowering expectations, a post-industrial world, a new dark age. That's
[01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:07.760]  what the UN Biological Diversity Assessment 1996 calls for. When we abandoned the policy
[01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:15.160]  of America first, we started rebuilding other countries instead of our own. Not a world
[01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:19.480]  Winston that gets more beautiful and more technological and stronger, a world that gets
[01:34:19.480 --> 01:34:26.480]  uglier and stupider and more stunting. That the government should allow Hillary Clinton
[01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:31.480]  to become president of the United States. I voted for Hillary Clinton. Well, I voted
[01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:35.760]  for Hillary. I guess I have to since I'm working for her as well. You want an image of the
[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:40.760]  future Winston? It's a boot stopping on a human face forever. Muslims are peaceful and
[01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:47.600]  tolerant people and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism. Women are treated, discriminated
[01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:52.920]  against in all these countries she took money against. Gays and lesbians are either executed
[01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:57.720]  or punished severely. They're mistreated. She claims to be their champion. Don't look
[01:34:57.720 --> 01:35:02.000]  at me Winston and see the black circles around my eyes and see how ugly and weak I am, expressing
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:06.520]  myself and dying. I torture people 18 hours a day and I have a horrible life. That's the
[01:35:06.520 --> 01:35:11.120]  beauty of the satanic evil of the priest of power ripping apart humanity. We're here to
[01:35:11.120 --> 01:35:17.520]  hurt humans. We're here to suck your guts out. We now take you live to the central Texas
[01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:29.240]  command center and the heart of the resistance. Laura Southern is probably one of the most
[01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:35.520]  censored people on a regular basis that I see. And the reason she is, she's eloquent,
[01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:43.520]  she's smart, she's attractive and she's aggressively in a friendly way going out and showing what
[01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:49.920]  horrible bullies social justice warriors are. There was a video that we heard a few days
[01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:54.440]  ago that she first brought to our attention others have reported on it as well. And that's
[01:35:54.440 --> 01:36:00.600]  important to note with this horrible woman who is a public figure of a feminist, runs
[01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:09.640]  feminist organization coming out and bullying for six minutes a poor taxi driver or lift
[01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:17.600]  driver. The video is on informers.com. If you missed it, it's actually hard to watch
[01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:26.360]  her voices like nails on the chalkboard. And the headline of the article is snake like
[01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:34.440]  bully harasses lift driver over hula girl. That's my headline. I had to change it. It
[01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:40.840]  was a social justice warrior flips out over hula girl. But I mean, really, it's just
[01:36:40.840 --> 01:36:45.720]  a snake like creature. And when you hear hissing voice and how ignorant she is and how entitled
[01:36:45.720 --> 01:36:50.840]  and then it is the definition you could teach a college course on psychology and projection
[01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:57.640]  on this lady, everything she's saying to the poor polite man who is incredibly professional
[01:36:57.640 --> 01:37:02.280]  the entire time. I'm sorry, I'd be get out of the car in about 30 seconds. You don't
[01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:08.680]  like the hula girl get out. That is my right to do. I don't like who's in my cab. And people
[01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:14.520]  need to stand up to these bullies. Now, they shut down our YouTube channel. I don't know
[01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:18.400]  if she's gotten it back yet, but they've shut her down on Twitter. She's been shut down
[01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:22.840]  for the mildest stuff. You know, you go out and show some so called feminists marching
[01:37:22.840 --> 01:37:26.400]  around acting like idiots screaming and yelling that, you know, men are all evil and all just
[01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:31.880]  shut your channel down. And don't worry, the YouTube diversity team, we have it on screen
[01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:38.520]  for TV viewers, sent a message back to the bully and said, Oh, yes, we looked at your
[01:37:38.520 --> 01:37:44.280]  video or we looked at Laura Southern's video and, you know, we've had her removed and then
[01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:52.960]  Annalise the bully shins Laura Southern a tweet and says bye-bye in French to your YouTube
[01:37:52.960 --> 01:38:00.720]  channel. You bully. Oh, I'm destroying your livelihood. I'm trying to cut you off reaching
[01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:04.720]  the people when you politely showed what a bully I am. And the bullies, the other social
[01:38:04.720 --> 01:38:07.600]  justice warriors that are going to manage things at YouTube, they agree. And now YouTube's
[01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:11.720]  come out today drudgerport.com or one right to Laura drudgerport.com. And I got to set
[01:38:11.720 --> 01:38:17.840]  this up has dead center. Our story that YouTube has announced new terms of service where their
[01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:22.320]  little social justice diversity team, if they don't like what your site says, they're going
[01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:25.240]  to demonetize you. They're still going to take the money. There's not going to give
[01:38:25.240 --> 01:38:31.080]  you your 30 40% or whatever. So this is how they're going to enforce it. And that's the
[01:38:31.080 --> 01:38:37.320]  Chinese model that they brought in with his social score. The BBC thinks it's a great
[01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:41.920]  idea and called it a social credit system that took over the internet and monitors everything
[01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:49.560]  you do and tracks you that alone is 1984. And then it basically puts you in electronic
[01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:54.080]  gulag and then they say in China, the next step is no job in the real world. So Laura
[01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:59.800]  Southern joins us. I appreciate her coming on. Simply amazing rebel dot media. Thanks
[01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:05.200]  for coming on. You are such an evil person. I am an evil person. Yeah, this morning you're
[01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:09.440]  talking about me getting censored. I'm now officially banned. I'm not sure if it's from
[01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:14.520]  Sky News in general, but Kay Burley's show for sure. I'm a evil racist, according to
[01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:19.280]  them. So that's just one other thing I'm banned from. Luckily, I still have my YouTube channel,
[01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:23.920]  but it's interesting that video was shared on a very large channel. Philip DeFranco,
[01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:28.920]  it got more video, more views than my video I uploaded did. And that's when they started.
[01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:32.520]  He's had a great relationship with YouTube for 10 years, been one of their first graders,
[01:39:32.520 --> 01:39:36.400]  biggest creators. As soon as he uploaded that video of Annalise saying she was a bad feminist
[01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:41.160]  that he never talks about the social justice stuff, quite like that. They started demonetizing
[01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:43.520]  all his stuff and they took down 12 of his videos.
[01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:46.600]  Okay, well, she was bragging she took you down for a while. I mean, was she even wrong
[01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:48.320]  about that? I know she tried.
[01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:53.800]  She was, she was wrong about that. What happened actually is Annalise deleted her account the
[01:39:53.800 --> 01:40:00.400]  night that I uploaded everything and someone stole her Twitter account and has been uploading
[01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:06.760]  a bunch of stuff under Annalise's name. Although Annalise has made a lot of attempts to destroy
[01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:11.240]  people's lives for sharing this video, she runs her feminist group in LA where she's
[01:40:11.240 --> 01:40:18.080]  kicked tons of people out. She's doxing anyone who questions her. She actually ran a, she
[01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:23.000]  pimped girls out. She runs like a kind of like sex ring and she's been revealing girls
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:28.920]  as working for her in the sex work for going against her and just destroying her life.
[01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:33.560]  And then she's claiming at the exact same time that she is a victim of all this horrible
[01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:39.120]  doxing and bullying when that is exactly what she wanted to happen to this Lyft driver.
[01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:44.080]  Ah, so she's out bullying and then finally bullies come and take over her channel and
[01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:48.240]  then basically continue acting like she's been acting. I tell you, Laura, I'm glad you
[01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:49.240]  can fill us in on this.
[01:40:49.240 --> 01:40:50.240]  Heart stop.
[01:40:50.240 --> 01:40:53.120]  Do you agree with my statement that this is just epic projection? Because people that
[01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:56.400]  have watched the video and heard it, she's bullying and bullying and threatening his
[01:40:56.400 --> 01:41:00.640]  job and just all over this poor guy and then cussing at him and then she's calling him
[01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:01.640]  a bully.
[01:41:01.640 --> 01:41:02.640]  Oh no.
[01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:11.640]  We may have had her Skype drop for a moment. Are you back?
[01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:12.640]  Just one minute.
[01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:17.720]  That's all right. We can interview you sideways. I think she's at college during during during
[01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:23.520]  the lunch break in an office. Hardworking lady, Laura Southern is our guest. Let's go ahead
[01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:27.840]  and play the clip while we're getting her Skype on. This is just a portion of the hula
[01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:28.840]  hula girl. Here it is.
[01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:35.880]  You know that was adorable. You didn't think about like the pillaging of the like continent
[01:41:35.880 --> 01:41:36.880]  of Hawaii.
[01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:37.880]  I didn't do another pillaging.
[01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:45.200]  Oh, you didn't? Okay. So you won't get rid of the doll then? Because that was like really
[01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:46.200]  cute thing when you find that goodwill.
[01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:55.200]  No, I'm not going to get rid of it because it's not. I just don't realize it was a bad
[01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:56.200]  thing.
[01:41:56.200 --> 01:42:00.200]  But so obviously like you as like a white male, you were like the least like.
[01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:02.200]  But now you're judging me or something wrong?
[01:42:02.200 --> 01:42:08.200]  No, I'm not. I'm not judging you. I'm just saying like that perhaps like you might be
[01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:14.360]  the person who has least heard in the situation. I'm a passenger in your car like that doll
[01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:19.360]  is offensive to me. But you don't want to take it down because you like found it a goodwill
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:22.360]  and it's fine.
[01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:29.880]  By the way, while we're getting her Skype back connected, it's a famous Texas thing.
[01:42:29.880 --> 01:42:37.000]  I don't know why we do it. We call the road Manchaka Manchak. Everyone in East Texas
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:42.360]  always called me Alec or Alec. They couldn't say Alex and I know her name is Lauren, not
[01:42:42.360 --> 01:42:47.080]  Laura, but I'm calling her Laura Southern. It's Lauren Southern. I got a lot of stuff
[01:42:47.080 --> 01:42:52.360]  going on in my brain though, obviously folks. And we're teleprompter free here. But I wanted
[01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:57.440]  to have her on to talk about this because look at all the censorship that's coming in.
[01:42:57.440 --> 01:43:03.160]  Look at the censorship that's intensifying. Look at the Trump guy who saved the baby
[01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:11.240]  in the hot car. And when they had him on seeing in or headline news, seeing in so mistrusted
[01:43:11.240 --> 01:43:16.520]  that they're trying to rebrand themselves the last five, six years, when they first
[01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:23.240]  had him on, it was live and it said Trump 2016. But the next time they reared it, it
[01:43:23.240 --> 01:43:28.480]  was gone. They had simply blurted out like you do in the Soviet Union. So they invite
[01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:32.080]  you on to get their ratings and then they disrespect you. Won't even let you have what's
[01:43:32.080 --> 01:43:35.840]  on your shirt. I mean, if somebody had something on a shirt that I didn't want, I'd be honest
[01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:38.560]  with them and say, change that shirt if it was like cuss words or something, but it's
[01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:44.080]  not. So you disrespect people and you disrespect your viewers because you're not going to let
[01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:53.680]  a hero be associated with Donald J. Trump. Simply par for the course and people say,
[01:43:53.680 --> 01:44:01.440]  well, this will wake everybody up. This has got a backfire on them. The problem is over
[01:44:01.440 --> 01:44:12.480]  time, we'll just get acclimated to accepting that. I want to transfer on this subject,
[01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:23.360]  play a clip that's comical from Trump that he knows is so funny. It'll be hard for them
[01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:26.680]  not to be able to air it because Trump's biggest problem is they won't play large clips of
[01:44:26.680 --> 01:44:30.720]  what he has to say now. They do that with Hillary, but she already comes out from under
[01:44:30.720 --> 01:44:36.840]  a rock to do that. But I love this clip where he says, maybe ice will deport Hillary Clinton.
[01:44:36.840 --> 01:44:41.320]  And he said this after he traveled to Mexico when he went to Arizona to give a speech there.
[01:44:41.320 --> 01:44:51.120]  And I have to tell you, I liked what Manafort was doing for the Trump campaign, helping
[01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:57.280]  him get some grassroots money, some organizations stop the steal at the primary level. That's
[01:44:57.280 --> 01:45:00.960]  what he was really an expert at. But Stephen Bannon, and I can tell you, other people
[01:45:00.960 --> 01:45:07.840]  close to Trump say this as well, is really responsive and is working 20 hours a day and
[01:45:07.840 --> 01:45:17.120]  doing an amazing, amazing job. And that comes from a lot of folks that have even been in
[01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:23.440]  other camps, but that just shows how they're in the Trump camp to win. So really good move
[01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:28.440]  there with Donald Trump to get somebody else in there that's just got the new media understanding
[01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:36.980]  because this is the future. And it's kind of like it's 1912 and Trump's opening a automobile
[01:45:36.980 --> 01:45:42.320]  manufacturing facility. Now, will he end up being the biggest like Henry Ford or is he
[01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:50.040]  launching too early? Or is he launching right on time? I mean, he believes people are ready
[01:45:50.040 --> 01:45:55.200]  to have nationalism and sovereignty and wealth and a program of wealth and independence.
[01:45:55.200 --> 01:46:00.000]  The globalists want us poor. They want to control us. They admit that. Looks like we
[01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:05.040]  lost Laura Southern's connection. Your computer may have died. So we're going to move on at
[01:46:05.040 --> 01:46:11.200]  that point. Let's go ahead and go to this clip. Maybe ICE will deport Hillary Clinton.
[01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:22.240]  We're going to triple the number of ICE deportation officers. Within ICE, I am going to create
[01:46:22.240 --> 01:46:30.880]  a new special deportation task force focused on identifying and quickly removing the most
[01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:38.280]  dangerous criminal illegal immigrants in America who have evaded justice just like Hillary
[01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:56.280]  Clinton has evaded justice, okay? Maybe they'll be able to deport her. That is presidential
[01:46:56.280 --> 01:47:05.840]  material right there. That's what a president looks like, acts like and does. Stamina, alpha
[01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:13.160]  male, successful, loves America, loves freedom, loves wealth for the general public, believes
[01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:21.280]  in a growing pie. Drinks, and Trump's never said it's not people that know him. He drinks
[01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:28.560]  gallons of milk a day, steaks, big things of vegetables, doesn't take aspirin, doesn't
[01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:36.000]  take vaccines, none of it. And they spun it like he's unhealthy because his doctor said,
[01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:39.160]  look, I could have wrote that letter better. When I write these for people, I write it
[01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:51.240]  real quick. But he is in really great shape for someone his age that exercises. I mean,
[01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:57.280]  he's as good a shape as you get at that age. I mean, look at Trump, he's 70. I mean, he's
[01:47:57.280 --> 01:48:02.880]  wearing body armor and so it looks like he's a little bit fatter than he is. He's not.
[01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:06.440]  But it doesn't matter. Just look at him compared to Hillary. I mean, this is ridiculous. This
[01:48:06.440 --> 01:48:11.800]  is hands down. I mean, if Hillary was like some libertarian or patriot woman and smart
[01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:19.880]  and, you know, I don't care if they're beautiful or not, great, give me a woman right now.
[01:48:19.880 --> 01:48:26.680]  This is really a joke. I mean, this is a gigantic joke and they're betting the farm on the fact
[01:48:26.680 --> 01:48:30.840]  that she's a woman and it's this gimmick and we got to do it. Now, I want to come back
[01:48:30.840 --> 01:48:35.720]  over this break with an extremely powerful clip of Julian Assange when he was being interviewed
[01:48:35.720 --> 01:48:40.200]  by the New York Times. And of course, the New York Times wrote an article about this
[01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:43.200]  and didn't, you know, get into any of these areas. And now they're calling him a cooke
[01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:49.680]  alone. He puts out leaks. He puts out real info. None of it's true. They got assassins
[01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:55.520]  trying to, you know, climb in the wind and killing over there at the embassy in London.
[01:48:55.520 --> 01:49:00.120]  This is amazing. And he says, this woman is a demon. Do you understand? And all I can
[01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:10.440]  tell Assange is too calculated a blow a lot of times misses. I would, I would start firing
[01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:17.320]  torpedoes every day. I would just Chinese water torture this and just drip, drip, drip,
[01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:27.200]  drip. But I wouldn't, I wouldn't save the best till last. I would say I would, I would, I would fire now.
[01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:36.080]  Now, like on a Tuesday morning, so that there's no way they can cover it up rather the weekend.
[01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:40.200]  And then to coordinate and say it's time to take down the demon and start your engines
[01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:44.080]  because he's like, well, the mainstream media picks this up. She, she'll have to go down.
[01:49:44.080 --> 01:49:48.520]  She's a criminal. They're not going to pick it up or they're going to spin it. You got
[01:49:48.520 --> 01:49:54.000]  Nancy Pelosi emails, you know, with her national security advisor to her going, yes, our policy
[01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:57.560]  ma'am is to back Al Qaeda and ISIS and they're taking over and that's what Hillary's doing.
[01:49:57.560 --> 01:50:00.880]  And because, you know, behind the closed doors, that's not what the policy is. I mean, hell,
[01:50:00.880 --> 01:50:06.880]  the CFR wrote articles three years ago saying we need Al Qaeda. They're, they're good.
[01:50:06.880 --> 01:50:12.960]  It's no secret, but the media spun it where was something about, you know, side issue
[01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:17.160]  about Pelosi, which is some little corner of the memo, not even about what it was about.
[01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:26.280]  There's this instinct to never go with the heart of what something is.
[01:50:26.280 --> 01:50:30.960]  I'm not going to sit here and belabor the products. We, we set out of the very best
[01:50:30.960 --> 01:50:36.800]  nutraceuticals, the vitamins, the minerals, the supplements that we can produce. And our
[01:50:36.800 --> 01:50:41.840]  new selenium that came out bio tricelenium is incredibly absorbable, absolutely amazing.
[01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:48.760]  And it's from the mustard seed. And just go research what selenium does folks. It's,
[01:50:48.760 --> 01:50:52.120]  it's a game changer. You need it. And we need the funds to run the operation. It's a 360

[01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:06.920]  Today I became a biophoton woman. I put a tablespoon of the Andreas 5 seat oil in my morning one
[01:52:06.920 --> 01:52:12.520]  world way drink and was still happy and energized at 3 p.m. Normally I feel tired and spacey
[01:52:12.520 --> 01:52:17.520]  at the end of the day. But today I felt energy and very clear. My friend at the farmers market
[01:52:17.520 --> 01:52:22.000]  asked what I was on. She says my eyes look bright and I had unusual energy for that time
[01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:26.880]  of afternoon. I told her there was a magical oil that enabled my body to absorb the sun's
[01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:32.240]  energy as if I were a plant. She said I want some. A second one world way shake with the
[01:52:32.240 --> 01:52:37.400]  oil when I got home took me to bed time with that wonderful abundant energy. I couldn't

[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:30.120]  By the way, we're not going to be able to fund this operation if I only plug 20 seconds
[01:54:30.120 --> 01:54:34.560]  each hour. Other shows plug every segment but then every few weeks I do like a 20 minute
[01:54:34.560 --> 01:54:38.840]  in commercial to try to fund this. All I can, we just do things different here and it's
[01:54:38.840 --> 01:54:44.560]  worked while the rest of the media is going bankrupt but I should just encourage everybody
[01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:48.160]  to buy the products. They really are good. History is happening with the Hillary for
[01:54:48.160 --> 01:54:52.480]  President shirt and whereas I'd like to sell them for $19.95 and be able to fund the operation
[01:54:52.480 --> 01:54:58.640]  I know that we sell 10 times more when I sell them at cost. So I'd rather lose the $10 and
[01:54:58.640 --> 01:55:05.920]  make no money and have these flood the streets and defeat Hillary but it is a catch 22. So
[01:55:05.920 --> 01:55:09.760]  I don't sit here and calculate stuff out. I just go with my gut and it always seems
[01:55:09.760 --> 01:55:14.000]  to work. God comes through but I told them because they couldn't figure out on the shopping
[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.240]  cart how to have an option where you could pay full price if you wanted to and I just
[01:55:16.240 --> 01:55:20.320]  said create another page with the same shirt under another code number at $19.95. Have they
[01:55:20.320 --> 01:55:25.120]  done that yet? Because I've been wanting this for months and some people want to pay full
[01:55:25.120 --> 01:55:31.800]  price and we need to create another page. Okay? People say why are you doing this on
[01:55:31.800 --> 01:55:37.000]  air? I have to direct on air. I have to work all the time. I have to actually do management
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:41.600]  here on air. It's what I do and it's like an office wide intercom I guess because I
[01:55:41.600 --> 01:55:47.200]  keep asking for that. Everybody's great. Nobody's bad but I really do need to get the funding.
[01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:52.400]  So we need to add the option for $19.95 and they keep saying but the shopping cart won't
[01:55:52.400 --> 01:55:56.640]  let us do that. It's like a spinal tap where they go why does it go to $11 because it makes
[01:55:56.640 --> 01:55:59.280]  it louder and go well just how about make it louder and just says $10 and he goes but
[01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:06.200]  it's $11. What I'm saying just like when I said 15 years ago we're going to stream live
[01:56:06.200 --> 01:56:11.400]  24 hours a day and not just have it archived and it took me a year to convince people
[01:56:11.400 --> 01:56:15.640]  to do that and you heard Drudge say last year it revolutionized because they then found
[01:56:15.640 --> 01:56:18.560]  in the algorithms people don't want to go hear something that's just canned. They want
[01:56:18.560 --> 01:56:26.600]  to jump into something even if it's not live it has the feeling of being live and I just
[01:56:26.600 --> 01:56:31.000]  knew if we're dominating at that time all these different you know shout cast and stuff
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:35.400]  was big then if we're number one when I'm live let's just be number one all the time
[01:56:35.400 --> 01:56:39.360]  by not ending and then we're always at the top and then we get all these new people
[01:56:39.360 --> 01:56:42.320]  that go to that service that was big at the time and then we get new listeners and then
[01:56:42.320 --> 01:56:50.240]  we defeat the new order. Anyways I said I go to the Assange clip but it's too epic to
[01:56:50.240 --> 01:56:54.680]  play right now I'm going to play it coming up it's on him for wars.com. In fact we should
[01:56:54.680 --> 01:56:58.760]  tweet this out again this is so big he doesn't just say she's a demon and going to put the
[01:56:58.760 --> 01:57:06.960]  presses heads and necks in nuisance. He goes over the demographics of how asinine it is
[01:57:06.960 --> 01:57:11.960]  to say that Russia is running him and that Russia is running Trump and that and of course
[01:57:11.960 --> 01:57:15.560]  Hillary says Russia is running me. I mean there have been hundreds of news articles
[01:57:15.560 --> 01:57:21.640]  folks unless you're saying I'm a Kremlin agent. The only thing Russian around here is Daria
[01:57:21.640 --> 01:57:27.240]  doing a fantastic job in there and she's a veteran of the US Army and a patriot. So let's
[01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:30.960]  get some more Russians in here I like them. The point is we're not run by the damn Russians
[01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:38.880]  okay. I'm run by my conscience. I don't want to splice babies with animals. I don't want
[01:57:38.880 --> 01:57:44.920]  to sell baby parts. I don't want deadly vaccines they admit on the insert can kill you becoming
[01:57:44.920 --> 01:57:49.960]  mandatory as California is now done. We're in deep crap people and I just try to straight
[01:57:49.960 --> 01:57:56.400]  talk everybody. But you know what let's have some comedy relief first. I did take off half
[01:57:56.400 --> 01:58:01.560]  a day yesterday I did go out with some friends on a boat. Tim Kennedy and some other folks
[01:58:01.560 --> 01:58:07.440]  from the military and Tim caught me actually supporting Hillary Clinton and this is what
[01:58:07.440 --> 01:58:12.200]  happened so we're gonna have some fun. I like Hillary Clinton you know that's where I support
[01:58:12.200 --> 01:58:25.080]  so Tim Kennedy I'm a sport Hillary right now. It didn't hurt when he did except he hit me
[01:58:25.080 --> 01:58:30.520]  and his hair slapped me like a whip actually had a mark from his hair hitting like pow but
[01:58:30.520 --> 01:58:35.920]  he took me down nicely so I wasn't wasn't hurt. And then there's a whole nother story
[01:58:35.920 --> 01:58:45.920]  I'm gonna tell you later. He oh my god it's ridiculous. This is GCN the Genesis Communications

[02:00:30.120 --> 02:00:34.360]  wanted to come visit us and Travis polite and met with him years ago. I've had our own
[02:00:34.360 --> 02:00:39.520]  government come visit with me and I've met with them and I've had. You know like police
[02:00:39.520 --> 02:00:43.520]  chiefs and stuff come in and they're just like you're not the only guy doing this are
[02:00:43.520 --> 02:00:50.640]  you. You've got to have something else that's behind us and no it's called resistance. It's
[02:00:50.640 --> 02:00:55.720]  called history it's called will it's called an incredible audience that aren't just spectators
[02:00:55.720 --> 02:01:01.800]  but are in the arena. The Patriots. You go to a Trump rally of every race color creed
[02:01:01.800 --> 02:01:09.880]  go getters not a piece of trash on the ground everybody polite nice smart informed. You go
[02:01:09.880 --> 02:01:19.960]  look at a Hillary event it looks like the living dead and just crazy people protesting
[02:01:19.960 --> 02:01:27.640]  and attacking just all fighting with each other. It just shows what we're up against
[02:01:27.640 --> 02:01:32.040]  is easily defeated if we just decided to take action against it. There are a lot of folks
[02:01:32.040 --> 02:01:36.920]  smarter than I am and I built the info war in 21 years and it's now changing the world
[02:01:36.920 --> 02:01:43.880]  because of you. Now Julian Assange very powerful interview he did with the New York Times where
[02:01:43.880 --> 02:01:47.400]  he just drops bombshell after bombshell first talks about demographics in Russia then he
[02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:51.960]  gets into Hillary who wants to put the presses neck in a noose and that's the point I'm at
[02:01:51.960 --> 02:01:56.360]  I mean everybody knows this. I mean that the creator of Gilbert endorsed Hillary because
[02:01:56.360 --> 02:02:00.080]  he was getting death threats we have now entered this authoritarian crucible and I'm not backing
[02:02:00.080 --> 02:02:05.560]  down. Here is part of Julian Assange most powerful interview yet. What we are drawing
[02:02:05.560 --> 02:02:14.440]  attention to is the amazing transformation of Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party
[02:02:14.440 --> 02:02:21.880]  into being the national security party and the national security candidate by whipping
[02:02:21.880 --> 02:02:30.480]  up a neo-McCarthy hysteria about Russia. I just any serious analyst understands that
[02:02:30.480 --> 02:02:36.840]  China and the United States are the only real games in town. China has 10 times the population
[02:02:36.840 --> 02:02:44.280]  of Russia 7 times the GDP. Russia has the GDP of Italy. It's interesting in that it
[02:02:44.280 --> 02:02:48.280]  wants to be you know that it makes provocative statements and so on. It's interesting and
[02:02:48.280 --> 02:02:56.040]  of course within its own neck of the woods countries in between Russia and China caucuses
[02:02:56.040 --> 02:03:02.760]  and so on of course Russia is very significant to them. But on the world stage Russia is
[02:03:02.760 --> 02:03:15.360]  a big player. Now that attempted reframing by Hillary Clinton to declare media organizations
[02:03:15.360 --> 02:03:23.720]  that are publishing material that shows illicit behavior in the DNC to fix the election for
[02:03:23.720 --> 02:03:32.320]  her as somehow us being Russian agents similar criticism has emerged from people connected
[02:03:32.320 --> 02:03:40.560]  to her campaign to the intercepts where Green World works. Her campaign has effectively called
[02:03:40.560 --> 02:03:47.240]  and maybe even directly called Donald Trump the opposition leader in this case a Russian
[02:03:47.240 --> 02:03:53.520]  agent Jill Stein the Greens party candidate effectively the fourth candidate in terms
[02:03:53.520 --> 02:04:01.160]  of numbers has been also been called a Russian agent. This is a neo McCarthyist hysteria.
[02:04:01.160 --> 02:04:08.920]  What kind of press environment is this going to lead to post election that the American
[02:04:08.920 --> 02:04:16.760]  press in American liberal press in falling over themselves to defend Hillary Clinton
[02:04:16.760 --> 02:04:22.560]  are erecting a demon that is going to put nooses around everyone's necks as soon as
[02:04:22.560 --> 02:04:27.920]  you win the election which he is almost certainly going to do.
[02:04:27.920 --> 02:04:31.560]  You know people would ask me if I like to signs going back eight nine years ago and
[02:04:31.560 --> 02:04:36.360]  I said yeah I see no fault in him and they all he's a you know left wing blah blah blah
[02:04:36.360 --> 02:04:41.840]  I said we'll see when Democrats get in what he does and then if he goes after them when
[02:04:41.840 --> 02:04:48.000]  they're bad we know he's a hero he is a hero and I'm different that is pure veritas what
[02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:53.920]  you heard the press climate they are coming out of the press like never before this is
[02:04:53.920 --> 02:05:00.360]  the stuff that dictatorships and authoritarian regimes are made of we're in danger.
[02:05:00.360 --> 02:05:04.200]  The House Oversight Committee Chairman and the House Judiciary Committee Chairman are
[02:05:04.200 --> 02:05:08.360]  both raising the issue of whether Hillary Clinton committed perjury when she testified
[02:05:08.360 --> 02:05:13.720]  under oath to Congress the discrepancies between what she said and what FBI director Comey said
[02:05:13.720 --> 02:05:18.440]  are obvious even to the casual observer but you may say because the Justice Department
[02:05:18.440 --> 02:05:22.960]  is so politicized they won't ever prosecute Hillary for crimes she commits and you're
[02:05:22.960 --> 02:05:27.160]  right but the President of Judicial Watch which has been at the forefront of investigating
[02:05:27.160 --> 02:05:31.560]  the corruption and the national security violations of Hillary Clinton points out in an interview
[02:05:31.560 --> 02:05:36.480]  with a Daily Mail quote one of the dirty little secrets in Washington is that Mrs. Clinton
[02:05:36.480 --> 02:05:41.640]  can be impeached now a federal official leaving office does not end congressional jurisdiction
[02:05:41.640 --> 02:05:46.720]  over impeachment for misconduct in that office and if Hillary was convicted by the Senate
[02:05:46.720 --> 02:05:52.000]  the sanction could be indefinitely for future office unquote well Congress grows fine and
[02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:56.320]  check the corruption if they don't do it in an election year they won't ever.
[02:05:56.320 --> 02:06:13.360]  I'm David Knight over the years there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the

[02:08:29.160 --> 02:08:36.060]  But I'm here to remind you of who we are. We're the sons and daughters of abolitionists
[02:08:41.760 --> 02:08:46.960]  Many women who gave their lives to fight against slavery
[02:08:52.060 --> 02:08:54.960]  But make no mistake about it slavery has returned
[02:08:54.960 --> 02:09:02.960]  And she is more vicious than ever before because this time she is color-blind
[02:09:06.960 --> 02:09:07.960]  31%
[02:09:10.560 --> 02:09:15.960]  31% of white Americans are welfare recipients
[02:09:15.960 --> 02:09:30.960]  33% of black Americans have fallen for the same rules and 28% of Latino community has believed the lie that the government can take care of you from the cradle to the grave
[02:09:35.960 --> 02:09:37.960]  All the while losing their humanity
[02:09:39.960 --> 02:09:41.960]  So when Trump talks about
[02:09:41.960 --> 02:09:47.960]  The lies of the Democrat Party has told
[02:09:49.960 --> 02:09:55.960]  And the failed policies both in economics education and crime
[02:09:57.960 --> 02:10:04.960]  Your heart should be stirred with passion and strength to do something about it
[02:10:04.960 --> 02:10:17.960]  That is R. W. Bray and out of all the clips from the Austin event that we were obviously there covering that clip I thought last week was the most powerful and his words are true
[02:10:18.960 --> 02:10:29.960]  They're strong, but it isn't even the eloquence. It's the force behind it. The way you delivered it was so heartfelt that I'm talking to folks that were there
[02:10:29.960 --> 02:10:42.960]  And my reporters they said that it really the energy in the room was so strong during that and this declaration was basically like Moses saying we're going to come out of this thing and then I started just thinking back about being a Republican family growing up
[02:10:42.960 --> 02:10:54.960]  And I never heard anything racist in fact I heard about bad things that people done how we had to build a free market economy to bring everybody up and then I would run into Democrats as I grew up and they would be so racist
[02:10:54.960 --> 02:11:08.960]  And I was like but the TV says it's the Democrats that are the anti racist and it's just and it wasn't a lot was like even 30 I've been on the air years before I even started even figuring it out because the deception is so total
[02:11:08.960 --> 02:11:20.960]  I can't blame some of the Democrats and people that still buy into this because I'm pretty smart guy and and I was fooled so I now once you're awake you're like what's wrong with these idiots but but it's just people don't know history and those that don't know history them to repeat it
[02:11:20.960 --> 02:11:30.960]  R.W. Bray I'm gonna go over his amazing military career and all the things he's done and he's the in engagement director of the Republican Party of Texas
[02:11:30.960 --> 02:11:41.960]  I'm not gonna go over at all R.W. Bray dot com Texas G.O.P. dot org and let's be clear I always want to be clear I'm not lionizing the Republican Party is a lot of horrible stuff and it's certainly been involved but that's different people
[02:11:41.960 --> 02:11:52.960]  But but the point is it's not the party that they've been saying is now I've invited you here and I'm ranting your over from Houston I want to get into this with you and I want to give you the floor the reason I'm so honored you just said you'd come in to see us
[02:11:52.960 --> 02:12:07.960]  So just on the phone is because I want to you know give folks not just five minutes of your speech but people to really let you take over if you want and kind of give us a sermon on your life your development what took you to this point because I think all of us are going through this process
[02:12:07.960 --> 02:12:15.960]  And but how do we accelerate that in others that have it thank you so much sir no thank you for having me really appreciate coming in so take over
[02:12:15.960 --> 02:12:27.960]  First let me tell you that my wife adores you she's a new fan ever since you all reached out she had never really saw it she started reaching out looking more at your clips and she she thinks that you're phenomenal
[02:12:27.960 --> 02:12:43.960]  Well I'm humble thank you thank you I don't know I think the story kind of is very simple the the speech actually was from from my heart I think that's the only way to be able to express from a black lens the importance of us
[02:12:43.960 --> 02:13:01.960]  Adopting republicanism and for me I'm actually a Louisiana originally consider myself a person who I evacuated from from Katrina I was in a guard at the time so I actually evacuated I had to run back actually I was called up to serve
[02:13:01.960 --> 02:13:19.960]  I was given the the order to to find 10 families in Houston where evacuated with me and bring them back even though I was in Baton Rouge so I actually had to drive to Houston find 10 families bring them back
[02:13:19.960 --> 02:13:37.960]  To Baton Rouge and then take the the mothers and the and the husbands who were actually guard members to serve so I did a month in search and rescue and three months of ICU and that's where my conversion starts unfortunately I didn't have the benefit of being raised in a Republican family I was raised a Democrat
[02:13:37.960 --> 02:13:53.960]  I didn't know your story but I think for all of us that's humanizing it how you get to the point of this powerful space that goes worldwide and wakes up so many people I just I just knew it would be very interesting yes it's a it's a story of itself but I'll give you a fast version of it
[02:13:53.960 --> 02:14:13.960]  I was taking a Black Hawk trip and as I was taking the Black Hawk trip we were actually looking for movement that was our goal we had to look for in life it was devastating and just devastation upon devastation I remember looking at the the east side of New Orleans and it was all great Alex everything was great
[02:14:13.960 --> 02:14:33.960]  so we gave up looking for life and and so we circled back around right in great water just great water great houses you know no heat and the flare nothing nothing was going on and and so we got to the to the river walk and I saw the pilot starting to cry and I look down and it's nothing
[02:14:33.960 --> 02:14:49.960]  but many women who look just like me and that's what I knew we had believed though a lie the government cannot take care of you it was droves of African Americans with their hands up in America looking for something to be dropped down I don't know the story but let me guess what color was the pilot
[02:14:49.960 --> 02:15:05.960]  white and my whole point is is that we're just all human beings that's right and the way they play on this and then even when the military goes out you know Obama said a few weeks ago about Louisiana again he said be sure don't be racist
[02:15:05.960 --> 02:15:19.960]  teams that are going in there I have family that was there as well who was active duty army but actually brought them in on that with the helicopters and they were there working 18 hours a day yeah I had family get really hurt there and I tell you it really pisses them off when they're not when they care about everybody
[02:15:19.960 --> 02:15:27.960]  they're being told they're racist even as they're saving people so I mean what I get from that is don't want to put words in your mouth or are you saying that was another big moment for you to see that
[02:15:27.960 --> 02:15:42.960]  yes that was a shocking moment for me and the the amazing thing is that we circled back around to the east side later on that day because we had to only you had to do footwork as well as air so we went through through the homes you know making the marks on the on the on the walls and
[02:15:42.960 --> 02:16:00.960]  were not in the rubbish of a of a house I found a book called up from slavery by Booker T Washington and so I took that book washed it off and I had a small little tent where area was and I at night I would read that book and it changed my life
[02:16:00.960 --> 02:16:16.960]  Booker T Washington was a entrepreneur and he was an educated at education advocate he started his his own university will be nose to ski airmen if it wasn't for for this guy will be no ski university wasn't for this guy but I saw his story
[02:16:16.960 --> 02:16:28.960]  literally from he went from dirt floors to marble and he gave one of the most powerful speeches the land of compromise I'd ever heard of my life and by the way I've got to know this history folks that don't
[02:16:28.960 --> 02:16:42.960]  and I'm not defending segregation was horrible but it was we replaced one evil than other he was his model and system that made black music many areas wealthier than white areas which created the institutional racism even more and and they started pushing
[02:16:42.960 --> 02:16:55.960]  massive class warfare between poor whites and poor blacks and that's when lbj and all them came in with we're gonna get them in out of the house we're gonna break these down because blacks just said okay you're gonna suppress us we're creating our own community
[02:16:55.960 --> 02:17:07.960]  that's right and and so they got rid of it I didn't even know this you knew all this because almost no one knows this I'm trying to explain to people wow that's amazing yeah so so if if if Americans period would do it Booker T Washington did
[02:17:07.960 --> 02:17:22.960]  well explain to people then yeah so Booker T Washington like I said advocate for education he could not get the like what I would call racist whites to invest at all into yourself so he did it himself and he went out he and he got investors from Republican investors
[02:17:22.960 --> 02:17:32.960]  which is exactly what I'm I'm advocating now I don't I don't like for us to go around making excuses but the racist the Republican party that found the KKK
[02:17:32.960 --> 02:17:46.960]  oh it's a Democrats I'm sorry yeah yeah I forgot about that those are the Democrats and it's amazing you I love the fact that you're you're knowledgeable of this history and I tried to give a brief history at the at the at the Trump rally
[02:17:46.960 --> 02:17:57.960]  and yeah my family in Texas my dad's had were Republicans and went through a lot of crap over I've never told the stories on areas over the top but you imagine these taxes being Republicans in the 40s and 50s and 60s it was not a very
[02:17:57.960 --> 02:18:08.960]  I can only imagine yeah I'm going man I'm a racist yeah we like you having me on the show exactly no but I mean it just shows how those that don't know history didn't repeat it the public period doesn't know history
[02:18:08.960 --> 02:18:20.960]  no please continue with your story and that was my conversion between that experience Katrina obviously in the book seeing a black man who had no it was unapologetic for being a Republican changed my entire life
[02:18:20.960 --> 02:18:30.960]  and my whole view of how I needed to advance my life it was then I realized I need to start getting active and usher's in why I'm now an advocate for the Republican Party of Texas I'm a proud advocate
[02:18:30.960 --> 02:18:46.960]  I would not have a night made changes then and and change my idea of what success was what knowledge was education was and how to run my political life I would have never had the opportunity to be able to give a speech at the Trump rally to ignite fire and millions of people but more importantly
[02:18:46.960 --> 02:18:52.960]  I'm on the show that touches millions because of you and we have a common we have a common heart
[02:18:52.960 --> 02:19:02.960]  well that's what Trump does is whether it's myself or you he gives a voice to other people that have important information and then he's helping magnify a whole new group of people
[02:19:02.960 --> 02:19:12.960]  that's right truly create real diversity of ideas and thought that's right really not have teleprompters but come together just get real there's our countries in trouble oh yeah and you have the energy of John Brown
[02:19:12.960 --> 02:19:26.960]  I love it because I'm not sure if your listeners know John Brown is but John Brown was good friends with Frederick Douglass is a powerful abolitionist powerful advocate who wanted to basically end slavery at all costs to the point he got a militia to do it
[02:19:26.960 --> 02:19:41.960]  he was going to overtake the entire government yeah but he wanted to white white races wanted to hang in this guy for even you know even trying to do this but I think I'll pay the guy they never hang you but I think the fire that you have is reminiscent of those days and I think that's what's coming
[02:19:41.960 --> 02:19:50.960]  and I think there's going to be a second reconstruction and I think it's going to happen through people get a galvanized and ignite a fire underneath their bellies to start doing something
[02:19:50.960 --> 02:20:00.960]  yeah the Democrats are playing total race card you want to write back to their KKK roots I mean I'm not just demonizing them they deserve it I mean Julian Assange is a real liberal he says Hillary Clinton is a demon

[02:33:01.960 --> 02:33:10.960]  oh
[02:33:10.960 --> 02:33:21.960]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[02:33:21.960 --> 02:33:49.960] .com
[02:33:49.960 --> 02:33:54.520]  Selenium that we just came out with it's from the mustard seed the best bioavailable form out there
[02:33:54.600 --> 02:34:00.120]  It's using all electrochemical activity in the body to get all the toxins out of the cells. You name it you die without it
[02:34:00.840 --> 02:34:03.340]  People are massively massive. I'm gonna take some right now
[02:34:04.440 --> 02:34:06.440]  massively
[02:34:06.760 --> 02:34:10.880]  Not getting enough selenium out there do your own research look into what selenium does
[02:34:12.720 --> 02:34:17.080]  Cancer rates you name it it is it is truly a game changer and it fuses with iodine
[02:34:17.080 --> 02:34:22.960]  But nobody's got the proper type of iodine. We have the only true nascent iodine from our research. That's out there
[02:34:23.560 --> 02:34:26.360]  That's from a deep earth source not from seaweed
[02:34:27.680 --> 02:34:32.480]  The stuff we have would eat through three layers of steel building like in the movie alien
[02:34:32.480 --> 02:34:37.120]  I mean, that's how powerful that the good halogen is but then through a special
[02:34:37.600 --> 02:34:42.560]  Patented Russian technique. I guess we are now Russian agents. I guess that's a Russian connection. The media's got it
[02:34:42.560 --> 02:34:47.000]  It is then injected into organic palm oil and then there's no longer
[02:34:47.720 --> 02:34:53.080]  Stuff that leads through steel girders and I'm just documenting for you how powerful this halogen is
[02:34:53.520 --> 02:34:58.000]  It's in the same family as fluoride chlorine all the garbage that just in a dates
[02:34:58.640 --> 02:35:03.400]  Our environment and you take selenium you take this you take enough vitamin C
[02:35:03.400 --> 02:35:06.080]  We don't sell that there's so many good sources of it out there naturally
[02:35:06.320 --> 02:35:10.040]  They all work in synergy, but if you don't have one of these you die and
[02:35:10.040 --> 02:35:13.600]  And deficiencies in it are just record level
[02:35:14.320 --> 02:35:20.260]  Record level your cells don't have this they start malfunctioning. They start mutating. We know there's a name for that

[02:35:35.960 --> 02:35:40.080]  A hundred thousand of these are already out there. It's already sitting shock waves
[02:35:40.080 --> 02:35:44.600]  It's all over the news constantly. It's one of the most searched terms this year on the internet and
[02:35:45.520 --> 02:35:50.640]  We started it you started it you bought the shirts you got them out there. You did the work. I had the idea
[02:35:51.200 --> 02:35:53.480]  But it all goes together like a horse and carriage
[02:35:53.800 --> 02:35:57.180]  And we have the support the info war you can click and get it for

[02:36:19.600 --> 02:36:25.160]  From our research again. This is the cause always say that because there might be something better out there if there is we're gonna we're gonna
[02:36:25.760 --> 02:36:29.480]  Go out and private label it. This is the best game changing
[02:36:29.480 --> 02:36:37.280]  Multi-vitamin mineral system for full absorption or the highest level absorption for you and your family just like our mythical bollum and secret 12 is
[02:36:37.680 --> 02:36:42.600]  Nutraceutical grade, you know pharmacy grade vitamin B12 is the same stuff people inject don't inject this
[02:36:42.600 --> 02:36:46.880]  It's for under the tongue. You want to inject it. It's even more absorbable. Go get it from a doctor
[02:36:47.040 --> 02:36:51.640]  But but but but minus that and let me tell you injectable from a doctor is like way up here
[02:36:51.880 --> 02:36:55.240]  Our stuff's down here, but everything else is way down here
[02:36:55.240 --> 02:36:59.920]  I mean you don't absorb basically any of a synthetic trash that's out there put it under your tongue hold it for a minute
[02:36:59.920 --> 02:37:03.400]  You're gonna get closer to an injection not as good
[02:37:04.040 --> 02:37:07.800]  It's gonna be honest with you, but it is a game changer. I sit around with top
[02:37:08.760 --> 02:37:13.320]  Scientists developers chemists and I say what are game changers missing links?
[02:37:13.360 --> 02:37:14.880]  There's a ton of them because most
[02:37:14.880 --> 02:37:20.600]  Nutraceutical companies will put ten dollars into marketing two dollars into what's in it and then sell it for a hundred bucks
[02:37:20.600 --> 02:37:27.000]  We don't do that. We have a hundred percent markup on average. The average is seven times the markup
[02:37:27.240 --> 02:37:33.280]  No, I'm gonna put quality in the bottle do a hundred percent markup funder operation. Have all the all the big
[02:37:34.480 --> 02:37:36.480]  Health sites go crazy over what we're doing
[02:37:36.520 --> 02:37:40.080]  Dominate the market and have all these people buying our products that aren't even listeners now
[02:37:40.080 --> 02:37:43.280]  But we're getting a lot of listeners for people getting the products because they're that good
[02:37:43.280 --> 02:37:49.320]  I went out and found the top three developers of Nutraceuticals in the country and I did deals with all three of them
[02:37:49.320 --> 02:37:54.960]  The group's just one of them. The others are too scared to come on here from big companies even bigger than group
[02:37:54.960 --> 02:37:56.200]  I mean some of these
[02:37:56.200 --> 02:38:00.960]  Companies are supplying like a third of the stuff a whole food just so you know and so that's why our stuff is so good
[02:38:00.960 --> 02:38:05.080]  And plus it's got to be bulletproof with the government coming after it's how they harass supplement makers
[02:38:05.520 --> 02:38:09.880]  I want to be great quality for everybody. I want you to come back. I want you to get a good deal
[02:38:09.880 --> 02:38:12.480]  I I want to be treated like I treat other people
[02:38:12.480 --> 02:38:19.920]  It's like revolutionary. No, that's what built America folks. All I'm doing is just like he did going back and reading history books
[02:38:20.640 --> 02:38:22.640]  By people that actually built this country
[02:38:23.280 --> 02:38:29.880]  Like Booker T. Washington and others it goes on and on and on and the innovation of hybrid crops in
[02:38:31.040 --> 02:38:32.520]  Modern
[02:38:32.520 --> 02:38:35.640]  Developments came from people that were oppressed in this country black Americans
[02:38:36.400 --> 02:38:40.920]  And again, I'm not pushing oppression. The point is open oppression makes you stronger
[02:38:40.920 --> 02:38:42.560]  You should smash it
[02:38:42.560 --> 02:38:47.360]  But what we're being killed by is all this large s how easy everything's gotten and they're not being aware now
[02:38:47.360 --> 02:38:48.560]  I want to take phone calls
[02:38:48.560 --> 02:38:54.120]  800 25 9 9 2 3 1 800 2 5 9 9 2 3 1 R. W. Bray
[02:38:54.640 --> 02:38:59.800]  R. W. Bray.com. He is the black engagement director of the Republican Party of Texas
[02:39:00.040 --> 02:39:05.960]  He's a military veteran and a patriot and we appreciate him being he's currently a master sergeant serving his first
[02:39:06.480 --> 02:39:09.680]  Sergeant guardsman and proud veterans advocate in Houston, Texas
[02:39:09.680 --> 02:39:15.160]  And a lot of other community stuff for children. You name it the MLK Association Vice Chair of Texas
[02:39:15.160 --> 02:39:21.080]  I'm gonna stop right there. That's another thing MLK a Republican. It goes on and on but but but give us your greatest hits
[02:39:21.080 --> 02:39:25.000]  I mean, you know, I mean what what what's really powerful what folks need to know, sir
[02:39:25.360 --> 02:39:29.760]  And and what Trump needs to do to win what we need to do to win
[02:39:31.040 --> 02:39:37.200]  Strategically, I think Trump needs to make sure that he he has advocates and surrogates in in these in North Carolina
[02:39:37.200 --> 02:39:39.200]  Wisconsin PA
[02:39:40.520 --> 02:39:45.840]  Michigan reason wise because number one, that's the Rust Belt number two places like Ohio
[02:39:45.960 --> 02:39:53.120]  We have a significant black population who are waiting for an answer. Yeah, they're their neighborhoods are being torn apart
[02:39:53.760 --> 02:39:55.760]  By bitter rivalries
[02:39:55.920 --> 02:40:01.160]  Whether that's through gangs or whether that's just a simple fact that people are living in poverty or fed up and they are
[02:40:01.600 --> 02:40:06.400]  Overreacting and reacting by killing their own that is the consequence of the Democrat League. Think about this Alex
[02:40:06.400 --> 02:40:10.920]  50 council members in Chicago 49 of which are Democrat
[02:40:12.080 --> 02:40:19.440]  One Republican and you look across the nation wherever there's Democrats in lead I mean leadership leadership
[02:40:19.440 --> 02:40:23.880]  There is a failing municipality and that's because there are some audiology. It's their satanic. I
[02:40:24.600 --> 02:40:26.400]  Would agree. Sorry. I agree
[02:40:26.400 --> 02:40:31.840]  But there are some ideologies that work and there's some that don't the thing about Republican ideologies that they are timeless
[02:40:31.840 --> 02:40:36.960]  Traditional they've always worked. They always will provide it. We remember and the fact that a matter of fact
[02:40:36.960 --> 02:40:43.760]  There is that humans often have a bad habit of losing memory. I agree those don't know history didn't repeat a place
[02:40:43.760 --> 02:40:49.760]  Continue. Yeah, well one of ways that we're jabbing at this thing and I got it. I got to say this
[02:40:49.760 --> 02:40:54.720]  I really love your Hillary shirt. I have good friend of mine called Maniola came into the Trump battle with me
[02:40:54.720 --> 02:40:58.160]  We almost got kicked out because they didn't read the thing but when they find
[02:40:58.160 --> 02:41:05.680]  No, it's a great conversation starter exactly. Yeah, yeah, they finally read it and it allows them to come in but but I think that
[02:41:06.760 --> 02:41:09.720]  Agitating the current status quo
[02:41:10.360 --> 02:41:14.360]  Like your shirt it agitates people we need to continue to agitate people verbally though
[02:41:14.360 --> 02:41:17.440]  And that's the problem. They're on a block that aren't enough black surrogates
[02:41:17.440 --> 02:41:21.240]  And Trump Trump wants to make a make a dent. Well exactly with the fact
[02:41:21.480 --> 02:41:24.680]  That shows us sophisticated York is I barely even realize it when I did it
[02:41:24.680 --> 02:41:30.440]  I just I always have the idea and then I see the thing behind it letters like my brain just knows I wanted it to cause debates
[02:41:30.440 --> 02:41:36.680]  That's right cause discussions. That's right and say Hillary for prison. That's our campaign. Yes, and then it's really caught on
[02:41:36.680 --> 02:41:38.960]  But please continue. Well, that's what Frederick Douglass stood for
[02:41:38.960 --> 02:41:42.920]  Frederick Douglass the very first father of civil rights movement stood for three things
[02:41:43.040 --> 02:41:49.480]  You see the number one if you study stuff for economic independence number two social collaborate social and business collaboration
[02:41:49.480 --> 02:41:54.640]  Collaboration collaboration and number let's put a friend of Frederick Douglass on screen that guy
[02:41:54.640 --> 02:42:00.400]  He'd be a movie star today. I'm that guy just looks so cool. Yes. Yes, and number three his last one was
[02:42:01.120 --> 02:42:02.360]  agitation
[02:42:02.360 --> 02:42:10.000]  Agitation one the last things that he said in his last speech a young black man at a university ask him as a young black man
[02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:15.480]  What should I be doing? He says agitate agitate agitate and what I see in them for wars
[02:42:15.480 --> 02:42:21.960]  I see in people like Trump and yourself and others that come across the nation is that we are ready political agitation has moved the needle
[02:42:21.960 --> 02:42:25.840]  Yeah, what you're saying is we're not trying to play in the corrupt system. We're changing it
[02:42:25.840 --> 02:42:29.480]  We're not trying to play by their rules and go along with it. We're we're we're
[02:42:30.040 --> 02:42:33.240]  Expanding the entire paradigm. That's right. And what better place to start than Texas?
[02:42:33.280 --> 02:42:37.160]  The RPT is doing in powerful things. We're going to areas that know the state is going
[02:42:37.160 --> 02:42:42.820]  We're getting calls that know the state is calling and when you think about that they rewrote Ron Paul's district over and over again
[02:42:42.820 --> 02:42:48.040]  They kept rewriting it for Democrats in black areas thinking and then he won by even bigger land
[02:42:49.040 --> 02:42:51.560]  That's right because he people go meet him
[02:42:51.560 --> 02:42:54.160]  He's just a sweet loving doctor that had been like, you know
[02:42:54.760 --> 02:42:59.000]  Volunteering three days a week for decades. Yes at poor hospitals. That's right
[02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:03.880]  And this is a guy who literally like would volunteer two three days a week at poor hospitals
[02:43:03.880 --> 02:43:08.760]  That's right because he but for no money. That's right because he believed it and of course he's racist Ron Paul though
[02:43:08.760 --> 02:43:14.440]  Well, well, most people believe that common sense isn't common these days, but the truth is that is it is people know common sense
[02:43:14.440 --> 02:43:17.880]  When they see it they see earnestness. They see a man with a with the correct heart
[02:43:17.880 --> 02:43:22.040]  They see him one person who has passion and they will gravitate toward it if Trump
[02:43:22.560 --> 02:43:30.040]  Continues to make sure that he goes into these black neighborhoods regardless of whatever the media is saying continue to go because I'm in those
[02:43:30.040 --> 02:43:36.160]  Black neighborhoods been doing it. Yeah, and they like it. They like the fact that finally someone is coming into those neighborhoods and talking
[02:43:36.160 --> 02:43:39.160]  And that's how we're gonna meanwhile Obama
[02:43:40.840 --> 02:43:46.560]  Vacations like a hundred days a year. It doesn't even care about Louisiana and gets away with it
[02:43:46.560 --> 02:43:49.640]  I mean, I'm not defending Bush. He had some problems big time, but he okay
[02:43:49.640 --> 02:43:54.520]  Some problems with Katrina response at least he responded. They don't even show up. Hillary doesn't even care. It's like
[02:43:54.840 --> 02:43:59.800]  Well, I had a I had a show on lifting the veil until the liberals got mad
[02:44:00.080 --> 02:44:02.800]  It was in it was in Houston and they killed this show
[02:44:02.800 --> 02:44:07.960]  It was called lifting the veil off a book is he Washington wasn't already over over. Yeah, they they they kill shows
[02:44:07.960 --> 02:44:10.280]  Oh, yeah, we have knocked off all the time. They'll come and say
[02:44:11.120 --> 02:44:13.800]  $300,000 take him off. Yeah. Yeah, they're good at it
[02:44:13.800 --> 02:44:21.160]  But one thing that one thing that really I touched on was that if Obama really really care for African-Americans are the current administration period
[02:44:21.280 --> 02:44:24.720]  We had one opportunity to get a Supreme Court judge and
[02:44:25.680 --> 02:44:32.400]  Latino was appointed we had another one and the LGBT was appointed his even his third choice that he tried to come was not a black person
[02:44:32.400 --> 02:44:37.520]  So a lot of you in a black neighborhood are starting to see that this guy never was gonna make our lives better
[02:44:37.520 --> 02:44:42.400]  And the truth is that you can't depend on the government to make your life better only you can do that plus
[02:44:42.880 --> 02:44:48.360]  To use the analogy and it's being pimped already got you. I don't need you. Yeah, that's right. I mean you say
[02:44:48.880 --> 02:44:53.780]  Boom, it's it's a given. It's about time that we start listening to our ancestors
[02:44:54.480 --> 02:44:57.560]  X talked about not trusting liberals one of the greatest quotes
[02:44:57.560 --> 02:45:01.720]  He ever said was keep in mind that a Dixie Krat is nothing more than a Democrat in disguise
[02:45:01.720 --> 02:45:07.480]  He talked about the fact that one party we had been invested in has abandoned us
[02:45:07.480 --> 02:45:10.600]  There was a racist from the beginning and it will always be racist MLK
[02:45:10.960 --> 02:45:14.800]  Warned us of the the of not looking judging men by his color and ice content
[02:45:14.800 --> 02:45:18.360]  You got blacks who won't join the Republican Party simply because there's a lot a lot of white people in it
[02:45:18.360 --> 02:45:20.360]  and let's explain it creates a
[02:45:20.800 --> 02:45:24.840]  Self-fulfilling prophecy where they say the Tea Party's racist and so then
[02:45:25.720 --> 02:45:28.040]  minorities or majorities in this area don't go and
[02:45:28.040 --> 02:45:32.440]  And what the real racism is the media pushing that but then what's happening on the Trump phenomenon
[02:45:32.440 --> 02:45:34.440]  I want you speak to this because it's documented
[02:45:34.800 --> 02:45:40.160]  Black Americans Hispanic Americans others are going and they're absolutely being appreciated by everybody and they're like wow
[02:45:40.320 --> 02:45:45.880]  This is incredible and people are coming together. It's very cathartic. I see people crying. That's right. I mean, this is crazy
[02:45:46.280 --> 02:45:53.480]  So again, they create the perception which makes it the reality. Oh, yeah, we have modern-day abolitionists right now people who brave
[02:45:53.480 --> 02:45:59.320]  People of different colors going to those neighborhoods saying come on me to this come me to see Hillary's America
[02:45:59.320 --> 02:46:03.400]  Come with me to watch this and and they're learning that there was a there's a black woman
[02:46:03.400 --> 02:46:07.240]  Who's at the Trump rally who was brought by two white friends and she was right up front?
[02:46:07.240 --> 02:46:10.680]  I thought that was amazing. So there there are modern-day abolitionists were more importantly
[02:46:10.680 --> 02:46:13.480]  I believe this is the rebirth of a second reconstruction
[02:46:13.480 --> 02:46:19.200]  W. E. Du Bois even said that he wished that the reconstruction had last reconstruction had finished its mark
[02:46:19.200 --> 02:46:24.880]  It never finished what it was supposed to do now it has an opportunity to do that Republicans need to wake up and know
[02:46:24.880 --> 02:46:30.080]  I got hijacked by a lot of corruption when Lincoln got killed. Well, obviously. Yeah, you you cut off the head of the snake, right?
[02:46:30.080 --> 02:46:31.000]  Yeah
[02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:35.880]  All I know is I don't know how Trump gets blamed for being on the KKK when 20 years ago and 10 years ago
[02:46:36.040 --> 02:46:42.440]  He's by himself. He decried David Duke and and then meanwhile Hillary's like kissing all over Robert Byrd
[02:46:42.440 --> 02:46:46.960]  You know the KKK wizard. I mean, it's just you can't make this up. I mean, it's just
[02:46:46.960 --> 02:46:50.760]  No, and I think another thing is to add something to it
[02:46:50.760 --> 02:46:54.720]  The black community is finally woke up to a Margaret Sanger in her lies, you know
[02:46:54.720 --> 02:47:01.760]  We we we have a population that is declining in the black neighborhood when you consider a hundred hundred and twenty years ago
[02:47:01.920 --> 02:47:06.160]  Black population made of 30. We're at 12 to 13 percent now. So over a century and a half
[02:47:06.440 --> 02:47:13.360]  We only make up 13. Oh, I know that's the fundamental where I'm told you're racist because you don't want black lives matter in George Soros
[02:47:13.360 --> 02:47:17.440]  I'm trying to turn black people into racists show that there was a big study out last week
[02:47:17.440 --> 02:47:19.680]  I meant to cover I didn't get into it major University study
[02:47:19.680 --> 02:47:26.000]  You can just pull it up diversity programs actually make things less diverse and hurt minority communities. Absolutely
[02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:32.240]  Yes, you turn Hispanics and black people into basically KKK versions for minority groups hopping up and down
[02:47:32.720 --> 02:47:38.480]  Truly real progressive business owners. Okay, what color they are don't want trouble and they're just all of a sudden
[02:47:38.480 --> 02:47:41.720]  They're not racist. They're scared and people are look like chips
[02:47:41.720 --> 02:47:44.200]  I mean the worst thing about spoiled kids and then we've all got them
[02:47:44.440 --> 02:47:47.960]  You know nowadays in the society is that they always think there's a chip on their shoulder
[02:47:47.960 --> 02:47:51.560]  And you did something to them and that's part of maternity is getting past having a chip on your shoulder
[02:47:51.800 --> 02:47:56.760]  And they're just trying to install chips on people's shoulders. Yes, like it's a degree or something
[02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:59.000]  When all of this is an anchor around your neck
[02:47:59.400 --> 02:48:07.480]  It speaking of anchors the the anchor institutions black anchor institutions like NAACP are now fighting against charter schools and academies
[02:48:07.480 --> 02:48:13.000]  Um, P. Diddy actually just created a charter school in New York. The NAACP is going to be trying to fight to kill it
[02:48:13.560 --> 02:48:19.080]  Nationwide it is now mandated and good for P. Diddy. Yeah, I'm gonna help people to want to go out of this hell
[02:48:19.080 --> 02:48:23.080]  They exactly know exactly and and if they don't know how to teach our children
[02:48:23.320 --> 02:48:30.200]  Then why not get a retired superintendent retired teachers in the area and create a charter school and teach those kids in a way
[02:48:30.200 --> 02:48:34.520]  That the liberal whites are failing. Why is that bad? The truth is that not that party
[02:48:34.520 --> 02:48:41.160]  The Democrat party wants to corral African Americans and minorities into one area so they can control them. Absolutely
[02:48:41.160 --> 02:48:45.400]  I want to go to Tony and Carl and Mike and Alex and David others
[02:48:45.400 --> 02:48:49.000]  We only got five minutes in the next segment and then five minutes more before the next hour starts
[02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:51.480]  And who do we have taken over today in the fourth hour?
[02:48:51.960 --> 02:48:56.600]  David Knight will always be doing a great job so much to cover. They're launching massive censorship initiatives
[02:48:57.000 --> 02:48:59.160]  That drudges is is covering drudges 4.com
[02:48:59.160 --> 02:49:05.400]  Uh, YouTube's new terms of service. It says if you're a you know, as you're extremist, we're going to take your monetization away
[02:49:05.640 --> 02:49:12.440]  That is that's economic gulags. Okay. That is that's what Hitler and the ghettos. I mean, this this is this is a major move
[02:49:12.680 --> 02:49:17.080]  It's the Chinese social credit model and drudges covering all that
[02:49:17.720 --> 02:49:19.480]  Paul Watson's article
[02:49:19.480 --> 02:49:21.320]  But let's take a phone call before we go to break
[02:49:21.320 --> 02:49:25.880]  In fact, I just can't help it. I'm gonna skip this this network break even though it costs us like $5,000. I'm doing it
[02:49:26.040 --> 02:49:28.040]  Because I need to just have more time here
[02:49:28.040 --> 02:49:34.760]  Uh, so callers realize that uh, let's go ahead and uh talk to Tony says he's an NBC whistleblower
[02:49:34.840 --> 02:49:38.440]  I was calling for whistleblowers a few days ago and some called in to talk about the atmosphere
[02:49:38.760 --> 02:49:40.760]  with with this unified press environment
[02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:45.720]  Which is sans is just like this is like totalitarianism. This is the unified bs
[02:49:46.360 --> 02:49:49.160]  Really shameful quite frankly and frightening. Uh, Tony go ahead
[02:49:50.360 --> 02:49:53.240]  Hey, thank you. Alex been a long listener. Um, it's about
[02:49:54.280 --> 02:49:56.280]  It's about 2009
[02:49:56.280 --> 02:50:00.360]  And you know back since 9 11. I started to realize that something wasn't right
[02:50:01.080 --> 02:50:04.680]  So I've seen the documentary. What was it called the loose change and
[02:50:05.320 --> 02:50:07.880]  I started to see things and as I worked in the news
[02:50:08.840 --> 02:50:12.040]  You know, I just felt like a lot of these stories weren't even both sides
[02:50:12.120 --> 02:50:14.760]  So as I became producer on a weekend newscast
[02:50:15.720 --> 02:50:17.560]  and the anchor
[02:50:17.560 --> 02:50:22.120]  You know, I started adding little bits to the story and giving my sources and then we had high ratings
[02:50:22.200 --> 02:50:24.840]  I mean, it was incredible to the point where they didn't know why
[02:50:24.840 --> 02:50:30.760]  So the viewers started emailing in and then they were like, you know, he's got this information
[02:50:30.760 --> 02:50:37.000]  So I get called in in the office and they say hey, uh, you need to stop putting this stuff into the stories because uh
[02:50:38.040 --> 02:50:40.840]  You know, it's not approved by NBC and I'm like, well
[02:50:41.880 --> 02:50:46.120]  It's you know, we have to share both sides of the story. So I think it's good journalism
[02:50:46.120 --> 02:50:47.720]  It's not what we study
[02:50:47.720 --> 02:50:50.920]  So like none of no, it's coming from NBC. You just put it in the way it is
[02:50:51.480 --> 02:50:53.080]  Don't change it
[02:50:53.080 --> 02:50:57.320]  And I said, okay. I said, uh, but you know, we're gonna lose ratings. I mean, you need to look at that
[02:50:57.320 --> 02:50:59.320]  I mean people love this information
[02:50:59.480 --> 02:51:01.480]  Look, you're just being told don't do it
[02:51:02.440 --> 02:51:05.960]  All right, absolutely. Absolutely. I mean, I want to hear the rest of your story, but for folks that don't know
[02:51:06.920 --> 02:51:10.760]  Local so-called news and and I want to change this while we're launching a tv system
[02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:13.400]  I've been so busy fighting other fights. I haven't quite got that launch yet
[02:51:13.400 --> 02:51:17.240]  But but but it's happening folks and then always, you know, good times seems to be in God's plan
[02:51:17.800 --> 02:51:18.680]  but
[02:51:18.680 --> 02:51:20.280]  Everybody should just put out their own news
[02:51:20.280 --> 02:51:24.520]  It's inexpensive now to do it compared to what it was so that stations UHF VHF
[02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:31.480]  Cable have a choice and don't just spew because it comes down in talking points. They love the teleprompter
[02:51:31.640 --> 02:51:34.840]  It looks like your local trusted news person. There's more trusted than national
[02:51:35.560 --> 02:51:38.520]  Let's say 50 trusted local versus six percent national
[02:51:38.920 --> 02:51:44.280]  But really your local person is really a national repeater. And so you're you're you're witnessing people want
[02:51:45.080 --> 02:51:47.080]  Both sides or three or four sides
[02:51:47.080 --> 02:51:51.640]  They want it it makes your ratings go up, but the media is still willing to kill itself
[02:51:52.040 --> 02:51:56.280]  To be able to maintain the political control because they're not in the business of making money at the news level
[02:51:56.440 --> 02:52:03.880]  They're in the business of making money for the larger global agenda and massive trillion-dollar banker bailouts, but finish the rest of story. I apologize
[02:52:04.920 --> 02:52:09.400]  That's okay. Uh, no, and then, you know, the funny thing is is I heard one of your other callers
[02:52:09.560 --> 02:52:12.840]  Yesterday talking about, you know, you're trying to bring stories to the newsroom
[02:52:12.840 --> 02:52:17.640]  You know people just, you know, they look at you like you're crazy. Like, you know, you're one of those nuts
[02:52:18.200 --> 02:52:23.080]  And I said, no, I said, look here's information. Here's documentation. This is important stuff
[02:52:23.400 --> 02:52:28.760]  So they're like and you get labeled so then you're kind of labeled in the newsroom. You're kind of an outcast
[02:52:29.320 --> 02:52:31.240]  So they thought the best way to
[02:52:31.240 --> 02:52:36.760]  You know help me not put out the message was to put me on a morning show and make it fun. Yeah, he's got a good personality
[02:52:36.760 --> 02:52:39.880]  You know, sir, that's a handbook when they walked in and shamrock communications
[02:52:39.880 --> 02:52:45.720]  I have the number one show in talk radio period at austin after three years on air. I'm 25 years old
[02:52:46.120 --> 02:52:49.880]  I'm making them tons of money and they said you're going to do an entertainment show now
[02:52:51.560 --> 02:52:54.760]  In the morning or we're going to fire you and I said I can't stop us six weeks later
[02:52:54.760 --> 02:52:58.360]  They fired me with pleasure and they said because you're talking about about bill clinton
[02:52:58.680 --> 02:53:00.680]  Now I'd already started my other shows. It didn't matter
[02:53:01.080 --> 02:53:07.480]  But I have experience where you're going to do entertainment now, buddy. Do you understand or next you're fired? Please continue
[02:53:07.480 --> 02:53:14.600]  So so then it was right around the time the nd double a was signed and it was in the newscast, which I didn't produce
[02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:19.240]  You know, I could only add the the promos and the teases and
[02:53:19.800 --> 02:53:25.080]  And then uh, you know, I figured well since I can't really put it in the script. Well, here's an opportunity
[02:53:25.080 --> 02:53:26.600]  We're going to go to a two-shot
[02:53:26.600 --> 02:53:31.400]  They go to the two shots. Hey, you know, um, a lot of folks don't really know what that stands for
[02:53:31.720 --> 02:53:35.160]  What those acronyms mean and then I explained a little bit about it
[02:53:35.160 --> 02:53:38.040]  And then she just kind of looked at me my co-worker and just
[02:53:38.520 --> 02:53:42.520]  I don't know. You're getting information. I'm like, well, it's out there. Here's a copy of that
[02:53:42.520 --> 02:53:45.720]  That's how brainwash. They don't even want you to say national defense authorization act
[02:53:46.280 --> 02:53:52.360]  Like like having info is now like evil. Oh, oh, he's informed. You're not allowed to NBC from New York
[02:53:52.600 --> 02:53:57.000]  Sins it and we just say he's talking on his own. We can't have that
[02:53:57.480 --> 02:54:02.600]  See it's programming folks teleprompters down to us. That's right. And when Trump
[02:54:02.600 --> 02:54:06.680]  You know is forced to use one because it's his actual speech. That's fine. But when he's attacking and he's saying, look
[02:54:06.920 --> 02:54:09.240]  It's script written. It's coming down to them
[02:54:10.040 --> 02:54:12.840]  So so so let me guess what happened next?
[02:54:13.880 --> 02:54:19.240]  Well, you know, I just uh, I was no longer in the circle and I was kind of an outcast
[02:54:20.200 --> 02:54:24.840]  And uh, I could just feel the pressure from beneath me because when you make your way to that position
[02:54:24.840 --> 02:54:29.480]  There's everybody on the bottom just gunning it just to put you out or to get you off
[02:54:29.480 --> 02:54:35.640]  So, uh, no longer invited to the parties and uh, you know, I'd leave the newsroom and I'd come back
[02:54:35.640 --> 02:54:39.640]  First they ostranize then they dehumanize you because they don't want to actually fire their friend
[02:54:39.640 --> 02:54:42.520]  They have to learn to hate you first because they're they're cowards number one
[02:54:43.080 --> 02:54:45.080]  So so how did it end?
[02:54:45.640 --> 02:54:50.200]  Well, it was about uh, just you know, a couple of months into my second year. They decided
[02:54:50.760 --> 02:54:54.760]  To let me go. I was I was kind of having some health issues. So I went to the doctor
[02:54:55.240 --> 02:54:59.080]  And uh, you know, I was like, oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry
[02:54:59.080 --> 02:55:03.480]  And uh, you know, I almost passed out so they were giving me checks and everything. They said, look, don't go to work
[02:55:04.200 --> 02:55:07.160]  And they figured well, maybe the morning show isn't for you. It's too early
[02:55:07.880 --> 02:55:13.960]  So I presented that to my bosses and they they delayed me coming back and then before you know, and I get a letter saying I'm gone
[02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:18.520]  And uh, you know, there's like 30 reasons why you could be let go
[02:55:19.320 --> 02:55:23.880]  Like if you're a kid and you're suspended from school, you're suspended because you're bitter you spit on somebody
[02:55:24.520 --> 02:55:26.840]  But in this case it was a general term for like
[02:55:26.840 --> 02:55:30.200]  Uh, just general, you know, misconduct
[02:55:30.760 --> 02:55:35.000]  Got it. Well, listen, brother, I gotta jump and thank you for your testimony. We want to get more of those testimonies
[02:55:35.320 --> 02:55:40.760]  God bless you, Tony because that's what goes on behind the scenes where they're uh, we had this report is on about this
[02:55:40.760 --> 02:55:44.680]  They're just like, yeah, we all get in the room. They go, we're gonna lie about Trump. Just make stuff up. Everybody go get him
[02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:46.440]  I mean, they don't even
[02:55:46.440 --> 02:55:52.440]  Assange is a real liberal. You know, I got a really personal and respectful taxi is a liberal not a you know, KKK person masquerading is a liberal
[02:55:52.440 --> 02:55:57.320]  He's like this press climate. We're all in danger. Hillary is a monster
[02:55:57.320 --> 02:56:04.600]  I mean, it's like why is the it's so shameful to see this level of control and they're only destroying themselves in the process
[02:56:04.920 --> 02:56:09.160]  Yeah, and the foundation is example of how corruption just breeds more corruption
[02:56:09.160 --> 02:56:13.640]  You would think you the third third most important person in America and you still want to be more corrupt
[02:56:13.800 --> 02:56:15.320]  You have no reason to be corrupt
[02:56:15.320 --> 02:56:21.960]  But it's so much more out there to that and and I think as far as the black population and minorities period
[02:56:21.960 --> 02:56:25.880]  I think they see that and I think that they they don't want to they don't want to vote for a crook
[02:56:25.880 --> 02:56:27.880]  And they'll they'll probably vote for Donald Trump
[02:56:28.200 --> 02:56:28.680]  Well, sure
[02:56:28.680 --> 02:56:30.120]  And a lot of polls he's way ahead
[02:56:30.120 --> 02:56:35.560]  But those are the scientific polls the big fake ones they put out where they had 15 percent more come on Reuters admits
[02:56:35.560 --> 02:56:41.560]  They had 15 percent more Democrats the poll and then Hillary's winning about 15 points. No, I mean, you know, it's like they don't
[02:56:41.560 --> 02:56:47.720]  They but because they put the methodology out. It's like it's okay. Oh, we stacked the deck. We admit we do so
[02:56:47.720 --> 02:56:53.800]  It's all right. What what no, yeah, it's not it's not a true and you only if you know that the true vision
[02:56:53.960 --> 02:56:57.240]  It's a look at it under undultrated lenses as if you're on the ground
[02:56:57.560 --> 02:57:00.360]  And I'm on the ground brother and I'm in and I'm in the hood
[02:57:00.600 --> 02:57:04.760]  No mistaken and these individuals are walking around talking about I'm gonna vote for Trump
[02:57:05.240 --> 02:57:09.720]  And it has very little to do with what it is that think they can get from him
[02:57:10.120 --> 02:57:14.280]  Is what it is they've been waiting for they've been waiting for a change and a growth
[02:57:14.280 --> 02:57:19.080]  They didn't get that from the previous administration and they feel abandoned by the the current administration
[02:57:19.320 --> 02:57:23.240]  And so they're gonna do whatever they can to that's what I'm seeing on the streets. I mean, I would say
[02:57:25.960 --> 02:57:29.960]  Half the black people I talked to say they like Trump, but they're almost embarrassed like well, Alex
[02:57:29.960 --> 02:57:35.160]  I can tell you but you know my neighbors don't like it and so yes people just get past this fear and come out of the closet
[02:57:35.240 --> 02:57:39.480]  That's right. That's right. And I talked about that, you know in the speech and I'm hoping that Donald Trump will
[02:57:39.480 --> 02:57:44.680]  Bring more black surrogates at these rallies so that you can dismay the
[02:57:45.400 --> 02:57:50.920]  Dispel the myth that blacks aren't coming out and I'm not talking about like like a entertainment
[02:57:51.080 --> 02:57:54.200]  You know Alex, I'm talking about giving a real speech to people
[02:57:54.520 --> 02:57:57.000]  That's what the kind of surrogate he needs out there right now
[02:57:57.240 --> 02:58:01.080]  Absolutely, he needs to absolutely hammer the daylights out of the globalist. The problem is a lot of times
[02:58:01.080 --> 02:58:03.880]  He does the videos doesn't cover. Yeah, so we have to get the videos
[02:58:03.880 --> 02:58:04.920]  We have to get the wrong stuff
[02:58:04.920 --> 02:58:11.320]  We have to put it out like info wars.com and prisonplanet.com and drudgereport.com are doing and that's why they say they want to censor Trump
[02:58:11.800 --> 02:58:16.120]  Uh, you know, I mean they have these fake debate coming up where he's back to back with Hillary
[02:58:16.280 --> 02:58:21.560]  But then he doesn't get to ask her questions. That's not a debate. No, no, she's been quiet. What over 260 days now
[02:58:22.520 --> 02:58:26.360]  Listen, I really believe she's got serious health problems and the word is brain tumor
[02:58:27.000 --> 02:58:29.800]  Uh, the brain tumor was removed back in 2012
[02:58:30.360 --> 02:58:32.360]  Uh, and then and it's growing back
[02:58:32.360 --> 02:58:36.040]  So, uh, that's why she is not looking too hot
[02:58:36.680 --> 02:58:39.400]  That's the word brain tumor. We'll be back
[02:58:40.680 --> 02:58:42.680]  You are listening to GCN
[02:58:43.960 --> 02:58:47.640]  Visit gcmi.com today. Hope she gets to ride with Jesus

[02:58:55.000 --> 02:59:00.120]  You worked, I guess like 20 plus hours. Tell us what brainforce did. I've been working all day
[02:59:00.120 --> 02:59:04.360]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball. I get in here at 8 30
[02:59:04.520 --> 02:59:07.800]  I was kind of run down, you know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it
[02:59:07.800 --> 02:59:09.720]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview
[02:59:10.040 --> 02:59:13.960]  I got my bottle of brain force right there. I popped two of them and about 20 minutes later
[02:59:13.960 --> 02:59:18.120]  It's like bing everything just kind of clears up. It's got four and a half stars
[02:59:18.360 --> 02:59:21.800]  People really love it. Read about it. Find out why third-party
[02:59:22.200 --> 02:59:29.480]  Neutraceutical sites give it such high praise because it really does have the best organic based systems that will blow your socks off
[02:59:29.480 --> 02:59:33.480]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without brain force
[02:59:33.560 --> 02:59:35.560]  I went home about 6 45 this morning
[02:59:36.040 --> 02:59:39.400]  Took three hours of sleep got up took two more brain force and came in
[02:59:39.720 --> 02:59:48.520]  You will find brain force and other game changing products at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139
[02:59:48.520 --> 02:59:55.880]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[03:00:06.920 --> 03:00:11.880]  The answer answer to 1984 is 1776
[03:00:12.920 --> 03:00:15.480]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[03:00:15.480 --> 03:00:22.440]  The answer is info war. The answer is reclaiming our basic roots and what works for a civilization
[03:00:24.040 --> 03:00:29.800]  Responsibility discipline pride honor strength courage
[03:00:31.720 --> 03:00:36.280]  And people are desperate for it like a man underwater wants oxygen. I'm desperate for it
[03:00:37.240 --> 03:00:40.200]  The new world order wants to make us weak so they can rule us
[03:00:40.920 --> 03:00:43.240]  I say folks that are act like that are the ones that are weak
[03:00:43.240 --> 03:00:48.520]  We're gonna go to some more of your phone calls here. I am really honored to have our
[03:00:49.240 --> 03:00:52.040]  W bray our w bray.com
[03:00:52.440 --> 03:00:55.240]  He's the black engagement director of the republican party of texas
[03:00:55.880 --> 03:01:01.560]  And it is exciting to see the patriot liberty movement taken over the republican party because it's got its own share of problems
[03:01:01.560 --> 03:01:03.800]  But this revolution of trump taking the party over
[03:01:04.360 --> 03:01:08.440]  Uh, they may try to take it back, but they are they are you know what in their britches?
[03:01:08.440 --> 03:01:15.800]  Yes, I'm happy for the rpt. You're putting a party texas finally growing up. We're doing things that no other state is doing and
[03:01:16.360 --> 03:01:18.360]  I love the fact that it's coming out of texas
[03:01:18.680 --> 03:01:20.680]  I really do. I'm proud of texas
[03:01:21.160 --> 03:01:24.440]  Texas always has that cliche and growing up your rebellions whatever you've been told is great
[03:01:24.840 --> 03:01:28.760]  But I mean now that I've grown up and know my parents and grandparents and texas isn't perfect
[03:01:28.760 --> 03:01:34.520]  But compared to a lot of the places in the world, whatever it is true like original texas. I knew we're just
[03:01:34.520 --> 03:01:39.720]  Uh, no matter what color they were. We're just honorable straight shooting. That's right and tough. That's right
[03:01:41.880 --> 03:01:45.160]  Texas is at the head of the resistance. That's what obama calls me the man from texas
[03:01:45.480 --> 03:01:49.000]  And I love the fact you won't say my name. He goes, you know, that's out of texas and the media is like, whoa
[03:01:50.360 --> 03:01:52.840]  It's it's almost better. It's like the name they won't say
[03:01:54.360 --> 03:01:55.800]  Actually, I can
[03:01:55.800 --> 03:02:00.200]  I can feel the eye of soron looking at me though. This is quite a responsibility these people are bad news
[03:02:00.280 --> 03:02:01.880]  That's why I joke about it
[03:02:01.880 --> 03:02:05.640]  Let's go ahead and talk to mike in minnesota. You're on the air. Go ahead
[03:02:07.160 --> 03:02:09.160]  Hey, alex. Thanks for having me on the show. I
[03:02:09.560 --> 03:02:11.240]  Literally just our listening love it
[03:02:11.240 --> 03:02:15.000]  But commenting on the whole charter schools and diversity that you guys talked about earlier
[03:02:15.240 --> 03:02:19.160]  I went to one of the largest high schools in minnesota and most
[03:02:19.640 --> 03:02:23.400]  Uh publicly funded and we had diversity programs everywhere
[03:02:24.040 --> 03:02:29.640]  And as we got older into school the more divided it came we had groups where it's a map to do it
[03:02:29.640 --> 03:02:36.200]  They go, they're failing and all the university studies. It's getting worse. It's designed to make us all racist crazy people. Sorry, go ahead
[03:02:37.240 --> 03:02:39.640]  Oh, yeah, and it would be divided up so that
[03:02:40.120 --> 03:02:42.200]  The small Ian refugees would be on the east end
[03:02:42.600 --> 03:02:47.480]  The afghan americans would be on the west and nobody really came together and we were in elementary school
[03:02:47.560 --> 03:02:52.280]  Wow, that's and that's how you run a president. It's president management. They're just putting us all in groups. Yeah
[03:02:53.480 --> 03:02:58.440]  Definitely no question and the teachers everybody don't want to do it. They're just like, why is this so horrible?
[03:02:58.440 --> 03:03:01.240]  Because it's designed to be that is a sad reality
[03:03:01.320 --> 03:03:05.400]  You know, I had a conversation with tom meckler who was the chairman of the rpt and we were talked about how
[03:03:05.960 --> 03:03:10.440]  The answer to compete with these failing ISDs and this like you said the separation
[03:03:11.160 --> 03:03:14.280]  Uh, it's a it's to make sure you have charter schools and academies to challenge it
[03:03:15.080 --> 03:03:18.520]  I don't I can't remember any institution that deserves a monopoly over education
[03:03:19.000 --> 03:03:21.480]  And then the way they do it is that they corral people
[03:03:21.800 --> 03:03:25.080]  Absolutely blacks are here the latinos are here the whites are here
[03:03:25.320 --> 03:03:27.320]  That doesn't encourage anyone to work together
[03:03:27.320 --> 03:03:33.480]  And then they act like it's desegregation when all they do is throw people together and then divide them even worse
[03:03:33.640 --> 03:03:37.400]  Yeah, I mean, they know then this is some slick stuff. Yeah, it's just teaching. Alex is sad
[03:03:38.280 --> 03:03:39.800]  But well, the great part is
[03:03:39.800 --> 03:03:42.760]  It's like those hidden pictures they're here on the wall when you don't see it you feel dumb
[03:03:42.760 --> 03:03:46.840]  But as soon as you see it's like, oh, why didn't I see that before I believe that I tell you do that
[03:03:46.840 --> 03:03:50.360]  Who does see the democrat party know exactly what they're doing and they've mastered it
[03:03:50.680 --> 03:03:56.200]  And I said we wake up and we have advocates would get out there and talk about it. Um, they'll continue to throw the wool of our eyes
[03:03:56.200 --> 03:03:59.400]  Mike did anybody else figure out what was going on when you were in Minnesota?
[03:04:00.680 --> 03:04:04.520]  Well, uh, Alex funny story is one of our history teachers
[03:04:04.520 --> 03:04:05.640]  I mean, I have to get older
[03:04:05.640 --> 03:04:10.680]  I probably learned the most amount of facts as an elementary school in terms of history and it just turned into more social
[03:04:10.680 --> 03:04:12.680]  arguments as we got into high school
[03:04:12.680 --> 03:04:14.840]  I graduated from high school five years ago
[03:04:15.320 --> 03:04:20.120]  And one of our teachers actually said that he couldn't wait for the baby boomer generation to die off
[03:04:20.360 --> 03:04:25.560]  That were republicans because then the real issues would be addressed exactly like like like we get somewhere
[03:04:25.560 --> 03:04:28.440]  Once you die, which is total totalitarianism
[03:04:29.720 --> 03:04:32.920]  Yeah, they don't know that the next crop of folks will be taught get rid of these people
[03:04:32.920 --> 03:04:36.920]  You get something say bill gates if we don't give an old lady treatment. We can hire 10 teachers
[03:04:36.920 --> 03:04:38.680]  They just like oh
[03:04:38.680 --> 03:04:44.280]  People die and I get things no you build an economy you take care old people and that builds an economy
[03:04:45.720 --> 03:04:50.600]  You you get the service and quality you demand it's called civilization. I'm in really impressed with the work you're doing
[03:04:50.680 --> 03:04:55.160]  Thank you so much. God bless you sir folks. You go to the website. It's rwbrae
[03:04:55.160 --> 03:04:58.680]  Dot com David night's coming up. I'm gonna introduce him. Stay with us
[03:04:59.960 --> 03:05:06.120]  The house oversight committee chairman and the house judiciary committee chairman are both raising the issue of whether hillary clinton
[03:05:06.200 --> 03:05:12.440]  Committed perjury when she testified under oath to congress the discrepancies between what she said and what fbi director
[03:05:12.600 --> 03:05:15.880]  Comey said are obvious even to the casual observer
[03:05:16.120 --> 03:05:19.240]  But you may say because the justice department is so politicized
[03:05:19.400 --> 03:05:23.000]  They won't ever prosecute hillary for crimes she commits and you're right
[03:05:23.000 --> 03:05:27.560]  But the president of judicial watch which has been at the forefront of investigating the corruption
[03:05:27.640 --> 03:05:32.200]  And the national security violations of hillary clinton points out in an interview with a daily mail
[03:05:32.360 --> 03:05:37.480]  Quote one of the dirty little secrets in washington is that mrs. Clinton can be impeached now
[03:05:37.720 --> 03:05:44.040]  A federal official leaving office does not end congressional jurisdiction over impeachment for misconduct in that office
[03:05:44.200 --> 03:05:49.480]  And if hillary was convicted by the senate the sanction could be indefinitely for future office
[03:05:49.480 --> 03:05:54.520]  Unquote will congress grow spine and check the corruption if they don't do it in an election year
[03:05:54.920 --> 03:05:57.640]  They won't ever rampa wars dot com. I'm david night

[03:07:12.200 --> 03:07:18.760]  Knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride the bad member of the halogen family into the water
[03:07:18.920 --> 03:07:26.120]  They took the good halogen and and put the deadly halogen in and when the fukushima crisis worsened as it still is worsening today

[03:08:14.040 --> 03:08:19.160]  From the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[03:08:22.920 --> 03:08:24.920]  What we were drawing attention to
[03:08:25.560 --> 03:08:27.000]  is the
[03:08:27.000 --> 03:08:29.000]  amazing transformation
[03:08:29.320 --> 03:08:31.880]  Of hillary clinton and the democratic party
[03:08:32.600 --> 03:08:37.400]  Into being the national security party and the national security candidate
[03:08:38.440 --> 03:08:39.480]  by
[03:08:39.480 --> 03:08:43.880]  whipping up a neo mcathias hysteria about russia
[03:08:44.520 --> 03:08:51.720]  I just any serious analyst understands that china and the united states are the only real games in town
[03:08:51.720 --> 03:08:56.760]  China has 10 times the population of russia seven times the gdp
[03:08:57.880 --> 03:08:59.880]  Russia has the gdp of italy
[03:09:00.840 --> 03:09:06.040]  It's interesting in that it wants to be you know that it makes provocative statements and so on it's interesting
[03:09:06.120 --> 03:09:08.120]  And of course within its own neck of the woods
[03:09:09.800 --> 03:09:12.680]  Countries in the in between russia and china
[03:09:13.640 --> 03:09:15.640]  caucuses and so on
[03:09:15.800 --> 03:09:18.040]  Of course russia is very significant to them
[03:09:18.040 --> 03:09:21.400]  But on the world stage russia is a big player
[03:09:22.520 --> 03:09:24.520]  now
[03:09:25.880 --> 03:09:31.240]  That that attempted reframing by hillary clinton to declare
[03:09:32.440 --> 03:09:35.720]  Media organizations that are publishing material that shows
[03:09:37.160 --> 03:09:41.960]  illicit behavior in the dnc to fix the election for her
[03:09:43.320 --> 03:09:45.320]  as somehow
[03:09:45.400 --> 03:09:47.400]  Us being russian agents
[03:09:47.400 --> 03:09:53.480]  Similar criticism has emerged from people connected to her her campaign to the intercept where green world
[03:09:54.200 --> 03:09:55.400]  works
[03:09:55.400 --> 03:09:58.280]  Her campaign has effectively called
[03:09:59.000 --> 03:10:01.000]  And maybe even directly called
[03:10:01.080 --> 03:10:03.800]  donald trump the opposition leader in this case
[03:10:04.680 --> 03:10:06.680]  a russian agent
[03:10:06.840 --> 03:10:08.360]  jill stein
[03:10:08.360 --> 03:10:11.880]  The greens party candidate effectively the fourth candidate in terms of numbers
[03:10:11.880 --> 03:10:18.520]  Uh, it's being also being called a russian agent. This this is a neo macarthia cisteria
[03:10:18.920 --> 03:10:20.920]  What kind of press environment
[03:10:21.800 --> 03:10:24.440]  Is this going to lead to post-election?
[03:10:25.560 --> 03:10:28.440]  that the the american press in in in
[03:10:28.920 --> 03:10:34.200]  The american liberal press uh in falling over themselves uh to defend hillary clinton
[03:10:34.840 --> 03:10:39.480]  Are erecting a demon uh that is going to put nooses around everyone's necks
[03:10:39.480 --> 03:10:43.560]  Uh, as soon as she wins the election, which he is almost certainly going to do
[03:10:45.480 --> 03:10:52.600]  That is part of the and i don't overuse the term epic it so much stuff is epic now because there's a quickening happening
[03:10:53.320 --> 03:10:55.320]  And the whole interviews on info wars.com
[03:10:56.040 --> 03:10:59.160]  Right now everybody needs to spread this interview to the four corners of the planet
[03:11:00.360 --> 03:11:05.480]  I mean that figuratively before the new york times says that i believe the earth is flat or four cornered
[03:11:05.480 --> 03:11:11.240]  You have trump going to mexico and saying globalism is screwing both our countries
[03:11:13.640 --> 03:11:19.240]  Carlos slumber the way is even a mexican can't make this stuff up and they are screwing everyone over
[03:11:19.880 --> 03:11:22.840]  Let's come together and the mexican president comes out and says i like trump
[03:11:23.400 --> 03:11:27.240]  And and the trump says they hit it off and you can see the body language when they're out their own stage together
[03:11:28.360 --> 03:11:30.920]  Because they misrepresent everything trump says
[03:11:30.920 --> 03:11:35.960]  Trump's like you grab people that come in from Guatemala. You can't have your border open and get people free stuff
[03:11:36.520 --> 03:11:39.880]  The mexicans are like, oh, yeah, that's true. I don't dislike you
[03:11:42.680 --> 03:11:45.880]  I mean we gotta have doors on our houses people
[03:11:46.920 --> 03:11:49.880]  And i'll be quite frank with you when trumps talked about this too
[03:11:50.920 --> 03:11:56.760]  I don't care if you're hispanic black white or whoever you are americans have killed our children well the credit to hispanics they
[03:11:56.760 --> 03:11:58.760]  They haven't done as much
[03:11:58.760 --> 03:12:03.240]  So hispanics deserve to take over the united states
[03:12:04.200 --> 03:12:08.920]  I mean quite frankly, it's the darwin award. You kill your kids. You deserve to not
[03:12:09.480 --> 03:12:10.920]  Be around anymore
[03:12:10.920 --> 03:12:13.400]  Fine repopulate the united states with mexicans
[03:12:13.960 --> 03:12:19.560]  The point is that they're politically bringing them in and brainwashing them to carry out the new world order
[03:12:19.720 --> 03:12:21.720]  It must be stopped
[03:12:21.720 --> 03:12:26.120]  The brainwashing the anchor babies the free crap. It's not fair. It's not right
[03:12:26.120 --> 03:12:32.120]  The ford foundation instilling all this race baiting. Why would the ford foundation give a hundred million dollars of blm?
[03:12:33.320 --> 03:12:35.320]  Because they're going to create
[03:12:35.400 --> 03:12:37.400]  basket cases where everyone
[03:12:37.560 --> 03:12:41.560]  Has chips on their shoulders and never overcomes and gets stronger. That's how you become a
[03:12:42.360 --> 03:12:43.160]  force
[03:12:43.160 --> 03:12:47.400]  No, you get a chip and your whole job in the world is having a chip on your shoulder
[03:12:48.680 --> 03:12:50.680]  It's the essence of immaturity
[03:12:51.240 --> 03:12:55.240]  And I used to wonder why I was working on ranches and stuff the cowboys would be mean to me and stuff at first
[03:12:55.240 --> 03:12:57.240]  They were just testing to see who I was
[03:12:58.600 --> 03:13:00.600]  And then by the end of the summer they were like
[03:13:01.160 --> 03:13:03.160]  tears in their eyes. I was leaving
[03:13:04.120 --> 03:13:07.160]  And I never sit there but people in my life and mess with them in front
[03:13:07.160 --> 03:13:11.560]  I guess I do now need to mess with people when they're first in my life or have a job or whatever to see who you are
[03:13:11.800 --> 03:13:14.680]  Let's mess with you. Let's find out what's really going on under here
[03:13:15.480 --> 03:13:18.600]  But as you get older you learn this stuff and then you look at what the media is doing
[03:13:18.600 --> 03:13:21.480]  You're like, oh my god. These are some nasty people now
[03:13:21.480 --> 03:13:27.560]  I want to turn the baton over to David. By the way, there's always a handsome guy, uh, but he looks like the most interesting man right now
[03:13:27.560 --> 03:13:33.000]  I'm ready for the second commercial. I think that we found your look with that gray suit and and uh, black shirt
[03:13:35.160 --> 03:13:40.920]  You look pretty sharp over there. Thanks, Alex. Yeah, I'm gonna talk about what I call Trump's Mexican summit
[03:13:40.920 --> 03:13:44.760]  Alex is pretty amazing because even his hardcore critics
[03:13:44.760 --> 03:13:51.320]  NPR of the Washington Post even Bill Crystal are talking about how he really
[03:13:51.800 --> 03:13:59.000]  Huge when yesterday's a grand slam. That's absolutely amazing. Yeah, and you know, of course also we look at what's going on with SpaceX
[03:13:59.000 --> 03:14:01.400]  I think there's a lot of metaphors to be seen here
[03:14:01.400 --> 03:14:05.240]  But one of the things I wanted to talk about was what you're just talking about with Julian Assange
[03:14:05.240 --> 03:14:12.280]  He said what the New York Times is selling is conspiracy and not journalism. That's absolutely true
[03:14:12.280 --> 03:14:20.040]  There's not an ounce of real facts in this and yet this conspiracy that the Russians are behind everything that happens bad to their
[03:14:20.200 --> 03:14:25.240]  To the Democrats that's being used in some very serious ways as we look at Homeland Security
[03:14:25.240 --> 03:14:30.200]  I thought it was very interesting in that article that you had the interview that you had earlier today
[03:14:30.920 --> 03:14:32.920]  We're talking to Scott Adams
[03:14:33.240 --> 03:14:35.880]  And at the very end of the interview you pointed out to him, you know
[03:14:35.960 --> 03:14:40.280]  Homeland security is angling to take over our elections. He goes no, I can't be true
[03:14:40.280 --> 03:14:42.280]  I mean, it's just so far out
[03:14:42.920 --> 03:14:48.680]  That that people can't and listen. I'm even conditioned with normalcy bias. Yeah, I should have been talking all day
[03:14:48.680 --> 03:14:52.760]  I thought of this earlier and didn't get back to it. I should have been talking all day productions
[03:14:53.240 --> 03:14:55.240]  showing it. I had this whole plan to
[03:14:56.440 --> 03:15:02.440]  You know get clips of Obama denying it and saying and then now they admit it and showing how mainstream news clips admitting
[03:15:02.600 --> 03:15:05.960]  That Goldman Sachs is installing presidents in Europe and explain
[03:15:05.960 --> 03:15:14.440]  Davos is calling for the end of elected governments. Yes, I mean, it's like do you understand folks?
[03:15:14.680 --> 03:15:17.960]  Hillary's putting out fundraising letters saying shut down
[03:15:19.320 --> 03:15:26.520]  The alt right and if she comes out and names yours truly, I mean, yeah, this is it people. It's real
[03:15:26.760 --> 03:15:28.760]  It hit me like a ton
[03:15:29.400 --> 03:15:33.560]  Of bricks this morning and I was absolutely upset. I never almost get hysterical
[03:15:33.560 --> 03:15:38.440]  I was just like really concerned. I was like, what is it? What is it? Oh my god. It was all the news
[03:15:38.440 --> 03:15:40.440]  I read early that morning before I exercised
[03:15:41.160 --> 03:15:45.000]  They clearly there's a demarcation line in the last few days. You can say it started
[03:15:46.120 --> 03:15:49.640]  September 1st 2016 we're in the new world order. It's on
[03:15:50.360 --> 03:15:53.880]  Everything is moving at let me let me get this exactly right
[03:15:55.160 --> 03:16:00.440]  Their takeover is now moving at 20 times the previous speed and I mean that number. I've really thought about that
[03:16:00.440 --> 03:16:08.040]  Before it was all incremental testing testing testing. It's now boom. Boom. I mean it is boom. We are in it now, David
[03:16:08.360 --> 03:16:09.000]  Yeah, Alex
[03:16:09.000 --> 03:16:12.120]  They they always say how does a very rich person go bankrupt?
[03:16:12.120 --> 03:16:18.040]  They asked a rich person once and he said well gradually at first and then very rapidly and that's what we're seeing happening here
[03:16:18.040 --> 03:16:23.400]  They've got this deadline. They've been talking about massive structural reorganization of the global governance
[03:16:23.560 --> 03:16:28.040]  I totally forgot you're right. Germany admits they're on the verge of collapse exactly and the average person
[03:16:28.040 --> 03:16:34.360]  It's too scary. Oh, they're not taking over the elections. Oh, Germany's not saying get emergency supplies prepare for a massive emergency
[03:16:34.440 --> 03:16:38.600]  And I'm so conditioned. I've been saying it for so long. I'm not even opportunity our horn, David
[03:16:38.840 --> 03:16:43.080]  Yeah, I think I've got the articles right here. Deutsche Bank refuses clients demand for physical gold
[03:16:43.640 --> 03:16:46.760]  And it goes on and on and on and they admit that they're telling
[03:16:47.400 --> 03:16:50.200]  David you covered it last Friday. What do you think the Germans?
[03:16:51.560 --> 03:16:57.000]  The national government says get ready for a serious emergency get food and water and the Germans clean the shelves off
[03:16:57.000 --> 03:17:01.960]  What is going on there? Oh, they're doing a lot of prepping and I think the key thing is there's a massive run
[03:17:02.440 --> 03:17:05.640]  On home safes because they can't trust the banks
[03:17:06.200 --> 03:17:09.080]  You've got this this negative interest rate that's going on
[03:17:09.080 --> 03:17:11.880]  They know that they could confiscate their money and call it a haircut
[03:17:12.280 --> 03:17:16.520]  They don't even want to put their money in safe deposit boxes because they know they'll steal that
[03:17:16.600 --> 03:17:22.440]  So you've got this massive movement a shortage of safes because everybody wants to take their cash home put there
[03:17:22.440 --> 03:17:27.400]  And why not? Why should they have to pay the banks to save their money instead of the banks paying them any interest
[03:17:27.400 --> 03:17:33.400]  They have to pay the banks and then have it subject to confiscation or uh, just outright theft if you want to call it
[03:17:33.400 --> 03:17:37.560]  By the way, us banks, you know in the new stress test reports. I didn't even cover this. I read this like a month ago
[03:17:37.800 --> 03:17:38.760]  I think was
[03:17:38.760 --> 03:17:42.440]  Market watch and I didn't even cover it because I've been so close to it for so long
[03:17:42.680 --> 03:17:46.760]  I don't want to just say we told you we told you we told you so I stuck at the stack David
[03:17:47.400 --> 03:17:49.320]  We should pull it up
[03:17:49.320 --> 03:17:52.840]  It was some kind of headline line. Let me let me go to a memory here. Let's see if I can still do this exact memory
[03:17:54.520 --> 03:17:55.880]  Uh
[03:17:55.880 --> 03:17:58.120]  us banks in next crisis
[03:17:59.160 --> 03:18:00.440]  might need
[03:18:00.440 --> 03:18:01.640]  us
[03:18:01.640 --> 03:18:03.640]  a gree style
[03:18:03.960 --> 03:18:08.840]  Bail in and then it went on to say they're preparing and looking at taking money out of your account
[03:18:09.080 --> 03:18:13.160]  Or negative interest rates where you pay them to have an account or or pay them to have money
[03:18:13.560 --> 03:18:17.240]  I mean, it's like they're actually in major publications now
[03:18:17.240 --> 03:18:19.240]  Looping us up
[03:18:19.880 --> 03:18:24.440]  For grabbing the money out of our accounts, David. Well, you know, that was one of the key things
[03:18:24.520 --> 03:18:25.960]  I think from Nigel frage
[03:18:25.960 --> 03:18:30.040]  I remember it was the time that he got up at the EU and he said who are you?
[03:18:30.680 --> 03:18:35.880]  To shut down the democratically elected leaders of Italy and Greece and put in these Goldman Sachs bankers
[03:18:36.040 --> 03:18:38.520]  Who are you to override that? But let's say it again. Let's say it again
[03:18:38.760 --> 03:18:44.120]  appointing presidents and prime ministers and then having sorrows get up and brag about it
[03:18:44.120 --> 03:18:47.640]  Davos with his little demon egghead and it's like what the
[03:18:48.200 --> 03:18:51.480]  You got an arts criminal war criminal overthrowing all these countries
[03:18:51.960 --> 03:18:54.920]  Running around in appointing leaders of countries
[03:18:55.400 --> 03:18:59.240]  Well, alex, you know that that story that uh was on drudge a couple of days ago
[03:18:59.240 --> 03:19:05.240]  It was a Breitbart story with bill clinton. They went back. They looked at the clinton global initiative where he was talking to the
[03:19:05.720 --> 03:19:11.560]  Uh, yogurt billionaire shabbani, uh yogurt and they were talking about how they could bring in these syrian refugees
[03:19:11.560 --> 03:19:15.880]  How they were the greatest people the greatest workers and entrepreneurs in the world. They could bring them in
[03:19:16.120 --> 03:19:21.880]  There's 10,000 empty homes in detroit and you know, hillary clinton's policy will bring in more people in her first term
[03:19:22.120 --> 03:19:25.160]  Than the entire population of detroit. Yeah, they're saying americas don't matter
[03:19:25.480 --> 03:19:28.520]  We're gonna resettle you and then give them welfare money
[03:19:28.920 --> 03:19:35.480]  Like like crops of things that are growing. Sorry. Go ahead and it's even worse alex because I covered that on tuesday's nightly news
[03:19:35.480 --> 03:19:39.160]  With leanne macadoo the fact that this guy who is this shabbani yogurt guy?
[03:19:39.160 --> 03:19:43.400]  Well, he's a turkish citizen who is sitting on the board of the new york fed
[03:19:43.880 --> 03:19:47.560]  Setting on monetary policy. He's not even an american citizen and furthermore
[03:19:47.560 --> 03:19:53.240]  he's sitting there with bill clinton and the clinton global initiative and talking about how they're going to establish
[03:19:53.800 --> 03:19:56.440]  Immigration policy. He's not even an american citizen
[03:19:56.680 --> 03:20:01.800]  And he's using these people as slaves when they come into his uh factory and they're gonna have basically the un
[03:20:02.600 --> 03:20:06.040]  EU oversee our election and have homeland security around it, but
[03:20:06.040 --> 03:20:11.800]  Donald Trump's wrong that they're gonna have feds involved and i'm wrong. Yeah, the oh the creature in texas is wrong
[03:20:11.800 --> 03:20:13.800]  I'm sorry. They're not their name now
[03:20:14.680 --> 03:20:18.920]  I'm gonna hand a baton to you in a moment. We I don't have a lot to cover here data, but but let me just add this
[03:20:20.440 --> 03:20:25.240]  Something I didn't drop the ball today, but it's epic level again. I use that word. It is big. It's biggest
[03:20:25.640 --> 03:20:27.640]  They're announcing youtube
[03:20:27.880 --> 03:20:31.800]  Uh google that have that have the politically correct moderators
[03:20:32.760 --> 03:20:34.760]  That banned people for no reason
[03:20:34.760 --> 03:20:36.760]  If they
[03:20:38.520 --> 03:20:41.000]  Don't like what you're doing they demonetize you basically steal your money
[03:20:41.800 --> 03:20:43.800]  That is the chinese model and drugsreport.com
[03:20:45.160 --> 03:20:47.160]  That's right is linked to our article on it
[03:20:48.440 --> 03:20:54.360]  Where they say you're gonna have a social credit rating that the state and the telecoms and and and the big
[03:20:55.080 --> 03:20:56.920]  internet companies decide
[03:20:56.920 --> 03:21:00.680]  Down to the point of not being able to buy or sell online and then finally not even having a job
[03:21:00.680 --> 03:21:04.760]  This is the communist chinese model to control. They're billion 300 million people
[03:21:05.320 --> 03:21:08.200]  And you've been to china you're adopted daughter from china. You've seen the slavery
[03:21:08.360 --> 03:21:13.560]  I mean you've you've described it to me the hellish orphanages imagine. This is how they control these poor people
[03:21:14.680 --> 03:21:17.240]  And and now they're bringing it here. I mean this is so
[03:21:18.280 --> 03:21:19.880]  draconian so
[03:21:19.880 --> 03:21:21.880]  flamingly evil
[03:21:22.040 --> 03:21:27.480]  But it's just in terms of service agreement like oh samsung. We're watching you off the camera at home
[03:21:27.480 --> 03:21:31.080]  behave yourself and they're like, okay, they're watching me big deal
[03:21:31.240 --> 03:21:36.440]  I mean, it's just an imagine david. It's gonna get crazier and crazier and crazier. I don't want to say this then i'm done
[03:21:37.400 --> 03:21:39.240]  Listen to me carefully folks
[03:21:39.240 --> 03:21:41.240]  This signifies
[03:21:41.240 --> 03:21:45.480]  How desperate they are that they're accelerating their plan which is way behind schedule
[03:21:45.960 --> 03:21:49.880]  Because they know people now understand globalism in the system and they get the con
[03:21:50.520 --> 03:21:55.880]  And and and it's it's exponentially growing and so when you see all this draconian action understand it's scary
[03:21:55.880 --> 03:22:00.120]  It's serious. We got to fight it. But it's a sign of their weakness. They are showing themselves
[03:22:00.280 --> 03:22:04.440]  They are moving quickly china's never had freedom. They're great smart people
[03:22:04.760 --> 03:22:08.520]  But they never had a magna card. I never had a 1776 doesn't mean we're perfect
[03:22:08.600 --> 03:22:12.360]  But we just got a few steps ahead of them if the chinese ever had free free market
[03:22:12.760 --> 03:22:14.760]  They will take over the planet and that's fine with me
[03:22:15.080 --> 03:22:19.880]  The point is is that the globalists don't want them to have that and they treat them like trash
[03:22:20.360 --> 03:22:22.360]  And they are totally abused
[03:22:22.360 --> 03:22:26.760]  And it is so sad and it is so out of control and
[03:22:27.960 --> 03:22:32.280]  We have to understand that we are in the crucible right now. We are in the arena
[03:22:32.600 --> 03:22:38.040]  This is history happening right now and I can tell you what donald trump talked to the mexican president about
[03:22:38.200 --> 03:22:42.040]  The president may get pressured. He may say some bad things later. He said some nice things so far
[03:22:42.120 --> 03:22:47.240]  So has trump said they really hit it off and I know what donald trump said to him not because I talked to donald trump
[03:22:47.240 --> 03:22:51.720]  But you watch about me six months might be a year might be tomorrow. It's going to come out
[03:22:52.360 --> 03:22:56.200]  I said he should say we're both being oppressed by globalism. Let's come together
[03:22:56.920 --> 03:23:00.760]  Because I know trump's so informed and has generals advising him. So I'm just going to stop right there
[03:23:01.320 --> 03:23:04.360]  I know the type of advice he's getting I know the intel he's getting that's why I know what he said
[03:23:04.840 --> 03:23:07.240]  I know he leaned across and said you want to free your people
[03:23:07.720 --> 03:23:12.520]  And actually let your country shine and with their great ingenuity and all their hard work and smarts and innovation
[03:23:13.880 --> 03:23:16.920]  You know they're laundering the drug money. You know the big banks run your country
[03:23:16.920 --> 03:23:19.320]  You know you've sold your people out for generations
[03:23:19.880 --> 03:23:24.440]  This can all change. I'm ready to break the will of the new world order and we can have real prosperity
[03:23:24.440 --> 03:23:25.400]  It's going to be hard
[03:23:25.400 --> 03:23:30.040]  But if you want the civil war that was started run by washington folks, you can bet you're the globalist
[03:23:30.360 --> 03:23:35.480]  But I guarantee you trump told him i'm ready to stop the oppression of mexico
[03:23:35.960 --> 03:23:38.200]  Because I looked at that president closely on the closer videos
[03:23:38.600 --> 03:23:44.360]  He had tears in his eyes during part of it because no president or person about me president would ever actually come and talk to him
[03:23:44.360 --> 03:23:49.080]  Yeah, trump trump completely blew the the blinders off that guy
[03:23:49.160 --> 03:23:52.760]  He was like a deer in the headlights folks because trump is like alex jones
[03:23:53.080 --> 03:23:59.480]  Imagine if I met with a mexican president and I was about to be president what I would say it'd be that I can guarantee you
[03:24:00.040 --> 03:24:02.040]  That's what trump said just as I said
[03:24:02.440 --> 03:24:06.440]  What trump should say yesterday. He didn't hear that for me. He was on airplane flying to mexico then
[03:24:07.480 --> 03:24:13.800]  The thing is trump doesn't listen to me the reason I've talked to trump and he clicks is it's all it's like finishing each other's sentences
[03:24:13.800 --> 03:24:18.600]  I'm gonna stop right there because they make news stories out of it. The point is trump is so dialed in
[03:24:19.240 --> 03:24:21.240]  It is crazy. Okay
[03:24:21.560 --> 03:24:22.520]  heaven
[03:24:22.520 --> 03:24:25.320]  Sent okay now. That's all I'm telling you
[03:24:26.360 --> 03:24:29.000]  I want to play one little clip to have some fun and then handle the time of the day at night
[03:24:30.040 --> 03:24:33.000]  People tell me take more time off. I need to so we went out with some friends boat
[03:24:33.960 --> 03:24:35.800]  and um
[03:24:35.800 --> 03:24:40.600]  Tim kennedy soldier and some of the other soldiers interesting fellows went out there with us
[03:24:40.600 --> 03:24:45.000]  my security just hold on out there was ridiculous and we're there and
[03:24:45.640 --> 03:24:51.080]  Uh, they're like tackling each other and fighting all this other stuff and I said, oh, yeah, and I didn't have to tell
[03:24:51.160 --> 03:24:55.880]  It's what's great about singing folks tell Tim. Hey tackle me. I was like, you know, I actually support Hillary Clinton
[03:24:56.120 --> 03:24:59.720]  I really like her now and he tackled me and again. That's what syncing up is about
[03:24:59.880 --> 03:25:06.040]  It's not that you're on the same page and that's what society's supposed to be like folks honor and in common sense
[03:25:06.120 --> 03:25:09.080]  You sink and the globalists are desyncing us
[03:25:09.080 --> 03:25:12.280]  Freedom is about sinking doesn't mean being on the same
[03:25:13.160 --> 03:25:16.600]  Piece of paper it means being in reality and then it's a clear path
[03:25:16.840 --> 03:25:20.680]  So it's a funny little clip, but it's funny to know it wasn't scripted
[03:25:21.640 --> 03:25:25.000]  It's like I knew he would do it. I said it it happened and again
[03:25:25.000 --> 03:25:28.680]  That's a little microcosm of what the me is trying to figure out with his trump stuff and me
[03:25:29.640 --> 03:25:35.080]  It looked trump and I are tuned into the same spirit. You understand the same animating it's it's folks
[03:25:35.080 --> 03:25:41.240]  It is metaphysical. It's incredible and it's happening and I'm just going to leave it right there. Okay, but
[03:25:42.200 --> 03:25:45.480]  This is what's happening. It's it's biblical ladies and gentlemen. Here's the clip
[03:25:46.040 --> 03:25:50.440]  I like Hillary Clinton. You know, that's where I support. So Tim Kennedy. I'm a sport Hillary right now
[03:25:57.000 --> 03:25:59.640]  And again, that's just a microcosm of not scripting something
[03:25:59.640 --> 03:26:04.280]  But it was scripted because he got exactly what I was saying. We were synced David night takeover
[03:26:04.280 --> 03:26:08.600]  Thanks for letting me take over 25 minutes of the show. We love you. Please continue. Oh, thank you, Alex
[03:26:08.600 --> 03:26:13.160]  You know, one of the things that's very dangerous and we're going to talk about what Julian Assange has said about
[03:26:13.880 --> 03:26:19.080]  Hillary's un-American activities commission because that's basically what it is. Remember when we had the McCarthyism
[03:26:19.480 --> 03:26:24.920]  We had the house un-American activities committee who act, you know, we don't even need to change the agronism
[03:26:25.000 --> 03:26:27.960]  You know, we should just stay with who act and just substitute for house
[03:26:27.960 --> 03:26:35.880]  Hillary because whenever anything happens to them, there's always you're with the Russians. It's actually pretty funny when you look at it
[03:26:36.360 --> 03:26:39.960]  But when we look at what's going on with Homeland Security and I think we need to really
[03:26:40.520 --> 03:26:43.880]  Delve into this and look at this carefully and think about what's going to happen with this
[03:26:43.880 --> 03:26:45.320]  You know, we've got Jay Johnson
[03:26:45.320 --> 03:26:51.640]  Who is whining about the fact that we've got 9,000 different jurisdictions running elections all over this country
[03:26:51.640 --> 03:27:00.200]  That's a good thing, but it's not if you want centralized control. You have to understand these people want a command control economy
[03:27:00.520 --> 03:27:03.800]  They want central control of everything because they are authoritarians
[03:27:04.520 --> 03:27:05.480]  and
[03:27:05.480 --> 03:27:11.160]  Think about what is going to happen if we centralized control of our elections. It means that they're going to also
[03:27:11.720 --> 03:27:18.440]  Standardize it. How are they going to standardize it? They're going to standardize it by making it more electronic. That is the key
[03:27:18.440 --> 03:27:25.560]  Vulnerability. So here are these people where everything is being hacked. The DNC is being hacked. Hillary is being hacked. You've got
[03:27:26.360 --> 03:27:29.800]  Personnel files from the federal government that have been hacked in a massive way
[03:27:30.360 --> 03:27:36.680]  Even the NSA has been hacked. Their hacking code was hacked. Okay, uh, that's a recursive
[03:27:37.560 --> 03:27:41.880]  Hack, I guess they hacked their hacking code and put it on the internet for sale. Okay
[03:27:41.880 --> 03:27:48.200]  So what would you want to do? I think you would want to not go into that environment until you've at least demonstrated
[03:27:48.520 --> 03:27:51.240]  That you have got some control over it, don't you?
[03:27:51.720 --> 03:27:56.520]  But instead what they want to do is to standardize that and that's really what's going to happen
[03:27:56.600 --> 03:27:59.560]  They're going to make our election system even more vulnerable
[03:28:00.200 --> 03:28:02.200]  Because they want to control it
[03:28:02.520 --> 03:28:08.360]  Understand that the forefront of electronic elections has been Hugo Chavez's Venezuela
[03:28:08.360 --> 03:28:16.360]  Smart Manic, the largest seller of electronic voting machines was created by Hugo Chavez Cronies
[03:28:16.600 --> 03:28:20.760]  In Venezuela to control the elections there and as we talked about last night
[03:28:20.760 --> 03:28:27.160]  They have a string of corruption throughout central and south america including the philippines. They go in they run these elections
[03:28:27.160 --> 03:28:31.720]  All of a sudden guess what the system went down and we lost 25 percent of the votes
[03:28:31.720 --> 03:28:36.120]  We don't have any audit trail for any of this stuff, but trust us. We know how they voted
[03:28:36.120 --> 03:28:40.200]  We're going to tell you how 25 percent of the people voted, but there's no audit trail for this
[03:28:40.440 --> 03:28:42.600]  This is the kind of corruption that we're looking at here
[03:28:43.080 --> 03:28:46.280]  And this is something that happened two years ago in brazil
[03:28:46.840 --> 03:28:53.080]  People there accused a very unpopular socialist who was found guilty of all kinds of corruption
[03:28:53.560 --> 03:28:59.640]  Money laundering campaign violation campaign contribution violation sounds very much like Hillary clinton, doesn't it?
[03:29:00.360 --> 03:29:03.640]  She was running for reelection all this stuff was happening the economy was
[03:29:03.640 --> 03:29:10.200]  Uh failing inflation was going up and there were massive corruption scandals and looting of a
[03:29:10.840 --> 03:29:15.160]  Oil company that they had taken government control of as all this was happening
[03:29:15.320 --> 03:29:20.360]  She was down anywhere from six and a half to ten points in the polls just before the election and then miraculously
[03:29:20.920 --> 03:29:24.840]  She wins even though she was immediate just prior to it. She was booed by
[03:29:25.400 --> 03:29:32.680]  A stadium of 60,000 fans. She wins. That's the danger of electronic elections. We can make it safe
[03:29:32.680 --> 03:29:35.720]  We can make it very simple. We know how to do it
[03:29:36.360 --> 03:29:43.720]  Use paper use human observers vote on the same day use photo IDs, but they don't want that
[03:29:44.120 --> 03:29:47.640]  They want it complex so they can rig it stay with us. We'll be right back
[03:29:49.320 --> 03:29:52.360]  We're on the march the empires on the run
[03:29:53.240 --> 03:29:56.040]  Alex Jones and the gcn radio network
[03:29:56.040 --> 03:30:08.200]  Once again, donald trump has stepped into the vacuum left by hillary and obama as he quickly accepted an offer from the mexican president to meet
[03:30:08.360 --> 03:30:12.760]  He not only met with a mexican president, but he took control of the press conference afterwards
[03:30:13.080 --> 03:30:20.920]  Infuriating trump's media opponents like spanish language channel anchor or hey ramos ramos inadvertently praised the leadership of trump
[03:30:21.000 --> 03:30:25.080]  when he unleashed a string of tirades on twitter in both english and spanish
[03:30:25.080 --> 03:30:31.000]  Excoriating the mexican president for looking passive even for agreeing with trump that nafta could be improved
[03:30:31.240 --> 03:30:38.920]  Meanwhile, hillary hasn't held a press conference for 272 days since the beginning of december before any primaries
[03:30:39.080 --> 03:30:46.600]  And we're now over 80 of the way through the election hillary could only carp from the sidelines as she did when trump visited flood victims of louisiana
[03:30:46.760 --> 03:30:53.880]  While she ignored them completely don't expect hillary to talk to the mexican president before the election because it would be followed by a press conference
[03:30:53.880 --> 03:30:57.560]  And she can't handle that brain for worse.com. I'm david night
[03:30:59.960 --> 03:31:05.560]  Brain force it's completely different try a bottle of it. Rob do joins us you worked

[03:31:14.360 --> 03:31:19.560]  I was kind of run down, you know, I just didn't feel like I was gonna make it and I really wanted to do a good job on the interview
[03:31:19.560 --> 03:31:23.800]  I got my bottle of brain force right there. I popped two of them and about 20 minutes later
[03:31:23.800 --> 03:31:27.880]  It's like bing everything just kind of clears up. It's got four and a half stars
[03:31:28.200 --> 03:31:31.640]  People really love it read about it find out why third-party

[03:31:39.400 --> 03:31:43.320]  I haven't pulled it all night or like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without brain force
[03:31:43.400 --> 03:31:45.400]  I went home about 6 45 this morning
[03:31:45.400 --> 03:31:53.000]  I took three hours of sleep got up took two more brain force and came in you will find brain force and other game changing products

[03:32:14.040 --> 03:32:18.600]  Obesity diabetes cancer heart disease and autoimmune illnesses are rampant
[03:32:18.840 --> 03:32:21.720]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge
[03:32:21.720 --> 03:32:25.000]  And everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease
[03:32:25.320 --> 03:32:29.240]  If you are dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity

[03:33:25.880 --> 03:33:31.720]  We now take you live to the central texas command center. It's alex jones
[03:33:35.880 --> 03:33:37.880]  Welcome back to the alex jones show on this
[03:33:38.760 --> 03:33:41.960]  month of this thursday september 1st 2016. It's been
[03:33:41.960 --> 03:33:46.360]  272 days since hillary clinton has done a press conference
[03:33:47.080 --> 03:33:53.480]  I think that's the reason why she didn't go down and talk to the mexican president because she couldn't handle a press conference afterwards
[03:33:53.560 --> 03:33:54.520]  but
[03:33:54.520 --> 03:33:57.400]  The press seems to be letting her get away with that and we're going to get back to the news here
[03:33:57.400 --> 03:34:01.800]  And I want to talk about spacex because I think it tells us a great deal about hillary clinton
[03:34:02.120 --> 03:34:05.240]  I think it even tells us something about 9 11 and
[03:34:05.240 --> 03:34:12.120]  Also julien assange what he's talking about with the new york times. I think tells us gives us some insights about 9 11
[03:34:12.120 --> 03:34:16.520]  We've had w&d put out a story today talking about 9 11. So
[03:34:17.160 --> 03:34:20.760]  Welcome w&d. I'm glad they're talking about that. They've talked about it
[03:34:21.320 --> 03:34:25.080]  Before in the past they took it on directly this time. So we're going to talk about that story as well coming up
[03:34:25.400 --> 03:34:27.720]  Before we do real quickly. We have 20 off

[03:35:29.000 --> 03:35:34.440]  If you want to help support the operation that we would really appreciate that but we'll offer it to you for cost
[03:35:34.840 --> 03:35:36.680]  because we are
[03:35:36.680 --> 03:35:44.440]  Serious about hillary clinton needing to go to prison not to the white house now. Let's talk about what happened today with spacex
[03:35:45.800 --> 03:35:50.840]  We had a rocket that was going to take up facebook's newest internet satellite
[03:35:50.840 --> 03:35:54.680]  It was a 200 million dollar satellite. That's a lot of money
[03:35:54.840 --> 03:35:58.840]  But think about it this way if if you're if you're a facebook executive
[03:35:58.840 --> 03:36:01.560]  I want to talk to mark zuckerberg now and tell mark
[03:36:02.200 --> 03:36:03.560]  it's not
[03:36:03.560 --> 03:36:08.040]  All that bad that's less than half of what obama sent in a
[03:36:08.600 --> 03:36:13.080]  Palat's load of cash to the iranians. Okay, he sent them 450 million
[03:36:13.080 --> 03:36:18.760]  So this is only 200 million mark and i'm sure that obama can make it up to you because you guys are really good friends
[03:36:18.760 --> 03:36:22.200]  Maybe, you know, he can find some more cash in a swiss bank
[03:36:22.520 --> 03:36:26.760]  That he can put on a palette and send to you to kind of cover those costs there if you're not insured
[03:36:26.760 --> 03:36:33.480]  So 200 million dollars, but it's less than obama sent to iran. Okay, and burned on that particular mission
[03:36:34.040 --> 03:36:40.440]  A series of explosions since smoke and flames shooting through the sky and shook buildings miles away
[03:36:40.920 --> 03:36:45.960]  You know when I saw that I thought about what hillary clinton said earlier this week when she was talking about
[03:36:45.960 --> 03:36:47.960]  All of her
[03:36:48.600 --> 03:36:55.160]  Corruption her privileged immunity, you know acting as if I guess she's got diplomatic immunity because she was secretary of state
[03:36:55.400 --> 03:36:58.520]  She can't be prosecuted no matter what she does or maybe that
[03:36:59.000 --> 03:37:04.200]  Immunity comes from being a clinton. I don't know we're just the people that she knows or what she knows about people
[03:37:04.200 --> 03:37:07.400]  Maybe that's it. Maybe it's what hillary knows about people
[03:37:07.960 --> 03:37:12.360]  But when I looked at that I thought about it shocking buildings miles away, you know, I thought about how
[03:37:13.000 --> 03:37:15.000]  her corruption has
[03:37:15.000 --> 03:37:18.040]  Sent shock waves through our political system
[03:37:18.840 --> 03:37:25.320]  And how it is destroying our political system, but also her remarks remember earlier this week. She said, you know
[03:37:26.120 --> 03:37:29.960]  These emails there's lots of smoke, but there's no fire now. Look at this picture
[03:37:30.520 --> 03:37:34.440]  I tweeted this out earlier today. I tweeted out the picture one of the pictures is up there
[03:37:34.920 --> 03:37:36.920]  Yeah, there's a lot of smoke there
[03:37:37.000 --> 03:37:42.600]  But you can also see there's fire because you know, that's the metaphor actually hillary. That's the true metaphor
[03:37:42.600 --> 03:37:47.720]  You're trying to sell us a phony metaphor where there is smoke there is fire
[03:37:47.720 --> 03:37:53.400]  You can see that fire on the launching pad as the facebook satellite and the rocket that is on
[03:37:54.040 --> 03:37:58.760]  Blow up explode and catch fire. Okay, but now as I put out as I tweeted out, you know
[03:37:59.080 --> 03:38:02.120]  Hillary said well, there's lots of smoke, but no fire. She looks at that brazil
[03:38:02.680 --> 03:38:08.600]  Donna brazil of the democrat national committee. She's now taking the place of hillary's other friend debbie wassenman schultz
[03:38:08.600 --> 03:38:15.000]  Uh, she says no, no, no, I don't see any smoke because that's what she said earlier this week when she was on the talk shows
[03:38:15.480 --> 03:38:21.080]  And they were asking her about it even as they go and I put that hashtag bleach bit there because
[03:38:21.960 --> 03:38:28.520]  You know, even as they're talking about the industrial software that she put in there, which doesn't just delete a file
[03:38:28.840 --> 03:38:33.160]  But it overwrites your disc so that you can't recover the information
[03:38:33.400 --> 03:38:36.040]  You know, the information is there. You can always reverse engineer that
[03:38:36.040 --> 03:38:39.400]  Uh with some recovery software they go back they lose the directory
[03:38:39.400 --> 03:38:43.480]  But they can as long as the information is still on the disc they can rebuild that especially with a text file
[03:38:43.880 --> 03:38:46.040]  So they use something like bleach bit
[03:38:46.600 --> 03:38:50.760]  To actually overwrite the data on the disc so that it's not recoverable
[03:38:51.160 --> 03:38:57.080]  The only good thing about this I guess is that um, the people in africa have now been granted a reprieve
[03:38:57.560 --> 03:39:03.240]  From being dominated by facebook uh temporary reprieve at least uh, they're going to keep going with that
[03:39:03.240 --> 03:39:07.880]  But let's talk about what alex jones brought up earlier talking about julian assange
[03:39:08.360 --> 03:39:10.520]  There's a new york times article that came out
[03:39:11.160 --> 03:39:17.560]  That is accusing wiki leaks of being affiliated with russian intelligence and again as we were saying it is
[03:39:18.360 --> 03:39:25.000]  The charge that they're leveling at everybody anybody that is an enemy of theirs is part of russian intelligence
[03:39:25.080 --> 03:39:26.760]  And he had this to say
[03:39:26.760 --> 03:39:31.560]  This is the rt story says wiki leaks has dismissed a wordy article by the new york times
[03:39:31.560 --> 03:39:39.480]  Suggesting that leaks by former by founder julian assange may have benefited moscow or come from quote russian intelligence
[03:39:39.480 --> 03:39:40.440]  I'm quote
[03:39:40.440 --> 03:39:44.120]  They said the claims are false and that they impute conspiracy
[03:39:44.600 --> 03:39:47.480]  And this is done that today this article came out today
[03:39:47.560 --> 03:39:52.120]  They claim quote the agendas of wiki leak and the kremlin have often dub paled
[03:39:52.440 --> 03:39:58.680]  They also said the majority of julian assange's revelations had an anti-american slightly pro russia bias
[03:39:58.680 --> 03:40:01.640]  Without citing a reliable proof
[03:40:01.880 --> 03:40:09.480]  The newspaper went on to speculate that assange could have received democrat party documents leaked earlier this year from russian intelligence
[03:40:10.120 --> 03:40:16.840]  Now wiki leaks replied and said the only hard news in this new york times article is that quote
[03:40:17.320 --> 03:40:19.320]  american officials say
[03:40:19.320 --> 03:40:26.280]  Mr. Assange and wiki leaks probably had no direct ties to russian intelligence services unquote and he points out that was said
[03:40:26.280 --> 03:40:34.520]  By james clapper head of u.s. Intelligence. He stated the u.s. Government has not been able to make any attribution
[03:40:35.800 --> 03:40:38.360]  We've also had the former head of
[03:40:39.160 --> 03:40:42.840]  Technical intelligence at the nsa william benny come on our show and tell us
[03:40:43.320 --> 03:40:48.200]  That not only does he believe that the nsa has the information if they want to get it that they can put out there
[03:40:48.200 --> 03:40:52.200]  But he says he has a reason to believe that there's a lot of people that work within the nsa
[03:40:52.200 --> 03:40:57.400]  That would be so angry and what hillary clinton would do that they and get away with it
[03:40:57.800 --> 03:41:01.720]  Putting their dain their lives in danger many people have lost their lives actually
[03:41:02.680 --> 03:41:08.440]  Judge napolitano said that as well. He said there's people in the intelligence community who have lost their lives
[03:41:08.920 --> 03:41:10.920]  over hillary clinton's leaks
[03:41:11.240 --> 03:41:15.080]  And they're very concerned about what's going to happen with a president hillary clinton
[03:41:15.880 --> 03:41:17.320]  all of their heads
[03:41:17.320 --> 03:41:22.520]  Are basically in the chopping block in the guillotine if hillary clinton becomes president
[03:41:22.760 --> 03:41:24.440]  So they're angry about what's happened
[03:41:24.440 --> 03:41:29.720]  They're angry about how she has exposed people how many of them believe she has already cost people their lives
[03:41:30.200 --> 03:41:36.200]  And this is not we're not talking about arkansas here. We're talking about costing people their lives because you've leaked intelligence
[03:41:37.240 --> 03:41:39.240]  That exposes them in the field
[03:41:39.560 --> 03:41:41.880]  and these 30 emails that they just found that
[03:41:41.880 --> 03:41:48.040]  Uh, they've just turned up again. This is uh, you know, she used to say that bill had these
[03:41:48.760 --> 03:41:54.760]  Bimbo eruptions and these people were not bimbos. Okay, there were some bimbos and that's what they wanted to focus on
[03:41:54.760 --> 03:41:58.600]  That's what kin star wanted to focus on kin star wanted to focus on the bimbos
[03:41:58.920 --> 03:42:02.920]  Not the people who were raped who were sexually abused by bill clinton
[03:42:03.320 --> 03:42:09.400]  Okay, he wanted to focus on the people that were having consensual sex with bill clinton and that's the way
[03:42:09.400 --> 03:42:16.760]  They they excused him. He turned that attention over there and we've seen after kin star left as
[03:42:17.480 --> 03:42:22.440]  Quote-unquote special prosecutor to bill clinton. What did he do? He wound up becoming a defender
[03:42:23.000 --> 03:42:28.360]  Of epstein jeffrey epstein the serial pedophile who was a friend of bill clinton
[03:42:29.000 --> 03:42:30.120]  kin star
[03:42:30.120 --> 03:42:36.040]  Defended that man defended that man in court and then kin star at baler no longer at baler
[03:42:36.040 --> 03:42:39.080]  Uh, defended football players who were accused of rape
[03:42:39.720 --> 03:42:46.280]  But what he did with bill clinton to defend him was basically to deflect attention to bimbos not to victims
[03:42:46.600 --> 03:42:51.960]  Okay, but hillary clinton has got her own eruptions this continual trickle
[03:42:52.680 --> 03:42:53.480]  of
[03:42:53.480 --> 03:42:56.680]  Things that are being released emails that are showing uh, they're
[03:42:57.480 --> 03:43:05.000]  What they have done secretly how they have set up pay for play how they have played fast and loose and carelessly
[03:43:05.000 --> 03:43:10.760]  With national security issues, but then they go on in this article. They say, uh, this is from wicked leaks a tweet from them
[03:43:10.760 --> 03:43:15.720]  They say no julien assange did not say that clinton is a demon. Uh, yeah, actually that would be us
[03:43:16.040 --> 03:43:18.040]  Let's get the attribution right
[03:43:19.480 --> 03:43:24.760]  He says the demon is neo macartheist hysteria that has been erected by the liberal press now
[03:43:24.840 --> 03:43:27.560]  We did say she's a demon and we will gladly
[03:43:28.120 --> 03:43:33.080]  Accept that because we really do believe that she is and then they went on to say this last thing
[03:43:33.080 --> 03:43:35.720]  I'll have to say about this the wicked leak statement rejected
[03:43:36.600 --> 03:43:43.880]  The notion that wiki leaks is a sympathizer to moscow. They said wiki leaks has published more than 650 000 documents
[03:43:44.200 --> 03:43:48.040]  About russia and about president putin most of which are critical
[03:43:48.920 --> 03:43:52.040]  So the point of wiki leaks is to expose
[03:43:53.000 --> 03:43:55.000]  secret hidden agendas
[03:43:55.880 --> 03:43:58.360]  Because secret hidden agendas create corruption
[03:43:58.360 --> 03:44:05.400]  They give people who are prone to uh, be corrupted by power and everybody is prone to be corrupted by power
[03:44:05.400 --> 03:44:12.360]  But uh, the worst people uh seem to be able to actually achieve their uh, their goal of getting the power
[03:44:13.080 --> 03:44:14.680]  but it's that
[03:44:14.680 --> 03:44:16.760]  That corruption that comes with power that gets
[03:44:17.480 --> 03:44:22.920]  It's like pouring gasoline on the fire when there is no transparency where there is no oversight
[03:44:22.920 --> 03:44:29.160]  And so the mission of wiki leaks has been to expose this to make people who hate
[03:44:29.880 --> 03:44:36.120]  Transparency people like barack obama people like george w. Bush people especially like hillary clinton
[03:44:36.520 --> 03:44:39.320]  To expose what they are doing in the dark
[03:44:39.880 --> 03:44:43.480]  To shine light on she talks about the dark corners of the internet. No she
[03:44:44.280 --> 03:44:49.880]  Is doing the things in the dark the internet is the light that is shining on what hillary clinton is doing
[03:44:49.880 --> 03:44:56.280]  And then as we talk about this conspiracy, you know, whether it's it is a conspiracy now we have the new york times
[03:44:56.920 --> 03:44:58.200]  openly
[03:44:58.200 --> 03:45:04.360]  Engaging in conspiracy theories and then I thought it was interesting to see this article today appear on world net daily wnd
[03:45:05.880 --> 03:45:11.960]  Talking about the government's other conspiracy theory, you know the official 9-11 story, you know the idea
[03:45:12.680 --> 03:45:14.680]  that two planes
[03:45:15.080 --> 03:45:17.880]  Caused three buildings to collapse
[03:45:17.880 --> 03:45:21.880]  in their footprint, okay, just think about that for a moment and
[03:45:22.920 --> 03:45:27.160]  Along those lines along the physical lines of that, of course, there's a lot of different
[03:45:28.520 --> 03:45:35.000]  Angles we can look at this and say, you know what the government's official conspiracy theory about 9-11 cannot be true
[03:45:35.640 --> 03:45:37.240]  again going back to
[03:45:37.240 --> 03:45:43.000]  Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes he says when you eliminate the impossible whatever remains however improbable
[03:45:43.880 --> 03:45:45.880]  is the truth, okay, so
[03:45:45.880 --> 03:45:50.120]  When you eliminate things that cannot happen like these three
[03:45:51.240 --> 03:45:55.720]  Skyscrapers falling into their footprint when only two of them were even hit by a plane
[03:45:56.360 --> 03:45:58.360]  That's when we start to
[03:45:58.360 --> 03:46:02.680]  Look at some things that might be true. Now. Why did they bring this up again? We've just had
[03:46:03.240 --> 03:46:06.600]  Another physics magazine. This is a Euro physics magazine
[03:46:07.040 --> 03:46:13.320]  Respective publication the European physics community has published a report by four experts who say the evidence points
[03:46:13.320 --> 03:46:18.600]  overwhelmingly to the conclusion that all three buildings were destroyed by controlled demolition
[03:46:19.400 --> 03:46:22.840]  and that has far-reaching political implications
[03:46:23.480 --> 03:46:27.320]  Because you'd have to prepare that in advance if you're going to have a demolition
[03:46:27.480 --> 03:46:31.320]  Just like you have to prepare the solution, you know when you say that we've got
[03:46:32.440 --> 03:46:36.360]  We've got evidence and the FBI comes out and says we've got some evidence that a couple of
[03:46:37.080 --> 03:46:41.720]  States had some Russians snooping around in their election system
[03:46:41.720 --> 03:46:43.720]  So I think we need to take it over
[03:46:44.200 --> 03:46:50.520]  They are giving you a load of baloney just so they can sell you the solution that they already wanted to do
[03:46:50.600 --> 03:46:53.320]  Which is a government takeover. That's always what they want to sell
[03:46:53.720 --> 03:46:55.560]  They say given the far-reaching implications
[03:46:55.640 --> 03:47:00.680]  It is morally imperative that this hypothesis be the subject of a truly scientific
[03:47:01.480 --> 03:47:05.240]  Impartial investigation by responsible authorities said the four physicists
[03:47:05.240 --> 03:47:11.960]  And then they point out in this article from w&d that in august 2002 the u.s. National Institute of Standards and Technology
[03:47:12.280 --> 03:47:14.280]  NIST and we've talked about this before as well
[03:47:14.840 --> 03:47:16.200]  even NIST
[03:47:16.200 --> 03:47:23.640]  Found that the three buildings were the only known cases of total structural collapse and high-rise buildings where fires played a
[03:47:23.880 --> 03:47:25.480]  significant role
[03:47:25.480 --> 03:47:30.840]  Quote from NIST the government's own scientific standards and technology organization
[03:47:30.840 --> 03:47:33.400]  They say it bears repeating that fires have never
[03:47:33.400 --> 03:47:38.520]  Caused the total collapse of a steel framed high-rise before or since 9 11
[03:47:39.160 --> 03:47:45.080]  Okay, did we witness an unprecedented event three separate times on september 11th? Yeah
[03:47:45.800 --> 03:47:52.040]  Again two planes three buildings do the math, okay, and then they go on to talk about some of the other aspects of it
[03:47:52.040 --> 03:47:55.480]  I have to ask, you know, where are the lawsuits? We just had a lawsuit
[03:47:56.280 --> 03:48:01.880]  That was shut down out in colorado. You know, they every time there's a shooting they try to come after the
[03:48:01.880 --> 03:48:05.880]  uh place where the shooting occurred the movie theater in aurora, colorado
[03:48:05.960 --> 03:48:12.760]  Or they go after gun manufacturers even though there are laws that say you can't sue a gun manufacturer just because they make guns
[03:48:13.240 --> 03:48:19.960]  That doesn't make it make the give them any liability any criminal liability in that crime just like you can't
[03:48:20.440 --> 03:48:23.080]  Uh sue ford if you've got a jihadi
[03:48:24.040 --> 03:48:27.560]  Using a ford truck to run down people at a french beach, okay?
[03:48:27.560 --> 03:48:33.960]  The people who made that truck didn't do anything wrong. It was a person who was running people down that did something wrong
[03:48:34.760 --> 03:48:36.760]  But where are the people suing?
[03:48:37.160 --> 03:48:41.960]  The engineers and architects that that built the world trade center where they why aren't they suing?
[03:48:42.440 --> 03:48:48.440]  The building inspectors there in new york city who inspected that who went over their design who double-checked that
[03:48:48.760 --> 03:48:50.760]  Why aren't they suing the people who built it?
[03:48:51.080 --> 03:48:52.680]  interesting isn't it
[03:48:52.680 --> 03:48:59.320]  Now i want to abruptly change this i got a story just as we went to break that kit daniels gave to me. This is something we've talked about before
[03:49:00.280 --> 03:49:03.800]  gary johnson loves to say that he's not against the second amendment even though
[03:49:04.200 --> 03:49:08.120]  He chose william weld who is against the second amendment and said, you know
[03:49:08.200 --> 03:49:13.800]  I'm not going to run as a libertarian candidate if i don't get william weld as my vp
[03:49:13.880 --> 03:49:18.040]  He was very adamant about that and there was a lot of debate at the time within the party
[03:49:18.040 --> 03:49:23.400]  So this guy has been against the second amendment from the get-go and now the nra is pointing that out
[03:49:23.400 --> 03:49:29.640]  This is a story by kit daniels and info wars dot com the libertarian party is running out running an anti-gun candidate for vice president
[03:49:30.040 --> 03:49:35.560]  Warns the nra. They say as governor of massachusetts william weld supported various gun control schemes
[03:49:35.960 --> 03:49:42.680]  Including a ban on semi-automatic firearms the nra also says unfortunately and despite being the libertarian candidate for vice president
[03:49:43.000 --> 03:49:45.320]  weld continues his anti-gun ways
[03:49:45.320 --> 03:49:51.960]  Weld recently confirmed his anti-gun stance and his ignorance on guns in general writes a kit. He says
[03:49:52.680 --> 03:50:00.280]  This is a quote from william weld in an interview just recently in august the five shot rifle says weld
[03:50:00.600 --> 03:50:02.600]  That's a standard military rifle
[03:50:03.320 --> 03:50:09.960]  The problem is if you attach a clip to it so it can fire more shells and if you remove the pins it becomes an automatic weapon
[03:50:09.960 --> 03:50:15.720]  And those are independent criminal offenses. That's when it becomes essentially a weapon of mass destruction
[03:50:16.360 --> 03:50:19.320]  And he also attacked a r15s. Well, let me tell you something weld
[03:50:20.440 --> 03:50:26.280]  You should take a look at the flag that we have all over here in texas. Come and take it flag
[03:50:26.600 --> 03:50:30.440]  You know it's on that flag. It's not a musket. It's a cannon
[03:50:30.920 --> 03:50:31.960]  It's a cannon
[03:50:31.960 --> 03:50:36.760]  You know when they went to get the arms at conquered in lexington in massachusetts where you are governor
[03:50:36.760 --> 03:50:40.920]  They went there to take the cannons not just the firearms
[03:50:41.080 --> 03:50:45.480]  The second amendment is about the militia protecting our country not a standing army
[03:50:45.800 --> 03:50:53.560]  They were supposed to be military weapons to protect us from foreign and domestic enemies. Stay with us. We'll be right back
[03:50:53.560 --> 03:51:07.080]  Extendivite is more than just a heart tonic. Most basic diseases are caused by yeast in the gut and metals in the liver
[03:51:07.240 --> 03:51:12.280]  And we all have a bit of both the garlic in extendivite has a yeast killing effect in the gut
[03:51:12.360 --> 03:51:15.960]  While also helping the sulfur enzyme in the liver get rid of the metals
[03:51:16.360 --> 03:51:19.880]  Extendivite just may improve your overall health
[03:51:19.880 --> 03:51:24.440]  Products like extendivite are the only way we're going to get our society healthy
[03:51:24.760 --> 03:51:31.320]  And if you're waiting for the government and pharmaceutical care to solve your health problems, you're going to have a long disappointing weight
[03:51:31.640 --> 03:51:38.520]  I think extendivite is a complete formula for extended life in the new millennium 80 can be the new 60
[03:51:38.840 --> 03:51:45.720]  Extendivite is available in capsule or liquid form for just 69 95 for a two month supply to get started call 1

[03:52:06.200 --> 03:52:12.120]  I'm worried we won't have enough to retire. Jim next door told me that he had set up a new kind of IRA with a gold silver group
[03:52:12.120 --> 03:52:18.280]  He said how simple and safe it was. It's a private storage IRA and we could have real gold and silver in our hands
[03:52:18.520 --> 03:52:21.880]  Really? You mean we can actually see it and touch it? Absolutely
[03:52:22.120 --> 03:52:26.520]  Jim said we could have all the benefits of an IRA to help build a retirement income bottom line
[03:52:26.520 --> 03:52:32.360]  We would own a real tangible asset and we would have the security of knowing we're protected no matter what the economy does

[03:54:03.800 --> 03:54:28.440]  All right, welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David Knight. We're gonna talk about Donald Trump's Mexican summit because I think that's really what we had to talk about it so
[03:54:28.440 --> 03:54:35.960]  Much of a victory. We've got an article here from the Hill saying Trump has the ball and Hillary can't run out the clock
[03:54:36.360 --> 03:54:40.760]  We're gonna take a look at what Donald Trump's critics said about what happened yesterday
[03:54:40.920 --> 03:54:46.760]  But before we do real quickly just want to let you know that our initial supply of bio true selenium is running low
[03:54:46.760 --> 03:54:52.200]  You'll find that at info wars life.com again. This is our initial run of a new selenium
[03:54:52.200 --> 03:54:58.760]  That we are selling at info wars life.com. This is from an 100% organic source
[03:54:59.080 --> 03:55:05.720]  So 100% organic mustard seed they press it out of that so you not only do you not get some trace heavy metals that you might get in some
[03:55:06.280 --> 03:55:08.840]  Mineral formulations of selenium. It's not synthetic
[03:55:09.160 --> 03:55:13.960]  It is organic and it doesn't have any of these heavy metals as a matter of fact when they press it out of the
[03:55:14.440 --> 03:55:19.000]  Organic mustard seed you actually get some good things out of that as well
[03:55:19.000 --> 03:55:25.320]  But again, it's something that is very important for your health and that's a new formulation that we have at infowarslife.com

[03:56:04.120 --> 03:56:08.520]  Let's talk real quickly in the time we got left about trump's mexican summit. This is the washington post
[03:56:09.160 --> 03:56:13.080]  No friend to donald trump. They say donald trump went to mexico and won
[03:56:13.080 --> 03:56:14.760]  Okay
[03:56:14.760 --> 03:56:17.960]  Hillary was the loser in this folks. That's not their subtitle
[03:56:18.280 --> 03:56:22.280]  But they say after weeks of scrutiny actually after weeks of attack by this same
[03:56:22.760 --> 03:56:26.040]  Organization the washington post new york times cnn etc
[03:56:26.360 --> 03:56:31.720]  But after weeks of that trump needed to restore some sense of legitimacy and strength to his flailing campaign. Yeah
[03:56:32.200 --> 03:56:39.080]  I don't think it was flailing. But anyway, what better way to do this than to stand statesman like next to the president of mexico
[03:56:39.080 --> 03:56:43.240]  Trump says the washington post played the role to perfection
[03:56:43.880 --> 03:56:47.400]  Subdued even solemn. He owned the proceedings
[03:56:48.040 --> 03:56:52.840]  Trump chose when and how he wanted to visit mexico. He established the meetings agenda
[03:56:52.920 --> 03:56:57.720]  He laid out a five-point plan for a bilateral relationship and a potential trump presidency
[03:56:57.960 --> 03:57:05.000]  He even chose who got to ask the questions during the brief news conference that followed the usual statements because you know
[03:57:05.320 --> 03:57:06.840]  He's had a lot of practice doing this
[03:57:06.840 --> 03:57:13.880]  He's had 16 press conferences. Hillary has had zero press conferences and they go on to say
[03:57:14.760 --> 03:57:21.880]  He definitely placed himself on equal footing with the president of mexico a master of optics trump used the setting to his advantage
[03:57:22.360 --> 03:57:24.200]  Calling piano
[03:57:24.200 --> 03:57:28.280]  Pina nato. I don't know how to pronounce his name. Sorry folks. I'm not spanish
[03:57:29.160 --> 03:57:33.400]  A master of optics. He used the setting to his advantage. He called him a friend
[03:57:33.400 --> 03:57:39.960]  He conveniently shook his hand for a front page ready photos. He avoided anything resembling an apology
[03:57:40.360 --> 03:57:46.280]  And albeit a more careful terms than before he stood by the construction of a border barrier
[03:57:46.520 --> 03:57:50.040]  Okay, meanwhile even npr says trump makes nice in mexico
[03:57:50.280 --> 03:57:54.200]  He struck his most presidential pose to date and then you got the hill
[03:57:54.680 --> 03:57:56.440]  pointing out that
[03:57:56.440 --> 03:57:59.160]  Everybody was saying he can't come back from this deficit, you know
[03:57:59.160 --> 03:58:05.000]  His former campaign manager manifold said, you know, we were never planning to win in august. We're planning to win
[03:58:05.480 --> 03:58:07.480]  in november and
[03:58:08.040 --> 03:58:10.040]  Even even william crystals says
[03:58:10.760 --> 03:58:15.400]  It's hard when you're a challenger to seem presidential trump standing there for all the awkwardness
[03:58:15.880 --> 03:58:21.560]  Looks presidential a good day for trump and hillary's former communication director said if you believe trump needed to pivot
[03:58:21.800 --> 03:58:23.160]  moderate look more
