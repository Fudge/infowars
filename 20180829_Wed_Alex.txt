[00:00.000 --> 00:07.120]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:07.120 --> 00:11.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:11.320 --> 00:15.840]  President Trump, we are almost to the halfway mark, and by all accounts you've got to double
[00:15.840 --> 00:16.840]  down.
[00:16.840 --> 00:22.240]  It's blatantly obvious to most Americans that Congress isn't a bipartisan democracy.
[00:22.240 --> 00:28.120]  Congress is actually two corporatic wolves fighting over what's for dinner.
[00:28.120 --> 00:33.080]  We see their culture of corruption, cronyism, and incompetence at work.
[00:33.080 --> 00:37.320]  People say it's because the Democratic Party, which you are a leader, has no message.
[00:37.320 --> 00:39.200]  Your only message is anti-Trump.
[00:39.200 --> 00:40.720]  No, that isn't true.
[00:40.720 --> 00:45.360]  First of all, let me just say, these are four races we would never have chosen to go into.
[00:45.360 --> 00:47.240]  They were chosen by Donald Trump.
[00:47.240 --> 00:52.560]  Please, God, let Nancy Pelosi continue to be the voice of the Democratic Party for the
[00:52.560 --> 00:57.360]  midterm elections, because it's the best thing that the Republicans could possibly
[00:57.360 --> 00:58.360]  have.
[00:58.360 --> 01:03.120]  And all we need to do is take her words, put it on television, and play it over and
[01:03.120 --> 01:04.120]  over again.
[01:04.120 --> 01:09.640]  The Democrats are already circulating a list of 100 potential investigations of the Trump
[01:09.640 --> 01:12.560]  presidency to fuel the frenzy in their base.
[01:12.560 --> 01:18.680]  Axios reports that some of the investigations based on requests for inquiries made by Democrats
[01:18.680 --> 01:24.480]  while in the minority include President Trump's tax returns, Trump family business, and whether
[01:24.480 --> 01:29.760]  they comply with the Constitution's emoluments clause, including the Chinese trademark grant
[01:29.760 --> 01:35.040]  to the Trump Organization, Trump's dealing with Russia, including the president's preparation
[01:35.040 --> 01:40.280]  for his meeting with Vladimir Putin, the payment to Stephanie Clifford, aka Stormy Daniels
[01:40.280 --> 01:46.000]  and James Comey's firing, the same monotone nothing burger investigations that have attempted
[01:46.000 --> 01:51.880]  to suck all of the air out of the first two years of the Trump presidency, but failed.
[01:51.880 --> 01:53.280]  Made in America is back.
[01:53.280 --> 01:57.720]  Now some people would say made in the USA, I personally don't care.
[01:57.720 --> 01:59.520]  The fact is we're back.
[01:59.520 --> 02:03.080]  We have 400,000 new manufacturing jobs.
[02:03.080 --> 02:05.360]  Our opponent said that could never happen.
[02:05.360 --> 02:09.160]  It has happened and we're going to develop a lot more in a very short period of time.
[02:09.160 --> 02:14.440]  So made in the USA, made in America, it's back.
[02:14.440 --> 02:19.160]  We all know they're simply trying to distract from the potential firing of Attorney General
[02:19.160 --> 02:24.720]  Jeff Sessions and Faisal Rat, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who have stalled on
[02:24.720 --> 02:30.880]  a motherload of investigations that could force a seismic shift in the district of criminals.
[02:30.880 --> 02:35.920]  Congress is now split into two camps, pro-America and pro-Deep State.
[02:35.920 --> 02:40.880]  The threat of Sessions firing brought the Deep State defenders out of the woodwork.
[02:40.880 --> 02:45.880]  Bizarrely, there are people in this body now talking like the Attorney General will be
[02:45.880 --> 02:47.560]  fired, should be fired.
[02:47.560 --> 02:51.280]  I'm not sure how to interpret the comments of the last couple of hours, but I guess
[02:51.280 --> 02:55.480]  I would just like to say as a member of the Judiciary Committee and as a member of this
[02:55.480 --> 03:01.560]  body, I find it really difficult to envision any circumstance where I would vote to confirm
[03:01.560 --> 03:08.440]  a successor to Jeff Sessions if he is fired because he's executing his job, Jeff Sessions.
[03:08.440 --> 03:09.840]  Would you try to help him with that?
[03:09.840 --> 03:16.760]  No, because he would have a nightmare on his hands in politics.
[03:16.760 --> 03:20.120]  It's very, very different in politics, Anna, than it is in business.
[03:20.120 --> 03:25.320]  If Jeff Sessions was the general counsel for the Trump Organization, it's a totally different
[03:25.320 --> 03:29.720]  set of personnel decisions than if Jeff Sessions is his cabinet member.
[03:29.720 --> 03:32.520]  And there are those that have begun to grow a spine.
[03:32.520 --> 03:37.080]  And I think there will come a time sooner rather than later where it will be time to
[03:37.080 --> 03:42.600]  have a new face and a fresh force at the Department of Justice replacing him before the election.
[03:42.600 --> 03:47.960]  To me, it would be a non-starter, but the idea of having a new Attorney General in the first
[03:47.960 --> 03:51.760]  term of the President Trump's administration, I think, is very likely.
[03:51.760 --> 03:58.120]  I understand the President inherited a system that likes to give no one anything.
[03:58.120 --> 04:04.680]  I often say that the most highly classified thing there is anywhere in Washington is embarrassment.
[04:04.680 --> 04:10.920]  This Attorney General, unfortunately, has been disengaged for his entire tenure as Attorney
[04:10.920 --> 04:17.560]  General with the exception of his work on bringing down the gangs and enforcing our immigration law.
[04:17.560 --> 04:21.080]  They have allowed all the crimes against Trump, all the crimes against America,
[04:21.080 --> 04:24.600]  all the illegal spying, all the illegal warrants, all the fake Russiagate garbage.
[04:24.600 --> 04:28.440]  They've indicted three members of the House to try to win the election for stuff that's
[04:28.440 --> 04:33.320]  not even criminal, flying their daughter's pet rabbit, buying members of the staff dinner
[04:33.320 --> 04:42.920]  on campaign funds, totally normal, when Obama laundered $84 million. It's all unfolding.
[04:44.120 --> 04:49.080]  As evidence on Hillary continues to pile up, like it recently did after judicial
[04:49.080 --> 04:54.600]  watch uncovered even more fumbling with our national security, it is abundantly clear
[04:54.600 --> 04:58.360]  there isn't any justice being... That's right, we'll be back. Stay with us.

[06:12.760 --> 06:16.760]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[06:16.760 --> 06:25.880]  As you've probably heard, recently many of the biggest tech companies joined in a coordinated
[06:25.880 --> 06:30.520]  effort to censor content from broadcaster Alex Jones. They're never going to remove him.
[06:30.520 --> 06:36.040]  That's crazy. That's too far. This isn't about Alex Jones. This is about freedom.
[06:36.760 --> 06:41.960]  Trump's election and Alex Jones's popularity are merely symptoms of a corrupt and failed status
[06:41.960 --> 06:49.320]  quo. You have about 800 million followers. That's why you're banned. Social media censorship.
[06:49.320 --> 06:54.520]  Virtually every day the big tech companies censor someone else whose political opinions they disagree
[06:54.520 --> 07:01.240]  with. Facebook censor office speech and saying all the ones that don't even see that we have been
[07:01.240 --> 07:05.720]  censored. For many on the left, the views seem to have become that if you can't beat them,
[07:05.720 --> 07:09.800]  prevent them from speaking. They broke their algorithm to try to steal the selection.
[07:09.800 --> 07:15.160]  Now they're down to the last corners of the internet. Oh no, conservatives can speak to
[07:15.160 --> 07:20.920]  one another. We must shut it up. People know what's true. They can smell it. You can't stop them from
[07:20.920 --> 07:29.400]  knowing that. This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas. U.S. resistance
[07:29.400 --> 07:33.800]  against a global corporate combine empowered and funded by Communist China, allied with the
[07:33.800 --> 07:39.800]  big megabanks that set up Communist China in 1949. The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S.
[07:39.800 --> 07:43.880]  telecommunications infrastructure. The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood. The
[07:43.880 --> 07:47.800]  Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities. This is all confirmed. This is not
[07:47.800 --> 07:52.520]  a drill. Big tech in Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[07:52.520 --> 07:57.480]  They've officially become state-run. Apple 100%. Google is now making the transition
[07:57.480 --> 08:02.760]  and announcing a merger in total worldwide censorship. They are now beta testing using
[08:02.760 --> 08:07.480]  me as the straw man. A demonized version of Alex Jones to do that. This is happening. This is not
[08:07.480 --> 08:12.280]  like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship, thinking you
[08:12.280 --> 08:17.640]  would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it. Now this attack is thousands and thousands
[08:17.640 --> 08:23.560]  and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous attacks. This is a titrated dose reverse
[08:23.560 --> 08:29.480]  psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome subversion paradigm manipulation.
[08:29.480 --> 08:34.760]  In layman's terms they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed. We adapt to
[08:34.760 --> 08:41.080]  being pressed with the low dosages of oppression. Now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover
[08:41.080 --> 08:47.240]  we try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing it's a lethal dose if we accept the
[08:47.240 --> 08:53.080]  dose. Total Internet of Things integration global social score complete command and control system.
[08:53.080 --> 08:58.920]  It is the virtual reality AI weapon system now attacking the United States with traders inside
[08:58.920 --> 09:03.800]  the major security agencies blocking Trump's resistance of the program and attempting to stop
[09:03.800 --> 09:09.000]  us from removing the tentacles of the chai comm slash big tech begging combine emergency situation.
[09:09.000 --> 09:13.160]  I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information and have been battering
[09:13.160 --> 09:18.840]  ramming it out as much as I can. They want to double use me as they always do in any complex
[09:18.840 --> 09:24.840]  system of mathematical deception where every angle of my good is turned against us. So they take what
[09:24.840 --> 09:30.200]  I've said being sincere build me into an insincere person in the straw man. I'm a person that cares
[09:30.200 --> 09:34.920]  about life and children and is against these wars and so they make me a herder of children and then
[09:34.920 --> 09:39.400]  they build me into this line to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring
[09:39.400 --> 09:45.480]  all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones. So even if I didn't sell out to them they now use me
[09:45.480 --> 09:52.120]  as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction. I have now been captured by the enemy
[09:52.120 --> 09:57.320]  in the information warfare fulcrum has been used against you only your full understanding of this
[09:57.320 --> 10:03.480]  team will break you free from this paradigm. I have given you the transmission now break free.
[10:07.080 --> 10:14.680]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the
[10:14.680 --> 10:23.240]  mind of man. Thomas Jefferson. 69 days. 69 days. Huge breaking news coming up but first this is
[10:23.240 --> 10:30.440]  why they hate us. This is why they want to shut us down. Certainly for some Alex Jones can be scary
[10:30.440 --> 10:43.560]  and abrasive. But if you can get through all that to explore what he's been saying to see for
[10:43.560 --> 10:49.480]  yourself what it is that the establishment wants to hide from you and the information you find
[10:50.040 --> 10:57.480]  could be life changing. He predicted 9-11. And if there was an outside threat like a Ben Laden who
[10:57.480 --> 11:02.680]  was a known CIA asset in the 80s he's the boogeyman they need and this were welly and phony system.
[11:02.680 --> 11:06.680]  He exposed the cremation of care ceremony at Bohemian Grove.
[11:06.680 --> 11:18.120]  He educated us about the relationship between the third Reich and modern
[11:18.120 --> 11:24.120]  globalist prison planet dominated by a ruthless gang of control freaks. He helped reveal the so
[11:24.120 --> 11:29.000]  called Bilderberg group at all. And most of you are a bunch of stinking parasites.
[11:29.000 --> 11:36.200]  He was the loudest voice reporting on the union between the communist Chinese and Silicon Valley.
[11:38.680 --> 11:45.080]  They falsely edited him. They lie about his reporting of Sandy Hook.
[11:46.520 --> 11:50.040]  They lie that he pushed a child down in a viral video.
[11:50.040 --> 11:57.080]  And now he is being deplatformed by Facebook, Apple and Google.
[11:58.600 --> 12:03.320]  Private companies are being harassed and encouraged to stop doing business with him.
[12:03.320 --> 12:05.560]  And then we get hit and say you no longer use our software.
[12:06.760 --> 12:10.040]  YouTubers are being censored for talking about him.
[12:10.040 --> 12:12.600]  We just got taken down by YouTube. They just killed our stream.
[12:13.720 --> 12:14.520]  Really? Yep.
[12:14.520 --> 12:17.160]  And some Americans are actually celebrating this.
[12:17.160 --> 12:21.160]  This is America in 2018.
[12:23.000 --> 12:28.520]  Will you sit by and allow liberty and freedom to be taken away right before your eyes?
[12:30.680 --> 12:36.840]  Will you do nothing while history is being recorded? Will you sit and do nothing?
[12:38.360 --> 12:44.600]  Or will you do your own research, discover the truth and stand for freedom?
[12:44.600 --> 12:50.600]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[13:14.760 --> 13:18.840]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[13:18.840 --> 13:22.600]  I'm standing in this briefing room right now. There is no government official here.
[13:22.600 --> 13:26.600]  But I'll say that the press is not the enemy of the people.
[13:37.960 --> 13:41.480]  But I'll say that the press is not the enemy of the people.
[13:41.480 --> 13:45.480]  The press is not the enemy of the people.
[13:45.480 --> 13:47.480]  The press is not the enemy of the people.
[13:47.480 --> 13:49.480]  They came in peace.
[13:49.480 --> 14:09.480]  Maybe we should go out on Pennsylvania Avenue.
[14:10.040 --> 14:13.640]  Like these folks who chant CNN sucks and fake news.
[14:13.640 --> 14:17.880]  Maybe we should go out. All journalists should go out on Pennsylvania Avenue
[14:17.880 --> 14:19.880]  and chant, we're not the enemy of the people.
[14:31.160 --> 14:33.880]  We're not the enemy of the people. We're not the enemy of the people.
[14:33.880 --> 14:42.840]  We're not the enemy of the people.
[14:42.840 --> 14:49.840]  This is CNN, and this is the Info War.
[14:51.840 --> 14:58.840]  Paul Watson has done something very, very special that he and I worked on yesterday that he hammered out this morning.
[14:58.840 --> 15:02.840]  And if you want to win the war against the globalists, if you want to defeat the New World Order,
[15:02.840 --> 15:05.840]  you want to flood every talk show with this, you want to flood the White House,
[15:05.840 --> 15:10.840]  you want to flood every member of Congress and every member of your state legislature.
[15:10.840 --> 15:12.840]  It is now being reported by Politico.
[15:12.840 --> 15:17.840]  The President is looking at Sherman Antitrust Act Section 2.
[15:17.840 --> 15:22.840]  Unfair trade practices, discrimination, racketeering.
[15:22.840 --> 15:25.840]  Oh, and I forgot, lying to Congress.
[15:25.840 --> 15:29.840]  They had the Presidents and Vice Presidents of the tech companies said that no one's being shadow banned.
[15:29.840 --> 15:33.840]  We have executives from those companies caught on tape saying it is,
[15:33.840 --> 15:37.840]  and I'm told more tapes are coming out,
[15:37.840 --> 15:40.840]  but everyone held back so they could lie to Congress.
[15:40.840 --> 15:42.840]  Reports on InfoWars.com.
[15:42.840 --> 15:44.840]  Oh, and it's coffin nails to tyranny.
[15:44.840 --> 15:48.840]  The social media purge of conservatives is a giant election meddling scheme.
[15:48.840 --> 15:52.840]  If you want to defeat the globalist, you go to InfoWars.com
[15:52.840 --> 16:18.840]  and you hammer this report out to the four corners of this planet.
[16:23.840 --> 16:25.840]  It's like the one you're listening to.
[16:25.840 --> 16:53.840]  It's like the one you're listening to.

[17:41.840 --> 17:45.840]  to deliver both alkaline and antioxidant water anywhere you want it.
[17:45.840 --> 17:48.840]  Alkaline water is healthier, tastes better and can even boost energy.

[18:26.840 --> 18:30.840]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later,
[18:30.840 --> 18:34.840]  we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet
[18:34.840 --> 18:37.840]  that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[18:37.840 --> 18:41.840]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine.
[18:41.840 --> 18:46.840]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase,
[18:46.840 --> 18:51.840]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[18:51.840 --> 18:54.840]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.

[20:23.840 --> 20:26.840]  Sixty-nine days, ladies and gentlemen.
[20:26.840 --> 20:31.840]  Sixty-nine days until the most important election in world history.
[20:31.840 --> 20:33.840]  The planet is at a crossroads.
[20:33.840 --> 20:34.840]  It is undoubted.
[20:34.840 --> 20:37.840]  The globals are trying to shut this nation down.
[20:37.840 --> 20:42.840]  We are struggling as hard as we can to expose their operations.
[20:42.840 --> 20:45.840]  It is a neck and neck battle, ladies and gentlemen.
[20:45.840 --> 20:47.840]  Neck and neck.
[20:47.840 --> 20:54.840]  All right. Coming up next segment, I am going to get into information
[20:54.840 --> 20:58.840]  that is just staggeringly important to the future of this country
[20:58.840 --> 21:02.840]  and at winning these midterms and the fact that the Democrats are trying to manipulate
[21:02.840 --> 21:06.840]  the outcome of the election.
[21:06.840 --> 21:09.840]  And I'm going to go through the fact that we should be rejoicing
[21:09.840 --> 21:15.840]  that it's an amazing, amazing time to be alive right now
[21:15.840 --> 21:23.840]  in that Trump is awake to the censorship, to the total attack on our free civilization,
[21:23.840 --> 21:26.840]  and it's fighting back, and you're fighting back in this broadcast
[21:26.840 --> 21:28.840]  and dredgereport.com.
[21:28.840 --> 21:32.840]  This broadcast, our audience who are activists and dredgereport.com,
[21:32.840 --> 21:39.840]  we're the only group in a prominent way in the last year
[21:39.840 --> 21:41.840]  showing how InfoWars was being set up for takedown
[21:41.840 --> 21:45.840]  and that everybody else would be taken down right after us, which is now happening.
[21:45.840 --> 21:49.840]  So thank God for that, and our prayers are definitely being answered,
[21:49.840 --> 21:52.840]  but God helps those that help themselves, so thank you all.
[21:52.840 --> 21:55.840]  We're not over the hump yet, but we are rolling this boulder up
[21:55.840 --> 21:59.840]  and you can see the top. I mean, this is a big, big deal.
[21:59.840 --> 22:03.840]  The main article I'm going to read is on infowars.com.
[22:03.840 --> 22:09.840]  The social media person conservatives is a giant election meddling scheme.
[22:09.840 --> 22:13.840]  Now, I know you know that, but the public is slow to pick up on this,
[22:13.840 --> 22:17.840]  and it's massive, it's coordinated, and they've all perjured themselves to Congress
[22:17.840 --> 22:22.840]  because we have the WikiLeaks with Facebook and Google colluding for Hillary
[22:22.840 --> 22:24.840]  and saying they delivered the election to her.
[22:24.840 --> 22:27.840]  And then we have them lying about shadow banning and lying about everything else,
[22:27.840 --> 22:30.840]  and they're still doing it.
[22:30.840 --> 22:34.840]  And now the CEO of Google is refusing to testify, so that's all coming up.
[22:34.840 --> 22:38.840]  But first, I didn't get to this yesterday, so I want to air it now because it's important.
[22:38.840 --> 22:42.840]  It's Mark Penn, political strategist and pollster,
[22:42.840 --> 22:46.840]  warned Silicon Valley censorship to have big influence on the elections.
[22:46.840 --> 22:50.840]  You're like, that's Tucker Carlson. You're like, Alex, we know this.
[22:50.840 --> 22:54.840]  I know, but the president watches Tucker Carlson, it's having an effect,
[22:54.840 --> 22:56.840]  and now the media is trying to spin it.
[22:56.840 --> 22:59.840]  The controlled media that Trump's crazy, that's the CNN headline here today,
[22:59.840 --> 23:05.840]  Trump conspiracy theory thinks the news is gamed and Google manipulates search results.
[23:05.840 --> 23:11.840]  The first 20, 30, 40 pages are nothing, but anti-Trump, anti-Alex Jones, anti-America,
[23:11.840 --> 23:14.840]  anti-… telling us the economy isn't good, you name it.
[23:14.840 --> 23:16.840]  I mean, it's crazy.
[23:16.840 --> 23:20.840]  And the president is absolutely right about this in a big way.
[23:20.840 --> 23:25.840]  There is debunking Donald Trump's latest conspiracy theory on Google.
[23:25.840 --> 23:28.840]  Even CNN reporters that have called for me and everybody else to be banned,
[23:28.840 --> 23:32.840]  that they don't agree with, then the same reporter the next day writes articles saying,
[23:32.840 --> 23:35.840]  we're insane, it doesn't exist.
[23:35.840 --> 23:45.840]  To just change the subject back onto is it true, is it happening?
[23:45.840 --> 23:48.840]  Remember all the years, oh, there's no world government,
[23:48.840 --> 23:52.840]  oh, there's no plan to break up the family, there's no plan to do this and that,
[23:52.840 --> 23:54.840]  and then you'd have all their documents, all their admissions,
[23:54.840 --> 23:58.840]  you'd have them at UN meetings admitting it, EU meetings.
[23:58.840 --> 24:01.840]  It's crazy.
[24:01.840 --> 24:04.840]  I mean, this is like going to the zoo and you see an elephant and you go,
[24:04.840 --> 24:07.840]  there's an elephant and your parents go, no, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[24:07.840 --> 24:14.840]  You're like, well, that's big ears, that's a trunk, it's gray, it's walking around, it's big.
[24:14.840 --> 24:16.840]  That looks like a tiger over there, it's got black and orange stripes
[24:16.840 --> 24:23.840]  and weighs 1,000 pounds or whatever and you're like, nope, nope, it's not a tiger.
[24:23.840 --> 24:27.840]  Go ahead and climb in there and grab by the tail and see what happens.
[24:27.840 --> 24:29.840]  But I want to play this Tucker Carlson piece right now,
[24:29.840 --> 24:33.840]  really uninterrupted because it's so important, here it is.
[24:33.840 --> 24:38.840]  I'm fascinated by the Alex Jones story because it was Alex Jones.
[24:38.840 --> 24:42.840]  Almost no conservatist rose to his defense because the idea was, well, Alex Jones, ew, yuck.
[24:42.840 --> 24:44.840]  It's not really about Alex Jones, is it?
[24:44.840 --> 24:49.840]  It's about the idea that companies can make it impossible for your voice to be heard.
[24:49.840 --> 24:51.840]  Is that a precedent we should be comfortable with?
[24:51.840 --> 24:55.840]  Well, I really think you have to be worried about big tech becoming big brother.
[24:55.840 --> 24:59.840]  Yes, because these used to be neutral platforms that said,
[24:59.840 --> 25:03.840]  we're open to free expression, that's our core value.
[25:03.840 --> 25:05.840]  And now they've said, well, not so much.
[25:05.840 --> 25:11.840]  With particularly Facebook hiring 10,000 new censors on top of another 10,000
[25:11.840 --> 25:14.840]  and having roving, censoring bots looking for content.
[25:14.840 --> 25:16.840]  Look, I never read Alex Jones.
[25:16.840 --> 25:21.840]  But here's somebody with millions of followers, publicly accountable for his speech,
[25:21.840 --> 25:26.840]  operating within Supreme Court standards, yanked from the media.
[25:26.840 --> 25:27.840]  That's a surprise to me.
[25:27.840 --> 25:32.840]  That says that these platforms are no longer as open as they presented themselves to be.
[25:32.840 --> 25:33.840]  And it's not just him.
[25:33.840 --> 25:36.840]  There are many like him who've been yanked, lesser known.
[25:36.840 --> 25:38.840]  But still, so this has political implications.
[25:38.840 --> 25:41.840]  You ran and managed campaigns for so long.
[25:41.840 --> 25:43.840]  This must have occurred.
[25:43.840 --> 25:47.840]  A lot of our political debate takes place on social media platforms.
[25:47.840 --> 25:51.840]  So if they clamp down on one side of the debate, why wouldn't that influence an election's outcome?
[25:51.840 --> 25:54.840]  Well, obviously it could have a big influence on elections.
[25:54.840 --> 25:59.840]  Increasingly because where people turn for their news is that they look at the news feeds
[25:59.840 --> 26:02.840]  that are run by the major social media companies.
[26:02.840 --> 26:06.840]  And so they're more powerful than any TV station, more powerful than Fox.
[26:06.840 --> 26:07.840]  Yes, they are.
[26:07.840 --> 26:09.840]  Because of the amount of time that people spend.
[26:09.840 --> 26:10.840]  And it's a funnel.
[26:10.840 --> 26:13.840]  So if you're not at the top, you don't get seen.
[26:13.840 --> 26:17.840]  And so in the past, they had some neutral ways of doing this.
[26:17.840 --> 26:23.840]  But now they've increasingly applied still more mysterious algorithms plus individual sensors.
[26:23.840 --> 26:29.840]  And remember, their private platforms, they say, so they're not, they're not actually subject to the First Amendment
[26:29.840 --> 26:34.840]  unless we get some legislation here that says free speech is an internet right.
[26:34.840 --> 26:35.840]  It's totally meaningless.
[26:35.840 --> 26:43.840]  If I own a toll road, I can't say any one of a certain race can drive on my toll road.
[26:43.840 --> 26:46.840]  And so they're not actually fully private companies.
[26:46.840 --> 26:50.840]  We have a public interest, I would say, in keeping them free and open.
[26:50.840 --> 26:54.840]  Why aren't, if you cared about the integrity of our elections, why isn't Congress acting?
[26:54.840 --> 26:56.840]  I don't know why Congress isn't acting.
[26:56.840 --> 27:04.840]  Part of it is because to stand up to a social media company means you could have five million people on your doorstep the next day.
[27:04.840 --> 27:10.840]  So I think there's been a lot of intimidation in Congress instead of bipartisan agreement that, hey,
[27:10.840 --> 27:16.840]  we cannot have this kind of regulation of speech where whoever runs one of the big platforms can pick out speech,
[27:16.840 --> 27:18.840]  which speech goes and which speech doesn't.
[27:18.840 --> 27:24.840]  Not when they've been exempted from the libel laws, when they've been set up as open platforms,
[27:24.840 --> 27:27.840]  and they now become media companies instead.
[27:27.840 --> 27:29.840]  And that's exactly what's happened.
[27:29.840 --> 27:37.840]  They become media companies that take ads on the media that they run, and they have editors and algorithms and bots that run it.
[27:37.840 --> 27:44.840]  I really believe that 10 years from now, this segment, what you just said will be seen as pression.
[27:44.840 --> 27:48.840]  I think it's a big story that's being ignored by virtually everyone for reasons I don't fully understand.
[27:48.840 --> 27:51.840]  Maybe you're right, it's cowardice, but it shouldn't be.
[27:51.840 --> 27:56.840]  Mark Penn is a former top strategist for the Clintons, and he's a classical liberal.
[27:56.840 --> 28:00.840]  You heard him say, Jones is held to the standard. You can take him to court.
[28:00.840 --> 28:04.840]  But he's being selectively hit, and it's setting the precedent where they have their cake and eat it, too.
[28:04.840 --> 28:08.840]  They say they're a big platform, like a commons.
[28:08.840 --> 28:10.840]  They say they're a monopoly.
[28:10.840 --> 28:13.840]  They're given that protection under federal law.
[28:13.840 --> 28:17.840]  The Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Safe Harbor, DMCA, a bunch of other things.
[28:17.840 --> 28:19.840]  I know I live under it within FullWars.com.
[28:19.840 --> 28:23.840]  We're commenters on the FullWars. I'm not libel for what they say.
[28:23.840 --> 28:26.840]  So they're now, though, having their cake and eat it, too.
[28:26.840 --> 28:30.840]  And they're having all these former Democrats come in and censor and control.
[28:30.840 --> 28:35.840]  Then what they do is they build a straw man of what I've said, that, ooh, it's this Alex Jones. Yuck, he's a bad guy.
[28:35.840 --> 28:40.840]  And then smother the real Alex Jones so I can't respond to what they're doing.
[28:40.840 --> 28:43.840]  And as Tucker said, what you just heard was pure veritas.
[28:43.840 --> 28:49.840]  That's what's going on, and it can deliver 5 million votes easily to the Democrats and steal these elections
[28:49.840 --> 28:54.840]  for the illegal aliens, folks voting on the names of dead people. This is the 2018 issue.
[28:54.840 --> 29:20.840]  If Trump doesn't get on top of this, we're going to lose.
[29:24.840 --> 29:40.840]  We're good old fashioned comfort. Get Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[29:40.840 --> 29:45.840]  Every stitch guaranteed. And our Defender motorcycle gene comes Kevlar reinforced.

[31:59.840 --> 32:08.840]  We knew it was coming. The whole thing was for me leg. First demonize Info Wars, lie about us, build a straw man, then sue us to add credibility to that,
[32:08.840 --> 32:15.840]  then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia.
[32:15.840 --> 32:26.840]  And then voila, two weeks later ban Info Wars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all in the top five or top ten news feeds.
[32:26.840 --> 32:35.840]  Go to infowars.com forward slash show, subscribe to the free podcast, just click on the link, whatever you're subscribing to your podcast in, it'll pop up there.
[32:35.840 --> 32:45.840]  It's also critical to go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter and give us your emails so that we can stay in contact with you and send you videos and articles on our own platform.
[32:45.840 --> 32:52.840]  But whatever you do, tell folks about infowars.com forward slash show, how they can download the free Android and iPhone apps,
[32:52.840 --> 32:59.840]  how they can then reach out to others with the information and point out this is the verboten info. This is what they don't want you to see.
[33:02.840 --> 33:05.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:05.840 --> 33:07.840]  Alex Jones.
[33:35.840 --> 33:48.840]  The tree to the ground and shut it from the sound. The death machine ain't slowing down. It's gaining powerful power.
[33:48.840 --> 34:09.840]  All right. There's a way to beat the globalist, but people have to be serious. They have to be adults. They have to know what's going on.
[34:09.840 --> 34:28.840]  And they have to understand the true criminal nature of the Democrats and the foreign corporations and the communist Chinese that empower them. These are the most psychotic, sociopathic, vicious, hateful, dishonorable, dishonest, truly wicked people who hate America
[34:28.840 --> 34:35.840]  and hate your family and just viciously have a total will to dominate and run your life.
[34:35.840 --> 34:46.840]  They are eugenicist to destroy the family, to make you totally depressed, to take everything away from you and then put you into a virtual reality where they can steal your soul.
[34:46.840 --> 34:52.840]  They are completely turned over to what can only be called the devil.
[34:52.840 --> 35:07.840]  Whether you believe in that as a spiritual force or an archetype, it's real. It's going on. They're setting a world government plan. They're bringing in a one world government mark of the beast with digital control where if you don't play by their rules you have a world social score
[35:07.840 --> 35:21.840]  and then you are devalued on that social score until you starve to death on the street and everyone else shuns you through peer pressure and you starve to death.
[35:21.840 --> 35:27.840]  That is now being announced by Facebook that they are launching the communist Chinese social score.
[35:27.840 --> 35:40.840]  I was the first person in modern history on a wide scale who was prominent to be shadow banned and to have the western governments promoted as a good thing and then to be completely deperson.
[35:40.840 --> 35:58.840]  First they demonized me to set the precedent, to build a straw man to get you to go along with it so that you would shun me and then as soon as within a week and a half of people not raising a big alarm except for Matt Drudge and Tucker Carlson and the president
[35:58.840 --> 36:13.840]  it happened to tens of thousands of prominent people and now it's being reported millions of conservatives, libertarians, nationalists. You can't say something pro-Trump. You can't say something pro-gun. You can't say something pro-America.
[36:13.840 --> 36:33.840]  Night circuits ruled you can't wear American flags in public schools on the west coast. They mean business across every level. So they're here. The mark of the beast is now here.
[36:33.840 --> 36:47.840]  World government is now here in your face with a scientific one world system using a digital mark of your internet ID that will be biometrically based on face scans and hand scans.
[36:47.840 --> 36:56.840]  Mark of the head, mark of the hand. Two thousand years later, coming true. No one can deny it. Prophecy is being fulfilled.
[36:56.840 --> 37:07.840]  And it also says the church will fall away and will accept the mark of the beast. Most people will accept the mark of the beast because they'll believe that it isn't actually happening.
[37:07.840 --> 37:25.840]  Because the churches aren't churches. They've been federalized. They've been globalized. They've been put under 501c3 so they won't tell you. In fact, I predict soon the people will be taking communion and giving to the offering plate with a hand scan.
[37:25.840 --> 37:34.840]  Mark my words. Within two years, you will see people. In fact, I bet it's already going on. I never thought of that.
[37:34.840 --> 37:43.840]  The church engine, church takes digital payments with biometrics. The people will go into church and they'll go just like at the airport. Everyone's being conditioned to do it.
[37:43.840 --> 37:50.840]  Sweden now to get on public transit, people are taking microchips to get on buses and trains. Soon they're saying that's the only way you'll be allowed to get honest with that.
[37:50.840 --> 38:00.840]  Oh, it stops all the crime. Oh, it's a great thing. ABC News, CBS News, NBC News are all, hey, everyone will soon have a mark.
[38:00.840 --> 38:06.840]  Everyone will soon have to put down their hand or have a face scan to buy or sell.
[38:06.840 --> 38:12.840]  Facebook is using face scanning for a decade now all over the country to tie it into your bank account to control everything.
[38:12.840 --> 38:31.840]  Google, the driverless cars, robots making hamburgers, robots killing lionfish in the Mediterranean, killing lionfish in the Caribbean, robots doing everything.
[38:31.840 --> 38:42.840]  This is the program. This is the operation.
[38:42.840 --> 38:52.840]  Oh, there it is, three ways churches can use biometrics to increase security. Oh, okay, I'm sorry. They've got them to get in the door and they've got them to make their payments.
[38:52.840 --> 39:00.840]  So sure enough, I guess they're giving their offering plates up with that system.
[39:00.840 --> 39:05.840]  So that's what's going on here, ladies and gentlemen. That's what's happening.
[39:05.840 --> 39:11.840]  And everything you do is already tracked and it's beyond Big Brother.
[39:11.840 --> 39:22.840]  Now you can have world leaders in the future projected 20, 30, 50 feet high in town's commons as giant holograms speaking to you and telling you about the world government.
[39:22.840 --> 39:33.840]  The Bible says there'll be 20 and 30 foot holograms in the world capitals in Jerusalem, in Rome, in other areas of the world leader and the beast.
[39:33.840 --> 39:40.840]  This is this logo creature that's described like a machine, basically like Megatron.
[39:40.840 --> 39:48.840]  So the Bible described this big metal angel creature will be projected everywhere in the world at the same time and will tell you to submit.
[39:48.840 --> 39:52.840]  It'll have all the high technology, life extension. It'll have everything.
[39:52.840 --> 40:02.840]  You've just got to get down and worship it and accept its politics and do what it says and it's going to watch you omnipresently artificially with the tech to make sure you submit.
[40:02.840 --> 40:08.840]  And if you don't submit, well, you'll be downgraded and at first it'll be easy to get a five star.
[40:08.840 --> 40:14.840]  You don't have to do much, but soon it'll be more and more and more than very few will have five stars.
[40:14.840 --> 40:19.840]  It'll be totally coveted, the new Hollywood power. Even world leaders won't have five stars.
[40:19.840 --> 40:27.840]  Oh, the people that do will be like Dalai Lama like people. Worshiped.
[40:27.840 --> 40:33.840]  Oh, you want that five star, don't you? Because if you don't have it, you'll be cut off from the entertainment, jobs, everything.
[40:33.840 --> 40:40.840]  This is their system. And we've been warned thousands of years ago.
[40:40.840 --> 40:47.840]  If you read Ezekiel and you read Daniel and you read Revelation, all written within 3,000 years of themselves.
[40:47.840 --> 40:55.840]  Ezekiel says these big rings of fire come down in land and these dudes with blue helmets on, that's how it's described in the Hebrew, come off and they tell them.
[40:55.840 --> 41:01.840]  They say, take this and then they take this thing they're told and then it downloads all the information into them.
[41:01.840 --> 41:06.840]  They all said the same thing. World government, marks in the hands, marks in the head, don't take it.
[41:06.840 --> 41:09.840]  Once you all get rigged up to this, it's going to start exterminating everybody.
[41:09.840 --> 41:13.840]  Well, let's just say the Bible's not true.
[41:13.840 --> 41:20.840]  I'm not saying that, but just for the sake of argument, what is it then? Because it's being built.
[41:20.840 --> 41:32.840]  Now, let me just throw this in here. For now, you can still go to m4warstore.com if they're trying to take our payment processors and bankrupt us and shut us down and sue us into oblivion with fake lawsuits.

[41:54.840 --> 42:05.840]  And so we just want to be strong through the finish, whatever God's plan is, and that means capital to continue on and expand because if we don't expand, we'll be contracting and then they're winning.

[47:20.840 --> 47:38.840]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[47:38.840 --> 47:50.840]  You know, I don't like to speak yellow the dead, but I've been on air for 24 years, been on radio for 23, and I have been following John McCain's evil career.
[47:50.840 --> 48:00.840]  The open borders, the gun control, the lying, the swindling SNLs, the funding ISIS al-Qaeda, covering up for the Clintons, just a monstrous person.
[48:00.840 --> 48:13.840]  And he's everything wrong with this country, horrible blue blood neocon of the very worst ilk, his father, his grandfather, horrible corrupt people, all involved in big swindling scandals.
[48:13.840 --> 48:24.840]  McCain comes from a crime family. I know his last name isn't, you know, Capone, but it's unbelievable.
[48:24.840 --> 48:37.840]  And they just, during the break, I was back in the break room, getting a glass of water, and they had him from 2012 going, when you malign someone and say bad things about them, it's wrong, you should never do it.
[48:37.840 --> 48:47.840]  He was always there to make sure corruption could continue on. And he'd cuss at people and tell them to go to hell and all these things, and that's not the real reason he was a bad guy.
[48:47.840 --> 49:02.840]  The guy was famously an out-of-control egomaniac tyrant who would then say, remember a couple years ago, he said to Rand Paul, you're a Russian agent because you're not voting to expand war in Ukraine.
[49:02.840 --> 49:09.840]  He said, I call for that senator to be investigated as a Russian agent. I mean, give me a break, McCain. You're covered up for Hillary.
[49:09.840 --> 49:19.840]  You're covered up for her and Uranium One and Mueller with the tarmac meetings. You people are sick freaks.
[49:19.840 --> 49:27.840]  And then the Democrats always hated him before, until they were worshiping Obama publicly. They didn't realize he was a shill for them all along.
[49:27.840 --> 49:37.840]  And I am just so sick of everyone fawning after him and like, oh, saying great things about him. It's a lie.
[49:37.840 --> 49:43.840]  So McCain's spirit has gone wherever it's gone. I'm not glad he died. I don't wish any ill upon him.
[49:43.840 --> 49:53.840]  But man, it's getting really, really sick. You know, in the whole mainstream media, in the whole culture, in Hollywood worship, you know you're a bad guy.
[49:53.840 --> 50:01.840]  What did Christ say? All those that hate me love death. And if you love me, the world's going to hate you.
[50:01.840 --> 50:09.840]  That doesn't mean I'm on some high horse, that I'm some preacher, I'm some Pharisee telling you, you know, if you've done this or that, you're going to hell. God judges the heart.
[50:09.840 --> 50:16.840]  I'm simply talking about good and evil and the fact that if you're trying to be a good person and really help other people and really tell the truth,
[50:16.840 --> 50:21.840]  instead of just virtue signaling like these monsters do, the world will come after you.
[50:21.840 --> 50:24.840]  So if the world loves you, you know you're doing bad.
[50:24.840 --> 50:35.840]  If the establishment, we talk about the world, we mean Bill Clinton, Peter Strock, Harvey Weinstein, Queen Elizabeth II.
[50:35.840 --> 50:46.840]  I mean, when those folks like you and everything's beautiful and everything's nice and you're all around these other fake people, you're losing your soul.
[50:46.840 --> 50:57.840]  Now, I do want to take the calls again today. I'm going to be doing that coming up later in the next hour. And I do have a ton of clips and news that I haven't even gotten to yet that is of extreme importance.
[50:57.840 --> 51:06.840]  But I've been hammering for several months internet censorship ahead of the midterms. I've been hammering it because I believe it was the central issue and no one was really talking about it.
[51:06.840 --> 51:16.840]  Thanks. Again, keep going back to this because it's so critical to DrudgeReport.com and you, the audience, and I mean that equally to Matt Drudge and to the audience. Thank you all.
[51:16.840 --> 51:25.840]  We really appreciate you being smart, having common sense, standing up yourself and us and having self preservation instincts. So thank God you're not cowards as well.
[51:25.840 --> 51:35.840]  So it is this audience. It is this crew in this building. It is you, the supporters of this broadcast. It's our local AM and FM stations, UHF, VHF and Cable.
[51:35.840 --> 51:45.840]  You are the reason we were able to punch this story out. I was de-platformed for it. I was the first person on a large scale, unpersoned.
[51:45.840 --> 51:54.840]  And I'm quite frankly not glad it happened, but I'm proud it happened because I'm so effective and you're so effective and we're so effective together this happened.
[51:54.840 --> 52:01.840]  And now it is the big story. I said I'd get to it this segment last, but I went into some other issues. I got into McCain this segment.
[52:01.840 --> 52:09.840]  I will start at the next hour, get into this huge group of incredibly positive news.
[52:09.840 --> 52:18.840]  Trump is looking at Sherman Antitrust Act Section 2. He's looking at tech giants perjury to Congress.
[52:18.840 --> 52:27.840]  He's also looking at the WikiLeaks and their own admissions that they're working with the Democrats and quote that Facebook and Twitter are quote owned by the Democratic Party.
[52:27.840 --> 52:35.840]  Those are statements that they're owned by them. And that's them talking to each other. Oh, you know, you own us. You know, we're 100% behind you.
[52:35.840 --> 52:45.840]  And we already saw the censorship two years ago, almost two years ago. We already saw that and witnessed it all.
[52:45.840 --> 52:51.840]  And so people have to understand that it's on. And so you've done a great job.
[52:51.840 --> 53:01.840]  But if you really want to get this to every talk show host, you know, and just fill the inbox of Congress, go to your congressman or woman's meetings when they're back in the district,
[53:01.840 --> 53:13.840]  which many of them are right now campaigning and hand them this report and say, listen, I know you get handed a lot of stuff, but whoever stands up for this is going to save the country, win the midterms and be a hero.
[53:13.840 --> 53:24.840]  I had Matt Gates briefed right before he had those hearings and I said, if you green light and say you're just private companies, do whatever you want, they're going to totally start censoring right after.
[53:24.840 --> 53:30.840]  Gates didn't listen. Now he says he's wrong and I'll leave it at that. That's good.
[53:30.840 --> 53:41.840]  But I mean, Gates would have been presidential material if he would have been the champion upfront and then Trump picking it up, he'd just be movie star level, which is great.
[53:41.840 --> 53:48.840]  These guys don't listen. Daddy's a billionaire, you know, Gates is a smart guy, but daddy kind of got him the seat and everything.
[53:48.840 --> 53:54.840]  And so he doesn't need to listen to, you know, Jones from Texas when, you know, Roger Stone briefs him on stuff or we get him information.
[53:54.840 --> 54:03.840]  Now I might be an arrogant. I just want to win. Now Gates is like, you're right, I was wrong. Well, well, good Gates. I'm glad you know that now.
[54:03.840 --> 54:06.840]  So they got more hearings coming up next month.
[54:06.840 --> 54:22.840]  Don't play patty cake with these trillion dollar companies. They are absolutely gutting this country up one side and down the other and engaged in racketeering and Sherman antitrust act violations and unfair trade practices and fraud and discrimination and just anything.
[54:22.840 --> 54:34.840]  I mean, it's, it's, I've had top law firms look at it with all their own admissions and Senator Warner, Mark Warner and Senator Wyden and Senator Murphy's admissions in this stay behind office.
[54:34.840 --> 54:46.840]  You know, like the office of the post office pretty big, huh? Obama set up an office under the Defense Authorization Act 2017, the John Warner Defense Authorization Act named after the former senator, not the current one.
[54:46.840 --> 54:54.840]  And they lay the whole plan to shut everybody down and take over. People keep asking Jones, how do you have the Pentagon call me up and others.
[54:54.840 --> 55:01.840]  They say, Jones, how are you continually? How do you know all this? And I'm like, they're writing white papers. They're writing white papers.
[55:01.840 --> 55:12.840]  Do all of you people just pretend you do research? I talked to generals. I talked to former CIA section chiefs. I'm not bragging and like, I know more than they do.
[55:12.840 --> 55:19.840]  You know why? Because they're taking care of their grandkids and their kids or they're playing golf and they just kind of, you know, bitch, you complain and watch Fox News.
[55:19.840 --> 55:29.840]  Man, I'm not doing that. Okay. Matt Drudge isn't doing that. Matt Drudge has been running his own operations for 20 something years. He's built it himself. He knows how things work.
[55:29.840 --> 55:36.840]  Show do I. Matt Drudge has all the sources in the Supreme Court, the White House, foreign governments. Matt Drudge is a world traveler.
[55:36.840 --> 55:42.840]  I'll leave it at that. He knows. Let me tell you, I don't want to be the only one up here with Matt Drudge that knows all this.
[55:42.840 --> 55:47.840]  It's very frustrating. Breitbart's starting to get it with their computer scientists and top folks. A lot of lawyers are getting.
[55:47.840 --> 55:54.840]  You heard former head Clinton strategist earlier with Tucker Carlson and going, no, this is a total takeover. They're going to steal the election.
[55:54.840 --> 56:04.840]  Republicans ought to be really concerned. I mean, they can deliver with just a couple days of Facebook turned over to Democrats, 5 million extra votes.
[56:04.840 --> 56:11.840]  And that's the counter, the huge Republican red wave tsunami. They're panicked by that. The red waves coming in.
[56:11.840 --> 56:19.840]  So they're trying to totally up the censorship. And you know, double voting and everything else to counter that. And it's not going to work.
[56:19.840 --> 56:28.840]  But Trump had a huge wave in 2016, but they had such election fraud and stole at least six states that the wave almost hit the seawall and almost didn't go over.
[56:28.840 --> 56:35.840]  But some did. And just that little bit turned the country back around.
[56:35.840 --> 56:41.840]  So, and by the way, the left all brags how they control everything.
[56:41.840 --> 56:49.840]  So it's on. And now that Trump spotlighted it, they go, oh, that's insane. It's a conspiracy theory. It's crazy. So the articles on info wars dot com. Get out to everybody.
[56:49.840 --> 56:59.840]  The social media purge of conservatives is a giant election meddling scheme. We're going to add a few of my videos that I've been breaking this down on as well into that.
[56:59.840 --> 57:04.840]  We have an emergency briefing with the president from Saturday. That's probably good to add that on Twitter.
[57:04.840 --> 57:12.840]  But I mean, look, it's up to you to get this out. The president's getting it. And others are getting it. We have to get a crash course in this now.
[57:12.840 --> 57:14.840]  I'm a nose.
[57:14.840 --> 57:18.840]  We're speeding as I'll say.
[57:18.840 --> 57:20.840]  We're speeding as I'll say.
[57:20.840 --> 57:28.840]  Can't remember now he says underlay, underlay, underlay, underlay, reba, reba, reba, reba, reba, reba, underlay, underlay, reba, reba, reba, reba, reba.
[57:28.840 --> 57:35.840]  I find to do that. But most of the Republicans are like, I am slow poking dollars. I do not know.

[1:00:08.840 --> 1:00:19.840]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[1:00:19.840 --> 1:00:22.840]  Ha ha ha!
[1:00:22.840 --> 1:00:27.840]  Ramming speed, baby! Ah! Good power!
[1:00:27.840 --> 1:00:36.840]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[1:00:36.840 --> 1:01:00.840]  I know that may not sound good to some of you. That sounds good to my ears, I'm sorry.
[1:01:00.840 --> 1:01:08.840]  Alright, let's get serious here. I don't really know how to put it or say it.
[1:01:08.840 --> 1:01:21.840]  But a lot of people think this is all a virtual reality deal, and now even top bankers and globalists, they say, oh, there's some outside force that's making everything a virtual reality and a simulation.
[1:01:21.840 --> 1:01:36.840]  The different telescopes and different systems they've got that measure dark matter. There's NASA papers, you name it, saying that indeed there's a power source much greater than what we see in our own matter.
[1:01:36.840 --> 1:01:45.840]  Holding this universe together, the whole Big Bang Theory and the rest of it, is just that theory.
[1:01:45.840 --> 1:01:56.840]  It's kind of like Total Recall. He goes in to plug in, he's having a boring life. It's a Philip K. Dick book, isn't it?
[1:01:56.840 --> 1:02:10.840]  And then all of a sudden he's a secret agent and he's killing all these guys and taking these people out and saving Mars and activating the ancient reactors to tarot-farm it.
[1:02:10.840 --> 1:02:15.840]  Is he crazy or is it real? You don't know.
[1:02:15.840 --> 1:02:23.840]  But to be sitting here and putting out the reports that I know go to the president, he goes to his lawyers that don't want to tell him all this because they're scared.
[1:02:23.840 --> 1:02:41.840]  So yes, sir, that's true. Sherman Antitrust Act section 2, Unfair Trade Practices, Racketeering, Election Violations, Federal Elections Commission, billions of dollars of funding is what the big tech is doing by blocking all conservatives and all people basically communicating with each other.
[1:02:41.840 --> 1:02:46.840]  It violates the First Amendment, violates civil rights. It's amazing.
[1:02:46.840 --> 1:02:57.840]  And then I just kind of sit back and go, is this even real? I'm on a planet orbiting a sun. I go out too long. It burns my skin. I can see meteors at night.
[1:02:57.840 --> 1:03:04.840]  There's all this incredible, beautiful stuff all around our world.
[1:03:04.840 --> 1:03:13.840]  My children, my wife, the audience, this operation, I mean, are you real?
[1:03:13.840 --> 1:03:29.840]  And you know what? We are the third dimension. And God says this is a third dimensional simulation, but done with RNA, with DNA, that it's a spiritual experience manifesting a real virtual reality that's so real, it's actually third dimension.
[1:03:29.840 --> 1:03:36.840]  The planet's real. Our bodies are real, but there is a spirit within us. And the globalists know that.
[1:03:36.840 --> 1:03:49.840]  And they know our spirit broadcasts the ideas and the thoughts and the dreams we have. So they put out evil broadcasts, trying to get us to resonate with that, to then buy into the nightmare, to then manifest hell on earth.
[1:03:49.840 --> 1:03:55.840]  Because that's what these demons, these creatures, these marooned spirits want.
[1:03:55.840 --> 1:04:02.840]  And that's what the Bible says. That's what every other culture says. And that's what the globalists believe. None of the globalists.
[1:04:02.840 --> 1:04:07.840]  They have run into a lot of them. Hollywood, you name it, none of them are atheists.
[1:04:07.840 --> 1:04:14.840]  They are either Luciferian or Satanist, or into the occult, or they believe in the earth being seeded by aliens.
[1:04:14.840 --> 1:04:29.840]  And those aliens are interdimensionally communicating with them, and they believe they have to reduce world population as a sacrifice to ascend to the heavens, a.k.a. what we've seen going on with 2001 Space Odyssey.
[1:04:29.840 --> 1:04:34.840]  So the Mark of the Beast is here, world government's here, and it's a simulation, but it's not.
[1:04:34.840 --> 1:04:39.840]  But it's been proven. It's all held together artificially by a much more powerful force.
[1:04:39.840 --> 1:04:51.840]  And it's here for us to experience consciousness and free will. Because if you're God, the one thing you don't have is something separate from you that's conscious as its own little universe in its mind.
[1:04:51.840 --> 1:05:00.840]  And that's us. That's our spirits, our own little universe.
[1:05:21.840 --> 1:05:39.840]  And now, because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever that everyone go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[1:05:39.840 --> 1:05:54.840]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the infowars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to, but the bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[1:05:54.840 --> 1:06:10.840]  We are the Renaissance, and we are winning.
[1:06:24.840 --> 1:06:42.840]  Every human soul is its own universe with unlimited potential.
[1:06:42.840 --> 1:06:59.840]  God creating independent sentient creatures with souls with spirits that are able to have the choice of free will built in the image of God as little creators, not big creators.
[1:06:59.840 --> 1:07:15.840]  That is the ultimate power of the Supreme Being, and would be the logical move would be to create something completely new that had its own free will, but in an embryonic level to then experience the universe for itself.
[1:07:15.840 --> 1:07:33.840]  Probably even in a way where the creator experienced the universe through the processes to rediscover that. But then you have to ask the question that my 10 year old daughter about two weeks ago at the dinner table looked at me and said, Dad, but if there was nothing there would be nothing.
[1:07:33.840 --> 1:07:37.840]  So what was there before God?
[1:07:37.840 --> 1:07:53.840]  Everyone I was a young child right through until I was a teenager and I stopped having the dream. Almost every night I had this dream amongst others. I have lots of dreams every night, hundreds and hundreds, the whole worlds, whole times, whole lifetimes, some of them, whole families, peoples.
[1:07:53.840 --> 1:07:57.840]  It just goes on and on. It's incredible.
[1:07:57.840 --> 1:08:01.840]  I mean, who says that world isn't more real than this world?
[1:08:01.840 --> 1:08:11.840]  Those are the crystal visions. I'll keep my visions in myself as one line from a rock song says.
[1:08:11.840 --> 1:08:19.840]  But think about that. God is all powerful. God is all encompassing timeless and endless.
[1:08:19.840 --> 1:08:45.840]  But then we are independent sentient creatures who are able to have free will or subvert our free will and hand it over to these other fallen failed creatures that decided not to go through the hierarchy, not to ascend to the long arduous process, but to do decided to just try to rule their fallen third and second dimension positions.
[1:08:45.840 --> 1:08:54.840]  And they want to kill, they want to destroy, they want to mutate, they want to hurt, they want to hurt innocents, they want to hurt children because that's the image of purity and potential.
[1:08:54.840 --> 1:08:59.840]  As Gandhi said, each person's soul is the seed of the universe.
[1:08:59.840 --> 1:09:24.840]  That's another way of saying we are all our own universe of potential of what we can do in this universe that is only a launchpad for the unlimited developments and unlimited discoveries and unlimited love that we can have together with other sentient, conscious, eternal, everlasting spirits.
[1:09:24.840 --> 1:09:30.840]  And that's the whole of everything. And the enemy is constantly trying to keep you as one of my producers said.
[1:09:30.840 --> 1:09:51.840]  He made a great point up in the cerebral distractions and fear based system of the day so that you're not aware of the greater universe and so that you can basically be locked in to the Madison Avenue and the TV and the Hollywood and the whole Times Square artificiality that they're trying to suck us in.
[1:09:51.840 --> 1:10:20.840]  Here's that famous Zuckerberg photo from a few years ago that Drudge always posts that has the Facebook employees all dutifully sitting, bent over, like subhumans with VR goggles on, virtual reality, hunched over their keyboards, looking at the virtual reality that Zuckerberg is projecting them into, making them submit to, making them excel in his own little ugly universe that he controls where he can play God and he walks in.
[1:10:20.840 --> 1:10:24.840]  And he walks bipedally.
[1:10:24.840 --> 1:10:28.840]  Through that crowd.
[1:10:28.840 --> 1:10:34.840]  Thank you search engine just Zuckerberg auditorium virtual reality and will come up.
[1:10:34.840 --> 1:10:38.840]  But but that photo tells a trillion words.
[1:10:38.840 --> 1:10:48.840]  It's all very funny to them. This is the great goal.
[1:10:48.840 --> 1:10:55.840]  And all the studies show and all the tech heads even admit they got to tell you metaphysically. This is hurting you. It's depressing you. It's dumbing you down.
[1:10:55.840 --> 1:10:59.840]  It's destroying your creativity. It's it's it's it's sapping you. It's draining you.
[1:10:59.840 --> 1:11:07.840]  But still you can't help it. But then we inject into the matrix here daily trying to reach you.
[1:11:07.840 --> 1:11:12.840]  And they were arrogant and tried to spin it. We said and did try to turn it around against us, but it didn't work.
[1:11:12.840 --> 1:11:15.840]  So finally they said ban him completely.
[1:11:15.840 --> 1:11:17.840]  Send him to the Phantom zone.
[1:11:17.840 --> 1:11:25.840]  And let it be a lesson to all the rest of them. You shut up about the topics Alex Jones covers or we will destroy you.
[1:11:25.840 --> 1:11:30.840]  We will tell elaborate lies and frauds about you every day. We will come after your family.
[1:11:30.840 --> 1:11:35.840]  We will bankrupt you. We will destroy you if you don't submit to us.
[1:11:35.840 --> 1:11:38.840]  Well, that's slavery and that doesn't intimidate me.
[1:11:38.840 --> 1:11:41.840]  But the average empty person.
[1:11:41.840 --> 1:11:46.840]  So scared of death. So scared trying to hold on to everything.
[1:11:46.840 --> 1:11:50.840]  Be scared because in their spirit, they know they've made the wrong decisions.
[1:11:50.840 --> 1:11:56.840]  But then the system has control of their cerebral cortex and only one small part of their consciousness.
[1:11:56.840 --> 1:11:59.840]  And it's saying you fill that fear. You feel that you're not fulfilled.
[1:11:59.840 --> 1:12:08.840]  Follow us deeper down the pit down the black hole. We will give you fulfillment, but you've got to take our hand.
[1:12:08.840 --> 1:12:13.840]  And they get scarier and scarier and scarier and they say you're scared of Trump.
[1:12:13.840 --> 1:12:17.840]  You're scared of Alex Jones. Come deeper with us.
[1:12:17.840 --> 1:12:21.840]  And they're like, I'm even more scared. I know, I know, but trust us.
[1:12:21.840 --> 1:12:28.840]  Just keep holding on to my hand until everything you are.
[1:12:28.840 --> 1:12:32.840]  And everything you've ever been is under my control.
[1:12:32.840 --> 1:12:37.840]  Give me your consciousness. Give me your creativity.
[1:12:37.840 --> 1:12:43.840]  Give me your dreams and your heart and your soul and your fears and everything you are.
[1:12:43.840 --> 1:12:47.840]  And believe as I believe and say as I say and repeat what I am.
[1:12:47.840 --> 1:12:53.840]  Replicate me. Join with my consciousness and subvert yourself to me.
[1:12:53.840 --> 1:12:58.840]  And I will give you the stars. I will give you fulfillment.
[1:12:58.840 --> 1:13:02.840]  I know you follow me long and things only get worse.
[1:13:02.840 --> 1:13:05.840]  But that is for only so long.
[1:13:05.840 --> 1:13:13.840]  Once, once you're in the deeper water, it will be blessed at the heart of a dead star forever.
[1:13:13.840 --> 1:13:20.840]  The cold is so great for eternity. Destroyed.
[1:13:20.840 --> 1:13:27.840]  That is their only power is destroying the will and the consciousness that you are
[1:13:27.840 --> 1:13:33.840]  and keeping you from exercising your free will and going through the fear and going through the challenges.
[1:13:33.840 --> 1:13:39.840]  And as soon as you do that, you're so fulfilled, you're like, oh my God, how did I not see this earlier?
[1:13:39.840 --> 1:13:42.840]  And then you aren't depressed because you're not part of the system.
[1:13:42.840 --> 1:13:48.840]  You're depressed because you know you're losing your family and you're losing people you cared about.
[1:13:48.840 --> 1:13:54.840]  And when they look at you and manifest that hatred and that evil, it hurts your feelings
[1:13:54.840 --> 1:13:58.840]  because you care about them and they smile back at you and you watch them through progression.
[1:13:58.840 --> 1:14:04.840]  Go from being depressed, sad people to running that demonic, smiling, jack-o-lantern face,
[1:14:04.840 --> 1:14:11.840]  joker face of just I'm in charge and it feels good and I'm doing what I want
[1:14:11.840 --> 1:14:20.840]  and I'm in make-believe land and woo, yeah, they're gone.
[1:14:20.840 --> 1:14:32.840]  Their soul was consumed, rewritten, diseased, destroyed forever, blown out the airlock.
[1:14:32.840 --> 1:14:38.840]  They thought they were rising, they were falling.
[1:14:38.840 --> 1:14:46.840]  And the average person going into this lower dimensional overwrite thinks that it's an exhilarating feeling as they're falling,
[1:14:46.840 --> 1:14:53.840]  falling away from God, falling into a black hole and they're like, whoa, this is quite a feeling as they fall.
[1:14:53.840 --> 1:15:07.840]  And as they get closer and closer to their oblivion, there's a satanic euphoria that overtakes them and then they are disintegrated.
[1:15:07.840 --> 1:15:19.840]  And many of them are walking around who are completely gone, husk through which evil light shines through,
[1:15:19.840 --> 1:15:22.840]  unconscious of how twisted and evil they are.
[1:15:22.840 --> 1:15:26.840]  I saw a Democrat today on TV while I was working out and he didn't say his name and I said,
[1:15:26.840 --> 1:15:30.840]  that guy looks like the biggest psychopathic evil person I've ever seen.
[1:15:30.840 --> 1:15:35.840]  And Pat Riley was working me out and he goes, yeah, I bet it's a Democrat.
[1:15:35.840 --> 1:15:38.840]  And then we pulled it up, it was the California attorney general.
[1:15:38.840 --> 1:15:44.840]  I go, oh my God, I mean, he just flames evil and fraud and totally being turned over.
[1:15:44.840 --> 1:15:48.840]  I mean, it's an avatar, it's off world crap, it's in that guy.
[1:15:48.840 --> 1:15:53.840]  And you know it and then you look up his record, he wants everything free for illegal aliens to bankrupt the country.
[1:15:53.840 --> 1:15:56.840]  He's an actual agent against humanity.
[1:15:56.840 --> 1:16:02.840]  When you use public Wi-Fi, hackers and identity thieves can see anything you do online.

[1:18:30.840 --> 1:18:35.840]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients.
[1:18:35.840 --> 1:18:40.840]  But our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[1:18:40.840 --> 1:18:49.840]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.

[1:19:19.840 --> 1:19:24.840]  Now we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH.
[1:19:24.840 --> 1:19:30.840]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[1:19:30.840 --> 1:19:41.840]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[1:19:41.840 --> 1:19:52.840]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water. So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[1:19:52.840 --> 1:19:57.840]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[1:19:57.840 --> 1:20:03.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:20:28.840 --> 1:20:36.840]  You have about 800 million followers. That's why you're banned.
[1:20:36.840 --> 1:20:48.840]  Virtually every day the big tech companies censor someone else whose political opinions they disagree with.
[1:20:48.840 --> 1:20:56.840]  For many on the left, the views seem to have become that if you can't beat them, prevent them from speaking.
[1:20:56.840 --> 1:21:03.840]  Now they're down to the last corners of the Internet. Oh no, conservatives can speak to one another. We must shut it up.
[1:21:03.840 --> 1:21:08.840]  People know what's true. They can smell it. You can't stop them from knowing that.
[1:21:12.840 --> 1:21:17.840]  69 days, ladies and gentlemen, from the most important election in world history.
[1:21:17.840 --> 1:21:22.840]  A referendum on the return of America, the return of the Republic.
[1:21:22.840 --> 1:21:31.840]  All the enemies far in a domestic are lined up giving their full energy, their full hate, their full will, and their quest to control your hearts and minds.
[1:21:31.840 --> 1:21:42.840]  I'm honored to be here. But I gotta tell you, I'm beyond on the edge of my seat. I am in the arena fighting as hard as I can.
[1:21:42.840 --> 1:21:48.840]  Stumbling but having victory. Thanks for your support. We're all in this together.
[1:21:48.840 --> 1:21:55.840]  I've told you that I intend to open the phones up more and I tend to go to your calls quicker and get to more of them.
[1:21:55.840 --> 1:22:02.840]  The problem is we can take up to 100 phone calls at once. So we'll get like 20 of you on the line and I'll end up getting to 10 of you.
[1:22:02.840 --> 1:22:13.840]  But I'm going to try to go to as many people as I can on this one subject and I want to give folks a chance to call in as first time callers.
[1:22:13.840 --> 1:22:22.840]  So first time callers on the subject of what does Trump need to do to stop the Internet censorship?
[1:22:22.840 --> 1:22:26.840]  What would you like to see him do? What do you expect him to do?
[1:22:26.840 --> 1:22:34.840]  And what are you going to do to make sure that buzz gets going to Congress to talk radio at city council meetings, PTA meetings?
[1:22:34.840 --> 1:22:44.840]  I don't care where you can have a forum. Lions club, your Masonic club, your Catholic church, your Buddhist temple, whatever the case is.
[1:22:44.840 --> 1:22:53.840]  If you don't want to be under radical Islam, if you don't want to be under globalism, if you like prosperity and you want America and you like the success
[1:22:53.840 --> 1:23:00.840]  and you like Trump and you like yourself, you need to get involved. So what are you going to do? I want to hear what Trump needs to do, what I need to do, what you need to do.
[1:23:00.840 --> 1:23:08.840]  I want to hear your ideas. Every little bit counts. You know, I saw an article in some publication this morning. It was about Reddit.
[1:23:08.840 --> 1:23:16.840]  And it was talking about, maybe it was Slate or something, look it up, but it was, this is one place Alex Jones won't be banned.
[1:23:16.840 --> 1:23:21.840]  And it showed a subreddit about cars with InfoWars bumper stickers on them.
[1:23:21.840 --> 1:23:25.840]  And the left is just saying, gosh, we can't stop people doing this on the street.
[1:23:25.840 --> 1:23:30.840]  Absolutely. Nobody can stop you from printing off a poster that says infowars.com, forbidden information.
[1:23:30.840 --> 1:23:36.840]  In fact, I'll tweet that out next segment. We'll find those posters and tweet them out at real Alex Jones.
[1:23:36.840 --> 1:23:40.840]  No one can stop you from being your own printer or going to Kinko's, printing them up color,
[1:23:40.840 --> 1:23:44.840]  printing up a thousand of those going out at night, sticking them on poles everywhere where everybody else puts stuff up.
[1:23:44.840 --> 1:23:52.840]  And there'll be a big event the next day. The news is like, Alex Jones is all over town. It's fun to do that.
[1:23:52.840 --> 1:23:56.840]  I'm willing to sacrifice my life for this. Let's have some fun with it.
[1:23:56.840 --> 1:24:03.840]  And InfoWars is now the standard of free speech. It's now the example. It's now the world leader in it.
[1:24:03.840 --> 1:24:07.840]  That's because of you. It isn't about credit, but I want you to get it in your head.
[1:24:07.840 --> 1:24:11.840]  It's not Alex Jones. It's not even this great crew. We're part of it with you.
[1:24:11.840 --> 1:24:15.840]  You, the millions of listeners, is who they fear. That's why they want us shut down,
[1:24:15.840 --> 1:24:20.840]  because it's a place for you to talk and get more information and to come together.
[1:24:20.840 --> 1:24:25.840]  It's a place where you're validated. It's a place where you get aid and sucker.
[1:24:25.840 --> 1:24:30.840]  It's a place where you get people that aid and abet you.
[1:24:30.840 --> 1:24:34.840]  It's a place where you have family. It's a place where you know you're not alone.
[1:24:34.840 --> 1:24:39.840]  When you're pressured and attacked and demonized and persecuted, it makes me feel so good knowing you're out there
[1:24:39.840 --> 1:24:43.840]  when they lie about me and do terrible things on a daily basis, because I know we're in this together
[1:24:43.840 --> 1:24:45.840]  and I love you and I appreciate you.
[1:24:45.840 --> 1:24:50.840]  So, the toll-free number to join us, which is 69 days out.
[1:24:50.840 --> 1:24:54.840]  And as long as you get to my topic of what should Trump do, how should we counter it,
[1:24:54.840 --> 1:24:56.840]  what are you going to do, what should I do, you can get into it.
[1:24:56.840 --> 1:25:00.840]  False flags clearly are coming to blame us. They've got that all pre-programmed,
[1:25:00.840 --> 1:25:03.840]  saying we're about to attack them and we're not lying about us.
[1:25:03.840 --> 1:25:06.840]  How do we counter that? Let's get to that first big topic.
[1:25:06.840 --> 1:25:09.840]  Then you can throw something else out, but I want to give each person a minute.
[1:25:09.840 --> 1:25:12.840]  I want to comment for 30 seconds and move to the next person.
[1:25:12.840 --> 1:25:17.840]  And I used to be good at taking calls and I've got a little bit better, but everybody knows that I'm long-winded.
[1:25:17.840 --> 1:25:22.840]  877-789-2539, 877-789-2539.
[1:25:22.840 --> 1:25:28.840]  Now, that number, 877-789-2539, I apologize.
[1:25:28.840 --> 1:25:31.840]  When you get on the line, we'll probably never get to everybody because of the phone system.
[1:25:31.840 --> 1:25:38.840]  One time in a two-hour show, it was a Sunday show, we had 20, was it three or 4,000 calls?
[1:25:38.840 --> 1:25:40.840]  We have a digital system, we can see it.
[1:25:40.840 --> 1:25:44.840]  Now, a lot of folks were calling back, but I mean, nobody gets calls like this.
[1:25:44.840 --> 1:25:48.840]  But the problem is, is that I can never get to them and the folks that will be on hold kind of fall asleep.
[1:25:48.840 --> 1:25:50.840]  And then that's what we want to move through your calls quickly.
[1:25:50.840 --> 1:25:54.840]  I think I'm going to start doing something where I maybe take six, seven calls, get them on the board,
[1:25:54.840 --> 1:25:57.840]  close the phone system again so you can't call, take those, reopen it.
[1:25:57.840 --> 1:26:02.840]  That way it's all fresh and nobody ever holds more than 30 minutes.
[1:26:02.840 --> 1:26:03.840]  That's what I like to do.
[1:26:03.840 --> 1:26:06.840]  Now, I've been talking about it. I haven't gotten into the report yet.
[1:26:06.840 --> 1:26:09.840]  I will briefly do it when we come back and then I'll go to your calls.
[1:26:09.840 --> 1:26:12.840]  The social media purge of conservatives is a giant election meddling scheme.
[1:26:12.840 --> 1:26:15.840]  Why am I harping on this?
[1:26:15.840 --> 1:26:18.840]  Because we've got the president's here.
[1:26:18.840 --> 1:26:19.840]  Congress is moving.
[1:26:19.840 --> 1:26:22.840]  I have Kudlow coming up next segment saying they're looking at all the options.
[1:26:22.840 --> 1:26:28.840]  I know little folks, little birds that had dinner with Kudlow in New York five days ago.
[1:26:28.840 --> 1:26:29.840]  And I'll just stop there.
[1:26:29.840 --> 1:26:32.840]  So let me just tell you, I'm not about access.
[1:26:32.840 --> 1:26:33.840]  I'm not about Hollywood.
[1:26:33.840 --> 1:26:34.840]  I'm not about being in D.C.
[1:26:34.840 --> 1:26:35.840]  I'm not about being close to the power.
[1:26:35.840 --> 1:26:38.840]  I want to build my own thing, okay?
[1:26:38.840 --> 1:26:43.840]  But they try to block me on the Internet and I'm like, you didn't know?
[1:26:43.840 --> 1:26:46.840]  I can just get on the telephone or I can make a few calls.
[1:26:46.840 --> 1:26:50.840]  Any member of Congress that's a Republican I want who isn't a globalist?
[1:26:50.840 --> 1:26:55.840]  I mean, if I have to call people and send them stuff by courier, I will.
[1:26:55.840 --> 1:26:56.840]  And guess what?
[1:26:56.840 --> 1:26:59.840]  When I do it personally, it's much better than me just on there talking about it.
[1:26:59.840 --> 1:27:04.840]  So now more and more, I'm going home at night after the kids go to bed.
[1:27:04.840 --> 1:27:08.840]  But like eight, nine o'clock or I'm letting them watch a movie and I go into my office
[1:27:08.840 --> 1:27:10.840]  and I got 10 people every night.
[1:27:10.840 --> 1:27:18.840]  I call different people and I call them and I have a talk with them.
[1:27:18.840 --> 1:27:20.840]  And I say, you got 600 radio stations.
[1:27:20.840 --> 1:27:23.840]  I really need you to do this for yourself and your family.
[1:27:23.840 --> 1:27:24.840]  You got 500 radio stations.
[1:27:24.840 --> 1:27:26.840]  You got 300 radio stations.
[1:27:26.840 --> 1:27:27.840]  You're a congressman.
[1:27:27.840 --> 1:27:28.840]  Do what you need to do.
[1:27:28.840 --> 1:27:29.840]  Why can't you see this?
[1:27:29.840 --> 1:27:30.840]  Well, they're big tech.
[1:27:30.840 --> 1:27:32.840]  They got a lot of money and I'm not sure, you know, really.
[1:27:32.840 --> 1:27:34.840]  You got the one that's got to do it.
[1:27:34.840 --> 1:27:36.840]  Do it.
[1:27:36.840 --> 1:27:39.840]  The games are over.
[1:27:39.840 --> 1:27:42.840]  And if I got to step into the leadership role here when nobody else will,
[1:27:42.840 --> 1:27:47.840]  I've just been trying to like warn people like Paul Revere and then no one wants to become George Washington.
[1:27:47.840 --> 1:27:50.840]  Well, if I got to be George Washington, I will.
[1:27:50.840 --> 1:27:52.840]  But we got to George Washington.
[1:27:52.840 --> 1:27:55.840]  He's called Donald John Trump.
[1:27:55.840 --> 1:27:59.840]  So I need Paul Revere's to get the message out and I love you and I appreciate you.
[1:27:59.840 --> 1:28:04.840]  That said, our problems are basically solved if you flood us with money.
[1:28:04.840 --> 1:28:09.840]  And we've got just enough coming in to barely expand with the lawsuits and the crap and we're winning,
[1:28:09.840 --> 1:28:10.840]  but we need fuel in the war.
[1:28:10.840 --> 1:28:12.840]  We need ammo.
[1:28:12.840 --> 1:28:13.840]  So commit.

[1:32:07.080 --> 1:32:08.580]  to detoxify the body.
[1:32:08.580 --> 1:32:13.440]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[1:32:13.440 --> 1:32:14.960]  It's made in the USA.
[1:32:14.960 --> 1:32:19.880]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[1:32:19.880 --> 1:32:21.720]  the body and it supports the infor.
[1:32:21.720 --> 1:32:23.960]  It is a classical 360 win.
[1:32:23.960 --> 1:32:28.440]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe
[1:32:28.440 --> 1:32:33.320]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[1:32:33.320 --> 1:32:34.320]  get.

[1:32:42.360 --> 1:32:47.600]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[1:32:47.600 --> 1:32:51.480]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be thanks to your support and your
[1:32:51.480 --> 1:32:52.480]  prayers together.
[1:32:52.480 --> 1:32:53.480]  We're changing the world.
[1:32:53.480 --> 1:33:21.480]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield InfoWarsLive.com.
[1:33:23.480 --> 1:33:31.840]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:31.840 --> 1:33:37.560]  Yeah, I think Google is really taking advantage of a lot of people and I think that's a very
[1:33:37.560 --> 1:33:40.440]  serious thing and it's a very serious charge.
[1:33:40.440 --> 1:33:45.000]  I think what Google and what others are doing, if you look at what's going on at Twitter,
[1:33:45.000 --> 1:33:50.040]  if you look at what's going on in Facebook, they better be careful because you can't
[1:33:50.040 --> 1:33:51.040]  do that to people.
[1:33:51.040 --> 1:33:52.040]  You can't do it.
[1:33:52.040 --> 1:33:57.760]  The tremendous, we have literally thousands and thousands of complaints coming in and
[1:33:57.760 --> 1:33:58.960]  you just can't do that.
[1:33:58.960 --> 1:34:04.960]  So I think that Google and Twitter and Facebook, they're really treading on very, very troubled
[1:34:04.960 --> 1:34:07.000]  territory and they have to be careful.
[1:34:07.000 --> 1:34:10.440]  It's not fair to large portions of the population.
[1:34:10.440 --> 1:34:11.440]  Okay?
[1:34:11.440 --> 1:34:14.760]  Thank you very much, everybody.
[1:34:14.760 --> 1:34:16.440]  It is discriminatory.
[1:34:16.440 --> 1:34:20.320]  It violates the Sherman anti-trust act and I'm at Bloomberg Articles, CNBC.
[1:34:20.320 --> 1:34:24.680]  They're all, I'm going to go to these in a moment that your phone calls, admitting that
[1:34:24.680 --> 1:34:28.080]  the tech giants have been illegally spying on people, they've been discriminating on
[1:34:28.080 --> 1:34:32.560]  your income, your race, your religion, they have it all and then they admit in their own
[1:34:32.560 --> 1:34:38.360]  sales perspectives that they're specifically charging you what they think you'll pay for.
[1:34:38.360 --> 1:34:40.080]  I mean, a cheeseburger ought to be a cheeseburger.
[1:34:40.080 --> 1:34:44.640]  You walk into a water burger and you're a white guy and a double cheeseburger should
[1:34:44.640 --> 1:34:47.640]  be $5 and if you're a black guy, it should be $5.
[1:34:47.640 --> 1:34:49.520]  If you're a woman, it should be $5.
[1:34:49.520 --> 1:34:50.520]  Let's see.
[1:34:50.520 --> 1:34:51.520]  That's not how it works.
[1:34:51.520 --> 1:34:52.520]  The Amazon and others have been caught.
[1:34:52.520 --> 1:34:59.440]  Well, some of the big travel companies, remember, and I noticed this years ago, like if I bought
[1:34:59.440 --> 1:35:02.280]  first class on something, the next time I went back to that, it was like way more and
[1:35:02.280 --> 1:35:06.800]  I learned to clear cookies and then it'd be like half the price.
[1:35:06.800 --> 1:35:09.480]  I'm like $15,000 first class to England.
[1:35:09.480 --> 1:35:13.920]  I paid like $3,000 about six months ago and then it's like clear the cookies.
[1:35:13.920 --> 1:35:14.920]  It's $4,000.
[1:35:14.920 --> 1:35:18.640]  I'm like, well, I guess I'll pay for that because my back's hurting or whatever.
[1:35:18.640 --> 1:35:25.760]  The point is, is that, and then sure enough, it was in the news they're gaming it.
[1:35:25.760 --> 1:35:29.640]  So these big tech companies are screwing people over seven ways from Sunday and if they can
[1:35:29.640 --> 1:35:33.000]  get the left to all support censorship and what they're doing in the name of fighting
[1:35:33.000 --> 1:35:36.440]  Republicans, they love it because they can really then just screw everyone over.
[1:35:36.440 --> 1:35:42.280]  We ought to all come together under free speech and under equal opportunity, which is what
[1:35:42.280 --> 1:35:46.240]  the Republicans all got passed through Congress and the Democrats then run around and take
[1:35:46.240 --> 1:35:47.240]  advantage of it.
[1:35:47.240 --> 1:35:51.120]  You know, my grandfather, my grandmother, they supported desegregation.
[1:35:51.120 --> 1:35:52.120]  She was a school teacher.
[1:35:52.120 --> 1:35:53.520]  He was a county tax assessor.
[1:35:53.520 --> 1:35:55.240]  They were Republicans in East Texas.
[1:35:55.240 --> 1:35:59.240]  That's like the South and they had people threaten them and get mad at them and it was
[1:35:59.240 --> 1:36:00.560]  like, they were trying to build people up.
[1:36:00.560 --> 1:36:04.680]  They were trying to believe in what Martin Luther King talked about how today we're told
[1:36:04.680 --> 1:36:10.320]  Republicans are Nazis because people don't have a memory of five years ago or a month
[1:36:10.320 --> 1:36:11.320]  ago.
[1:36:11.320 --> 1:36:16.400]  I mean, CNN, I went to CNN yesterday and they got articles where all the top Google searches
[1:36:16.400 --> 1:36:18.400]  were CNN saying Trump's crazy.
[1:36:18.400 --> 1:36:19.400]  There's no tech censorship.
[1:36:19.400 --> 1:36:21.240]  Google doesn't censorship.
[1:36:21.240 --> 1:36:25.280]  They were CNN was calling for all of us to be banned, getting us banned.
[1:36:25.280 --> 1:36:27.040]  And then days later saying, we're crazy.
[1:36:27.040 --> 1:36:28.640]  No one's banning us CNN.
[1:36:28.640 --> 1:36:30.000]  I have a memory.
[1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:35.160]  But more importantly, I then showed in a special broadcast at a year, said info wars.com and
[1:36:35.160 --> 1:36:37.440]  real Alex Jones on Twitter.
[1:36:37.440 --> 1:36:41.080]  All these CNN articles, like 20 of them saying censor them, take them out the air.
[1:36:41.080 --> 1:36:42.560]  Don't stop with Alex Jones.
[1:36:42.560 --> 1:36:46.840]  And then the very same reporter that said, take me off said Trump's crazy.
[1:36:46.840 --> 1:36:50.080]  It's not happening.
[1:36:50.080 --> 1:36:52.080]  That is beyond dastardly.
[1:36:52.080 --> 1:36:57.240]  That's, I think it's stupid, but see, they're trying to break your will.
[1:36:57.240 --> 1:37:02.000]  They're trying to train you to accept anything and everything.
[1:37:02.000 --> 1:37:03.160]  So now the headlines are everywhere.
[1:37:03.160 --> 1:37:08.680]  Wall Street Journal, New York Times, even the Washington Times is Trump right about
[1:37:08.680 --> 1:37:17.440]  conservatives being censored and discriminated against, okay, is Bill Clinton a rapist?
[1:37:17.440 --> 1:37:23.840]  Is the Pacific Ocean West of California?
[1:37:23.840 --> 1:37:28.640]  I mean, this is getting downright ridiculous.
[1:37:28.640 --> 1:37:33.680]  They're censoring and shadow banning and total banning across the board.
[1:37:33.680 --> 1:37:35.320]  They've been lobbying for it.
[1:37:35.320 --> 1:37:39.440]  They have all these Democrat House and Senate members saying Jones is on the tip of the
[1:37:39.440 --> 1:37:41.960]  iceberg, ban them all.
[1:37:41.960 --> 1:37:44.200]  I want thousands of sites banned.
[1:37:44.200 --> 1:37:51.600]  Senator Whiten, Senator Murphy, Senator Warner, who run the thing.
[1:37:51.600 --> 1:37:56.440]  And then these arrogant people at Google won't even send their CEO to Congress when
[1:37:56.440 --> 1:37:59.560]  he's subpoenaed.
[1:37:59.560 --> 1:38:01.400]  So they think you're a bunch of idiots in Congress.
[1:38:01.400 --> 1:38:04.640]  They think Martin Lutherans are idiots and they think we're all, no, we're not idiots.
[1:38:04.640 --> 1:38:08.320]  We're not idiots, Zuckerberg.
[1:38:08.320 --> 1:38:10.720]  And we're sick of it.
[1:38:10.720 --> 1:38:13.520]  And I'm tired of you lying about what I said and what I did.
[1:38:13.520 --> 1:38:16.400]  Their favorite thing is I'm transphobic.
[1:38:16.400 --> 1:38:17.400]  I'm a libertarian.
[1:38:17.400 --> 1:38:20.960]  I'm not against anybody as long as they're not hurting kids.
[1:38:20.960 --> 1:38:22.920]  What you want to do in your own life, you do.
[1:38:22.920 --> 1:38:25.000]  Everyone knows that's what I've always said it's who I am.
[1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:27.400]  They have headlines all over the place.
[1:38:27.400 --> 1:38:29.840]  Jones hates the LGBT Jones.
[1:38:29.840 --> 1:38:30.840]  And you know what I've noticed?
[1:38:30.840 --> 1:38:34.240]  I'm going to do a special report on this and maybe even a documentary.
[1:38:34.240 --> 1:38:38.640]  Which when I criticized pedophilia and the Catholic Church and sexualization of kids
[1:38:38.640 --> 1:38:44.440]  by any group, heterosexual, homosexual, I get called homophobic by these publications.
[1:38:44.440 --> 1:38:54.560]  And so what they're really saying is the core of the LGBT is run by the P.
[1:38:54.560 --> 1:39:06.200]  LGBT, lesbian, gay, bi, trans, and then you had to pee at the end.
[1:39:06.200 --> 1:39:10.520]  Because what happens is, just like they said, I said kill members of the media, never said
[1:39:10.520 --> 1:39:12.080]  it, fake headlines.
[1:39:12.080 --> 1:39:17.800]  Or anything I do, they turn around, it's when I criticize sexualization of children and
[1:39:17.800 --> 1:39:22.840]  I say, I don't care if it's in the quote, you know, education, whatever, having drag
[1:39:22.840 --> 1:39:28.040]  queens or trans or straight, imagine if straight guys came, so we're going to teach her three
[1:39:28.040 --> 1:39:32.760]  year olds their sex might be different and talk to them about sex, you'd go no way pervert.
[1:39:32.760 --> 1:39:38.440]  Like some dude, hi at the park, I like to talk to your five year old daughter about her sexuality.
[1:39:38.440 --> 1:39:43.200]  Maybe she really thinks she identifies a 20 year old woman would like to date me.
[1:39:43.200 --> 1:39:44.960]  You'd call the police.
[1:39:44.960 --> 1:39:55.280]  But if you say, oh, it's diversity training, then you're not, oh, well, absolutely.
[1:39:55.280 --> 1:40:01.240]  If you want to have, you know, a group of men and women's clothing come in and tell kids,
[1:40:01.240 --> 1:40:05.360]  you are a girl, but you could be a boy, you're a boy, you could be a girl, I mean, how crazy
[1:40:05.360 --> 1:40:06.360]  is this?
[1:40:06.360 --> 1:40:11.840]  And then they go, Jones was being transphobic again.
[1:40:11.840 --> 1:40:17.040]  And so, I mean, that's really, and people are, people are figuring this out.
[1:40:17.040 --> 1:40:20.960]  Now there's PubMed studies, pedophilia and the gay movement.
[1:40:20.960 --> 1:40:27.720]  I mean, if gay people, I won't use homosexuals, heterosexuals, sign of a term, but I'll use
[1:40:27.720 --> 1:40:28.720]  the term you want.
[1:40:28.720 --> 1:40:31.760]  It used to mean just a happy day.
[1:40:31.760 --> 1:40:36.480]  If you aren't for pedophilia, then stop lying when I stand up for children and abuse people
[1:40:36.480 --> 1:40:39.520]  and saying I'm attacking you and I don't even think about what you're doing in your bedroom.
[1:40:39.520 --> 1:40:44.200]  I got my own life, like, oh my God, people are doing something, and then you project
[1:40:44.200 --> 1:40:47.000]  onto me all of this, it's pure crud.
[1:40:47.000 --> 1:40:50.280]  We'll go to break and come back, but, and I promise to go to your calls right through
[1:40:50.280 --> 1:40:57.680]  the next hour, we're gonna go to Willie and Barrett and Kevin and Caleb and Matt and Brian

[1:41:02.360 --> 1:41:06.000]  But the good news is the president's moving against these folks, real things are happening
[1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:10.200]  and it's because of you getting the word out and I want to salute all of you and it's not
[1:41:10.200 --> 1:41:12.880]  about thanking people, but you need to know you've done a good job.
[1:41:12.880 --> 1:41:14.480]  You spread the word, keep doing it.

[1:43:58.080 --> 1:44:03.560]  The whole thing was for me leg, first demonize infowars, lie about us, build a straw man,
[1:44:03.560 --> 1:44:09.000]  then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook
[1:44:09.000 --> 1:44:13.200]  with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia.
[1:44:13.200 --> 1:44:14.200]  And then wallah.
[1:44:14.200 --> 1:44:20.320]  Two weeks later ban infowars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were

[1:46:42.120 --> 1:46:43.320]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[1:46:43.320 --> 1:46:49.040]  So thank you all for remembering infowarsstore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's
[1:46:49.040 --> 1:46:52.480]  already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake and it's so essential to spread
[1:46:52.480 --> 1:46:53.480]  the word.
[1:46:53.480 --> 1:47:00.960]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[1:47:00.960 --> 1:47:12.480]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:12.480 --> 1:47:18.880]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[1:47:18.880 --> 1:47:19.880]  the info war.
[1:47:19.880 --> 1:47:27.560]  So the globalists want to sabotage the 2018 elections and try to put populism back on
[1:47:27.560 --> 1:47:28.560]  its heels.
[1:47:28.560 --> 1:47:34.000]  Nice try, populism is exploding worldwide, the global is being thrown out across Europe,
[1:47:34.000 --> 1:47:35.760]  Latin America, you name it.
[1:47:35.760 --> 1:47:41.880]  If they're striking back hard, we need to decide some victory now to really demoralize
[1:47:41.880 --> 1:47:43.640]  the enemy.
[1:47:43.640 --> 1:47:48.120]  Key article on infowars.com, I'm begging everybody to get out to everyone they know.
[1:47:48.120 --> 1:47:53.240]  See what we talk about, have we pushed it over the top?
[1:47:53.240 --> 1:47:57.120]  Whoever's going to link to this, it's critical you get it out there because the social media
[1:47:57.120 --> 1:48:00.560]  purge of conservatives is a giant election meddling scheme.
[1:48:00.560 --> 1:48:07.560]  Paul Joseph Watson, when it goes through the examples, the admissions, the banning, how
[1:48:07.560 --> 1:48:14.920]  they're doing it, how to stop them, what the president needs to do.
[1:48:14.920 --> 1:48:20.200]  And you notice now, we've got petitions at whitehouse.gov.
[1:48:20.200 --> 1:48:23.720]  Bring attention to this, the tens of thousands just signed since yesterday, since Paul Watson
[1:48:23.720 --> 1:48:25.160]  put up, it's critical.
[1:48:25.160 --> 1:48:28.560]  I've retweeted it at real Alex Jones, please get that out.
[1:48:28.560 --> 1:48:33.400]  Meanwhile, Trump, Facebook, Twitter, Google are treading on very, very troubled territory,
[1:48:33.400 --> 1:48:39.320]  thin ice, and they had to be careful how Trump could hurt Google, Politico, unfair trade
[1:48:39.320 --> 1:48:50.240]  practices, Sherman Antitrust Act, Section 2, lying to Congress, collusion, market rigging,
[1:48:50.240 --> 1:48:53.480]  everything I told you.
[1:48:53.480 --> 1:48:58.640]  Everything I told you, the Federal Trade Commission, antitrust, word for word, what
[1:48:58.640 --> 1:48:59.960]  I told you.
[1:48:59.960 --> 1:49:00.960]  Next week's news today.
[1:49:00.960 --> 1:49:04.880]  I'm bragging, I'm just saying, you think I just play around and act like I know what
[1:49:04.880 --> 1:49:05.880]  I'm talking about?
[1:49:05.880 --> 1:49:12.960]  I already knew all this, but I checked with three different law firms and other groups.
[1:49:12.960 --> 1:49:15.360]  Mike Adams is the host of the Fourth Hour, he wrote a report to the president as well,
[1:49:15.360 --> 1:49:17.560]  we got to him.
[1:49:17.560 --> 1:49:24.240]  Those probes, Google after Trump accuses it of bias, Yahoo News, Reuters accuses it.
[1:49:24.240 --> 1:49:28.080]  It's a joke how biased it is, go look at the search results, they got caught in WikiLeaks
[1:49:28.080 --> 1:49:29.080]  doing it.
[1:49:29.080 --> 1:49:34.120]  Now it's 100 times worse, literally, a thousand times, it's everything censored.
[1:49:34.120 --> 1:49:39.480]  Rights group urged no censor Google search for China, major rights group, AP reports,
[1:49:39.480 --> 1:49:45.400]  oh, remember this is getting no attention, until we covered it, until Drudge covered
[1:49:45.400 --> 1:49:49.400]  it, the intercept, oh, they're spilling a censorship engine, Congress threatened them
[1:49:49.400 --> 1:49:55.080]  with espionage in 2010, they didn't stop helping censor the Chinese people and enslave them,
[1:49:55.080 --> 1:50:00.640]  and now it's back in the news, oh, Google, banning me didn't stop that from coming out,
[1:50:00.640 --> 1:50:01.640]  did it.
[1:50:01.640 --> 1:50:04.040]  We'll get more into that.
[1:50:04.040 --> 1:50:08.200]  We should all be worried about Google's power, New York Post.
[1:50:08.200 --> 1:50:13.320]  Senators criticize Google's CEO for declining to testify, subpoena has asked, dozens at
[1:50:13.320 --> 1:50:18.200]  Facebook unite to challenge its intolerant liberal culture, study, it's a bunch of liberal
[1:50:18.200 --> 1:50:23.280]  bullies, study affirms Google's search results, lean left, golden daily, Facebook engineers
[1:50:23.280 --> 1:50:28.920]  stunning admission, we tear down posters welcoming Trump supporters, Trump Google news story,
[1:50:28.920 --> 1:50:34.760]  CNN claiming Google isn't rigged, is the top feed, censor now online media companies are
[1:50:34.760 --> 1:50:41.560]  suppressing conservative speech, Trump is doing everything he said he do, thank God for Trump.
[1:50:41.560 --> 1:50:45.240]  Okay, now starting now and right through the next hour, your calls, interspersed a lot
[1:50:45.240 --> 1:50:51.280]  of the breaking news, MSNBC, CNN defend Antifa, claim Trump rationalizes and urges violence
[1:50:51.280 --> 1:50:55.640]  when they're the violent ones, and they also say Antifa is black, so saying they're bad
[1:50:55.640 --> 1:51:01.720]  is racist, though they're almost all meth head, white young people or professors.
[1:51:01.720 --> 1:51:07.160]  Our crowds protesting them are way more diverse than theirs, so it's just next level brainwashing.
[1:51:07.160 --> 1:51:14.360]  Right now, let's just say Willie, Erica, Barrett, Michael, Kevin, who's been holding
[1:51:14.360 --> 1:51:21.240]  the longest out of those folks, let's go to Willie in Texas, Willie, thanks for holding.
[1:51:21.240 --> 1:51:22.240]  Hi Alex.
[1:51:22.240 --> 1:51:23.240]  Hey brother.
[1:51:23.240 --> 1:51:26.480]  Everything that you're doing, thanks to the crew, and I just wanted to tell you, you know,
[1:51:26.480 --> 1:51:30.000]  the products are great, been using them for a while, everyone should give them a shot that's
[1:51:30.000 --> 1:51:33.680]  on the fence, they're great stuff, you won't be disappointed.
[1:51:33.680 --> 1:51:36.480]  The other thing I'd like to say is you send out the free bumper sticker with every one
[1:51:36.480 --> 1:51:41.200]  of those orders, I've taken all your bumper stickers and put magnet stripping on the back,
[1:51:41.200 --> 1:51:46.040]  you can get it for a buck at Walmart, you can turn all your info wars stickers into
[1:51:46.040 --> 1:51:49.280]  magnets, so if you're hesitant to put it on your car because it's thicker, you can use
[1:51:49.280 --> 1:51:53.240]  a magnet, put it on your way to where you're going, take it off when you get there if you're
[1:51:53.240 --> 1:51:54.240]  worried about it.
[1:51:54.240 --> 1:51:56.920]  Well that's a smart thing because the left could key you or whatever, if you don't care
[1:51:56.920 --> 1:51:59.920]  that's fine, and conservative areas you'll get your lunchbox for you, other areas you
[1:51:59.920 --> 1:52:00.920]  might get attacked.
[1:52:00.920 --> 1:52:05.200]  In fact, we're going to come out with magnetized bumper stickers very soon at cost, so folks
[1:52:05.200 --> 1:52:09.320]  should do that, put a big old one on the side of your car and then just take it off when
[1:52:09.320 --> 1:52:12.960]  you get there and reach hundreds and hundreds of people if not thousands on a longer trip,
[1:52:12.960 --> 1:52:13.960]  great idea.
[1:52:13.960 --> 1:52:19.440]  I drive into a major downtown city every day, I notice 9.5 cars don't have bumper stickers
[1:52:19.440 --> 1:52:24.080]  and the ones that do are for opposing viewpoints and so we have to have our message out there
[1:52:24.080 --> 1:52:28.480]  amongst everyone just as much, I would love to drive into town and see Trump stickers
[1:52:28.480 --> 1:52:32.720]  and info wars stickers and gateway pundit stickers, I make stickers or sorry magnets
[1:52:32.720 --> 1:52:36.400]  for everything at this point, for different news outlets for people to check out and I
[1:52:36.400 --> 1:52:40.280]  change it on the back of my car like I change my tie, whatever I feel like that day or the
[1:52:40.280 --> 1:52:44.680]  magnets that I put on and so it would be great if people would do this, it's a real world
[1:52:44.680 --> 1:52:51.040]  way to spread the message, you won't be censored and you can be careful of your car, you know
[1:52:51.040 --> 1:52:52.360]  all at the same time.
[1:52:52.360 --> 1:52:56.400]  Well that's right, I saw a slate article today, the one place where Alex Jones will
[1:52:56.400 --> 1:53:00.800]  never be banned and they're very upset that all over the country you see info wars dot
[1:53:00.800 --> 1:53:07.840]  com bumper stickers and Reddit's got a whole subreddit on it, so Hillary from prison info
[1:53:07.840 --> 1:53:12.880]  wars dot com, info wars forbidden information and by the way that's an old bumper sticker
[1:53:12.880 --> 1:53:18.600]  boy is it not forbidden information now, so that's a fun article, they absolutely can't
[1:53:18.600 --> 1:53:23.520]  stand what people are doing, God bless you Willie, great points, okay we're going to
[1:53:23.520 --> 1:53:32.720]  now go to Erika, that's my watch name, Erika in Virginia, Erika thanks for holding her
[1:53:32.720 --> 1:53:33.720]  on the air.
[1:53:33.720 --> 1:53:40.200]  Hi thanks for having me Alex, I had a question about is it possible for Trump to get like
[1:53:40.200 --> 1:53:45.480]  an executive order for Facebook and Google and YouTube to basically abide by the First
[1:53:45.480 --> 1:53:48.440]  Amendment and not you know censorship everybody?
[1:53:48.440 --> 1:53:51.440]  Well here's exactly, here's what needs to happen, they need to have Congress informed
[1:53:51.440 --> 1:53:55.000]  and be briefed with the info we sent the president and Congress and they call them in and they
[1:53:55.000 --> 1:53:58.920]  go really you're not censoring, here's your own WikiLeaks, here's your own admissions,
[1:53:58.920 --> 1:54:02.800]  here's your own search results, here's the studies, stop lying, stop perjuring yourself
[1:54:02.800 --> 1:54:08.000]  and scare the love of God into these people that they should stop doing it and stop lying
[1:54:08.000 --> 1:54:11.560]  about it, they're doing it, they admit they're doing it, but they've been lying to Congress
[1:54:11.560 --> 1:54:16.000]  the last few years and so yeah, he can do executive order, Sherman Antitrust, we need
[1:54:16.000 --> 1:54:19.400]  to have an internet bill of rights passed, we need real net neutrality because Obama
[1:54:19.400 --> 1:54:23.440]  passed laws allowing this, they then repealed them but then it left it as a wild wild west
[1:54:23.440 --> 1:54:30.480]  so big tech took that as a thing to just continue on, so again we don't want regulation but
[1:54:30.480 --> 1:54:35.240]  then letting them regulate by fiat, letting the EU do these billion dollar fines on Facebook
[1:54:35.240 --> 1:54:40.360]  and others to make them do what the EU wants, creates a power vacuum, we need laws saying
[1:54:40.360 --> 1:54:45.240]  no foreign manipulation, they claim it's Russian, the Russians can't even put their shoes on
[1:54:45.240 --> 1:54:49.320]  compared to like the EU and their censorship over here and Google, I'm not putting the
[1:54:49.320 --> 1:54:53.880]  Russians down, they're just not competent like these globalists are at this stuff, at deception
[1:54:53.880 --> 1:54:59.920]  so Congress needs to wake up now and realize this is a popular issue with the constituency
[1:54:59.920 --> 1:55:04.080]  and something that's the whole future of them stopping the globalists throwing them out
[1:55:04.080 --> 1:55:08.520]  of office so, but hey, in the good news now, it's the big central issue, you and I and
[1:55:08.520 --> 1:55:10.600]  all of us together force this out Erica.
[1:55:10.600 --> 1:55:18.880]  Yep, we've been working hard too, my other thing was, is it true about, I had read something
[1:55:18.880 --> 1:55:23.440]  about China was actually the ones that got into the Hillary Clinton emails and there
[1:55:23.440 --> 1:55:27.320]  was no Russian, well I know there was no Russian collusion at all, we know from the
[1:55:27.320 --> 1:55:30.360]  download that's been admitted that it was downloaded on the thumb drives, it wasn't
[1:55:30.360 --> 1:55:34.080]  done to the Russians, it was done by people inside the government, thanks Erica, I appreciate
[1:55:34.080 --> 1:55:37.920]  your call, these are all great crawls, I'm trying to move through everybody here, let's
[1:55:37.920 --> 1:55:42.920]  go ahead and talk to Barrett in California, Barrett in California addressing, fixing
[1:55:42.920 --> 1:55:47.160]  net censorship, I mean it just shows how authoritarian the left is, this should blow up in their
[1:55:47.160 --> 1:55:51.600]  face just politically that everywhere, they already tried to fix the election for Hillary,
[1:55:51.600 --> 1:55:54.840]  it failed, they got caught and now they've quadrupled down, what do you think we should
[1:55:54.840 --> 1:55:55.840]  do Barrett?
[1:55:55.840 --> 1:56:02.760]  Well you know, the director of the CIA William Colby testified publicly in the 70s that they
[1:56:02.760 --> 1:56:08.280]  had hundreds of journalists that were employed by the CIA and he said that they were some
[1:56:08.280 --> 1:56:14.640]  of their greatest assets, so it's kind of naive to think that the CIA's reach has been restricted
[1:56:14.640 --> 1:56:20.360]  to just journalists, it goes, they have their tentacles in the tech industry and everything
[1:56:20.360 --> 1:56:27.480]  and even recently, like people like Ken DeLanian who was with the LA Times, now he's with MSNBC,
[1:56:27.480 --> 1:56:33.480]  they found that he was sending his stories to the CIA for their approval and basically
[1:56:33.480 --> 1:56:35.280]  just signing his name to whatever you wrote.
[1:56:35.280 --> 1:56:42.600]  Yeah, yeah, wasn't he the guy that even went after the web who exposed the CIA drug dealing?
[1:56:42.600 --> 1:56:48.960]  Yeah, yeah, exactly, and there's others like the former editor of the main German Daily
[1:56:48.960 --> 1:56:55.960]  newspaper, Frankfurter Almein Zeitung, he wrote an entire book called Journalists for Hire
[1:56:55.960 --> 1:57:01.960]  which is about his first-hand knowledge of the CIA bribing journalists and giving them
[1:57:01.960 --> 1:57:07.280]  articles and the journalist would just sign their name to it and he died of a heart attack
[1:57:07.280 --> 1:57:09.440]  soon after publishing that book.
[1:57:09.440 --> 1:57:14.160]  Well, sir, I'm so glad, I'm so glad that you brought this up and thanks for the call.
[1:57:14.160 --> 1:57:19.080]  As everybody heard me harping, Obama set up a new operation mockingbird that you mentioned
[1:57:19.080 --> 1:57:24.280]  exposed by Frank Turch's committee in the 1970s, when we come back I'll break all this
[1:57:24.280 --> 1:57:30.640]  down, okay, and yes, it's leftist foundations that plug into the CIA, it's only one small
[1:57:30.640 --> 1:57:34.760]  part of it, not saying that the CIA is good, I'm saying it's a small part of it, who then
[1:57:34.760 --> 1:57:39.960]  do this and Obama set up an office before he left full of these people to shut down
[1:57:39.960 --> 1:57:45.080]  U.S. Free Press and yes, they're paying thousands of fake journalists to attack me and Trump,
[1:57:45.080 --> 1:57:52.320]  this is a CIA operation.

[2:00:15.400 --> 2:00:22.000]  Alex Jones here, back live and we just had a really smart caller, Barrett in California
[2:00:22.000 --> 2:00:25.280]  call in, we're going to continue with calls throughout the hour with Ben Garrison, the
[2:00:25.280 --> 2:00:30.440]  top editorial cartoonist, political cartoonist in the world, hands down, so proud to have
[2:00:30.440 --> 2:00:33.720]  him on, joining us here in just a moment.
[2:00:33.720 --> 2:00:38.720]  But the caller called in and said, well, what about CIA Operation Monkingbird, the hearings
[2:00:38.720 --> 2:00:42.240]  they had in the 70s, Frank Church Committee, people would be naive and I think this is
[2:00:42.240 --> 2:00:43.240]  going on.
[2:00:43.240 --> 2:00:45.120]  It's way beyond that.
[2:00:45.120 --> 2:00:53.080]  The CIA is just the oldest and biggest intelligence agency since the 1947 National Security Act.
[2:00:53.080 --> 2:00:55.160]  It's small potatoes.
[2:00:55.160 --> 2:00:59.280]  The big tax-free foundations, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Rockefeller
[2:00:59.280 --> 2:01:05.960]  Brothers Foundation, the Annenberg Foundation, the Carnegie Foundation, the Ford Foundation,
[2:01:05.960 --> 2:01:11.840]  they are creating the anti-family, confused your children's sexual orientation or preference
[2:01:11.840 --> 2:01:16.400]  they don't know who they are or sexual identity, it's all depopulation.
[2:01:16.400 --> 2:01:20.880]  And so yes, everything you see through UNESCO, the UN, that's all robber barons out of the
[2:01:20.880 --> 2:01:27.360]  UK and the US and Germany that set all this up for the modern eugenics world.
[2:01:27.360 --> 2:01:32.160]  And so when you have Google and Facebook and Twitter meeting with the Democratic Party
[2:01:32.160 --> 2:01:37.320]  and meeting with Senator Warner and meeting with Senator Murphy saying we're going to
[2:01:37.320 --> 2:01:46.000]  not just censor Alex Jones, but thousands of other sites, this is their plan.
[2:01:46.000 --> 2:01:47.800]  This is their program.
[2:01:47.800 --> 2:01:52.760]  And so the caller really punched my button because Obama before leaving office in the
[2:01:52.760 --> 2:02:00.440]  John Warner Defense Authorization Act established in the defense spending bill $611 million,
[2:02:00.440 --> 2:02:06.640]  a large portion for domestic propaganda and ways to work with the quote, mainstream media
[2:02:06.640 --> 2:02:12.760]  to shut down alternative media or fake news, that means us, you.
[2:02:12.760 --> 2:02:18.040]  And so the CIA publicly is at the heart, that's why they had hearings last year in the Armed
[2:02:18.040 --> 2:02:22.800]  Services Committee of the House and Senate, where they would say we're working with the
[2:02:22.800 --> 2:02:25.840]  Board of Governors, the FCC, we're working with trusted media, we're working with the
[2:02:25.840 --> 2:02:32.160]  CIA to shut down fake news and they listed info wars.
[2:02:32.160 --> 2:02:34.000]  And said we were Russians with no evidence.
[2:02:34.000 --> 2:02:37.480]  They don't call me to these hearings, they act like I don't exist, they don't call me
[2:02:37.480 --> 2:02:40.160]  to either, they don't call you.
[2:02:40.160 --> 2:02:43.080]  They just say because you want free market and the Second Amendment and Christianity
[2:02:43.080 --> 2:02:47.280]  in America and support Trump, you're a foreign agent, when they're the globalists say America
[2:02:47.280 --> 2:02:49.560]  was never great, America will never be great.
[2:02:49.560 --> 2:02:53.080]  When they're the ones in bad with the chai comms and opening the borders and saying free
[2:02:53.080 --> 2:02:56.440]  healthcare for illegal aliens, they'll bankrupt the nation, they're the globalists, they're
[2:02:56.440 --> 2:02:57.440]  the enemy.
[2:02:57.440 --> 2:03:02.560]  So I'm gonna put it on the screen again like I do every day for a year and a half.
[2:03:02.560 --> 2:03:06.400]  For TV viewers, all the articles with the video clips were dem lawmakers demands censoring
[2:03:06.400 --> 2:03:10.600]  info wars in the last year and a half and now they've banned us off the platforms as
[2:03:10.600 --> 2:03:11.600]  they demanded.
[2:03:11.600 --> 2:03:15.680]  The Democrats have taken the vacuum that Trump isn't in there stopping their regulation
[2:03:15.680 --> 2:03:21.360]  and they're bullying, we need regulation saying you don't regulate.
[2:03:21.360 --> 2:03:25.040]  And now Trump's moving on antitrust, you name it, thank God of the audience at Drudge Report
[2:03:25.040 --> 2:03:28.440]  and Ben Garrison and everybody else making this a top issue.
[2:03:28.440 --> 2:03:31.720]  So I'm gonna explain it again.
[2:03:31.720 --> 2:03:36.560]  The CIA is tasked along with other federal agencies with organizing media and doling
[2:03:36.560 --> 2:03:43.440]  out money to the New York Times, the Washington Post, BuzzFeed, you name it, this is on record
[2:03:43.440 --> 2:03:47.800]  to lie about me and Trump and to never put out positive news and the president needs
[2:03:47.800 --> 2:03:50.600]  with executive order to shut it down.
[2:03:50.600 --> 2:03:55.000]  But they're like sir, they say it's to fight the Russians, they'll say you shut down, it's
[2:03:55.000 --> 2:03:59.720]  bull, bull, have hearings, show what these criminals are doing.
[2:03:59.720 --> 2:04:04.360]  We have the behind the scenes video of Facebook and Twitter and YouTube and the New York Times
[2:04:04.360 --> 2:04:09.400]  going oh we censor any American flags, any veterans, any rednecks, anything Alex Jones,
[2:04:09.400 --> 2:04:10.400]  anything Trump.
[2:04:10.400 --> 2:04:13.200]  It has nothing to do with Russians.
[2:04:13.200 --> 2:04:17.280]  Last week they had the quote secret telecom to big tech meeting with over 20 companies,
[2:04:17.280 --> 2:04:22.760]  Facebook, Twitter, Google, Microsoft at Twitter headquarters to decide how to handle the elections.
[2:04:22.760 --> 2:04:26.160]  That means panic and how to get their story straight about what they were already doing
[2:04:26.160 --> 2:04:28.040]  to the elections because Trump woke up.
[2:04:28.040 --> 2:04:32.080]  You guys didn't have a sleepwalk into it, we were rung the alarm bell, we got totally
[2:04:32.080 --> 2:04:37.200]  banned because of it, but it's worth it, we're winning, we're staring the debt of freedom
[2:04:37.200 --> 2:04:42.120]  in the eyes, all that we need to do is fight back and understand we will win because Wright
[2:04:42.120 --> 2:04:44.120]  and history is on our side.
[2:04:44.120 --> 2:04:48.640]  So get on board folks, as they say in full metal jacket, come on in for the big win.
[2:04:48.640 --> 2:04:52.520]  Barrett will come back to you and other callers, but we're going with Mr. Garrett, let's just
[2:04:52.520 --> 2:04:56.160]  stay with us, but Garrett's straight ahead.
[2:04:56.160 --> 2:05:00.440]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[2:05:00.440 --> 2:05:04.440]  Info wars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with

[2:06:38.760 --> 2:06:55.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[2:06:55.560 --> 2:07:00.280]  Ben Garrison is our guest, a riding shotgun with collars.
[2:07:00.280 --> 2:07:03.240]  And of course, if you don't know who Ben Garrison is, you're hiding under a rock.
[2:07:03.240 --> 2:07:08.280]  And notice what they came out with this year and how they said we must ban memes in the
[2:07:08.280 --> 2:07:10.240]  EU.
[2:07:10.240 --> 2:07:14.560]  And Facebook must have completely banned them unless they're pre-approved because AI doesn't
[2:07:14.560 --> 2:07:16.480]  know a joke.
[2:07:16.480 --> 2:07:25.200]  They can teach AI to restrict an info wars dot com URL or a drug report dot com URL.
[2:07:25.200 --> 2:07:31.560]  And they can get AI to sit there and block comments, but AI, let's pull up the Ben Garrison
[2:07:31.560 --> 2:07:36.120]  monopoly board piece from a few weeks ago we can.
[2:07:36.120 --> 2:07:42.400]  How does AI looking at a smiling Zuckerberg and a smiling Chinese dictator and smiling
[2:07:42.400 --> 2:07:49.200]  deep state and smiling Google, censoring the internet and censoring conservatives and other
[2:07:49.200 --> 2:07:53.200]  conservatives and nationalists around the world.
[2:07:53.200 --> 2:07:56.200]  What does that look like to AI?
[2:07:56.200 --> 2:08:01.800]  All AI can do is read Ben Garrison.
[2:08:01.800 --> 2:08:04.440]  And we know they admit they were the algorithm trying to block it just because that but it's
[2:08:04.440 --> 2:08:09.120]  not enough because everybody else can then share it plus they can demonize and Alex
[2:08:09.120 --> 2:08:13.640]  Jones you can see me in the jail right there hate speech and then try to block my URL or
[2:08:13.640 --> 2:08:16.880]  have folks shared to share it because they'll get bad feedback but what about Ben Garrison
[2:08:16.880 --> 2:08:21.440]  it's a picture everyone knows it's free speech why not it makes sense it's funny it's banned
[2:08:21.440 --> 2:08:25.520]  in China Google's helped build a censorship search engine there to make fun of the dictator
[2:08:25.520 --> 2:08:30.640]  as Winnie the Pooh for whatever the reasons I guess the way he talks in Chinese sounds
[2:08:30.640 --> 2:08:37.240]  like hello Mr Christopher Waban I guess he lives in the Chinese and so the Chinese think
[2:08:37.240 --> 2:08:44.280]  it's funny Christopher Waban and so they're not allowed to make jokes about it see how
[2:08:44.280 --> 2:08:50.480]  that works you don't talk bad about it he's a very important person in the hundred acre
[2:08:50.480 --> 2:09:01.880]  wood so Ben Garrison of grr graphics graphics dot com at graphics on Twitter for now joins
[2:09:01.880 --> 2:09:05.320]  us we had Barrett I want to go to I want to take calls I hear your smart guy can cover
[2:09:05.320 --> 2:09:11.640]  the field with us but the demonization the insanity the censorship why do you think
[2:09:11.640 --> 2:09:14.920]  it's gone into overdrive I mean I think it's for the midterms and what do you think Trump
[2:09:14.920 --> 2:09:18.960]  should do I mean I'm pretty excited now that they're talking about antitrust they're talking
[2:09:18.960 --> 2:09:23.200]  about racketeering everything we've sent to him in policy reports his notice exactly
[2:09:23.200 --> 2:09:26.800]  what he's doing because we had top law firms do it Ben great to have you back since you
[2:09:26.800 --> 2:09:32.640]  visited a few months ago in Texas yeah it was great to see you down in Texas and I'm
[2:09:32.640 --> 2:09:36.120]  really happy you picked up on the Winnie the Pooh you know that he was trying to the Z
[2:09:36.120 --> 2:09:41.600]  was trying to ban Winnie the Pooh in China because it was used as a meme or kind of a
[2:09:41.600 --> 2:09:48.840]  code coded image representing Z it was like I thought it was hilarious well if Z doesn't
[2:09:48.840 --> 2:09:52.280]  like it then we have to I'm going to start putting Winnie the Pooh pins on him every
[2:09:52.280 --> 2:09:57.720]  time I draw him that's the way it's going to be but you're right I mean it's a collusive
[2:09:57.720 --> 2:10:03.440]  monopoly now with the social media you know we've seen we've seen what's been going on
[2:10:03.440 --> 2:10:07.760]  they've weaponized the Justice Department we got a two-tiered Justice Department where
[2:10:07.760 --> 2:10:12.680]  the left gets off and the conservatives gets prosecuted they weapon they pretty much weaponized
[2:10:12.680 --> 2:10:16.920]  journalism and they weaponize education and universities against conservatives and now
[2:10:16.920 --> 2:10:21.600]  what are they weaponizing now well it's social media because social media is the new town
[2:10:21.600 --> 2:10:28.200]  square and so they have to make sure that conservative voices are banned and we're
[2:10:28.200 --> 2:10:35.040]  going to what they want really is what Z has a Chinese style censored internet where we
[2:10:35.040 --> 2:10:41.520]  have to we have to toe the line the leftist politically correct line and get our social
[2:10:41.520 --> 2:10:46.120]  credits otherwise this is not going to lead to a good end I guarantee you that or pretty
[2:10:46.120 --> 2:10:49.960]  soon we're not going to be able to get on planes because we have a low social credit
[2:10:49.960 --> 2:10:53.680]  which and that's happening in China now they can't board trains if their social standing
[2:10:53.680 --> 2:10:59.680]  is is too low so we have to kind of I hope Trump can somehow nip this in the bud before
[2:10:59.680 --> 2:11:02.640]  it's kind of this is the big issue because this is the mark of the beast even you're
[2:11:02.640 --> 2:11:07.640]  not a Christian this is we already have universities saying if you ever are pro Trump or like Alex
[2:11:07.640 --> 2:11:12.880]  Jones you're being banned from admission lawyers are filing lawsuits over this this is happening
[2:11:12.880 --> 2:11:16.360]  and people say well I'll just won't visit info wars dot commerce for Trump no it's always
[2:11:16.360 --> 2:11:21.240]  going to be more once you give into this it's over they're making their move and as you
[2:11:21.240 --> 2:11:26.080]  said Apple and Google have moved to China and are helping censor things and round up
[2:11:26.080 --> 2:11:30.960]  political dissidents there that shows they'll do that here it shows there's no limit to
[2:11:30.960 --> 2:11:37.320]  these people worth trillions of dollars these companies they are such villains well they
[2:11:37.320 --> 2:11:44.640]  certainly are and you know we saw this last year start when they ban Andrew Anglin and
[2:11:44.640 --> 2:11:50.240]  his daily stormer site now I just buys Andrew Anglin and I don't like Nazis and most Americans
[2:11:50.240 --> 2:11:54.760]  don't so they started with an easy target okay was we're gonna we're not gonna allow
[2:11:54.760 --> 2:12:00.120]  him pay access to PayPal we're not gonna have we're gonna take a site off a go daddy we're
[2:12:00.120 --> 2:12:05.080]  gonna we know we're gonna harass him kick him off everywhere we find and you know this
[2:12:05.080 --> 2:12:10.720]  is the whole crux of the matter we have to protect even unpopular speech I don't think
[2:12:10.720 --> 2:12:18.040]  I think he should pay the consequences if he's doing things illegally but if he is just
[2:12:18.040 --> 2:12:24.320]  having fun with his you know he has a right to his speech just like my wife let him have
[2:12:24.320 --> 2:12:28.480]  his free speech because now what they're doing since they successfully got rid of all the
[2:12:28.480 --> 2:12:34.080]  Nazis they're starting to label conservatives of Nazis and then we get kicked off too that's
[2:12:34.080 --> 2:12:40.000]  their plan well that's the admitted plan we have to protect even unpopular speech such
[2:12:40.000 --> 2:12:46.360]  as that to protect free speech I'll give you one example that I did that that's this has
[2:12:46.360 --> 2:12:50.840]  been going on for a while I mean there was a very good movie made in the in the after
[2:12:50.840 --> 2:12:55.320]  World War II was called the best years of our lives a very good movie very well done
[2:12:55.320 --> 2:12:58.960]  but there's a scene that ruined it and that scene was when the with the sailor with no
[2:12:58.960 --> 2:13:04.760]  hands yet hooks was talking to a guy at the soda fountain and the soda fountain guy told
[2:13:04.760 --> 2:13:08.960]  him well that's too bad you had to lose your hands for nothing because we should have let
[2:13:08.960 --> 2:13:14.440]  those Germans defeat the feet the Reds and the Limies and then of course there's a big
[2:13:14.440 --> 2:13:19.000]  fight and the guy jumped over the soda fountain and punches the guy out and I'm thinking wait
[2:13:19.000 --> 2:13:23.120]  a minute you fought in World War II to protect that guy's free speech and you may not like
[2:13:23.120 --> 2:13:27.640]  it and what he's saying he's being a jerk but you don't all sudden go over the counter
[2:13:27.640 --> 2:13:32.360]  and punch him out because that negates what you were fighting World War II for because
[2:13:32.360 --> 2:13:37.920]  that that's what the Nazis do that's what Antifa does so that that is that that's kind
[2:13:37.920 --> 2:13:43.040]  of set the theme it's like if you got something that's very unpopular oh let's just punch
[2:13:43.040 --> 2:13:47.320]  him out and Hollywood kind of sets that tone well this guy saying something unpopular
[2:13:47.320 --> 2:13:52.280]  free sale punch him out violence and so that's that's kind of like developed into the Antifa
[2:13:52.280 --> 2:13:58.440]  today all they have to do is you know affix the label of a Nazi or fascist on you and
[2:13:58.440 --> 2:14:03.800]  then you're you know you're going to get kicked off sure and folks physically assaulted and
[2:14:03.800 --> 2:14:08.600]  folks know that's going on I think we're now well past that and you're right this is about
[2:14:08.600 --> 2:14:12.720]  banning all conservatives all nationalists all libertarians the dinosaur media that
[2:14:12.720 --> 2:14:17.600]  I see behind you on that calendar knew it was dying knew it was falling apart and the
[2:14:17.600 --> 2:14:22.260]  truth of meteors comments are coming in politically to take them out and so you have a perfect
[2:14:22.260 --> 2:14:27.880]  form of mainstream media with dying political class with foreign funding and then with what
[2:14:27.880 --> 2:14:32.320]  Obama set up with this whole CIA group to counter domestic propaganda that means to shut us
[2:14:32.320 --> 2:14:39.520]  down engage in all this and they're now coming in mass doing this and so I think that's that's
[2:14:39.520 --> 2:14:43.400]  that's really the big issue here and we just have to get Trump mobilized everybody else
[2:14:43.400 --> 2:14:49.840]  to take action yeah I want to read you something really short here that Jack Dorsey tweeted
[2:14:49.840 --> 2:14:56.480]  out a couple weeks ago he says we're committing Twitter to help increase the collective health
[2:14:56.480 --> 2:15:01.080]  openness and civility of public conversation and to hold ourselves publicly accountable

[2:15:19.760 --> 2:15:24.960] able well who determines what's relevant and valuable well he does it's all subjective
[2:15:24.960 --> 2:15:30.280]  is to decide what basically they're get to decide what hate speech is they get to decide
[2:15:30.280 --> 2:15:35.400]  what's relevant they get to decide what's what's something that's moving towards a psychological

[2:20:43.440 --> 2:20:48.760]  graphics designer he's undoubtedly the most successful current modern cartoonist his political
[2:20:48.760 --> 2:20:52.960]  cartoonist in the world and most of you have seen this stuff everywhere they have real trouble
[2:20:52.960 --> 2:20:58.760]  censoring it makes them mad and that's why the e you and others want laws pre controlling
[2:20:58.760 --> 2:21:02.680]  memes where you have to go through a censor before it's allowed i mean this is what they're
[2:21:02.680 --> 2:21:07.080]  asking facebook to do and a lot of what facebook is doing censorship wise is to get in line
[2:21:07.080 --> 2:21:11.920]  with the e you and so trumps like well we don't regulate your private company that's
[2:21:11.920 --> 2:21:16.400]  what congressman like matt gates was saying but the foreign countries are already regulating
[2:21:16.400 --> 2:21:20.680]  the web it's global so they're standardizing here we're going under chinese control their
[2:21:20.680 --> 2:21:25.080]  standards we're going under e you control so what does the president do well well let's
[2:21:25.080 --> 2:21:29.000]  queue up a cudlow was asked are you gonna do something and he said yeah we're looking
[2:21:29.000 --> 2:21:34.000]  at it well i can tell you it's in the news the president has said you're on thin ice
[2:21:34.000 --> 2:22:02.000]  we're coming after you here's cudlow so this is really a good thing that i mean it's in
[2:22:02.000 --> 2:22:06.320]  the news today president's looking at truck antitrust sermon act two when they're looking
[2:22:06.320 --> 2:22:10.880]  this is what they're doing what these tech giants are doing is illegal and i get they
[2:22:10.880 --> 2:22:14.480]  were the new thing the golden boys they do or they want they're now subverting the whole
[2:22:14.480 --> 2:22:18.960]  thing top democrats have come out and admitted this could steal the election for the democrats
[2:22:18.960 --> 2:22:23.880]  what do we need to do because like i get you're a nice guy so you're like liberals don't censor
[2:22:23.880 --> 2:22:28.160]  that's what america's about now stop it they don't care they're authoritarians the average
[2:22:28.160 --> 2:22:32.320]  leftist wants me in prison they scream and go after you russian agent that's what calling
[2:22:32.320 --> 2:22:37.160]  me a martian agent but but they believe it then so i think we've kind of crossed the
[2:22:37.160 --> 2:22:42.040]  rubicon here yeah but they don't they don't scream about hillary and her in her private
[2:22:42.040 --> 2:22:46.960]  server and the chinese having all the secrets hacked and immediately going into their email
[2:22:46.960 --> 2:22:52.840]  depository i mean i i mean i i have a feeling she's probably got paid off for that too i
[2:22:52.840 --> 2:22:57.840]  mean hillary just about money and she's that's her that's her modus operandi selling out
[2:22:57.840 --> 2:23:03.600]  her country for cash but you don't hear any of the the the meet the liberal media the
[2:23:03.600 --> 2:23:08.920]  leftist you know the deep state propaganda organs complaining about that it's always
[2:23:08.920 --> 2:23:14.320]  with the same russia russia russia narrative which has been disproven and even the thing
[2:23:14.320 --> 2:23:19.840]  with the who was a lanny davis that the lawyer for a cohen and saying that that he has proof
[2:23:19.840 --> 2:23:24.040]  that trump was had advanced knowledge and then he later on he backed off and said he
[2:23:24.040 --> 2:23:28.000]  didn't well cnn didn't retract the story did they they doubled down and and still pretend
[2:23:28.000 --> 2:23:33.600]  it was true it's like they they layer like lies upon lies and they lie about the lies
[2:23:33.600 --> 2:23:39.320]  and put whoppers on top of the lies and you know they're so it's it's just gotten crazy
[2:23:39.320 --> 2:23:44.000]  and they they can't stand it that nobody's paying attention to them because they're totally
[2:23:44.000 --> 2:23:50.080]  discredited so instead people are going to you know alternative media on the internet
[2:23:50.080 --> 2:23:55.760]  and then i gotta shut that down and the u n is getting involved too so it's a it's it's
[2:23:55.760 --> 2:24:00.520]  a challenge for us to really stand up against this now before it starts getting worse because
[2:24:00.520 --> 2:24:06.480]  it will get worse if we don't do something about it now and you know if trump can break
[2:24:06.480 --> 2:24:11.280]  up this month this collusive monopoly and introduce something maybe a internet bill
[2:24:11.280 --> 2:24:15.960]  of rights i don't know but i don't i don't trust government getting their grapple hooks
[2:24:15.960 --> 2:24:21.040]  into the internet either because you know once another obama gets into office they will
[2:24:21.040 --> 2:24:25.760]  use that i know that's why it has to be like a bill of rights right you can have regulations
[2:24:25.760 --> 2:24:29.960]  saying like the first amendment congress will make no law respecting the establishment
[2:24:29.960 --> 2:24:34.000]  of religion or prohibit exercise thereof or the free with the press or the right to assemble
[2:24:34.000 --> 2:24:39.080]  position of government for redress of grievances that that's a law that says you can't make
[2:24:39.080 --> 2:24:44.480]  laws these people are free to do this so we need the first amendment act for the internet
[2:24:44.480 --> 2:24:47.760]  that's what it's called the first amendment act saying unless it's illegal like anything
[2:24:47.760 --> 2:24:52.720]  else you don't have regulatory power over it and it's a third party posting you can
[2:24:52.720 --> 2:24:57.600]  have your terms of service and remove it but but only for reasons that violate law you
[2:24:57.600 --> 2:25:04.920]  can't then interpret and project onto it whatever you want that a valet shown says i don't want
[2:25:04.920 --> 2:25:10.320]  transsexuals teaching three-year-olds that they're different sex that is sexualizing
[2:25:10.320 --> 2:25:16.080]  children that that i hate men in drag and clown outfits that's what it is it's that i don't
[2:25:16.080 --> 2:25:20.880]  want heterosexuals homosexuals anybody sexualizing kids they go oh you don't like transsexuals
[2:25:20.880 --> 2:25:27.520]  no i know i'm a libertarian okay i don't like you involved with the kids stop it so they
[2:25:27.520 --> 2:25:31.280]  change the subject show and then they go oh you're off twitter you're off facebook you
[2:25:31.280 --> 2:25:36.160]  bullied transsexuals because they're public figures but they're so special and protected
[2:25:36.160 --> 2:25:42.920]  they get access to your children so then i ask is it lgbtp because you know every time
[2:25:42.920 --> 2:25:47.480]  i say leave the kids alone stop sexualizing them by heterosexuals the catholic church
[2:25:47.480 --> 2:25:54.280]  any of these groups they say oh you're being lgbt phobic and i'm saying if you're adults
[2:25:54.280 --> 2:25:58.400]  doing things in your own bedroom i'm not phobic okay give me a break and it's an obsession
[2:25:58.400 --> 2:26:01.720]  that you think i'm obsessed with what you're doing your bedroom it's boring the point
[2:26:01.720 --> 2:26:06.480]  is is that it's the sexualization of children so they change the subject you see what i'm
[2:26:06.480 --> 2:26:11.400]  saying yeah it's almost completely well it is completely lyrical so if it wasn't if
[2:26:11.400 --> 2:26:19.040]  it weren't so serious what's what this is all leading to so you know we we all have
[2:26:19.040 --> 2:26:24.440]  to start pushing back as hard as we can and don't give up and everybody get on board
[2:26:24.440 --> 2:26:28.560]  and and use your free speech i mean if this was the second amendment if they had control
[2:26:28.560 --> 2:26:34.000]  over that we'd all have our guns gone by now so we have to make sure that we all keep
[2:26:34.000 --> 2:26:37.400]  speaking out loudly i agree and the only reason we have the second is people stand up for
[2:26:37.400 --> 2:26:40.880]  it if people don't fight for the first we're gonna lose everything so let me ask that question
[2:26:40.880 --> 2:26:44.480]  i agree i don't want government involved but let's quantify that for the second if we lose
[2:26:44.480 --> 2:26:48.320]  the second we lose everything but we're starting to lose it anyway but the guns that mean that
[2:26:48.320 --> 2:26:52.440]  is the cornerstone if they get rid of our guns it's over and they're not going to take
[2:26:52.440 --> 2:26:57.560]  mine i don't disagree with you but i believe the founders were right free speech and the
[2:26:57.560 --> 2:27:01.600]  right to assemble is the right to communicate the message to keep the guns so the two go
[2:27:01.600 --> 2:27:04.720]  together that's whether the first and second like a horse and carriage you can argue what's
[2:27:04.720 --> 2:27:09.800]  the horse what's the carriage i think they're both equally co-equal but they're going after
[2:27:09.800 --> 2:27:14.520]  ben garrison they're going after our free speech so what i'm asking you is if the un
[2:27:14.520 --> 2:27:17.840]  and the eu and the chai comms are already coming with regulations because we've left
[2:27:17.840 --> 2:27:22.440]  a vacuum don't we need regulations saying you we have free speech in america it's not a
[2:27:22.440 --> 2:27:29.160]  regulation for laws that oppress it's the opposite well we should be able to i think
[2:27:29.160 --> 2:27:32.800]  we should be able to sue these guys who have all these these billions of dollars when they
[2:27:32.800 --> 2:27:38.040]  start stepping on our free speech but they say that they're like the phone company you
[2:27:38.040 --> 2:27:42.280]  know they they don't regulate the content you can't sue us but then they do regulate
[2:27:42.280 --> 2:27:46.960]  the content and that's what they do so they can't have it both ways so they jump back
[2:27:46.960 --> 2:27:54.320]  and forth yeah they just they've been the they've been the law and been you know they've
[2:27:54.320 --> 2:27:59.280]  been free speech however they like to to to to uh to match their ends and their end is
[2:27:59.280 --> 2:28:03.400]  always the same it's always the collective totalitarian society that they're they're
[2:28:03.400 --> 2:28:11.080]  in charge of and and able to take away more freedom and liberty from us until we're nothing
[2:28:11.080 --> 2:28:15.360]  but just miserable serfs and then that's when the great calling will begin and they'll
[2:28:15.360 --> 2:28:20.360]  they'll just end up you know i say this and i get laughed at by a lot of my lefty friends
[2:28:20.360 --> 2:28:25.520]  but they're going to end up killing us they want to mess a massive uh you know deep up
[2:28:25.520 --> 2:28:29.160]  you don't have the public basically not working from trying to change that and now they hate
[2:28:29.160 --> 2:28:34.280]  us and they're being trained that we are the food and they say within 10 days 95 percent
[2:28:34.280 --> 2:28:39.440]  of people become cannibals but about five days most people become thieves so yeah no
[2:28:39.440 --> 2:28:44.560]  if a meteorite hit and blew out everything and within 15 days there'd be roving bands
[2:28:44.560 --> 2:28:48.720]  running around eating their fellow humans uh we'll be right back with your phone calls
[2:28:48.720 --> 2:28:52.920]  for ben garrison uh bear that some good points and go back to him on media manipulation

[2:33:47.000 --> 2:33:52.320]  I wanted a batman specifically this morning so we're going to show it on tv right now
[2:33:52.320 --> 2:33:57.720]  off my phone because if it happens on my phone it just magically gets out everywhere let's
[2:33:57.720 --> 2:34:01.720]  think about doing a trolling operation where soros text message me good job jones keep
[2:34:01.720 --> 2:34:06.240]  it up in like a split second of it being seen it's like top news story all over the world
[2:34:06.240 --> 2:34:09.480]  and I'm saying that because I'm going to do that troll and people are going to believe
[2:34:09.480 --> 2:34:12.920]  it that I'm going to be able to go back to this and point it out I'm going to do one
[2:34:12.920 --> 2:34:16.960]  with trump too I'm going to wait like a month or something though I'm going to troll the
[2:34:16.960 --> 2:34:21.440]  hell out of it we're back to being garrison and phone calls here in a moment let me pull
[2:34:21.440 --> 2:34:27.600]  it up and text messages here this is the specific one that I want I mean if it is the
[2:34:27.600 --> 2:34:35.480]  same one it doesn't sound like the same one this is the batman original tv theme there
[2:34:35.480 --> 2:34:40.320]  must be like a bunch that say that then because it's not the same one or I'm going crazy I'm
[2:34:40.320 --> 2:34:44.360]  just going crazy I know that first one I heard wasn't it which is whatever I'm I don't care
[2:34:44.360 --> 2:34:49.680]  just remove them all out of the machine then okay doesn't matter what I do want then is
[2:34:49.680 --> 2:34:53.560]  you're out of town a few weeks ago Daria I want those ones I sent of the specific outro
[2:34:53.560 --> 2:34:58.520]  music we'll just do this on air because that's the best place to do everything now I'll start
[2:34:58.520 --> 2:35:02.400]  paying my bills on air I'll start trimming my fingernails on air brushing my teeth on
[2:35:02.400 --> 2:35:07.320]  air it'll all be fine seriously though we ought to be rejoicing more that they've been
[2:35:07.320 --> 2:35:12.320]  trying to hide the censorship like we're complete morons for years it's been getting worse
[2:35:12.320 --> 2:35:19.240]  and worse and now finally it's being exposed Ben garrison undoubtedly the top cartoon political
[2:35:19.240 --> 2:35:23.280]  cartoonist in the world and what other cartoonists are popular now really not a lot I mean he's
[2:35:23.280 --> 2:35:28.960]  really prolific billions of millions of people have seen his work he exposes it all at a
[2:35:28.960 --> 2:35:34.520]  gut level where would you say we are right now 69 days out from this midterm you agree
[2:35:34.520 --> 2:35:41.920]  that it's one of the most important elections ever yeah this is this was a critical but
[2:35:41.920 --> 2:35:50.120]  it's but they're really pulling out all stops at this point to try to turn the tide because
[2:35:50.120 --> 2:35:56.080]  it's been going against them as people have been waking up on mass what Trump what Trump
[2:35:56.080 --> 2:36:01.880]  is doing is not just nationalism in America first he's also de-globalizing the system
[2:36:01.880 --> 2:36:06.640]  and they can't stand that because that's like he's he's tearing back the prop so-called
[2:36:06.640 --> 2:36:11.920]  progress that they've been making for decades on an unimpeded and unencumbered so here is
[2:36:11.920 --> 2:36:20.200]  this kind of a rogue president coming in and he's he's destroying their their sandcastle
[2:36:20.200 --> 2:36:26.880]  kicking it out so what he's doing is of course I'm on that's one of the reasons I like Trump
[2:36:26.880 --> 2:36:30.400]  because it's the decentralized I think we should decentralize a lot of things we need
[2:36:30.400 --> 2:36:37.600]  to decentralize our banking system we need to decentralize the internet we need to you
[2:36:37.600 --> 2:36:41.880]  know bring government back into the hands of people decentralize the you know the education
[2:36:41.880 --> 2:36:48.240]  that everything should be should be more people when you get more local power to the local
[2:36:48.240 --> 2:36:53.120]  people than that the people have more power and that's that sort of ties in with Brexit
[2:36:53.120 --> 2:36:57.480]  when when Britain saw what was going on well wait a minute we're we're paying all these
[2:36:57.480 --> 2:37:02.320]  taxes but we don't have any representation we have oligarchs and Brussels deciding what's
[2:37:02.320 --> 2:37:06.440]  good for us and they've had enough of that and so America needs to have enough of that
[2:37:06.440 --> 2:37:11.560]  too and then start getting our government back and our and our internet back to that
[2:37:11.560 --> 2:37:20.560]  you know that Obama tried to give away well if folks are wondering why info wars is under
[2:37:20.560 --> 2:37:24.840]  such attack nine times out of ten we're the only broadcast that exposes what's really
[2:37:24.840 --> 2:37:28.640]  going on then it comes out later and the globalist can track that back yeah we get ridiculed
[2:37:28.640 --> 2:37:34.480]  we get demonized we get attacked some weak minded people are going to sit there and
[2:37:34.480 --> 2:37:39.240]  see me being demonized and think oh he's losing well George Washington and Thomas Jefferson
[2:37:39.240 --> 2:37:43.880]  were being demonized by the Redcoats you're being demonized by the system that's a badge
[2:37:43.880 --> 2:37:48.760]  of courage we're not trying to win a popularity contest with Hollywood or the Democrats or
[2:37:48.760 --> 2:37:53.120]  the blue blood Republicans and folks need to get that I know most our audience understands
[2:37:53.120 --> 2:37:56.280]  that but some people just don't get it some folks you know that you and I've talked to
[2:37:56.280 --> 2:38:00.200]  her like Jones you're a joke you know you get made fun of everywhere well if you're not
[2:38:00.200 --> 2:38:03.720]  getting attacked and made fun of by the power structure you're not over the target then you
[2:38:03.720 --> 2:38:06.840]  know you know people that have quietly done little things behind the scenes or whatever
[2:38:06.840 --> 2:38:11.600]  that are great and some of its bold they don't get what it's like to be in the arena when
[2:38:11.600 --> 2:38:16.400]  you're a public figure and your name's hanging out there or you were already very successful
[2:38:16.400 --> 2:38:21.320]  I know your whole story you know in major publications and so you became you know a little more libertarian
[2:38:21.320 --> 2:38:26.040]  a little more pro-americana and then they blackballed you from your lucrative you know editorial
[2:38:26.040 --> 2:38:30.040]  cartoons and papers well now you're more successful we've talked about it that you went you know
[2:38:30.040 --> 2:38:35.640]  with your gut and totally weren't controlled but see that's what we're talking about here
[2:38:35.640 --> 2:38:39.200]  yeah I did not get off to a good start Alex because when the trolls went after my cartoons
[2:38:39.200 --> 2:38:44.280]  and started defacing them I just I lost it it's funny I look back at that time where
[2:38:44.280 --> 2:38:48.960]  I wanted to sue everybody and I wanted to you know I would get so angry white hot mad
[2:38:48.960 --> 2:38:53.320]  all day and I you know I was walking around with in a state of fear and anger and that's
[2:38:53.320 --> 2:38:59.160]  a terrible combination of emotion a motion of state to be in but now I look back and
[2:38:59.160 --> 2:39:03.600]  I see these people you know defacing my cartoons and I kind of chuckle it doesn't bother me
[2:39:03.600 --> 2:39:09.520]  in the slightest I wish if anything that our deal taught me some grace you know and I didn't
[2:39:09.520 --> 2:39:15.320]  have much when I started out I mean I just you know when I was when I had this the troll
[2:39:15.320 --> 2:39:20.640]  attack that went on for years I would do anything to make it stop and but now I was like you
[2:39:20.640 --> 2:39:25.760]  know hey I don't care have fun with it but that's only because we work so hard to get
[2:39:25.760 --> 2:39:32.480]  my name out there that people know the difference between the real me and the troll me but you
[2:39:32.480 --> 2:39:37.240]  know yeah let's be clear they put swastikas on stuff it's the same crap they do to me
[2:39:37.240 --> 2:39:41.120]  they put stuff on there you didn't do and try to blame you to get you banned it's just
[2:39:41.120 --> 2:39:45.360]  like Mike Cernovich they now take video where his daughter's in the background comes in
[2:39:45.360 --> 2:39:49.800]  on the live broadcast you know and she's real cute and then they cut the audio in of him
[2:39:49.800 --> 2:39:55.400]  torturing her to try to get him swat team it's what they do folks well when they start
[2:39:55.400 --> 2:39:58.680]  when they start doing what they will like what they did to me a couple weeks ago I can't
[2:39:58.680 --> 2:40:02.240]  a couple days ago I can't prove it it was censorship but boy it sure felt like it when
[2:40:02.240 --> 2:40:06.480]  that plug got pulled and I was dark and they wouldn't give me an answer for nine hours
[2:40:06.480 --> 2:40:10.560]  and then when they finally did they said it was my fault and I oh what you know the site
[2:40:10.560 --> 2:40:14.280]  was working fine now it's something well yeah I talked about this they later said oh you
[2:40:14.280 --> 2:40:20.080]  had too much traffic yeah well that's what they said finally and you know but we've had
[2:40:20.080 --> 2:40:24.880]  a lot of traffic before and we haven't been shut down but we the good thing about this
[2:40:24.880 --> 2:40:30.400]  Alex is I had we've had so many people wanting to help and that is so encouraging to me we
[2:40:30.400 --> 2:40:34.640]  had like I have so much email I haven't been able to answer at all people want to help
[2:40:34.640 --> 2:40:40.920]  both you know sending me donations and and technical advice and approach so we have some
[2:40:40.920 --> 2:40:47.280]  plans now to try to solve this problem so it won't happen again but I had kind of I
[2:40:47.280 --> 2:40:52.400]  kind of like maybe I felt sort of like what you must have felt like when they they are
[2:40:52.400 --> 2:40:59.960]  but you know suddenly and kind of a conclusively pulled the plug on you it's like wow they really
[2:40:59.960 --> 2:41:03.760]  have lost the argument if they're doing that if they're so afraid of what you're saying
[2:41:03.760 --> 2:41:08.520]  that just shows that they're on the wrong side of history that's for sure well then I
[2:41:08.520 --> 2:41:13.320]  love how they denied that it's happening after they launch it they're now saying no one censored
[2:41:13.320 --> 2:41:18.880]  me you know nothing happened no conservatives no libertarians are being censored and we
[2:41:18.880 --> 2:41:24.560]  were already shadow banned 95% plus so once they completely banned me I mean but here's
[2:41:24.560 --> 2:41:28.520]  the problem they're now trying to block videos other people upload that I put up so they're
[2:41:28.520 --> 2:41:33.800]  literally trying to censor everybody else and make sure I'm not there while they lie
[2:41:33.800 --> 2:41:38.160]  about me we'll come right back and I promise Mike Louisiana and others I'll go to your
[2:41:38.160 --> 2:41:42.240]  calls I was good the last hour got a guest on I'm gonna go to your phone calls with

[2:47:22.920 --> 2:47:29.640]  what i had to do i had to do it even though they banned me and demonized me without exception
[2:47:29.640 --> 2:47:40.760]  without exemption i couldn't back down i planned each chartered course i did each careful step
[2:47:40.760 --> 2:47:52.600]  along the byway and more so much more much more than this i did it my way i did it
[2:47:52.600 --> 2:48:01.320]  my way i sure did levels don't like that very much let's go back to ben garrison and i was
[2:48:01.320 --> 2:48:06.040]  a bad boy i i did go with calls at front now i've hogged the time this segment one more with him
[2:48:06.040 --> 2:48:09.960]  we'll take some phone calls right now barrett called back he's been home for 40 something minutes
[2:48:09.960 --> 2:48:14.760]  you brought up the cia and operation monheber which is all admitted it's obama set up this
[2:48:14.760 --> 2:48:19.320]  office of countering propaganda saying that all these domestic right wing groups are russians
[2:48:19.320 --> 2:48:24.760]  and the cia is separate the sub office of democrats just like they have a sub office
[2:48:24.760 --> 2:48:29.800]  in the justice department this cancer is running this against me and everybody else
[2:48:29.800 --> 2:48:35.400]  and big tech's taking orders from them so that's what i'm saying barrett go ahead great point
[2:48:37.000 --> 2:48:42.520]  yeah um the original act was the smith month's act which was passed in 48 that allowed for
[2:48:42.520 --> 2:48:48.520]  propaganda but there are two senators one in the 70s one in the 80s that they put restrictions on it
[2:48:48.520 --> 2:48:54.360]  that made sure that that propaganda wasn't disseminated to yes and obama took those off two years ago
[2:48:55.480 --> 2:49:01.160]  exactly and so now we basically have the us ministry ministry of truth our own propaganda
[2:49:01.160 --> 2:49:08.600]  center and rex tillerson did a good thing in september he actually withheld funding for the
[2:49:08.600 --> 2:49:13.960]  what what's called the global engagement center and as a result a lot of the people that that
[2:49:13.960 --> 2:49:19.800]  worked there quit so i think that's something else that they need to do is to make sure that that
[2:49:19.800 --> 2:49:25.400]  funding is withheld from the global engagement center and that they you know not be allowed
[2:49:25.400 --> 2:49:31.320]  to expand their operations because like you said you could open source all of google search
[2:49:31.320 --> 2:49:36.520]  algorithm do everything but and but they'll still get their tentacles into it if they can
[2:49:36.520 --> 2:49:40.040]  well and they started getting around this again with george w where they would put fake stories
[2:49:40.040 --> 2:49:46.680]  in the foreign press and have them leak back here uh but but but now it is the cia and foundation
[2:49:46.680 --> 2:49:52.120]  funding with soros and media matters literally interfaced in your google in your facebook
[2:49:52.120 --> 2:49:58.120]  in your twitter all colluding until we talk about censorship now one of their laughing at trump
[2:49:58.120 --> 2:50:02.360]  try and us we're just getting around to admitting their censorship it's it's our own government
[2:50:02.360 --> 2:50:08.520]  rogue the democrats still in power acting like trump never got in waging war against the population
[2:50:08.520 --> 2:50:15.000]  it is sensational let's let's put the zero hedge articles up folks and the m4's articles from a
[2:50:15.000 --> 2:50:22.920]  year and a half ago this is the entire kahuna the cia is working against trump not the whole cia
[2:50:23.800 --> 2:50:28.760]  just like 37 angry democrats have a cabal their own office in the justice department doing this
[2:50:28.760 --> 2:50:34.120]  there is a cia office obama created working against trump and the free press that's the
[2:50:34.120 --> 2:50:41.080]  headline i mean you cannot make this up and i deal with it these aren't wall street journal in new
[2:50:41.080 --> 2:50:49.560]  york times reporters these are cia weird sjw foundation people they're literally on my ass 24
[2:50:49.560 --> 2:50:56.200]  seven lying and they follow me around everywhere and they hate my guts man their ideologues weird
[2:50:56.200 --> 2:51:01.160]  crazy chip on their shoulder crazy leftist people say oh my god are you scared i'm only scared they're
[2:51:01.160 --> 2:51:05.720]  going to win for you and your family i love it are you kidding i want to take on these people i
[2:51:05.720 --> 2:51:10.360]  want to be at the front of the line i want to be in the war baby you can't get me out of this
[2:51:10.360 --> 2:51:15.080]  but i want to win i'm not scared of them but i'm scared of losing ben do you imagine maybe
[2:51:15.080 --> 2:51:19.400]  and you're a great gravitas you should have a limited edition poster with us or something but
[2:51:19.400 --> 2:51:23.800]  but but we also put out viral how do you describe that they're stay behind networks in the justice
[2:51:23.800 --> 2:51:29.320]  department in the bureaucracy of the cia and the board of governors of the fcc admitting they want
[2:51:29.320 --> 2:51:35.240]  to ban all conservatives and steal the election that is so criminal well that's another reason
[2:51:35.240 --> 2:51:40.200]  to start breaking them up i mean the fbi and the cia are so politicized we need to do what
[2:51:40.200 --> 2:51:47.560]  kennedy wanted to do is start atomizing them and and start uh you know removing them from their
[2:51:47.560 --> 2:51:51.080]  you know there's a there's kind of a subtle difference between the deep state and the shadow
[2:51:51.080 --> 2:51:56.760]  government you hear that all the time well the deep state can be epitomized by people like um
[2:51:56.760 --> 2:52:03.000]  you know stroke who's there as a career fbi man pulling the levers of power no matter what president
[2:52:03.000 --> 2:52:07.960]  is in there and they and then after a while they get used to having wielding that power
[2:52:07.960 --> 2:52:13.160]  and slanting it to their own ends and that and that's what's happened to the cia and the fbi
[2:52:13.160 --> 2:52:19.400]  they're not they're they're interested in in maintaining their own bureaucratic power rather
[2:52:19.400 --> 2:52:25.160]  than doing things that are good for the country oh look at this marmy guy i mean come on i mean
[2:52:25.160 --> 2:52:31.960]  that's that's the deep state face golem doesn't look this evil from lord of the rings so well
[2:52:31.960 --> 2:52:35.240]  and then the shadow government is something a little bit different now and i think of the
[2:52:35.240 --> 2:52:39.640]  shadow government i think more of like you know what you were talking about with all the foundations
[2:52:39.640 --> 2:52:46.920]  and the bill de berg and the cfr uh people who are also unelected yeah they're the ones in charge
[2:52:46.920 --> 2:52:50.840]  and then the deep state pulls the levers you just said it yeah but that yeah that's a pretty good
[2:52:50.840 --> 2:52:55.640]  way of putting it but that the caller you just had on right they made some really good points and
[2:52:56.680 --> 2:53:02.520]  boy it's one thing what they did to you alex is that one thing that may be a little bit positive
[2:53:02.520 --> 2:53:08.440]  of it is they've laid their cards on the table and those cards are ugly and that they've really made
[2:53:08.440 --> 2:53:13.560]  their intentions clear and and if they're going to go to a chinese style internet with social
[2:53:13.560 --> 2:53:16.920]  reputation scores i mean where's that going to lead up pretty soon it's going to be well
[2:53:16.920 --> 2:53:21.080]  well you know you didn't properly worship satan so you're going to get a lot of points
[2:53:21.080 --> 2:53:25.880]  well that's it exactly they make it sound reasonable at front and then next it's this this and that
[2:53:25.880 --> 2:53:30.040]  i want to go to michael's they've got a great idea coordinated free speech rallies they kick us out of
[2:53:30.040 --> 2:53:35.800]  the fourth dimension or silicon dimension we go absolutely wild politically not violently
[2:53:35.800 --> 2:53:41.000]  in the third dimension and then put it online as well they can't stop us all michael go ahead
[2:53:41.000 --> 2:53:49.400]  hey alex uh listen i was i had an idea i was wondering what you thought about it um
[2:53:49.400 --> 2:53:55.720]  what if you get like guys like gavin mcginnis you know brandon tatum michael savage and culture
[2:53:56.600 --> 2:54:01.800]  mylo there's a bunch of people all together maybe even shone hannity and tuck across them
[2:54:01.800 --> 2:54:07.160]  maybe even just get as many people together and show that we're going to stand up against this
[2:54:07.160 --> 2:54:12.120]  that's a smart thing conservatives tend to be rogue on their own you know kind of hourly that's
[2:54:12.120 --> 2:54:16.680]  how i am i mean i'm very reclusive personally i go out to eat here and there but i'm not into you
[2:54:16.680 --> 2:54:20.760]  know running around at events trying to get all those folks to come out together it would be hard
[2:54:20.760 --> 2:54:24.760]  but everybody should hold their own people that want to work together should come together i agree
[2:54:24.760 --> 2:54:29.640]  we need to march on google we need to march on facebook we need to march on all these groups
[2:54:29.640 --> 2:54:34.840]  and say we know what you're doing instead of dc they ignore you there we need to march in san francisco
[2:54:34.840 --> 2:54:38.920]  we need to march in berkeley we need to march in seattle we need to march everywhere and show
[2:54:38.920 --> 2:54:43.400]  the ante if i come out and try to stop us from calling for free speech i think it's a great idea
[2:54:43.400 --> 2:54:49.560]  michael that's the best idea yet i was even thinking maybe you could call it you know free
[2:54:49.560 --> 2:54:54.360]  conservative speech rally or something how about just to fend the first amendment you'll save free
[2:54:54.360 --> 2:55:02.120]  speech rally for everybody yeah yeah yeah that by the way sin michael a free t-shirt of his choice
[2:55:02.120 --> 2:55:06.440]  let's get his name and number or you know his email because michael you had the best idea
[2:55:06.440 --> 2:55:14.280]  we need to hit the streets go ahead michael yeah um i would love to see i mean i would be willing
[2:55:14.280 --> 2:55:19.720]  to travel as far as it needs as far as i need to to make you know to be part of that because
[2:55:19.720 --> 2:55:24.760]  we all have to stand up against this it's it's we can't no i agree and we need to do it soon we
[2:55:24.760 --> 2:55:30.040]  need to do it soon we need to do it soon because because we're 69 days out god bless you michael
[2:55:30.040 --> 2:55:33.880]  put him on hold and i'm gonna give him i have this rule he should hold more than an hour get a free
[2:55:33.880 --> 2:55:39.480]  t-shirt but in terms of this whole situation but michael thank you god bless you uh ben garrison
[2:55:39.480 --> 2:55:43.800]  i think that's the key here is put out memes because the ai has trouble blocking those they
[2:55:43.800 --> 2:55:50.440]  admit that so you're the solution and also marching is the solution lawsuits are the solution calling
[2:55:50.440 --> 2:55:54.200]  congress for them to take action as a solution what do you think the number one solution is
[2:55:54.200 --> 2:55:59.640]  take action period i like to march for one thing um of course the mainstream media
[2:55:59.640 --> 2:56:05.960]  would not show that on there on there any of their uh outlets but we don't all the little folks with
[2:56:05.960 --> 2:56:11.080]  live stream making a big post it's like whack-a-mole they can't get us all we're right now of course
[2:56:11.080 --> 2:56:14.680]  you know if they shut down my free speech i can't really do much out here in the boonies i guess i
[2:56:14.680 --> 2:56:19.080]  could i still have free speech but i go outside and talk to a tree or something but let's be clear
[2:56:19.080 --> 2:56:22.760]  you are memes are so king and you're the king of those because yours is the best work
[2:56:23.480 --> 2:56:27.880]  archetypally because you could just send it to me or anybody else they could ban your facebook
[2:56:27.880 --> 2:56:32.440]  or twitter everyone you could just send it to a list of a hundred people bend garrison cartoons
[2:56:32.440 --> 2:56:36.920]  look they fear the meme they've looked at numbers and they know even if they shut the web down
[2:56:36.920 --> 2:56:42.360]  people could put out their own memes and own posters and in a shutdown thing those are like gold
[2:56:42.360 --> 2:56:47.160]  right now there's so much info people like oh i don't care but more and more it's precious you see
[2:56:47.160 --> 2:56:52.600]  ben they yes ben have you looked it up the EU says they fear one thing memes and they they talk about
[2:56:52.600 --> 2:56:58.760]  you you do you understand that brother the ai doesn't get jokes it doesn't know how to block you ben
[2:57:00.680 --> 2:57:07.320]  they don't get uh you know what they don't get is distilled a distillation of verbal metaphors
[2:57:07.320 --> 2:57:11.320]  individual metaphors and then that's that's one thing they fear because that's the something
[2:57:11.320 --> 2:57:16.920]  it's like what hillary going after pepe the frog i mean come on why was she so afraid of a frog of
[2:57:16.920 --> 2:57:24.120]  a cartoon frog and that really made her look bad but she but her but her worry was maybe founded
[2:57:24.120 --> 2:57:29.240]  in a little bit because that that that frog that one you know which you know matt fairy will sue
[2:57:29.240 --> 2:57:34.520]  you now if you use it but that one was had a played a very critical part in the election didn't it
[2:57:35.160 --> 2:57:41.960]  because he really humiliated her exactly the key is iconography we must use the weapon systems of

[3:00:45.800 --> 3:00:49.800]  i think it was back to rome and ancient china when they had that i've got like 30 more phone
[3:00:49.800 --> 3:00:53.400]  calls and i apologize for not getting everybody but i appreciate you trying to get in uh let's go
[3:00:53.400 --> 3:00:59.320]  to jesse next in idaho jesse you're on the air alex how you doing today good brother
[3:01:00.520 --> 3:01:04.920]  hey uh so i noticed that one of your viewpoints or your main viewpoint has been a false flag
[3:01:04.920 --> 3:01:10.120]  for the silencing i kind of feel like a false flag might play into trump's narrative of uh
[3:01:10.120 --> 3:01:14.920]  strengthening the borders and uh the second amendment but one thing i did notice is that
[3:01:15.640 --> 3:01:20.920]  just before the silencing trump had come out about releasing a lot of the redacted information
[3:01:20.920 --> 3:01:26.040]  in the memos the question to you is do you think that they might be going in defense mode in
[3:01:26.040 --> 3:01:30.920]  preparation for something big coming to the white house that would be devastating to the democrats
[3:01:30.920 --> 3:01:35.960]  absolutely they know trump's getting ready to declassify everything uh they know the economy's
[3:01:35.960 --> 3:01:39.960]  coming back they don't people talking about that and so they want to censor everybody and use my
[3:01:39.960 --> 3:01:46.040]  censoring as a smoke stream while we all debate alex jones instead they're they're basically
[3:01:46.040 --> 3:01:50.440]  censoring everybody else so yeah no that's exactly what's going on and i told everybody
[3:01:50.440 --> 3:01:56.200]  this three weeks ago and now it's happened yeah definitely and uh you know it's not just the
[3:01:56.200 --> 3:02:00.440]  big guys that are being silent too it's just uh small people like me that share your guys's
[3:02:00.440 --> 3:02:04.280]  information i've been banned off of just uh little sites and stuff like that and they're trying to
[3:02:04.280 --> 3:02:08.920]  teach you hey you sit out and you shut up jessey but don't stop do it even more because you're
[3:02:08.920 --> 3:02:14.520]  winning call into c-span call another talk shows uh knock on doors hand out flyers start your own
[3:02:14.520 --> 3:02:21.160]  website cover local news build your own internet uh because again mainstream internet's like 90%
[3:02:21.160 --> 3:02:27.000]  of it like matt dredge warned we have to pull it back like 10 years ago 80% of the web was
[3:02:27.000 --> 3:02:32.760]  individual websites we have to go back to that jessey god bless him what do you think they're
[3:02:32.760 --> 3:02:37.080]  clamping down on i i think it's the midterms i mean i i mean they admit in their own memos they're
[3:02:37.080 --> 3:02:42.360]  doing this to try to make sure the democrats win they're scared yeah they're trying to do that all
[3:02:42.360 --> 3:02:49.160]  right um the the thing about the media is there well one thing is i've noticed that they're they're
[3:02:49.160 --> 3:02:54.520]  starting to leverage toward uh the media's trying to push a war with iran that's very dangerous they
[3:02:54.520 --> 3:02:58.280]  couldn't it couldn't get a hillary end to start a war with russia so now they're trying to justify
[3:02:58.280 --> 3:03:03.720]  the 700 million dollar 700 billion annual budget on the military with a war with iran and i that's
[3:03:03.720 --> 3:03:13.560]  that's a side issue maybe but um there there here's the deal alex um i was talking to my 87
[3:03:13.560 --> 3:03:19.080]  year old mom the other day and she says i wish we could go back to old days with walter krankite now
[3:03:19.080 --> 3:03:24.920]  he was so reliable and you could believe what he told you and i kind of like uh no he sat at the
[3:03:24.920 --> 3:03:31.240]  right hand of satan and walter krankite actually he wanted he he presented himself as a man you
[3:03:31.240 --> 3:03:35.480]  can trust but what he wanted he wanted world government and population reduction exactly i had
[3:03:35.480 --> 3:03:39.960]  to explain the tour i said america they wanted americans to yield their sovereignty that has
[3:03:39.960 --> 3:03:45.800]  never changed the mainstream media the the legacy media the you know the the deep state propaganda
[3:03:45.800 --> 3:03:53.960]  media they still want to erode the the sovereignty of citizens of the united states and replace it
[3:03:54.760 --> 3:04:00.200]  with a globalist system and that has not changed and that trump really threw a monkey wrench into
[3:04:00.200 --> 3:04:05.080]  their plans and and they're gonna be driving hard to the hoop to stop him how and the globalist system
[3:04:05.080 --> 3:04:11.000]  they're bringing in whatever it takes exactly late censorship that's what they're they missed the
[3:04:11.000 --> 3:04:16.040]  days of walter krankite when they could get a grandfather kind grandfatherly man with them
[3:04:16.040 --> 3:04:22.680]  with a nice molyphilus voice to tell you what's true while he sat there and spouted out the lies
[3:04:23.960 --> 3:04:27.880]  but nobody realized it back then did they now we have an internet where we could find the truth so
[3:04:27.880 --> 3:04:32.040]  now they have to shut that down you just reminded me we have the clip somewhere we can dig it out
[3:04:32.040 --> 3:04:36.040]  of our computers where walter krankite says there are those that claim that world government
[3:04:36.040 --> 3:04:40.120]  is the work of satan well then i'm happy to sit here at the right hand of satan thank you david
[3:04:40.120 --> 3:04:45.480]  rockefeller then let's talk soon because i got a bunch of stuff i want to do with you i know you've
[3:04:45.480 --> 3:04:49.560]  been busy i've been busy but you're just great work we salute the work you're doing people can
[3:04:49.560 --> 3:04:55.640]  find you at your great website that's up on uh graphics we knew it was coming the whole thing
[3:04:55.640 --> 3:05:01.720]  was for me leg first demonize info wars lie about us build a straw man then sue us to add
[3:05:01.720 --> 3:05:07.160]  credibility to that then have a few fake strikes on youtube and facebook with nebulous terms like
[3:05:07.160 --> 3:05:14.520]  bullying children and islamophobia and then voila two weeks later ban info wars completely off of
[3:05:14.520 --> 3:05:21.800]  dozens of major platforms where we were all in the top five or top ten news feeds go to info wars

[3:05:52.680 --> 3:06:08.760]  don't want you to see well i think i see another side maybe
[3:06:23.320 --> 3:06:34.760]  maybe
[3:06:41.640 --> 3:06:44.280]  by the way ben garrison just reminded me of something
[3:06:45.480 --> 3:06:49.960]  walter kronkite on c span said there are those that say world governments the work of satan
[3:06:49.960 --> 3:06:53.080]  so i'm glad to sit here at the right hand of satan he was with david rockefeller
[3:06:53.800 --> 3:06:57.160]  this is a world government that takes your rights takes your freedoms for corporations
[3:06:57.160 --> 3:07:03.080]  or tax exempt but you're not and there's a total panopticon internet that controls every action
[3:07:03.080 --> 3:07:08.040]  you are involved in and then penalizes you if you don't go along with what their world view is
[3:07:08.040 --> 3:07:14.040]  which means one child policies no child policies you name it see once you agree to the world social
[3:07:14.040 --> 3:07:19.640]  score that sounds reasonable oh i just got to do whatever ms nbc says we're seeing in then it's
[3:07:19.640 --> 3:07:25.160]  more more more it's social control so i'm in a right shotgun and we're gonna have to start the
[3:07:25.160 --> 3:07:30.200]  next segment that video for you but anybody can pull it up until youtube deletes it just type in
[3:07:30.200 --> 3:07:35.880]  onto youtube.com the good old folks there kronkite glad to sit at the right hand of satan it's one
[3:07:35.880 --> 3:07:40.760]  minute five seconds long the larger one join me i'm glad to sit the right hand of satan
[3:07:40.760 --> 3:07:46.280]  1.3 k views it means 10 billion views and there's another one join me at the right hand of satan
[3:07:46.280 --> 3:07:52.680]  that actually has him introducing hillary clinton with her on the screen saying she is safe and see
[3:07:52.680 --> 3:07:56.600]  i've got all these videos that are admitting world government how they're going to get rid of the
[3:07:56.600 --> 3:08:01.640]  family everything and so it's funny that he raised that because it made me remember something
[3:08:01.640 --> 3:08:08.680]  i hadn't covered in years and years and years and years now mike adams is going to be hosting
[3:08:08.680 --> 3:08:15.800]  this hour uh roger stone has a big breaking news announcement uh here and then he is going to be
[3:08:15.800 --> 3:08:19.640]  gone because he had oral surgery or staying he is in a lot of pain we appreciate him coming on
[3:08:19.640 --> 3:08:24.360]  i was this is such big news uh that he wouldn't be here unless it was an emergency breaking news
[3:08:24.360 --> 3:08:31.080]  so roger thank you for joining us today great to be here alex i apologize if i'm slurring my words
[3:08:31.080 --> 3:08:37.960]  a little bit i haven't been hitting the moonshine i'm still getting over the anesthetic but uh this
[3:08:37.960 --> 3:08:44.920]  is important and i had to make the show tell us the big breaking news my friend well on
[3:08:44.920 --> 3:08:52.520]  monday i joined the alex joneshow and we broke down a an action plan for the president of the
[3:08:52.520 --> 3:09:00.120]  united states now the president has moved on the very first step of our plan which is to discharge
[3:09:00.760 --> 3:09:09.720]  white house counsel don mcgan now don mcgan is the john dean of this administration don mcgan sat
[3:09:09.720 --> 3:09:18.200]  for 30 hours of interviews with robert moeller and his gum shoes don mcgan i can now report
[3:09:18.200 --> 3:09:24.280]  has been the greatest single obstacle to the termination of jeff sessions the greatest single
[3:09:24.280 --> 3:09:30.680]  obstacle to the declassification of all the government documents regarding the illegal
[3:09:30.680 --> 3:09:39.000]  fiso warrants hillary clinton's emails of the emails that whom i abed in forwarded to anthony weiner
[3:09:39.000 --> 3:09:45.720]  don mcgan has been an establishment quisling inside the walls of the trump white house and now
[3:09:45.720 --> 3:09:53.240]  the president announced by a tweet that mcgan would be leaving in the fall well to me we're in
[3:09:53.240 --> 3:10:01.000]  the fall it'll be september 1st here momentarily and i think this is vitally important but what
[3:10:01.000 --> 3:10:07.720]  was disturbing most of all was chuck grassley who i have great admiration for the chairman of the
[3:10:07.720 --> 3:10:13.320]  senate judicia community taking a tweet and saying oh i hope this isn't true i hope the president
[3:10:13.880 --> 3:10:20.200]  is not going to discharge mcgan now alex the white house staff the white house counsel
[3:10:20.200 --> 3:10:25.800]  hope serves at the pleasure of the president of the united states not the chairman of the senate
[3:10:25.800 --> 3:10:31.800]  judiciary committee in fact even suggesting who the president should and should not hire
[3:10:31.800 --> 3:10:37.880]  should and should not fire is a violation of the separation of powers provided for in our
[3:10:37.880 --> 3:10:42.440]  us constitutions well sure next we're going to hear congress say we want to pass a law that
[3:10:42.440 --> 3:10:48.040]  you can't fire again and as you said on monday fire mcgan then fire four deep in the justice
[3:10:48.040 --> 3:10:52.920]  department then any trust moves and that's all being announced by the president it's not just
[3:10:52.920 --> 3:10:57.480]  that we're advising him we've gone to top law firms we do real research we had mike adams
[3:10:57.480 --> 3:11:01.160]  write a report to the president i know god to him that made reportedly somebody at the white
[3:11:01.160 --> 3:11:07.080]  house go really ape trump's finally said resign if you want he knows the truth he's decided to go
[3:11:07.080 --> 3:11:12.520]  into a war footing with the news they're planning to indict his son and now even the former head
[3:11:12.520 --> 3:11:19.000]  of the cia and nsa hayden says back off moeller back off brennan trump has all the power he has
[3:11:19.000 --> 3:11:24.120]  the people the economy's growing we're going to lose this and and you know trump's told people
[3:11:24.120 --> 3:11:28.200]  last night at the prayer of dinner to buckle up for violence the left's coming so i think
[3:11:28.200 --> 3:11:32.840]  trump gets it now and realizes these folks didn't want prosperity they don't want trillions more
[3:11:32.840 --> 3:11:38.840]  in the stock market they want control of america and so now he has put on the armor of god and
[3:11:38.840 --> 3:11:43.160]  is and they are now crapping their collective drawers roger i mean this is a i mean why is it
[3:11:43.160 --> 3:11:47.400]  word for word we're advising is now happening because we did our research and yes we're able
[3:11:47.400 --> 3:11:51.960]  to talk to the president through sources and but i mean it's all happening it's manifesting
[3:11:51.960 --> 3:11:59.720]  this is epic stone well in additionally troubling was uh yesterday when the senate majority leader
[3:12:00.280 --> 3:12:06.440]  came out and urged the president not to fire jeff sessions now while that is true that the
[3:12:06.440 --> 3:12:13.560]  us senate has confirmation authority who the president appoints or fires is none of senator
[3:12:13.560 --> 3:12:18.440]  mcconnell's business in fact mr president not only should you appoint a new attorney general
[3:12:18.440 --> 3:12:23.480]  but you should order him to look into the chinese business dealings of senator mcconnell and his
[3:12:23.480 --> 3:12:30.120]  wife who is unfortunately a member of the trump cabinet the longest serving member of the george
[3:12:30.120 --> 3:12:36.440]  w butch cabinet now serves as transportation secretary does it this signal roger that trump is
[3:12:36.440 --> 3:12:41.560]  getting ready to to to to to politically chopping heads off the fact that he's got the white house
[3:12:41.560 --> 3:12:45.560]  chief council going the fact that he says he's taking the gloves off that it's illegal that
[3:12:45.560 --> 3:12:50.600]  they're on thin ice with google i mean people better know trump means business now well it's
[3:12:50.600 --> 3:12:56.760]  like an ocean liner you know it takes some time to turn uh let's recognize the president is completely
[3:12:56.760 --> 3:13:03.080]  surrounded by advisors who have urged him not to take action not to do anything about internet
[3:13:03.080 --> 3:13:08.840]  censorship not to do anything about a runaway justice department that is under the control
[3:13:08.840 --> 3:13:15.080]  of the obama administration not to do anything about the stunning criminal rod rozenstein
[3:13:15.800 --> 3:13:22.520]  the president i think finally recognizes that his survival the survival of his presidency
[3:13:22.520 --> 3:13:29.640]  is at stake but alex it took the president doing a google search on himself to figure out what's
[3:13:29.640 --> 3:13:35.240]  going on at google to figure out that that all of the search as he said there's nothing about 4.6
[3:13:35.240 --> 3:13:44.120]  growth rate there's nothing about it's all negative crap 3.2 million new jobs i might even be low it
[3:13:44.120 --> 3:13:51.960]  may be 3.4 i'm a little woozy but compare that with the massive job loss of barack obama in
[3:13:51.960 --> 3:13:59.320]  two years the president has cut the deficit virtually in half from around 900 billion
[3:13:59.320 --> 3:14:05.960]  to around five and change that's progress but you won't find that if you do a google search i
[3:14:05.960 --> 3:14:11.800]  know you see in closing mike adams is coming up roger but i mean this is so epic and people
[3:14:11.800 --> 3:14:16.920]  overuse the word epic this is so crazy that that they always act like they want to work with him
[3:14:16.920 --> 3:14:20.520]  and they stab him in the back and all these career politicians are cowards around him
[3:14:20.520 --> 3:14:25.080]  but his instincts are right i think what you're saying is this signifies as you said on monday
[3:14:25.640 --> 3:14:30.680]  just three days ago two days ago he is getting ready to move and boy are they getting scared
[3:14:30.680 --> 3:14:35.560]  what do you make of swamp creatures like clapper and and hayden sing leave him alone oh my god he's
[3:14:35.560 --> 3:14:40.600]  got the power you went too far stop stop i think they realize now that they're in trouble if he
[3:14:40.600 --> 3:14:47.640]  takes action well a terrific piece by peter schweitzer at bright bar i think late last week
[3:14:47.640 --> 3:14:55.720]  clapper brennan hayden these guys make multi millions of dollars out of having their security
[3:14:55.720 --> 3:15:01.800]  clearance because it gives them an enormous bank of knowledge about what's going around the world
[3:15:01.800 --> 3:15:07.640]  so they're moving to protect their dairy airs financially and i think they recognize that
[3:15:07.640 --> 3:15:14.920]  donald trump is a man that you can push only so far if i were brennan i would face up to the fact
[3:15:14.920 --> 3:15:20.360]  that he's going to be wearing an orange jumpsuit for most of the rest of his life uh because he
[3:15:20.360 --> 3:15:25.000]  has crossed a patriot no brennan we got to go further stay there and i'm going to have mike
[3:15:25.000 --> 3:15:27.400]  adams take over in question when we come back for one more second then mike's got his own
[3:15:27.400 --> 3:15:32.200]  undercover but little ladies and gentlemen this is an epic time to be alive this is incredible
[3:15:32.200 --> 3:15:38.120]  mike adams naturalnews.com takes over with roger stone but i want to ask roger via mike adams this
[3:15:38.120 --> 3:15:44.200]  question how soon does he start firing we have graham we have grassley sing go ahead and fire
[3:15:44.200 --> 3:15:49.880]  sessions how long until the the firings happen how does deep state strike back straight ahead
[3:15:53.080 --> 3:15:57.720]  healthcare reform is confusing but whether it's finding an affordable insurance plan keeping your
[3:15:57.720 --> 3:16:02.760]  doctor or being able to afford needed prescriptions navigating the healthcare system has become a

[3:22:26.440 --> 3:22:33.480]  that's going to be too many a bitter pill today we must develop federal structures on a global
[3:22:33.480 --> 3:22:41.240]  level to deal with world problems we need a system of enforceable world law a democratic federal
[3:22:41.240 --> 3:22:47.720]  world government most important we should sign and ratify the treaty for a permanent international
[3:22:47.720 --> 3:22:55.400]  criminal court pat robertson has written in a book a few years ago that we should have a world
[3:22:55.400 --> 3:23:04.840]  government but only when the messiah arrives he wrote and literally any attempt to achieve world
[3:23:04.840 --> 3:23:13.320]  order before that time must be the work of the devil well join me i'm glad to sit here at the
[3:23:13.320 --> 3:23:21.000]  right hand of satan now i'm turning this over to mike adams and roger stone but remember
[3:23:21.000 --> 3:23:25.000]  we've now informed trump about the internet takeover it's all admitted they think we're idiots
[3:23:25.000 --> 3:23:29.720]  the cia not the whole cia but just like the justice department a small group the cabal
[3:23:30.360 --> 3:23:35.320]  was established in the countering foreign propaganda act and they say info wars roger stone
[3:23:35.320 --> 3:23:39.560]  it's all in their congressional hearings counter us so they set up billions of dollars in the
[3:23:39.560 --> 3:23:45.000]  in the defense authorization act almost two years ago under obama and put up the articles
[3:23:45.560 --> 3:23:51.240]  to shut everybody down to engage in censorship and to set up trusted media like the new york times
[3:23:51.240 --> 3:23:56.680]  washington post cnn media matters that's what they call it trusted to then censor us and be the
[3:23:56.680 --> 3:24:04.920]  censor controllers so the cia rogue democrat officers and the cia created a secret shadow office
[3:24:05.560 --> 3:24:11.800]  it's secret they do the funding is public to then throw elections and block populism that's the
[3:24:11.800 --> 3:24:17.240]  next phase is for trump to remove that and that's why i've been completely banned now back to mike
[3:24:17.240 --> 3:24:24.600]  adams and roger stone with huge breaking news tomorrow's news today thank you alex it's great
[3:24:24.600 --> 3:24:29.240]  to join you and great to have you on roger as we continue here you know we're in the middle of an
[3:24:29.240 --> 3:24:37.000]  epic uprising now against text censorship and what we call the evil centralization false authority
[3:24:37.000 --> 3:24:41.640]  this concentration of power in the hands of the unelected few but roger while you're with us in
[3:24:41.640 --> 3:24:48.440]  this segment let's continue about your breaking news today the maneuvers in the white house now
[3:24:48.440 --> 3:24:54.200]  a question for you right now do you think trump will wake up in time and take aggressive action
[3:24:54.760 --> 3:24:59.240]  before the midterm elections or is he going to listen to his advisors that are surrounding him
[3:24:59.240 --> 3:25:04.280]  and telling him to delay delay because he might lose the election if he if he gets
[3:25:04.280 --> 3:25:08.440]  decisive right now i mean you and i both think he should go for it now but what do you think
[3:25:08.440 --> 3:25:13.960]  is actually going to happen roger well uh mike first of all let me thank you for jumping into
[3:25:13.960 --> 3:25:20.040]  the chair today i'm i'm uh i'm suffering a bit with a tooth extraction but i'm still glad to be
[3:25:20.040 --> 3:25:25.800]  with you uh you know it's an open question mike i have to be quite honest about it what the president
[3:25:25.800 --> 3:25:33.160]  needs to do is not only act decisively but make this election a referendum on his actions take
[3:25:33.160 --> 3:25:39.240]  your argument right to the people don't just fire sessions rozenstein at all don't just
[3:25:39.240 --> 3:25:45.640]  declassify all the decriminating documents but explain precisely to the american people
[3:25:45.640 --> 3:25:51.560]  while you are doing it at the same time what's interesting to me is how quickly the news narrative
[3:25:51.560 --> 3:25:58.520]  can change last week it was all paul manifold michael cone and oh yes roger stone is next
[3:25:58.520 --> 3:26:04.280]  despite the fact that they still have no evidence of russian collusion or wiki leaks collaboration
[3:26:04.280 --> 3:26:11.160]  or any other crime on my part but this week you know it's quite different sorry to interrupt
[3:26:11.160 --> 3:26:18.200]  roger do you think the president has a realistic sense of the degree to which these midterm elections
[3:26:18.200 --> 3:26:23.240]  are already being stolen i mean we've seen paul joseph watson had an article today
[3:26:23.240 --> 3:26:28.440]  on info wars talking about this it's massive election fraud it's being done right now every
[3:26:28.440 --> 3:26:34.280]  day with the censorship does the president have any real idea of what's going on it's it's election
[3:26:34.280 --> 3:26:41.640]  meddling gone awry well i think there's a massive game of keep away going on around the president
[3:26:41.640 --> 3:26:47.880]  therefore it's difficult for us to know exactly uh what he knows although the indications on his
[3:26:47.880 --> 3:26:55.160]  twitter feed are quite positive mike i mean i think he is getting it again it took a search of
[3:26:55.160 --> 3:27:01.400]  himself on google for him to figure out what's going on at google which is the flagship of the
[3:27:01.400 --> 3:27:08.840]  censorship operation but quick reversal here a new focus on bruce war and his activities in
[3:27:08.840 --> 3:27:15.240]  the justice department a new focus on the fact that the chinese hacked hillary clinton's emails
[3:27:15.240 --> 3:27:22.440]  a new fact focus on the fact that her missing emails definitely included classified information
[3:27:22.440 --> 3:27:28.920]  and then and this one really tickles me carl burnstein of cnn formerly of the washington post
[3:27:28.920 --> 3:27:37.400]  one part of the woodward and burnstein duo exposed as a bald faced liar he goes on the air and says
[3:27:37.400 --> 3:27:43.480]  and says uh well the president michael cone will tell robert moeller or anyone else who asks
[3:27:43.480 --> 3:27:49.400]  that donald trump knew about the trump tower meeting between donald trump jr and a russian
[3:27:49.400 --> 3:27:55.080]  lawyer now we know that that's completely false that's the same thing brian ross got fired for
[3:27:55.080 --> 3:27:59.880]  at abc saying that they admitted they were russian agents these people are lying sacks of garbage
[3:28:00.600 --> 3:28:06.280]  so the only thing that's extraordinary is the level of gas lighting takes place and we got two
[3:28:06.280 --> 3:28:10.600]  guys on skype it's while they're walking on each other go ahead mike adams well i'm just saying
[3:28:10.600 --> 3:28:16.520]  the level of gas lighting cnn denying uh that they need to even retract that story carl burnstein
[3:28:16.520 --> 3:28:21.080]  they're protecting his reputation because they have to protect his entire history i'm starting
[3:28:21.080 --> 3:28:25.960]  to suspect that some of his reporting on watergate may have been fake news decades ago as well if he's
[3:28:25.960 --> 3:28:29.720]  faking it now he could have faked it back then that's why they're they're circling the wagons to
[3:28:29.720 --> 3:28:35.000]  protect him now even though everybody else knows cnn lied and carl burnstein lied all right roger
[3:28:35.000 --> 3:28:39.080]  get that toots better we'll talk to you tomorrow mike adams two powerful segments natural news

[3:33:45.560 --> 3:33:51.000]  with roger stone joining me for one more segment now right before the break i made almost a flip
[3:33:51.000 --> 3:33:57.720]  and comment about carl bernstein and questioning his journalistic credibility because of the lies
[3:33:57.720 --> 3:34:03.400]  that have now been exposed in his byline of a cnn piece that has turned out to be completely
[3:34:04.040 --> 3:34:09.000]  fabricated at least one of the sources was was fabricated there lies about the sources in that
[3:34:09.000 --> 3:34:14.680]  piece roger stone of course has a tremendous amount of knowledge about watergate and carl
[3:34:14.680 --> 3:34:19.400]  bernstein himself so roger go ahead and give us the real story on on that whole situation and
[3:34:19.400 --> 3:34:25.000]  why this is relevant today that bernstein is caught in another lie well mike i'm like an old
[3:34:25.000 --> 3:34:30.600]  warhorse who smells paint uh who smells smoke and therefore i got to jump back into the fray but
[3:34:30.600 --> 3:34:37.000]  you asked the 64 million dollar question the only question now is who's a bigger liar woodward
[3:34:37.000 --> 3:34:44.600]  or bernstein here's the point bob woodward lied about his role in the military lied about being a
[3:34:44.600 --> 3:34:51.800]  military briefer for general alexander haig the white house chief of staff and thus lied about
[3:34:51.800 --> 3:34:58.040]  his knowledge of the watergate scandal carl bernstein just got busted for lying about the
[3:34:58.040 --> 3:35:05.240]  fact that lanie davis was his source for a cnn story which claimed that president trump
[3:35:05.240 --> 3:35:11.800]  knew in advance about the trump tower meeting between his son donald trump jr and a russian
[3:35:11.800 --> 3:35:19.640]  plant who it turns out to have worked for fusion gps so both woodward and bernstein are now exposed
[3:35:19.640 --> 3:35:28.040]  not as the greatest two journalists of the age but as two bs artists busted i am working feverishly
[3:35:28.040 --> 3:35:35.560]  with tyler nixon a nixon family relative on a new monograph that exposes the woodward and
[3:35:35.560 --> 3:35:42.920]  bernstein lies but there is no question that cnn is busted carl bernstein is busted and as bright
[3:35:42.920 --> 3:35:49.480]  bart said there was a staff uprising at cnn if bernstein wasn't such a big foot he would have been
[3:35:49.480 --> 3:35:55.720]  fired and the piece formally retracted but wait cnn says there's no censorship of conservatives
[3:35:55.720 --> 3:36:03.720]  they also said the sky is red yeah cnn and roger is fake the big difference the big difference
[3:36:03.720 --> 3:36:08.520]  between the watergate era and now is that back in the watergate era the liberal media had absolute
[3:36:08.520 --> 3:36:12.840]  control over the narrative there there was no info wars there was no bright bart no one was able
[3:36:12.840 --> 3:36:18.280]  to question the narrative so they got away with everything but today people can question it in
[3:36:18.280 --> 3:36:23.640]  fact you know glenn greenwald is questioning cnn over this and he's not he's not a trump supporter
[3:36:23.640 --> 3:36:28.520]  by any means but isn't isn't cnn committing credibility suicide right now with this and even
[3:36:28.520 --> 3:36:34.440]  carl bernstein himself isn't he going down with his own the ship of his own making in in this case
[3:36:35.240 --> 3:36:39.160]  now i think you've hit it right on the head which is precisely why they want to get the
[3:36:39.160 --> 3:36:45.400]  toothpaste back in the tomb they recognize that the evolution of a robust vibrant alternative
[3:36:45.400 --> 3:36:53.240]  media with info wars as the flagship has led to a great awakening it led to the the viability of
[3:36:53.240 --> 3:36:59.160]  Donald Trump's candidacy and the possibility of his election which is why they want to censor
[3:36:59.160 --> 3:37:07.160]  alex jones why they want to shut down info wars and if we are first the daily caller bright bart
[3:37:07.160 --> 3:37:14.680]  mike savage rush limbaugh tucker carlson shon hanity all the people i like they are next
[3:37:14.680 --> 3:37:21.080]  that's why we are in the epic struggle of all time we're living in a torrent of fake news here
[3:37:21.080 --> 3:37:26.280]  mike i want to break some of this down for you uh in just the last week in just the last week
[3:37:27.000 --> 3:37:35.240]  i was contacted by uh ronan farrow of the new yorker he is was carrying a fake news story that
[3:37:35.240 --> 3:37:40.760]  i already batted down at the new york times and at the washington post it goes like this
[3:37:40.760 --> 3:37:47.960]  on october 1st i called donald trump and told him what was in the coming wiki leaks disclosures
[3:37:47.960 --> 3:37:54.600]  and when they would come out completely and totally false allegedly the source knows this
[3:37:54.600 --> 3:38:01.160]  because trump put me on a speakerphone and he overheard the conversation let's be clear never
[3:38:01.160 --> 3:38:08.280]  happened you cannot tell somebody something you don't know then but now the media roger there the
[3:38:08.280 --> 3:38:13.240]  mode of the media is they don't care what the facts are they don't care who substantiates something
[3:38:13.240 --> 3:38:19.720]  even when in this story when cnn is contradicted by their primary source for their article they
[3:38:19.720 --> 3:38:26.200]  still somehow stand behind their article as if reality doesn't matter anymore it's as if they
[3:38:26.200 --> 3:38:31.080]  just fabricate they just weave fictions and then they expect everybody to swallow it and if you
[3:38:31.080 --> 3:38:37.000]  question them then you're called uh unpatured unpatriotic or an enemy of the first amendment
[3:38:37.000 --> 3:38:46.040]  it's it's insane a white supremacist look and then phase two uh ryan lisa uh formally of the
[3:38:46.040 --> 3:38:53.960]  new yorker comes forward and says uh well michael cone has a tape of he and i discussing the wiki
[3:38:53.960 --> 3:39:00.920]  leaks disclosures that was made in october of 2016 bad news for you ryan i didn't speak to michael
[3:39:00.920 --> 3:39:09.400]  cone at all in the fall of 2016 nevermind october there is no such tape again a torrent of fake
[3:39:09.400 --> 3:39:15.320]  news designed to destroy me uh that's just why i got out in front of it there's a piece on cnn
[3:39:15.320 --> 3:39:21.960]  last night i denied both these things but more importantly come forward with the proof if someone
[3:39:21.960 --> 3:39:26.600]  isn't honestly saying this let's somehow put their name on it who is the person telling the new york
[3:39:26.600 --> 3:39:32.600]  times the washington post the new yorker put your name on it oh you don't have a source it's anonymous
[3:39:32.600 --> 3:39:37.560]  uh who who says that there is a tape of me and michael cone is it michael cone is it
[3:39:37.560 --> 3:39:44.840]  lady davis play the tape let's hear the tape the tape doesn't exist it is a cornucopia of
[3:39:44.840 --> 3:39:51.720]  fake news it is a smear we've seen these kind of smears on alex jones just in the last couple days
[3:39:51.720 --> 3:39:57.160]  they recognize that we are breaking through donald trump is having his great awakening
[3:39:57.160 --> 3:40:03.480]  there's a whole chain of establishment politicians who are about to get tanned and i think they've
[3:40:03.480 --> 3:40:09.240]  figured it out mike i think i appreciate coming back on with you and now i'm going to put my
[3:40:09.240 --> 3:40:15.000]  feet up and pop another percassette because my jaw is killing me but i appreciate you jumping
[3:40:15.000 --> 3:40:22.120]  roger much appreciate you joining the broadcast for the you know get some rest be well you know
[3:40:22.120 --> 3:40:26.760]  you're under a lot of stress and it's extraordinary remember that alan dirshowitz said recently that
[3:40:26.760 --> 3:40:32.600]  the greatest crime now that someone can commit in america is simply having been associated
[3:40:32.600 --> 3:40:38.600]  with donald trump even before he was president and that's why roger stone is being scrutinized
[3:40:38.600 --> 3:40:45.800]  up threatened harassed defamed lied about at every level we're dealing with a vicious malicious
[3:40:46.440 --> 3:40:51.880]  media now i mean they're you can't even call the media they are democrat activists they're
[3:40:51.880 --> 3:40:57.560]  they're trying to carry out a coup attempt against the president that coup has so far failed but they
[3:40:57.560 --> 3:41:02.680]  don't represent the first amendment they don't represent freedom of the media in any way whatsoever
[3:41:02.680 --> 3:41:09.080]  they are abusing those privileges and trying to destroy this country from within they're sowing
[3:41:09.080 --> 3:41:14.120]  poison in the minds of the american people and they're attacking innocent people like our guest
[3:41:14.120 --> 3:41:21.800]  today roger stone so again thank you for joining us roger just be well okay i appreciate your kind
[3:41:21.800 --> 3:41:27.560]  wishes and i want to remind all of our listeners you can go to stonedefensefund.com that stone

[3:41:52.840 --> 3:41:57.320]  more segments here on the alex jones show i've got some very fascinating areas to cover here
[3:41:57.320 --> 3:42:02.840]  including a deep dive into the motivations behind the establishment why are they so
[3:42:02.840 --> 3:42:09.080]  desperately trying to destroy voices of reason and voices of liberty and voices that support our
[3:42:09.080 --> 3:42:15.400]  president it's about much more than just the presidency itself it's about much more than
[3:42:15.400 --> 3:42:19.000]  trying to steal the 2018 elections even though that's part of it it's about more than even
[3:42:19.000 --> 3:42:24.120]  trying to take back the white house in 2020 there is a deeper reason behind all of this and that's
[3:42:24.120 --> 3:42:30.760]  why they are so freaked out and so desperate about this epic uprising among the people right now who
[3:42:30.760 --> 3:42:37.080]  are saying enough censorship enough of us being lied to by the media enough of us being controlled
[3:42:37.080 --> 3:42:43.080]  and dictated to by a corrupt regime we're going to take back this country for real people and
[3:42:43.080 --> 3:42:47.880]  real liberty all of that straight ahead as we continue on the alex jones show don't go anywhere

[3:47:20.440 --> 3:47:27.000]  jones show this is mike adams filling in thank you for joining us i've got a very powerful segment
[3:47:27.000 --> 3:47:32.680]  for you here i'm going to get right to it in a second but i also want to plug that this sunday
[3:47:32.680 --> 3:47:38.440]  at six p.m central on info wars dot com i've got a full show called counterthink that's going to
[3:47:38.440 --> 3:47:44.520]  dive into more details of what i'll be teasing here over the next few minutes we're talking about
[3:47:46.440 --> 3:47:53.160]  exposing the false authority of centralized power we're talking about the war on humanity
[3:47:53.160 --> 3:48:02.440]  the war on fertility the war on normal reproduction and also how the 5g network is the extermination
[3:48:02.440 --> 3:48:08.840]  network to destroy humanity by causing mass cancer alzheimer's and other diseases we're
[3:48:08.840 --> 3:48:17.240]  going to do a very detailed dive on 5g and that is this sunday the counterthink show on info wars
[3:48:17.240 --> 3:48:23.960]  dot com at six p.m it's also broadcast on radio and tv affiliates across this nation but check
[3:48:23.960 --> 3:48:28.280]  info wars dot com for the show this sunday i'm going to be going into that it's it's really
[3:48:28.280 --> 3:48:33.240]  extraordinary i've done a lot of research on this topic and i've discovered some bombshell
[3:48:33.240 --> 3:48:40.360]  horrifying things about 5g technology the phase array antennas that they're using and how they
[3:48:40.360 --> 3:48:48.600]  can be weaponized using software to literally target specific individuals in society with
[3:48:49.560 --> 3:48:55.240]  almost what you would call like death ray beams i'm i'm not even making it up it sounds it sounds
[3:48:55.240 --> 3:49:01.080]  crazy but if you if you study the technology and you look at how it works it can be abused as a
[3:49:01.080 --> 3:49:06.200]  weapon system to target individuals so all of that is coming up this sunday at info wars dot com
[3:49:06.200 --> 3:49:15.080]  at six p.m now right now just to to give you my take on turmeric the info wars store has bodies
[3:49:15.080 --> 3:49:23.480]  back in stock the limited supply is 50 off while that supply lasts and it is based on turmeric
[3:49:23.480 --> 3:49:29.960]  curcumin curcumin is the active constituent in turmeric as well as piperine which is an
[3:49:29.960 --> 3:49:36.120]  extract from black pepper and of course the fda restricts just from from saying much about this but
[3:49:36.120 --> 3:49:41.160]  i can tell you if you research the combination of black pepper extract and turmeric you will find
[3:49:41.160 --> 3:49:46.200]  there is something extraordinary about that combination that does things for your body
[3:49:46.200 --> 3:49:52.920]  that no other known combination of herbs or spices can dare accomplish so if you're looking for
[3:49:52.920 --> 3:49:58.600]  maximal joint support mobility support these kinds of issues definitely check that out info
[3:49:58.600 --> 3:50:05.400]  wars store dot com bodies is 50 off back in stock for limited time only also just as a side note
[3:50:06.280 --> 3:50:12.200]  because you know i have my own e-commerce and manufacturing and all that we source raw ingredients
[3:50:12.200 --> 3:50:19.400]  as well and we have a tremendous amount of trouble now finding clean turmeric if you wonder why like
[3:50:19.400 --> 3:50:24.840]  why does bodies go in and out of stock at the info wars store we have the same problem we can't
[3:50:24.840 --> 3:50:30.680]  keep it in stock because the clean stuff is so hard to find and it's so rare that when we get it in
[3:50:30.680 --> 3:50:35.800]  it sells out in like a week and then the only thing that we can find in the marketplace is this
[3:50:36.440 --> 3:50:42.120]  heavy metals contaminated raw material from china or india often india and you know we run heavy
[3:50:42.120 --> 3:50:48.040]  metals tests as as does info wars and we we have to reject like 80 of the lots that we come across
[3:50:48.040 --> 3:50:55.240]  and that's why we cannot keep clean food in stock and people just buy it so quickly when it's when
[3:50:55.240 --> 3:51:00.120]  it's and right now it's on sale so that's a pretty big deal at info wars store dot com
[3:51:00.920 --> 3:51:06.360]  all right getting into now the the deep dive into the reasons the motivations behind this
[3:51:06.360 --> 3:51:11.080]  censorship as i mentioned before the break this is about much more than just trying to steal the
[3:51:11.080 --> 3:51:15.320]  election even though that's a huge deal and that's massive fraud and that's that's a criminal act
[3:51:15.320 --> 3:51:21.480]  being carried out by these tech giants there's more to it now listen carefully on this because this
[3:51:21.480 --> 3:51:26.840]  when this realization hit me it was such a big deal i i had to just step back and think about this
[3:51:26.840 --> 3:51:38.120]  for a second humanity is on the verge of breaking out into a massive wave of freedom of independence
[3:51:38.120 --> 3:51:46.840]  of of self governance humanity has come to learn that we can cast aside the false central
[3:51:46.840 --> 3:51:53.000]  authorities that claim to dominate our lives and try to enslave us at every level and through
[3:51:53.000 --> 3:51:59.320]  every sector of society for example right now we are coming to realize we the people
[3:51:59.320 --> 3:52:05.720]  that we don't need centralized news we don't need the new york times we don't need cnn in fact cnn
[3:52:05.720 --> 3:52:12.200]  is a danger to a civil society cnn is a net negative to society because of spreading false
[3:52:12.200 --> 3:52:19.320]  information lies tearing apart the culture of pushing strife you know a defending violent
[3:52:19.320 --> 3:52:24.840]  groups like antifa now it's incredible we don't need centralized sources of information we're
[3:52:24.840 --> 3:52:30.040]  also coming to realize all of us we the people that we actually don't need a centralized federal
[3:52:30.040 --> 3:52:36.440]  government if you think about it the fact that trump is in there right now is great he is draining
[3:52:36.440 --> 3:52:42.280]  the swamp in every way he can but when he's out of there which will happen one day and somebody
[3:52:42.280 --> 3:52:48.440]  else comes in probably a swamp creature you're going to realize yet again how dangerous a centralized
[3:52:48.440 --> 3:52:54.760]  federal authority is to your freedoms and liberties and it is none other than john w whitehead
[3:52:54.760 --> 3:53:01.560]  who i believe wrote the book battlefield america who has been on this point every day for years
[3:53:01.560 --> 3:53:07.880]  accurately describing the threat to our freedom by an ever expanding government that has weaponized
[3:53:07.880 --> 3:53:13.320]  every agency and every regulatory body the epa has been weaponized against farmers the fda is
[3:53:13.320 --> 3:53:17.960]  weaponized against the natural supplements industry the irs under obama was weaponized
[3:53:17.960 --> 3:53:23.880]  against patriot nonprofit groups the epa think about it it's the environmental pollution agency
[3:53:23.880 --> 3:53:28.840]  they push pollution and they they approve of polluting pesticides and herbicides used in
[3:53:28.840 --> 3:53:37.240]  chemical agriculture the dea you know still trying to criminalize which is in my view a
[3:53:37.240 --> 3:53:42.920]  tremendously valuable natural substance that can be used as a natural medicine and can be
[3:53:42.920 --> 3:53:48.920]  created for very low costs all across the country these federal agencies have way too much power
[3:53:48.920 --> 3:53:54.440]  and we the people have come to realize that we don't need them ruling over us in our lives
[3:53:54.440 --> 3:53:59.800]  and in the same way we don't need frankly a centralized currency we don't need a federal
[3:53:59.800 --> 3:54:06.440]  reserve we we understand the value of decentralized currencies especially cryptocurrency in all its
[3:54:06.440 --> 3:54:12.600]  various forms we understand the value of decentralizing education because government
[3:54:12.600 --> 3:54:17.320]  run schools are just indoctrination centers pushing brainwashing and lies instead of teaching
[3:54:17.320 --> 3:54:23.240]  children the real truth or even the real history even history itself has now been concentrated in
[3:54:23.240 --> 3:54:29.720]  the hands of the corrupt elite in washington dc and in state governments history is twisted and
[3:54:29.720 --> 3:54:35.800]  warped in order to poison the minds of the masses and to make the population hate their own country
[3:54:36.440 --> 3:54:41.480]  think about it these kids in school today they hate america they hate the free market system
[3:54:41.480 --> 3:54:45.800]  they're begging for socialism and communism and they've never lived under it they have no idea
[3:54:45.800 --> 3:54:52.600]  the degree of human suffering the secret prisons the gulags the government torture the government
[3:54:52.600 --> 3:54:58.440]  disappearing of dissidents they have no idea what they're begging for because the education system
[3:54:58.440 --> 3:55:06.120]  poisoned them the answer to all of this is the mass decentralization of every institution
[3:55:06.120 --> 3:55:12.760]  in our world we need to decentralize medicine technology education we need to decentralize
[3:55:12.760 --> 3:55:16.680]  the internet and the tech giants we need to decentralize government we need to have local
[3:55:16.680 --> 3:55:22.280]  control over our lives and our destinies we need to have local people making decisions because
[3:55:22.280 --> 3:55:26.120]  they are the ones who are best qualified to make decisions about what's happening right
[3:55:26.120 --> 3:55:32.920]  there in your neighborhood in your community in your state a federal system is no longer
[3:55:32.920 --> 3:55:39.480]  compatible with the awakening of humanity that is taking place right now and that is why
[3:55:39.480 --> 3:55:45.320]  this censorship fight is so vicious it's not just about trump it's not just about the 2018 elections
[3:55:45.320 --> 3:55:52.520]  it's about them trying to preserve the very fabric of their twisted dominance their false
[3:55:52.520 --> 3:55:58.520]  authority over the masses that's what they are fighting for that's why they are so desperate
[3:55:58.520 --> 3:56:02.840]  why do they go to these great lengths to censor alex jones and take info wars offline and take
[3:56:02.840 --> 3:56:08.920]  me offline you know i was de-platformed even before info wars was on youtube why are they
[3:56:08.920 --> 3:56:13.240]  going to these great lengths why are they banning everybody you know from an colter and and attacking
[3:56:13.240 --> 3:56:22.120]  shawna hannity and all these people it's because they are fighting to maintain control over their
[3:56:22.120 --> 3:56:28.840]  centralized authorities and this false paradigm they brainwashed humanity to believe but humanity
[3:56:28.840 --> 3:56:34.840]  doesn't need that humanity is waking up humanity is casting off the shackles we are about to break
[3:56:34.840 --> 3:56:42.040]  free from this mental enslavement that has affected us all for generations it has been this way for
[3:56:42.040 --> 3:56:47.080]  such a long period of time that some people have forgotten what it's like to live as free men and
[3:56:47.080 --> 3:56:52.360]  women in a free society but that awakening is happening now thanks to the support of people
