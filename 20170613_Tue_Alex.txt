[00:00.000 --> 00:13.880]  You've found it the tip of the spear it is the Alex Jones show with
[00:13.880 --> 00:23.520]  Owen Troyer welcome into the Alex Jones show live for you this June 13 2017 the
[00:23.520 --> 00:30.880]  thought criminal Alex Jones how dare Megan Kelly interview Alex Jones the
[00:30.880 --> 00:35.720]  thought criminal it's not like the mainstream media reported on weapons of
[00:35.720 --> 00:39.440]  mass destruction that didn't exist that we went to war over it's not like
[00:39.440 --> 00:44.440]  Charles Jacob from CNN was pretending to broadcast from Saudi Arabia when he was
[00:44.440 --> 00:51.180]  in a CNN studio in Atlanta no it's not like women crying over babies and
[00:51.180 --> 00:55.400]  incubators a fake news story it's not like the entire mainstream media falling
[00:55.400 --> 00:59.840]  for the Aleppo boy which it's now come out his father has told the story how
[00:59.840 --> 01:03.960]  basically the white hats came and took them and took them for pictures and his
[01:03.960 --> 01:08.120]  father actually supports the Assad regime no it's not like the media reporting
[01:08.120 --> 01:11.440]  on that it's not like Barack Obama telling you you can keep your doctor you
[01:11.440 --> 01:14.960]  can keep your health care plan Jonathan Gruber calling the American public a
[01:14.960 --> 01:19.360]  bunch of idiots it's not like that it's not like the Gulf of Tonkin a made-up
[01:19.360 --> 01:23.880]  story to send us to war it's not like the 28 secret pages of the 9-11
[01:23.880 --> 01:29.160]  investigation that doesn't exist it wasn't Alex Jones the thought criminal
[01:29.160 --> 01:37.760]  that told you those lies was it no it was the mainstream media so now Alex
[01:37.760 --> 01:43.640]  Jones is demonized because he has original thought he doesn't go with the
[01:43.640 --> 01:47.760]  official story and he goes with his gut and with his own historical research and
[01:47.760 --> 01:55.080]  analysis so now there is backlash for Megyn Kelly interviewing him I'm sure
[01:55.080 --> 01:59.400]  you've heard about all of this and the craziest part about this is to me which
[01:59.400 --> 02:04.080]  really shows you the nature of who's actually impacting America they want
[02:04.080 --> 02:07.760]  to say that the Russians hacked the election the Russians hacked here we've
[02:07.760 --> 02:12.800]  got new stories today 38 new accounts where the Russians have 40 new accounts
[02:12.800 --> 02:18.280]  all these new things the Russians the Russian the Russians meanwhile so we're
[02:18.280 --> 02:23.120]  led to believe that the Russians are acting in hostility against this nation
[02:23.120 --> 02:28.920]  led by Vladimir Putin meanwhile Megan Kelly interviews Vladimir Putin nobody
[02:28.920 --> 02:37.600]  even cares nobody even knows nobody even notices that Vladimir Putin gets
[02:37.600 --> 02:41.520]  interviewed by Megan Kelly this guy who's running all the elections he's
[02:41.520 --> 02:44.760]  affecting the elections in the United States he's affecting affecting
[02:44.760 --> 02:48.320]  elections in Europe he's affecting all these elections not George Soros it's
[02:48.320 --> 02:52.160]  Vladimir Putin then Megan Kelly interviews Vladimir Putin doesn't even
[02:52.160 --> 02:56.160]  get a blip on the radar screen what does that tell you about where what
[02:56.160 --> 02:59.760]  Americans think about this Russian scandal that doesn't exist but then
[02:59.760 --> 03:04.720]  Megan Kelly dares to interview the thought criminal Alex Jones and you've
[03:04.720 --> 03:10.920]  got all the stories now condemning Megan Kelly as an advertiser I'm repulsed
[03:10.920 --> 03:15.360]  JP Morgan Chase marketing boss polls for polls ads from Megan Kelly show in
[03:15.360 --> 03:23.000]  wake of uproar over upcoming Alex Jones the uproar there's an uproar dangerous
[03:23.000 --> 03:28.120]  hateful goon Twitter unloads on NBC for upcoming Alex Jones Megan Kelly interview
[03:28.120 --> 03:36.080]  it wasn't even an interview she came here to stage a hit piece so here's all
[03:36.080 --> 03:39.560]  of these people are freaking out that Megan Kelly would even dare sit down
[03:39.560 --> 03:43.360]  with Alex Jones meanwhile they're in the process of putting together the
[03:43.360 --> 03:48.760]  ultimate hit piece on him they should be glad that Megan Kelly came here to do a
[03:48.760 --> 03:52.720]  hit piece on Alex Jones they should be glad that Megan Kelly came here for an
[03:52.720 --> 03:56.840]  entire day for an 11-minute segment featuring the thought criminal Alex
[03:56.840 --> 04:06.880]  Jones but no no how dare how dare Megan Kelly I'll pull my ads no no no don't
[04:06.880 --> 04:11.240]  worry about the New York Public Theater that's depicting the assassination of
[04:11.240 --> 04:14.600]  Donald Trump that now has people pulling ads and then American Express
[04:14.600 --> 04:18.040]  allegedly is not pulling their advertisements that was something I
[04:18.040 --> 04:22.240]  thought was gonna happen didn't happen it gets a standing ovation oh you
[04:22.240 --> 04:25.000]  depicted the assassination of the president
[04:25.000 --> 04:29.200]  meanwhile Russia is hacking everything nobody cares that making Kelly
[04:29.200 --> 04:33.440]  interviews Vladimir Putin and the mainstream media interviews former
[04:33.440 --> 04:40.640]  Obama Democrat campaign directors and they act like they're just random people
[04:40.640 --> 04:45.120]  on the streets they've done this before they do it again fake news MSNBC
[04:45.120 --> 04:49.720]  pretends Obama campaign director is random woman on the street they rig
[04:49.720 --> 04:53.120]  everything in the fake news that's why they hate Alex Jones because he's real
[04:53.120 --> 04:56.840]  we'll hear from Alex Jones on the other side he'll be back live in this seat in
[04:56.840 --> 04:59.360]  just about an hour
[04:59.360 --> 05:05.320]  the collapse of the left continues if it isn't Maxine Waters or Nancy Pelosi
[05:05.320 --> 05:09.120]  having a mental breakdown if it isn't Snoop Doggity dog pretending to shoot
[05:09.120 --> 05:12.880]  President Trump if it isn't Kathy Griffin going full Isis and depicting
[05:12.880 --> 05:17.040]  herself with a decapitated trumpet it's the New York Public Theater depicting
[05:17.040 --> 05:20.800]  the assassination of President Trump in their latest installment of Shakespeare
[05:20.800 --> 05:24.720]  in the park the play depicted President Trump as the modern-day Julius Caesar
[05:24.720 --> 05:28.960]  this time being stabbed to death by minorities and women a clear subliminal
[05:28.960 --> 05:34.280]  message leave it to CNN to endorse such an atrocity as Farid Zakaria said the
[05:34.280 --> 05:38.240]  play is a masterpiece but the disturbing presentation did not go without
[05:38.240 --> 05:41.760]  consequences as major sponsors of the theater have now pulled their
[05:41.760 --> 05:46.040]  sponsorship dollars such as Delta Airlines and Bank of America who have
[05:46.040 --> 05:50.760]  supported the theater to the tunes of millions in the past the suicide of the

[08:41.280 --> 08:49.320]  ladies and gentlemen in the last 24 hours according to Twitter according to
[08:49.320 --> 08:54.360]  Google according to Facebook the number one trending story in the United States
[08:54.360 --> 08:59.240]  one of the top stories in the world has been Megan Kelly Alex Jones those two
[08:59.240 --> 09:05.160]  names together now you would think that having this huge firestorm controversy
[09:05.160 --> 09:10.880]  taking place MSM would actually interview me or would actually go to the
[09:10.880 --> 09:16.040]  live feeds and videos that I put out concerning the controversy but they
[09:16.040 --> 09:21.480]  won't do it only a handful us say today New York Daily News and others have
[09:21.480 --> 09:26.840]  actually run with this fact that I have said to end this controversy that I
[09:26.840 --> 09:31.760]  think the Megan Kelly interview coming up on Father's Day this Sunday that she
[09:31.760 --> 09:37.240]  did with me last week here in Austin should be shelved now the reason I say
[09:37.240 --> 09:45.640]  that is Megan Kelly misrepresented my views and where I stand on Sandy Hook in
[09:45.640 --> 09:49.480]  the edit for the promo piece she put out and I'm sick and tired of it and I'll
[09:49.480 --> 09:53.280]  break more of that down in a few minutes but notice the big secret here is
[09:53.280 --> 09:58.040]  hidden in plain view I put out a video a year ago saying I believe Sandy Hook
[09:58.040 --> 10:02.320]  happened I put out a video two years ago saying I believed it leaned towards the
[10:02.320 --> 10:06.360]  official story being at least partially true though they had some PR firms there
[10:06.360 --> 10:10.760]  and we're trying to exacerbate and use the crisis as Rahm Emanuel said don't
[10:10.760 --> 10:15.720]  let a good crisis go to waste and they will never actually quote what I said
[10:15.720 --> 10:19.640]  they will take a devil's advocate statement I made out of context Hillary
[10:19.640 --> 10:26.760]  Clinton ran ads and the campaign featuring me very manipulated and edited
[10:26.760 --> 10:33.560]  it's ongoing so imagine this I have come out and said again in a video
[10:33.560 --> 10:38.120]  yesterday and the day before two different new videos that I believe Sandy
[10:38.120 --> 10:43.520]  Hook happened and they will not run it anywhere but three publications when
[10:43.520 --> 10:49.580]  there are thousands and thousands and thousands number one story now think
[10:49.580 --> 10:53.880]  about that that is the deception what are they doing here they want to
[10:53.880 --> 10:57.980]  demonize new media alternative media by misrepresenting what we say and do they
[10:57.980 --> 11:01.400]  want to come in and start censoring new media and the internet and they're
[11:01.400 --> 11:05.840]  using info wars.com as the poster child for it and they're able to do it to us
[11:05.840 --> 11:10.840]  they can do it to you now some will say then well then why are you saying pull
[11:10.840 --> 11:16.040]  the interview if they're trying to misrepresent you and MSM to to restrict
[11:16.040 --> 11:20.040]  your speech it's because Megan is playing along with it she's in with the
[11:20.040 --> 11:24.280]  Sandy Hook groups she speaks at their events this is all a big PR event
[11:24.280 --> 11:28.640]  having them protest her then gives it more hype and then puts it out there
[11:28.640 --> 11:32.520]  like I'm the ultimate demon on the earth imagine this a week and a half ago she
[11:32.520 --> 11:38.200]  interviews Putin supposedly the evil mass murdering criminal they claim but
[11:38.200 --> 11:43.240]  it's okay for her to talk to Putin only Alex Jones is so bad only Alex Jones is
[11:43.240 --> 11:48.560]  so evil that we can't see his interview and on top of that we can't hear what
[11:48.560 --> 11:53.120]  he actually has to say so the reason I'm saying sure don't air the interview is
[11:53.120 --> 11:57.320]  because it's going to be edited to misrepresent what I said in the promo
[11:57.320 --> 12:02.560]  piece she makes it sound like I'm saying Sandy Hook didn't happen when I
[12:02.560 --> 12:06.400]  explained to her both sides of it and I explained that I only had debates and
[12:06.400 --> 12:11.560]  looked at the full story it's incredible and so I'm tired of being
[12:11.560 --> 12:16.200]  misrepresented and despite the fact I came out yesterday and said pull the
[12:16.200 --> 12:21.840]  interview almost no coverage of that even though it's sensational when this is
[12:21.840 --> 12:25.680]  the top story in the country to have the person being interviewed to say yes go
[12:25.680 --> 12:29.560]  ahead and pull it and almost no coverage that's because they want the
[12:29.560 --> 12:38.760]  straw man the edited straw man of Alex Jones the doppelganger the imposter they
[12:38.760 --> 12:43.600]  want to use that and hold that up and then misrepresent what I've said or
[12:43.600 --> 12:47.920]  what I've done when I talk about the 28 pages and our government ordering a
[12:47.920 --> 12:52.080]  stand down for Saudi Arabia that's now been declassified and the 28 pages they
[12:52.080 --> 12:56.560]  say that I say the firefighters blew up the World Trade Centers firefighters were
[12:56.560 --> 13:00.440]  heroes so were the police they were some of our witnesses to the bombs that were
[13:00.440 --> 13:05.320]  in the buildings again that's how they misrepresent I point out that in the
[13:05.320 --> 13:13.040]  Iraq war they staged events and lied us into that conflict claiming that babies
[13:13.040 --> 13:16.480]  were being thrown out of incubators that babies were being killed and all the
[13:16.480 --> 13:23.560]  rest of this garbage and that we can't just sit here and trust an MSM that has
[13:23.560 --> 13:29.040]  shown itself to be such incredible liars why is this happening this is
[13:29.040 --> 13:35.000]  happening because dinosaur media the term I coined is in crisis is falling
[13:35.000 --> 13:39.400]  apart the dwindling waterholes they have of corporate money are evaporating and
[13:39.400 --> 13:44.800]  new media that questions their lives in real time is popping up everywhere just
[13:44.800 --> 13:51.120]  today on info wars.com there are tons of links to mainstream media being caught
[13:51.120 --> 13:55.920]  interviewing actors interviewing political consultants and claiming that
[13:55.920 --> 13:59.440]  they were just people on the street there's new articles coming out with a
[13:59.440 --> 14:03.800]  little boy that was bombed in Syria supposedly by the Russians and his family
[14:03.800 --> 14:08.120]  coming out saying it was actually ISIS that bombed them I mean everything they
[14:08.120 --> 14:13.040]  say is being reversed everything they promote is being disproven so what do
[14:13.040 --> 14:16.480]  they do when they're the fake media they go and they pick somebody who's
[14:16.480 --> 14:20.720]  prominent like myself who supports Americana who supports the restoration of
[14:20.720 --> 14:25.680]  our Republic who supports President Trump to try to destroy his base they try
[14:25.680 --> 14:30.520]  to destroy me and they try to also intimidate all of you that if you ever
[14:30.520 --> 14:36.360]  question official narratives you will be destroyed but I want to be clear before
[14:36.360 --> 14:41.960]  I go over these articles Megan Kelly told me I'm not gonna get into Sandy Hook or
[14:41.960 --> 14:44.800]  any of this other stuff you know I might just mention it and just let you
[14:44.800 --> 14:48.480]  clarify and then she interrogated me asked me five or six times on each
[14:48.480 --> 14:53.200]  subject never stopped and then edited the promo piece together deceptively and
[14:53.200 --> 14:58.160]  that's why I'm saying don't air it because I don't want to be used in
[14:58.160 --> 15:03.560]  another deception to drive wedges in this country and again undoubtedly for
[15:03.560 --> 15:08.280]  years this whole Sandy Hook PR deal with Bloomberg and Big Money and MSM not
[15:08.280 --> 15:13.880]  the families but Big Money and MSM clearly is synthetic is fake and is
[15:13.880 --> 15:17.960]  pushing this like it's war propaganda or something against myself and the
[15:17.960 --> 15:21.480]  independent media just hammering and hammering and hammering and hammering
[15:21.480 --> 15:28.480]  where I stand and what I believe it is the fact that MSM is so untrusted that
[15:28.480 --> 15:34.320]  the public didn't buy Sandy Hook and there were anomalies and we'll go over
[15:34.320 --> 15:37.480]  some of those and we're allowed to ask questions and we're allowed to
[15:37.480 --> 15:41.920]  investigate because that's what a free society is based on and governments are
[15:41.920 --> 15:46.840]  famous for staging things or using real crises but then exacerbating them and
[15:46.840 --> 15:51.560]  everybody knows that so again all they're doing is building us up we're
[15:51.560 --> 15:57.040]  getting more traffic more viewers more supporters we're selling more products
[15:57.040 --> 16:01.480]  we're getting more sponsors knocking down our doors which shows how pathetic
[16:01.480 --> 16:07.320]  MSM is but it also shows the fact that they are targeting people who are on
[16:07.320 --> 16:11.640]  the fence and don't know if MSM is telling the truth or not they're trying
[16:11.640 --> 16:15.360]  to bully and intimidate anybody that asks questions so let's look at these
[16:15.360 --> 16:20.640]  stories here a new Ben Garrison cartoon based of course on my original term
[16:20.640 --> 16:25.680]  dinosaur media you've got ISIS working with MSM CNN you've got NBC they're down
[16:25.680 --> 16:28.880]  here in the water hole getting their money and here comes Stefan Malinu here
[16:28.880 --> 16:34.360]  comes Paul Watson here comes Cernovich here comes the info wars here comes
[16:34.360 --> 16:39.160]  Drudge here comes Breitbart and just like the meteors just like the asteroid
[16:39.160 --> 16:42.000]  just like the comet coming down and killing the dinosaurs that's exactly
[16:42.000 --> 16:47.600]  what's happening here and then continuing this is a new story on info
[16:47.600 --> 16:53.040]  wars.com I apologize for watching fake news MSNBC pretends Obama campaign
[16:53.040 --> 16:58.480]  director is random woman on the street that's how dumb they think you are then
[16:58.480 --> 17:03.840]  there's a bunch of examples where they also have actors and staged events just
[17:03.840 --> 17:09.440]  lately below it remember this when they you know on election night had their own
[17:09.440 --> 17:12.240]  camera people being interviewed and claiming that they were just citizens
[17:12.240 --> 17:17.240]  this is why people don't trust them this is why people don't believe them this
[17:17.240 --> 17:23.560]  is an excellent article from zero hedge Alex Jones implores NBC not to air
[17:23.560 --> 17:27.280]  interview with liar Megan Kelly this article better than anyone I've seen I
[17:27.280 --> 17:31.680]  want to post on info wars.com breaks down exactly how I feel what's actually
[17:31.680 --> 17:36.720]  happened it's from iBankcoin.com originally it's from zero point now is
[17:36.720 --> 17:39.800]  who posted it this this article I need to get this person to write for info
[17:39.800 --> 17:43.600]  wars they absolutely get where I stand they're journalists they actually
[17:43.600 --> 17:47.360]  reported on what I said they showed my quotes going back over years saying I
[17:47.360 --> 17:50.680]  don't know what happened but it's got more holes on other Swiss cheese and you
[17:50.680 --> 17:55.040]  know I believe kids die but it needs to be investigated and there's definitely a
[17:55.040 --> 18:00.680]  cover-up of the particulars they really get it together here very very important
[18:00.680 --> 18:06.120]  article and they also understand it's big news when this is a top story and I'm
[18:06.120 --> 18:12.480]  saying hey I want the interview pulled but nobody will cover it you I say
[18:12.480 --> 18:17.040]  today and a few others now let's continue right here with this again this
[18:17.040 --> 18:20.440]  computer is locking up maybe that'll shut down here in just a minute the point
[18:20.440 --> 18:26.560]  is ladies and gentlemen the globalist are absolutely panicking right now and
[18:26.560 --> 18:29.680]  we come back from break here in a few minutes I will get into some more of the
[18:29.680 --> 18:35.240]  history and some more of these articles and go over documented cases where our
[18:35.240 --> 18:40.160]  government claims kids are being killed when children aren't being killed not
[18:40.160 --> 18:43.960]  just the babies and incubators having their brains stomped out in Kuwait by
[18:43.960 --> 18:49.000]  Saddam Hussein's forces a PR firm totally fake fake video fake photos but
[18:49.000 --> 18:55.480]  but so many other modern cases of ISIS rebels hitting people with nerve gas and
[18:55.480 --> 18:58.600]  then blaming it again on the Russians and the UN even found that that was a
[18:58.600 --> 19:02.440]  staged event so if you have these staged events over and over and over again
[19:02.440 --> 19:06.640]  it's okay to question them but the bigger question is why are they attacking
[19:06.640 --> 19:10.400]  info wars why are they so desperate why are they coming after us because
[19:10.400 --> 19:14.160]  they're scared of the fact that we're the leading independent media that we
[19:14.160 --> 19:18.160]  understand the paradigm and that the operating system of the American reboot
[19:18.160 --> 19:23.360]  of restoring our republic was basically re-engineered by info wars and is now
[19:23.360 --> 19:28.080]  being adopted across the board we are writing the talking points now for
[19:28.080 --> 19:31.200]  conservative talk radio for the libertarian movement and for so many
[19:31.200 --> 19:35.560]  others we take the hit we get demonized we get attacked but we don't care
[19:35.560 --> 19:39.280]  because we popularize it and make it safe for others just like Trump is
[19:39.280 --> 19:42.720]  smashing political correctness we'll be right back after this break with more
[19:42.720 --> 19:45.880]  and then Owen Shroyer is coming up I'm taking off a little bit this morning to

[24:16.960 --> 24:44.520]  from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[24:47.960 --> 24:53.440]  ladies and gentlemen we are back live MSM the dinosaur media is absolutely
[24:53.440 --> 24:58.520]  panicking they do not know what to do and so now they are attempting to say
[24:58.520 --> 25:03.200]  that I'm even more evil than their top demon Putin and then I cannot be seen on
[25:03.200 --> 25:08.320]  NBC that will legitimize me no actually that will upset our listeners and folks
[25:08.320 --> 25:12.480]  that absolutely hate MSM the only reason I would go on it would be able to reach
[25:12.480 --> 25:16.200]  out to people that are still in the matrix and also experience the deception
[25:16.200 --> 25:21.520]  of Megan Kelly for myself which I did Megan Kelly needs the alternative media
[25:21.520 --> 25:26.400]  they need us not the other way around she needed this publicity and from my
[25:26.400 --> 25:29.480]  research I think the whole thing is basically staged she works with the
[25:29.480 --> 25:33.320]  Sandy Hook groups and this whole protest thing is about giving her massive
[25:33.320 --> 25:39.960]  attention so the interview gets record ratings for failed Megan Kelly Megan
[25:39.960 --> 25:44.760]  Kelly dropped his host for Sandy Hook groups gala over Alex Jones interview see
[25:44.760 --> 25:48.800]  she's deep in bed with this and Bloomberg admits he's used the Sandy Hook
[25:48.800 --> 25:54.560]  groups as a red shirt to wave around to demonize the Second Amendment and then
[25:54.560 --> 25:58.800]  blame all gun owners for the deaths again talk about a frame up talk about
[25:58.800 --> 26:02.840]  criminal and disgusting and using these poor grieving families Alex Jones
[26:02.840 --> 26:06.440]  doubles down Sandy Hook conspiracy theory and disgusting Megan Kelly interview
[26:06.440 --> 26:11.560]  because the way she edited the promo not what I said I said I believed that
[26:11.560 --> 26:15.720]  people died so again ladies and gentlemen this is the type of garbage
[26:15.720 --> 26:19.440]  that we're dealing with look I know I'm moving fast here and it's because there's
[26:19.440 --> 26:23.480]  so much evidence remember the British ambassador coming out and saying that
[26:23.480 --> 26:28.600]  clearly the false flag chemical attack a few months ago in Syria was carried out
[26:28.600 --> 26:32.080]  by the rebels as an attempt to get the US to come into the war I mean think
[26:32.080 --> 26:35.680]  about how our government funded the Arab Spring that's killed almost a million
[26:35.680 --> 26:39.520]  people and put radicals a hottest in power and Hillary makes jokes about I
[26:39.520 --> 26:43.480]  came I saw he died think about Madeline Albright who was Secretary of State of
[26:43.480 --> 26:48.720]  the Clintons saying yeah half million kids is no big deal dying in Iraq for our
[26:48.720 --> 26:53.440]  war with the sanctions the Clinton expanded again these are cold-blooded
[26:53.440 --> 26:58.880]  monsters and then they turn around and say we question events that clearly have
[26:58.880 --> 27:03.960]  big PR firms involved that we somehow are monsters and evil it isn't gonna work
[27:03.960 --> 27:09.560]  nothing can put mainstream media back together again everybody knows about the
[27:09.560 --> 27:13.360]  baby in the incubators everybody knows about other staged events everybody
[27:13.360 --> 27:19.040]  knows about CNN caught staging fake halls at town halls and CNN caught you know
[27:19.040 --> 27:23.040]  given the questions to Hillary from the debate beforehand and the wiki leaks and
[27:23.040 --> 27:27.480]  and how they're all colluding and the fake polls you guys are the globalists
[27:27.480 --> 27:30.600]  you're the enemies you're the people that have hijacked America you're the
[27:30.600 --> 27:33.880]  threat to our children you're the people that are cold and heartless and don't
[27:33.880 --> 27:38.280]  care not us but again I want to encourage people to read the zero hedge
[27:38.280 --> 27:45.160]  article that breaks it all down because they absolutely are on target with this
[27:45.160 --> 27:50.520]  report where they ask the questions that the media seems so scared that I might
[27:50.520 --> 27:55.000]  even actually talk about if the Megan Kelly interview aired why does the
[27:55.000 --> 27:58.240]  Sandy Hook Elementary School website have zero traffic for four years before
[27:58.240 --> 28:01.720]  the event and show it was closed why were there several reports of other
[28:01.720 --> 28:05.080]  shooters dressed in camouflage in the woods that fled of whom the police
[28:05.080 --> 28:09.840]  allegedly detained why were porta potty sandwiches and fruit drinks and chips
[28:09.840 --> 28:15.360]  brought up and set up for the crime scene in just a hour or so Sandy Hook it
[28:15.360 --> 28:19.320]  just goes on and on an FBI crime stat which shows no murders occurred in
[28:19.320 --> 28:23.320]  Newtown in 2012 why didn't they let paramedics and EMTs in the building
[28:23.320 --> 28:26.920]  27 children were declared dead in eight minutes why was Adam Land's his home
[28:26.920 --> 28:31.480]  burned to the ground by the bank why have they declared all the records
[28:31.480 --> 28:36.200]  totally secret these are questions the public has they're the ones asking it
[28:36.200 --> 28:40.960]  they're the ones demanding it I've said I believe children did die there but PR
[28:40.960 --> 28:45.400]  firms were involved admittedly hyping it up as much as possible but there's been
[28:45.400 --> 28:50.120]  a cover-up and Anderson Cooper got caught faking where his location was with
[28:50.120 --> 28:54.800]  blue screen I mean it's all there we don't know what happened I believe kids
[28:54.800 --> 28:59.000]  died but the same media that's faking a bunch of other stuff and faking war
[28:59.000 --> 29:03.560]  propaganda is saying that I have said things that I never said that have been
[29:03.560 --> 29:07.440]  taken out of context and now won't report when I'm saying don't air the
[29:07.440 --> 29:12.380]  interview on Father's Day to hurt fathers and demonize men and that you
[29:12.380 --> 29:16.200]  edited me out of context and that I don't want to air it why won't they
[29:16.200 --> 29:21.000]  actually report on what I'm saying I'm Alex Jones this is the info war coming

[33:13.800 --> 33:21.840]  Alex Jones show and now your host Owen shroyer want to thank Maxine waters for
[33:21.840 --> 33:25.600]  bringing us in here on the Alex Jones show Owen shroyer filling in for Alex
[33:25.600 --> 33:29.960]  for about another half hour then Alex will be back and I will then be back
[33:29.960 --> 33:37.440]  also as well for the fourth hour it's just ridiculous the fake news against
[33:37.440 --> 33:40.480]  Alex Jones I don't honestly I don't I said this yesterday I don't even want to
[33:40.480 --> 33:43.600]  talk about it I don't even give it any credence by talking about it it's just
[33:43.600 --> 33:50.440]  hilarious these lefties come up to me at the Sharia protest on Saturday and they
[33:50.440 --> 33:54.240]  come up to me and they start laughing and cackling like your boss lost his kid
[33:54.240 --> 34:00.160]  and I'm just standing there like no no he didn't they're like what I read it I
[34:00.160 --> 34:06.400]  read that he did no not true at all fact again he's with them today so again
[34:06.400 --> 34:11.280]  the leftist totally falls for fake news all the time no discernment no critical
[34:11.280 --> 34:15.720]  thinking no logic no common sense and this is the reality that I live in I
[34:15.720 --> 34:18.880]  have to go on the streets and deal with these absolute zombies and then you can
[34:18.880 --> 34:21.920]  call them zombies right to their face and they don't even know what to do
[34:21.920 --> 34:27.280]  okay let's get into some of the news though this is really incredible stuff
[34:27.280 --> 34:31.240]  that's breaking today I guess this story actually broke yesterday and we're
[34:31.240 --> 34:35.640]  seeing this more and more you had the voter fraud found in Virginia now you've
[34:35.640 --> 34:42.880]  got voter fraud 12 Indiana Democrats charged with falsifying registration in
[34:42.880 --> 34:46.680]  October Indiana police raided the offices of the Indiana voter registration
[34:46.680 --> 34:50.960]  project in North Indianapolis in a growing voter fraud case so they've got
[34:50.960 --> 34:54.840]  all these growing voter fraud cases Barack Obama says that voter fraud
[34:54.840 --> 34:59.120]  doesn't exist rigged elections don't exist project Veritas exposes the crime
[34:59.120 --> 35:03.200]  that's going on inside the Democrat Party WikiLeaks exposes the crime that's
[35:03.200 --> 35:09.880]  going on in the Democrat Party but you know what we got today with all this
[35:09.880 --> 35:14.280]  build-up on the Democrats who are the ones that are trying to rig elections
[35:14.280 --> 35:18.400]  that's why they're blaming Russia folks because it was the Democrat and we'll
[35:18.400 --> 35:22.000]  get more into that that's what they do it's a solid linsky technique take what
[35:22.000 --> 35:27.640]  you're doing and then blame your opponent for doing that exact same thing so
[35:27.640 --> 35:31.360]  you've got all of these Democrats that are now getting caught with these voter
[35:31.360 --> 35:36.680]  fraud cases you can go back and look at acorn when Obama was running it perhaps
[35:36.680 --> 35:43.200]  the biggest documentation of voter fraud ever coming out of acorn and then
[35:43.200 --> 35:46.480]  Barack Obama tells you he's never heard of a rigged election as the Democrats
[35:46.480 --> 35:50.200]  are currently being investigated for voter fraud as the DNC has currently
[35:50.200 --> 35:55.040]  been sued for rigging the election against Bernie Sanders rigging the
[35:55.040 --> 36:01.800]  primary the Democrat process so Sean Lucas by the way who filed that lawsuit
[36:01.800 --> 36:11.200]  he's dead he's dead Seth Rich who was running the tech operations for voter
[36:11.200 --> 36:17.200]  rolls and voter logs inside the DNC yeah he's dead he's dead too and then a
[36:17.200 --> 36:24.400]  prosecutor in Florida who is looking into illegal visas and visa fraud he's
[36:24.400 --> 36:31.040]  dead and you got all of this proof building up of the Democrats rigging the
[36:31.040 --> 36:36.760]  election new stories breaking all the time voter fraud here voter fraud there
[36:36.760 --> 36:43.560]  but you know what we got today folks you know what we got today this should
[36:43.560 --> 36:51.000]  sicken you house Intel panel ad staff for Russia probe so we're putting more
[36:51.000 --> 36:55.640]  funding we're putting more time we're putting more energy we're putting more
[36:55.640 --> 37:02.920]  attention on this Russia probe which is a nothing of an investigation they've
[37:02.920 --> 37:09.040]  been investigating they found nothing and whatever they have found they haven't
[37:09.040 --> 37:13.360]  been able to link to Trump to bring him down which is the entire goal of this
[37:13.360 --> 37:19.840]  Russia investigation but don't you see of course the Democrats want you to look
[37:19.840 --> 37:23.840]  at Russia of course the Democrats want more funding to go to the Russia probe
[37:23.840 --> 37:27.480]  of course they want to appoint a new special counsel a new this more funding
[37:27.480 --> 37:31.800]  because that takes the attention off of them that takes the attention off the
[37:31.800 --> 37:37.320]  Democrats who are caught again rigging elections caught again voter fraud this
[37:37.320 --> 37:45.240]  time in Virginia and you wonder why this Russia probe continues to go on folks
[37:45.240 --> 37:52.920]  it is a distraction from the caught red-handed voter fraud trying to rig
[37:52.920 --> 37:58.440]  trying to hack the election that the Democrats are guilty of folks that's
[37:58.440 --> 38:05.840]  the goal of this entire thing and so now today everybody's praising Robert
[38:05.840 --> 38:13.800]  Mueller you had Paul Ryan gave he gave a speech today urging President Trump to
[38:13.800 --> 38:19.360]  let Robert Mueller do his job that's what they're all saying now we trust
[38:19.360 --> 38:26.280]  Mueller Mueller's the right guy for the job Paul Ryan says let Mueller do his
[38:26.280 --> 38:33.000]  job deputy AG Rosenstein says no good cause to fire Robert Mueller so
[38:33.000 --> 38:38.960]  obviously I think Trump perhaps or people within Trump's cabinet were getting a
[38:38.960 --> 38:43.240]  little suspicious of Robert Mueller perhaps stuff starts to surface and
[38:43.240 --> 38:50.160]  circulate about maybe him being relieved from this special investigation and so
[38:50.160 --> 38:55.520]  now the deep state the establishment the mainstream media is coming out telling
[38:55.520 --> 39:03.840]  you Robert Mueller good yes Robert Mueller good Robert Mueller trustworthy to try
[39:03.840 --> 39:09.120]  to hedge President Trump into a situation where he he feels like he can't
[39:09.120 --> 39:13.320]  relieve Mueller of these duties or fire Robert Mueller because now they're gonna
[39:13.320 --> 39:18.320]  say that again he's trying to obstruct justice he's trying to hide any evidence
[39:18.320 --> 39:22.560]  that they might be finding in this Russia probe where there is none and then
[39:22.560 --> 39:29.200]  you find this from life's at Paula's at Robert Mueller stock staff with Democrat
[39:29.200 --> 39:33.600]  donors special counsel's team includes former Clinton Foundation lawyer and
[39:33.600 --> 39:44.160]  contributors to Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton Wow shocking and you think that
[39:44.160 --> 39:51.120]  there's a reason for President Trump to be suspicious about a a former Bushite
[39:51.120 --> 39:57.440]  somebody who came up in the wings with the Bushes Robert Mueller's investigation
[39:57.440 --> 40:04.480]  into this so they have to solidify Mueller's position in order to trap
[40:04.480 --> 40:08.160]  President Trump and do not being able to relieve him from duty of course it
[40:08.160 --> 40:13.920]  doesn't even matter because he's not gonna find anything anyway it's just about
[40:13.920 --> 40:17.840]  the continuation it's about the continuation of the narrative it's
[40:17.840 --> 40:22.000]  about the continuation of the probe the continuation of the investigation they
[40:22.000 --> 40:26.360]  know there's nothing to be found it's about distraction and it's a Psyop as
[40:26.360 --> 40:30.240]  long as you keep this narrative going even though it's not real even though
[40:30.240 --> 40:34.360]  there's nothing to it as long as you keep it going it's still there it's still
[40:34.360 --> 40:40.960]  lingers it's still a shadow that they try to cast on President Trump and then
[40:40.960 --> 40:46.040]  of course if all of these depictions of his assassination come true well then
[40:46.040 --> 40:52.160]  you're just okay with that aren't you because he's been demonized that much
[40:53.080 --> 41:00.200]  meanwhile Vice President Mike Pence is giving speeches and recently he talked
[41:00.200 --> 41:04.360]  about Obamacare and I want to do highlight a couple tweets he made in
[41:04.360 --> 41:09.720]  Ohio last statewide insurer will leave Obamacare the maps red counties are
[41:09.720 --> 41:15.000]  without coverage more than 13,000 Ohio citizens will be affected and then he
[41:15.000 --> 41:20.480]  also tweets out the map right now a third of American counties including
[41:20.480 --> 41:24.000]  five whole states only have one choice of Obamacare coverage you know what
[41:24.000 --> 41:30.400]  that's called a monopoly a monopoly we're supposed to have anti-trust laws
[41:30.400 --> 41:36.920]  against monopolies but Barack Obama the good liberal comes in here and wrecks
[41:36.920 --> 41:44.880]  our health care by bringing in what is essentially a socialist health care
[41:44.880 --> 41:50.120]  system so you've got Barack Obama who tells you you can keep your doctor you
[41:50.120 --> 41:53.360]  can keep your health plan you've got Jonathan Gruber who comes out and says
[41:53.360 --> 41:58.240]  thank thank God the American public is so ignorant that they don't even know
[41:58.240 --> 42:03.520]  that we're screwing them over like this you've got Alex Jones who calls all of
[42:03.520 --> 42:08.000]  this out before it even goes down years before he gets demonized by the
[42:08.000 --> 42:13.320]  mainstream media so the mainstream media is now pushing back they're
[42:13.320 --> 42:16.960]  demonizing Alex Jones he's not allowed to do an interview with Megyn Kelly even
[42:16.960 --> 42:20.720]  though it's a total hit piece and even though Vladimir Putin just did one and
[42:20.720 --> 42:25.000]  he's apparently the most evil villain in the world right now it's okay for Megyn
[42:25.000 --> 42:29.240]  Kelly to interview him but again this is the same mainstream media folks that
[42:29.240 --> 42:34.240]  lies to you time and time again this is the same mainstream media that has been
[42:34.240 --> 42:39.240]  caught multiple times pretending to interview people in the street like it's
[42:39.240 --> 42:47.080]  a random man on the street interview when it's a former Obama campaign person
[42:47.080 --> 42:51.800]  campaign director they do this all the time you can go down Paul just watch
[42:51.800 --> 42:56.320]  and just wrote this story they've done this before they get cameraman they get
[42:56.320 --> 43:02.720]  Obama campaign directors they stage an entire fake news video pretending to be
[43:02.720 --> 43:07.080]  Muslims out there in the streets protesting for peace they stage the
[43:07.080 --> 43:10.960]  entire thing they got caught doing that again they stage videos like Charles
[43:10.960 --> 43:17.600]  Jacob pretending he's in Saudi Arabia so here's this video though of fake news
[43:17.600 --> 43:22.160]  making up a fake story about children and incubators and then trying to sell
[43:22.160 --> 43:28.040]  that to the American public the second week after an invasion I volunteered
[43:28.040 --> 43:33.360]  volunteered at the Al-Adhan hospital with 12 other women who wanted to help as
[43:33.360 --> 43:40.160]  well I was the youngest volunteer the other women were from 20 to 30 years old
[43:40.160 --> 43:45.160]  while I was there I saw the Iraqi soldiers coming to the hospital with guns
[43:45.160 --> 43:52.920]  they took the babies out of incubators thank you bears and let the children
[43:52.920 --> 43:56.160]  to die on the cold floor
[43:57.160 --> 44:04.080]  I was horrifying I cannot help but think of my nephew who if born premature
[44:04.080 --> 44:12.480]  might have died that day as well so that didn't happen and you've also got the
[44:12.480 --> 44:18.240]  mainstream media making up stories and the fearless leader has just entered the
[44:18.240 --> 44:23.360]  building I had to take my daughter the dentist no Alex the lefties told me that
[44:23.360 --> 44:25.720]  you don't have your kids anymore that's what they said it's victory for them
[44:25.720 --> 44:32.360]  that's yeah well okay whatever the media says is true and Iraq had WMD's but no
[44:32.360 --> 44:35.400]  seriously I now know exactly what happened with Mueller we have it from the
[44:35.400 --> 44:40.480]  White House the inside Intel's coming up we've got so much more breaking today so
[44:40.480 --> 44:45.520]  I'll be up in the second and third and fourth hour a huge broadcast coming up
[44:45.520 --> 44:49.720]  but boy they are really panicking keep going well and they should be panicking
[44:49.720 --> 44:53.840]  to especially with all of these under oath testimonies that are happening right
[44:53.840 --> 44:58.760]  now we're actually going to have another one today with sessions who is going to
[44:58.760 --> 45:03.240]  be having a hearing today this is the new thing now we build up these hearings
[45:03.240 --> 45:06.720]  we say countdown to it on the mainstream media it should be interesting to see
[45:06.720 --> 45:09.680]  because everybody built up the Comey thing that it was going to be some big
[45:09.680 --> 45:13.840]  bomb to drop on the presidency of Donald Trump that didn't happen nobody's
[45:13.840 --> 45:16.640]  really talking too much about the sessions testimony that's going to be
[45:16.640 --> 45:20.600]  happening maybe he's got a bomb to drop but then there's this bomb that comes
[45:20.600 --> 45:27.360]  out of the Gateway pundit Christina Lalia who has done good reporting in the
[45:27.360 --> 45:31.320]  past I found her reporting to be accurate every time I cover her stories
[45:31.320 --> 45:35.320]  on the Gateway pundit report Comey suspected of other leaks to the New
[45:35.320 --> 45:40.560]  York Times dating back to at least March now this is key because let's not
[45:40.560 --> 45:45.160]  forget we covered this on the Alex Jones show yesterday there's an interesting
[45:45.160 --> 45:49.560]  window of timing with James Comey's testimonies and the leaks that need to
[45:49.560 --> 45:54.440]  be investigated and that's from May 3rd when he gave his original testimony
[45:54.440 --> 46:01.120]  under oath saying he didn't leak to May 13th where a day after Trump's tapes
[46:01.120 --> 46:06.840]  tweet to which Comey said that he responded to by leaking to a friend to
[46:06.840 --> 46:12.200]  give to the media but the story that we suspect generated by the leak came out
[46:12.200 --> 46:19.160]  on May 11th so Comey would have had to have leaked or forgotten what day he
[46:19.160 --> 46:23.080]  leaked that to the New York Times especially if it was after May 3rd
[46:23.080 --> 46:27.640]  because that means it would have had to be between May 4th and May 13th which is
[46:27.640 --> 46:32.240]  when he said he did it but if that story in the New York Times about the secret
[46:32.240 --> 46:37.520]  meeting and Trump asking for Comey's honest loyalty is true then that doesn't
[46:37.520 --> 46:43.160]  collaborate with his testimony but now this story says that there's suspecting
[46:43.160 --> 46:49.840]  other leaks from Comey to the New York Times so if that's true if it is true
[46:49.840 --> 46:55.200]  that Comey had been leaking to the New York Times dating back to March then he
[46:55.200 --> 47:01.240]  did in fact commit perjury on May 3rd so that's why this is such a bombshell
[47:01.240 --> 47:08.680]  that's why they're so afraid and on just a total separate issue it shows you how
[47:08.680 --> 47:13.840]  absurd the Democrats are right now in fact I got another story on this this is
[47:13.840 --> 47:18.520]  how absurd the Democrats are right now where they all cry for Comey's head they
[47:18.520 --> 47:22.000]  all say Comey shouldn't have acted the way he did he cost Hillary the election
[47:22.000 --> 47:26.480]  he's not trustworthy he needs to be fired Trump fires Comey and then the left
[47:26.480 --> 47:32.160]  comes to his back so the total standard the total double standard party here but
[47:32.160 --> 47:37.560]  it goes on from the Daily Caller Chuck Schumer to block arms deal to Saudis
[47:37.560 --> 47:42.760]  despite backing arms deal under Obama Chuck Schumer is one of the dirtiest
[47:42.760 --> 47:49.280]  gangster mafia type people I think in our government is Democrat minority
[47:49.280 --> 47:52.760]  leader Chuck Schumer I wouldn't buy a pastrami sandwich from that guy if he was
[47:52.760 --> 47:58.460]  a deli salesman okay but he's a total shill he's a total fraud he's a total
[47:58.460 --> 48:03.880]  liar and you can see it on its face right here where he'll back an arms deal
[48:03.880 --> 48:07.520]  that Obama was willing to make with Saudi Arabia but not President Trump now
[48:07.520 --> 48:12.560]  of course this is funny because personally I don't like this arms deal to
[48:12.560 --> 48:16.560]  Saudi Arabia I don't think it's a good deal this is a thing that I don't like
[48:16.560 --> 48:23.800]  Trump on but Chuck Schumer doesn't like it either and neither does Rand Paul who
[48:23.800 --> 48:27.280]  actually thinks he's gonna surprise people with the amount of support that
[48:27.280 --> 48:31.520]  he's gonna get to stop this Saudi Arabian arms deal that President Trump made so
[48:31.520 --> 48:36.080]  we'll keep an eye on Rand Paul and his movement to stop the Saudi arms deal
[48:36.080 --> 48:39.960]  which if he starts to get Democrats on board with him then he actually might
[48:39.960 --> 48:42.880]  have some legs here and that's what he think and that's what he actually thinks
[48:42.880 --> 48:45.720]  it's gonna happen he thinks he can be Rand Paul thinks he's gonna surprise
[48:45.720 --> 48:49.600]  people with how much support he gets to try to stop the Saudi arms deal but
[48:49.600 --> 48:52.960]  folks we need you your support you know that they're trying to stop us they're
[48:52.960 --> 48:55.600]  trying to stop Alex Jones they're trying to shut him down they're trying to

[53:59.480 --> 54:15.800]  well this is rich DC Attorney General suing Trump is a big Clinton and Obama
[54:15.800 --> 54:23.160]  donor and this is truly rich folks I mean this this is a true knee slapper DC
[54:23.160 --> 54:27.480]  Attorney General Carl A. Racine and Maryland Attorney General Brian E.
[54:27.480 --> 54:31.720]  Frosh filed a lawsuit against the president on Monday here you go
[54:31.720 --> 54:36.600]  accusing him of violating the Constitution's emoluments clause by
[54:36.600 --> 54:45.440]  receiving payments from foreign leaders through his businesses I'm sorry these
[54:45.440 --> 54:50.120]  people again let me just let me just remind you let me just read the
[54:50.120 --> 54:54.560]  headline one more time for you DC Attorney General suing Trump is a big
[54:54.560 --> 55:03.280]  Clinton and Obama donor Clinton the woman notorious with her husband for
[55:03.280 --> 55:07.960]  taking all kinds of foreign money cutting deals with the Chinese cutting
[55:07.960 --> 55:13.200]  deals with the Saudis I mean this is ridiculous and they're suing Trump who
[55:13.200 --> 55:19.200]  actually has real business interests in these foreign countries for making
[55:19.200 --> 55:25.520]  deals this just shows you folks it doesn't even matter they know this lawsuit
[55:25.520 --> 55:29.160]  won't catch legs they know that they can't litigate here they know they can't
[55:29.160 --> 55:33.600]  win it's all about smearing president Trump it's all about putting the
[55:33.600 --> 55:37.280]  narrative out there they know there's no Russian collusion they know there's no
[55:37.280 --> 55:41.520]  Russian it meddling in our election they had no effect it's all about putting
[55:41.520 --> 55:45.240]  that false narrative out there keeping it in the talking points keeping it in
[55:45.240 --> 55:48.600]  the mainstream so that there's this constant subconscious conscious thing
[55:48.600 --> 55:52.400]  happening with Trump bad Trump bad even for the people that don't care even for
[55:52.400 --> 55:55.000]  the people that don't pay attention it's just lurking there lurking they're
[55:55.000 --> 55:58.080]  lurking there so then boom impeachment well of course impeachment he got sued
[55:58.080 --> 56:03.120]  all those times he was working with Russia he fired Comey he bad that's how
[56:03.120 --> 56:09.120]  this sigh up works and it'll be interesting to see if anything comes of
[56:09.120 --> 56:14.880]  this James Comey potentially leaking to the New York Times dating back to at
[56:14.880 --> 56:20.760]  least March that would mean he's guilty of perjury again May 3rd he said he had
[56:20.760 --> 56:25.920]  never leaked to media then he said in his most recent testimony he did leak to
[56:25.920 --> 56:30.480]  media in response to Trump's tapes tweet which happened on May 12th which means
[56:30.480 --> 56:35.400]  according to his testimony his leak had to happen after May 12th the New York
[56:35.400 --> 56:39.280]  Times story was published on May 11th so a lot of questions already with
[56:39.280 --> 56:44.480]  Comey's testimony but this puts even more questions into the air so we'll see
[56:44.480 --> 56:49.760]  what goes on with that and again Alex Jones is going to be joining us here in
[56:49.760 --> 56:54.320]  ten minutes he's got breaking news on the Robert Mueller deal breaking news on
[56:54.320 --> 56:59.240]  the entire waterfront even as he's scrambling around today you know and
[56:59.240 --> 57:03.960]  that's the most ridiculous thing about this whole Megan Kelly nonsense it's
[57:03.960 --> 57:07.000]  not that Alex Jones gets more attention than Vladimir Putin who's the evil
[57:07.000 --> 57:13.880]  world dictator controlling all the world's elections it's that even Megan
[57:13.880 --> 57:20.200]  Kelly totally disgraced totally discredited all of the mainstream media
[57:20.200 --> 57:24.560]  now nobody trusts it six percent positive trust in mainstream media
[57:24.560 --> 57:31.280]  according to two polls but they still think they control the narrative they
[57:31.280 --> 57:35.680]  still don't get it now I don't think Megan Kelly will air any of my segment
[57:35.680 --> 57:39.720]  that she did with me I think I outsmarted her but we'll find out
[57:39.720 --> 57:44.400]  about that she may just try to zoom in on my face that's probably what you'll do
[57:44.400 --> 57:49.440]  so she can't show my Hillary for prison shirt but they don't get it and I said
[57:49.440 --> 57:53.240]  this to her and her whole crew was looking at me like I was crazy I was
[57:53.240 --> 57:58.080]  like Megan you don't get it people don't care what you say anymore people don't
[57:58.080 --> 58:04.200]  care about your new show on NBC on Sunday nights they don't care they don't
[58:04.200 --> 58:08.240]  care if you publish a hit piece and make Alex Jones look bad you're only going to
[58:08.240 --> 58:15.400]  help us they don't get it yet they still don't get it yes Megan Kelly says
[58:15.400 --> 58:20.120]  it's important to shine a light on Alex Jones I asked Megan Kelly why did you go
[58:20.120 --> 58:24.560]  after President Trump so viciously in with your comment about Bush the Billy
[58:24.560 --> 58:28.160]  Bush tapes well I just had to ask him how it was gonna affect him you know but
[58:28.160 --> 58:32.400]  you didn't manage to ask Hillary Clinton about any of her past did you did
[58:32.400 --> 58:36.880]  you magic it's magic it's amazing how that happened isn't it we'll be right
[58:36.880 --> 58:44.080]  back Alex Jones coming up in the second hour you are listening to GCN visit
[58:44.080 --> 58:52.960]  GCN live calm today over the weekend act for America held human rights
[58:52.960 --> 58:57.600]  marches across the United States marching against Sharia law which prohibits
[58:57.600 --> 59:01.280]  certain human rights to women and countries where Sharia law is in practice
[59:01.280 --> 59:05.440]  oppress women so leave it to Antifa to show up and disrupt these Americans
[59:05.440 --> 59:08.800]  First Amendment right but it didn't stop there journalists like myself got
[59:08.800 --> 59:12.520]  assaulted and cursed at just for documenting the event Lauren Southern
[59:12.520 --> 59:17.120]  even had animal urine thrown at him while filming in the New York City march
[59:17.120 --> 59:22.720]  against Sharia if it wasn't obvious before it is now CNN and Antifa are ISIS
[59:22.720 --> 59:26.720]  left his freaked out when a burka was put on fearless girl in New York City
[59:26.720 --> 59:30.160]  faced with the imagery of the oppression they were supporting the same
[59:30.160 --> 59:34.000]  people that are now supporting Sharia law in America were the same people who
[59:34.000 --> 59:38.400]  were so helplessly offended by Donald Trump's grab her by the private comment
[59:38.400 --> 59:42.240]  so Trump's inappropriate private conversation is unacceptable but forced
[59:42.240 --> 59:47.360]  female genital mutilation is okay the left has literally lost their minds
[59:47.360 --> 59:51.520]  for info wars.com this is Owen shroyer
[59:51.520 --> 1:00:05.200]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:00:05.200 --> 1:00:11.680]  and now the tip of the spear leading the fight to take back the nation
[1:00:11.680 --> 1:00:23.120]  it's Owen shroyer you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:00:23.120 --> 1:00:27.360]  you know i'm sitting here covering all this news and
[1:00:27.360 --> 1:00:30.160]  i'm not going to get into my personal stuff but you know you get you get a
[1:00:30.160 --> 1:00:33.280]  text you find out something personal about a family member
[1:00:33.280 --> 1:00:36.720]  uh maybe not making it through the day you find out about people from your
[1:00:36.720 --> 1:00:40.800]  high school that have died multiple people from a high school have died
[1:00:40.800 --> 1:00:44.000]  from a heroin overdose it's it's it's it's really sad and
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:47.680]  i'm just sitting here thinking about just how precious life is
[1:00:47.680 --> 1:00:51.840]  and i'm looking at these democrats that cling
[1:00:51.840 --> 1:00:55.600]  to all of this fake news and not just i mean it's just it's so it's just
[1:00:55.600 --> 1:00:58.640]  nonsense nonsense a virtue signal all day long and you're just sitting here
[1:00:58.640 --> 1:01:03.600]  like you don't you support abortion
[1:01:03.600 --> 1:01:07.680]  how can you sit here in virtue signal all day over these non issues
[1:01:07.680 --> 1:01:13.440]  when you don't even protect the unborn life of innocent humans
[1:01:14.160 --> 1:01:20.960]  it's just it's it's just sickening and even like even politically even
[1:01:20.960 --> 1:01:24.480]  politically if you want to say all right i'm pro-choice because you can't
[1:01:24.480 --> 1:01:28.480]  stop abortions all right you know what but these people go out in the streets
[1:01:28.480 --> 1:01:32.880]  they want people to die they want abortion they literally want abortion
[1:01:32.880 --> 1:01:38.480]  and then when you tell black lives matter why don't you protest in front of the
[1:01:38.480 --> 1:01:42.000]  abortion clinics why don't you protest for the millions of black
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:45.040]  aborted babies more more black people are aborted than any
[1:01:45.040 --> 1:01:47.440]  other race why aren't you talking about that
[1:01:47.440 --> 1:01:51.680]  you don't get anything they don't care they don't even care about life
[1:01:51.680 --> 1:01:55.440]  they it's like they hate themselves so much
[1:01:55.440 --> 1:01:58.560]  they take for granted everything they've been given so much that they just
[1:01:58.560 --> 1:02:02.560]  they're just constantly filled with hate and they want to hold up their
[1:02:02.560 --> 1:02:05.920]  sides that say love trumps hate but in reality
[1:02:05.920 --> 1:02:10.240]  in their lives hate has trumped love
[1:02:10.240 --> 1:02:14.800]  and i think that's obvious now when you've got the la pride parade
[1:02:14.800 --> 1:02:17.600]  the gay pride parade in la that's been going on for decade
[1:02:17.600 --> 1:02:20.640]  they're not doing it this year instead what they're having in its place an
[1:02:20.640 --> 1:02:23.600]  anti-trump march
[1:02:25.520 --> 1:02:28.080]  i mean trump
[1:02:28.080 --> 1:02:33.040]  in a way kathy griffin was not kidding i mean trump has literally ruined these
[1:02:33.040 --> 1:02:36.560]  people's lives but it's not trump it's the mainstream media that lied about
[1:02:36.560 --> 1:02:39.040]  trump it's the mainstream media that lied to them told
[1:02:39.040 --> 1:02:43.200]  them hillary was going to win they were sold a false bill of goods
[1:02:43.200 --> 1:02:48.080]  they invested everything in the false bill of goods and they lost it all
[1:02:48.080 --> 1:02:52.240]  so now they're behaving like petulant children like mindless zombies
[1:02:52.240 --> 1:02:55.840]  and we're truly seeing the nature of these mindsets
[1:02:55.840 --> 1:02:58.800]  of these people's mindsets out on the streets
[1:02:58.800 --> 1:03:02.160]  alex jones is about to be back folks there's all kinds of news literally a

[1:03:56.240 --> 1:04:00.240]  at the site of the president's assassination what is wrong with these
[1:04:00.240 --> 1:04:03.280]  people and then delta airlines comes out and says look
[1:04:03.280 --> 1:04:07.120]  this isn't even a this isn't even a political issue with us
[1:04:07.120 --> 1:04:11.120]  this is not tasteful this is disgusting why would we support
[1:04:11.120 --> 1:04:14.240]  art that depicts the president getting assassinated
[1:04:14.240 --> 1:04:17.840]  which isn't art it's clearly a political message they have women
[1:04:17.840 --> 1:04:21.120]  and and black people stabbing him which is clearly a subconscious
[1:04:21.120 --> 1:04:24.720]  subliminal message so that's all this is snoop dog
[1:04:24.720 --> 1:04:28.080]  pretends to assassinate trump kathy lee griffin pretends to assassinate
[1:04:28.080 --> 1:04:30.560]  trump these people want sharia law in america
[1:04:30.560 --> 1:04:34.720]  they have become isis we are now fighting isis
[1:04:34.720 --> 1:04:39.280]  it's loving ah i love you sharia's peaceful
[1:04:39.280 --> 1:05:00.640]  islam alex jones coming up breaking news on the other side
[1:05:00.640 --> 1:05:05.200]  the collapse of the left continues if it isn't maxine waters or nancy polosi
[1:05:05.200 --> 1:05:09.040]  having a mental breakdown if it isn't snoop doggy dog pretending to shoot
[1:05:09.040 --> 1:05:12.720]  president trump if it isn't kathy griffin going full isis and depicting
[1:05:12.720 --> 1:05:16.400]  herself with a decapitated trump pet it's the new york public theater
[1:05:16.400 --> 1:05:19.360]  depicting the assassination of president trump in their latest
[1:05:19.360 --> 1:05:22.960]  installment of shakes pier in the park the play depicted president trump as
[1:05:22.960 --> 1:05:26.480]  the modern day julius caesar this time being stabbed to death by
[1:05:26.480 --> 1:05:29.360]  minorities and women a clear subliminal message
[1:05:29.360 --> 1:05:34.160]  leave it to cnn to endorse such an atrocity as feride zikaria said the
[1:05:34.160 --> 1:05:37.760]  play is a masterpiece but the disturbing presentation did not go
[1:05:37.760 --> 1:05:41.120]  without consequences as major sponsors of the theater have now
[1:05:41.120 --> 1:05:45.760]  pulled their sponsorship dollars such as delta airlines and bank of america who
[1:05:45.760 --> 1:05:49.360]  have supported the theater to the tunes of millions in the past

[1:06:42.800 --> 1:06:45.280]  dollars one of these systems can keep eight hundred

[1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:06.960]  to the radio host alex jones
[1:08:06.960 --> 1:08:12.800]  who claims that 9 11 and the oklahoma city bombings were inside jobs i don't
[1:08:12.800 --> 1:08:17.600]  know what happens in somebody's mind or how
[1:08:17.600 --> 1:08:22.000]  dark their heart must be to say things like that the russians
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:26.960]  ran an extensive information war campaign
[1:08:26.960 --> 1:08:32.480]  against my campaign to influence voters in the election
[1:08:32.480 --> 1:08:36.720]  and then they began to weaponize them and they began to
[1:08:36.720 --> 1:08:44.480]  have some of their allies within the uh internet world like info wars take out
[1:08:44.480 --> 1:08:50.160]  pieces and began to say the most outrageous outlandish absurd lies you
[1:08:50.160 --> 1:08:53.440]  can imagine but trump doesn't challenge these lies
[1:08:53.440 --> 1:08:58.880]  he actually went on jones's show and said your reputation is amazing i will
[1:08:58.880 --> 1:09:01.840]  not let you down
[1:09:02.560 --> 1:09:08.640]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front
[1:09:08.640 --> 1:09:12.320]  lines of the info war
[1:09:15.840 --> 1:09:19.520]  a lot of people say alex you ought to watch out hillary clinton's overthrown
[1:09:19.520 --> 1:09:23.200]  countries she's been connected to the murder of hundreds of people in
[1:09:23.200 --> 1:09:28.400]  arkansas and dc you're really poking a monster
[1:09:28.400 --> 1:09:31.440]  don't you know they could come after you well of course i know that they have
[1:09:31.440 --> 1:09:35.200]  come after me they're trying to kill my character and kill my name
[1:09:35.200 --> 1:09:40.000]  through the giant corrupt msm media that they control
[1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:43.200]  the entire narrative that i'm being hit with
[1:09:43.200 --> 1:09:46.880]  right now the number one news story yesterday
[1:09:46.880 --> 1:09:50.640]  to the top five today is alex jones megan kelly
[1:09:50.640 --> 1:09:56.320]  that's the top search yesterday according to google according to twitter
[1:09:56.320 --> 1:10:00.320]  you name it and this is going to go on throughout the
[1:10:00.320 --> 1:10:05.200]  next week when this piece supposedly airs and the
[1:10:05.200 --> 1:10:08.880]  the show that she hosts doesn't even have that many viewers
[1:10:08.880 --> 1:10:14.720]  it's the spectacle and the disinformation and the lies and the
[1:10:14.720 --> 1:10:18.480]  twisting my quotes that's what this is really all about
[1:10:18.480 --> 1:10:24.000]  to destroy what the establishment sees as one of the main bastions of americana
[1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:28.960]  and liberty left that is watching trump's flank
[1:10:28.960 --> 1:10:33.040]  as he attempts to cut the taxes secure the border turn the stock market back on
[1:10:33.040 --> 1:10:37.680]  and bring our jobs back say what you want he's an american president
[1:10:37.680 --> 1:10:42.000]  he's actually in charge and they don't like it special interests think they own
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:45.920]  this country they think they own you
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:50.240]  i want to be clear i as an individual am very very proud of these attacks
[1:10:50.240 --> 1:10:55.120]  i am very very honored i'm holding my head very very high
[1:10:55.120 --> 1:10:59.040]  in front of trendies that run up to me at stores and on the street and laugh
[1:10:59.040 --> 1:11:04.480]  and say i've lost my children uh and say that i got sued over
[1:11:04.480 --> 1:11:09.120]  sandy hook they just mix it all together and lies i've not been sued
[1:11:09.120 --> 1:11:12.640]  the one lawsuit was shabbani yogurt and they couldn't wait to get out of it
[1:11:12.640 --> 1:11:16.880]  let's just say we're very very pleased with what happened in the settlement
[1:11:16.880 --> 1:11:20.240]  as i said i would never give up i would be victorious and
[1:11:20.240 --> 1:11:26.400]  well they don't want the details of the settlement out
[1:11:26.400 --> 1:11:31.280]  let's just say it's not cash on the bottom for mr jones like mr cobert said
[1:11:31.280 --> 1:11:34.320]  no that'd be the bizarro world interpretation we don't know about
[1:11:34.320 --> 1:11:38.640]  bizarro world it's butt backwards but i'm not going to get into the settlement
[1:11:38.640 --> 1:11:41.520]  there the point is is that i figured out what these
[1:11:41.520 --> 1:11:45.680]  lawsuits and threats of suits are about is to get a pr campaign going that i'm
[1:11:45.680 --> 1:11:49.120]  in trouble that we're declining that we're collapsing they've even run that
[1:11:49.120 --> 1:11:52.480]  sigh up here i've learned lately in austin against us in some
[1:11:52.480 --> 1:11:56.400]  weak minds believed it we've never had more visitors
[1:11:56.400 --> 1:12:00.080]  we've never had more support we've never had more affiliates we've never been
[1:12:00.080 --> 1:12:04.160]  reaching more people in the aggregate to be clear
[1:12:04.160 --> 1:12:07.200]  maybe give me a document cam shot for tv viewers
[1:12:07.200 --> 1:12:13.440]  you go back to the launch of info wars in 1996 registered 1997 so the real
[1:12:13.440 --> 1:12:21.040]  launch is about 1997 to 2017 the growth curve
[1:12:21.040 --> 1:12:24.320]  ought to go into google analytics and show folks this has been basically
[1:12:24.320 --> 1:12:28.160]  something about like this and then the election came
[1:12:28.160 --> 1:12:31.040]  and then we went down a little bit from that peak but around a new
[1:12:31.040 --> 1:12:34.000]  plateau and normally the summer is a slower time
[1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:37.280]  we're now growing back towards our peak in the summer
[1:12:37.280 --> 1:12:41.440]  unprecedented while all other libertarian and conservative sites
[1:12:41.440 --> 1:12:46.640]  have gone down after the election and leftist sites have gone down even
[1:12:46.640 --> 1:12:51.040]  further not us we're climbing back to an all time high
[1:12:51.040 --> 1:12:55.600]  so rumors of our demise have been greatly exaggerated
[1:12:55.600 --> 1:12:59.840]  and that's why msm that's why the enemy media is in a total hysteria because
[1:12:59.840 --> 1:13:02.560]  they've got better analytics than we do they know
[1:13:02.560 --> 1:13:06.400]  we can just see our sites and our platforms it's untold the effect
[1:13:06.400 --> 1:13:10.160]  that info wars videos and articles and your commentary and your analysis
[1:13:10.160 --> 1:13:13.520]  is having because our videos our articles
[1:13:13.520 --> 1:13:18.400]  get spread other people make videos about them or you comment on them and it's
[1:13:18.400 --> 1:13:22.240]  just exponential not just in cyberspace but on the ground
[1:13:22.240 --> 1:13:26.960]  know this in our information warfare offensive against the globalist forces
[1:13:26.960 --> 1:13:31.120]  that have hijacked this nation we're having devastating victories
[1:13:31.120 --> 1:13:35.440]  i liken this to 1944 world war two we're closing in
[1:13:35.440 --> 1:13:41.040]  on the right chancellery underneath the government building there in berlin
[1:13:41.040 --> 1:13:44.560]  and the enemy's gonna sit there and declare they've had victory until the
[1:13:44.560 --> 1:13:48.320]  very end the megan kelly's and the
[1:13:48.320 --> 1:13:53.280]  somner redstones and the the michael moors and the the nancy poloses and the
[1:13:53.280 --> 1:13:57.520]  hillary clinton's and the barack obama's these these arrogant war criminal
[1:13:57.520 --> 1:14:01.680]  anti-american radical jihad backing scum
[1:14:01.680 --> 1:14:05.520]  like chelsea clinton crawls out from under the refrigerator
[1:14:05.520 --> 1:14:09.200]  uh you know at midnight to say that i'm a cockroach
[1:14:09.200 --> 1:14:13.600]  oh yeah that's one of the statements out of her mouth reportedly in others
[1:14:13.600 --> 1:14:18.160]  lady your family is what i would describe as the closest thing to cockroaches but
[1:14:18.160 --> 1:14:23.120]  that's an insult to cockroaches i mean total crime total evil constantly
[1:14:23.120 --> 1:14:26.320]  hanging out with pedophiles constantly hanging out with people convicted of
[1:14:26.320 --> 1:14:30.560]  abusing children child predators from weiner to your daddy to all of them
[1:14:30.560 --> 1:14:33.600]  well your step daddy we all know hobbles your real daddy
[1:14:33.600 --> 1:14:38.000]  webs are hobble and you're in the wiki leaks
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:41.440]  with a cya going these people are dying we're killing these people
[1:14:41.440 --> 1:14:44.480]  we're stealing billions as they starve to death and their water supply
[1:14:44.480 --> 1:14:48.160]  has cholera mommy and daddy but you didn't do anything to stop it
[1:14:48.160 --> 1:14:52.320]  you knew you were murdering thousands of little children
[1:14:52.320 --> 1:14:57.680]  chelsea clinton personally oversaw the murder of children that fat pig
[1:14:57.680 --> 1:15:00.960]  that disgusting maggot i call her a fat pig i don't mean
[1:15:00.960 --> 1:15:03.920]  physically a fat pig i mean her her bloated
[1:15:03.920 --> 1:15:06.880]  greediness her spirit weighs about 85 trillion
[1:15:06.880 --> 1:15:12.320]  you know pounds of pus and then you climb out from under a refrigerator in
[1:15:12.320 --> 1:15:16.400]  the middle of the night point your antennas at me
[1:15:16.400 --> 1:15:20.720]  with some big pr firm they've been running with bloomberg for years
[1:15:20.720 --> 1:15:25.760]  that that i hate the children of sandy hook and i hope they all this other bs
[1:15:25.760 --> 1:15:30.080]  my listeners didn't believe a word we had the email from bloomberg the day
[1:15:30.080 --> 1:15:34.640]  before saying get ready for the big event get ready to have our big roll
[1:15:34.640 --> 1:15:37.200]  out tomorrow and then the port of potty's were being
[1:15:37.200 --> 1:15:41.120]  delivered an hour after the shooting on and on and on all we said is boy
[1:15:41.120 --> 1:15:45.280]  somebody knew this was coming and they were sure geared up for it with pr and
[1:15:45.280 --> 1:15:48.000]  then a lot of listeners thought the feds went in and shot all the kids and
[1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:51.440]  other listeners thought it was all crisis actors
[1:15:51.440 --> 1:15:54.720]  and then other listeners thought it all happened it was real and we had debates
[1:15:54.720 --> 1:15:58.800]  about it and looked at it because when you've got a government
[1:15:58.800 --> 1:16:05.840]  staging that babies had their brains stomped out by iraqi troops in collate
[1:16:05.840 --> 1:16:11.040]  start the war in 1990 1991 and it's admitted all to be a pr firm
[1:16:11.040 --> 1:16:15.520]  and completely fake and then other pr firm garbage and the white helmets caught
[1:16:15.520 --> 1:16:19.040]  staging terror attacks that's mainstream news to get us into the latest war
[1:16:19.040 --> 1:16:22.800]  and isis caught staging chemical attacks and our media going along with it
[1:16:22.800 --> 1:16:27.520]  and promoting it under obama if our governmental back isis and al-qaeda
[1:16:27.520 --> 1:16:30.640]  to kill hundreds of thousands of people and put tens of thousands of women and
[1:16:30.640 --> 1:16:34.560]  children to sex slavery and that's even the mainstream news and get away with
[1:16:34.560 --> 1:16:38.240]  that absolutely obama and hillary and the
[1:16:38.240 --> 1:16:42.160]  globalist would be capable of going in and killing kids
[1:16:42.160 --> 1:16:46.160]  in a staged event or having actors they're completely
[1:16:46.160 --> 1:16:53.520]  and totally capable of it but i have never waffled on my stance on this the
[1:16:53.520 --> 1:16:56.880]  media has taken the fact that i've covered all the angles and said we
[1:16:56.880 --> 1:17:00.080]  don't know but it's legitimate to question because
[1:17:00.080 --> 1:17:03.360]  they're such liars then they hold up a mother or
[1:17:03.360 --> 1:17:06.880]  father these people look legitimate and say no i lost my
[1:17:06.880 --> 1:17:09.440]  child and we're like okay then that may have happened
[1:17:09.440 --> 1:17:12.880]  the point is we can't believe a word comes out of this corrupt government's
[1:17:12.880 --> 1:17:16.240]  mouth when it was run by the clinton's and obama and others they've been caught
[1:17:16.240 --> 1:17:19.520]  lying so many times and rigging elections and stealing and killing and
[1:17:19.520 --> 1:17:24.160]  everything else it's totally normal when cnn's been caught faking locations
[1:17:24.160 --> 1:17:28.000]  and faking events over and over and over again so they act like i'm
[1:17:28.000 --> 1:17:31.520]  waffling they go sometimes he says the feds killed everybody
[1:17:31.520 --> 1:17:35.440]  other times he says it was all actors other times he says it's all real
[1:17:35.440 --> 1:17:40.160]  because i've sat there in wargame just like i just did completely
[1:17:40.160 --> 1:17:44.400]  straight shooting right out of texas in everybody's face
[1:17:44.400 --> 1:17:47.280]  that's what they can't handle so they can take those clips probably on the news
[1:17:47.280 --> 1:17:54.160]  tonight jones said the feds shot everybody first he said it was actors no
[1:17:54.160 --> 1:17:59.520]  you edited out of context and hillary did what i said and i stand by what i
[1:17:59.520 --> 1:18:03.440]  said four years ago five years ago i stand by what i said last night i
[1:18:03.440 --> 1:18:07.040]  stand by what i said today now some will ask in this whole
[1:18:07.040 --> 1:18:11.840]  scyop war where we use truth they use lies
[1:18:11.840 --> 1:18:15.120]  why have you announced last night or maybe you didn't hear it because it got
[1:18:15.120 --> 1:18:19.360]  almost no coverage number one story in the country
[1:18:19.360 --> 1:18:23.520]  bigger than sessions testimony coming up right now that's becoming the top story
[1:18:23.520 --> 1:18:27.200]  but the two stories are at the top and i come out
[1:18:27.200 --> 1:18:31.120]  and make a statement to millions of people live on live streams
[1:18:31.120 --> 1:18:34.880]  bypassing msm dinosaur media
[1:18:34.880 --> 1:18:39.040]  and i say meghan kelly told me it wasn't about this that she misrepresented
[1:18:39.040 --> 1:18:41.600]  what i said in that edit to make it look like that i'm
[1:18:41.600 --> 1:18:45.120]  absolutely saying sandy hook didn't happen and that's not what i said i said i
[1:18:45.120 --> 1:18:49.360]  did believe kids died at it and i'm sick of this and i'm tired of it
[1:18:49.360 --> 1:18:52.720]  and so you know what i join with folks and say don't air it
[1:18:52.720 --> 1:18:56.400]  not because i'm scared of the interview but because i don't need
[1:18:56.400 --> 1:19:02.160]  media to be quote legitimized it's a joke it's an attack piece
[1:19:02.160 --> 1:19:05.920]  but i wanted to then jump into the narrative and force them to report that
[1:19:05.920 --> 1:19:10.480]  i'm saying sandy hook probably happened but they won't do it
[1:19:10.480 --> 1:19:14.160]  only zero hedge and usa today and a few others ran it
[1:19:14.160 --> 1:19:18.160]  thousands of other publications say i doubled down
[1:19:18.160 --> 1:19:21.840]  and that i'm saying the parents aren't real and they're liars
[1:19:21.840 --> 1:19:26.160]  then the parents go on tv take the quote they've been given and say i said it
[1:19:26.160 --> 1:19:30.480]  this is the media deceiving just like they say the iraqis took babies out of
[1:19:30.480 --> 1:19:34.880]  incubators and stomp their brains out never happened
[1:19:34.880 --> 1:19:38.080]  hell they'll probably say i took babies at newtown out of incubators at the
[1:19:38.080 --> 1:19:42.160]  hospital that day and bash their brains out i didn't do that either

[1:24:26.080 --> 1:24:31.360]  we're in a massive battle for the future of western civilization
[1:24:31.360 --> 1:24:37.840]  we are seeing the anti-freedom pro-islamic globalist media engaged in
[1:24:37.840 --> 1:24:41.360]  total war against the few european nations trying to pull out of globalism
[1:24:41.360 --> 1:24:45.520]  against the uk against the united states and against australia
[1:24:45.520 --> 1:24:49.200]  against other countries like brazil that are trying to get out of it as well
[1:24:49.200 --> 1:24:52.160]  and just during the break i was walking around and
[1:24:52.160 --> 1:24:57.120]  there i am on fox news and then earlier i was in the break room and there i am
[1:24:57.120 --> 1:25:01.280]  on cnn i mean it is top two story top number one or
[1:25:01.280 --> 1:25:04.960]  number two you can debate it alex jones
[1:25:04.960 --> 1:25:10.320]  meghan kelly or the testimony of the attorney general today
[1:25:10.320 --> 1:25:15.600]  questions swirl around him he didn't put on a form that he met with a russian
[1:25:15.600 --> 1:25:19.360]  ambassador because the fbi said you don't do that as a senator obviously
[1:25:19.360 --> 1:25:22.240]  because you obviously meet with a mere capacity we mean separately in your
[1:25:22.240 --> 1:25:26.000]  private life and and they all know that but that's
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:28.880]  fake news so now there's hearings about that and
[1:25:28.880 --> 1:25:32.720]  grilling why did he fire comey because the democrats said he was the worst ever
[1:25:32.720 --> 1:25:36.560]  and he's totally political and three of the people on the new
[1:25:36.560 --> 1:25:41.360]  muller investigation that had it are all democrats and democrat donors
[1:25:41.360 --> 1:25:44.640]  this is absolutely sickening and we've got big muller news
[1:25:44.640 --> 1:25:49.200]  coming up the start of the next segment uh as well i've got inside baseball
[1:25:49.200 --> 1:25:52.640]  inside scoops and a bunch of clips we're going to get to as well
[1:25:52.640 --> 1:25:56.080]  cnn's brian steller bemoan's inherent distrust
[1:25:56.080 --> 1:26:00.240]  the public has for the media but then two weeks ago we have cnn caught
[1:26:00.240 --> 1:26:06.400]  producing fake protest scenes that violate just the 101 handbook of journalism
[1:26:06.400 --> 1:26:10.880]  and here's today but we're supposed to trust
[1:26:10.880 --> 1:26:16.640]  these people fake news msnbc pretends obama campaign director
[1:26:16.640 --> 1:26:20.240]  is random woman on the street they even stage it oh
[1:26:20.240 --> 1:26:24.000]  who's this lady let's see what she thinks oh
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:27.760]  fake news oh but we're supposed to just trust them
[1:26:27.760 --> 1:26:31.840]  when they got caught doing blue screens at sandy hook and weren't on location and
[1:26:31.840 --> 1:26:34.640]  we're caught staging shots we're like we don't know what happened they probably
[1:26:34.640 --> 1:26:37.200]  killed some people and we were sad you know
[1:26:37.200 --> 1:26:40.320]  sad with the folks whatever don't blame gun owners though
[1:26:40.320 --> 1:26:44.080]  see how disingenuous that is blaming gun owners that have done nothing
[1:26:44.080 --> 1:26:47.200]  we're the ones that should be mad but instead they spin it around like oh you
[1:26:47.200 --> 1:26:50.880]  question the media that's known liars you hate children no no
[1:26:50.880 --> 1:26:54.080]  we don't hate the half million iraq he's the clinton's killed with their
[1:26:54.080 --> 1:26:57.440]  expanded sanctions that madeline albright said it was a good thing it's a
[1:26:57.440 --> 1:27:00.320]  good thing that they died we play that clip again for you
[1:27:00.320 --> 1:27:03.680]  because the fake left just bemoans how they get hurt
[1:27:03.680 --> 1:27:06.880]  and how they get sad and that's what i've said to megan kelly
[1:27:06.880 --> 1:27:10.000]  i said you know they lied about wmds they lied about the
[1:27:10.000 --> 1:27:15.280]  babies and the incubators and they're lying about
[1:27:15.280 --> 1:27:19.040]  what happened in iraq but but the media doesn't cover that and then she just
[1:27:19.040 --> 1:27:22.560]  cuts it in with me saying something about iraq where it just sounds like i
[1:27:22.560 --> 1:27:25.840]  just threw that in what i've been talking to her about
[1:27:25.840 --> 1:27:30.640]  newtown for 30 minutes but that's how they do it
[1:27:30.640 --> 1:27:34.720]  that's how they deceive so imagine
[1:27:34.720 --> 1:27:38.240]  i'm one of the top two stories in the country right now
[1:27:38.240 --> 1:27:44.400]  info wars and i've come out and said i believe kids died at newtown
[1:27:44.400 --> 1:27:47.440]  that's because i can't prove it any other way i have major questions i've
[1:27:47.440 --> 1:27:50.640]  investigated but just out of an abundance of
[1:27:50.640 --> 1:27:53.520]  caution a lot of those folks look like they're really grieving i'm sad for
[1:27:53.520 --> 1:27:56.960]  them i said that four years ago we've looked at all three angles
[1:27:56.960 --> 1:27:59.680]  did the government completely do it is it staged or isn't real because the
[1:27:59.680 --> 1:28:04.480]  public doesn't buy stuff that no liars do and they won't run it
[1:28:04.480 --> 1:28:07.840]  when i go on and talk to a million people online that tuned into different
[1:28:07.840 --> 1:28:11.440]  streams almost no coverage of alex jones saying
[1:28:11.440 --> 1:28:15.440]  i believe people died at newtown the media has misrepresented what i said
[1:28:15.440 --> 1:28:20.240]  and don't air the megan kelly interview only a handful of news articles out of
[1:28:20.240 --> 1:28:26.320]  thousands covering instead they show fox news everywhere else
[1:28:26.320 --> 1:28:30.000]  and say alex jones says no kids died here he is
[1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:34.320]  at a press conference about something completely different
[1:28:35.040 --> 1:28:38.240]  the only folks that got it totally accurate was zero hedge alex jones
[1:28:38.240 --> 1:28:42.880]  implores nbc not to air interview with liar megan kelly jp morgan pulls ads
[1:28:42.880 --> 1:28:46.560]  zero hedge got it right i bank coin dot com wrote the first story
[1:28:46.560 --> 1:28:50.400]  i want to post that in full that article in full wars dot com right now
[1:28:50.400 --> 1:28:55.200]  because with a sub context you know note from alex jones
[1:28:55.200 --> 1:28:59.920]  this article gets it 110 right it's got quotes of me four and a half years
[1:28:59.920 --> 1:29:02.560]  ago saying i don't know what happened at newtown
[1:29:02.560 --> 1:29:06.320]  but it's got more holes in it than swiss cheese maybe all the kids really did
[1:29:06.320 --> 1:29:09.200]  die maybe it's totally fake like some say or maybe
[1:29:09.200 --> 1:29:13.120]  they sent in a hit team to kill the kids but there's a cover up it's got all my
[1:29:13.120 --> 1:29:18.400]  quotes going back to the beginning of big thoughtful analysis questioning and
[1:29:18.400 --> 1:29:22.480]  i'm not running from this i'm proud of this i love the

[1:33:32.480 --> 1:33:34.480]  It's time to stop submitting to this charity.
[1:33:34.480 --> 1:33:36.480]  It's time to realize that we're being enslaved.
[1:33:36.480 --> 1:33:38.480]  I heard that on Alex Jones.

[1:34:02.480 --> 1:34:03.480]  I want freedom!
[1:34:03.480 --> 1:34:04.480]  That's what I want!
[1:34:04.480 --> 1:34:07.480]  And that's what Jason wants!
[1:34:07.480 --> 1:34:11.480]  Hello, this is Hank Hill, and I'm telling you what.
[1:34:11.480 --> 1:34:15.480]  You need to listen to Alex Jones.
[1:34:15.480 --> 1:34:16.480]  I like that guy.
[1:34:16.480 --> 1:34:17.480]  That is the best.
[1:34:17.480 --> 1:34:24.480]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[1:34:24.480 --> 1:34:32.480]  So, they're really mad that I will play clips of CNN, MSNBC, staging interviews, and faking things.
[1:34:32.480 --> 1:34:38.480]  And they faked dead children being killed, you know, children being murdered in incubators,
[1:34:38.480 --> 1:34:42.480]  to launch wars that killed millions and millions of people.
[1:34:42.480 --> 1:34:48.480]  And the very same MSN that's been behind these wars, killing millions of people in the Arab Spring,
[1:34:48.480 --> 1:34:54.480]  and funding the jihadist, they want to turn around and say that I don't care about kids,
[1:34:54.480 --> 1:34:59.480]  because my listeners and myself questioned the official story from Newtown.
[1:34:59.480 --> 1:35:00.480]  You bet we did.
[1:35:00.480 --> 1:35:06.480]  We don't believe a word comes out of MSM's mouth.
[1:35:06.480 --> 1:35:11.480]  And they said for two days that the San Bernardino attackers weren't Muslims.
[1:35:11.480 --> 1:35:15.480]  They told us, you know, don't call the gay nightclub attack.
[1:35:15.480 --> 1:35:21.480]  They came out and said, you know, whatever you do, don't you ever, ever, you know, call that Islamic.
[1:35:21.480 --> 1:35:25.480]  So, it's simply amazing.
[1:35:25.480 --> 1:35:33.480]  Now, before I go any further, I want to play some of these clips since we've got them here.
[1:35:33.480 --> 1:35:39.480]  And the first clip I want to play, we're just going to run these clips in together.
[1:35:39.480 --> 1:35:46.480]  Fake news MSNBC pretends Obama campaign director is random woman on the street.
[1:35:46.480 --> 1:35:55.480]  In a Vox Pop segment about the testimony of former FBI director James Comey, MSNBC was caught trying to pretend
[1:35:55.480 --> 1:36:01.480]  that a former Obama campaign director was just a random woman on the street.
[1:36:01.480 --> 1:36:07.480]  And then under the article by Paul Watson, we have a bunch of other examples of where they've just been recently caught
[1:36:07.480 --> 1:36:13.480]  doing this again like two weeks ago with the fake Islamic demonstrators being herded in to do this.
[1:36:13.480 --> 1:36:23.480]  And then again, we're supposed to just trust people that lie and lie and lie and lie and lie.
[1:36:23.480 --> 1:36:26.480]  So, I'm going to run these pieces together.
[1:36:26.480 --> 1:36:33.480]  I'm going to run CNN's Brian Stelter, Bamone's inherent distrust the public has in the background
[1:36:33.480 --> 1:36:35.480]  show the latest fake CNN footage.
[1:36:35.480 --> 1:36:40.480]  Then we're going to show MSNBC pretends Obama campaign director is a random woman on the street.
[1:36:40.480 --> 1:36:46.480]  And then we're going to air the clip of the CNN cameraman on election night at three in the morning when he learns
[1:36:46.480 --> 1:36:50.480]  Hillary's lost blowing up and yelling and acting like he's just a citizen on the street.
[1:36:50.480 --> 1:36:58.480]  This is the fakeness and this only scratches the surface of these incredible deceivers.
[1:36:58.480 --> 1:37:03.480]  And now they want to set the precedent that people like Alex Jones aren't even allowed on the air.
[1:37:03.480 --> 1:37:10.480]  So, Megan Kelly has to stop her interview with me because they don't want to legitimize me.
[1:37:10.480 --> 1:37:16.480]  Give me a break. There's nothing more discrediting than MSM agreeing with you.
[1:37:16.480 --> 1:37:21.480]  I wanted to be interviewed because I knew this was a set up hit piece so that everyone that's already awake
[1:37:21.480 --> 1:37:26.480]  would be reminded that we trailblazed exposing these monsters.
[1:37:26.480 --> 1:37:33.480]  This is a badge of honor and courage and the fact that brainwashed people and brain damaged people and zombies
[1:37:33.480 --> 1:37:43.480]  and useful idiots and fools and followers and weaklings and and quizlings are buying into this.
[1:37:43.480 --> 1:37:48.480]  That's I'm trying to reach them with hardcore knowledge, but some of them you can't help.
[1:37:48.480 --> 1:37:52.480]  We're here assaulting the globalist assaulting the fake media.
[1:37:52.480 --> 1:37:57.480]  We're going to Lionel, former prosecutor and media analyst to give his take on all this here in just a moment,
[1:37:57.480 --> 1:38:00.480]  but first hear those clips back to back.
[1:38:00.480 --> 1:38:06.480]  If you don't believe the media, then you probably don't believe that the Trump administration's had a dysfunctional few months.
[1:38:06.480 --> 1:38:13.480]  If you don't believe the media, you might not believe that Russia's meddling in last year's election is a very big deal.
[1:38:13.480 --> 1:38:21.480]  The trust in the media has been low for years and getting lower and the president feeds that inherent distrust with tweets like this.
[1:38:21.480 --> 1:38:27.480]  He is this morning saying the fake news MSM doesn't report the great economic news since election day.
[1:38:27.480 --> 1:38:32.480]  Obviously the press does report on job creation, stock market rectors, etc.
[1:38:32.480 --> 1:38:34.480]  Their entire business channels.
[1:38:34.480 --> 1:38:39.480]  But I think what he means is he wants the press to report it more often, more positively.
[1:38:39.480 --> 1:38:43.480]  In any case, we can see how this anti-media rhetoric is having a real effect.
[1:38:43.480 --> 1:38:51.480]  A new Quinnipiac poll shows that more than half the country 52% believes Trump has changed American attitudes toward the news media for the worse.
[1:38:51.480 --> 1:38:57.480]  22% says he's changed attitudes for the better and 20% say he has not an impact.
[1:38:57.480 --> 1:39:03.480]  An estimated 19 million Americans watched former FBI director James Comey's testimony before Congress on Thursday
[1:39:03.480 --> 1:39:10.480]  and now we're hearing a reaction from people across the country about whether Comey or President Trump is more believable.
[1:39:10.480 --> 1:39:17.480]  The clear message is that you should not continue with this investigation.
[1:39:17.480 --> 1:39:19.480]  Where there's smoke, there's fire.
[1:39:19.480 --> 1:39:27.480]  And the fact that he would make a very specific request to have everybody else leave the office so that he would be alone with Comey.
[1:39:27.480 --> 1:39:29.480]  For me, it speaks volumes.
[1:39:29.480 --> 1:39:36.480]  Because we've been talking about things that don't matter, things about personality, not policy.
[1:39:36.480 --> 1:39:47.480]  And there needs to be a call to action and I need Hillary to stand up right now and walk in and sue the United States of America and say
[1:39:47.480 --> 1:39:50.480]  back when black people couldn't, right, they couldn't vote, right?
[1:39:50.480 --> 1:39:53.480]  How many years ago your vote would have been one-third?
[1:39:53.480 --> 1:39:55.480]  Guess what? Today it still is.
[1:39:55.480 --> 1:39:57.480]  Today right now it still is.
[1:39:57.480 --> 1:40:01.480]  So you don't feel like this was a fair election because it looks like Donald Trump won fair and square.
[1:40:01.480 --> 1:40:03.480]  How did he win fair and square?
[1:40:03.480 --> 1:40:04.480]  Hillary had more votes.
[1:40:04.480 --> 1:40:06.480]  More human beings voted for Hillary.
[1:40:06.480 --> 1:40:07.480]  This isn't fair.
[1:40:07.480 --> 1:40:09.480]  We didn't get one vote.
[1:40:09.480 --> 1:40:10.480]  You didn't get a vote.
[1:40:10.480 --> 1:40:12.480]  It's just like back in the day when your vote was one-third.
[1:40:12.480 --> 1:40:15.480]  So the Electoral College, you're somebody who wants to blow that up.
[1:40:15.480 --> 1:40:16.480]  You want to get rid of the Electoral College.
[1:40:16.480 --> 1:40:17.480]  Just count the votes.
[1:40:17.480 --> 1:40:18.480]  It's ridiculous.
[1:40:18.480 --> 1:40:19.480]  Hillary, you're a lawyer.
[1:40:19.480 --> 1:40:20.480]  Walk in.
[1:40:20.480 --> 1:40:22.480]  Go to the Supreme Court.
[1:40:22.480 --> 1:40:23.480]  I believe in you, Hillary.
[1:40:23.480 --> 1:40:24.480]  I've been to Rwanda.
[1:40:24.480 --> 1:40:26.480]  I've been to your hospital in Rwanda.
[1:40:26.480 --> 1:40:28.480]  I've seen all the good you've done.
[1:40:28.480 --> 1:40:29.480]  I believe in you.
[1:40:29.480 --> 1:40:30.480]  Women need you.
[1:40:30.480 --> 1:40:31.480]  Minorities need you.
[1:40:31.480 --> 1:40:32.480]  I need you.
[1:40:32.480 --> 1:40:33.480]  Chicago needs you.
[1:40:33.480 --> 1:40:34.480]  We all need you.
[1:40:34.480 --> 1:40:39.480]  This country needs you to stand up and walk into the Supreme Court and say one vote equals
[1:40:39.480 --> 1:40:40.480]  one vote.
[1:40:40.480 --> 1:40:41.480]  What's wrong with that?
[1:40:41.480 --> 1:40:42.480]  What's the debate?
[1:40:42.480 --> 1:40:43.480]  So you can definitely feel his passion.
[1:40:43.480 --> 1:40:46.480]  There's other people out here who feel the same way.
[1:40:46.480 --> 1:40:49.480]  So that was, say, admitted, fake news, CNN, sigh up.
[1:40:49.480 --> 1:40:51.480]  Oh, here's a random man on the street.
[1:40:51.480 --> 1:40:54.480]  No, he's the cameraman, the producer, as well.
[1:40:54.480 --> 1:40:55.480]  He's also a producer.
[1:40:55.480 --> 1:41:00.480]  And he just gets in front of the television and lies to you and then launches the narrative
[1:41:00.480 --> 1:41:04.980]  right as it's announced at 3 a.m. that Trump's the winner, that we need to overthrow this
[1:41:04.980 --> 1:41:05.980]  president.
[1:41:05.980 --> 1:41:08.480]  And here we are eight months later.
[1:41:08.480 --> 1:41:09.480]  And they hate it.
[1:41:09.480 --> 1:41:10.480]  The economy's turned around.
[1:41:10.480 --> 1:41:12.480]  The borders are getting secured.
[1:41:12.480 --> 1:41:14.480]  Sovereignty is being returned.
[1:41:14.480 --> 1:41:15.480]  We're out of the TPP.
[1:41:15.480 --> 1:41:19.480]  We're out of the carbon tax that is only on the West, not on China and India.
[1:41:19.480 --> 1:41:20.480]  It's meant to shut us down.
[1:41:20.480 --> 1:41:24.480]  And they are so angry because they're bought and paid for by the multinational corporations
[1:41:24.480 --> 1:41:28.980]  that have pretty much taken this country over and are exploiting it just like third-world
[1:41:28.980 --> 1:41:29.980]  nations.
[1:41:29.980 --> 1:41:33.980]  And finally, our guest, former prosecutor, and, of course, syndicated radio and TV host
[1:41:33.980 --> 1:41:35.980]  in his own right in a moment.
[1:41:35.980 --> 1:41:41.980]  Before we do that, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to extend this one more day because
[1:41:41.980 --> 1:41:43.980]  it's so popular and, quite frankly, no big deal.
[1:41:43.980 --> 1:41:44.980]  They didn't take it down today.
[1:41:44.980 --> 1:41:46.980]  I came in and said, what are the new specials?
[1:41:46.980 --> 1:41:49.480]  And they said, we haven't come up with those yet.
[1:41:49.480 --> 1:41:55.980]  So I said, let's just extend super blue, fluoride-free, made in America toothpaste with iodine, colloidal
[1:41:55.980 --> 1:42:00.980]  silver, tea tree oil, peppermint, and more, super concentrated in a new advanced space
[1:42:00.980 --> 1:42:02.980]  age tube.
[1:42:02.980 --> 1:42:03.980]  It's amazing.
[1:42:03.980 --> 1:42:08.480]  Our best-selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock, 33% off retail price.
[1:42:08.480 --> 1:42:10.980]  But it will end today.
[1:42:10.980 --> 1:42:13.480]  The bubble gum for children flavor is out.
[1:42:13.480 --> 1:42:17.180]  Deep research indicates that unhealthy gums can contribute to the development of heart
[1:42:17.180 --> 1:42:18.480]  disease and even heart attacks.
[1:42:18.480 --> 1:42:19.980]  Now, that's the American Dental Association.
[1:42:19.980 --> 1:42:23.280]  You see with bacteria infect your gums, you can enter your bloodstream and contribute
[1:42:23.280 --> 1:42:24.280]  to blood clots.
[1:42:24.280 --> 1:42:28.780]  The super blue fluoride-free toothpaste is groundbreaking new formula that's loaded
[1:42:28.780 --> 1:42:32.280]  with the good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[1:42:32.280 --> 1:42:36.480]  Super blue also contains natural oils with ingredients used as biblical times to wipe
[1:42:36.480 --> 1:42:38.980]  out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[1:42:38.980 --> 1:42:43.480]  Just some of the ingredients in super blue chosen by our dental experts and formulation
[1:42:43.480 --> 1:42:47.280]  scientists include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nanosilver, and more.

[1:43:12.280 --> 1:43:13.780]  of toxic mouthwash.

[1:43:20.280 --> 1:43:22.780]  private labeled by us because the owner is a patriot.
[1:43:22.780 --> 1:43:23.780]  That's right.
[1:43:23.780 --> 1:43:24.780]  This is a godsend.
[1:43:24.780 --> 1:43:25.780]  A lot of people are freaking out.
[1:43:25.780 --> 1:43:28.780]  A lot of liberals and trendies that go to Whole Foods are like, because that is one good
[1:43:28.780 --> 1:43:29.780]  thing they do.
[1:43:29.780 --> 1:43:30.780]  That's some good products there.
[1:43:30.780 --> 1:43:31.780]  They're like, well, wait a minute.
[1:43:31.780 --> 1:43:32.780]  I've seen this deodorant before.
[1:43:32.780 --> 1:43:34.080]  I've seen this.
[1:43:34.080 --> 1:43:35.480]  This is like an end cap.
[1:43:35.480 --> 1:43:37.080]  This is one of the top brands.
[1:43:37.080 --> 1:43:38.080]  Yes, it is.
[1:43:38.080 --> 1:43:40.280]  Now private labeled Emmerich's essentials.
[1:43:40.280 --> 1:43:47.780]  25% off when you sign up for auto-ship on that, infowarsstore.com or triple-A-2533139.
[1:43:47.780 --> 1:43:49.880]  And finally, super combo.
[1:43:49.880 --> 1:43:51.980]  This is the new special we're running this week.
[1:43:51.980 --> 1:43:56.680]  It's Survival Shield X2, nascent iodine, and bio-trusillenium that's now back in stock
[1:43:56.680 --> 1:43:59.580]  for 25% off at infowarsstore.com.
[1:43:59.580 --> 1:44:03.000]  The two go together electrochemically like a horse and carriage.
[1:44:03.000 --> 1:44:04.680]  People ask how I have so much energy.
[1:44:04.680 --> 1:44:06.800]  It's bio-trusillenium and X2.
[1:44:06.800 --> 1:44:11.720]  The problem is it's raised my libido and helped clean out my body and block all the bad astrogens
[1:44:11.720 --> 1:44:12.880]  according to my own research.
[1:44:12.880 --> 1:44:13.880]  Do your own.
[1:44:13.880 --> 1:44:14.880]  Talk to your own physician.
[1:44:14.880 --> 1:44:22.680]  I'm turbo-charged and so it has accelerated my hair falling out, bottom line, but it's
[1:44:22.680 --> 1:44:27.920]  deficiencies in selenium and iodine that are in studies lower IQ, libido.
[1:44:27.920 --> 1:44:29.920]  It's totally jacking with women.
[1:44:29.920 --> 1:44:30.920]  Check it out.
[1:44:30.920 --> 1:44:31.920]  Talk to your physician or healthcare provider.
[1:44:31.920 --> 1:44:32.920]  Do your own research.
[1:44:32.920 --> 1:44:33.920]  It's amazing.
[1:44:33.920 --> 1:44:36.040]  But in my own personal life, it's been a world changer.
[1:44:36.040 --> 1:44:39.400]  Survival Shield and bio-trusillenium, infowarslife.com.
[1:44:39.400 --> 1:44:43.600]  Now joining us is Lionel.
[1:44:43.600 --> 1:44:47.800]  Of course, we'll give you his website, it's linelmedia.com.
[1:44:47.800 --> 1:44:53.520]  He's at Lionel Media on Twitter, does a great job, former prosecutor in a big city in Florida
[1:44:53.520 --> 1:44:57.600]  and of course, big syndicated radio and TV host for years on different big platforms
[1:44:57.600 --> 1:44:59.000]  out of New York City.
[1:44:59.000 --> 1:45:01.480]  I don't really know his view yet.
[1:45:01.480 --> 1:45:04.800]  I follow him almost every day, but I haven't the last few days.
[1:45:04.800 --> 1:45:05.960]  I already wanted to pop on.
[1:45:05.960 --> 1:45:09.400]  I don't know his view on Megan Kelly yet or this being one of the top stories in the
[1:45:09.400 --> 1:45:10.400]  world.
[1:45:10.400 --> 1:45:14.880]  I just know they're misrepresenting what I've said and I'm asking myself, why are they
[1:45:14.880 --> 1:45:17.920]  doing this to get it Trump, to get it to new media?
[1:45:17.920 --> 1:45:22.960]  I mean, they don't have this much propaganda before they launch a major war.
[1:45:22.960 --> 1:45:26.280]  I mean, I feel like I'm Saddam Hussein or something.
[1:45:26.280 --> 1:45:28.840]  Lionel, what do you think's going on?
[1:45:28.840 --> 1:45:32.640]  You pose an existential threat to the legacy media.
[1:45:32.640 --> 1:45:38.200]  First of all, whoever was the brain surgeon who said, let's get Alex Jones.
[1:45:38.200 --> 1:45:52.520]  Who by virtue of your Keblar soul is not susceptible or capable of bad information or publicity.
[1:45:52.520 --> 1:45:54.040]  It's your oxygen.
[1:45:54.040 --> 1:46:01.560]  Who was the idiot who said, let's get Alex Jones number one and number two makes.
[1:46:01.560 --> 1:46:02.960]  Why don't you do this?
[1:46:02.960 --> 1:46:05.200]  Why don't you try to catch him?
[1:46:05.200 --> 1:46:07.680]  What have you ever heard him?
[1:46:07.680 --> 1:46:09.560]  The man's encyclopedic.
[1:46:09.560 --> 1:46:11.480]  Why don't you catch him?
[1:46:11.480 --> 1:46:12.880]  What did you bring something up?
[1:46:12.880 --> 1:46:18.360]  Why don't you say, Alex, why would you ever doubt the official story of 9 11?
[1:46:18.360 --> 1:46:20.960]  The man can do it in a coma.
[1:46:20.960 --> 1:46:21.960]  What are you doing?
[1:46:21.960 --> 1:46:22.960]  What are you nuts?
[1:46:22.960 --> 1:46:25.600]  Now understand Alex, my dear friend.
[1:46:25.600 --> 1:46:27.280]  This is a woman who left Fox.
[1:46:27.280 --> 1:46:28.280]  Okay.
[1:46:28.280 --> 1:46:29.280]  She left Fox.
[1:46:29.280 --> 1:46:32.800]  She's going to NBC causing an absolute cataclysm.
[1:46:32.800 --> 1:46:34.080]  She is the ice queen.
[1:46:34.080 --> 1:46:35.080]  They're going crazy.
[1:46:35.080 --> 1:46:36.080]  They load.
[1:46:36.080 --> 1:46:37.080]  They detest.
[1:46:37.080 --> 1:46:38.080]  They're her.
[1:46:38.080 --> 1:46:39.080]  She is there.
[1:46:39.080 --> 1:46:45.480]  The new princess is Brigitte Nielsen wannabe, this doppelganger, the ice queen who has the
[1:46:45.480 --> 1:46:51.040]  personality spectrum from A to B. And this is a woman who comes along and she says, I'm
[1:46:51.040 --> 1:46:52.040]  going to do this.
[1:46:52.040 --> 1:46:57.400]  Now she's handed Trump, Trump, post that blood comment.
[1:46:57.400 --> 1:46:58.400]  Okay.
[1:46:58.400 --> 1:47:02.600]  And by the way, this, this may be more emblematic of her career after this than anything else.
[1:47:02.600 --> 1:47:05.600]  But anyway, so she is now handed Trump.
[1:47:05.600 --> 1:47:10.040]  Who in the right mind could have possibly have lost with the president to be of the United
[1:47:10.040 --> 1:47:11.040]  States?
[1:47:11.040 --> 1:47:12.040]  What happens?
[1:47:12.040 --> 1:47:15.840]  She loses to some age old rerun on 60 minutes.
[1:47:15.840 --> 1:47:16.840]  Fine.
[1:47:16.840 --> 1:47:17.840]  Strike two now.
[1:47:17.840 --> 1:47:19.160]  She goes to Putin.
[1:47:19.160 --> 1:47:23.960]  Who in the right mind cannot win with an interview with Putin?
[1:47:23.960 --> 1:47:24.960]  Who?
[1:47:24.960 --> 1:47:29.760]  A baby could go and win number one, not Megan Kelly.
[1:47:29.760 --> 1:47:34.120]  She sucks the oxygen out of the air and she basically loses.
[1:47:34.120 --> 1:47:36.320]  Now she comes up with you.
[1:47:36.320 --> 1:47:42.960]  What is the most amazing to all of us first, I've got to say something and you mentioned
[1:47:42.960 --> 1:47:43.960]  this before.
[1:47:43.960 --> 1:47:46.680]  How about that lighting Darth Vader?
[1:47:46.680 --> 1:47:48.680]  How about that Beelzebub lighting?
[1:47:48.680 --> 1:47:50.400]  What were they trying to do with that?
[1:47:50.400 --> 1:47:54.320]  Why don't you have had spooky music as a third, you know, the background?
[1:47:54.320 --> 1:47:59.240]  Why don't we just Alex Jones, don't don't don't, with a light coming this way?
[1:47:59.240 --> 1:48:02.080]  Oh, I mean, are you kidding me now?
[1:48:02.080 --> 1:48:03.080]  What she should have done.
[1:48:03.080 --> 1:48:07.480]  So this is the most important is she really wanted to catch you.
[1:48:07.480 --> 1:48:12.440]  And if you heard your your answer, this had to have been edited.
[1:48:12.440 --> 1:48:13.440]  Was it not sir?
[1:48:13.440 --> 1:48:19.840]  Because nobody speaks this this with with such an obvious lack of congruity.
[1:48:19.840 --> 1:48:23.880]  It didn't make any sense because absolutely she she was on him.
[1:48:23.880 --> 1:48:29.160]  You know, this is a prosecutor and she was a former lawyer and did a lot of cross examinations.
[1:48:29.160 --> 1:48:31.120]  And my mistake was saying, sure, come here all day.
[1:48:31.120 --> 1:48:34.120]  They were here 930 until almost 11 at night.
[1:48:34.120 --> 1:48:37.560]  She was here from 12 until almost midnight.
[1:48:37.560 --> 1:48:41.160]  She interviewed me three times for approximately four hours total.
[1:48:41.160 --> 1:48:46.160]  And by the third interview that was almost two hours long, she spent 30 minutes on Sandy
[1:48:46.160 --> 1:48:47.600]  hug.
[1:48:47.600 --> 1:48:49.880]  And so I would say, what do you mean?
[1:48:49.880 --> 1:48:52.880]  Of course I question they line about WMD's.
[1:48:52.880 --> 1:48:55.240]  And you know, then they didn't care when a half million kids died.
[1:48:55.240 --> 1:48:56.880]  And she goes, oh, that's a dodge.
[1:48:56.880 --> 1:48:58.440]  So they cut things out.
[1:48:58.440 --> 1:48:59.440]  So it's in congruent.
[1:48:59.440 --> 1:49:02.400]  I'm saying, listen, lady, I didn't change my story.
[1:49:02.400 --> 1:49:04.280]  I said it could be completely staged.
[1:49:04.280 --> 1:49:05.280]  It could be actors.
[1:49:05.280 --> 1:49:06.840]  It could be completely real.
[1:49:06.840 --> 1:49:08.200]  I've been saying that since day one.
[1:49:08.200 --> 1:49:10.480]  I was doing debates and devils advocate.
[1:49:10.480 --> 1:49:14.080]  I've been saying since the beginning, it was probably real.
[1:49:14.080 --> 1:49:18.280]  They took it out of context and then she just has something about I made all these statements
[1:49:18.280 --> 1:49:20.560]  before the media got concerned about it.
[1:49:20.560 --> 1:49:23.000]  It just sounds like I'm saying incoherent crap.
[1:49:23.000 --> 1:49:26.800]  And that's why I'm mad at her and it's why I want the piece to be canceled because she's
[1:49:26.800 --> 1:49:31.040]  clearly done a Katie Couric here and totally scrambled the interview.
[1:49:31.040 --> 1:49:35.400]  Now, what I would have done, and I'm sure you did is I would have told Megan Kelly.
[1:49:35.400 --> 1:49:40.200]  Now, you do understand that whereas you have limitations of time, I don't.
[1:49:40.200 --> 1:49:43.040]  I've got a camera here recording all of this.
[1:49:43.040 --> 1:49:44.240]  You know, this is what happened.
[1:49:44.240 --> 1:49:45.240]  They didn't want us to tape it.
[1:49:45.240 --> 1:49:46.400]  They didn't want us to have a camera.
[1:49:46.400 --> 1:49:47.400]  I said we wouldn't.
[1:49:47.400 --> 1:49:48.520]  I'm a man of my word.
[1:49:48.520 --> 1:49:50.960]  But some of the guys that came along did did tape it.
[1:49:50.960 --> 1:49:51.960]  We can boost the audio.
[1:49:51.960 --> 1:49:55.920]  And I did take my phone call with her when she was saying, oh, it's not a hit piece.
[1:49:55.920 --> 1:49:56.920]  I promise.
[1:49:56.920 --> 1:49:57.920]  We're not going to get into all this.
[1:49:57.920 --> 1:49:58.920]  I've got it on tape.
[1:49:58.920 --> 1:50:00.920]  I've got her lying to me.
[1:50:00.920 --> 1:50:02.600]  Alex, what does that tell you?
[1:50:02.600 --> 1:50:06.440]  How many times when you do an interview, you say I'm bringing my own recorder and they
[1:50:06.440 --> 1:50:08.640]  always say, well, of course, do that.
[1:50:08.640 --> 1:50:15.480]  May I suggest how I would have tried to catch somebody if I think somebody really is a nut,
[1:50:15.480 --> 1:50:19.840]  which I do not think right now, but if I did, do you know what I would have done?
[1:50:19.840 --> 1:50:20.840]  You know how I would have done it.
[1:50:20.840 --> 1:50:23.760]  I would have realized, first of all, that I'm not going to catch you by going after
[1:50:23.760 --> 1:50:26.080]  a particular fact because you know these facts.
[1:50:26.080 --> 1:50:27.080]  You know more facts than I.
[1:50:27.080 --> 1:50:30.560]  In fact, all you had to do was say, you know, maybe there's already a particular aspect
[1:50:30.560 --> 1:50:33.160]  of what I said in the past to have a problem with.
[1:50:33.160 --> 1:50:35.520]  But listen, I'll be honest, they were smart to get me all day.
[1:50:35.520 --> 1:50:36.640]  They knew they got me when I was tired.
[1:50:36.640 --> 1:50:38.840]  I didn't even do the best job, but it doesn't matter.
[1:50:38.840 --> 1:50:39.840]  They're editing all together.
[1:50:39.840 --> 1:50:41.840]  So tell me as a prosecutor what you would have done.
[1:50:41.840 --> 1:50:45.680]  I should have just been like Putin and given short answers and said, that's it.
[1:50:45.680 --> 1:50:46.680]  But this is nuanced stuff.
[1:50:46.680 --> 1:50:51.040]  And I knew they'd take out of context other clips of things I'd said.
[1:50:51.040 --> 1:50:55.240]  So I was really trying to give them an honest answer if she then butchers that and edits
[1:50:55.240 --> 1:50:56.240]  that.
[1:50:56.240 --> 1:50:57.240]  That's her problem.
[1:50:57.240 --> 1:50:58.240]  Lionel, with Lionel Media straight ahead.
[1:50:58.240 --> 1:50:59.240]  Stay with us.
[1:50:59.240 --> 1:51:04.440]  It's been said, any society is only three missed meals away from chaos.
[1:51:04.440 --> 1:51:06.000]  Those times may be near.
[1:51:06.000 --> 1:51:07.000]  Think about it.
[1:51:07.000 --> 1:51:11.680]  Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[1:51:11.680 --> 1:51:16.440]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[1:51:16.440 --> 1:51:20.280]  And our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages
[1:51:20.280 --> 1:51:22.320]  from a single cyber attack.
[1:51:22.320 --> 1:51:26.480]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide
[1:51:26.480 --> 1:51:29.080]  during a widespread national emergency.
[1:51:29.080 --> 1:51:32.080]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.
[1:51:32.080 --> 1:51:34.800]  That's where my Patriot supply comes in.

[1:51:59.360 --> 1:52:03.720]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[1:52:03.720 --> 1:52:08.400]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[1:52:08.400 --> 1:52:09.920]  to detoxify the body.
[1:52:09.920 --> 1:52:14.760]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[1:52:14.760 --> 1:52:16.280]  It's made in the USA.
[1:52:16.280 --> 1:52:21.200]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[1:52:21.200 --> 1:52:23.040]  the body and it supports the info war.
[1:52:23.040 --> 1:52:25.280]  It is a classical 360 win.
[1:52:25.280 --> 1:52:29.760]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe
[1:52:29.760 --> 1:52:34.560]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[1:52:34.560 --> 1:52:35.560]  get.
[1:52:35.560 --> 1:52:38.600]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this
[1:52:38.600 --> 1:52:43.600]  country and the world that Patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[1:52:43.600 --> 1:52:48.760]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[1:52:48.760 --> 1:52:51.440]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[1:52:51.440 --> 1:52:54.760]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[1:52:54.760 --> 1:52:58.800]  Now it's time to change our bodies with ZShield and FullWarsLife.com.
[1:52:58.800 --> 1:53:02.600]  Be prepared for the next disaster with the Shelter Pod.
[1:53:02.600 --> 1:53:06.640]  The Shelter Pod is a large all season heavy duty quick deploy shelter.
[1:53:06.640 --> 1:53:11.120]  The Shelter Pod system can be set up in 30 seconds and includes an emergency medical
[1:53:11.120 --> 1:53:14.240]  kit, water filter, survival tools and more.
[1:53:14.240 --> 1:53:16.080]  Are you prepared to take care of your family?
[1:53:16.080 --> 1:53:19.000]  Do you have everything in one place ready to go?
[1:53:19.000 --> 1:53:23.280]  Get it now or enter to win a complete Shelter Pod system at ShelterPod.com.
[1:53:23.280 --> 1:53:26.040]  The Shelter Pod at Shelter Pod.com.
[1:53:26.040 --> 1:53:28.600]  Shelter when you need it most.
[1:53:28.600 --> 1:53:29.600]  It's a no brainer.
[1:53:29.600 --> 1:53:31.840]  A big burky water filter is the one you need, period.
[1:53:31.840 --> 1:53:35.880]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other
[1:53:35.880 --> 1:53:39.880]  endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?
[1:53:39.880 --> 1:53:41.840]  It does it all at only 2 cents per gallon.
[1:53:41.840 --> 1:53:45.480]  Get the original most trusted name in gravity water filtration, Big Burky.
[1:53:45.480 --> 1:53:50.160]  And now GCN listeners receive 5% off ceramic filter systems using code GCN.
[1:53:50.160 --> 1:53:54.600]  Call or click 1-877-99-Burky or bigburkywaterfilters.com.
[1:53:54.600 --> 1:54:12.640]  That's 1-877-99-B-E-R-K-E-Y.
[1:54:12.640 --> 1:54:24.200]  You know folks, I don't put a good face on things unless there's really a good face
[1:54:24.200 --> 1:54:25.200]  on it.
[1:54:25.200 --> 1:54:30.360]  And the weak minded out there, they're going to see me getting attacked, they're going
[1:54:30.360 --> 1:54:34.240]  to see me getting demonized everywhere at war level propaganda.
[1:54:34.240 --> 1:54:37.960]  I mean you see this level of brainwashing before they launch an illegal war.
[1:54:37.960 --> 1:54:39.920]  I mean this is war level.
[1:54:39.920 --> 1:54:40.920]  It's war against Trump.
[1:54:40.920 --> 1:54:43.080]  It's war against the new independent media.
[1:54:43.080 --> 1:54:47.120]  And it's a war against the public to think, hey, this is Prasada Nangrata.
[1:54:47.120 --> 1:54:51.800]  And it's a very big miscalculation because everybody knows MSM lies, everybody knows
[1:54:51.800 --> 1:54:55.880]  they deceive, and the majority of people are then going to ask themselves, why are they
[1:54:55.880 --> 1:54:57.920]  demonizing this guy so much?
[1:54:57.920 --> 1:55:03.200]  It's a major miscalculation unless they're preparing to kill Trump and then try to shut
[1:55:03.200 --> 1:55:04.280]  the press down.
[1:55:04.280 --> 1:55:08.720]  And I talked to several people high level, formerly, which there's never any formerly,
[1:55:08.720 --> 1:55:13.200]  high level state department, high level CIA, high level Pentagon.
[1:55:13.200 --> 1:55:17.040]  And they said the word is the preparations are being made to kill the president.
[1:55:17.040 --> 1:55:20.440]  So Lionel's a smart prosecutor, big national media pundit.
[1:55:20.440 --> 1:55:22.400]  He says it makes no sense.
[1:55:22.400 --> 1:55:26.680]  Nobody who's smart says it makes sense unless they're going for broke.
[1:55:26.680 --> 1:55:28.400]  They thought Hillary was going to win too, folks.
[1:55:28.400 --> 1:55:31.000]  They lost because they ran a corpse.
[1:55:31.000 --> 1:55:33.560]  I mean I wasn't all behind Trump even early on either.
[1:55:33.560 --> 1:55:34.960]  Now he's done a lot of good stuff.
[1:55:34.960 --> 1:55:38.720]  You got to admire his courage, but asking Lionel what he would have done with Kelly,
[1:55:38.720 --> 1:55:39.720]  separate from that.
[1:55:39.720 --> 1:55:41.240]  We'll come in the next segment and get into that with him.
[1:55:41.240 --> 1:55:44.440]  Maybe he'll ride shotgun a little bit with Roger Stone coming up.
[1:55:44.440 --> 1:55:47.040]  But this is biblical.
[1:55:47.040 --> 1:55:48.040]  This is so epic.
[1:55:48.040 --> 1:55:49.440]  I'm not on a power trip.
[1:55:49.440 --> 1:55:55.040]  I'm actually at a core level not enjoying this, but as a man wanting to make history
[1:55:55.040 --> 1:55:57.280]  and fight evil, I'm very proud.
[1:55:57.280 --> 1:55:59.120]  My spirit tells me I've done a good job.
[1:55:59.120 --> 1:56:02.120]  My flesh is like, dude, you're really asking for it.
[1:56:02.120 --> 1:56:06.640]  These are dangerous killers that overthrow countries and put women into mass sex slavery
[1:56:06.640 --> 1:56:07.640]  for jihadists.
[1:56:07.640 --> 1:56:09.000]  That's what Hillary did.
[1:56:09.000 --> 1:56:13.240]  They rob hundreds of thousands of Haitians and tens of thousands die, and it's in their
[1:56:13.240 --> 1:56:14.240]  own WikiLeaks.
[1:56:14.240 --> 1:56:15.240]  They don't care.
[1:56:15.240 --> 1:56:18.960]  They'll give little kids cholera water, Chelsea Clinton's a monster.
[1:56:18.960 --> 1:56:23.400]  So I don't have fun going up against these killers, but somebody's got to, and I think
[1:56:23.400 --> 1:56:27.680]  it shows how weak they are that they've got to engage in this whole thing.
[1:56:27.680 --> 1:56:29.440]  What do you think's really behind this, Lionel?
[1:56:29.440 --> 1:56:34.160]  Well, first of all, it's desperation because she thought it would be a good idea to bring
[1:56:34.160 --> 1:56:39.040]  you in under some strange theory that somehow her ladies would be boosted.
[1:56:39.040 --> 1:56:40.040]  Look, let me tell you something.
[1:56:40.040 --> 1:56:43.760]  I've known you for a while, my friend, and I'm detecting in your voice a little bit of
[1:56:43.760 --> 1:56:46.320]  a, a little bit of a, gee, I shouldn't have done this.
[1:56:46.320 --> 1:56:47.320]  You were brilliant.
[1:56:47.320 --> 1:56:48.920]  Don't you understand something?
[1:56:48.920 --> 1:56:49.920]  You can't lose.
[1:56:49.920 --> 1:56:52.440]  It doesn't matter what they say.
[1:56:52.440 --> 1:56:56.680]  You would just expose to an audience that would have never heard you.
[1:56:56.680 --> 1:56:57.680]  She loses.
[1:56:57.680 --> 1:57:02.120]  She's losing the advertising, not you, because you don't need advertising.
[1:57:02.120 --> 1:57:06.560]  She's the one who went on and basically had the hottest person to destroy who poses the
[1:57:06.560 --> 1:57:08.800]  first existential threat to legacy media.
[1:57:08.800 --> 1:57:12.680]  And instead of her doing it the right way, she basically cobbled this thing together.
[1:57:12.680 --> 1:57:13.680]  It does not matter.
[1:57:13.680 --> 1:57:20.160]  And what happens, the irony of this, the weird karma, she's losing, guess what?
[1:57:20.160 --> 1:57:23.440]  Losing the advertising and you're stronger.
[1:57:23.440 --> 1:57:25.560]  Everybody knows your name today.
[1:57:25.560 --> 1:57:26.560]  Everybody knows it.
[1:57:26.560 --> 1:57:32.000]  Now, one of the things you have to, to grasp, Alex, is that what she did was, by virtue
[1:57:32.000 --> 1:57:38.680]  of her cobbling this thing into this weird patchwork, all you have to do out of the first
[1:57:38.680 --> 1:57:43.880]  thing out of your mouth is tell the world, that's not what I said, that's not what I
[1:57:43.880 --> 1:57:44.880]  said.
[1:57:44.880 --> 1:57:45.880]  They edited it.
[1:57:45.880 --> 1:57:46.880]  Do you know they stole my words?
[1:57:46.880 --> 1:57:48.600]  And that's the first thing I said.
[1:57:48.600 --> 1:57:52.320]  And then I should have just shut up at that point because she kept asking, kept asking.
[1:57:52.320 --> 1:57:54.640]  So I was trying to be honest, answering it.
[1:57:54.640 --> 1:57:56.040]  And so she just edited it together.
[1:57:56.040 --> 1:57:57.040]  But that's her fault.
[1:57:57.040 --> 1:57:58.040]  That's her problem.
[1:57:58.040 --> 1:57:59.520]  She's not going to be here.
[1:57:59.520 --> 1:58:00.520]  Don't you understand?
[1:58:00.520 --> 1:58:01.520]  She's not going to be here.
[1:58:01.520 --> 1:58:04.400]  Like I said before, she had Trump hooting now you.
[1:58:04.400 --> 1:58:09.600]  Her ratings, by the way, if she's still around, are going to be through the roof by virtue
[1:58:09.600 --> 1:58:10.600]  of all of this.
[1:58:10.600 --> 1:58:15.120]  Look, they may not, they may not be, uh, distorted people, but they're not crazy.
[1:58:15.120 --> 1:58:16.120]  You watch how it's milked.
[1:58:16.120 --> 1:58:17.120]  Now I want to.
[1:58:17.120 --> 1:58:18.120]  No, no, I understand.
[1:58:18.120 --> 1:58:20.440]  But let me ask you this when we come back at 70 seconds then.
[1:58:20.440 --> 1:58:21.920]  Will they air it Sunday?
[1:58:21.920 --> 1:58:23.560]  Because, because then I clicked.
[1:58:23.560 --> 1:58:29.520]  The reason I say don't air it is they edited me to misrepresent and I realized it's father's
[1:58:29.520 --> 1:58:30.520]  day.
[1:58:30.520 --> 1:58:32.120]  They're all saying I did this on father's day.
[1:58:32.120 --> 1:58:33.600]  No, they rigged all this.
[1:58:33.600 --> 1:58:35.400]  I didn't think of this.
[1:58:35.400 --> 1:58:36.400]  They're the ones.
[1:58:36.400 --> 1:58:37.400]  This is so nasty.
[1:58:37.400 --> 1:58:38.400]  We're going to come right back.
[1:58:38.400 --> 1:58:43.400]  I should have looked at the date, but they didn't tell me what was going to air.
[1:58:43.400 --> 1:58:44.880]  Now these people are evil.
[1:58:44.880 --> 1:58:50.280]  Hey guys, pull me the Super Bowl stuff where they run the ads against fathers.
[1:58:50.280 --> 1:58:56.760]  Senator Rand Paul slammed the Democrats yesterday and called the Senate hearings into the collusion
[1:58:56.760 --> 1:59:03.720]  between Trump and Russia nothing more than political theater appearing on CNN.
[1:59:03.720 --> 1:59:10.280]  Rand Paul said that the anti-Trumpers have become totally obsessed with proving a Russian
[1:59:10.280 --> 1:59:13.480]  conspiracy that simply does not exist.
[1:59:13.480 --> 1:59:17.920]  This is political theater and really those committees aren't getting anywhere.
[1:59:17.920 --> 1:59:22.880]  If there really was anything done wrong, it'll come out of the special counsel and my suspicion
[1:59:22.880 --> 1:59:24.760]  is very little of anything will come out of there.
[1:59:24.760 --> 1:59:28.320]  But I think there's a political operation going on.
[1:59:28.320 --> 1:59:35.040]  Rand Paul went on to say that former FBI Chief James Comey's testimony completely vindicated
[1:59:35.040 --> 1:59:38.320]  everything the president has already said.
[1:59:38.320 --> 1:59:39.320]  I hardly know the man.
[1:59:39.320 --> 1:59:41.520]  I'm not going to say I want you to pledge allegiance.
[1:59:41.520 --> 1:59:42.520]  Who would do that?
[1:59:42.520 --> 1:59:45.560]  Who would ask a man to pledge allegiance under oath?
[1:59:45.560 --> 1:59:52.200]  You can learn more right now at infowars.com.
[1:59:52.200 --> 1:59:59.200]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:59:59.200 --> 2:00:09.560]  News, analysis, reports, it's the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:09.560 --> 2:00:15.240]  All right, Lionel's our guest right in the shotgun in the next segment with Roger Stone
[2:00:15.240 --> 2:00:16.760]  with us.
[2:00:16.760 --> 2:00:20.160]  Lionelmedia.com, Alex Jones with infowars.com.
[2:00:20.160 --> 2:00:22.960]  Now, I'm not saying let's put a good face on him.
[2:00:22.960 --> 2:00:27.760]  For this time in the summer, we have the highest ratings we've ever had.
[2:00:27.760 --> 2:00:30.720]  We have the highest amount of listeners we've had since the election.
[2:00:30.720 --> 2:00:33.740]  We have the highest amount of advertisers knocking down our doors.
[2:00:33.740 --> 2:00:37.120]  We have the highest amount we've ever had in the summer, which is normally dead of people
[2:00:37.120 --> 2:00:40.160]  buying products to the point of we're selling out a bunch of them.
[2:00:40.160 --> 2:00:42.040]  Meanwhile, Megyn Kelly's losing sponsors.
[2:00:42.040 --> 2:00:43.040]  It's all falling apart.
[2:00:43.040 --> 2:00:44.040]  But Lionel's right.
[2:00:44.040 --> 2:00:46.560]  They'll get high ratings like Pierce Morgan had when I was on.
[2:00:46.560 --> 2:00:47.560]  I'm not bragging.
[2:00:47.560 --> 2:00:48.560]  I don't know why this happens.
[2:00:48.560 --> 2:00:52.400]  This is explosive to bring two forces together like in a chemistry set.
[2:00:52.400 --> 2:00:56.680]  But I predict this will bring her down in the end because she was already sinking like
[2:00:56.680 --> 2:00:57.680]  a stone.
[2:00:57.680 --> 2:00:58.920]  This is a desperation move.
[2:00:58.920 --> 2:01:04.040]  So when I say Megyn Kelly needs the Patriot movement to tune in, that's the truth.
[2:01:04.040 --> 2:01:05.280]  It isn't me.
[2:01:05.280 --> 2:01:06.280]  It's Lionel.
[2:01:06.280 --> 2:01:09.920]  It's all the guests that we, it's the Ron Pauls we have on.
[2:01:09.920 --> 2:01:12.040]  It's all the news they don't want you to see.
[2:01:12.040 --> 2:01:15.320]  Remember when that Google document came out three months ago that Cernovich got her two
[2:01:15.320 --> 2:01:20.440]  months ago, it said he had Ron Paul on saying the chemical attack was a false flag.
[2:01:20.440 --> 2:01:21.440]  That's not credible.
[2:01:21.440 --> 2:01:27.040]  Well, Ron Paul was quoting the UN and the Pentagon, but it's totally credible.
[2:01:27.040 --> 2:01:29.560]  It's because we are credible that they don't like it.
[2:01:29.560 --> 2:01:30.560]  They want it shut down.
[2:01:30.560 --> 2:01:34.320]  So when they want to censor Alex, they want to censor you Lionel, what's really behind
[2:01:34.320 --> 2:01:35.320]  this?
[2:01:35.320 --> 2:01:38.040]  Well, let me go back to this again.
[2:01:38.040 --> 2:01:39.320]  They are dying.
[2:01:39.320 --> 2:01:44.680]  You don't understand what is going on in the background at NBC with Andy Lack and others
[2:01:44.680 --> 2:01:50.400]  because she has been a complete and total cosmic gravitational failure and people who
[2:01:50.400 --> 2:01:51.400]  want her to fail.
[2:01:51.400 --> 2:01:53.560]  Do you know how many people she's alienated?
[2:01:53.560 --> 2:01:55.960]  Do you know what she did to the Today Show?
[2:01:55.960 --> 2:01:58.440]  I know that's kind of inside baseball, so to speak.
[2:01:58.440 --> 2:02:01.480]  Well, listen, let me explain some of you.
[2:02:01.480 --> 2:02:08.600]  Nobody has any idea of the power of not only you, but your movement and what this is saying.
[2:02:08.600 --> 2:02:10.040]  Nobody understands that.
[2:02:10.040 --> 2:02:13.040]  Now, another thing to it, let me just also bring up.
[2:02:13.040 --> 2:02:19.160]  If you wanted to catch you, because believe it or not, it would have been better had she
[2:02:19.160 --> 2:02:21.200]  done what I suggested.
[2:02:21.200 --> 2:02:23.160]  Let her just ask you to speak.
[2:02:23.160 --> 2:02:29.000]  Alex, if you ever are dealing with somebody who is, if you truly believe they're crazy
[2:02:29.000 --> 2:02:33.560]  and dangerous and out of their mind, you let them talk.
[2:02:33.560 --> 2:02:36.840]  You almost give them the fake sense that you admire them.
[2:02:36.840 --> 2:02:41.800]  I would have done something like providing you with somebody else, Mr. Jones.
[2:02:41.800 --> 2:02:45.920]  Tell me what it feels like to be the leader of a revolution.
[2:02:45.920 --> 2:02:46.920]  Tell me.
[2:02:46.920 --> 2:02:48.520]  I would have known your catchphrases.
[2:02:48.520 --> 2:02:50.960]  I would have lowered your guard.
[2:02:50.960 --> 2:02:52.600]  I would have brought out.
[2:02:52.600 --> 2:02:54.520]  It's just like hostage negotiation.
[2:02:54.520 --> 2:02:57.440]  You tell somebody, I understand your plight.
[2:02:57.440 --> 2:02:58.440]  I understand.
[2:02:58.440 --> 2:02:59.440]  They don't respect you.
[2:02:59.440 --> 2:03:02.760]  Then I would have said, folks, run the camera.
[2:03:02.760 --> 2:03:03.760]  Let it go.
[2:03:03.760 --> 2:03:10.760]  But what she did was, because you knew these answers, because you never said anything that
[2:03:10.760 --> 2:03:12.720]  she thought you said.
[2:03:12.720 --> 2:03:16.920]  Because you merely brought up things which she's never, ever thought of before, basically
[2:03:16.920 --> 2:03:18.920]  that you have questions and others.
[2:03:18.920 --> 2:03:23.320]  Again, I ask anybody to watch that original trailer, Alex.
[2:03:23.320 --> 2:03:24.560]  It's incongruous.
[2:03:24.560 --> 2:03:29.640]  It doesn't make any sense what she asked specifically about Sandy Hook.
[2:03:29.640 --> 2:03:34.440]  Your answer, if you listen to it, I'm thinking to myself, did Alex not understand this?
[2:03:34.440 --> 2:03:36.400]  No, that's not what you said.
[2:03:36.400 --> 2:03:41.080]  Alex, we live in a world right now where we hate the notion of plagiarism, and there's
[2:03:41.080 --> 2:03:44.200]  an old expression that says, if you steal from one, it's plagiarism.
[2:03:44.200 --> 2:03:46.440]  If you steal from a bunch, it's called research.
[2:03:46.440 --> 2:03:48.520]  But you know what's worse than plagiarism?
[2:03:48.520 --> 2:03:50.400]  What's worse than taking somebody's idea?
[2:03:50.400 --> 2:03:57.080]  It's taking somebody's idea and removing it, making it synthetic, making it false.
[2:03:57.080 --> 2:03:59.080]  Building a straw man.
[2:03:59.080 --> 2:04:00.080]  Precisely.
[2:04:00.080 --> 2:04:04.280]  So what she did was, you can say, how dare you?
[2:04:04.280 --> 2:04:06.680]  This is Ms. Kelly, Ms. Megan.
[2:04:06.680 --> 2:04:09.040]  I knew you were going to do a hatchet job of me.
[2:04:09.040 --> 2:04:10.680]  I understood that.
[2:04:10.680 --> 2:04:12.480]  But I must have been naive.
[2:04:12.480 --> 2:04:19.360]  I would have thought you and this august organization known as NBC would have had the common decency
[2:04:19.360 --> 2:04:25.400]  to let me merely say what I wanted to say, not to expurgate and boldly rise.
[2:04:25.400 --> 2:04:26.400]  So let me ask this.
[2:04:26.400 --> 2:04:27.400]  We're going to come back.
[2:04:27.400 --> 2:04:28.400]  Roger Stone's got big breaking news.
[2:04:28.400 --> 2:04:29.920]  I've got my own intel on coming.
[2:04:29.920 --> 2:04:30.920]  We'll talk about that.
[2:04:30.920 --> 2:04:37.240]  Do you think Kelly survives because, I don't mean to be mean, but she's aging rapidly,
[2:04:37.240 --> 2:04:42.320]  but she's such a cold person and people don't like her and her ratings are going down.
[2:04:42.320 --> 2:04:44.440]  This was the nail in the coffin.
[2:04:44.440 --> 2:04:47.600]  This precipitated that which was the inevitable.
[2:04:47.600 --> 2:04:49.280]  She wasn't working.
[2:04:49.280 --> 2:04:50.760]  Nobody at NBC wanted her.
[2:04:50.760 --> 2:04:51.760]  But not only that.
[2:04:51.760 --> 2:04:55.520]  And so now she's going to get big ratings, but it's like the death star blowing up.
[2:04:55.520 --> 2:04:56.520]  That's it.
[2:04:56.520 --> 2:04:57.520]  The last two raw.
[2:04:57.520 --> 2:04:58.520]  We'll be back.
[2:04:58.520 --> 2:05:06.800]  Senator Rand Paul slammed the Democrats yesterday and called the Senate hearings into the collusion
[2:05:06.800 --> 2:05:13.800]  between Trump and Russia, nothing more than political theater, appearing on CNN.
[2:05:13.800 --> 2:05:20.360]  Rand Paul said that the anti-Trumpers have become totally obsessed with proving a Russian
[2:05:20.360 --> 2:05:24.160]  conspiracy that simply does not exist.
[2:05:24.160 --> 2:05:28.040]  This is political theater and really those committees aren't getting anywhere.
[2:05:28.040 --> 2:05:32.920]  If there really was anything done wrong, it'll come out of the special counsel and my suspicion
[2:05:32.920 --> 2:05:34.920]  is very little of anything will come out of there.
[2:05:34.920 --> 2:05:38.320]  But I think there's a political operation going on.
[2:05:38.320 --> 2:05:45.080]  Rand Paul went on to say that former FBI Chief James Comey's testimony completely vindicated
[2:05:45.080 --> 2:05:48.320]  everything the president has already said.
[2:05:48.320 --> 2:05:49.320]  I hardly know the man.
[2:05:49.320 --> 2:05:51.320]  I'm not going to say I want you to pledge allegiance.
[2:05:51.320 --> 2:05:52.320]  Who would do that?
[2:05:52.320 --> 2:05:55.600]  Who would ask a man to pledge allegiance under oath?
[2:05:55.600 --> 2:05:57.120]  You can learn more right now.
[2:05:57.120 --> 2:05:58.120]  At Infowars.com.
[2:05:58.120 --> 2:06:01.600]  Imbricks Essentials, that's my middle name.
[2:06:01.600 --> 2:06:07.920]  I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already
[2:06:07.920 --> 2:06:13.240]  trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic
[2:06:13.240 --> 2:06:14.240]  and high quality.
[2:06:14.240 --> 2:06:20.480]  This is one of the top three selling organic brands in the country that puts out high quality
[2:06:20.480 --> 2:06:23.440]  organic shampoo, mouthwash, you name it.
[2:06:23.440 --> 2:06:27.920]  If they're such patriots, they have let us basically keep their well-known packaging.
[2:06:27.920 --> 2:06:31.880]  It is an answer to prayer and because we're cutting out the middleman, 20% off retail,
[2:06:31.880 --> 2:06:35.120]  sign a ferrato ship, an additional 25% off.
[2:06:35.120 --> 2:06:39.800]  It's all there, the body wash, the shampoo, the deodorant, the mouthwash.
[2:06:39.800 --> 2:06:41.640]  All of it is truly game changing.
[2:06:41.640 --> 2:06:46.200]  It is the exact same product, just the name is different, Imbricks Essentials and it's
[2:06:46.200 --> 2:06:52.520]  on average 20% off what it would be in stores buying it directly from InfowarsStore.com.

[2:06:59.040 --> 2:07:02.760]  After being sold out for months, our best selling Super Blue Floral Eye Toothpaste is
[2:07:02.760 --> 2:07:07.040]  now back in stock at InfowarsStore.com, the first shipment of Super Blue sold out in
[2:07:07.040 --> 2:07:08.040]  one week.
[2:07:08.040 --> 2:07:11.080]  I thought it would be a six month supply for listeners and since then people are beating
[2:07:11.080 --> 2:07:15.200]  down our doors wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[2:07:15.200 --> 2:07:18.280]  Research across the board is clear, in fact it's certified.
[2:07:18.280 --> 2:07:21.920]  When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and if you contribute to
[2:07:21.920 --> 2:07:25.880]  blood clots and heart attacks, that's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral
[2:07:25.880 --> 2:07:30.400]  health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[2:07:30.400 --> 2:07:34.600]  Super Blue Floral Eye Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula, it's loaded with good halogen
[2:07:34.600 --> 2:07:37.160]  iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[2:07:37.160 --> 2:07:41.520]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since Biblical times to help wipe out
[2:07:41.520 --> 2:07:43.960]  bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[2:07:43.960 --> 2:07:48.360]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue, chosen by our dental experts include xylitol,
[2:07:48.360 --> 2:07:51.480]  peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more.

[2:08:09.600 --> 2:08:26.960]  Alex Jones, The Cure To Fake News, coming to you live from Austin, Texas.
[2:08:26.960 --> 2:08:34.360]  Alright, Roger Stone, former head of the Trump campaign and Lionel are now joining us.
[2:08:34.360 --> 2:08:38.720]  Lionel's already been on, we're going to go to Roger first and come back with Lionel.
[2:08:38.720 --> 2:08:40.880]  I don't like to sit here and talk about myself.
[2:08:40.880 --> 2:08:45.920]  I get attacked in probably, let's not exaggerate, couple hundred newspapers today because I get
[2:08:45.920 --> 2:08:50.160]  Google alerts, on average about a hundred, two hundred.
[2:08:50.160 --> 2:08:55.640]  And I get attacked pretty much every day on ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, one of those channels.
[2:08:55.640 --> 2:09:00.840]  Today I'm being attacked every 15, 20 minutes, so every other segment.
[2:09:00.840 --> 2:09:04.560]  And it's all lies, it's all things I didn't say or edited together.
[2:09:04.560 --> 2:09:10.640]  I told Megyn Kelly, I believe that Newtown probably happened, but that if they lied it
[2:09:10.640 --> 2:09:15.920]  was constantly about WMDs and babies getting killed in incubators and all this other garbage
[2:09:15.920 --> 2:09:20.920]  and CNN and MSNBC just got caught staging fake newscast, I covered it earlier.
[2:09:20.920 --> 2:09:27.160]  It's on InfoWars.com with former Clinton campaign directors posing as random women on the street,
[2:09:27.160 --> 2:09:30.960]  you know, calling for Trump to be basically impeached.
[2:09:30.960 --> 2:09:32.440]  It's ridiculous.
[2:09:32.440 --> 2:09:36.840]  So of course we question known liars, then they turn it into this whole personal deal,
[2:09:36.840 --> 2:09:43.120]  but what do you do when, I mean, they're attacking Alex Jones more than Trump the last two days.
[2:09:43.120 --> 2:09:49.400]  It was the top story yesterday, it's the second trend today, and it is just unbelievable.
[2:09:49.400 --> 2:09:54.120]  Meanwhile, the reason we've got Roger Stone on, he's got his sources, I've got mine.
[2:09:54.120 --> 2:10:01.240]  My sources at the White House and in other areas say that, oh, it's all Democrats, Mueller,
[2:10:01.240 --> 2:10:06.880]  Democratic appointees, you know, the whole situation is a nightmare, and that they've
[2:10:06.880 --> 2:10:12.000]  got the same folks, you know, in there before who they've used and hatchet jobs, shock.
[2:10:12.000 --> 2:10:17.120]  Three members of Russian special counsel team donated the dims, one previously represented
[2:10:17.120 --> 2:10:23.440]  Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation, meanwhile, exclusive, and I'd heard this
[2:10:23.440 --> 2:10:26.280]  this morning, I didn't get a chance to call Roger to see if he knew about it.
[2:10:26.280 --> 2:10:31.400]  He told me some separate intel, DOJ brass says, Comey struck insider immunity deal with
[2:10:31.400 --> 2:10:36.480]  Mueller to avoid criminal charges, and you saw how arrogant Comey was about criminally
[2:10:36.480 --> 2:10:42.440]  leaking and not being worried about it, but the intel I've got, we'll see if Roger can
[2:10:42.440 --> 2:10:43.440]  confirm or deny this.
[2:10:43.440 --> 2:10:49.800]  He's always ahead of me for my other sources is that rents Prebus, who reportedly is going
[2:10:49.800 --> 2:10:56.880]  to be out July 4th, if he can't quote, grow up and stop leaking, leaked the information
[2:10:56.880 --> 2:11:03.120]  to a mutual friend of Roger and I and others that Trump was looking to go after Mueller,
[2:11:03.120 --> 2:11:05.720]  which I've learned from sources he wasn't.
[2:11:05.720 --> 2:11:11.320]  It was done to further hurt the president, damage him, but also kind of crippling so
[2:11:11.320 --> 2:11:16.320]  he doesn't have moral high standing to go after Mueller to kind of preemptively strike
[2:11:16.320 --> 2:11:17.320]  against that.
[2:11:17.320 --> 2:11:19.560]  Now I haven't talked to stone.
[2:11:19.560 --> 2:11:23.760]  When I got this info two hours ago, I started texting him saying, please get ahold of Nico.
[2:11:23.760 --> 2:11:26.160]  You know, I was driving in from picking my daughter to the dentist.
[2:11:26.160 --> 2:11:28.560]  So I just like I hadn't talked to Lionel before.
[2:11:28.560 --> 2:11:30.360]  I don't know Roger's analysis.
[2:11:30.360 --> 2:11:35.680]  We'll see if it concurs with what I've got Roger Stone of stone cold truth.com bestselling
[2:11:35.680 --> 2:11:38.200]  author of the making of the president 2016.
[2:11:38.200 --> 2:11:39.440]  I've laid it out.
[2:11:39.440 --> 2:11:40.440]  What's really going on?
[2:11:40.440 --> 2:11:46.440]  Well, first of all, Alex, let me congratulate you for having the second best progressed
[2:11:46.440 --> 2:11:52.920]  man and the face of the planet Lionel on review a great friend and always interesting and
[2:11:52.920 --> 2:11:54.720]  always incisive.
[2:11:54.720 --> 2:12:00.400]  I think what's happening here, Alex, is that we have to remember where Mr. Mueller came
[2:12:00.400 --> 2:12:01.600]  from.
[2:12:01.600 --> 2:12:06.960]  He was not appointed special counsel by Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
[2:12:06.960 --> 2:12:15.560]  He was appointed by Mr. Rosenstein, a deputy attorney general standing in because in this
[2:12:15.560 --> 2:12:19.760]  matter, the Attorney General has recused himself.
[2:12:19.760 --> 2:12:24.320]  And Mr. Mueller is a rock red member of the political establishment.
[2:12:24.320 --> 2:12:29.480]  He is a crony, perhaps even a mentor to Mr. Coney.
[2:12:29.480 --> 2:12:36.880]  We know that he met with and coached Mr. Coney on his testimony last week.
[2:12:36.880 --> 2:12:48.160]  We know that he has a history of a career two-party opportunism, having served both
[2:12:48.160 --> 2:12:56.760]  the Bushes and the Clintons as a deep state hitman who would do their bidding investigating
[2:12:56.760 --> 2:13:00.120]  some crimes and, of course, ignoring others.
[2:13:00.120 --> 2:13:11.840]  It is Mr. Coney who swept all of the FBI literature clear of any observations about Islamic terrorism,
[2:13:11.840 --> 2:13:16.520]  which I think has been to the detriment of law enforcement.
[2:13:16.520 --> 2:13:24.880]  And he cut the funding for prosecution of white collar crime, the type committed by
[2:13:24.880 --> 2:13:27.320]  globalists by almost half.
[2:13:27.320 --> 2:13:31.600]  I was about to say, I mean, it's just been a rain of white collar crimes since he got
[2:13:31.600 --> 2:13:32.600]  in.
[2:13:32.600 --> 2:13:42.280]  Well, and a greatly increasing funding to crack down on black people, poor people, and
[2:13:42.280 --> 2:13:47.400]  so on, like the rest of the war on drugs machinery.
[2:13:47.400 --> 2:13:56.160]  Mr. Mueller, in fact, actually auditioned essentially with the president for the open
[2:13:56.160 --> 2:14:04.280]  FBI position caused by the resignation, I should pardon me, by the firing of James
[2:14:04.280 --> 2:14:05.280]  Coney.
[2:14:05.280 --> 2:14:06.280]  Now, this is breaking.
[2:14:06.280 --> 2:14:08.760]  This is the other point that I got from one of my sources, and you're bringing it up on
[2:14:08.760 --> 2:14:14.320]  your own because that's what I'm hearing, that Coney, after he got fired, that the word
[2:14:14.320 --> 2:14:19.000]  was there was even debate or discussion, or at least he thought Mueller thought he might
[2:14:19.000 --> 2:14:21.440]  be brought back for another term?
[2:14:21.440 --> 2:14:29.640]  Well, unfortunately, as we have seen in the case, for example, of Dana B. Powell, Jared
[2:14:29.640 --> 2:14:35.480]  and Ivanka, the president's son-in-law and his beautiful daughter, have in many cases
[2:14:35.480 --> 2:14:43.640]  advocated the hiring appointments of neocons of people in the McMaster wing of the Trump
[2:14:43.640 --> 2:14:44.640]  White House.
[2:14:44.640 --> 2:14:51.720]  The McMaster actually goes to the Bilderberger conference, he is Johnny on the spot with
[2:14:51.720 --> 2:15:03.840]  an immediate plan for 150,000 fruits in Syria, right after allegedly Assad gasses his own
[2:15:03.840 --> 2:15:11.880]  people, having renounced any possession of chemical weapons, two years previously in
[2:15:11.880 --> 2:15:18.200]  agreement with the Obama administration, and with the insurances of his patrons, the Russians,
[2:15:18.200 --> 2:15:22.520]  who are vouching for him, and without whom he cannot survive.
[2:15:22.520 --> 2:15:27.440]  What about my sources saying that Kushner is losing power in the White House because
[2:15:27.440 --> 2:15:33.840]  he's the one that had assured Trump that if he just fired Flynn, everything would go
[2:15:33.840 --> 2:15:34.840]  away?
[2:15:34.840 --> 2:15:44.760]  Here are the facts, Jared Kushner should not be convicted in the court of public opinion,
[2:15:44.760 --> 2:15:51.680]  and the beating he has taken for allegedly opening a back channel to the Russians.
[2:15:51.680 --> 2:15:52.680]  That's totally normal.
[2:15:52.680 --> 2:16:02.560]  I think is entirely unfair, but that said, it is Mr. Kushner who urged the president
[2:16:02.560 --> 2:16:08.800]  to fire General Flynn, assuring him it would make the entire Russian collusion question
[2:16:08.800 --> 2:16:09.800]  go away.
[2:16:09.800 --> 2:16:10.800]  He was wrong.
[2:16:10.800 --> 2:16:14.440]  And I think it's clear the president regrets it.
[2:16:14.440 --> 2:16:17.040]  We're going to go back into more of this in a moment, I want to bring Lionel because
[2:16:17.040 --> 2:16:20.720]  he's a former big city prosecutor, not just a media analyst, into this.
[2:16:20.720 --> 2:16:23.120]  I'm not a rocket scientist legally.
[2:16:23.120 --> 2:16:27.000]  But if you see all the crimes of the Clintons, the illegal server, the thousands of emails
[2:16:27.000 --> 2:16:32.080]  caught lying, obstruction of justice, the Attorney General ordering him to not call
[2:16:32.080 --> 2:16:34.640]  an investigation, but a matter.
[2:16:34.640 --> 2:16:39.800]  Clearly there's like a mausoleum of skeletons in the Clinton and Obama's closet, and we're
[2:16:39.800 --> 2:16:44.520]  looking for dirt under the fingernails of any Trump associates, or am I wrong?
[2:16:44.520 --> 2:16:49.280]  Because this just looks like the most classic witch hunt since the Salem witch trials.
[2:16:49.280 --> 2:16:57.280]  You know, Alex, if I could, this is incredibly important and critical.
[2:16:57.280 --> 2:16:59.840]  But let me just take this a step back.
[2:16:59.840 --> 2:17:07.200]  If we went to Main Street, to the Heartland, if we went to any city in the country of the
[2:17:07.200 --> 2:17:12.280]  64 million roughly Americans who voted for Donald Trump, and you ask them, does anybody
[2:17:12.280 --> 2:17:14.840]  know the name Jared Kushner, Michael Flynn, Abandoned?
[2:17:14.840 --> 2:17:17.720]  Does anybody know about McMaster?
[2:17:17.720 --> 2:17:21.280]  Does anybody know about Comey versus Mueller versus, they would say, I don't know what the
[2:17:21.280 --> 2:17:23.240]  hell you're talking about.
[2:17:23.240 --> 2:17:29.240]  Because while this is important, and CNN is creating the illusion and the perception by
[2:17:29.240 --> 2:17:39.040]  saying investigation, hearing, just like they hit us with the meme of Russia, but to the
[2:17:39.040 --> 2:17:45.720]  average American, the person is going to be asked to vote again for President Trump.
[2:17:45.720 --> 2:17:50.040]  If you ask this person, does he do these names resonate with you?
[2:17:50.040 --> 2:17:51.040]  No, they don't.
[2:17:51.040 --> 2:17:53.040]  But Hillary does.
[2:17:53.040 --> 2:17:54.040]  Hillary does too.
[2:17:54.040 --> 2:17:58.960]  And also now watch the latest with Terry McCullough, because now he's going to be he and I'm sure
[2:17:58.960 --> 2:18:03.880]  Roger knows more about this than I do, but they're trying to not do a shift.
[2:18:03.880 --> 2:18:08.080]  Because remember, the Democratic Party has lost so much time, they should have been able
[2:18:08.080 --> 2:18:09.800]  to formulate a platform and a-
[2:18:09.800 --> 2:18:12.720]  So let me ask you this, that's my question to go back to Roger briefly, we're going
[2:18:12.720 --> 2:18:13.720]  to break.
[2:18:13.720 --> 2:18:14.960]  How is this going for the Democrats?
[2:18:14.960 --> 2:18:18.680]  Because my sources say, they're failing, but they don't care.
[2:18:18.680 --> 2:18:22.080]  They're now preparing and desensitizing for the assassination of Trump.
[2:18:22.080 --> 2:18:23.080]  Stone?
[2:18:23.080 --> 2:18:28.440]  But Alex, before we go there, let me continue, because I think it's important.
[2:18:28.440 --> 2:18:34.720]  How only did Mr. Kushner tell the president to fire General Flynn?
[2:18:34.720 --> 2:18:41.560]  He then told the president to fire Mr. Comey as a way of ending the Russian inquiry.
[2:18:41.560 --> 2:18:49.320]  Now he, the president in this narrative, the president has done both.
[2:18:49.320 --> 2:18:51.720]  I think he regrets them.
[2:18:51.720 --> 2:18:56.680]  Why is it Mr. Kushner driven to end this line of inquiry?
[2:18:56.680 --> 2:19:02.000]  I don't think there's any culpability or knowledge by the president, but it is believed
[2:19:02.000 --> 2:19:08.520]  that Mr. Kushner probably solicited both the Chinese and the Russians to bail him out in
[2:19:08.520 --> 2:19:12.800]  his 666, the state project.
[2:19:12.800 --> 2:19:18.200]  I don't believe any transaction ever came to fruition, but that would, and none of
[2:19:18.200 --> 2:19:23.360]  that would of course be a prime, but it would be deeply embarrassing.
[2:19:23.360 --> 2:19:31.160]  Perhaps that is the only real link to Russia, because the president was already decided
[2:19:31.160 --> 2:19:38.760]  to fire Mr. Comey because of his erratic nature, and for the fact that he was empire building.
[2:19:38.760 --> 2:19:39.760]  All right, stay there.
[2:19:39.760 --> 2:19:40.760]  Stay there.
[2:19:40.760 --> 2:19:43.360]  I want to come back and talk about the state of things, but I want to get the big picture
[2:19:43.360 --> 2:19:44.360]  from both of you.
[2:19:44.360 --> 2:19:47.600]  I mean, how are these attacks working on Trump?
[2:19:47.600 --> 2:19:51.400]  Everybody I talk to is completely sick of it, including liberals, but does that matter?
[2:19:51.400 --> 2:19:55.080]  The Democrats just seem more like piranhas than ever, so I want to ask you just vote
[2:19:55.080 --> 2:19:58.200]  the state of the union, and then about Megyn Kelly, because I mean, it's one of the biggest
[2:19:58.200 --> 2:19:59.840]  stories in the country.
[2:19:59.840 --> 2:20:04.880]  By now you know that wireless technology like cell phones do in fact pose dangers to the
[2:20:04.880 --> 2:20:07.120]  health and privacy of everyone.

[2:20:50.840 --> 2:21:07.560]  I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already
[2:21:07.560 --> 2:21:12.920]  trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic
[2:21:12.920 --> 2:21:13.920]  and high quality.
[2:21:13.920 --> 2:21:20.080]  This is one of the top three selling organic brands in the country that puts out high quality
[2:21:20.080 --> 2:21:23.040]  organic shampoo, mouthwash, you name it.
[2:21:23.040 --> 2:21:27.520]  And they're such patriots, they have let us basically keep their well-known packaging.
[2:21:27.520 --> 2:21:31.440]  It is an answer to prayer, and because we're cutting out the middleman, 20% off retail,
[2:21:31.440 --> 2:21:34.680]  sign up for auto-ship, an additional 25% off.

[2:21:41.160 --> 2:21:45.720]  It is the exact same product, just the name is different, EmRick's Essentials, and it's
[2:21:45.720 --> 2:21:52.000]  on average 20% off what it would be in stores buying it directly from infowarstore.com.

[2:21:59.040 --> 2:22:03.480]  Hi, this is Ron Paul, former Congressman and Republican presidential candidate.
[2:22:03.480 --> 2:22:07.840]  I love these summer months because this is when I get to enjoy the fresh fruits and vegetables
[2:22:07.840 --> 2:22:11.640]  that are being harvested on small farms and in our backyards.
[2:22:11.640 --> 2:22:14.640]  We all look forward to garden tomatoes and corn on the cob.
[2:22:14.640 --> 2:22:18.480]  Know you wish there was a better way to preserve their true taste and flavors?
[2:22:18.480 --> 2:22:21.320]  I'm here to tell you that there is a better way.
[2:22:21.320 --> 2:22:25.480]  It's by using the amazing home freeze dryer from Harvest Right.
[2:22:25.480 --> 2:22:29.640]  I have a Harvest Right freeze dryer and use it to preserve the foods I love.
[2:22:29.640 --> 2:22:34.880]  Strawberries, apples, and even lasagna and ice cream can stay fresh for 25 years.
[2:22:34.880 --> 2:22:39.400]  And the best part of my freeze drying is my family and I have a supply of long-lasting
[2:22:39.400 --> 2:22:44.040]  food on hand, so no matter what may come, we feel better prepared.
[2:22:44.040 --> 2:22:45.760]  We love our freeze dryer.
[2:22:45.760 --> 2:22:52.160]  To learn more, go to HarvestRight.com or call 800-923-9591.
[2:22:52.160 --> 2:22:58.160]  That's HarvestRight.com or 800-923-9591.
[2:22:58.160 --> 2:22:59.160]  I'm Chris Walton.
[2:22:59.160 --> 2:23:00.160]  I'm a truck driver from Missouri.
[2:23:00.160 --> 2:23:03.240]  For 13 hours a night, I sit in my truck and I drive.
[2:23:03.240 --> 2:23:04.760]  On a boredom, I'll stop and eat.
[2:23:04.760 --> 2:23:08.520]  If I'm not doing fast food, I guarantee there's a bag of chips open on my dashboard.
[2:23:08.520 --> 2:23:10.160]  That was all until Andro 400.
[2:23:10.160 --> 2:23:14.840]  I started out four months ago and since taking Andro 400, I have dropped 45 pounds.
[2:23:14.840 --> 2:23:15.840]  I'm sleeping better.
[2:23:15.840 --> 2:23:16.840]  There's no cravings.
[2:23:16.840 --> 2:23:18.520]  I actually don't even think about food.
[2:23:18.520 --> 2:23:19.920]  My knee pain went away.
[2:23:19.920 --> 2:23:24.320]  I've had some lower back issues and I've noticed that that went away and I can only
[2:23:24.320 --> 2:23:26.800]  contribute that to Andro 400.
[2:23:26.800 --> 2:23:30.240]  One thing that Andro 400 said on the radio ad is it attacks belly fat.
[2:23:30.240 --> 2:23:31.400]  Well, let me tell you it did.
[2:23:31.400 --> 2:23:36.400]  The second month is where I saw a drastic change in the size of my stomach.
[2:23:36.400 --> 2:23:37.760]  I've lost six inches.
[2:23:37.760 --> 2:23:39.360]  This product really does work.
[2:23:39.360 --> 2:23:45.840]  So guys, if you'd like to experience similar results, then get Andro 400, the safe, natural
[2:23:45.840 --> 2:23:48.960]  and inexpensive way to boost your testosterone.
[2:23:48.960 --> 2:23:57.040]  Go to andro400.com or call 888-404-35.
[2:23:57.040 --> 2:24:02.760]  888-404-35.
[2:24:02.760 --> 2:24:06.440]  The former head of psychological warfare operations for the Central Intelligence Agency,
[2:24:06.440 --> 2:24:11.840]  Supposed to say State Department, Dr. Steve Pochenick will be joining us to give us his
[2:24:11.840 --> 2:24:15.320]  take on the Psiop that Megyn Kelly's been engaged in.
[2:24:15.320 --> 2:24:16.560]  He's been blowing my phone up.
[2:24:16.560 --> 2:24:20.360]  I just talked to him during the break and we'll get his take on that to see if it meshes
[2:24:20.360 --> 2:24:23.400]  with my current CIA contacts that are pretty high up.
[2:24:23.400 --> 2:24:25.160]  So that's coming up at about 40 after.
[2:24:25.160 --> 2:24:26.760]  Lionel's got to leave in a few minutes.
[2:24:26.760 --> 2:24:30.880]  Roger's going to say to 40 after he'll get into palace, intrigue and White House shake-ups
[2:24:30.880 --> 2:24:31.880]  at the next segment.
[2:24:31.880 --> 2:24:38.760]  But because this one is short, I want to ask both Lionel first and then Roger Stone.
[2:24:38.760 --> 2:24:39.760]  Everybody's been saying it.
[2:24:39.760 --> 2:24:42.280]  I've been saying it first and I'm not bragging, it's just a fact.
[2:24:42.280 --> 2:24:43.520]  They're planning a civil war.
[2:24:43.520 --> 2:24:45.560]  They're planning a COG overthrow.
[2:24:45.560 --> 2:24:46.560]  They now are admitting it.
[2:24:46.560 --> 2:24:48.000]  Well, I've just studied deep state.
[2:24:48.000 --> 2:24:49.000]  That's how it operates.
[2:24:49.000 --> 2:24:51.220]  Again, I was talking about deep state 20 years ago.
[2:24:51.220 --> 2:24:52.220]  Not bragging, folks.
[2:24:52.220 --> 2:24:53.360]  We're just not fake news.
[2:24:53.360 --> 2:24:55.560]  They hate it because we know how they operate.
[2:24:55.560 --> 2:24:56.560]  There's rogue elements.
[2:24:56.560 --> 2:25:00.200]  The whole deep state isn't the enemy because anything secret in government's deep state.
[2:25:00.200 --> 2:25:04.960]  There's rogue elements at the top, bought off by globalists that are doing this.
[2:25:04.960 --> 2:25:07.880]  Let me ask Lionel this, they're talking about civil war.
[2:25:07.880 --> 2:25:10.400]  They're saying kill Trump everywhere.
[2:25:10.400 --> 2:25:12.040]  They just seem to be so arrogant.
[2:25:12.040 --> 2:25:15.160]  Where do you see all this going and then Roger Stone?
[2:25:15.160 --> 2:25:20.440]  I see ultimately a stronger, I don't want to be Nietzschean about this, but I see a stronger
[2:25:20.440 --> 2:25:21.640]  Trump.
[2:25:21.640 --> 2:25:27.960]  And from the time he came in, there was an attack from every flank, every area, every
[2:25:27.960 --> 2:25:31.840]  advantage, every direction, Steve Bannon said it best.
[2:25:31.840 --> 2:25:36.560]  He said, if you think that they're going to just hand this back to us, these people
[2:25:36.560 --> 2:25:38.160]  are going to relinquish their power.
[2:25:38.160 --> 2:25:43.880]  When you have a person in Donald Trump that is loathed by every faction, every contingent,
[2:25:43.880 --> 2:25:45.840]  every direction, every party, you name it.
[2:25:45.840 --> 2:25:48.880]  The press, the left, the right, the Democrats, the Republicans, you name it.
[2:25:48.880 --> 2:25:51.440]  And that's frankly, I think, part of his charm.
[2:25:51.440 --> 2:25:54.960]  From the beginning, they are throwing everything they can at him.
[2:25:54.960 --> 2:25:57.800]  And what they're trying to do right now, let me just say something.
[2:25:57.800 --> 2:26:00.640]  There is nothing more dangerous than a special prosecutor.
[2:26:00.640 --> 2:26:02.560]  Go back to the days of Scooter Libby.
[2:26:02.560 --> 2:26:03.560]  Remember that.
[2:26:03.560 --> 2:26:08.920]  And why anybody would want to remove the most ineffective, ineffectual, weak, in a feet
[2:26:08.920 --> 2:26:14.880]  of prosecutor or FBI director like Comey, why would you want to remove him?
[2:26:14.880 --> 2:26:19.120]  Why would you not let him just sit there and just wax ineffectual?
[2:26:19.120 --> 2:26:23.880]  I never understood that because Mueller is scary, scary good.
[2:26:23.880 --> 2:26:27.640]  And also what happens is, remember, through habituation and through the conditioning
[2:26:27.640 --> 2:26:33.120]  of an audience, you can tell them over and over again that something exists when it doesn't.
[2:26:33.120 --> 2:26:36.160]  How many people believe that Russia somehow hacked into the election?
[2:26:36.160 --> 2:26:40.760]  How many people believe that somehow the president involved himself in obstruction of justice?
[2:26:40.760 --> 2:26:45.640]  Even though every scholar, up to and including Alan Dershowitz, not a big fan of the president,
[2:26:45.640 --> 2:26:50.600]  has said not only can the president fire Comey, he can threaten him and he can also say,
[2:26:50.600 --> 2:26:51.600]  I just ran into him.
[2:26:51.600 --> 2:26:52.600]  Exactly.
[2:26:52.600 --> 2:26:53.600]  So they're trying to paralyze the president.
[2:26:53.600 --> 2:26:55.600]  They're trying to shut him down.
[2:26:55.600 --> 2:26:56.600]  Thank you so much.
[2:26:56.600 --> 2:26:57.600]  Thank you.
[2:26:57.600 --> 2:26:58.600]  Great points.
[2:26:58.600 --> 2:26:59.600]  God bless you.
[2:26:59.600 --> 2:27:00.600]  Thank you.
[2:27:00.600 --> 2:27:01.600]  Thank you.
[2:27:01.600 --> 2:27:02.600]  Let me go back to Roger Stone on the time we have left in this segment and we'll go back
[2:27:02.600 --> 2:27:05.400]  to the court intrigue and other big shoes to drop.
[2:27:05.400 --> 2:27:06.600]  Do you agree with Lionel?
[2:27:06.600 --> 2:27:08.600]  Where do you see this going?
[2:27:08.600 --> 2:27:12.240]  Well, I think the path here is fairly clear.
[2:27:12.240 --> 2:27:19.600]  The NSA and these House and Senate Intelligence Committees having come up with not an aorta
[2:27:19.600 --> 2:27:27.120]  of evidence of rushing collusion with Donald Trump or his agents and therefore they have
[2:27:27.120 --> 2:27:33.120]  now manufactured this event with Mr. Comey.
[2:27:33.120 --> 2:27:41.880]  Mr. Mueller will be inclined to see this, Mr. Comey's way and I believe it is the plan
[2:27:41.880 --> 2:27:49.800]  of the establishment to bring a charge of obstruction as a means of achieving what they
[2:27:49.800 --> 2:27:55.800]  could not achieve at the ballot box, the removal of our president.
[2:27:55.800 --> 2:28:02.440]  Unfortunately, I think the option of firing Mr. Mueller, who let's remember was foisted
[2:28:02.440 --> 2:28:10.240]  on the president by Mr. Rosenstein, is probably more difficult now in due of some of the recently
[2:28:10.240 --> 2:28:12.240]  engaged parties.
[2:28:12.240 --> 2:28:13.240]  How do you neuter him?
[2:28:13.240 --> 2:28:16.400]  Just point out all his democratic connections, put out all the corruption, expose it?
[2:28:16.400 --> 2:28:20.760]  I think you have no choice but right now to point out that he was coaching Comey before
[2:28:20.760 --> 2:28:23.240]  his testimony that he has been a person.
[2:28:23.240 --> 2:28:27.240]  So there's total collusion and Comey even admitted, I did all this to get him in.
[2:28:27.240 --> 2:28:30.720]  I mean, he admits his conspiracy.
[2:28:30.720 --> 2:28:37.000]  And the audacity that revolving door style, he was actually auditioning for Comey's position
[2:28:37.000 --> 2:28:40.520]  at the FBI, which went to a...
[2:28:40.520 --> 2:28:44.200]  So you've got classic shower grapes that got illegally leaking a nothing burger.
[2:28:44.200 --> 2:28:45.200]  They're pissed off.
[2:28:45.200 --> 2:28:50.320]  He's coaching him, admitting collusion and then Comey arrogantly admits a conspiracy
[2:28:50.320 --> 2:28:53.600]  against the president to bring in his buddy to bring him down.
[2:28:53.600 --> 2:28:57.240]  How is that not total recusal of Mr. Mueller?
[2:28:57.240 --> 2:29:01.080]  No, I think you're precisely right.
[2:29:01.080 --> 2:29:08.280]  And therefore you have standing by the whole democratic left-wing mainstream media machinery
[2:29:08.280 --> 2:29:16.160]  who will then make this the rationale for their impeachment movement against our president.
[2:29:16.160 --> 2:29:18.680]  It won't wash for two reasons.
[2:29:18.680 --> 2:29:27.000]  One, at best, I think the overall conclusion regarding Mr. Comey's testimony was that it
[2:29:27.000 --> 2:29:33.080]  was a done and that he suffered in that at least half of the people in America have seen
[2:29:33.080 --> 2:29:34.600]  through this entire charade.
[2:29:34.600 --> 2:29:35.600]  That's right.
[2:29:35.600 --> 2:29:40.360]  So does Mueller and the Clintons and the globalist, the neocons have the nerve to overthrow a
[2:29:40.360 --> 2:29:45.000]  sitting Americana president for nothing when they're so arrogant, they admit they brought
[2:29:45.000 --> 2:29:48.400]  Mueller and in collusion to overthrow the American people.
[2:29:48.400 --> 2:29:50.400]  What a group of arrogant assholes.
[2:29:50.400 --> 2:29:57.880]  The Empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[2:33:21.160 --> 2:33:27.120]  I forget the Marine Corps General in Korea, but they were surrounded by about a million
[2:33:27.120 --> 2:33:28.120]  Chinese troops.
[2:33:28.120 --> 2:33:32.240]  There was only about 50,000 Marines, and the Army couldn't get to them.
[2:33:32.240 --> 2:33:34.640]  And the famous general, they said, sir, we're completely surrounded.
[2:33:34.640 --> 2:33:38.280]  And he said, good, now we can attack in all directions.
[2:33:38.280 --> 2:33:39.280]  It's a famous quote.
[2:33:39.280 --> 2:33:40.280]  We'll pull it up in a minute.
[2:33:40.280 --> 2:33:44.640]  And there's some other similar quotes by the Korean War Colonel Lewis B. Puller.
[2:33:44.640 --> 2:33:46.440]  We've been looking for the enemy for some time now.
[2:33:46.440 --> 2:33:47.440]  We finally found them.
[2:33:47.440 --> 2:33:48.440]  We're surrounded.
[2:33:48.440 --> 2:33:49.440]  That simplifies things.
[2:33:49.440 --> 2:33:52.480]  And that was from the battle of the Chosin Reservoir.
[2:33:52.480 --> 2:33:57.280]  But I mean, I'm being, folks, the fact that they are desperately attacking everybody,
[2:33:57.280 --> 2:34:04.280]  the fact that they're frothing and going insane just shows how weak they are.
[2:34:04.280 --> 2:34:05.280]  Yeah, there it is.
[2:34:05.280 --> 2:34:08.480]  Major General Oliver Smith said, retreat hell.
[2:34:08.480 --> 2:34:09.800]  We're attacking in all directions.
[2:34:09.800 --> 2:34:12.160]  And that was from the same battle.
[2:34:12.160 --> 2:34:15.680]  And then people under him basically said the same thing.
[2:34:15.680 --> 2:34:16.800]  And that's actually true.
[2:34:16.800 --> 2:34:20.680]  That's when you're winning is when they're all firing and they're weak and in weaker
[2:34:20.680 --> 2:34:23.320]  positions and you've got superior weapons.
[2:34:23.320 --> 2:34:24.320]  We've got Americana.
[2:34:24.320 --> 2:34:25.320]  We've got the truth.
[2:34:25.320 --> 2:34:26.960]  We've got the stock market exploding.
[2:34:26.960 --> 2:34:28.440]  We've got the borders being secured.
[2:34:28.440 --> 2:34:30.120]  We've got ISIS being crushed.
[2:34:30.120 --> 2:34:32.720]  We've got TPP, this global takeover being killed.
[2:34:32.720 --> 2:34:37.400]  We've got the Paris Accord been meant to screw us over that nobody else has to follow dead
[2:34:37.400 --> 2:34:38.400]  in the water.
[2:34:38.400 --> 2:34:43.040]  I mean, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, I've gone from cautiously Trump to just like, I can't
[2:34:43.040 --> 2:34:46.440]  believe people aren't more realizing this is the epic battle.
[2:34:46.440 --> 2:34:50.360]  But selfishly, before you finish up with some of the King's Court stuff and other tidbits,
[2:34:50.360 --> 2:34:55.000]  Roger Stone of StoneCulture.com soon again to officially be with him for just kind of
[2:34:55.000 --> 2:34:56.000]  cement the deal.
[2:34:56.000 --> 2:35:00.360]  Those are all so busy, you know, watching new, new, new operations and take some time
[2:35:00.360 --> 2:35:02.960]  because we're actually taking action.
[2:35:02.960 --> 2:35:04.520]  We're not just doing this on the drawn board here, folks.
[2:35:04.520 --> 2:35:05.520]  This is the real world.
[2:35:05.520 --> 2:35:06.520]  Changing the world.
[2:35:06.520 --> 2:35:09.000]  Megan Kelly, give me your real assessment.
[2:35:09.000 --> 2:35:10.520]  They're trying to brand me as fake news.
[2:35:10.520 --> 2:35:11.800]  They're really coming after me.
[2:35:11.800 --> 2:35:13.600]  Why is it effective?
[2:35:13.600 --> 2:35:15.600]  Where's it going?
[2:35:15.600 --> 2:35:21.120]  I'm reminded when you mentioned Megan Kelly of that epic poem that the president recited
[2:35:21.120 --> 2:35:24.440]  during the campaign called The Snake.
[2:35:24.440 --> 2:35:32.080]  She's very charming and too many men find her very beautiful, but she's deadly.
[2:35:32.080 --> 2:35:40.800]  And you never know how these incredibly talented film editors and news editors at her new network
[2:35:40.800 --> 2:35:47.920]  will splice and dice to make anyone that they interview look terrible.
[2:35:47.920 --> 2:35:54.320]  I frankly think that, um, that, uh, Vladimir Putin bitch slapped her on television.
[2:35:54.320 --> 2:35:59.120]  Many Americans I know who watched that thought it was, uh, that he handled her precisely
[2:35:59.120 --> 2:36:01.200]  because she's desperate for a win.
[2:36:01.200 --> 2:36:03.320]  He only gave her 15 minutes at lunch.
[2:36:03.320 --> 2:36:04.320]  She goes off record.
[2:36:04.320 --> 2:36:05.320]  He's just intriguing.
[2:36:05.320 --> 2:36:08.120]  And she even blushed and went, so I guess she has a soul.
[2:36:08.120 --> 2:36:11.000]  She was like, oh, oh, he's so intriguing.
[2:36:11.000 --> 2:36:14.680]  Oh, she almost, I mean, she almost had an orgasm talking about Putin.
[2:36:14.680 --> 2:36:15.840]  I mean, I'm serious.
[2:36:15.840 --> 2:36:20.480]  So I kind of feel bad cause I gave him 12 hours and was totally open and nice and they're
[2:36:20.480 --> 2:36:22.000]  going to edit the living hell out of me.
[2:36:22.000 --> 2:36:23.000]  But you know what?
[2:36:23.000 --> 2:36:24.240]  I went into the Gorgons nest.
[2:36:24.240 --> 2:36:25.360]  I faced her.
[2:36:25.360 --> 2:36:26.600]  I don't think I destroyed her.
[2:36:26.600 --> 2:36:28.240]  I think she's already destroyed herself.
[2:36:28.240 --> 2:36:31.600]  I think she's, I think she's going to have a dead cat bounce from this interview, but
[2:36:31.600 --> 2:36:33.880]  I think Megan Kelly unless propped up is going the way up.
[2:36:33.880 --> 2:36:34.880]  Here's Morgan.
[2:36:34.880 --> 2:36:41.720]  But here's the best thing, Alex, and that is she, she's just kicking your name identification
[2:36:41.720 --> 2:36:43.920]  into the stratosphere.
[2:36:43.920 --> 2:36:49.440]  Millions of Americans will get to find out at least who Alex Jones is.
[2:36:49.440 --> 2:36:50.440]  Let's go further.
[2:36:50.440 --> 2:36:51.440]  It's not her.
[2:36:51.440 --> 2:36:52.440]  We have more audience than she does.
[2:36:52.440 --> 2:36:56.440]  The entire global media of the new world order is attacking me right now as if I'm Satan
[2:36:56.440 --> 2:36:57.440]  himself.
[2:36:57.440 --> 2:36:58.440]  Why is that?
[2:36:58.440 --> 2:37:04.440]  Well, look, I want to say to all the corporate America, yes, Megan Kelly is making Alex Jones
[2:37:04.440 --> 2:37:05.440]  even bigger.
[2:37:05.440 --> 2:37:09.440]  Perhaps you should cancel your advertising.
[2:37:09.440 --> 2:37:11.880]  I mean, this is an absurdity, Alex.
[2:37:11.880 --> 2:37:17.760]  So we all know this is going to be a hit piece, a carefully edited hit piece.
[2:37:17.760 --> 2:37:22.840]  We all know it can be done through the art of skillful editing.
[2:37:22.840 --> 2:37:29.000]  But at the end of the day, the credit goes to the man who climbs in the arena, the man
[2:37:29.000 --> 2:37:35.440]  who goes toe-to-toe with the face of the mainstream media in an effort to twist.
[2:37:35.440 --> 2:37:36.440]  That's right.
[2:37:36.440 --> 2:37:41.760]  In Medusa's nest, with both my arms tied behind my back, I went into the Gorgons lair.
[2:37:41.760 --> 2:37:44.080]  And by the way, I'm not joking.
[2:37:44.080 --> 2:37:47.840]  When she talked about Putin, I'm sitting there, reten barbecue, they're not rolling.
[2:37:47.840 --> 2:37:52.320]  I go, how was Putin, and she goes, and she said off record after, no, sorry, somebody,
[2:37:52.320 --> 2:38:03.200]  she goes, he was intriguing, I mean, she was just like balled up, that was the only time
[2:38:03.200 --> 2:38:04.200]  I saw any life in her.
[2:38:04.200 --> 2:38:05.720]  She obviously didn't like me, which is fine.
[2:38:05.720 --> 2:38:06.720]  I mean, I didn't like her.
[2:38:06.720 --> 2:38:10.600]  I'm not in love with like, you know, snow, snow witches, seriously, I don't have junk
[2:38:10.600 --> 2:38:11.600]  in the trunk.
[2:38:11.600 --> 2:38:13.640]  I thought she might have been a robot looking in her eyes.
[2:38:13.640 --> 2:38:19.520]  They look like, you know, basically marbles, but seriously, why do you think she got so
[2:38:19.520 --> 2:38:26.000]  like cringe and actually looked down and went intriguing, man, what was going on with her?
[2:38:26.000 --> 2:38:31.760]  Well, first of all, I had understood that she was wiggling around her chair, bro.
[2:38:31.760 --> 2:38:32.760]  She was wiggling.
[2:38:32.760 --> 2:38:37.640]  My understanding was, you were going to take her to a fine steak restaurant.
[2:38:37.640 --> 2:38:44.280]  Then I hear that you dined in some, some described it as a second rate barbecue joint.
[2:38:44.280 --> 2:38:51.280]  She, I'm sure turned down the charm and she was gooey and cloying right up to the episecond
[2:38:51.280 --> 2:38:53.320]  that they turned the camera on.
[2:38:53.320 --> 2:38:57.320]  And then she lunged for your throat like a viper.
[2:38:57.320 --> 2:38:58.320]  Or is that wrong?
[2:38:58.320 --> 2:39:03.120]  Oh, oh, oh, I've got it on tape because I mean, I knew it was a viper operation.
[2:39:03.120 --> 2:39:05.840]  She's like, oh, I'm so obsessed with you.
[2:39:05.840 --> 2:39:10.480]  I want to have a big juicy steak and I want to have a dessert with you.
[2:39:10.480 --> 2:39:12.600]  It's going to be a nice piece of profile.
[2:39:12.600 --> 2:39:14.000]  You're such a big man.
[2:39:14.000 --> 2:39:15.000]  You're so famous.
[2:39:15.000 --> 2:39:18.880]  I mean, I felt like in the movies I've seen, she's like, hey, honey, why don't you come
[2:39:18.880 --> 2:39:19.880]  up and see me sometime?
[2:39:19.880 --> 2:39:22.960]  I mean, I'm not a big topless bar guy, but I went to topless bars in college.
[2:39:22.960 --> 2:39:25.840]  It was like when they walk up and like, oh, baby, you want to lap dance?
[2:39:25.840 --> 2:39:30.840]  I mean, it was like, oh, yeah, you're really going to like this and I'm the one.
[2:39:30.840 --> 2:39:33.040]  And I was just like, wow, I'm big.
[2:39:33.040 --> 2:39:35.240]  And I was like, listen, I know this is fake sweetheart.
[2:39:35.240 --> 2:39:36.240]  You want publicity?
[2:39:36.240 --> 2:39:37.240]  I'm willing to get it.
[2:39:37.240 --> 2:39:38.680]  You come on to town.
[2:39:38.680 --> 2:39:40.320]  And so yeah, that was totally fake.
[2:39:40.320 --> 2:39:41.920]  She was the fakest I've ever seen.
[2:39:41.920 --> 2:39:45.200]  The worst cross examination, I'm just so jaded.
[2:39:45.200 --> 2:39:48.720]  I didn't give a damn by the end, but they're going to edit the hell out of me.
[2:39:48.720 --> 2:39:56.480]  Well, Alex, a number of the on air correspondence at Fox have expressed to me privately that
[2:39:56.480 --> 2:40:04.000]  she is a vicious, dangerous, calculating that she cuts corners and she doesn't really
[2:40:04.000 --> 2:40:09.800]  care who she climbs over in her ascent to TV stardom.
[2:40:09.800 --> 2:40:12.520]  And these are people who work with her.
[2:40:12.520 --> 2:40:19.600]  So everybody is waiting with bated breath to see how they try to manipulate this interview,
[2:40:19.600 --> 2:40:24.800]  but your willingness to stand tall against the goal, the list, your willingness to call
[2:40:24.800 --> 2:40:30.560]  it the way you say it, your willingness not to be censored by the those who demand political
[2:40:30.560 --> 2:40:32.120]  correctness.
[2:40:32.120 --> 2:40:37.080]  This is what's gaining you and him for the war is an extraordinary audience of Liberty
[2:40:37.080 --> 2:40:42.160]  minded Americans as well as international.
[2:40:42.160 --> 2:40:43.160]  Well it's amazing.
[2:40:43.160 --> 2:40:45.640]  I wonder what the headline of this little video is we're about to step out of the live
[2:40:45.640 --> 2:40:46.640]  show.
[2:40:46.640 --> 2:40:51.600]  Megan Kelly in love with Vladimir Putin, Megan Kelly appeared to become a roused and I'm
[2:40:51.600 --> 2:40:52.600]  not just joking.
[2:40:52.600 --> 2:40:56.280]  It was like watching young girls when they saw Elvis throwing their panties at him.
[2:40:56.280 --> 2:40:59.080]  I mean, she looked down, she wiggled around.
[2:40:59.080 --> 2:41:03.960]  She really like balled up was the only time she acted like a woman when she talked about
[2:41:03.960 --> 2:41:08.400]  Putin, she just, oh, how is it, Triggy, oh, this is amazing.
[2:41:08.400 --> 2:41:12.120]  Oh, I mean, what the hell is going on here?
[2:41:12.120 --> 2:41:18.040]  I think that's called gushing Alex, that's it, Megan Kelly gushed over Vladimir Putin
[2:41:18.040 --> 2:41:19.040]  to Alex Jones.
[2:41:19.040 --> 2:41:22.400]  Yeah, I think I think that's the name of the segment right there.
[2:41:22.400 --> 2:41:28.080]  Let's, let's just to put that baby out there, look, she is, she's going to get nailed out
[2:41:28.080 --> 2:41:29.080]  of this.
[2:41:29.080 --> 2:41:30.080]  Sorry.
[2:41:30.080 --> 2:41:37.640]  It's funny to see her friends on the far left chiding her for giving Alex Jones a platform.
[2:41:37.640 --> 2:41:42.120]  This is like, give me the popcorn and let me sit back because here's a fight which I
[2:41:42.120 --> 2:41:43.640]  don't care who wins.
[2:41:43.640 --> 2:41:46.520]  I'd like to see them kill each other metaphor.
[2:41:46.520 --> 2:41:47.520]  Exactly.
[2:41:47.520 --> 2:41:51.000]  It's going to be a total train wreck that's totally edited from the promo piece.
[2:41:51.000 --> 2:41:57.200]  I saw just, I mean, 30 minutes on each subject, so it's just all scrambled malarkey lighting
[2:41:57.200 --> 2:42:00.280]  from below incredible stoneculture.com.
[2:42:00.280 --> 2:42:01.520]  Things are so fast and furious.
[2:42:01.520 --> 2:42:02.520]  Please come back on every day.
[2:42:02.520 --> 2:42:05.200]  Soon you're going to be hosting a show every day.
[2:42:05.200 --> 2:42:06.200]  God bless you.
[2:42:06.200 --> 2:42:07.200]  We appreciate your Roger Stone.
[2:42:07.200 --> 2:42:11.360]  Alex, I heard that they hot boxed you in a vacant home.
[2:42:11.360 --> 2:42:15.600]  They cranked the heat up over a hundred scheduled the interview late at the night when they
[2:42:15.600 --> 2:42:22.440]  thought perhaps you had a cocktail or two when in fact you were sober as a judge.
[2:42:22.440 --> 2:42:24.280]  And I heard you gave as good as you got.
[2:42:24.280 --> 2:42:28.160]  So God bless you and I look forward to being with you this week.
[2:42:28.160 --> 2:42:29.160]  Well, thank you.
[2:42:29.160 --> 2:42:30.640]  No, I mean, I did give as good as I got.
[2:42:30.640 --> 2:42:35.840]  The problem was she would just stop and then do a zinger like, oh, so you glad the gays
[2:42:35.840 --> 2:42:36.840]  died.
[2:42:36.840 --> 2:42:37.840]  I'd go, what?
[2:42:37.840 --> 2:42:41.280]  She go, you know, at the post nightclub, you said they deserve to die.
[2:42:41.280 --> 2:42:42.280]  And I'd be like, no, I didn't.
[2:42:42.280 --> 2:42:45.360]  I said, why do liberals bring in Islamists that kill liberals?
[2:42:45.360 --> 2:42:46.360]  I'm sad they killed them.
[2:42:46.360 --> 2:42:47.640]  I mean, it was just, it was horrible.
[2:42:47.640 --> 2:42:50.320]  It just was constant, constant, constant.
[2:42:50.320 --> 2:42:51.320]  Roger.
[2:42:51.320 --> 2:42:52.320]  Thank you.
[2:42:52.320 --> 2:42:53.320]  Many thanks.
[2:42:53.320 --> 2:42:57.240]  And joining us is Dr. Steve Pachennick who ran psychological warfare operations for the
[2:42:57.240 --> 2:42:58.480]  State Department of the CIA.
[2:42:58.480 --> 2:42:59.480]  You name it.
[2:42:59.480 --> 2:43:03.880]  Help found Delta Force with General Schumacher and of course, Boykin.
[2:43:03.880 --> 2:43:07.600]  And of course, is a bestselling author with Tom Clancy produced a lot of big Hollywood
[2:43:07.600 --> 2:43:08.600]  films.
[2:43:08.600 --> 2:43:12.240]  Steve Pachennick talks is his latest book, Steve Pachennick.com is a really great website.
[2:43:12.240 --> 2:43:16.480]  It looks better than info wars.com sessions hearing has begun.
[2:43:16.480 --> 2:43:20.920]  If folks want to see the sessions hearing, it's on info wars.com with Owen shroyer with
[2:43:20.920 --> 2:43:26.560]  a live feed with commentary during the breaks and documents and analysis being put up.
[2:43:26.560 --> 2:43:31.200]  So you don't just put out the senators propaganda or folks, you actually can see documents over
[2:43:31.200 --> 2:43:32.700]  what really happened.
[2:43:32.700 --> 2:43:35.200]  So our feed is at info wars.com.
[2:43:35.200 --> 2:43:37.680]  And if you want to get the sessions feed, it's at info wars.com.
[2:43:37.680 --> 2:43:41.600]  I know many stations may have broken in and are carrying that part of the latest witch
[2:43:41.600 --> 2:43:43.240]  hunt as well.
[2:43:43.240 --> 2:43:46.400]  Richard Burr is asking questions right now.
[2:43:46.400 --> 2:43:48.200]  But joining us is Dr. Steve Pachennick.
[2:43:48.200 --> 2:43:52.000]  I hate to make myself the center of attention literally because at this level it's pretty
[2:43:52.000 --> 2:43:54.800]  dangerous, but they're obsessed.
[2:43:54.800 --> 2:43:55.800]  They're demonizing.
[2:43:55.800 --> 2:43:58.480]  Pachennick is, thanks Sandy, it was totally staged.
[2:43:58.480 --> 2:44:03.640]  I've looked at all angles with the media cock staging babies and incubators and all these
[2:44:03.640 --> 2:44:04.640]  lies.
[2:44:04.640 --> 2:44:05.920]  I said, did they kill a bunch of kids?
[2:44:05.920 --> 2:44:06.920]  Was it all actors?
[2:44:06.920 --> 2:44:09.280]  We saw a lot of anomalies or did they really kill some kids?
[2:44:09.280 --> 2:44:12.480]  A lot of anomalies, but Pachennick believes it's totally staged.
[2:44:12.480 --> 2:44:15.920]  He exposed that they would roll bin Laden out 14 years before they did.
[2:44:15.920 --> 2:44:20.040]  And of course it's come out, I've talked to military folks, Navy Seals, Army, people
[2:44:20.040 --> 2:44:22.760]  on the boat, they say there was no bin Laden.
[2:44:22.760 --> 2:44:25.680]  But these are known liars and we didn't question them, we'd be insane.
[2:44:25.680 --> 2:44:31.440]  But separate from Sandy Hook, Dr. Pachennick, why are they coming after little old me?
[2:44:31.440 --> 2:44:37.000]  Because again, it seems like our audience is getting bigger, our traffic's at record
[2:44:37.000 --> 2:44:42.440]  levels, people are supporting us, we've got sponsors knocking down our doors.
[2:44:42.440 --> 2:44:47.840]  I don't understand what's going on here with this being one of the number, this was number
[2:44:47.840 --> 2:44:48.840]  one yesterday.
[2:44:48.840 --> 2:44:52.360]  It's the second biggest story in the country right now after sessions.
[2:44:52.360 --> 2:44:57.880]  What is happening as a psychological warfare expert who's fought for this country and now
[2:44:57.880 --> 2:45:00.320]  fighting to try to restore the Republic?
[2:45:00.320 --> 2:45:04.800]  Well, Alex, it's always a pleasure to come on on your show and it's always a pleasure
[2:45:04.800 --> 2:45:06.840]  to follow you and Roger.
[2:45:06.840 --> 2:45:11.600]  He said, I thought it was funny, but you kind of answered your own question.
[2:45:11.600 --> 2:45:15.200]  Let me give you an example of what I'm talking about.
[2:45:15.200 --> 2:45:21.440]  Jealousy is, I would like to wear something that you have, your jacket, I would like to
[2:45:21.440 --> 2:45:24.440]  have a show like yours, that's jealousy.
[2:45:24.440 --> 2:45:31.000]  But what you're seeing now is far more destructive and that dynamic is called envy.
[2:45:31.000 --> 2:45:37.120]  In your question, you answered the very element that the media can no longer address, the
[2:45:37.120 --> 2:45:41.080]  normal media or whatever they want to call it, the mainstream media.
[2:45:41.080 --> 2:45:45.080]  You're number one, you create an alternative narrative.
[2:45:45.080 --> 2:45:51.680]  You are very clear, you stood by your positions, you called what it was a false flag 9-11,
[2:45:51.680 --> 2:45:57.640]  you've been with us for 20 years, you were never cowed, you were never beaten down.
[2:45:57.640 --> 2:46:02.800]  So what the media is doing, they're trying to take you down at the same time that they're
[2:46:02.800 --> 2:46:04.840]  taking themselves down.
[2:46:04.840 --> 2:46:08.800]  Now the issue of self-destruction has been there for quite a while.
[2:46:08.800 --> 2:46:14.640]  You have talked about it, I've talked about it, Roger's talked about it and what's happening
[2:46:14.640 --> 2:46:22.440]  is you're seeing the final cries of an elephant, sorry about the elephant and a donkey that's
[2:46:22.440 --> 2:46:29.360]  basically dying and the media can no longer understand why didn't they get on the internet,
[2:46:29.360 --> 2:46:34.240]  why couldn't they develop what you did, Roger, Alex.
[2:46:34.240 --> 2:46:40.120]  In effect, what this is all about is really the dynamic of envy, they need to tear you
[2:46:40.120 --> 2:46:41.400]  apart.
[2:46:41.400 --> 2:46:48.560]  So Omega and Kelly comes along, she's self-aggrandizing, she says she's really a reporter when in fact
[2:46:48.560 --> 2:46:51.040]  we know she's everything but a reporter.
[2:46:51.040 --> 2:46:56.320]  Her interest is in her narcissism and her beauty and as her first husband said, she
[2:46:56.320 --> 2:47:01.040]  needs a wife and her second husband became a very good wife for her.
[2:47:01.040 --> 2:47:06.000]  I have nothing against that husband, he happens to be a writer and I wish him the best but
[2:47:06.000 --> 2:47:08.960]  the bottom line is very simple.
[2:47:08.960 --> 2:47:14.120]  You will be in the position while they try to tear you down and tear themselves down
[2:47:14.120 --> 2:47:16.120]  of helping them.
[2:47:16.120 --> 2:47:22.640]  And helping them means the ratings for NBC, CNN, ABC, they're all in the toilet.
[2:47:22.640 --> 2:47:27.080]  The industry is in the toilet, I can tell you as part of the producer's Guild of America,
[2:47:27.080 --> 2:47:32.280]  the writer's Guild of America, they don't know how to develop content for the internet.
[2:47:32.280 --> 2:47:38.440]  Now along comes this very bright individual from Texas, they don't even know where Austin
[2:47:38.440 --> 2:47:44.080]  Texas is, you're not from Hollywood, you're from Texas and suddenly your ability to have
[2:47:44.080 --> 2:47:50.960]  a repartee, to be incisive, to be funny, to be able to take yourself not that seriously
[2:47:50.960 --> 2:47:59.920]  but at the same time to promote truth, transparency and be incisive and witty, that is very dangerous
[2:47:59.920 --> 2:48:01.560]  to mainstream media.
[2:48:01.560 --> 2:48:02.560]  So what do you have?
[2:48:02.560 --> 2:48:08.480]  You have an Anderson Cooper, nice sweet guy, openly gay, that's not an issue.
[2:48:08.480 --> 2:48:14.320]  The issue is he forgets to tell you that twice and many other times he's been in the CIA,
[2:48:14.320 --> 2:48:16.600]  had to take the CIA internship.
[2:48:16.600 --> 2:48:22.600]  Many have Fox News, they went after Sean Kennedy, they went after all the people in Fox News,
[2:48:22.600 --> 2:48:28.280]  I knew Roger A.L.'s, I like working with Roger on the Bush administration, but he had played
[2:48:28.280 --> 2:48:32.240]  out whatever he needed to and he did very well at Fox.
[2:48:32.240 --> 2:48:36.640]  Now what happened, the Murdoch Suns are in and they really don't know how to develop
[2:48:36.640 --> 2:48:42.120]  the content, not because it's stupid, it's just part of the mainstream media where content
[2:48:42.120 --> 2:48:44.800]  is king and they don't have it.
[2:48:44.800 --> 2:48:50.880]  Now how do you explain to Hollywood and to the networks that you have an individual here
[2:48:50.880 --> 2:48:55.360]  who may or may not have been a comedian, God only knows what your past is, but I think
[2:48:55.360 --> 2:48:56.360]  it's wonderful.
[2:48:56.360 --> 2:49:04.480]  Who comes out of de novo and creates an entity that's so powerful that you are in the millions.
[2:49:04.480 --> 2:49:09.360]  They can't talk about that at CNN, they can't talk about it at CNBC, they can't talk about
[2:49:09.360 --> 2:49:11.880]  it on anything else.
[2:49:11.880 --> 2:49:15.920]  So you have a race, well I mean info wars isn't that good, but let's expand, it's that they're
[2:49:15.920 --> 2:49:21.800]  that bad, they have to spend millions to reach a million, we spend hundreds of dollars to
[2:49:21.800 --> 2:49:26.520]  reach a million people, they're panicking so they think if they kill us, that will make
[2:49:26.520 --> 2:49:31.520]  them whole because they're projecting, they've destroyed themselves with their lies.
[2:49:31.520 --> 2:49:37.200]  Correct, that's part of the envy, they're self-destructive but they want to make sure
[2:49:37.200 --> 2:49:38.600]  they take you down.
[2:49:38.600 --> 2:49:43.040]  Now in that process, they really don't have the tools to take you down.
[2:49:43.040 --> 2:49:47.360]  I was about to say, it's only making us bigger, I don't understand, I mean are they really
[2:49:47.360 --> 2:49:49.720]  that dumb?
[2:49:49.720 --> 2:49:54.200]  It's not that they're dumb, it's just that they're incompetent, they really have never
[2:49:54.200 --> 2:50:00.520]  been in a scope where you have been in that area, let me explain it, whoever you were,
[2:50:00.520 --> 2:50:05.560]  whoever you might be, that's a separate issue for them, what they can't understand is how
[2:50:05.560 --> 2:50:11.240]  you came out of DeNovo, I literally out of nowhere, and came out of this area in Texas
[2:50:11.240 --> 2:50:17.040]  and developed in the audience that they can't seem to reach, so the only way they seem to
[2:50:17.040 --> 2:50:19.840]  reach it is to mock you, to denigrate you.
[2:50:19.840 --> 2:50:24.080]  That's right, so you just said it, it's not me, it's not even you, it's all of us together,
[2:50:24.080 --> 2:50:28.440]  it's this community of American patriots who aren't left or right, who just want America
[2:50:28.440 --> 2:50:30.800]  back, they hate us.
[2:50:30.800 --> 2:50:35.160]  They hate you, they hate me too, let me tell you, I'm not going to tell you, I have an
[2:50:35.160 --> 2:50:39.880]  agency that I've worked with for 20, 30 years and I've said to them, look, I want to write
[2:50:39.880 --> 2:50:45.000]  about the alternative media, what happened, how it was done, they don't want to represent
[2:50:45.000 --> 2:50:50.720]  anything to do with Alex Jones, they categorically said to me, there's no way we're going to
[2:50:50.720 --> 2:50:54.600]  represent you and dealing with Alex Jones, they don't mind writing about it.
[2:50:54.600 --> 2:50:58.120]  And they don't get that they're not even getting the new blood they need to survive, they're
[2:50:58.120 --> 2:50:59.800]  so stupid, we'll be back.
[2:50:59.800 --> 2:51:02.360]  Are you happy washing your hands with harsh chemicals?
[2:51:02.360 --> 2:51:04.520]  Are you happy doing laundry with detergents?
[2:51:04.520 --> 2:51:06.720]  Are you happy paying high prices?
[2:51:06.720 --> 2:51:08.680]  Find your happiness with pure soap.
[2:51:08.680 --> 2:51:13.440]  These all-natural, earth-friendly, pure soaps are the very best you've ever used.
[2:51:13.440 --> 2:51:20.000]  Buy in bulk, get a 12, 36 or 48 month supply, or get items individually and still save big.
[2:51:20.000 --> 2:51:24.240]  You're getting soap products twice as good as what you're using now, earth-friendly and
[2:51:24.240 --> 2:51:25.560]  natural soaps.
[2:51:25.560 --> 2:51:27.640]  Your family deserves the best.

[2:51:58.080 --> 2:51:59.080]  for a catalog.
[2:51:59.080 --> 2:52:03.640]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[2:52:03.640 --> 2:52:08.320]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[2:52:08.320 --> 2:52:09.840]  to detoxify the body.
[2:52:09.840 --> 2:52:14.680]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[2:52:14.680 --> 2:52:16.200]  It's made in the USA.
[2:52:16.200 --> 2:52:21.120]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[2:52:21.120 --> 2:52:22.920]  the body and it supports the infomer.
[2:52:22.920 --> 2:52:25.160]  It is a classical 360-win.
[2:52:25.160 --> 2:52:29.040]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we've
[2:52:29.040 --> 2:52:34.360]  believed we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[2:52:34.360 --> 2:52:35.360]  get.
[2:52:35.360 --> 2:52:38.440]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this
[2:52:38.440 --> 2:52:43.480]  country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[2:52:43.480 --> 2:52:48.680]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[2:52:48.680 --> 2:52:51.360]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[2:52:51.360 --> 2:52:54.680]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[2:52:54.680 --> 2:52:59.200]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield and FullWarsLive.com.
[2:52:59.200 --> 2:53:04.200]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels
[2:53:04.200 --> 2:53:07.840]  may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[2:53:07.840 --> 2:53:12.880]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are
[2:53:12.880 --> 2:53:16.400]  just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[2:53:16.400 --> 2:53:20.920]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[2:53:20.920 --> 2:53:21.920]  across America.
[2:53:21.920 --> 2:53:25.800]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[2:53:25.800 --> 2:53:29.760]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier
[2:53:29.760 --> 2:53:30.760]  I feel.
[2:53:30.760 --> 2:53:33.080]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[2:53:33.080 --> 2:53:38.280]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative
[2:53:38.280 --> 2:53:40.760]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[2:54:21.800 --> 2:54:35.400]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[2:54:35.400 --> 2:54:38.440]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[2:54:38.440 --> 2:54:40.840]  I don't think it's that M4s is that good.
[2:54:40.840 --> 2:54:42.200]  I think it's the globalists are that weak.
[2:54:42.200 --> 2:54:45.280]  I'm going to go back to the clinic here in this little segment in the next, then David
[2:54:45.280 --> 2:54:48.160]  Knight's taking over and we're going to have Paul Watson and others coming up in the next
[2:54:48.160 --> 2:54:51.560]  few days in the fourth hour.
[2:54:51.560 --> 2:54:55.640]  I remember we were running some ads through a sponsor that wanted to work with me on some
[2:54:55.640 --> 2:54:59.840]  clear channel, big syndicated shows that have giant audiences and I knew I'd gone on those
[2:54:59.840 --> 2:55:03.760]  shows and plug things and had a big effect.
[2:55:03.760 --> 2:55:12.800]  I mean, I was on, you know, one show, one time George Norris and sold like 20,000 DVDs
[2:55:12.800 --> 2:55:15.720]  with one 30 second plug.
[2:55:15.720 --> 2:55:19.920]  And then I was working with this vitamin mineral company that's great products and they were
[2:55:19.920 --> 2:55:22.680]  running ads and it was having no effect.
[2:55:22.680 --> 2:55:23.680]  Very low.
[2:55:23.680 --> 2:55:26.960]  We did an ad and the first time I had seven times the effect and then every time I ran
[2:55:26.960 --> 2:55:30.840]  the ad was like 30, 40 times the effect by the time and then they're still sponsoring
[2:55:30.840 --> 2:55:33.480]  to this day.
[2:55:33.480 --> 2:55:35.400]  And it's other issues like take clear channel.
[2:55:35.400 --> 2:55:40.640]  I could go on all those stations and have them have warehouses and direct sell high quality
[2:55:40.640 --> 2:55:44.840]  products to people, have the host part of it and make talk radio profitable again.
[2:55:44.840 --> 2:55:46.800]  The executives don't care.
[2:55:46.800 --> 2:55:51.360]  They're just off in their own wonderlands, always looking for some other executive job
[2:55:51.360 --> 2:55:56.680]  they want to move on to when talk radio still ginormous.
[2:55:56.680 --> 2:56:00.520]  It still has huge audiences and then you push that as the infrastructure that's already
[2:56:00.520 --> 2:56:02.880]  there to the internet.
[2:56:02.880 --> 2:56:05.880]  You have the trained personnel already in talk radio and TV.
[2:56:05.880 --> 2:56:10.480]  They're just letting all those people go when that's the huge value of personnel for the
[2:56:10.480 --> 2:56:13.000]  media army to take over.
[2:56:13.000 --> 2:56:14.240]  I'm not even that smart.
[2:56:14.240 --> 2:56:16.240]  These people are morons.
[2:56:16.240 --> 2:56:17.240]  I don't mean George.
[2:56:17.240 --> 2:56:18.240]  He's really smart.
[2:56:18.240 --> 2:56:20.400]  It happened in other cases.
[2:56:20.400 --> 2:56:23.680]  And so that's what I'm talking about is they're just stagnant.
[2:56:23.680 --> 2:56:25.040]  They have no idea.
[2:56:25.040 --> 2:56:26.200]  They're insane.
[2:56:26.200 --> 2:56:27.200]  That's why we're going to beat them.
[2:56:27.200 --> 2:56:29.880]  They may bring me down or Trump down or anybody down.
[2:56:29.880 --> 2:56:31.800]  They're bringing themselves down.
[2:56:31.800 --> 2:56:34.920]  Globalism as we know it, anti-free market, a bunch of billionaires that want to make
[2:56:34.920 --> 2:56:37.560]  everybody else poor, that's not going to sell.
[2:56:37.560 --> 2:56:40.040]  If we promote freedom against that, they'll fall.
[2:56:40.040 --> 2:56:42.520]  I don't care how much money they got, what they're doing.
[2:56:42.520 --> 2:56:44.240]  If we believe in freedom, they're done.
[2:56:44.240 --> 2:56:49.440]  Briefly speaking of that, funder operation, we direct sell to you, high-quality fluoride
[2:56:49.440 --> 2:56:53.680]  free toothpaste, high-quality mouthwash, 10 to 1, the same cost as regular mouthwash,
[2:56:53.680 --> 2:56:54.680]  10 to 1.
[2:56:54.680 --> 2:56:55.680]  10 to 1.
[2:56:55.680 --> 2:56:56.680]  10 times cheaper.
[2:56:56.680 --> 2:57:05.360]  Sign up for auto-ship, 10% off on that, infowarslife.com, triple 8, 2, 5, 3, 3, 1, 3, 9, we got 33% off
[2:57:05.360 --> 2:57:06.360]  on toothpaste right now.
[2:57:06.360 --> 2:57:07.360]  We're going to stop that today.
[2:57:07.360 --> 2:57:09.360]  It's supposed to end yesterday, infowarsstore.com.
[2:57:09.360 --> 2:57:15.840]  I'm not an egomaniac, my ego is invested in humanity, which I guess I'm even bigger
[2:57:15.840 --> 2:57:16.840]  egomaniac then.
[2:57:16.840 --> 2:57:21.360]  My ego is so big, I just associate everything with me, but you're the psychiatrist here.
[2:57:21.360 --> 2:57:25.200]  All I know is we're going to beat these people, we've got a short segment here, another segment
[2:57:25.200 --> 2:57:29.280]  coming up, but it's not that we're even that good, it's that they're that pathetic.
[2:57:29.280 --> 2:57:30.280]  Is that accurate?
[2:57:30.280 --> 2:57:36.680]  Both statements are true, but you are really far better than you understand.
[2:57:36.680 --> 2:57:42.400]  It's not just the fact that who you are, what you've created, and all of the personnel
[2:57:42.400 --> 2:57:48.920]  with you has a leveraging factor that's so great exponentially, you cannot find that
[2:57:48.920 --> 2:57:50.920]  on the main channels or on cable.
[2:57:50.920 --> 2:57:53.000]  Let me give you an example.
[2:57:53.000 --> 2:58:01.200]  The head of Netflix, I assume is a quite competent guy, he just lost $110 billion on one show.
[2:58:01.200 --> 2:58:03.800]  He lost $99 billion on another show.
[2:58:03.800 --> 2:58:06.600]  These are shows directly to Netflix.
[2:58:06.600 --> 2:58:11.760]  They're in trouble, Amazon will be in trouble with content, Hollywood is in trouble with
[2:58:11.760 --> 2:58:14.400]  content, TV is in trouble with content.
[2:58:14.400 --> 2:58:15.400]  Why?
[2:58:15.400 --> 2:58:19.880]  Because there is no content, there are only so many times you can have a Jason Bourne,
[2:58:19.880 --> 2:58:24.480]  there's only so many times you have Jack Ryan, and there are only so many times soldiers
[2:58:24.480 --> 2:58:26.520]  can shoot up a scene.
[2:58:26.520 --> 2:58:32.840]  When Alex Jones comes along and you don't know what the narrative is going to be, it
[2:58:32.840 --> 2:58:35.280]  puts everybody on notice.
[2:58:35.280 --> 2:58:40.000]  So it's a loss of control, and it's not Alex Jones, it's the maverick spirit of America.
[2:58:40.000 --> 2:58:45.440]  We'll be back in 70 seconds to have a genetic finish, and then day to night is taken over.
[2:58:45.440 --> 2:58:49.960]  I want to give us credit, but it's just the maverick spirit is the credit.
[2:58:49.960 --> 2:58:55.960]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality info wars, biome defense
[2:58:55.960 --> 2:58:57.600]  probiotic.
[2:58:57.600 --> 2:59:04.280]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have
[2:59:04.280 --> 2:59:11.960]  been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[2:59:11.960 --> 2:59:16.920]  Biome defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over
[2:59:16.920 --> 2:59:23.600]  23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[2:59:23.600 --> 2:59:28.160]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading
[2:59:28.160 --> 2:59:30.720]  probiotic on the market.
[2:59:30.720 --> 2:59:35.760]  For your biome defense, in ultra strength or regular strength, at infowarslife.com today
[2:59:35.760 --> 2:59:39.360]  and get started supporting your digestive system naturally.
[2:59:39.360 --> 2:59:43.600]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first run to the public,
[2:59:43.600 --> 2:59:55.120]  so please take advantage of it today, support your own health and support the info war.
[2:59:55.120 --> 3:00:07.160]  All right, Alex Jones here back live, fourth hour, David Knight's about to take over.
[3:00:07.160 --> 3:00:10.520]  Let's just fade down this intro to have more time with Dr. Pachennick.
[3:00:10.520 --> 3:00:15.360]  Doc, you're a guy, I mean since we're giving out laurels here, but it shows that you've
[3:00:15.360 --> 3:00:20.480]  been really more accurate than anybody out there with long term projections on my show
[3:00:20.480 --> 3:00:24.840]  eight, nine years ago saying the feds are going to lose power, things will devolve back
[3:00:24.840 --> 3:00:30.800]  to the states, back to the south, back to the Midwest, back to Texas, Americana will
[3:00:30.800 --> 3:00:36.240]  be rediscovered, government will just be obsolete, people are going to ignore it, media is going
[3:00:36.240 --> 3:00:42.480]  to be ignored, that devolution happened, you are accurate, but as a father of four children,
[3:00:42.480 --> 3:00:46.280]  I do this because I have to, but I don't like it, what do we have to worry about, let's
[3:00:46.280 --> 3:00:50.480]  not get too confident here, how is the empire going to strike back and then what are other
[3:00:50.480 --> 3:00:52.320]  trends coming up?
[3:00:52.320 --> 3:00:57.200]  The real major trends for the United States, believe it or not, is going to be water wars,
[3:00:57.200 --> 3:01:02.120]  I wrote about it in state of emergency, I am now engaged in a water war in Bradford
[3:01:02.120 --> 3:01:08.240]  County in Florida, where in fact mining companies like Mosaic are trying to come in and create
[3:01:08.240 --> 3:01:14.400]  phosphate mine and contaminate the Santa Fe River, a lake, and the same thing with other
[3:01:14.400 --> 3:01:19.800]  RV parts that are coming in, so America is going to have a lack of water, you're going
[3:01:19.800 --> 3:01:25.800]  to see that in California, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, and this is going to be one of
[3:01:25.800 --> 3:01:32.480]  the biggest issues, the issue of federal power will devolve, I told you, the FBI is not as
[3:01:32.480 --> 3:01:36.960]  relevant anymore as they thought they once were, what we have that's relevant are the
[3:01:36.960 --> 3:01:43.160]  local police and the local county commissioners and your state governors, the more and more
[3:01:43.160 --> 3:01:48.040]  we devolve power the more important it becomes to really understand how important you have
[3:01:48.040 --> 3:01:50.200]  to be as a member of the community.
[3:01:50.200 --> 3:01:56.480]  You are a Maverick, but you reflect the Maverick quality of Texas, the Southwest of Florida
[3:01:56.480 --> 3:02:01.520]  and all those individuals who had to do it on their own, despite the fact that your family
[3:02:01.520 --> 3:02:07.720]  came from a doctor, an orthodontist, a surgeon, all those elements were irrelevant to the
[3:02:07.720 --> 3:02:15.200]  fact that you went out on your own and created Alex Jones an infant war, so once that happens,
[3:02:15.200 --> 3:02:19.960]  that is the model for our people, in other words, you're not going to depend on a pension,
[3:02:19.960 --> 3:02:26.040]  you're not going to have a steady job anymore, we have what we call a gig economy, GIG, meaning
[3:02:26.040 --> 3:02:31.040]  you're going to go from job to job and you're going to have to figure out among our people
[3:02:31.040 --> 3:02:36.080]  how to create businesses that generate cash, that allow you to have a certain style of
[3:02:36.080 --> 3:02:40.680]  life, but you can't depend on your pensions anymore, you can't depend on the government
[3:02:40.680 --> 3:02:44.840]  to take care of you, every one of you who thinks that there's a pension out there waiting
[3:02:44.840 --> 3:02:49.720]  for you, you better check it very carefully because those pensions are invested in hedge
[3:02:49.720 --> 3:02:55.000]  funds which are doing very poorly on the markets, not because of Trump and not because of any
[3:02:55.000 --> 3:03:00.960]  other issue other than the fact that the hedge funds are becoming antiquated, you can't build
[3:03:00.960 --> 3:03:04.880]  five to 10% out of billions and billions of dollars.
[3:03:04.880 --> 3:03:10.560]  The second thing that's coming in is devolution of power in Europe, I said it years ago that
[3:03:10.560 --> 3:03:15.960]  the Catalan would break away from Spain, and Madrid refuses to let the Catalonians who
[3:03:15.960 --> 3:03:16.960] ...
[3:03:16.960 --> 3:03:20.440]  Yeah, 10 years ago you laid the bricks it up, you said don't worry about the Euro, it's
[3:03:20.440 --> 3:03:21.440]  all a joke.
[3:03:21.440 --> 3:03:26.840]  Correct, and it's still a joke because the only thing holding it up and Trump was right
[3:03:26.840 --> 3:03:33.800]  when he said, I don't like Germany, I don't like Merkel, Merkel knows that she's manipulating
[3:03:33.800 --> 3:03:39.960]  the Euro so that she can make it as the equivalent of the Deutsche Mark, in effect the Germans
[3:03:39.960 --> 3:03:46.280]  have created a dependent relationship on Southern Europe, Spain, Italy, Greece, Greece has defaulted
[3:03:46.280 --> 3:03:52.000]  again for the fourth time, now if we had Puerto Rico defaulting four times, we would say you
[3:03:52.000 --> 3:03:54.360]  know what, we don't want it in a state of it.
[3:03:54.360 --> 3:04:01.240]  The reality is that we as an entity are really becoming redefined along the Southwest Corridor,
[3:04:01.240 --> 3:04:07.200]  the Midwest, the Eastern Coast and the West Coast are really not relevant anymore, shipping
[3:04:07.200 --> 3:04:13.360]  will come in from Florida, New Orleans and around Texas, and that's basically where
[3:04:13.360 --> 3:04:16.560]  you're going to see the engines of the United States.
[3:04:16.560 --> 3:04:21.640]  So the country really is collapsing into the Midwest, into Texas, into Florida and the
[3:04:21.640 --> 3:04:23.600]  Southwest and reorganizing.
[3:04:23.600 --> 3:04:29.200]  Correct, I wouldn't say it was collapsing, I'd say that it was reorganizing because
[3:04:29.200 --> 3:04:34.040]  we are around the major rivers, you're on the Mississippi, we're in Missouri, we have
[3:04:34.040 --> 3:04:39.600]  all the major rivers going down south, and we have the ships coming in, the Panama ships.
[3:04:39.600 --> 3:04:44.160]  Doc, to spend a few minutes, finish your prognosis as a doctor economically for the country, David
[3:04:44.160 --> 3:04:48.440]  Knight's coming in, we'll finish up with you on the other side, cpotrinic.com, I know
[3:04:48.440 --> 3:04:53.640]  this, the globalists aren't powerful, they're having to attack me 24-7, they're on the
[3:04:53.640 --> 3:04:57.000]  street, people aren't buying into it, so a lot of good news is happening, but it's
[3:04:57.000 --> 3:05:00.200]  all because the listeners support us, you are the Info War.
[3:05:00.200 --> 3:05:06.680]  Senator Rand Paul slammed the Democrats yesterday and called the Senate hearings into the collusion
[3:05:06.680 --> 3:05:11.960]  between Trump and Russia nothing more than political theater.
[3:05:11.960 --> 3:05:19.520]  Apparing on CNN, Rand Paul said that the anti-Trumpers have become totally obsessed with proving
[3:05:19.520 --> 3:05:23.440]  a Russian conspiracy that simply does not exist.
[3:05:23.440 --> 3:05:28.240]  This is political theater and really those committees aren't getting anywhere, if there
[3:05:28.240 --> 3:05:32.800]  really was anything done wrong, it'll come out of the special counsel, and my suspicion
[3:05:32.800 --> 3:05:37.480]  is very little of anything will come out of there, but I think there's a political operation
[3:05:37.480 --> 3:05:38.480]  going on.
[3:05:38.480 --> 3:05:44.960]  Rand Paul went on to say that former FBI chief James Comey's testimony completely vindicated
[3:05:44.960 --> 3:05:48.200]  everything the president has already said.
[3:05:48.200 --> 3:05:52.000]  I hardly know the man, I'm not going to say I want you to pledge allegiance, who would
[3:05:52.000 --> 3:05:55.480]  do that, who would ask a man to pledge allegiance under oath?
[3:05:55.480 --> 3:05:59.680]  You can learn more right now at Infowars.com.
[3:05:59.680 --> 3:06:04.040]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[3:06:04.040 --> 3:06:08.760]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[3:06:08.760 --> 3:06:10.280]  to detoxify the body.
[3:06:10.280 --> 3:06:15.160]  That's why I'm introducing Z Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[3:06:15.160 --> 3:06:20.360]  It's made in the USA, it's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely
[3:06:20.360 --> 3:06:23.440]  associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the Info War.
[3:06:23.440 --> 3:06:25.700]  It is a classical 360 win.
[3:06:25.700 --> 3:06:30.200]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe
[3:06:30.200 --> 3:06:34.840]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[3:06:34.840 --> 3:06:35.840]  get.
[3:06:35.840 --> 3:06:39.080]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this
[3:06:39.080 --> 3:06:44.120]  country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[3:06:44.120 --> 3:06:49.340]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[3:06:49.340 --> 3:06:53.200]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be thanks to your support and your
[3:06:53.200 --> 3:06:54.200]  prayers together.
[3:06:54.200 --> 3:06:55.200]  We're changing the world.
[3:06:55.200 --> 3:06:59.400]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z Shield at InfoWarsLife.com.
[3:06:59.400 --> 3:07:03.200]  A new shipment of Biotrucelinium is now available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[3:07:03.200 --> 3:07:04.960]  We've been sold out for months.
[3:07:04.960 --> 3:07:10.080]  Our one-of-a-kind InfoWarsLife Biotrucelinium formula is now back in stock at InfoWarsLife.com.
[3:07:10.080 --> 3:07:13.720]  This is the true selenium formula that has rocked the nutraceutical industry to its
[3:07:13.720 --> 3:07:14.720]  core.
[3:07:14.720 --> 3:07:18.720]  Nearly every other selenium supplement on the market is produced with synthetic selenium.
[3:07:18.720 --> 3:07:23.840]  Biotrucelinium is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[3:07:23.840 --> 3:07:27.360]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are well-known.
[3:07:27.360 --> 3:07:32.360]  From supporting the thyroid gland and immune system to DNA production and eyesight, Biotrucelinium
[3:07:32.360 --> 3:07:37.560]  is also the perfect supercharger to survival shield X2 nascent iodine as both help support
[3:07:37.560 --> 3:07:39.560]  a healthy thyroid and many other systems.
[3:07:39.560 --> 3:07:44.440]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com to order your bottle of Biotrucelinium before we sell out again.
[3:07:44.440 --> 3:07:48.760]  That's InfoWarsLife.com to secure your selenium and other key products that don't only help
[3:07:48.760 --> 3:07:53.520]  yourself and your family, but also fund our operation against the globalist, A360WIN.
[3:07:53.520 --> 3:07:55.640]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight.
[3:07:55.640 --> 3:07:57.160]  This is the time to support InfoWars.
[3:07:57.160 --> 3:08:25.320]  This is InfoWarsLife.com.
[3:08:25.320 --> 3:08:30.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've gotten live coverage out of our other studio at InfoWars.com, and
[3:08:30.760 --> 3:08:32.600]  part of the InfoWars is spreading that link.
[3:08:32.600 --> 3:08:37.400]  Owen Schreuer is in there going over the testimony of Senator Sessions and now Attorney General.
[3:08:37.400 --> 3:08:42.400]  He's saying it's totally false, he's made up attacks, it's all completely ridiculous.
[3:08:42.400 --> 3:08:48.920]  And so let me ask Dr. Steve Pachinic that as he finishes up author, researcher, on what's
[3:08:48.920 --> 3:08:54.200]  happening in this country about how he sees this devolution back to the people, back to
[3:08:54.200 --> 3:08:59.280]  the states that Trump clearly recognizes and is talking about, do you think the Trump administration
[3:08:59.280 --> 3:09:00.280]  can be saved?
[3:09:00.280 --> 3:09:05.200]  I mean, I think overall he's delivered on killing the carbon tax, TPP, a lot of jobs,
[3:09:05.200 --> 3:09:08.400]  the stock market, but they just seem more shrill all the time.
[3:09:08.400 --> 3:09:14.320]  A lot of the public's turning against it, but I think psychologically a lot of the bureaucrats
[3:09:14.320 --> 3:09:17.760]  and some of the deep state people believe they're invincible.
[3:09:17.760 --> 3:09:22.240]  You talked about how a lot of patriots in the deep state helped get Trump elected.
[3:09:22.240 --> 3:09:23.240]  That's admitted now.
[3:09:23.240 --> 3:09:28.000]  I don't know, you know, the juxtaposed, the different positions of the people, but looking
[3:09:28.000 --> 3:09:34.560]  at the battlefield from your perspective and your sources, where is the restoration of
[3:09:34.560 --> 3:09:37.040]  this republic right now?
[3:09:37.040 --> 3:09:40.800]  The restoration of the republic has to be defined in two ways.
[3:09:40.800 --> 3:09:48.280]  What you see with Comey, Mueller, and Ray, these three, what I call White-Angela Saxon,
[3:09:48.280 --> 3:09:54.200]  the elite of the wasp who went to Yale, Princeton, William and Mary, these are process people.
[3:09:54.200 --> 3:09:59.280]  These are people who go to the jury, they go to write papers, they don't create anything
[3:09:59.280 --> 3:10:00.560]  that's substantive.
[3:10:00.560 --> 3:10:04.600]  In contrast, Trump put up two men who are very quiet.
[3:10:04.600 --> 3:10:06.120]  You don't hear very much about them.
[3:10:06.120 --> 3:10:08.060]  They're the multi-billionaires.
[3:10:08.060 --> 3:10:11.240]  One is Roth and the other one's LeFrak.
[3:10:11.240 --> 3:10:19.040]  Both are famous multi-billionaires who've created major, major installations in complexes,
[3:10:19.040 --> 3:10:25.800]  industrial complexes, apartment houses, and construction sites in New Jersey, Long Island,
[3:10:25.800 --> 3:10:26.800]  and Queens.
[3:10:26.800 --> 3:10:31.800]  So, what we have here now is the beginning of the end of the process, which was heightened
[3:10:31.800 --> 3:10:38.280]  by Obama, and we're now going into the reality of building structures, infrastructure, building
[3:10:38.280 --> 3:10:46.280]  up our towns, our cities, our counties, and starting to care about where America is locally.
[3:10:46.280 --> 3:10:51.280]  We don't care as much about what's happening overseas because Mattis will take care of
[3:10:51.280 --> 3:10:53.960]  that, Tillerson has to take care of that.
[3:10:53.960 --> 3:10:59.720]  But the reality right now is that Trump is focused very much on what Roth and LeFrak
[3:10:59.720 --> 3:11:00.720]  are doing.
[3:11:00.720 --> 3:11:06.040]  And wouldn't you say he's delivering because Trump is obsessed with true economic real
[3:11:06.040 --> 3:11:12.880]  world and is delivering, and he just, I guess, thinks that that will defeat the made up garbage
[3:11:12.880 --> 3:11:17.240]  and theater and hysteria being put out by the Republican and Democratic establishment?
[3:11:17.240 --> 3:11:21.840]  I mean, I don't know how anybody could be complaining so far when Trump got so much
[3:11:21.840 --> 3:11:22.840]  done.
[3:11:22.840 --> 3:11:26.840]  He had that cabinet meeting yesterday and everybody from each cabinet department announced
[3:11:26.840 --> 3:11:30.520]  the successes they'd had, and the media made fun of it and said, look at the cheerleading
[3:11:30.520 --> 3:11:31.920]  session he just had.
[3:11:31.920 --> 3:11:36.400]  What they get, that if we don't get confidence up, we're going to go into the depression.
[3:11:36.400 --> 3:11:41.200]  I mean, watching the establishment cheerlead against our economy and against everybody's
[3:11:41.200 --> 3:11:45.240]  401Ks really angers me, Dr. Pachennick, and then jump in tonight.
[3:11:45.240 --> 3:11:48.520]  Well, again, it's the issue of Andy.
[3:11:48.520 --> 3:11:53.000]  It's the issue of the fact that people really don't understand how the business of business
[3:11:53.000 --> 3:11:54.000]  works.
[3:11:54.000 --> 3:11:58.920]  You come in, you fire people, you put in people in place without spending too much time.
[3:11:58.920 --> 3:12:03.200]  You don't go into meetings, you don't put it quite frankly, you don't bullshit.
[3:12:03.200 --> 3:12:04.200]  You get things done.
[3:12:04.200 --> 3:12:09.920]  And the only two concerns that people like myself or you or LeFrac and Roth have is,
[3:12:09.920 --> 3:12:11.280]  is it coming on time?
[3:12:11.280 --> 3:12:12.440]  Is it under budget?
[3:12:12.440 --> 3:12:13.520]  That's it.
[3:12:13.520 --> 3:12:17.600]  But in the process of Washington, it's totally irrelevant those two questions.
[3:12:17.600 --> 3:12:21.760]  And what you have, in fact, is process overtaking substance.
[3:12:21.760 --> 3:12:25.040]  But those days are gone now because we don't have money for it.
[3:12:25.040 --> 3:12:27.620]  We don't have a capacity to handle them anymore.
[3:12:27.620 --> 3:12:29.000]  We have to focus in on it.
[3:12:29.000 --> 3:12:32.440]  So we've got Mueller and them trying to block the president while he's trying to jumpstart
[3:12:32.440 --> 3:12:37.440]  the economy with defibrillators, running around rearranging deck chairs in the Titanic, battling
[3:12:37.440 --> 3:12:41.480]  the president as he just tries to steer us around the iceberg field.
[3:12:41.480 --> 3:12:46.040]  It's so obvious, the American people, that the Democratic Party and others and the Republican
[3:12:46.040 --> 3:12:47.600]  establishment are committing sepico.
[3:12:47.600 --> 3:12:53.720]  I mean, they are just a bunch of hysterical babies that want to claim their in power vestigially
[3:12:53.720 --> 3:12:55.480]  through a power structure.
[3:12:55.480 --> 3:12:58.760]  Even though they're not, they want to imagine they're in control.
[3:12:58.760 --> 3:13:01.080]  And they're actually pissed that America's coming back.
[3:13:01.080 --> 3:13:02.360]  Here's an example of this.
[3:13:02.360 --> 3:13:06.400]  Let's contrast what they did with Cylindra, because that's a renewable energy source,
[3:13:06.400 --> 3:13:07.400]  right?
[3:13:07.400 --> 3:13:11.560]  Total scam should have been investigated by the FBI, but it wasn't, versus getting the
[3:13:11.560 --> 3:13:14.200]  government off the back of the coal miners.
[3:13:14.200 --> 3:13:18.080]  And so we had this report that came out, Trump tweeted it, hey, look, we've got a coal mine
[3:13:18.080 --> 3:13:20.320]  opening up, a new coal mine opening up.
[3:13:20.320 --> 3:13:24.840]  And when I looked at Trump's tweet, a guy at the top had said, well, there's more people
[3:13:24.840 --> 3:13:27.120]  employed by Arby's than there are by the coal industry.
[3:13:27.120 --> 3:13:30.560]  And I said, well, that's because Hillary and Obama never tried to shut down Arby's.
[3:13:30.560 --> 3:13:34.520]  They are trying to shut down beef supply, but they never tried to shut that.
[3:13:34.520 --> 3:13:36.640]  And coal sold to the world.
[3:13:36.640 --> 3:13:39.400]  Coal is a platform like oxygen.
[3:13:39.400 --> 3:13:40.400]  Exactly.
[3:13:40.400 --> 3:13:43.240]  Coal gives us steel and strength and energy.
[3:13:43.240 --> 3:13:44.240]  Arby's gives us diabetes.
[3:13:44.240 --> 3:13:46.440]  I might try to attack Arby's, but-
[3:13:46.440 --> 3:13:47.440]  What gives us energy?
[3:13:47.440 --> 3:13:48.440]  The other one gives us gas.
[3:13:48.440 --> 3:13:49.440]  But you know what?
[3:13:49.440 --> 3:13:54.160]  The thing is, is that it's a difference between getting the government off the back of people
[3:13:54.160 --> 3:13:58.000]  and allowing them to create versus determining that you're going to shut down no matter
[3:13:58.000 --> 3:13:59.000]  what they do.
[3:13:59.000 --> 3:14:00.480]  You're going to shut down the coal industry.
[3:14:00.480 --> 3:14:02.520]  You could clean it up or whatever, but you're not-
[3:14:02.520 --> 3:14:06.680]  Which means they're declaring they're going to annihilate like Nazi Germany.
[3:14:06.680 --> 3:14:09.160]  This group today, that group tomorrow, and now it's industries.
[3:14:09.160 --> 3:14:11.320]  You can have a coal plant, but we're going to bankrupt you.
[3:14:11.320 --> 3:14:14.120]  It's just these, it's this arbitrary command and control.
[3:14:14.120 --> 3:14:15.520]  And they do it because of crony capitalism.
[3:14:15.520 --> 3:14:18.560]  They do it because they wanted to feed their friends who had cylindra.
[3:14:18.560 --> 3:14:19.560]  It's crooked.
[3:14:19.560 --> 3:14:21.640]  And that's what the Paris Agreement was about.
[3:14:21.640 --> 3:14:22.960]  It's about crony capitalism.
[3:14:22.960 --> 3:14:23.960]  It didn't have anything.
[3:14:23.960 --> 3:14:26.560]  You don't even have to debate the science on this.
[3:14:26.560 --> 3:14:27.560]  Exactly.
[3:14:27.560 --> 3:14:28.560]  Let me ask you this.
[3:14:28.560 --> 3:14:29.560]  You're taking over to host the rest of the show.
[3:14:29.560 --> 3:14:31.360]  Let me ask you in the next pochetic and closing.
[3:14:31.360 --> 3:14:33.560]  What do we do to defeat these people?
[3:14:33.560 --> 3:14:36.280]  What do we do to make sure we're in their face?
[3:14:36.280 --> 3:14:37.280]  What do we do to make sure?
[3:14:37.280 --> 3:14:41.240]  I mean, I'm expanding info wars, but I'm just, you know, info wars.
[3:14:41.240 --> 3:14:42.240]  What does the audience do?
[3:14:42.240 --> 3:14:45.560]  I got support us, but larger than that, they should call C-SPAN.
[3:14:45.560 --> 3:14:46.680]  They should call talk radio.
[3:14:46.680 --> 3:14:47.680]  They should start a blog.
[3:14:47.680 --> 3:14:52.400]  I mean, what do we do in the info war, David Knight, Steve Pochetic, to really make sure
[3:14:52.400 --> 3:14:54.120]  we expose these scoundrels?
[3:14:54.120 --> 3:14:58.280]  Well, we don't allow them to shut us down by calling us a conspiracy theorist.
[3:14:58.280 --> 3:15:03.680]  Every time we question the official government story, their pat reply is to yell conspiracy
[3:15:03.680 --> 3:15:04.680]  theorist.
[3:15:04.680 --> 3:15:07.760]  In the same way that when you show up at one of these rallies, if you have some, if you
[3:15:07.760 --> 3:15:10.560]  got a Trump sign, they immediately call you racist, sexist, homophobic.
[3:15:10.560 --> 3:15:11.560]  We just call their bluff.
[3:15:11.560 --> 3:15:12.560]  Yeah.
[3:15:12.560 --> 3:15:13.560]  So we just call their bluff.
[3:15:13.560 --> 3:15:14.560]  It's just a label.
[3:15:14.560 --> 3:15:15.560]  We don't really care.
[3:15:15.560 --> 3:15:17.120]  And we're going to continue to look at the information.
[3:15:17.120 --> 3:15:18.120]  And they're getting more shrill.
[3:15:18.120 --> 3:15:19.120]  Yeah.
[3:15:19.120 --> 3:15:23.000]  I mean, Dr. Pochetic, you're a psychiatrist, I mean, the shrillness, the hysteria.
[3:15:23.000 --> 3:15:27.120]  It's like drunken toddlers running around beating people up.
[3:15:27.120 --> 3:15:28.120]  Yeah.
[3:15:28.120 --> 3:15:30.120]  I mean, what does this signify to you?
[3:15:30.120 --> 3:15:35.360]  What I signify is, again, what I'm telling you is the toddlers either drowning or he's
[3:15:35.360 --> 3:15:37.560]  suffocating in his crib.
[3:15:37.560 --> 3:15:40.640]  And the answer was we've talked about it for quite a while.
[3:15:40.640 --> 3:15:47.120]  What you're seeing is the death throes of the end of the mainstream media, the political
[3:15:47.120 --> 3:15:48.120]  parties.
[3:15:48.120 --> 3:15:54.880]  You have done, David, you, a group of others, Steve Quayle, we all started an alternative
[3:15:54.880 --> 3:16:00.560]  dialogue and narrative that they cannot shut down, nor do they understand it.
[3:16:00.560 --> 3:16:05.960]  And at this point, all they're doing is throwing mud balls and it has no effect whatsoever.
[3:16:05.960 --> 3:16:09.720]  We just so as a psychiatrist that predicted there's a psychological warfare expert for
[3:16:09.720 --> 3:16:12.160]  the Pentagon State Department, you name it.
[3:16:12.160 --> 3:16:16.360]  What do you expect in closing the next shoe to drop in the insane toddler meltdown?
[3:16:16.360 --> 3:16:22.520]  Well, they're going to try and impeachment narrative and impeachment scenario against
[3:16:22.520 --> 3:16:24.560]  Trump, and it's not going to work.
[3:16:24.560 --> 3:16:29.200]  And then they're going to mock Trump again, and that's not going to work.
[3:16:29.200 --> 3:16:34.440]  And at the same time, foreign countries will try to align with different elements of the
[3:16:34.440 --> 3:16:42.680]  Democratic Party to, in a way, to impair Trump or inhibit him from executing what he needs
[3:16:42.680 --> 3:16:44.280]  to do on foreign policy.
[3:16:44.280 --> 3:16:49.920]  But remember, we're focused in, not as isolationists, we're focused in on the United States, the
[3:16:49.920 --> 3:16:50.920]  devolution of power.
[3:16:50.920 --> 3:16:52.880]  Yeah, we're not going to sell out America anymore.
[3:16:52.880 --> 3:16:56.280]  Dr. Pachennick, StevePachennick.com, folks can find your latest books there.
[3:16:56.280 --> 3:16:57.280]  Thank you so much for the time.
[3:16:57.280 --> 3:16:58.280]  Thank you.
[3:16:58.280 --> 3:16:59.280]  Thank you, gentlemen.
[3:16:59.280 --> 3:17:00.280]  Have a good day.
[3:17:00.280 --> 3:17:01.280]  Thank you.
[3:17:01.280 --> 3:17:02.280]  I mean, you can say what you want about Trump.
[3:17:02.280 --> 3:17:03.680]  He really is the American president.
[3:17:03.680 --> 3:17:06.840]  He really is saying no more one-sided deals selling on our infrastructure.
[3:17:06.840 --> 3:17:08.760]  He wants to do deals that are two-way.
[3:17:08.760 --> 3:17:13.520]  He's not even against China or Mexico or anybody, and I know you're taking over here in a moment
[3:17:13.520 --> 3:17:14.520]  just briefly.
[3:17:14.520 --> 3:17:16.160]  Listeners, we are successful.
[3:17:16.160 --> 3:17:17.360]  We are having a big effect.
[3:17:17.360 --> 3:17:18.360]  David Knight's coming up.
[3:17:18.360 --> 3:17:25.520]  We've got infowars.com coverage of the hearings in Congress with Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
[3:17:25.520 --> 3:17:26.520]  That's going on right now.
[3:17:26.520 --> 3:17:29.680]  As you can see, they're on the camera shot over our shoulder.
[3:17:29.680 --> 3:17:34.120]  But before David takes over, without you buying products at InfoWars store, we're dead in
[3:17:34.120 --> 3:17:35.620]  the water.
[3:17:35.620 --> 3:17:40.240]  That's our main funding mechanism, and we've got high-quality fluoride-free toothpaste with
[3:17:40.240 --> 3:17:42.840]  iodine with colloidal silver, something I thought people would love.
[3:17:42.840 --> 3:17:44.080]  You have loved it.
[3:17:44.080 --> 3:17:46.600]  It's got thousands of reviews, 4.8 reviews.

[3:17:48.560 --> 3:17:50.560]  That's got to stop today.

[3:18:05.960 --> 3:18:10.720]  We've got deep-free herbal bug spray cream that works really well.
[3:18:10.720 --> 3:18:16.760]  We've got pure unscented body wash, pure tea tree shampoo, long-lasting natural deodorant,

[3:18:44.720 --> 3:18:50.360]  that really makes the broadcast possible 5.0 reviews on that combo pack.
[3:18:50.360 --> 3:18:55.040]  Again, we don't make big profits on these, so it takes big bulk, but I think, man, I'm
[3:18:55.040 --> 3:18:57.120]  already using great organic shampoo.
[3:18:57.120 --> 3:19:00.000]  Let's see if we can get this company or that company to let us private label.
[3:19:00.000 --> 3:19:05.120]  We did, and so you're getting something, if you do the auto-ship, 45% off when you count
[3:19:05.120 --> 3:19:10.360]  the 20% off store prices, 45% off what you can get at the store for, and you're supporting
[3:19:10.360 --> 3:19:13.880]  the InfoWare, but it takes massive volume to fund the operation.
[3:19:13.880 --> 3:19:16.640]  We've got Brainforce, our great new tropic.

[3:19:31.680 --> 3:19:35.160]  against the globalists and their boycotts and their attacks and their demonization.
[3:19:35.160 --> 3:19:40.120]  So this is a key fight in the movement to expose the New World Order and defend the restoration
[3:19:40.120 --> 3:19:44.640]  of our republic and the planet towards a freedom-based algorithm.
[3:19:44.640 --> 3:19:48.280]  David Knight's taking over in T-minus four minutes on the other side.

[3:21:01.160 --> 3:21:07.280]  I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already
[3:21:07.280 --> 3:21:12.600]  trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic
[3:21:12.600 --> 3:21:13.600]  and high quality.

[3:21:27.200 --> 3:21:28.200]  It is an answer to prayer.
[3:21:28.200 --> 3:21:32.160]  And because we're cutting out the middleman, 20% off retail, sign up for auto-ship, an

[3:24:28.200 --> 3:24:33.200]  We have testimony from Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and of course last week we had
[3:24:33.200 --> 3:24:38.840]  testimony from James Comey, former FBI Director before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence
[3:24:38.840 --> 3:24:44.720]  that Sessions was silent when Comey told him about his concerns with meeting Trump alone.
[3:24:44.720 --> 3:24:49.080]  Now, Comey is going to contradict that part of the testimony, he's going to say that's
[3:24:49.080 --> 3:24:50.320]  absolutely not true.
[3:24:50.320 --> 3:24:56.160]  He said that he told Comey that the DOJ and the FBI need to be careful about following
[3:24:56.160 --> 3:24:59.200]  appropriate policies regarding contacts with the White House.
[3:24:59.200 --> 3:25:04.120]  But if you watched the hearings last week, you also know that the Democrat senators kept
[3:25:04.120 --> 3:25:10.440]  asking questions about Sessions, and of course that could not be answered by trying to incriminate
[3:25:10.440 --> 3:25:14.560]  him, trying to imply that there was something wrong, trying to talk about other meetings
[3:25:14.560 --> 3:25:16.800]  with the Russian ambassador.
[3:25:16.800 --> 3:25:18.840]  And they call for this testimony today to be public.
[3:25:18.840 --> 3:25:22.760]  They said if you make it private, Sessions wanted to talk about this in private, they
[3:25:22.760 --> 3:25:27.720]  said if you make it private, we're going to leak the information, and then we will call
[3:25:27.720 --> 3:25:28.720]  for a public hearing.
[3:25:28.720 --> 3:25:32.640]  So they threatened to leak the information out of a private hearing, and they actually
[3:25:32.640 --> 3:25:38.200]  did leak information from last week's private hearing when Comey talked to them after the
[3:25:38.200 --> 3:25:39.200]  public testimony.
[3:25:39.200 --> 3:25:40.880]  They actually already leaked that information.
[3:25:40.880 --> 3:25:46.680]  They said, well, Comey told us that Sessions had a third undisclosed meeting with Russian
[3:25:46.680 --> 3:25:52.120]  ambassador Sergei Kizlak, and that has been denied by the Justice Department spokeswoman
[3:25:52.120 --> 3:25:53.120]  Flores.
[3:25:53.120 --> 3:25:56.560]  She's denied that this meeting ever happened at the Mayflower Hotel in D.C. following a
[3:25:56.560 --> 3:26:00.800]  speech that President Trump gave during the campaign.
[3:26:00.800 --> 3:26:06.480]  Now as they try to say that talking to these, that the transition team of Trump, talking
[3:26:06.480 --> 3:26:11.560]  to the Russian ambassador, talking to foreign dignitaries, that that was somehow a violation
[3:26:11.560 --> 3:26:14.800]  of the Logan actor, that was somehow conspiracy with the Russians.
[3:26:14.800 --> 3:26:15.800]  That absolutely isn't true.
[3:26:15.800 --> 3:26:19.600]  As an example of that, this story from the Daily Caller confirmed Obama had his own back
[3:26:19.600 --> 3:26:22.080]  channel to Moscow.
[3:26:22.080 --> 3:26:24.080]  These are the words of Bloomberg.
[3:26:24.080 --> 3:26:30.040]  They said in October two people said the White House contacted the Kremlin on the back channel
[3:26:30.040 --> 3:26:34.520]  to offer detailed documents of what it said was Russia's role in election meddling and
[3:26:34.520 --> 3:26:37.520]  to warn that the attacks risk setting off a broader conflict.
[3:26:37.520 --> 3:26:42.760]  So it's not a problem if Obama has a back channel, but it is a problem if anybody in
[3:26:42.760 --> 3:26:44.840]  the White House were to talk about that secretly.
[3:26:44.840 --> 3:26:49.940]  Meanwhile, we had Judge Napolitano say that this is a very dangerous game that they're
[3:26:49.940 --> 3:26:51.440]  engaged in here.
[3:26:51.440 --> 3:26:57.160]  Newt Gingrich came out and talked about how Bob Mueller is not neutral, and we'll talk
[3:26:57.160 --> 3:26:59.240]  about that in a moment here.
[3:26:59.240 --> 3:27:02.200]  Talking about the connections of the special prosecutors with many people in the Hillary
[3:27:02.200 --> 3:27:03.800]  Clinton camp.
[3:27:03.800 --> 3:27:07.120]  But Judge Napolitano said prosecutors are not neutral.
[3:27:07.120 --> 3:27:08.440]  They prosecute people.
[3:27:08.440 --> 3:27:11.320]  He understands that this isn't an investigation.
[3:27:11.320 --> 3:27:13.640]  This is a prosecution.
[3:27:13.640 --> 3:27:17.240]  Bring me the man and I'll find the crime type of prosecution, the kind of prosecution we
[3:27:17.240 --> 3:27:20.080]  saw in Stalinist Russia.
[3:27:20.080 --> 3:27:24.760]  Judge Napolitano went on to say they believe that their targets are guilty and they mass
[3:27:24.760 --> 3:27:27.000]  evidence to justify that belief.
[3:27:27.000 --> 3:27:28.000]  That is what they do.
[3:27:28.000 --> 3:27:33.680]  He says, I'm telling Newt Gingrich that this is no different from any other prosecution.
[3:27:33.680 --> 3:27:37.000]  The whole country, particularly those of us in this business, want it to be public so
[3:27:37.000 --> 3:27:41.960]  we can witness what he's going to say, but this is a very dangerous position for him
[3:27:41.960 --> 3:27:42.960]  to be in.
[3:27:42.960 --> 3:27:48.240]  He is testifying as a witness because he doesn't run the Russian investigations.
[3:27:48.240 --> 3:27:50.000]  He is a witness.
[3:27:50.000 --> 3:27:51.520]  He has involvement in both.
[3:27:51.520 --> 3:27:55.680]  He's going to be accused of perjury and he's going to come to a conflict point where he
[3:27:55.680 --> 3:27:56.680]  has to decide.
[3:27:56.680 --> 3:27:59.400]  See, here's the situation.
[3:27:59.400 --> 3:28:05.200]  We've had James Comey and I'm surprised at how silent all the media is.
[3:28:05.200 --> 3:28:10.720]  And I'm even talking about people who typically look at this from a, because let's understand,
[3:28:10.720 --> 3:28:11.720]  everybody's partisan.
[3:28:11.720 --> 3:28:15.200]  Okay, let's not pretend that there's any objective media.
[3:28:15.200 --> 3:28:16.200]  Fly your flag.
[3:28:16.200 --> 3:28:18.720]  Let people know where you're coming from and support your position.
[3:28:18.720 --> 3:28:20.600]  That's the only way to do honest journalism.
[3:28:20.600 --> 3:28:27.480]  If you come out there and say, I have no dog in this, I have no opinion in this, that's
[3:28:27.480 --> 3:28:28.480]  a lie.
[3:28:28.480 --> 3:28:29.480]  That's a lie.
[3:28:29.480 --> 3:28:32.480]  Anybody that believes that is a fool, including the person who says it.
[3:28:32.480 --> 3:28:36.000]  So if you believe that and you're in the news business, you're a fool.
[3:28:36.000 --> 3:28:42.320]  Because the stories that you pick to talk about reflect your opinion, your political bias,
[3:28:42.320 --> 3:28:44.720]  what the point of view that you're coming from.
[3:28:44.720 --> 3:28:49.080]  And so we have a press that is going to support Trump, we have a press that's going to attack
[3:28:49.080 --> 3:28:50.680]  Trump.
[3:28:50.680 --> 3:28:53.120]  And so the various stories that you pick are going to show that.
[3:28:53.120 --> 3:28:58.120]  But when we have the press that typically is going to support Trump, I'm surprised at
[3:28:58.120 --> 3:29:02.040]  how silent they've been on the perjury of James Comey.
[3:29:02.040 --> 3:29:08.120]  This is a guy who under oath first said, nobody ever pressured me to shut down an investigation
[3:29:08.120 --> 3:29:09.120]  politically.
[3:29:09.120 --> 3:29:10.120]  Never.
[3:29:10.120 --> 3:29:12.120]  If they did, that would be a big deal.
[3:29:12.120 --> 3:29:15.920]  Well, it should be a big deal when he comes back and said, no, no, I understood him to
[3:29:15.920 --> 3:29:17.800]  be telling me to shut down this investigation.
[3:29:17.800 --> 3:29:18.800]  He said, hope.
[3:29:18.800 --> 3:29:24.600]  But I understood that was done in the same sense that King Henry II said, I hope somebody
[3:29:24.600 --> 3:29:26.480]  will rid me of this turbulent priest.
[3:29:26.480 --> 3:29:28.880]  And so they got the hint and they killed him.
[3:29:28.880 --> 3:29:32.040]  What he was saying was he was prevaricating his language.
[3:29:32.040 --> 3:29:35.920]  You know, the person who's prevaricating in their language is James Comey.
[3:29:35.920 --> 3:29:39.440]  And he came out and said, I was pressured in so many words, he said, I was pressured
[3:29:39.440 --> 3:29:40.440]  to shut this down.
[3:29:40.440 --> 3:29:41.940]  He's the one who committed perjury.
[3:29:41.940 --> 3:29:42.940]  He won't.
[3:29:42.940 --> 3:29:43.940]  Nothing will happen to him.
[3:29:43.940 --> 3:29:47.880]  Even the libertarian conservative press won't say that, but they will come, everybody will
[3:29:47.880 --> 3:29:48.880]  come after Jeff Sessions.
[3:29:48.880 --> 3:29:49.880]  We're on the march.
[3:29:49.880 --> 3:29:50.880]  A contradiction.
[3:29:50.880 --> 3:30:00.320]  The empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[3:30:00.320 --> 3:30:06.800]  Senator Rand Paul slammed the Democrats yesterday and called the Senate hearings into the collusion
[3:30:06.800 --> 3:30:12.080]  between Trump and Russia, nothing more than political theater.
[3:30:12.080 --> 3:30:19.600]  Apparing on CNN, Rand Paul said that the anti-Trumpers have become totally obsessed with proving
[3:30:19.600 --> 3:30:23.600]  a Russian conspiracy that simply does not exist.
[3:30:23.600 --> 3:30:28.040]  This is political theater and really those committees aren't getting anywhere.
[3:30:28.040 --> 3:30:31.560]  If there really was anything done wrong, it'll come out of the special counsel.
[3:30:31.560 --> 3:30:34.840]  And my suspicion is very little of anything will come out of there.
[3:30:34.840 --> 3:30:38.400]  But I think there's a political operation going on.
[3:30:38.400 --> 3:30:45.120]  Rand Paul went on to say that former FBI chief James Comey's testimony completely vindicated
[3:30:45.120 --> 3:30:48.400]  everything the president has already said.
[3:30:48.400 --> 3:30:49.400]  I hardly know the man.
[3:30:49.400 --> 3:30:51.400]  I'm not going to say I want you to pledge allegiance.
[3:30:51.400 --> 3:30:52.400]  Who would do that?
[3:30:52.400 --> 3:30:55.640]  Who would ask a man to pledge allegiance under oath?

[3:31:03.160 --> 3:31:08.280]  I'm also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the
[3:31:08.280 --> 3:31:09.280]  planet.
[3:31:09.280 --> 3:31:12.840]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[3:31:12.840 --> 3:31:17.200]  Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[3:31:17.200 --> 3:31:22.520]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[3:31:34.040 --> 3:31:36.160]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[3:31:36.160 --> 3:31:40.480]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections
[3:31:40.480 --> 3:31:43.200]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.

[3:32:30.320 --> 3:32:31.320]  It's amazing.
[3:32:31.320 --> 3:32:35.320]  I drank it in the morning, and I swear to you, I felt incredible, like I haven't felt
[3:32:35.320 --> 3:32:36.320]  sweet.
[3:32:36.320 --> 3:32:42.040]  My morning was fantastic, and I love you guys, I love the InfoWars true, and I just want
[3:32:42.040 --> 3:32:46.560]  to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence
[3:32:46.560 --> 3:32:47.560]  just buy it.
[3:32:47.560 --> 3:32:48.560]  You will love it.
[3:32:48.560 --> 3:32:50.560]  I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.
[3:32:50.560 --> 3:32:55.400]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfowarsLife.com.
[3:32:55.400 --> 3:32:57.400]  It's a win-win at infowarslife.com.
[3:33:25.400 --> 3:33:30.680]  We're going to talk about the jeopardy that Jeff Sessions is putting himself in as he
[3:33:30.680 --> 3:33:34.040]  testifies at this point, because they're looking for a process crime with him.
[3:33:34.040 --> 3:33:35.400]  They're looking for perjury.
[3:33:35.400 --> 3:33:39.760]  While they ignore Comey's perjury, and I'm going to talk to you about how dirty Comey
[3:33:39.760 --> 3:33:41.840]  is here in just a moment.
[3:33:41.840 --> 3:33:47.480]  But as we see this third allegation that came out, of course, it was in a closed hearing.
[3:33:47.480 --> 3:33:48.960]  The Democrats leaked it.
[3:33:48.960 --> 3:33:53.520]  Comey alleged that Sessions had met a third time with a Russian ambassador.
[3:33:53.520 --> 3:33:58.640]  So we've got these back channels, and as I just reported to you, Obama set up back channels
[3:33:58.640 --> 3:34:00.680]  with the Russians himself.
[3:34:00.680 --> 3:34:02.440]  So they do talk to Russia.
[3:34:02.440 --> 3:34:06.880]  It's very important to talk to somebody that has a massive nuclear arsenal, rather than
[3:34:06.880 --> 3:34:12.120]  continuing to poke them so that we can revive a Cold War, which is what the Obama administration,
[3:34:12.120 --> 3:34:13.360]  Hillary Clinton, did.
[3:34:13.360 --> 3:34:17.120]  They want to revive that Cold War for the military industrial complex that just doesn't
[3:34:17.120 --> 3:34:21.800]  make enough money if they aren't selling long-range bombers and intercontinental ballistic missiles.
[3:34:21.800 --> 3:34:25.200]  We need to up the ante on the military spending here.
[3:34:25.200 --> 3:34:29.880]  So it's necessary to have that, even if it brings us to the brink or into a nuclear war.
[3:34:29.880 --> 3:34:30.960]  That doesn't matter.
[3:34:30.960 --> 3:34:34.200]  We got to serve the interests of the military industrial complex.
[3:34:34.200 --> 3:34:38.080]  And of course, the Democrats, who are always anti-war, just play along with this because
[3:34:38.080 --> 3:34:40.240]  it's political theater for them.
[3:34:40.240 --> 3:34:46.080]  Now, as they were saying in some of Sessions' staff said, spokesperson for the Justice Department
[3:34:46.080 --> 3:34:48.040]  denied that meeting.
[3:34:48.040 --> 3:34:51.780]  They said, we want to have an open meeting today with Senator Sessions.
[3:34:51.780 --> 3:34:57.000]  We want to get him in public because if you put it in private, we're going to leak that
[3:34:57.000 --> 3:34:58.000]  information.
[3:34:58.000 --> 3:34:59.920]  And then we're going to have a public hearing in addition.
[3:34:59.920 --> 3:35:03.240]  And we already know that they'll leak the information because they leaked the false allegation
[3:35:03.240 --> 3:35:07.200]  from Comey from the private meeting last week to put pressure on him.
[3:35:07.200 --> 3:35:11.040]  But he says he did not meet a third time with the Russian ambassador.
[3:35:11.040 --> 3:35:14.400]  And his staffers have acknowledged that he met twice with Russian ambassador Sergei
[3:35:14.400 --> 3:35:15.400]  Kozlak.
[3:35:15.400 --> 3:35:21.640]  They said he did not mislead Congress because the encounters are part of his job as a senator,
[3:35:21.640 --> 3:35:23.800]  senators do this all the time.
[3:35:23.800 --> 3:35:25.440]  There's nothing criminal about that.
[3:35:25.440 --> 3:35:27.720]  He did not do it as a Trump surrogate.
[3:35:27.720 --> 3:35:32.960]  Meanwhile, we see that CNN cuts the feed after a senator objects the Clinton Foundation
[3:35:32.960 --> 3:35:36.960]  attorney joining the independent, quote, unquote, independent council.
[3:35:36.960 --> 3:35:42.120]  So CNN cut away from, this is the story from Breitbart, CNN cut away from a Senate Judiciary
[3:35:42.120 --> 3:35:47.360]  Committee hearing on Tuesday morning, seconds after Senator Lindsey Graham raised concerns
[3:35:47.360 --> 3:35:52.080]  that a special counsel, the special counsel Robert Mueller had hired a former Clinton
[3:35:52.080 --> 3:35:57.960]  Foundation attorney to assist with the probe into alleged Russian interference in the 2016
[3:35:57.960 --> 3:35:58.960]  presidential election.
[3:35:58.960 --> 3:36:03.080]  And of course, this was what Newt Gingrich was very upset about.
[3:36:03.080 --> 3:36:08.440]  It's what we had the reaction of Judge Apollotano to react to what Newt Gingrich said.
[3:36:08.440 --> 3:36:13.320]  Newt Gingrich had a mini meltdown, as it's reported by Breitbart in the media Monday
[3:36:13.320 --> 3:36:17.760]  with a tweet challenging the fairness of the investigation in the Russian interference
[3:36:17.760 --> 3:36:19.560]  of the 2016 presidential election.
[3:36:19.560 --> 3:36:21.920]  He said, Republicans are delusional.
[3:36:21.920 --> 3:36:26.080]  If they think the special counsel is going to be fair, look who he is hiring.
[3:36:26.080 --> 3:36:28.040]  Check the FEC reports.
[3:36:28.040 --> 3:36:31.160]  It's time to rethink this, in other words, the federal election commissions.
[3:36:31.160 --> 3:36:33.640]  And so we have, and many people have done that.
[3:36:33.640 --> 3:36:39.600]  There's three members of this special counsel team, the independent team that's going to
[3:36:39.600 --> 3:36:40.760]  investigate this.
[3:36:40.760 --> 3:36:44.440]  We have three members of the legal team hired by special counsel Robert Mueller to investigate
[3:36:44.440 --> 3:36:50.200]  the Trump campaign's alleged ties to Russia, overwhelmingly donated to Democrats, according
[3:36:50.200 --> 3:36:54.360]  to analysis of the federal election commission records, the three attorneys collectively
[3:36:54.360 --> 3:37:01.520]  made over $53,000 in political campaign contributions to Democrats since 1998, with over half of
[3:37:01.520 --> 3:37:05.120]  those contributions coming from one attorney, Quarles.
[3:37:05.120 --> 3:37:09.840]  He was selected by Mueller from his old law firm, Wilmer Hale.
[3:37:09.840 --> 3:37:15.760]  So this is the kind of collusion, the swamp is now going to do an independent investigation
[3:37:15.760 --> 3:37:18.480]  of Donald Trump, absolutely.
[3:37:18.480 --> 3:37:21.880]  And that's what we had Judge Napolitano responding to.
[3:37:21.880 --> 3:37:26.840]  He said, look, this is not anything, this is not an investigation, oh, let's just look
[3:37:26.840 --> 3:37:28.240]  and see if there's anything here.
[3:37:28.240 --> 3:37:30.000]  They've been looking for several months.
[3:37:30.000 --> 3:37:33.640]  They've been looking since, what is it, last, what wasn't July?
[3:37:33.640 --> 3:37:34.920]  July was when the DNC was.
[3:37:34.920 --> 3:37:39.200]  So it was before that, they've been looking into Russian interference into our election
[3:37:39.200 --> 3:37:40.480]  and all that amount of time.
[3:37:40.480 --> 3:37:42.480]  They haven't found anything yet.
[3:37:42.480 --> 3:37:47.480]  Believe me, if they found something they would have told you, instead, as Marco Rubio
[3:37:47.480 --> 3:37:53.360]  pointed out during the testimony of Comey, he said, why is it that all the senators here,
[3:37:53.360 --> 3:37:57.440]  all the staffers here, all the mainstream media knows, but you will not say it in public.
[3:37:57.440 --> 3:38:02.720]  The only thing that you won't leak out is that Trump is not under investigation by you.
[3:38:02.720 --> 3:38:05.360]  Well, at some point in the future, he might be under investigation.
[3:38:05.360 --> 3:38:07.760]  So we can't really do that because we'd have a duty to retract.
[3:38:07.760 --> 3:38:11.080]  It's like you would have no problem doing that.
[3:38:11.080 --> 3:38:13.680]  You had no problem doing that for Hillary Clinton.
[3:38:13.680 --> 3:38:18.040]  You had no problem coming back out with that after you shut down and removed the cloud
[3:38:18.040 --> 3:38:22.880]  for her at the request of Loretta Lynch.
[3:38:22.880 --> 3:38:25.960]  So this is the double standard that we have here, the criminal standard I'm going to get
[3:38:25.960 --> 3:38:26.960]  to in just a moment.
[3:38:26.960 --> 3:38:31.760]  Meanwhile, Louis Gohmert said that Mueller is dirty and should recuse himself.
[3:38:31.760 --> 3:38:37.200]  We have a congressman calling the special investigator, Robert Mueller, dirty.
[3:38:37.200 --> 3:38:39.200]  Why does he say that?
[3:38:39.200 --> 3:38:43.640]  He said the creation of special counsel was a ruse by dishonest Comey.
[3:38:43.640 --> 3:38:49.560]  He said there is so much collusion, real collusion in the Justice Department, including collusion
[3:38:49.560 --> 3:38:51.320]  between Comey and Mueller.
[3:38:51.320 --> 3:38:54.400]  He said there is no collusion with this administration in Russia.
[3:38:54.400 --> 3:38:57.440]  We can drop that independent counsel, that special counsel.
[3:38:57.440 --> 3:38:58.760]  There is no further need.
[3:38:58.760 --> 3:39:03.120]  And now that we have collusion between Comey and Mueller before he testified, also ran
[3:39:03.120 --> 3:39:08.800]  things by other people in the Justice Department when they did their memo, so much collusion.
[3:39:08.800 --> 3:39:09.880]  Here's what he said specifically.
[3:39:09.880 --> 3:39:13.200]  Now we know the collusion between Comey and Mueller.
[3:39:13.200 --> 3:39:17.520]  This is what Gohmert said in the interview on Fox News today.
[3:39:17.520 --> 3:39:21.920]  He said, Comey ran things by Mueller before he testified.
[3:39:21.920 --> 3:39:25.960]  You think maybe that was what was happening when Bill Clinton and Lynch met on the tarmac?
[3:39:25.960 --> 3:39:28.080]  Do you think they were running stuff through?
[3:39:28.080 --> 3:39:29.360]  What do you know?
[3:39:29.360 --> 3:39:33.440]  What could she be in jeopardy for in terms of perjury?
[3:39:33.440 --> 3:39:37.920]  Because as I pointed out before, Bill Clinton wasn't impeached for rape.
[3:39:37.920 --> 3:39:39.680]  He wasn't impeached for sexual assault.
[3:39:39.680 --> 3:39:45.560]  There were strong allegations that were never investigated by the special counsel who did
[3:39:45.560 --> 3:39:46.560]  that.
[3:39:46.560 --> 3:39:52.800]  And of course, that special counsel went on to be the defense counsel for Epstein and
[3:39:52.800 --> 3:39:58.440]  his pedophile and also become president of Baylor University and cover up for rape allegations
[3:39:58.440 --> 3:39:59.440]  of the football team there.
[3:39:59.440 --> 3:40:01.120]  So he didn't want to go under the rape allegations.
[3:40:01.120 --> 3:40:02.960]  He didn't want to go under the hard stuff.
[3:40:02.960 --> 3:40:08.280]  Instead, what he did was he came after a little wimpy charge of perjury.
[3:40:08.280 --> 3:40:11.920]  And of course, Bill Clinton as a lawyer, he knows the seriousness of perjury, but came
[3:40:11.920 --> 3:40:17.280]  after him for perjury about a consensual relationship, which is not a crime, not a crime.
[3:40:17.280 --> 3:40:21.360]  But he said, Comey ran things by Mueller before he testified.
[3:40:21.360 --> 3:40:25.040]  Make sure that he didn't get caught in something other than maybe he should have talked to
[3:40:25.040 --> 3:40:28.000]  him about the fact that he said, Hey, it'd be a big deal if somebody put political pressure
[3:40:28.000 --> 3:40:29.000]  on me.
[3:40:29.000 --> 3:40:30.720]  He did commit perjury.
[3:40:30.720 --> 3:40:35.240]  I don't understand why that isn't headline news that he committed perjury.
[3:40:35.240 --> 3:40:38.280]  He committed perjury because he said it would be a big deal if anybody ever put political
[3:40:38.280 --> 3:40:39.280]  pressure on me.
[3:40:39.280 --> 3:40:44.560]  Then he says under oath again, he put political pressure on me after saying no, nobody ever
[3:40:44.560 --> 3:40:46.120]  did that.
[3:40:46.120 --> 3:40:51.840]  That's a, we got two different testimonies under oath saying two different contradictory
[3:40:51.840 --> 3:40:52.840]  things.
[3:40:52.840 --> 3:40:56.120]  He either perjured himself one time or he perjured himself the other time.
[3:40:56.120 --> 3:41:00.480]  But he says, Comey also ran things by other people in the justice department when he did
[3:41:00.480 --> 3:41:01.480]  the memo.
[3:41:01.480 --> 3:41:04.920]  There is so much collusion, real collusion in the justice department.
[3:41:04.920 --> 3:41:06.440]  Let's talk about Comey.
[3:41:06.440 --> 3:41:13.320]  Let's talk about dirty Comey, you know, Comey, Stonewall and congressional requests for
[3:41:13.320 --> 3:41:17.440]  information about his involvement with the British spy, Christopher Steele, who created
[3:41:17.440 --> 3:41:18.440]  the dirty dossier.
[3:41:18.440 --> 3:41:22.800]  Remember in the testimony that we had last week, we had Comey saying, well, I called
[3:41:22.800 --> 3:41:27.960]  the first meeting and of course it's okay if Comey calls a private meeting with the
[3:41:27.960 --> 3:41:28.960]  president.
[3:41:28.960 --> 3:41:30.320]  There's nothing inappropriate about that.
[3:41:30.320 --> 3:41:34.880]  But if the president calls a private meeting with Comey, oh, that's flags go up, flags
[3:41:34.880 --> 3:41:35.880]  go up.
[3:41:35.880 --> 3:41:39.760]  That's right there, that's obstruction of justice if Donald Trump were to call a private
[3:41:39.760 --> 3:41:40.760]  meeting.
[3:41:40.760 --> 3:41:43.560]  But no, Comey can call a private meeting and Comey said, well, I wanted to call his private
[3:41:43.560 --> 3:41:47.080]  meeting because, you know, he had this dirty dossier that was floating around and I didn't
[3:41:47.080 --> 3:41:50.440]  want him to think that I was doing something like Jagger Hoover.
[3:41:50.440 --> 3:41:54.680]  Now, he was doing something exactly like Jagger Hoover.
[3:41:54.680 --> 3:41:59.280]  He knows Jagger Hoover's history and Trump knows Comey's history for the reasons he fired
[3:41:59.280 --> 3:42:00.280]  him.
[3:42:00.280 --> 3:42:05.640]  But he's Stonewall, this congressional investigation requests for information about his and the
[3:42:05.640 --> 3:42:11.720]  FBI's involvement with the British spy who produced that slanderous dirty dossier.
[3:42:11.720 --> 3:42:16.360]  That was an obstruction of justice, that was involvement in dirty tricks.
[3:42:16.360 --> 3:42:20.040]  And let me read this to you because I always get to this just before the break and I always
[3:42:20.040 --> 3:42:21.960]  have to cut this short.
[3:42:21.960 --> 3:42:28.480]  Back on March 6th, we had the Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley, Republican
[3:42:28.480 --> 3:42:36.360]  Senator from Iowa, sent a letter to FBI Director James Comey asking if the FBI had ever attempted
[3:42:36.360 --> 3:42:43.060]  to hire Christopher Steele, the British spy who created the false dirty dossier that Buzz
[3:42:43.060 --> 3:42:46.280]  Feed ran with and everybody mocked eventually.
[3:42:46.280 --> 3:42:49.240]  And he said this in that March 6th letter.
[3:42:49.240 --> 3:42:54.880]  He said the idea, this is Senator Grassley writing to Comey, the idea that the FBI and
[3:42:54.880 --> 3:42:58.920]  associates of the Clinton campaign would pay Mr. Steele to investigate the Republican
[3:42:58.920 --> 3:43:03.840]  nominee for president and the run up to the election raises substantial questions about
[3:43:03.840 --> 3:43:09.920]  the FBI's independence from politics, as well as the Obama administration's use of law enforcement
[3:43:09.920 --> 3:43:12.400]  and intelligence agencies for political ends.
[3:43:12.400 --> 3:43:18.600]  And let me underscore this as equally surprising to me that we don't have people talking about
[3:43:18.600 --> 3:43:21.480]  James Comey committing perjury.
[3:43:21.480 --> 3:43:26.240]  The big story here, folks, is the fact that we had the Obama administration use law enforcement
[3:43:26.240 --> 3:43:30.320]  and intelligence agencies for political purposes.
[3:43:30.320 --> 3:43:36.480]  This is the worst possible outcome we could have of this massive surveillance machinery
[3:43:36.480 --> 3:43:40.600]  that we have created in the wake of the 9-11 false flag.
[3:43:40.600 --> 3:43:43.560]  This is where this is all headed.
[3:43:43.560 --> 3:43:45.880]  This is the worst possible outcome.
[3:43:45.880 --> 3:43:49.120]  It's always going to be the people in power who are going to be the ones who are going
[3:43:49.120 --> 3:43:51.560]  to be up against the wall first.
[3:43:51.560 --> 3:43:55.920]  And of course, as we know now, they were investigating and spying on Americans without warrant and
[3:43:55.920 --> 3:44:01.880]  clear violation of the law, not even the Patriot Act or Section 702 gives them the authority
[3:44:01.880 --> 3:44:04.760]  to spy on Americans without a search warrant.
[3:44:04.760 --> 3:44:08.800]  The FBI and the Obama administration and the NSA violated the law.
[3:44:08.800 --> 3:44:14.520]  We've now had the FISA court, which is created to stop that and then became essentially a
[3:44:14.520 --> 3:44:18.120]  tool for them to do dragnet surveillance of Mr. and Mrs. Verizon.
[3:44:18.120 --> 3:44:24.560]  But even the FISA court is concerned about the political use of this surveillance state.
[3:44:24.560 --> 3:44:28.200]  They not only called this a violation of the Constitution, a violation of the law, but
[3:44:28.200 --> 3:44:34.720]  then they took essentially an unprecedented step and declassified their court decision
[3:44:34.720 --> 3:44:38.720]  for everybody to hear and nobody is listening.
[3:44:38.720 --> 3:44:40.040]  Nobody is paying any attention.
[3:44:40.040 --> 3:44:44.480]  This is not an anonymous source from the New York Times or the Washington Post saying that
[3:44:44.480 --> 3:44:51.280]  Obama and the intelligence agencies that worked for him used their power for political purposes.
[3:44:51.280 --> 3:44:57.080]  This is the FISA court saying that this is a violation of the law and nobody is listening.
[3:44:57.080 --> 3:45:03.120]  Just as FBI Director Comey refused to listen to Senator Grassley when he said, I want to
[3:45:03.120 --> 3:45:07.800]  know what your involvement is with the guy that created this dirty dossier.
[3:45:07.800 --> 3:45:10.080]  So he sent in that letter on March the 6th.
[3:45:10.080 --> 3:45:13.960]  He said, I want to hear from you in two weeks, March the 20th.
[3:45:13.960 --> 3:45:17.560]  So April the 28th, he writes in a letter and says, you know what, I never heard back from
[3:45:17.560 --> 3:45:18.560]  you.
[3:45:18.560 --> 3:45:21.000]  He used a little bit stronger language than that.
[3:45:21.000 --> 3:45:24.320]  He said on March 6th, I wrote to you requesting information about the FBI's relationship with
[3:45:24.320 --> 3:45:30.600]  Mr. Christopher Steele, author of the political opposition research dossier alleging collusion
[3:45:30.600 --> 3:45:32.560]  with Trump and the Russian government.
[3:45:32.560 --> 3:45:37.560]  Although that letter asked for a response by the 20th of March, the FBI has failed to
[3:45:37.560 --> 3:45:38.560]  provide one.
[3:45:38.560 --> 3:45:41.720]  So a month later, a month and 10 days later, he writes into that.
[3:45:41.720 --> 3:45:47.120]  He says, after a startling lack of response from the FBI, I was forced to delay committee
[3:45:47.120 --> 3:45:51.580]  proceedings on the nomination for Deputy Attorney General in order to get the Department
[3:45:51.580 --> 3:45:53.480]  of Justice's cooperation.
[3:45:53.480 --> 3:46:00.480]  Nevertheless, on April the 19th, the FBI sent Ranking Member Feinstein and me a four-sentence
[3:46:00.480 --> 3:46:05.800]  letter purporting to be a response to the February 15th and March 6th letters.
[3:46:05.800 --> 3:46:12.920]  Two of those sentences are merely standard closing boilerplate language in FBI letters.
[3:46:12.920 --> 3:46:19.920]  So in other words, he sends him a two-sentence response after a month after he had asked
[3:46:19.920 --> 3:46:20.920]  for a response.
[3:46:20.920 --> 3:46:25.360]  Giving him two weeks, he takes six weeks and he gives him a two-sentence response.
[3:46:25.360 --> 3:46:28.640]  He said the letter did not answer any of the questions, instead incorrectly claimed that
[3:46:28.640 --> 3:46:33.600]  the briefing addressed the concerns raised in both the February 15th and March 6th letters.
[3:46:33.600 --> 3:46:39.080]  There appear to be, says the Senator to Comey, material inconsistencies between the description
[3:46:39.080 --> 3:46:43.960]  of the FBI's relationship with Mr. Steele that you did provide in your briefing and
[3:46:43.960 --> 3:46:46.080]  information contained in Justice Department documents.
[3:46:46.080 --> 3:46:48.960]  In other words, you're lying.
[3:46:48.960 --> 3:46:50.720]  You're lying, Comey.
[3:46:50.720 --> 3:46:52.840]  You sent me a response.
[3:46:52.840 --> 3:46:54.960]  You've said things that contradict.
[3:46:54.960 --> 3:46:59.920]  How long is James Comey going to be given a pass for lying?
[3:46:59.920 --> 3:47:04.400]  Well, I guess as long as Hillary Clinton is going to be given a pass for felony violations
[3:47:04.400 --> 3:47:08.560]  of handling classified documents, we'll have a pass from James Comey.
[3:47:08.560 --> 3:47:13.360]  These people operate on a privileged basis.
[3:47:13.360 --> 3:47:17.480]  Other people do things and go to jail, but not these people.
[3:47:17.480 --> 3:47:19.080]  So let's take a look at this.
[3:47:19.080 --> 3:47:24.800]  What he said, four things that he said, Senator Grassley to FBI Director Comey.
[3:47:24.800 --> 3:47:28.480]  He said, in addition to fully answering my March 6th letter, please give me the following
[3:47:28.480 --> 3:47:31.240]  documents and information, these four things.
[3:47:31.240 --> 3:47:36.960]  Please give me documentations of all payments made to Mr. Steele, the British spy who comes
[3:47:36.960 --> 3:47:45.960]  up with this lying document that they then leaked through this swamp rag buzzfeed.
[3:47:45.960 --> 3:47:49.720]  Please document all payments you made him, including travel expenses, if any, and the
[3:47:49.720 --> 3:47:54.960]  date of such payments, the amount of such payments, the authorization for such payments.
[3:47:54.960 --> 3:48:00.120]  Number two, when the FBI was in contact with Mr. Steele or otherwise relying on information
[3:48:00.120 --> 3:48:05.260]  in the dossier, was it aware that his employer, Fusion GPS, was allegedly simultaneously working
[3:48:05.260 --> 3:48:08.320]  as an unregistered agent for Russian interests?
[3:48:08.320 --> 3:48:10.240]  Please provide all related documents.
[3:48:10.240 --> 3:48:15.080]  Number three, if so, if you did know that he was his employer, was working as an unregistered
[3:48:15.080 --> 3:48:21.320]  agent for the Russians, when and how did the FBI become aware that the guy who wrote this
[3:48:21.320 --> 3:48:26.200]  dirty dossier was working for an unregistered agent for Russian interests?
[3:48:26.200 --> 3:48:29.800]  Did it include the information about Fusion GPS's alleged work for Russian principles
[3:48:29.800 --> 3:48:33.600]  in any of the documents describing or relying on information from the dossier?
[3:48:33.600 --> 3:48:35.000]  If not, why not?
[3:48:35.000 --> 3:48:41.560]  And lastly, if the FBI was previously unaware but has now learned of this, does the FBI
[3:48:41.560 --> 3:48:45.640]  plan to amend any application reports or other documents it's created to describe or rely
[3:48:45.640 --> 3:48:49.040]  on the information in the dossier to add to this information, so forth?
[3:48:49.040 --> 3:48:54.160]  So it's very, very legalistic in terms of its case, but he's saying this, look, we know
[3:48:54.160 --> 3:48:55.160]  what you were doing.
[3:48:55.160 --> 3:48:56.160]  So why don't you come clean?
[3:48:56.160 --> 3:48:57.160]  Why don't you give us an answer?
[3:48:57.160 --> 3:48:59.280]  And of course, Comey would not.
[3:48:59.280 --> 3:49:00.280]  Comey would not.
[3:49:00.280 --> 3:49:05.840]  He is openly and defiantly in the face of the American people, pushed a double standard.
[3:49:05.840 --> 3:49:10.400]  He said there's one standard for Hillary Clinton and another standard for everybody else.
[3:49:10.400 --> 3:49:14.080]  She can violate the highest classified information.
[3:49:14.080 --> 3:49:19.240]  She can create her own private server for her own purposes to cover up her information.
[3:49:19.240 --> 3:49:21.560]  And yet, if you do this, we're gonna come after you.
[3:49:21.560 --> 3:49:22.560]  And he did.
[3:49:22.560 --> 3:49:26.240]  He came after a guy who worked on a submarine who took a couple of snapshots of his workplace
[3:49:26.240 --> 3:49:27.240]  as a souvenir.
[3:49:27.240 --> 3:49:29.360]  He didn't have any criminal intent.
[3:49:29.360 --> 3:49:32.880]  That was supposed to be what let Hillary Clinton go, but of course there's nothing in the statute
[3:49:32.880 --> 3:49:33.880]  about that.
[3:49:33.880 --> 3:49:37.760]  He simply has a different standard for her, just like he had a different standard for
[3:49:37.760 --> 3:49:43.320]  Sandy Berger, who stole classified documents out of the National Security Archives, who
[3:49:43.320 --> 3:49:49.320]  destroyed classified documents, who obstructed justice on the behalf of the Clintons, and
[3:49:49.320 --> 3:49:52.600]  it was James Comey who gave Sandy Berger a pass.
[3:49:52.600 --> 3:49:57.760]  Then he openly committed perjury and sworn testimony before these people.
[3:49:57.760 --> 3:50:00.560]  And then he kept classified information on his personal computer.
[3:50:00.560 --> 3:50:05.760]  If in fact he did memorialize his conversation as he claims now, he kept that information
[3:50:05.760 --> 3:50:11.440]  on his own personal computer, the exact same thing that he had just had an FBI investigation
[3:50:11.440 --> 3:50:14.880]  on Hillary Clinton saying, you know, you can't put this on something.
[3:50:14.880 --> 3:50:19.200]  Call at clintonemails.com, the big red flag out there for everybody to come get the information.
[3:50:19.200 --> 3:50:23.720]  Of course, maybe that's the back channel where she could provide stuff to people that had
[3:50:23.720 --> 3:50:25.120]  given her money.
[3:50:25.120 --> 3:50:26.120]  I don't know.
[3:50:26.120 --> 3:50:27.440]  That's something that should be looked at.
[3:50:27.440 --> 3:50:33.520]  But this guy violates security protocols for his own personal Machiavellian agenda, just
[3:50:33.520 --> 3:50:34.520]  like Hillary Clinton.
[3:50:34.520 --> 3:50:36.840]  And of course, he gets a pass.
[3:50:36.840 --> 3:50:40.880]  And there's no investigation in the Department of Homeland Security hacking into the boards
[3:50:40.880 --> 3:50:45.760]  of elections of Georgia and Indiana, trying to make a case that that's critical infrastructure
[3:50:45.760 --> 3:50:48.280]  and they need to have a backdoor into it.
[3:50:48.280 --> 3:50:53.480]  And then I think this whole thing with reality winner is another false flag to justify that,
[3:50:53.480 --> 3:50:57.360]  to put that under the control of Homeland Security because there's not going to be any
[3:50:57.360 --> 3:50:58.680]  FBI investigation of that.
[3:50:58.680 --> 3:50:59.680]  Stay with us.
[3:50:59.680 --> 3:51:00.680]  We'll be right back.
[3:51:00.680 --> 3:51:04.840]  The fight really works, just listen to what some people have to say.
[3:51:04.840 --> 3:51:07.680]  About six months ago, my wife bought extended light.
[3:51:07.680 --> 3:51:10.200]  She didn't tell me she was doing it to me.
[3:51:10.200 --> 3:51:15.520]  So after about three days, maybe the weather's changed or something, I said, my legs feel
[3:51:15.520 --> 3:51:16.520]  really good.
[3:51:16.520 --> 3:51:20.280]  And she goes, well, I've been giving you this stuff and it was extended light.
[3:51:20.280 --> 3:51:23.640]  And you know that I'm about 75% better.
[3:51:23.640 --> 3:51:27.680]  I can actually climb stairs now and I can get up out of chairs.
[3:51:27.680 --> 3:51:31.800]  I can, I can even get down and, you know, I got to work under a table or a computer
[3:51:31.800 --> 3:51:35.440]  table and work on a computer and I can actually get back up off the floor.
[3:51:35.440 --> 3:51:36.440]  You know what?
[3:51:36.440 --> 3:51:37.440]  It's an amazing product.
[3:51:37.440 --> 3:51:41.840]  I can't believe I didn't think anything short of having surgery was going to help.
[3:51:41.840 --> 3:51:46.640]  Extendivite is only $69.95 for a two month supply of either capsules or liquid.

[3:51:59.200 --> 3:52:03.600]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[3:52:03.600 --> 3:52:08.280]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[3:52:08.280 --> 3:52:09.800]  to detoxify the body.
[3:52:09.800 --> 3:52:14.640]  That's why I'm introducing Z Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[3:52:14.640 --> 3:52:16.160]  It's made in the USA.
[3:52:16.160 --> 3:52:21.080]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[3:52:21.080 --> 3:52:22.920]  the body and it supports the info war.
[3:52:22.920 --> 3:52:25.160]  It is a classical 360 win.
[3:52:25.160 --> 3:52:29.640]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe
[3:52:29.640 --> 3:52:34.440]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[3:52:34.440 --> 3:52:35.440]  get.
[3:52:35.440 --> 3:52:38.480]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this
[3:52:38.480 --> 3:52:43.480]  country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[3:52:43.480 --> 3:52:48.640]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[3:52:48.640 --> 3:52:52.440]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be thanks to your support and your
[3:52:52.440 --> 3:52:53.440]  prayers together.
[3:52:53.440 --> 3:52:54.440]  We're changing the world.
[3:52:54.440 --> 3:52:58.800]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z Shield and inforwarslife.com.
[3:52:58.800 --> 3:53:03.480]  The Genesis Communications Network is one of America's premier broadcasters of captivating
[3:53:03.480 --> 3:53:04.760]  talk radio.
[3:53:04.760 --> 3:53:06.080]  We thank you for listening.

[3:53:10.600 --> 3:53:11.600]  as you are.
[3:53:11.600 --> 3:53:16.120]  But what you may not realize is how easy and affordable it is to advertise with us.
[3:53:16.120 --> 3:53:19.640]  Radio commercials for your business could be heard on hundreds of radio stations across
[3:53:19.640 --> 3:53:21.480]  the U.S. every day.
[3:53:21.480 --> 3:53:26.600]  We can help you by creating an effective radio advertising campaign for your company, from

[3:54:11.280 --> 3:54:12.280]  It's Jones Show.
[3:54:12.280 --> 3:54:13.280]  I'm David Knight.
[3:54:13.280 --> 3:54:16.720]  Before we get back to the news, I'm going to talk about J.P. Morgan pulling their ads
[3:54:16.720 --> 3:54:24.920]  from NBC News because Megan Kelly is interviewing Alex Jones, so J.P. Megan, I guess, to them
[3:54:24.920 --> 3:54:26.480]  working together.
[3:54:26.480 --> 3:54:30.640]  But we'll talk about what's really behind that, what's behind really J.P. Morgan.
[3:54:30.640 --> 3:54:31.640]  Just a second.
[3:54:31.640 --> 3:54:36.480]  Before we do, understand that the way we fund our operation here is not with J.P. Morgan.
[3:54:36.480 --> 3:54:37.480]  They do not support our operation.
[3:54:37.480 --> 3:54:41.160]  As a matter of fact, they have gone to great links to shut down information that we give
[3:54:41.160 --> 3:54:47.840]  you about the phony Federal Reserve system and the crimes of large banks like J.P. Morgan.
[3:54:47.840 --> 3:54:51.720]  They pay a lot of money to a whistleblower to shut her up to make sure these crimes are
[3:54:51.720 --> 3:54:54.120]  not given a public hearing.
[3:54:54.120 --> 3:54:57.080]  But we promote our operation here.
[3:54:57.080 --> 3:54:59.320]  We fund our operation with the products that we sell.
[3:54:59.320 --> 3:55:03.320]  We go out and we try to find things that we know are good for you, things like selenium.
[3:55:03.320 --> 3:55:08.600]  There's no question that selenium supports thyroid gland and immune system help.
[3:55:08.600 --> 3:55:11.760]  It supports DNA production and eyesight.
[3:55:11.760 --> 3:55:14.720]  The question is, where do you get a good source of selenium?
[3:55:14.720 --> 3:55:19.720]  We wanted to give you a 100% organic source from mustard seed of selenium.
[3:55:19.720 --> 3:55:21.040]  We now have that back in stock.
[3:55:21.040 --> 3:55:23.080]  You can get it 25% off.
[3:55:23.080 --> 3:55:28.200]  That's why we call it bio-true selenium because it's 100% organic and it's not synthetic
[3:55:28.200 --> 3:55:29.200]  selenium.
[3:55:29.200 --> 3:55:32.320]  That's 25% off at infowarslife.com.
[3:55:32.320 --> 3:55:37.840]  Also super blue fluoride-free toothpaste is now back in stock, 33% off retail.
[3:55:37.840 --> 3:55:43.160]  Again, we look at toothpaste and we say a lot of people go out of their way to put fluoride
[3:55:43.160 --> 3:55:44.560]  into the toothpaste.
[3:55:44.560 --> 3:55:45.880]  We take it out.
[3:55:45.880 --> 3:55:47.280]  We feel that it is harmful.
[3:55:47.280 --> 3:55:53.280]  So instead, what we did was we put in nanosilver and iodine to help fight bacteria in your
[3:55:53.280 --> 3:55:54.280]  mouth.
[3:55:54.280 --> 3:55:55.280]  That's going to help your breath.
[3:55:55.280 --> 3:55:57.200]  It's going to help your health if you have healthy gums.
[3:55:57.200 --> 3:56:03.040]  It's going to fight heart disease that can come from unhealthy gums as well as things
[3:56:03.040 --> 3:56:04.640]  like peppermint oil.
[3:56:04.640 --> 3:56:09.840]  So you can get that now at 33% off, that's our nanosilver super blue fluoride-free toothpaste
[3:56:09.840 --> 3:56:11.680]  that fights infections.
[3:56:11.680 --> 3:56:16.160]  And also our new line of Emmerich's Essentials is at infowarsstore.com.
[3:56:16.160 --> 3:56:19.520]  We came up with a bug spray that doesn't have something that's very dangerous and harmful
[3:56:19.520 --> 3:56:20.520]  like deet.
[3:56:20.520 --> 3:56:22.240]  We came up with tea tree shampoo.
[3:56:22.240 --> 3:56:25.040]  We came up with deodorant that does not have aluminum in it.
[3:56:25.040 --> 3:56:28.080]  So you can find those natural organic household products.
[3:56:28.080 --> 3:56:31.200]  Again, that new line Emmerich's Essentials you'll find at infowarsstore.com.
[3:56:31.200 --> 3:56:34.600]  Let's talk quickly about JPMorgan.
[3:56:34.600 --> 3:56:40.200]  Remember JPMorgan, the namesake of the bank that exists today, was a guy who manufactured
[3:56:40.200 --> 3:56:45.040]  a banking crisis, created chaos, and then offered the Federal Reserve a central bank
[3:56:45.040 --> 3:56:49.280]  as a solution to that, the beast from Jekyll Island.
[3:56:49.280 --> 3:56:55.040]  And so it's interesting to me because I did a report on that, the 100th anniversary of
[3:56:55.040 --> 3:56:56.840]  the creation of that fraud.
[3:56:56.840 --> 3:57:03.200]  And now we've even got a guy who is a Turkish citizen, the CEO of Cibani Yogurt, sitting
[3:57:03.200 --> 3:57:06.680]  on the Federal Reserve, determining what our monetary policy is.
[3:57:06.680 --> 3:57:08.040]  This is a rigged system.
[3:57:08.040 --> 3:57:09.720]  It is a private organization.
[3:57:09.720 --> 3:57:12.600]  They pretend that they are federal and they're not federal.
[3:57:12.600 --> 3:57:15.640]  The no more federal than federal express is everyone likes to say.
[3:57:15.640 --> 3:57:20.880]  But I did a short piece on the 100th anniversary of it because they did it at Christmas time.
[3:57:20.880 --> 3:57:23.400]  They did it while people were not there.
[3:57:23.400 --> 3:57:27.200]  They didn't have as many people on the floor so they could get this thing through with
[3:57:27.200 --> 3:57:28.600]  no press coverage.
[3:57:28.600 --> 3:57:31.040]  I called it, it's a wonderful lie.
[3:57:31.040 --> 3:57:35.760]  When I interspersed comments about the creation of the Federal Reserve with the movie, it's
[3:57:35.760 --> 3:57:38.840]  a wonderful life because it's all happened at Christmas time.
[3:57:38.840 --> 3:57:40.320]  That was taken down multiple times.
[3:57:40.320 --> 3:57:44.760]  Every time it would get up to 12,000 views, they would take it down, say copyright violation.
[3:57:44.760 --> 3:57:46.280]  It wasn't a copyright violation.
[3:57:46.280 --> 3:57:51.040]  I would play a little bit of the clip and then I would comment on it and I would talk
[3:57:51.040 --> 3:57:53.440]  about the different connections between it.
[3:57:53.440 --> 3:57:55.480]  There you can see part of it, how I did it.
[3:57:55.480 --> 3:57:56.600]  So it was going back and forth.
[3:57:56.600 --> 3:57:57.920]  It was a fair use commentary.
[3:57:57.920 --> 3:58:03.640]  I was showing how this banker, as you can see right there, creates a financial crisis
[3:58:03.640 --> 3:58:08.280]  so he can drive his competitors out of business and corner the market in real estate.
[3:58:08.280 --> 3:58:11.400]  And so they kept shutting it down and so we told other people, you put it up.
[3:58:11.400 --> 3:58:15.000]  As though we'd get to 12,000 views, they would shut that down as well.
[3:58:15.000 --> 3:58:18.400]  So we're out of time right now, but tonight I'm going to talk about JP Morgan.
[3:58:18.400 --> 3:58:20.360]  I'm going to talk about the company that's there.
[3:58:20.360 --> 3:58:26.000]  I'm going to talk about how they wanted to silence this woman who talked about the banking
[3:58:26.000 --> 3:58:28.600]  crisis, the mortgage fraud that they did.
[3:58:28.600 --> 3:58:34.400]  They were willing to pay $9 billion in fees just so that there would not be a public hearing,
[3:58:34.400 --> 3:58:37.960]  just as the Democrats want to make sure that we got Jeff Sessions and a public hearing
[3:58:37.960 --> 3:58:38.960]  now.
[3:58:38.960 --> 3:58:58.360]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
