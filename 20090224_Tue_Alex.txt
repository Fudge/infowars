[00:00.000 --> 00:11.560]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.560 --> 00:19.140]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.140 --> 00:30.480]  Texas Alex Jones welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome and thank you for
[00:30.480 --> 00:33.980]  joining us for this worldwide transmission it is Tuesday the 24th
[00:33.980 --> 00:41.380]  day of February 2009 we're gonna be live here for the next four hours we've got
[00:41.380 --> 00:45.460]  Dr. Edwin Vieira scheduled for later in the transmission today to get his take
[00:45.460 --> 00:51.740]  on not just the states moving now close to 30 of the moving towards sovereignty
[00:51.740 --> 00:59.980]  and some states are now passing those resolutions like Oklahoma we don't just
[00:59.980 --> 01:03.180]  have him coming on about that we're gonna be discussing how sheriffs and
[01:03.180 --> 01:07.140]  counties and quote committees of safety that's what the Sons of Liberty first
[01:07.140 --> 01:10.660]  set up in the decade before the Revolutionary War are being set up
[01:10.660 --> 01:17.300]  across the United States as well as a counter to the globalist other than that
[01:17.300 --> 01:20.740]  I've got a lot of important news I want to go over today very important
[01:20.740 --> 01:25.300]  information as things just accelerate and develop faster and faster inside this
[01:25.300 --> 01:29.300]  new order system and as the people awaken in the establishment attempts to
[01:29.300 --> 01:36.460]  block that awakening and suppress the people I do want to take a lot of phone
[01:36.460 --> 01:42.380]  calls in this first hour second hour third hour fourth hour today but you know
[01:42.380 --> 01:45.940]  I've said this probably a thousand times and I'll say it again and overall I've
[01:45.940 --> 01:49.500]  gotten better about going to the calls when I give the number out but I tend
[01:49.500 --> 01:53.580]  to get stuck on each call going over all their questions and comments and then
[01:53.580 --> 01:57.580]  trying to break it down in some detail but in the interest of people being able
[01:57.580 --> 02:04.100]  to get on the show who can never get through I'll just say that anybody who
[02:04.100 --> 02:09.860]  can call who wants to but I would like to give first-time callers and folks
[02:09.860 --> 02:13.520]  who haven't been able to get through a chance on the air a chance to hear from
[02:13.520 --> 02:18.540]  military a chance to hear from police about all the urban warfare gun
[02:18.540 --> 02:23.340]  confiscation drills going on across the country a chance for the population to
[02:23.340 --> 02:28.140]  talk about the fact that 9.7 trillion has been stolen by the offshore banks out
[02:28.140 --> 02:31.420]  of the United States just from the United States alone they're also looting
[02:31.420 --> 02:36.100]  other nations the name of bailouts to fix the economy it's a type of financial
[02:36.100 --> 02:39.580]  terrorism where they stage the crisis and say do whatever we say give us
[02:39.580 --> 02:43.900]  unlimited power and funds or the world will end and then as people capitulate
[02:43.900 --> 02:50.220]  things only get worse because we're being routed through financial military
[02:50.220 --> 02:55.700]  attack financial warfare as the Japanese say all businesses war well it
[02:55.700 --> 03:00.100]  certainly is with the international bankers the toll-free number to join us
[03:00.100 --> 03:12.300]  on air today is 1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 and we will get you up
[03:12.300 --> 03:21.580]  and on the air today here are some of the important news stories I have in
[03:21.580 --> 03:24.900]  front of me bill seeks to withhold highway funds the states who don't
[03:24.900 --> 03:30.820]  comply with real ID yeah Bush signed an executive order last year saying that if
[03:30.820 --> 03:34.460]  states didn't let foreign companies take over their infrastructure and put
[03:34.460 --> 03:37.980]  toll roads on them they wouldn't get their money they take our state money
[03:37.980 --> 03:42.500]  and then the state signed over their sovereignty not just to the criminal
[03:42.500 --> 03:46.660]  federal government but to the offshore corporations and banks that are looting
[03:46.660 --> 03:51.500]  us and this dovetails with a CBS news report that you would think was a big
[03:51.500 --> 03:57.020]  expose about thousands of offshore tax havens and how a lot of the bailout
[03:57.020 --> 04:02.660]  money is going to that but really they're just setting a precedent to set up a
[04:02.660 --> 04:06.740]  world regulatory body over all of this and then they will selectively enforce
[04:06.740 --> 04:10.820]  it themselves it's the very banks and brokerage firms that run the new world
[04:10.820 --> 04:16.060]  order that don't pay taxes don't pay corporate taxes and don't pay private
[04:16.060 --> 04:23.300]  taxes remember over 65% of the Congress on record doesn't pay taxes this is a
[04:23.300 --> 04:29.260]  pack of criminals so we'll go over bill seeks to withhold highway funds the
[04:29.260 --> 04:31.980]  states who don't comply with real ID
[04:31.980 --> 04:37.860]  rebert martock warns nations will be redefined futures altered there's a new

[08:03.900 --> 08:29.940]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network every day the mainstream media is forced
[08:29.940 --> 08:37.420]  to admit that the climate change global warming crowd are a pack of liars but
[08:37.420 --> 08:42.300]  they always say oh it's a mistake they accidentally at weather monitoring sites
[08:42.300 --> 08:46.380]  across the planet claim that carbon dioxide levels were raising faster than
[08:46.380 --> 08:50.340]  they were oh they accidentally claimed that the earth was getting hotter in
[08:50.340 --> 08:54.540]  2008 when actually had record cold temperatures in the last hundred years
[08:54.540 --> 08:58.860]  oh they accidentally did this they accidentally did that like Al Gore in
[08:58.860 --> 09:03.180]  his film the inconvenient fraud I mean the inconvenient lie shows that carbon
[09:03.180 --> 09:09.660]  dioxide levels rise and that then heat rises when in all of the government
[09:09.660 --> 09:15.700]  university studies the heat level rises from the sun predominantly and then
[09:15.700 --> 09:21.220]  there's more life forms on the planet in warm weather and so more carbon dioxide
[09:21.220 --> 09:27.940]  is exhaled by by humans and animals and insects and plankton and then carbon
[09:27.940 --> 09:33.620]  dioxide levels go up and then that accelerates the life cycle the earth
[09:33.620 --> 09:39.420]  blooms in hot cycles just like the earth itself has seasons depending on its
[09:39.420 --> 09:45.820]  axis and its rotation and where it is in its orbit around the sun and so this is
[09:45.820 --> 09:49.540]  a spring and summer time when it's warming it is a fall and winter time
[09:49.540 --> 09:53.500]  when it's cooling and that's just a fact in the establishment knows that
[09:53.500 --> 09:56.180]  there's another story in the New York Times today that I want to go through
[09:56.180 --> 10:04.180]  later where it says Gore pulls slide of disaster trends and he's tying in
[10:04.180 --> 10:09.740]  tsunamis and wildfires and earthquakes I've seen do this before showing that
[10:09.740 --> 10:17.500]  disasters went up in the last 10 years which has nothing to do even if you
[10:17.500 --> 10:23.820]  believe that global warming is real or man-made it has nothing to do with it
[10:23.820 --> 10:27.940]  and by the way I have some mainstream news articles here where the governments
[10:27.940 --> 10:33.900]  of Europe and England are proposing not just taxes on cows and sheep and goats
[10:33.900 --> 10:39.460]  and fish and all meat not just taxes on your trash taxes on light bulbs toilets
[10:39.460 --> 10:44.940]  taxes on fireplaces or banning space heaters saying they are you know hurt
[10:44.940 --> 10:51.620]  the climate they want to tax countries when they have forest fires because so
[10:51.620 --> 10:59.140]  much carbon dioxide is put off when there are forest fires natural forest
[10:59.140 --> 11:04.260]  fires and there are also environmental groups in mainstream news proposing
[11:04.260 --> 11:10.340]  cutting down trees no I'm not kidding you can't make this up cutting down
[11:10.340 --> 11:20.620]  trees because trees also put off carbon dioxide I mean this is such a joke but
[11:20.620 --> 11:23.780]  they mean it to me ridiculous and over the top because if they can set the
[11:23.780 --> 11:26.820]  precedent for this they can set the present for anything but Gore pulls
[11:26.820 --> 11:34.180]  slide of disaster trends former president Al Gore vice president is
[11:34.180 --> 11:37.740]  pulling a dramatic slide from this ever-evolving global warming presentation
[11:37.740 --> 11:41.260]  when mr. Gore addressed the packed cheering hall at the annual meeting of
[11:41.260 --> 11:44.820]  American Association for Advancement of Science in Chicago earlier this month
[11:44.820 --> 11:49.100]  his climate slide show contained a startling graph showing a ceiling high
[11:49.100 --> 11:52.740]  spike of disasters in recent years the data came from the Center for Research
[11:52.740 --> 11:58.260]  on the epidemiology of disasters but the Catholic University of Lothian in
[11:58.260 --> 12:04.780]  Brussels the graph which was added to his talk last year just came after a
[12:04.780 --> 12:08.620]  sequence of images of people from Iowa to South Australia struggling with
[12:08.620 --> 12:12.700]  drought wildfires and flooding and other weather related calamities mr. Gore
[12:12.700 --> 12:17.580]  described the pattern as a manifestation of human-driven climate change and he
[12:17.580 --> 12:22.540]  went on but now they go on to say that now mr. Gore is dropping the graph his
[12:22.540 --> 12:26.500]  office of the day here's why two days after the talk mr. Gore was sharply
[12:26.500 --> 12:31.020]  criticized for using the data to make a point about global warming by Roger a
[12:31.020 --> 12:37.140]  Pylkirk junior I want to get him on the show a political scientist focused on
[12:37.140 --> 12:43.460]  disaster trends and climate policy the University of Colorado mr. Pichle Pichle
[12:43.460 --> 12:48.300]  noted that the Center for Research on epidemiology of disasters stress and
[12:48.300 --> 12:53.060]  reports that a host of factors unrelated to climate cause the enormous rise in
[12:53.060 --> 12:58.340]  reported disasters yeah like earthquakes and tsunamis and the tsunami was
[12:58.340 --> 13:03.740]  caused by an underwater huge tectonic plate shift nothing to do with your
[13:03.740 --> 13:08.700]  SUVs I assure you that huge tectonic plate shift a few years ago that killed
[13:08.700 --> 13:15.060]  hundreds of thousands with tidal waves tsunamis crashing across multiple
[13:15.060 --> 13:24.420]  countries island nations had as much to do with SUVs and coal-powered plants as
[13:24.420 --> 13:31.580]  much to do with that as coal-powered plants have a connection to the polar
[13:31.580 --> 13:37.900]  ice caps of Mars receding or expanding it's just unbelievable this is the crowd
[13:37.900 --> 13:41.740]  though that says that polar bears can't swim and are drowning you know because
[13:41.740 --> 13:46.660]  the the ice is melting and they point a video camera at a glacier that every
[13:46.660 --> 13:51.460]  spring and summer collapses large portions of it and creates ice flows
[13:51.460 --> 13:57.540]  because throughout the winter months rain and snow fall on the glaciers piling
[13:57.540 --> 14:03.060]  up and then it literally flows out in some cases miles a year towards the sea
[14:03.060 --> 14:07.260]  I mean that's how glaciers work but they know the public is dumbed down and
[14:07.260 --> 14:11.820]  completely focused on issues of little or no significance so they really believe
[14:11.820 --> 14:15.020]  that the polar bears can't swim and that glaciers aren't supposed to be
[14:15.020 --> 14:21.060]  expanding and contracting and going into the sea there have always been icebergs
[14:21.060 --> 14:26.700]  ladies and gentlemen that's what happens when the Arctic in the Antarctic warm
[14:26.700 --> 14:31.380]  during the summer large pieces break off and then it gets smaller in the summer
[14:31.380 --> 14:35.940]  and larger in the winter but you can't tell the public that they just want to
[14:35.940 --> 14:39.780]  be suckered and scammed and ripped off they love it
[14:39.780 --> 14:46.220]  meanwhile yesterday I saw a report that NASA was going to launch a rocket that
[14:46.220 --> 14:51.420]  was going to study co2 levels and what was actually putting co2 out and of
[14:51.420 --> 14:55.020]  course it was going to show that the ocean is the main driver of that waters
[14:55.020 --> 15:00.900]  made up mainly of carbon dioxide and they were going to show you know that
[15:00.900 --> 15:05.780]  carbon dioxide was coming out of you know humans and it was coming in and it
[15:05.780 --> 15:10.220]  was part of the life cycle and I remember saying to my wife I bet that
[15:10.220 --> 15:15.140]  satellite malfunctions or blows up well it it did blow up didn't didn't work too
[15:15.140 --> 15:20.220]  well so I didn't want that going up I mean how many NASA rockets fail it's a
[15:20.220 --> 15:25.860]  very low number but this one of course failed I'm sure it's just a coincidence
[15:25.860 --> 15:30.780]  a satellite launch from California failed to reach orbit today crashing into
[15:30.780 --> 15:36.580]  the sea near Antarctica and dooming a $273 million mission to study global
[15:36.580 --> 15:39.980]  warming gases the mission is lost the National Aeronautics and Space
[15:39.980 --> 15:43.980]  Administration spokesman Steve Cole said the telephone interview from the
[15:43.980 --> 15:49.460]  launch site at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California the NASA satellite was
[15:49.460 --> 15:54.300]  to orbit 438 miles above the earth and observe how carbon dioxide enters and
[15:54.300 --> 15:58.660]  leaves the atmosphere helping scientists predict future increases in the main
[15:58.660 --> 16:03.580]  greenhouse gas blamed notice these legalese there they don't say proven
[16:03.580 --> 16:07.780]  for global warming instead the satellite fell into the ocean near Antarctica
[16:07.780 --> 16:15.100]  through the mission manager said at no point did the craft pass over land you
[16:15.100 --> 16:19.100]  know speaking of spacecraft falling back into the earth two Sundays ago a
[16:19.100 --> 16:26.380]  gigantic piece of a satellite came in over Austin seeing in was videotaping a
[16:26.380 --> 16:31.540]  well was live out of their affiliate news eight Austin at the marathon
[16:31.540 --> 16:37.020]  downtown and I was on the radio at the time but I watched the video feed later
[16:37.020 --> 16:41.380]  and it looked like something out of a science fiction movie a giant fireball
[16:41.380 --> 16:46.820]  burning red and orange and blue comes in it's huge you know normally you see a
[16:46.820 --> 16:49.940]  video of a meteor or something it's just a tiny streak I mean it looked like
[16:49.940 --> 16:54.420]  something out of a movie just this huge fireball comes in and then starts
[16:54.420 --> 17:00.580]  exploding at about 20,000 feet explodes again at about 10,000 and then disappears
[17:00.580 --> 17:03.540]  into West Austin and last time I heard they never found the debris though some
[17:03.540 --> 17:10.900]  have said a bunch of trees got blown down what did local news do like Bob Cole
[17:10.900 --> 17:16.980]  and Bucky Godbolt show on on the popular morning shows they made jokes about me
[17:16.980 --> 17:21.460]  being a conspiracy theorist and that aliens were landing or something I mean
[17:21.460 --> 17:25.780]  that's how it works I mean a satellite comes in blows up over Austin looks like
[17:25.780 --> 17:31.540]  war of the worlds or something and then there's jokes about me when I don't
[17:31.540 --> 17:35.220]  cover space aliens and Chewbacca brothers like Larry King does and the rest of them
[17:35.220 --> 17:40.020]  you know I'm the guy pointing out that these aren't cigar shaped UFOs these are
[17:40.020 --> 17:45.140]  giant government blimps with four fins on them and surveillance and hanging off
[17:45.140 --> 17:49.020]  the bottom and on the sides of the craft they keep showing on the news every
[17:49.020 --> 17:57.300]  week saying aliens are invading blisters of solar panels I mean it's the homeland
[17:57.300 --> 18:01.700]  security blimps they admittedly launched in 2002 2003 but the government won't
[18:01.700 --> 18:05.060]  admit what they are so the media says they must be aliens meanwhile I get the
[18:05.060 --> 18:10.820]  blame for that when I'm the one exposing real conspiracy theories now another
[18:10.820 --> 18:13.460]  example that I mentioned earlier I'm not gonna spend much time on this I'm gonna
[18:13.460 --> 18:17.020]  try to get this guy on the show I'm not gonna be mean to the hoaxer because we
[18:17.020 --> 18:24.540]  learned he's actually contacted us and admits it that it was a hoax but KRMG
[18:24.540 --> 18:34.380]  morning news blog out of Tulsa Oklahoma comes out and says that basically I
[18:34.380 --> 18:41.020]  launched a hoax and that I gave the hoax national attention and implies I
[18:41.020 --> 18:46.140]  promoted it as real when I'm the one that exposed that it was a hoax
[18:46.140 --> 18:52.940]  by going and buying a digital TV converter the Magnavox same brand that
[18:52.940 --> 18:57.220]  went viral on YouTube last week and we opened it up and showed that it did not
[18:57.220 --> 19:02.580]  have a camera and microphone and we proved that it wasn't just that this
[19:02.580 --> 19:05.660]  individual you know had a different one than his had a camera because it's the
[19:05.660 --> 19:09.300]  exact same circuitry from his video that's inside the one we bought and
[19:09.300 --> 19:14.380]  there's no circuitry in there for the camera or the microphone and so I get
[19:14.380 --> 19:18.900]  blamed for it I'm the one that did the hoax I'm the one who put out the
[19:18.900 --> 19:24.460]  disinformation I'm the one who who who did this when I'm the one that exposed
[19:24.460 --> 19:32.500]  it and then when a real piece of space junk blows up over Austin in
[19:32.500 --> 19:40.020]  spectacular fashion and rains down on West Austin it's my fault I mean this
[19:40.020 --> 19:43.100]  is the type of baloney and then they've they've written several big articles
[19:43.100 --> 19:49.300]  attacking me in the press about the gun confiscation drills in Arcadia when
[19:49.300 --> 19:52.860]  that's what it is shutting down the city going door to door and asking if they
[19:52.860 --> 19:56.260]  can search their cupboards and houses that's a gun confiscation drill they
[19:56.260 --> 20:02.340]  admit it's quote going after an arms dealer this year many of us will have
[20:02.340 --> 20:06.740]  to make the tough decision on what to cut back on and what's essential as we
[20:06.740 --> 20:10.820]  prepare for an uncertain future in these troubled times one of the most
[20:10.820 --> 20:14.700]  important things your family can have is good health some of the contributors to
[20:14.700 --> 20:19.540]  poor health or parasites viruses toxins and heavy metals it's a documented fact
[20:19.540 --> 20:25.060]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal
[20:25.060 --> 20:29.780]  parasites and parasitic infection now you can fight internal parasites heavy
[20:29.780 --> 20:35.060]  metals and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton

[21:04.060 --> 21:08.700]  terrorist act of war against this country the enemy struck America on
[21:08.700 --> 21:14.440]  September 11th. But who is the enemy? Bin Laden. This is his MO. We have to look to the
[21:14.440 --> 21:18.660]  Middle East we have to look to Osama Bin Laden. Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11
[21:18.660 --> 21:22.060]  film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks
[21:22.060 --> 21:25.860]  inside the United States. Some US investigators believe that there are
[21:25.860 --> 21:31.620]  Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US. I'm aware that
[21:31.620 --> 21:36.620]  some Israeli citizens have been detained. Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the
[21:36.620 --> 21:40.460]  hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli
[21:40.460 --> 21:44.020]  intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much
[21:44.020 --> 21:48.180]  much more. Fabled Enemies get the DVD at infowars.com

[22:00.740 --> 22:04.580]  As many people know ever since President Nixon took us off the gold
[22:04.580 --> 22:07.700]  standard the US dollar has been evaluating. What people don't know
[22:07.700 --> 22:11.500]  however is how this directly affects your personal finances. Is there a way to
[22:11.500 --> 22:15.020]  prevent your portfolios from losing value? The answer to all of this is gold
[22:15.020 --> 22:18.780]  and silver. They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[22:18.780 --> 22:24.380]  If you had had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in
[22:24.380 --> 22:28.980]  1913 and kept them both until now your cash would actually have the buying
[22:28.980 --> 22:33.620]  power of only $4,800 but your gold and silver would have the buying power of
[22:33.620 --> 22:37.940]  $3,000,000. The answer to protecting your assets is simple. Call me John

[24:01.100 --> 24:06.300]  They're exotic and far away places known to tourists for coral reefs and sandy
[24:06.300 --> 24:11.700]  beaches but known to the business world as tax havens with strict bank secrecy and
[24:11.700 --> 24:16.420]  privacy laws where U.S. companies could pay fewer taxes and help wealthy
[24:16.420 --> 24:21.020]  customers avoid taxes too. And guess who's turned up in a new government
[24:21.020 --> 24:26.580]  report about tax havens? 11 giant recipients of your bailout tax dollars.
[24:26.580 --> 24:32.340]  Together they've collected more than $227 billion from Citigroup to Morgan
[24:32.340 --> 24:36.900]  Stanley. Even as they benefit from the tax money they operate hundreds of
[24:36.900 --> 24:41.860]  subsidiaries in places widely known for helping people evade taxes. Although
[24:41.860 --> 24:45.940]  proponents say most business and tax havens is perfectly legal and legitimate
[24:45.940 --> 24:52.140]  it's estimated that tax havens cost U.S. taxpayers $100 billion a year in lost
[24:52.140 --> 24:57.580]  revenue. The stakes are so high this tax haven insider was put under witness
[24:57.580 --> 25:02.420]  protection after he exposed hundreds of tax dodgers and testified to Congress
[25:02.420 --> 25:11.780]  about his job. One favorite among the bailout companies that came in
[25:11.780 --> 25:17.220]  islands where there's no income tax no corporate tax no capital gains tax.
[25:17.220 --> 25:24.260]  Goldman Sachs has 15 subsidiaries there Bank of America 59 Citigroup 90 but
[25:24.260 --> 25:29.220]  Morgan Stanley beats them all with at least 158 subsidiaries in the Cayman
[25:29.220 --> 25:33.900]  Islands seven times the number of hotels. How hard is it for the U.S.
[25:33.900 --> 25:38.580]  government to get at what's going on in some of these tax havens? It's incredibly
[25:38.580 --> 25:41.980]  hard. Former congressional tax investigator Dean Zerbe says the
[25:41.980 --> 25:46.260]  Treasury Department should demand that bailout banks cough up details of their
[25:46.260 --> 25:53.780]  offshore interests. That's good. All right you can watch the whole report we
[25:53.780 --> 25:59.820]  have a link to it up on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com right now. Now you
[25:59.820 --> 26:04.020]  hear those type reports and it's like ooh the news is getting tough on these
[26:04.020 --> 26:10.420]  tax cheats but it is the very brokerage firms and banks that make up the new
[26:10.420 --> 26:13.380]  world order system in their own words you can watch them in during the Davos
[26:13.380 --> 26:16.660]  meeting we had a few weeks ago just open talk of world government now they're
[26:16.660 --> 26:21.820]  gonna run everything. They have two sets of rules one for the public and then one
[26:21.820 --> 26:26.380]  for themselves. Look at Secretary of Treasury Geithner not paying taxes and
[26:26.380 --> 26:31.300]  being confronted with it years ago and saying I'm not gonna pay. Look at the
[26:31.300 --> 26:37.100]  majority of Congress not paying taxes. Just Google that majority of Congress
[26:37.100 --> 26:41.540]  doesn't pay taxes and you can see the reports that come out every year because
[26:41.540 --> 26:46.180]  it's not enforced on themselves and so what's happening is the big central
[26:46.180 --> 26:50.860]  banks have created over 1,000 trillion dollars in derivatives they bought up
[26:50.860 --> 26:55.820]  most the real assets in the world now they want to rob the nouveau riche the
[26:55.820 --> 27:00.060]  new wealth and wealthy people that aren't on the inside with them and I've
[27:00.060 --> 27:05.140]  looked at the UBS raids on tens of thousands of account holders now they
[27:05.140 --> 27:10.260]  want 54,000 more accounts and UBS alone with the Swiss banking system and if you
[27:10.260 --> 27:13.180]  look at these accounts you know they'll be a million dollars ten million
[27:13.180 --> 27:18.140]  dollars it sounds like a big number but these are low level people that put
[27:18.140 --> 27:23.100]  their money in the Swiss banks. The Swiss signed deals was it six years ago
[27:23.100 --> 27:27.820]  with the UN to join the European Union to get rid of their bank secrecy and so
[27:27.820 --> 27:32.420]  that's why you see this happening but the Bahamas the Cayman Islands Portugal
[27:32.420 --> 27:38.020]  the Cook Islands Paraguay the list goes on and on that's where Luxembourg
[27:38.020 --> 27:41.660]  that's where people like Vladimir Putin he has his money has been reported in
[27:41.660 --> 27:46.260]  Luxembourg and a few other places in Europe those aren't being touched and
[27:46.260 --> 27:51.460]  they're not going to be touched so what you have is the elite doesn't like the
[27:51.460 --> 27:55.660]  fact that in the last decade or so even people that only make a few hundred
[27:55.660 --> 28:01.780]  thousand dollars a year in some cases even less started using these tax
[28:01.780 --> 28:06.540]  shelters and these offshore banks because it became retail just you know
[28:06.540 --> 28:10.700]  Main Street tax attorneys began recommending this to people in huge
[28:10.700 --> 28:16.780]  services and so the loophole laws were written where the big banks and brokerage
[28:16.780 --> 28:23.900]  firms are allowed under federal law and that's like Halliburton owns Cayman
[28:23.900 --> 28:28.220]  Islands subsidiaries that came out that were selling nuclear weapons components
[28:28.220 --> 28:36.100]  and oil field equipment to Iraq during the 14 years of sanctions and to Iran
[28:36.100 --> 28:39.860]  you know they even came out mainstream news and Halliburton said well this is
[28:39.860 --> 28:46.220]  completely legal because their lobbyists wrote the laws and so they even got
[28:46.220 --> 28:50.820]  lost past where the federal government would pay tax incentives to offshore
[28:50.820 --> 28:57.540]  industries businesses banks to where they even got tax breaks to pay for the
[28:57.540 --> 29:02.300]  offshoring and so now they're just introducing this to the public and saying
[29:02.300 --> 29:08.300]  oh look your bailout money hundreds of billions of it went to offshore accounts
[29:08.300 --> 29:11.380]  they're just keeping your money well what do you think criminals are going to
[29:11.380 --> 29:16.780]  do they're going to steal this is what the upper crust of the establishment
[29:16.780 --> 29:20.660]  basically a bunch of Bernard Madoff's and then now more and more big Ponzi
[29:20.660 --> 29:24.020]  schemes are coming out and people are discovering that every major bank out
[29:24.020 --> 29:28.420]  there is involved in scams and pension funds are going down the drain this has
[29:28.420 --> 29:32.860]  been planned by design but they don't want you being able to get your money
[29:32.860 --> 29:37.420]  offshore so they're clamping down selectively on the people I'll finish
[29:37.420 --> 29:40.780]  up breaking down how this works we get back then get into headlines like this
[29:40.780 --> 29:46.420]  one from CNN Pennsylvania rocked by jailing kids for cash scandal they do
[29:46.420 --> 29:53.380]  that right here in Austin does anybody care we're on the March the Empire's on

[34:22.180 --> 34:29.420]  and themselves individually pay almost no tax and then they take the public's
[34:29.420 --> 34:34.660]  money in all the taxes we pay and most of that is fenced through into corporate
[34:34.660 --> 34:40.300]  welfare and corporate contracts and open up payment on interest on the debt to
[34:40.300 --> 34:44.620]  the central banks this is how the game is played this is how it works their
[34:44.620 --> 34:48.620]  business their corporate business is controlling governments and taxing you
[34:48.620 --> 34:53.740]  and so we're over a hundred years the big central banks have had offshore
[34:53.740 --> 34:58.340]  corporations and front corporations but as tens of millions of people in the
[34:58.340 --> 35:03.220]  United States even more worldwide the game using these legal loopholes the
[35:03.220 --> 35:09.220]  IRS and the ex-checker over in England and others began going after people
[35:09.220 --> 35:15.220]  selectively and selectively closing those loopholes and selectively
[35:15.220 --> 35:20.180]  prosecuting people and so in the last five years or so many Americans and many
[35:20.180 --> 35:25.100]  British in fact Britain is the fastest to be losing their population have been
[35:25.100 --> 35:29.060]  leaving and moving to these tax havens and that's pan panicking the
[35:29.060 --> 35:36.020]  establishment and so the OECD the organization of economic cooperative
[35:36.020 --> 35:38.860]  development that's the name of the private corporation that was set up to
[35:38.860 --> 35:45.900]  launder all the money from the reconstruction the Marshall plan that
[35:45.900 --> 35:52.460]  was done after World War two they use the similar system in Japan to take over
[35:52.460 --> 35:56.300]  those countries it wasn't rebuilding them for free they're controlled by the
[35:56.300 --> 36:00.940]  central banks the OECD has been saying in big reports that you can pull up and
[36:00.940 --> 36:08.700]  read just Google OECD tax havens tax avoidance havens and they admit their
[36:08.700 --> 36:14.860]  main target is the retail offshore person somebody who just sticks you know
[36:14.860 --> 36:18.980]  over a decade a million two million three million dollars in these offshore
[36:18.980 --> 36:24.900]  tax havens which is totally legal but they don't care through legalese they
[36:24.900 --> 36:29.940]  go after you and so they'll have a CBS news piece like this one saying oh isn't
[36:29.940 --> 36:32.660]  it horrible you know hundreds of billions of dollars the bailout money
[36:32.660 --> 36:37.380]  through the banks and brokerage firms went to these offshore tax havens and the
[36:37.380 --> 36:41.660]  IRS can grandstand like little saviors and go it's not fair people are losing
[36:41.660 --> 36:45.860]  their health care losing their jobs losing their homes and the bailout money
[36:45.860 --> 36:50.620]  went to offshore banks and they're keeping it we need to crack down on
[36:50.620 --> 36:57.100]  these and it's the same thing remember a few weeks ago Obama said I am outraged
[36:57.100 --> 37:02.660]  this is outrageous that we have these banks that are failing and they're
[37:02.660 --> 37:06.220]  keeping the money for big parties and executives and hundreds of billions and
[37:06.220 --> 37:12.300]  bonuses to their executives and I'm putting a total cap on it of $500,000
[37:12.300 --> 37:17.660]  and then you read the executive order it says all of the big banks and the
[37:17.660 --> 37:22.340]  previous recipients are exempt from this and in the future it will be left to
[37:22.340 --> 37:28.940]  agency discretion the Securities and Exchange Commission and others who will
[37:28.940 --> 37:33.020]  be prosecuted under this and then there it doesn't even give any laws or
[37:33.020 --> 37:39.940]  regulations or force of law it just says we'll make up whatever we want
[37:41.900 --> 37:46.660]  you understand how that works and so if you can get a position in government if
[37:46.660 --> 37:49.540]  you can get a position in one of these big banks you can get a position in one
[37:49.540 --> 37:54.140]  of these big brokerage firms you have a license to steal to do whatever you want
[37:54.140 --> 38:00.340]  whenever you want however you want and there's example of this after example of
[38:00.340 --> 38:04.580]  this this is a illegitimate government just like Mexico is an illegitimate
[38:04.580 --> 38:12.300]  government now in full collapse full collapse how many years ago do we tell
[38:12.300 --> 38:20.700]  you that was already in play and this is all by design and I'm gonna cover that
[38:20.700 --> 38:23.300]  more but I want to get to your calls and then I have all these stories you know
[38:23.300 --> 38:26.020]  some of them I've mentioned in the past but now they're getting national
[38:26.020 --> 38:32.500]  attention Pennsylvania rocked by jailing kids for cash millions of dollars per
[38:32.500 --> 38:40.100]  judge from private youth homes that get federal funds for the children and it
[38:40.100 --> 38:45.700]  goes through the cases and you can go you know each article is really a
[38:45.700 --> 38:49.380]  whitewash but if you read 20 or 30 articles on this subject and there's
[38:49.380 --> 38:51.940]  been that many the last three weeks since this broke just in Pennsylvania alone
[38:51.940 --> 38:57.940]  it's going on everywhere and since the story came out my hope it has come through
[38:57.940 --> 39:01.620]  that people are now noticing it's happening in their towns a lot of folks
[39:01.620 --> 39:06.860]  need to go to jail in Austin Texas folks it they're so criminal here it's on
[39:06.860 --> 39:11.780]  record they're paying people off and if you don't like a SWAT team will drop by
[39:11.780 --> 39:19.060]  I mean that's pretty much how it works a girl put up a MySpace account making
[39:19.060 --> 39:28.100]  fun of her principal no cuss words no nothing and she was given six months in
[39:28.100 --> 39:34.940]  a quote forest work camp if you're late to class three times they trigger
[39:34.940 --> 39:39.260]  truancy laws the truancy law doesn't even say three late to classes isn't
[39:39.260 --> 39:42.620]  absence and one absence isn't truancy under any of these state laws they
[39:42.620 --> 39:47.660]  don't care you still go to jail that's what I keep explaining to people I've
[39:47.660 --> 39:52.340]  been at the juvenile court hearings which is a just a made-up fake court set
[39:52.340 --> 39:55.540]  up under the eugenicist in the US a hundred years ago just like they have a
[39:55.540 --> 39:59.420]  court their own court for vaccines funded by the vaccine companies just like
[39:59.420 --> 40:06.260]  Monsanto owns its own court on GMO little rule that when they contaminate you the
[40:06.260 --> 40:09.860]  Missouri court rules that you owe them money because they contaminated your
[40:09.860 --> 40:18.380]  field they write the rules and I have made films about this I've done so many
[40:18.380 --> 40:23.420]  local TV shows about this and no one's brought to justice nobody gets in
[40:23.420 --> 40:27.180]  trouble I mean here in Austin you put your child in a public school you're
[40:27.180 --> 40:31.380]  asking for it they do one thing wrong they raise their voice the police write
[40:31.380 --> 40:37.020]  them a ticket for disturbing the peace then they call them before a judge it's
[40:37.020 --> 40:41.300]  all legalese they order the family to sign an agreement that the child's on
[40:41.300 --> 40:46.340]  probation a contract and the next time your child's late to class they go to
[40:46.340 --> 40:51.460]  jail and then federal and state money kicks in and then if they can say your
[40:51.460 --> 40:55.620]  child's mentally ill and put them on prozac or riddlin they go from getting
[40:55.620 --> 41:00.300]  three or four thousand dollars a month in these facilities to in some cases as
[41:00.300 --> 41:07.060]  much as ten thousand dollars a month and it is just I mean I've had listeners
[41:07.060 --> 41:11.220]  who've investigated this send me the different state agency filings online to
[41:11.220 --> 41:16.700]  show what these big foster care centers make of these private ones and it'll
[41:16.700 --> 41:20.300]  show what the director of one of them makes and it'll be hundreds of
[41:20.300 --> 41:23.780]  millions of dollars when they live in palaces they're driving portions they
[41:23.780 --> 41:30.460]  have yachts so of course they can pay a few mill to a judge now now go back to
[41:30.460 --> 41:35.660]  how many past shows I told you they were doing this now it's in the news
[41:39.660 --> 41:45.820]  Pennsylvania rocked by jailing kids for cash scandal that a friend sleep over
[41:45.820 --> 41:52.140]  more than a year ago 14-year-old Philip Swartley pocketed change from
[41:52.140 --> 41:58.740]  unlocked vehicles in the neighborhood by buying chips and soft drinks the cops
[41:58.740 --> 42:03.980]  caught him there was no need for an attorney said phelps mother Amy Swartley
[42:03.980 --> 42:09.060]  who thought at most the judge would slap her son with a fine or community
[42:09.060 --> 42:13.220]  service but she was shocked to find her eighth grade handcuffed and shackled in
[42:13.220 --> 42:16.660]  the courtroom and sentenced to a youth detention center then he was shipped to
[42:16.660 --> 42:20.940]  a boarding school for troubled teens for nine months now see they give the white
[42:20.940 --> 42:25.060]  wash ones here you go read the local Pennsylvania articles late to class three
[42:25.060 --> 42:32.220]  times posting a joke about the principal under her free speech well it's
[42:32.220 --> 42:37.700]  incredible I covered that last week yes my son made a mistake but I don't think
[42:37.700 --> 42:41.660]  he was going to be taken away from me said Swartley well you put him in a
[42:41.660 --> 42:47.180]  prison camp lady that's meant to induct your child into institutions a 41 year
[42:47.180 --> 42:51.620]  old single mother raising two boys in Wilkes bar Pennsylvania CNN does not
[42:51.620 --> 42:55.140]  usually identify minors accused of crimes but Swartley and others agreed to
[42:55.140 --> 42:58.700]  name to bring public attention to the issue scandals from Wall Street to
[42:58.700 --> 43:03.780]  Washington Royal Public Trust the Justice Department system of Luzarene
[43:03.780 --> 43:07.660]  County in the heart of Pennsylvania struggling coal country has also fallen
[43:07.660 --> 43:12.260]  prey to corruption see folks the criminals to carry out crimes and bid
[43:12.260 --> 43:17.380]  rigging and stealing and double sets of books in every government agency every
[43:17.380 --> 43:20.540]  government agency has a comprehensive annual financial report that was set up
[43:20.540 --> 43:26.380]  by the Mafia in the 20s in Chicago nationally adopted in 1951 1313 model
[43:26.380 --> 43:32.260]  and then they have to recruit more criminals in to their system so that
[43:32.260 --> 43:35.660]  they're protected while they carry out crime and then they can't really say no
[43:35.660 --> 43:39.780]  because they're compromised to the lower level criminals so they all set up their
[43:39.780 --> 43:47.660]  own scams and then society just collapses and it goes on the county has
[43:47.660 --> 43:50.500]  been rocked by a kickback scandal involving two elected judges who
[43:50.500 --> 43:54.180]  essentially jailed kids for cash many of the children had appeared before judges
[43:54.180 --> 43:57.260]  without a lawyer well the courts aren't real these family courts aren't
[43:57.260 --> 44:06.380]  constitutional we didn't have them till about 1920s the few areas had them
[44:06.380 --> 44:13.220]  earlier and they were called racial hygiene courts that's where the social
[44:13.220 --> 44:19.580]  services in the health department it's all designed to kill you see my film
[44:19.580 --> 44:26.260]  in game I have the mainstream newsreel clips that they showed movie theaters
[44:26.260 --> 44:29.780]  about they were sterilizing people in 34 states I mean if you can't make this
[44:29.780 --> 44:35.580]  stuff up the nonprofit juvenile law center in Philadelphia said Philip is
[44:35.580 --> 44:38.340]  one of at least 5,000 children over the past five years who appeared before
[44:38.340 --> 44:47.300]  former loserine County judge Mark Civerilla he's now pled guilty and then
[44:47.300 --> 44:51.140]  it just goes into the story here about the private juvenile detention centers
[44:51.140 --> 44:57.820]  owned by Mid-Atlantic Youth Services Corps they're still operating and are
[44:57.820 --> 45:00.900]  not a target of the federal investigation of course not according to
[45:00.900 --> 45:04.260]  court documents they're going to be left alone and it goes through all the
[45:04.260 --> 45:12.100]  payoffs that were made and then it just goes into the reason the kids were put
[45:12.100 --> 45:16.540]  in jail but this CNN's a whitewash go read the local reports late to class
[45:16.540 --> 45:24.020]  three times six months in a forest labor camp forest work camp oh you said
[45:24.020 --> 45:29.740]  something on an internet site no first amendment six months in jail a year in
[45:29.740 --> 45:34.260]  jail and then you read what happened to these kids some of them die in custody
[45:34.260 --> 45:38.020]  others come out totally mind-blown they hop them up they're away from their
[45:38.020 --> 45:41.380]  parents they're on Prozac Ritalin they start having seizures and they put them
[45:41.380 --> 45:45.580]  in a mental institution oh then the cash really racks up and after the kids
[45:45.580 --> 45:51.020]  done 18 years old totally brain fried shock therapy they throw them out on
[45:51.020 --> 45:54.660]  the street and that's the people you laugh at that have the sign saying we'll
[45:54.660 --> 45:59.140]  work for food most of them aren't even why knows I've talked to them they've
[45:59.140 --> 46:03.260]  been in mental institutions and I go tell me your story well I was 12 I got
[46:03.260 --> 46:09.020]  the fist fight and they you know the guy was 32 looks like he's 60 I do
[46:09.020 --> 46:13.260]  documentary on these guys and I got in a fight at the back of the school and
[46:13.260 --> 46:18.700]  then they put me in juvenile and started drugging me I know I'm crazy I deserve
[46:18.700 --> 46:23.460]  it they shock me over and over again and then let me guess when you're ready to
[46:23.460 --> 46:32.020]  let you go yeah I've been on the street since then that's your sickening
[46:32.020 --> 46:38.220]  degenerate government hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars the
[46:38.220 --> 46:45.100]  more drugs the more shock therapy the more torture the more thorazine that's
[46:45.100 --> 46:53.420]  why 67% of US foster children can Google that are on more than one
[46:53.420 --> 46:57.580]  psychotropic drug because when they seize your child and then hop them up on
[46:57.580 --> 47:01.460]  drugs the money just starts going ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding
[47:01.460 --> 47:05.340]  ding I mean that cash right or chiching chiching chiching chiching just goes off
[47:05.340 --> 47:14.780]  the charts and the cash rolls in all right that's enough I said I'd go to your
[47:14.780 --> 47:17.980]  calls and I'm gonna take them all through this hour into the next and then I'm
[47:17.980 --> 47:22.940]  gonna get into we have a state senator coming on who's talking about state
[47:22.940 --> 47:27.500]  sovereignty and putting troops on the border through the state of Texas we've
[47:27.500 --> 47:34.340]  got another guest on this issue as well
[47:34.340 --> 47:39.620]  Dr. Edwin Vieira but I mentioned this yesterday I didn't spend enough time on
[47:39.620 --> 47:43.300]  it sometime today I've got to get into it because I was called a conspiracy
[47:43.300 --> 47:47.620]  theorist I was laughed at I've been attacked everywhere for this even though
[47:47.620 --> 47:53.180]  I had Australian lawmakers on I had federal congressman on I had state
[47:53.180 --> 47:57.700]  reps on who discovered this I remember hearing when I first got on talk radio
[47:57.700 --> 48:01.740]  13 years ago that when they take blood from babies heels the hospital it went
[48:01.740 --> 48:06.340]  into a UN database well I decided to go down at that time to the micro fish at
[48:06.340 --> 48:11.300]  the UT library one of the best in the country and I pulled it all up and found
[48:11.300 --> 48:15.260]  out it was going into DNA testing that they claim that they own your blood they
[48:15.260 --> 48:19.380]  then patent your blood there's now been federal cases where you go in when you
[48:19.380 --> 48:23.540]  get cancer they give to you in the vaccines and you want your own DNA
[48:23.540 --> 48:26.660]  treatment you find out oh a company's already patented your blood that's why
[48:26.660 --> 48:30.500]  this is starting to come out you got to pay them to be able to have this gene
[48:30.500 --> 48:34.100]  therapy and they go how'd you get my blood well it's part of a research
[48:34.100 --> 48:38.500]  project and then and that's finally in the news but that's only one facet they
[48:38.500 --> 48:44.340]  also now have your blood large ampules of it freeze dried to plant and the FBI
[48:44.340 --> 48:47.740]  crime lab on record under Frederick Wildhurst admits it was industrialized
[48:47.740 --> 48:51.180]  fraud they just frame everybody the Houston crime lab has been caught the
[48:51.180 --> 48:55.220]  Dallas crime lab every major crime lab and they have your blood that's why
[48:55.220 --> 48:59.100]  they're trying to push national DNA databases now for people they didn't
[48:59.100 --> 49:04.500]  get in the system who aren't 36 or younger 35 or younger and they bill it as
[49:04.500 --> 49:09.980]  oh we're freeing a lot of innocent people on death row because of DNA and
[49:09.980 --> 49:15.940]  the police want to take your blood for misdemeanors at checkpoints now for any
[49:15.940 --> 49:20.860]  you know basic misdemeanor so so they can take good care of you I'm sure hey
[49:20.860 --> 49:25.620]  cops they're gonna you're a good cop wonder how they're gonna frame you well
[49:25.620 --> 49:29.420]  they can they can place your fingerprints at the scene by having everybody
[49:29.420 --> 49:34.140]  knows that they can frame you with that blood you know I believe OJ Simpson was
[49:34.140 --> 49:39.380]  probably guilty but I'm not gonna wait in on that debate he was certainly
[49:39.380 --> 49:43.860]  covering something up but the police did get caught planting the blood why
[49:43.860 --> 49:49.860]  because it has the MBTE blood
[49:49.860 --> 49:57.540]  preservative in it so it doesn't rot and it also had the plastic chemicals in it
[49:57.540 --> 50:02.340]  from the tube so you know that came out the point is this is to frame you now
[50:02.340 --> 50:05.580]  now that's not the biggest problem you've heard about this human genome
[50:05.580 --> 50:10.300]  project that's at the Colesprings Harbor that's where the eugenics records
[50:10.300 --> 50:16.260]  office is the same building IBM runs that founded to carry out eugenics it's a
[50:16.260 --> 50:22.980]  trust to carry out eugenics you know big supporters of Hitler they had the
[50:22.980 --> 50:26.220]  holler with machines for IBM used by Hitler to decide who to kill and who not
[50:26.220 --> 50:30.660]  to kill with their date of birth or weight and all the rest of it well now
[50:30.660 --> 50:33.500]  they have with the National Geographic who I'm sure is unaware of even though
[50:33.500 --> 50:41.420]  they're eugenics a lot of them it's founded by Genesis to go around the
[50:41.420 --> 50:44.780]  world quote testing your roots getting you to donate your blood to find out
[50:44.780 --> 50:48.620]  who's ready to who that's being done because with the race specific bio
[50:48.620 --> 50:54.220]  weapons they found were all related they're trying to isolate subtypes so
[50:54.220 --> 51:00.780]  they can more orderly kill 99% of the population stay with us
[51:00.780 --> 51:05.620]  heart disease is on the rise clogged arteries high blood pressure and high
[51:05.620 --> 51:09.740]  cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you but the symptoms are

[54:25.780 --> 54:30.900]  dangerous place in the world but parents still let their high school seniors and
[54:30.900 --> 54:34.580]  college students that are paying for people say well they're college kids
[54:34.580 --> 54:38.260]  well you're paying for their education go to Mexico's they can be robbed and
[54:38.260 --> 54:44.900]  shot up and Mexico is collapsing that's coming up but right now let's go to your
[54:44.900 --> 54:52.740]  calls Frankie in New York welcome good afternoon Alex I just wanted to make a
[54:52.740 --> 54:58.300]  couple comments and I thought your analysis was very interesting it's
[54:58.300 --> 55:04.500]  always for the bankers the tax avoidance versus tax evasion and when you
[55:04.500 --> 55:09.140]  have a corrupt government that has a very complex and burdensome burdensome
[55:09.140 --> 55:13.980]  tax code is the United States has. Quarter million pages. Whoever has the best legal
[55:13.980 --> 55:18.340]  counsel and the biggest assets usually can get away with the tax avoidance yet
[55:18.340 --> 55:23.620]  the small individual with a simple mistake you know gets nailed for tax
[55:23.620 --> 55:28.980]  evasion it's always the way it seems at least in the United States and the very
[55:28.980 --> 55:32.460]  wealthy families from the beginning such as the Rockefellers the Ford the
[55:32.460 --> 55:36.900]  DuPont before the income tax law was set up they were able through their
[55:36.900 --> 55:40.980]  attorneys to set up tax exempt foundations and trusts that prevented
[55:40.980 --> 55:47.260]  them from having to pay their burden you know that they should have paid yeah
[55:47.260 --> 55:51.700]  it's only for the idiot public in their words to pay absolutely and what I
[55:51.700 --> 55:57.100]  wanted to say to all of this talk about talk about the carbon tax I find really
[55:57.100 --> 56:04.180]  dangerous and kind of ridiculous I think what we should well sir sir sir it's
[56:04.180 --> 56:09.180]  not talk I know mama has announced yesterday they are implementing it
[56:09.180 --> 56:14.700]  yes but here's what should happen I think the Rockefellers the DuPont the
[56:14.700 --> 56:22.540]  Rothschild the Nobel the royal family in England the Dutch royal family with
[56:22.540 --> 56:28.860]  Dutch shell the descendants of Armand Hammer including Al Gore who's one of
[56:28.860 --> 56:33.420]  the biggest shareholders in Occidental petroleum these companies over the last
[56:33.420 --> 56:40.140]  200 to the last 70 years of rape the world caused these problems and they've
[56:40.140 --> 56:46.060]  been able to profit handsomely by that before we talk about enforcing a global
[56:46.060 --> 56:52.660]  carbon tax on the population it's time to tax those who rape the planet and when
[56:52.660 --> 56:56.420]  their assets are diminished then maybe we can discuss taxing the general
[56:56.420 --> 57:00.380]  population well I agree with you that has to be done you know you know Al Gore is
[57:00.380 --> 57:04.580]  the majority shareholder he's one of the directors of Occidental petroleum the
[57:04.580 --> 57:08.260]  actually owns a company also involved chopping down rainforest but see that's
[57:08.260 --> 57:14.140]  the cover that's like when Prescott Bush it came out was the top Nazi agent in
[57:14.140 --> 57:19.860]  the US he hurriedly founded the the group that goes out and you know has
[57:19.860 --> 57:24.620]  Hollywood people and musicians the USO not to the military because oh it's
[57:24.620 --> 57:29.260]  impossible at the top Nazi is you know bringing us all this entertainment and
[57:29.260 --> 57:34.900]  so exactly you will be one of the major carbon trading companies is owned by Al
[57:34.900 --> 57:39.780]  Gore he is the principal in that and you will pay your carbon taxes to Al Gore
[57:39.780 --> 57:43.900]  it's very very funny to him and instead of people worrying about all the real
[57:43.900 --> 57:48.140]  environmental crises and serious problems there are we'll sit there and
[57:48.140 --> 57:51.740]  elective these guys rip us off but the public likes to be schmucks that's why
[57:51.740 --> 57:54.820]  they're gonna lose their houses and everything else they've got me that's
[57:54.820 --> 58:00.900]  the case but I think right now what's interesting Alex is people are losing
[58:00.900 --> 58:04.500]  their jobs and they have no income to pay the bankers are ruthless they will
[58:04.500 --> 58:08.420]  give us no quarter and the public still says hurt me hurt me more hurt me I love
[58:08.420 --> 58:12.780]  to be a schmuck please hurt me well hopefully is the people lose their
[58:12.780 --> 58:17.820]  assets their savings they'll wise up very quickly and I think they will want
[58:17.820 --> 58:21.980]  their time to flesh when they're right Frank I hear you and I appreciate your
[58:21.980 --> 58:25.460]  call yeah a lot of people are actually waking up and others still cozy up to

[1:00:19.860 --> 1:00:26.380]  alex jones all right we just had a great caller earlier but I want to attempt
[1:00:26.380 --> 1:00:31.700]  to take a call every two minutes or so so I got a lot of people in we have Dr.
[1:00:31.700 --> 1:00:34.660]  Evan Vieira coming up to get into the states rights rebellion against
[1:00:34.660 --> 1:00:38.380]  tyranny you also have a state senator from Texas making national headlines about
[1:00:38.380 --> 1:00:42.300]  putting Texas guard and state police on the border because the feds won't do it
[1:00:42.300 --> 1:00:46.220]  that is coming up and right now let's go to Matt in Canada Matt you're on the
[1:00:46.220 --> 1:00:51.820]  air hello alex good day hello good day to you my friend I was just wondering I
[1:00:51.820 --> 1:00:55.540]  heard you talking before in a lot of previous episodes that a lot of you are
[1:00:55.540 --> 1:00:59.420]  films are actually getting through to Canada through the mail I was wondering
[1:00:59.420 --> 1:01:04.140]  if this is going to be the same thing with Obama deception well I talked to my
[1:01:04.140 --> 1:01:09.900]  shipping guys and they explained to me two days ago that it isn't as bad as it
[1:01:09.900 --> 1:01:13.560]  used to be before half the time they would tear up the package break the
[1:01:13.560 --> 1:01:18.420]  tape send it back we would even mail them as bulk groups in two customs and
[1:01:18.420 --> 1:01:21.820]  then they would inspect the main bulk and then it would go out from UPS and
[1:01:21.820 --> 1:01:25.700]  then they would still send those back but we told UPS that if they didn't
[1:01:25.700 --> 1:01:29.180]  pressure Canada and didn't fix it and we even tried some other companies we
[1:01:29.180 --> 1:01:33.540]  weren't going to do it anymore and I'm told that now about 95% are making it
[1:01:33.540 --> 1:01:38.940]  into Canada so things have a suddenly gotten a lot better in the last six
[1:01:38.940 --> 1:01:43.660]  months so I was brought up to speed on that but but still Canada is the
[1:01:43.660 --> 1:01:49.620]  hardest place in the world to get our videos into also a lot of it is we've
[1:01:49.620 --> 1:01:54.340]  changed the name on the package that we ship out on so that that may be helping
[1:01:54.340 --> 1:01:59.700]  yeah definitely I was also wondering have you ever heard of eye doser it's a
[1:01:59.700 --> 1:02:06.060]  music no basically I thought it would be a really great medium for waking people
[1:02:06.060 --> 1:02:11.060]  up what it is it's basically just on random tones played and basically it
[1:02:11.060 --> 1:02:15.740]  gives you the effect of either like a mild antidepressant a strong antidepressant
[1:02:15.740 --> 1:02:19.500]  or even painkillers and other things like that yeah I've read about the power
[1:02:19.500 --> 1:02:24.620]  of music to either heighten mental awareness or lower it and so I am aware
[1:02:24.620 --> 1:02:29.020]  of that yes I am aware of the power of sound well any of your listeners who
[1:02:29.020 --> 1:02:34.300]  have family members who really are sort of still skeptical about the power of
[1:02:34.300 --> 1:02:38.300]  media control and mind control anything like that I highly recommend them to
[1:02:38.300 --> 1:02:41.860]  check out the eye doser because it's some of them are only five minute long
[1:02:41.860 --> 1:02:46.180]  songs and you can really it a song with random tones will just start to make you
[1:02:46.180 --> 1:02:50.340]  laugh and giggle because that's what it's meant to do I tell what John go pull
[1:02:50.340 --> 1:02:54.500]  an eye doser up off of YouTube and we'll play one later thank you Matt Eric and
[1:02:54.500 --> 1:03:00.820]  Texas you're on the air you doing today good sir all right I just had a quick
[1:03:00.820 --> 1:03:04.660]  question for you I don't know if you've heard about this yet I'm a police officer
[1:03:04.660 --> 1:03:11.620]  here in Texas okay house resolution 748 the campus safety act of 2009 mm-hmm
[1:03:11.620 --> 1:03:17.060]  basically what it it entails is basically the federal takeover of all
[1:03:17.060 --> 1:03:21.660]  the campus police agency in the United States yes it federalizes all of the
[1:03:21.660 --> 1:03:26.900]  colleges that's what Homeland Security is going to do under this FEMA camp bill
[1:03:26.900 --> 1:03:30.540]  they were to build the FEMA camps it makes the local police go under its
[1:03:30.540 --> 1:03:35.300]  control this is sir PDD 51 all of them John Warner Defense Authorization Act
[1:03:35.300 --> 1:03:40.260]  everything's being federalized and then you will be a federal officer under
[1:03:40.260 --> 1:03:44.540]  their control and then they're going to fire most of the police I'm not trying
[1:03:44.540 --> 1:03:48.380]  to scare cops this is the truth and bring in mercenaries they're going to
[1:03:48.380 --> 1:03:52.220]  then give it to their own private companies they own and then even pay
[1:03:52.220 --> 1:03:55.340]  more so a lot of you'll be able to get jobs you but you're just going to be
[1:03:55.340 --> 1:03:59.220]  working for them now yeah that's kind of a concern that a lot of us are having

[1:04:16.300 --> 1:04:23.020]  million it seems as though at least to us that this is a replacement force for

[1:08:12.700 --> 1:08:20.180]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[1:08:20.180 --> 1:08:28.460]  alex jones let me just briefly explain what happened we'll go back to Eric and
[1:08:28.460 --> 1:08:35.100]  Texas a peace officer firearms instructor I guess armorer would be the
[1:08:35.100 --> 1:08:44.500]  term properly used give him the Greek name Festus the armorer for Vulcan but
[1:08:44.500 --> 1:08:53.980]  that's a little bit of a little bit of the old system look this is how it works
[1:08:53.980 --> 1:09:01.380]  okay the bankers took over in 1913 then the mafia set up a system the bankers
[1:09:01.380 --> 1:09:05.540]  liked where they took over Chicago and Illinois this is all on record and they
[1:09:05.540 --> 1:09:11.660]  learned to take about 65% now it's more than 80% and growing of all the county
[1:09:11.660 --> 1:09:15.660]  city water district school district money and they have a double set of books
[1:09:15.660 --> 1:09:18.620]  they talk about the budget and put the pensions on the budget and all of that
[1:09:18.620 --> 1:09:23.220]  and then they invest I mean here in Austin almost all of the bond proposals
[1:09:23.220 --> 1:09:27.020]  they pass never get spent on that you look back at stuff bonds past 30 years
[1:09:27.020 --> 1:09:31.740]  ago where the money just disappeared I mean it's just organized crime folks it's
[1:09:31.740 --> 1:09:38.940]  so huge people have trouble believing it because it's so massive then we talk
[1:09:38.940 --> 1:09:41.820]  about it and it's kind of like Jagger Hoover said it's a conspiracy theory
[1:09:41.820 --> 1:09:45.460]  before Congress La Cosa Nostra the mafia doesn't exist well they've been
[1:09:45.460 --> 1:09:48.620]  telling you the new world order doesn't exist they talk to us like we're
[1:09:48.620 --> 1:09:55.180]  idiots and so they've been privatizing and the sucker police in about 15 years
[1:09:55.180 --> 1:10:00.900]  ago they started paying $180,000 for police officers but it was very selective
[1:10:00.900 --> 1:10:04.420]  and it was elite and you know they know how to make it oh so cool like oh
[1:10:04.420 --> 1:10:07.940]  Hollywood people are getting microchips for their kids then everybody wants it
[1:10:07.940 --> 1:10:13.740]  same thing with police oh you get 180 grand if you go join you know some of
[1:10:13.740 --> 1:10:17.940]  these mercenary groups and go overseas well then you know now they've got it
[1:10:17.940 --> 1:10:22.660]  down to about 40 50 grand and they cheat them and don't even pay them now that
[1:10:22.660 --> 1:10:26.220]  they've got everybody ready to do this now that everybody's accepted it now
[1:10:26.220 --> 1:10:31.860]  that the peace officer associations and lobbies and unions didn't challenge it
[1:10:31.860 --> 1:10:36.460]  now they're fully imploding it and there they've got black water on in
[1:10:36.460 --> 1:10:41.780]  California rating medical marijuana distilleries dispensaries excuse me they
[1:10:41.780 --> 1:10:45.380]  have got them involved you know you'll hear about fugitive man hunts with black
[1:10:45.380 --> 1:10:49.700]  water involved and all these private prisons and private youth halls holding
[1:10:49.700 --> 1:10:55.060]  the kids and paying off judges to put them in jail for no reason and notice
[1:10:55.060 --> 1:11:01.060]  that Obama announced that I'm going to the caller that in this banker takeover
[1:11:01.060 --> 1:11:06.500]  bill and then now in the stimulus $19 million to federalize all health care
[1:11:06.500 --> 1:11:11.860]  health care regulations a federal board all health care records are without a
[1:11:11.860 --> 1:11:16.180]  warrant or anything are instantly uploaded through the computers by law and
[1:11:16.180 --> 1:11:20.340]  then we pay for it in the taxes and then they pay for it again in health care
[1:11:20.340 --> 1:11:24.660]  going up for the cost of these systems all of that is uploaded to feds and
[1:11:24.660 --> 1:11:28.700]  they're federalizing the states they're federalizing police they're building
[1:11:28.700 --> 1:11:34.100]  federal emergency management threat integration fusion centers and multi
[1:11:34.100 --> 1:11:37.740]  county areas and they go we've got free office space for your police we've got
[1:11:37.740 --> 1:11:41.300]  free office space we're going to deputize you as a federal officer and
[1:11:41.300 --> 1:11:44.180]  then all the national guards going to be here now and all the army is going to be
[1:11:44.180 --> 1:11:48.140]  here now and all the Marines are here to help you run checkpoints so this is
[1:11:48.140 --> 1:11:52.900]  martial law takeover in slow motion and yes this bill moving its way along
[1:11:52.900 --> 1:11:58.660]  through the federal Congress openly federalizes all of the colleges in the
[1:11:58.660 --> 1:12:06.300]  country and then takes control of the colleges peace officers who would
[1:12:06.300 --> 1:12:12.060]  before been chartered under the state and so now I go back to Eric a police
[1:12:12.060 --> 1:12:16.820]  officer Eric I go ahead yes sir let me throw this out at you too you're asking
[1:12:16.820 --> 1:12:21.220]  about drills and and things like that now any peace officer in Texas is going
[1:12:21.220 --> 1:12:24.100]  to be able to recognize this because it's mandatory training that we've been
[1:12:24.100 --> 1:12:28.180]  having to go for about the past two years it's the national incident
[1:12:28.180 --> 1:12:32.340]  management system which is basically put out I guess from Homeland Security
[1:12:32.340 --> 1:12:38.860]  after the hole 9-11 deal basically and that basically what it is it teaches
[1:12:38.860 --> 1:12:42.780]  every police officer in the state I'm sure it's probably nationwide too that
[1:12:42.780 --> 1:12:46.740]  when the guys with the gold badges meaning the FBI or whoever show up those
[1:12:46.740 --> 1:12:51.660]  are now our new bosses okay in any kind of emergency situation anything like
[1:12:51.660 --> 1:12:55.940]  that well being one of the instructors in our department I was told here about
[1:12:55.940 --> 1:13:01.860]  three months ago by my lieutenant to expect to begin making returns on all
[1:13:01.860 --> 1:13:05.860]  this federal money that our department has been getting okay and I'm asking him
[1:13:05.860 --> 1:13:10.660]  now what do you mean by this his issue was that since we've been taking money
[1:13:10.660 --> 1:13:15.900]  from the federal government they're now starting to expect drills to be run that
[1:13:15.900 --> 1:13:20.140]  they have already pre-organized they've already preached what kind of drills that
[1:13:20.140 --> 1:13:24.620]  these are going to be and start running them in the community that we serve yes
[1:13:24.620 --> 1:13:29.540]  and that'll be lockdown drills you've seen the city of Austin now there's a
[1:13:29.540 --> 1:13:33.660]  shooting even after the shooters have been caught they'll lock down in large
[1:13:33.660 --> 1:13:37.900]  area of Austin and tell people stay in their homes and the officers are
[1:13:37.900 --> 1:13:42.500]  compartmentalized but that's federal funding but I don't want officers to
[1:13:42.500 --> 1:13:46.100]  not believe me here because this is so insane and most departments haven't done
[1:13:46.100 --> 1:13:51.420]  this yet but it's going on in every major state for at least a decade they pull
[1:13:51.420 --> 1:13:55.100]  up at the schools unannounced they load elementary students with their hands up
[1:13:55.100 --> 1:13:59.340]  on buses and take them to a local FEMA center training the children with
[1:13:59.340 --> 1:14:03.380]  learned helplessness in other cases they'll blow up a car in the parking
[1:14:03.380 --> 1:14:07.220]  lot scare the middle school students and this was in the Associated Press in
[1:14:07.220 --> 1:14:11.020]  Michigan and I've seen other states you can go pull it up this this is word for
[1:14:11.020 --> 1:14:15.820]  word I mean I'm paraphrasing but this is what the article said word for word
[1:14:15.820 --> 1:14:20.620]  that they they they brought out the middle schoolers in the parking lot they
[1:14:20.620 --> 1:14:25.340]  set off smoke grenades in the bus and they had police dressed up in camo run
[1:14:25.340 --> 1:14:30.740]  up and scream we're going to kill you and throw fake blood on them terrorizing
[1:14:30.740 --> 1:14:35.340]  the students this is on record and saying we are from the home schoolers
[1:14:35.340 --> 1:14:39.420]  against public education group and then they aim guns at the children till they
[1:14:39.420 --> 1:14:44.220]  cry and then literally crap themselves was in the story now I had another lady
[1:14:44.220 --> 1:14:48.140]  on it from a Minneapolis a few years ago with her lawyer this was in the
[1:14:48.140 --> 1:14:54.780]  Minneapolis you know St. Paul newspaper the star it said in there that they
[1:14:54.780 --> 1:14:57.060]  went in the portable buildings unannounced the SWAT team under a
[1:14:57.060 --> 1:15:02.260]  federally funded drill said we're terrorist put your hands up and they
[1:15:02.260 --> 1:15:05.740]  walked the teacher and the students out and said we're going to execute you
[1:15:05.740 --> 1:15:11.180]  prepare to die and a bunch of the kids defecated urinated the woman had a
[1:15:11.180 --> 1:15:15.180]  mental break had to be hospitalized and some of the other teachers had to be
[1:15:15.180 --> 1:15:20.820]  hospitalized and so see this is criminal it's the same thing they do but don't
[1:15:20.820 --> 1:15:24.860]  believe me pull up the articles please I want people to know this is real I know
[1:15:24.860 --> 1:15:29.500]  it sounds insane let's see they started him before that with oh we're just going
[1:15:29.500 --> 1:15:32.260]  to have a drill when no kids are there taking over the school and then oh we're
[1:15:32.260 --> 1:15:35.020]  gonna do it while the kids are there and then we're gonna do it like this and I
[1:15:35.020 --> 1:15:40.140]  have film of this going on in places like Belton with with with army there
[1:15:40.140 --> 1:15:45.140]  telling us turn our cameras off so if you study Soviet reeducation camps they
[1:15:45.140 --> 1:15:49.100]  would do this in a sports stadium beat up certain people scare folks have scary
[1:15:49.100 --> 1:15:52.660]  movies playing the best examples in the movie red dawn it's fictitious but that's
[1:15:52.660 --> 1:15:57.060]  exactly how they run and it's meant to freak everybody out break them down make
[1:15:57.060 --> 1:16:03.620]  people go crazy but also brainwash the cops and to identify which departments
[1:16:03.620 --> 1:16:07.980]  will do this type of insane stuff go ahead let me throw this out and I know
[1:16:07.980 --> 1:16:11.860]  you've got a tight schedule of colors I just want to throw this out to all my
[1:16:11.860 --> 1:16:16.140]  fellow peace officers here in Texas you guys had better wake up and remember the
[1:16:16.140 --> 1:16:21.700]  oath that you took when you put that badge on to uphold the Constitution of
[1:16:21.700 --> 1:16:26.660]  the United States not of Texas as well because when it comes down to it and when
[1:16:26.660 --> 1:16:30.140]  it comes down to it they're not going to show any more mercy on us and they're
[1:16:30.140 --> 1:16:34.380]  going to show anybody else well let me say this officer we've got time for it
[1:16:34.380 --> 1:16:37.020]  because I'm gonna get to Eric and Steven Randy and others but it's important
[1:16:37.020 --> 1:16:42.700]  when police and military call in look at history every time tyranny comes to your
[1:16:42.700 --> 1:16:45.980]  door it's in a uniform we're not saying that people that want to be police
[1:16:45.980 --> 1:16:51.220]  officers are bad we're saying corrupt governments use police to carry out their
[1:16:51.220 --> 1:16:57.460]  criminal aims and they are federalizing the police publicly and what is the
[1:16:57.460 --> 1:17:02.020]  federal government it's openly a pack of criminals announcing world government
[1:17:02.020 --> 1:17:06.180]  and a new super bank in Time Magazine and Newsweek in the Wall Street Journal
[1:17:06.180 --> 1:17:10.820]  that is going to rule America I mean there's no more time for denial is what
[1:17:10.820 --> 1:17:16.140]  I'm saying this is now in our face I agree absolutely Alex I appreciate what
[1:17:16.140 --> 1:17:21.820]  you do just to give you a little idea what's going on where we're slowly
[1:17:21.820 --> 1:17:24.620]  getting the word out through your videos at least through our department
[1:17:24.620 --> 1:17:28.220]  there's a group of us that are doing this and I'm hoping it's taking place in
[1:17:28.220 --> 1:17:31.460]  other departments across this country what percentage of your department do you
[1:17:31.460 --> 1:17:37.340]  think are waking up it's very small right now very small because it's one of
[1:17:37.340 --> 1:17:41.900]  those things I don't know when you're a police officer you get in wrong with the
[1:17:41.900 --> 1:17:45.900]  administration and it's your brother on the line you know Jack McLean yeah he
[1:17:45.900 --> 1:17:49.500]  had a lot of wisdom in what he was saying becoming the most fired officer
[1:17:49.500 --> 1:17:53.780]  in the history of his department and that can easily happen the police chiefs
[1:17:53.780 --> 1:17:58.580]  in our country they are sold out I can tell you that right now they are sold
[1:17:58.580 --> 1:18:02.700]  out now I say that big big city police chiefs and and medium-sized
[1:18:02.700 --> 1:18:07.300]  departments absolutely but the small town police chiefs I don't know why do
[1:18:07.300 --> 1:18:13.100]  you think the Austin police chief keeps cozying up to me it's a good question I
[1:18:13.100 --> 1:18:17.340]  was actually in a training seminar that he was one of the speakers in seem like
[1:18:17.340 --> 1:18:22.540]  a totally likable guy you know I guess but he came from California I think he
[1:18:22.540 --> 1:18:26.380]  came from the California how we patrol the night in Austin so he's got a very
[1:18:26.380 --> 1:18:35.380]  different idea of policing than what I would consider Texas type of policing
[1:18:35.380 --> 1:18:39.220]  and now I don't know about the stuff we can now once they have the precedent set
[1:18:39.220 --> 1:18:42.940]  to make you go to all these federal training things you know we've had other
[1:18:42.940 --> 1:18:46.500]  emergency managers on it and played tapes of interviews with them or then it
[1:18:46.500 --> 1:18:50.220]  turns into mass graves and we've got to fight the American people and we're
[1:18:50.220 --> 1:18:53.460]  getting ready ready for martial law and that's why when you talk to even
[1:18:53.460 --> 1:18:56.580]  National Guard people or compartmentalized they go we're just going
[1:18:56.580 --> 1:19:00.140]  door-to-door asking to search people's houses it's just for Afghanistan but then
[1:19:00.140 --> 1:19:03.620]  you hear the commander go we need to convince the public to trust us and
[1:19:03.620 --> 1:19:10.460]  we're here to learn the local area this is for America folks absolutely and
[1:19:10.460 --> 1:19:15.900]  that's absolutely correct the I don't know I know a lot of military guys I've
[1:19:15.900 --> 1:19:19.980]  trained with a lot of military guys to do our tactics programs and things like
[1:19:19.980 --> 1:19:27.060]  that one of the big things is the incorporation of military trainers into
[1:19:27.060 --> 1:19:30.780]  police training especially in the area of tactics firearms and things like that
[1:19:30.780 --> 1:19:35.980]  and there's some concern amongst police officer trainers that that is really
[1:19:35.980 --> 1:19:40.060]  undermining the sovereignty the local sovereignty of the community that we
[1:19:40.060 --> 1:19:43.980]  serve when you have military trainers teaching military tactics military style
[1:19:43.980 --> 1:19:49.740]  rules of engagement it undermines it absolutely undermines the local
[1:19:49.740 --> 1:19:52.900]  controller police that's right call us back again officer good to hear from you
[1:19:52.900 --> 1:19:56.580]  the military kills people and breaks things peace officers defend the

[1:24:17.100 --> 1:24:25.900]  yes sir all right first of all I'm a dot TV member and just got my team tyranny
[1:24:25.900 --> 1:24:29.380]  response t-shirt and I love all that stuff the bumper stickers that came with
[1:24:29.380 --> 1:24:34.740]  it thank you thank you for the support sir well I really want to touch on
[1:24:34.740 --> 1:24:37.140]  something that I think is really serious and bring it back to the forefront
[1:24:37.140 --> 1:24:41.260]  something that you brought up yesterday I was actually on hold pacing back and
[1:24:41.260 --> 1:24:45.340]  forth trying to bring it up and then you sure enough brought it up about Glen
[1:24:45.340 --> 1:24:50.500]  Beck and and others and what I'll say is is you know everybody remembers how
[1:24:50.500 --> 1:24:54.980]  faker politicians like Huckabee and others will pretend to stand for things
[1:24:54.980 --> 1:24:59.660]  you know by mimicking certain rhetoric directly from the mouth of other well
[1:24:59.660 --> 1:25:05.340]  meaning and well respected leaders like oh yeah Beck says I woke up and then his
[1:25:05.340 --> 1:25:08.780]  answer is we've got to attack Iran and arrest Ron Paul supporters but then he
[1:25:08.780 --> 1:25:13.580]  supports Ron Paul yeah I think it's really dangerous though because it really
[1:25:13.580 --> 1:25:18.220]  just puts everybody's brain into a blender notice he first came on Fox a
[1:25:18.220 --> 1:25:23.180]  month ago hardcore sounded like it was Alex Jones and already he's gone into
[1:25:23.180 --> 1:25:27.260]  New World Order he gets your confidence Bill O'Reilly I used to watch Bill O'Reilly
[1:25:27.260 --> 1:25:31.580]  like ten years ago on Fox it was the Illuminati the New World Order he only
[1:25:31.580 --> 1:25:35.420]  did it for about a year well I have a quick comment about it I mean just to
[1:25:35.420 --> 1:25:38.300]  bring to the forefront because I've been studying him since he went to Fox the
[1:25:38.300 --> 1:25:42.740]  last month and you know although they're all paid actor idiots and you know I
[1:25:42.740 --> 1:25:46.180]  think Glenn Beck and other news characters are studying you like you said
[1:25:46.180 --> 1:25:50.820]  and like these top-up you know radio broadcasters are telling you it's your
[1:25:50.820 --> 1:25:54.540]  time has come you know I've watched you over the years over the last ten years
[1:25:54.540 --> 1:25:58.940]  kind of walk through hell and back and really take on this responsibility now
[1:25:58.940 --> 1:26:02.820]  where you know how to disseminate this information and people are looking for
[1:26:02.820 --> 1:26:06.540]  this information and so you've got a guy like him that spins off their own
[1:26:06.540 --> 1:26:12.660]  version of the truth let me be specific back has back has our guests are very
[1:26:12.660 --> 1:26:17.060]  guest on within two days of us having them on I've talked to folks at Fox news
[1:26:17.060 --> 1:26:20.540]  they are listening they are watching us I've talked to seeing in and I'm not
[1:26:20.540 --> 1:26:24.300]  tooting my horn it's actually kind of a scary responsibility but yes their eyes
[1:26:24.300 --> 1:26:28.380]  are all on what we're doing and we should ask why is that because we're on
[1:26:28.380 --> 1:26:32.060]  target well that's the thing we're completely on target I'm trying to get
[1:26:32.060 --> 1:26:35.580]  power to all of your listeners in the sense that this is the time in history
[1:26:35.580 --> 1:26:39.180]  or we're at the front of the movement and if they're gonna pay a guy like I
[1:26:39.180 --> 1:26:43.540]  mean I'm tooting your horn because it is Rupert Murdoch government TV paying him
[1:26:43.540 --> 1:26:47.420]  to spin his own version of the truth and spew it at the sheep in order for the
[1:26:47.420 --> 1:26:51.660]  networks to seem empathetic enough so that people will keep tuning in well
[1:26:51.660 --> 1:26:56.260]  sir I know this happened I've been approached by probably ten different
[1:26:56.260 --> 1:27:00.340]  TV networks and they'll have vice presidents heads of programming who
[1:27:00.340 --> 1:27:05.260]  want to put it on they know that's where the audience is and then people in the
[1:27:05.260 --> 1:27:09.940]  ownership level even above management will say no well let me bring it to a
[1:27:09.940 --> 1:27:14.260]  crux for you because this is what I think it is if Fox has for years been
[1:27:14.260 --> 1:27:19.620]  following orders and beating the drums of war for a conflict with Iran and now
[1:27:19.620 --> 1:27:23.860]  with the assaults by Israel looks like that may be on the horizon so if they
[1:27:23.860 --> 1:27:28.980]  now have faker puppet news frontman like back painting these you know crazy real
[1:27:28.980 --> 1:27:34.020]  scenarios on Fox like the bubble effect alongside get to the retired CIA and
[1:27:34.020 --> 1:27:39.020]  military paid TV punnets is that not an imminent sign of time to come in the
[1:27:39.020 --> 1:27:42.700]  very very near future yes speak of everything we don't stand against this
[1:27:42.700 --> 1:27:46.900]  tyranny right now you know they're showing us what they're gonna do well
[1:27:46.900 --> 1:27:50.380]  that's what Michael Savage does he says I'm fighting the new world order and the
[1:27:50.380 --> 1:27:54.780]  new world order is Iran and Iraq and they really do have WMD's and now they're
[1:27:54.780 --> 1:27:59.260]  saying Iran has WMD's and I'm no fan of a lot of stuff Iran does but the point is
[1:27:59.260 --> 1:28:04.340]  the IEA is there this is non weapons grade what they're making and Israel
[1:28:04.340 --> 1:28:08.420]  admitted in in Israeli papers last week we read we read it on air out of the
[1:28:08.420 --> 1:28:11.660]  papers that they're staging assassinations and bombings to try to
[1:28:11.660 --> 1:28:17.380]  destabilize Iran that's an act of war and understand any any nations that
[1:28:17.380 --> 1:28:21.140]  aren't along with their order that have resources and people that are in their
[1:28:21.140 --> 1:28:27.700]  way they're gonna move on yeah that's it and it you know it's scary folks and by
[1:28:27.700 --> 1:28:32.340]  scary I mean the responsibility to I mean I've rationalized I've told myself
[1:28:32.340 --> 1:28:36.260]  I'm not that big I've told myself this show isn't that big you know I think of
[1:28:36.260 --> 1:28:41.020]  the planet as tiny as life short I'm not on a power trip it's the opposite and I
[1:28:41.020 --> 1:28:44.780]  try to minimize it being about Alex Jones in this show and about being you
[1:28:44.780 --> 1:28:48.060]  the listeners because that is what the power is but more and more I mean the
[1:28:48.060 --> 1:28:51.980]  executives that call me and the people I talked to and the things I've heard and
[1:28:51.980 --> 1:28:56.020]  seen you know they're trying to scramble our brains by putting a guy like
[1:28:56.020 --> 1:29:00.620]  Lenbeck in our face and making us think of course not your listeners that he's
[1:29:00.620 --> 1:29:04.740]  talking anything near the truth when it's all talking points that they want us
[1:29:04.740 --> 1:29:08.860]  to believe certain aspects of their compartmentalized issues that they'll
[1:29:08.860 --> 1:29:14.660]  feed us if it's people need to really stand up against and make a big about it
[1:29:14.660 --> 1:29:18.300]  I'll say this for a month I hear you I appreciate your call you know I've been
[1:29:18.300 --> 1:29:24.100]  watching a lot more television lately to analyze things and I it's clear the
[1:29:24.100 --> 1:29:28.860]  door as Webster Tarpley said the false flag stage terror is open they need that
[1:29:28.860 --> 1:29:32.300]  because their agenda is already stalling they may not have staged more
[1:29:32.300 --> 1:29:34.900]  terror and they could get their agenda through without doing it and just
[1:29:34.900 --> 1:29:39.660]  financial terrorism you'll give us all the power of the banks will close but I
[1:29:39.660 --> 1:29:42.720]  do think they're gonna stage a big terror attack and it does look like
[1:29:42.720 --> 1:29:46.780]  Benjamin Netanyahu is planning to attack Iran and just God help us because
[1:29:46.780 --> 1:29:50.420]  this is gonna hurt everybody and I ran in Israel in the United States this is
[1:29:50.420 --> 1:29:56.780]  good for nobody we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the

[1:35:27.820 --> 1:35:37.820]  for the obama deception

[1:35:49.420 --> 1:35:54.860]  contrary to the rumors that you've heard i was not born in a manger
[1:35:54.860 --> 1:36:02.940]  i was actually born on krypton and sent here to save the planet earth
[1:36:04.220 --> 1:36:08.220]  we cannot continue to rely only on our military
[1:36:08.220 --> 1:36:13.020]  in order to achieve the national security objectives that we've set
[1:36:13.020 --> 1:36:16.620]  everybody somewhere between the ages of 18 25 will serve three months of basic
[1:36:16.620 --> 1:36:19.900]  training we've got to have a civilian national security force
[1:36:19.900 --> 1:36:25.900]  that's just as powerful just as strong yes we can
[1:36:25.900 --> 1:36:28.780]  obama's healthcare plan with the cool coverage of all the situation medical
[1:36:28.780 --> 1:36:32.780]  services yes we care obama is a cruel hoax
[1:36:32.780 --> 1:36:36.460]  he works for wall street he's an agent of finance capital
[1:36:36.460 --> 1:36:40.380]  where did you come up with the number 700 billion dollars here's the treasury
[1:36:40.380 --> 1:36:43.420]  spokeswoman's quote it's not based on any particular
[1:36:43.420 --> 1:36:46.700]  data point we just really wanted to come up with a really big number
[1:36:46.700 --> 1:36:50.780]  to democrats and republicans who've opposed this plan
[1:36:50.780 --> 1:36:55.420]  i say step up to the plate a few members were even told
[1:36:55.420 --> 1:36:59.420]  that there would be martial law in america if we voted no
[1:36:59.420 --> 1:37:03.340]  secretary hinry paulson is no george washington
[1:37:03.340 --> 1:37:11.580]  i don't think anyone questions mr kashkari that you're working hard
[1:37:11.580 --> 1:37:16.700]  our question is who you're working for
[1:37:18.220 --> 1:37:22.140]  obama pledged that he would resume the security and prosperity partnership
[1:37:22.140 --> 1:37:26.060]  talks between mexico and canada that the president bush initiated
[1:37:26.060 --> 1:37:29.420]  the old boss is starting to look a lot like the new boss robert gates is going
[1:37:29.420 --> 1:37:33.340]  to remain on the job as defense secretary for at least a year
[1:37:33.340 --> 1:37:38.140]  plenty of sources knew about this meeting uh told us and others that it was at
[1:37:38.140 --> 1:37:43.100]  hillary clinton's house but clearly it wasn't
[1:37:43.100 --> 1:37:46.620]  we've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of uh
[1:37:46.620 --> 1:37:49.420]  world order that i think all of us would like to see
[1:37:49.420 --> 1:37:53.100]  we see you causing a depression so you can blow out the economy

[1:39:26.460 --> 1:39:30.380]  that are very important actually parts of the film which will be shorter so it's
[1:39:30.380 --> 1:39:35.340]  heavily produced good extras and you can get them as low as 995 when you
[1:39:35.340 --> 1:39:38.380]  were even lower than that when you ordered the film in bulk
[1:39:38.380 --> 1:39:41.900]  at the obama deception dot net or info wars dot com

[1:39:54.940 --> 1:39:57.180]  for everything you do for a long time supporter
[1:39:57.180 --> 1:40:01.180]  and i'd like to give a quick shout out to my affiliates at the coding university
[1:40:01.180 --> 1:40:05.660]  k o d e i n e university dot blog spot dot com
[1:40:05.660 --> 1:40:09.180]  um just my own little personal thing to try and help the movement good
[1:40:09.180 --> 1:40:12.460]  um but i wanted to call today and talk to you about the nationalization of
[1:40:12.460 --> 1:40:14.620]  banks that i've been hearing about all over cnn
[1:40:14.620 --> 1:40:18.220]  yeah it's not really national it's not really nationalization go ahead
[1:40:18.220 --> 1:40:21.340]  oh well i'm not certain specifically that's why i was actually open to get
[1:40:21.340 --> 1:40:25.340]  some more input from you um but what i was wondering is is usually when i
[1:40:25.340 --> 1:40:27.420]  hear the word nationalization i'm thinking of
[1:40:27.420 --> 1:40:30.940]  governments taking over private industries and that's usually the issue
[1:40:30.940 --> 1:40:33.580]  but with this it almost seems like they're gonna try and use it as a
[1:40:33.580 --> 1:40:37.580]  reverse usurp of the government where the banking cartels will actually
[1:40:37.580 --> 1:40:41.980]  basically inject themselves into our government
[1:40:41.980 --> 1:40:45.020]  and i was just wondering what you what your thoughts on that work
[1:40:45.020 --> 1:40:48.620]  well i'm going to play a clip coming up in the next segment
[1:40:48.620 --> 1:40:51.980]  i'm glad you reminded me where the federal reserve
[1:40:51.980 --> 1:40:56.780]  security force which are private police officers but accredited police officers
[1:40:56.780 --> 1:41:01.260]  mercenaries the lady walks over to a guy on the sidewalk not even on their
[1:41:01.260 --> 1:41:05.020]  property and i stood right there in dc and shot footage myself
[1:41:05.020 --> 1:41:08.540]  and she walks over but that was on a weekend so they didn't come out
[1:41:08.540 --> 1:41:14.460]  and they tell a large news outlet that uh that does a lot of work online
[1:41:14.460 --> 1:41:18.140]  turn your camera off and the guy says well i'm allowed to of course he doesn't
[1:41:18.140 --> 1:41:22.060]  ask what the law is and erin russo's freedom to fascism the same goons come
[1:41:22.060 --> 1:41:25.820]  over and say you can't videotape and everywhere i went in dc
[1:41:25.820 --> 1:41:29.580]  everywhere i went uh you would try to film the white house they come over and
[1:41:29.580 --> 1:41:32.300]  say you can't film the white house and i would be on the sidewalk
[1:41:32.300 --> 1:41:35.740]  and i'd say excuse me this is america and they'd say you can't and i would go to
[1:41:35.740 --> 1:41:38.620]  the washington monument and they'd say you can't film it and i'd say yes i can
[1:41:38.620 --> 1:41:42.140]  first amendment they go you got to get a permit and i said you know what
[1:41:42.140 --> 1:41:45.340]  we checked because we're here with a independent film channel crew
[1:41:45.340 --> 1:41:48.300]  they checked and because they want to follow the rules
[1:41:48.300 --> 1:41:51.820]  permits are not issued unless you're inside buildings and i said
[1:41:51.820 --> 1:41:54.140]  and they would start getting threatening we even have footage of this
[1:41:54.140 --> 1:41:55.740]  ought to put it out on the web and i'd say
[1:41:55.740 --> 1:42:01.020]  you know what uh if you falsely arrest me i'm going to be forced to sue you
[1:42:01.020 --> 1:42:04.380]  you know this is america you got cameras surveilling us everywhere
[1:42:04.380 --> 1:42:06.700]  and it didn't matter if i was out on the street
[1:42:06.700 --> 1:42:09.740]  filming the supreme court it didn't matter if i was out on the street
[1:42:09.740 --> 1:42:13.420]  uh filming uh the library of congress it didn't matter
[1:42:13.420 --> 1:42:16.460]  what building i was filming it didn't matter if we were at the
[1:42:16.460 --> 1:42:21.340]  uh arlington cemetery on the side of the road they'd come over and say stop
[1:42:21.340 --> 1:42:25.660]  and these are thugs this is a sick joke and
[1:42:25.660 --> 1:42:28.380]  i mean this is worse than mexico city they don't stop you from filming in
[1:42:28.380 --> 1:42:32.220]  mexico city there is no law and here you have this private
[1:42:32.220 --> 1:42:35.900]  federal reserve cop saying we're a federal reserve we're the federal
[1:42:35.900 --> 1:42:39.180]  government you can't film the federal government it's the law
[1:42:39.180 --> 1:42:43.500]  there is no law and that's the whole thing to become the federal government
[1:42:43.500 --> 1:42:46.860]  i thought they were a private insurance company or is that well well they
[1:42:46.860 --> 1:42:51.180]  yes they have never been part of the federal government since they took
[1:42:51.180 --> 1:42:54.380]  over in 1913 and they ordered the treasury around
[1:42:54.380 --> 1:42:59.100]  but in the banker bailout bill they were given above government power
[1:42:59.100 --> 1:43:02.380]  above congress no agency no police group can even
[1:43:02.380 --> 1:43:05.340]  start an investigation of them that's the subsection
[1:43:05.340 --> 1:43:07.980]  and so when you hear privatization when you hear
[1:43:07.980 --> 1:43:12.060]  us taxpayer money is going to buy 40 positions
[1:43:12.060 --> 1:43:16.860]  uh in city bank and in other megabanks and then there's no oversight
[1:43:16.860 --> 1:43:21.100]  that just means they're giving them your money forget the banks just issuing
[1:43:21.100 --> 1:43:25.900]  currency and then getting uh interest on it they are now saying
[1:43:25.900 --> 1:43:32.380]  that they will fully rule us and so it's not privatization it is a hijacking
[1:43:32.380 --> 1:43:37.900]  it is a pirate gang it is a takeover it is color of law
[1:43:37.900 --> 1:43:42.300]  it is openly the district of columbia private corporation
[1:43:42.300 --> 1:43:47.180]  set up after the civil war fully being taken over in a corporate
[1:43:47.180 --> 1:43:52.380]  takeover of what's left of the government and so
[1:43:52.380 --> 1:43:55.340]  the federal government's taken over by private banks that's why they're
[1:43:55.340 --> 1:43:58.140]  federalizing the states because it's not even federalization
[1:43:58.140 --> 1:44:03.500]  that's private mercenary takeover of everything and so yes this is not a
[1:44:03.500 --> 1:44:07.580]  privatization this is the federal reserve openly becoming government
[1:44:07.580 --> 1:44:10.940]  because it is going to be the regional governorship
[1:44:10.940 --> 1:44:14.860]  of the world government according to every major news report
[1:44:14.860 --> 1:44:19.500]  again wall street journal financial times of london ap agency french press
[1:44:19.500 --> 1:44:23.100]  uh roiders time magazine wall street wall it's all out there i've been
[1:44:23.100 --> 1:44:27.100]  reading them on air a quote bank of the world that will control every
[1:44:27.100 --> 1:44:30.860]  government of the world control the currencies control uh the interest
[1:44:30.860 --> 1:44:33.580]  rates selectively they'll play that off against nations
[1:44:33.580 --> 1:44:36.460]  to further consolidate power and vertically integrate
[1:44:36.460 --> 1:44:39.820]  and and the united states will be ruled through the regional governorship of the
[1:44:39.820 --> 1:44:45.180]  federal reserve and so this is absolute total mass crime
[1:44:45.180 --> 1:44:49.100]  takeover in front of everyone with the nice pretty pitchman
[1:44:49.100 --> 1:44:53.100]  barack obama it's pitching these serpents already been taken place they're just
[1:44:53.100 --> 1:44:55.420]  actually flexing the muscle now is what you're saying
[1:44:55.420 --> 1:44:58.460]  well they're they're going completely public with it
[1:44:58.460 --> 1:45:02.060]  right they've already done they have the control it's just now they're
[1:45:02.060 --> 1:45:05.820]  they're letting everybody know hey yes but now that's why they've had former
[1:45:05.820 --> 1:45:08.460]  and current fed governors who've even been cut out of the loop at the regional
[1:45:08.460 --> 1:45:12.780]  banks telling bloomberg and ap quote war powers have been declared
[1:45:12.780 --> 1:45:18.060]  we're not even part of it now this is full total foreign domination just like
[1:45:18.060 --> 1:45:20.860]  the banks dominate third world countries this is full
[1:45:20.860 --> 1:45:24.380]  complete occupation by a paramilitary force
[1:45:24.380 --> 1:45:30.300]  openly owned by private banks grief just a lot so i know you're busy man so i'm

[1:46:49.740 --> 1:46:53.180]  and he had a radio show called hour of the time
[1:46:53.180 --> 1:46:56.220]  and he dealt with a lot of the patriot issues that you do with but he also dealt
[1:46:56.220 --> 1:47:00.860]  with like ufo type stuff and um i was curious uh kind of
[1:47:00.860 --> 1:47:03.820]  what your thoughts were on him and also i wanted to know
[1:47:03.820 --> 1:47:09.980]  what role if any should ufo's uh play in the in the patriot movement

[1:47:13.500 --> 1:47:17.500]  appreciate the call let me briefly try to answer that
[1:47:17.500 --> 1:47:21.980]  all i deal with is what i can prove and from the classified and leak government
[1:47:21.980 --> 1:47:26.140]  documents and talking to dr bob bowman the former head of star wars
[1:47:26.140 --> 1:47:29.420]  also another incarnation colonel bob bowman
[1:47:29.420 --> 1:47:34.060]  he can only tell me what had been leaked by accident
[1:47:34.060 --> 1:47:37.180]  and i went and checked what he told me back during the 9-11 symposium in la
[1:47:37.180 --> 1:47:40.460]  when we had a lunch privately for an hour because i was really prying him for
[1:47:40.460 --> 1:47:43.260]  you know anything you could tell me that didn't violate national security
[1:47:43.260 --> 1:47:47.420]  letters he'd sign and he told me what i already knew
[1:47:47.420 --> 1:47:54.620]  um by the late 70s they had over a hundred drone robot
[1:47:54.620 --> 1:47:59.100]  aircraft uh space planes
[1:47:59.100 --> 1:48:02.540]  i mean it you know all the technologies around having a human survive in these
[1:48:02.540 --> 1:48:04.620]  well it's very easy to launch them without that
[1:48:04.620 --> 1:48:08.700]  that have du solid round meteor gun weapons
[1:48:08.700 --> 1:48:12.380]  they they they fire the hundred pounder larger
[1:48:12.380 --> 1:48:16.140]  and they carry a lot of these uh depleted uranium with an incredible mass
[1:48:16.140 --> 1:48:20.220]  it goes through the gravity well and accelerates over 30 000 miles an hour
[1:48:20.220 --> 1:48:24.540]  and is the equivalent of a medium-sized nuclear weapon
[1:48:24.540 --> 1:48:28.380]  it will destroy underground bases a mile under and you can't build bases a
[1:48:28.380 --> 1:48:31.260]  mile under anyways because you get there's too much pressure
[1:48:31.260 --> 1:48:35.740]  you know the heat goes up over 130 degrees so the deepest bases
[1:48:35.740 --> 1:48:38.860]  you know can only be about a half mile down generally they have some supposedly
[1:48:38.860 --> 1:48:41.820]  deeper that are especially air conditioned but that's a side issue
[1:48:41.820 --> 1:48:44.780]  and this is a decapitation weapon to be able to take over the whole planet
[1:48:44.780 --> 1:48:47.740]  basically instantly where they can just kill the leadership of the world if they
[1:48:47.740 --> 1:48:51.420]  want in a matter of minutes in the 70s they had the
[1:48:51.420 --> 1:48:55.820]  the decapitation drones orbiting the planet and they've got big platforms
[1:48:55.820 --> 1:48:59.900]  most of space programs secret and they've got this up there so i talk
[1:48:59.900 --> 1:49:04.780]  about things like that uh i i i'm not the grandpa i don't decide what
[1:49:04.780 --> 1:49:08.220]  has a place i don't decide what can be discussed i don't tell
[1:49:08.220 --> 1:49:11.420]  people what they should talk about i don't get into little green men and all
[1:49:11.420 --> 1:49:14.620]  the rest of this i'm not saying some of that isn't
[1:49:14.620 --> 1:49:17.820]  going on i don't know i can't get folks who are building
[1:49:17.820 --> 1:49:21.900]  fema camps and gun confiscation drills when it's in the mainstream news
[1:49:21.900 --> 1:49:26.300]  on the subject of bill cooper i woke up
[1:49:26.300 --> 1:49:29.980]  you know from more of the john burt society type angle and reading history
[1:49:29.980 --> 1:49:34.140]  books and i literally hadn't read Behold a
[1:49:34.140 --> 1:49:37.820]  pale horse to like 96 97 and i couldn't get through it because it was all about
[1:49:37.820 --> 1:49:42.060]  submarine flying saucers and you know all this stuff and i just
[1:49:42.060 --> 1:49:46.220]  thought that was cookie i was more like a mainline ron paul type guy
[1:49:46.220 --> 1:49:49.660]  and then mr cooper was in trouble with the iris he put out a call for help i
[1:49:49.660 --> 1:49:53.420]  tried to get him help uh he was very very argumentative and
[1:49:53.420 --> 1:49:56.780]  angry when i even had him on the phone as he was to everybody else
[1:49:56.780 --> 1:50:00.700]  and then he kept using profanity i was having to delay him out on the radio
[1:50:00.700 --> 1:50:04.220]  and then i let him go early on the show people go we did we heard that show we
[1:50:04.220 --> 1:50:06.780]  don't hear the cussing because i delayed it out folks
[1:50:06.780 --> 1:50:11.100]  um the station had a great delay 15 second
[1:50:11.100 --> 1:50:15.180]  and you know then i then the network put me on at night and he freaked out and
[1:50:15.180 --> 1:50:18.620]  thought that i was going up against him he started saying that i wore
[1:50:18.620 --> 1:50:24.780]  this is a quote um ruby nipple rings i mean i'm not
[1:50:24.780 --> 1:50:29.260]  kidding if the lies were just so vicious and so horrible and then even when
[1:50:29.260 --> 1:50:33.180]  they killed him i you know i said it was terrible and looked like a setup and
[1:50:33.180 --> 1:50:35.980]  you know and i've tried to say nice things about even though he did all those
[1:50:35.980 --> 1:50:40.780]  horrible things to me and the people demand that i come into it and you know
[1:50:40.780 --> 1:50:44.140]  get into it and they're the ones that won't let the dead raster
[1:50:44.140 --> 1:50:47.340]  you know uses material for whatever they want so i'm not going to get into a
[1:50:47.340 --> 1:50:49.660]  fight or anything with with with bill cooper
[1:50:49.660 --> 1:50:53.980]  um i mean you know anybody that knew him just knew he was
[1:50:53.980 --> 1:50:58.220]  he was just out of his mind i mean screaming cussing at people
[1:50:58.220 --> 1:51:01.180]  uh just constantly
[1:51:01.900 --> 1:51:05.980]  do you have trouble sleeping due to sensations in your legs

[1:54:23.500 --> 1:54:27.260]  it's about getting people to wake up and say no to the globalist
[1:54:27.260 --> 1:54:31.980]  i mean i saw five news articles this morning
[1:54:31.980 --> 1:54:36.380]  about more poison food from china more poison food in the u.s

[1:54:46.540 --> 1:54:51.100]  there's no reason that should be there it's not in the manufacturing process
[1:54:51.100 --> 1:54:53.980]  i mean we're dying this is eugenics this is being done by
[1:54:53.980 --> 1:54:57.500]  on purpose i got more mainstream articles yesterday where they admit that
[1:54:57.500 --> 1:55:01.340]  millions and millions of ampoules of factor eight were shipped out
[1:55:01.340 --> 1:55:05.180]  to hemophiliacs and others that had hiv and hepatitis and every shot that
[1:55:05.180 --> 1:55:09.020]  killed them deader than a hammer and others are still dying
[1:55:09.020 --> 1:55:13.260]  i mean this is insane and and and meanwhile people are all what about
[1:55:13.260 --> 1:55:16.780]  this patriot what about that patriot well i like this host i like that us

[1:55:20.620 --> 1:55:23.740]  depression troops are standing by mexico
[1:55:23.740 --> 1:55:29.020]  is collapsing we got to be adults here folks
[1:55:29.020 --> 1:55:31.580]  i've tried to take the high road on so many issues
[1:55:31.580 --> 1:55:34.940]  and as we get bigger and bigger and reach more people you know more and more
[1:55:34.940 --> 1:55:38.860]  folks just get jealous who are kind of in the old guard movement and they need
[1:55:38.860 --> 1:55:42.220]  to stop that we need to pull together against the globalist
[1:55:42.220 --> 1:55:45.660]  we don't have time to screw around speaking of tyranny here's the audio
[1:55:45.660 --> 1:55:48.540]  from the video that's up on prisonplanet.com
[1:55:48.540 --> 1:55:51.660]  of the fellow reserve telling a great news outlet i've seen the work they've
[1:55:51.660 --> 1:55:57.340]  done turn your camera off all color of law all fraud just completely made up
[1:55:57.340 --> 1:56:01.660]  uh just just just telling the slave he can't stay on the sidewalk and videotape

[1:56:18.860 --> 1:56:22.940]  when you take pictures or videotape just have to call public affairs
[1:56:22.940 --> 1:56:26.300]  they set it up you have a meeting they tell you what time to come out and take
[1:56:26.300 --> 1:56:29.980]  pictures you take pictures all day long so i can't stand on the public sidewalk
[1:56:29.980 --> 1:56:32.700]  you can go across the street if you like but they still won't come over and ask
[1:56:32.700 --> 1:56:35.100]  you questions you can stay too long

[2:00:49.740 --> 2:00:53.980]  dr evan veyara constitutional law scholar and attorney will be joining us
[2:00:53.980 --> 2:00:57.580]  talk about the states rights movement exploding we now have alabama and several
[2:00:57.580 --> 2:01:00.940]  other states moving to say any new federal gun laws are unconstitutional
[2:01:00.940 --> 2:01:06.380]  we're not following them no gun confiscation montana mississippi louisiana uh texas
[2:01:07.180 --> 2:01:10.460]  we've got a state senator from texas making national headlines about
[2:01:10.460 --> 2:01:13.740]  putting state forces on the border as mexico collapses
[2:01:13.740 --> 2:01:18.380]  that's coming up in the next hour a little bit later i'm going to play this clip that's
[2:01:18.380 --> 2:01:27.740]  up on prisonplanet.com and that clip deals with the fact that the federal reserve
[2:01:28.540 --> 2:01:34.620]  minions walk over to a camera person and tell them that they aren't allowed
[2:01:35.820 --> 2:01:42.380]  to videotape a local camera crew in fact we we have that clip now let's go ahead and
[2:01:42.380 --> 2:01:49.340]  cut over here to this shot and then we're going to go ahead and go to this video
[2:01:49.340 --> 2:01:50.780]  for folks so here it is
[2:01:54.940 --> 2:02:00.700]  right here live on prisonplanet.tv
[2:02:00.700 --> 2:02:08.380]  what's up
[2:02:11.100 --> 2:02:14.300]  no i'm just getting some serious shots no you need to go through public affairs
[2:02:14.300 --> 2:02:18.140]  but use your videotape or take pictures of any federal building
[2:02:19.340 --> 2:02:23.500]  because i wish it was the academy of sciences i don't care cap it's just got a reserve
[2:02:24.060 --> 2:02:29.260]  when you take pictures or videotape just have to call public affairs they set it up you have a
[2:02:29.260 --> 2:02:32.940]  meeting they tell you what time to come out and take pictures you take pictures all day long
[2:02:33.580 --> 2:02:36.940]  so i can't stand on the public sidewalk you can go across the street if you like but they
[2:02:36.940 --> 2:02:42.300]  still won't come over and ask you questions you can stay too long um so where am i allowed to shoot
[2:02:42.300 --> 2:02:48.220]  from stop stop stop stop stop i mean this is so incredible in america to see this
[2:02:49.580 --> 2:02:52.780]  you can even go across the street but we'll still come over there there's no law
[2:02:53.500 --> 2:02:57.500]  as she says we met you know we may snatch your camera like a third world country
[2:02:57.500 --> 2:03:02.220]  snatch you and i had this happen to me all over dc and i'd say look there's no law and you know it
[2:03:03.420 --> 2:03:08.780]  and the larger issue of what they do is
[2:03:11.420 --> 2:03:15.500]  tell you then to come sign up with them and then they just don't answer your calls or don't return
[2:03:15.500 --> 2:03:19.820]  calls because cthink a film production company for independent film channel was following us around
[2:03:19.820 --> 2:03:24.620]  when we were in dc last year and they had tried they go you know they had tried to get permits
[2:03:24.620 --> 2:03:29.100]  there's no permits issued permits are only for inside the buildings because it's the first
[2:03:29.100 --> 2:03:34.300]  of them an issue it's been litigated but they don't care they still come out and they still
[2:03:34.300 --> 2:03:41.420]  enforce this on everyone and you've got to ask yourselves why because they're setting the precedent
[2:03:41.420 --> 2:03:46.780]  this is just like a third world country or soviet russia or nazi germany and the public has been
[2:03:46.780 --> 2:03:55.660]  trained like cowards just do what they say let's go ahead and go back to the club the picture
[2:03:55.660 --> 2:03:59.020]  they're not going to snatch your camera but if you come up with something like that they
[2:03:59.020 --> 2:04:01.420]  want to approach you and they're going to ask you what you're doing they're going to ask you for
[2:04:01.420 --> 2:04:07.900]  id all that good stuff okay uh what if i was wearing like a press badge now if you did that
[2:04:07.900 --> 2:04:11.420]  they're going to ask you who's your contact person because then you should have contacted public
[2:04:11.420 --> 2:04:17.420]  affairs um the fed public affairs are just like public affairs for the federal reserve so for every
[2:04:17.420 --> 2:04:21.340]  building i need to contact that public affairs person yes sir even just to shoot for the public
[2:04:21.340 --> 2:04:27.740]  sidewalk yes sir i did not know that yes sir uh is that new no it's always been like that because
[2:04:27.740 --> 2:04:31.980]  i now there's tours they come through here snap a picture and keep on going yeah and you do about
[2:04:31.980 --> 2:04:36.060]  no as long as they take a picture and keep on going but when you come up with a video camera
[2:04:36.060 --> 2:04:40.620]  like that that's when we come out and get you because i've shot like tons of going so you're
[2:04:40.620 --> 2:04:43.420]  the first person to ever approach me they probably don't have paid attention to you
[2:04:45.900 --> 2:04:51.980]  everyone viara coming up and get his uh take on it but but this is us being slaves she's talking

[2:08:29.660 --> 2:08:34.540]  got him here to cover a host of issues today for the next uh fifty one minutes that we have left
[2:08:34.540 --> 2:08:42.700]  in this hour but serve just for those who have just joined us for the first time or may not know
[2:08:42.700 --> 2:08:47.020]  who you are briefly for listeners what's most important for folks to know about yourself
[2:08:49.180 --> 2:08:54.620]  well that i have been studying problems of constitutional law for more than 30 years now
[2:08:55.340 --> 2:09:00.860]  focusing to a very large degree on monetary matters and then let me say in the last uh
[2:09:00.860 --> 2:09:08.860]  uh oh probably 10 years total uh looking into questions of the constitutional militia and then
[2:09:08.860 --> 2:09:14.780]  more specifically after 9 11 uh the whole area was called homeland security and then the intersection
[2:09:15.580 --> 2:09:21.100]  of those two matters which when you study it alex it really tends to bring in or sweep in
[2:09:21.100 --> 2:09:24.940]  all of the basic principles of the constitution and the declaration of independence they're
[2:09:24.940 --> 2:09:30.940]  they're intimately tied in to those areas because i like to tell people you look at money and the
[2:09:30.940 --> 2:09:35.740]  militia or that whole homeland security problem one of the two fundamental powers of government
[2:09:35.740 --> 2:09:41.580]  that you're talking about the power of the purse and the power of the sword which anyone who has
[2:09:41.580 --> 2:09:46.140]  well versed in political philosophy realizes historically have always been considered to be
[2:09:46.140 --> 2:09:52.140]  the premier powers of government of any kind of government well you are accredited as being in
[2:09:52.140 --> 2:09:55.900]  the you know top 10 constitutional law scholars out there so you can speak to all these issues i
[2:09:55.900 --> 2:10:00.940]  want to get into the now upwards of 30 with alabama declaring a pro-second amendment
[2:10:02.380 --> 2:10:06.780]  bill that's been introduced states are passing these bills saying no to the feds bringing up the
[2:10:06.780 --> 2:10:11.980]  martial law bringing up the gun confiscation plans bringing up the presidential decision
[2:10:11.980 --> 2:10:17.580]  directives very exciting to see the state reps and state senators informed on what's going on we
[2:10:17.580 --> 2:10:22.940]  have one joining us next hour but before we do that before you join this i played a clip of a
[2:10:23.980 --> 2:10:29.420]  online news agency videotaping from the sidewalk to federal reserve in dc which i've done myself
[2:10:29.420 --> 2:10:37.020]  the private federal reserve and the federal reserve minion who's not a federal police officer
[2:10:37.020 --> 2:10:41.100]  comes over and says you can't film across the street you know we'll we'll come harass you there
[2:10:41.100 --> 2:10:45.260]  you can't film here you've got to get permission from us well i just so happen to know that a film
[2:10:45.260 --> 2:10:48.700]  crew tried to get permission to film out front the fellow reserve when they told him that from
[2:10:48.700 --> 2:10:53.900]  the independent film channel and they were told no so uh they're turning a right into a privilege
[2:10:54.460 --> 2:11:00.300]  i want to play you a clip of this uh this audio and then get your response to what you hear this
[2:11:00.300 --> 2:11:07.980]  is during uh the confrontation where he's standing at the fence and she's behind it uh you know telling
[2:11:07.980 --> 2:11:14.140]  him that uh he can't be there filming uh here's a little bit of that they're not going to snap
[2:11:14.140 --> 2:11:18.060]  your camera but if you come up with something like that they're going to approach you they're
[2:11:18.060 --> 2:11:21.100]  going to ask you what you're doing they're going to ask you for id all that good stuff
[2:11:22.220 --> 2:11:27.020]  okay uh what if i was wearing like a press badge now if you did that they're going to ask you
[2:11:27.020 --> 2:11:31.820]  who's your contact person because then you should have contacted public affairs um the fed public
[2:11:31.820 --> 2:11:36.220]  affairs are just like public affairs for the federal reserve so for every building i need to
[2:11:36.220 --> 2:11:40.300]  contact that public affairs person yes sir even just to shoot for the public sidewalk yes sir
[2:11:40.300 --> 2:11:46.540]  oh i did not know that yes sir uh is that new no it's always been like that because i now there's
[2:11:46.540 --> 2:11:51.100]  tours that come through here snap a picture and keep on going yeah and usually about no as long as
[2:11:51.100 --> 2:11:55.340]  they take a picture and keep on going but when you come up with a video camera like that that's when
[2:11:55.340 --> 2:11:59.900]  we come out and get you because i've shot like tons of going so you're the first person to ever
[2:11:59.900 --> 2:12:06.460]  approach me they probably never pay attention to you but this is the federal reserve okay is that
[2:12:06.460 --> 2:12:11.260]  bigger what do you mean what do you mean you don't know what the federal reserve is this is the
[2:12:11.260 --> 2:12:15.340]  federal i mean okay okay who do you work for an american news project what i mean is like i've
[2:12:15.340 --> 2:12:21.020]  shot the white house and okay capital building and they never approached you no i can't even see
[2:12:21.020 --> 2:12:24.700]  that the treasury building you know standing there where all the public walks just standing right
[2:12:24.700 --> 2:12:28.780]  there on the sidewalk pictures you know just getting some b-roll digs here i've never had anybody
[2:12:28.780 --> 2:12:33.260]  but now what if we used to take pictures of this building or any kind of videotape we have to go to
[2:12:33.260 --> 2:12:43.820]  public affairs okay all right uh so i can't just shoot your shots here no sir all right um and what
[2:12:43.820 --> 2:12:47.580]  about the shots that i've already shot can i use those i i have nothing to do with you don't shot
[2:12:47.580 --> 2:12:55.500]  already right okay okay um is there like up security here the federal reserve is it up no it's
[2:12:55.500 --> 2:13:01.340]  always been like this yeah uh stop right there this is classic it's not just feds and federal
[2:13:01.340 --> 2:13:06.140]  security guards at the supreme court and everywhere else i've been coming across the street or this or
[2:13:06.140 --> 2:13:10.460]  the white house or the washington monument saying you can't film it you can't film it and i said go
[2:13:10.460 --> 2:13:14.300]  ahead and arrest me you know it's color of law and a fraud and i'm an apsuya and they back off
[2:13:14.300 --> 2:13:20.300]  that they know they're making this up they've been told to go out and and and create this legalese
[2:13:20.300 --> 2:13:24.140]  and try to create some type of common law precedence to just have us as slaves
[2:13:24.780 --> 2:13:28.620]  accept it but with this it's even sweeter because she's saying in the in the earlier part of the
[2:13:28.620 --> 2:13:33.340]  clip this is a federal reserve federal building but it's not a federal reserve it's not a federal
[2:13:33.340 --> 2:13:38.780]  building and there she is behind her little fence telling him that even if you go across the
[2:13:38.780 --> 2:13:43.340]  street we're going to come over and might snatch your camera uh dr ebbon veera as a constitutional
[2:13:43.340 --> 2:13:48.300]  attorney and law scholar who's again won before the supreme court uh what is this we're witnessing
[2:13:50.140 --> 2:13:54.460]  well i'm not exactly sure what the motivation is although i think it's probably a sinister one
[2:13:54.460 --> 2:14:01.260]  uh the it's also i've seen instances where this type of argument has been made about taking photographs
[2:14:01.260 --> 2:14:08.060]  of police engaged in activities on a public street and arrests and so forth uh primarily
[2:14:08.060 --> 2:14:13.740]  there i suppose they're concerned about being sued for police brutality but nonetheless i cannot
[2:14:13.740 --> 2:14:19.740]  imagine the constitutional justification for saying that someone standing on a public sidewalk
[2:14:19.740 --> 2:14:27.180]  uh cannot take a photograph of any building within washington dc i mean any building what's
[2:14:27.180 --> 2:14:32.700]  funny about this is uh i put out a book several years ago called crash maker it's a semi-fictionalized
[2:14:32.700 --> 2:14:38.540]  novel of a collapse of the federal reserve system and on the cover of that book is a stylized
[2:14:39.900 --> 2:14:44.700]  drawing of the federal reserve the old federal reserve building on constitutional avenue
[2:14:44.700 --> 2:14:50.940]  and that was taken from a photograph or a number of photographs that i took actually on their plaza
[2:14:51.820 --> 2:14:57.340]  set up my tripod and i was just shooting film half of the afternoon to get the light right
[2:14:58.300 --> 2:15:01.980]  and no one showed up at that point that is because this was years ago that was in uh
[2:15:01.980 --> 2:15:07.580]  1998 or 1999 sometimes ago uh maybe even a little bit earlier than that so i mean no one
[2:15:07.580 --> 2:15:11.900]  showed up and said well you can't take photograph the federal reserve building and now this uh
[2:15:11.900 --> 2:15:17.420]  uh woman whatever her capacity is is saying you can't shoot it from a public street well she's
[2:15:17.420 --> 2:15:22.300]  at her capacity as a federal reserve police officer in a literal stormtrooper outfit with a
[2:15:22.300 --> 2:15:27.900]  gold buckle i mean it's the closest uh uniform i've seen people wearing uh that's the closest
[2:15:27.900 --> 2:15:33.180]  to a nazi uniform i've ever seen well then she's some kind of private security officer because
[2:15:33.180 --> 2:15:39.340]  the federal reserve system obviously is not a governmental entity board of governors might be
[2:15:39.340 --> 2:15:44.060]  a governmental uh board but not the rest of the federal reserve system it's all very peculiar
[2:15:44.060 --> 2:15:49.100]  but it's something that Aaron Russo went into this problem many years ago and i wasn't with him
[2:15:49.100 --> 2:15:55.420]  but it was described to me he was down shooting the irs building video camera and they came out
[2:15:55.420 --> 2:15:59.820]  and told him he couldn't do that and i believe he walked across the street uh and he was shooting
[2:15:59.820 --> 2:16:05.500]  from across the street and he had a confrontation some of the uh dc police actually showed up
[2:16:05.500 --> 2:16:11.180]  and confronted him and said this couldn't be done and he said show me the law and backed him off
[2:16:11.180 --> 2:16:15.500]  yeah well that's right but that obviously they have some i mean there may be some legitimate
[2:16:15.500 --> 2:16:20.540]  concern and that lurking in the background that the people who are taking these photographs are
[2:16:20.540 --> 2:16:25.020]  attempting to find some vulnerability in the now it's ridiculous though right there they're
[2:16:25.020 --> 2:16:30.700]  surveilling us thank you but i mean they're surveilling us everywhere with cameras and then
[2:16:30.700 --> 2:16:35.500]  they're they just passed a law in england that that if you've a videotape or photograph police you're
[2:16:35.500 --> 2:16:40.380]  going to be charged with terrorism at the officer's discretion i mean this is like the soviet union
[2:16:40.380 --> 2:16:44.780]  well that's right and i think that this whole business that has a positive and negative sense
[2:16:44.780 --> 2:16:51.020]  they want you to get used to uh their cameras and their constant surveillance and on the other hand
[2:16:51.020 --> 2:16:57.100]  they want you not to be recording what they're doing because that is of course is what turns
[2:16:57.100 --> 2:17:02.460]  up in evidence in civil rights cases and police brutality cases and perhaps criminal cases in
[2:17:02.460 --> 2:17:07.660]  which someone is charged with something and uh the uh videotaping of the event shows that
[2:17:07.660 --> 2:17:11.660]  exactly the opposite happened for them they're definitely scared of cameras and and you know
[2:17:11.660 --> 2:17:16.380]  we saw when they murdered that guy execution style you know in the bay area shooting him in the back
[2:17:16.380 --> 2:17:22.460]  they confiscated two cameras two phone cameras they said that the cameras the government cameras
[2:17:22.460 --> 2:17:29.580]  malfunctioned but then people in a train and down the way did videotape even them taking cameras
[2:17:29.580 --> 2:17:33.740]  and then it came out that they were trying to cover up the murder so uh they're not going to
[2:17:33.740 --> 2:17:39.340]  be able to stop this uh you know i don't know and then that's the only reason for it let's face the
[2:17:39.340 --> 2:17:45.580]  fact the only possible reason leaving aside the you know the the the mystical theory that the
[2:17:45.580 --> 2:17:51.420]  terrorist a terrorist would use some videotape of the irs building to commit an act of terrorism
[2:17:51.420 --> 2:17:55.660]  the only reason for this is to be able to cover up official misconduct
[2:17:57.580 --> 2:18:02.540]  and boss the people around and train us to be slaves well that's the other side watching you
[2:18:02.540 --> 2:18:08.220]  but i mean in terms of photographing them the only reason is to cover up official misconduct
[2:18:08.220 --> 2:18:12.060]  well well well dr ebb and veer let me say this when i was in dc last year for several days
[2:18:12.060 --> 2:18:16.140]  they weren't just bossing me around treating me like crap there would be families with their
[2:18:16.140 --> 2:18:21.500]  camera taking pictures at the lincoln memorial at i mean we have this on tape and they would come over
[2:18:21.500 --> 2:18:27.580]  and talk to them like they were dirt and and literally we'd be telling them what alec telling
[2:18:27.580 --> 2:18:32.780]  them you can't photograph we would be in the grass across the street on the other side from the
[2:18:32.780 --> 2:18:40.460]  white house and we had white house police come over and tell us we can't film and i'd say you
[2:18:40.460 --> 2:18:45.100]  i said this this is the first amendment oh let me have your press pass i go buddy you know it's
[2:18:45.100 --> 2:18:49.580]  the first amendment and i said do what you got to do so then they had secret service follow us
[2:18:49.580 --> 2:18:55.660]  around all day in dc because we dare not get down and just start licking the boots which
[2:18:55.660 --> 2:18:59.340]  tells them to suggest that they had nothing better to do with this secret service why aren't they
[2:18:59.340 --> 2:19:06.460]  out searching for those terrorists working in the back alleys of dc well we know now time to harass
[2:19:06.460 --> 2:19:11.500]  the average person what does that tell you about the war on terror what does that tell you about
[2:19:11.500 --> 2:19:18.140]  their attitude and how bankrupt the government is and how thuggish it is well i think we know
[2:19:18.140 --> 2:19:23.100]  that already but i mean i'm just looking at the excuse that they give us for all this thuggishness
[2:19:23.980 --> 2:19:28.140]  and what are they spending their time doing hope you're talking to harassing tourists at
[2:19:28.140 --> 2:19:33.820]  the lincoln memorial it's unbelievable sir they just boss you'll have like a sidewalk by a park
[2:19:33.820 --> 2:19:38.060]  with a family eating ice cream cones and the police code you can't block the sidewalk move along
[2:19:38.060 --> 2:19:43.820]  move along and the father's like and then they all grovel and the police go and they got private
[2:19:43.820 --> 2:19:50.780]  security guards doing it you couldn't believe it and it was just off the charts uh stay there sir

[2:24:11.980 --> 2:24:15.340]  we are back live thank you so much for joining us
[2:24:15.340 --> 2:24:18.700]  dr ebb and veera is our guest we'll give you his website before he leaves us
[2:24:18.700 --> 2:24:24.060]  okay let's get right into upwards of 30 states now and we've got an alabama representative
[2:24:24.060 --> 2:24:28.540]  coming on the next few days got a state senator from texas coming on multiple bills in texas
[2:24:28.540 --> 2:24:33.100]  including telling the feds how you're not protecting the borders the state's going to do it uh the
[2:24:33.100 --> 2:24:36.780]  states as you know but the listeners may not created the federal government it's now been
[2:24:36.780 --> 2:24:40.940]  globalized so it's illegitimate uh but you've been pushing for this for a long time but not
[2:24:40.940 --> 2:24:45.980]  just the states at the county city level these committees of safety break down your view and
[2:24:45.980 --> 2:24:51.180]  your take and are you buoyed by the fact that we see a massive states rights movement going on right
[2:24:51.180 --> 2:24:58.700]  now doctor well what's encouraging about number one is that obviously the educational process
[2:24:58.700 --> 2:25:04.140]  has worked at the legis legislative level it's state legislators who are pushing this now
[2:25:04.860 --> 2:25:08.460]  for the first time i mean yeah you've been pushing it i've been pushing it to private
[2:25:08.460 --> 2:25:14.940]  citizens have been out there uh attempting to convince these folks that the state's position
[2:25:14.940 --> 2:25:20.540]  in the constitutional system has to be reinvigorated if you will and reinforced or enforced really
[2:25:20.540 --> 2:25:24.060]  and now they're beginning to pick up on this of course it's the economic circumstances
[2:25:24.060 --> 2:25:28.940]  that are doing it but whatever the reason it's happening uh the next step is for that be fleshed
[2:25:28.940 --> 2:25:35.020]  out in terms of uh to what particular problems of greatest immediate importance uh does state
[2:25:35.020 --> 2:25:39.820]  sovereignty extend you mentioned one of them obviously in places like texas and arizona you have
[2:25:39.820 --> 2:25:44.460]  and new mexico you have the illegal immigration problem uh but there are a number of these uh
[2:25:44.460 --> 2:25:48.460]  what i would call homeland security local homeland security problems that they have to deal with
[2:25:48.460 --> 2:25:53.580]  and then thirdly and this is of course a sequential matter it's not going to come
[2:25:53.580 --> 2:25:58.860]  in the same resolution or the same uh statute that starts the process uh there has to be
[2:25:58.860 --> 2:26:06.140]  consideration to given to given to how state sovereignty is going to be enforced it's not
[2:26:06.140 --> 2:26:12.380]  enough to tell those people in washington that the states have constitutional authority
[2:26:12.380 --> 2:26:17.660]  that the states are sick and tired of the uh general government in washington interfering
[2:26:17.660 --> 2:26:23.580]  with that unconstitutionally and imposing its own uh attempted control from states and localities
[2:26:24.140 --> 2:26:32.700]  but there has to be a mechanism for enforcing this limitation on the general government number one
[2:26:32.700 --> 2:26:40.780]  and uh essentially making these reserved state powers function again and all i would tell people
[2:26:40.780 --> 2:26:44.940]  it's a constitution tell us what the answer to that is second amendment a well-regulated
[2:26:44.940 --> 2:26:49.100]  militia being necessary to the security of a free state and ultimately that's what the
[2:26:49.100 --> 2:26:54.460]  tenth amendment is looking towards a free state a state with certain kinds of reserved powers
[2:26:54.460 --> 2:26:59.260]  powers to the state itself while powers to the people and that's what we've been getting away
[2:26:59.260 --> 2:27:03.500]  from now we have to go back to basic principles and that basic principle ultimately is that each
[2:27:03.500 --> 2:27:09.340]  state has to pass the necessary legislation to revitalize its militia structure and bring
[2:27:09.340 --> 2:27:14.700]  every adult male and female citizen of that state into that structure in one way or another
[2:27:14.700 --> 2:27:20.860]  to make it absolutely clear to those people in washington that we do not need their interference
[2:27:20.860 --> 2:27:27.580]  we do not want their interference and they would i would suspect look at that kind of a structure
[2:27:27.580 --> 2:27:32.700]  and be highly deterred from attempting to push that interference too far
[2:27:35.500 --> 2:27:40.700]  you know a lot of people say oh this doesn't have a chance what can we do they have a loser
[2:27:40.700 --> 2:27:45.180]  mentality and don't understand it was five percent of the population started won the revolutionary
[2:27:45.180 --> 2:27:50.860]  war you're an expert on that as well and that this we have a great chance if we believe in it
[2:27:50.860 --> 2:27:54.940]  and point out how bankrupt and unconstitutional the federal government's activities are right now
[2:27:54.940 --> 2:27:59.500]  as they federalize the state police as they federalize local governments as they federalize
[2:27:59.500 --> 2:28:07.820]  with bills the universities now i mean the feds are openly taking over it is the duty not just
[2:28:07.820 --> 2:28:12.380]  the right under the declaration of independence and the tenth and ninth amendment for us to say no
[2:28:12.380 --> 2:28:17.580]  and rectify this i mean time magazine and newsweek are openly announcing a new bank of the world
[2:28:17.580 --> 2:28:23.260]  will rule the united states and set all our policies we must do this we've got 30 states
[2:28:23.260 --> 2:28:28.300]  passing or preparing to pass bills we need to then put pressure to have those enforced i mean
[2:28:28.300 --> 2:28:33.820]  can you speak to the fact that we we can win this thing well of course we can there's no way
[2:28:33.820 --> 2:28:39.260]  that some bank of the world can force us to use its currency that's an absurdity we have to
[2:28:39.260 --> 2:28:43.100]  exceed to that we have to accept it we have to go along with it we have to surrender to them
[2:28:43.660 --> 2:28:48.620]  the fact of the matter is we are the vast majority of people in this country the other side has a
[2:28:48.620 --> 2:28:53.740]  very small number and the people on that side probably a large number of them would change sides
[2:28:54.300 --> 2:29:00.140]  in any kind of crisis situation and ideologically wed to that leviathan in washington secondly we
[2:29:00.140 --> 2:29:04.700]  are the people in actual possession of the property and the resources of this country as well as
[2:29:04.700 --> 2:29:10.060]  the ability to exercise you know intelligence with the ones that run the machines with the
[2:29:10.060 --> 2:29:15.740]  ones that make the the society function so if the vast majority is in possession of the real
[2:29:15.740 --> 2:29:21.100]  resources why are we so worried about them they have a lot of paper and we can repudiate that
[2:29:21.100 --> 2:29:25.820]  paper most of us generated unconstitutional anyway i think we can definitely win this
[2:29:25.820 --> 2:29:34.300]  because a we are the majority and b we have direct control i hope still over our state
[2:29:34.300 --> 2:29:39.340]  legislative process dr ebb and viera we've got a break long segment coming up let's continue
[2:29:39.340 --> 2:29:43.420]  breaking this down on the other side that i'm going to get into pentagon brainwashing and

[2:35:02.300 --> 2:35:08.220]  great system okay going back to dr. Edwin Vieira let's continue with the states uh
[2:35:09.500 --> 2:35:14.300]  for those that don't know maybe you should talk about the history how the states created a compact
[2:35:14.300 --> 2:35:19.900]  to create the federal government their right to abolish it or remove it or amend it instead we
[2:35:19.900 --> 2:35:25.100]  have the feds openly training local police openly setting all the standards openly taking over and
[2:35:25.100 --> 2:35:30.620]  the feds themselves as if you know the federal government wasn't bad enough are now openly controlled
[2:35:30.620 --> 2:35:36.060]  by foreign banks openly signing away congress's authority the president under the presidential
[2:35:36.060 --> 2:35:41.020]  decision directive 51 and others is saying the congress is ceremonial congress isn't allowed in
[2:35:41.020 --> 2:35:46.780]  the highest security clearances to see you know the full plans can you speak to that dr. Edwin
[2:35:46.780 --> 2:35:52.380]  Vieira well of course it's a constitutional impossibility you know you've run down this list
[2:35:52.380 --> 2:35:56.780]  of things and one checks off only one box next to the one constitutional unconstitutional
[2:35:56.780 --> 2:36:02.140]  unconstitutional so what's the real problem here it's the practical one that the constitutional
[2:36:02.140 --> 2:36:07.020]  checks and balances in the system are not being put into operation it's not that they're not
[2:36:07.020 --> 2:36:10.540]  functional of course they're functional it's that they're not being put into operation they're not
[2:36:10.540 --> 2:36:14.540]  being put into operation at the judicial level because we watched the supreme court look the
[2:36:14.540 --> 2:36:19.500]  other way with this question of mr. obama's eligibility for the president which i should
[2:36:19.500 --> 2:36:23.420]  presidency which i should think is a fundamentally important issue no problem there they look the
[2:36:23.420 --> 2:36:28.780]  other way we look at what you were talking about presidential national security decision directive
[2:36:28.780 --> 2:36:34.860]  51 which at least in principle it's an assertion of presidential control over the entire system
[2:36:34.860 --> 2:36:39.180]  all checks and balances are gone do we see congress responding to this even with a resolution
[2:36:39.180 --> 2:36:44.300]  saying absolutely not we're the ones in control here not you of course we don't see that do we
[2:36:44.300 --> 2:36:49.100]  see the states well now we're beginning to see the states we're beginning to see this process of
[2:36:49.100 --> 2:36:54.300]  check and balances work actually from the way that should always have worked from the bottom up
[2:36:54.300 --> 2:37:00.380]  and the final layer the foundational structure as i love to keep telling people we're told this over
[2:37:00.380 --> 2:37:04.860]  and over again the constitution a well-regulated militia is necessary to the security of free
[2:37:04.860 --> 2:37:11.420]  state the only thing the constitution says is necessary for any purpose whatsoever and necessary
[2:37:11.420 --> 2:37:16.860]  for the ultimate purpose but it depends upon what it depends upon actual participation by people
[2:37:16.860 --> 2:37:21.900]  it's not a spectator sport to live in a free society requires self-government and therefore
[2:37:21.900 --> 2:37:26.140]  it requires some kind of commitment and activity and that's what we haven't seen in the past
[2:37:26.140 --> 2:37:30.700]  we're beginning to see people wake up to that obviously these state legislatures who are the
[2:37:30.700 --> 2:37:36.860]  legislators who are passing these tenth amendment or state sovereignty resolutions are taking a
[2:37:36.860 --> 2:37:41.660]  stand on this and it's wonderful from an educational point of view but as i said earlier in the show
[2:37:41.660 --> 2:37:48.380]  we need to begin thinking about the implementation of those the reassertion of actual state power
[2:37:48.380 --> 2:37:53.660]  and legal authority as an effective check and balance not simply a rhetorical check and balance
[2:37:54.220 --> 2:37:59.900]  we're at that stage now the rhetoric is coming out that's excellent the next step is the practice
[2:38:02.380 --> 2:38:08.620]  absolutely and you know the good news is when you look at the state resolutions in Alabama in
[2:38:08.620 --> 2:38:15.660]  new hampshire in colorado they've now passed it in oklahoma through the house and many other
[2:38:15.660 --> 2:38:19.980]  states are passing it they're saying look the federal government isn't protecting the borders
[2:38:19.980 --> 2:38:23.900]  we will because you're not doing a responsibility we're doing this under tenth amendment rights
[2:38:23.900 --> 2:38:28.060]  and ninth amendment look we know you're building fema camps we i mean it's in the bills i have
[2:38:28.060 --> 2:38:33.660]  them right here a new one house bill 225 that under marshal law hb 225 alabama you will not
[2:38:33.660 --> 2:38:40.060]  be allowed to wanton lycee's firearms in case of declared state of emergency on and on and on and
[2:38:40.060 --> 2:38:47.820]  they cite in these bills the pdds the executive orders uh... the federal bills the camps i mean
[2:38:47.820 --> 2:38:52.860]  this is showing a high level of education and i talked to the state reps probably interviewed
[2:38:52.860 --> 2:38:57.820]  more than 20 of the last few weeks we've got more coming on this week the understanding is exploding
[2:38:57.820 --> 2:39:01.740]  i mean they know as much as i do i don't know they know as much as you do you study this so
[2:39:01.740 --> 2:39:06.620]  closely but they are highly informed and they tell me that the knowledge of this is spreading
[2:39:06.620 --> 2:39:11.820]  like wildfire through government not just state government but the sub parts the counties the
[2:39:11.820 --> 2:39:17.500]  cities the police so is i mean that is very very exciting so speak to that and then i'd like you
[2:39:17.500 --> 2:39:23.820]  talk about not just the state level but the county the the power of the juries the grand juries
[2:39:23.820 --> 2:39:29.580]  the power of the sheriffs the power of the committees of safety the human spearheading
[2:39:29.580 --> 2:39:35.580]  well if we go back to that first educational point the thing that interests me about this
[2:39:35.580 --> 2:39:41.260]  is that it does not to be seem to be a sectional phenomenon this isn't something coming up only
[2:39:41.260 --> 2:39:46.860]  in say alabama or mississippi or only coming up in some of those far west and rocky mountain
[2:39:46.860 --> 2:39:53.900]  states it's essentially all over the country and that's from my perspective at least a very good
[2:39:53.900 --> 2:40:03.980]  sign that we really have a national awakening and a refusal any longer to simply acquiesce
[2:40:04.540 --> 2:40:08.860]  in what's been going on now if you look at response i said before enforcement mechanisms
[2:40:08.860 --> 2:40:13.340]  or responses there are probably a number of them that can can be brought into play obviously
[2:40:13.340 --> 2:40:19.260]  you know if you go to the jury system informed individuals on a jury are going to take very
[2:40:19.260 --> 2:40:24.380]  seriously their responsibilities and we may see that certain unjust laws don't get themselves
[2:40:24.380 --> 2:40:28.540]  enforced not because the jury's essentially nullified them because they simply don't convict
[2:40:28.540 --> 2:40:33.260]  these people they don't find the reasonable now necessary uh beyond a reasonable doubt
[2:40:33.260 --> 2:40:37.420]  necessary to convict people under some of these statutes and under those circumstances there's
[2:40:37.420 --> 2:40:41.420]  absolutely nothing that can be done the statutes simply find themselves to be unenforceable on
[2:40:41.420 --> 2:40:46.380]  the other side uh grand juries at least in those states where the grand juries are not entirely
[2:40:46.380 --> 2:40:53.420]  controlled by prosecutors or prosecuting attorneys and state court judges we may see some of the more
[2:40:53.420 --> 2:41:00.940]  horrendous oppression being challenged and indictments being issued i have a feeling that
[2:41:00.940 --> 2:41:05.020]  that may be one of the last steps actually because the first thing that has to be brought
[2:41:05.020 --> 2:41:10.860]  under control uh is what you were suggesting with the use of of sheriffs as a for instance uh i am
[2:41:10.860 --> 2:41:17.100]  not so inclined to think that the sheriffs are enough i think it's very good that they are waking
[2:41:17.100 --> 2:41:21.740]  up to their responsibilities and very good they are waking up to the excessive intrusion
[2:41:22.540 --> 2:41:26.380]  at the state and local level that we're seeing from the federal so-called federal law enforcement
[2:41:26.380 --> 2:41:33.100]  agencies uh but until we have the ultimate backup there until we have the organization
[2:41:33.100 --> 2:41:38.140]  of very large numbers of people in state militias i don't think the sheriffs are going to prove
[2:41:38.140 --> 2:41:42.540]  to be sufficient to deal with this problem i think that's the key ultimately it's organization
[2:41:43.260 --> 2:41:48.540]  of the people themselves we've allowed allowed the other side to tell us how we're going to be
[2:41:48.540 --> 2:41:54.060]  organized in their phony political parties in their phony special interest groups and then
[2:41:54.060 --> 2:41:59.980]  otherwise to divide and conquer us so that we haven't been able to put together uh our unity
[2:41:59.980 --> 2:42:07.100]  really in in at the level of force that it could it could exercise and ultimately the one way to
[2:42:07.100 --> 2:42:13.020]  do that with constitutional authority this is the clear element in it constitutional authority
[2:42:13.020 --> 2:42:16.700]  from the national level all the way down the local level because remember that militia of the
[2:42:16.700 --> 2:42:21.420]  several states are elements of the federal constitution not simply within the states and
[2:42:21.420 --> 2:42:27.100]  the localities is to revitalize those organizations and organize we're talking about tens of millions
[2:42:27.100 --> 2:42:32.380]  of people here not a few thousand a hundred thousand but literally tens of millions of people
[2:42:32.380 --> 2:42:37.580]  and if the that kind of organization won't be sufficient uh to back up the sheriffs to back
[2:42:37.580 --> 2:42:42.940]  up the uh local and state officials to back up the grand juries well then what would be
[2:42:43.740 --> 2:42:51.340]  well dr ebb and the era constitutional law scholar and attorney the feds no and i want to
[2:42:51.340 --> 2:42:54.380]  get your response to this i know you're aware of this but i want to you know for the audience
[2:42:54.380 --> 2:42:59.180]  break this down for those that may not be fully aware of this key element they know the states
[2:42:59.180 --> 2:43:02.540]  have the right to abolish the criminal federal government they know the states have the right
[2:43:02.540 --> 2:43:08.060]  through grand juries and other mechanisms of state legislative investigations uh to go after
[2:43:08.700 --> 2:43:13.260]  criminals in government these foreign bankers that have usurped the federal power and are now
[2:43:13.260 --> 2:43:17.900]  usurping the state power so we're forced to carry out this operation against them or they're going
[2:43:17.900 --> 2:43:24.220]  to fully destroy the republic itself some spin this as if we're trying to get rid of the republic
[2:43:24.220 --> 2:43:29.340]  by secession no we're having the states re declare their powers uh but when you study this
[2:43:29.980 --> 2:43:33.580]  you know the feds are coming in under emergency management saying we tell the local police what
[2:43:33.580 --> 2:43:41.900]  to do uh you know they're clearly uh uh usurping the system and the establishment knows their
[2:43:41.900 --> 2:43:47.100]  bureaucracy their police their feds aren't even enough that's why we've seen for decades the feds
[2:43:47.100 --> 2:43:51.660]  setting this up but now under obama they're actually launching the full operation for a million man
[2:43:51.660 --> 2:43:59.340]  and a civilian corps the pentagons now sign the order to start the civilian corps uh to to to co-op
[2:43:59.340 --> 2:44:04.700]  the preachers the pastors the community and and and give them uh you know little federal
[2:44:04.700 --> 2:44:14.140]  signants even secret operations like infregard 25 000 plus uh executives uh in in uh government
[2:44:14.140 --> 2:44:19.900]  and in corporations being given secret this is mainstream news licensed to kill orders and firearms
[2:44:19.900 --> 2:44:26.220]  so we have a covert true espionage operation by the globalists through the feds going on and that
[2:44:26.220 --> 2:44:32.300]  shows they know the policies they're bringing in are going to foment revolt and and and and proper
[2:44:32.300 --> 2:44:37.260]  right to revolt under what i'd call you know the the article 10 in new hampshire right to revolt
[2:44:37.260 --> 2:44:41.100]  you know one of the strongest out there so so when you speak to what i just laid out there
[2:44:41.100 --> 2:44:48.860]  this is a real war going on in our communities well let's recall uh one of them is that within
[2:44:48.860 --> 2:44:54.140]  the general government itself we actually have two categories of individuals we have what i would
[2:44:54.140 --> 2:45:00.220]  call the loyal public servants who are actually trying to live within the spirit at least of the
[2:45:00.220 --> 2:45:04.140]  constitution is difficult to live within the letter given the extent of unconstitutional
[2:45:04.140 --> 2:45:09.020]  activity by that entity and then we have what i like to call the rogue public officials these
[2:45:09.020 --> 2:45:13.980]  are the ones who either don't care or intentionally are violating the constitution for some individual
[2:45:13.980 --> 2:45:19.500]  gains usually careerism of one kind or another uh those people are really actually acting in a
[2:45:19.500 --> 2:45:25.660]  at least a quasi-criminal capacity so i think that number one they are not uniform at that level
[2:45:25.660 --> 2:45:30.380]  all right they are not in the in a as it were in a unitary conspiracy against us we have allies
[2:45:30.380 --> 2:45:36.380]  there as well as at the state and local level but on the other side of that coin they obviously have
[2:45:36.380 --> 2:45:42.940]  a long-term game plan i love this thing that obama has uh pointed up this i this idea that they
[2:45:42.940 --> 2:45:49.420]  need a uh huge civilian national security force at least as large and well equipped as the armed
[2:45:49.420 --> 2:45:56.140]  armed forces and so forth and so on that is exactly my point that is precisely what we need and the
[2:45:56.140 --> 2:46:01.980]  constitution tells us where we're supposed to find that organization but this is a federal
[2:46:01.980 --> 2:46:07.500]  he has made my point and i agree with him 100 percent if we had that organization we would
[2:46:07.500 --> 2:46:12.620]  solve a great deal of the problems in this country but he's creating a federal doppelganger of the
[2:46:12.620 --> 2:46:17.980]  militia that serves the central state so yeah that's right that's right but he's but you see
[2:46:17.980 --> 2:46:23.740]  he's it he's admitted the principle he's admitted the principle now we say thank you very much barak
[2:46:23.740 --> 2:46:29.340]  let's go over here to this page on the constitution and we see how to implement this in a sense he's
[2:46:29.340 --> 2:46:33.500]  being hoisted with his own petard because from a propagandistic point of view it's going to be very
[2:46:33.500 --> 2:46:37.740]  difficult for him to say well i don't want this organization if you people control it then that
[2:46:37.740 --> 2:46:42.860]  wakes everybody up oh you want the organization if you control it we're going to have some kind of
[2:46:42.860 --> 2:46:48.700]  hitler youth here or some kind of red guards or come somehow that's what you want to set up aha
[2:46:48.700 --> 2:46:54.220]  now we go to the next level of public awareness what we're really dealing with it's no longer
[2:46:54.220 --> 2:46:58.940]  listening to alex jones say this it's listening to barack obama tell us that he wants it this way
[2:46:58.940 --> 2:47:03.900]  i think it's extraordinarily dangerous the position he's put himself in from his point of
[2:47:03.900 --> 2:47:08.380]  view because he's made my point he's made the constitutional point the situation has become
[2:47:08.380 --> 2:47:13.340]  so dire in this country that we have to go to that essentially that last line of defense
[2:47:13.340 --> 2:47:17.900]  and the constitution tells us who's supposed to be in that last line of defense it's us not him
[2:47:17.900 --> 2:47:22.940]  doctor ebony viera here's my issue we can say that there's the good guys in government in the
[2:47:22.940 --> 2:47:27.020]  rogues and we know it's the good men and women who have held this back and slowed it down but
[2:47:27.020 --> 2:47:32.460]  now it's it's it total tyranny is arriving and we saw this in germany and russia and other places
[2:47:32.460 --> 2:47:36.860]  the rogues have gotten in all the major power positions at the highest levels they're bringing
[2:47:36.860 --> 2:47:42.540]  in their personnel expanding their cadres and i think it's fair to say this is a completely
[2:47:43.100 --> 2:47:49.340]  rogue government uh... at you know every major operational level the directives are rogue there
[2:47:49.340 --> 2:47:54.140]  may be people that sluggishly implemented throughout the machinery but i think we need to declare this
[2:47:54.140 --> 2:47:58.780]  as the founding fathers did as patrick henry did as a completely bankrupt rogue government
[2:47:59.500 --> 2:48:03.020]  well except for the fact that the the major element in the government
[2:48:03.020 --> 2:48:07.980]  which the constitution tells us is the net the one necessary we haven't yet implemented it
[2:48:08.860 --> 2:48:13.900]  we're the ones who are this ultimate uh... power in the government and for a hundred and
[2:48:13.900 --> 2:48:18.780]  some fifty years uh... the people in control in one and then to a large extent the state
[2:48:18.780 --> 2:48:25.340]  governments have let the militia after five to the point that they are i won't you know your phone
[2:48:25.340 --> 2:48:37.580]  was cutting out there doctor we may have lost him folks they've usurped the militia and that's
[2:48:37.580 --> 2:48:41.980]  what they do when the police walk over to you and say don't videotape us when you're standing a hundred
[2:48:41.980 --> 2:48:46.140]  yards away or when they come up so you can't videotape the golden gate bridge but everybody
[2:48:46.140 --> 2:48:50.380]  else can they can serve value in google maps has it right there they are exercising power
[2:48:50.940 --> 2:48:54.380]  just like we don't exercise our power to be sovereigns and stand up and have liberty
[2:48:54.940 --> 2:48:59.660]  we've been called we've been intimidated we've been trained and taught to stand down
[2:49:02.140 --> 2:49:05.900]  and they've trained us to be slaves they've trained us like a train of dog
[2:49:05.900 --> 2:49:11.500]  to follow orders and do what we're told and so we have to have this awakening to how bankrupt
[2:49:11.500 --> 2:49:17.660]  they are and how what they've set up is a counterfeit of our country and they're now even removing
[2:49:17.660 --> 2:49:24.940]  the final uh... even ceremonial uh... vestiges of freedom here these are illegitimate criminals
[2:49:24.940 --> 2:49:30.380]  sir uh... you know your phone broke up there uh... please continue with your point back now i was
[2:49:30.380 --> 2:49:36.380]  well no i i agree with you all i'm saying is we can't allow that to deep and deflect us
[2:49:36.380 --> 2:49:42.380]  from our own course yes this is what they're doing but one is the one way in the long run
[2:49:42.380 --> 2:49:48.700]  to defeat them it's to organize ourselves on a sound constitutional basis with legal authority
[2:49:48.700 --> 2:49:54.380]  and the power at the local level we can do that if we simply will ourselves to do it
[2:49:55.340 --> 2:49:59.740]  i don't see how they can stop a short of imposing that ultimate police state tyranny
[2:49:59.740 --> 2:50:03.420]  and then all obviously at that stage when they attempt to do that all bets are off
[2:50:03.420 --> 2:50:06.700]  we're in the declaration of independent situation and
[2:50:06.700 --> 2:50:10.780]  that you know that it's a matter of as much as this political power comes out of the bell
[2:50:10.780 --> 2:50:15.740]  barrel of a gun we're not quite there yet we still have the ability if we're willing
[2:50:15.740 --> 2:50:20.860]  and smart enough to take the steps necessary to bring ourselves back into that constitutional
[2:50:20.860 --> 2:50:27.420]  structure uh... and all i'm looking for is the next step in what we've seen in the sovereignty
[2:50:27.420 --> 2:50:32.380]  resolutions the enforcement mechanism all right let's talk about the resolutions to the logical
[2:50:32.380 --> 2:50:36.940]  conclusions stay there let's talk about those enforcement mechanisms and what you've really
[2:50:36.940 --> 2:50:40.540]  been pushing these uh... committees of security or
[2:50:43.020 --> 2:50:47.740]  you know committees of uh... you know public order how the people take back control their
[2:50:47.740 --> 2:50:51.740]  government and in the other ace in the hole the enemy has stage terror attacks
[2:50:52.540 --> 2:50:56.780]  you know when oklahoma and others pass resolutions saying they weren't going under you and control
[2:50:56.780 --> 2:50:59.740]  we know what happened at oklahoma city and we know who did it stay with us
[2:50:59.740 --> 2:51:06.300]  have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power if so this is going to be

[2:51:15.740 --> 2:51:20.860]  backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most unlike gas generators
[2:51:20.860 --> 2:51:26.220]  a solar generator runs quietly emits no fumes and produces electricity for free it's like having
[2:51:26.220 --> 2:51:31.900]  an electric power plant running quietly in your own home run some pumps shortwave radios computers
[2:51:31.900 --> 2:51:36.860]  and even keep food from spoiling whether it's hurricanes ice storms brownouts or blackouts

[2:54:19.660 --> 2:54:24.780]  with you in the committees of safety modeled after what happened in the decade before the
[2:54:24.780 --> 2:54:29.900]  revolutionary war people communicated and set up their own true government outside the british
[2:54:29.900 --> 2:54:38.300]  regional unelected governors um this is an organizational fight in summation uh how do
[2:54:38.300 --> 2:54:42.300]  folks support you how do they get involved how do they take your great constitutional ideas
[2:54:42.300 --> 2:54:49.340]  and uh put them into action in the field well first they can go to news with views dot com
[2:54:49.340 --> 2:54:54.780]  there's a large archive there of articles i have written on these subjects over the past several
[2:54:54.780 --> 2:55:02.540]  years uh then number two they can go to committees of safety dot com or committees of safety dot org
[2:55:03.420 --> 2:55:08.860]  and you'll see what some people at least are doing to uh attempt to revitalize malicious
[2:55:08.860 --> 2:55:13.820]  structures and other forms of local organization to deal with these problems in a strictly
[2:55:13.820 --> 2:55:19.820]  constitutional fashion and you can find some links there uh to my books and some dvds that
[2:55:19.820 --> 2:55:24.460]  have been put out which will be useful these people tell me that they've been proven to be
[2:55:24.460 --> 2:55:30.620]  very useful and of course at this stage we need education in the second step that first step
[2:55:30.620 --> 2:55:35.020]  the education has succeeded obviously and we're seeing more states passing these sovereignty
[2:55:35.020 --> 2:55:40.780]  resolutions the second step now is to expand that education into the implementation stage
[2:55:40.780 --> 2:55:45.900]  and ultimately that implementation has to be done by local organizing and then through local
[2:55:45.900 --> 2:55:51.900]  organizing bringing grassroots pressure to bear on the state legislatures and passing the next stage
[2:55:52.460 --> 2:55:58.060]  statutes in some of these are monetary reform statutes you look uh indiana has won missouri
[2:55:58.060 --> 2:56:03.740]  has won colorado has won uh montana that the one that's going in there there's one in georgia
[2:56:03.740 --> 2:56:08.060]  they're cropping up all over the country as the result i think of a statute i wrote in new hampshire
[2:56:08.060 --> 2:56:15.020]  several years ago and now if the economic crisis has broken out uh monetary reform which people
[2:56:15.020 --> 2:56:20.460]  were looking at sideways paying no attention to 10 years ago is on the front burner uh very shortly
[2:56:20.460 --> 2:56:24.940]  we're going to see uh as a result of this same crisis or at least the way it will be playing out
[2:56:25.500 --> 2:56:30.140]  that these other issues of local organization and the revitalized revitalization of the militia
[2:56:30.140 --> 2:56:36.300]  will go on to the front burner as well and at that stage we really begin to take back the country
[2:56:36.300 --> 2:56:41.100]  from the local and state level because it's through local and state organizations okay
[2:56:41.100 --> 2:56:44.620]  getting the legislature we're going to do it doctor but the globalist as you know aren't
[2:56:44.620 --> 2:56:50.060]  going to sit on their hands and they are going to stage crises stage wars that's they're very bold
[2:56:50.060 --> 2:56:54.300]  that's why they're in power they take action the people don't at least in in modern times
[2:56:55.420 --> 2:57:00.940]  what do we do about the feds the illegitimate feds staging events staging crises uh i mean
[2:57:00.940 --> 2:57:04.620]  openly saying barack obama may be like linkin they're openly saying they may come in and
[2:57:04.620 --> 2:57:09.660]  swat down states i mean their entire battle buildup and under the john war defense authorization
[2:57:09.660 --> 2:57:14.940]  act they say governors will be federal dual-headed i mean this is all happening well the governors
[2:57:14.940 --> 2:57:18.220]  are let's start with the governor's governor simply have to refuse that if we're talking
[2:57:18.220 --> 2:57:22.780]  about people that have been educated in terms of state sovereignty and the true position of
[2:57:22.780 --> 2:57:26.300]  the states and the constitution they have to refuse to go along with unconstitutional
[2:57:26.300 --> 2:57:30.300]  directives no matter where they come from and ultimately if they're talking about if you're
[2:57:30.300 --> 2:57:34.540]  talking about a scenario in which it's uh the goal is for some of these rogue politicians
[2:57:34.540 --> 2:57:39.820]  to actually suppress a large segments of this country then the only solution to that is for
[2:57:39.820 --> 2:57:44.140]  those large segments of the country to organize them before organize themselves beforehand
[2:57:44.140 --> 2:57:48.220]  i mean the self-government requires self-reliance ultimately self-protection yes well that's what
[2:57:48.220 --> 2:57:52.620]  we're doing we're here mobilizing and then letting folks know the playbook of the globalists that

[3:00:27.020 --> 3:00:32.380]  patriot a conservative that's not the case mexico and the verge of collapsing that's the state
[3:00:32.380 --> 3:00:36.540]  department the yuppies have no idea they're still traveling down there to be shut down by the

[3:09:00.220 --> 3:09:04.700]  powerful state senators saying that they're going to put just state forces on the border because
[3:09:04.700 --> 3:09:08.860]  mexico's collapsing and the feds won't stop it that's the plan it's in the security prosperity
[3:09:08.860 --> 3:09:14.220]  partnership documents to basically let the border collapse and collapse mexico to overrun the u.s
[3:09:14.220 --> 3:09:20.780]  then say a north american union security perimeter contiguous on the north american continent no
[3:09:20.780 --> 3:09:28.220]  longer borders in mexico and canada with the u.s but contiguous from guatemala border with mexico
[3:09:28.220 --> 3:09:32.620]  all the way up to alaska this is all on record and they're going to do it through crises they
[3:09:32.620 --> 3:09:39.420]  create crises banking crises military crises terror crises uh refugee crises and then offer
[3:09:39.420 --> 3:09:44.700]  their solution i told you three years ago they were racing to pass amnesty i'm on record because
[3:09:44.700 --> 3:09:50.220]  mexico was going to collapse and they wanted to go ahead and have the amnesty plan set up
[3:09:50.220 --> 3:09:54.940]  beforehand now it's going to be harder for them um but for the next 10 minutes i always love having
[3:09:54.940 --> 3:10:01.500]  him up once a month and that's a marty shactor of uh calvin pure sub dot com or five star sub dot
[3:10:01.500 --> 3:10:05.260]  com and the reason i have him on is it really is a public service announcement he's not just a great
[3:10:05.260 --> 3:10:12.060]  sponsor uh from now about four or five years marty has been in the organic soap business california
[3:10:12.060 --> 3:10:17.260]  certified organic before they even had that i mean he's the standard of it only sold institutions
[3:10:18.540 --> 3:10:22.700]  and then uh we found out about the soap it was so great and usually organic soap costs two or three
[3:10:22.700 --> 3:10:28.300]  times what the toxic detergents do his is 85 off what the toxic detergents are forget the huge premium
[3:10:28.300 --> 3:10:32.460]  for organic and these are the best organics out there a lot of organics are too strong or burn
[3:10:32.460 --> 3:10:38.540]  you uh he was in chemical weapons in world war two started calvin soap when he got back with his
[3:10:38.540 --> 3:10:44.620]  dad now he runs it with his son and family in oakland california and this is factory direct but
[3:10:44.620 --> 3:10:49.260]  the reason he's here is last time i had him on we didn't have time to get into what is in the stuff
[3:10:49.260 --> 3:10:55.580]  you're using at the store versus what organic soap is marty it's great to have you here with us
[3:10:55.580 --> 3:11:03.020]  hello alex you have reached the department of homeland cleanliness the satisfaction is guaranteed
[3:11:03.020 --> 3:11:11.180]  or double your dirt back let us at calvin bail you out with our stimulus packages of one through
[3:11:11.180 --> 3:11:21.580]  five years of soap at a cost of 40 cents to 20 cents a day no more 20 to 30 that deficits a week
[3:11:21.580 --> 3:11:28.940]  no junk science detergent chemicals no more getting ripped off for cleanliness no more deteriorating
[3:11:28.940 --> 3:11:37.100]  clothing burning skin itching scalp outsourced products no more this is our goal this is our
[3:11:37.100 --> 3:11:44.540]  philosophy and we share it marty let's start at the beginning why did you start calvin
[3:11:44.540 --> 3:11:52.220]  pure soap in 1947 well when i got out of the army in 47 after serving two years in japan
[3:11:53.180 --> 3:12:00.140]  my father left civil service he was getting too old for that they let him go and we discovered
[3:12:00.780 --> 3:12:08.460]  coincidentally going to a supermarket shopping that soap doesn't exist anymore like does like ivory
[3:12:08.460 --> 3:12:14.700]  like fells nafta like white king they were all detergents well i learned in the army what detergents
[3:12:14.700 --> 3:12:20.300]  were they were a poison they were made for poison gases and we said you know that'd be a unique
[3:12:20.300 --> 3:12:27.340]  situation if we could start a small business selling real soap well the only way we could do that
[3:12:27.340 --> 3:12:34.060]  was going to commercial enterprises the hotels motels rest homes convalescent hospitals we couldn't
[3:12:34.060 --> 3:12:41.100]  get on the shelf anyway no way proctor gamble lever and colgate they dominated the marketplace
[3:12:41.740 --> 3:12:48.460]  with billions of dollars worth of advertising and hypnotism and uh all all the ways of brainwashing
[3:12:48.460 --> 3:12:54.300]  the consumer to get these toxic detergents and uh we just started a little small company
[3:12:54.940 --> 3:13:00.220]  my father and i start calling our hospitals and schools and we were accepted because our
[3:13:00.220 --> 3:13:07.340]  products were virtually twice as good and half the price so we built up our business institutionally
[3:13:07.340 --> 3:13:13.580]  and then about four years ago i got a call from jennison's communication network uh what was his
[3:13:13.580 --> 3:13:18.300]  name no it's michael for those actually about seven years ago time flies but but the um marty let's
[3:13:18.300 --> 3:13:25.660]  stop right there the reason toxic waste cost a lot more is because of all the advertising
[3:13:25.660 --> 3:13:29.820]  big oil had all this toxic waste from the refining of oil process i know you were in the
[3:13:29.820 --> 3:13:33.660]  chemical courts you know this but the audience doesn't they have all these byproducts like
[3:13:34.220 --> 3:13:39.660]  sodium fluorides they put in the water that's like china admits they dump their toxic waste in
[3:13:39.660 --> 3:13:44.940]  our food and ship it to us it's how they get rid of toxic waste it's like lawn fertilizer it says
[3:13:44.940 --> 3:13:50.780]  don't use this on vegetable or on farms because it's full of mercury lead our stick it runs off
[3:13:50.780 --> 3:13:58.380]  that's how it's done you discovered all that and put this out and you know we're not kidding when
[3:13:58.380 --> 3:14:03.660]  we tell people what is in these so-called soap that's really detergents uh that uh people
[3:14:05.180 --> 3:14:11.340]  are buying uh at the supermarket so so so i mean break people down briefly break down for folks
[3:14:11.340 --> 3:14:18.220]  what's in your real soap versus the toxic waste they pay for it the uh at the grocery store well
[3:14:18.220 --> 3:14:24.780]  most of the detergents are made for waste petroleum high alkalinity chemicals and another ingredient
[3:14:24.780 --> 3:14:31.660]  that they add in large amounts of sodium chloride and people think that's a new cleaner sodium chloride
[3:14:31.660 --> 3:14:39.020]  is table salt would you wash your face your your body your baby your home with table salt
[3:14:39.900 --> 3:14:47.660]  no we don't believe in that we make our products from vegetable oils coconut oils we use juices
[3:14:47.660 --> 3:14:55.340]  from cherries from almonds uh to instead of perfumes which are toxic and it's been very successful
[3:14:55.340 --> 3:15:01.820]  by the thousands and thousands of alex jones listeners that are buying our products now
[3:15:01.820 --> 3:15:08.460]  repeatedly and it's been a real beneficial to know that we can share products that we've developed
[3:15:08.460 --> 3:15:15.980]  and since 1947 when we started 62 years ago and our slogan developed is our business
[3:15:15.980 --> 3:15:22.460]  is going down the drain and we we're very proud of that that people buy our products that they're
[3:15:22.460 --> 3:15:29.820]  safe that they do the job and they're far far superior that anything offered in the supermarket
[3:15:29.820 --> 3:15:37.420]  right now and it's a pleasure to have to and to be endorsed by alex and and share our knowledge
[3:15:37.420 --> 3:15:41.980]  in our our philosophy well marty you're you're a sweetheart i mean it's just a great product
[3:15:41.980 --> 3:15:48.940]  at a great price for the factory direct 62 years family business uh i guess bob dellum would say
[3:15:48.940 --> 3:15:52.460]  you someday grow in your own garden will be against the law i'm surprised they haven't
[3:15:52.460 --> 3:15:58.300]  banned you even being able to make you know real soap how dare someone do this and not let us rip
[3:15:58.300 --> 3:16:05.580]  everybody off of toxic waste i mean it's such a sick fraud how people pay to be screwed how they pay
[3:16:05.580 --> 3:16:10.540]  to have a bad deal we have to become educated we have to become informed and say no uh let's give

[3:17:49.900 --> 3:18:00.620]  to Irving Berlin blue cross had me agree to a new blue cross policy uh blue cross said i would be
[3:18:00.620 --> 3:18:08.860]  thrilled that blue cross covered me then i took a fall leg in a splint they said i should read all
[3:18:08.860 --> 3:18:17.660]  the fine print when a high fever i ran they said i took out the wrong plan for blue cross there seems
[3:18:17.660 --> 3:18:33.740]  to be plenty for blue cross and none for me all right uh marty shaker we'll talk to you again
[3:18:33.740 --> 3:18:39.020]  next month god bless you i look forward to it thank you alex take care my friend that really is a
[3:18:39.020 --> 3:18:46.060]  great guy in 62 years doing that but i mean just look at how we pay for all these services and then
[3:18:46.060 --> 3:18:51.020]  they just give us toxic waste because they have to pay to store the sodium fluoride and what's
[3:18:51.020 --> 3:18:57.180]  left over when they crack the oil when they refine it just google the oil refining process you can
[3:18:57.180 --> 3:19:03.340]  find all these university diagrams uh from uh you know a petroleum engineers and in science
[3:19:03.340 --> 3:19:08.620]  classes and it'll show you the hundreds of things they make out of oil out of crude oil but then
[3:19:08.620 --> 3:19:13.180]  there's all these other distillates that are toxic waste that is what goes in the soap because
[3:19:13.180 --> 3:19:18.060]  it's not soap it's like the federal reserve isn't federal the patriot act isn't a patriot act when
[3:19:18.060 --> 3:19:22.700]  they pull troops out of a country they call it a build down everything is a semantical lie with
[3:19:22.700 --> 3:19:29.260]  these crooks and uh so we love uh marty he's a great guy five starts up dot com okay uh when we

[3:35:36.220 --> 3:35:40.780]  during collapse uh can you break down though with the internal you've got really what we're facing
[3:35:40.780 --> 3:35:44.780]  sure and let me tell you alex something that i was on fox last week in the morning and and also
[3:35:44.780 --> 3:35:50.060]  with uh in the afternoon one of their new shows and and talked about that fact that last tuesday
[3:35:50.060 --> 3:35:56.460]  is the first time in modern history that texas went on alert and and until i broke that story um
[3:35:56.460 --> 3:36:01.900]  really in fact very few people at the capital knew it and and we have a multiple stage i won't go
[3:36:01.900 --> 3:36:07.260]  into too much detail because of homeland security but we have a multiple stage alert process and we
[3:36:07.260 --> 3:36:12.380]  triggered um or the governor triggered step one of that uh to my knowledge you may have triggered
[3:36:12.380 --> 3:36:17.980]  another step but i think it was step one um and and the reason was alex we saw for the first time
[3:36:17.980 --> 3:36:23.340]  something we had not seen before we have 19 border crossings with mexico and texas and and a couple
[3:36:23.340 --> 3:36:29.020]  of the key bridges you saw those people forming on the other side uh blocking the bridges well we
[3:36:29.020 --> 3:36:34.780]  didn't know if that crowd of 50 would turn into 500 turn into 5000 turn into 50 000 was this the
[3:36:34.780 --> 3:36:40.220]  beginning of the revolution was this the beginning of the takeover and if so we needed to be ready
[3:36:40.220 --> 3:36:46.940]  so that first age alert uh went out that the the plan in texas alex uh and and i've supported
[3:36:46.940 --> 3:36:51.420]  in a number of issues for for a number of years even before i got into the legislature but here's
[3:36:51.420 --> 3:36:57.420]  the here's the breakdown we have six sectors with mexico of that 2000 mile 18 or mile border with
[3:36:57.420 --> 3:37:02.780]  mexico you know two-thirds of it in texas and a lot of it is out there in no man's land you get
[3:37:02.780 --> 3:37:07.500]  down del rio and other places where it's easy to spot people coming across there because they
[3:37:07.500 --> 3:37:11.740]  have to come across the river they have to go over some desert or some pretty sparse area to get up
[3:37:11.740 --> 3:37:17.660]  to a freeway or a highway rather to get to a city that's relatively easy to control but the key is
[3:37:17.660 --> 3:37:21.980]  your big points of entry that's where all the illegals are coming in that's where we need the
[3:37:21.980 --> 3:37:28.380]  fencing that's where we need to beef up um our border patrol our department of public safety
[3:37:28.380 --> 3:37:35.260]  state troopers our our national guard that's what we need to do so it's not like we've got a mass
[3:37:35.260 --> 3:37:41.820]  troops or or personnel along you know 1200 miles 1400 miles of border we simply need to be sure
[3:37:41.820 --> 3:37:48.700]  across from alpaso laredo megalon brownsville and some other key points so we can get this job done
[3:37:48.700 --> 3:37:53.980]  and if there's a refugee problem alex the refugees need to be on in northern mexico not
[3:37:53.980 --> 3:37:59.580]  southern texas because there's two possible scenarios that i see one is the slow economic
[3:37:59.580 --> 3:38:04.700]  meltdown of mexico uh where you just have hundreds of thousands of people i mean beyond the normal
[3:38:04.700 --> 3:38:09.820]  immigration of the illegals coming here out of desperation you know just to eat uh and then
[3:38:09.820 --> 3:38:16.780]  you have the rapid migration mass migration which would happen if calderon was assassinated if if
[3:38:16.780 --> 3:38:21.180]  the drug cartels take over the government like happened in columbia you know last week and again
[3:38:21.180 --> 3:38:25.660]  the the mainstream news doesn't cover this alex but you know last tuesday after the bridge closings
[3:38:25.660 --> 3:38:32.060]  on the mexican side on wednesday there was a a grenade launcher and a bazooka used to take out
[3:38:32.060 --> 3:38:37.180]  eight government officials and renosa which is just south of megaloma because sir as you know
[3:38:37.180 --> 3:38:42.380]  the dallas morning news talked about car bombs killing people in dallas and that's just a tiny
[3:38:42.380 --> 3:38:48.460]  blurb uh rocket attacks on newspapers on the texas border i mean it used to be a thriving
[3:38:49.100 --> 3:38:53.580]  tourist place down there i went down there when i was a kid with my parents it's all shut down
[3:38:53.580 --> 3:38:58.380]  boarded up now and i mean there's we've already been seeing the collapse of mexico with these 30
[3:38:58.380 --> 3:39:02.460]  million illegal aliens that have been flooding in the last decade but you're talking about
[3:39:02.460 --> 3:39:07.580]  a fast collapse how bad from the people studying this the experts you're talking to could it get
[3:39:08.380 --> 3:39:15.740]  well you know the i think what is is is very concerning to me um is that you know if you
[3:39:15.740 --> 3:39:20.620]  talked about this even two years ago yes we've seen that a mass migration of illegal immigrants
[3:39:20.620 --> 3:39:27.180]  into the united states um you know driven by economic factors better jobs here better life here
[3:39:27.180 --> 3:39:34.300]  but we didn't see that because um people in mexico um we're running for running out of fear or
[3:39:34.300 --> 3:39:41.020]  literally um but running because the economy had totally collapsed there and and so what has happened
[3:39:41.020 --> 3:39:45.980]  is if you just said two years ago could mexico collapse people would have laughed uh and i don't
[3:39:45.980 --> 3:39:51.900]  and i'd like to think that it's not probable but it's possible and the fact that's possible alex
[3:39:51.900 --> 3:39:57.020]  that a country uh so large and one of our major trading partners one of our big oil partners
[3:39:57.020 --> 3:40:04.780]  um just a stone's throw across the real grand uh that they could collapse is is is a major issue
[3:40:04.780 --> 3:40:08.460]  for this administration who i don't think will probably know how to handle it
[3:40:08.460 --> 3:40:13.500]  and for this country so obviously you know that the question is what what happens if you have
[3:40:13.500 --> 3:40:18.620]  millions trying to get here you have economic uh chaos in the united states so we've got to
[3:40:18.620 --> 3:40:24.220]  be sure they are not allowed to come here well we already have you know collapsed as you know
[3:40:24.220 --> 3:40:29.020]  along the border from california to here that's already a civil war yeah i mean it's already a
[3:40:29.020 --> 3:40:32.780]  civil war and so yeah now you're trying to be conservative here and saying you know we you
[3:40:32.780 --> 3:40:37.340]  know we hope this doesn't happen and it probably won't happen but it i mean it already is happening
[3:40:37.340 --> 3:40:41.260]  where i've talked to interviewed all these texas sheriffs going back five six years ago where if
[3:40:41.260 --> 3:40:45.820]  they grab a truckload of marijuana or cocaine the mexican troops come across the border put guns
[3:40:45.820 --> 3:40:49.820]  in their heads and say we're going to kill you if you don't give that to them and then homeland
[3:40:49.820 --> 3:40:55.340]  security a year ago told the national guard not to fire back when mexican troops shoot at them
[3:40:55.340 --> 3:40:59.500]  yeah well i mean yeah i can't comment and i've heard those stories i've never been able to
[3:40:59.500 --> 3:41:05.580]  confirm them or verify them um and i had them on and i'm pretty you know strong in that that area
[3:41:05.580 --> 3:41:10.540]  but but i will say this to you that uh just in a week let me tell you how much is changing a week
[3:41:10.540 --> 3:41:16.220]  when i was on fox television last week i i made the statement um i've done the number of radio
[3:41:16.220 --> 3:41:22.940]  interviews telling people in america if you have kids in college do not let them under any circumstance
[3:41:22.940 --> 3:41:30.620]  go to mexico even the resort towns of acapulco or cancun or tozamel do not let them go i was not
[3:41:30.620 --> 3:41:36.300]  to say senator that now the major university organizations today just advised the students
[3:41:36.300 --> 3:41:40.940]  not to go right and i'm talking to people that go down there for honeymoons adults they'll even be
[3:41:40.940 --> 3:41:46.060]  in yucatan that's supposedly safe and they see cops and people busting windows and then the police
[3:41:46.060 --> 3:41:52.060]  come into the resort at 10 01 uh p.m and say you were supposed to be out of the pool give me your
[3:41:52.060 --> 3:41:56.860]  watch give me your wallet it's the government itself collapsing as well isn't it yeah and and
[3:41:56.860 --> 3:42:02.540]  that's the problem there you don't know where to turn to for justice uh about a month ago the the
[3:42:02.540 --> 3:42:08.460]  person in the calderon government who was in charge of the anti kidnapping squad uh was arrested
[3:42:08.460 --> 3:42:13.740]  because he was taking bribes of 450 thousand dollars a month and he was head of the anti
[3:42:13.740 --> 3:42:20.620]  kidnapping charge there was a scheduler who knew the whereabouts of of calderon who supposedly
[3:42:20.620 --> 3:42:24.380]  was being paid a hundred thousand dollars a month just to keep the whereabouts of the president known
[3:42:24.380 --> 3:42:31.340]  to some of the drug cartels um this i mean this is an explosive situation that most likely will get
[3:42:31.340 --> 3:42:38.940]  worse before it gets better car bombs i mean a high level assault on government um and and i think
[3:42:38.940 --> 3:42:45.340]  that the big question that the calderon government will have to resolve and the obama administration
[3:42:45.340 --> 3:42:50.460]  will we send american troops into mexico at some point to help the mexican government
[3:42:50.460 --> 3:42:55.980]  we had to do it twice before and and and so far the mexican government has not one of the troops
[3:42:55.980 --> 3:43:01.980]  and obviously our troops are stretched stretched thin um and you don't want to be in the in the
[3:43:01.980 --> 3:43:07.740]  middle of that type of war but um this is coming in the look here here's here's the good news if
[3:43:07.740 --> 3:43:11.820]  there's good news out of here the reason we've seen an escalation of violence and and and really
[3:43:11.820 --> 3:43:16.940]  civil war along the northern border is because when vincente fox was president he did basically
[3:43:16.940 --> 3:43:23.100]  nothing in terms of drug law enforcement when calderon came in he came in and he has 45 thousand
[3:43:23.100 --> 3:43:28.540]  soldiers uh spread across mexico taking on the drug cartels so they're in a fight i mean it's a
[3:43:28.540 --> 3:43:33.740]  battle and so the drug cartels are battling the government he's battling back and so that's a
[3:43:33.740 --> 3:43:39.500]  positive but in that positive it has created this great carnage um and and it's just terrible
[3:43:39.500 --> 3:43:44.940]  violence uh that's impacting our country as well so the situation has to be watched closely by
[3:43:44.940 --> 3:43:49.740]  those of us in texas new mexico well senator patrick let me throw this in on the in the
[3:43:49.740 --> 3:43:54.540]  six minutes we have left with your seven minutes because we don't have much time here specifically
[3:43:54.540 --> 3:43:59.180]  though you've been on tv talking about if the feds won't protect the border the state needs to do it
[3:43:59.180 --> 3:44:05.260]  can you speak to that yeah well um what actually when i ran for office i'm a i'm serving my second
[3:44:05.260 --> 3:44:12.380]  session and when i ran back in 2005 um i made the point that yes it's the federal government's
[3:44:12.380 --> 3:44:17.260]  responsibility that's what my opponents kept saying i said that is true but it's texas problem
[3:44:17.260 --> 3:44:21.900]  and we're going to have to solve it and i believe governor perry has the will and i believe others
[3:44:21.900 --> 3:44:27.180]  of us have the will in texas that if the federal government does not react we must react okay what
[3:44:27.180 --> 3:44:31.420]  is that plan i mean you put the state police in there do you know emergency funding that before
[3:44:31.420 --> 3:44:37.980]  it's it's it's a it's a series it's a series of uh it's a number of plans number one you've got to
[3:44:37.980 --> 3:44:42.940]  send more aid to the county sheriffs who are on the they're the frontline battle guys secondly
[3:44:42.940 --> 3:44:48.140]  you've got to work in border patrol and and what about texas fence what about a texas fence well
[3:44:48.140 --> 3:44:53.420]  as i said a moment ago it is a waste of resources to put a fence out the middle of no man's land
[3:44:53.420 --> 3:44:57.660]  because god has given us a natural fence called the one of grand but what about in the key areas
[3:44:57.660 --> 3:45:03.260]  but but in the key areas that's where we need it now 90% of the land on the border is texas land
[3:45:03.260 --> 3:45:08.460]  so we have a lot of authority there um we have to you know there are some constitutional provisions
[3:45:08.460 --> 3:45:13.820]  that that we have to be careful of but at the end of the day we have the texas state guard several
[3:45:13.820 --> 3:45:19.020]  thousand strong which could grow quickly i think volunteers would step up very quickly we have the
[3:45:19.020 --> 3:45:23.980]  national guard that the governor can call out we have a large state police force we have our game
[3:45:23.980 --> 3:45:28.940]  wardens we have our dps and all working in concert with the border patrol but you can't
[3:45:28.940 --> 3:45:36.860]  tie their hands i believe if if we made a a a made a major priority to ratchet up our level of
[3:45:36.860 --> 3:45:41.660]  of the on the ground every time we put boots on the ground we see illegal immigration go down
[3:45:41.660 --> 3:45:46.140]  dramatically senator for what you've said we need to put them there now because it could collapse
[3:45:46.140 --> 3:45:51.500]  any day any month any year we're already seeing a collapse so are you moving now to go ahead and
[3:45:51.500 --> 3:45:55.980]  draw up the plan while it's in session perfect timing and get the forces down there we need
[3:45:56.540 --> 3:46:02.140]  well the the the plan is to be drawn up by the homeland security director and and with the governor's
[3:46:02.140 --> 3:46:08.380]  oversight um and and obviously the fact that i'm speaking out and others are speaking out we are
[3:46:08.380 --> 3:46:15.660]  making sure there's attention to that plan uh and secondly we we already have in place um i believe
[3:46:15.660 --> 3:46:21.980]  the assets to move relatively quickly um and i mean relatively quickly in in the worst case
[3:46:21.980 --> 3:46:30.540]  scenario so i am i am confident um that in a worst case scenario um we will be ready to meet that
[3:46:30.540 --> 3:46:35.340]  challenge i'm also confident that we're taking the right steps we need now senator patrick the big
[3:46:35.340 --> 3:46:39.580]  issue here is you can't we can't tie the hands of the police if they're down there being shot at
[3:46:39.580 --> 3:46:44.060]  they need to open up on the on these are real terrorists not the little ones sneaking around
[3:46:44.060 --> 3:46:47.900]  underneath the desk the government's taking all our liberties to fight you know this is real terrorism
[3:46:47.900 --> 3:46:53.740]  they're killing police citizens kidnapping americans i mean we need to move heavy assets down there
[3:46:54.380 --> 3:46:58.700]  mexico's attacked us repeatedly they attacked us during world war one it's i'm not seeing the
[3:46:58.700 --> 3:47:03.020]  government's doing this now but but the i'm sorry to say the people down there and especially the
[3:47:03.020 --> 3:47:07.820]  leadership they hate this country i know you know about the plan of sandiego the german
[3:47:08.380 --> 3:47:13.420]  tried to launch attacks and gave the orders in world war two i mean this is a country that
[3:47:13.420 --> 3:47:17.580]  hates our guts and i'm saying if mexico wants to start something i'm talking about their drug
[3:47:17.580 --> 3:47:23.420]  gangs we need to wipe them out well i think the biggest concern that most of us here have democrats
[3:47:23.420 --> 3:47:28.300]  republicans alike and i'm a conservative reagan republican but i think it's it's across the aisle
[3:47:28.860 --> 3:47:33.180]  all of us are concerned about the transnational gangs and the violence of these gangs
[3:47:33.180 --> 3:47:41.100]  ratcheting up in america to where it has uh... in in new mexico uh i mean in mexico and uh and
[3:47:41.100 --> 3:47:45.180]  also the violence is filling over the border you know a lot of the police officials a lot of the
[3:47:45.180 --> 3:47:51.340]  executives a lot of the government officials who actually work in mexico live across the border
[3:47:51.340 --> 3:47:55.100]  in texas sir that's my final question right that's my friend you know that they're afraid they live
[3:47:55.100 --> 3:48:00.700]  here that's what i'm saying here is that they target police they target military so some you
[3:48:00.700 --> 3:48:05.980]  know they say take money or will kill you this is already spilling over into texas and california
[3:48:05.980 --> 3:48:11.180]  well he's already had seen some of it but we have not be for example in in the war as a seodad
[3:48:11.180 --> 3:48:18.060]  war as i mean uh across from el paso there were sixteen hundred murders in war as which is you know
[3:48:18.060 --> 3:48:22.860]  right across the bridge from el paso there were eighteen murders last year so so far so far
[3:48:23.500 --> 3:48:27.660]  we've been able to hold that level of violence on their side i mean sixteen hundred to eighteen
[3:48:27.660 --> 3:48:32.620]  and those are real facts real numbers is significant and but when those numbers if when we start
[3:48:32.620 --> 3:48:36.780]  say we're already seeing a lot of the minor crime we're seeing the car jackings uh we're seeing
[3:48:36.780 --> 3:48:42.140]  an and major as well but but we have not seen that spill over yet but that's what we're concerned
[3:48:42.140 --> 3:48:47.260]  about but you know as you well know alex the number two city in the in the in the world for
[3:48:47.260 --> 3:48:52.380]  kidnapping is phoenix arizona mexico city is first phoenix arizona yeah it's already here it's on the
[3:48:52.380 --> 3:48:57.980]  media covers up most of it in the diseases in the cholera and the drug resistant tv it's a
[3:48:57.980 --> 3:49:02.620]  it bankrupting the states with all the anchor babies this country is going to fall apart if we don't do
[3:49:02.620 --> 3:49:06.220]  something all i have to say sir is i appreciate what you're doing we're going to support you i'd
[3:49:06.220 --> 3:49:10.780]  like to get you in studio someday here in austin or i'd like to set a crew down but in closing i
[3:49:10.780 --> 3:49:17.420]  got to disagree with you though i am for drug decriminalization if that happened uh these drug
[3:49:17.420 --> 3:49:22.700]  games we start trying to murder politicians that try to decriminalize if we decriminalize not legalize
[3:49:22.700 --> 3:49:28.140]  that would end the four million dollar profit that is funding these people well i know in mexico
[3:49:28.140 --> 3:49:34.060]  supposedly their government is looking at that and and um in closing let me let me just say what's
[3:49:34.060 --> 3:49:38.700]  going to alex i appreciate your focus on this and and and uh also i invite people to go to my
[3:49:38.700 --> 3:49:43.820]  facebook page dan patrick uh they will be my friend and and we keep in touch with what's going on
[3:49:43.820 --> 3:49:49.900]  on a regular basis and uh all and i just lastly i'd like to share and take 10 seconds um we have
[3:49:49.900 --> 3:49:54.540]  an award-winning documentary that we have done which is an incredible story it's a true story
[3:49:54.540 --> 3:50:00.060]  about texas and um it and it's uh it has sold thousands and thousands of copies it's called
[3:50:00.060 --> 3:50:04.700]  the heart of texas and uh if you go to heart of texas the movie i was the executive producer of
[3:50:04.700 --> 3:50:10.700]  the heart of texas the movie dot com it's a christian film part it's a christian film but it's
[3:50:10.700 --> 3:50:17.420]  it's it's a film about what all of his face and life at some point and that's forgiveness um
[3:50:17.420 --> 3:50:21.580]  and it's a wonderful true story that's one of the most amazing stories your audience and you will
[3:50:21.580 --> 3:50:25.500]  ever see i'll send you over a copy and i think you'll be on the air saying folks you got to see
[3:50:25.500 --> 3:50:29.100]  this it's i was about to say let us have you in studio i know you're very busy in the legislative
[3:50:29.100 --> 3:50:34.620]  session let us have you in studio or or we can send a tv crew down we also do local tv and uh and
[3:50:34.620 --> 3:50:39.180]  spend some time on the film because i was interested in it i'd actually already heard about the film
[3:50:39.180 --> 3:50:44.620]  but as this develops let us have you back up soon uh state senator dan patrick thank you so much
[3:50:44.620 --> 3:50:49.740]  thank you sir you bet goodbye okay folks there you heard it and they had to admit mexico's now
[3:50:49.740 --> 3:50:53.980]  looking at trying to decriminalize because it's about to overthrow the government that tried to
[3:50:53.980 --> 3:50:58.540]  come in and take over the drug cartel profits for themselves that's what's really going on stay with us
[3:51:02.140 --> 3:51:06.860]  more than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water and did you know that you have
[3:51:06.860 --> 3:51:11.340]  greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water that's

[3:56:01.420 --> 3:56:06.780]  remember guys tomorrow to spend 20 minutes on this but it's just so important texans unknowingly
[3:56:06.780 --> 3:56:12.540]  donate children's blood to research and this also the american statesman story itself is a whitewash
[3:56:12.540 --> 3:56:17.020]  medical privacy advocates evices say parents should be asked for consent before newborn screening
[3:56:17.020 --> 3:56:22.140]  samples are kept they lie and say it's a state law like they lie and say taking vaccines the state law
[3:56:22.140 --> 3:56:26.780]  and they take your baby's blood for a blood test but with the health department set up under eugenics
[3:56:26.780 --> 3:56:31.580]  so the hospital doing the test and it goes into a federal database and is sold to international
[3:56:31.580 --> 3:56:36.620]  companies who isolate proteins and dna and then patent it and then there's been federal cases
[3:56:36.620 --> 3:56:40.300]  where they say they own your blood and you want to get a gene therapy this company has your genes
[3:56:40.300 --> 3:56:44.300]  already sequenced it goes through the registry and they say you know you got to pay us all this money
[3:56:44.300 --> 3:56:50.540]  to you to be able to have your own gene therapy for almost seven years another lie it's 36 the
[3:56:50.540 --> 3:56:54.540]  state has identified storing blood from nearly all newborns in texas without their parents consent
[3:56:54.540 --> 3:56:59.100]  for possible use of medical research it's not possible use it's being done the blood is remember
[3:56:59.100 --> 3:57:03.180]  i'm telling you this for 13 years the blood is collected as part of a 44 year old state mandate
[3:57:03.180 --> 3:57:10.620]  so see they're saying 44 first it's seven then it's 44 i've confirmed globally 36 years how many
[3:57:10.620 --> 3:57:14.620]  years did i tell you that the bull and show you government documents the blood is collected as
[3:57:14.620 --> 3:57:18.140]  part of a 44 year old state mandate newborn screening program in which hospitals birthing
[3:57:18.140 --> 3:57:25.740]  centers and midwives draw blood from a bad baby seal see it's not in law it's mandated the state
[3:57:25.740 --> 3:57:30.300]  either discards the blood after six months total lie they store it in michigan and san Antonio
[3:57:30.300 --> 3:57:35.020]  or more recently store it for three years before destroying it another lie i'm not saying this
[3:57:35.020 --> 3:57:40.060]  maryan roe sir is bad she just doesn't know what she's talking about but starting in 2002 the state
[3:57:40.060 --> 3:57:43.020]  of the department began collecting and keeping blood indefinitely for current or future medical
[3:57:43.020 --> 3:57:47.660]  research a practice that has been the subject of legal challenge in minnesota we had those people
[3:57:47.660 --> 3:57:52.860]  on fighting it last year five dots of blood are collected on paper now they take ampules out of the
[3:57:52.860 --> 3:57:56.780]  baby seal folks not just the five dots and are collected on paper for screening and then stored
[3:57:56.780 --> 3:58:00.460]  under the health department's policy the samples can be used for medical community for things like
[3:58:00.460 --> 3:58:05.100]  cancer research burnt effect studies and calibration of lab equipment now they're using it for a dna
[3:58:05.100 --> 3:58:11.020]  database on units popping up with insurance refusing people coverage we are out of time ladies and
