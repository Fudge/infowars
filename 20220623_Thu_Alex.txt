[00:00.000 --> 00:29.000]  This is a tale about an unprejudiced heart and how it changed our value forever.
[00:29.000 --> 00:32.000]  Despite the purpose, how much do I owe you?
[00:32.000 --> 00:35.000]  It's a runt, Harry. Just a worthless little runt.
[00:49.000 --> 00:53.000]  The pig and the farmer regarded each other.
[00:53.000 --> 00:57.000]  And for a fleeting moment, something passed between them.
[00:57.000 --> 01:01.000]  Bill Gates wants you dead. He's on record.
[01:01.000 --> 01:08.000]  We've been militarily targeted by the globalists for a long, long, long, long time.
[01:15.000 --> 01:20.000]  I'm not into bestiality, but I do like Mr. Ed, and he looks like Mr. Ed.
[01:20.000 --> 01:28.000]  They're making shit up. They keep saying I'm taking horse dewormer. I literally got it from a doctor.
[01:28.000 --> 01:30.000]  Hey, hey. Hi, guys. How you doing?
[01:30.000 --> 01:33.000]  Hi, Dr. Fauci.
[01:33.000 --> 01:35.000]  Something is going on.
[01:35.000 --> 01:37.000]  You've got to eat bugs or worms.
[01:37.000 --> 01:38.000]  You know why?
[01:38.000 --> 01:39.000]  Because Bill told you to.
[01:39.000 --> 01:41.000]  A wonderful source of cheap protein.
[01:41.000 --> 01:42.000]  That's a bad mood, man.
[01:42.000 --> 01:44.000]  Bill Gates, that piece of garbage.
[01:44.000 --> 01:47.000]  No, the stuff he's done in is the people who make me want to throw up.
[01:47.000 --> 01:49.000]  Hello. I'm Bill Gates.
[01:49.000 --> 01:53.000]  When I was growing up, my parents were always involved in Planned Parenthood.
[01:53.000 --> 01:57.000]  An issue that really grabbed me as urgent were issues related to population.
[01:57.000 --> 02:00.000]  I'm sick of being social engineer. It's not funny.
[02:00.000 --> 02:06.000]  And we're taking things that are genetically modified organisms, and we're injecting them in little kids' arms.
[02:06.000 --> 02:08.000]  We just shoot them right into the vein.
[02:08.000 --> 02:10.000]  A bunch of criminals coming down on us.
[02:10.000 --> 02:15.000]  Bill's such a fan of farmland. He's now the biggest owner of farmland in America.
[02:15.000 --> 02:20.000]  The Great Reset is the brainchild of a guy called Klaus Schwab.
[02:20.000 --> 02:23.000]  He's a totalitarian cat.
[02:23.000 --> 02:45.000]  It is I, Klaus, leading the Great Reset, our plan, to make you eat zippons and happily own the nothing.
[02:53.000 --> 03:03.000]  Take him by the hand. Make him understand. Make him understand.
[03:03.000 --> 03:13.000]  The world on you depends on a life you'll never end. God, I love your man.
[03:13.000 --> 03:23.000]  It's Thursday, June 23, 2022, on host Alex Jones. And man, we have broadcast lined up for you today.
[03:23.000 --> 03:29.000]  I'm going to tell you all about it. We come back in the next segment and join a lot of the hundreds of radio stations that carry this broadcast.
[03:29.000 --> 03:35.000]  But I just want to thank all of you watching on InfoWars.com, forward slash show, and of course Band-Aid video.
[03:35.000 --> 03:40.000]  And I encourage you to remember, this is a participation sport. This is not a spectator sport.
[03:40.000 --> 03:44.000]  All of the enemy's plans rest on keeping the public in the dark.
[03:44.000 --> 03:51.000]  So when you spread the word and share the live links on your email, your text message, word of mouth, it overrides their tyranny and does an incredible job.
[03:51.000 --> 03:56.000]  And we are so close to defeating them. So they are unveiling their whole plan.
[03:56.000 --> 04:08.000]  They've got human animal cloning, big news, big war in Russia, Ukraine, energy news, massive Great Reset news, incredibly important Second Amendment news.
[04:08.000 --> 04:12.000]  There is just so much to cover today. It is truly massive.
[04:12.000 --> 04:18.000]  Roe v. Wade, Supreme Court ruling imminent. Supreme Court just overturned gun control in New York.
[04:18.000 --> 04:23.000]  Massively positive ruling. The best we've seen in modern times from the Supreme Court.
[04:23.000 --> 04:26.000]  So that's cause for celebration.
[04:26.000 --> 04:31.000]  There is just so much to cover here today. The good, the bad, and the ugly.
[04:31.000 --> 04:38.000]  The U.N. says they need billions of dollars to feed starving people because of the supply chain breakdowns caused by the lockdowns and inflation.
[04:38.000 --> 04:45.000]  It's all coming up today on this Thursday. I broadcast your call, special guest, and a lot more.
[04:45.000 --> 04:53.000]  Remember, you're not supposed to be watching this show. The enemy hates it for a reason because we've got the answers, ladies and gentlemen, to defeat the New World Order.
[04:53.000 --> 05:01.000]  Stay with us, infowards.com, tomorrow's news today.
[05:24.000 --> 05:32.000]  It's now out in the open. Klaus Schwab said last week that they rule the Earth, the Bilderberg group founded Davos Group.
[05:32.000 --> 05:38.000]  So now the fight's out in the open. They're making their move because they know they're behind schedule.
[05:38.000 --> 05:41.000]  We're going to win this thing. God's watching the children counting on us.
[05:41.000 --> 05:49.000]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and your financial support because without you, infowards would not be here.
[05:49.000 --> 05:55.000]  I want you to really internalize the fact that you are the info war and you are the reason humanity has a fighting chance.
[05:55.000 --> 06:20.000]  So I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done and ask you now to redouble your efforts.
[06:26.000 --> 06:40.000]  Make no mistake, we're in a battle for the future. The future of humanity itself and info wars is the tip of the tip of the spear in the danger zone.
[06:40.000 --> 06:50.000]  And there's not any place I'd rather be than right here talking to millions of you amazing people of a race, color and creed. It is beautiful.
[06:50.000 --> 07:03.000]  And we welcome you all and we salute you again for your spirit and your determination for freedom and liberty together with God's spirit.
[07:03.000 --> 07:14.000]  We are indomitable. We are invincible. We are dauntless. We are victory.
[07:14.000 --> 07:20.000]  All right, my friends, it is incredible what's happening.
[07:20.000 --> 07:35.000]  We are witnessing the concerted attack of the globalist to collapse the world economy, smash nation states, dissolve borders, annihilate the cities, implode the currency, launch massive crime.
[07:35.000 --> 07:44.000]  I mean, this is it. And all of it hinges on the public not being aware of who's behind it and what their in game is.
[07:44.000 --> 07:50.000]  But it's a paradox. Simultaneously, they're in the news saying ban beef.
[07:50.000 --> 07:55.000]  If we can't ban cars, ban gas stations, that's happening in California.
[07:55.000 --> 08:02.000]  It's all in the stacks. Simultaneously, they say pedophilia is good, but oh, there are no pedophiles.
[08:02.000 --> 08:06.000]  World government's here, but nobody wants world government.
[08:06.000 --> 08:15.000]  Because as they run their cult and build their organizations and their operations and collapse society and take it over enriching themselves and impoverishing us so they can control us,
[08:15.000 --> 08:22.000]  they simultaneously gaslight us and say, nobody's imploding the border. There's no caravans coming.
[08:22.000 --> 08:31.000]  There's no inflation. There's no, well, drag queen story time is a good thing. Oh, so they're convicted pedophiles.
[08:31.000 --> 08:38.000]  And it goes on and on and on. When the left occupies capitals and breaks things, it's stunning and brave.
[08:38.000 --> 08:48.000]  But when a few thousand people out of a million do it, the DC capital, it's insurrection.
[08:48.000 --> 08:55.000]  We are not on the edge of the precipice anymore of sliding into the new world order.
[08:55.000 --> 09:04.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are free fall. And I'll quote that famous Beatles song, Helter Skelter.
[09:04.000 --> 09:10.000]  I'm coming down fast, but I'm miles above you.
[09:10.000 --> 09:16.000]  Think about that. The system wants to implode things to control us.
[09:16.000 --> 09:21.000]  That's what tyrants always do. That's their instinct, but it always ends up bringing them down.
[09:21.000 --> 09:25.000]  So here's what we're going to be covering today.
[09:25.000 --> 09:30.000]  We're going to be opening the phones up as well.
[09:30.000 --> 09:38.000]  But we have the designed great reset global collapse stack that is massive and that is unbelievably critical.
[09:38.000 --> 09:48.000]  With the Fed chairman admitting that inflation was not caused by the Russia invasion and it was caused by monetary policy and spending.
[09:48.000 --> 09:55.000]  And we have the U.N. saying the global food crisis is going to kill millions and millions of people, which they themselves engineered.
[09:55.000 --> 09:59.000]  And we have the announcements again of banning me from shutting off the gas.
[09:59.000 --> 10:02.000]  Biden admitting it's part of a transition.
[10:02.000 --> 10:09.000]  His mother said you got to go through pain first before you have something better, but they're not giving us anything to transition to.
[10:09.000 --> 10:11.000]  We got that stat.
[10:11.000 --> 10:15.000]  Then we've got this incredible stack that really is our top story.
[10:15.000 --> 10:20.000]  The U.N. is preparing a new global pandemic announcement.
[10:20.000 --> 10:31.000]  Biden said on Monday that a new pandemic is coming and that it's imminent and Jiminy Crickets.
[10:31.000 --> 10:33.000]  Here it is.
[10:33.000 --> 10:42.000]  WHO AP reports considers declaring monkeypox a global health emergency with the mask, the lockdowns and everything.
[10:42.000 --> 10:55.000]  The accoutrement, the fastoonage that comes with it.
[10:55.000 --> 10:57.000]  Oh, and they've got the first polio outbreak.
[10:57.000 --> 11:02.000]  Oh, of course in the U.K. so that they want an emergency for that.
[11:02.000 --> 11:12.000]  Right as they announced, toddlers ages six months and up to be given the deadly mRNA gene takeover nanotech poison.
[11:12.000 --> 11:14.000]  But folks are fighting back against it.
[11:14.000 --> 11:16.000]  We've got so much on that front.
[11:16.000 --> 11:27.000]  A major, major British Medical Journal study out that is so bombshell that the word bombshell is overused.
[11:27.000 --> 11:33.000]  This is bomb shell. This is hydrogen bomb big.
[11:33.000 --> 11:35.000]  Collating all the data our guests have already.
[11:35.000 --> 11:44.000]  We've had top statisticians on, top scientists, top doctors, insurance company executives, Wall Street executives, all telling you the same damn thing.
[11:44.000 --> 11:53.000]  But now it's the British Medical Journal saying the shots kill way more people and maim way more people than they protect.
[11:53.000 --> 12:00.000]  Even with the Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca and J&J fake data and it's come out in court, those were fake studies.
[12:00.000 --> 12:18.000]  So with fake data, with their data claiming it's good and 30% efficacy and all this other crap, they admit it is dozens of times more dangerous to take the shot than for any benefit you might get.
[12:18.000 --> 12:24.000]  And when you take out the fake data, it's really bad.
[12:24.000 --> 12:30.000]  So that alone is unbelievable.
[12:30.000 --> 12:47.000]  And that's only, I've got 30 something articles right here just on the COVID tyranny takeover that's about to go into high gear again.
[12:47.000 --> 12:52.000]  That's two of the stacks. We got the global reset. We got the COVID next phase of the tyranny.
[12:52.000 --> 13:03.000]  And then we've got genetically edited humans, cows, you name it, FDA approved first CRISPR edited mammals.
[13:03.000 --> 13:09.000]  And that ties into a bunch of other AI news and the transhumanist revolution we're going to be heading.
[13:09.000 --> 13:21.000]  And then we move on over here. Germany elevates risk to highest level of national gas emergency plan in the war with Russia.
[13:21.000 --> 13:25.000]  We've got the big abortion ruling that's set to come out in the left running around terrorizing everybody.
[13:25.000 --> 13:32.000]  They have a huge second amendment ruling by the Supreme Court that's unprecedented.
[13:32.000 --> 13:43.000]  That's pro-second amendment. And I also want to spend some time on this because I didn't come out and say Uvaldi might be a false flag or an inside job,
[13:43.000 --> 13:51.000]  because I hadn't seen the evidence of it and I wanted to believe in Texas law enforcement.
[13:51.000 --> 13:57.000]  And this is one of the times where Alex Jones is not always right. Alex Jones was right. He's not always right.
[13:57.000 --> 14:02.000]  I apologized a few weeks ago before I left town on a vacation, a workcation.
[14:02.000 --> 14:12.000]  And I said, I was wrong. Well, now we have some of the surveillance footage.
[14:12.000 --> 14:18.000]  Now we have the statements. Now we have the 77 minutes stand down. And now we know we were lied to.
[14:18.000 --> 14:23.000]  And even the head of the DPS says it is egregious, the cover up that's ongoing.
[14:23.000 --> 14:29.000]  So you can say whatever you want about Uvaldi because they're covering it up and we don't know and none of it makes sense.
[14:29.000 --> 14:36.000]  And you look at the time we are in this country and the left that I predicted false flags.
[14:36.000 --> 14:42.000]  So I will say that Uvaldi is an open case.
[14:42.000 --> 14:48.000]  And just like I said, Jesse Smollett didn't add up. It doesn't add up.
[14:48.000 --> 14:55.000]  Now, what are they covering up? We're not sure. But if you believe police stood down for 77 minutes, I got an Easter Bunny.
[14:55.000 --> 14:59.000]  I'm ready to sell you.
[14:59.000 --> 15:05.000]  I mean, this is sick. And you've got McConaughey's their new deep state darling Bill Clinton 2.0.
[15:05.000 --> 15:12.000]  And now they're maneuvering and all and where they chose it at the end of school and they're going to demolish the school and all of it.
[15:12.000 --> 15:18.000]  I will be going to Uvaldi to investigate. They don't want us investigating. They don't want us looking into it.
[15:18.000 --> 15:25.000]  I'm going to Uvaldi very, very soon and I'm going to talk to locals and I'm just going to put it all out.
[15:25.000 --> 15:33.000]  Just what they say. I'm going to go there and I'm going to announce when I'm coming and we'll have a rally point for the truth.
[15:33.000 --> 15:36.000]  And people can just come and talk and they'll be able to be heard.
[15:36.000 --> 15:42.000]  I'm not going to give my commentary really. I'm just going to hear from them because we've been hearing from the locals.
[15:42.000 --> 15:49.000]  And let me tell you, it ain't good, folks. Looks like Operation Northwood's to me.
[15:49.000 --> 15:53.000]  You can't stop them.
[15:53.000 --> 16:07.000]  We'll be right back.

[23:12.000 --> 23:16.000]  X2 by itself, very close to selling out, 40% off.
[23:16.000 --> 23:24.000]  And they held back more for auto-ship because if you sign up for auto-ship on your next order, you don't just get 10% off.
[23:24.000 --> 23:30.000]  They hold back items that are going to sell out just so you get fulfilled.
[23:30.000 --> 23:34.000]  And they did the accounting and they held back 1,100 bottles.
[23:34.000 --> 23:46.000]  Vitamin mineral fusions have been sold out for six months, reportedly going to be back in July, but with supply chain breakdowns, who knows, but that's what we've got at Forecast.
[23:46.000 --> 23:48.000]  50,000 canisters of it that will help fund the operation.
[23:48.000 --> 23:53.000]  It is so tasty and so good and all the vitamins, all the minerals, everything you need.
[23:53.000 --> 23:56.000]  1,124 bottles were found yesterday.
[23:56.000 --> 23:59.000]  They were in the warehouse, but I had a full inventory done.
[23:59.000 --> 24:04.000]  And they're like, yeah, we held back more from auto-ship than was needed.
[24:04.000 --> 24:14.000]  And so we have 1,100 bottles of it available in a flash sale at infowarstore.com or call toll-free, triple-aid, 253-3139.

[24:18.000 --> 24:29.000]  Separately, during the break I heard a radio ad, TV viewers didn't see it, but radio listeners heard it, for water filtration at PrepareToDay.com.
[24:29.000 --> 24:35.000]  Highest quality, highest rated water filtration at half the price of leading competitors that are just as good.

[24:40.000 --> 24:42.000]  There's like three that are highest rated.
[24:42.000 --> 24:44.000]  You're selling one at half the price.
[24:44.000 --> 24:48.000]  And that's because our sponsors are smart, they're the folks that own my Patreon.

[25:24.000 --> 25:33.000]  I told you 30 plus months ago they'd have worldwide food crises and shortages and attacks on the food supply because it's their battle plan.
[25:33.000 --> 25:35.000]  And I make it my life to stay their battle plan.

[26:07.000 --> 26:14.000]  All available at infowarstore.com and that sale must end today because two of the items are about to sell out.
[26:14.000 --> 26:21.000]  So guaranteed that sale will be down tomorrow because we don't sell something we don't have in stock.
[26:21.000 --> 26:25.000]  All right, let's just stop right there.
[26:25.000 --> 26:27.000]  I want to break in three minutes.
[26:27.000 --> 26:35.000]  And I'm really trying to summon my greatest oratory capacity
[26:35.000 --> 26:43.000]  to properly address you, not just with the facts, but with what we face.
[26:43.000 --> 26:48.000]  And I'm telling you, I'm a big boy.
[26:48.000 --> 26:55.000]  And every fleshly instinct I've got is to shut this down and disappear now.
[26:55.000 --> 26:57.000]  But I know that's the flesh.
[26:57.000 --> 26:59.000]  That's an animal that's fearful.
[26:59.000 --> 27:04.000]  Not the spirit that God gave me that is a spirit of overcoming and a spirit of power.
[27:04.000 --> 27:10.000]  The spirit says, stay on air, fight to the end, never back off, never give in.
[27:10.000 --> 27:25.000]  And so my message to you is not just one of temporal analysis and numbers which are horrible, devastating, frightening, horrifying, demoralizing.
[27:25.000 --> 27:30.000]  But the left is going to get burned way worse than we are because we're at least partially prepared.
[27:30.000 --> 27:35.000]  You know what's coming and knowing what's coming and understanding what's coming is half the battle.
[27:35.000 --> 27:38.000]  I'm getting chills right now, literally.
[27:38.000 --> 27:41.000]  So I tried to stop this.
[27:41.000 --> 27:42.000]  You tried to stop this.
[27:42.000 --> 27:44.000]  We worked so hard to try to stop this.
[27:44.000 --> 27:46.000]  This ain't getting stopped.
[27:46.000 --> 27:49.000]  It's like being in a parking lot and some crazy schizophrenic comes up.
[27:49.000 --> 27:56.000]  I've had it happen a couple of times and they pull a knife out and they won't leave you alone and you're like, damn it.
[27:56.000 --> 28:00.000]  I got to open a can of whoop ass and hurt this son of a bitch real bad.
[28:00.000 --> 28:02.000]  And you do what you got to do.
[28:02.000 --> 28:08.000]  And you're just at that point when you really kick somebody's ass, it's not thinking about kicking their ass.
[28:08.000 --> 28:11.000]  It's about you going to do it.
[28:11.000 --> 28:18.000]  Well, we're not going to beat anybody's ass here, but I'm saying politically, we didn't ask for this.
[28:18.000 --> 28:20.000]  We didn't do this.
[28:20.000 --> 28:25.000]  We're in this and we're just going to have to decide to do it.
[28:25.000 --> 28:33.000]  And to culturally and spiritually and economically break with these people and just get ready.
[28:33.000 --> 28:44.000]  Because baby, baby, baby, baby, let me tell you, you better get your butts ready with God right now.
[28:44.000 --> 28:48.000]  Because there's no way this gets reversed now.
[28:48.000 --> 28:51.000]  There's no way sweetheart.
[28:51.000 --> 28:53.000]  We turn this around.
[28:53.000 --> 28:55.000]  Medicate how bad it's going to get.
[28:55.000 --> 29:24.000]  We're in it now. Stay with us.
[29:25.000 --> 29:31.000]  The immune support formula is incredible by itself.

[30:59.000 --> 31:01.000]  That's just Susan's new film.
[31:01.000 --> 31:07.000]  2000 mules is the most important documentary in modern times because it proves how the deep state
[31:07.000 --> 31:10.000]  stole the 2020 election and how they're planning to steal future elections
[31:10.000 --> 31:13.000]  and complete our journey to basically being like Venezuela.
[31:13.000 --> 31:15.000]  Now it's great that it's online.

[32:35.000 --> 32:40.000]  everything's happening is one of the most important things you can make is to have high quality, storeable food,
[32:40.000 --> 32:42.000]  water filtration, air filtration and more.
[32:42.000 --> 32:45.000]  And it's not just those items, it's hundreds of other high quality,

[32:53.000 --> 32:56.000]  I would not procrastinate, ladies and gentlemen, one of the most important things you can do
[32:56.000 --> 33:11.000]  is get ahead of inflation now because inflation is just beginning.
[33:11.000 --> 33:26.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance, live from Austin, Texas.
[33:26.000 --> 33:34.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:34.000 --> 33:37.000]  Alright, let's cut to the chase here.
[33:37.000 --> 33:42.000]  Let's do it this way. Let's just look at these headlines first and I'll play these clips.
[33:42.000 --> 33:48.000]  Barons reports global food crisis will kill millions by disease.
[33:48.000 --> 33:53.000]  Health executive warrants, the very people that orchestrated it.
[33:53.000 --> 33:58.000]  Biden economic advisor asserts that more government spending will solve inflation,
[33:58.000 --> 34:05.000]  which a five-year-old that knows economy or economics would understand is the opposite.
[34:05.000 --> 34:09.000]  By saying throwing more dry wood on a fire that's already going,
[34:09.000 --> 34:13.000]  will make the fire go out.
[34:13.000 --> 34:17.000]  Or filling your gas tank up will make the car run out of gas.
[34:17.000 --> 34:22.000]  Or shooting yourself in the head will be good for you.
[34:22.000 --> 34:26.000]  And we have the Fed chairman throwing Biden on the bus
[34:26.000 --> 34:29.000]  admitting that it wasn't Putin that caused the inflation.
[34:29.000 --> 34:31.000]  What is that really all about?
[34:31.000 --> 34:33.000]  That's rats leaving the sinking ship.
[34:33.000 --> 34:36.000]  And then these type of headlines.
[34:36.000 --> 34:38.000]  Treating beef like coal.
[34:38.000 --> 34:41.000]  This is the Rothschild publication, the Economist.
[34:41.000 --> 34:45.000]  Treating beef like coal would make a big dent in greenhouse gas emissions.
[34:45.000 --> 34:48.000]  Yes, can't have those cows farting.
[34:48.000 --> 34:52.000]  A pound of grasshoppers is three times as nutritious as a pound of beef.
[34:52.000 --> 34:56.000]  That's what the left's putting out. Told you that was coming.
[34:56.000 --> 34:58.000]  And it goes on from there.
[34:58.000 --> 35:02.000]  Biden vows to end fossil fuels again and take cars off the road.
[35:02.000 --> 35:05.000]  Got that clip.
[35:05.000 --> 35:09.000]  That's just some of the economic news we're going to be getting to.
[35:09.000 --> 35:11.000]  But the bottom line is this.
[35:11.000 --> 35:16.000]  This is organized economic warfare against me, against you, against our families.
[35:16.000 --> 35:18.000]  It doesn't matter what color you are.
[35:18.000 --> 35:20.000]  It doesn't matter what your sexual preference is.
[35:20.000 --> 35:22.000]  It doesn't matter where you live.
[35:22.000 --> 35:24.000]  It's a new world order.
[35:24.000 --> 35:31.000]  It's a big club, as Carlin said, and we ain't it.
[35:31.000 --> 35:34.000]  And again, that's why I go back to Biden.
[35:34.000 --> 35:38.000]  You have the Federal Reserve blaming Biden and Biden blaming the Federal Reserve.
[35:38.000 --> 35:42.000]  That's because the public thinks the Federal Reserve is in power or that Biden's in power
[35:42.000 --> 35:46.000]  when they're all just puppets of the same big central private banks.
[35:46.000 --> 35:50.000]  And so they're now blaming each other, which is part of the plan,
[35:50.000 --> 35:55.000]  instead of blaming those on top of them that ran these policies and brought in the Great Reset.
[35:55.000 --> 36:03.000]  Yeah, they're functionaries, yeah, they're high-level gophers, but they're only executives for the owners.
[36:03.000 --> 36:08.000]  The owners of the system that are eugenicists that want to depopulate you and your family.
[36:08.000 --> 36:16.000]  So here is Biden being reversed by the head of the Federal Reserve, Powell,
[36:16.000 --> 36:26.000]  saying no inflation was high before, certainly before the war in Ukraine broke out,
[36:26.000 --> 36:28.000]  which is a true statement. Here it is.
[36:28.000 --> 36:31.000]  Given how inflation has escalated over the past 18 months,
[36:31.000 --> 36:35.000]  would you say that the war in Ukraine is the primary driver of inflation in America?
[36:35.000 --> 36:41.000]  No, inflation was high before, certainly before the war in Ukraine broke out.
[36:41.000 --> 36:46.000]  We also have, we have the clips, would you like me to bore you with them?
[36:46.000 --> 36:48.000]  I should show you the headlines.
[36:48.000 --> 36:51.000]  Where the Biden administration is saying inflation is coming down,
[36:51.000 --> 36:54.000]  first they told you a year and a half ago there was inflation,
[36:54.000 --> 36:57.000]  then they said there was small inflation, then it was good.
[36:57.000 --> 37:02.000]  And now they say there's high inflation, but it's the American people's fault
[37:02.000 --> 37:06.000]  and fossil fuels' fault, which they've cut off, causing much of the inflation.
[37:06.000 --> 37:12.000]  That's what exacerbated this, not just over printing of money, but cutting energy off,
[37:12.000 --> 37:17.000]  which then drove up the price of the very fundamental driver of the economy.
[37:17.000 --> 37:23.000]  Here's the Fed chairman saying what we're looking for is a compelling evidence
[37:23.000 --> 37:28.000]  that inflation is coming down and we don't have that.
[37:28.000 --> 37:33.000]  Translated in a coming down baby, it's going up.
[37:33.000 --> 37:36.000]  Well, there are positive signs that price is stabilizing.
[37:36.000 --> 37:44.000]  So in terms of price is stabilizing, what we're looking for is compelling evidence
[37:44.000 --> 37:46.000]  that inflation is coming down and we don't have that.
[37:46.000 --> 37:51.000]  So nothing I could point to says that we have that.
[37:51.000 --> 37:56.000]  So, now let's go to a clip with emergency services all over the U.S.,
[37:56.000 --> 38:02.000]  fire departments, police departments don't have money to respond to many calls
[38:02.000 --> 38:05.000]  because they don't have it in their budget for gasoline.
[38:05.000 --> 38:07.000]  That equals Road Warrior.
[38:07.000 --> 38:11.000]  That equals collapse of society, Mad Max beyond Thunderdome.
[38:11.000 --> 38:12.000]  Here it is.
[38:12.000 --> 38:16.000]  What happens when important emergency services that are already spread thin
[38:16.000 --> 38:20.000]  from a couple years of the pandemic can't even afford to fill up their tanks,
[38:20.000 --> 38:22.000]  becoming a bigger problem in some parts of the country,
[38:22.000 --> 38:27.000]  forcing some fire departments and EMS services to limit the kinds of calls they can respond to.
[38:27.000 --> 38:31.000]  The high cost of fuel isn't just making your commute more expensive.
[38:31.000 --> 38:36.000]  It's also forcing emergency responders in smaller communities to cut costs.
[38:36.000 --> 38:39.000]  For some, it means not responding to non-emergency calls,
[38:39.000 --> 38:44.000]  for others cutting back on patrols, building inspections, and training courses for staff.
[38:44.000 --> 38:50.000]  Today, the average cost of a gallon of regular gas in the U.S. at a whopping $5.
[38:50.000 --> 38:53.000]  That price tag expected to climb further in the summer months.
[38:53.000 --> 38:59.000]  The surge impacting larger emergency response departments too, but not in the same way.
[38:59.000 --> 39:03.000]  I spoke with departments across the country who told me they're already having to
[39:03.000 --> 39:07.000]  or will have to make big sacrifices to offset the cost of gas.
[39:07.000 --> 39:11.000]  We've never seen costs like this since I've been sheriff.
[39:11.000 --> 39:15.000]  We're at 100% usage of our allotted fuel budget for this budget year already.
[39:15.000 --> 39:19.000]  I'm worried about the state of emergency response agencies throughout the nation.
[39:19.000 --> 39:22.000]  A lot of things we're doing today is we call it No Dry Friday.
[39:22.000 --> 39:27.000]  So the crews aren't really allowed to leave the station unless it's an emergency.
[39:27.000 --> 39:32.000]  We're also trying to reduce the number of vehicles that we send on an emergency response.
[39:32.000 --> 39:37.000]  Decrease spending, purchasing new equipment, or possibly some of our maintenance items for the year.
[39:37.000 --> 39:42.000]  Those pre-disaster or pre-emergency activities that are labeled as non-emergency.
[39:42.000 --> 39:51.000]  We're predicting a minimum of an $800,000 to $1 million countywide fleet vehicle increase in the fuel costs.
[39:51.000 --> 39:54.000]  And that cost is going to be astronomical.
[39:54.000 --> 39:58.000]  So this has all been laid out by the World Economic Forum and the Globalists
[39:58.000 --> 40:04.000]  where they said we're going to cut the energy off and have climate lockdowns because there won't be energy.
[40:04.000 --> 40:06.000]  They're coming after everything.
[40:06.000 --> 40:17.000]  And then MSNBC comes out and says calm down and back off and stop complaining about high gas prices.
[40:17.000 --> 40:22.000]  So they're just rubbing it in and saying, and then Biden says, I have the clip.
[40:22.000 --> 40:27.000]  Biden said yesterday, well, his mom talked about having to go through pain for things got better.
[40:27.000 --> 40:31.000]  This is a transition. It's on purpose.
[40:31.000 --> 40:36.000]  There's all these headlines about Biden pledges to lower gas prices without increasing output.
[40:36.000 --> 40:40.000]  He shuts off the output.
[40:40.000 --> 40:42.000]  Russia massively increases output.
[40:42.000 --> 40:44.000]  Venezuela does.
[40:44.000 --> 40:48.000]  China is going to build all the solar panels and electric car batteries.
[40:48.000 --> 40:51.000]  It's all designed as economic war.
[40:51.000 --> 40:53.000]  The Globalists doing it.
[40:53.000 --> 40:56.000]  They have deals with Russia. They have deals with China.
[40:56.000 --> 40:58.000]  This is a giant screw job.
[40:58.000 --> 41:04.000]  And while you hear about Russia is the enemy of the New World Order, it's in bed with all of it, folks.
[41:04.000 --> 41:06.000]  Unbelievable.
[41:06.000 --> 41:08.000]  So here it is, calm down and back off.
[41:08.000 --> 41:09.000]  Here it is.
[41:09.000 --> 41:11.000]  Where we are right now?
[41:11.000 --> 41:17.000]  You know, I'm just going to say this and if I get banged for it, I don't care.
[41:17.000 --> 41:24.000]  There is a great deal of Americans where it is uncomfortable that they're spending more, but they are not going to go under.
[41:24.000 --> 41:34.000]  You know, you got to stop complaining when there's so many people who literally the inflation rate means they may only have two meals instead of three.
[41:34.000 --> 41:39.000]  There are Americans who did extremely well in the last two years in the market.
[41:39.000 --> 41:41.000]  You still have your job.
[41:41.000 --> 41:47.000]  It's costing you more for gas, but guess what? You're still going to take that holiday, that Fourth of July vacation, you can still eat out.
[41:47.000 --> 41:59.000]  So I'm going to need you to calm down and back off because it feeds into this fear and then this fear feeds into people making decisions that creates the very thing that they're fearful of.
[41:59.000 --> 42:05.000]  So they implement the policies of killing hundreds of thousands of drilling permits.
[42:05.000 --> 42:07.000]  They kill drilling in Alaska.
[42:07.000 --> 42:12.000]  They kill new oil coming in with the Keystone pipeline out of Canada.
[42:12.000 --> 42:14.000]  They kill Gulf of Mexico drilling.
[42:14.000 --> 42:19.000]  They put regulations on the coal plants and shut the rest of them down.
[42:19.000 --> 42:26.000]  And then we have rolling blackouts and all this and they go, hey, stop complaining back off.
[42:26.000 --> 42:28.000]  This is a transition.
[42:28.000 --> 42:31.000]  Get used to it.
[42:31.000 --> 42:32.000]  You're being broken.
[42:32.000 --> 42:33.000]  You're being made poor.
[42:33.000 --> 42:36.000]  You have economic warfare being waged against you and your family.
[42:36.000 --> 42:37.000]  All right.
[42:37.000 --> 42:40.000]  That's a lot of the economic news only covered a fraction of it.
[42:40.000 --> 42:50.000]  I got to hit the big Second Amendment ruling in that fight and what's happening with the Roe v. Wade about to be reportedly overturned.
[42:50.000 --> 42:55.000]  And then we'll hit the huge news on the new rollout of new lockdowns the UN has announced.
[42:55.000 --> 42:56.000]  It's here.
[42:56.000 --> 42:59.000]  So we'll tell you about that next hour.
[42:59.000 --> 43:07.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, in the last 30 months, we've witnessed the globalists hit humanity and hit humanity extremely hard.
[43:07.000 --> 43:16.000]  It is beyond critical that everyone listening to the sound of my voice protect yourselves and your families to the greatest extent possible.
[43:16.000 --> 43:18.000]  And these two new sales do that.
[43:18.000 --> 43:23.000]  We have the ultimate immune support, 60% off when you get these four items together.
[43:23.000 --> 43:27.000]  The immune support, X2, D3 gummies and multivitamin.
[43:27.000 --> 43:31.000]  The immune support formula is incredible by itself.
[43:31.000 --> 43:33.000]  These other three together, it is amazing.
[43:33.000 --> 43:34.000]  60% off.
[43:34.000 --> 43:40.000]  Then the Trafecta immune support, 50% off on immune support, X2 and D3 gummies.

[43:54.000 --> 43:59.000]  It's 40% off back in stock, but get four of the products together for 60% off.
[43:59.000 --> 44:05.000]  So when I first started taking survival shield, basically I was 275 pounds overweight.
[44:05.000 --> 44:07.000]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[44:07.000 --> 44:12.000]  I was barely holding on to a job and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[44:12.000 --> 44:15.000]  So the first one I got was the original survival shield, the X1.
[44:15.000 --> 44:16.000]  And it worked pretty good.
[44:16.000 --> 44:18.000]  And then shortly thereafter, you came out with that.
[44:18.000 --> 44:21.000]  You had, you know, with a deep breath and sourced, you know, and I got really excited about that.
[44:21.000 --> 44:22.000]  So I took it.
[44:22.000 --> 44:28.000]  And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[44:28.000 --> 44:31.000]  You know, I could think again, I could connect with people again.
[44:31.000 --> 44:38.000]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[44:38.000 --> 44:40.000]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[44:40.000 --> 44:44.000]  The one I like recently is knockout literally like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[44:44.000 --> 44:45.000]  It's amazing. It works.
[44:45.000 --> 44:48.000]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean.
[44:48.000 --> 44:51.000]  We have to break free of the globalist system.
[44:51.000 --> 44:55.000]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[44:55.000 --> 44:56.000]  Beautifully said, brother.
[44:56.000 --> 45:25.000]  Thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[45:26.000 --> 45:27.000]  Thank you.
[45:56.000 --> 46:06.000]  At this point, best case scenario is a few years of hard times for us all.
[46:06.000 --> 46:10.000]  And if we don't turn it around soon, then it will only get worse.
[46:10.000 --> 46:15.000]  But as bad as things are, we still have time to prepare.
[46:15.000 --> 46:18.000]  And that alone is something to be grateful for.
[46:18.000 --> 46:26.000]  Gravity water filter will provide you with clean, healthy water, even in the event of your taps getting shut off.
[46:26.000 --> 46:31.000]  And having your own food will save you from getting ensnared in government FEMA camps.
[46:31.000 --> 46:38.000]  And if you've already stocked up enough for your own family, you might want to consider stocking up for your neighbors.
[46:38.000 --> 46:48.000]  Some of your neighbors might not be prepared for what's coming, but you can help them by having an abundance of storable foods and water filtration.
[46:48.000 --> 46:53.000]  Whoever sews bountifully will also reap bountifully.
[46:53.000 --> 47:19.000]  Stock up now at PrepareToday.com.
[47:19.000 --> 47:23.000]  Everybody knows that the days are loaded.
[47:23.000 --> 47:28.000]  Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed.
[47:28.000 --> 47:32.000]  Everybody knows the war is over.
[47:32.000 --> 47:35.000]  Everybody knows that the gas is out.
[47:35.000 --> 47:38.000]  Your calls are coming up in the second and third hour.
[47:38.000 --> 47:42.000]  Massive amounts of news to cover.
[47:42.000 --> 47:48.000]  We're going to get into the COVID tourney and so much more as well.
[47:48.000 --> 47:52.000]  But first, we're going to hit the Supreme Court ruling on the Second Amendment.
[47:52.000 --> 48:00.000]  Then we're going to get into the Roe v. Wade imminent ruling and what that means.
[48:00.000 --> 48:02.000]  And we're going to get any better.
[48:02.000 --> 48:05.000]  Don't look for it. Be happy with what you got.
[48:05.000 --> 48:09.000]  Because the owners of this country don't want that.
[48:09.000 --> 48:11.000]  I'm talking about the real owners now.
[48:11.000 --> 48:17.000]  The real owners, the big wealthy business, and just to control things and make all the important decisions.
[48:17.000 --> 48:19.000]  Get the politicians.
[48:19.000 --> 48:23.000]  The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice.
[48:23.000 --> 48:26.000]  You don't. You have no choice.
[48:26.000 --> 48:29.000]  You have owners. They own you.
[48:29.000 --> 48:31.000]  They own everything.
[48:31.000 --> 48:33.000]  They own all the important land.
[48:33.000 --> 48:35.000]  They own and control the corporations.
[48:35.000 --> 48:38.000]  They've long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the state houses, and city halls.
[48:38.000 --> 48:40.000]  They've got the judges in their back pockets.
[48:40.000 --> 48:42.000]  And they own all the big media companies.
[48:42.000 --> 48:45.000]  So they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear.
[48:45.000 --> 48:48.000]  They got you by the balls.
[48:48.000 --> 48:52.000]  They want obedient workers, obedient workers.
[48:52.000 --> 48:56.000]  People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork.
[48:56.000 --> 49:02.000]  And just dumb enough to passively accept jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours to reduce benefits, the end of overtime,
[49:02.000 --> 49:05.000]  and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it.
[49:05.000 --> 49:09.000]  And now they're coming for your social security money.
[49:09.000 --> 49:13.000]  So they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street.
[49:13.000 --> 49:16.000]  It's a big club, and you ain't in it.
[49:16.000 --> 49:21.000]  You said recently, quote, when you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do.
[49:21.000 --> 49:23.000]  You better believe it.
[49:23.000 --> 49:25.000]  So what specifically did they do?
[49:25.000 --> 49:30.000]  If I ask them, if I need them, you know, most of the people on this stage, I've given to, just so you understand.
[49:30.000 --> 49:32.000]  A lot of money.
[49:32.000 --> 49:35.000]  You and I are not in the big club.
[49:35.000 --> 49:37.000]  The owners of this country know the truth.
[49:37.000 --> 49:42.000]  It's called the American Dream, because you have to be asleep to believe it.
[49:42.000 --> 49:44.000]  But I'll tell you what they don't want.
[49:44.000 --> 49:47.000]  They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking.
[49:47.000 --> 49:51.000]  They don't want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking.
[49:51.000 --> 49:53.000]  They're not interested in that.
[49:53.000 --> 49:54.000]  That doesn't help them.
[49:54.000 --> 49:56.000]  That's against their interest.
[49:56.000 --> 49:57.000]  That's right.
[49:57.000 --> 50:23.000]  On the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[50:23.000 --> 50:34.000]  Because everybody knows, everybody knows, everybody knows that you're a love man, baby.
[50:34.000 --> 50:39.000]  Everybody knows that you really do.
[50:39.000 --> 50:43.000]  Everybody knows that you've been faithful.
[50:43.000 --> 50:45.000]  Except a time or two.
[50:45.000 --> 51:01.000]  Like a heart taker, night or two, everybody knows you've been discreet, but there were so many people you just had to meet without your clothes.
[51:01.000 --> 51:03.000]  Everybody knows.
[51:03.000 --> 51:04.000]  Everybody knows.
[51:04.000 --> 51:07.000]  Everybody knows.
[51:07.000 --> 51:09.000]  Everybody knows.
[51:09.000 --> 51:11.000]  Everybody knows.
[51:11.000 --> 51:14.000]  Everybody knows.
[51:14.000 --> 51:16.000]  Everybody knows.
[51:16.000 --> 51:18.000]  That's how it goes.
[51:18.000 --> 51:20.000]  Because everybody knows.
[51:20.000 --> 51:25.000]  Everybody knows.
[51:25.000 --> 51:27.000]  Everybody knows.
[51:27.000 --> 51:30.000]  Everybody knows pedophiles are on the country.
[51:30.000 --> 51:33.000]  Everybody knows they're criminals.
[51:33.000 --> 51:41.000]  Everybody knows more and more the corrupt courts have taken over our lives, but there are rays of hope.
[51:41.000 --> 51:47.000]  Because we have the Bill of Rights of Constitution that don't give us our rights, but the fundamentally point it out.
[51:47.000 --> 51:51.000]  And that's the news I've got right here in front of me.
[51:51.000 --> 52:01.000]  The Supreme Court has come out today and ruled ahead of the other big rulings like Roe v. Wade that they say is imminent.
[52:01.000 --> 52:07.000]  This is NBC News and said, no, the Second Amendment says you have a right to keep and bear arms.
[52:07.000 --> 52:16.000]  And so you don't have to, in New York, go get the police chief or the sheriff to agree because you've given them contributions or whatever the case is,
[52:16.000 --> 52:19.000]  that you have a right to own a gun.
[52:19.000 --> 52:26.000]  Because you run a liquor store or you run a gas station or a convenience store or you work late at night as a record driver.
[52:26.000 --> 52:28.000]  Why do you got to wait two, three, four years?
[52:28.000 --> 52:36.000]  Maybe when you're out there at 3 a.m., hauling cars away on the highway or in dangerous areas that you can have a damn gun.
[52:36.000 --> 52:41.000]  Well, the politicians have their own bodyguards. Well, the police are armed.
[52:41.000 --> 52:46.000]  Supreme Court says Second Amendment guarantees right to carry guns in public.
[52:46.000 --> 52:52.000]  Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution provides a right to carry a gun outside the home,
[52:52.000 --> 52:56.000]  issuing a major decision on the meaning of the Second Amendment.
[52:56.000 --> 53:03.000]  The 6-3 ruling was the court's second important decision on the right to keep and bear arms.
[53:03.000 --> 53:11.000]  In a landmark 2008 decision, the court said that the first time that the amendment safeguards a person's right to possess firearms,
[53:11.000 --> 53:17.000]  the decision was limiting to keeping guns at home for self-defense. That was the D.C. case.
[53:17.000 --> 53:25.000]  The court has now taken the ruling to the next step every years of ducking the issue and applied the Second Amendment beyond the limits of homeowner's property.
[53:25.000 --> 53:33.000]  The case involves New York law that requires showing a special need to get a permit to carry a concealed handgun in public,
[53:33.000 --> 53:36.000]  which is up to the bureaucrats that decide who you have that need.
[53:36.000 --> 53:46.000]  The state bans carrying handguns openly, but it also restricts those who apply for the concealed carry.
[53:46.000 --> 53:53.000]  Everybody knows you're trying to disarm the general public while you've got bodyguards and everybody's sick of it.
[53:53.000 --> 54:00.000]  And so you send people to four of the Supreme Court justices' houses and you're going to kill them.
[54:00.000 --> 54:04.000]  And two weeks later they come out and say, we've got a right to have guns.
[54:04.000 --> 54:09.000]  Because even though they've got federal marshals out there protecting them, you don't think Clarence Thomas,
[54:09.000 --> 54:14.000]  you don't think the others that got harassed at their houses don't have a gun?
[54:14.000 --> 54:21.000]  Clarence Thomas, I guarantee you right next to his bed in a drawer, I bet my wrong arm,
[54:21.000 --> 54:28.000]  has got a.357 magnum or a Glock 9 millimeter or a shotgun.
[54:28.000 --> 54:38.000]  I'll bet you my balls that every damn one of them, including the leftists, have got a gun by their bed.
[54:38.000 --> 54:41.000]  Happy birthday, by the way, Clarence Thomas, great guy.
[54:41.000 --> 54:44.000]  So that's where we are.
[54:44.000 --> 54:47.000]  Why does one group get guns and we don't get guns?
[54:47.000 --> 54:53.000]  One crazy person goes into a school and the police stand down for 77 minutes and lie about it.
[54:53.000 --> 54:58.000]  Shame on the police in Yvaldi.
[54:58.000 --> 55:01.000]  I don't get my guns taken.
[55:01.000 --> 55:07.000]  We've got trained security that's got all the background for arm carry, amazing veterans, you name it here.
[55:07.000 --> 55:10.000]  But I've got a gun right here just in case they fail.
[55:10.000 --> 55:12.000]  And I've got a gun in my office.
[55:12.000 --> 55:17.000]  I've got a pen that's mightier than a sword, by the way, where I can write notes and I've got articles.
[55:17.000 --> 55:19.000]  A word processor.
[55:19.000 --> 55:21.000]  I'm in the Info War.
[55:21.000 --> 55:28.000]  I'm not trying to use guns for offense, but you better bet your bottom dollar that I got guns.
[55:28.000 --> 55:34.000]  And I'm not a soft target and I'm not rolling over to you bullies and you leftist and you communist criminals.
[55:34.000 --> 55:39.000]  Oh, you're all for gun control for us, but not for you.
[55:39.000 --> 55:49.000]  So we've got all that news and I've got more I'm going to say on Yvaldi next hour.
[55:49.000 --> 55:55.000]  And when it's imminent with the Supreme Court ruling, here's a little compilation of some of the left flipping out.
[55:55.000 --> 56:04.000]  And what they're saying about shutting down the country if they're not allowed to kill babies in the third trimester.
[56:04.000 --> 56:09.600]  Regulate ejaculations, regulating ejaculations.
[56:09.600 --> 56:33.600]  Women must decide their fate, not the judge, not the state, women must decide their fate.
[56:33.600 --> 56:50.600]  That we, the man's legal nationwide abortion. If they may go forward with this draft and they overturn Roe, they will make clear they are illegitimate.
[56:50.600 --> 57:12.600]  And everyone with the heart for justice, everyone who loves women, who loves girls, who cares about LGBTQ siblings, who cares about all of humanity, then they need to be with us, they need to stand up, they need to rise up.
[57:12.600 --> 57:26.600]  There's a law taking over a major capital, this is called stunning and brave and not an insurrection.
[57:26.600 --> 57:43.600]  They're already doing that with a great reset, they're already doing that with their whole new world order. Pro-choice activists covered in fake blood deliver baby dolls to Amy Coney Barrett's home with fake blood dripping down their legs. What a bunch of freakazoid, depopulationist idiots.
[57:43.600 --> 58:09.600]  Second hour, your phone calls and more. Straight ahead.
[58:09.600 --> 58:14.600]  And it's the same thing with our immune system. God helps those who help themselves.

[59:23.600 --> 59:24.600]  They have designed this.

[59:48.600 --> 1:00:04.600]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:00:04.600 --> 1:00:15.600]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe you got one.
[1:00:15.600 --> 1:00:44.600]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:44.600 --> 1:00:55.600]  The FDA unanimously voted to authorize both the Pfizer and the Moderna vaccines for children as young as six months old.
[1:00:55.600 --> 1:01:00.600]  And the CDC joyfully recommends that every child get one.
[1:01:00.600 --> 1:01:15.600]  I know many parents with very young children have been anticipating this day. We now know based on rigorous scientific review that the vaccines available here in the United States can be used safely and effectively in children under five.
[1:01:15.600 --> 1:01:23.600]  Vaccinating young children is a critical opportunity to protect them against hospitalization and death from COVID-19.
[1:01:23.600 --> 1:01:28.600]  Parents, I strongly encourage you to get your children vaccinated.
[1:01:28.600 --> 1:01:43.600]  The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines involve the radical new mRNA technology that we now know is spreading throughout the entire body and altering the person's DNA.
[1:01:43.600 --> 1:01:51.600]  Thousands of medical doctors have been speaking out about this, including one of the inventors of mRNA technology.
[1:01:51.600 --> 1:01:58.600]  Several nations have suspended these vaccines due to serious injuries and deaths.
[1:01:58.600 --> 1:02:05.600]  And yet we are still being lied to by our own government who wants us to sacrifice our youngest children.
[1:02:05.600 --> 1:02:09.600]  My name is Dr. Ashish John. I am the White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator.
[1:02:09.600 --> 1:02:17.600]  I have some really exciting news. The FDA and the CDC just authorized vaccines for kids under five.
[1:02:17.600 --> 1:02:22.600]  These vaccines are incredibly safe. They work to prevent serious illness.
[1:02:22.600 --> 1:02:33.600]  That's why I have gotten all three of my children vaccinated, and now if you're a parent of a kid under five, it's a great time to go out and get your child protected. Get them vaccinated.
[1:02:33.600 --> 1:02:43.600]  The White House's official doctor has claimed that these vaccines are incredibly safe, which we know is a lie.
[1:02:43.600 --> 1:02:52.600]  There are more deadly side effects attributed to the COVID-19 vaccines than with any other vaccine in history.
[1:02:52.600 --> 1:03:11.600]  From severe allergic reactions to full-blown AIDS and sudden death, there is a well-documented risk of myocarditis in young men and adolescent boys and severe blood clotting in young women.
[1:03:11.600 --> 1:03:18.600]  We have seen a massive increase in heart attacks and paralysis.
[1:03:18.600 --> 1:03:29.600]  The vaccinated keep getting sick, and it's now officially being reported that the more vaccinated you are, the more likely you are to get sick.
[1:03:29.600 --> 1:03:46.600]  We now know to expect late-onset effects from these vaccines, such as adverse immune response to infection, neurological disorders, autoimmune disease, and pregnancy-related problems.
[1:03:46.600 --> 1:03:52.600]  The vaccine was suspended in over a dozen countries because of massive blood clots.
[1:03:52.600 --> 1:04:05.600]  The UK reports a half a million deaths of the vaccinated, while the US is seeing a 20% increase in deaths and a 10% increase in disability.
[1:04:05.600 --> 1:04:16.600]  And even Pfizer has admitted in their own documents that these vaccines are causing just about every possible negative side effect imaginable.
[1:04:16.600 --> 1:04:23.600]  And our government wants every child in America to get these shots.
[1:04:23.600 --> 1:04:50.600]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Rees.
[1:04:53.600 --> 1:05:04.600]  The Internet and Talk Radio are on fire with the slogan, Alex Jones is right.
[1:05:04.600 --> 1:05:06.600]  People ask, what's it like to be vindicated?
[1:05:06.600 --> 1:05:22.600]  Well, it's actually a very sick feeling because I knew this was coming, I tried to stop it, and now everything I've talked about is going to become more important than ever because the globalists aren't hiding it anymore in policy reports and documents.
[1:05:22.600 --> 1:05:30.600]  Now, out in the open, Klaus Schwab said last week that they rule the Earth, the Bilderberg group founded Davos Group.
[1:05:30.600 --> 1:05:36.600]  So now, the fight's out in the open, they're making their move because they know they're behind schedule.
[1:05:36.600 --> 1:05:37.600]  We're going to win this thing.
[1:05:37.600 --> 1:05:39.600]  God's watching, the children are counting on us.
[1:05:39.600 --> 1:05:46.600]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and your financial support because without you, InfoWars would not be here.
[1:05:46.600 --> 1:05:53.600]  I just want you to really internalize the fact that you are the InfoWars and you are the reason humanity has a fighting chance.
[1:05:53.600 --> 1:05:59.600]  So I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done and ask you now to redouble your efforts.
[1:05:59.600 --> 1:06:16.600]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[1:06:16.600 --> 1:06:21.600]  Alright, we're now into hour number two and I've cleared the decks of guests so we can take a lot of calls today.
[1:06:21.600 --> 1:06:24.600]  We did a pretty good job yesterday but didn't get to everybody I wanted to.
[1:06:24.600 --> 1:06:36.600]  So at the end of this segment, I'm going to give the number out for first-time callers, long-time callers, people that agree, people that disagree, any topic you want to discuss, anything you want to get into.
[1:06:36.600 --> 1:06:40.600]  But I would ask for those that want to comment, what do you make of the great reset?
[1:06:40.600 --> 1:06:42.600]  What do you make of the economic war that's going on?
[1:06:42.600 --> 1:06:47.600]  What do you make of saying six month olds and up now can take these experimental deadly shots?
[1:06:47.600 --> 1:06:49.600]  It's just incredible.
[1:06:49.600 --> 1:06:52.600]  I'd like to get your take on that as well.
[1:06:52.600 --> 1:06:55.600]  There's so much more we'll get to as we interspersed the calls.
[1:06:55.600 --> 1:07:03.600]  I've got a whole stack of human animal cloning, a whole stack of transhumanism next level, the AI spies inside your house.
[1:07:03.600 --> 1:07:05.600]  This is a very important stack right here.
[1:07:05.600 --> 1:07:08.600]  We'll be getting to the last segment of this hour.
[1:07:08.600 --> 1:07:22.600]  But the toll-free number to join us on air is 877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539.
[1:07:22.600 --> 1:07:24.600]  I would love to hear from you.
[1:07:24.600 --> 1:07:27.600]  The last thing the system wants is us talking to each other.
[1:07:27.600 --> 1:07:34.600]  The last thing they want is you unfiltered giving out your views and your reports and your ideas.
[1:07:34.600 --> 1:07:38.600]  Personally, and other wrestlers as well, love it.
[1:07:38.600 --> 1:07:46.600]  Exercising the First Amendment in front of millions and millions and millions of people, that is powerful.
[1:07:46.600 --> 1:07:50.600]  877-789-2539.
[1:07:50.600 --> 1:07:54.600]  All right, a bunch of just really big news on the cover front.
[1:07:54.600 --> 1:08:03.600]  It just gets bigger and bigger as the program of their evil becomes very clear as we're now 30 plus months into it.
[1:08:03.600 --> 1:08:11.600]  The United Nations Associated Press is reporting that they're on the verge of announcing a new global emergency and new pandemic.
[1:08:11.600 --> 1:08:19.600]  Now, used to, it was based on real cases and real numbers, but now they can just say it's an emergency and a pandemic
[1:08:19.600 --> 1:08:25.600]  and then institute all those powers that the UN has been trying to get nation states to sign on to, signing away their sovereignty.
[1:08:25.600 --> 1:08:33.600]  AP reports, World Health Organization considers declaring Monkeypox a global health emergency.
[1:08:33.600 --> 1:08:39.600]  The World Health Organization convenes its emergency committee today to consider if the spiraling, the spiraling,
[1:08:39.600 --> 1:08:43.600]  don't give you numbers or scientific facts, it's very, very rare.
[1:08:43.600 --> 1:08:45.600]  Spiraling just sounds bad.
[1:08:45.600 --> 1:08:51.600]  The spiraling outbreak of Monkeypox warrants being declared a global emergency.
[1:08:51.600 --> 1:09:00.600]  But some experts say the WHO's decision to act only after the disease spilled to the West could entrench the grotesque inequities
[1:09:00.600 --> 1:09:04.600]  that arose between the rich and poor countries during the coronavirus pandemic.
[1:09:04.600 --> 1:09:10.600]  So it has nothing to do with, is this really a threat? Why are they hyping it? Where did it come from?
[1:09:10.600 --> 1:09:14.600]  It's really a vaccine side effect. They admit it's identical to it.
[1:09:14.600 --> 1:09:21.600]  No, it's inequity. We're not giving enough money to the Third World, which means to the United Nations.
[1:09:21.600 --> 1:09:27.600]  Declaring Monkeypox to be a global emergency would mean the UN Health Agency considers the outbreak to be an extraordinary event.
[1:09:27.600 --> 1:09:33.600]  And the disease is at risk of spreading across even more borders, possibly requiring a global response.
[1:09:33.600 --> 1:09:39.600]  It would also give Monkeypox the same distinction as COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing efforts to eradicate polio.
[1:09:39.600 --> 1:09:50.600]  So the next lockdown, the next big emergency is here, as we predicted months ago, when they had the truck turn over in Pennsylvania with the monkeys on it.
[1:09:50.600 --> 1:09:56.600]  Here's the sun reporting the first outbreak of highly infectious polio, which is, again, tied to the vaccine.
[1:09:56.600 --> 1:10:01.600]  They just call it that. Detected in UK since 1984.
[1:10:01.600 --> 1:10:09.600]  And then this, toddlers' tears as the nation's children begin to receive the COVID shots, the New York Post reports.
[1:10:09.600 --> 1:10:16.600]  Yes, the tears of having their immune systems erased, the tears of blood clots and heart attacks in microcarditis,
[1:10:16.600 --> 1:10:23.600]  the tears of having their future destroyed with an experimental shot giving liability protection to the very eugenicist carrying it out.
[1:10:23.600 --> 1:10:33.600]  But who would believe they would do something like this to children so people under Stockholm syndrome give into it because they just can't face the real heart.
[1:10:33.600 --> 1:10:40.600]  Continuing, shameful. The American Academy of Pediatrics shills for COVID vaccine for children.
[1:10:40.600 --> 1:10:46.600]  Don Salazar reports at infowars.com and it goes through the fact that children don't get sick from COVID often.
[1:10:46.600 --> 1:10:51.600]  They never die from COVID. It's always a comorbidity of heart defect or cancer.
[1:10:51.600 --> 1:10:56.600]  And the vaccine isn't a vaccine. It doesn't work.
[1:10:56.600 --> 1:11:03.600]  Why are they doing it? Because they're targeting our children to set the precedent to kill us and get away with it.
[1:11:03.600 --> 1:11:09.600]  And where it just becomes a background noise to see if they can get away with releasing even more deadly viruses in the future.
[1:11:09.600 --> 1:11:10.600]  But there's good news.
[1:11:10.600 --> 1:11:21.600]  Public's pharmacy refuses to offer COVID vaccines to children under age five.
[1:11:21.600 --> 1:11:26.600]  And Publix is obviously owned by a very conservative patriotic family that's been a supporter of this broadcast.
[1:11:26.600 --> 1:11:30.600]  And there you go. They're now saying they will not take part of it.
[1:11:30.600 --> 1:11:41.600]  Representatives said company would not offer the jab. It was more than 1,000 stores, mainly in Florida, to children under age five at this time adding they would not issue a formal statement on the decision.
[1:11:41.600 --> 1:11:45.600]  Good job to the owners of Publix.
[1:11:45.600 --> 1:11:52.600]  And DeSantis has come out and said do not give it to under age five kudos to Governor DeSantis.
[1:11:52.600 --> 1:11:56.600]  By the way, that four minute clip we played at DeSantis was so powerful yesterday.
[1:11:56.600 --> 1:12:02.600]  It's posted a Band-Aid video, but wow. No wonder I've got a whole stack of articles right here.
[1:12:02.600 --> 1:12:12.600]  That DeSantis is now in every major national poll, including New Hampshire polls, way ahead of Trump.
[1:12:12.600 --> 1:12:19.600]  That's coming up. Yeah, Trump, it's horribly unpopular with your base.
[1:12:19.600 --> 1:12:29.600]  You're based and forgive you for being stampeded into it if you now come out against it, but you don't do it because you are pigheaded.
[1:12:29.600 --> 1:12:34.600]  Is Trump a bad person? No. Does Trump mean well? Absolutely.
[1:12:34.600 --> 1:12:38.600]  But man, you know some really smart people, you know, just got blind spots.
[1:12:38.600 --> 1:12:40.600]  I mean, I'm the same way. I got blind spots in my life.
[1:12:40.600 --> 1:12:45.600]  I have temper control problems.
[1:12:45.600 --> 1:12:54.600]  Jesus said, let he who without sin cast the first stone.
[1:12:54.600 --> 1:12:58.600]  So I've done plenty of wrong by accident.
[1:12:58.600 --> 1:13:07.600]  I've been wrong plenty of times by accident, but never, never, never, never, never.
[1:13:07.600 --> 1:13:12.600]  Did I consciously screw anybody over? Did I ever break my promises?
[1:13:12.600 --> 1:13:16.600]  Never. That is my most valuable spiritual asset.
[1:13:16.600 --> 1:13:20.600]  And I didn't come by that asset realizing how valuable it was.
[1:13:20.600 --> 1:13:26.600]  It was ingrained in me genetically, spiritually, historically by nature and nurture.
[1:13:26.600 --> 1:13:30.600]  But I look around the world and I see the problem with leadership.
[1:13:30.600 --> 1:13:34.600]  And I see that most people don't get that doing the right thing.
[1:13:34.600 --> 1:13:39.600]  Even when you're under heat is the most valuable thing in the universe because we're following God's directives.
[1:13:39.600 --> 1:13:45.600]  And I'm so happy about Trump fighting China's corruption and getting better trade deals
[1:13:45.600 --> 1:13:48.600]  and securing the borders and being pro-gun.
[1:13:48.600 --> 1:13:51.600]  And all the things he did were so good.
[1:13:51.600 --> 1:13:59.600]  But man, I look at DeSantis and he has just pulled way ahead of Trump because he's telling the truth
[1:13:59.600 --> 1:14:01.600]  and because he's resonating with the people.
[1:14:01.600 --> 1:14:06.600]  And I want Trump to wake up in me like that as well.
[1:14:06.600 --> 1:14:10.600]  But he's not doing it.
[1:14:10.600 --> 1:14:12.600]  And so it's a real shame.
[1:14:12.600 --> 1:14:15.600]  But you know, Trump's almost as old as Biden.
[1:14:15.600 --> 1:14:19.600]  And if he wants to put himself out to pasture, then that's his issue.
[1:14:19.600 --> 1:14:22.600]  Because I'm not trying to get a job at DeSantis or a job at Trump.
[1:14:22.600 --> 1:14:24.600]  I'm trying to find the best person to back.
[1:14:24.600 --> 1:14:29.600]  And I'm just telling you DeSantis, I've gone from really liking DeSantis to just...
[1:14:29.600 --> 1:14:32.600]  There's no way he's bad at things he's doing.
[1:14:32.600 --> 1:14:36.600]  He is fighting them directly. He believes in his children and his wife.
[1:14:36.600 --> 1:14:38.600]  He believes in you.
[1:14:38.600 --> 1:14:41.600]  And he is taking them on because he's not an anti-human.
[1:14:41.600 --> 1:14:44.600]  And I'll just say this to Governor DeSantis.
[1:14:51.600 --> 1:14:54.600]  You got my back in, baby.
[1:14:54.600 --> 1:14:57.600]  I am so proud of what you're doing.
[1:14:57.600 --> 1:14:59.600]  And I want to see a lot more of that.
[1:14:59.600 --> 1:15:03.600]  Just like Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro's way better than Trump.
[1:15:03.600 --> 1:15:06.600]  And as much as I like Trump, as much as I like the hope he put out,
[1:15:06.600 --> 1:15:09.600]  as much as I like how he fought,
[1:15:09.600 --> 1:15:10.600]  Bolsonaro's better.
[1:15:10.600 --> 1:15:12.600]  Ron DeSantis is better.
[1:15:12.600 --> 1:15:15.600]  Victor Urban is better.
[1:15:15.600 --> 1:15:18.600]  And so maybe Trump will hear that.
[1:15:18.600 --> 1:15:20.600]  I know they listen.
[1:15:20.600 --> 1:15:23.600]  Because I don't even try to sit there and talk to Trump.
[1:15:23.600 --> 1:15:27.600]  And be patted on the head in a conversation with him.
[1:15:27.600 --> 1:15:31.600]  I want Trump to man up and realize he's tied himself to a big loser
[1:15:31.600 --> 1:15:33.600]  with this poison shot.
[1:15:33.600 --> 1:15:35.600]  And he needs to pull out of this as quickly as possible.
[1:15:35.600 --> 1:15:36.600]  I got more to hit, though.
[1:15:36.600 --> 1:15:38.600]  The big COVID is when we come back.
[1:15:38.600 --> 1:15:39.600]  It's the biggest.

[1:20:36.600 --> 1:20:38.600]  To the globalists now, their system of
[1:20:38.600 --> 1:20:41.600]  proxy schemes and derivatives
[1:20:41.600 --> 1:20:44.600]  and deflationary policies
[1:20:44.600 --> 1:20:46.600]  is coming to an end.
[1:20:46.600 --> 1:20:48.600]  So they want to blame you and blame COVID
[1:20:48.600 --> 1:20:51.600]  and collapse the world and bring in their new system
[1:20:51.600 --> 1:20:52.600]  in the back of it,
[1:20:52.600 --> 1:20:54.600]  but they're not going to get away with it.
[1:20:54.600 --> 1:20:56.600]  I'll go to your phone calls here in just a few minutes,
[1:20:56.600 --> 1:20:58.600]  but let's continue with these headlines.
[1:20:58.600 --> 1:21:02.600]  COVID vaccine's more likely to put you in the hospital
[1:21:02.600 --> 1:21:04.600]  than keep you out.
[1:21:04.600 --> 1:21:06.600]  British Medical Journal Editor,
[1:21:06.600 --> 1:21:08.600]  not just a paper, the editor,
[1:21:08.600 --> 1:21:12.600]  analysis of Pfizer and Moderna data finds.
[1:21:12.600 --> 1:21:15.600]  Huge article, huge report.
[1:21:15.600 --> 1:21:18.600]  It's up at infowars.com.
[1:21:18.600 --> 1:21:20.600]  And here's the actual study.
[1:21:20.600 --> 1:21:24.600]  Serious adverse events of special interests
[1:21:24.600 --> 1:21:29.600]  following mRNA vaccination in random trials.
[1:21:29.600 --> 1:21:34.600]  The editor of the British Medical Journal
[1:21:34.600 --> 1:21:39.600]  with an index of trials.
[1:21:39.600 --> 1:21:42.600]  And even the Israeli News reports,
[1:21:42.600 --> 1:21:45.600]  BMJ senior editor,
[1:21:45.600 --> 1:21:47.600]  COVID vaccine's more likely to put you in the hospital
[1:21:47.600 --> 1:21:49.600]  than keep you out.
[1:21:49.600 --> 1:21:51.600]  Wow.
[1:21:51.600 --> 1:21:56.600]  And their answer is let's give it to six months old.
[1:21:56.600 --> 1:21:58.600]  That's what's incredible.
[1:21:58.600 --> 1:22:00.600]  And if you try to put this study out on Twitter
[1:22:00.600 --> 1:22:03.600]  or Instagram or Facebook or they block you.
[1:22:03.600 --> 1:22:07.600]  And the Pfizer CEO says he's almost certain
[1:22:07.600 --> 1:22:10.600]  Americans will have to take the new COVID vaccine
[1:22:10.600 --> 1:22:13.600]  every year that continues to erase your immune system
[1:22:13.600 --> 1:22:16.600]  and make you sicker and sicker and sicker.
[1:22:16.600 --> 1:22:20.600]  Everybody I know getting sick took the shot.
[1:22:20.600 --> 1:22:22.600]  Remember this broke in the last few days.
[1:22:22.600 --> 1:22:24.600]  World Health Organization chief believes COVID
[1:22:24.600 --> 1:22:26.600]  did leak from the Wuhan lab.
[1:22:26.600 --> 1:22:28.600]  But if you try to share that,
[1:22:28.600 --> 1:22:33.600]  Big Tech will not let you do it.
[1:22:33.600 --> 1:22:35.600]  That's pretty amazing.
[1:22:35.600 --> 1:22:37.600]  And here's this meme going around.
[1:22:37.600 --> 1:22:40.600]  She shows a female doctor in her lab coat
[1:22:40.600 --> 1:22:43.600]  with cash hanging out of her pockets from Big Pharma.
[1:22:43.600 --> 1:22:46.600]  She says sudden adult death syndrome killed him
[1:22:46.600 --> 1:22:51.600]  as she's got the needle in her hand.
[1:22:51.600 --> 1:22:55.600]  Another great meme is Joe Biden licking on an ice cream cone
[1:22:55.600 --> 1:22:57.600]  because they had it at that gay bar,
[1:22:57.600 --> 1:22:59.600]  drag queen story time with little kids.
[1:22:59.600 --> 1:23:03.600]  It's not gonna lick itself.
[1:23:03.600 --> 1:23:05.600]  Let me have the question,
[1:23:05.600 --> 1:23:09.600]  did the Evaldi cops end up shooting?
[1:23:09.600 --> 1:23:12.600]  Their body cam footage has the answer.
[1:23:12.600 --> 1:23:16.600]  That's coming up after I take more of your phone calls
[1:23:16.600 --> 1:23:19.600]  or some of your phone calls I haven't gotten to yet today.
[1:23:19.600 --> 1:23:23.600]  Craig, Joe, DJ, Jordan, Robert, Eric, Brian, Alec,
[1:23:23.600 --> 1:23:25.600]  Tyler, Josh, and more.
[1:23:25.600 --> 1:23:28.600]  We're taking all your calls today
[1:23:28.600 --> 1:23:30.600]  in the order that they are received.
[1:23:30.600 --> 1:23:32.600]  First up, Craig in Ohio.
[1:23:32.600 --> 1:23:35.600]  Welcome, Craig.
[1:23:35.600 --> 1:23:36.600]  Hello, Alex, are you there?
[1:23:36.600 --> 1:23:38.600]  I am. Go ahead.
[1:23:38.600 --> 1:23:40.600]  Oh, hey.
[1:23:40.600 --> 1:23:43.600]  I know our time is short, but I wanted to get right to this.
[1:23:43.600 --> 1:23:46.600]  I've been kind of running a parallel track with you
[1:23:46.600 --> 1:23:49.600]  for 25-plus years as an independent trader.
[1:23:49.600 --> 1:23:52.600]  And I hear you say you've been stabbing on the back
[1:23:52.600 --> 1:23:53.600]  for a long time.
[1:23:53.600 --> 1:23:55.600]  I feel like the same thing.
[1:23:55.600 --> 1:23:57.600]  When I traded in Chicago a long time ago
[1:23:57.600 --> 1:23:59.600]  when I first got my start,
[1:23:59.600 --> 1:24:02.600]  I ran across a few people, developed a model
[1:24:02.600 --> 1:24:05.600]  that was able to take a real snapshot into the market.
[1:24:05.600 --> 1:24:09.600]  And on occasion, you get these energy build-up zones
[1:24:09.600 --> 1:24:11.600]  where they can't manipulate it.
[1:24:11.600 --> 1:24:13.600]  They can't cheat it, right?
[1:24:13.600 --> 1:24:16.600]  So I can tell just...
[1:24:16.600 --> 1:24:18.600]  It's a really hard thing to explain,
[1:24:18.600 --> 1:24:21.600]  but just like you say, you know, Alex Jones is right.
[1:24:21.600 --> 1:24:23.600]  You know, sometimes I say Craig was right,
[1:24:23.600 --> 1:24:26.600]  not out of, you know, ego,
[1:24:26.600 --> 1:24:29.600]  but just blown away by this glimpse
[1:24:29.600 --> 1:24:31.600]  you get into reality, right?
[1:24:31.600 --> 1:24:32.600]  These natural things.
[1:24:32.600 --> 1:24:34.600]  I mean, it's like if you're a good carpenter,
[1:24:34.600 --> 1:24:37.600]  you know how to build a bed or a desk.
[1:24:37.600 --> 1:24:40.600]  Or if you're a good marksman,
[1:24:40.600 --> 1:24:42.600]  you know how to teach people how to shoot.
[1:24:42.600 --> 1:24:44.600]  Or you're a great doctor or a great scientist.
[1:24:44.600 --> 1:24:46.600]  No, when you're right, you need to say,
[1:24:46.600 --> 1:24:47.600]  hey, I know how to do this.
[1:24:47.600 --> 1:24:48.600]  I'm a great farmer.
[1:24:48.600 --> 1:24:49.600]  I'm a great teacher.
[1:24:49.600 --> 1:24:50.600]  I'm a great pastor.
[1:24:50.600 --> 1:24:52.600]  You know, I'm a great father.
[1:24:52.600 --> 1:24:53.600]  I'm a great mother.
[1:24:53.600 --> 1:24:55.600]  No, it's good when you have a value.
[1:24:55.600 --> 1:24:56.600]  You need to say, I've been right.
[1:24:56.600 --> 1:24:58.600]  I've been, we need to be, do that.
[1:24:58.600 --> 1:25:00.600]  We need to do that more.
[1:25:00.600 --> 1:25:01.600]  Yeah, I agree.
[1:25:01.600 --> 1:25:03.600]  And so I don't want to come across with an ego,
[1:25:03.600 --> 1:25:06.600]  but what I do want to come across with some, you know,
[1:25:06.600 --> 1:25:08.600]  directness and force that, you know,
[1:25:08.600 --> 1:25:10.600]  I've seen things for 25 years.
[1:25:10.600 --> 1:25:12.600]  I've seen shenanigans go on, right?
[1:25:12.600 --> 1:25:14.600]  Manipulations, manipulations.
[1:25:14.600 --> 1:25:16.600]  You go back to long-term capital,
[1:25:16.600 --> 1:25:19.600]  Asian currency crisis, 2008, just like Edd out.
[1:25:19.600 --> 1:25:23.600]  And Edd out, I just can't express how right he is
[1:25:23.600 --> 1:25:24.600]  on what he's saying.
[1:25:24.600 --> 1:25:26.600]  I've listened to him as much as I can,
[1:25:26.600 --> 1:25:28.600]  but he's from a research perspective, right?
[1:25:28.600 --> 1:25:30.600]  I see it from a slightly different perspective
[1:25:30.600 --> 1:25:32.600]  from the trade perspective where the actual money
[1:25:32.600 --> 1:25:35.600]  changes again right in front of my face, right?
[1:25:35.600 --> 1:25:39.600]  And so Edd sees it from a, okay, I have to be a contrarian.
[1:25:39.600 --> 1:25:40.600]  I understand.
[1:25:40.600 --> 1:25:41.600]  So you're a big trader.
[1:25:41.600 --> 1:25:42.600]  You're a smart guy you've been right before.
[1:25:42.600 --> 1:25:44.600]  What do you see happening?
[1:25:44.600 --> 1:25:45.600]  Yeah.
[1:25:45.600 --> 1:25:48.600]  So what I see is the manipulations, Alex,
[1:25:48.600 --> 1:25:50.600]  have just ramped up over the last 25 years,
[1:25:50.600 --> 1:25:53.600]  just, you know, non-linear, just exponentially, right?
[1:25:53.600 --> 1:25:56.600]  And right now we're in a spot where, you know,
[1:25:56.600 --> 1:25:58.600]  everybody wants to go to gold, right?
[1:25:58.600 --> 1:26:00.600]  Because they think it's a safety net.
[1:26:00.600 --> 1:26:02.600]  And I've been saying for a long time, look,
[1:26:02.600 --> 1:26:04.600]  we're deflationary, right?
[1:26:04.600 --> 1:26:06.600]  The only reason we have inflation
[1:26:06.600 --> 1:26:08.600]  is it's a synthetic-driven inflation, right?
[1:26:08.600 --> 1:26:11.600]  And so, and Edd doesn't disagree with this, right?
[1:26:11.600 --> 1:26:13.600]  And so other people don't disagree.
[1:26:13.600 --> 1:26:15.600]  A lot of people want to disagree with it,
[1:26:15.600 --> 1:26:16.600]  but the point of knowledge...
[1:26:16.600 --> 1:26:17.600]  It's okay.
[1:26:17.600 --> 1:26:18.600]  Give us your view.
[1:26:18.600 --> 1:26:19.600]  You don't need to preface it with other people's side.
[1:26:19.600 --> 1:26:20.600]  Give us your view.
[1:26:20.600 --> 1:26:21.600]  Yeah.
[1:26:21.600 --> 1:26:24.600]  So my view is that, you know, we are in very weird times,
[1:26:24.600 --> 1:26:27.600]  and you cannot bank on things that have happened in the past, right?
[1:26:27.600 --> 1:26:29.600]  So stocks go up, bonds go down.
[1:26:29.600 --> 1:26:31.600]  Bonds go up, stocks go down, right?
[1:26:31.600 --> 1:26:34.600]  Yeah, we're in a synthetic, totally manipulated market.
[1:26:34.600 --> 1:26:35.600]  Yes.
[1:26:35.600 --> 1:26:37.600]  And so the point of the matter is that
[1:26:37.600 --> 1:26:39.600]  don't bank on gold, everyone,
[1:26:39.600 --> 1:26:42.600]  because remember, they know you're long gold, right?
[1:26:42.600 --> 1:26:44.600]  They know you're betting on gold going up.
[1:26:44.600 --> 1:26:46.600]  So if you go up, and they are out there, Alex,
[1:26:46.600 --> 1:26:48.600]  I'm... they are out there...
[1:26:48.600 --> 1:26:50.600]  Don't you think we should be in everything?
[1:26:50.600 --> 1:26:52.600]  Some in real estate, if you have the money.
[1:26:52.600 --> 1:26:54.600]  Crypto, some gold, silver.
[1:26:54.600 --> 1:26:57.600]  You really politically engage as where your money should be.
[1:26:57.600 --> 1:27:00.600]  I mean, I think diversification is the answer.
[1:27:00.600 --> 1:27:01.600]  What do you think?
[1:27:01.600 --> 1:27:05.600]  Well, you know, sometimes I disagree with that,
[1:27:05.600 --> 1:27:08.600]  because I think sometimes you have to take calculated bet,
[1:27:08.600 --> 1:27:11.600]  and you have to be convicted, and you have to stay with them,
[1:27:11.600 --> 1:27:14.600]  and you have to chop wood, chop wood, chop wood to stay with them.
[1:27:14.600 --> 1:27:15.600]  Okay, great.
[1:27:15.600 --> 1:27:16.600]  Give us your predictions with one and a half minutes left.
[1:27:16.600 --> 1:27:19.600]  What do you think crypto is going?
[1:27:19.600 --> 1:27:21.600]  Well, I mean...
[1:27:21.600 --> 1:27:26.600]  So again, let me just reiterate where I come from, right?
[1:27:26.600 --> 1:27:28.600]  We don't need to hear where you came from.
[1:27:28.600 --> 1:27:30.600]  We're almost out of time.
[1:27:30.600 --> 1:27:33.600]  I'm asking you, what are your predictions?
[1:27:33.600 --> 1:27:35.600]  Well, see, Alex, it doesn't work like that, right?
[1:27:35.600 --> 1:27:37.600]  I'm not going to predict...
[1:27:37.600 --> 1:27:40.600]  I can give you Craig's philosophy, but quantitatively,
[1:27:40.600 --> 1:27:42.600]  cyclically, right?
[1:27:42.600 --> 1:27:44.600]  I think this is a glimpse into God's world, right?
[1:27:44.600 --> 1:27:46.600]  When you look at the nature and the cycles of these things,
[1:27:46.600 --> 1:27:49.600]  when you get a signal, it just builds energy,
[1:27:49.600 --> 1:27:51.600]  and then you know where it's going to go,
[1:27:51.600 --> 1:27:53.600]  based off harmonic eighth levels.
[1:27:53.600 --> 1:27:55.600]  It's like music, right? It just is the way it is.
[1:27:55.600 --> 1:27:58.600]  Well, it's true. The NSA is following trends
[1:27:58.600 --> 1:28:00.600]  to try to jump on the trends.
[1:28:00.600 --> 1:28:03.600]  The system is even able to create trends.
[1:28:03.600 --> 1:28:05.600]  They jump on the trends. I appreciate your call.
[1:28:05.600 --> 1:28:07.600]  And I think that's where you're going with this,
[1:28:07.600 --> 1:28:08.600]  but I'm not mad at you.
[1:28:08.600 --> 1:28:11.600]  I just don't want a nebulous statement here,
[1:28:11.600 --> 1:28:13.600]  because we can sit there and talk about,
[1:28:13.600 --> 1:28:15.600]  okay, I've made a lot of predictions that are true.
[1:28:15.600 --> 1:28:17.600]  I've been really right, and then you don't want to tell us
[1:28:17.600 --> 1:28:19.600]  what you're saying is going on.
[1:28:19.600 --> 1:28:22.600]  None of us are perfect, but that's okay.
[1:28:22.600 --> 1:28:24.600]  I want to get in this next 10-minute segment
[1:28:24.600 --> 1:28:26.600]  to at least four or five callers.
[1:28:26.600 --> 1:28:28.600]  So we're going to go to break.
[1:28:28.600 --> 1:28:30.600]  We're going to come back and order the calls to receive
[1:28:30.600 --> 1:28:32.600]  and talk to Josh, and talk to Joe,
[1:28:32.600 --> 1:28:34.600]  and talk to Robert, and Brian, and Alec,
[1:28:34.600 --> 1:28:36.600]  and so many others on the other side.
[1:28:36.600 --> 1:28:39.600]  What we know is there's an artificial cutoff of energy,
[1:28:39.600 --> 1:28:41.600]  which will collapse the whole economy.
[1:28:41.600 --> 1:28:43.600]  They're going to bring in a new global world ID
[1:28:43.600 --> 1:28:45.600]  with carbon tax and social credit score
[1:28:45.600 --> 1:28:47.600]  with a vaccine passport.
[1:28:47.600 --> 1:28:49.600]  That's all admitted. That's here.
[1:28:49.600 --> 1:28:50.600]  And we should be debating,
[1:28:50.600 --> 1:28:52.600]  what does that mean to the world economy?
[1:28:52.600 --> 1:28:54.600]  What does that mean to us individually?
[1:28:54.600 --> 1:29:14.600]  Stay with us.
[1:29:25.600 --> 1:29:28.600]  The Builderburg Group founded Davos Group.
[1:29:28.600 --> 1:29:31.600]  So now the fight's out in the open.
[1:29:31.600 --> 1:29:33.600]  They're making their move because they know
[1:29:33.600 --> 1:29:35.600]  they're behind schedule.
[1:29:35.600 --> 1:29:37.600]  We're going to win this thing.
[1:29:37.600 --> 1:29:39.600]  God's watching. The children are counting on us.
[1:29:39.600 --> 1:29:41.600]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners
[1:29:41.600 --> 1:29:43.600]  for your word of mouth and your prayer
[1:29:43.600 --> 1:29:45.600]  and your financial support, because without you,
[1:29:45.600 --> 1:29:47.600]  Info Wars would not be here.
[1:29:47.600 --> 1:29:49.600]  I just want you to really internalize the fact
[1:29:49.600 --> 1:29:51.600]  that you are the Info War, and you are the reason
[1:29:51.600 --> 1:29:53.600]  humanity has a fighting chance.
[1:29:53.600 --> 1:29:55.600]  Thank you for all you've done,
[1:29:55.600 --> 1:30:24.600]  to redouble your efforts.
[1:30:25.600 --> 1:30:27.600]  Thank you so much for watching.
[1:30:56.600 --> 1:30:58.600]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[1:30:58.600 --> 1:31:00.600]  high-quality, storeable food is back in stock,
[1:31:00.600 --> 1:31:02.600]  ready to ship right now.
[1:31:02.600 --> 1:31:04.600]  We've not been selling food for three months,
[1:31:04.600 --> 1:31:06.600]  because it was taking several weeks
[1:31:06.600 --> 1:31:08.600]  for the food to get packaged and delivered to you.
[1:31:08.600 --> 1:31:10.600]  Most of their companies are completely out,
[1:31:10.600 --> 1:31:12.600]  but now they have a large spectrum
[1:31:12.600 --> 1:31:14.600]  of high-quality food, ready to ship.
[1:31:14.600 --> 1:31:17.600]  Everything you find at PrepareWithAlex.com
[1:31:17.600 --> 1:31:20.600]  or PrepareToday.com is in stock, ready to ship.
[1:31:20.600 --> 1:31:22.600]  So go to PrepareWithAlex.com
[1:31:22.600 --> 1:31:24.600]  or PrepareToday.com
[1:31:24.600 --> 1:31:26.600]  and order your high-quality, storeable food
[1:31:26.600 --> 1:31:28.600]  right now, ready to ship to you and your family.
[1:31:28.600 --> 1:31:30.600]  With the inflation happening, with the food shortages,
[1:31:30.600 --> 1:31:32.600]  with the wars, with the collapsing wars,
[1:31:32.600 --> 1:31:34.600]  everything's happening.
[1:31:34.600 --> 1:31:36.600]  One of the most important things you can make
[1:31:36.600 --> 1:31:38.600]  is to have high-quality, storeable food,
[1:31:38.600 --> 1:31:40.600]  water filtration, air filtration and more.
[1:31:40.600 --> 1:31:42.600]  And it's not just those items, it's hundreds of other
[1:31:42.600 --> 1:31:44.600]  high-quality, preparedness items and survival items
[1:31:44.600 --> 1:31:46.600]  right now at PrepareWithAlex.com
[1:31:46.600 --> 1:31:50.600]  that, again, redirects to PrepareToday.com.
[1:31:50.600 --> 1:31:52.600]  I would not procrastinate, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:31:52.600 --> 1:31:54.600]  One of the most important things you can do
[1:31:54.600 --> 1:31:56.600]  is to get ahead of inflation now
[1:31:56.600 --> 1:31:58.600]  because the inflation is just beginning.
[1:32:00.600 --> 1:32:02.600]  Jacob in Ohio, welcome, go ahead.
[1:32:02.600 --> 1:32:04.600]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[1:32:04.600 --> 1:32:06.600]  Great, last caller.
[1:32:06.600 --> 1:32:08.600]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[1:32:08.600 --> 1:32:10.600]  It's basically the only way I get to sleep anymore
[1:32:10.600 --> 1:32:12.600]  with all the gaslighting, the moralization
[1:32:12.600 --> 1:32:14.600]  and absurdity.
[1:32:14.600 --> 1:32:16.600]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone, man.
[1:32:16.600 --> 1:32:18.600]  All right, Eric in New Hampshire. Eric, thanks for calling.
[1:32:18.600 --> 1:32:20.600]  Go ahead.
[1:32:20.600 --> 1:32:22.600]  Well, if I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out
[1:32:22.600 --> 1:32:24.600]  for the point of the product.
[1:32:24.600 --> 1:32:26.600]  The XTube does wonders.
[1:32:26.600 --> 1:32:28.600]  They recommend it to everybody.
[1:32:28.600 --> 1:32:30.600]  You're on the fence about it. Get off the fence,
[1:32:30.600 --> 1:32:32.600]  get the product, support the import.
[1:32:32.600 --> 1:32:34.600]  Tyler in Maine, you're on the air. Thanks for rolling.
[1:32:34.600 --> 1:32:36.600]  Go ahead. Hey, Alex, it's great to be on with you.
[1:32:36.600 --> 1:32:38.600]  It's an honor. Honour, talk to you.
[1:32:38.600 --> 1:32:40.600]  Awesome. So, personally, I wanted to do is
[1:32:40.600 --> 1:32:42.600]  say I love the products, Alpha Power,
[1:32:42.600 --> 1:32:44.600]  even at 29 if you ask my better half.
[1:32:44.600 --> 1:32:46.600]  She loves it and it helps in the bedroom.
[1:32:46.600 --> 1:32:48.600]  So, just number one for a few of you.
[1:32:48.600 --> 1:32:50.600]  Well, it definitely works. It's not a joke.
[1:32:50.600 --> 1:32:52.600]  Absolutely.
[1:32:58.600 --> 1:33:00.600]  Leading a frontal assault
[1:33:00.600 --> 1:33:02.600]  on the lies of the New World Order,
[1:33:02.600 --> 1:33:18.600]  it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:18.600 --> 1:33:38.600]  Live from theInfoHorse.com Studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:38.600 --> 1:33:44.600]  I got no friends.
[1:33:44.600 --> 1:33:48.600]  Let's talk to
[1:33:48.600 --> 1:33:50.600]  Alex in North Carolina.
[1:33:50.600 --> 1:33:52.600]  Alex, you're on the air. Welcome, sir.
[1:33:52.600 --> 1:33:54.600]  Yes, sir. Mr. Jones.
[1:33:54.600 --> 1:33:56.600]  Yes, sir.
[1:33:56.600 --> 1:33:58.600]  Hey, I just wanted to let you know, man,
[1:33:58.600 --> 1:34:00.600]  I got the chills while I was waiting to talk to you,
[1:34:00.600 --> 1:34:02.600]  because, I mean, it's been a long time coming.
[1:34:02.600 --> 1:34:04.600]  I'm a first-time caller and I just want to,
[1:34:04.600 --> 1:34:06.600]  I just want to thank you for everything you do.
[1:34:06.600 --> 1:34:08.600]  So, first off, I wanted to mention,
[1:34:08.600 --> 1:34:10.600]  so I joined the fight.
[1:34:10.600 --> 1:34:12.600]  You're currently on the line
[1:34:12.600 --> 1:34:14.600]  and you're doing the fight.
[1:34:14.600 --> 1:34:16.600]  Your courage is contagious, man.
[1:34:16.600 --> 1:34:18.600]  I put out a music video on YouTube.
[1:34:18.600 --> 1:34:20.600]  It's called Everything
[1:34:20.600 --> 1:34:22.600]  by Alec Anderson,
[1:34:22.600 --> 1:34:24.600]  ALEC Anderson,
[1:34:24.600 --> 1:34:26.600]  and YouTube will not let me promote it.
[1:34:26.600 --> 1:34:28.600]  So, I thought, well, what better to do
[1:34:28.600 --> 1:34:30.600]  than call up the man who inspired me
[1:34:30.600 --> 1:34:32.600]  and promote it on air.
[1:34:32.600 --> 1:34:34.600]  Well, that's beautiful.
[1:34:34.600 --> 1:34:36.600]  What's the name of the video again?
[1:34:36.600 --> 1:34:38.600]  It's Everything
[1:34:38.600 --> 1:34:40.600]  by Alec Anderson.
[1:34:40.600 --> 1:34:42.600]  Well, look it up, Everything
[1:34:42.600 --> 1:34:44.600]  by Alec Anderson.
[1:34:44.600 --> 1:34:46.600]  Yes, sir, yes, sir.
[1:34:46.600 --> 1:34:48.600]  So, yes, so they won't let me promote it
[1:34:48.600 --> 1:34:50.600]  because they say sensitive subjects.
[1:34:50.600 --> 1:34:52.600]  You know what I mean?
[1:34:52.600 --> 1:34:54.600]  So, I touch on everything that's coming.
[1:34:54.600 --> 1:34:56.600]  You know, I'm just trying to warn people.
[1:34:56.600 --> 1:34:58.600]  Oh, my gosh, sensitive subjects.
[1:34:58.600 --> 1:35:00.600]  You put it out a few days ago.
[1:35:00.600 --> 1:35:02.600]  How dare you try to talk to people?
[1:35:02.600 --> 1:35:04.600]  We can't let you talk.
[1:35:04.600 --> 1:35:06.600]  Well, it's a sensitive subject.
[1:35:06.600 --> 1:35:08.600]  We'll get your video. I haven't seen it yet,
[1:35:08.600 --> 1:35:10.600]  but you can find it on YouTube
[1:35:10.600 --> 1:35:12.600]  at infowars.com.
[1:35:12.600 --> 1:35:14.600]  Yeah, that would be amazing.
[1:35:14.600 --> 1:35:16.600]  So, that brings me to what I was going to say is,
[1:35:16.600 --> 1:35:18.600]  you know, how contagious, you know,
[1:35:18.600 --> 1:35:20.600]  the courage can be, you know,
[1:35:20.600 --> 1:35:22.600]  coming out and speaking out against all this stuff
[1:35:22.600 --> 1:35:24.600]  because, like, someone like you
[1:35:24.600 --> 1:35:26.600]  is who inspires me,
[1:35:26.600 --> 1:35:28.600]  and then who knows who I can inspire,
[1:35:28.600 --> 1:35:30.600]  you know, and that ties back into
[1:35:30.600 --> 1:35:32.600]  what you were talking about earlier.
[1:35:32.600 --> 1:35:34.600]  Like, this great reset, you know,
[1:35:34.600 --> 1:35:36.600]  it's here, man, and we just need
[1:35:36.600 --> 1:35:38.600]  to embrace it, you know,
[1:35:38.600 --> 1:35:40.600]  and just accept it, you know,
[1:35:40.600 --> 1:35:42.600]  and just keep one foot in front of the other
[1:35:42.600 --> 1:35:44.600]  and keep fighting. You know what I'm saying?
[1:35:44.600 --> 1:35:46.600]  No, I agree. Not embrace it as if we give into it,
[1:35:46.600 --> 1:35:48.600]  but embrace we're in a fight
[1:35:48.600 --> 1:35:50.600]  and just deal with the fact we're in it
[1:35:50.600 --> 1:35:52.600]  and admit it to ourselves.
[1:35:52.600 --> 1:35:54.600]  Yes, absolutely, absolutely.
[1:35:54.600 --> 1:35:56.600]  So, tell me about your song, Everything,
[1:35:56.600 --> 1:35:58.600]  Alec.
[1:35:58.600 --> 1:36:00.600]  So, yeah, so, pretty much I tell it
[1:36:00.600 --> 1:36:02.600]  from two different perspectives.
[1:36:02.600 --> 1:36:04.600]  The first verse is my perspective
[1:36:04.600 --> 1:36:06.600]  of what's coming, you know,
[1:36:06.600 --> 1:36:08.600]  the collapse is coming, blah, blah, blah,
[1:36:08.600 --> 1:36:10.600]  and how I'm trying to warn people
[1:36:10.600 --> 1:36:12.600]  and there's a video to kind of narrate
[1:36:12.600 --> 1:36:14.600]  and go along with it.
[1:36:14.600 --> 1:36:16.600]  And then the second verse is somebody else
[1:36:16.600 --> 1:36:18.600]  who is pretty much the
[1:36:18.600 --> 1:36:20.600]  receiver of my message, but they didn't
[1:36:20.600 --> 1:36:22.600]  listen to me. Like, I try to tell them the collapse
[1:36:22.600 --> 1:36:24.600]  is coming, get prepared, blah, blah, blah,
[1:36:24.600 --> 1:36:26.600]  and then here it is, you know,
[1:36:26.600 --> 1:36:28.600]  inflation, gas prices, food shortages,
[1:36:28.600 --> 1:36:30.600]  all that, and it's just
[1:36:30.600 --> 1:36:32.600]  pretty much them coming
[1:36:32.600 --> 1:36:34.600]  from the realization that, hey,
[1:36:34.600 --> 1:36:36.600]  you know, these people that were trying to warn me
[1:36:36.600 --> 1:36:38.600]  were right, and I shouldn't have
[1:36:38.600 --> 1:36:40.600]  looked at them in the negative light that I looked
[1:36:40.600 --> 1:36:42.600]  at them, you know what I mean?
[1:36:42.600 --> 1:36:44.600]  Well, I'm seeing your video, it looks really interesting,
[1:36:44.600 --> 1:36:46.600]  we're going to check it out, but regardless,
[1:36:46.600 --> 1:36:48.600]  your spirit of them
[1:36:48.600 --> 1:36:50.600]  suppressing your video, telling you
[1:36:50.600 --> 1:36:52.600]  you couldn't promote it, blocking it,
[1:36:52.600 --> 1:36:54.600]  and then getting into the show
[1:36:54.600 --> 1:36:56.600]  and promoting it, that spirit of not
[1:36:56.600 --> 1:36:58.600]  giving in to censorship and overpowering
[1:36:58.600 --> 1:37:00.600]  it is the answer, brother, and that's beautiful.
[1:37:00.600 --> 1:37:02.600]  Thank you so much, Alec.
[1:37:02.600 --> 1:37:04.600]  All right, let's take another call here.
[1:37:04.600 --> 1:37:06.600]  In the order they are received,
[1:37:06.600 --> 1:37:08.600]  let's talk to
[1:37:08.600 --> 1:37:10.600]  a caller in New Jersey,
[1:37:10.600 --> 1:37:12.600]  let's talk to Jonathan in New Jersey,
[1:37:12.600 --> 1:37:14.600]  the economic war and the great reset we're under,
[1:37:14.600 --> 1:37:16.600]  go ahead.
[1:37:18.600 --> 1:37:20.600]  Hi, Alex, it's actually Jordan.
[1:37:20.600 --> 1:37:22.600]  Oh, sorry, I misread it, go ahead.
[1:37:22.600 --> 1:37:24.600]  Okay, so
[1:37:24.600 --> 1:37:26.600]  I just want to call and tie this
[1:37:26.600 --> 1:37:28.600]  into the, you know,
[1:37:28.600 --> 1:37:30.600]  the vaccine death shot,
[1:37:30.600 --> 1:37:32.600]  death shot and also control shot.
[1:37:32.600 --> 1:37:34.600]  You might remember me,
[1:37:34.600 --> 1:37:36.600]  I'm actually currently
[1:37:36.600 --> 1:37:38.600]  cataloged under
[1:37:38.600 --> 1:37:40.600]  Bandot video under
[1:37:40.600 --> 1:37:42.600]  May 27, 2021, former pharmaceutical
[1:37:42.600 --> 1:37:44.600]  representative warms the vaccine ingredients.
[1:37:44.600 --> 1:37:46.600]  I still stand by those
[1:37:46.600 --> 1:37:48.600]  comments, and I also
[1:37:48.600 --> 1:37:50.600]  talk to you in September of last year
[1:37:50.600 --> 1:37:52.600]  about the Japanese
[1:37:52.600 --> 1:37:54.600]  revelations.
[1:37:54.600 --> 1:37:56.600]  You're not just vindicated, I remember your call,
[1:37:56.600 --> 1:37:58.600]  it's all confirmed now,
[1:37:58.600 --> 1:38:00.600]  the British Medical Journal.
[1:38:00.600 --> 1:38:02.600]  Yes, and
[1:38:02.600 --> 1:38:04.600]  this is where I'd like to go,
[1:38:04.600 --> 1:38:06.600]  and, you know, Jay Dyer
[1:38:06.600 --> 1:38:08.600]  talked about this and ties into
[1:38:08.600 --> 1:38:10.600]  what Bill Joy had talked about, about the future
[1:38:10.600 --> 1:38:12.600]  doesn't need us, right?
[1:38:12.600 --> 1:38:14.600]  And there was some decision amongst the elite
[1:38:14.600 --> 1:38:16.600]  that they don't need humanity anymore
[1:38:16.600 --> 1:38:18.600]  and we don't really need to know,
[1:38:18.600 --> 1:38:20.600]  do these people, right?
[1:38:20.600 --> 1:38:22.600]  And so, you know, part of what this all is
[1:38:22.600 --> 1:38:24.600]  is that there is this fourth turning
[1:38:24.600 --> 1:38:26.600]  step that they know about the rise and fall
[1:38:26.600 --> 1:38:28.600]  of these civilizations, and they pump
[1:38:28.600 --> 1:38:30.600]  this civilization up, way beyond
[1:38:30.600 --> 1:38:32.600]  it could ever have ever been attained
[1:38:32.600 --> 1:38:34.600]  normally. And if you look at the general public
[1:38:34.600 --> 1:38:36.600]  myself included, they look like a bunch of
[1:38:36.600 --> 1:38:38.600]  zombie slobs, but the globalists are just as bad.
[1:38:38.600 --> 1:38:40.600]  So you don't have a right to kill all these
[1:38:40.600 --> 1:38:42.600]  people, instead of leading them and inspiring
[1:38:42.600 --> 1:38:44.600]  them, they've decided to dumb them down
[1:38:44.600 --> 1:38:46.600]  as much as possible so they're not players
[1:38:46.600 --> 1:38:48.600]  and then just get rid of them.
[1:38:48.600 --> 1:38:50.600]  Yes, and control them,
[1:38:50.600 --> 1:38:52.600]  they want full control, so anybody
[1:38:52.600 --> 1:38:54.600]  who doesn't live through this process,
[1:38:54.600 --> 1:38:56.600]  okay, people will die, and they are
[1:38:56.600 --> 1:38:58.600]  dying, but that's not their only goal.
[1:38:58.600 --> 1:39:00.600]  Their goal is to achieve this transhumanist
[1:39:00.600 --> 1:39:02.600]  mean. Now the question becomes
[1:39:02.600 --> 1:39:04.600]  what have they called the aporetics?
[1:39:04.600 --> 1:39:06.600]  What have they told the AOC?
[1:39:06.600 --> 1:39:08.600]  What have they told these lower echelons
[1:39:08.600 --> 1:39:10.600]  people to use? We know they've told them to the
[1:39:10.600 --> 1:39:12.600]  end of the world's coming and they've got to get
[1:39:12.600 --> 1:39:14.600]  positioned to save themselves, and so that's
[1:39:14.600 --> 1:39:16.600]  why they're so scared and go along with the agenda.
[1:39:16.600 --> 1:39:18.600]  But what is that? We still haven't
[1:39:18.600 --> 1:39:20.600]  found that out, and that's why we do
[1:39:20.600 --> 1:39:22.600]  it. They say the carrying capacity
[1:39:22.600 --> 1:39:24.600]  of the earth is over, and the world will collapse
[1:39:24.600 --> 1:39:26.600]  and deadly viruses will come out of the jungle
[1:39:26.600 --> 1:39:28.600]  and kill everybody. They're really going to come out
[1:39:28.600 --> 1:39:30.600]  of labs and they've prepared the whole thing,
[1:39:30.600 --> 1:39:32.600]  so they pretty much told us, you see them
[1:39:32.600 --> 1:39:34.600]  telling you everywhere.
[1:39:34.600 --> 1:39:36.600]  What do they tell them though, that they're
[1:39:36.600 --> 1:39:38.600]  going to be saved? That if they do what they're
[1:39:38.600 --> 1:39:40.600]  told, they'll be saved? Is that what they've told them?
[1:39:40.600 --> 1:39:42.600]  That is exactly what they've told them.
[1:39:42.600 --> 1:39:44.600]  Okay, so there's
[1:39:44.600 --> 1:39:46.600]  some other plan that these people are following,
[1:39:46.600 --> 1:39:48.600]  the core of which
[1:39:48.600 --> 1:39:50.600]  we need to find out, but the economic
[1:39:50.600 --> 1:39:52.600]  warfare is very important because
[1:39:52.600 --> 1:39:54.600]  we can see out of it, right?
[1:39:54.600 --> 1:39:56.600]  So that they can implement whatever it is.
[1:39:56.600 --> 1:39:58.600]  They want to take the fourth turning that's
[1:39:58.600 --> 1:40:00.600]  occurring and then take a giant leap,
[1:40:00.600 --> 1:40:02.600]  like Harari said,
[1:40:02.600 --> 1:40:04.600]  in evolution.
[1:40:04.600 --> 1:40:06.600]  To counter man
[1:40:06.600 --> 1:40:08.600]  this rise and fall of civilization
[1:40:08.600 --> 1:40:10.600]  and humanity.
[1:40:10.600 --> 1:40:12.600]  They want to use humanity and all of our
[1:40:12.600 --> 1:40:14.600]  knowledge and skill to build a breakaway
[1:40:14.600 --> 1:40:16.600]  civilization while they implode us
[1:40:16.600 --> 1:40:18.600]  and kill us.
[1:40:18.600 --> 1:40:20.600]  Correct, and to keep that larger
[1:40:20.600 --> 1:40:22.600]  theme up in mind and try to make
[1:40:22.600 --> 1:40:24.600]  that palatable, I think is what
[1:40:24.600 --> 1:40:26.600]  one of your main missions is, and
[1:40:26.600 --> 1:40:28.600]  I've been championing that, and I've been trying
[1:40:28.600 --> 1:40:30.600]  to call and using my knowledge to try to
[1:40:30.600 --> 1:40:32.600]  circuit through you
[1:40:32.600 --> 1:40:34.600]  and create a bed of
[1:40:34.600 --> 1:40:36.600]  knowledge and just a lightning rod
[1:40:36.600 --> 1:40:38.600]  for people to try to come
[1:40:38.600 --> 1:40:40.600]  to terms with it and think about what
[1:40:40.600 --> 1:40:42.600]  breakaway civilization are we going to form?
[1:40:42.600 --> 1:40:44.600]  That's right, they are a bunch of
[1:40:44.600 --> 1:40:46.600]  wicked, selfish,
[1:40:46.600 --> 1:40:48.600]  delusional control freaks that believe
[1:40:48.600 --> 1:40:50.600]  they've been given the birthright
[1:40:50.600 --> 1:40:52.600]  and the deed of the future and they haven't.
[1:40:52.600 --> 1:40:54.600]  So if we're aware of the fact they're doing this
[1:40:54.600 --> 1:40:56.600]  with their great reset build back better
[1:40:56.600 --> 1:40:58.600]  and we build a coalition against it and people
[1:40:58.600 --> 1:41:00.600]  discussing the future and advanced
[1:41:00.600 --> 1:41:02.600]  technology and cloning and gene editing
[1:41:02.600 --> 1:41:04.600]  to have a real debate about it, we will then
[1:41:04.600 --> 1:41:06.600]  be active players in the decision making
[1:41:06.600 --> 1:41:08.600]  process and not just chattel animals.
[1:41:08.600 --> 1:41:10.600]  But they see us as animals
[1:41:10.600 --> 1:41:12.600]  if you cannot address them and figure
[1:41:12.600 --> 1:41:14.600]  out what they're doing and oppose them.
[1:41:14.600 --> 1:41:16.600]  The globalist respect me,
[1:41:16.600 --> 1:41:18.600]  they respect you
[1:41:18.600 --> 1:41:20.600]  Jordan, because
[1:41:20.600 --> 1:41:22.600]  they know you're aware of this stuff.
[1:41:22.600 --> 1:41:24.600]  If you're not even aware of it,
[1:41:24.600 --> 1:41:26.600]  you're not even on the playing field, you don't even count.
[1:41:28.600 --> 1:41:30.600]  No, but you've given us all an opportunity
[1:41:30.600 --> 1:41:32.600]  and I appreciate that. I know you're under a lot
[1:41:32.600 --> 1:41:34.600]  of pressure and I'm doing everything I can.
[1:41:34.600 --> 1:41:36.600]  I will be launching a website
[1:41:36.600 --> 1:41:38.600]  to catalog my research as Owen
[1:41:38.600 --> 1:41:40.600]  Schroyer says on that May 27th
[1:41:40.600 --> 1:41:42.600]  2021
[1:41:42.600 --> 1:41:44.600]  recording
[1:41:44.600 --> 1:41:46.600]  where I was on the war room with him
[1:41:46.600 --> 1:41:48.600]  and I followed up with you later
[1:41:48.600 --> 1:41:50.600]  the next year I believe
[1:41:50.600 --> 1:41:52.600]  or later that year, excuse me, that September
[1:41:52.600 --> 1:41:54.600]  where I will be cataloging what their plan
[1:41:54.600 --> 1:41:56.600]  is because the motive
[1:41:56.600 --> 1:41:58.600]  control is very important that we understand.
[1:41:58.600 --> 1:42:00.600]  It's cut off the resources, make us go
[1:42:00.600 --> 1:42:02.600]  through a digital social credit score
[1:42:02.600 --> 1:42:04.600]  carbon tax which has total behavioral
[1:42:04.600 --> 1:42:06.600]  control and live time surveillance
[1:42:06.600 --> 1:42:08.600]  hard coded into all civilization
[1:42:08.600 --> 1:42:10.600]  a whole new system they're building
[1:42:10.600 --> 1:42:12.600]  which is then a post humanist system
[1:42:12.600 --> 1:42:14.600]  so complying with it is not
[1:42:14.600 --> 1:42:16.600]  empowering you, it destroys you including
[1:42:16.600 --> 1:42:18.600]  those that are serving and who believe they're going to become gods
[1:42:18.600 --> 1:42:20.600]  portraying humanity but anybody
[1:42:20.600 --> 1:42:22.600]  that knows about how this works knows that
[1:42:22.600 --> 1:42:24.600]  the betrayers, the
[1:42:24.600 --> 1:42:26.600]  traders, the first people
[1:42:26.600 --> 1:42:28.600]  that the real controllers will get rid of. Thank you so much
[1:42:28.600 --> 1:42:30.600]  Jordan. We're going to go to
[1:42:30.600 --> 1:42:32.600]  break. We're going to come back
[1:42:32.600 --> 1:42:34.600]  with Tyler
[1:42:34.600 --> 1:42:36.600]  and with Brian and with Robert and Eric
[1:42:36.600 --> 1:42:38.600]  and Joe and DJ and Josh
[1:42:38.600 --> 1:42:40.600]  and others. Bam, bam, bam
[1:42:40.600 --> 1:42:42.600]  your calls on this live
[1:42:42.600 --> 1:42:44.600]  Thursday broadcast that wasn't
[1:42:44.600 --> 1:42:46.600]  even supposed to exist. We were
[1:42:46.600 --> 1:42:48.600]  supposed to be off air by now
[1:42:48.600 --> 1:42:50.600]  they could be carrying all this out. They're so frustrated
[1:42:50.600 --> 1:42:52.600]  they're so upset they're not god
[1:42:52.600 --> 1:42:54.600]  they will be defeated.
[1:42:56.600 --> 1:42:58.600]  At this point
[1:42:58.600 --> 1:43:00.600]  best case scenario
[1:43:00.600 --> 1:43:02.600]  is a few years of hard times
[1:43:02.600 --> 1:43:04.600]  for us all and if we don't
[1:43:04.600 --> 1:43:06.600]  turn it around soon then it will only
[1:43:06.600 --> 1:43:08.600]  get worse.
[1:43:08.600 --> 1:43:10.600]  But as bad as things are
[1:43:10.600 --> 1:43:12.600]  we still have time to prepare
[1:43:12.600 --> 1:43:14.600]  and that alone is something to be grateful
[1:43:14.600 --> 1:43:16.600]  for. A gravity water
[1:43:16.600 --> 1:43:18.600]  filter will provide you with clean
[1:43:18.600 --> 1:43:20.600]  healthy water even in the
[1:43:20.600 --> 1:43:22.600]  event of your taps getting shut off
[1:43:22.600 --> 1:43:24.600]  and having your own food
[1:43:24.600 --> 1:43:26.600]  will save you from getting ensnared
[1:43:26.600 --> 1:43:28.600]  in government FEMA camps
[1:43:28.600 --> 1:43:30.600]  and if you've already stocked up enough
[1:43:30.600 --> 1:43:32.600]  for your own family you might
[1:43:32.600 --> 1:43:34.600]  want to consider stocking up
[1:43:34.600 --> 1:43:36.600]  for your neighbors.
[1:43:36.600 --> 1:43:38.600]  Some of your neighbors might not be
[1:43:38.600 --> 1:43:40.600]  prepared for what's coming
[1:43:40.600 --> 1:43:42.600]  but you can help them by having
[1:43:42.600 --> 1:43:44.600]  an abundance of storable foods
[1:43:44.600 --> 1:43:46.600]  and water filtration.
[1:43:46.600 --> 1:43:48.600]  Whoever sews bountifully

[1:44:56.600 --> 1:44:58.600]  with just one word
[1:44:58.600 --> 1:45:00.600]  the brainwashing
[1:45:00.600 --> 1:45:02.600]  the mind control
[1:45:02.600 --> 1:45:04.600]  the asleep prance
[1:45:04.600 --> 1:45:06.600]  for the general public
[1:45:06.600 --> 1:45:08.600]  is in
[1:45:08.600 --> 1:45:10.600]  the best word would actually be
[1:45:10.600 --> 1:45:12.600]  the people are lost
[1:45:12.600 --> 1:45:14.600]  just like you're lost to sleep
[1:45:14.600 --> 1:45:16.600]  or lost in a
[1:45:16.600 --> 1:45:18.600]  bad nightmare
[1:45:18.600 --> 1:45:20.600]  or you're in a car or you get knocked out
[1:45:20.600 --> 1:45:22.600]  and you've lost
[1:45:22.600 --> 1:45:24.600]  your bearings because
[1:45:24.600 --> 1:45:26.600]  you are totally
[1:45:26.600 --> 1:45:28.600]  dizzy and confused you have a concussion
[1:45:28.600 --> 1:45:30.600]  and that's what the globalists have done
[1:45:30.600 --> 1:45:32.600]  they have stunned us
[1:45:32.600 --> 1:45:34.600]  they have put us into a position
[1:45:34.600 --> 1:45:36.600]  of not knowing our bearings
[1:45:36.600 --> 1:45:38.600]  and then Klaus Schwab recently came out and gave a speech
[1:45:38.600 --> 1:45:40.600]  called The Great New Narrative
[1:45:40.600 --> 1:45:42.600]  where he brags how the public is lost
[1:45:42.600 --> 1:45:44.600]  how the culture and the media
[1:45:44.600 --> 1:45:46.600]  has been driven to make sure the people are all alone
[1:45:46.600 --> 1:45:48.600]  so they can now guide humanity
[1:45:48.600 --> 1:45:50.600]  over the edge of a cliff
[1:45:50.600 --> 1:45:52.600]  that's what The Great Recent is
[1:45:52.600 --> 1:45:54.600]  they need darkness to thrive
[1:45:54.600 --> 1:45:56.600]  the light lives at
[1:45:56.600 --> 1:45:58.600]  nfowars.com
[1:45:58.600 --> 1:46:00.600]  look at that
[1:46:00.600 --> 1:46:02.600]  everybody else is just like yellow or clear
[1:46:02.600 --> 1:46:04.600]  that's because it's been denatured
[1:46:04.600 --> 1:46:06.600]  it's been worked out we didn't do that
[1:46:06.600 --> 1:46:08.600]  you think I would
[1:46:08.600 --> 1:46:10.600]  metaphysically tell you something
[1:46:10.600 --> 1:46:12.600]  this is the very best I can get
[1:46:12.600 --> 1:46:14.600]  I'd rather go to hell and do that
[1:46:14.600 --> 1:46:16.600]  so the maximum truth
[1:46:16.600 --> 1:46:18.600]  the maximum product because
[1:46:18.600 --> 1:46:20.600]  I want that good will
[1:46:20.600 --> 1:46:22.600]  what I do to you I do to myself

[1:46:26.600 --> 1:46:28.600]  fish oil look like that no you never seen that have you
[1:46:28.600 --> 1:46:30.600]  and this little jewel right here
[1:46:30.600 --> 1:46:32.600]  is solid
[1:46:34.600 --> 1:46:36.600]  liquid consciousness
[1:46:38.600 --> 1:46:40.600]  look it up
[1:46:40.600 --> 1:46:42.600]  find out
[1:46:42.600 --> 1:46:44.600]  how even the FDA
[1:46:44.600 --> 1:46:46.600]  and the government admits fish oil is incredible
[1:46:46.600 --> 1:46:48.600]  the number one thing anybody can do for themselves
[1:46:48.600 --> 1:46:50.600]  is take good
[1:46:50.600 --> 1:46:52.600]  fish oil or krill oil
[1:46:52.600 --> 1:46:54.600]  just like our information is dynamite so are our products
[1:46:54.600 --> 1:46:56.600]  nfowars.com
[1:46:58.600 --> 1:47:00.600]  leading a frontal assault
[1:47:00.600 --> 1:47:02.600]  on the lies of the new world order
[1:47:02.600 --> 1:47:04.600]  it's Alex Jones
[1:47:08.600 --> 1:47:10.600]  that's what Americans do now
[1:47:10.600 --> 1:47:12.600]  to trade away a little of their freedom
[1:47:12.600 --> 1:47:14.600]  in exchange for the feeling
[1:47:14.600 --> 1:47:16.600]  the illusion of security
[1:47:16.600 --> 1:47:18.600]  what we have now is a
[1:47:18.600 --> 1:47:20.600]  completely neurotic population
[1:47:20.600 --> 1:47:22.600]  obsessed with security
[1:47:22.600 --> 1:47:24.600]  and safety and crime
[1:47:24.600 --> 1:47:26.600]  and drugs and cleanliness and hygiene
[1:47:26.600 --> 1:47:28.600]  and germs there's another thing
[1:47:28.600 --> 1:47:30.600]  germs where did this
[1:47:30.600 --> 1:47:32.600]  sudden fear of germs come from
[1:47:32.600 --> 1:47:34.600]  in this country have you noticed this
[1:47:34.600 --> 1:47:36.600]  the media constantly running stories
[1:47:36.600 --> 1:47:38.600]  about all the latest infections
[1:47:38.600 --> 1:47:40.600]  salmonella E. coli
[1:47:40.600 --> 1:47:42.600]  antivirus bird flu
[1:47:42.600 --> 1:47:44.600]  and Americans are they panic easily
[1:47:44.600 --> 1:47:46.600]  so now everybody's running around scrubbing this
[1:47:46.600 --> 1:47:48.600]  and spraying that and overcooking their food
[1:47:48.600 --> 1:47:50.600]  and repeatedly washing their hands
[1:47:50.600 --> 1:47:52.600]  trying to avoid all contact with germs
[1:47:52.600 --> 1:47:54.600]  it's ridiculous and it goes
[1:47:54.600 --> 1:47:56.600]  to ridiculous lengths
[1:47:56.600 --> 1:47:58.600]  fear of germs why these f***ing f***ies

[1:48:06.600 --> 1:48:08.600]  you have an immune system for
[1:48:08.600 --> 1:48:10.600]  it's for killing germs
[1:48:10.600 --> 1:48:12.600]  but it needs practice it needs
[1:48:12.600 --> 1:48:14.600]  germs to practice on
[1:48:14.600 --> 1:48:16.600]  so

[1:48:24.600 --> 1:48:26.600]  sterile life then when germs do come
[1:48:26.600 --> 1:48:28.600]  along you're not gonna be prepared
[1:48:28.600 --> 1:48:30.600]  and never mind ordinary germs what are you
[1:48:30.600 --> 1:48:32.600]  gonna do when some super virus comes

[1:48:42.600 --> 1:48:44.600]  weak immune system
[1:48:44.600 --> 1:48:46.600]  now
[1:48:48.600 --> 1:48:50.600]  hey
[1:48:50.600 --> 1:48:52.600]  let me tell you a true story about
[1:48:52.600 --> 1:48:54.600]  immunization okay when I was a little boy
[1:48:54.600 --> 1:48:56.600]  in New York City in the 1940s
[1:48:56.600 --> 1:48:58.600]  we swam in the Hudson River
[1:48:58.600 --> 1:49:00.600]  and it was filled with raw sewage
[1:49:00.600 --> 1:49:02.600]  okay we swam
[1:49:02.600 --> 1:49:04.600]  in raw sewage
[1:49:04.600 --> 1:49:06.600]  to cool off
[1:49:06.600 --> 1:49:08.600]  and at that time the big fear
[1:49:08.600 --> 1:49:10.600]  was polio thousands of kids
[1:49:10.600 --> 1:49:12.600]  died from polio every year but you know
[1:49:12.600 --> 1:49:14.600]  something in my neighborhood no one ever got
[1:49:14.600 --> 1:49:16.600]  polio no one ever
[1:49:16.600 --> 1:49:18.600]  you know why cause we swam in raw
[1:49:18.600 --> 1:49:20.600]  sewage
[1:49:20.600 --> 1:49:22.600]  it sprinkled our immune systems
[1:49:22.600 --> 1:49:24.600]  the polio never had a prayer
[1:49:24.600 --> 1:49:26.600]  we were tempered in raw
[1:49:26.600 --> 1:49:28.600]  s***
[1:49:28.600 --> 1:49:30.600]  you tell
[1:49:30.600 --> 1:49:32.600]  I'm George Tarnall and Alex Jones here
[1:49:32.600 --> 1:49:34.600]  back live
[1:49:34.600 --> 1:49:36.600]  wow that was powerful
[1:49:36.600 --> 1:49:38.600]  we're gonna go back to your calls
[1:49:38.600 --> 1:49:40.600]  and I'll continue with calls the next hour
[1:49:40.600 --> 1:49:42.600]  but I'm gonna hit the other second amendment
[1:49:42.600 --> 1:49:44.600]  there is and uvaldi
[1:49:44.600 --> 1:49:46.600]  because
[1:49:46.600 --> 1:49:48.600]  I don't wanna say I dropped the ball on uvaldi
[1:49:48.600 --> 1:49:50.600]  but it's just hard
[1:49:50.600 --> 1:49:52.600]  to believe that all these things
[1:49:52.600 --> 1:49:54.600]  are total lies
[1:49:54.600 --> 1:49:56.600]  and they admit the whole things alive the head of the state police says
[1:49:56.600 --> 1:49:58.600]  everything's alive they don't even know what happened
[1:49:58.600 --> 1:50:00.600]  don't know what happened
[1:50:00.600 --> 1:50:02.600]  19 dead children 2 dead teachers
[1:50:02.600 --> 1:50:04.600]  were told and and everything's a lie
[1:50:04.600 --> 1:50:06.600]  so it's completely reasonable to say you don't believe
[1:50:06.600 --> 1:50:08.600]  any of it oh but you'll get sued
[1:50:08.600 --> 1:50:10.600]  if you say that you're not supposed to ask
[1:50:10.600 --> 1:50:12.600]  any of those questions right
[1:50:12.600 --> 1:50:14.600]  well we'll keep asking those questions and I'm gonna go to uvaldi now
[1:50:14.600 --> 1:50:16.600]  I'm just gonna talk to people

[1:50:20.600 --> 1:50:22.600]  why don't they want
[1:50:22.600 --> 1:50:24.600]  us questioning
[1:50:24.600 --> 1:50:26.600]  why don't they want us to have platforms to question
[1:50:26.600 --> 1:50:28.600]  why are they so scared of them for us
[1:50:28.600 --> 1:50:30.600]  we're going back to your calls and we'll just say this

[1:51:10.600 --> 1:51:12.600]  and it's only to go up anyways
[1:51:12.600 --> 1:51:14.600]  so even if you waited or didn't do it
[1:51:14.600 --> 1:51:16.600]  now is the time to stop procrastinating
[1:51:16.600 --> 1:51:18.600]  preparewithalix.com and be smart
[1:51:18.600 --> 1:51:20.600]  separately
[1:51:20.600 --> 1:51:22.600]  hold back items for people that sign up for auto
[1:51:22.600 --> 1:51:24.600]  ship with the initial 10% off
[1:51:24.600 --> 1:51:26.600]  and they overheld some stuff
[1:51:26.600 --> 1:51:28.600]  so it's coming back in late July
[1:51:28.600 --> 1:51:30.600]  they think vitamin mineral fusion one of our bestselling
[1:51:30.600 --> 1:51:32.600]  products high quality vitamins, minerals, amino acids
[1:51:32.600 --> 1:51:34.600]  so tasty so great for children
[1:51:34.600 --> 1:51:36.600]  adults you name it put a scoop of it
[1:51:36.600 --> 1:51:38.600]  in water and some ice tastes amazing
[1:51:38.600 --> 1:51:40.600]  that's so many great things because it's liquid
[1:51:40.600 --> 1:51:42.600]  you absorb a lot more with the pills
[1:51:42.600 --> 1:51:44.600]  even their high quality
[1:51:44.600 --> 1:51:46.600]  we found 1100 bottles of that
[1:51:46.600 --> 1:51:48.600]  that because of a miscalculation
[1:51:48.600 --> 1:51:50.600]  with auto ship we had
[1:51:50.600 --> 1:51:52.600]  it'll sell out probably today
[1:51:52.600 --> 1:51:54.600]  it's available at infowarstore.com as well
[1:51:54.600 --> 1:51:56.600]  by calling toll free
[1:51:56.600 --> 1:51:58.600]  triple A 253-3139
[1:51:58.600 --> 1:52:00.600]  and despite the fact that it'll sell out today
[1:52:00.600 --> 1:52:02.600]  it's still 25% off
[1:52:02.600 --> 1:52:04.600]  and I'm going to stop right there now
[1:52:04.600 --> 1:52:06.600]  and I'm going to move back to your phone calls
[1:52:06.600 --> 1:52:08.600]  other than saying this
[1:52:08.600 --> 1:52:10.600]  I talked to the next to citizens of four weeks ago
[1:52:10.600 --> 1:52:12.600]  five weeks ago with I think the most important
[1:52:12.600 --> 1:52:14.600]  documentary ever proving that they stole the election
[1:52:14.600 --> 1:52:16.600]  and I said I bet all by
[1:52:16.600 --> 1:52:18.600]  100,000 DVDs from you
[1:52:18.600 --> 1:52:20.600]  because people want to have it in their archive
[1:52:20.600 --> 1:52:22.600]  and it's such a historic film
[1:52:22.600 --> 1:52:24.600]  and we bought 20,000 and I said I think we'll be
[1:52:24.600 --> 1:52:26.600]  reordering it every few weeks
[1:52:26.600 --> 1:52:28.600]  we've only sold out half of these
[1:52:28.600 --> 1:52:30.600]  and I'm not mad at the audience
[1:52:30.600 --> 1:52:32.600]  I just think you're crazy
[1:52:32.600 --> 1:52:34.600]  with all the censorship online what's happening
[1:52:34.600 --> 1:52:36.600]  you need this historic film on your shelf
[1:52:36.600 --> 1:52:38.600]  to show friends, family, neighbors
[1:52:38.600 --> 1:52:40.600]  your office, your boss, your employees
[1:52:40.600 --> 1:52:42.600]  your church, whoever
[1:52:42.600 --> 1:52:44.600]  and so we have it we have cobaland 3
[1:52:44.600 --> 1:52:46.600]  and how deadly the shot is
[1:52:46.600 --> 1:52:48.600]  both those are discounted together
[1:52:48.600 --> 1:52:50.600]  but everybody needs them
[1:52:50.600 --> 1:52:52.600]  infowarstore.com
[1:52:52.600 --> 1:52:54.600]  and I'll be quite frank I'm surprised
[1:52:54.600 --> 1:52:56.600]  more people haven't got it
[1:52:56.600 --> 1:52:58.600]  I think you're crazy when you're over on the site
[1:52:58.600 --> 1:53:00.600]  getting other products and I'll get this
[1:53:00.600 --> 1:53:02.600]  and it keeps the show in the air
[1:53:02.600 --> 1:53:04.600]  infowarstore.com
[1:53:04.600 --> 1:53:06.600]  or AAA 253-3139
[1:53:06.600 --> 1:53:08.600]  okay
[1:53:08.600 --> 1:53:10.600]  who's been holding the longest
[1:53:10.600 --> 1:53:12.600]  now
[1:53:12.600 --> 1:53:14.600]  it's gonna be Joe in Florida
[1:53:14.600 --> 1:53:16.600]  Joe, welcome
[1:53:16.600 --> 1:53:18.600]  hey Alex
[1:53:18.600 --> 1:53:20.600]  go ahead
[1:53:20.600 --> 1:53:22.600]  great talking to you
[1:53:22.600 --> 1:53:24.600]  I love everything you do
[1:53:24.600 --> 1:53:26.600]  I just don't even want to imagine where we'd be without you
[1:53:26.600 --> 1:53:28.600]  I wanted to
[1:53:28.600 --> 1:53:30.600]  I'm a horticultural scientist
[1:53:30.600 --> 1:53:32.600]  and I majored in
[1:53:32.600 --> 1:53:34.600]  I got my degree at University of Florida in horticultural science
[1:53:34.600 --> 1:53:36.600]  and there's this common misconception
[1:53:36.600 --> 1:53:38.600]  that
[1:53:38.600 --> 1:53:40.600]  I've heard
[1:53:40.600 --> 1:53:42.600]  oh and say that
[1:53:42.600 --> 1:53:44.600]  that there's
[1:53:44.600 --> 1:53:46.600]  a lot of the plants are lacking
[1:53:46.600 --> 1:53:48.600]  the nutrients that they used to have
[1:53:48.600 --> 1:53:50.600]  but the problem with that is that
[1:53:50.600 --> 1:53:52.600]  there's 16 essential plant nutrients
[1:53:52.600 --> 1:53:54.600]  and the plants use them
[1:53:54.600 --> 1:53:56.600]  they incorporate them into their structures
[1:53:56.600 --> 1:53:58.600]  and they use them for enzymatic
[1:53:58.600 --> 1:54:00.600]  functions and whatnot and so
[1:54:00.600 --> 1:54:02.600]  they can't grow without them and for example
[1:54:02.600 --> 1:54:04.600]  copper
[1:54:04.600 --> 1:54:06.600]  the plant needs 200 times more nitrogen
[1:54:06.600 --> 1:54:08.600]  than it needs copper but still
[1:54:08.600 --> 1:54:10.600]  lacks the copper
[1:54:10.600 --> 1:54:12.600]  the little teeny bit of copper that it needs
[1:54:12.600 --> 1:54:14.600]  it can't grow at all
[1:54:14.600 --> 1:54:16.600]  it's lacking any trace element it can't grow
[1:54:16.600 --> 1:54:18.600]  just like humans
[1:54:18.600 --> 1:54:20.600]  exactly and we actually use the same
[1:54:20.600 --> 1:54:22.600]  essential nutrients as plants
[1:54:22.600 --> 1:54:24.600]  now that's not to say
[1:54:24.600 --> 1:54:26.600]  I take
[1:54:26.600 --> 1:54:28.600]  X2 so it's not to say
[1:54:28.600 --> 1:54:30.600]  that you're gonna get as much iodine as you need
[1:54:30.600 --> 1:54:32.600]  most plants don't have
[1:54:32.600 --> 1:54:34.600]  they don't need much iodine
[1:54:34.600 --> 1:54:36.600]  seaweed needs a lot of iodine so seaweed is a great source of it
[1:54:36.600 --> 1:54:38.600]  you can take the bodies, the top brain
[1:54:38.600 --> 1:54:40.600]  down and out
[1:54:40.600 --> 1:54:42.600]  primal use
[1:54:42.600 --> 1:54:44.600]  vasobite
[1:54:44.600 --> 1:54:46.600]  they're all great
[1:54:46.600 --> 1:54:48.600]  so if the nutrients aren't in the soil
[1:54:48.600 --> 1:54:50.600]  there are some depleted soils from poor farming techniques
[1:54:50.600 --> 1:54:52.600]  but if they're not in the soil
[1:54:52.600 --> 1:54:54.600]  then they have to be added by fertilizers
[1:54:54.600 --> 1:54:56.600]  otherwise the plants won't grow
[1:54:56.600 --> 1:54:58.600]  and the study shows so many of the diseases are caused
[1:54:58.600 --> 1:55:00.600]  by
[1:55:00.600 --> 1:55:02.600]  deficiencies of any of these trace elements
[1:55:02.600 --> 1:55:04.600]  correct
[1:55:04.600 --> 1:55:06.600]  so that's a great reason to take the X2
[1:55:06.600 --> 1:55:08.600]  another thing I wanted to talk about
[1:55:08.600 --> 1:55:10.600]  it's really important as the
[1:55:10.600 --> 1:55:12.600]  climate lockdowns
[1:55:12.600 --> 1:55:14.600]  are seeming more and more inevitable
[1:55:14.600 --> 1:55:16.600]  there's this nebulous
[1:55:16.600 --> 1:55:18.600]  ambiguous boogeyman of climate change
[1:55:18.600 --> 1:55:20.600]  they're using now
[1:55:20.600 --> 1:55:22.600]  and they don't want to call it global warming
[1:55:22.600 --> 1:55:24.600]  they know that that's been disproven
[1:55:24.600 --> 1:55:26.600]  they used to talk about global cooling
[1:55:26.600 --> 1:55:28.600]  but right now we're
[1:55:28.600 --> 1:55:30.600]  approaching the end of an 11 year solar cycle
[1:55:30.600 --> 1:55:32.600]  in which the sun
[1:55:32.600 --> 1:55:34.600]  flips its polarity like a magnet
[1:55:34.600 --> 1:55:36.600]  as a north and south
[1:55:36.600 --> 1:55:38.600]  at the end of that
[1:55:38.600 --> 1:55:40.600]  11 year cycle the sun is
[1:55:40.600 --> 1:55:42.600]  active as it's going to get
[1:55:42.600 --> 1:55:44.600]  and there's more sunspots and solar flares
[1:55:44.600 --> 1:55:46.600]  that's basically getting hotter
[1:55:46.600 --> 1:55:48.600]  we're supposed to be
[1:55:48.600 --> 1:55:50.600]  it was originally supposed to be around 2025
[1:55:50.600 --> 1:55:52.600]  but now scientists think that we're going to
[1:55:52.600 --> 1:55:54.600]  approach that closer to 2024
[1:55:54.600 --> 1:55:56.600]  but anyhow you can go outside
[1:55:56.600 --> 1:55:58.600]  and feel how bright the sun is on a bright day
[1:55:58.600 --> 1:56:00.600]  and actually if there was a greenhouse effect
[1:56:00.600 --> 1:56:02.600]  going on that was causing
[1:56:02.600 --> 1:56:04.600]  the globe to heat up
[1:56:04.600 --> 1:56:06.600]  the greenhouse effect
[1:56:06.600 --> 1:56:08.600]  that's right and all the real studies show
[1:56:08.600 --> 1:56:10.600]  the sun is the driver of climate
[1:56:10.600 --> 1:56:12.600]  not the gases we're putting into the air
[1:56:12.600 --> 1:56:14.600]  and the gases like methane and carbon dioxide
[1:56:14.600 --> 1:56:16.600]  is what the plants need
[1:56:16.600 --> 1:56:18.600]  what the earth needs
[1:56:18.600 --> 1:56:20.600]  what the atmosphere needs to sustain itself
[1:56:20.600 --> 1:56:22.600]  so the sun is heating up
[1:56:22.600 --> 1:56:24.600]  that's what's going to happen
[1:56:24.600 --> 1:56:26.600]  exactly and as a horticulturalist
[1:56:26.600 --> 1:56:28.600]  I used to
[1:56:28.600 --> 1:56:30.600]  in the cannabis industry and I was a head grower
[1:56:30.600 --> 1:56:32.600]  in New Jersey I'm from Florida originally
[1:56:32.600 --> 1:56:34.600]  but there we would use
[1:56:34.600 --> 1:56:36.600]  a thousand parts per million of CO2
[1:56:36.600 --> 1:56:38.600]  which is about three times higher
[1:56:38.600 --> 1:56:40.600]  than you'd find naturally
[1:56:40.600 --> 1:56:42.600]  let's explain that you would pump CO2
[1:56:42.600 --> 1:56:44.600]  into grow more bud
[1:56:44.600 --> 1:56:46.600]  exactly it would up the
[1:56:46.600 --> 1:56:48.600]  the level of growth by up to 150%
[1:56:48.600 --> 1:56:50.600]  and so
[1:56:50.600 --> 1:56:52.600]  that's a common thing
[1:56:52.600 --> 1:56:54.600]  so why would they be trying to block something so fundamental
[1:56:54.600 --> 1:56:56.600]  to life
[1:56:56.600 --> 1:56:58.600]  and you know actually
[1:56:58.600 --> 1:57:00.600]  I thought it was really funny
[1:57:00.600 --> 1:57:02.600]  and there is some truth to what you were saying
[1:57:02.600 --> 1:57:04.600]  about the weaponized marijuana
[1:57:04.600 --> 1:57:06.600]  I thought that was great
[1:57:06.600 --> 1:57:08.600]  also I want to talk about
[1:57:08.600 --> 1:57:10.600]  there's a lot of pseudo science
[1:57:10.600 --> 1:57:12.600]  out there that's really hurting kids
[1:57:12.600 --> 1:57:14.600]  interest in science
[1:57:14.600 --> 1:57:16.600]  you're a really smart caller Joe
[1:57:16.600 --> 1:57:18.600]  I'm going to air a clip of DeSantis for five minutes
[1:57:18.600 --> 1:57:20.600]  but if you'll hold until the next hour

[1:57:24.600 --> 1:57:26.600]  by the way it's not his opinion it's not my opinion
[1:57:26.600 --> 1:57:28.600]  they've done studies with
[1:57:28.600 --> 1:57:30.600]  triple quadruple CO2
[1:57:30.600 --> 1:57:32.600]  everything's healthier
[1:57:32.600 --> 1:57:34.600]  more oxygen the earth greens
[1:57:34.600 --> 1:57:36.600]  why are they attacking what makes the earth healthy
[1:57:36.600 --> 1:57:38.600]  this is an evil globalist operation
[1:57:38.600 --> 1:57:40.600]  they're not just trying to kill human life
[1:57:40.600 --> 1:57:42.600]  they want to terraform the whole planet
[1:57:42.600 --> 1:57:54.600]  and that's what they are
[1:58:12.600 --> 1:58:14.600]  we have a lot of amazing products on sale right now

[1:59:34.600 --> 1:59:36.600]  to show everyone you know
[1:59:36.600 --> 1:59:38.600]  we have the tools to bring these criminals to justice
[1:59:38.600 --> 1:59:40.600]  they're planning to run the same scams again
[1:59:40.600 --> 1:59:42.600]  this film can stop them if you take action
[1:59:42.600 --> 1:59:44.600]  infowarstore.com
[1:59:44.600 --> 1:59:46.600]  2,000 mules
[1:59:48.600 --> 1:59:50.600]  Leading a frontal assault
[1:59:50.600 --> 1:59:52.600]  on the lies of the New World Order
[1:59:52.600 --> 1:59:54.600]  it's Alex Jones
[2:00:02.600 --> 2:00:04.600]  well I don't normally play clip
[2:00:04.600 --> 2:00:06.600]  2 days in a row
[2:00:06.600 --> 2:00:08.600]  but this one with the sands
[2:00:08.600 --> 2:00:10.600]  is just so out of the park
[2:00:10.600 --> 2:00:12.600]  powerful
[2:00:12.600 --> 2:00:14.600]  I want to air it
[2:00:14.600 --> 2:00:16.600]  we'll come right back with your calls
[2:00:16.600 --> 2:00:18.600]  and a bunch of breaking news
[2:00:18.600 --> 2:00:20.600]  here it is
[2:00:20.600 --> 2:00:22.600]  there's obviously a lot of controversy
[2:00:22.600 --> 2:00:24.600]  at the end of last week
[2:00:24.600 --> 2:00:26.600]  between your administration and the White House
[2:00:26.600 --> 2:00:28.600]  what do you make of the White House
[2:00:28.600 --> 2:00:30.600]  saying the state reversed on child vaccines
[2:00:30.600 --> 2:00:32.600]  so the White House is lying about it
[2:00:32.600 --> 2:00:34.600]  we
[2:00:34.600 --> 2:00:36.600]  not surprise the White House for the lie
[2:00:36.600 --> 2:00:38.600]  definitely not surprise that
[2:00:38.600 --> 2:00:40.600]  the White House would amplify the lie
[2:00:40.600 --> 2:00:42.600]  because that's what they do
[2:00:42.600 --> 2:00:44.600]  the state of Florida
[2:00:44.600 --> 2:00:46.600]  the state of Florida has not ordered
[2:00:46.600 --> 2:00:48.600]  its department of health has not ordered
[2:00:48.600 --> 2:00:50.600]  mRNA jabs for the babies
[2:00:50.600 --> 2:00:52.600]  yes we didn't
[2:00:52.600 --> 2:00:54.600]  we recommend against it
[2:00:54.600 --> 2:00:56.600]  we are not going to have any programs where we're trying
[2:00:56.600 --> 2:00:58.600]  to jab 6 month old babies
[2:00:58.600 --> 2:01:00.600]  with mRNA
[2:01:00.600 --> 2:01:02.600]  that's just the reality
[2:01:04.600 --> 2:01:06.600]  and I think what happened was
[2:01:06.600 --> 2:01:08.600]  they thought somehow we would
[2:01:08.600 --> 2:01:10.600]  we would like be embarrassed by that
[2:01:10.600 --> 2:01:12.600]  no we're following the data
[2:01:12.600 --> 2:01:14.600]  you look at these European countries
[2:01:14.600 --> 2:01:16.600]  they are
[2:01:16.600 --> 2:01:18.600]  a lot of them don't even allow Moderna for under age 30
[2:01:18.600 --> 2:01:20.600]  or they recommend against it
[2:01:20.600 --> 2:01:22.600]  so that was always that we still have not ordered it
[2:01:22.600 --> 2:01:24.600]  we're not going to order it now
[2:01:24.600 --> 2:01:26.600]  what they're saying is because practitioners
[2:01:26.600 --> 2:01:28.600]  and hospitals can order it somehow we reverse
[2:01:28.600 --> 2:01:30.600]  I said from the beginning
[2:01:30.600 --> 2:01:32.600]  they'll be able to do that
[2:01:32.600 --> 2:01:34.600]  we don't have the authority to prevent it
[2:01:34.600 --> 2:01:36.600]  if someone wants to make a different decision
[2:01:36.600 --> 2:01:38.600]  I would just caution people
[2:01:38.600 --> 2:01:40.600]  look at the actual data in the clinical trial
[2:01:40.600 --> 2:01:42.600]  it is the weakest
[2:01:42.600 --> 2:01:44.600]  possible data
[2:01:44.600 --> 2:01:46.600]  that you could possibly see
[2:01:46.600 --> 2:01:48.600]  very small number of people
[2:01:48.600 --> 2:01:50.600]  what the recommendation is from them
[2:01:50.600 --> 2:01:52.600]  doesn't even track the outcomes
[2:01:52.600 --> 2:01:54.600]  it was something that
[2:01:54.600 --> 2:01:56.600]  but people can ask their pediatricians
[2:01:56.600 --> 2:01:58.600]  they can ask their doctors
[2:01:58.600 --> 2:02:00.600]  what's the evidence of protection against severe disease
[2:02:00.600 --> 2:02:02.600]  there was none in the clinical trial
[2:02:02.600 --> 2:02:04.600]  but that's something that people would do
[2:02:04.600 --> 2:02:06.600]  but for us
[2:02:06.600 --> 2:02:08.600]  Joe Lattapo our department of health
[2:02:08.600 --> 2:02:10.600]  has looked at it there is no proven benefit
[2:02:10.600 --> 2:02:12.600]  to put a baby
[2:02:12.600 --> 2:02:14.600]  with an MNRA
[2:02:14.600 --> 2:02:16.600]  so that's why our recommendation is against it
[2:02:16.600 --> 2:02:18.600]  that's different than prohibiting the use
[2:02:18.600 --> 2:02:20.600]  in Florida which we don't have the
[2:02:20.600 --> 2:02:22.600]  the authority to do and quite frankly
[2:02:22.600 --> 2:02:24.600]  we're confident people can make
[2:02:24.600 --> 2:02:26.600]  their own judgments on it
[2:02:26.600 --> 2:02:28.600]  but I would say when you look at the trial
[2:02:28.600 --> 2:02:30.600]  one of the things they did they did not have
[2:02:30.600 --> 2:02:32.600]  babies or very young kids
[2:02:32.600 --> 2:02:34.600]  who had recovered from COVID in the trial
[2:02:34.600 --> 2:02:36.600]  so we don't know what this will do
[2:02:36.600 --> 2:02:38.600]  for people that have recovered
[2:02:38.600 --> 2:02:40.600]  but in their recommendation
[2:02:40.600 --> 2:02:42.600]  they are recommending
[2:02:42.600 --> 2:02:44.600]  giving the mRNA shot
[2:02:44.600 --> 2:02:46.600]  to people young babies and kids
[2:02:46.600 --> 2:02:48.600]  that have already recovered from COVID
[2:02:48.600 --> 2:02:50.600]  they don't have any clinical data on that
[2:02:50.600 --> 2:02:52.600]  and people have looked at some of this stuff
[2:02:52.600 --> 2:02:54.600]  and have recognized how that
[2:02:54.600 --> 2:02:56.600]  and you know what the White House is bragging
[2:02:56.600 --> 2:02:58.600]  that we're the only country
[2:02:58.600 --> 2:03:00.600]  trying to do mRNA shots
[2:03:00.600 --> 2:03:02.600]  for infants and I'm just thinking to myself
[2:03:02.600 --> 2:03:04.600]  well wait a minute there's nothing wrong
[2:03:04.600 --> 2:03:06.600]  with being the lone ranger
[2:03:06.600 --> 2:03:08.600]  if you're right but the
[2:03:08.600 --> 2:03:10.600]  other countries in Europe that are going
[2:03:10.600 --> 2:03:12.600]  in a different direction similar to the direction Florida
[2:03:12.600 --> 2:03:14.600]  has gone they have been right
[2:03:14.600 --> 2:03:16.600]  on COVID way more
[2:03:16.600 --> 2:03:18.600]  than Fauci and his crew have been
[2:03:18.600 --> 2:03:20.600]  throughout this whole thing remember
[2:03:20.600 --> 2:03:22.600]  these are people in Washington
[2:03:22.600 --> 2:03:24.600]  that rejected the idea of
[2:03:24.600 --> 2:03:26.600]  natural immunity for a year
[2:03:26.600 --> 2:03:28.600]  and a half they said that the vaccine
[2:03:28.600 --> 2:03:30.600]  was better than prior infection
[2:03:30.600 --> 2:03:32.600]  and every credible study
[2:03:32.600 --> 2:03:34.600]  that's been done has said that
[2:03:34.600 --> 2:03:36.600]  that's not the case and so they've been wrong
[2:03:36.600 --> 2:03:38.600]  time and time again they were wrong
[2:03:38.600 --> 2:03:40.600]  when they criticized me for having schools
[2:03:40.600 --> 2:03:42.600]  open they wanted our kids locked out of school
[2:03:42.600 --> 2:03:44.600]  in the state of Florida they were wrong
[2:03:44.600 --> 2:03:46.600]  when they criticized me for having businesses
[2:03:46.600 --> 2:03:48.600]  open beaches all these other things
[2:03:48.600 --> 2:03:50.600]  and so this is an example
[2:03:50.600 --> 2:03:52.600]  where they are pushing this
[2:03:52.600 --> 2:03:54.600]  with very
[2:03:54.600 --> 2:03:56.600]  very scant data
[2:03:56.600 --> 2:03:58.600]  but again people can make their judgments
[2:03:58.600 --> 2:04:00.600]  but ask questions
[2:04:00.600 --> 2:04:02.600]  and the fact of the matter is I think what this whole
[2:04:02.600 --> 2:04:04.600]  year and a half has shown us
[2:04:04.600 --> 2:04:06.600]  is these regulatory agencies
[2:04:06.600 --> 2:04:08.600]  in the federal government
[2:04:08.600 --> 2:04:10.600]  have basically become
[2:04:10.600 --> 2:04:12.600]  subsidiaries of the pharmaceutical companies
[2:04:12.600 --> 2:04:14.600]  they are not
[2:04:14.600 --> 2:04:16.600]  independent regulators
[2:04:16.600 --> 2:04:18.600]  they basically are there to rubber stamp
[2:04:18.600 --> 2:04:20.600]  what Pfizer wants to do
[2:04:20.600 --> 2:04:22.600]  so people can make their judgments
[2:04:22.600 --> 2:04:24.600]  on it but we have not
[2:04:24.600 --> 2:04:26.600]  ordered any for the Department of Health
[2:04:26.600 --> 2:04:28.600]  there's been absolutely
[2:04:28.600 --> 2:04:30.600]  zero change in our recommendations
[2:04:30.600 --> 2:04:32.600]  and the recommendations remember
[2:04:32.600 --> 2:04:34.600]  we were the first state to recommend
[2:04:34.600 --> 2:04:36.600]  against 6 to 11 year olds
[2:04:36.600 --> 2:04:38.600]  we never had any state programs for any of that
[2:04:38.600 --> 2:04:40.600]  there have been some practitioners
[2:04:40.600 --> 2:04:42.600]  that have ordered it and some have gotten it
[2:04:42.600 --> 2:04:44.600]  most parents are not giving it
[2:04:44.600 --> 2:04:46.600]  for the kids with the MNRA
[2:04:46.600 --> 2:04:48.600]  but some did and I think it's the same thing
[2:04:48.600 --> 2:04:50.600]  so this is a continuation
[2:04:50.600 --> 2:04:52.600]  of our policy that we've had in place
[2:04:52.600 --> 2:05:20.600]  really since the spring
[2:05:20.600 --> 2:05:22.600]  documents it's now out in the open
[2:05:22.600 --> 2:05:24.600]  Klaus Schwab said last week
[2:05:24.600 --> 2:05:26.600]  that they rule the earth
[2:05:26.600 --> 2:05:28.600]  the Bilderberg group founded Davos Group
[2:05:28.600 --> 2:05:30.600]  so now
[2:05:30.600 --> 2:05:32.600]  the fight's out in the open
[2:05:32.600 --> 2:05:34.600]  they're making their move because they know
[2:05:34.600 --> 2:05:36.600]  they're behind schedule we're going to win this thing
[2:05:36.600 --> 2:05:38.600]  God's watching the children counting on us
[2:05:38.600 --> 2:05:40.600]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners
[2:05:40.600 --> 2:05:42.600]  for your word of mouth and your prayer
[2:05:42.600 --> 2:05:44.600]  and your financial support because without you
[2:05:44.600 --> 2:05:46.600]  info wars would not be here
[2:05:46.600 --> 2:05:48.600]  I want you to really internalize the fact that
[2:05:48.600 --> 2:05:50.600]  info war and you are the reason
[2:05:50.600 --> 2:05:52.600]  humanity has a fight against
[2:05:52.600 --> 2:05:54.600]  so I want to thank you and salute you again
[2:05:54.600 --> 2:05:56.600]  for all you've done and ask you now
[2:05:56.600 --> 2:06:24.600]  to double your efforts
[2:06:24.600 --> 2:06:34.600]  you'll find your musket but I'll run you through
[2:06:34.600 --> 2:06:36.600]  you'll take my life but I'll take you too
[2:06:36.600 --> 2:06:40.600]  you'll find your musket but I'll run you through
[2:06:40.600 --> 2:06:42.600]  so when you're waiting for the next attack
[2:06:42.600 --> 2:06:46.600]  you better stand there's no turning back
[2:06:46.600 --> 2:06:48.600]  the fewest hours the time begins
[2:06:48.600 --> 2:06:52.600]  but on this battlefield no one wins
[2:06:52.600 --> 2:06:55.600]  the spell of my strong and awesome breath
[2:06:55.600 --> 2:06:59.600]  is a burden that's a certain death
[2:06:59.600 --> 2:07:02.600]  as we charge into certain death
[2:07:02.600 --> 2:07:04.600]  ha ha ha
[2:07:04.600 --> 2:07:07.600]  with our ancestors breathing power
[2:07:07.600 --> 2:07:12.600]  enlightening us
[2:07:12.600 --> 2:07:15.600]  you better stand there's no turning back
[2:07:15.600 --> 2:07:20.600]  the bugle sounds the charge begins
[2:07:20.600 --> 2:07:22.600]  charge this
[2:07:22.600 --> 2:07:24.600]  they are depleting us they are bankrupting us
[2:07:24.600 --> 2:07:26.600]  they are poisoning us they are killing us
[2:07:26.600 --> 2:07:29.600]  but we as our ancestors did
[2:07:29.600 --> 2:07:32.600]  will awaken crack it back up
[2:07:32.600 --> 2:07:57.600]  we will take the challenge
[2:07:57.600 --> 2:08:07.600]  oh oh oh
[2:08:07.600 --> 2:08:09.600]  we like your ancestors
[2:08:09.600 --> 2:08:11.600]  be strong
[2:08:11.600 --> 2:08:13.600]  face eternity
[2:08:13.600 --> 2:08:15.600]  join God
[2:08:15.600 --> 2:08:18.600]  and join us in the future
[2:08:18.600 --> 2:08:21.600]  we are waiting for you
[2:08:21.600 --> 2:08:23.600]  in the time space bridge
[2:08:23.600 --> 2:08:26.600]  we are here together forever
[2:08:26.600 --> 2:08:29.600]  choose the spirit which you follow now
[2:08:29.600 --> 2:08:32.600]  and choose wisely
[2:08:32.600 --> 2:08:34.600]  I am waiting
[2:08:34.600 --> 2:08:37.600]  you are waiting
[2:08:37.600 --> 2:08:39.600]  we are together now
[2:08:39.600 --> 2:08:41.600]  forever
[2:08:41.600 --> 2:08:43.600]  nothing can change that
[2:08:43.600 --> 2:08:45.600]  except your free will
[2:08:45.600 --> 2:08:48.600]  take the decision now
[2:08:48.600 --> 2:08:50.600]  join us
[2:08:50.600 --> 2:08:52.600]  join life
[2:08:52.600 --> 2:08:53.600]  join honor
[2:08:53.600 --> 2:08:55.600]  join the great mission
[2:08:55.600 --> 2:08:57.600]  the great commission
[2:08:57.600 --> 2:09:19.600]  music
[2:09:19.600 --> 2:09:22.600]  bring us a ghost near and let's fight
[2:09:22.600 --> 2:09:25.600]  when a person gets beaten in size
[2:09:25.600 --> 2:09:28.600]  he pulls the trigger and I feel the flow
[2:09:28.600 --> 2:09:31.600]  I push the bars take my heart to love
[2:09:31.600 --> 2:09:34.600]  and as I lay the gaze in at the sky
[2:09:34.600 --> 2:09:37.600]  my body's numb and my throat is dry
[2:09:37.600 --> 2:09:40.600]  and as I lay forgotten in the road
[2:09:40.600 --> 2:09:43.600]  when I tear up to the touching ground
[2:09:43.600 --> 2:09:46.600]  oh oh oh
[2:09:46.600 --> 2:09:48.600]  but you did not die in dishonor
[2:09:48.600 --> 2:09:50.600]  and you died in victory
[2:09:50.600 --> 2:09:53.600]  and you will never live spiritually
[2:09:53.600 --> 2:09:55.600]  among those that bound to evil
[2:09:55.600 --> 2:09:57.600]  God hates cowards
[2:09:57.600 --> 2:10:00.600]  and God loves children, drunks
[2:10:00.600 --> 2:10:03.600]  and the United States of America
[2:10:03.600 --> 2:10:05.600]  ha ha ha
[2:10:05.600 --> 2:10:08.600]  we have the victory in our hands
[2:10:08.600 --> 2:10:10.600]  alright I had a caller hold over
[2:10:10.600 --> 2:10:11.600]  Joe in Florida
[2:10:11.600 --> 2:10:13.600]  he's a horticologist
[2:10:13.600 --> 2:10:15.600]  person that grows plants
[2:10:15.600 --> 2:10:17.600]  he told you he's run big marijuana labs
[2:10:17.600 --> 2:10:19.600]  illegal ones everything
[2:10:19.600 --> 2:10:21.600]  triple the carbon dioxide
[2:10:21.600 --> 2:10:23.600]  80% yield is on all the studies
[2:10:23.600 --> 2:10:25.600]  don't need to believe him just look it up yourself
[2:10:25.600 --> 2:10:28.600]  deserts disappear with only 20-30% increase
[2:10:28.600 --> 2:10:30.600]  the world's greening right now
[2:10:30.600 --> 2:10:32.600]  the sun is good it's all good
[2:10:32.600 --> 2:10:35.600]  God gave it to us why is everything
[2:10:35.600 --> 2:10:37.600]  that's live giving
[2:10:37.600 --> 2:10:41.600]  under attack by these criminals
[2:10:41.600 --> 2:10:44.600]  Joe in Florida tell us more
[2:10:44.600 --> 2:10:47.600]  well you know we hear Fauci saying
[2:10:47.600 --> 2:10:49.600]  I am the science
[2:10:49.600 --> 2:10:52.600]  the thing with science now is
[2:10:52.600 --> 2:10:54.600]  there's really bad stuff going on
[2:10:54.600 --> 2:10:57.600]  in one example is in cosmology
[2:10:57.600 --> 2:10:59.600]  there's this pseudo science
[2:10:59.600 --> 2:11:01.600]  that started with Einstein with black holes
[2:11:01.600 --> 2:11:04.600]  and just really nonsensical notions
[2:11:04.600 --> 2:11:06.600]  of black holes dark matter
[2:11:06.600 --> 2:11:08.600]  and things that include infinities
[2:11:08.600 --> 2:11:10.600]  and they supposedly came up with
[2:11:10.600 --> 2:11:12.600]  these things with equations
[2:11:12.600 --> 2:11:14.600]  well we know if you're doing an equation
[2:11:14.600 --> 2:11:17.600]  you can't have an infinity in the equation
[2:11:17.600 --> 2:11:19.600]  and really this stuff is based on
[2:11:19.600 --> 2:11:21.600]  they say it's based on mathematics
[2:11:21.600 --> 2:11:23.600]  but as soon as you're using an infinity
[2:11:23.600 --> 2:11:25.600]  that's a non-tangible idea
[2:11:25.600 --> 2:11:27.600]  that you can't do math
[2:11:27.600 --> 2:11:29.600]  you can say whatever you want mathematically
[2:11:29.600 --> 2:11:31.600]  with an infinity
[2:11:31.600 --> 2:11:33.600]  right and so
[2:11:33.600 --> 2:11:35.600]  they basically saw that galaxies
[2:11:35.600 --> 2:11:37.600]  outer arms were rotating way quicker
[2:11:37.600 --> 2:11:39.600]  than they would have expected
[2:11:39.600 --> 2:11:41.600]  looking at the mass that they could see
[2:11:41.600 --> 2:11:43.600]  in the galaxy and they said well there must be
[2:11:43.600 --> 2:11:45.600]  this invisible thing in the middle of it
[2:11:45.600 --> 2:11:47.600]  that means to work
[2:11:47.600 --> 2:11:49.600]  so we have this conveniently invisible
[2:11:49.600 --> 2:11:51.600]  undetectable infinitely dense
[2:11:51.600 --> 2:11:53.600]  black hole in the middle
[2:11:53.600 --> 2:11:55.600]  and the same thing with dark matter
[2:11:55.600 --> 2:11:57.600]  they had a bad equation
[2:11:57.600 --> 2:11:59.600]  and instead of saying well maybe our theory is wrong
[2:11:59.600 --> 2:12:01.600]  they said let's fix the equation
[2:12:01.600 --> 2:12:03.600]  with this undetectable dark matter
[2:12:03.600 --> 2:12:05.600]  and so if your listeners tune into
[2:12:05.600 --> 2:12:07.600]  Thunderbolts project on YouTube
[2:12:07.600 --> 2:12:09.600]  they are into
[2:12:09.600 --> 2:12:11.600]  electric universe theory
[2:12:11.600 --> 2:12:14.600]  which Thomas Alfing won the Nobel Prize for
[2:12:14.600 --> 2:12:16.600]  and
[2:12:16.600 --> 2:12:18.600]  they have great
[2:12:18.600 --> 2:12:20.600]  theories on how all this stuff
[2:12:20.600 --> 2:12:22.600]  really works in cosmology
[2:12:22.600 --> 2:12:24.600]  giving your view on an alternative view
[2:12:24.600 --> 2:12:26.600]  which science is all about alternative views and questioning
[2:12:26.600 --> 2:12:28.600]  what is your
[2:12:28.600 --> 2:12:30.600]  what is your competing view
[2:12:30.600 --> 2:12:32.600]  with a unified field theory
[2:12:32.600 --> 2:12:34.600]  well there are these massive electric currents
[2:12:34.600 --> 2:12:36.600]  in outer space called Birkeland's currents
[2:12:36.600 --> 2:12:38.600]  that Christian Birkeland was able
[2:12:38.600 --> 2:12:40.600]  to model in the lab and all the stuff
[2:12:40.600 --> 2:12:42.600]  from Thunderbolts project is
[2:12:42.600 --> 2:12:44.600]  observable
[2:12:44.600 --> 2:12:46.600]  and by the way we know the galaxy
[2:12:46.600 --> 2:12:48.600]  and all the matter is electromagnetically connected
[2:12:48.600 --> 2:12:50.600]  you are right so there are storms
[2:12:50.600 --> 2:12:52.600]  going on is what you are saying
[2:12:52.600 --> 2:12:54.600]  well so mainstream
[2:12:54.600 --> 2:12:56.600]  science will acknowledge
[2:12:56.600 --> 2:12:58.600]  that there is these magnetic fields around planets
[2:12:58.600 --> 2:13:00.600]  and the sun and everything but they don't want to tell you
[2:13:00.600 --> 2:13:02.600]  that there is electric currents coming into the poles
[2:13:02.600 --> 2:13:04.600]  of the planets and the sun
[2:13:04.600 --> 2:13:06.600]  that are powering what the sun is being
[2:13:06.600 --> 2:13:08.600]  powered by electric currents coming into it
[2:13:08.600 --> 2:13:10.600]  which is why the outer corona of the sun
[2:13:10.600 --> 2:13:12.600]  is the hottest part
[2:13:12.600 --> 2:13:14.600]  it's not being powered by nuclear reactions
[2:13:14.600 --> 2:13:16.600]  inside of it where it's actually cooler
[2:13:16.600 --> 2:13:18.600]  and we can see that we can observe it
[2:13:18.600 --> 2:13:20.600]  it's cooler when you look down into the sunspots
[2:13:20.600 --> 2:13:22.600]  which are like holes
[2:13:22.600 --> 2:13:24.600]  sure it's an engine being given outside power
[2:13:24.600 --> 2:13:26.600]  exactly and that's why all the galaxies
[2:13:26.600 --> 2:13:28.600]  rotate at the same speed regardless of their size
[2:13:28.600 --> 2:13:30.600]  because they are being powered by these massive
[2:13:30.600 --> 2:13:32.600]  light years long
[2:13:32.600 --> 2:13:34.600]  hundreds of light years long Birkeland's currents
[2:13:34.600 --> 2:13:36.600]  and the argument is though
[2:13:36.600 --> 2:13:38.600]  where does the Birkeland current come from
[2:13:38.600 --> 2:13:40.600]  well it's kind of a chicken and an egg thing almost
[2:13:40.600 --> 2:13:42.600]  because you got everything
[2:13:42.600 --> 2:13:44.600]  powering
[2:13:44.600 --> 2:13:46.600]  but that goes towards the dark matter theory
[2:13:46.600 --> 2:13:48.600]  which I understand there
[2:13:48.600 --> 2:13:50.600]  you think giving a false hypothesis
[2:13:50.600 --> 2:13:52.600]  for why it exists but there is
[2:13:52.600 --> 2:13:54.600]  outside energy being fed into this dimension
[2:13:54.600 --> 2:13:56.600]  well if you look
[2:13:56.600 --> 2:13:58.600]  at the
[2:13:58.600 --> 2:14:00.600]  radio telescopes
[2:14:00.600 --> 2:14:02.600]  modeling of how the universe looks
[2:14:02.600 --> 2:14:04.600]  there's this big web of
[2:14:04.600 --> 2:14:06.600]  Birkeland's currents
[2:14:06.600 --> 2:14:08.600]  they're averse
[2:14:08.600 --> 2:14:10.600]  to that idea but
[2:14:10.600 --> 2:14:12.600]  it's a very
[2:14:12.600 --> 2:14:14.600]  predictive theory for instance asteroids
[2:14:14.600 --> 2:14:16.600]  have been now shown to be made of
[2:14:16.600 --> 2:14:18.600]  or comets have been
[2:14:18.600 --> 2:14:20.600]  shown to be made of the same material as asteroids
[2:14:20.600 --> 2:14:22.600]  whereas they said well comets are these icy things
[2:14:22.600 --> 2:14:24.600]  that start melting when they get near the sun
[2:14:24.600 --> 2:14:26.600]  and that's where the tail comes from
[2:14:26.600 --> 2:14:28.600]  but electric universe theory would have said
[2:14:28.600 --> 2:14:30.600]  no as soon as you start coming into the sun's magnetic field
[2:14:30.600 --> 2:14:32.600]  there's this electrical interaction
[2:14:32.600 --> 2:14:34.600]  sure just like lightning
[2:14:34.600 --> 2:14:36.600]  that's fair
[2:14:36.600 --> 2:14:38.600]  and yes and tornadoes are an example
[2:14:38.600 --> 2:14:40.600]  of a slow discharge of electricity
[2:14:40.600 --> 2:14:42.600]  as opposed to a sudden one like lightning
[2:14:42.600 --> 2:14:44.600]  sure but the question goes back to
[2:14:44.600 --> 2:14:46.600]  where does this outside power source come from
[2:14:48.600 --> 2:14:50.600]  well
[2:14:50.600 --> 2:14:52.600]  it seems to be being exchanged amongst
[2:14:52.600 --> 2:14:54.600]  all the galaxies
[2:14:54.600 --> 2:14:56.600]  and stars
[2:14:56.600 --> 2:14:58.600]  and all the stars are found in the z-pinch
[2:14:58.600 --> 2:15:00.600]  what they call these Birkeland's currents
[2:15:00.600 --> 2:15:02.600]  where the currents twist together
[2:15:02.600 --> 2:15:04.600]  as to how planets are formed
[2:15:04.600 --> 2:15:06.600]  because if all of a sudden the star gets too much
[2:15:06.600 --> 2:15:08.600]  energy going into it it'll spit out
[2:15:08.600 --> 2:15:10.600]  a planetary body which is like a molten
[2:15:10.600 --> 2:15:12.600]  glob and which is how it turns out to be
[2:15:12.600 --> 2:15:14.600]  completely spherical
[2:15:14.600 --> 2:15:16.600]  whereas gravitational accretion theory
[2:15:16.600 --> 2:15:18.600]  says that a bunch of junk
[2:15:18.600 --> 2:15:20.600]  starts to accumulate on top of the sky
[2:15:20.600 --> 2:15:22.600]  it polishes perfectly into that which is pure BS
[2:15:22.600 --> 2:15:24.600]  you're right it doesn't make nearly as much sense
[2:15:24.600 --> 2:15:26.600]  and
[2:15:26.600 --> 2:15:28.600]  so that's where vaporized matter
[2:15:28.600 --> 2:15:30.600]  shot out into zero gravity
[2:15:30.600 --> 2:15:32.600]  will form a sphere
[2:15:32.600 --> 2:15:34.600]  right
[2:15:34.600 --> 2:15:36.600]  and plasma experiments
[2:15:36.600 --> 2:15:38.600]  in the laboratory now have shown
[2:15:38.600 --> 2:15:40.600]  there's a project called
[2:15:40.600 --> 2:15:42.600]  Sapphire
[2:15:42.600 --> 2:15:44.600]  F-A-F-I-R-E
[2:15:44.600 --> 2:15:46.600]  that has shown that
[2:15:46.600 --> 2:15:48.600]  they can use extremely high
[2:15:48.600 --> 2:15:50.600]  electrical current
[2:15:50.600 --> 2:15:52.600]  hold on Joe I want to hear more of this and other callers coming up
[2:15:52.600 --> 2:15:54.600]  but this is too important
[2:15:56.600 --> 2:15:58.600]  that's just as soon as a new film
[2:15:58.600 --> 2:16:00.600]  is made
[2:16:00.600 --> 2:16:02.600]  the most important documentary in modern times
[2:16:02.600 --> 2:16:04.600]  because it proves how the deep state
[2:16:04.600 --> 2:16:06.600]  stole the 2020 election
[2:16:06.600 --> 2:16:08.600]  and how they're planning to steal future elections
[2:16:08.600 --> 2:16:10.600]  and complete our journey to basically
[2:16:10.600 --> 2:16:12.600]  being like Venezuela
[2:16:12.600 --> 2:16:14.600]  now it's great that it's online and great that millions watch online
[2:16:14.600 --> 2:16:16.600]  but you need to have the high quality
[2:16:16.600 --> 2:16:18.600]  HD, DVD in your library
[2:16:18.600 --> 2:16:20.600]  with the expanded extras

[2:21:34.600 --> 2:21:36.600]  what you're getting at here is
[2:21:36.600 --> 2:21:38.600]  the official cosmology we're given
[2:21:38.600 --> 2:21:40.600]  is not accurate
[2:21:40.600 --> 2:21:42.600]  by any stretch of imagination
[2:21:42.600 --> 2:21:44.600]  and obviously the people studying things
[2:21:44.600 --> 2:21:46.600]  who know that
[2:21:46.600 --> 2:21:48.600]  why are they giving us a false cosmology
[2:21:48.600 --> 2:21:50.600]  yes in my view
[2:21:50.600 --> 2:21:52.600]  they are and there's a lot of evidence about
[2:21:52.600 --> 2:21:54.600]  on the Thunderbolts project
[2:21:54.600 --> 2:21:56.600]  your listeners and viewers could
[2:21:56.600 --> 2:21:58.600]  really appreciate it's not
[2:21:58.600 --> 2:22:00.600]  above people's heads
[2:22:00.600 --> 2:22:02.600]  like a lot of this stuff is supposedly
[2:22:02.600 --> 2:22:04.600]  it's so complicated that you just can't understand it
[2:22:04.600 --> 2:22:06.600]  you're not smart
[2:22:06.600 --> 2:22:08.600]  that's what they want to tell you
[2:22:08.600 --> 2:22:10.600]  and then they do this equation on the blackboard
[2:22:10.600 --> 2:22:12.600]  that nobody can understand
[2:22:12.600 --> 2:22:14.600]  it's an electrical energy connected
[2:22:14.600 --> 2:22:16.600]  grid
[2:22:16.600 --> 2:22:18.600]  of suns and planets and more
[2:22:18.600 --> 2:22:20.600]  right
[2:22:20.600 --> 2:22:22.600]  and
[2:22:22.600 --> 2:22:24.600]  the staff fire project I was mentioning
[2:22:24.600 --> 2:22:26.600]  they've proven now
[2:22:26.600 --> 2:22:28.600]  transmutation of elements
[2:22:28.600 --> 2:22:30.600]  occurs in this lab in this vacuum
[2:22:30.600 --> 2:22:32.600]  chamber that has
[2:22:32.600 --> 2:22:34.600]  an immense electrical
[2:22:34.600 --> 2:22:36.600]  discharge going into a
[2:22:36.600 --> 2:22:38.600]  an anode
[2:22:38.600 --> 2:22:40.600]  or a cathode
[2:22:40.600 --> 2:22:42.600]  with enough power to power a city for a day
[2:22:42.600 --> 2:22:44.600]  they're able to actually change elements
[2:22:44.600 --> 2:22:46.600]  they have machines that do that
[2:22:46.600 --> 2:22:48.600]  yes and so they've shown that
[2:22:48.600 --> 2:22:50.600]  this has been independently verified
[2:22:50.600 --> 2:22:52.600]  that there's elements
[2:22:52.600 --> 2:22:54.600]  after the experiment in the chamber
[2:22:54.600 --> 2:22:56.600]  they weren't there before
[2:22:56.600 --> 2:22:58.600]  well that's how they've created new elements
[2:22:58.600 --> 2:23:00.600]  you can type it in
[2:23:00.600 --> 2:23:02.600]  Los Alamos creates new element
[2:23:02.600 --> 2:23:04.600]  type that in
[2:23:04.600 --> 2:23:06.600]  let's just one laboratory doing this
[2:23:06.600 --> 2:23:08.600]  are Japanese create new element
[2:23:08.600 --> 2:23:10.600]  periodic table the end of it
[2:23:10.600 --> 2:23:12.600]  has a lot of elements that are
[2:23:12.600 --> 2:23:14.600]  transitory they're able to create and they disappear
[2:23:14.600 --> 2:23:16.600]  but these elements I'm talking about
[2:23:16.600 --> 2:23:18.600]  are like carbon, nitrogen
[2:23:18.600 --> 2:23:20.600]  oxygen stuff like that
[2:23:20.600 --> 2:23:22.600]  they're able to
[2:23:22.600 --> 2:23:24.600]  you know that's stable afterwards
[2:23:24.600 --> 2:23:26.600]  and they've created them like
[2:23:26.600 --> 2:23:28.600]  as if you know
[2:23:28.600 --> 2:23:30.600]  the alchemists were trying to do
[2:23:30.600 --> 2:23:32.600]  real quick I want to plug my brother's
[2:23:32.600 --> 2:23:34.600]  look COVID-42
[2:23:34.600 --> 2:23:36.600]  it's a dystopian
[2:23:36.600 --> 2:23:38.600]  futuristic novel called
[2:23:38.600 --> 2:23:40.600]  COVID-42 by Matt Bender
[2:23:40.600 --> 2:23:42.600]  interested
[2:23:42.600 --> 2:23:44.600]  I'll look into it brother thanks for all the great points
[2:23:44.600 --> 2:23:46.600]  you made very thought-provoking
[2:23:46.600 --> 2:23:48.600]  we don't want to keep a call around
[2:23:48.600 --> 2:23:50.600]  for 30 minutes but he had a lot to say
[2:23:50.600 --> 2:23:52.600]  and I think everybody thought it was informative
[2:23:52.600 --> 2:23:54.600]  and enlightening and enjoyable
[2:23:54.600 --> 2:23:56.600]  so we kept him on let's get everybody else
[2:23:56.600 --> 2:23:58.600]  for the salarins I'll get to all of you
[2:23:58.600 --> 2:24:00.600]  who's up next here that would be
[2:24:02.600 --> 2:24:04.600]  down the second
[2:24:04.600 --> 2:24:06.600]  the longest
[2:24:06.600 --> 2:24:08.600]  that would be
[2:24:08.600 --> 2:24:10.600]  Josh in Arizona, Josh you're on the air

[2:24:22.600 --> 2:24:24.600]  I received that brother
[2:24:24.600 --> 2:24:26.600]  thank you
[2:24:26.600 --> 2:24:28.600]  oh yes well hey
[2:24:28.600 --> 2:24:30.600]  I'd like to plug really quick just the other day
[2:24:30.600 --> 2:24:32.600]  I bought a few copies of
[2:24:32.600 --> 2:24:34.600]  mules from info war store
[2:24:34.600 --> 2:24:36.600]  I'm planning on giving those out to some of my friends
[2:24:36.600 --> 2:24:38.600]  and I have about
[2:24:38.600 --> 2:24:40.600]  a two-year supply of X2
[2:24:40.600 --> 2:24:42.600]  I love it
[2:24:42.600 --> 2:24:44.600]  so thank you so much for the great brother
[2:24:44.600 --> 2:24:46.600]  because we've been treading water here without you we'd be off the air
[2:24:46.600 --> 2:24:48.600]  so everything we do is you
[2:24:48.600 --> 2:24:50.600]  I don't want to just tell us or that I mean that
[2:24:50.600 --> 2:24:52.600]  it's true
[2:24:52.600 --> 2:24:54.600]  you are everything thank you
[2:24:54.600 --> 2:24:56.600]  yeah yeah thanks for
[2:24:56.600 --> 2:24:58.600]  the great product well hey
[2:24:58.600 --> 2:25:00.600]  so the topic today was
[2:25:00.600 --> 2:25:02.600]  what about the new world order
[2:25:02.600 --> 2:25:04.600]  what are we doing against about it
[2:25:04.600 --> 2:25:06.600]  and I want to highlight
[2:25:06.600 --> 2:25:08.600]  one
[2:25:08.600 --> 2:25:10.600]  really important
[2:25:10.600 --> 2:25:12.600]  member
[2:25:12.600 --> 2:25:14.600]  of the opposition in particular
[2:25:14.600 --> 2:25:16.600]  and I'm really surprised
[2:25:16.600 --> 2:25:18.600]  that you haven't
[2:25:18.600 --> 2:25:20.600]  you know had this person on your show
[2:25:20.600 --> 2:25:22.600]  or something because
[2:25:22.600 --> 2:25:24.600]  all of many of your most notable
[2:25:24.600 --> 2:25:26.600]  guests over the past several years
[2:25:26.600 --> 2:25:28.600]  are either
[2:25:28.600 --> 2:25:30.600]  old advisory positions
[2:25:30.600 --> 2:25:32.600]  on the board of her
[2:25:32.600 --> 2:25:34.600]  of her foundation
[2:25:34.600 --> 2:25:36.600]  it's a 501C3
[2:25:36.600 --> 2:25:38.600]  faith-based
[2:25:38.600 --> 2:25:40.600]  charity
[2:25:40.600 --> 2:25:42.600]  Dr. Elizabeth Leigh
[2:25:42.600 --> 2:25:44.600]  she
[2:25:44.600 --> 2:25:46.600]  wrote the intro to Dr. Bregen's
[2:25:46.600 --> 2:25:48.600]  book
[2:25:48.600 --> 2:25:50.600]  she works very closely with Dr. Peter
[2:25:50.600 --> 2:25:52.600]  Chambers
[2:25:52.600 --> 2:25:54.600]  and actually
[2:25:54.600 --> 2:25:56.600]  we will ask her to come on the show
[2:25:56.600 --> 2:25:58.600]  I'm taking calls
[2:25:58.600 --> 2:26:00.600]  Dr. Elizabeth Leigh
[2:26:00.600 --> 2:26:02.600]  Velit
[2:26:02.600 --> 2:26:04.600]  and her organization is
[2:26:04.600 --> 2:26:06.600]  Truth for Health Foundation
[2:26:06.600 --> 2:26:08.600]  truthforhealth.org
[2:26:08.600 --> 2:26:10.600]  and Dr. McCullough when he was on your
[2:26:10.600 --> 2:26:12.600]  program
[2:26:12.600 --> 2:26:14.600]  provided that resource to your
[2:26:14.600 --> 2:26:16.600]  listeners and I'd like to
[2:26:16.600 --> 2:26:18.600]  just point out that there are
[2:26:18.600 --> 2:26:20.600]  amazing resources there
[2:26:20.600 --> 2:26:22.600]  she runs
[2:26:22.600 --> 2:26:24.600]  a
[2:26:24.600 --> 2:26:26.600]  it's a fund
[2:26:26.600 --> 2:26:28.600]  it's a
[2:26:28.600 --> 2:26:30.600]  medical
[2:26:30.600 --> 2:26:32.600]  freedom fund
[2:26:32.600 --> 2:26:34.600]  for members of the military
[2:26:34.600 --> 2:26:36.600]  that are facing court
[2:26:36.600 --> 2:26:38.600]  for refusing the vaccination
[2:26:38.600 --> 2:26:40.600]  and those grants
[2:26:40.600 --> 2:26:42.600]  go towards their legal defense
[2:26:42.600 --> 2:26:44.600]  I know there's a lot of great people behind
[2:26:44.600 --> 2:26:46.600]  all these movements was not aware of her
[2:26:46.600 --> 2:26:48.600]  probably read her name before but
[2:26:48.600 --> 2:26:50.600]  we will definitely try to get her on
[2:26:50.600 --> 2:26:52.600]  thank you so much
[2:26:52.600 --> 2:26:54.600]  Dr. McCullough
[2:26:54.600 --> 2:26:56.600]  has formed a strategic partnership
[2:26:56.600 --> 2:26:58.600]  with one of your past guests
[2:26:58.600 --> 2:27:00.600]  Vax Action
[2:27:00.600 --> 2:27:02.600]  and they're doing a very
[2:27:02.600 --> 2:27:04.600]  detailed statistical analysis
[2:27:04.600 --> 2:27:06.600]  of the vaccine injuries and also providing
[2:27:06.600 --> 2:27:08.600]  resources for the vaccine injured
[2:27:08.600 --> 2:27:10.600]  what do you think of this British Medical
[2:27:10.600 --> 2:27:12.600]  Journal official editor report
[2:27:12.600 --> 2:27:14.600]  saying the vaccines don't help you
[2:27:14.600 --> 2:27:16.600]  they hurt you that's pretty big right
[2:27:16.600 --> 2:27:18.600]  well I think it's
[2:27:18.600 --> 2:27:20.600]  exactly as you say
[2:27:20.600 --> 2:27:22.600]  but
[2:27:22.600 --> 2:27:24.600]  and with
[2:27:24.600 --> 2:27:26.600]  those types of official sources
[2:27:26.600 --> 2:27:28.600]  counter
[2:27:28.600 --> 2:27:30.600]  countering their previous narrative
[2:27:30.600 --> 2:27:32.600]  it's going to create
[2:27:32.600 --> 2:27:34.600]  a lot of confusion
[2:27:34.600 --> 2:27:36.600]  and they're going to roll that out slowly
[2:27:36.600 --> 2:27:38.600]  so that in hopes
[2:27:38.600 --> 2:27:40.600]  that everyone sort of forget
[2:27:40.600 --> 2:27:42.600]  where the information came from
[2:27:42.600 --> 2:27:44.600]  that's what they're trying to do is set the precedent to kill us
[2:27:44.600 --> 2:27:46.600]  with mandated poisons
[2:27:46.600 --> 2:27:48.600]  but imagine the Cajones
[2:27:48.600 --> 2:27:50.600]  to
[2:27:50.600 --> 2:27:52.600]  know this is all coming out and now try to
[2:27:52.600 --> 2:27:54.600]  make six month olds take it
[2:27:54.600 --> 2:27:56.600]  I mean that is so
[2:27:56.600 --> 2:27:58.600]  evil that is abortion after birth
[2:27:58.600 --> 2:28:00.600]  God bless you I appreciate your call
[2:28:00.600 --> 2:28:02.600]  we're going to go to break
[2:28:02.600 --> 2:28:04.600]  and we're going to go right to your calls in order to receive
[2:28:04.600 --> 2:28:06.600]  we are going to be taking all of them here
[2:28:06.600 --> 2:28:08.600]  we're going to be talking to Robert
[2:28:08.600 --> 2:28:10.600]  next
[2:28:10.600 --> 2:28:12.600]  and we're going to be talking to Brian
[2:28:12.600 --> 2:28:14.600]  and Tyler and everybody else
[2:28:14.600 --> 2:28:16.600]  on the other side get ready
[2:28:16.600 --> 2:28:18.600]  we've got Brian saying his wife's a nurse
[2:28:18.600 --> 2:28:20.600]  fired for a
[2:28:20.600 --> 2:28:22.600]  covid test denial which is all a fraud
[2:28:22.600 --> 2:28:24.600]  to begin with yeah it's all a
[2:28:24.600 --> 2:28:26.600]  neurotic hysteria
[2:28:26.600 --> 2:28:28.600]  fear and now they're getting the new emergency ready
[2:28:28.600 --> 2:28:30.600]  with the monkey pox the UN says they're preparing
[2:28:30.600 --> 2:28:32.600]  to declare a new global emergency
[2:28:32.600 --> 2:28:34.600]  and everybody follows the UN order
[2:28:34.600 --> 2:28:36.600]  to put the mask back on
[2:28:36.600 --> 2:28:38.600]  and start the checkpoints and the testing and all the
[2:28:38.600 --> 2:28:40.600]  hysteria again while it's the shots that are causing
[2:28:40.600 --> 2:28:42.600]  the lion's share of the illnesses
[2:28:42.600 --> 2:28:44.600]  all the studies and research in the British Medical Journal
[2:28:44.600 --> 2:28:46.600]  show
[2:28:46.600 --> 2:28:48.600]  wow, talk about vindication
[2:28:48.600 --> 2:28:50.600]  you've been vindicated, our guests have been vindicated
[2:28:50.600 --> 2:28:52.600]  I've been vindicated, enforcers have been vindicated
[2:28:52.600 --> 2:28:54.600]  yet again, tomorrow's news today
[2:28:54.600 --> 2:28:56.600]  we'll be right back, stay with us
[2:28:56.600 --> 2:28:58.600]  ladies and gentlemen
[2:28:58.600 --> 2:29:00.600]  in the last 30 months we've witnessed the globalist
[2:29:00.600 --> 2:29:02.600]  hit humanity and hit humanity
[2:29:02.600 --> 2:29:04.600]  extremely hard
[2:29:04.600 --> 2:29:06.600]  it is beyond critical
[2:29:06.600 --> 2:29:08.600]  that everyone listening to the sound of my voice

[2:29:12.600 --> 2:29:14.600]  and these two new sales do that
[2:29:14.600 --> 2:29:16.600]  we have the ultimate immune support

[2:30:00.600 --> 2:30:02.600]  music
[2:30:02.600 --> 2:30:04.600]  I want to say brain force is great
[2:30:04.600 --> 2:30:06.600]  I want to say turbo force is amazing, it is
[2:30:06.600 --> 2:30:08.600]  but if you took it with fish oil
[2:30:08.600 --> 2:30:10.600]  it's like the fish oil is it
[2:30:10.600 --> 2:30:12.600]  the fish oil is better than it
[2:30:12.600 --> 2:30:14.600]  and that's an example of what I'm talking about
[2:30:14.600 --> 2:30:16.600]  fish oil is liquid energy
[2:30:16.600 --> 2:30:18.600]  brain, body, heart, the cleanest
[2:30:18.600 --> 2:30:20.600]  the best out there, krill oils is the best
[2:30:20.600 --> 2:30:22.600]  and it'll give you the damn burps
[2:30:22.600 --> 2:30:24.600]  and I'm sorry, you want something like this
[2:30:24.600 --> 2:30:26.600]  you don't get stuff for free, the krill is hallucinogenic
[2:30:26.600 --> 2:30:28.600]  it's so good, in my view
[2:30:28.600 --> 2:30:30.600]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something
[2:30:30.600 --> 2:30:32.600]  I eat five caplets of krill oil
[2:30:32.600 --> 2:30:34.600]  before I go to bed, I'm seeing Santa Claus that night
[2:30:34.600 --> 2:30:36.600]  so
[2:30:36.600 --> 2:30:38.600]  your brain is made
[2:30:38.600 --> 2:30:40.600]  basically out of what
[2:30:40.600 --> 2:30:42.600]  fish oil is
[2:30:42.600 --> 2:30:44.600]  so
[2:30:44.600 --> 2:30:46.600]  we don't make a big profit off of it, but you know
[2:30:46.600 --> 2:30:48.600]  I'm just obsessed, because whatever the best is we've got
[2:30:48.600 --> 2:30:50.600]  I just can't lie to you, I just can't do it
[2:30:50.600 --> 2:30:52.600]  infor story time
[2:30:52.600 --> 2:30:54.600]  music
[2:30:54.600 --> 2:30:56.600]  music
[2:30:56.600 --> 2:30:58.600]  at this point, best case scenario
[2:30:58.600 --> 2:31:00.600]  is a few years
[2:31:00.600 --> 2:31:02.600]  of hard times for us all
[2:31:02.600 --> 2:31:04.600]  and if we don't turn it around soon
[2:31:04.600 --> 2:31:06.600]  then it will only get worse
[2:31:06.600 --> 2:31:08.600]  but as bad as things are
[2:31:08.600 --> 2:31:10.600]  we still have time to prepare
[2:31:10.600 --> 2:31:12.600]  and that alone is something
[2:31:12.600 --> 2:31:14.600]  to be grateful for
[2:31:14.600 --> 2:31:16.600]  a gravity water filter
[2:31:16.600 --> 2:31:18.600]  will provide you with clean healthy water
[2:31:18.600 --> 2:31:20.600]  even in the event of your taps
[2:31:20.600 --> 2:31:22.600]  getting shut off
[2:31:22.600 --> 2:31:24.600]  and having your own food will save you from
[2:31:24.600 --> 2:31:26.600]  getting ensnared in government FEMA camps
[2:31:26.600 --> 2:31:28.600]  and if you've already
[2:31:28.600 --> 2:31:30.600]  stocked up enough for your own family
[2:31:30.600 --> 2:31:32.600]  you might want to consider
[2:31:32.600 --> 2:31:34.600]  stocking up for your neighbors
[2:31:34.600 --> 2:31:36.600]  some of your neighbors
[2:31:36.600 --> 2:31:38.600]  might not be prepared for what's coming
[2:31:38.600 --> 2:31:40.600]  but you can help them
[2:31:40.600 --> 2:31:42.600]  by having an abundance of
[2:31:42.600 --> 2:31:44.600]  storable foods and water filtration
[2:31:44.600 --> 2:31:46.600]  whoever sews
[2:31:46.600 --> 2:31:48.600]  bountifully will also reap
[2:31:48.600 --> 2:31:50.600]  bountifully

[2:45:57.040 --> 2:46:01.720]  Dinesh D'Souza's new film 2000 Mules is the most important documentary in modern times
[2:46:01.720 --> 2:46:06.200]  because it proves how the deep state stole the 2020 election and how they're planning
[2:46:06.200 --> 2:46:10.440]  to steal future elections and complete our journey to basically being like Venezuela.
[2:46:10.440 --> 2:46:14.600]  Now it's great that it's online, it's great that millions watch online, but you need to

[2:47:54.840 --> 2:47:58.840]  Let's go ahead and take a call here from DJ in New York. DJ you're on the air as they
[2:47:58.840 --> 2:48:04.840]  should call him. Hi Alex, how are you doing? I'm in the fight brother, that's where I need
[2:48:04.840 --> 2:48:10.840]  to be. I'm doing damn well actually. Alright, that's great. I was so pleased to get a chance
[2:48:10.840 --> 2:48:18.840]  to meet you last summer at the Trump International Hotel just for a moment when you were, I don't
[2:48:18.840 --> 2:48:22.840]  know, doing a long walk around Central Park, going to the UN, and then you ended up at the
[2:48:22.840 --> 2:48:29.840]  border after that. And I had a nice talk with Tim, you're ahead of security, what a gentleman
[2:48:29.840 --> 2:48:35.840]  he is. And we were too worn out from the day and whatever, I felt a little bad for you.
[2:48:35.840 --> 2:48:40.840]  You look like such a battle-hardened warrior. I was so impressed. I mean, I'm 20 years
[2:48:40.840 --> 2:48:46.840]  older than you. But man, the wear and tear that you have, it shows in your composure,
[2:48:46.840 --> 2:48:51.840]  but you're strong underneath all that. You're still soldiering on and fighting the good
[2:48:51.840 --> 2:48:58.840]  fight. The spirit is strong, but the flesh is weak. That's right. So what I want to bring
[2:48:58.840 --> 2:49:03.840]  to your attention, because I know we got to get on to other followers, and it was entertaining
[2:49:03.840 --> 2:49:08.840]  to listen, particularly to Joe from Florida, because his views about electromagnetics are
[2:49:08.840 --> 2:49:17.840]  something I'm very tuned into, because that's the one thing if we had access to the right
[2:49:17.840 --> 2:49:22.840]  electromagnetic pulse technology, we could destroy all the nanotechnology in all these
[2:49:22.840 --> 2:49:25.840] ... Oh, that's all the real technology. Everything's electrochemical.
[2:49:25.840 --> 2:49:31.840]  Yeah. Well, they could kill all that off with the right technology, but they're hiding that.
[2:49:31.840 --> 2:49:36.840]  So what I wanted to talk about, to push out into the open with you, what I wanted to share
[2:49:36.840 --> 2:49:42.840]  with you when I met you, there was no time, is that here in New York, the epicenter of
[2:49:42.840 --> 2:49:49.840]  all this, where the UN is, where the money system is centered, is this place called Roosevelt
[2:49:49.840 --> 2:49:57.840]  Island. And on Roosevelt Island, it used to be a penal colony, among other things. And
[2:49:57.840 --> 2:50:07.840]  so you have a monument to FDR, and you have on that same area of the island a new tech
[2:50:07.840 --> 2:50:14.840]  center, the Cornell University Tech Center, funded by Bloomberg and the government of
[2:50:14.840 --> 2:50:22.840]  Israel. This is something that certainly would be a great, Greg Rees report. What they're
[2:50:22.840 --> 2:50:28.840]  doing in that university is developing the drones of the future from very tiny ones to
[2:50:28.840 --> 2:50:34.840]  large ones. And those drones are going to be used in their next stage of the war when
[2:50:34.840 --> 2:50:42.840]  the chaos really begins. And those drones are going to be charged at points that are
[2:50:42.840 --> 2:50:47.840]  on the tops of buildings where they can land and recharge. There'll be many points around
[2:50:47.840 --> 2:50:54.840]  the city, and this model will get rolled out nationally so that they can go after us and
[2:50:54.840 --> 2:51:00.840]  follow us. And many times, we may be able to see the drone like I see the one going up
[2:51:00.840 --> 2:51:04.840]  and down the East River, keeping an eye on the UN, but there'll be small ones that we
[2:51:04.840 --> 2:51:12.840]  won't see. So we're talking today about the surveillance state and how we're going to deal
[2:51:12.840 --> 2:51:18.840]  with that. And it's going to be like the calm before the storm when, for example, cell
[2:51:18.840 --> 2:51:23.840]  phones first appeared and people looked at it all strange and then all of a sudden everybody
[2:51:23.840 --> 2:51:25.840]  had it. Well, that's what's going to happen.
[2:51:25.840 --> 2:51:29.840]  It's a robot takeover. You're right. The drone's the tip of the spear. Not the technology's
[2:51:29.840 --> 2:51:33.840]  bad, but it's programmable. It'll follow orders when humans won't. You're absolutely
[2:51:33.840 --> 2:51:38.840]  right. God bless you, DJ. It was good to meet you in New York. Let's go to Robert in
[2:51:38.840 --> 2:51:44.840]  Pennsylvania. Robert, you're on the air. Go ahead. Hey, Alex. Yeah, I'm just calling
[2:51:44.840 --> 2:51:52.840]  to see if you guys made any progress on what the abnormal tissue that's been growing in
[2:51:52.840 --> 2:52:00.840]  people and getting cold blood clots is because it's growing some type of nanotech
[2:52:00.840 --> 2:52:06.840]  quasi metal thing in the body using the body's own tissues to grow these tumors is
[2:52:06.840 --> 2:52:10.840]  designed to basically take the body over. I mean, we've had major scientists on this
[2:52:10.840 --> 2:52:15.840]  definitely going on. There's huge studies documenting it. I mean, this is a giant
[2:52:15.840 --> 2:52:21.840]  assault. Well, to me, when they were showing the pictures on one of the days that you
[2:52:21.840 --> 2:52:26.840]  were gone, they had the electron microscope in there. To me, it's pretty obvious that
[2:52:26.840 --> 2:52:34.840]  that is malformed or mutated nerve tissue. Well, you're right. The way it goes out through
[2:52:34.840 --> 2:52:40.840]  the flesh looks like it's following nerve endings. Yeah. And it, to me, it wouldn't
[2:52:40.840 --> 2:52:50.840]  surprise me if that's just a rollout of the next step towards what Elon Musk and the
[2:52:50.840 --> 2:52:54.840]  other people are trying to implement with the Neural Lake. I think they're about to
[2:52:54.840 --> 2:53:02.840]  find the same brick walls that the secret research organizations have ran into.
[2:53:02.840 --> 2:53:09.840]  That's right. They haven't grown the neural implant interface points in the human population
[2:53:09.840 --> 2:53:14.840]  won't work. Yeah, it wouldn't surprise me that if a full autopsy on those people, they
[2:53:14.840 --> 2:53:22.840]  would find out that their neural tissue was also growing in the same manner. You know,
[2:53:22.840 --> 2:53:30.840]  like, describe this rather as an alien takeover. Yeah, well, I mean, like Elon is doing his
[2:53:30.840 --> 2:53:38.840]  neural link in order to, as he states, control AI or, you know, but the thing is, is you
[2:53:38.840 --> 2:53:45.840]  can't actually have anything other than brute force machine learning technology as AI unless
[2:53:45.840 --> 2:53:51.840]  you have quantum computing, which there is only one way to actually generate intelligence,
[2:53:51.840 --> 2:53:59.840]  and that is with a living brain. So what Elon is trying to do is actually create AI
[2:53:59.840 --> 2:54:07.840]  through cognitive AI through that type of interface. But it also appears that the government is
[2:54:07.840 --> 2:54:13.840]  attempting to do the same thing, and they just got 95% of the world's population to donate
[2:54:13.840 --> 2:54:19.840]  DNA samples to perfecting it. I actually have a stack of news that I said I would get to
[2:54:19.840 --> 2:54:23.840]  today, but I'll have to cover at the start of the show tomorrow, that actually they've
[2:54:23.840 --> 2:54:27.840]  announced all that it's all being announced, which is insane right now.
[2:54:27.840 --> 2:54:34.840]  Yeah, and it's pretty obvious that the trends towards augmented reality, I mean, you look
[2:54:34.840 --> 2:54:40.840]  at all of the filters on Snapchat and TikTok, that's all implementation of augmented reality.
[2:54:40.840 --> 2:54:45.840]  Well, with as terrible as the world is getting, you can see that all the cars and all the
[2:54:45.840 --> 2:54:48.840]  buildings are going to explode. Yeah, they're not going to let you commute, they're going
[2:54:48.840 --> 2:54:52.840]  to force you to live into the system, then robots and computers will produce the food
[2:54:52.840 --> 2:54:57.840]  and water and medicine you to survive while you're being forced to integrate with machines
[2:54:57.840 --> 2:55:01.840]  to survive into that system. That's the admitted plan, sir. I meant to cover that today, and
[2:55:01.840 --> 2:55:05.840]  I didn't, but you just covered it right now. Thank you so much. Amazing point, Robert.
[2:55:05.840 --> 2:55:09.840]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to Tyler in Kansas. Tyler, go ahead.
[2:55:09.840 --> 2:55:12.840]  Hey, Alex, can you hear me? Yeah, I can. Go ahead.
[2:55:12.840 --> 2:55:17.840]  Hey, man. Hey, I appreciate you and everything you've done. Been a listener for a while.
[2:55:17.840 --> 2:55:23.840]  Appreciate you. You're great and thank you for the fight. All I was going to cover is
[2:55:23.840 --> 2:55:29.840]  I have a four-month-old daughter, my youngest, and no way am I getting that COVID shot for
[2:55:29.840 --> 2:55:34.840]  it. I don't care what they, it's crazy that they're even saying that. Why would adults
[2:55:34.840 --> 2:55:39.840]  even get that? But the fight's getting strong because I've been seeing it in doctor's offices
[2:55:39.840 --> 2:55:44.840]  for my kids that they'll put on there if you're going for a physical or anything. If your
[2:55:44.840 --> 2:55:49.840]  child's had a COVID shot, that they're not going to pass the physical because of their heart.
[2:55:49.840 --> 2:55:54.840]  So that's another sign that we're- Even police departments are saying that, yeah.
[2:55:54.840 --> 2:55:58.840]  Yeah. And so that's another thing that we're, it's, people are starting to learn. You're
[2:55:58.840 --> 2:56:03.840]  hearing them in the waiting room like, what, they can't get a physical? And it's, yeah,
[2:56:03.840 --> 2:56:07.840]  it's, it's that serious. So I just wanted to say, hey, thank you. And I've got everybody
[2:56:07.840 --> 2:56:12.840]  in my office here on your coffee and we're getting on the eye, dying to everything, and
[2:56:12.840 --> 2:56:16.840]  we're going to support you as much as we can. Well, thank you, brother. But, you know,
[2:56:16.840 --> 2:56:22.840]  go back to what you just said, Tyler, because that's so huge. I'm seeing news reports is
[2:56:22.840 --> 2:56:30.840]  being confirmed. Police departments are saying, hey, the Ironman in Hawaii, the police department
[2:56:30.840 --> 2:56:34.840]  had a bunch of extra ambulances saying, get ready for heart attacks. And they happened.
[2:56:34.840 --> 2:56:38.840]  And even the police departments know this is going on, but you're going to doctor's offices
[2:56:38.840 --> 2:56:42.840]  and they've got signs up saying, sorry, you can't take the physical if you've had the
[2:56:42.840 --> 2:56:46.840]  COVID shot, you may have a heart attack. Yeah. Yeah. Your heart, you will not, you will
[2:56:46.840 --> 2:56:50.840]  literally not have because of your heart if you've got the COVID shot. And that's for
[2:56:50.840 --> 2:56:54.840]  kids as well. Well, they've got like a 100 plus thousand time. The number I was seeing
[2:56:54.840 --> 2:56:59.840]  increase in heart attacks and blood problems with professional athletes. I mean, this is
[2:56:59.840 --> 2:57:04.840]  huge. They hit us with it. They're doing it. They're just testing to see if we wake up
[2:57:04.840 --> 2:57:09.840]  to it and say no. Thank you so much for the call. All right, Heath and Michael, we're going
[2:57:09.840 --> 2:57:12.840]  to go to break for two minutes. I'm going to come back and finish up with you guys.
[2:57:12.840 --> 2:57:16.840]  And then J. Dyer is taking over. And then I'm keeping the stack and a few other stacks
[2:57:16.840 --> 2:57:22.840]  I didn't get to. I will cover this stack tomorrow. I could spend an hour on this stack alone
[2:57:22.840 --> 2:57:26.840]  with everything in the last few callers. Just talked about, please don't forget

[2:58:11.840 --> 2:58:17.840]  They said last week that they rule the earth. The Bilderberg group founded Davos Group.
[2:58:17.840 --> 2:58:22.840]  So now the fight's out in the open. They're making their move because they know they're
[2:58:22.840 --> 2:58:26.840]  behind schedule. We're going to win this thing. God's watching. The children are counting on us.
[2:58:26.840 --> 2:58:30.840]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and
[2:58:30.840 --> 2:58:34.840]  your financial support because without you, Info Wars would not be here. I want you to
[2:58:34.840 --> 2:58:39.840]  really internalize the fact that you are the Info War and you are the reason humanity has
[2:58:39.840 --> 2:58:43.840]  a fighting chance. So I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done and
[2:58:43.840 --> 2:58:46.840]  ask you now to redouble your efforts.
[2:58:46.840 --> 2:58:50.840]  The globalists are making their move. Their great reset is here. They're coming for your
[2:58:50.840 --> 2:58:54.840]  children. They're coming for the value of your currency. They're coming for your national
[2:58:54.840 --> 2:59:00.840]  sovereignty. They're coming for your very bodies with their biomedical tyranny. They're
[2:59:00.840 --> 2:59:05.840]  coming for your free speech. They're coming for your privacy. And ladies and gentlemen,
[2:59:05.840 --> 2:59:09.840]  they're coming for your right to vote and have your representative in government that
[2:59:09.840 --> 2:59:14.840]  you and your fellow Americans choose. The new film, the seminal film, the most important

[3:00:13.840 --> 3:00:19.840]  And in one hour, the war is on Shroyer. We're talking to Heath and Michael right now. And
[3:00:19.840 --> 3:00:23.840]  then J. Dyer always thought provoking. Man, is he well researched. You want to know what's
[3:00:23.840 --> 3:00:27.840]  really going on? Tune in right now when he comes up in five minutes. But Michael in
[3:00:27.840 --> 3:00:33.840]  Oklahoma, you're on the air and then Heath, go ahead. Hey, what's up, Alex? Good. Yeah,
[3:00:33.840 --> 3:00:40.840]  thanks for what you do, man. So you're asking people about how to stop the globalist. And
[3:00:40.840 --> 3:00:46.840]  I think this concept is perfectly illustrated by the race for governor in Pennsylvania. You
[3:00:46.840 --> 3:00:54.840]  have Josh Shapiro on the Democrats and Doug Mastriano for the Republicans. And you know,
[3:00:54.840 --> 3:01:00.840]  I was just wondering if you had any what you take on the race for governor in Pennsylvania
[3:01:00.840 --> 3:01:07.840]  was. I mean, I've followed it some, but I mean, what's your view on that? Well, the first
[3:01:07.840 --> 3:01:13.840]  time I ever noticed Josh Shapiro, he was on TV bragging after the 2020 election about
[3:01:13.840 --> 3:01:18.840]  how he received more votes than any other politician in Pennsylvania's history, which
[3:01:18.840 --> 3:01:26.840]  is kind of a weird red flag when you think about it. And you know, there's not too much
[3:01:26.840 --> 3:01:32.840]  information about him when you try to research him online. And yeah, I was just hoping that
[3:01:32.840 --> 3:01:40.840]  maybe you had well, take Dr. Oz as soon as he got Trump's endorsement and as soon as
[3:01:40.840 --> 3:01:45.840]  he won his primary, now he's dropped Trump from his website. Yeah, well, it's the same
[3:01:45.840 --> 3:01:51.840]  thing when I said Josh Shapiro back in 2020 was bragging pretty heavily about how he
[3:01:51.840 --> 3:01:56.840]  received more votes than any politician in Pennsylvania's history. But now that point
[3:01:56.840 --> 3:02:01.840]  is not anywhere in his campaign, you know, website or materials. He doesn't really talk
[3:02:01.840 --> 3:02:09.840]  about it. And you know, the whole thing just seems, you know, unusual. His whole thing
[3:02:09.840 --> 3:02:15.840]  is unusual. And I basically was just wondering if you had any, you know, opinion or information
[3:02:15.840 --> 3:02:20.840]  about that. I'll be honest with you. I know about the race. I'm not really following it
[3:02:20.840 --> 3:02:25.840]  much. And so it sounds like you know a lot more than I do. But thank you so much. Heath
[3:02:25.840 --> 3:02:31.840]  and Maine, you're on the air. Last caller before J. Dyer takes over. Alex Jones, thanks
[3:02:31.840 --> 3:02:35.840]  for taking my call. Thank you. Hey, I want to just want to mention that I've seen all
[3:02:35.840 --> 3:02:40.840]  your documentaries. I own them. I awoke in 2012 because of you. I got bumper stickers
[3:02:40.840 --> 3:02:46.840]  on the back of my car. So I am a info warrior. I did have a question though. Do you remember
[3:02:46.840 --> 3:02:52.840]  the Halliburton black coffins? I saw that I think it was Jesse Ventura. Are they still
[3:02:52.840 --> 3:02:57.840]  going to be using that? Or is that just lost and forgotten about now? Well, there's all
[3:02:57.840 --> 3:03:04.840]  sorts of mass grave programs and incinerators and crematoriums ready and FEMA, you know,
[3:03:04.840 --> 3:03:11.840]  with Anchorage loaded up with plastic coffin liners. And so that stuff goes on. And so
[3:03:11.840 --> 3:03:16.840]  I don't know. They're saying a new pandemic's here. The UN's about to roll it out. Monkey
[3:03:16.840 --> 3:03:22.840]  dogs. They're the ones behind it all. Yeah, so more about the lockdown. So the masks,
[3:03:22.840 --> 3:03:28.840]  they're coming back, the lockdowns, checkpoints. The UN has announced that it's imminently about
[3:03:28.840 --> 3:03:32.840]  to declare a new global emergency and bring on the same controls, AP reports for the last
[3:03:32.840 --> 3:03:35.840]  two years. I don't know if they'll actually do it or what's going to happen, but they
[3:03:35.840 --> 3:03:42.840]  say it's about to happen. Man, I mean, I have two kids, eight and three, and no one in my
[3:03:42.840 --> 3:03:47.840]  family has taken that COVID shot. And I actually got discharged from a university. So I've
[3:03:47.840 --> 3:03:53.840]  been jipped out of an education because of it. But now my youngest is in that ballpark
[3:03:53.840 --> 3:04:00.840]  again. And man, it's just like evil is just, it's spreading rampant right now. Exactly.
[3:04:00.840 --> 3:04:05.840]  Evil is testing what it can get away with. Evil is putting us all through a test to see
[3:04:05.840 --> 3:04:10.840]  if they can launch the next big attack. And I can tell you, we're almost passing what
[3:04:10.840 --> 3:04:15.840]  they want to do. We want to fail the test and where they say no. But we're almost going
[3:04:15.840 --> 3:04:19.840]  to fail the test. We're right on the knife's edge of they may have to back off because
[3:04:19.840 --> 3:04:24.840]  people are awake, but they're testing, they're tracking. Thank you so much, Heath. All right.
[3:04:24.840 --> 3:04:30.840]  Powerful broadcast today. Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis, author, researcher, is about to
[3:04:30.840 --> 3:04:34.840]  drill into the globalist quotes, their own admissions, what they're up to on the other
[3:04:34.840 --> 3:04:39.840]  side for the next 55 minutes. And then Owen Troyer in the war room. Only way you find
[3:04:39.840 --> 3:04:43.840]  it, simplewars.com, four slash show and great stations around the country. And of course,
[3:04:43.840 --> 3:04:48.840]  band.video. Very thankful to everybody. Very thankful to crew. Great to be back. We love
[3:04:48.840 --> 3:04:52.840]  you all. Spreading the word is an active resistance. So please spread the word. The
[3:04:52.840 --> 3:04:59.840]  globalists are counting on you not doing it. Cognitive dissonance is a major issue
[3:04:59.840 --> 3:05:04.840]  amongst the left. It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[3:05:04.840 --> 3:05:09.840]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them
[3:05:09.840 --> 3:05:15.840]  a bottle of ultimate fish oil from infowarsstore.com. Studies have suggested that fish oils and
[3:05:15.840 --> 3:05:21.840]  fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels,
[3:05:21.840 --> 3:05:26.840]  decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory
[3:05:26.840 --> 3:05:32.840]  responses in joints and the digestive system. Recent studies have suggested that high
[3:05:32.840 --> 3:05:38.840]  EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration
[3:05:38.840 --> 3:05:44.840]  and activity of immune cells. It worked for my family. And now I can have a logical
[3:05:44.840 --> 3:05:50.840]  and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality. Get your ultimate
[3:05:50.840 --> 3:05:56.840]  fish oil for a friend, family member or yourself at infowarsstore.com.
[3:05:56.840 --> 3:06:05.840]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer. Jay's analysis coming
[3:06:05.840 --> 3:06:12.840]  in on the fourth hour today. And as Alex mentioned, I do typically just lecture from the global
[3:06:12.840 --> 3:06:16.840]  elite writings themselves. And today we're going to do that with a book that we haven't
[3:06:16.840 --> 3:06:22.840]  yet covered, which a couple summers ago I waited my entire way through. I don't know how I
[3:06:22.840 --> 3:06:27.840]  made it through it, but I did. And that's a book by a lesser known globalist who has a
[3:06:27.840 --> 3:06:31.840]  lot of influence when it comes to deep ecology. And that's going to be important because
[3:06:31.840 --> 3:06:36.840]  deep ecology is one of the cutout kind of fronts the elite use to re-engineer all of
[3:06:36.840 --> 3:06:42.840]  life and all of society, especially the idea that we need to alter everything that we
[3:06:42.840 --> 3:06:47.840]  think about man and his relationship to society, especially in the West because of
[3:06:47.840 --> 3:06:54.840]  capitalism, because of consumerism, and because we are evil carbon emitting toxic entities
[3:06:54.840 --> 3:07:00.840]  on the planet. And that is the character Freetov Capra. Freetov Capra is an important figure
[3:07:00.840 --> 3:07:05.840]  in the global elite structure because he has been writing for many years about what he
[3:07:05.840 --> 3:07:11.840]  called the turning point. And this was a book he wrote way back in 1982. And it was very
[3:07:11.840 --> 3:07:16.840]  ahead of its time. Now he was writing after the counterculture. So the counterculture,
[3:07:16.840 --> 3:07:22.840]  the 60s had just come about. That was pretty much for the most part fostered by the elite,
[3:07:22.840 --> 3:07:26.840]  fostered by the system for the purpose of social engineering that actually has connections
[3:07:26.840 --> 3:07:31.840]  back to not just the wealthiest people in the West, the big families, the oligarchs,
[3:07:31.840 --> 3:07:36.840]  but British intelligence had a big role in fostering and promoting psychedelia, psychedelic
[3:07:36.840 --> 3:07:41.840]  rock, the Beatles, these kinds of things. And so Capra is writing a few decades after
[3:07:41.840 --> 3:07:48.840]  that and saying, now we're at this point where society, science, and the new culture can
[3:07:48.840 --> 3:07:54.840]  emerge. And so the title of the book itself, Turning Point, Science, Society, and the
[3:07:54.840 --> 3:08:01.840]  Rising Culture, itself tells you that they view culture as a social engineering mechanism
[3:08:01.840 --> 3:08:06.840]  and tool. And he's saying that now we're at the turning point. Now the 80s are coming,
[3:08:06.840 --> 3:08:11.840]  we're going to have the rollout of what he calls a new physics and a new way of thinking,
[3:08:11.840 --> 3:08:20.840]  new way of thinking. So the book begins by saying, you are a cell in Gaia to be recycled.
[3:08:20.840 --> 3:08:24.840]  So he says, we've got to get away from this idea of thinking that we're individuals that
[3:08:24.840 --> 3:08:30.840]  we exist with an individual will or individual human persons. That's not real. That's something
[3:08:30.840 --> 3:08:36.840]  that the West has made up. That's a philosophy that Christianity made up, that Moses made
[3:08:36.840 --> 3:08:42.840]  up, that biblical religion made up. He says that now what we need to understand is that
[3:08:42.840 --> 3:08:48.840]  through a systems view of life, we are all part of a collective. So it's a total submersion
[3:08:48.840 --> 3:08:53.840]  of the individual into the monistic collective. Monism and philosophy is just the fancy word
[3:08:53.840 --> 3:09:01.840]  for everything is one, man. We're all just one dude. If you sat around and meditated enough,
[3:09:01.840 --> 3:09:09.840]  you would see that you're just me, man, and I'm just you, man. We're all just toes on
[3:09:09.840 --> 3:09:14.840]  the feet of Terrence McKenna, man. Do you want to be one with Terrence McKenna's toes?
[3:09:14.840 --> 3:09:20.840]  I don't. His bunions? I don't. But if all things are one, you are one with Terrence McKenna's
[3:09:20.840 --> 3:09:25.840]  bunions. And that's not a kind of a universe I want to live in. I'm just joking. But that
[3:09:25.840 --> 3:09:32.840]  is the view. The idea is literally that you are a cell in Gaia, which is just the whole
[3:09:32.840 --> 3:09:40.840]  Mother Earth, and you are to be recycled. And if you don't go along with the ecosystem
[3:09:40.840 --> 3:09:48.840]  as part of that natural cycle, you're a cancer on the planet. You see, this is the collectivist
[3:09:48.840 --> 3:09:52.840]  philosophy that the elite have chosen to go with right around the time of the Club of
[3:09:52.840 --> 3:09:57.840]  Rome and all that in the mid 20th century at the behest of the Rockefellers and the
[3:09:57.840 --> 3:10:03.840]  wealthiest people on the planet to foister upon the masses a new paradigm, a new philosophy
[3:10:03.840 --> 3:10:09.840]  that life itself is something that is not a right, but something that the elite should
[3:10:09.840 --> 3:10:12.840]  dole out. You don't have a right to live. You don't have a right to have children. All
[3:10:12.840 --> 3:10:16.840]  these things are going to be reversed in the new society. And so they needed a philosophy
[3:10:16.840 --> 3:10:22.840]  and they needed a science. That's the key thing here with Mr. Capra is that Friedolf
[3:10:22.840 --> 3:10:27.840]  Capra was a physicist. And so what he did was he wrote a lot of books. He did a lot
[3:10:27.840 --> 3:10:33.840]  of studies on not just physics, but physics in a mystical sense. So he's a mystical
[3:10:33.840 --> 3:10:40.840]  physicist, you might say. And he does a lot of critiques of rationalism and western
[3:10:40.840 --> 3:10:44.840]  materialists, which are good. So you start reading this book and he does several chapters
[3:10:44.840 --> 3:10:48.840]  early on critiquing materialism and it's like, well, yeah, yeah, exactly. That's actually
[3:10:48.840 --> 3:10:53.840]  a great point. And a lot of the environmental people, you know, the deep ecologists at times
[3:10:53.840 --> 3:10:57.840]  they have good insight. They'll say things like, we need to be careful with GMOs. We
[3:10:57.840 --> 3:11:02.840]  need to watch out for GMO food. We need to watch out for, you know, polluting the planet
[3:11:02.840 --> 3:11:08.840]  corporate pollution and so forth, which are legitimate concerns. However, that all got
[3:11:08.840 --> 3:11:14.840]  co-opted and shifted into something that's a complete 100% establishment, controlled
[3:11:14.840 --> 3:11:19.840]  and run operating system. And for example, you can look at the Earth Charter, which was
[3:11:19.840 --> 3:11:26.840]  this idea of a new covenant, a new 10 commandments, so to speak. And Mr. Capra is one of the
[3:11:26.840 --> 3:11:31.840]  international council members of the Earth Charter. So you can see that what he kind
[3:11:31.840 --> 3:11:38.840]  of does is take physics and kind of blend it into new agey stuff, not because he's, you
[3:11:38.840 --> 3:11:43.840]  know, seriously seeking some kind of mystical enlightenment or truth, but rather because
[3:11:43.840 --> 3:11:51.840]  it's an engineering process. It's a way to control people into austerity living, green
[3:11:51.840 --> 3:11:56.840]  living, living in a coom pot in a giant mega city, this kind of stuff. That's literally
[3:11:56.840 --> 3:12:01.840]  what the whole thing is. And once you see through that, it's kind of like, this isn't really
[3:12:01.840 --> 3:12:06.840]  about mysticism. This isn't about this kind of stuff. I mean, take, for example, another
[3:12:06.840 --> 3:12:15.840]  example of this, the esotericist Manly P. Hall, the famous esoteric mystical philosopher
[3:12:15.840 --> 3:12:23.840]  out in California. Manly P. Hall has only this lecture series, like 20 lectures on astrology.
[3:12:23.840 --> 3:12:28.840]  I remember listening to this 10, 15 years ago, and I was sitting there listening to all these
[3:12:28.840 --> 3:12:32.840]  lectures, and I was like, okay, this is interesting. And, you know, he's talking about all these
[3:12:32.840 --> 3:12:38.840]  different occult schools in the Arcana. And then the last lecture in the whole series is
[3:12:38.840 --> 3:12:43.840]  him saying, oh, by the way, the whole purpose of all this is to get you to accept the United
[3:12:43.840 --> 3:12:49.840]  Nations and world socialism. So the whole purpose of all your esoteric gibber jabber
[3:12:49.840 --> 3:12:55.840]  astrology was 20 something lectures to conclude and tell everybody that they have to accept
[3:12:55.840 --> 3:13:02.840]  world socialism. Literally. Now, that's interesting. Just a little side note here that this week
[3:13:02.840 --> 3:13:08.840]  I've been reading a lot on gurus and gurus in the New Age and its actual origins, right?
[3:13:08.840 --> 3:13:13.840]  It goes back to Madame Blavatsky, Annie Basant, Alice Bailey. And one thing that I had overlooked
[3:13:13.840 --> 3:13:19.840]  was the connection between, for example, Madame Blavatsky and intelligence, intelligence operation.
[3:13:19.840 --> 3:13:23.840]  Did you know that she was in the circles of a lot of spies? And perhaps she might have even been a spy
[3:13:23.840 --> 3:13:27.840]  herself. We don't know it's speculative. She might have been a British intelligence asset.
[3:13:27.840 --> 3:13:32.840]  But she was in the circles of a lot of people like Nicholas Rorick, who were Soviet spies.
[3:13:32.840 --> 3:13:37.840]  Many of the Bolsheviks, for example, were very interested in Satanism and the occult.
[3:13:37.840 --> 3:13:44.840]  There's a guy named Gleb Boki, who is a famous Bolshevist handler who was also into espionage
[3:13:44.840 --> 3:13:49.840]  and the occult. And we sort of realized, wait a minute, maybe the ascended masters that
[3:13:49.840 --> 3:13:55.840]  Crowley and Madame Blavatsky were interacting with, perhaps as Dr. Richard Spence argues in his book,
[3:13:55.840 --> 3:13:59.840]  they might have actually just been handlers. Now, I'm not saying that it's impossible,
[3:13:59.840 --> 3:14:04.840]  that she couldn't have been talking to ascended masters or something like that.
[3:14:04.840 --> 3:14:08.840]  She is the mother of the New Age movement, as well as Alistair Crowley.
[3:14:08.840 --> 3:14:12.840]  And it's interesting that both of them are confirmed to have at least some degree of connection
[3:14:12.840 --> 3:14:19.840]  to intelligence agents and assets. Crowley himself was an MI5 asset, did propaganda work
[3:14:19.840 --> 3:14:24.840]  at the time of World War I, and then was involved in various espionage operations
[3:14:24.840 --> 3:14:30.840]  at the behest of Maxwell Knight, Ian Fleming, and other British spy masters and British intelligence.
[3:14:30.840 --> 3:14:35.840]  So there's a clear connection here with this British intelligence fascination
[3:14:35.840 --> 3:14:40.840]  with the New Age, the occult, and helping to foster that.
[3:14:40.840 --> 3:14:45.840]  And the first time that the term is used, for example, New Age, I can think back to,
[3:14:45.840 --> 3:14:50.840]  I think there's a Scottish Rite journal which has something from Blavatsky quoted in it,
[3:14:50.840 --> 3:14:56.840]  and she says the New Age of Humanity will come into being through public schooling.
[3:14:56.840 --> 3:15:01.840]  And so she saw this as a millennial kind of ushering in of the kingdom of God,
[3:15:01.840 --> 3:15:06.840]  which for her was the brotherhood of man. And then we find out that later individuals,
[3:15:06.840 --> 3:15:12.840]  like Alice Bailey, she had a 10-point plan of how to bring about this New Age
[3:15:12.840 --> 3:15:16.840]  as a disciple of Blavatsky, and she said it would be through schooling
[3:15:16.840 --> 3:15:20.840]  and the infiltration of religion through these agents.
[3:15:20.840 --> 3:15:24.840]  So this is a real thing, this infiltration, this espionage,
[3:15:24.840 --> 3:15:28.840]  this promotion of that from the top, and I have to give credit to Greg Ries.
[3:15:28.840 --> 3:15:31.840]  Greg Ries called me this week, and he actually reminded me of that,
[3:15:31.840 --> 3:15:36.840]  about the 10-point plan from Alice Bailey. So shout out to Greg Ries, go check out his videos.
[3:15:36.840 --> 3:15:40.840]  I don't want to steal his thunder if he's making a video on that, so give credit to Greg Ries.
[3:15:40.840 --> 3:15:46.840]  But it connects directly into what Frito Capra, Frito Capricorn, is talking about
[3:15:46.840 --> 3:15:51.840]  with his physics, his new physics, and where they want to take us.
[3:15:51.840 --> 3:15:56.840]  So if you want to go anywhere, this is the Alex Jones Show, I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer, Jay Zanalsis.
[3:15:56.840 --> 3:16:00.840]  So I did it. I signed up for the Austin Marathon.
[3:16:00.840 --> 3:16:03.840]  I've been training, probably not as much as they should be,
[3:16:03.840 --> 3:16:07.840]  but thank goodness for prayer and thank goodness for InfowarsStore.com.
[3:16:07.840 --> 3:16:13.840]  Before I set out on a run, I throw down some Turbo Force to give me that energy I need
[3:16:13.840 --> 3:16:16.840]  to get going, you know, besides the energy Turbo Force,
[3:16:16.840 --> 3:16:21.840]  it is giving me the vitamins I need, like vitamin C to keep me healthy, and the essential B vitamins,
[3:16:21.840 --> 3:16:26.840]  plus the amino acids for sustained energy, giving me the best chance at getting through the training.
[3:16:26.840 --> 3:16:32.840]  And then every day now, I'm taking Dr. Jones' Sorilis. I have bad joints, thanks mom.
[3:16:32.840 --> 3:16:36.840]  So this is great for giving my joints the extra support they need right now,
[3:16:36.840 --> 3:16:40.840]  plus inflammation support and extra flexibility.
[3:16:40.840 --> 3:16:44.840]  The quick release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to the training.
[3:16:44.840 --> 3:16:49.840]  Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon, good news, Turbo Force,
[3:16:49.840 --> 3:16:52.840]  that can still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day,
[3:16:52.840 --> 3:17:16.840]  and Sorilis can keep you moving and feeling great at any age.

[3:18:23.840 --> 3:18:28.840]  You ever seen fish oil look like that? No, you never seen that, have you?
[3:18:28.840 --> 3:18:38.840]  And this little jewel right here is solid, liquid consciousness.
[3:18:38.840 --> 3:18:46.840]  Look it up, find out how even the FDA and the government admits fish oil is incredible.
[3:18:46.840 --> 3:18:51.840]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves is take good fish oil or krill oil,
[3:18:51.840 --> 3:18:55.840]  just like our information is dynamite, so are our products in forestore.com.
[3:19:22.840 --> 3:19:27.840]  It's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody
[3:19:27.840 --> 3:19:33.840]  to be able to do things tax wise that's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more your money.
[3:19:33.840 --> 3:19:38.840]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.
[3:19:38.840 --> 3:19:43.840]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL, jonestaxrelief.com,
[3:19:43.840 --> 3:19:53.840]  one word jonestaxrelief.com or call 833-904-285-833-904-285.
[3:20:14.840 --> 3:20:20.840]  We are in very mystical situations.
[3:20:20.840 --> 3:20:26.840]  And the secret to gurus is gurus, booger whistles.
[3:20:26.840 --> 3:20:30.840]  Did you know that the secret to all the gurus is the gurus booger whistle?
[3:20:30.840 --> 3:20:35.840]  It actually hits us frequency that actually invokes entities on the celestial plane.
[3:20:35.840 --> 3:20:40.840]  That's the secret to how the gurus are actually mind controlling everybody.
[3:20:40.840 --> 3:20:44.840]  They put you to sleep with that booger whistle they all have at the end of every one of their sentences,
[3:20:44.840 --> 3:20:46.840]  especially if there's an S word, right?
[3:20:46.840 --> 3:20:49.840]  Gurus.
[3:20:49.840 --> 3:20:53.840]  If you've watched enough Osho or Sadguru, you'll notice that, right?
[3:20:53.840 --> 3:21:00.840]  And by the way, you notice the gurus that are actually promoted by World Economic Forum like Sadguru there, right?
[3:21:00.840 --> 3:21:05.840]  I mean, he actually comes on and says, we need less people.
[3:21:05.840 --> 3:21:08.840]  He's like an evil suntan, Santa Claus, right?
[3:21:08.840 --> 3:21:12.840]  We need to get more people.
[3:21:12.840 --> 3:21:14.840]  That's an actual clip.
[3:21:14.840 --> 3:21:15.840]  I'm not making that up.
[3:21:15.840 --> 3:21:20.840]  I think Alex has played that quite a bit, the Sadguru talking about getting rid of most people.
[3:21:20.840 --> 3:21:26.840]  Anyway, so we're a cell on the surface of Gaia's skin to be recycled.
[3:21:26.840 --> 3:21:29.840]  We've got to be exfoliated off of him on Gaia.
[3:21:29.840 --> 3:21:34.840]  And he says that one of the characters interestingly who is quoted in this book,
[3:21:34.840 --> 3:21:39.840]  was a CIA mind control and culture guy, Gregory Bateson.
[3:21:39.840 --> 3:21:46.840]  And he also ties into this because he says, oh, yes, mind is just part of the global process.
[3:21:46.840 --> 3:21:47.840]  So let's get into the book.
[3:21:47.840 --> 3:21:50.840]  Those are quotes at the beginning of the book, by the way.
[3:21:50.840 --> 3:21:55.840]  Freedal Copper, like all the other globalists says, we're in a crisis, crisis, crisis, crisis.
[3:21:55.840 --> 3:21:58.840]  Every globally book starts with this.
[3:21:58.840 --> 3:22:01.840]  It's like they're written by an algorithm.
[3:22:01.840 --> 3:22:04.840]  It's the same cookie cutter thing.
[3:22:04.840 --> 3:22:06.840]  We're in a crisis.
[3:22:06.840 --> 3:22:09.840]  The world has developed nuclear weapons and we're all going to die.
[3:22:09.840 --> 3:22:12.840]  And there's going to be epidemics, which is interesting.
[3:22:12.840 --> 3:22:13.840]  He does mention epidemics.
[3:22:13.840 --> 3:22:19.840]  And he says that there's not enough energy to go around and we don't have enough resources.
[3:22:19.840 --> 3:22:24.840]  And so he says, if we don't kill off everybody, everybody's going to die.
[3:22:24.840 --> 3:22:25.840]  I'm not joking.
[3:22:25.840 --> 3:22:30.840]  They all say, it's like, we got to kill you because if we don't kill you, you'll die.
[3:22:30.840 --> 3:22:33.840]  I guess in guru logic, that actually makes sense, right?
[3:22:33.840 --> 3:22:36.840]  Because guru logic is always telling you to accept contradiction.
[3:22:36.840 --> 3:22:39.840]  Accept the contradictions.
[3:22:39.840 --> 3:22:42.840]  If we do not kill you, you will die.
[3:22:42.840 --> 3:22:45.840]  They took the stones from here.
[3:22:45.840 --> 3:22:48.840]  I mean, we're talking temple of doom stuff, literally, right?
[3:22:48.840 --> 3:22:52.840]  Everybody thinks about the thuggies, temple of doom, and like, oh, they're so evil.
[3:22:52.840 --> 3:22:58.840]  These people are more evil than at least the thuggie culture, like openly, you know, ripping the hearts out.
[3:22:58.840 --> 3:23:00.840]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[3:23:00.840 --> 3:23:02.840]  Calima.
[3:23:02.840 --> 3:23:04.840]  And everybody freaks out about that, right?
[3:23:04.840 --> 3:23:05.840]  But then.
[3:23:05.840 --> 3:23:07.840]  Son guru gets up there.
[3:23:07.840 --> 3:23:09.840]  Klaus gets up there all promoted by the same people.
[3:23:09.840 --> 3:23:11.840]  We must get everybody.
[3:23:11.840 --> 3:23:13.840]  Oh, so spiritual, bro.
[3:23:13.840 --> 3:23:14.840]  It's so spiritual.
[3:23:14.840 --> 3:23:19.840]  It's such a great message for humanity to kill everybody.
[3:23:19.840 --> 3:23:22.840]  Anyway, it says crisis, crisis, crisis.
[3:23:22.840 --> 3:23:23.840]  They always start their books.
[3:23:23.840 --> 3:23:24.840]  We're all in a crisis.
[3:23:24.840 --> 3:23:37.840]  And the crisis is, he says, the civilizational patterns that are leading to too much consumerism, too much stuff, too much, too much wealth, excuse me.
[3:23:37.840 --> 3:23:46.840]  And so since everything is evolving, he says, as all the global elite books say, we got to step up and steer the evolution.
[3:23:46.840 --> 3:23:47.840]  Right.
[3:23:47.840 --> 3:23:49.840]  If we don't steer evolution, it's going to go haywire.
[3:23:49.840 --> 3:23:50.840]  It's going to go crazy.
[3:23:50.840 --> 3:23:53.840]  Everybody's going to be mutating and we just can't have that.
[3:23:53.840 --> 3:23:56.840]  Steer evolution in the right direction.
[3:23:56.840 --> 3:24:01.840]  And the only way to do that, he says, is to get rid of fossil fuels.
[3:24:01.840 --> 3:24:02.840]  Shocker, right?
[3:24:02.840 --> 3:24:04.840]  Fossil fuels, fossil fuels.
[3:24:04.840 --> 3:24:05.840]  Now, why do they always want to get rid of it?
[3:24:05.840 --> 3:24:07.840]  Well, it's not really about fossil fuels.
[3:24:07.840 --> 3:24:13.840]  It's not really about oil and pollution, greenhouse gas.
[3:24:13.840 --> 3:24:18.840]  That's not really, those are all covers because it's an economic attack.
[3:24:18.840 --> 3:24:21.840]  So let's decode the global ease here.
[3:24:21.840 --> 3:24:26.840]  It's nothing to do with oil because they care about, you know, and by the way, that's not fossils.
[3:24:26.840 --> 3:24:27.840]  Okay.
[3:24:27.840 --> 3:24:28.840]  Oil isn't dinosaur juice.
[3:24:28.840 --> 3:24:29.840]  Okay.
[3:24:29.840 --> 3:24:31.840]  Pretty sure that's not what oil is.
[3:24:31.840 --> 3:24:36.840]  But these people still, everybody still uses this terminology as if that's what it is.
[3:24:36.840 --> 3:24:37.840]  It's crushed up dinosaurs.
[3:24:37.840 --> 3:24:39.840]  I really believe that.
[3:24:39.840 --> 3:24:43.840]  I don't know what oil is, something bio genetic or something like that.
[3:24:43.840 --> 3:24:54.840]  Regardless, he says, science will have to tell us how to settle this process that's kind of going haywire.
[3:24:54.840 --> 3:25:01.840]  And we need to have some kind of balance between the relationship that man has to nature that's out of whack.
[3:25:01.840 --> 3:25:05.840]  And of course, he blames owning property.
[3:25:05.840 --> 3:25:08.840]  He blames individualism.
[3:25:08.840 --> 3:25:10.840]  And he blames rights.
[3:25:10.840 --> 3:25:13.840]  It's true that those things can be exaggerated, right?
[3:25:13.840 --> 3:25:20.840]  We might have a situation where we're overly individualistic and, you know, we say screw everybody else.
[3:25:20.840 --> 3:25:29.840]  You know, you know, some kind of crazy, I don't know, John Galt situation where we're just going to let everything go to go to heck to crap and have a breakaway civilization.
[3:25:29.840 --> 3:25:30.840]  Right.
[3:25:30.840 --> 3:25:31.840]  That's one side of the dialectic.
[3:25:31.840 --> 3:25:38.840]  And then the other side of the and ran John Galt dialectic is the other people like freedom of copper who pretend to be the opposite.
[3:25:38.840 --> 3:25:40.840]  You know, it's not about the individual.
[3:25:40.840 --> 3:25:41.840]  It's about the collective.
[3:25:41.840 --> 3:25:42.840]  We all need to be one.
[3:25:42.840 --> 3:25:44.840]  We're all truly deep down.
[3:25:44.840 --> 3:25:45.840]  Just one.
[3:25:45.840 --> 3:25:48.840]  You need to dissolve your identity as an individual into the one.
[3:25:48.840 --> 3:25:52.840]  Now, in Christianity, again, I think why they have such a problem with the system.
[3:25:52.840 --> 3:25:54.840]  There's a balance between the one and the many.
[3:25:54.840 --> 3:25:55.840]  That's the doctrine of the Trinity.
[3:25:55.840 --> 3:25:57.840]  But that's a separate issue.
[3:25:57.840 --> 3:26:04.840]  Going back to this, he says, no, no, no, we've been too far into individualism.
[3:26:04.840 --> 3:26:10.840]  And he says that we haven't listened to Malthus, he actually mentions Malthus on page 35.
[3:26:10.840 --> 3:26:16.840]  And he says that it's time to swing the pendulum back towards monism and realize that we're all collectivist.
[3:26:16.840 --> 3:26:18.840]  And he says that Taoist philosophy.
[3:26:18.840 --> 3:26:20.840]  He says Taoism.
[3:26:20.840 --> 3:26:23.840]  He speaks of like Chinese philosophy.
[3:26:23.840 --> 3:26:25.840]  It says Taoism, Confucianism.
[3:26:25.840 --> 3:26:32.840]  He says, these can be things that will enlighten us to understand that we've been too individualistic.
[3:26:32.840 --> 3:26:36.840]  And we need to really just dissolve ourselves into the collective.
[3:26:36.840 --> 3:26:46.840]  Now, another interesting book that ties directly into this from the same power structure is the lesser known Aldous Huxley book, Perennial Philosophy.
[3:26:46.840 --> 3:26:48.840]  And Aldous Huxley wrote this book.
[3:26:48.840 --> 3:26:58.840]  Of course, he was, you know, very important in the whole British establishment's promotion of hallucinogens prior to the LSD Revolution of the 60s.
[3:26:58.840 --> 3:27:01.840]  You know, Huxley was promoting this stuff back in the 40s and 50s.
[3:27:01.840 --> 3:27:09.840]  And it's very, very possible too that Alistair Crowley might have also played a role in this by influencing Huxley through Crowley's drug diaries.
[3:27:09.840 --> 3:27:17.840]  So if you don't know Crowley wrote diaries of a drug fiend and this was kind of his experiences and recounting what happens to people on various drugs.
[3:27:17.840 --> 3:27:29.840]  Some people like Dr. Richard Spence theorizes as well that that might have actually influenced Huxley to think, well, hey, why don't we weaponize the hallucinogens stuff and see if we can change culture with this.
[3:27:29.840 --> 3:27:36.840]  It ties in well with the British establishment promotion of Hindu philosophy and the gurus and the swamis.
[3:27:36.840 --> 3:27:44.840]  You see the connection. And why would that be? Well, the British establishment knew Hindu philosophy very well because India was a colony.
[3:27:44.840 --> 3:27:50.840]  And they had studied that caste system in depth to, you know, to manage one of their colonies.
[3:27:50.840 --> 3:28:03.840]  And what better system to promote the Darwinian social Darwin philosophy, social Darwinist philosophy of getting rid of most of the people than the caste system.
[3:28:03.840 --> 3:28:09.840]  And by the way, if you don't know, the radical Darwinian philosophy is an ancient Hindu philosophy, right?
[3:28:09.840 --> 3:28:16.840]  Evolutionary philosophy is not new with Darwin or even the Greeks who had a version of this actually goes back to ancient Indian philosophy.
[3:28:16.840 --> 3:28:23.840]  And this is where you get the scale of being and that some people are born into a, you know, they basically have no value, this kind of a thing.
[3:28:23.840 --> 3:28:30.840]  Well, clearly that is applicable to the philosophy of the Malthusians and the British establishment.
[3:28:30.840 --> 3:28:39.840]  So they find that very useful. That's the source of all of these far Eastern Hindu New Age philosophies being promoted by design in the West.
[3:28:39.840 --> 3:28:45.840]  And these people tell you that now he's not a Hindu, but it's the same idea. It's the same idea.
[3:28:45.840 --> 3:28:52.840]  It's the idea of the individual merging into the big collective. And that's exactly what this whole book is about by Huxley, right?
[3:28:52.840 --> 3:28:56.840]  Don't go anywhere. This is the Alex Jones show. I'm Jay Dyer, guest host.
[3:28:56.840 --> 3:29:02.840]  At this point, best case scenario is a few years of hard times for us all.
[3:29:02.840 --> 3:29:06.840]  And if we don't turn it around soon, then it will only get worse.
[3:29:06.840 --> 3:29:11.840]  But as bad as things are, we still have time to prepare.
[3:29:11.840 --> 3:29:18.840]  And that alone is something to be grateful for. A gravity water filter will provide you with clean, healthy water,
[3:29:18.840 --> 3:29:27.840]  even in the event of your taps getting shut off. And having your own food will save you from getting ensnared in government FEMA camps.
[3:29:27.840 --> 3:29:34.840]  And if you've already stocked up enough for your own family, you might want to consider stocking up for your neighbors.
[3:29:34.840 --> 3:29:44.840]  Some of your neighbors might not be prepared for what's coming, but you can help them by having an abundance of storable foods and water filtration.
[3:29:44.840 --> 3:29:49.840]  Whoever sews bountifully will also reap bountifully.

[3:31:32.840 --> 3:31:38.840]  One of the most important things you can make is to have high quality, storable food, water filtration, air filtration and more.
[3:31:38.840 --> 3:31:45.840]  And it's not just those items, it's hundreds of other high quality, preparedness items and survival items right now at PrepareWithAlex.com.

[3:31:50.840 --> 3:31:55.840]  One of the most important things you can do is get ahead of inflation now because the inflation is just beginning.
[3:31:55.840 --> 3:32:00.840]  There's an old Bedouin saying that's thousands of years old and it goes like this.
[3:32:00.840 --> 3:32:03.840]  Trust in God, but tie up your camel.
[3:32:03.840 --> 3:32:05.840]  Hunter S. Thompson put it this way.
[3:32:05.840 --> 3:32:07.840]  Pray to God, but roll away from the rocks.
[3:32:07.840 --> 3:32:14.840]  If your boat is going towards the rocks, pray to God that you don't get smashed on him and killed, but also try to roll away.
[3:32:14.840 --> 3:32:18.840]  You can't just sit there like a jellyfish. And it's the same thing with our immune system.
[3:32:18.840 --> 3:32:20.840]  God helps those who help themselves.

[3:32:54.840 --> 3:33:03.840]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:10.840 --> 3:33:15.840]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[3:33:15.840 --> 3:33:22.840]  We are talking about the fascinating book by one of the globalists, Freetalk Capra himself.
[3:33:22.840 --> 3:33:35.840]  And Freetalk is a deep ecologist, a big promoter of the Earth Charter, a big promoter of the idea that we need to have a global collectivism to solve mankind's problems.
[3:33:35.840 --> 3:33:51.840]  Now, I will say that one thing that did kind of surprise me is that he does a very thorough critique at the beginning of the book of scientism and the overemphasis on materialism, the rationalism of Descartes.
[3:33:51.840 --> 3:33:54.840]  All of which was pretty good, I have to admit.
[3:33:54.840 --> 3:34:03.840]  But the problem is that he then ends it by saying that, you know, what we got to get away from is the individual thinking that he has an existence of his own mind.
[3:34:03.840 --> 3:34:09.840]  If you don't know, Descartes is a famous Enlightenment philosopher who said, Kogito ergo sum, I think therefore I am.
[3:34:09.840 --> 3:34:17.840]  And he says, that's the probably the root issue in Western thought since the Enlightenment is the idea of the individual kind of being the starting point.
[3:34:17.840 --> 3:34:23.840]  Now, I don't agree with Descartes exactly, but I do think there are individuals and I do think we have individual rights.
[3:34:23.840 --> 3:34:29.840]  And so my problem isn't with that, but rather that the solution is the problem.
[3:34:29.840 --> 3:34:34.840]  And a lot of the global elite books, when you read them, you'll notice they actually identify quite a few legitimate problems.
[3:34:34.840 --> 3:34:40.840]  So the problem with their books isn't identifying problems, it's their horrible solutions.
[3:34:40.840 --> 3:34:44.840]  They always identify real problems and a lot of times they started those problems.
[3:34:44.840 --> 3:34:51.840]  Right.
[3:34:51.840 --> 3:34:57.840]  So as he moves on to critique scientists and he says, let me give you a new paradigm, let me give you a new way to look at reality.
[3:34:57.840 --> 3:35:10.840]  And he has interesting critiques of Western views of science and Newton and this kind of stuff as he moves through the next few chapters, working his way up to quantum physics.
[3:35:10.840 --> 3:35:18.840]  Now, I don't necessarily have a problem with quantum physics. I'm not a quantum physicist or mathematician, but approaching from a philosophical perspective.
[3:35:18.840 --> 3:35:30.840]  One of the problems I have is that a lot of times quantum physics gets co-opted and turned into political social engineering means and mechanisms for this kind of new age stuff.
[3:35:30.840 --> 3:35:37.840]  Right. And so it ends up being a political thing telling you that, oh, by the way, quantum foam, so you don't have individual rights.
[3:35:37.840 --> 3:35:42.840]  You don't exist individual because of quantum foam. Oh, by the way, quantum physics.
[3:35:42.840 --> 3:35:47.840]  Oh, the cat in the box and we don't know if he's alive or dead, so you don't exist as an individual.
[3:35:47.840 --> 3:35:56.840]  Right. It's like all of these non sequiturs, non, that doesn't follow from the fact, right, that, you know, because of some experiment that Schrodinger did that.
[3:35:56.840 --> 3:36:04.840]  Oh, no, actually, you don't exist as an individual and we don't know what exists and who knows, right, about anything being true or false.
[3:36:04.840 --> 3:36:17.840]  It immediately gets co-opted into far Eastern contradictory dialectical philosophy where we can accept the contradictions, as the Guru would say.
[3:36:17.840 --> 3:36:19.840]  So where's he going with this?
[3:36:19.840 --> 3:36:28.840]  Let me tell you the new physics based on quantum mechanics and all this kind of stuff is that Gaia is alive.
[3:36:28.840 --> 3:36:37.840]  By the way, if all this contradictory stuff is true, then isn't it also both good and bad to have individual rights?
[3:36:37.840 --> 3:36:42.840]  You see what I'm saying? You see, if you accept contradictions, then on the basis is, is it bad?
[3:36:42.840 --> 3:36:48.840]  All of the stuff in the first three chapters that he critiqued, why is that bad if contradictions are true?
[3:36:48.840 --> 3:36:53.840]  If contradictions are true, nothing is good or bad. You see how silly this is.
[3:36:53.840 --> 3:37:00.840]  Well, biology shows us that chaos leads to order. Physics shows us that order leads to chaos.
[3:37:00.840 --> 3:37:07.840]  And so, actually, Newton and Darwin are both right and both wrong and reality is quantum, bro.
[3:37:07.840 --> 3:37:12.840]  And if it's quantum and everything is true and everything's false at the same time.
[3:37:12.840 --> 3:37:14.840]  So it turns into debris. That's the point here.
[3:37:14.840 --> 3:37:25.840]  Immediately it goes from interesting critiques to nonsensical incoherent mysticism, exactly where he takes it.
[3:37:25.840 --> 3:37:35.840]  If he can convince us of incoherent mysticism, then he kind of can step in as the guru who kind of becomes the voice of truth itself.
[3:37:35.840 --> 3:37:39.840]  So no longer is reality rational, meaningful, and coherent.
[3:37:39.840 --> 3:37:47.840]  Now it's completely irrational and the source of meaning and coherence and truth becomes the guru himself.
[3:37:47.840 --> 3:37:54.840]  So I see copper as kind of an interjecting himself here in this point as a kind of a scientific guru, so to speak.
[3:37:54.840 --> 3:37:56.840]  It's what he's trying to do here.
[3:37:56.840 --> 3:38:05.840]  And he really thinks that he can give us a new paradigm based on the electromagnetic current, based on quantum physics,
[3:38:05.840 --> 3:38:13.840]  based on the matrix simulation theory. And interestingly, he goes right into simulation theory and says that because we live in a simulation,
[3:38:13.840 --> 3:38:21.840]  if we just meditate hard enough, we can figure out, you know, how to train.
[3:38:21.840 --> 3:38:31.840]  It then goes on to say that the new paradigm is going to be one that the elites will re-engineer through every area of society.
[3:38:31.840 --> 3:38:39.840]  Oh, wait a minute. I thought that we thought we were rotating to get to reality.
[3:38:39.840 --> 3:38:42.840]  I thought we were getting, meditating on nature. No, no.
[3:38:42.840 --> 3:38:46.840]  Now we need a new way to approach medicine, he says.
[3:38:46.840 --> 3:38:50.840]  Again, that kind of sounds okay, a new way to approach that.
[3:38:50.840 --> 3:38:56.840]  But then he starts saying, loveless in his medical sections, and he says that the new order of the ages,
[3:38:56.840 --> 3:39:02.840]  this new world order that we've been waiting for, will actually come about through medicine.
[3:39:02.840 --> 3:39:07.840]  Oh, way ahead of its time, especially given what happened the last two years with COOF,
[3:39:07.840 --> 3:39:15.840]  especially with transhumanist virus software men like Gil Bates, suddenly telling us what medicine is.
[3:39:15.840 --> 3:39:26.840]  Right now, I mean, it's exactly what Khritov said back in 1982. He says medicine will become a backdoor by which the new world order,
[3:39:26.840 --> 3:39:33.840]  the new order of the ages would come in. He says that the entire social and cultural world will be transformed,
[3:39:33.840 --> 3:39:37.840]  changing images of men, and that will be key.
[3:39:37.840 --> 3:39:47.840]  So one way that we'll do this is through the promotion, through psychology, through psychopharmacology,
[3:39:47.840 --> 3:39:55.840]  of new mystical experiences. And he even mentions the new age movement, LSD,
[3:39:55.840 --> 3:40:01.840]  and how the new age would promote deep ecology and a new religion almost.
[3:40:01.840 --> 3:40:09.840]  He says everything that was fractured since the Enlightenment and its atomistic philosophy broken down,
[3:40:09.840 --> 3:40:15.840]  he says will now be reintegrated, this is the alchemical process of breaking things down,
[3:40:15.840 --> 3:40:21.840]  and then coagulating them back together in a new process, breaking down and then building back up.
[3:40:21.840 --> 3:40:33.840]  He says everything that was fractured will now be reintegrated.
[3:40:33.840 --> 3:41:01.840]  I know many parents with very young children have been anticipating this day.
[3:41:01.840 --> 3:41:06.840]  We now know based on rigorous scientific review that the vaccines available here in the United States
[3:41:06.840 --> 3:41:10.840]  can be used safely and effectively in children under 5.
[3:41:10.840 --> 3:41:18.840]  Vaccinating young children is a critical opportunity to protect them against hospitalization and death from COVID-19.
[3:41:18.840 --> 3:41:23.840]  Parents, I strongly encourage you to get your children vaccinated.
[3:41:23.840 --> 3:41:33.840]  The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines involve the radical new mRNA technology that we now know is spreading throughout the entire body,
[3:41:33.840 --> 3:41:39.840]  and altering the person's DNA.
[3:41:39.840 --> 3:41:47.840]  Thousands of medical doctors have been speaking out about this, including one of the inventors of mRNA technology.
[3:41:47.840 --> 3:41:53.840]  Several nations have suspended these vaccines due to serious injuries and deaths,
[3:41:53.840 --> 3:42:01.840]  and yet we are still being lied to by our own government who wants us to sacrifice our youngest children.
[3:42:01.840 --> 3:42:05.840]  My name is Dr. Ashish Jha and I am the White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator.
[3:42:05.840 --> 3:42:07.840]  I have some really exciting news.
[3:42:07.840 --> 3:42:12.840]  The FDA and the CDC just authorized vaccines for kids under 5.
[3:42:12.840 --> 3:42:17.840]  These vaccines are incredibly safe. They work to prevent serious illness.
[3:42:17.840 --> 3:42:21.840]  That's why I have gotten all three of my children vaccinated,
[3:42:21.840 --> 3:42:27.840]  and now if you're a parent of a kid under 5, it's a great time to go out and get your child protected.
[3:42:27.840 --> 3:42:29.840]  Get them vaccinated.
[3:42:29.840 --> 3:42:38.840]  The White House's official doctor has claimed that these vaccines are incredibly safe, which we know is a lie.
[3:42:38.840 --> 3:42:47.840]  There are more deadly side effects attributed to the COVID-19 vaccines than with any other vaccine in history.
[3:42:47.840 --> 3:43:09.840]  From severe allergic reactions to full-blown AIDS and sudden death.
[3:43:18.840 --> 3:43:21.840]  It's now out in the open.
[3:43:21.840 --> 3:43:27.840]  Klaus Schwab said last week that they rule the Earth, the Bilderberg group founded Davos Group.
[3:43:27.840 --> 3:43:33.840]  So now the fight's out in the open. They're making their move because they know they're behind schedule.
[3:43:33.840 --> 3:43:34.840]  We're going to win this thing.
[3:43:34.840 --> 3:43:36.840]  God's watching the children counting on us.
[3:43:36.840 --> 3:43:41.840]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and your financial support,
[3:43:41.840 --> 3:43:43.840]  because without you, Info Wars would not be here.
[3:43:43.840 --> 3:43:50.840]  I want you to really internalize the fact that you are the Info War and you are the reason humanity has a fighting chance.
[3:43:50.840 --> 3:43:55.840]  So I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done and ask you now to redouble your efforts.
[3:43:55.840 --> 3:44:02.840]  I want to take a minute out to address the viewers and listeners of Info Wars and to remind you that we've been vindicated
[3:44:02.840 --> 3:44:08.840]  and that world government and its tyrannical aim of depopulation is now out of the open.
[3:44:08.840 --> 3:44:15.840]  Everything you and I have done together has been historic and we cannot continue in this fight without your support.
[3:44:15.840 --> 3:44:19.840]  I want to encourage you all to be part of this dream right now, while you still can,
[3:44:19.840 --> 3:44:24.840]  to get the third and final coin in the founding member coin series.

[3:44:35.840 --> 3:44:42.840]  and know you helped Info War stay on air at the most critical time in our 28 year history.
[3:44:42.840 --> 3:44:46.840]  So I want to thank you all for your support and I want to encourage you all to be part of history
[3:44:46.840 --> 3:44:55.840]  and to get this historic memento that keeps us on air at infowarstore.com or 1776coin.com while you still can.
[3:44:55.840 --> 3:45:03.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, in the last 30 months we've witnessed the globalists hit humanity and hit humanity extremely hard.

[3:46:56.840 --> 3:47:01.840]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[3:47:01.840 --> 3:47:04.840]  It's Alex Jones.
[3:47:10.840 --> 3:47:12.840]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:47:12.840 --> 3:47:17.840]  We're covering the book by Fritov Kopra Turning Point and we were just getting to the sections
[3:47:17.840 --> 3:47:22.840]  where he talks about how the entire social dynamic, entire culture will have to be transformed
[3:47:22.840 --> 3:47:27.840]  from the inside out via the agents of change and via the foundations that he mentions.
[3:47:27.840 --> 3:47:31.840]  By the way, he mentions the Rockefeller Foundation as cited in the book itself.
[3:47:31.840 --> 3:47:36.840]  He says that this will come about through psychopharmacology and the medical industry,
[3:47:36.840 --> 3:47:43.840]  big pharma essentially, promoting the idea of mystical experiences and pharmaceuticals.
[3:47:43.840 --> 3:47:48.840]  And he says that we will continue with the counter-cultural revolution of the 60s
[3:47:48.840 --> 3:47:53.840]  and his promotion of the hallucinogenic drugs and whatnot to promote the new agenda,
[3:47:53.840 --> 3:47:58.840]  the new way to understand reality because everybody will see themselves as integrated
[3:47:58.840 --> 3:48:02.840]  and reintegrated into the collective whole.
[3:48:02.840 --> 3:48:08.840]  So he says that what enlightenment philosophy broke down through its atomistic materialistic philosophy,
[3:48:08.840 --> 3:48:11.840]  he says will now be reintegrated into the whole.
[3:48:11.840 --> 3:48:14.840]  And this is literally an alchemical process.
[3:48:14.840 --> 3:48:17.840]  So if you don't know, alchemy has the stages where you break something down
[3:48:17.840 --> 3:48:22.840]  and then you coagulate it, you bring it back together in the new form that you wanted.
[3:48:22.840 --> 3:48:27.840]  And that is the philosophy that the people like Fritov Kopra are basing their system on.
[3:48:27.840 --> 3:48:34.840]  They're operating this in their game plan where he says that we will now reintegrate man into a new collective whole
[3:48:34.840 --> 3:48:40.840]  where he doesn't have any individual identity beyond what the social engineers and the elite tell them.
[3:48:40.840 --> 3:48:45.840]  The next chapter, after the medical chapter, he says that there's a dark side to growth and expansion.
[3:48:45.840 --> 3:48:48.840]  Now we got to bring in limits to growth.
[3:48:48.840 --> 3:48:50.840]  We got to bring in austerity.
[3:48:50.840 --> 3:48:58.840]  And limits to growth will be basically inculcated into the masses through cultural engineering, social engineering.
[3:48:58.840 --> 3:49:01.840]  Growth must cease, he says.
[3:49:01.840 --> 3:49:04.840]  He says we have to reconcile ourselves to death.
[3:49:04.840 --> 3:49:06.840]  Death is good, death is natural.
[3:49:06.840 --> 3:49:12.840]  And as soon as we realize that death is natural and we are okay with death, then we can depopulate.
[3:49:12.840 --> 3:49:15.840]  We can begin to convince people to depopulate.
[3:49:15.840 --> 3:49:22.840]  The new physics, he says, will unify all of the cultures in a holistic way so that we'll now have a new world culture order.
[3:49:22.840 --> 3:49:25.840]  That's his chapter, literally.
[3:49:25.840 --> 3:49:32.840]  The whole chapter of the soul page is on a new world order, the new vision of reality.
[3:49:32.840 --> 3:49:40.840]  And I think what really surprised me was that he actually goes into, I don't remember if you guys have not seen my lecture that I did on Arthur Kessler's book,
[3:49:40.840 --> 3:49:44.840]  Ghost in the Machine, he goes into quite a bit of citations of Kessler.
[3:49:44.840 --> 3:49:51.840]  He goes into the Holons, which is this idea that Kessler had about systems in nature operating in a holistic way.
[3:49:51.840 --> 3:49:52.840]  Now there's some truth to that.
[3:49:52.840 --> 3:49:58.840]  Yeah, I mean, like, you know, trees and branches and root systems are holistic and they connect together.
[3:49:58.840 --> 3:49:59.840]  Okay, that's fine.
[3:49:59.840 --> 3:50:11.840]  But that doesn't mean that as a human being, I need to just be viewed as a tree or an ant or, you know, a bee in the bee colony or the beehive or whatever, the ant colony.
[3:50:11.840 --> 3:50:13.840]  And I don't have any individual existence, right?
[3:50:13.840 --> 3:50:18.840]  Because the whole thing is assuming that I'm just an animal, you're just an animal.
[3:50:18.840 --> 3:50:22.840]  And so we don't have any existence that's more important than animals, according to him.
[3:50:22.840 --> 3:50:29.840]  He says that in order to inculcate this holistic monistic philosophy where nobody has individual identity,
[3:50:29.840 --> 3:50:40.840]  and we're all just part of the one man is things like shamanism, shamanistic initiations, transformational festivals,
[3:50:40.840 --> 3:50:42.840]  things like Burning Man.
[3:50:42.840 --> 3:50:44.840]  No, I mean, I'm not a prude.
[3:50:44.840 --> 3:50:46.840]  I don't think it's a big deal if you have a festival or go to a festival.
[3:50:46.840 --> 3:50:56.840]  But he's saying that festivals will be the means by which we can inculcate a new spirituality, a globalist version of spirituality,
[3:50:56.840 --> 3:51:03.840]  where people will focus on wholism to the exclusion of individual identity.
[3:51:03.840 --> 3:51:12.840]  Again, the very thing that mega social engineer Aldous Huxley, brother of Julian Huxley, who wrote UNESCO's philosophy,
[3:51:12.840 --> 3:51:15.840]  which is all about a new one world order.
[3:51:15.840 --> 3:51:19.840]  A new one world order requires a one world religion.
[3:51:19.840 --> 3:51:25.840]  Shamanism, Burning Man, integrate yourself into the whole, bro.
[3:51:25.840 --> 3:51:27.840]  We're all one, man.
[3:51:27.840 --> 3:51:30.840]  That's exactly what he's talking about.
[3:51:30.840 --> 3:51:36.840]  The most surprising section of the book, I couldn't believe this, was where he goes into citing the MKLTRA doctors.
[3:51:36.840 --> 3:51:42.840]  Not in a bad way, but like, we didn't listen to these MKLTRA doctors because they figured it out.
[3:51:42.840 --> 3:51:50.840]  What this proves, this book pro proves to us is that the MKLTRA doctors, their research was not just about individuals.
[3:51:50.840 --> 3:51:58.840]  It actually was about large scale social engineering, getting people to buy into this collectivist delusion.
[3:51:58.840 --> 3:52:03.840]  And he says that we need to listen to people like Dr. Gregory Bateson, who is famous as an MKLTRA doctor,
[3:52:03.840 --> 3:52:11.840]  who said, we need to capture mankind's imagination, not just his rational mind, but also his imagination to really control him.
[3:52:11.840 --> 3:52:18.840]  Well, Fredauff Copper says that we need to inculcate mystical practices, all of these initiations.
[3:52:18.840 --> 3:52:19.840]  This is the craziest part.
[3:52:19.840 --> 3:52:23.840]  He says that we need to take the research of these doctors, these MKLTRA doctors.
[3:52:23.840 --> 3:52:30.840]  We need to have a mass initiation of the masses, mass initiation of the masses.
[3:52:30.840 --> 3:52:38.840]  And he says that even studies in dissociation, that's mind control schizo stuff, he says initiation ceremonies
[3:52:38.840 --> 3:52:47.840]  and what we've learned in the research of NPD DID, the research into psychosis, the research into LSD,
[3:52:47.840 --> 3:52:53.840]  there's a whole chapter on this, and psychedelics, he says when those are on a mass scale promoted everybody.
[3:52:53.840 --> 3:53:00.840]  Now, I'm not really talking about here what the hippie culture does with getting LSD and this kind of stuff.
[3:53:00.840 --> 3:53:03.840]  That was just like the old version of what they were studying.
[3:53:03.840 --> 3:53:07.840]  And they gave out a lot of that through Tim Leary, the CIS, back in the 60s.
[3:53:07.840 --> 3:53:11.840]  But this is more so what the big pharmaceutical companies are up to.
[3:53:11.840 --> 3:53:16.840]  That's the real drug in the population, not so much the people smoking weed in the hippies.
[3:53:16.840 --> 3:53:23.840]  The real drugging of the population is the big pharmaceutical companies mandating now,
[3:53:23.840 --> 3:53:28.840]  oh, now you have to get these drug shots, these kinds of things, right?
[3:53:28.840 --> 3:53:31.840]  And I mean, the mRNA stuff, that's just another version of this.
[3:53:31.840 --> 3:53:37.840]  Now, I mean, I know that's not a psychedelic, but that's attempting to change your very DNA and biology.
[3:53:37.840 --> 3:53:47.840]  And what Frito Capricorn is talking about is him is changing your mental processes through the psychedelics, right?
[3:53:47.840 --> 3:53:49.840]  And I'm not trying to be a pruder.
[3:53:49.840 --> 3:53:54.840]  There may be a legitimate use of psychedelics in medical situations.
[3:53:54.840 --> 3:53:55.840]  I don't have any hard opinions on that.
[3:53:55.840 --> 3:53:57.840]  I'm not saying that it's all bad, right?
[3:53:57.840 --> 3:53:59.840]  I mean, God gave us these things.
[3:53:59.840 --> 3:54:06.840]  There might be medical situations where people in extreme cases, I had a friend who was a severe alcoholic,
[3:54:06.840 --> 3:54:09.840]  and it was discussed at one point.
[3:54:09.840 --> 3:54:13.840]  Maybe he should go try out one of these things where people do, you know, peyote or something.
[3:54:13.840 --> 3:54:17.840]  I'm not saying that, I mean, in an extreme case here, maybe.
[3:54:17.840 --> 3:54:20.840]  Maybe that's something that nothing else seemed to work for that guy.
[3:54:20.840 --> 3:54:29.840]  But to promote this to the masses through the top-down pharmaceutical thing,
[3:54:29.840 --> 3:54:31.840]  that to me doesn't sound like a good idea.
[3:54:31.840 --> 3:54:36.840]  That sounds like social engineering, and that's exactly what Frito says.
[3:54:36.840 --> 3:54:37.840]  I keep calling him all these guys.
[3:54:37.840 --> 3:54:39.840]  It used to be a ridiculous name, right?
[3:54:39.840 --> 3:54:43.840]  But if you listen to him, he sounds like Arnold Schwarzenegger with helium, right?
[3:54:43.840 --> 3:54:45.840]  If you listen to a talk that...
[3:54:45.840 --> 3:54:47.840]  It sounds like this.
[3:54:47.840 --> 3:54:50.840]  With a high-pitched anode, we need to integrate.
[3:54:50.840 --> 3:54:52.840]  Unless this is the masses.
[3:54:52.840 --> 3:54:55.840]  Oh, yeah.
[3:54:55.840 --> 3:54:59.840]  He even ends the book by saying that we need to bring in goddess worship.
[3:54:59.840 --> 3:55:01.840]  That was kind of surprising.
[3:55:01.840 --> 3:55:03.840]  He said, oh, we've been too masculine.
[3:55:03.840 --> 3:55:09.840]  Oh, we've been too masculine in the West, and we've had the dominance of masculine patriarchal thinking,
[3:55:09.840 --> 3:55:11.840]  and we need to bring the goddess in.
[3:55:11.840 --> 3:55:13.840]  We need to bring the goddess in.
[3:55:13.840 --> 3:55:16.840]  Why are these people telling us what we need to do?
[3:55:16.840 --> 3:55:18.840]  I mean, why are we listening to these people?
[3:55:18.840 --> 3:55:21.840]  And he even goes on to talk about the 60-CIA hippie counterculture.
[3:55:21.840 --> 3:55:22.840]  He says, no.
[3:55:22.840 --> 3:55:24.840]  That is the future.
[3:55:24.840 --> 3:55:26.840]  That's the future.
[3:55:26.840 --> 3:55:34.840]  Again, this book shows that here's somebody from the high, high levels of the eco-green controlled movement
[3:55:34.840 --> 3:55:37.840]  funded by all the biggest foundations in the world.
[3:55:37.840 --> 3:55:44.840]  Here he is saying, let me tell you the real usage of the 60s counterculture,
[3:55:44.840 --> 3:55:47.840]  the mass-drugging of the populace, mainly through Big Pharma.
[3:55:47.840 --> 3:55:50.840]  Again, he's not talking about the counterculture people.
[3:55:50.840 --> 3:55:54.840]  He's saying that was the old way of testing it out.
[3:55:54.840 --> 3:56:00.840]  He's saying the Big Pharma medical establishment is really going to be the means by which
[3:56:00.840 --> 3:56:03.840]  this is inculcated to the masses.
[3:56:03.840 --> 3:56:04.840]  Okay?
[3:56:04.840 --> 3:56:07.840]  Do you see how important this is?
[3:56:07.840 --> 3:56:14.840]  And he again ends the book by citing Gregory Bateson, the famous M. Kiltra doctor,
[3:56:14.840 --> 3:56:24.840]  all these CIA mind control people, they're all the source and the heart of the new age hippie stuff,
[3:56:24.840 --> 3:56:27.840]  not in its origins, but in its mass inculcation.
[3:56:27.840 --> 3:56:29.840]  You see what I'm saying here?
[3:56:29.840 --> 3:56:34.840]  So we go back 120 years to Blavatsky, Basant, Crowley.
[3:56:34.840 --> 3:56:40.840]  Those are the kind of revolutionary figures in terms of individual thoughts about what the future would be
[3:56:40.840 --> 3:56:43.840]  in terms of magic and new age and this kind of stuff.
[3:56:43.840 --> 3:56:49.840]  But they didn't have enough power in following on their own until entities like the United Nations
[3:56:49.840 --> 3:56:55.840]  picked up the philosophy of Blavatsky through the Lucifer Publishing House, now renamed the Lucis Trust,
[3:56:55.840 --> 3:56:59.840]  to promote to all the world this philosophy.
[3:56:59.840 --> 3:57:07.840]  And then to pay off these people by the Big Foundation money to promote this stuff in every area of life.
[3:57:07.840 --> 3:57:10.840]  So that's why there's gurus everywhere.
[3:57:10.840 --> 3:57:15.840]  By the way, if you want to go deeper into this, I have a lecture that goes through the whole of that book.
[3:57:15.840 --> 3:57:18.840]  I just did a lecture the other day on occult spies.
[3:57:18.840 --> 3:57:21.840]  Go to my YouTube channel, you'll see the very top video, occult spies.
[3:57:21.840 --> 3:57:32.840]  I'm going to be going through gurus in the next few weeks, lecturing through the hottest, weirdest, creepiest gurus out there on the world stage.
[3:57:32.840 --> 3:57:38.840]  And I have a new book out that I'm taking pre-orders for, which we get into Nietzsche, we get into Dostoevsky, we get into all of that.
[3:57:38.840 --> 3:57:40.840]  You go to my website right there, you'll see that book there.
[3:57:40.840 --> 3:57:44.840]  Meta-narratives, essays in philosophy at Jay's Analysis.
[3:57:44.840 --> 3:58:12.840]  Pre-orders.
[3:58:12.840 --> 3:58:17.840]  The new film, the seminal film, the most important documentary ever made in my view.
[3:58:17.840 --> 3:58:25.840]  2000 Mules is now available on DVD with expanded extras at infowarsstore.com.
[3:58:25.840 --> 3:58:31.840]  You can also get the powerful film with other documentaries discounted at infowarsstore.com.
[3:58:31.840 --> 3:58:34.840]  Everyone needs this DVD in their library to show everyone you know.
[3:58:34.840 --> 3:58:37.840]  We have the tools to bring these criminals to justice.
[3:58:37.840 --> 3:58:42.840]  If they're planning to run the same scams again, this film can stop them if you take action.
[3:58:42.840 --> 3:58:45.840]  infowarsstore.com, 2000 Mules.
[3:58:45.840 --> 3:58:51.840]  The first ten amendments to our country's constitution were adopted in 1791.
[3:58:51.840 --> 3:58:56.840]  The first of these broadly protects the rights of free speech and free press.
[3:58:56.840 --> 3:59:05.840]  Free speech means the free and public expression of opinions without censorship, interference, and restraint by the government.
[3:59:05.840 --> 3:59:12.840]  Two hundred and thirty-one years later, free speech across America is under chronic and insidious attack.
[3:59:12.840 --> 3:59:14.840]  GCN is under attack.
[3:59:14.840 --> 3:59:19.840]  Your freedom is currently under siege from those who do not want you to know the truth.
[3:59:19.840 --> 3:59:27.840]  I'm asking our fellow broadcasters and you to rise up and help us defend our right to continue telling you the truth.
