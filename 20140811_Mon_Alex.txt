[00:00:00.287 --> 00:00:01.129]  Let's do this!
[00:00:05.017 --> 00:00:06.318]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.318 --> 00:00:08.079]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.079 --> 00:00:09.840]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.442]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.442 --> 00:00:12.983]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.983 --> 00:00:17.166]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:28.214]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.214 --> 00:00:30.695]  We're going to be covering the latest
[00:00:31.836 --> 00:00:53.186]  ...event that will be used like Trayvon Martin to promote racial division in this country, and to make that the only issue, not the globalists that are literally de-industrializing the country and artificially creating a climate of poverty as a tool of social control.
[00:00:53.186 --> 00:01:00.330]  We will get into that today, but there is so much, so many other important stories that we've got to get to.
[00:01:01.368 --> 00:01:28.326]  And yes, now Trayvon Martin's family attorney is to represent the slain Missouri teen and InfoWars.com has discovered tweeted photos taken by citizens in Ferguson, Missouri of looters wearing Remember Trayvon Martin, Rest in Peace Trayvon Martin shirts.
[00:01:28.326 --> 00:01:29.687]  So the answer
[00:01:30.953 --> 00:01:45.539]  When the police questionably shoot an unarmed black teen is not to burn down grocery stores and convenience stores and people's houses and to burn up cars in your own neighborhood.
[00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:52.462]  The answer would be to get politically involved and go after the police department if they've been proven wrong.
[00:01:53.854 --> 00:02:02.680]  But doing stuff like this will only make the relations between the police and the black community that much worse.
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.443]  And this is just a little forte, a little hors d'oeuvre.
[00:02:08.012 --> 00:02:23.179]  In the future of this nation, especially when the media like MSNBC and the White House only have race baiting and racial politics as their issues.
[00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:26.521]  Because they're not delivering on any other front.
[00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:29.622]  They're not delivering jobs, they're not even delivering bigger welfare checks.
[00:02:29.622 --> 00:02:30.903]  They're just delivering collapse.
[00:02:32.554 --> 00:02:40.891]  And their own people, that have gotten basically raised on welfare across the political spectrum, are getting antsy, are getting restless.
[00:02:40.891 --> 00:02:43.436]  And the answer is, let's just have a war with the police.
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:54.743]  Which is only going to then have the police be driven into the arms of the feds, who are really globalist and have been occupied by the New World Order.
[00:02:54.743 --> 00:03:06.588]  They will then federalize the police, create federal command centers, militarize them, and then they will bait and switch and use the paramilitary police on gun owners, returning veterans, Christians, conservatives, libertarians.
[00:03:07.654 --> 00:03:17.878]  There's another photo in Paul Watson's article confirmed by local news to be Bradley fighting vehicles rolling out to be refitted for homeland security.
[00:03:17.878 --> 00:03:25.401]  People saw them rolling through the town last night as things were burning and were cheering the National Guards here.
[00:03:25.401 --> 00:03:28.722]  Obama has sent them because they've been federalized.
[00:03:28.722 --> 00:03:31.984]  No, the governor didn't send them.
[00:03:31.984 --> 00:03:33.924]  The president didn't send them.
[00:03:33.924 --> 00:03:35.365]  The Bradley fighting vehicles
[00:03:37.097 --> 00:03:43.600]  Are being sent for Homeland Security and Northcom for the American people and gun owners.
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:04:02.589]  And Obama told the New York Times over the weekend, in an article published in the New York Times, he did the interview a week ago, and they're reportedly going to put video out later in the interview as well, but it's text right now, that the number one threat to America is conservatives and extremist ideology that is quote, taken over the GOP.
[00:04:04.465 --> 00:04:06.026]  Well, it is true.
[00:04:06.026 --> 00:04:19.012]  The libertarian, reality-based, survival movement is taking over the GOP because the GOP leadership has sold out to the globalists, and so we're kicking these people out.
[00:04:19.012 --> 00:04:20.632]  Not just Eric Cantor.
[00:04:20.632 --> 00:04:22.433]  The march is on.
[00:04:22.433 --> 00:04:23.514]  And so this is the threat.
[00:04:23.514 --> 00:04:26.095]  The Tea Party is the threat to the globalists.
[00:04:26.095 --> 00:04:28.516]  Not that it's perfect, but it is real opposition.
[00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:36.663]  Doesn't want to bankrupt the country, doesn't want to take the guns, doesn't want to open the borders, doesn't want to fund Al-Qaeda.
[00:04:36.663 --> 00:04:41.807]  And so, they are coming after the American people.
[00:04:41.807 --> 00:04:45.749]  That's a Breitbart article, it's not InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:56.856]  I'm glad that Breitbart is finally reporting on one of the New York Times reports that they're preparing for war with people that don't engage in burning down buildings.
[00:04:59.076 --> 00:05:01.558]  This is Scottish John for InfoWars.com.
[00:05:01.558 --> 00:05:08.262]  I know that most of you here in this commercial already know about the New World Order, eugenics, and all the other issues covered here at InfoWars.
[00:05:08.262 --> 00:05:11.044]  The question is, do your friends and family know?
[00:05:11.044 --> 00:05:12.985]  If not, then I want to know why.
[00:05:12.985 --> 00:05:15.287]  Oh, I know it's tough to talk about this with some people.
[00:05:15.287 --> 00:05:19.510]  They might call you names, or they just want to talk about sports, or soap operas.
[00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:20.932]  I say, so what?
[00:05:20.932 --> 00:05:23.135]  There's a battle going on out there right now.
[00:05:23.135 --> 00:05:26.520]  The ammunition is information, and the soldiers are you.
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.786]  It's time to transform your game from passive listener to active participant.
[00:05:30.786 --> 00:05:35.113]  We from Scotland have had our skin in this game for the greater part of the last thousand years.
[00:05:35.353 --> 00:05:36.614]  And I'm still fighting.
[00:05:36.614 --> 00:05:39.836]  If we don't all stand up right now, we're gonna lose everything.
[00:05:39.836 --> 00:05:41.658]  The Infowar is worldwide.
[00:05:41.658 --> 00:05:45.981]  Tell your friends about Infowars and let them know that Infowars doesn't print bull.
[00:05:45.981 --> 00:05:49.704]  It's real journalism and news backed up by documented fact.
[00:05:49.704 --> 00:05:56.949]  Step up and take your friends and family to Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv and PlanetInfowars.com.
[00:05:56.949 --> 00:05:58.411]  The truth will set them free.
[00:05:59.091 --> 00:06:06.257]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:06:06.257 --> 00:06:08.599]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:13.883]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:06:13.883 --> 00:06:19.047]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:06:19.047 --> 00:06:22.090]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:26.453]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:06:26.453 --> 00:06:30.776]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:06:30.776 --> 00:06:41.004]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:06:41.004 --> 00:06:43.526]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs
[00:06:43.706 --> 00:06:51.914]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[00:06:51.914 --> 00:06:55.878]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:07:00.012 --> 00:07:01.373]  In the near future.
[00:07:01.373 --> 00:07:05.857]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[00:07:05.857 --> 00:07:07.078]  Security alert.
[00:07:07.078 --> 00:07:09.100]  This is Homeland Security.
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.804]  Analysis, InfoWars, building independent media operation.
[00:07:12.804 --> 00:07:15.166]  Let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we
[00:07:15.606 --> 00:07:17.667]  We are the ones responsible.
[00:07:17.667 --> 00:07:18.707]  Prime Directive.
[00:07:18.707 --> 00:07:20.228]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[00:07:20.228 --> 00:07:23.110]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:26.351]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[00:07:26.351 --> 00:07:28.652]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[00:07:28.652 --> 00:07:30.173]  These people are assaulting us.
[00:07:30.173 --> 00:07:32.474]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[00:07:33.014 --> 00:07:34.955]  They are never going to stop.
[00:07:34.955 --> 00:07:38.816]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[00:07:38.816 --> 00:07:45.919]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[00:07:45.919 --> 00:07:50.221]  Intellectually, it's begun and you can feel it.
[00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:13.231]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:08:13.231 --> 00:08:25.233]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:25.233 --> 00:08:31.354]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this live Monday edition, the 11th day of August, 2014.
[00:08:36.218 --> 00:08:40.119]  And we will be here for the next three hours live.
[00:08:40.119 --> 00:08:59.085]  Pastor Chuck Baldwin, former presidential candidate for the Constitution Party, and a leading patriot out there exposing how our churches have been federalized, how our churches have been seized, will be joining us to talk about the Hitlerian doctrine.
[00:09:00.387 --> 00:09:10.150]  of Romans 13, and how the churches have been turned into engines of politically correct brainwashing.
[00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:13.031]  So he's going to be joining us in the second hour today.
[00:09:13.031 --> 00:09:27.455]  For 30 minutes, in the last 30 minutes of the third hour, New York TV host and syndicated radio host, Lionel, who was attacked along with myself and Matt Drudge last week, by Keith Oberman and a bunch of other individuals, for daring
[00:09:29.049 --> 00:09:32.493]  You know, to question establishment orthodoxy.
[00:09:32.493 --> 00:09:38.999]  He's going to be joining us to talk about a whole bunch of important news issues and more today.
[00:09:38.999 --> 00:09:41.842]  And we will have open phones as well.
[00:09:43.962 --> 00:09:58.590]  In fact, I want to take phone calls for first-time callers today to discuss Obama's bombing of ISIS and what's really behind that, to get into the escalations in Ukraine, to get into a stack of news of more political correctness that is
[00:10:00.086 --> 00:10:04.870]  Being deployed as an authoritarian blanket across the nation.
[00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:13.719]  Also IBM has developed a functioning computer chip with 1 million neurons that again functions like a human brain.
[00:10:13.719 --> 00:10:15.981]  That's out of the Daily Mail.
[00:10:15.981 --> 00:10:21.546]  That integrates in with a story out of the Charlotte CBS affiliate.
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:27.982]  Report, robots will take over more jobs than they create.
[00:10:27.982 --> 00:10:29.703]  Yes, that's the big issue.
[00:10:29.703 --> 00:10:31.744]  That's how that's being set up and implemented.
[00:10:31.744 --> 00:10:38.326]  We're going to talk about some of the technocracy at the bottom of the hour.
[00:10:38.326 --> 00:10:49.011]  We're also going to get into the big developments with the rioting in Ferguson that's tied into the Obama race baiting promotions via
[00:10:51.061 --> 00:11:04.932]  All the propaganda we've seen on MSNBC and CNN with Trayvon Martin, that is all coming up today here on this syndicated broadcast.
[00:11:04.932 --> 00:11:08.075]  I'll give the number out coming up at the start of the next segment.
[00:11:08.075 --> 00:11:13.739]  In fact, let me just move here in the stack from right to left today.
[00:11:14.952 --> 00:11:26.895]  And begin with what's happening with Obama's airstrikes that started last Thursday against IS, Islamic State, formerly ISIS, formerly Al-Qaeda.
[00:11:26.895 --> 00:11:29.515]  And there are some whoppers today.
[00:11:29.515 --> 00:11:34.356]  Obama says Iraq airstrike effort could be long-term.
[00:11:34.356 --> 00:11:41.078]  So the war never ended there, now it's back on for the foreseeable future.
[00:11:41.078 --> 00:11:42.718]  And again, what is behind that?
[00:11:44.386 --> 00:12:02.600]  IS was set up for the last four years, giving billions of dollars in Eastern Syria by Turkey, by Israel, by Saudi Arabia, by Qatar, by NATO, by France, by the British, and by the United States on record.
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:03.341]  You can just pull up
[00:12:04.622 --> 00:12:14.488]  Hundreds of articles in the New York Times and even in the Council on Foreign Relations admitting that 60-plus percent of the fighters were Islamic State.
[00:12:14.488 --> 00:12:24.995]  And then our media would be like, well, that's why we need to get behind the nice fighters that only blow up the churches and only cut off the men's heads and rape the women.
[00:12:24.995 --> 00:12:26.776]  They don't kill the babies.
[00:12:26.776 --> 00:12:30.619]  And then the Al-Qaeda people, they even behead the children.
[00:12:31.408 --> 00:12:37.353]  of the Christians and of the Sunnis, not the Shia.
[00:12:37.353 --> 00:12:40.456]  I mean the Shia, not the Sunnis.
[00:12:40.456 --> 00:12:45.019]  And so they just play on your incredible ignorance and the general public's ignorance.
[00:12:45.019 --> 00:12:58.771]  They think that the people that are uninformed just have no idea what's even going on and can't find the Middle East if the country's even had names on them.
[00:13:01.198 --> 00:13:05.201]  And so now people ask, well, why is Obama bombing IS?
[00:13:05.201 --> 00:13:07.282]  Because they don't completely control it.
[00:13:07.282 --> 00:13:11.785]  They just funded it, helped radicalize it, gave it basis.
[00:13:11.785 --> 00:13:22.393]  IS is now even attacking Jordan, which helped arm them and train them probably more than any other country when it came to physical basis.
[00:13:25.362 --> 00:13:34.444]  Our military was made to tolerate IS bases on the border in the last three plus years with Syria, with Iraq.
[00:13:34.444 --> 00:13:45.487]  Turkey has given artillery support and shelled the military of Syria that has been fighting them for three plus years.
[00:13:45.487 --> 00:13:49.748]  And that's why a bunch of military officers and the Marines, the Army, the Air Force,
[00:13:50.990 --> 00:14:03.682]  And the Navy all went public last year when we were going to bomb openly the Syrian capital and Syrian power plants and water treatment and military bases and airports to show that Al-Qaeda could take over.
[00:14:04.994 --> 00:14:06.435]  It was a big backlash.
[00:14:06.435 --> 00:14:10.397]  It stunned the globalists, completely confused them.
[00:14:10.397 --> 00:14:13.239]  Bilderberg was beside itself from our sources.
[00:14:13.239 --> 00:14:15.821]  It was one of the main topics, how to spin it.
[00:14:15.821 --> 00:14:20.364]  And they decided to spin it by rebranding as ISIS, then as IS.
[00:14:20.364 --> 00:14:23.986]  They'll probably rename it a couple more times.
[00:14:23.986 --> 00:14:27.088]  To then confuse everybody and sheep-dip Al-Qaeda.
[00:14:27.932 --> 00:14:32.856]  And then we pointed out they would then come into Iraq when they started attacking four months ago in Fallujah.
[00:14:32.856 --> 00:14:37.179]  Our military was not allowed to strike back when their convoys came in by the hundreds of vehicles per convoy.
[00:14:37.179 --> 00:14:39.601]  Then the artillery was moved in.
[00:14:39.601 --> 00:14:42.763]  They were allowed to set up their states so they can't be kicked out.
[00:14:42.763 --> 00:14:50.149]  But now they've got to be contained when they try to go into Shiite areas in the east and south and into Kurd areas in the north.
[00:14:51.826 --> 00:15:02.353]  And in a special report on this Friday that's up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com titled, Obama's bombing of IS is a hoax.
[00:15:02.353 --> 00:15:07.156]  And I want to retweet that at RealAlexJones right now so folks can send that on to your friends and family.
[00:15:07.156 --> 00:15:17.043]  It's a 15 minute video and it breaks down everything that's happening in that video with the documents, with the proof, even with the mainstream news articles.
[00:15:17.043 --> 00:15:19.064]  So that's what's happening currently on that front.
[00:15:19.064 --> 00:15:20.425]  Obama says Iraq
[00:15:21.969 --> 00:15:38.841]  Airstrike effort could be long-term and that's only to bomb them when they try to go into Kurdish areas to the north or when they try to go into south easterly areas in the east that are Shiite and Iranian controlled.
[00:15:38.841 --> 00:15:49.829]  This is the criminal breakup of Iraq and the areas mainly where the Christians lived in the traditionally
[00:15:51.202 --> 00:15:57.244]  Central areas and western areas will now be expunged, and the mass murder will continue.
[00:15:57.244 --> 00:16:11.728]  And you won't see any rioting by Christians, be they black or white or hispanic across the U.S., burning down grocery stores like we're seeing in Ferguson, Missouri, because hundreds of thousands of Christians have and will be now slaughtered.
[00:16:11.728 --> 00:16:12.989]  Have been and are going to be.
[00:16:14.616 --> 00:16:29.774]  Of course, what would you burn down to protest the fact that our government's arming people and protecting people to murder Christians and only now bombing them because they're killing Kurd minorities, about 10,000 of them, hiding up on a mountain, which I'm all for bombing ISIS, by the way.
[00:16:31.428 --> 00:16:36.389]  You notice I'm only for bombing people the globalists created and are protecting.
[00:16:36.389 --> 00:16:38.570]  I'm never for bombing any of these countries.
[00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:50.834]  I'm never for attacking Libya, never for attacking Syria, never for getting involved with trying to overthrow the Egyptian government and put Al-Qaeda basically in charge, the Muslim Brotherhood.
[00:16:50.834 --> 00:16:54.355]  See, the globalists are for the toppling of all those regimes.
[00:16:54.355 --> 00:16:55.475]  I was against it.
[00:16:55.475 --> 00:16:59.316]  Now, they didn't want to bomb ISIS when their convoys were pouring in four months ago.
[00:17:01.035 --> 00:17:03.097]  Because then they could have been taken out easily.
[00:17:03.097 --> 00:17:18.613]  Now that they're in place, you'll have a few bombings of some old broken artillery, uh, and, you know, to basically send the message, hey, don't come here in the backs of your Toyotas with your .50 calibers and your Stinger missiles, or we'll bomb you.
[00:17:18.613 --> 00:17:19.694]  See how sick that is?
[00:17:21.235 --> 00:17:23.397]  A message from ISIS to the U.S.
[00:17:23.397 --> 00:17:28.681]  Islamist militants tweet gruesome images of dead American soldiers and vow to blow up U.S.
[00:17:28.681 --> 00:17:35.205]  embassies as terrorist convoy is wiped out in second round of airstrikes.
[00:17:35.205 --> 00:17:40.970]  But only teaching them you don't get the curd oil, basically Europe's agreed to get that third.
[00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:49.026]  And then Saudi Arabia and others, they get the West, the Iranians get the East and part of the South.
[00:17:49.026 --> 00:17:54.490]  See, this is a deal to break the country up, and so ISIS is being told, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:17:54.490 --> 00:18:03.237]  You can kill all the Christians you want, and all the Muslim minorities you want, you just can't go into the Kurd areas, okay?
[00:18:03.237 --> 00:18:04.478]  Think about how sick that is.
[00:18:06.505 --> 00:18:13.614]  You're not going to hear a word at your glitterbug church, your big mega church, about this this week when you go to church.
[00:18:13.614 --> 00:18:18.961]  Clinton blames Islamic militants' rise on Obama, French news agency.
[00:18:18.961 --> 00:18:23.367]  Hillary Clinton came out and basically said she liked George Bush two weeks ago on CNN.
[00:18:25.919 --> 00:18:29.060]  Now she's saying she wouldn't have open borders like Obama's doing.
[00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:32.880]  Now she came out and said, well, you know, we don't need too much more gun control.
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.741]  Pure baloney.
[00:18:34.741 --> 00:18:36.661]  She runs Obama.
[00:18:36.661 --> 00:18:40.942]  Clintons run Obama on record.
[00:18:40.942 --> 00:18:54.145]  So this is pure mindless positioning for moron, yellow dog, Ku Klux Klan, Southern Democrats who want their welfare checks to go vote for Hillary.
[00:18:54.145 --> 00:18:55.445]  That's how dumb they think you are.
[00:18:57.128 --> 00:18:57.928]  Here's another one.
[00:18:57.928 --> 00:18:59.149]  Hillary Clinton.
[00:18:59.149 --> 00:19:03.592]  Failure to help Syrian rebels led to the rise of ISIS.
[00:19:03.592 --> 00:19:04.152]  That's right.
[00:19:04.152 --> 00:19:14.558]  Remember they said we need to have air bombing campaigns of the Syrian forces or Al-Qaeda will get a training base in Syria and take over the Middle East.
[00:19:14.558 --> 00:19:19.261]  While they were through the Turkish ambassador from Benghazi who was there that day.
[00:19:20.512 --> 00:19:27.870]  Giving the heavy weapons, the artillery, the Stinger missiles, the TOW missiles, the Chinese Red Arrows, all of it.
[00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:29.133]  Anything the CIA could buy.
[00:19:30.868 --> 00:19:33.689]  Hundreds of thousands of machine guns bought from the U.S.
[00:19:33.689 --> 00:19:35.330]  sent over there, just everything.
[00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:37.290]  Then they think you're so dumb now.
[00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:40.131]  Oh, we didn't topple Assad.
[00:19:40.131 --> 00:19:41.852]  That's why Al-Qaeda's doing this.
[00:19:41.852 --> 00:19:45.894]  Oh, I'm sure Al-Qaeda would have been, you know, not bad at all if they would have got serious.
[00:19:45.894 --> 00:19:47.934]  See, they need them to get a country.
[00:19:47.934 --> 00:19:56.758]  So they're making a new country for them to now terrorize everything, attack the U.S., hijack jets, blow up embassies, kill our military to keep the war going.
[00:19:56.758 --> 00:19:57.478]  See how that works?

[00:21:01.938 --> 00:21:09.383]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.

[00:21:58.547 --> 00:21:59.308]  Question.
[00:21:59.308 --> 00:22:04.091]  Could too many GMO foods and toxins be overloading your digestive and immune systems?
[00:22:04.091 --> 00:22:05.352]  Answer, yes.
[00:22:05.352 --> 00:22:11.597]  If you're searching for a powerful detox that's gentle enough to use every day, use Pro-EM-1 from Teriganics.

[00:22:58.121 --> 00:23:00.822]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.

[00:23:05.144 --> 00:23:06.524]  Silverlungs.com.

[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:31.184]  You've been hearing about the in-home freeze dryer from Harvest Ride for months now.
[00:23:31.184 --> 00:23:32.706]  Have you invested in yours yet?
[00:23:32.706 --> 00:23:35.288]  As you know, we live in a politically and economically troubled time.
[00:23:35.288 --> 00:23:38.011]  You should be preparing for an uncertain future today.
[00:23:38.752 --> 00:23:44.997]  Right now is the time to start freeze drying your own food so you can become self-reliant and less dependent upon others.
[00:23:44.997 --> 00:23:49.060]  To invest in your own home freeze dryer, go to HarvestRight.com.
[00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:50.781]  Hurry, supplies are limited.
[00:23:50.781 --> 00:23:53.644]  Again, that's a home freeze dryer from HarvestRight.com.
[00:23:53.644 --> 00:23:55.845]  And be sure to mention this ad to save $200 through the month of August.
[00:24:09.022 --> 00:24:15.905]  While you were sleeping, they came and took it all away, folks.
[00:24:15.905 --> 00:24:21.367]  And until we wake up, we're not gonna get any of it back.
[00:24:21.367 --> 00:24:25.769]  A servile population will be slaves.
[00:24:25.769 --> 00:24:31.651]  A cowardly population will be the property, the vassals of others.
[00:24:33.447 --> 00:24:39.148]  And in this tyranny that we live in, they will even steal our consciousness, our free will.
[00:24:39.148 --> 00:24:49.311]  So, Hillary Clinton says that Obama didn't do enough to hand Syria over to the rebels, who were mainly Al-Qaeda.
[00:24:49.311 --> 00:25:00.974]  And so, because he didn't give enough to Al-Qaeda, that's the reason now Al-Qaeda's changed its name and taken over much of Iraq, and is now running around wildly murdering everybody.
[00:25:02.768 --> 00:25:09.452]  I have photos here today of small children holding up people's heads that have been chopped off in Iraq.
[00:25:09.452 --> 00:25:20.300]  And again, this has all been part of a strategic plan to shut down any sovereign nation that is sustainable.
[00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:23.942]  The globalists want to do the very same stuff here, they just can't get away with it yet.
[00:25:23.942 --> 00:25:28.025]  Hillary Clinton, failure to help Syrian rebels led to rise of ISIS.
[00:25:29.045 --> 00:25:29.605]  That's right.
[00:25:29.605 --> 00:25:37.951]  Then they give all this twisted logic explaining it and people read the New York Times and think they're real smart or read the Atlantic and, oh, you read the New York Times?
[00:25:37.951 --> 00:25:40.573]  Oh, you're an intellectual.
[00:25:40.573 --> 00:25:45.497]  Laura Ingraham has come out and said Iraq is worse off now than under Saddam Hussein.
[00:25:45.497 --> 00:25:54.663]  Yeah, so why did you support the bipartisan Republicans and Democrats toppling Hussein in 1991 and then in
[00:26:00.546 --> 00:26:04.310]  99 with the Clintons bombing and then in 2003 and then his capture in 2007.
[00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:09.694]  On and on and on.
[00:26:09.694 --> 00:26:14.038]  She says after 11 years Iraq is worse off and that Obama's doing a terrible job.
[00:26:14.038 --> 00:26:16.159]  No he's not!
[00:26:16.159 --> 00:26:18.521]  But I appreciate you telling part of the truth, Laura.
[00:26:18.521 --> 00:26:19.182]  You're a smart lady.
[00:26:21.616 --> 00:26:22.497]  She's been around a long time.
[00:26:22.497 --> 00:26:24.458]  Wasn't she in the Reagan administration?
[00:26:24.458 --> 00:26:26.440]  She's getting ready to run for office.
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:27.961]  I'd like to be able to support somebody like her.
[00:26:27.961 --> 00:26:33.986]  She's good on guns and taxes and things, but really bad on warmongering.
[00:26:33.986 --> 00:26:35.967]  Did any of these wars turn out good for anybody?
[00:26:35.967 --> 00:26:44.814]  Our troops, our country, we're in debt, and we got a dead million Iraqis plus, and that's on our name until we repent of it.
[00:26:47.708 --> 00:26:56.757]  The Iraqis were some of the most pro-Western people in the whole Middle East, folks, until we screwed them over for more than two decades.
[00:26:56.757 --> 00:27:07.528]  And both political parties and the political class are behind it, and now they're breaking the country in three parts again, giving Saudi Arabia a third, Iran a third, and basically the EU a third.
[00:27:07.528 --> 00:27:09.150]  And we all paid for it.
[00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:10.892]  That's what a joke this country's become!
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:18.405]  Oh look at this headline out of the Washington Post so intellectuals can read it and learn about things.
[00:27:18.405 --> 00:27:25.132]  Fighters abandoning Al-Qaeda affiliations to join Islamic State.
[00:27:25.132 --> 00:27:25.532]  U.S.
[00:27:25.532 --> 00:27:28.756]  officials say, you mean I.S.
[00:27:28.756 --> 00:27:33.660]  and ISIS are like an Al-Qaeda new name?
[00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:36.884]  Oh my, oh that is very intellectual.
[00:27:39.175 --> 00:27:50.885]  We told you day one when all this started, really about eight months ago when they started taking Fallujah, but four months ago when they dubbed themselves ISIS, that it was Al-Qaeda being globalist funded and directed.
[00:27:50.885 --> 00:27:54.968]  Again, think of how sensationally evil that is.
[00:27:54.968 --> 00:27:56.710]  And the public is so confused.
[00:27:58.049 --> 00:28:06.091]  That I have so-called intellectuals stop me on the street or I talk to their talk show host and they're like, yeah, I really think we ought to be bombing ISIS, Alex.
[00:28:06.091 --> 00:28:07.612]  Ah, yes, they're really bad.
[00:28:07.612 --> 00:28:09.112]  Why are you criticizing Obama?
[00:28:09.112 --> 00:28:10.273]  He's finally doing something.
[00:28:10.273 --> 00:28:12.933]  I thought you didn't like those people.
[00:28:12.933 --> 00:28:17.115]  Meanwhile, I've been telling people about it before it even started.
[00:28:17.115 --> 00:28:18.775]  Yes, I want to bomb ISIS.
[00:28:18.775 --> 00:28:20.496]  I want them all dead.
[00:28:20.496 --> 00:28:22.236]  Every stinking last one of them.
[00:28:22.236 --> 00:28:26.898]  They are a bunch of murdering, psychopathic, child-killing scum.
[00:28:26.898 --> 00:28:27.738]  But who's more evil?
[00:28:30.677 --> 00:28:37.885]  The crazy Al-Qaeda, ISIS people, where you don't get to join their club unless you're totally out of your mind?
[00:28:37.885 --> 00:28:40.208]  So the most radical becomes the leader?
[00:28:40.208 --> 00:28:45.955]  Or the globalists that have been protecting and funding them and giving them weapons since 1979, with Zbigniew Brzezinski?
[00:28:50.219 --> 00:29:13.373]  The next administration of Ronald Reagan, and then George Herbert Walker Bush, and then Clinton, Clinton, and then Bush, Bush, and now Obama, Obama, that's what's evil, is the corporate globalist interest that are creating full-spectrum dominance where they dump out a whole hive of wasp, or hornets,
[00:29:17.975 --> 00:29:24.341]  Into your house, and then they show up, knock on the door, five minutes later, when you've run out of your house.
[00:29:24.341 --> 00:29:26.242]  Or they come in your backyard, you want to go back in your house?
[00:29:26.242 --> 00:29:27.784]  I'm a hornet killer.
[00:29:27.784 --> 00:29:30.086]  You know, pay me and I'll go take the hornets out.
[00:29:30.086 --> 00:29:36.211]  So he goes in, gets some of the hornets, kills a few, puts them back in another hive, goes to the next neighbor, sticks them in there.
[00:29:36.211 --> 00:29:40.054]  I mean, it's the same deal, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:40.054 --> 00:29:45.079]  Over and over again, and we're too stupid to figure it out.
[00:29:46.898 --> 00:29:48.560]  Come back and get into the riots.
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:49.280]  We're on the march.
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:50.341]  We're taking place in Missouri.
[00:29:50.341 --> 00:29:51.202]  The umpires on the run.
[00:29:51.202 --> 00:29:52.504]  Your phone calls.
[00:29:52.504 --> 00:29:55.026]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:55.026 --> 00:29:56.267]  Stay with us ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:56.267 --> 00:29:56.688]  Stay with us.
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:01.781]  This is Alex Jones for InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:30:01.781 --> 00:30:04.602]  The latest in preparedness is now here.
[00:30:04.602 --> 00:30:10.785]  An electrically stabilized colloidal silver solution that can be added to both your home cabinet and preparedness pack alike.
[00:30:10.785 --> 00:30:15.868]  Concentrated to 30 parts per million in what has been dubbed the survival silver solution.
[00:30:15.868 --> 00:30:20.770]  The new InfoWars Life Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver is the answer for you and your family.
[00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:25.272]  And it's entirely free of toxic artificial additives that are loaded into many products.
[00:30:25.572 --> 00:30:34.156]  The InfoWarsLife Silver Bullet Silver is so powerful that it is concentrated into a 2-ounce bottle and is not recommended for extended continual use.
[00:30:34.156 --> 00:30:36.317]  This is not a low-grade formula.
[00:30:36.317 --> 00:30:47.502]  We are working with one of the top laboratory manufacturers in the United States to bring you the best form of colloidal silver using electrical processes within a base of deionized water.
[00:30:47.502 --> 00:30:54.906]  For your preparedness storage or your home kitchen, purchase your bottle of InfoWarsLife.com Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver today.
[00:30:55.426 --> 00:31:07.510]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset, where we are proud of our 100% grown and sewn American made jeans.
[00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:15.393]  Whether you're out for dinner, working on the farm, or on the road, Diamond Gusset Jeans offers a full spectrum of style and sizes for any occasion.

[00:31:26.281 --> 00:31:29.225]  In Liberty, David Hall, Diamond Gusset Jeans Company.
[00:31:29.781 --> 00:31:33.424]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:31:33.424 --> 00:31:37.707]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:31:37.707 --> 00:31:39.488]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:31:39.488 --> 00:31:47.354]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:31:47.354 --> 00:31:48.495]  But for how long?
[00:31:48.495 --> 00:31:55.140]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:57.962]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:31:59.665 --> 00:32:05.827]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:32:05.827 --> 00:32:10.389]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[00:32:10.389 --> 00:32:14.951]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[00:32:15.351 --> 00:32:18.272]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[00:32:18.272 --> 00:32:23.714]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[00:32:23.714 --> 00:32:31.116]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[00:32:31.116 --> 00:32:35.237]  And the results that I personally have had have been life changing.
[00:32:35.237 --> 00:32:40.019]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:32:40.359 --> 00:32:48.809]  This is innovating and the best part is it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[00:32:48.809 --> 00:32:53.255]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[00:32:53.255 --> 00:32:58.722]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:13.400]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:16.341]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:33:16.341 --> 00:33:27.083]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:33:27.083 --> 00:33:29.583]  I'm gonna try to get him on tomorrow or the next day.
[00:33:29.583 --> 00:33:33.944]  James O'Keefe has struck again of the Veritas Project.
[00:33:33.944 --> 00:33:37.105]  Stories up on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:33:37.105 --> 00:33:38.225]  He was able
[00:33:39.338 --> 00:33:48.905]  To go across the border and then dress up like Osama Bin Laden in camouflage with a turban on his head, swim across the Rio Grande.
[00:33:48.905 --> 00:33:50.006]  What a genius idea.
[00:33:50.006 --> 00:33:51.447]  Why didn't we think of that?
[00:33:51.447 --> 00:33:53.169]  Just to illustrate how wide open it is.
[00:33:54.096 --> 00:34:09.684]  I think we should have, like, three of our guys go down in one of those big expensive costumes as, like, a Chinese dragon, and then show that, go across, dress up like Hitler and Bozo the Clown, just to illustrate how absolutely ridiculous it is.
[00:34:09.684 --> 00:34:14.426]  He's almost dressed like Justin Bieber in diaper pants, if you see the video.
[00:34:14.426 --> 00:34:19.149]  And we're also posting that to InfoWars.com, where it is now posted.
[00:34:20.169 --> 00:34:21.610]  Up on Infowars.com.
[00:34:21.610 --> 00:34:24.512]  There's a lot of other crazy news out there.
[00:34:24.512 --> 00:34:28.114]  Like famous race car drivers with shock video.
[00:34:28.114 --> 00:34:32.897]  Running over and killing another driver.
[00:34:32.897 --> 00:34:35.819]  No criminal charges imminent.
[00:34:35.819 --> 00:34:38.981]  Stewart threatened to run over a driver two years ago following wreck.
[00:34:41.866 --> 00:34:52.149]  And, you know, when it's pretty obvious, you notice they don't arrest people, but then when an ESPN host admits he hit his girlfriend once when she hit him years ago, he gets suspended.
[00:34:52.149 --> 00:35:01.011]  See, oh, Nerf gun in your backyard, you're suspended from school, even though there's no law or regulation saying they can do that.
[00:35:01.011 --> 00:35:02.672]  Or, oh, uh,
[00:35:04.628 --> 00:35:09.272]  You, you know, had a leaking sprinkler, so $700 fines.
[00:35:09.272 --> 00:35:14.536]  But, oh, you run somebody over in front of everybody, and you're this big race car driver icon.
[00:35:14.536 --> 00:35:17.679]  Well, nothing happens, see?
[00:35:17.679 --> 00:35:23.563]  It's all about stuff that's for the general public or people that haven't actually done something wrong.
[00:35:23.563 --> 00:35:26.606]  That's what this globalism, political correctness is all about.
[00:35:27.645 --> 00:35:37.669]  All over the country, superintendents are freaking out over, quote, athenine, we don't have enough teachers, and now we have to hire food police.
[00:35:37.669 --> 00:35:51.435]  That's out of the newspaper, EganNews.org, where in Atlanta, Georgia, they're not allowed to have any type of cake or ice cream or bake sales now under federal rules.
[00:35:51.435 --> 00:35:55.876]  Since when did the feds tell Atlanta, Georgia they couldn't have bake sales?
[00:35:55.876 --> 00:35:57.217]  Since when do private schools?
[00:35:58.956 --> 00:36:03.039]  My children were going to a Christian private school, one of the best in Austin, two years ago.
[00:36:03.039 --> 00:36:14.887]  Very nice people, but they had days twice a year where it was food and videos shown of Michelle Obama telling you what to eat.
[00:36:14.887 --> 00:36:16.188]  Or they didn't get accreditation.
[00:36:18.206 --> 00:36:20.788]  This is the brainwashing that we're under in this country.
[00:36:20.788 --> 00:36:22.209]  That's just some of the news that's coming up.
[00:36:22.209 --> 00:36:23.750]  I want to take your phone calls.
[00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:25.050]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:36:25.050 --> 00:36:25.170]  800-259-9231.
[00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:25.631]  First-time callers, 800-259-9231.
[00:36:25.631 --> 00:36:27.412]  What do you make of the bombing of ISIS?
[00:36:27.412 --> 00:36:31.314]  I'm all for bombing ISIS so they don't take over the Kurdish areas of northern Iraq, one-third of the nation.
[00:36:46.075 --> 00:37:11.755]  But they were allowed to come in and were not bombed when they were taking over major cities in the West and major oil fields in the last six, eight months, calling themselves ISIS the last four, and allowed to even advance up to Baghdad, because they've now been given that area as a permanent state to then carve out half of Syria is the new country, Islamic State.
[00:37:12.734 --> 00:37:14.436]  And our government helped him do that.
[00:37:14.436 --> 00:37:25.987]  That was the admitted Pentagon plan under Brzezinski and others, Wesley Clark talked about it five years ago, to take over those countries, eight of them, and then break them all in two to four pieces.
[00:37:25.987 --> 00:37:28.109]  Two, three, or four pieces.
[00:37:28.749 --> 00:37:32.152]  And again, it's to show destabilization.
[00:37:32.152 --> 00:37:34.514]  They're not breaking Iraq in three pieces.
[00:37:34.514 --> 00:37:38.837]  I've seen CNN go, well, we'll probably partition the country in three pieces down the road.
[00:37:38.837 --> 00:37:40.779]  Iraq was never supposed to be a country anyways.
[00:37:40.779 --> 00:37:44.461]  And all the pseudo-intellectuals go, yeah, so I guess it's okay.
[00:37:44.461 --> 00:37:46.883]  No, it's not okay.
[00:37:46.883 --> 00:37:49.605]  You get rid of the stabilizing central government.
[00:37:49.605 --> 00:37:51.147]  It brings people electricity and water.
[00:37:53.123 --> 00:38:22.089]  After 20 plus years of siege, and war, and over a million dead Iraqis conservatively, and this mass war crime the West has committed against them, Saudi Arabia attacks us reportedly on 9-11, so we attack Iraq on and on and on and on, because Iraq's the key country in the middle of Jordan, and Syria, and Lebanon, and Israel, all bordering it, and Iran
[00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:33.628]  And Russia, and Turkey, it's right in the middle, so the globalists want to control it, so they can build proxy armies in it to just absolutely destabilize everything.
[00:38:35.287 --> 00:38:37.628]  I mean, it makes me want to vomit!
[00:38:37.628 --> 00:38:38.828]  And I want to get off that subject.
[00:38:38.828 --> 00:38:42.289]  I've got like 12 stacks, 14 stacks of news over here.
[00:38:42.289 --> 00:38:43.489]  I don't know, I covered one stack.
[00:38:43.489 --> 00:38:45.329]  I've got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, document cam shot.
[00:38:45.329 --> 00:38:45.989]  I just said 12.
[00:38:45.989 --> 00:38:46.390]  I always say 12.
[00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:47.470]  But people think I exaggerate.
[00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:48.130]  I normally underestimate.
[00:38:57.489 --> 00:39:00.372]  So I had a bunch more stacks than I said, okay?
[00:39:00.372 --> 00:39:01.473]  Just stacks everywhere.
[00:39:01.473 --> 00:39:03.275]  Look at all these stacks.
[00:39:03.275 --> 00:39:05.096]  Just do a wide shot.
[00:39:05.096 --> 00:39:10.321]  There's too many stacks.
[00:39:10.321 --> 00:39:15.887]  I mean, there are just stack upon stack upon stack upon stack upon stack.
[00:39:15.887 --> 00:39:19.631]  All more insane than the last.
[00:39:19.631 --> 00:39:20.872]  And I haven't even gotten to your calls yet.
[00:39:23.724 --> 00:39:24.805]  800-259-9231.
[00:39:24.805 --> 00:39:30.847]  And the phone system's crashed, guys, so if I'm gonna get to those calls, I need to reboot that.
[00:39:30.847 --> 00:39:33.428]  Thank you.
[00:39:33.428 --> 00:39:35.769]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:35.769 --> 00:39:46.053]  Now, doing the best I can here, I'm going to get into this other news, just mention it, and then go to your phone calls.
[00:39:46.053 --> 00:39:46.093]  800-259-9231.
[00:39:50.690 --> 00:40:00.757]  Now, continuing here, I decided, right as I went on today, to do a end-of-summer, back-to-brainwashing special.
[00:40:00.757 --> 00:40:16.588]  Because it is time to go back to the government training centers, time to go back to the government-run, state-run churches, time to tune back into the state-run media, time to have all the traffic intensify, time to have all the crime build back up and the rest of it.
[00:40:16.588 --> 00:40:19.050]  Everything that comes with the back-to-school time
[00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:28.806]  And all the vaccines and all the lies about how it's the law to take vaccines to go to school and how we'll all die from pandemics.
[00:40:28.806 --> 00:40:42.536]  If we don't take the vaccines, it's time to have another winter with all the flesh-eating bacteria and MRSA and all the drug-resistant bacterias killing people and time for the flu to come back and time for the big dark winter and the rest of it.
[00:40:42.536 --> 00:40:45.678]  So, I thought we would celebrate this great tragedy
[00:40:47.045 --> 00:40:54.346]  With 10% off everything at InfoWarsStore.com, or when you call the toll-free number.
[00:40:54.346 --> 00:40:59.667]  It could be a book, it could be a film, it could be stacks of InfoWars magazine at cost.
[00:40:59.667 --> 00:41:06.748]  It could be the designer Molon Labe belt buckles that are almost sold out.
[00:41:06.748 --> 00:41:09.449]  We made a thousand of these.
[00:41:09.449 --> 00:41:13.810]  They're numbered in the nickel ones, and then there's the bronze.
[00:41:13.810 --> 00:41:15.430]  Molon Labe, come and take your belt buckles.
[00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:18.582]  And we got 500 of each.
[00:41:18.582 --> 00:41:23.548]  We actually made 500 of the nickel and only 250 that haven't numbered up in the bronze.
[00:41:23.548 --> 00:41:25.670]  So the bronze has sold out.
[00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:27.572]  250 more coming, that'll sell out.
[00:41:27.572 --> 00:41:29.294]  The nickel, I think there's like 10 of them left.
[00:41:31.331 --> 00:41:32.772]  And when it's gone, it's gone.
[00:41:32.772 --> 00:41:33.893]  They're numbered on the back.
[00:41:33.893 --> 00:41:36.456]  The others are getting smelted right now.
[00:41:36.456 --> 00:41:38.077]  So again, we have those limited edition.
[00:41:38.077 --> 00:41:39.839]  That's 10% off those.
[00:41:39.839 --> 00:41:44.042]  Normally, a designer belt buckle made in the USA like this would cost $100.
[00:41:44.042 --> 00:41:46.304]  They're $45 normally.
[00:41:46.304 --> 00:41:48.266]  10% off, it's even less.
[00:41:48.266 --> 00:41:50.908]  10% off at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:41:50.908 --> 00:41:54.512]  That's 10% off the entire InfoWars Life line of products.
[00:41:54.952 --> 00:42:00.516]  That's even the survival shield and fluoride shield already discounted 30 plus percent.
[00:42:00.516 --> 00:42:05.279]  That's an additional 10% off already on everything that's for sale.
[00:42:05.279 --> 00:42:08.821]  We're not allowed to go more than 10% off on ProPure, the water filters.
[00:42:08.821 --> 00:42:10.562]  We already have the lowest price anywhere.
[00:42:10.562 --> 00:42:12.944]  So that's normally 10% anyways.
[00:42:12.944 --> 00:42:14.185]  So just 10%.
[00:42:14.185 --> 00:42:16.086]  Now, what is the code?
[00:42:16.086 --> 00:42:17.186]  Put 10 in at checkout.
[00:42:19.721 --> 00:42:19.781]  Yes.
[00:42:34.821 --> 00:42:39.003]  Just everything that is on InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:42:39.003 --> 00:42:45.106]  InfoWarsLife.com is just a subdirectory of InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:42:45.106 --> 00:42:50.949]  So everything is there, 10% off the already discounted Made in America apparel at MadeIn1776.com.
[00:42:54.147 --> 00:42:58.870]  Chuck Baldwin's Romans 13 book, The True Meaning of Submission, second edition.
[00:42:58.870 --> 00:43:00.572]  He's coming on in the next hour.
[00:43:00.572 --> 00:43:04.074]  That is discounted 10% off the already lowest price.
[00:43:04.074 --> 00:43:04.955]  Everything.
[00:43:04.955 --> 00:43:06.156]  And we're going to run this special...
[00:43:07.429 --> 00:43:09.871]  Until next Monday, and that's it.
[00:43:09.871 --> 00:43:13.235]  Promo code 1-0.
[00:43:13.235 --> 00:43:15.137]  As in Marilyn Monroe in her prime.
[00:43:15.137 --> 00:43:16.017]  1-0.
[00:43:16.017 --> 00:43:20.302]  1-0, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:43:20.302 --> 00:43:29.490]  And you get 10% off across the board, and that also gets you a deal, high-quality products, and funding, the very tip of the spear in information warfare.
[00:43:30.231 --> 00:43:38.718]  And I also know it's expensive sending people back to the trauma-based mind control, trendy training, political correctness, brainwashing facilities.
[00:43:38.718 --> 00:43:41.620]  So again, we want to just give everybody 10% off.
[00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:44.263]  Promo code 1-0.
[00:43:44.263 --> 00:43:46.625]  And I'll also send a mass email out today.

[00:43:51.324 --> 00:43:56.045]  with the word on that 10% off running it until next week.

[00:44:07.849 --> 00:44:09.389]  And that's all she wrote.
[00:44:09.389 --> 00:44:10.449]  I will quit plugging that.
[00:44:10.449 --> 00:44:13.110]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:44:13.110 --> 00:44:20.272]  Please be sure and support our local AM and FM affiliates as well by supporting their local sponsors or becoming sponsors.
[00:44:23.322 --> 00:44:24.242]  Here's another headline.
[00:44:24.242 --> 00:44:26.863]  Crucified by the Caliphate monsters.
[00:44:26.863 --> 00:44:30.644]  Remember Glenn Beck used to warn folks about the Caliphate and MSNBC made fun of him?
[00:44:30.644 --> 00:44:33.044]  We would warn folks about the West funding it as well.
[00:44:33.044 --> 00:44:34.125]  We would get made fun of.
[00:44:34.125 --> 00:44:34.585]  Oh!
[00:44:34.585 --> 00:44:37.145]  Calls itself the Caliphate.
[00:44:37.145 --> 00:44:42.847]  Iraq descends into apocalypse as Islamic State fanatics seize towns and tell terrified
[00:44:44.264 --> 00:44:48.787]  Minority Muslims, by noon today, we will kill all of you.
[00:44:48.787 --> 00:44:50.809]  What nice people.
[00:44:50.809 --> 00:45:03.798]  And then Obama composes the Savior after being right in the middle of the West, creating and funding these people, creating this nuclear conglomerate, and then he can now grandstand and do... I saw the footage.
[00:45:03.798 --> 00:45:07.601]  They didn't show crisp, up-close, infrared
[00:45:09.144 --> 00:45:09.644]  Gun footage.
[00:45:09.644 --> 00:45:14.826]  They showed blown out where you couldn't tell what was happening and it didn't even look like artillery they were bombing.
[00:45:14.826 --> 00:45:22.488]  I mean, there's thousands of pieces of artillery they've captured from those Iraqi bases and they show two pieces of artillery being blown up.
[00:45:22.488 --> 00:45:25.148]  Or they show a couple trucks being blown up.
[00:45:25.148 --> 00:45:28.149]  I mean, I don't even think they're bombing any of these guys.
[00:45:28.149 --> 00:45:35.271]  They're letting them get strong, take over Iraq, a third of Iraq, build up their command base and go smashing back into Assad
[00:45:36.738 --> 00:45:40.399]  And then Hillary says, oh yes, we've got to bomb Assad to stop them.
[00:45:40.399 --> 00:45:42.280]  That's how dumb they think we are.
[00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:45.421]  I mean, it is just total twilight zone.
[00:45:45.421 --> 00:45:46.462]  So I'm done talking about that.
[00:45:46.462 --> 00:45:50.583]  I want to go to your phone calls.
[00:45:50.583 --> 00:45:52.384]  But first, this story is so huge.
[00:45:52.384 --> 00:45:55.125]  I'm going to talk about this with Chuck Baldwin.
[00:45:55.125 --> 00:46:01.307]  Remember six years ago, we got the secret documents from state police officer in Missouri.
[00:46:03.809 --> 00:46:11.914]  And then we were able to get another document a week later from a federal marshal.
[00:46:11.914 --> 00:46:19.639]  And to show how bad the surveillance is in this country, they found out who the state police guy was, and he got in trouble.
[00:46:19.639 --> 00:46:21.700]  It later blew over.
[00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:25.483]  And he since got promoted, so that's a message about doing the right thing.
[00:46:25.483 --> 00:46:28.685]  He got in trouble at first, but admired by people later.
[00:46:30.218 --> 00:46:33.159]  In my experience, I didn't do all this because I knew I'd win.
[00:46:33.159 --> 00:46:35.220]  I did it because my instinct was fight tyranny.
[00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:42.343]  But I always get heat when I do the right thing from the world, from the media, from the system at first.
[00:46:42.343 --> 00:46:50.747]  But as soon as you go through that fire, when you do it for the right reasons, you generally get rewarded on the other side, folks.
[00:46:50.747 --> 00:46:55.309]  When you give in to evil, you end up getting rewarded up front, but hurt later.
[00:46:57.637 --> 00:46:58.718]  Isn't that what the Bible says?
[00:46:58.718 --> 00:47:01.840]  Do evil, you get rewarded up front, get hurt later.
[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:06.264]  Do the right thing, get hurt up front, get rewarded later.
[00:47:06.264 --> 00:47:09.667]  That's just weird logic, but that's how it works.
[00:47:09.667 --> 00:47:13.450]  But the reason I mention that is it shows the surveillance, folks.
[00:47:13.450 --> 00:47:20.696]  They went and found out where he had faxed it to me and went and sent people in, FBI,
[00:47:24.212 --> 00:47:26.713]  Two weeks later, they called him in in front of us.
[00:47:26.713 --> 00:47:28.655]  He was a supervisor.
[00:47:28.655 --> 00:47:31.957]  He was mid-level.
[00:47:31.957 --> 00:47:36.419]  And then here came the FBI.
[00:47:36.419 --> 00:47:42.683]  Saying, why did you send that to Alex Jones?
[00:47:42.683 --> 00:47:45.985]  But with the federal marshal, he knew how to send it to us.
[00:47:45.985 --> 00:47:48.686]  Snail mail.
[00:47:48.686 --> 00:47:50.728]  Wearing gloves in case they were coming to grab it.
[00:47:51.698 --> 00:47:58.444]  Snail mail, wearing gloves, and you just put a different address, one that's not yours, on the envelope.
[00:47:58.444 --> 00:48:01.367]  It's like Matt Drudge said, you gotta meet in parking garages.
[00:48:01.367 --> 00:48:07.712]  And back when NSA people and high-level telecom engineers would meet me, they would never tell me they were coming.
[00:48:07.712 --> 00:48:08.873]  They wouldn't stop me.
[00:48:08.873 --> 00:48:15.880]  They would find out where I lived, or they would be waiting in the parking lot, or they would come to a public event I was at.
[00:48:16.656 --> 00:48:21.177]  And then sit in the parking lot waiting and then give it to me.
[00:48:21.177 --> 00:48:25.738]  And they'd be wearing a hat on top of it, folks, because of face scanning cameras.
[00:48:25.738 --> 00:48:28.699]  And they would say, wait a few weeks until you report on this.
[00:48:28.699 --> 00:48:34.480]  And then they would drive off again in their brand new Suburban or their brand new Mercedes.
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:40.541]  These were all senior people that would give me all the intel before anybody else had it.
[00:48:40.541 --> 00:48:43.582]  And I didn't mean to run off into a rabbit trail
[00:48:44.915 --> 00:48:49.657]  It's just when I see a headline like this, I have flashbacks to the fact that we broke all this.
[00:48:49.657 --> 00:48:55.979]  Remember eight years ago, the preacher that gave us the secret clergy response team documents?
[00:48:55.979 --> 00:49:02.001]  He faxed that from one of those mailbox places.
[00:49:02.001 --> 00:49:02.881]  Mailbox, etc.
[00:49:02.881 --> 00:49:05.102]  type places.
[00:49:05.102 --> 00:49:11.084]  And we posted the documents where they had hired most of the preachers in the country to work for the FBI or the CIA.
[00:49:12.363 --> 00:49:18.328]  And even giving them brainwashing manuals, the big megachurches, name it and claim it, how to condition and manipulate the public.
[00:49:18.328 --> 00:49:21.570]  But even small churches have it, and to give them faith-based initiative money.
[00:49:21.570 --> 00:49:26.234]  It started under Bush, but accelerated under Obama.
[00:49:26.234 --> 00:49:32.359]  And they came in a week later to the hospital, where he was an administrator.
[00:49:32.359 --> 00:49:38.864]  He had a church on the side, pretty good-sized church, and said, we're going to get you fired from the hospital.
[00:49:40.458 --> 00:49:51.267]  And they got him fired from the hospital for separately giving us those documents.
[00:49:51.267 --> 00:49:57.332]  I mean, what an evil government, ladies and gentlemen, for letting you know what Obama now says publicly.
[00:49:57.332 --> 00:50:05.219]  Obama says extremist ideology that's taken over the GOP, balkanization, the media, has blocked my agenda.
[00:50:06.004 --> 00:50:24.350]  Yeah, what did Clinton say in the White House documents that came out a few months ago from his library, that they were able to get through FOIA requests, the Western Journalism Center, Joseph Farah, that we can't let the public ever have their own media, we gotta discredit any media that isn't controlled by us, calling them conspiracy terrorists.
[00:50:25.526 --> 00:50:32.473]  And he goes on to say that radicals have taken over the Republican Party and that they're basically extremists and that they're the biggest threat to the country.
[00:50:32.473 --> 00:50:34.395]  We'll see what Homeland Security says.
[00:50:34.395 --> 00:50:40.841]  They're preparing with the tanks, with the armor, with the police for war against the people that want to save this nation.
[00:50:43.749 --> 00:50:45.170]  You understand that?
[00:50:45.170 --> 00:50:49.313]  And they're going to blow stuff up and blame it on us just as sure as the sun came up.
[00:50:49.313 --> 00:50:53.296]  We're trying to stop them by exposing their game plan, folks.
[00:50:53.296 --> 00:50:54.117]  This isn't a joke.
[00:50:54.117 --> 00:50:55.057]  This isn't a game.
[00:50:55.057 --> 00:50:57.039]  This is really happening.
[00:50:57.039 --> 00:50:58.280]  We'll be right back with your phone calls.
[00:50:59.474 --> 00:51:02.297]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:51:02.297 --> 00:51:07.421]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:51:07.421 --> 00:51:15.548]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:51:15.548 --> 00:51:20.073]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:51:20.073 --> 00:51:23.876]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:51:24.036 --> 00:51:29.980]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:33.142]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:51:33.142 --> 00:51:38.526]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[00:51:38.526 --> 00:51:46.532]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.

[00:52:00.239 --> 00:52:02.520]  Mike Stenerson from Midas Resources.
[00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:05.842]  At no time in history have precious metals been more important.
[00:52:05.842 --> 00:52:08.583]  Certainly not in my 22 years in the industry.
[00:52:08.583 --> 00:52:12.545]  The dollar's lost over 90% of its value in the last 60 years.
[00:52:12.545 --> 00:52:16.307]  No fiat currency has ever survived the government printing presses.
[00:52:16.307 --> 00:52:17.708]  Ours is not immune.
[00:52:17.708 --> 00:52:19.368]  The time is now to be proactive.
[00:52:19.368 --> 00:52:19.929]  1-800-686-2237 extension 116.
[00:52:24.671 --> 00:52:27.393]  Anything tied to the dollar is at risk.
[00:52:27.393 --> 00:52:32.997]  CDs, annuities, 401Ks, IRAs, stocks, bonds, you name it, so decide.
[00:52:32.997 --> 00:52:36.319]  Do you want to leave a legacy of wealth or debt for your family?
[00:52:36.319 --> 00:52:37.640]  The choice is yours.
[00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:38.740]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237 extension 116.
[00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:39.861]  That's 1-800-686-2237 extension 116.
[00:52:39.861 --> 00:52:40.862]  Be proactive, not reactive.
[00:52:40.862 --> 00:52:41.042]  Call 1-800-686-2237
[00:52:54.935 --> 00:52:55.480]  Extension 116.
[00:52:58.666 --> 00:53:01.688]  Do you ever feel like you live in an alternate universe?
[00:53:01.688 --> 00:53:05.830]  As the stock market hits new highs, the middle class are dying.
[00:53:05.830 --> 00:53:08.851]  Manipulated financial markets and economic figures.
[00:53:08.851 --> 00:53:10.492]  Chaos on our border.
[00:53:10.492 --> 00:53:12.993]  China and Russia bypassing the dollar.
[00:53:12.993 --> 00:53:14.934]  Life is getting ready to change.
[00:53:14.934 --> 00:53:17.976]  You need to prepare to thrive in the new economy.
[00:53:17.976 --> 00:53:21.177]  Go to babyboomerbackupplan.com or call 888-507-8789.

[00:53:46.695 --> 00:53:48.577]  Helping thousands prepare since 2005.
[00:53:48.577 --> 00:53:49.457]  GoBerkey.com.
[00:54:12.632 --> 00:54:23.259]  I hurt myself today to see if I still feel.
[00:54:23.259 --> 00:54:28.682]  I focus on the pain.
[00:54:28.682 --> 00:54:37.848]  The only thing... If our government will give 15,000 Stinger missiles to Al-Qaeda and blow up a sub-embassy and kill everybody to cover it up,
[00:54:39.298 --> 00:54:52.280]  You think they'll stage a terror attack in America to blame it on their political opposition, when the Republican and Democratic leadership have been doubling down money against the Tea Party the last two years running, trying to shut them down?
[00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:58.401]  You think they might do something to frame us, when they have a history of doing it before?
[00:54:58.401 --> 00:55:02.462]  I'm risking my life, ladies and gentlemen, I just want you to know that.
[00:55:02.462 --> 00:55:04.223]  To tell you these truths.
[00:55:04.223 --> 00:55:06.523]  My family's been threatened, I've been threatened over and over again.
[00:55:08.382 --> 00:55:09.763]  And I'm not saying I'm a hero.
[00:55:09.763 --> 00:55:13.505]  I don't want to see these people win and totally destroy our country.
[00:55:13.505 --> 00:55:20.529]  Our borders are wide open while IS has hundreds of thousands of fighters in the Middle East total.
[00:55:20.529 --> 00:55:24.011]  They had at least 200,000 affiliated with this group in Syria.
[00:55:25.111 --> 00:55:28.315]  That have been in and out of there, and they can now walk right across our border.
[00:55:28.315 --> 00:55:30.117]  They're heavily financed.
[00:55:30.117 --> 00:55:39.707]  And when the terror attacks come, they will use the attacks to take our liberties by more armored vehicles, more helicopters, that will never even be used against ISIS.
[00:55:39.707 --> 00:55:45.193]  They'll be used against gun owners, veterans, Christians and conservatives, and libertarians.
[00:55:45.894 --> 00:55:46.955]  I don't mean to go off on a jag.
[00:55:46.955 --> 00:55:48.576]  I want to go to your phone calls.
[00:55:48.576 --> 00:55:50.438]  I haven't even gotten into the riots in Missouri.
[00:55:50.438 --> 00:55:52.940]  We'll get into that with Chuck Bolden as well.
[00:55:52.940 --> 00:55:55.002]  Incredible political correctness.
[00:55:55.002 --> 00:55:56.663]  I said I'd get into the AI computers.
[00:55:56.663 --> 00:55:59.205]  I'll do that at one o'clock at the start of the third hour.
[00:55:59.205 --> 00:56:00.186]  It's so important.
[00:56:00.186 --> 00:56:01.287]  Remind me guys to do that.
[00:56:02.281 --> 00:56:08.126]  There's some very important news about what the robot metrics are going to do replacing humans.
[00:56:08.126 --> 00:56:11.769]  That's been the plan all along, but it's now in a major government study.
[00:56:11.769 --> 00:56:13.171]  So all that and more coming up.
[00:56:13.171 --> 00:56:17.795]  Let's go to your phone calls, Jesse, Chris, Lisa, Fred, Weldon, and others.
[00:56:17.795 --> 00:56:19.336]  Let's go to Jesse in Texas.
[00:56:19.336 --> 00:56:19.937]  You're on the air.
[00:56:19.937 --> 00:56:22.739]  Thanks for calling.
[00:56:22.739 --> 00:56:23.780]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:24.541]  Good brother, go ahead.
[00:56:25.694 --> 00:56:27.355]  Thank you for having me on air, man.
[00:56:27.355 --> 00:56:37.359]  Something that I wanted to bring up and bring attention to was I was looking last night on Twitter and the hashtag, a message from ISIS to U.S.
[00:56:37.359 --> 00:56:37.779]  I don't know.
[00:56:37.779 --> 00:56:39.240]  It's something that's been freaking me out.
[00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:44.422]  I mean, I spent like a good 30 minutes looking at the tweets from ISIS.
[00:56:44.422 --> 00:56:52.345]  And these guys are like, you know, I don't know if these are hoaxes or not, but they're already taking pictures apparently within the U.S.
[00:56:52.345 --> 00:56:54.066]  and saying we are everywhere.
[00:56:54.066 --> 00:56:54.606]  We're here.
[00:56:55.746 --> 00:57:05.604]  Oh no, this was a major radical Islamic revolution funded by the globalists, and I meant to get on the phone with Paul this weekend and say what you're saying, and I don't want to be a drama queen either.
[00:57:06.618 --> 00:57:15.121]  But one reason I'm getting really mad is there are well-known websites that have been attacking me for years that are openly promoting ISIS and saying they're part of it.
[00:57:15.121 --> 00:57:20.262]  And so we even have ISIS scripts, people affiliated with it, threatening us right now.
[00:57:20.262 --> 00:57:22.063]  And I'm really getting sick of it, man.
[00:57:22.063 --> 00:57:24.163]  Our government lets a bunch of these people in.
[00:57:24.163 --> 00:57:25.284]  They're running all over us.
[00:57:26.064 --> 00:57:35.629]  And then they use the threat of their people to then create a police state to point it at Ron Paul, and Alex Jones, and Matt Drudge, and the free press.
[00:57:35.629 --> 00:57:37.350]  It makes me want to vomit.
[00:57:37.350 --> 00:57:39.171]  In fact, let me get Paul on the phone right now.
[00:57:39.171 --> 00:57:43.733]  I meant to do that because I saw the tweets that our government allows ISIS.
[00:57:43.733 --> 00:57:44.953]  Remember a month ago?
[00:57:44.953 --> 00:57:46.554]  Oh, we need to let ISIS keep tweeting.
[00:57:46.554 --> 00:57:48.055]  We track them that way.
[00:57:48.055 --> 00:57:49.776]  Give me a break, folks.
[00:57:51.407 --> 00:57:55.850]  Again, if you were Obama and the globalists, how do you take over America?
[00:57:55.850 --> 00:58:01.313]  You fund a terrorist group, let them attack us, and then take our freedom when you run the group.
[00:58:01.313 --> 00:58:02.254]  How sick is that?
[00:58:02.254 --> 00:58:03.134]  Does that make you angry?
[00:58:03.134 --> 00:58:05.436]  Hell yes, it does.
[00:58:05.436 --> 00:58:09.458]  I mean, these guys are even tweeting, like, you know, 9-11 Part 2 coming soon.
[00:58:09.458 --> 00:58:11.179]  Like, that's not funny, man.
[00:58:11.179 --> 00:58:15.341]  Like, you know, anything could... I've had enough of it!
[00:58:15.341 --> 00:58:17.242]  I tell you, it makes me mad.
[00:58:17.242 --> 00:58:19.504]  Makes me want to really... I'm just getting sick of it.
[00:58:21.741 --> 00:58:24.363]  And of course the public has no idea our government is funding it.
[00:58:24.363 --> 00:58:26.204]  Because it's not our government.
[00:58:26.204 --> 00:58:29.225]  It's globalist offshore banks that want to bring the country down.
[00:58:29.225 --> 00:58:31.167]  That's why the border's wide open.
[00:58:31.167 --> 00:58:38.711]  And Obama can activate his operatives through Al Sharpton and others and have the inner city folks burn everything down at the same time.
[00:58:38.711 --> 00:58:39.492]  This could be it.
[00:58:39.492 --> 00:58:40.672]  I'm telling you folks.
[00:58:40.672 --> 00:58:42.753]  They are lining everything up.
[00:58:42.753 --> 00:58:46.095]  Operation Chaos to bring this country down.
[00:58:46.095 --> 00:58:47.176]  Anybody can see it.
[00:58:47.176 --> 00:58:48.437]  It's asymmetrical warfare.
[00:58:49.181 --> 00:58:56.345]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:58:56.345 --> 00:58:58.707]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:58:58.707 --> 00:59:03.970]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:59:03.970 --> 00:59:09.153]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:59:09.153 --> 00:59:12.175]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:59:12.475 --> 00:59:16.538]  Well over a thousand types of molds and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:59:16.538 --> 00:59:20.861]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:59:20.861 --> 00:59:31.089]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:59:31.089 --> 00:59:41.877]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[00:59:41.997 --> 00:59:52.313]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLive.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:59:52.313 --> 00:59:54.716]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:54.716 --> 00:59:57.460]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.370 --> 01:00:10.213]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.213 --> 01:00:11.814]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.814 --> 01:00:13.335]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.335 --> 01:00:17.538]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.538 --> 01:00:21.620]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.134 --> 01:00:39.543]  You know, I've talked about how things are going to get more and more Twilight Zone, totally open borders, government funding IS-ISIS, then bombing them when they get out of areas they're not supposed to enter.
[01:00:39.543 --> 01:00:42.365]  It's kind of like painting by colors.
[01:00:42.365 --> 01:00:47.328]  They tell Al-Qaeda where they're supposed to attack, change their names, the public doesn't figure it out.
[01:00:47.328 --> 01:00:49.490]  Oh, you got outside the lines?
[01:00:49.490 --> 01:00:50.311]  Slap your wrist!
[01:00:52.728 --> 01:00:53.528]  It's just insane.
[01:00:53.528 --> 01:00:56.029]  Look at the headlines on InfoWars.com.
[01:00:56.029 --> 01:00:58.110]  I haven't even gotten to the riots yet.
[01:00:58.110 --> 01:01:00.471]  We've got 15 after.
[01:01:00.471 --> 01:01:02.952]  We've got Pastor Chuck Baldwin joining us.
[01:01:02.952 --> 01:01:04.052]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[01:01:04.052 --> 01:01:06.493]  Lisa in California, you're on the air.
[01:01:06.493 --> 01:01:06.853]  Go ahead.
[01:01:08.115 --> 01:01:08.656]  Hi Alex.
[01:01:08.656 --> 01:01:09.657]  Happy Monday.
[01:01:09.657 --> 01:01:10.678]  Happy full moon.
[01:01:10.678 --> 01:01:12.700]  I think we are seeing the effects of it.
[01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:14.202]  What a crazy weekend.
[01:01:14.202 --> 01:01:16.544]  It was really hard to watch my town burn.
[01:01:16.544 --> 01:01:19.287]  I'm from Ferguson, that area.
[01:01:19.287 --> 01:01:19.968]  Grew up there.
[01:01:19.968 --> 01:01:23.151]  And you know, they've been race baiting that area probably for 20 years.
[01:01:24.833 --> 01:01:33.198]  Started back in high school, and we had a really nice new high school, and they started busing in all the inner-city kids to our high school.
[01:01:33.198 --> 01:01:34.719]  Caused all kinds of problems.
[01:01:34.719 --> 01:01:35.980]  They didn't want to be there.
[01:01:35.980 --> 01:01:36.420]  We didn't.
[01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:42.904]  I mean, we welcomed them, but, you know, then there was vandalism and all kinds of chaos.
[01:01:42.904 --> 01:01:46.606]  Bathrooms torn up, the stall doors missing.
[01:01:46.606 --> 01:01:50.648]  You know, I couldn't walk down the hall in a skirt without getting it flipped up.
[01:01:50.648 --> 01:01:52.209]  It was just horrible.
[01:01:52.689 --> 01:02:03.199]  And I think I'm seeing that sort of played out now, and it reminds me of the open borders where, you know, we're bringing in people who aren't going to appreciate it here.
[01:02:03.199 --> 01:02:14.189]  The natives or whatever we are aren't going to appreciate them, and it just sets up this whole horrible, chaotic situation, and it really makes me sad to see.
[01:02:14.189 --> 01:02:18.633]  And then, you know, I guess you saw the militarized vehicles coming down the street, and it's
[01:02:19.313 --> 01:02:20.074]  Off the chain.
[01:02:20.074 --> 01:02:21.577]  Absolutely horrible.
[01:02:21.577 --> 01:02:24.561]  I don't know how to fix it, but I think it's a really long time coming.
[01:02:26.636 --> 01:02:27.677]  No, I hear you.
[01:02:27.677 --> 01:02:34.281]  And of course, those tanks, those are Bradley fighting vehicles, were being sent to Homeland Security base.
[01:02:34.281 --> 01:02:37.723]  People saw the tanks on the train rolling through and thought, oh, they're here to save us.
[01:02:37.723 --> 01:02:39.004]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:02:39.004 --> 01:02:44.948]  Those are for the Tea Party, not for people burning down buildings and looting the shops.
[01:02:44.948 --> 01:02:54.134]  So, and now Trayvon Martin's lawyer is going to take over and go race bait the entire deal after a black youth was shot.
[01:02:54.134 --> 01:02:54.634]  And again,
[01:02:57.992 --> 01:03:04.575]  Who even needs the military when all these militarized police showed up with the armored vehicles and the rest of it?
[01:03:04.575 --> 01:03:08.717]  But then basically stood there while the people looted and rioted.
[01:03:08.717 --> 01:03:13.859]  And you know, you also notice they always loot corporate stores because nobody's going to protect them.
[01:03:13.859 --> 01:03:23.084]  Just like what happened in the LA riots, the Korean shops that were privately owned didn't get looted because people went there with shotguns, started shooting people.
[01:03:23.084 --> 01:03:25.345]  And see, if somebody was trying to loot my operation,
[01:03:26.952 --> 01:03:34.852]  I would simply wait until they knock the door down, and then we'll be waiting with shotguns and .223s and .308s on the other side.
[01:03:34.852 --> 01:03:35.834]  We're going to defend our property.
[01:03:36.772 --> 01:03:37.712]  And so that's the answer.
[01:03:37.712 --> 01:03:44.515]  I mean, if people were looting my business, the minute they crossed the threshold, they would get justice there on the spot.
[01:03:44.515 --> 01:03:50.178]  But it is just unspeakable, the type of stuff that's going on.
[01:03:50.178 --> 01:03:54.920]  And then people wonder why businesses end up leaving the neighborhoods.
[01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:57.961]  But this has all been sold as acceptable.
[01:03:59.309 --> 01:04:01.451]  And the entire country is a time bomb.
[01:04:01.451 --> 01:04:12.624]  Can you imagine what will happen, Lisa, if the welfare checks, when the country starts breaking down and the dollar goes belly up, stop showing up or stop having the same purchasing value?
[01:04:14.122 --> 01:04:14.923]  Oh, it's awful.
[01:04:14.923 --> 01:04:22.288]  And I think that, you know, somebody said if these people had a job to go to this morning, they may not have been out all night last night tearing up the town.
[01:04:22.288 --> 01:04:24.349]  You know, it's really sad.
[01:04:24.349 --> 01:04:26.951]  It's just awful to see.
[01:04:26.951 --> 01:04:28.633]  And I don't know how to fix it.
[01:04:28.633 --> 01:04:29.813]  People have to stand together.
[01:04:29.813 --> 01:04:35.878]  And somebody else said, you know, oh my gosh, when this kid's funeral happens, you know, what's going to happen to the town?
[01:04:35.878 --> 01:04:37.839]  Is everyone going to erupt and go crazy then?
[01:04:37.839 --> 01:04:39.140]  I don't know.
[01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:40.061]  Where does it end?
[01:04:40.894 --> 01:04:41.635]  So that's that.
[01:04:41.635 --> 01:04:45.159]  And I also want to bring up another point about the vaccines that you touched on.
[01:04:45.159 --> 01:04:50.266]  I'm a vet tech, and I have to tell you that the same thing happens to the animals that happens to the children.
[01:04:50.266 --> 01:04:54.872]  Hold on, I want to hear as a vet tech what happens to animals when you give them the vaccines.
[01:04:54.872 --> 01:04:58.176]  That's why vets have gone from giving them every year to about every three, because it kills the dogs.
[01:05:00.285 --> 01:05:02.567]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Group.
[01:05:02.567 --> 01:05:10.011]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[01:05:10.011 --> 01:05:20.819]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[01:05:20.819 --> 01:05:30.065]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[01:05:30.785 --> 01:05:34.867]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[01:05:34.867 --> 01:05:38.609]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[01:05:38.609 --> 01:05:40.670]  Experience the new formula.
[01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:43.251]  Experience the ancient purity.
[01:05:43.251 --> 01:05:44.592]  Shield your family.
[01:05:44.592 --> 01:05:46.413]  Survival Shield X2.

[01:05:58.672 --> 01:06:00.895]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[01:06:00.895 --> 01:06:08.925]  Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:06:08.925 --> 01:06:16.114]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[01:06:16.474 --> 01:06:21.098]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago, and I must say, that is some good stuff.
[01:06:21.098 --> 01:06:31.727]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[01:06:31.727 --> 01:06:38.212]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[01:06:38.212 --> 01:06:40.774]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[01:06:40.774 --> 01:06:44.417]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and get the day started.
[01:06:44.577 --> 01:06:46.540]  It's not just the super male vitality.
[01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:50.705]  All the products in InfoWarsLife.com are simply amazing.

[01:06:58.703 --> 01:07:02.525]  City of Austin tap water versus filtered City of Austin tap water.
[01:07:02.525 --> 01:07:03.766]  I didn't, I taste dirt in it.
[01:07:03.766 --> 01:07:05.107]  God knows what's in there.
[01:07:05.107 --> 01:07:09.329]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[01:07:09.329 --> 01:07:15.093]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered for the Crowe Pure G2.0 filtration system.
[01:07:15.253 --> 01:07:16.313]  That one is better.
[01:07:16.313 --> 01:07:17.554]  Tastes like nothing.
[01:07:17.554 --> 01:07:18.954]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like.
[01:07:18.954 --> 01:07:19.635]  It's good water.
[01:07:19.635 --> 01:07:25.597]  Most tap water contains added substances, like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others.
[01:07:25.597 --> 01:07:32.840]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lowered IQ, and even cancer.
[01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:35.541]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're drinking tap water.
[01:07:35.541 --> 01:07:43.464]  The ProPure® G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh-tasting, deliciously clean water.
[01:07:43.804 --> 01:07:45.225]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[01:07:45.225 --> 01:07:45.825]  Good water.
[01:07:45.825 --> 01:07:46.426]  Refreshing?
[01:07:46.426 --> 01:07:47.046]  It's good!

[01:08:02.215 --> 01:08:08.839]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.839 --> 01:08:11.821]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:18.595 --> 01:08:29.525]  Pastor Chuck Baldwin is going to be joining us here in about 6-7 minutes for the Balance of the Hour to talk about an initiative to try to take our country back.
[01:08:29.525 --> 01:08:36.691]  He'll also discuss the current state of the world and where he sees things going.
[01:08:36.691 --> 01:08:38.053]  And then at the start of the next hour,
[01:08:40.456 --> 01:08:42.838]  I will get into the technocracy.
[01:08:42.838 --> 01:09:03.656]  IBM develops a computer chip with one million neurons that functions like a human brain and that dovetails with a new report out by the Pew Research Project and a major university with connections to DARPA that robots will take over jobs and displace humans.
[01:09:04.858 --> 01:09:11.762]  Well, that's because the architecture of the new political, financial, economic structure is being built to end humans as we know it.
[01:09:11.762 --> 01:09:17.245]  That's on record from MIT, Stanford, Bill Joy, Google.
[01:09:17.245 --> 01:09:19.186]  I mean, the course has been set.
[01:09:19.186 --> 01:09:21.387]  That's how I know what's coming.
[01:09:21.387 --> 01:09:32.413]  When we have victories and hold it off, people say, oh, some of it's happening, but not all of it, as we try to hold the gate against this, as we try to build a future for humans.
[01:09:33.806 --> 01:09:39.550]  Not a eugenics, technocracy-based system.
[01:09:39.550 --> 01:09:45.135]  The unwashed masses just scream, begging to be destroyed.
[01:09:45.135 --> 01:09:50.819]  Give us our NASCAR, give us our NFL, give us our political correctness, our MTV.
[01:09:50.819 --> 01:09:54.201]  Give us Barabas!
[01:09:54.201 --> 01:09:57.604]  Give us our vaccines, give us our New World Order.
[01:09:57.604 --> 01:09:58.745]  Give it to us, we want it!
[01:10:02.796 --> 01:10:09.419]  I'm going to go to Weldon, and Fred, and Chris, and then Dale later, but I want to finish up with Lisa.
[01:10:09.419 --> 01:10:18.262]  Lisa said that, have you just joined us, I held her over, that she was from Ferguson, we're going to break that down as well today, the rioting, the looting, the rest of it, and things to come.
[01:10:18.262 --> 01:10:20.463]  Stories are up on InfoWars.com.
[01:10:20.463 --> 01:10:28.807]  But she said, hey, I'm a vet tech, since it's back to school, and we've got all the vaccines and things happening, and she said that, have you just joined us, that
[01:10:30.373 --> 01:10:34.496]  Vaccines are the same thing to animals they do to the kids.
[01:10:34.496 --> 01:10:40.700]  Well see I worked for a small animal vet for two years from the time I was about 13 to 15.
[01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:48.004]  Then I got a car and I was sent for a year to live on the ranch because I was getting a lot of fights and stuff.
[01:10:48.004 --> 01:10:56.110]  I was just taken out of school almost for a whole year and a summer and I worked for a large animal vet who I worked for in some summers before but I worked for him straight through and
[01:10:57.285 --> 01:11:01.647]  He would tell people, well they recommend shots every year, but I think it messes them up.
[01:11:01.647 --> 01:11:06.129]  We see all sorts of problems when we vaccinate dogs and cats every year.
[01:11:06.129 --> 01:11:07.110]  I know it's recommended.
[01:11:07.110 --> 01:11:12.532]  Well, since then it's changed where it's every three years or so.
[01:11:12.532 --> 01:11:15.794]  Because the vets themselves had a backlash and you want...
[01:11:16.733 --> 01:11:27.078]  Ulcers, you want eczema on your cats and dogs, you want them to have health problems, you want them to get really bad allergies, you want them to get epilepsy.
[01:11:27.078 --> 01:11:33.661]  I haven't heard what she's going to say yet, but she says she's a vet tech, and I'm going to have a recap.
[01:11:33.661 --> 01:11:35.862]  I know vaccines are bad, folks.
[01:11:35.862 --> 01:11:40.084]  I know the four years running, every year, in August into September.
[01:11:41.613 --> 01:11:49.118]  It causes whooping cough outbreaks in California and other states when they give the MMR and other vaccines.
[01:11:49.118 --> 01:11:51.460]  And the whooping cough vaccine.
[01:11:51.460 --> 01:11:54.202]  And it comes out in the newsletter, the vaccine does it.
[01:11:54.202 --> 01:11:57.604]  I know what the hepatitis shots do in babies.
[01:11:57.604 --> 01:11:59.725]  I know medical doctors refuse to take them.
[01:11:59.725 --> 01:12:02.907]  I know, okay, because my dad's an oral surgeon.
[01:12:02.907 --> 01:12:04.889]  I know a lot of medical doctors.
[01:12:04.889 --> 01:12:06.370]  So, I'm not medically ignorant.
[01:12:08.735 --> 01:12:13.422]  See, Obama said that people that are anti-establishment read only what we want to read.
[01:12:13.422 --> 01:12:14.944]  Bull, I read everything.
[01:12:14.944 --> 01:12:16.486]  I'm not in some echo chamber.
[01:12:16.486 --> 01:12:19.411]  It's you, the authoritarians, that are.
[01:12:19.411 --> 01:12:19.871]  I know!
[01:12:19.871 --> 01:12:21.273]  Let me tell you something.
[01:12:21.273 --> 01:12:23.357]  I've cut myself out ranching before.
[01:12:24.488 --> 01:12:26.770]  And had stuff that might have tetanus in it.
[01:12:26.770 --> 01:12:29.812]  Because around horse manure, that's where it grows.
[01:12:29.812 --> 01:12:31.934]  And I haven't gone and gotten a tetanus shot.
[01:12:31.934 --> 01:12:35.697]  I've had a puncture wound and I've stuck a knife in there and had that sucker bleed.
[01:12:35.697 --> 01:12:39.240]  And if the tetanus shots weren't filled with other stuff, I'd go get one.
[01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:45.125]  But that's one of their favorite vaccines to add other hormones to, to manipulate male and female genetics.
[01:12:45.125 --> 01:12:47.327]  And they've been caught doing it.
[01:12:47.327 --> 01:12:48.628]  In secret tests.
[01:12:48.628 --> 01:12:50.790]  In Africa and India and the US.
[01:12:50.790 --> 01:12:52.331]  I'm not taking a tetanus shot.
[01:12:55.174 --> 01:12:56.575]  Even though it risks my life!
[01:12:56.575 --> 01:12:57.955]  I want to take that shot!
[01:12:57.955 --> 01:12:59.076]  I want good medicine!
[01:12:59.076 --> 01:13:04.458]  I don't want to be screwed with by a government jacking stuff into the vaccines!
[01:13:04.458 --> 01:13:06.318]  You go, well why is it hurting the dogs and cats too?
[01:13:06.318 --> 01:13:08.059]  Because there's no oversight of vaccines.
[01:13:08.059 --> 01:13:09.420]  They all have immunity.
[01:13:09.420 --> 01:13:12.301]  They cook them in big giant tanks.
[01:13:12.301 --> 01:13:15.962]  At the big vaccine manufacturing facilities up in Michigan and Lansing.
[01:13:15.962 --> 01:13:18.783]  That's where they make the vaccine they spray on meat.
[01:13:18.783 --> 01:13:20.744]  That's a live virus that eats bacteria.
[01:13:22.432 --> 01:13:24.173]  Then it's a wonder we're not all dead yet.
[01:13:24.173 --> 01:13:25.915]  You know what else they cook in those tanks?
[01:13:25.915 --> 01:13:29.358]  They use the same tanks that they make vaccines in other batches.
[01:13:29.358 --> 01:13:32.901]  They then reset the tanks and make other vaccines in them.
[01:13:32.901 --> 01:13:35.963]  They... It's devilish.
[01:13:35.963 --> 01:13:37.385]  It's demonic, folks.
[01:13:37.385 --> 01:13:39.927]  It is beyond.
[01:13:39.927 --> 01:13:43.530]  Just them tailoring stuff in the vaccines to hurt people.
[01:13:43.530 --> 01:13:47.253]  They just do whatever they want.
[01:13:47.253 --> 01:13:50.636]  Like it's a random gambling or something just to see how we mutate.
[01:13:51.926 --> 01:13:54.146]  I'm sorry I'm ranting, I get so angry about it.
[01:13:54.146 --> 01:14:00.048]  Thinking about all the kids right now that are getting shot up with dozens of vaccines and having epileptic seizures.
[01:14:00.048 --> 01:14:04.429]  They'll usually have a thousand kids getting vaccinated, a big city vaccination campaign.
[01:14:04.429 --> 01:14:08.610]  Oh, come get your free vaccines or get arrested.
[01:14:08.610 --> 01:14:11.490]  There's no law, you don't get arrested, it's all just hoaxes.
[01:14:11.490 --> 01:14:14.871]  They'll have dozens and dozens of kids that have epileptic seizures on the spot.
[01:14:16.158 --> 01:14:18.300]  No, they just had a bad reaction.
[01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:19.361]  No big deal.
[01:14:19.361 --> 01:14:21.563]  Imagine babies being shot up with that.
[01:14:21.563 --> 01:14:23.424]  Sorry Lisa, I'm ranting and we're going to our guests.
[01:14:23.424 --> 01:14:24.665]  I'm back to your calls.
[01:14:24.665 --> 01:14:26.247]  What did you want to tell us about the vaccines?
[01:14:27.307 --> 01:14:30.029]  Well, I love listening to you.
[01:14:30.029 --> 01:14:33.151]  You know, the yearly vaccines haven't been phased out.
[01:14:33.151 --> 01:14:41.277]  They did go to three years, but then there was a big pushback against them, and they said, no, we have to leave it up to your veterinarian.
[01:14:41.277 --> 01:14:45.920]  So, many people get that card in the mail every year, and they think, oh gosh, I've got to go get Buffy her shot.
[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:47.622]  You know, I'm a good owner.
[01:14:47.622 --> 01:14:50.323]  Well, then you're going to get a tumor at the injection site.
[01:14:50.323 --> 01:14:51.564]  You are going to get epilepsy.
[01:14:51.564 --> 01:14:52.585]  You will have allergies.
[01:14:52.585 --> 01:14:53.686]  You'll have bad ears.
[01:14:53.686 --> 01:14:55.127]  You'll have just
[01:14:55.507 --> 01:14:58.391]  A bunch of different problems, but there is a way to push back.
[01:14:58.391 --> 01:15:00.514]  You always talk about, what can we do to fight back?
[01:15:00.514 --> 01:15:05.901]  There is a tighter test that you can ask for instead of the yearly vaccine.
[01:15:05.901 --> 01:15:07.563]  I work for the biggest stars in Hollywood.
[01:15:07.563 --> 01:15:08.685]  Actually, I'm an L.A.A.
[01:15:08.685 --> 01:15:12.650]  now, and do you think they get their animals yearly shots?
[01:15:12.650 --> 01:15:12.870]  No.
[01:15:13.491 --> 01:15:17.014]  And most of them don't vaccinate their kids either, by the way.
[01:15:17.014 --> 01:15:29.883]  But you can go in, get a titer test, measure the immunity level in your pet, and they have found, the people that I've worked for now for 12 years, and I'm talking about, you know, like Justin Hoffman, Elizabeth Taylor, big, big, big stars.
[01:15:30.307 --> 01:15:37.451]  We have found that the immunity lasts up to nine, ten years, and these animals never needed a booster shot.
[01:15:37.451 --> 01:15:38.752]  They knew that the whole time.
[01:15:38.752 --> 01:15:44.996]  That's what Jess Adkins, top of his class, Texas A&M, stills a vet to this day.
[01:15:44.996 --> 01:15:46.196]  That's what he said.
[01:15:46.196 --> 01:15:48.458]  He said, look, Alex, this stuff lasts five to ten years.
[01:15:48.458 --> 01:15:49.638]  It's pure bull.
[01:15:49.638 --> 01:15:53.721]  The vaccine makers lobbied to get regulations in to make more money.
[01:15:54.641 --> 01:15:58.666]  And he would tell people, you know, don't get your shot every year for your dog.
[01:15:58.666 --> 01:15:59.567]  Because he saw it.
[01:15:59.567 --> 01:16:01.789]  And again, exactly the same thing.
[01:16:01.789 --> 01:16:10.879]  Epilepsy, tumor at the injection site, bad ears, diarrhea, irritable gut in the animals.
[01:16:10.879 --> 01:16:14.083]  Sometimes do the dogs have convulsions right there in your shop.
[01:16:15.447 --> 01:16:16.607]  Well, they can't.
[01:16:16.607 --> 01:16:19.828]  You know, the worst part is with the puppies and the kittens.
[01:16:19.828 --> 01:16:22.468]  I have a friend who works at Maine Society.
[01:16:22.468 --> 01:16:27.249]  They vaccinated, you know, you get 25 doses in a batch.
[01:16:27.249 --> 01:16:29.170]  They vaccinated all the cats in the shelter.
[01:16:29.170 --> 01:16:30.170]  She came to work the next day.
[01:16:30.170 --> 01:16:31.010]  They were all dead.
[01:16:31.010 --> 01:16:32.530]  And do you know what the person said?
[01:16:32.530 --> 01:16:37.831]  The vet in charge said, oh, guess we must have gotten a bad batch.
[01:16:37.831 --> 01:16:39.032]  I guess.
[01:16:39.032 --> 01:16:42.913]  You know, I don't know what your goal was, but yeah, it was a bad batch.
[01:16:42.913 --> 01:16:44.933]  Yeah, I mean, I'm no rocket scientist, but
[01:16:46.050 --> 01:16:51.072]  Every medical doctor I know goes, oh yeah, no, this does have cancer viruses.
[01:16:51.072 --> 01:16:52.673]  It does make you have epilepsy.
[01:16:52.673 --> 01:16:54.754]  It does cause brain damage.
[01:16:54.754 --> 01:16:58.276]  I ran into the head state guy.
[01:16:58.276 --> 01:17:01.377]  Oh, it had to be six, eight months ago on the hike and bike trail.
[01:17:01.377 --> 01:17:02.398]  And I looked him up.
[01:17:02.398 --> 01:17:03.038]  He told me his name.
[01:17:03.038 --> 01:17:03.858]  I looked him up.
[01:17:03.858 --> 01:17:05.239]  He said, just don't say my name.
[01:17:05.239 --> 01:17:06.600]  He was the head guy in the state.
[01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:10.781]  I won't say over what, but involved in vaccination.
[01:17:10.781 --> 01:17:11.702]  And it was him and his wife.
[01:17:13.164 --> 01:17:14.146]  Listen, we really like your show.
[01:17:14.146 --> 01:17:15.068]  We read your magazine.
[01:17:15.068 --> 01:17:15.730]  We're going to get a break.
[01:17:15.730 --> 01:17:17.333]  I'm back with Chuck Baldwin.
[01:17:17.333 --> 01:17:19.257]  This is such an important subject.
[01:17:19.257 --> 01:17:19.998]  He looked right at me.
[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:24.042]  And he said, but the end justifies the means.
[01:17:24.042 --> 01:17:33.390]  Statistically, there's less diseases and things because we do this, but we do cover up that it's hurting people because it'll make folks not get them.
[01:17:33.390 --> 01:17:35.672]  And I said, actually, I've seen the statistics.
[01:17:35.672 --> 01:17:42.338]  Hygiene and running water and better food by the 20s in the West made the diseases go down.
[01:17:42.338 --> 01:17:47.723]  Vaccines come in in the 40s and disease goes back up, just not as high as the level, the pre-20s level.
[01:17:48.427 --> 01:17:52.308]  And he goes, yeah, I've read that too, but you know what?
[01:17:52.308 --> 01:17:54.829]  It's just gotta be done.
[01:17:54.829 --> 01:17:57.950]  And I go, it's gotta be done because it's your job.
[01:17:57.950 --> 01:18:01.671]  And he just said, hey man, I gotta go.
[01:18:01.671 --> 01:18:05.952]  Do not tell people my name.
[01:18:05.952 --> 01:18:10.313]  And I went and looked the guy up, and sure enough, he was just insane.
[01:18:10.313 --> 01:18:13.814]  He works at the State Health Department right here in Austin.
[01:18:13.814 --> 01:18:15.755]  And I mean, look, look, look, I'm just telling the public.
[01:18:16.721 --> 01:18:17.722]  They have these hoaxes.
[01:18:17.722 --> 01:18:18.842]  I appreciate your call, ma'am.
[01:18:18.842 --> 01:18:19.243]  Incredible.
[01:18:19.243 --> 01:18:24.186]  You ought to do a YouTube disguising your name or whatever and, you know, warn people.
[01:18:24.186 --> 01:18:25.887]  We ought to put her on hold if she's not gone.
[01:18:25.887 --> 01:18:28.669]  She's gone and get her on as a whistleblower.
[01:18:28.669 --> 01:18:30.230]  People listen when you call it a whistleblower.
[01:18:30.230 --> 01:18:31.471]  I mean, she's not really a whistleblower.
[01:18:31.471 --> 01:18:38.156]  She's just telling her testimony, but people listen when you say it's a whistleblower because they act like warning people is illegal nowadays, so I guess it is a whistleblower.
[01:18:39.574 --> 01:18:43.557]  But they sit there and fear monger and tell you it's the law.
[01:18:43.557 --> 01:18:45.778]  You'll be arrested if you don't vaccinate your kids.
[01:18:45.778 --> 01:18:48.860]  There is no law in any state.
[01:18:48.860 --> 01:18:50.241]  You've got to vaccinate.
[01:18:50.241 --> 01:18:59.326]  They have policies through the state health department saying this is the list of recommended vaccines that if you don't have them, you're supposed to get a waiver.
[01:18:59.326 --> 01:19:04.650]  But then they'll lie to you thinking you're ignorant and tell you there is no waiver.
[01:19:04.650 --> 01:19:06.731]  Now they're trying to change the laws to make it mandatory.
[01:19:08.226 --> 01:19:13.910]  And you're not going to assault me with any of these vaccines you've jacked with stuff.
[01:19:13.910 --> 01:19:20.374]  Because my grandmother got polio weeks after she got the polio vaccine.
[01:19:20.374 --> 01:19:29.540]  My uncle almost died, my dad's brother, he's alive, when he took a tetanus shot working on a ranch and it almost killed him.
[01:19:29.540 --> 01:19:29.660]  And
[01:19:31.601 --> 01:19:33.423]  My dad got sick once taking a vaccine.
[01:19:33.423 --> 01:19:35.805]  My mother used to be a triathlete, never got sick.
[01:19:35.805 --> 01:19:40.949]  She almost died taking a flu shot like 12 years ago.
[01:19:40.949 --> 01:19:50.417]  They're full of garbage and they admit that a lot of the kids that take polio vaccines now, where they still give it over in Asia, end up getting, quote, paralyzed from it.
[01:19:50.417 --> 01:19:53.259]  They don't just call it polio.
[01:19:53.259 --> 01:19:54.300]  They call it paralysis.
[01:19:54.300 --> 01:19:55.921]  No, it gives you polio.
[01:19:55.921 --> 01:19:57.483]  I mean, that's a fact.
[01:19:57.483 --> 01:19:58.183]  That's a fact.
[01:19:58.183 --> 01:19:58.724]  We'll be right back.
[01:19:59.537 --> 01:20:02.439]  What good is a Big Berkey Water Filter?
[01:20:02.439 --> 01:20:05.981]  We get that question a lot here at BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[01:20:05.981 --> 01:20:08.143]  And in a word, the answer is protection.

[01:20:59.184 --> 01:21:01.587]  It's time for a home security quiz.
[01:21:01.587 --> 01:21:14.602]  What effective home security device is smaller than a coffee cup, fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home at your house while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is recommended by many police departments, and sells for less than $30?
[01:21:15.643 --> 01:21:17.564]  Yes, it's fake TV.
[01:21:17.564 --> 01:21:19.765]  This year, about 1 in every 50 U.S.
[01:21:19.765 --> 01:21:26.189]  homes will have a break-in with burglars usually picking the easy target, a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[01:21:26.189 --> 01:21:34.194]  Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching TV by simulating the light from a real TV.
[01:21:34.754 --> 01:21:40.458]  Fake TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked.
[01:21:40.458 --> 01:21:47.442]  To get your fake TV for only $29.95 with free shipping, go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.

[01:21:48.423 --> 01:21:50.664]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:01.681]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:22:01.681 --> 01:22:06.782]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:22:06.782 --> 01:22:14.903]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:22:14.903 --> 01:22:19.424]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:22:19.424 --> 01:22:23.225]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:22:23.405 --> 01:22:29.352]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:22:29.352 --> 01:22:32.515]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:22:32.515 --> 01:22:37.901]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from MyPatriotSupply.
[01:22:37.901 --> 01:22:45.469]  Go to MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist.

[01:22:58.519 --> 01:23:03.663]  It seems that everywhere you turn to these days, people are talking about the health benefits of silver.
[01:23:03.663 --> 01:23:06.785]  But don't be fooled into believing all silver is the same.
[01:23:06.785 --> 01:23:12.630]  Only one silver solution has been clinically shown to be hundreds of times stronger than colloidal or ionic silver.
[01:23:12.930 --> 01:23:15.112]  That's Supernatural Silver.
[01:23:15.112 --> 01:23:20.197]  It can be used internally as a powerful immune system enhancer to fight off bacteria and viruses.
[01:23:20.197 --> 01:23:25.021]  Supernatural Silver can be used topically to treat any type of wound or skin issue.
[01:23:25.021 --> 01:23:28.624]  It's even gentle enough to be used on the ears, eyes, and sinuses.
[01:23:28.624 --> 01:23:33.048]  And unlike harsh drugs and antibiotics, Supernatural Silver has no side effects.
[01:23:33.448 --> 01:23:38.291]  Available as a liquid or a gel that you can use every day to stay healthy and well.

[01:24:00.682 --> 01:24:01.403]  We are armed!
[01:24:03.229 --> 01:24:07.771]  What would you do if you knew all the things we knew?
[01:24:07.771 --> 01:24:09.872]  Would you stand up for true?
[01:24:09.872 --> 01:24:13.153]  Or would you turn away too?
[01:24:13.153 --> 01:24:17.955]  And then what if you saw all of the things that's wrong?
[01:24:17.955 --> 01:24:20.236]  Would you stand tall and strong?
[01:24:26.556 --> 01:24:32.198]  If the United States had state-run media, wouldn't it also have state-run churches?
[01:24:32.198 --> 01:24:33.218]  Well, it turns out we do.
[01:24:33.218 --> 01:24:37.439]  And that process has been going on since the 40s.
[01:24:37.439 --> 01:24:44.261]  Until now, under 501c3, churches tell their flocks, if you're at a church picnic, don't talk about politics.
[01:24:44.261 --> 01:24:44.981]  There is no law.
[01:24:46.630 --> 01:24:54.872]  The so-called regulations turn a church into a charity, and then now it's no longer a church, it's a state-run charity.
[01:24:54.872 --> 01:24:59.233]  That's the alchemy that is engaged in.
[01:24:59.233 --> 01:25:09.216]  Just like the private Federal Reserve took over from the issuance of currency and credit by the Congress, but called itself federal, and the power of the purse was removed in 1913, December 23rd.
[01:25:12.691 --> 01:25:17.834]  Joining us for the Balance of the Hour, a little bit in the next, is Pastor Chuck Baldwin.
[01:25:17.834 --> 01:25:22.017]  And his last column was his most read ever.
[01:25:22.017 --> 01:25:31.222]  And we're going to repost it right now to Infowars.com, dealing with the pastors deliberately misleading their flocks.
[01:25:31.222 --> 01:25:35.185]  And to me, more and more, this is the big issue.
[01:25:35.185 --> 01:25:41.809]  Because you'll have a lot of good rhetoric in these big megachurches, even small ones, but they're getting state-run information to get
[01:25:42.714 --> 01:25:46.523]  The faith-based initiative money.
[01:25:46.523 --> 01:25:51.053]  And that's why they won't go out and stop abortion, they won't criticize Obama, they won't do anything.
[01:25:51.735 --> 01:25:58.501]  But if you're a, quote, liberal church, you can say GD, America, and, you know, all the rest of it, and let's turn our guns in.
[01:25:58.501 --> 01:25:59.722]  That's okay.
[01:25:59.722 --> 01:26:02.604]  So to fight back against this is Pastor Chuck Baldwin.
[01:26:02.604 --> 01:26:04.086]  He's been fighting hard for a long time.
[01:26:04.086 --> 01:26:08.810]  He came out with his best-selling book a few years ago that we sell at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:26:08.810 --> 01:26:11.172]  We're 10% off everything until next week.
[01:26:11.172 --> 01:26:19.279]  Back to school special, Romans 13, the true meaning of submission, second edition, with Timothy Baldwin, his son,
[01:26:21.366 --> 01:26:23.287]  And more.
[01:26:23.287 --> 01:26:23.987]  I'm going from memory.
[01:26:23.987 --> 01:26:25.487]  Isn't Timothy a constitutional lawyer?
[01:26:25.487 --> 01:26:26.067]  I can't remember.
[01:26:26.067 --> 01:26:27.488]  He's a great interview as well.
[01:26:27.488 --> 01:26:30.909]  Pastor Baldwin, this is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[01:26:30.909 --> 01:26:35.910]  I want to get into the initiative some now, but then mainly into why we need this initiative.
[01:26:35.910 --> 01:26:37.331]  And plug the website.
[01:26:37.331 --> 01:26:39.151]  It's a beautiful new site.
[01:26:39.151 --> 01:26:42.672]  And I know this initiative's already exploding, even though you just announced it.
[01:26:42.672 --> 01:26:46.113]  Because the people are ready to be let out of Egypt right now.
[01:26:46.113 --> 01:26:48.254]  As soon as they learn they're actually in a government temple.
[01:26:48.894 --> 01:26:57.739]  With a government operative up there on the balcony, making them all feel good, I have a feeling this whole facade is going to crumble.
[01:26:57.739 --> 01:26:59.079]  Hey, thanks Alex.
[01:26:59.079 --> 01:27:00.280]  Yeah, you're exactly right.
[01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:11.926]  And yeah, my son is a constitutional attorney and he and I wrote the book on Romans 13 to debunk this ridiculous theory that Christians are supposed to submit to government no matter what.
[01:27:11.926 --> 01:27:16.308]  And they use Romans 13 as the predicate for that and of course it's erroneous, they believe.
[01:27:16.926 --> 01:27:30.652]  So we expose all that scripturally, using both the Old and the New Testament, to prove categorically that nowhere does God expect His people to submit to tyranny, no matter what government may say contrary.
[01:27:30.652 --> 01:27:44.459]  But the column you referred to, George Varna just came out with some fantastic research, a two-year project, where he was studying the churches and their political involvement, and if they were not involved, why not?
[01:27:45.160 --> 01:28:09.098]  And as a result of the survey, he released some information that I thought was really fascinating, one of which was that 90% of the pastors told him in the research that they knew, they knew that the Bible spoke to all of these political issues that we're dealing with today as a country, and yet they refused to deal with those issues.
[01:28:09.098 --> 01:28:11.820]  Now, to me, that was a staggering revelation.
[01:28:12.406 --> 01:28:18.010]  Because usually what you'll hear these preachers say is that, well, God hasn't called me to preach on that.
[01:28:18.010 --> 01:28:20.212]  I'm just supposed to preach the gospel.
[01:28:20.212 --> 01:28:22.493]  These things aren't relevant to the Bible.
[01:28:22.493 --> 01:28:23.774]  You know, pick the subject.
[01:28:23.774 --> 01:28:24.555]  It doesn't matter.
[01:28:24.555 --> 01:28:26.576]  The scripture is silent on these issues.
[01:28:26.576 --> 01:28:28.558]  And that's what a lot of times you will hear.
[01:28:28.558 --> 01:28:40.767]  But the survey said that they know, they know that the Bible speaks to all of these issues, but they are not going to address them because they're controversial, which means
[01:28:41.263 --> 01:28:45.885]  That they are deliberately refusing to address the truth.
[01:28:45.885 --> 01:28:51.227]  They are choosing to not tell their people the truth.
[01:28:51.227 --> 01:28:52.268]  They know what they're doing.
[01:28:52.268 --> 01:28:54.209]  That it's not ignorance.
[01:28:54.209 --> 01:28:59.551]  A lot of times you'll just say, well, my pastor, he just doesn't realize what's going on.
[01:28:59.551 --> 01:29:02.072]  It's premeditated deception.
[01:29:02.072 --> 01:29:02.732]  Exactly.
[01:29:02.732 --> 01:29:05.894]  Which ups the crime in God's eyes up big time.
[01:29:05.894 --> 01:29:07.254]  I agree with that totally.
[01:29:07.254 --> 01:29:09.095]  It is premeditated deception.
[01:29:09.611 --> 01:29:12.613]  This was a fascinating revelation.
[01:29:12.613 --> 01:29:20.859]  So now we can throw ignorance out forever as an excuse as to why these preachers are not willing to deal with the issues and tell the people what's going on.
[01:29:20.859 --> 01:29:21.400]  This is Hughes.
[01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:24.842]  We're going to break down your column and the cure to it.
[01:29:24.842 --> 01:29:29.125]  When we come back, we're having the column reposted right now to InfoWars.com.
[01:29:29.125 --> 01:29:30.526]  We'll tweet it out.
[01:29:30.526 --> 01:29:35.850]  State-run churches caught red-handed is what we're going to put the title up there.
[01:29:35.850 --> 01:29:37.991]  And we're going to break down his new initiative.
[01:29:38.872 --> 01:29:47.303]  That literally could change the world if you, the listeners, take action and help spread this Liberty Church movement.
[01:29:47.303 --> 01:29:48.224]  Stay with us.
[01:29:48.224 --> 01:29:48.905]  Infowars.com.
[01:29:48.905 --> 01:29:50.187]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.187 --> 01:29:51.789]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:51.789 --> 01:29:55.393]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.972 --> 01:30:06.141]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[01:30:06.141 --> 01:30:10.708]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[01:30:10.708 --> 01:30:15.275]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[01:30:15.675 --> 01:30:18.598]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[01:30:18.598 --> 01:30:24.062]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[01:30:24.062 --> 01:30:31.448]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[01:30:31.448 --> 01:30:35.571]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[01:30:35.571 --> 01:30:40.355]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:30:40.675 --> 01:30:49.120]  This is innovating, and the best part is it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:53.563]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[01:30:53.563 --> 01:30:59.026]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:30:59.775 --> 01:31:02.877]  This is Leanne McAdoo for InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:31:02.877 --> 01:31:09.000]  I'm here with Dr. Edward Group, Master Herbologist and Chief Formulator behind the InfoWarsLife products.
[01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:13.502]  Dr. Group, what have you been hearing from women who've started taking Super Female Vitality?
[01:31:13.502 --> 01:31:20.065]  You know, we've heard the reviews and feedback from Super Male Vitality from emails to even excited callers on the radio.
[01:31:20.385 --> 01:31:22.407]  Now, the answer for women is here.
[01:31:22.407 --> 01:31:34.075]  A new formulation specifically designed for the female body, Super Female Vitality, delivers 10 key herbs that work synergistically to revitalize the unique biology of women.
[01:31:34.075 --> 01:31:36.096]  I'm so glad that you guys made this for women.
[01:31:36.096 --> 01:31:41.820]  When he brought me home, the bottle of Super Female had tons of energy, tons of motivation, a lot of drive.
[01:31:41.820 --> 01:31:43.301]  My husband thinks I've been in a better mood.
[01:31:43.301 --> 01:31:45.483]  Our relationship, all I can say is this is a lot better now.
[01:31:45.783 --> 01:31:50.127]  I've just started taking Super Female Vitality from InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:31:50.127 --> 01:31:56.932]  Supplies are limited, so secure yours today at InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or dial 1-888-253-3139.
[01:31:56.932 --> 01:32:06.159]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[01:32:06.159 --> 01:32:09.502]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[01:32:09.602 --> 01:32:10.322]  Here we go, folks!

[01:35:04.993 --> 01:35:16.181]  All right, Pastor Chuck Baldwin, I'm gonna try to give you the floor now to break down, and we have just posted, the state-run church's article.
[01:35:17.162 --> 01:35:20.365]  to the top of Infowars.com in the featured news.
[01:35:20.365 --> 01:35:26.551]  It just went live about 20 seconds ago, I'm told, so folks need to hit refresh on Infowars.com.
[01:35:26.551 --> 01:35:29.294]  I'm also going to put your column out on Facebook.
[01:35:29.294 --> 01:35:31.376]  We're going to send it out right now on Twitter.
[01:35:31.376 --> 01:35:33.919]  Tweak that for me as well, guys.
[01:35:33.919 --> 01:35:37.603]  This national survey, and in two years of research, confirming
[01:35:38.163 --> 01:35:54.983]  The preachers know that they are deceiving people about what's happening and again the First Amendment clearly says Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or of the press and then it goes on to the rest of it.
[01:35:54.983 --> 01:35:57.586]  So how did the churches get to the point of saying,
[01:35:59.591 --> 01:36:01.152]  You can't say abortion's wrong.
[01:36:01.152 --> 01:36:03.533]  Hey, you can't say Obama's a liar.
[01:36:03.533 --> 01:36:06.454]  Hey, you can't say funding Al-Qaeda's wrong.
[01:36:06.454 --> 01:36:22.242]  You just, I mean, I've talked to people from Baptist churches, friends of mine, that have given me the printouts, where they tell them, when you go to any Bible luncheon, or you go to any retreat or anything, don't talk about politics or we're in violation of 501c3.
[01:36:22.242 --> 01:36:27.825]  So they've migrated that now from the preacher being a state-run church frontman, or woman,
[01:36:28.840 --> 01:36:35.718]  Down now to you're not even supposed to talk about anything with anybody from the church.
[01:36:35.718 --> 01:36:37.503]  I mean, these are now state-run cults.
[01:36:38.542 --> 01:36:41.143]  And if a tree fell and nobody heard it, did it make a sound?
[01:36:41.143 --> 01:36:46.205]  I talk to these preachers, some of these big megachurch preachers.
[01:36:46.205 --> 01:36:48.305]  And I'll say, hey, are you part of the clergy response team?
[01:36:48.305 --> 01:36:51.826]  And they'll go from being all fake and nice to like, hey, I can't talk to you.
[01:36:51.826 --> 01:36:55.688]  So a lot of them, it's beyond just being scared.
[01:36:55.688 --> 01:36:58.749]  They are knowing agents of the state.
[01:36:59.409 --> 01:37:03.230]  They think that secures them not being messed with with the IRS.
[01:37:03.230 --> 01:37:04.751]  They ought to be worried about God.
[01:37:04.751 --> 01:37:08.932]  They ought to be worried about what this country's turning into, even if they don't even believe in God.
[01:37:08.932 --> 01:37:11.013]  And they're just a fake preacher there to make money.
[01:37:11.013 --> 01:37:12.093]  A lot of them are.
[01:37:12.093 --> 01:37:14.554]  Shouldn't they be worried about where this country's going?
[01:37:14.554 --> 01:37:16.654]  Pastor, break it down for folks.
[01:37:16.654 --> 01:37:18.235]  Well, you're exactly right.
[01:37:18.235 --> 01:37:24.817]  And at the end of the column, I mentioned the part of the survey where you just alluded to where that
[01:37:25.495 --> 01:37:32.320]  They asked the survey question at the end that I relayed is, you know, what is the reason for this?
[01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:51.794]  And in the article I exposed how that 90% of the pastors that were surveyed indicate that they know that the Bible speaks to these salient issues that you deal with every day, and so do I. But they refuse to deal with them because they're controversial.
[01:37:51.794 --> 01:37:53.756]  And in the article it also points out
[01:37:54.232 --> 01:38:02.657]  The five measures of success that the pastors look to to determine the success of their work.
[01:38:02.657 --> 01:38:12.384]  And those five items are attendance, giving, number of programs, number of staff, and square footage of their building.
[01:38:12.384 --> 01:38:13.504]  That's the things they look to.
[01:38:13.504 --> 01:38:17.487]  As far as they're concerned, that's the measure of their success.
[01:38:17.487 --> 01:38:23.090]  It's amazing to me that they have nothing in there of, you know, where do you find that in the Book of Acts?
[01:38:23.090 --> 01:38:23.831]  Where do you find that?
[01:38:24.286 --> 01:38:25.147]  In the early church.
[01:38:25.147 --> 01:38:28.348]  Where do you find any of that in the Bible whatsoever?
[01:38:28.348 --> 01:38:33.691]  Attendance, giving, number of programs, number of staff, square footage.
[01:38:33.691 --> 01:38:47.199]  So anything that they think is going to diminish any one of those five items, success items, are going to be avoided like the plague by these pastors.
[01:38:47.199 --> 01:38:51.982]  And so, they refuse to deal with the issues, even though they know that they are biblically based.
[01:38:52.652 --> 01:38:56.453]  To me, that was a great revelation, because now we're not talking about ignorance.
[01:38:56.453 --> 01:38:59.214]  We're talking about deliberate disobedience.
[01:38:59.214 --> 01:39:12.618]  So when you get down to the bottom of the article, and you say, okay, what was the number one reason why the pastors refused to deal with the issues, outside of the fact that it's controversial, and it may interfere with their success, and you got it.
[01:39:12.618 --> 01:39:17.139]  The 501c3 IRS tax exempt status.
[01:39:17.139 --> 01:39:20.460]  Turning churches into non-profit charity corporations.
[01:39:21.403 --> 01:39:27.308]  So, now we see where it's more than just the fear of not being successful.
[01:39:27.308 --> 01:39:35.535]  It's more than just, alright, I may lose people, I may lose giving, you know, I may lose my success rate among the community.
[01:39:35.535 --> 01:39:36.435]  It's more than that.
[01:39:36.435 --> 01:39:40.819]  Now, it's fear of losing tax exempt status.
[01:39:40.819 --> 01:39:46.804]  Fear of losing the contributions that may result from the loss of the tax exempt status.
[01:39:46.804 --> 01:39:48.586]  So, of course, this goes back to 1954 when LBJ, then Senator,
[01:39:50.879 --> 01:39:57.245]  introduced this monster into the Senate, it became law, and now we've been dealing with it for all these years.
[01:39:57.245 --> 01:40:00.107]  And it, of course, has evolved to what it is today.
[01:40:00.107 --> 01:40:18.583]  And what it is today is an axe that's being held over the necks of the pastors, intimidating them from saying anything that might be deemed political, and as you know, especially on the so-called conservative side of the issue.
[01:40:19.338 --> 01:40:31.208]  So that they will be silenced as a church, which is the greatest opportunity, the greatest force for good in the country, is the pulpits of America.
[01:40:31.208 --> 01:40:37.633]  I mean, where would America be, Alex, without the Black Regiment Pastors of Colonial America in 1775 and 1776?
[01:40:37.633 --> 01:40:38.634]  Where would we have been?
[01:40:40.868 --> 01:40:42.768]  There would have been no Bunker Hill.
[01:40:42.768 --> 01:40:45.669]  There would have been no shot fired around the world.
[01:40:45.669 --> 01:40:47.689]  There would have been no Declaration of Independence.
[01:40:47.689 --> 01:40:50.110]  There would have been no separation from Great Britain.
[01:40:50.110 --> 01:40:59.552]  It all began from the Patriot pulpits in America where the pastors were speaking out for freedom and liberty and showing them the biblical reasons for this.
[01:40:59.552 --> 01:41:03.473]  But this is not just something that's a political issue.
[01:41:03.473 --> 01:41:05.013]  But this is a spiritual issue.
[01:41:05.013 --> 01:41:06.573]  It's a Bible issue.
[01:41:06.573 --> 01:41:07.433]  And here's why.
[01:41:07.433 --> 01:41:08.314]  Chapter and verse.
[01:41:08.314 --> 01:41:09.714]  Here's the principle.
[01:41:09.714 --> 01:41:10.694]  Here's the doctrine.
[01:41:11.385 --> 01:41:34.749]  And they taught those issues to the people, so that when the time came for those gallant men to stand on Lexington Green, which was just outside the church house at the Church of Lexington, where most of those men worshipped every Sunday with their muskets in hand in the early morning hours of April 19, 1775, and withstood the British, and eight men immediately lost their lives from the British open fire.
[01:41:35.188 --> 01:41:35.629]  I don't know.
[01:41:45.379 --> 01:41:48.882]  taught his men these fundamental principles of liberty.
[01:41:48.882 --> 01:42:00.631]  That's right, and the British newspapers, I know you write in your book, but I've looked it up, it's on record, cursed what they called the Black Brigades, and they knew full well who led the American Revolution.
[01:42:00.631 --> 01:42:02.232]  Absolutely, and they gave due credit.
[01:42:02.232 --> 01:42:09.678]  That's why they call them the Black Regiment, because they saw them as the leaders of the fight for revolution.
[01:42:10.336 --> 01:42:17.079]  And they knew that the pastors were the ones that were giving them the moral and the spiritual inspiration to do what needed to be done.
[01:42:17.079 --> 01:42:20.661]  So what do we not have today that they had then?
[01:42:20.661 --> 01:42:22.862]  I mean, there's a lot of things that are exciting going on.
[01:42:22.862 --> 01:42:24.442]  The enemy knew what to do.
[01:42:24.442 --> 01:42:25.923]  They captured the church.
[01:42:25.923 --> 01:42:26.463]  That's right.
[01:42:26.463 --> 01:42:28.824]  Turned it into a government instrument.
[01:42:28.824 --> 01:42:29.985]  That's right.
[01:42:29.985 --> 01:42:31.605]  That's what we don't have.
[01:42:31.605 --> 01:42:34.307]  We don't have the Patriot pulpit, Alex.
[01:42:34.307 --> 01:42:37.488]  And that's the whole purpose of my initiative, the Builder to Church Project.
[01:42:37.955 --> 01:42:43.097]  Which it took me two months to launch, but now we have the money to do it and we're launching.
[01:42:43.097 --> 01:42:45.578]  The application form is live.
[01:42:45.578 --> 01:43:01.404]  People around the country who want to start a non-501c3 church can go to the website, they can fill out the application, and we can begin the process of trying to go around the country and help these people start fresh, new, non-501c3 churches.
[01:43:01.404 --> 01:43:06.106]  And get this, there's a lot of pastors around the country, ordained ministers,
[01:43:06.639 --> 01:43:12.124]  Hundreds of them that I know of who are wanting a congregation that's not 501c3.
[01:43:12.124 --> 01:43:21.692]  You've got to remember that there's a lot of these pastors whose eyes have awakened as well, Alex, and they're wanting to get out of that 501c3 system.
[01:43:21.692 --> 01:43:26.697]  And they want to find a group of people that are willing to have a non-501c3 church.
[01:43:26.697 --> 01:43:30.360]  And they, you know, if we can get together these ministers, kind of like a
[01:43:31.365 --> 01:43:39.231]  A glorified eHarmony.com, you know, where we're matching these independent pastors that are willing to speak out on the issue.
[01:43:39.231 --> 01:43:48.198]  And these people that are tired, sick and tired of these 501c3 churches where the pastors refuse to say anything from the pulpit that's controversial.
[01:43:48.198 --> 01:43:53.782]  And get these people together so that they can start some brand new non-501c3 churches.
[01:43:53.782 --> 01:43:57.605]  And you're right also, Alex, when you said that this could change the country.
[01:43:58.035 --> 01:44:03.357]  Because the way the pulpits go, the way that the church goes, is the way that the nation goes.
[01:44:03.357 --> 01:44:18.244]  And if we can, over the next several years, make so that there could be hundreds, hundreds of brand new, not 501c3 churches starting up, people beginning to get aware, the message is going out, people are coming in.
[01:44:18.244 --> 01:44:21.085]  I mean, it could be revolutionary.
[01:44:21.085 --> 01:44:23.626]  The hope of America has never been in the White House.
[01:44:23.626 --> 01:44:25.087]  It's always been in the church house.
[01:44:26.826 --> 01:44:54.676]  And if you look at the last 50 years since the CIA on record took over the big churches and pushed the megachurch agenda and used it as a front and others, it's been about turn them into self-help motivational speakers who go in and make everybody feel good and then make the preacher a deity and then turn it into a big social club where there's a country club at the church and everybody vacations with the church
[01:44:55.615 --> 01:45:01.141]  And you do business with the church, and I guess you cheat on your wife at the church.
[01:45:01.141 --> 01:45:04.225]  I mean, really, they've just become country clubs.
[01:45:04.225 --> 01:45:14.256]  And you're literally up there just to push the establishment line, just to make a bunch of people feel good.
[01:45:15.774 --> 01:45:19.075]  And I've done an analysis of this.
[01:45:19.075 --> 01:45:26.118]  You go back to the Rockefeller Foundation, the World Council of Churches, the National Council of Churches, the ecumenical movement, all of it.
[01:45:26.118 --> 01:45:31.180]  You go from the conservative churches that aren't involved politically now to the so-called leftist churches.
[01:45:31.180 --> 01:45:39.604]  Man, they are Bill and Melinda Gates, eugenics, world government, open borders, take the crosses out, New Age.
[01:45:39.604 --> 01:45:41.665]  I mean, I've been to the big churches in Austin.
[01:45:42.245 --> 01:45:46.367]  The big leftist churches, and I mean it is frightening!
[01:45:46.367 --> 01:46:02.116]  Just like every Disney movie, the leader's a woman, men are bad, well the preachers are all women, and Obama's Jesus, and I mean they really know what they're doing, and you, because I've gone and watched it, and you go watch these preachers, they know what they're doing.
[01:46:02.116 --> 01:46:06.799]  These are agents of the state running shy-ops, and we even have the documents.
[01:46:06.799 --> 01:46:08.200]  I mean that's the issue here folks.
[01:46:08.800 --> 01:46:10.461]  Well, if they go to libertychurchproject.com
[01:46:36.380 --> 01:46:38.802]  LibertyChurchProject.com.
[01:46:38.802 --> 01:46:41.044]  LibertyChurchProject.com.
[01:46:41.044 --> 01:46:43.085]  We're going to tweet that address out as well.
[01:46:43.085 --> 01:46:46.888]  It's in your column that we just reposted to InfoWars.com.
[01:46:46.888 --> 01:46:48.530]  But I want to cover the waterfront.
[01:46:48.530 --> 01:46:50.952]  Look at the judgment against America.
[01:46:50.952 --> 01:46:53.714]  Look at how the floodgates are opening.
[01:46:53.714 --> 01:46:59.538]  I believe, and I can feel it, that the hedge, or like a gate, or castle walls,
[01:47:00.672 --> 01:47:02.873]  Have now fallen about 30 percent.
[01:47:02.873 --> 01:47:06.196]  I've been describing this last few years as they're down 10 percent, they're down 20 percent.
[01:47:06.196 --> 01:47:09.438]  Now they're down to 30 and now they're falling fast.
[01:47:09.438 --> 01:47:12.980]  In the next few years, Al Qaeda is being openly funded and protected.
[01:47:12.980 --> 01:47:14.401]  The borders are wide open.
[01:47:14.401 --> 01:47:15.922]  World government's being announced.
[01:47:15.922 --> 01:47:22.346]  Obama and the executive is operating by executive fee out on every front.
[01:47:22.346 --> 01:47:25.088]  New fines, fees, regulations, global taxes.
[01:47:26.718 --> 01:47:35.800]  The flood of evil is coming in, and I wanted you to speak to that, to the borders, to just everything that's happening right now.
[01:47:35.800 --> 01:47:41.061]  Yeah, well, it is not the job of the pastor to be the watchman on the wall.
[01:47:41.061 --> 01:47:45.162]  I mean, Alex, this is the thing that just bugs the stew out of me.
[01:47:45.162 --> 01:47:48.523]  The whole concept of the shepherd, the minister,
[01:47:49.176 --> 01:47:51.617]  Is that he's a watchman on the wall.
[01:47:51.617 --> 01:48:02.303]  He is the man that stands up in the pulpit, Sunday by Sunday, and warns his people, the flock, the sheep of the church, of the danger of the impending wolf.
[01:48:02.303 --> 01:48:03.964]  No matter what that might be.
[01:48:03.964 --> 01:48:06.185]  You know, it could be a local issue.
[01:48:06.185 --> 01:48:10.387]  It could be strictly a spiritual issue within the congregation.
[01:48:10.387 --> 01:48:12.348]  Or it could be a community issue.
[01:48:12.348 --> 01:48:16.070]  It could be a national issue, like you're describing this border issue right now.
[01:48:17.119 --> 01:48:23.500]  And you're right, they use the churches to fulfill the agenda that they have.
[01:48:23.500 --> 01:48:32.642]  And in the border situation, we see this constantly, where they're using the pastors and the churches to promote the open border concept.
[01:48:32.642 --> 01:48:43.244]  And the average pastor who, in his heart, knows right from wrong, and he knows that it's harmful to his country, he knows it's harmful to his grandkids, he knows it's harmful to freedom,
[01:48:43.743 --> 01:49:01.398]  And yet, because of his fear of the 501c3 tax exempt status, his fear of losing attendance, offering, his fear of maybe not being able to build the bigger building, and let's not forget this too, a lot of these churches are head over heels in debt.
[01:49:01.398 --> 01:49:04.781]  They are up to their eyeballs in indebtedness.
[01:49:04.781 --> 01:49:10.766]  And if they have a 5-10% disruption in income, they are really going to feel it.
[01:49:10.766 --> 01:49:11.507]  I mean to tell you,
[01:49:11.946 --> 01:49:14.969]  They are just to the max in debt.
[01:49:14.969 --> 01:49:28.003]  And so they're out there looking at the crowd and they say, you know, if I say something controversial, I may lose 5% of my crowd, 5% of my giving, I can't meet the payroll, I've got staff, I've got insurance, I've got retirement benefits, I've got all these obligations.
[01:49:28.363 --> 01:49:29.223]  It's not a church!
[01:49:29.223 --> 01:49:29.663]  It's not a church!
[01:49:29.663 --> 01:49:32.964]  It's a self-help country club and the whole country's going to hell in a handbasket.
[01:49:32.964 --> 01:49:33.104]  Yeah.
[01:49:57.153 --> 01:50:00.196]  We've lost the entire principle of truth.
[01:50:00.196 --> 01:50:06.763]  And the reason is, is that one of the reasons, I think one of the biggest reasons is the 501c3 tax exempt status.
[01:50:06.763 --> 01:50:15.672]  And that's why, I mean, what I've been doing, what I'm doing now is the result of like over a year of deliberation and prayer and how can I do that?
[01:50:15.672 --> 01:50:16.453]  What can I do?
[01:50:16.983 --> 01:50:19.824]  And people were calling me and writing me all the time.
[01:50:19.824 --> 01:50:21.444]  Chuck, what can we do?
[01:50:21.444 --> 01:50:22.045]  This is it.
[01:50:22.045 --> 01:50:23.205]  No, this is huge.
[01:50:23.205 --> 01:50:25.126]  This strikes right at the root of it.
[01:50:25.126 --> 01:50:26.786]  Right at the heart of it.
[01:50:26.786 --> 01:50:29.027]  And the churches have been conned.
[01:50:29.027 --> 01:50:30.407]  People want a mission.
[01:50:30.407 --> 01:50:31.768]  People want leadership.
[01:50:31.768 --> 01:50:33.308]  People want the challenge.
[01:50:33.308 --> 01:50:35.249]  They want to hear how bad it is.
[01:50:35.249 --> 01:50:37.469]  Because they already deep down know how bad it is.
[01:50:37.469 --> 01:50:39.330]  They want to be led against evil.
[01:50:39.750 --> 01:50:53.364]  They don't want to sit around at a government-run church with some fake preacher up there about how great he is who's just up there basically eyeing all the widows so they can suck money out of him so he can go on a bigger vacation.
[01:50:53.364 --> 01:50:56.988]  Those places aren't churches and people need to get out of them.
[01:50:56.988 --> 01:50:58.630]  We'll be back with Pastor Chuck Baldwin.

[01:51:14.070 --> 01:51:17.591]  Teenagers like me used to think our parents were just weird.
[01:51:17.591 --> 01:51:21.953]  Because they put their phones and computers inside those flimsy little fake leather cases.
[01:51:21.953 --> 01:51:24.254]  Then my folks both got a Blocket Pocket.
[01:51:24.254 --> 01:51:27.055]  Mom knows it keeps her safe from the phone's radiation.
[01:51:27.055 --> 01:51:29.716]  Dad knows it keeps his information private.
[01:51:29.716 --> 01:51:32.717]  I like my Blocket Pocket because it blocks hacking and tracking.
[01:51:32.717 --> 01:51:33.657]  Awesome!
[01:51:33.657 --> 01:51:36.018]  BlocketPocket.com has other cool stuff too.

[01:53:59.761 --> 01:54:15.926]  People say, hey, let us have a big centralized government that runs everything and cares about us.
[01:54:17.040 --> 01:54:25.146]  No, it is a predatory globalist system and that's why we're in so much trouble.
[01:54:25.146 --> 01:54:31.811]  And I have been to a lot of churches, folks, and very few of them have the courage to tell the truth.
[01:54:31.811 --> 01:54:39.796]  I've found there's actually a lot of 501c3 churches now that are criticizing the criminal government and are telling the truth.
[01:54:39.796 --> 01:54:41.838]  So I think you either do one of two things or both.
[01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:52.826]  You go and you set up your own 501c3 outside of it and find people that want to support so you can reach out in the community with the truth?
[01:54:52.826 --> 01:55:01.471]  Or you do what a lot of churches have done and pledge to break the blockade where they claim that churches don't have a right to the First Amendment.
[01:55:01.471 --> 01:55:07.155]  Now I get they claim, well you're no longer a church, you're a 501c3, but they still act like you're a church.
[01:55:07.155 --> 01:55:09.096]  So you can hold the First Amendment up there.
[01:55:09.096 --> 01:55:11.097]  I think it trumps that whole charity law.
[01:55:12.759 --> 01:55:14.781]  Because it's all fraud based.
[01:55:14.781 --> 01:55:21.607]  It's kind of like people 20 years ago didn't know the Federal Reserve was private and would laugh at you if you said it and the ADL said it was racist.
[01:55:21.607 --> 01:55:24.790]  Now almost everyone in national polls knows it's private.
[01:55:24.790 --> 01:55:27.132]  They want it audited or abolished.
[01:55:27.132 --> 01:55:31.135]  We've passed it twice in the House to audit it and the Senate's killed it.
[01:55:31.135 --> 01:55:33.598]  So we've gone from nowhere to somewhere.
[01:55:34.361 --> 01:55:42.927]  And Chuck, again Pastor Chuck Baldwin's our guest right now, I think that's really the good news here is people don't know what they've had until it's gone.
[01:55:42.927 --> 01:55:47.371]  And there is an awakening happening.
[01:55:47.371 --> 01:55:49.512]  But it's more of a division.
[01:55:49.512 --> 01:55:54.076]  People are either waking up and they're getting more awake or they're falling deeper into delusion.
[01:55:54.963 --> 01:56:00.166]  But the people that are in delusion, I found, aren't even really conscious.
[01:56:00.166 --> 01:56:01.606]  And so they're not even really in the game.
[01:56:01.606 --> 01:56:05.508]  So there's a lot of positive things happening right now.
[01:56:05.508 --> 01:56:08.890]  And if our listeners will go out and show this to their pastors, challenge them,
[01:56:11.010 --> 01:56:12.391]  And then hold their feet to the fire.
[01:56:12.391 --> 01:56:15.973]  I think a lot of them will make the decision to do the right thing.
[01:56:15.973 --> 01:56:17.994]  But separately, what about the movement?
[01:56:17.994 --> 01:56:25.599]  Because I know you're aware of all the different developments out there that I've seen of even big churches to say, no, we're going to say no to the system.
[01:56:25.599 --> 01:56:34.764]  We're not going to be bullied, especially when Democratic affiliated so-called churches can do whatever they want politically.
[01:56:34.764 --> 01:56:39.827]  So I'm saying even within the 501c3 system, it's not equally enforced.
[01:56:39.827 --> 01:56:40.588]  So it's a fraud.
[01:56:41.755 --> 01:56:44.296]  Well, yeah, it's not equally enforcing.
[01:56:44.296 --> 01:56:48.118]  In fact, it's more intimidation than anything else.
[01:56:48.118 --> 01:57:07.109]  Look, I used to pastor a 501c3 church, Alex, as you know, and I remember I would get, about twice a year, I would get a letter in the mail from usually a law firm representing the IRS, and it would say, okay, as a pastor, here's the things you can do, point, point, point.
[01:57:07.109 --> 01:57:09.610]  Here's the things you can't do, point, point, point.
[01:57:09.610 --> 01:57:11.091]  As a church, here's what you can do.
[01:57:11.861 --> 01:57:13.102]  Here's what you can't do.
[01:57:13.102 --> 01:57:14.503]  I would get that about twice a year.
[01:57:14.503 --> 01:57:16.825]  Now I would just throw it in the garbage can.
[01:57:16.825 --> 01:57:18.786]  It didn't faze me a bit.
[01:57:18.786 --> 01:57:21.508]  And by the way, you had a big church.
[01:57:21.508 --> 01:57:23.169]  It was fairly big, yeah.
[01:57:23.169 --> 01:57:28.253]  And you know, we were still preaching and we were putting out the message, etc.
[01:57:28.253 --> 01:57:29.473]  And we were 501c3.
[01:57:29.473 --> 01:57:31.595]  But I'm telling you, the problem is,
[01:57:32.772 --> 01:57:40.897]  When 95% or more of the pastors receive those letters in the mail, and they are frequent.
[01:57:40.897 --> 01:57:44.219]  They're at least a couple, three times a year they're going to get these.
[01:57:44.219 --> 01:57:47.801]  And they go over these things, point by point.
[01:57:47.801 --> 01:57:49.803]  95% of them are going to submit.
[01:57:49.803 --> 01:57:55.246]  95% of them are going to be... Can you imagine if the Pharisees would have told Christ what he could preach?
[01:57:55.717 --> 01:57:58.139]  Well, I mean, I just preached yesterday from John 7.
[01:57:58.139 --> 01:58:00.841]  I mean, the Pharisees hated Jesus from the beginning.
[01:58:00.841 --> 01:58:03.643]  They did everything they could to silence him and then to kill him.
[01:58:03.643 --> 01:58:06.785]  And, you know, he was constantly at war with the Pharisees.
[01:58:06.785 --> 01:58:11.268]  And it was nothing more than what we see today, the modern-day elitism today.
[01:58:11.268 --> 01:58:14.190]  The Pharisees of old are the modern-day elitist today.
[01:58:14.190 --> 01:58:17.432]  The globalists are the same group of people.
[01:58:17.432 --> 01:58:20.194]  They're the ones that are trying to silence the truth.
[01:58:20.194 --> 01:58:22.996]  And that 501c3 fact-exempt status was a
[01:58:24.324 --> 01:58:29.226]  An ingenious invention by Lyndon Johnson to accomplish the exact... Hey, it's LBJ!
[01:58:29.226 --> 01:58:33.048]  He created the welfare and ruined the... I mean, he just ruined everything.
[01:58:33.048 --> 01:58:34.129]  They know what they're doing.
[01:58:34.129 --> 01:58:37.731]  We'll do five more minutes with Chuck Baldwin, then we'll go to Weldon and others that are holding.
[01:58:37.731 --> 01:58:42.193]  Stay with us.
[01:58:42.193 --> 01:58:43.533]  Third hour's coming up, folks.
[01:58:43.533 --> 01:58:46.355]  I got a lot of important news I haven't gotten to yet.
[01:58:46.355 --> 01:58:48.776]  Political correctness, and I've got this other story.
[01:58:49.861 --> 01:58:53.522]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:58:53.522 --> 01:58:57.784]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:58:57.784 --> 01:58:59.564]  Can you put two and two together?

[02:00:30.206 --> 02:00:30.587]  Weldon?
[02:00:32.122 --> 02:00:41.144]  Jay, Dale, Michael, I'm going to your calls and I'm getting into the AI technology news and political correctness.
[02:00:41.144 --> 02:00:45.325]  Finishing up with Chuck Baldwin, Pastor Chuck Baldwin with his initiative.
[02:00:45.325 --> 02:00:49.226]  People want to do something, this is it.
[02:00:49.226 --> 02:00:58.288]  Go to your mega churches, talk to your pastor, try to get them to talk about the big picture and how the state's trying to fully take over churches.
[02:00:58.288 --> 02:01:00.669]  And if they're scared to talk about that, well, they're not a church.
[02:01:02.625 --> 02:01:06.228]  We all grew up hearing about the Soviet Union and it allowed state-run churches.
[02:01:06.228 --> 02:01:08.730]  China allows state-run churches.
[02:01:08.730 --> 02:01:10.371]  They're just state-run.
[02:01:10.371 --> 02:01:13.073]  The churches that get shut down are the ones that aren't.
[02:01:13.073 --> 02:01:14.994]  And we're only a few steps away from that.
[02:01:14.994 --> 02:01:21.339]  Thank God there's enough Americans out there and enough pastors who've been basically ignoring this.
[02:01:21.339 --> 02:01:28.084]  But if you want to see where we're going, again, if you look at what so-called leftist churches are doing, really authoritarian churches,
[02:01:29.724 --> 02:01:41.494]  From Austin to San Francisco, from Dallas to Chicago, they are nothing but Democratic Party, New World Order, Cloward and Piven centers.
[02:01:41.494 --> 02:01:46.618]  And they're calling for totally open borders right now, that they know will collapse the country.
[02:01:46.618 --> 02:01:50.261]  I mean, these are really sinister organizations.
[02:01:50.261 --> 02:01:53.884]  Chuck, any closing points on that?
[02:01:53.884 --> 02:01:55.645]  Yeah, Alex, just I want to thank you very much.
[02:01:55.645 --> 02:01:58.708]  I want to encourage people to go to the website chuckballmanlive.com
[02:01:59.489 --> 02:02:02.552]  And from that point, they can access the Liberty Church Project.
[02:02:02.552 --> 02:02:12.020]  I just want to appeal to people again, because Alex, you've got a lot of listeners out there right now that they know the truth, and they're Christian people.
[02:02:12.020 --> 02:02:16.244]  They want a non-501c3 church where they can fellowship.
[02:02:16.244 --> 02:02:19.467]  They're tired of the cowardice of their pastors.
[02:02:19.467 --> 02:02:25.492]  They're tired of the way the people in congregations look at them like they're from Mars because they stand for the truth.
[02:02:25.891 --> 02:02:34.234]  They want to join together with like-minded fellow patriots in a Christian church and worship the Lord as they know they should.
[02:02:34.234 --> 02:02:37.475]  And they can't find those pastors and churches.
[02:02:37.475 --> 02:02:44.318]  We are helping people all over the country to start brand new non-501c3 fellowships.
[02:02:44.318 --> 02:02:49.820]  We are bringing ministers together with people who want to have a patriot pulpit.
[02:02:49.820 --> 02:02:55.602]  There's a lot of ministers out there that are not able to minister freely in the denomination and the churches where they are.
[02:02:56.075 --> 02:03:01.437]  And they're looking for churches that are willing to have a Patriot pastor join them.
[02:03:01.437 --> 02:03:04.719]  And there are people out there that are wanting a Patriot pastor.
[02:03:04.719 --> 02:03:20.745]  And so what we're doing is, all they've got to do is go to the website libertychurchproject.com, fill out the application, someone from our office will be in touch with them, we'll start the process, we will at some point, if everything, all our ducks in a row and they're really serious about it,
[02:03:21.334 --> 02:03:22.835]  We will go visit them.
[02:03:22.835 --> 02:03:25.618]  I have a team of people that are going to be with me.
[02:03:25.618 --> 02:03:27.480]  This is a big project.
[02:03:27.480 --> 02:03:32.304]  We come in and we help these people start non-501c3 churches.
[02:03:32.304 --> 02:03:33.105]  And you've done this.
[02:03:33.105 --> 02:03:34.286]  You've started them all over the country.
[02:03:34.286 --> 02:03:35.707]  You've started your own successfully.
[02:03:35.707 --> 02:03:36.368]  Right.
[02:03:36.368 --> 02:03:41.332]  And helped other churches there in the mountain area you are, Wyoming, Montana area.
[02:03:41.332 --> 02:03:41.893]  That's right.
[02:03:41.893 --> 02:03:44.335]  And it's very exciting.
[02:03:44.335 --> 02:03:47.458]  And so big things have small beginnings.
[02:03:48.178 --> 02:04:00.003]  And you've already had a huge effect, Chuck, with tens of millions of people, with syndicated radio, and the big church you built in Florida, and then leaving that big church, and going and setting up a non-501c3.
[02:04:00.003 --> 02:04:04.565]  So you've walked the walk, you've talked the talk, and then walked the walk.
[02:04:04.565 --> 02:04:05.925]  You've gone out there, you've done it.
[02:04:05.925 --> 02:04:08.726]  We salute you, Pastor Chuck Baldwin.
[02:04:08.726 --> 02:04:12.188]  But, I mean, regardless, even if people aren't Christians and are secular,
[02:04:12.768 --> 02:04:19.752]  They should realize having free independent churches that promote liberty is a good thing, not having state-run media.
[02:04:19.752 --> 02:04:24.555]  Everyone recognizes state-run media, state-run churches is the hallmark of a tyranny.
[02:04:25.504 --> 02:04:26.124]  Absolutely.
[02:04:26.124 --> 02:04:36.850]  In fact, here at our Church at Liberty Fellowship in Kalispell, Montana, we have unbelievers, non-Christians that attend our service every Sunday because they love the message of truth.
[02:04:36.850 --> 02:04:40.672]  This is a, you know, liberty is for everybody, not just for somebody.
[02:04:40.672 --> 02:04:41.932]  It's for everybody.
[02:04:41.932 --> 02:04:42.673]  Yeah, that's what I found.
[02:04:42.673 --> 02:04:45.895]  We don't Bible thump here and we get more people to come to Christ.
[02:04:45.895 --> 02:04:47.215]  It's the same thing you do.
[02:04:47.215 --> 02:04:52.178]  Yeah, of course, a lot of those folks you've told me that are coming that are non-believers, they end up finding Christ, don't they?
[02:04:52.178 --> 02:04:53.098]  That's right.
[02:04:53.098 --> 02:04:54.219]  Most of them do, Alex.
[02:04:54.759 --> 02:04:55.660]  Very exciting.
[02:04:55.660 --> 02:04:56.500]  God bless you, sir.
[02:04:56.500 --> 02:04:57.221]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:04:57.221 --> 02:04:59.822]  A real pastor right there.
[02:04:59.822 --> 02:05:02.064]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[02:05:02.064 --> 02:05:10.129]  Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:05:10.129 --> 02:05:17.274]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[02:05:17.634 --> 02:05:22.238]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago, and I must say, that's good stuff.
[02:05:22.238 --> 02:05:32.887]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[02:05:32.887 --> 02:05:39.372]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[02:05:39.372 --> 02:05:41.714]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[02:05:41.714 --> 02:05:45.577]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and getting the day started.
[02:05:45.737 --> 02:05:47.678]  It's not just the super male vitality.

[02:05:59.902 --> 02:06:06.064]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[02:06:06.064 --> 02:06:10.625]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[02:06:10.625 --> 02:06:15.207]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[02:06:15.607 --> 02:06:18.530]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[02:06:18.530 --> 02:06:23.975]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[02:06:23.975 --> 02:06:31.361]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[02:06:31.361 --> 02:06:35.505]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[02:06:35.505 --> 02:06:40.289]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:06:40.589 --> 02:06:49.055]  This is innovating, and the best part is it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[02:06:49.055 --> 02:06:53.498]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.

[02:07:34.378 --> 02:07:36.519]  This is not a low-grade formula.
[02:07:36.519 --> 02:07:47.704]  We are working with one of the top laboratory manufacturers in the United States to bring you the best form of colloidal silver using electrical processes within a base of deionized water.

[02:07:58.548 --> 02:08:04.190]  We are on the march.
[02:08:04.190 --> 02:08:05.671]  The Empire is on the run.
[02:08:05.671 --> 02:08:07.992]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:18.871 --> 02:08:21.953]  Alright, I want to get into the latest on what's happening in Ferguson, Missouri.
[02:08:21.953 --> 02:08:25.595]  I want to look at a new report by Pew Research.
[02:08:25.595 --> 02:08:28.097]  Robots will take over more jobs than they create.
[02:08:28.097 --> 02:08:30.698]  I want to look at the big picture on that.
[02:08:30.698 --> 02:08:35.221]  Also, IBM coming out with chips that mimic the human brain.
[02:08:35.221 --> 02:08:40.324]  Incredible political correctness with the so-called First Lady.
[02:08:40.324 --> 02:08:41.164]  And more.
[02:08:41.164 --> 02:08:45.747]  But look, sometimes we start taking calls one hour, a guest comes on, people patiently hold.
[02:08:45.747 --> 02:08:46.468]  I want to go to Weldon.
[02:08:47.632 --> 02:08:52.033]  And I want to go to Dale and others that have been patiently holding.
[02:08:52.033 --> 02:08:53.174]  So let's go quickly to your calls.
[02:08:53.174 --> 02:08:56.135]  Weldon, thank you so much for holding from Ohio.
[02:08:56.135 --> 02:08:56.755]  You're on the air.
[02:08:56.755 --> 02:08:58.335]  Go ahead.
[02:08:58.335 --> 02:08:59.396]  OK, Alex.
[02:08:59.396 --> 02:09:00.636]  Good to talk to you.
[02:09:00.636 --> 02:09:03.277]  Good to talk to you.
[02:09:03.277 --> 02:09:06.438]  Last weekend, we had a hoax here in Toledo.
[02:09:06.438 --> 02:09:12.940]  They said we had too high levels of microcystin in the water and they banned us from drinking.
[02:09:12.940 --> 02:09:14.540]  And that lasted like two days.
[02:09:14.540 --> 02:09:16.261]  And on Monday, it was all OK.
[02:09:17.324 --> 02:09:25.501]  But in the end, it all boiled down to we need to spend a half a billion dollars on our water system to upgrade it now.
[02:09:26.007 --> 02:09:48.654]  Yeah, I saw that, and for those that don't know, about 15 years ago they passed federal regulations which made it too expensive for the old water treatment facilities, mainly in small towns and medium-sized cities or old cities that aren't growing, to force them to upgrade to just incredibly expensive systems that they couldn't pay for, but then mainly foreign companies then come in and offer
[02:09:49.894 --> 02:09:50.975]  We must have racist thinking, huh?
[02:10:19.158 --> 02:10:19.878]  Well, yeah.
[02:10:19.878 --> 02:10:23.081]  I mean, if you question anything, it's racist.
[02:10:23.081 --> 02:10:26.543]  And it's politically incorrect, and you should just do what you're told.
[02:10:26.543 --> 02:10:27.584]  God bless you, Alex.
[02:10:27.584 --> 02:10:28.564]  Keep up the good work.
[02:10:28.564 --> 02:10:30.065]  God bless you for putting up with me.
[02:10:30.065 --> 02:10:32.187]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:10:32.187 --> 02:10:33.368]  Thank you, Weldon.
[02:10:33.368 --> 02:10:36.249]  We got a Weldon working here in the office.
[02:10:36.249 --> 02:10:43.294]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dale in Illinois on immigration.
[02:10:43.294 --> 02:10:44.255]  You're on the air, Dale.
[02:10:44.255 --> 02:10:46.977]  Thanks a lot for having me on, Alex.
[02:10:46.977 --> 02:10:47.237]  Thank you.
[02:10:49.071 --> 02:10:57.373]  Um, I live in the southern portion of Illinois about five hours away from Chicago, and I live near Amtrak station.
[02:10:57.373 --> 02:11:05.795]  And used to we would, you know, very rarely see big buses coming in, like Greyhound buses and commercial buses like that.
[02:11:05.795 --> 02:11:11.196]  But now it's like every day, we see buses coming in and going to the Amtrak station.
[02:11:11.196 --> 02:11:14.237]  And even the Amtrak station itself wants to put more cars on its rails.
[02:11:14.918 --> 02:11:29.322]  To go to Chicago to transport these illegal immigrants, and it's very obvious, because if you go to these Amtrak stations, it's full of people, you know, they're stagged, very few of them speak English, and it's just insane.
[02:11:29.322 --> 02:11:33.683]  Oh yeah, last year I took the family up in Esquire Magazine.
[02:11:34.625 --> 02:11:38.948]  Met me there, did a profile, so it's actually chronicled.
[02:11:38.948 --> 02:11:44.893]  Strangely enough, because I'd forgotten Esquire was coming to Austin, so I told the Esquire rider, we'll just come to the family vacation in Hot Springs.
[02:11:44.893 --> 02:11:48.336]  I want to just go hiking with the kids and stuff.
[02:11:48.336 --> 02:11:53.039]  And on the way up, we stopped at gas stations on I-35.
[02:11:53.039 --> 02:12:00.565]  And on the way back, and all I would see at gas stations would be like six, seven, eight, nine buses, and it was illegals on them.
[02:12:02.114 --> 02:12:04.715]  Because you could tell, but I talked to some of the folks.
[02:12:04.715 --> 02:12:10.197]  Nothing against them individually, but it's not 60 or 70,000 kids have come in the last few months.
[02:12:10.197 --> 02:12:12.277]  Remember, they're only 17% of the numbers.
[02:12:12.277 --> 02:12:15.178]  The Border Patrol says it's millions.
[02:12:15.178 --> 02:12:31.364]  They have opened up Central and South America, and again, I went down to the hike and bike trail about three weeks ago and was down on Barton Creek, and there were illegals, because I went and talked to them, from Guatemala.
[02:12:32.605 --> 02:12:47.832]  And they were so pitiful and poor and fishing, trying to eat, that I shot a little bit of video on my phone, but never even put it out, because it's just like, it was like this old lady and a man and a woman and like five kids, but I'm like, what is the government doing?
[02:12:47.832 --> 02:12:51.574]  I mean, this is crazy!
[02:12:51.574 --> 02:12:54.155]  I mean, South and Central America are collapsing.
[02:12:54.155 --> 02:12:56.436]  Mexico is collapsing.
[02:12:56.436 --> 02:12:58.557]  And the government is going to collapse us with it.
[02:13:02.227 --> 02:13:03.508]  I can't believe it.
[02:13:03.508 --> 02:13:07.111]  It's gotta be like three million a month or something.
[02:13:07.111 --> 02:13:09.152]  I mean, it's just like everywhere.
[02:13:09.152 --> 02:13:15.457]  I drive by Home Depot and there used to be five or six day workers out there at any one time wanting jobs.
[02:13:15.457 --> 02:13:16.478]  I mean, it's like a hundred.
[02:13:16.478 --> 02:13:18.859]  Be able to send the camera crew over there.
[02:13:18.859 --> 02:13:27.786]  I drive by there like at 10 o'clock in the morning and it is just wall to wall just on the side of the road off their property.
[02:13:32.125 --> 02:13:34.185]  It's just insane.
[02:13:34.185 --> 02:13:35.466]  And it's checkmate is what it is.
[02:13:35.466 --> 02:13:46.868]  You know, the Koch brothers are now going to give money to give the illegals medical care, clinic care, and English classes.
[02:13:46.868 --> 02:13:49.989]  And I'm not a big fan of the Koch brothers funding Clinton and other things.
[02:13:49.989 --> 02:13:54.070]  I'm always accused of being funded by them because I'm not a communist, but I wish I'd get some of that money.
[02:13:54.070 --> 02:13:54.990]  I'd tell you if I was.
[02:13:54.990 --> 02:13:58.431]  Boy, it would be great, and I'd have to sit there and plug products all day to fund the operation.
[02:14:01.118 --> 02:14:02.059]  There's a new initiative out.
[02:14:02.059 --> 02:14:03.340]  In fact, it's in the printer.
[02:14:03.340 --> 02:14:03.920]  Somebody give me that.
[02:14:03.920 --> 02:14:05.681]  I printed it about 30 minutes ago.
[02:14:05.681 --> 02:14:07.103]  Thanks.
[02:14:07.103 --> 02:14:12.587]  Where they're going to get a little card to the illegals so they can get some stuff from the free market.
[02:14:12.587 --> 02:14:19.032]  That's not going to ever stand up to the Democrats with all the free school and the free have the babies and the free welfare.
[02:14:19.032 --> 02:14:21.093]  They'll just give them even more goodies.
[02:14:21.093 --> 02:14:24.436]  And then it's like an arms race or something.
[02:14:24.436 --> 02:14:25.096]  Now here it is.
[02:14:25.096 --> 02:14:27.138]  Koch brothers reach out to Hispanics
[02:14:29.338 --> 02:14:37.342]  And then the article goes through, and Greg Abbott's involved and a bunch of other people in Texas, that this will supposedly fix it.
[02:14:37.342 --> 02:14:39.743]  It's from the Associated Press.
[02:14:39.743 --> 02:14:47.907]  How is giving the illegals more freebies than to make them then like the Republicans and like the Koch brothers?
[02:14:47.907 --> 02:14:52.970]  That'll just create an arms race of goodies, and the entire world will just come here.
[02:14:52.970 --> 02:14:58.813]  I mean, it's like there's no way to get around this, is there?
[02:15:02.199 --> 02:15:06.102]  And they will vote to take the guns and to do whatever the Democrats say.
[02:15:06.102 --> 02:15:20.593]  It's not that these Central and South Americans and Mexicans even have the same values as the technocrat, overlord, science fiction nightmare globalists that run the Democrats and Republicans.
[02:15:20.593 --> 02:15:26.297]  I mean, it's a breakaway civilization of technocrats using supercomputers to war game everything.
[02:15:26.297 --> 02:15:27.538]  They're using tribalism.
[02:15:29.090 --> 02:15:33.333]  With big welfare classes that'll riot at the drop of a hat.
[02:15:33.333 --> 02:15:39.578]  Then they create a big police force to control them, which is really aimed at the producers, the middle class that's left.
[02:15:39.578 --> 02:15:41.439]  The robots are going to cut us out of everything.
[02:15:41.439 --> 02:15:45.503]  I mean, it's checkmate, folks, if we don't get involved now.
[02:15:45.503 --> 02:15:53.389]  I just can't believe that we've allowed a technocratic system to get control of our wealth and build this thing.
[02:15:53.389 --> 02:15:54.870]  And now they're just flooding everything.
[02:15:57.836 --> 02:16:05.698]  With refugees in the third world.
[02:16:05.698 --> 02:16:10.159]  And then you see what they do in stable countries like Libya or Iraq.
[02:16:10.159 --> 02:16:16.561]  They blow them up and bring in radicals to chop all the Christians' heads off.
[02:16:16.561 --> 02:16:21.122]  I guess it really is the devil.
[02:16:21.122 --> 02:16:24.442]  Because, I mean, only the mind of El Diablo could come up with this.
[02:16:24.442 --> 02:16:26.383]  Dale in Illinois, anything else?
[02:16:28.211 --> 02:16:38.655]  I mean, anyone that's ever been to Chicago will know that it's a cesspool of violence and drugs and gangs, and this isn't helping out at all.
[02:16:38.655 --> 02:16:40.436]  And even our state is in debt.
[02:16:40.436 --> 02:16:43.157]  It's in a lot of trouble.
[02:16:43.157 --> 02:16:44.098]  Oh, you're in total debt.
[02:16:44.098 --> 02:16:45.838]  You've been maneuvered into that position.
[02:16:45.838 --> 02:16:47.079]  Appreciate the call.
[02:16:47.967 --> 02:16:49.447]  We're not being negative here.
[02:16:49.447 --> 02:16:51.008]  This is where it's going.
[02:16:51.008 --> 02:17:04.071]  The plan is to wreck everything and implode everything but central city areas that'll be super fancy and nice for the elite to live, and then rural areas like Whitefish, where the elite will control everything.
[02:17:04.071 --> 02:17:06.192]  You'll go through checkpoints to get into it.
[02:17:06.192 --> 02:17:09.113]  Everyone else will live in hell.
[02:17:09.113 --> 02:17:14.794]  That's the public, cloward and pivot, Agenda 21 plan in Congress.
[02:17:14.794 --> 02:17:16.935]  Jay in Iowa, thanks for holding your ear on the air.
[02:17:18.834 --> 02:17:23.417]  Yeah, I just wanted to say something, uh, related to the veterinarian that called earlier.
[02:17:23.417 --> 02:17:31.242]  Uh, I got, uh, well, I stepped on a nail on a job site in, in 2004.
[02:17:31.242 --> 02:17:34.304]  I lived in Michigan at the time.
[02:17:34.304 --> 02:17:41.569]  Uh, the funny thing was, was I was just doing what I was told and I went and got a tetanus shot.
[02:17:41.569 --> 02:17:46.852]  And so anyway, a month later I ended up with chicken pox, something fierce.
[02:17:46.852 --> 02:17:47.552]  I was 28 at the time.
[02:17:49.071 --> 02:17:51.192]  It almost killed me.
[02:17:51.192 --> 02:17:55.434]  And I gave the chicken pox to a good friend of mine that was like four years older than me.
[02:17:55.434 --> 02:17:56.134]  Yeah, that's the thing.
[02:17:56.134 --> 02:17:59.616]  They make these vaccines in the same tanks they make other stuff.
[02:17:59.616 --> 02:18:02.697]  It's one of the biggest problems.
[02:18:02.697 --> 02:18:04.498]  Yeah.
[02:18:04.498 --> 02:18:07.160]  Lovely, huh?
[02:18:07.160 --> 02:18:10.421]  Yeah, I mean, you heard her, how it kills the dogs.
[02:18:10.421 --> 02:18:12.262]  And the Hollywood folks won't give it to them.
[02:18:12.262 --> 02:18:18.505]  They get expensive titer tests or immunity antibody tests.
[02:18:19.611 --> 02:18:19.892]  Right.
[02:18:19.892 --> 02:18:20.012]  Right.
[02:18:41.976 --> 02:18:46.960]  Uh, have got an autoimmune disorder or brain disorder or a muscular disorder.
[02:18:46.960 --> 02:18:48.882]  And soon it'll be half and then it'll be almost all.
[02:18:48.882 --> 02:18:51.484]  And we're just gonna have everybody dying around us.
[02:18:51.484 --> 02:18:54.426]  And if the answer is just take more shots, just believe the government.
[02:18:54.426 --> 02:19:01.272]  You see what I'm... So, I mean, did they directly link the tetanus shot to giving you the chicken pox?
[02:19:02.478 --> 02:19:09.803]  No, and I haven't really done any of my own research on it, but it was just odd that I'd never had the chickenpox before.
[02:19:09.803 --> 02:19:17.649]  Obviously, I was pretty immune to it, and then all of a sudden, I mean, I'd never felt like that before in my life.
[02:19:17.649 --> 02:19:19.771]  Yeah, well, tetanus does lower it.
[02:19:19.771 --> 02:19:21.812]  Here's the deal, and I want to get into the science of it.
[02:19:21.812 --> 02:19:22.993]  I've had medical doctors on.
[02:19:22.993 --> 02:19:26.796]  The UN's been caught in Latin America, Africa, and Asia.
[02:19:28.889 --> 02:19:39.157]  Adding a certain female hormone, forget the name of it, to the tetanus shot so it causes an autoimmune response to the tetanus shot and basically sterilizes the woman.
[02:19:39.157 --> 02:19:47.203]  But it also then fries the ovaries and uterus and the women usually have all these different type of cysts and other disorders that come out of it.
[02:19:47.203 --> 02:19:52.247]  And they like it because it's a nice soft kill gift that ends up killing a lot of third world women.
[02:19:52.247 --> 02:19:54.689]  Then those that survive, they just flood us with them.
[02:19:54.689 --> 02:19:56.791]  They don't know any better and they vote to make me their slave.
[02:19:56.791 --> 02:19:58.472]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[02:19:59.861 --> 02:20:02.843]  Do you owe the IRS money that you can't pay?
[02:20:02.843 --> 02:20:05.826]  Are tax liens and levies ruining your life?
[02:20:05.826 --> 02:20:09.248]  Are you tired of being afraid just to go to the mailbox?
[02:20:09.248 --> 02:20:12.851]  If this describes you, then Dan Pilla can help.

[02:20:59.502 --> 02:21:06.724]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:21:06.724 --> 02:21:09.085]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:21:09.085 --> 02:21:14.387]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:21:14.387 --> 02:21:19.569]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:21:19.569 --> 02:21:22.650]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:21:22.970 --> 02:21:27.052]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:21:27.052 --> 02:21:31.433]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:21:31.433 --> 02:21:41.718]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.

[02:22:07.194 --> 02:22:10.777]  Those we should be able to depend on let us down.
[02:22:10.777 --> 02:22:17.184]  Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way while the folks here in Bell Harbor say show me.
[02:22:17.184 --> 02:22:19.706]  Don't depend on the government to save you.

[02:23:40.390 --> 02:23:42.091]  I really love this Magic Mud product.
[02:23:42.091 --> 02:23:48.214]  Because charcoal is so absorbent, it's very effective at taking off all the sticky plaque and debris that gets stuck on our teeth every day.
[02:23:48.214 --> 02:23:49.774]  I highly recommend My Magic Mud.

[02:24:15.808 --> 02:24:18.229]  Don't want no shackles on me.
[02:24:18.229 --> 02:24:20.870]  Alright folks, Alex Jones here back live.
[02:24:20.870 --> 02:24:26.092]  Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are the news websites.
[02:24:26.092 --> 02:24:31.954]  We're going to hit some of that news in the next segment, talk to a guest, and get to the callers that are holding.
[02:24:31.954 --> 02:24:34.895]  There are two articles that caught my eye today.
[02:24:34.895 --> 02:24:39.297]  One of them is in the Daily Mail, the other is in CBS News out of Charlotte.
[02:24:40.888 --> 02:24:41.509]  Report!
[02:24:41.509 --> 02:24:45.992]  Robots will take over more jobs than they create.
[02:24:45.992 --> 02:24:57.121]  And this is a new Pew Research 1,800 industry experts by the Pew Research Internet Project and the Elan University Imaging the Internet Center.
[02:24:59.464 --> 02:25:13.428]  And a large percentage, 48%, have direct fears that the role of artificial workers will be unstoppable and that humans will not be able to adjust in time to avoid massive unemployment and social disruption.
[02:25:13.428 --> 02:25:15.088]  Here is another one.
[02:25:15.088 --> 02:25:21.430]  IBM develops a computer chip with one million neurons that functions like a human brain.
[02:25:22.486 --> 02:25:28.929]  IBM has developed a computer chip which it says will function like a human brain and a giant step forward for artificial intelligence.
[02:25:28.929 --> 02:25:36.713]  True North is being hailed as the world's first neuro-synaptic computer chip because it can figure things out on its own.
[02:25:36.713 --> 02:25:46.418]  The chip also has one million neurons and could cram the same power as a supercomputer into the circuit the size of a postage stamp.
[02:25:46.418 --> 02:25:47.359]  Now, let's talk about that.
[02:25:49.229 --> 02:25:57.271]  It's a very complex issue, obviously, but here's an example of technology innovating things and being good.
[02:25:57.271 --> 02:25:58.851]  Uber started four or five years ago.
[02:25:58.851 --> 02:26:00.292]  I want to do a whole report on it this week.
[02:26:00.292 --> 02:26:03.272]  We're going to get on that and get it done.
[02:26:03.272 --> 02:26:07.993]  Where you can use an app and you can, you only order it when you want it.
[02:26:07.993 --> 02:26:12.054]  And the Uber cab shows up on average in about five minutes in major cities.
[02:26:12.054 --> 02:26:15.875]  And I found it's a better experience than the average cab.
[02:26:15.875 --> 02:26:18.656]  Now, some cities are smart and the cabs opt into it.
[02:26:19.787 --> 02:26:22.049]  Other cities are trying to ban it.
[02:26:22.049 --> 02:26:28.153]  These associations of cabbies, because they want to run their same old system instead of adapting to it.
[02:26:28.153 --> 02:26:33.316]  And governments don't like it, because they can't tax it and can't control it, and they're trying to block it.
[02:26:33.316 --> 02:26:40.841]  So, of course, it's an innovation, or a nice black car comes and gets you.
[02:26:40.841 --> 02:26:47.246]  It's all set and computerized, the meter, and you can give them a tip on the computer if you want, on your smartphone.
[02:26:49.264 --> 02:26:55.346]  That's an example of an innovation, a renaissance by freeing things up and smashing monopolies.
[02:26:55.346 --> 02:26:58.547]  And of course, the power structure's trying to block it.
[02:26:58.547 --> 02:27:09.970]  On the other side, you've got Google coming in with their driverless cars and others, where they're already arguing, oh, it's safer than humans, even though they're having wrecks all the time and driving the wrong side down the road.
[02:27:11.605 --> 02:27:26.557]  And these things will be used by the insurance companies, always said will be, now they're doing it, to say, we need new systems on your car that take control when you're driving bad, or track what you've done, or instantly report back wirelessly to the police.
[02:27:26.557 --> 02:27:32.261]  No, we shouldn't, as consumers, allow products that surveil us with a predatory system.
[02:27:32.261 --> 02:27:39.367]  We, with our buying habits, should say no to those products before it becomes mandatory, which they're already trying to push.
[02:27:40.777 --> 02:27:48.562]  Smart meters, I told you 15 years ago, would control the temperature in your house, would game the algorithms and increase your prices.
[02:27:48.562 --> 02:27:53.305]  Now they've been caught from Austin, Texas to San Francisco, California doing it.
[02:27:53.305 --> 02:27:59.728]  It's not that a smart meter, it would be bad, it's that a bad system gave you the Trojan horse.
[02:27:59.728 --> 02:28:04.211]  People who have bad will built it.
[02:28:04.211 --> 02:28:05.612]  It's very simple.
[02:28:05.612 --> 02:28:06.633]  It's like if you had a renter
[02:28:07.645 --> 02:28:09.166]  Renting a room from you.
[02:28:09.166 --> 02:28:15.249]  You don't want to rent it to a person that's got 14 convictions.
[02:28:15.249 --> 02:28:20.132]  You don't want to open the door to Count Dracula with big fangs when he asks to come in.
[02:28:20.132 --> 02:28:22.373]  This is a bad New World Order.
[02:28:22.373 --> 02:28:33.139]  So basically, anything they give us may have some good applications, but it's Trojan horse run and has back doors, and there's a reason they gave it to us that isn't good in the big equation.
[02:28:34.295 --> 02:28:35.256]  Can we hack it?
[02:28:35.256 --> 02:28:36.537]  Can we jailbreak it?
[02:28:36.537 --> 02:28:40.740]  Can we end up using these little devil phones for good things?
[02:28:40.740 --> 02:28:46.104]  Can I shoot a YouTube video on it or a live feed and expose the police state with it?
[02:28:46.104 --> 02:28:51.849]  Yeah, but in the next version, they now hit a button where smartphone apps don't work.
[02:28:51.849 --> 02:28:55.652]  I happen to be downtown.
[02:28:55.652 --> 02:29:02.157]  Last week, when they had a Palestinian Gaza demonstration of about a thousand people,
[02:29:02.847 --> 02:29:06.611]  And I walked out of a restaurant to go film it and to do a live feed, and guess what?
[02:29:06.611 --> 02:29:08.152]  My phone would not work.
[02:29:08.152 --> 02:29:09.273]  I had a friend with me.
[02:29:09.273 --> 02:29:13.718]  Their Apple iPhone as well would not live stream and would not upload.
[02:29:13.718 --> 02:29:16.881]  And I saw Austin Cops on rooftops.
[02:29:16.881 --> 02:29:17.942]  I don't need to check.
[02:29:17.942 --> 02:29:20.024]  I know.
[02:29:20.024 --> 02:29:23.207]  They were with the feds testing a jamming system.
[02:29:23.207 --> 02:29:24.729]  And I went home and googled it.
[02:29:25.879 --> 02:29:39.013]  Sure enough, they're using jamming systems all over the country and they have the patents and it's already gone into the new Apples and Droids to hit one button at the Threat Fusion Center and disable phones in certain grids.
[02:29:39.013 --> 02:29:41.276]  So you're now going to have to buy a vintage camera
[02:29:42.945 --> 02:29:49.492]  Just like all the new cameras have GPS already built into them, even $200 cameras, that's actually a chip to turn your phone off, your camera off.
[02:29:49.492 --> 02:29:50.473]  See folks?
[02:29:50.473 --> 02:29:53.956]  This is a premeditated evil takeover.
[02:29:53.956 --> 02:29:55.718]  It's incredible.
[02:29:55.718 --> 02:29:58.961]  Now you go to a concert and they turn your phone off.
[02:30:01.044 --> 02:30:02.405]  In the near future.
[02:30:02.405 --> 02:30:06.066]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[02:30:06.066 --> 02:30:06.887]  Security alert.
[02:30:06.887 --> 02:30:08.107]  Security alert.
[02:30:08.107 --> 02:30:10.108]  This is Homeland Security.
[02:30:10.108 --> 02:30:10.989]  Analysis.
[02:30:10.989 --> 02:30:11.729]  InfoWars.
[02:30:11.729 --> 02:30:13.690]  Building independent media operations.
[02:30:13.690 --> 02:30:18.713]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[02:30:18.713 --> 02:30:19.733]  Crime Directive.
[02:30:19.733 --> 02:30:21.274]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[02:30:21.274 --> 02:30:24.135]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[02:30:24.135 --> 02:30:27.377]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[02:30:27.377 --> 02:30:29.558]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[02:30:29.878 --> 02:30:31.199]  People are assaulting us.
[02:30:31.199 --> 02:30:34.041]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[02:30:34.041 --> 02:30:35.982]  They are never going to stop.
[02:30:35.982 --> 02:30:40.004]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[02:30:40.004 --> 02:30:43.586]  Block free iPhone apps at Infowars.com.
[02:30:43.586 --> 02:30:46.969]  Block free podcast and video feed.
[02:30:46.969 --> 02:30:47.969]  Imperative.
[02:30:47.969 --> 02:30:49.930]  Destroy Britain's Planet TV.
[02:30:49.930 --> 02:30:54.473]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[02:30:54.473 --> 02:30:56.815]  Intellectually, it's begun and you can feel it.
[02:31:00.307 --> 02:31:07.593]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset, where we are proud of our 100% grown and sewn American-made jeans.
[02:31:07.593 --> 02:31:15.498]  Whether you're out for dinner, working on the farm, or on the road, Diamond Gusset Jeans offers a full spectrum of style and sizes for any occasion.

[02:31:26.406 --> 02:31:29.328]  In Liberty, David Hall, Diamond Gusset Jeans Company.
[02:31:29.795 --> 02:31:33.457]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:31:33.457 --> 02:31:37.740]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:31:37.740 --> 02:31:39.521]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:31:39.521 --> 02:31:44.845]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.
[02:31:44.845 --> 02:31:47.386]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal.
[02:31:47.386 --> 02:31:48.527]  But for how long?
[02:31:48.527 --> 02:31:55.171]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[02:31:55.171 --> 02:31:57.973]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[02:31:59.574 --> 02:32:03.396]  City of Austin tap water versus filtered City of Austin tap water.
[02:32:03.396 --> 02:32:04.636]  I didn't, I taste dirt in it.
[02:32:04.636 --> 02:32:05.957]  God knows what's in this.
[02:32:05.957 --> 02:32:10.219]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[02:32:10.219 --> 02:32:16.021]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered with a ProPure G2.0 filtration system.
[02:32:16.021 --> 02:32:17.062]  That one is better.
[02:32:17.142 --> 02:32:18.422]  It tastes like nothing.
[02:32:18.422 --> 02:32:19.863]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like.
[02:32:19.863 --> 02:32:20.503]  It's good water.
[02:32:20.503 --> 02:32:26.485]  Most tap water contains added substances, like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others.
[02:32:26.485 --> 02:32:33.707]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lowered IQ, and even cancer.
[02:32:33.707 --> 02:32:36.428]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're drinking tap water.
[02:32:36.428 --> 02:32:44.351]  The ProPure® G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh-tasting, deliciously clean water.
[02:32:44.471 --> 02:32:45.493]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[02:32:45.493 --> 02:32:46.695]  It's good water.
[02:32:46.695 --> 02:32:47.296]  Refreshing.
[02:32:47.296 --> 02:32:47.917]  It's good!

[02:33:28.291 --> 02:33:34.774]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:33:34.774 --> 02:33:41.817]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:33:41.817 --> 02:33:50.201]  Mike listening on 1340 AM in California.
[02:33:50.201 --> 02:33:52.903]  We're gonna get to you.
[02:33:52.903 --> 02:33:53.363]  Michael?
[02:33:54.571 --> 02:33:56.252]  Listening via the internet in North Carolina.
[02:33:56.252 --> 02:33:57.753]  We're going to get to you.
[02:33:57.753 --> 02:33:58.934]  Dennis in Minnesota.
[02:33:58.934 --> 02:34:01.636]  JT in Missouri.
[02:34:01.636 --> 02:34:02.216]  Ben and others.
[02:34:02.216 --> 02:34:05.238]  We're going to talk to all of you here.
[02:34:05.238 --> 02:34:09.201]  Right now we are joined by the man known as Lionel.
[02:34:10.402 --> 02:34:16.365]  And he has a show on mainline broadcast television in New York City.
[02:34:16.365 --> 02:34:19.026]  Syndicated radio host as well.
[02:34:19.026 --> 02:34:24.889]  I met him back when he introduced me a few years ago to the keynote speech I gave to Talkers magazine in New York.
[02:34:25.956 --> 02:34:40.081]  And he is a former prosecutor, he's a lawyer, news decoder, and First Amendment sentry, and a New York-based television legal analyst, LionelMedia.com, and his Twitter is LionelMedia as well.
[02:34:40.081 --> 02:34:49.024]  The reason I want to get him on is not, oh my gosh, Keith Oberman talked about us, because who cares?
[02:34:49.963 --> 02:35:00.149]  And I bullhorned Keith Overman at the DNC in 2008, and shut down the show before it, Hardball and his, for two hours, and they went into conniption fits of anger.
[02:35:00.149 --> 02:35:14.737]  I mean, you know, the guys on ESPN, which is there again to make the only hero of sports figures, and is its own form of propaganda where they suspend people who admit that five years ago their girlfriend hit them, so they hit them back.
[02:35:14.737 --> 02:35:16.678]  You know, just incredible political correctness.
[02:35:17.708 --> 02:35:28.253]  I'm not saying it's good to hit your girlfriend when they hit you, but the point is, is that, you know, if Al Qaeda wants to chop off a couple hundred thousand Christians' heads, and our government gives them the weapons, that's okay.
[02:35:28.253 --> 02:35:32.535]  And if a race car driver wants to run somebody over in front of everybody, that's okay.
[02:35:32.535 --> 02:35:37.497]  But my God, you tell the truth about it, you slap your girlfriend back, you're going to lose your job.
[02:35:37.497 --> 02:35:43.160]  I don't mean to go off on a jag here, it's just that's political correctness.
[02:35:43.160 --> 02:35:45.101]  A.K.A.
[02:35:45.101 --> 02:35:46.262]  mind control, A.K.A.
[02:35:47.941 --> 02:36:06.134]  Apocalypse Now, where Colonel Kurtz says, we train our pilots to drop fire on villages, killing men, women, and children, but we court-martial them when they write cuss words on the sides of their airplanes.
[02:36:06.134 --> 02:36:08.355]  It's a sick joke, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:36:08.355 --> 02:36:12.298]  It's the symbols over the substance.
[02:36:12.298 --> 02:36:16.001]  But Keith Oberman and a bunch of other Democrats now,
[02:36:17.327 --> 02:36:30.976]  have been on a jag against InfoWars.com, DrugsReport.com, and Keith Overman also attacked... I had to sneeze there.
[02:36:30.976 --> 02:36:37.259]  Keith Overman also attacked Lionel.
[02:36:37.259 --> 02:36:42.563]  And, you know, the funny part about a lot of these attacks now is they don't even say what we said that was a lie or wrong.
[02:36:42.563 --> 02:36:44.384]  They just say, well here it is.
[02:36:48.243 --> 02:36:56.006]  Laugh out loud, perfect trilogy of paranoia, sophistry, and tinfoil ass-hattery.
[02:36:56.006 --> 02:36:57.906]  Talk about sophistry.
[02:36:57.906 --> 02:37:06.389]  I mean, just saying tinfoil hat that's in a CIA memo from 1963, that you say, conspiracy theory, tinfoil hat.
[02:37:06.389 --> 02:37:08.770]  I mean, that's declassified.
[02:37:08.770 --> 02:37:14.072]  That in 1963, the CIA, right after they killed Kennedy, put out these talking points.
[02:37:15.592 --> 02:37:16.993]  It was only declassified a few years ago.
[02:37:16.993 --> 02:37:19.215]  Paul Watson wrote an article about it.
[02:37:19.215 --> 02:37:20.377]  And that's their response.
[02:37:20.377 --> 02:37:22.939]  Hey, Obama's putting our military under NATO command!
[02:37:22.939 --> 02:37:25.601]  Did you see the Senate hearings?
[02:37:25.601 --> 02:37:26.843]  Ass-hattery!
[02:37:26.843 --> 02:37:27.623]  Hey, did you hear?
[02:37:27.623 --> 02:37:30.426]  A lot of the studies show that fluoride's causing brain damage.
[02:37:30.426 --> 02:37:31.107]  A new Harvard study.
[02:37:32.315 --> 02:37:33.996]  Tinfoil Hattery!
[02:37:33.996 --> 02:37:39.060]  Hey, did you hear Obamacare doubles the prices, triples the prices, and really does have death panels in it?
[02:37:39.060 --> 02:37:43.943]  The guy that authored it, Rahm Emanuel's brother, said it on Fox News.
[02:37:43.943 --> 02:37:48.186]  Tinfoil hat, full moon!
[02:37:48.186 --> 02:37:50.528]  So, I mean, what happened to Keith Olbermann?
[02:37:50.528 --> 02:37:57.432]  This is a guy that talked about the Downing Street memo when it was leaked, where Bush wanted to stage terror attacks to blame it on
[02:37:59.344 --> 02:38:01.607]  Saddam, so they could invade.
[02:38:01.607 --> 02:38:09.895]  I mean, the thing is, Keith Olbermann's actually smart, folks, but since the Democrats are in, he will sit there and defend them to the hilt.
[02:38:09.895 --> 02:38:13.199]  I mean, Republicans get in power, folks, and they start doing stuff, I'll go out against them.
[02:38:15.530 --> 02:38:16.911]  Joining us is Lionel.
[02:38:16.911 --> 02:38:23.516]  Lionel, you did a pretty good breakdown of this on the Nightly News last week, so I wanted to get you on and talk about it here on the radio.
[02:38:23.516 --> 02:38:24.836]  It's not just Keith Boverman, though.
[02:38:24.836 --> 02:38:27.278]  I mean, I'm getting attacked every day.
[02:38:27.278 --> 02:38:29.400]  Drudge is getting attacked 50 times a day.
[02:38:29.400 --> 02:38:31.701]  You're getting attacked now every week.
[02:38:31.701 --> 02:38:35.624]  I mean, do they think we care that they're attacking us?
[02:38:35.624 --> 02:38:35.724]  No.
[02:38:36.223 --> 02:38:41.067]  What happens is, it's a weird Alex, it's a weird Pavlovian-Patella reflex on their part.
[02:38:41.067 --> 02:38:47.273]  And what's interesting is that, there's an old expression, you only know you're over the target when you catch fire, or when you take fire.
[02:38:47.273 --> 02:38:52.698]  And by the way, as I sometimes jokingly respond, it's not tinfoil, it's aluminum foil.
[02:38:52.698 --> 02:38:55.561]  Everybody knows we haven't used tinfoil in years.
[02:38:55.561 --> 02:38:58.143]  But let me say a couple of things that's interesting here, Alex.
[02:38:58.143 --> 02:38:58.844]  First and foremost,
[02:39:00.435 --> 02:39:03.636]  Every day, you must start off your day.
[02:39:03.636 --> 02:39:12.740]  I can imagine saying, I don't have enough time in the day to go through and cover the panoply of stories that are so critical.
[02:39:12.740 --> 02:39:29.208]  Yet, around the country, I guarantee you, newsrooms from mainstream media, from the Ted Baxter, Ron Burgundy, Echo Chamber, Cookie Cutter, ass-hattery newsrooms are saying, well, it's a slow news day today.
[02:39:29.748 --> 02:39:46.395]  Now what's interesting to note about this is that what I find interesting is it's not Alex the government per se who is the main stiflers of free speech and those individuals who want to quell and quash a truth.
[02:39:46.395 --> 02:39:54.678]  It's individuals who basically are not Alex, I call them not the thought police, but the thought vigilantes.
[02:39:54.678 --> 02:39:59.360]  A bunch of self-appointed guardians of what they consider
[02:39:59.360 --> 02:40:01.400]  And I think Alex one of the biggest motivators of this dissent
[02:40:20.345 --> 02:40:20.665]  I don't know.
[02:40:38.018 --> 02:40:58.845]  What I was amazed by is that C-SPAN, which is certainly not left, right-wing, very reputable, for the first time really is, I think, seriously broaching the subject of not even 9-11 truth per se, but the physical evidence as to the official story of 9-11.
[02:40:58.845 --> 02:41:03.727]  Not who was responsible, who was behind, inside job, none of that.
[02:41:03.727 --> 02:41:04.847]  And that
[02:41:06.067 --> 02:41:14.692]  That percolating through, breaking this logical cap, so to speak, has done more to freak people out.
[02:41:14.692 --> 02:41:18.695]  Because Alex, what you're doing is, you're unsettling them.
[02:41:18.695 --> 02:41:25.699]  You're saying to them, A, they don't know what they think they know, and B, they're not being told the truth.
[02:41:25.699 --> 02:41:31.943]  You know, I was talking to friends of mine in the news media, never going to mention their names, we're talking about
[02:41:32.743 --> 02:41:41.212]  Absolutely at the top of the heap, so to speak, in terms of this pedigree of news reportage.
[02:41:41.212 --> 02:41:49.660]  And they're looking at ISIS merely in an observational mode, and I'm asking them, well, who do you think is behind it?
[02:41:49.660 --> 02:41:50.721]  What do you mean?
[02:41:50.721 --> 02:41:52.223]  Who is behind ISIS?
[02:41:52.643 --> 02:41:53.744]  What is the reason?
[02:41:53.744 --> 02:41:58.187]  And let me guess, just asking who's behind it is a conspiracy.
[02:41:58.187 --> 02:42:01.610]  They've now made critical thinking a mental illness.
[02:42:01.610 --> 02:42:06.154]  They've now made being involved and knowing factoids bizarre.
[02:42:06.154 --> 02:42:10.357]  They've now made knowing more than them a thought crime.
[02:42:10.697 --> 02:42:11.918]  And I think you're right.
[02:42:11.918 --> 02:42:24.648]  It's more of the fact that they're so ignorant, they just use this as a crutch, because the world's getting scarier and scarier, they're losing more and more influence, we're gaining more and more influence, and they don't like it.
[02:42:24.648 --> 02:42:27.651]  Remember, the thought vigilantes!
[02:42:28.371 --> 02:42:29.973]  This is not the Thought Police.
[02:42:29.973 --> 02:42:38.841]  You know, Gore Vidal had three postulates, three theorems, if you will, hypotheses, that I think about every single day.
[02:42:38.841 --> 02:42:44.706]  Number one, he coined the idea, I'm not a conspiracy theorist, I'm a conspiracy analyst.
[02:42:44.706 --> 02:42:45.067]  That's right.
[02:42:45.487 --> 02:42:56.155]  He also said that there will come a day, by the way that day is now, where it is an article of fate to be an American to say that there are no conspiracy theories.
[02:42:56.155 --> 02:43:07.104]  And the third, most important of this troika of thought, if you will, is that conspiracy theory has become a code word for the unspeakable truth.
[02:43:07.104 --> 02:43:14.190]  You see, it's very interesting to note that when you hit Peter, and I will never understand, Alex, if you told me
[02:43:15.180 --> 02:43:25.724]  That I would be arguing with people, not as an anti-American or anti-Obama or anti-whatever, but I would be arguing to say, please let me tell you the truth.
[02:43:25.724 --> 02:43:34.507]  It'd be like going to a doctor and he wants to read to you the lab results or show you the x-ray and there's a very serious metastasis or something wrong and you're
[02:43:34.667 --> 02:43:35.848]  You're fighting him.
[02:43:35.848 --> 02:43:39.992]  You're fighting him on the accuracy of the measuring devices.
[02:43:39.992 --> 02:43:43.255]  You're talking about the state of American medicine.
[02:43:43.255 --> 02:43:49.802]  You're talking about leeches and you're using versions of tinfoil hat leeches and bloodletting and you're making fun of him.
[02:43:49.802 --> 02:43:52.124]  I've never seen people who run from the truth.
[02:43:52.124 --> 02:43:54.726]  There's also something here, Alex, which is very, very scary.
[02:43:55.587 --> 02:44:13.633]  Recently, based upon this meme, if you will, this habituation to control, again by the thought vigilantes, we're seeing more and more people on subscription radio, internet radio, sports, who opine.
[02:44:13.633 --> 02:44:15.194]  Maybe not say the best thing.
[02:44:15.194 --> 02:44:22.436]  Maybe somebody says something about domestic violence and you think, gee, that's kind of stupid, or that's kind of dumb, or I don't agree with that.
[02:44:22.436 --> 02:44:24.597]  And instead of people saying, well,
[02:44:25.057 --> 02:44:30.546]  I'm going to use this channel, it's called The Off Button, or I'm going to go someplace else, or who cares, or so what?
[02:44:30.546 --> 02:44:31.748]  They say no!
[02:44:31.748 --> 02:44:33.371]  I want him suspended!
[02:44:33.371 --> 02:44:34.472]  I don't want him fired!
[02:44:34.472 --> 02:44:37.317]  I want him fired because I disagree with this!
[02:44:37.317 --> 02:44:37.477]  Now!
[02:44:38.593 --> 02:44:52.417]  If you can start becoming more and more used to people being censured, censured rather, and censored for what they say voluntarily by the thought vigilantes, the meme is created.
[02:44:52.417 --> 02:45:03.420]  We are habituated and conditioned to the fact that speech does not have to be allowed, if it is offendable, or offensive I should say, to at least one person in a group.
[02:45:03.860 --> 02:45:04.440]  No, that's right.
[02:45:04.440 --> 02:45:10.583]  That's the whole hate crime model where guys that drag a black guy to death in Texas get the death penalty.
[02:45:10.583 --> 02:45:12.043]  But that's not enough.
[02:45:12.043 --> 02:45:16.225]  We need to pass a hate crime law so they can then apply it to speech.
[02:45:16.225 --> 02:45:19.686]  If anyone is hurt by it, now you can't have it.
[02:45:19.686 --> 02:45:24.348]  Well, my gosh, I mean, you can find anybody to be offended by anything.
[02:45:24.348 --> 02:45:26.168]  That's the end of the First Amendment.
[02:45:26.168 --> 02:45:32.591]  And also, you know, Alex, you understand this, but hate, the word hate,
[02:45:33.331 --> 02:45:35.272]  That is protected speech.
[02:45:35.272 --> 02:45:44.618]  Now, you can hate crime, and you can hate terrorism, and hate sin, and you can hate, and that's okay, you can hate certain Islamists all day long.
[02:45:44.618 --> 02:45:46.019]  But that is a protected speech.
[02:45:46.019 --> 02:45:52.223]  Now, when you take something which is a law, which is already cognizable at law, assault and or battery,
[02:45:53.226 --> 02:45:54.468]  That already exists.
[02:45:54.468 --> 02:45:59.654]  And you pair it with something that is an already protected speech.
[02:45:59.654 --> 02:46:01.216]  And you combine the two.
[02:46:01.216 --> 02:46:08.985]  And you penalize somebody and aggravate the sentence because they dared to utter an otherwise constitutionally protected speech.
[02:46:08.985 --> 02:46:10.507]  Then you have the hate crime.
[02:46:10.507 --> 02:46:12.389]  And what's also interesting is I love this.
[02:46:13.070 --> 02:46:25.575]  Alex, I used to hate people who said the professional left, the professional right, left and right, but I say it now almost out of a sense of, you know, shortcuts.
[02:46:25.575 --> 02:46:29.757]  But the people who rail against Israel,
[02:46:31.034 --> 02:46:36.037]  And I'm not going to get into an Israeli-Gaza-Hamas argument.
[02:46:36.037 --> 02:46:37.818]  By the way, they never mention Hamas.
[02:46:37.818 --> 02:46:40.039]  It's always Israel and that's it.
[02:46:40.039 --> 02:46:54.386]  But those individuals who dare to mention this, this overreaction, will think nothing if their beloved president wipes out a marriage party in Yemen with a drone missile, with a Hellfire missile.
[02:46:54.386 --> 02:46:56.107]  That's somehow different.
[02:46:56.107 --> 02:46:57.067]  And what amazes me
[02:46:58.408 --> 02:46:58.848]  No, no, no.
[02:46:58.848 --> 02:46:59.349]  There you go.
[02:46:59.349 --> 02:47:03.072]  That's what I'm sick of, is the whole debate is a fraud.
[02:47:03.072 --> 02:47:04.713]  None of it's even real.
[02:47:04.713 --> 02:47:08.817]  You got ISIS killing 300,000 people under their last name in Syria.
[02:47:09.961 --> 02:47:19.484]  And our government funding them, and then no one wants to talk about them killing Christians, non-radical Muslims, literally chopping babies' heads off.
[02:47:19.484 --> 02:47:23.246]  They just want to go, oh, you work for Israel because you don't want to blow Israel up.
[02:47:23.246 --> 02:47:31.149]  And I'm just going, wait a minute, I'm simply saying at least there's some fight going on with Israel and Hamas, and you know, it's tribal and both sides, it's never going to end.
[02:47:31.149 --> 02:47:32.069]  Boy, it's a tragedy.
[02:47:33.286 --> 02:47:34.806]  I want peace over there.
[02:47:34.806 --> 02:47:37.447]  No, I'm not allowed to have a reasonable position.
[02:47:37.447 --> 02:47:41.468]  I'm supposed to just say, murder all the Jews, or I'm a bad guy.
[02:47:41.468 --> 02:47:45.629]  Well, meanwhile, no one cares about Christians being murdered.
[02:47:45.629 --> 02:47:46.110]  Right.
[02:47:46.110 --> 02:47:53.472]  You know, you mentioned something in the guest you had on prior to me about the church and the First Amendment.
[02:47:53.472 --> 02:47:57.893]  You know, we get the Bill of Rights, Alex, whether you like them or not.
[02:47:57.893 --> 02:47:59.933]  We get the first and we get the second.
[02:47:59.933 --> 02:48:02.054]  The second is just as good as the rest of them.
[02:48:03.070 --> 02:48:08.612]  And America is under attack, yet again.
[02:48:08.612 --> 02:48:13.454]  Remember this, by the thought vigilantes.
[02:48:13.454 --> 02:48:17.415]  You see, I am not a spiritual person per se.
[02:48:17.415 --> 02:48:19.296]  I'm rather irreligious.
[02:48:19.296 --> 02:48:21.417]  I also don't speak French.
[02:48:21.417 --> 02:48:22.617]  So what?
[02:48:22.617 --> 02:48:26.939]  What I'm seeing right now is this systematic mocking.
[02:48:27.859 --> 02:48:30.922]  Bill Maher does it, and a variety of others.
[02:48:30.922 --> 02:48:34.604]  Remember, every faith looks silly if you don't understand it.
[02:48:34.604 --> 02:48:36.566]  Every language sounds funny if you don't understand it.
[02:48:36.566 --> 02:48:40.349]  They're attacking Christianity because they want the state to be God.
[02:48:40.349 --> 02:48:42.190]  They want to get rid of the old God.
[02:48:42.190 --> 02:48:50.676]  So even if you don't believe in the God of the Christians, the point is you better look at why they're trying to tear it down, because they got a brand new God.
[02:48:50.676 --> 02:48:53.619]  And let me tell you, I don't want to get on my knees to this one.
[02:48:54.119 --> 02:49:00.663]  Well, you know, I was raised, from kindergarten through high school, in Catholic school.
[02:49:00.663 --> 02:49:04.725]  And I have nothing but respect for the nuns and the priests that I had.
[02:49:04.725 --> 02:49:07.766]  I was never touched, or spanked, or hit, or anything.
[02:49:07.766 --> 02:49:10.548]  But yet, it's open season.
[02:49:10.548 --> 02:49:14.310]  And you have a bunch of people, too, who are the professional atheists.
[02:49:14.770 --> 02:49:22.456]  You know, somebody once said, if atheism is a religion, then not collecting stamps is a hobby.
[02:49:22.456 --> 02:49:37.928]  And what they do every year is around, in New York, right outside the Holland Tunnel, atheists will, again, citizens, not the government, the thought vigilantes, will mock, mock Christmas, mock the notion of Jesus.
[02:49:37.928 --> 02:49:42.372]  So I have said on television and many times throughout my career,
[02:49:43.132 --> 02:49:49.479]  Why don't you show the same type of contempt for other religions who happen to believe in the gods?
[02:49:49.479 --> 02:49:56.687]  Oh yeah, we never hear anything from the professional atheist when devil worshippers do something or when radical Muslims do something.
[02:49:56.687 --> 02:49:57.508]  Ramadan?
[02:49:57.508 --> 02:49:58.489]  They don't ever put any good...
[02:49:58.669 --> 02:50:01.811]  They would never do that, or make fun of... Exactly!
[02:50:01.811 --> 02:50:09.134]  Under political correctness, it's only okay to attack Christians, and then with the professional left, to attack Israel.
[02:50:09.134 --> 02:50:12.756]  And Israel's got its share of problems, and I've got a lot of problems with what Israel does.
[02:50:12.756 --> 02:50:17.138]  But it's just so vitriolic, and dumbed down is the issue.
[02:50:17.138 --> 02:50:19.959]  It's like these pseudo-intellectuals don't know anything.
[02:50:19.959 --> 02:50:24.622]  They just go, I can know how to read the New York Times, and I hate Israel.
[02:50:25.342 --> 02:50:27.964]  And so, therefore, I'm real smart!
[02:50:27.964 --> 02:50:30.447]  There is a kit that you get.
[02:50:30.447 --> 02:50:33.449]  It's a playbook that you get to be a part of this.
[02:50:33.449 --> 02:50:34.590]  It's your quiver.
[02:50:34.590 --> 02:50:35.431]  This is what you know.
[02:50:35.431 --> 02:50:36.672]  This is your ammunition.
[02:50:36.672 --> 02:50:39.374]  And you must swear fealty to the following.
[02:50:39.374 --> 02:50:47.482]  You know, Alex, I am and have been forever an absolute advocate of the Second Amendment.
[02:50:47.482 --> 02:50:48.943]  I was raised in Florida.
[02:50:48.943 --> 02:50:51.365]  We've had carry permits before anybody had them.
[02:50:51.485 --> 02:50:52.348]  I want to hear about this.
[02:50:52.348 --> 02:50:53.050]  I want to hear about this.
[02:50:53.050 --> 02:50:58.004]  People say Alex Jones has his right-wing script of guns and private property and family.
[02:50:58.004 --> 02:50:58.947]  Yeah, because I like it!
[02:51:00.129 --> 02:51:04.110]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[02:51:04.110 --> 02:51:08.431]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[02:51:08.431 --> 02:51:12.052]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[02:51:12.052 --> 02:51:15.093]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[02:51:15.093 --> 02:51:22.355]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[02:51:22.575 --> 02:51:26.478]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[02:51:26.478 --> 02:51:30.861]  You filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[02:51:30.861 --> 02:51:36.765]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[02:51:36.765 --> 02:51:40.807]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[02:51:40.807 --> 02:51:43.409]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[02:51:43.409 --> 02:51:44.910]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[02:51:44.910 --> 02:51:46.251]  It's time to take action.
[02:51:46.251 --> 02:51:47.912]  It's time to filter our water.
[02:51:48.072 --> 02:51:50.894]  When an emergency happens, you'll be left to fend for yourself and your family.
[02:51:50.894 --> 02:51:52.956]  An outbreak of contagious disease can happen anywhere.
[02:52:07.048 --> 02:52:09.870]  And the threat of bioterrorism is always at hand.
[02:52:09.870 --> 02:52:15.673]  Because we're faced with more diseases than ever before, we need a better solution than ever before.
[02:52:15.673 --> 02:52:19.615]  Fortunately, there's a simple, effective way to protect yourself.

[02:54:08.524 --> 02:54:19.194]  Remember folks warning you, the conspiracy theorists, that the NSA was tracking everything you did and using it to control the markets?
[02:54:19.194 --> 02:54:21.236]  All that's been leaked now and it's public.
[02:54:21.236 --> 02:54:25.620]  Of course, I had it directly from NSA whistleblowers and others back in 1996, 97, 98.
[02:54:25.620 --> 02:54:29.624]  I was one of the only people talking about it at the time.
[02:54:29.624 --> 02:54:32.447]  And the more I talked about it, the more whistleblowers gave me intel.
[02:54:33.752 --> 02:54:43.078]  So you go back to those shows where he explained hubs and all the major telecoms and exactly how it works, the name of the projects.
[02:54:43.078 --> 02:54:48.101]  And he had James Bamford on, the big former producer of Nightline, who exposed it.
[02:54:48.101 --> 02:54:49.122]  I had him on in 98.
[02:54:49.122 --> 02:54:58.908]  I'm not bragging, but people used to make fun of me and said, that's the guy that says the government listens to our phone calls.
[02:54:58.908 --> 02:55:01.790]  Now they've been caught, it's illegal, did they get in trouble?
[02:55:01.790 --> 02:55:01.910]  No.
[02:55:02.947 --> 02:55:14.992]  We're going to have a few minutes left with Lionel here in a moment, then I'm going to do 30 minutes of overdrive to talk to Michael and Mike and Denise and Curtis and Ben and others.
[02:55:14.992 --> 02:55:16.053]  I will get to all of you.
[02:55:16.053 --> 02:55:22.676]  And I also want to talk about one of the biggest forms of manipulation by the globalists and give you the latest on what's happening in Iraq.
[02:55:23.967 --> 02:55:30.032]  Very briefly, and some political correctness I haven't gotten to, but first I'll get those calls out of the way before Lionel gets a final comment.
[02:55:30.032 --> 02:55:45.883]  I want to officially invite Lionel back at least once a month on the show and I want to invite him now that his Skype is so incredibly clear to maybe co-host sometime for an hour or two with David Knight when he's sitting in and filling in because he is such an interesting fellow and I'd like to give him a chance to walk through some reports.
[02:55:46.964 --> 02:55:51.266]  Just please don't forget this hour is brought to you by MyPatriotSupply.com.

[02:56:21.794 --> 02:56:34.280]  And everything, I've never done a special like this, at InfoWarsStore.com, or when you call our toll-free number, is 10% off with the promo code 10.
[02:56:34.280 --> 02:56:37.582]  Now, you could say 11, you could say 9, but we don't follow
[02:56:39.534 --> 02:56:44.906]  We don't follow here on Air Common Core, so it has to be 1-0.
[02:56:44.906 --> 02:56:47.231]  Like 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[02:56:47.231 --> 02:56:48.173]  The promo code is 1-0.
[02:56:50.353 --> 02:56:50.834]  1-0.
[02:56:50.834 --> 02:57:05.726]  You'll get 10% off already everything discounted, whether it's high quality non-GMO seeds, whether it's my books and films, whether it's the InfoWars Life supplements like X2, Super Male Vitality, Super Female Vitality.
[02:57:05.726 --> 02:57:15.455]  That helps fund our operation and all the other great folks that come on the show, get magnified by our larger platform, and then hopefully they promote us right back for Synergy.
[02:57:16.415 --> 02:57:20.057]  Finishing up with LionelMedia.com's host, Lionel.
[02:57:20.057 --> 02:57:21.658]  Lionel, we've got about a minute and a half left.
[02:57:21.658 --> 02:57:22.419]  Closing comment.
[02:57:25.462 --> 02:57:28.283]  I am a believer in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights.
[02:57:28.283 --> 02:57:29.163]  I really have no choice.
[02:57:29.163 --> 02:57:29.843]  I'm an American.
[02:57:29.843 --> 02:57:30.904]  You're a terrorist.
[02:57:30.904 --> 02:57:31.364]  Yes.
[02:57:31.364 --> 02:57:40.266]  In addition to that, those individuals, or those rights that were given to me by our forebears, the Second Amendment is one that I believe in.
[02:57:40.266 --> 02:57:41.386]  I'm a native Floridian.
[02:57:41.386 --> 02:57:47.808]  I'm a second-generation cracker, which is, by the way, a term of art, and not anything racially pejorative.
[02:57:47.808 --> 02:57:50.069]  And we had carry permits before anybody else.
[02:57:50.729 --> 02:57:52.071]  And I never shot anybody.
[02:57:52.071 --> 02:57:53.553]  I've never been hunting in my life.
[02:57:53.553 --> 02:57:55.416]  Not that there's anything wrong with that.
[02:57:55.416 --> 02:58:05.230]  And yet, I'm called a right-wing lunatic because I prefer and have the unmitigated audacity in believing
[02:58:05.751 --> 02:58:11.675]  That I can implement any reasonable instrument of self-protection for me and my family.
[02:58:11.675 --> 02:58:25.243]  I am so deluded by this sense of autonomy, provided for in the Constitution, that somehow my gun is an extension of my hypo-menchilate maleness.
[02:58:25.243 --> 02:58:26.384]  And I'll leave it at that, because as a
[02:58:26.664 --> 02:58:31.448]  Meanwhile, government can have bunkers and armored vehicles and prepare for war against us.
[02:58:31.448 --> 02:58:37.652]  A bunch of cowards have the crutch of calling you an extremist because you're a man who has an instinct to protect his family.
[02:58:37.652 --> 02:58:38.953]  Lionel, thank you so much.
[02:58:38.953 --> 02:58:44.597]  We'll be back with your phone calls, more news, a lot of breaking news at InfoWars.com right now.
[02:58:44.597 --> 02:58:47.820]  And back on the nightly news tonight, 7 o'clock.
[02:58:47.820 --> 02:58:48.600]  I'll be part of that.
[02:58:48.600 --> 02:58:49.561]  7 o'clock Central.
[02:58:49.941 --> 02:58:57.105]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:58:57.105 --> 02:58:59.446]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:58:59.446 --> 02:59:04.728]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:59:04.728 --> 02:59:09.891]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:59:09.891 --> 02:59:11.572]  There are more than 42 million smokers
[02:59:11.752 --> 02:59:12.112]  I don't know.
[02:59:34.500 --> 02:59:35.220]  Coast to coast.
[02:59:35.220 --> 02:59:35.940]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:35.940 --> 02:59:38.641]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[02:59:59.711 --> 03:00:01.917]  Well, everybody's heard about the bed.
[03:00:01.917 --> 03:00:03.400]  B-b-b-bed, bed, bed.
[03:00:03.400 --> 03:00:05.846]  The bed's a winner when the bed, bed, bed.
[03:00:05.846 --> 03:00:07.991]  The bed is a winner when the bed, bed, bed.
[03:00:20.242 --> 03:00:24.863]  Wait a minute, this guy is claiming that he knows what the word is?
[03:00:24.863 --> 03:00:30.185]  Having his own opinion that isn't one of the CIA or the globalists is called a conspiracy theory.
[03:00:30.185 --> 03:00:41.569]  You're not supposed to have any original decisions of your own or any views about the bird.
[03:00:41.569 --> 03:00:48.891]  And I guess that I'm going to parrot a conspiracy theory if I go, ma-mow-mow-mow, ma-ma-ma-mow-mow-mow-mow, ma-ma-mow-mow-mow.
[03:00:50.123 --> 03:00:52.784]  Bring it up!
[03:00:52.784 --> 03:01:07.790]  Of course, they won't call them a conspiracy theorist for saying the bird's the word.
[03:01:07.790 --> 03:01:11.332]  Because that doesn't really affect the establishment.
[03:01:11.332 --> 03:01:19.235]  But if I show all the admitted documents and foreign news articles and admissions of our government, Saudi Arabia, and others funding ISIS,
[03:01:21.241 --> 03:01:26.043]  Or Benjamin Netanyahu endorsing ISIS in the Jerusalem Post.
[03:01:26.043 --> 03:01:32.325]  They'll just have Keith Overman or maybe Geraldo Rivera call me a conspiracy theorist.
[03:01:32.325 --> 03:01:33.606]  Oh, please don't do that.
[03:01:33.606 --> 03:01:37.567]  By the way, I'm not responding to them because it's hurting me.
[03:01:37.567 --> 03:01:43.209]  I'm showing how discredited you are telling us that you control reality.
[03:01:50.947 --> 03:01:52.408]  Put that guy on some Prozac.
[03:01:52.408 --> 03:01:53.609]  He sounds like he's having too much fun.
[03:01:53.609 --> 03:01:59.073]  All right, let's go ahead and go to Michael, the balance of this segment.
[03:01:59.073 --> 03:02:00.734]  I'm going to everybody after the break.
[03:02:00.734 --> 03:02:01.714]  Michael, thanks for holding.
[03:02:01.714 --> 03:02:02.635]  You're a trooper.
[03:02:02.635 --> 03:02:03.956]  You're on the air worldwide.
[03:02:03.956 --> 03:02:05.617]  Welcome to the airwaves.
[03:02:05.617 --> 03:02:07.718]  Hey, thanks, Alex.
[03:02:07.718 --> 03:02:12.282]  You were always talking about who's going to benefit from the profit of the Ebola vaccine.
[03:02:12.282 --> 03:02:13.142]  Yes, sir.
[03:02:13.142 --> 03:02:20.047]  And a friend of mine told me about TKMR stock, which is pretty well talked about on the Internet today.
[03:02:21.191 --> 03:02:24.152]  So you're about to give me an analysis that's outside of mainstream media.
[03:02:24.152 --> 03:02:27.113]  You're about to form an opinion off of verifiable facts.
[03:02:27.113 --> 03:02:28.533]  That's called hate.
[03:02:28.533 --> 03:02:29.694]  That's called racism.
[03:02:29.694 --> 03:02:31.034]  That's called sexism.
[03:02:31.034 --> 03:02:33.275]  That's called homophobia.
[03:02:33.275 --> 03:02:34.375]  Yeah, I did research.
[03:02:34.375 --> 03:02:36.296]  It's horrible.
[03:02:36.296 --> 03:02:42.838]  Well, TKMR Stocks is for the company TechMira, and that stock is up
[03:02:44.029 --> 03:02:47.890]  $24.31 today from $7 back in January.
[03:02:47.890 --> 03:02:58.373]  Well, they are supposedly the ones that are going to have the Ebola vaccine, and I started doing research on who owns this company, and it's Mark J. Murray.
[03:02:58.373 --> 03:03:11.296]  He's a CEO who used to work for another company called Protiva, and they've done studies about cancer that has supposedly cured cancer cells in animals without hurting the good cells.
[03:03:11.296 --> 03:03:11.556]  Well,
[03:03:13.311 --> 03:03:19.373]  Then I started looking and looking through all the small print going back years and years ago and the stuff I was finding.
[03:03:19.373 --> 03:03:26.535]  And some of their investors and contractors, well one of the investors is the Department of Defense.
[03:03:26.535 --> 03:03:30.417]  And one of the other people that's involved with them is J.P.
[03:03:30.417 --> 03:03:31.477]  Morgan.
[03:03:31.477 --> 03:03:32.397]  Ah!
[03:03:32.397 --> 03:03:32.758]  J.P.
[03:03:32.758 --> 03:03:33.098]  Morgan.
[03:03:33.098 --> 03:03:37.379]  Well, again, I don't know enough about the company to pass judgment on them.
[03:03:37.379 --> 03:03:39.120]  But obviously it's good that you're digging in.
[03:03:39.120 --> 03:03:42.181]  It's good that you're looking into things and committing a thought crime.
[03:03:43.183 --> 03:03:43.803]  But J.P.
[03:03:43.803 --> 03:03:47.764]  Morgan is generally involved in anything evil.
[03:03:47.764 --> 03:03:51.985]  They fund gun control, they fund open borders, they fund the U.N.
[03:03:51.985 --> 03:03:52.945]  garbage.
[03:03:52.945 --> 03:03:53.985]  Goldman Sachs and J.P.
[03:03:53.985 --> 03:03:56.145]  Morgan are the top of the pyramid.
[03:03:56.145 --> 03:03:57.425]  They are the problem.
[03:03:57.425 --> 03:04:04.427]  You can debate individuals that own stock in it or whatever, private or public stock, but at the end of the day, they're the problem.
[03:04:04.427 --> 03:04:10.308]  And we know there's going to be profiteering off of anything.
[03:04:10.308 --> 03:04:12.308]  What's your final breakdown on this?
[03:04:14.094 --> 03:04:23.481]  It's like you've been talking about, who's going to profit from all the hype from all this?
[03:04:23.481 --> 03:04:27.764]  Who's going to fearmonger people into wanting to get the vaccines and so forth?
[03:04:27.764 --> 03:04:32.447]  I know you talked with a veterinarian earlier about animals.
[03:04:32.447 --> 03:04:35.690]  I don't even get my dogs vaccinated because I know how bad it is.
[03:04:35.690 --> 03:04:37.551]  I haven't had a flu shot.
[03:04:37.551 --> 03:04:38.312]  I don't even know when.
[03:04:38.312 --> 03:04:42.214]  Yeah, I mean, I've been there in the years I worked for vets.
[03:04:43.476 --> 03:04:44.496]  Let me not exaggerate.
[03:04:44.496 --> 03:04:49.378]  At least more than 10 times where they'd give a dog a shot and it'd start having convulsions.
[03:04:49.378 --> 03:04:55.721]  And again, anybody with a brain can figure out, boy, these shots must not be too good.
[03:04:55.721 --> 03:04:56.761]  And then your dog's never sick.
[03:04:56.761 --> 03:04:58.722]  It gets a shot and then it's sick for the rest of its life.
[03:05:03.629 --> 03:05:04.771]  Whoa!
[03:05:04.771 --> 03:05:07.234]  This is big!
[03:05:07.234 --> 03:05:13.022]  By popular demand, the Freeze-Dry Guy's Giant Factory Authorized Sale has been extended.

[03:05:47.065 --> 03:05:53.007]  The Giant Factory Authorized Mountain House Sale with savings of 30-45% is extended through August.
[03:05:53.007 --> 03:05:59.369]  From the Freeze Dry Guy, the finest freeze-dried and dehydrated foods available anywhere for long-term storage.
[03:06:00.410 --> 03:06:04.454]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[03:06:04.454 --> 03:06:08.759]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[03:06:08.759 --> 03:06:12.422]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[03:06:12.422 --> 03:06:15.445]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[03:06:15.445 --> 03:06:22.713]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[03:06:22.913 --> 03:06:26.815]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[03:06:26.815 --> 03:06:31.216]  You filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[03:06:31.216 --> 03:06:37.119]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[03:06:37.119 --> 03:06:41.160]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[03:06:41.160 --> 03:06:43.741]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[03:06:43.741 --> 03:06:45.082]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[03:06:45.242 --> 03:06:46.583]  It's time to take action.
[03:06:46.583 --> 03:06:48.405]  It's time to filter our water.

[03:07:01.092 --> 03:07:03.374]  Mike Stenerson from Midas Resources.
[03:07:03.374 --> 03:07:06.697]  In no time in history have precious metals been more important.
[03:07:06.697 --> 03:07:09.440]  Certainly not in my 22 years in the industry.
[03:07:09.440 --> 03:07:13.404]  The dollar has lost over 90% of its value in the last 60 years.
[03:07:13.404 --> 03:07:17.147]  No fiat currency has ever survived the government printing presses.
[03:07:17.147 --> 03:07:18.569]  Ours is not immune.
[03:07:18.569 --> 03:07:20.230]  The time is now to be proactive.
[03:07:20.230 --> 03:07:20.791]  1-800-686-2237 extension 116.
[03:07:25.535 --> 03:07:28.236]  Anything tied to the dollar is at risk.
[03:07:28.236 --> 03:07:33.817]  CDs, annuities, 401Ks, IRAs, stocks, bonds, you name it, so decide.
[03:07:33.817 --> 03:07:37.157]  Do you want to leave a legacy of wealth or debt for your family?
[03:07:37.157 --> 03:07:38.458]  The choice is yours.
[03:07:38.458 --> 03:07:39.538]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237 extension 116.
[03:07:39.538 --> 03:07:40.678]  That's 1-800-686-2237 extension 116.
[03:07:40.678 --> 03:07:41.698]  Be proactive, not reactive.
[03:07:41.698 --> 03:07:41.878]  Call 1-800-686-2237
[03:07:55.741 --> 03:08:10.673]  Extension 116.
[03:08:10.673 --> 03:08:12.194]  Fix bayonets.
[03:08:12.194 --> 03:08:14.596]  We are now entering overdrive.
[03:08:14.596 --> 03:08:19.780]  With your host, Alex Jones broadcasting live from the front lines.
[03:08:19.780 --> 03:08:23.423]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:08:25.208 --> 03:08:27.309]  And I gotta be honest with people.
[03:08:27.309 --> 03:08:32.612]  The globalists mean to take over with ambient corruption.
[03:08:32.612 --> 03:08:35.674]  Slowly reprogramming the human genetic code.
[03:08:35.674 --> 03:08:39.316]  Slowly putting their Trojan horses into anything and everything.
[03:08:39.316 --> 03:08:42.358]  Until civilization as we know it has been overtaken.
[03:08:42.358 --> 03:08:44.780]  And that's stated in all their official documents.
[03:08:44.780 --> 03:08:47.401]  I've made films on the subject like Endgame.
[03:08:47.401 --> 03:08:49.903]  Blueprint for global enslavement if you feel like knowing the truth.
[03:08:49.903 --> 03:08:50.963]  It's free online.
[03:08:50.963 --> 03:08:53.585]  Or you can buy the DVD and support us and have a hard copy.
[03:08:55.672 --> 03:09:00.373]  We can take control of our development if we decide to take control.
[03:09:00.373 --> 03:09:14.416]  They tell us that's a conspiracy theory, that no one's engineering, there's no social engineering, there's no control, everything's just magically happening on its own, there's no invisible hand directing human development right now.
[03:09:14.416 --> 03:09:18.137]  But then you read all their white papers, they're totally directing everything.
[03:09:18.137 --> 03:09:19.897]  Towards a very bad end for most people.
[03:09:21.144 --> 03:09:41.616]  And sure, you can see a bunch of people with their pants hanging down around their ankles, looting shops, and say, well, you know, humanity's lazy and stupid and criminal, so wipe us out, until you realize the globalists have been pushing agendas that have literally made those communities like that, when those communities just 60, 70 years ago were not like that.
[03:09:41.616 --> 03:09:49.581]  They have literally turned young black males, and then now young white males, Hispanic males, into morons.
[03:09:52.712 --> 03:10:02.636]  60, 70 years ago in Mexico, there were not people worshipping death, tattooing skulls on their faces, and worshipping who would murder the most innocent people.
[03:10:02.636 --> 03:10:13.841]  30 years ago, people were not wearing their pants hanging down around their knees, which means I'm a punk, have sex with me in the prison, and running around looting shops at the first chance they could.
[03:10:16.047 --> 03:10:19.369]  This is the sick MTV mind control culture.
[03:10:19.369 --> 03:10:24.231]  So I don't look at these pathetic people and then go, oh, look, they're a bunch of scum, let's kill them.
[03:10:24.231 --> 03:10:27.672]  I understand the globalists are now doing this to every community.
[03:10:27.672 --> 03:10:33.435]  And if they haven't gotten to your family yet, they will.
[03:10:33.435 --> 03:10:40.658]  Now, under political correctness, though, we're not supposed to decry this culture so we can keep growing like a cancer.
[03:10:40.658 --> 03:10:42.959]  So see, out of one side of their mouth, don't decry it.
[03:10:42.959 --> 03:10:43.900]  This is a great culture.
[03:10:44.690 --> 03:10:48.953]  And they show people acting like thugs, dressed like idiots, getting all the women.
[03:10:48.953 --> 03:10:54.476]  And people watch that on TV and believe that that's the culture we should adopt.
[03:10:54.476 --> 03:10:58.098]  And people are adopting it and wondering why they're so incredibly unhappy.
[03:10:58.098 --> 03:11:00.620]  Instead of go to your phone calls, let's just go to them.
[03:11:00.620 --> 03:11:05.083]  I'm speaking of the riots, of course, that have been taking place in Ferguson, Missouri.
[03:11:07.242 --> 03:11:13.506]  Now it's a whole new Trayvon Martin deal with the Justice Department front lawyer running down there to stir the pot again.
[03:11:13.506 --> 03:11:17.928]  Well, the Justice Department was caught last time behind the whole thing.
[03:11:17.928 --> 03:11:21.970]  Because black folks aren't getting anything from Obama.
[03:11:21.970 --> 03:11:24.612]  So he'll give them racial hatred.
[03:11:24.612 --> 03:11:27.273]  That's basically the only possession.
[03:11:27.273 --> 03:11:29.855]  Mike in California, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:11:29.855 --> 03:11:31.756]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[03:11:31.756 --> 03:11:33.517]  It's going alright brother, good to talk to you.
[03:11:34.284 --> 03:11:34.944]  Right on.
[03:11:34.944 --> 03:12:01.590]  Hey, I'm super excited about that last segment with Chuck Baldwin, and having been one that attends churches and his description of things being like a Christian happy hour, the Church Liberty Project seems like a critical thing, because we're losing a lot of foundation here with the way that this new program has moved into a lot of the churches.
[03:12:05.461 --> 03:12:23.647]  I hope also, too, that there's a possibility of some visual presentation for the Liberty Church curriculum to be presented, perhaps in a DVD form, because this is a message that really needs to go out.
[03:12:23.647 --> 03:12:25.328]  He's actually doing that right now.
[03:12:25.328 --> 03:12:25.888]  Great points.
[03:12:25.888 --> 03:12:27.088]  Appreciate you holding.
[03:12:27.088 --> 03:12:27.728]  Listening on 1340 AM KOMY.
[03:12:30.407 --> 03:12:32.408]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ben in Missouri.
[03:12:32.408 --> 03:12:33.988]  Thanks for holding your on the air.
[03:12:33.988 --> 03:12:37.010]  Listening on the free InfoWars iPhone app.
[03:12:37.010 --> 03:12:38.470]  Go ahead.
[03:12:38.470 --> 03:12:40.871]  Hey Alex, it's good to speak to you again.
[03:12:40.871 --> 03:12:43.172]  Just wanted to say thanks real quick.
[03:12:43.172 --> 03:12:43.833]  I'm here in St.
[03:12:43.833 --> 03:12:52.296]  Louis and I've been able to see this whole incident in Ferguson pan out kind of first hand.
[03:12:52.296 --> 03:12:59.159]  But the reason why I was calling is because I knew as soon as this happened that it was going to turn and the media is turning it from
[03:13:00.427 --> 03:13:09.772]  Police, you know, militarization of the police, evisceration of the Bill of Rights, evisceration of due process, and they're turning it into a race issue.
[03:13:09.772 --> 03:13:12.893]  And I just can't stand it because it's not a race issue.
[03:13:12.893 --> 03:13:14.554]  It is not a race issue.
[03:13:14.554 --> 03:13:17.435]  It is a police citizen issue.
[03:13:17.435 --> 03:13:18.776]  And the media knows that if they
[03:13:19.665 --> 03:13:20.105]  Use that.
[03:13:41.969 --> 03:13:46.850]  Again, diverts away from if the police did something wrong.
[03:13:46.850 --> 03:13:51.411]  And if the police did something wrong, it should be an issue.
[03:13:51.411 --> 03:13:52.412]  But you're right.
[03:13:52.412 --> 03:14:05.195]  This is really about people acting like morons when the cops do something wrong, and then that being used as a pretext to bring in even more militarization of police, which is the exact opposite of what we need.
[03:14:07.366 --> 03:14:07.886]  Does that make sense?
[03:14:07.886 --> 03:14:08.887]  Correct.
[03:14:08.887 --> 03:14:10.028]  But, I mean, you're there.
[03:14:10.028 --> 03:14:13.351]  You say you're... I mean, you say you basically watch it unfold.
[03:14:13.351 --> 03:14:15.232]  Are you in Ferguson?
[03:14:15.232 --> 03:14:15.753]  No, no.
[03:14:15.753 --> 03:14:17.834]  I live in the... I actually live in the city of St.
[03:14:17.834 --> 03:14:18.935]  Louis, in South City.
[03:14:18.935 --> 03:14:31.946]  Because, I mean, what happens is you've got a bunch of people that have gotten into thug life, thug culture, who then think they're entitled to hate everybody who isn't a thug, and in many cases to be anti-white and racist.
[03:14:33.410 --> 03:14:45.939]  Who then basically run around doing whatever they want, and it's okay because they're downtrodden, including preying on their quote, own people in these predominantly black neighborhoods.
[03:14:45.939 --> 03:14:48.661]  So, I don't want to endorse what they're doing.
[03:14:48.661 --> 03:14:54.565]  I also don't want to endorse, in many cases, how the police, you know, treat so-called minorities.
[03:14:54.565 --> 03:14:58.007]  But again, in most areas of this country, whites are already a minority.
[03:14:58.007 --> 03:15:00.609]  Within five years, whites will officially be a minority.
[03:15:01.465 --> 03:15:04.566]  But still, I'll be blamed for everything under the sun.
[03:15:04.566 --> 03:15:09.669]  So, briefly, give us your take on what really happened.
[03:15:09.669 --> 03:15:18.633]  Well, I mean, in my personal experience with the police, you know, it is really a shoot first, ask questions later mentality among the police.
[03:15:18.633 --> 03:15:22.754]  And so, although I... Are you there?
[03:15:22.754 --> 03:15:23.575]  We didn't hang up on you.
[03:15:23.575 --> 03:15:24.795]  Go ahead.
[03:15:24.795 --> 03:15:25.636]  Yeah, I'm here.
[03:15:25.636 --> 03:15:26.096]  Can you hear me?
[03:15:26.096 --> 03:15:27.717]  You got somebody calling you on call waiting.
[03:15:27.717 --> 03:15:28.377]  Go ahead and finish up.
[03:15:29.491 --> 03:15:39.279]  Alright, basically my take on it is, you know, I've seen the way police act around here and I know the mentality of the police in many places around the St.
[03:15:39.279 --> 03:15:39.920]  Louis area.
[03:15:39.920 --> 03:15:43.843]  I mean, you have certain different municipalities in St.
[03:15:43.843 --> 03:15:52.531]  Louis County that are notorious for being, you know, having that almost police gang mentality that they have.
[03:15:53.038 --> 03:15:59.797]  You know, I'm certainly not condoning the fact that, you know, the lowest common denominator is running around with their pants around their ankles.
[03:16:00.433 --> 03:16:03.154]  Burning, quick trip to the ground, doing this, that, and the other thing.
[03:16:03.154 --> 03:16:05.335]  Nobody is saying that that's okay.
[03:16:05.335 --> 03:16:06.996]  But Ferguson is... Yeah, well here's the deal.
[03:16:06.996 --> 03:16:11.959]  If somebody comes and tries to burn my house or my business down, I'm gonna shoot them deader than a hammer.
[03:16:11.959 --> 03:16:15.060]  Because burning something down can kill innocent people, and it's my property.
[03:16:15.060 --> 03:16:16.361]  It's not because they're black.
[03:16:16.361 --> 03:16:17.281]  And I'm gonna tell you something, too.
[03:16:17.281 --> 03:16:22.464]  I'm not gonna enjoy killing people, but my instincts to do the right thing are there.
[03:16:22.464 --> 03:16:24.004]  I cannot be run over.
[03:16:24.004 --> 03:16:26.966]  Now, if a bunch of paramilitary police show up to take me to a FEMA camp,
[03:16:27.526 --> 03:16:29.527]  Yeah, well, you're exactly right about that.
[03:16:29.527 --> 03:16:32.348]  I mean, that's the unraveling of our society, that it's become that.
[03:16:32.348 --> 03:16:34.530]  You know, you have the media
[03:16:43.892 --> 03:16:52.482]  Uh, endorsing and glamorizing the thug culture, and so therefore, what do black kids without dads at home, what are they going to think?
[03:16:52.482 --> 03:16:55.586]  They're automatically going to think, you know, this is the way to the top.
[03:16:55.586 --> 03:17:01.333]  I have to be either a rapper, I have to be a sports star, I have to be this, I have to be that, or else I'm nothing.
[03:17:01.553 --> 03:17:06.814]  Yeah, not that I can own a lawn business and have 20 people under me and make half a million dollars a year.
[03:17:06.814 --> 03:17:11.456]  Not that I can own a pool company and have 50 people under me and make a million dollars profit a year.
[03:17:11.456 --> 03:17:17.437]  Or, you know, not that I can start a restaurant and, you know, and then build another one and then be middle class.
[03:17:17.437 --> 03:17:23.479]  All these young people, literally, not just black people, believe they're going to be a movie star or something and it's delusional
[03:17:24.159 --> 03:17:28.062]  And then meanwhile, remember a few years ago, in St.
[03:17:28.062 --> 03:17:32.845]  Louis, they had regular army rolling around getting ready for martial law.
[03:17:32.845 --> 03:17:34.726]  They've actuaried out different regions.
[03:17:34.726 --> 03:17:40.410]  They know where the hotspots are, and they're getting ready for collapse in places like East St.
[03:17:40.410 --> 03:17:43.052]  Louis and pre-deploying all these armored vehicles.
[03:17:43.052 --> 03:17:47.214]  And they're now rolling more of them in, but saying, oh, it's for homeland security.
[03:17:47.214 --> 03:17:53.639]  Armored Humvees, the MRAPs, Bradley fighting vehicles, Warrior fighting vehicles.
[03:17:54.679 --> 03:18:07.823]  They're going to set the precedent if Obama could start a race war and get poor black people to run around and burn stuff, to roll in and crush them, and then the precedent will be set with all the illegals pouring in and the rest of it.
[03:18:07.823 --> 03:18:13.105]  I'm telling you, I've been saying this all week and last week, they are trying to get this country to blow up right now.
[03:18:13.105 --> 03:18:16.666]  I appreciate your call.
[03:18:16.666 --> 03:18:20.047]  It's a very frustrating time to be, you know, witnessing all this.
[03:18:21.104 --> 03:18:33.671]  Very frustrating time to be alive because the military are stuck in the rock in a hard place, the police are, the citizens are, we're all being manipulated here.
[03:18:33.671 --> 03:18:41.036]  We're all being manipulated by the globalists who are controlling the stimuli in an experiment, testing to see what's going to happen.
[03:18:41.036 --> 03:18:48.520]  And then using the de-evolution of society as a pretext for more control.
[03:18:48.520 --> 03:18:49.441]  It's all been planned.
[03:18:50.626 --> 03:18:55.587]  I'm gonna get to that in a moment after calls, but they're on record arming ISIS, folks.
[03:18:55.587 --> 03:19:00.488]  And again, they don't run them, they protect them, they open the door for them.
[03:19:00.488 --> 03:19:12.150]  Just like if I had a hundred piranhas, and I fed them, you know, and trained them to eat at a certain time every week in a freshwater pool, and then I trick some three-year-old kid to jump in the pool.
[03:19:12.150 --> 03:19:13.710]  I don't run the piranhas.
[03:19:13.710 --> 03:19:15.530]  They don't take orders from me.
[03:19:15.530 --> 03:19:18.731]  They know on Sunday morning at noon, I feed them.
[03:19:22.600 --> 03:19:32.085]  And so it's Sunday morning at noon, and they're all waiting, getting excited, biting each other, swimming around in a big swarm, and I get the three-year-old neighbor, come on over here, get in the pool!
[03:19:32.085 --> 03:19:33.346]  And that's Al-Qaeda, folks.
[03:19:33.346 --> 03:19:38.288]  They've bred them, they run them, they feed them, they don't control them.
[03:19:38.288 --> 03:19:44.291]  But with Pavlovian conditioning, they know when it's feeding time.
[03:19:44.291 --> 03:19:45.032]  And God help us.
[03:19:46.684 --> 03:19:56.080]  Because Lindsey Graham says they're getting ready to blow everything up and they're allowed to operate on Twitter and Facebook and YouTube, but I get kicked off all the time for no reason.
[03:19:56.080 --> 03:19:58.745]  Navy SEALs expose Benghazi, they get kicked off.
[03:20:04.414 --> 03:20:14.037]  Navy SEALs had a polite Facebook, remember last year, exposing Benghazi, and had little memes exposing what happened, and Facebook kicked them off over and over again.
[03:20:14.037 --> 03:20:21.479]  We tried to send their stuff out when they did that, and we got suspended for a week.
[03:20:21.479 --> 03:20:24.780]  Navy SEALs don't have free speech in America, but ISIS does.
[03:20:24.780 --> 03:20:29.981]  I mean, that's what we're talking about here, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:20:29.981 --> 03:20:31.942]  This country's going to hell in a handbasket.
[03:20:34.124 --> 03:20:38.207]  Dennis in Minnesota, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:20:38.207 --> 03:20:43.590]  Denise, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[03:20:43.590 --> 03:20:59.501]  I'm calling about the police state, and I'm middle-aged, and a friend of mine and I decided to go on a road trip on Saturday, and we drove down into, you know, farm country, rural farm country in Minnesota.
[03:21:00.234 --> 03:21:00.894]  We're good to go.
[03:21:25.490 --> 03:21:34.533]  And so I go through the stop sign, pull over, roll down my windows, he comes up and says, um, uh, do you know why I pulled you over?
[03:21:34.533 --> 03:21:38.174]  I looked at my friend and she looked at me and I said, no.
[03:21:38.174 --> 03:21:39.875]  He said, do you know what the speed limit is?
[03:21:39.875 --> 03:21:41.475]  I said, yes.
[03:21:41.475 --> 03:21:42.836]  Told him what it was.
[03:21:42.836 --> 03:21:46.477]  He said, well, I clocked you at going such and such.
[03:21:46.477 --> 03:21:49.038]  And I didn't say anything and he was wrong.
[03:21:49.038 --> 03:21:49.918]  He was wrong.
[03:21:49.918 --> 03:21:51.098]  I wasn't speeding.
[03:21:51.098 --> 03:21:52.079]  I knew it.
[03:21:52.079 --> 03:21:52.839]  She knew it.
[03:21:52.839 --> 03:21:53.259]  I knew it.
[03:21:54.099 --> 03:21:58.681]  Then he says to me, where are you going?
[03:21:58.681 --> 03:22:00.401]  I said home.
[03:22:00.401 --> 03:22:02.822]  Where were you?
[03:22:02.822 --> 03:22:06.404]  I said, you know, the name of the town we were at.
[03:22:06.404 --> 03:22:14.347]  And then he says, um, do you have your driver's license and your, um, proof of insurance?
[03:22:14.347 --> 03:22:19.428]  And I said, yeah, and I was fumbling around looking for my proof of insurance and I gave it to him.
[03:22:19.428 --> 03:22:23.310]  And, um, what was the nature of your trip?
[03:22:23.834 --> 03:22:29.218]  But then you told him I'm an illegal alien and he got you a free bus and some money and said bye-bye?
[03:22:29.218 --> 03:22:37.344]  Yeah, my friend almost said, you know, after he left she said you should have just hit the floor, Denise, tell him and Louise and gone away.
[03:22:37.344 --> 03:22:44.750]  But I was like... No, no, but listen, I mean the issue is they're tailored to go after the general public now and get us in the system.
[03:22:45.730 --> 03:22:47.811]  And basically, martial law light.
[03:22:47.811 --> 03:22:49.512]  But then, as I'm saying, it's all illegitimate.
[03:22:49.512 --> 03:22:50.373]  They're funding Al-Qaeda.
[03:22:50.373 --> 03:22:51.834]  The border's open.
[03:22:51.834 --> 03:22:56.696]  And you drive through all these weird jurisdictions where it might be a nice police, nice sheriffs.
[03:22:56.696 --> 03:22:58.598]  You go into another area, it's a bunch of crooks.
[03:22:58.598 --> 03:23:00.759]  You go into another area, it's a mix.
[03:23:00.759 --> 03:23:02.380]  It's Russian roulette.
[03:23:02.380 --> 03:23:04.041]  And it's so creepy.
[03:23:04.041 --> 03:23:09.364]  I mean, there are Texas towns where they take the money out of your wallet and then brag about it on TV.
[03:23:09.364 --> 03:23:11.185]  So, how did it all end?
[03:23:11.185 --> 03:23:13.346]  He just kept asking you the little secret police questions.
[03:23:13.831 --> 03:23:14.892]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:23:14.892 --> 03:23:25.780]  And I just, I knew, I knew based upon listening to you and other people and everything that I just needed to keep my mouth shut, be polite, go on my merry way, right?
[03:23:25.780 --> 03:23:32.606]  But I was so, I felt so invaded and so angry.
[03:23:32.606 --> 03:23:35.468]  Number one, I was not speeding and I knew it.
[03:23:35.468 --> 03:23:36.469]  And so did my friend.
[03:23:37.510 --> 03:23:47.735]  And the fact that he thought he had the right to ask me whatever he wanted to, and it was like they were scripted questions.
[03:23:47.735 --> 03:23:56.420]  Well, I mean, the larger issue is the country's gone and they're destroyed as well.
[03:23:56.420 --> 03:24:03.003]  So I hope they enjoy it because, you know, this country deserves judgment and we're going to get it.
[03:24:04.366 --> 03:24:14.009]  And so, there's a lot of police know the truth, but there's a lot of police that, you know, think harassing women with, you know, with no criminal records is the way to go.
[03:24:14.009 --> 03:24:16.890]  I see news articles all the time speaking of Missouri, which is really bad.
[03:24:16.890 --> 03:24:25.793]  A lot of the police departments, the state police and others, even though I've been sent some good stuff by the state police up there before, it's very authoritarian.
[03:24:25.793 --> 03:24:30.434]  And you pull up to mainline checkpoints on major highways, they come over, go, I'm gonna search your car, get out.
[03:24:30.434 --> 03:24:33.275]  People say, I have a Fourth Amendment, they'll drag you out, just flip out.
[03:24:34.771 --> 03:24:40.633]  And say don't film me and all this other stuff, and they're scary.
[03:24:40.633 --> 03:24:43.654]  And it's all federal grants.
[03:24:43.654 --> 03:24:50.996]  And those cops need to know they're being trained to do this because the country is going to be destroyed.
[03:24:50.996 --> 03:24:58.538]  And they're being prepared to carry out the end of America, folks.
[03:24:58.538 --> 03:25:00.019]  And it's not to protect the country.
[03:25:05.472 --> 03:25:06.893]  You know, I got a bunch of other callers.
[03:25:06.893 --> 03:25:10.254]  Some of them have been holding 40 minutes, 19 minutes, 12 minutes, 6 minutes.
[03:25:10.254 --> 03:25:13.795]  I'll try to get to a few more, but I've got to hit this news because I promise to.
[03:25:13.795 --> 03:25:16.136]  Here's the headline, InfoWars.com.
[03:25:16.136 --> 03:25:21.218]  Lindsey Graham tells Obama, go to war in Iraq where American cities will burn in flames.
[03:25:21.218 --> 03:25:28.941]  He's the same guy that said, you know, do it, you know, launch, attack Syria or Al-Qaeda will nuke the west, the east coast.
[03:25:28.941 --> 03:25:30.361]  Remember that?
[03:25:30.361 --> 03:25:31.762]  When our government's arming Al-Qaeda.
[03:25:32.383 --> 03:25:36.986]  We have to attack Al-Qaeda's enemy in Syria or they'll get us.
[03:25:36.986 --> 03:25:41.729]  And maybe he meant the deal with Saudi Arabia is that they'd turn into Iraq and attack us if we didn't do it.
[03:25:41.729 --> 03:25:43.451]  I mean, it's getting weird.
[03:25:43.451 --> 03:25:45.892]  But that video's up on InfoWars.com.
[03:25:45.892 --> 03:25:46.112]  U.S.
[03:25:46.112 --> 03:25:49.955]  starts providing weapons to Kurdish forces in Iraq report.
[03:25:49.955 --> 03:25:53.638]  Just like they provided weapons to Al-Qaeda so everybody can kill each other.
[03:25:53.638 --> 03:25:55.219]  Kurds did nothing to us, deserve all this.
[03:25:56.227 --> 03:26:00.108]  Christian brothers and sisters, did you know your government is supporting Islamic terrorists?
[03:26:00.108 --> 03:26:05.790]  Big article up on Infowars.com showing all the proof on that from Washington's blog.
[03:26:05.790 --> 03:26:09.151]  Obama's out golfing and vacationing as usual.
[03:26:09.151 --> 03:26:15.233]  The Turkish presidential election basically made this guy even more of a dictator.
[03:26:15.233 --> 03:26:17.734]  You can have elected dictators that then abolish the old system.
[03:26:20.219 --> 03:26:23.781]  I've got a big stack of articles here dealing with political correctness.
[03:26:23.781 --> 03:26:26.823]  This is out of Egan News.
[03:26:26.823 --> 03:26:44.975]  Superintendent on snack rules says it's asinine we don't have enough teachers now and have to hire food police and now they're saying they can't even have bake sales that associate and give money to the school even if it's private groups because under federal regulations you can't have any type of cake being sold and it's all Michelle Obama running it.
[03:26:44.975 --> 03:26:49.538]  Again, that's a real free country where the dictator tells you what you eat.
[03:26:50.768 --> 03:26:53.310]  District stops federal lunch program over all this.
[03:26:53.310 --> 03:26:54.351]  That's out of Cincinnati.
[03:26:54.351 --> 03:26:57.574]  Because they said the lunches were so bad and made kids sick.
[03:26:57.574 --> 03:26:59.876]  It's not that they weren't even healthy either.
[03:26:59.876 --> 03:27:02.098]  They're like full of aspartame and stuff.
[03:27:02.098 --> 03:27:05.301]  ESPN suspends host for domestic abuse story.
[03:27:05.301 --> 03:27:08.543]  I read this this morning and thought, oh, what, did he beat his wife?
[03:27:08.543 --> 03:27:10.165]  No.
[03:27:10.165 --> 03:27:11.846]  No.
[03:27:11.846 --> 03:27:16.210]  Years ago, he said a girlfriend hit him, so he hit her back.
[03:27:16.210 --> 03:27:17.111]  So if we're being honest,
[03:27:18.410 --> 03:27:21.851]  California debates yes means yes sex law.
[03:27:21.851 --> 03:27:25.933]  AP, the feminists basically say all sex is rape.
[03:27:25.933 --> 03:27:29.274]  Men inherently are evil unless you marry the state, that's your man.
[03:27:29.274 --> 03:27:35.596]  And so now even if a woman says yes to sex on record, at any time she can decide it's rape and put you in prison.
[03:27:35.596 --> 03:27:39.618]  So that's just a way so women can set men up.
[03:27:39.618 --> 03:27:42.959]  It's pretty incredible how screwed up this country is, isn't it?
[03:27:42.959 --> 03:27:45.560]  White students no longer to be majority in school, AP.
[03:27:46.923 --> 03:27:47.343]  That's right.
[03:27:47.343 --> 03:27:51.988]  All over the country, folks, whites are no longer the majority in children.
[03:27:51.988 --> 03:27:53.089]  And, I mean, whatever.
[03:27:53.089 --> 03:27:53.710]  That's fine with me.
[03:27:53.710 --> 03:27:55.993]  It's just that I'm sick of hearing me fall on a banana peel.
[03:27:55.993 --> 03:27:57.554]  It's my fault, because I'm white.
[03:27:57.554 --> 03:28:03.460]  And inherently, you know, that my ancestors, you know, came up with quantum mechanics, the stock market, and...
[03:28:05.279 --> 03:28:06.080]  Most of science.
[03:28:06.080 --> 03:28:07.120]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[03:28:07.120 --> 03:28:08.101]  Sorry for the Renaissance.
[03:28:08.101 --> 03:28:08.861]  Sorry for Beethoven.
[03:28:08.861 --> 03:28:09.902]  Sorry for everything else.
[03:28:09.902 --> 03:28:12.003]  I mean, a lot of evil came out of Europe as well.
[03:28:12.003 --> 03:28:13.284]  But, I mean, look everywhere else.
[03:28:13.284 --> 03:28:14.125]  Just humans are humans.
[03:28:14.125 --> 03:28:16.826]  But I'm proud of Western civilization.
[03:28:16.826 --> 03:28:18.988]  And the globalists wanted it erased.
[03:28:18.988 --> 03:28:22.250]  And so, I hope everybody enjoys basically living in the third world.
[03:28:22.950 --> 03:28:26.712]  Because, you know, the Western civilization has turned into the technocracy.
[03:28:26.712 --> 03:28:28.934]  It's breaking away and going to Alpha Centauri's.
[03:28:28.934 --> 03:28:30.094]  We're to be wiped out here.
[03:28:30.094 --> 03:28:32.336]  So, just hope everybody enjoys that.
[03:28:32.336 --> 03:28:36.098]  But Tony Stewart hits and kills driver on upstate track.
[03:28:36.098 --> 03:28:36.878]  I've seen the video.
[03:28:36.878 --> 03:28:39.000]  Looks pretty damn deliberate to me.
[03:28:39.000 --> 03:28:41.922]  He reportedly threatened to do this to somebody else before.
[03:28:41.922 --> 03:28:47.185]  But they say no criminal charges are being looked at right now.
[03:28:49.585 --> 03:29:00.549]  So, uh, again, say you slapped your girlfriend back once, when she slaps you, you're gonna, you know, get suspended or lose your job, but, uh, I guess people like Tony Stewart, so it's not gonna be happening there.
[03:29:00.549 --> 03:29:03.891]  Steal a billion dollars, get a, you know, get made president.
[03:29:03.891 --> 03:29:06.072]  Steal, steal a stick of bubblegum, but put in prison.
[03:29:06.072 --> 03:29:07.092]  That's how it's always worked.
[03:29:08.689 --> 03:29:09.649]  So, we're out of time.
[03:29:09.649 --> 03:29:10.610]  Sorry to the rest of the callers.
[03:29:10.610 --> 03:29:11.830]  I wanted to overdrive to do that.
[03:29:11.830 --> 03:29:16.211]  Some other news up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:29:16.211 --> 03:29:20.893]  ExxonMobil ignores sanctions, begins drilling in Russian Arctic.
[03:29:20.893 --> 03:29:24.194]  Concerns about adverse impact of sanctions rising in Europe.
[03:29:26.957 --> 03:29:31.059]  Well, I mean, Halliburton operated in Iran during all the sanctions and Iraq.
[03:29:31.059 --> 03:29:40.685]  The top globalist ten corporations or so, Exxon's number two, under Walmart, number three, now it's under Apple, that's right.
[03:29:40.685 --> 03:29:42.066]  All the top guys don't follow anything.
[03:29:42.406 --> 03:29:48.375]  I mean, you know, Apple has literal death camps, suicide nets, forced abortions, black op command hell bases.
[03:29:48.375 --> 03:29:49.016]  They're liberal.
[03:29:49.016 --> 03:29:49.516]  We love them.
[03:29:49.516 --> 03:29:50.518]  They're trendy.
[03:29:50.518 --> 03:29:51.399]  They're about the law.
[03:29:51.399 --> 03:29:54.223]  You run a hell base, you're going to prison.
[03:29:54.223 --> 03:29:55.084]  Hellraisers!
[03:29:55.084 --> 03:29:56.146]  What they love!
[03:29:56.146 --> 03:29:58.689]  See you today, 7 o'clock central, Nightly News.
