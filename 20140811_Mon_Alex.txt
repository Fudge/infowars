[00:00.000 --> 00:14.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.160 --> 00:20.960]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.960 --> 00:35.280]  we're going to be covering the latest event that will be used like Trayvon Martin to promote
[00:35.280 --> 00:42.600]  racial division in this country and to make that the only issue not the globalist that are literally
[00:42.600 --> 00:51.200]  deindustrializing the country and artificially creating a climate of poverty as a tool of
[00:51.200 --> 00:58.680]  social control we will get into that today but there is so much so many other important stories
[00:58.680 --> 01:05.800]  that we've got to get to and yes now Trayvon Martin's family attorney is to represent the
[01:05.800 --> 01:18.360]  slain Missouri teen and info wars.com has discovered tweeted photos taken by citizens in
[01:18.360 --> 01:27.000]  Ferguson Missouri of looters wearing remember Trayvon Martin rest in peace Trayvon Martin shirts
[01:27.000 --> 01:38.840]  so the answer when the police questionably shoot an unarmed black teen is not to burn down grocery
[01:38.840 --> 01:45.600]  stores and convenience stores and people's houses and to burn up cars in your own neighborhood the
[01:45.600 --> 01:51.560]  answer would be to get politically involved and go after the police department if they've
[01:51.560 --> 01:58.000]  been proven wrong but doing stuff like this will only make the relations between the police and
[01:58.000 --> 02:08.200]  the black community that much worse and this is just a little forte a little hors d'oeuvre in the
[02:08.200 --> 02:15.880]  future of this nation especially when the media like MSNBC and the White House only have race
[02:15.880 --> 02:25.080]  baiting and and racial politics as their issues because they're not delivering on any other front
[02:25.080 --> 02:30.320]  they're not delivering jobs are even delivering bigger welfare checks they're just delivering
[02:30.320 --> 02:36.720]  collapse and their own people that have been gotten basically raised on welfare across the
[02:36.720 --> 02:42.440]  political spectrum are getting antsy are getting restless and the answer is let's just have a war
[02:42.440 --> 02:50.360]  with the police which is only going to then have the police be driven into the arms of the feds
[02:50.360 --> 02:55.680]  who are really globalist and have been occupied by the new world order they will then federalize
[02:55.680 --> 03:00.800]  the police create federal command centers militarize them and then they will bait and
[03:00.800 --> 03:05.120]  switch and use the paramilitary police on gun owners returning veterans Christians
[03:05.120 --> 03:11.640]  conservatives libertarians there's another photo in Paul Watson's article confirmed by local news
[03:11.640 --> 03:18.560]  to beat Bradley fighting vehicles rolling out to be refitted for homeland security people saw them
[03:18.560 --> 03:24.120]  rolling through the town last night as things were burning and we're cheering the National
[03:24.120 --> 03:29.800]  Guards here Obama has sent them because they've been federalized now the governor didn't send
[03:29.800 --> 03:38.120]  them the the the president didn't send them the Bradley fighting vehicles are being sent for
[03:38.120 --> 03:44.760]  homeland security and North com for the American people and gun owners and Obama told the New York
[03:44.760 --> 03:48.480]  Times over the weekend in an article published in the New York Times he did the interview a week
[03:48.480 --> 03:53.840]  ago and they were poorly and put video out later the interview as well but it's text right now
[03:53.840 --> 04:01.240]  that the number one threat to America is conservatives and extremist ideology that is
[04:01.240 --> 04:09.800]  quote taken over the GOP well it is true the libertarian reality based survival movement is
[04:09.800 --> 04:15.800]  taking over the GOP because the GOP leadership has sold out to the globalist and so we're
[04:15.800 --> 04:23.560]  kicking these people out not just Eric canner the march is on and so this is the threat the
[04:23.560 --> 04:29.880]  tea party is the threat to the globalist not that it's perfect but it is real opposition doesn't
[04:29.880 --> 04:33.160]  want to bankrupt the country doesn't want to take the guns doesn't want to open the borders
[04:33.160 --> 04:42.200]  doesn't want to find al-Qaeda and so they are coming after the American people that's a bright

[08:55.160 --> 09:04.120]  we'll be joining us to talk about the hitlerian doctrine of romans 13 and and how the churches
[09:04.120 --> 09:10.920]  have been turned into engines of politically correct brainwashing so he's going to be joining
[09:10.920 --> 09:15.160]  us in the second hour today for 30 minutes in the last 30 minutes of the third hour
[09:15.800 --> 09:20.920]  new york tv host and syndicated radio host linald who was attacked along with myself and
[09:20.920 --> 09:27.400]  matt drudge last week by keith oberman and a bunch of other individuals for daring
[09:28.920 --> 09:33.800]  you know to question establishment orthodoxy he's going to be joining us to talk about a
[09:33.800 --> 09:41.800]  whole bunch of important news issues and more today and we will have open phones as well
[09:43.800 --> 09:50.280]  in fact i want to take phone calls for first-time callers today to discuss obama's bombing of isis
[09:50.280 --> 09:56.040]  and what's really behind that to get into the escalations in ukraine to get into a stack of
[09:56.040 --> 10:02.760]  news of more political correctness that is being deployed as an authoritarian blanket
[10:02.760 --> 10:09.560]  across the nation also ibm has developed a functioning computer chip with one million
[10:09.560 --> 10:16.680]  neurons that again functions like a human brain that's out of the daily mail that integrates in
[10:16.680 --> 10:27.240]  with a story out of the charlotte cbs affiliate report robots will take over more jobs than they
[10:27.240 --> 10:31.960]  create yes that's the big issue that's how that's being set up and implemented we're going to talk
[10:31.960 --> 10:40.920]  about some of the technocracy at the bottom of the hour we're also going to get into the big
[10:40.920 --> 10:48.920]  developments with the rioting in ferguson that's tied into the obama race baiting promotions via
[10:50.920 --> 10:59.480]  all the propaganda we've seen on msnbc and cnn with trayvon martin that is all coming up today
[11:00.360 --> 11:07.320]  here on this syndicated broadcast i'll give the number out coming up at the start of the next
[11:07.320 --> 11:15.560]  segment in fact let me just move here in the stack from right to left today and begin with
[11:15.560 --> 11:23.160]  what's happening with obama's airstrikes that started last thursday uh against islamic state
[11:23.160 --> 11:32.360]  formerly isis formerly al-qaeda and there are some whoppers today obama says iraq airstrike
[11:32.360 --> 11:39.560]  effort could be long term so the war never ended there now it's back on uh for the foreseeable
[11:39.560 --> 11:48.600]  future and again what is behind that is was set up for the last four years given billions of dollars
[11:48.600 --> 11:59.080]  in eastern syria by turkey by israel by saudi arabia by cutter by nato by france by the british
[11:59.080 --> 12:07.640]  and by the united states on record you can just pull up hundreds of articles in the new york times
[12:07.640 --> 12:12.520]  and even in the council on farm relations admitting that 60 plus percent of the fighters
[12:12.520 --> 12:17.400]  were islamic state and then our media would be like well that's what we need to get behind
[12:17.400 --> 12:23.880]  the nice fighters that only blow up the churches they don't and only cut off the men's heads and
[12:23.880 --> 12:30.120]  rape the women they don't kill the babies and then the the al-qaeda people they even behead the
[12:30.120 --> 12:38.600]  children of the christians uh and of the sunnis not the shia i mean the shia not the sunnis
[12:40.200 --> 12:45.960]  and so they just play on your incredible ignorance and the general's public's ignorance they think
[12:45.960 --> 12:54.120]  that the people that are uh uninformed just have no idea what's even going on and can't find the
[12:54.120 --> 13:03.560]  middle east if the country's even had names on them and so now people ask well why is obama
[13:03.560 --> 13:10.440]  bombing is because they don't completely control it they just funded it helped radicalize it gave
[13:10.440 --> 13:18.760]  it basis is is now even attacking jordan which helped arm them and train them probably more than
[13:18.760 --> 13:28.680]  any other country when it came to physical basis our military was made to tolerate is bases on the
[13:28.680 --> 13:36.760]  border the last three plus years with syria with iraq turkey has given artillery support
[13:36.760 --> 13:45.960]  and shelled the military of syria that has been fighting them for three plus years and that's why
[13:45.960 --> 13:53.000]  a bunch of military officers in the marines the army the air force and the navy all went public
[13:53.000 --> 13:59.560]  last year when we were going to bomb openly the syrian capital and syrian power plants and water
[13:59.560 --> 14:06.280]  treatment and military bases and airports show that al-qaeda could take over it was a big backlash
[14:06.280 --> 14:13.320]  it stunned the globalist completely confused them uh bilderberg was beside itself from our sources
[14:13.320 --> 14:18.120]  is one of the main topics how to spend it and and they decided to spend it by rebranding as isis
[14:18.760 --> 14:25.960]  then as ish they'll probably rename it a couple more times to then confuse everybody and sheet
[14:25.960 --> 14:30.840]  dip al-qaeda and then we pointed out they would then come into iraq when they started attacking
[14:30.840 --> 14:35.320]  four months ago in feluja our military was not allowed to strike back when their convoys came
[14:35.320 --> 14:40.600]  in by the hundreds of vehicles per convoy when the artillery was moved in they were allowed to set up
[14:40.600 --> 14:44.680]  their state so they can't be kicked out but now they've got to be contained when they try to go
[14:44.680 --> 14:52.680]  into Shiite areas in the east and south and in the curd areas in the north and in a special report
[14:52.680 --> 14:59.400]  on this friday that's up on infall wars dot com and prison planet dot com titled obama's bombing of
[14:59.400 --> 15:06.120]  is is a hoax and i want to retweet that at real alex jones right now so folks can sit on onto
[15:06.120 --> 15:11.000]  your friends and family it's a 15 minute video and it breaks down everything that's happening
[15:11.000 --> 15:15.160]  in that video with the documents with the proof even with the mainstream news articles
[15:16.840 --> 15:23.480]  so that's what's happening currently on that front obama says iraq air strike effort could be
[15:23.480 --> 15:31.640]  long term and that's only to bomb them when they try to go into Kurdish areas to the north
[15:31.640 --> 15:38.680]  or when they try to go into south easterly areas in the east that are Shiite and iranian controlled
[15:38.680 --> 15:47.560]  this is the criminal breakup of iraq and the areas mainly where the christians lived in the
[15:47.560 --> 15:55.800]  the traditionally central areas and western areas will now be expunged and the mass murder
[15:55.800 --> 16:01.000]  will continue and you won't see any rioting by christians be they black or white or hispanic
[16:01.000 --> 16:07.480]  across the u.s burning down grocery stores like we're seeing in fergus in missouri uh because
[16:07.480 --> 16:13.400]  hundreds of thousands of christians have and will be now slaughtered have been and are going to be
[16:13.400 --> 16:18.680]  there of course who what would you burn down to protest the fact that our government's arming
[16:18.680 --> 16:23.960]  people and protecting people to murder christians and only now bombing them because they're killing
[16:23.960 --> 16:29.800]  kurd minorities about 10 000 of them hiding up on a mountain which i'm all for bombing isis by the way
[16:31.240 --> 16:36.760]  you notice i'm only for bombing people the globalists created and are protecting i'm never
[16:36.760 --> 16:41.960]  for bombing any of these countries i'm never for attacking libya never for attacking syria
[16:41.960 --> 16:46.920]  never for getting involved with trying to overthrow the egyptian government and put al qaeda
[16:46.920 --> 16:53.800]  basically in charge the muslim brotherhood see the globalists are for the toppling of all those
[16:53.800 --> 16:58.840]  regimes i was against it now they didn't want to bomb isis when their convoys were pouring in four
[16:58.840 --> 17:04.280]  months ago because then they could have been taken out easily now that they're in place
[17:04.280 --> 17:10.200]  you'll have a few bombings of some old broken artillery uh and you know to basically send
[17:10.200 --> 17:15.000]  the message hey don't come here in the backs of your toyotas with your 50 calibers and your
[17:15.000 --> 17:24.120]  stinger missiles or will bomb you see how sick that is a message from isis to the u.s islamist
[17:24.120 --> 17:29.720]  militants tweet gruesome images of dead american soldiers and vow to blow up u.s embassies as
[17:29.720 --> 17:36.760]  terrorist convoy is wiped out in second round of airstrikes but only teaching them you don't
[17:36.760 --> 17:43.480]  get the curd oil basically europe's agreed to get that third and then saudi arabia and others
[17:44.200 --> 17:50.680]  they get the west the iranians get the east and part of the south see this is a deal to break the
[17:50.680 --> 17:56.120]  country up and so isis is being told no no no no no you can kill all the christians you want
[17:56.120 --> 18:00.760]  and all the muslim minorities you want you just can't go into the curd areas okay
[18:00.760 --> 18:09.560]  think about how sick that is and you're not going to hear a word at your glitterbug church
[18:09.560 --> 18:12.440]  your your big mega church about this this week when you go to church
[18:13.480 --> 18:20.440]  clinton blames islamic militants rise on obama french news agency hillary clinton came out and
[18:20.440 --> 18:26.920]  basically said she liked george bush two weeks ago on singing in now she's saying she wouldn't
[18:26.920 --> 18:31.560]  ever open borders like obama's doing now she came out and said well you know we don't need too much
[18:31.560 --> 18:42.040]  more gun control pure baloney she runs obama clinton's run obama on record so this is pure
[18:42.040 --> 18:49.880]  mindless positioning for moron yellow dog cluck's clan southern democrats who want their welfare
[18:49.880 --> 18:59.000]  checks to go vote for hillary that's how dumb they think you are here's another one hillary clinton
[18:59.000 --> 19:05.720]  failure to help syrian rebels led to the rise of isis that's right remember they said we need to
[19:05.720 --> 19:13.000]  have air bombing campaigns of the syrian forces or al qaeda will get a training base in syria
[19:13.000 --> 19:18.200]  and take over the middle east while they were through the turkish ambassador from ben gazi
[19:18.200 --> 19:24.760]  who was there that day giving the heavy weapons the artillery the stinger missiles the tow missiles
[19:24.760 --> 19:32.280]  the chinese red arrows all of it anything the cia could buy hundreds of thousands of machine guns
[19:32.280 --> 19:38.200]  bought from the us shin over there just everything then they think you're so dumb now oh we didn't
[19:38.200 --> 19:44.120]  topple a sod that's why al qaeda is doing this oh i'm sure al qaeda would have been you know not
[19:44.120 --> 19:48.520]  bad at all if they would have got serious see they need them to get a country so they're making a new

[24:36.200 --> 24:46.360]  our consciousness our free will so hillary clinton says that obama didn't do enough to hand syria
[24:46.360 --> 24:52.280]  over to the rebels who were mainly al-qaeda and so because he didn't give enough to al-qaeda
[24:52.280 --> 24:59.000]  that's the reason now al-qaeda's changed its name and taken over much of iraq and is now running
[24:59.000 --> 25:05.880]  around wildly murdering everybody i have photos here today of small children holding up people's
[25:05.880 --> 25:11.720]  heads that have been chopped off in iraq and this has all been part of a strategic plan
[25:11.720 --> 25:21.240]  to shut down any sovereign nation that is sustainable the globalists want to do the very
[25:21.240 --> 25:26.680]  same stuff here they just can't get away with it yet hillary clinton failure to help syrian rebels
[25:26.680 --> 25:32.200]  led to rise of ices that's right and then they give all this twisted logic explaining it and
[25:32.200 --> 25:35.720]  people read the new york times and think they're real smart or read the atlantic and
[25:35.720 --> 25:41.720]  oh you read the new york times oh you're an intellectual laura ingram has come out and
[25:41.720 --> 25:50.120]  said iraq is worse off now than under saddam hussein yeah so why did you support the bipartisan
[25:50.120 --> 26:01.480]  republicans and democrats toppling hussein in 1991 and then in 1999 with the clinton's bombing
[26:01.480 --> 26:11.240]  and then in 2003 and then his capture in 2007 on and on and on she says after 11 years iraq
[26:11.240 --> 26:16.920]  is worse off and then obama's doing a terrible job no he's not but i appreciate you telling
[26:16.920 --> 26:22.840]  part of the truth laura you're a smart lady she's been around a long time wasn't she in
[26:22.840 --> 26:27.160]  the reagan administration she's getting ready to run for office i'd like to be able to support
[26:27.160 --> 26:34.200]  somebody like her she's good on guns and taxes and things but really bad on warmongering did any
[26:34.200 --> 26:40.120]  of these wars turn out good for anybody our troops our country we're in debt and we got a dead million
[26:40.120 --> 26:49.240]  iraqi's plus and that's on our name until we repent of it the iraqis were some of the most
[26:49.240 --> 26:55.800]  pro-western people in the whole middle east folks until we screwed them over for more than two decades
[26:55.800 --> 27:01.400]  and both political parties in the political class are behind it and now they're breaking the country
[27:01.400 --> 27:07.720]  in three parts again given saudi arabia a third iran a third and basically the e u a third and we
[27:07.720 --> 27:15.080]  all paid for it that's what a joke this country's become oh look at this headline on the washington
[27:15.080 --> 27:21.400]  pause so intellectuals can read it and learn about things fighters abandoning al qaeda affiliations
[27:21.400 --> 27:33.320]  to join islamic state us officials say you mean is and isis were are like an al qaeda a new name
[27:33.320 --> 27:41.800]  oh my oh that is very intellectual we told you day one and all this started really about eight
[27:41.800 --> 27:46.280]  months ago when they started taking philuja but four months ago when they dubbed themselves isis
[27:46.280 --> 27:53.480]  that it was al qaeda being globalist funded and directed again think of how sensation only evil
[27:53.480 --> 28:00.520]  that is and the public is so confused that i have so-called intellectuals to stop me on the street
[28:00.520 --> 28:05.800]  or i talk to their talk show hosts are like yeah i really think we ought to be bombing isis alex
[28:05.800 --> 28:10.520]  i s they're really bad why are you criticizing obama he's finally doing something i thought you
[28:10.520 --> 28:17.640]  didn't like those people meanwhile i've been telling people about it before it even started yes i want
[28:17.640 --> 28:23.640]  to bomb isis i want them all dead every stinking last one of them they are a bunch of murdering
[28:23.640 --> 28:33.160]  psychopathic child killing scum but who's more evil the crazy al qaeda isis people where you
[28:33.160 --> 28:39.160]  don't get to join their club unless you're totally out of your mind so the most radical becomes the
[28:39.160 --> 28:44.920]  leader or the globalists that have been protecting and funding them and giving them weapons since
[28:44.920 --> 28:53.240]  1979 was a big duprezinsky and then the next administration of ronald reagan and then george
[28:53.240 --> 29:00.840]  herbert walker bush and then clinton clinton and then bush bush and now obama obama that's what's
[29:00.840 --> 29:07.240]  evil is the corporate globalist interest that are creating full spectrum dominance where they
[29:07.240 --> 29:20.360]  dump out a whole hive of of of wasp or or hornets into your house and then they show up knock on
[29:20.360 --> 29:25.320]  the door five minutes later when you run out of your house or they come in your backyard you want

[36:00.120 --> 36:06.600]  school one of the best in austin two years ago very nice people but they had days twice a year
[36:06.600 --> 36:11.960]  where it was food and video shown of michelle obama telling you what to eat
[36:14.680 --> 36:20.600]  or they didn't get accreditation this is the brainwashing that we're under in this country
[36:20.600 --> 36:24.120]  that's just some of the news that's coming up i want to take your phone calls the toll free
[36:24.120 --> 36:37.800]  number to join us is 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 first time callers 800-259-9231 what do you make
[36:37.800 --> 36:42.600]  of the bombing of isis i'm all for bombing isis so they don't take over the kurdish
[36:42.600 --> 36:48.360]  areas of northern iraq one third of the nation but they were allowed to come in and were not
[36:48.360 --> 36:55.960]  bombed when they were taking over major cities in the west and major oil fields in the last six
[36:55.960 --> 37:01.720]  eight months calling themselves isis the last four and allowed to even advance up to bagdad
[37:03.000 --> 37:06.920]  because they've now been given that area as a permanent state to then carve out
[37:07.960 --> 37:14.920]  half of syria is the new country islamic state and our government helped him do that that was the
[37:14.920 --> 37:21.240]  admitted pentagon plan under brazinski and others wesley clark talked about it five years ago
[37:21.240 --> 37:27.160]  to take over those countries eight of them and then break them all in two to four pieces two three
[37:27.160 --> 37:34.760]  or four pieces and again it's too so destabilization they're not breaking iraq in three pieces i've seen
[37:34.760 --> 37:39.160]  seeing an end go well we'll probably partition the country in three pieces down the road iraq was
[37:39.160 --> 37:44.280]  never supposed to be a country anyways and all the pseudo-intellectuals go yeah so i guess it's okay
[37:44.280 --> 37:50.760]  no it's not okay you get rid of the stabilizing central government it brings people electricity and
[37:50.760 --> 37:58.520]  water after 20 plus years of siege and and war and and over a million dead iraq he's conservatively
[37:59.800 --> 38:04.760]  and his mass war crime the west is committed against him saudi arabia attacks us reportedly on
[38:04.760 --> 38:11.800]  9 11 so we attack iraq on and on and on and on because iraq's the key country in the middle
[38:11.800 --> 38:25.880]  of jordan and syria and lebanon and israel all bordering it and iran and russia and turkey it's
[38:25.880 --> 38:30.920]  right in the middle so the globalists want to control it so they can build proxy armies in it
[38:30.920 --> 38:38.200]  to just absolutely destabilize everything i mean it makes me want to vomit and i i want to get off

[44:27.960 --> 44:32.440]  about the caliphate and msnbc made fun of him we would warn folks about the west funding it as
[44:32.440 --> 44:39.080]  well we would get made fun of oh calls itself the caliphate iraq descends into apocalypse as
[44:39.080 --> 44:48.280]  islamic state fanatics sees towns and tell terrified minority muslims by noon today we will kill all
[44:48.280 --> 44:54.520]  of you what nice people and then obama composes the savior after being right in the middle of the
[44:54.520 --> 45:00.920]  west creating and funding these people creating this new conglomerate and then he can now grandstand
[45:00.920 --> 45:10.520]  and do i saw the footage they did show crisp up close uh infrared gun footage they showed blown
[45:10.520 --> 45:13.960]  out where you couldn't tell what was happening and i looked didn't even look like artillery they
[45:13.960 --> 45:18.600]  were bombing i mean there's thousands of pieces of artillery they've captured from those iraqi
[45:18.600 --> 45:24.120]  bases and they show two pieces of artillery being blown up or they show a couple trucks being blown
[45:24.120 --> 45:29.480]  up i mean i don't even think they're bombing any of these guys they're letting them get strong take
[45:29.480 --> 45:36.840]  over iraq a third of iraq build up their command base and go smashing back into Assad and then
[45:36.840 --> 45:42.440]  hillary says oh yes we've got a bomb Assad to stop them that's how dumb they think we are i mean
[45:42.440 --> 45:47.400]  i mean it is just total twilight zone so i'm done talking about that i want to go your phone calls
[45:50.440 --> 45:53.800]  but first this story is so huge i'm gonna talk about this with chuck balder
[45:54.920 --> 46:01.320]  as members six years ago we got the secret documents from state police officer in Missouri
[46:03.560 --> 46:09.560]  and then we were able to get another document a week later from a federal marshal
[46:09.560 --> 46:15.720]  and to show how bad the surveillance is in this country they found out who the
[46:17.400 --> 46:20.440]  state police guy was and he got in trouble it later blew over
[46:21.480 --> 46:26.120]  and he since got promoted so that's a message about doing the right thing he got in trouble at
[46:26.120 --> 46:32.280]  first but admired by people later and in my experience i didn't do all this because i knew
[46:32.280 --> 46:37.160]  i'd win i did it because my instinct was fight tyranny but i always get heat when i do the
[46:37.160 --> 46:44.440]  right thing from the world from the media from the system at first but as soon as you go through
[46:44.440 --> 46:49.560]  that fire when you do it for the right reasons you you generally get rewarded on the other side
[46:49.560 --> 46:55.320]  folks when you give in to evil you end up getting rewarded up front but hurt later
[46:57.480 --> 47:01.640]  isn't that what the bible says do evil you get rewarded up front get hurt later
[47:01.640 --> 47:08.760]  do the right thing get hurt up front get rewarded later that's just weird logic but that's that
[47:08.760 --> 47:14.280]  that's how it works but the reason i mentioned as it shows the surveillance folks they went and found
[47:14.280 --> 47:25.320]  out where he had faxed it to me and went and sent people in fbi two weeks later they called him in
[47:25.320 --> 47:33.240]  in front of us because he was a he was a supervisor he was mid-level and then here came the fbi
[47:36.280 --> 47:38.040]  saying why did you send that to alex jones
[47:41.880 --> 47:49.560]  and but with the federal marshal he knew how to send it to us snail mail wearing gloves in
[47:49.560 --> 47:55.880]  case they were coming grab it snail mail wearing gloves and you just put a you know different
[47:55.880 --> 48:00.360]  address one that's not yours on the envelope it's like matt drudge said you got to meet in parking
[48:00.360 --> 48:06.760]  garages and back when nsa people and high-level telecom engineers would meet me they would never
[48:06.760 --> 48:12.120]  tell me they were coming they would they wouldn't stalk me they would find out where i lived or
[48:12.120 --> 48:17.240]  they would be waiting in the parking lot or they would come to a public event i was at and then
[48:17.240 --> 48:22.680]  sit in the parking lot waiting and then and then give it to me and they'd be wearing a hat on top
[48:22.680 --> 48:27.480]  of it folks there's a face scanning cameras and they would say wait a few weeks till you report on
[48:27.480 --> 48:33.320]  this and then they would drive off again in their brand new suburb or their brand new Mercedes
[48:34.040 --> 48:40.360]  because these were all senior people that would give me all the intel before anybody else had it
[48:40.360 --> 48:46.520]  and and i i didn't mean to run off into a rabbit trail it's just when i see a headline like this i
[48:46.520 --> 48:51.960]  have flashbacks to the fact that we broke all this uh remember eight years ago the preacher
[48:52.680 --> 48:59.800]  that gave us the secret clergy response team documents he faxed that from one of those uh
[48:59.800 --> 49:08.600]  mailbox places mailbox etc type places and we posted the documents where they had hired most
[49:08.600 --> 49:13.400]  the preachers in the country to work for the FBI or the CIA and even given them rainwashing
[49:13.400 --> 49:18.120]  manuals the big mega churches name it and claim it how to condition and manipulate the public
[49:18.120 --> 49:22.200]  but even small churches have it and to give them faith-based initiative money started under bush
[49:22.200 --> 49:31.560]  but accelerated under obama and they came in a week later to the hospital where he was an
[49:31.560 --> 49:37.720]  administrator he had a church on the side pretty good sized church and said uh we're gonna get you
[49:37.720 --> 49:46.120]  fired from the hospital and they got him fired from the hospital for separately giving us those
[49:46.120 --> 49:55.400]  documents i mean what what an evil government ladies and gentlemen for letting you know what
[49:55.400 --> 50:03.000]  obama now says publicly obama says extremist ideology that's taken over the gop balkanization
[50:03.000 --> 50:08.120]  the media has blocked my agenda yeah what did clinton say on the white house documents that
[50:08.120 --> 50:13.560]  came out a few months ago from the from his library that uh they were able to get through
[50:13.560 --> 50:18.440]  four-year request the western journalism senator joseph farrah that we can't let the public ever
[50:18.440 --> 50:23.400]  have their own media we got to discredit any media that isn't controlled by us calling them
[50:23.400 --> 50:29.000]  conspiracy theorists and he goes on to say that radicals have taken over the republican party
[50:29.000 --> 50:32.280]  and that they're basically extremists and that they're the biggest threat to the country
[50:32.280 --> 50:37.000]  we'll see what homeland security says they're preparing with the tanks with the armor with
[50:37.000 --> 50:45.400]  the police for war against the people that want to save this nation you understand that and they're
[50:45.400 --> 50:50.200]  going to blow stuff up and blame it on us this assures the sun came up we're trying to stop them
[50:50.200 --> 50:56.120]  by exposing their game plan folks this isn't this isn't a joke this isn't a game this is really

[56:09.560 --> 56:14.200]  it's now in a major government study so all that and more coming up let's go to your phone calls
[56:14.200 --> 56:19.800]  jessie chris from lisa fred welding and others uh let's go to jessie in texas you're on the air
[56:19.800 --> 56:26.360]  thanks for calling hey alex how are you doing good brother go ahead thank you for having me on
[56:26.360 --> 56:32.040]  air man something that i wanted to bring up uh and bring attention to was i was looking last night
[56:32.040 --> 56:38.520]  on twitter and the hashtag a message from ices to us uh i don't know it's something that's been
[56:38.520 --> 56:43.480]  freaking me out i mean i i spent like a good 30 minutes looking at at the tweets from ices
[56:44.120 --> 56:49.320]  and these guys are like you know i don't know if these are hoaxes or not but they're already
[56:49.320 --> 56:55.240]  taking pictures apparently within the u.s and saying we are everywhere we're here and then
[56:55.240 --> 57:00.520]  they're oh no this is a major radical islamic revolution funded by the globalist and i mean
[57:00.520 --> 57:04.600]  i meant to get on the phone with paul this weekend and say what you're saying and i don't want to be
[57:04.600 --> 57:09.800]  a drama queen either but one reason i'm getting really mad is there are well-known websites
[57:09.800 --> 57:14.440]  that have been attacking me for years that are openly promoting ices and saying they're part of it
[57:15.000 --> 57:20.600]  and so we even have ices groups people affiliated with it threatening us right now and i'm really
[57:20.600 --> 57:25.240]  getting sick of it man our government lets a bunch of these people in they're running all over us
[57:25.240 --> 57:31.320]  and then they use the threat of their people to then create a police state to point it at ron paul
[57:31.320 --> 57:37.560]  and alex jones and matt drudge and and and and the free press it makes me want to vomit in fact
[57:37.560 --> 57:42.520]  let me get paul on the phone right now i meant to do that uh because i saw the tweets that our
[57:42.520 --> 57:47.400]  government allows ices remember a month ago oh we need to let ices keep tweeting we track them that
[57:47.400 --> 57:54.760]  way give me a break folks uh again if you were obama and the globalist how do you take over
[57:54.760 --> 58:01.160]  america you fund a terrorist group let them attack us and then take our freedom when you run the group
[58:01.160 --> 58:06.680]  how sick is that does that make you angry tell us it does i mean these guys they've been tweeting
[58:06.680 --> 58:12.600]  like you know 9 11 part 2 coming soon like that's that's not funny man like you know anything could
[58:12.600 --> 58:18.920]  probably have had enough of it i tell you it makes me mad makes me want to really i'm just getting
[58:18.920 --> 58:25.480]  sick of it and of course the public has no idea our government is funding it because it's not our
[58:25.480 --> 58:30.040]  government it's globalist offshore banks that want to bring the country down that's why the border's
[58:30.040 --> 58:35.640]  wide open and obama can activate his operatives through alsharp than others and have the inner
[58:35.640 --> 58:40.840]  city folks burn everything down at the same time this this could be it i'm telling you folks they're
[58:40.840 --> 58:47.880]  winding everything up operation chaos to bring this country down anybody can see it it's asymmetrical
[58:47.880 --> 58:54.120]  warfare from the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself our world is becoming
[58:54.120 --> 58:59.240]  more and more toxic each and every day but it's not just the air outside that's toxic indoor air
[58:59.240 --> 59:03.560]  has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor
[59:03.560 --> 59:09.000]  air and most americans spend 90 of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes

[01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:39.000]  borders government funding isis isis then bombing them when they get out of areas they're not supposed
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:44.600]  to enter it's kind of like painting by colors they tell al-qaeda where they're supposed to attack
[01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:50.200]  change their names the public doesn't figure it out oh you got outside the lines slap your wrist
[01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:57.080]  it's just insane look at the headlines on info wars dot com i haven't even gotten into the riots

[01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:10.840]  calls lisa in california you're on the air go ahead hi alex happy monday happy full moon i think
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:16.760]  we are seeing the effects of it what a crazy weekend it's really hard to watch my town burn
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:22.200]  from berguson that area grew up there and you know they've been race baiting that area
[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:28.680]  probably for 20 years um started back in high school and we had a really nice new high school
[01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:34.200]  and they started busing in all the inner city kids to our high school caused all kinds of
[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:38.840]  problems they didn't want to be there we didn't i mean we welcome them but you know then there was
[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:47.080]  vandalism and all kinds of chaos uh bathrooms torn up the stall doors missing um you know
[01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:52.680]  i couldn't walk down the hall in a skirt without getting it flipped up it was just horrible and
[01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:59.000]  i think i'm seeing that sort of played out now and it reminds me of the open borders
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:05.080]  where you know we're bringing in people who aren't going to appreciate it here the natives or whatever
[01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:11.560]  we are aren't going to appreciate them and it just sets up this whole horrible chaotic situation
[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:16.600]  and it really makes me sad to see um and then you know i guess you saw the militarized vehicles
[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:22.040]  coming down the street and it it's just off the chain absolutely horrible i don't know how to
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:28.680]  fix it but i think it's a really a long time coming no i hear you and and of course those those
[01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:34.360]  tanks those are bradley fighting vehicles uh we're being sent to homeland security base uh people
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:38.280]  saw the tanks on the train rolling through and thought oh they're here to save us no no no no
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:44.120]  no those are for the tea party not for people burning down buildings and looting the shops
[01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:50.040]  so uh and now trevon martin's lawyer is going to take over and go race bait the entire deal
[01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:54.680]  uh after a black youth was shot and again uh
[01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:01.400]  who even needs the military when all these militarized police showed up
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:07.240]  with the armored vehicles and the rest of it but then basically stood there while the people looted
[01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:12.600]  and and rioted and you know you also notice they always loot corporate stores because nobody's
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:18.040]  going to protect them just like uh what happened in the in the la riots the the korean shops
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:21.160]  they were privately owned didn't get loaded because people went there with shotguns
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:25.320]  for shooting people and see if somebody was trying to loot my operation
[01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:31.800]  i would simply wait till they knock the door down and then we'll be waiting with shotguns
[01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:37.640]  and 223s and 308s on the other side we're going to defend our property and so that's the answer i
[01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:43.000]  mean if people were looting my business uh the minute they cross the threshold they would get
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:50.120]  justice there on the spot but uh it is it is just unspeakable uh the type of stuff that's going on
[01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:56.200]  and then people wonder why businesses end up leaving the neighborhoods uh but it this has
[01:03:56.200 --> 01:04:02.840]  all been sold as acceptable uh and the entire country is a time bomb can you imagine what
[01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:07.880]  will happen lisa if the welfare checks when the country uh starts breaking down if the dollar goes
[01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:15.640]  belly up stop showing up or stop having the same purchasing value oh it's awful and i think that
[01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:19.880]  you know somebody said if these people had a job to go to this morning they may not have
[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:24.760]  been out all night last night carrying up the count you know it's it's really sad it's just
[01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:30.440]  awful to see um and i don't know how to fix it people have to stand together and somebody else
[01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:35.320]  said you know oh my gosh when the kids funeral happens you know what's going to happen to the
[01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:41.640]  town is everyone gonna erupt and go crazy then i i don't know where does it end so that's that and

[01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:48.360]  technocracy ibm develops a computer chip with one million neurons that functions like a human brain
[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:56.280]  and that dovetails with a new report out by the pew research project and a major university
[01:08:56.280 --> 01:09:05.480]  with connections to DARPA that robots will take over jobs and displace humans well that's because
[01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:10.920]  the architecture of the new political financial economic structures being built to end humans
[01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:19.000]  as we know it that's on record from MIT stanford bill joy google i mean the course has been set
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:24.440]  that's how i know what's coming when we have victories and hold it off people say oh it's
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:31.080]  it's some of it's happening but not all of it as we try to hold the gate against this as we try to
[01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:41.480]  build a future for humans not a eugenics technocracy based system the unwashed masses just scream
[01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:49.240]  begging to be destroyed give us our nascar give us our nfl give us our political correctness our

[01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:08.200]  i'm gonna go to welden and fred and chris and then today or later but i want to finish up with lisa
[01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:12.760]  lisa said that have you just joined us i held her over that she was from fergus and we're
[01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:16.760]  going to break that down as well today the rioting the looting the rest of it and things to come
[01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:22.920]  um stories are up on info wars dot com but she said hey i'm a vet tech since it's back to school
[01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:30.840]  and we've got all the vaccines and things happening and she said that we just joined us that vaccines
[01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:36.520]  are the same thing to animals they do to the kids well see i worked for a small animal vet for two
[01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:44.680]  years from the time i was about 13 to 15 then i got a car and i was sent for a year to live on the
[01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:49.240]  ranch because i was getting a lot of fights and stuff i was just taking out of school almost for
[01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:54.280]  a whole year in a summer and i worked for a large animal vet who i worked for in some summers before
[01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:59.720]  but i worked for him straight through and he would tell people well they recommend shots every year
[01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:04.680]  but well i think it messes them up we see all sorts of problems when we vaccinate dogs and cats every
[01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:10.920]  year i know it's recommended well since then it's changed where it's every three years or so
[01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:19.480]  because the vets themselves had a backlash and uh you want ulcers you want eczema on your cats
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:25.400]  and dogs you want them to have health problems uh you want them to get really bad allergies
[01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:30.520]  you want them to get epilepsy now i don't know what she's gonna say yet i but i she says she's a
[01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:37.080]  vet tech and you know i'm gonna have a recap i know vaccines are bad folks i know the four years
[01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:44.680]  running every year in august into september it causes whooping cough outbreaks in california
[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:50.200]  and other states when they give the m m r and other vaccines and the whooping cough vaccine
[01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:57.400]  and it comes out in the newsletter the vaccine does it i know what the hepatitis shots doing babies
[01:11:57.400 --> 01:12:01.960]  i know medical doctors refuse to take them i know okay because my dad's an oral surgeon
[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:06.360]  i know a lot of medical doctors so i'm not medically ignorant
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:14.040]  see obama said that people that are anti-establishment read only what we want to read bull i read
[01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:20.120]  everything i'm not in some echo chamber it's you the authoritarians that are i know let me
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:26.200]  tell you something i've cut myself out ranching before and had stuff that might have tetanus in
[01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:31.080]  it because you're around horse manure that's where it grows and i haven't gone and gotten a tetanus
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:35.880]  shot i've had a puncture wound i've stuck a knife in there and had that sucker bleed and if the
[01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:40.120]  tetanus shots weren't filled with other stuff i'd go get one but that's one of their favorite
[01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:45.880]  vaccines to add other hormones to to manipulate male and female genetics and they've been caught
[01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:52.280]  doing it in secret test in africa and india and the us i'm not taking a tetanus shot
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:59.560]  even though it risked my life i want to take that shot i want good medicine i don't want to be
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:05.400]  screwed with by a government jack and stuff into the vaccines you know why is it hurting the dogs
[01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:09.960]  and cats too because there's no oversight of vaccines they all have immunity they cook them in
[01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:15.960]  big giant tanks at the big vaccine manufacturing facilities up in michigan and lansing that's
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:22.680]  where they make the vaccine they spray on meat that's a live virus that eats bacteria it's a
[01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:27.240]  wonder we're not all dead yet you know what else they cook in those tanks they use the same tanks
[01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:32.200]  that they make vaccines and other batches they then reset the tanks and make other vaccines in them
[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:41.960]  they oh it's devilish it's demonic folks it is beyond just them tailoring stuff in the vaccines
[01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:44.840]  to hurt people they just do whatever they want
[01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:53.000]  like it's a random gambling or something just to see how we mutate i'm sorry i'm ranting i get so
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:57.800]  angry about it think about all the kids right now that are getting shot up with dozens of vaccines
[01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:02.440]  and having epileptic seizures they'll they'll usually have a thousand kids getting vaccinated
[01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:06.040]  the big city vaccination campaign oh can we get your free vaccines we're gonna rest it
[01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:12.360]  there's there's no law you don't get arrested it's all just hoaxes they'll have dozens and
[01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:18.120]  dozens of kids that have epileptic seizures on the spot no they just they just had a bad reaction
[01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:22.840]  no big deal imagine babies being shot up with that sorry lisa i'm ranting them we're going
[01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:26.200]  to our guests and back to your calls what do you want to tell us about the vaccines
[01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:33.480]  well i love listening to you um you know the yearly vaccines haven't been phased out they did go
[01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:39.800]  to three years but then there was a big pushback um against them and they said no we have to leave
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:43.800]  it up to your veterinarian so many people get that card in the mail every year and they think oh
[01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:48.840]  gosh i've got to go get puffy her shot you know i'm a good owner well then you're going to get a tumor
[01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:53.800]  at the injection site you are going to get epilepsy you will have allergies you'll have bad ears you'll
[01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:58.840]  have a just a bunch of different problems but there is a way to push back you always talk about
[01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:04.920]  what can we do to fight back there is a tighter test that you can ask for instead of the yearly
[01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:10.200]  vaccine i work for the biggest stars in hollywood actually i'm in LA now and do you think they get
[01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:16.920]  their animals yearly shots uh no and most of them don't vaccinate their kids either by the way um
[01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:23.160]  but you can go and get a tighter test measure the immunity level in your pet and they have found the

[01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:25.320]  important subject he looked right at me and he said but the end justifies the means statistically
[01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:30.200]  there's less diseases and things because we do this but we do cover up that it's hurting people
[01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:36.200]  because of the it'll make folks not get them and i said actually i've seen the statistics hygiene and
[01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:43.080]  running water and better food by the 20s in the west made the diseases go down vaccines come in
[01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:48.760]  in the 40s and disease goes back up just not as high as the level the pre 20s level and he goes
[01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:55.720]  yeah i've read that too but you know what it's just got to be done and i go it's got to be done
[01:17:55.720 --> 01:18:03.240]  because it's your job and he just said hey man i got to go do not tell people my name
[01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:11.400]  and i went look the guy up and pretty sure enough he was just insane he works at the state health
[01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:17.160]  department right here in austin and i mean look look i'm just telling the public they have these
[01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:21.400]  hoaxes i appreciate your calling me i'm incredible you ought to do a youtube disguising your name or

[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:30.760]  get her on as a whistleblower people listen when you call it a whistleblower i mean she's not really
[01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:34.600]  a whistleblower she's just telling her testimony but people listen when you say it's a whistleblower
[01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:39.640]  because they act like warning people's illegal nowadays so i guess it is a whistleblower but
[01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:45.160]  they sit there in fear monger and tell you it's the law you'll be arrested if you don't vaccinate

[01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:19.640]  the balance of the hour a little bit in the next is pastor chuck boldwin and his last column was his
[01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:27.080]  most read ever and we're going to repost it right now to info wars dot com dealing with the pastors
[01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:35.320]  deliberately misleading their flocks and to me more and more this is the big issue because you'll
[01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:39.320]  have a lot of good rhetoric in these big mega churches even small ones but they're getting
[01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:47.720]  state-run information to get the faith-based initiative money and that's why they won't
[01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:52.360]  go out and stop abortion they won't criticize obama they won't do anything but if you're a
[01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:57.480]  quote liberal church you can say gd america and you know all the rest of it and let's turn our
[01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:03.080]  guns in that that's okay so to fight back against this is pastor chuck boldwin he's been fighting
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:07.160]  hard for a long time he came out with his best-selling book a few years ago that we sell at info
[01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:13.320]  war store dot com we're ten percent off everything until next week back to school special roman's 13
[01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:23.400]  the true meaning of submission second edition with timothy baldwin his son and more i'm going
[01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:27.320]  from memory in timothy a constitutional lawyer i can't remember he's a great interview as well
[01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:31.960]  pastor baldwin this is a short segment long segment coming up i want to get into the initiative
[01:26:31.960 --> 01:26:38.120]  some now but then mainly into why we need this initiative and plug the website it's a beautiful
[01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:42.520]  new site and i know this initiative is already exploding even though you just announced it
[01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:46.920]  because the people are ready to be let out of egypt right now as soon as they learn they're
[01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:52.680]  actually in a government temple with a government operative up there on the balcony making them all
[01:26:52.680 --> 01:27:00.040]  feel good i have a feeling this whole facade is going to crumble hey thank you're exactly right
[01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:05.240]  and and yeah my son is the constitutional attorney and he and i wrote the book on roman's 13 to
[01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:11.000]  defunct this uh ridiculous theory that christians are supposed to submit to government no matter
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:16.040]  what and they use roman's 13 as the predicate for that and of course it's erroneous say the
[01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:21.480]  least so we expose all that scriptually using both the old and the new testament to prove
[01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:27.800]  categorically that nowhere does god expect his people to submit the tyranny no matter what
[01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:33.960]  uh government they say contrary uh but the column you referred to is george barna just
[01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:40.600]  came out with some fantastic research a two-year project where that he was studying the uh the
[01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:45.800]  churches and their political involvement and if they were not involved why not and as a result
[01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:51.400]  of the survey he he released some information i thought was really fascinating one of which was
[01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:58.520]  that 90 percent of the pastors uh told him in the research that they knew they knew
[01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:04.040]  that the bible spoke to all of these political issues that we're dealing with today as a country
[01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:11.640]  and yet they refuse to deal with those issues now to me that was a staggering revelation
[01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:15.960]  because usually what you'll hear these peace preachers say is that well
[01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:19.320]  they god hadn't called me to preach on that i'm just supposed to preach the gospel
[01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:24.520]  these things aren't relevant to the bible you know pick the subject it doesn't matter the
[01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:29.320]  scripture is silent on these issues and that's what a lot of times you will hear but the survey
[01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:36.680]  said that they know they know that the bible speaks to all of these issues but they are
[01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:42.760]  not going to address them because they're controversial which means that they are deliberately
[01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:51.080]  refusing to address the truth they are they are choosing to not tell their people the truth
[01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:55.800]  they know what they're doing that it's not ignorant a lot of times you'll be like well
[01:28:55.800 --> 01:29:00.920]  pat my pastor would you know he just he just doesn't realize what's going on he is premeditated
[01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:07.320]  deception exactly which ups the crime and god's eyes up big time i i agree with that totally it
[01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:13.480]  is premeditated deception this was a this was a fascinating revelation so now we can throw
[01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:19.080]  ignorance out forever as an excuse as to why these preachers are not willing to deal with the issues
[01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:23.080]  to tell the people what's going on this is huge we're going to break down your column
[01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:27.720]  and the cure to it when we come back we're having the column reposted right now
[01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:34.120]  to info wars dot com will tweet it out state run churches caught red-handed is what we're

[01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:20.680]  the state run church's article to the top of info wars dot com in the featured news it just went
[01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:26.840]  live about 20 seconds ago i'm told so folks need to hit refresh on info wars dot com i'm also going
[01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:31.880]  to put your column out on facebook we're going to send it out right now on twitter a tweet that for
[01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:39.400]  me as well guys this national survey and in two years of research confirming the preachers know
[01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:45.880]  that they are deceiving people about what's happening and again the first amendment clearly says
[01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:50.920]  congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free
[01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:56.680]  exercise thereof or the press and then it goes on to the rest of it so how did the churches get to
[01:35:56.680 --> 01:36:03.800]  the point of saying hey you can't say abortions wrong hey you can't say obama's a liar hey you
[01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:09.240]  can't say funding al qaeda is wrong you just i mean i've talked to people from baptist churches
[01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:14.520]  that have friends of mine that have given me the printouts where they tell them when you go to any
[01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:20.040]  bible luncheon or you go to any uh you know retreat or anything don't talk about politics or
[01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:26.200]  were in violation of 501c3 so they've migrated that now from the preacher being a state run church
[01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:34.520]  front man or woman down now to you're not even supposed to talk about anything with anybody
[01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:40.200]  from the church i mean these are now state run cults and if a tree fell and nobody heard it did
[01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:46.120]  it make a sound i talked to these preachers some of these you know big mega church preachers and
[01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:49.800]  i'll say hey are you part of clergy response team and they'll go for me and all fake and nice to
[01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:56.760]  like hey i can't talk to you so that a lot of them it's beyond just being scared they are knowing
[01:36:56.760 --> 01:37:03.400]  agents of the state they think that secures them not being messed with with the irs they ought to
[01:37:03.400 --> 01:37:07.400]  be worried about god they ought to be worried about what this country is turning into even if
[01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:11.960]  they don't even believe in god and they're just a fake preacher there to make money a lot of mar
[01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:17.160]  shouldn't they be worried about where this country is going pastor break it down for folks well
[01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:22.600]  you're exactly right and at the end of the column i mentioned the part of the survey where
[01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:28.760]  that you just alluded to where that they asked the survey question at the end that i that i
[01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:36.440]  relate is you know what is the reason for this and in the article i i exposed how that 90 percent
[01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:42.440]  of the pastors that were surveyed indicate that they know that the bible speaks to these
[01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:48.760]  salient issues that you deal with every day and so do i but they refuse to deal with them
[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:55.720]  because they're controversial and in the article it also points out the five measures of success
[01:37:56.280 --> 01:38:03.400]  that the pastors look to to determine uh the success of their work and and those five items
[01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:11.080]  are attendance giving number of programs number of staff and square footage of their building
[01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:15.640]  that's the things they look to as far as they're concerned that's the measure of their success
[01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:20.600]  you know it's amazing to me that uh they have nothing in there of you know if i were to find
[01:38:20.600 --> 01:38:25.480]  that in the book of act where do you find that in the early church where do you find any that
[01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:32.920]  in the bible whatsoever attendance giving number of programs number of staff square footage so
[01:38:32.920 --> 01:38:42.360]  anything that they think is going to diminish any one of those five item success uh uh items
[01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:48.840]  are going to be avoided like the plague by these pastors and so they refuse to deal with the issues
[01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:53.240]  even though they know that they are biblically faith now to me that was a great revelation
[01:38:53.240 --> 01:38:58.280]  because now we're not talking about ignorance we're talking about deliberate disobedience
[01:38:58.280 --> 01:39:01.720]  so when you get down to the bottom of the article and you say okay what was the number
[01:39:01.720 --> 01:39:07.160]  one reason why the pastors refuse to deal with the issues outside of the fact that it's
[01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:15.880]  controversial and it may interfere with their success and you got it the 501c3 irs tax exempt
[01:39:15.880 --> 01:39:23.560]  status turning churches into nonprofit charity corporation so now we see where that it's more
[01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:29.560]  than just the fear of not being successful it's more than just all right i may lose people i may
[01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:36.280]  lose giving you know i may lose that my success rate uh among the community it's more than that
[01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:43.560]  now it's fear of losing tax exempt status fear of losing the contributions that may result
[01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:49.640]  from the loss of the tax exempt status so of course this goes back to 1954 when lbj then
[01:39:49.640 --> 01:39:56.280]  senator introduced this monster into the senate it became law now we've been dealing with it for
[01:39:56.280 --> 01:40:02.600]  all these years and of course it's evolved to what it is today and what it is today is a
[01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:11.720]  an ax that's being held over the necks of the pastors intimidating them from saying anything
[01:40:11.720 --> 01:40:17.960]  that might be deemed political and as you know especially on the so-called conservative side
[01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:27.320]  of the issue so that they will be silenced as a church which is the greatest opportunity the greatest
[01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:33.160]  force or good in the country is the pulpits of america we knew that where would america be alex
[01:40:33.160 --> 01:40:40.680]  without the black regiment pastors of colonial america in 1775 and 1770 where would we have been
[01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:45.560]  there would have been no hunker hill there would have been no shot fired around the world there
[01:40:45.560 --> 01:40:49.240]  there would have been no declaration of independence there would have been no separation from great
[01:40:49.240 --> 01:40:55.000]  britain it all began from the patriot pulpits in america where the pastors were speaking out for
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:41:01.400]  freedom and liberty and showing them the biblical reasons for this but this is not just something
[01:41:01.400 --> 01:41:07.720]  that's a political issue but this is a spiritual issue the bible issue and here's why chapter
[01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:14.280]  and verse here's the principle here's the doctrine and they taught those issues to the people so that
[01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:21.320]  when the time came for those gallant men to stand on lexington green was just outside the church house
[01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:26.680]  at the church of lexington where most of those men worshiped every sunday with their muskets in hand
[01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:32.760]  in the early morning hours of april 1975 and with students of british said eight men immediately
[01:41:32.760 --> 01:41:37.960]  lost their lives from the british open fire and our revolutionary war began that could have never
[01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:45.240]  happened except that pastor jones clark pastor the church of lexington had for years and years
[01:41:45.240 --> 01:41:50.760]  taught his men these fundamental principles of liberty that's right and the british newspapers
[01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:55.560]  is i know you're writing your book but i've looked it up it's on record cursed what they called the
[01:41:55.560 --> 01:42:01.480]  black brigades and they knew full well who led the american revolution absolutely and they gave
[01:42:01.480 --> 01:42:06.760]  due credit they do that's why they call them the black regiment because they saw them as the leaders
[01:42:06.760 --> 01:42:12.280]  of the rebellion of the of the fight for revolution and they knew that the pastors were the one that
[01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:17.320]  were giving them the moral and the spiritual inspiration to do what needed to be done so what
[01:42:17.320 --> 01:42:22.520]  do we not have today that they had then i mean there's a lot of things that are exciting going
[01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:27.480]  on the enemy knew what to do they captured the church that's right turned it into a government
[01:42:27.480 --> 01:42:34.120]  instrument that's right that's what we don't have we don't have the patriot pulpit alex
[01:42:34.120 --> 01:42:37.720]  and that's the whole purpose of my initiative to build the church project
[01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:42.920]  which it took me two months to launch but now we have the money to do it and we're launching
[01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:49.400]  the application form is live people around the country who want to start a non 501c 3 church
[01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:54.120]  can go to the website they can fill out the application and we can begin the process of
[01:42:54.120 --> 01:43:01.400]  trying to go around the country and help these people start fresh new non 501c 3 churches and
[01:43:01.400 --> 01:43:07.400]  get this there's a lot of pastors around the country ordained ministers hundreds of them that
[01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:14.200]  i know of who are wanting a congregation that's not 501c 3 you got to remember that there's a lot
[01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:20.520]  of these pastors whose eyes have awakened as well alex and they're wanting to get out of that 501c
[01:43:20.520 --> 01:43:26.680]  3 system and they want to find a group of people that are willing to have a non 501c 3 church and
[01:43:26.680 --> 01:43:32.360]  they you know if we can get together these ministers kind of like a a glorified e harmony
[01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:37.800]  dot com you know where we're matching these independent pastors that are willing to speak
[01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:44.120]  out on the issue and these people that are tired sick and tired of these 501c 3 churches where the
[01:43:44.120 --> 01:43:49.560]  pastors refuse to say anything from the pulpit controversial and get these people together
[01:43:49.560 --> 01:43:56.040]  so that they can start some brand new non 501c 3 churches and you're right also alex when you said
[01:43:56.040 --> 01:44:01.480]  that this could change the country because the way the pulpits go the way that the church goes
[01:44:01.480 --> 01:44:05.160]  is the way that the nation goes and if we get over the next several years
[01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:13.960]  make so that there could be hundreds hundreds of brand new non 501c 3 churches starting up
[01:44:13.960 --> 01:44:19.000]  people beginning to get aware the message is going out people are coming in i mean it could be
[01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:24.360]  revolutionary that the that the hope of america has never been in the white house it's always been
[01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:30.440]  in the church house and if you look at the last 50 years since the cia on record took over the
[01:44:30.440 --> 01:44:37.960]  big churches and pushed the mega church agenda and use it as a front and others it's all it's
[01:44:37.960 --> 01:44:45.480]  been about turn them into self-help motivational speakers who go in and make everybody feel good
[01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:51.720]  and then make the preacher a deity and then turn it into a big social club where there's a country
[01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:57.000]  club at the church and everybody vacations with the church when you do business with the church
[01:44:57.800 --> 01:45:02.920]  and i guess you cheat on your wife at the church i mean really they just become country clubs
[01:45:03.880 --> 01:45:09.960]  and and and you know literally up there just to push the establishment line
[01:45:12.280 --> 01:45:19.320]  just to make a bunch of people feel good and i've done an analysis of this you go back to the
[01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:23.720]  Rockefeller foundation the world council of churches the national council of churches
[01:45:23.720 --> 01:45:28.280]  the ecumenical movement all of it you go from the conservative churches that aren't involved
[01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:34.280]  politically now to the so-called leftist churches man they are billa melinda gates eugenics world
[01:45:34.280 --> 01:45:42.040]  government open borders take the crosses out new age i mean i've been to the big churches in austin
[01:45:42.040 --> 01:45:47.640]  the big leftist churches and i mean it is frightening just like every disney movie the
[01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:55.240]  leaders a woman men are bad well the preachers are all women and obamas jesus and uh i mean they
[01:45:55.240 --> 01:45:59.240]  really know what they're doing and you because i've gone and watched it and you go watch these
[01:45:59.240 --> 01:46:05.240]  preachers they know what they're doing these are agents of the state running shy ops and we even
[01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:11.240]  have the documents i mean i mean that's the issue here folks is that america is falling look at how
[01:46:11.240 --> 01:46:16.760]  they've got mainline baptist charities promoting open borders and to bring the illegals up right and
[01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:21.640]  then and then the churches get six thousand dollars for every three kids that are making money off of
[01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:26.680]  it these are pure businesses well i want to cover topics with you now but first give out the website
[01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:31.960]  we've got it on screen chuck bolden live dot com there's a link there but how do folks find the
[01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:37.480]  liberty church project well if they go on liberty church project dot com liberty church project
[01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:43.240]  dot com right liberty church project dot com we're going to tweak that address out as well it's in
[01:46:43.240 --> 01:46:48.760]  your column that we just reposted to info wars dot com but i want to cover the waterfront look at
[01:46:48.760 --> 01:46:55.720]  the judgment against america look at how the floodgates are opening i believe and i can feel it
[01:46:55.720 --> 01:47:03.000]  that the hedge or like a gate or castle walls have now fallen about 30 percent and i've been
[01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:06.440]  describing this the last few years as they're down 10 percent they're down 20 percent now they're
[01:47:06.440 --> 01:47:12.440]  down to 30 and now they're falling fast in the next few years al-qaeda is being openly funded and
[01:47:12.440 --> 01:47:18.120]  protected the borders are wide open world governments being announced um obama and the
[01:47:18.120 --> 01:47:25.000]  executive is operating by executive fee out on every front new fines fees regulations global taxes
[01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:34.040]  the flood of evil is coming in and i wanted you to speak to that uh to the borders to just just
[01:47:34.040 --> 01:47:39.640]  everything that's happening right now yeah well and that's it is it not the job of the pastor to be
[01:47:39.640 --> 01:47:45.560]  the watchman on the wall i mean alex this is the thing to just bug the stew out of me the whole
[01:47:45.560 --> 01:47:53.000]  concept of the shepherd the minister is that he's a watchman on the wall he is the man that stands
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:48:00.120]  up in the pulpit sunday by sunday and warns his people the flock the sheep of the church of the
[01:48:00.120 --> 01:48:06.440]  danger of the impending world no matter what that might be you know it could be a local issue it could
[01:48:06.440 --> 01:48:12.200]  be a strictly a spiritual issue within the congregation or it could be a community issue
[01:48:12.200 --> 01:48:17.320]  it could be a national issue like you're describing this border issue right now i mean and you're
[01:48:17.320 --> 01:48:24.760]  right they use the the churches to fulfill the agenda that they have and in the border situation
[01:48:24.760 --> 01:48:32.120]  we see this constantly whether using the pastors and churches to promote the open border concept
[01:48:32.120 --> 01:48:38.680]  and and the average pastor who in his heart knows right from wrong and he knows that it's harmful to
[01:48:38.680 --> 01:48:45.640]  his country he knows it's harmful to his grandkids he knows harmful to freedom and yet because of his
[01:48:45.640 --> 01:48:53.080]  fear of the 501c3 taxes of status his fear of losing attendance offering his fear of
[01:48:53.800 --> 01:48:58.120]  of maybe not being able to build the bigger building and let's not forget this too a lot of
[01:48:58.120 --> 01:49:04.840]  these churches are head over heels in debt they are up to their eyeballs in indebtedness and if
[01:49:04.840 --> 01:49:11.240]  they have a five to ten percent disruption in income they are really going to feel it i mean to tell
[01:49:11.240 --> 01:49:16.600]  you they are just to the to the max in debt and so they're out there looking at the crowd and say
[01:49:16.600 --> 01:49:21.320]  you know if i say something controversial i may i may lose five percent of my crowd five percent
[01:49:21.320 --> 01:49:26.360]  of my giving i can't meet the payroll i've got staff i've got insurance i got retirement benefits
[01:49:26.360 --> 01:49:32.440]  now i've got all these obligations uh financials you deal with and so they have got themselves in
[01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:37.160]  a place and they don't want to speak out because of all these factors combined so the result is
[01:49:37.160 --> 01:49:43.800]  one out they're not watchmen anymore they're it's not a church it's not a church it's a self-help
[01:49:43.800 --> 01:49:47.880]  country club and the whole country is going to elin and basket eleven o'clock on sunday morning
[01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:53.400]  in the average church you know what it is alec it's christian happy hour that's exactly what it is
[01:49:53.400 --> 01:50:00.040]  it's christian happy hour and we've lost the truth we've lost the entire principle of truth
[01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:05.160]  and the reason is is that that's one of the reasons i think the one of the biggest reasons is the 501
[01:50:05.160 --> 01:50:06.680]  501 501 501 501 501 501 501 501 501 501 501 501 501 501 501 501 501 501 501 501 501 501 501 501 501 501
[01:50:06.680 --> 01:50:11.640]  and that's why i mean this what i've been doing what i'm doing now is the result of like over a
[01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:18.280]  year of deliberation and prayer and how can i do that what can i do and people were calling me and
[01:50:18.280 --> 01:50:24.120]  writing me all the time chuck what can we do this is it no this is huge this strikes right at the
[01:50:24.120 --> 01:50:30.760]  root of it right at the heart of it and the churches have been conned people want a mission people
[01:50:30.760 --> 01:50:35.800]  want leadership people want the challenge they want to hear how bad it is because they already
[01:50:35.800 --> 01:50:41.400]  deep down know how bad it is they want to be led against evil they don't want to sit around at
[01:50:41.400 --> 01:50:47.640]  a government-run church with some fake preacher up there about how great he is who's just up there
[01:50:47.640 --> 01:50:52.280]  basically eyeing all the widows so they could suck money out of them so he can go on a bigger

[01:54:15.880 --> 01:54:23.400]  no it is a predatory globalist system and that's why we're in so much trouble
[01:54:24.920 --> 01:54:31.160]  and i have been to a lot of churches folks and very few of them have the courage to tell the
[01:54:31.160 --> 01:54:37.640]  truth i found there's actually a lot of 501c3 churches now that are criticizing the criminal
[01:54:37.640 --> 01:54:42.760]  government and are telling the truth so i think you either do one or two things or both you go
[01:54:42.760 --> 01:54:49.560]  and you set up your own 501c3 outside of it and find people that want to support so you can reach
[01:54:49.560 --> 01:54:55.720]  out in the community with the truth or you do what a lot of churches have done and pledge to
[01:54:56.360 --> 01:55:01.720]  break the blockade where they claim that churches don't have a right to the first amendment now i
[01:55:01.720 --> 01:55:06.920]  get they claim well you're no longer a church you're a 501c3 but they still act like you're a church
[01:55:06.920 --> 01:55:13.000]  so you can hold the first amendment up there i think it trumps that whole charity law because it's
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:17.960]  all fraud based it's kind of like people 20 years ago didn't know the federal reserve was private
[01:55:17.960 --> 01:55:22.760]  and would laugh at you if you said it and the adl said it was racist now almost everyone in
[01:55:22.760 --> 01:55:28.040]  national polls knows it's private they wanted audited or abolished we've passed it twice in
[01:55:28.040 --> 01:55:33.560]  the house to audit it and the senate's killed it so we've gone from nowhere to somewhere
[01:55:33.560 --> 01:55:39.400]  and chuck again pastor chuck bulb is our guest right now i think that's really the good news here is
[01:55:39.960 --> 01:55:44.600]  people don't know what they've had until it's gone and there is an awakening happening
[01:55:47.240 --> 01:55:52.360]  but it's more of a division people are either waking up and they're getting more awake or
[01:55:52.360 --> 01:55:58.600]  they're falling deeper into delusion but the people that are in delusion i found aren't even
[01:55:58.600 --> 01:56:03.800]  really conscious and so they're not even really in the game so there's a lot of positive things
[01:56:03.800 --> 01:56:08.840]  happening right now and if our listeners will go out and show this to their pastors challenge them
[01:56:10.840 --> 01:56:15.000]  and then hold their feet to the fire i think a lot of them will will make the decision
[01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:18.760]  to do the right thing but separately what about the movement because i know you're aware of all
[01:56:18.760 --> 01:56:24.040]  the different developments out there that i've seen of of even big churches to say no we're
[01:56:24.040 --> 01:56:29.080]  going to say no to the system we're not going to be bullied especially when democratic affiliated
[01:56:29.080 --> 01:56:36.840]  so-called churches can can do whatever they want politically so i'm saying even within the 501c3
[01:56:36.840 --> 01:56:45.160]  system it's not equally enforced so it's a fraud well yeah it's not equally enforced in fact it's
[01:56:46.040 --> 01:56:51.240]  more intimidation than anything else look i used to pastor 501c3 church to alex as you know
[01:56:51.240 --> 01:56:57.560]  well and i remember i would get about twice a year i would get a letter in the mail from
[01:56:57.560 --> 01:57:04.680]  usually a law firm representing the irs and it would say um okay as a pastor here here's
[01:57:04.680 --> 01:57:09.400]  the things you can do point point point here's the things you can't do point point point
[01:57:09.400 --> 01:57:14.040]  as a church here's what you can do but here's what you can't do i would get that about twice
[01:57:14.040 --> 01:57:18.600]  a year now i would just throw it in the garbage can i would get it then faze me a bit i just
[01:57:18.600 --> 01:57:23.800]  went by the way you had a big you had a big church it was fairly big yeah and you know
[01:57:23.800 --> 01:57:29.400]  we you know we were still preaching and we were putting out the message etc and we were 501c3
[01:57:29.400 --> 01:57:37.880]  but what i'm telling you the problem is when 95 percent or more of the pastors receive those
[01:57:38.440 --> 01:57:42.840]  letters in the mail and they are frequent they're at least a couple three times a year they're
[01:57:42.840 --> 01:57:49.240]  going to get these and they go over these things point by point 95 percent of them are going to
[01:57:49.240 --> 01:57:54.440]  submit 95 percent of them are going to be can you imagine the Pharisees would have told christ
[01:57:54.440 --> 01:57:58.920]  what he could preach well i mean i just preach yesterday from john seven i mean the Pharisees
[01:57:58.920 --> 01:58:03.480]  hated jesus from the beginning they did everything they could to silence him and then to kill him and
[01:58:03.480 --> 01:58:08.200]  and you know he was constantly at war with Pharisees and there was nothing more than
[01:58:08.200 --> 01:58:13.320]  than what we see today the modern day elitism today the Pharisees of all are the modern day
[01:58:13.320 --> 01:58:18.440]  elitists today the globalists the same the same group of people they're the ones that are trying
[01:58:18.440 --> 01:58:25.640]  to silence the truth and that 501c3 fact exempt status was they was a an ingenious invention
[01:58:25.640 --> 01:58:31.320]  by linton johnson's accomplishing hey it's lbj created the welfare and ruined the community
[01:58:31.320 --> 01:58:34.840]  i mean they just ruined everything and they know what they're doing we'll do five more minutes
[01:58:34.840 --> 01:58:38.200]  we'll check ball one then we'll go to welden and others that are holding stay with us
[01:58:41.960 --> 01:58:46.600]  third hour's coming up folks i got a lot of important news i haven't gotten to yet political
[01:58:46.600 --> 01:58:51.720]  correctness and i've got this other story the government's department of homeland security

[02:00:39.160 --> 02:00:42.360]  and political correct news finishing up with chuck baldwin
[02:00:42.360 --> 02:00:46.760]  one pastor chuck baldwin with his initiative people want to do something this is it
[02:00:49.080 --> 02:00:52.520]  go to your mega churches talk to your pastor try to get them to
[02:00:53.320 --> 02:00:57.480]  talk about the big picture and how the state's trying to fully take over churches
[02:00:58.040 --> 02:01:00.600]  and if they're scared to talk about that well they're not a church
[02:01:02.440 --> 02:01:07.240]  we all grew up here about the soviet union and it allowed state-run churches china allow state-run
[02:01:07.240 --> 02:01:13.080]  churches they're just state-run the churches that get shut down are the ones that aren't and
[02:01:13.080 --> 02:01:17.080]  we're only a few steps away from that thank god there's enough americans out there and
[02:01:17.080 --> 02:01:23.720]  enough pastors who've been basically ignoring this but if you want to see where we're going again
[02:01:23.720 --> 02:01:28.040]  if you look at what so-called leftist churches are doing really authoritarian churches
[02:01:28.040 --> 02:01:36.200]  from austin to san francisco from dallas to chicago they are nothing but
[02:01:37.240 --> 02:01:42.520]  democratic party new world order clowered and piven centers and they're calling for totally
[02:01:42.520 --> 02:01:47.320]  open borders right now that they know will collapse the country i mean these are really
[02:01:47.320 --> 02:01:55.560]  sinister organizations chuck any closing points on that alex just i want to thank you very much
[02:01:55.560 --> 02:02:00.520]  i want to encourage people to go to the website chuck paulmanlive.com and from that point they

[02:02:05.560 --> 02:02:11.880]  got a lot of listeners out there right now that they know the truth and they're christian people
[02:02:11.880 --> 02:02:18.040]  they want a non-501c 3 church where they can fellowship they're tired of the cowardice of
[02:02:18.040 --> 02:02:23.240]  their pastors they're tired of the way the people in congregations look at them like they're from
[02:02:23.240 --> 02:02:29.960]  mars because they stand for the truth they want to join together with like-minded fellow patriots
[02:02:29.960 --> 02:02:35.720]  in a christian church and worship the lord as they know they should and they can't find those
[02:02:35.720 --> 02:02:42.920]  pastors and churches we are helping people all over the country to start brand new non-501c
[02:02:42.920 --> 02:02:48.920]  three fellowships we are bringing ministers together with people who want to have a patriot
[02:02:48.920 --> 02:02:53.480]  pulpit there's a lot of ministers out there that are not able to minister freely in the
[02:02:53.480 --> 02:02:58.360]  denomination and the churches where they are and they're looking for churches that are willing to
[02:02:58.360 --> 02:03:04.520]  have a patriot pastor join them and there are people out there that are wanting a patriot pastor
[02:03:04.520 --> 02:03:09.240]  and so what we're doing is when they all they got to do is go to website libertychurchproject.com

[02:08:35.960 --> 02:08:43.400]  correctness with the so-called first lady and more but look sometimes we start taking calls one hour
[02:08:43.400 --> 02:08:50.520]  a guest comes on people patiently hold i want to go to welden and i want to go to a dale and others
[02:08:50.520 --> 02:08:54.600]  that have been patiently holding so let's go quickly your calls welden thank you so much for
[02:08:54.600 --> 02:09:01.080]  holding from ohio you're on the air go ahead okay alex and good to talk to you to talk to you
[02:09:03.080 --> 02:09:09.160]  last weekend we had a hoax here in toleto they said we had two high levels of micro system in the
[02:09:09.160 --> 02:09:16.360]  water and they banned us from drinking and that lasted like two days and on monday it was all okay
[02:09:16.360 --> 02:09:24.520]  but in the end it all boiled down to we need to spend a half a billion dollars on our water system
[02:09:24.520 --> 02:09:30.040]  to upgrade it now yeah i saw that and for those that don't know about 15 years ago they fast
[02:09:30.040 --> 02:09:36.120]  federal regulations which made it too expensive for the old water treatment facilities mainly in
[02:09:36.120 --> 02:09:41.480]  small towns and medium-sized cities or old cities that aren't growing to force them to upgrade to
[02:09:41.480 --> 02:09:47.000]  just incredibly expensive systems that they couldn't pay for but then mainly foreign companies then
[02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:54.200]  come in and offer to put in the new upgrades if they control the water supply and can gouge the
[02:09:54.200 --> 02:10:04.280]  population and so yes i was aware of that that's what they're trying to do is also restrict people's
[02:10:04.280 --> 02:10:09.800]  land use claiming it's contaminating water but yes it is a giant power grab and i did see how
[02:10:09.800 --> 02:10:14.920]  that turned into a an attempt to make you pay for a half billion dollar water system upgrade
[02:10:16.040 --> 02:10:22.120]  we must have racist thinking huh well yeah i mean if you question anything it's racist
[02:10:22.840 --> 02:10:27.800]  and it's politically incorrect and you should just do what you're told god bless you alex keep up
[02:10:27.800 --> 02:10:33.160]  the good work i bless you for putting up with me thank you so much sir uh thank you welden
[02:10:33.160 --> 02:10:41.560]  we got a welden working here in the office uh let's go ahead and talk to uh dale in illinois
[02:10:41.560 --> 02:10:50.040]  on immigration you're on the air dale thanks a lot for having me on alex thank you um i live in
[02:10:50.040 --> 02:10:56.360]  the southern portion of illinois about five hours away from chicago and uh i live near anthrac station
[02:10:56.360 --> 02:11:03.800]  and used to we would you know very rarely see big buses coming in uh like your greyhound buses
[02:11:03.800 --> 02:11:09.240]  and and commercial buses like that but now it's like every day we see buses coming in going to
[02:11:09.240 --> 02:11:15.000]  the anthrac station and even the anthrac station itself wants to put more cars on its rails to go
[02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:19.560]  to chicago to uh transport these illegal immigrants and it's very obvious because if you go to these
[02:11:19.560 --> 02:11:27.720]  anthrac stations um it's full people you know it's thanks to uh very few of them speak english and it's
[02:11:27.720 --> 02:11:35.960]  it's just insane oh yeah last year i took the family up an esquire magazine met me there did a
[02:11:35.960 --> 02:11:41.480]  profile so it's actually chronicled i just strangely enough because i'd forgotten esquire was coming
[02:11:41.480 --> 02:11:45.240]  to austin so i told the esquire rider we'll just come to the family vacation in hot springs
[02:11:45.240 --> 02:11:51.160]  i want to just go hiking with the kids and stuff and on the way up we stopped at gas stations on
[02:11:51.160 --> 02:11:57.960]  i35 and on the way back and all i would see at gas stations would be like six seven eight nine
[02:11:57.960 --> 02:12:04.600]  buses and it was illegals on them and because you could tell me but i talked to some of the folks
[02:12:04.600 --> 02:12:10.360]  nothing against them individually but it's not 60 or 70 000 kids have come in the last few months
[02:12:10.360 --> 02:12:15.880]  remember they're only 17 percent of the numbers the bore patrol says it's millions they have opened
[02:12:15.880 --> 02:12:23.160]  up central and south america and again i went down to the hike and bike trail about three weeks ago
[02:12:23.160 --> 02:12:29.160]  and was down on barton creek and there were illegals because i went and talked to them
[02:12:30.280 --> 02:12:38.360]  from guatemala and they were so pitiful and poor and fishing trying to eat that i shot a little
[02:12:38.360 --> 02:12:42.760]  bit of video on my phone but never even put it out because it's just like it was like this old
[02:12:42.760 --> 02:12:48.120]  lady and a man and a woman like five kids and but i'm like what is the government doing i mean this
[02:12:48.120 --> 02:12:57.080]  is crazy i mean south and central america are collapsing mexico is collapsing and the government
[02:12:57.080 --> 02:13:04.920]  is going to collapse us with it i just i can't believe it i mean it's got to be like three
[02:13:04.920 --> 02:13:10.360]  million a month or something i mean it it's just like everywhere i drive by home depot
[02:13:11.640 --> 02:13:15.640]  and there used to be five or six day workers out there at any one time wanting jobs i mean it's
[02:13:15.640 --> 02:13:20.040]  like a hundred people send the camera crew over there i drive by there like at 10 o'clock in the
[02:13:20.040 --> 02:13:27.720]  morning and it is just wall to wall just on the side of the road off their property
[02:13:27.720 --> 02:13:36.680]  and it's just insane and its checkmate is what it is you know the coke brothers are now
[02:13:37.480 --> 02:13:45.960]  going to give money to give of the illegals uh medical care clinic care and english classes
[02:13:46.680 --> 02:13:50.120]  and i'm not a big fan of the coke brothers funding clinton and other things i'm always
[02:13:50.120 --> 02:13:53.880]  accused of being funded by him because i'm not a communist but i wish i'd get some of that money
[02:13:53.880 --> 02:13:57.800]  i'd tell you about what i would be great and i'm considering plug products all day to fund the
[02:13:57.800 --> 02:14:03.800]  operation but um there's a new initiative out in fact it's in the printer somebody give me that
[02:14:03.800 --> 02:14:09.960]  i printed about 30 minutes ago thanks where where they're going to get a little card to the illegals
[02:14:09.960 --> 02:14:15.160]  so they can get some stuff from the free market that's not going to ever stand up to the democrats
[02:14:15.160 --> 02:14:19.480]  with all the free school and the free have the babies and the free welfare they'll just give
[02:14:19.480 --> 02:14:25.800]  them even more goodies and then it's like an arms race or something yeah here it is cots brothers
[02:14:25.800 --> 02:14:32.600]  reach out to hispanics and then the article goes through and greg abbots involved and a bunch
[02:14:32.600 --> 02:14:38.600]  of other people in texas that that this will supposedly fix it it's from the associated press
[02:14:39.560 --> 02:14:44.520]  how is giving the illegals more freebies going to make them then like the republicans and like
[02:14:44.520 --> 02:14:52.840]  the coke brothers that'll just create an arms race of goodies and the entire world will just come here
[02:14:55.640 --> 02:14:58.760]  i mean it's it's like there's no way to get around this is there
[02:15:01.960 --> 02:15:05.960]  and they will vote to take the guns and and and to do whatever the democrats say
[02:15:05.960 --> 02:15:11.320]  it's not that these central and south americans and mexicans even have the same values as the
[02:15:11.320 --> 02:15:20.360]  the technocrat overlord science fiction nightmare globalists that run the democrats and republicans
[02:15:20.360 --> 02:15:26.120]  i mean it's a breakaway civilization of technocrats using supercomputers to war game everything
[02:15:26.120 --> 02:15:32.200]  they're using tribalism with big welfare classes that'll riot at the drop of a hat
[02:15:33.160 --> 02:15:37.160]  then they bring a create a big police force to control them which is really aimed at the
[02:15:37.160 --> 02:15:41.800]  producers the middle class that's left the robots are going to cut us out of everything i mean it's
[02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:49.320]  it's checkmate folks if we don't get involved now i just can't believe that we've allowed a
[02:15:49.320 --> 02:15:54.360]  technocratic system to get control of our wealth and build this thing and now they're just flooding
[02:15:54.360 --> 02:16:08.360]  everything with refugees the third world and then you see what they do in in in in stable
[02:16:08.360 --> 02:16:13.640]  countries like libya or iraq they blow them up and bring in radicals to chop all the christians heads
[02:16:13.640 --> 02:16:17.720]  off i guess it really is the devil
[02:16:17.720 --> 02:16:26.360]  because i mean only the mind of ld oblox come up with this dale in illinois anything else
[02:16:28.040 --> 02:16:33.800]  i mean anyone that's ever been to chicago will know that it's it's a cesspool of violence and
[02:16:33.800 --> 02:16:41.640]  drugs and gangs and this isn't helping out at all and even our state is dead it's in a lot of
[02:16:41.640 --> 02:16:47.960]  trouble oh you're in total debt you've been maneuvered into that position appreciate the call we're
[02:16:47.960 --> 02:16:54.520]  not being negative here this is where it's going the plan is to wreck everything and implode everything
[02:16:54.520 --> 02:17:01.000]  but central city areas that'll be super fancy and nice for the elite to live and then rural
[02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:05.160]  areas like whitefish where the elite will control everything you'll go through checkpoints to get
[02:17:05.160 --> 02:17:12.520]  into it everyone else will live in hell that's the public cloward and piven agenda 21 plan
[02:17:13.240 --> 02:17:16.920]  in congress jay and iowa thanks for holding you're on the air
[02:17:18.680 --> 02:17:25.640]  yeah i just wanted to say something uh related to the veterinarian that called earlier uh i got
[02:17:25.640 --> 02:17:35.960]  uh well i stepped on a nail on a job site in in 2004 i lived in michigan at the time uh the funny
[02:17:35.960 --> 02:17:42.600]  thing was was i was just doing what i was told and i went and got a tennis shot and so anyway
[02:17:42.600 --> 02:17:50.120]  a month later i ended up with chicken pox something fierce i was 28 at the time it almost killed me
[02:17:50.920 --> 02:17:55.320]  and i gave the chicken pox to a good friend of mine that was like four years older than me
[02:17:55.320 --> 02:17:59.720]  yeah that's the thing they make these vaccines in the same tanks they make other stuff it's one
[02:17:59.720 --> 02:18:10.440]  of the biggest problems yeah lovely huh yeah i mean you heard her how it kills the dogs and the
[02:18:10.440 --> 02:18:18.120]  hollywood folks won't give it to them they get expensive tighter test or or uh immunity uh antibody
[02:18:18.120 --> 02:18:23.320]  test and and then the and then the vet can be made to back off but you got to pay them off one way
[02:18:23.320 --> 02:18:30.680]  or the other right but again forget the dogs and cats as much as i love dogs and like cats
[02:18:32.520 --> 02:18:39.000]  the issue here is that this is being done to our kids i mean i'd say about a third of the
[02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:45.720]  kids i see walking around austin uh have got an autoimmune disorder or brain disorder or a muscular
[02:18:45.720 --> 02:18:49.960]  disorder and soon it'll be half and then it'll be almost all and we're just gonna have everybody
[02:18:49.960 --> 02:18:54.520]  dying around us and it's the answers just take more shots just believe the government you see
[02:18:55.400 --> 02:19:03.000]  so uh i mean did they directly link the tetanus shot to uh giving you the chicken pox no and i
[02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:07.800]  haven't really done any of my own research on it but it was just odd that i'd never had the
[02:19:07.800 --> 02:19:15.880]  chicken pox before obviously i was pretty immune to it and then all of a sudden i mean i'd never
[02:19:15.880 --> 02:19:20.600]  felt like that before in my life yeah well well tetanus does lower a tetanus here's the deal now
[02:19:20.600 --> 02:19:24.120]  i want to get into the science of it i've had medical doctors on the u n's been caught in
[02:19:24.120 --> 02:19:33.320]  latin america africa and asia adding a certain female hormone forget the name of it to the
[02:19:33.320 --> 02:19:38.280]  tetanus shot so it causes an autoimmune response to the tetanus shot and basically sterilizes the

[02:24:26.520 --> 02:24:31.240]  hit some of that news the next segment talk to a guest and get to the callers that are holding
[02:24:31.800 --> 02:24:37.000]  there are two articles that caught my eye today one of them is the in the daily mail the other
[02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:45.000]  is in cbs news out of charlotte report robots will take over more jobs than they create
[02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:52.520]  and this is a new pew research uh one thousand eight hundred industry experts by the pew research
[02:24:52.520 --> 02:25:01.560]  internet project and the alon university imaging the internet center and a large percentage 48
[02:25:01.560 --> 02:25:06.200]  percent had direct fears that the role of artificial workers will be unstoppable and
[02:25:06.200 --> 02:25:12.120]  that humans will not be able to adjust in time to avoid massive unemployment and social disruption
[02:25:12.120 --> 02:25:20.520]  here is another one ibm develops a computer chip with one million neurons that functions like
[02:25:20.520 --> 02:25:26.280]  a human brain ibm has developed a computer chip which it says will function like a human brain
[02:25:26.280 --> 02:25:31.320]  and a giant step forward for artificial intelligence true north is being hailed as the world's first
[02:25:31.880 --> 02:25:37.480]  neuro synaptic computer chip because it can figure things out on its own zip also has one
[02:25:37.480 --> 02:25:43.800]  million neurons and could cram the same power as the supercomputer into the circuit the size of a
[02:25:43.800 --> 02:25:52.360]  postage stamp now let's talk about that it was a very complex issue obviously but here's an example
[02:25:52.360 --> 02:25:59.000]  of technology innovating things and being good over started four or five years ago and do a
[02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:04.600]  whole report on it this week we're going to get on that and get it done where you can use an app
[02:26:04.600 --> 02:26:10.040]  and you can you only order it when you want it and the uber cab shows up on average in about
[02:26:10.040 --> 02:26:16.200]  five minutes in major cities and i found it's a better experience than the average cab now some
[02:26:16.200 --> 02:26:22.840]  cities are smart and the cabs opt into it other cities are trying to ban it these these these
[02:26:22.840 --> 02:26:28.040]  associations of cabbies because they want to run the other same old system instead of adapting to it
[02:26:28.040 --> 02:26:32.520]  and governments don't like it because they can't tax it and can't control it and they're trying to
[02:26:32.520 --> 02:26:39.960]  block it so of course it's an innovation or a nice black car comes and gets you there's not
[02:26:40.680 --> 02:26:46.280]  it's all set and computerized the meter and you can give them a tip on the computer if you want
[02:26:46.280 --> 02:26:53.000]  on your smartphone that's an example of an innovation a renaissance by freeing things up
[02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:59.320]  and smashing monopolies and of course the power structure is trying to block it on the other side
[02:26:59.320 --> 02:27:05.480]  you've got google coming in with their driverless cars and others where they're already arguing oh
[02:27:05.480 --> 02:27:09.320]  it's safer than humans even though they're having wrecks all the time and driving the wrong side
[02:27:09.320 --> 02:27:15.000]  down the road and these things will be used by the insurance companies will always said will be
[02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:19.880]  now they're doing it to say we need new systems on your car that take control when you're driving
[02:27:19.880 --> 02:27:27.400]  bad or track what you've done or instantly report back wirelessly to the police no we shouldn't
[02:27:27.400 --> 02:27:33.960]  as consumers allow products that surveil us with a predatory system we with our buying habits
[02:27:33.960 --> 02:27:39.320]  should say no to those products before it becomes mandatory which they're already trying to push
[02:27:40.600 --> 02:27:45.880]  smart meters i told you 15 years ago would control the temperature in your house would
[02:27:45.880 --> 02:27:50.680]  gain the algorithms and increase your prices now they've been caught from austin texas to san
[02:27:50.680 --> 02:27:57.960]  francisco california doing it it's not that a smart meter it would be bad it's that a bad system gave
[02:27:57.960 --> 02:28:06.280]  you the trojan horse people who have bad will built it it's very simple it's like if you had a
[02:28:06.280 --> 02:28:12.520]  renter renting a room from you you don't want to rent it to a person that's got 14 convictions
[02:28:15.080 --> 02:28:19.400]  you don't want to open the door to count dracula big fangs when he asked to come in
[02:28:19.400 --> 02:28:26.280]  and this is a bad new world order so basically anything they give us may have some good applications
[02:28:26.280 --> 02:28:30.920]  but it's trojan horse run and has back doors and there's a reason they gave it to us that
[02:28:30.920 --> 02:28:37.640]  didn't good in the big equation can we hack it can we jailbreak it can we end up using these
[02:28:37.640 --> 02:28:43.800]  little devil phones for good things can i shoot a youtube video under a live feed and expose the
[02:28:43.800 --> 02:28:51.400]  police state with it yeah but in the next version they now hit a button where smartphone apps don't
[02:28:51.400 --> 02:29:01.400]  work i happened to be downtown last week when they had a palestinian gaza demonstration about a
[02:29:01.400 --> 02:29:06.440]  thousand people and i walked out of a restaurant to go film it and to do a live feed and guess what
[02:29:06.440 --> 02:29:12.040]  my phone would not work i had a friend with me their apple iphone as well would not live stream
[02:29:12.040 --> 02:29:20.200]  and would not upload and i saw austin cops on rooftops i don't need to check i know they were
[02:29:20.200 --> 02:29:26.600]  with the feds testing a jamming system and they i went home and googled it sure enough they're
[02:29:26.600 --> 02:29:31.240]  using jamming systems all over the country and they have the patents and it's already gone into the
[02:29:31.240 --> 02:29:37.320]  new apples and droids to hit one button at the threat fusion center and disable phones in certain
[02:29:37.320 --> 02:29:44.680]  grids so you're now going to have to buy a vintage camera just like all the new cameras have gps

[02:34:20.200 --> 02:34:26.920]  few years ago to the keynote speech i gave the talkers magazine in new york and he is a former
[02:34:26.920 --> 02:34:33.720]  prosecutor he's a lawyer news decoder and first amendment sentry in a new york-based television
[02:34:33.720 --> 02:34:40.600]  legal analyst linel media dot com and his twitter is linel media as well the reason i want to get
[02:34:40.600 --> 02:34:50.600]  him on is not oh my gosh keith oberman talked about us because who cares and i've bullhorned
[02:34:50.600 --> 02:34:57.080]  keith oberman at the dnc in 2008 and shut down the show before it hardball and his for two hours
[02:34:57.080 --> 02:35:04.360]  and they went into conniption fits of anger i mean you know the guys on espn which is there again
[02:35:04.360 --> 02:35:10.760]  to make the only hero sports figures and is its own form of propaganda where they suspend people
[02:35:10.760 --> 02:35:14.920]  who admit that five years ago their girlfriend hit them so they hit them back you know just
[02:35:14.920 --> 02:35:19.320]  incredible political correctness i'm not saying it's good to hit your girlfriend when they hit you
[02:35:19.320 --> 02:35:24.200]  but the point is is that you know the al-qaeda wants to chop off a couple hundred thousand
[02:35:24.200 --> 02:35:29.080]  christians heads and our government gives them the weapons that's okay and if a race car driver
[02:35:29.080 --> 02:35:34.120]  wants to run somebody over in front of everybody that's okay but my god you tell the truth about
[02:35:34.120 --> 02:35:39.960]  to use slap your girlfriend back you're gonna lose your job i don't mean to go off on a jag here
[02:35:39.960 --> 02:35:49.880]  is just that's political correctness aka mind control aka apocalypse now where colonel kurt
[02:35:49.880 --> 02:35:55.320]  says we train our pilots to drop fire on villages killing men women and children but
[02:35:56.040 --> 02:36:01.000]  we get we court marshal them when they write cuss words on the sides of their airplanes
[02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:10.200]  it's a sick joke ladies and gentlemen it it's the symbols over the substance
[02:36:12.120 --> 02:36:19.960]  but keith oberman and a bunch of other democrats now have been on a jag against info wars dot com
[02:36:19.960 --> 02:36:32.120]  drugsreport.com and and keith oberman also attacked up into sneeze there keith oberman also
[02:36:34.680 --> 02:36:39.960]  attacked linel and you know the funny part about all of these attacks now is they don't even say
[02:36:39.960 --> 02:36:44.360]  what we said that was a lie or wrong they just say well here it is
[02:36:44.360 --> 02:36:53.880]  is laugh out loud perfect trilogy of paranoia sophistry and tinfoil ass hattery
[02:36:55.800 --> 02:37:03.240]  talk about sophistry i mean just saying tinfoil hat that's in a cia memo from 1963 that you say
[02:37:03.800 --> 02:37:11.560]  conspiracy theory tinfoil hat i mean that's declassified that in 1963 the cia right after
[02:37:11.560 --> 02:37:17.400]  they killed kennedy put out these talking points it was only declassified a few years ago paul watson
[02:37:17.400 --> 02:37:21.720]  read article about it and and then that's their response hey obama's putting our military under
[02:37:21.720 --> 02:37:28.280]  nato command did you see the senate hearings ass hattery hey did you hear a lot of the study
[02:37:28.280 --> 02:37:34.360]  shows that the florides causing brain damage a new harvard study tinfoil hattery hey did you
[02:37:34.360 --> 02:37:38.920]  hear obama care doubles the prices triples the prices and really does have death panels in it
[02:37:38.920 --> 02:37:45.400]  the guy that authored it rama manuals brother set it on fox news tinfoil hat full moon
[02:37:48.040 --> 02:37:52.200]  so i mean what happened to keith oberman this is a guy that talked about the downing street
[02:37:52.200 --> 02:37:57.320]  memo when it was leaked where bush wanted to stage terror attacks to blame it on
[02:37:59.240 --> 02:38:04.840]  sedam so they could invade i mean the thing is keith oberman's actually smart folks
[02:38:04.840 --> 02:38:10.600]  but since the democrats are in he will sit there and defend him to the hilt i mean republicans
[02:38:10.600 --> 02:38:16.760]  get in power folks and they start doing stuff i'll go out against them so joining us is lionel
[02:38:16.760 --> 02:38:20.760]  lionel you did a pretty good breakdown of this on the nightly news last week so i wanted to get
[02:38:20.760 --> 02:38:25.720]  you on talk about here on the radio uh it's just keep both of them and though i mean i'm i'm getting
[02:38:25.720 --> 02:38:30.760]  attacked every every day drudger's getting attacked 50 times a day you're getting attacked now every
[02:38:30.760 --> 02:38:37.000]  week i mean i mean i mean do they think we care that they're attacking us no what happens is it's
[02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:42.360]  a weird alex it's a weird pavlovian patella reflex on their part and what's interesting is that there's
[02:38:42.360 --> 02:38:47.080]  an old expression you only know you're over the target when you catch fire or when you take fire
[02:38:47.080 --> 02:38:53.080]  and by the way as i sometimes jokingly respond it's not tinfoil it's aluminum foil everybody knows
[02:38:53.080 --> 02:38:57.160]  we haven't used tinfoil in years but there's a couple of but a couple of things that's interesting
[02:38:57.160 --> 02:39:05.400]  here alex first and foremost every day you must start off your day i can imagine saying i don't
[02:39:05.400 --> 02:39:12.600]  have enough time in the day to go through and cover the panoply of stories that are so critical
[02:39:12.600 --> 02:39:21.080]  yet around the country i guarantee you newsrooms from mainstream media from the ted baxter ron
[02:39:21.080 --> 02:39:28.600]  burgundy echo chamber cookie cutter ass hattery news rooms are saying well it's a slow news day
[02:39:28.600 --> 02:39:35.800]  today now what's interesting to note about this is that what i find interesting is it's not alex
[02:39:35.800 --> 02:39:43.960]  the government per se who is the main stiflers of free speech and those individuals who want to quell
[02:39:43.960 --> 02:39:52.120]  and quash a truth it's individuals who basically are not alex i call them not the thought police
[02:39:52.120 --> 02:40:00.120]  but the thought vigilantes a bunch of self appointed guardians of what they consider to be
[02:40:00.120 --> 02:40:06.040]  the truth not the government and then you have circles in pockets of people who find it dare i
[02:40:06.040 --> 02:40:15.400]  say cool to immediately dismiss that which a they know nothing about b it frightens them and i think
[02:40:15.400 --> 02:40:22.520]  alex one of the biggest motivators of this dissent calling you a truth or a birth or a death or is
[02:40:22.520 --> 02:40:29.720]  that they don't know of what you speak and when you call them out on it and you say for example in
[02:40:29.720 --> 02:40:36.440]  this example where you do know about such as that you do know um no i don't you're just tin foil you
[02:40:36.440 --> 02:40:44.520]  know recently what i was amazed by is that c-span which is certainly not left right wing very reputable
[02:40:44.520 --> 02:40:51.880]  for the first time really is i think seriously broaching the subject of not even 9 11 truth per
[02:40:51.880 --> 02:41:01.160]  say but the physical evidence as to the official story of 9 11 not who was responsible who was
[02:41:01.160 --> 02:41:09.160]  behind inside job none of that and that that percolating through breaking this this this
[02:41:09.160 --> 02:41:16.120]  logical cap so to speak has done more to freak people out because alex what you're doing is
[02:41:16.120 --> 02:41:22.120]  you're you're you're unsettling them you're saying to them a they don't know what they
[02:41:22.120 --> 02:41:27.960]  think they know and b they're not being told the truth you know i was talking to friends of mine
[02:41:27.960 --> 02:41:35.080]  in the news media never going to mention their names we're talking about absolutely at the top
[02:41:35.080 --> 02:41:43.160]  of the heap so to speak in terms of this pedigree of of news reportage and they're looking at isis
[02:41:43.160 --> 02:41:49.800]  merely in an observational mode and i'm asking them well who do you think is behind it what do
[02:41:49.800 --> 02:41:57.080]  you mean who is behind isis what is the reason let me guess just asking who's behind it is a
[02:41:57.080 --> 02:42:03.560]  conspiracy they've now made critical thinking a mental illness they've now made being involved
[02:42:03.560 --> 02:42:11.000]  in knowing factoids bizarre they've now made knowing more than them a thought crime and i think
[02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:16.520]  you're right it's more of the fact that they're so ignorant they just use this as a crutch because
[02:42:16.520 --> 02:42:21.640]  the world's getting scarier and scarier they're losing more and more influence we're gaining
[02:42:21.640 --> 02:42:26.680]  more and more influence and they don't like it first and these are the remember the thought
[02:42:26.680 --> 02:42:34.440]  vigilantes this is not the thought police you know gore vidal had three postulates three three
[02:42:35.160 --> 02:42:40.680]  theorems if you will hypotheses that i think about every single day number one he coined the idea
[02:42:40.680 --> 02:42:47.160]  i'm not a conspiracy theorist i'm a conspiracy analyst that's right he also said that there will
[02:42:47.160 --> 02:42:54.040]  come a day by the way that day is now where it is an article of faith to be an american to say that
[02:42:54.040 --> 02:43:00.280]  there are no conspiracy theories and the third most important of this this this troika of thought if
[02:43:00.280 --> 02:43:07.400]  you will is that conspiracy theory has become a code word for the unspeakable truth you see it's
[02:43:07.400 --> 02:43:14.120]  very interesting to note that when you hit peter and i will never understand alex if you told me
[02:43:15.080 --> 02:43:21.720]  that i would be arguing with people not as an anti american or anti obama or anti whatever
[02:43:21.720 --> 02:43:27.880]  but i would be arguing to say please let me tell you the truth it'd be like going to a doctor and
[02:43:27.880 --> 02:43:32.920]  he wants to read to you the lab results or show you the x-ray and there's a very serious metastasis
[02:43:32.920 --> 02:43:39.160]  or something wrong and you're fighting him you're fighting him on the accuracy of the of the measuring
[02:43:39.160 --> 02:43:44.040]  devices you're you're you're you're talking about the state of american medicine you're talking about
[02:43:44.040 --> 02:43:49.160]  leeches and you're using versions of tinfoil had leeches and bloodletting and you're making fun of
[02:43:49.160 --> 02:43:53.960]  him i've never seen people who run from the truth there's also something here alex which is very
[02:43:53.960 --> 02:44:01.720]  very scary recently based upon this meme if you will this habituation to control again by the
[02:44:01.720 --> 02:44:09.880]  thought vigilantes we're seeing more and more people on subscription radio internet radio
[02:44:10.520 --> 02:44:17.240]  sports who opine maybe not say domestic maybe somebody says something about domestic violence
[02:44:17.240 --> 02:44:22.200]  and you think gee that that's kind of stupid or that's kind of dumb or i don't agree with that
[02:44:22.200 --> 02:44:27.960]  and instead of people saying well i'm going to use this channel it's called the off button or i'm
[02:44:27.960 --> 02:44:33.400]  going to go someplace else or who cares or so what they say no i want to suspend it i don't
[02:44:33.400 --> 02:44:41.160]  want to fire i want to fire because i disagree with this now if you can start becoming more
[02:44:41.160 --> 02:44:49.320]  and more used to people being censured censured rather and send sword for what they say voluntarily
[02:44:49.320 --> 02:44:54.680]  by the thought vigilantes the meme is created we are habituated and conditioned to the fact
[02:44:54.680 --> 02:45:01.400]  that speech does not have to be allowed if it is offendable or offensive i should say
[02:45:01.400 --> 02:45:06.280]  to at least one person in a group now that's right that's the whole hate crime model
[02:45:06.280 --> 02:45:11.880]  where guys that drag a black guy to death in texas get the death penalty but that's not enough
[02:45:11.880 --> 02:45:18.120]  we need to pass a hate crime law so they can then apply it to speech if anyone is hurt by it
[02:45:18.120 --> 02:45:24.200]  now you can't have it well my gosh i mean you can find anybody to be offended by anything
[02:45:24.200 --> 02:45:30.040]  that's the end of the first amendment and also you know alex you uh understand this
[02:45:30.040 --> 02:45:38.920]  but hate the word hate is protected speech how you can hate crime and you can hate terrorism
[02:45:38.920 --> 02:45:44.440]  and hate sin and you can hate that's okay you can hate uh certain islamists all day long
[02:45:44.440 --> 02:45:49.800]  but that is a protected speech now when you take something which is a law which is already
[02:45:49.800 --> 02:45:57.480]  cognizable at law assault and or battery that already exists and you pair it with something
[02:45:57.480 --> 02:46:03.080]  that isn't already protected speech and you combine the two and you you penalize somebody
[02:46:03.080 --> 02:46:08.200]  and aggravate the sentence because they dare to utter an otherwise constitutionally protected
[02:46:08.200 --> 02:46:15.320]  speech then you have the hate crime and what's also interesting is i love this alex i i i i i
[02:46:15.320 --> 02:46:20.040]  used to hate people who said the professional left the professional right left and right but
[02:46:20.040 --> 02:46:28.440]  i say it now almost out of a sense of of uh you know shortcuts but the people who rail against
[02:46:29.240 --> 02:46:36.440]  israel for what and i'm not going to get into an israeli gaza hamas argument by the way then
[02:46:36.440 --> 02:46:42.840]  they never mentioned hamas it's always israel and that's it but those individuals who dare to
[02:46:42.840 --> 02:46:49.960]  mention this this this overreaction will think nothing if their beloved president wipes out
[02:46:49.960 --> 02:46:55.880]  a marriage party in yemen with a drone missile with a hellfire missile that's somehow different
[02:46:55.880 --> 02:47:00.680]  and what i'm wondering what what what amazes me no no no there you go that's what i'm sick of
[02:47:00.680 --> 02:47:07.480]  is the whole debate is a fraud none of it's even real you got isis killing 300 000 people onto their
[02:47:07.480 --> 02:47:13.960]  last name in syria and our government funding them and then no one wants to talk about them
[02:47:13.960 --> 02:47:19.960]  killing christians non-radical muslims literally chopping babies heads off they just want to go
[02:47:19.960 --> 02:47:24.280]  oh you work for israel because you don't want to blow israel up and i'm just going wait a minute
[02:47:24.280 --> 02:47:28.520]  i'm simply saying at least there's some fight going on with israel and hamas and you know
[02:47:28.520 --> 02:47:34.600]  it's tribal and both sides is never going to end boy it's a tragedy i want peace over there
[02:47:34.600 --> 02:47:39.960]  no i'm not allowed to have a reasonable position i'm supposed to just say murder all the jews
[02:47:39.960 --> 02:47:46.280]  or i'm a bad guy well meanwhile no one cares about christians being murdered right you know
[02:47:46.280 --> 02:47:52.280]  you you mentioned something in your the the uh guest you had on prior to me about uh the church
[02:47:52.280 --> 02:47:57.640]  in the first amendment you know we get the the bill of rights alex whether you like him or not
[02:47:57.640 --> 02:48:02.040]  we get the first and we get the second the second is just as good as the rest of them
[02:48:02.040 --> 02:48:12.200]  and america is under attack yet again remember this he remember this but by the thought the
[02:48:12.200 --> 02:48:20.440]  gillantees you see i am not a spiritual person per se i'm rather irreligious i also don't speak
[02:48:20.440 --> 02:48:29.560]  french so what what i'm seeing right now is the systematic mocking bill marr does it a variety
[02:48:29.560 --> 02:48:36.120]  of others every remember every faith looks silly if you don't understand every language sounds funny
[02:48:36.120 --> 02:48:40.680]  if you they're attacking christianity because they want the state to be god they want to get
[02:48:40.680 --> 02:48:46.200]  rid of the old god so even if you don't believe in the god of the christians the point is you
[02:48:46.200 --> 02:48:51.080]  better look at why they're trying to tear it down because they got a brand new god and let me tell
[02:48:51.080 --> 02:48:57.720]  you i don't want to get on my knees to this one well you know i am i was raised from kindergarten
[02:48:57.720 --> 02:49:03.400]  through high school in catholic school and i have nothing but respect for the nuns and the
[02:49:03.400 --> 02:49:10.360]  priests that i had i was never touched or spanked or hit or anything but yet it's open season
[02:49:10.360 --> 02:49:15.720]  and you have a bunch of people to who are the professional atheists you know somebody once
[02:49:15.720 --> 02:49:24.280]  said if atheism is a religion then not collecting stamps is a hobby and what they do every year
[02:49:24.280 --> 02:49:30.440]  year is around in new york right outside the holland tunnel atheists will again citizens
[02:49:30.440 --> 02:49:37.800]  not the government the thought vigilantes will mock mock christmas mock the notion of jesus
[02:49:37.800 --> 02:49:44.520]  so i have said on television and many times throughout my career why don't you show the
[02:49:44.520 --> 02:49:50.200]  same type of contempt for other religions who happen to believe in it oh yeah we never hear
[02:49:50.200 --> 02:49:54.920]  anything from the professional atheist never when when devil worshipers do something or when
[02:49:54.920 --> 02:49:59.720]  radical muslims do something ramadan they don't ever put any good there they would never do that
[02:49:59.720 --> 02:50:06.200]  or make fun of uh exactly under political correctness it's only okay to attack christians
[02:50:06.200 --> 02:50:10.600]  and then with the professional left to attack israel and israel's got its share of problems
[02:50:10.600 --> 02:50:16.200]  and i've got a lot of problems with israel does but it's just so vitriolic and dumb down is the
[02:50:16.200 --> 02:50:21.400]  issue is like these pseudo-intellectuals don't know anything they just go i can know how to read
[02:50:21.400 --> 02:50:29.240]  the new york times and i hate israel and so therefore i'm real smart there is a there is a
[02:50:29.240 --> 02:50:35.000]  kit that you get it's a playbook that you get to be a part of this it's your quiver this is what
[02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:41.080]  you know this is around munition and you must swear fealty to the following you know alex i am and

[02:57:28.440 --> 02:57:34.520]  have no choice i'm an american terrorist yes in addition to that those individuals are those
[02:57:34.520 --> 02:57:40.040]  rights that were given to me by our forebears the second amendment is one that i believe in
[02:57:40.040 --> 02:57:45.080]  i'm a native floridian i'm a second generation cracker which is by the way a term of art and not
[02:57:45.080 --> 02:57:51.880]  anything racially pejorative and we had carry permit before anybody else and i never shot anybody
[02:57:51.880 --> 02:57:57.000]  i've never been hunting in my life not that there's anything wrong with that and yet i'm called a
[02:57:57.000 --> 02:58:06.280]  right wing lunatic because i i prefer and have the unmitigated audacity in believing that i could
[02:58:06.280 --> 02:58:14.680]  implement any reasonable instrument of self-protection for me and my family i am so deluded by the sense
[02:58:14.680 --> 02:58:23.080]  of autonomy provided for in the constitution that somehow my gun is an extension of my hypo
[02:58:23.640 --> 02:58:27.320]  mensulent maleness and i'll leave it at that because there's a family but the meanwhile
[02:58:27.320 --> 02:58:32.360]  government can have bunkers and armored vehicles prepare for war against us a bunch of cowards
[02:58:32.360 --> 02:58:37.000]  have the crutch of calling you an extremist because you're a man who has an instinct to protect

[03:00:19.620 --> 03:00:20.620]  A bird.
[03:00:20.620 --> 03:00:21.620]  A bird.
[03:00:21.620 --> 03:00:22.620]  A bird.
[03:00:22.620 --> 03:00:23.620]  Baby, baby.
[03:00:23.620 --> 03:00:25.120]  Baby, baby, baby.
[03:00:25.120 --> 03:00:26.120]  Baby, baby, baby.
[03:00:26.120 --> 03:00:27.120]  The bird.
[03:00:27.120 --> 03:00:28.120]  The bird.
[03:00:28.120 --> 03:00:29.120]  The bird.
[03:00:29.120 --> 03:00:30.120]  The bird.
[03:00:30.120 --> 03:00:31.120]  The bird.
[03:00:31.120 --> 03:00:32.120]  The bird.

[03:00:35.120 --> 03:00:36.120]  When a bird.
[03:00:36.120 --> 03:00:37.120]  A bird.
[03:00:37.120 --> 03:00:38.120]  The bird.
[03:00:38.120 --> 03:00:41.120]  And I guess I'm at a conspiracy theory.
[03:00:41.120 --> 03:00:45.380]  And I guess that I'm in a pair at a conspiracy theory if I go
[03:00:45.380 --> 03:00:49.120]  Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma
[03:00:50.120 --> 03:00:51.120]  Break it up!
[03:01:03.120 --> 03:01:06.120]  Or they won't call them a conspiracy theorist for saying the word's the word.
[03:01:06.120 --> 03:01:10.120]  Because that doesn't really affect the establishment.
[03:01:11.120 --> 03:01:18.120]  But if I show all the admitted documents and foreign news articles and admissions of our government in Saudi Arabia and others,
[03:01:18.120 --> 03:01:25.120]  funding ISIS or Benjamin Netanyahu endorsing ISIS in the Jerusalem Post,
[03:01:25.120 --> 03:01:32.120]  they'll just have Keith Overman or maybe Harala Rivera call me a conspiracy theorist.
[03:01:32.120 --> 03:01:37.120]  Oh, please don't do that. By the way, I'm not responding to them because it's hurting me.
[03:01:37.120 --> 03:01:43.120]  I'm showing how discredited you are, telling us that you control reality.
[03:01:46.120 --> 03:01:49.120]  Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma.
[03:01:50.120 --> 03:01:53.120]  Put that guy on some Prozac. It sounds like he's having too much fun.
[03:01:56.120 --> 03:01:58.120]  All right, let's go ahead and go to Michael, the balance of this segment.
[03:01:58.120 --> 03:02:00.120]  I'm going to everybody after the break.
[03:02:00.120 --> 03:02:05.120]  Michael, thanks for holding. You're a trooper. You're on the air worldwide. Welcome to the airwaves.
[03:02:05.120 --> 03:02:12.120]  Hey, thanks, Alex. You were always talking about who's going to benefit from the profit of the Ebola vaccine.
[03:02:12.120 --> 03:02:13.120]  Yes, sir.
[03:02:13.120 --> 03:02:20.120]  And a friend of mine told me about TKMR stock, which is pretty well talked about on the Internet today.
[03:02:20.120 --> 03:02:27.120]  So you're about to give me an analysis that's outside of mainstream media. You're about to form an opinion off of verifiable facts.
[03:02:27.120 --> 03:02:33.120]  That's called hate. That's called racism. That's called sexism. That's called homophobia.
[03:02:33.120 --> 03:02:36.120]  Yeah, I did research. It's horrible.
[03:02:36.120 --> 03:02:48.120]  Well, TKMR stocks is for the company TechMira, and that stock is up to $24.31 a day from $7 back in January.
[03:02:48.120 --> 03:02:53.120]  Well, they are supposedly the ones that are going to have the Ebola vaccine.
[03:02:53.120 --> 03:03:03.120]  I started doing research on who owned this company, and it's Mark J. Murray, who's a CEO who used to work for another company called Protiva.
[03:03:03.120 --> 03:03:11.120]  And they've done studies about cancer that has supposedly cured cancer cells in animals without hurting the good cells.
[03:03:11.120 --> 03:03:19.120]  Well, then I started to keep looking and looking through a little small print going back years and years ago on the stuff I was finding.
[03:03:19.120 --> 03:03:26.120]  And some of their investors and contractors were one of the investors at the Department of Defense.
[03:03:26.120 --> 03:03:31.120]  And one of the other people that's involved with them is JP Morgan.
[03:03:31.120 --> 03:03:39.120]  Oh, JP Morgan. Well, again, I don't know about the company to pass judgment on them, but obviously it's good that you're digging in.
[03:03:39.120 --> 03:03:43.120]  It's good that you're looking into things and committing a thought crime.
[03:03:43.120 --> 03:03:48.120]  But JP Morgan is generally involved in anything evil.
[03:03:48.120 --> 03:03:53.120]  They fund gun control. They fund up and borders. They fund the UN garbage.
[03:03:53.120 --> 03:03:57.120]  Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan are the top of the pyramid. They are the problem.
[03:03:57.120 --> 03:04:02.120]  You can debate individuals that, you know, own stock in it or whatever and private or public stock.
[03:04:02.120 --> 03:04:10.120]  But at the end of the day, they're the problem and we know there's going to be profiteering off of anything.
[03:04:10.120 --> 03:04:14.120]  What's your final breakdown on this?
[03:04:14.120 --> 03:04:23.120]  Just really, you know, it's like you've been talking about who's going to profit from all the hype from all this.
[03:04:23.120 --> 03:04:28.120]  And, you know, it's going to fear monger people into wanting to get the vaccines and so forth.
[03:04:28.120 --> 03:04:32.120]  And I know you talked with the veterinarian earlier about animals.
[03:04:32.120 --> 03:04:38.120]  I don't even get my dog vaccinated because I know how bad it is. I don't have a flu shot. I don't even know when.
[03:04:38.120 --> 03:04:44.120]  Yeah, I mean, I've been there in the years I worked for vets. Let me not exaggerate.
[03:04:44.120 --> 03:04:49.120]  At least more than 10 times where they'd give a dog a shot and start having convulsions.
[03:04:49.120 --> 03:04:55.120]  And again, anybody with a brain can figure out, boy, these shots must not be too good.
[03:04:55.120 --> 03:05:00.120]  And then your dog's never sick and gets a shot and then it's sick for the rest of its life.
[03:05:03.120 --> 03:05:07.120]  Whoa! This is big!

[03:06:00.120 --> 03:06:04.120]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[03:06:04.120 --> 03:06:08.120]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[03:06:08.120 --> 03:06:12.120]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[03:06:12.120 --> 03:06:15.120]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[03:06:15.120 --> 03:06:20.120]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family
[03:06:20.120 --> 03:06:22.120]  from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[03:06:22.120 --> 03:06:26.120]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[03:06:26.120 --> 03:06:30.120]  Few filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[03:06:30.120 --> 03:06:36.120]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[03:06:36.120 --> 03:06:40.120]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[03:06:40.120 --> 03:06:43.120]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[03:06:43.120 --> 03:06:45.120]  The establishment is not going to do it.
[03:06:45.120 --> 03:06:48.120]  It's time to take action. It's time to filter our water.

[03:08:19.120 --> 03:08:24.120]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:08:24.120 --> 03:08:27.120]  And I got to be honest with people.
[03:08:27.120 --> 03:08:32.120]  The globalists mean to take over with ambient corruption,
[03:08:32.120 --> 03:08:35.120]  slowly reprogramming the human genetic code,
[03:08:35.120 --> 03:08:39.120]  slowly putting their Trojan horses into anything and everything,
[03:08:39.120 --> 03:08:42.120]  until civilization as we know it has been overtaken.
[03:08:42.120 --> 03:08:44.120]  And that's stated in all their official documents.
[03:08:44.120 --> 03:08:49.120]  I've made films on the subject like Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement,
[03:08:49.120 --> 03:08:51.120]  if you feel like knowing the truth, it's free online.
[03:08:51.120 --> 03:08:55.120]  Or you can buy the DVD and support us and have a hard copy.
[03:08:55.120 --> 03:09:00.120]  We can take control of our development if we decide to take control.
[03:09:00.120 --> 03:09:03.120]  They tell us that's a conspiracy theory, that no one's engineering,
[03:09:03.120 --> 03:09:06.120]  there's no social engineering, there's no control,
[03:09:06.120 --> 03:09:09.120]  everything's just magically happening on its own,
[03:09:09.120 --> 03:09:14.120]  there's no invisible hand directing human development right now.
[03:09:14.120 --> 03:09:18.120]  But then you read all their white papers, they're totally directing everything.
[03:09:18.120 --> 03:09:21.120]  Towards a very bad end for most people.
[03:09:21.120 --> 03:09:24.120]  And sure, you can see a bunch of people with their pants hanging down around their ankles,
[03:09:24.120 --> 03:09:29.120]  looting shops and say, well, you know, humanity's lazy and stupid and criminal,
[03:09:29.120 --> 03:09:34.120]  so wipe us out until you realize the globalists have been pushing agendas
[03:09:34.120 --> 03:09:37.120]  that have literally made those communities like that,
[03:09:37.120 --> 03:09:41.120]  communities just 60, 70 years ago, were not like that.
[03:09:41.120 --> 03:09:45.120]  They have literally turned young black males,
[03:09:45.120 --> 03:09:52.120]  and then now young white males, Hispanic males, into morons.
[03:09:52.120 --> 03:09:56.120]  60, 70 years ago in Mexico, there were not people worshiping death,
[03:09:56.120 --> 03:10:02.120]  tattooing skulls on their faces, and worshiping who would murder the most innocent people.
[03:10:02.120 --> 03:10:06.120]  30 years ago, people were not wearing their pants hanging down around their knees,
[03:10:06.120 --> 03:10:09.120]  which means I'm a punk, have sex with me in the prison,
[03:10:09.120 --> 03:10:16.120]  and running around looting shops at the first, you know, chance they could.
[03:10:16.120 --> 03:10:19.120]  This is the sick MTV Mind Control culture.
[03:10:19.120 --> 03:10:22.120]  So I don't look at these pathetic people and then go,
[03:10:22.120 --> 03:10:24.120]  oh, look, there are a bunch of scum, let's kill them.
[03:10:24.120 --> 03:10:27.120]  I understand the globalists are now doing this to every community,
[03:10:27.120 --> 03:10:33.120]  and if they haven't gotten to your family yet, they will.
[03:10:33.120 --> 03:10:37.120]  Now, under political correctness, though, we're not supposed to decry this culture
[03:10:37.120 --> 03:10:40.120]  so we can keep growing like a cancer.
[03:10:40.120 --> 03:10:44.120]  So see out on one side of their mouth, don't decry it, this is a great culture.
[03:10:44.120 --> 03:10:48.120]  And they show people acting like thugs, dressed like idiots, getting all the women,
[03:10:48.120 --> 03:10:54.120]  and people watch that on TV and believe that that's the culture we should adopt,
[03:10:54.120 --> 03:10:58.120]  and people are adopting it and wondering why they're so incredibly unhappy.
[03:10:58.120 --> 03:11:00.120]  Instead of going to your phone calls, let's just go to them.
[03:11:00.120 --> 03:11:06.120]  I'm speaking of the riots, of course, that have been taking place in Ferguson, Missouri.
[03:11:06.120 --> 03:11:11.120]  And now it's a whole new Trayvon Martin deal with the Justice Department front lawyer
[03:11:11.120 --> 03:11:14.120]  running down there to stir the pot again.
[03:11:14.120 --> 03:11:17.120]  Well, the Justice Department was caught last time behind the whole thing
[03:11:17.120 --> 03:11:21.120]  because black folks aren't getting anything from Obama,
[03:11:21.120 --> 03:11:24.120]  so he'll give them racial hatred.
[03:11:24.120 --> 03:11:27.120]  That's basically the only possession.
[03:11:27.120 --> 03:11:30.120]  Mike, in California, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[03:11:30.120 --> 03:11:32.120]  Hey, Alex, how's it going?
[03:11:32.120 --> 03:11:34.120]  It's going all right, brother. Good talk to you.
[03:11:34.120 --> 03:11:39.120]  Right on. Hey, I'm super excited about that last segment with Chuck Baldwin.
[03:11:39.120 --> 03:11:43.120]  And having been one that attends churches and his description of things being
[03:11:43.120 --> 03:11:51.120]  like a Christian happy hour, the Church Liberty Project seems like a critical thing
[03:11:51.120 --> 03:12:00.120]  because we're losing a lot of foundation here with the way that this new program
[03:12:00.120 --> 03:12:02.120]  has moved into a lot of the churches.
[03:12:02.120 --> 03:12:09.120]  And I hope also, too, that there's a possibility of some visual presentation
[03:12:09.120 --> 03:12:20.120]  for the Liberty Church curriculum to be presented perhaps in a DVD form
[03:12:20.120 --> 03:12:23.120]  because this is a message that really needs to go out.
[03:12:23.120 --> 03:12:25.120]  He's actually doing that right now.
[03:12:25.120 --> 03:12:27.120]  Great points. Appreciate you holding.
[03:12:27.120 --> 03:12:30.120]  Listening on 1340 a.m. KOMY.
[03:12:30.120 --> 03:12:32.120]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ben in Missouri.
[03:12:32.120 --> 03:12:34.120]  Thanks for holding. You're on the air.
[03:12:34.120 --> 03:12:38.120]  Listening on the Free Info Wars iPhone app. Go ahead.
[03:12:38.120 --> 03:12:40.120]  Hey, Alex, it's good to speak to you again.
[03:12:40.120 --> 03:12:43.120]  I just wanted to say thanks real quick.
[03:12:43.120 --> 03:12:48.120]  I'm here in St. Louis and, you know, I've been able to see this whole incident in Ferguson
[03:12:48.120 --> 03:12:51.120]  pan out kind of firsthand.
[03:12:51.120 --> 03:12:55.120]  But the reason why I was calling is because I knew as soon as this happened
[03:12:55.120 --> 03:13:01.120]  that it was going to turn and the media is turning it from police,
[03:13:01.120 --> 03:13:03.120]  you know, militarization of the police,
[03:13:03.120 --> 03:13:07.120]  evisceration of the Bill of Rights, evisceration of due process,
[03:13:07.120 --> 03:13:11.120]  and they're turning it into a race issue and that I just can't stand it
[03:13:11.120 --> 03:13:14.120]  because it's not a race issue. It is not a race issue.
[03:13:14.120 --> 03:13:20.120]  It is a police citizen issue. And the media knows that if they use that,
[03:13:20.120 --> 03:13:22.120]  does that divide?
[03:13:22.120 --> 03:13:24.120]  Sure, sure. I mean, here's the deal.
[03:13:24.120 --> 03:13:27.120]  We don't really know yet what happened with this black teen shot by police
[03:13:27.120 --> 03:13:31.120]  and then a vigil was held to turn it into a big riot.
[03:13:31.120 --> 03:13:35.120]  And, you know, criminals running around with their pants hanging down around their butts,
[03:13:35.120 --> 03:13:39.120]  robbing private citizens homes and burning buildings down.
[03:13:39.120 --> 03:13:46.120]  Again, diverts away from if the police did something wrong.
[03:13:46.120 --> 03:13:50.120]  And if the police did something wrong, it should be an issue.
[03:13:50.120 --> 03:13:55.120]  But you're right. This is really about people acting like morons
[03:13:55.120 --> 03:14:00.120]  when the cops do something wrong and then that being used as a pretext
[03:14:00.120 --> 03:14:03.120]  to bring in even more militarization of police,
[03:14:03.120 --> 03:14:06.120]  which is the exact opposite of what we need.
[03:14:06.120 --> 03:14:08.120]  Does that make sense?
[03:14:08.120 --> 03:14:11.120]  Correct. But I mean, you're there. You say you're,
[03:14:11.120 --> 03:14:15.120]  I mean, you say you basically watch it unfold. Are you in Ferguson?
[03:14:15.120 --> 03:14:19.120]  No, no, I live in the, I actually live in the city of St. Louis in South City.
[03:14:19.120 --> 03:14:22.120]  Because I mean, I mean, what happens is you've got a bunch of people
[03:14:22.120 --> 03:14:24.120]  that have gotten into thug life, thug culture,
[03:14:24.120 --> 03:14:29.120]  who then think they're entitled to hate everybody who isn't a thug
[03:14:29.120 --> 03:14:33.120]  and in many cases to be anti-white and racist,
[03:14:33.120 --> 03:14:38.120]  who then basically run around doing whatever they want and it's okay
[03:14:38.120 --> 03:14:42.120]  because they're downtrodden, including preying on their quote,
[03:14:42.120 --> 03:14:45.120]  own people in these predominantly black neighborhoods.
[03:14:45.120 --> 03:14:48.120]  So I don't want to endorse what they're doing.
[03:14:48.120 --> 03:14:52.120]  I also don't want to endorse, in many cases, how the police,
[03:14:52.120 --> 03:14:54.120]  you know, treat so-called minorities.
[03:14:54.120 --> 03:14:57.120]  But again, in most areas of this country, whites are already a minority.
[03:14:57.120 --> 03:15:01.120]  Within five years, whites will officially be a minority.
[03:15:01.120 --> 03:15:04.120]  But still, I'll be blamed for everything under the sun.
[03:15:04.120 --> 03:15:09.120]  So, briefly, give us your take on what really happened.
[03:15:09.120 --> 03:15:13.120]  Well, I mean, in my personal experience with the police,
[03:15:13.120 --> 03:15:17.120]  you know, it is really a shoot first to ask questions
[03:15:17.120 --> 03:15:19.120]  for later mentality among the police.
[03:15:19.120 --> 03:15:22.120]  And so, although I-
[03:15:22.120 --> 03:15:24.120]  Are you there? We didn't hang up on you. Go ahead.
[03:15:24.120 --> 03:15:26.120]  Yeah, I'm here. Can you hear me?
[03:15:26.120 --> 03:15:29.120]  You got somebody calling you on call waiting. Go ahead and finish up.
[03:15:29.120 --> 03:15:33.120]  All right. Basically, my take on it is, you know,
[03:15:33.120 --> 03:15:35.120]  I've seen the way police act around here,
[03:15:35.120 --> 03:15:40.120]  and I know the mentality of the police in many places around the St. Louis area.
[03:15:40.120 --> 03:15:45.120]  I mean, you have certain different municipalities in St. Louis County
[03:15:45.120 --> 03:15:49.120]  that are notorious for being, you know,
[03:15:49.120 --> 03:15:53.120]  having that almost police gang mentality that they have.
[03:15:53.120 --> 03:15:56.120]  You know, I'm certainly not condoning the fact that, you know,
[03:15:56.120 --> 03:16:00.120]  the lowest common denominator is running around with their pants around their ankles,
[03:16:00.120 --> 03:16:03.120]  burning a quick trip to the ground, doing this, that, and the other thing.
[03:16:03.120 --> 03:16:05.120]  Nobody is saying that that's okay.
[03:16:05.120 --> 03:16:06.120]  But Ferguson is-
[03:16:06.120 --> 03:16:07.120]  Yeah, well, here's the deal.
[03:16:07.120 --> 03:16:10.120]  If somebody comes and tries to burn my house or my business town,
[03:16:10.120 --> 03:16:12.120]  I'm going to shoot them dead in a hammer
[03:16:12.120 --> 03:16:14.120]  because burning something down can kill innocent people,
[03:16:14.120 --> 03:16:15.120]  and it's my property.
[03:16:15.120 --> 03:16:16.120]  It's not because they're black.
[03:16:16.120 --> 03:16:17.120]  I'm going to tell you something, too.
[03:16:17.120 --> 03:16:19.120]  I'm not going to enjoy killing people,
[03:16:19.120 --> 03:16:22.120]  but my instincts to do the right thing are there.
[03:16:22.120 --> 03:16:24.120]  I cannot be run over.
[03:16:24.120 --> 03:16:27.120]  I have a bunch of paramilitary police show up to take me to a FEMA camp
[03:16:27.120 --> 03:16:29.120]  during martial law if something's going to happen.
[03:16:29.120 --> 03:16:32.120]  I mean, I'm done it with criminals of any type.
[03:16:32.120 --> 03:16:34.120]  But go ahead.
[03:16:34.120 --> 03:16:36.120]  Yeah, well, you're exactly right about that.
[03:16:36.120 --> 03:16:42.120]  I mean, that's the unraveling of our society that it's become that.
[03:16:42.120 --> 03:16:47.120]  You know, you have the media endorsing and glamorizing the thug culture,
[03:16:47.120 --> 03:16:51.120]  and so therefore, what do black kids without dad's at home,
[03:16:51.120 --> 03:16:52.120]  what are they going to think?
[03:16:52.120 --> 03:16:55.120]  They're automatically going to think, you know, this is the way to the top.
[03:16:55.120 --> 03:16:58.120]  I have to be either a rapper, I have to be a sports star,
[03:16:58.120 --> 03:17:01.120]  I have to be this, I have to be that, or else I'm nothing.
[03:17:01.120 --> 03:17:03.120]  Yeah, not that I can own a lawn business
[03:17:03.120 --> 03:17:06.120]  and have 20 people under me and make half a million dollars a year,
[03:17:06.120 --> 03:17:08.120]  or not that I can own a pool company
[03:17:08.120 --> 03:17:11.120]  and have 50 people under me and make a million dollars profit a year,
[03:17:11.120 --> 03:17:13.120]  or, you know, not that I can start a restaurant and, you know,
[03:17:13.120 --> 03:17:17.120]  and then build another one and then be middle class.
[03:17:17.120 --> 03:17:20.120]  All these young people, literally, not just black people,
[03:17:20.120 --> 03:17:22.120]  believe they're going to be a movie star or something,
[03:17:22.120 --> 03:17:23.120]  and it's delusional.
[03:17:23.120 --> 03:17:28.120]  And then, meanwhile, remember a few years ago in St. Louis,
[03:17:28.120 --> 03:17:32.120]  they had regular army rolling around, getting ready for martial law.
[03:17:32.120 --> 03:17:34.120]  They've actually worried out different regions.
[03:17:34.120 --> 03:17:36.120]  They know where the hotspots are,
[03:17:36.120 --> 03:17:40.120]  and they're getting ready for collapse in places like East St. Louis
[03:17:40.120 --> 03:17:42.120]  and pre-deploying all these armored vehicles,
[03:17:42.120 --> 03:17:44.120]  and they're now rolling more of them in,
[03:17:44.120 --> 03:17:46.120]  but saying, oh, it's for Homeland Security.
[03:17:46.120 --> 03:17:51.120]  Armored Humvees, the MRAPs, Bradley Fighting Vehicles,
[03:17:51.120 --> 03:17:54.120]  Warrior Fighting Vehicles,
[03:17:54.120 --> 03:17:56.120]  they're going to set the precedent
[03:17:56.120 --> 03:17:58.120]  if Obama could start a race war
[03:17:58.120 --> 03:18:01.120]  and get poor black people to run around and burn stuff
[03:18:01.120 --> 03:18:03.120]  to roll in and crush them,
[03:18:03.120 --> 03:18:05.120]  and then the precedent will be set
[03:18:05.120 --> 03:18:07.120]  with all the illegals pouring in and the rest of it.
[03:18:07.120 --> 03:18:10.120]  I'm telling you, I've been saying this all week and last week,
[03:18:10.120 --> 03:18:12.120]  they are trying to get this country to blow up right now.
[03:18:12.120 --> 03:18:16.120]  I appreciate your call.
[03:18:16.120 --> 03:18:20.120]  It's a very frustrating time to be, you know, witnessing all this.
[03:18:20.120 --> 03:18:22.120]  Very frustrating time to be alive,
[03:18:22.120 --> 03:18:26.120]  because the military are stuck in them,
[03:18:26.120 --> 03:18:29.120]  rocking a hard place, the police are, the citizens are.
[03:18:29.120 --> 03:18:33.120]  We're all being manipulated here.
[03:18:33.120 --> 03:18:35.120]  We're all being manipulated by the globalists
[03:18:35.120 --> 03:18:38.120]  who are controlling the stimuli in an experiment
[03:18:38.120 --> 03:18:40.120]  testing to see what's going to happen,
[03:18:40.120 --> 03:18:46.120]  and then using the de-evolution of society
[03:18:46.120 --> 03:18:48.120]  as a pretext for more control.
[03:18:48.120 --> 03:18:50.120]  It's all been planned.
[03:18:50.120 --> 03:18:52.120]  I'm going to get to that in a moment after calls,
[03:18:52.120 --> 03:18:55.120]  but they're on record arming ISIS folks,
[03:18:55.120 --> 03:18:58.120]  and again, they don't run them, they protect them,
[03:18:58.120 --> 03:19:00.120]  they open the door for them.
[03:19:00.120 --> 03:19:03.120]  Just like if I had 100 piranhas,
[03:19:03.120 --> 03:19:05.120]  and I fed them, you know, and trained them to eat
[03:19:05.120 --> 03:19:08.120]  at a certain time every week in a fresh water pool,
[03:19:08.120 --> 03:19:11.120]  and then I tricked some three-year-old kid to jump in the pool.
[03:19:11.120 --> 03:19:13.120]  I don't run the piranhas.
[03:19:13.120 --> 03:19:15.120]  They don't take orders from me.
[03:19:15.120 --> 03:19:22.120]  They know on Sunday morning at noon, I feed them.
[03:19:22.120 --> 03:19:24.120]  And so it's Sunday morning at noon,
[03:19:24.120 --> 03:19:26.120]  and they're all waiting, getting excited,
[03:19:26.120 --> 03:19:28.120]  biting each other, swimming around on a big swarm,
[03:19:28.120 --> 03:19:29.120]  and I get the three-year-old neighbor,
[03:19:29.120 --> 03:19:31.120]  come on over here, getting a pool,
[03:19:31.120 --> 03:19:33.120]  and that's al-Qaeda folks.
[03:19:33.120 --> 03:19:35.120]  They've bred them, they run them, they feed them,
[03:19:35.120 --> 03:19:38.120]  they don't control them.
[03:19:38.120 --> 03:19:40.120]  But with Pavlovian conditioning,
[03:19:40.120 --> 03:19:44.120]  they know when it's feeding time.
[03:19:44.120 --> 03:19:48.120]  And God help us, because Lindsey Graham says
[03:19:48.120 --> 03:19:50.120]  they're getting ready to blow everything up,
[03:19:50.120 --> 03:19:52.120]  and they're allowed to operate on Twitter
[03:19:52.120 --> 03:19:53.120]  and Facebook and YouTube,
[03:19:53.120 --> 03:19:56.120]  but I get kicked off all the time for no reason.
[03:19:56.120 --> 03:20:04.120]  Navy SEALs expose Benghazi, they get kicked off.
[03:20:04.120 --> 03:20:06.120]  Navy SEALs had a polite Facebook,
[03:20:06.120 --> 03:20:09.120]  remember last year, exposing Benghazi,
[03:20:09.120 --> 03:20:12.120]  and had little memes exposing what happened,
[03:20:12.120 --> 03:20:14.120]  and Facebook kicked them off over and over again.
[03:20:14.120 --> 03:20:16.120]  We tried to send their stuff out when they did that,
[03:20:16.120 --> 03:20:21.120]  and we got suspended for a week.
[03:20:21.120 --> 03:20:23.120]  Navy SEALs don't have free speech in America,
[03:20:23.120 --> 03:20:25.120]  but ISIS does.
[03:20:25.120 --> 03:20:28.120]  I mean, that's what we're talking about here,
[03:20:28.120 --> 03:20:30.120]  ladies and gentlemen.
[03:20:30.120 --> 03:20:34.120]  What country's going to hell in a handbasket?
[03:20:34.120 --> 03:20:38.120]  Dennis, in Minnesota, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:20:38.120 --> 03:20:40.120]  Denise, I'm sorry.
[03:20:40.120 --> 03:20:43.120]  Go ahead.
[03:20:43.120 --> 03:20:46.120]  I'm calling about the police state,
[03:20:46.120 --> 03:20:49.120]  and I'm middle-aged,
[03:20:49.120 --> 03:20:52.120]  and a friend of mine and I decided to go on a road trip
[03:20:52.120 --> 03:20:57.120]  on Saturday, and we drove down into, you know,
[03:20:57.120 --> 03:21:00.120]  a farm country, rural farm country in Minnesota,
[03:21:00.120 --> 03:21:04.120]  went and did our thing, and then we were coming home,
[03:21:04.120 --> 03:21:08.120]  and it was about 9.30 at night, out in the middle of nowhere,
[03:21:08.120 --> 03:21:10.120]  driving on a country road,
[03:21:10.120 --> 03:21:13.120]  and all of a sudden I see this car coming up behind me
[03:21:13.120 --> 03:21:15.120]  super, super fast, like, I almost thought
[03:21:15.120 --> 03:21:17.120]  he was going to run into me, right?
[03:21:17.120 --> 03:21:20.120]  And we get up to a stop sign,
[03:21:20.120 --> 03:21:22.120]  and the lights go on.
[03:21:22.120 --> 03:21:25.120]  It's a sheriff.
[03:21:25.120 --> 03:21:29.120]  And so I go through the stop sign, pull over,
[03:21:29.120 --> 03:21:33.120]  roll down my windows, he comes up and says,
[03:21:33.120 --> 03:21:35.120]  do you know why I pulled you over?
[03:21:35.120 --> 03:21:37.120]  I looked at my friend, and she looked at me,
[03:21:37.120 --> 03:21:38.120]  I said, no.
[03:21:38.120 --> 03:21:40.120]  He said, do you know what the speed limit is?
[03:21:40.120 --> 03:21:41.120]  I said, yes.
[03:21:41.120 --> 03:21:43.120]  Told him what it was.
[03:21:43.120 --> 03:21:46.120]  He said, well, I clocked you at going such and such.
[03:21:46.120 --> 03:21:49.120]  And I didn't say anything, and he was wrong.
[03:21:49.120 --> 03:21:52.120]  He was wrong, I wasn't speeding, I knew it.
[03:21:52.120 --> 03:21:54.120]  She knew it, I knew it.
[03:21:54.120 --> 03:21:58.120]  And then he says to me, where are you going?
[03:21:58.120 --> 03:22:00.120]  I said, home.
[03:22:00.120 --> 03:22:02.120]  Where were you?
[03:22:02.120 --> 03:22:06.120]  I said, you know, the name of the town we were at.
[03:22:06.120 --> 03:22:12.120]  And then he says, do you have your driver's license
[03:22:12.120 --> 03:22:14.120]  and your proof of insurance?
[03:22:14.120 --> 03:22:16.120]  And I said, yeah, and I was fumbling around
[03:22:16.120 --> 03:22:19.120]  looking for my proof of insurance, and I gave it to him.
[03:22:19.120 --> 03:22:23.120]  And what was the nature of your trip?
[03:22:23.120 --> 03:22:25.120]  But then you told him I'm an illegal alien,
[03:22:25.120 --> 03:22:28.120]  and he got your free bus, and some money, and said, bye-bye?
[03:22:28.120 --> 03:22:32.120]  Yeah, my friend almost said, you know, after he left,
[03:22:32.120 --> 03:22:35.120]  she said, you should have just hit the floor in East.
[03:22:35.120 --> 03:22:37.120]  Tell him I'm in Louisiana and gone away.
[03:22:37.120 --> 03:22:39.120]  But I was like, what is it?
[03:22:39.120 --> 03:22:41.120]  No, but listen, I mean, the issue is,
[03:22:41.120 --> 03:22:43.120]  they're tailored to go after the general public now
[03:22:43.120 --> 03:22:47.120]  and get us in the system, and basically, martial law light.
[03:22:47.120 --> 03:22:49.120]  But then, as I'm saying, it's all illegitimate,
[03:22:49.120 --> 03:22:51.120]  they're funding Al-Qaeda, the borders open.
[03:22:51.120 --> 03:22:53.120]  And you drive through all these weird jurisdictions
[03:22:53.120 --> 03:22:56.120]  where it might be a nice police, nice sheriffs,
[03:22:56.120 --> 03:22:58.120]  going to another area, it's a bunch of crooks,
[03:22:58.120 --> 03:23:01.120]  going to another area, it's a mix, it's Russian roulette,
[03:23:01.120 --> 03:23:03.120]  and it's so creepy.
[03:23:03.120 --> 03:23:06.120]  I mean, there are Texas towns where they take the money
[03:23:06.120 --> 03:23:09.120]  out of your wallet and then brag about it on TV.
[03:23:09.120 --> 03:23:11.120]  So how did it all end?
[03:23:11.120 --> 03:23:13.120]  He just kept asking you little secret police questions.
[03:23:13.120 --> 03:23:17.120]  Yeah, yeah, and I just, I knew, I knew,
[03:23:17.120 --> 03:23:20.120]  based upon listening to you and other people and everything,
[03:23:20.120 --> 03:23:23.120]  that I just needed to keep my mouth shut, be polite,
[03:23:23.120 --> 03:23:25.120]  go on my merry way, right?
[03:23:25.120 --> 03:23:32.120]  But I was so, I felt so invaded and so angry.
[03:23:32.120 --> 03:23:35.120]  Number one, I was not speeding, and I knew it,
[03:23:35.120 --> 03:23:37.120]  and so did my friend.
[03:23:37.120 --> 03:23:41.120]  And the fact that he thought he had the right
[03:23:41.120 --> 03:23:43.120]  to ask me whatever he wanted to,
[03:23:43.120 --> 03:23:47.120]  and it was like they were scripted questions.
[03:23:47.120 --> 03:23:54.120]  Well, I mean, the larger issue is,
[03:23:54.120 --> 03:23:56.120]  the country's gone and they're destroyed as well.
[03:23:56.120 --> 03:24:01.120]  So I hope they enjoy it because, you know,
[03:24:01.120 --> 03:24:04.120]  this country deserves judgment and we're going to get it.
[03:24:04.120 --> 03:24:07.120]  And so there's a lot of police know the truth,
[03:24:07.120 --> 03:24:10.120]  but there's a lot of police that, you know,
[03:24:10.120 --> 03:24:13.120]  harassing women with, you know, with no criminal records
[03:24:13.120 --> 03:24:14.120]  is the way to go.
[03:24:14.120 --> 03:24:16.120]  I see news articles all the time speaking of Missouri,
[03:24:16.120 --> 03:24:17.120]  which is really bad.
[03:24:17.120 --> 03:24:19.120]  A lot of the police departments, the state police,
[03:24:19.120 --> 03:24:21.120]  and others, even though I've been sent some good stuff
[03:24:21.120 --> 03:24:23.120]  by the state police up there before,
[03:24:23.120 --> 03:24:25.120]  it's very authoritarian.
[03:24:25.120 --> 03:24:28.120]  And you pull up the mainline checkpoints on major highways,
[03:24:28.120 --> 03:24:30.120]  they come over and almost start your car, get out.
[03:24:30.120 --> 03:24:32.120]  People say, I have a Fourth Amendment,
[03:24:32.120 --> 03:24:35.120]  they'll drag you out and just flip out and say,
[03:24:35.120 --> 03:24:37.120]  don't film me and all this other stuff,
[03:24:37.120 --> 03:24:40.120]  and they're scary.
[03:24:40.120 --> 03:24:43.120]  And it's all federal grants.
[03:24:43.120 --> 03:24:45.120]  And those cops need to know they're being trained
[03:24:45.120 --> 03:24:50.120]  to do this because the country's going to be destroyed.
[03:24:50.120 --> 03:24:57.120]  And they're being prepared to carry out the end of America, folks.
[03:24:57.120 --> 03:25:05.120]  So, and it's not to protect the country.
[03:25:05.120 --> 03:25:06.120]  You know, I got a bunch of other callers.
[03:25:06.120 --> 03:25:08.120]  Some of them have been holding 40 minutes, 19 minutes,
[03:25:08.120 --> 03:25:10.120]  12 minutes, 6 minutes.
[03:25:10.120 --> 03:25:11.120]  I'll try to get to a few more,
[03:25:11.120 --> 03:25:13.120]  but I've got to hit this news because I promise to.
[03:25:13.120 --> 03:25:16.120]  Here's the headline in FourWars.com.
[03:25:16.120 --> 03:25:18.120]  Lindsey Graham tells Obama,
[03:25:18.120 --> 03:25:21.120]  go to war in Iraq where American cities will burn in flames.
[03:25:21.120 --> 03:25:25.120]  He's the same guy that said, you know, launch, attack Syria
[03:25:25.120 --> 03:25:29.120]  or al-Qaeda will nuke the west of the east coast.
[03:25:29.120 --> 03:25:30.120]  Remember that?
[03:25:30.120 --> 03:25:32.120]  When our government's arming al-Qaeda,
[03:25:32.120 --> 03:25:36.120]  we have to attack al-Qaeda's enemy in Syria or they'll get us.
[03:25:36.120 --> 03:25:39.120]  And maybe he meant the deal with the Saudi Arabia is
[03:25:39.120 --> 03:25:42.120]  that they'd turn into Iraq and attack us if we didn't do it.
[03:25:42.120 --> 03:25:43.120]  It's getting weird.
[03:25:43.120 --> 03:25:45.120]  But that video is up on infowars.com.
[03:25:45.120 --> 03:25:49.120]  The U.S. starts providing weapons to Kurdish forces in Iraq report.
[03:25:49.120 --> 03:25:51.120]  Just like they've provided weapons to al-Qaeda,
[03:25:51.120 --> 03:25:53.120]  so everybody can kill each other.
[03:25:53.120 --> 03:25:55.120]  Kurds did nothing to us, deserve all this.
[03:25:55.120 --> 03:25:57.120]  Christian brothers and sisters,
[03:25:57.120 --> 03:26:00.120]  as you know, your government is supporting Islamic terrorists.
[03:26:00.120 --> 03:26:02.120]  Big article up on infowars.com,
[03:26:02.120 --> 03:26:05.120]  showing all the proof on that from Washington's blog.
[03:26:05.120 --> 03:26:08.120]  Obama's out golfing and vacationing as usual.
[03:26:08.120 --> 03:26:13.120]  The Turkish presidential election basically made this guy
[03:26:13.120 --> 03:26:15.120]  even more of a dictator.
[03:26:15.120 --> 03:26:19.120]  You can have elected dictators that then abolish the old system.
[03:26:19.120 --> 03:26:23.120]  I've got a big stack of articles here dealing with political correctness.
[03:26:23.120 --> 03:26:26.120]  This is out of Egan News.
[03:26:26.120 --> 03:26:29.120]  Superintendent on snack rules says it's asinine.
[03:26:29.120 --> 03:26:33.120]  We don't have enough teachers now and have to hire food police.
[03:26:33.120 --> 03:26:35.120]  And now they're saying they can't even have bake sales
[03:26:35.120 --> 03:26:39.120]  that associate and give money to school, even if it's private groups,
[03:26:39.120 --> 03:26:42.120]  because under federal regulations you can't have any type of cake being sold,
[03:26:42.120 --> 03:26:44.120]  and then it's all Michelle Obama running it.
[03:26:44.120 --> 03:26:50.120]  Again, that's a real free country where the dictator tells you what you eat.
[03:26:50.120 --> 03:26:53.120]  District stops federal lunch program over all this.
[03:26:53.120 --> 03:26:56.120]  That's out of Cincinnati, because they said the lunches were so bad
[03:26:56.120 --> 03:26:58.120]  and made kids sick.
[03:26:58.120 --> 03:27:00.120]  It's not that they were even healthy either.
[03:27:00.120 --> 03:27:02.120]  They're like full of aspartame and stuff.
[03:27:02.120 --> 03:27:05.120]  DSPN suspends hosts for domestic abuse story.
[03:27:05.120 --> 03:27:08.120]  I read this this morning and thought, oh, would he beat his wife?
[03:27:08.120 --> 03:27:11.120]  No. No.
[03:27:11.120 --> 03:27:16.120]  Years ago he said a girlfriend hitting so he hit her back.
[03:27:16.120 --> 03:27:21.120]  So for being honest, California debates yes means yes sex law.
[03:27:21.120 --> 03:27:25.120]  AP, the feminists basically say all sex is rape.
[03:27:25.120 --> 03:27:28.120]  Men inherently are evil unless you marry the state.
[03:27:28.120 --> 03:27:29.120]  That's your man.
[03:27:29.120 --> 03:27:32.120]  And so now even a woman says yes to sex on record,
[03:27:32.120 --> 03:27:35.120]  at any time she can decide it's rape and put you in prison.
[03:27:35.120 --> 03:27:39.120]  So that's just a way so women can set men up.
[03:27:39.120 --> 03:27:42.120]  It's pretty incredible how screwed up this country is, isn't it?
[03:27:42.120 --> 03:27:46.120]  White students no longer to be majority in school, AP.
[03:27:46.120 --> 03:27:48.120]  That's right, all over the country, folks.
[03:27:48.120 --> 03:27:51.120]  Whites are no longer the majority in children.
[03:27:51.120 --> 03:27:53.120]  And I mean, whatever, that's fine with me.
[03:27:53.120 --> 03:27:56.120]  It's just that I'm sick of hearing me fall on a banana peel.
[03:27:56.120 --> 03:27:59.120]  It's my fault because I'm white and inherently, you know,
[03:27:59.120 --> 03:28:02.120]  that my ancestors, you know, came up with quantum mechanics,
[03:28:02.120 --> 03:28:06.120]  the stock market and most of the science.
[03:28:06.120 --> 03:28:07.120]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[03:28:07.120 --> 03:28:08.120]  Sorry for the Renaissance.
[03:28:08.120 --> 03:28:09.120]  Sorry for Beethoven.
[03:28:09.120 --> 03:28:10.120]  Sorry for everything.
[03:28:10.120 --> 03:28:12.120]  I mean, a lot of evil came out of Europe as well.
[03:28:12.120 --> 03:28:13.120]  But let me look everywhere else.
[03:28:13.120 --> 03:28:14.120]  Just humans are humans.
[03:28:14.120 --> 03:28:16.120]  But I'm proud of Western civilization.
[03:28:16.120 --> 03:28:19.120]  And the globalists wanted a race.
[03:28:19.120 --> 03:28:23.120]  And so hope everybody enjoys basically living in the third world.
[03:28:23.120 --> 03:28:26.120]  Because, you know, the Western civilizations turned into the technocracy.
[03:28:26.120 --> 03:28:29.120]  It's breaking away and going to alphas and turries.
[03:28:29.120 --> 03:28:30.120]  We're to be wiped out here.
[03:28:30.120 --> 03:28:32.120]  So, just hope everybody enjoys that.
[03:28:32.120 --> 03:28:36.120]  But Tony Stewart hits and kills driver on upstate track.
[03:28:36.120 --> 03:28:37.120]  I've seen the video.
[03:28:37.120 --> 03:28:39.120]  Looks pretty damn deliberate to me.
[03:28:39.120 --> 03:28:42.120]  He's reportedly threatened to do this to somebody else before.
[03:28:42.120 --> 03:28:49.120]  But they say no criminal charges are being looked at right now.
[03:28:49.120 --> 03:28:53.120]  So, again, say you slapped your girlfriend back once when she slapped you.
[03:28:53.120 --> 03:28:55.120]  You're going to, you know, get suspended or lose your job.
[03:28:55.120 --> 03:28:58.120]  But I guess people like Tony Stewart.
[03:28:58.120 --> 03:29:00.120]  So it's not going to happen in there.
[03:29:00.120 --> 03:29:01.120]  Steal a billion dollars.
[03:29:01.120 --> 03:29:03.120]  Get a, you know, get made president.
[03:29:03.120 --> 03:29:06.120]  Still a stick of bubblegum, but put in prison.
[03:29:06.120 --> 03:29:08.120]  That's how it's always worked.
[03:29:08.120 --> 03:29:09.120]  So we're out of time.
[03:29:09.120 --> 03:29:10.120]  Sorry the rest of the callers.
[03:29:10.120 --> 03:29:11.120]  I wanted to overdrive to do that.
[03:29:11.120 --> 03:29:15.120]  Some other news up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[03:29:15.120 --> 03:29:17.120]  ExxonMobil ignores sanctions.
[03:29:17.120 --> 03:29:27.120]  It ignores sanctions begins drilling and Russian Arctic concerns about adverse impact of sanctions rising in Europe.
[03:29:27.120 --> 03:29:31.120]  Well, I mean, Halliburton operated in Iran during all the sanctions and Iraq.
[03:29:31.120 --> 03:29:34.120]  The top globalist 10 corporations or so.
[03:29:34.120 --> 03:29:37.120]  Exxon's number two under Walmart.
[03:29:37.120 --> 03:29:38.120]  Number three.
[03:29:38.120 --> 03:29:39.120]  So now it's under Apple.
[03:29:39.120 --> 03:29:40.120]  That's right.
[03:29:40.120 --> 03:29:42.120]  All the top guys don't follow anything.
[03:29:42.120 --> 03:29:46.120]  I mean, you know, Apple has literal death camps, suicide nets, forced abortions.
[03:29:46.120 --> 03:29:48.120]  Black off command hell bases.
[03:29:48.120 --> 03:29:49.120]  They're liberal.
[03:29:49.120 --> 03:29:50.120]  We love them.
[03:29:50.120 --> 03:29:51.120]  They're trendy.
[03:29:51.120 --> 03:29:52.120]  They're above the law.
[03:29:52.120 --> 03:29:53.120]  You run a hell base.
[03:29:53.120 --> 03:29:54.120]  You're going to prison.
[03:29:54.120 --> 03:29:55.120]  Hell razors.
[03:29:55.120 --> 03:29:56.120]  What they love.
[03:29:56.120 --> 03:29:57.120]  See you today.
