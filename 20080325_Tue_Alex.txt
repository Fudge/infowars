[08:47.360 --> 08:54.320]  would do put out by a liar who you know when he's lying his lips are moving these
[08:54.320 --> 08:59.360]  are the same people that put out fake radio transmissions in English for

[09:04.600 --> 09:09.800]  your ships up ha ha ha as motorboats drove along 500 yards away from the
[09:09.800 --> 09:16.440]  ships there in the Strait of Hormuz which always happens the missile
[09:16.440 --> 09:20.720]  cruisers come right up to their territorial waters and the pilot boats
[09:20.720 --> 09:25.440]  come out just like anybody else's Coast Guard do and cruise along the perimeter
[09:25.440 --> 09:29.800]  our government doesn't care they just put out a fake tape the difference is is
[09:29.800 --> 09:33.800]  it came out that it was fake because there were commanders on the ships you
[09:33.800 --> 09:39.360]  weren't gonna go along with it like Fox Fallon and you know where Fox Fallon is
[09:39.360 --> 09:45.640]  now he's bye bye the admiral has been removed and a little liar portray us can
[09:45.640 --> 09:51.760]  tell us that Iran is behind Al Qaeda and then Iran is Al Qaeda the Shiites are
[09:51.760 --> 09:57.960]  Al Qaeda folks by the way for mainline listeners you know just tuned in for the
[09:57.960 --> 10:02.000]  first time that's a joke I know the news says that but that's because they think
[10:02.000 --> 10:07.400]  you're stupid that's the opposite group they're at each other's throats that's
[10:07.400 --> 10:15.560]  like saying Lex Luthor is Lex Luthor is Superman it's it's it's it's apples and
[10:15.560 --> 10:20.480]  oranges it's 180 degrees opposite it doesn't matter anymore just believe
[10:20.480 --> 10:24.760]  whatever you want just be a slave drink your floor I love your government just
[10:24.760 --> 10:28.160]  believe believe that your dollar strong just there's people who email me and
[10:28.160 --> 10:32.000]  call me and I've got friends you've got family and others who just their family
[10:32.000 --> 10:36.960]  tells them no dollar strong it's all live all the conspiracy theory okay but
[10:36.960 --> 10:41.040]  believe whatever you want then you know people think that they can just believe
[10:41.040 --> 10:44.400]  whatever they want and that makes it reality they believe the live
[10:44.400 --> 10:50.720]  perception being reality that is not the case I mean maybe for a three-year-old
[10:50.720 --> 10:54.520]  who still thinks that picaboo you know they cover their eyes up and they say
[10:54.520 --> 10:58.680]  you can't see me a two-year-old usually by the time they're three they they know
[10:58.680 --> 11:03.680]  that it isn't the case you know a baby covers their eyes and they think that the
[11:03.680 --> 11:07.880]  world went away now it didn't go away it's still right there
[11:07.880 --> 11:13.200]  picaboo I mean that that's what the general public is there's a bunch of
[11:13.200 --> 11:17.760]  two-year-olds saying picaboo all day long and you think you can cover your
[11:17.760 --> 11:21.800]  eyes up stick your head in the sand and all of this stuff goes away doesn't go
[11:21.800 --> 11:26.640]  away it gets worse every minute it grows and grows and grows and the corrupt
[11:26.640 --> 11:31.480]  get more and more power and take over more and more and kick the final links
[11:31.480 --> 11:36.160]  the final good people out of the police forces out of the FBI out of the
[11:36.160 --> 11:45.720]  government out of the corporations so I ran behind green zone attack the most
[11:45.720 --> 11:50.280]  senior US general in Iraq has said he has evidence that Iran was behind
[11:50.280 --> 11:55.240]  Sunday's bombardment of Baghdad's heavily fortified green zone general David
[11:55.240 --> 12:00.160]  Petraeus told BBC he thought he thought Tehran had trained equipped and funded
[12:00.160 --> 12:04.720]  insurgents who fired the barrage of mortars and rockets he said Iran was
[12:04.720 --> 12:10.280]  adding that he described the lethal accelerants to a very combustible mix
[12:10.280 --> 12:15.840]  there has yet been no response from Iran to the accusations in response to the
[12:15.840 --> 12:19.600]  news about 4,000 years military personnel have now been killed in Iraq he said it
[12:19.600 --> 12:23.400]  showed how much the mission had cost but added America was realistic about it
[12:23.400 --> 12:27.840]  again everything's lies out of his mouth I haven't looked it up in two years and
[12:27.840 --> 12:31.760]  we need to look it back up but three years in it was published in even
[12:31.760 --> 12:38.960]  mainstream news that 15,000 people have died troops US troops have died as a
[12:38.960 --> 12:43.920]  result of their wounds but that that's not counted anymore in the mid 1990s
[12:43.920 --> 12:48.600]  they decided to only count it if you died in country if you die a week later in
[12:48.600 --> 12:52.760]  Germany or in England of the US when you're flown out of infection or whatever
[12:52.760 --> 13:00.160]  you didn't die in combat kind of like the Russians in in in Afghanistan would
[13:00.160 --> 13:04.640]  lie about their numbers you know it's now public and declassified that from
[13:04.640 --> 13:13.760]  1960 to 1964 upwards of 6,000 US troops died in Vietnam and it was just kept
[13:13.760 --> 13:20.200]  secret so they've done this before and they're doing it again so if your son
[13:20.200 --> 13:24.000]  gets hit by a mortar but his body armor protects most his organs but shrapnel
[13:24.000 --> 13:29.480]  goes into his brain and then he gets maggoted say in Kansas City where they
[13:29.480 --> 13:33.560]  where the big facility maggots the troops it's called
[13:33.560 --> 13:37.280]  maggoting it's been in the news it happens all over the country they just tie
[13:37.280 --> 13:41.960]  them down in the back and then the mag and the flies crawl up their nose and
[13:41.960 --> 13:50.000]  lay eggs in their sinus and they have a brain a brain meal oh I know it's
[13:50.000 --> 13:53.720]  anti-troop to say they shouldn't be killed by maggots I understand I should
[13:53.720 --> 13:57.560]  just shut up and wrap an American flag made by Chinese slaves around me and
[13:57.560 --> 14:02.800]  shut up about maggoting but that's what the Lord is all about they are maggots
[14:02.800 --> 14:07.600]  their spirit is that of a rotting horse covered in maggots I use that example a
[14:07.600 --> 14:14.320]  lot because that's what we face they they bombard our society from the sky
[14:14.320 --> 14:17.480]  with millions of dead horses that's basically what they do they're just
[14:17.480 --> 14:23.200]  their their their black hole maggot creatures we could see their spirit they
[14:23.200 --> 14:29.440]  look like maggots basically giant maggots in in three-piece suits eating
[14:29.440 --> 14:35.480]  children I ran behind green zone attack of the most senior US general in Iraq
[14:35.480 --> 14:39.640]  has said he has evidence that I ran was behind Sundays bombardment and he gives
[14:39.640 --> 14:43.120]  no in response to the news at 4,000 years military personnel have now been
[14:43.120 --> 14:48.360]  killed see total lies he said it showed how much the mission had cost but added
[14:48.360 --> 14:52.600]  Americans was realistic about it you also said a great deal of progress has
[14:52.600 --> 14:57.200]  been made because of the flipping of communities the decision by Sunni tribes
[14:57.200 --> 15:02.960]  to turn against al-qaeda militants the extent of this is surprising when US
[15:02.960 --> 15:10.880]  military he said promises violated and then it goes on so just all lies from
[15:10.880 --> 15:17.840]  betray us betray us who betrays us Pentagon report finds no evidence of
[15:17.840 --> 15:23.680]  Saddam attempt to assassinate Bush raw story and remember we heard multiple
[15:23.680 --> 15:27.040]  stories Saddam was planning to kill him Saddam tried to hire al-qaeda to kill
[15:27.040 --> 15:35.400]  him just completely made up on the face of it doesn't matter in president Bush's
[15:35.400 --> 15:40.760]  view former Iraq dictator Saddam Hussein was many things a developer of weapons
[15:40.760 --> 15:47.720]  of mass destruction an ally of al-qaeda and a guy that tried to kill my dad recent
[15:47.720 --> 15:51.720]  intelligence reports have already shot down the first two notions no WMD
[15:51.720 --> 15:55.800]  stockpiles were found in Iraq of the US invasion and a just release Pentagon
[15:55.800 --> 15:59.600]  assessment failed to find any smoking gun link between Saddam and the terror
[15:59.600 --> 16:04.320]  group that plotted the 9-11 attacks now skepticism is newly enveloping allegations
[16:04.320 --> 16:08.880]  of an Iraqi plot to assassinate former president George Bush a trip to Kuwait
[16:08.880 --> 16:13.280]  in 93 Newsweek's Michael Isikoff reports that the same Pentagon report that is
[16:13.280 --> 16:19.360]  essentially disproved as an Iraq al-qaeda link also calls into question the 93
[16:19.360 --> 16:23.440]  plot to spur former president Bill Clinton to launch a tomahawk Christmas
[16:23.440 --> 16:27.080]  all against Saddam Hussein's Iraq intelligence service Isikoff writes
[16:27.080 --> 16:32.000]  that was because but he had some sex scandals out then so he tomahawks them
[16:32.000 --> 16:39.200]  Bill Clinton's tough a lot of good old boys should say what you want about him but
[16:39.200 --> 16:46.600]  he hit them al-qaeda's as they devalue your dollar and suck your pension funds
[16:46.600 --> 16:50.600]  you don't care as long as you feel like you're on top of things you like being
[16:50.600 --> 16:54.680]  kind you like being a schmuck you like being stupid you like losing your
[16:54.680 --> 16:58.560]  country you like ruining your children and grandchildren's future fine don't
[16:58.560 --> 17:03.200]  let me stand in the way or happiness and success you've done a great job yuppies
[17:03.200 --> 17:07.480]  great job good old boys great job chicken-necked liberals being idiots
[17:07.480 --> 17:12.960]  being con not knowing which end is up I'm not being nice it's because I'm mad

[25:14.440 --> 25:18.520]  the chart totally insane I'm gonna break down the different facets of it but at
[25:18.520 --> 25:23.440]  least the people are saying no in DC to the quote amnesty and if you think
[25:23.440 --> 25:26.760]  they're gonna give you amnesty oh well might have I come in and look for your
[25:26.760 --> 25:30.360]  guns and and then while they're in there they're gonna look for anything dirty
[25:30.360 --> 25:34.920]  plates they'll see PS your kids by the way we happen to know and then this is
[25:34.920 --> 25:39.960]  as criminal as it gets this is when government is this is Nazi Germany on
[25:39.960 --> 25:46.800]  steroids here it is in DC going nationwide a controversial program they
[25:46.800 --> 25:50.840]  handed out flyers today urging people to let officers come into their homes to
[25:50.840 --> 25:54.240]  search for guns the program is set to begin in a couple of weeks but there are
[25:54.240 --> 25:58.200]  already quite a number of people who don't like it pat Collins joins us from
[25:58.200 --> 26:02.520]  the DC police headquarters with more on this pat when you have got some dueling
[26:02.520 --> 26:07.200]  flyers here this one from the police department asking for your consent to
[26:07.200 --> 26:12.800]  go into your house and look for guns this one from the ACLU it says to police
[26:12.800 --> 26:20.640]  no consent to search our home this could get ugly here your home is your
[26:20.640 --> 26:29.360]  castle the police do not have a right to search your home say no to the police
[26:29.360 --> 26:35.560]  community leaders going door-to-door and ward 8 advising residents not to invite
[26:35.560 --> 26:40.840]  cops into their homes to search for weapons this comes in response to a
[26:40.840 --> 26:45.600]  controversial safe home program the mayor and the chief want people to
[26:45.600 --> 26:52.080]  voluntarily allow cops in their house to look for guns they promise amnesty but
[26:52.080 --> 26:58.080]  some city leaders say this could have dire consequences William Lockridge is
[26:58.080 --> 27:03.800]  on the school board bad idea I think the people should not open your doors under
[27:03.800 --> 27:08.520]  any circumstances don't even crack your door unless someone has a warrant for
[27:08.520 --> 27:13.600]  your arrest Mary and Barry is the councilman for Ward 8 in this community
[27:13.600 --> 27:18.600]  there's already enough animosity about the police anyway and the police can
[27:18.600 --> 27:22.240]  come to your house you think if you have some illegal activity going on you're
[27:22.240 --> 27:26.320]  gonna let them in to see it plus it violates the fourth amendment I think
[27:26.320 --> 27:30.720]  it just doesn't it's wrong headed Ron Hampton is with the black police
[27:30.720 --> 27:35.160]  officers association this is one of those communities where the police even
[27:35.160 --> 27:39.280]  have problems with getting information about crimes that's going on in the
[27:39.280 --> 27:43.960]  community so to suggest now that the police have enough community capital in
[27:43.960 --> 27:47.920]  their hand that the community is going to cooperate with them I'm not so sure
[27:47.920 --> 27:52.640]  that that's a good idea the police say if a gun is found in your home you won't
[27:52.640 --> 27:57.720]  be charged with a violation of the DC gun law a police spokeswoman says if
[27:57.720 --> 28:03.040]  during these consent searches they find evidence of other crimes you get amnesty
[28:03.040 --> 28:07.880]  for that as well chief linear has been clear amnesty means amnesty so it's
[28:07.880 --> 28:11.920]  amnesty from any crime because the reality is that people have invited us to
[28:11.920 --> 28:15.800]  come into their home all right let's stop right there this is absolute bull this
[28:15.800 --> 28:19.400]  is setting the precedent we need to do a story on this let me give you the
[28:19.400 --> 28:24.120]  skinning it started in Dallas about eight years ago then we saw it in Tucson
[28:24.120 --> 28:30.440]  Phoenix LA areas of upstate New York Florida it's called knock and talk
[28:30.440 --> 28:36.200]  Google it and they they predominantly go to middle class upper middle class
[28:36.200 --> 28:40.040]  neighborhoods when they did it in the south and west the thing in Boston and
[28:40.040 --> 28:43.760]  DC's mainly poor areas in blue collar and they come to the door and we've
[28:43.760 --> 28:46.360]  interviewed people this has happened to and it's been in the news we just go
[28:46.360 --> 28:50.760]  people's names of the news and had them on years ago and they go knock knock

[29:10.000 --> 29:15.560]  target women and they force their way in and it is unbelievable random see

[29:22.440 --> 29:26.120]  is really about seeing somebody that acts paranoid and then just forcing their
[29:26.120 --> 29:30.480]  way in and in Boston they do not give you amnesty it's a total lie the government
[29:30.480 --> 29:35.400]  is a pack of criminal scum and we're gonna go over all the different facets to

[33:38.840 --> 33:42.640]  global syndicates that control the private central banks they got control
[33:42.640 --> 33:47.880]  of those in the last 200 years by criminal actions by assassinations they

[34:02.120 --> 34:06.640]  bad you follow orders you do what you've been compartmentalized to do and you
[34:06.640 --> 34:10.400]  don't even see the big picture it takes all of my intellect to be able to see the
[34:10.400 --> 34:18.440]  big picture and then to pull back and go my gosh this is amazing now knock and
[34:18.440 --> 34:24.000]  talk all over the country suburbs of Dallas Dallas proper they come to your
[34:24.000 --> 34:30.160]  door and they force their way in they intimidate their way in and the police
[34:30.160 --> 34:33.480]  by the way usually end up complaining the police unions don't like it you just
[34:33.480 --> 34:37.840]  heard one of the top officers and you know he's with the union so he's allowed
[34:37.840 --> 34:43.560]  to talk most officers can't and he said we don't like this there we're really
[34:43.560 --> 34:49.480]  going to be hated now absolutely but see the establishment wants the people
[34:49.480 --> 34:54.120]  separate from the police they want police tasering and videos of them beating
[34:54.120 --> 35:00.000]  innocent people to then make the public hate police then the police compact
[35:00.000 --> 35:05.320]  even more into their own gang mentality in their own subculture that's exactly
[35:05.320 --> 35:09.800]  what regular street gangs do they're using psychology on you and it's all
[35:09.800 --> 35:14.320]  about how the system and the brotherhood wants to protect you and but really it's
[35:14.320 --> 35:20.320]  there to abuse you and use you and control you so basic psychology is being
[35:20.320 --> 35:26.160]  used on you you know if you're not cop you're little people and that's the
[35:26.160 --> 35:30.400]  system that they're selling them on and it's well known in New York as a
[35:30.400 --> 35:34.960]  detective if you won't get on the take they're going to set you up and so they
[35:34.960 --> 35:37.480]  say hey buddy you didn't know when you joined up you didn't know when you get
[35:37.480 --> 35:41.800]  made detective you didn't know when you got on the narcotics vice squad that we
[35:41.800 --> 35:46.120]  deal the drugs they've had like five different house cleanings there where
[35:46.120 --> 35:50.920]  they admit over 75% are the narcotics traffickers in New York Dallas it's
[35:50.920 --> 35:54.120]  been admitted they just randomly pull you over in a nice car throw a bag of
[35:54.120 --> 35:58.360]  shock in the back take your car take your home no judge no jury no nothing
[35:58.360 --> 36:12.000]  that's called tyranny and it's taking over and it's everywhere and DC is rated
[36:12.000 --> 36:16.240]  as the third or fourth depending on which every year they get a different
[36:16.240 --> 36:19.880]  place but they're usually in the top five LA is usually number one Chicago
[36:19.880 --> 36:25.040]  number two New York number three but DC's closely behind them just for murder
[36:25.040 --> 36:31.280]  for hire prostitution drug dealing and the average beat cops just out trying to
[36:31.280 --> 36:34.720]  stop robberies and help little ladies across the street but the higher ups is
[36:34.720 --> 36:39.000]  just a criminal enterprise this is the place where the mayor's on video you
[36:39.000 --> 36:45.840]  know smoking cocaine and they have a total gun ban in the city and the
[36:45.840 --> 36:48.640]  Supreme Court's about to rule that they can't have gun bans they're going to
[36:48.640 --> 36:52.680]  spend it so we have a right we can still ban your guns I've read the briefs I've
[36:52.680 --> 36:54.920]  read what the Supreme Court said it'll be out the next few months you'll see
[36:54.920 --> 36:59.200]  but I predicted before what even the oral arguments and statements would be and
[36:59.200 --> 37:02.520]  it was exactly what I said it would be because I know government policy I know
[37:02.520 --> 37:07.400]  how these crooks operate I know every one of their tricks tricks within tricks
[37:07.400 --> 37:11.080]  within tricks within tricks within tricks and it's real simple once you
[37:11.080 --> 37:15.760]  figure out the tricks it's just like knowing how a magician does a coin
[37:15.760 --> 37:20.800]  trick you know if you're a five-year-old you think it's real but if you're 30
[37:20.800 --> 37:26.920]  years old you know it's fake don't again pro wrestling's fake it's not real it's
[37:26.920 --> 37:33.920]  all a simulation of liberty a simulation of voting a simulation well this is the
[37:33.920 --> 37:38.160]  rebellion against the simulation against the matrix and we're not going along
[37:38.160 --> 37:45.600]  with it anymore so getting back to DC I mean on the face of it oh this is for
[37:45.600 --> 37:50.480]  your safety we're doing safety checks where we want to try to intimidate our
[37:50.480 --> 37:55.320]  way into all of your houses on the face of it a complete violation of the Fourth
[37:55.320 --> 38:00.400]  Amendment a complete violation of Magna Carta common law every canon of a free
[38:00.400 --> 38:07.640]  society a violation of just the most basic fundamental rights and then it
[38:07.640 --> 38:17.360]  gets worse the police the prosecutors do not have a right to give amnesty only a
[38:17.360 --> 38:22.160]  governor at the end of their term and then that and then that is politically
[38:22.160 --> 38:26.080]  scrutinized and they can get in trouble and go to jail if it's improper only a
[38:26.080 --> 38:31.280]  governor or a president can engage in pardons and an unlimited respect if you
[38:31.280 --> 38:34.920]  go in a house and somebody's putting cigarettes out on their kid or you go in
[38:34.920 --> 38:38.880]  a house and there's a meth lab in the back or you go in a house and there's a
[38:38.880 --> 38:44.040]  dead person in a trunk there is not amnesty now on the surface they can't
[38:44.040 --> 38:48.480]  do that and that's illegal and criminal and violates hundreds of laws but it's
[38:48.480 --> 38:55.600]  worse than that folks they don't give you any amnesty that is absolute bull I know
[38:55.600 --> 38:59.640]  from the phoenix stories the Tucson stories the Dallas Morning News stories
[38:59.640 --> 39:06.520]  out of Dallas they do not and they evil then when they come to your door and say
[39:06.520 --> 39:10.360]  well no you can't sir they say well what do you have to hide ma'am sir and you
[39:10.360 --> 39:13.840]  know what I'm gonna say listen to me you know you're violating the fourth
[39:13.840 --> 39:17.280]  amendment I know your your bosses want to set a precedent to do this shame on
[39:17.280 --> 39:21.240]  you I want your badge numbers right now if this goes any further you're gonna
[39:21.240 --> 39:25.440]  personally be litigated and you can beat the rap you can't beat the ride I will
[39:25.440 --> 39:29.200]  see you personally you're outside of your jurisdiction your office you're not
[39:29.200 --> 39:33.880]  allowed to cross the threshold of my property line my yard unless you've got
[39:33.880 --> 39:37.360]  some probable cause or a call now their big trick is they'll claim you've got a
[39:37.360 --> 39:41.400]  911 call then when you try to go get the records they just don't exist that's a
[39:41.400 --> 39:52.880]  big trick they use and it's it's it's just so criminal the bad guys do things
[39:52.880 --> 39:58.680]  like that the bad guys try to come to your home now remember Bill Clinton on
[39:58.680 --> 40:03.400]  MTV send my book to sit in the tyranny actually have the quote I forgot to find
[40:03.400 --> 40:08.560]  her in the break let me see there's president Bush September 11th 1990 out
[40:08.560 --> 40:11.680]  of these troubled times a new world order can emerge under United Nations that
[40:11.680 --> 40:15.240]  performs as envisioned by its founders the first four pages are quotes in my
[40:15.240 --> 40:19.120]  book there's hg wells saying they're gonna kill the majority of us under the
[40:19.120 --> 40:23.960]  new world order there's authors Lessinger Jr saying the same thing there's
[40:23.960 --> 40:28.200]  Henry Kissinger saying they're gonna use UN troops in America after staging
[40:28.200 --> 40:33.840]  terror attacks there's George Bush senior calling for world government again
[40:33.840 --> 40:38.200]  where's my Bill Clinton quote there's Ted Turner saying he wants to kill 95% of
[40:38.200 --> 40:44.240]  us there's Prince Philip saying it no it's not then where's my David Rockefeller
[40:44.240 --> 40:47.280]  we're on the verge of a global transformation all we need is the
[40:47.280 --> 40:55.840]  right major crisis the nations will accept a new world order no that's not
[40:55.840 --> 41:01.080]  it oh here's Bill Clinton when we got organized as a country and we wrote a
[41:01.080 --> 41:04.800]  fairly radical constitution with a radical bill of rights giving a radical
[41:04.800 --> 41:08.080]  amount of individual freedoms to Americans and so a lot of people say
[41:08.080 --> 41:12.040]  there's too much personal freedom and personal freedom being abused you have
[41:12.040 --> 41:16.680]  to move to limit it that's what we did in the announcement I made last weekend
[41:16.680 --> 41:20.440]  on the public housing projects and how we're going to have weapons sweeps and
[41:20.440 --> 41:24.440]  more things like that to try to make people safer in their communities
[41:24.440 --> 41:29.800]  president Bill Clinton March 22nd 94 MTV's enough is enough their little
[41:29.800 --> 41:33.520]  cult brainwashing thing where they tell the kids to rat on their parents and
[41:33.520 --> 41:39.280]  turn your guns in and they started back then doing gun sweeps and projects
[41:39.280 --> 41:42.360]  saying you don't have any right to own a gun because you're in government
[41:42.360 --> 41:48.880]  housing and see now they've just moved on to suburbs and $400,000 houses in
[41:48.880 --> 41:58.560]  Dallas and Tucson and Los Angeles and the cops come to your door and they
[41:58.560 --> 42:03.320]  just go door to door there's no judge no jury no warrants no probable
[42:03.320 --> 42:09.520]  cause no suspicion no nothing it's just you're all guilty until proven innocent
[42:09.520 --> 42:13.320]  and we're the secret police and we're here to talk to you well there's many
[42:13.320 --> 42:17.040]  other areas where this happens you know everybody's told even if you've got
[42:17.040 --> 42:21.120]  money it's not welfare you know to be it's not your poor it's not your lower
[42:21.120 --> 42:24.440]  blue collar it's oh you know the government's got a head start and they
[42:24.440 --> 42:27.560]  advertise it for everybody and put your kid in school when they're two or three
[42:27.560 --> 42:33.040]  and by the way you're gonna get three CPS visits a year and they come to your
[42:33.040 --> 42:36.320]  house and they find something to grab your kid and go sell it to pedophiles
[42:36.320 --> 42:39.520]  about a tenth of the time the rest of the time it's just a well-meaning
[42:39.520 --> 42:43.840]  families that pay 500 grand 300 grand depending on the child or they take it
[42:43.840 --> 42:46.960]  if it's a black child or Hispanic child and test pesticides on it till the child
[42:46.960 --> 42:52.800]  dies I was on a local number one talk show here in Austin for two and a half
[42:52.800 --> 42:56.040]  hours this morning and I just go on the show and say Google this Google that
[42:56.040 --> 43:01.960]  Google Bush kissing a gay porn star at the press dinner and you know and the
[43:01.960 --> 43:05.040]  same guy that visits the White House at midnight and they didn't believe me they
[43:05.040 --> 43:08.400]  googled it there it was and then I said Google force-feeding black kids
[43:08.400 --> 43:12.440]  pesticides they googled it there it was mainstream news I mean I'm not the one
[43:12.440 --> 43:16.120]  that did all this I'm sorry it sounds crazy Dinecore Halliburton running
[43:16.120 --> 43:21.400]  child kidnapping rings I mean these kids just hardcore crooks run it all they
[43:21.400 --> 43:26.520]  enjoy it you understand psychopaths run the government now and they order the
[43:26.520 --> 43:31.120]  police to go out and get in the business of confiscating your guns they didn't
[43:31.120 --> 43:36.840]  hire 26,000 preachers and train them and pay them covertly to give sermons
[43:36.840 --> 43:40.960]  telling their flocks this is secret now it's public but imagine them saying this
[43:40.960 --> 43:44.640]  is secret don't tell them here's what you're supposed to preach turn your guns
[43:44.640 --> 43:48.600]  in submit to government go to FEMA camps let them break your families up take
[43:48.600 --> 43:52.480]  inoculations I gave you the secret documents a year and a half before it
[43:52.480 --> 43:59.920]  was on the news you think they hired 26,000 preachers 23,000 executives 450,000
[43:59.920 --> 44:03.760]  truck drivers to be tattletales you think they in every major public school give
[44:03.760 --> 44:07.760]  the kids discount $200 credit cards to report on their parents and what's in
[44:07.760 --> 44:11.640]  the medicine cabinet because they're nice people or they want to keep you safe
[44:11.640 --> 44:19.440]  they're taking over they are going to come and they are going to have fire
[44:19.440 --> 44:24.680]  fights and they are going to kill you the SWAT teams are going to set fire to
[44:24.680 --> 44:30.360]  your house they're going to have little robots roll up and fire a firebomb into
[44:30.360 --> 44:34.120]  your house and then they're going to have fire engines next door to it to
[44:34.120 --> 44:38.000]  spray down the other houses and they're going to turn the gas off and they're
[44:38.000 --> 44:42.560]  going to burn you up in your house that's what they're training to do I was
[44:42.560 --> 44:46.160]  shown secret Marine Corps footage that I wasn't allowed to air I have similar
[44:46.160 --> 44:49.720]  footage I shot myself where the people scream where Americans don't take our
[44:49.720 --> 44:54.320]  farmland and with heavy machine guns they simulate mowing hundreds of us down
[44:54.320 --> 45:01.880]  for protesting they're here to kill you and your family do you understand I'm
[45:01.880 --> 45:06.640]  not risking my life for nothing this isn't a drill this isn't a simulation
[45:06.640 --> 45:14.280]  this is real they have armies huge divisions of aggravated violent
[45:14.280 --> 45:20.440]  felons and illegal aliens ready to eat their own guts and ask for seconds what
[45:20.440 --> 45:26.440]  makes the grass grow blood blood blood the Pentagon the British Defense
[45:26.440 --> 45:30.960]  Ministries official reports admit their new mission is suppressing domestic
[45:30.960 --> 45:37.160]  populations they want your guns they want your sons and daughters they want
[45:37.160 --> 45:40.800]  your bank accounts and they're going to have it
[45:40.800 --> 45:46.920]  Ketler Stalin Mao Caligula thousands of dictators they do it because they like
[45:46.920 --> 45:51.560]  it they're bored they like to burn cities they like to fly remote control
[45:51.560 --> 45:56.160]  jets in the buildings they like to nuke cities they like to put cancer viruses
[45:56.160 --> 46:01.760]  in your vaccines they like to hurt you and because you're not like them you
[46:01.760 --> 46:08.920]  can't wrap your mind around that level of evil but to them that's power they
[46:08.920 --> 46:18.520]  revel they give awards to whoever is most vicious they enjoy what they do they
[46:18.520 --> 46:22.080]  don't care if you've got a free market or a good life contrary they don't want
[46:22.080 --> 46:30.600]  anyone happy but themselves they like dark boarded up cities with smoke stacks
[46:30.600 --> 46:35.400]  dirtying the air as they live on their private villas and you slave and they've
[46:35.400 --> 46:39.800]  got two changes of clothes in your tiny apartment with no running water that's
[46:39.800 --> 46:44.760]  what they like you know I wasn't joking around I talked to Rob about it yesterday
[46:44.760 --> 46:48.120]  he worked with me on martial law he remembers all of Arnold Schwarzenegger's
[46:48.120 --> 46:56.040]  artwork of dead babies covered with worms little girls in provocative positions
[46:56.040 --> 47:03.240]  in Nazi uniforms demons leering over babies remember the artwork on PBS of
[47:03.240 --> 47:08.920]  Jack Kevorkian it's demons eating babies as they come out of women's wombs I'll
[47:08.920 --> 47:15.720]  never forget seeing a big New York function with Tom Cruise and people I
[47:15.720 --> 47:19.720]  was just flipping through TV about 10 years ago and it came to Jack I mean
[47:19.720 --> 47:24.120]  15 years ago to Jack Kevorkian going this is my art I painted it in my own
[47:24.120 --> 47:31.160]  blood and it's a demon eating a baby triple X you know pornography but it was
[47:31.160 --> 47:34.760]  okay to show on PBS because it was so beautiful so they showed it on mainline
[47:34.760 --> 47:41.000]  PBS in Austin of a demon eating a baby coming out of a woman and then this art
[47:41.000 --> 47:47.160]  was quote good it was very shocking provocative it made me have adrenaline
[47:47.160 --> 47:51.400]  releases when they would cut to another painting I mean really wicked looking
[47:51.400 --> 47:55.960]  demons right out of nightmares things that were palpable and he would say I
[47:55.960 --> 48:02.800]  painted this in my own blood there were all these superstar supermodels
[48:02.800 --> 48:12.360]  giddily kissing all over me going that's who runs things that's what they
[48:12.360 --> 48:18.800]  like is demons eating babies little girls in little Nazi uniforms
[48:18.800 --> 48:24.960]  provocatively laying on the ground that's who they are ladies and gentlemen
[48:24.960 --> 48:33.600]  pit of hell demons with huge forces of psychopaths and sociopaths and bullies
[48:33.600 --> 48:44.560]  ready to murder you and your family I'm not joking around that's the reality
[48:44.560 --> 48:48.080]  that's what they're gonna do if we let them do door-to-door random gun searches
[48:48.080 --> 48:51.320]  if we let them do what they did in New Orleans if we let them do everything
[48:51.320 --> 48:55.720]  they're doing they didn't triple the size of the BATF to play deadly winks we
[48:55.720 --> 49:00.160]  are gonna incrementally you think I'm joking the White House wrote memos
[49:00.160 --> 49:04.520]  saying they can sexually torture children and I can't believe there are
[49:04.520 --> 49:08.680]  people that support that I can't believe their neocon talk show hosts that say
[49:08.680 --> 49:13.680]  it's good that find the limbaugh clip where he says Abu Ghraib was fun
[49:13.680 --> 49:18.640]  blowing off steam you see they're really letting you know who they are aren't
[49:18.640 --> 49:24.320]  they there's nothing they love more than having you chain down
[49:24.320 --> 49:28.000]  psychopaths are all the same folks they love it when you're chained down they
[49:28.000 --> 49:31.160]  get to come in and terrorize you in the fear in your eyes and more often than
[49:31.160 --> 49:34.560]  not they like to bite and they just reach over and bite a big bloody chunk
[49:34.560 --> 49:38.680]  out in the blood runs down their face and they they take off their their suit

[49:59.600 --> 50:04.440]  I tell the good people it's time we rise up and prepare ourselves and it's time
[50:04.440 --> 50:11.000]  we make the commitment to realize that these enemies cannot stand before us if
[50:11.000 --> 50:16.280]  we simply ask God to lead God and direct us and fill ourselves with righteous
[50:16.280 --> 50:21.960]  rage and strength of the human spirit and all that is decent to let them know
[50:21.960 --> 50:48.920]  that they will be defeated
[50:52.800 --> 50:57.440]  our beloved Republic is on her knees the forces of globalism are destroying

[52:06.680 --> 52:10.400]  organizations could care for those unable to care for themselves we would
[52:10.400 --> 52:14.400]  intend not to be standing in the bread line with the ignorant and the foolish
[52:14.400 --> 52:17.960]  who pretend the facts of food disappearance are untrue if the

[55:26.720 --> 55:31.240]  before and now I've got to let you know about something that's going on in a
[55:31.240 --> 55:37.280]  little place called Rutland Vermont our inspector and Pat Lady came down to town
[55:37.280 --> 55:46.120]  the other day and had a forum about crime in town it's a little town about
[55:46.120 --> 55:52.440]  17 16 17,000 people and you know accountable crimes on one hand let's
[55:52.440 --> 55:56.720]  say they were bad you know I don't I wouldn't want to diminish them but now
[55:56.720 --> 56:02.160]  25 years of corruption locally and all these kinds of things okay so what did
[56:02.160 --> 56:09.000]  they propose federal money they got helicopters flying overhead at night so
[56:09.000 --> 56:12.760]  that they can pick out cars that have one yeah look here's the deal you know
[56:12.760 --> 56:15.920]  they break in businesses around here cops won't come but they're there right
[56:15.920 --> 56:19.080]  in the soccer mom's tickets for going five miles over the speed limit they
[56:19.080 --> 56:24.440]  steal your car the cops won't come and we've got I don't know from 300,000 cops
[56:24.440 --> 56:28.040]  to 2 million cops they just keep hiring more and more and more to run our lives
[56:28.040 --> 56:35.240]  period yeah it seems that they've called in the big guns you know little
[56:35.240 --> 56:41.120]  little situation and also yeah everything is a crisis everything is oh the
[56:41.120 --> 56:45.760]  anti-terror money is not gonna be anti-crime money it's federalization yeah
[56:45.760 --> 56:50.000]  I know this is this is the situation the reason I called in before was that you
[56:50.000 --> 56:54.920]  gave me some great information about the Delphi technique which I had the
[56:54.920 --> 57:00.520]  Delphi technique used on me I basically got called also by the I decided to
[57:00.520 --> 57:06.040]  become an activist go downtown and deal with these things head on so came out
[57:06.040 --> 57:09.960]  that I had a little meeting with the head of the editor of the newspaper who
[57:09.960 --> 57:13.320]  looked at me I'd met the man one time and he pointed to me and he said you've
[57:13.320 --> 57:17.040]  got no credibility in this community and I thought well you know that's
[57:17.040 --> 57:20.240]  interesting that I you know they've said come down bring your ideas yeah that's
[57:20.240 --> 57:24.640]  the way to neutralize you you say you don't count peasant or now you're
[57:24.640 --> 57:28.120]  mentally ill you know there's there's more than 15 designations for thinking
[57:28.120 --> 57:32.680]  the government's corrupt is now mentally ill well I don't feel mental I feel I
[57:32.680 --> 57:37.440]  feel served they just do it to change the subject it's like when you say I don't
[57:37.440 --> 57:42.080]  want centra to take over all our roads the paper just says centra isn't Spanish
[57:42.080 --> 57:46.560]  owned I mean it's a public lie anyone could find out in five seconds it isn't
[57:46.560 --> 57:52.600]  true they just don't care they practice lying as a science to condition you to
[57:52.600 --> 57:59.240]  accept it the forum even I thought it was an open forum with you know with
[57:59.240 --> 58:03.200]  these federal island specter who also wrote a new book I guess he was out to
[58:03.200 --> 58:08.680]  push that but I sort of show up and they only invite in health care workers
[58:08.680 --> 58:14.360]  education workers and the mayor and the police and the mayor who sat there and
[58:14.360 --> 58:18.880]  the mayor's family is sold tobacco and yeah they all go there just to feel
[58:18.880 --> 58:22.400]  powerful they're all slaves they've been injected with the cancer viruses they

[1:02:14.800 --> 1:02:18.920]  even probably break my psyche but you can't beat the energy and the
[1:02:18.920 --> 1:02:24.880]  information that I've put out and that others have put out and from the
[1:02:24.880 --> 1:02:29.800]  foundations of the earth your new world order was destined to fall just as it was
[1:02:29.800 --> 1:02:35.320]  destined to be built it was destined to become crashing down right as it was
[1:02:35.320 --> 1:02:45.640]  completed so you revel in your darkness I'll revel in the light but just know

[1:03:16.600 --> 1:03:22.680]  I had a basic question about civil your civil rights my girlfriend was on the
[1:03:22.680 --> 1:03:28.600]  phone with me and we were having sort of an argument and the neighbor called the
[1:03:28.600 --> 1:03:34.720]  police now they were knocking on the door and she was being loud in her home
[1:03:34.720 --> 1:03:40.440]  and what they did was they knocked for about 45 minutes until she opened the
[1:03:40.440 --> 1:03:47.920]  door then they said ma'am step outside and arrested her she said what am I
[1:03:47.920 --> 1:03:52.960]  being arrested for so on so forth they said well you use a lot of cuss words
[1:03:52.960 --> 1:03:59.480]  and they took her to jail she also then lost her job and the whole thing was a
[1:03:59.480 --> 1:04:03.600]  big mess you know and by the way they don't even have to get a conviction
[1:04:03.600 --> 1:04:09.480]  they get federal grant money for every domestic disturbance call and so but
[1:04:09.480 --> 1:04:14.240]  but you go ahead that was my other question do they get right do they get
[1:04:14.240 --> 1:04:19.720]  money for coming out or making arrests well they got two million cops and
[1:04:19.720 --> 1:04:23.480]  they're not allowed to go out to car robberies or anything serious they're

[1:08:38.360 --> 1:08:45.160]  decisions. Mercury containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two
[1:08:45.160 --> 1:08:49.080]  new studies in the journal pediatrics. These new studies suggest that the
[1:08:49.080 --> 1:08:52.520]  opposite that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved
[1:08:52.520 --> 1:08:56.480]  behavior and mental performance. Fluoride in water is supposed to fight tooth
[1:08:56.480 --> 1:09:01.720]  decay but could it also cause cancer? Yeah the government had the right under
[1:09:01.720 --> 1:09:05.880]  US law to conduct secret testing on the American public under a specific
[1:09:05.880 --> 1:09:10.920]  condition. We have to work with dark side while we spend time in the shadows. Any
[1:09:10.920 --> 1:09:15.960]  attempt to achieve world order must be the work of the devil. Well join me and
[1:09:15.960 --> 1:09:21.080]  I'm glad to sit here at the right hand to see. There's a need for a new world order.
[1:09:21.080 --> 1:09:40.720]  Someday in the next few years a solution will emerge. You want hell? You're going to
[1:09:40.720 --> 1:09:47.280]  get it. All of you that are serving evil are gonna beg for your lives as hell
[1:09:47.280 --> 1:09:55.080]  literally swallows you. Oh you want hell? You're gonna find out it's not pretty
[1:09:55.080 --> 1:10:04.480]  it's not sexy. It's dead bodies and vultures as far as the eye can see. Hell
[1:10:04.480 --> 1:10:11.640]  is being released. This is only the beginning. You're only seeing the storm
[1:10:11.640 --> 1:10:18.960]  as it approaches. What you think as a tempest is the light breeze of Satan's
[1:10:18.960 --> 1:10:23.640]  Warlock released on earth.
[1:10:23.960 --> 1:10:35.080]  To hear Walter Cronkite hail Satan. The dark force is now upon us. The host of
[1:10:35.080 --> 1:10:44.800]  hell are being loosed. The hedge is being removed. Alright going back ladies and
[1:10:44.800 --> 1:10:53.080]  gentlemen this tyranny is designed for the general public the good the decent.
[1:10:53.080 --> 1:10:58.840]  The behavior you see on the honey movers where Ralph Cramden the bus driver
[1:10:58.840 --> 1:11:07.240]  yells at his wife and says honey shut up to the moon without a rocket. Normal
[1:11:07.240 --> 1:11:14.360]  behavior that occasionally happens has been called abnormal but police tazoring
[1:11:14.360 --> 1:11:19.720]  a woman who's chained down till she dies is normal. The government putting
[1:11:19.720 --> 1:11:23.880]  children on Prozac if they know causes massive psychotic breaks and mass
[1:11:23.880 --> 1:11:30.040]  killings even on their own insert now that is normal but being a regular
[1:11:30.040 --> 1:11:36.920]  family is looked down upon and called bad. And yeah it's all 50 states. Here's
[1:11:36.920 --> 1:11:44.080]  an example of quotas. About half the budget of local CPS workers shall
[1:11:44.080 --> 1:11:47.080]  protect the services different names around the country. Department of
[1:11:47.080 --> 1:11:50.200]  Families now they have it for old people have for everybody under the
[1:11:50.200 --> 1:11:53.520]  environmental system they're gonna have three times the social workers they say
[1:11:53.520 --> 1:11:57.960]  watching your backyard your environmental behavior banning barbecue pits
[1:11:57.960 --> 1:12:02.360]  micromanaging everything shutting down family farms and ranches just running
[1:12:02.360 --> 1:12:06.760]  around I mean literal just just just that's the new jobs half the public's
[1:12:06.760 --> 1:12:10.400]  gonna be working for them. They're gonna wear gray uniforms I remember even
[1:12:10.400 --> 1:12:15.320]  seeing that it's just people in gray uniforms everywhere and their bosses in
[1:12:15.320 --> 1:12:21.640]  black. It's all gonna be standardized. Most police will wear masks I mean it's
[1:12:21.640 --> 1:12:25.920]  just it's just gonna be just hellish just feeding on us this is a criminal
[1:12:25.920 --> 1:12:33.680]  wonderland and Bill Clinton signed this Families Adoption Act sounds real
[1:12:33.680 --> 1:12:43.920]  friendly in 98 and it said that they have to increase by around 25% each year
[1:12:43.920 --> 1:12:49.560]  the number of children taken from homes and adopted just to get the base funding
[1:12:49.560 --> 1:12:55.440]  they got the year before but then if they meet certain quotas of above and
[1:12:55.440 --> 1:13:01.800]  beyond and if they can get 50% more each year go and go read the law for
[1:13:01.800 --> 1:13:08.160]  yourself that they then get even more funding and so they hire more social
[1:13:08.160 --> 1:13:17.520]  workers and it's exponential and that's what they do and now they admit the
[1:13:17.520 --> 1:13:25.560]  doctors all spy on your kids the nurses the schools your child falls off the
[1:13:25.560 --> 1:13:29.280]  trampoline falls off the jungle gym at school that matters even witnesses
[1:13:29.280 --> 1:13:32.280]  they'll usually take your kids that the public's all been trained to be
[1:13:32.280 --> 1:13:35.880]  tattletales I was going to visit family this weekend and these taxes are stopped
[1:13:35.880 --> 1:13:40.120]  in a water burger and this old man walks over and he was kind of a
[1:13:40.120 --> 1:13:47.880]  knitting you know type and he said what happened to your chin son oh is everything
[1:13:47.880 --> 1:13:54.200]  or people nice to you and I just looked at him and I'm right there 90% chance he
[1:13:54.200 --> 1:13:58.240]  was a pedophile but see it's the loving thing he was going to do and he looked at
[1:13:58.240 --> 1:14:01.200]  me because my son at school in front of witnesses all we have all the witnesses
[1:14:01.200 --> 1:14:04.840]  you know fell off the jungle bars going across they always talk about happens
[1:14:04.840 --> 1:14:08.280]  every kid and just hit under his chin on some gravel has a little scratch under
[1:14:08.280 --> 1:14:13.760]  there doesn't matter honed in you know here comes this predator flapping over
[1:14:13.760 --> 1:14:20.160]  you know with his nilly self you flatten demon lance and then see that's the
[1:14:20.160 --> 1:14:26.880]  demons excuse to get in your life and I saw him taking interest in my car and
[1:14:26.880 --> 1:14:31.640]  stuff and that's what they do so yes the neighbors heard your wife or girlfriend
[1:14:31.640 --> 1:14:36.960]  screaming I'm sick of you I'm sick of you Chris don't come back then don't you
[1:14:36.960 --> 1:14:40.640]  come back here tonight if you're not gonna talk to me you know cuz she's
[1:14:40.640 --> 1:14:44.520]  having hormones or whatever mammals do that it's normal it's not good we need
[1:14:44.520 --> 1:14:50.120]  to learn and not to do it because it's too dangerous and I know I know probably
[1:14:50.120 --> 1:14:53.560]  1015 people who don't even touch each other or they'll be in the front yard
[1:14:53.560 --> 1:14:58.200]  and scream at each other or you know the woman will run out front and be going
[1:14:58.200 --> 1:15:01.920]  leave me alone bill you know I'm leaving you get out of the house or the woman
[1:15:01.920 --> 1:15:04.800]  will throw a fit and throw some of your goods out we all know how they behave
[1:15:04.800 --> 1:15:09.560]  sometimes you know men do stuff too but that's women act out you know smashing
[1:15:09.560 --> 1:15:12.720]  the dishes and women are known to do that well the woman starts throwing your
[1:15:12.720 --> 1:15:15.640]  stuff on the front lawn it's over folks police are coming no violence now
[1:15:15.640 --> 1:15:19.760]  they're told under federal mandates to get the money they have to meet a quota
[1:15:19.760 --> 1:15:23.400]  and they're told you will be fired you will be disciplined officers if you don't
[1:15:23.400 --> 1:15:28.080]  arrest somebody they come to a domestic disturbance someone will be now if you
[1:15:28.080 --> 1:15:30.280]  happen to have an argument in the front yard or something once a year or
[1:15:30.280 --> 1:15:37.480]  something happens be safe get in the car and leave you know settle down hey
[1:15:37.480 --> 1:15:43.480]  women you can't do that if you've got kids they're gonna take your kids you
[1:15:43.480 --> 1:15:48.000]  can't slap him you can't take the risk that he's gonna hit you back and then
[1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:51.880]  you have been taught by the sitcoms and dramas to go call the cops or women will
[1:15:51.880 --> 1:15:54.560]  you know it's very common threaten to call the cops on even if you haven't
[1:15:54.560 --> 1:15:59.640]  touched them they're taught that by the CIA Gloria Steinem that every man's an
[1:15:59.640 --> 1:16:02.720]  abuser that even if you're married that when you have sex you're being raped
[1:16:02.720 --> 1:16:07.840]  just total total divide and conquer okay and so women by and large have this
[1:16:07.840 --> 1:16:11.840]  programming that men are the enemy and women are the enemy for men and blacks
[1:16:11.840 --> 1:16:15.080]  are the enemy and whites are the enemy and this group and that group of northern
[1:16:15.080 --> 1:16:18.720]  southern child against parent and they tell kids to tattle on your parents and
[1:16:18.720 --> 1:16:23.400]  kids to sue your parents and and the kids so many cases that you know they'll be
[1:16:23.400 --> 1:16:26.760]  12 years old in public school mom's a Christian she says I don't want that
[1:16:26.760 --> 1:16:31.120]  lesbian gay stuff taught to you she goes and complains and then that in the
[1:16:31.120 --> 1:16:34.160]  famous case that girl in Oregon they took her and actually sold her into
[1:16:34.160 --> 1:16:37.720]  public sex slavery and though and the lesbians beat the mother up when she
[1:16:37.720 --> 1:16:40.940]  finally got the child because they were local cops up on the front of the
[1:16:40.940 --> 1:16:43.920]  courthouse steps and nothing was done and took the girl and she was never seen
[1:16:43.920 --> 1:16:51.320]  again I mean it is a lawless system ladies and gentlemen and this is how
[1:16:51.320 --> 1:16:57.120]  they operate and so of course the neighbor heard you screaming they called
[1:16:57.120 --> 1:17:02.000]  the cops that's what they oh an excuse to dial 911 I saw hundreds of
[1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:07.720]  billboards and TV ads there's probably violence going on and so they called the
[1:17:07.720 --> 1:17:11.160]  cops and on the off chance you didn't get out of the house to do the smart
[1:17:11.160 --> 1:17:16.600]  thing you should have not opened the door then they'll call a SWAT team and a
[1:17:16.600 --> 1:17:19.800]  lot of times the cops are lazy at first they're out in the front you just go out
[1:17:19.800 --> 1:17:25.240]  the back door go out the alley and go for a walk and then they run up to you
[1:17:25.240 --> 1:17:29.440]  freaking out saying get down and down and say what are you doing and then and
[1:17:29.440 --> 1:17:32.760]  then you don't volunteer that you were talking loud and cussing a little bit
[1:17:32.760 --> 1:17:38.280]  of cussing going on in your house you don't do that in America now if you want
[1:17:38.280 --> 1:17:42.960]  to turn the HBO up during a comedian Chris Rock cussing that's okay but let me
[1:17:42.960 --> 1:17:51.640]  go ahead and take you down you see that's what it's all about so Chris that's
[1:17:51.640 --> 1:17:57.360]  what happened to you and you know all the women out there the man isn't gonna
[1:17:57.360 --> 1:18:03.600]  help you so stop calling the man now if a hubby is beating the daylights out of
[1:18:03.600 --> 1:18:08.880]  you that's why family is important and you need to go to your family I mean

[1:22:48.320 --> 1:22:52.480]  brother the ideology powering the democrats and republicans is not

[1:22:56.960 --> 1:23:01.000]  good for the american empire instead of what's fair for the american people the
[1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:05.120]  only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism which is why you should

[1:34:44.960 --> 1:34:52.800]  hi I'm calling with a eugenics alert slash update I've spoke to you about the
[1:34:52.800 --> 1:34:58.440]  water before and what I found out in my research is that 30% by the way do we
[1:34:58.440 --> 1:35:04.280]  post your article no you didn't say no no no send it again to Aaron info wars
[1:35:04.280 --> 1:35:09.360]  calm today and I will make sure it gets posted okay you bet and it will no no
[1:35:09.360 --> 1:35:15.440]  it will get posted Aaron at info wars dot com right now and so the update is
[1:35:15.440 --> 1:35:21.560]  that they're they're replacing chlorine with more dangerous chemical to
[1:35:21.560 --> 1:35:28.160]  sanitize styrenes and chloramines the very specific chemical and the way that
[1:35:28.160 --> 1:35:31.760]  I found out about it was I I was gonna write an article about how when you
[1:35:31.760 --> 1:35:37.760]  smell a chlorinated smell coming from a swimming pool that that's not chlorine
[1:35:37.760 --> 1:35:42.760]  that's actually chloramine that's when chlorine binds with ammonia yes very
[1:35:42.760 --> 1:35:47.880]  very it irritates your skin it it it it it binds with the urine that the kids
[1:35:47.880 --> 1:35:52.240]  are urinating in the pool that's right in the creek and it creates chloramines
[1:35:52.240 --> 1:35:56.280]  now what they've done is and this is in Austin I've done the research so often
[1:35:56.280 --> 1:36:00.720]  has using chloramine not chlorine anymore here's the danger that
[1:36:00.720 --> 1:36:09.440]  chloramine can cause anemia when it enters the bloodstream of course yes
[1:36:09.440 --> 1:36:13.680]  anything they can to hurt us they're doing it is a major deal and so you know
[1:36:13.680 --> 1:36:17.320]  basically I mean I'm I'm like I think I'm gonna have to stop taking hot showers
[1:36:17.320 --> 1:36:21.960]  because you breathe it you got to get a shower filter and then it only reduces
[1:36:21.960 --> 1:36:26.760]  it there's a big there's a website called chloramine.org and there's a big
[1:36:26.760 --> 1:36:29.680]  kind of movement that people are starting to understand well we want
[1:36:29.680 --> 1:36:33.240]  listeners to write articles and I don't know why we didn't post it but we'll
[1:36:33.240 --> 1:36:37.920]  make sure also send it to Paul Watson send it to Curtin Emo we'll make sure
[1:36:37.920 --> 1:36:43.360]  your report gets up bet and I have one more thing to say on that note you know
[1:36:43.360 --> 1:36:47.960]  of course anybody who's a intravenous drug user shouldn't be doing that in the
[1:36:47.960 --> 1:36:52.160]  first place but if you're if those people are doing tap water and they're
[1:36:52.160 --> 1:36:58.720]  injecting chloramine straight into their bloodstream they will get anemia and it
[1:36:58.720 --> 1:37:03.080]  will make them very very sick so and then if they get anemia I appreciate your
[1:37:03.080 --> 1:37:08.160]  call Bayer will give you factor 8 every shot filled with HIV and hepatitis
[1:37:08.160 --> 1:37:12.800]  knowingly shipping it oh yeah they're admitted convicted it's a fact knowingly
[1:37:12.800 --> 1:37:16.680]  they knew it would kill everyone and they did because that's who we're dealing
[1:37:16.680 --> 1:37:21.720]  with here again you have to wrap your mind around that they want you dead
[1:37:21.720 --> 1:37:26.360]  it's like James Bond says to Goldfinger you expect me to talk and he says no Mr.
[1:37:26.360 --> 1:37:33.120]  Bond I expect you to die and they see us as a scourge they want to hurt us any
[1:37:33.120 --> 1:37:36.480]  way they can they own the big medical institutions the average doctor doesn't
[1:37:36.480 --> 1:37:39.360]  even know what's happening and it's there to get you in their system and
[1:37:39.360 --> 1:37:44.920]  extract all your wealth out that way while reducing your lifespan and again a
[1:37:44.920 --> 1:37:49.200]  fish will not live in tap water but we drink it can you put two plus two
[1:37:49.200 --> 1:37:52.560]  together not even the fluoride the chlorine and all the other things it
[1:37:52.560 --> 1:37:59.760]  breaks down into and they know I mean they add things they know we're deadly
[1:37:59.760 --> 1:38:04.680]  poison to it on purpose to brain damage you and your family we have the
[1:38:04.680 --> 1:38:08.640]  documents we've covered it here on air we've had guests on we've written
[1:38:08.640 --> 1:38:12.920]  stories with all the proof on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com for
[1:38:12.920 --> 1:38:14.920]  him
[1:38:19.360 --> 1:38:25.640]  it's the way the new world order operates it's the way they roll okay let's go
[1:38:25.640 --> 1:38:32.240]  ahead now and go to Dave in Iowa you're on the air hi yeah but no real real tape

[1:38:56.320 --> 1:39:00.560]  taped it off but all that old stuff's really cool you could put it up on

[1:39:06.760 --> 1:39:09.800]  wouldn't be interested if I send it to you or I don't have a real real player
[1:39:09.800 --> 1:39:15.360]  oh yeah I could get one but pretty interested they're bringing in Oswald
[1:39:15.360 --> 1:39:21.640]  and into others some of it they're bringing in Oswald and all reporters
[1:39:21.640 --> 1:39:26.880]  re-own at Oswald he was one to kill a candidate and he fully answers that he
[1:39:26.880 --> 1:39:33.440]  says I'm a patsy he's a patsy yeah he's a patsy he's being shut up yeah that's
[1:39:33.440 --> 1:39:38.280]  what he said and so they execute him in public now yeah they run things that's
[1:39:38.280 --> 1:39:41.960]  the way it is yeah yeah I agree with you and we're gonna drink poison when they
[1:39:41.960 --> 1:39:44.720]  say so we're gonna take poison and we're gonna die because we love the
[1:39:44.720 --> 1:39:50.840]  government yeah that's true yeah yeah I agree with you anything else Dave I'll

[1:39:57.320 --> 1:40:00.400]  that old stuff you got folks upload it to YouTube if you don't know how get your
[1:40:00.400 --> 1:40:09.680]  neighbor to it's real easy let's go ahead and talk to who's up next year Charles
[1:40:09.680 --> 1:40:16.440]  in Michigan you're on the air how's it going Alex good we have a couple of
[1:40:16.440 --> 1:40:20.800]  criminals running our government here in Michigan we have a Canadian lady by the
[1:40:20.800 --> 1:40:24.880]  name of Grandholm running the government she's the governor and we have a
[1:40:24.880 --> 1:40:29.600]  gentleman named Kwame Kilpatrick running the city of Detroit here he's up on
[1:40:29.600 --> 1:40:33.440]  perjury charges and things with that nature I just wanted to put that out
[1:40:33.440 --> 1:40:36.480]  there and let you guys know that we have a couple of criminals a couple of fun
[1:40:36.480 --> 1:40:39.600]  is running our guy well at least you don't have the son of a top Nazi running
[1:40:39.600 --> 1:40:45.520]  your government like California does oh we might as well have one on another
[1:40:45.520 --> 1:40:49.880]  note I did want to know about the second amendment case that happened last week
[1:40:49.880 --> 1:40:53.760]  that we had the gentleman right down the street down into legal Ohio he was the
[1:40:53.760 --> 1:40:56.920]  one who I do the case I wanted to know how that came out I know you probably
[1:40:56.920 --> 1:41:00.880]  stormed it a lot I just want to know how to okay okay well they haven't ruled yet
[1:41:00.880 --> 1:41:03.880]  but they have the oral arguments and a bunch of justice has spoke on it and
[1:41:03.880 --> 1:41:06.640]  some of them said they believe all guns should be banned which would terrify
[1:41:06.640 --> 1:41:10.080]  everybody the White House entered a briefing for the case saying they believe
[1:41:10.080 --> 1:41:14.000]  that you have a right to own guns but the government can ban them so that that's
[1:41:14.000 --> 1:41:19.480]  the official statement and so they're gonna rule that that DC can't ban
[1:41:19.480 --> 1:41:23.560]  everything but that but they can ban some things and then that'll be used as a
[1:41:23.560 --> 1:41:27.600]  national precedent but it'll be billed as a second amendment victory when it
[1:41:27.600 --> 1:41:31.920]  will be the greatest blow ever so that's how their propaganda works so they don't
[1:41:31.920 --> 1:41:35.240]  want to mobilize the gun owners to get politically active they've got to use
[1:41:35.240 --> 1:41:41.440]  their Judas Goat to fool everybody till it's too late of the NRA yeah I heard
[1:41:41.440 --> 1:41:45.960]  that the NRA wasn't uh wasn't uh all this cracked up to be also well it's a
[1:41:45.960 --> 1:41:51.880]  vicious hateful anti-gun organization much more effective and wicked than
[1:41:51.880 --> 1:41:56.140]  handgun control incorporated and gunners of America at our challenging has now
[1:41:56.140 --> 1:41:59.720]  gotten all the documents and put it out they offered they authored all the major
[1:41:59.720 --> 1:42:07.320]  federal gun control bills they did it they supported the last one the the the
[1:42:07.320 --> 1:42:13.200]  pro-gun brief before the Supreme Court says they believe guns can be banned the
[1:42:13.200 --> 1:42:19.400]  pro-gun brief is is anti-gun see that just exactly what the Constitution
[1:42:19.400 --> 1:42:24.760]  opposes everything's lies everything is spin it's just it's no wonder the
[1:42:24.760 --> 1:42:30.080]  public can't figure it out I mean it's just incredible you keep it up you keep
[1:42:30.080 --> 1:42:34.400]  on getting on that bullhorn and I've seen in-game I'm watching watching it
[1:42:34.400 --> 1:42:38.720]  right now as we speak excellent movie I hope everybody get a chance to watch it
[1:42:38.720 --> 1:42:42.360]  and I'll be spreading it and like so you keep it up thank you sir I really

[1:42:47.720 --> 1:42:54.600]  we'll get to the colors are holding here in a moment but I played this Sunday but
[1:42:54.600 --> 1:43:01.440]  I want to play this again this is a private security company quite large
[1:43:01.440 --> 1:43:07.480]  they have lobbied Homeland Security they have lobbied the airlines and things
[1:43:07.480 --> 1:43:12.360]  like this are being looked at and considered and this is like in the
[1:43:12.360 --> 1:43:17.480]  running man where you wear a bracelet that shocks you into submission they
[1:43:17.480 --> 1:43:21.200]  already have a shock bracelets and things and shock anklets and shock
[1:43:21.200 --> 1:43:27.960]  necklaces for prisoners but everyone your daughter your son old ladies vets when
[1:43:27.960 --> 1:43:31.360]  you go to the airport these are fitted on to you and then quote that stops
[1:43:31.360 --> 1:43:35.840]  hijackers again don't arm the pilots don't have bulkheads of course that's
[1:43:35.840 --> 1:43:41.120]  not even real 9-11 was staged I mean do you really believe people wouldn't try
[1:43:41.120 --> 1:43:44.960]  to subdue a couple guys with box cutters I know I'm on the plane somebody pulls
[1:43:44.960 --> 1:43:48.680]  out a box cutter and says I mean folks I've had people pull knives on me and
[1:43:48.680 --> 1:43:52.760]  I'm not saying I'm tough it's kind of scary that I can't control myself I just
[1:43:52.760 --> 1:43:56.840]  love attacking people that threaten me I like get off on it I mean I just you
[1:43:56.840 --> 1:44:01.840]  pull a knife on me I'm gonna attack you and so what have you stabbed me it's
[1:44:01.840 --> 1:44:08.760]  hard to hurt some let's just get me excited and that's how much that's not
[1:44:08.760 --> 1:44:15.480]  abnormal that was normal in the past I guess I didn't get enough dioxins to
[1:44:15.480 --> 1:44:19.840]  make me you know to geld me I got enough testosterone but I mean I'm on a plane
[1:44:19.840 --> 1:44:24.280]  and and and and and and I mean I'm the sweetest nicest person but somebody
[1:44:24.280 --> 1:44:31.120]  actually threatens my life I mean it's like it's it's crazy what happens I
[1:44:31.120 --> 1:44:35.360]  mean and that's normal you know all these documented stories of little women
[1:44:35.360 --> 1:44:39.560]  picking up cars when it's on their baby I mean somebody pulls a knife on me
[1:44:39.560 --> 1:44:46.840]  folks everything turns into slow motion and they always are freaked out when
[1:44:46.840 --> 1:44:51.520]  you go after them and you let them lunge and you just dive out of the jump out
[1:44:51.520 --> 1:44:55.840]  of the way grab their arm and it's just like when you've got that type of
[1:44:55.840 --> 1:44:58.480]  adrenaline going I don't know when I get old of all have this type of strength
[1:44:58.480 --> 1:45:03.360]  but I don't have this until I'm under attack that it's literally taking their
[1:45:03.360 --> 1:45:07.800]  arm and just dislocating it just pulling it all the way back and around then
[1:45:07.800 --> 1:45:13.280]  they scream in pain and then I never you know really focused on what I was doing
[1:45:13.280 --> 1:45:17.880]  it's all instinctive and then you just you just go ahead and you punch them
[1:45:17.880 --> 1:45:22.200]  right in the nose to get them down and then you just start stomping them you
[1:45:22.200 --> 1:45:26.560]  just pow pow pow hit them in the head with a with a heel and it's over there
[1:45:26.560 --> 1:45:30.760]  they're going to the hospital they're lucky folks most of time they're gonna
[1:45:30.760 --> 1:45:36.040]  pushing up daisies now there are a lot of men like that still on an airplane you
[1:45:36.040 --> 1:45:40.160]  believe with a whole bunch of people on an airplane three four guys are running
[1:45:40.160 --> 1:45:42.560]  around with box cutters everybody's gonna start I mean maybe we're that
[1:45:42.560 --> 1:45:53.160]  cowardly now but I mean you pull some box cutter out on me I mean you're I mean
[1:45:53.160 --> 1:46:03.560]  you know give me a break folks give me a break I mean I've been stabbed I have I've
[1:46:03.560 --> 1:46:09.120]  been hitting the head with a lead pipe the whole nine yards and I just and I
[1:46:09.120 --> 1:46:11.400]  mean let me tell you something a lot of times I got in fights the people could
[1:46:11.400 --> 1:46:15.240]  be just as crazy as I was growing up in Dallas I mean there's guys all over the
[1:46:15.240 --> 1:46:18.760]  place with just cans of whoop ass you wouldn't believe ladies and gentlemen
[1:46:18.760 --> 1:46:23.200]  that's why I'm not looking for fights there's people that have that normal-looking
[1:46:23.200 --> 1:46:28.800]  guy over there painting the house across from your street you know that that
[1:46:28.800 --> 1:46:37.960]  you know the quiet guy that Mosier yard now the guys on Roy strutting around act
[1:46:37.960 --> 1:46:42.080]  and tough they can never it's something about it the guys that want to be tough
[1:46:42.080 --> 1:46:52.160]  are never tough and then the guys that see most people have a a lot of people
[1:46:52.160 --> 1:46:56.400]  have an instinct that they suppress or they hold back they don't go full speed
[1:46:56.400 --> 1:46:59.960]  looks you go full speed I don't know why I'm getting off into it I start thinking
[1:46:59.960 --> 1:47:04.040]  about it I start thinking about that's why I go off into that hyperbole the point
[1:47:04.040 --> 1:47:09.360]  is I see somebody pull a box cutter on me how do I even get off into that story
[1:47:09.360 --> 1:47:18.240]  oh yeah I was talking about the the bracelets and you got this bracelet on
[1:47:18.240 --> 1:47:21.840]  we're all gonna be good little slaves good little prisoners good little cattle
[1:47:21.840 --> 1:47:27.000]  a bunch of ninny and cowards when the real threat is and has always been the
[1:47:27.000 --> 1:47:30.600]  government what the founding fathers tell you what it what does history show
[1:47:30.600 --> 1:47:33.880]  you and so in this piece we're not gonna play all five minutes of it for time
[1:47:33.880 --> 1:47:37.480]  constraints but they start out with retina scanning is good and searching you
[1:47:37.480 --> 1:47:43.400]  and data mining is good but on top of it we all need the shock taser bracelets
[1:47:43.400 --> 1:47:48.960]  and they all use terms I don't call it electrocution or shock they give it you
[1:47:48.960 --> 1:47:54.120]  know a scientific term and they call it the safety bracelet and it's all and for
[1:47:54.120 --> 1:47:56.920]  three minutes you know they're talking calmly about other airport security and
[1:47:56.920 --> 1:48:01.720]  they just slip in oh how wonderful it is we'll all wear our bracelet this is all
[1:48:01.720 --> 1:48:06.560]  written by a psychologist on how to sell you on something just off the charts
[1:48:06.560 --> 1:48:12.360]  dystopic novel here it is is there a solution to deterring hijackers once
[1:48:12.360 --> 1:48:19.240]  they are on the aircraft yes there is a very viable workable answer it starts
[1:48:19.240 --> 1:48:24.840]  here when passengers are issued their tickets at that time they can also be
[1:48:24.840 --> 1:48:29.360]  fitted with a special electronic ID bracelet that they will wear until they
[1:48:29.360 --> 1:48:34.040]  disembark the flight at their destination these electronic coated
[1:48:34.040 --> 1:48:38.560]  bracelets will make traveling much more convenient for the public it will
[1:48:38.560 --> 1:48:42.440]  replace the need to carry a ticket by containing all pertinent passenger
[1:48:42.440 --> 1:48:47.080]  information in addition the bracelet could permit tracking of the passenger
[1:48:47.080 --> 1:48:53.400]  through the terminal including carry-on luggage checked luggage can be coded to
[1:48:53.400 --> 1:48:58.520]  match the bracelet to ensure no tampering or diversions by further
[1:48:58.520 --> 1:49:03.040]  equipping each bracelet with EMD technology the bracelets will allow
[1:49:03.040 --> 1:49:07.760]  crew members using radio frequency transmitters to quickly and effectively
[1:49:07.760 --> 1:49:12.920]  subdue hijackers the electro muscular disruption signal overrides the
[1:49:12.920 --> 1:49:16.920]  attackers central nervous system and will render even the most elite and
[1:49:16.920 --> 1:49:21.560]  aggressive terrorist completely immobile for several minutes this will
[1:49:21.560 --> 1:49:27.280]  allow the crew to subdue and handcuff that individual EMD technology is
[1:49:27.280 --> 1:49:32.000]  designed to incapacitate a target from a safe distance without causing
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:37.640]  permanent injury which means these criminals will survive and go to trial
[1:49:37.640 --> 1:49:42.440]  the bracelet would only be armed by someone on board upon confirmation
[1:49:42.440 --> 1:49:48.560]  that a takeover situation exists to a businessman on his way home to be
[1:49:48.560 --> 1:49:53.080]  reunited with his family or to a young family going south for a winter holiday
[1:49:53.080 --> 1:49:58.240]  wearing an EMD safety bracelet for a few hours during a flight is a small
[1:49:58.240 --> 1:50:02.880]  inconvenience to ensure their safe arrival we feel have given the choice
[1:50:02.880 --> 1:50:07.320]  between taking a flight employing the added security of the EMD safety
[1:50:07.320 --> 1:50:12.160]  bracelet system and taking a flight without the additional security many if

[1:50:17.680 --> 1:50:25.240]  bracelet now in the longer piece they talk about the militants see a militant
[1:50:25.240 --> 1:50:29.200]  is a term you can use on some I just protesting and yelling and they
[1:50:29.200 --> 1:50:33.680]  interchange it with murdering terrorist show that when they use the word
[1:50:33.680 --> 1:50:37.400]  militant on you you can't sue them for saying you're a terrorist but it's
[1:50:37.400 --> 1:50:42.040]  psychologically it has the same meaning as terrorists now that whole thing was

[1:55:57.280 --> 1:56:04.640]  on the air yeah hi Alex hey buddy hey yeah I was calling and referenced to some
[1:56:04.640 --> 1:56:10.160]  TTC news trans Texas quarter from San Antonio CNN says it doesn't exist at
[1:56:10.160 --> 1:56:13.600]  matter there's billboards and tall roads everywhere that matters TV ads for it
[1:56:13.600 --> 1:56:16.400]  here it doesn't exist have you heard that CNN newscast or they say it doesn't
[1:56:16.400 --> 1:56:22.400]  exist yeah absolutely I was just that it doesn't exist learn no I'm serious man
[1:56:22.400 --> 1:56:27.600]  yeah I wanted to come Mercury's good for you everything's fine gun
[1:56:27.600 --> 1:56:32.440]  confiscations good and it doesn't exist sorry go ahead yeah yeah and now I just
[1:56:32.440 --> 1:56:37.120]  seen recently on the news that it seems like they're kind of trying to do a
[1:56:37.120 --> 1:56:40.880]  sleight of hand where they are saying that a local aquifer group is gonna
[1:56:40.880 --> 1:56:46.000]  threaten litigation drag out the process and eventually Centra will no longer
[1:56:46.000 --> 1:56:49.840]  want to do the toll road yeah and that's pure bold they will they will lose the
[1:56:49.840 --> 1:56:54.840]  case on purpose exactly what I was they bring in they always do it they bring
[1:56:54.840 --> 1:56:58.800]  in false opposition to lose the case standard business operating yeah
[1:56:58.800 --> 1:57:03.440]  exactly completely distracts from the point that the San Antonio voters had
[1:57:03.440 --> 1:57:07.320]  no say over any of this toll road right now and that we've already been tacked
[1:57:07.320 --> 1:57:10.680]  and they're taking a bunch of your existing roads and official maps and
[1:57:10.680 --> 1:57:14.640]  like they told us here in Austin moped back they said will never be a toll
[1:57:14.640 --> 1:57:18.200]  road it's a conspiracy theory and then now they announced three months ago that
[1:57:18.200 --> 1:57:22.000]  it will be a toll road absolutely it's but then if you say you don't want it
[1:57:22.000 --> 1:57:25.440]  they'll laugh at you and say it doesn't exist I mean it's just classic
[1:57:25.440 --> 1:57:31.440]  military op definitely it's like I'm it's like I'm watching a Kubrick movie or
[1:57:31.440 --> 1:57:35.280]  something just unbelievable it's crazy I just I wanted a real quick plug a
[1:57:35.280 --> 1:57:39.920]  website and see if I could ask you just your thoughts on something that I came

[2:00:01.520 --> 2:00:09.680]  the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones all right I
[2:00:09.680 --> 2:00:13.360]  got more your calls coming up a bunch of audio clips tons of news haven't even
[2:00:13.360 --> 2:00:18.320]  gotten to yet does anybody want to comment on police all over the country
[2:00:18.320 --> 2:00:21.800]  going door-to-door trying to intimidate their way in to search to see if you have
[2:00:21.800 --> 2:00:27.640]  quote illegal guns guilty until proven innocent spot checks like the Soviet Union
[2:00:27.640 --> 2:00:32.840]  Nazi Germany you see we're already acclimated they just do it and do it
[2:00:32.840 --> 2:00:36.920]  until we're acclimated I mean I heard cops on other shows last night calling
[2:00:36.920 --> 2:00:40.080]  in freaking out over and I know you don't want to be part of this I'd like to
[2:00:40.080 --> 2:00:46.280]  hear from the good officers that are out there at 1-800-259-9231 I got a
[2:00:46.280 --> 2:00:48.760]  skip ahead of people in a minute because somebody disagrees with me on the
[2:00:48.760 --> 2:00:54.440]  Second Amendment Jeff and Indiana's will go to him but who was I talking to
[2:00:54.440 --> 2:01:00.440]  Justin in Texas yeah Justin I I really haven't seen everything on YouTube so I
[2:01:00.440 --> 2:01:04.600]  can't comment on what you're saying I know the loose change guys they've made
[2:01:04.600 --> 2:01:10.960]  two versions and they say that you know out of two two-hour films there were
[2:01:10.960 --> 2:01:14.320]  one or two mistakes they made we're just questioning the official story because
[2:01:14.320 --> 2:01:18.240]  it's been proven to be a premeditated lie and I don't specifically know what
[2:01:18.240 --> 2:01:22.560]  you're talking about I know that Dylan tends to be friendly when he's on with
[2:01:22.560 --> 2:01:26.000]  these guys and interviews and he'll say well we're not perfect we we've made
[2:01:26.000 --> 2:01:31.000]  mistakes and they I've seen some clips where they edit those together to try to
[2:01:31.000 --> 2:01:35.720]  because you know we're reasonable they're not but I really don't know but
[2:01:35.720 --> 2:01:38.200]  but you were saying something about dishonesty what is that specifically
[2:01:38.200 --> 2:01:42.920]  yeah basically the what I was trying to get at was I'm a big fan of the we are
[2:01:42.920 --> 2:01:46.520]  change guys and other confrontations and you know they demand the truth they
[2:01:46.520 --> 2:01:51.240]  demand accountability okay and in this debate he's debating with the guy
[2:01:51.240 --> 2:01:56.240]  named Mark Robert okay okay yeah I know that guy he's an absolute demon I've
[2:01:56.240 --> 2:02:01.360]  run into on the streets okay yeah in New York apparently the show doesn't give
[2:02:01.360 --> 2:02:04.360]  any impression that it's not biased as a matter of fact the host says he is
[2:02:04.360 --> 2:02:07.760]  biased at the at the end of the show okay fine we're doing the endless
[2:02:07.760 --> 2:02:12.960]  plug-ins going on what is the question okay and basically my question is as
[2:02:12.960 --> 2:02:17.000]  far as accountability they've got firefighters that are saying that um
[2:02:17.000 --> 2:02:21.600]  they're issues like the EPA breath breathing of the bad air down on
[2:02:21.600 --> 2:02:24.680]  ground zero issues like that that are important are being ignored because
[2:02:24.680 --> 2:02:28.360]  okay what what did you what are you what are you saying that's wrong about the
[2:02:28.360 --> 2:02:32.920]  films I'm saying that there's so many misrepresentations of fireman's quote
[2:02:32.920 --> 2:02:38.240]  and that the guy mark robert as a website is called loose change guide and
[2:02:38.240 --> 2:02:41.800]  what it is it goes step-by-step yeah pretty much debunked and discredits
[2:02:41.800 --> 2:02:46.720]  almost everything in loose change and it's it's I don't want I don't want people
[2:02:46.720 --> 2:02:50.200]  to get the wrong idea but hey listen I don't care and I've heard your point
[2:02:50.200 --> 2:02:56.720]  if you believe that I've had that guy march up to me when I'm at ground zero
[2:02:56.720 --> 2:02:59.640]  and start screaming he says the firefighters blew the building up he
[2:02:59.640 --> 2:03:04.320]  says it he says it just like when I walked up to some communists and I said
[2:03:04.320 --> 2:03:09.440]  why do you believe in communism it's in martial law and they start saying he's
[2:03:09.440 --> 2:03:12.400]  talking mean to this young lady did you hear what he just said to this young
[2:03:12.400 --> 2:03:18.600]  lady that's horrible thing to say so I mean the guy walks up and straw man's
[2:03:18.600 --> 2:03:25.560]  and says I say the firefighters blew up the building it's pure bull he defends
[2:03:25.560 --> 2:03:29.280]  the popular mechanics angle popper mechanics says the Air Force never
[2:03:29.280 --> 2:03:35.080]  intercepted one plane in the year before 9-11 but paying stewards and then we
[2:03:35.080 --> 2:03:39.280]  take the very same norad spokesman they quote and pull up Reuters and AP where he
[2:03:39.280 --> 2:03:44.880]  says 68 times in the year before so I've seen all those arguments I can comment
[2:03:44.880 --> 2:03:48.840]  on what you just said and it's pure bull except for maybe out of hundreds of
[2:03:48.840 --> 2:03:52.520]  things he claims three or four things that loose changes said well we know
[2:03:52.520 --> 2:03:57.560]  we're not exactly right or clear about that hey look man I just know our
[2:03:57.560 --> 2:04:00.680]  governments declassified they stage Gulf of Tonkin and these people still
[2:04:00.680 --> 2:04:05.400]  deny that I know they stage terror attacks to overthrow Iran I know they
[2:04:05.400 --> 2:04:09.040]  wrote up Operation Northwoods I know they stage the USS Liberty and it's now
[2:04:09.040 --> 2:04:12.800]  been declassified by the NSA that Israel knew it was a US ship before they
[2:04:12.800 --> 2:04:18.040]  attacked it I know LBJ ordered those planes back and others people that
[2:04:18.040 --> 2:04:22.480]  still have websites saying we're liars when it's admitted so it's a load of
[2:04:22.480 --> 2:04:31.240]  bull and that's the end up so it doesn't matter it's just a complete waste of
[2:04:31.240 --> 2:04:37.160]  time but hey enjoy your toll roads that CNN says don't exist they say
[2:04:37.160 --> 2:04:42.880]  trans sexist corridor does not exist in Fox CNN and other quotes we've played

[2:06:53.880 --> 2:06:57.720]  doctor and his views on CardiBite I would like to thank you Don for making my

[2:07:11.360 --> 2:07:15.320]  doing there's so much garlic in there that has a yeast killing effect that
[2:07:15.320 --> 2:07:19.040]  yeast is a big problem in the gut pushes the liver heart it also has metal
[2:07:19.040 --> 2:07:22.600]  chelating effect and most of the other herbs in there I find that strengthen the
[2:07:22.600 --> 2:07:26.960]  arteries they help to neutralize free radical your remedy is as close to what
[2:07:26.960 --> 2:07:30.760]  we do in our program as you can get as far as one supplement goes it's working

[2:07:50.960 --> 2:07:57.160]  behind enemy lines the information war continues it's Alex Jones and the G-C-N
[2:07:57.160 --> 2:08:03.680]  radio network okay Jeff and Indiana disagrees with me he goes to the head of
[2:08:03.680 --> 2:08:09.880]  the line pass Brian and David who both come from Canada and others okay Jeff go
[2:08:09.880 --> 2:08:14.000]  ahead hey man I can talk to you I just wanted to tell you I disagree with one
[2:08:14.000 --> 2:08:18.680]  thing I heard you say about guns I heard rents and Jim Mars and all kinds of other
[2:08:18.680 --> 2:08:23.280]  people say the same thing they basically said that in June after the Supreme
[2:08:23.280 --> 2:08:27.360]  Court rules on this gun ban you know if gun bans get instituted everywhere that
[2:08:27.360 --> 2:08:29.920]  there's gonna be some kind of huge resistance and my basic problem with
[2:08:29.920 --> 2:08:35.320]  that is that when Hurricane Katrina happened I saw the government with
[2:08:35.320 --> 2:08:40.000]  without even much effort at all totally disarmed the whole city that's a that's
[2:08:40.000 --> 2:08:45.320]  a straw man because I've what do you mean I said huge resistance I've been
[2:08:45.320 --> 2:08:49.880]  trying to mobilize political resistance to this now saying the people aren't
[2:08:49.880 --> 2:08:55.160]  awake and we've got to raise the alarm and not count on Judas Iscariot also
[2:08:55.160 --> 2:08:59.600]  known as the NRA so that's a straw man you you've you basically claimed that I
[2:08:59.600 --> 2:09:03.720]  said something that I didn't really say no I thought you said that you read it
[2:09:03.720 --> 2:09:06.760]  that it was a part of the globalist plan to have us fight against the police and
[2:09:06.760 --> 2:09:09.880]  that will cream them and then we're going to oh I did say that I'm saying if it
[2:09:09.880 --> 2:09:15.080]  comes to out and out continual nationwide gun confiscation no no sir you
[2:09:15.080 --> 2:09:18.240]  just don't hear about it there are people have shootouts with the cops every
[2:09:18.240 --> 2:09:21.720]  week when they come confiscate guns it's always the same the neighbor said he was
[2:09:21.720 --> 2:09:25.240]  talking about getting out of dollars and buying scoreable food and we think
[2:09:25.240 --> 2:09:29.320]  that's terrorist I mean I literally in the cops and SWAT team you but more and
[2:09:29.320 --> 2:09:33.880]  more people are fighting back against it and I'm telling you I said if one percent
[2:09:33.880 --> 2:09:37.840]  of a hundred plus million gun owners fight back that's a million combatants
[2:09:37.840 --> 2:09:43.840]  and people are getting mad and so so in a way I guess you are right I mean in a
[2:09:43.840 --> 2:09:50.240]  way I guess that I mean I said if it comes to a civil war they mean they
[2:09:50.240 --> 2:09:54.040]  would like to gouge the people into a confrontation and that confrontation
[2:09:54.040 --> 2:09:59.080]  happens the cops that have been taught they're invincible I mean when 9-11
[2:09:59.080 --> 2:10:01.440]  happened for two days you didn't see cops anywhere on the streets they were
[2:10:01.440 --> 2:10:06.680]  freaked out cowering in their police precincts how did how did New Orleans get
[2:10:06.680 --> 2:10:09.960]  disarmed so easy I'm reading a book on it right now called the New Orleans gun
[2:10:09.960 --> 2:10:14.840]  grab which I heard about on GOA radio but um I mean they disarmed the city so
[2:10:14.840 --> 2:10:17.960]  easy makes me wonder how much these hot dog eating Americans are really up for
[2:10:17.960 --> 2:10:23.440]  all that well no I mean 99% will turn in grand Eddie shotguns heirlooms they
[2:10:23.440 --> 2:10:30.320]  will suck the boots of the felon illegal alien troops and 99% will will submit
[2:10:30.320 --> 2:10:35.240]  and will will you know because they love enslave some I appreciate your call but
[2:10:35.240 --> 2:10:40.280]  1% will fight back and New Orleans they held food and water back for four days
[2:10:40.280 --> 2:10:48.320]  all is a laboratory experiment the head of the major parish followed orders as
[2:10:48.320 --> 2:10:52.560]  his mother died over four days in the nursing home and he cried well hey can
[2:10:52.560 --> 2:10:56.760]  you find that Richard clip it's from like two years ago but I bet it's in
[2:10:56.760 --> 2:11:04.320]  there it'll have some headline like crying cop New Orleans or it's on
[2:11:04.320 --> 2:11:10.400]  Google a head of parish you know he says they wouldn't let us in to help he
[2:11:10.400 --> 2:11:14.360]  starts crying I had to watch my mama die well why'd you I mean he followed orders
[2:11:14.360 --> 2:11:20.520]  over his mother and they packed stacked up food at the dome wouldn't send cops
[2:11:20.520 --> 2:11:26.240]  in to help people most the cop force walked off in New Orleans the big easy
[2:11:26.240 --> 2:11:31.920]  is a scum is the most scummy sitting in our country everybody knows that just
[2:11:31.920 --> 2:11:39.440]  open corruption opens it's an open sewer I won't get anywhere near it and it's
[2:11:39.440 --> 2:11:43.440]  always been an open sewer I mean actually I've been there a few times when I was a
[2:11:43.440 --> 2:11:50.160]  kid on tourist stuff but it's an open sewer and so more than half the cops
[2:11:50.160 --> 2:11:55.440]  just walked off on the storm came well cops always walk off on disasters that's
[2:11:55.440 --> 2:12:01.040]  what they do they're trained to take care of themselves and to extract money out
[2:12:01.040 --> 2:12:07.680]  of you so the New Orleans police walked off and then they didn't bring food or
[2:12:07.680 --> 2:12:11.560]  water there's video of them making women show their breasts for food or water and
[2:12:11.560 --> 2:12:14.320]  they went into the high and dry the wealthy people all live on the outside
[2:12:14.320 --> 2:12:17.920]  of the bowl the poor people live down in the bowl but the wealthy people all live
[2:12:17.920 --> 2:12:21.400]  above sea level and they went into there's video of it I mean it had 50
[2:12:21.400 --> 2:12:26.240]  million dollar homes I mean 50 million dollar homes I mean palaces and it show
[2:12:26.240 --> 2:12:29.960]  them walking up in yards with hummers and Mercedes and the people walk out and
[2:12:29.960 --> 2:12:34.360]  say hey well I'm fine and they say got to do a gun confiscation and then they
[2:12:34.360 --> 2:12:38.920]  put you in handcuffs and take your guns you never get them back it's all on
[2:12:38.920 --> 2:12:44.120]  video and the cops divvy them up for themselves most of the time they're
[2:12:44.120 --> 2:12:51.280]  always getting caught selling them back getting in trouble but that was a huge
[2:12:51.280 --> 2:12:56.720]  laboratory experiment so I guess in a way you're right sir maybe we are just
[2:12:56.720 --> 2:13:02.000]  complete coward we probably will roll over to all of it so that's that's us I
[2:13:02.000 --> 2:13:06.680]  mean we're land of the cowards home of the scum and until we admit we're land
[2:13:06.680 --> 2:13:14.080]  of the scum home of the cowards we're not gonna get the country back and they
[2:13:14.080 --> 2:13:18.200]  did confiscate guns and then there was the crazy part about the ABC news pieces
[2:13:18.200 --> 2:13:22.640]  and the Fox pieces this was all psych warfare they'd say the cops don't use
[2:13:22.640 --> 2:13:25.720]  any force but they do ask you to turn your guns in and then it showed them
[2:13:25.720 --> 2:13:31.400]  slamming people down you know lawyers homeowners and the point is they can do
[2:13:31.400 --> 2:13:34.320]  it to poor people they do it to anybody they are it was the rich people they were
[2:13:34.320 --> 2:13:38.720]  there to loot the houses folks and they slam them down their faces and they take
[2:13:38.720 --> 2:13:43.200]  their guns and they say you're not gonna protect your home you're not gonna stay
[2:13:43.200 --> 2:13:46.560]  here we don't care how much food you got you got to go to the Superdome and
[2:13:46.560 --> 2:13:49.640]  that's what's gonna happen when they release a bio weapon or set a new
[2:13:49.640 --> 2:13:53.240]  cough they're gonna lock the cities down not let you get food and then they're
[2:13:53.240 --> 2:13:55.920]  gonna wait till everybody starts starving and coming to the Superdome's
[2:13:55.920 --> 2:13:59.600]  and and where they can then have a helicopter fly over and spray you with
[2:13:59.600 --> 2:14:03.840]  it with the real bio weapon and then this is in a later operation this they
[2:14:03.840 --> 2:14:06.960]  have to gear us up for this the average cops on the ground won't know to they'll
[2:14:06.960 --> 2:14:10.600]  be being sprayed and dying they love it you know they love government I'm not
[2:14:10.600 --> 2:14:13.440]  kidding about this by the way I mean this okay this I'm not joking around this
[2:14:13.440 --> 2:14:18.880]  isn't this isn't a joke and then they'll send the armored teams to the houses and
[2:14:18.880 --> 2:14:25.840]  they're just gonna burn your house down so they'll fire bomb you and then pull
[2:14:25.840 --> 2:14:31.040]  back to safe range and that's America that's what it's all about it's about
[2:14:31.040 --> 2:14:35.280]  the government once and for all extincting resistance it's about siege
[2:14:35.280 --> 2:14:40.840]  it's about domination it's about totally taking us Caesar did it in Gaul and
[2:14:40.840 --> 2:14:46.160]  Germania the Communist Chinese did it in Tibet the Russians did it in Ukraine
[2:14:46.160 --> 2:14:53.480]  the Nazis did it in Poland it's a it's they always do it the same and if you
[2:14:53.480 --> 2:14:57.560]  wanted to know what the government will do they will come for your guns if you've
[2:14:57.560 --> 2:15:02.640]  got you know that's the problem so you can either die in your home as they fire
[2:15:02.640 --> 2:15:08.320]  bomb you and they'll do it they like it it's fun or you can die at the sports
[2:15:08.320 --> 2:15:18.800]  stadium so that's your choice however you want to die okay Brian and Montreal
[2:15:18.800 --> 2:15:24.600]  you're on the air hi Alex hello I'd first like to thank you for waking me up
[2:15:24.600 --> 2:15:30.080]  over a year ago greatly appreciated thank you sir and I also wanted to thank
[2:15:30.080 --> 2:15:32.960]  you for all the news that you keep me informed on because at least once a
[2:15:32.960 --> 2:15:37.520]  week I write all my CBC CTV global a letter asking them why I have to get
[2:15:37.520 --> 2:15:43.160]  my news from alternate sources they never answer me of course I had a few
[2:15:43.160 --> 2:15:47.360]  questions for you the first one I'd heard rumors that there's a possibility
[2:15:47.360 --> 2:15:50.640]  that Montreal will be the base for the North American Union once it's
[2:15:50.640 --> 2:15:54.960]  established well there yeah they're talking about an area in Montreal or in
[2:15:54.960 --> 2:16:00.360]  auto or surrounding areas for the regional capital but the main capital is to
[2:16:00.360 --> 2:16:05.440]  be in Atlanta Georgia okay perfect the second thing I was wondering is if you'd
[2:16:05.440 --> 2:16:09.120]  heard anything about this thing I just heard about it last night called Nisara
[2:16:09.120 --> 2:16:13.920]  yeah it's not real it's not real all government this info to make us think
[2:16:13.920 --> 2:16:16.920]  everything's all right there's a secret group helping us and everything's
[2:16:16.920 --> 2:16:21.680]  wonderful perfect and the last thing I wanted to make a comment about is that I
[2:16:21.680 --> 2:16:25.160]  can say in the last two months I've been doing like even more deeper
[2:16:25.160 --> 2:16:29.800]  investigating and one of the things I came across was that most of this stuff
[2:16:29.800 --> 2:16:34.560]  has been planted and originated from the Catholic Church so that I end up
[2:16:34.560 --> 2:16:38.960]  finding out that whether it's Illuminati Freemason or any other secret
[2:16:38.960 --> 2:16:44.000]  society here's the problem with that and again the Catholic Church at the top
[2:16:44.000 --> 2:16:47.360]  is corrupt the last two popes have called for world government new world
[2:16:47.360 --> 2:16:51.120]  order I'm not saying that all the major institutions aren't taken over and again
[2:16:51.120 --> 2:16:54.600]  I'm not Catholic so I come from this from the outside I've stated it the main
[2:16:54.600 --> 2:16:59.760]  progenitors the people saying the Catholic Church is the source of all evil
[2:16:59.760 --> 2:17:05.280]  are the biggest lying cooks I mean the main leader of them I found out says
[2:17:05.280 --> 2:17:10.480]  the Sun orbits the earth and that we're on some type of tropic of cancer string
[2:17:10.480 --> 2:17:16.360]  yeah and the earth goes up and down I mean totally insane white homelands I
[2:17:16.360 --> 2:17:23.320]  mean I mean folks it gets into I mean flat earthers just nuttier and then the
[2:17:23.320 --> 2:17:26.560]  history so I have to be a history buff to a certain extent history so big
[2:17:26.560 --> 2:17:31.360]  nobody can even you know no one 100th of it but I mean just total bull toe and
[2:17:31.360 --> 2:17:36.840]  the lies about me I mean the law hold on hold on the lies about me and so then I
[2:17:36.840 --> 2:17:41.240]  just say you know and and then they make it all about is it this group or is it
[2:17:41.240 --> 2:17:45.360]  that group and then we've got to obsess on that when all that does is divide and
[2:17:45.360 --> 2:17:49.520]  conquer I'm fighting the NAU whoever's behind it I'm fighting the world order
[2:17:49.520 --> 2:17:52.800]  whoever's behind it and you know their Catholics their process there's Jews
[2:17:52.800 --> 2:17:56.760]  there's Arabs at the Bilderberg group you know it's it's they've got control of
[2:17:56.760 --> 2:18:01.800]  all the major groups so there's no debate about the Catholic Church you know
[2:18:01.800 --> 2:18:05.480]  being run by the New World Order now you can debate when it was was it always run
[2:18:05.480 --> 2:18:11.520]  that way but but I mean it's just an obsession that it I mean it's the same
[2:18:11.520 --> 2:18:16.080]  thing with the Jews stuff I mean I'll make films about Israel at premeditated
[2:18:16.080 --> 2:18:20.480]  Lee attacking the USS Liberty and you know I got a lot to lose doing that
[2:18:20.480 --> 2:18:25.320]  that's a dangerous lobby and man and that ain't enough you know I talk about
[2:18:25.320 --> 2:18:28.920]  how our government was involved as well and the people claim I'm giving Israel a
[2:18:28.920 --> 2:18:34.440]  way out on this no I'm not I'm going after all the perpetrators you know so
[2:18:34.440 --> 2:18:39.000]  it's just it's just not so much of our movement is ego maniacs who want to be
[2:18:39.000 --> 2:18:41.600]  the leader well let me tell you something I don't want to be the leader
[2:18:41.600 --> 2:18:46.160]  because this is a dangerous position to be in I do this though for the right
[2:18:46.160 --> 2:18:50.960]  reasons I'm fired up and that's why I am the leader okay and believe me I don't
[2:18:50.960 --> 2:18:55.280]  like that position okay so see it's classic the person that doesn't want to
[2:18:55.280 --> 2:18:59.440]  be the leader is the leader and so I'm gonna be attacked by every cook and
[2:18:59.440 --> 2:19:04.680]  twit and and freak and liar and and just you know I mean they got these guys

[2:24:27.980 --> 2:24:29.260]  All right, let me cover news now.
[2:24:29.260 --> 2:24:39.740]  I remember Carl Rove saying he was controlled reality and the reporters will just report on
[2:24:39.740 --> 2:24:44.380]  that reality and the White House will then change global reality and that they just report
[2:24:44.380 --> 2:24:49.660]  on that and that we are just spectators and that they run everything and that we mean nothing.
[2:24:49.660 --> 2:24:52.940]  Like Dick Cheney, they said, hey, more than two-thirds of the country disagrees with you
[2:24:52.940 --> 2:24:55.740]  and he just said, so what? Let's go ahead and play that clip.
[2:24:55.740 --> 2:25:02.700]  We talked to the Vice President this morning in Oman. He would not talk about Barack Obama,
[2:25:02.700 --> 2:25:06.380]  but we talked about everything from Iraq to the economy.
[2:25:07.420 --> 2:25:12.060]  Alan Greenspan described it this way. The current financial crisis in the U.S.
[2:25:12.060 --> 2:25:17.980]  is likely to be judged in retrospect as the most wrenching since the end of the Second World War.
[2:25:19.740 --> 2:25:23.260]  Correct? We're clearly going through a rough patch here. There's no question about it.
[2:25:23.260 --> 2:25:30.060]  But we've had prior to that 52 months of uninterrupted economic growth. Now, of course,
[2:25:30.060 --> 2:25:36.700]  we've got problems in the housing industry, mortgage-backed securities so forth that have
[2:25:36.700 --> 2:25:42.460]  created problems that we're having to deal with. Tell me what you said to the Iraqi leadership
[2:25:42.460 --> 2:25:47.260]  and how far you're willing to push them. On the security front, I think there's a general
[2:25:47.260 --> 2:25:53.260]  consensus that we've made major progress, that the surge has worked. That's been a major success.
[2:25:53.260 --> 2:25:57.260]  Two-thirds of Americans say it's not worth fighting.
[2:25:57.900 --> 2:26:01.820]  So? So you don't care what the American people think?
[2:26:01.820 --> 2:26:12.300]  No, I think you cannot be blown off course by the fluctuations in the public opinion polls.
[2:26:12.300 --> 2:26:16.460]  There has, in fact, been fundamental change in transformation and improvement.
[2:26:16.460 --> 2:26:23.260]  Okay. So if you go back to 2000 and 2003, I said they would go in, stay there for decades,
[2:26:23.260 --> 2:26:27.740]  break the country in three parts, that our government, the criminals that run it, would
[2:26:27.740 --> 2:26:30.620]  fund the different groups to kill each other. That's now come out. They've been funding all
[2:26:30.620 --> 2:26:37.580]  the groups mainstream news. And that they would then later turn off the spiky and then claim that
[2:26:37.580 --> 2:26:42.140]  they had won the war by de-escalating violence, which isn't even true. They're cooking all those
[2:26:42.140 --> 2:26:49.340]  numbers. So it's just all complete lies. But you got a bunch of scum, about 30% of the country,
[2:26:49.340 --> 2:26:53.820]  that associates their personal power with the Republicans. And they don't care what happens
[2:26:53.820 --> 2:26:59.260]  to the country or how many guns the president bans or how open the border is. They don't care.
[2:26:59.260 --> 2:27:03.260]  It's about feeling good and feeling like they run things and they're powerful. When you run
[2:27:03.260 --> 2:27:08.300]  nothing, you're nothing. Now it's the same thing, about 30% still support the Democrats. And they'll
[2:27:08.300 --> 2:27:13.180]  tell Hillary Clinton could cut children's heads off and drink their blood on the White House lawn.
[2:27:13.180 --> 2:27:17.660]  They'd praise it. And that's just how it works. That's why we lose and why we're losers. And
[2:27:18.540 --> 2:27:24.140]  we just love being conned and scammed and gamed over and over again. But the majority of us know
[2:27:24.140 --> 2:27:30.700]  it's a lie now. We're not backing off. Okay, two years ago, Google put out a press release. So did
[2:27:30.700 --> 2:27:34.540]  Yahoo and others, Microsoft, that they want to use the cameras and microphones on your
[2:27:34.540 --> 2:27:39.100]  computers and they're already doing it now to listen to you and then market things to you.
[2:27:39.100 --> 2:27:44.300]  And computers will listen for keywords and the computer will translate your audio. You say, you
[2:27:44.300 --> 2:27:49.260]  know, the dog is fat, well, it translates and puts it into text, the dog is fat, or they hear a dog
[2:27:49.260 --> 2:27:54.220]  bark, it pitches dog food ads at your, it knows what TV shows you're watching and it'll pitch the
[2:27:54.220 --> 2:27:59.980]  DVD box set for lost at you. And you wonder why it's on your computer screen. They said that.
[2:27:59.980 --> 2:28:05.340]  Then Comcast executive was at a big event and talked to a pretty large industry publication,
[2:28:05.900 --> 2:28:11.420]  NewTV.com. There were other witnesses too. And then Comcast came out today and said,
[2:28:12.140 --> 2:28:15.980]  well, that's not a, that's, you know, this is not true. We're not going to have a camera that
[2:28:15.980 --> 2:28:22.300]  watches you. But then they went on and said, well, we don't call it a camera because it's
[2:28:22.300 --> 2:28:28.140]  digital. Now that's the same spin they use. They go, we don't thumb scan you and have your prints
[2:28:28.140 --> 2:28:33.020]  when you go to the grocery store or the tanning salon or the, or to the library. It's, it's a
[2:28:33.020 --> 2:28:38.300]  bunch of numbers, but so is a digital photo. They reconfigure them into that. So, so see,
[2:28:39.260 --> 2:28:44.140]  they use lawyer speak. Oh, we don't take your thumb print. We take some numbers. Oh, we don't
[2:28:44.140 --> 2:28:50.540]  take your DNA. We translated into numbers. It comes back out to your DNA. Oh, and he says that we
[2:28:50.540 --> 2:28:56.540]  don't. Well, it is a thing that does see images in the room shapes.
[2:28:56.540 --> 2:29:04.540]  And, but it's not a camera. Okay, I'm going to try the next time a cop walks up and says, turn
[2:29:04.540 --> 2:29:09.340]  your camera. I'm going to go, it's not a camera. Not a, not a can. Try what they do on us. They'll
[2:29:09.340 --> 2:29:13.180]  probably just stand down and go, yes, sir. Yeah, because it's, it's their all pre-programmed.
[2:29:14.060 --> 2:29:19.660]  Companies try to cover up, move to watch consumers of via TVs will cover this, the economy, your

[2:32:48.540 --> 2:32:55.340]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones only on the GCN radio network.
[2:32:55.340 --> 2:33:10.060]  That's right. All over the country, police go to your door just randomly and say,
[2:33:10.060 --> 2:33:14.060]  we want to search for guns. You don't have a problem, do you? And if it's in areas where they
[2:33:14.060 --> 2:33:17.100]  haven't banned guns, they just say, we want to make sure they're properly stood. Let us in. What
[2:33:17.100 --> 2:33:22.540]  do you have to hide? Most people just, oh, yes. And they just search. Just total martial law. That
[2:33:22.540 --> 2:33:30.140]  is martial law, by the way. This all creeping evil taking over. And we've got companies trying to
[2:33:30.140 --> 2:33:34.540]  sell that everyone will have to wear shock bracelets when we're on planes, the entire plane, in case
[2:33:34.540 --> 2:33:40.620]  Al Qaeda attacks, they can zap us, zap everyone to make sure that we're all safe. This is the new
[2:33:40.620 --> 2:33:46.700]  America. Cable boxes watching you, cameras built in your computers already watching you. And then
[2:33:46.700 --> 2:33:51.580]  this is what the executive at Comcast says. Comcast is denied. Listen to this. Companies try to cover
[2:33:51.580 --> 2:33:59.340]  up move to watch consumers via TVs. Vice President Conkel forgets, he told journalists, of move to
[2:33:59.340 --> 2:34:05.020]  know who was in the living room. Microsoft and Tevo have already filed similar patents to create
[2:34:05.020 --> 2:34:11.660]  minority report style invasive hell and we have links to their own press releases. Comcast has
[2:34:11.660 --> 2:34:15.980]  denied that his developing camera devices built into cable boxes that already got microphones,
[2:34:15.980 --> 2:34:21.500]  that monitor consumers as they enter the room, despite the fact that Vice President Gerard
[2:34:21.500 --> 2:34:26.700]  Conkel admitted to a journalist that such a move would present a holy grail and rival companies
[2:34:26.700 --> 2:34:33.500]  like Tevo and Microsoft have already filed patents for similar technology. And it goes on,
[2:34:33.500 --> 2:34:38.620]  a firestorm of controversy erupted last week after the industry website, newtv.com, carried an
[2:34:38.620 --> 2:34:44.540]  article by Chris Albrecht, who revealed that Comcast was experimenting with different camera
[2:34:44.540 --> 2:34:51.180]  technologies built into devices so it can know who is in your living room. How did Albrecht know
[2:34:51.180 --> 2:34:56.940]  because Comcast's senior VP of user experience, Gerard Conkel, told him about the digital living
[2:34:56.940 --> 2:35:01.420]  room conference held in San Francisco. Perhaps I've seen enemy of the state too many times,
[2:35:01.420 --> 2:35:06.860]  he said, and it went on. Trey just graduated. So did Amanda, who works here in the office at
[2:35:06.860 --> 2:35:13.020]  local colleges. They were both taught in RTF that this is the new advertising. This is already
[2:35:13.020 --> 2:35:18.460]  going on. The cable box already tracks what you watch and what you do. It's two-way.
[2:35:18.460 --> 2:35:24.860]  Your habits. That's why Tevo wants a phone line hooked to it. And if you don't have it,
[2:35:25.500 --> 2:35:27.740]  only you get any more movies. They'll turn it off and they'll say,
[2:35:27.740 --> 2:35:33.100]  you haven't connected to the telephone. They treat you like animals. You're being herded.
[2:35:33.100 --> 2:35:38.060]  You're being controlled. They just implemented into the new technological next level. It's
[2:35:38.060 --> 2:35:50.700]  like a download of data to the next level of the grid. So trying to find the quote here in their
[2:35:50.700 --> 2:36:00.620]  press release. It says, the idea being that if you turn on your cable box, it recognizes you and
[2:36:00.620 --> 2:36:04.620]  pulls up shows already in your profile or makes recommendations. If parents are watching TV with
[2:36:04.620 --> 2:36:08.700]  their children, for example, parental controls would appear to block certain content from appearing
[2:36:08.700 --> 2:36:12.220]  on the screen. Kunkel also said this type of monitoring is the holy grail because it could
[2:36:12.220 --> 2:36:17.260]  help serve up specifically tailored ads. Well, yeah, that's what Google has said they're doing.
[2:36:17.260 --> 2:36:21.580]  They don't deny it. Readers responded to the article in droves and most were shocked by the
[2:36:21.580 --> 2:36:28.060]  proposals. Orwell thought cameras in the living room were imposed on us by a fascist government.
[2:36:28.060 --> 2:36:32.860]  Fascism these days is dominated by corporate power guys under the mantle of legitimacy.
[2:36:32.860 --> 2:36:38.300]  These systems of control have been primarily put in place by willful consumption of consumer
[2:36:38.300 --> 2:36:42.460]  goods wrote one. That's right. This is not cool. This is not fun. This is not exciting. This is
[2:36:42.460 --> 2:36:47.740]  invasive. They're just talking about this technology since the inception of cable modems
[2:36:47.740 --> 2:36:51.900]  and there's certain amount of tracking in place already cameras too much shaded another
[2:36:53.420 --> 2:36:58.940]  says Comcast responded to the article by claiming the device was in no way designed to or capable
[2:36:58.940 --> 2:37:04.060]  of monitoring your living room. These technologies are designed to allow simple navigation on the
[2:37:04.060 --> 2:37:13.260]  television set just as why remote uses a camera to manage its much heralded gesture based interactivity.
[2:37:13.260 --> 2:37:19.820]  So you gesture at a device that sees your image and takes your your bodily motor orders.
[2:37:21.900 --> 2:37:28.780]  But it isn't a camera. However, Albrecht shot back by pointing out that Kunkel told him the device
[2:37:28.780 --> 2:37:33.580]  was explicitly being designed as to monitor who was entering living room. So now we have a debate
[2:37:33.580 --> 2:37:39.180]  about what a camera is and what it is. Google says they're watching you with the camera in your
[2:37:39.180 --> 2:37:44.700]  computer. But they say don't worry. It's not a human. It's a computer looking at your facial
[2:37:44.700 --> 2:37:48.860]  expressions and it has algorithms. The same ones they say they're in airports the side of your
[2:37:48.860 --> 2:37:53.740]  angry. You got a frown so they come over and talk to you and it's all quackery. It's just guilty
[2:37:53.740 --> 2:37:59.500]  until proven innocent excuses to get in your business and send you to the electric chair.
[2:38:01.980 --> 2:38:05.740]  So there's no debating at this technologies taught in school. It's been announced by
[2:38:05.740 --> 2:38:12.460]  Microsoft Yahoo Google years ago and it's in place now.
[2:38:14.780 --> 2:38:19.740]  So they just don't like the slaves hearing about it or getting scared. So they try to spin it. But
[2:38:19.740 --> 2:38:25.500]  it's the same spin of they don't say they say well the device sees your gestures and orders but
[2:38:25.500 --> 2:38:32.460]  what's wrong with that and it is two-way on the cable. So it's a two-way camera. Period. End of
[2:38:32.460 --> 2:38:40.460]  story. End of debate. End of discussion. Okay. I want to go to some of your calls. David, Tony,
[2:38:40.460 --> 2:38:44.780]  Derek, Mike, Mike and others that are patiently holding. We're going to try to jam you in here
[2:38:44.780 --> 2:38:52.140]  in the 22 minutes that we have left. But I wanted to get into economic news and I haven't talked
[2:38:52.140 --> 2:38:57.660]  about this the last week really. Dr. Roberts talked about it with me off air but I never got to it
[2:38:57.660 --> 2:39:03.100]  on air either. He said last week they were deliberately selling their positions on gold early.
[2:39:06.060 --> 2:39:11.500]  A lot of that was because companies had already bought gold when it was less expensive. They'd
[2:39:11.500 --> 2:39:15.580]  already bought futures on what was going to be mine and it was going to bankrupt them. So the IMF
[2:39:15.580 --> 2:39:20.300]  publicly dumped tens of billions of dollars last week on the gold market. They dumped gold
[2:39:20.300 --> 2:39:25.660]  at way below. They just said, you know, we don't want to sell this to you at a thousand dollars
[2:39:25.660 --> 2:39:31.900]  an ounce. We're going to sell it under and they've been sued and it's come out. They do this on
[2:39:31.900 --> 2:39:38.140]  purpose but it knocked it down for a week. Went down to about 900. Now it's at 935. It's been
[2:39:38.140 --> 2:39:42.780]  stabilized for about a day and a half at that level and then now the dollar started plunging
[2:39:42.780 --> 2:39:47.980]  again today. The dollar being devalued is only going to intensify because of them printing money,
[2:39:47.980 --> 2:39:56.380]  liquidity. We've gone over the fundamentals and remember gold went from 300 to 400. They knocked
[2:39:56.380 --> 2:40:00.620]  it back down to 300. It went up to 500. They knocked it back down to 400. It went up to 600.
[2:40:00.620 --> 2:40:04.380]  They knocked it back down to 500. They went up to 800. They knocked it down to 600. It went up to
[2:40:04.380 --> 2:40:09.820]  900. They knocked it down to 700. It went up to 900. It went down to 800. It went up to 1,000
[2:40:09.820 --> 2:40:15.020]  and they knocked it down to 950. Then it went up to 1,030. They knocked it down to 910. Now it's
[2:40:15.020 --> 2:40:22.860]  back up to 935. The question is, when to get involved in the market? A lot of you wait, you
[2:40:22.860 --> 2:40:26.860]  wait, you wait. I've seen you buy when it's up and last week I bought a few coins and some silver
[2:40:26.860 --> 2:40:32.220]  when it was up. Do I feel bad that I, oh, it lost 7% of what I bought it at in a week? No,
[2:40:32.220 --> 2:40:38.540]  because it's going to go back up and my dollar has been devalued to at least I'm taking charge,
[2:40:39.500 --> 2:40:42.140]  you see, for my family's future.
[2:40:44.700 --> 2:40:49.660]  And here it is. Dollar falls on speculation. U.S. consumer confidence is waning. Dollar is
[2:40:49.660 --> 2:40:53.740]  weakening. The dollar fell the most against the euro in two weeks. On speculation, industry reports
[2:40:53.740 --> 2:40:57.900]  will show U.S. consumer confidence dropped to a five-year low and housing slump deepened. Yeah,
[2:40:57.900 --> 2:41:04.060]  and they're trying to spin it that, wow, a 2.4 housing sale increase, but the biggest one-month
[2:41:04.060 --> 2:41:10.540]  loss in prices. Prices are plunging now for a year, continuing to plunge. Some people did some
[2:41:10.540 --> 2:41:18.060]  bargain hunting and they try to spin that. I'm not trying to be negative here. I'm just saying
[2:41:18.060 --> 2:41:22.540]  gold's going to go back above 1,000. Almost all the industry experts say that it's going to go
[2:41:22.540 --> 2:41:28.140]  above the 1980 high, which is $2,200 and adjusted for inflation. I don't know if that's going to happen.
[2:41:28.140 --> 2:41:31.980]  I just know I got gold that can't be devalued down to nothing and I got some silver that
[2:41:31.980 --> 2:41:36.140]  can't be devalued out of nothing. And it's enough to at least live a while and, you know, whatever.
[2:41:37.180 --> 2:41:44.700]  And so that's the bottom line here and gold is at 935 today, but Ted locked it in the last few
[2:41:44.700 --> 2:41:51.900]  days when it was back at 910. So he has got great deals for you. And I suggest, you know,
[2:41:51.900 --> 2:41:57.500]  I said buy gold when it was 264. I said buy silver when it was $5. You know, now it's up by 20.
[2:41:58.540 --> 2:42:06.780]  I said buy gold when it's 500, 600, 700, 800, 900. And Ted, you've been in this market 20 plus years
[2:42:08.140 --> 2:42:12.700]  and we knew about a week ago, two weeks ago, that they were going to do this. We saw them
[2:42:12.700 --> 2:42:22.300]  positioning, coming into the market, trying to put puts on it. We saw them belly up to do that.
[2:42:22.300 --> 2:42:27.660]  We saw them selling their futures at reduced prices. We saw all sorts of things going on.
[2:42:27.660 --> 2:42:32.220]  Can you describe what they did, Ted? Yeah, absolutely. What happened in that particular
[2:42:32.220 --> 2:42:37.660]  moment, we had gold hit, well, like you said, about 1,030 and it was backing down. It was about
[2:42:37.660 --> 2:42:42.380]  1,010 and that was due to the fact that the central banks were selling positions.
[2:42:42.380 --> 2:42:46.860]  When you start buying short or when you're selling short in the futures market, you're not
[2:42:46.860 --> 2:42:52.140]  actually putting puts on it. That's the options, but this is actually the futures market.
[2:42:52.140 --> 2:42:55.820]  Well, they were doing both of them. Yeah, they were. They were buying puts and they're selling
[2:42:55.820 --> 2:43:00.220]  short the gold. But what happened is that the people that had the long positions after a
[2:43:00.220 --> 2:43:05.340]  certain point, when you enter a long position in gold and you put a stop limit so you can limit
[2:43:05.340 --> 2:43:10.860]  the amount of money that you lose if the things go in the wrong direction, it automatically forces
[2:43:10.860 --> 2:43:17.180]  you to be a seller rather than being a buyer. Let's explain. People lock these in a month,
[2:43:17.180 --> 2:43:22.460]  two months in. They only have certain windows where they can make decisions. They had all,
[2:43:22.460 --> 2:43:27.980]  because you better do this because you can lose everything you got. Tens of billions of dollars
[2:43:27.980 --> 2:43:33.100]  globally or more than that was pre-programmed in that if it went above a certain amount,
[2:43:33.100 --> 2:43:37.420]  they had to dump so they didn't lose everything and that's why Kitco and others last week said
[2:43:37.420 --> 2:43:42.060]  it was going to drop and it did. Yeah, it did and it dropped because those stop limits were
[2:43:42.060 --> 2:43:47.180]  crossed. It forced the market to turn into a net seller than a net buyer and a lot of that was
[2:43:47.180 --> 2:43:52.700]  institutional money. A lot of it was the Federal Reserve system and the IMF and all these different
[2:43:52.700 --> 2:43:57.580]  Well, they waited to hammer gold until that came into play. They wait till everything hits it at
[2:43:57.580 --> 2:44:01.980]  once. Yeah, exactly. They have to sell and they have to sell hard. So then once that happens,
[2:44:01.980 --> 2:44:06.380]  which do then as you start looking for a support level, they call it and that's where
[2:44:06.380 --> 2:44:12.380]  the market just simply, there's not, you know, all the selling contracts get washed out and then
[2:44:12.380 --> 2:44:18.140]  so that momentum gets, that dies off and then you start to reach. Also, jewelry makers had canceled
[2:44:18.140 --> 2:44:23.180]  most of their gold purchases because it had gotten so expensive, but then demand went back up.
[2:44:23.180 --> 2:44:29.420]  When they saw it drop down to 910, they greedily ran in Asia, Europe and the U.S. and bought in
[2:44:29.420 --> 2:44:34.700]  mass, that's driving it back up. It has dropped. Yeah, because jewelry purchase is about 42 percent
[2:44:34.700 --> 2:44:40.620]  of global gold sales. It was about 65. That's now reversed with institutional gold buyers.
[2:44:40.620 --> 2:44:45.500]  And even a lot of smart money came to us. I mean, there's a lot of people that took advantage of
[2:44:45.500 --> 2:44:51.260]  that lower price as did I. I was back in the marketplace looking at that 910 and thinking,
[2:44:51.260 --> 2:44:54.860]  you know, I can do some real good things. Well, you know what? I bought it to high and I don't
[2:44:54.860 --> 2:44:59.020]  feel bad because I also bought it to low. Well, the thing about it is, Alex, none of us have a
[2:44:59.020 --> 2:45:04.620]  crystal ball. No one of us is going to be able to tell that this one sale that the IMF pushes
[2:45:04.620 --> 2:45:08.540]  out there in the marketplace is actually going to tip the prices lower because they did four to
[2:45:08.540 --> 2:45:12.700]  five in the month before they did nothing. Yeah, exactly. So it just depends upon where the market
[2:45:12.700 --> 2:45:16.060]  and where the mood is. And they've been trying to push it down so people get back into these
[2:45:16.060 --> 2:45:20.460]  ridiculous fiat paper currencies that they're, you know, not just the United States dollar,
[2:45:20.460 --> 2:45:25.020]  but all the other dollar, all the other currencies of the world as well. But people were moving
[2:45:25.020 --> 2:45:28.780]  away from all that stuff because the entire markets are melting down everywhere. Well,
[2:45:28.780 --> 2:45:33.340]  I don't know why even I usually buy when it's going up, you know, whether it was from 260 to
[2:45:33.340 --> 2:45:37.900]  300 I'd go and buy. People have the instinct to buy when it's going up because they feel like it's
[2:45:37.900 --> 2:45:43.980]  a sure thing. Now is the time to get in because there is no doubt with the market fundamentals,
[2:45:43.980 --> 2:45:52.220]  the dollar is going down, the spending is just on fire, the 200 billion a month on average being
[2:45:52.220 --> 2:45:59.100]  pumped into the big bankers systems by the taxpayer. There is no doubt the dollars tanking.
[2:45:59.100 --> 2:46:03.260]  I don't know where gold will be, but I know it's not going to be devalued. And so Ted, tell
[2:46:03.260 --> 2:46:06.780]  me about the special. Yeah, here's what we have right now, Alex. And I did pick these up here
[2:46:06.780 --> 2:46:12.140]  just a few days ago. We do have the British sovereign right now. They're a 256 same coin
[2:46:12.140 --> 2:46:18.380]  that was at 289 here just a week and a half ago. We also have the French Frank coin, which we've
[2:46:18.380 --> 2:46:23.420]  been talking about that coin is a fabulous buy. And right now it's 204. And that's the same coin
[2:46:23.420 --> 2:46:28.620]  that was approaching 230 here just a week ago. Here's a deal. I tell you, right now,
[2:46:28.620 --> 2:46:33.900]  the US Mint can't even make 1988 Silver Eagles anymore because that's right. There's massive
[2:46:33.900 --> 2:46:37.820]  silver shortages. Yeah, they don't have the supply to make them. Plus also, I was talking
[2:46:37.820 --> 2:46:42.700]  about 12 major dealers are sold out. I was, I was using, I was picking on those walking
[2:46:42.700 --> 2:46:47.100]  Liberty haves here just within about a week ago. We're sold out of those silver dollars.
[2:46:47.100 --> 2:46:50.940]  That's what I bought last week. Silver dollars in circulated condition to Alex,
[2:46:50.940 --> 2:46:55.900]  sold out, gone. They're just about anything. I can't even get bars of silver. It's crazy,
[2:46:55.900 --> 2:47:02.380]  but I do have a stash. I picked up a whole bunch of BU or MS 60 grades, Silver dollars that are
[2:47:02.380 --> 2:47:09.820]  almost at the circulated price. Right now we, they're about $32 a piece. It's $665 per.
[2:47:09.820 --> 2:47:14.860]  Let's explain that's a collector coin, but you're getting into it at a very low price. Yeah,
[2:47:14.860 --> 2:47:19.900]  you're getting it close to melt. If you, if you go take a look around, if a silver dealer has
[2:47:19.900 --> 2:47:24.780]  some silver dollars available, they're pricing them at about 26 to $27 a piece.
[2:47:24.780 --> 2:47:28.780]  And that's, that's for junk. This is collector. Yeah, this is brand new. They've never been
[2:47:28.780 --> 2:47:33.660]  used and obviously just as short of supply. As a matter of fact, Alex, after this interview,
[2:47:33.660 --> 2:47:37.420]  we probably won't be able to sell these again either. And by the way, folks, we're not just
[2:47:37.420 --> 2:47:44.060]  saying that the silver dollars are gone. The half dollars are gone. Ted, again, tell folks
[2:47:44.060 --> 2:47:47.180]  what you've got in the gold department. Yeah. And the gold department really seriously,
[2:47:47.180 --> 2:47:51.820]  the British sovereign coin is a great buy at 256. It's a quarter ounce gold coin. You can't
[2:47:51.820 --> 2:47:57.820]  beat it. And that French Frank, again, that is a great coin to be getting into. It's 204.
[2:47:57.820 --> 2:48:02.140]  Small pieces of gold are going to belly out when the economy is really tough. And it already is
[2:48:02.140 --> 2:48:06.140]  tough for watching the housing prices drop. Yeah, because small pieces of gold for thousands of
[2:48:06.140 --> 2:48:13.260]  years and still today always sell more than larger coins. So if you have 10, 10th of an ounce
[2:48:13.260 --> 2:48:19.500]  eagles, that goes for a lot more anywhere than one one ounce eagle, you know, of the same year
[2:48:19.500 --> 2:48:24.140]  or same collector value because this is near bullion. But you get some collector value because
[2:48:24.140 --> 2:48:30.220]  people always want smaller coins because they're easier to get rid of. They're easier in transactions.
[2:48:30.220 --> 2:48:34.700]  They're easier to cash out. You may go when the economy is falling apart with a sale, you know,
[2:48:34.700 --> 2:48:39.900]  with a full ounce of gold in one coin. And they may not be able to buy that off you, but they may
[2:48:39.900 --> 2:48:45.820]  be able to take some of the 10th of the answers off of you. Bottom line, you need to get involved
[2:48:45.820 --> 2:48:54.700]  now. Give them the number, Ted. Yeah, call us at 1-800-686-2237. Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[2:48:54.700 --> 2:49:01.260]  Alex, gold or silver has got up $2 an ounce since it reached its last bottom. And those silver
[2:49:01.260 --> 2:49:07.340]  dollars again are going to be sold out. That is a fabulous buy. And now that gold and silver are
[2:49:07.340 --> 2:49:12.140]  having shortages and driving up the price, but silver is actually disappearing. Just Google
[2:49:12.140 --> 2:49:17.100]  silver shortages. They're not going to be able to artificially suppress it once the word gets out.
[2:49:17.100 --> 2:49:21.820]  No, they're not. As a matter of fact, even the physical and the futures market and silver
[2:49:21.820 --> 2:49:26.140]  just cannot be manipulated like gold. This last time... It's got a lot lower reserves.
[2:49:26.140 --> 2:49:31.340]  Yeah, that's exactly right. Silver mines had shut down because when silver was down there at 3 bucks
[2:49:31.340 --> 2:49:35.900]  an ounce and it cost 10 to bring it out of the ground, 10 to 15. And that's when oil prices
[2:49:35.900 --> 2:49:40.780]  were down at about a buck and a half per gallon. I mean, can imagine what it cost to move. Yeah,
[2:49:40.780 --> 2:49:46.780]  we're only going to have more inflation. 1-800-686-2237. All the New World Order people
[2:49:46.780 --> 2:49:52.140]  tell you, don't get into gold and silver. They tell you, go with them. They love you.
[2:49:52.140 --> 2:49:59.260]  That's pure baloney. 1-800-686-2237. Protect yourself. Hurt the New World Order. You just can't
[2:49:59.260 --> 2:50:05.580]  beat it. 800-686-2237. And Ted, thank you for coming on with us. Yeah, thanks for having me up
[2:50:05.580 --> 2:50:09.740]  again, Alex. You bet. Yeah, I don't even really plug the sponsors. I don't even plug my own films
[2:50:09.740 --> 2:50:13.740]  anymore, but I have been plugging gold because in silver because it's just such a good deal.
[2:50:14.620 --> 2:50:20.140]  And do I feel bad buying silver at $21 an ounce? Do I feel bad buying gold at $1,000 an ounce? No.
[2:50:20.940 --> 2:50:25.020]  No, I don't. Because at least it's something they can't devalue and it's only going back up.
[2:50:25.660 --> 2:50:29.900]  Unfortunately, I wish that they would do things that would save the dollar because it's all
[2:50:29.900 --> 2:50:34.860]  we've got, but they're not going to. And so I might as well have some type of parachute.
[2:50:34.860 --> 2:50:39.100]  All right, final segment loaded phone lines. I'm going to give each caller one minute on the other
[2:50:39.100 --> 2:50:43.420]  side. Stand by. I want to hear what you have to say. Don't forget the website, prisonplanet.tv.
[2:50:48.060 --> 2:50:56.060]  It is a big idea. A New World Order. In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful
[2:50:56.060 --> 2:51:02.300]  world government. It's known as the Builder Bird. Could their objective be world domination?
[2:51:02.300 --> 2:51:08.940]  Or thousands of years their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order,
[2:51:08.940 --> 2:51:13.420]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[2:51:16.380 --> 2:51:21.820]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[2:51:21.820 --> 2:51:25.660]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[2:51:25.660 --> 2:51:28.300]  Builder Bird is making great progress for the world government.
[2:51:28.300 --> 2:51:31.500]  Most people have no idea they're not after money. They have all the money they need.
[2:51:31.500 --> 2:51:33.580]  They're after power. That's their after easy.

[2:51:47.100 --> 2:51:52.300]  It's a fact. Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States
[2:51:52.300 --> 2:51:56.860]  create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue, with never ending late fees
[2:51:56.860 --> 2:52:01.340]  over the limit fees and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible
[2:52:01.340 --> 2:52:06.460]  to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors. The Federal Debt Relief System has
[2:52:06.460 --> 2:52:11.660]  created a successful attorney backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans,
[2:52:11.660 --> 2:52:15.580]  lines of credit and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[2:52:15.580 --> 2:52:19.820]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment,
[2:52:19.820 --> 2:52:23.740]  ending with nothing on your credit report. Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe
[2:52:23.740 --> 2:52:27.900]  with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt. Instead of living each
[2:52:27.900 --> 2:52:31.660]  day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[2:52:31.660 --> 2:52:40.860]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600. That's 877-943-8600 or visit FDRS.org.

[2:53:54.620 --> 2:53:58.220]  Okay, let's go to David in British Columbia. I've been holding patiently. Welcome, David.
[2:53:59.740 --> 2:54:06.700]  Hello. Yes, sir. Yeah, Alex. I'm phoning from Nelson, which is I believe you've been on our
[2:54:06.700 --> 2:54:12.700]  community radio station being interviewed. I remember that, yes. Yeah. Anyways, we're also
[2:54:12.700 --> 2:54:22.220]  known as a resistor bill according to 60 minutes because of we have the probably highest concentration
[2:54:22.220 --> 2:54:31.260]  of draft dodgers from the Vietnam era and plus new Iraqi soldiers or our soldiers from Iraq,
[2:54:31.260 --> 2:54:41.500]  rather. And recently, we had a big meeting on the SPP. I was actually very surprised. I've
[2:54:41.500 --> 2:54:46.220]  been following this issue for many years and a lot of the issues that you cover on your show.
[2:54:46.940 --> 2:54:51.740]  And I went to the meeting, you know, expecting maybe, you know, 50 people, but it turned out
[2:54:51.740 --> 2:54:56.780]  to be about 500 people. It was so large that there was a standing room out in the hall
[2:54:56.780 --> 2:55:05.180]  and people of all ages from, you know, babies up to, you know, people in their 80s. And the panel
[2:55:05.180 --> 2:55:14.780]  consisted of two MPs that have been most vocal and active on this issue and also people from
[2:55:14.780 --> 2:55:22.300]  peace groups and food security groups and so on. And it was a huge success. And I just want to
[2:55:22.300 --> 2:55:27.820]  encourage people to get out there and write your politicians and whoever and your letters
[2:55:27.820 --> 2:55:35.020]  to the editor because I feel this was a major reason why this meeting occurred because there
[2:55:35.020 --> 2:55:40.620]  was a lot of grassroots people pressuring and writing about it. Well, good job. Good job,
[2:55:40.620 --> 2:55:45.740]  brother. Call me back and tell me more about it. We just got to jump. Tony in North Carolina, go
[2:55:45.740 --> 2:55:53.260]  ahead. Hello. Yes, sir. How are you doing? Good. Fine. Calling from the increasingly clamping down
[2:55:53.260 --> 2:56:00.380]  state of North Carolina. Yes. On our Tar Heels here. I just wanted to address an issue. By the
[2:56:00.380 --> 2:56:04.140]  way, Alex, you'll love this. I live right across the street from a G temple. I can bullhorn it on
[2:56:04.140 --> 2:56:10.300]  my way to the mailbox. Oh, okay. I don't like listening to Vice President referring to everything
[2:56:10.300 --> 2:56:16.060]  in months. That makes me very nervous. If we've had 52 months of fun, does that mean there's only
[2:56:16.060 --> 2:56:20.380]  52 months of what left? I don't even want to go to that year. I've already published some stuff on
[2:56:20.380 --> 2:56:26.700]  Jason Martel's groups and we all have theories about that. But there was a young man here in my
[2:56:26.700 --> 2:56:32.860]  area, 19 years old. His name was Strickland. He was murdered through the door because he was accused
[2:56:32.860 --> 2:56:37.420]  of stealing a PlayStation. There was no gun there. The only gun they found there was the gun that
[2:56:37.420 --> 2:56:43.340]  probably came with the PlayStation. So I'm wondering if I go try to ask my local police
[2:56:43.340 --> 2:56:46.540]  department about their microwave gun. Am I going to be classified as a terrorist?
[2:56:47.580 --> 2:56:50.940]  Well, that's the new system, just indiscriminate killing of the citizenry.
[2:56:52.460 --> 2:56:56.700]  Hmm. So you really, you can't even inquire about all that?
[2:56:58.060 --> 2:57:01.900]  Well, no, you can inquire about it and you should. You should find out if your city council's got one
[2:57:01.900 --> 2:57:08.060]  or two. Usually at the National Guard, I'm reweighting as part of John Warner Defense Authorization
[2:57:08.060 --> 2:57:13.020]  Act to back up the police. Call me back again. We'll talk more about it. I hate cutting everybody
[2:57:13.020 --> 2:57:17.500]  short. I just end up babbling and don't have time. Derek in Michigan, you're on the air.
[2:57:18.060 --> 2:57:24.700]  Hey, how you doing, Alex? Good. Pleasure to talk to you. I'm calling in regards to the Brookings
[2:57:24.700 --> 2:57:30.300]  Institute paper about the region of the Great Lakes. It states, you know,
[2:57:30.300 --> 2:57:34.060]  yeah, they said that they want to make it a north, the first part of the North American Union.
[2:57:34.060 --> 2:57:40.540]  Yeah, I didn't get to it today. It talks about that the U.S. and Canada should have a mutually
[2:57:40.540 --> 2:57:45.900]  recognized credentials and identification to allow the secure unhindered movement of people
[2:57:45.900 --> 2:57:53.340]  across the border as well as transported goods. And you know, I am my license or my wallet stolen.
[2:57:53.340 --> 2:57:57.580]  And believe it or not, because Michigan's part of the real idea, which is a shame,
[2:57:57.580 --> 2:58:03.660]  you know, I need like 15 pieces of ID. I go to the county building to get my divorce record.
[2:58:03.660 --> 2:58:07.340]  But the illegal aliens call again, call me back. I can't get to everybody else. We're just out of
[2:58:07.340 --> 2:58:12.780]  time. And I forgot there was some guy who wanted to talk about the evil agenda of the, his local
[2:58:12.780 --> 2:58:18.780]  diocese. And I just forgot he was holding call me back tomorrow, sir. You can go to the head of
[2:58:18.780 --> 2:58:22.540]  the line. And if you reasonably want to call in and talk about anything, you're welcome to do it.
