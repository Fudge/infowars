[00:00.000 --> 00:18.520]  here we are defining the reality of our world we're in the midst of a global
[00:18.520 --> 00:26.920]  corporate authoritarian consolidation takeover design collapse and only
[00:26.920 --> 00:33.040]  exposing it will defeat it I went to the dentist this morning to get fitted
[00:33.040 --> 00:38.360]  for one of my implants I'm grinding my teeth off to bloody nubs and I talked to
[00:38.360 --> 00:42.080]  an old couple talked to a young couple talked to the two dental hygienists and
[00:42.080 --> 00:46.840]  talked to the doctor and they all knew that COVID is a scam and that they're
[00:46.840 --> 00:51.560]  using the deaths from other things in the COVID column and they all knew about
[00:51.560 --> 00:58.880]  basically the great reset and they should know what to do about it so so so
[00:58.880 --> 01:03.160]  there is a level of understanding but this is criminal what's happening and
[01:03.160 --> 01:06.640]  this is all the great reset this is all the UN world government takeover this is
[01:06.640 --> 01:11.080]  21st century war and these are the guys that say we can't have national borders
[01:11.080 --> 01:15.680]  and that we got to take migrants quote into our homes and we got to let drag
[01:15.680 --> 01:18.920]  Queen's story time out with our kids but but that we've all got to have COVID
[01:18.920 --> 01:22.800]  passports to travel even inside the country and now to even start your car
[01:22.800 --> 01:26.320]  that's where all this is going it's all being announced it's insane
[01:26.320 --> 01:31.840]  we're not at all out today but I was sure you're the host the war room does a
[01:31.840 --> 01:35.920]  great job weekdays 3 to 6 p.m. and they comes back with Sunday live after my
[01:35.920 --> 01:40.160]  Sunday show six to eight he does two hours after I go live four to six and
[01:40.160 --> 01:45.520]  so and he had a pretty good rant nailing it on what's happening with the wall
[01:45.520 --> 01:49.480]  going up around the Capitol so here is that report will come back start your
[01:49.480 --> 01:54.360]  interest the main transmission this is a big broadcast today very very important
[01:54.360 --> 01:59.680]  120 hours left till the Communist Chinese agent is installed folks they're now
[01:59.680 --> 02:04.480]  building barriers around the Capitol building around the grounds so that you
[02:04.480 --> 02:10.320]  can't even get within 500 yards of the Capitol so the traders the biggest
[02:10.320 --> 02:14.760]  criminals in the in the United States work in Congress the biggest criminals
[02:14.760 --> 02:18.960]  that stole our election are in Congress and so it's so typical this is what
[02:18.960 --> 02:22.600]  happens in third-world dictatorships this is what happens in authoritarian
[02:22.600 --> 02:28.640]  regimes they strong they they they build up barriers to protect themselves from
[02:28.640 --> 02:34.000]  the people because they're criminals yeah the people hate the government you
[02:34.000 --> 02:39.880]  suck you have sold us out you have robbed us dry you have taxed us without
[02:39.880 --> 02:44.040]  representation you've given our money to foreign countries you've stolen our
[02:44.040 --> 02:50.120]  elections you've shut down our businesses you have destroyed us and we know it we
[02:50.120 --> 02:54.320]  know who the criminals are they live in DC they serve in the halls of Congress
[02:54.320 --> 02:59.880]  and we're so pissed and we know it so now you're building huge infrastructure
[02:59.880 --> 03:04.840]  huge big walls to protect your criminal behavior from us and it's
[03:04.840 --> 03:11.800]  disgusting but it's not gonna stop the truth from coming out and it's not gonna
[03:11.800 --> 03:16.040]  stop the people from being informed and angry but see now they're going after
[03:16.040 --> 03:19.920]  the information control system of social media and they're just banning
[03:19.920 --> 03:24.520]  everybody they tested it with info wars we told you they do everybody else the
[03:24.520 --> 03:28.320]  president didn't listen his administration told him not to listen to us now
[03:28.320 --> 03:32.080]  it's here so how are you gonna have the revolution when you can't communicate
[03:32.080 --> 03:36.640]  and they say they're gonna take the parlor app off of smartphones here we go
[03:36.640 --> 03:43.920]  ladies and gentlemen and this is what makes me so sad that they've pit us
[03:43.920 --> 03:50.440]  against the police and they've pit us against one another when the real enemies
[03:50.440 --> 03:55.960]  are the ones betraying us in the halls of Congress the real enemies are the ones
[03:55.960 --> 04:01.600]  lying to us consciously in the media every night and they all know it and we
[04:01.600 --> 04:06.880]  all know it but see they still have control of the infrastructure to protect
[04:06.880 --> 04:11.640]  themselves they still own the judges they still own the police commissioners
[04:11.640 --> 04:15.800]  they still own it all so they still have their fingers and feet on the levers of
[04:15.800 --> 04:23.920]  power until we wake up until we unite until we take action and I can feel it
[04:23.920 --> 04:26.980]  it's not gonna be pretty it's not gonna be perfect it's gonna be rough and
[04:26.980 --> 04:32.480]  tumble we're gonna make mistakes but this is the American way this is all
[04:32.480 --> 04:36.680]  about self-government and you know what maybe America falls maybe the flag falls
[04:36.680 --> 04:44.200]  but I tell you what human freedom self-government free market that's what
[04:44.200 --> 04:59.800]  successful that's what people want and that will be restored now is the time
[04:59.800 --> 05:04.120]  to get prepared you got to pray to God and get your soul ready you got to be
[05:04.120 --> 05:08.200]  prepared to physically defend yourself and your family and you've also got to
[05:08.200 --> 05:11.920]  get things that allow you and your family to not be dependent on the system
[05:11.920 --> 05:16.340]  that's why they want to bankrupt the economy it's why they want to destroy
[05:16.340 --> 05:20.060]  the infrastructure of this nation because they want all of us on our knees
[05:20.060 --> 05:24.820]  so they can dictate our surrender to them info wars is a critical

[06:30.420 --> 06:36.740]  all out in the open great time of revelation is taking place the enemy
[06:36.740 --> 06:43.100]  is striking while we have Jack Dorsey caught secretly by project Veritas
[06:43.100 --> 06:48.580]  communicating with he believed the top executives at Twitter about how they're
[06:48.580 --> 06:54.100]  gonna censor everybody and this is just the beginning banning Trump we've got
[06:54.100 --> 06:57.020]  the Mexican president coming out saying he's gonna lead a global movement
[06:57.020 --> 07:00.460]  Trump should have done this to stop big tech from abusing the people and
[07:00.460 --> 07:04.700]  censoring everyone and that this is a criminal combine is one of the greatest
[07:04.700 --> 07:09.220]  dangers the world's ever seen that's what Ted Cruz says to true by the way
[07:09.220 --> 07:14.740]  I mean this is classic like if tyranny was a liquor it's 200 proof folks that
[07:14.740 --> 07:20.300]  means a hundred percent liquor no no non alcohol this is pure this is rocket
[07:20.300 --> 07:28.420]  fuel and everything they're doing is just classic Godzilla level corruption I
[07:28.420 --> 07:33.180]  mean it's it's King Kong level whatever you want to call it it's colossal and
[07:33.180 --> 07:37.460]  we're just sleepwalking over the edge of a cliff and they're just making their
[07:37.460 --> 07:42.260]  move and the global inflationary bubble is completely insane and what Joe
[07:42.260 --> 07:47.060]  Biden is announcing is completely insane and I'm just sitting here not even
[07:47.060 --> 07:52.020]  hating Joe Biden not even hating Hillary Clinton I'm just thinking God every day
[07:52.020 --> 07:56.580]  that I'm not them and not involved in the incredible evil they're involved in
[07:56.580 --> 08:02.300]  because these are enslaved demonically controlled people I always try to do
[08:02.300 --> 08:05.300]  this I'm never successful at it but I just think I want to start the show by
[08:05.300 --> 08:10.860]  just reading you from the stacks because I went through all of these stacks we're
[08:10.860 --> 08:15.140]  talking probably 200 300 articles here I looked at all of these I probably read
[08:15.140 --> 08:20.940]  50 of them but I scanned over the rest and it's just all over the top here
[08:20.940 --> 08:25.180]  here let's just look at this stack first right here I mean I can spend an hour
[08:25.180 --> 08:31.180]  just on this little this little darling right here from infowars.com which
[08:31.180 --> 08:37.540]  just got links to mainstream Reuters you name it foreign news Norway TV 23 dead

[08:41.780 --> 08:45.780]  some people see they're now just normalizing the death that's just one
[08:45.780 --> 08:51.700]  article here study COVID lockdown harms are 10 times greater than benefits and
[08:51.700 --> 08:59.220]  causes more people to die from suicide drug addiction drug overdose and more
[08:59.220 --> 09:05.100]  but that's okay Microsoft Big Tech Coalition developing Rockefeller funded
[09:05.100 --> 09:09.820]  COVID passports they're already studied and deployed in communist China it's all
[09:09.820 --> 09:17.580]  admitted it's called the vaccine credential initiative but don't worry
[09:17.580 --> 09:22.580]  Biden's got the rescue America package he's gonna rescue us with ongoing
[09:22.580 --> 09:28.140]  lockdowns and teaching us to have a universal basic income you're like oh

[09:41.780 --> 09:44.740]  when you can go on vacation I mean this is all being announced this is the
[09:44.740 --> 09:54.620]  Tata technocracy I hates technocracies well there you go total tyranny New
[09:54.620 --> 09:59.580]  Jersey seizes 100% of Jim's assets for defying COVID lockdown despite
[09:59.580 --> 10:03.500]  Supreme Court rulings and Supreme Court state rulings around the country
[10:03.500 --> 10:07.900]  saying what New Jersey's done is illegal they seized 100% of the gym that
[10:07.900 --> 10:11.340]  said we're essential we're not going bankrupt even after government payments
[10:11.340 --> 10:15.700]  have ended they're saying we're not gonna give you payments to survive which is
[10:15.700 --> 10:20.540]  bad enough you're just got to shut down oh but your bills are still due that's
[10:20.540 --> 10:23.780]  putting a gun to your head
[10:23.780 --> 10:30.620]  CDC projects up to 90,000 US COVID deaths in the next three weeks oh guess how
[10:30.620 --> 10:35.580]  many people die on average about 9,000 a day guess what the worst day of the week
[10:35.580 --> 10:39.500]  for death is Saturday guess what the worst month of the year for deaths is
[10:39.500 --> 10:46.780]  up to 15,000 deaths a day it's you guessed it judge judge judge judge judge
[10:46.780 --> 10:54.620]  January look it up I did this morning we've hired it again an actuary
[10:54.620 --> 10:58.540]  mathematician we've got the numbers but I'm getting broke down more but it's
[10:58.540 --> 11:05.100]  just what we thought more deaths in 2018 and there were in 2019 actually went
[11:05.100 --> 11:09.860]  down some that year and then 61,000 more deaths in the year 2020 and if you cut
[11:09.860 --> 11:13.180]  out population increase the normal increase of deaths each year and take
[11:13.180 --> 11:16.860]  out part of the suicide increase well you have less people dying so basically
[11:16.860 --> 11:22.220]  the same amount died but the public doesn't understand statistics 370
[11:22.220 --> 11:26.780]  million people that hey 10,000 of those are coming in a day and are going out a
[11:26.780 --> 11:31.660]  day baby don't fear the Reaper they're coming in they're coming out they're
[11:31.660 --> 11:34.980]  coming in they're coming out almost everybody I know and grew up in love

[11:51.260 --> 11:54.660]  value I wear a mask all the time you show these people statistics they go I
[11:54.660 --> 11:59.020]  don't care it's mine it's my value they think it's like a billion dollars to
[11:59.020 --> 12:03.340]  wear the mask in those statistically use them back to your own ammonia meanwhile

[12:20.500 --> 12:25.420]  official Chinese government saying you have to scan a QR code to come and go

[12:46.980 --> 12:51.820]  because they don't think two three steps people are very lazy especially women
[12:51.820 --> 12:55.460]  and that statistically I'm not saying women are bad but they're very trusting
[12:55.460 --> 13:00.260]  that's why when any foreign group ever took over a culture they kill all the
[13:00.260 --> 13:05.700]  adult men because they're not gonna go along and keep the women and it's women
[13:05.700 --> 13:09.620]  on average serving the beast it's also women that are fighting it's all

[14:33.700 --> 14:38.620]  that but no they'll be less for you too when we build up scalable economies that
[14:38.620 --> 14:41.820]  care about taking care of people and they're complex and that and that are
[14:41.820 --> 14:49.060]  loving we have a Renaissance economy we have a barbarous economy where we kill
[14:49.060 --> 14:52.580]  babies and kill old people and all this we're in a nightmare economy and if you
[14:52.580 --> 14:56.820]  think a society that'll treat old people or children or the mentally
[14:56.820 --> 15:02.100]  handicapped badly well then how are you gonna be treated and Christ told the

[17:57.460 --> 18:04.340]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[18:27.460 --> 18:37.460]  there are so many people that enjoy throwing Trump under the bus there are
[18:37.460 --> 18:42.740]  so many people that now that he's had the election stolen from him and is being
[18:42.740 --> 18:48.060]  demonized and attacked and has such a hellish future ahead of him and this
[18:48.060 --> 18:53.620]  giant lynch mob of federal prosecutors and state prosecutors that are
[18:53.620 --> 18:58.140]  promising to put him in jail with all these trumped-up charges people are
[18:58.140 --> 19:02.420]  jumping ship on Trump and they're doing it a really smart way oh Trump was never
[19:02.420 --> 19:06.220]  hardcore enough Trump wasn't a purist Trump couldn't get everything done the
[19:06.220 --> 19:11.740]  way we want it Trump made mistakes when clearly he was an anti-globalist clearly
[19:11.740 --> 19:17.020]  he was the president clearly he actually tried to expand the country's success
[19:17.020 --> 19:20.660]  and wealth and tried to make better deals with China and turned our coal
[19:20.660 --> 19:24.700]  plants back on that are beautiful and do such a great job giving us cheap and
[19:24.700 --> 19:30.740]  expensive high-quality energy he signed executive orders as massively curtailing
[19:30.740 --> 19:35.900]  child trafficking sex trafficking I mean the list goes on and on and as Christ
[19:35.900 --> 19:41.420]  said when you are good you will be persecuted so you're blessed if you're
[19:41.420 --> 19:47.860]  persecuted by the world and so I support Trump more now that he doesn't have as
[19:47.860 --> 19:52.420]  much power I support Trump more now because he's being persecuted because
[19:52.420 --> 19:57.100]  that's what the spirit in me says to do that doesn't mean I don't point out the
[19:57.100 --> 20:00.900]  incredible mistakes Trump made and I've made mistakes as well but my spirit
[20:00.900 --> 20:06.940]  tells me Trump's good my spirit tells me to support Trump that's why when some
[20:06.940 --> 20:10.980]  people have said oh Joan supports Trump because of money or Joan supports Trump
[20:10.980 --> 20:16.100]  because his audience wants that that's not the case I have been persecuted I
[20:16.100 --> 20:20.300]  have been sued over 50 times I have been lied about I have been physically
[20:20.300 --> 20:25.260]  attacked because I've supported Trump hey but I listen all the people that were
[20:25.260 --> 20:28.900]  the armchair quarterback conservatives and patriots and people you're not gonna
[20:28.900 --> 20:32.420]  have Trump to kick around anymore okay you're gonna have a communist Chinese
[20:32.420 --> 20:39.100]  agent okay and so we'll see how you like that because this man needs our prayers
[20:39.100 --> 20:43.980]  he's gone through hell and and and they're coming after him and believe me
[20:43.980 --> 20:48.260]  if they can censor him and if they can put him in prison they can put you in
[20:48.260 --> 20:52.260]  prison they're gonna use him as the example of tearing a former president
[20:52.260 --> 20:57.620]  apart because he wasn't a globalist to scare any other populist leaders in the
[20:57.620 --> 21:02.500]  world to not be like Trump or Bolsonaro and they can't make Bolsonaro back off
[21:02.500 --> 21:05.940]  that guy's even tougher than Trump I'm not gonna go into it but it's he's
[21:05.940 --> 21:13.380]  fearless so they don't grow on trees like Bolsonaro and Trump and this is real
[21:13.380 --> 21:18.980]  evil we're facing and so folks need to understand that it's coming in to shut
[21:18.980 --> 21:22.460]  everything down there's a global revolution against the new world order
[21:22.460 --> 21:26.180]  globalism is a consortium of corporations that do not want free market
[21:26.180 --> 21:31.140]  they want fascist monopoly to carry out eugenics people was like what's a
[21:31.140 --> 21:35.900]  globalist I call them globalists because they call themselves globalist
[21:35.900 --> 21:39.620]  starting in the 70s of big the Brzezinski globalist believes in global
[21:39.620 --> 21:43.940]  government not international man and libertarianism and you can travel and
[21:43.940 --> 21:46.940]  live wherever you want and their standardized systems I'm all for that
[21:46.940 --> 21:49.620]  as long as it's free market and as long as people agree to it it's not
[21:49.620 --> 21:54.180]  authoritarian but the great reset and saying you're not essential in shutting
[21:54.180 --> 21:58.060]  down small businesses and coming with forced inoculations and all of this is
[21:58.060 --> 22:00.500]  authoritarian globalism
[22:00.500 --> 22:09.700]  technocracy in their own words and so we have to pray for president Trump and I
[22:09.700 --> 22:13.940]  hope to pray for info wars as well because we're all in this together and
[22:13.940 --> 22:17.260]  the truest thing Trump ever said is listen they don't hate me they it's they
[22:17.260 --> 22:21.460]  hate you I'm just standing between them and you and they've got to come through
[22:21.460 --> 22:27.300]  me and that's absolutely true they say you will own nothing you will have
[22:27.300 --> 22:31.900]  nothing robots will control your life because you're dirty you're bad so the
[22:31.900 --> 22:36.180]  freedom starts with not wearing your mask I went to a dental office this morning
[22:36.180 --> 22:41.220]  didn't wear a mask educated everybody there stayed there 20 minutes longer to
[22:41.220 --> 22:45.900]  talk to everyone and and because humans are supposed to talk and we're supposed
[22:45.900 --> 22:50.620]  to warn people and I use the mask issue of wear your mask to talk to all those
[22:50.620 --> 22:56.860]  people I came in contact with and when I walked out I wouldn't wear a mask when I
[22:56.860 --> 23:01.820]  walked out they weren't wearing their mask so that's what human intelligence is
[23:01.820 --> 23:07.780]  about it's about leadership it's not about how the strongman stumbled and and
[23:07.780 --> 23:10.660]  while the critics sat up there in the bleachers that Teddy Roosevelt talked
[23:10.660 --> 23:16.180]  about it's about what we do now together and we put Trump in populist put him in
[23:16.180 --> 23:22.460]  imagine him is like an arrow we fired is every little feather on the back of the
[23:22.460 --> 23:27.900]  arrow perfect is it is the point perfectly straight is the shaft of the
[23:27.900 --> 23:36.140]  wood of the arrow the best arrow ever made no but we set Trump to the bow we
[23:36.140 --> 23:42.260]  pulled back we released Trump fired and fired true and crippled the globalists
[23:42.260 --> 23:48.780]  and exposed them the arrow went through missed the heart hit along the enemy's
[23:48.780 --> 23:54.620]  coughing blood up metaphysically they're in trouble and they need to defeat us
[23:54.620 --> 24:00.060]  now decisively or they're going down so that's an arrow we fired that's an
[24:00.060 --> 24:08.340]  arrow we summoned appreciate that arrow the enemy needs you to forsake it so it
[24:08.340 --> 24:13.700]  can pull the arrow out and then if you let them they will break the arrow and
[24:13.700 --> 24:19.940]  metaphysically be healed they want to take Trump a victory of ours and make us
[24:19.940 --> 24:24.340]  forsake our victory and make us not stand with our victory and when we join
[24:24.340 --> 24:29.620]  the timid souls in ganging up on him we gang up on ourselves we learn from his
[24:29.620 --> 24:36.540]  mistakes we learn from our mistakes but Trump was risen up and given to us by
[24:36.540 --> 24:42.500]  God he was a sucker punched the globalist but Trump didn't create the
[24:42.500 --> 24:48.540]  revolution he rode in on a surfboard on the waves that millions of us and our
[24:48.540 --> 24:53.220]  forebearers created in the fight for liberty over thousands of years in this
[24:53.220 --> 25:02.020]  title struggle and so I could snap my fingers and come out against Trump and
[25:02.020 --> 25:06.340]  come out against the Second Amendment and I can't get into details because it's
[25:06.340 --> 25:10.740]  private things that are done that's just how the law works as long as something
[25:10.740 --> 25:13.460]  is illegal I will go have private meetings with the globalists of their
[25:13.460 --> 25:17.420]  minions and but I mean I can snap my fingers and betray the Second Amendment
[25:17.420 --> 25:21.860]  betray America betray Trump to make it so easy just come out against the second
[25:21.860 --> 25:26.460]  moment just a little bit come out for red flag laws or or or come out for just
[25:26.460 --> 25:30.020]  against Trump a little or just leave radical Islam alone or just want to
[25:30.020 --> 25:33.900]  stop harping on this pedophilia thing all day and all your problems will stop
[25:33.900 --> 25:37.980]  Jones yeah Jones you can come back into the fold right now right now Jones you
[25:37.980 --> 25:41.780]  come back in really I can't great no I don't I don't want to come back in your
[25:41.780 --> 25:45.940]  fold I've never been in your fold I don't want to be in your fold but that's
[25:45.940 --> 25:49.780]  where this is people say well Jones you just said red flag laws is one of their
[25:49.780 --> 25:54.420]  stipulations Trump said he was for that Trump said that so they would say we
[25:54.420 --> 25:57.500]  want total gun confiscation and so he would shut it all down I agree it was a
[25:57.500 --> 26:02.100]  mistake I said it was whenever I talk about something Trump did why he thought
[26:02.100 --> 26:06.660]  he did the right thing I'm so you can get my take on why he did it doesn't mean
[26:06.660 --> 26:11.420]  I agree with it he said hey you shouldn't have to take the vaccine but oh here it
[26:11.420 --> 26:14.100]  is let's turn the economy back on because he gets that's the main mission
[26:14.100 --> 26:17.700]  they shut the economy back off doesn't mean I agree with him trying to defeat
[26:17.700 --> 26:22.340]  them in that capacity and it failed and he failed to do the right thing when it
[26:22.340 --> 26:27.060]  came to the censorship and now he knows that and now the whole world knows that
[26:27.060 --> 26:32.460]  it doesn't matter now we move on now it's Joe Biden who is a fraud who we will
[26:32.460 --> 26:36.340]  never accept who's gonna come after us hardcore we have to go the
[26:36.340 --> 26:40.340]  offense against him because he runs a globalist crime family against our
[26:40.340 --> 26:46.700]  nation has fully compromised so Trump will be gone in five days trust the
[26:46.700 --> 26:52.660]  plan right unbelievable with a ride back on Alex Jones tomorrow's news today in

[29:56.140 --> 30:01.580]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[30:09.420 --> 30:16.020]  we are back live broadcasting worldwide I am your host Alex Jones well
[30:16.020 --> 30:22.220]  Andres Manuel Lopez Orbador it's like you call that a riot have you seen the
[30:22.220 --> 30:28.420]  Mexican riots we've got sometimes hundreds dead that's what goes on that's
[30:28.420 --> 30:31.620]  what happened in England at least have a riots in England hundreds of years ago
[30:31.620 --> 30:35.740]  where half the city would burn I'm not even saying riots are good but they're
[30:35.740 --> 30:39.060]  calling what happened at the Capitol last week Pearl Harbor the end of the
[30:39.060 --> 30:43.740]  world he says what is this the Spanish Inquisition you kick a president off
[30:43.740 --> 30:49.220]  and his tweets weren't even bad you people are crazy and you're dangerous
[30:49.220 --> 30:54.820]  now now why is he saying that because it is and why is Merkel now saying well
[30:54.820 --> 30:58.420]  we're allowed to censor as the government which he shouldn't do but you
[30:58.420 --> 31:03.220]  can't you know have these people doing it and big tech is more powerful than
[31:03.220 --> 31:06.540]  governments now it's authoritarian so I said the libertarians out there I get
[31:06.540 --> 31:11.500]  your libertarian ideals but once corporations become governmental how do
[31:11.500 --> 31:18.220]  you have a check and a balance oh start a new company and then they kick you
[31:18.220 --> 31:22.260]  off of every company you've got we've been kicked off of over a hundred
[31:22.260 --> 31:25.020]  platforms
[31:25.340 --> 31:33.820]  parlor says they may never come back up because if you take parlor which is
[31:33.820 --> 31:37.140]  conservatives liberals you name it gay straight everything just a more
[31:37.140 --> 31:41.220]  libertarian platform like Twitter used to be or Facebook just a few years ago
[31:41.220 --> 31:52.420]  if you do that then you get shut down and that's how this works I had a link
[31:52.420 --> 31:56.380]  in account that I guess one of the managers around here years ago set up
[31:56.380 --> 32:00.100]  so they could get more contacts from my contacts wasn't even authorized they
[32:00.100 --> 32:03.940]  took that away from me because I'm not supposed to be able to get a job I'm an
[32:03.940 --> 32:09.860]  evil red-blooded American I'm bad and how everybody wouldn't see that as a
[32:09.860 --> 32:15.020]  fundamental threat to themselves what you what happened to me could happen to
[32:15.020 --> 32:19.340]  you that's what empathy is that's why when you see a kid run over in the
[32:19.340 --> 32:23.900]  street you feel like your child just died because you have the same wiring and
[32:23.900 --> 32:28.220]  if you didn't have empathy you'd be a psycho
[32:29.980 --> 32:35.420]  so member builds your own platform really they have left us organizations like
[32:35.420 --> 32:39.460]  media matters and people that run scripts on our shopping cart with hackers
[32:39.460 --> 32:43.540]  trying to find out what we're using so they can take it down hey they say he
[32:43.540 --> 32:49.300]  shouldn't be allowed to operate they run around tattling constantly filing false
[32:49.300 --> 32:53.020]  reports that Jones is a terrorist and he's be arrested oh they're gonna be
[32:53.020 --> 32:58.900]  really upset to hear this and I'll get to the news overhead shop please Alex
[32:58.900 --> 33:02.580]  Jones the FBI wants me to come in for questioning about the January 6th attack
[33:02.580 --> 33:07.460]  on the Capitol well I've got some bad news for you our lawyers talked to the
[33:07.460 --> 33:13.620]  FBI they just said look we have to follow every fake report and the left
[33:13.620 --> 33:17.380]  has said you did this and we're just asking you did you do it we know and
[33:17.380 --> 33:21.500]  no we did the left is reporting that we attacked the building and commanded it
[33:21.500 --> 33:28.780]  all and so the FBI that has to make so so the crime is the left filing false
[33:28.780 --> 33:34.060]  reports you think I'm scared you ought to be scared that you think it's cool to
[33:34.060 --> 33:38.900]  do stuff like that I've never filed a fake report on media matters but the guy
[33:38.900 --> 33:43.300]  that bankrolls at George Soros has bought off over 500 district attorneys in this
[33:43.300 --> 33:48.860]  country that runs who gets charged and who doesn't what if Locosa Nostra was
[33:48.860 --> 33:52.740]  trying to control district attorneys they might have controlled one in Boston and
[33:52.740 --> 33:58.420]  it was a huge scandal with Whitey Bolger they might have controlled one FBI
[33:58.420 --> 34:02.260]  agent and then the district attorney in Boston and it's an international
[34:02.260 --> 34:07.420]  scandal to this day oh but George Soros he just runs almost every city and it's
[34:07.420 --> 34:13.260]  alright and you left us like feel powerful that you're involved with that
[34:13.260 --> 34:16.780]  like oh that's cool they're all over Twitter like oh Jones we can't wait till
[34:16.780 --> 34:21.300]  you're in jail oh it's gonna be oh yeah we got to reeducate everybody we got to
[34:21.300 --> 34:26.220]  arrest all the conservatives we got to take their children from them the head
[34:26.220 --> 34:32.460]  lawyer the chief counsel of PBS billions in management under management sitting
[34:32.460 --> 34:36.140]  there like a super creepy not saying he's a pedophile I'm just saying he looks
[34:36.140 --> 34:40.700]  like one go here we're just gonna take the parents to reeducation camps and
[34:40.700 --> 34:44.940]  we're gonna take their children oh we're gonna have their children and their
[34:44.940 --> 34:48.580]  children are gonna be with us and then the head of the UN rapid response says
[34:48.580 --> 34:54.940]  we gotta go in the houses and take the children because it's weird little
[34:54.940 --> 35:04.140]  teeth is all these videos of their children I mean what the hell is going
[35:04.140 --> 35:11.180]  on here and the left everyone wants to be signed on to all this Paul Watson
[35:11.180 --> 35:14.460]  asked me like what's going on with Jack Dorsey he says he's for free speech and
[35:14.460 --> 35:17.300]  he hates the fact that Trump was censored but then now there's this video
[35:17.300 --> 35:20.620]  where he's admitting it all that he is censoring his employees like a man with
[35:20.620 --> 35:23.900]  a gun to his head and I think that's basically it he's blackmailed for whatever
[35:23.900 --> 35:28.540]  reason of this and so I told Paul why not just tell you this now it's not like a
[35:28.540 --> 35:32.380]  bragging thing I don't care it's actually weird I think it's strange I've been
[35:32.380 --> 35:39.500]  told by two famous prominent people that Jack Dorsey says Alex Jones is always
[35:39.500 --> 35:44.420]  right and that I'm like his guru and then there's this big famous Hollywood
[35:44.420 --> 35:50.420]  producer I'm not gonna go any further it's big music producer but like it's
[35:50.420 --> 35:53.420]  like their guru and then he's like listens to me all the time I'm being
[35:53.420 --> 35:57.020]  told this by two separate really famous people and this is like a while back and
[35:57.020 --> 36:01.620]  I'm like okay all right I mean this is you can't make up the weirdness level so
[36:01.620 --> 36:07.980]  so the reason I tell you the story now is there are a lot of people that work in
[36:07.980 --> 36:11.220]  the system that don't actually run anything anymore and are just a front
[36:11.220 --> 36:16.180]  person and have a gun to their head and most men I found when there's a gun to
[36:16.180 --> 36:21.740]  their head either for real or financially or metaphysically they go along but
[36:21.740 --> 36:26.500]  then behind the scenes they sneak around and try to fight the system and I'm
[36:26.500 --> 36:30.900]  not saying that's Jack Dorsey I'm not saying but I'm like with one famous
[36:30.900 --> 36:33.500]  person I was like yeah I was talking about Jack about you today how great you
[36:33.500 --> 36:36.820]  are and how you're always right I go yeah yeah right I'm always ready oh here's
[36:36.820 --> 36:42.580]  the text message Jack Dorsey well she talks about you all the time and I'm
[36:42.580 --> 36:48.100]  just like oh really and I got told that years ago but this is about me bragging
[36:48.100 --> 36:52.980]  it's the opposite of that what weird-ass world is it that Jack Dorsey's
[36:52.980 --> 36:57.220]  obsessed with me well of course they're all obsessed with this show what are we
[36:57.220 --> 37:01.220]  talking about here the real world ladies and gentlemen it's not me anybody can
[37:01.220 --> 37:04.900]  read the great reset anybody can go look up this time I mean the Mexican
[37:04.900 --> 37:07.980]  president says this is incredible tyranny we've got to stop it of course
[37:07.980 --> 37:13.980]  he's right I don't care he's a socialist what matters is that you
[37:13.980 --> 37:20.500]  recognize truth ladies and gentlemen and we have out of control tyranny
[37:20.500 --> 37:24.980]  attacking us you think Joe Biden's a real socialist when he works with the
[37:24.980 --> 37:29.140]  common Chinese where they have hundreds and hundreds of billionaires and then
[37:29.140 --> 37:34.420]  they work families to death no that's not communism that's not socialism we'll
[37:34.420 --> 37:36.660]  end up helping the Mexicans at the end of the day they got a socialist that
[37:36.660 --> 37:39.900]  actually tries to take something incredible wealth Mexico's the richest
[37:39.900 --> 37:44.980]  country in the world as far as their their elite is the richest elite per
[37:44.980 --> 37:48.820]  capital for their population size of anywhere in the world why are there
[37:48.820 --> 37:54.580]  people so poor because they keep them that way to control them could oh this
[37:54.580 --> 37:59.100]  guy fix it somehow by divesting it back to people maybe but it usually goes the
[37:59.100 --> 38:03.660]  way of Venezuela free markets the way to go but they never had an original
[38:03.660 --> 38:08.060]  revolution to get land and the means of production of the people's hands and the
[38:08.060 --> 38:10.780]  way to get the means of production of people's hands is not communism and
[38:10.780 --> 38:14.420]  some central committee of professors that don't know how to wipe their ass
[38:14.420 --> 38:18.820]  distributing money you distribute the means of production into the middle
[38:18.820 --> 38:24.260]  class that vibrantly then competes and that produces wealth the problem is it
[38:24.260 --> 38:29.660]  then produces incredible decadence okay I'm done ranting I've got so much to hit
[38:29.660 --> 38:32.140]  when we come back and I've not plugged and I don't plug we're not going to be

[41:22.620 --> 41:28.020]  set up I was there in DC with a million peaceful people and I watch Antifa and
[41:28.020 --> 41:33.140]  other leftist groups pose our people and set us up thank God the patriots did
[41:33.140 --> 41:37.540]  not engage in the rioting so only a few people did it so the thing was a
[41:37.540 --> 41:42.900]  misfire it was a dud but the left is hungry to declare all Trump supporters
[41:42.900 --> 41:46.380]  terrorists and they're planning terrorist attacks and mass shootings on the
[41:46.380 --> 41:52.020]  20th to blame the American people do not be part of it we are peaceful we are not

[44:16.140 --> 44:18.780]  cool I don't want to be part of Holly let only part of the Washington power
[44:18.780 --> 44:25.220]  structure it really is true that you cannot register or fathom how popular
[44:25.220 --> 44:30.420]  info wars really is now and that was all God's plan and that was all you keeping
[44:30.420 --> 44:34.540]  us on air all of us together was a team effort it's extremely dangerous position
[44:34.540 --> 44:38.180]  to be in as well but almost all these liberal talk show house and attack me
[44:38.180 --> 44:41.940]  they actually listen I remember Mike Cernovich about five years ago four years
[44:41.940 --> 44:45.020]  ago he was visiting here he says don't you know they all love you and they all
[44:45.020 --> 44:48.260]  listen all the time and don't you know all those big people like Jack Dorsey and
[44:48.260 --> 44:52.020]  all their huge fans and don't and I'm like dude stop trying to build my ego up
[44:52.020 --> 44:56.540]  I don't want to hear this that's a bull it's all true
[44:56.820 --> 45:00.900]  but Cernovich was like you just shouldn't be as hardcore we ought to get it we get
[45:00.900 --> 45:05.660]  him on our side and then I had other big famous people tell me this way more
[45:05.660 --> 45:10.300]  famous than than him and I was like really such what I'm saying is there's a
[45:10.300 --> 45:15.260]  big struggle in the power structure and a lot of people that aren't devil
[45:15.260 --> 45:19.100]  worshipers I mean I mean look you look at Hillary Clinton that's a devil
[45:19.100 --> 45:23.820]  worshipers you look at her look at her actions you just see it Jack Dorsey no
[45:23.820 --> 45:28.300]  you think does that guy try and act like Obi-Wan Kenobi I don't know but you get
[45:28.300 --> 45:32.140]  kind of Obi-Wan Kenobi vibe not the pedophile vibe but that's what I'm
[45:32.140 --> 45:35.820]  saying is our spirit already knows what's going on here our subconscious
[45:35.820 --> 45:39.180]  whatever you want to call it is powerful hundreds of times thousands of times
[45:39.180 --> 45:43.100]  we're powerful in our conscious mind and
[45:43.100 --> 45:51.140]  it's so crazy because this actually this really happened I remember about a year
[45:51.140 --> 45:58.100]  ago visiting my a little bit over a year ago my wife's mother in San Diego and
[45:58.100 --> 46:03.020]  so her house is little so we said well let's go to this nice country club that
[46:03.020 --> 46:08.580]  has a hotel beautiful place it was the Fairmount beautiful hotel in a golf
[46:08.580 --> 46:11.660]  course we can walk around the golf course and stuff and I remember there were
[46:11.660 --> 46:17.300]  all these chemtrails all the chemical spraying that they add to them jet fuel
[46:17.300 --> 46:21.740]  and it's all in the patents and it's all in the it's all in the Nobel Prizes I
[46:21.740 --> 46:25.380]  mean it's been going on since the mid 90s it's a perfect case of this
[46:25.380 --> 46:28.660]  industrial globalist takeover how it's just there and general public doesn't
[46:28.660 --> 46:32.060]  know but it's hidden in plain view and I said man I would have a website or a
[46:32.060 --> 46:38.740]  podcast I told my wife this called chemtrails and country clubs because
[46:38.740 --> 46:42.340]  you're in this beautiful country club these beautiful pools beautiful statues
[46:42.340 --> 46:47.980]  five-star hotel I never stayed some more of that nice and
[46:49.700 --> 46:54.380]  there's chemtrails everywhere and it's just raining down on everyone and it's
[46:54.380 --> 46:59.020]  that symbol of how this has happened to everyone so then I get up about 5 a.m. I
[46:59.020 --> 47:05.580]  go get on the computer and research and I see oh well that's it
[47:05.580 --> 47:16.020]  this big pop star she must be an Alex Jones Lister because her new album is
[47:16.020 --> 47:24.940]  called chemtrails over the country club
[47:24.940 --> 47:35.220]  Lane Adele Ray and man then the music video halfway in has a turn I'm gonna play
[47:35.220 --> 47:41.420]  it at the end of the hour or the end of the next hour and it goes into Jeffrey
[47:41.420 --> 47:46.980]  Epstein devil worship Wow see that's what I mean what we're covering here isn't
[47:46.980 --> 47:53.300]  the hottest thing in entertainment because it's not entertainment what we're
[47:53.300 --> 48:00.020]  here covering is the awakening of humanity to the hidden that is now
[48:00.020 --> 48:05.460]  being brought up against us so it's an amazing time to be alive Larry Pinkney
[48:05.460 --> 48:11.180]  is one of the greatest patriots I know he's been a political prisoner he's
[48:11.180 --> 48:14.500]  been to the ringer he's one of the original founders of the black panther
[48:14.500 --> 48:18.820]  party not the new black panther party that's just a black KKK group run by the
[48:18.820 --> 48:26.060]  feds but the real group and he always has a lot to say about what
[48:26.060 --> 48:28.660]  we're witnessing what's unfolding he'll be with us and then I'm trying to get
[48:28.660 --> 48:31.860]  him on for a year people been asking where is Steve Quayle I don't know I
[48:31.860 --> 48:36.180]  really admire Steve Quayle as well he's a really smart guy Steve Quayle will be
[48:36.180 --> 48:41.220]  with us in the third hour I gotta call him the anti-Q you know you're always
[48:41.220 --> 48:45.100]  being told everything's fine by Q and trust the plan and don't worry about it
[48:45.100 --> 48:50.580]  well Steve Quayle is kind of the anti-Q I mean he's he's definitely not a Q
[48:50.580 --> 48:57.820]  person and you know Quayle never told me this then I ran into real spooks and like
[48:57.820 --> 49:00.940]  real famous ones and they go oh yeah you know you don't know Steve Quayle is
[49:00.940 --> 49:06.300]  he's a he's something else so Steve Quayle's had a long lifetime let's just
[49:06.300 --> 49:11.380]  leave it at that and seen a lot and he is a smart guy and I knew the guy 27 years
[49:11.380 --> 49:16.020]  ago is one of the first guest I ever had on and I had no idea back then what a
[49:16.020 --> 49:21.420]  visionary he was but he knew how to get his message out in a pop way so that it
[49:21.420 --> 49:24.580]  would actually get on national TV and things so he'll give us his take on the
[49:24.580 --> 49:28.580]  world coming up in the third hour I had another great friend of mine and that is
[49:28.580 --> 49:33.500]  a guy that we talked to every week and that is Dr. Nick Begich his father was
[49:33.500 --> 49:38.700]  murdered his brother's been a US senator and who has trailblazed all these top
[49:38.700 --> 49:42.740]  science systems being used to manipulate us the 5G all of it he'll be
[49:42.740 --> 49:48.300]  hosting the fourth hour today ahead of the war room the big news is now at
[49:48.300 --> 49:53.940]  infowars.com and it's exactly what I told you that I personally witnessed
[49:53.940 --> 50:03.540]  because I know the cut of somebody's jib I saw over a hundred skinny jeans
[50:03.540 --> 50:09.180]  anti-foot types that I would call the upper crust usually graduate students
[50:09.180 --> 50:14.500]  sons of US senators you know kind of the mafia of these people but they look like
[50:14.500 --> 50:17.260]  vampires just like the lower level methadones but they're kind of usually
[50:17.260 --> 50:20.580]  about six foot one six foot two but real skinny you know kind of count
[50:20.580 --> 50:24.300]  Dracula-ish I got on the elevator with some time before last DC I was just
[50:24.300 --> 50:27.260]  shocked by evil they were without their mask on so it's kind of the children of
[50:27.260 --> 50:33.020]  the Satanist and I saw them there and I got there 30 minutes after it started
[50:33.020 --> 50:36.860]  and so I said looks like Antifa now they've had a lot of arrest of Antifa
[50:36.860 --> 50:41.060]  that we're posing as Trump people that did help break in and did say burn it
[50:41.060 --> 50:44.940]  down did try to get it did egg the woman on to crash with the window that got
[50:44.940 --> 50:50.140]  shot I mean it's he's been indicted for that and so the article is breaking an
[50:50.140 --> 50:55.020]  infowars.com right now feds admit capital seeds was planned in advance by
[50:55.020 --> 51:00.860]  Trump haters not Trump supporters the planning was done by Antifa posing as
[51:00.860 --> 51:07.660]  patriots online using the Q-Tard boards to hijack not what the Q Lord was saying
[51:07.660 --> 51:11.860]  because the Q Lord doesn't want to get in trouble but what the Antifa posing as
[51:11.860 --> 51:18.100]  Q priest Q leaders were doing and I don't think the Q Shaman was involved but
[51:18.100 --> 51:21.300]  it just shows that they all call themselves shamans this is an esoteric
[51:21.300 --> 51:25.580]  religion and the standard thing to attack me when I criticize Q is oh you
[51:25.580 --> 51:30.540]  don't want competition let me explain something as this show went mainstream by
[51:30.540 --> 51:35.060]  the world woke up to the truth we were exploding already Q helped us so much
[51:35.060 --> 51:40.980]  Q brought us so many new listeners the Q movement made it fun and non-threatening
[51:40.980 --> 51:45.900]  for people that can't face this evil and think that we could lose they wanted to
[51:45.900 --> 51:49.460]  hear we can win and so I started thinking well maybe Q's all right about a
[51:49.460 --> 51:53.540]  year ago because it's getting so many people on board but then as I realized
[51:53.540 --> 51:58.260]  no they're gonna betray us at the end with violence and make people stand down
[51:58.260 --> 52:05.060]  so Trump doesn't get reelected I saw it as a problem no it hurts me and our
[52:05.060 --> 52:11.540]  audience to talk about Q but I have to do it I have to do it it's not the average
[52:11.540 --> 52:17.940]  woman or man a lot of my crew have fathers that are engineers for whatever
[52:17.940 --> 52:21.700]  reason a lot of people that work here's fathers are chemical engineers
[52:21.700 --> 52:28.100]  electrical engineers you know with doctorate degrees from major universities
[52:28.100 --> 52:33.100]  they all loved it they all because it's designed to be augmented reality a lot
[52:33.100 --> 52:37.180]  of the stuff was in there is real real US intelligence was in Q but not what you
[52:37.180 --> 52:41.980]  thought it was giving you intel so you'd see a lot of it is true but at the end
[52:41.980 --> 52:45.860]  it's like it's like put the big juicy worm on a hook and I'm a bass saying
[52:45.860 --> 52:50.420]  don't eat that Bob or you know Ralph or the other back that's got a hook in it
[52:50.420 --> 52:53.500]  and they'll take you up to a whole nother galaxy a whole nother dimension
[52:53.500 --> 52:57.380]  it's weird you'll die they'll eat you he's like oh shut up there's nothing up
[52:57.380 --> 53:01.940]  there that's a juicy worm you bite it and you got a hook in your mouth though
[53:01.940 --> 53:08.140]  a lot of the impose real it's a big juicy worm but there's a big metal spike
[53:08.140 --> 53:12.900]  inside there with a hook on it so that's where we're at so we're gonna break all
[53:12.900 --> 53:19.300]  that down Larry pink me coming up in the next hour and so much more Trump is set
[53:19.300 --> 53:22.780]  to declassify today they're saying they'll drag their feet don't worry all
[53:22.780 --> 53:27.940]  the FBI files on Russiagate devastating stuff but I mean tell Hunter Biden
[53:27.940 --> 53:31.700]  laptop so devastating they don't deny that I'm going I work for the Chinese
[53:31.700 --> 53:37.580]  intelligence I'm under criminal investigation with my dad the head of
[53:37.580 --> 53:46.380]  Alibaba is missing mama I mean these are once a spoiled lawyers Biden's just
[53:46.380 --> 53:49.900]  gonna sit in there and like literally just though I don't get 50 million a
[53:49.900 --> 53:54.220]  month now I get a billion a month that's all bides to do is stare at his bank
[53:54.220 --> 53:59.420]  account numbers and a little demon and then molest children I mean that's all
[53:59.420 --> 54:04.220]  these I mean this guy's in photos molesting his niece we got we got the
[54:04.220 --> 54:08.660]  diaries of the daughter all of it with daddy screw it and all the rest of it I
[54:08.660 --> 54:12.460]  mean and look at people like oh they're gonna come out to you Jones you help

[55:29.700 --> 55:33.500]  secret of how the quail don't have the seasonal distress and it's passed on

[55:53.940 --> 56:00.180]  force for a political or financial reason it's basically scaring the hell out
[56:00.180 --> 56:04.260]  of people until you submit to them that's exactly what all this overblown
[56:04.260 --> 56:09.060]  COVID-19 garbage is you see the headlines from CNN ABC News doctors say
[56:09.060 --> 56:12.260]  it's worse than they ever thought COVID more dumbest thing they could ever
[56:12.260 --> 56:17.620]  imagine they told us that two and a half million people would be dead just eight
[56:17.620 --> 56:23.180]  months ago within three months okay it's a quarter million if you count all of
[56:23.180 --> 56:27.660]  the people that died of other things we're talking 96% had comorbidity these
[56:27.660 --> 56:31.380]  are real numbers these are real facts this is the chicken little event we'll
[56:31.380 --> 56:35.220]  run our houses never come out and are taught we're not essential all the big
[56:35.220 --> 56:39.180]  box stores in Amazon take over the planet review could stand up against it
[56:39.180 --> 56:45.300]  this is slavery it is not something you could put up with and survive

[57:36.420 --> 57:39.620]  Panther Party the original one not the new one run by the Southern Prairie Law
[57:39.620 --> 57:47.500]  Center his book saying no to power black activist wg.org black activist
[57:47.500 --> 57:52.540]  riders guild and he has been a political prisoner you name it so Larry we
[57:52.540 --> 57:56.660]  really appreciate you here in the 21st century the 21st year of the 21st
[57:56.660 --> 58:02.100]  century and just just God bless you give us all a prelude in the next 45
[58:02.100 --> 58:04.860]  minutes or so what you're gonna break down for us your view on where we are
[58:04.860 --> 58:10.820]  right now okay thank you Alex you know I believe that it is always a distinct
[58:10.820 --> 58:16.140]  pleasure spending time with you and all of my brothers and sisters of all
[58:16.140 --> 58:22.340]  colors at info wars and the wonderful audience now let me get right to it some
[58:22.340 --> 58:29.100]  of the things I want to deal with would be for example the neoliberal fascism of
[58:29.100 --> 58:34.780]  the so-called Democrat Party that's one thing I also want to break down with a
[58:34.780 --> 58:41.940]  called inflammatory rhetoric all right I also want to talk about actions you
[58:41.940 --> 58:47.020]  talked about terrorism so I want to address that using a very specific
[58:47.020 --> 58:54.020]  example the other thing I want to talk about is quite frankly the so-called
[58:54.020 --> 58:59.020]  mainstream media and I say so-called that's it in the nutshell those are the
[58:59.020 --> 59:06.380]  things I'd like to address well as soon as the last week I knew that you've been
[59:06.380 --> 59:09.020]  through the ringer you've been set up as a political prisoner you can really
[59:09.020 --> 59:12.620]  warn people with your expert eye on what you see because I see it from
[59:12.620 --> 59:16.220]  historical research you've lived it on there obviously trying to foment
[59:16.220 --> 59:19.180]  uprisings are trying to claim it's black against white white against black it's
[59:19.180 --> 59:24.180]  obviously not and it is a corporate globalist system trying to divide this
[59:24.180 --> 59:29.220]  country yet again and trying to outlaw the practice of demonstrating of course
[59:29.220 --> 59:37.100]  and you know speaking of inflammatory and speaking of division all right the
[59:37.100 --> 59:44.700]  whole tactic has been all about dividing conquer control manipulate okay
[59:44.700 --> 59:49.700]  that's what it's always been about and the neoliberal fascist Democrats and
[59:49.700 --> 59:56.140]  their allies of the so-called media have engaged in this and are continuing to
[59:56.140 --> 1:00:01.220]  engage in this I want you to think about the inflammatory rhetoric of people
[1:00:01.220 --> 1:00:08.700]  like Maxine Waters who is telling people to go and to confront quote unquote
[1:00:08.700 --> 1:00:15.020]  people in their homes in restaurants wherever they might be to confront those
[1:00:15.020 --> 1:00:21.140]  people who were exercising their constitutional rights as citizens to
[1:00:21.140 --> 1:00:26.540]  support the candidate of their choice and in this case was president Donald J
[1:00:26.540 --> 1:00:31.700]  Trump that's inflammatory rhetoric but of course we never hear anything about
[1:00:31.700 --> 1:00:37.860]  that that's okay right well let's talk about terrorism for a moment I want you
[1:00:37.860 --> 1:00:44.540]  to go back to me there I'll go back with me very briefly in a time machine the
[1:00:44.540 --> 1:00:49.180]  time machine is just of a few years ago all right we're talking the summer of
[1:00:49.180 --> 1:00:57.100]  2017 what happened what terrorist act took place well a man who hated Donald
[1:00:57.100 --> 1:01:02.780]  Trump publicly and repeatedly a supporter of Democrats and in this case
[1:01:02.780 --> 1:01:12.780]  Bernie Sanders a man by the name of James T. Hodgkinson actually fired and
[1:01:12.780 --> 1:01:20.940]  wounded okay when I say fired I'm saying using a gun and wounded multiple people
[1:01:20.940 --> 1:01:28.020]  including including a member of the US House of Representatives by the name of
[1:01:28.020 --> 1:01:31.860]  Steve Scalise all right well stay there we're gonna recap this and you're gonna
[1:01:31.860 --> 1:01:36.220]  go over all the real agitating the real terrorism versus what happened at the
[1:01:36.220 --> 1:01:40.380]  Capitol and where you think all this is going with Biden and Trump Larry
[1:01:40.380 --> 1:01:44.300]  Picney one of the original founders of the real Black Panther Party not be
[1:01:44.300 --> 1:01:48.020]  confused with the new KKK one we'll be right back in 60 seconds with Larry

[1:02:04.300 --> 1:02:08.180]  not be dependent on the system that's why they want to bankrupt the economy it's
[1:02:08.180 --> 1:02:11.700]  why they want to destroy the infrastructure of this nation because
[1:02:11.700 --> 1:02:16.100]  they want all of us on our knees so they can dictate our surrender to them

[1:04:12.660 --> 1:04:16.340]  the feathery would have to admit that it was staged by Antifa that did indeed
[1:04:16.340 --> 1:04:20.260]  trick some patriots once the riot police started attacking to then attack
[1:04:20.260 --> 1:04:24.580]  the riot police so everyone's being played here and it turns out it's this
[1:04:24.580 --> 1:04:30.660]  former top general son who was in trouble for having misplaced nuclear bomb
[1:04:30.660 --> 1:04:36.700]  triggers I'm not joking that has his son out there everywhere getting

[1:05:04.700 --> 1:05:10.340]  person undercover so I know what Antifa looks like folks you know what
[1:05:10.340 --> 1:05:13.820]  different groups people look like I mean you know a legitimate group of say
[1:05:13.820 --> 1:05:17.220]  farmers that are protesting you know what farmers look like whether it be
[1:05:17.220 --> 1:05:21.460]  Hispanic black white you know what when it's a real a pro-life protest you go

[1:05:40.020 --> 1:05:44.540]  of thousands go in and we're told this is as big as Pearl Harbor but but you go
[1:05:44.540 --> 1:05:49.140]  back over what you were saying Maxine waters all of its saying selling BLM go
[1:05:49.140 --> 1:05:53.220]  attack people at restaurants not just exercise in First Amendment they tried I
[1:05:53.220 --> 1:05:56.520]  mean I'm a tough guy you're a tough guy I'm not I don't want to go in a
[1:05:56.520 --> 1:06:00.500]  restaurant and randomly at night start throwing glasses at people's tables I'm
[1:06:00.500 --> 1:06:04.300]  gonna get my ass beat but they actually tell black folks and white folks go out
[1:06:04.300 --> 1:06:08.020]  and attack white people at restaurants that's a good way to get killed so so
[1:06:08.020 --> 1:06:11.420]  they're definitely they were trying an insurgency you're one of the leading
[1:06:11.420 --> 1:06:15.060]  experts on this over 50 years living through it what's really going on Larry
[1:06:15.060 --> 1:06:21.340]  Pickney what's really going on is we're seeing coin tell pro on steroids let me
[1:06:21.340 --> 1:06:25.660]  repeat that we're seeing coin tell pro the counterintelligence program on
[1:06:25.660 --> 1:06:31.380]  steroids let's understand that the neoliberal fascist Democrats have always
[1:06:31.380 --> 1:06:37.740]  been about subterfuge always this is not new those back to the 1860s all right
[1:06:37.740 --> 1:06:44.580]  but let's go back to the 1960s all right the 1960s and the 1970s for example
[1:06:44.580 --> 1:06:50.900]  where the Democrats and I might add some rhino Republicans but the Democrats
[1:06:50.900 --> 1:06:56.740]  primarily pushed a program called coin tell pro the counterintelligence program
[1:06:56.740 --> 1:07:02.100]  which was set up to frame murder discredit in prison etc those who were
[1:07:02.100 --> 1:07:06.740]  dissidents it was almost like the former Soviet Union people need to
[1:07:06.740 --> 1:07:13.260]  understand where we are today now don't be intimidated but understand it all
[1:07:13.260 --> 1:07:17.660]  right now I was talking about maxine waters as an example
[1:07:17.660 --> 1:07:24.180]  inflammatory rhetoric of course that's what maxine waters is all about
[1:07:24.180 --> 1:07:30.780]  inflammatory rhetoric but is she called on the carpet of course not what about
[1:07:30.780 --> 1:07:37.660]  James T. Hodgkinson who actually fired shots and wounded a member of the US
[1:07:37.660 --> 1:07:44.500]  Congress in the summer of 2017 what about him I guess he's okay notice how the
[1:07:44.500 --> 1:07:50.700]  media played that down where is their ongoing outrage at this if they want to
[1:07:50.700 --> 1:07:55.100]  talk about shots having been fired let's go back to when the first ones were
[1:07:55.100 --> 1:08:02.100]  fired let's go back to the Democrat supporters all right let's be honest
[1:08:02.100 --> 1:08:08.380]  let's be real and if you don't believe me go go it James T. Hodgkinson summer of
[1:08:08.380 --> 1:08:16.180]  2017 who did he support okay who was he for he was an avid hater of President
[1:08:16.180 --> 1:08:21.940]  Trump he was an avid hater of a free republic and that's what we have
[1:08:21.940 --> 1:08:27.740]  brothers and sisters this is a constitutional republic now which been
[1:08:27.740 --> 1:08:34.900]  ushered in okay through cheating and other means cheating and intimidation
[1:08:34.900 --> 1:08:41.820]  what has been ushered in is what I call the hypocrisy of the Democrats so-called
[1:08:41.820 --> 1:08:49.140]  democracy the hypocrisy of the so-called Democrats so-called okay
[1:08:49.140 --> 1:08:54.180]  democracy don't forget that remember that and then when let's stop and think
[1:08:54.180 --> 1:08:59.540]  for a moment all right they use the when I say they let me be specific the
[1:08:59.540 --> 1:09:05.380]  Democrats and their allies so-called progressive it's right give me a break
[1:09:05.380 --> 1:09:12.140]  they're talking about Liz Cheney all these war criminals that's correct
[1:09:12.140 --> 1:09:18.100]  that's correct and they are indeed war criminal all right it's a matter of
[1:09:18.100 --> 1:09:25.860]  documented fact but let's move on they use the the race flash color thing as a
[1:09:25.860 --> 1:09:32.220]  divide and conquer method right you know people and it's so sad for me as a
[1:09:32.220 --> 1:09:38.340]  proud black American to see so people who got behind I don't think it was the
[1:09:38.340 --> 1:09:42.180]  majority but that's the least on camera he's talking about they got shot the
[1:09:42.180 --> 1:09:45.580]  middle that I saw Wolf Blitzer have a guest on saying the guy that shot him
[1:09:45.580 --> 1:09:49.180]  was a hero and Wolf Blitzer nodded his head so they actually say shoot
[1:09:49.180 --> 1:09:53.500]  congressman but now they call what happened to them Pearl Harbor is not
[1:09:53.500 --> 1:09:58.300]  ridiculous isn't it if you know we'll talk about the ultimate scene up of
[1:09:58.300 --> 1:10:03.660]  hypocrisy it's a third but then let's understand something the Democrats and
[1:10:03.660 --> 1:10:10.380]  their allies and Antifa clan Tifa and Tifa clan Tifa capital K all right and
[1:10:10.380 --> 1:10:17.860]  BLM they are allies working together to basically destroy traditional families
[1:10:17.860 --> 1:10:23.020]  and values but let's go back to this thing of color and race so-called race
[1:10:23.020 --> 1:10:31.660]  all right who is Joe Biden let me tell you who Joe Biden is Joe Biden is the
[1:10:31.660 --> 1:10:38.060]  same person all right whose close friend and mentor was none other than the late
[1:10:38.060 --> 1:10:45.580]  Robert Byrd a Democrat and former Ku Klux Klan leader and recruiter good friend
[1:10:45.580 --> 1:10:52.140]  of Joe Biden in Biden's own words but hey that's not enough there's more what
[1:10:52.140 --> 1:11:01.740]  about and there they are and what about today okay wouldn't Biden say one of the
[1:11:01.740 --> 1:11:08.060]  most profoundly racist comments that has been made by any so-called political
[1:11:08.060 --> 1:11:14.380]  leader was made by Joe Biden who actually had the unmitigated audacity of an
[1:11:14.380 --> 1:11:22.220]  alley cat to insult our entire Republic and to actually say if you don't vote for
[1:11:22.220 --> 1:11:30.300]  me you quote ain't unquote black all right that is the ultimate of racism
[1:11:30.300 --> 1:11:36.460]  that's what Biden is about don't believe it look up look it up
[1:11:36.460 --> 1:11:41.340]  well boy what is he really saying I mean he's saying you're out entity I own like
[1:11:41.340 --> 1:11:47.420]  exactly exactly he's saying let's be honest let's be blunt let's be candid
[1:11:47.420 --> 1:11:54.620]  he's saying you're my slave nigga that's what he's saying let's be frank and I
[1:11:54.620 --> 1:12:01.100]  don't like the n-word but you know what the n-word is often times summed up by
[1:12:01.100 --> 1:12:06.580]  the actions of people just like Lyndon Baines Johnson who use the n-word so
[1:12:06.580 --> 1:12:12.020]  much that his own age that another Democrat by the way a former president
[1:12:12.020 --> 1:12:16.780]  who use the n-word so much that his own advisors had to tell him look no tone
[1:12:16.780 --> 1:12:22.380]  this down this is too obvious but who also said and look it up that quote
[1:12:22.380 --> 1:12:29.380]  niggers unquote will continue to vote for Democrats for the next 200 years
[1:12:29.380 --> 1:12:36.260]  huh that's Lyndon Johnson and what we have now with with this Biden character all
[1:12:36.260 --> 1:12:41.500]  right is is is Lyndon Johnson on Lyndon Johnson 2.0 I totally agree it's the
[1:12:41.500 --> 1:12:45.100]  exact same crap and they want us all in their plantation Larry Pickney is on
[1:12:45.100 --> 1:13:00.460]  fire as usual I'm Alex Jones we arrived back in a few minutes stay with us
[1:13:15.100 --> 1:13:22.100]  we launched a new URL before they banned it but Soros and Bill Gates and the
[1:13:22.100 --> 1:13:28.820]  globalists are on our tail but the new website is the resistance.video the
[1:13:28.820 --> 1:13:33.860]  resistance.video they're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can
[1:13:33.860 --> 1:13:38.580]  defeat them so the new URL that links right to band.video and all of our
[1:13:38.580 --> 1:13:42.180]  videos and all of our documentaries and all the special reports and all the
[1:13:42.180 --> 1:13:47.900]  press information is that the resistance.video share the link the resistance.video
[1:13:47.900 --> 1:13:53.820]  the resistance.video hey Alex how you doing man is this the guy that called in
[1:13:53.820 --> 1:13:58.060]  about living defense yes sir yes sir I've been trying to get a hold of you
[1:13:58.060 --> 1:14:02.620]  since Monday when I heard you got that fresh shipment of living defense in
[1:14:02.620 --> 1:14:08.380]  from Utah I said man I gotta get on that show and give him an update I said if I
[1:14:08.380 --> 1:14:13.300]  ever get a chance to be on Alex Jones show I'm gonna tell the world about
[1:14:13.300 --> 1:14:18.700]  living defense and what it did for me person now look I'm 64 years old going
[1:14:18.700 --> 1:14:24.100]  on 20 thanks to this info for store products and by the way I bought $800
[1:14:24.100 --> 1:14:29.620]  worth the other night so I'm doing what I can brother what my my contention is
[1:14:29.620 --> 1:14:34.060]  why don't we start this new year off right with everybody getting a couple
[1:14:34.060 --> 1:14:38.140]  bottles of living defense now you gotta follow that up with the Microsoft
[1:14:38.140 --> 1:14:43.140]  yes I learned that so it's like God working is so amazing we didn't know we
[1:14:43.140 --> 1:14:47.380]  didn't screen your call we had no idea and I go to you a year later you're
[1:14:47.380 --> 1:14:51.860]  telling people about living defense living defense living defense
[1:14:52.500 --> 1:14:57.860]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:14:57.860 --> 1:14:59.860]  you
[1:15:07.140 --> 1:15:12.140]  you don't think that senator Cain's son got caught and convicted a few years ago
[1:15:12.140 --> 1:15:15.860]  of beating people that entered their lives dressed up in an anti-fouled fit do
[1:15:15.860 --> 1:15:20.860]  you and also reportedly staging stuff blaming on right wingers no reason their
[1:15:20.860 --> 1:15:24.700]  kids have to all go out and do this and you've got this Sullivan character whose
[1:15:24.700 --> 1:15:30.620]  dad was a high-level Air Force general that got caught smuggling nuclear bomb
[1:15:30.620 --> 1:15:36.500]  fuses illegally but didn't get in trouble so I'm telling him he was attached
[1:15:36.500 --> 1:15:42.820]  to CNN CNN undercover in there leading the attack trying to get people to burn
[1:15:42.820 --> 1:15:47.060]  things down now does that mean there wasn't some of the good old boys that
[1:15:47.060 --> 1:15:50.580]  got pissed off and went in there some of the other folks were just having fun
[1:15:50.580 --> 1:15:54.340]  taking selfies absolutely and a woman got killed a few others had heart attacks
[1:15:54.340 --> 1:15:57.460]  and a cop died later for heart attack and it's wrong we shouldn't act like that
[1:15:57.460 --> 1:16:01.740]  but compared to everything else we've seen now they feign this is the end of
[1:16:01.740 --> 1:16:05.420]  the world yeah there's Anderson Cooper CIA by the way up there were these
[1:16:05.420 --> 1:16:09.140]  folks lying about all the violence they saw and CNN knew damn well that their
[1:16:09.140 --> 1:16:14.620]  reporter was assigned to them to videotape all this and then they're
[1:16:14.620 --> 1:16:18.380]  seeing in knowing he was part of staging the whole deal with him on a few days
[1:16:18.380 --> 1:16:22.500]  after it come out how evil the right wingers were and what he saw so I mean
[1:16:22.500 --> 1:16:25.620]  that's the circles complete right there Larry Pickney is our guest we really
[1:16:25.620 --> 1:16:30.180]  appreciate him or the former founders of the real Black Panther Party not the
[1:16:30.180 --> 1:16:35.300]  modern one continue on then with where this is going what you expect him to do
[1:16:35.300 --> 1:16:39.220]  after stealing this election what you expect Biden to do and and what you
[1:16:39.220 --> 1:16:42.180]  think we ought to do because I'm really worried about them staging events this
[1:16:42.180 --> 1:16:46.620]  weekend and next week and blaming it on us well quite frankly I'm glad you brought
[1:16:46.620 --> 1:16:54.180]  that up because what we can expect all right is that you're going to see or we
[1:16:54.180 --> 1:17:01.380]  are going to see agent provocateurs getting involved directly in various
[1:17:01.380 --> 1:17:09.780]  nefarious actions to again try to discredit Christians conservatives
[1:17:09.780 --> 1:17:16.580]  independence patriots all right that's what don't be surprised because that's
[1:17:16.580 --> 1:17:23.460]  how they work that's what they do it's nothing new to my brothers and sisters of
[1:17:23.460 --> 1:17:27.780]  all colors black white brown red and yellow and especially to the audience of
[1:17:27.780 --> 1:17:33.020]  info wars I send you my love and my strength and I tell you that this is an
[1:17:33.020 --> 1:17:40.460]  ongoing struggle we are dealing with lunatics but they are devious lunatics
[1:17:40.460 --> 1:17:47.980]  if they are you dare to to speak a narrative that they disagree with why
[1:17:47.980 --> 1:17:54.140]  they will do everything they can to silence you and or to discredit you that
[1:17:54.140 --> 1:17:59.300]  we simply should expect that but be prepared for that don't go for the
[1:17:59.300 --> 1:18:04.100]  ghosts as we used to say back in the 60s don't go for the goats now what should
[1:18:04.100 --> 1:18:10.260]  we do we need to hold on tight number one to our own principles all right we
[1:18:10.260 --> 1:18:16.140]  need to understand that we are up against creatures people if you will who
[1:18:16.140 --> 1:18:21.540]  have no principles they are devoid of principles so understand that stop
[1:18:21.540 --> 1:18:27.220]  expecting them to act in a principle faction or fashion all right they don't
[1:18:27.220 --> 1:18:33.900]  do that they're hypocrites they're liars okay their news media is nothing but a
[1:18:33.900 --> 1:18:41.340]  neoliberal fascist arm of propaganda media it's not news it's propaganda by the
[1:18:41.340 --> 1:18:47.100]  way we're showing footage they're now it's out on national news of anti-foot
[1:18:47.100 --> 1:18:50.500]  shooting video themselves admitting they were dressing up like Trump supporters
[1:18:50.500 --> 1:18:55.740]  to go stage the riots I mean we and them inside the Capitol as well I mean
[1:18:55.740 --> 1:19:01.060]  this is just unbelievable well it is in a sense unbelievable but you're right
[1:19:01.060 --> 1:19:04.140]  this is the same thing over and over again it's just unbelievable that they're
[1:19:04.140 --> 1:19:09.700]  so sloppy and they even get caught doing it and they're so arrogant about it
[1:19:09.700 --> 1:19:16.060]  I mean imagine that arrogant they are so confident that they will continue to be
[1:19:16.060 --> 1:19:21.020]  supported by these neoliberal fascist Democrats that they of course are going
[1:19:21.020 --> 1:19:25.700]  to film themselves look at us right by the way Larry what is it because you're
[1:19:25.700 --> 1:19:28.780]  your smart guy I don't know you can look at somebody's eyes and see what's wrong
[1:19:28.780 --> 1:19:33.220]  with them why do these globalist and new order people all look like psycho crazies
[1:19:33.220 --> 1:19:39.660]  and then act like it what's up with the eyes that's a good question I'm looking
[1:19:39.660 --> 1:19:45.500]  at and I've looked at this before it is I consider it this is my humble
[1:19:45.500 --> 1:19:52.220]  opinion I think that they are lunatics I really do I lunatics I think that they
[1:19:52.220 --> 1:19:58.500]  are maniacal and I again I say that's what we're up against and but that's them
[1:19:58.500 --> 1:20:03.940]  that's not us that's them I agree so I didn't mean to interrupt digress continue
[1:20:03.940 --> 1:20:09.860]  on with what you said we should expect well we should expect more setups all
[1:20:09.860 --> 1:20:15.540]  right we should expect more agent provocateur activity just like in the 60s
[1:20:15.540 --> 1:20:22.380]  and 70s only on steroids now we should expect don't be surprised if they we
[1:20:22.380 --> 1:20:28.980]  now hear about later somebody coming up dressed in a make America great again
[1:20:28.980 --> 1:20:36.900]  shirt or hat okay who supposedly tried to commit violence okay don't be surprised
[1:20:36.900 --> 1:20:41.180]  that's what they do people in mage gear saying we hate black people crap like
[1:20:41.180 --> 1:20:45.020]  that they we've caught them over and over again doing that that's correct so
[1:20:45.020 --> 1:20:50.380]  don't be bamboozled as brother Malcolm used to say don't be bamboozled
[1:20:50.380 --> 1:20:56.460]  think for crying out loud think this is still our republic yes they are doing
[1:20:56.460 --> 1:21:00.420]  their utmost to take it from us from we the people let me ask you this question
[1:21:00.420 --> 1:21:03.100]  how do the Democrats Republicans aren't perfect especially back then they've
[1:21:03.100 --> 1:21:06.060]  been a lot of bad ones the Democrats have always been the nasty leaders we know
[1:21:06.060 --> 1:21:09.740]  that I know from the history books that Martin Luther King did not like the
[1:21:09.740 --> 1:21:13.540]  Democrats I know that Malcolm X thought they were the worst of the two groups how
[1:21:13.540 --> 1:21:16.780]  did they suddenly after Martin Luther King and Malcolm X got killed and then
[1:21:16.780 --> 1:21:20.620]  Kennedy teach black people and white people that Democrats are the ones that
[1:21:20.620 --> 1:21:26.340]  are anti-racist and not the other way around isn't that ironic it's really
[1:21:26.340 --> 1:21:31.420]  ironic I was thinking of that today before the show they have programmed
[1:21:31.420 --> 1:21:36.060]  people the first of all what they do is they try they dumb you down with
[1:21:36.060 --> 1:21:40.740]  distractions and with missing did misinformation and disinformation and
[1:21:40.740 --> 1:21:48.100]  this has been going on you know since the 50s 60 70s alright and incessantly
[1:21:48.100 --> 1:21:54.300]  going on alright so now the very party that founded the Ku Klux Klan which by
[1:21:54.300 --> 1:21:59.940]  the way was a Democrat party the very party that founded the clan and and
[1:21:59.940 --> 1:22:05.060]  that's why I mentioned Robert Byrd a former clan leader and recruiter that
[1:22:05.060 --> 1:22:12.180]  very party is now put up as supposedly anti-racist anti-fascist when they are
[1:22:12.180 --> 1:22:17.780]  the racist so wake up people I don't give a damn about your color I love you if
[1:22:17.780 --> 1:22:24.140]  you are a decent patriot republic supporting human being that's what it's
[1:22:24.140 --> 1:22:30.700]  about and and so yes Alex yes you're correct you know we need to understand
[1:22:30.700 --> 1:22:36.820]  what once we understand what and who we're dealing with we have won half the
[1:22:36.820 --> 1:22:40.940]  battle not the whole battle but half the battle all right we're going to break
[1:22:40.940 --> 1:22:43.980]  longer segment coming up Larry you've got so much to cover I've got so many
[1:22:43.980 --> 1:22:46.460]  questions what else is on your radar what do you want to tell us when we come
[1:22:46.460 --> 1:22:53.580]  back I want to talk more about some of their tactics and perhaps what some of
[1:22:53.580 --> 1:22:57.660]  the things that we could and should or might be doing I agree because here's
[1:22:57.660 --> 1:23:00.900]  my thing I don't want to get tricked at anything violent but I also feel like I
[1:23:00.900 --> 1:23:03.940]  should start doing civil disobedience they stole the election I'm not gonna
[1:23:03.940 --> 1:23:06.780]  shut up about that they're censoring everybody and so I'm gonna ask you
[1:23:06.780 --> 1:23:09.700]  because I know you've been to prison for doing nothing wrong for standing as you
[1:23:09.700 --> 1:23:13.700]  were so effective I respect you want to ask you my elder what do you think I
[1:23:13.700 --> 1:23:16.140]  should do because I actually feel guilty that I'm not doing enough people say oh
[1:23:16.140 --> 1:23:19.980]  Alex you know no we need to start doing some civil disobedience I think that's
[1:23:19.980 --> 1:23:23.060]  that's like Muhammad Gandhi or Martin Luther King that's very clear so they
[1:23:23.060 --> 1:23:25.700]  can't spin it we'll come back with Larry Pickney on the other side be sure and
[1:23:25.700 --> 1:23:30.260]  visit his excellent website blackactivistwg.org and the book saying
[1:23:30.260 --> 1:23:33.740]  no to power and and and you got a Twitter too right blackcomiteter.com
[1:23:33.740 --> 1:23:39.420]  what's what's the Twitter Larry well it's reality the word reality underscore
[1:23:39.420 --> 1:23:43.900]  and the number one reality underscores it's a great Twitter we want to ban it
[1:23:43.900 --> 1:23:47.460]  I'm plugging it but we'll talk about when we come back there it is I want to
[1:23:47.460 --> 1:23:51.220]  warn all patriots in the United States and across the world but let's think of
[1:23:51.220 --> 1:23:55.900]  my voice I'm Alex Jones I've been in this fight 27 years I've studied every
[1:23:55.900 --> 1:24:02.060]  angle of their operations and I'm here to tell you as clear as day they have
[1:24:02.060 --> 1:24:07.140]  organizations on message boards and other groups posing as patriot leaders and
[1:24:07.140 --> 1:24:12.300]  posing as president Trump anonymously telling you to have our marches in all
[1:24:12.300 --> 1:24:17.060]  50 states coming up on the 20th and before that you are being set up I was
[1:24:17.060 --> 1:24:21.580]  there in DC with a million peaceful people and I watch Antifa and other
[1:24:21.580 --> 1:24:26.660]  leftist groups poses our people and set us up thank God the Patriots did not
[1:24:26.660 --> 1:24:31.860]  engage in the rioting so only a few people did it so the thing was a misfire
[1:24:31.860 --> 1:24:36.700]  it was a dud but the left is hungry to declare all Trump supporters terrorist
[1:24:36.700 --> 1:24:40.700]  and they're planning terrorist attacks and mass shootings on the 20th to blame
[1:24:40.700 --> 1:24:46.100]  the American people do not be part of it we are peaceful we are not violent
[1:24:46.100 --> 1:24:52.100]  now is the time to get prepared you got to pray to God get your soul ready you
[1:24:52.100 --> 1:24:55.380]  gotta be prepared to physically defend yourself and your family and you've also
[1:24:55.380 --> 1:24:59.740]  got to get things that allow you and your family to not be dependent on the
[1:24:59.740 --> 1:25:03.620]  system that's why they want to bankrupt the economy it's why they want to
[1:25:03.620 --> 1:25:08.020]  destroy the infrastructure of this nation because they want all of us on our
[1:25:08.020 --> 1:25:13.020]  knees so they can dictate our surrender to them info wars is a critical

[1:26:48.580 --> 1:26:54.140]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:26:54.140 --> 1:27:19.380]  you know I get on the show people that I know have been through the ringer we had
[1:27:19.380 --> 1:27:23.660]  Pete Santelion a journalist who covered the Bundy Ranch and covered the
[1:27:23.660 --> 1:27:29.100]  Oregon siege and they set him up multiple life sentences didn't even have guns
[1:27:29.100 --> 1:27:34.580]  but as soon as he refused to plea bargain it all got dropped and he says this is a
[1:27:34.580 --> 1:27:38.220]  false flag it doesn't mean we don't have a right to resist if tyranny's
[1:27:38.220 --> 1:27:41.740]  happening it's that we do it on our time at our place we exhaust every peaceful
[1:27:41.740 --> 1:27:47.380]  means and right now they want to brand all Trump supporters as terrorists they
[1:27:47.380 --> 1:27:51.740]  want to say that if we speak out if we say no to this that we've got to be
[1:27:51.740 --> 1:27:54.860]  censored because we're causing violence so it's important to expose who's really
[1:27:54.860 --> 1:27:58.820]  promoting the violence and to peacefully move forward to expose the crime boss
[1:27:58.820 --> 1:28:02.820]  the Chinese Communist agent Joe Biden but you want to get more into their
[1:28:02.820 --> 1:28:06.140]  tactics Larry Pickney a founding member of the Black Panther Party we can do
[1:28:06.140 --> 1:28:09.420]  five hours on how they set you up it's a famous case books have been written
[1:28:09.420 --> 1:28:13.940]  about it you famously you know did a UN case that nobody else had done I mean
[1:28:13.940 --> 1:28:17.940]  your whole story itself should be a major movie and I'm serious but let's just
[1:28:17.940 --> 1:28:21.420]  say this you've got the bonafides you know you've been there you've done that
[1:28:21.420 --> 1:28:24.540]  you know what you're talking about so what do you think is about to happen
[1:28:24.540 --> 1:28:27.340]  what's your warning what are their tactics and then what should we do
[1:28:27.340 --> 1:28:30.500]  legally and lawfully because I really think that the time is for civil
[1:28:30.500 --> 1:28:34.460]  disobedience they're worried about that so they want to provocateur violence to
[1:28:34.460 --> 1:28:38.900]  discredit us I mean isn't that what they always want to do of course and can you
[1:28:38.900 --> 1:28:44.860]  blame them they are neoliberal fascists that's what they do that's what fascists
[1:28:44.860 --> 1:28:52.420]  do and you know whatever cloak they wear we know is a cloak so of course they
[1:28:52.420 --> 1:28:59.220]  are going to proceed to use agent provocateurs and try to discredit us but
[1:28:59.220 --> 1:29:04.660]  I keep saying this with all due respect my dear brother you know expect this
[1:29:04.660 --> 1:29:12.020]  expected it's not about our resisting on their terms it's about our resisting on
[1:29:12.020 --> 1:29:19.700]  our terms and let me distinguish what I mean do not engage in quote unquote
[1:29:19.700 --> 1:29:26.660]  violence you have the right to defend yourself but do not engage in violence
[1:29:26.660 --> 1:29:32.260]  that's what they want you to do and even if you don't do it you saw how they set
[1:29:32.260 --> 1:29:38.020]  people up how Antifa clantifa just a few days ago in the capital set people up
[1:29:38.020 --> 1:29:43.460]  they're gonna say we did it anyway but don't do it all right now what should we
[1:29:43.460 --> 1:29:49.620]  do let's first of all I mean and this is not something that Alex asked me to say
[1:29:49.620 --> 1:29:56.420]  first of all support info wars support the the Patriots support the resistance
[1:29:56.420 --> 1:30:03.180]  and pass that information on now more than ever before there's a need to hold
[1:30:03.180 --> 1:30:08.900]  on tight to each other and any differences that we might have because we
[1:30:08.900 --> 1:30:15.140]  are human and we will have differences let's have them in the closet as brother
[1:30:15.140 --> 1:30:22.100]  Malcolm X used to say but we must stay as a united front as a matter of fact I
[1:30:22.100 --> 1:30:27.220]  think we're going to get a lot stronger because some of the tactics that are
[1:30:27.220 --> 1:30:32.780]  being used like that insane Nancy Pelosi and her colleagues like Maxine
[1:30:32.780 --> 1:30:38.180]  Waters of quote-unquote impeaching the president all that has done actually is
[1:30:38.180 --> 1:30:46.740]  really made people see how maniacal they are they meaning the neo liberal fascist
[1:30:46.740 --> 1:30:52.980]  Democrats and I use that expression deliberately neo liberal fascist
[1:30:52.980 --> 1:30:58.460]  Democrats it's like when I'm dealing or talking about dealing with discussing
[1:30:58.460 --> 1:31:07.020]  Antifa I say what it is it's Antifa slash clan Tifa that's what it is so let's
[1:31:07.020 --> 1:31:14.260]  remember our history they want us to forget about James T. Hodgkinson they
[1:31:14.260 --> 1:31:20.660]  want us to forget what this man did they want us to forget the multiple people
[1:31:20.660 --> 1:31:27.660]  that he shot okay we must remember that and and you know I believe that the
[1:31:27.660 --> 1:31:33.500]  family now is of families be they black white brown red yellow but American
[1:31:33.500 --> 1:31:38.860]  citizens families are going to become stronger than they ever expected you know
[1:31:38.860 --> 1:31:44.860]  the CIA has a term that it uses and by the way it was the CIA who came up with
[1:31:44.860 --> 1:31:49.700]  the term conspiracy theory that came from the CIA just think about that all
[1:31:49.700 --> 1:31:56.380]  right but the CIA has another term called blowback blowback is simply means in
[1:31:56.380 --> 1:32:01.540]  late layperson's terms that when you engage in an action meaning the CIA
[1:32:01.540 --> 1:32:05.780]  engages in an action like overthrowing a government setting people up blah blah
[1:32:05.780 --> 1:32:13.220]  blah there's always going to be blowback and they cannot I repeat they the deep
[1:32:13.220 --> 1:32:20.220]  state Democrats and their despicable nefarious allies cannot control blowback
[1:32:20.220 --> 1:32:26.060]  so let's you know don't don't be getting down on your knees and saying oh it's
[1:32:26.060 --> 1:32:31.220]  over it's not over are you kidding let me hold you in the next segment I wasn't
[1:32:31.220 --> 1:32:34.700]  there a special report but we need to keep talking because here's the deal we
[1:32:34.700 --> 1:32:38.780]  all have differences people do things people acting gangs races blacks do
[1:32:38.780 --> 1:32:41.500]  stuff races whites do stuff it's always white versus black what about the other
[1:32:41.500 --> 1:32:45.860]  groups humans are humans we have problems but globalism is about bankrupting
[1:32:45.860 --> 1:32:50.780]  it's all they want all our businesses shut down if we're small and that unifies
[1:32:50.780 --> 1:32:53.500]  me more than ever when the globalists have articles about a post human world
[1:32:53.500 --> 1:32:57.460]  and machines are taken over we need to rally together and that's where our real
[1:32:57.460 --> 1:33:01.460]  power is is rallying together for the love of each other and for a future
[1:33:01.460 --> 1:33:06.220]  that's what we need and that will I believe I in my gut my spirit you're
[1:33:06.220 --> 1:33:09.980]  right brother pinkie I know this biggest salt we're about to go through is
[1:33:09.980 --> 1:33:14.020]  gonna bring us together like never before that's right absolutely correct
[1:33:14.020 --> 1:33:18.460]  and this is what they do not understand this is what the because of their
[1:33:18.460 --> 1:33:22.260]  arrogance you see they're arrogant what is it about these these Satanists that's
[1:33:22.260 --> 1:33:26.980]  what I call in this cult they're blinded by arrogance they're so arrogant yes
[1:33:26.980 --> 1:33:33.060]  well they're smug self-righteous neoliberal fascists they are smug
[1:33:33.060 --> 1:33:39.300]  self-righteous neoliberal fascists so you know this is what we need to understand
[1:33:39.300 --> 1:33:44.180]  if we know what we're dealing with then we know better how to effectively deal
[1:33:44.180 --> 1:33:48.100]  with it so how do we deal with them is there even any point trying to wake
[1:33:48.100 --> 1:33:51.700]  one of these people up or just move on or I mean what are other solutions well
[1:33:51.700 --> 1:33:58.820]  each to their own but I for myself I will not try to wake them up all right
[1:33:58.820 --> 1:34:05.220]  if after all these years and after all this time they have not seen how
[1:34:05.220 --> 1:34:12.180]  dastardly okay you know the the the people that they support are if they
[1:34:12.180 --> 1:34:16.620]  haven't seen that well all I can say is and they say in French or French say
[1:34:16.620 --> 1:34:25.900]  la vie say la vie so right and but we we patriots Christians conservatives
[1:34:25.900 --> 1:34:31.220]  independence we must come to not we're already together but we must get even
[1:34:31.220 --> 1:34:36.780]  closer protect each other in every way we can and when I again I don't want
[1:34:36.780 --> 1:34:41.220]  anybody trying to say oh pick me said to pick up the gun I didn't say to pick up
[1:34:41.220 --> 1:34:48.460]  the gun I said protect yourself both psychologically socially and if necessary
[1:34:48.460 --> 1:34:53.020]  physically we need to not feel like losers we've taken on the big corrupt
[1:34:53.020 --> 1:34:56.820]  system it's had to throw all this stuff in humanity because it's losing and I
[1:34:56.820 --> 1:35:00.060]  read their own internal reports at leak out they say they're losing so they're
[1:35:00.060 --> 1:35:03.620]  doing all this desperate stuff just hoping it works and their own people
[1:35:03.620 --> 1:35:06.620]  don't like it they had all that you in footage leak where they're like we don't
[1:35:06.620 --> 1:35:10.020]  want to give vaccines we're hurting people this is tainted that's their head
[1:35:10.020 --> 1:35:15.740]  scientist I mean so they're not as good a shape as they look like that's a façade
[1:35:15.740 --> 1:35:21.660]  well of course it's a facade and they they control the the so-called media
[1:35:21.660 --> 1:35:26.220]  which I call propaganda machine and if you doubt it just think about it they
[1:35:26.220 --> 1:35:31.660]  control the so-called mainstream media and I say so-called because it's really
[1:35:31.660 --> 1:35:36.980]  not a media at all other than it's a medium but it's not the media and you
[1:35:36.980 --> 1:35:40.340]  know we have that's another thing I'm glad you mentioned my brother Alex
[1:35:40.340 --> 1:35:48.660]  because we need to support our media real media such as info wars we need to
[1:35:48.660 --> 1:35:53.620]  be creative about this struggle and we all have to be creative I agree not just
[1:35:53.620 --> 1:35:56.700]  Larry pink near Alex Jones effect again give us your Twitter again as people
[1:35:56.700 --> 1:36:00.660]  need to follow you I wish you do more videos every day you're always so spot
[1:36:00.660 --> 1:36:04.660]  on about every subject if you cut videos even you know low-tech just quick five
[1:36:04.660 --> 1:36:07.460]  minute video and send it to us we'd air it every day Larry how do people follow
[1:36:07.460 --> 1:36:13.300]  you they follow you at reality underscore one that's right reality underscore
[1:36:13.300 --> 1:36:18.540]  one and you know the main thing is I believe ultimately in the power of the
[1:36:18.540 --> 1:36:23.340]  people I really do ultimately in the power of the people stay there and I
[1:36:23.340 --> 1:36:26.300]  think that was Trump's big crime he really believed in people he had
[1:36:26.300 --> 1:36:31.100]  optimism he I know he's very he's not giving up he's very upset that he thought
[1:36:31.100 --> 1:36:34.580]  we could be them easier but no it's not gonna be that easy but I agree with you
[1:36:34.580 --> 1:36:37.620]  their persecution of Trump's gonna blow up in their face even bigger very
[1:36:37.620 --> 1:36:42.460]  picnic final segment straight ahead then we got the guy coming on here had been
[1:36:42.460 --> 1:36:47.300]  on over a year we got him coming on I'll tell you about it coming up due to the
[1:36:47.300 --> 1:36:51.420]  COVID lockdown destroying the supply chain many of the best-selling products
[1:36:51.420 --> 1:36:55.300]  info wars are no longer available and I thought that pollen block might be gone
[1:36:55.300 --> 1:36:59.980]  forever but after eight months we got about 25% of the order we put in
[1:36:59.980 --> 1:37:04.220]  delivered to us the rest they hope in a few months comes in it's my proprietary

[1:44:20.060 --> 1:44:25.740]  saying small businesses are not essential saying that big box stores are big
[1:44:25.740 --> 1:44:30.940]  techs doubled its profits big banks and then Klaus Schwab literally a Nazi I mean
[1:44:30.940 --> 1:44:35.580]  about Nazis literally run by Junker the heir to the Nazi fortune that owns
[1:44:35.580 --> 1:44:40.020]  Luxembourg basically owns what's left of Europe that they're above Prince Charles
[1:44:40.020 --> 1:44:43.540]  and all these people there because I know they are researched them these are
[1:44:43.540 --> 1:44:46.740]  like super villains I'm not just saying they're Nazis to call them that they're
[1:44:46.740 --> 1:44:50.900]  literally calling Trump a Nazi when he's fighting them and these are literal
[1:44:50.900 --> 1:44:54.620]  grandchildren and children of top and I mean the Junkers ran Hitler they were the
[1:44:54.620 --> 1:44:59.180]  top that it's royalty it's the Austrian-Hungarian royalty they are
[1:44:59.180 --> 1:45:03.140]  literally bragging that they're running all of the lockdowns right now and all
[1:45:03.140 --> 1:45:08.220]  of us should unify against this crap Larry yes absolutely and by the way you
[1:45:08.220 --> 1:45:15.300]  mentioned Junkers if anybody happens to be an enthusiast of aircraft such as I
[1:45:15.300 --> 1:45:21.420]  am look it up the Junkers what the bombers okay the the fighters and bombers
[1:45:21.420 --> 1:45:25.380]  meeting aircraft they were the biggest munitions exactly yeah they got no
[1:45:25.380 --> 1:45:31.340]  trouble in so you know your history younger Junker Junker bombers it was
[1:45:31.340 --> 1:45:37.700]  the main German bomber mm-hmm and so when you say things Alex my dear brother I
[1:45:37.700 --> 1:45:41.380]  know that there are people out there that shake their head and say oh it
[1:45:41.380 --> 1:45:47.380]  couldn't be true he's over the line that's top of the line well you know what
[1:45:47.380 --> 1:45:53.740]  they're playing right into what people like gerbils of the third right said the
[1:45:53.740 --> 1:46:01.100]  bigger the lie okay the bigger they tell their lie and they keep pushing it then
[1:46:01.100 --> 1:46:07.620]  you'll believe it but here are people like Alex myself Owen Darren you know
[1:46:07.620 --> 1:46:14.580]  we're telling you the truth and we're asking you to do your own research okay
[1:46:14.580 --> 1:46:21.460]  yep Ju 87 of which I have a model it was a dive bomber and fighter but anyway
[1:46:21.460 --> 1:46:28.300]  yeah that's the famous dive bomber that made that horrible noise yeah
[1:46:28.300 --> 1:46:36.620]  stuka and yeah the Ju 87 stuka Junkers okay but anyway so you're a historian and
[1:46:36.620 --> 1:46:39.900]  I'm into that too like we're not bs-ing and people like what have you ever
[1:46:39.900 --> 1:46:42.100]  noticed when you're in formula because I know you're really informed a lot of
[1:46:42.100 --> 1:46:45.300]  stuff people think you're BS and like you're showing off they don't get like
[1:46:45.300 --> 1:46:49.300]  we want to share the knowledge we're not trying to monopolize it here right
[1:46:49.300 --> 1:46:53.740]  and that's the point they're not used to that they're used to just the opposite
[1:46:53.740 --> 1:47:01.140]  people monopolizing the knowledge and dispensing disinformation and misinformation
[1:47:01.140 --> 1:47:05.820]  whereas we are saying here's some information that you can check for
[1:47:05.820 --> 1:47:12.260]  yourself this is my position check it out see if it's true see if it's accurate
[1:47:12.260 --> 1:47:17.380]  all right then decide what you want to do so yeah it's you know we're kindred
[1:47:17.380 --> 1:47:22.660]  kindred spirits my brother we are kindred spirits it's just crazy though
[1:47:22.660 --> 1:47:26.100]  that they couldn't beat us in World War two so now they bomb us with fear and
[1:47:26.100 --> 1:47:30.140]  these lockdowns but China is totally open for business laughing at us saying
[1:47:30.140 --> 1:47:34.660]  America will never reopen haha telling foreign investors to come there this is
[1:47:34.660 --> 1:47:37.820]  and the left is rejoicing Trump's going what are they going to do with the
[1:47:37.820 --> 1:47:42.820]  economy totally shuts down under Biden I don't know if I did and don't get me
[1:47:42.820 --> 1:47:47.740]  wrong I am a big supporter and have been for years of President Trump however I
[1:47:47.740 --> 1:47:54.780]  don't know if president Trump really understood the devilish and I'm using
[1:47:54.780 --> 1:48:02.620]  yet no idea how bad it was right so I mean but we the people we get it if we
[1:48:02.620 --> 1:48:07.340]  don't get it we should get it by now and let's understand something think
[1:48:07.340 --> 1:48:11.460]  folks don't you think it's kind of strange you turn on your TV set or your
[1:48:11.460 --> 1:48:16.020]  radio or blah blah blah and they're talking about pandemic this pandemic
[1:48:16.020 --> 1:48:23.060]  that but somehow they never mentioned the Chinese Communist Party they never
[1:48:23.060 --> 1:48:31.780]  mentioned Wuhan they never mentioned who gave the world not just our nation our
[1:48:31.780 --> 1:48:37.140]  Republic but who gave the world this virus come on that should tell us
[1:48:37.140 --> 1:48:42.780]  something let's at least think as critical thinker what about three million
[1:48:42.780 --> 1:48:46.420]  peaceful Muslims and camps a million Christians and modus and apples the main
[1:48:46.420 --> 1:48:50.780]  contractor I mean my god it I'm not a violent person but if there was a place
[1:48:50.780 --> 1:48:54.340]  we should burn down I'm not saying do it it would be it would be Tim Cook and I
[1:48:54.340 --> 1:48:58.300]  might say do that but I mean he literally runs death camps he's as crazy as you get
[1:48:58.300 --> 1:49:03.340]  to a real Nazi but he's all liberal so it's okay well actually the that's why
[1:49:03.340 --> 1:49:07.820]  I call them neoliberal fascists because the neoliberal fascists are actually far
[1:49:07.820 --> 1:49:12.740]  worse than the Nazis ever could have been all right if had the Nazis succeeded
[1:49:12.740 --> 1:49:18.060]  and in a sense they they did with these neoliberal fascist so-called Democrats
[1:49:18.060 --> 1:49:23.780]  all right but that's why I keep using the expression that they are neoliberal
[1:49:23.780 --> 1:49:29.620]  fascist Democrats and they are in league with the globalist of course including
[1:49:29.620 --> 1:49:35.620]  the Chinese Communist Party and that's not an exaggeration that's reality so I
[1:49:35.620 --> 1:49:43.340]  I implore all of my brothers and sisters of all colors study research know who
[1:49:43.340 --> 1:49:48.700]  you're up against who we're up against but most of all come together you know
[1:49:48.700 --> 1:49:54.420]  as we used to say back in the day we use a Swahili term from East Africa we would
[1:49:54.420 --> 1:49:59.940]  say La Sima Tushende in Villa Chaka and that simply means all it means is we
[1:49:59.940 --> 1:50:06.100]  shall succeed without a doubt but we will only succeed my brothers and sisters
[1:50:06.100 --> 1:50:13.180]  the only way we will succeed is to gird our hips not to be fair weather
[1:50:13.180 --> 1:50:18.020]  Patriots but admit what we're up against the only shot we got we're gonna win
[1:50:18.020 --> 1:50:23.740]  say that in Swahili again I love the way that sounds La Sima Tushende in Villa
[1:50:23.740 --> 1:50:29.660]  Chaka we shall succeed without a doubt we don't have a choice but I agree with
[1:50:29.660 --> 1:50:34.340]  you we're not being optimistic those of us that fight will succeed for future
[1:50:34.340 --> 1:50:37.380]  generations regardless and I think the enemy's on the ropes all right Larry

[1:52:37.980 --> 1:52:42.180]  perfect dichotomy of psychological warfare the United Nations the big
[1:52:42.180 --> 1:52:46.060]  corporations the globalist big tech and big farmer all pushing the covers the
[1:52:46.060 --> 1:52:49.980]  most deadly thing in history even though statistically it's a very weak flu or
[1:52:49.980 --> 1:52:54.060]  cold but if you are deficient then you can actually die from it that's why
[1:52:54.060 --> 1:52:58.020]  you see somebody dying inside the nursing homes meanwhile all these top
[1:52:58.020 --> 1:53:02.060]  scientists and researchers and former Pfizer head medical officers have come
[1:53:02.060 --> 1:53:06.740]  and said that the COVID-19 vaccine especially mRNA ones are basically
[1:53:06.740 --> 1:53:09.940]  bioweapons that are super deadly and now they're having to resuscitate people
[1:53:09.940 --> 1:53:13.940]  that die basically when they take it just like newborn babies they give
[1:53:13.940 --> 1:53:16.860]  vaccines they have to resuscitate them all the time or a lot of times they just
[1:53:16.860 --> 1:53:19.740]  like die and that's on the record it does that
[1:53:19.740 --> 1:53:24.020]  Guillain-Marais, narcolepsy, cancer all these other diseases but they tell you
[1:53:24.020 --> 1:53:27.060]  safe and effective no one's getting hurt it's a conspiracy theory and then all
[1:53:27.060 --> 1:53:30.860]  the fine princess can kill you absolutely deadly so they run from
[1:53:30.860 --> 1:53:33.740]  something that isn't dangerous towards something that is incredibly dangerous
[1:53:33.740 --> 1:53:37.740]  because the media says it's safe they do it
[1:53:39.140 --> 1:53:44.580]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:53:54.860 --> 1:54:00.220]  the Democrats are acting as if we were under an alien invasion but it wasn't
[1:54:00.220 --> 1:54:04.740]  an invasion from the Pleiades it's merely their constituents who have had
[1:54:04.740 --> 1:54:09.140]  enough of their rights being stripped the corruption that's been on parade the
[1:54:09.140 --> 1:54:13.860]  blind eye to the destruction of our country by their supporters and our vote
[1:54:13.860 --> 1:54:18.100]  being compromised President Trump has held over 600 rallies in the last four
[1:54:18.100 --> 1:54:23.620]  years none of them included assaulting police destroying businesses or burning
[1:54:23.620 --> 1:54:29.780]  down cities Democrats have spent all this time endorsing and enabling violent
[1:54:29.780 --> 1:54:36.020]  riots that left billions in property damage and 47 dead across the United
[1:54:36.020 --> 1:54:41.420]  States Democrats are on record supporting violence when it serves their
[1:54:41.420 --> 1:54:48.300]  cause in their own words on social media on interviews and on fundraising
[1:54:48.300 --> 1:54:56.180]  platforms act blue so Democrats can say quote I just don't even know why there
[1:54:56.180 --> 1:55:01.020]  aren't uprisings all over the country while there are uprisings happening
[1:55:01.020 --> 1:55:05.700]  around the country but they impeach the president of the United States for
[1:55:05.700 --> 1:55:10.700]  saying peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard Democrats can say you
[1:55:10.700 --> 1:55:13.580]  know there needs to be unrest in the streets for as long as there is unrest
[1:55:13.580 --> 1:55:17.820]  in our lives and unfortunately there's plenty to go around quote you know
[1:55:17.820 --> 1:55:23.700]  there needs to be unrest in the streets while there is unrest in the streets but
[1:55:23.700 --> 1:55:27.580]  they're gonna impeach the president for saying peacefully and patriotically make
[1:55:27.580 --> 1:55:32.980]  your voices heard make no mistake here the hypocrisy of the left is on full
[1:55:32.980 --> 1:55:37.980]  display quote go to the hill get in the face of some Congress people we've got
[1:55:37.980 --> 1:55:43.300]  to fight in Congress fight in the courts fight in the streets take him behind the
[1:55:43.300 --> 1:55:49.620]  gym and beat the hell out of him take him go and take Trump out tonight sound
[1:55:49.620 --> 1:55:53.340]  familiar let me give you one bottom line as former government official
[1:55:53.340 --> 1:55:58.500]  government's gonna kill this guy burning cars and smashed windows a small
[1:55:58.500 --> 1:56:02.980]  group of protesters dressed in black their faces covered armed with hammers
[1:56:02.980 --> 1:56:09.780]  and bricks facing off with thousands of officers on site many in riot gear
[1:56:09.780 --> 1:56:14.900]  confronting them with flashbang grenades and pepper spray before the
[1:56:14.900 --> 1:56:19.020]  swearing in ceremony even began protesters tried to block checkpoint
[1:56:19.020 --> 1:56:24.340]  entrances during president Trump's speech several demonstrators were escorted
[1:56:24.340 --> 1:56:29.020]  out of the area several officers injured during the protest today and more
[1:56:29.020 --> 1:56:33.220]  than a hundred people arrested instead of throwing a blanket of calm and
[1:56:33.220 --> 1:56:37.100]  unification over the raging fire of frustration the corporate cratic
[1:56:37.100 --> 1:56:41.940]  country club responds with gasoline after the attack on our capital I hope that
[1:56:41.940 --> 1:56:45.500]  Congress can finally come together to do something to address this threat
[1:56:45.500 --> 1:56:49.420]  senator dick Durbin's domestic terrorism prevention act would establish
[1:56:49.420 --> 1:56:54.340]  offices at the DOJ the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security to
[1:56:54.340 --> 1:56:59.220]  prevent future attacks like the one this week at the US Capitol it would
[1:56:59.220 --> 1:57:03.700]  require these offices to regularly assess domestic terrorism threat this man
[1:57:03.700 --> 1:57:09.340]  is dangerous he has defied the Constitution he's incited sedition and
[1:57:09.340 --> 1:57:15.220]  he must be removed if we fail to remove a white supremacist president who
[1:57:15.220 --> 1:57:19.260]  incited a white supremacist insurrection it's communities like Missouri's first
[1:57:19.260 --> 1:57:23.820]  district that suffer the most the 117th Congress must understand that we have a
[1:57:23.820 --> 1:57:28.700]  mandate to legislate in defense of black lives the first step in that process is
[1:57:28.700 --> 1:57:33.700]  to root out white supremacy starting with impeaching the white supremacist in
[1:57:33.700 --> 1:57:38.900]  chief thank you and I yield back amongst themselves the left foments a
[1:57:38.900 --> 1:57:44.380]  dangerous communistic narrative deeming all conservatives as subhuman trash as
[1:57:44.380 --> 1:57:49.300]  the Palmer report tweeted conservatives cannot be teachers police
[1:57:49.300 --> 1:57:54.460]  officers doctors lawyers coaches or bosses it's constitutionally unfair to
[1:57:54.460 --> 1:57:58.340]  others who are subjected to the conservatives deranged judgment
[1:57:58.340 --> 1:58:03.060]  conservatives can do menial work until they are ready to join the human race
[1:58:03.060 --> 1:58:07.900]  Palmer is essentially calling for the very same Chinese style reeducation
[1:58:07.900 --> 1:58:12.940]  labor camps that former PBS counsel Michael Beller was arrogantly bragging
[1:58:12.940 --> 1:58:18.660]  about in a project veritas investigation

[2:00:04.860 --> 2:00:14.020]  optimism and a esoteric cult of non-transparency Steve Quayle I would
[2:00:14.020 --> 2:00:18.260]  call the anti-optimist and the realist I'm not attacking Q I'm just saying you
[2:00:18.260 --> 2:00:21.340]  know trust the plan Trump's invincible that's what brought us to this point I
[2:00:21.340 --> 2:00:24.780]  think Q put the enemy over the top on this that's okay we'll regroup and move
[2:00:24.780 --> 2:00:27.420]  forward Biden will be their worst nightmare they want to play a Machiavellian
[2:00:27.420 --> 2:00:32.100]  game but Steve Quayle is a best-selling author filmmaker researcher survivalist
[2:00:32.100 --> 2:00:36.180]  I mean he'd been around a long time when I first got on air 27 years I'd get him
[2:00:36.180 --> 2:00:40.020]  on he'd be like they have human animal clones pigs and human clones in China
[2:00:40.020 --> 2:00:45.220]  years later it came out and so he talked about splicing our genetics and
[2:00:45.220 --> 2:00:50.860]  forced inoculations to change our DNA he predicted it all the GMO crops
[2:00:50.860 --> 2:00:54.260]  everything and so I've been trying to get him on for like a year I guess he's
[2:00:54.260 --> 2:00:56.820]  been out of the country or somewhere else but maybe next week we'll join us
[2:00:56.820 --> 2:00:59.700]  again because I love Steve Quayle and you know I used to think that he was a
[2:00:59.700 --> 2:01:04.140]  little over the top and now I think my gosh he's so accurate and so he joins
[2:01:04.140 --> 2:01:08.740]  the Steve Quayle calm Jen six giants comms a lot of discovery channel history
[2:01:08.740 --> 2:01:13.060]  channel you name it shows so he's very well-known fellow but here's the actual
[2:01:13.060 --> 2:01:18.780]  man behind it all and here we are with him Steve where to start what would you
[2:01:18.780 --> 2:01:23.420]  call what's happening a communist takeover a globalist takeover I mean it's
[2:01:23.420 --> 2:01:27.860]  all here everything we ever said like in triplicate there's no more denial now so
[2:01:27.860 --> 2:01:32.260]  what do you call this point we've reached well we're at the point Alex that
[2:01:32.260 --> 2:01:36.740]  this is a full-scale communist revolution to overthrow the United States of
[2:01:36.740 --> 2:01:42.540]  America we're in the position right now of seeing and watching the greatest
[2:01:42.540 --> 2:01:47.500]  attack on a sitting president ever undertaken solid linsky's rules for
[2:01:47.500 --> 2:01:52.300]  radicals the rules of the radicals have brought us to this point where our
[2:01:52.300 --> 2:01:56.860]  nation is literally hanging the balance of whether we will exist or not now
[2:01:56.860 --> 2:02:02.580]  from the beginning of president Trump's presidency the narrative has to has been
[2:02:02.580 --> 2:02:08.780]  to spoil him accuse him of everything keep him pretty much segregated from
[2:02:08.780 --> 2:02:15.020]  being able to replace the alligators that so our president he's been under
[2:02:15.020 --> 2:02:20.540]  total siege total siege and here's the thing ladies gentlemen this isn't a
[2:02:20.540 --> 2:02:26.140]  spontaneous uprising and I get so sick and tired of people that are saying this
[2:02:26.140 --> 2:02:31.060]  was a white supremacist white supremacist drop the supremacist this is an
[2:02:31.060 --> 2:02:37.900]  attitude that is absolutely permeating everybody's everything our country but
[2:02:37.900 --> 2:02:42.380]  might have just say our borders language culture and now we've watched every bit
[2:02:42.380 --> 2:02:46.580]  of our heritage be erased there are people saying that if you are a a
[2:02:46.580 --> 2:02:52.020]  constitutional I people that are Christians and you have children the
[2:02:52.020 --> 2:02:56.660]  state must take them away and Alex this is the bottom line these are the days
[2:02:56.660 --> 2:03:02.100]  that after a quarter of a century of warning about everything is in place to
[2:03:02.100 --> 2:03:07.140]  see ladies and gentlemen Donald Trump was hit with the whole Russian hoax in
[2:03:07.140 --> 2:03:11.940]  order to take the heat off of the traders in Congress in the Senate that are
[2:03:11.940 --> 2:03:17.100]  under Chinese financial control and we now know the CCP advised Swallows well
[2:03:17.100 --> 2:03:23.540]  who did the impeachment yesterday on record Chinese agent he was advised by
[2:03:23.540 --> 2:03:26.940]  the CCP to make it all about Russia what was I mean we are literally going
[2:03:26.940 --> 2:03:32.820]  under Chi-com control we are and even as I'm on the you know the podcast with you
[2:03:32.820 --> 2:03:36.940]  today broadcast forgive me the bottom line is as ladies gentlemen I'm getting
[2:03:36.940 --> 2:03:43.340]  reports 24-7 as Alex does as others do but we literally ladies and gentlemen
[2:03:43.340 --> 2:03:48.420]  are being surrounded whether it's the Chinese and the Caribbean the Chinese
[2:03:48.420 --> 2:03:52.580]  of Mexico the Chinese and Canada which is true now we have you said that years
[2:03:52.580 --> 2:03:56.300]  ago it's not and the Prime Minister says I want to be a dictator like G.C.
[2:03:56.300 --> 2:04:00.980]  Pink let me just stop you we get into it all how did you foresee all of this
[2:04:00.980 --> 2:04:04.340]  because I'm not kissing your butt it's true when I first read your books 27
[2:04:04.340 --> 2:04:07.340]  years ago I thought well this is interesting with this is over the top
[2:04:07.340 --> 2:04:13.260]  now it all came true how the hell did you know all this well quite candidly and
[2:04:13.260 --> 2:04:17.460]  I my testimony is simply this I went from the gunner most the other most I was a
[2:04:17.460 --> 2:04:22.180]  present attorney this is important that was wild on Montana State University I
[2:04:22.180 --> 2:04:25.820]  went to how Lindsay talking about Jesus never knew about Jesus never knew
[2:04:25.820 --> 2:04:30.100]  anything and I accepted Jesus my heart I went home that night I was living in my
[2:04:30.100 --> 2:04:35.980]  mother's house and 10 10 blocks from the university and Jesus literally and I
[2:04:35.980 --> 2:04:40.060]  know this gonna flit flip people out but he literally appeared to me I fell on
[2:04:40.060 --> 2:04:44.500]  my face he gave me a panorama of history and told me he was calling me now
[2:04:44.500 --> 2:04:49.220]  understand I just found out who Jesus was the day that that spirit of God
[2:04:49.220 --> 2:04:53.900]  convicted my heart but here's the thing he gave me a panorama of history I saw
[2:04:53.900 --> 2:04:57.300]  it in the future was just imagine a motion picture and then he gave me a
[2:04:57.300 --> 2:05:03.100]  statement he says Steve I am going to hide the things from you until they're
[2:05:03.100 --> 2:05:08.180]  shortly to come to pass and he told me he said I want you to prepare my people
[2:05:08.180 --> 2:05:12.740]  for the end of the age I'll bring people that know to tell you what you need to
[2:05:12.740 --> 2:05:16.980]  know but you must be faithful to warn them Alex that's true from that and that
[2:05:16.980 --> 2:05:21.620]  launched me into this study of ancient history you got a visit from Jesus I
[2:05:21.620 --> 2:05:25.060]  got a visit from the other guy so why'd you get a visit from the Jesus I got a
[2:05:25.060 --> 2:05:29.940]  visit from the devil because I was serving the devil wholehearted and
[2:05:29.940 --> 2:05:35.140]  somebody somewhere touched God for me because I was totally
[2:05:35.140 --> 2:05:39.820]  so why did I get a visit from the devil which I'm gonna get into an air but I
[2:05:39.820 --> 2:05:43.420]  got the other visit because I was pretty I love God actually but I got a visit
[2:05:43.420 --> 2:05:48.420]  from the other guy but listen you only get a visit from the devil even Jesus
[2:05:48.420 --> 2:05:53.140]  was tempted by the devil I'm not saying either one of us are Jesus but I think
[2:05:53.140 --> 2:05:57.340]  it's really important Alex that people understand something this is a spiritual
[2:05:57.340 --> 2:06:03.060]  war that's why Republicans are in my opinion that's why conservatives and
[2:06:03.060 --> 2:06:07.180]  more importantly Christians it should flip everybody out that the plan is to
[2:06:07.180 --> 2:06:11.980]  annihilate to destroy every Christian in America you always said that forced
[2:06:11.980 --> 2:06:15.620]  inoculations death now they're reporting just death everywhere I was with a
[2:06:15.620 --> 2:06:19.340]  medical doctor this morning fixing my tooth he said everyone I know is super
[2:06:19.340 --> 2:06:24.420]  sick that took it I'm not taking it I mean it's like it's just incredible it
[2:06:24.420 --> 2:06:29.900]  is and again the vaccine you know it was on your show that years ago when the
[2:06:29.900 --> 2:06:34.500]  Ebola scare was I came up with a statement shot me arm shot in the head
[2:06:34.500 --> 2:06:40.540]  either way they want you dead and unfortunately I think that the president
[2:06:40.540 --> 2:06:45.460]  the sitting president president Trump did not have an appreciation for
[2:06:45.460 --> 2:06:51.860]  scientific let's say discussion based on fact I'm on record Alex is saying that
[2:06:51.860 --> 2:06:56.100]  the mask of the beast leads to the mark of the beast leads to the murder of the
[2:06:56.100 --> 2:07:00.340]  beast we are being socially isolated obviously everyone who's cut off from my
[2:07:00.340 --> 2:07:05.340]  you know all of the faces of death book what I called Facebook faces of death
[2:07:05.340 --> 2:07:10.220]  book it was because I knew it was a self-directing intelligence doc you were
[2:07:10.220 --> 2:07:13.860]  saying that like six years ago before it turned bad that's what I'm saying you
[2:07:13.860 --> 2:07:17.860]  have been way out of your time and I get it you're saying God even held back the
[2:07:17.860 --> 2:07:20.820]  knowledge because if you've been saying it even before it would have sounded even
[2:07:20.820 --> 2:07:26.740]  crazier right and let me explain it to people there's only a context of time
[2:07:26.740 --> 2:07:32.020]  where you have to be ready to hear the truth because when you're being
[2:07:32.020 --> 2:07:36.700]  manipulated by the mainstream media and by the way I'm on record is calling the
[2:07:36.700 --> 2:07:41.260]  mainstream murderers when you understand who controls them the
[2:07:41.260 --> 2:07:45.940]  Luciferians at the core of everything everybody you see on earth is basically a
[2:07:45.940 --> 2:07:51.780]  hand puppet okay and the devil gets his fingers into every single politician's
[2:07:51.780 --> 2:07:56.060]  life who sell out to him not all politicians and notice how ugly and
[2:07:56.060 --> 2:07:59.660]  unanimated they are I don't mean they're old I mean they look like they've been
[2:07:59.660 --> 2:08:04.100]  sucked dry all these Pelosi Schumer you can see they have no power there there's
[2:08:04.100 --> 2:08:08.940]  nothing there if you look at their eyes the Bible says that the eyes are
[2:08:08.940 --> 2:08:14.260]  windows to the soul and I'm gonna make this statement you get blamed for a lot
[2:08:14.260 --> 2:08:18.100]  of stuff I get blamed for a lot of stuff but when you look at all of these look
[2:08:18.100 --> 2:08:23.900]  specifically at AOC if the windows eyes are windows to the soul what do you see
[2:08:23.900 --> 2:08:29.140]  there you and that's a rather this evil predator totally out to get like maniac
[2:08:29.140 --> 2:08:33.620]  or what would you say I think yeah and I would say this I would say you're now
[2:08:33.620 --> 2:08:38.780]  and I bet you weren't before but you're coming to the obvious conclusion that
[2:08:38.780 --> 2:08:43.500]  America has to come to this is a spiritual warfare this is a spiritual
[2:08:43.500 --> 2:08:47.900]  demonic invasion these are not humans these are been jacked into I would call
[2:08:47.900 --> 2:08:52.140]  these I would call them entities when I use the term entity Alex it means
[2:08:52.140 --> 2:08:57.740]  someone that's no longer human it's real simple I mean 25 years ago you said
[2:08:57.740 --> 2:09:01.780]  Alex these aren't people these are entities and I just but now you just see
[2:09:01.780 --> 2:09:08.420]  it oh yeah because again the context of time is cotton up or it has caught up
[2:09:08.420 --> 2:09:12.500]  not caught up caught up with the revelation that people can now see it
[2:09:12.500 --> 2:09:19.660]  look Hollywood Hollywood has primed the masses every single movie priming the
[2:09:19.660 --> 2:09:24.620]  masses whether it's the series of surviving in times or Jericho or any of
[2:09:24.620 --> 2:09:30.540]  the other things but what we're getting ready Alex to deal with is Arthur C
[2:09:30.540 --> 2:09:34.700]  Clark's childhood exactly you told us what was coming now you'll tell us what's
[2:09:34.700 --> 2:09:37.620]  coming next wow Steve quail see quail.com

[2:13:05.220 --> 2:13:09.380]  do occasionally you really lay it out lay out where we are what we can do what's
[2:13:09.380 --> 2:13:14.540]  really happening well first of all we we have to recognize we are under full
[2:13:14.540 --> 2:13:21.180]  scale communist siege they have already taken us the voice that we have or in
[2:13:21.180 --> 2:13:25.900]  the process of taking us out of a free speech realm the next thing that they're
[2:13:25.900 --> 2:13:30.140]  going for is the guns that they meeting the communists or has never been a
[2:13:30.140 --> 2:13:35.300]  communist overthrow in which tens of millions of people have not died and
[2:13:35.300 --> 2:13:39.620]  the guns were the first thing they wanted I'm told alex that the demand that
[2:13:39.620 --> 2:13:44.420]  the Chinese overlords of the democrats and the republicans that sold out
[2:13:44.420 --> 2:13:49.260]  traders and both are demanding that American people give up their guns
[2:13:49.260 --> 2:13:54.620]  they're demanding they be taken that taken from us all and they demand that
[2:13:54.620 --> 2:14:01.140]  anybody who will not go along with quote the plan of revolution must be put
[2:14:01.140 --> 2:14:04.140]  to death now I want to make something really clear I'm sorry I'm getting fired
[2:14:04.140 --> 2:14:07.980]  up right now thank you for the opportunity to come on ladies gentlemen
[2:14:07.980 --> 2:14:10.940]  the Chinese are on record of saying when they invade the United States they're
[2:14:10.940 --> 2:14:15.140]  going to kill every man woman and child by the way that includes the
[2:14:15.140 --> 2:14:21.740]  democratic and republican traders they do not have any qualms general how she
[2:14:21.740 --> 2:14:27.660]  on h a o t i a n jet nike was did a fabulous article on him they plan to
[2:14:27.660 --> 2:14:33.460]  kill every man woman and child it is a spiritual war I'm calling everybody
[2:14:33.460 --> 2:14:40.340]  alex worldwide to repentance before revolution repentance will assure the
[2:14:40.340 --> 2:14:45.740]  people that that know why this country is in the shape it is because listen
[2:14:45.740 --> 2:14:50.980]  everyone we are at the end I am just seeing that these are called your farewell
[2:14:50.980 --> 2:14:56.100]  broadcast you and I both know you were told by Matt drudge that our days are
[2:14:56.100 --> 2:15:01.980]  numbered where our days are limited and it's imperative that people understand
[2:15:01.980 --> 2:15:07.820]  that there is no one coming to your rescue except the living God this is a
[2:15:07.820 --> 2:15:13.620]  lot Luciferian globalist cabal these people worship Lucifer we have slain
[2:15:13.620 --> 2:15:17.980]  the innocent a hundred million people say what is this abortion we have to do
[2:15:17.980 --> 2:15:22.700]  with anything that was the fuel that was the fuel that opens the gate for God to
[2:15:22.700 --> 2:15:28.260]  remove the protection absolutely and so when people used to use this statement
[2:15:28.260 --> 2:15:33.980]  about some third world country they used to say a God forsaken place I believe
[2:15:33.980 --> 2:15:38.380]  the United States has become that because you know even in biblical
[2:15:38.380 --> 2:15:42.380]  prophecy there's there's statements in the book of Jeremiah that when nations
[2:15:42.380 --> 2:15:47.740]  turn against God they become a hissing in other words people I hold us in
[2:15:47.740 --> 2:15:52.380]  contempt we've got enemies within our government and look at everything
[2:15:52.380 --> 2:15:57.740]  treachery treason the devil you know we're open season that's what this is and
[2:15:57.740 --> 2:16:00.980]  you talk about it that the tens of millions of children were killed we're
[2:16:00.980 --> 2:16:04.500]  not trying to be negative give us your view on cue because again it would talk
[2:16:04.500 --> 2:16:07.060]  about a lot of real things we're already going on you talked about 20 years ago
[2:16:07.060 --> 2:16:10.860]  but then it would claim everything's fine go back to sleep no no we need to get
[2:16:10.860 --> 2:16:16.900]  close to God God is trust the plan well and I gotta tell you something from the
[2:16:16.900 --> 2:16:24.140]  beginning from the beginning I have absolutely stated Q anonymous is not
[2:16:24.140 --> 2:16:29.980]  real I have stated from the beginning I've not posted one story outside of
[2:16:29.980 --> 2:16:35.740]  something I put up in my alert Q anonymous is counterintelligence counter
[2:16:35.740 --> 2:16:41.420]  intelligence they were put into practice because they know this Americans want to
[2:16:41.420 --> 2:16:46.260]  believe the best America's looking for a political solution there was no
[2:16:46.260 --> 2:16:51.020]  political solution there's only a spiritual solution to a spiritual
[2:16:51.020 --> 2:16:56.940]  problem and I'm on record Alex is saying Q is three and this is what I was
[2:16:56.940 --> 2:17:02.100]  told by people that I know they know because they live in that world is three
[2:17:02.100 --> 2:17:08.420]  intelligence heads running the themes through AI scanning programs of what is
[2:17:08.420 --> 2:17:13.020]  the hot button of the conservatives what is exactly what I was told by people in
[2:17:13.020 --> 2:17:16.460]  the White House but they said but we're trying to get it on our side and I said
[2:17:16.460 --> 2:17:19.460]  you can't get it on the side it'll only act like it's on your side and betray you
[2:17:19.460 --> 2:17:23.660]  later now through Q they're gonna try to mass bloody uprisings to trigger the
[2:17:23.660 --> 2:17:27.380]  pretext for the gun confiscation you just mentioned absolutely I'm telling
[2:17:27.380 --> 2:17:33.580]  everybody do not go to march on any capitals it's important you understand
[2:17:33.580 --> 2:17:37.340]  this under the national defense of authors a snack you covered it I've
[2:17:37.340 --> 2:17:43.980]  covered it but here's the deal they want to grab the low-hanging fruit they are
[2:17:43.980 --> 2:17:48.540]  going to introduce shooters who is going to introduce shooters the people
[2:17:48.540 --> 2:17:53.940]  behind the false flag the false flags we talked about it we've worn people about
[2:17:53.940 --> 2:17:58.540]  it yet when they come to pass people just don't see it the control of the
[2:17:58.540 --> 2:18:03.260]  narrative of president Donald Trump's presidency has resulted in where we're
[2:18:03.260 --> 2:18:08.260]  at right now Alex and that place is a very tough place and so when people say
[2:18:08.260 --> 2:18:12.700]  we'll trust the program here's the program you were isolated you were cut off
[2:18:12.700 --> 2:18:18.500]  you believed a lie it was designed to keep people the common American citizens
[2:18:18.500 --> 2:18:23.380]  from coming together and saying there's something really funny with this Q is
[2:18:23.380 --> 2:18:28.740]  absolutely counterintelligence program being run by the the heads of the
[2:18:28.740 --> 2:18:33.660]  different intelligence agencies to basically act a put put people that care
[2:18:33.660 --> 2:18:37.540]  concerned people people who love the country patriots to say everything's
[2:18:37.540 --> 2:18:40.740]  fine so let's say this I just talked to a lot of people I've seen the great
[2:18:40.740 --> 2:18:43.980]  relief programs you've done also behind the scenes you've been around a long
[2:18:43.980 --> 2:18:47.420]  time there are good people in the FBI and the CIA and the government but how do
[2:18:47.420 --> 2:18:50.540]  you know good from bad you just trust Christ and you just move forward
[2:18:50.540 --> 2:18:54.620]  yourself and be good you can't put faith in in Alex Jones or Steve Quill or
[2:18:54.620 --> 2:18:58.940]  anybody got to put it in Jesus amen and the Bible literally says a woman to the
[2:18:58.940 --> 2:19:05.020]  arm of or a woman to the man who leans on the arm of flesh should not a people
[2:19:05.020 --> 2:19:08.260]  created by the living God look to you now I'm gonna share something I don't
[2:19:08.260 --> 2:19:12.940]  apologize for the faith I don't apologize for Jesus Christ they've been
[2:19:12.940 --> 2:19:17.500]  warning people this day we come in and we're at we are in the end they're
[2:19:17.500 --> 2:19:20.580]  saying Christians can't have jobs that next means they're gonna I will never
[2:19:20.580 --> 2:19:24.260]  renounce Christ it's not even a hard choice I'm ready right now I will never
[2:19:24.260 --> 2:19:28.700]  renounce it right and and Alex we've got to get everybody to that because
[2:19:28.700 --> 2:19:32.540]  ladies and gentlemen it's not that you have to go looking for the fight the
[2:19:32.540 --> 2:19:37.900]  fight is coming to you choose the day of your battles why you just said it the
[2:19:37.900 --> 2:19:43.180]  fight's coming to us now it's on the offense and I got to share something what
[2:19:43.180 --> 2:19:47.500]  gave to any authority just like there's three screwballs out of the internet
[2:19:47.500 --> 2:19:50.300]  saying this is gonna happen this is gonna happen this is gonna happen I want
[2:19:50.300 --> 2:19:54.660]  to ask you one simple question about you everyone why did they say things would
[2:19:54.660 --> 2:19:58.700]  happen they never happened why would the president make a statement he's gonna
[2:19:58.700 --> 2:20:02.620]  release this or that and he didn't do it when he said it would every time watch
[2:20:02.620 --> 2:20:08.340]  us every time the president said he's going to do something he got circumvented
[2:20:08.340 --> 2:20:11.300]  and they're doing it under him insurrection we heard the insurrection
[2:20:11.300 --> 2:20:14.700]  act was going to be enabled we heard military tribunals were going to be
[2:20:14.700 --> 2:20:17.740]  competing but he was a political quadriplegic not his fault they weren't
[2:20:17.740 --> 2:20:24.020]  following orders it's but let me tell you hi I see president Donald Trump people
[2:20:24.020 --> 2:20:28.740]  whether you love him whether you hate him when people hate him without a cause
[2:20:28.740 --> 2:20:31.620]  hold on stay there and we got to go some in the next hour and it matters is
[2:20:31.620 --> 2:20:35.820]  coming up but you're on fire everybody's on fire this is the time of fire and the
[2:20:35.820 --> 2:20:40.180]  time of judgment and I just I'm with Jesus 110% stay well right back with

[2:24:25.100 --> 2:24:29.420]  debos group the globalist the club of Rome but quail was taken even further
[2:24:29.420 --> 2:24:34.460]  and then I like got to know some of the people high level there were patriots
[2:24:34.460 --> 2:24:38.060]  in u.s. intelligence they go you know quail's like highly respected he's not a
[2:24:38.060 --> 2:24:41.060]  joke I don't think it's a joke I just didn't didn't understand that you guys
[2:24:41.060 --> 2:24:44.660]  all listen to him and so here's steve quail with us next segment we'll talk
[2:24:44.660 --> 2:24:48.820]  about some of the new information he's about to release but about Antarctica and
[2:24:48.820 --> 2:24:52.700]  more and these secrets are trying to suppress and they say in 150 days all
[2:24:52.700 --> 2:24:55.780]  this alien technology is gonna be released I mean big stuff's going down
[2:24:55.780 --> 2:25:00.220]  obviously but but but get back into the globalist communist takeover what's
[2:25:00.220 --> 2:25:03.380]  about to unfold and what they're doing and just all the stuff you were telling
[2:25:03.380 --> 2:25:09.620]  me during that break well first of all people you you're we were all being
[2:25:09.620 --> 2:25:15.020]  starved into submission the famine that is coming I'm talking to literal famine
[2:25:15.020 --> 2:25:18.660]  is already starting to manifest people from all over the country all over
[2:25:18.660 --> 2:25:22.420]  actually the world are saying but we're seeing empty shelves we're seeing it
[2:25:22.420 --> 2:25:28.060]  Alex the Henry Kissinger statement is absolutely coming into focus now you
[2:25:28.060 --> 2:25:32.540]  know the fact is with food they control the people one of the u.s. folks women
[2:25:32.540 --> 2:25:38.380]  said we decide the United Nations decides who lives who dies now enter the
[2:25:38.380 --> 2:25:43.180]  biggest food owner the biggest company food company owner in the world Bill
[2:25:43.180 --> 2:25:48.620]  Gates okay Bill Gates did more to validate the biblical mark of the
[2:25:48.620 --> 2:25:53.100]  beast and I would say 99% of the preachers in America he said you won't be
[2:25:53.100 --> 2:25:56.220]  able to buy you won't be able to sell you won't be able to trade and he added
[2:25:56.220 --> 2:26:01.700]  another to travel but isn't it interesting that you see the vaccination
[2:26:01.700 --> 2:26:07.220]  shot the arms shot in the head either way you end up dead no trials and only
[2:26:07.220 --> 2:26:12.380]  hearing all of the anything that you say that's scientifically accurate
[2:26:12.380 --> 2:26:17.820]  assassinated so that truth has been assassinated is being assassinated the
[2:26:17.820 --> 2:26:22.820]  truth tellers are being cut off we're being de-platformed and ladies and
[2:26:22.820 --> 2:26:28.380]  gentlemen saying is the assault is here the assault is here the assault started
[2:26:28.380 --> 2:26:33.260]  Alex with faces of death book and Twitter Twitter pitter-patter okay because
[2:26:33.260 --> 2:26:39.020]  again you control the narrative you define the outcome this is psychological
[2:26:39.020 --> 2:26:44.220]  warfare I read one of your books a long time ago I forget that the the the but
[2:26:44.220 --> 2:26:47.860]  was about it was like in game was about extermination depopulation what was
[2:26:47.860 --> 2:26:52.020]  the name of that book genetic Armageddon today's technology tomorrow's I read
[2:26:52.020 --> 2:26:54.540]  that one too that was a lot but what was the other one you wrote another one
[2:26:54.540 --> 2:26:59.980]  about the plan to terminate humanity well the xenogenesis I mean I've written
[2:26:59.980 --> 2:27:03.780]  three of them yeah what was the other one it was another one that terminated
[2:27:03.780 --> 2:27:06.860]  terminated that was it I remember reading that that scared the hell out of me
[2:27:06.860 --> 2:27:10.580]  because I knew all the stuff in the book but I had put it together yeah and
[2:27:10.580 --> 2:27:16.220]  that's the key you know here's the thing ladies and gentlemen we're seeing now and
[2:27:16.220 --> 2:27:22.940]  I want to make this statement seven years ago before President Trump even you
[2:27:22.940 --> 2:27:28.260]  know obviously became president I made the statement before God allows China and
[2:27:28.260 --> 2:27:32.940]  Russia to destroy the United States in a nuclear attack he's going to reveal the
[2:27:32.940 --> 2:27:36.860]  sins of the leaders to the people and the people sins before a holy God
[2:27:36.860 --> 2:27:41.900]  everybody has watched the narrative some of the sickest so bees on the planet
[2:27:41.900 --> 2:27:47.500]  those are sons of Belial meaning ball and we've seen it we're seeing the deep
[2:27:47.500 --> 2:27:54.260]  state you are seeing the deep state absolutely exerting your control you're
[2:27:54.260 --> 2:28:00.380]  seeing Miss Peacock Nancy Pelosi you're seeing the Hilda bees Hillary calling the
[2:28:00.380 --> 2:28:05.740]  shots you saw Alex and I want to share this formula I shared this formula almost
[2:28:05.740 --> 2:28:11.260]  20 years ago on talk radio now see where we're at I BND India Victor November
[2:28:11.260 --> 2:28:16.500]  Delta identify vilify nullify destroy ladies and gentlemen the devil has one
[2:28:16.500 --> 2:28:22.380]  purpose to destroy first and foremost all Christians and then all humans the
[2:28:22.380 --> 2:28:26.700]  whole transhumanism movement combining mini-machines but there's another
[2:28:26.700 --> 2:28:32.140]  problem that demons that disembodied spirits they evil spirits are now
[2:28:32.140 --> 2:28:36.700]  possessing machines and this is what you said 25 years ago my show as it gets
[2:28:36.700 --> 2:28:40.340]  more obvious they're gonna be out of control and now I mean look at Brian
[2:28:40.340 --> 2:28:44.620]  Stelter and even Hillary they look like like they're in the exorcist movie
[2:28:44.620 --> 2:28:49.460]  vomiting green pea soup they are all out of control what's going on with them
[2:28:49.460 --> 2:28:54.620]  well first of all that which has been submerged in hidden is now being
[2:28:54.620 --> 2:29:00.700]  manifest the demons know the fallen angels know the devils know they know
[2:29:00.700 --> 2:29:05.340]  their time has come even the Bible says the devil what one to you and have
[2:29:05.340 --> 2:29:09.540]  severe for for the devil has come down amongst you knowing his time is short
[2:29:09.540 --> 2:29:14.700]  interesting even the devil knows about time so as he knows his time is short
[2:29:14.700 --> 2:29:20.460]  he's going to go into maximum overdrive he's gonna kill murder just like what
[2:29:20.460 --> 2:29:24.060]  Hitler knew he was he could have won World War two but he wanted to kill as
[2:29:24.060 --> 2:29:28.380]  many people as he could so he lost it just to kill people absolutely because
[2:29:28.380 --> 2:29:32.620]  here's the thing unless people understand the biblical war going on from
[2:29:32.620 --> 2:29:37.260]  the Genesis the first couple chapters to the end and that's where you always
[2:29:37.260 --> 2:29:40.860]  explain it's always about genetic manipulation of humans which Gates is
[2:29:40.860 --> 2:29:46.020]  obsessed with explain that well first of all again the the war on the human
[2:29:46.020 --> 2:29:51.420]  genome the image and likeness of God has been tampered with by fallen angels
[2:29:51.420 --> 2:29:55.300]  that's what the basis of Genesis 6 was the sons of God saw that the daughters
[2:29:55.300 --> 2:29:59.420]  of earth women were fair came unto them and bore a race of giants Alex I've
[2:29:59.420 --> 2:30:03.900]  spent 40 years of my life tracking all the legends missing everything making
[2:30:03.900 --> 2:30:07.740]  movies about it getting eyewitness testimony on but you see it's one thing
[2:30:07.740 --> 2:30:11.100]  in the book it's another thing what's the science fiction movie then it really
[2:30:11.100 --> 2:30:14.220]  hits home when it's in your bag well you always obsessed on this but then they
[2:30:14.220 --> 2:30:18.060]  put out the Prometheus movie where the original aliens that look like Marlon
[2:30:18.060 --> 2:30:21.300]  Brando the this big alien creature that you basically track the globalist
[2:30:21.300 --> 2:30:24.300]  worship and then the maker of it basically a minute of the New York Times we
[2:30:24.300 --> 2:30:27.780]  believe this is our religion we believe this is a real group that made us this is
[2:30:27.780 --> 2:30:32.580]  our cult of Transpermia or whatever it's called these so the globalists are in a
[2:30:32.580 --> 2:30:36.700]  UFO cult and make movies showing us that they believe the rulers are and I saw
[2:30:36.700 --> 2:30:40.660]  that moving ago this is what Steve Quill said 20 years ago and it's called
[2:30:40.660 --> 2:30:46.260]  panspermia okay and and and the here's what's going on okay I want everybody
[2:30:46.260 --> 2:30:50.980]  just to just take a look at Arthur C. Clarke's childhood and in essence the
[2:30:50.980 --> 2:30:55.460]  aliens come and they're they they mask their appearance and they do
[2:30:55.460 --> 2:30:59.100]  supposedly all these good things for earth things I can tell you this Alex
[2:30:59.100 --> 2:31:05.100]  from insiders that basically are as as as inside as you can get the Catholic
[2:31:05.100 --> 2:31:09.380]  Church had a meeting of all the Cardinals the secret meeting they're
[2:31:09.380 --> 2:31:15.260]  getting ready to launch the aliens are our gods because one of the most famous
[2:31:15.260 --> 2:31:22.140]  Catholic theologian scientist Guy Cosmogano Cosmogano wrote a 50 page
[2:31:22.140 --> 2:31:26.740]  little essay book and I'll send it to you but as soon as we're done the broadcast
[2:31:26.740 --> 2:31:32.900]  but the whole idea is this mankind is out of control we can't even save our
[2:31:32.900 --> 2:31:37.780]  own race but the aliens will come it's kind of like to serve man the twilight
[2:31:37.780 --> 2:31:41.020]  zone but here's what's happening ladies and gentlemen the genetic
[2:31:41.020 --> 2:31:46.260]  manipulation of the human genome secret labs are building things that came out
[2:31:46.260 --> 2:31:51.300]  of Jules Verne's the the island of Dr. Murrow or H. G. Wells are all of the
[2:31:51.300 --> 2:31:56.940]  the people that were futurists that were seeing that now men into monsters turning
[2:31:56.940 --> 2:32:03.740]  men into monsters and now Alex terminated the human race is is basically
[2:32:03.740 --> 2:32:09.140]  going to be terminated that's why some of the most famous transhumanists those
[2:32:09.140 --> 2:32:14.420]  who believe that they can make a better man by combining genetic alteration with
[2:32:14.420 --> 2:32:19.260]  machines becoming singular one with machines the devil and machine the ghost
[2:32:19.260 --> 2:32:24.420]  machine those are the people running the planet and Zoltan East fun very famous
[2:32:24.420 --> 2:32:28.860]  transhumanist at the heart at the heart of every transhumanist they don't want
[2:32:28.860 --> 2:32:34.740]  to die and that's the same promise that the devil made to Eve surely you will not
[2:32:34.740 --> 2:32:39.380]  die and so that promises the biggest lie in the universe and it's now being
[2:32:39.380 --> 2:32:46.540]  perpetuated ladies and gentlemen this is our Red Sea moment the Red Sea means
[2:32:46.540 --> 2:32:50.580]  we've come up against odds we cannot overcome in our own strength we've got
[2:32:50.580 --> 2:32:55.420]  and you're saying it's the Bible's true God is gonna deliver us then I'm saying
[2:32:55.420 --> 2:32:59.780]  this God delivers those who call upon his name God didn't deliver everybody
[2:32:59.780 --> 2:33:05.260]  Egyptians drowned in the Red Sea and so what I'm saying to people is that people
[2:33:05.260 --> 2:33:10.700]  have to appropriate God's provision by faith and it starts with repentance as
[2:33:10.700 --> 2:33:14.220]  a nation you know the Prophet Daniel most famous Prophet Neil Testament pretty
[2:33:14.220 --> 2:33:18.820]  much and when it comes to the end times or the end of the age Daniel chapter 9
[2:33:18.820 --> 2:33:22.540]  verses 4 through 19 just for those that want to go look at I'm gonna come back
[2:33:22.540 --> 2:33:26.580]  he foreshadows everything that comes through all right Steve Quill is again
[2:33:26.580 --> 2:33:29.540]  all our guests are on fire this is flamethrower hot though right now
[2:33:29.540 --> 2:33:32.300]  absolutely what's happening the globalists are not atheists they're all
[2:33:32.300 --> 2:33:34.620]  occultist they believe this is all happening
[2:33:34.620 --> 2:33:37.980]  Arthur C. Clark admitted that there's like a psychic vision he had about
[2:33:37.980 --> 2:33:42.700]  childhoods in the red back Mountain Patriot in Colorado thank you for
[2:33:42.700 --> 2:33:47.140]  holding how you doing Alex man I'm just working as hard as I can we're in such a
[2:33:47.140 --> 2:33:51.300]  critical time brother how are you I love you man I want to make a quick plug
[2:33:51.300 --> 2:33:55.860]  that DNA force I love it I've been using it quite a while and I just went
[2:33:55.860 --> 2:33:59.500]  looked at the ingredients again the other day and I see that it contains
[2:33:59.500 --> 2:34:05.300]  Corsican which according to some published studies that Dr. Mercola has
[2:34:05.300 --> 2:34:11.740]  cited is an ionophore similar to hydroxychloroquine and it helps channel
[2:34:11.740 --> 2:34:16.620]  the dink into the cell so people might want to take a look at that all I know
[2:34:16.620 --> 2:34:22.180]  is with DNA force we went out and looked at these high-end products that they
[2:34:22.180 --> 2:34:25.220]  sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription but the doctor self like
[2:34:25.220 --> 2:34:28.020]  300 bucks a bottle because there's a lot of expensive product and it was
[2:34:28.020 --> 2:34:31.940]  really only cost them like 50 bucks and so we basically cloned two different
[2:34:31.940 --> 2:34:35.620]  top brands together and that's what produced this so thanks thanks for the
[2:34:35.620 --> 2:34:44.740]  plug I want to warn all patriots in the United States and across the world
[2:34:44.740 --> 2:34:48.900]  they're listening to my voice I'm Alex Jones I've been in this fight 27 years
[2:34:48.900 --> 2:34:53.500]  I've studied every angle of their operations and I'm here to tell you as
[2:34:53.500 --> 2:34:59.580]  clear as day they have organizations on message boards and other groups posing
[2:34:59.580 --> 2:35:04.500]  as patriot leaders and posing as president Trump anonymously telling you

[2:35:23.620 --> 2:35:29.860]  the thing was a misfire it was a dud but the left is hungry to declare all Trump
[2:35:29.860 --> 2:35:32.900]  supporters terrorist and they're planning terrorist attacks and mass
[2:35:32.900 --> 2:35:37.820]  shootings on the 20th to blame the American people do not be part of it we

[2:37:58.980 --> 2:38:01.940]  join us again next week I'm trying to get on for a year we've been all the
[2:38:01.940 --> 2:38:06.740]  world making films and writing books but he's back and so we really look forward
[2:38:06.740 --> 2:38:10.020]  to him coming on for at least a couple hours next week we'll do a commercial
[2:38:10.020 --> 2:38:13.580]  free podcast out of the air on the main show but just look at all these
[2:38:13.580 --> 2:38:17.940]  headlines CNBC Bill Gates funded chemical cloud could help stop global
[2:38:17.940 --> 2:38:23.420]  warming Bill Gates is trying to dim the sun wash an examiner the first person I
[2:38:23.420 --> 2:38:26.860]  heard other than collars I had collars calling saying you know ice crystals
[2:38:26.860 --> 2:38:31.660]  condensation clouds used to disappear in like a few minutes I'm like yeah I was a
[2:38:31.660 --> 2:38:35.980]  kid you'd watch one up high cold weather it would it would it would create nuclear
[2:38:35.980 --> 2:38:39.060]  eye off the tips of the plane and you'd see an ice crystals for a while and they
[2:38:39.060 --> 2:38:44.860]  would melt in the sun but then start in the mid 90s they they didn't sometimes a
[2:38:44.860 --> 2:38:48.700]  plane right next to another plane would well lately the CIA director five years
[2:38:48.700 --> 2:38:50.940]  ago came out and said oh we're doing this on purpose the secret weather
[2:38:50.940 --> 2:38:55.580]  modification and then now Bill Gates says he wants to dim the sun and now we've
[2:38:55.580 --> 2:39:03.220]  got Lena del Rey and our new music video coming up next hour Kim trails and
[2:39:03.220 --> 2:39:08.180]  country clubs Kim trails over the country club so this is going mainstream no
[2:39:08.180 --> 2:39:11.740]  matter what they want but they admit at the UN they have treaties they admit
[2:39:11.740 --> 2:39:15.820]  they're doing it on C spam but then we talk about it we're crazy you were the
[2:39:15.820 --> 2:39:19.900]  first guy to write about Kim trails weren't you yes I was and you know Alex
[2:39:19.900 --> 2:39:24.100]  here's something that some people need to say or need to hear there's a
[2:39:24.100 --> 2:39:29.380]  difference between claiming to be a profit and being a and I'm not I've
[2:39:29.380 --> 2:39:33.620]  never claimed that you know you've listened to me 25 years never had so when
[2:39:33.620 --> 2:39:38.940]  I put out the film this is important Cascadia you know that that gets set
[2:39:38.940 --> 2:39:42.900]  because the scientists are really concerned with that and having massive
[2:39:42.900 --> 2:39:47.540]  attacks if it didn't happen when during the time I'm warning about it you know
[2:39:47.540 --> 2:39:51.900]  people automatically just dismiss it you know but let me just put an end to this
[2:39:51.900 --> 2:39:57.860]  moronic thing that we're conspiracy theorists we are absolutely telling you
[2:39:57.860 --> 2:40:02.540]  of the secret plans ahead of time and here's what a conspiracy is a secret
[2:40:02.540 --> 2:40:07.460]  plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful a conspiracy an
[2:40:07.460 --> 2:40:12.460]  agreement to say nothing about an issue that should be generally known but
[2:40:12.460 --> 2:40:15.780]  Steve people really aren't questioning us now that's what I'm saying they
[2:40:15.780 --> 2:40:19.540]  should oh yeah research I'm saying people actually get it now so what is the
[2:40:19.540 --> 2:40:24.020]  system going to do as they're trying to declassify this as fast as they can to
[2:40:24.020 --> 2:40:29.060]  normalize it why are they doing that well first of all they're they're trying
[2:40:29.060 --> 2:40:34.020]  as fast as they can to de-platform us to silence us here at the end of the day
[2:40:34.020 --> 2:40:38.940]  Alex let's just use the C word control anybody who tells the truth and by the
[2:40:38.940 --> 2:40:43.260]  way you know the pundits will be the pundits but anybody who tells the truth
[2:40:43.260 --> 2:40:48.660]  is has to be shut up because when you control the narrative remember this the
[2:40:48.660 --> 2:40:56.300]  narrative is the globalist plan for complete new world order take down and
[2:40:56.300 --> 2:41:00.900]  take over of the planet under Lucifer and you mean every plant every animal
[2:41:00.900 --> 2:41:04.860]  every cell remember you 25 years ago saying they want to control Alex not
[2:41:04.860 --> 2:41:07.980]  just the plants they want to control us they're gonna have vaccines that rewrite
[2:41:07.980 --> 2:41:13.820]  our genetics and it's all here now it's all here now and here's the thing when
[2:41:13.820 --> 2:41:19.300]  they make the statement that there's no guarantee the vaccine will keep you from
[2:41:19.300 --> 2:41:23.180]  getting COVID-19 by the way I'm on record it is not shouldn't even be called
[2:41:23.180 --> 2:41:27.860]  that it should be called the Wuhan virus and it has multiple mutations the
[2:41:27.860 --> 2:41:33.780]  third mutation showing up in Brazil it's it's a bio weapon you can whitewash it
[2:41:33.780 --> 2:41:37.340]  you can do everything but the reason Alex they wouldn't tell the truth on that
[2:41:37.340 --> 2:41:40.940]  present told the truth but the reason that the mainstream won't tell the truth
[2:41:40.940 --> 2:41:45.300]  is because of their ownership by the very people that released the bio weapon
[2:41:45.300 --> 2:41:50.980]  Wuhan is only one bio lab and remember is this a blackmail deal by the Chinese
[2:41:50.980 --> 2:41:55.260]  to because Gates paid for it since 2015 we know it moved their Chapel Hill
[2:41:55.260 --> 2:41:59.500]  congressional debates about it then Gates and Fauci do it then they run the
[2:41:59.500 --> 2:42:04.940]  response to it I mean it's ridiculous how obvious this is it is ridiculous you
[2:42:04.940 --> 2:42:10.220]  generate you pay for the the creation of a bio weapon then you pay for the tests
[2:42:10.220 --> 2:42:15.460]  of the bio weapon then you pay for the vaccine you control I think that you
[2:42:15.460 --> 2:42:19.260]  profit from the lockdown and the control and push it global passport to travel in
[2:42:19.260 --> 2:42:23.220]  the world ID and forced inoculation injectable nano chips I mean it's their
[2:42:23.220 --> 2:42:27.660]  whole agenda but their agenda now is that your front door it's at my front
[2:42:27.660 --> 2:42:32.460]  door they're telling you got to wear a face mask which is biologically insane
[2:42:32.460 --> 2:42:38.220]  anybody with a basic understanding of the size of a virus and my cross it's
[2:42:38.220 --> 2:42:42.340]  like having an open window it's like having a 5,000 foot wide window for a
[2:42:42.340 --> 2:42:46.580]  mosquito to fly through yeah that's a great analogy but listen it cuts off
[2:42:46.580 --> 2:42:52.100]  person-to-person contact ladies and gentlemen that thing the devil hates is
[2:42:52.100 --> 2:42:57.140]  the image of man whether that image of man and woman no that's just like Islam
[2:42:57.140 --> 2:43:01.180]  covering the woman's face it's covering us it's covering we're dirty humans are
[2:43:01.180 --> 2:43:05.300]  bad it's the devil wants to kill someone destroy he hates the image of God it's
[2:43:05.300 --> 2:43:09.900]  all about covering that face right and I tell you this if America does not
[2:43:09.900 --> 2:43:15.540]  realize that that mask is our yellow star moment all right that mask is a sign
[2:43:15.540 --> 2:43:21.420]  of submission there is no intellectual reason there is no scientific reason but
[2:43:21.420 --> 2:43:26.660]  look at the Nazis they're Milgram experiment little monsters your if
[2:43:26.660 --> 2:43:29.880]  your mask is down below your nose if you got to go you got to wear a mask blah
[2:43:29.880 --> 2:43:34.140]  blah blah blah they're cutting off the children's oxygen supply isn't amazing
[2:43:34.140 --> 2:43:39.100]  they make little Johnny and Mary wear masks in school it's incredibly
[2:43:39.100 --> 2:43:42.860]  diabolical what about President Trump what should he do in the four and a half
[2:43:42.860 --> 2:43:47.260]  days left he has and what does it do to Q that said he was invincible trust the
[2:43:47.260 --> 2:43:53.460]  plan now the Q priest are saying oh Trump was nothing Q continues on well
[2:43:53.460 --> 2:43:59.140]  that's total bold manure and the thing is is it's just like this the you know
[2:43:59.140 --> 2:44:03.500]  I'm sure you get anti Q emails I'm getting them now but the point that I'm
[2:44:03.500 --> 2:44:08.220]  trying to make is this it's one thing to say it at the beginning it's another
[2:44:08.220 --> 2:44:12.780]  thing to see the cop out at the end look I can tell I can't tell you when
[2:44:12.780 --> 2:44:17.180]  Yellowstone is not gonna erupt I can tell you this I was on coast to coast this
[2:44:17.180 --> 2:44:20.820]  is important I want to just make one thing George Norrie interviewing me on
[2:44:20.820 --> 2:44:25.220]  Cascadia and the danger scientists were out of country running for their lives
[2:44:25.220 --> 2:44:29.820]  threatened with that literally their death if they talk they send them any a
[2:44:29.820 --> 2:44:34.980]  fast blast or whatever it's called and he say thank you for having Steve on
[2:44:34.980 --> 2:44:40.180]  he's telling you what we're not allowed to the truth is covered up the truth is
[2:44:40.180 --> 2:44:44.780]  covered over Jesus is the truth and the pulp pits are now saying don't listen
[2:44:44.780 --> 2:44:49.140]  to those conspiracy guys oh really well if you're preaching from the Bible oh
[2:44:49.140 --> 2:44:52.820]  you don't believe that anymore but if you're preaching even in the realm of
[2:44:52.820 --> 2:44:56.700]  why can't you make a statement don't believe the conspiracy guys but you
[2:44:56.700 --> 2:45:00.780]  don't even know how to find the word conspiracy and what's happening now Alex
[2:45:00.780 --> 2:45:05.340]  you're seeing the stories you're seeing the stories of absolute I would say this
[2:45:05.340 --> 2:45:11.940]  surrender to the globalist at the expense at the expense of our lives our
[2:45:11.940 --> 2:45:14.980]  children's lives and our grandchildren well that's what they said they say take
[2:45:14.980 --> 2:45:18.580]  the inoculation we'll let you go back to work and I go oh actually not and then
[2:45:18.580 --> 2:45:24.300]  mass death is happening from the vaccine what is this mRNA vaccine messenger
[2:45:24.300 --> 2:45:28.580]  RNA vaccine is an interesting thing and it's interesting because messenger and
[2:45:28.580 --> 2:45:32.900]  I I'll say this messenger and it was pointed out to me in Greek as Angelo's
[2:45:32.900 --> 2:45:39.540]  so if you can basically say angel RNA angel right angel and that's it you
[2:45:39.540 --> 2:45:45.500]  got it it's a death angel and here's the thing in the Old Testament the fallen
[2:45:45.500 --> 2:45:48.940]  angels spoke before the flood and after flood came into the women that's why the
[2:45:48.940 --> 2:45:52.340]  Bible says in Genesis 6 or giants in those days and after those days see all
[2:45:52.340 --> 2:45:57.020]  that giant stuff is relevant the DNA extracted from that's a super soldier
[2:45:57.020 --> 2:46:00.260]  program remember when you and I talked about you talked about that 20 years ago
[2:46:00.260 --> 2:46:05.300]  now it's all confirmed their mRNA super soldier the Chinese you name it yeah
[2:46:05.300 --> 2:46:10.940]  and so here's the deal people will believe the headlines but they will do
[2:46:10.940 --> 2:46:15.740]  their own research yet they'll sit it with a you know like warrior info warrior
[2:46:15.740 --> 2:46:20.620]  this or that and they don't even do theirs all they sit around is sitting and
[2:46:20.620 --> 2:46:23.980]  saying well I don't believe Alex I don't believe Steve I don't believe this guy
[2:46:23.980 --> 2:46:27.420]  I don't believe that guy Mike Adams is you know I don't believe him either and
[2:46:27.420 --> 2:46:30.220]  my answer to all those people you're right you don't believe you haven't done
[2:46:30.220 --> 2:46:35.060]  your homework and so now the fact came out just came out I think today maybe
[2:46:35.060 --> 2:46:40.100]  yesterday that Bill Gates is the largest owner of farmland through his
[2:46:40.100 --> 2:46:45.940]  corporations while he tells us don't buy farmland six months ago you got it it's

[2:51:02.340 --> 2:51:08.620]  going with it Bill Gates and your latest work gen 6 giants well first of all
[2:51:08.620 --> 2:51:14.020]  Alex the UFO phenomenon is being seen all over the world the Catholic Church
[2:51:14.020 --> 2:51:19.140]  Tom Horn is documented the Catholics acceptance of aliens how they're gonna
[2:51:19.140 --> 2:51:23.900]  spring it on their flock I'm gonna basically send you a document so you
[2:51:23.900 --> 2:51:28.260]  can have it read it it'll just blow your mind ladies and gentlemen the
[2:51:28.260 --> 2:51:33.180]  telescope that the Vatican owns on Mount Graham it's a binocular telescope
[2:51:33.180 --> 2:51:38.500]  infrared and basically it's called the Lucifer scope okay now people say well
[2:51:38.500 --> 2:51:42.620]  that's just by accident there's nothing by accident there's nothing by accident
[2:51:42.620 --> 2:51:48.340]  that the enzyme that destroying humanity is called Luciferase LUC I
[2:51:48.340 --> 2:51:54.940]  FDR ASC what we're seeing Alex is this people can poo poo the supernatural and
[2:51:54.940 --> 2:52:00.380]  they can either do this repent repent repent that simply means saying God
[2:52:00.380 --> 2:52:05.140]  forgive me for my sins forgive me Lord because God can't help you unless you
[2:52:05.140 --> 2:52:08.500]  explain God's free will the devil is it we have to open the channel to God
[2:52:08.500 --> 2:52:12.060]  isn't like just oh we're praying God wants to worship we have to open the
[2:52:12.060 --> 2:52:17.940]  channel you can't just believe without repenting repent and believe and again I
[2:52:17.940 --> 2:52:22.920]  want to make it clear Alex nobody in the conservative movement that I know and
[2:52:22.920 --> 2:52:27.700]  conservative movement is this people who love life I'm gonna redefine the words
[2:52:27.700 --> 2:52:32.940]  people who love life are not criminals people who hate life isn't
[2:52:32.940 --> 2:52:36.820]  interesting those who want to take life kill kill kill kill kill kill it all boils
[2:52:36.820 --> 2:52:41.780]  down to this it all boils down to somebody wants to eradicate a hundred
[2:52:41.780 --> 2:52:45.420]  million people you and I did a report excuse me years ago on the Deagle report
[2:52:45.420 --> 2:52:49.100]  ladies and gentlemen the next five years according to Deagle report and
[2:52:49.100 --> 2:52:53.020]  who's behind that the heads of the Intel agencies so those who don't want to
[2:52:53.020 --> 2:52:58.340]  believe this fine but between this year and 2025 according to their report
[2:52:58.340 --> 2:53:01.900]  intelligence insiders they're gonna take the American population that's right
[2:53:01.900 --> 2:53:05.580]  official insurance actuaries say a hundred million less people in the U.S.
[2:53:05.580 --> 2:53:10.700]  specifically they've got a plan folks have got to fight it we got to fight it
[2:53:10.700 --> 2:53:15.380]  and so again well and you know Alex I want people to understand something the
[2:53:15.380 --> 2:53:20.220]  while they can get your supplements okay seriously ladies and gentlemen what
[2:53:20.220 --> 2:53:25.860]  everybody doesn't understand there's nothing in the pipeline what you use to
[2:53:25.860 --> 2:53:29.820]  make so I was about to say that's like pollen block we could use again this in
[2:53:29.820 --> 2:53:32.820]  a month from France from the quell eggs they eat a special diet for any
[2:53:32.820 --> 2:53:36.820]  histamine we was eight months we could get any it was like 25% most of our
[2:53:36.820 --> 2:53:41.860]  products we can't get anymore everything's breaking down well and here's
[2:53:41.860 --> 2:53:46.620]  the thing when the pipeline is empty there's nothing else in the pipeline so
[2:53:46.620 --> 2:53:51.780]  ladies and gentlemen seriously get what you can get now the money the
[2:53:51.780 --> 2:53:56.100]  development the research that Alex's company puts into this stuff get it now
[2:53:56.100 --> 2:54:00.940]  that's not a pitch it's a warning because what's going to happen you're
[2:54:00.940 --> 2:54:05.260]  gonna be given insect power and oh by the way they're gonna have urinal
[2:54:05.260 --> 2:54:11.500]  monitoring and toilet monitoring to make sure when you stand out of urinal with
[2:54:11.500 --> 2:54:16.580]  yours was smartphone or dumbass phone and basically you know I said that Alex
[2:54:16.580 --> 2:54:22.900]  and people said oh you're gonna eat bugs you're gonna eat bugs yeah now it's
[2:54:22.900 --> 2:54:27.300]  official so you can go to make hoppers I guess it'll be good and they say they're
[2:54:27.300 --> 2:54:29.900]  gonna use they're gonna monitor your urine to make sure you're not eating
[2:54:29.900 --> 2:54:34.380]  more meat than you're allotted this is a total AI or G and their signal put up
[2:54:34.380 --> 2:54:38.300]  with it incredible yeah and then and then Rand Paul brought out the fact that
[2:54:38.300 --> 2:54:43.620]  there was a lot of seven million dollar appropriation for toilet cams to get you
[2:54:43.620 --> 2:54:48.540]  know butt prints I'll leave it at that so ladies and gentlemen just because you
[2:54:48.540 --> 2:54:52.860]  want to the government funding public toilets with cameras on them and scanning
[2:54:52.860 --> 2:54:59.020]  your butt yeah and you know maybe that's why there's such a run-on toilet paper
[2:54:59.020 --> 2:55:03.060]  because there's so many people acting like butts I don't know the bottom
[2:55:03.060 --> 2:55:06.420]  no but it's all anti-human it's all to see what they get us to do it's all

[2:56:38.340 --> 2:56:53.820]  can welcome back ladies and gentlemen well five years ago the outgoing head
[2:56:53.820 --> 2:56:58.980]  of the CIA John Brennan went on C-Span and said we have secret treaties we're
[2:56:58.980 --> 2:57:03.580]  doing weather modification we had chemicals to the jet fuel and it creates
[2:57:03.580 --> 2:57:08.500]  nuclei then creates rain or ice clouds in the sky and it blocks out the sun to
[2:57:08.500 --> 2:57:13.220]  stop global warming I'm like yeah we have the Nobel Prize from 1992 it's on the
[2:57:13.220 --> 2:57:17.820]  CFR website it's all admitted but then if you talk about it you're crazy it
[2:57:17.820 --> 2:57:21.500]  doesn't exist well he says well we do this because other governments might get
[2:57:21.500 --> 2:57:25.740]  mad that we're causing droughts for their country and not for ours and this is a
[2:57:25.740 --> 2:57:30.340]  weather weapon so see I live in the adult world where I watch C-Span and watch
[2:57:30.340 --> 2:57:34.380]  Brennan admitting it I covered it 25 years ago before it was even known because
[2:57:34.380 --> 2:57:39.100]  people were noticing that suddenly condensation trails don't disappear in
[2:57:39.100 --> 2:57:42.400]  a few minutes like they used to ice crystals they stay and they become
[2:57:42.400 --> 2:57:48.060]  cloud banks because they're chem trails aluminum dioxide barium salts and becomes
[2:57:48.060 --> 2:57:53.500]  a litmus test to not cover it kind of like human animal hybrids that's been
[2:57:53.500 --> 2:57:57.260]  going on for 50 years I read at the medical literature 25 years ago in here
[2:57:57.260 --> 2:58:01.580]  that was happening decades before oh Jones is crazy now they're telling you
[2:58:01.580 --> 2:58:06.980]  all about it so it's admitted so here it is is Bill Gates financially backing
[2:58:06.980 --> 2:58:11.300]  efforts to dim the sun to fight global warming international business times it
[2:58:11.300 --> 2:58:16.540]  goes on to say yes he is Bill Gates wants to spray millions of tons of dust in
[2:58:16.540 --> 2:58:21.140]  the atmosphere to stop global warming well what puts him in charge to make us
[2:58:21.140 --> 2:58:24.940]  take vaccines or spray the clouds he wants that global authority he wants
[2:58:24.940 --> 2:58:32.620]  that power so Lana del Rey who is a great artist don't agree with all her
[2:58:32.620 --> 2:58:36.580]  politics has come out with a new music video the first of an album that comes
[2:58:36.580 --> 2:58:44.940]  out in March titled Tim trails over the country club and it's a very powerful
[2:58:44.940 --> 2:58:50.460]  esoteric pieces about to play because there's a surprise halfway through where
[2:58:50.460 --> 2:58:57.700]  they turn into vampires and that's the archetype of the feminine vampire and
[2:58:57.700 --> 2:59:02.180]  then they become the werewolf the race car becomes the werewolf and and then
[2:59:02.180 --> 2:59:05.580]  she merges with that and kind of transmutes it where she's not a parasite
[2:59:05.580 --> 2:59:09.140]  anymore but she's a human because the werewolves kind of a symbol of our raw
[2:59:09.140 --> 2:59:14.780]  bestiality vampirisms is a sign of the demonic possession but you have this
[2:59:14.780 --> 2:59:18.940]  backdrop of beautiful mansion in the summer and everybody's happy during the
[2:59:18.940 --> 2:59:24.940]  day but their witches and vampires and and and demons at night and what she's
[2:59:24.940 --> 2:59:28.900]  saying is I wear a mask but it's a mesh mask it's not protecting her the Kim
[2:59:28.900 --> 2:59:34.060]  trails are a symbol of the hidden evil of the backdrop and she has anxiety
[2:59:34.060 --> 2:59:38.540]  about evil but the evil's within her so the global snow you have anxiety you're
[2:59:38.540 --> 2:59:41.820]  scared but you're scared of them you're scared of what they're doing you're
[2:59:41.820 --> 2:59:48.020]  scared of what comes out at night and you're scared of what your own it is
[2:59:48.020 --> 2:59:56.020]  inside of you like forbidden planet so it's a very sophisticated piece and it's
[2:59:56.020 --> 3:00:02.380]  not that race eat some ice racy is a Miss America type video except women aren't
[3:00:02.380 --> 3:00:07.940]  anorexic or voluptuous but it really is powerful to see how something so hidden
[3:00:07.940 --> 3:00:11.180]  is now the biggest pop star one of the biggest pop stars out there in the top
[3:00:11.180 --> 3:00:16.620]  three saying Kim trails over the country club here it is another example is the
[3:00:16.620 --> 3:00:21.580]  array of technologies often referred to collectively as geo engineering that
[3:00:21.580 --> 3:00:25.020]  potentially could help reverse the warming effects of global climate change
[3:00:25.020 --> 3:00:29.340]  one that has gained my personal attention is stratospheric aerosol
[3:00:29.340 --> 3:00:34.820]  injection or s AI a method of seeding the stratosphere with particles that can
[3:00:34.820 --> 3:00:49.100]  help reflect the sun's heat and much the same way that volcanic eruptions
[3:01:04.820 --> 3:01:20.260]  I take out your dirt course and all of your juice go to the market the kids
[3:01:20.260 --> 3:01:33.180]  swimming baby what's your sign my margin Leo my cancer is you won't play you
[3:01:33.180 --> 3:01:45.380]  well I don't care what they think drag racing my little red sports car not
[3:01:45.380 --> 3:02:06.140]  on him or unhappy I'm just with you my sweet but there's nothing more contemplating
[3:02:06.140 --> 3:02:16.340]  our jewels in the swimming pool me and my sister just playing it cool under the
[3:02:16.340 --> 3:02:36.620]  fire meet you for coffee at the elementary school we laugh about nothing this summer gets cool it's beautiful
[3:02:36.620 --> 3:02:46.300]  of you
[3:03:06.620 --> 3:03:27.420]  There it is, the Smithsonian, airplane contrails may be creating artificial geoengineering,
[3:03:27.420 --> 3:03:34.260]  dissipating haze from plane exhaust, bingo, alters how sunlight reaches the earth and
[3:03:34.260 --> 3:03:36.460]  may be unintentionally affecting our climate.
[3:04:04.260 --> 3:04:34.220]  It's never too late, baby, so don't give up, oh, it's never too late, baby,
[3:04:34.220 --> 3:04:53.700]  so don't give up, oh, it's never too late, baby, so don't give up, oh, it's never too late,
[3:04:53.700 --> 3:04:59.700]  I can't tell you, son, that my leader was wrong
[3:04:59.700 --> 3:05:16.700]  I can't tell you, son, that my leader was wrong
[3:05:16.700 --> 3:05:27.700]  So they're at the country club, they're being molested as children
[3:05:28.700 --> 3:05:32.700]  And the men that run the country club are spraying the atmosphere blacking out the sky
[3:05:33.700 --> 3:05:37.700]  But it's okay, they go back to sleep during the day and it's alright, they just get abused at night
[3:05:38.700 --> 3:05:41.700]  And so they're externalizing the method of the whole thing, let's pull it up
[3:05:41.700 --> 3:05:44.700]  It's at man.video, it's an augmented version
[3:05:45.700 --> 3:05:51.700]  Lana Del Rey, Kim Trails over the country club, augmented by infowars.com
[3:05:52.700 --> 3:05:57.700]  With four giant views, just went live seconds ago at band.video
[3:05:58.700 --> 3:06:04.700]  There you go, with the former CIA director admitting it all, but they say it doesn't exist
[3:06:04.700 --> 3:06:10.700]  As the level of aluminum goes up at the soil levels where they can't even grow crops anymore
[3:06:11.700 --> 3:06:15.700]  But don't worry, Bill Gates is minable of farmland and he's got seeds that can grow in aluminum
[3:06:16.700 --> 3:06:20.700]  What a nice man, and he's got a shot for you, it's gonna make you real sick, but it's okay
[3:06:21.700 --> 3:06:22.700]  He's Dr. Bill Gates
[3:06:23.700 --> 3:06:26.700]  Alright, a good friend of mine and a great patriot, Dr. Nick Baggage takes over
[3:06:27.700 --> 3:06:28.700]  In T-minus four minutes on the other side
[3:06:28.700 --> 3:06:33.700]  Thank you all, God bless, and good luck

[3:07:07.700 --> 3:07:10.700]  But Soros and Bill Gates and the globalists are on our tail
[3:07:11.700 --> 3:07:13.700]  But the new website is
[3:07:14.700 --> 3:07:17.700]  TheResistance.video
[3:07:18.700 --> 3:07:21.700]  They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can defeat them
[3:07:22.700 --> 3:07:25.700]  So the new URL that links right to band.video and all of our videos
[3:07:25.700 --> 3:07:29.700]  And all of our documentaries and all the special reports and all the suppressed information
[3:07:30.700 --> 3:07:32.700]  Is at TheResistance.video
[3:07:33.700 --> 3:07:36.700]  Share the link to TheResistance.video
[3:07:37.700 --> 3:07:40.700]  Fox has betrayed President Trump as I predicted they would
[3:07:41.700 --> 3:07:44.700]  They've always been part of the establishment and it's only going to get worse
[3:07:45.700 --> 3:07:50.700]  If they're able to keep Trump from rightfully taking office for second term on January 20th
[3:07:50.700 --> 3:07:54.700]  The system is going to drop the hammer harder than ever on this republic
[3:07:55.700 --> 3:07:58.700]  They are going to explode gas prices, they're going to shut down our coal power plants
[3:07:59.700 --> 3:08:00.700]  They're going to cut off the energy source to the US
[3:08:01.700 --> 3:08:03.700]  So it's impossible for factories to move back here
[3:08:04.700 --> 3:08:06.700]  This is economic domination, this is economic war
[3:08:07.700 --> 3:08:08.700]  We are being consolidated, we are being taken over
[3:08:09.700 --> 3:08:11.700]  The Democrats aren't mismanaging their blue cities and states
[3:08:12.700 --> 3:08:17.700]  They're consolidating power and control to bankrupt the population and bring them absolutely to heal
[3:08:17.700 --> 3:08:20.700]  And then consolidate ownership of all the infrastructure and property
[3:08:21.700 --> 3:08:24.700]  This is a monopolistic takeover, that's what the great reset is
[3:08:25.700 --> 3:08:27.700]  Cloud swab and these other criminals admit it
[3:08:28.700 --> 3:08:30.700]  That's what social distancing is, so your business is only at 25%
[3:08:31.700 --> 3:08:34.700]  For several more years, no small businesses will be there
[3:08:34.700 --> 3:08:47.700]  This is a master plan, say no
[3:09:04.700 --> 3:09:12.700]  Welcome back and I'm really, really glad to be here today
[3:09:13.700 --> 3:09:16.700]  We're right in the middle of walking through hell and nobody needs to stop now
[3:09:17.700 --> 3:09:19.700]  It's a wrong stop to make along the train of life
[3:09:20.700 --> 3:09:23.700]  But I do have a really important message today
[3:09:24.700 --> 3:09:27.700]  I really appreciate where the last couple of hours have been
[3:09:28.700 --> 3:09:31.700]  Because it really brings us right to where I want to be right now
[3:09:31.700 --> 3:09:36.700]  In this conversation with 2 million people that are listening right now
[3:09:37.700 --> 3:09:39.700]  That are in this conversation with Alex and I right now
[3:09:40.700 --> 3:09:42.700]  In a way that Alex gets a little differently from something I said
[3:09:43.700 --> 3:09:44.700]  And I'm not getting into that
[3:09:45.700 --> 3:09:50.700]  But I got to tell you, we're in this conversation on Alex's
[3:09:51.700 --> 3:09:52.700]  Metaphysical level sometimes
[3:09:53.700 --> 3:09:55.700]  And we can use that word too, I like that word
[3:09:55.700 --> 3:10:00.700]  And listening to Quayle, you know, I worked with him years and years ago
[3:10:01.700 --> 3:10:04.700]  As a guest, talking about all that technology, you see
[3:10:05.700 --> 3:10:09.700]  Because where I brought my truth through was to the not whole of science, you see
[3:10:10.700 --> 3:10:12.700]  And one of my friends who just passed away
[3:10:13.700 --> 3:10:14.700]  I got a graphic book, sorry for going out of the frame
[3:10:15.700 --> 3:10:17.700]  But Elizabeth Rauscher, she was a triple PhD
[3:10:18.700 --> 3:10:19.700]  I've talked about her in the past as a reference
[3:10:20.700 --> 3:10:21.700]  And she wrote a few books
[3:10:21.700 --> 3:10:24.700]  She wrote the holographic, anthropic, multiverse
[3:10:25.700 --> 3:10:27.700]  Formalizing the concept of geometry and reality
[3:10:28.700 --> 3:10:31.700]  She was a triple PhD in physics, astrophysics, biophysics, geophysics
[3:10:32.700 --> 3:10:33.700]  And then she wrote orbiting the moons of Pluto
[3:10:34.700 --> 3:10:38.700]  Complex solutions to Einstein, Maxwell, Schrodinger, and Dirac's equation
[3:10:39.700 --> 3:10:40.700]  And that deals with reality
[3:10:41.700 --> 3:10:42.700]  And then the last one I'll mention
[3:10:43.700 --> 3:10:44.700]  And these are all academic books, you won't find them on the shelf
[3:10:45.700 --> 3:10:46.700]  And they're all in math
[3:10:47.700 --> 3:10:48.700]  The other one is mind dynamics
[3:10:48.700 --> 3:10:52.700]  Inside space and time, a physicist's exploration of the nature and properties of consciousness
[3:10:53.700 --> 3:10:57.700]  Okay, we were great friends all the way up until her passing
[3:10:58.700 --> 3:11:00.700]  And I spent days with her at a time
[3:11:01.700 --> 3:11:03.700]  And what she wanted me to do was co-author a book about consciousness
[3:11:04.700 --> 3:11:06.700]  In reality, I felt unqualified and I said no
[3:11:07.700 --> 3:11:08.700]  And I didn't do it
[3:11:09.700 --> 3:11:10.700]  And she's gone now, she passed away
[3:11:11.700 --> 3:11:13.700]  And what I failed, I failed so miserably in that
[3:11:14.700 --> 3:11:15.700]  Missing the opportunity God gave me
[3:11:15.700 --> 3:11:18.700]  Because people, every one of us, need to hear
[3:11:19.700 --> 3:11:21.700]  What does reality really look like
[3:11:22.700 --> 3:11:24.700]  And how can we understand it without the math
[3:11:25.700 --> 3:11:26.700]  And see, I put that in words
[3:11:27.700 --> 3:11:28.700]  And that's what she wanted me to do with her math
[3:11:29.700 --> 3:11:31.700]  Was put her math in words so I could paint a picture
[3:11:32.700 --> 3:11:33.700]  For the world to see this math
[3:11:34.700 --> 3:11:35.700]  That could create a new reality
[3:11:36.700 --> 3:11:37.700]  Because if you can get into the math
[3:11:38.700 --> 3:11:39.700]  And we can't, because I don't do that math
[3:11:40.700 --> 3:11:42.700]  But I came into the knowing
[3:11:42.700 --> 3:11:44.700]  A different path
[3:11:45.700 --> 3:11:48.700]  That's the only difference between her as a physicist
[3:11:49.700 --> 3:11:50.700]  And me as someone else
[3:11:51.700 --> 3:11:53.700]  A different path to the same finish line
[3:11:54.700 --> 3:11:55.700]  The path of math
[3:11:56.700 --> 3:11:57.700]  Wow, that's complicated
[3:11:58.700 --> 3:11:59.700]  All right
[3:12:00.700 --> 3:12:01.700]  Now, I found in this last week
[3:12:02.700 --> 3:12:03.700]  The mind effects conference
[3:12:04.700 --> 3:12:05.700]  The closed conference
[3:12:06.700 --> 3:12:07.700]  No one got to come
[3:12:08.700 --> 3:12:09.700]  All the videos that were taken
[3:12:09.700 --> 3:12:10.700]  Very powerful information
[3:12:11.700 --> 3:12:12.700]  That we're going to get to get out
[3:12:13.700 --> 3:12:14.700]  And there's Elizabeth in the frame
[3:12:15.700 --> 3:12:16.700]  And I was their keynote speaker
[3:12:17.700 --> 3:12:20.700]  In the last consciousness event that she went to
[3:12:21.700 --> 3:12:22.700]  And it was on, it was like the 38th
[3:12:23.700 --> 3:12:24.700]  Or 39th, I can't remember
[3:12:25.700 --> 3:12:26.700]  But it was the Psychotronics Association
[3:12:27.700 --> 3:12:28.700]  Where people figure out what's going on in the mind
[3:12:29.700 --> 3:12:30.700]  And try and figure out what's going on in the world
[3:12:31.700 --> 3:12:32.700]  Reality creation kind of stuff
[3:12:33.700 --> 3:12:34.700]  That's been my whole life
[3:12:35.700 --> 3:12:36.700]  As a little kid, I started thinking
[3:12:36.700 --> 3:12:38.700]  That this in life has come so clear
[3:12:39.700 --> 3:12:40.700]  So absolutely clear lately
[3:12:41.700 --> 3:12:42.700]  And this is me, I asked my mom
[3:12:43.700 --> 3:12:44.700]  Send me some pictures of when I was a little kid
[3:12:45.700 --> 3:12:46.700]  About two
[3:12:47.700 --> 3:12:48.700]  When I was still holding the hand of God
[3:12:49.700 --> 3:12:50.700]  And knew it as a two-year-old
[3:12:51.700 --> 3:12:52.700]  So I was closer to him
[3:12:53.700 --> 3:12:54.700]  And my vocal cords hadn't even developed enough
[3:12:55.700 --> 3:12:56.700]  To have a conversation
[3:12:57.700 --> 3:12:58.700]  Except the inner conversation I always had with God
[3:12:59.700 --> 3:13:00.700]  And then as I grew into the world
[3:13:01.700 --> 3:13:02.700]  Like everyone else
[3:13:03.700 --> 3:13:04.700]  I lost that conversation somehow
[3:13:04.700 --> 3:13:05.700]  And this is the problem
[3:13:06.700 --> 3:13:07.700]  See, it's how we see the world
[3:13:08.700 --> 3:13:09.700]  That's been my motto
[3:13:10.700 --> 3:13:11.700]  Information in a different way
[3:13:12.700 --> 3:13:13.700]  Changed the way we see the world
[3:13:14.700 --> 3:13:15.700]  So I coupled up with the info war
[3:13:17.700 --> 3:13:18.700]  Three years ago in a different way
[3:13:19.700 --> 3:13:20.700]  Because I came to Austin
[3:13:21.700 --> 3:13:22.700]  I said, hey, I want to reformulate what I'm doing
[3:13:23.700 --> 3:13:24.700]  Because I need to get the content out
[3:13:25.700 --> 3:13:26.700]  I'm a hundred hours behind
[3:13:27.700 --> 3:13:28.700]  I'm so frustrated in that
[3:13:29.700 --> 3:13:30.700]  I can't tell you because
[3:13:31.700 --> 3:13:32.700]  I didn't do what Alex did
[3:13:32.700 --> 3:13:33.700]  I was the first to play in this
[3:13:34.700 --> 3:13:35.700]  Weird kind of maze we're in
[3:13:36.700 --> 3:13:37.700]  He created all this structure
[3:13:38.700 --> 3:13:39.700]  That requires all this noise
[3:13:40.700 --> 3:13:41.700]  And all this racket
[3:13:42.700 --> 3:13:43.700]  People always go, hey, pass this on to Alex
[3:13:44.700 --> 3:13:45.700]  Pass that on to Alex
[3:13:46.700 --> 3:13:47.700]  Hey, he is following a mission
[3:13:48.700 --> 3:13:49.700]  And a plan that is so complicated
[3:13:50.700 --> 3:13:51.700]  No one can understand it, but Alex
[3:13:52.700 --> 3:13:53.700]  But you can give him a breath of life
[3:13:54.700 --> 3:13:55.700]  And don't expect him to always
[3:13:56.700 --> 3:13:57.700]  Respond to your individual message
[3:13:58.700 --> 3:13:59.700]  Or me, or any of us
[3:13:59.700 --> 3:14:01.700]  Hey, every wave put in the pond
[3:14:02.700 --> 3:14:03.700]  Of a direction that changes where we go
[3:14:04.700 --> 3:14:05.700]  Is the right one
[3:14:06.700 --> 3:14:07.700]  Do your part, don't judge whether he heard it
[3:14:08.700 --> 3:14:09.700]  Didn't hear it, whether you did the right thing
[3:14:10.700 --> 3:14:11.700]  That's not your judgment
[3:14:12.700 --> 3:14:13.700]  There's only two witnesses in the world
[3:14:14.700 --> 3:14:15.700]  Two witnesses in the world
[3:14:16.700 --> 3:14:17.700]  To your life
[3:14:18.700 --> 3:14:19.700]  Yours and God
[3:14:20.700 --> 3:14:21.700]  Those are the two witnesses
[3:14:22.700 --> 3:14:23.700]  Whether you're doing it or not
[3:14:24.700 --> 3:14:25.700]  Forget about everyone else's judgment
[3:14:26.700 --> 3:14:27.700]  You may see me going through hell
[3:14:27.700 --> 3:14:28.700]  And I might be celebrating that
[3:14:29.700 --> 3:14:30.700]  Because it's not held to me
[3:14:31.700 --> 3:14:32.700]  And I can't make that any more clear
[3:14:33.700 --> 3:14:34.700]  And I'm not going to have enough time
[3:14:35.700 --> 3:14:36.700]  In this hour to do it in a coherent way
[3:14:37.700 --> 3:14:38.700]  So you've got to go backwards
[3:14:39.700 --> 3:14:40.700]  And look at all the old videos
[3:14:41.700 --> 3:14:42.700]  A lot of people don't know
[3:14:43.700 --> 3:14:44.700]  I go through crisis just like you
[3:14:45.700 --> 3:14:46.700]  So does Alex every day
[3:14:47.700 --> 3:14:48.700]  But we come here and we deliver
[3:14:49.700 --> 3:14:50.700]  What we know, because it's our gift
[3:14:51.700 --> 3:14:52.700]  And we're happy to do it
[3:14:53.700 --> 3:14:54.700]  And we do it with a lot of joy
[3:14:54.700 --> 3:14:56.700]  And I want to accept before the hour is up today
[3:14:57.700 --> 3:14:58.700]  About being born again
[3:14:59.700 --> 3:15:00.700]  I want to talk about the church in the world
[3:15:01.700 --> 3:15:02.700]  As I see it
[3:15:03.700 --> 3:15:04.700]  And I want to talk a little bit about
[3:15:05.700 --> 3:15:06.700]  What Christians call your testimony
[3:15:07.700 --> 3:15:08.700]  And I don't like the way that's framed
[3:15:09.700 --> 3:15:10.700]  In a lot of ways in the past
[3:15:11.700 --> 3:15:12.700]  As I referenced it
[3:15:13.700 --> 3:15:14.700]  And the word prayer, what that means
[3:15:15.700 --> 3:15:16.700]  I want to explore that more
[3:15:17.700 --> 3:15:18.700]  Because I think we have a false narrative
[3:15:19.700 --> 3:15:20.700]  Going on that's been taught to us by a church
[3:15:21.700 --> 3:15:22.700]  That maybe needs a little bit of scrutiny
[3:15:22.700 --> 3:15:23.700]  A lot of scrutiny in fact
[3:15:24.700 --> 3:15:26.700]  But the true temple of God is your body
[3:15:27.700 --> 3:15:28.700]  Look it up
[3:15:29.700 --> 3:15:30.700]  Christ said it
[3:15:31.700 --> 3:15:32.700]  You're the temple
[3:15:33.700 --> 3:15:34.700]  That's the structure of the church
[3:15:35.700 --> 3:15:36.700]  Not a building down the block
[3:15:37.700 --> 3:15:38.700]  It's you
[3:15:39.700 --> 3:15:40.700]  You're it
[3:15:41.700 --> 3:15:42.700]  You're it
[3:15:43.700 --> 3:15:44.700]  The image and lightness of God
[3:15:45.700 --> 3:15:46.700]  If you can turn that on in the right way
[3:15:47.700 --> 3:15:48.700]  Get reoriented in the right way
[3:15:49.700 --> 3:15:50.700]  So I want to talk about what that means
[3:15:50.700 --> 3:15:51.700]  In the context of my own life experience
[3:15:52.700 --> 3:15:53.700]  Because that's the only thing that matters
[3:15:54.700 --> 3:15:55.700]  My path is my own
[3:15:56.700 --> 3:15:57.700]  Not yours to share
[3:15:58.700 --> 3:15:59.700]  But yours to observe
[3:16:00.700 --> 3:16:01.700]  And that's called a witness
[3:16:02.700 --> 3:16:03.700]  It's not knocking on some door
[3:16:04.700 --> 3:16:05.700]  And kicking it in of your neighbor
[3:16:06.700 --> 3:16:07.700]  And intruding in the most sacred part of their life
[3:16:08.700 --> 3:16:09.700]  Their relationship with God
[3:16:10.700 --> 3:16:11.700]  And making assumptions about what that might look like
[3:16:12.700 --> 3:16:13.700]  Because the first assumption you make
[3:16:14.700 --> 3:16:15.700]  When you knock on that door
[3:16:16.700 --> 3:16:17.700]  Is they don't know what you know
[3:16:17.700 --> 3:16:19.700]  That's a big judgment to make in my view of the world
[3:16:20.700 --> 3:16:21.700]  I would prefer to be an example of something
[3:16:22.700 --> 3:16:23.700]  And not mention my faith
[3:16:24.700 --> 3:16:25.700]  And let them see it
[3:16:26.700 --> 3:16:27.700]  Radiate from me in the actions I live
[3:16:28.700 --> 3:16:29.700]  That's a witness
[3:16:30.700 --> 3:16:31.700]  That's what witnessing means
[3:16:32.700 --> 3:16:33.700]  I want to give that new meaning
[3:16:34.700 --> 3:16:35.700]  Is how you live your life
[3:16:36.700 --> 3:16:37.700]  How you express yourself in the world
[3:16:38.700 --> 3:16:39.700]  How the image and lightness of God
[3:16:40.700 --> 3:16:41.700]  Created in you expresses itself in the world
[3:16:42.700 --> 3:16:43.700]  In your own very unique way
[3:16:44.700 --> 3:16:45.700]  That usually involves a
[3:16:45.700 --> 3:16:46.700]  Crap load of trauma
[3:16:47.700 --> 3:16:48.700]  Mine has
[3:16:49.700 --> 3:16:50.700]  And anyone that's doing anything
[3:16:51.700 --> 3:16:52.700]  All of you have
[3:16:53.700 --> 3:16:54.700]  Because we all have a roadmap to trauma
[3:16:55.700 --> 3:16:56.700]  So what does it mean to lift the trauma
[3:16:57.700 --> 3:16:58.700]  That you experience
[3:16:59.700 --> 3:17:00.700]  So you see it differently
[3:17:01.700 --> 3:17:02.700]  So when you see me going through hell
[3:17:03.700 --> 3:17:04.700]  And I'm not
[3:17:05.700 --> 3:17:06.700]  And I could give you examples
[3:17:07.700 --> 3:17:08.700]  We may not have time to do that today
[3:17:09.700 --> 3:17:10.700]  But I'm going to get caught up
[3:17:11.700 --> 3:17:12.700]  I'm going to get that 100 hours
[3:17:12.700 --> 3:17:14.700]  And you can sort it out against the background
[3:17:15.700 --> 3:17:16.700]  Of your own heart and truth
[3:17:17.700 --> 3:17:18.700]  And throw it on the ground if you like
[3:17:19.700 --> 3:17:20.700]  Or let it echo in the chambers of your soul
[3:17:21.700 --> 3:17:22.700]  And let it be filtered by the
[3:17:23.700 --> 3:17:24.700]  By the wisdom of God
[3:17:25.700 --> 3:17:26.700]  In you whether you know it or not
[3:17:27.700 --> 3:17:28.700]  And I've got a great show today
[3:17:29.700 --> 3:17:30.700]  This is Dr. Nick Begich
[3:17:35.700 --> 3:17:36.700]  I want to warn all patriots
[3:17:37.700 --> 3:17:38.700]  In the United States
[3:17:39.700 --> 3:17:40.700]  And across the world
[3:17:40.700 --> 3:17:41.700]  I'm Alex Jones
[3:17:42.700 --> 3:17:43.700]  I've been in this fight 27 years
[3:17:44.700 --> 3:17:45.700]  And I've studied every angle of their operations
[3:17:46.700 --> 3:17:47.700]  And I am here to tell you
[3:17:48.700 --> 3:17:49.700]  As clear as day
[3:17:50.700 --> 3:17:51.700]  They have organizations on message boards
[3:17:52.700 --> 3:17:53.700]  And other groups
[3:17:54.700 --> 3:17:55.700]  Posing as patriot leaders
[3:17:56.700 --> 3:17:57.700]  And posing as President Trump
[3:17:58.700 --> 3:17:59.700]  Anonymously telling you to have arm marches
[3:18:00.700 --> 3:18:01.700]  In all 50 states
[3:18:02.700 --> 3:18:03.700]  Coming up on the 20th and before that
[3:18:04.700 --> 3:18:05.700]  You are being set up
[3:18:06.700 --> 3:18:07.700]  I was there in D.C.
[3:18:07.700 --> 3:18:09.700]  As a peaceful people
[3:18:10.700 --> 3:18:11.700]  And I watched Antifa and other leftist groups
[3:18:12.700 --> 3:18:13.700]  Poses our people and set us up
[3:18:14.700 --> 3:18:15.700]  Thank God the patriots did not engage in the rioting
[3:18:16.700 --> 3:18:17.700]  So only a few people did it
[3:18:18.700 --> 3:18:19.700]  So the thing was a misfire
[3:18:20.700 --> 3:18:21.700]  It was a dud
[3:18:22.700 --> 3:18:23.700]  But the left is hungry to declare
[3:18:24.700 --> 3:18:25.700]  All Trump supporters terrorist
[3:18:26.700 --> 3:18:27.700]  And they're planning terrorist attacks
[3:18:28.700 --> 3:18:29.700]  And mass shootings on the 20th
[3:18:30.700 --> 3:18:31.700]  To blame the American people
[3:18:32.700 --> 3:18:33.700]  Do not be part of it
[3:18:34.700 --> 3:18:35.700]  We are peaceful
[3:18:35.700 --> 3:18:36.700]  Now is the time to get prepared
[3:18:37.700 --> 3:18:38.700]  You got to pray to God
[3:18:39.700 --> 3:18:40.700]  And get your soul ready
[3:18:41.700 --> 3:18:42.700]  You got to be prepared to physically defend yourself
[3:18:43.700 --> 3:18:44.700]  And your family
[3:18:45.700 --> 3:18:46.700]  And you've also got to get things that allow you
[3:18:47.700 --> 3:18:48.700]  And your family to not be dependent on the system
[3:18:49.700 --> 3:18:50.700]  That's why they want to bankrupt the economy
[3:18:51.700 --> 3:18:52.700]  It's why they want to destroy the infrastructure
[3:18:53.700 --> 3:18:54.700]  Of this nation
[3:18:55.700 --> 3:18:56.700]  Because they want all of us on our knees
[3:18:57.700 --> 3:18:58.700]  So they can dictate our surrender to them
[3:18:59.700 --> 3:19:00.700]  Imple Wars
[3:19:01.700 --> 3:19:02.700]  Is a critical organization
[3:19:02.700 --> 3:19:03.700]  And the fight against the globalist
[3:19:04.700 --> 3:19:05.700]  And if you gave us straight up donations
[3:19:06.700 --> 3:19:07.700]  That would be great
[3:19:08.700 --> 3:19:09.700]  Because our work is important
[3:19:10.700 --> 3:19:11.700]  We appreciate it
[3:19:12.700 --> 3:19:13.700]  But we bring you great products
[3:19:14.700 --> 3:19:15.700]  So that you get high quality products

[3:19:37.700 --> 3:19:38.700]  The Post Industrial World
[3:19:39.700 --> 3:19:40.700]  That's what George Herbert Walker Bush
[3:19:41.700 --> 3:19:42.700]  Signed on to at the Rio de Janeiro
[3:19:43.700 --> 3:19:44.700]  Agenda 21 conference
[3:19:45.700 --> 3:19:46.700]  Back in 1992
[3:19:47.700 --> 3:19:48.700]  Now they've launched the agenda
[3:19:49.700 --> 3:19:50.700]  2030 which is a post
[3:19:51.700 --> 3:19:52.700]  Industrial World
[3:19:53.700 --> 3:19:54.700]  Plou Schwab with the Davos Group
[3:19:55.700 --> 3:19:56.700]  Trudeau the Prime Minister and Piano
[3:19:56.700 --> 3:19:58.700]  The Great Reset is Agenda 2030
[3:19:59.700 --> 3:20:00.700]  Well you might want to find out
[3:20:01.700 --> 3:20:02.700]  What Agenda 2030 is
[3:20:03.700 --> 3:20:04.700]  It is the destruction
[3:20:05.700 --> 3:20:06.700]  Of society as we know it
[3:20:07.700 --> 3:20:08.700]  It is making the population poor
[3:20:09.700 --> 3:20:10.700]  By designs we can be controlled
[3:20:11.700 --> 3:20:12.700]  With a medical
[3:20:13.700 --> 3:20:14.700]  Technocracy over you and your family
[3:20:15.700 --> 3:20:16.700]  They're destroying civilization
[3:20:17.700 --> 3:20:18.700]  Rebuild it in their dystopic
[3:20:19.700 --> 3:20:20.700]  Image
[3:20:21.700 --> 3:20:22.700]  We are fighting this

[3:20:36.700 --> 3:20:37.700]  At ImpleWars.com
[3:20:38.700 --> 3:20:40.700]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show
[3:20:51.700 --> 3:20:52.700]  Live from Austin, Texas
[3:20:52.700 --> 3:20:53.700]  Broadcasting worldwide
[3:20:54.700 --> 3:20:55.700]  It's Alex Jones
[3:20:56.700 --> 3:20:58.700]  And now your host
[3:20:59.700 --> 3:21:00.700]  Nick Baggage
[3:21:04.700 --> 3:21:05.700]  And welcome back
[3:21:06.700 --> 3:21:07.700]  You know I want to jump right into this
[3:21:08.700 --> 3:21:09.700]  Because I just defined witnessing
[3:21:10.700 --> 3:21:11.700]  In a different way
[3:21:12.700 --> 3:21:13.700]  I'm sure for a lot of people
[3:21:14.700 --> 3:21:15.700]  Testimony, what is testimony?
[3:21:16.700 --> 3:21:17.700]  It's not what you say with your mouth
[3:21:18.700 --> 3:21:19.700]  It's what you do with your life
[3:21:19.700 --> 3:21:21.700]  It's what you are by your experience
[3:21:22.700 --> 3:21:23.700]  It doesn't matter what you say
[3:21:24.700 --> 3:21:25.700]  How many people say stuff and don't do stuff
[3:21:26.700 --> 3:21:27.700]  It doesn't matter what you say
[3:21:28.700 --> 3:21:29.700]  If it's not lined up with what you do
[3:21:30.700 --> 3:21:31.700]  So what you do ought to then be obvious
[3:21:32.700 --> 3:21:33.700]  So you don't have to say anything
[3:21:34.700 --> 3:21:35.700]  That's called testimony by your witness
[3:21:36.700 --> 3:21:37.700]  I mean this is just a little different way to look at it
[3:21:38.700 --> 3:21:39.700]  Prayer
[3:21:40.700 --> 3:21:41.700]  Most people think of prayer
[3:21:42.700 --> 3:21:43.700]  Another word I want to redefine just a little bit
[3:21:44.700 --> 3:21:45.700]  Not really redefine
[3:21:46.700 --> 3:21:47.700]  Just get a little deeper with
[3:21:47.700 --> 3:21:48.700]  Pray
[3:21:49.700 --> 3:21:50.700]  God help help help
[3:21:51.700 --> 3:21:52.700]  Do whatever
[3:21:53.700 --> 3:21:54.700]  No that's not what prayer is
[3:21:55.700 --> 3:21:56.700]  Prayer is revealing your heart
[3:21:57.700 --> 3:21:58.700]  In a conversation with your friend
[3:21:59.700 --> 3:22:00.700]  Who cares about you
[3:22:01.700 --> 3:22:02.700]  Who wants you back in the garden
[3:22:04.700 --> 3:22:05.700]  As a parent
[3:22:06.700 --> 3:22:07.700]  Would want his son in the garden
[3:22:08.700 --> 3:22:09.700]  With him
[3:22:10.700 --> 3:22:11.700]  Think about this for just a moment
[3:22:12.700 --> 3:22:13.700]  Now I want to take it from two dimensions
[3:22:14.700 --> 3:22:15.700]  How did God feel
[3:22:15.700 --> 3:22:16.700]  What did he experience
[3:22:17.700 --> 3:22:18.700]  In the garden
[3:22:19.700 --> 3:22:20.700]  And what did maybe Adam and Eve
[3:22:21.700 --> 3:22:22.700]  Experience that
[3:22:23.700 --> 3:22:24.700]  It's impossible for us to fully see that
[3:22:25.700 --> 3:22:26.700]  But maybe we can just try and
[3:22:27.700 --> 3:22:28.700]  Feel that a bit in our heart
[3:22:29.700 --> 3:22:30.700]  Because that's where it's going to be felt
[3:22:31.700 --> 3:22:32.700]  And known, understood it in the world
[3:22:33.700 --> 3:22:34.700]  Because you're not going to do it in your head
[3:22:35.700 --> 3:22:36.700]  Because you don't have any experience
[3:22:37.700 --> 3:22:38.700]  Hooked up to it in the same way
[3:22:39.700 --> 3:22:40.700]  So think about this
[3:22:41.700 --> 3:22:42.700]  You're in the garden
[3:22:42.700 --> 3:22:44.700]  Because you're a co-creator with God
[3:22:45.700 --> 3:22:46.700]  In that garden, creating image and likeness
[3:22:47.700 --> 3:22:48.700]  Now imagine
[3:22:49.700 --> 3:22:50.700]  And you even fathom
[3:22:51.700 --> 3:22:52.700]  What you were learning to do
[3:22:54.700 --> 3:22:55.700]  Oh my goodness
[3:22:56.700 --> 3:22:57.700]  I mean, it just makes our
[3:22:58.700 --> 3:22:59.700]  Hair stand up, doesn't it
[3:23:00.700 --> 3:23:01.700]  When you contemplate that idea
[3:23:02.700 --> 3:23:03.700]  That concept of
[3:23:04.700 --> 3:23:05.700]  Being in communication
[3:23:06.700 --> 3:23:07.700]  With someone that cares for you
[3:23:08.700 --> 3:23:09.700]  As much as you do your children
[3:23:09.700 --> 3:23:11.700]  Wow, that's powerful, folks
[3:23:12.700 --> 3:23:13.700]  If you can feel it that way
[3:23:14.700 --> 3:23:15.700]  As God wants you to
[3:23:16.700 --> 3:23:17.700]  Because that's really deep love, you see
[3:23:18.700 --> 3:23:19.700]  Deeper than we can even feel for our own children
[3:23:20.700 --> 3:23:21.700]  Even for ourselves, for anything
[3:23:22.700 --> 3:23:23.700]  It's a really deep thing
[3:23:24.700 --> 3:23:25.700]  And in that depth
[3:23:27.700 --> 3:23:28.700]  Is where we get born again, you see
[3:23:30.700 --> 3:23:31.700]  It's not so complicated
[3:23:32.700 --> 3:23:33.700]  To start the mission
[3:23:34.700 --> 3:23:35.700]  Of finding what we are again
[3:23:36.700 --> 3:23:37.700]  Because what God has always been about
[3:23:37.700 --> 3:23:38.700]  Now think about this too
[3:23:39.700 --> 3:23:40.700]  As your child rebels
[3:23:41.700 --> 3:23:42.700]  And I had one that rebelled horrible
[3:23:43.700 --> 3:23:44.700]  And I mean really horribly
[3:23:45.700 --> 3:23:46.700]  I'm raising my youngest son
[3:23:48.700 --> 3:23:49.700]  I'm raising my granddaughter
[3:23:50.700 --> 3:23:51.700]  She's now 14
[3:23:52.700 --> 3:23:53.700]  I have four more years of that 18-year commitment
[3:23:54.700 --> 3:23:56.700]  And so we all experience a lot of things
[3:23:58.700 --> 3:23:59.700]  And we all have wayward sons too
[3:24:00.700 --> 3:24:01.700]  And others that we're very, very proud of
[3:24:02.700 --> 3:24:03.700]  My eldest son is totally different
[3:24:04.700 --> 3:24:05.700]  But I'm proud of them both
[3:24:05.700 --> 3:24:06.700]  And the fact that I know is
[3:24:07.700 --> 3:24:08.700]  My suffering as my youngest
[3:24:09.700 --> 3:24:10.700]  Is going through right now
[3:24:11.700 --> 3:24:12.700]  And he may not live another year
[3:24:14.700 --> 3:24:15.700]  It's his path somehow
[3:24:16.700 --> 3:24:18.700]  And I can see that in it
[3:24:19.700 --> 3:24:20.700]  Somehow
[3:24:21.700 --> 3:24:22.700]  And be released to the burden
[3:24:23.700 --> 3:24:24.700]  Of knowing that deeply
[3:24:25.700 --> 3:24:26.700]  As my son
[3:24:27.700 --> 3:24:28.700]  So think how God felt
[3:24:29.700 --> 3:24:30.700]  When Adam and Eve
[3:24:31.700 --> 3:24:32.700]  Separated themselves from God
[3:24:32.700 --> 3:24:33.700]  That's a deep feeling too
[3:24:35.700 --> 3:24:36.700]  That resonates
[3:24:39.700 --> 3:24:40.700]  Through our living experience
[3:24:42.700 --> 3:24:43.700]  Which is what we are born into
[3:24:44.700 --> 3:24:45.700]  When we first come here
[3:24:46.700 --> 3:24:47.700]  When we're young and little
[3:24:48.700 --> 3:24:49.700]  And can't talk
[3:24:50.700 --> 3:24:51.700]  Because our vocal cords haven't developed
[3:24:52.700 --> 3:24:53.700]  And our brains are still running
[3:24:54.700 --> 3:24:55.700]  In a pattern that somehow
[3:24:56.700 --> 3:24:57.700]  Keeps us linked
[3:24:58.700 --> 3:24:59.700]  To the essence of what we are
[3:24:59.700 --> 3:25:00.700]  In a different way
[3:25:01.700 --> 3:25:02.700]  And I asked my mom a few years ago
[3:25:03.700 --> 3:25:04.700]  Send me some pictures
[3:25:05.700 --> 3:25:06.700]  That really say something about
[3:25:07.700 --> 3:25:08.700]  Who I am from a mother's perspective
[3:25:09.700 --> 3:25:10.700]  And this is one of them
[3:25:11.700 --> 3:25:12.700]  This is one that resonates with me
[3:25:13.700 --> 3:25:14.700]  And it's me at two
[3:25:15.700 --> 3:25:16.700]  With a stack of books on my lap
[3:25:17.700 --> 3:25:18.700]  Reading
[3:25:20.700 --> 3:25:21.700]  Okay, that's a funny image
[3:25:22.700 --> 3:25:23.700]  I know it's a funny image
[3:25:24.700 --> 3:25:25.700]  But I'm a scholar
[3:25:26.700 --> 3:25:27.700]  In all these closed cabinets or books
[3:25:27.700 --> 3:25:28.700]  In the center of what I've read
[3:25:29.700 --> 3:25:30.700]  And there's a lot of books there
[3:25:31.700 --> 3:25:33.700]  And as a person living in my head
[3:25:34.700 --> 3:25:35.700]  So much of my life
[3:25:36.700 --> 3:25:37.700]  To find God in my heart
[3:25:38.700 --> 3:25:39.700]  Was a really difficult journey
[3:25:40.700 --> 3:25:41.700]  And I'll tell you a little piece of it
[3:25:42.700 --> 3:25:43.700]  It started in the Catholic church
[3:25:44.700 --> 3:25:45.700]  I was being raised a Catholic
[3:25:46.700 --> 3:25:47.700]  In my catechism at 12
[3:25:48.700 --> 3:25:49.700]  13 right around then
[3:25:50.700 --> 3:25:51.700]  Just before or just after
[3:25:52.700 --> 3:25:53.700]  My dad in fact had disappeared
[3:25:54.700 --> 3:25:55.700]  And I had consciously
[3:25:55.700 --> 3:25:56.700]  My heart
[3:25:57.700 --> 3:25:58.700]  And I didn't know it then
[3:25:59.700 --> 3:26:00.700]  In that way
[3:26:01.700 --> 3:26:02.700]  But I said no when they said
[3:26:03.700 --> 3:26:04.700]  Because where you're confirmed at that age
[3:26:05.700 --> 3:26:06.700]  Where you come into the church
[3:26:07.700 --> 3:26:08.700]  And say yes I believe
[3:26:09.700 --> 3:26:10.700]  I couldn't say that because I didn't
[3:26:11.700 --> 3:26:12.700]  And I was not going to lie
[3:26:13.700 --> 3:26:14.700]  To start out my relationship with God
[3:26:15.700 --> 3:26:16.700]  I wouldn't do it
[3:26:17.700 --> 3:26:18.700]  I had more integrity than that at 12 years old
[3:26:19.700 --> 3:26:20.700]  But the priest gets excited
[3:26:21.700 --> 3:26:22.700]  When you say no to that
[3:26:22.700 --> 3:26:24.700]  And then the washing machine works
[3:26:25.700 --> 3:26:26.700]  You say something that you really don't believe
[3:26:27.700 --> 3:26:28.700]  At that level that you need to
[3:26:29.700 --> 3:26:30.700]  And you go along
[3:26:31.700 --> 3:26:32.700]  Until you start repeating a lie
[3:26:33.700 --> 3:26:34.700]  And then everything that you filter
[3:26:35.700 --> 3:26:36.700]  Through that lie
[3:26:37.700 --> 3:26:38.700]  Is a life lived through a lie
[3:26:39.700 --> 3:26:40.700]  Can't do that
[3:26:41.700 --> 3:26:42.700]  You got to resonate back with your truth
[3:26:43.700 --> 3:26:44.700]  And if you don't know
[3:26:45.700 --> 3:26:46.700]  Don't feel lost and helpless in that
[3:26:47.700 --> 3:26:48.700]  That's okay any more than your two year old
[3:26:49.700 --> 3:26:50.700]  Because that's how God sees us
[3:26:50.700 --> 3:26:51.700]  And we interpret how many pathways
[3:26:52.700 --> 3:26:53.700]  Our life has taken
[3:26:54.700 --> 3:26:55.700]  And how we see it
[3:26:56.700 --> 3:26:57.700]  God still sees it as a two year old
[3:26:58.700 --> 3:26:59.700]  Same way you would
[3:27:00.700 --> 3:27:01.700]  In a loving nurturing way
[3:27:02.700 --> 3:27:03.700]  Will help you kind of nudge you
[3:27:04.700 --> 3:27:05.700]  And as you get to be a teenager
[3:27:06.700 --> 3:27:07.700]  They nudge less and let you make your own choices
[3:27:08.700 --> 3:27:09.700]  And fall and learn from those experiences
[3:27:10.700 --> 3:27:11.700]  That we call trauma
[3:27:12.700 --> 3:27:13.700]  And in those early days you might even curse God
[3:27:14.700 --> 3:27:15.700]  During those traumas not recognizing
[3:27:16.700 --> 3:27:17.700]  The depth of the lessons and suffering
[3:27:17.700 --> 3:27:19.700]  Of the Bible that confuses people
[3:27:20.700 --> 3:27:21.700]  And here my own life
[3:27:22.700 --> 3:27:23.700]  Is an example of it
[3:27:24.700 --> 3:27:25.700]  I've been crying for months
[3:27:26.700 --> 3:27:27.700]  And no one knows it
[3:27:28.700 --> 3:27:29.700]  Except God but not in sadness
[3:27:30.700 --> 3:27:31.700]  In gratitude
[3:27:32.700 --> 3:27:33.700]  Because when I do my 20 minutes of praying
[3:27:34.700 --> 3:27:35.700]  And I pray all day in and out
[3:27:36.700 --> 3:27:37.700]  But I do it now
[3:27:38.700 --> 3:27:39.700]  I speak it out
[3:27:40.700 --> 3:27:41.700]  Okay it makes you want to be around me
[3:27:42.700 --> 3:27:43.700]  Much you might think
[3:27:44.700 --> 3:27:45.700]  But I don't hear it back
[3:27:45.700 --> 3:27:46.700]  Understandings
[3:27:47.700 --> 3:27:48.700]  That's called grace
[3:27:49.700 --> 3:27:50.700]  I'm going back to the garden
[3:27:51.700 --> 3:27:52.700]  That's what being born again is about
[3:27:53.700 --> 3:27:54.700]  It's finding your way back to the garden
[3:27:55.700 --> 3:27:56.700]  And so what did God do
[3:27:57.700 --> 3:27:58.700]  God broke himself up into three parts
[3:27:59.700 --> 3:28:00.700]  We can read this
[3:28:02.700 --> 3:28:03.700]  And again you can also
[3:28:04.700 --> 3:28:05.700]  If you don't believe this
[3:28:06.700 --> 3:28:07.700]  It's okay just accept nothing from me
[3:28:08.700 --> 3:28:09.700]  Except just let me give my words
[3:28:10.700 --> 3:28:11.700]  So there's three parts to God
[3:28:12.700 --> 3:28:13.700]  There's the God that creates
[3:28:13.700 --> 3:28:14.700]  And the God that created the second part
[3:28:15.700 --> 3:28:16.700]  Christ to have fellowship with
[3:28:17.700 --> 3:28:18.700]  And then this third part
[3:28:19.700 --> 3:28:20.700]  The Holy Spirit
[3:28:20.700 --> 3:28:21.700]  These three parts
[3:28:22.700 --> 3:28:23.700]  And then God
[3:28:24.700 --> 3:28:25.700]  Sends part of himself to earth
[3:28:26.700 --> 3:28:27.700]  Well which part shows up
[3:28:28.700 --> 3:28:29.700]  Christ Jesus
[3:28:30.700 --> 3:28:31.700]  A man
[3:28:32.700 --> 3:28:33.700]  A man actually named Jesus
[3:28:34.700 --> 3:28:35.700]  Who's born in his home city
[3:28:36.700 --> 3:28:37.700]  Where his relatives all live
[3:28:38.700 --> 3:28:39.700]  He's there for the census
[3:28:40.700 --> 3:28:41.700]  Remember the story
[3:28:41.700 --> 3:28:42.700]  God can't even get a room
[3:28:45.700 --> 3:28:46.700]  I mean think of that
[3:28:47.700 --> 3:28:48.700]  You're God
[3:28:49.700 --> 3:28:50.700]  You can't even get a room
[3:28:51.700 --> 3:28:52.700]  In the city of your relatives
[3:28:53.700 --> 3:28:54.700]  Because no one sees you
[3:28:55.700 --> 3:28:56.700]  Wow that's kind of like an interesting thing
[3:28:57.700 --> 3:28:58.700]  So you're in a manger
[3:28:59.700 --> 3:29:00.700]  And you're in what other people might say
[3:29:01.700 --> 3:29:02.700]  Boy that's an uncomfortable condition
[3:29:03.700 --> 3:29:04.700]  But it wasn't for God
[3:29:05.700 --> 3:29:06.700]  Ever
[3:29:07.700 --> 3:29:08.700]  The whole walk
[3:29:08.700 --> 3:29:10.700]  God did when he put man in the earth
[3:29:11.700 --> 3:29:12.700]  When man left the garden
[3:29:13.700 --> 3:29:14.700]  When we got the knowledge of good and evil
[3:29:15.700 --> 3:29:16.700]  Which is the essence of duality
[3:29:17.700 --> 3:29:18.700]  And I could get into that
[3:29:19.700 --> 3:29:20.700]  But that would take another hour
[3:29:21.700 --> 3:29:22.700]  I'm hitting topics today
[3:29:23.700 --> 3:29:24.700]  That each take an hour to break down
[3:29:25.700 --> 3:29:26.700]  And I'm not going to have that
[3:29:27.700 --> 3:29:28.700]  So this is what's happening
[3:29:29.700 --> 3:29:30.700]  As I'm packing
[3:29:31.700 --> 3:29:32.700]  I know what's in it
[3:29:33.700 --> 3:29:34.700]  I'm delivering the information
[3:29:35.700 --> 3:29:36.700]  With intention behind it
[3:29:36.700 --> 3:29:37.700]  And I am behind it
[3:29:38.700 --> 3:29:39.700]  So I can say one word
[3:29:40.700 --> 3:29:41.700]  And the power in that word
[3:29:42.700 --> 3:29:43.700]  Is all of my experience
[3:29:44.700 --> 3:29:45.700]  Flowing into it
[3:29:46.700 --> 3:29:47.700]  Through this vibration
[3:29:48.700 --> 3:29:49.700]  That you pick up and translate a sound
[3:29:50.700 --> 3:29:51.700]  And within that
[3:29:52.700 --> 3:29:53.700]  Is the spirit that guides it
[3:29:54.700 --> 3:29:55.700]  That's why I don't worry anymore
[3:29:56.700 --> 3:29:57.700]  That's why this law is finally
[3:29:58.700 --> 3:29:59.700]  This law is finally unlocked
[3:30:00.700 --> 3:30:01.700]  So my voice can be freed
[3:30:02.700 --> 3:30:03.700]  Because God filters it out for everyone
[3:30:03.700 --> 3:30:05.700]  That's my purpose today
[3:30:06.700 --> 3:30:07.700]  I want to tell you
[3:30:08.700 --> 3:30:09.700]  I have been born again in a different way
[3:30:10.700 --> 3:30:11.700]  Even in this way
[3:30:12.700 --> 3:30:13.700]  In the midst of being born again
[3:30:14.700 --> 3:30:15.700]  Over and over perhaps
[3:30:16.700 --> 3:30:17.700]  As we transform our lives
[3:30:18.700 --> 3:30:19.700]  Maybe that's the essence of it
[3:30:20.700 --> 3:30:21.700]  And I want people to start thinking
[3:30:22.700 --> 3:30:23.700]  About me differently
[3:30:24.700 --> 3:30:25.700]  I was given the name Nicholas
[3:30:26.700 --> 3:30:27.700]  That's my name
[3:30:28.700 --> 3:30:29.700]  Not Dr. Nick Beggish
[3:30:30.700 --> 3:30:31.700]  Nicholas, please call me that
[3:30:31.700 --> 3:30:32.700]  Nicholas Beggish Army
[3:30:33.700 --> 3:30:34.700]  That's what my name means
[3:30:43.700 --> 3:30:44.700]  Where the hell did this water come from?
[3:30:46.700 --> 3:30:47.700]  Where did it come from?
[3:30:48.700 --> 3:30:49.700]  Where did it come from?
[3:30:50.700 --> 3:30:51.700]  Where did it come from?
[3:30:52.700 --> 3:30:53.700]  Infosore.com

[3:31:23.700 --> 3:31:26.700]  From infowarstore.com
[3:31:27.700 --> 3:31:29.700]  Infowarstore.com
[3:31:29.700 --> 3:31:54.700]  Other systems just don't compare
[3:31:59.700 --> 3:32:01.700]  To Amazon
[3:32:02.700 --> 3:32:03.700]  They told us that
[3:32:04.700 --> 3:32:05.700]  Two and a half million people would be dead
[3:32:06.700 --> 3:32:07.700]  Just eight months ago
[3:32:08.700 --> 3:32:09.700]  Within three months
[3:32:10.700 --> 3:32:11.700]  It's a quarter million
[3:32:12.700 --> 3:32:13.700]  If you count all of the people that died
[3:32:14.700 --> 3:32:15.700]  Of other things
[3:32:16.700 --> 3:32:17.700]  We're talking 96% at co-morbidity
[3:32:18.700 --> 3:32:19.700]  These are real numbers
[3:32:20.700 --> 3:32:21.700]  These are real facts
[3:32:22.700 --> 3:32:23.700]  This is the chicken little event
[3:32:24.700 --> 3:32:25.700]  We all run our houses
[3:32:26.700 --> 3:32:27.700]  Never come out
[3:32:27.700 --> 3:32:28.700]  Stand up against it
[3:32:29.700 --> 3:32:30.700]  This is slavery
[3:32:31.700 --> 3:32:32.700]  It is not something you can put up with and survive
[3:32:35.700 --> 3:32:36.700]  Now is the time to get prepared
[3:32:37.700 --> 3:32:38.700]  You gotta pray to God
[3:32:39.700 --> 3:32:40.700]  Get your soul ready
[3:32:41.700 --> 3:32:42.700]  You gotta be prepared to physically defend yourself
[3:32:43.700 --> 3:32:44.700]  And your family
[3:32:45.700 --> 3:32:46.700]  You've also got to get things that allow you
[3:32:47.700 --> 3:32:48.700]  And your family to not be dependent on the system
[3:32:49.700 --> 3:32:50.700]  That's why they want to bankrupt the economy
[3:32:51.700 --> 3:32:52.700]  It's why they want to destroy the infrastructure
[3:32:53.700 --> 3:32:54.700]  Of this nation
[3:32:54.700 --> 3:32:56.700]  They want all of us on our knees
[3:32:57.700 --> 3:32:58.700]  So they can dictate our surrender to them
[3:32:59.700 --> 3:33:00.700]  Info Wars is a critical organization
[3:33:01.700 --> 3:33:02.700]  In the fight against the globalist
[3:33:03.700 --> 3:33:04.700]  If you gave us straight up donations
[3:33:05.700 --> 3:33:06.700]  That would be great because our work is important
[3:33:07.700 --> 3:33:08.700]  We appreciate it

[3:33:54.700 --> 3:33:55.700]  And hundreds of other URLs
[3:33:56.700 --> 3:33:57.700]  We've launched have been banned
[3:33:58.700 --> 3:33:59.700]  That's why every month
[3:34:00.700 --> 3:34:01.700]  We launch a new URL
[3:34:02.700 --> 3:34:03.700]  Before they ban it
[3:34:04.700 --> 3:34:05.700]  But Soros
[3:34:06.700 --> 3:34:07.700]  And Bill Gates
[3:34:08.700 --> 3:34:09.700]  And the globalists are on our tail
[3:34:10.700 --> 3:34:11.700]  But the new website is
[3:34:12.700 --> 3:34:13.700]  The Resistance.Video
[3:34:14.700 --> 3:34:15.700]  The Resistance.Video
[3:34:16.700 --> 3:34:17.700]  They're trying to block us
[3:34:17.700 --> 3:34:19.700]  But they can't
[3:34:20.700 --> 3:34:21.700]  So the new URL
[3:34:22.700 --> 3:34:23.700]  That links right to Band.Video
[3:34:24.700 --> 3:34:25.700]  And all of our videos
[3:34:26.700 --> 3:34:27.700]  And all of our documentaries
[3:34:28.700 --> 3:34:29.700]  And all the special reports
[3:34:30.700 --> 3:34:31.700]  And all the suppressed information
[3:34:32.700 --> 3:34:33.700]  Is there the Resistance.Video
[3:34:34.700 --> 3:34:35.700]  Share the link
[3:34:36.700 --> 3:34:37.700]  The Resistance.Video
[3:34:38.700 --> 3:34:39.700]  The Resistance.Video
[3:34:39.700 --> 3:34:45.700]  The Resistance.Video
[3:35:06.700 --> 3:35:07.700]  We're in the middle
[3:35:07.700 --> 3:35:12.940]  of this deep dive into reality with what we're seeing play out of the world.
[3:35:12.940 --> 3:35:17.980]  I want to talk about that, you know, in the last segment, everyone's talking about masking
[3:35:17.980 --> 3:35:21.340]  and how this thing about hiding our humanity.
[3:35:21.340 --> 3:35:25.300]  But I want to talk about a secret they don't know, and they can hear it, but they can't
[3:35:25.300 --> 3:35:26.300]  turn this one off.
[3:35:26.300 --> 3:35:29.940]  It's called through the eyes, because the eyes, in fact, are the window of the soul.
[3:35:29.940 --> 3:35:34.700]  What Alex was saying about these evil people, these evil actors, you see it in their eyes.
[3:35:34.700 --> 3:35:37.860]  But let's focus on the other side of that equation.
[3:35:37.860 --> 3:35:42.100]  When I look in people's eyes, and I've talked about it, I see the inner man, I see the soul.
[3:35:42.100 --> 3:35:46.620]  And here's what you do when you see that in everyone else.
[3:35:46.620 --> 3:35:51.660]  What you can do when you see that is you begin responding to that inner soul, to that divinity
[3:35:51.660 --> 3:35:52.660]  in that person.
[3:35:52.660 --> 3:35:54.860]  Even if they're your enemy, you can't help it.
[3:35:54.860 --> 3:35:57.020]  You've got to respond to that divinity in them.
[3:35:57.020 --> 3:36:00.620]  Even if they're your worst adversary, if you do that, if you look in the eyes and see the
[3:36:00.620 --> 3:36:05.700]  divinity and you begin behaving as if they're divine, what happens is they have no choice
[3:36:05.700 --> 3:36:10.420]  but to yield to the higher power, which is to then act divinely, at least some level,
[3:36:10.420 --> 3:36:13.460]  or be contained by the energy of it.
[3:36:13.460 --> 3:36:16.500]  That's the power of acting divinely.
[3:36:16.500 --> 3:36:18.540]  It works, actually.
[3:36:18.540 --> 3:36:19.540]  It works.
[3:36:19.540 --> 3:36:22.420]  It's about lowering it.
[3:36:22.420 --> 3:36:23.420]  Not for everyone.
[3:36:23.420 --> 3:36:26.140]  See, this is the other thing that everyone gets confused about.
[3:36:26.140 --> 3:36:29.900]  People say, oh, people interrupt too much.
[3:36:29.900 --> 3:36:31.620]  I hear that sometimes about Alex.
[3:36:31.620 --> 3:36:33.180]  Well, I have that problem too.
[3:36:33.180 --> 3:36:36.940]  My former fiancee told me that.
[3:36:36.940 --> 3:36:37.940]  And I believe that.
[3:36:37.940 --> 3:36:38.940]  I accept that.
[3:36:38.940 --> 3:36:39.940]  That's true.
[3:36:39.940 --> 3:36:40.940]  I need to learn to listen more.
[3:36:40.940 --> 3:36:43.380]  Also, in my prayer life, I need to listen more.
[3:36:43.380 --> 3:36:45.420]  Now, let me talk about that.
[3:36:45.420 --> 3:36:49.620]  Everyone's praying, praying, praying, and they're waiting for some angel to show up and, boom,
[3:36:49.620 --> 3:36:53.460]  deliver you the noise, that's not how it happens, unfortunately.
[3:36:53.460 --> 3:36:56.620]  And if it did, it would make the sure a lot easier.
[3:36:56.620 --> 3:36:57.940]  But it is meant to be easier.
[3:36:57.940 --> 3:37:00.180]  It's meant to be instructive.
[3:37:00.180 --> 3:37:02.980]  OK, that's what all this problem is about.
[3:37:02.980 --> 3:37:05.940]  When you can finally release it is when you've accepted grace.
[3:37:05.940 --> 3:37:07.900]  Now think about the story again.
[3:37:07.900 --> 3:37:12.300]  So God comes into the earth as a person that can't even get a decent room at a hotel in
[3:37:12.300 --> 3:37:13.300]  his own town.
[3:37:13.300 --> 3:37:14.300]  And then what happens?
[3:37:14.300 --> 3:37:18.620]  You don't hear much about it until he's 12 and he's in the temple having a big discussion.
[3:37:18.620 --> 3:37:22.060]  The building that later he showed up in and kicked all the money changers, because that's
[3:37:22.060 --> 3:37:26.900]  the old temple, the old structures, the old Testament, if you will, the law, the old
[3:37:26.900 --> 3:37:31.020]  rules that had no forgiveness in them, the punishment of it all, if you will.
[3:37:31.020 --> 3:37:34.980]  But think about God in his position in all of this.
[3:37:34.980 --> 3:37:36.940]  You want to just beat your children forever?
[3:37:36.940 --> 3:37:42.260]  No, you want them to wake up and remember who they are and where they came from.
[3:37:42.260 --> 3:37:43.260]  That's what you want.
[3:37:43.260 --> 3:37:48.340]  You want them to claim their heritage, their birthright, and embrace it with you.
[3:37:48.340 --> 3:37:49.340]  That's what you want.
[3:37:49.340 --> 3:37:51.060]  That's what God wants for us, too.
[3:37:51.060 --> 3:37:52.900]  Can you imagine it any other way?
[3:37:52.900 --> 3:37:57.540]  And that's just the physical little tiny snapshot of what unconditional and unlimited
[3:37:57.540 --> 3:37:59.040]  love.
[3:37:59.040 --> 3:38:01.580]  That's a pretty big thing.
[3:38:01.580 --> 3:38:04.660]  And it's so small in terms of what's available.
[3:38:04.660 --> 3:38:05.660]  All right.
[3:38:05.660 --> 3:38:06.660]  All right.
[3:38:06.660 --> 3:38:09.140]  So let me switch gears a little bit here as I'm explaining this.
[3:38:09.140 --> 3:38:12.680]  So at 12, you have this big conversation that again, he disappears.
[3:38:12.680 --> 3:38:16.460]  You don't hear anything about him and he's off banging nails.
[3:38:16.460 --> 3:38:18.900]  You know, what happened in the punishment to man?
[3:38:18.900 --> 3:38:21.860]  OK, women had it one way and we go look that.
[3:38:21.860 --> 3:38:25.180]  I'm not talking about that, I'm not talking about men because I'm a man and I know that
[3:38:25.180 --> 3:38:26.180]  one better.
[3:38:26.180 --> 3:38:27.180]  I don't know much about women.
[3:38:27.180 --> 3:38:30.860]  I got a lot to learn, a tremendous amount to learn.
[3:38:30.860 --> 3:38:34.300]  But as it goes for man, you know, we have to earn by the sweat of our brow.
[3:38:34.300 --> 3:38:35.900]  We have to go out and toil in the soil.
[3:38:35.900 --> 3:38:40.500]  We have to make the work and it's hard every day, every single day.
[3:38:40.500 --> 3:38:47.540]  So God comes down in the form of Christ, his second aspect in the three, and he sweats
[3:38:47.540 --> 3:38:50.540]  and bangs nails and has a job that's hard.
[3:38:50.540 --> 3:38:51.540]  Some say he was a bricklayer.
[3:38:51.540 --> 3:38:52.540]  I don't want to argue the point.
[3:38:52.540 --> 3:38:56.380]  The point is he worked with his hands.
[3:38:56.380 --> 3:39:02.860]  How many so-called priests, how many so-called ministers worked with their hands?
[3:39:02.860 --> 3:39:03.860]  I knew one who did.
[3:39:03.860 --> 3:39:04.860]  His name was Eric Hewlett.
[3:39:04.860 --> 3:39:09.780]  He was a wallpaper hanger that was an assembly as a God minister, preaching other ministers
[3:39:09.780 --> 3:39:11.300]  to do it right later in his life.
[3:39:11.300 --> 3:39:13.020]  I reconnected with him.
[3:39:13.020 --> 3:39:14.020]  He taught people.
[3:39:14.020 --> 3:39:19.860]  He had a heart for God, not a heart for a building program, you know, and so he worked
[3:39:19.860 --> 3:39:24.820]  for a living and made sure all the resources went to where it's supposed to go to redistribute
[3:39:24.820 --> 3:39:29.860]  in a way that's done from the heart, not from a socialistic system driven by a bunch of
[3:39:29.860 --> 3:39:36.940]  assholes, excuse me, but they are telling us what to do and pushing us around and crushing
[3:39:36.940 --> 3:39:41.220]  our spirits and making us less than, less than, less than when we're more than we ever
[3:39:41.220 --> 3:39:42.820]  thought we were.
[3:39:42.820 --> 3:39:46.940]  And so I'm reframing who I am a bit and have been for the last several months.
[3:39:46.940 --> 3:39:53.420]  If you haven't noticed, for less technology and more about what drives the change, because
[3:39:53.420 --> 3:39:58.460]  that's the technology of the soul, let's jump up a bit, you know, and let's start
[3:39:58.460 --> 3:40:05.220]  retranslating the reality and recreating it in the image and likeness of God.
[3:40:05.220 --> 3:40:06.220]  Let's bring heaven to earth.
[3:40:06.220 --> 3:40:11.660]  That's what's going to happen in the end, but right now we're in the birth pain, okay?
[3:40:11.660 --> 3:40:16.340]  Nothing beautiful comes in the earth without pain, unfortunately.
[3:40:16.340 --> 3:40:17.860]  Think of the transfiguration then.
[3:40:17.860 --> 3:40:18.860]  What happened then?
[3:40:18.860 --> 3:40:19.860]  Okay.
[3:40:19.860 --> 3:40:20.860]  What happened then?
[3:40:20.860 --> 3:40:21.860]  Christ.
[3:40:21.860 --> 3:40:24.260]  Oh, he didn't have the Holy Spirit, right?
[3:40:24.260 --> 3:40:25.260]  That wasn't there.
[3:40:25.260 --> 3:40:27.380]  The power behind being God.
[3:40:27.380 --> 3:40:30.300]  So he really was a person in the earth.
[3:40:30.300 --> 3:40:31.460]  People don't want to talk about this.
[3:40:31.460 --> 3:40:32.460]  They forget about all this.
[3:40:32.460 --> 3:40:41.820]  This is the most important thing that identifies us, that pulls us into the life of God.
[3:40:41.820 --> 3:40:48.540]  Oh, hadn't heard it that way before, have you?
[3:40:48.540 --> 3:40:50.660]  Think about what the church is.
[3:40:50.660 --> 3:40:52.500]  It's created distortion.
[3:40:52.500 --> 3:40:57.180]  It's taken our power for 2,000 years and its current structures on the earth.
[3:40:57.180 --> 3:41:02.740]  In the end, in the latter days, there would be a form of godliness that denies the inner
[3:41:02.740 --> 3:41:04.060]  power of it.
[3:41:04.060 --> 3:41:06.340]  Look around.
[3:41:06.340 --> 3:41:08.900]  Look around.
[3:41:08.900 --> 3:41:11.700]  Which cues are you warming in the world?
[3:41:11.700 --> 3:41:17.020]  Are you warming the cues of your temple, yourself, your soul, who you are?
[3:41:17.020 --> 3:41:18.940]  Are you honoring that temple?
[3:41:18.940 --> 3:41:20.620]  Are you giving back 10%?
[3:41:20.620 --> 3:41:23.380]  Are you tithing to your own temple?
[3:41:23.380 --> 3:41:25.140]  Think about that.
[3:41:25.140 --> 3:41:33.060]  90% mission, 10% to keep you nurtured and connected to the creation where you should
[3:41:33.060 --> 3:41:35.140]  be happy in it.
[3:41:35.140 --> 3:41:39.580]  Parents don't want their kids working to the bone until they die early of a heart attack.
[3:41:39.580 --> 3:41:40.580]  Either is God.
[3:41:40.580 --> 3:41:45.860]  Plenty of people around, don't worry, don't worry, because the unconscious and there's
[3:41:45.860 --> 3:41:49.020]  more of them than us actually get used anyway.
[3:41:49.020 --> 3:41:50.500]  They're the collateral damage.
[3:41:50.500 --> 3:41:53.420]  They're the millions and millions that are going to die and we're going to see it happen
[3:41:53.420 --> 3:41:54.700]  in our eyes.
[3:41:54.700 --> 3:41:57.820]  The clouds are just now gathering, folks.
[3:41:57.820 --> 3:42:01.620]  Dark days are headed our way in lots of different ways in the world.
[3:42:01.620 --> 3:42:07.500]  We need to prepare our spirit, mind, and emotions and our physical form because we're still
[3:42:07.500 --> 3:42:09.300]  in the physical world.
[3:42:09.300 --> 3:42:14.580]  We all can be leaders because here's what leaders do if they're really good and all
[3:42:14.580 --> 3:42:17.660]  of you can get really good at this.
[3:42:17.660 --> 3:42:22.820]  When you look in the eyes of another and you begin to do that, pull out of people what's
[3:42:22.820 --> 3:42:27.300]  possible and they begin to act like you're envisioning them because they got to respond
[3:42:27.300 --> 3:42:28.300]  to you.
[3:42:28.300 --> 3:42:30.460]  That's how it works.
[3:42:30.460 --> 3:42:31.460]  You know what you do?
[3:42:31.460 --> 3:42:32.460]  You do a great work.
[3:42:32.460 --> 3:42:33.460]  That's the work of a leader.
[3:42:33.460 --> 3:42:38.020]  See the higher and better person that even the person acting out in some crazy way can't
[3:42:38.020 --> 3:42:39.020]  see.
[3:42:39.020 --> 3:42:42.580]  The other caution is, and I didn't learn this until I was 52 because I just assumed everybody
[3:42:42.580 --> 3:42:46.300]  saw people that way because I always have, and they don't.
[3:42:46.300 --> 3:42:47.300]  I was really disappointed.
[3:42:47.300 --> 3:42:48.300]  I broke my heart.
[3:42:48.300 --> 3:42:52.460]  I mentioned it in previous shows in the last six months.
[3:42:52.460 --> 3:42:56.340]  What broke my heart is I couldn't imagine going through life without being that connected
[3:42:56.340 --> 3:42:57.340]  to individuals.
[3:42:57.340 --> 3:43:00.540]  That's why I've had so many friends and I've had 50 die.
[3:43:00.540 --> 3:43:01.540]  I quit counting now.
[3:43:01.540 --> 3:43:03.140]  I can't count them anymore.
[3:43:03.140 --> 3:43:04.620]  I just don't want to.
[3:43:04.620 --> 3:43:12.220]  I have so many more and I have two million that are in union with me in this few moments
[3:43:12.220 --> 3:43:18.660]  each week, have a conversation about things that matter that equip us to be calm in the
[3:43:18.660 --> 3:43:26.580]  middle of the storm that's coming because at the end of all this, blessed are the peacemakers
[3:43:26.580 --> 3:43:29.780]  for they inherit the earth.
[3:43:29.780 --> 3:43:37.580]  Sometimes we can have the sword, the sword that we want to swing, but we keep it cheap
[3:43:37.580 --> 3:43:43.420]  in our hearts and we swing the sword with our words and they come out of us in a different
[3:43:43.420 --> 3:43:47.980]  way because words are where the reality began, right?
[3:43:47.980 --> 3:43:56.100]  In the beginning was the word, boom, the very first vibration comes into being and then
[3:43:56.100 --> 3:44:02.780]  in that vibration, matter appears and then Max Planck, one of the best quantum physicists
[3:44:02.780 --> 3:44:07.460]  and this is where this lies and this is my interpretation of quantum physics in this
[3:44:07.460 --> 3:44:12.460]  message I'm giving today and it's in it all through it and this is what Max Planck, the
[3:44:12.460 --> 3:44:16.580]  father of quantum mechanics said, I regard consciousness as fundamental.
[3:44:16.580 --> 3:44:20.220]  I regard matter as derivative of consciousness.
[3:44:20.220 --> 3:44:23.300]  We cannot get behind consciousness.
[3:44:23.300 --> 3:44:28.580]  Everything we talk about, everything that we regard as existing postulate consciousness.
[3:44:28.580 --> 3:44:34.180]  In other words, it comes out of somebody's thinking something and it's a big somebody
[3:44:34.180 --> 3:44:37.220]  thinking it all at once.
[3:44:37.220 --> 3:44:42.380]  Even physicists get this if they've gone deep enough within their own math through that
[3:44:42.380 --> 3:44:45.980]  pathway to discover the very beginning of God.
[3:44:45.980 --> 3:44:51.020]  That's all it is, is the beginning of God because the beginning of God starts with asking
[3:44:51.020 --> 3:44:54.860]  question to your soul, what is God?
[3:44:54.860 --> 3:44:56.060]  I did it.
[3:44:56.060 --> 3:45:00.180]  I did it when I told a priest, when he drugged me out and we had this conversation out in
[3:45:00.180 --> 3:45:05.500]  the outer vestibule and why I wasn't going to do it and I'm going to talk about that.
[3:45:05.500 --> 3:45:10.860]  I'm going to talk about that but I'm out of time today so there it is, you've got the
[3:45:10.860 --> 3:45:13.820]  only message I can give and the one I came from my heart.
[3:45:13.820 --> 3:45:18.380]  We'll do this again next week and we're going to figure out a way to head up to the backlog.
[3:45:18.380 --> 3:45:22.940]  I love you all, have a wonderful weekend.
