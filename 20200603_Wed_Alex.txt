[00:00.000 --> 00:17.120]  I can need creation, not destruction, cooperation, not contempt, security, not anarchy, healing,
[00:17.120 --> 00:28.280]  not hatred, justice, not chaos, this is our mission, and we will succeed, 100 percent,
[00:28.280 --> 00:33.000]  we will succeed, our country always wins.
[00:33.000 --> 00:39.640]  That is why I am taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security
[00:39.640 --> 00:42.000]  and safety in America.
[00:42.000 --> 00:48.680]  I am mobilizing all available federal resources, civilian and military, to stop the rioting
[00:48.680 --> 00:56.040]  and looting, to end the destruction and arson, and to protect the rights of law-abiding Americans,
[00:56.040 --> 00:59.960]  including your Second Amendment rights.
[00:59.960 --> 01:05.280]  Therefore, the following measures are going into effect immediately.
[01:05.280 --> 01:12.720]  First, we are ending the riots and lawlessness that has spread throughout our country.
[01:12.720 --> 01:14.760]  We will end it now.
[01:14.760 --> 01:22.640]  Today I have strongly recommended to every governor to deploy the National Guard in sufficient
[01:22.640 --> 01:26.920]  numbers that we dominate the streets.
[01:26.920 --> 01:32.200]  Mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence
[01:32.200 --> 01:34.320]  has been quelled.
[01:34.320 --> 01:40.600]  If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property
[01:40.600 --> 01:47.080]  of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the
[01:47.080 --> 01:49.520]  problem for them.
[01:49.520 --> 01:56.520]  I am also taking swift and decisive action to protect our great capital, Washington,
[01:56.520 --> 01:57.880]  D.C.
[01:57.880 --> 02:02.800]  What happened in this city last night was a total disgrace.
[02:02.800 --> 02:10.000]  As we speak, I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military
[02:10.000 --> 02:18.960]  personnel, and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults,
[02:18.960 --> 02:22.760]  and the wanton destruction of property.
[02:22.760 --> 02:24.880]  We are putting everybody on warning.
[02:24.880 --> 02:29.960]  Our seven o'clock curfew will be strictly enforced.
[02:29.960 --> 02:36.000]  Those who threaten innocent life and property will be arrested, detained, and prosecuted
[02:36.000 --> 02:39.080]  to the fullest extent of the law.
[02:39.080 --> 02:44.760]  I want the organizers of this terror to be on notice that you will face severe criminal
[02:44.760 --> 02:51.360]  penalties and lengthy sentences in jail.
[02:51.360 --> 02:55.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've now discovered who is delivering bricks to more than 20 cities.
[02:55.840 --> 03:00.000]  It's Acme Brick owned by Berkshire Hathaway and Bill Gates.
[03:00.000 --> 03:03.880]  We can't make that up.
[03:03.880 --> 03:06.440]  That is the arrogance that is the Civil War we're in.
[03:06.440 --> 03:11.480]  We're in today, what, 78 of the lockdowns, and then now they trigger all these riots
[03:11.480 --> 03:17.920]  and all over Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, they're blocking anybody showing rioters and
[03:17.920 --> 03:23.840]  looters racially attacking white people, but also randomly attacking black people, Asians,
[03:23.840 --> 03:29.280]  Hispanics, burning down mainly black businesses because that's the neighborhoods.
[03:29.280 --> 03:31.400]  Just total bedlam.
[03:31.400 --> 03:33.440]  And if you try to show it, it's deleted.
[03:33.440 --> 03:38.240]  Tucker Carlson talked about that last night that the media is acting like this is good
[03:38.240 --> 03:39.240]  and this is all peaceful.
[03:39.240 --> 03:44.920]  Remember the MSNBC idiot last Saturday saying, oh, there's nothing violent.
[03:44.920 --> 03:52.880]  This is all very peaceful with a building, a 10 story building behind him in flames.
[03:52.880 --> 03:54.000]  So this is the Psyop.
[03:54.000 --> 04:00.200]  And then when the military ends up killing people, shooting looters, they're going to
[04:00.200 --> 04:03.720]  act like it's another race war crime.
[04:03.720 --> 04:04.720]  It's insane.
[04:04.720 --> 04:08.200]  And I got to tell you, I know a lot of people have been robbed in their homes, they've been
[04:08.200 --> 04:10.280]  robbed in their cars, have been robbed.
[04:10.280 --> 04:14.880]  I was saying, you know, earlier go out with COVID-19, it's basically a hoax, but I will
[04:14.880 --> 04:19.600]  tell everybody now, you should not be out after dark in any major urban area and you
[04:19.600 --> 04:22.440]  should be packing and you should be locking your doors and you should be watching your
[04:22.440 --> 04:30.440]  ass because I just learned before I went live that my son was going to visit my parents
[04:30.440 --> 04:36.240]  and there was looters in the store attacking people and he had to kick their ass and we've
[04:36.240 --> 04:37.240]  got that dramatic footage.
[04:37.240 --> 04:38.240]  It's unbelievable.
[04:38.240 --> 04:40.680]  It looks like a movie.
[04:40.680 --> 04:46.000]  So that's how crazy all this is and I guess it happened a few days ago, it didn't even
[04:46.000 --> 04:49.600]  tell me until now because he got the footage from the security camera.
[04:49.600 --> 04:51.200]  I mean, that's how bad this is, folks.
[04:51.200 --> 04:53.960]  They're robbing two gun shops I go to have been robbed.
[04:53.960 --> 05:02.000]  I mean, it's just a total bedlam, we'll be right back.
[05:02.000 --> 05:04.640]  Please remember that we have a lot of great products that have been out of stock, back
[05:04.640 --> 05:05.640]  in stock, like krill oil.
[05:05.640 --> 05:10.480]  We have the ultimate krill oil, if you don't know the benefits of krill oil, it's incredible.
[05:10.480 --> 05:14.080]  Everything in your body, for your heart, your skin, your libido, your stamina, your dreams,
[05:14.080 --> 05:16.720]  take one of these for you to sleep, it's well-known.
[05:16.720 --> 05:21.440]  Experience it for yourself, infowarstore.com, X2 sold out for much, deep earth, pure crystal

[05:32.000 --> 05:35.160]  Both formulas were really close to selling out, real red pill plus, it's got some stimulant
[05:35.160 --> 05:40.480]  in the natural caffeine, that's close to selling out, 50% off still, infowarstore.com and we're
[05:40.480 --> 05:43.880]  already talking to our suppliers and some of them are saying, we may not take orders
[05:43.880 --> 05:47.640]  in a few months, so I may not ever be able to get products again, things are collapsing
[05:47.640 --> 05:52.720]  so bad folks, this is total depression, the infrastructure is going down, get the products
[05:52.720 --> 06:05.560]  while you still can.
[06:05.560 --> 06:11.360]  I have been playing air raid sirens for seven months before COVID, before all this because
[06:11.360 --> 06:14.200]  I'm telling you they're making their move.
[06:14.200 --> 06:21.280]  We are now under martial law and if we make one wrong step, not just the country but the
[06:21.280 --> 06:26.480]  world is going to plunge into a giant new military conflict.
[06:26.480 --> 06:32.560]  We were at war with China and with collaborators inside the government and multinational corporations.
[06:32.560 --> 06:36.520]  These people are insane, they are not war makers, they don't have the real history behind
[06:36.520 --> 06:40.800]  it, they've gotten away with so many crimes, but these corporates believe they can pull
[06:40.800 --> 06:46.000]  this off and not end up getting pulled into the war they start, I assure them they will
[06:46.000 --> 06:47.000]  be pulled into it.
[06:47.000 --> 06:52.320]  Here is the Polk County Sheriff in Florida, now that the looters are announcing they're
[06:52.320 --> 06:56.520]  going into the suburbs, it's already begun, responding that is the citizens right in duty
[06:56.520 --> 07:00.160]  to defend themselves and he warns the looters.
[07:00.160 --> 07:06.960]  We have received information in social media that some of the criminals were going to take
[07:06.960 --> 07:10.440]  their criminal conduct into the neighborhoods.
[07:10.440 --> 07:16.040]  I would tell them if you value your life you probably shouldn't do that in Polk County
[07:16.040 --> 07:24.120]  because the people of Polk County like guns, they have guns, I encourage them to own guns
[07:24.120 --> 07:29.480]  and they're going to be in their homes tonight with their guns loaded and if you try to break
[07:29.480 --> 07:37.000]  into their homes to steal, to set fires, I'm highly recommending they blow you back out
[07:37.000 --> 07:40.160]  of the house with their guns.
[07:40.160 --> 07:47.760]  So leave the community alone and we'll do our best to support the community, but ladies
[07:47.760 --> 07:53.600]  and gentlemen, make no mistake about it, all of that ugliness has taken away from what
[07:53.600 --> 08:01.960]  we're united about, we're united about the conduct that you saw with George where his
[08:01.960 --> 08:07.040]  life was taken with the need of the neck, it's horrific and there's not enough words
[08:07.040 --> 08:14.920]  to explain that, let's keep the focus on that.
[08:14.920 --> 08:18.400]  And the fact that they've now come up with a medical examiner report that he had enough
[08:18.400 --> 08:24.880]  fentanyl in his system to kill four or five people and he was resisting and he was out
[08:24.880 --> 08:28.200]  of control and the police were scared and didn't pay attention and put their knee on
[08:28.200 --> 08:32.400]  his neck and he had a heart attack and died.
[08:32.400 --> 08:35.480]  It's not defending what the cop did, it's not about that.
[08:35.480 --> 08:39.600]  It's about the PSIOP to create a civil war in this country.
[08:39.600 --> 08:46.960]  It's June 2nd, the year is 2020, on this Tuesday transmission, 153 days out from the election
[08:46.960 --> 08:54.640]  and all of this is about the globalist corporate system and their testing ground of communist
[08:54.640 --> 09:02.120]  China, their evil anti-human, anti-God laboratory, projecting their power out and punishing us
[09:02.120 --> 09:09.160]  for electing Trump and punishing us for electing Balasaro, Bolsonaro and punishing us for not
[09:09.160 --> 09:13.840]  wanting their new world order and not wanting drag queen pedophile story time.
[09:13.840 --> 09:18.560]  And the democrats and the globalists and the EU are on record saying this is to punish
[09:18.560 --> 09:20.200]  you.
[09:20.200 --> 09:24.440]  This is to teach you to cut your carbon, this is to teach you that you're bad.
[09:24.440 --> 09:32.240]  This is an atonement, they have three or four purge movies where the whites go out and kill
[09:32.240 --> 09:42.240]  black people every time they have one of these purges and of course that's the inverse of
[09:42.240 --> 09:43.240]  what's happening.
[09:43.240 --> 09:48.040]  This is the media going on and telling black people go out and purge white people, random
[09:48.040 --> 09:52.840]  old lady in a wheelchair, homeless lady, knock her teeth out, white dude walking down the
[09:52.840 --> 09:54.800]  street, kill them.
[09:54.800 --> 09:59.320]  There have been cops more than 10 police shot in the last 24 hours.
[09:59.320 --> 10:03.760]  I can't find one of their names because the media will not humanize them and it's not
[10:03.760 --> 10:09.440]  about worshiping police, it's about worshiping reality, truth.
[10:09.440 --> 10:14.360]  There's a cop in a coma dying in Vegas right now, randomly shot in the head.
[10:14.360 --> 10:19.680]  They won't show him, they won't say his name because they will not humanize people but
[10:19.680 --> 10:26.400]  we all know George Floyd's name, clearly a drug dealer, clearly involved in the rackets,
[10:26.400 --> 10:33.440]  clearly involved with those cops that knew him in some weird behavior.
[10:33.440 --> 10:38.240]  Dropping a white baggie out of his pocket when they've got him in handcuffs, he's fishing
[10:38.240 --> 10:42.160]  it out and we exclusively broke that footage yesterday.
[10:42.160 --> 10:46.120]  Everybody knows it's there, not one outlet covered it because that's not politically
[10:46.120 --> 10:52.480]  correct and it's not defending it, it's showing the craziness we're all involved in.
[10:52.480 --> 10:57.000]  And now the medical examiner comes out and he had overdose levels of fentanyl, the chai
[10:57.000 --> 10:58.000]  com weapon.
[10:58.000 --> 11:02.720]  Oh, but nobody cares about the chai com weapon killing hundreds of thousands of people a
[11:02.720 --> 11:06.160]  year, black, white, old, young.
[11:06.160 --> 11:13.120]  It's all just about, oh, the cop kills him, he begs for his life, it's very poignant but
[11:13.120 --> 11:19.480]  Facebook, Twitter, Google are removing videos of white people being beaten and being killed
[11:19.480 --> 11:24.640]  and being shot and racist black people programmed by the media to do this.
[11:24.640 --> 11:28.780]  Do I then blame all black people that, oh, there's some racist black people out there
[11:28.780 --> 11:30.280]  that are idiots?
[11:30.280 --> 11:33.120]  No, because I'm not a moron myself.
[11:33.120 --> 11:38.320]  It goes back to Martin Luther King, you judge somebody on who they are.
[11:38.320 --> 11:43.400]  Now, there are so many of these videos, but I just want to get to these now, two of the
[11:43.400 --> 11:49.040]  seven or eight I've already seen this morning of black people all over the United States
[11:49.040 --> 11:55.120]  coming up to looters in Texas and Minnesota and Illinois and going, oh, it's a bunch of
[11:55.120 --> 12:02.040]  fancy pants, anti for girls, college girls, probably college professors wearing their
[12:02.040 --> 12:07.120]  Rolexes, you name it, I mean these people literally are very wealthy on average.
[12:07.120 --> 12:12.240]  And this is them going out and getting their military experience, this is them going out
[12:12.240 --> 12:16.720]  to piss on America and the black people are walking up saying, hey, why are you putting
[12:16.720 --> 12:19.720]  black lives matter on these businesses and knocking the windows out, you're just, you're
[12:19.720 --> 12:23.040]  doing that to try to stir people up and we've got these videos all over the country.
[12:23.040 --> 12:27.360]  Antifa goes up and knocks the first windows out at the Louis Vuitton or the other luxury
[12:27.360 --> 12:33.440]  shop and then gets the black teenagers that are out on the street to go in and do it.
[12:33.440 --> 12:41.040]  And that's what's in these Homeland Security documents and these reports right here.
[12:41.040 --> 12:48.680]  Remember two years ago, remember Brian Stelter and CNN and ABC News saying Alex Jones is
[12:48.680 --> 12:49.920]  insane.
[12:49.920 --> 12:55.480]  Alex Jones says that there's a planned uprising by Antifa and trying to cause a race war.
[12:55.480 --> 12:56.480]  Remember all those clips?
[12:56.480 --> 12:58.480]  Maybe our archive is confined.
[12:58.480 --> 13:07.360]  I probably said it 500 times and I was going off their own action plans, their own documents
[13:07.360 --> 13:11.880]  where Alexander Soros funds hundreds of millions of dollars a year to try to cause race wars
[13:11.880 --> 13:17.240]  and how they train the Antifa to go smash buildings and then encourage blacks to join
[13:17.240 --> 13:18.400]  them.
[13:18.400 --> 13:22.200]  Literally preying on black people like they're stupid trying to trick them.
[13:22.200 --> 13:25.680]  This isn't about defending black people because they're doing it, it's wrong and it's terrible.
[13:25.680 --> 13:31.200]  The point is, is that here you want to indict somebody, Attorney General Barr?
[13:31.200 --> 13:33.440]  You want to have the proof of the criminal conspiracy?
[13:33.440 --> 13:39.160]  Here it is, open and shut, run as a military action plan.
[13:39.160 --> 13:46.720]  With an HQ and commanders and radios and codes, these are professional criminals.
[13:46.720 --> 13:49.480]  No need to charge them with terrorism even though that's what they're doing politically
[13:49.480 --> 13:55.440]  trying to shut down our speech, threatening us, they're engaged in organized crime racketeering.
[13:55.440 --> 13:58.600]  They should all spend 50 years in prison.
[13:58.600 --> 14:03.360]  This is, people are dying because of this and these swarmy academics believe they rule
[14:03.360 --> 14:08.240]  America with their arrogance so they can dress up in black uniforms and go out and target
[14:08.240 --> 14:12.800]  black people to get them to go commit crimes to create a race war.
[14:12.800 --> 14:17.080]  Let me tell you, there are a lot of mentally ill people folks.
[14:17.080 --> 14:20.240]  Mentally ill black people, white people, you know, I've been downtown this morning driving
[14:20.240 --> 14:21.240]  around looking at what's happening.
[14:21.240 --> 14:28.360]  I see a bunch of mentally ill, homeless, white, Hispanic and black zombies going around crazy
[14:28.360 --> 14:34.520]  and they are attacking people and just, it's just bedlam.
[14:34.520 --> 14:40.720]  So full page New York Times articles, advertisements, calling for overthrowing the government, triggering
[14:40.720 --> 14:42.600]  a race war.
[14:42.600 --> 14:45.680]  And they literally came out in the national news when I said this and said, Jones is
[14:45.680 --> 14:52.720]  insane, it doesn't exist, it's not happening.
[14:52.720 --> 14:55.680]  So here's the document you need to send to the White House and send to the Attorney General
[14:55.680 --> 14:56.680]  and send to the FBI.
[14:56.680 --> 15:01.520]  They know all this, you got FBI agents, it turns out they're in Antifa running it.
[15:01.520 --> 15:05.480]  Documents to tell plan for civil unrest and martial law in Baltimore.
[15:05.480 --> 15:09.840]  And this is the blueprint for the whole damn thing with the documents.
[15:09.840 --> 15:13.520]  And they have fought like the devil and Soros has funded all these lawsuits and all these
[15:13.520 --> 15:15.320]  dirty tricks to get us off the air.
[15:15.320 --> 15:18.680]  That's why I show you this every week.
[15:18.680 --> 15:22.480]  Where they go, what cops are in on it with them, how the police captains have already
[15:22.480 --> 15:25.960]  organized where they're allowed to stage stuff to try to trick the black people.
[15:25.960 --> 15:27.520]  It actually says it and they're doing it.
[15:27.520 --> 15:29.360]  This is sick, man.
[15:29.360 --> 15:30.920]  This is sick.
[15:30.920 --> 15:35.160]  This is the blueprint for the crime and they're doing it.
[15:35.160 --> 15:39.720]  So when we come back, we've got folks catching them, including one of the top UFC fighters
[15:39.720 --> 15:44.320]  in the world, John Jones, going up and catching a bunch of chicken-necked white people trying
[15:44.320 --> 15:48.960]  to trick black folks into rioting and looting, and he just takes this break and paint cans
[15:48.960 --> 15:51.000]  away from him.
[15:51.000 --> 15:52.000]  Unbelievable.
[15:52.000 --> 15:53.000]  We'll be right back.
[15:53.000 --> 15:54.000]  Stay with us.
[15:54.000 --> 16:03.440]  We're living in insanely dangerous times and I've told folks going back three months
[16:03.440 --> 16:07.160]  ago, I'm not buying storeable food because I'm worried about the COVID-19 virus.
[16:07.160 --> 16:11.160]  I'm worried about the food shortages and the economic collapse and now it's admitted
[16:11.160 --> 16:15.160]  that a chain reaction has begun that's already caused food shortages and the collapse of
[16:15.160 --> 16:18.960]  farms and ranches across the United States and it's even worse in the third world.
[16:18.960 --> 16:22.760]  So I hope Trump, with his initiatives, can clean this up and fix it, but with the election
[16:22.760 --> 16:27.320]  fraud and the COVID-19, all the wars and the third world collapsing and everything else
[16:27.320 --> 16:32.640]  is going on, now is the time to get storeable foods because they'll last for 25 years.
[16:32.640 --> 16:34.640]  They're in easily totable bags.
[16:34.640 --> 16:38.440]  It's high quality food and it's good to have that box checked off to be ready and it funds
[16:38.440 --> 16:39.440]  the Info War.

[17:59.600 --> 18:15.760]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:15.760 --> 18:21.760]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[18:21.760 --> 18:30.880]  Let me just get this out of the way as a declaration, and again, everything we talk
[18:30.880 --> 18:35.960]  about here is very important, but if we could highlight this and have red neon on it, that
[18:35.960 --> 18:36.960]  would be good.
[18:36.960 --> 18:39.400]  Maybe some fireworks going off behind it.
[18:39.400 --> 18:44.440]  I think everybody understands now, we can't live in peace with Democrats and leftists
[18:44.440 --> 18:46.840]  and the pedophiles and the devil worshipers.
[18:46.840 --> 18:53.600]  They have a hunger to conquer us because they don't have anything inside, and they're always
[18:53.600 --> 18:59.360]  trying to create a cataclysm or a crisis out of which they get power, and they've done
[18:59.360 --> 19:02.880]  it in Russia, and they did it in Nazi Germany, and they've done it in China, and it's the
[19:02.880 --> 19:08.400]  very same group of megabanks that financed the great wars of Napoleon and the British
[19:08.400 --> 19:09.400]  that are behind it.
[19:09.400 --> 19:15.160]  It's the Rothschilds 100%, and the Rothschilds are just the scum of the planet.
[19:15.160 --> 19:20.160]  It's the worst people you could ever imagine, and they're absolutely bloodthirsty.
[19:20.160 --> 19:24.960]  That doesn't mean all Rothschilds are, but the head Rothschild group, and the Rockefellers,
[19:24.960 --> 19:27.720]  and just all the names you know, it's them, man.
[19:27.720 --> 19:34.920]  They are just cold, blooded killers, and they're funding a giant, anti-human agenda.
[19:34.920 --> 19:37.800]  It's beyond racism, it's just death.
[19:37.800 --> 19:43.160]  It's a satanic agenda, kill, still, and destroy, and the names mean nothing, and they run the
[19:43.160 --> 19:48.800]  Catholic Church now, the globalists have got all the major players in place, and so they're
[19:48.800 --> 19:55.480]  making their world government move, and we're in a lot of trouble.
[19:55.480 --> 19:58.920]  And so denying this is only going to make things worse.
[19:58.920 --> 20:01.520]  We're going into planetary shutdown.
[20:01.520 --> 20:05.960]  The depression is already going to be really, really bad in the third world, very bad here.
[20:05.960 --> 20:09.560]  I don't know if they can turn things back on, and they don't want it turned back on.
[20:09.560 --> 20:13.600]  You started realizing that COVID-19 was a giant fraud, the German government's internal
[20:13.600 --> 20:17.880]  reports, the Interior Ministry said it's all regular deaths were being attributed.
[20:17.880 --> 20:24.100]  We have the same amount of deaths, this is a bad pneumonia, but it's man-made, so gates
[20:24.100 --> 20:25.600]  of them can own it.
[20:25.600 --> 20:27.680]  It's sick, they don't care.
[20:27.680 --> 20:29.520]  They're making their move.
[20:29.520 --> 20:31.640]  They're all in because they're slaves.
[20:31.640 --> 20:34.880]  Gates is a slave to this evil force.
[20:34.880 --> 20:41.480]  And so let me just say this, everyone else wants to be a follower.
[20:41.480 --> 20:47.120]  All these big police departments and governors are bowing to the looters.
[20:47.120 --> 20:51.520]  All these corporate systems are doing it because they were all put in place because they followed
[20:51.520 --> 20:52.720]  the corporates' directives.
[20:52.720 --> 20:57.640]  They're always sounded good, it sounded reasonable to get them over and over again to agree to
[20:57.640 --> 21:02.960]  what came into their inbox from the organizations and political groups that control them.
[21:02.960 --> 21:08.040]  And so now they've followed their orders so many times to do bad things that they are
[21:08.040 --> 21:14.960]  ready to bow, just like in the old Superman movie, to Zod.
[21:14.960 --> 21:18.920]  In fact, can you guys cue that promo up for the next segment?
[21:18.920 --> 21:22.280]  It's about submission to Islam, to all of it.
[21:22.280 --> 21:26.000]  And the cops are like, sure, I'm a confident good guy, my chief tells me to bow to some
[21:26.000 --> 21:29.920]  black people, but when you're bowing, you're not bowing to say I'm in solidarity.
[21:29.920 --> 21:30.920]  How about you shake somebody's hand?
[21:30.920 --> 21:32.400]  How about you get a cup of coffee with somebody?
[21:32.400 --> 21:33.760]  Or a bottle of barbecue?
[21:33.760 --> 21:34.760]  No.
[21:34.760 --> 21:41.320]  Instead, what you're doing is bowing to say you're bad, you're guilty of something because
[21:41.320 --> 21:45.560]  of the color of your skin, the inverse of what Martin Luther King said.
[21:45.560 --> 21:51.560]  This is so racist, so evil, so backward, so bad, and it's a war on Christianity and a
[21:51.560 --> 21:56.360]  war on the abolition movement, and it's a war to make us all tribal and kill each other.
[21:56.360 --> 22:01.880]  Because let me tell you, while controlled groups are bowing and saying I'm bad, I'm
[22:01.880 --> 22:10.040]  sorry I'm lying, because of what another white person did or didn't do, you are green-lighting
[22:10.040 --> 22:13.240]  this idea where everything is based on what color somebody is.
[22:13.240 --> 22:19.640]  It is unspeakably dangerous, unspeakably evil.
[22:19.640 --> 22:24.640]  So when you submit to a leftist in any way, at a job or at college or anywhere, when you
[22:24.640 --> 22:29.480]  give them your money, when you support Nike, when you support the chai comms, you might
[22:29.480 --> 22:34.760]  as well just cut your fingers off or stab yourself in the eye, or cut your balls off
[22:34.760 --> 22:38.040]  because that's what they're coming for is everything.
[22:38.040 --> 22:39.800]  The globalists do care about black people.
[22:39.800 --> 22:40.800]  They want to kill them.
[22:40.800 --> 22:43.200]  That's their favorite group.
[22:43.200 --> 22:44.320]  That's their testing group.
[22:44.320 --> 22:51.840]  And the very globalists that have been hammering Africans all over the world and doing a number
[22:51.840 --> 22:57.480]  on them psychologically as the beta tests are now saying they represent them while they
[22:57.480 --> 23:01.280]  lead them like a pied piper into the river to drown.
[23:01.280 --> 23:05.320]  I for one am not going to be part of this evil and I declare total war on the new world
[23:05.320 --> 23:10.580]  order and all their systems and any leftist I see, any trendy, I love it when they open
[23:10.580 --> 23:11.580]  their mouth in a restaurant.
[23:11.580 --> 23:13.080]  I love it when they try to intimidate me.
[23:13.080 --> 23:15.880]  In fact, when I just see them now, I get in their face just everywhere.
[23:15.880 --> 23:17.440]  I'm done.
[23:17.440 --> 23:26.120]  I'm not playing any games with any of these people because they are the enemy.
[23:26.120 --> 23:30.000]  You want to see incendiary footage, folks, I've got 50 videos of white people being
[23:30.000 --> 23:32.120]  shot, killed, beaten, tortured.
[23:32.120 --> 23:35.520]  I'm not even really getting into all those because I'm not even trying to inflame people.
[23:35.520 --> 23:39.480]  I'm trying to get folks to understand that above all this is an orchestrated group.
[23:39.480 --> 23:42.840]  There's an article in Fulwars saying there's some group orchestrating this.
[23:42.840 --> 23:49.040]  Yeah, we know Soros and the Rothschilds are on record doing it.
[23:49.040 --> 23:55.760]  I've got all their battle documents just like I've got.
[23:55.760 --> 24:00.760]  The man that died in Minnesota, George Floyd, on video, dropping what looks like fentanyl
[24:00.760 --> 24:01.760]  out of his pocket.
[24:01.760 --> 24:06.960]  I mean, we got it all at band.video, but the only way this truth gets out is when you tell
[24:06.960 --> 24:07.960]  the truth.
[24:07.960 --> 24:09.960]  Well, here's video you're not going to see on CNN or MSNBC.
[24:09.960 --> 24:11.600]  In fact, they're taking this off everywhere.
[24:11.600 --> 24:15.080]  There's a whole bunch of these videos.
[24:15.080 --> 24:18.200]  Black protesters catch white anti-famembers red-handed.
[24:18.200 --> 24:19.200]  Here it is.
[24:19.200 --> 24:20.200]  I can't believe it.
[24:20.200 --> 24:27.200]  I can't believe that they're circling.
[24:27.200 --> 24:41.520]  I want you to know this is not a black woman who's put in black lives matter.
[24:41.520 --> 24:49.760]  I just want you to know that we're doing that for us and we didn't ask you to do that.
[24:49.760 --> 24:57.560]  They're Batman in their $300 jeans, their $1,000 phones, they hate capitalism and they're
[24:57.560 --> 25:07.680]  saying we speak for blacks, spray painting and knocking out windows.
[25:07.680 --> 25:14.000]  All brainwashed their local college with their little pink purses.
[25:14.000 --> 25:15.000]  Let's go ahead and go to this video.
[25:15.000 --> 25:20.520]  This is the heavyweight champion of the world, UFC, John Jones, and he didn't put this out
[25:20.520 --> 25:21.520]  himself.
[25:21.520 --> 25:22.520]  He didn't want the attention.
[25:22.520 --> 25:28.040]  He saw people looting his town and burning up and attacking black white storage in his
[25:28.040 --> 25:29.040]  spray painting.
[25:29.040 --> 25:30.040]  He said, you're not doing that.
[25:30.040 --> 25:31.040]  Here it is.
[25:31.040 --> 25:32.040]  Albuquerque.
[25:32.040 --> 25:55.960]  This is Albuquerque, New Mexico.
[25:55.960 --> 25:58.560]  So he's out there covering the protest, looking at it.
[25:58.560 --> 25:59.560]  He's interested.
[25:59.560 --> 26:03.160]  He's got white methods and it's the truth, man.
[26:03.160 --> 26:07.000]  When I was down there this weekend and they were attacking our armored vehicle and attacking
[26:07.000 --> 26:12.400]  me and throwing bottles at me and steel rods that went right about my head, they were trying
[26:12.400 --> 26:13.760]  to kill me.
[26:13.760 --> 26:16.280]  It was all glow in the darks what my dad calls them.
[26:16.280 --> 26:19.600]  White people that never go out can almost have a green skin and they all looked all
[26:19.600 --> 26:23.040]  messed out and they'd get out of their cars and go, I'll beat your ass.
[26:23.040 --> 26:27.840]  I could literally take on 100 of them and I'm seriously just literally as much as I
[26:27.840 --> 26:30.440]  could punch them or just kick them, knock them over.
[26:30.440 --> 26:32.840]  I mean, if I'd have got out, I'm not bragging.
[26:32.840 --> 26:37.760]  I probably could have killed 20 of them with my bare hands and that's what these people
[26:37.760 --> 26:38.760]  are.
[26:38.760 --> 26:42.600]  It's truly disgusting, ladies and gentlemen, and then you've always got the token black
[26:42.600 --> 26:44.440]  guy there with their Black Lives Matter thing.
[26:44.440 --> 26:46.680]  I mean, these people are idiots.
[26:46.680 --> 26:49.960]  They have no idea what's going to happen if they actually breach that vehicle and got
[26:49.960 --> 26:50.960]  in there.
[26:50.960 --> 26:51.960]  I mean, there were a bunch of trained killers inside.
[26:51.960 --> 26:52.960]  We'll be right back.
[26:52.960 --> 26:53.960]  Stay with us.
[26:53.960 --> 26:59.320]  Now it's official, the United Nations came out yesterday and said the COVID emergency
[26:59.320 --> 27:05.440]  will last five years and the UK government said, you must all carry cell phones outside
[27:05.440 --> 27:10.160]  or you'll be arrested because we have to track your social distancing and you're only allowed
[27:10.160 --> 27:13.200]  to have a list of 10 people that you visit.
[27:13.200 --> 27:17.320]  And if you go outside that list of 10, you'll be permanently detained.
[27:17.320 --> 27:21.840]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is the new world order where they let the criminals
[27:21.840 --> 27:28.280]  out of jail, the rapists, the child molesters, the murderers, and where you are now non-essential
[27:28.280 --> 27:29.480]  and a prisoner.
[27:29.480 --> 27:33.040]  From the beginning of my research, it was clear the globalists are an authoritarian
[27:33.040 --> 27:34.600]  anti-human group.
[27:34.600 --> 27:39.880]  They have to put this electronic straightjacket on us before they carry out their end game,
[27:39.880 --> 27:42.120]  which is global depopulation.
[27:42.120 --> 27:45.640]  So you see, submitting to them is death.
[27:45.640 --> 27:51.560]  The only way to stop them is to expose them, to hate their guts and realize they are humanity's
[27:51.560 --> 27:53.040]  mortal enemy.
[27:53.040 --> 27:54.920]  Wake up or die.
[27:54.920 --> 27:59.560]  Feudalism in the ancient world from Asia to Europe, from Africa to Latin America, was
[27:59.560 --> 28:01.880]  the most common form of government.
[28:01.880 --> 28:06.960]  You had a ruling class, the nobility, the king and queen sitting on top of it, and the rest
[28:06.960 --> 28:11.880]  of the public were kept at a subsistence starving level for control.
[28:11.880 --> 28:16.360]  In fact, in most cultures, they called the peasants the little people because they were
[28:16.360 --> 28:22.520]  usually a foot or more shorter than the lords and ladies because they kept them again at
[28:22.520 --> 28:23.880]  a starving level.
[28:23.880 --> 28:28.520]  They were so busy trying to survive, they would never try to challenge the entrenched
[28:28.520 --> 28:29.520]  elite.
[28:29.520 --> 28:33.560]  Well, now all the big Google owners and the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds, the Jeff
[28:33.560 --> 28:34.720]  Bezos, is the world.
[28:34.720 --> 28:39.720]  They're sitting back on their giant estates with their jet helicopters and private jets
[28:39.720 --> 28:45.480]  living the life, laughing at you, shut down, going bankrupt in the third world, starving
[28:45.480 --> 28:46.480]  to death.
[28:46.480 --> 28:52.080]  Their religion is power and control, and they are pressing that advantage against us.
[28:52.080 --> 28:55.280]  We must break free from these monsters.
[28:55.280 --> 29:00.280]  The panic that has been orchestrated by the global corporatist media and the chai comms
[29:00.280 --> 29:04.000]  is going to now trigger a worldwide depression.
[29:04.000 --> 29:08.240]  In fact, we're already into the worldwide depression and the death sentence for the third
[29:08.240 --> 29:09.240]  world.
[29:09.240 --> 29:14.160]  But it's critical to understand that the longer the shutdown persists, the worse it's
[29:14.160 --> 29:15.400]  going to be.
[29:15.400 --> 29:20.600]  A month of shutdown will destroy decades of wealth that's been built up in a complex
[29:20.600 --> 29:21.600]  economy.
[29:21.600 --> 29:25.600]  That's why we've always said it's important to be a prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient
[29:25.600 --> 29:30.280]  because the globalists want to make us all dependent so that we're under their control.
[29:30.280 --> 29:32.720]  They've admitted all of this.
[29:32.720 --> 29:38.800]  So remember, how does infowars continue years and decades in many cases to be able to predict
[29:38.800 --> 29:43.720]  things before they happen because we're following the globalist blueprint and their battle
[29:43.720 --> 29:47.040]  plan and yes, it's dystopic and yes, it's scary.
[29:47.040 --> 29:51.200]  But denying it and letting them carry it out is a thousand times more scary.
[29:51.200 --> 30:17.200]  It's time to stop the denial and realize what's really happening.
[30:21.200 --> 30:28.400]  You are not the president.
[30:28.400 --> 30:33.040]  No one who leads so many could possibly kneel so quickly.
[30:33.040 --> 30:36.040]  I'm the man they're protecting.
[30:36.040 --> 30:56.760]  I'm the president.
[30:56.760 --> 31:01.640]  Kneeling is not a symbol of solidarity, hands shaking, but Fauci says, the UN says, don't
[31:01.640 --> 31:02.640]  ever do that again.
[31:02.640 --> 31:07.680]  You can't trust each other up behind glass barriers, can't go outside.
[31:07.680 --> 31:11.480]  But if you want to go out and riot and hurt a white person, well then it's virtuous because
[31:11.480 --> 31:17.920]  America is evil and this is a Marxist movement with a bunch of Harvard billionaires.
[31:17.920 --> 31:21.720]  Nike famously had the worst sweatshops in the world, slave camps.
[31:21.720 --> 31:27.760]  Now Apple has topped them with suicide nets and forced abortions and 18-hour work days.
[31:27.760 --> 31:32.920]  But again, Tim Cook is effeminate and literally just goes around going, I'm gay, I'm gay,
[31:32.920 --> 31:33.920]  seriously.
[31:33.920 --> 31:34.920]  He goes, gay, gay, gay.
[31:34.920 --> 31:35.920]  I'm going to go, oh God, you're gay.
[31:35.920 --> 31:36.920]  It's okay.
[31:36.920 --> 31:37.920]  You're on death camps.
[31:37.920 --> 31:39.520]  That's all this is, is a cover.
[31:39.520 --> 31:43.760]  I have death camps, but that's all this is, folks.
[31:43.760 --> 31:45.560]  That's why Gates wears a pink sweater.
[31:45.560 --> 31:48.040]  Oh, look, pink sweater.
[31:48.040 --> 31:52.360]  It's like John D. Rockefeller the first would hand out dimes to people and oh, I'm your friend.
[31:52.360 --> 31:53.920]  Let me hand you dimes.
[31:53.920 --> 31:58.760]  You all get something free, patronizing.
[31:58.760 --> 32:04.400]  And so we sit here and we watch this and our country's flooded with drugs and flooded with
[32:04.400 --> 32:06.960]  propaganda and flooded with evil culture.
[32:06.960 --> 32:11.760]  And things are just breaking down and people are lazy and stupid, old, young, black, white.
[32:11.760 --> 32:17.360]  We are a fallen country that's drunk on the blood of 62 million dead babies we've aborted.
[32:17.360 --> 32:24.680]  And now it's all over the news like, oh, the most human like mouse ever.
[32:24.680 --> 32:29.160]  And you look at it and it's a little human and they're just going, yeah, we made humans
[32:29.160 --> 32:30.160]  mice.
[32:30.160 --> 32:33.800]  Oh, and we've got, remember just five years ago, Jones is insane.
[32:33.800 --> 32:35.280]  It doesn't exist.
[32:35.280 --> 32:39.000]  Now it's like, oh, yeah, we're, we're gene editing babies and we've got a mouse that's
[32:39.000 --> 32:41.000]  80% human.
[32:41.000 --> 32:44.160]  Oh, but it doesn't have any rights.
[32:44.160 --> 32:45.640]  We medically test on it.
[32:45.640 --> 32:50.320]  But I meant to cover that you can put a little human face on the mouse and that's now just
[32:50.320 --> 32:56.640]  a kind of just a side issue, you know, because, because you know, George Floyd, he died.
[32:56.640 --> 33:01.960]  And there it is, human mouse hybrid hailed by top scientists is the most human yet.
[33:01.960 --> 33:06.400]  And they, they keep the Camero stuff quiet, but you can actually find the photos put up
[33:06.400 --> 33:09.320]  by some of the research labs and man, is it scary.
[33:09.320 --> 33:16.800]  In fact, put that up, notice it's called Cameros, there they are.
[33:16.800 --> 33:25.240]  Integrate developing mouse embryos and generate functional cells in mice, the postnatal mice.
[33:25.240 --> 33:34.200]  Oh, but George Floyd bombed out of his brain on fentanyl died.
[33:34.200 --> 33:45.040]  And so, oh, four cops shot in St. Louis, Vegas cop on live support, brain dead, other cops
[33:45.040 --> 33:47.080]  shot, but it's like, oh, that's a cop.
[33:47.080 --> 33:48.480]  We're not going to show them bleeding to death.
[33:48.480 --> 33:50.840]  We're not going to show them dead.
[33:50.840 --> 33:53.360]  We're just going to show you George Floyd.
[33:53.360 --> 33:57.560]  And then if you try to show the cops getting shot, Twitter and Facebook and Google, they
[33:57.560 --> 34:01.520]  all take it down.
[34:01.520 --> 34:05.760]  And then as society breaks down and the dogs come out and the military comes out, oh, the
[34:05.760 --> 34:11.760]  media is like, oh, the military is attacking its white people.
[34:11.760 --> 34:16.440]  To bring the country down to destroy your prosperity, destroy your future, America is
[34:16.440 --> 34:17.440]  fighting for its life.
[34:17.440 --> 34:21.240]  This is a chai, calm, globalist directed attack.
[34:21.240 --> 34:27.240]  Here, let's play this, this lady bowing to black lives matter funded by Soros funded
[34:27.240 --> 34:33.160]  by Nike, funded by Jeff Bezos on record, the guys that actually own slave factories where
[34:33.160 --> 34:37.280]  people are like locked up in containers at night, where a woman gets pregnant, they
[34:37.280 --> 34:38.280]  force abort.
[34:38.280 --> 34:43.920]  I mean, you're talking about prisoners, but it's like, oh, but it, it Jeff Bezos is at
[34:43.920 --> 34:45.760]  an eye that points the wrong direction.
[34:45.760 --> 34:48.760]  So it's okay.
[34:48.760 --> 34:56.040]  And you've got people living off the fumes of America, one of the most open free countries
[34:56.040 --> 34:57.320]  the world's ever seen.
[34:57.320 --> 34:59.760]  And boy, everybody's about to get a taste.
[34:59.760 --> 35:06.280]  If America goes down, they're going to beg and plead for it to come back, but it won't
[35:06.280 --> 35:12.000]  because you're a real slave now.
[35:12.000 --> 35:16.360]  And all the commies and all the people that one got two or three degrees that can't get
[35:16.360 --> 35:20.400]  a job, but are told once we overthrow America, you'll have a job as a new economy.
[35:20.400 --> 35:24.680]  They won't have a job or it won't be paid.
[35:24.680 --> 35:28.760]  But at least they'll be able to kick us around and believe me, but I'm going to these events.
[35:28.760 --> 35:29.760]  You see them.
[35:29.760 --> 35:32.120]  They go, we're going to take over, we're going to arrest you.
[35:32.120 --> 35:33.960]  We're going to kill your ass.
[35:33.960 --> 35:36.520]  No, that won't be you, my friend.
[35:36.520 --> 35:42.840]  You'll be the first people that are gotten rid of.
[35:42.840 --> 35:48.480]  I'll be put on a private jet and flown in for an audience with his lordship to finally
[35:48.480 --> 35:49.680]  see if I'll make a deal.
[35:49.680 --> 35:55.160]  I'll be served caviar while you're in a death camp, dumbass.
[35:55.160 --> 35:57.760]  But then I'll say no and I'll get killed on the spot.
[35:57.760 --> 36:00.480]  That's how it really works, dumbasses.
[36:00.480 --> 36:03.040]  The globalists don't collect you like baseball cards.
[36:03.040 --> 36:06.080]  They collect people like me, like baseball cards.
[36:06.080 --> 36:10.080]  They want me to join the new world order because I have value.
[36:10.080 --> 36:12.400]  You don't have value in their eyes.
[36:12.400 --> 36:17.560]  You're what they call a useless eater, a useful idiot.
[36:17.560 --> 36:20.000]  You're a dumbass.
[36:20.000 --> 36:27.480]  All you meth head white people with your degrees that are bagging groceries and you're mad that
[36:27.480 --> 36:32.200]  we won't pay your loans off because the very bankers that run you set your ass up.
[36:32.200 --> 36:42.360]  You can never admit that you were a chump.
[36:42.360 --> 36:43.640]  It's because you love lies.
[36:43.640 --> 36:44.840]  You love your father, the devil.
[36:44.840 --> 36:47.640]  That's why you're a loser.
[36:47.640 --> 36:48.920]  I'm done talking about that.
[36:48.920 --> 36:52.800]  You want the latest BS, the galactic level BS?
[36:52.800 --> 36:58.640]  This is on infowars.com and newswars.com along with the other great video with John Jones
[36:58.640 --> 36:59.640]  out there.
[36:59.640 --> 37:02.760]  You're not going to see that black man out there trying to stop riots because that's
[37:02.760 --> 37:03.760]  not the image.
[37:03.760 --> 37:05.320]  That's not the hero they want.
[37:05.320 --> 37:11.320]  The hero is the meth head getting black people to break into business.
[37:11.320 --> 37:14.320]  Only way that video gets out is you share it, infowars.com.
[37:14.320 --> 37:15.320]  What are you going to do?
[37:15.320 --> 37:21.560]  Obama national security advisor claims Russia is funding rioting in the U.S. with no proof
[37:21.560 --> 37:23.640]  with Wolf Blitzer on CNN.
[37:23.640 --> 37:25.640]  The Democrats are all endorsing it.
[37:25.640 --> 37:26.920]  They're saying it's great.
[37:26.920 --> 37:30.600]  They're saying go out and riot and then they turn around and they say, but Russia runs
[37:30.600 --> 37:41.240]  it and San Antonio radio stations, San Antonio TV, Dallas, Austin, the BBC, RT are all saying
[37:41.240 --> 37:44.640]  Alex Jones burned down the homeless camp.
[37:44.640 --> 37:46.000]  Doesn't matter we got all the raw footage.
[37:46.000 --> 37:47.000]  We didn't do it.
[37:47.000 --> 37:48.440]  Doesn't matter where they're covering it.
[37:48.440 --> 37:50.800]  They all see because I'm the establishment, right?
[37:50.800 --> 37:53.000]  I'm the one burning down the homeless camps.
[37:53.000 --> 37:58.320]  That's what I do in my free time because the antifa methods, they couldn't ever do anything
[37:58.320 --> 37:59.320]  wrong.
[37:59.320 --> 38:03.200]  We're going to go to break and come back with that and oh, Zuckerberg claimed he was going
[38:03.200 --> 38:04.200]  to censor Trump.
[38:04.200 --> 38:05.200]  Oh, now he is.
[38:05.200 --> 38:09.560]  Oh, Trump's so fascist calling out the military, Zuckerberg's going to have to shut Trump.
[38:09.560 --> 38:14.240]  Oh, see, now the fight really comes down to the line because who's Zuckerberg work for?
[38:14.240 --> 38:17.560]  Bill Gates and who's Gates work for?
[38:17.560 --> 38:18.560]  You bet.
[38:18.560 --> 38:19.560]  Satan, maybe Satan.
[38:19.560 --> 38:20.560]  We're going to break them.
[38:20.560 --> 38:21.560]  We're going to come back.
[38:21.560 --> 38:30.160]  I just want everybody to know this is the biggest sale we've done in a year.
[38:30.160 --> 38:32.280]  Most of these products have never been 60% off.
[38:32.280 --> 38:33.920]  A lot of these products are 60% off.
[38:33.920 --> 38:35.840]  We might be making five, 10% on them.
[38:35.840 --> 38:38.360]  A lot of them, nothing, but I just know things are so bad.
[38:38.360 --> 38:43.200]  My gut level is just liquidate everything and a bunch of stuff is about to sell out.
[38:43.200 --> 38:47.120]  So I just get money in to operate the next six, seven months, the next 150 some days
[38:47.120 --> 38:51.760]  because it's it's maker to break at time and our reserves are not at the point they need
[38:51.760 --> 38:56.000]  to be to just be able to cover this and have the security we need and go around the country.
[38:56.000 --> 38:57.000]  So I'm just all in.
[38:57.000 --> 39:01.800]  I'm actually hiring more people right now and just just total afterburners, full commitment,
[39:01.800 --> 39:03.040]  ramming speed.
[39:03.040 --> 39:05.600]  We're on it like Donkey Kong.
[39:05.600 --> 39:09.800]  So 60% off across the board, flash sale, infowars.com.
[39:09.800 --> 39:12.680]  Our biggest sale of the year was 60% off top products.
[39:12.680 --> 39:13.680]  Will it in today?
[39:13.680 --> 39:14.680]  Will it in tomorrow?
[39:14.680 --> 39:16.640]  You know, I'm so busy fighting the whole new world order.
[39:16.640 --> 39:17.640]  I don't know.
[39:17.640 --> 39:20.240]  I haven't had time to come up with a new promo and I'm running out of a lot of the best sellers
[39:20.240 --> 39:21.840]  and I don't know what to do.
[39:21.840 --> 39:22.840]  I'm out of options.
[39:22.840 --> 39:25.280]  So we're just going to keep selling till it sells out.

[39:59.320 --> 40:02.100]  we're having to end that one because a bunch of items are selling out.
[40:02.100 --> 40:06.760]  But all the items we have left in stock are still on record sale and then five items that

[40:58.760 --> 41:00.680]  but worldwide Maverick spirit.
[41:00.680 --> 41:06.120]  It's not just myself or the host at Infowars or the researchers or the journalists.
[41:06.120 --> 41:10.600]  It's you, the listeners, the activists, the people on the front lines in the arena.
[41:10.600 --> 41:16.560]  And it's the amazing guests and individuals that we interview that make Infowars so special
[41:16.560 --> 41:19.600]  because we're not putting a filter in front of free minds.
[41:19.600 --> 41:24.600]  We're having an open discussion about the real, stable, the world, not the establishment
[41:24.600 --> 41:28.000]  and talking points that are put out by the council in front of relations, the Boulder
[41:28.000 --> 41:31.160]  Burton Group, the Davos Group and other club lists.
[41:31.160 --> 41:37.200]  We're pushing for a pro human future where we build a planet and beyond based on humans,
[41:37.200 --> 41:42.920]  poor humans, by humans, not a world where the establishment hate themselves, project
[41:42.920 --> 41:46.760]  their hate onto us and decide we're going to have a post human world.
[41:46.760 --> 41:50.960]  I'm excited to know that Infowars has your support and I want to thank you all for being
[41:50.960 --> 41:55.200]  pro human and pro God.
[41:55.200 --> 41:59.880]  What Infowars has been able to do thanks to your support and your prayers and your word
[41:59.880 --> 42:05.120]  of mouth has been nothing short of historic and truly epic.
[42:05.120 --> 42:12.480]  This is the battle for the future of humanity and now open world government is being established
[42:12.480 --> 42:16.240]  with an end game to depopulate the planet.
[42:16.240 --> 42:22.680]  Now the internal operations of the globalists are being externalized, you must decide which
[42:22.680 --> 42:23.680]  side you're on.
[42:23.680 --> 42:30.400]  Living in denial, having mass Stockholm syndrome, Murdoch will only deliver you into misery,
[42:30.400 --> 42:32.400]  destruction and finally death.
[42:32.400 --> 42:38.280]  And this is a spiritual death we're talking about, not just a physical death, the delusions
[42:38.280 --> 42:40.440]  must end now.
[42:40.440 --> 42:45.800]  Infowars was correct about it all and we have come so far by exposing the enemy.
[42:45.800 --> 42:49.520]  The people that are aware of the new world will decide to join it out of fear.
[42:49.520 --> 42:55.600]  They are truly fools, we must fight this or lose our souls.
[42:55.600 --> 43:00.480]  The United States is not communist China, we don't have three million people in concentration
[43:00.480 --> 43:06.240]  camps, we don't blow up churches, we don't kill political dissidents and sell their organs.
[43:06.240 --> 43:12.440]  But all of the news, we see the UN, billable indigates, WHO, mainstream corporate media
[43:12.440 --> 43:17.880]  praising communist China for their response and if communist China shoots women at checkpoints
[43:17.880 --> 43:22.240]  and welds people into their houses and has robots controlling people, well then gee we've
[43:22.240 --> 43:23.240]  got to do that.
[43:23.240 --> 43:27.240]  And on top of it, cities like San Antonio pass laws saying we'll arrest you if you say
[43:27.240 --> 43:28.240]  Chinese virus.
[43:28.240 --> 43:32.120]  Well now Cuomo in New York is calling it the European virus.
[43:32.120 --> 43:37.320]  These people are out of control, control freaks and they are going to lose big time because
[43:37.320 --> 43:41.520]  we the people are aware of their criminal activities and are exposing them in their power
[43:41.520 --> 43:42.520]  grab.
[43:42.520 --> 43:48.760]  The resistance lives at band.video and infowars.com, spread those links and jam it down the censor's
[43:48.760 --> 43:57.640]  throats and then we'll be able to defeat their operation that much quicker.
[43:57.640 --> 44:21.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[44:21.800 --> 44:22.800]  Welcome back.
[44:22.800 --> 44:29.440]  Massive news breaking and infowars.com that is so critical and welcome back on your host
[44:29.440 --> 44:30.960]  Alex Jones.
[44:30.960 --> 44:35.360]  The globalist are always about titrating the dose of the poison.
[44:35.360 --> 44:39.880]  You can take cobra poison or other snake poison and slowly build up the amount of your system
[44:39.880 --> 44:42.240]  till you become quasi immune to it.
[44:42.240 --> 44:45.280]  You can take a much bigger dose that would kill a normal person.
[44:45.280 --> 44:46.800]  But see the weather psychology works.
[44:46.800 --> 44:50.960]  The globalist personally have told me in one conversation I've talked about a lot of it
[44:50.960 --> 44:53.560]  that you don't get it, Jones.
[44:53.560 --> 45:00.240]  The public adapts to enslavement and so instead of the titrated dose going up, making them
[45:00.240 --> 45:03.640]  resist, it makes them submit.
[45:03.640 --> 45:08.840]  And so all the censorship, all the control now in the browsers, in the private text messages,
[45:08.840 --> 45:15.120]  which means they're surveilling you, that's totally illegal, separate from the censorship.
[45:15.120 --> 45:23.800]  Now Apple that has three million Uighurs in China, many of them in death camps, mainstream
[45:23.800 --> 45:27.520]  news admits that they're making components for iPhones.
[45:27.520 --> 45:33.240]  And then in mainland China, or in the heart of China, old China as they call it, you have
[45:33.240 --> 45:39.000]  slavery going on and suicide nets and forced drugging and just stuff beyond any nightmare
[45:39.000 --> 45:42.960]  you've ever imagined.
[45:42.960 --> 45:47.920]  And now, in solidarity to push this, it's not just Nike and Amazon Virtue signaling
[45:47.920 --> 45:55.280]  as they get looted, Apple freezes browser feature of MusicApp and replaces it with F,
[45:55.280 --> 46:01.680]  the police playlist from NWA.
[46:01.680 --> 46:05.240]  So yeah, that was fun to listen to when I was 12 years old too.
[46:05.240 --> 46:11.560]  The point is, is that this is a mega corporation, super cold-blooded, scientifically taking
[46:11.560 --> 46:17.600]  over the planet, and they want you to believe that they're the super cool trendies that,
[46:17.600 --> 46:19.120]  you know, F the police.
[46:19.120 --> 46:22.000]  And what does the F the police mean?
[46:22.000 --> 46:24.240]  It means local elected government.
[46:24.240 --> 46:30.720]  This is a global, technotronic, technocracy coming in like a giant alien mothership, blocking
[46:30.720 --> 46:32.920]  out the sun over our cities.
[46:32.920 --> 46:38.560]  And it's like, I will teach you to be free, kill your police, overthrow and burn your
[46:38.560 --> 46:45.440]  infrastructure because America was deep into the new world order.
[46:45.440 --> 46:49.880]  The Chinese century was here and we said, no, actually, we don't want to jump in the
[46:49.880 --> 46:51.880]  oven.
[46:51.880 --> 46:53.600]  We don't want to jump in the wood chipper.
[46:53.600 --> 46:54.600]  We don't want to go bye-bye.
[46:54.600 --> 47:00.320]  And so they went, oh, you're Russian agents because they're the globalists that want to
[47:00.320 --> 47:02.600]  say no borders, no wall, no USA at all.
[47:02.600 --> 47:04.200]  They're the ones that say get rid of the country.
[47:04.200 --> 47:08.320]  They're the ones that say America's permanently broken and it's over all over the news.
[47:08.320 --> 47:09.400]  We're depressed.
[47:09.400 --> 47:10.400]  We're done.
[47:10.400 --> 47:11.400]  It's all over.
[47:11.400 --> 47:14.320]  And anybody that signs on to this is going into real slavery.
[47:14.320 --> 47:16.080]  I don't care what color you are.
[47:16.080 --> 47:23.960]  So now Obama's national security advisor has climbed out from under Iraq after 78 days of
[47:23.960 --> 47:27.600]  having his lockdown under martial law.
[47:27.600 --> 47:31.840]  In a bizarre claim, Barack Obama's former national security advisor, Susan Rice said
[47:31.840 --> 47:36.600]  that the rioting and violence being witnessed in major cities is right out of the Russian
[47:36.600 --> 47:37.600]  playbook.
[47:37.600 --> 47:43.240]  Susan goes on to say that the Russians are doing this with no proof.
[47:43.240 --> 47:47.040]  After locking our government up for three years with Russia's gatecraft, they're back.
[47:47.040 --> 47:48.480]  It's not the Democrat governors.
[47:48.480 --> 47:52.200]  It's not the Democrat police chiefs like Art Acevedo saying, how dare you be mean to brown
[47:52.200 --> 47:53.200]  people?
[47:53.200 --> 47:54.200]  It's our country.
[47:54.200 --> 47:55.200]  The whites are the enemy.
[47:55.200 --> 48:03.200]  I mean, whoa, in Houston, oh, it's not the virtue signaling.
[48:03.200 --> 48:05.760]  It's not the media with all the race war movies.
[48:05.760 --> 48:06.760]  None of that.
[48:06.760 --> 48:10.040]  It's not Antifa burning down the homeless campus, Alex Jones.
[48:10.040 --> 48:11.640]  Why you see it all to the news?
[48:11.640 --> 48:12.640]  No proof.
[48:12.640 --> 48:17.720]  They just say I did it because they're going for a broke because we're loyal Americans
[48:17.720 --> 48:21.520]  that care about everybody and just want justice and freedom and we're Christian.
[48:21.520 --> 48:25.760]  And so Susan Rice climbs out from under her rock, obviously always drugged out of her
[48:25.760 --> 48:31.040]  damn mind, just a front person for these people.
[48:31.040 --> 48:34.920]  And she's saying the Russians, the Russians.
[48:34.920 --> 48:38.040]  The Chinese government is praising the rioters.
[48:38.040 --> 48:41.320]  The Chinese government is all over Twitter, not being fact checked.
[48:41.320 --> 48:45.400]  The Iranian government, but the president's being banned.
[48:45.400 --> 48:49.440]  And we just sit here while the president can't communicate in modern communication systems
[48:49.440 --> 48:52.120]  and we're totally shut down, except for your word of mouth.
[48:52.120 --> 48:53.280]  Ball moves down the field.
[48:53.280 --> 48:59.080]  When you share the link at band.video, the power you've got is the power to destroy them
[48:59.080 --> 49:00.080]  now.
[49:00.080 --> 49:04.160]  And when are you going to wake up that it's not Kansas anymore, that it's not a game?
[49:04.160 --> 49:05.160]  It's just real.
[49:05.160 --> 49:06.640]  Info wars is real.
[49:06.640 --> 49:07.640]  You're real.
[49:07.640 --> 49:09.760]  I'm real.
[49:09.760 --> 49:13.200]  And now that they've destabilized and Trump's got to launch the troops, he knows they're
[49:13.200 --> 49:14.920]  setting him up.
[49:14.920 --> 49:16.080]  The troops are going to kill some people.
[49:16.080 --> 49:17.240]  That's what they do.
[49:17.240 --> 49:22.600]  And now it's going to be, oh, Trump, martial law, when he didn't want the martial law and
[49:22.600 --> 49:24.000]  they made him instituted.
[49:24.000 --> 49:32.760]  You're going to look back, folks, if we lose this and you're going to wish to hell you
[49:32.760 --> 49:38.080]  spread the word, you got involved now, all the candy ass churches, everybody on the fence.
[49:38.080 --> 49:39.520]  God said you were hot nor cold.
[49:39.520 --> 49:41.080]  I spit you out of my mouth.
[49:41.080 --> 49:45.800]  Get off the fence.
[49:45.800 --> 49:47.200]  Get off the pot, man.
[49:47.200 --> 49:49.000]  Take a dump or get off of it.
[49:49.000 --> 49:54.880]  But I'm here to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, you're getting Bolshevik revolution right
[49:54.880 --> 49:58.400]  now and they're going to put you in a camp and they're going to torture the living hell
[49:58.400 --> 49:59.400]  out of you.
[49:59.400 --> 50:04.400]  Because that's all these people want to do is gouge your eyeballs out.
[50:04.400 --> 50:08.920]  And as soon as you figure that out, you're going to grow up.
[50:08.920 --> 50:11.240]  But boy, everybody knows why we got guns.
[50:11.240 --> 50:15.480]  And that's the good part about it is we're not like the poor Russians or the poor Chinese
[50:15.480 --> 50:19.600]  that were surfs before who didn't really have a long history of being free and who were
[50:19.600 --> 50:24.000]  always being attacked by outside forces so they never got their own solidarity.
[50:24.000 --> 50:29.560]  This place still has an armed camp and we still know what's going on.
[50:29.560 --> 50:31.200]  And so I got news for the New World Order.
[50:31.200 --> 50:37.240]  You better run your asses to Switzerland and New Zealand and Kauai, Hawaii, because you're
[50:37.240 --> 50:43.120]  going to fail and you can launch and try to get everybody else, Zuckerberg and Tim Cook
[50:43.120 --> 50:47.280]  to go kill people and kill the cops and all that have the government break down and bow
[50:47.280 --> 50:48.760]  to you and kneel to you.
[50:48.760 --> 50:50.760]  It's not going to happen.
[50:50.760 --> 50:56.600]  And I assure you that you're going to pay severely for what you've done.
[50:56.600 --> 51:00.200]  And Bill Gates is going to pay severely for what he's done.
[51:00.200 --> 51:06.000]  And worth Rothschild is going to pay severely for what you've done.
[51:06.000 --> 51:07.440]  You're politically defeated.
[51:07.440 --> 51:08.560]  And I think you know that.
[51:08.560 --> 51:12.160]  That's why you're trying to overturn everything and overturn the chessboard.
[51:12.160 --> 51:16.000]  But there could be 1% of thinking people you're still going to lose.
[51:16.000 --> 51:18.040]  It's more like 30% now.
[51:18.040 --> 51:19.560]  And the word's spreading really fast.
[51:19.560 --> 51:21.800]  Your whole COVID blew up in your face.
[51:21.800 --> 51:25.280]  So the big question we got asked listeners is, what is their next fiasco?
[51:25.280 --> 51:33.200]  Mass shootings, race war, maybe a stronger bio weapon, economic collapse, physical war
[51:33.200 --> 51:38.680]  with China over Taiwan, Hong Kong, assassination of the president.
[51:38.680 --> 51:40.560]  I mean, anything could happen right now.
[51:40.560 --> 51:41.560]  Get ready, folks.
[51:41.560 --> 51:43.120]  You're not in a normal period anymore.
[51:43.120 --> 51:45.120]  The games are over.
[51:45.120 --> 51:49.040]  You're as helpless as a baby in their mother's womb when that Planned Parenthood death
[51:49.040 --> 51:53.440]  operator is coming to kill unless you start speaking out that you sit there like a baby
[51:53.440 --> 51:55.200]  in the womb.
[51:55.200 --> 51:56.920]  That baby didn't have a chance to fight.
[51:56.920 --> 51:58.160]  You've got a chance to fight.
[51:58.160 --> 52:02.960]  Are you going to fight or are you going to sit there and kiss ass all day?
[52:02.960 --> 52:09.800]  So here's Susan Rice looking like she's loaded like a freight train, flying like an aeroplane
[52:09.800 --> 52:15.080]  telling us that the Russians are the ones doing it when the own damn channel she's
[52:15.080 --> 52:16.560]  on pushing the thing.
[52:16.560 --> 52:17.560]  Here it is.
[52:17.560 --> 52:24.200]  We've come to try to hijack those protests and turn them into something very different.
[52:24.200 --> 52:30.000]  And they are probably also, I would bet based on my experience, I'm not reading the intelligence
[52:30.000 --> 52:35.320]  today or these days, but based on my experience, this is right out of the Russian playbook
[52:35.320 --> 52:36.320]  as well.
[52:36.320 --> 52:42.000]  But we can allow the extremists, the foreign actors to distract from the real problems we
[52:42.000 --> 52:48.280]  have in this country that are long standing centuries old and need to be addressed responsibly
[52:48.280 --> 52:49.280]  by new.
[52:49.280 --> 52:54.080]  So these are all CIA leftist foundation folks that they're sociologists and they just anthropologists
[52:54.080 --> 52:56.640]  and they look at the culture and they play it off against each other.
[52:56.640 --> 53:01.840]  What a sickening evil woman who supports radical Islam, all the rest of it.
[53:01.840 --> 53:02.920]  She's a dirt bag.
[53:02.920 --> 53:03.920]  She's an elitist.
[53:03.920 --> 53:05.480]  She loves playing people off.
[53:05.480 --> 53:07.960]  She loves the public not being informed.
[53:07.960 --> 53:13.280]  And then she just goes on into how the Russians are running everything.
[53:13.280 --> 53:15.240]  That's all she's got because she's the globalist.
[53:15.240 --> 53:16.680]  She's the anti-American.
[53:16.680 --> 53:18.520]  She's the person wants to get rid of the country.
[53:18.520 --> 53:19.520]  She's the enemy.
[53:19.520 --> 53:23.760]  So she's all, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, the Russians are doing all this.
[53:23.760 --> 53:24.760]  You're doing it.
[53:24.760 --> 53:25.760]  Rice.
[53:25.760 --> 53:26.760]  And we all know it.
[53:26.760 --> 53:30.240]  You dirty piece of crap.
[53:30.240 --> 53:34.000]  You got to deal with God though, you ugly witch.
[53:34.000 --> 53:36.160]  Okay.
[53:36.160 --> 53:41.560]  This Apple thing though is unbelievable folks info wars.com.
[53:41.560 --> 53:42.560]  And I went and checked it.
[53:42.560 --> 53:46.360]  They've literally hijacked the browsers of the, of the Apple app that over a hundred
[53:46.360 --> 53:52.080]  million people last time I checked out and are, and are playing kill the police, basically
[53:52.080 --> 53:53.080]  music.
[53:53.080 --> 53:56.640]  And yeah, it's all just like, oh, oh, wow, look, solidarity.
[53:56.640 --> 53:57.640]  Let's go kill cops.
[53:57.640 --> 54:02.400]  Why, why the biggest corporation in the world told me to the don't slave camps.
[54:02.400 --> 54:07.240]  Yes, sir, Tim Cook and Trump's up there with Kushner telling him, Tim Cook's his friend,
[54:07.240 --> 54:13.160]  you know, Apple is a technocracy stuff doesn't happen unless Tim Cook says it.
[54:13.160 --> 54:17.560]  Tim Cook said two years ago in Beijing, he said, I want to help you censor and I want
[54:17.560 --> 54:18.560]  to censor Americans.
[54:18.560 --> 54:26.240]  He's a BDI drug addict who's going to burn in hell.
[54:26.240 --> 54:30.960]  And not because he sticks his tallywacker or other men, but because he hates humanity
[54:30.960 --> 54:38.800]  and runs death camps, burn in hell, Tim Cook, burn in hell, you maggot, burn in hell, you
[54:38.800 --> 54:44.720]  little turd.
[54:44.720 --> 54:46.960]  This is the end of my friends.
[54:46.960 --> 54:52.880]  My only friends, the end of our elaborate plans, the end of everything that stands,
[54:52.880 --> 54:57.480]  the end of safety, the delusion.
[54:57.480 --> 55:03.800]  It's all over, ladies and gentlemen, because it was only the mirage of safety, movies and
[55:03.800 --> 55:09.280]  partying and living like children, never growing up, never caring about other people.
[55:09.280 --> 55:14.360]  This delivered us into the hands of tyranny, just like the history book shows, just like
[55:14.360 --> 55:15.880]  the Bible states.
[55:15.880 --> 55:20.120]  Every time Israel became corrupt and evil and turned away from God, they were brought
[55:20.120 --> 55:25.880]  into captivity because their people sold out to special interest and were infiltrated
[55:25.880 --> 55:28.880]  by spies, and then they were enslaved.
[55:28.880 --> 55:34.560]  We are repeating that again today, compliance and going along with this system leads to
[55:34.560 --> 55:37.040]  absolute bondage.
[55:37.040 --> 55:41.120]  Info Wars has decided to fight for freedom, and Info Wars has had great victory thanks
[55:41.120 --> 55:45.800]  to your support and your prayers.
[55:45.800 --> 55:51.720]  As I record this announcement, there's only one week left in the biggest sale yet of 2020.
[55:51.720 --> 55:57.760]  We will not have this sale that's coming on right now in May until our Christmas sale
[55:57.760 --> 55:58.760]  comes up.

[56:05.760 --> 56:09.960]  Let me just hone in on one of the products, DNA Force Plus.
[56:09.960 --> 56:15.120]  It's got high-quality PQQ, CoQ10, and a bunch of other natural ingredients that are known
[56:15.120 --> 56:17.560]  to supercharge the effects of that.
[56:17.560 --> 56:23.120]  Then what PQQ and CoQ10 can do for you, no matter how old you are, no matter what color
[56:23.120 --> 56:27.920]  you are, no matter where you live in the world, it works the same on everybody.
[56:27.920 --> 56:30.480]  It's known to be able to regrow nerves.
[56:30.480 --> 56:33.880]  It's designed so that your telomeres last longer.
[56:33.880 --> 56:38.480]  Doesn't make them grow, makes them shrink slower, which is basically the same thing.
[56:38.480 --> 56:47.520]  DNA Force Plus is 50 percent off for a limited time at infowarstore.com.
[56:47.520 --> 56:54.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[56:54.520 --> 57:10.000]  The left, Soros, the globalists, the chikoms, trying to fund martial law in America.
[57:10.000 --> 57:18.560]  President Trump is a con man and the ultimate narcissist who wants the world to revolve
[57:18.560 --> 57:20.320]  around him.
[57:20.320 --> 57:27.120]  It's fascinating to me that George Soros has a foundation dedicated to political activism,
[57:27.120 --> 57:35.440]  left-wing activism, anti-American activism, I believe in many examples, and he gets to
[57:35.440 --> 57:38.640]  do it through a tax-exempt foundation.
[57:38.640 --> 57:39.640]  What are you?
[57:39.640 --> 57:40.640]  Are you kidding me?
[57:40.640 --> 57:46.360]  Yeah, and isn't it amazing that you have these smallish Tea Party groups that get persecuted,
[57:46.360 --> 57:52.520]  prosecuted by the IRS, but I've never heard George Soros even have a nasty letter from
[57:52.520 --> 57:54.880]  the IRS for all this political activity.
[57:54.880 --> 57:58.640]  He's running through a C3 foundation.
[57:58.640 --> 58:02.640]  So that when buildings are being burnt down, people are being killed, security guards at
[58:02.640 --> 58:07.560]  federal buildings are being shot dead, the media gives it almost no coverage.
[58:07.560 --> 58:14.080]  So that when local and federal government responds, they can tell the public this is
[58:14.080 --> 58:16.800]  tyranny, attack them.
[58:16.800 --> 58:21.440]  President Trump and Attorney General William Barr blame left-wing anarchist groups for
[58:21.440 --> 58:23.160]  the national violence.
[58:23.160 --> 58:25.080]  And Barr delivered a warning.
[58:25.080 --> 58:30.000]  After both Minnesota's Democratic Governor Tim Walz and President Trump suggested some
[58:30.000 --> 58:35.880]  demonstrators in Minnesota were out-of-state antagonists, claims they did not back up with
[58:35.880 --> 58:44.400]  evidence.
[58:44.400 --> 58:46.560]  This is an attempt to trigger a civil war.
[58:46.560 --> 58:52.440]  The globalists can't defeat America, but they can trick us to fight each other over
[58:52.440 --> 58:55.000]  made-up or exaggerated issues they win.
[58:55.000 --> 58:58.160]  What should the President of the United States be doing right now?
[58:58.160 --> 59:02.640]  President of the United States should bring dignity to the office that he serves.
[59:02.640 --> 59:06.080]  He should be a unifying force in our country.
[59:06.080 --> 59:11.400]  We have seen that with Democratic and Republican presidents all along.
[59:11.400 --> 59:17.880]  They have seen their responsibility to be the President of the United States to unify
[59:17.880 --> 59:23.320]  our country and not to fuel the flame, not to fuel the flame.
[59:23.320 --> 59:28.920]  And I think to take his bait time and time again is just a gift to him because he always
[59:28.920 --> 59:35.880]  wants to divert attention from what the cause of the response was rather than to describe
[59:35.880 --> 59:58.040]  it in his own terms.
[59:58.040 --> 1:00:21.720]  This is what
[1:00:21.720 --> 1:00:27.360]  Soros and the globalists are conjuring is the actual military, the actual police, and
[1:00:27.360 --> 1:00:31.160]  they use a bunch of meth-head idiots out there to poke the bear to do it, and these
[1:00:31.160 --> 1:00:32.840]  people are ordered to go out and clear the streets.
[1:00:32.840 --> 1:00:33.840]  What's going to happen?
[1:00:33.840 --> 1:00:34.840]  A disaster.
[1:00:34.840 --> 1:00:36.340]  The cops arrested.
[1:00:36.340 --> 1:00:37.340]  He's indicted.
[1:00:37.340 --> 1:00:40.600]  So what's all this in so-called rioting about?
[1:00:40.600 --> 1:00:41.600]  It's not about injustice.
[1:00:41.600 --> 1:00:44.120]  It's not about standing up for what's right.
[1:00:44.120 --> 1:00:47.240]  It's about control and power, and it's all led.
[1:00:47.240 --> 1:00:52.440]  If you go out on the LA streets or the Austin streets or the Minnesota streets, I've been
[1:00:52.440 --> 1:00:56.640]  on the Texas streets the last two days, but I see the videos from all over the country
[1:00:56.640 --> 1:00:57.640]  man.
[1:00:57.640 --> 1:01:00.840]  It's a bunch of white people, and I'm not trying to bash white people, but you know
[1:01:00.840 --> 1:01:01.840]  what?
[1:01:01.840 --> 1:01:02.840]  We don't have a Mexican problem.
[1:01:02.840 --> 1:01:04.800]  We don't have a black person problem.
[1:01:04.800 --> 1:01:30.800]  We got a white crackhead problem.
[1:01:30.800 --> 1:01:56.680]  Spending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[1:01:56.680 --> 1:02:02.160]  emergency will last five years and the UK government said you must all carry
[1:02:02.160 --> 1:02:05.960]  cell phones outside or you'll be arrested because we have to track your
[1:02:05.960 --> 1:02:10.120]  social distancing and you're only allowed to have a list of 10 people that
[1:02:10.120 --> 1:02:14.800]  you visit and if you go outside that list of 10 you'll be permanently detained.
[1:02:14.800 --> 1:02:19.720]  Yes ladies and gentlemen this is the new world order where they let the criminals
[1:02:19.720 --> 1:02:23.960]  out of jail, the rapists, the child molesters, the murderers and where you
[1:02:23.960 --> 1:02:28.940]  are now non-essential and a prisoner. From the beginning of my research it was
[1:02:28.940 --> 1:02:33.600]  clear the globalist are an authoritarian anti-human group. They have to put this
[1:02:33.600 --> 1:02:38.120]  electronic straightjacket on us before they carry out their end game which is
[1:02:38.120 --> 1:02:44.960]  global depopulation. So you see submitting to them is death. The only way to stop
[1:02:44.960 --> 1:02:49.560]  them is to expose them, to hate their guts and realize they are humanity's
[1:02:49.560 --> 1:02:53.880]  mortal enemy. Wake up or die.
[1:02:59.200 --> 1:03:05.360]  Clashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones coming to
[1:03:05.360 --> 1:03:10.280]  you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[1:03:10.280 --> 1:03:20.920]  You know when the enemies launch in an attack because you see the propaganda
[1:03:20.920 --> 1:03:25.440]  increase you see movement on the street. The major corporations that are
[1:03:25.440 --> 1:03:28.400]  globalists think they can conquer every nation-state that want hegemonic
[1:03:28.400 --> 1:03:33.400]  planetary control. Allied with Communist China are making their move right now and
[1:03:33.400 --> 1:03:40.080]  they are lying at levels never before seen because they're behaving like it's
[1:03:40.080 --> 1:03:43.160]  the end of the world because it is the end of their globalist system if they
[1:03:43.160 --> 1:03:47.400]  lose and that's why Trump's got to act decisively to shut all this down because
[1:03:47.400 --> 1:03:50.720]  they're just gonna keep escalating what they're doing to the point of
[1:03:50.720 --> 1:03:54.680]  destruction and war if the collaborators with Communist China and the
[1:03:54.680 --> 1:04:00.480]  globalist are not dealt with and I mean decapitated however the
[1:04:00.480 --> 1:04:05.440]  constitutionally elected executive branch sees fit this is the the wheel
[1:04:05.440 --> 1:04:11.560]  house we're in right now all Apple audio devices with the stream music I've been
[1:04:11.560 --> 1:04:16.360]  taken over with F the police kill the police menus that's all being done by
[1:04:16.360 --> 1:04:21.360]  Tim Cook that own slave factories in China there I just had my daughter call
[1:04:21.360 --> 1:04:24.680]  me my oldest daughter she goes dad it's all over Twitter and I looks being
[1:04:24.680 --> 1:04:30.520]  force fed on the Twitter old Jane Doe fake lawsuits fake lawsuits in Houston
[1:04:30.520 --> 1:04:36.480]  and in New York City with women that don't exist saying Trump raped them with
[1:04:36.480 --> 1:04:39.840]  Jeffrey Epstein back when it was coming out the Clintons had been involved and
[1:04:39.840 --> 1:04:43.160]  Clinton was on the airplane and Bill was going to Lolita Express and going to the
[1:04:43.160 --> 1:04:45.920]  island those were put out years ago proven to be fake turn out they were
[1:04:45.920 --> 1:04:50.520]  fraudulent that's being flooded the top of Twitter what else is being flooded
[1:04:50.520 --> 1:04:57.040]  at the top of Twitter that I sit crews downtown to burn a homeless camp they
[1:04:57.040 --> 1:05:00.960]  took a little clip of a homeless go everybody runs when his when his
[1:05:00.960 --> 1:05:04.320]  mattress is being burned our camera people don't run they didn't do it he

[1:05:23.440 --> 1:05:28.560]  RT and BBC and San Antonio news and Dallas news and I have family calling
[1:05:28.560 --> 1:05:32.880]  saying did you burn the homeless camp because you know people think okay the
[1:05:32.880 --> 1:05:38.520]  media doesn't lie like that you Alex Jones burned down a homeless camp we're
[1:05:38.520 --> 1:05:41.160]  gonna go to Allen keys for the balance the hour and get his breakdown as a
[1:05:41.160 --> 1:05:46.160]  former head US ambassador to the United Nations about this UN WHO new world
[1:05:46.160 --> 1:05:50.400]  order constellation attack on America and the fact that this is the modern
[1:05:50.400 --> 1:05:54.600]  war and everything it's unfolding but before we do that let me just give you
[1:05:54.600 --> 1:06:00.040]  a snippet of what we're dealing with right now this this is the type of stuff
[1:06:00.040 --> 1:06:03.320]  that's all over Twitter being boosted at the top of Twitter that Trump's raping
[1:06:03.320 --> 1:06:07.680]  little girls with no proof that I'm burning down homeless camps this is a
[1:06:07.680 --> 1:06:13.200]  congressional candidate responds to mattress burning Richard row and this
[1:06:13.200 --> 1:06:17.240]  is the type of stuff that that's being boosted by time I wasn't even down there
[1:06:17.240 --> 1:06:21.160]  my crew was there we were covering it we would never commit a crime we don't do
[1:06:21.160 --> 1:06:25.960]  it doesn't matter they don't care they just say because we broke Antifa burning
[1:06:25.960 --> 1:06:30.800]  the homeless camp and and Twitter had their people put out that I did it that
[1:06:30.800 --> 1:06:34.640]  this this is the type of guy very scary guy looks like he's had a lobotomy and
[1:06:34.640 --> 1:06:37.800]  I'm not being mean about it I mean you're very scary individual this is the
[1:06:37.800 --> 1:06:41.880]  type of mentally unhinged people that I believe that I'm burning homeless camps
[1:06:41.880 --> 1:06:49.400]  here it is hello Richard row candidate for Congress Florida's House 23 news out of Austin, Texas info wars
[1:06:49.400 --> 1:06:57.120]  apparently filmed themselves setting a homeless man's mattress on fire to frame
[1:06:57.120 --> 1:07:06.640]  Antifa protesters in order to get footage for their video website toward the end of
[1:07:06.640 --> 1:07:13.680]  said footage the homeless man came up screaming begging asking why info wars
[1:07:13.680 --> 1:07:18.120]  is of course saying it was Antifa
[1:07:20.160 --> 1:07:26.600]  no one believes you you piece of no one believes you not just because I was
[1:07:26.600 --> 1:07:29.520]  Sandy Hook and all the other disinformation you spread not just
[1:07:29.520 --> 1:07:32.360]  because you're a disinformation outlet with Russian ties who just spreads
[1:07:32.360 --> 1:07:37.040]  Russian Trump propaganda it's because we know how you kind of institutions work
[1:07:37.040 --> 1:07:40.280]  I know I know info war very personally because I've ran into many rallies I
[1:07:40.280 --> 1:07:44.320]  know exactly what they do they start that they create fake news and then they
[1:07:44.320 --> 1:07:47.560]  call everything fails fake news because that's what we're all Orwellian fascists
[1:07:47.560 --> 1:07:51.600]  do they do whatever they accuse the other side of doing in this case false flag
[1:07:51.600 --> 1:07:55.920]  they create false flags they do whatever they say the other guy was doing look the
[1:07:55.920 --> 1:07:59.040]  guy's face is on camera it's on camera you're gonna say it wasn't it wasn't when
[1:07:59.040 --> 1:08:03.000]  you okay he's on camera then take it to the cops and when they tie him to you I
[1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:07.280]  hope they string every one of you up oh why is he screaming at you Alex why is
[1:08:07.280 --> 1:08:11.560]  he screaming at your video crew please stop please stop why is he saying that
[1:08:11.560 --> 1:08:14.960]  to your video crew Alex maybe because it was you were the ones doing it huh oh
[1:08:14.960 --> 1:08:18.480]  and why did the director suddenly out cut cut cut the minute he started
[1:08:18.480 --> 1:08:21.280]  screaming oh that would be a perfect opportunity to frame the lives that'd be
[1:08:21.280 --> 1:08:24.200]  a perfect opportunity except that guy knew it wasn't them he knew it was you
[1:08:24.200 --> 1:08:29.160]  that's why you yelled cut cut cut because you got caught everyone knows you
[1:08:29.160 --> 1:08:32.320]  got caught and I hope when they catch you when they when they when that judge

[1:08:35.240 --> 1:08:39.880]  string every one of you up with arson criminal mischief I hope they crucify
[1:08:39.880 --> 1:08:44.400]  you and drag you out of court with your head on a pike Richard wrote for
[1:08:44.400 --> 1:08:49.880]  Congress I'm out so that's a little sampling of what's going on no one says
[1:08:49.880 --> 1:08:54.080]  cut Twitter only lets us put out short videos are our crew that has little
[1:08:54.080 --> 1:08:57.760]  accounts that are getting banned all the time and we released the raw footage
[1:08:57.760 --> 1:09:01.240]  and this guy by the way we sent him and tweeted him the stuff he won't stop
[1:09:01.240 --> 1:09:05.560]  because it doesn't matter to him whatever he says we have the video people
[1:09:05.560 --> 1:09:08.760]  running in burning it then they go oh well the people are wearing him for worse
[1:09:08.760 --> 1:09:15.880]  gear then you look they're not wearing him for his year it's a spurs hat so
[1:09:15.880 --> 1:09:20.680]  again ladies and gentlemen this is how the left spins everything we show people
[1:09:20.680 --> 1:09:25.320]  burning a homeless camp and I did it and this is what they're doing and now they
[1:09:25.320 --> 1:09:29.840]  say here it is right here exclusive troubled woman with a history of drug
[1:09:29.840 --> 1:09:33.800]  use who claimed that she is assaulted by Trump at Jeffrey Epstein sex party
[1:09:33.800 --> 1:09:43.120]  day 13 made it all up she now admits but this is all being recycled folks and
[1:09:43.120 --> 1:09:47.000]  being pushed they're making their revolutionary move right now we're seeing
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:52.400]  more globalist propaganda and activity in an hour nice to see in five years so
[1:09:52.400 --> 1:09:56.080]  Alan Key's former US ambassador United Nations under Ronald Reagan best-selling
[1:09:56.080 --> 1:09:58.920]  author talk show host former host of crossfire and so many other great
[1:09:58.920 --> 1:10:02.960]  programs deep six in the memory holds he's so effective and truthful joins us
[1:10:02.960 --> 1:10:06.120]  and I really appreciate him coming on but what would you call this point in
[1:10:06.120 --> 1:10:10.440]  time ambassador that we're in right now I want listeners understand I've been on
[1:10:10.440 --> 1:10:14.400]  there 26 years we've never entered anything like this in my view what would
[1:10:14.400 --> 1:10:18.360]  you call this period well I think it's the period in which we're going to
[1:10:18.360 --> 1:10:23.400]  decide whether or not our constitutional self-government survives or is
[1:10:23.400 --> 1:10:29.280]  overthrown by a little clique of ideologues who are seeking to subject the
[1:10:29.280 --> 1:10:35.360]  people of the United States and indeed the world to their ideological camp so
[1:10:35.360 --> 1:10:39.600]  that at the end of the day everything that we have stood for and helped other
[1:10:39.600 --> 1:10:44.600]  nations to arrive at will be destroyed and we'll see the world subjected to a
[1:10:44.600 --> 1:10:50.760]  totalitarian communist style tyranny their model seems to be communist China
[1:10:50.760 --> 1:10:56.360]  these days but but we should believe I guess from what you're saying that only
[1:10:56.360 --> 1:11:00.680]  the Russians are involved since they have actually at least by their
[1:11:00.680 --> 1:11:05.400]  appearances gotten rid of communism therefore they must be to blame not the
[1:11:05.400 --> 1:11:11.240]  folks who are actually practicing that regimes excesses now and you just hit
[1:11:11.240 --> 1:11:15.600]  the total key where we are the total key the American system not we ever
[1:11:15.600 --> 1:11:19.680]  realize it but our ideal of humanity and empowerment all this they the
[1:11:19.680 --> 1:11:22.120]  globalist can't compete their authoritarian that's what they want to
[1:11:22.120 --> 1:11:26.840]  say freedom is slavery so that we give up on it so they can just have free reign
[1:11:26.840 --> 1:11:31.120]  because the American system threatens their hegemonic rule well I think
[1:11:31.120 --> 1:11:34.080]  there's no doubt about that and we're also we have also been the most
[1:11:34.080 --> 1:11:38.680]  successful country in the history of the world because we tapped into the
[1:11:38.680 --> 1:11:43.920]  remarkable energy that comes with a people that are both free to make
[1:11:43.920 --> 1:11:48.000]  choices and decisions and take responsibility but also disciplined by a
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  sense of right and that's what our commitment to God endowed rights is
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:57.200]  really about it's about accepting the discipline that there's a standard of
[1:11:57.200 --> 1:12:01.920]  right and wrong and together we stand on the common ground of agreeing that when
[1:12:01.920 --> 1:12:06.240]  you do what's right it is the job of the community and the government it
[1:12:06.240 --> 1:12:12.320]  establishes to make sure that you are secure in your exercise of right and I
[1:12:12.320 --> 1:12:17.680]  think that that combination of the moral standard ultimately appealing to God and
[1:12:17.680 --> 1:12:23.360]  the commitment to respect individual rights and responsibilities it has
[1:12:23.360 --> 1:12:27.480]  unleashed a great success in this country you're right that's the secret formula
[1:12:27.480 --> 1:12:30.680]  and the Satanist can't handle it so when we come back with former ambassador
[1:12:30.680 --> 1:12:33.760]  United Nations Alan Keyes the smartest guys on the planet who didn't serve
[1:12:33.760 --> 1:12:38.480]  evil what comes next how do we stop this martial law how do we stop the race
[1:12:38.480 --> 1:12:42.720]  riots how do we go after the Democrats that are openly triggering it and then
[1:12:42.720 --> 1:12:46.640]  claiming Russians are behind it they're all over the place pushing it all the
[1:12:46.640 --> 1:12:50.920]  big corporations wanted and then the Russians are doing it it took hundreds
[1:12:50.920 --> 1:12:54.240]  and hundreds of years of human civilization to build up the world
[1:12:54.240 --> 1:13:00.040]  economy to where it is every economist is on record saying that as this
[1:13:00.040 --> 1:13:03.720]  economy has been shut down for two months it is going to be a death sentence
[1:13:03.720 --> 1:13:07.800]  to the third world and a horrible nightmarish collapse for the first
[1:13:07.800 --> 1:13:11.600]  world and that the general public is going to go into deep deep debt to the
[1:13:11.600 --> 1:13:17.680]  mega banks but I'm gonna have medical ID cards or synoculations we are now in a
[1:13:17.680 --> 1:13:23.120]  giant dystopia but a lot of people are waking up and there is a major back
[1:13:23.120 --> 1:13:28.200]  lash taking place against this tyranny and we must all rediscover our bill of
[1:13:28.200 --> 1:13:32.960]  rights rediscover our constitution and our backbone and start saying no to
[1:13:32.960 --> 1:13:37.080]  people who take this moral high ground and say shut your business down shut
[1:13:37.080 --> 1:13:41.720]  your life down it'll save lives no it's caused millions to already starve to death
[1:13:41.720 --> 1:13:45.360]  tens of millions more so the cowards who went along with us with your virtues
[1:13:45.360 --> 1:13:51.080]  signaling you have destroyed your lives and our lives congratulations the panic
[1:13:51.080 --> 1:13:55.080]  that has been orchestrated by the global corporates media and the chai comms
[1:13:55.080 --> 1:14:00.760]  is going to now trigger a worldwide depression in fact we're already into
[1:14:00.760 --> 1:14:04.440]  the worldwide depression and the death sentence for the third world but it's
[1:14:04.440 --> 1:14:09.520]  critical to understand that the longer the shutdown persists the worse it's
[1:14:09.520 --> 1:14:14.760]  going to be a month of shutdown will destroy decades of wealth that's been
[1:14:14.760 --> 1:14:18.280]  built up in a complex economy that's why we've always said it's important to be a
[1:14:18.280 --> 1:14:21.800]  prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient because the globalists
[1:14:21.800 --> 1:14:26.240]  want to make us all dependent so that we're under their control they've
[1:14:26.240 --> 1:14:32.000]  admitted all of this so remember how does info wars continue years and decades
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:36.440]  in many cases to be able to predict things before they happen because we're
[1:14:36.440 --> 1:14:40.320]  following the globalist blueprint and their battle plan and yes it's
[1:14:40.320 --> 1:14:44.680]  dystopic and yes it's scary but denying it and letting them carry it out is a
[1:14:44.680 --> 1:14:48.840]  thousand times more scary it's time to stop the denial and realize what's
[1:14:48.840 --> 1:14:57.640]  really happening you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:15:07.320 --> 1:15:10.760]  all right Ellen T former ambassador United Nations our guest I'm your host
[1:15:10.760 --> 1:15:16.800]  Alex Jones and I was just in the break room right there getting a cup of coffee
[1:15:16.800 --> 1:15:27.280]  and I was watching senator Ted Cruz talk about how Antifa is terrorist funded
[1:15:27.280 --> 1:15:30.640]  working with foreign governments to overthrow the US and how they don't
[1:15:30.640 --> 1:15:34.200]  have US citizens rights and how we're in a fight for our lives and it wasn't
[1:15:34.200 --> 1:15:37.600]  rhetoric because we've been saying that it's the truth but I'm just sitting there
[1:15:37.600 --> 1:15:42.640]  watching this we've had so much normalcy and so much freedom and for so long that
[1:15:42.640 --> 1:15:48.160]  that people don't get how much danger we're all in and that these big mega
[1:15:48.160 --> 1:15:52.680]  corporations are very arrogant and they've not had due process as bad as
[1:15:52.680 --> 1:15:55.640]  our government's been it's had corrupt problems these are bigger than
[1:15:55.640 --> 1:15:59.160]  governments now and and they're and they're they're they're very autocratic
[1:15:59.160 --> 1:16:04.880]  and they're very evil and so folks need to understand I'm a libertarian in that
[1:16:04.880 --> 1:16:07.320]  I want a very small government but I want a government that protects my
[1:16:07.320 --> 1:16:09.840]  liberty because there's always another government trying to come in and take
[1:16:09.840 --> 1:16:13.680]  over and and so this is the greatest threat we face in our whole history and
[1:16:13.680 --> 1:16:16.160]  it's not just about America I don't Allen keys and everybody I get on their
[1:16:16.160 --> 1:16:18.680]  great patriots are always like America America and I get that but
[1:16:18.680 --> 1:16:22.720]  everybody's been around the world this is about true evil on a planetary scale
[1:16:22.720 --> 1:16:26.800]  corporations that have gotten away with whatever they want who now think they're
[1:16:26.800 --> 1:16:30.480]  God and to have Apple that owns these slave factories with the worst abuses on
[1:16:30.480 --> 1:16:34.400]  record they make Nike look like humanitarians lecturing everybody and
[1:16:34.400 --> 1:16:38.520]  saying kill the police now and hijacking everyone's browser they're getting you
[1:16:38.520 --> 1:16:42.400]  used to being raped that just oh my private message has been intercepted oh
[1:16:42.400 --> 1:16:48.960]  my my app now has a message for me this is a takeover so Allen keys you can be
[1:16:48.960 --> 1:16:53.520]  you're dead right that they're trying to destroy the American system I just have
[1:16:53.520 --> 1:16:57.920]  been so alarmist so long knowing this was coming how now at the actual point of
[1:16:57.920 --> 1:17:02.760]  war do we telegraph the people that you better hit the knee and ask Jesus to open
[1:17:02.760 --> 1:17:07.000]  that channel up like you were saying and then take action because you know God's
[1:17:07.000 --> 1:17:12.480]  there but God helps those that help themselves how do we quantify for people
[1:17:12.480 --> 1:17:15.880]  that this is game time right now this isn't this isn't little league bush
[1:17:15.880 --> 1:17:19.360]  league this isn't the playoffs it's the Super Bowl for the whole future of
[1:17:19.360 --> 1:17:23.960]  humanity I think the first thing we have to do is make sure that the people who
[1:17:23.960 --> 1:17:29.560]  are representing us are doing their jobs and I have been watching a lot of these
[1:17:29.560 --> 1:17:34.040]  people talk about the violence that's occurring and they act as if this is some
[1:17:34.040 --> 1:17:39.320]  protect protest that's protected by the Constitution I it amazes me that people
[1:17:39.320 --> 1:17:43.280]  never go back to the Constitution and read it because the right that's not
[1:17:43.280 --> 1:17:47.360]  beating people up and right thanks the rights that that's protected in the
[1:17:47.360 --> 1:17:53.800]  Constitution is a right that says Congress shall make no law abridging the
[1:17:53.800 --> 1:18:00.360]  right of the people peace of belief to assemble peace of belief so if people are
[1:18:00.360 --> 1:18:04.760]  out there and they're burning down police precincts and destroying malls and
[1:18:04.760 --> 1:18:09.720]  and assaulting people and so forth and so on they are not protected by the
[1:18:09.720 --> 1:18:14.640]  Constitution of the United States what they are actually doing qualifies as
[1:18:14.640 --> 1:18:20.360]  insurrection and when insurrection becomes widespread which it has been
[1:18:20.360 --> 1:18:27.080]  lately I think we need to remember that the president is the commander-in-chief
[1:18:27.080 --> 1:18:31.560]  what's he the commander-in-chief of Alan he's the commander-in-chief of the Army
[1:18:31.560 --> 1:18:37.200]  and Navy people know that but he's also the commander-in-chief of the militia of
[1:18:37.200 --> 1:18:43.960]  the several states when called into the actual service of the United States and
[1:18:43.960 --> 1:18:47.280]  people have been talking as if the only people who can mobilize the militia are
[1:18:47.280 --> 1:18:50.560]  the governors and the president must ask their permission to mobilize them and
[1:18:50.560 --> 1:18:56.600]  so forth and so on not true okay because at the end of the day it is also
[1:18:56.600 --> 1:19:01.880]  stated in the US code that the president can under certain circumstances
[1:19:01.880 --> 1:19:08.760]  when the states have failed to act in order to secure that protection required
[1:19:08.760 --> 1:19:13.520]  by the 14th Amendment incumbent upon them and stated in the Constitution that
[1:19:13.520 --> 1:19:18.200]  no person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process
[1:19:18.200 --> 1:19:21.840]  so he's following the Constitution a hundred percent in his statement yesterday
[1:19:21.840 --> 1:19:26.680]  well when he says the governor's won't act I will well when you go out and burn
[1:19:26.680 --> 1:19:30.160]  down malls and so forth and so on and the police are standing around acting
[1:19:30.160 --> 1:19:33.800]  like they're doing nothing because the governor says so or you mobilize the
[1:19:33.800 --> 1:19:37.160]  National Guard and then act as if you want to have a big prayer meeting rather
[1:19:37.160 --> 1:19:42.480]  than stop the violence and it continues night after night and so forth and so on
[1:19:42.480 --> 1:19:46.280]  and it gets worse the president is supposed to look at that and make a
[1:19:46.280 --> 1:19:52.160]  determination they have failed to deal with the insurrection the law then
[1:19:52.160 --> 1:19:58.400]  says that he shall then turn to the and it's not just the military and this is
[1:19:58.400 --> 1:20:02.280]  what's been bothering me a little bit about the response the first thing the
[1:20:02.280 --> 1:20:08.000]  president has to do he has is he has to assert his role as commander-in-chief of
[1:20:08.000 --> 1:20:14.160]  the military yes but of the militia when called into the service so he has to
[1:20:14.160 --> 1:20:18.960]  call them into his service he has that has to has to basically say you guys
[1:20:18.960 --> 1:20:23.080]  aren't doing this job I'm taking over the National Guard by the way was
[1:20:23.080 --> 1:20:27.960]  given up and citizens had to go protect that's what you're saying is is it we
[1:20:27.960 --> 1:20:31.520]  as citizens constitute government to carry out our operations but we
[1:20:31.520 --> 1:20:36.040]  inherently still have that right in fact no I'm sorry that's not what I'm saying
[1:20:36.040 --> 1:20:40.440]  let's be clear about this you're saying the president has to be in command let
[1:20:40.440 --> 1:20:45.160]  me finish the president is the commander-in-chief his word now should be
[1:20:45.160 --> 1:20:49.720]  governing every response throughout the 20 or so states and the more than a
[1:20:49.720 --> 1:20:54.080]  hundred cities that have been under attack he then needs to be the head of
[1:20:54.080 --> 1:20:58.840]  the chain of command deciding what's to be done by the National Guard by the
[1:20:58.840 --> 1:21:04.520]  militia by the way the word militia is not used in some sense of that is not
[1:21:04.520 --> 1:21:11.960]  constitutional it's a it's supposed to be those between 17 and 45 who can then
[1:21:11.960 --> 1:21:16.920]  be called into action under regulations that the president is going to
[1:21:16.920 --> 1:21:23.480]  determine to help restore order to help take up tasks that might be needed to
[1:21:23.480 --> 1:21:27.720]  support the forces in the National Guard maybe eventually in the military who do
[1:21:27.720 --> 1:21:31.400]  so but the first task of the president is to make sure that everybody
[1:21:31.400 --> 1:21:35.120]  understands there's a single chain of command because if he brings the
[1:21:35.120 --> 1:21:39.000]  military in and people are pretending that the National Guard answers to the
[1:21:39.000 --> 1:21:42.560]  governor's that's going to lead to confusion so he has to do it in the
[1:21:42.560 --> 1:21:47.040]  right ordering and I mean I get what you're saying I'm bringing up the
[1:21:47.040 --> 1:21:51.720]  citizens are filling the gap that Trump hasn't yet gone into going out and
[1:21:51.720 --> 1:21:54.960]  defending you know the the the country but I get what you're saying is the
[1:21:54.960 --> 1:21:58.040]  president has to declare himself as the commander-in-chief under the
[1:21:58.040 --> 1:22:01.760]  Constitution which he's already begun to do yesterday and sweep the governor's
[1:22:01.760 --> 1:22:07.240]  aside that want a virtue signal well he sweeps them aside on a lawful basis
[1:22:07.240 --> 1:22:12.200]  because they have failed to deal with the situation and having failed to deal
[1:22:12.200 --> 1:22:15.680]  with the situation he steps forward to deal with it and he takes over and he
[1:22:15.680 --> 1:22:20.240]  says the National Guard is called into service under the United States to make
[1:22:20.240 --> 1:22:25.720]  sure that no person will be deprived of liberty without life liberty or
[1:22:25.720 --> 1:22:29.760]  property without due process which has been occurring that's the specific
[1:22:29.760 --> 1:22:33.720]  requirement in the US code and he can now evoke it because they have failed
[1:22:33.720 --> 1:22:39.200]  sometimes by willful failure not acting sometimes they've tried but they haven't
[1:22:39.200 --> 1:22:44.480]  succeeded it doesn't matter he can take responsibility and if he then feels that
[1:22:44.480 --> 1:22:49.800]  they must be supplemented in one way or another by military forces the the
[1:22:49.800 --> 1:22:55.480]  actual authorization in the US code says that he can mobilize the army the Navy
[1:22:55.480 --> 1:23:02.480]  the militia or any other means necessary to deal with the violation of the
[1:23:02.480 --> 1:23:06.480]  Constitution there's no doubt though this is the global assault Americans need
[1:23:06.480 --> 1:23:10.280]  to know Trump didn't start this we didn't start this this is the attempt to
[1:23:10.280 --> 1:23:13.600]  overthrow the country we'll come back and talk about I know you get into
[1:23:13.600 --> 1:23:16.600]  technical stuff and that's great but where you see this going if Trump doesn't
[1:23:16.600 --> 1:23:19.400]  act and how he acts and how they obviously want to get some people killed
[1:23:19.400 --> 1:23:24.000]  with the military then create a bigger race war it's just so disgusting how
[1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:28.280]  about cutting the head off the stage going after the anti for organizers the
[1:23:28.280 --> 1:23:33.080]  terrorist funders the Soros people and that's the most logical thing the FBI
[1:23:33.080 --> 1:23:39.720]  raids five people they'll stop it's a few people Obama Hillary the globalist
[1:23:39.720 --> 1:23:44.320]  they're running this so instead of just having a huge martial law war why not
[1:23:44.320 --> 1:23:51.720]  just send in the FBI to arrest these people we're living an insanely dangerous
[1:23:51.720 --> 1:23:55.480]  times and I've told folks going back three months ago I'm not buying
[1:23:55.480 --> 1:23:58.840]  storeable food because I'm worried about the COVID-19 virus I'm worried about the
[1:23:58.840 --> 1:24:02.720]  food shortages and the economic collapse and now you've submitted that a chain
[1:24:02.720 --> 1:24:06.320]  reaction has begun that's already caused food shortages and the collapse of
[1:24:06.320 --> 1:24:09.640]  farms and ranches across the United States and it's even worse in the third
[1:24:09.640 --> 1:24:12.920]  world so I hope Trump with his initiatives to clean this up and fix it
[1:24:12.920 --> 1:24:17.240]  but with the election fraud and the COVID-19 all the wars and the third
[1:24:17.240 --> 1:24:20.720]  world collapsing and everything else is going on now is the time to get
[1:24:20.720 --> 1:24:25.240]  storeable foods because they'll last for 25 years they're in easily totable bags
[1:24:25.240 --> 1:24:29.200]  it's high quality food and it's good to have that box checked off to be ready and

[1:24:59.760 --> 1:25:03.600]  when I grew up in Omaha Nebraska one time there was an argument in the street

[1:25:07.920 --> 1:25:12.160]  head had blood pouring out a huge hole he was holding it he walked around
[1:25:12.160 --> 1:25:17.400]  gibbering talking nonsense for about 60 seconds and then just fell over dead well

[1:27:42.920 --> 1:27:47.360]  whatever it means I was telling you what's going on but getting serious
[1:27:47.360 --> 1:27:51.240]  Alan Key's the smart guy and you can hear the impetus in his voice when he was
[1:27:51.240 --> 1:27:54.440]  like that's not what I'm saying I'm saying this it wasn't about him slapping
[1:27:54.440 --> 1:27:58.360]  me down he's saying no my point is this Trump must be the commander-in-chief he
[1:27:58.360 --> 1:28:02.200]  must stand up at this moment that's what Tucker Carlson I know well even with
[1:28:02.200 --> 1:28:07.840]  that he's just desperate to get Trump to just do the right thing and stop listening
[1:28:07.840 --> 1:28:12.000]  to Jared Kushner and he came out against him last night the full videos on
[1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:16.880]  info wars.com Kushner's bad news folks and Carlson's been in the meetings he's
[1:28:16.880 --> 1:28:22.840]  been around and he's seen it for himself I was leaving that and this this time
[1:28:22.840 --> 1:28:25.320]  he's gonna bring the best out of people is gonna bring the worst out of people
[1:28:25.320 --> 1:28:29.800]  because I mean this is this is do or die this is game time folks I cannot tell
[1:28:29.800 --> 1:28:34.240]  you what it's gonna be like if this country goes into a full physical
[1:28:34.240 --> 1:28:38.440]  civil war and how stupid that's gonna be and how bad it's gonna be we'll talk
[1:28:38.440 --> 1:28:42.440]  to Alan Key's in a moment then we have Millie Weaver and Paul Watson joining us
[1:28:42.440 --> 1:28:45.400]  I'll just say this
[1:28:47.320 --> 1:28:51.640]  we're only here because of you in fact their attacks as Nietzsche said that
[1:28:51.640 --> 1:28:55.680]  which doesn't kill you makes you stronger they they took all their sponsors
[1:28:55.680 --> 1:29:00.360]  ten years ago so I went out and re-engineered the products to sell them and
[1:29:00.360 --> 1:29:03.360]  then you responded and then they try to take our PayPal and our accounts away
[1:29:03.360 --> 1:29:07.320]  but you supported us but I'm not a victim I'm an overcomer I'm a target but

[1:30:25.640 --> 1:30:29.520]  ambassador the United Nations author and talk show host Allen keys about start
[1:30:29.520 --> 1:30:33.080]  over then your message to the president of his office and what he needs to do
[1:30:33.080 --> 1:30:37.600]  now in the Constitution with what we're facing and then you live to focus on the
[1:30:37.600 --> 1:30:41.880]  positive I want you to answer this though what do you see happening if
[1:30:41.880 --> 1:30:45.880]  Trump doesn't take action correctly because I get it I'm trying to talk about
[1:30:45.880 --> 1:30:49.400]  the general audience give the audience info you're mainly a message to the
[1:30:49.400 --> 1:30:53.560]  president and I get that so what are you saying well what I'm saying is that he
[1:30:53.560 --> 1:30:57.520]  first of all has to stop the violence and that there is no excuse for that
[1:30:57.520 --> 1:31:02.800]  violence no constitutional protection for it it must simply stop and if there
[1:31:02.800 --> 1:31:06.760]  are governors and mayors who are dithering around the president has the
[1:31:06.760 --> 1:31:11.200]  constitutional authority and responsibility to step in and make sure
[1:31:11.200 --> 1:31:15.760]  that no person is deprived of life liberty or property absent due process
[1:31:15.760 --> 1:31:19.520]  which is the requirement of the Constitution imposed upon the states
[1:31:19.520 --> 1:31:24.160]  which he then is authorized to intervene take over the National Guard and
[1:31:24.160 --> 1:31:29.040]  whatever other means are necessary to restore order and that's what he must
[1:31:29.040 --> 1:31:33.080]  get about doing right away it's his responsibility to do that on behalf of
[1:31:33.080 --> 1:31:37.600]  the nation as a whole especially when things go beyond the scale of one state
[1:31:37.600 --> 1:31:42.320]  one city and you're dealing with what is now quite obviously an orchestrated
[1:31:42.320 --> 1:31:48.600]  attack on order throughout the society on the excuse by the way of an episode
[1:31:48.600 --> 1:31:53.480]  that was dealt with I think as expeditiously as you could have imagined
[1:31:53.480 --> 1:31:57.680]  faster than I've ever seen it in fact because the minute the autopsy had
[1:31:57.680 --> 1:32:02.560]  established the cause of death they had already fired the police officer then
[1:32:02.560 --> 1:32:06.520]  arrested him and are moving now to see whether others who stood by and did
[1:32:06.520 --> 1:32:11.760]  nothing would also be prosecuted you can't really observe due process without
[1:32:11.760 --> 1:32:16.440]  waiting for the autopsy report that's all they did they waited for that report
[1:32:16.440 --> 1:32:19.960]  and then they moved ahead they didn't go through the usual procedure which is a
[1:32:19.960 --> 1:32:24.120]  police an internal police investigation and all of that and I thought that that
[1:32:24.120 --> 1:32:29.200]  expedition was in response to the strong public outrage that I am pretty much
[1:32:29.200 --> 1:32:33.640]  everybody else who saw the episode was sharing I did not understand and neither
[1:32:33.640 --> 1:32:38.480]  did a lot of other people why something was not done in response to that
[1:32:38.480 --> 1:32:44.960]  situation way before this man was even in danger of death especially since he
[1:32:44.960 --> 1:32:50.040]  wasn't apparently suspected of a violent crime but once you get the message
[1:32:50.040 --> 1:32:55.240]  that this is something being used by others to attack the country the
[1:32:55.240 --> 1:32:59.600]  president must thus then respond and if the governors and mayors are not
[1:32:59.600 --> 1:33:04.360]  acting with expedition to deal with the violence if they're talking as some of
[1:33:04.360 --> 1:33:08.400]  them have as if there is some constitutional protection for that
[1:33:08.400 --> 1:33:12.800]  kind of violence then he has to intervene and set them straight and do so by
[1:33:12.800 --> 1:33:17.880]  means that establish the order of priorities he gets to take over the
[1:33:17.880 --> 1:33:22.280]  process of law enforcement and make sure that the Constitution is respected
[1:33:22.280 --> 1:33:30.320]  and he needs to do that now immediately I think that it it has been to me kind
[1:33:30.320 --> 1:33:34.080]  of dismaying that he hasn't moved I'm wondering whether his advisors haven't
[1:33:34.080 --> 1:33:39.120]  been going through the code in order to make it clear that he not only has where
[1:33:39.120 --> 1:33:45.280]  you have the authority the operative word is shell when this kind of an abuse
[1:33:45.280 --> 1:33:51.480]  of our rights is taking place then the president shall intervene if it appears
[1:33:51.480 --> 1:33:55.280]  that the governors and others have failed and I think the continuing violence
[1:33:55.280 --> 1:33:59.400]  certainly suggests that they have no you're right and that's it's Kushner
[1:33:59.400 --> 1:34:02.920]  that's telling Trump to do nothing which is insane well I think it's not
[1:34:02.920 --> 1:34:08.720]  anything it's it's going to be I think deeply harmful to the country and that
[1:34:08.720 --> 1:34:13.760]  is crazy the president cannot allow that to happen second the part that I think
[1:34:13.760 --> 1:34:18.760]  is important is that he can look at the means available and and decide which
[1:34:18.760 --> 1:34:22.000]  ones and I think it would be appropriate by the way for him to bring in the
[1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:28.280]  sheriffs for him to use the sheriffs to call out the able-bodied people 17 to
[1:34:28.280 --> 1:34:33.480]  45 within a certain criteria that could be useful to helping to guard buildings
[1:34:33.480 --> 1:34:38.040]  and restore order in that sense as a supplement to the National Guard I think
[1:34:38.040 --> 1:34:41.920]  we also have to be careful to keep in mind that you bring in military forces
[1:34:41.920 --> 1:34:46.880]  at a present time like this we are also in danger of other kinds of attacks and I
[1:34:46.880 --> 1:34:50.080]  hope they're taking account of that because some people in this country in
[1:34:50.080 --> 1:34:55.360]  our media have clearly been working in concert with China and other let's talk
[1:34:55.360 --> 1:34:58.760]  about that next segment in order to undermine our country I agree this is all
[1:34:58.760 --> 1:35:01.960]  admitted to be far and orchestrated now and that's the real way to cut the head
[1:35:01.960 --> 1:35:05.360]  off the snake I want to talk about that but here's the Polk County sheriff in
[1:35:05.360 --> 1:35:09.960]  Florida talking about the power of the militia here it is we have received
[1:35:09.960 --> 1:35:16.160]  information and social media that some of the criminals were going to take their
[1:35:16.160 --> 1:35:21.160]  criminal conduct into the neighborhoods I would tell them if you value your life
[1:35:21.160 --> 1:35:26.240]  you probably shouldn't do that in Polk County because the people of Polk County
[1:35:26.240 --> 1:35:33.880]  like guns they have guns I encourage them to own guns and they're going to be in
[1:35:33.880 --> 1:35:38.920]  their homes tonight with their guns loaded and if you try to break into their
[1:35:38.920 --> 1:35:46.120]  homes to steal to set fires I'm highly recommending they blow you back out of
[1:35:46.120 --> 1:35:54.040]  the house with their guns so leave the community alone and we'll do our best to
[1:35:54.040 --> 1:36:00.040]  support the community but ladies and gentlemen make no mistake about it all
[1:36:00.040 --> 1:36:05.760]  of that ugliness has taken away from what we're united about we're united
[1:36:05.760 --> 1:36:12.520]  about the conduct that you saw with George where he is life was taken with
[1:36:12.520 --> 1:36:16.960]  the need of the net is horrific and there's not enough words to explain
[1:36:16.960 --> 1:36:22.560]  that let's keep the focus on that that's right I mean nobody wants to watch
[1:36:22.560 --> 1:36:27.400]  somebody back for their life and die because of Minnesota is the only those
[1:36:27.400 --> 1:36:30.960]  cities the only two cities the country that allow that they banned that decades
[1:36:30.960 --> 1:36:35.400]  ago because it killed some people and so idiotic police training and now the
[1:36:35.400 --> 1:36:40.240]  whole country has to burn we have to have a domestic collapse but who's really
[1:36:40.240 --> 1:36:48.000]  behind it and how do we say no to that straight ahead I don't have to tell you
[1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:52.040]  that we are in the most important point in human history the globalists have
[1:36:52.040 --> 1:36:55.920]  taken the gloves off and they've taken the mask off and they're like yeah you're
[1:36:55.920 --> 1:37:00.520]  taking implantable chips yeah we're into pedophilia yeah we're into world
[1:37:00.520 --> 1:37:05.960]  government yeah you're obsolete you are non-essential we are shutting your
[1:37:05.960 --> 1:37:10.400]  ass down yeah we told you don't be farmers and don't be ranchers and don't
[1:37:10.400 --> 1:37:14.440]  work in industry anymore you're gonna be the service economy and now the
[1:37:14.440 --> 1:37:17.840]  globalists are telling you that there's no more service economy and you're
[1:37:17.840 --> 1:37:22.440]  obsolete so you better bow down to them and get your universal pittance income
[1:37:22.440 --> 1:37:27.400]  so they can dictate your life the handcuffs are going on right now we have
[1:37:27.400 --> 1:37:31.440]  to resist and say no to the new world order and that takes you understanding
[1:37:31.440 --> 1:37:35.400]  you were right and understanding I was right and getting in people's faces and
[1:37:35.400 --> 1:37:41.000]  raising the alarm now while you still can now is the time for action now is the

[1:39:07.560 --> 1:39:12.200]  the sudden they slow down they realize what's happened they fall over and they
[1:39:12.200 --> 1:39:17.320]  die then you go back them and haul them back in well that's what's gonna happen
[1:39:17.320 --> 1:39:23.200]  to the entire world now and that's what the economic numbers show is that we've
[1:39:23.200 --> 1:39:27.800]  been shot right in the heart and for the first world it's gonna mean a long
[1:39:27.800 --> 1:39:32.200]  horrible depression and a lot of death well the third world it's gonna mean
[1:39:32.200 --> 1:39:34.760]  probably over a hundred million dead according to you and I believe their
[1:39:34.760 --> 1:39:39.440]  numbers because it's the very UN that's orchestrated this to depopulate the
[1:39:39.440 --> 1:39:42.520]  third world so that all the leftists that thought it was their revolution to
[1:39:42.520 --> 1:39:45.560]  get rid of Trump you're a bunch of suckers and you bought into something
[1:39:45.560 --> 1:39:51.240]  better than what Hitler did as I record this announcement there's only one

[1:40:55.880 --> 1:41:07.040]  waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines
[1:41:07.040 --> 1:41:15.320]  of the info war so there's a viral video out right now it's on info wars.com
[1:41:15.320 --> 1:41:25.080]  of a pigeon battling with an escalator but that's the same thing we see there's
[1:41:25.080 --> 1:41:30.760]  a cardinal that for years came to my window and pecked it every morning he's
[1:41:30.760 --> 1:41:34.520]  gone now I kind of feel all left alone actually wanted to be died or whatever
[1:41:34.520 --> 1:41:37.520]  happened for a couple three or four years he pecked at the window and you know
[1:41:37.520 --> 1:41:42.520]  here you've got the pigeon running on the treadmill and you know attacking it
[1:41:42.520 --> 1:41:46.440]  and trying to control it and who knows it's 5g making it upset all the birds
[1:41:46.440 --> 1:41:50.680]  have been going crazy but this is this is racism this is fighting with each
[1:41:50.680 --> 1:41:55.000]  other over what color we are instead of our ideology we should be fighting with
[1:41:55.000 --> 1:41:58.600]  each other over what we stand for that should determine us what we believe what
[1:41:58.600 --> 1:42:03.640]  we build we do I've said this a thousand times I go to a restaurant because
[1:42:03.640 --> 1:42:07.720]  they've got good food because I like southern cooking and the north thrill
[1:42:07.720 --> 1:42:10.880]  racist about southern cooking they call it soul food if it's just other cooking
[1:42:10.880 --> 1:42:14.720]  like oh that's black people food I just go to the black soul food places they
[1:42:14.720 --> 1:42:17.560]  got the best chicken fried steaks and sweet potatoes and you know food like
[1:42:17.560 --> 1:42:20.720]  that to me I don't walk in there going oh these are black people I'm virtually
[1:42:20.720 --> 1:42:23.680]  signaling going in here to eat a black restaurant I'm going there because they
[1:42:23.680 --> 1:42:27.160]  got the best chicken fried steak and the best sweet potatoes and the best black
[1:42:27.160 --> 1:42:30.120]  eyed peas and the best cornbread and the best whatever because that's what I grew
[1:42:30.120 --> 1:42:35.200]  up eating to me that's not black food that's just Texas food but but again it
[1:42:35.200 --> 1:42:40.840]  shows on the left politicizes every issue and instead of it being food they
[1:42:40.840 --> 1:42:45.720]  turn it into a new symbol and that's what the psychologist and the and the
[1:42:45.720 --> 1:42:50.080]  people running things have done and now we have communist China openly funding
[1:42:50.080 --> 1:42:53.840]  insurrection openly allowed to do whatever they want on Twitter and Facebook but
[1:42:53.840 --> 1:42:57.760]  the president censored and you talk about a day late a dollar short look
[1:42:57.760 --> 1:43:03.480]  Trump only with 156 days left 153 now announces an executive order against
[1:43:03.480 --> 1:43:10.760]  big tech citizenship but Trump can't do it all I get that our guest is right
[1:43:10.760 --> 1:43:14.120]  saying Trump should take action he's in the prime position do it but what do we
[1:43:14.120 --> 1:43:20.120]  the people do to put pressure on everybody to realize the simple decision
[1:43:20.120 --> 1:43:24.200]  that bankrupting America having a race war locking everything down now the
[1:43:24.200 --> 1:43:29.920]  German Interior Ministry comes out and says COVID-19 so hoax I mean everything
[1:43:29.920 --> 1:43:33.560]  they do is a fraud so what I'm getting at here is we can push the president all
[1:43:33.560 --> 1:43:38.640]  day and that's good and that's important Alan keys but what else can we the
[1:43:38.640 --> 1:43:43.120]  people do to try to turn this around and not go down this road and what happens
[1:43:43.120 --> 1:43:50.080]  if we don't is that a question for me and that's a lot of questions I'm I mean
[1:43:50.080 --> 1:43:55.720]  there's so many points do we pressure Trump what do we do well I think the two
[1:43:55.720 --> 1:44:00.520]  things are actually never separable because at the end of the day we elect
[1:44:00.520 --> 1:44:05.920]  our officials to represent our responsibility to do certain things and
[1:44:05.920 --> 1:44:09.520]  the Second Amendment's a good example by the way though everybody forgets this
[1:44:09.520 --> 1:44:16.720]  the Second Amendment isn't just about the militia it's about a well regulated
[1:44:16.720 --> 1:44:21.400]  militia part of that regulation is taken care of by the Congress and the
[1:44:21.400 --> 1:44:26.120]  National Guard and all of that and everybody knows about that but when I
[1:44:26.120 --> 1:44:30.440]  say that the president has to move in and start dealing with the militia in
[1:44:30.440 --> 1:44:34.560]  that larger sense he then has the responsibility to say we're faced with
[1:44:34.560 --> 1:44:40.240]  this situation and here's what the folks starting at the grassroots can do to
[1:44:40.240 --> 1:44:45.280]  help restore order in this what you're saying is that infrastructure died it
[1:44:45.280 --> 1:44:49.920]  went away it became vestigial no it didn't die no I'm not saying that I'm not
[1:44:49.920 --> 1:44:53.280]  saying that let me say what I said your just we're arguing about the point but
[1:44:53.280 --> 1:44:58.440]  let me get the Constitution actually gives the president the leeway to adapt
[1:44:58.440 --> 1:45:02.800]  the unorganized the militia now let me just stop you I'm not trying to get an
[1:45:02.800 --> 1:45:06.040]  argument with you here what I'm saying is yeah they have killed the nerve
[1:45:06.040 --> 1:45:10.640]  endings I'm not saying the law is dead I'm saying they have extincted it you're
[1:45:10.640 --> 1:45:15.000]  saying when you say regulated it means there is a governmental bureaucracy of
[1:45:15.000 --> 1:45:18.600]  the people being civil defense that should be brought back and you're saying
[1:45:18.600 --> 1:45:21.600]  was never taken away but how do you activate something that's been put in
[1:45:21.600 --> 1:45:26.640]  in carbon-freeze well see I think bureaucracy at the moment doesn't
[1:45:26.640 --> 1:45:31.600]  enter into it what is enters into it is the president of the United States
[1:45:31.600 --> 1:45:37.360]  appealing to the able-bodied males seven to 45 in different parts of the
[1:45:37.360 --> 1:45:42.200]  country pointing for instance to the county sheriffs and saying here's a
[1:45:42.200 --> 1:45:47.160]  responsible official and I would can I finish I would like this responsible
[1:45:47.160 --> 1:45:53.360]  official to become a focal point for organizing the response of communities
[1:45:53.360 --> 1:45:58.720]  against the disc violence and I will will will give them some instructions
[1:45:58.720 --> 1:46:03.920]  about how they go about doing this so that in a regular fashion people can
[1:46:03.920 --> 1:46:08.320]  come together and organize in defense of their communities we need to restore
[1:46:08.320 --> 1:46:13.160]  that sense which was always part of this understanding that part of what needs
[1:46:13.160 --> 1:46:17.760]  to be done when there's a local insurrection or organized insurrection
[1:46:17.760 --> 1:46:21.920]  targeting the local agree with that I'm saying there's a few feet of that how
[1:46:21.920 --> 1:46:26.880]  does the president carry that out he must he must ask for it and he must give
[1:46:26.880 --> 1:46:30.840]  instructions as to how it is done and then he must allow the sheriffs who are
[1:46:30.840 --> 1:46:35.160]  quite familiar you saw that sheriff I think that sheriff has the right spirit
[1:46:35.160 --> 1:46:40.040]  has the knowledge probably of how it needs to be done or implemented at least
[1:46:40.040 --> 1:46:43.680]  what he needs is the direction and that direction would then come in these
[1:46:43.680 --> 1:46:48.560]  circumstances for these circumstances from the White House and he needs to task
[1:46:48.560 --> 1:46:54.120]  people around him in the military to come up with that organization so it can
[1:46:54.120 --> 1:46:58.240]  be implemented right now to deal with this is saying the president must call
[1:46:58.240 --> 1:47:02.520]  on the power of the people that I agree with that statement that's right but he
[1:47:02.520 --> 1:47:07.440]  must call on it in a way that helps to designate who's going to be responsible
[1:47:07.440 --> 1:47:13.000]  for organizing it and take responsibility for making sure that it is done in a way
[1:47:13.000 --> 1:47:17.440]  that's consistent with the mission which is to make sure that order which means
[1:47:17.440 --> 1:47:23.600]  respect for the simple fact that no violence is to be done and no threat is
[1:47:23.600 --> 1:47:28.560]  to be posed to life liberty or property without due process that's the mission
[1:47:28.560 --> 1:47:33.160]  and that's the mission that is not yet being acquitted by the governors and the
[1:47:33.160 --> 1:47:38.120]  mayors partly I suspect because some of them are so committed to this leftist
[1:47:38.120 --> 1:47:44.040]  ideology that they actually think that violence is a proper means for expressing
[1:47:44.040 --> 1:47:47.920]  our listen to this my son we haven't aired this yet he got the footage that
[1:47:47.920 --> 1:47:51.320]  two nights ago he went into a convenience store there's a guy attacking
[1:47:51.320 --> 1:47:55.480]  everyone and beating him and stealing when the cops come they let him go because
[1:47:55.480 --> 1:47:59.840]  the guy said I'm a protester so when you in law are explaining the media as you
[1:47:59.840 --> 1:48:04.120]  said it and Republican governors to not just Democrats are saying oh robbing and
[1:48:04.120 --> 1:48:08.360]  burning things is an act of protest no it's not no it's not that's something
[1:48:08.360 --> 1:48:12.720]  that I think needs to be gotten across quite quickly and but and introducing
[1:48:12.720 --> 1:48:18.040]  his role in this the president could actually in his statement make that
[1:48:18.040 --> 1:48:22.240]  part of the introduction this understanding that somehow protest is
[1:48:22.240 --> 1:48:28.120]  protected when it crosses the line into violence that's a wrong understanding
[1:48:28.120 --> 1:48:33.640]  my responsibility he should say is to make sure that the Constitution and law
[1:48:33.640 --> 1:48:39.120]  which requires that no person be deprived of life liberty or property and
[1:48:39.120 --> 1:48:43.200]  remember all the way back to the declaration all the way back Alex to the
[1:48:43.200 --> 1:48:47.800]  Declaration of Independence the primary role of the institution of government
[1:48:47.800 --> 1:48:55.200]  is to secure these rights among them the right to life liberty etc that that
[1:48:55.200 --> 1:49:00.160]  means that that security is a goal for government overall it's a goal
[1:49:00.160 --> 1:49:03.920]  recognized in the Constitution in specific terms life is the prime
[1:49:03.920 --> 1:49:10.720]  directive and yes and it has to be respected the Democrats the ideologues
[1:49:10.720 --> 1:49:14.400]  the leftist that's my question what are they I know you want to focus on us but
[1:49:14.400 --> 1:49:17.640]  they're really going for broke what do you expect them to do next this is very
[1:49:17.640 --> 1:49:22.160]  ominous they just seem to be going for broke well they seem very willing and
[1:49:22.160 --> 1:49:26.520]  anxious in fact to induce chaos and bring the country to civil war that's
[1:49:26.520 --> 1:49:33.400]  their goal the way you avoid civil war is by imposing civil order instead that is
[1:49:33.400 --> 1:49:39.000]  to say to take steps in line with the Constitution and the laws that restore
[1:49:39.000 --> 1:49:44.120]  order using and relying upon what's already been demonstrated some people
[1:49:44.120 --> 1:49:47.800]  hate it but I think what the American people demonstrated in the first part
[1:49:47.800 --> 1:49:51.560]  of this whole quarantine period was that when they're asked to do something
[1:49:51.560 --> 1:49:56.120]  that makes sense to them they do it even when it doesn't make sense to them
[1:49:56.120 --> 1:49:59.560]  they'll do it if they think it's going to be good for the country but when they
[1:49:59.560 --> 1:50:04.160]  see that they're being snookered they will start to resist but that's a
[1:50:04.160 --> 1:50:09.040]  combination of common sense and law abiding character that needs to be
[1:50:09.040 --> 1:50:14.280]  mobilized now by the president have faith in the grassroots have faith in your own
[1:50:14.280 --> 1:50:21.880]  powers don't listen to I agree Allen keys I am TV dot US I am TV dot US one

[1:50:41.680 --> 1:50:46.520]  and basket keys one of the smartest thank you thank you sir all right we've

[1:50:55.360 --> 1:51:01.160]  globalist operation and I just have hard to think the mass shooting there

[1:53:01.600 --> 1:53:06.560]  never caring about other people this delivered us into the hands of tyranny
[1:53:06.560 --> 1:53:11.160]  just like the history book show is just like the Bible states every time Israel
[1:53:11.160 --> 1:53:14.840]  became corrupt and evil and turned away from God they were brought into
[1:53:14.840 --> 1:53:19.840]  captivity because their people sold out to special interest and were
[1:53:19.840 --> 1:53:24.880]  infiltrated by spies and then they were enslaved we are repeating that again
[1:53:24.880 --> 1:53:30.640]  today compliance and going along with this system leads to absolute bondage
[1:53:30.640 --> 1:53:35.480]  info wars has decided to fight for freedom info wars that great victory

[1:54:06.960 --> 1:54:10.800]  segments Allen keys is amazing he's so optimistic if we would just follow the
[1:54:10.800 --> 1:54:15.520]  Constitution and Bill of Rights which are the weapons systems of freedom that
[1:54:15.520 --> 1:54:18.520]  he just wants to keep hammering those and gets pissed when I bring up the
[1:54:18.520 --> 1:54:25.840]  problems about okay I get all that but but but but what if we fail well let's
[1:54:25.840 --> 1:54:29.640]  not talk about the failure let's talk about the victory and I get that I'm
[1:54:29.640 --> 1:54:33.320]  not criticizing about that's why I love having him on he's so he's amazing he
[1:54:33.320 --> 1:54:37.200]  knows his stuff and that's why they buried him out there where you can't
[1:54:37.200 --> 1:54:45.240]  hear him except on broadcast like this but man it really came home for me when
[1:54:45.240 --> 1:54:50.840]  I learned that my son was in a store and there was a person there assaulting

[2:00:03.160 --> 2:00:22.160]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[2:00:22.160 --> 2:00:34.560]  I can needs creation not destruction cooperation not contempt security not
[2:00:34.560 --> 2:00:44.960]  anarchy healing not hatred justice not chaos this is our mission and we will
[2:00:44.960 --> 2:00:54.160]  succeed 100% we will succeed our country always wins that is why I am taking
[2:00:54.160 --> 2:00:59.720]  immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security and
[2:00:59.720 --> 2:01:05.840]  safety in America I am mobilizing all available federal resources civilian and
[2:01:05.840 --> 2:01:12.920]  military to stop the rioting and looting to end the destruction and arson and to
[2:01:12.920 --> 2:01:18.360]  protect the rights of law-abiding Americans including your second amendment
[2:01:18.360 --> 2:01:26.360]  rights therefore the following measures are going into effect immediately first
[2:01:26.360 --> 2:01:32.640]  we are ending the riots and lawlessness that has spread throughout our country we
[2:01:32.640 --> 2:01:38.960]  will end it now today I have strongly recommended to every governor to deploy
[2:01:38.960 --> 2:01:47.040]  the National Guard in sufficient numbers that we dominate the streets mayors and
[2:01:47.040 --> 2:01:51.560]  governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the
[2:01:51.560 --> 2:01:57.160]  violence has been quelled if a city or state refuses to take the actions that
[2:01:57.160 --> 2:02:02.600]  are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents then I will
[2:02:02.600 --> 2:02:09.720]  deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them I am
[2:02:09.720 --> 2:02:16.640]  also taking swift and decisive action to protect our great capital Washington DC
[2:02:16.640 --> 2:02:24.360]  what happened in this city last night was a total disgrace as we speak I am
[2:02:24.360 --> 2:02:30.520]  dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers military personnel
[2:02:30.520 --> 2:02:38.320]  and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting looting vandalism assaults and
[2:02:38.320 --> 2:02:44.720]  the wanton destruction of property we are putting everybody on warning our
[2:02:44.720 --> 2:02:51.040]  seven o'clock curfew will be strictly enforced those who threaten innocent
[2:02:51.040 --> 2:02:56.640]  life and property will be arrested detained and prosecuted to the fullest
[2:02:56.640 --> 2:03:03.120]  extent of the law I want the organizers of this terror to be unnoticed that you
[2:03:03.120 --> 2:03:10.480]  will face severe criminal penalties and lengthy sentences in jail it was 25 years
[2:03:10.480 --> 2:03:15.080]  ago that I was contacted by members of the military and emergency management
[2:03:15.080 --> 2:03:18.920]  systems and police chiefs so I all interviewed on record that Bill Clinton
[2:03:18.920 --> 2:03:24.600]  had a plan to use the arming to trigger civil unrest martial law and gun
[2:03:24.600 --> 2:03:31.320]  confiscation and I was so green back at the time that I was getting documents
[2:03:31.320 --> 2:03:37.560]  from the FBI and and from the army about the Delta Force being trained for this
[2:03:37.560 --> 2:03:42.440]  and I went on air and like was like the Delta Force is planning to overthrow
[2:03:42.440 --> 2:03:46.360]  America and like years later they're like you we understand your it was we gave
[2:03:46.360 --> 2:03:49.200]  you the documents we didn't want to do this understand we're being given the
[2:03:49.200 --> 2:03:54.720]  orders hey I was 26 years old I had a talk show who who who got that I just
[2:03:54.720 --> 2:04:01.120]  wouldn't got it now I get it all later so I get how these young people get
[2:04:01.120 --> 2:04:06.200]  manipulated because even when I was given the information to stop it by the
[2:04:06.200 --> 2:04:12.720]  people in the Pentagon that didn't like it I didn't even know what to do with
[2:04:12.720 --> 2:04:21.320]  the information it's like pearls before swine and so all these years later here
[2:04:21.320 --> 2:04:25.760]  we are with the globalist the chai comms openly trying to destroy the country
[2:04:25.760 --> 2:04:29.400]  the police are in I mean they're just average people like us some are good
[2:04:29.400 --> 2:04:33.040]  some are bad most are good the firefighters almost all good people so a
[2:04:33.040 --> 2:04:35.560]  few babbles
[2:04:35.560 --> 2:04:43.960]  they're Americans and the globalists are trying to tear us all apart and
[2:04:43.960 --> 2:04:48.040]  manipulate us to stall the economy because the COVID hoax is failing and
[2:04:48.040 --> 2:04:53.840]  the economy is starting to come back and they're just so pissed man I double
[2:04:53.840 --> 2:04:57.760]  checked it it's acne brick of Berkshire Hathaway in more than 20 cities
[2:04:57.760 --> 2:05:02.200]  delivered pallets of bricks everywhere just dumped them off they just with a
[2:05:02.200 --> 2:05:06.880]  computer they hit a button delivered everywhere Apple just took over and said
[2:05:06.880 --> 2:05:10.080]  kill the police on their main feed everybody's phone was taken over like
[2:05:10.080 --> 2:05:16.040]  kill the police murder everybody these are these are the big dirty
[2:05:16.040 --> 2:05:19.280]  corporations doing this they're making their move they think they're gonna
[2:05:19.280 --> 2:05:22.960]  defeat Americans and defeat you they think we're that stupid and you know
[2:05:22.960 --> 2:05:30.760]  what I know at a spiritual gut level that they're gonna lose but then that's
[2:05:30.760 --> 2:05:33.760]  when I get the chill up my spine
[2:05:38.200 --> 2:05:45.960]  you understand they're gonna escalate and at a certain point we have to stop
[2:05:45.960 --> 2:05:52.400]  and ask ourselves he is not shutting them down aiding them and so I'm the
[2:05:52.400 --> 2:05:58.320]  anti-fascist I'm the anti-police state I tried to stop all this we're here now
[2:05:58.320 --> 2:06:04.560]  this is where we were brought you understand that if the Pentagon and
[2:06:04.560 --> 2:06:09.000]  what's left of the Justice Department and the president doesn't start
[2:06:09.000 --> 2:06:16.040]  decapitating the enemy last month we're gonna lose they're already setting up
[2:06:16.040 --> 2:06:19.880]  their whole civil war they think they're gonna sit it out in New Zealand and
[2:06:19.880 --> 2:06:31.040]  Hawaii and Tasmania and Switzerland no I'll assure you you're not let's just
[2:06:31.040 --> 2:06:37.560]  not go there because I don't want to kill these people I don't I don't want the
[2:06:37.560 --> 2:06:41.640]  globalist I don't care about them I just want them to real but see they're not
[2:06:41.640 --> 2:06:49.640]  gonna stop all they respect is their teeth knocked up and so I'm telling them
[2:06:49.640 --> 2:06:57.480]  now as a representative of the people if or anything were that do you really
[2:06:57.480 --> 2:07:01.080]  want us to kill you because you just keep asking for it over and over again
[2:07:01.080 --> 2:07:06.080]  and you keep I know you hate yourselves why don't you just commit suicide just
[2:07:06.080 --> 2:07:10.280]  kill yourselves or repent the God if you've got any soul left why do you want
[2:07:10.280 --> 2:07:12.960]  to burn everything down and I'll just all kill each other because we're not

[2:07:34.960 --> 2:07:41.640]  scrotum eyes Soros and all these other people that just like that they want
[2:07:41.640 --> 2:07:46.080]  us to die because they're already dead and I just want to tell Soros this you

[2:09:09.400 --> 2:09:13.720]  because God wants to burn you but because you chose your own Satanism and
[2:09:13.720 --> 2:09:19.160]  you will be imprisoned in a cell with your own soul to look at yourself for
[2:09:19.160 --> 2:09:27.760]  ever and you won't have us to feed on or kick around anymore so you are damned to
[2:09:27.760 --> 2:09:32.680]  hell you are committed to hell in the name of Jesus Christ you and all your
[2:09:32.680 --> 2:09:39.680]  people are now committed to the pit of hell forever in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:09:39.680 --> 2:09:49.240]  the lockdown is permanent dictatorship the lockdown is designed to have the
[2:09:49.240 --> 2:09:54.920]  public accept their basic rights being suspended and a global medical
[2:09:54.920 --> 2:10:00.880]  tyranny led by the WHO and the Bill and the Gates Foundation in full control
[2:10:00.880 --> 2:10:07.080]  many will submit through fear others will be bought off but in the end the
[2:10:07.080 --> 2:10:11.520]  globalists admit they're building a post-human world and now that we're
[2:10:11.520 --> 2:10:17.040]  inside the cage it's going to move very very quickly into its in game
[2:10:17.040 --> 2:10:23.080]  submission to this is a form of living death and committing the next generation
[2:10:23.080 --> 2:10:28.880]  and our own generation to a living hell that cannot be imagined until you're
[2:10:28.880 --> 2:10:34.000]  actually experiencing this this is your dignity your soul your future being
[2:10:34.000 --> 2:10:39.360]  torn inside out this is a scientific dictatorship taking full control of
[2:10:39.360 --> 2:10:44.280]  humanity for its own selfless disgusting power trip when it comes to
[2:10:44.280 --> 2:10:49.880]  regaining energy during the day convenience is key sure coffee candy
[2:10:49.880 --> 2:10:54.320]  and other highly sugar-filled drinks can give you a short boost but the crash
[2:10:54.320 --> 2:11:00.600]  always follows that's why we created a mixable energy formula to take on the
[2:11:00.600 --> 2:11:05.720]  go when you need a little help turbo force similar to other mix-in energy
[2:11:05.720 --> 2:11:11.640]  packets turbo force from infowars life utilizes vitamins amino acids and
[2:11:11.640 --> 2:11:18.000]  extracts used for hundreds of years across the world to provide focus clarity
[2:11:18.000 --> 2:11:23.080]  and a boost of energy when you need it turbo force is certainly a force to be
[2:11:23.080 --> 2:11:28.400]  reckoned with for portable affordable and tasty energy and speaking of
[2:11:28.400 --> 2:11:33.880]  affordable you can even try turbo force for a limited time at an incredible 40
[2:11:33.880 --> 2:11:39.040]  percent off don't wait till it's out of stock again and get turbo force right
[2:11:39.040 --> 2:11:44.640]  now only at infowarstore.com
[2:11:44.640 --> 2:11:58.440]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:11:58.440 --> 2:12:04.440]  Nickelodeon is now brainwashing kids with George Floyd propaganda live from
[2:12:04.440 --> 2:12:19.280]  Austin Texas live from Austin Texas it's Alex Jones making the space jump
[2:12:19.280 --> 2:12:25.400]  alright Millie Weaver great independent journalist Millenia Millie joins us she
[2:12:25.400 --> 2:12:31.200]  was there covering so many crazy things yesterday she's got a lot to cover a lot
[2:12:31.200 --> 2:12:35.600]  to go over but Millie just your prime approximation with you and your great
[2:12:35.600 --> 2:12:41.000]  crew about what's happening in 2020 with 153 days out what do you expect to
[2:12:41.000 --> 2:12:45.920]  happen next I mean what is this period of history we're in right now well right
[2:12:45.920 --> 2:12:52.160]  now we're seeing an armed uprising of leftist organizations that is being run
[2:12:52.160 --> 2:12:57.800]  by military generals and swamp creatures this is an uprising it's gonna be
[2:12:57.800 --> 2:13:02.640]  similar to what we saw in Ukraine we have had the opportunity you said it's
[2:13:02.640 --> 2:13:07.680]  like Arab Spring and it's all run by globalists you're absolutely right okay
[2:13:07.680 --> 2:13:11.560]  so this is breaking news it's a little bit premature we were hoping to get it
[2:13:11.560 --> 2:13:16.720]  out later and get it out with more detail but the problem is is they started
[2:13:16.720 --> 2:13:21.440]  off this uprising sooner than we had anticipated we have had an infiltrator
[2:13:21.440 --> 2:13:25.840]  inside their green movements aside I told me about this weeks ago
[2:13:25.840 --> 2:13:30.400]  ready to start talking about this we are gonna start releasing the documents
[2:13:30.400 --> 2:13:34.960]  we've had an infiltrator he's he she's been in there for two years now by the
[2:13:34.960 --> 2:13:39.320]  way I've seen it folks this is project Veritas level next level I mean this is
[2:13:39.320 --> 2:13:43.920]  just devastating it's huge by the way Millie you didn't tell me you were
[2:13:43.920 --> 2:13:46.840]  ready to do this today so you just sprung this on me we've been talking for
[2:13:46.840 --> 2:13:51.880]  months about this you're go ahead we're gonna be releasing this I'm sorry to
[2:13:51.880 --> 2:13:56.640]  spring it on you Alex no matter you all people know like this is this is crazy it
[2:13:56.640 --> 2:14:01.360]  needs to get out AOC all these Democrat leaders have been working with the
[2:14:01.360 --> 2:14:04.320]  Sunrise movement this is the same movement that pushed the green new deal
[2:14:04.320 --> 2:14:09.640]  okay they have been training high school and junior high school age children
[2:14:09.640 --> 2:14:14.600]  for the past couple years kids as young as seven years old that they call it a
[2:14:14.600 --> 2:14:20.040]  malice movement they've done it you've got hidden video inside the classrooms
[2:14:20.040 --> 2:14:26.040]  brainwashing the kids hidden video of zoom conferences AOCs in these videos the
[2:14:26.040 --> 2:14:29.640]  leaderships in these videos talking about the riots talking about escalating
[2:14:29.640 --> 2:14:33.360]  and continuing your work and your nine-year-old daughter is home they're
[2:14:33.360 --> 2:14:37.720]  being brainwashed by the Communist Party exactly they are brainwashing the
[2:14:37.720 --> 2:14:41.560]  youth that's what they're doing and not only that Alex we have their entire
[2:14:41.560 --> 2:14:45.920]  mirrored servers we have it all we have all their internal communications
[2:14:45.920 --> 2:14:50.240]  documents we've got the receipts of them buying stuff it is insane what we have
[2:14:50.240 --> 2:14:54.520]  we have the connections where they're actually getting direct communications
[2:14:54.520 --> 2:14:59.120]  from military contract groups there's a military group called asymmetrical
[2:14:59.120 --> 2:15:07.520]  systems actually their CEO of the Sunrise movement Aaron Berger he is also
[2:15:07.520 --> 2:15:12.560]  the CEO for asymmetric solutions which is a private military and cybersecurity
[2:15:12.560 --> 2:15:17.400]  contracting company many of these contracted groups also have contracts
[2:15:17.400 --> 2:15:22.560]  with the military they they're teaching them tactical military maneuvers
[2:15:22.560 --> 2:15:27.760]  organization strategies communications that's like Bernard Kerrick former you
[2:15:27.760 --> 2:15:33.000]  know in NYPD Commissioner said this is military precision this is this isn't
[2:15:33.000 --> 2:15:37.360]  just terrorism this is organized overthrow of the government I mean
[2:15:37.360 --> 2:15:42.520]  some people like oh Trump's gonna respond and arrest him he's a tyrant the only thing
[2:15:42.520 --> 2:15:46.720]  he can do they should send the Green Berets in to literally just deal with
[2:15:46.720 --> 2:15:50.120]  the and I don't mean the idiot protesters you cut the head off the snake
[2:15:50.120 --> 2:15:55.320]  it's done but you've got these arrogant contractors that are funded by China that
[2:15:55.320 --> 2:15:58.800]  literally think America is a chump and is over so so since you're gonna get to
[2:15:58.800 --> 2:16:00.880]  it Millie I didn't know you were gonna do this today I know you were getting ready
[2:16:00.880 --> 2:16:05.320]  for it start over right now begin at the beginning and tell people what you've
[2:16:05.320 --> 2:16:10.320]  got okay so we have had somebody infiltrate the Sunrise Movement for the
[2:16:10.320 --> 2:16:15.800]  past two years they've went under as an NGO globalist overthrow America group
[2:16:15.800 --> 2:16:20.800]  yes it is the same group that Bernie Sanders was endorsed by a communist is
[2:16:20.800 --> 2:16:25.440]  it yes they these Democrats are in league with these groups they say that
[2:16:25.440 --> 2:16:29.760]  they're a no because they're candy-ass leftist they just think they're allowed
[2:16:29.760 --> 2:16:36.000]  to do this they're progressive communists many of these same groups black lives
[2:16:36.000 --> 2:16:40.440]  matter all of them if you if you follow the leaves up to the same branch it's
[2:16:40.440 --> 2:16:45.520]  all the same this is being run by the World Bank by the Club of Rome and
[2:16:45.520 --> 2:16:49.360]  believe it or not the internal documents we have show that AOC is a member of the
[2:16:49.360 --> 2:16:53.600]  Club of Rome course I mean these people aren't who they say they are it is
[2:16:53.600 --> 2:16:58.120]  worse than we think they are terrorists like Ilhan Omar I mean this is going down
[2:16:58.120 --> 2:17:04.120]  they are no this is a literal brotherhood new world or takeover absolutely Alex
[2:17:04.120 --> 2:17:07.360]  and they have the military on their side so that is why it is so planned and
[2:17:07.360 --> 2:17:11.760]  coordinated we've seen that we see pallets of bricks being delivered we've
[2:17:11.760 --> 2:17:17.880]  seen them interfering with police let's be clear they have a large slice of the
[2:17:17.880 --> 2:17:23.240]  military command under their control yes and they use discord chats they use
[2:17:23.240 --> 2:17:30.680]  Google Docs they use all of these private encrypted chats well they use it to
[2:17:30.680 --> 2:17:34.720]  communicate their orchestration of their plans does that make sense and we were
[2:17:34.720 --> 2:17:39.320]  able to get inside we got servers we got everything we've got their internal
[2:17:39.320 --> 2:17:43.600]  documents we have their plans with them they've got a graph that says the
[2:17:43.600 --> 2:17:48.120]  momentum cycle how it talks about the different periods of the uprising you
[2:17:48.120 --> 2:17:51.640]  know they know they're in they want to hijack our revolution to restore the
[2:17:51.640 --> 2:17:55.160]  republic and so and you've gotten just like we got the critical documents I'm
[2:17:55.160 --> 2:17:58.160]  not bringing this up to go oh look we have documents just like we got
[2:17:58.160 --> 2:18:01.800]  documents about how they plan the uprising and how it's all admitted now
[2:18:01.800 --> 2:18:06.800]  we're trying to expose this to people that we have their plans so yes Trump
[2:18:06.800 --> 2:18:10.520]  must act now please continue well one of the things that I found kind of
[2:18:10.520 --> 2:18:14.200]  shocking is inside when they're communicating about the new normal
[2:18:14.200 --> 2:18:18.640]  their new normal is a code word and it doesn't have anything to do with code
[2:18:18.640 --> 2:18:23.360]  19 Alex it has everything to do with this uprising and the new normal is
[2:18:23.360 --> 2:18:26.840]  going to be this uprising the violence it's going to continue and escalate
[2:18:26.840 --> 2:18:31.040]  their new normal so that's one of the weird things we saw in the documents new
[2:18:31.040 --> 2:18:35.440]  normals actually code word and them pushing for all these masks everything
[2:18:35.440 --> 2:18:39.600]  it was part of their plan they can use the mask to be able to go out there
[2:18:39.600 --> 2:18:44.440]  conceal their identity now they're everybody's anti-fit was to make them
[2:18:44.440 --> 2:18:48.960]  feel powerful look everyone's exactly everyone's wearing a mask every I think
[2:18:48.960 --> 2:18:51.760]  I got a call from a high-level really smart guy he goes two weeks ago just
[2:18:51.760 --> 2:18:55.360]  listen the mask or the cover of the criminal takeover the mask is meant to
[2:18:55.360 --> 2:18:59.280]  make aunt even believe this is their code see we're in charge everyone's
[2:18:59.280 --> 2:19:03.600]  wearing a mask you just said it no there's a group called momentum it's an
[2:19:03.600 --> 2:19:08.920]  organization that has been training these people how to protest how to riot how
[2:19:08.920 --> 2:19:14.160]  to overthrow how to use these tactics they have different names like fire mage
[2:19:14.160 --> 2:19:20.080]  light mage or you know fire mages are the ones that throw the the multi cocktails
[2:19:20.080 --> 2:19:24.960]  they have different people Alex it's all coordinated and organized they have the
[2:19:24.960 --> 2:19:28.880]  medics we hear them in the video footage medic medic it is all coordinated they
[2:19:28.880 --> 2:19:33.280]  have assigned roles for all these protesters they have peaceful protesters
[2:19:33.280 --> 2:19:36.680]  as one of the roles where they just go back like they're just peaceful people
[2:19:36.680 --> 2:19:41.480]  getting hurt the only action is not by we the people but I mean it's
[2:19:41.480 --> 2:19:45.720]  decapitation I mean the government if it's legitimate needs to stop this
[2:19:45.720 --> 2:19:50.600]  foreign insurrection and it needs to decapitate the leadership exactly this
[2:19:50.600 --> 2:19:54.920]  was preplanned I've been looking at last night I was going down a rabbit hole I
[2:19:54.920 --> 2:19:58.360]  was up late I was just looking at all these private communications these
[2:19:58.360 --> 2:20:01.400]  tweets even some of these tweets are public where they're posting oh thanks
[2:20:01.400 --> 2:20:04.840]  for the money for the supplies I'm gonna be putting it up on the discord and I'm
[2:20:04.840 --> 2:20:08.720]  gonna be putting up on the Google doc and it's all Hollywood and billionaires
[2:20:08.720 --> 2:20:13.880]  and Warren Buffett just funding it oh they just don't care they're proud of
[2:20:13.880 --> 2:20:18.560]  it they're funding it and some of these same groups were previously in the months
[2:20:18.560 --> 2:20:23.600]  prior they were putting these funds to bail out prisoners and people from jail
[2:20:23.600 --> 2:20:28.600]  to get them out of prison because they were saying COVID-19 was endangering
[2:20:28.600 --> 2:20:34.520]  them so we saw all these releases they started the war now they're gonna get it
[2:20:34.520 --> 2:20:37.560]  well they're right back stay with us they think we're going to prison camps

[2:21:55.120 --> 2:21:59.280]  social distancing and you're only allowed to have a list of 10 people that
[2:21:59.280 --> 2:22:04.040]  you visit and if you go outside that list of 10 you'll be permanently detained
[2:22:04.040 --> 2:22:08.400]  yes ladies and gentlemen this is the new world order where they let the

[2:22:12.800 --> 2:22:18.000]  you are now non-essential and a prisoner from the beginning of my research it
[2:22:18.000 --> 2:22:21.800]  was clear the globalist are an authoritarian anti-human group they
[2:22:21.800 --> 2:22:25.840]  have to put this electronic straightjacket on us before they carry out
[2:22:25.840 --> 2:22:31.200]  their in-game which is global depopulation so you see submitting to
[2:22:31.200 --> 2:22:36.480]  them is death the only way to stop them is to expose them to hate their guts
[2:22:36.480 --> 2:22:42.840]  and realize they are humanity's mortal enemy wake up or die
[2:22:42.840 --> 2:22:48.040]  we're living in insanely dangerous times and I told folks going back three
[2:22:48.040 --> 2:22:51.640]  months ago I'm not buying storeable food because I'm worried about the COVID-19
[2:22:51.640 --> 2:22:54.880]  virus I'm worried about the food shortages and the economic collapse and
[2:22:54.880 --> 2:22:58.600]  now it's admitted that a chain reaction has begun that's already caused food
[2:22:58.600 --> 2:23:02.320]  shortages and the collapse of farms and ranches across the United States and
[2:23:02.320 --> 2:23:05.560]  it's even worse in the third world so I hope Trump with his initiatives can
[2:23:05.560 --> 2:23:09.760]  clean this up and fix it but with the election fraud and the COVID-19 all the
[2:23:09.760 --> 2:23:13.840]  wars and the third world collapsing and everything else is going on now is the
[2:23:13.840 --> 2:23:17.600]  time to get storeable foods because they'll last for 25 years they're an
[2:23:17.600 --> 2:23:21.560]  easily totable bags it's high quality food and it's good to have that box
[2:23:21.560 --> 2:23:24.600]  checked off to be ready and it funds the info war so we have storeable food

[2:23:32.820 --> 2:23:36.520]  dependent on them they do not want you to be self-sufficient get your storeable
[2:23:36.520 --> 2:23:41.440]  food infowarstore.com right now while you still can
[2:23:41.440 --> 2:23:53.240]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:23:59.240 --> 2:24:09.000]  everything everything originates from the seed of determination I don't
[2:24:09.000 --> 2:24:12.040]  normally go off what fortune cookies have to say but I got some Chinese food
[2:24:12.040 --> 2:24:16.240]  today and I said let me open both these up and see what they have to say just
[2:24:16.240 --> 2:24:20.840]  now during the break I was scarfing down an egg roll and it says everything
[2:24:20.840 --> 2:24:25.520]  originates from the seed of determination exactly if info wars has one
[2:24:25.520 --> 2:24:30.080]  thing it's determination and it's that understanding that we just can't turn our
[2:24:30.080 --> 2:24:34.480]  wills over to others at least unconsciously consciously turned over to
[2:24:34.480 --> 2:24:38.320]  God that's great but God doesn't take control your will God in powers your
[2:24:38.320 --> 2:24:44.200]  will that's the big secret the Satanists don't know they think oh Satan
[2:24:44.200 --> 2:24:50.320]  empowers the will no it's the other way around another one dreams are extremely
[2:24:50.320 --> 2:24:58.280]  important you can't do it unless you imagine it two really good points they
[2:24:58.280 --> 2:25:02.240]  didn't come from G.G. Payne Millie Weaver I know you've been working on this for
[2:25:02.240 --> 2:25:06.680]  months you guys about infiltrator inside you've got all the data I told you
[2:25:06.680 --> 2:25:11.000]  weeks ago I said just just give it to Project Veritas they're really good at
[2:25:11.000 --> 2:25:15.800]  getting stuff out I mean hell we don't want the glory this is a really dangerous
[2:25:15.800 --> 2:25:21.720]  thing you guys have done I've seen a lot of it it's it's very damning and to
[2:25:21.720 --> 2:25:24.960]  realize they've got the kids they're not just doing drag queen story time out in
[2:25:24.960 --> 2:25:27.800]  open with convicted pedophiles bouncing six-year-old girls on their knee and
[2:25:27.800 --> 2:25:33.200]  little boys they are in there man they are brainwashing there this is Marxist
[2:25:33.200 --> 2:25:39.760]  this is Maoist this is hardcore and this is their big push that's why what do you
[2:25:39.760 --> 2:25:42.400]  expect them to do next and then and then and then get back into these
[2:25:42.400 --> 2:25:45.560]  documents and when are you guys gonna put these out on the internet so folks
[2:25:45.560 --> 2:25:50.320]  can see them because you've announced it now they're coming for you oh yeah
[2:25:50.320 --> 2:25:54.000]  they've already been coming for they know that we have them so we're trying to
[2:25:54.000 --> 2:25:57.080]  get them out as soon as we can Alex they're gonna be out within a day or two
[2:25:57.080 --> 2:26:00.840]  I mean we are getting it out fast and we've already put out a little and it's
[2:26:00.840 --> 2:26:05.040]  a blueprint for the total takeover of our children while your kids at school you
[2:26:05.040 --> 2:26:09.360]  don't know they're literally being taken over oh yeah and I already put a clip
[2:26:09.360 --> 2:26:13.160]  out on my Twitter Millie Weaver Millie underscore Weaver on Twitter if you
[2:26:13.160 --> 2:26:17.480]  guys want to see that but yeah it is it's bad Alex they actually have some
[2:26:17.480 --> 2:26:21.400]  teachers in league with this group the Sunrise Movement so we have actual
[2:26:21.400 --> 2:26:28.000]  teachers grooming and then directing underage children to these green party
[2:26:28.000 --> 2:26:31.520]  organizations that are communist organizations so these children are
[2:26:31.520 --> 2:26:36.040]  being secretly groomed behind their parents back orchestrating and
[2:26:36.040 --> 2:26:40.200]  coordinating with private chats encrypted chats with children private zoom
[2:26:40.200 --> 2:26:44.080]  conferences with children we had to blur out some of the faces in the video we
[2:26:44.080 --> 2:26:49.200]  just released because they are underage kids Alex it's that bad you have people
[2:26:49.200 --> 2:26:54.960]  using NLP high-level and this is literally potbellied communist brainwashing
[2:26:54.960 --> 2:26:59.600]  children without their parents knowing with extreme pleasure oh yeah and they're
[2:26:59.600 --> 2:27:03.120]  all well-meaning liberals that's why you see the police chiefs and everyone
[2:27:03.120 --> 2:27:07.160]  going oh America's bad yes kill white people and it's a white guy saying it
[2:27:07.160 --> 2:27:12.080]  it's all a cult of guilt it's a literal cult takeover it's all right we
[2:27:12.080 --> 2:27:15.800]  secretly talk to your kid without them knowing because it's the course they
[2:27:15.800 --> 2:27:20.920]  all had the LGBT sexualization but look at the cult leaders that are running it
[2:27:20.920 --> 2:27:26.040]  I mean this is who's secretly talking to your children God and these young kids
[2:27:26.040 --> 2:27:30.480]  think that this is an organic uprising an organic movement it's not it's being
[2:27:30.480 --> 2:27:39.440]  run by the military industrial complex it's being yeah okay so the II a
[2:27:39.440 --> 2:27:44.520]  operations that we're seeing on Twitter and on social media right now that has
[2:27:44.520 --> 2:27:49.560]  been tracked back to military generals general Hayden general Jim Jones these
[2:27:49.560 --> 2:27:54.560]  are Obama people that worked in the Obama administration Alex these people
[2:27:54.560 --> 2:27:59.680]  they are planning to do an armed overthrow a violent overthrow they have
[2:27:59.680 --> 2:28:05.240]  their hands in this it is insane so an II a operation and interactive internet
[2:28:05.240 --> 2:28:10.800]  activities operation that is basically where you have these systems you have a
[2:28:10.800 --> 2:28:16.320]  system called shadow net Patrick Berge he was one of the pioneers he developed
[2:28:16.320 --> 2:28:20.760]  this software for the military to be used in Iraq and Iran some of this
[2:28:20.760 --> 2:28:24.400]  technology because these private corporations were able to keep it after
[2:28:24.400 --> 2:28:29.040]  the contracts were up that same technology was used in the Ukraine to help
[2:28:29.040 --> 2:28:33.280]  with the Ukraine uprising folks that don't know you today for folks that don't
[2:28:33.280 --> 2:28:38.520]  know if you just type into a search engine Obama legalizes CIA propaganda in
[2:28:38.520 --> 2:28:44.400]  the United States they'll get foreign affairs all these articles and so this
[2:28:44.400 --> 2:28:48.520]  is taxpayer money being used by stay-behind networks in the government
[2:28:48.520 --> 2:28:53.640]  the bureaucracy to engage in this and then mobilize the riots the murder the
[2:28:53.640 --> 2:29:00.560]  death everything you see oh yeah it's pretty bad Alex so basically military
[2:29:00.560 --> 2:29:05.920]  weapons are being used on American citizens the social media is in on it
[2:29:05.920 --> 2:29:09.720]  these terrorist activities well that's why they're so arrogant cuz you're
[2:29:09.720 --> 2:29:13.080]  knows all this I mean have you noticed that Tucker Carlson's come out against
[2:29:13.080 --> 2:29:17.120]  Kushner and it's just totally I mean risking his job everything to say that
[2:29:17.120 --> 2:29:22.160]  Kushner works for the deep state is literally sabotaging Trump yeah you
[2:29:22.160 --> 2:29:25.800]  have people within the deep state that are on the right wing side of things and
[2:29:25.800 --> 2:29:29.280]  right now they're trying to tell President Trump not to have a strong
[2:29:29.280 --> 2:29:32.760]  response oh you don't want to be called a dictator President Trump you don't want
[2:29:32.760 --> 2:29:37.000]  to be seen as too harsh though you know that the left will criticize them anyway
[2:29:37.000 --> 2:29:43.000]  today hashtag president dictator Trump dictatorship is trending so they don't
[2:29:43.000 --> 2:29:47.280]  care they're going to use anyway they'll gaslight they'll lie they'll smear
[2:29:47.280 --> 2:29:50.720]  him he needs to come down hard he needs to declare the insurrection
[2:29:50.720 --> 2:29:54.760]  insurrection act and he needs to get the National Guard in here exactly because
[2:29:54.760 --> 2:29:59.720]  this is a martial law we're being put into globalist martial law where we had
[2:29:59.720 --> 2:30:03.640]  no rights this is duly elected government needs to challenge this foreign
[2:30:03.640 --> 2:30:08.540]  globalist operation and stop it deadness tracks oh yeah and we have
[2:30:08.540 --> 2:30:14.800]  Democrats like for instance on the Hunt Hill Bridge in Dallas last night the
[2:30:14.800 --> 2:30:20.360]  military the National Guard put up her tweet guys Millie's tweet yes they were
[2:30:20.360 --> 2:30:25.520]  able to actually corral the rioters on to the bridge they had both sides of the
[2:30:25.520 --> 2:30:29.920]  bridge closed off they were trapped so the military police were able to make
[2:30:29.920 --> 2:30:34.040]  large arrests they arrested everyone hundreds of people about 300 people
[2:30:34.040 --> 2:30:40.080]  rioters terrorists okay we're arrested and apprehended for breaking curfew
[2:30:40.080 --> 2:30:43.720]  that's what they were able to get them with now of course the leftists are all
[2:30:43.720 --> 2:30:47.600]  on social media saying these are peaceful protesters they're peaceful
[2:30:47.600 --> 2:30:51.920]  protesters no they're not they're criminals peaceful protesters don't
[2:30:51.920 --> 2:30:55.280]  break the law they don't commit crimes okay they wouldn't be out there because
[2:30:55.280 --> 2:30:59.640]  they wouldn't be wanting to violate a curfew that's not true but the point is
[2:30:59.640 --> 2:31:02.960]  if somebody's caught on tape doing something they're criminal this is done
[2:31:02.960 --> 2:31:07.960]  by foreign powers it's one thing citizens do stuff is it lawful isn't it we
[2:31:07.960 --> 2:31:12.360]  look at each case this is a globalist literally saying they're overthrowing the
[2:31:12.360 --> 2:31:16.520]  country and like you said they don't care anymore they just brainwash kids they
[2:31:16.520 --> 2:31:21.080]  just put out fake news they say Millie that we burned down the the homeless camp
[2:31:21.080 --> 2:31:26.000]  totally made up so as soon as myself and other law-abiding Americans were
[2:31:26.000 --> 2:31:31.320]  applauding this you know capture of these rioters these terrorists sooner
[2:31:31.320 --> 2:31:35.280]  than we could even like enjoy the fact that these people are being apprehended
[2:31:35.280 --> 2:31:40.600]  and we can sleep peacefully and rest peacefully we hear that the Democrat DA
[2:31:40.600 --> 2:31:46.920]  John Crutes decides he's going to release them so the military police take
[2:31:46.920 --> 2:31:51.480]  all these these rioters these terrorists down you have the blue states and blue
[2:31:51.480 --> 2:31:55.800]  cities encouraging insurrection to kill the economy and that's the bottom line
[2:31:55.800 --> 2:32:00.520]  the covert hoax this whole thing is about depression folks wrecking the
[2:32:00.520 --> 2:32:03.960]  country because we didn't go along with the New World Order all right Millie
[2:32:03.960 --> 2:32:08.080]  you it's great that you let this out today you got all this when are you I
[2:32:08.080 --> 2:32:12.000]  know you've already released some of it when are you gonna start releasing the
[2:32:12.000 --> 2:32:15.520]  cash that shows the brainwashing of America's children at school while
[2:32:15.520 --> 2:32:19.360]  parents think they're being taught about you know Millerites Constitution
[2:32:19.360 --> 2:32:23.560]  mathematics reading writing arithmetic they're being taught Mao Zedong and
[2:32:23.560 --> 2:32:27.160]  you'll kill your parents when is that gonna start coming out well it's gonna
[2:32:27.160 --> 2:32:31.800]  be released in waves and we're we're going to release stuff tomorrow starting
[2:32:31.800 --> 2:32:35.440]  we already released video today of private internal conferences where
[2:32:35.440 --> 2:32:41.160]  Alexandria Ocasio Cortez is calling for more uprising and more continuation of
[2:32:41.160 --> 2:32:45.240]  the riots that we're seeing even though publicly she's saying to do not she's
[2:32:45.240 --> 2:32:48.720]  saying everyone should not be writing so we've got that out today but we're gonna
[2:32:48.720 --> 2:32:51.680]  continue to get more and we're gonna be releasing the docs because it's going to
[2:32:51.680 --> 2:32:55.840]  take days we have the gigabytes I tell folks five-minute Millennium Millie on

[2:33:14.000 --> 2:33:19.160]  got I was trying to look at a few weeks ago it's it's the stuff is so horrible
[2:33:19.160 --> 2:33:24.120]  though that I started crying watching it like weird pervert looking dudes man with
[2:33:24.120 --> 2:33:28.320]  your kids I mean we're talking like Jeffrey Dahmer looking people like
[2:33:28.320 --> 2:33:33.240]  Tommy perverts man while your kids at school they are literally under comic
[2:33:33.240 --> 2:33:38.000]  control when this footage comes out it's way worse than the Pito Gates stuff I
[2:33:38.000 --> 2:33:41.360]  mean this is just they're molesting their minds I don't like coming to you
[2:33:41.360 --> 2:33:44.920]  every day on the radio and TV stations that you watch and listen to a song and
[2:33:44.920 --> 2:33:48.480]  telling you all these horrible things but you notice almost everything we've
[2:33:48.480 --> 2:33:54.080]  talked about horrible has come true we were warning everybody to try to stop it
[2:33:54.080 --> 2:33:58.320]  it's like telling somebody if you got a pool put a fence around it if you have
[2:33:58.320 --> 2:34:01.360]  little kids because even if they're good swimmers they can hit their head and
[2:34:01.360 --> 2:34:05.280]  drown people don't listen they go out and their kids dead in the pool well
[2:34:05.280 --> 2:34:08.400]  ladies and gentlemen this is the death of the third world in the collapse of the
[2:34:08.400 --> 2:34:13.160]  first world and this is 21st century warfare carried out by the globalists
[2:34:13.160 --> 2:34:17.800]  and they admit they've orchestrated it they admit it's quote good to save the
[2:34:17.800 --> 2:34:21.640]  earth and they're teaching us to be more frugal and they want to make us poor so
[2:34:21.640 --> 2:34:26.560]  they can dictate our surrender to this post-human technocracy I know all this
[2:34:26.560 --> 2:34:30.680]  sounds insane when I was talking about it 25 years ago but now it's public
[2:34:30.680 --> 2:34:35.320]  because it's their operations manual I wish this wasn't the case but they're
[2:34:35.320 --> 2:34:38.960]  really our evil psychopaths in control of most major institutions that we've
[2:34:38.960 --> 2:34:43.120]  got to stop them I'm always excited about info wars life products they're
[2:34:43.120 --> 2:34:46.200]  amazing they're cutting-edge you love them I love them and they find the info
[2:34:46.200 --> 2:34:50.360]  war in the face of the globalist onslaught but we have come up with a
[2:34:50.360 --> 2:34:58.200]  new product over a year in development that is amazing the only organic hand
[2:34:58.200 --> 2:35:03.640]  sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top of it and there's
[2:35:03.640 --> 2:35:09.640]  another innovation it's the spray cap it doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick
[2:35:09.640 --> 2:35:15.360]  gross you goo but it's high quality it aerosolizes it in a really great way I
[2:35:15.360 --> 2:35:19.880]  like to put on my hands rub a little bit on my face it's got organic alcohol in
[2:35:19.880 --> 2:35:23.960]  it so spray it right in your eyes but I just love it personally it's something
[2:35:23.960 --> 2:35:27.920]  that's a moisturizer as well so this is a real innovation I don't know why
[2:35:27.920 --> 2:35:31.680]  others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has a
[2:35:31.680 --> 2:35:36.440]  central oil in it so it doesn't dry you out smells great it's so refreshing
[2:35:36.440 --> 2:35:40.000]  this is a big winner
[2:35:41.920 --> 2:35:46.880]  the United States is not communist China we don't have three million people in
[2:35:46.880 --> 2:35:51.480]  concentration camps we don't blow up churches we don't kill political
[2:35:51.480 --> 2:35:56.040]  dissidents and sell their organs but all of the news we see you in billable
[2:35:56.040 --> 2:36:01.920]  indicates WHO mainstream corporate media praising communist China for their
[2:36:01.920 --> 2:36:06.080]  response and if communist China shoots women at checkpoints and welds people
[2:36:06.080 --> 2:36:09.480]  into their houses and has robots controlling people well then gee we've
[2:36:09.480 --> 2:36:13.160]  got to do that and on top of it cities like San Antonio passed laws saying
[2:36:13.160 --> 2:36:17.720]  we'll arrest you if you say Chinese virus well now Cuomo in New York's calling
[2:36:17.720 --> 2:36:22.560]  it the European virus these people are out of control control freaks and they
[2:36:22.560 --> 2:36:26.440]  are gonna lose big time because we the people are aware of their criminal
[2:36:26.440 --> 2:36:30.840]  activities and are exposing them in their power grab the resistance lives at
[2:36:30.840 --> 2:36:35.560]  band.video and info wars dot com spread those links and jam it down the
[2:36:35.560 --> 2:36:39.200]  censors throats and then we'll be able to defeat their operation that much
[2:36:39.200 --> 2:36:46.640]  quicker info wars has become a symbol an emblem of not just American freedom but
[2:36:46.640 --> 2:36:51.840]  worldwide Maverick spirit it's not just myself or the host at info wars or the
[2:36:51.840 --> 2:36:56.680]  researchers or the journalist it's you the listeners the activists the people
[2:36:56.680 --> 2:37:01.800]  on the front lines in the arena and it's the amazing guests and individuals that
[2:37:01.800 --> 2:37:05.360]  we interviewed that make info wars so special because we're not putting a
[2:37:05.360 --> 2:37:09.800]  filter in front the free minds we're having an open discussion about the
[2:37:09.800 --> 2:37:13.400]  real state of the world not the establishment of talking points that
[2:37:13.400 --> 2:37:16.400]  are put out by the council on fine relations the boulderburton group
[2:37:16.400 --> 2:37:22.280]  Davos group and other club we're pushing for a pro human future where we build a
[2:37:22.280 --> 2:37:28.080]  planet and beyond based on humans for humans by humans not a world where the
[2:37:28.080 --> 2:37:32.560]  establishment hate themselves project their hate onto us and decide we're gonna
[2:37:32.560 --> 2:37:36.920]  have a post human world I'm really excited to know that info wars has your
[2:37:36.920 --> 2:37:42.360]  support I want to thank you all for being pro human and pro god
[2:37:43.120 --> 2:37:48.480]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:37:48.480 --> 2:38:11.240]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show well we
[2:38:11.240 --> 2:38:16.200]  knew this was coming a long time ago we made preparation for it analysis
[2:38:16.200 --> 2:38:21.560]  exactly as nasty and ugly and disgusting as we thought it was but we're not caught
[2:38:21.560 --> 2:38:28.680]  flat-footed and the generations of Americans continue on and my son was
[2:38:28.680 --> 2:38:34.120]  been on air for 18 years here popping in and out Rex Jones is here you know he's
[2:38:34.120 --> 2:38:37.440]  a little bit of trouble with me he came in this morning he showed me this video
[2:38:37.440 --> 2:38:41.160]  right for when alive on air and he said yeah this happened Sunday two days ago
[2:38:41.160 --> 2:38:45.440]  and about he got the footage today from the local convenience store by my parents
[2:38:45.440 --> 2:38:52.840]  he was over there visiting but this is bigger than Rex Jones or alex jones it's
[2:38:52.840 --> 2:38:57.400]  that two gun shops of the three or four I ever bought guns from have been robbed
[2:38:57.400 --> 2:39:02.400]  in Austin everybody I know is that their house is broken into their car or
[2:39:02.400 --> 2:39:07.600]  they've been car jacked I mean it my phone rings off the hook with crime and
[2:39:07.600 --> 2:39:13.440]  it's zombie black people white people you name it attacking other people because
[2:39:13.440 --> 2:39:17.200]  the green light like the purge is go out and attack but it's not white people
[2:39:17.200 --> 2:39:22.080]  given the real black people it's just a lawlessness over the past two or three
[2:39:22.080 --> 2:39:26.440]  years I have personally seen Austin go dramatically downhill and these these
[2:39:26.440 --> 2:39:29.840]  riots in the COVID thing it's an excuse for these people to just go out and be
[2:39:29.840 --> 2:39:33.000]  crazy and that's what I saw that's what I had to deal with it was completely
[2:39:33.000 --> 2:39:37.680]  insane the dude runs in just start screaming I'm protesting I'm protesting
[2:39:37.680 --> 2:39:46.560]  let's just fix your piece here you go like popped out of here here you go
[2:39:46.560 --> 2:39:50.960]  ahead there's your earpiece is fixed anyways my little babies here my first
[2:39:50.960 --> 2:39:56.280]  born Rex no but I mean because they tell people be homeless use drugs that they
[2:39:56.280 --> 2:40:00.120]  take the welfare check and buy drugs this is a Democrat formula to bring
[2:40:00.120 --> 2:40:05.000]  things down so we're gonna play this video here in a second and talk about
[2:40:05.000 --> 2:40:07.760]  what happened when the police said no he's a protester he's allowed to loot
[2:40:07.760 --> 2:40:12.400]  he tried to take the cash register they cut so what happened was start over
[2:40:12.400 --> 2:40:16.880]  let's start over start the beginning all right it's like 11 p.m. I walk into the
[2:40:16.880 --> 2:40:22.320]  gas station I buy ramen I go to the counter to pay for my ramen about halfway
[2:40:22.320 --> 2:40:26.480]  as a very trashy you're eating that whatever man whatever I was hungry so
[2:40:26.480 --> 2:40:30.640]  I'm walking to the counter with my ramen this dude runs in don't say ramen
[2:40:30.640 --> 2:40:36.680]  again with my food this dude runs in just starts yelling I'm protesting I'm
[2:40:36.680 --> 2:40:40.560]  protesting I'm protesting and grabs everything in sight he's running around
[2:40:40.560 --> 2:40:45.200]  the store so one of the clerks calls the cops the other dude tries to stop him
[2:40:45.200 --> 2:40:48.160]  he goes for the lottery ticket starts trying to break in the plastic lottery
[2:40:48.160 --> 2:40:52.920]  ticket thing at that point the store attendant with the man bun puts his hand
[2:40:52.920 --> 2:40:57.000]  on him and then the crackhead proceeds to drag him over to the open beer thing
[2:40:57.000 --> 2:41:02.040]  over there and starts smashing his head into the side of it and as you can see
[2:41:02.040 --> 2:41:07.120]  there I was I jumped in I tried to I stopped the crackhead I hit the crack
[2:41:07.120 --> 2:41:10.320]  at about eight times hard on the side of the head and he looked up at me with
[2:41:10.320 --> 2:41:14.280]  like gerbil eyes who's clearly whacked out on like PCP or something crazy and
[2:41:14.280 --> 2:41:17.880]  proceeded to run to the front of the store and threw a carton of fruit on me
[2:41:17.880 --> 2:41:21.320]  I punched him in the face again I broke his nose at that point he ran out of the
[2:41:21.320 --> 2:41:26.400]  store cops come cops cuff him he tells the cops that I assaulted him that the
[2:41:26.400 --> 2:41:30.480]  store owners are trying to steal from him and that he wanted me arrested and
[2:41:30.480 --> 2:41:34.240]  that he was protesting the cops holding there for like five or ten minutes they
[2:41:34.240 --> 2:41:40.320]  let him go he proceeds to pass out bloody in front of the store this is
[2:41:40.320 --> 2:41:44.560]  America this is America in 2020 this is America we're rioting and looting and
[2:41:44.560 --> 2:41:48.520]  pillaging is totally normal because George Floyd who in my opinion was
[2:41:48.520 --> 2:41:51.640]  murdered because this because this happened because this one dude was
[2:41:51.640 --> 2:41:55.680]  murdered it justifies the looting and pillaging and robbing coming out now
[2:41:55.680 --> 2:41:59.400]  though that this this bar they ran was like a whorehouse drug dealing facility
[2:41:59.400 --> 2:42:02.880]  and the cops were involved Floyd was involved it looks like some kind of like
[2:42:02.880 --> 2:42:06.480]  gangland stuff that I don't know the whole situation from what I saw I don't
[2:42:06.480 --> 2:42:09.880]  like it but my point being is even if he was a bad person which I don't think he
[2:42:09.880 --> 2:42:14.480]  was my point being is this whole situation this that does not justify this
[2:42:14.480 --> 2:42:19.520]  kind of behavior the killing of one man justifies protest justifies outrage but
[2:42:19.520 --> 2:42:23.480]  doesn't justify the burning of cities it doesn't justify this I mean you know
[2:42:23.480 --> 2:42:26.120]  your only problem is you're hitting in the back of the head you should have
[2:42:26.120 --> 2:42:30.400]  uppercut it but you want to hit that would have been a lot better breakfast you
[2:42:30.400 --> 2:42:33.120]  know I was scared in that situation I didn't know what to do you can see me
[2:42:33.120 --> 2:42:37.040]  there go back to the video good well no no no no no I'm being honest my what
[2:42:37.040 --> 2:42:41.800]  what whatever and maybe I should hit you in the face um yeah look look in that
[2:42:41.800 --> 2:42:44.720]  situation I was scared there was like a six foot six dude standing that guy's
[2:42:44.720 --> 2:42:48.040]  that guy's huge the camera doesn't do him justice I kept on looking over to him
[2:42:48.040 --> 2:42:50.800]  thinking he would do something and then at one point I was just like all right I
[2:42:50.800 --> 2:42:54.600]  guess I had to jump in and do something and I'll be honest I was I was
[2:42:54.600 --> 2:42:58.320]  terrified but I mean I had to do it and now that I've been all I know is we love
[2:42:58.320 --> 2:43:10.680]  our Somalis oh they're so good oh they're so sweet they're gonna stab your
[2:43:10.680 --> 2:43:21.920]  daughter at the mall your wife your son say it your wife your son and then the
[2:43:21.920 --> 2:43:29.760]  police chief's gonna say we love our Somalis we love our Muslims oh they so
[2:43:29.760 --> 2:43:35.960]  good oh they so sweet that's good stuff right there you're in a good mood today
[2:43:35.960 --> 2:43:41.080]  man well you're friendly to be here in a good mood for all this this let's get
[2:43:41.080 --> 2:43:45.120]  back to talking about the horrible stuff going on I personally know people not
[2:43:45.120 --> 2:43:48.440]  friends of mine I know people and I've seen their posts on snapchat and
[2:43:48.440 --> 2:43:52.280]  Instagram social media I know like juniors in high school that are going out
[2:43:52.280 --> 2:43:57.200]  and looting liquor stores this stuff it's just further I'm telling you I want
[2:43:57.200 --> 2:43:59.320]  listeners to know because I know you're all in your community you're seeing what
[2:43:59.320 --> 2:44:04.280]  you're seeing I'm here in Austin Texas it's robbery land I mean because I'm not
[2:44:04.280 --> 2:44:08.120]  a people just don't care my house out the other day and I like get out of the
[2:44:08.120 --> 2:44:12.960]  car start reaching for my shotgun I mean it's getting bad you are not safe unless
[2:44:12.960 --> 2:44:16.720]  you are armed and I think of the gun control argument for one is dead after
[2:44:16.720 --> 2:44:21.080]  this you can't say there's no reason for you to need an air 15 after after cities
[2:44:21.080 --> 2:44:25.760]  are on fire I mean but as long as the police bow to the BLM or things okay
[2:44:25.760 --> 2:44:29.120]  and why haven't we heard anything about COVID-19 why haven't we heard anything
[2:44:29.120 --> 2:44:31.920]  about coronavirus because the German government came out and said it is an
[2:44:31.920 --> 2:44:38.680]  official hoax this is America 2020 cities are on fire John here's the deal
[2:44:38.680 --> 2:44:42.160]  rendering impression the critical police when they're going under globalist
[2:44:42.160 --> 2:44:44.960]  control and being nanny states and I've got problems with them just like government
[2:44:44.960 --> 2:44:47.320]  they're the they're the bottom of the government you know the rubber meets the
[2:44:47.320 --> 2:44:51.040]  roads I don't make it about them like I'm against the TSA doing stuff but I'm
[2:44:51.040 --> 2:44:56.320]  not against the TSA agent but these leaders of the police I mean what are we
[2:44:56.320 --> 2:45:05.480]  paying you for when you sit there and they're doing contact tracing and six
[2:45:05.480 --> 2:45:12.200]  degrees of separation enforcement in New York in Texas in California have all
[2:45:12.200 --> 2:45:15.640]  the videos where the police are making sure social distancing is happening
[2:45:15.640 --> 2:45:20.280]  arresting people while two miles away buildings are burning it's completely
[2:45:20.280 --> 2:45:23.760]  insane I mean do you remember when you remember when in Richmond Virginia
[2:45:23.760 --> 2:45:27.520]  there was the gun when there is a gun protest that was seen as terrorism but
[2:45:27.520 --> 2:45:32.200]  this is protesting cities are on fire right going and exercising 50,000 gun
[2:45:32.200 --> 2:45:37.200]  owners not one crime committed only one leftist arrested and that's when the
[2:45:37.200 --> 2:45:40.440]  globalist launched COVID-19 in this they got so pissed they want oh my god they
[2:45:40.440 --> 2:45:44.160]  could have 50,000 gun owners together and they all acted unison and a third of
[2:45:44.160 --> 2:45:49.480]  more probably black or a bunch of Asians too that made the globalist rap bricks
[2:45:49.480 --> 2:45:53.160]  all these racist leftists they're obsessed with race-based narratives but
[2:45:53.160 --> 2:45:56.600]  we're us being unified by the right to self-defense this wasn't even like the
[2:45:56.600 --> 2:46:02.520]  store that got robbed I love the lady in the in the personal scooter being
[2:46:02.520 --> 2:46:06.960]  beat up I don't love it it's disgusting oh my god oh look she's a white lady
[2:46:06.960 --> 2:46:11.320]  let's beat her up and spray fire extinguisher on her like what is that
[2:46:11.320 --> 2:46:16.960]  like how is this woman your enemy there is no if in six months everyone is
[2:46:16.960 --> 2:46:22.280]  going to forget about this sadly like if this doesn't turn into a civil war
[2:46:22.280 --> 2:46:26.120]  civil war people will forget about it but in six months when David Hogg and all
[2:46:26.120 --> 2:46:28.960]  those freaking people are tweeting about how we need gun control and there's no
[2:46:28.960 --> 2:46:32.880]  reason for you to own large capacity magazines you need to show videos from
[2:46:32.880 --> 2:46:36.960]  this from this whole incident because when cities are on fire when stores are
[2:46:36.960 --> 2:46:39.560]  being looted when people are being stabbed and murdered in the streets and
[2:46:39.560 --> 2:46:43.960]  killed when people are being beaten to death by hordes and angry leftists this
[2:46:43.960 --> 2:46:47.800]  is why the second women exist I agree so let's go back let's go back to this guy
[2:46:47.800 --> 2:46:50.840]  because you only got some of the surveillance footage you're just in
[2:46:50.840 --> 2:46:55.240]  there he starts attacking in there he starts attacking people he so first off
[2:46:55.240 --> 2:46:59.400]  his pants are down to his ankles he starts throwing literally everything he
[2:46:59.400 --> 2:47:04.080]  can get chips drinks whatever in his pants and then he makes a beeline like
[2:47:04.080 --> 2:47:08.440]  Santa Claus's bag it was insane no it was completely insane and he runs over
[2:47:08.440 --> 2:47:11.120]  and starts trying to break into the lottery ticket thing he's going for
[2:47:11.120 --> 2:47:16.560]  lottery tickets the guy with the man bun there they out the man bun there on
[2:47:16.560 --> 2:47:19.760]  the right side of the screen he tries to stop him he pulls him over by his hair
[2:47:19.760 --> 2:47:22.680]  and starts beating his head into the side of the open beer container thing I
[2:47:22.680 --> 2:47:24.960]  don't know what it's called but it's really keep the like poor locals and
[2:47:24.960 --> 2:47:30.320]  stuff it's really bad it's really bad footage you mean you had to be there
[2:47:30.320 --> 2:47:35.000]  that guy had a dead gerbil eyes like I hit him in the back of the head eight
[2:47:35.000 --> 2:47:39.760]  times really hard I'm like I weigh like I weigh 205 pounds like it hurt and he
[2:47:39.760 --> 2:47:43.920]  like reared his head up like the Terminator and his he had no iris all
[2:47:43.920 --> 2:47:48.520]  pupil runs over to the front of the store throws a like box of fruit at me I
[2:47:48.520 --> 2:47:52.120]  punch him in the face I broke his nose he runs out of this he runs out into
[2:47:52.120 --> 2:47:57.200]  the street and escapes like two minutes later the cops come he comes back to the
[2:47:57.200 --> 2:48:01.480]  store pointing and screaming at me and saying that I assaulted him and that he
[2:48:01.480 --> 2:48:04.240]  was actually can't be around this stuff he should what do you mean I can't be
[2:48:04.240 --> 2:48:08.000]  around I was at a gas station getting food no I understand but I mean I was
[2:48:08.000 --> 2:48:12.560]  nowhere near downtown this is my fault this guy's a crazy fact I don't want to
[2:48:12.560 --> 2:48:18.200]  valuable do not engage the crack heads do not engage your crack heads not unless
[2:48:18.200 --> 2:48:21.800]  you know I have no choice man it's my here's where I'm at I'm carrying a gun
[2:48:21.800 --> 2:48:25.240]  and so somebody attacks me you're gonna talk to them you're gonna talk to the
[2:48:25.240 --> 2:48:32.720]  bullets I'm not I'm too old I'm not using the right back this is the end my
[2:48:32.720 --> 2:48:39.320]  friends my only friends the end of our elaborate plans the end of everything
[2:48:39.320 --> 2:48:45.880]  that stands the end the safety the delusion it's all over ladies and gentlemen
[2:48:45.880 --> 2:48:52.480]  because it was only the mirage of safety movies and partying and living like
[2:48:52.480 --> 2:48:57.240]  children ever growing up ever caring about other people this delivered us
[2:48:57.240 --> 2:49:01.600]  into the hands of tyranny just like the history book show it's just like the
[2:49:01.600 --> 2:49:05.600]  Bible states every time Israel became corrupt and evil and turned away from
[2:49:05.600 --> 2:49:11.760]  God they were brought into captivity because their people sold out to special
[2:49:11.760 --> 2:49:16.160]  interests that were infiltrated by spies and then they were enslaved we are
[2:49:16.160 --> 2:49:21.000]  repeating that again today compliance and going along with this system leads
[2:49:21.000 --> 2:49:27.120]  to absolute bondage info wars has decided to fight for freedom info wars
[2:49:27.120 --> 2:49:32.600]  that great victory thanks to your support and your prayers now it's official
[2:49:32.600 --> 2:49:36.920]  the United Nations came out yesterday and said the covert emergency will last
[2:49:36.920 --> 2:49:42.800]  five years and the UK government said you must all carry cell phones outside or
[2:49:42.800 --> 2:49:46.680]  you'll be arrested because we have to track your social distancing and you're
[2:49:46.680 --> 2:49:50.760]  only allowed to have a list of ten people that you visit and if you go
[2:49:50.760 --> 2:49:55.920]  outside that list of ten you'll be permanently detained yes ladies and
[2:49:55.920 --> 2:49:59.640]  gentlemen this is the new world order where they let the criminals out of jail
[2:49:59.640 --> 2:50:04.040]  the rapists the child molesters the murderers and where you are now
[2:50:04.040 --> 2:50:08.520]  non-essential and a prisoner from the beginning of my research it was clear
[2:50:08.520 --> 2:50:12.880]  the globalist are an authoritarian anti-human group they have to put this
[2:50:12.880 --> 2:50:17.360]  electronic straightjacket on us before they carry out their endgame which is
[2:50:17.360 --> 2:50:24.240]  global depopulation so you see submitting to them is death the only way to stop
[2:50:24.240 --> 2:50:28.840]  them is to expose them to hate their guts and realize they are humanity's
[2:50:28.840 --> 2:50:39.680]  mortal enemy wake up or die you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:50:48.040 --> 2:50:54.560]  I can see the headline Alan Jones' son burns down gas station murders innocent
[2:50:54.560 --> 2:50:58.960]  man in wheelchair that's what they say they say we burned down the I'm sure I
[2:50:58.960 --> 2:51:02.600]  can't if a camp that matter we have all the AC footage we didn't I'm sure I'll
[2:51:02.600 --> 2:51:07.320]  be accused of committing a hate crime yeah yeah yeah yeah all right look in
[2:51:07.320 --> 2:51:12.840]  closing Paul Joseph Watson's about to take over this is a very dangerous time
[2:51:12.840 --> 2:51:16.520]  right now it's a very very sad time and all these criminals have been given a
[2:51:16.520 --> 2:51:19.440]  green light to go crazy what do you think's coming next you know what I have
[2:51:19.440 --> 2:51:24.040]  never felt this generally uneasy about like I have I have this big fear of a
[2:51:24.040 --> 2:51:27.720]  really horrible mass shooting happening in the next couple of weeks I think Owen
[2:51:27.720 --> 2:51:29.920]  and you were right I think they're gonna stage a mass shooting I think that
[2:51:29.920 --> 2:51:32.760]  there's gonna be at least 30 are gonna say a white supremacist kills a bunch of
[2:51:32.760 --> 2:51:36.200]  black people yep to trigger them trigger the martial law it'll be so it'll be
[2:51:36.200 --> 2:51:39.560]  some guy that's whacked out on SSRIs he's gonna kill a whole mob of people it's
[2:51:39.560 --> 2:51:42.520]  gonna be really bad I have this horrible feeling about what's coming up
[2:51:42.520 --> 2:51:46.440]  because this is the perfect storm this is what they've always wanted you've had
[2:51:46.440 --> 2:51:50.400]  people locked in their homes for two or three months you have people that are
[2:51:50.400 --> 2:51:53.880]  angry and outraged about the death of this man give people out in the streets
[2:51:53.880 --> 2:51:58.840]  burning and looting and pillaging it only takes one person to go out that
[2:51:58.840 --> 2:52:02.960]  they might set up it only takes it only this is a perfect time for a false flag
[2:52:02.960 --> 2:52:07.000]  that's what I'm trying to say we're in the season of it this is exactly what
[2:52:07.000 --> 2:52:11.800]  they need to get the focus off of them because and get the focus off of them and
[2:52:11.800 --> 2:52:15.560]  get the focus on to the issues that they what they want to press so we should
[2:52:15.560 --> 2:52:21.880]  start fake hashtag fake mass shooting right now because it's coming I a hundred

[2:56:37.200 --> 2:57:04.560]  together we live in an era where truth is not determined by objective reality
[2:57:04.560 --> 2:57:11.200]  but by fear of consequences from the mob if you don't accept and amplify their
[2:57:11.200 --> 2:57:16.320]  version of it and I got a little taste of that because we have our own Black Lives
[2:57:16.320 --> 2:57:20.880]  Matter protests going on in London right now of course we had anti lockdown
[2:57:20.880 --> 2:57:25.280]  protests a couple of weeks ago the media publicly humiliated and shamed the
[2:57:25.280 --> 2:57:28.920]  people involved in those and many of them were arrested for not social
[2:57:28.920 --> 2:57:35.560]  distancing but thousands of Black Lives Matter and Tifa protesters descended on
[2:57:35.560 --> 2:57:41.480]  the US Embassy on Sunday afternoon to protest against the death of George
[2:57:41.480 --> 2:57:46.560]  Floyd and I had the great honor to be stuck right in the middle of that
[2:57:46.560 --> 2:57:52.040]  protest in a car on a boiling hot day with a massive hangover the two hours
[2:57:52.040 --> 2:57:57.440]  solid and this is what happened basically they blocked to the end of the road
[2:57:57.440 --> 2:58:01.680]  where the US Embassy is which is like nine minutes away from where I live
[2:58:01.680 --> 2:58:05.560]  blocked the road there was a line of police probably about 20 police officers
[2:58:05.560 --> 2:58:09.120]  doing absolutely nothing of course they were probably you know the rest of them
[2:58:09.120 --> 2:58:13.760]  were probably busy arresting people for mean tweets arresting fathers of
[2:58:13.760 --> 2:58:17.640]  grooming gang victims because apparently that's more important they were doing
[2:58:17.640 --> 2:58:24.000]  nothing the protesters were blocking the road and the protesters both Black and
[2:58:24.000 --> 2:58:30.240]  White were walking in between all the cars as they were stuck you can find
[2:58:30.240 --> 2:58:35.480]  this on my Twitter by the way there is there's a video of the protests near
[2:58:35.480 --> 2:58:39.600]  Westminster there's another one if you scroll right down on my profile there's
[2:58:39.600 --> 2:58:43.640]  a video where there's a US flag in the video and all these protesters and all
[2:58:43.640 --> 2:58:48.040]  these cars that's where I was stuck and the protesters again both Black and
[2:58:48.040 --> 2:58:54.520]  White would go in between the cars glaring at the people in the vehicles to
[2:58:54.520 --> 2:59:00.840]  check the evidence of face crime now what is face crime well it's something that
[2:59:00.840 --> 2:59:07.560]  was enforced by the party in George Orwell's 1984 and it was described as
[2:59:07.560 --> 2:59:12.960]  to wear an improper expression on your face and of course that meant if you
[2:59:12.960 --> 2:59:18.280]  weren't showing enough fealty enough enthusiasm for the party for big brother
[2:59:18.280 --> 2:59:23.640]  enough hatred against Goldstein in terms of the two minutes hate then you were
[2:59:23.640 --> 2:59:28.880]  deemed to be suspect and that's exactly what was happening during this Black
[2:59:28.880 --> 2:59:33.920]  Lives Matter protest down there at the US Embassy so they were glaring at
[2:59:33.920 --> 2:59:37.200]  everybody in the cars the white people in the cars again both Black and White
[2:59:37.200 --> 2:59:42.360]  demonstrators if you didn't show fealty you didn't give a thumbs up if you
[2:59:42.360 --> 2:59:48.640]  didn't beat in support of Black Lives Matter then you were harassed and we
[2:59:48.640 --> 2:59:52.040]  had to roll up the windows because they were trying to get in the windows they
[2:59:52.040 --> 2:59:55.960]  were trying to put flyers in the windows because I had an improper facial
[2:59:55.960 --> 3:00:01.600]  expression because I wasn't supporting their protest literally had a massive
[3:00:01.600 --> 3:00:06.320]  hangover and three hours sleep whoever was there with me stuck in a boiling hot
[3:00:06.320 --> 3:00:09.960]  car for two hours I wasn't gonna be very happy about it but they were banging on
[3:00:09.960 --> 3:00:12.840]  the windows they were harassing people they were trying to put flyers through
[3:00:12.840 --> 3:00:16.480]  the windows and saying you're not showing the proper support you need to
[3:00:16.480 --> 3:00:20.640]  check your white privilege here's a flyer you need to read this so I got a
[3:00:20.640 --> 3:00:25.640]  little taste of that on Sunday there you see the video and I was writing the
[3:00:25.640 --> 3:00:33.400]  globe that and now today that spilled over into Blackout Tuesday which the
[3:00:33.400 --> 3:00:37.080]  guys are talking about there before the break headline out of the Guardian
[3:00:37.080 --> 3:00:41.920]  Blackout Tuesday black squares dominate social media and spark debate as
[3:00:41.920 --> 3:00:46.440]  millions of white girls posting images of black squares on Instagram is surely
[3:00:46.440 --> 3:00:53.000]  gonna end racism right what's even more interesting is that I know people like
[3:00:53.000 --> 3:00:58.400]  Rex was talking about before I know people from my past I don't really
[3:00:58.400 --> 3:01:01.760]  speak to that much anymore but you know still follow them on social media on
[3:01:01.760 --> 3:01:07.240]  Instagram and they know all about Antifa they know all about Black Lives Matter
[3:01:07.240 --> 3:01:12.160]  they know all about this looting this rioting these beatings of innocent
[3:01:12.160 --> 3:01:17.400]  people setting fire to businesses owned by black people they know all about it
[3:01:17.400 --> 3:01:25.200]  but even they have been cow-towed into amplifying this mob message of supporting
[3:01:25.200 --> 3:01:30.760]  Black Lives Matter supporting Antifa with this Blackout Tuesday the protest
[3:01:30.760 --> 3:01:34.040]  movement sparked by the death and police custody of George Floyd and Minneapolis
[3:01:34.040 --> 3:01:37.320]  spread from the music business to social media on Tuesday as major
[3:01:37.320 --> 3:01:40.520]  institutions around the world posted black squares and stopped online
[3:01:40.520 --> 3:01:46.560]  activity in solidarity and again this is also being led by the celebrities some
[3:01:46.560 --> 3:01:51.840]  of whom have donated up to two hundred thousand dollars to get these criminals
[3:01:51.840 --> 3:01:58.000]  these rioters out of jail in fact I'm gonna go on to a story in the next
[3:01:58.000 --> 3:02:02.160]  segment where there's literally a woman crying her eyes out because her sister
[3:02:02.160 --> 3:02:07.800]  was killed by a protester how many celebrities is Seth Rogen gonna donate
[3:02:07.800 --> 3:02:13.240]  to that family the sister was literally shot by another protester and
[3:02:13.240 --> 3:02:18.960]  is now dead as she was leaving a protest in Ohio is she gonna get a single
[3:02:18.960 --> 3:02:22.880]  dollar from these celebrities who are paying up to two hundred thousand
[3:02:22.880 --> 3:02:27.640]  dollars to bail criminals out of jail or any of those businesses owned by
[3:02:27.640 --> 3:02:33.040]  black people gonna get a single dollar from these celebrities who are donating
[3:02:33.040 --> 3:02:37.720]  up to two hundred thousand dollars to bail out rioters and criminals from jail
[3:02:37.720 --> 3:02:43.080]  not so far that I've seen there was a go fund me for the guy who lost his
[3:02:43.080 --> 3:02:47.280]  business back a couple of days ago and went viral but again that was you know
[3:02:47.280 --> 3:02:50.760]  the donations came straight from the people I didn't see any celebrity
[3:02:50.760 --> 3:02:56.280]  supporting that didn't see any major corporation supporting that on that
[3:02:56.280 --> 3:03:01.440]  subject headline Apple freezes browse feature of music app and replaces it
[3:03:01.440 --> 3:03:07.800]  with F the police playlist yes now you can't even choose your own music on the
[3:03:07.800 --> 3:03:13.280]  Apple music app if you go to the browse feature or the radio feature they're
[3:03:13.280 --> 3:03:19.080]  completely inactive today and have been replaced by an F the police playlist you
[3:03:19.080 --> 3:03:23.720]  don't know what F the police is it's a song by NWA and it includes these
[3:03:23.720 --> 3:03:29.200]  lyrics remember this is the Apple corporation endorsing this quote be a
[3:03:29.200 --> 3:03:33.160]  police out of shape and when I'm finished bring the yellow tape to tape off the
[3:03:33.160 --> 3:03:38.400]  scene of the slaughter punk police are afraid of me a young N word on the war
[3:03:38.400 --> 3:03:43.760]  path and when I'm finished it's gonna be a bloodbath of cops dying in LA this
[3:03:43.760 --> 3:03:49.400]  message is endorsed by Apple very mind Apple the same corporation that uses
[3:03:49.400 --> 3:03:53.560]  Chinese slave labor in factories where they literally have to put suicide
[3:03:53.560 --> 3:03:57.560]  nets around the factories because the workers are so abused and want to kill
[3:03:57.560 --> 3:04:03.000]  themselves on a regular basis but yeah they really care about injustice this is
[3:04:03.000 --> 3:04:09.880]  the same corporation that removed an app from their store that was enabling the
[3:04:09.880 --> 3:04:16.640]  Hong Kong protesters to organize in their protests against Chinese communist
[3:04:16.640 --> 3:04:21.240]  government oppression removed the app that helped them organize but they
[3:04:21.240 --> 3:04:27.120]  really care about injustice absolutely incredible now they're controlling what
[3:04:27.120 --> 3:04:33.240]  music you can listen to on their app and again it goes back to you don't fall in
[3:04:33.240 --> 3:04:37.880]  line with the mob virtue signaling is now not enough I'm gonna get on to
[3:04:37.880 --> 3:04:43.120]  another story of a fashion designer who didn't donate enough money the black
[3:04:43.120 --> 3:04:50.000]  lives matter so now he's been publicly shamed so silence if you just don't say
[3:04:50.000 --> 3:04:53.800]  anything about it the mob will come after you anyway if you do say something
[3:04:53.800 --> 3:04:58.240]  about it and if you support it but not vehemently enough the mob will come after
[3:04:58.240 --> 3:05:05.520]  you anyway this is mob rule writ large absolutely incredible and in fact we'll
[3:05:05.520 --> 3:05:10.880]  play after the break but there's a clip from doctor who from about 10 15 years
[3:05:10.880 --> 3:05:15.440]  ago where everybody's receiving the same information on their phones and it's
[3:05:15.440 --> 3:05:20.520]  delisting the same reactions and it's it's parallel with what Apple's doing
[3:05:20.520 --> 3:05:27.120]  today with this feature on their app meanwhile Nickelodeon frightens
[3:05:27.120 --> 3:05:31.000]  children with I can't breathe virtue signal we're gonna play this clip after
[3:05:31.000 --> 3:05:35.240]  the break as well and the woman who posted this clip by the way who is a
[3:05:35.240 --> 3:05:40.440]  Trump supporter it's a video of a promo played on Nickelodeon where they play
[3:05:40.440 --> 3:05:44.840]  this creepy heavy breathing sound and then I can't breathe is a text that's
[3:05:44.840 --> 3:05:49.120]  flashed up to children the kids crying in the background saying he's scared
[3:05:49.120 --> 3:05:53.560]  please turn it off this woman's on the video which was uploaded to Twitter
[3:05:53.560 --> 3:05:59.320]  saying no I just want to see what this message says that went viral overnight I
[3:05:59.320 --> 3:06:04.400]  think it got about three million views about an hour ago she had to delete her
[3:06:04.400 --> 3:06:08.680]  entire Twitter account because again she was getting death threats violent
[3:06:08.680 --> 3:06:14.680]  threats intimidation from the mall if you don't support their message they
[3:06:14.680 --> 3:06:19.800]  will come after you like never before gonna get into that and more and also
[3:06:19.800 --> 3:06:23.600]  talk about the origins of the Black Lives Matter movement because of course
[3:06:23.600 --> 3:06:28.400]  CNN still tells us that they're all peaceful loving tolerant people yet if
[3:06:28.400 --> 3:06:32.920]  you look at who their inspirational guru is suggests as something very
[3:06:32.920 --> 3:06:36.520]  different we'll get into that and more on the other side summit.news don't go
[3:06:36.520 --> 3:06:40.680]  away it took hundreds and hundreds of years of human civilization to build
[3:06:40.680 --> 3:06:45.920]  up the world economy to where it is every economist is on record saying that
[3:06:45.920 --> 3:06:50.480]  as this economy has been shut down for two months it is going to be a death
[3:06:50.480 --> 3:06:54.600]  sentence to the third world and a horrible nightmarish collapse for the
[3:06:54.600 --> 3:06:58.560]  first world and that the general public is going to go into deep deep debt to
[3:06:58.560 --> 3:07:03.080]  the mega banks but I'm gonna have medical ID cards forced inoculations we
[3:07:03.080 --> 3:07:09.440]  are now in a giant dystopia but a lot of people are waking up and there is a
[3:07:09.440 --> 3:07:15.000]  major backlash taking place against this tyranny and we must all rediscover our
[3:07:15.000 --> 3:07:19.000]  bill of rights rediscover our constitution and our backbone and start
[3:07:19.000 --> 3:07:23.400]  saying no to people who take this moral high ground and say shut your business
[3:07:23.400 --> 3:07:28.120]  down shut your life down it'll save lives no it's caused millions already

[3:08:33.480 --> 3:08:37.640]  available at infowarstore.com
[3:08:39.160 --> 3:08:44.640]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:08:44.640 --> 3:09:02.560]  so virtue signaling has evolved from people echoing social justice dogma for
[3:09:02.560 --> 3:09:07.040]  brownie puns to people echoing social justice dogma because they're so
[3:09:07.040 --> 3:09:11.840]  terrified of their friends their colleagues attacking them but not
[3:09:11.840 --> 3:09:17.520]  loudly proclaiming that they share the same opinion as everyone else this
[3:09:17.520 --> 3:09:22.240]  enforcement of uniformity of thinking is perhaps one of the most chilling things
[3:09:22.240 --> 3:09:27.720]  to come out the past few days because below the rioting looting and rampant
[3:09:27.720 --> 3:09:32.120]  violence that we've seen across America we also have transnational
[3:09:32.120 --> 3:09:36.720]  entertainment corporations currently prostrating themselves to support
[3:09:36.720 --> 3:09:43.040]  protests in America they were noticeably silent weren't they when protesters
[3:09:43.040 --> 3:09:46.880]  were demonstrating against Chinese communist oppression in Hong Kong and
[3:09:46.880 --> 3:09:52.800]  in fact many large corporations like the NBA openly supported China during that
[3:09:52.800 --> 3:09:58.160]  vicious oppression of protesters in Hong Kong almost like the billions they
[3:09:58.160 --> 3:10:03.360]  make from China is more important than supporting justice and we see another
[3:10:03.360 --> 3:10:09.040]  example of that today with Apple which again uses slave labor in China where at
[3:10:09.040 --> 3:10:12.240]  the factories they literally have to have suicide nets around the entire
[3:10:12.240 --> 3:10:16.800]  complex because people try to kill themselves on a regular basis but they
[3:10:16.800 --> 3:10:21.840]  care about justice now they've literally hijacked people's phones
[3:10:21.840 --> 3:10:24.960]  apple has frozen the browse feature on its music app and replaced it with a
[3:10:24.960 --> 3:10:28.720]  playlist that includes the song f the police which is about killing police
[3:10:28.720 --> 3:10:32.720]  officers in case you didn't know the stunt is part of blackout Tuesday with
[3:10:32.720 --> 3:10:36.720]  celebrities and corporations bombarding social media with messages blacked out
[3:10:36.720 --> 3:10:41.040]  squares about how much they support the violent riots I mean protests taking
[3:10:41.040 --> 3:10:45.920]  place across America it's funny though now because within about three hours of
[3:10:45.920 --> 3:10:50.800]  this blackout Tuesday trending they turned on each other once again and said
[3:10:50.800 --> 3:10:53.840]  well no putting a black square on Instagram isn't really going to do much
[3:10:53.840 --> 3:10:58.640]  to address racial inequality so now those people are being attacked for doing
[3:10:58.640 --> 3:11:02.320]  that when a user tries to access the browse feature on the app they are met
[3:11:02.320 --> 3:11:06.080]  with a message that says instead fat support steadfast support the black
[3:11:06.080 --> 3:11:10.400]  voices that define music creativity and culture we use ours I checked it on my
[3:11:10.400 --> 3:11:14.400]  own phone you can check it for yourself and one of the playlist tracks is f
[3:11:14.400 --> 3:11:17.520]  the police which is about killing cops
[3:11:17.520 --> 3:11:21.360]  faith goldy tweeted so apple music won't let me listen to my own music
[3:11:21.360 --> 3:11:25.200]  while I remain quarantined against my will it's forcing me to listen to rap
[3:11:25.200 --> 3:11:28.880]  music about burning down american cities
[3:11:28.880 --> 3:11:32.240]  then you have Nickelodeon which has also jumped on board with this
[3:11:32.240 --> 3:11:35.440]  massive corporate virtue signal because suddenly they really care about
[3:11:35.440 --> 3:11:38.640]  justice the video clip shows a frightened child
[3:11:38.640 --> 3:11:41.920]  asking his mother to turn off a Nickelodeon promo
[3:11:41.920 --> 3:11:45.600]  which features the sound of heavy breathing in the words I can't breathe
[3:11:45.600 --> 3:11:49.200]  as a corporate virtue signal to recognize the death of George Floyd and we
[3:11:49.200 --> 3:12:01.840]  have that clip let's play it now
[3:12:01.840 --> 3:12:06.480]  I will I just want to see what's happening here
[3:12:06.480 --> 3:12:12.400]  don't be scared don't be scared
[3:12:13.200 --> 3:12:16.800]  okay I will change it okay so there you have
[3:12:16.800 --> 3:12:20.560]  children being frightened and brainwashed with this message that black
[3:12:20.560 --> 3:12:24.640]  people are being indiscriminately targeted for death by cops which I'm
[3:12:24.640 --> 3:12:27.840]  going to get into the next segment is completely not true
[3:12:27.840 --> 3:12:32.000]  the very basis of these entire process is completely erroneous
[3:12:32.000 --> 3:12:36.160]  but after the clip went viral that you just heard the mother was completely
[3:12:36.160 --> 3:12:39.360]  ripped apart by a hateful mob of respondents on twitter because of
[3:12:39.360 --> 3:12:43.040]  course she was in fact Nickelodeon was trending
[3:12:43.040 --> 3:12:46.000]  the words that she used in this tweet were trending
[3:12:46.000 --> 3:12:49.680]  got about two million views on the video and she deleted her entire twitter
[3:12:49.680 --> 3:12:53.200]  account because no doubt she was getting violent death threats
[3:12:53.200 --> 3:12:58.720]  in the messages in fact I remember I did a viral video about the
[3:12:58.720 --> 3:13:02.640]  Pittsburgh riots I think it was back in 2016
[3:13:02.640 --> 3:13:07.680]  which got about 19 million views on facebook woke up the next day to about
[3:13:07.680 --> 3:13:12.080]  three dozen direct death threats because these people are very tolerant
[3:13:12.080 --> 3:13:17.760]  very loving hashtag be kind and of course apple
[3:13:17.760 --> 3:13:21.680]  changing your phone so you can't use the radio function or the browse function
[3:13:21.680 --> 3:13:27.280]  you have to listen to this pro BLM playlist very reminiscent of a doctor
[3:13:27.280 --> 3:13:30.320]  who episode which somebody flagged up to me earlier which was
[3:13:30.320 --> 3:13:33.760]  broadcast about 10 years ago we also have that clip and we're
[3:13:33.760 --> 3:13:36.480]  going to roll it right now here it is
[3:13:36.480 --> 3:13:42.880]  like I said parallel world gingerbread house we need to get out of here as fast as we can
[3:13:42.880 --> 3:14:09.680]  what they all do
[3:14:09.680 --> 3:14:13.920]  is the ear pieces
[3:14:13.920 --> 3:14:19.760]  like bluetooth attachments but everyone's connected together
[3:14:19.760 --> 3:14:23.600]  it's on my phone it's automatic look it's downloading
[3:14:23.600 --> 3:14:28.320]  just what we all get
[3:14:28.320 --> 3:14:35.120]  news international news sports weather they get it direct
[3:14:35.120 --> 3:14:40.400]  downloaded right into their heads tv schedules lottery numbers
[3:14:40.400 --> 3:14:45.840]  everyone shares the same information the daily download published by
[3:14:45.840 --> 3:14:56.320]  cybers industry
[3:14:56.320 --> 3:14:59.040]  you lot you're obsessed with either the latest upgrade
[3:14:59.040 --> 3:15:03.440]  right not my lot different world remember not so far off your world this place
[3:15:03.440 --> 3:15:08.480]  is only parallel so a dystopian alternate reality
[3:15:08.480 --> 3:15:11.840]  where the uniformity of people's opinions are enforced by
[3:15:11.840 --> 3:15:16.160]  mob intimidation as i've just talked about and automatic downloads to your
[3:15:16.160 --> 3:15:21.280]  phone by giant corporations so glad that that isn't happening to us
[3:15:21.280 --> 3:15:25.440]  oh it is headline despite corporate virtue signaling
[3:15:25.440 --> 3:15:29.360]  nike and amazon both targeted by rioters now
[3:15:29.360 --> 3:15:33.760]  yesterday or a few days ago i believe it was nike got on the board
[3:15:33.760 --> 3:15:36.560]  what early they got on the bandwagon early with this corporate virtue
[3:15:36.560 --> 3:15:40.480]  signaling again nike of you know third world sweatshop fame
[3:15:40.480 --> 3:15:44.960]  they care about injustice tweeted a video in which the company urged people
[3:15:44.960 --> 3:15:48.480]  don't turn your back on racism don't pretend there's not a problem in america
[3:15:48.480 --> 3:15:52.640]  unless you're paying children slave wages in the third world then it's fine
[3:15:52.640 --> 3:16:00.000]  be part of the change then amazon also echo echoed that by tweeting this the
[3:16:00.000 --> 3:16:03.200]  inequitable brute treatment of black people in our country must stop
[3:16:03.200 --> 3:16:06.880]  do together we stand in solidarity with the black community
[3:16:06.880 --> 3:16:10.880]  nike stores all over america are being looted as you can see right here so that
[3:16:10.880 --> 3:16:16.960]  didn't really work did it and then amazon pledged their support for the rioters
[3:16:16.960 --> 3:16:21.200]  even as their own employees were being targeted by the mob and in this article
[3:16:21.200 --> 3:16:25.600]  you can see video footage out of santa monica california shows an amazon truck
[3:16:25.600 --> 3:16:29.520]  being ransacked by a group of what the media will no doubt describe as
[3:16:29.520 --> 3:16:32.720]  white nationalists because of course that's the narrative they're running
[3:16:32.720 --> 3:16:36.320]  with you can see the mob looting the amazon delivery truck and knocking
[3:16:36.320 --> 3:16:39.600]  what looks like an old white lady to the ground while ripping the purse out of
[3:16:39.600 --> 3:16:43.440]  her hands in this video again a vicious attack by white
[3:16:43.440 --> 3:16:48.000]  nationalists so didn't work for nike didn't work for amazon their
[3:16:48.000 --> 3:16:52.640]  stores are getting looted their employees are getting attacked
[3:16:52.640 --> 3:16:56.080]  don't reckon nike really gives the damn about that though because of course
[3:16:56.080 --> 3:16:59.440]  they sponsored calling cappernick who started the whole
[3:16:59.440 --> 3:17:04.960]  take a knee movement and from that 2018 add in which cappernick asserted
[3:17:04.960 --> 3:17:08.640]  believe in something even if it means sacrificing everything just do it
[3:17:08.640 --> 3:17:14.160]  they made six billion dollars so is it really worth a few stores getting
[3:17:14.160 --> 3:17:18.160]  ransacked the loss of some stock that six million dollar corporate virtue signal
[3:17:18.160 --> 3:17:22.320]  six billion dollar corporate virtue signal you bet it is
[3:17:22.320 --> 3:17:25.920]  absolutely incredible we're gonna come back and talk about
[3:17:25.920 --> 3:17:30.000]  the sister the woman whose sister was shot dead at a black lives matter
[3:17:30.000 --> 3:17:34.800]  protest is getting uh next to zero media attention as you would expect
[3:17:34.800 --> 3:17:38.320]  we'll be back i was talking to my wife tonight and i was saying
[3:17:38.320 --> 3:17:41.680]  our economy slowing down and shutting down is like shooting
[3:17:41.680 --> 3:17:45.200]  a deer and it runs a hundred yards before it knows it's been shot and then it
[3:17:45.200 --> 3:17:48.560]  finally dies she said well yeah when i grew up in
[3:17:48.560 --> 3:17:51.680]  Omaha nebraska one time there was an argument in the street
[3:17:51.680 --> 3:17:55.440]  and another man shot another man in the head and the man that got shot in the
[3:17:55.440 --> 3:17:59.680]  head had blood pouring out a huge hole he was holding it he walked around
[3:17:59.680 --> 3:18:02.800]  gibbering talking nonsense for about 60 seconds
[3:18:02.800 --> 3:18:07.120]  and then just fell over dead well that's what's gonna happen with our economy
[3:18:07.120 --> 3:18:12.400]  it is in cardiac arrest this has been done by design and the un the chai coms
[3:18:12.400 --> 3:18:16.560]  the mainstream media orchestrated it hyped it and tried to keep the economy
[3:18:16.560 --> 3:18:19.920]  closed so remember the depression that's coming and
[3:18:19.920 --> 3:18:23.360]  the third world collapse is all on the un on bill

[3:21:18.480 --> 3:21:23.440]  one that was demanded by the mob and then she also posted three white squares
[3:21:23.440 --> 3:21:26.800]  on her instagram page so it wouldn't ruin the aesthetic
[3:21:26.800 --> 3:21:30.800]  now emma watson is being publicly humiliated and cancelled

[3:22:01.760 --> 3:22:05.360]  six p.m i presume it'd be more silent than the
[3:22:05.360 --> 3:22:08.880]  applause and the fireworks and the bank pipes that we've seen for the nhs but
[3:22:08.880 --> 3:22:13.200]  i'm sure after they take a knee for george floyd
[3:22:13.200 --> 3:22:17.200]  they will be applauding themselves afterwards and posting it on social
[3:22:17.200 --> 3:22:22.640]  media because they're such good allies speaking of that video
[3:22:22.640 --> 3:22:27.200]  woman kneels on demand in the street to apologize for her white privilege
[3:22:27.200 --> 3:22:30.560]  the video clip shows a woman immediately obeying a black man's request to kneel on
[3:22:30.560 --> 3:22:32.960]  her feet in the street and apologize for her white privilege
[3:22:32.960 --> 3:22:36.800]  i think we've got the clip let's play it now i'll speak over it it's fine
[3:22:36.800 --> 3:22:41.200]  so basically he's pointing at her he's giving her like hand gestures like he's
[3:22:41.200 --> 3:22:45.200]  training a dog to roll over runs up to her on the street
[3:22:45.200 --> 3:22:50.000]  i think he's probably trolling because he says i work for black lives matter
[3:22:50.000 --> 3:22:53.520]  and that the ceo of the company has told him to come out
[3:22:53.520 --> 3:22:57.600]  tell white people to get on their knees so whether he's trolling or not is not
[3:22:57.600 --> 3:23:01.280]  the issue the issue is her reaction she immediately
[3:23:01.280 --> 3:23:05.120]  gets down on her knees and uh prostrates herself
[3:23:05.120 --> 3:23:09.040]  genuflex to this powerful black lives matter activist
[3:23:09.040 --> 3:23:12.400]  and apologizes for her white privilege although
[3:23:12.400 --> 3:23:15.760]  you know with this beginning of the encounter she seemed quite afraid of the
[3:23:15.760 --> 3:23:19.040]  black man a little bit of racism shining right through there
[3:23:19.040 --> 3:23:23.200]  so we have that going on we have cops across america
[3:23:23.200 --> 3:23:27.280]  literally taking a knee as their cities are burned and looted to the ground
[3:23:27.280 --> 3:23:31.680]  we love our law enforcement officers and we have this headliner of new york
[3:23:31.680 --> 3:23:36.640]  post luxury designer virgil abloh slammed for donating a measly
[3:23:36.640 --> 3:23:42.080]  $50 to protesters bail fund so because he only gave only gave $50
[3:23:42.080 --> 3:23:46.720]  to bail out criminals and looters that beat people up in the streets viciously
[3:23:46.720 --> 3:23:51.360]  now he's being publicly humiliated protesters ignited by the death of

[3:23:56.080 --> 3:24:00.160]  for being cheap into pouring their cause he's the artistic director of louis

[3:24:03.200 --> 3:24:08.000]  that he had donated $50 to protesters in need of bail money
[3:24:08.000 --> 3:24:11.680]  and after that or before that he'd made some other comments on his instagram
[3:24:11.680 --> 3:24:15.440]  which got him in some hot water again he wasn't showing enough
[3:24:15.440 --> 3:24:19.040]  vehement praise was a prostrating himself enough
[3:24:19.040 --> 3:24:23.120]  he's black by the way two black lives matter protesters
[3:24:23.120 --> 3:24:26.560]  he donates cash to bail out literal criminals
[3:24:26.560 --> 3:24:30.480]  but it's not enough so now he's being publicly humiliated
[3:24:30.480 --> 3:24:37.280]  and shamed meanwhile speaking of cash box 11 los angeles reports

[3:24:47.440 --> 3:24:52.000]  by his group police were able to catch him and he was taken into custody
[3:24:52.000 --> 3:24:55.760]  this is in minnesota i think

[3:25:08.000 --> 3:25:11.280]  no i'll let you listen to his explanation

[3:31:26.400 --> 3:31:29.200]  supporting you and your family with amazing products that are so good for
[3:31:29.200 --> 3:31:32.080]  you and your body again thank you all for your support we are all in this
[3:31:32.080 --> 3:31:36.640]  together i've hunted a lot of big game at long
[3:31:36.640 --> 3:31:40.560]  distances with high caliber rifles and when you shoot an elk
[3:31:40.560 --> 3:31:44.320]  could say 600 yards even if you hit them right in the heart
[3:31:44.320 --> 3:31:49.040]  they'll still run 50 60 70 maybe a hundred yards
[3:31:49.040 --> 3:31:53.280]  they've got that adrenaline pumping through their arteries and through their
[3:31:53.280 --> 3:31:55.600]  veins but all of a sudden they slow down
[3:31:55.600 --> 3:31:59.520]  they realize what's happened they fall over and they die
[3:31:59.520 --> 3:32:03.920]  then you go bag them and haul them back in well that's what's going to happen
[3:32:03.920 --> 3:32:07.760]  to the entire world now and that's what the economic numbers
[3:32:07.760 --> 3:32:12.000]  show is that we've been shot right in the heart
[3:32:12.000 --> 3:32:15.440]  and for the first world it's going to mean a long horrible depression
[3:32:15.440 --> 3:32:19.040]  and a lot of death well for the third world it's going to mean probably over
[3:32:19.040 --> 3:32:21.920]  a hundred million dead according to the UN and i believe their numbers
[3:32:21.920 --> 3:32:25.760]  because it's the very UN that's orchestrated this to depopulate the
[3:32:25.760 --> 3:32:28.240]  third world so to all the leftists that thought it was their
[3:32:28.240 --> 3:32:31.520]  revolution to get rid of Trump you're a bunch of suckers and you bought into
[3:32:31.520 --> 3:32:35.360]  something better than what Hitler did
[3:32:35.360 --> 3:32:40.000]  feudalism in the ancient world from Asia to Europe from Africa to Latin America
[3:32:40.000 --> 3:32:43.920]  was the most common form of government you had a ruling class
[3:32:43.920 --> 3:32:47.040]  the nobility the king and queen sitting on top of it
[3:32:47.040 --> 3:32:50.000]  and the rest of the public were kept at a subsistence
[3:32:50.000 --> 3:32:55.520]  starving level for control in fact in most cultures they call the peasants
[3:32:55.520 --> 3:32:59.600]  the little people because they were usually a foot or more shorter
[3:32:59.600 --> 3:33:03.040]  than the lords and ladies because they kept them again
[3:33:03.040 --> 3:33:06.880]  at a starving level they were so busy trying to survive
[3:33:06.880 --> 3:33:09.600]  they would never try to challenge the entrenched elite
[3:33:09.600 --> 3:33:13.840]  well now all the big google owners and the rocofellers and the Rothschilds
[3:33:13.840 --> 3:33:17.200]  the jeff bezos is the world they're sitting back on their giant estates
[3:33:17.200 --> 3:33:21.920]  with their jet helicopters and private jets living the life
[3:33:21.920 --> 3:33:26.880]  laughing at you shut down going bankrupt in the third world starving to death
[3:33:26.880 --> 3:33:30.720]  their religion is power and control and they are
[3:33:30.720 --> 3:33:37.120]  pressing that advantage against us we must break free from these monsters
[3:33:37.120 --> 3:33:40.960]  we're living in insanely dangerous times and i've told folks
[3:33:40.960 --> 3:33:44.320]  going back three months ago i'm not buying storable food because i'm worried
[3:33:44.320 --> 3:33:47.120]  about the covid-19 virus i'm worried about the food shortages
[3:33:47.120 --> 3:33:51.120]  and the economic collapse and now it's admitted that a chain reaction has begun
[3:33:51.120 --> 3:33:54.640]  that's already caused food shortages and the collapse of farms and ranches
[3:33:54.640 --> 3:33:57.920]  across the united states and it's even worse in the third world so i hope
[3:33:57.920 --> 3:34:01.200]  trump with his initiatives can clean this up and fix it but with the election
[3:34:01.200 --> 3:34:04.560]  fraud and the covid-19 all the wars and the third
[3:34:04.560 --> 3:34:06.720]  world collapsing and everything else is going on
[3:34:06.720 --> 3:34:10.880]  now is the time to get storeable foods because they'll last for 25 years
[3:34:10.880 --> 3:34:14.560]  they're in easily totable bags it's high quality food and it's good to have
[3:34:14.560 --> 3:34:17.680]  that box checked off to be ready and it funds the info war so we have

[3:36:09.600 --> 3:36:14.400]  percent off flash sale go there today
[3:36:14.400 --> 3:36:19.360]  now the entire basis of this rioting this looting these vicious attacks on
[3:36:19.360 --> 3:36:22.480]  innocent people to claim that black people are
[3:36:22.480 --> 3:36:26.000]  indiscriminately disproportionately targeted
[3:36:26.000 --> 3:36:29.840]  in killings by white police officers is of course complete
[3:36:29.840 --> 3:36:35.360]  bonk it was bonk during the Ferguson riots it was bonk during the Pittsburgh riots
[3:36:35.360 --> 3:36:39.760]  and it's still bonk to this day Lanidas Johnson
[3:36:39.760 --> 3:36:44.160]  and I tweeted this earlier retweeted it who is black by the way
[3:36:44.160 --> 3:36:47.760]  got all the stats from the FBI crime statistics we've shown them many times
[3:36:47.760 --> 3:36:52.960]  before but he compiled them once again he tweeted this for every 10 000
[3:36:52.960 --> 3:36:57.600]  black people arrested for violent crime three are killed for every 10 000
[3:36:57.600 --> 3:37:01.600]  white people arrested for violent crime four are killed
[3:37:01.600 --> 3:37:04.400]  and then idiots in the thread were saying oh but there's many more white
[3:37:04.400 --> 3:37:06.480]  people in american the black people know it's
[3:37:06.480 --> 3:37:10.800]  equal measures 10 000 black people 10 000 white people
[3:37:10.800 --> 3:37:14.480]  arrested for violent crime the figures show from the FBI
[3:37:14.480 --> 3:37:17.280]  three are killed in the case of black people four are killed in the case of
[3:37:17.280 --> 3:37:21.200]  white people so again completely undermines the entire
[3:37:21.200 --> 3:37:25.680]  basis of this protest they see his tweet right there
[3:37:25.680 --> 3:37:29.440]  Brandon Tate and tweeted today he's also black by the way
[3:37:29.440 --> 3:37:33.200]  there's about 44 million african-americans in this country
[3:37:33.200 --> 3:37:39.440]  last year 245 were killed by cops nine were unarmed if my math is correct
[3:37:39.440 --> 3:37:46.000]  that's 0.0000006% literally what are you all doing at
[3:37:46.000 --> 3:37:50.400]  this point John Miller tweeted he's also black
[3:37:50.400 --> 3:37:53.440]  anyone going to talk about how police shoot and kill twice as many white
[3:37:53.440 --> 3:37:55.840]  people as black people does that ruin the whole
[3:37:55.840 --> 3:38:00.480]  oh lord we are being hunted narrative and of course
[3:38:00.480 --> 3:38:03.440]  stats put out by us news and world report using
[3:38:03.440 --> 3:38:08.880]  fbi data show that interracial killings whites killed by blacks is at least
[3:38:08.880 --> 3:38:14.000]  double blacks killed by whites and has been for the past 15 years but
[3:38:14.000 --> 3:38:18.240]  again hate facts don't matter when the truth is determined
[3:38:18.240 --> 3:38:21.520]  by a mob which intimidates people into having
[3:38:21.520 --> 3:38:26.880]  uniformity of opinion the facts don't matter the objective truth doesn't
[3:38:26.880 --> 3:38:30.400]  matter it's what you are intimidated into not only
[3:38:30.400 --> 3:38:34.560]  believing at accepting but as we've seen with this blackout Tuesday trend
[3:38:34.560 --> 3:38:39.200]  also amplifying if you don't amplify it then you're part of the problem
[3:38:39.200 --> 3:38:44.880]  meanwhile five years ago i wrote this article which is
[3:38:44.880 --> 3:38:48.400]  basically impossible to find now because google broke its own search engine to
[3:38:48.400 --> 3:38:52.240]  censor us headline inspiration behind black lives
[3:38:52.240 --> 3:38:56.240]  matter is on the fbi's most wanted terrorist list yes
[3:38:56.240 --> 3:39:01.760]  the literal spiritual guru cited by the founders of black lives matter
[3:39:01.760 --> 3:39:05.600]  is literally a cop killing domestic terrorist on the run
[3:39:05.600 --> 3:39:09.360]  oh but it's a peaceful movement the inspiration behind black lives matter
[3:39:09.360 --> 3:39:13.120]  movement the individual cited by its founder regularly quoted by its
[3:39:13.120 --> 3:39:16.480]  supporters is a convicted cop killer who's on
[3:39:16.480 --> 3:39:21.200]  the fbi's most wanted terrorist list as far as i know still is
[3:39:21.200 --> 3:39:24.720]  black lives matter was founded by militant feminist
[3:39:24.720 --> 3:39:28.480]  alicia gaza patrice collars and opel tometi
[3:39:28.480 --> 3:39:33.120]  the gaza widely recognized as the most influential of the three
[3:39:33.120 --> 3:39:36.080]  in an article which details the philosophical foundation of black lives
[3:39:36.080 --> 3:39:40.560]  matter gaza cites quote assaata's powerful demand in my
[3:39:40.560 --> 3:39:45.280]  organizing work who is she talking about she's talking about assaata Shakur
[3:39:45.280 --> 3:39:49.280]  otherwise known as joanne deborah chessy mod a radical feminist and marxist
[3:39:49.280 --> 3:39:53.520]  revolutionary who escaped from prison in 1979 while
[3:39:53.520 --> 3:39:57.200]  serving a life sentence for the murder of new jersey state trooper
[3:39:57.200 --> 3:40:01.280]  werner forster that's right on may second
[3:40:01.280 --> 3:40:07.200]  1973 along with two other accomplices she killed forster execution style at
[3:40:07.200 --> 3:40:10.640]  point blank range during a routine traffic stop again
[3:40:10.640 --> 3:40:15.680]  this is the spiritual founder of black lives matter
[3:40:15.680 --> 3:40:18.880]  the shakur the shooting was culmination of years of militant radicalism during
[3:40:18.880 --> 3:40:22.160]  which she joined and left the black panther party because it was not
[3:40:22.160 --> 3:40:26.080]  violent enough and then the rest of the article goes through
[3:40:26.080 --> 3:40:30.080]  numerous other examples of her militant violence
[3:40:30.080 --> 3:40:33.600]  why she's on the run why she's in exile in cuba
[3:40:33.600 --> 3:40:38.720]  and why last time i checked at least she's still on the fbi's most wanted
[3:40:38.720 --> 3:40:43.120]  terrorist list but plm it's a peaceful organization
[3:40:43.120 --> 3:40:50.000]  of course during the 2014 to 2016 era there you see her most wanted page on
[3:40:50.000 --> 3:40:54.480]  the fbi's terrorist list website but it's a peaceful movement
[3:40:54.480 --> 3:40:57.680]  during that whole era before trump was elected in the two years before trump
[3:40:57.680 --> 3:41:00.960]  elected we saw much the same scenes as we're seeing now
[3:41:00.960 --> 3:41:04.800]  maybe we didn't see them in as many cities because you remember the ferguson
[3:41:04.800 --> 3:41:10.240]  riots the baltimore riots the pittsburgh riots during those riots
[3:41:10.240 --> 3:41:13.360]  blm protesters marched down the street in one case
[3:41:13.360 --> 3:41:17.200]  in new york enchanted what do we want dead cops
[3:41:17.200 --> 3:41:21.200]  when do we want it now but again it's a peaceful movement
[3:41:21.200 --> 3:41:26.080]  and as i document in this article last december this is talking about december
[3:41:26.080 --> 3:41:31.280]  2014 ishmael brinsley you probably remember this one shot two nypd
[3:41:31.280 --> 3:41:35.360]  officers in the head as part of a quote revenge attack
[3:41:35.360 --> 3:41:39.600]  for the death of michael brown but these are literally terrorist attacks done in
[3:41:39.600 --> 3:41:43.760]  the name of black lives matter does that mean the entirety of black lives
[3:41:43.760 --> 3:41:46.720]  matter is terrorist no that's never been the argument
[3:41:46.720 --> 3:41:52.000]  but at its core it has a violent ethos and its spiritual guru it's literally a
[3:41:52.000 --> 3:41:57.600]  cop killing terrorist in june again this is 2015
[3:41:57.600 --> 3:42:01.120]  two black lives matter supports admitted to masterminding a plot to blow up a
[3:42:01.120 --> 3:42:04.720]  police station and kill numerous cops in ferguson Missouri
[3:42:04.720 --> 3:42:08.240]  again in an effort to avenge the death of michael brown
[3:42:08.240 --> 3:42:11.440]  armed black panthers also called for the murder of police officers during an
[3:42:11.440 --> 3:42:15.040]  open carry march the south by southwest festival in march
[3:42:15.040 --> 3:42:19.920]  2015 chanting the only good pig is a pig that's dead but again this is a
[3:42:19.920 --> 3:42:23.440]  peaceful movement you of course probably remember the
[3:42:23.440 --> 3:42:27.840]  horrific on-air shooting of those two news reporters
[3:42:27.840 --> 3:42:32.000]  alison parker and adam ward by a gunman called brice williams that occurred
[3:42:32.000 --> 3:42:35.520]  back in 2015 why did he shoot them well in his
[3:42:35.520 --> 3:42:40.720]  own words to inflame a race war and as i document in this article
[3:42:40.720 --> 3:42:45.360]  both the nypd killings and the deaths of parker ward were celebrated by
[3:42:45.360 --> 3:42:51.040]  supporters of black lives matter then you fast forward to 2016 of course
[3:42:51.040 --> 3:42:56.320]  right before the election year election season really got into high
[3:42:56.320 --> 3:43:00.240]  gear we had the killings of police officers in
[3:43:00.240 --> 3:43:05.280]  dallas headline police chief suspect upset about black lives matter
[3:43:05.280 --> 3:43:09.680]  wanted to quote kill white people this was the guy
[3:43:09.680 --> 3:43:13.680]  who killed five dallas police officers back
[3:43:13.680 --> 3:43:18.960]  in july 2016 you probably remember the horrific scenes during that time well
[3:43:18.960 --> 3:43:22.320]  dallas police chief david brandt said the prime suspect behind the sniper
[3:43:22.320 --> 3:43:26.080]  attack on police was a black lives matter sympathizer who quote
[3:43:26.080 --> 3:43:29.440]  wanted to kill white people this is what he said
[3:43:29.440 --> 3:43:32.960]  quote the suspect said he was upset about black lives matter he said he was
[3:43:32.960 --> 3:43:36.400]  upset about the recent police shootings so we have
[3:43:36.400 --> 3:43:40.240]  numerous examples of black lives matter supporters
[3:43:40.240 --> 3:43:44.400]  literally carrying out terrorist attacks calling for dead cops
[3:43:44.400 --> 3:43:48.480]  killing cops including that horrific event in dallas and as you see from last
[3:43:48.480 --> 3:43:53.200]  night this video several examples three that i linked to
[3:43:53.200 --> 3:43:58.640]  just in the one article of quote protesters literally running over
[3:43:58.640 --> 3:44:01.920]  cops making their bodies horrifically contort and
[3:44:01.920 --> 3:44:05.040]  fly up into the air another police officer in this instance
[3:44:05.040 --> 3:44:09.440]  being beaten by two protesters on the streets but again
[3:44:09.440 --> 3:44:12.720]  it's a peaceful movement
[3:44:12.720 --> 3:44:17.200]  meanwhile new york cops enforce social distancing despite riots just two miles
[3:44:17.200 --> 3:44:21.600]  away which reminds me in the uk last week we had an entire week's news cycle
[3:44:21.600 --> 3:44:24.400]  of the media whining about one government advisor
[3:44:24.400 --> 3:44:28.400]  because he broke social distancing rules to provide urgent care for his child by
[3:44:28.400 --> 3:44:33.200]  driving up north few days later literally thousands of
[3:44:33.200 --> 3:44:36.560]  blm and tifa protesters congregate in london
[3:44:36.560 --> 3:44:40.800]  suddenly all concerns about social distancing remember they said to the
[3:44:40.800 --> 3:44:43.600]  anti-lockdown protesters in america that they were
[3:44:43.600 --> 3:44:47.840]  literally killing granny by going out on the streets and protesting
[3:44:47.840 --> 3:44:52.400]  when thousands of people riot and loo concerns about social distancing
[3:44:52.400 --> 3:44:56.640]  have suddenly been dropped haven't they meanwhile last vegas cop on life
[3:44:56.640 --> 3:44:59.200]  support after being shot in the head by rioter
[3:44:59.200 --> 3:45:02.320]  that's not getting very much news attention there were also four cops
[3:45:02.320 --> 3:45:05.680]  shot in uh something with saint louis last night
[3:45:05.680 --> 3:45:09.600]  they're still in hospital thankfully it looks like they will survive
[3:45:09.600 --> 3:45:14.000]  meanwhile some good news paul finds clear majority of americans want military
[3:45:14.000 --> 3:45:18.320]  to help police deal with riots and even a majority of democrats want that
[3:45:18.320 --> 3:45:22.160]  so again the silent majority is maybe now having its voice
[3:45:22.160 --> 3:45:40.640]  that's going to wrap it up warren current next
