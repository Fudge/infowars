[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:29.120]  Texas Alex Jones welcome ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us in
[00:29.120 --> 00:36.960]  news Friday the 26th day of March 2010 you have found the temple spirit in the
[00:36.960 --> 00:43.880]  info the front lines in the fight to awaken the population of the world to
[00:43.880 --> 00:52.240]  the growing tyranny enveloping our society every day I'm now just wallowing
[00:52.240 --> 00:57.640]  in incredible news not even knowing what I want to cover first we're gonna get
[00:57.640 --> 01:03.200]  into Barack Obama mocking Republicans Armageddon rhetoric and this is one of
[01:03.200 --> 01:07.040]  their talking points they've been putting out for the last month okay let's
[01:07.040 --> 01:12.360]  see if the economy goes into depression a day after we pass the pill let's see if
[01:12.360 --> 01:17.960]  it bankrupts doctors and hospitals a day after we sign the bill let's see if it
[01:17.960 --> 01:25.680]  hurts our society when it doesn't even get phased in until later this year and
[01:25.680 --> 01:29.520]  that's just the taxation on the American people and then most of the supposed
[01:29.520 --> 01:33.320]  health care doesn't even go into place and all these regulations and taxes
[01:33.320 --> 01:44.240]  until 2013 2015 2018 and so you have a public that's been taught about instant
[01:44.240 --> 01:48.520]  gratification they want instant solutions or they want to see instant
[01:48.520 --> 01:55.160]  problems or they say nothing exists so this is the amazing mind control going
[01:55.160 --> 01:59.680]  on by these people meanwhile Obama said you would have your same insurance and
[01:59.680 --> 02:03.400]  your same doctor that has been proven as a manifest lie it is admitted that
[02:03.400 --> 02:08.040]  children are not given coverage with pre-existing conditions you are not
[02:08.040 --> 02:11.880]  getting free health care they're cutting Medicare and Medicaid while pushing
[02:11.880 --> 02:16.960]  tens of millions of more people onto the program you heard me right 40 plus
[02:16.960 --> 02:24.120]  billion dollars to begin with in cuts every year massive tax increases
[02:24.600 --> 02:28.520]  meanwhile the New York Times is reporting what we already knew but now
[02:28.520 --> 02:33.200]  it's admitted by the government that this year social security will bring in
[02:33.200 --> 02:38.160]  less than it pays out as the baby boomers retire and that's what Obama
[02:38.160 --> 02:41.680]  care is all about it's about lowering the standards of care and what you can
[02:41.680 --> 02:46.240]  get access to even if you pay for your own insurance this is eugenics and
[02:46.240 --> 02:49.240]  that's what Tom Daschle wrote about this book three years ago he's the guy
[02:49.240 --> 02:53.520]  that authored the first bill that and most of that is inculcated into this
[02:53.520 --> 02:58.920]  legislation also we've gone all this supposed violence and somebody had a
[02:58.920 --> 03:03.880]  gas line cut from their propane tank a brother of a congressman probably done
[03:03.880 --> 03:06.680]  by a lawnmower that stuff happens all the time and they're saying they think
[03:06.680 --> 03:13.440]  it's terrorist one congressman did have a bullet fired into his office most of
[03:13.440 --> 03:17.920]  the time this stuff is staged or done by a supporter so they can draw sympathy
[03:17.920 --> 03:23.720]  to themselves but there is a lot of anger some of this could be real but
[03:23.720 --> 03:28.120]  congressman Eric Cantor comes out and says look we better not give a lot of
[03:28.120 --> 03:32.200]  attention to this because this is going to generate more and that's actually
[03:32.200 --> 03:36.640]  true the way the Democrats are hyping this and pushing this you got 300
[03:36.640 --> 03:41.440]  million people in this nation millions of mentally ill people and unstable folks
[03:41.440 --> 03:46.080]  and people that have had enough and this is giving them the idea to go out and
[03:46.080 --> 03:49.640]  be violent which is exactly what the Democrats have been wanting now in the
[03:49.640 --> 03:53.120]  last three four months I have been telling you that coming up in April I
[03:53.120 --> 03:56.800]  believe the government is going to stage terror attacks and blame it on
[03:56.800 --> 04:04.240]  patriot groups tea parties and the Joe Stack situation at the IRS building very
[04:04.240 --> 04:08.160]  suspicious has all the earmarks of a government operation the Pentagon
[04:08.160 --> 04:12.600]  definitely has all the earmarks of government operation I'd say above 90
[04:12.600 --> 04:17.840]  percent chance family warned got his gun from a government lockup in Tennessee
[04:17.840 --> 04:22.000]  same lockup that gave the guy that shot up the Nevada federal courthouse got his
[04:22.000 --> 04:26.040]  gun there he's on all these psychotropic drugs he had been involved in
[04:26.040 --> 04:33.520]  Pentagon programs previously same thing with Joe Stack on and on and on and the
[04:33.520 --> 04:37.960]  way they were blaming 9-11 truth within an hour and a half or less look is a
[04:37.960 --> 04:43.000]  very important broadcast today so many facets of news and information a ship
[04:43.000 --> 04:47.040]  has been sunk off the coast of North Korea a South Korean vessel with a
[04:47.040 --> 04:51.400]  hundred hands on board looks like the North may have torpedoed it things are
[04:51.400 --> 04:55.200]  definitely heating up Obama says he's signing a nuke treaty with the Russians

[08:24.240 --> 08:29.280]  52 minutes spanning out before us we're gonna have wide open telephones coming
[08:29.280 --> 08:33.160]  up later in the hour Bob Chapman with us once a week visit will join us to talk
[08:33.160 --> 08:41.080]  about the globalist fascistic health care bill we're gonna cover the supposed
[08:41.080 --> 08:46.800]  violence and threats against the Democrats and how they're using this as a
[08:46.800 --> 08:51.040]  distraction from the fact that major polls 80 plus percent of the American
[08:51.040 --> 08:54.720]  people are against this legislation the more they learn about it the more they
[08:54.720 --> 09:03.000]  hate it that is all coming up today as well also South Korean Navy ship hit by
[09:03.000 --> 09:08.000]  torpedo a South Korean naval vessel with more than 100 aboard was sinking in
[09:08.000 --> 09:14.360]  waters here in North Korea after a suspected torpedo attack continuing
[09:14.360 --> 09:27.120]  Obama and Russian President Dmitry Mededev to sign new nuclear arms treaty the
[09:27.120 --> 09:31.120]  two leaders will meet in Prague next month to sign the agreement the White
[09:31.120 --> 09:38.880]  House says the deal would cut the number of deployed weapons by 25% so that's
[09:38.880 --> 09:45.400]  some of the international news that we're going to be covering today personal
[09:45.400 --> 09:52.160]  income drops across the country personal income in 42 states fell in 2009 you
[09:52.160 --> 09:55.720]  always get these numbers of few months after the year ends the Commerce
[09:55.720 --> 09:59.640]  Department said Tuesday and remember that's with a group cooking the books
[09:59.640 --> 10:05.760]  Nevada's 4.8% plunge was the steepest as construction and tourism industries
[10:05.760 --> 10:11.440]  took a beating also hit hard Wyoming where incomes fell by 3.9% and they've
[10:11.440 --> 10:15.080]  got big studies out I've seen the last few months where most Europeans won't
[10:15.080 --> 10:19.920]  come to the US now because the naked body scanners the harassment it's easier to
[10:19.920 --> 10:27.360]  fly to China or two places like Iran than it is to fly to the United States
[10:27.360 --> 10:32.400]  which is exactly what our ruling elite want they want to shut down the economy
[10:32.400 --> 10:38.840]  and any job creation bills they have our stimulus packages are only payoffs to
[10:38.840 --> 10:44.480]  select corporations and industries that well in many cases are owned by Al Gore
[10:44.480 --> 10:50.040]  he owns a stock in more than 20 so-called solar energy and wind energy
[10:50.040 --> 10:53.920]  companies and I was looking at list of cities taking taxpayer money to put
[10:53.920 --> 10:59.720]  these in in every case chiching chiching chiching chiching for Al Gore and for
[10:59.720 --> 11:03.800]  all these people I keep seeing these reports in the news about let's make
[11:03.800 --> 11:09.000]  Congress cut their pay you know the few hundred thousand dollars a year these
[11:09.000 --> 11:12.640]  people make they don't spend millions of dollars to get into Congress to get a
[11:12.640 --> 11:17.000]  couple hundred thousand they get in there for special interest to pay them
[11:17.000 --> 11:21.480]  off and to get sweetheart deals on the side there's many ways they pay off
[11:21.480 --> 11:26.560]  politicians politicians will buy a piece of property and then some local
[11:26.560 --> 11:29.960]  real estate baron will pay them two three times what it's worth or they'll
[11:29.960 --> 11:36.960]  hire their children or they'll hire their wife and it's just what's so
[11:36.960 --> 11:41.960]  incredible is that now this is all out in the open decades ago congressmen
[11:41.960 --> 11:45.840]  routinely went to prison every year different congressmen were convicted
[11:45.840 --> 11:54.480]  and went to prison just just countless numbers now no Obama and his group of
[11:54.480 --> 11:58.560]  criminals know the sky is the limit and so they just openly give congress
[11:58.560 --> 12:06.760]  members wives high paid jobs in the federal government or corporations that
[12:06.760 --> 12:09.880]  stand to make money off the health care takeover they give them jobs and it's
[12:09.880 --> 12:13.360]  all out in the open daryl issa representative is calling for a
[12:13.360 --> 12:18.080]  special prosecutor to investigate white house bribery quid pro quo so so that's
[12:18.080 --> 12:22.360]  some good news right there but but we all need to push for that and this
[12:22.360 --> 12:28.600]  morning I just put into a search engine health care stocks up insurance health
[12:28.600 --> 12:34.720]  insurance stocks up and I found AP wall street journal and two other articles
[12:34.720 --> 12:39.400]  there were hundreds there but I just printed the top four I have those in
[12:39.400 --> 12:44.160]  my stuff in my stack because I keep getting emails and calls saying where's
[12:44.160 --> 12:49.320]  the proof the insurance companies wrote this the insurance companies three
[12:49.320 --> 12:53.520]  months ago were all over the news and in the wall street journal if you just
[12:53.520 --> 12:57.120]  want to go to the research saying we're gonna pull out of the support of this
[12:57.120 --> 13:03.240]  bill if it has a public option remember that whole fight they wrote the
[13:03.240 --> 13:06.480]  original bill that just makes you buy insurance and then allows them to cut the
[13:06.480 --> 13:11.080]  care you get and the federal government cuts the Medicare and Medicaid for the
[13:11.080 --> 13:15.840]  people that will be on the supposed free program this is a tax ladies and
[13:15.840 --> 13:19.720]  gentlemen and a way for the IRS to get involved in your life now I know the
[13:19.720 --> 13:25.600]  audience knows this and we have several million very intelligent activist
[13:25.600 --> 13:36.240]  listeners and it is so important day one early into this new world we're facing
[13:36.240 --> 13:42.760]  collectivism and tyranny and slavery and that's what this is dependency it is
[13:42.760 --> 13:49.960]  so essential that day one we don't let the establishment paint a false portrait
[13:49.960 --> 13:56.200]  here a false paradigm a false left-right paradigm the mainline Republican host
[13:56.200 --> 14:02.400]  like a tree full of parrots or a tree full of monkeys are chattering and
[14:02.400 --> 14:15.840]  chirping and tweeting the same sheep like Obama Obama did it Obama's a car me
[14:15.840 --> 14:28.760]  no soul the commies are gonna get us the commies are gonna get us well it's true
[14:28.760 --> 14:33.040]  the big central banks fund socialism communism and fascism as Carol quickly
[14:33.040 --> 14:39.080]  wrote in his seminal work for the elite in 1968 tragedy and hope that they wrote
[14:39.080 --> 14:45.720]  work with anybody who communalizes the general public's wealth to be fed into
[14:45.720 --> 14:52.480]  the elite's hands by the way I have the top communist newspaper attacking me
[14:52.480 --> 14:58.280]  saying 9-11 truth is a right-wing plot really I thought it was staged by bush
[14:58.280 --> 15:02.080]  and then I'm the founder of at least they got one thing right and then I'm an
[15:02.080 --> 15:07.720]  evil right-wing demon the communists totally funded by the Ford Foundation in
[15:07.720 --> 15:13.000]  the banks you make me sick you dirtbags we're gonna be talking about that a
[15:13.000 --> 15:23.920]  little bit later but day one we have to get it out there that this is a
[15:23.920 --> 15:31.120]  corporate looting masquerading with left cover that's all it is you've got all
[15:31.120 --> 15:36.800]  these idiot Democrats jumping up and down cheering and screaming and driving
[15:36.800 --> 15:40.680]  around euphorically I drove past some woman that had a Texans for Obama
[15:40.680 --> 15:45.960]  sticker and I was stuck at a red light with her and she just looked like the
[15:45.960 --> 15:52.920]  archetypal pinhead with coke bottle glasses dumbered a box of rocks and then
[15:52.920 --> 16:00.480]  I saw her government parking lot ID hanging off of her mirror and she just
[16:00.480 --> 16:09.440]  she's just in moron probably not a bad person means well and just stupid there
[16:09.440 --> 16:15.120]  were a few Democrats who I disagree with on their world view but at least they
[16:15.120 --> 16:19.920]  were honest and said look Howard Dean Dennis Kosenich this is a bailout to
[16:19.920 --> 16:23.120]  insurance companies this cuts Medicare and Medicaid this doesn't give you a
[16:23.120 --> 16:26.960]  public option this doesn't cover pre-existing conditions because that
[16:26.960 --> 16:31.520]  all sounds sweet in a perfect world let's give some people some something
[16:31.520 --> 16:36.560]  free because we're compassionate the problem is you create a giant trough of
[16:36.560 --> 16:43.320]  trillions of dollars big interests are going to steal it every time you send a
[16:43.320 --> 16:48.840]  bunch of money off to a government that lies 99% of the time that has
[16:48.840 --> 16:58.480]  national security anonymity and can do whatever they want what do you think is
[16:58.480 --> 17:02.160]  going to happen well they're going to build a police state up around that
[17:02.160 --> 17:09.280]  program to ensure that they can continue the unpopular program and expand it and
[17:09.280 --> 17:13.520]  that's what tyranny is people get into government they start robbing they start
[17:13.520 --> 17:16.800]  stealing they hire a bunch of criminals to carry it out for them they get a
[17:16.800 --> 17:20.240]  bunch people on their payroll and then they just grows like a cancer and your
[17:20.240 --> 17:28.200]  whole country collapses it's like going in they tell you got a brain tumor the
[17:28.200 --> 17:34.280]  size of a golf ball and they're telling you the brain tumors good for you we
[17:34.280 --> 17:39.120]  know 100% of the time what this does collectivism doesn't work if you're the
[17:39.120 --> 17:43.240]  general public it works for the elite it works for the government armored
[17:43.240 --> 17:47.560]  fortresses and the surveillance and the secret police and all the psychopaths
[17:47.560 --> 17:52.320]  that love the power that comes with an authoritarian system they get to control
[17:52.320 --> 17:56.720]  the media they get to control the theater they get to control film they get to
[17:56.720 --> 18:02.360]  control culture they get to create a new class structure and by the way Ed
[18:02.360 --> 18:09.640]  Schultz has come out and said well we've seized healthcare let's seize the
[18:09.640 --> 18:15.040]  media now they know they're unpopular they know they're criminal and they he
[18:15.040 --> 18:18.880]  knows he's a kingpin spokesman for these crooks and he's up there saying
[18:18.880 --> 18:23.440]  ban free speech on talk radio shut it all down and cast Sunstein at the
[18:23.440 --> 18:26.880]  White House is saying that the regulations are and the diversities are

[18:33.400 --> 18:38.640]  games ladies and gentlemen and I saw comments on prisonplanet.com where we
[18:38.640 --> 18:44.880]  posted the Ed Schultz audio going you disgusting Republican filth Alex Jones
[18:44.880 --> 18:50.240]  how dare you be backing up Rush Limbaugh
[18:52.680 --> 18:58.560]  I would back up Dennis Kucinich's free speech I don't agree with him saying all
[18:58.560 --> 19:02.920]  handgun should be banned I think it's horrible but he has a right as a citizen
[19:02.920 --> 19:08.480]  to say that and I don't agree with a lot of things Rush Limbaugh does he's a
[19:08.480 --> 19:13.000]  partisan hack who doesn't mind tyranny and the Constitution being butchered
[19:13.000 --> 19:17.440]  when it's Republicans doing it but he's never called for Democrats to have the
[19:17.440 --> 19:28.640]  free speech taken away and I saw those comments on that article on that post and
[19:28.640 --> 19:32.000]  that's why we're in trouble they control us to the left right paradigm the right
[19:32.000 --> 19:36.920]  wing is ready to see the left lose their rights the left wing is ready to see the
[19:36.920 --> 19:41.600]  right lose their rights the left wants to gouge the right out the right eye out

[24:08.520 --> 24:13.080]  all right i want to go through this step-by-step
[24:13.080 --> 24:20.400]  but i will reiterate it is essential
[24:20.400 --> 24:33.240]  that everyone tell everyone they know that this does not cover children with
[24:33.240 --> 24:40.040]  pre-existing conditions that much of the congress and executive branch is
[24:40.040 --> 24:48.280]  exempt from obama care law in the law and that this cuts medicare and
[24:48.280 --> 24:53.880]  medicare and that this is not some communist socialist takeover yes they're
[24:53.880 --> 24:58.800]  socializing your wealth to steal it the true nature of collectivism has to be
[24:58.800 --> 25:04.480]  exposed as a creation of the robber baron british class that was then
[25:04.480 --> 25:09.760]  exported worldwide this is serfdom it is feudalism it is slavery but they give
[25:09.760 --> 25:16.480]  us false terms to debate because if you can get the word out to mainline
[25:16.480 --> 25:26.880]  democrats who are not bad people that the insurance companies wrote this it
[25:26.880 --> 25:31.880]  will be that much easier to repeal and conservatives need to understand they
[25:31.880 --> 25:36.240]  think big corporations and big banks are always good and i hear the talk show
[25:36.240 --> 25:40.880]  host defending the poor insurance companies saying the government's
[25:40.880 --> 25:46.520]  taking them over no mega corporations are merging with the government it's
[25:46.520 --> 25:52.400]  fascism and if you want to use a term that's the closest modern term that
[25:52.400 --> 25:58.600]  this applies to or corporatism they're also getting ready to stage more
[25:58.600 --> 26:01.560]  violence and i didn't just start predicting this this week or last week
[26:01.560 --> 26:05.440]  you know every day i've been breaking down exactly what's going to happen
[26:05.440 --> 26:07.760]  because we've seen all the indicators and i'm gonna go over the latest
[26:07.760 --> 26:12.360]  developments on that and the congressman's office reportedly shot big
[26:12.360 --> 26:16.840]  international news when lew dobbs house gets shot up it's in a few new jersey
[26:16.840 --> 26:21.520]  newspapers and the media says oh i bet he's lying even though state police came
[26:21.520 --> 26:25.600]  out and documented that is how home had been shot then he was getting death
[26:25.600 --> 26:38.720]  threats but first i want to play this obnoxious clip i want to play this
[26:38.720 --> 26:47.200]  obnoxious clip of barack obama last night saying hey the world didn't end we
[26:47.200 --> 26:52.320]  didn't have armageddon and that's a talking point they've had for a while
[26:52.320 --> 26:56.200]  for several months that when this passes let's just see of the stock market
[26:56.200 --> 26:59.600]  crashes let's just see if it is the end of the world let's just see if everybody
[26:59.600 --> 27:07.160]  goes bankrupt knowing full well it's going to take years to face this sin here
[27:07.160 --> 27:12.640]  is barack obama there's been plenty of fear of mongering plenty of overheated
[27:12.640 --> 27:19.720]  rhetoric you turn on the news you'll see the same folks are still shouting about
[27:19.720 --> 27:25.800]  there's gonna be an end of the world because this bill passed i'm not
[27:25.800 --> 27:29.920]  exaggerating leaders of the republican party they called the passage of this
[27:29.920 --> 27:43.320]  bill armageddon armageddon end of freedom as we know it so after i signed
[27:43.320 --> 27:59.320]  the bill i looked around to see if there were any asteroids falling so funny
[27:59.320 --> 28:07.440]  sudden some cracks opening up in the earth turn out as a nice day and out of
[28:07.440 --> 28:11.960]  those cracks came birds were chirping tens of thousands of irs agents rolling
[28:11.960 --> 28:19.040]  down the mall with our people still have their doctors medical records from this
[28:19.040 --> 28:24.440]  day forward all of the cynics all the naysayers they're gonna have to confront
[28:24.440 --> 28:30.600]  the reality of what this reform is and what it isn't all right that's enough
[28:30.600 --> 28:35.240]  i have to find yeah because you always tell the truth about everything about
[28:35.240 --> 28:42.760]  not hiring lobbyist and not expanding wars and ending torture and ending the
[28:42.760 --> 28:47.680]  patriot act you lied about everything and it's on record it doesn't give
[28:47.680 --> 28:51.760]  coverage to children for pre-existing conditions it's on record they can still
[28:51.760 --> 28:55.920]  turn anybody down for insurance then you're forced on to the Medicare
[28:55.920 --> 29:00.920]  Medicaid system which conservatively will add 10 to 15 million new people in the
[29:00.920 --> 29:06.240]  next several years you cut the funding for that and then send more people into
[29:06.240 --> 29:12.360]  the system mm-hmm kind of like everybody pays into their unemployment
[29:12.360 --> 29:17.320]  insurance around the country but then they're denying more and more unemployment
[29:17.320 --> 29:24.400]  claims you talk about fear mongering you're the Democrats that say all our
[29:24.400 --> 29:29.400]  cities on the coast will flood and flowers won't smell good anymore that
[29:29.400 --> 29:33.760]  that's actually mainstream news and that we're all gonna be dead if we don't pay
[29:33.760 --> 29:36.920]  you an al gore a bunch of money and then it turns out it's all a premeditated
[29:36.920 --> 29:43.240]  line but no the scores of new taxes and regulations and the government making you
[29:43.240 --> 29:47.440]  buy something from a private company that is the opposite of the American way

[34:12.280 --> 34:16.760]  gonna get the equivalent of VA hospital care I was reading a story this morning
[34:16.760 --> 34:20.280]  about a guy who had a heart attack and they never even put a stethoscope to his
[34:20.280 --> 34:26.000]  chest a veteran I mean you're gonna get VA quality health care now but you'll
[34:26.000 --> 34:31.080]  never know you'll never care because you think you won and then it'll all be
[34:31.080 --> 34:36.600]  about Obama how Obama did this Obama the commie and then Obama will leave office
[34:36.600 --> 34:41.080]  the Republicans will keep most of this in place just like all the other
[34:41.080 --> 34:47.000]  collectivizing initiatives that Democrats have passed Republicans keep one
[34:47.000 --> 34:50.720]  of the most draconian presidents was Nixon with all of his socialism but
[34:50.720 --> 34:54.280]  that was okay cuz he was a Republican just like Schwarzenegger oh he's
[34:54.280 --> 35:04.080]  anti-gun he's pro open border but that's okay he's a Republican and like
[35:04.080 --> 35:07.720]  Obama said the birds are chirping everybody's walking down the street
[35:07.720 --> 35:12.960]  everything's pretty it's springtime they're gonna do this incrementally and
[35:12.960 --> 35:18.520]  that's their plan and they think that all of the research and all of the
[35:18.520 --> 35:24.080]  protesting and all of the phone calls will just subside and go away and they'll
[35:24.080 --> 35:29.480]  have with these attorney generals from now 12 states joining together to sue
[35:29.480 --> 35:34.240]  they'll put a ringer in there we'll get political payoffs and rise to the power
[35:34.240 --> 35:40.520]  structure they'll they'll throw that lawsuit that's why you got to pass state
[35:40.520 --> 35:45.120]  laws against it you've got to file private lawsuits because of how this
[35:45.120 --> 35:49.200]  legislation discriminates and let some of the unions be exempt from the
[35:49.200 --> 36:01.200]  catalytic health care tax now shifting gears into violence I have no doubt that
[36:01.200 --> 36:05.440]  some of the violent phone calls some of the threatening phone phone calls some
[36:05.440 --> 36:10.640]  of the threatening emails some of the defacing of democratic party offices
[36:10.640 --> 36:17.160]  around the country is real people are angry and that happens and it lets these
[36:17.160 --> 36:22.560]  criminals by the part of victims but there's no doubt from past activities
[36:22.560 --> 36:26.240]  that we've seen from these people that some of this is staged and you can't
[36:26.240 --> 36:32.080]  really believe anything they're saying and I have seen the ADL Southern
[36:32.080 --> 36:38.200]  Parvy Law Center media matters George Soros's outfits in the last year but
[36:38.200 --> 36:42.240]  but intensifying the drumbeat the last few months saying there will be terror
[36:42.240 --> 36:46.840]  attacks launched by the Tea Party groups by the birthers and by 9-11 truth
[36:46.840 --> 36:51.560]  they've even had Glenn Beck out there putting this out he knows it's coming
[36:51.560 --> 36:56.840]  he's distancing himself from it as a way to turn all this around and not discuss
[36:56.840 --> 37:02.640]  what's in the bill but to instead sell what Homeland Security has already been
[37:02.640 --> 37:14.000]  training for secretly the demonization of the American people the
[37:14.000 --> 37:17.920]  demonization of anyone that criticizes them they're in the media today saying
[37:17.920 --> 37:22.560]  how dare Sarah Palin criticize the health bill it's causing dangerous hate
[37:22.560 --> 37:30.560]  she's got to have her speech restricted Schultz of MSNBC is running around
[37:30.560 --> 37:36.320]  saying the same thing and that's coming up it doesn't matter when Union thugs
[37:36.320 --> 37:40.320]  beat people up it doesn't matter when LaRaza or Mecha beat people up from
[37:40.320 --> 37:45.520]  California to Florida then it's only on YouTube maybe in the local newspaper but
[37:45.520 --> 37:50.520]  never a big national issue when Lou Dobbs house get shot up it was in one or
[37:50.520 --> 37:55.920]  two newspapers in New Jersey and then meanwhile you have this Homeland
[37:55.920 --> 38:02.920]  Security today article new vigilance needed in wake of health care vote this
[38:02.920 --> 38:08.280]  came out four days ago before all of this even started which shows more
[38:08.280 --> 38:13.120]  evidence of this being staged and then they link to the right-wing extremism
[38:13.120 --> 38:18.840]  current economic and political climate fueling reassurgence and radicalization
[38:18.840 --> 38:25.760]  and recruitment this is the report from a year ago that we were given by law
[38:25.760 --> 38:30.400]  enforcement see they had all this set up people are like where's the violence a
[38:30.400 --> 38:34.200]  year ago they knew that the unconstitutional criminal things they're
[38:34.200 --> 38:39.520]  doing would elicit a radicalization because they are radical and then now
[38:39.520 --> 38:42.880]  you've got them all over the news all scared oh my gosh and I heard Fox News
[38:42.880 --> 38:46.520]  this morning on XM driving into work they were saying oh it is terrible that
[38:46.520 --> 38:50.680]  some people are throwing bricks through windows oh my gosh we've got to act like
[38:50.680 --> 38:53.800]  adults and we're gonna see the Republicans and Democrats have a joint
[38:53.800 --> 39:03.240]  press conference today and talk about how we all need to get along shifting the
[39:03.240 --> 39:08.600]  debate away from what's in the bill to how anyone that criticizes it is linked
[39:08.600 --> 39:13.480]  to terrorism and how they're the Tea Party's connected in with al-Qaeda white
[39:13.480 --> 39:17.440]  al-Qaeda is everywhere they're going to get us we need to use homeland security
[39:17.440 --> 39:22.120]  on the American people we need to pass Lindsey Graham's bill that says they can
[39:22.120 --> 39:26.840]  arrest US citizens without even any suspicion for any reason and quote have
[39:26.840 --> 39:32.400]  enhanced interrogation by the Pentagon and it will take an act of Congress to
[39:32.400 --> 39:36.600]  ever get you released from prison no judge no jury no indictment I mean they
[39:36.600 --> 39:42.320]  actually have bipartisan legislation to turn America into an open gulag they're
[39:42.320 --> 39:46.920]  building FEMA camps everywhere the National Emergency Centers Act they
[39:46.920 --> 39:49.720]  admit in homeland security drills they're gonna use sports stadiums and
[39:49.720 --> 39:52.960]  other facilities and then they come out and say but it's a conspiracy theory
[39:52.960 --> 39:57.800]  that people are worried about this when they have open gulag legislation and
[39:57.800 --> 40:00.960]  under the Patriot Act they can already do these type of things and under the
[40:00.960 --> 40:05.400]  John Warner Defense Authorization Act PDD 51 are you listening I'm giving you
[40:05.400 --> 40:11.440]  facts here not rhetoric not opinion under the Enemy Combatant Act we had
[40:11.440 --> 40:16.200]  constitutional lawyers on documenting that has language where they can grab
[40:16.200 --> 40:26.880]  US citizens and secretly hold them and torture them this is gulag America out
[40:26.880 --> 40:31.200]  in the open and they criticize anybody that criticizes what they're doing and
[40:31.200 --> 40:38.240]  imply it doesn't exist it's like I had David Rothschild air the Rothschild
[40:38.240 --> 40:42.360]  fortune on a few years ago got him on he's promoting a book and I said you
[40:42.360 --> 40:45.960]  guys are planning a carbon tax but see they weren't done yet with the phase of
[40:45.960 --> 40:49.400]  brainwashing the public that something's got to be done for the earth all
[40:49.400 --> 40:54.240]  their white papers said that they were gonna set up all these carbon taxes to
[40:54.240 --> 41:02.560]  selectively shut down any industry they didn't control and he said no there's
[41:02.560 --> 41:06.240]  no tax even though Al Gore was already in Congress starting the next phase of
[41:06.240 --> 41:10.160]  admitting it then you see him a few months later on television promoting
[41:10.160 --> 41:18.480]  global carbon tax just like they've said for decades there's no plan for banks to
[41:18.480 --> 41:22.200]  set up a world government and bankrupt nations to bring them under their
[41:22.200 --> 41:27.400]  control no matter how many IMF World Bank documents we had they were busy
[41:27.400 --> 41:32.760]  setting it up they were busy building it and now they've got it in place so
[41:32.760 --> 41:35.960]  they're announcing and saying it's a good thing and and what are these
[41:35.960 --> 41:39.600]  Homeland Security reports say we're insane there's no world government none of
[41:39.600 --> 41:46.120]  this is happening and if you talk about it you're a cop killer and so in this
[41:46.120 --> 41:49.760]  report they link to the my act report they link to the Homeland Security
[41:49.760 --> 41:53.640]  master report they link to the latest Southern Poverty Lawson report that
[41:53.640 --> 41:59.000]  demonizes yours truly so every cop in the country is being given this and
[41:59.000 --> 42:05.560]  they're reading about how evil I am and if you read the big Communist
[42:05.560 --> 42:12.360]  newspaper challenge the revolutionary Communist newspaper of Progressive
[42:12.360 --> 42:18.640]  Labor Party one of the biggest if not the biggest communist publication in the
[42:18.640 --> 42:24.880]  United States and who do they single out as the numero uno enemy 9-11 truth
[42:24.880 --> 42:34.440]  movement a right-wing creation the story largely provided by Alex Jones and his
[42:34.440 --> 42:42.680]  modest media empire in Austin Texas and then it goes on to basically say that if
[42:42.680 --> 42:46.880]  you believe 9-11 can be an inside job you're an evil right-winger let me see
[42:46.880 --> 42:52.480]  we expose the Bush handlers for staging 9-11 and so we are right-wingers you got
[42:52.480 --> 42:56.160]  the left you got the right you have the whole establishment coming after Alex
[42:56.160 --> 43:05.840]  Jones and why is that why is that because we're effective and we know what
[43:05.840 --> 43:13.280]  we're talking about and then they go on to slander me and they say that I put
[43:13.280 --> 43:25.960]  out the protocols of the earned elders of Zion and it's all lies but see it
[43:25.960 --> 43:29.040]  doesn't matter if it's David Rothschild it doesn't matter if it's a Communist
[43:29.040 --> 43:33.040]  newspaper it doesn't matter if it's the Southern Prairie Law Center ADL that's
[43:33.040 --> 43:39.120]  what they do they're there premeditatedly lying to their moron
[43:39.120 --> 43:45.200]  constituents these are people that like to be lied to this is people that enjoy
[43:45.200 --> 43:55.440]  sitting there and reading fantasy I have never talked about the earned elders of
[43:55.440 --> 44:13.000]  Zion connected to 9-11 complete and total defamation so you've got all these
[44:13.000 --> 44:25.720]  different minions of the establishment like Schultz saying censor selectively
[44:25.720 --> 44:28.920]  people they don't like you've got all these White House officials calling for
[44:28.920 --> 44:33.240]  it you've got the government seizing health care for private interest cutting
[44:33.240 --> 44:37.360]  Medicare and Medicaid and you got the Communist cheerleading it and saying I'm
[44:37.360 --> 44:43.160]  bad that's what Communist leadership always do they always back up the banks
[44:43.160 --> 44:51.160]  they always love robbing the dumb down mass that's all this is the only way you
[44:51.160 --> 44:54.960]  protect yourself is by slashing government that doesn't mean privatizing
[44:54.960 --> 45:02.760]  just trading one government system for a private corporate government so the
[45:02.760 --> 45:08.040]  government can use force at the barrel of a gun for their massive tax increases
[45:08.040 --> 45:11.040]  they can have the IRS running your medical records and giving it to whoever
[45:11.040 --> 45:16.560]  they want and finding you if you buy medical coverage they don't agree with
[45:18.160 --> 45:23.160]  but then they whine and scream and get all scared when a couple rocks get thrown
[45:23.160 --> 45:27.120]  through some windows and somebody shoots into a congressman's office I mean
[45:27.120 --> 45:36.240]  same congressman voted for killing over a million Iraqis in Iraq and I'm not
[45:36.240 --> 45:39.080]  saying violence is the way to go that's why I've been telling you they've been
[45:39.080 --> 45:48.360]  setting the stage for staged events this is what they did in 1995 the feds
[45:48.360 --> 45:51.160]  bombed Oklahoma City if you haven't researched that go look into it
[45:51.160 --> 45:56.640]  absolute proof FBI agents names who bombed it who ran it to even come out
[45:56.640 --> 46:08.520]  in mainstream news here and there FBI ATF absolute fact
[46:10.920 --> 46:17.440]  and criminals do the same things over and over again and there's a lot of
[46:17.440 --> 46:26.480]  pieces of information that go into this but I'm telling you late April from all
[46:26.480 --> 46:30.800]  the TV shows they're producing the current programming the build-up and I
[46:30.800 --> 46:35.360]  told you you see lots of little events both real and manufactured as the
[46:35.360 --> 46:41.240]  preparatory phase just putting it in the minds building up to this and then
[46:41.240 --> 46:44.240]  while you're all distracted by a federal building that's blown up or a
[46:44.240 --> 46:50.120]  congressman who's shot when the feds will probably pick some federal building
[46:50.120 --> 46:55.280]  that's got a daycare again so they can show some dead kids or bleeding kids
[46:55.280 --> 46:59.200]  then they'll pass their carbon taxes their amnesty and everything else because
[46:59.200 --> 47:04.000]  nobody can criticize them after all you're violent if you do you're connected
[47:04.000 --> 47:07.280]  to violent groups and so a lot of people will get scared and will stop
[47:07.280 --> 47:11.480]  speaking out but this isn't 1995 this isn't 15 years ago it's not gonna work
[47:11.480 --> 47:17.000]  system the words out mainline talk radio saying the Democrats are staging
[47:17.000 --> 47:27.320]  this with no real proof probably are though and the jigs up so we're in a
[47:27.320 --> 47:33.720]  fight for our lives here but we're in the fight we've got a chance so you
[47:33.720 --> 47:37.400]  expose the healthcare legislation is just a robbery a vertical integration of
[47:37.400 --> 47:42.000]  industry and a transfer of wealth from the middle class to the elite and a
[47:42.000 --> 47:46.320]  cutting of the chicken feed benefits to the poor but they they're the poor
[47:46.320 --> 47:50.280]  they're ignorant they're dumbed down they've been drinking fluoride and getting
[47:50.280 --> 47:54.640]  mercury shots their whole life they they're not gonna know you're not gonna
[47:54.640 --> 47:58.440]  be able to explain it to them you got explained to the middle class somebody
[47:58.440 --> 48:01.680]  who's run a business somebody who's got some smarts and I'm not saying there
[48:01.680 --> 48:04.920]  aren't really smart people that are poor out there but you know of the really
[48:04.920 --> 48:08.360]  poor people a lot of them are fans of this they really think that the
[48:08.360 --> 48:13.480]  government wants to give them a goodie let's go ahead and play congressman
[48:13.480 --> 48:18.520]  Eric Cantor here he is talking about being shot at there been a lot of
[48:18.520 --> 48:23.320]  reports and the potential for violence against members of Congress over the
[48:23.320 --> 48:30.840]  last several days let me be clear I do not condone violence there are no
[48:30.840 --> 48:35.080]  leaders in this building no rank-and-file members in this building that
[48:35.080 --> 48:42.800]  condone violence period I've received threats since I assumed elected office
[48:42.800 --> 48:50.560]  not only because of my position but also because I'm Jewish I've never blamed
[48:50.560 --> 48:59.320]  anyone in this body for that period any suggestion that a leader in this body
[48:59.320 --> 49:06.800]  would incite threats or acts against other members is akin to saying that I
[49:06.800 --> 49:14.560]  would endanger myself my wife or my children just recently I have been
[49:14.560 --> 49:19.400]  directly threatened a bullet was shot through the window of my campaign office
[49:19.400 --> 49:25.040]  in Richmond this week and I've received threatening emails but I will not
[49:25.040 --> 49:31.000]  reason I will not release them because I believe such actions will only encourage
[49:31.000 --> 49:40.120]  more to be sent I want to stress this and it's very important legitimate
[49:40.120 --> 49:45.680]  threats should be treated as security issues and they should be dealt with by
[49:45.680 --> 49:51.520]  the appropriate law enforcement officials it is reckless to use these
[49:51.520 --> 49:58.480]  incidents as media vehicles for political gain that is why I have deep
[49:58.480 --> 50:06.160]  concerns that some D triple C chairman Chris Van Hollen and DNC chairman Tim
[50:06.160 --> 50:12.360]  Kane in particular are dangerously fanning the flames by suggesting
[50:12.360 --> 50:20.160]  suggesting that these incidents be used as a political weapon all right now you
[50:20.160 --> 50:25.080]  actually heard some truth there when you have real terror attacks or real
[50:25.080 --> 50:30.840]  political violence the handbook until the 90s stated that every law enforcement
[50:30.840 --> 50:36.240]  agency used you don't hype it up you don't give it coverage now when you see
[50:36.240 --> 50:42.520]  an underwear bombing or you see a 9-11 when it's stage they hype it and the
[50:42.520 --> 50:46.800]  fact that they are hyping it will cause some copycats whether it's staged or
[50:46.800 --> 50:54.080]  not to go out and attack and this guy realizes that and the Democrats are
[50:54.080 --> 50:58.000]  hyping this are pushing it and it's gonna probably cause some mentally ill
[50:58.000 --> 51:02.640]  people to get the idea in there had to go shoot a congressman is it safe to
[51:02.640 --> 51:06.720]  breathe anymore crowded public places global pandemics and news reports of

[54:15.080 --> 54:19.800]  suicide and the only way to raise themselves from the dead is to play the
[54:19.800 --> 54:27.000]  part of victims and now not just Michael Savage but Rush Limbaugh is

[54:56.160 --> 55:01.400]  FCC a whole bunch of members of Congress but but 10 in the Obama
[55:01.400 --> 55:06.200]  administration writing white papers giving speeches in between praising
[55:06.200 --> 55:11.040]  Chavez or Mao they say we need to restrict free speech in America now our
[55:11.040 --> 55:15.440]  free speech anybody criticizing the government it's now called hate and it's
[55:15.440 --> 55:19.640]  in the news today they're saying that Sarah Palin is being hateful whether you
[55:19.640 --> 55:26.160]  love her or hate her the point is she's milk toast but if they can take her and
[55:26.160 --> 55:29.560]  then blame her for what's happening and try to demonize criticism of the
[55:29.560 --> 55:37.520]  government they can go anywhere now here's Ed Schultz yesterday on his radio
[55:37.520 --> 55:43.960]  show saying shut up Rush Limbaugh and shut up anyone criticizing the
[55:43.960 --> 55:47.840]  government and implying that you're not allowed to have political views on a
[55:47.840 --> 55:53.840]  radio show but he's allowed to have his views on radio and TV now whether you
[55:53.840 --> 55:58.200]  agree with Limbaugh or don't the only monopoly we've had is the left right
[55:58.200 --> 56:02.720]  control paradigm of the Republicans and the Democrats being the only people on
[56:02.720 --> 56:07.840]  dominant radio and not constitutionalist not libertarians I'm trying to change
[56:07.840 --> 56:15.720]  that and pretty soon we're gonna be up there close to 100 stations we got four
[56:15.720 --> 56:21.300]  stations last week three the week before two new stations this week XM two
[56:21.300 --> 56:28.400]  weeks ago went to six nights a week rebroadcasting part of the broadcast part
[56:28.400 --> 56:35.120]  of the show Obama's openly announcing cyber security that he can shut the
[56:35.120 --> 56:38.640]  web down or censor whoever he wants the New York Times Time Magazine are
[56:38.640 --> 56:42.360]  proposing shutting down anyone that criticizes the government I mean they're
[56:42.360 --> 56:48.720]  saying this word-for-word they mean business and they will stage terror
[56:48.720 --> 56:52.680]  attacks as the pretext to do it and they've been lining up the police and
[56:52.680 --> 56:56.640]  military and brainwashing them and prepping them for this there's no
[56:56.640 --> 57:00.360]  doubt they must do it that's why Limbaugh has said they're gonna stage
[57:00.360 --> 57:04.160]  something and try to suspend the election there's nothing else they can
[57:04.160 --> 57:10.800]  do and the Republican Party's going in trying to block real candidates like
[57:10.800 --> 57:15.200]  Rand Paul in Kentucky for the Senate let's play a clip of Ed Schultz this is
[57:15.200 --> 57:18.920]  a vicious and he says we've seized control of health care now let's seize
[57:18.920 --> 57:24.000]  the media they're going for broke their lawless crooks and this guy is so on
[57:24.000 --> 57:28.800]  America to call for this here it is it is a cultural war that's taking place in
[57:28.800 --> 57:33.400]  America you're exactly right and it's being played out over the airwaves of
[57:33.400 --> 57:40.960]  America and I hope the Democrats now turn to the fairness doctrine it's time
[57:40.960 --> 57:45.200]  now for the Democrats to consider the fairness doctrine when you've got
[57:45.200 --> 57:50.720]  rush Limbaugh out there saying it's we've got to defeat these bastards he is
[57:50.720 --> 57:57.160]  now openly admitting that he is going to work against and campaign against the
[57:57.160 --> 58:02.920]  Republican against the Democratic Party and campaign against Obama and he is
[58:02.920 --> 58:08.560]  motivating people with the microphone and he's electioneering oh my god keep on

[01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:51.040]  magnitude of what these people are calling for to shut down their
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:55.720]  competition that's the nature of big government it's a bunch of control
[01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:59.760]  freaks who can't make it because nobody wants to listen to him what Schultz on

[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:10.160]  joke their top-rated show has four hundred thousand viewers and Glenn Beck
[01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:16.080]  posing as a patriot has four million my show has two million a day you think this
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:20.480]  guy likes the fact that no one wants to listen to him so he would it be like if

[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:56.480]  over the airwaves of America and I hope the Democrats now turn to the fairness
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:03:02.520]  doctrine it's time now for the Democrats to consider the fairness doctrine when
[01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:06.440]  you've got rush limbaugh out there saying it's we've got to defeat these

[01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:40.440]  reached the point where the Congress needs to equal it out equal out the
[01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:48.000]  audience and that means equal it out keep in mind there aren't any poor people

[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:10.240]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central we're here live back
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:15.640]  Sundays 4 to 6 p.m. all-times central websites are info wars.com and
[01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:21.200]  prison-planet.com we're gonna open the phones up on any issue or news story or
[01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:30.480]  item you wish to cover 1-800-259-9231 please have your points ready though
[01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:33.400]  because I'm gonna move quickly through your calls when we start going to them
[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:42.360]  1-800-259-9231 now I just wanted to go back we just did five minutes of search
[01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:53.040]  engine probing and out of the memory hole got five different articles from the
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:09:03.640]  last two years of Democrats and Republicans staging attacks on themselves I
[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:07.680]  would have to say eight times out of ten and you always find out about it later
[01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:13.360]  once it's not big headlines so the perception is still there people don't
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:18.120]  pay attention to the fine print they read the headlines but eight times out
[01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:23.440]  of ten on average when somebody knocks over trash cans or sets fire to trash
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:27.880]  cans or throws rocks at cops its cops they've been caught in Canada they've
[01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:30.400]  been caught in Colorado they've been caught in California they've been caught
[01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:37.840]  in Italy they're constantly being caught and it comes out in the news I'd have to
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:42.920]  say almost a hundred percent of the time on college campuses I've seen very few
[01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:46.800]  cases where it turns out it was real the guys have admitted it with the cotton
[01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:51.360]  balls by the black dormitory I guess saying your slaves are picking cotton
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:56.040]  that it looks like was real that happened a few weeks ago but every other
[01:09:56.040 --> 01:10:00.040]  case of swastikas on black dorms or Jewish dorms it's all been staged I
[01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:07.000]  see one of those every month or so and so statistically just historically most
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:13.000]  of this is probably staged which shows you how false flag terrorism not just at
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:19.000]  the local level or the micro level but at the larger international level is
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:23.200]  the name of the game as well and when they don't purely stage it they
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:28.480]  provocateur mental midgets to do it and that's come out again this week but
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:33.560]  here's the Denver post 08 race Denver post had line 08 race worker held in
[01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:41.560]  damage to Colorado HQ and they reportedly went and bashed out the
[01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:45.080]  windows and pictures of Barack Obama during the campaign to get him some more
[01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:52.240]  support one of two people suspected we went and looked it up they were later
[01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:58.040]  arrested and played out on I remember this case one of two people suspected of
[01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:01.880]  shattering 11 windows Tuesday morning at the state Democratic Party headquarters
[01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:05.960]  has an arrest record and a history of helping a Democratic political candidate
[01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:11.480]  public records show they bashed out the windows and photos posters of
[01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:19.320]  Barack Obama Denver post here's another one GWU student fakes hate admitted
[01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:23.720]  drawing swastikas on her own door the schools have learned how to catch them
[01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:27.560]  they just set up a hidden camera and it's always the students so they can get a
[01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:32.240]  bunch of attention and I got several other articles of fake swastikas and
[01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:35.600]  people setting fires to their own churches now it'll be fair remember
[01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:44.080]  back in 08 a woman in Pittsburgh and she let her admitted it woman with B
[01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:48.800]  scratched in face faked political attack she said black guy she's a 20 year
[01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:53.440]  old white woman at the time now 22 a scratch to be on her face but it was
[01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:56.600]  backwards and the cops noticed that she done it to herself in a mirror because
[01:11:56.600 --> 01:12:03.120]  the B was backwards what an idiot and the whole thing was staged in fake and so
[01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:08.640]  they arrested her so that's my point and we don't just get up here and say
[01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:14.440]  most of this is staged 80% of the time or higher but with the cops it's 90% of
[01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:19.200]  the time I and that's just the 10% of the time or less that we can't ever find
[01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:24.800]  out what really happened you know the cases are still open the cops stage
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:35.240]  attacks the Democrats stage attacks Republican idiots stage attacks this is
[01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:43.080]  human nature it's called a frame up now I'm gonna say it again it is paramount
[01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:52.320]  it is of peak importance it is of the first importance that we get the truth
[01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:57.760]  out about this this isn't just socialism this is a massive cut of Medicare and
[01:12:57.760 --> 01:13:01.640]  Medicaid and medical standards many members of Congress and the executive
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:05.840]  are exempt it does not cover pre-existing conditions the way I read the bill
[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:11.400]  for adults as well but AP says for children it has a national ID card in
[01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:16.200]  it but it has the IRS taking control of our lives it taxes medical savings
[01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:20.360]  accounts of anybody who gets treatments the government doesn't agree with the
[01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:26.200]  IRS gets to share your medical records but I digress the paramount issue here
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:31.000]  is we've got to get the truth out the right wing controlled Republican Party
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:35.760]  isn't gonna do it the control Democratic Party controlled by the very same
[01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:42.880]  special interest they're not going to do it they are all conspiring together the
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:46.440]  Republicans to play it off against the Democrats the Democrats are gonna try to
[01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:50.360]  sell it as something free for the poor and something you know loving and
[01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:55.600]  benevolent they're doing when in reality this is nothing but the bank owned
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:59.160]  insurance companies the top insurance companies consolidating their
[01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:04.000]  competition that's in business week riding the bill making you buy their
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:08.280]  overpriced cruddy health care think about it land of the free home of the
[01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:12.160]  brave the government says what type of health care you can have and tells you
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:21.520]  you've got to have it and so here is nasdaq.com health care stocks up after
[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:29.800]  passage of bill led by health insurance company stocks that's what's leading not
[01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:33.800]  just our stocks but in Europe because it's all owned by the same big banks
[01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:39.800]  they're all exploding driving the stock market up this week the major indexes
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:44.440]  of other stocks are down but not health care oh because the health care
[01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:48.400]  industry has really been dealt a big blow and they're in so much trouble and
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:55.680]  it's it's just horrible and limbaugh is up there every day saying oh the poor
[01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:58.640]  insurance companies they don't make that much money they're allowed to make
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:02.720]  money this is free market no the insurance companies in the last 40 years
[01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:06.240]  have gone in with the government and gotten people on the so-called welfare
[01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:10.200]  bandwagon and with all the red tape and bureaucracy it's ruined health care and
[01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:13.840]  increased all the cost and now it's only gonna get worse and the insurance
[01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:20.240]  company profits are gonna go up just like the banker bailout wasn't a banker
[01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:23.440]  bailout was a banker takeover and now they've got legislation for the federal
[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:26.760]  reserve to be able to take over any financial institution and that means
[01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:32.000]  dental offices hot dog stands you heard Napolitano yesterday that's in the bill
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:37.240]  to allow a select coterie of private central bankers to take over any other

[01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:04.520]  in the next year we're gonna sign a global constitution between the G20 and
[01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:08.400]  four other private central banks all interlocked they already run our
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:12.800]  countries they're setting up a global government amongst themselves and you

[01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:32.320]  folks this is a lawless criminal government we've got where they hate
[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:37.360]  the citizens and I'm not saying all the police are like this but they're
[01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:45.120]  commanders almost unanimously are they're hiring a bunch of shiflus scum
[01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:50.920]  now let me go over some of the economic news and I'm coming back and going into
[01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:58.200]  your calls personal income drops across the country personal income in 42
[01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:04.480]  states fell in 2009 the Commerce Department said Thursday and it says
[01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:13.040]  manufacturing home building and tourism being way down led the decline here's a
[01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:18.120]  New York Times article social security to see payout exceed pay-in this year but
[01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:22.200]  don't worry the government's launching a bunch of new taxes and expanding every
[01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:28.720]  federal program and Bush triple the size of government Obama in less than a year
[01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:36.280]  in office he's now been an over a year spent more than all presidents before
[01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:41.040]  him combined George Bush back to George Washington and those are official
[01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:49.320]  numbers that is not denied and as we get deeper into debt just like Greece the
[01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:54.480]  IMF will come in we'll lose our triple a rating and then and they'll say America
[01:26:54.480 --> 01:27:00.840]  is imploding banks loan us money and the IMF and World Bank will loan us our tax
[01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:06.840]  money back that's what the bailout was 28 trillion in the US and growing another
[01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:15.120]  20 that's a 28 billion excuse me 28 trillion in the US another 20 trillion
[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:24.080]  globally so we're talking we're talking about right up at 50 trillion stolen the
[01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:28.560]  last year and a half and the banks won't say where it went and then they go
[01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:32.160]  into all these different now Western nations they they're done fully
[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:38.600]  bankrupting the third world and taking total control and they come in and tell
[01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:43.240]  us that we're bankrupt so they've got to raise all of our taxes and then we go
[01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:49.640]  completely bankrupt they will come back and loan us our own money back talk
[01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:56.720]  about a fraud talk about a scam but they get away with it and then I saw it today
[01:27:56.720 --> 01:28:08.520]  a financial Times of London article that was actually extremely honest about the
[01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:14.640]  situation in Greece I was on Russia today yesterday before the announcement was
[01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:21.480]  made that the IMF will quote bailout Greece the IMF already set up the
[01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:26.040]  policies 10 years ago privately run by Goldman Sachs now Goldman Sachs
[01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:31.560]  executive openly runs the economy as their finance minister and they're
[01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:37.120]  calling it a bailout to come in and give them more loans at loan sharking rates
[01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:42.480]  as the entire infrastructure is handed over to the private banks it's not a
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:48.320]  rescue it's like a loan shark giving you another loan and here it is IMF
[01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:53.640]  struggles to conceal glee financial times though international monetary fund
[01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:57.240]  officials try to conceal their excitement at the thought of another
[01:28:57.240 --> 01:29:02.880]  country sliding towards financial disaster there is no doubt that leading a
[01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:08.320]  rescue effort for Greece will be an enormous prize decried a couple of years
[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:12.960]  ago is too small to be useful the IMF has expanded its lending capability
[01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:17.200]  rapidly thanks to a string of higher contributions from member governments
[01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:22.920]  i.e. the United States your tax money and led a series of rescues in troubled
[01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:28.360]  East European countries oh yeah they're rescuing them Jim Jones was rescuing his
[01:29:28.360 --> 01:29:33.680]  followers giving him cyanide lace Kool-Aid and then the article goes into

[01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:14.880]  edition Bob Chapman coming up to give us his take on government takeover of
[01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:21.000]  health care the private banks worldwide are running around jacking up
[01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:29.320]  environment taxes health care taxes transportation taxes retirement fund
[01:33:29.320 --> 01:33:34.000]  taxes bloomberg reported a week ago the federal government is instructing
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:40.840]  government pension funds to invest in quote bad debt in fact print me that
[01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:47.040]  bloomberg again pensions to be invested in government debt print me that again
[01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:49.640]  actually want to read from that when Bob Chapman's on with us because people
[01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:54.600]  email me and say they don't believe it I want you to actually hear this you know
[01:33:54.600 --> 01:34:02.640]  directly from the newspaper as I read it by the way a weekend of this bill not
[01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:08.000]  even a weekend of this bill being long I've got multiple mainstream reports
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:11.840]  here where health care companies are announcing massive increases in
[01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:15.000]  everybody's insurance well of course they've been given a green light to rape
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:21.720]  you because all they are is a private collection agency for the banks and
[01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:26.760]  lowering your standard of care but instead the republicans make this
[01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:32.040]  about is it morally right to make people get health insurance is it morally
[01:34:32.040 --> 01:34:36.080]  right to tax the middle class and give it to the poor that's not even what's
[01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:43.840]  happening here everybody's being robbed but the tiny elite I'm gonna get into
[01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:48.960]  this stack of news here in just a moment but before I do that I want to put a
[01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:57.280]  plug in here you know I'm pretty good at making informative very watchable
[01:34:57.280 --> 01:35:03.080]  educational documentary films they're among the most popular alternative
[01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:08.720]  documentary films in the world hands down and many newspapers have made that
[01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:14.240]  point for me I'm not tooting my horn well conservatively over a hundred
[01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:18.720]  hundred and fifty million people have watched my documentary films online for
[01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:34.680]  free but it is you the radio listeners that make all of that possible it is you
[01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:41.600]  the radio listeners that fund the radio show that fund the news websites and
[01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:47.880]  forewars.com prisonplanet.com it is you the radio listeners that buy the
[01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:55.640]  original DVDs that are literally the seed money or the funding mechanism for
[01:35:55.640 --> 01:36:03.000]  all of this we really have turned the establishment model on its head I never
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:09.600]  intended to do it I made my first documentary in 1997 13 years ago America
[01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:15.040]  destroyed by design and I immediately went on the radio and said please buy
[01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:22.720]  this VHS tape and please make copies of it I had to borrow four thousand dollars
[01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:31.720]  from my father and I had never really borrowed money from him before to take
[01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:38.400]  off from my radio show for two weeks in 1997 and drive around the country to show
[01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:44.440]  the UN plaques to show the executive order and then we would peaceably nicely
[01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:49.440]  dress nice it's all on video ask the park rangers to discuss the UN plaques and
[01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:56.600]  they would flip out and threaten to arrest us not just part of the film but I
[01:36:56.600 --> 01:37:01.320]  was living in a one-room apartment one room with a tiny kitchen in the bathroom
[01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:05.280]  some of the happiest years of my life by the way not having to worry about a
[01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:14.360]  bunch of junk and I had no intention of building this small media empire I had
[01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:19.080]  no intention of being the leader of the resistance against the New World Order
[01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:27.840]  on talk radio I had no intention on being the king of alternative documentary
[01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:36.040]  films no intention of having the ADL call me the conspiracy king or the news
[01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:41.840]  call me the founder of the 9-11 truth movement and that's another testament to
[01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:47.880]  what you can do by taking action and getting involved you may not be as
[01:37:47.880 --> 01:37:51.280]  successful as I've been but you will certainly reach thousands if you take
[01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:57.820]  action but from day one I told people to get my films make copies put them
[01:37:57.820 --> 01:38:02.600]  on access TV I just wanted to reach people and warn people about how Oklahoma
[01:38:02.600 --> 01:38:09.100]  City was an inside job how the government was staging terror attacks to
[01:38:09.100 --> 01:38:13.480]  demonize patriots how the UN was taking over our national resources and how our
[01:38:13.480 --> 01:38:17.040]  country was beginning to go into receivership to the IMF and World Bank
[01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:23.400]  now fast forward 13 years later I've made more than 20 films we've got two
[01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:27.360]  new films coming out in the month of April police state for the rise of FEMA
[01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:35.720]  an invisible Empire and who will order to find and both of these documentaries
[01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:41.160]  are available you can pre-order them now so you get them first we ship it out in
[01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:47.800]  the order they were received and your purchase funds what we're doing and if
[01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:53.680]  you can't afford the films within hours of them being released they're gonna be
[01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:58.000]  on YouTube and Google and we will link to them have all these business people
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:02.120]  and other talk show hosts and filmmakers saying why do you allow that doesn't it
[01:39:02.120 --> 01:39:07.240]  cut in on how many DVDs you sell absolutely we'd sell 10 times more DVDs
[01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:12.720]  I know other lesser filmmakers who make a lot more money than I do because they
[01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:17.640]  don't allow anybody to make copies they don't allow their stuff on the web but
[01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:24.160]  we're not here to make money I like to be comfortable I like to be secure like
[01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:28.120]  people to defend myself and having some treasure does that but it's just that
[01:39:28.120 --> 01:39:36.400]  fuel it's a tool and I'd like to make more money so I could pay my staff more
[01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:45.200]  but they're paid more than most people in radio in the positions they're in but
[01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:49.760]  in the final equation ladies and gentlemen it is you the prison planet TV
[01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:55.320]  members it is you the purchasers of the DVDs the books the films the t-shirts the
[01:39:55.320 --> 01:40:01.320]  ball caps that do fund our operation and we're just able to maintain our
[01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:08.800]  position and expand because of your support so I want to thank prison
[01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:15.040]  planet TV members you fund the CDNs the servers for all the
[01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:19.560]  websites you fund the two IT people I have that work here it's a big nut to
[01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:24.160]  crack but we have enough members to where you pay for that and see it as a
[01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:27.600]  donation I thank you and you do get fringe benefits you do get better
[01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:32.320]  quality podcasts we're adding next week a 64 kilobit stream just for members
[01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:36.920]  double the quality that's free we've added a live TV show component of the
[01:40:36.920 --> 01:40:40.920]  radio show or at least half the show is a multi-camera shoot with documents and
[01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:45.560]  video clubs extra expanded DVD extras that are only for prison planet TV
[01:40:45.560 --> 01:40:49.720]  members then the members rip it off prison planet TV which we appreciate and
[01:40:49.720 --> 01:40:57.840]  post it to the four wins in lower quality but that doesn't matter the point is
[01:40:57.840 --> 01:41:01.960]  when you're a prison planet TV member you can also burn Divx copies that play
[01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:06.600]  on almost all new deep in the last few years almost all new DVD players it's not
[01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:10.280]  even new DVD players anymore I guess a lot of DVD players about Divx on them
[01:41:10.280 --> 01:41:14.960]  for like five years now but the point is you can download it in that format you
[01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:18.840]  can stream it a bunch of different formats the quality is getting better
[01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:25.600]  and better we're attempting to go to actual high-def for some of the new
[01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:29.560]  releases like we're working on having this one an actual high-def if you
[01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:32.280]  choose to download it or watch it in that quality you've got to have a really
[01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:38.360]  good connection to do that but it is your support of prison planet TV that
[01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:44.000]  makes this radio show possible and it is your support of buying the DVDs and you
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:48.960]  see them in the highest quality they're in a nice color cover case your friends
[01:41:48.960 --> 01:41:52.520]  your family are more likely to watch them if you give them a copy that's in a
[01:41:52.520 --> 01:41:55.800]  nice case you're authorized to make copies if you're going to be making
[01:41:55.800 --> 01:42:00.080]  copies the best way to do it is not from some online cruddy you know version out
[01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:03.960]  there but to do it from prison planet dot TV we have the tools up there for you

[01:43:02.280 --> 01:43:06.320]  part of the film how the roundtable groups control society what their goals

[01:45:10.600 --> 01:45:14.560]  lot of news your phone calls and Bob Chapman I just wanted to speak my mind
[01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:18.280]  on this and explain to you the mindset I'm in me I'm so busy we've only made
[01:45:18.280 --> 01:45:25.080]  one trailer for each film I haven't even made radio ads yet for the films I'm not
[01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:29.040]  complaining it's just I don't even have the staff or the money to advertise the
[01:45:29.040 --> 01:45:34.320]  films elsewhere it's all up to you how big these films are the biggest film
[01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:41.960]  we've ever made ever released is Obama deception and it shatters the left-right
[01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:47.840]  paradigm that's because you made it big you carry the ball the second most
[01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:55.000]  powerful film in game before that next biggest film road to tyranny
[01:45:55.000 --> 01:46:04.520]  Obama deception really scared the system that's when I made all the big
[01:46:04.520 --> 01:46:07.920]  enemies list for the White House and everywhere else that's when they really
[01:46:07.920 --> 01:46:11.040]  started coming after me and I've had national news here I've had Chris
[01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:16.400]  Matthews crew here and they said yeah that film that films everywhere I'd say
[01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:26.000]  conservatively 50 million free views online hundred thousand dollar film to make 50 million people have seen it
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:34.240]  and that's conservative not counting 30,000 at the University of Arizona in
[01:46:34.240 --> 01:46:44.280]  Phoenix on record they videotaped the the warehouse full they have the
[01:46:44.280 --> 01:46:52.480]  students as volunteers made 30,000 that they gave out at two events 30,000 and
[01:46:52.480 --> 01:46:56.360]  that's going on all over the country that's why the system's in trouble and
[01:46:56.360 --> 01:47:00.120]  no amount of their propaganda can fix it they're gonna stage terror attacks
[01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:03.280]  they're gonna blow stuff up they're probably gonna try to put me in prison
[01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:07.040]  sooner rather than later but because I understand what they're doing and have
[01:47:07.040 --> 01:47:10.880]  exposed their game plan I may be safe plus God's protecting me because of your
[01:47:10.880 --> 01:47:16.720]  prayers but whatever the cost I'm not stopping it's a good feeling to be past
[01:47:16.720 --> 01:47:20.240]  the point no return and to be in a fight for your life folks and let me give you
[01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:24.360]  a little news tip here we're all in a fight for our lives this is real hard
[01:47:24.360 --> 01:47:34.480]  core bonafide evil this is real dictatorship of the elite their puppets
[01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:38.760]  come and go but the same scum stays in place okay let's talk to Jason in North
[01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:47.000]  Carolina you're on the air Alex thanks for having me on dot TV subscriber thank
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:52.320]  you and you bet sir thank you a couple of things I'm gonna I'll make it quick
[01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:57.840]  first thing I'd like to say is our in our Congress is is despicable and it's
[01:47:57.840 --> 01:48:01.880]  been I just think they've been despicable for some time based on their
[01:48:01.880 --> 01:48:06.880]  voting record I sent an email out to some of my friends last week that had the
[01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:15.280]  voting record records on both NAFTA and the repeal of the Glass-Steagall act in
[01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:20.040]  1999 and I think that I don't know I'm sure you're aware of how many senators
[01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:24.120]  actually have actually voted against repealing the Glass-Steagall act but
[01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:28.240]  before I looked it up I had no idea just how significant it was there was only
[01:48:28.240 --> 01:48:33.520]  seven senators who voted against repealing that act in 1999 so absolutely
[01:48:33.520 --> 01:48:39.800]  it was bipartisan Clinton Bush Obama all work for the banks they are nothing
[01:48:39.800 --> 01:48:44.520]  but a distraction and unless we realize that's what this insurance takeover is
[01:48:44.520 --> 01:48:49.480]  we're gonna lose this if we let the Democrats pose as if we're nice we gave
[01:48:49.480 --> 01:48:54.440]  poor people something free they are a pack of criminal scum liars and so are
[01:48:54.440 --> 01:48:58.080]  the Republicans the Republican leadership knows full well what this is all
[01:48:58.080 --> 01:49:03.360]  about yeah I couldn't agree with you more and it's just it's very sobering I I
[01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:08.480]  don't know how you can trust I mean again 2,700 page bills that nobody reads and
[01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:14.680]  the Patriot Act is is still going as strong as ever and you know I I know you
[01:49:14.680 --> 01:49:19.680]  know quote-unquote Democrat relatives and friends who are in complete denial of
[01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:24.560]  this in fact one of them said oh yeah that's that's just a stimulus package in
[01:49:24.560 --> 01:49:29.000]  essence that it creates jobs and I I was just looking at these people like you
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:34.200]  know it's like talking to idiots I don't know yeah it really is I was thinking
[01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:38.320]  about that this morning my biggest frustration is seeing people get conned
[01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:45.200]  and hurt and they have this giggling self-assured foolish smile on their face
[01:49:45.200 --> 01:49:49.440]  like they're part of the system and they're associating their identity with
[01:49:49.440 --> 01:49:53.840]  Obama and with Joe Biden just like Republicans associating their identity
[01:49:53.840 --> 01:49:58.560]  with Bush and Republicans telling me Bush isn't for the assault weapons ban
[01:49:58.560 --> 01:50:03.400]  you're a liar and loving their ignorance they think it's so cute they're so
[01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:09.960]  satisfied in it they love the fact that they're being conned it's a nation of
[01:50:09.960 --> 01:50:14.760]  children go ahead yeah I agree and they do usually grin when they say it which
[01:50:14.760 --> 01:50:18.720]  is your spot on about that unfortunately but oh no it's a pleasure it's an
[01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:22.960]  enjoyment because because they think you're just some right-winger and they're
[01:50:22.960 --> 01:50:27.760]  beating you and this is their time and they're showing you right now oh they're
[01:50:27.760 --> 01:50:32.320]  so good oh punch it and that's why they're going into bondage the elite
[01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:37.160]  look at these schmucks they look at these sacks of stupid garbage they look at
[01:50:37.160 --> 01:50:42.280]  these wanton fools and they say rape them rape them hard take everything they
[01:50:42.280 --> 01:50:46.040]  got poison their water come their kids down cut their medicare and Medicaid and

[01:54:17.560 --> 01:54:22.360]  Chapman coming up I'm gonna go to your calls in this segment and the next look
[01:54:22.360 --> 01:54:26.800]  I get angry at people that are willfully ignorant and I shouldn't call them names
[01:54:26.800 --> 01:54:30.280]  but they need to be psychologically slapped around or have a bucket of cold
[01:54:30.280 --> 01:54:35.240]  water thrown on them they're followers and they think they're on a winning team
[01:54:35.240 --> 01:54:39.360]  it's like people whose identity is wearing their favorite sports teams
[01:54:39.360 --> 01:54:45.480]  ball caps in jerseys and that's fine but that's a facsimile or a twisted version
[01:54:45.480 --> 01:54:50.560]  of human tribalism you should owe your allegiance to your family and to your
[01:54:50.560 --> 01:54:54.440]  republic and to the rights that protects you that your forefathers and
[01:54:54.440 --> 01:54:59.920]  mothers fought and died for and it's just like Republicans when they're in
[01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:03.800]  power they let their leadership do whatever they want because the media
[01:55:03.800 --> 01:55:07.920]  all phrases it like oh the Democrats don't want torture the Democrats don't
[01:55:07.920 --> 01:55:12.120]  want banker bailouts the Democrats don't want new wars the Democrats don't
[01:55:12.120 --> 01:55:17.040]  want a police state and then as soon as the Democrats get in power they don't
[01:55:17.040 --> 01:55:21.920]  just want all of that they accelerate it and then suddenly oh Republicans are
[01:55:21.920 --> 01:55:26.560]  against torture and war and banker bailouts and health care and so the
[01:55:26.560 --> 01:55:30.000]  Democrats all go well I'm gonna support it then if the Republicans you know if
[01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:34.000]  George W. Bush says global warming isn't real I I believe it's real and then he
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:40.520]  capitulated went along with it and when I'm here talking about my films the
[01:55:40.520 --> 01:55:45.280]  fact that we don't sell that many because people can get them for free I
[01:55:45.280 --> 01:55:50.080]  rather have 50 million people see the Obama deception for free than have a
[01:55:50.080 --> 01:55:59.040]  million dollars see it's a values issue I value every person we reach I value
[01:55:59.040 --> 01:56:03.200]  every person we wake up that's what's important to me that's my goal that's
[01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:06.160]  why I've been successful all these other people that just want to make money
[01:56:06.160 --> 01:56:13.600]  they haven't been successful because that's their only goal or other people
[01:56:13.600 --> 01:56:18.480]  to put out films and hoard them they end up selling more and making some money
[01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:23.760]  but they're not reaching as many people and conversely they're not as well known
[01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:27.640]  which is what these money grubbers actually want in the final equation
[01:56:27.640 --> 01:56:31.480]  that's what they're looking for but they don't get it because they're so
[01:56:31.480 --> 01:56:35.520]  jealously trying to hold everything into themselves whereas I just want to
[01:56:35.520 --> 01:56:41.000]  reach people so we are successful and I had no idea 14 years ago when when I
[01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:44.920]  set out to make a film and to do everything we've done here that I would
[01:56:44.920 --> 01:56:52.240]  be so successful because I was coming at it I'm not saying I'm a perfect person
[01:56:52.240 --> 01:56:57.440]  and I've got plenty of problems but my son said to me last night he said daddy
[01:56:57.440 --> 01:57:06.720]  I listen to your show sometimes and you have a lion's heart and I said what is
[01:57:06.720 --> 01:57:13.200]  a lion's heart I knew what the definition of a lion's heart is and he said
[01:57:13.200 --> 01:57:18.560]  well you care about people and you have courage and you want to help people and
[01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:23.520]  throughout my life I have had a good-natured view of the world and I
[01:57:23.520 --> 01:57:29.520]  have wanted to help others and I thought other people were all like me and we
[01:57:29.520 --> 01:57:34.080]  need the lion-hearted individuals out there the people who have strength who
[01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:38.760]  have the intellects to get off the bench and to go out there and to take action
[01:57:38.760 --> 01:57:44.000]  but that meant so much to me when my son said you are lion-hearted seven years
[01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:49.800]  old he's already reading high school level books voracious history reader much
[01:57:49.800 --> 01:57:55.640]  smarter than I am and to have him tell me that I'm a lion heart well some days
[01:57:55.640 --> 01:58:00.320]  I am some days I'm more like a devil heart because that is the duality of man
[01:58:00.320 --> 01:58:04.480]  and then there's that struggle angel pulling you one way a devil pulling you
[01:58:04.480 --> 01:58:09.200]  the other but I do strive to be lion-hearted and I did come at this
[01:58:09.200 --> 01:58:15.560]  from a open-hearted altruistic perspective of really trying to stand up
[01:58:15.560 --> 01:58:19.720]  against corruption and trying to protect the innocent and that's why I've been so
[01:58:19.720 --> 01:58:23.600]  successful and that's why it's important for those of you out there who know that
[01:58:23.600 --> 01:58:28.080]  you're good of heart and that you have the best interest of people in mind and
[01:58:28.080 --> 01:58:32.760]  that those of you that do want to sacrifice for liberty you need to stand
[01:58:32.760 --> 01:58:38.160]  up and take action because the world needs good people
[01:58:38.160 --> 01:58:43.320]  America's number one stories for independent talk radio for over a
[01:58:43.320 --> 01:58:50.560]  decade we are the GCN radio network hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the
[01:58:50.560 --> 01:58:54.480]  global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the
[01:58:54.480 --> 01:58:58.480]  Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become
[01:58:58.480 --> 01:59:02.320]  more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds about performing gold and
[01:59:02.320 --> 01:59:06.120]  silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again so
[01:59:06.120 --> 01:59:09.720]  our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of
[01:59:09.720 --> 01:59:15.200]  non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless

[01:59:49.480 --> 01:59:56.080]  Waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio
[02:00:00.080 --> 02:00:08.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[02:00:08.080 --> 02:00:15.600]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:15.600 --> 02:00:22.280]  Alex Jones okay I haven't done a good job of going to your calls I will
[02:00:22.280 --> 02:00:26.040]  throughout this entire hour with Bob Chapman going live at prisonplanet.tv
[02:00:26.040 --> 02:00:29.640]  for the balance of the transmission in the next segment let's talk to Kerry
[02:00:29.640 --> 02:00:34.980]  then Tim David Tim and others I got a caller from Brazil there maybe I should
[02:00:34.980 --> 02:00:39.080]  skip ahead to Brazil but let's go to Kerry in Wisconsin first you're on the
[02:00:39.080 --> 02:00:47.720]  year yeah looks I think guys this is what Katherine Austin Fitz would call a pump and dump with the healthcare bill it's the same thing that the
[02:00:47.720 --> 02:00:53.800]  Community Reinvestment Act was to the banks and as so far as the underwriters of
[02:00:53.800 --> 02:00:59.640]  mortgages 30 years ago and but instead of taking 25 30 years for the government to
[02:00:59.640 --> 02:01:04.280]  basically be the master bankroller of all the mortgages and the banks getting
[02:01:04.280 --> 02:01:08.200]  the money from it it's gonna take probably five years well Kerry I agree with
[02:01:08.200 --> 02:01:13.120]  you but it's worse than that the government is the muscle and the manager
[02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:17.080]  that implements it but the profit all goes to offshore banks and yes they're
[02:01:17.080 --> 02:01:20.760]  gonna healthcare costs are already exploding this week because the more
[02:01:20.760 --> 02:01:25.400]  money you dump in the more bureaucracy the more the cost goes up and show the
[02:01:25.400 --> 02:01:29.120]  insurance companies that are owned by the banks their stocks are all just
[02:01:29.120 --> 02:01:33.680]  exploding right now and absolutely and they're gonna get us in even more debt
[02:01:33.680 --> 02:01:37.760]  and in five years say we got to have even more taxes or it's all gonna go
[02:01:37.760 --> 02:01:42.160]  bankrupt again and then they get you deeper and deeper into the collectivist
[02:01:42.160 --> 02:01:48.520]  model this is how they domesticate us yeah and you know it's proven the fact
[02:01:48.520 --> 02:01:51.840]  that they have the IRS collecting this money that the money is going to the
[02:01:51.840 --> 02:01:54.920]  banks which as you say all in the insurance companies that all insurance
[02:01:54.920 --> 02:01:59.120]  companies are financial institutions Geico is not owned by Lizard it's owned by
[02:01:59.120 --> 02:02:03.160]  Berkshire Hathaway which is Warren Buffett's multi-multi-billion dollar
[02:02:03.160 --> 02:02:08.140]  investment and who's one of the biggest lobbyists for the health bill Warren the
[02:02:08.140 --> 02:02:15.000]  eugenicist pig Buffett absolutely he has a lot of his firm owns a lot of stock
[02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:19.480]  in corporate bonds in all of the various insurance companies but as you know the
[02:02:19.480 --> 02:02:24.760]  church committee under Reagan what nearly 30 years ago proved that 100% of
[02:02:24.760 --> 02:02:29.800]  the money that the IRS collects goes to the private banking cartel that runs the
[02:02:29.800 --> 02:02:33.280]  financial reserve system so the fact that the IRS is going to be the collection
[02:02:33.280 --> 02:02:40.240]  agency for this so-called health care reform bill is proof of who the money
[02:02:40.240 --> 02:02:45.000]  yeah yeah that's the that's the banker's errand boy that's who cook you know the
[02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:50.480]  same day we got the Federal Reserve we got the income tax back in 1913 or in
[02:02:50.480 --> 02:02:54.320]  that same month because that's the collection agency and this is the
[02:02:54.320 --> 02:02:58.840]  private mafia's enforcer it you know it's like of the Chicago or New York mob
[02:02:58.840 --> 02:03:04.600]  the Genoveses or you know others send a thud to your house to collect the debt
[02:03:04.600 --> 02:03:12.400]  that's what the IRS is is literal mafia private bank enforcers absolutely and I
[02:03:12.400 --> 02:03:16.040]  was wondering if you could ask Bob Chapman when he comes on to comment
[02:03:16.040 --> 02:03:19.640]  yesterday on what happened in the Treasury market with the Treasury auction
[02:03:19.640 --> 02:03:23.920]  because it was a real shaker and of course what you were asking him you
[02:03:23.920 --> 02:03:27.960]  could say you can ask him earlier about how that all of the bank owned insurance
[02:03:27.960 --> 02:03:32.440]  companies so-called health health care companies are rallying off of this
[02:03:32.440 --> 02:03:36.560]  because of course they're rallying off of this they've basically been they
[02:03:36.560 --> 02:03:40.840]  basically now gain GSE status government sponsored enterprise just like
[02:03:40.840 --> 02:03:46.640]  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and Sally Mae and Ginny Mae all of those are so-called
[02:03:46.640 --> 02:03:51.680]  private corporations publicly held but private as in non-governmental but 100
[02:03:51.680 --> 02:03:54.920]  percent of their debt everything they do is backed by the government with the
[02:03:54.920 --> 02:03:58.600]  promise that the government will cover all of their their wrongdoing by
[02:03:58.600 --> 02:04:02.880]  extracting money from the taxpayer and they get to cut the quality they get to
[02:04:02.880 --> 02:04:06.680]  raise the price they get to cut Medicare Medicaid it doesn't cover kids with
[02:04:06.680 --> 02:04:10.800]  pre-existing conditions it doesn't let you choose your doctor Paul Watson's

[02:08:10.800 --> 02:08:13.800]  little bit of the next hour if he wants to we're gonna be going to your calls
[02:08:13.800 --> 02:08:20.440]  very very early in this hour we're gonna talk about the financial slash military
[02:08:20.440 --> 02:08:25.800]  operations of the private banking cartel they stage terror attacks as a pretext
[02:08:25.800 --> 02:08:32.400]  to put their police state grid in place and they stage financial collapse to get
[02:08:32.400 --> 02:08:36.760]  countries deeper into debt to them until they're fully bankrupt then they have to
[02:08:36.760 --> 02:08:40.600]  adopt all the laws and regulations that the banks order them to put into place
[02:08:40.600 --> 02:08:46.000]  and the number one law is one-child policy so this is a scientific
[02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:49.400]  dictatorship we'll be talking about Greece and a lot more plus the
[02:08:49.400 --> 02:08:53.640]  Democrats all over television all over radio in the White House calling for the
[02:08:53.640 --> 02:08:57.880]  Cyber Security Act calling for banning free speech calling for taking Rush
[02:08:57.880 --> 02:09:01.760]  Limbaugh off the radio saying they can have their political views but he can't
[02:09:01.760 --> 02:09:05.520]  have his now I don't like Ed Schultz I don't like a lot of stuff Rush Limbaugh
[02:09:05.520 --> 02:09:09.680]  does either they're both establishment phonies if you ask me but Limbaugh is
[02:09:09.680 --> 02:09:13.160]  starting to change a little bit and saying world government's real they may
[02:09:13.160 --> 02:09:17.680]  suspend the election Obama may stage a crisis and now they're really talking
[02:09:17.680 --> 02:09:21.360]  about going after him and the reason Limbaugh is being allowed to do this is
[02:09:21.360 --> 02:09:26.360]  you've got a nouveau riche and new wealth power structure that is starting to
[02:09:26.360 --> 02:09:29.880]  realize they're not going to be at the top of the pyramid and they're starting
[02:09:29.880 --> 02:09:34.640]  to realize that this is a hot tyranny and there's a real takeover of the
[02:09:34.640 --> 02:09:38.600]  Republican Party from the grassroots right now and so their listeners are
[02:09:38.600 --> 02:09:44.160]  demanding they tell the truth or they become inconsequential they don't even
[02:09:44.160 --> 02:09:48.440]  matter anymore they're not even pertinent anymore what's the word I'm looking for
[02:09:48.440 --> 02:09:54.640]  you know to stay relevant we are forcing the debate not to the left not to the
[02:09:54.640 --> 02:10:01.320]  right but into real issues of populism and constitutional law and freedom we
[02:10:01.320 --> 02:10:05.760]  are going into bondage right now on every front they're moving for amnesty the
[02:10:05.760 --> 02:10:12.080]  carbon taxes the open borders the police state the north com the naked body
[02:10:12.080 --> 02:10:15.320]  scanners to be in mobile trucks on the streets being announced by homeland
[02:10:15.320 --> 02:10:19.520]  security they're moving right now because they know they're behind schedule
[02:10:19.520 --> 02:10:24.440]  and people are waking up so don't be depressed out there get fired up get

[02:12:07.600 --> 02:12:12.080]  money for the banks the IRS is their collection agency to be their mafia
[02:12:12.080 --> 02:12:15.400]  enforcer to come to your door to collect it to run your bank account to take

[02:12:27.440 --> 02:12:31.640]  Brazil let's take him and then we'll go into that other stuff and that very
[02:12:31.640 --> 02:12:36.160]  smart lady that you just had on a few minutes ago okay let's talk to Tim in
[02:12:36.160 --> 02:12:40.760]  Brazil Tim you're on the air Alex Jones Bob Chapman nice to talk to you guys
[02:12:40.760 --> 02:12:46.280]  I'm a big fan my name's tenacious Tim Anderson I'm a professional wrestler on
[02:12:46.280 --> 02:12:52.120]  tour actually here in Brazil I live in Sao Paulo wanted to call and let you
[02:12:52.120 --> 02:12:57.320]  guys here what's going on down here Alex Jones is not joking around with this
[02:12:57.320 --> 02:13:03.240]  this world banking cartel on their police state I experience it every day of
[02:13:03.240 --> 02:13:11.080]  my life traveling these guys the military police are all over the city
[02:13:11.080 --> 02:13:16.840]  streets where I live they like to intimidate people a lot the public
[02:13:16.840 --> 02:13:22.760]  here it has a very very standoffish type of attitude with the government here
[02:13:22.760 --> 02:13:27.040]  they're very scared of the government here and the tax here is incredible at
[02:13:27.040 --> 02:13:33.080]  30% of importation so you pay whatever you paid to import something and then
[02:13:33.080 --> 02:13:37.960]  you pay 30% tax on top of that on top of that you know the Brazilian
[02:13:37.960 --> 02:13:41.720]  government is trying to act like they have you know kind of a struggle with
[02:13:41.720 --> 02:13:48.160]  US foreign relations ties and really all it is is I live here I know what's
[02:13:48.160 --> 02:13:53.560]  going on I see it they're actually you and they're using UN and US foreign
[02:13:53.560 --> 02:13:58.680]  policy right now to enforce this police state oh absolutely they I mean the so
[02:13:58.680 --> 02:14:02.760]  called leftist down there are all in bed with the IMF and World Bank anything
[02:14:02.760 --> 02:14:08.800]  else Tim no that's it you got to have a nice day and places like Argentina Brazil
[02:14:08.800 --> 02:14:13.520]  were much more wealthy much more free the IMF World Bank comes in they pay off
[02:14:13.520 --> 02:14:18.280]  your politicians to not pay back the debt you can only spend the IMF and
[02:14:18.280 --> 02:14:21.920]  World Bank money on what they tell you you could spend it on that's with their
[02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:28.400]  companies that they own Bob Chapman well first of all it wasn't too long ago I
[02:14:28.400 --> 02:14:34.960]  was in Brazil and what he says is true and Argentina is just as bad and now of
[02:14:34.960 --> 02:14:40.080]  course down across the river plot in Uruguay a month of a deal they have a
[02:14:40.080 --> 02:14:46.280]  new Marxist president and so South America's kind of had in the wrong
[02:14:46.280 --> 02:14:51.840]  direction but be as it may I'd like to hear foreign ideas and we got them from
[02:14:51.840 --> 02:14:58.360]  Tim and thank you Tim the young lady who was on just before you get off talking
[02:14:58.360 --> 02:15:05.320]  about what was going on in the bond and bill and note of the Treasury market
[02:15:05.320 --> 02:15:12.120]  last year I backed into what I think is the privately owned Frederick
[02:15:12.120 --> 02:15:17.800]  Federal Reserve purchasing 80% of US Treasury paper now that's enormous
[02:15:17.800 --> 02:15:21.800]  because the Fed has to create money out of thin air in order to do that and it
[02:15:21.800 --> 02:15:27.000]  goes right into the system via the Treasury bonds which are the proceeds
[02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:30.920]  of which are sold immediately and it tends to be very inflationary and we're
[02:15:30.920 --> 02:15:37.560]  going to see that probably in the next six months the they had two Treasury
[02:15:37.560 --> 02:15:43.720]  sales this week the first one was bills which is 44 billion the second was a
[02:15:43.720 --> 02:15:49.800]  seven-year notes which was 32 billion they're averaging about 50 billion a
[02:15:49.800 --> 02:15:55.280]  week I mean this is incredible just incredibly amount of money and they
[02:15:55.280 --> 02:15:59.200]  having a hard time selling it otherwise the Fed wouldn't be buying some of the
[02:15:59.200 --> 02:16:04.160]  majority of the paper and the real concern out there finally finally it's
[02:16:04.160 --> 02:16:12.920]  dawning on everybody else that global debt by government is at astronomical
[02:16:12.920 --> 02:16:17.600]  levels is 19 countries that are on the verge of bankruptcy which includes the
[02:16:17.600 --> 02:16:22.080]  United States and Great Britain and as I said the way before last on the
[02:16:22.080 --> 02:16:26.880]  program where this is headed is I think late next year they're going to have a
[02:16:26.880 --> 02:16:31.760]  meeting all the countries will attend they will devalue all the currencies
[02:16:31.760 --> 02:16:38.080]  they will be multilaterally default and I think from there will go into a
[02:16:38.080 --> 02:16:44.680]  deflationary depression so it's not too far away now and and so that was in
[02:16:44.680 --> 02:16:50.840]  answer to what she had to what she asked and what she had to say I know that
[02:16:50.840 --> 02:16:56.960]  Bill Goss over at Kimco which is the largest bond manager in the world said
[02:16:56.960 --> 02:17:04.400]  that the three a decade bond market in a bull market in bonds is over and a
[02:17:04.400 --> 02:17:11.080]  little known thing that's come up very important and back financial is selling
[02:17:11.080 --> 02:17:17.200]  for 66 cents a share they are a bond insurer and what they would do is it
[02:17:17.200 --> 02:17:22.840]  was really a scam what they would do is they would go to municipalities and
[02:17:22.840 --> 02:17:27.160]  say look we have a triple A rating and you get a triple B and if you come with
[02:17:27.160 --> 02:17:31.080]  us and let us ensure your bonds what will happen is you get the triple A
[02:17:31.080 --> 02:17:36.440]  rating and you'll pay less money and of course you'll pay a fee to us just like
[02:17:36.440 --> 02:17:41.560]  the rating agencies S&P Moody's Fitch they do the same thing only in the
[02:17:41.560 --> 02:17:46.160]  different area and you saw the results of that with the collateralized debt
[02:17:46.160 --> 02:17:51.240]  obligations in the trillions of dollars of losses that were caused by the mis
[02:17:51.240 --> 02:17:56.120]  rating of those bonds okay Bob Bob let me just stop there so in layman's terms
[02:17:56.120 --> 02:18:02.000]  the IMF World Bank just front companies for the private central banks they go
[02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:06.200]  pay off governments to buy derivatives that they know we're gonna go belly up
[02:18:06.200 --> 02:18:12.160]  but but as it's going up they take the real assets and the profits they've
[02:18:12.160 --> 02:18:16.360]  made from the fraud they invest them in infrastructure then when things go down
[02:18:16.360 --> 02:18:21.720]  they come in and loan the money they've got from taxpayers back to the nation to
[02:18:21.720 --> 02:18:26.920]  then expand the debt and dependency even more and it just goes in cycles so the
[02:18:26.920 --> 02:18:31.120]  entire society collapses the private central banks come in sees the roads
[02:18:31.120 --> 02:18:37.880]  the national parks the resources the water they raise all the taxes we know
[02:18:37.880 --> 02:18:43.320]  the program but I want to come back from break and get into Bloomberg failed
[02:18:43.320 --> 02:18:48.440]  banks may get pension fund backing as FDIC seeks cash now you talked about this
[02:18:48.440 --> 02:18:53.280]  a year ago Bush changed the law five years ago where they can take people's
[02:18:53.280 --> 02:18:58.040]  pension funds and private industry can take it not pay you back government can
[02:18:58.040 --> 02:19:01.800]  take it so I want to talk about how they're basically ordering mainly
[02:19:01.800 --> 02:19:06.880]  government pension funds fire police state federal and they admit to quote
[02:19:06.880 --> 02:19:10.840]  sure up banks the banks don't need sureing up this is part of a criminal
[02:19:10.840 --> 02:19:14.760]  operation I want to get your take on that then I want to talk about health
[02:19:14.760 --> 02:19:19.720]  care with Bob Chapman and your analysis of the health care bill and the biggest

[02:19:26.680 --> 02:19:30.600]  after we talk about the health care bill going after the pensions the IRS

[02:24:05.720 --> 02:24:12.480]  final financial takeover of the planet publicly how is it going for them in
[02:24:12.480 --> 02:24:16.920]  Greece the IMF is coming in even the Financial Times of London admits this is
[02:24:16.920 --> 02:24:21.680]  a robbery a scam just getting a more in debt again they lobby for more
[02:24:21.680 --> 02:24:24.360]  government the country goes bankrupt then they come in and say here's more
[02:24:24.360 --> 02:24:29.240]  loans raise more government your take on the health care bill where all this is
[02:24:29.240 --> 02:24:39.600]  going Bob Chapman I would start off with the the the situation in Greece 10 12
[02:24:39.600 --> 02:24:46.000]  years ago everybody in Europe knew Greece and Italy couldn't qualify for the
[02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:52.840]  Eurozone Eurozone at that time was 14 nations now at 16 and is 27 nations in
[02:24:52.840 --> 02:24:58.320]  the European Union so you people understand and so they knew this was a
[02:24:58.320 --> 02:25:04.960]  problem all along now why did they pick this spot that essentially pulled the
[02:25:04.960 --> 02:25:11.880]  plug on Greece I think the reason is that they are going to ratchet up and into
[02:25:11.880 --> 02:25:18.640]  a new plan a new mode of operation and what they're going to do is I mentioned
[02:25:18.640 --> 02:25:24.600]  earlier there's 19 countries major countries that are in our close to
[02:25:24.600 --> 02:25:31.680]  bankruptcy maybe here a year and a half from now two years we're going to see
[02:25:31.680 --> 02:25:37.640]  the big meeting I described the devaluation of currencies and so on
[02:25:37.640 --> 02:25:44.000]  the the Greece thing is a lead-in to that this is to get the ball rolling in
[02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:49.400]  that direction when they when they do that when they finalize it with all of
[02:25:49.400 --> 02:25:54.400]  the nations it'll affect the entire world it'll be followed by a deflation
[02:25:54.400 --> 02:26:02.200]  depression and a war and so what will happen is during that time frame they
[02:26:02.200 --> 02:26:09.400]  will try to use all sorts of ways to implement world government and that
[02:26:09.400 --> 02:26:14.560]  will be their final thrust and we've got to stop them before they get there and
[02:26:14.560 --> 02:26:19.840]  by exposing what they're doing and getting to have to getting them to have
[02:26:19.840 --> 02:26:24.400]  to rush what they're doing is going to put them off balance they're going to make
[02:26:24.400 --> 02:26:29.160]  a lot of mistakes we do have them confused we got them on the run and we
[02:26:29.160 --> 02:26:33.080]  are going to stop them and one of the keys is the next election if we can
[02:26:33.080 --> 02:26:38.160]  throw most of the incumbents out of office irrespective of what party they're
[02:26:38.160 --> 02:26:44.080]  in then we get a shot at it if we get it and it doesn't work it doesn't work
[02:26:44.080 --> 02:26:48.760]  but at least we tried and that's what that's the direction that we're headed
[02:26:48.760 --> 02:26:54.120]  and that's why grief happened and incidentally I know for sure that
[02:26:54.120 --> 02:26:59.880]  Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup and other banks and major brokerage
[02:26:59.880 --> 02:27:06.400]  houses were all long to dollar between 74 and 76 on the USDX it's trading up
[02:27:06.400 --> 02:27:12.200]  close to 81 82 right now and they knew what was going on they had inside
[02:27:12.200 --> 02:27:16.840]  information and of course nothing will ever be done about it and incidentally
[02:27:16.840 --> 02:27:21.880]  at the same time they shorted gold and silver and the forex in the comics
[02:27:21.880 --> 02:27:27.960]  market as well as the LBMA in London and they also shorted the major gold stocks
[02:27:27.960 --> 02:27:32.160]  because we track all that stuff but it's like a beach ball they shove it down
[02:27:32.160 --> 02:27:36.040]  it's gonna pop right back up and gold is starting to pop back up today where do
[02:27:36.040 --> 02:27:44.720]  you see it going no we'll go back up and test 11 20 11 25 and if it gets through
[02:27:44.720 --> 02:27:52.640]  there bingo it's up retesting 12 24 12 20 wherever that high was are you saying
[02:27:52.640 --> 02:27:57.520]  you believe that's gonna happen soon it could very well it's hard to say it all
[02:27:57.520 --> 02:28:02.960]  depends on what they do we have the gold option contract expiry behind us today
[02:28:02.960 --> 02:28:07.520]  and yesterday so the government is always going to come in with good
[02:28:07.520 --> 02:28:11.680]  derivatives into that bullion market gold and silver and they're going to
[02:28:11.680 --> 02:28:17.320]  continue to try to try to suppress that market from time to time but they can't
[02:28:17.320 --> 02:28:21.400]  hold it down anymore than three or four days of the time and it pops right back
[02:28:21.400 --> 02:28:25.280]  up again just like you just explained all right we're gonna go to break in a
[02:28:25.280 --> 02:28:30.680]  moment but let's get started now your boil down on the health care bill I mean
[02:28:30.680 --> 02:28:34.440]  it openly cuts Medicare and Medicaid it doesn't cover pre-existing conditions
[02:28:34.440 --> 02:28:38.680]  that's even in the Associated Press many members of Congress and the executive
[02:28:38.680 --> 02:28:46.680]  are selectively named to be exempt from it it's totally unconstitutional why
[02:28:46.680 --> 02:28:50.240]  are they passing the health care I mean clearly the bank stocks are up the
[02:28:50.240 --> 02:28:54.720]  insurance company stocks are up they wrote the stinking thing your take on the
[02:28:54.720 --> 02:29:01.640]  health care takeover first and foremost it's people control they could
[02:29:01.640 --> 02:29:06.760]  control your lives by controlling your medical care and if your Bob Chapman or
[02:29:06.760 --> 02:29:12.080]  Alex Jones and you go and you have an appendicitis attack and they're deciding
[02:29:12.080 --> 02:29:18.200]  whether to operate or not they probably won't and that's the reality down the
[02:29:18.200 --> 02:29:24.600]  road of what's going to happen but it's people control and financially things
[02:29:24.600 --> 02:29:29.680]  to add or to come back and talk about it and financially it's a whole new tax
[02:29:29.680 --> 02:29:34.200]  system to the insurance companies it's a bailout as the media has called it to
[02:29:34.200 --> 02:29:40.960]  the insurance company it's not a bailout it's a criminal consolidation we'll talk
[02:29:40.960 --> 02:29:46.080]  about this more take your phone calls straight ahead we'll be right back
[02:29:46.080 --> 02:29:55.400]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[02:29:56.960 --> 02:30:01.800]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[02:30:01.800 --> 02:30:06.360]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[02:30:06.360 --> 02:30:10.320]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home I've
[02:30:10.320 --> 02:30:15.360]  tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[02:30:15.360 --> 02:30:20.640]  the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[02:30:20.640 --> 02:30:25.160]  attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[02:30:25.160 --> 02:30:29.840]  offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[02:30:29.840 --> 02:30:33.520]  constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists
[02:30:33.520 --> 02:30:37.040]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[02:30:37.040 --> 02:30:42.280]  checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we
[02:30:42.280 --> 02:30:48.280]  have seen a fall of the Republic get your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at

[02:31:55.280 --> 02:31:59.600]  hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing
[02:31:59.600 --> 02:32:03.320]  non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you
[02:32:03.320 --> 02:32:06.880]  know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than
[02:32:06.880 --> 02:32:10.640]  silver or gold it's true seeds about perform even gold and silver before in
[02:32:10.640 --> 02:32:14.520]  this country and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends at

[02:32:51.400 --> 02:33:17.720]  ultimate barter item this is Alex Jones for survival seed bank dot com
[02:33:17.720 --> 02:33:24.840]  everything is misdirection and deception with the corporate media they
[02:33:24.840 --> 02:33:31.880]  create false debates about should we give free health care to children or is it
[02:33:31.880 --> 02:33:37.440]  wrong to be collectivist when this is just the IRS the private collection
[02:33:37.440 --> 02:33:42.880]  agency for the Federal Reserve getting into our lives taking over our bank
[02:33:42.880 --> 02:33:48.360]  accounts garnishing our wages raising taxes on everybody and lowering the
[02:33:48.360 --> 02:33:51.120]  standard of care for the insurance companies that's why all their major
[02:33:51.120 --> 02:33:56.000]  stocks are way up right now they wrote the bill and the public knew that it
[02:33:56.000 --> 02:34:02.200]  would never past the Democrats have this idea of wealth transfer and getting the
[02:34:02.200 --> 02:34:07.000]  rich people if you can explain to these numbskulls that the big banks that own
[02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:10.480]  the insurance companies wrote this we have a chance of defeating it in the
[02:34:10.480 --> 02:34:14.520]  future but if we let the Republican Party handle it you watch they're gonna
[02:34:14.520 --> 02:34:19.040]  keep almost all of it in place because the same insurance companies finance
[02:34:19.040 --> 02:34:25.400]  them we have to start identifying the banking dictatorship openly being set
[02:34:25.400 --> 02:34:30.360]  up there's no debate about this even all the major financial publications
[02:34:30.360 --> 02:34:35.200]  dryly admit this information but like it's a good thing Bob Chapman looking at
[02:34:35.200 --> 02:34:40.160]  other areas of the health care bill we always talk about this huge awakening
[02:34:40.160 --> 02:34:45.800]  that's happening and it is happening but I think this is really getting a lot of
[02:34:45.800 --> 02:34:50.800]  people off the bench a lot of people off the fence to realize that we're not in
[02:34:50.800 --> 02:34:57.360]  Kansas anymore these guys are going for broke and they have to their point of no
[02:34:57.360 --> 02:35:03.680]  return was June of two 003 they got to go for it and they are going to lose no
[02:35:03.680 --> 02:35:08.440]  matter which way they go and I think they're starting to realize this and you
[02:35:08.440 --> 02:35:12.680]  know in the olden days they used to banish them to another country and it
[02:35:12.680 --> 02:35:16.760]  would take them they're not going to have that luxury this time the main
[02:35:16.760 --> 02:35:21.680]  things in that bill which we've discussed discussed here before in the
[02:35:21.680 --> 02:35:27.680]  program as the aspects of euthanasia of course they didn't talk about that but
[02:35:27.680 --> 02:35:30.760]  anybody with chronic diseases they'll they'll get rid of them but they won't
[02:35:30.760 --> 02:35:36.040]  treat them and the old people who get ill you know they're going to give them
[02:35:36.040 --> 02:35:40.000]  an option do you want to die now or do we take your medicine away and you suffer
[02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:42.480]  for the next year and a half
[02:35:42.480 --> 02:35:48.080]  secondly at the beginning of next year the insurance will have to be covered
[02:35:48.080 --> 02:35:53.640]  for employees and this is going to be devastating for small insurance for
[02:35:53.640 --> 02:35:59.880]  small companies throughout America that produce 80% of all the jobs created in
[02:35:59.880 --> 02:36:07.880]  our country and so there's going to be a big jump in unemployment next year as
[02:36:07.880 --> 02:36:13.520]  these countries go companies go out of business and their workers are thrown
[02:36:13.520 --> 02:36:19.200]  upon the unemployment rolls and so that's another large factor we don't have
[02:36:19.200 --> 02:36:25.200]  any clue of all the details that are in there yet and we don't know what it's
[02:36:25.200 --> 02:36:30.160]  going to cost now as I told you before the Treasury is having a heck of a time
[02:36:30.160 --> 02:36:38.680]  and has had for the last year or more selling their bonds now the money that's
[02:36:38.680 --> 02:36:44.600]  going to come to finance this deficit spending for this medical bill is going
[02:36:44.600 --> 02:36:48.320]  to have to come from the Treasury which is going to have to go out and ask people
[02:36:48.320 --> 02:36:54.880]  to buy their paper and they having a hard enough time now doing it now that's
[02:36:54.880 --> 02:37:00.080]  why and I gotta ask you a question here Alex did you see the trial balloon that
[02:37:00.080 --> 02:37:07.240]  was set up yesterday in regard to the service employees union yes I did and I
[02:37:07.240 --> 02:37:10.800]  did you talk about it on the air of course I don't listen to you because I'm
[02:37:10.800 --> 02:37:16.080]  doing all these other shows but no no here is that they want to roll the
[02:37:16.080 --> 02:37:22.480]  pension plan of the people who are in the service union into the US Treasury and
[02:37:22.480 --> 02:37:29.600]  get this guaranteed annuity that they would be offering and so what they're
[02:37:29.600 --> 02:37:36.640]  doing here is breaking the ice toward funding the government with people's
[02:37:36.640 --> 02:37:42.480]  collateral or money and so that the government doesn't go bankrupt well Bob
[02:37:42.480 --> 02:37:47.200]  let me stop you because this is really wild you're not sitting here in studio
[02:37:47.200 --> 02:37:52.040]  you're not watching us on prisonplanet.tv you're on the phone with us and my
[02:37:52.040 --> 02:37:56.560]  next question was an article I've been covering for a week and a half failed
[02:37:56.560 --> 02:38:04.240]  banks may get pension fund backing as FDIC seeks cash Bloomberg and next hour
[02:38:04.240 --> 02:38:06.640]  is I want to go to some calls here in a few minutes you're gonna be with us for
[02:38:06.640 --> 02:38:11.640]  20 minutes the next hour I want to start the next hour really detailing the
[02:38:11.640 --> 02:38:15.440]  point you just brought up and I did see the union report that was just piece
[02:38:15.440 --> 02:38:20.080]  meal how the unions think Obama's their sweetie pie and he wouldn't hurt him and
[02:38:20.080 --> 02:38:23.160]  he loves them they don't know he's gonna take them behind the shack and strangle
[02:38:23.160 --> 02:38:26.640]  them you know it's like a dog looking up at its master not knowing the dogs
[02:38:26.640 --> 02:38:33.240]  about to be shot between the eyes they calmly are saying private pension funds
[02:38:33.240 --> 02:38:39.280]  government pension funds state unions teacher unions are going to be given to
[02:38:39.280 --> 02:38:47.000]  the banks this is now being put out as a trial balloon very calmly and so they
[02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:52.120]  already stole 28 trillion with the banker takeover in the US alone 50 trillion
[02:38:52.120 --> 02:38:57.160]  worldwide total in the last year and a half and now they've already gotten to
[02:38:57.160 --> 02:39:03.880]  the point of saying next we want your pension funds and they're telling well
[02:39:03.880 --> 02:39:07.800]  you know two months ago the feds changed the regulations without even passing a
[02:39:07.800 --> 02:39:12.680]  law to say that your money markets which are most savings accounts aren't
[02:39:12.680 --> 02:39:18.400]  protected by the FDIC so all the evidence is they are getting ready for
[02:39:18.400 --> 02:39:22.840]  some type of banking collapse so next hour I want to just have give you the
[02:39:22.840 --> 02:39:26.320]  floor after I read part of these articles on errors people know this isn't
[02:39:26.320 --> 02:39:33.200]  just me saying this so you can break down how you see this unfolding but I do
[02:39:33.200 --> 02:39:38.560]  want to go to calls here in just a moment but before we get into all the
[02:39:38.560 --> 02:39:44.680]  mechanics and the meat of this bob Chapman specifically what is the time
[02:39:44.680 --> 02:39:50.360]  frame for the collapse that you see I think by the end of next year now it's
[02:39:50.360 --> 02:39:56.680]  so hard to try to put a time on things we discussed this before with mr. Roberts
[02:39:56.680 --> 02:40:00.880]  and but it appears it's accelerating it appears it's accelerating is there's no
[02:40:00.880 --> 02:40:04.880]  question and that's what Greece was all about and of course they made a
[02:40:04.880 --> 02:40:09.920]  fortune out of that debate by being long the dollar and they weren't successful
[02:40:09.920 --> 02:40:17.520]  in shorting gold in the shares but when we get to that in the next hour I have
[02:40:17.520 --> 02:40:21.920]  something to tell the audience that I've reported in the international
[02:40:21.920 --> 02:40:27.200]  forecast of this week and some of my contacts within the banking industry
[02:40:27.200 --> 02:40:35.120]  one of whom attends Federal Reserve meetings so some powerful inside info
[02:40:35.120 --> 02:40:41.800]  coming up with Bob Chapman in t-minus 20 minutes but right now I wanted just for
[02:40:41.800 --> 02:40:44.240]  two or three minutes to bring Ted Anderson up and then we're gonna go to
[02:40:44.240 --> 02:40:50.320]  Tim David Bobby Randy Doug and others that are holding but I just want to make
[02:40:50.320 --> 02:40:57.320]  this point right now when Bob says they've passed the point of no return I
[02:40:57.320 --> 02:41:01.520]  think they passed it in 99 with the repeal of Glass-Steagall but he's right
[02:41:01.520 --> 02:41:06.440]  and saying it took him an additional three and a half years to pump up the
[02:41:06.440 --> 02:41:12.800]  now 1.5 quadrillion mega derivatives bubble thousands of times all the real
[02:41:12.800 --> 02:41:17.720]  assets in the world they've created this Ponzi scheme so big that either they
[02:41:17.720 --> 02:41:25.040]  take over the world with it or they are destroyed they this is a winter lose
[02:41:25.040 --> 02:41:29.800]  proposition all their chips are in they have passed the point of no return
[02:41:29.800 --> 02:41:36.240]  there's no backing off for them this is an all or nothing situation and so
[02:41:36.240 --> 02:41:39.720]  they're going to attach all the green taxes on the city's counties and states
[02:41:39.720 --> 02:41:43.240]  they're going to pass the health care bills they're gonna raise other taxes
[02:41:43.240 --> 02:41:47.680]  they're going to attempt total amnesty overrun the country let the
[02:41:47.680 --> 02:41:52.040]  illegals vote as a political weapon against whoever's left in the nation
[02:41:52.040 --> 02:41:56.360]  who could still you know rub two brain cells together so it's all coming down
[02:41:56.360 --> 02:42:00.960]  now this is the final battle the next five years or so and it's gonna be
[02:42:00.960 --> 02:42:05.720]  staged terror attacks new wars they're gonna be arresting citizens and
[02:42:05.720 --> 02:42:09.560]  torturing them they've got bills to openly do it I had judged a politano on
[02:42:09.560 --> 02:42:15.480]  yesterday documenting that this is so unspeakable what is going on now I want
[02:42:15.480 --> 02:42:20.000]  to bring Ted up here briefly because gold's back up Ted still has gold from
[02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:25.840]  the $1,050 level with it above $1,100 right now or right up there and you get
[02:42:25.840 --> 02:42:30.040]  a free international forecaster either hard copy or digital version when you
[02:42:30.040 --> 02:42:35.400]  do this and it's invaluable info plus you get a Frank a European Frank a fifth
[02:42:35.400 --> 02:42:40.520]  of an ounce gold coin at a price no one else anywhere can offer I've seen no
[02:42:40.520 --> 02:42:45.040]  deals this good and yeah this is our sponsor it funds the operation but I
[02:42:45.040 --> 02:42:51.240]  also believe in it and I want my listeners to be positioned it's not a
[02:42:51.240 --> 02:42:56.040]  silver bullet but silver and gold is the closest thing to it you need to start
[02:42:56.040 --> 02:43:01.120]  getting out at least partially out of paper money and paper assets because
[02:43:01.120 --> 02:43:07.480]  these made-off people these can lay types that are running things this is how
[02:43:07.480 --> 02:43:11.880]  they get you so desperate so set up in the system that every new crisis they
[02:43:11.880 --> 02:43:15.960]  say well your 401k is going down we got to raise taxes but this will pump it
[02:43:15.960 --> 02:43:19.920]  back up and then you lose a lot but you get some of it back and then they take
[02:43:19.920 --> 02:43:25.040]  even more and then they give you some back this is the whole slave mindset
[02:43:25.040 --> 02:43:31.480]  Ted Anderson briefly tell folks about today's awesome offers well Alex the
[02:43:31.480 --> 02:43:36.440]  one that you touched on the Frank at 261 61 you're gonna get us you're gonna
[02:43:36.440 --> 02:43:41.120]  get a Swiss French Frank it's European it's a fifth of an ounce of gold and
[02:43:41.120 --> 02:43:45.480]  you're gonna get a subscription to the international forecaster that goes for
[02:43:45.480 --> 02:43:49.760]  $159 and when you consider the discount because you're getting that
[02:43:49.760 --> 02:43:55.000]  subscription it brings gold all the way down to $520 an ounce so try
[02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:58.640]  to get that anywhere else in the marketplace obviously it's a great buy
[02:43:58.640 --> 02:44:04.120]  say the Montana silvers have completely sold out they're manufacturing me more
[02:44:04.120 --> 02:44:07.600]  you can't get them anywhere right now but they came up with a coin that was
[02:44:07.600 --> 02:44:12.720]  really interesting that I do have right now that's the the silver sovereign 1
[02:44:12.720 --> 02:44:16.600]  ounce half ounce quarter ounce and they even make a coin that's as small as a
[02:44:16.600 --> 02:44:20.880]  tenth of an ounce now if you want to see those coins you can go to one of our
[02:44:20.880 --> 02:44:25.040]  offers on info wars dot com and just click on one of the Midas links it'll
[02:44:25.040 --> 02:44:29.920]  take you right to it but it is just an interesting thing beautiful coin again
[02:44:29.920 --> 02:44:34.960]  it's all about sovereignty of that Montana organization over there I love
[02:44:34.960 --> 02:44:38.920]  the Montana silver coins I really love this coin as well I think it's a great
[02:44:38.920 --> 02:44:44.840]  coin to be getting into gold is up gold went up $13 and 60 cents today seen a
[02:44:44.840 --> 02:44:49.920]  high today of about 1007 so yeah it's it's strong and it's no no doubt that
[02:44:49.920 --> 02:44:54.640]  gold is going to be doing well because unfortunately our political environment
[02:44:54.640 --> 02:45:00.360]  is destroying the United States currency tend to be specific what is gold's
[02:45:00.360 --> 02:45:09.120]  exact price right now right now gold is currently at 1100 560 presently okay so
[02:45:09.120 --> 02:45:12.120]  it's gone up quite a bit in a few days despite the fact that they tried to drive

[02:45:47.080 --> 02:45:51.480]  air with Bob Chapman go ahead Tim good afternoon gentlemen three brief
[02:45:51.480 --> 02:45:54.600]  statements concerning this pre-soil and green statements that were in and a
[02:45:54.600 --> 02:45:59.720]  quick question for Bob number one semantics Alex to Toro to Toro to Toro
[02:45:59.720 --> 02:46:03.280]  put a big sign in front of your microphone I keep calling in Barack
[02:46:03.280 --> 02:46:09.760]  Obama we must all change and and say our fraudulent president Barry Sataro
[02:46:09.760 --> 02:46:14.400]  Indonesian citizen not even a birth certificate issue he is an Indonesian
[02:46:14.400 --> 02:46:20.880]  citizen was adopted there he is a fraud Barry Sataro aka Barack Obama I've been
[02:46:20.880 --> 02:46:24.960]  putting signs up all over my town that they wanted for treason Barry Sataro
[02:46:24.960 --> 02:46:30.400]  aka Barack Obama and the Barack Obama crimes.com by the way we're coming out
[02:46:30.400 --> 02:46:36.360]  with a Barry Sataro t-shirt that has a picture of aka Barack Obama on it so
[02:46:36.360 --> 02:46:39.720]  that'll be the that'll be a hot way to get the end he'll say Barry Sataro
[02:46:39.720 --> 02:46:43.840]  that's Obama you'll be able to and listen they can't stop the people as a
[02:46:43.840 --> 02:46:48.200]  protest to healthcare to tell the truth about him the idea of everyone calling
[02:46:48.200 --> 02:46:52.720]  him Barry Sataro and the way it opens up discussions and talk this can bring him
[02:46:52.720 --> 02:46:56.920]  down he's a figurehead but it will but if we can get him to basically end up
[02:46:56.920 --> 02:47:03.760]  going to prison for what about all the congressman is and others we'll call for
[02:47:03.760 --> 02:47:09.240]  special prosecutor to investigate White House bribery quid quo pro we know this
[02:47:09.240 --> 02:47:15.240]  is illegal how they got these votes Bob Chavin oh that's right and we will be
[02:47:15.240 --> 02:47:19.560]  able to do something about it our time will come
[02:47:22.080 --> 02:47:27.440]  well said Bob anything else Tim yes let's go back to the semantics real quick
[02:47:27.440 --> 02:47:32.880]  look what you're dealing with politics poly many ticks bloodsucking creatures
[02:47:32.880 --> 02:47:39.480]  wake up people also with the census all the senses are addressed to resident what
[02:47:39.480 --> 02:47:44.320]  is a res in latin root words but property res means property ident means
[02:47:44.320 --> 02:47:49.400]  identified don't identify yourself look at how they call your employees human
[02:47:49.400 --> 02:47:53.880]  resources we are resources of the elite Tim I appreciate your call Bob any
[02:47:53.880 --> 02:47:59.600]  comments on what Tim was saying he's right on the ball that's for sure David in
[02:47:59.600 --> 02:48:06.560]  Washington you're on the air go ahead yeah Alex first-time caller my wife and
[02:48:06.560 --> 02:48:12.560]  I pray for you and your family every day thank you I've got three quick
[02:48:12.560 --> 02:48:19.760]  observations and a talking point the listeners need as we're getting into
[02:48:19.760 --> 02:48:26.120]  this thickens we need constructive solutions besides the videos and you
[02:48:26.120 --> 02:48:31.440]  know talking points and how to organize locally and communicate with people in
[02:48:31.440 --> 02:48:35.420]  your immediate area well David that's all we've been doing and we're gonna get
[02:48:35.420 --> 02:48:40.040]  read Beckman on next week specifically about how to get grand juries to start
[02:48:40.040 --> 02:48:44.120]  criminal proceedings and Judge Napolitano I've been calling for that all
[02:48:44.120 --> 02:48:47.840]  week he separately said that's the way to go have the state's past
[02:48:47.840 --> 02:48:54.040]  notification laws call all your state reps run for state rep you'll point out
[02:48:54.040 --> 02:48:58.240]  how this is illegal the reason we say books and videos is the general public
[02:48:58.240 --> 02:49:01.240]  is still caught up in the left-right paradigm to a certain extent we've got
[02:49:01.240 --> 02:49:05.240]  to unlock them from that to start realizing that puppets come and go the
[02:49:05.240 --> 02:49:10.480]  bankers are the enemy Bob Chapman there's no question about that and they
[02:49:10.480 --> 02:49:16.480]  are the core nucleus than the nexus behind the scenes that are controlling
[02:49:16.480 --> 02:49:20.560]  everything and of course there's a lot of other people besides bankers who are
[02:49:20.560 --> 02:49:24.960]  involved Wall Street insurance transnational corporations the black
[02:49:24.960 --> 02:49:29.440]  nobility of Europe who really run things from behind the scenes and so we
[02:49:29.440 --> 02:49:33.440]  got to bring that to the attention so people understand how this happened how
[02:49:33.440 --> 02:49:37.680]  it evolved and where we think it's going David you got about a minute finish
[02:49:37.680 --> 02:49:44.600]  up really quick I'm concerned about your safety and contingency plans if they if
[02:49:44.600 --> 02:49:51.400]  they do shut you down and I'd like to have some way maybe talk with your
[02:49:51.400 --> 02:49:56.000]  staff about contacting you if I come into any ability to help you
[02:49:56.000 --> 02:50:05.480]  significantly and the I think that the situation in Fairbanks Alaska needs some
[02:50:05.480 --> 02:50:13.520]  exposure but my talking point is this I'll try it really quick 150 years we've
[02:50:13.520 --> 02:50:19.200]  been laboring under this delusion amongst the Christians about a rapture
[02:50:19.200 --> 02:50:24.840]  that's going to take them off to heaven and the whole thing has put the whole
[02:50:24.840 --> 02:50:32.120]  Christian community how many are there 45 million of them to sleep the whole I
[02:50:32.120 --> 02:50:37.160]  know this isn't a religious program but no but you're right the Rockefellers
[02:50:37.160 --> 02:50:40.520]  funded it so that everybody thinks they're gonna be raptured so they don't
[02:50:40.520 --> 02:50:44.960]  fight evil and it's a giant cop out because it was Christians that founded
[02:50:44.960 --> 02:50:48.880]  this country and stood up to tyranny and you've been a really good point more
[02:50:48.880 --> 02:50:53.120]  calls straight ahead and you can always conduct by email David we'll be right

[02:55:05.800 --> 02:55:12.040]  the whole stinking thing you think they'll kill a million plus Iraqis for
[02:55:12.040 --> 02:55:15.720]  some oil and weapons sales and that your life means anything to them you better
[02:55:15.720 --> 02:55:22.000]  grow up all you slobs out there all you I'm talking about fake right-wingers and
[02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:25.320]  left-wingers you people are living on another planet okay I'm living on the
[02:55:25.320 --> 02:55:28.680]  real planet I'm sorry I'm ranting I was just reading how they are gonna take the
[02:55:28.680 --> 02:55:32.640]  401ks next it's all being announced in fact I don't want just the articles
[02:55:32.640 --> 02:55:40.280]  will you try to YouTube Obama talks about putting 401ks into
[02:55:40.280 --> 02:55:44.400]  treasuries now now we know they were proposing this a few months ago and Bob
[02:55:44.400 --> 02:55:48.240]  and I warned you Bob it's one thing to know it's coming it's another thing to
[02:55:48.240 --> 02:55:51.160]  see him doing it it's another thing to see them all over the news saying shut
[02:55:51.160 --> 02:55:55.720]  down free speech it's another I mean I I know you don't get angry your way past
[02:55:55.720 --> 02:56:00.000]  that but it's not even anger with me I'm just sick of it why do we have to let
[02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:05.360]  this happen Bob Chapman why is the public why aren't there more people like us I
[02:56:05.360 --> 02:56:09.300]  don't think I'm some special person I don't want to be a slave I mean what
[02:56:09.300 --> 02:56:13.520]  red-blooded man can let their family go into bondage to a bunch of stinking
[02:56:13.520 --> 02:56:22.840]  chicken-necked bankers it's human nature it's the easy way out and then when
[02:56:22.840 --> 02:56:27.200]  they get there to the stage that we're taking them then they go into a denial
[02:56:27.200 --> 02:56:31.880]  and we have to go that through that process as well and then all of a sudden
[02:56:31.880 --> 02:56:38.840]  one day their houses were closed on and their job is gone they don't have
[02:56:38.840 --> 02:56:43.280]  anything they're in the streets and the only thing the guys got left is a
[02:56:43.280 --> 02:56:50.280]  they are a 15 and 10 30-shot clips ready to go and that that probably is the way
[02:56:50.280 --> 02:56:54.800]  it's gonna end up and we know who he's gonna go after because he's gonna call
[02:56:54.800 --> 02:57:01.960]  up Alex and say who are the bad guys and Alex is gonna send him a list Bob I
[02:57:01.960 --> 02:57:07.840]  am NOT going to send him a list I don't want to get that I pull your tail on
[02:57:07.840 --> 02:57:12.440]  that one but the thing is that that is the process that people are going through
[02:57:12.440 --> 02:57:19.400]  right now and people who have been financially mostly injured they're
[02:57:19.400 --> 02:57:24.920]  starting to perk up and they're listening and there's a lot of people who are
[02:57:24.920 --> 02:57:29.440]  graduating into that and they're gonna talk to other people and it's going to
[02:57:29.440 --> 02:57:34.160]  start to swell over the next couple of years while all of this that we've
[02:57:34.160 --> 02:57:39.120]  discussed earlier is coming down and there will be action we don't know
[02:57:39.120 --> 02:57:44.200]  exactly what form it's going to take maybe the state legislatures will step
[02:57:44.200 --> 02:57:50.240]  in and save us so to speak we don't know all we can do is give the
[02:57:50.240 --> 02:57:55.680]  information to the people as quickly and as best we can through your program
[02:57:55.680 --> 02:58:01.160]  other programs like it and also of course the internet and well Bob let me
[02:58:01.160 --> 02:58:03.960]  throw this out there as we go to break to put a bookend on this that we're
[02:58:03.960 --> 02:58:07.200]  gonna come back take a few more calls in the next segment after that get into the
[02:58:07.200 --> 02:58:12.160]  key news you were just talking about I am for non-violence offensively I believe
[02:58:12.160 --> 02:58:15.840]  we should be able to protect ourselves this is tyranny our forefathers revolted
[02:58:15.840 --> 02:58:21.000]  against much less but the system is pushing and once violence at this
[02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:27.800]  juncture and but this is in Argentina or other countries they've taken over we
[02:58:27.800 --> 02:58:31.760]  do have a hundred and fifty million gun owners and it is not going to go well
[02:58:31.760 --> 02:58:37.400]  for the establishment no matter how many black ski mask goons they employ

[02:59:49.040 --> 02:59:56.000]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio
[02:59:56.000 --> 03:00:08.320]  well it's already the fourth and final hour of this 26th day of March 2010 a
[03:00:08.320 --> 03:00:12.040]  Friday edition Bob Chapman with us for another 20 minutes the International
[03:00:12.040 --> 03:00:19.240]  Forecaster.com I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv and we're
[03:00:19.240 --> 03:00:22.160]  gonna go to a few more of your phone calls here in a moment and when Bob
[03:00:22.160 --> 03:00:25.440]  believes us I will continue with phone calls and recap a lot of news and cover
[03:00:25.440 --> 03:00:30.400]  some news I got three stacks of it here that I haven't even gotten to yet but
[03:00:30.400 --> 03:00:33.600]  Bob was bringing up the point basically that the system isn't gonna have to
[03:00:33.600 --> 03:00:39.760]  stage terror attacks anybody resisting is being called terrorism it's gonna
[03:00:39.760 --> 03:00:44.720]  happen spontaneously and that's why FEMA teaches that the founding fathers were
[03:00:44.720 --> 03:00:49.560]  terrorist I believe that whoever fires first loses I believe we have a lot of
[03:00:49.560 --> 03:00:54.520]  legislative avenues in the states I know people are waking up 80% against the
[03:00:54.520 --> 03:00:58.960]  health bill they still passed it they're trying amnesty cap and trade we have a
[03:00:58.960 --> 03:01:03.760]  lot of things to exhaust here before things go to the cartridge box and it's
[03:01:03.760 --> 03:01:07.760]  not just the ballot box it's it's it's it's lawsuits it's criminal charges it's
[03:01:07.760 --> 03:01:12.520]  special prosecutors Bob Chapman do you agree with me that whoever fires first
[03:01:12.520 --> 03:01:19.120]  loses absolutely and you know the point I was trying to make there is that
[03:01:19.120 --> 03:01:24.640]  you're going to have disgruntled people deeply disgruntled because they don't
[03:01:24.640 --> 03:01:30.520]  know how to handle what's happened to them and what they have to do is suppress
[03:01:30.520 --> 03:01:37.600]  their desire their their feeling for revenge by not acting unless they shot
[03:01:37.600 --> 03:01:44.200]  at or something they've got to use the avenues that are available to us and
[03:01:44.200 --> 03:01:49.720]  Alex comes up with these ideas and so don't the legislatures those of that's
[03:01:49.720 --> 03:01:55.320]  the road to follow we're a long way for anything like that happening except
[03:01:55.320 --> 03:02:00.240]  perhaps for isolated incidents here and there so what I'm saying here is you
[03:02:00.240 --> 03:02:05.080]  stay out of trouble but it is a big checkmate but it is a big checkmate on
[03:02:05.080 --> 03:02:09.360]  the system Bob that there are 150 million gun owners 400 million guns and
[03:02:09.360 --> 03:02:13.320]  that people can't be pushed too far so that's why they built up this huge
[03:02:13.320 --> 03:02:18.720]  internal security police force that's why they're trying to pass bills to openly
[03:02:18.720 --> 03:02:24.240]  torture US citizens it says in enhanced interrogation for no reason for any
[03:02:24.240 --> 03:02:28.040]  intelligence purposes they wish in fact I want to go back over that bill I know
[03:02:28.040 --> 03:02:31.040]  you print it every day it's moved off the stack print print it one more time
[03:02:31.040 --> 03:02:34.800]  jaren thank you it's a joke around here they made print articles 10 times in one
[03:02:34.800 --> 03:02:42.240]  week but it isn't going to work and these guys in their ivory towers think
[03:02:42.240 --> 03:02:44.880]  they're going to bring some type of Soviet tyranny here and the question is
[03:02:44.880 --> 03:02:50.800]  did the Russians have the right to resist Stalin did the Germans I mean was
[03:02:50.800 --> 03:02:55.000]  it wrong that Germans tried to resist Hitler was it wrong that Chinese tried
[03:02:55.000 --> 03:02:58.800]  to resist Mao and according to our government yes you must worship
[03:02:58.800 --> 03:03:03.840]  government government is always right Bob and that's what they want us to
[03:03:03.840 --> 03:03:11.440]  believe and the tyranny hasn't reached that point yet in Germany they were just
[03:03:11.440 --> 03:03:15.320]  really lulled to sleep because you know they were in a depression and they
[03:03:15.320 --> 03:03:19.680]  needed help and and this guy Hitler he sounded like maybe he could do something
[03:03:19.680 --> 03:03:25.240]  and he really did capture their imagination and their votes as well in
[03:03:25.240 --> 03:03:29.480]  Russia it was a different situation the government was overthrown the first
[03:03:29.480 --> 03:03:35.840]  thing they did was a purge and then they had another purge in 1937 to 1939 of the
[03:03:35.840 --> 03:03:40.040]  officer corps if you may and of course they killed hundreds of millions of
[03:03:40.040 --> 03:03:44.600]  people and you don't hear much about it you hear about what Hitler did but the
[03:03:44.600 --> 03:03:49.680]  Russians were even well the Russian communists were even worse you know
[03:03:49.680 --> 03:03:54.480]  that's a point we need to make in every case in history once a corrupt group
[03:03:54.480 --> 03:03:58.360]  really overthrows a government and starts looting the first group they go
[03:03:58.360 --> 03:04:02.000]  after isn't even the political dissonance they just isolate and ignore
[03:04:02.000 --> 03:04:06.960]  them generally they go after people who know where the bodies are buried they
[03:04:06.960 --> 03:04:12.480]  go after the people that brought them to power absolutely because they can't
[03:04:12.480 --> 03:04:17.000]  have them around putting the finger on them all right Bob we're going to come
[03:04:17.000 --> 03:04:23.160]  back with the key to all this the fact that the banks have now looted you with
[03:04:23.160 --> 03:04:27.240]  the takeover of health care trying to loot you with the carbon taxes raising
[03:04:27.240 --> 03:04:32.520]  all these taxes as the economy literally implodes in on itself and they're now
[03:04:32.520 --> 03:04:37.240]  saying they're gonna take the pension funds and 401ks it's mainstream news
[03:04:37.240 --> 03:04:41.760]  being reported like they're talking about oh there might be light showers this
[03:04:41.760 --> 03:04:49.560]  afternoon or oh they're having a Beagle race down at the park today but they're
[03:04:49.560 --> 03:04:55.360]  announcing it's like announcing space aliens landed calmly one major world

[03:09:20.800 --> 03:09:24.320]  illegitimately they're making agreements with each other right now they've
[03:09:24.320 --> 03:09:28.320]  engineered a financial implosion so big that's meant to give them total power
[03:09:28.320 --> 03:09:32.680]  if they fail they're destroyed in the process so this is an all or nothing
[03:09:32.680 --> 03:09:37.720]  exercise I keep saying that all or nothing for them all or nothing for us
[03:09:37.720 --> 03:09:41.920]  that's why they're announcing censorship of the web the fairness doctrine all
[03:09:41.920 --> 03:09:46.160]  these new taxes IRS running your health care taking your wages carbon taxes
[03:09:46.160 --> 03:09:50.600]  even if the Senate won't pass it they've got to get the money and the big banks
[03:09:50.600 --> 03:09:54.320]  authored the insurance takeover that's what conservative talk show hosts won't
[03:09:54.320 --> 03:09:57.680]  tell you they'll say it's a bunch of communist liberals you know they just
[03:09:57.680 --> 03:10:01.880]  want to give poor people health care no they want to run your life and they
[03:10:01.880 --> 03:10:05.280]  want to cut Medicare and Medicaid while raising taxes to pay the banks we've
[03:10:05.280 --> 03:10:10.160]  seen the IMF and World Bank the XM Bank and these other consortiums in hundreds
[03:10:10.160 --> 03:10:14.680]  of nations and sometimes over and over and over again Argentina Nigeria Greece
[03:10:14.680 --> 03:10:20.720]  Iceland the list goes on and on go in and it normally takes some five phases
[03:10:20.720 --> 03:10:24.720]  over if it's a third world country they can do it quicker a big nation maybe 20
[03:10:24.720 --> 03:10:30.120]  years they they lobby for big government get people in debt with made-up fiat
[03:10:30.120 --> 03:10:38.440]  currency and and and and and loans that are taken from the private central banks
[03:10:38.440 --> 03:10:41.280]  they get the world for nothing as Thomas Jefferson said if you ever let
[03:10:41.280 --> 03:10:44.760]  private banks to control the issuance of currency and credit your children will
[03:10:44.760 --> 03:10:50.360]  wake up homeless on the continent their forefathers conquered okay our country
[03:10:50.360 --> 03:10:55.160]  was founded fighting these people the Civil War was over this Andrew Jackson
[03:10:55.160 --> 03:10:58.240]  fought this so listen to me carefully we're gonna keep Bob the bottom of the
[03:10:58.240 --> 03:11:02.040]  hour here don't give him some time but I've got a lay the groundwork here with
[03:11:02.040 --> 03:11:06.120]  Bob Chapman of international forecaster.com expert one of the best
[03:11:06.120 --> 03:11:09.880]  researchers best trends forecasters we've got so I want him to take the floor
[03:11:09.880 --> 03:11:13.720]  here in just a moment but I want to go over a few of these articles first we
[03:11:13.720 --> 03:11:18.560]  are now entering the next to final phase Greece is entering the final phase of
[03:11:18.560 --> 03:11:22.760]  what they do to third world countries totally imploding them making 99% of the
[03:11:22.760 --> 03:11:28.640]  population totally poor half of them at or near starvation and homeless this is
[03:11:28.640 --> 03:11:34.880]  total economic domination now the IMF and World Bank in the next to final phase
[03:11:34.880 --> 03:11:41.320]  always take over the pension funds in the 401ks first they get the the
[03:11:41.320 --> 03:11:45.600]  companies and governments local federal you name it the teacher funds the police
[03:11:45.600 --> 03:11:49.280]  funds to invest with them in the comprehensive annual financial report
[03:11:49.280 --> 03:11:52.800]  prospectus you want to look it up look it up that's a double set of books the
[03:11:52.800 --> 03:11:58.320]  real set of books Chicago mafia started at the bankers picked it up the 50s once
[03:11:58.320 --> 03:12:04.040]  they've done this this is life or death folks they then take over the pension
[03:12:04.040 --> 03:12:08.800]  funds and start taxing them and only pay you a part of it then in the next phase
[03:12:08.800 --> 03:12:13.000]  they completely take your pension funds and they always put a riot police
[03:12:13.000 --> 03:12:17.720]  surveillance national police force in place before they do it they've been
[03:12:17.720 --> 03:12:21.360]  holding it for 20 years here they now admit the Pentagon's release documents
[03:12:21.360 --> 03:12:24.080]  so is the British Ministry of Defense that they've been getting ready for 20
[03:12:24.080 --> 03:12:28.800]  years for this this is their mass takeover so we're now entering the final
[03:12:28.800 --> 03:12:33.680]  phases of this and it telescopes it accelerates at the end you'll see more
[03:12:33.680 --> 03:12:37.560]  robbing and looting in the next three four years and you've seen the last 80
[03:12:37.560 --> 03:12:48.280]  now here's the two key articles alright social security to see payout exceeded in
[03:12:48.280 --> 03:12:53.880]  pay ends this year they bankrupted it by design that's New York Times here's
[03:12:53.880 --> 03:12:57.440]  another one Wall Street Journal personal income drops across the country we're
[03:12:57.440 --> 03:13:01.320]  in a depression folks not a double-dip recession now here's the key stories
[03:13:01.320 --> 03:13:07.560]  Bloomberg.com failed banks may get pension fund backing as FDIC six cash a year
[03:13:07.560 --> 03:13:12.960]  ago the Federal Reserve and Treasury were talking about this a month ago they
[03:13:12.960 --> 03:13:21.800]  changed the rules to tax and to not ensure your money market accounts they
[03:13:21.800 --> 03:13:25.000]  have told the banks get ready to hold money for seven days while they devalue
[03:13:25.000 --> 03:13:28.600]  Citibank we wrote that article about that drudge picked it up we just found
[03:13:28.600 --> 03:13:32.440]  it on the Citibank website they're now admitting it now listen to this and we're
[03:13:32.440 --> 03:13:37.760]  going to Bob failed banks may get pension fund backing as FDIC six cash
[03:13:37.760 --> 03:13:43.000]  Bloomberg this is a week and a half old the federal deposit insurance core is
[03:13:43.000 --> 03:13:46.840]  trying to encourage public retirement funds that control more than two trillion
[03:13:46.840 --> 03:13:51.400]  to buy all or more of failed lenders now think of how they commonly announce
[03:13:51.400 --> 03:13:58.520]  that take your private pension funds they're already getting the police and
[03:13:58.520 --> 03:14:01.840]  firemen you're in teachers you're gonna be completely robbed and you're gonna
[03:14:01.840 --> 03:14:05.520]  be told in force of police said you'll get nothing this is how they suck you in
[03:14:05.520 --> 03:14:09.080]  and then you never never get out because you keep hoping to get something this is
[03:14:09.080 --> 03:14:14.280]  how they hold you hostage imagine they're calmly announcing and it says the
[03:14:14.280 --> 03:14:17.720]  federal regulators in this article are pressuring them if they don't do it
[03:14:17.720 --> 03:14:22.480]  federal regulators say they can find any nickel or dime crooked toenail to shut
[03:14:22.480 --> 03:14:26.840]  these firms down or arrest or charge their CEO so they're all saying okay
[03:14:26.840 --> 03:14:30.920]  we'll dump the money in that's two trillion in private not counting
[03:14:30.920 --> 03:14:35.800]  government pension funds taking a more direct role in propping up the banking
[03:14:35.800 --> 03:14:40.480]  system said people briefed on the matter so so they're holding you hostage we'll
[03:14:40.480 --> 03:14:44.080]  crash everything if you don't go ahead and give us your money then they take
[03:14:44.080 --> 03:14:48.160]  half of it or more Oregon's retirement fund they contribute 100 million it goes
[03:14:48.160 --> 03:14:52.480]  on from there current rules don't prohibit pension funds from buying failed
[03:14:52.480 --> 03:14:57.080]  banks so they're saying they're gonna invest your money in failed banks then
[03:14:57.080 --> 03:15:00.400]  they take the money out the back door implode the bank and say well you
[03:15:00.400 --> 03:15:06.120]  invested in it here's another one world net daily Obama ally targets 401k
[03:15:06.120 --> 03:15:11.160]  dollars trillions in IRA funds could be forced into u.s. Treasury debt I've been
[03:15:11.160 --> 03:15:15.040]  beating the drum for a week and a half on this now I'm gonna shut up we're gonna
[03:15:15.040 --> 03:15:19.000]  hold Bob till 30 after so the end of this segment the next segment then we'll
[03:15:19.000 --> 03:15:24.240]  come back and take calls but Bob Chapman you've got the floor they really mean on
[03:15:24.240 --> 03:15:29.040]  doing this they intend to do this this this is a we put up with the last fraud
[03:15:29.040 --> 03:15:32.680]  trillion stolen by the Federal Reserve they won't say where the money went to
[03:15:32.680 --> 03:15:35.920]  Congress why not go ahead and take the pension funds they've done it all over
[03:15:35.920 --> 03:15:40.760]  the world they know how to do it they know how to propagandize a why are they
[03:15:40.760 --> 03:15:45.200]  doing it be when are they gonna start doing it and see how do they think they're
[03:15:45.200 --> 03:15:50.280]  gonna get away with it Bob Chapman well about four months ago I came out with
[03:15:50.280 --> 03:15:58.880]  this kind of information and I was summarily attacked for it and and I guess
[03:15:58.880 --> 03:16:05.480]  at the the harbinger the bringer of bad news is always rejected even though the
[03:16:05.480 --> 03:16:15.800]  bad news is the truth the the going forward of the looting of of retirement
[03:16:15.800 --> 03:16:21.200]  plans is still in the planning stage and you're feeling seeing these trial
[03:16:21.200 --> 03:16:26.960]  balloons go up yes we we should turn it all over the government and get that
[03:16:26.960 --> 03:16:30.800]  guaranteed written annuity I don't know how they're going to enter into it at
[03:16:30.800 --> 03:16:38.960]  first it looks like they are going to get enter into something either a voluntary
[03:16:38.960 --> 03:16:45.840]  program or a 5% tax on everybody to be held for you until you retire or whether
[03:16:45.840 --> 03:16:51.640]  it'll be mandatory right away which I don't think it will be then they are as
[03:16:51.640 --> 03:16:59.160]  Alex pointed out getting the public pension funds to get involved in this
[03:16:59.160 --> 03:17:04.280]  program which I explained earlier it's just a prop up a system that is
[03:17:04.280 --> 03:17:10.720]  collapsing I've learned other things along the way about four months ago we
[03:17:10.720 --> 03:17:16.360]  said that at the end of the year or next year FDIC will be broke and
[03:17:16.360 --> 03:17:21.720]  government will not come in and lend them five hundred billion dollars or
[03:17:21.720 --> 03:17:28.880]  whatever it is to keep them afloat the reason is they don't want the savings
[03:17:28.880 --> 03:17:35.600]  of people to be insured because they're going for the final move into what they
[03:17:35.600 --> 03:17:41.240]  going to do to bring down the system as Alex said a little earlier another thing
[03:17:41.240 --> 03:17:48.520]  that they're going to do here and you were talking Alex about them taking the
[03:17:48.520 --> 03:17:56.680]  funds from pensions to or are supposedly asking to buy this toxic waste
[03:17:56.680 --> 03:18:04.000]  which is these bonds which contain mortgages those that toxic waste will
[03:18:04.000 --> 03:18:10.160]  come from the FDIC and and also from the Federal Reserve which has been
[03:18:10.160 --> 03:18:16.400]  purchasing it I think they admitted they purchased about 1.2 trillion dollars of
[03:18:16.400 --> 03:18:23.800]  it from banks and brokerage houses and insurance companies and so they are
[03:18:23.800 --> 03:18:34.880]  going to go ahead and try to in some form attack your retirement and they are
[03:18:34.880 --> 03:18:40.960]  going to try to force and that won't be hard public institutions pension funds
[03:18:40.960 --> 03:18:48.320]  to purchase these things and they're also going to put as many small and
[03:18:48.320 --> 03:18:55.360]  medium-sized banks out of business as quickly as possible we could easily see
[03:18:55.360 --> 03:19:01.160]  500 banks going to this year they just they're just getting rolling and this
[03:19:01.160 --> 03:19:06.200]  there's a couple of thousand banks out there that are being overseen with
[03:19:06.200 --> 03:19:13.240]  people on the spot from the controller of the currency currency office and the
[03:19:13.240 --> 03:19:20.360]  paperwork of the plan to nationalize the banking system is already in draft form
[03:19:20.360 --> 03:19:26.680]  at the Federal Reserve and I know that for sure because my source sorry and so
[03:19:26.680 --> 03:19:31.760]  Bob stay there Bob Bob this is big news you never make stuff up you broken news
[03:19:31.760 --> 03:19:36.880]  years before it happens before this is bona fide Bob Chapman straight ahead
[03:19:36.880 --> 03:19:41.200]  inside info from inside the Federal Reserve think of it they calmly come
[03:19:41.200 --> 03:19:44.500]  out they think so little of you that they think you're so stupid and they say
[03:19:44.500 --> 03:19:47.960]  we're gonna invest your pension funds the government's gonna order your
[03:19:47.960 --> 03:20:00.200]  company to invest it in toxic assets think of the magnitude of this afraid to
[03:20:00.200 --> 03:20:05.560]  answer it afraid to answer your door did you know that debt settlement bankruptcy
[03:20:05.560 --> 03:20:09.160]  and attorneys will cost you about ten times more than you would legally be

[03:23:59.000 --> 03:24:04.800]  Cooper's producer they have a special tonight about how evil I am but they're
[03:24:04.800 --> 03:24:09.960]  gonna let me respond they're gonna interview me for 10 minutes on a
[03:24:09.960 --> 03:24:13.920]  satellite feed and they said I will then have 30 seconds they will choose the
[03:24:13.920 --> 03:24:20.960]  30 seconds in a five-minute hit piece with congressman the pieces about am I
[03:24:20.960 --> 03:24:24.720]  causing all of this it's like a London Guardian saying Alex Jones is a black
[03:24:24.720 --> 03:24:29.240]  hole causing no the banks being criminal announcing they're gonna take your
[03:24:29.240 --> 03:24:33.520]  pension funds next and taking over health care is what's causing this I need
[03:24:33.520 --> 03:24:37.200]  everybody's prayers folks I mean they are it's other property law center ADL
[03:24:37.200 --> 03:24:42.120]  CNN they're all coming after me and and they're coming after you and it's all
[03:24:42.120 --> 03:24:46.040]  about the enemy belligerence act I'm gonna cover this in the next segment I
[03:24:46.040 --> 03:24:49.160]  mean we're here telling the truth and they're hopping mad we're exposing the
[03:24:49.160 --> 03:24:53.160]  insurance companies are behind this Limbaugh won't tell you that okay he'll
[03:24:53.160 --> 03:24:56.520]  he'll tell you it's a bunch of commies doing this no it's a bunch of banks Bob
[03:24:56.520 --> 03:25:02.960]  Chapman going back to you what do you think of this CNN news it's what it's
[03:25:02.960 --> 03:25:09.960]  what you would expect it's as simple as that but I didn't know we were this
[03:25:09.960 --> 03:25:17.440]  effective Bob well you know I've been you have but I have been more unspoken
[03:25:17.440 --> 03:25:23.480]  about it we have got these people on the run the first clue was when we saw
[03:25:23.480 --> 03:25:30.480]  other radio personalities copying what you were doing and then back going to
[03:25:30.480 --> 03:25:37.080]  the limit on it and you knew that they were trying to steal your thunder
[03:25:37.080 --> 03:25:41.360]  because you were telling the truth with what they were doing as the audience
[03:25:41.360 --> 03:25:49.280]  knows 95% truth 5% misdirection and cop propaganda now they found that that was
[03:25:49.280 --> 03:25:55.560]  unaffected they're not denting the armor of Alex and in others like him so the
[03:25:55.560 --> 03:26:01.960]  next step is you're like a national disease and you're causing all this and
[03:26:01.960 --> 03:26:07.240]  you don't attack the message you get a hold of the messenger and this is what
[03:26:07.240 --> 03:26:11.920]  they're doing and I can't say no though because I said if I say no you're gonna
[03:26:11.920 --> 03:26:18.160]  say I refuse to be interviewed yes we are but then I countered but this this
[03:26:18.160 --> 03:26:21.520]  isn't even really an interview is it you're gonna show 30 seconds and they
[03:26:21.520 --> 03:26:25.240]  laughed and said that's exactly what we're gonna do they're gonna say here's
[03:26:25.240 --> 03:26:31.000]  the devil oh man I'm getting I mean I've got them saying I'm a basically a cop
[03:26:31.000 --> 03:26:34.480]  killer everywhere they're really set me up trying to think the cops are done and
[03:26:34.480 --> 03:26:38.320]  they can tell the cops that everything's my fault when I'm trying to hold people
[03:26:38.320 --> 03:26:42.960]  back from violence look I didn't mean to get distracted off into this Bob talking
[03:26:42.960 --> 03:26:49.080]  about the CNN thing in closing here you know the power of federal regulators
[03:26:49.080 --> 03:26:53.280]  they're going in it's in the articles they're ordering the pension funds to
[03:26:53.280 --> 03:26:57.960]  invest with the government and then I guess when people get mad the government's
[03:26:57.960 --> 03:27:00.920]  gonna say we're terrorists because we should be happy they're taking people's
[03:27:00.920 --> 03:27:09.800]  pension funds and that's really the bottom line they mug us they rob us and
[03:27:09.800 --> 03:27:15.880]  then if we even speak up we're bad that's right and that's what I have
[03:27:15.880 --> 03:27:22.800]  endured for almost 50 years if you if you think Anama Delos got a strong skin
[03:27:22.800 --> 03:27:27.920]  trimion I know Bob they ran you out of the USA you're not even in the US
[03:27:27.920 --> 03:27:38.880]  that's right how long's it been like I don't like getting shot at oh god I just
[03:27:38.880 --> 03:27:43.360]  and to hear these producers giggling and laughing this is all funny to them do
[03:27:43.360 --> 03:27:46.840]  they realize how real this is Bob and that their sorry but isn't worth one
[03:27:46.840 --> 03:27:51.920]  cent more than my butt to the New World Order that's right but they don't know
[03:27:51.920 --> 03:27:55.840]  that because they don't understand what you do they don't understand what the
[03:27:55.840 --> 03:28:01.760]  problem is because they're making too much money I mean you're not making 10
[03:28:01.760 --> 03:28:06.480]  or 20 million dollars a year they are so what do they care about you or me or
[03:28:06.480 --> 03:28:11.280]  anybody like but I wouldn't sell out you wouldn't sell out for a trillion yeah
[03:28:11.280 --> 03:28:16.520]  but you don't maybe the other 85% of the people in the country would and that's
[03:28:16.520 --> 03:28:19.720]  who they group that they're in
[03:28:20.400 --> 03:28:24.640]  well I've just had enough man I tell you what we got to beat these people and
[03:28:24.640 --> 03:28:28.400]  they are getting desperate do you agree with me that they're gonna stage some
[03:28:28.400 --> 03:28:32.840]  terror attacks and blaming on patriots absolutely but I don't know the timing
[03:28:32.840 --> 03:28:37.080]  but they're gonna do something the desperate people do desperate things and
[03:28:37.080 --> 03:28:43.280]  that is going to happen boy they're arrogant if they think they can steal
[03:28:43.280 --> 03:28:50.080]  people's pension funds to quote by failed banks well we've been reporting on it
[03:28:50.080 --> 03:28:54.560]  just like you have and that's what they're up to and you know the question
[03:28:54.560 --> 03:29:01.440]  is when are they gonna make the move that's visible and when they do the
[03:29:01.440 --> 03:29:06.720]  first thing I will do is get my subscribers out of those kinds of
[03:29:06.720 --> 03:29:11.880]  retirement plans that they can get out of and it's simple to do that without it
[03:29:11.880 --> 03:29:18.880]  incurring a lot of cost and sure sure you're gonna have to pay taxes but that's
[03:29:18.880 --> 03:29:23.360]  just the way it is Bob it's always informative having you on we really

[03:33:50.200 --> 03:33:54.560]  over the internet hating me within two hours of him being in custody they got
[03:33:54.560 --> 03:33:58.880]  his computer and said he did it because of Alex Jones we played a clip last week
[03:33:58.880 --> 03:34:03.840]  of the Southern Property Law Center saying Alex Jones caused it they're
[03:34:03.840 --> 03:34:09.040]  going to law enforcement and saying I am causing this when I'm here telling
[03:34:09.040 --> 03:34:13.320]  people not to be violent they are doing it because they want to demonize me and
[03:34:13.320 --> 03:34:20.160]  set me up and I'm so clean and I pay all the fraudulent IRS taxes and don't do
[03:34:20.160 --> 03:34:26.800]  anything but maybe speed in my car occasionally I do nothing I am as clean
[03:34:26.800 --> 03:34:33.600]  as a lily they don't care and you know what if they set me up it's a side of
[03:34:33.600 --> 03:34:36.920]  our success and whatever they try that's just the way it is with these
[03:34:36.920 --> 03:34:41.400]  terrorists when they are terrorists and they stage the terror attacks and they're
[03:34:41.400 --> 03:34:44.600]  doing it all they're getting ready to stage more stuff to blame it on the tea
[03:34:44.600 --> 03:34:47.680]  parties and everybody else and where those articles you gave me earlier where
[03:34:47.680 --> 03:34:51.760]  Obama people been caught attacking their own offices Denver Post they'll never
[03:34:51.760 --> 03:34:55.880]  let me show that on CNN I'm gonna go down there tonight they're interviewing me
[03:34:55.880 --> 03:35:02.280]  for 10 15 minutes or 30 seconds they'll throw some point at me probably turn the
[03:35:02.280 --> 03:35:05.920]  audio off so I don't hear it so I go excuse me to make me look I know how
[03:35:05.920 --> 03:35:10.520]  they operate and they look like I can't hear you oh we got him look here's the
[03:35:10.520 --> 03:35:16.320]  devil he can't even but I can't say no because they'll say I wouldn't show up
[03:35:16.320 --> 03:35:20.120]  for the interview and then all the sheep watching will think oh he has something
[03:35:20.120 --> 03:35:29.080]  to hide you make me sick Anderson Cooper is admitted CIA admittedly work for the
[03:35:29.080 --> 03:35:35.840]  CIA all right I want to play the 62nd radio ad for the first time for the new

[03:35:45.800 --> 03:35:50.160]  police state for also ships out in April pre-order that it exposes the whole
[03:35:50.160 --> 03:35:56.080]  system everybody's got to see these films the latest most powerful info CNN's got
[03:35:56.080 --> 03:35:59.680]  to reapply its lies millions of times all we got to do is show people the real
[03:35:59.680 --> 03:36:03.520]  paradigm once their minds are unlocked that's why we're dangerous they're
[03:36:03.520 --> 03:36:09.480]  coming after me because more than anything else the films and I want a
[03:36:09.480 --> 03:36:13.520]  commitment if they set me up plant drugs on me kill me and put me in a room with
[03:36:13.520 --> 03:36:17.720]  a dead hooker you know whatever or say I committed suicide to shoot me five times
[03:36:17.720 --> 03:36:22.840]  in the head I will never commit suicide I'm not involved in anything illegal and
[03:36:22.840 --> 03:36:27.080]  everybody who knows me knows that and they did it anything happens to me and
[03:36:27.080 --> 03:36:32.960]  if they do put me in prison or anything I want you to promise now to yourself to
[03:36:32.960 --> 03:36:44.280]  commit that you every listener will make 1000 copies of my films a year by the
[03:36:44.280 --> 03:36:49.560]  DVD copier by the blanks and make them and give them to people and take the
[03:36:49.560 --> 03:36:53.720]  audio interviews I've done the radio the TV the films and just never stop
[03:36:53.720 --> 03:36:57.880]  getting enough because that's why freedom is worth it liberty is worth it
[03:36:57.880 --> 03:37:02.720]  signing my name John Hancock up at the top is worth it because I am not going
[03:37:02.720 --> 03:37:07.240]  to be a slave these people are demonic and evil and corrupt the government's

[03:44:14.400 --> 03:44:18.640]  enemy belligerence indefinitely without trial based on their suspected activity
[03:44:18.640 --> 03:44:23.280]  the enemy belligerent interrogation detention and prosecution act of 2010
[03:44:23.280 --> 03:44:27.840]  introduced by Senators John McCain and Joseph Lieberman on Thursday with little
[03:44:27.840 --> 03:44:32.720]  fanfare sets out comprehensive policy for the detention interrogation and trial
[03:44:32.720 --> 03:44:37.040]  of suspected enemy belligerence who are believed to have engaged in hostilities
[03:44:37.040 --> 03:44:40.840]  against the United States are requiring these individuals to be held in a
[03:44:40.840 --> 03:44:45.240]  military custody as a kangaroo military trial interrogated for their
[03:44:45.240 --> 03:44:48.960]  intelligence value and not provided with a Miranda warning writes the Atlantic
[03:44:48.960 --> 03:44:57.400]  Monthly's Mark Abe abender read the bill at this PDF link the bill does not
[03:44:57.400 --> 03:45:01.520]  distinguish between US citizens and non-citizens and states that suspected
[03:45:01.520 --> 03:45:05.680]  belligerence who are considered a high-value detainee shall not be provided
[03:45:05.680 --> 03:45:09.600]  with Miranda warning a person is considered a high-value detainee they
[03:45:09.600 --> 03:45:15.040]  fulfill one of the following criteria number one now listen carefully sounds
[03:45:15.040 --> 03:45:20.280]  reasonable up front but in the presence for everyone poses a threat of an attack
[03:45:20.280 --> 03:45:23.840]  on civilians or civilian facilities within the United States or US
[03:45:23.840 --> 03:45:27.560]  facilities abroad so they say you pose a threat and remember what happened at the

[03:46:56.400 --> 03:46:59.840]  al-qaeda or terrorist group affiliated with al-qaeda or these are all different
[03:46:59.840 --> 03:47:05.080]  reasons so they mix in al-qaeda in the middle and such other matters as the
[03:47:05.080 --> 03:47:09.280]  president considers appropriate just like the cyber security bill says the

[03:47:22.000 --> 03:47:26.040]  shut limbo off we need to kick all the people out the radio and then all these
[03:47:26.040 --> 03:47:33.640]  White House officials are agreeing now your free speech is bad too this is
[03:47:33.640 --> 03:47:39.520]  treason this is treachery this is tyranny this is corruption this is on
[03:47:39.520 --> 03:47:47.440]  American this is classical corruption this is authoritarian sickness spreading
[03:47:47.440 --> 03:47:51.440]  in the nation and we're here saying stop stop don't take the pension funds
[03:47:51.440 --> 03:47:56.200]  don't rob the people don't take over health care with the IRS don't it's a
[03:47:56.200 --> 03:47:59.520]  ripoff the banks wrote at the insurance company they're like shut up terrorist
[03:47:59.520 --> 03:48:02.920]  shut up terrorist I'm talking to CNN they go the pieces about you
[03:48:02.920 --> 03:48:07.440]  we're talking to people in Washington about how dangerous you are and are you
[03:48:07.440 --> 03:48:11.040]  influencing all the stuff that's happening and and and there was a guy
[03:48:11.040 --> 03:48:16.480]  giggling in the background and I'm just like this is really America this is
[03:48:16.480 --> 03:48:22.600]  really the Orwellian state where these little yuppies and their little coddled
[03:48:22.600 --> 03:48:29.000]  cloistered positions don't even think of me as a human I'm just some nut who
[03:48:29.000 --> 03:48:32.200]  doesn't like what's happening because I've read a history book or two because I
[03:48:32.200 --> 03:48:38.080]  know what evil is and because I'm raising millions of people and I'm real
[03:48:38.080 --> 03:48:43.680]  folks I'm real the fruits of what we done of what we've done are real the
[03:48:43.680 --> 03:48:47.440]  millions we've woken up is real the fact that we're identifying the enemies of
[03:48:47.440 --> 03:48:51.880]  this republic is real and they know the system knows I'm real the system
[03:48:51.880 --> 03:48:56.820]  surveils me they know and I know why a lot of people buy into some of the
[03:48:56.820 --> 03:49:00.600]  co-commentel probe it's a minority but it's a wide group they can't believe I'm
[03:49:00.600 --> 03:49:04.160]  still alive they can't believe I've got the courage to do this they can't
[03:49:04.160 --> 03:49:08.000]  believe that I say the things I say every day they can't imagine that
[03:49:08.000 --> 03:49:12.600]  someone could be real and have courage why don't you have courage the courage
[03:49:12.600 --> 03:49:16.680]  to protect your family the courage to stand up against evil I can't even
[03:49:16.680 --> 03:49:23.320]  control myself it's not even courage I can't shut up because I know where this
[03:49:23.320 --> 03:49:27.560]  leads I know these bankers funded every mass murder in the last hundred years
[03:49:27.560 --> 03:49:35.000]  government mass murder the good news is most people that work for the system are
[03:49:35.000 --> 03:49:38.200]  not evil consciously they've been compartmentalized they've been brainwashed
[03:49:38.200 --> 03:49:41.680]  they've been dumbed down and we're deprogramming them together we're just
[03:49:41.680 --> 03:49:44.520]  showing people the bigger picture how to think for themselves how to look
[03:49:44.520 --> 03:49:50.800]  outside the box we're having an effect a real effect and we can't be bought off
[03:49:50.800 --> 03:49:55.560]  we can't be controlled we can't be manipulated we make mistakes but we
[03:49:55.560 --> 03:50:00.360]  learn we get smarter and we're teaching others how to take action and so the
[03:50:00.360 --> 03:50:08.680]  system is deathly afraid they're deathly afraid because CNN quoted some book in
[03:50:08.680 --> 03:50:12.440]  fact give me that print off Sharon and the book quote about myself and
[03:50:12.440 --> 03:50:16.280]  others is how you know how the nuts are hijacking America see that's what

[03:55:02.680 --> 03:55:06.720]  week and that was the guy kind of giggling in the background John Abelon
[03:55:06.720 --> 03:55:13.160]  and so just a completely biased piece wingnuts how the lunatic fringe is

[03:55:17.560 --> 03:55:20.320]  down anybody that disagrees with the government with the fairness doctrine
[03:55:20.320 --> 03:55:25.680]  but he can say I'm a wingnut and they're gonna try to blame me for what's
[03:55:25.680 --> 03:55:30.800]  happening when it's their bosses that are causing this truly sickening so we'll
[03:55:30.800 --> 03:55:38.480]  see what happens with that show tonight let's go to Bobby in Tennessee Bobby
[03:55:38.480 --> 03:55:44.600]  you're on the air hi I just wanted to say I'll be praying for you tonight and
[03:55:44.600 --> 03:55:47.760]  it's gonna be a lot and they're gonna it's not going on the stinking show and
[03:55:47.760 --> 03:55:52.400]  talking to some little chicken neck that's a problem it's the fact that
[03:55:52.400 --> 03:55:58.480]  they're now saying Alex Jones is the evil one well I'm just gonna say you
[03:55:58.480 --> 03:56:03.440]  know just keep plugging your your website and your shows and and everything
[03:56:03.440 --> 03:56:08.000]  I also wanted to talk to you about a way to wake up people what I've been
[03:56:08.000 --> 03:56:12.400]  doing is I got your iPhone right radio app now I don't know if anybody's brought
[03:56:12.400 --> 03:56:16.640]  this up but I turn it on when I'm going to the bank when I'm going to the grocery
[03:56:16.640 --> 03:56:21.320]  store and I just let it play and people come up and ask me you know who is this
[03:56:21.320 --> 03:56:25.800]  and you know what is he talking about so that's a good way to wake up some
[03:56:25.800 --> 03:56:29.040]  people well that's why they're scared because all our numbers are just
[03:56:29.040 --> 03:56:32.800]  exploding off the charts and they can see that we're already a threat to them
[03:56:32.800 --> 03:56:36.320]  in another six months I mean it's just it's all because of you the listeners
[03:56:36.320 --> 03:56:40.160]  spread in the word I and the great crew in there and in my dedication all of us
[03:56:40.160 --> 03:56:44.720]  together we're having a big effect and all I'm doing is reading Bloomberg where
[03:56:44.720 --> 03:56:48.400]  the government's gonna take over people's pension funds and invest it in
[03:56:48.400 --> 03:56:51.880]  failed banks that's their own words and going does that sound like a good idea
[03:56:51.880 --> 03:56:58.400]  and that that scares him he's saying it's criminal oh he's evil Bobby appreciate
[03:56:58.400 --> 03:57:01.840]  people go ahead there's a lot of people that are waking up but they're trying to
[03:57:01.840 --> 03:57:05.600]  hit this news button and if we don't do anything you know something right now
[03:57:05.600 --> 03:57:10.880]  you know I'm afraid that you know they'll keep pushing what they're
[03:57:10.880 --> 03:57:17.280]  pushing and even Glenn Beck was saying last night you know your children and
[03:57:17.280 --> 03:57:22.680]  your grandchildren be saying where were you when you know this went down so yeah
[03:57:22.680 --> 03:57:26.160]  going back it tries to get people's confidence so he can later double back
[03:57:26.160 --> 03:57:29.400]  on them but but you know I'll say this I've been watching some when he talks
[03:57:29.400 --> 03:57:33.800]  about George Washington and collectivist and I mean he's I mean they're
[03:57:33.800 --> 03:57:37.680]  letting him get on a longer and longer leash and I so is limbaugh and the fact
[03:57:37.680 --> 03:57:41.040]  that this is all being forced out in the mainstream and that is the mainstream
[03:57:41.040 --> 03:57:46.040]  Fox has more viewers than all the other cable networks combined and that's why
[03:57:46.040 --> 03:57:51.760]  CNN's a joke it's why MSNBC's a joke they're legends in their own mind God
