[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]  I've got like 10 minutes of broadcast time left, this is huge news.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]  Earlier we reported on a gentleman who's about to go public, hopefully Ground Zero EMT,
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.500]  we were told to get out of the building, the Building 7 was going to be demolished.
[00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.500]  We got that report, but a new one's going up.
[00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.500]  There's so many of these people, Luke Cacioli and the firefighters,
[00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.000]  talking about bombs going off and in molten steel like lava.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000]  This is from the program Guns and Butter, big program, nationally syndicated out of New York.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000]  And this is where they are interviewing Kevin McPatton, we'll tell you about him, emergency worker,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000]  and Indra Singh, emergency worker, where they're talking about the bombs
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000]  and being told to get back, they're going to bring Building 7 down.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000]  So here are real people on the record, more of them, and what do the feds do on their websites?
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000]  They just say none of it's real.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000]  Yeah, well it is real, I couldn't literally do my work because the firefighters
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]  slapping me on the back and saying we know they blew up 7, we were told to get back.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]  Okay, at the remembrance, at ground zero.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000]  Let's go ahead and roll this first clip from Guns and Butter,
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]  the nationally syndicated program with Indra Singh, here it is.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]  What we were expecting as an EMT or trained for live survivors,
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000]  and there were people on the pile, digging and looking for survivors,
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000]  and what would happen is they would bring someone out to the nearest TRIARS center,
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000]  we would stabilize them, put them in an ambulance and send them further uptown.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000]  So we were setting up TRIARS as close to the pile as possible, you know, as on it in many cases.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000]  So what we were doing was setting up different kinds of stations,
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000]  IV stations, cardiac stations, just wound stations, burn stations,
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000]  just trying to have an organized space.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000]  What happened with that particular TRIARS site is that pretty soon afternoon,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000]  after midday on 9-11, we had to evacuate that because they told us Building 7 was coming down.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000]  If you had been there, not being able to see very much, just flames everywhere and dark smoke,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]  it is entirely possible.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000]  I do believe that they brought Building 7 down because I heard that they were going to bring it down
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]  because it was unstable because of the collateral damage.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]  That I don't know. I can't attest to the validity of that.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000]  All I can attest to is that by noon or 1 o'clock, they told us we had to move from that TRIARS site
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.000]  up to Pace University a little further away because Building 7 was going to come down or being brought down.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000]  Did they actually use the word brought down? And who was it that was telling you this?
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]  The fire department. The fire department.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]  And they did use the word, we're going to have to bring it down.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:55.000]  For us there, observing the nature of the devastation, it made total sense to us that this was indeed a possibility.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000]  Given the subsequent controversy over it, I don't know.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000]  I'm not an engineer. All I know is that was my experience.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000]  We backed off a little bit to Pace University.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000]  There was another panic around 4 o'clock because they were bringing the building down.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.000]  People seemed to know this ahead of time, so people were panicking again and running.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:28.000]  I went back to One Liberty, which was further south of where I was before.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]  There were TRIARS sites set up in there.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.000]  We were treating basically people who were on the pile digging for survivors, if there were any.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]  It was basically chaos.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000]  I asked who was in charge, for instance, because I'm supposed to check in with whoever's in charge and no one seemed to know.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000]  It was complete and utter chaos there, if there was someone in charge.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.000]  The normal response units around for a multi-casualty incident, they didn't know.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000]  One of the big problems is that so many people in the fire department and the police department at high level...
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]  We're going to go through all this and play more of it tomorrow.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000]  We're going to get the host and these individuals on very soon.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]  That's the main priority, Kevin. Get on it.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]  I know you're already on it.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]  Let's be clear.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.000]  Now when they fall back and say, okay, maybe we did blow it up, then there's no discussion of how it takes weeks to set a building to be imploded.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000]  I remember ABC News when I was in the car that afternoon when it fell.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]  Then I got home and saw the replays.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000]  They were announcing Building 7 was on fire.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]  It could fall and damage other buildings.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]  They want to bring it down.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000]  They may bring it down to save other buildings.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]  Everybody heard it. The firemen all heard it.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.000]  It's hidden in plain view and it's still denied.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]  People still try to deny it.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]  I've talked to countless firefighters and there have been firefighters in newspapers and magazines that have said it.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]  Bombs going off.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000]  They were told to get back.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]  It was going to be brought down.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]  No modern steel building had ever fallen from fire.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]  Three of them did that day.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]  Building 7 not hit by a plane.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]  Play one more time.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000]  The firefighter is talking about the molten steel running down the channel rails like a foundry in Tower 1 and 2.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000]  You got that?
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]  Because this is so important.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000]  Here it is.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:33.000]  You get down below and you see molten steel running down the channel rails like you're in a foundry.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:44.000]  Now that's Tower 1 and 2 brought down by unconventional demolitions, cutter charges and blast charges.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]  But then you have Building 7.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:54.000]  And when we get back, Kevin McFadden, emergency worker, and what he saw and what he witnessed.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000]  So you want names, there are names right there.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]  And the names go on and on and on.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.000]  Do you have the clip where they're talking about it looked like it was a controlled demolition as if they had detonators, boom, boom, boom?
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]  Yeah, we'll get that clip, too.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000]  We'll play that coming out.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]  Then we'll play the new clip for you.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000]  How's that sound?
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000]  A fire department situation room filled with firefighters talking about it.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000]  Okay?
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000]  We got two in the computer.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000]  Make sure it's the one that's got the cussing cut out, please.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000]  Sometimes we have the raw clip in there, too.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000]  John working like an octopus with 18 arms.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:43.000]  Final segment in the Infowar Zone, engaging the enemy at point blank range and winning every time.
