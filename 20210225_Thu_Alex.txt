[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[00:10.000 --> 00:25.000]  Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist who was a parent.
[00:25.000 --> 00:29.000]  Alex Jones.
[00:29.000 --> 00:35.000]  Stop! Russian, stop!
[00:35.000 --> 00:40.000]  The war has come to mind.
[00:40.000 --> 00:51.000]  Reputation is amazing. I will not let you down. You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:51.000 --> 00:56.000]  The Alex Jones show. There is a war on for your mind.
[00:56.000 --> 01:00.000]  I mean, I'm not even worthy to be bringing you information that's powerful.
[01:00.000 --> 01:05.000]  And I hope that you pay attention to what we cover here, minute by minute.
[01:05.000 --> 01:09.000]  Because I've had chills since last night.
[01:09.000 --> 01:14.000]  This just confirms everything else we've already researched.
[01:14.000 --> 01:19.000]  A Rockefeller study envisions future dictatorship controlled by elite,
[01:19.000 --> 01:24.000]  millions being killed, mandatory quarantines, checkpoints, the end of the family,
[01:24.000 --> 01:28.000]  and the other documents, but this dovetails with all the other Rockefeller Foundation documents
[01:28.000 --> 01:33.000]  about the GMO food to sterilize you and force vaccines, and the hell we're already living in.
[01:33.000 --> 01:38.000]  This is going to continue to intensify until we take our governments back from these eugenics madmen.
[01:38.000 --> 01:41.000]  But that story is up on prisonplanet.com.
[01:41.000 --> 01:44.000]  The question is, will you have the courage to really do the research yourself?
[01:44.000 --> 01:48.000]  Because I don't want you to just sit here and hear me make these claims.
[01:48.000 --> 01:51.000]  These people are so arrogant that they write policy papers.
[01:51.000 --> 01:56.000]  So many of them that they're producing these policy papers and reports and white papers
[01:56.000 --> 01:59.000]  so fast that you could never read them all.
[01:59.000 --> 02:03.000]  It is an open conspiracy against you and your family.
[02:03.000 --> 02:08.000]  I pray to God, I pray to my heavenly Father Jesus Christ every night to give me the strength
[02:08.000 --> 02:12.000]  and the will to be able to face this fire and to give me the strength to carry on.
[02:12.000 --> 02:16.000]  Because I know why a lot of you don't want to look at this information
[02:16.000 --> 02:21.000]  and just want to comment on the YouTube videos or on message boards that I'm a liar.
[02:21.000 --> 02:28.000]  I know why, because it's scary.
[02:28.000 --> 02:32.000]  You're not going to be able to go to the ball games anymore.
[02:32.000 --> 02:35.000]  You're not going to be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends.
[02:35.000 --> 02:40.000]  You're not going to be able to just go out and enjoy yourself all the time.
[02:40.000 --> 02:45.000]  The only chance we've got of beating this scientific dictatorship,
[02:45.000 --> 02:51.000]  this creeping death that takes its time to incrementally enslave you.
[02:51.000 --> 02:54.000]  Mentally, psychologically, physically, spiritually.
[02:54.000 --> 02:59.000]  The only way to defeat it is for the rank and file of this planet
[02:59.000 --> 03:05.000]  to realize that you have a choice to make on what your destiny is going to be.
[03:05.000 --> 03:09.000]  Once you face this information, once you've consciously admitted it to yourself,
[03:09.000 --> 03:13.000]  it will take over your life. It should take over your life.
[03:13.000 --> 03:18.000]  I mean, what else? What else could it do?
[03:18.000 --> 03:22.000]  We've got to get past the artificial stigma that the controlled corporate media
[03:22.000 --> 03:30.000]  has been putting out for decades ahead of their opening of unveiling of planetary dictatorship.
[03:30.000 --> 03:33.000]  They all talk about how we need a police state to carry this out.
[03:33.000 --> 03:37.000]  Canada and the United States are going to work in lockstep,
[03:37.000 --> 03:41.000]  display the seriousness of our commitment at both home and abroad.
[03:41.000 --> 03:46.000]  When lose or draw, you need to choose a side.
[03:46.000 --> 03:51.000]  Info wars, tomorrow's news today.
[03:51.000 --> 03:56.000]  And ladies and gentlemen, that is from more than 10 years ago,
[03:56.000 --> 04:00.000]  and I've said we have to lay the groundwork so enough people are aware of this
[04:00.000 --> 04:04.000]  before they launch their final takeover plan.
[04:04.000 --> 04:08.000]  Well, now they've triggered the final takeover plan.
[04:08.000 --> 04:11.000]  And it's going to be incremental, but it's still going to accelerate from here on out,
[04:11.000 --> 04:18.000]  and it will result in first you eating synthetic meat made out of cockroach guts,
[04:18.000 --> 04:22.000]  drinking sewage, eating weeds. You'll not be allowed to have any other food.
[04:22.000 --> 04:25.000]  That's what announced by Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab. They will enforce it.
[04:25.000 --> 04:30.000]  Not being able to leave your house unless your digital iPhone or droid says you're authorized to,
[04:30.000 --> 04:35.000]  inoculations every month of whatever new DNA splicing system they want.
[04:35.000 --> 04:40.000]  And anyone complaining about half your neighbor's dying will be arrested.
[04:40.000 --> 04:44.000]  And so it's all being set up. The planetary depopulation is here.
[04:44.000 --> 04:47.000]  The globalists are coming to murder you and your family right now.
[04:47.000 --> 04:50.000]  It's all incremental. You can decide to face it and say no to it,
[04:50.000 --> 04:53.000]  or you can keep submitting and have the news call you a hero
[04:53.000 --> 04:57.000]  and slit your throat metaphorically.
[05:00.000 --> 05:04.000]  Finally, vitamin D3 and vitamin K that are both essential are getting the respect
[05:04.000 --> 05:07.000]  and the attention they deserve. We've got a great product.
[05:07.000 --> 05:11.000]  It's been out for six years, winter sun. Long before the big crisis came along,
[05:11.000 --> 05:14.000]  we were there saying this is high quality, this will make you healthy,
[05:14.000 --> 05:16.000]  this will be better for you and your family.
[05:16.000 --> 05:21.000]  But what else doesn't get attention, and needs to be looked at, is vitamin B12.
[05:21.000 --> 05:25.000]  It is just as essential. It is just as important, and it is amazing.
[05:25.000 --> 05:29.000]  And it's not just about your immune system. It's about every part of your body.
[05:29.000 --> 05:34.000]  It's really a hormone and it's what your building blocks of your entire body
[05:34.000 --> 05:37.000]  operate off of. So these vitamins are essential.
[05:37.000 --> 05:42.000]  Vitamin D3 and of course vitamin B12 go together like a horse and carriage,
[05:42.000 --> 05:46.000]  do your own research. We've got the highest grades you're going to find out there
[05:46.000 --> 05:49.000]  and they're taken out of the tongue. It's key to put it under the tongue
[05:49.000 --> 05:52.000]  for about a minute and let it sit so your blood vessels absorb it.
[05:52.000 --> 05:57.000]  They're both available 50% off at infowarstore.com together or by themselves
[05:57.000 --> 06:00.000]  at 50% off and 25% off.
[06:17.000 --> 06:20.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Thursday.
[06:20.000 --> 06:24.000]  February 25th of the year is 2021.
[06:24.000 --> 06:28.000]  I'm Alex Jones, coming to you from the embattled info wars headquarters
[06:28.000 --> 06:30.000]  in Central Texas.
[06:33.000 --> 06:36.000]  Well, we knew it was coming. They were putting in a
[06:36.000 --> 06:41.000]  Skeletor type reanimated cryptkeeper who can hardly talk.
[06:41.000 --> 06:44.000]  It has clear deep dementia.
[06:44.000 --> 06:49.000]  So the bureaucracy could permanently dismantle another sector of
[06:49.000 --> 06:52.000]  the government and get further control.
[06:52.000 --> 06:57.000]  And of course, I'm talking about the presidency and the executive branch.
[06:57.000 --> 07:02.000]  And so Nancy Pelosi, who already asked for the nuclear codes to be taken away
[07:02.000 --> 07:08.000]  from Trump just last month on January 8th, is now asking the codes be taken
[07:08.000 --> 07:11.000]  away from Joe Biden.
[07:11.000 --> 07:16.000]  As Trump said right before he left office via fraud,
[07:16.000 --> 07:21.000]  when he addressed the border patrol down in South Texas in McAllen,
[07:21.000 --> 07:27.000]  in the slow burb of Alamo, he said it will be the 25th amendment
[07:27.000 --> 07:32.000]  that comes back to haunt Joe Biden, not Donald John Trump.
[07:32.000 --> 07:37.000]  But this was done by design so that you could have an executive branch
[07:37.000 --> 07:42.000]  that's basically taken over, dissolved into the permanent bureaucracy.
[07:42.000 --> 07:44.000]  They've already got most of the Congress.
[07:44.000 --> 07:47.000]  They've already got the Supreme Court to a great extent.
[07:47.000 --> 07:50.000]  They've already got a lot of the governorships in most of the cities
[07:50.000 --> 07:52.000]  under globalist control.
[07:52.000 --> 07:58.000]  So now even powerful alpha male type presidents who are globalists
[07:58.000 --> 08:02.000]  still want to throw their weight around and still want to be in charge.
[08:02.000 --> 08:03.000]  But they don't want that.
[08:03.000 --> 08:08.000]  That's why ten years ago, five years before it happened,
[08:08.000 --> 08:13.000]  Leo Zagami, an amazing reporter on the Vatican, big insider,
[08:13.000 --> 08:17.000]  he's on the inside of it, the P2 Lodge, said they're going to have
[08:17.000 --> 08:20.000]  this Jesuit guy who's now the pope, the pope,
[08:20.000 --> 08:22.000]  and the other pope won't die.
[08:22.000 --> 08:24.000]  He'll just step down.
[08:24.000 --> 08:28.000]  And because they want to get it, the public used to have like five or six popes.
[08:28.000 --> 08:29.000]  They don't want a president.
[08:29.000 --> 08:30.000]  They don't want a pope.
[08:30.000 --> 08:33.000]  They don't want to, because people tend to be when they're the head guy,
[08:33.000 --> 08:34.000]  to be the head guy.
[08:34.000 --> 08:38.000]  They want the bureaucracy behind the scenes to be in total control.
[08:38.000 --> 08:44.000]  And so just on the face of it, obviously if you go to a committee of Democrats,
[08:44.000 --> 08:47.000]  that's who it is, and the attorney general and lawyers,
[08:47.000 --> 08:54.000]  if the Russians and the Chinese launch a nuclear weapon,
[08:54.000 --> 08:56.000]  then you're going to absorb that first strike.
[08:56.000 --> 09:01.000]  And so the mutually assured destruction doctrine has kept this nuclear war free
[09:01.000 --> 09:04.000]  since the 1950s will be null and void.
[09:04.000 --> 09:08.000]  This is Nancy Pelosi out there reviewing the troops,
[09:08.000 --> 09:13.000]  like she's a communist commissar from Red Dawn strutting up and down.
[09:13.000 --> 09:17.000]  She loves guns and tanks and armored vehicles when they're for her power over you,
[09:17.000 --> 09:20.000]  but she doesn't want you to have a semi-automatic shotgun,
[09:20.000 --> 09:23.000]  handgun or rifle and has legislation introduced or just that.
[09:23.000 --> 09:31.000]  So an incredible letter, and I put a whole report up on this at infowars.com.
[09:31.000 --> 09:38.000]  That's also posted at band.video with the headline Democrats attempt to take control
[09:38.000 --> 09:39.000]  of the nuclear codes.
[09:39.000 --> 09:43.000]  Democrats want control of the nuclear codes.
[09:43.000 --> 09:56.000]  And that just shows you the power frenzy that is taking place inside of our collapsing banana republic.
[09:56.000 --> 10:01.000]  Pelosi demands Biden transfer nuclear codes to Democrats is the actual headline.
[10:01.000 --> 10:03.000]  And I shot that last night and put it out.
[10:03.000 --> 10:11.000]  This has been just normalized for the public and is beyond dangerous.
[10:11.000 --> 10:14.000]  And there's a lot of facets to that that I break down in the video,
[10:14.000 --> 10:16.000]  and I'll be breaking it down more today.
[10:16.000 --> 10:22.000]  But on the surface, it's like, oh, we don't want you to have first strike capability.
[10:22.000 --> 10:24.000]  That deals with presidential decision directives.
[10:24.000 --> 10:28.000]  But then they actually say, well, just before any weapons are used,
[10:28.000 --> 10:30.000]  you have to go to this consortium.
[10:30.000 --> 10:33.000]  Well, that mixes the different branches of government.
[10:33.000 --> 10:36.000]  And as much as I don't like Joe Biden having the nuclear weapons,
[10:36.000 --> 10:41.000]  the military is really in control of those and has a history of knowing how to control them and not using them.
[10:41.000 --> 10:45.000]  Do you want to give Nancy Pelosi and the folks that have managed the blue cities and the ground,
[10:45.000 --> 10:48.000]  the people that are infiltrated by so many communist Chinese agents,
[10:48.000 --> 10:49.000]  it will make your head spin.
[10:49.000 --> 10:53.000]  Do you want them in charge of the nuclear weapons?
[10:53.000 --> 10:55.000]  Is that what you want?
[10:55.000 --> 10:58.000]  Because that is indeed where they're going.
[10:58.000 --> 11:01.000]  And I said this over and over again.
[11:01.000 --> 11:05.000]  If they have a weak Biden, who'll just sign whatever they put in front of him,
[11:05.000 --> 11:10.000]  he can sign away the checks and balances on the border, on the military, on national security.
[11:10.000 --> 11:11.000]  He's already done it.
[11:11.000 --> 11:13.000]  Oh, China can be involved in our power grid.
[11:13.000 --> 11:15.000]  Oh, China can be involved in our colleges again.
[11:15.000 --> 11:17.000]  The Chinese government that says we shouldn't exist.
[11:17.000 --> 11:19.000]  Oh, China can have death camps.
[11:19.000 --> 11:21.000]  China can invade Hong Kong.
[11:21.000 --> 11:26.000]  This is not a slippery slope to tyranny and capitulation to China.
[11:26.000 --> 11:28.000]  We've gone over the edge.
[11:28.000 --> 11:31.000]  I mean, you have Hunter Biden's laptop.
[11:31.000 --> 11:34.000]  The head of Chinese intelligence tells you what to do.
[11:34.000 --> 11:36.000]  I met with him and the other guy disappeared.
[11:36.000 --> 11:39.000]  Oh, the alibaba had alibaba had.
[11:39.000 --> 11:42.000]  And we just don't know what to do.
[11:42.000 --> 11:46.000]  This is also incredibly frightening.
[11:46.000 --> 11:53.000]  This is all, you know, I'm under investigation by the southern district of New York.
[11:53.000 --> 11:55.000]  What am I going to do?
[11:55.000 --> 12:01.000]  And now none of that matters because China can use all that dirt on Biden.
[12:01.000 --> 12:03.000]  See, the left's like, oh, well, he's our guy.
[12:03.000 --> 12:05.000]  Let him be a Chinese agent.
[12:05.000 --> 12:07.000]  Let Feinstein be a Chinese agent.
[12:07.000 --> 12:10.000]  Let Eric Swal as well be a Chinese agent.
[12:10.000 --> 12:13.000]  All of that is okay because he's our agent.
[12:13.000 --> 12:22.000]  No, you are a leftist that lives in a coffin apartment and drives a solar powered car that doesn't work if you have one.
[12:22.000 --> 12:28.000]  You don't know anything, you don't run anything, you're pretending in your Twitter echo chamber that you're part of the power structure.
[12:28.000 --> 12:35.000]  You're part of nothing but being a useful idiot as V.I. Lennon would call you.
[12:35.000 --> 12:45.000]  The Communist Chinese are incredibly authoritarian, set up as an authoritarian command base by the globalist in the 70s, 80s and 90s to take the world over.
[12:45.000 --> 12:47.000]  And that's what's happening.
[12:47.000 --> 12:54.000]  But the left fetishizes everywhere, it's spray put on the walls in Austin and in Minnesota and New York, I've seen it in my own eyes.
[12:54.000 --> 13:05.000]  And all over the news that G.G. Ping's badass and he's going to crush us and he'll teach the conservatives how to operate and, man, we've got G.G. Ping, he'll defeat America.
[13:05.000 --> 13:15.000]  And here are these fools watching all of our rights and freedoms and our dollar and our military swept away and now the nuclear weapons in the control
[13:15.000 --> 13:19.000]  center, they get their way of the completely compromised Democrat Congress.
[13:19.000 --> 13:28.000]  But don't forget Mitch McConnell's wife on the Chinese government payroll and Mitch McConnell has come out and said he will approve Merrick Garland,
[13:28.000 --> 13:34.000]  one of the votes they need in the Senate, who says he wants to confiscate guns and says Antifa is not bad.
[13:34.000 --> 13:40.000]  So the bottom is dropping out, ladies and gentlemen, and it's only going to get more insane from here.
[13:40.000 --> 13:48.000]  We have a nation of appeasers and rule followers and order takers who think submitting to all this tyranny will get them ahead.
[13:48.000 --> 13:51.000]  And it may have gotten you ahead for 50 years selling the country out.
[13:51.000 --> 13:56.000]  But now that instinct to stand up for nothing is going to destroy us.
[13:56.000 --> 13:59.000]  And that's about as simple as I could put it.
[13:59.000 --> 14:04.000]  We're going to go over the nuclear codes and why it's so intense and why it's so huge and what it illustrates.
[14:04.000 --> 14:12.000]  Then we're going to hit the massive next level of censorship and clamp down and control and deplatforming and debanking and
[14:12.000 --> 14:18.000]  depersoning that's coming up and what Glenn Greenwald's been breaking down.
[14:18.000 --> 14:24.000]  And we're also going to look at the war on women with the whole transgender movement and the major developments on that front,
[14:24.000 --> 14:29.000]  the economy and several guests as well today.
[14:29.000 --> 14:34.000]  Absolutely. We are selling out of these in the next four to five days.
[14:34.000 --> 14:38.000]  But despite that, I'm still keeping them discounted massively.
[14:38.000 --> 14:45.000]  And that is the privacy pockets little Faraday cages at infowarstore.com for your cell phone tracking system so that you can get in the habit of
[14:45.000 --> 14:48.000]  locking it up and using the phone when you want to.
[14:48.000 --> 14:53.000]  So it doesn't track your location and constantly transmit all your data back to Big Brother.
[14:53.000 --> 14:56.000]  It's just the first step becoming aware of what's happening and taking control of your life.
[14:56.000 --> 14:59.000]  Those are available at infowarstore.com for $19.95.

[15:30.000 --> 15:32.000]  These are 2000 calorie meals.
[15:32.000 --> 15:33.000]  It just blows everything away.
[15:33.000 --> 15:37.000]  We're so blessed to have the best sponsor out there infowarstore.com.
[15:37.000 --> 15:39.000]  I would get insurance you can eat.
[15:39.000 --> 15:45.000]  The whole globalist plan is about making you under their control, making you dependent, making you absolutely on your knees.
[15:45.000 --> 15:55.000]  And wonderful places where it all starts is a big discount for pair with Alex.com as well.
[15:55.000 --> 16:01.000]  The people are awakening.
[16:01.000 --> 16:04.000]  They're taking control of their own environments.
[16:04.000 --> 16:06.000]  Cell phones are an amazing tool.
[16:06.000 --> 16:13.000]  Really, they're a supercomputer that's handheld, but big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments,
[16:13.000 --> 16:21.000]  ChiComs especially are using this to steal your data, to share your data, to be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop up
[16:21.000 --> 16:27.000]  billions of people's data that can actually predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[16:27.000 --> 16:33.000]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[16:33.000 --> 16:35.000]  In their own words, they admit it.
[16:35.000 --> 16:40.000]  So I've been selling privacy pouches and pocket pockets and things like that for more than a decade.
[16:40.000 --> 16:43.000]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight. They're faraday cages.
[16:43.000 --> 16:46.000]  They just look like a cloth on the lobe. They work absolutely great.
[16:46.000 --> 16:53.000]  And it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over your identity when you are traveling
[16:53.000 --> 16:56.000]  and don't want big brother to know what you're up to because it's not their business.

[18:24.000 --> 18:30.000]  It's the 24th of February, 2021 on this Wednesday evening.
[18:30.000 --> 18:34.000]  I was about to pack up and go home to see my wife and family.
[18:34.000 --> 18:38.000]  And I saw the news story and couldn't believe it.
[18:38.000 --> 18:41.000]  So I went to the Congressional website. I checked the signatures.
[18:41.000 --> 18:43.000]  I checked the Twitter accounts and it's true.
[18:43.000 --> 19:01.000]  Nancy Pelosi, through her surrogates and a long list of members of Congress, has sent a letter to Joe Biden, who will sign anything she puts in front of him, to transfer the nuclear codes to her and a group of congressmen and women, as well as the attorney general.
[19:01.000 --> 19:16.000]  Now, obviously, if Russia or China launched a nuclear attack, it's the president, the executive branch, the constitution that has the power and the responsibility to defend against that.
[19:16.000 --> 19:26.000]  And you can't have a long, deliberate process of going to Congress and going to the attorney general and getting this whole laundromat.
[19:26.000 --> 19:33.000]  We don't elect the attorney general of the United States to say of launching a nuclear attack is legal.
[19:33.000 --> 19:36.000]  We elect a commander in chief to be over the military.
[19:36.000 --> 19:37.000]  And that's who decides that.
[19:37.000 --> 19:40.000]  If we have declaration of war and go to war with the country, that's Congress.
[19:40.000 --> 19:51.000]  But in an emergency capacity, if America has been attacked, that's the modern world, it is the policy of this country and other countries that the chief executive of the armed forces in the U.S.
[19:51.000 --> 19:56.000]  deal with that threat.
[19:56.000 --> 20:00.000]  To follow this would be to invite a first strike by Russia or China.
[20:00.000 --> 20:08.000]  So to have Pelosi doing this after five, six years before Trump even got elected, of saying he is a Russian agent for five years at least.
[20:08.000 --> 20:09.000]  We've been hearing this.
[20:09.000 --> 20:13.000]  And then to see them do something like this is just incredibly dangerous.
[20:13.000 --> 20:21.000]  You've got to read the letter that a whole list of members of Congress signed on to.
[20:21.000 --> 20:28.000]  The Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi and the leader of the Senate, Chuck E. Schumer, have not hidden the fact that they are the ones behind this.
[20:28.000 --> 20:41.000]  In fact, back on January 8th, last month, before Trump was already gone from office via their election fraud, they went to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had a conversation about taking the nuclear codes away from the president.
[20:41.000 --> 20:43.000]  So you call Trump a dictator all day.
[20:43.000 --> 20:45.000]  You can call Biden a dictator all day.
[20:45.000 --> 20:50.000]  But if you transfer military operations to Congress, it's unconstitutional.
[20:50.000 --> 20:55.000]  It's insanely dangerous because then you can't respond to an outside foreign threat.
[20:55.000 --> 20:57.000]  This is simply amazing.
[20:57.000 --> 20:58.000]  Go rid of yourself.
[20:58.000 --> 21:10.000]  It says right here on the second page that a consortium of bureaucrats and lawyers will be in control and that the attorney general will confirm whether it's legal or not.
[21:10.000 --> 21:16.000]  How's the attorney general, no international law or the rules of war or U.S. nuclear engagement policy?
[21:16.000 --> 21:25.000]  This is a true coup over the executive branch, over our military, and over 250-plus years of this nation's existence.
[21:25.000 --> 21:41.000]  No one on the planet, from France to the U.K. to Russia to China to Israel, has their Congress or their connection or their parliament in control of the deployment of nuclear weapons or any other weapons.
[21:41.000 --> 21:45.000]  But this is the bureaucratic lawyer desire for power.
[21:45.000 --> 22:00.000]  We know that communist China, working through their agents like Eric Swallowswell, who's been penetrated by literal sex operatives, are the ones that ran the second impeachment and are the ones that have been threatening to use nuclear weapons on American gun owners that we don't submit to them.
[22:00.000 --> 22:10.000]  So this is clearly China trying to use their operatives like Joe Biden, who has said, hey, I am more than happy to let China invade Hong Kong.
[22:10.000 --> 22:21.000]  I'm more than happy to have China have death camps, and so they know that he and his son are totally compromised, and now they're going to use congressional pressure to have them come to Biden and start transferring the power illegally to them.
[22:21.000 --> 22:25.000]  So Biden must be removed, Pelosi must be removed.
[22:25.000 --> 22:30.000]  This just shows what allowing this bureaucratic coup has done, what the election fraud has allowed.
[22:30.000 --> 22:33.000]  Now they say their main mission is war with American gun owners.
[22:33.000 --> 22:38.000]  Now they say they want a civil war to reeducate us, and they're literally on the tit of the communist Chinese.
[22:38.000 --> 22:47.000]  Hollywood's literally owned by the communist Chinese, and so many members of Congress from Dian Feinstein to Swallowswell are on their payroll.
[22:47.000 --> 23:02.000]  And this is now the point we've gotten to where the Attorney General and the Secretary of State and the Vice President and the Speaker of the House and a panel of members of the House and Senate will decide when we use nuclear weapons.
[23:02.000 --> 23:04.000]  It's just incredible.
[23:04.000 --> 23:10.000]  It's so mind blowing, but again, the globalists don't like us having a country.
[23:10.000 --> 23:16.000]  They don't like having a house, a Senate, which is a legislative branch, the judicial, the courts, or the executive.
[23:16.000 --> 23:28.000]  They want control of it all through these bureaucracies, through things like Enron, these corporate management boards that actually make the decisions, and then legislative bodies become vestigial.
[23:28.000 --> 23:34.000]  We already let Congress inside or trade outside the law. We already let them surveil us outside the law.
[23:34.000 --> 23:37.000]  We already let them engage in so many crimes that's mind boggling.
[23:37.000 --> 23:46.000]  It's not enough now to ship our jobs to Communist China and to have the Clintons give them our missile secrets and ICBM secrets and nuclear weapons secrets under the Clintons.
[23:46.000 --> 23:55.000]  Now they're trying to hobble us further where the executive branch doesn't even have control of the nuclear weapons, but that makes sense because Biden is a hand puppet.
[23:55.000 --> 24:00.000]  He is a puppet of the Communist Chinese, so this is the logical extension.
[24:00.000 --> 24:09.000]  He's only been in office a month and a few days, and already they're trying to transfer the nuclear weapons over to a group of Democrat Party bureaucrats.
[24:09.000 --> 24:20.000]  I mean, really, the headline here is Nancy Pelosi asked Biden to put nuclear weapons under control of the Democratic Party, because that's what this is.
[24:20.000 --> 24:27.000]  Merrick Garland and Nancy Pelosi and all the rest of them. So if America puts up with this, we deserve what we get.
[24:27.000 --> 24:42.000]  There's this belief that, oh, America's invincible and America's too big to fail, but the very people running America are running into the ground and don't want it to exist and have been groomed for decades to serve foreign powers and foreign banks and foreign corporations.
[24:42.000 --> 24:50.000]  So I'm just going to ask the left. You really want the nuclear weapons in control of the corrupt attorney general, the new attorney general.
[24:50.000 --> 24:59.000]  And the answer is, of course you do. You have a sycophantic love affair with tyranny. You have a sycophantic love affair with corruption, and lawyers run this country.
[24:59.000 --> 25:04.000]  They've run it in the ground, and so now they're going to play general and be in control of the nuclear weapons.
[25:04.000 --> 25:15.000]  I'll be covering this all tomorrow on my weekday show, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. There's also Washington Journal, weekday mornings with Tom Papert and Harrison Smith, and of course I'll destroy her with the war room, 3 to 6 p.m.
[25:15.000 --> 25:29.000]  I don't know how long we're going to be on here. And that is a report. Again, I filed last night. I would like to now give the number out and take your calls for the next hour, the next half hour, the first half hour, the next hour, then Tom Papert's got big breaking news.
[25:29.000 --> 25:38.000]  The National File helped expose whistleblowers, AT&T working with Huawei and the Communist Chinese to basically take over the U.S.
[25:38.000 --> 25:48.000]  We broke that with Papert two days ago when he hosted the morning show, National File, and that was covered by Tucker Carlson last night.
[25:48.000 --> 25:55.000]  We're really proud of the great work that the folks at the National File do. They're just amazing people, and we're glad to work with them.
[25:55.000 --> 26:00.000]  AT&T doubles down on working with CCP, confirms everything, Tucker Carlson, National File reported.
[26:00.000 --> 26:11.000]  This is the sellout of the country to authoritarianism, and they can use executive power to commit massive crimes, claiming that the executive has that power to do that unless they're impeached.
[26:11.000 --> 26:16.000]  And then all these people that commit these crimes believe they will not go to prison, no matter what happens in the future.
[26:16.000 --> 26:29.000]  So Trump was four years of holding him off partially. Now we have gone off of the deep end. Toll-free number to join us on air today is 877-789-2539-8777.
[26:29.000 --> 26:43.000]  789-Alex, 877-789-2539. Let's do first-time callers in the first round, and it's specifically on the Democrats wanting the nuclear launch codes and moving towards 25th Amendment with Biden.
[26:43.000 --> 26:52.000]  So that shows they put him in there as a placeholder the whole time, so they can blame him for a bunch of crimes they commit and put a new puppet in, and then continue following through on that policy.
[26:52.000 --> 26:59.000]  877-789-2539. I'm Alex Jones, infoawards.com.
[26:59.000 --> 27:08.000]  In the early 1990s, there was a really funny movie that came out called Wayne's World.
[27:08.000 --> 27:14.000]  Before I had an access to this show in the mid-1990s, I went and saw that movie and thought, man, that looks fun.
[27:14.000 --> 27:19.000]  In fact, you speak out and have your own ideas, and even if you're a nerd, you're still entertaining because you're real.
[27:19.000 --> 27:21.000]  Well, what do they say in Wayne's World?
[27:21.000 --> 27:25.000]  We're not worthy! We're not worthy!
[27:25.000 --> 27:31.000]  Every day when I cover these huge topics, I don't feel worthy to talk to you, because these topics are so huge, they're so real.
[27:31.000 --> 27:34.000]  But I'm trying to tell you the truth. I'm trying to get it right, and most of the time we do.
[27:34.000 --> 27:40.000]  The globalists love lying to you. They love manipulating you. They enjoy destroying humanity.
[27:40.000 --> 27:44.000]  They enjoy manipulating ideas and using people's ignorance against them.
[27:44.000 --> 27:48.000]  That, for me, is really a success and disgusting.
[27:48.000 --> 27:54.000]  So you've got to pledge for myself and the whole infoawards crew that we will never join the globalists.
[27:54.000 --> 27:58.000]  We will never knowingly manipulate you, because we know we're all in this together.
[27:58.000 --> 28:09.000]  We've just launched the biggest sale of 2021. Store-wide free shipping and up to 50% off our best-selling items and free shipping on storeable food.
[28:09.000 --> 28:18.000]  That's a huge part of the cost. We rarely do this. That is a gigantic sale, and an additional 10% off as well, because of the crisis and the emergency.
[28:18.000 --> 28:23.000]  Our supplier has decided to let us do this. You will not find quality food anywhere near this price anywhere.

[29:14.000 --> 29:27.000]  The virus has been banned. Arrested. Attacked and threatened. Because we are effective.
[29:27.000 --> 29:36.000]  The great awakening is here. Go to banned.video. Download the videos and share.
[29:36.000 --> 29:46.000]  Support the information war at infowarstore.com. And never give up the fight.
[29:46.000 --> 30:10.000]  InfoWars.com.
[30:16.000 --> 30:28.000]  The most forbidden, verbote attack censored, lied about broadcast in the world is.
[30:28.000 --> 30:34.000]  The Alicantia and InfoWars. And for a good reason.
[30:34.000 --> 30:42.000]  They study the globalist and actual plans. We know how to stop them and that scares the living daylights out of them.
[30:42.000 --> 30:48.000]  And there's a term they have for literature and movies that get better with time or are timeless.
[30:48.000 --> 30:56.000]  They're called Evergreen. And when they took down our five big YouTube channels with over five billion views total,
[30:56.000 --> 31:06.000]  they destroyed over 60,000 videos that we had posted in the 12 or 13 years that YouTube had existed when that happened three years ago.
[31:06.000 --> 31:14.000]  But somehow listeners have gone to their old computers or into their VHS tapes or DVDs where they burned these shows,
[31:14.000 --> 31:22.000]  where they saved them, burned them on the disk, not burned them like book burning like Amazon is now doing.
[31:22.000 --> 31:26.000]  And people are going and watching it and they're really getting freaked out.
[31:26.000 --> 31:32.000]  Because it's one thing for me to make claims 10 years ago, 15 years ago, 20 years ago.
[31:32.000 --> 31:40.000]  It's another thing to see it happen because this stuff was fantastical sounding back then, but very entertaining.
[31:40.000 --> 31:45.000]  Like Harry Shearer said, Alex Jones is an amazing science fiction writer.
[31:45.000 --> 31:51.000]  No, Harry. I was reading the Rockefeller documents of the UN documents.
[31:51.000 --> 31:57.000]  How they would end the biological sexes by 20, 20, 30.
[31:57.000 --> 32:02.000]  With chemicals in the water. And now you see the numbers coming out. I'm going to cover it here in a moment.
[32:02.000 --> 32:05.000]  You guys give me that New York Times article again, What's Happening to the Sperm. Thanks.
[32:05.000 --> 32:08.000]  But let me go ahead and show you this stack and we're going to go to your calls.
[32:08.000 --> 32:11.000]  Here's a quote from George Washington.
[32:11.000 --> 32:23.000]  If the freedom of speech is taken away, then dumb and silent, we may be led like sheep to the slaughter.
[32:23.000 --> 32:28.000]  Here's the big story on info wars.com.
[32:28.000 --> 32:31.000]  Twitter says this is official.
[32:31.000 --> 32:38.000]  It purged dozens of accounts for undermining faith in NATO.
[32:38.000 --> 32:41.000]  You know, NATO gets caught smuggling kidnapped women or children.
[32:41.000 --> 32:43.000]  NATO gets caught dealing drugs.
[32:43.000 --> 32:45.000]  NATO gets caught stealing money.
[32:45.000 --> 32:51.000]  Well, that's not allowed because the Atlantic Council that runs the Biden administration and Obama.
[32:51.000 --> 32:57.000]  Is the Bilderberg group, Davos group system similar to the CFR.
[32:57.000 --> 33:03.000]  It's all the same group. People that are in the collateral commission or in the CFR or in the Atlantic Council.
[33:03.000 --> 33:07.000]  And it's got multinational group on these boards and they've got incredible power.
[33:07.000 --> 33:11.000]  It's the Atlantic Council that's quarterbacked a lot of the censorship.
[33:11.000 --> 33:14.000]  Like they said three years ago, they said, Oh, don't worry, we're going to get the liberals next.
[33:14.000 --> 33:18.000]  We're going to take all their speech too.
[33:18.000 --> 33:22.000]  So continuing Glenn Greenwald put out this tweet.
[33:22.000 --> 33:31.000]  It took only two years to go from disappearing Milo and Alex Jones to banning content.
[33:31.000 --> 33:36.000]  Said to amplify narratives that undermine faith in NATO.
[33:36.000 --> 33:37.000]  I'm allowed to do that.
[33:37.000 --> 33:40.000]  Imagine where the line will be in two years from now.
[33:40.000 --> 33:47.000]  Censorship is an intoxicating power that endlessly expands until it is smashed.
[33:47.000 --> 33:50.000]  Another RT article.
[33:50.000 --> 33:56.000]  It's not a defensive Alex Jones to argue that we're on a slippery slope to internet censorship.
[33:56.000 --> 34:02.000]  And they always talk about the strong men attacks on me that are never accurate.
[34:02.000 --> 34:05.000]  And then now this article out of red state.
[34:05.000 --> 34:13.000]  The bevy of books may be by by Amazon Institute's a moratorium on hate speech for written works.
[34:13.000 --> 34:17.000]  Scientific works about COVID-19 being an overblown hoax.
[34:17.000 --> 34:25.000]  Scientific works about the whole transgender movement being a worldwide sterilization plan hatched by the Tabistock Institute in the U.N.
[34:25.000 --> 34:32.000]  All of that is banned.
[34:32.000 --> 34:37.000]  And Sagar Injati has a good way of letting it out on Twitter.
[34:37.000 --> 34:40.000]  The groundwork to the platform Fox was laid by CNN a month ago.
[34:40.000 --> 34:44.000]  The groundwork to go after encryption is already laid by the New York Times.
[34:44.000 --> 34:48.000]  The case for full ISP blocks will appear soon.
[34:48.000 --> 34:56.000]  Each step up the ladder is an exponential threat to press freedom and our civic discourse.
[34:56.000 --> 34:57.000]  And that's exactly what this is.
[34:57.000 --> 34:58.000]  It's exponential.
[34:58.000 --> 35:02.000]  It's logarithmic like a earthquake.
[35:02.000 --> 35:12.000]  A one on a ripper scale is an order of magnitude bigger once it's a two.
[35:12.000 --> 35:16.000]  And then it goes up from there.
[35:16.000 --> 35:24.000]  And that leads us to this little gym from Paul Joseph Watson on m4wars.com.
[35:24.000 --> 35:32.000]  Facebook Algorithm accuses 81 year old grandmother of hate speech over knitted pigs comment.
[35:32.000 --> 35:33.000]  People don't even know what that means.
[35:33.000 --> 35:35.000]  It's like an old English term.
[35:35.000 --> 35:42.000]  Facebook Algorithm flagged any one year old grandmother's comments about knitted pigs as an example of hate speech and threatened her with a permanent ban.
[35:42.000 --> 35:57.000]  Yes, really, after losing her husband last year, Rita Richie McClatchy, a retired teacher who lives in Australia, created a Facebook page to share with the world her love of knitting and raised money for the Smith Family Charity, which helps us advance children.
[35:57.000 --> 36:12.000]  After posting a picture of her own knitted pigs, Richie McClatchy referred to them as white pigs and high Ziggs pigs, resulting in the threat to terminate or account over hate speeches for saying what color they were.
[36:12.000 --> 36:14.000]  And it's all mind control.
[36:14.000 --> 36:19.000]  It's about attacking language where you're superstitious and scared of all language.
[36:19.000 --> 36:27.000]  And that leads us next hour. I'm going to play that Coca-Cola training video where they teach you that being white is inherently bad.
[36:27.000 --> 36:31.000]  You must eradicate it and become less white.
[36:31.000 --> 36:32.000]  There's no bottom to that.
[36:32.000 --> 36:35.000]  They're teaching schoolchildren only see color.
[36:35.000 --> 36:38.000]  Do not be color blind.
[36:38.000 --> 36:50.000]  So if you make some pink pigs, you make some polka-dotted pigs, you are a racist when you do it to raise money for disadvantaged children or brain damaged children.
[36:50.000 --> 36:52.000]  I'm sure she'll apologize and behave herself.
[36:52.000 --> 37:06.000]  Now, let's move to this next piece of shock footage that Dan Dix, a great reporter and filmmaker who's been on the show many times, caught up in Canada where they have endless lockdowns.
[37:06.000 --> 37:08.000]  They have protests against it.
[37:08.000 --> 37:15.000]  So a group of men thug out and viciously tackle and viciously choke out.
[37:15.000 --> 37:19.000]  And it's just like George Floyd, he can't breathe.
[37:19.000 --> 37:21.000]  But when the cops beat up a white guy, it's okay.
[37:21.000 --> 37:22.000]  Or a black guy.
[37:22.000 --> 37:24.000]  We got the footage of black guys not wearing masks in New York.
[37:24.000 --> 37:28.000]  And man, the cops are just savagely beating them and choking them out.
[37:28.000 --> 37:33.000]  Everybody's like, you're heroes.
[37:33.000 --> 37:36.000]  Yeah, let's MMA this guy. Hell, let's kill him. Let's break his neck.
[37:36.000 --> 37:38.000]  Hell, they had killed him.
[37:38.000 --> 37:41.000]  Like Ashley Babbitt, they would have said it was an assault.
[37:41.000 --> 37:43.000]  The worst in World War II.
[37:43.000 --> 37:45.000]  And they were all victims.
[37:45.000 --> 37:47.000]  They had a broken neck, but they hurt him really bad.
[37:47.000 --> 37:51.000]  And this is just the system totally thugging out.
[37:51.000 --> 37:58.000]  And the very people that launched the attacks, the very people that launched the COVID system, the UN, Klaus Schwab Bill Gates.
[37:58.000 --> 38:03.000]  They're the ones up there, directing all of us how we should behave, what we should do.
[38:03.000 --> 38:06.000]  We're going to go to break and come back with that and then go to your phone calls.
[38:06.000 --> 38:13.000]  For about 45 minutes, I have a Tom Pappert joining us on AT&T, working with the Commerce, Chinese, Carlson, covering all that.
[38:13.000 --> 38:19.000]  We have another guest joining us, a state rep up in Connecticut with a lot of news that you don't want to miss as well.
[38:19.000 --> 38:22.000]  Separately, we, our listeners, support it.

[38:37.000 --> 38:38.000]  I mean, you've got to have it to live.
[38:38.000 --> 38:40.000]  It's for your cells, their function, their defense.
[38:40.000 --> 38:41.000]  It's there.

[40:04.000 --> 40:05.000]  food, and medicine.
[40:05.000 --> 40:10.000]  And with the blackouts we've seen that are guaranteed to be engineered to bring in federal
[40:10.000 --> 40:12.000]  and globalist control.
[40:12.000 --> 40:18.600]  We have seen massive lines of people lined up at the few grocery stores and restaurants
[40:18.600 --> 40:23.500]  that were open, and most of them getting turned away after hours of freezing in the cold.
[40:23.500 --> 40:27.480]  We've seen millions of people sleeping in their cars because they don't have any power
[40:27.480 --> 40:29.480]  in their house and then running out of gas.
[40:29.480 --> 40:34.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, energy is king, and food is the energy our bodies run off of and water
[40:34.240 --> 40:35.240]  as well.
[40:35.240 --> 40:38.120]  They're both available, the highest quality water filtration, and the highest quality

[40:55.720 --> 40:58.720]  Big discounts for only a few more days.
[40:58.720 --> 41:02.920]  Throughout history there have been two basic forms of civilizations, a different mix of
[41:02.920 --> 41:03.920]  the two.
[41:03.920 --> 41:06.840]  One is born of Renaissance, the other is born of conquest.
[41:06.840 --> 41:12.480]  One bases its power on having a strong, enlightened, focused people with an ethos and a culture
[41:12.480 --> 41:15.880]  and ingenuity, art and skill and strength.
[41:15.880 --> 41:21.160]  The other is based on the massive number of slaves it controls with a tiny elite above
[41:21.160 --> 41:22.160]  it.
[41:22.160 --> 41:27.400]  America is transferring out of a system based on the ethos of liberty and freedom into one
[41:27.400 --> 41:29.840]  of total mass high-tech slavery.
[41:29.840 --> 41:33.960]  That's why the globalists tell us America was founded on slavery when it wasn't.
[41:33.960 --> 41:37.760]  They point out one of our evils so they can invert the facts that they are truly the slave
[41:37.760 --> 41:38.760]  masters.
[41:38.760 --> 41:42.760]  A global permanent lockdown is here that is already causing millions and millions of
[41:42.760 --> 41:44.000]  starve to death.
[41:44.000 --> 41:46.200]  When they're done, billions will starve to death.
[41:46.200 --> 41:49.840]  Even the former head of the Ministry of Defense in England and a top general have come out
[41:49.840 --> 41:54.080]  and said the COVID lockdown is going to trigger a giant new world war.
[41:54.080 --> 41:55.080]  That's the facts.
[41:55.080 --> 41:59.120]  This is the Bill Gates New World Order weapon.
[41:59.120 --> 42:01.200]  I knew Trump was in battle.
[42:01.200 --> 42:07.680]  I knew he was surrounded by cowards and by double-talking agents of the enemy.
[42:07.680 --> 42:10.440]  A lot of people just couldn't believe it.
[42:10.440 --> 42:14.800]  They're like, oh no, it's 3G chess, 5G chess, he's invincible.
[42:14.800 --> 42:18.000]  And I understand why people wanted to believe that because this is scary what's going on.
[42:18.000 --> 42:20.000]  The global government in the New World Order.
[42:20.000 --> 42:23.880]  Now that people hold up the facts that's real, they won't somebody to come save them from.
[42:23.880 --> 42:25.880]  Well, Trump sure is held trot.
[42:25.880 --> 42:27.040]  My gosh, look it out.
[42:27.040 --> 42:30.880]  Prescription drug prices just tripled for quadruple, depending on the drug once you find
[42:30.880 --> 42:31.880]  that executive order.
[42:31.880 --> 42:36.720]  We pay the most of anybody in the world, that's just one case of hundreds of things that
[42:36.720 --> 42:37.720]  Trump had reversed.
[42:37.720 --> 42:41.520]  And now people are going to feel the sting and the pain, the energy cost, everything
[42:41.520 --> 42:42.520]  else.
[42:42.520 --> 42:46.680]  But what's really illustrated this is the trial to the Senate where Trump's own lawyers
[42:46.680 --> 42:51.360]  are attacking him and putting him down and saying he lost the election and just engaged
[42:51.360 --> 42:56.640]  in all sorts of criminal activity because the fix is in, folks, the swamp is deep.
[42:56.640 --> 42:59.840]  Trump fought it, but it's up to us to win it.
[42:59.840 --> 43:04.800]  The entire New World Order system is about making you feel pathetic, making you feel
[43:04.800 --> 43:09.520]  weak, making you play the part of a victim so you don't take your birthright as being
[43:09.520 --> 43:15.320]  made the image of God and the incredible mission and destiny we have being given free will.
[43:15.320 --> 43:21.360]  Being given free will, being given consciousness is literally the seed of an entire universe,
[43:21.360 --> 43:22.360]  an entire system.
[43:22.360 --> 43:26.480]  And the fact that you're able to commune with God, the fact that you're able to see
[43:26.480 --> 43:30.880]  the beauty of the sunset, or the beauty of the waves in the ocean, or the beauty of your
[43:30.880 --> 43:35.840]  life, your husband, or the beauty of your child learning knowledge, the beauty of music,
[43:35.840 --> 43:40.760]  the fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic, and that itself
[43:40.760 --> 43:43.560]  is what God teaches us is worship.
[43:43.560 --> 43:48.160]  So don't worship the globalist, don't worship the NFL, don't worship all the things of
[43:48.160 --> 43:53.160]  the system, but worship the things of God because we're made by God and appreciate your
[43:53.160 --> 43:58.360]  consciousness and appreciate pre-speech while you still have it, while you still have it.
[44:23.160 --> 44:27.840]  From the front lines of the Information War, I'm your host, Alex Jones, coming up next
[44:27.840 --> 44:34.080]  hour, your phone calls and report China's subjected U.S. diplomats to anal coronavirus
[44:34.080 --> 44:35.080]  test.
[44:35.080 --> 44:39.520]  And the U.S. says they're getting ready to adopt it to make you submit to your body
[44:39.520 --> 44:47.160]  being penetrated, so your body belongs to the state, belongs to your daddy, Bill Gates.
[44:47.160 --> 44:49.480]  Unbelievable, that's all coming up.
[44:49.480 --> 44:56.800]  Here is the footage, it's up on infowars.com, man without mask, assaulted, tackled by mask
[44:56.800 --> 45:03.400]  Nazis in Chimta, he's in a tire store, and the men just come up, beat the hell out of
[45:03.400 --> 45:07.480]  them, start choking him, trying to kill him, because they're heroes.
[45:07.480 --> 45:08.480]  Why?
[45:08.480 --> 45:13.680]  Because you know there's death everywhere and everybody's got a quarantine forever and
[45:13.680 --> 45:14.680]  they're heroes.
[45:14.680 --> 45:20.240]  This is how fascism works, this is how communism works, this is how Maoism works as they get
[45:20.240 --> 45:22.040]  all these useful idiot morons.
[45:22.040 --> 45:27.800]  Go out and do this effect, now people are getting COVID tattoos with the serial numbers
[45:27.800 --> 45:30.280]  of the vaccine they got, very proud to show it off.
[45:30.280 --> 45:38.000]  Hey, dumbasses, hey, dipshits, got some news for you dummies, they're saying, oh, you still
[45:38.000 --> 45:41.600]  got to wear a mask, you still got a social distance, the vaccine doesn't work, there'll
[45:41.600 --> 45:45.960]  be vaccines every month, it never ends, because you're schmucks, because you buy into the
[45:45.960 --> 45:53.040]  lie, because you get off on how you're a hero when you do the mass psychology.
[45:53.040 --> 46:03.160]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to the physical violent assault by five low grade morons that
[46:03.160 --> 46:05.680]  literally try to kill this guy, here it is.
[46:05.680 --> 46:23.000]  Hey, heroes, look at this, it's on the leaf, hey, heroes, hey, heroes, hey, heroes,
[46:23.000 --> 46:24.000]  hey, heroes.
[46:24.000 --> 46:51.320]  This is so widespread that Dan Dix is even trying to catch this himself, he's got it
[46:51.320 --> 46:56.760]  hanging around, choking him, he's got somebody easy like that.
[46:56.760 --> 47:10.600]  Get that terrorist, kill him, get him, get him, he's a terrorist, you notice they're
[47:10.600 --> 47:17.960]  not social distancing, you're going to wear the mask or we're going to kill you, of course
[47:17.960 --> 47:23.360]  you can't read, we're going to put a poison in you and kill you, we're liberals, back
[47:23.360 --> 47:32.360]  it up 30 seconds, back it up 30 seconds, on the video, back it up 30 seconds, thanks,
[47:32.360 --> 47:36.280]  I don't want to talk over, don't you to hear him begging for his life as they choke him
[47:36.280 --> 47:41.020]  and bend his arms behind his back, a bunch of moron thugs that watch MMA all day and
[47:41.020 --> 47:51.720]  think that they're rock lezner, they're trying to choke him, how did he pass out, one time
[47:51.720 --> 48:10.640]  back to that store I'll tell you that one, let's do the hell out of them, they're females,
[48:10.640 --> 48:28.000]  they're trying to choke him, they're trying to choke him, they're trying to choke him,
[48:28.000 --> 48:51.800]  they're trying to choke him, they're trying to choke him, they're trying to choke him,
[48:51.800 --> 49:01.320]  yes no one's choking you, no one's assaulting you, no one's breaking your arms, we're all
[49:01.320 --> 49:07.400]  heroes, of course then they call the police over the zip time like he's done something
[49:07.400 --> 49:19.320]  wrong, they're all heroes though, it's Canadian tire folks, if you are in the tyranny and
[49:19.320 --> 49:23.360]  into being physically assaulted, well that's the place for you, they're all a bunch of
[49:23.360 --> 49:28.280]  heroes there, and if you read the article it's really important you should share it,
[49:28.280 --> 49:31.840]  we show the British government, other governments saying masks don't protect you, they're not
[49:31.840 --> 49:36.000]  associated with decreased risk, they are nothing but a symbol that we're dirty and bad, we've
[49:36.000 --> 49:42.680]  got all the statistics right here for you, but they don't care because they're heroes,
[49:42.680 --> 49:48.240]  meanwhile DC elites call cops on truck with don't tread on me plates fearing it may be
[49:48.240 --> 49:55.680]  an insurrectionist vehicle and the police go after them, pro-Trump terrorists trampled
[49:55.680 --> 50:02.200]  the death in US capitol was carrying don't tread on me flag, and that's the big news
[50:02.200 --> 50:08.000]  by the mother of the police officer that died of a stroke days later, she said my son was
[50:08.000 --> 50:14.400]  not attacked, I don't want his memory being used in a lie, his mother has come out and
[50:14.400 --> 50:18.840]  said that it's not true that her son is being used for political reasons, he didn't get
[50:18.840 --> 50:21.800]  attacked, he didn't get hit in the head with a fire extinguisher, but they don't care
[50:21.800 --> 50:27.920]  now, it was the most deadly attack in US history worse than Pearl Harbor in 9-11, according
[50:27.920 --> 50:34.000]  to Chuck Schumer because four citizens got killed, a woman got shot in the neck and died
[50:34.000 --> 50:40.360]  and so Chuck Schumer needs your guns, look at the footage, the most deadly attack in
[50:40.360 --> 50:46.400]  US history, I'm told that old lady with the flag didn't even touch anybody, I'm told
[50:46.400 --> 50:52.000]  they're going to indict her I guess, so that's how it all works, the hero FBI though, they'll
[50:52.000 --> 50:58.160]  save us won't they, but oh when George Floyd gets choked it's terrible, which I didn't
[50:58.160 --> 51:01.520]  like it, it was terrible, but oh what somebody else does when he's not wearing a mask, it's
[51:01.520 --> 51:07.280]  heroic, alright we have Aaron in Florida, I'm going to start with Aaron and go to the
[51:07.280 --> 51:11.160]  next hour, I asked the question, what do you think of the letter Pelosi already asked
[51:11.160 --> 51:14.280]  for the new codes from Trump, she said she should have him, not the executive branches
[51:14.280 --> 51:18.440]  of the Constitution, but now the Democrats is what the launch codes they say that Biden
[51:18.440 --> 51:23.080]  can't be trusted with him, so right away the 25th amendment is unfolding here, here's
[51:23.080 --> 51:27.720]  a letter for TV viewers that want to see it, it says the attorney general, I guess it's
[51:27.720 --> 51:32.040]  a general now, he will decide, I mean not a military general, we don't want that either,
[51:32.040 --> 51:35.400]  it's the commander in chief that's elected that does that in an emergency, or if missiles
[51:35.400 --> 51:39.560]  have been fired, they want to tie our hands so we can't do that, let's go ahead and go
[51:39.560 --> 51:46.880]  to Aaron who was a nuclear missile technician for the Navy, Aaron what is your view on this?
[51:46.880 --> 51:54.240]  Okay, try it again, we're going to Aaron in Florida, Aaron can you hear me?
[51:54.240 --> 52:00.640]  Yes sir, I'm here, go ahead please, thank you, I'm just concerned about this group of dangerous
[52:00.640 --> 52:07.640]  advance all coming together, the new code transition effectively removes our entire nuclear deterrent
[52:07.640 --> 52:14.600]  from being able to defend us or protect us, did I articulate it correctly or if not explained
[52:14.600 --> 52:19.280]  us what's saying that we have to have a committee of people meet before we can defend ourselves,
[52:19.280 --> 52:22.120]  doesn't that invite a nuclear first strike?
[52:22.120 --> 52:25.760]  Absolutely it does, you cannot respond quickly, you've got 11 minutes, well I shouldn't
[52:25.760 --> 52:31.400]  probably say that, but anyways you've got a short very short period of time to respond
[52:31.400 --> 52:36.000]  to any incoming attack, so that along with the Secretary of Defense doing a 60 day stand
[52:36.000 --> 52:41.880]  down for white supremacy review in conjunction with Chinese military training in Canada for
[52:41.880 --> 52:46.480]  winter ops and Central America for jungle ops and having a beachhead in Los Angeles,
[52:46.480 --> 52:50.280]  I believe we're being set up for a coordinated attack.
[52:50.280 --> 52:54.280]  I told the crew during the power outage I said my gut level is we're being set up for
[52:54.280 --> 53:00.080]  a sneak attack and my gut's never wrong, I'm going to have nightmares about it brother.
[53:00.080 --> 53:03.560]  I just, all I can say is be ready.
[53:03.560 --> 53:07.560]  Well explain to people about mutually assured destruction and how it's actually worked since
[53:07.560 --> 53:11.000]  the nightmare of nuclear weapons was developed as we were in a race with the Germans to develop
[53:11.000 --> 53:14.760]  it in World War II, explain to people how this works if they needed to go to Congress,
[53:14.760 --> 53:18.480]  the Attorney General and have a big pow wow and half these Congress people are Chinese
[53:18.480 --> 53:19.480]  agents.
[53:19.480 --> 53:26.240]  Well it cannot happen like that, if you start taking an incoming fire, like I said you've
[53:26.240 --> 53:32.920]  got very limited time and to try to get a group of people to have a concurrence on any event
[53:32.920 --> 53:37.920]  especially Lib Tards, I mean what do you think is going to happen?
[53:37.920 --> 53:42.480]  Well plus you can't have the Attorney General as under jurisdiction, they're not above
[53:42.480 --> 53:46.480]  the President and that's the preparation of powers, I mean since George Washington that's
[53:46.480 --> 53:50.360]  the Commander in Chief, so this is Congress really encroaching on the executive and our
[53:50.360 --> 53:53.680]  security and it shows what power grabbers they are.
[53:53.680 --> 53:58.440]  Just like you said it is an actual coup, they are taking over, it's unconstitutional and
[53:58.440 --> 54:03.160]  somebody somewhere, something and us, all of us together has got to do something to stop
[54:03.160 --> 54:04.160]  this.
[54:04.160 --> 54:08.480]  Or you might as well go ahead and raise the red Chinese flag on every flagpole in the
[54:08.480 --> 54:10.480]  United States.
[54:10.480 --> 54:17.200]  Sir I totally agree with you 100% and again America thinks we're invincible, we're not
[54:17.200 --> 54:25.600]  invincible if we have been infiltrated from within, it's just that simple.
[54:25.600 --> 54:29.080]  The electrical meters on your house are made in China, guess what they can turn them off
[54:29.080 --> 54:33.200]  with a flick of a switch, put the entire nation in absolute grid blackout.
[54:33.200 --> 54:36.840]  And that's what Snowden exposed, thank you so much.
[54:36.840 --> 54:41.200]  We are being set up America and the average leftist loves it, they think Gigi Fink cares
[54:41.200 --> 54:42.200]  about them.
[54:42.200 --> 54:47.840]  Well they're right back with hour number two, stay with us.
[54:47.840 --> 54:51.160]  Ladies and gentlemen Owen Schreuer here the host of the Info Wars War Room and I have
[54:51.160 --> 54:58.240]  had a major wake up call living in Texas this last week about how important storable food
[54:58.240 --> 54:59.240]  is.
[54:59.240 --> 55:04.080]  Now I have plenty of storable food in my house but my notion has always been this is last
[55:04.080 --> 55:09.760]  case scenario worst case scenario like end of America apocalyptic type of scenario but
[55:09.760 --> 55:12.080]  I'm realizing now that's not the case.
[55:12.080 --> 55:16.120]  Folks they can shut off the power, they can shut off the water at any given moment.
[55:16.120 --> 55:20.200]  Now I was lucky I had plenty of food in my fridge and in my pantry that I didn't have
[55:20.200 --> 55:24.400]  to dig into my storable food but many people in Texas did it.
[55:24.400 --> 55:28.200]  Don't be in that situation, don't have that major wake up call when they come to shut
[55:28.200 --> 55:33.560]  down your power and they shut down the stores and the food supply, have the backup, have
[55:33.560 --> 55:38.840]  the insurance and be ready to feed yourself, your family, your friends and your neighbors
[55:38.840 --> 55:48.960]  with the storable food, best quality, best price, 10% off right now at infowarstore.com.
[55:48.960 --> 55:55.920]  As negative as times are right now and as depressing as things can be you have to understand
[55:55.920 --> 56:03.240]  that this is all a test, this experience, this wife on this planet is a reckoning.
[56:03.240 --> 56:08.520]  It's God giving us a chance to work things out in the third dimension so we can decide
[56:08.520 --> 56:12.800]  where we want to spend eternity and what level we want to go to and it really does come
[56:12.800 --> 56:13.800]  down to that.
[56:13.800 --> 56:18.120]  So as sad as things are and as evil as things are look at all the good in the world as well
[56:18.120 --> 56:22.120]  and realize that God is the author of our consciousness.
[56:22.120 --> 56:25.720]  God is the author of us having our own will.
[56:25.720 --> 56:31.400]  God is the author of us having free will and that free will is a beautiful thing.
[56:31.400 --> 56:35.520]  When you look at mainstream media in Hollywood and this whole evil culture in Washington
[56:35.520 --> 56:40.840]  D.C. and Fauci and the mass cult, it's all about dominating your free will.
[56:40.840 --> 56:44.480]  It's all about telling you you're dirty, you're ugly, you're in bed because Satan
[56:44.480 --> 56:51.800]  hates you because you're made in the image of God, the creator of the universe.
[56:51.800 --> 57:05.880]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[57:05.880 --> 57:31.240]  Coming up, I got Nancy Pelosi saying she wants tanks with machine guns at the Capitol and
[57:31.240 --> 57:37.280]  she never wants them to go away.
[57:37.280 --> 57:47.560]  The founder of the greater rock and roll right there.
[57:47.560 --> 57:48.560]  I just listen to good music.
[57:48.560 --> 57:49.560]  I'm colorblind like that.
[57:49.560 --> 57:56.520]  I'm told by the Democrats, the color commercial that's coming up that I'm supposed to only
[57:56.520 --> 57:58.000]  pay attention to what color people are.
[57:58.000 --> 58:02.560]  Not the content of what they do, not the character of their deeds like Martin Luther
[58:02.560 --> 58:09.720]  King said, they must be the good guys, right, Coca-Cola and Cartoon Network and Democrats.
[58:09.720 --> 58:13.920]  But the big story here is nuclear doctrine has been figured out.
[58:13.920 --> 58:15.920]  You got to have mutually assured destruction.
[58:15.920 --> 58:16.920]  Somebody fires first.
[58:16.920 --> 58:17.920]  You got to have early warning.
[58:17.920 --> 58:19.600]  You got to let them know they're going to be destroyed as well.
[58:19.600 --> 58:21.080]  That's why they don't do it.
[58:21.080 --> 58:25.000]  It's why thieves don't rob a lot of houses, say in Texas with the lights on because most
[58:25.000 --> 58:26.000]  folks got guns.
[58:26.000 --> 58:29.440]  So you got 10 times the crime in Chicago or New York where they know you don't have guns
[58:29.440 --> 58:30.880]  most of the time.
[58:30.880 --> 58:31.880]  It's called a deterrent.
[58:31.880 --> 58:37.040]  It's like, why don't you see people assaulting police stations very often because it's full
[58:37.040 --> 58:42.160]  of men, at least it was in the past, most of them veterans with guns.
[58:42.160 --> 58:45.360]  Same reason you don't stick your tallywacker in a beehive.
[58:45.360 --> 58:48.320]  Excuse my French.
[58:48.320 --> 58:51.640]  And so now America is a sitting duck and I can tell you that Biden doesn't know what
[58:51.640 --> 58:56.680]  the planet is on, they've already got a consortium of globalists in control of those codes.
[58:56.680 --> 58:58.280]  And we're just in deep trouble.
[58:58.280 --> 59:03.400]  And I don't say that to be like, oh, it's over.
[59:03.400 --> 59:05.200]  We have to recognize how much trouble we're in.
[59:05.200 --> 59:08.480]  All right, this has been all the longest now.
[59:08.480 --> 59:12.160]  Let's go ahead and talk to Paul in California.
[59:12.160 --> 59:13.160]  Paul, welcome.
[59:13.160 --> 59:14.160]  Go ahead.
[59:14.160 --> 59:15.160]  Give us your take.
[59:15.160 --> 59:21.920]  The take is, I don't know if they're giving the nuclear football to the Democrats or if
[59:21.920 --> 59:28.720]  there's going to be many nuclear football, in which case there's just more problems as
[59:28.720 --> 59:33.040]  far as security, but also another problem.
[59:33.040 --> 59:34.640]  Yeah, you know, that's what it is.
[59:34.640 --> 59:40.360]  It says FEMA will have a bunch of footballs and they'll all have to sync up in live time.
[59:40.360 --> 59:42.160]  The Chai comms came up with this for sure.
[59:42.160 --> 59:46.120]  This is Chai comms, GZ pinged at this as another loyalty test.
[59:46.120 --> 59:49.800]  Go on TV and say, we can invade Hong Kong and death camps are good.
[59:49.800 --> 59:52.200]  If you can invade Hong Kong, death camps are good.
[59:52.200 --> 59:54.760]  Now give us the nuclear football, give it to our Chinese agents.
[59:54.760 --> 59:57.600]  That's it, brother.
[59:57.600 --> 1:00:03.640]  Anyway, another thought though, should there be an explosion at the White House, the football
[1:00:03.640 --> 1:00:10.720]  would go with the president and we would be perhaps even more open to problems.
[1:00:10.720 --> 1:00:15.400]  Well, absolutely, you know, the media makes jokes about the Air Force and everybody with
[1:00:15.400 --> 1:00:18.000]  the new codes and Marines.
[1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:21.280]  You've got at least a dozen countries with nuclear weapons, five of them aiming weapons
[1:00:21.280 --> 1:00:22.280]  at us.
[1:00:22.280 --> 1:00:26.640]  You've got submarines off our coast, satellites in space, and GZ pinged making jokes about
[1:00:26.640 --> 1:00:29.800]  all this and saying they can survive a nuclear war with us.
[1:00:29.800 --> 1:00:33.640]  And then they're like, oh, why does Trump, why does the president need a nuclear launch
[1:00:33.640 --> 1:00:34.640]  code with him?
[1:00:34.640 --> 1:00:35.640]  That's warlike.
[1:00:35.640 --> 1:00:40.080]  We need to, again, it's the fact that we have the weapons is why we haven't been attacked.
[1:00:40.080 --> 1:00:41.560]  I'm sad the weapons are there.
[1:00:41.560 --> 1:00:45.240]  I wish they were never invented, but we're in this world, you know.
[1:00:45.240 --> 1:00:51.920]  Yeah, another thought is, I don't know if I believe I heard that the Federal Reserve
[1:00:51.920 --> 1:00:56.840]  went down computer-wise, so if somebody hacked the Federal Reserve.
[1:00:56.840 --> 1:00:57.840]  I saw that.
[1:00:57.840 --> 1:00:59.520]  Yeah, the Federal Reserve's computer system's down.
[1:00:59.520 --> 1:01:00.520]  That's what I mean.
[1:01:00.520 --> 1:01:02.680]  This whole thing's a mess.
[1:01:02.680 --> 1:01:08.160]  Because somebody did whatever they felt like doing with Federal Reserve, we got to end
[1:01:08.160 --> 1:01:09.160]  it.
[1:01:09.160 --> 1:01:14.840]  What are under Cheney out of Minot, North Dakota, and all those missing cruise missiles?
[1:01:14.840 --> 1:01:23.320]  And they also just had the marine weapons that are explosive missing, some kind of drill
[1:01:23.320 --> 1:01:24.320]  or whatever.
[1:01:24.320 --> 1:01:25.320]  Yeah, I don't know.
[1:01:25.320 --> 1:01:30.680]  I mean, this country's losing its organization, it's losing its will, it's losing its organizational
[1:01:30.680 --> 1:01:35.960]  skills, it's losing its honor, and we are becoming a banana republic with nuclear weapons
[1:01:35.960 --> 1:01:41.040]  very, very quickly, with crazy Alzheimer's patient as the President.
[1:01:41.040 --> 1:01:44.960]  Thank you so much, Paul, but the left thinks that's better to have somebody managing things
[1:01:44.960 --> 1:01:48.240]  like that than somebody that actually cared, so they stole the election.
[1:01:48.240 --> 1:01:56.920]  Back in 60 seconds with more phone calls, I'm Alex Jones, stay with us.
[1:01:56.920 --> 1:02:01.120]  Finally, Vitamin D3 and Vitamin K that are both essential are getting the respect and
[1:02:01.120 --> 1:02:02.840]  the attention they deserve.
[1:02:02.840 --> 1:02:06.200]  We've got a great product, it's been out for six years, winter sun.
[1:02:06.200 --> 1:02:10.120]  Long before the big crisis came along, we were there saying, this is high quality, this
[1:02:10.120 --> 1:02:12.640]  will make you healthy, this will be better for you and your family.
[1:02:12.640 --> 1:02:17.400]  But what else doesn't get attention, and needs to be looked at, is Vitamin B12.
[1:02:17.400 --> 1:02:22.200]  It is just as essential, it is just as important, and it is amazing, and it's not just about
[1:02:22.200 --> 1:02:25.720]  your immune system, it's about every part of your body.
[1:02:25.720 --> 1:02:30.640]  It's really a hormone, and it's what your building blocks of your entire body operate
[1:02:30.640 --> 1:02:31.640]  off of.
[1:02:31.640 --> 1:02:37.000]  So, these vitamins are essential, Vitamin D3, and of course, Vitamin B12 go together
[1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:41.320]  like a horse, and carriage, do your own research, we've got the highest grades you're going
[1:02:41.320 --> 1:02:43.680]  to find out there, and they're taken under the tongue.
[1:02:43.680 --> 1:02:48.120]  It's key to put it under the tongue for about a minute, and let it sit so your blood vessels
[1:02:48.120 --> 1:02:49.120]  absorb it.
[1:02:49.120 --> 1:02:54.880]  They're both available 50% off at infowarstore.com together, or by themselves at 50% off and
[1:02:54.880 --> 1:03:14.680]  25% off.
[1:03:14.680 --> 1:03:21.520]  We're now into hour number two on this Thursday, February 25, 2021, transmission.
[1:03:21.520 --> 1:03:26.600]  These nationalist, populist Christian communications, whether it's focused on the family or live
[1:03:26.600 --> 1:03:35.720]  site, or now even CPAC, because they're daring to have Trump speak coming up in just a few
[1:03:35.720 --> 1:03:36.720]  days.
[1:03:36.720 --> 1:03:40.080]  They're all being banned off Facebook and Twitter now, and even links that other people
[1:03:40.080 --> 1:03:44.520]  promote are being banned, yet to understand, we're going into tyranny.
[1:03:44.520 --> 1:03:45.520]  This is a takeover.
[1:03:45.520 --> 1:03:50.080]  This is a multinational consortium that put China in power, gave China one-sided trade
[1:03:50.080 --> 1:03:55.720]  deals, built them up to where their GDP is already bigger than ours in reality, and now
[1:03:55.720 --> 1:03:58.840]  they're going to put things in place where we cannot do business, and they're cutting
[1:03:58.840 --> 1:04:04.160]  our power off.
[1:04:04.160 --> 1:04:08.000]  I don't like to sit here and tell you horrible things like this.
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:18.200]  I don't like to sit up here and say things like this, but that's where we are.
[1:04:18.200 --> 1:04:23.680]  You can find people to lie to you all day and say, oh, Q is actually still real.
[1:04:23.680 --> 1:04:25.480]  March 4th, Trump will be inaugurated.
[1:04:25.480 --> 1:04:33.760]  Well, you just hold your breath again and see what happens coming up in nine days, or
[1:04:33.760 --> 1:04:40.000]  I guess last February, short eight days, seven days, and it's like, why don't you be positive,
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  Alex?
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:43.960]  Well, I can't get up on top of a 50-story building and just jump off on a parachute and say,
[1:04:43.960 --> 1:04:49.520]  I've got wings, I'm positive.
[1:04:49.520 --> 1:04:54.640]  Like a coyote, you know, when he thinks he's got wings and loony tubes, he falls to the
[1:04:54.640 --> 1:04:59.880]  bottom and hurts his little head.
[1:04:59.880 --> 1:05:04.880]  So now they wanted the nuclear codes from Trump on January 8th.
[1:05:04.880 --> 1:05:10.040]  The military didn't take him away, that'd be a coup, and now Pelosi says, well, I want
[1:05:10.040 --> 1:05:14.320]  him again, and I want the Attorney General, because he's a general, she said, not the
[1:05:14.320 --> 1:05:20.680]  military, but a general, a lawyer, a really sneaky, evil, chai-com agent, to have him.
[1:05:20.680 --> 1:05:25.800]  Here's the letter, a whole bunch of Chinese communist agents, Swallows, well, all of them,
[1:05:25.800 --> 1:05:26.800]  on there.
[1:05:26.800 --> 1:05:31.920]  Here it is, even Town Hall has a story, but they kind of spin it like, oh, because they
[1:05:31.920 --> 1:05:33.120]  don't trust Biden.
[1:05:33.120 --> 1:05:39.200]  But see, by having an Adel, Alzheimer dementia patient in there, it strengthens the hand
[1:05:39.200 --> 1:05:42.280]  of, well, he's got to have people take care of him now.
[1:05:42.280 --> 1:05:43.280]  That's why they did it.
[1:05:43.280 --> 1:05:47.280]  When they want, they can then sell the highest bidder, who the new president's going to be.
[1:05:47.280 --> 1:05:51.720]  Who's going to be the new vice president under Kamala, and then she can go.
[1:05:51.720 --> 1:05:57.600]  See, this is the bureaucracy wanting to be president, wanting to be generals.
[1:05:57.600 --> 1:06:01.720]  Dozens of Democrats are worried about Biden having singular authority to order use of
[1:06:01.720 --> 1:06:04.920]  nuclear weapons, but if you actually read it, they talk about singular authority for
[1:06:04.920 --> 1:06:10.400]  a first strike, but they're talking about a strike, period, because they don't count
[1:06:10.400 --> 1:06:18.520]  in their definition missiles in the air, cruise missiles in the air as the enemy striking.
[1:06:18.520 --> 1:06:26.720]  They want to wait till we're hit, and then it would be too late.
[1:06:26.720 --> 1:06:31.000]  Dozens of Democrat lawmakers asked Joe Biden to give up his president's sole authority
[1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:32.000]  to launch nuclear weapons.
[1:06:32.000 --> 1:06:33.000]  Well, I thought we elected him.
[1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:36.560]  Well, see, we really didn't elect him, so see, they're like, hey, you stole the election,
[1:06:36.560 --> 1:06:37.560]  we put him in.
[1:06:37.560 --> 1:06:38.560]  He belongs to us.
[1:06:38.560 --> 1:06:44.080]  Except for Nancy Pelosi warned of unhinged, Donald Trump could use them.
[1:06:44.080 --> 1:06:47.560]  Billy confirms Pelosi conversation business has been gone from talk of disarming Trump
[1:06:47.560 --> 1:06:56.080]  January 8th, and it goes on and on, and then we've got this video, go ahead and cue it
[1:06:56.080 --> 1:06:57.080]  up.
[1:06:57.080 --> 1:07:00.160]  Remember Pelosi, it was down to testify.
[1:07:00.160 --> 1:07:02.840]  She wanted machine guns out and loaded.
[1:07:02.840 --> 1:07:06.920]  She's like, why don't these armored vehicles, these hundreds of armored vehicles and hundreds
[1:07:06.920 --> 1:07:10.520]  of armored Humvees, why don't they have big machine guns on top?
[1:07:10.520 --> 1:07:12.520]  She's a general now, or a colonel.
[1:07:12.520 --> 1:07:16.360]  She's like strutting around, reviewing the troops, she's like, where's the weapons?
[1:07:16.360 --> 1:07:20.560]  Well, their magazines are right there in their pouches.
[1:07:20.560 --> 1:07:27.200]  Well, we'll get them out, lock and load, and that way somebody has an accident and discharges
[1:07:27.200 --> 1:07:28.200]  the farm.
[1:07:28.200 --> 1:07:31.200]  We want a war, and she even said a couple of days ago, we want a civil war.
[1:07:31.200 --> 1:07:33.440]  It's time to take it to these Republicans.
[1:07:33.440 --> 1:07:36.840]  Don't let them be at the restaurant or at their church or their house.
[1:07:36.840 --> 1:07:38.840]  Get out there and get them.
[1:07:38.840 --> 1:07:42.040]  Who ever said demonstrations are peaceful?
[1:07:42.040 --> 1:07:49.800]  We're going to go to your calls in a moment, but here is Nancy, the Chai-Com agent, Pelosi,
[1:07:49.800 --> 1:07:54.560]  and her minion, as she's related to him, I guess she's in the family, swallows well
[1:07:54.560 --> 1:07:55.560]  the Chinese agent.
[1:07:55.560 --> 1:08:01.040]  Here she is talking, a person testifying to Congress about what she wanted.
[1:08:01.040 --> 1:08:06.080]  I mean, you raise a great point, because when you think about all of that across the summer,
[1:08:06.080 --> 1:08:10.880]  and one of the most haunting images to me is the third precinct in Minneapolis, when
[1:08:10.880 --> 1:08:13.520]  it was basically just, they just moved out of it.
[1:08:13.520 --> 1:08:14.520]  The police moved out of it.
[1:08:14.520 --> 1:08:16.560]  In the middle of the night, it was set on fire.
[1:08:16.560 --> 1:08:23.800]  They basically escaped in their squad cars and didn't come back, and people were ransacking
[1:08:23.800 --> 1:08:24.800]  it.
[1:08:24.800 --> 1:08:27.120]  You know, there was all this discussion about, no, we don't want the National Guard for this
[1:08:27.120 --> 1:08:29.200]  instance, right?
[1:08:29.200 --> 1:08:33.160]  There in Seattle and Portland as well, discussion, don't send the National Guard to President
[1:08:33.160 --> 1:08:34.160]  Trump.
[1:08:34.160 --> 1:08:38.760]  Now, behind us, you've got a force that is several times the number that we have in
[1:08:38.760 --> 1:08:39.760]  Iraq and Afghanistan.
[1:08:39.760 --> 1:08:40.760]  A division.
[1:08:40.760 --> 1:08:41.760]  Make sense of that.
[1:08:41.760 --> 1:08:49.000]  You have a division, and the last up of thousands of these troops was requested by the speaker
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:50.840]  through the Capitol Police.
[1:08:50.840 --> 1:08:56.200]  She even wanted crew-manned machine guns in Washington.
[1:08:56.200 --> 1:09:01.800]  That was rejected because there's simply no use for that in a security arrangement for
[1:09:01.800 --> 1:09:05.360]  a civilian undertaking.
[1:09:05.360 --> 1:09:13.720]  So some of this has gone beyond any legitimate security need, but their discipline, their
[1:09:13.720 --> 1:09:19.720]  professional and secret service has been choreographing this very effectively to maintain security
[1:09:19.720 --> 1:09:20.720]  and safety.
[1:09:20.720 --> 1:09:22.840]  But you know, China is laughing at us right now.
[1:09:22.840 --> 1:09:23.840]  All right.
[1:09:23.840 --> 1:09:24.840]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[1:09:24.840 --> 1:09:28.920]  Right now, yes, that would be Mike and then James and others.
[1:09:28.920 --> 1:09:33.840]  Mike in California, what's your view on Biden and how the Democrats already want the nuclear
[1:09:33.840 --> 1:09:35.320]  codes for themselves?
[1:09:35.320 --> 1:09:36.320]  Pretty big constitutional crisis.
[1:09:36.320 --> 1:09:37.320]  What do you say?
[1:09:37.320 --> 1:09:44.600]  Yeah, I agree, Jones, and I just want to say I can't imagine Canada would be happy.
[1:09:44.600 --> 1:09:49.040]  You know, they see ICBM coming up over the Arctic, and the other countries in our nuclear
[1:09:49.040 --> 1:09:52.720]  umbrella are probably concerned about this as well.
[1:09:52.720 --> 1:09:58.760]  I just want to say that this is such a bad idea.
[1:09:58.760 --> 1:10:03.720]  The military industrial complex minions will be the ones who end up getting control of
[1:10:03.720 --> 1:10:04.720]  this.
[1:10:04.720 --> 1:10:08.240]  Same people that killed JFK and carried out 9-11, then they'll have leverage over the
[1:10:08.240 --> 1:10:11.000]  president and the American people.
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:17.160]  And I just want to say, I think Tucker was right last night when he said that the establishment
[1:10:17.160 --> 1:10:25.560]  is pushing race divisions and all this other BS for low IQ people to distract them.
[1:10:25.560 --> 1:10:31.120]  From the elites who have been stealing tens of trillions of dollars from us to build underground
[1:10:31.120 --> 1:10:35.880]  bases and secret space stuff and all the other crap that they do.
[1:10:35.880 --> 1:10:42.080]  And people just need to realize that the government is not there primarily to protect
[1:10:42.080 --> 1:10:48.040]  their... The government became its own corporate enterprise for world government.
[1:10:48.040 --> 1:10:51.920]  And Trump literally tried to reverse that and at least have our country survive.
[1:10:51.920 --> 1:10:56.360]  But the globalists don't want a free country when the rest of all the countries are enslaved.
[1:10:56.360 --> 1:11:00.800]  That's why there is a project to deindustrialize, turn us against ourselves, and make us hate
[1:11:00.800 --> 1:11:02.440]  ourselves, period.
[1:11:02.440 --> 1:11:03.440]  Exactly.
[1:11:03.440 --> 1:11:08.520]  And I try to talk to my mom and my sister, and they just don't get it.
[1:11:08.520 --> 1:11:11.320]  I try to talk to them nicely, but it's like you say sometimes.
[1:11:11.320 --> 1:11:17.480]  Like if I don't talk in a nice NPR voice, really soft, they'll just tune it out.
[1:11:17.480 --> 1:11:21.200]  And separately, I just wanted to say about the vaccine, that anybody who's concerned
[1:11:21.200 --> 1:11:28.520]  about it, they can refuse it because it's being distributed under emergency use authorization.
[1:11:28.520 --> 1:11:33.840]  So they can't require you to take it to go back to work or to whatever.
[1:11:33.840 --> 1:11:35.280]  Well it's all intimidation.
[1:11:35.280 --> 1:11:39.040]  People have to organize their own private health unions, their own human rights unions
[1:11:39.040 --> 1:11:40.480]  and say, this says it's dangerous.
[1:11:40.480 --> 1:11:41.480]  This is experimental.
[1:11:41.480 --> 1:11:42.480]  This wasn't even approved.
[1:11:42.480 --> 1:11:50.480]  And you're trying to bushwhack me into doing it in some virtue signal, and just say no.
[1:11:50.480 --> 1:11:53.720]  Or do the other thing and go, let's all wink, wink and say we got it.
[1:11:53.720 --> 1:11:56.600]  Most of the nurses know, and split them 100.
[1:11:56.600 --> 1:11:58.000]  I don't want to go that route.
[1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:01.240]  That's what the medical, you think most of the medical workers take that stuff?
[1:12:01.240 --> 1:12:02.240]  No, sir.
[1:12:02.240 --> 1:12:06.520]  That's why they want tests now, to see if you've taken it.
[1:12:06.520 --> 1:12:12.360]  Yeah, but no, but you know, Ted Cruz flew to Cancun, so we should focus on that.
[1:12:12.360 --> 1:12:13.360]  Well, that's right.
[1:12:13.360 --> 1:12:17.960]  I mean, Ted Cruz, he went down to Cancun when he did that power at his house, actually a
[1:12:17.960 --> 1:12:18.960]  smart move.
[1:12:18.960 --> 1:12:23.280]  No, he's a horrible person, but Obama's shutting down 100-plus power plants in Texas, and then
[1:12:23.280 --> 1:12:26.600]  the actual Department of Energy documents saying we couldn't turn up our power plants.
[1:12:26.600 --> 1:12:27.600]  That's okay.
[1:12:27.600 --> 1:12:28.600]  That's okay.
[1:12:28.600 --> 1:12:29.600]  I appreciate your call, Mike.
[1:12:29.600 --> 1:12:30.600]  You're a horrible person.
[1:12:30.600 --> 1:12:31.600]  Yeah, well, yeah.
[1:12:31.600 --> 1:12:32.600]  Mike, don't talk about it, Joe Biden.
[1:12:32.600 --> 1:12:33.600]  I'm joking.
[1:12:33.600 --> 1:12:37.760]  But James is up next, and then we've got so many others.
[1:12:37.760 --> 1:12:40.480]  We're taking your calls out of Tom Pappert joining us.
[1:12:40.480 --> 1:12:44.840]  Oh, he got a big story out on the Communist Chinese infiltration with AT&T and Tucker Carlson
[1:12:44.840 --> 1:12:45.840]  covered it last night.
[1:12:45.840 --> 1:12:47.360]  I'm really proud of National File.
[1:12:47.360 --> 1:12:52.960]  All right, we'll be right back with Infowars.com tomorrow's news today.
[1:12:52.960 --> 1:12:58.320]  I actually bought this in blocks, UHF frequency.
[1:12:58.320 --> 1:13:04.480]  Snowden and others taught us how mobile phones are constantly spying on us, not just tracking
[1:13:04.480 --> 1:13:11.640]  and recording our GPS location, but recording audio and video as well, with or without a
[1:13:11.640 --> 1:13:12.640]  battery.
[1:13:12.640 --> 1:13:18.880]  Now, with the Infowars privacy pouch, you can go dark wherever you choose.

[1:16:11.440 --> 1:16:12.440]  Don't fight.
[1:16:12.440 --> 1:16:13.440]  I love that Elvis.
[1:16:13.440 --> 1:16:15.440]  You know he had a heavy metal band?
[1:16:15.440 --> 1:16:17.440]  All right, let's get serious.
[1:16:17.440 --> 1:16:21.440]  Let's talk to Honey in Canada.
[1:16:21.440 --> 1:16:22.440]  Honey on the new codes.
[1:16:22.440 --> 1:16:25.440]  What do you make of Joe Biden?
[1:16:25.440 --> 1:16:26.440]  This is all timers now.
[1:16:26.440 --> 1:16:29.440]  They're openly getting ready to 25th Amendmentist, but what do you think is going to go down?
[1:16:29.440 --> 1:16:34.440]  Oh, it's definitely going to happen, but they also have to do some alarm because I believe
[1:16:34.440 --> 1:16:37.440]  you have a blast at 1 o'clock in the afternoon.
[1:16:37.440 --> 1:16:38.440]  Give me a favor.
[1:16:38.440 --> 1:16:40.440]  Your phone was clear earlier when they got you on.
[1:16:40.440 --> 1:16:43.440]  It's going to be better right now because the iPhone isn't like, it's the next start.
[1:16:43.440 --> 1:16:44.440]  No, it's terrible.
[1:16:44.440 --> 1:16:45.440]  I know.
[1:16:45.440 --> 1:16:46.440]  It's better now.
[1:16:46.440 --> 1:16:47.440]  Start over.
[1:16:47.440 --> 1:16:48.440]  Yeah.
[1:16:48.440 --> 1:16:52.440]  Well, Joe Biden is autonomous, so he's like half robot anyway.
[1:16:52.440 --> 1:16:55.440]  So I think they actually could keep him alive longer than people think.
[1:16:55.440 --> 1:16:56.440]  That's Microsoft.
[1:16:56.440 --> 1:17:02.440]  But yeah, like he's got like lots of, you know, medical assistance with that, but they
[1:17:02.440 --> 1:17:06.440]  will, you know, eventually do it, but blackouts will happen before that, you know?
[1:17:06.440 --> 1:17:07.440]  Well, I agree with you.
[1:17:07.440 --> 1:17:10.440]  A lot of people ask, why would they want a brain dead puppet up there?
[1:17:10.440 --> 1:17:11.440]  Because they can do anything they want.
[1:17:11.440 --> 1:17:13.440]  And then he gets the blame later.
[1:17:13.440 --> 1:17:17.440]  And by the time anybody ever tries to charge him, he's dead.
[1:17:17.440 --> 1:17:19.440]  Of course, like there's no accountability.
[1:17:19.440 --> 1:17:24.440]  There's no justice, you know, there's nothing in response to whatever is going to go down,
[1:17:24.440 --> 1:17:28.440]  which power grid, you know, food supply chains, the end of the nation state itself, like
[1:17:28.440 --> 1:17:29.440]  Chinese takeover.
[1:17:29.440 --> 1:17:31.440]  You know, what, what are you going to do to Joe Biden?
[1:17:31.440 --> 1:17:33.440]  He's on his way out, you know?
[1:17:33.440 --> 1:17:34.440]  I agree.
[1:17:34.440 --> 1:17:35.440]  I'll say this about Lindsey Graham.
[1:17:35.440 --> 1:17:36.440]  I don't like him.
[1:17:36.440 --> 1:17:40.440]  He was a minion of John McCain, but he's gotten a lot better saying we should support Trump,
[1:17:40.440 --> 1:17:43.440]  saying Joe Biden's a puppet, saying he's a Chinese agent.
[1:17:43.440 --> 1:17:48.440]  I mean, Lindsey Graham is, is actually growing, growing a little bit of a wave.
[1:17:48.440 --> 1:17:50.440]  What do you think of that?
[1:17:50.440 --> 1:17:52.440]  He probably just knows the national security threat.
[1:17:52.440 --> 1:17:56.440]  I think he knows, like, really what's going on and like, he doesn't want to alarm people
[1:17:56.440 --> 1:17:57.440]  too much.
[1:17:57.440 --> 1:18:00.440]  That's why he doesn't want to stand up and be too strong because that would actually cause
[1:18:00.440 --> 1:18:01.440]  people to worry.
[1:18:01.440 --> 1:18:02.440]  I think more.
[1:18:02.440 --> 1:18:03.440]  So he's probably going to take it easy before.
[1:18:03.440 --> 1:18:05.440]  No, I agree with you, but that's a paradox.
[1:18:05.440 --> 1:18:07.440]  We need to be alarmed, but I agree.
[1:18:07.440 --> 1:18:11.440]  The old guard in Washington that aren't complete traders, they don't want to alarm people.
[1:18:11.440 --> 1:18:12.440]  We need to be alarmed.
[1:18:12.440 --> 1:18:14.440]  Honey, thank you so much for your call.
[1:18:14.440 --> 1:18:16.440]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[1:18:16.440 --> 1:18:20.440]  Let's take a call from James in the great state of Texas, which, which Chuck E. Schumer
[1:18:20.440 --> 1:18:22.440]  says, hope we learned our lesson.
[1:18:22.440 --> 1:18:25.440]  Yeah, Chuck, we know you turned off our power plants under Obama.
[1:18:25.440 --> 1:18:28.440]  We, and you wouldn't let us turn our power plants up as we're under your control.
[1:18:28.440 --> 1:18:32.440]  Yes, we learned our lesson that you're in charge of us and pissing on us and telling
[1:18:32.440 --> 1:18:33.440]  us it's raining.
[1:18:33.440 --> 1:18:34.440]  Go ahead, James.
[1:18:34.440 --> 1:18:35.440]  What's your take on the nukes and the dims?
[1:18:35.440 --> 1:18:36.440]  What in control of them?
[1:18:36.440 --> 1:18:41.440]  Just on a quick side note, as far as that gentleman from Canada, they assaulted him for
[1:18:41.440 --> 1:18:42.440]  not wearing a mask.
[1:18:42.440 --> 1:18:46.440]  But when you steal something, they'll probably even bag your stuff up and you can walk up
[1:18:46.440 --> 1:18:47.440]  the store.
[1:18:47.440 --> 1:18:48.440]  It's really sad.
[1:18:48.440 --> 1:18:49.440]  But as far as-
[1:18:49.440 --> 1:18:52.440]  They do the same thing in a bunch of liberal cities where they let you rob the stores.
[1:18:52.440 --> 1:18:53.440]  Yeah, exactly.
[1:18:53.440 --> 1:18:55.440]  Then we just walk out and they don't do anything.
[1:18:55.440 --> 1:18:57.440]  They won't even tackle you or anything.
[1:18:57.440 --> 1:19:02.440]  But, you know, so as a side note, as far as the nuclear code is concerned, there's two
[1:19:02.440 --> 1:19:03.440]  scenarios I'm going to pay for you.
[1:19:03.440 --> 1:19:06.440]  The first one, first of all, with Democrats, nothing's a cool incident.
[1:19:06.440 --> 1:19:08.440]  Everything's scripted and everything's planned.
[1:19:08.440 --> 1:19:13.440]  So the first thing is that when they get us caught just sitting ducks, so when they have
[1:19:13.440 --> 1:19:16.440]  to go through all this red tape, there's nukes flying.
[1:19:16.440 --> 1:19:19.440]  By the time we actually get a kind of strike going, it'll be too late.
[1:19:19.440 --> 1:19:20.440]  That's one.
[1:19:20.440 --> 1:19:24.440]  Or two, the guys in the morning, they were talking about the alien, the alien invasion.
[1:19:24.440 --> 1:19:27.440]  So I'm thinking maybe they might use that as a pretext.
[1:19:27.440 --> 1:19:31.440]  So they might- I don't know, the Democrats might even- they sell all the technology to
[1:19:31.440 --> 1:19:32.440]  China.
[1:19:32.440 --> 1:19:33.440]  So who knows?
[1:19:33.440 --> 1:19:34.440]  They might even sell the nuclear codes.
[1:19:34.440 --> 1:19:36.440]  So we'll just give it to them.
[1:19:36.440 --> 1:19:38.440]  And then probably stage an alien invasion.
[1:19:38.440 --> 1:19:39.440]  Well, that's a great point.
[1:19:39.440 --> 1:19:44.440]  They've got particle beams that'll just fry buildings, blow up skyscrapers, and people
[1:19:44.440 --> 1:19:45.440]  will think it was aliens.
[1:19:45.440 --> 1:19:49.440]  And then we know there's been partially classified projects like blue beam to actually do fake
[1:19:49.440 --> 1:19:50.440]  alien invasions.
[1:19:50.440 --> 1:19:51.440]  That's a great point.
[1:19:51.440 --> 1:19:54.440]  And since we've already been sold out to China, I bet the deep-state's probably just already
[1:19:54.440 --> 1:19:56.440]  giving it all away to them.
[1:19:56.440 --> 1:19:59.440]  I'm afraid that they'll probably do it with the nuclear codes.
[1:19:59.440 --> 1:20:04.440]  They could probably just set up a nuke somewhere and just say, you know what, the aliens did
[1:20:04.440 --> 1:20:05.440]  it.
[1:20:05.440 --> 1:20:06.440]  One will go remit.
[1:20:06.440 --> 1:20:09.440]  And then, you know, they'll assure you what you want to do anyway.
[1:20:09.440 --> 1:20:10.440]  Great point.
[1:20:10.440 --> 1:20:11.440]  Thank you so much.
[1:20:11.440 --> 1:20:12.440]  All right.
[1:20:12.440 --> 1:20:13.440]  We've got Jake and Scott.
[1:20:13.440 --> 1:20:15.440]  We've been holding a long time.
[1:20:15.440 --> 1:20:17.440]  Peter is a Puerto Rico, says Nuke codes.
[1:20:17.440 --> 1:20:18.440]  Doomsday clock, fleeing the USA.
[1:20:18.440 --> 1:20:20.440]  I'm going to get to you as well.
[1:20:20.440 --> 1:20:25.440]  Carl, Kirk, Joseph, we're going to get to everybody here today.
[1:20:25.440 --> 1:20:27.440]  Tom Papert is coming up.
[1:20:27.440 --> 1:20:30.440]  Go first to Peter in Puerto Rico.
[1:20:30.440 --> 1:20:35.440]  You know, as a father, I think about fleeing the United States because we know we're a
[1:20:35.440 --> 1:20:36.440]  major target.
[1:20:36.440 --> 1:20:37.440]  But I think I'm going to go down with a ship.
[1:20:37.440 --> 1:20:40.440]  Plus, if there's a major nuclear war, it'll probably cause a dark winter.
[1:20:40.440 --> 1:20:43.440]  And most of the population of the world will die anyways, even in a limited exchange.
[1:20:43.440 --> 1:20:44.440]  What do you think?
[1:20:44.440 --> 1:20:50.440]  I mean, honestly, if people start fleeing now, even if we go to the United States or other
[1:20:50.440 --> 1:20:52.440]  places, if there's a nuclear war, it's a nuclear war.
[1:20:52.440 --> 1:20:55.440]  Like, we're 100 seconds away from the Doomsday clock.
[1:20:55.440 --> 1:20:58.440]  We were kind of set up to fail from it from the beginning.
[1:20:58.440 --> 1:21:01.440]  Like, we kind of just expected that there was going to be a nuclear war.
[1:21:01.440 --> 1:21:03.440]  We just didn't have enough people to do it.
[1:21:03.440 --> 1:21:05.440]  Now there's enough people on the planet.
[1:21:05.440 --> 1:21:06.440]  People are kind of getting vaccinated.
[1:21:06.440 --> 1:21:07.440]  That's not killing enough people.
[1:21:07.440 --> 1:21:10.440]  Might as well just accelerate it, right?
[1:21:10.440 --> 1:21:11.440]  Exactly.
[1:21:11.440 --> 1:21:17.440]  A lot of billionaires have had super deep maces, private airfields, and they all think New Zealand's
[1:21:17.440 --> 1:21:18.440]  the safe spot.
[1:21:18.440 --> 1:21:22.440]  I mean, I told you, I knew Major Hollywood director 15 years ago, said James Cameron's
[1:21:22.440 --> 1:21:24.440]  going to make a few more movies if he's done.
[1:21:24.440 --> 1:21:29.440]  He thinks New Zealand may fall, so he has a cover for his undersea company.
[1:21:29.440 --> 1:21:34.440]  That's really because he has a fleet of ships to live at sea during a nuclear war, and he's
[1:21:34.440 --> 1:21:36.440]  inviting everyone to move to New Zealand.
[1:21:36.440 --> 1:21:38.440]  I broke that 15, 16 years ago.
[1:21:38.440 --> 1:21:40.440]  That's now all confirmed.
[1:21:40.440 --> 1:21:42.440]  So that's how crazy it is, bro.
[1:21:42.440 --> 1:21:43.440]  I mean, they don't even make movies anymore.
[1:21:43.440 --> 1:21:45.440]  They've all run to New Zealand.
[1:21:45.440 --> 1:21:46.440]  Right.
[1:21:46.440 --> 1:21:48.440]  I mean, you're better off at an island, I guess.
[1:21:48.440 --> 1:21:51.440]  If I'm from here, I'm actually an indigenous person from here.
[1:21:51.440 --> 1:21:53.440]  Literally all my family's from here.
[1:21:53.440 --> 1:21:57.440]  I came over here six months after the hurricane to take care of some elderly family because
[1:21:57.440 --> 1:22:01.440]  pretty much the massive population of Puerto Rico is just all old people.
[1:22:01.440 --> 1:22:04.440]  Like, I'm coming from a dying descendancy because pretty much the majority of my people
[1:22:04.440 --> 1:22:06.440]  are just, you know, they're all old.
[1:22:06.440 --> 1:22:10.440]  But not, I haven't come around to have kids, so I'm just kind of taking care of them.
[1:22:10.440 --> 1:22:12.440]  Well, that's good to hear that.
[1:22:12.440 --> 1:22:15.440]  You've got to honor your parents.
[1:22:15.440 --> 1:22:16.440]  I'm believing this place.
[1:22:16.440 --> 1:22:21.440]  I remember the ex-governance fucking promoted Trump right before, and it just fucking went
[1:22:21.440 --> 1:22:22.440]  out the window.
[1:22:22.440 --> 1:22:23.440]  You've got to let you go.
[1:22:23.440 --> 1:22:26.440]  You can get one cuss word in, but we've got to hit a delay, and then if you do it again,
[1:22:26.440 --> 1:22:30.440]  we've got to, for the stations, we've got to hang up on you, but I appreciate your call.
[1:22:30.440 --> 1:22:31.440]  Good points.
[1:22:31.440 --> 1:22:32.440]  I appreciate your call in Puerto Rico.
[1:22:32.440 --> 1:22:35.440]  Okay, so we'll get to Carl, and we'll get to Kirk, and we'll get to Scott, and everybody
[1:22:35.440 --> 1:22:37.440]  else coming up.
[1:22:37.440 --> 1:22:42.440]  But first we're going to talk to Tom Papert on some really big issues of the communist
[1:22:42.440 --> 1:22:43.440]  Chinese infiltration.
[1:22:43.440 --> 1:22:45.440]  But America doesn't stand up for itself.
[1:22:45.440 --> 1:22:48.440]  It's become very fashionable to sell the country out.
[1:22:48.440 --> 1:22:51.440]  The big law firms and bankers all did it.
[1:22:51.440 --> 1:22:55.440]  The Chinese aren't bankers, and they're not lawyers, and the globalists aren't either.
[1:22:55.440 --> 1:22:56.440]  They want domination.
[1:22:56.440 --> 1:22:59.440]  And so all these little sycophants, I think they sold out America, and they're building
[1:22:59.440 --> 1:23:04.440]  a global government for global peace, and all this is being done for a greater detente.
[1:23:04.440 --> 1:23:07.440]  We're going to get rid of the family and get rid of men, so there's not wars in the future.
[1:23:07.440 --> 1:23:09.440]  That's all Carnegie Foundation stuff.
[1:23:09.440 --> 1:23:12.440]  That's mid-level brainwashing.
[1:23:12.440 --> 1:23:15.440]  At the top, though, it's about global domination and total control, getting everybody to give
[1:23:15.440 --> 1:23:20.440]  up their freedom, and their rights, and any checks or balances, and any deterrents show
[1:23:20.440 --> 1:23:22.440]  this world government can take over.
[1:23:22.440 --> 1:23:28.440]  And then the real extermination begins as you're all got experience just like I am.
[1:23:28.440 --> 1:23:30.440]  We've all got front-row seats to it.
[1:23:30.440 --> 1:23:34.440]  So I'm not going to just sit here in the bleachers while this all goes down.
[1:23:34.440 --> 1:23:39.440]  I'm going to be engaged and involved fighting against this.
[1:23:39.440 --> 1:23:42.440]  We'll be right back with Tom Papert, NationalFall.com.
[1:23:42.440 --> 1:23:46.440]  Broke a big Chi-Com infiltration story two days ago that took girls and picked up.
[1:23:46.440 --> 1:23:47.440]  More and more.
[1:23:47.440 --> 1:23:48.440]  National Fall is doing that.
[1:23:48.440 --> 1:23:49.440]  I'm so proud of them.
[1:23:49.440 --> 1:23:50.440]  We'll be right back.
[1:23:50.440 --> 1:23:54.440]  Stay with us.
[1:23:54.440 --> 1:24:03.440]  In the early 1990s, there was a really funny movie that came out called Wayne's World.
[1:24:03.440 --> 1:24:07.440]  Even before I had an access to these shows in the mid-1990s, I wouldn't call that movie
[1:24:07.440 --> 1:24:09.440]  and thought, man, that was fun.
[1:24:09.440 --> 1:24:13.440]  In fact, you speak out, have your own ideas, and even if you're a nerd, you're still entertaining
[1:24:13.440 --> 1:24:14.440]  because you're real.
[1:24:14.440 --> 1:24:16.440]  Well, what do they say in Wayne's World?
[1:24:16.440 --> 1:24:19.440]  We're not worthy.
[1:24:19.440 --> 1:24:20.440]  We're not worthy.
[1:24:20.440 --> 1:24:24.440]  Every day when I cover these huge topics, I don't feel worthy to talk to you because
[1:24:24.440 --> 1:24:26.440]  these topics are so huge or so real.
[1:24:26.440 --> 1:24:27.440]  But I'm trying to tell you the truth.
[1:24:27.440 --> 1:24:28.440]  I'm trying to get it right.
