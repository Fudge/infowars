[00:00.000 --> 00:25.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:25.000 --> 00:44.000]  The quickening is here. There's no doubt about that. We're live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:44.000 --> 00:50.000]  It's Sunday, December 9th, 2018. I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:50.000 --> 00:56.000]  We'll be here for the next two hours as we are every Sunday, live, 4 to 6 p.m. Central.
[00:56.000 --> 01:06.000]  And of course, there's always, especially produced hour-long counterthink with Mike Adams that comes on right after this transmission on the TV and radio satellites
[01:06.000 --> 01:16.000]  and also streamed out at infowars.com forward slash show and the folks watching at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:16.000 --> 01:23.000]  You know, people ask why I get so angry and why I work so hard, and it's the old classic statement because it's true.
[01:23.000 --> 01:28.000]  It's why anybody stands up. I love my children.
[01:28.000 --> 01:38.000]  And I know that the globalists are building a world that is very oppressive and very anti-human
[01:38.000 --> 01:47.000]  and that sees us as basically obsolete. That's just the excuse of these robber barons to want total absolute control over everyone's lives.
[01:47.000 --> 01:52.000]  They want the final revolution.
[01:52.000 --> 02:00.000]  And I was sitting back today thinking about why they target infowars and why they're so scared of it.
[02:00.000 --> 02:10.000]  And it's simple. There's a war on men. There's a war on nationalism. There's a war on resistance. And who's going to resist a big global authoritarian takeover?
[02:10.000 --> 02:17.000]  Historically. It's men that tend to organize and lead against it.
[02:17.000 --> 02:27.000]  And that's why Gavin McGinnis, right after Glenn Beck took over CRTV, I know the inside baseball, that's why he got kicked off the air.
[02:27.000 --> 02:35.000]  And that very day he got kicked off the FBI so they can't get sued, said, actually, we never said he was an extremist group, but the Proud Boys were bad.
[02:35.000 --> 02:46.000]  But it didn't matter. They'd already had leftist FBI, tell the media that, so that just saying you're an extremist, you get banned off Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, everywhere else.
[02:46.000 --> 02:48.000]  So that's how this operates. What was his crime?
[02:48.000 --> 02:55.000]  Say, we believe the nation state exists. We believe that men have a right to be men. They were inclusive to all men.
[02:55.000 --> 03:07.000]  And it's fraternal order of men, not men watching football, not men watching basketball, not men being led around by their nose, by their so-called feminist wife that really just gets orders from the government.
[03:07.000 --> 03:18.000]  But no, just men being men, that is incredibly frightening to the globalist and having nationalist movements letting people get organized and come together.
[03:18.000 --> 03:29.000]  And that is extremely frightening because if you can't let men organize and you won't let them get together, well, then you've got total checkmate over the civilization and over the population.
[03:29.000 --> 03:35.000]  And that's why there's a war on men because there's a war on the family. There's a war on the individual.
[03:35.000 --> 03:43.000]  And there is a system where now the state becomes the pimp, the pimp daddy of the women, women of the house slaves.
[03:43.000 --> 03:50.000]  I'm not saying women are the house slaves. I'm not saying women are even buying this, but this is the big goal is to divide men and women from each other.
[03:50.000 --> 03:59.000]  And if you can do that, as a species, we're done. So this is full spectrum dominance that we're facing, period.
[03:59.000 --> 04:08.000]  So we'll talk about some of that today. We're going to have Gavin McGinnis on the show here in the next few days, but make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen,
[04:08.000 --> 04:15.000]  the establishment is making their move ahead of some very, very big events.
[04:15.000 --> 04:24.000]  Now, the Democrats and the incoming head of the House Intelligence Committee have made open announcements that they have a plan to arrest President Trump.
[04:24.000 --> 04:31.000]  That's right. Now, they can't really do that in the Constitution. They don't care. There's a lot of stuff they do that isn't in the Constitution.
[04:31.000 --> 04:43.000]  And, chef, Trump may face real prospect of jail times, the quote. All this as we learned that the president has been dead on, that Comey perjured himself hundreds of times before Congress has been caught perjuring himself
[04:43.000 --> 04:48.000]  after his new closed-door testimony in the transcript that was released. He had to admit he lied.
[04:48.000 --> 05:00.000]  So much more coming up today and the fall of the New World Order starting in Europe, we predicted straight ahead as well. We have reporters on the ground in Paris.
[05:00.000 --> 05:10.000]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is. The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates, but a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater,
[05:10.000 --> 05:21.000]  and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain. Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles, and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[05:21.000 --> 05:33.000]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH. What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[05:33.000 --> 05:44.000]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter, and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[05:44.000 --> 05:55.000]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water, so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[05:55.000 --> 06:22.000]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[06:22.000 --> 06:35.000]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide its Alex Jones.
[06:35.000 --> 06:52.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Democrats have nothing to lose. They have been caught committing massive crimes in the fake Russiagate investigation, illegally spying on candidate Trump, nominee Trump, President-elect Trump, and now President Trump. Obama and Hillary gave the orders.
[06:52.000 --> 06:58.000]  We now have the documents that have been released. Comey has admitted that he lied to Congress hundreds of times.
[06:58.000 --> 07:13.000]  He said he knew nothing about the steel dossier that he had known who ordered the creation of the special counsel. Any of this stuff. And it's just a cabal of Democrats who want to overturn the election of Trump and who want to stop the American recovery from taking place.
[07:13.000 --> 07:15.000]  What an incredible time to be alive.
[07:15.000 --> 07:32.000]  Right now, upon infowars.com and newswars.com, the most banned and demonized pro-America sites in the world, Congressman Schiff taking over the Intelligence Committee in the House on January 2nd says, Trump may face, quote, real prospect of jail time.
[07:32.000 --> 07:49.000]  And ABCNBC. Hype President Trump's inevitable impeachment by the Dems. They said during the campaign they weren't going to do that because Americans wouldn't have voted for Democrats in the midterms, but oh, now they are because they're desperate to cover up their own crimes.
[07:49.000 --> 08:09.000]  Meanwhile, Trump has accurately tweeted that Comey lied to Congress. Comey told Congress, here's the big one of the 245 occasions that he lied that Trump's talking about. The big one that's ironclad is Comey saying, I've never leaked and I don't know anyone that's leaked to the media.
[08:09.000 --> 08:29.000]  And it turned out he was the chief leaker, but he went, well, I gave the information to give it to the press to a professor who would then give it to him. Oh, oh, so I'm a drug dealer and I give them the suitcase full of cocaine.
[08:29.000 --> 08:43.000]  And then my dealer goes and sells it to somebody I'm not involved in the cocaine dealing, Balderdash BS Bologna. And it goes on and on and on and to watch the corporate press try to cover it up.
[08:43.000 --> 08:58.000]  It is just mind blowing in two years in $33 million in just this fake investigation. And they have people pleading guilty for not paying taxes for taxi cab services that Trump has nothing to do with the New York.
[08:58.000 --> 09:06.000]  Michael Cohen, who did a 180 once they busted him and other crap like that. I mean, this is incredibly ridiculous.
[09:06.000 --> 09:13.000]  But they mean business. We're going to be looking at all of that coming up. We're going to be looking at the EU.
[09:13.000 --> 09:20.000]  And the fact that it's unelected, it's authoritarian, it's run by the grandson of the richest Nazi family. His father was also a Nazi.
[09:20.000 --> 09:28.000]  Yunker, a man who can't even dress himself on record, but was never elected, but just keeps running the EU decade over decade.
[09:28.000 --> 09:33.000]  They've had, as you know, three weeks of riots in Paris. We've had our own Dan Lyman and other reporters on the ground.
[09:33.000 --> 09:40.000]  They're filing incredible live video reports, temple wars.com and news wars.com last few days.
[09:40.000 --> 09:47.000]  And they are nationalists. They are patriots. They're sick of the Islamic invasion. They're sick of the welfare state.
[09:47.000 --> 09:53.000]  They're sick of the working families and farmers being killed by these massive carbon taxes. They are patriots.
[09:53.000 --> 09:57.000]  Just like they are in Brazil, electing nationalists.
[09:57.000 --> 10:06.000]  And in Spain is now electing in every election, right wingers, populist, nationalist, Germany, Merkel's parties lost power completely.
[10:06.000 --> 10:14.000]  She's still there for another year as a lame duck. I don't have to name all the places. The Brexit goes on and on.
[10:14.000 --> 10:19.000]  The point is, is that they're losing the hearts and minds.
[10:19.000 --> 10:23.000]  So they're rushing in with global censorship. They're rushing in with global control.
[10:23.000 --> 10:29.000]  They're rushing in with trying to arrest people for their speech, who they see as leaders of nationalist movements.
[10:29.000 --> 10:34.000]  But it's not going to work in the end, ladies and gentlemen, for one simple reason.
[10:34.000 --> 10:40.000]  People like being sovereign. They like their own culture. They know when they're being conquered and taken over.
[10:40.000 --> 10:51.000]  And the socialists are joining the nationalists and the right wingers, all of the world from Brazil to Italy, from the UK, do you name it?
[10:51.000 --> 11:06.000]  The blue collar union workers voting for Trump two years ago, Reagan Democrats, because they know the bringing in tens of millions of illegals to be put on welfare and be client states of the EU and the U.S.
[11:06.000 --> 11:14.000]  And other global controlled countries is meant to bankrupt the national pension system, which the globalist makes the plan.
[11:14.000 --> 11:22.000]  And so that's why in every European country where they have a vote, people understand that Soros and others have bragged he's part of the EU.
[11:22.000 --> 11:30.000]  They want to bankrupt and scuttle the EU and then out of that big global crisis, get full control and get trillions in bailouts.
[11:30.000 --> 11:38.000]  But then you lose your pension fund in the process.
[11:38.000 --> 11:52.000]  Now, that is coming up as well when Dr. Nick Baggage, of course, his father is a famous congressman, his brother, your senator, but he's best known for his best selling books on
[11:52.000 --> 12:00.000]  MK Ultra Mind Control, Weather Modification, all these different secret programs that more and more are out in the open.
[12:00.000 --> 12:06.000]  He'll be in studio with us coming up in the second hour.
[12:06.000 --> 12:10.000]  But when we come back, I've already given a little bit of a prelude to it.
[12:10.000 --> 12:21.000]  I've already given you a bit of a foreshadowing, but we are going to get specifically, specifically into their plan to remove Trump.
[12:21.000 --> 12:30.000]  And the fact that the Democrats have announced their plan, top Democrats have announced their plan to try to arrest and imprison the president.
[12:30.000 --> 12:32.000]  How sensational is that?
[12:32.000 --> 12:33.000]  And you say, but that's crazy.
[12:33.000 --> 12:35.000]  They have committed all these public crimes.
[12:35.000 --> 12:43.000]  That's precisely why they're making their move is because they know people don't listen to them anymore.
[12:43.000 --> 12:46.000]  They know they're going to lose if we have real elections in this country.
[12:46.000 --> 12:54.000]  So they want to end real elections and freedom in this nation completely and show the country up.
[12:54.000 --> 12:59.000]  Think about it.
[12:59.000 --> 13:05.000]  Everyone understands that if you want to conquer a nation, you demoralize it.
[13:05.000 --> 13:06.000]  You make it hate itself.
[13:06.000 --> 13:08.000]  You demonize its flag.
[13:08.000 --> 13:10.000]  You demonize its character.
[13:10.000 --> 13:26.000]  You divide people and then you target any men who try to organize other men and other women, other people in a defense of our common heritage and our common infrastructure and what we've paid for and built.
[13:26.000 --> 13:29.000]  Just common sense instinct to stand up yourself.
[13:29.000 --> 13:31.000]  And that's why.
[13:31.000 --> 13:35.000]  Info wars is so attacked and so lied about.
[13:35.000 --> 13:40.000]  And constantly harassed by these deep state forces.
[13:40.000 --> 13:45.000]  You see it all over the news because they know we're pointing out they're the globalists.
[13:45.000 --> 13:46.000]  They're the outsiders.
[13:46.000 --> 13:56.000]  They're the ruthless mega banks that literally pay no taxes and have diplomatic immunity and who see us in our open society is an easy plum to take down from within.
[13:56.000 --> 14:08.000]  And so I'm here raising the alarm saying this is a fraud and this is wrong and they know that the military and the police and the president and other corporate leaders who are not.
[14:08.000 --> 14:10.000]  Evil.
[14:10.000 --> 14:12.000]  Realize this is really true.
[14:12.000 --> 14:18.000]  And we're creating a dichotomy between the globalists that hate the nation and want to conquer us.
[14:18.000 --> 14:24.000]  And those of us that love what's good about America and believe in our exceptionalism and believe in a future for us together.
[14:24.000 --> 14:30.000]  And that believe that we have a right and a duty to stand up against this.
[14:30.000 --> 14:36.000]  And so that's why they hate us so much because they can't even allow us to exist.
[14:36.000 --> 14:39.000]  Because they don't want to have a debate about what they've really set up.
[14:39.000 --> 14:40.000]  Remember.
[14:40.000 --> 14:43.000]  Just four years ago.
[14:43.000 --> 14:49.000]  Every newspaper in the country had articles every few weeks saying there's no new world or the Federal Reserve isn't private.
[14:49.000 --> 14:51.000]  Nobody wants a world government.
[14:51.000 --> 14:53.000]  There's no carbon taxes.
[14:53.000 --> 14:55.000]  There's no plan to break up families.
[14:55.000 --> 14:56.000]  There's no plans.
[14:56.000 --> 14:59.000]  And then boom, there's no agenda 21.
[14:59.000 --> 15:01.000]  There's no plan to take your guns.
[15:01.000 --> 15:03.000]  And now they're all of the news saying we're going to ban the Second Amendment.
[15:03.000 --> 15:05.000]  We're going to break your families up.
[15:05.000 --> 15:09.000]  We're going to force medical procedures, tainted vaccines on your GMO.
[15:09.000 --> 15:11.000]  Yeah, we're weather modification.
[15:11.000 --> 15:12.000]  We don't care what you think.
[15:12.000 --> 15:13.000]  Yeah, that you use unelected.
[15:13.000 --> 15:16.000]  We're going to arrest anybody that criticizes what we're doing.
[15:16.000 --> 15:19.000]  Yeah, we're going to ban all conservative and Christian speech.
[15:19.000 --> 15:22.000]  Yeah, the men in the military is obsolete.
[15:22.000 --> 15:23.000]  Robots.
[15:23.000 --> 15:24.000]  Yeah, we're going to have a mark of the beast.
[15:24.000 --> 15:28.000]  Microchips for the general public.
[15:28.000 --> 15:30.000]  Yeah, we've got a world government.
[15:30.000 --> 15:31.000]  Yeah, we've got a global social score.
[15:31.000 --> 15:37.000]  Yeah, the Communist Chinese have put spy chips on all the devices and are working with deep staters to take down America.
[15:37.000 --> 15:39.000]  Everything we told you is true.
[15:39.000 --> 15:46.000]  So our credibility's gone up so high we must be removed off the air because we are winners.
[15:46.000 --> 15:47.000]  We've been proven right.
[15:47.000 --> 15:49.000]  We've been proven steadfast.
[15:49.000 --> 15:50.000]  We've been proven loyal.
[15:50.000 --> 15:52.000]  We've been proven strong.
[15:52.000 --> 15:53.000]  We've been proven vigilant.
[15:53.000 --> 15:55.000]  So we have to be memory-hold.
[15:55.000 --> 16:21.000]  They can't compete with us.
[16:21.000 --> 16:33.000]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[16:33.000 --> 16:34.000]  I want to keep going.
[16:34.000 --> 16:38.000]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[16:38.000 --> 16:40.000]  I want to push all the way.
[16:40.000 --> 16:41.000]  I've committed to do that.
[16:41.000 --> 16:42.000]  I've prayed for that.
[16:42.000 --> 16:44.000]  And I've been told that's going to happen.
[16:44.000 --> 16:47.000]  But you've got a back-ish and I promise you this.
[16:47.000 --> 16:48.000]  I will never falter.
[16:48.000 --> 16:50.000]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[16:50.000 --> 16:51.000]  I physically will.
[16:51.000 --> 16:59.000]  But I give you my commitment if you financially support us at InfoWarsFor.com to give you my absolute total commitment.

[20:44.000 --> 20:46.000]  They thought, oh, we'll defeat nationalists.
[20:46.000 --> 20:49.000]  People never organized against our world government.
[20:49.000 --> 20:54.000]  But in the last four or five years, they've gone from being arrogant to being very, very scared.
[20:54.000 --> 21:01.000]  And now they've overplayed their hand and are massively censoring and trying to arrest and indict.
[21:01.000 --> 21:11.000]  Not just presidents, not just prime ministers, not just corporate leaders, but anybody that simply stands up for justice and freedom.
[21:11.000 --> 21:15.000]  And especially anybody that stands up for the American way.
[21:15.000 --> 21:19.000]  Now let's get into it right now because here's the drumbeat.
[21:19.000 --> 21:26.000]  For two years, they've been telling President Trump, oh, you're not the target, sir. We know you're not involved in Russia, gay.
[21:26.000 --> 21:28.000]  In fact, there's nothing there.
[21:28.000 --> 21:34.000]  But they're just doing their investigation, even though it's all about some people brought in by Hillary and Obama.
[21:34.000 --> 21:40.000]  When you were president-elect, they were panicking. What were they going to do?
[21:40.000 --> 21:43.000]  They'd been in bed with Russia. They'd been in bed with China. They'd sold the nation out.
[21:43.000 --> 21:47.000]  They're the folks that say having a nation's bad, America existing.
[21:47.000 --> 21:49.000]  America was never great. It'll never be great.
[21:49.000 --> 21:51.000]  Governor Cuomo in New York.
[21:51.000 --> 21:54.000]  We're going to plunge the economy to stop Trump.
[21:54.000 --> 21:56.000]  Bill Maher, fellow reserves doing it.
[21:56.000 --> 22:00.000]  So these are the anti-American team in their own statements.
[22:00.000 --> 22:05.000]  Oh, but now Trump turned the economy around in so much two years.
[22:05.000 --> 22:08.000]  Oh, he's the agent right.
[22:08.000 --> 22:13.000]  And all of you that voted for him, you're all Russians too.
[22:13.000 --> 22:19.000]  Because the Democrats are desperate to cover up the fact that they're the people that have been selling America out.
[22:19.000 --> 22:25.000]  So now look at these headlines just today that are up on newswars.com and infowars.com.
[22:25.000 --> 22:27.000]  And then go to drudgerport.com.
[22:27.000 --> 22:32.000]  Let's go to drudgerport.com, the main front page of it.
[22:32.000 --> 22:38.000]  And just look at the crazed look of Schiff, you know, Schiff and Alexander Cortez.
[22:38.000 --> 22:43.000]  You're not just waiting for a weird moment to grab a screenshot that isn't honest.
[22:43.000 --> 22:49.000]  They always have that power-mad lunatic look in their eyes.
[22:49.000 --> 22:55.000]  I mean, this guy is incredible. He kept, he helped cover up Uranium One, all the crimes of Hillary, her foundation.
[22:55.000 --> 22:58.000]  And here he is on national television today.
[22:58.000 --> 23:03.000]  We're going to play the clip in a moment saying Trump's going to have jail time.
[23:03.000 --> 23:07.000]  Trump may face real prospect of jail time.
[23:07.000 --> 23:12.000]  And they're getting you ready because they always told the president, oh, sir, we know you didn't do anything.
[23:12.000 --> 23:15.000]  So he wouldn't move on them early on.
[23:15.000 --> 23:17.000]  They wanted to build the fraud up.
[23:17.000 --> 23:29.000]  And Trump thought he'd turn the economy on and secure the border and increase the military pay and try to get rid of the unfunded, you know, mandate of Obamacare, which he,
[23:29.000 --> 23:39.000]  and give you two good Supreme Court justices compared to what Hillary would do and thousands of new factories coming back on the best unemployment numbers in 100 years.
[23:39.000 --> 23:42.000]  Let's see.
[23:42.000 --> 23:45.000]  That was his blind spot that he was innocent.
[23:45.000 --> 23:47.000]  So he thought this is a joke.
[23:47.000 --> 23:48.000]  They don't care.
[23:48.000 --> 23:54.000]  They're going to go knowing you have hundreds of lawyers over properties like people you raided in Chicago.
[23:54.000 --> 23:55.000]  They're raiding a bunch of Trump lawyers.
[23:55.000 --> 23:59.000]  And then they'll find one of the Trump lawyers not paying taxes.
[23:59.000 --> 24:09.000]  And they tell them you go say President Trump told you to do this and that or you're going to serve decades in prison.
[24:09.000 --> 24:19.000]  And people like Michael Cohen will totally change their tune from Trump do nothing about big deal of private money being transferred an old girlfriend.
[24:19.000 --> 24:21.000]  Wasn't even campaign funds.
[24:21.000 --> 24:22.000]  The money was reimbursed.
[24:22.000 --> 24:25.000]  The Clintons have billions in illegal stuff in their foundation.
[24:25.000 --> 24:27.000]  But that's OK.
[24:27.000 --> 24:30.000]  Just oh Trump years ago.
[24:30.000 --> 24:34.000]  Money you a woman from a decade plus ago.
[24:34.000 --> 24:38.000]  And now we want to indict the president, even though it's a separation of powers.
[24:38.000 --> 24:40.000]  These grand juries won't be able to do anything.
[24:40.000 --> 24:44.000]  But the media knows the public's ignorant about the separation of powers.
[24:44.000 --> 24:50.000]  And so they're going to act like the president's going to jail.
[24:50.000 --> 24:53.000]  To build a momentum that everything he does is illegitimate.
[24:53.000 --> 24:58.000]  So they can then breathe a sigh of relief.
[24:58.000 --> 25:03.000]  And get him out of office and not go to prison for all the real crimes they've committed.
[25:03.000 --> 25:04.000]  And that's why they're so dangerous.
[25:04.000 --> 25:05.000]  Andrew McCarthy.
[25:05.000 --> 25:09.000]  Why Trump is likely to be indicted by Manhattan U.S. Attorney.
[25:09.000 --> 25:10.000]  We'll play that next segment.
[25:10.000 --> 25:11.000]  That's Fox News.
[25:11.000 --> 25:17.000]  The major takeaway from the 40 page sentencing memorandum filed by federal prosecutors Friday for Michael Cohen.
[25:17.000 --> 25:19.000]  President Trump's former personal attorney is this.
[25:19.000 --> 25:25.000]  The president is very likely to be indicted on a charge of violating federal campaign finance laws
[25:25.000 --> 25:33.000]  from a stool pigeon who's pled guilty to laundering 15 million separate from the president in a taxi cab company.
[25:33.000 --> 25:39.000]  Who's totally changed his testimony and who's been indicted for lying to the FBI and lying to Congress.
[25:39.000 --> 25:43.000]  So a known liar they claim now changes the story.
[25:43.000 --> 25:45.000]  But remember we're going to play this coming up too.
[25:45.000 --> 25:51.000]  Remember when the news like we have the tape of Trump paying off Stormy Daniels and some other woman.
[25:51.000 --> 25:55.000]  We have the tape and Cohen walks he goes hey how's it going.
[25:55.000 --> 25:57.000]  And Trump's like OK great what's going on.
[25:57.000 --> 25:58.000]  Well you know we're going to need to make a payment.
[25:58.000 --> 26:00.000]  No no no what are you talking about.
[26:00.000 --> 26:01.000]  What.
[26:01.000 --> 26:04.000]  So it's the opposite.
[26:04.000 --> 26:09.000]  It's like the Jim Acosta video where he grabs the mic from the intern and pushes her arm down.
[26:09.000 --> 26:12.000]  They go he didn't touch her fake video Alex Jones.
[26:12.000 --> 26:15.000]  Everyone saw it. We didn't do anything but zoom in.
[26:15.000 --> 26:21.000]  But this is the games the mind control they play.
[26:21.000 --> 26:25.000]  They go on to say Fox News can now tell you Trump is the target.
[26:25.000 --> 26:29.000]  Hell we told you before the investigation started they were going to do this and he was the target.
[26:29.000 --> 26:31.000]  We told you he was being illegally spied on.
[26:31.000 --> 26:32.000]  And see it goes.
[26:32.000 --> 26:36.000]  Info wars is the source of Trump being illegally spied on.
[26:36.000 --> 26:42.000]  Yeah. Because we got the DEA documents with my personal phone numbers that nobody's got.
[26:42.000 --> 26:44.000]  And Trump's and everything else.
[26:44.000 --> 26:49.000]  And then more of it came out and they bragged they were spying on him.
[26:49.000 --> 26:51.000]  Illegal and found nothing.
[26:51.000 --> 26:52.000]  That's all the real crimes.
[26:52.000 --> 26:56.000]  Nixon got kicked out of office for spying on one psychiatrist.
[26:56.000 --> 26:57.000]  They've all been doing it.
[26:57.000 --> 26:58.000]  Where's that.
[26:58.000 --> 27:00.000]  If Trump doesn't move against them now.
[27:00.000 --> 27:05.000]  Because he can't find any good men that'll take action in the Justice Department.
[27:05.000 --> 27:08.000]  It just shows what a bucket of cowards America has become.
[27:08.000 --> 27:15.000]  And even though we had a good president in there he couldn't find a dog that would hunt.
[27:15.000 --> 27:20.000]  In the whole world.
[27:20.000 --> 27:22.000]  So we're going to go to break and then I'm going to come back and play all three of the clips.
[27:22.000 --> 27:24.000]  I'm going to play Schiff.
[27:24.000 --> 27:27.000]  I'm going to play the Democrats saying they're going to start impeachment.
[27:27.000 --> 27:33.000]  And then I'm going to play Andrew C. McCarthy.
[27:33.000 --> 27:36.000]  Getting into the fact that they're going to indict the president.
[27:36.000 --> 27:37.000]  So there you go.
[27:37.000 --> 27:38.000]  And is it for Russia?
[27:38.000 --> 27:39.000]  No.
[27:39.000 --> 27:52.000]  It's for Cohen sending money to a woman the president had sex with 12, 13 years ago.
[27:52.000 --> 27:53.000]  And that's it.
[27:53.000 --> 27:54.000]  There's your Russia.
[27:54.000 --> 27:57.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, he's not in a Russian hotel getting pissed on.
[27:57.000 --> 27:59.000]  None of that's true.
[27:59.000 --> 28:00.000]  All of its lies.
[28:00.000 --> 28:04.000]  But by the way, Comey admitted and testimony to Congress this week was closed door.
[28:04.000 --> 28:06.000]  They released a transcript.
[28:06.000 --> 28:07.000]  He says he's such a liar.
[28:07.000 --> 28:09.000]  They demanded to be a transfer police.
[28:09.000 --> 28:10.000]  Republicans did.
[28:10.000 --> 28:13.000]  And he admits, oh no, we know the still dossier is fake.
[28:13.000 --> 28:21.000]  And of course, remember coming live to Congress and said that he never anything about the dossier or steal or spy on the president.
[28:21.000 --> 28:23.000]  And he never knew anybody that leaked.
[28:23.000 --> 28:26.000]  Well, he was asked if you talked to the media about this.
[28:26.000 --> 28:28.000]  Oh, no, I've never talked to the media.
[28:28.000 --> 28:30.000]  I've never done nothing.
[28:30.000 --> 28:32.000]  I know nothing.
[28:32.000 --> 28:33.000]  No.
[28:33.000 --> 28:34.000]  No.
[28:34.000 --> 28:35.000]  Remember Hogan's heroes.
[28:35.000 --> 28:36.000]  If you're old enough to remember that.
[28:36.000 --> 28:38.000]  I know nothing.
[28:38.000 --> 28:39.000]  Nothing.
[28:39.000 --> 28:41.000]  No.
[28:41.000 --> 28:44.000]  All these criminals caught with their ass hanging out.
[28:44.000 --> 28:49.000]  And now they want to get rid of this great president because he used his own money.
[28:49.000 --> 28:54.000]  They claim well through the campaigns they would know is to give a woman $107,000.
[28:54.000 --> 28:55.000]  Yeah.
[28:55.000 --> 28:56.000]  Where's the Russia gate?
[28:56.000 --> 29:00.000]  Only in Hillary and Obama's play.

[31:59.000 --> 32:17.000]  Info wars life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine introducing pollen block. We have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[32:17.000 --> 32:37.000]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses. They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[32:37.000 --> 32:51.000]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[32:51.000 --> 33:11.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to info wars life dot com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[33:11.000 --> 33:33.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting in worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:33.000 --> 33:44.000]  Well, if you want the news two years in advance, you want news wars dot com. You want info wars dot com. You want the Alex Jones show. You want this team.
[33:44.000 --> 33:58.000]  Because we told you they're running a legal spying operation on Trump. We told you specifically how you don't just think little birdie tweeties told us to you.
[33:58.000 --> 34:03.000]  It's not that I'm even that good. It's that most people aren't crazy enough to go up against the globalist.
[34:03.000 --> 34:10.000]  Somebody's got to do it. My God can't hand the whole world over a bunch of damn child molesters. But sorry.
[34:10.000 --> 34:20.000]  I can't believe the fact that Trump can't get enough people to move against these come. But let me just stop right there.
[34:20.000 --> 34:31.000]  The entire Democratic Party is about destroying America and selling us out. They're globalist Republicans have been a bunch of cowardly blue bloods scared of the corporate media and scared of the left.
[34:31.000 --> 34:42.000]  Now Trump and the Nationalist Tea Party Liberty movement has gained a major foothold in Congress and the presidency and most the states.
[34:42.000 --> 34:55.000]  Now the Democrats are resorting to election fraud. They're resorting to inditing their political enemies. Like 10 members of the House got indicted by Democrats and ended up losing their seats to up in California.
[34:55.000 --> 35:01.000]  They've taken the damn gloves off. And it's not like we're looking for a fight here. But it's kind of like what you get one you're not scared anymore.
[35:01.000 --> 35:10.000]  It's like well that guy just knocked me upside the head. I'm in a real fight. And you know what suddenly things start going your way when you finally realize you're in a fight.
[35:10.000 --> 35:22.000]  Instead of always pretending you're not. We're in a fight. I'm getting my guts kicked out here. But you know what I'm kicking and I'm biting and I'm punching back baby.
[35:22.000 --> 35:35.000]  And I can tell you right now our enemy ain't doing too well. All over the world. So let's stop being wimps. You know most of the men I know aren't like Trump.
[35:35.000 --> 35:44.000]  People say the worse it gets for Trump the worse it gets for you. Why do you get more pro Trump because he's real ladies and gentlemen and I watch everybody else kind of move away.
[35:44.000 --> 35:56.000]  Because they want to sit there and secure their future. We're going to lose our whole future. Letting these anti free market anti God globalist in control.
[35:56.000 --> 36:08.000]  Period. And if people don't have the instinct or the understanding of that at a spiritual level you have no discernment and I just I see the grand illusion of it.
[36:08.000 --> 36:17.000]  The whole new world order is now admitted world government human cloning for decades animal human clones plan to break up the family.
[36:17.000 --> 36:27.000]  They're putting toxins and nanotech carriers in the vaccines confirmed GMO is designed to sterilize his cancer rates off the chart infertility off the chart.
[36:27.000 --> 36:31.000]  We're under attack.
[36:31.000 --> 36:42.000]  And Trump is trying to batter Ram into that deep state into that secret shadow government system to get in there and stop it.
[36:42.000 --> 36:51.000]  And that's why they're so damn scared because you've had a business and you go away for a month or two and you come back and your employees think that they're your boss.
[36:51.000 --> 37:03.000]  Not really happened to me but it's how people I know how about this your parents go away. You're 17. This kind of happened on a year long excuse me a month long trip to Europe.
[37:03.000 --> 37:11.000]  They deserve it. You know it's their whatever anniversary they come back and you kind of kicked up doing everything you want almost like you own the place until they set you straight.
[37:11.000 --> 37:19.000]  That's what's happened here or use the Ulysses and the Iliad.
[37:19.000 --> 37:23.000]  He's gone ever many decades and he comes back people taking over his house.
[37:23.000 --> 37:40.000]  It's the same archetype and now it's been done and the people that have done it are counting on the cowardice of the lawyers and the politicians and federal law enforcement and everyone to keep scratching each other's back to keep being cowards to keep going along with the same old crap over
[37:40.000 --> 37:58.000]  and over again while every institution we've got from the colleges to the public schools to the Catholic Church to Protestant churches to the UN to everything it's caught in massive child molestation rings.
[37:58.000 --> 38:10.000]  It's caught in just all sorts of incredible out of control corruption and you're like why is this happening because we've allowed the worst of the worst to get into gangs and sees control of our culture in our world.
[38:10.000 --> 38:20.000]  And now they're raining down hell on everyone and they're trying to finish the job and demoralize us and break our spirit.
[38:20.000 --> 38:30.000]  And it doesn't make me want to have my spirit broken when they do this. It makes me get angry that I don't have enough energy or enough will to tell.
[38:30.000 --> 38:37.000]  And I said I'd play all these clips this segment. I got at least five of them next. I'm going to be judicious. I'm going to get to them all next segment.
[38:37.000 --> 38:52.000]  But I mean we're here. And the president's own cowardly lawyers all of them told him sir we've talked to Mueller we've talked to Comey we've talked to McCabe you're not the focus you're not that no no sir that's a lie you weren't being spied on no sir.
[38:52.000 --> 38:59.000]  No sir. Well how does Alex Jones have all my private phone numbers. Well I just don't worry about it Mr. President.
[38:59.000 --> 39:12.000]  And that that's the level this goes to. Jones here's all the numbers. They're spying on Trump and all the documents. I mean we get all this ladies and gentlemen.
[39:12.000 --> 39:30.000]  You understand that. And I sit here every day mad at myself with the weight of this with the weight of a anti human truly evil spiritually vampiric world government that is announcing Mark of the Beast microchips to buy and sell
[39:30.000 --> 39:43.000]  multiple social scores where if you don't toe the line to teach your five year old boy that they're a little girl or vice versa and don't let the school sign your son up to have his testicles chopped off you get put in a digital
[39:43.000 --> 40:01.000]  and starved to death. That's their plan. They are already coming for us. The New World Order is it coming. It's here. Now I want to explain something. You're the target. I don't care if you're black. I don't care if you're white. I don't care if you're old. I don't care if you're young. I don't care if you're gay. I don't care if you're straight.
[40:01.000 --> 40:21.000]  I don't care if you're whatever you are. This New World Order wants your ass dead. It's taken over the planet. It thinks you're eating its food. It wants you gone. And it's introducing systems to absolutely totally and completely control every facet of what you do.
[40:21.000 --> 40:35.000]  And to make you as cowardly and as stupid and as controllable as possible. You know I see the crew pulling up articles when I talk about something they search engine and pull it up. You don't need to pull up info wars dot com.
[40:35.000 --> 40:53.000]  It's on Fox CNN, MSNBC, human animal clones, human baby clones, edited human genes that aren't really humans in China, cows that grow humanoids inside their uteruses. All of it is in MIT quarterly. It's all public.
[40:53.000 --> 41:10.000]  It's all planned in the family as we know it. Germany 10 years ago banned by 2020 single family homes. They've now it's this year.
[41:10.000 --> 41:29.000]  They're banned. They're banning families living in homes together. Now San Francisco is doing it. They're banning fireplaces. They don't want any primitive human activity because they want you totally domesticated. They are scientifically overriding you.
[41:29.000 --> 41:47.000]  The globalists say we don't believe in aliens. We don't believe in God yet. We're going to make aliens here on earth. We're going to merge the machines. We're going to be the new advanced species and we're going to wipe everyone out as just a psychotic will to power to conquer and control and dominate everything on this earth.
[41:47.000 --> 42:01.000]  That's been the plan by megalomaniacs for thousands of years, but now they've got the technology to try it and they'll fail. But will they kill all of us in the process of failing? That's the big question.
[42:01.000 --> 42:17.000]  And that's why anybody that sells out to this and anybody that thinks you're going to get away with working with the system and not be destroyed in the end, you're a fool. This thing is stinks. This thing has evil and genocide and Satan written all over it.
[42:17.000 --> 42:26.000]  Only a person completely cut off from God wouldn't see how devilish and bad this is.
[42:26.000 --> 42:32.000]  So I sit here every day before I go on here and I think, man, this is such this is so serious. Why don't people understand?
[42:32.000 --> 42:41.000]  I know they listen. Billions of people have tuned in over the years, but it's not enough. People have to get out of all the different flavors of media and this info out there.
[42:41.000 --> 42:49.000]  This is the truth. We know what we're talking about. We really study what the globalists are doing and we have only told you the truth.
[42:49.000 --> 42:59.000]  I'm not worried about me. I'm worried about everybody. I God, I don't give a hell about myself. I care about all of us together.
[42:59.000 --> 43:05.000]  In the last few months, in full wars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best selling items.
[43:05.000 --> 43:12.000]  And then I came up with the idea last week, let's not just extend the sale of free shipping store wide 50 to 75% off double patriot points.
[43:12.000 --> 43:22.000]  Let's extend that sale, but also add a free gift with every order. Even if it's a tube of fluoride free, colloidal silver, iodine four to five super blue,
[43:22.000 --> 43:27.000]  you'll get a free gift of a best selling t-shirt while supplies last.
[43:27.000 --> 43:31.000]  And what I mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling out.
[43:31.000 --> 43:36.000]  So whatever you order that day, they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out.
[43:36.000 --> 43:43.000]  Then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders. So in the next 12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had.
[43:43.000 --> 43:50.000]  So this is a loss leader. We are losing money on this. This is our biggest sale ever. Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything.
[43:50.000 --> 43:56.000]  And don't fight the crowds in four store dot com in four's life dot com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.

[46:58.000 --> 47:11.000]  Again, you are the resistance.
[47:11.000 --> 47:38.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us. I want to get into the open announcement with all the talking points by the Democrats and establishment operatives that President Trump will be criminally indicted,
[47:38.000 --> 47:48.000]  not for Russia, but for violating campaign finance law, giving money to women he dated more than a decade ago, which Cohen has been caught lying about that.
[47:48.000 --> 47:55.000]  So that's all the fraud as well. But notice no Russia as usual. This is their plan to derail the country. This is all they can dig up on the president.
[47:55.000 --> 48:15.000]  This is just simply amazing. And he's got total crimes by the Clintons, total crimes by Comey Mueller, all the Obama, the illegal spying, the sellouts to China, Russia, but he can't get any of that swamp of lawyers and cowards at the Justice Department to do anything.
[48:15.000 --> 48:26.000]  Because they're all just such incredible of feet pieces of trash. And that's a society collapses. There's no more men. It's why there's a war on m4.
[48:26.000 --> 48:35.000]  It's why there's a war on Gavin McGinnis to ban him because you can't have anybody that tells men to act like men and stop rolling over and being a bunch of jackasses.
[48:35.000 --> 48:50.000]  And coming up, blue armored vehicles, EU troops, foreign troops, not since the Nazis were kicked out in 1945, as France had foreign troops rolling in.
[48:50.000 --> 49:01.000]  But remember, Macron got sworn in almost two years ago to the EU anthem. Oh, the joy not to the French anthem. I think sounds even better.
[49:01.000 --> 49:07.000]  That's how treason flies its flags openly in your face.
[49:07.000 --> 49:19.000]  That's coming up. We're going to play the audio to it and all of it. It is truly disgusting. Imagine Trump gets sworn in and we play some, you know, world government him.
[49:19.000 --> 49:33.000]  That's how they rub. Here's the good news. War in Paris, riots, rock city, three weeks in tear gas, fury, looters, raid shops, Russia on presidential palace, pressure builds on Macron,
[49:33.000 --> 49:46.000]  alarming Europe, classes in Belgium, Netherlands, America next. That's on dredgerport.com and newswars.com. And our own reporter Dan Lyman filed incredible reports, headlines on infowars.com.
[49:46.000 --> 49:53.000]  Footage from the Yellow Vest in Paris, shot by M4's reporter.
[49:53.000 --> 50:04.000]  It's on infowars.com right now. Again, it's your support of us that allows us to send people in to do this, like Dan Lyman and his team, and doing an incredible job.
[50:04.000 --> 50:17.000]  And that's why it's so important you pray for infowars. Why it's so critical you thank the local TV stations and radio stations that pick us up and spread the word and why you go to infowars.com and do your Christmas shopping there.
[50:17.000 --> 50:29.000]  T-shirts and books and films and air filters and water filters, all the best systems and great supplements. Shop with us and you've got my commitment. I'll fight till we beat the globalist or go down swinging.
[50:29.000 --> 50:41.000]  All right, let's go to this first clip. This is McCarthy, he was assistant U.S. attorney. It's Fox News story. Why Trump is likely to be indicted by a Manhattan U.S. attorney?
[50:41.000 --> 50:45.000]  That's been the plan all along. Here it is.
[50:45.000 --> 51:04.000]  There's a lot of people don't like the campaign finance laws, but they are the law and the southern district really champions them in a big way. I think that's important because it's clear that they have implicated the president in the two campaign finance violations that Cohen pled guilty to and will be sentenced on.
[51:04.000 --> 51:18.000]  They have the president basically directing Cohen to commit these offenses. So these are two felonies that this guy pled guilty to and they have the president directing it.
[51:18.000 --> 51:38.000]  They have the president directing it. Did you guys queue up the audio? I forgot to ask you in the break. Did you guys queue up the famous Trump cointate? Where? Yeah, well, we're going to play that after the next clip, but the point is remember they hyped this all up.
[51:38.000 --> 51:48.000]  Dun dun dun, we've got Cohen Trump admitting he paid off somebody and then he's in there saying, yeah, we got to make the payment. Trump goes, no, what are you talking about?
[51:48.000 --> 52:05.000]  But again, we're Russia. Women 10, 15 years ago, Trump giving him money. Cohen says Trump never told him to do it through the campaign. Now he says he did. This is a known liar trying to cover his ass, but it doesn't matter.
[52:05.000 --> 52:19.000]  Trump's his own branch of government. The Democrats are selling this country out hand over fist illegally smuggling children in even the Washington Post admits open borders, selling us out to China, letting China put spy chips in our defense hardware,
[52:19.000 --> 52:34.000]  giving them the Office of Personnel Management hack, Hillary's billions in illegal foundation paper play, her illegal server, all of it, and then a bunch of angry Democrats running this persecution of Trump and all they've got is a lying stool pigeon.
[52:34.000 --> 52:48.000]  Saying Trump told him use campaign money to pay off a woman when only a crazy ass person would do that and there's no proof. Good lord. If America buys this, then we deserve what happened to us.
[52:48.000 --> 52:54.000]  Let's go to chef. Old Angel eyes.
[52:54.000 --> 53:02.000]  I mean, if anybody's got pervert eyes in the world, it's him. Those little whatever you call him. He mentioned all he's always.
[53:02.000 --> 53:05.000]  Hi, I'm Congressman chef.
[53:05.000 --> 53:08.000]  Here he is today.
[53:08.000 --> 53:14.000]  Democrat California head of the intelligence committee now on Sunday said President Donald Trump.
[53:14.000 --> 53:27.000]  It face real prospect of y'all time. Here it is. The filing made Friday by federal prosecutors in Manhattan references individual one about 30 times individual one is President Trump.
[53:27.000 --> 53:36.000]  And it appears to link him to campaign finance violations. It doesn't charge him with any wrongdoing though. What's your takeaway.
[53:36.000 --> 53:48.000]  My takeaway is there's a very real prospect that on the day Donald Trump leaves office, the Justice Department may indict him that he may be the first president in quite some time to face the real prospect of jail time.
[53:48.000 --> 53:54.000]  We have been discussing the issue of pardons that the president may offer to people or Daniel in front of people.
[53:54.000 --> 54:01.000]  The bigger pardon question may come down the road as the next president has to determine whether department Donald Trump.
[54:01.000 --> 54:06.000]  Now, I think the prosecutors in New York make a powerful case against that idea.
[54:06.000 --> 54:17.000]  All the arguments they make about Michael Cohen, the idea that while people are out walking precincts and doing what they should do in campaigns, the rich and powerful seem to live by a different set of rules.
[54:17.000 --> 54:21.000]  So this was the argument for putting Michael Cohen in jail on these campaign violations.
[54:21.000 --> 54:26.000]  That argument, I think, was equally made with respect to individual one, the President of the United States.
[54:26.000 --> 54:34.000]  The President's attorney Rudy Giuliani says though that this can't be a campaign finance violation because of the precedent set.
[54:34.000 --> 54:43.000]  He cites specifically what happened with former Vice Presidential candidate and Democrat John Edwards who used campaign funding to cover up an affair.
[54:43.000 --> 54:46.000]  What do you make of that defense and interpretation?
[54:46.000 --> 54:56.000]  Well, it's clear the Justice Department here is making the argument that the principal purpose of these payments was to affect the election and Cohen has admitted as much.
[54:56.000 --> 54:59.000]  I think in the case with Edwards there were problems of proof.
[54:59.000 --> 55:07.000]  Here it appears the Justice Department doesn't think there's any problem of proving that this was intended to principally affect the election.
[55:07.000 --> 55:23.000]  And to have the Justice Department basically say that the President of the United States not only coordinated but directed an illegal campaign scheme that may have had an election altering impact is pretty.
[55:23.000 --> 55:26.000]  So, again, he just changes the subject.
[55:26.000 --> 55:27.000]  There's no Russia gate.
[55:27.000 --> 55:28.000]  There's no nothing.
[55:28.000 --> 55:30.000]  These people are literally selling the country out.
[55:30.000 --> 55:35.000]  The Democrat policy, their platform is we believe America doesn't exist.
[55:35.000 --> 55:36.000]  We hate America.
[55:36.000 --> 55:37.000]  It's never great.
[55:37.000 --> 55:38.000]  We have open borders.
[55:38.000 --> 55:40.000]  We're going to sell all our jobs out to China.
[55:40.000 --> 55:41.000]  We're in bed with the UN.
[55:41.000 --> 55:43.000]  Hillary gets billions of their foundation paper play.
[55:43.000 --> 55:46.000]  And now here's your Russia gate.
[55:46.000 --> 55:53.000]  Cohen says they they use Trump's money through the campaign to pay a woman.
[55:53.000 --> 55:55.000]  Let's let's play this other clip.
[55:55.000 --> 56:03.000]  Here's ABC NBC hype the inevitable impeachment because he's actually a real president.
[56:03.000 --> 56:10.000]  Are we going to hear more of this in January now from leading Democrats that maybe there are impeachable offenses here?
[56:10.000 --> 56:11.000]  I think it's inevitable.
[56:11.000 --> 56:23.000]  And in fact, I think there's going to be a point where House Democrats are going to feel as if if they don't open an impeachment inquiry over what they've seen so far, then what would be the trigger?
[56:23.000 --> 56:33.000]  A future Congress in 25 years may may be upset that this Congress that this next Congress didn't do it.
[56:33.000 --> 56:46.000]  You know, there is so much alleged law breaking that has taken place that if Congress at all wants to be a watchdog for the executive branch, I think it's inevitable.
[56:46.000 --> 56:49.000]  So look, I think it's inevitable that an impeachment inquiry is going to get open.
[56:49.000 --> 56:53.000]  And as Jerry Nadler says, it doesn't mean they will end up impeaching him.
[56:53.000 --> 56:57.000]  But I think the investigation is going to open sooner rather than later.
[56:57.000 --> 57:01.000]  They say on other channels.
[57:01.000 --> 57:05.000]  If you look at Chuck Todd and all these people, they work for Obama.
[57:05.000 --> 57:06.000]  They work for Hillary.
[57:06.000 --> 57:12.000]  It's all these people are Democratic Party hacks, the literal party of we hate America.
[57:12.000 --> 57:13.000]  We hate your guns.
[57:13.000 --> 57:14.000]  We hate Christians.
[57:14.000 --> 57:15.000]  We hate veterans.
[57:15.000 --> 57:16.000]  We hate prosperity.
[57:16.000 --> 57:17.000]  We hate everything.
[57:17.000 --> 57:19.000]  Here are these dirt bags all up there.
[57:19.000 --> 57:20.000]  They never tell you.
[57:20.000 --> 57:24.000]  Oh, by the way, I'm a Democratic Party operative covering my own ass.
[57:24.000 --> 57:28.000]  Because if it ever comes out, we've done in this country, it's over for all of us.

[59:46.000 --> 01:00:10.000]  Again, you are the resistance.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:17.000]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report. It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:25.000]  Well, a lot of incredible things are happening. I can officially tell you the New World Order corporate world government program is falling.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:29.000]  Humanity has awakened to the fact that our nations are run by these multinational corporations.
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:33.000]  They have a very sinister agenda of depopulation and planetary control in place.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:40.000]  They'll be breaking it all down the other side with Dr. Nick Baggage in studio. But first, a critical report, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:46.000]  Dealing with the Clinton body count because Trump's getting ready to declassify a lot of documents on this.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:01:06.000]  The popular term Clinton body count has been described as a list of Clinton associates who met their untimely death, some by orders from the Clintons themselves.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:16.000]  Google has altered its search algorithm to prevent searches for Clinton body count from auto completing.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:27.000]  Just recently, the Twitter account at Robbie12692 released a thread called the Clinton body count.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:32.000]  The following are just some of the names on that list.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:39.000]  We see the popularity of the Clinton brand being shunned by most Americans.
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:46.000]  Is this the final curtain call for the Clintons and their criminal cabal?
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:51.000]  The first major Clinton scandal was in the late 80s.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:02:08.000]  While Bill Clinton was governor of Arkansas, there were allegations of a CIA run operation out of Mina Regional Airport, where guns were allegedly being exported to Nicaraguan Contras, and cocaine was being imported to fund the operation.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:20.000]  Strangely enough, several key witnesses involved in this investigation were murdered before giving their testimony, and several investigators were also murdered.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:26.000]  Next came the Whitewater scandal.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:34.000]  And oddly enough, several more witnesses and investigators mysteriously died.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.000]  Most were declared to be suicides.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:47.000]  Vincent Foster was shot in the mouth and in the back of the neck with two different calibers, and it was ruled a suicide.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:58.000]  And did you know that during the Monica Lewinsky scandal, two of Bill Clinton's female interns were murdered? Coincidence, maybe.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:09.000]  Throughout the years, several journalists investigating the Clintons were killed, committed suicide, or mysteriously died.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:23.000]  And after President Trump called for an investigation into the Clinton Foundation, strangely enough, several close associates, whistleblowers, and investigators also killed themselves.
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:27.000]  The Paladino's house exploded.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:33.000]  And Lara Perjodeco fell 27 stories down a trash chute.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.000]  Is it all coincidence?
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:41.000]  Are the Clintons cursed? Or are they criminals?
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:48.000]  After two years of investigation, nothing criminal has been discovered about President Donald Trump.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:55.000]  What about the Clintons and their associates?
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  Quite arguably, the majority of Americans elected President Trump to investigate the Clinton and other suspected deep state criminals.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:10.000]  The crowds of Americans chanting, lock her up, are not racist Nazis.
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:16.000]  No, they are simply tired of a lifetime of voting for the lesser of two evils.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:24.000]  Many believe that if the Trump presidency reaches its end without bringing justice to the deep state, then it would be a total failure.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.000]  Nothing will have changed.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:33.000]  So let us come together as Americans and seek justice for our children.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:36.000]  For only the truth shall set us free.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:41.000]  President Trump asks, can Americans handle what I am about to release?
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.000]  We can, and we must.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:54.000]  This is Greg Rees for NewsWars.com.

[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:37.000]  Well, one of the longest guests I've had on over the years for the longest period of time has been a guest.
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:41.000]  One of my favorite people, Dr. Nick Begas is in the studio with us. He's here in Austin for a few days.
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:46.000]  He's going to be sitting there with me tomorrow and throughout the week, a guest co-hosting with us some.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:58.000]  He's really the guy that got people to look at the shadow government, to look at the technocracy, which the EU now calls themselves, Davos now calls themselves,
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:02.000]  and to study kind of the mad scientists and what they're building.
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:10.000]  For the next three segments after this one, I want to focus on that and really who runs it, what their in-game is.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:17.000]  But just right now, the state of the world, again, earthpulse.com is your great website, and I'm going to get into the whole background.
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:22.000]  Your dad's a famous congressman, whistleblower, your brother, U.S. Senator. We've also got all your best-selling books.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:31.000]  We sell your DVDs, then forestore.com, but you are obviously a scientist and researcher and world-renowned for exposing harp and so many other things.
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:36.000]  And now MK Ulter's been more declassified this week. We've got the guy that got declassified on tomorrow.
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:46.000]  We're going to look at the in-game next segment, but the time we have in this short segment, big, giant, blue armored vehicles with foreign troops in Paris suppressing their own population.
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:57.000]  Global carbon taxes, open announcements of human animal chimeric loans, open announcements of Google and other big tech companies working with China to suppress their people.
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:06.000]  And now here, all of this world government, all of it, it's this weird paradox now where it's not that we're passe, we've been proven right.
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:10.000]  And so now that we've been proven right, we've got to be suppressed.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:16.000]  There was a certain, I think, arrogance the last few decades by the establishment of the technocrats, you know, no one's listening.
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:23.000]  But now that they do know that they're in trouble and nationalism and populism and a pro-human future movement's growing,
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:27.000]  that there is a move now to kind of accelerate and block us.
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:32.000]  So what would you, A, you agree, B, you disagree, but what would you call this period of time we're in right now?
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:39.000]  They're totally accurate. I mean, in terms of your assessment of the current situation and as I see it and how it's developed over the years,
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:46.000]  it is the technical aspects of our society. And if you think about governments, what makes governments powerful in the 21st century?
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.000]  It is technology. That is the essence of it.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:54.000]  And so within a democratic republic, and this has been sort of my mission the last 25 years that we've been working together,
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:09:00.000]  is to educate people on the technologies that shape what our republic is going to look like now and in the future.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:05.000]  And so 25 years of warning, and now what we see is a matrix, really, in terms of-
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000]  Well, that's exactly what you warned of.
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:13.000]  We're not like, oh great, we were right. It's like, oh my God, we'll be right about the next phase. We're really screwed.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:18.000]  Well, I'm kind of a little bit of a contrarian in terms of how this is going.
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000]  No, no, I agree. I think things are about to boomerang.
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.000]  I think so too. And people really react to trauma, okay?
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:28.000]  And we are in a traumatic phase in our history, and I think everybody would agree.
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000]  And it's not just in the US, but I travel a lot around the world.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:39.000]  I see exactly the same overlays by the same corporate banking elite community, but they change it just a little bit.
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:43.000]  So the Europeans get their little dose. Latin Americans get a different dose.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:48.000]  And Americans and Canadians, we get a different dose. And it's culturally corrected.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:53.000]  So it fits in and kind of comes in under the door. And that's exactly the way it's happened.
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.000]  Little bit at a time.
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000]  And you can see it's globally coordinated.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.000]  Absolutely coordinated. And that's where really jumps out when you travel.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:04.000]  Because you hear the same buzzwords, the same key phrases, the same push.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:09.000]  And then you see where the delays are, like in Latin America, the delay on the current generation.
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:13.000]  There's still courtesy. There's still people talking to each other. There's still kindness.
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:18.000]  As a general way of being when I'm in far Latin America, Ecuador, Peru, these areas.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:21.000]  When you look at what's changed.
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.000]  No, you're right. They're removing the humanity from our children.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.000]  And even if we know what's going on, we can't even save them.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000]  No, I mean, we're fighting with it all the time.
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:34.000]  I mean, we deal with our children. And I mean, I have still an 11 year at home.
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:40.000]  And just trying to overcome the school district programming with my own family programming,
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:44.000]  if you will, you know, my value system and how I see the world.
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000]  And it's becoming increasingly more difficult.
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:51.000]  Media used to be about informing. I mean, when you think about what this program is about,
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:56.000]  what info is it about, it's about informing the public so we can make decisions within a Democratic Republic
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000]  that lead to a better way.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:04.000]  What we see in government and what we see in education now is a way of complying, fitting in,
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000]  not raising your head, don't stand up, don't speak out.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:12.000]  These are the things that political speech has begun to frame with our children.
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:16.000]  It's classic 1984. I mean, they're going with like an instruction manual.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:24.000]  Right. And it's just changed the words, changed the phrases and basically, you know, make BS into fertilizer.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:30.000]  You know, and this is really it. And as I look at sort of the shaping of what's going on in Europe right now,
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:36.000]  the backlash and the French are notorious, of course, for, you know, the beginnings of democracy,
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:41.000]  if you really will, going back, you know, back to when it was all about eating cake,
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:44.000]  and they dumped the king and created a republic.
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.000]  You know, the same is possible again. And I think that's what we're seeing.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.000]  If you think about Spongebob.
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:51.000]  I was about to say, you think the French are totally broke back and serving the globalists,
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:55.000]  but that's where they push the hardest and that's where the explosion happens,
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000]  right where the globalists didn't think it would.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:03.000]  Right. And this is where you put this much pressure on people and you try and suppress people in this way.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:08.000]  Eventually it breaks out and that is what we're beginning to see. People are fed up, tired of it.
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000]  And you've been continually predicting that.
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:16.000]  Absolutely. And I think the other side of it is, as people come through the trauma of it,
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:22.000]  they will reclaim the power of who we are as human beings and begin to express ourselves as we were intended,
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.000]  as we were created to be, to shape the world, to frame the world,
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:29.000]  not to be pushed along, molded and herded through the earth.
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:37.000]  We're here as sovereign, individual, co-custodians of a planet with an objective to change the world,
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:43.000]  to push back on the elites, to push back on globalism and recognize nationalism,
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:47.000]  not just as a theme for the United States, but a theme that's being echoed around the world,
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:53.000]  because nationalism is about local, regional values, being expressed within our cultures.
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.000]  It's about humanity.
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.000]  And it is about humanity, the diversity of who we are.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.000]  And notice the control corporate left, because I would call you classical liberal,
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.000]  like I am the so-called leftist though would say, oh, get rid of that.
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.000]  No, real diversity is the different communities.
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:11.000]  Absolutely. And the fact of the matter is, when I go to another country, I conform with those social norms,
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.000]  because I'm their guest. I mean, that's how I view it.
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:18.000]  And I travel a lot. And I mean, you know, when you go to certain parts of the world,
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:21.000]  there are certain things you don't do, there are certain things that you do,
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.000]  and it's a matter of respect.
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:26.000]  I mean, in France, a woman can walk off the Son of Beach and no one will blink.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.000]  Try that in Saudi Arabia and see what happens to you. Right?
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:34.000]  I mean, but these are value systems that cultures accept in one place and another.
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.000]  But how we react to each other.
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000]  I don't say we have to accept what everybody does.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:44.000]  Sure. There's a big corporate program that doesn't want women to be women, men to be men,
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:49.000]  that is threatened by normal human biological instinct and drive.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.000]  It's trying to cut us off from our source.
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:56.000]  Yeah, that's very true. In fact, if you go back to sort of the biological side of that,
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.000]  for just a minute, to switch over to the science side,
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.000]  there are full sesergens all through our environment now.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:07.000]  And there's about a thousand of these that are compounds created and introduced to our environment annually.
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.000]  And these create a feminizing of species.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000]  And you see it in the northern regions.
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:17.000]  The reason you see it in the northern regions and the southern regions where the food chain is the shortest.
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:21.000]  You know, you go from what's coming out of the air into your lichens
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:25.000]  eaten by in our part of the world in the north, reindeer and caribou,
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000]  and then quickly adopted into human diets.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:31.000]  And so you see in the northern countries higher rates of sterilization,
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:35.000]  feminization of boys in terms of physiologically changing
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000]  because we have more estrogen in us.
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000]  I was reading studies like European genitals,
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.000]  especially in the north, are about a third the size they were 50 years ago.
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:45.000]  And the sperm counts are gone. I mean, this is where this has happened.
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000]  This is happening now.
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:51.000]  And this came out of a work that was culminated in a book called Our Stolen Future.
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:54.000]  And it was written by a group of MIT scientists and others
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000]  looking at this a number of years ago.
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000]  And we lectured together actually in the European part.
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:59.000]  Let's talk about that.
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:03.000]  So instead of looking at you and top scientists, our stolen future and all the admissions,
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:08.000]  just have me say they're making the frogs gay as a side note and make it all a big joke.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:12.000]  Even though it's all the total Holocaust of our species,
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:16.000]  giving women breast cancer, sterilizing men, but it's all funny.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000]  This is real. And this is actually happening.
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:24.000]  And when I talk about it being addressed, it was addressed almost 15 years ago in Europe as an issue.
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:29.000]  And here we are all these years later periodically reading the news reports about amphibians,
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:33.000]  which is where it shows up in the, as you mentioned, frogs and it does.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:36.000]  But also mutations, creating genetic mutation as well.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:39.000]  And you see that in the amphibian species first.
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:42.000]  Because again, they're close to the bottom of the food chain and they're working their way up.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000]  But remember, other creatures eat those.
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.000]  We eat those creatures.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.000]  And eventually it's in us.
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000]  And this is again...
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:51.000]  Well, let's talk about what is the globalist end game.
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.000]  Who are the globalists?
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:53.000]  How do we stop them?
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.000]  Stay with us.
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:55.000]  This is the broadcast.
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.000]  They don't want you to hear.
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:01.000]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:05.000]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress,
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:11.000]  you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins and minerals needed daily.
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:16.000]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful vitamin mineral fusion formula.

[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:25.000]  Male eggs experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:29.000]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later,
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:36.000]  we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:40.000]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine.
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:45.000]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase,
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:50.000]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:58.000]  Head to infowarstore.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:04.000]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000]  or heck even take your dog for a walk.
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:12.000]  Believe me, I know I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day,
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:17.000]  but thanks to supermailvitality at infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:23.000]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water,
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:28.000]  to fight back against the modern-day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours,
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:34.000]  to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park,
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:38.000]  and get exercise that you need for your health.
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:42.000]  So go to infowarstore.com and get supermailvitality before it's gone.
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:46.000]  This is actually our last run of supermailvitality.
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:51.000]  So I want you to experience supermailvitality before it's too late.

[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:27.000]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:31.000]  There's an infinity of things I want to talk about with Dr. Nick Baggage.
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:37.000]  The leading individual over the 26, 7 years he's been active, I've been active about 23,
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:41.000]  literally charting what the globalists were doing, what was coming,
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:48.000]  but also predicting a global resistance to it that you predicted would start arising around 2016.
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:49.000]  Right.
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:52.000]  And so I want to give you the floor in this segment because you're bringing up Trump,
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:53.000]  you can't believe he's still breathing.
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000]  You know, obviously you don't like to talk about it,
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:58.000]  but your dad was obviously blown up in a plane and killed.
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000]  A congressman was exposing a lot of this.
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:04.000]  I mean, you've got the inside knowledge, but also the scientific research on what we're dealing with.
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000]  But a lot of people say that who runs it?
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:07.000]  Who are they?
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:08.000]  What's the end game?
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:09.000]  Who's the controlling group?
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:10.000]  We'll talk about that next segment.
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:14.000]  But just getting into all that, there's so many points to talk about.
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000]  Yeah, people are waking up.
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:20.000]  But at the same time, we're so far down the line with this anti-human agenda.
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000]  Well, number one, it doesn't take very many.
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:25.000]  I mean, if you think back on the American Revolution, some say it was two,
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:28.000]  some say it was 6% of the American population thought it was a good idea.
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:29.000]  We're in the new revolution.
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:32.000]  This is a new revolution, not just an American revolution, it's a human revolution.
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000]  It's a change, it's an opportunity.
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:39.000]  Trauma causes people to reconsider the base of our values.
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:42.000]  In that reconsideration, I believe it is going on now.
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:47.000]  And I think when I go back, the predictions weren't based on some esoteric weirdness.
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:50.000]  They were based on the facts, the documents, the things that we had pulled.
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:56.000]  Over 1200 records we used in the books that I've published and over 100,000.
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:59.000]  You could look at the trajectory of what the technocracy wanted.
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:00.000]  Absolutely.
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000]  And it was absolutely clear.
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:06.000]  And if you look at it, the stuff that would have been highly resisted in this part of the world
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000]  was able to be implemented in other parts of the world.
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:11.000]  Think of the China social scoring, which we've talked about on the program before.
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:16.000]  So wherever it works, they like a Lego set or a record set, they test different parts.
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000]  Yeah, and here you could test that perfectly.
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.000]  So what did they get to test?
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:23.000]  All of big data got to test, the Googles, the apples, the Facebooks.
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:27.000]  They got to set up all of their monitoring systems in China to meet their standards
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000]  so they could create social scores for the Chinese.
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:32.000]  And then they took that same overlay, brought it over here,
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000]  and now they're using it commercially and politically.
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:37.000]  And then they lie to Congress, and it comes out today,
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:41.000]  even in Business Insider and Bloomberg, that they are lying to Congress.
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:42.000]  The arrogance.
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:46.000]  Right, and they will continue to lie to Congress as long as Congress doesn't prosecute people.
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000]  And that's my next question.
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:54.000]  When I look, because I'm not super technical, but compared to Congress, I go to these hearings,
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:57.000]  they don't know, they're like idiots. It's scary.
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:00.000]  This is the biggest problem of all.
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:04.000]  In the earlier segment, we were talking about how technology determines which governments are powerful,
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000]  which governments are strong.
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000]  Think about a Congress without science.
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:11.000]  How many scientists do we have in the U.S. Senate?
[01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:12.000]  One doctor.
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000]  They're all a bunch of glad-handing lawyers.
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:15.000]  Right, most of them are.
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000]  So you don't have the technical background.
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000]  So here's what happens.
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:22.000]  They go into a closed hearing to deal with these technologies.
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:25.000]  They cannot take notes, they cannot take their staff,
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:29.000]  and they cannot discuss anything in those hearings outside of the hearing room.
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:34.000]  So here they are, uneducated, in science, unable to ask the right questions
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:38.000]  and demand the right answers, knowing whether they're lying or telling the truth.
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:43.000]  And these are the technologies of this century that decide whether governments are strong or weak
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:46.000]  around the world, our congressmen, our senators.
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:50.000]  And that's how you get a clapper five years ago saying we've never spied on anyone in the U.S.
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000]  when everything's being spied on.
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.000]  I mean, it's like saying the sky's not blue.
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:56.000]  So what do we do?
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:01.000]  I mean, it's not like some elitist thing like, oh my God, I know 10,000 times more than these senators.
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:02.000]  It's scaring me.
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:03.000]  It's not a good feeling.
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:08.000]  No, and I would say this, is a lot of them are just plain misinformed or uninformed.
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:13.000]  And so the key elements for me have always been try and provide information.
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:16.000]  I always encourage people that have listened to me, take the printed material
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000]  because all of ours is heavily footnoted.
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:22.000]  And when they have relationships with their congressmen, their senators, or people moving up,
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:23.000]  give them the material.
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000]  It's well-documented, well-footnoted.
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000]  It's not opinion pieces.
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:31.000]  And start to inform and recognize that every sovereign citizen has the ability
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:34.000]  to step in and take a little step in that direction.
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:39.000]  So the Chai comms and the EU and these big corporations are way ahead of our governments.
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:42.000]  They've already launched this total AI takeover program.
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:45.000]  Looking at it, you like to get into nuts and bolts.
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:46.000]  That's great, I do too.
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:50.000]  But at the end of the day, it looks more like an arms race towards technocracy
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:56.000]  and arms race towards AI where all these different factions are battling to get the best AI
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:00.000]  because they believe it will give them life extension of the keys of the universe.
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000]  And it's almost like a crazy gold rush.
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000]  Like we're saying, what's their master plan?
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:08.000]  Their master plan is keep us in La La Land while they invade the future.
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:09.000]  Well, here's the thing.
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:10.000]  It's almost a contrast.
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:13.000]  On the one hand, you have what we are as created human beings
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:18.000]  and what our latent capabilities are as human beings, which have been talked about.
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000]  You know, 2,000 years ago, these capabilities were talked about.
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:26.000]  Then you have the technologies creating sort of the false gifts, if you will.
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:27.000]  Counterfeit.
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:28.000]  Yeah, counterfeit.
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:31.000]  So on the one hand, man wants to be what man has been created to be.
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:34.000]  But on the other hand, I don't think the globalists are...
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.000]  No, I agree.
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:38.000]  They're telling us we're crap and failed and they're going to transcend us
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:41.000]  because they don't have access to that, and that's definitely true.
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:45.000]  And when I look at leaders, I mean, I've met a lot of national leaders.
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000]  I've met a lot of people in high position.
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:50.000]  In all of them, every one of them has a deep philosophy.
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:54.000]  And if you can get into that, if you can find out what their core is,
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:57.000]  then you can see how what they really, truly manifest in the world.
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:00.000]  And it's really getting into the value system, the base of a person,
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000]  and how they project into the world and whether they carry that.
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:06.000]  Let me ask you this, not to get into info wars, but why are they...
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000]  Because they are definitely upset about info wars.
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:09.000]  Because it works.
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:10.000]  Because it works.
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:11.000]  Because the public gets engaged.
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:15.000]  People who listen, 70 million listeners globally, more or less.
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:16.000]  That's a conservative number.
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000]  Yeah, they've dialed us back again.
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:23.000]  But when you look at that many people that become energized with knowledge
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:27.000]  that they can then act on and because many of the hosts, many of us,
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:30.000]  give people some ideas of what you might be able to do even, you know,
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000]  step into it, you know, contact people.
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:33.000]  They don't like the empowerment.
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000]  That is really what it's about.
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.000]  Because when people...
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:37.000]  That's it, we're empowering.
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.000]  That's exactly it.
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:39.000]  That's the whole...
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:40.000]  Because it's not a cult.
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:41.000]  We're saying, no, you're the leader.
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.000]  Right.
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:46.000]  And this is the difference is when people recognize that true leadership
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000]  is an upside down pyramid.
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:51.000]  All right, leaders are on the bottom holding up each level as it goes.
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:54.000]  The way the globalists do it is the opposite.
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000]  The guy at the top is pressing down the populations.
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000]  It's exactly the opposite.
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:26:59.000]  Exactly.
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:02.000]  The globalists think we're idiots because we want to empower the general public.
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:03.000]  That's where the real...
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:04.000]  All this...
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000]  Everything shows that's where the real spark is.
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000]  Well, then go back to the founding fathers.
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:09.000]  It was about the individual.
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000]  It was about the sovereignty of the individual.
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:15.000]  The gifts given by the creator to the individual that we got to express
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000]  within our world, within our government.
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:21.000]  And look how much that's changed from a population that was geared
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.000]  towards building our own program in defense
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000]  was not about defending someone else's interest.
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000]  It was about defending our homes.
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:33.000]  And so we've gone from defending our homes and defending our value systems
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.000]  to try and shoving certain value systems that other people throw
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000]  that truly don't represent the average American.
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:43.000]  And this is what I find also is when I travel, people like Americans.
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:44.000]  I don't care where you go.
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000]  They like Americans generally.
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000]  They don't like our government very much.
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000]  Now, what does that tell you?
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.000]  This government does not reflect Americans very well.
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000]  It doesn't reflect our character very well.
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:58.000]  It doesn't reflect our value systems and who we are very well.
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:01.000]  And the whole left-right paradigm doesn't reflect either.
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:04.000]  No, it doesn't because that is not what it was about.
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000]  It was about invigorated debate.
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.000]  The press, this is why info wars still exist and why it's powerful
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:13.000]  because that First Amendment that talked about freedom of the press,
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000]  it wasn't about saying whatever you want.
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:20.000]  It was about keeping you informed so you could decide how this ship sails.
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000]  So you could decide what was important in the government.
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000]  And so you as individuals could decide.
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:25.000]  Exactly.
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:28.000]  They don't want the general public putting in their two cents.
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:29.000]  And we're individuals.
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:30.000]  This is paradox.
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000]  I'm an individual collectivist.
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.000]  We have individualism.
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000]  But then when we individually see what's right,
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:38.000]  we build a collective that's actually from the people
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000]  that they fear not the top-down false collective.
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:41.000]  And that's exactly right.
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:45.000]  This is where it rises from the dust of who we are into the strength of who we are.
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:48.000]  So they fear the group consciousness collective.
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:49.000]  Absolutely.
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.000]  That is exactly it.
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000]  That is the key to our success.
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:57.000]  Right there is plugging into who we are as individuals and expressing it together.
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:02.000]  Introducing the final and biggest sail of 2018.
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:06.000]  Info wars is proud to introduce the 12 days of Christmas.
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:10.000]  And it's bigger than any previous sail before as this sail just escalates.
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:13.000]  As we attempt to clear out all of our amazing inventory
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:17.000]  to escape the dreaded inventory tax at the end of the year.
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:21.000]  So get great products and help funding them for right now with the 12 days of Christmas
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:27.000]  that is special amongst a group of incredible sales.
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:32.000]  Up to 75% off on top sellers including free shipping, double patriot points
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000]  and unprecedented daily specials.
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000]  Santa Claus isn't real.
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:39.000]  But the new world order and the globalists trying to destroy our nation's sovereignty.
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:42.000]  And trying to shut down the free press is.
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000]  And that's why when you get great products at infowarstore.com
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:47.000]  you don't just give yourself the gift of high quality supplements
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:50.000]  or storeable foods or incredible water filtration.
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:53.000]  No, you give yourself the gift of funding the First Amendment
[01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:56.000]  in a desperate attempt to save this country.
[01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:00.000]  Even though info wars has delivered the fight against tyranny like no other

[01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000]  the spirit of liberty and Americana.
[01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000]  The truly is the Christmas spirit.

[01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:50.000]  4 to 5 colloidal silver iodine and more is now 55% off at infowarstore.com.
[01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:54.000]  I want to thank you all again for making the entire info war possible.
[01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:57.000]  Again, you are the resistance.
[01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:01.000]  Everybody knows that history documents it
[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:05.000]  but there is a cult in every culture and every system throughout history
[01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000]  that wants to hurt children.
[01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:08.000]  They want to abort children.
[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000]  They want to disease children.
[01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.000]  They want to abuse children.
[01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:12.000]  They want to confuse children.
[01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000]  They want their essence.
[01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.000]  They want their soul.
[01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:16.000]  They want their spirit.
[01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:20.000]  They want their power because they are our future.
[01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000]  And this Christmas remember it is about Jesus Christ,
[01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000]  not ultimate sacrifice.
[01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:25.000]  It is about the West.
[01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:28.000]  It is about a human future and standing with each other
[01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000]  and believing in a better future.
[01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000]  I want to thank you all for your support
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:35.000]  but I want to ask you all to pray for your own family,
[01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000]  to pray for America, to pray for President Trump
[01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000]  and to pray for Info Wars
[01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:43.000]  and to remember that you have the power to change the world.
[01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000]  You have the power to override the sensors.
[01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:48.000]  You have the power to stop the globalists dead in their tracks.
[01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:51.000]  I know you have been taking action and I salute you
[01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000]  but just remember, I know you are humble
[01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:58.000]  but just remember you hold the future of this planet and the universe in your hands.
[01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:01.000]  Info Wars has been proven absolutely on target
[01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:04.000]  about world government, the attack on the family,
[01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:07.000]  the eugenics operations, the whole thing.
[01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:08.000]  We have been proven dead on.
[01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000]  You have been proven dead on as supporters
[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000]  and listeners of this project.
[01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000]  You have been the men and women in the arena
[01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000]  and I really do thank you and salute you.
[01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000]  All words are not enough.
[01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:21.000]  Think about all the different systems,
[01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000]  all the different political ideologies
[01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000]  that you have been on target,
[01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:28.000]  promoting Americana and Renaissance,
[01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000]  an open free society against the globalists
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000]  and the dominant world force.
[01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000]  They have created a tower of babel
[01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000]  with a bunch of people that can't communicate with each other
[01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000]  but we have cut right to the chase.
[01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000]  Human liberty, a pro-human future
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000]  versus the globalist anti-human future.
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000]  That's why I want to thank you all
[01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000]  and ask you now more than ever
[01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000]  to remember that Info Wars really is your baby.
[01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000]  I am in your hands
[01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000]  and we are under unprecedented attack
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000]  and we just need you to go to infowars4.com
[01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000]  for the best deals ever
[01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:25.000]  for a true 360 win.
[01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000]  I am here in the middle of that right now.
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:31.000]  Dr. Nick Begich, awesome guy, best-selling author, scientist,
[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000]  one of the number one, probably the number one guy
[01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:36.000]  upfront exposing the technocracy angle of this
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000]  in the last 26, 27 years.
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000]  He'll be on David Knight's show tomorrow.
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000]  He'll be on my broadcast.
[01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000]  He'll be on the War Room throughout the week
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:47.000]  with the shows we do from 8 a.m. Central
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000]  till 6 at night.
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000]  We're going to be adding new shows here very, very soon
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000]  InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000]  We're all over the map during the break,
[01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000]  because Trump's still alive.
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000]  Why the globalists hate him so much?
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000]  How he's trying to release all of these secret technologies?
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000]  Who actually runs the globalists?
[01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000]  How they keep it compartmentalized?
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000]  Just get into all your top points here.
[01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:10.000]  I would say, you know, when you start to think about globalism,
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:13.000]  it is really a subbankers' cabal from my perspective.
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000]  It's primarily economic interest.
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000]  The big old families that like to keep everything.
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000]  Which then dehumanizes.
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000]  It all sees us as human resource.
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000]  That's exactly it. And you hear it in the media.
[01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000]  That's why it so dehumanizes.
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000]  We're reduced to consumers,
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000]  taxpayers.
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000]  And why it's obsessed with getting us into
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000]  a digital world government which they admit
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000]  because then they really control us.
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000]  And Americans, whether we realize it or not,
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000]  all the data that we have on us
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000]  that has been collected
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000]  and collated and warehoused
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000]  is now, and we said this,
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000]  it would come that we would be able to sort that data
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000]  and now they can.
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000]  So the idea of individual profiling is so precision
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000]  and able to predict what you're going to do,
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000]  where you're going to do it, how you're going to live.
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000]  And I said in Friday's segment,
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000]  one of the ways to start to disrupt this system
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000]  is do searches that are exactly the opposite
[01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000]  of what you would normally do.
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000]  Do 10 of them a day.
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000]  And you start to mess up their ability
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000]  to profile you accurately.
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000]  And it's actually in your interest.
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000]  Think about the issues you're really interested in
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000]  and then know your side of the story.
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000]  But then take a look at the contrarian side.
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000]  Just dive into it and pull that data in.
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000]  And now you're better framed A for your own debate
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000]  against those that have differing opinions of yours
[01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000]  because you know their arguments, you know yours.
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000]  Secondly, you throw the globalist off
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000]  in terms of who you are and how to profile you
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:32.000]  because you're no longer doing what so many liberals did
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000]  in dropping into their bubble world
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000]  where all of a sudden, you know, and they see it.
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000]  And instead of letting it all be a one-way scientific algorithm
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:41.000]  studying you, you start manipulating it
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:44.000]  or even telling it other stuff you want it to look at.
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000]  Like I was sitting in this morning with some folks having breakfast
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000]  at Fredericksburg with my wife and kids
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000]  and we were looking at how Hitler crazily
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:53.000]  when he got Satan's seat out of Babylon
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000]  see the Pergamon and built it
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000]  and those big Nazi speeches, he's saying,
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000]  I'm Lucifer, I'm God. How crazy is that?
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000]  That's mainline history folks.
[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000]  If you think I'm kidding, just type in
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000]  Hitler, Satan's seat.
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000]  And I said, what's something ridiculous?
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000]  And there was a picture of Tom Selleck on the wall
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000]  because he visited the restaurant.
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:14.000]  We said, let's all do searches with Tom Selleck now.
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000]  So we searched Satan's seat.
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000]  Next we did Tom Selleck, sorry.
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000]  This is exactly it.
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000]  Somebody somewhere is going to develop a computer program
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000]  that you can just kind of run in the background.
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000]  See, this would be ideal.
[01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000]  Have a computer program running.
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:31.000]  Just sending out all these false searches all day long.
[01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000]  And we just saw Tom Selleck on the wall.
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000]  Tom Selleck. Right.
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000]  And this is the kind of thing that messes him up.
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000]  And you can't avoid it anymore.
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:42.000]  And when you think about, again, the shaping of culture,
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000]  you cannot avoid it anymore.
[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000]  You see, where individuals was collective,
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000]  I was doing that this morning and you just said it.
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000]  Yeah. And here we are.
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000]  And this is how it actually works.
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:56.000]  This is the actual aspect of it, is you and I are joined
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000]  as brothers in the work that we do.
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:01.000]  And just because of who we are as human beings, we all are.
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000]  We just don't always recognize it.
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000]  We don't always wake up to it.
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:08.000]  And we get closer and closer synced as humanity moves to the next level.
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:11.000]  And then you say left and I go left and you say right
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:14.000]  and I go right and I say right and you're already there.
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:18.000]  Because we're in sync in it.
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000]  And Anne and I had this discussion.
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:23.000]  She's traveling with me this week and we had this discussion earlier today
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:28.000]  about the idea of how finely toned intuition is becoming.
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000]  The more you listen to it.
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000]  Well, you said this 20 years ago and I'm like, okay, a little bit.
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:35.000]  It's happening. I can't believe it now.
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000]  It's like you're either in sync or you're not.
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000]  Yeah. And that's exactly it.
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:42.000]  The best segment I did with Rob do when I was down here at the last time
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:45.000]  where we really got into the meat of this.
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:48.000]  And it was one of the best segments that I ever, ever did.
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:52.000]  And the feedback on that was the name of we should put that back on.
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:55.000]  It was breaking the zombie trance.
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000]  Dr. Nick Beck is breaking the zombie trance.
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000]  And it was great.
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:02.000]  I mean, in terms of explaining those details and you know where it started.
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000]  It started over dinner when you and I were talking that night
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000]  and we were all having dinner.
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:09.000]  And I had said to you about we were talking about trauma
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:12.000]  and how it changes us, how it alters us, how it makes us way different
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:15.000]  than otherwise we might be.
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000]  In other words, the challenge.
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000]  But instead of being losers, we use the trauma for strength.
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000]  For strength to learn from.
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:25.000]  And we just stopped by Oh Henry's house here in Austin today.
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:29.000]  And there was a line that I read and it was about when he went to prison here.
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000]  And that's where he did his writing.
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:34.000]  That's where he changed in the worst of his life.
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:39.000]  He's in prison. He becomes the writer, the writer of the of the last century
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:43.000]  that produced so much great material, but it came out of his trauma.
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:46.000]  Where I changed in my life was my dad disappeared.
[01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:49.000]  It changed me profoundly altered who I was.
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000]  You want to know who runs this?
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:52.000]  I want to know.
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000]  And I wanted to know then.
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:57.000]  And I wanted also know what is the way through this.
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:00.000]  And I believe we're in that way through this.
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000]  I think people are awakening around.
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:05.000]  That was a congressman, but a good Democrat.
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000]  What was it? Old fashioned Democrat?
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000]  What was it he was doing wrong that made them so mad?
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000]  Well, he was doing a couple things.
[01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:16.000]  One, he was transferring national resources back to Native American population in Alaska.
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:21.000]  And over at that time, they wanted to give 20 million to settle this Native American claims.
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:22.000]  But it's worth trillions.
[01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:23.000]  And what they turned into.
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:24.000]  How much is it worth?
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:27.000]  It's unbelievable trillions and trillions.
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:32.000]  Okay, because what it turned into was 44 million acres, not 20, and it included the surface state,
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:35.000]  the mineral rights, the water rights, and all rights that ran with the land.
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:38.000]  And so, and they got priority selection from all federal lands.
[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:44.000]  So they got to go in and select and basically make sure that their treasury was intact
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000]  and that they reclaimed some of the resources.
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:47.000]  The globalists didn't want.
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:51.000]  And in fact, my dad in Congress, his freshman year in Congress, he got this past,
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:54.000]  unheard of the biggest native land claims in American history,
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:40:00.000]  settling with over half of the Native American tribes recognized in the United States or in Alaska.
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000]  So this was a huge, huge settlement.
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000]  But what it did is transfer wealth.
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:07.000]  The biggest domestic companies in Alaska, in Alaska, Alaska-based companies,
[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:12.000]  are those very native corporations that were formed then and grew and developed their resources.
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000]  They produce billions of dollars.
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:17.000]  And Trump's been doing the same thing saying we should get the people involved in Western wealth.
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000]  That's not a looting of that.
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:22.000]  It's just amazing, though, to just see how crazy this is.
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:25.000]  And we have been fighting in Alaska for over 40 years for the opening of Anwar.
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:26.000]  And Trump did it.
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000]  Trump did it in his first couple years.
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:29.000]  We're going to go to break.
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000]  You're going to be back this whole week getting the big picture of news behind it.
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:35.000]  But a few minutes, because I know you get attacked for, you've been a Democrat, whatever,
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:36.000]  but you're independent.
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:39.000]  But Trump, I mean, why do they hate him so much?
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:42.000]  They hate Trump because he is not part of their team.
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:45.000]  And he is actually delivering on his promises.
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000]  And I mean, he talked about the economy.
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:48.000]  He talked about trade.
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000]  He renegotiated NAFTA in three months.
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000]  People out of TPP.
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:53.000]  I love Tucker Carlson.
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:41:01.000]  But Tucker was a little wrong saying Trump didn't deliver on abortion or on getting totally rid of Obamacare.
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000]  Trump's done all the other stuff.
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:04.000]  It's happened.
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:05.000]  I don't know how you expect it.
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000]  You know, there's some things he's not going to be able to do.
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:08.000]  All right.
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:09.000]  And people have to acknowledge that.
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000]  But the important things he is doing, he's dealing with immigration.
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000]  He's dealing with taxation.
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:16.000]  I mean, the major overhaul and taxes that just happened.
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000]  I mean, he finally is taxing U.S.
[01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000]  corporations on their foreign income for the first time.
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000]  I'm not even that wealthy.
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:26.000]  My taxes went up, but I saw it go down for everybody that works here.
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:27.000]  Everybody else.
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000]  I realized, God, this is like actually a whole fashion Democrat.
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:34.000]  I mean, it was like he got rid of the property tax write-offs for people.
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:35.000]  Right.
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000]  Which he kept the ones for the average person, $1,000.
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:41.000]  But like the Democrats that don't pay any tax, they put it in their $100 million house.
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000]  It just inflates the prices for everybody.
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:44.000]  He killed that.
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:45.000]  Right.
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:46.000]  Which are him.
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:47.000]  Yeah.
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000]  That really scares them.
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:50.000]  Well, here's the thing.
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:54.000]  You know, I sat with my family on election night when Trump was elected.
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000]  And my son and I voted for Trump.
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:59.000]  And we were the only ones in our family, I think they did.
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000]  Brothers was U.S. Senator all the way up.
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:02.000]  Right.
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000]  And we had some, we had the liveliest debates.
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:05.000]  I can tell you that night.
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:09.000]  In fact, we felt like, okay, let this go because I knew Trump was going to win.
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:13.000]  I knew when he filed, he was going to win because of two reasons.
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:14.000]  One is he was a disruptor.
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:17.000]  People were looking for disruption of the, of what was going on in the status quo.
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000]  And secondly, he was authentic.
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:25.000]  He, I mean, I got to say he can be an ass, but he's America's ass.
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:26.000]  And sometimes you need one.
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:30.000]  You need someone tough enough, hard enough that will hammer back for a change
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000]  instead of always backing off and falling down.
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000]  And he's the one that is not backing down.
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:37.000]  I'm going to say all these other lawyers and people can't handle it.
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000]  Look, you're going to get a maniac bull that doesn't care.
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:40.000]  That's right.
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:41.000]  But he's, he's straightforward.
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000]  He is who he is.
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000]  And that's who America collected.
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000]  Whether people like it or not, everybody.
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:50.000]  Dr. Nick Beckins is on fire and he's in the studio the next three days
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000]  at infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000]  Final Sunday segment straight ahead.
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000]  And then counter think with Mike Adams.
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:01.000]  In the last few months, info wars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory
[01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000]  of many of our best selling items.
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:06.000]  And then I came up with the idea last week, let's not just extend the sale
[01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:09.000]  of free shipping store wide 50 to 75% off double patriot points.
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:15.000]  Let's extend that sale, but also add a free gift with every order.
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:19.000]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride free, colloidal silver, iodine four to five super blue,
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:24.000]  you'll get a free gift of a best selling t-shirt while supplies last.
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:28.000]  And what I mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling out.
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:33.000]  So whatever you order that day, there'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out.
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:36.000]  And then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders.
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:41.000]  So in the next 12 days, we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had.
[01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000]  So this is a loss leader.
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:44.000]  We are losing money on this.
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything.
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:54.000]  And don't fight the crowds in four store dot com in four's life dot com or triple eight two five three three one three nine.
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:55.000]  God bless you.
[01:43:55.000 --> 01:44:17.000]  And thank you for your support.
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:53.000]  Thank you.
[01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:57.000]  We are the renaissance and we are winning.
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:27.000]  They began studying this effect in published trials.
[01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:35.000]  And decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000]  It is not an antihistamine.
[01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:44.000]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase,
[01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:49.000]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:52.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:57.000]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.

[01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:24.000]  Alex Jones
[01:47:49.000 --> 01:48:04.000]  The Globalists have offered you opportunities and at one I remember you talking on the air about 10 million a year.
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:07.000]  And you said no, which was a signal to them that you're not corruptible.
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:14.000]  Something similar happened to my dad when Aliasco Pipeline Corporation came into his office and tried to bribe him.
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:19.000]  My dad was in his inner office, so his staff's all in the other room. They tried to bribe him. My dad was not a violent man.
[01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:24.000]  He was a very calm guy, but he literally picked the guy up by the back of his collar in the seat of his pants,
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:30.000]  and he skidded him across the Longworth Building hallway floor, which is about 20 feet wide,
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:34.000]  and told him they just about lost it because if it wasn't so important for Alaska,
[01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:37.000]  that would have been the end of that piece of legislation, but he was incorruptible.
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000]  And that was the same thing that they realized about you.
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:43.000]  So what is the solution? The solution is to try and silence your speech.
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:49.000]  And this is why it is so critically important right now for listeners of this program to support this program,
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:55.000]  to look at the info store and look what's held there and what's sold there, because these are the ways that this thing stays on.
[01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:59.000]  It doesn't happen by itself. It happens because this is your network. This is your information.
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:06.000]  But expanding on that, it's just them speaking out. They don't want info wars because it's populist and it's pro-human.
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000]  These globalists want to shut it all down.
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:12.000]  That's right. And you're just the first. I mean, you're going to see this come against everyone.
[01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:20.000]  And this is why even some of the strong liberal scholars are starting to talk about the fact that this can't happen in America.
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:26.000]  Freedom of speech is about being able to say what we want. People do not have a right to not be offended.
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:29.000]  Well, don't you love how, though, when they come after us, they always misrepresent what we said.
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:32.000]  Absolutely. Every time they edit it, they take it like, it's never what we said.
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:38.000]  No, they never give you enough time. They never give you the full scoop. They only take that.
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:44.000]  The satire. I mean, it's actually satire when you're delivering it and they try to make it sound like it's something.
[01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:45.000]  Let me ask you this statement.
[01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:50.000]  You studied the technocrats. You said, don't worry about chemicals. It's the electromagnetic that they're really doing.
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:55.000]  The Chinese government with their 5G, the arrest of the head of this company with chips and all the phones.
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:50:03.000]  I mean, we're in a total war. I don't even know that behind the scenes, there's a huge war for this country to even survive.
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:10.000]  What would you quantify that as? And how do these mad scientists, how do they communicate? How do they interface?
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000]  How do they run this system?
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:17.000]  A lot of them don't even see it. They're just in their little knot hole looking at their little pieces.
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:20.000]  Because they're only following mathematics. It's sociopathic.
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:25.000]  Yeah, they're just looking at it. And actually, sociopathic behaviors and leadership is not uncommon.
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:26.000]  In fact, there were some studies.
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:27.000]  It's rewarded.
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:32.000]  Yeah. In fact, it is rewarded because they're the ones who are unfortunately the head of many companies,
[01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:35.000]  the heads of many banks, and the heads of many governments.
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:43.000]  So because they're totally cold-blooded and go bottom line, which means cutting out other people's free market systems, then that's how they get ahead.
[01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:50.000]  That's exactly it. It's about stomping on the other guy on your way up and using people as stepping stones.
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:53.000]  And so many of these folks, and this is where the dehumanization of it has happened,
[01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:58.000]  we are divinely created as human beings to do something in this world.
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:02.000]  And it has to do with stewardship. It has to do with our fundamental obligation.
[01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:06.000]  Well, it's a test. You're a smart guy. What is human's ultimate mission?
[01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:12.000]  I think it is a test. You know, this is about a test of who we are at the same time as our opportunity to damage people.
[01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:17.000]  Pretty obvious. We're on a planet, way out in the middle of nowhere. We're given incredible power.
[01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:22.000]  And we're learning. We're here to learn. And we learn through our trauma, through our problems, through our errors.
[01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:25.000]  This was a message of forgiveness for goodness' sake.
[01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:29.000]  This is the idea of falling down, standing up, and straightening out.
[01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:32.000]  You know, it's about being responsible, being accountable.
[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:35.000]  So the people taking over and trying to go, oh my God, humans have incredible potential.
[01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:39.000]  Let's wall it off, dumb them down so we get it. They're failing the test.
[01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:43.000]  That's exactly it. Because if they keep you in this constant state of fear and anxiety,
[01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:47.000]  you cannot reach your higher states of awareness, your higher states of consciousness.
[01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:51.000]  What divinely has been created in us cannot manifest in fear.
[01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:56.000]  That's why when the angel arrives, the first message out of the angel's mouth is fear not.
[01:51:56.000 --> 01:52:01.000]  Let me spend on that. People see what I do kind of frantic and think, oh, he's scared. It's the opposite.
[01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:05.000]  I intellectually and spiritually make a decision. I see it's right. Then I get frantic.
[01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:08.000]  Like your house is on fire. Warning, you get out of it's on fire.
[01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:12.000]  And people think, oh, he's trying to push fear. No, it's the opposite. It's the message of not fear.
[01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:17.000]  It's a warning. It's a warning. Okay. And so the balance between that is sometimes difficult.
[01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:21.000]  You know, you and I have very different styles, but we have the same message.
[01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:25.000]  And so some listeners can hear my message and others can't. They can hear yours.
[01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:30.000]  This is why it takes a cord of people and that's what this network is.
[01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:37.000]  I just can't believe that more people don't, it's such an easy choice, pro-human, pro-future, versus globalism.
[01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000]  You can just, the stench is just...
[01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:45.000]  But you know, it overwhelms a lot of people. Think about how most of us work.
[01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:48.000]  You know, everybody's working all day. They come home. They're tired.
[01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:51.000]  And they don't want to hear about some big giant global cabal. They got to fight.
[01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:54.000]  Nope. They're watching entertainment TV, right?
[01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:58.000]  I mean, think about the junk on television, how hard it is to sort through anything worthwhile.
[01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000]  But it's basically to divert, to distract.
[01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:01.000]  It's jamming.
[01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:04.000]  It's just jamming. Exactly what it is. You could call it jamming.
[01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:07.000]  It's the best word for it because even the advertising.
[01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:10.000]  Think about it. It's talking about how you smell. It's talking about your breath.
[01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:11.000]  It's talking about...
[01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000]  Oh, your hair fell out. Women don't want you.
[01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:17.000]  Right. All this stuff, and it generates anxiety, fear, and questioning yourself,
[01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:20.000]  questioning your self-image, questioning who you are as a human being.
[01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000]  Those are all important things.
[01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:28.000]  But stepping beyond that and knowing that we are created divinely, perfectly,
[01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:32.000]  and we need to start to recognize, fall more into that of who we are, and resist...
[01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:36.000]  Once we get the timelessness and the definitely art data, who we are, goes on forever.
[01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:40.000]  It's not even a debate about it. We know it narrowly. That takes the power away from them.
[01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:45.000]  It does because the fear is gone. When you know this is a snapshot between short interviews...
[01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:48.000]  So, how do you deal with the fear of not delivering?
[01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000]  Because I'm not afraid of them killing me or taking...
[01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:53.000]  I am afraid of not doing enough to stop them.
[01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:57.000]  You and I have had this discussion. I had it with you at that restaurant a year and a half ago,
[01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:58.000]  and I remember it clearly.
[01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:02.000]  And what I would say, Alex, is you run 110% all the time.
[01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:08.000]  God doesn't require it of us. 90% is good enough because God wants that 10% reserved for you
[01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000]  to lift you up.
[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:14.000]  And so, I would say this, we do our best.
[01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:18.000]  That's all that's ever required. It's not always succeeding. It's doing our best.
[01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:22.000]  And I know that about Alex Jones. Every day he does his best.
[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000]  And given that 10%...
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:28.000]  I think that's what they hate, though, is that they know that we have feelings,
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:31.000]  and they claim we're weak because we have feelings. No, we're alive because we have feelings.
[01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:36.000]  We are human beings, and we feel all of those emotions.
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:40.000]  And that's what makes us human beings. That's what makes every one of us human beings.
[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:43.000]  So then, who are these corporate guys? They don't even have feelings.
[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:48.000]  They don't have it because they've lost their compassion. They've lost touch with who they are.
[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000]  You know, the intuition I was talking about earlier that we don't listen to,
[01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:53.000]  if you quit listening to it, that's also your conscience.
[01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000]  That's the part that tells you right and wrong what you shouldn't and shouldn't do.
[01:54:55.000 --> 01:55:00.000]  When you turn it off enough, it no longer registers. That's the sociopath.
[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:05.000]  So, feeling, knowing who you are, expressing your emotions freely, this is what makes us human.
[01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:10.000]  I agree, but what happens then when you always answer it and it turns up,
[01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:14.000]  and then it's like a big antenna drawing it all in, then that's what's crazy.
[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000]  Well, and it happens, but here's what also happens.
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:19.000]  You know, and it's moths to the light, right?
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:22.000]  Something else I've heard from man is moths to the light.
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:26.000]  You know, your bright spot in the world, they attract all of this nonsense,
[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000]  because it needs, it is attractive.
[01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:31.000]  Let me ask this in closing, and you're going to come back this whole week and I've counted,
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:36.000]  or you can do whole videos if you want to, just yourself talking, some people there, what you have to say.
[01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:39.000]  Certainly the energy of the Earth's going off the chart right now. I can't even handle it.
[01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:43.000]  I mean, you call what you want, it's like, it is wild right now.
[01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000]  What would you call it? The quickening you predicted, but it's here.
[01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:50.000]  Oh yeah, it's here, and I would say it's a reflection both of our own consciousness and what's happening.
[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:53.000]  When you see disruption and people, you'll see disruption in the planet.
[01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:57.000]  These things are all connected. There are no systems separated, and science shows that to us today.
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:03.000]  So as human beings express all of this negative emotion, you're going to see a lot of things within the Earth, traumatic things within the Earth.
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:08.000]  I just went through a 7.0 worth break in Alaska, and the biggest message for us in Alaska is,
[01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:12.000]  within three days we were all up and running before the afternoon was done,
[01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:16.000]  the grocery stores were opening and the gas stations were running, and within a week people were back in school,
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:23.000]  because we know what trauma is in this realm, and we can overcome it, just like people with hurricanes in the South and other places.
[01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:30.000]  And notice the globalists try to remove overt trauma, but covert trauma to control us.
[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000]  They don't want people to...
[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:35.000]  No, they don't want to connect, and here's what happens in those traumas.
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:39.000]  We connect with one another. All of a sudden, all the political stuff goes away,
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:44.000]  and we recognize each other on our foundational, who we are as divine humans, and we begin to help each other.
[01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:47.000]  By the way, I've tried three times during the break to get you to plug.
[01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:53.000]  If you want, we sell them at infostore.com, people can go to earthpulse.com and get your DVDs, your books, all of it.
[01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:56.000]  It's amazing information. We want the real science, mind control.
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:03.000]  When you come back this week, they just declassified more mind control, MK Ultra, so we're proven right yet again.
[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:06.000]  Hey, I appreciate being on with you, and I appreciate everything you guys do.
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000]  Hey, let me hear your prediction.
[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:11.000]  Are they going to take Trump out, or is it up to us?
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:19.000]  I think it's up to us to continue to support this man as much as we can, to try and get him the information he needs.
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:24.000]  I think that's the biggest thing, because he's got a lot of feed coming in, and he needs information.
[01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:29.000]  What you just said, the enemy, they most fear our information getting to him.
[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:30.000]  That's right.
[01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:34.000]  Because they say, God, he sees M4s, or he just goes with it, because he already knows it.
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:37.000]  Yep, and because it hits him in his core.
[01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:42.000]  He's someone who acts on what he knows, and sometimes it's like, okay, it's all over the map.
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000]  But once he knows, he acts.
[01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:45.000]  That's right.
[01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:53.000]  We need to build back, and we visit the foundations of our freedom.
[01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:57.000]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for.
[01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:04.000]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions.
[01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:08.000]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals
[01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:11.000]  taking those God-given rights from us as individuals.
[01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:14.000]  You better understand that, because they're taking them right now.
[01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000]  We have seen what they want to do.
[01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000]  They called it UN Agenda 21.
[01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000]  Now they call it the UN 2030 Agenda.
[01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:26.000]  They want everybody off of the rural lands.
[01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000]  They want people out of the suburbs.
[01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000]  They want to pack everybody into the cities,
[01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:34.000]  because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone.
[01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000]  It's The David Knight Show.
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000]  I've never missed your show.
[01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000]  And he did.
[01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:41.000]  And he's what?
[01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000]  I mean, never.
[01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:52.000]  I don't have to tell our listeners and viewers how important M4 Wars is
[01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000]  in the fight against the anti-human globalists.
[01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000]  So let's say it's short and sweet.
[01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000]  We are your support now, more than ever.
[01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:01.000]  You've come through a thousand times since I'm not bitching at you.
[01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:04.000]  I'm just simply telling you, we are in the thick of the battle now.
[01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:07.000]  The attacks on M4 Wars have become absolutely exponential.
[01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:10.000]  And down the road, we probably will get destroyed.
[01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:13.000]  But I know, and God has really put it on my heart,
[01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:16.000]  that we've got to maintain the fight as hard as possible
[01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:19.000]  and go through as much as we can to be an example to others
[01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:23.000]  and carry out critical operations ahead of whatever happens.
[01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000]  But I want to be strong in this fight.
[01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:26.000]  I need to be provisioned.
[01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:29.000]  And I'm willing to stand against Hillary and Soros and the Rothschilds
[01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000]  and all these devil worshipers.
[01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:32.000]  But I need your prayers.
[01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000]  I need you to spread the articles and videos.
[01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000]  I need you to give us financial support right now.
[01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:37.000]  We make it easy.
[01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000]  Do your Christmas shopping with us, not with the globalists
[01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:42.000]  and not with Bezos and Amazon.
[01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000]  And you'll help provision us.
[01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000]  We've got a bunch of huge deals at M4Wars.com.
[01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:56.000]  So please take action right now.
