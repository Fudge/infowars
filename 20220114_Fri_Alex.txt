[00:00.000 --> 00:25.480]  If you ignore all the huffing and puffing on TV, just look at the video evidence.
[00:25.480 --> 00:29.520]  It's been clear for a while now that the Department of Justice probably had some role in the
[00:29.520 --> 00:34.240]  events of January 6th. It's obvious. After hearings on Capitol Hill today, it became
[00:34.240 --> 00:40.480]  even clearer. Watch Senator Ted Cruz of Texas ask an FBI official called Jill Sanborn point
[00:40.480 --> 00:47.600]  blank whether the FBI was involved. How many FBI agents or confidential informants
[00:47.600 --> 00:55.560]  actively participated in the events of January 6th? Sir, I'm sure you can appreciate that
[00:55.560 --> 01:02.320]  I can't go into the specifics of sources and methods. Did any FBI agents or confidential
[01:02.320 --> 01:08.960]  informants actively participate in the events of January 6th? Yes or no? Sir, I can't answer
[01:08.960 --> 01:17.040]  that. Did any FBI agents or confidential informants commit crimes of violence on January 6th?
[01:17.040 --> 01:24.800]  I can't answer that, sir. Did any FBI agents or FBI informants actively encourage and incite
[01:24.800 --> 01:33.200]  crimes of violence on January 6th? Sir, I can't answer that. Did you hear that? Cruz
[01:33.200 --> 01:39.160]  asked, quote, did any FBI agents or confidential informants commit crimes of violence on January
[01:39.160 --> 01:43.760]  6th? That's what he asked. And the obvious answer is, are you kidding? Come on now. Of
[01:43.760 --> 01:48.320]  course, the FBI isn't secretly committing crimes of violence. That's insane. We're a
[01:48.320 --> 01:53.240]  federal law enforcement agency. We're not the Tan Tan Makut. Next question, please.
[01:53.240 --> 01:56.920]  That's what Jill Sandborn should have said, but that is not what she said. Instead, she
[01:56.920 --> 02:02.800]  replied, quote, I can't answer that. But of course, Jill Sandborn can answer that and
[02:02.800 --> 02:06.760]  she should be forced to answer that immediately. No sources or methods would be revealed. Just
[02:06.760 --> 02:11.600]  answer the question. Did they participate in violence or not? Why is that hard? It tells
[02:11.600 --> 02:16.000]  you a lot. At another point, Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas asked the assistant attorney
[02:16.000 --> 02:20.540]  general, Matt Olson, about Ray Epps. Epps is the man you've seen in multiple videos
[02:20.540 --> 02:25.720]  encouraging the crowd to storm the Capitol, but somehow has never been charged himself.
[02:25.720 --> 02:31.000]  Here's that exchange. Okay. So this is, it gets back to what I, I mean earlier, asking
[02:31.000 --> 02:36.960]  if you prepared for this hearing. You're the assistant attorney general for national security.
[02:36.960 --> 02:41.360]  You run the national security division. The department has said that these January 6th
[02:41.360 --> 02:46.280]  prosecutions are one of their highest priorities. This is the man who was on the most wanted
[02:46.280 --> 02:52.760]  page for six months. Do you really, do you really expect us to believe that you've never
[02:52.760 --> 02:59.200]  heard of the name Ray Epps? You don't know anything about him? I simply don't have any
[02:59.200 --> 03:05.240]  information at all, Senator, about that individual. In other words, they really expect you to
[03:05.240 --> 03:08.720]  believe that quote. I simply don't have any information at all on that individual. So
[03:08.720 --> 03:14.600]  the DOJ knows nothing about Ray Epps, the guy on the most wanted list, right? That's
[03:14.600 --> 03:19.440]  absurdly false. And as if to underscore how absurdly false it is within a short time Democrats
[03:19.440 --> 03:24.240]  in the January 6th committee released a statement claiming that actually they'd already interviewed
[03:24.240 --> 03:29.160]  Ray Epps and anyone who still has questions about his behavior on January 5th or 6th is
[03:29.160 --> 03:33.800]  a dangerous conspiracy theorist quote. Mr. Epps informed us, the committee said in a
[03:33.800 --> 03:38.800]  statement today, that he was not working with employed buyer acting at the direction of
[03:38.800 --> 03:43.000]  any law enforcement agency on January 5th or 6th or at any other time and that he has
[03:43.000 --> 03:49.840]  never been an informant for the FBI or any other law enforcement agency end quote. Wow,
[03:49.840 --> 03:55.520]  bombshell looks like case closed. We can forget about Ray Epps and move on. Sorry we asked.
[03:55.520 --> 04:01.480]  Oh, but wait a second. When exactly and under what circumstances did the committee talk to
[04:01.480 --> 04:07.280]  Ray Epps? Supposedly this interview was conducted in secret last November. If that is true,
[04:07.280 --> 04:11.080]  we don't know that it is, but let's say it is, then why did the committee wait months
[04:11.080 --> 04:16.800]  to tell us today in a tweet? When the committee got its hands on Mark Meadows' text messages,
[04:16.800 --> 04:21.520]  we seem to remember they leaked those to the media within hours. And by the way, was this
[04:21.520 --> 04:26.560]  Ray Epps interview conducted under oath? Did Democrats subpoena his electronic communications
[04:26.560 --> 04:31.240]  as they did with Meadows and so many others? Will the information Epps revealed to the
[04:31.240 --> 04:36.160]  committee be available to the many January 6th defendants who are now awaiting trial?
[04:36.160 --> 04:41.680]  Can their lawyers see a transcript of this interview? Can we see a transcript of this
[04:41.680 --> 04:47.760]  interview? If not, why not? And while we're at it, here's something else that's confusing.
[04:47.760 --> 04:52.560]  Epps is a long time right wing activist. As you know, he urged. All right, folks, we'll
[04:52.560 --> 04:55.920]  be right back. Of course, he doesn't work for the feds. He works for the Southern Probably
[04:55.920 --> 05:06.760]  Law Center.
[05:25.920 --> 05:32.640]  So listen, Paul Revere's, when you spread the word about the broadcast, when you pray
[05:32.640 --> 05:37.280]  for the broadcast, you're the tip of the sphere. And when you buy products at infoarstore.com,
[05:37.280 --> 05:40.760]  you keep us on air. Plus, we've got great products that have been sold out for months
[05:40.760 --> 05:47.120]  that are back in stock, 50% off, X2 and Winter Sun. Both of these are on our top five best
[05:47.120 --> 05:51.280]  sellers. They are so good for your body. And if there's two things you do for your body,
[05:51.280 --> 05:55.840]  it's these two products. They're all back in stock at infoarstore.com, 50% off, and it
[05:55.840 --> 05:58.840]  keeps us on the air. Only way we fail is if you don't take action.
[05:58.840 --> 06:16.400]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance live from Austin, Texas.
[06:16.400 --> 06:22.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. You know, I could cover these hundreds of incredible
[06:22.880 --> 06:28.680]  reports and I will today, but we need to get that 35,000 foot view and talk about what's
[06:28.680 --> 06:36.880]  really happening. America has been captured by very evil multinational corporate crime
[06:36.880 --> 06:44.720]  syndicate run out of the Bilderberg group and its public arm, the Debo's group. And
[06:44.720 --> 06:50.640]  they are not intending to allow the population of the planet to continue on as it is, to
[06:50.640 --> 06:56.800]  say the least. And depopulation is what's been carried out through covert means through
[06:56.800 --> 07:03.000]  the so-called vaccine program and that's now coming out and mounting. And then you ask
[07:03.000 --> 07:09.520]  the logical question, how did the, the, the, the technology engage in this mass murder
[07:09.520 --> 07:14.480]  that's now unfolding with these slow kill, soft kill weapons? How will they get away
[07:14.480 --> 07:22.880]  with that? And the answer is further destabilization. So horrible that you forget the last major
[07:22.880 --> 07:30.200]  insult to the human ecosystem. So we are being treated as a disease, as a cancer to be cut
[07:30.200 --> 07:36.840]  out. And the big lie is people working for the system believe that they are positioning
[07:36.840 --> 07:41.200]  themselves with the winning team and that they are going to be taken care of because
[07:41.200 --> 07:47.640]  they are going to execute this operation. When you read deeper into leaked documents
[07:47.640 --> 07:52.320]  out of the Debo's group and Bilderberg group that we and others got, great danger to ourselves.
[07:52.320 --> 07:57.920]  I should add, a lot of people actually dive for this information. You will then discover
[07:57.920 --> 08:04.040]  that they plan to implode all the western governments and then even have show trials
[08:04.040 --> 08:09.320]  of the bureaucracies that are going to engage in the initiation of the civil war that has
[08:09.320 --> 08:13.240]  already begun and not just here about other parts of the world. So all the ministers in
[08:13.240 --> 08:18.760]  Australia and ministers in the Netherlands and the UK and the U.S. that are doing all
[08:18.760 --> 08:24.120]  of this really believe their position because they went to the Debo's group school, they
[08:24.120 --> 08:29.280]  went to the Bilderberg school, they have a school and that they're on the winning team.
[08:29.280 --> 08:32.760]  But if you actually read some of the deeper stuff that they're not given, no, they're
[08:32.760 --> 08:41.720]  going to all be wiped out as well. So I have prepared myself and I know what this means
[08:41.720 --> 08:48.400]  for me. We are the tip of the spear, the number one organization that exposed all this and
[08:48.400 --> 08:53.960]  I have a sense of satisfaction and I have a sense of being able to look myself in the
[08:53.960 --> 08:58.640]  mirror and a sense of that I'm starting to measure up to my ancestors that were pretty
[08:58.640 --> 09:04.280]  amazing people and that I didn't join these scum. But that means I will be set up and
[09:04.280 --> 09:08.600]  put in prison or killed very soon and let's just get down to being honest about this with
[09:08.600 --> 09:12.760]  you, okay? I don't tell you this, be dramatic, we're at the end of the road here, okay? It's
[09:12.760 --> 09:17.200]  298 days out from the election, they're never going to let us have a free or fair one again
[09:17.200 --> 09:21.080]  and they're going to devalue the dollar, they're going to gut the country and you just need
[09:21.080 --> 09:26.360]  to get right with God and realize we're being judged for abortion. I also want to say that
[09:26.360 --> 09:33.640]  I am not offensively, as I've told you, going to be involved in any type of military operations.
[09:33.640 --> 09:36.840]  You're going to obviously hear that when they state terror attacks, they're already blaming
[09:36.840 --> 09:45.480]  myself and Rush Limbaugh posthumously, in his case, for the January 6 fiasco and the
[09:45.480 --> 09:51.400]  provocateur false flag extravaganza. And so I just, I have to really just get down to
[09:51.400 --> 09:56.720]  brass tacks with you and say, this is the end of the line, okay? And hey, those babies
[09:56.720 --> 10:00.880]  didn't get any protection when they got chopped up in the womb or had acid sprayed on them,
[10:00.880 --> 10:07.680]  so let's just realize that we're being judged and we deserve what we get and so do I. And
[10:07.680 --> 10:13.960]  the people carrying out the evil, they are just instruments of the system that themselves
[10:13.960 --> 10:18.800]  will be absolutely destroyed, it's very, very sad for everybody, but this is what happens
[10:18.800 --> 10:23.680]  when you become a decadent satanic society. Speaking of that, I've got three articles
[10:23.680 --> 10:30.440]  today that really illustrate the little secret ingredient, secret flavor that's not secret
[10:30.440 --> 10:36.000]  anymore of Satanism in this whole thing. This is a mainstream news article, we have it linked
[10:36.000 --> 10:39.840]  here, it's on ABC News is reporting it with a straight face, so is NBC News, it's all
[10:39.840 --> 10:46.240]  over the news, you've seen it, probably seen it. Parents horrified as school host Satan
[10:46.240 --> 11:00.760]  Club for children. So, parents in Illinois were shocked to discover that their children's
[11:00.760 --> 11:07.720]  school approved an event for children organized by the satanic temple. The event titled Satan
[11:07.720 --> 11:16.480]  Club held at the Jane Adams Elementary School, vowed to introduce children to a scientific,
[11:16.480 --> 11:21.880]  rationalist, non superstitious world view. And when you see these Satanists, and I've
[11:21.880 --> 11:25.680]  seen their film they put out that got all the praise for Hollywood, I mean you talk
[11:25.680 --> 11:30.440]  about losers, but my dad calls glow in the dark people, I don't care if they're black
[11:30.440 --> 11:36.120]  or white, they're got like green colored skin and they are translucent and they don't look
[11:36.120 --> 11:45.200]  too happy, do they? These are the slaves of the slaves. They're not even cockroaches
[11:45.200 --> 11:52.800]  of the spiritual world, they're just losers that turned into the energy of Satan and never
[11:52.800 --> 11:58.120]  felt anything like it in their lives, never had a connection to God and just never knew
[11:58.120 --> 12:01.600]  what had happened. Basically they're not even human anymore, they're just demons, they're
[12:01.600 --> 12:07.880]  not basically demons, they are demons and they've never even imagined what they could
[12:07.880 --> 12:13.400]  have had or they would have had communion with the real God, but that's again a great
[12:13.400 --> 12:19.720]  failure of ours, isn't it? So here we are, so we have that little tidbit for you and
[12:19.720 --> 12:24.680]  then we have another Tucker Carlson clip I'm going to play because he's just knocking
[12:24.680 --> 12:30.280]  out of the park every day last night and he just has a way of doing things because it's
[12:30.280 --> 12:36.800]  confirmed now that the Justice Department through the White House went to the Broward
[12:36.800 --> 12:42.080]  County School in Florida and went to the one up in Virginia and a bunch of other schools
[12:42.080 --> 12:47.840]  now we're learning, not just one and said sin letters in through the National Education
[12:47.840 --> 12:52.080]  Association, the National Association of School Districts, all of them, sin letters in that
[12:52.080 --> 12:55.840]  you're scared of the parents and their terrorists and their bad and give us some bad examples
[12:55.840 --> 13:01.680]  of them and then we're going to call in the Justice Department to come in and have the
[13:01.680 --> 13:08.000]  FBI land and helicopters in the case of Virginia and walk in with earpieces and stare at the
[13:08.000 --> 13:12.240]  parents, I mean this is just unbelievable and you're like why are they doing that? Well
[13:12.240 --> 13:18.600]  because the enemy is the parents, the system wants the children, every authoritarian state
[13:18.600 --> 13:23.800]  comes in and takes over the children, every single authoritarian state does this throughout
[13:23.800 --> 13:28.680]  history and it's their price and it's not just because the authoritarian want to brainwash
[13:28.680 --> 13:34.280]  the next generation, they spiritually want the children because they are energetically
[13:34.280 --> 13:38.560]  draining them in all the different things, the pedophilia, the abuse and the brainwashing
[13:38.560 --> 13:45.760]  and manipulating them through trauma based systems to join evil because they believe
[13:45.760 --> 13:54.520]  evil will make them strong, it's about their souls and that's where we are.
[13:54.520 --> 14:01.280]  So of course the Justice Department planned the rollout, I mean you know they tried to
[14:01.280 --> 14:04.640]  go to Waco, they could have arrested Koresh in town at any time, he had a business in
[14:04.640 --> 14:09.920]  town, jogged off the property, he was a marathon runner basically, every day but they didn't
[14:09.920 --> 14:12.720]  want that, they wanted to go shoot up the building and burn up the kids and you know
[14:12.720 --> 14:15.880]  do all the rest of it to start their war on cults.
[14:15.880 --> 14:19.960]  By picking a weird group that was, you know, didn't need to be investigated by CPS I think
[14:19.960 --> 14:23.800]  and didn't need to have you know, but you don't come burn them down for that, no, no,
[14:23.800 --> 14:27.800]  they picked that, they admitted in documents and video to get funding and to start a war
[14:27.800 --> 14:28.880]  with the American people.
[14:28.880 --> 14:32.840]  So pick a group that's weird and that we don't agree with and it's got problems and then
[14:32.840 --> 14:39.680]  once you don't stand up for them, well nobody's gonna stand up for you and so you saw that
[14:39.680 --> 14:47.440]  and then now they've moved on from a splinter group of the Seventh Day Adventists, apocalyptically
[14:47.440 --> 14:53.320]  living out on the plains of central, north central Texas and now they've moved on to
[14:53.320 --> 14:57.600]  oh you don't like drag queen story time, you don't like Satan time, you don't like the
[14:57.600 --> 15:04.400]  local high priest, Satan coming to your school and teaching how Jesus is not real and the
[15:04.400 --> 15:07.760]  devil's not real, remember the devil's the biggest trick, he's telling you kids the
[15:07.760 --> 15:11.360]  devil ain't real, that's why I'm here talking to you about how there's no God and you're
[15:11.360 --> 15:16.400]  all alone with me because you dial into God, now you can go through anything they're gonna
[15:16.400 --> 15:21.080]  throw at you, they don't want you to know you got that spiritual antenna that you're
[15:21.080 --> 15:26.840]  with the Holy Spirit anytime you ask it in, but you deny it and you persecute children,
[15:26.840 --> 15:31.600]  God will close the door and remove the Holy Spirit and damn you while you're alive and
[15:31.600 --> 15:40.360]  once the door is closed, I felt the door closing I was about 17 and oh thank God right as it
[15:40.360 --> 15:45.000]  almost closed I just got the channel and that's everything to me, that's the most important
[15:45.000 --> 15:49.760]  thing you want that connection to God, we're gonna come back and talk more about the Satanist
[15:49.760 --> 15:55.960]  and how your children are basically the gas for their engines, your children are everything
[15:55.960 --> 16:04.000]  to them, destroying your children, Christmas 2021 is over but you've still got a really

[17:46.760 --> 17:50.800]  more comes in in the next month or so because it's a best seller and it's something everybody
[17:50.800 --> 17:53.040]  needs for their immune system and their body.
[17:53.040 --> 17:59.440]  Get your vitamin, mineral, fusion now and support the InfoWare 360 win at infowarstore.com
[17:59.440 --> 18:14.440]  Get our great, a bag of it here, I mean this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas,
[18:14.440 --> 18:15.440]  Mexico, the communists?
[18:15.440 --> 18:16.440]  Well that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested, above organic,
[18:16.440 --> 18:17.440]  in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee and yeah, we buy it from the little
[18:17.440 --> 18:21.440]  farmers that, you know, the media calls communists but really they're just a commune and whatever
[18:21.440 --> 18:25.040]  the point is is that it's good coffee and we've got it and the farmers don't let the
[18:25.040 --> 18:28.160]  Mexican government take over so I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've
[18:28.160 --> 18:30.720]  been buying it for what, 14 years and the price has never gone up.
[18:30.720 --> 18:34.800]  The same stuff's sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound
[18:34.800 --> 18:37.600]  and I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[18:37.600 --> 18:42.200]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas Rebels, literally, in fact, I'm
[18:42.200 --> 18:44.200]  not going to tell you a little story.
[18:44.200 --> 18:49.480]  We had one, I'm not sure if you want to believe it.
[18:49.480 --> 18:54.120]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation and if you don't
[18:54.120 --> 19:04.120]  fund us, you don't want to share, that's fine.
[19:04.120 --> 19:07.120]  Granny Do Right, Granny Do Right, thanks for holding her on the ear.
[19:07.120 --> 19:08.120]  Go ahead.
[19:08.120 --> 19:10.760]  Yeah, and first of all, let me say I love your products.
[19:10.760 --> 19:16.280]  I am a granny and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in
[19:16.280 --> 19:21.960]  the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called but
[19:21.960 --> 19:27.760]  since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous, actually.
[19:27.760 --> 19:33.840]  People think I'm 55 years old and I was already taking your other supplements but I thought,
[19:33.840 --> 19:37.600]  you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless
[19:37.600 --> 19:42.000]  situation but when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately but, you
[19:42.000 --> 19:47.600]  know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket, this is
[19:47.600 --> 19:50.640]  working, this is wonderful, you know.
[19:50.640 --> 19:55.800]  I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know, so anyway, it worked wonderfully
[19:55.800 --> 20:21.680]  and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[20:21.680 --> 20:29.200]  So the mission has been carried out, my operations against the loveless have been executed and
[20:29.200 --> 20:40.120]  now it's time to take it like a man but know this, evil doers, God will punish you, God's
[20:40.120 --> 20:50.120]  leader, you will stare into God's face, you are damned to hell forever, not me, I'm going
[20:50.120 --> 20:56.640]  to go to the next level, all right, here we are, ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to air
[20:56.640 --> 21:03.320]  it next segment because it's so true and it's in the news, it's not Tucker Carlson's opinion
[21:03.320 --> 21:09.080]  that the Justice Department went around to the different, not just in Virginia all over
[21:09.080 --> 21:15.000]  and told them, tell us the public are terrorists and call them terrorists in the letters.
[21:15.000 --> 21:18.440]  I mean, if you ever wanted to know how evil this government is and that it's run by very
[21:18.440 --> 21:25.200]  sick people that want your children, that's their mission, these Pied Piper's, that's
[21:25.200 --> 21:32.440]  what they're doing and when you look at who they are, Jeffrey Epstein, the Clintons, your
[21:32.440 --> 21:41.480]  children are the currency, now I killed my children and I say that, I'm ashamed of that
[21:41.480 --> 21:47.560]  but I'm proud of the fact that I'll be honest with you and as I said they weren't people
[21:47.560 --> 21:55.480]  but God touched my heart and said, I've got a mission for you and you're going to carry
[21:55.480 --> 22:04.680]  this out and you'll be reprieved but if you don't, the door is shut and I want to encourage
[22:04.680 --> 22:12.840]  people that have served the dark side or been evil or had a experience with the dark side
[22:12.840 --> 22:17.520]  to understand that if you can still feel any connection of guilt or any connection to God
[22:17.520 --> 22:20.880]  you can still be saved.
[22:20.880 --> 22:23.800]  Before we cover all this temporal news that's happening in the world, you've got to understand
[22:23.800 --> 22:31.240]  you are an eternal being of light that is energized by God's spirit and God's creation
[22:31.240 --> 22:32.240]  around you.
[22:32.240 --> 22:35.720]  It's like I put an iPhone on a little invisible charging station, you can't see it but it's
[22:35.720 --> 22:44.080]  beaming an end, that's the analogy but Satan is going to send his transmission and his
[22:44.080 --> 22:47.880]  wavelength to you whether you want the transmission or not.
[22:47.880 --> 22:55.160]  God is not going to hit you with the real transmission, the master transmission, the
[22:55.160 --> 23:02.080]  prime transmission unless you're open for that transmission and sin going against God's
[23:02.080 --> 23:06.000]  program blocks that.
[23:06.000 --> 23:10.760]  It's like a faraday cage but still part of it gets through and then as you cut away the
[23:10.760 --> 23:17.040]  sin, the bad you're doing and get aligned with that energy coming to you, even if it's
[23:17.040 --> 23:22.280]  a tiny beam of the Holy Spirit makes it through, within that is the seed of God's larger plan,
[23:22.280 --> 23:26.640]  you can take that and then plant it yourself and it grows and gets bigger and then it becomes
[23:26.640 --> 23:34.600]  more and more and just expands like an explosion and it's that explosion that the Satanists
[23:34.600 --> 23:40.560]  hate, it's that explosion of our will and our psychic energy and our connection to God
[23:40.560 --> 23:47.400]  that they don't like, they want that transmission cut off, that's what the higher orders of
[23:47.400 --> 24:00.040]  the Satanic system want and this is completely energetic, this whole thing is about energy
[24:00.040 --> 24:04.440]  and you don't just think some old oil on the ground can create energy, you don't just
[24:04.440 --> 24:07.800]  think the sun up in the sky can create energy because as amazing as the sun is, it's not
[24:07.800 --> 24:15.000]  alive, it's an ongoing giant thermonuclear explosion.
[24:15.000 --> 24:19.840]  But you can contemplate that in the entire universe and you can contemplate God and you
[24:19.840 --> 24:29.240]  can interface with God, you can commune with God and be lifted up by God in that worship
[24:29.240 --> 24:33.040]  and they don't want you to have any contact with that, they don't want you to have any
[24:33.040 --> 24:36.920]  connection to that, they don't want you to know that's there, they want you in the darkness.
[24:36.920 --> 24:42.480]  In fact, I was telling them come in with one song, come in with, I'm going to live forever
[24:42.480 --> 24:47.720]  by the high woman, we should play that song, we'll come back.
[24:47.720 --> 24:54.640]  Don't let the darkness take them, don't let them be forsaken, just lead them safely to
[24:54.640 --> 25:05.960]  the light, when this whole world's blown asunder and all the stars fall from the sky, no there
[25:05.960 --> 25:14.360]  is someone who really loves you, we'll live forever, you and I, I'm gonna live forever,
[25:14.360 --> 25:21.760]  I'm gonna cross that river, I'm going to reach tomorrow now, yeah let's go ahead and
[25:21.760 --> 25:28.280]  play the song right now, go ahead and play it now, you're gonna want to hold me just
[25:28.280 --> 25:38.040]  like I always told you, I'm gonna live forever, I'm gonna cross that river, I'm gonna catch
[25:38.040 --> 25:46.800]  tomorrow now, you're gonna want to hold me just like I always told you, you're gonna
[25:46.800 --> 26:00.200]  miss me when I'm gone, nobody here will ever find me, but I will always be around, just
[26:00.200 --> 26:20.440]  like the songs I leave behind me, I'm gonna live forever now, you fathers and you mothers,
[26:20.440 --> 26:28.640]  be good to one another, please try to raise your children, don't let the darkness take
[26:28.640 --> 26:36.760]  them, don't make them feel forsaken, just lead them safely to the light, when this whole
[26:36.760 --> 26:47.720]  world is blown asunder and all the stars fall from the sky, remember someone really loves
[26:47.720 --> 26:58.840]  you, we'll live forever, you and I, I'm gonna live forever, I'm gonna cross that river,
[26:58.840 --> 27:18.720]  I'm gonna catch tomorrow now, I'm gonna live forever, I'm gonna cross that river, I'm gonna
[27:18.720 --> 27:36.000]  catch tomorrow now, I'm gonna live forever, I'm gonna cross that river, I'm gonna catch
[27:36.000 --> 27:57.400]  tomorrow now, Friday emergency broadcast, Biden has officially put the U.S. under martial
[27:57.400 --> 28:02.920]  law, the federal government has been completely captured by agents of the Great Reset, by
[28:02.920 --> 28:08.280]  agents of the Bilderberg group, and now they're making their biomedical move to sterilize,
[28:08.280 --> 28:14.720]  poison and kill large swaths of the population, and of course, those of us in opposition to
[28:14.720 --> 28:20.680]  this are gonna be hunted down and killed, and the people helping carry all this out
[28:20.680 --> 28:27.280]  will be destroyed as well by their masters, not by us, this is judgment, this is doomsday
[28:27.280 --> 28:35.680]  for freedom, unless we get a reprieve like Nineveh, unless we wake up to this nightmare
[28:35.680 --> 28:41.360]  and decide to not be evil anymore, and to face the fact that they tell us all day the
[28:41.360 --> 28:45.440]  white people are bad, or the black people are bad, or the Christians are bad, or this
[28:45.440 --> 28:52.320]  group's bad, that group's bad, but never the Democrats, they tell us the veterans are bad,
[28:52.320 --> 28:59.600]  the police are bad, but never the people at the top, right, they're the good guys, right?
[28:59.600 --> 29:05.880]  Christmas 2021 is gone, it's in the rearview mirror, but you can still take advantage of

[31:58.880 --> 32:05.640]  In late August, InfoWars saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands
[32:05.640 --> 32:11.120]  that the globalists are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause
[32:11.120 --> 32:15.120]  an economic and financial collapse worldwide.
[32:15.120 --> 32:18.360]  Now ladies and gentlemen, storeable food has always been something that's important to

[33:01.840 --> 33:21.680]  Leading of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:21.680 --> 33:39.640]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:39.640 --> 33:46.520]  Here we are, ladies and gentlemen, one of the crew gave me an amazing, amazing Ephesians
[33:46.520 --> 33:55.080]  Bible quotes, so true, and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but
[33:55.080 --> 34:01.400]  rather expose them, for it is shameful even to speak of those things which are done by
[34:01.400 --> 34:08.320]  them in secret, but all things that are exposed are made manifest by the light, for whatever
[34:08.320 --> 34:18.040]  makes manifest is light, therefore he says, awake you who sleep arise from the dead and
[34:18.040 --> 34:29.320]  Christ will give you light, powerful truth, inspired by the big guy, not Donald Trump,
[34:29.320 --> 34:31.600]  the big guy.
[34:31.600 --> 34:39.640]  So I want to show TV viewers this, maybe we can put it on screen in there, look at this
[34:39.640 --> 34:43.240]  logo, this is happening all over the country, so convicted pedophiles coming and having
[34:43.240 --> 34:47.000]  your five-year-old son on their lap, sometimes unannounced in places like Denver, that's
[34:47.000 --> 34:51.240]  not bad enough, but zoom in on this or maybe put it up from InfoWars, you can see there
[34:51.240 --> 35:03.360]  is the Satanic Temple After School Satan Club, and it's a friendly, happy little Satan,
[35:03.360 --> 35:10.520]  and it's even got the messed up, lazy eye like the head of it, and he's going to teach
[35:10.520 --> 35:19.560]  you how to be avant-garde, and he's going to teach you God doesn't exist, that Satanism
[35:19.560 --> 35:26.560]  is not really about hurting children, they just want to have a relationship with children.
[35:26.560 --> 35:33.560]  Let me read to you from Ephesians again, I'm going to play the Tucker Carlson clip next
[35:33.560 --> 35:41.720]  segment, the fruitless works of darkness, you know, I mean the truth is there's side
[35:41.720 --> 35:46.680]  effects and problems, but they've been testing for 20 years MRNA stuff, and I mean it like
[35:46.680 --> 35:52.040]  cures cancer and stuff, problem is 3, 4, 5% of the time it liquefies your liver, they're
[35:52.040 --> 35:56.680]  not really sure why, but your body just goes what the hell is this, but yeah, they've got
[35:56.680 --> 36:05.280]  the fountain of youth, but if you drink from the wrong cup, just like in the third installment
[36:05.280 --> 36:12.200]  of Indiana Jones, it was so cheesy, but you pick the wrong cup, it gives you death, I
[36:12.200 --> 36:16.720]  mean this is God like power, and they don't know how it works, that's why they want to
[36:16.720 --> 36:20.600]  test it all on us, this isn't just vaccines you're being given, you're being tracked,
[36:20.600 --> 36:25.080]  you're being traced, that's why it's done with your name and number, and it big injection
[36:25.080 --> 36:29.600]  facilities run by the military and by big giant groups that really aren't even private
[36:29.600 --> 36:33.000]  companies like Wal-Mart and others, because you're being put in a database, you're being
[36:33.000 --> 36:41.800]  given specific injections, you're being tracked, you're being given all sorts of mutagens and
[36:41.800 --> 36:46.760]  by the way this came out in, what was it Lithuania last week, they had their chief medical officer
[36:46.760 --> 36:53.640]  of the country, and then some of the adjuncts came out as well, and they said listen, we've
[36:53.640 --> 36:58.520]  gotten the batches these come in, whether we're supposed to put it in a computer, and
[36:58.520 --> 37:04.320]  one is saline, one is the vaccine that's bad enough, and one says mutinogenic, they're
[37:04.320 --> 37:13.720]  giving you mutant shots to see what it does, and we know with Pfizer it's immortal cell
[37:13.720 --> 37:18.640]  line stuff, and if you know what immortal cell lines are, it's super cancer, like Superman
[37:18.640 --> 37:25.200]  isn't real, Krypton's not real, but this is real, you can put immortal cell lines in a
[37:25.200 --> 37:29.400]  pantry dish and come back five years later, it's still alive with no food, you gotta burn
[37:29.400 --> 37:35.240]  it to kill it, especially a vampire, and they'll divide forever, they never die, the telomeres
[37:35.240 --> 37:41.240]  don't ever go away, and they claim they found five people worldwide that had this, but it's
[37:41.240 --> 37:44.840]  more than that, that's why they take blood at birth from babies, and oh we're sending
[37:44.840 --> 37:50.440]  it for a blood test to make sure your child doesn't have a deficiency in vitamin K, we
[37:50.440 --> 37:59.240]  first broke it from a nurse at the big research facility at San Antonio, Fort San Houston,
[37:59.240 --> 38:02.680]  and she gave us the documents, she broke a bunch of lawsuits that came out in the news
[38:02.680 --> 38:11.600]  after that in Texas and Minnesota, that they were doing all of this, and that they were
[38:11.600 --> 38:16.480]  keeping the baby's blood in a Pentagon database, and doing all sorts of other stuff, but the
[38:16.480 --> 38:23.480]  point is that's incredibly valuable, because they get those blood samples, because it can
[38:23.480 --> 38:27.560]  be white people, Hispanics, blacks, anybody can have this, but it's like one of the rarest
[38:27.560 --> 38:33.040]  things in the universe, okay, and then they get those cells, and they go culture them
[38:33.040 --> 38:36.880]  at a giant Manhattan project level thing, you know, this has got to be a hundred times
[38:36.880 --> 38:40.040]  bigger than a Manhattan project, I mean, just this project of testing all the blood of all
[38:40.040 --> 38:44.200]  the babies born is just gigantic, and they go and they test it, and they see, did we
[38:44.200 --> 38:54.120]  get another immortal, and this isn't a Netflix show folks, this is real immortal cells, okay,
[38:54.120 --> 39:04.200]  I went and had a full genetic background done, and I don't have any immortal cells, but I've
[39:04.200 --> 39:10.640]  got 100% capacity mitochondria, which is one in 50 million they estimate, that's why I'm
[39:10.640 --> 39:14.600]  always hot, that's why I can be in freezing cold, doesn't really make me cold, I have
[39:14.600 --> 39:21.600]  100% functioning mitochondria, but then I have another mutation that blocks the absorption
[39:21.600 --> 39:27.040]  of energy, so I have maximum energy and they can't absorb energy, but whatever I get has
[39:27.040 --> 39:34.280]  maximum energy, which you can see in the physical manifestation of my body, of my earth suit,
[39:34.280 --> 39:40.080]  of what I do, everything is an example of extreme energy, that's the cells, not just
[39:40.080 --> 39:48.880]  this whole body, this whole body is my cells, and this whole thing is an engine designed
[39:48.880 --> 39:53.880]  for surviving in almost zero energy environments, and folks all of you have spectacular things
[39:53.880 --> 40:00.040]  about you, these aren't diseases, these aren't bad things in your DNA, you are the components
[40:00.040 --> 40:06.640]  of all of us cell early in a composite hive colony creature that has independent free
[40:06.640 --> 40:14.600]  will but is one colony, we are one colony, and we all have gifts in our genetics that
[40:14.600 --> 40:20.640]  can manifest in toxic environments to kill us early, but you take out the toxin, yeah
[40:20.640 --> 40:23.840]  you're predisposed to lung cancer, and if you get around things that trigger that you
[40:23.840 --> 40:26.760]  get lung cancer quicker, but it doesn't mean, it's like some people are predeposed to be
[40:26.760 --> 40:33.120]  able to lift more weight, or kick more ass, or be sweeter, or be whatever, it's all genetic
[40:33.120 --> 40:37.480]  and it's all the code God gave you through all your ancestors, so we consider and talk
[40:37.480 --> 40:42.720]  about the new world order and the Satanism all day, they're jokes ladies and gentlemen,
[40:42.720 --> 40:47.120]  they don't have any connection to download any of these big truths, and they're just
[40:47.120 --> 40:51.200]  pissed off that they're not part of the party, so they want to blow it all up and kill it,
[40:51.200 --> 40:55.480]  because they're inferior, that's why they always tell you you're inferior, and you're
[40:55.480 --> 41:00.480]  failed, and you're a genetic monster, and you're this, and you're that, because they
[41:00.480 --> 41:09.520]  are angry that for whatever reason they pulled the shortest straw, they're mad at God for
[41:09.520 --> 41:15.680]  look what you did to me, look what you made, hey sorry, for whatever reason that's part
[41:15.680 --> 41:21.000]  of God's plan, and that's why you are a glow-in-the-dark Satanist, and I don't even hate you, I just
[41:21.000 --> 41:27.400]  want away from you, whatever spiritual decisions you made, whatever your ancestors did, whatever
[41:27.400 --> 41:33.720]  it is about you, you ate the cheese, you went to the mousetrap of Satan, and you decided
[41:33.720 --> 41:37.480]  to get up there on the platform, and thought you were a winner, and you got clack, your
[41:37.480 --> 41:41.440]  neck broken, and now as you're sitting there with your neck broken, Satan comes in and
[41:41.440 --> 41:48.480]  says, help me kill other baby mice, and I'll fix your neck, and you go, sure, fix my neck,
[41:48.480 --> 41:52.080]  but you don't really fix your neck, does it, your head's all cock-eyed, you're like walking
[41:52.080 --> 41:54.920]  around, crapping on yourself, I mean you're not, you're not really who you were, were
[41:54.920 --> 41:58.760]  you, and so these are the mysteries of God, and it's the one argument the Satanists have
[41:58.760 --> 42:04.360]  is, which I don't agree with, why would a God do stuff like this, well because God's
[42:04.360 --> 42:09.560]  only, I mean what else can God do but create new entities that have free will, and you
[42:09.560 --> 42:14.720]  know, I've got four children, they're great, they do some bad things, I get pissed at them,
[42:14.720 --> 42:20.520]  and none of my children have turned to Satan, thank the Lord, but I had them, I had children
[42:20.520 --> 42:24.680]  knowing they could turn to Satan, I had children knowing I'm giving them death, giving them
[42:24.680 --> 42:28.760]  life is giving them death, when you have a child, you kill a child, you are bringing
[42:28.760 --> 42:33.480]  in somebody, that's a big ritual, isn't it, and these Satanists want you to just decide,
[42:33.480 --> 42:37.560]  oh that's crap, none of that matters, just be into yourself as if that's going to build
[42:37.560 --> 42:43.640]  a good world, some self-centered idiot running around in a black outfit trying to act powerful,
[42:43.640 --> 42:50.960]  these Satanists have no idea about power, ridiculous, have you ever even saw the edge
[42:50.960 --> 42:55.520]  of God, you've never come back, but you're not meant to see it, that's why you will not

[44:24.600 --> 44:28.320]  Notice first they called it global freezing back in the 70s and 80s, and then it's going
[44:28.320 --> 44:31.560]  to be global warming and when that didn't really happen the way they wanted it to, okay
[44:31.560 --> 44:36.600]  now it's just climate change, but did you know that manmade climate change is a real
[44:36.600 --> 44:42.000]  thing when it comes to the United Nations and the Department of Energy and Bill Gates
[44:42.000 --> 44:43.000]  and the UN?
[44:43.000 --> 44:48.200]  They have weather control treaties from 1979, and Bill Gates has been manipulating the weather
[44:48.200 --> 44:52.840]  for a very long time, in fact back in 1994, two scientists wanted a Nobel Prize for an
[44:52.840 --> 44:56.800]  idea of spraying different particles out of jet engines to control the weather, so yes
[44:56.800 --> 44:59.640]  manmade climate change is real.
[44:59.640 --> 45:04.680]  We here at InfoWars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava root supplement that
[45:04.680 --> 45:10.520]  is now available at infowarstore.com, Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in
[45:10.520 --> 45:14.520]  the natural health world today, though it has been used for hundreds of years in the
[45:14.520 --> 45:18.600]  Pacific Islands for its relaxation and euphoric effects.
[45:18.600 --> 45:24.360]  According to ancient Samoan legend Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa, who
[45:24.360 --> 45:28.640]  they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[45:28.640 --> 45:33.320]  The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to
[45:33.320 --> 45:34.600]  loosen up a little.
[45:34.600 --> 45:39.440]  Nowadays Kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[45:39.440 --> 45:45.440]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only Kava Kava, but other
[45:45.440 --> 45:48.320]  herbs including but not limited to.
[45:48.320 --> 45:52.120]  And Kava Milk, Organic Skull Cap, and Valerian root.

[47:01.000 --> 47:27.400]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:27.400 --> 47:34.400]  We're going to be white-hot forever, total completion, timelessness, we're going to be
[47:34.400 --> 47:38.400]  white-hot forever, white-hot forever.
[47:38.400 --> 48:06.400]  We're going to be white-hot forever, total completion, timelessness, we're going to be white-hot forever.
[48:06.400 --> 48:14.400]  All right, I went into preacher mode, because that's what I do.
[48:14.400 --> 48:18.000]  I go over my brain set, my soul set.
[48:18.000 --> 48:23.040]  But next hour, I am going to not go into preacher mode, I'm going to go into analyst mode about
[48:23.040 --> 48:24.040]  where we are.
[48:24.040 --> 48:29.160]  But I don't think you really need me to tell you what's about to go down, do you?
[48:29.160 --> 48:33.160]  It's the best of times, the worst of times, as they said, the total two cities.
[48:33.160 --> 48:36.680]  Because there's a global awakening, because we're rejecting the Satanist, because we're
[48:36.680 --> 48:42.720]  rejecting their tyranny, they are going to stage terror attacks all over the world, not
[48:42.720 --> 48:48.440]  just here, and they're going to blame it on anti-vax opposition.
[48:48.440 --> 48:52.640]  And they're going to also stage attacks on the government, on the people that have occupied
[48:52.640 --> 48:57.800]  the government to make themselves victims, and claim that supporters of President Trump
[48:57.800 --> 49:03.040]  have done it to then demonize and shut down Trump so he doesn't run again.
[49:03.040 --> 49:06.160]  And that's the plan.
[49:06.160 --> 49:14.520]  And what freaks me out is this, I've been reading the federal filings that the FBI and
[49:14.520 --> 49:22.440]  the Justice Department put in, in these cases of the 700-plus people in jail.
[49:22.440 --> 49:27.600]  And personally, with Owen Schreuer, I was there, I know what happened, and what they
[49:27.600 --> 49:31.520]  said about him is just, I mean, it's like a comic book.
[49:31.520 --> 49:34.480]  It's an act of fiction.
[49:34.480 --> 49:42.320]  And again, it's not just about Owen or me, it's about why would you criminally file in
[49:42.320 --> 49:45.280]  court stuff that is easily disproven?
[49:45.280 --> 49:49.020]  And the answer is they want us to know.
[49:49.020 --> 49:57.240]  We own the judges, and we own everything, and, I mean, Tucker Carlson had a guest on
[49:57.240 --> 50:02.600]  who, again, was a commander in the Navy, so some oathkeeper sent him a text once saying,
[50:02.600 --> 50:04.240]  hey, commander, how are you doing?
[50:04.240 --> 50:08.680]  So they claimed he was there with a boat to attack and cross the Potomac, and he wasn't
[50:08.680 --> 50:12.200]  on the Potomac, didn't have a boat, wasn't in the Capitol, it doesn't matter, and he
[50:12.200 --> 50:16.360]  goes to them and says, hey, I wasn't even there, and they go, we don't care, we're doubling
[50:16.360 --> 50:19.360]  down.
[50:19.360 --> 50:21.840]  They're not just doing it because they were proven wrong, and now they're going to double
[50:21.840 --> 50:22.840]  down.
[50:22.840 --> 50:24.640]  They did it on purpose.
[50:24.640 --> 50:29.480]  If they can kill kids with poison shots and have people go along with that, if they can
[50:29.480 --> 50:35.120]  set up seven-year-old disabled veterans who did nothing, and lie to courts, I mean, they
[50:35.120 --> 50:39.720]  say in the federal filings against Owen, we've shown them on air, that Owen entered and attacked
[50:39.720 --> 50:44.800]  the Capitol, and that Owen does not work for Info Wars, and that Owen was not with us in
[50:44.800 --> 50:45.800]  our security.
[50:45.800 --> 50:49.240]  Because he argued back in his filing, hey, please drop this, Judge, I didn't go into
[50:49.240 --> 50:53.000]  Capitol, and I was with Alex Jones, and I was with his security people, and I worked
[50:53.000 --> 50:57.520]  for Info Wars, and here's a video of me trying to get people to outside to not go in the
[50:57.520 --> 50:58.520]  building.
[50:58.520 --> 51:04.920]  Something the police wouldn't even do, they're just standing there, they're going in.
[51:04.920 --> 51:07.760]  And they filed and said, Owen Schreuer is a liar.
[51:07.760 --> 51:09.560]  They said he's guilty of perjury.
[51:09.560 --> 51:13.760]  He went in the Capitol, and he does not work for Info Wars.
[51:13.760 --> 51:22.000]  It says this, and he was not with Alex Jones that day, he's on hours of footage, and we
[51:22.000 --> 51:31.560]  gave them the, we gave the court his exhibits, the cameras that our security wore, the body
[51:31.560 --> 51:39.520]  cams, and the judge just goes, well, you are the government, so I'm just going to believe
[51:39.520 --> 51:44.560]  this, sorry, the charges go forward, we're like, it's not true.
[51:44.560 --> 51:49.400]  The judge goes, I'm not looking, it's the government.
[51:49.400 --> 51:55.400]  That is a message, ladies and gentlemen, that we will do anything we want to you, and there's
[51:55.400 --> 51:58.920]  nothing you're going to do about it.
[51:58.920 --> 52:05.400]  Hey, message received, and you're having pedophile time at the schools, and Satan hour now too.
[52:05.400 --> 52:09.200]  We, we, oh, we definitely get it.
[52:09.200 --> 52:11.040]  And why are they doing this?
[52:11.040 --> 52:14.680]  Because they're behavioral psychologists that never get in trouble, that have got with anything,
[52:14.680 --> 52:17.240]  and they sit around and they go, how do we make them blow stuff up?
[52:17.240 --> 52:18.480]  How do we make them rebel?
[52:18.480 --> 52:19.840]  How do we make them go crazy?
[52:19.840 --> 52:22.360]  Well, let's have Satan time now at school.
[52:22.360 --> 52:23.800]  They won't do drag-gling story time.
[52:23.800 --> 52:24.960]  How about Satan time?
[52:24.960 --> 52:29.960]  Or how about we totally implode the border and do, I mean, it just goes on and on, trying
[52:29.960 --> 52:38.760]  to get us to uprise because that will collapse the country.
[52:38.760 --> 52:43.600]  And this is a multinational plan to end America and the Western world as we know it, because
[52:43.600 --> 52:48.160]  everybody aspired to be a Westerner and to have a house and a car and to go to college
[52:48.160 --> 52:52.800]  and to be free and the Christian ethos and love everybody, true liberalism.
[52:52.800 --> 52:56.520]  That's all got to go under the New World Order.
[52:56.520 --> 52:58.320]  That's why they have sold in target.
[52:58.320 --> 53:02.320]  I heard about this last year, but I was in target, went to the book, it was there.
[53:02.320 --> 53:07.640]  They had a bunch of pedophile books and a bunch of how to summon demons and how to kill
[53:07.640 --> 53:10.880]  your parents and they don't do what you want.
[53:10.880 --> 53:16.080]  This is just how to scramble children's brains, and that's sold in target.
[53:16.080 --> 53:20.360]  Being six to 10 year olds, how to summon demons?
[53:20.360 --> 53:27.120]  I'll tell you how to summon a demon, turn on the television, look at Nancy Pelosi.
[53:27.120 --> 53:33.800]  So this is it, ladies and gentlemen, this is the big one.
[53:33.800 --> 53:38.120]  And I'll get to it at the start of the next hour, this, this Tucker Carlson piece, which
[53:38.120 --> 53:41.640]  he illustrates so well, but it's on record that the Justice Department, he focuses on
[53:41.640 --> 53:45.600]  one school district, but the Justice Department sent out letters all over and the White House
[53:45.600 --> 53:47.760]  did, saying, oh, tell us they're terrorists.
[53:47.760 --> 53:50.920]  We want you to call them terrorists, because you know, the Justice Department doesn't want
[53:50.920 --> 53:55.800]  to come out itself and say, hey, our new enemies, parents that don't want Satan now or a pedophile
[53:55.800 --> 54:02.840]  hour or critical race theory at your whites are inherently evil, just garbage, beyond
[54:02.840 --> 54:03.840]  garbage.
[54:03.840 --> 54:05.920]  That'd be the worst stuff.
[54:05.920 --> 54:10.600]  And then we want you to call for the FBI to go after the school boards.
[54:10.600 --> 54:14.120]  You think that just sounds like a way to turn people against them?
[54:14.120 --> 54:19.400]  If we'll accept drag queen, pedophile storytime, and if we'll accept Satan time and conjuring
[54:19.400 --> 54:24.000]  demons with the local Satan priests comes with your children, if you'll accept all of
[54:24.000 --> 54:30.080]  this, then you'll accept the power being turned off, you'll accept the inflation, you'll accept
[54:30.080 --> 54:34.800]  it all, because if they can get you to go against God and go against children, everything
[54:34.800 --> 54:37.880]  else follows.
[54:37.880 --> 54:44.400]  They just need you to go against God, and then they've got you.
[54:44.400 --> 54:50.680]  You know, the allegory of Pinocchio, and he's not really a real boy, it's an allegory of
[54:50.680 --> 54:55.120]  humans, like we could be with God, we could be next level, we are creating the image of
[54:55.120 --> 55:01.400]  God, we can literally ascend and be with God, but we're wooden right now.
[55:01.400 --> 55:07.800]  We're here in the third dimension, love built us, you know, Gepetto, and you know, the cat
[55:07.800 --> 55:14.400]  and all the rest of them, they want a son, they want a brother, they want a friend, and
[55:14.400 --> 55:18.320]  so it's true, you don't just have children by having children, you have children by loving
[55:18.320 --> 55:22.880]  all children, helping all children, and so Pinocchio goes and gets picked up by thugs
[55:22.880 --> 55:30.840]  and they run a scam on him, and then he gets sold into slavery with the local gypsy, you
[55:30.840 --> 55:35.200]  know, there of the wooden boy that could dance, and then he gets away again, and the same
[55:35.200 --> 55:39.000]  scammers show up, the same cool delinquent kids, and they go, hey, let's go out here
[55:39.000 --> 55:44.120]  and break bottles and play pool and gamble and fight, you know, an allegory of street
[55:44.120 --> 55:51.160]  thuggery and gangs, and then you turn into a jackass, a slave, to be put on a ship and
[55:51.160 --> 55:58.200]  to be sold to a coal mine.
[55:58.200 --> 56:02.800]  And what are they telling you in Disney, it's the state, it's the system that wants you
[56:02.800 --> 56:06.680]  to be a criminal, they want you to go out and not be legitimate and build your own family
[56:06.680 --> 56:10.760]  and system, they want to set you up looking for father figures by taking your mothers
[56:10.760 --> 56:15.800]  away when you're little, taking your fathers away when you're little, and having the TV
[56:15.800 --> 56:19.400]  and the culture raise you, so you're looking for that father figure, and the father figure
[56:19.400 --> 56:24.360]  is like, yeah, come on in, let's have fun, let's break things, let's steal, let's learn
[56:24.360 --> 56:29.440]  how to rob, let's be criminals, and now your humanity's over, you're turned into an animal
[56:29.440 --> 56:35.360]  and you're loaded on a slave ship to be taken to an offshore coal mine.
[56:35.360 --> 56:44.240]  So a film from 70 years ago is the allegory of everything we're dealing with now, and
[56:44.240 --> 56:51.280]  now the literal Satanists are in your school in their clown outfits, hit the clown, I'm
[56:51.280 --> 56:56.800]  here, the kid's totally creeped out and scared, look at him, learning to be touched and having
[56:56.800 --> 57:01.520]  first event horizon with something this dangerous, because if we couldn't kill you before you
[57:01.520 --> 57:08.720]  were born, now we're going to fetishize ruining who you are now that you live here, and then
[57:08.720 --> 57:17.200]  inducting you into this satanic slavery, now go to the part in Pinocchio where they turn
[57:17.200 --> 57:23.360]  into donkeys, so that's what this all is, and it's fitting the Democrats for the party
[57:23.360 --> 57:29.600]  of the donkeys, I saw a t-shirt just today at a gas station, and they said, I've not
[57:29.600 --> 57:35.120]  seen the Democrats this angry, it's Abe Lincoln saying it, since we took their slaves away,
[57:35.120 --> 57:41.880]  seriously folks, they want slaves, and children make good slaves, it's very, very simple,
[57:41.880 --> 57:50.320]  we'll be right back with our number two, infowars.com, share that link.

[59:44.800 --> 59:51.560]  amazing.
[59:51.560 --> 1:00:04.680]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:04.680 --> 1:00:08.640]  So you want to know why Bill Gates is so happy?
[1:00:08.640 --> 1:00:15.720]  He's one of the biggest eugenicists in history, folks, I think it's a fair estimate to say
[1:00:15.720 --> 1:00:19.680]  he is tens of billions worldwide for eugenics, he's probably got more mega deaths under his
[1:00:19.680 --> 1:00:37.160]  belt than Adolf Alois Hitler, I don't think he has Mao championed yet, but he'll get there.
[1:00:37.160 --> 1:00:42.960]  It's hard for me to understand that there are hundreds of thousands of people conservatively,
[1:00:42.960 --> 1:00:52.320]  sociologists and psychologists and criminologists predict, bare minimum in the world, hundreds
[1:00:52.320 --> 1:00:57.240]  of thousands, probably more, that enjoy kidnapping little children and torturing them to death
[1:00:57.240 --> 1:01:04.880]  for weeks and then killing them.
[1:01:04.880 --> 1:01:15.240]  That is hard for me to imagine that there are people who enjoy torturing innocent people
[1:01:15.240 --> 1:01:20.000]  to death.
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:27.920]  But just because that is 180 degrees alien from what most of us believe in, in what most
[1:01:27.920 --> 1:01:36.240]  of us love and what most of us like and what most of our tastes are, nevertheless those
[1:01:36.240 --> 1:01:43.800]  individuals are amongst us.
[1:01:43.800 --> 1:01:48.560]  And there's different debates on it, different psychological reports that have been done
[1:01:48.560 --> 1:01:55.640]  on it, some quackery, some quite accurate, some estimates as many as two psychopaths
[1:01:55.640 --> 1:01:59.920]  for every hundred people.
[1:01:59.920 --> 1:02:04.920]  Most of the studies show on average about one psychopath per every hundred people.
[1:02:04.920 --> 1:02:10.880]  And guess how many sociopaths there are for every hundred?
[1:02:10.880 --> 1:02:19.280]  Some gauges have 20% being sociopaths, that is they don't enjoy killing you, they just
[1:02:19.280 --> 1:02:20.280]  don't care if you die.
[1:02:20.280 --> 1:02:36.040]  See a psychopath enjoys it and enjoys the power trip of it.
[1:02:36.040 --> 1:02:44.200]  And so what you had is psychopaths, high functioning psychopaths in command of legions
[1:02:44.200 --> 1:02:47.760]  of sociopaths.
[1:02:47.760 --> 1:02:56.120]  The psychopaths also command legions of people that like to be enslaved and people that like
[1:02:56.120 --> 1:03:00.080]  to serve psychopaths, the whip me, beat me types.
[1:03:00.080 --> 1:03:07.000]  Like many of their most dangerous operatives are the chicken neck ghoul variety that I
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:14.640]  so love.
[1:03:14.640 --> 1:03:22.520]  And then of course they have the sadistic sadist, they have armies of them and they
[1:03:22.520 --> 1:03:35.040]  operate the virus of tyranny operates best in a fat and decadent
[1:03:35.040 --> 1:03:38.360]  spoiled environment.
[1:03:38.360 --> 1:03:43.480]  And boy in America, the epitome of that fat, dumb and happy.
[1:03:43.480 --> 1:03:48.720]  It's like rotten stagnant water that you've pumped a thousand gallons of fresh sewage
[1:03:48.720 --> 1:03:49.720]  into.
[1:03:49.720 --> 1:04:04.320]  Oh, it's already full of bacteria and filth, but it's going to become pure cess sludge.
[1:04:04.320 --> 1:04:11.560]  Pure detritus, liquid E. coli, liquid death.
[1:04:11.560 --> 1:04:18.000]  Only the new world order would come up with an artificial sweetener that rots holes in
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:24.920]  your brains, kills your cells in mass, attacks every organ, attacks your pancreas, and is
[1:04:24.920 --> 1:04:32.280]  the defecation of genetically engineered E. coli bacteria.
[1:04:32.280 --> 1:04:34.240]  Only the new world order would come up with that.
[1:04:34.240 --> 1:04:37.880]  That's just a few minutes from a clip.
[1:04:37.880 --> 1:04:42.160]  It's now at Band-Aid video, Alex Jones exposes Bill Gates as the psycho depopulation king.
[1:04:42.160 --> 1:04:46.560]  We're going to come back and get to unbelievable news.
[1:04:46.560 --> 1:04:51.960]  I told you this yesterday and it's happened.
[1:04:51.960 --> 1:04:57.080]  The Democrats, Biden has now announced the plan to end the Republican Party officially.
[1:04:57.080 --> 1:04:59.160]  Told you.
[1:04:59.160 --> 1:05:04.000]  Everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has only been the buildup for what
[1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:06.000]  the globalists are doing right now.
[1:05:06.000 --> 1:05:10.120]  This is their big offensive, this is their takeover, and this is the point that they're
[1:05:10.120 --> 1:05:13.120]  at their very weakest because now they've revealed themselves.
[1:05:13.120 --> 1:05:17.160]  Now their world government, their permanent martial law, their medical tyranny is out
[1:05:17.160 --> 1:05:18.160]  in the open.
[1:05:18.160 --> 1:05:22.680]  Their depopulation agenda has been exposed, but they're using their corporate power and
[1:05:22.680 --> 1:05:26.920]  trillions to go across the planet and shut down people telling the truth.
[1:05:26.920 --> 1:05:30.200]  So listen, Paul Revere's, when you spread the word about the broadcast, when you pray
[1:05:30.200 --> 1:05:34.880]  for the broadcast, you're the tip of the spear, and when you buy products at infowarstore.com,
[1:05:34.880 --> 1:05:36.120]  you keep us on air.

[1:05:45.160 --> 1:05:49.000]  They are so good for your body, and if there's two things you do for your body, it's these
[1:05:49.000 --> 1:05:50.000]  two products.
[1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:54.600]  They're all back in stock at infowarstore.com, 50% off, and it keeps us on the air.
[1:05:54.600 --> 1:06:05.440]  The way we fail is if you don't take action.
[1:06:05.440 --> 1:06:17.440]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[1:06:17.440 --> 1:06:33.720]  Here we are, ladies and gentlemen, Biden says he has no idea, we got the clip, he has no
[1:06:33.720 --> 1:06:39.000]  idea if there will be a Republican Party in 2024.
[1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:40.560]  Wow.
[1:06:40.560 --> 1:06:45.480]  What was in yesterday's show headline, the sub-headline, Democrats plan to outlaw the
[1:06:45.480 --> 1:06:50.760]  Republican Party before 2024, and you're like, how do they do that?
[1:06:50.760 --> 1:06:55.720]  Well, they've announced the CIA and the Pentagon, and it's all official, are going to take on
[1:06:55.720 --> 1:06:59.640]  Trump supporters and Republicans, and even Ms. McConnell came out two days ago and said
[1:06:59.640 --> 1:07:07.360]  I've never heard of a president saying the opposition party are terrorists.
[1:07:07.360 --> 1:07:08.360]  What did I just say?
[1:07:08.360 --> 1:07:12.640]  The end of American Republicans here, Dems announced new terrorism plan that outlaws all
[1:07:12.640 --> 1:07:14.960]  opposition, creates one party state.
[1:07:14.960 --> 1:07:16.280]  That's today's headline.
[1:07:16.280 --> 1:07:18.080]  I didn't know he said this last night.
[1:07:18.080 --> 1:07:23.360]  I just learned about this, oh, that is your state's headline, so this is before he said
[1:07:23.360 --> 1:07:24.360]  it.
[1:07:24.360 --> 1:07:27.120]  The end of the American Republicans here, Dems announced new terrorism plan that outlaws
[1:07:27.120 --> 1:07:31.000]  all opposition, creates one party state, and I went on to say on the show as you heard
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:39.080]  a bunch that they're going to ban the Republican Party by saying it's a terror party, and that's
[1:07:39.080 --> 1:07:40.920]  what Ms. McConnell talked about.
[1:07:40.920 --> 1:07:46.280]  Exactly, we need to get the men and women of this country that don't want to live in
[1:07:46.280 --> 1:07:52.960]  total slavery to understand that this is the takeover.
[1:07:52.960 --> 1:07:54.720]  The Democrats know they've lost control.
[1:07:54.720 --> 1:07:56.480]  They know they don't control blue states.
[1:07:56.480 --> 1:08:00.200]  Those are really Republican states, and again, I'm not saying Republicans are perfect, just
[1:08:00.200 --> 1:08:06.000]  the Democrats are the party of the end of the nation, and so they've lost.
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  It's over for them.
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:13.520]  Here's the Terminator analogy, 1980s movie, great plot, great movie.
[1:08:13.520 --> 1:08:18.760]  James Cameron, who's the depopulationist globalist, by the way, but that's a side
[1:08:18.760 --> 1:08:20.360]  issue.
[1:08:20.360 --> 1:08:24.640]  What does he say?
[1:08:24.640 --> 1:08:27.080]  What do you write in Terminator?
[1:08:27.080 --> 1:08:29.160]  Sky Nets lost.
[1:08:29.160 --> 1:08:32.920]  Humans had taken back over and blown up the central command of the machines.
[1:08:32.920 --> 1:08:37.000]  Their only chance was to send back a Terminator to kill the leader of the resistance, John
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:41.160]  Connor, in the past, and that's literally where they're at right now.
[1:08:41.160 --> 1:08:42.520]  No one wants the New World Order.
[1:08:42.520 --> 1:08:43.640]  No one wants Bill Gates.
[1:08:43.640 --> 1:08:45.360]  No one wants Klaus Schwab.
[1:08:45.360 --> 1:08:48.160]  Nobody wants David Rockefeller's program.
[1:08:48.160 --> 1:08:49.920]  Nobody wants drag queen story time.
[1:08:49.920 --> 1:08:50.920]  Nobody wants Satan time.
[1:08:50.920 --> 1:08:52.920]  They're not having schools across the country.
[1:08:52.920 --> 1:08:53.920]  No one wants this.
[1:08:53.920 --> 1:08:55.400]  We don't like it.
[1:08:55.400 --> 1:08:56.400]  We don't like 5G.
[1:08:56.400 --> 1:08:57.400]  We don't like GMO.
[1:08:57.400 --> 1:08:58.400]  We don't like the New World Order.
[1:08:58.400 --> 1:09:05.280]  And so their answer is, oh, really, we'll just start a civil war that we run ourselves
[1:09:05.280 --> 1:09:08.040]  and blow everything up and turn the power off.
[1:09:08.040 --> 1:09:13.240]  Oh, the cyber terrorists are about to turn everybody's power off, and within a month
[1:09:13.240 --> 1:09:14.840]  most people will die.
[1:09:14.840 --> 1:09:17.040]  Oh, gee, better let us run things.
[1:09:17.040 --> 1:09:19.760]  I mean, they've got a gun to our head.
[1:09:19.760 --> 1:09:22.480]  We're like a battered woman trying to leave the house.
[1:09:22.480 --> 1:09:23.480]  He's got a knife to us.
[1:09:23.480 --> 1:09:24.480]  Don't you leave.
[1:09:24.480 --> 1:09:26.920]  I'll slit your throat.
[1:09:26.920 --> 1:09:28.080]  See how that works for you.
[1:09:28.080 --> 1:09:34.520]  And this is always the threat continuum and the force continuum of corrupt establishments.
[1:09:34.520 --> 1:09:39.200]  They always take over with surveillance and authoritarianism and payoffs, and then that
[1:09:39.200 --> 1:09:40.200]  doesn't work.
[1:09:40.200 --> 1:09:43.640]  So they start oppressing, and they start killing people, and they start doing all, and it gets
[1:09:43.640 --> 1:09:44.640]  worse and worse.
[1:09:44.640 --> 1:09:46.080]  And finally they just go, just kill everybody.
[1:09:46.080 --> 1:09:47.080]  Just kill them.
[1:09:47.080 --> 1:09:48.080]  Kill them.
[1:09:48.080 --> 1:09:49.080]  Kill them.
[1:09:49.080 --> 1:09:53.200]  And that's what Zinbigno Brzezinski said a couple years before he died in a CFR meeting
[1:09:53.200 --> 1:09:54.360]  he did in Canada.
[1:09:54.360 --> 1:09:55.360]  He sat on TV.
[1:09:55.360 --> 1:09:58.560]  He said, it's cheaper just to kill everybody than convince them anymore, and we should
[1:09:58.560 --> 1:10:02.640]  do that.
[1:10:02.640 --> 1:10:04.520]  And now they're doing it.
[1:10:04.520 --> 1:10:09.240]  He had Memorandum 200 back in the White House with Henry Kissinger.
[1:10:09.240 --> 1:10:11.480]  He continued Memorandum 200.
[1:10:11.480 --> 1:10:12.480]  State Department Memorandum 200.
[1:10:12.480 --> 1:10:15.600]  Just, by the way, anything I say, you just look up, you know.
[1:10:15.600 --> 1:10:19.480]  But I'd save all these documents, you know, in the future, which is now, they're basically
[1:10:19.480 --> 1:10:24.920]  taking everything down we cover so you can't go looking up for yourself.
[1:10:24.920 --> 1:10:29.640]  So they got an eye on you, not because you got something to hide, but because they don't
[1:10:29.640 --> 1:10:31.360]  want to compete with you.
[1:10:31.360 --> 1:10:32.800]  They don't want to look at you.
[1:10:32.800 --> 1:10:34.160]  They want you dead.
[1:10:34.160 --> 1:10:36.480]  That makes them feel good.
[1:10:36.480 --> 1:10:40.800]  More poisoned children, more deaths, more everything horrible, dystopia is what they
[1:10:40.800 --> 1:10:43.280]  want because they're unhappy, evil Satanists.
[1:10:43.280 --> 1:10:47.320]  They join the wrong team, and then everything that comes out of them is an extrapolation
[1:10:47.320 --> 1:10:49.440]  of that.
[1:10:49.440 --> 1:10:52.320]  So here's Tucker Carlson last night, we'll play part of it now, part of it coming up
[1:10:52.320 --> 1:10:56.720]  in Mancow is running for governor of Illinois, he's going to pop in.
[1:10:56.720 --> 1:11:01.160]  We have an oathkeeper that got out of oathkeepers right before January 6th because he saw troubling
[1:11:01.160 --> 1:11:06.120]  signs of what was going on, and the federal provocateur stuff that was happening.
[1:11:06.120 --> 1:11:09.480]  I'm not saying Stuart Rhodes is a Fed, I'm not, but clearly Fed's infiltrated, and there
[1:11:09.480 --> 1:11:15.720]  was a lot of manipulation going on, so we've got a lot of big info on that coming up next
[1:11:15.720 --> 1:11:19.840]  hour and so much more today here.
[1:11:19.840 --> 1:11:25.800]  So let's go ahead and go to the war on our children, and then I've got a big list of
[1:11:25.800 --> 1:11:34.360]  things here dealing with the new announcement of the domestic war on the American people.
[1:11:34.360 --> 1:11:38.600]  Like people like, whoa, the Cold War, you know, the Soviets are bad, but this is kind
[1:11:38.600 --> 1:11:41.720]  of a dangerous buildup of military industrial complex to counter them, it could be used
[1:11:41.720 --> 1:11:42.720]  against us.
[1:11:42.720 --> 1:11:50.880]  That was 1961 in January, outgoing president, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and now here we are
[1:11:50.880 --> 1:12:01.920]  60-plus years later, 61 years later, and it happened, oh wow, really, yeah, just like
[1:12:01.920 --> 1:12:05.320]  third world countries, you get a big giant bureaucracy and intelligence agency, they
[1:12:05.320 --> 1:12:11.400]  don't just take over, they don't just want money, they get on power trips, and remember
[1:12:11.400 --> 1:12:16.480]  a bunch of them are Satanists and pedophiles, because if you want to be a pedophile, you
[1:12:16.480 --> 1:12:21.640]  got to hire IQ, you go join things like that, where the institution isn't going to want
[1:12:21.640 --> 1:12:25.520]  to get caught doing that, and it's going to cover it up, and as soon as they cover it
[1:12:25.520 --> 1:12:29.640]  up, well now they create a safe space for the criminals, and they start hollowing things
[1:12:29.640 --> 1:12:36.960]  out, and they start taking over to the point now where again, they file court stuff against
[1:12:36.960 --> 1:12:41.880]  my co-host, Owen Schreuer, saying he attacked inside the Capitol, doesn't work for him
[1:12:41.880 --> 1:12:45.360]  for wars, they told a federal judge, he's lying, your honor, he wasn't with Alex Jones
[1:12:45.360 --> 1:12:52.760]  trying to stop it, he doesn't work there, those weren't his security, no, he's a liar.
[1:12:52.760 --> 1:12:56.280]  They know that judge is in their pocket, obviously, because you can go look that up and see it's
[1:12:56.280 --> 1:13:00.720]  a lie, we have the exhibits, the video, again, this isn't about Owen or Alex Jones, I mean
[1:13:00.720 --> 1:13:05.800]  sure, they're coming after us because we're trying to defend everybody, we're warriors,
[1:13:05.800 --> 1:13:08.960]  we're up front, we're just being men, we're like throwbacks, we're like men stood up to
[1:13:08.960 --> 1:13:14.040]  evil like whoa, this is bad, I'm supposed to do something here, and that's why we're
[1:13:14.040 --> 1:13:18.160]  virile, everybody can see it because that's what humans are, the stuff they've been doing
[1:13:18.160 --> 1:13:29.240]  to the water didn't completely work on us, so think about that, and let that sink in
[1:13:29.240 --> 1:13:33.520]  that they will put in federal filings, people that, they're even putting people in filings
[1:13:33.520 --> 1:13:37.360]  that weren't even in DC, they're putting people in filings, they said they had boats attacking
[1:13:37.360 --> 1:13:42.440]  the Potomac and they don't even have a boat and didn't work in the, they don't care, well
[1:13:42.440 --> 1:13:48.080]  that's sloppy, no it's not sloppy, they say let's commit major crimes, let's get these
[1:13:48.080 --> 1:13:52.200]  judges to sign on to stuff that's total lies and we'll have them really corrupt, just like
[1:13:52.200 --> 1:13:55.760]  let's inject children with gene therapies that give them cancer and heart attacks, and then
[1:13:55.760 --> 1:13:59.480]  instead they've learned the average person will cover up like God my kid had a heart
[1:13:59.480 --> 1:14:03.800]  attack, well I'm not going to admit I did this, oh my kid had a heart attack, it's not
[1:14:03.800 --> 1:14:11.680]  from the shotter, oh yeah, you see how they work, I mean they've got this all figured
[1:14:11.680 --> 1:14:18.800]  out except when you sell out your own species and when you screw everybody else it's like
[1:14:18.800 --> 1:14:26.720]  taking a dump in the pool, pissing in the pool is bad enough, okay, but imagine if you
[1:14:26.720 --> 1:14:32.000]  go to a public pool and people didn't just decide to piss in it, so they got to put way
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:35.320]  more chlorine in it and then it burns your eyes and there's ammonia in there and you're
[1:14:35.320 --> 1:14:43.440]  basically bathing in a urinal and people started crapping in it, well one person craps you
[1:14:43.440 --> 1:14:48.160]  get out of the pool and that's what the new world order is, they're all in the pool crapping,
[1:14:48.160 --> 1:14:55.840]  pretending like they're doing it to us, the FBI's like, ugh, and Manson Wilson's like,
[1:14:55.840 --> 1:14:59.600]  I mean seriously, and then they're like, I don't know who did that, it's like crap floating
[1:14:59.600 --> 1:15:03.880]  everywhere and it stinks and they've ruined everything and it's horrible and then we're
[1:15:03.880 --> 1:15:08.320]  like lifeguards going, don't crap in the pool and they go, arrest that terrorist, that's
[1:15:08.320 --> 1:15:14.720]  a terrorist, they don't, no one's crapping in the pool and that's the gaslighting, they
[1:15:14.720 --> 1:15:19.880]  got new articles out going, okay the Pentagon is siopping you, we did do mass formation
[1:15:19.880 --> 1:15:25.480]  psychosis for your own good, okay fine it's real, last week it wasn't real but it's real
[1:15:25.480 --> 1:15:32.840]  now, look at these articles, it's real, it's good, why don't you like it?
[1:15:32.840 --> 1:15:38.560]  I mean financial times of London, psyops are a crucial weapon in the war, it's disinformation,
[1:15:38.560 --> 1:15:42.920]  thank God major military units are creating fear in the public for their own good, but
[1:15:42.920 --> 1:15:47.200]  if you say they're doing that, it doesn't exist, now you live in double think world,
[1:15:47.200 --> 1:15:52.920]  now you're living in Winston Smith's 1984, does anybody want to live in this?
[1:15:52.920 --> 1:15:57.880]  They're pooping in the pool.

[1:20:00.160 --> 1:20:09.840]  Reading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:09.840 --> 1:20:17.880]  Alright, the full report here on the Alex Jones Show is on infowars.com, it's about
[1:20:17.880 --> 1:20:22.760]  14 minutes long, but I'm going to air in this little 9 minute segment, a lot of it.
[1:20:22.760 --> 1:20:26.480]  We now know that the White House and Justice Department, didn't just in Virginia as Tucker
[1:20:26.480 --> 1:20:31.720]  covers but other places, went out and said, hey, call them terrorists and ask us to counter
[1:20:31.720 --> 1:20:36.080]  the terrorist parents that don't want pedophiles teaching their kids or critical race theory
[1:20:36.080 --> 1:20:40.960]  that's basically like Hitler, but from the other perspective, with white people teaching
[1:20:40.960 --> 1:20:44.640]  that whites are inherently evil, I mean this is just the nastiest stuff you do to destroy
[1:20:44.640 --> 1:20:45.640]  a country.
[1:20:45.640 --> 1:20:49.440]  This is the takedown of the nation and he laid it all out last night and how it's all tied
[1:20:49.440 --> 1:20:54.240]  to the terrorism and branding Americans as the enemy and the martial law that Biden's
[1:20:54.240 --> 1:21:00.520]  really already put us under with the vaccine mandates and recording everybody that hasn't
[1:21:00.520 --> 1:21:01.520]  taken the shot.
[1:21:01.520 --> 1:21:02.520]  That's in a secret database.
[1:21:02.520 --> 1:21:06.440]  I mean, this is all camps being built for those that haven't taken the shots.
[1:21:06.440 --> 1:21:14.520]  This is the imploding empire looking at its citizens and saying, we can't loot Third World
[1:21:14.520 --> 1:21:15.520]  countries anymore.
[1:21:15.520 --> 1:21:16.520]  We'll just loot them.
[1:21:16.520 --> 1:21:17.520]  Here's Tucker Carlson.
[1:21:17.520 --> 1:21:20.440]  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson.
[1:21:20.440 --> 1:21:25.400]  Since tonight there was a lot going on right around the time of the last presidential inauguration,
[1:21:25.400 --> 1:21:30.720]  so you may have missed that on his very first day as president, Joe Biden ordered federal
[1:21:30.720 --> 1:21:35.320]  law enforcement and intelligence agencies to prepare a review of how the administration
[1:21:35.320 --> 1:21:37.280]  should fight terrorism.
[1:21:37.280 --> 1:21:39.280]  By last June, that report was complete.
[1:21:39.280 --> 1:21:44.400]  It concluded that after more than 20 years, Islamic terror is no longer the greatest threat
[1:21:44.400 --> 1:21:46.200]  to this country.
[1:21:46.200 --> 1:21:52.160]  Yet the agencies declared that domestic political extremism is, quote, the most urgent terrorism
[1:21:52.160 --> 1:21:55.240]  threat the United States faces today.
[1:21:55.240 --> 1:21:59.480]  That's a very stark assessment, so you have to ask who exactly are these terrorists who
[1:21:59.480 --> 1:22:02.760]  threaten us so urgently, and they're not who you might expect.
[1:22:02.760 --> 1:22:08.320]  The report did not even mention the BLM riots, the deadly BLM riots that had just taken place.
[1:22:08.320 --> 1:22:09.320]  There wasn't a word about Antifa.
[1:22:09.320 --> 1:22:13.920]  There was nothing about the gunmen who murdered 800 Americans in the city of Chicago last
[1:22:13.920 --> 1:22:14.920]  year.
[1:22:14.920 --> 1:22:15.920]  Many of them children.
[1:22:15.920 --> 1:22:21.400]  Instead, the Biden administration declared that the, quote, most lethal elements of today's
[1:22:21.400 --> 1:22:25.120]  domestic terror threat are political conservatives.
[1:22:25.120 --> 1:22:27.880]  There are people who disagree with Joe Biden.
[1:22:27.880 --> 1:22:32.680]  Now that report was released almost exactly six months ago, six months ago this Friday.
[1:22:32.680 --> 1:22:35.880]  It received relatively little attention and hasn't since.
[1:22:35.880 --> 1:22:39.920]  And no major news organization even asked the most obvious question.
[1:22:39.920 --> 1:22:43.360]  These terrorists who threaten us, where are they?
[1:22:43.360 --> 1:22:48.360]  If Trump voters are really the most, quote, lethal threat that our country faces today,
[1:22:48.360 --> 1:22:50.920]  where are all the people they've killed?
[1:22:50.920 --> 1:22:52.560]  That's not an easy question to answer.
[1:22:52.560 --> 1:22:56.320]  Just look at the numbers, which are fairly tidally kept.
[1:22:56.320 --> 1:22:59.880]  Take a look at all the Americans who died by violence over the past 12 months, and there
[1:22:59.880 --> 1:23:02.080]  are many thousands and thousands of Americans.
[1:23:02.080 --> 1:23:04.160]  I'm going to ask a simple question.
[1:23:04.160 --> 1:23:08.400]  How many of them were killed by right-wingers for political reasons?
[1:23:08.400 --> 1:23:09.680]  Not many.
[1:23:09.680 --> 1:23:13.360]  More since we're talking about threats here, pose the question another way.
[1:23:13.360 --> 1:23:19.200]  Are you more in danger walking through a neighborhood that votes 90% Democrat or a neighborhood
[1:23:19.200 --> 1:23:22.320]  that votes 90% Republican?
[1:23:22.320 --> 1:23:23.720]  Come on.
[1:23:23.720 --> 1:23:27.080]  This claim is ridiculous on its face.
[1:23:27.080 --> 1:23:31.600]  There is no substantial right-wing terror threat in this country, certainly not in relative
[1:23:31.600 --> 1:23:32.600]  terms.
[1:23:32.600 --> 1:23:34.000]  There just isn't.
[1:23:34.000 --> 1:23:35.840]  And no one's shown there is.
[1:23:35.840 --> 1:23:37.320]  The White House knows this, of course.
[1:23:37.320 --> 1:23:39.800]  They can read the numbers as well as anyone else can.
[1:23:39.800 --> 1:23:44.520]  So they're working hard to create the illusion of that threat, much hangs on their ability
[1:23:44.520 --> 1:23:46.160]  to do that.
[1:23:46.160 --> 1:23:50.360]  You may remember this story this fall about a group called the National School Boards Association,
[1:23:50.360 --> 1:23:54.840]  which sent a letter to the feds asking the DOJ to take a look at parents who don't like
[1:23:54.840 --> 1:23:56.840]  their kids' curriculums.
[1:23:56.840 --> 1:24:01.400]  The Justice Department responded immediately to that letter, talking about customer service.
[1:24:01.400 --> 1:24:05.800]  Days later, the Attorney General announced the FBI would investigate moms who dared to
[1:24:05.800 --> 1:24:09.960]  complain at school board meetings as potential terrorists.
[1:24:09.960 --> 1:24:14.080]  Many people were shocked by this story, but we just learned it's worse even than we thought
[1:24:14.080 --> 1:24:15.080]  it was.
[1:24:15.080 --> 1:24:20.200]  A new Freedom of Information Act request has revealed that the National School Boards Association
[1:24:20.200 --> 1:24:24.920]  asked the feds to investigate parents because the feds asked them to ask the feds to investigate
[1:24:24.920 --> 1:24:25.920]  parents.
[1:24:25.920 --> 1:24:27.400]  See how that works?
[1:24:27.400 --> 1:24:31.640]  Apparently the Secretary of Education, Miguel Cardona, told school board administrators
[1:24:31.640 --> 1:24:33.800]  to write their letter to the White House.
[1:24:33.800 --> 1:24:39.600]  The White House then used that letter as a pretext to begin a crackdown on parents.
[1:24:39.600 --> 1:24:40.600]  See how that works?
[1:24:40.600 --> 1:24:42.200]  The snake eating its tail.
[1:24:42.200 --> 1:24:46.240]  When you don't have enough domestic terrorists to justify a political purge, then you just
[1:24:46.240 --> 1:24:49.600]  go ahead and create them, and that's exactly what they've been doing.
[1:24:49.600 --> 1:24:55.680]  This week, the campaign against this new American al-Qaeda entered a new and very ominous phase.
[1:24:55.680 --> 1:24:58.240]  Again, little noticed by the national media.
[1:24:58.240 --> 1:25:03.600]  This Tuesday, two days ago, the DOJ announced the creation of a new domestic terrorism unit.
[1:25:03.600 --> 1:25:04.600]  What will it do?
[1:25:04.600 --> 1:25:09.560]  Well, it will target, quote, anti-authority ideologues, anti-authority ideologues.
[1:25:09.560 --> 1:25:15.400]  Now, keep in mind, this country was founded by people who are anti-authority ideologues.
[1:25:15.400 --> 1:25:20.200]  That's why they created America and baked the idea of opposing authority, so it doesn't
[1:25:20.200 --> 1:25:24.440]  get too big and take over your life, into our founding documents.
[1:25:24.440 --> 1:25:26.880]  These ideas are central to the American idea.
[1:25:26.880 --> 1:25:29.200]  In fact, they are the American idea.
[1:25:29.200 --> 1:25:31.800]  But in this administration, they are now crimes.
[1:25:31.800 --> 1:25:34.800]  Here's Matt Olson, the assistant attorney general, explaining.
[1:25:34.800 --> 1:25:41.840]  We face an elevated threat from domestic violent extremists, that is, individuals in the United
[1:25:41.840 --> 1:25:48.120]  States who seek to commit violent criminal acts in furtherance of domestic, social or
[1:25:48.120 --> 1:25:50.240]  political goals.
[1:25:50.240 --> 1:25:56.200]  Domestic violent extremists are often motivated by a mix of ideologies and personal grievances.
[1:25:56.200 --> 1:26:01.080]  We've seen a growing threat from those who are motivated by racial animus, as well as
[1:26:01.080 --> 1:26:06.440]  those who ascribe to extremist anti-government and anti-authority ideologies.
[1:26:06.440 --> 1:26:13.400]  I've decided to establish a domestic terrorism unit to augment our existing approach.
[1:26:13.400 --> 1:26:18.800]  This group of dedicated attorneys will focus on the domestic terrorism threat.
[1:26:18.800 --> 1:26:20.080]  Who's the threat to the country?
[1:26:20.080 --> 1:26:23.720]  That guy is the threat to the country, and the people working for him and those propping
[1:26:23.720 --> 1:26:29.160]  him up, and the people spreading the core lie here.
[1:26:29.160 --> 1:26:33.880]  Which is that American citizens who distrust the government or don't like its policies
[1:26:33.880 --> 1:26:35.320]  are terrorists.
[1:26:35.320 --> 1:26:39.600]  Just today, on MSNBC, Jason Johnson, one of its contributors, described the entire Republican
[1:26:39.600 --> 1:26:42.760]  party as a terrorist organization.
[1:26:42.760 --> 1:26:44.640]  So you can see where this is going.
[1:26:44.640 --> 1:26:47.400]  Again, and we're quoting now, this is the assistant attorney general.
[1:26:47.400 --> 1:26:51.520]  We have seen a growing threat from those who ascribe to anti-government and anti-authority
[1:26:51.520 --> 1:26:52.520]  ideologies.
[1:26:52.520 --> 1:26:55.120]  Really, is that threat growing?
[1:26:55.120 --> 1:26:56.120]  Is it true?
[1:26:56.120 --> 1:26:57.120]  Let's see here.
[1:26:57.120 --> 1:27:01.560]  This threat is being used to justify the creation of this agency, but it's not rooted in reality.
[1:27:01.560 --> 1:27:07.040]  27 years ago, back in 1995, you'll remember, 168 people were murdered in the Oklahoma City
[1:27:07.040 --> 1:27:08.040]  bombing.
[1:27:08.040 --> 1:27:09.880]  Another 700 were injured.
[1:27:09.880 --> 1:27:15.840]  Now, the investigation into what happened that day involved nearly 30,000 interviews.
[1:27:15.840 --> 1:27:20.440]  Investigators gathered 7,000 pounds of evidence we could go on.
[1:27:20.440 --> 1:27:21.840]  It was an enormous investigation.
[1:27:21.840 --> 1:27:25.240]  Attorney General Merrick Garland, by the way, was part of it at the time.
[1:27:25.240 --> 1:27:32.720]  Here's the point, despite the size of that investigation, no one suggested, even hinted,
[1:27:32.720 --> 1:27:36.960]  that we might need to create a new domestic terror division within the DOJ to handle the
[1:27:36.960 --> 1:27:37.960]  problem.
[1:27:37.960 --> 1:27:43.920]  No, the whole thing was handled by FBI field offices, as things like this had been for
[1:27:43.920 --> 1:27:44.920]  many decades.
[1:27:44.920 --> 1:27:49.200]  The FBI field offices did their jobs, the man accused of doing it got the death penalty,
[1:27:49.200 --> 1:27:52.040]  and you may have noticed it didn't happen again.
[1:27:52.040 --> 1:27:57.360]  And then Joe Biden became president, and the number of so-called domestic terror investigations
[1:27:57.360 --> 1:27:59.440]  more than doubled.
[1:27:59.440 --> 1:28:01.480]  So the question is, what exactly are they investigating?
[1:28:01.480 --> 1:28:07.520]  If there's no substantial death toll from these terrorists in our midst, what exactly
[1:28:07.520 --> 1:28:08.520]  are the feds looking into?
[1:28:08.520 --> 1:28:13.360]  Well, they're taking a close look at crimes like the plot to kidnap Michigan Governor
[1:28:13.360 --> 1:28:18.120]  Gretchen Whitmer, a plot that helped her political fortunes considerably.
[1:28:18.120 --> 1:28:19.120]  What did it consist of?
[1:28:19.120 --> 1:28:24.640]  Well, that conspiracy in the end turned out to have more FBI agents and informants involved
[1:28:24.640 --> 1:28:26.600]  than would be kidnappers.
[1:28:26.600 --> 1:28:30.040]  The guy the feds said were running it turned out to be homeless.
[1:28:30.040 --> 1:28:33.080]  He was living in the basement of a vacuum repair shop.
[1:28:33.080 --> 1:28:36.360]  His friends called him Captain Autism.
[1:28:36.360 --> 1:28:38.560]  And they called him that for a reason.
[1:28:38.560 --> 1:28:41.160]  He wasn't the ringleader of anything.
[1:28:41.160 --> 1:28:42.160]  He couldn't have been.
[1:28:42.160 --> 1:28:44.600]  The whole thing was ridiculous.
[1:28:44.600 --> 1:28:48.520]  But it stoked the storyline that was politically expedient, and so the media uncritically
[1:28:48.520 --> 1:28:51.280]  promoted it again and again, as if it were real.
[1:28:51.280 --> 1:28:55.640]  The media's job, by the way, to remind you is to push back against government statements
[1:28:55.640 --> 1:29:25.560]  to find that if they're actually true.
[1:29:25.560 --> 1:29:55.180]  So yeah, we'll see you next time.
[1:29:55.560 --> 1:30:03.080]  Everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has only been the build-up for what
[1:30:03.080 --> 1:30:05.040]  the globalists are doing right now.
[1:30:05.040 --> 1:30:06.760]  This is their big offensive.
[1:30:06.760 --> 1:30:08.200]  This is their takeover.
[1:30:08.200 --> 1:30:11.480]  And this is the point that they're at their very weakest, because now they've revealed
[1:30:11.480 --> 1:30:12.480]  themselves.
[1:30:12.480 --> 1:30:16.200]  Now they're a world government, they're permanent martial law, their medical tyranny is out
[1:30:16.200 --> 1:30:17.200]  in the open.
[1:30:17.200 --> 1:30:21.720]  Their depopulation agenda has been exposed, but they're using their corporate power and
[1:30:21.720 --> 1:30:26.000]  trillions to go across the planet and shut down people telling the truth.
[1:30:26.000 --> 1:30:29.280]  So listen, Paul Revere's, when you spread the word about the broadcast, when you pray
[1:30:29.280 --> 1:30:31.400]  for the broadcast, you're the tip of the sphere.
[1:30:31.400 --> 1:30:35.000]  And when you buy products at infowarstore.com, you keep us on air.

[1:31:33.520 --> 1:31:34.880]  And the calls are free when folks call you.

[1:31:42.640 --> 1:31:43.640]  or traced.

[1:31:47.080 --> 1:31:54.280]  where regular phones don't work, they work, infowarstore.com or 941-955-1029-4195-1020 and
[1:31:54.280 --> 1:31:57.680]  ask the Alex Jones Special.
[1:31:57.680 --> 1:32:02.360]  The average person on the face of this incredible planet is still unaware that there's a war
[1:32:02.360 --> 1:32:08.000]  between free individuals and nation-states on one side and the globalist on the other
[1:32:08.000 --> 1:32:11.000]  who are literally trying to create a post-human world.
[1:32:11.000 --> 1:32:15.800]  For the United States and Brazil, and of course, triggered by the Brexit in the UK, nations
[1:32:15.800 --> 1:32:19.480]  were pulling out of the private corporate fascist world government.
[1:32:19.480 --> 1:32:24.880]  That's why they launched their great reset and their program after collapsing us of Build
[1:32:24.880 --> 1:32:26.680]  Back Better.
[1:32:26.680 --> 1:32:32.680]  This is nothing more than a top-down vertical consolidation of the world economy because
[1:32:32.680 --> 1:32:37.000]  they couldn't take our guns and because we wouldn't bow because the left, which is the
[1:32:37.000 --> 1:32:42.480]  ideology of this world government system, couldn't win, they released a biological weapon on
[1:32:42.480 --> 1:32:43.480]  us.
[1:32:43.480 --> 1:32:48.320]  Now we know, two years ago, we learned about it about 20 months ago, it's that simple,
[1:32:48.320 --> 1:32:52.680]  they can't meet us because of our free speech and our guns, so the global corporate combine
[1:32:52.680 --> 1:32:55.880]  released COVID-19 and you know the rest of history.
[1:32:55.880 --> 1:33:00.480]  Expose this paradigm and we win.
[1:33:00.480 --> 1:33:16.640]  Bringing a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:16.640 --> 1:33:35.000]  Trashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:35.000 --> 1:33:36.000]  You're serious about this?
[1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:38.120]  First of all, I got to talk about the hair.
[1:33:38.120 --> 1:33:44.240]  Your hair is so big, it doesn't work on a campaign commercial, you're serious about
[1:33:44.240 --> 1:33:45.240]  this.
[1:33:45.240 --> 1:33:48.760]  I'm serious, I have decided I want to be the captain of the Titanic.
[1:33:48.760 --> 1:33:49.760]  Sign me up.
[1:33:49.760 --> 1:33:50.760]  Yeah.
[1:33:50.760 --> 1:33:54.440]  So you're running as a Republican, we got to get basics here.
[1:33:54.440 --> 1:33:56.600]  Well, I'm running as an independent.
[1:33:56.600 --> 1:33:57.600]  You're running as an independent.
[1:33:57.600 --> 1:34:01.240]  I went to the Republican Party, that's a whole other story, I mean that's a whole other show.
[1:34:01.240 --> 1:34:03.920]  So you're running as independent, does that mean there's a primary that you got to go
[1:34:03.920 --> 1:34:04.920]  through?
[1:34:04.920 --> 1:34:05.920]  I don't know.
[1:34:05.920 --> 1:34:06.920]  Okay.
[1:34:06.920 --> 1:34:07.920]  But you know, Republican...
[1:34:07.920 --> 1:34:09.320]  It might be something you should figure out.
[1:34:09.320 --> 1:34:14.040]  No, but look, this guy Griffin is running as a Democrat, he's going to be the front
[1:34:14.040 --> 1:34:15.040]  runner probably.
[1:34:15.040 --> 1:34:19.840]  Well, you take Griffin, the billionaire, he's going to fund a Republican to take on...
[1:34:19.840 --> 1:34:21.040]  Well, the guy's not a Republican.
[1:34:21.040 --> 1:34:22.040]  Right.
[1:34:22.040 --> 1:34:23.040]  But hold it, so you're running as an independent...
[1:34:23.040 --> 1:34:24.040]  The point is, you buy your way in, brother.
[1:34:24.040 --> 1:34:25.040]  You buy your way in.
[1:34:25.040 --> 1:34:26.040]  You're running as an independent.
[1:34:26.040 --> 1:34:27.040]  Yeah.
[1:34:27.040 --> 1:34:32.120]  Is the ballot going to say, like, Man Cow or is it going to be Eric Man Cow Muller?
[1:34:32.120 --> 1:34:34.120]  Because you can't have a nickname on there.
[1:34:34.120 --> 1:34:35.360]  You know, you can?
[1:34:35.360 --> 1:34:36.360]  Yeah.
[1:34:36.360 --> 1:34:44.040]  Well, Eric Man Cow Muller, good friend of mine now for, gosh, it's got to be coming
[1:34:44.040 --> 1:34:45.840]  on the show for like 20 years.
[1:34:45.840 --> 1:34:50.000]  We've been friends for at least 15, he's come to visit me, we've hung out quite a bit.
[1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:54.000]  And I wonder, Roger Stone is lurking in the background involved with this because you'd
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:58.280]  make a great Illinois governor to go in there as a populist and really to, you know, bring
[1:34:58.280 --> 1:35:01.480]  people together from the left and right to save that state, the boy doesn't need to be
[1:35:01.480 --> 1:35:02.480]  saved.
[1:35:02.480 --> 1:35:05.480]  So, Mr. Eric Man Cow Muller, great to have you here with us, governor.
[1:35:05.480 --> 1:35:14.480]  Alex, it's, wow, it's good to see you, but it's good to see you, you know, everybody's
[1:35:14.480 --> 1:35:17.480]  missing the point.
[1:35:17.480 --> 1:35:18.480]  I'm tired.
[1:35:18.480 --> 1:35:19.480]  I've been all over, man.
[1:35:19.480 --> 1:35:20.480]  I've been all over campaigning.
[1:35:20.480 --> 1:35:25.480]  You know, taking the awesome, just taking the awesome, just taking the awesome stuff.
[1:35:25.480 --> 1:35:26.480]  All right.
[1:35:26.480 --> 1:35:27.480]  Hey, hey, hey, Man Cow.
[1:35:27.480 --> 1:35:30.360]  Every, you do so good on your own show and every other show, but we have a bad jinx
[1:35:30.360 --> 1:35:31.360]  with us.
[1:35:31.360 --> 1:35:35.240]  The audio was fine and then you just turned your mic off or did something.
[1:35:35.240 --> 1:35:36.240]  So fix it.
[1:35:36.240 --> 1:35:38.200]  We're going to go back to Man Cow.
[1:35:38.200 --> 1:35:42.520]  So much to talk about here with this wild man and I mean, I'm really glad he's running
[1:35:42.520 --> 1:35:43.520]  for governor.
[1:35:43.520 --> 1:35:45.360]  He definitely needs to run for governor.
[1:35:45.360 --> 1:35:48.880]  We are in such a crazy world and they're trying to put me in prison for January 6th
[1:35:48.880 --> 1:35:49.880]  right now.
[1:35:49.880 --> 1:35:53.680]  And we've got all of that insanity going on and so we're going to be talking to him
[1:35:53.680 --> 1:35:54.680]  about that.
[1:35:54.680 --> 1:35:58.280]  And then come up about 15 minutes to the next hour, got a bunch of the news hit before they
[1:35:58.280 --> 1:35:59.280]  come on.
[1:35:59.280 --> 1:36:04.240]  We have an Oathkeeper joining us who got out of it right at the end there.
[1:36:04.240 --> 1:36:05.760]  He saw some weird behavior.
[1:36:05.760 --> 1:36:10.080]  Now, I'm not here to judge Stuart Rhodes or judge the indictment, though I read it twice
[1:36:10.080 --> 1:36:12.560]  once last night and once this morning.
[1:36:12.560 --> 1:36:22.480]  And I've seen so much fake stuff in the record about Owen Schreuer and myself and others
[1:36:22.480 --> 1:36:26.000]  by the feds that I don't know what to believe.
[1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:34.280]  And I guess that's kind of their plan, but it is crazy, crazy, crazy lies that the system
[1:36:34.280 --> 1:36:35.600]  that the system is putting out.
[1:36:35.600 --> 1:36:38.440]  I mean, just just like on its face stuff that just isn't true.
[1:36:38.440 --> 1:36:40.800]  Like, Owen Schreuer went to the Capitol and attacked people.
[1:36:40.800 --> 1:36:43.040]  Owen Schreuer is does not work for all of Jones.
[1:36:43.040 --> 1:36:44.360]  He's perjuring himself, your honor.
[1:36:44.360 --> 1:36:49.960]  I mean, just like, why would you put lies like that in there?
[1:36:49.960 --> 1:36:55.960]  I mean, it's kind of like when you call and you get a customer service rep.
[1:36:55.960 --> 1:37:01.520]  You get a customer service rep that doesn't really speak English, but acts like they do.
[1:37:01.520 --> 1:37:08.320]  And it's like they've got, I love Indians, but you know what I mean, Indians in India
[1:37:08.320 --> 1:37:12.520]  that are writing all this and doing all this because you read it and it's like it's English
[1:37:12.520 --> 1:37:14.880]  words, but it has no reflection reality.
[1:37:14.880 --> 1:37:17.000]  All right, we do have his audio now.
[1:37:17.000 --> 1:37:18.240]  What a buildup.
[1:37:18.240 --> 1:37:19.960]  The man cow.
[1:37:19.960 --> 1:37:22.800]  So you are officially running for governor of Illinois.
[1:37:22.800 --> 1:37:25.320]  Alex, I am, can you hear me now?
[1:37:25.320 --> 1:37:32.360]  I can hear you, sir, please tell us what's going on.
[1:37:32.360 --> 1:37:33.360]  It's interesting.
[1:37:33.360 --> 1:37:37.360]  You know, you talk about the sound as soon as I announced I was running for governor,
[1:37:37.360 --> 1:37:41.040]  there's all kinds of workers around the house.
[1:37:41.040 --> 1:37:42.040]  I'm not even kidding.
[1:37:42.040 --> 1:37:43.040]  I've got to believe you.
[1:37:43.040 --> 1:37:44.040]  Believe me.
[1:37:44.040 --> 1:37:45.040]  I know.
[1:37:45.040 --> 1:37:46.040]  I know.
[1:37:46.040 --> 1:37:49.120]  They had to work on the wires around my house yesterday.
[1:37:49.120 --> 1:37:55.000]  The next morning after I announced, your coincidence, Alex, the real story that I've
[1:37:55.000 --> 1:38:00.200]  said on every show that maybe you'll pick up on, or maybe they don't want to pick up
[1:38:00.200 --> 1:38:07.640]  on it, is that, you know, I went to the Republicans and maybe it's my gut.
[1:38:07.640 --> 1:38:14.560]  Maybe it's, maybe I'm wrong, but it seemed very clear to me you have the name recognition,
[1:38:14.560 --> 1:38:20.720]  but you know, this guy, Jim Oberweiss, he's a local guy, he gave us millions.
[1:38:20.720 --> 1:38:22.280]  It was all about money.
[1:38:22.280 --> 1:38:23.880]  That's what I'm trying to tell you.
[1:38:23.880 --> 1:38:24.880]  Are you there?
[1:38:24.880 --> 1:38:26.600]  I am here, man, Cal.
[1:38:26.600 --> 1:38:27.600]  Hit us and hit us hard.
[1:38:27.600 --> 1:38:28.600]  We love it.
[1:38:28.600 --> 1:38:29.600]  Yeah.
[1:38:29.600 --> 1:38:32.160]  No, I mean, it's just, and they go, uh-huh.
[1:38:32.160 --> 1:38:35.920]  And I did, I did the number one show here yesterday, Alex.
[1:38:35.920 --> 1:38:38.480]  And I said, look, I want school choice.
[1:38:38.480 --> 1:38:41.160]  I want to end the mandates.
[1:38:41.160 --> 1:38:44.060]  I want to cut the gas tax in half.
[1:38:44.060 --> 1:38:47.760]  We have 25 cents a gallon gas tax.
[1:38:47.760 --> 1:38:50.760]  I mean, school choice, cut the gas tax, cut property tax.
[1:38:50.760 --> 1:38:55.720]  I pay $45,000 a year in property tax.
[1:38:55.720 --> 1:39:00.880]  And I went through this long, you know, end sanctuary city, I went through this long list
[1:39:00.880 --> 1:39:05.880]  and the liberal reporter goes, well, you're not, you're not saying anything.
[1:39:05.880 --> 1:39:06.880]  That's just gibberish.
[1:39:06.880 --> 1:39:07.880]  That's right.
[1:39:07.880 --> 1:39:12.040]  You're giving them a real policies that are very popular and they won't even basically
[1:39:12.040 --> 1:39:15.920]  quote you because they're just going to say it's not real.
[1:39:15.920 --> 1:39:18.000]  Say that again.
[1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:21.520]  They never actually meet us on the level playing field and have a debate.
[1:39:21.520 --> 1:39:25.360]  They always just act like they don't understand what we're saying.
[1:39:25.360 --> 1:39:29.200]  You know, Alex, I always go into these things like John Wayne and Noel Coward hanging out.
[1:39:29.200 --> 1:39:33.080]  I always feel like I can hang out and talk and that there's common ground.
[1:39:33.080 --> 1:39:36.160]  You know, I'm like a hobbit, you know, looking for the shire, looking for middle earth, looking
[1:39:36.160 --> 1:39:38.600]  for middle ground.
[1:39:38.600 --> 1:39:43.080]  And it is like the commies have the blinders on, man.
[1:39:43.080 --> 1:39:47.320]  Get the shot, step in line, your business will be destroyed.
[1:39:47.320 --> 1:39:52.720]  We had a car dealer here, one of the biggest Joe Perillo who, you know, his place got destroyed
[1:39:52.720 --> 1:39:55.120]  and they said, well, you should have had more security.
[1:39:55.120 --> 1:39:59.600]  And he said security, you're the, you, you want to defund the cops.
[1:39:59.600 --> 1:40:01.440]  They want to defund the cops.
[1:40:01.440 --> 1:40:02.600]  I defend the cops.
[1:40:02.600 --> 1:40:04.800]  They want to defund the cops.
[1:40:04.800 --> 1:40:06.960]  And you know, of course, when you get robbed, it's your fault.
[1:40:06.960 --> 1:40:10.680]  I was about to add, I noticed Lightfoot said it's the shot.
[1:40:10.680 --> 1:40:14.560]  I tried to get you on a month ago, but you couldn't come on.
[1:40:14.560 --> 1:40:21.840]  Lightfoot, for those that don't know, you're insane Admiral Ackbar leader saying that it's
[1:40:21.840 --> 1:40:26.160]  the business's fault they're being robbed and they want to defund the police and they
[1:40:26.160 --> 1:40:27.880]  don't want you to have a gun to defend yourselves.
[1:40:27.880 --> 1:40:31.560]  I mean, these are some really bad people.
[1:40:31.560 --> 1:40:37.240]  I was engaged to a woman that ran the Monterey Bay rape crisis center and I'll never forget
[1:40:37.240 --> 1:40:40.800]  going to court with her, you know, these women we were trying to help.
[1:40:40.800 --> 1:40:45.520]  And they would, you know, the other side would say, why did you wear a sexy underwear?
[1:40:45.520 --> 1:40:47.400]  Why did you wear a sexy, a sexy outfit?
[1:40:47.400 --> 1:40:51.240]  I mean, if you didn't want to be raped, you're like, why do you got a jewelry store?
[1:40:51.240 --> 1:40:58.720]  She said, if you don't want to get robbed, yeah, I mean, this is a look brother, we are,
[1:40:58.720 --> 1:41:01.120]  you know, we used to joke about prison planet.
[1:41:01.120 --> 1:41:07.400]  I mean, oh God, it was so funny when Alex Jones said prison planet and you know, I
[1:41:07.400 --> 1:41:10.680]  ribbed you about it and by God, if I'm not living in, I don't, if I'm living on a prison
[1:41:10.680 --> 1:41:14.880]  planet, but I'm living in a prison state right now.
[1:41:14.880 --> 1:41:16.440]  We were under house arrest for two years.
[1:41:16.440 --> 1:41:18.440]  Who knew a governor could do that?
[1:41:18.440 --> 1:41:23.920]  So I want to become governor, mancalfordgovernor.com and I'll tell you what I'm going to do, nothing.
[1:41:23.920 --> 1:41:25.440]  I'm going to leave you alone.
[1:41:25.440 --> 1:41:26.960]  I'm not going to put you under house arrest.
[1:41:26.960 --> 1:41:28.960]  Your kids are going to go back to school.
[1:41:28.960 --> 1:41:29.960]  Exactly.
[1:41:29.960 --> 1:41:33.680]  That's what America is about is just leave us alone.
[1:41:33.680 --> 1:41:34.680]  Yeah.
[1:41:34.680 --> 1:41:35.680]  Yeah.
[1:41:35.680 --> 1:41:37.440]  And it's such a foreign concept.
[1:41:37.440 --> 1:41:38.440]  Look at this.
[1:41:38.440 --> 1:41:40.560]  Look at this genius.
[1:41:40.560 --> 1:41:43.280]  Alex, I want to tell you something that you're well versed in.
[1:41:43.280 --> 1:41:44.280]  Okay.
[1:41:44.280 --> 1:41:51.040]  So, so, uh, Alex, can you hear me?
[1:41:51.040 --> 1:41:52.040]  Mancalf.
[1:41:52.040 --> 1:41:53.040]  Yes, I can hear you.
[1:41:53.040 --> 1:41:54.400]  I'm having all kinds of stuff happen.
[1:41:54.400 --> 1:41:55.400]  I haven't had happen.
[1:41:55.400 --> 1:41:56.800]  I mean, this is, this is unbelievable.
[1:41:56.800 --> 1:41:59.360]  I mean, I'm not saying it's you, but I'm saying it's you.
[1:41:59.360 --> 1:42:02.400]  I, I, I like the glasses.
[1:42:02.400 --> 1:42:03.400]  Yeah.
[1:42:03.400 --> 1:42:07.240]  Well, I look a little tired, so I, but, but take the glasses off.
[1:42:07.240 --> 1:42:09.920]  We want to see your eyes.
[1:42:09.920 --> 1:42:10.920]  You do not look tired.
[1:42:10.920 --> 1:42:11.920]  You look very good.
[1:42:11.920 --> 1:42:15.920]  And we got to go to college, but you're going to have to stay an extra segment now because
[1:42:15.920 --> 1:42:17.600]  this one's been, been decent.
[1:42:17.600 --> 1:42:21.800]  You always have raised up to say, but I want you to, I want the man cow I see on your show.
[1:42:21.800 --> 1:42:24.640]  Whenever you come on my show, you're, you're a little bit pensive.
[1:42:24.640 --> 1:42:30.000]  You're a little bit, I want us to see governor man cow in his first day in office when we
[1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:32.800]  come back and what you're going to do because you could easily get elected.
[1:42:32.800 --> 1:42:33.800]  You're very popular.
[1:42:33.800 --> 1:42:37.160]  We've had the number one show for a long time in Illinois.
[1:42:37.160 --> 1:42:39.760]  And so we're going to, yes, we love your eyes.
[1:42:39.760 --> 1:42:40.760]  All right.
[1:42:40.760 --> 1:42:42.760]  This is a very gay moment right now.

[1:43:50.080 --> 1:43:52.880]  exposing the great reset and the new world order.
[1:43:52.880 --> 1:43:56.160]  So support your immune system and support free speech in the fight for liberty at the
[1:43:56.160 --> 1:43:59.760]  same time at infowarstore.com.
[1:43:59.760 --> 1:44:04.200]  I want to explain something that is absolutely seed understanding our world that's very,
[1:44:04.200 --> 1:44:06.800]  very simple, but the multiple don't know.
[1:44:06.800 --> 1:44:13.520]  The privately owned central banks of the world are artificially creating thousands of trillions
[1:44:13.520 --> 1:44:20.080]  of dollars and other major currencies and using them to buy up infrastructure, intellectual
[1:44:20.080 --> 1:44:23.080]  property, energy.
[1:44:23.080 --> 1:44:28.080]  They're using it to buy people, to buy influence and in the past they created thousands of
[1:44:28.080 --> 1:44:32.040]  trillions so that they could leverage that manipulated market for they never allowed
[1:44:32.040 --> 1:44:37.080]  that money to get into the general circulation or it would cause massive inflation.
[1:44:37.080 --> 1:44:41.600]  Now they've gone ahead and weaponized it and are flooding every sector of the world economy
[1:44:41.600 --> 1:44:47.560]  buying up everything not to have the companies operate, but to actually shut them down and
[1:44:47.560 --> 1:44:52.320]  force a collapse of civilization, making the companies they do fund the only things left
[1:44:52.320 --> 1:44:53.320]  standing.
[1:44:53.320 --> 1:44:59.120]  As the Gregory said, this is what's happening now for everyone is the only way to stop it.
[1:44:59.120 --> 1:45:05.200]  God created each and every one of us with free will, but we look at the world system
[1:45:05.200 --> 1:45:08.560]  now openly announcing the mark of the beast.
[1:45:08.560 --> 1:45:13.800]  Everything that it's attempting to do is built around getting rid of our free will and making
[1:45:13.800 --> 1:45:20.040]  us bow down and submit and turn our very bodies, our very productivity, our very genetics,
[1:45:20.040 --> 1:45:24.240]  our very future over to them.
[1:45:24.240 --> 1:45:26.000]  They want control of procreation.
[1:45:26.000 --> 1:45:28.960]  They want control of the relationships between men and women.
[1:45:28.960 --> 1:45:34.760]  They want to bring a form of living death to our society and our civilization.
[1:45:34.760 --> 1:45:40.400]  All of us were formed and made in God's mind and God's image and given free will and make
[1:45:40.400 --> 1:45:45.800]  no mistake all of you alive today were created by God to be alive in this special time so
[1:45:45.800 --> 1:45:50.840]  that you could make the right decision free will and stand against evil.
[1:45:50.840 --> 1:45:57.240]  And then, for eternity, win the great birthright prize of being aligned with God.
[1:45:57.240 --> 1:46:02.440]  Get our great bag of it here.
[1:46:02.440 --> 1:46:07.160]  I mean this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the Communists?
[1:46:07.160 --> 1:46:11.880]  Well that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic
[1:46:11.880 --> 1:46:15.680]  in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee and yeah, we buy it from the little
[1:46:15.680 --> 1:46:19.640]  farmers that, you know, the media calls Communists but really they're just a commune and whatever
[1:46:19.640 --> 1:46:23.200]  the point is is that it's good coffee and we've got it and the farmers don't let the
[1:46:23.200 --> 1:46:24.200]  Mexican government take over.
[1:46:24.200 --> 1:46:27.640]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for what, 14 years
[1:46:27.640 --> 1:46:28.840]  and the price has never gone up.
[1:46:28.840 --> 1:46:33.560]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound and I just
[1:46:33.560 --> 1:46:35.720]  think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[1:46:35.720 --> 1:46:40.360]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas Rebels, literally, in fact, I'm not
[1:46:40.360 --> 1:46:42.360]  going to tell you that story.
[1:46:42.360 --> 1:46:52.240]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation and if you don't
[1:46:52.240 --> 1:47:20.280]  find us and don't want to see it, that's fine.
[1:47:20.280 --> 1:47:48.440]  Well, you said I was pensive and that kind of irritated me because I've never been pensive.
[1:47:48.440 --> 1:47:50.440]  That's not a word that's ever been used.
[1:47:50.440 --> 1:47:51.440]  I know.
[1:47:51.440 --> 1:47:52.440]  That's why I used it to antagonize.
[1:47:52.440 --> 1:47:53.440]  I'm antagonizing you.
[1:47:53.440 --> 1:47:58.760]  We had 1,000 people murdered here last year, 1,000 murdered.
[1:47:58.760 --> 1:47:59.760]  I own a restaurant here.
[1:47:59.760 --> 1:48:01.520]  I've had a Ford car dealership.
[1:48:01.520 --> 1:48:06.240]  I know about business and I'm going to look brother doing the radio show and I say you're
[1:48:06.240 --> 1:48:11.560]  my brother because we've been radio brothers for 20 years but look, I know the best of
[1:48:11.560 --> 1:48:12.560]  the best.
[1:48:12.560 --> 1:48:13.560]  I interviewed all these politicians.
[1:48:13.560 --> 1:48:15.280]  I know they're all full of shit.
[1:48:15.280 --> 1:48:16.280]  They don't do anything.
[1:48:16.280 --> 1:48:17.280]  They say they're going to do.
[1:48:17.280 --> 1:48:20.880]  All I'm telling you is I'm going to leave you alone.
[1:48:20.880 --> 1:48:22.760]  I should call the party to do nothing.
[1:48:22.760 --> 1:48:26.040]  You're a good man from rural Missouri and everybody I've met from Missouri are good
[1:48:26.040 --> 1:48:27.040]  folks.
[1:48:27.040 --> 1:48:28.600]  Well, I think so.
[1:48:28.600 --> 1:48:29.600]  I think so.
[1:48:29.600 --> 1:48:33.920]  The heartland, God fearing people but you know, brother, the tollboots, they were put
[1:48:33.920 --> 1:48:37.600]  in to pay for the roads 100 years ago, 50 years ago.
[1:48:37.600 --> 1:48:38.880]  I mean, everything is built on the line.
[1:48:38.880 --> 1:48:40.840]  We got red light cameras everywhere.
[1:48:40.840 --> 1:48:44.480]  We're told you can turn right on red but then you get a red light camera ticket and I'm
[1:48:44.480 --> 1:48:45.720]  going to stop all this.
[1:48:45.720 --> 1:48:47.560]  We have the money.
[1:48:47.560 --> 1:48:49.400]  We're just being ripped off.
[1:48:49.400 --> 1:48:54.000]  So I haven't been told by top people they use high taxes as social engineering to keep
[1:48:54.000 --> 1:48:55.000]  you down.
[1:48:55.000 --> 1:48:57.120]  They're not doing all these taxes to so they get money.
[1:48:57.120 --> 1:48:58.960]  They're doing it to shut things down.
[1:48:58.960 --> 1:48:59.960]  Yeah.
[1:48:59.960 --> 1:49:05.240]  And you know, we've talked about the secret highway that I was on and look brother, I
[1:49:05.240 --> 1:49:12.560]  tell you brother, I tell you, it's the same side of the same coin.
[1:49:12.560 --> 1:49:18.840]  We have a fake fight going on and I know this isn't news to you but I don't think people
[1:49:18.840 --> 1:49:19.840]  understand.
[1:49:19.840 --> 1:49:24.040]  It's like the generals versus the globetrotters.
[1:49:24.040 --> 1:49:26.640]  No matter what happens, we get screwed.
[1:49:26.640 --> 1:49:29.040]  The people get screwed and I'm sick of it.
[1:49:29.040 --> 1:49:32.280]  Look at my kid's hat, look what they were reading.
[1:49:32.280 --> 1:49:37.680]  Yeah, that's required reading in my kid's school.
[1:49:37.680 --> 1:49:41.080]  It's so wonderful being here, so wonderful being in Illinois.
[1:49:41.080 --> 1:49:43.000]  You can't go downtown, you can't do anything.
[1:49:43.000 --> 1:49:46.800]  People are terrified to go outside, you have to have papers to get into a restaurant.
[1:49:46.800 --> 1:49:49.360]  I mean, this is real Gestapo shit.
[1:49:49.360 --> 1:49:51.520]  And remember, we're not just on TV.
[1:49:51.520 --> 1:49:54.920]  The biggest audience is on radio, over 300 affiliates, we don't like to brag as it makes
[1:49:54.920 --> 1:49:57.760]  the enemy get upset, but over 300 right now.
[1:49:57.760 --> 1:50:02.080]  And even though Talk Radio is a shadow of its former self, still a huge audience.
[1:50:02.080 --> 1:50:05.720]  For those that don't know, the book that's required reading at your son's school is
[1:50:05.720 --> 1:50:07.560]  Two Boys Kissing.
[1:50:07.560 --> 1:50:12.680]  Listen, you know, I'm sorry, I said a curse word.
[1:50:12.680 --> 1:50:16.480]  I thought it was you and I doing the old internet show where I could finally let go.
[1:50:16.480 --> 1:50:20.160]  No, we can delay it out, but hey, I wasn't bringing that up, you know, you're on radio.
[1:50:20.160 --> 1:50:22.000]  We delay it, it's fine.
[1:50:22.000 --> 1:50:29.000]  But speaking of Illinois, in Chicago, that's the language of hell.
[1:50:29.000 --> 1:50:32.600]  I don't allow anyone to blast him around me.
[1:50:32.600 --> 1:50:34.600]  And I know, you know, I know Alex, you're being attacked.
[1:50:34.600 --> 1:50:39.560]  And look, when you step up and you decide to take a stand for good, and you stand up,
[1:50:39.560 --> 1:50:40.840]  you're going to get attacked.
[1:50:40.840 --> 1:50:43.320]  So you just pray for the Sacred Heart of Christ to look after you.
[1:50:43.320 --> 1:50:48.080]  And I pray, and I hope the audience will pray for me as well, that I have a shield of protection
[1:50:48.080 --> 1:50:50.520]  and a hedge of protection around my family.
[1:50:50.520 --> 1:50:51.840]  Let me ask you this.
[1:50:51.840 --> 1:50:56.680]  What about the Satanic Temple, not just drag queen story time, now at Illinois schools
[1:50:56.680 --> 1:51:07.920]  in Chicago, the elementary students are going to get school-sponsored Satan visits.
[1:51:07.920 --> 1:51:14.960]  I mean, why we don't rise up and tear that down, you know, I'll join in.
[1:51:14.960 --> 1:51:18.800]  I mean, this is, when are we going to say enough is enough?
[1:51:18.800 --> 1:51:19.800]  Satan?
[1:51:19.800 --> 1:51:20.800]  Wow.
[1:51:20.800 --> 1:51:21.800]  Look at that.
[1:51:21.800 --> 1:51:23.360]  That can't be real.
[1:51:23.360 --> 1:51:25.560]  No, that's sold at Target.
[1:51:25.560 --> 1:51:30.880]  That's Summoned Demons for ages six to ten recommended, and they are teaching now in the
[1:51:30.880 --> 1:51:33.800]  Chicago schools, Satan time.
[1:51:33.800 --> 1:51:37.880]  Well, brother, I was at Borders Books.
[1:51:37.880 --> 1:51:38.880]  I love bookstores.
[1:51:38.880 --> 1:51:39.880]  I'm old fashioned.
[1:51:39.880 --> 1:51:41.400]  I love old record stores as well.
[1:51:41.400 --> 1:51:45.200]  And they had a whole section for kids about how to summon demons.
[1:51:45.200 --> 1:51:49.800]  And you know, Alex, you and I haven't talked about this, but Epstein and all this stuff
[1:51:49.800 --> 1:51:54.680]  and the Clintons and all of it, that island and the involvement with the children.
[1:51:54.680 --> 1:51:57.240]  See, I don't think it's a sexual thing.
[1:51:57.240 --> 1:52:00.200]  I've always thought it was, you know, you create a riff.
[1:52:00.200 --> 1:52:01.720]  You know enough about this stuff.
[1:52:01.720 --> 1:52:03.200]  You create a riff in a human being.
[1:52:03.200 --> 1:52:07.880]  You create a tear in their soul through trauma and then it allows the demonic in.
[1:52:07.880 --> 1:52:09.600]  So you have to invite this stuff in.
[1:52:09.600 --> 1:52:12.000]  We are protected by God.
[1:52:12.000 --> 1:52:13.240]  You have to allow this stuff in.
[1:52:13.240 --> 1:52:14.240]  You summon a demon.
[1:52:14.240 --> 1:52:15.240]  You've got it.
[1:52:15.240 --> 1:52:16.240]  You want a demon.
[1:52:16.240 --> 1:52:17.240]  You're going to get it.
[1:52:17.240 --> 1:52:18.240]  You want evil.
[1:52:18.240 --> 1:52:20.480]  Oh, man, you're going to get it.
[1:52:20.480 --> 1:52:21.480]  Believe me.
[1:52:21.480 --> 1:52:22.480]  I know.
[1:52:22.480 --> 1:52:23.480]  Wow.
[1:52:23.480 --> 1:52:28.560]  It's just it's so it's so crazy to like it's all here.
[1:52:28.560 --> 1:52:30.560]  It's all happening.
[1:52:30.560 --> 1:52:34.960]  Alex, I ribbed you.
[1:52:34.960 --> 1:52:36.120]  I tease you for years.
[1:52:36.120 --> 1:52:40.480]  We had we had great fun over the years.
[1:52:40.480 --> 1:52:42.360]  Are you tell the truth?
[1:52:42.360 --> 1:52:45.600]  Yeah, I'll tell you what I think.
[1:52:45.600 --> 1:52:48.520]  I'll tell you what I think about about you.
[1:52:48.520 --> 1:52:52.720]  You want to know I'm all ears, man cow.
[1:52:52.720 --> 1:52:55.680]  I was friends with Rush Limbaugh.
[1:52:55.680 --> 1:52:56.680]  We grew up in this.
[1:52:56.680 --> 1:53:00.800]  You know, we evolved in the same swamp there in the middle in the middle of America.
[1:53:00.800 --> 1:53:04.040]  And what the what the what the commies couldn't get because they don't have it.
[1:53:04.040 --> 1:53:05.720]  Stupid people don't have a sense of humor.
[1:53:05.720 --> 1:53:07.160]  They couldn't get his sense of humor.
[1:53:07.160 --> 1:53:13.440]  What I've always told people is you don't understand Jones is look, he's got to entertain
[1:53:13.440 --> 1:53:14.440]  you for hours.
[1:53:14.440 --> 1:53:15.720]  He has a sense of humor.
[1:53:15.720 --> 1:53:18.800]  I think some people don't understand that you have a sense of humor.
[1:53:18.800 --> 1:53:22.880]  I want to say that to hang out with you is a lot of laughs.
[1:53:22.880 --> 1:53:25.720]  I don't think people think that hanging out with Alex Jones would be a lot of laughs.
[1:53:25.720 --> 1:53:26.720]  I don't know what they think.
[1:53:26.720 --> 1:53:27.880]  I don't care.
[1:53:27.880 --> 1:53:34.520]  But you have a great sense of humor and and but I would have, I would bet at this point
[1:53:34.520 --> 1:53:36.120]  you wish you were wrong.
[1:53:36.120 --> 1:53:38.320]  Oh, I exactly.
[1:53:38.320 --> 1:53:41.520]  I don't feel vindicated even though we are, I feel just I'm in a nightmare.
[1:53:41.520 --> 1:53:43.320]  I mean, I mean, we're here.
[1:53:43.320 --> 1:53:46.320]  I wish I actually feel guilty and I can't stop.
[1:53:46.320 --> 1:53:48.080]  I feel like I didn't do enough, man.
[1:53:48.080 --> 1:53:49.080]  How how do you feel?
[1:53:49.080 --> 1:53:51.720]  Because you I mean, you say, oh, Alex, you were a trailblazer.
[1:53:51.720 --> 1:53:53.720]  You were covering all the big new world order topics.
[1:53:53.720 --> 1:53:55.120]  You know what's going on.
[1:53:55.120 --> 1:53:56.720]  You've been in a lot of big movies and TV shows.
[1:53:56.720 --> 1:53:59.040]  You know everybody and you you saw what's going on, Holly.
[1:53:59.040 --> 1:54:02.040]  When you were I was on your show 20 years ago, you were covering the same stuff.
[1:54:02.040 --> 1:54:05.600]  So what is it like to now be inside the real takeover?
[1:54:05.600 --> 1:54:10.920]  I mean, I'll ask you the same question back.
[1:54:10.920 --> 1:54:17.200]  Alex, people cannot even begin to imagine what you and I have gone through.
[1:54:17.200 --> 1:54:21.040]  You and I have talked about the, you know, the operations on, you know, just from from
[1:54:21.040 --> 1:54:22.040]  my radio station.
[1:54:22.040 --> 1:54:23.760]  And it may have been 20 years ago.
[1:54:23.760 --> 1:54:25.560]  They were telling people as they were resting them.
[1:54:25.560 --> 1:54:26.560]  I'm an American.
[1:54:26.560 --> 1:54:27.560]  The Constitution.
[1:54:27.560 --> 1:54:32.560]  I have rights training people how they're they're getting rid of our cops here in Chicago
[1:54:32.560 --> 1:54:34.800]  to get in a national police force.
[1:54:34.800 --> 1:54:36.000]  Obama talked about this.
[1:54:36.000 --> 1:54:40.480]  They don't want local cops that will give a hoot about you.
[1:54:40.480 --> 1:54:41.720]  The slavery that's coming.
[1:54:41.720 --> 1:54:42.920]  The ID that's coming.
[1:54:42.920 --> 1:54:45.720]  I'm talking to you on my phone, but you're not going to be able to buy yourself.
[1:54:45.720 --> 1:54:48.320]  You and I have read the last chapter of the Bible.
[1:54:48.320 --> 1:54:49.320]  We know how it ends.
[1:54:49.320 --> 1:54:51.480]  We know that God wins and good wins.
[1:54:51.480 --> 1:54:55.760]  But boy, do we have to, we have to go through hell to get there, literal hell.
[1:54:55.760 --> 1:55:01.760]  And the other thing is, the other thing I want to say to you is, yeah, yes, yes, I agree
[1:55:01.760 --> 1:55:02.760]  with you.
[1:55:02.760 --> 1:55:04.960]  And here's what you don't get.
[1:55:04.960 --> 1:55:12.560]  I bet you thought and I sure thought everything I said happened.
[1:55:12.560 --> 1:55:19.480]  Everything I said was going to happen happened, and do you think one person would say, wow,
[1:55:19.480 --> 1:55:22.200]  you called it, you were right.
[1:55:22.200 --> 1:55:23.200]  You were right.
[1:55:23.200 --> 1:55:28.400]  You think one person, all those callers, I started in 1984, do you think any of those
[1:55:28.400 --> 1:55:32.360]  callers have called up and said, I was wrong?
[1:55:32.360 --> 1:55:33.360]  Wow.
[1:55:33.360 --> 1:55:36.680]  No, no, they stick with it.
[1:55:36.680 --> 1:55:41.560]  Well, yeah, like just like the vaccine doesn't work and it makes people sick and then they
[1:55:41.560 --> 1:55:45.080]  say we're bad, that they're sick because we didn't take it.
[1:55:45.080 --> 1:55:50.400]  There's not even any logic there, but they just double down deeper into it.
[1:55:50.400 --> 1:55:58.480]  I got, I did a big time interview yesterday, got attacked, you know, the science, the science.
[1:55:58.480 --> 1:56:00.480]  And the guy said, are you vaccinated?
[1:56:00.480 --> 1:56:02.480]  I said, well, wait a minute, are you vaccinated?
[1:56:02.480 --> 1:56:03.480]  He goes, yes.
[1:56:03.480 --> 1:56:05.520]  I said, what if I'm not vaccinated?
[1:56:05.520 --> 1:56:08.200]  He said, well, I wouldn't feel safe.
[1:56:08.200 --> 1:56:09.480]  I said, wait, wait, wait.
[1:56:09.480 --> 1:56:12.280]  So that's a great vaccine you got.
[1:56:12.280 --> 1:56:15.880]  If I'm not vaccinated, you wouldn't want, no, he said, and I'd have you escorted out
[1:56:15.880 --> 1:56:16.880]  of the building.
[1:56:16.880 --> 1:56:22.040]  Wait a minute, that's some kind of great vaccine.
[1:56:22.040 --> 1:56:27.680]  And everybody I know that's gotten the boosters just gotten sick, it's, you know, you know.
[1:56:27.680 --> 1:56:30.200]  I have a family member to listen to me.
[1:56:30.200 --> 1:56:37.640]  Look about how the people that they're saying died of COVID had four other illnesses, 1%,
[1:56:37.640 --> 1:56:40.880]  I don't, I don't, I don't need to, you know all this, but you know, just, just to say
[1:56:40.880 --> 1:56:47.120]  it again for the 1 million time, what is it 1% may it make 1% it may have been COVID.
[1:56:47.120 --> 1:56:51.840]  Your kids have a better chance of drowning than they do have getting hurt from COVID.
[1:56:51.840 --> 1:56:56.600]  And the numbers are minus fuel and yet our kids are, are living in these center block
[1:56:56.600 --> 1:57:01.560]  prisons, getting brainwashed about how great communism is, how bad their skin color is.
[1:57:01.560 --> 1:57:05.000]  Well, here's the key point, do five more minutes with us and come back again sooner, come down
[1:57:05.000 --> 1:57:07.960]  to the studio, we'd love to fly you and your wife down here.
[1:57:07.960 --> 1:57:11.360]  We should go visit Roger soon, he's staying up with him for two weeks, but we come back
[1:57:11.360 --> 1:57:14.520]  and we'll do five more minutes with you because I want to talk about you're not doing this
[1:57:14.520 --> 1:57:15.840]  as a publicity stunt.
[1:57:15.840 --> 1:57:18.760]  I know some of the behind the scenes stuff, you probably know that I know.
[1:57:18.760 --> 1:57:23.360]  You are really intending to do this gubernatorial run and that's why they got your phones tapped
[1:57:23.360 --> 1:57:27.920]  obviously and what's going on there because once they have digital taps, but that's at
[1:57:27.920 --> 1:57:30.000]  the AT&T and SA level.
[1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:35.520]  When the local mob taps you, they go out to your control pole and look it up and they
[1:57:35.520 --> 1:57:38.400]  can get into the smart meter and they just set it to grab all your communications, that's
[1:57:38.400 --> 1:57:39.400]  how the tabs work now.
[1:57:39.400 --> 1:57:43.880]  So of course they got him tapped, they tapped Jesse Ventura's phone, that got confirmed
[1:57:43.880 --> 1:57:49.000]  when he ran for governor.
[1:57:49.000 --> 1:57:53.880]  Everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has only been the build up for what
[1:57:53.880 --> 1:57:55.840]  the globalists are doing right now.
[1:57:55.840 --> 1:57:59.880]  This is their big offensive, this is their takeover and this is the point that they're
[1:57:59.880 --> 1:58:03.000]  at their very weakest because now they've revealed themselves.
[1:58:03.000 --> 1:58:07.040]  Now they're a world government, they're permanent martial law, their medical tyranny is out
[1:58:07.040 --> 1:58:08.040]  in the open.
[1:58:08.040 --> 1:58:12.520]  Their depopulation agenda has been exposed, but they're using their corporate power and
[1:58:12.520 --> 1:58:16.800]  trillions to go across the planet and shut down people telling the truth.
[1:58:16.800 --> 1:58:20.200]  So listen Paul Revere's, when you spread the word about the broadcast, when you pray for
[1:58:20.200 --> 1:58:24.680]  the broadcast, you're the tip of the sphere and when you buy products at infowarstore.com
[1:58:24.680 --> 1:58:25.680]  you keep us on air.
[1:58:25.680 --> 1:58:29.040]  Plus, we've got great products that have been sold out for months that are back in stock

[1:58:36.680 --> 1:58:39.840]  two things you do for your body, it's these two products.
[1:58:39.840 --> 1:58:44.480]  They're all back in stock at infowarstore.com, 50% off and it keeps us on the air.
[1:58:44.480 --> 1:58:48.440]  Only way we fail is if you don't take action.
[1:58:48.440 --> 1:58:54.320]  I am recording this announcement on the afternoon of January 6th, 2022 and that means there
[1:58:54.320 --> 1:58:59.560]  are only seven days left of us being able to offer our best selling product, Vitamin
[1:58:59.560 --> 1:59:03.000]  Mineral Fusion at 50% off.
[1:59:03.000 --> 1:59:08.320]  It has all the vitamins, all the minerals, incredible amino acids, it is a game changer
[1:59:08.320 --> 1:59:13.120]  for your immune system and every other function in your body and it's a must have.
[1:59:13.120 --> 1:59:17.680]  That's why despite the fact that it's selling out in current sales rates, we're going to
[1:59:17.680 --> 1:59:22.000]  keep it on sale for another seven days.
[1:59:22.000 --> 1:59:26.960]  So we're running this until next Thursday and your purchase supports the broadcast.
[1:59:26.960 --> 1:59:31.200]  I want to thank you all for shopping with InfoWars, without you it would not have been
[1:59:31.200 --> 1:59:35.840]  on air and the world would be a much worse position right now than it's in.
[1:59:35.840 --> 1:59:40.320]  Thanks to you supporting InfoWars, we have now become the number one beacon of truth
[1:59:40.320 --> 1:59:43.120]  exposing the great reset and the new world order.
[1:59:43.120 --> 1:59:53.680]  So support your immune system and support free speech in the fight for liberty at the
[1:59:53.680 --> 2:00:20.960]  moment, you are the resistance.
[2:00:20.960 --> 2:00:40.360]  All right, in closing, Eric and Cal Muller running for Governor, Illinois.
[2:00:40.360 --> 2:00:42.040]  This is not a publicity stunt, is it?
[2:00:42.040 --> 2:00:46.320]  And he also had some Roger Stone comments there, but anything else you'd like to add?
[2:00:46.320 --> 2:00:47.800]  Great to have you here with us.
[2:00:47.800 --> 2:00:54.080]  No, this is not a stunt, of course, they chuckle at me, they chuckle at you, and then everything
[2:00:54.080 --> 2:00:56.320]  comes true.
[2:00:56.320 --> 2:00:59.360]  People are leaving, people are afraid to come here, I talk to people all over the world,
[2:00:59.360 --> 2:01:02.800]  we're going to change all that, we're going to make it a destination once again.
[2:01:02.800 --> 2:01:06.160]  You know, Alex, it occurred to me that you were kind of like John the Baptist at Tucker
[2:01:06.160 --> 2:01:07.160]  Carlson.
[2:01:07.160 --> 2:01:12.200]  Well, that, I mean, my job has been to wake up other people, I figured other men and women
[2:01:12.200 --> 2:01:13.600]  would see this in five bags.
[2:01:13.600 --> 2:01:16.160]  I think we both kind of been doing that.
[2:01:16.160 --> 2:01:20.880]  Yeah, these are perilous times, brother, I'm just telling you, and I know you've been
[2:01:20.880 --> 2:01:26.200]  going through it for years, and everyone listening and watching has gone through it, but the
[2:01:26.200 --> 2:01:29.960]  amount of, you know, you want to do something satanic, you want to do something X-rated,
[2:01:29.960 --> 2:01:30.960]  no problem.
[2:01:30.960 --> 2:01:37.480]  You put up a joke about Fauci or Jeffrey Epstein, and oh my God, it's the end of the world
[2:01:37.480 --> 2:01:38.480]  to the internet.
[2:01:38.480 --> 2:01:42.360]  This is really frightful times, so I hope more people stand up or we're going to be
[2:01:42.360 --> 2:01:47.120]  living in, we're going to be living in communism, a prison, a prison planet.
[2:01:47.120 --> 2:01:48.120]  I agree.
[2:01:48.120 --> 2:01:52.800]  So when is the gubernatorial election for folks that don't know in Illinois?
[2:01:52.800 --> 2:01:53.800]  Say that again.
[2:01:53.800 --> 2:01:56.640]  When is the gubernatorial date this November?
[2:01:56.640 --> 2:02:01.240]  Brother, I've long, you know, they're, I'm telling you, they were, at the minute I announced
[2:02:01.240 --> 2:02:03.840]  there were workers all around my house messing with the wires outside.
[2:02:03.840 --> 2:02:04.840]  I know, I hear you.
[2:02:04.840 --> 2:02:05.840]  I meant Cal.
[2:02:05.840 --> 2:02:10.360]  When is the, is the governor's race this year in November?
[2:02:10.360 --> 2:02:13.720]  Yes, I remember you well.
[2:02:13.720 --> 2:02:16.160]  I've known you for 20 years.
[2:02:16.160 --> 2:02:17.320]  This is hilarious.
[2:02:17.320 --> 2:02:18.600]  We got to get your ass in studio.
[2:02:18.600 --> 2:02:23.400]  You haven't been out in Austin a long time, and I should come up and see you there.
[2:02:23.400 --> 2:02:26.080]  The Illinois governor's race is this year, correct?
[2:02:26.080 --> 2:02:27.080]  Yes, sir.
[2:02:27.080 --> 2:02:28.080]  Yeah.
[2:02:28.080 --> 2:02:29.400]  Look, I'll see you there.
[2:02:29.400 --> 2:02:30.400]  I'll see you there.
[2:02:30.400 --> 2:02:31.400]  Yes.
[2:02:31.400 --> 2:02:32.400]  Absolutely.
[2:02:32.400 --> 2:02:35.080]  Take your ass with a feather, particularly nice weather.
[2:02:35.080 --> 2:02:36.480]  Yes, I hear you.
[2:02:36.480 --> 2:02:37.480]  All right.
[2:02:37.480 --> 2:02:38.480]  Yeah.
[2:02:38.480 --> 2:02:39.480]  Obviously we got major problems.
[2:02:39.480 --> 2:02:40.480]  That's technology.
[2:02:40.480 --> 2:02:41.480]  Got to work it out.
[2:02:41.480 --> 2:02:42.480]  All right.
[2:02:42.480 --> 2:02:43.640]  Well, man, Cal, good luck with the run.
[2:02:43.640 --> 2:02:45.160]  What's the website again?
[2:02:45.160 --> 2:02:48.160]  How do people find you running for governor?
[2:02:48.160 --> 2:02:53.120]  ManCalforGovernor.com and Alex, they, you know, they've, they've come after me a few
[2:02:53.120 --> 2:02:55.960]  times for being friends with you and I stand strong.
[2:02:55.960 --> 2:02:57.760]  Not all of our friends are perfect.
[2:02:57.760 --> 2:03:02.160]  You've probably been embarrassed by me a few times too, but I love you and I pray for
[2:03:02.160 --> 2:03:04.400]  you and I wish you good luck with everything.
[2:03:04.400 --> 2:03:05.400]  God bless.
[2:03:05.400 --> 2:03:06.400]  Absolutely.
[2:03:06.400 --> 2:03:08.760]  Just in closing, now that your audio is back, you can hear me.
[2:03:08.760 --> 2:03:09.760]  Now is Roger.
[2:03:09.760 --> 2:03:10.760]  You just spent two weeks with Roger Stone.
[2:03:10.760 --> 2:03:12.640]  He's a character, isn't he?
[2:03:12.640 --> 2:03:16.040]  You know, I just told you I didn't want to talk about that.
[2:03:16.040 --> 2:03:22.800]  Oh, because you guys, you, you know, Roger, no, no, I got to tell you because Roger and
[2:03:22.800 --> 2:03:24.280]  I joke about this.
[2:03:24.280 --> 2:03:27.280]  Alex, don't say this.
[2:03:27.280 --> 2:03:28.520]  And then of course you jump on.
[2:03:28.520 --> 2:03:29.520]  You have no filter.
[2:03:29.520 --> 2:03:30.800]  You have no filter.
[2:03:30.800 --> 2:03:31.800]  I love it about you.
[2:03:31.800 --> 2:03:32.800]  Yes.
[2:03:32.800 --> 2:03:33.960]  I went down to Florida to taste some freedom.
[2:03:33.960 --> 2:03:38.720]  I was trying to find our current governor, uh, governor, uh, Pugsley, uh, Dinsdale, Dinsdale,
[2:03:38.720 --> 2:03:42.920]  and, uh, I did a great video where I was looking for him around, uh, Mar-a-Lago and
[2:03:42.920 --> 2:03:45.720]  all the other places that, that our governor likes to hang out.
[2:03:45.720 --> 2:03:51.200]  And yeah, I did see Roger Stone and Kristen Davis and, and, uh, uh, uh, Karen Turk, who
[2:03:51.200 --> 2:03:56.200]  you should have on your show and, and, uh, Lisa Loomer and all, all kinds of local folks.
[2:03:56.200 --> 2:03:59.040]  And we just, we just, an old friend of yours, um, I can't remember his name.
[2:03:59.040 --> 2:04:03.840]  Anyway, I just had a great time smoking cigars, hanging out with a Cuban community in Florida.
[2:04:03.840 --> 2:04:06.920]  Brother, you want to talk about Patriots.
[2:04:06.920 --> 2:04:07.920]  And they love you.
[2:04:07.920 --> 2:04:11.880]  And Cal, you said you didn't want to get into was Roger involved in your campaign.
[2:04:11.880 --> 2:04:13.280]  You shoot videos with him.
[2:04:13.280 --> 2:04:14.720]  Everybody knows you've been in Florida.
[2:04:14.720 --> 2:04:15.880]  So I don't give up sources.
[2:04:15.880 --> 2:04:17.080]  That's not what happened here.
[2:04:17.080 --> 2:04:23.960]  No, no, no, Alex, Alex, the reason, the reason I, the reason I didn't want to talk about
[2:04:23.960 --> 2:04:29.280]  it is he's not my campaign manager and I am running for governor and then, oh, he met
[2:04:29.280 --> 2:04:30.280]  with stone.
[2:04:30.280 --> 2:04:31.280]  Oh, and now I got it.
[2:04:31.280 --> 2:04:33.600]  I was just asking how's Roger and his wife doing?
[2:04:33.600 --> 2:04:34.600]  Holy hell.
[2:04:34.600 --> 2:04:40.000]  No, but I'm just telling you my reality living here in the prison state of Illinois.
[2:04:40.000 --> 2:04:42.120]  Now, and they don't have to print the truth.
[2:04:42.120 --> 2:04:43.600]  Now he's my campaign manager.
[2:04:43.600 --> 2:04:44.600]  I met with him for two weeks.
[2:04:44.600 --> 2:04:46.360]  Hey, listen, great interview.
[2:04:46.360 --> 2:04:50.680]  What is that little creature on the top shelf that is brown, a little yellow arms?
[2:04:50.680 --> 2:04:55.080]  What is that creature up there?
[2:04:55.080 --> 2:04:56.080]  This thing?
[2:04:56.080 --> 2:04:57.080]  Yeah.
[2:04:57.080 --> 2:05:04.640]  Christmas 2021 is over, but you still got a really great chance to give yourself the
[2:05:04.640 --> 2:05:09.280]  gift of free speech and liberty and freedom into the new year, all at the same time, making

[2:05:57.440 --> 2:06:00.440]  Thanks for keeping us on the air.
[2:06:00.440 --> 2:06:12.840]  The answer to 1984 is 1776 live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[2:06:12.840 --> 2:06:26.760]  Alex Jones, all right, we have a Oathkeeper whistleblower joining us and my whistleblower,
[2:06:26.760 --> 2:06:30.880]  they're blowing the whistle on what they saw, what concerned them, what was going on.
[2:06:30.880 --> 2:06:32.880]  We know feds were involved provocaturing the event.
[2:06:32.880 --> 2:06:38.560]  We know Oathkeepers is just full of great veterans and military and current police that
[2:06:38.560 --> 2:06:39.560]  they do follow their oaths.
[2:06:39.560 --> 2:06:43.800]  And I never thought Stuart Rhodes was the Fed.
[2:06:43.800 --> 2:06:47.360]  I haven't told people here privately, I'm like, well, obviously the feds infiltrated
[2:06:47.360 --> 2:06:48.360]  January six.
[2:06:48.360 --> 2:06:49.360]  We know who they are.
[2:06:49.360 --> 2:06:50.360]  They got caught a bunch of them.
[2:06:50.360 --> 2:06:55.080]  But I said, you know, I didn't hear Stuart saying that he was going to, you know, try
[2:06:55.080 --> 2:06:59.480]  to engage in an attempt to trigger a civil war.
[2:06:59.480 --> 2:07:03.120]  But if you read the indictment that I've got right here, we're going to cover this more
[2:07:03.120 --> 2:07:06.880]  coming up with a special guest who was in Oathkeepers and got out of right before the
[2:07:06.880 --> 2:07:10.920]  saw went down because he saw some disturbing things.
[2:07:10.920 --> 2:07:11.920]  This is crazy.
[2:07:11.920 --> 2:07:15.240]  Now, I saw him make stuff about Owen at a whole cloth.
[2:07:15.240 --> 2:07:22.920]  So if they, this is Stephen King level fiction, if it's not true, this is unbelievable.
[2:07:22.920 --> 2:07:29.560]  And so if there was an element of citizens doing this, and it wasn't just the feds running
[2:07:29.560 --> 2:07:34.080]  all of the behavior, then I'll say it, I might like the feds.
[2:07:34.080 --> 2:07:35.280]  I don't lie on purpose.
[2:07:35.280 --> 2:07:40.520]  I make mistakes, but I'm not, I'm not up here trying to have a civil war with the federal
[2:07:40.520 --> 2:07:41.520]  government.
[2:07:41.520 --> 2:07:47.560]  I'm not trying to be the leader and play army in the backyard, but it's not just Stuart
[2:07:47.560 --> 2:07:51.760]  Rhodes of this indictment that's right that's playing army.
[2:07:51.760 --> 2:07:56.400]  It's the federal government and these agencies are really trying to start a civil war.
[2:07:56.400 --> 2:08:00.200]  So here's, here's, here's what I want to say when I get the other news.
[2:08:00.200 --> 2:08:11.400]  I'm not saying that Stuart Rhodes was actually trying to overthrow what they saw as legitimate
[2:08:11.400 --> 2:08:16.560]  government because I can't believe anything these people say or do.
[2:08:16.560 --> 2:08:20.960]  But if we do find out it's true, it's wrong, what happened?
[2:08:20.960 --> 2:08:26.480]  That said, I have a giant stack of news right here from yesterday and today, five inches
[2:08:26.480 --> 2:08:37.360]  tall of Biden and General Milley and Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters and just Hillary
[2:08:37.360 --> 2:08:38.360]  Clinton.
[2:08:38.360 --> 2:08:44.000]  I mean, all of them saying we're in a civil war, we're going to have to arrest millions
[2:08:44.000 --> 2:08:49.000]  of people and put them in camps and we got to lock up all the unvaccinated to, and they're
[2:08:49.000 --> 2:08:52.360]  just trying to get the idea that they can just start arresting everybody because they
[2:08:52.360 --> 2:08:58.440]  know they were about to plunge the economy and bring in this whole globalist system.
[2:08:58.440 --> 2:09:04.680]  So this is going to screw over everybody and imagine that people wouldn't have followed
[2:09:04.680 --> 2:09:10.160]  Lenin's orders in the first days of the Soviet Union or people wouldn't have followed Hitler's
[2:09:10.160 --> 2:09:14.840]  orders in Nazi Germany early on.
[2:09:14.840 --> 2:09:21.040]  And so I'm not going to be tricked into just being an enemy of everybody in corporations
[2:09:21.040 --> 2:09:25.800]  or everybody in the government, but they're people like us.
[2:09:25.800 --> 2:09:28.480]  And they're compartmentalized, though.
[2:09:28.480 --> 2:09:32.920]  The good people are on the bottom, the people that follow orders are in the middle, and
[2:09:32.920 --> 2:09:36.760]  the people that are really bad news are at the top now.
[2:09:36.760 --> 2:09:39.920]  And so this is a big deal.
[2:09:39.920 --> 2:09:47.400]  And they are publicly branding the American people as terrorists and setting up new agencies
[2:09:47.400 --> 2:09:49.120]  to deal with the American threat.
[2:09:49.120 --> 2:09:53.200]  And when your own government turns inward, it says, the public's the main threat.
[2:09:53.200 --> 2:09:57.800]  You know you're in a banana republic.
[2:09:57.800 --> 2:10:03.480]  And then I've got all the articles, mainstream news going, yeah, the Pentagon scared you
[2:10:03.480 --> 2:10:08.800]  and used mass psychology, which is the same thing as mass hysteria, which is the same
[2:10:08.800 --> 2:10:10.720]  thing as mass formation psychosis.
[2:10:10.720 --> 2:10:15.320]  But we're still going to try to ban Joe Rogan because he talked about it.
[2:10:15.320 --> 2:10:17.240]  I covered that in the first hour.
[2:10:17.240 --> 2:10:23.560]  Brain news, headlines, yeah, Financial Times of London, Washington Post, yeah, yeah, we're
[2:10:23.560 --> 2:10:27.880]  brainwashing it, but you know, it's good for you.
[2:10:27.880 --> 2:10:33.840]  And if you say it exists, it doesn't exist.
[2:10:33.840 --> 2:10:42.320]  Now the average person brought up to conform, when their brain swallows that, it begins
[2:10:42.320 --> 2:10:51.480]  to create the node, or like the toehold on which the psychosis grows.
[2:10:51.480 --> 2:10:56.800]  If you didn't use psychology terms all day, but let's just say mental illness, delusions,
[2:10:56.800 --> 2:10:58.320]  this comes out of things like that.
[2:10:58.320 --> 2:11:02.440]  Yeah, of course we're scaring you with Pentagon technology and lying to you, but it's very
[2:11:02.440 --> 2:11:03.440]  good.
[2:11:03.440 --> 2:11:07.680]  And plus, oh, but no one's lying to you to create mass psychosis, but we are.
[2:11:07.680 --> 2:11:09.920]  But it's good, but it doesn't happen.
[2:11:09.920 --> 2:11:10.920]  But it's good.
[2:11:10.920 --> 2:11:13.280]  So see, they're trying to tell you, right, just accept that it's good.
[2:11:13.280 --> 2:11:15.920]  But if it isn't good, I'm going to be mean to you.
[2:11:15.920 --> 2:11:19.600]  So just say two plus two equals five.
[2:11:19.600 --> 2:11:22.800]  And next week I'll tell you it equals seven, and tomorrow I'll tell you it equals four,
[2:11:22.800 --> 2:11:26.160]  and the next day I'll tell you it equals zero.
[2:11:26.160 --> 2:11:31.560]  You're not going to have any analytic thoughts in your little head.
[2:11:31.560 --> 2:11:38.120]  You're just going to receive what I say like you're a pass through circuit.
[2:11:38.120 --> 2:11:40.400]  You're not a sentient being with consciousness.
[2:11:40.400 --> 2:11:43.560]  You're not a sentient being with free will.
[2:11:43.560 --> 2:11:52.520]  You are somebody that we are going to just sit here and program.
[2:11:52.520 --> 2:11:53.520]  And how's that?
[2:11:53.520 --> 2:11:55.120]  Well, I don't want to be programmed.
[2:11:55.120 --> 2:11:56.120]  Nobody's programming.
[2:11:56.120 --> 2:11:57.880]  But you just said you're going to program it.
[2:11:57.880 --> 2:12:00.280]  Well, if you accept the programming, it exists, and it's good.
[2:12:00.280 --> 2:12:03.080]  If you say it is bad, it doesn't exist.
[2:12:03.080 --> 2:12:06.640]  And they're doing that out on the open like, oh, the vaccine totally works.
[2:12:06.640 --> 2:12:07.640]  That's why it doesn't work.
[2:12:07.640 --> 2:12:08.640]  You got to have more.
[2:12:08.640 --> 2:12:11.520]  So those that don't take it are the reason you're sick.
[2:12:11.520 --> 2:12:13.320]  All that is flying in the face of logic.
[2:12:13.320 --> 2:12:15.320]  And you say, well, why do they do it?
[2:12:15.320 --> 2:12:17.240]  Why do they file all these things?
[2:12:17.240 --> 2:12:20.720]  I've read dozens of these indictments and gone and checked the cases.
[2:12:20.720 --> 2:12:21.960]  It's literal.
[2:12:21.960 --> 2:12:26.920]  Like you read it, you're like, huh, what, what, what, what, like, you know it's not true.
[2:12:26.920 --> 2:12:29.360]  Owen Shroyer went in the Capitol, beat people up.
[2:12:29.360 --> 2:12:32.360]  Owen Shroyer does not work in info wars.
[2:12:32.360 --> 2:12:36.560]  Owen Shroyer was not with Alex Jones on January 6th when Alex Jones tried to stop the riot.
[2:12:36.560 --> 2:12:37.560]  It says that.
[2:12:37.560 --> 2:12:38.920]  He's with us.
[2:12:38.920 --> 2:12:40.720]  They're bullhorning people trying to stop them.
[2:12:40.720 --> 2:12:42.480]  He's with me the whole time.
[2:12:42.480 --> 2:12:44.320]  And they, they file in front of a judge.
[2:12:44.320 --> 2:12:47.200]  And then imagine if you're in front of the judge like, oh, and how do you even sit there
[2:12:47.200 --> 2:12:52.280]  with a straight face with some weird, weirdo and a black outfit sitting there when you've
[2:12:52.280 --> 2:12:55.800]  given them the video files and they go, I'm not going to look at those.
[2:12:55.800 --> 2:13:00.160]  I'm just going to rely on the state.
[2:13:00.160 --> 2:13:01.160]  They said that.
[2:13:01.160 --> 2:13:03.000]  We're like, oh, our lawyers really attacked.
[2:13:03.000 --> 2:13:04.240]  They're like, this is a lie.
[2:13:04.240 --> 2:13:05.240]  We have all these lies.
[2:13:05.240 --> 2:13:06.440]  We have all none of this is true.
[2:13:06.440 --> 2:13:07.640]  He works in info wars.
[2:13:07.640 --> 2:13:10.920]  The judge goes, no, he doesn't.
[2:13:10.920 --> 2:13:14.760]  Your trial goes forward years in prison for attacking the Capitol.
[2:13:14.760 --> 2:13:21.600]  I mean, so like when you're faced with that level of gaslighting, what are they trying
[2:13:21.600 --> 2:13:24.120]  to do?
[2:13:24.120 --> 2:13:25.960]  I'll tell you what they're trying to do.
[2:13:25.960 --> 2:13:29.960]  It's big, powerful, rich families that are inbred and crazy that are just giving orders
[2:13:29.960 --> 2:13:33.240]  to people that run things to do this.
[2:13:33.240 --> 2:13:34.440]  And it's going to explode.
[2:13:34.440 --> 2:13:36.280]  It's going to just, it's already happening.
[2:13:36.280 --> 2:13:42.520]  Everything's breaking down, the supply chain's breaking down, everything's going to hell.
[2:13:42.520 --> 2:13:47.960]  And it's all because people don't have morals.
[2:13:47.960 --> 2:13:55.480]  If the average person said no to this, if these judges looked at these things and said,
[2:13:55.480 --> 2:13:56.480]  this isn't true.
[2:13:56.480 --> 2:13:57.480]  You're lying.
[2:13:57.480 --> 2:13:58.480]  You're in trouble.
[2:13:58.480 --> 2:14:02.000]  The FBI and the Justice Department wouldn't do it.
[2:14:02.000 --> 2:14:06.000]  And you look at these FBI agents and these Justice Department people and like you want
[2:14:06.000 --> 2:14:09.520]  to think of America as strong and upright people and you want to believe in things and
[2:14:09.520 --> 2:14:14.760]  you look at them, they're like little oily lawyers and like, because I've been around
[2:14:14.760 --> 2:14:16.520]  these people and you're like, what the hell?
[2:14:16.520 --> 2:14:22.040]  This is the opposite of like, imagine G-Men, you know, on TV in the 1960s or something.
[2:14:22.040 --> 2:14:23.720]  Because they are the opposite folks.
[2:14:23.720 --> 2:14:24.960]  Those G-Men weren't perfect.
[2:14:24.960 --> 2:14:26.320]  Everything political's got problems.
[2:14:26.320 --> 2:14:29.640]  These are really bad people.
[2:14:29.640 --> 2:14:30.640]  And they know that.
[2:14:30.640 --> 2:14:33.840]  And there's the shame of who they are and the shame of how they lie.
[2:14:33.840 --> 2:14:38.680]  If they just go ahead and lie, they'll get promoted up the chain.
[2:14:38.680 --> 2:14:46.360]  Oh, but if you don't lie, well, you'll just be fired or you'll be, it's just, it's a nightmare.
[2:14:46.360 --> 2:14:53.640]  And it's all about a system for the devil to train us to sell ourselves out.
[2:14:53.640 --> 2:15:00.240]  We believe to get ahead, but you don't get ahead by serving these people.
[2:15:00.240 --> 2:15:01.240]  Oh, what?
[2:15:01.240 --> 2:15:04.360]  You get a bigger house maybe for a while and then your kid dies of fentanyl?
[2:15:04.360 --> 2:15:08.320]  I mean, seriously, I read about these globalists and I read about their lives.
[2:15:08.320 --> 2:15:11.400]  They have the richest ones, have the worst lives.
[2:15:11.400 --> 2:15:14.120]  Like you look at top globalists, almost all their kids commit suicide.
[2:15:14.120 --> 2:15:17.360]  That's why globalists have stopped having children.
[2:15:17.360 --> 2:15:20.840]  Almost every EU leader, I think one EU leader in 35 countries has kids.
[2:15:20.840 --> 2:15:21.840]  It's a cult.
[2:15:21.840 --> 2:15:24.800]  Because if you have kids, you actually care about the future.
[2:15:24.800 --> 2:15:29.200]  But like the Duponts and all of them, like almost all their kids end up in mental institutions
[2:15:29.200 --> 2:15:37.640]  or committing suicide because they have sold out their country and their people and everybody
[2:15:37.640 --> 2:15:44.160]  else and they're just these demonic, hateful, ravenous animals that want to dominate and
[2:15:44.160 --> 2:15:46.120]  control on access to your children.
[2:15:46.120 --> 2:15:50.480]  That's the one thing Alexander Soros wants is access to your children.
[2:15:50.480 --> 2:15:57.840]  And if I got to go to prison or get killed to expose him, I'll do it.
[2:15:57.840 --> 2:16:06.760]  Three very important life-saving words, vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and you find them all
[2:16:06.760 --> 2:16:13.840]  in vitamin, mineral, fusion, all the essential vitamins, all the essential minerals from really
[2:16:13.840 --> 2:16:21.520]  good, high-quality, absorbable sources and a bunch of key compounds, amino acids known
[2:16:21.520 --> 2:16:25.520]  to help get the nutrients into your tissues, into your cells.
[2:16:25.520 --> 2:16:28.800]  And despite the fact that the product is going to sell out in the next week or so, we're
[2:16:28.800 --> 2:16:34.480]  going to keep it on sale at 50% off for another seven days.
[2:16:34.480 --> 2:16:39.800]  So again, I am cutting this announcement on the afternoon of January 6, 2022.
[2:16:39.800 --> 2:16:44.040]  We're going to run this for a week and then we are going to be selling out of this product.
[2:16:44.040 --> 2:16:47.760]  Hopefully more comes in in the next month or so because it's the best seller.
[2:16:47.760 --> 2:16:50.600]  And it's something everybody needs for their immune system and their body.
[2:16:50.600 --> 2:16:57.840]  Get your vitamin, mineral, fusion now and support the InfoWare 360 win at InfoWareStore.com.
[2:16:57.840 --> 2:17:07.480]  The COVID-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience, a symbol of slavery, a symbol of the chains
[2:17:07.480 --> 2:17:11.880]  that the medical tyranny combined controlled by the global private corporations has put
[2:17:11.880 --> 2:17:12.880]  in place.
[2:17:12.880 --> 2:17:18.400]  It is the symbol of the permanent emergency from which we will never emerge.
[2:17:18.400 --> 2:17:23.880]  It is the symbol that we are diseased and evil and bad and must cover our diseased criminal
[2:17:23.880 --> 2:17:26.720]  faces from the light of the sun.
[2:17:26.720 --> 2:17:34.960]  It is the symbol of our complete and total absolute surrender to evil.
[2:17:34.960 --> 2:17:39.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are crossing the Rubicon now.
[2:17:39.400 --> 2:17:42.400]  The entire future destiny of humanity is upon us.
[2:17:42.400 --> 2:17:46.280]  Klaus Schwab and the UN admit they're coming out with implantable microchips as part of
[2:17:46.280 --> 2:17:48.520]  the World ID and Carbon Taxes.
[2:17:48.520 --> 2:17:51.280]  Things only get worse from here if we submit.
[2:17:51.280 --> 2:17:57.120]  They only get better if we resist and say no, noncompliance, noncompliance, noncompliance.
[2:17:57.120 --> 2:18:00.000]  UN-run contact tracers aren't coming.
[2:18:00.000 --> 2:18:05.160]  They're here all over the world from Australia to the United States from Canada to Germany.
[2:18:05.160 --> 2:18:08.640]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do everywhere you go and then coming to your
[2:18:08.640 --> 2:18:14.360]  house and threatening in some cases actually taking people away into the night to their
[2:18:14.360 --> 2:18:15.360]  facilities.
[2:18:15.360 --> 2:18:19.800]  And they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process where they come
[2:18:19.800 --> 2:18:24.080]  and take, quote, healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[2:18:24.080 --> 2:18:25.880]  This is nothing less than martial law.
[2:18:25.880 --> 2:18:30.120]  And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages, many
[2:18:30.120 --> 2:18:34.400]  of which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning U.S. government military
[2:18:34.400 --> 2:18:37.000]  grade at InfowarsStore.com.

[2:18:57.680 --> 2:19:02.480]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist.
[2:19:02.480 --> 2:19:04.520]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[2:19:04.520 --> 2:19:10.240]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[2:19:10.240 --> 2:19:11.240]  But we failed.
[2:19:11.240 --> 2:19:12.680]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[2:19:12.680 --> 2:19:17.520]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat-footed, but they are going ahead with their full
[2:19:17.520 --> 2:19:20.840]  operational deindustrialization great reset.
[2:19:20.840 --> 2:19:25.160]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody
[2:19:25.160 --> 2:19:29.760]  they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[2:19:29.760 --> 2:19:32.800]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda, but
[2:19:32.800 --> 2:19:34.800]  we've also got to get personally prepared.
[2:19:34.800 --> 2:19:38.120]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storeable food, we've got the
[2:19:38.120 --> 2:19:42.600]  best food ready to ship at very affordable prices at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:19:42.600 --> 2:19:46.600]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready
[2:19:46.600 --> 2:19:48.000]  to ship right now.
[2:19:48.000 --> 2:19:53.160]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines and waits.
[2:19:53.160 --> 2:19:55.440]  Because believe me, serious times are coming.
[2:19:55.440 --> 2:19:59.120]  Get ready at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:19:59.120 --> 2:20:10.120]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:10.120 --> 2:20:27.360]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[2:20:27.360 --> 2:20:33.480]  It is now mainstream news and confirmed that the Justice Department and the White House
[2:20:33.480 --> 2:20:38.040]  have sent letters out to the school board saying we want you to ask for FBI assistance
[2:20:38.040 --> 2:20:42.160]  and that's how they generated the letter in Virginia and others saying terrorists are
[2:20:42.160 --> 2:20:43.160]  here.
[2:20:43.160 --> 2:20:44.160]  We want you to arrest the parents.
[2:20:44.160 --> 2:20:46.560]  We think people protesting us is illegal.
[2:20:46.560 --> 2:20:50.400]  Is the Justice Department wants to open up a front not with the Russians, not with the
[2:20:50.400 --> 2:20:54.480]  Chinese, not with radical Islam, not with the open borders and human traffickers.
[2:20:54.480 --> 2:20:59.880]  They work with them, but with parents because they're main targets, the children.
[2:20:59.880 --> 2:21:05.560]  I mean, that's really an evil occupied government, but again, all of that's done to discredit
[2:21:05.560 --> 2:21:08.240]  the government and discredit our institutions.
[2:21:08.240 --> 2:21:10.000]  That's not the US government.
[2:21:10.000 --> 2:21:12.760]  That's hijackers that have taken the country over.
[2:21:12.760 --> 2:21:18.440]  If somebody hijacks an airplane and pulls a gun out and takes over the cockpit and makes
[2:21:18.440 --> 2:21:26.680]  the pilot take off his uniform and the hijacker puts it on, that's not American Airlines pilot.
[2:21:26.680 --> 2:21:28.760]  That's a hijacker.
[2:21:28.760 --> 2:21:33.040]  So I'm not even defending institutions that are horrible, they're out of control, but
[2:21:33.040 --> 2:21:36.760]  the globalists want to fully destroy them because then they're going to bring in real
[2:21:36.760 --> 2:21:38.160]  tyranny on their ashes.
[2:21:38.160 --> 2:21:41.360]  And if you think our institutions and our police and stuff have problems now, you ain't
[2:21:41.360 --> 2:21:44.960]  seen nothing yet.
[2:21:44.960 --> 2:21:49.520]  And they hire a bunch of followers to get into their system that think they're winning
[2:21:49.520 --> 2:21:54.040]  and look at a one-dimensional goal, but if they extrapolate it out, it's the total collapse
[2:21:54.040 --> 2:21:56.440]  of society.
[2:21:56.440 --> 2:21:58.680]  Now I'm not here to bash Stuart Rhodes.
[2:21:58.680 --> 2:22:01.640]  I've known Stuart 12, 13 years since he founded Oathkeepers.
[2:22:01.640 --> 2:22:09.840]  He was a lawyer, worked for Ron Paul's congressional office and was a great guy we would have on.
[2:22:09.840 --> 2:22:15.080]  And I told people when they were saying folks think he's a fed, I said, I just really don't
[2:22:15.080 --> 2:22:16.840]  think Stuart's a fed.
[2:22:16.840 --> 2:22:21.720]  And I didn't hear Stuart or anybody say they wanted to overthrow stuff on January 6th because
[2:22:21.720 --> 2:22:26.080]  he'd been around some of DC, we saw him some.
[2:22:26.080 --> 2:22:32.040]  And I read last night and this morning twice the 40-something page indictment of he and
[2:22:32.040 --> 2:22:33.840]  10 others.
[2:22:33.840 --> 2:22:35.360]  And I don't know if this is true.
[2:22:35.360 --> 2:22:40.600]  I know Tucker Carlson had one of the indicted people on who's very credible, who's a retired
[2:22:40.600 --> 2:22:42.880]  Navy commander disabled.
[2:22:42.880 --> 2:22:45.640]  And if he didn't have a boat, he's not in these messages.
[2:22:45.640 --> 2:22:46.720]  It's not true.
[2:22:46.720 --> 2:22:50.520]  And he says they just make it up and put fake stuff in here.
[2:22:50.520 --> 2:22:53.880]  Now I wouldn't believe that because that's reckless and crazy, except they did it to
[2:22:53.880 --> 2:22:56.240]  Owen Schreuer.
[2:22:56.240 --> 2:23:00.280]  And I looked at other cases where you're reading something that isn't just partly a
[2:23:00.280 --> 2:23:03.120]  lie, the whole thing's a lie.
[2:23:03.120 --> 2:23:07.520]  And it doesn't probably explain this to the government.
[2:23:07.520 --> 2:23:09.680]  You scare me but not in the way you think.
[2:23:09.680 --> 2:23:13.000]  Like, I really care about my children in the country and the world in the future.
[2:23:13.000 --> 2:23:14.000]  You people are nuts.
[2:23:14.000 --> 2:23:18.320]  I mean, the Nazis just went and grabbed people and killed them.
[2:23:18.320 --> 2:23:24.720]  You guys literally go before judges and publish stuff that none of it's true.
[2:23:24.720 --> 2:23:29.760]  And that's why we don't believe anything you say.
[2:23:29.760 --> 2:23:33.120]  So why do you, like, who gives these orders?
[2:23:33.120 --> 2:23:39.240]  Like, oh, you're going to be promoted because you're going to go say Owen Schreuer attacked
[2:23:39.240 --> 2:23:41.240]  people inside the Capitol.
[2:23:41.240 --> 2:23:42.240]  So we're going to go to our guests.
[2:23:42.240 --> 2:23:45.000]  He'll be with us a little bit at the next hour and then Norm Patas is going to come
[2:23:45.000 --> 2:23:47.080]  in here to head a bunch of the other news is taking place.
[2:23:47.080 --> 2:23:49.640]  This is serious stuff.
[2:23:49.640 --> 2:23:53.840]  And when the FBI comes and visits you, they give you an anti-terrorism card and they tell
[2:23:53.840 --> 2:23:58.160]  you your organization is under investigation as a terrorist group.
[2:23:58.160 --> 2:24:02.320]  I mean, it's just, it's like, you want to laugh at it, but it's not funny.
[2:24:02.320 --> 2:24:06.680]  And it's the end of this country.
[2:24:06.680 --> 2:24:10.360]  And people say, oh, Alex, how are you taking it?
[2:24:10.360 --> 2:24:17.960]  Like the people that try to go to school boards and they protest critical race theory.
[2:24:17.960 --> 2:24:22.080]  I mean, can you imagine something more evil and antithetical to the Christian ethos and
[2:24:22.080 --> 2:24:24.600]  what America is based on?
[2:24:24.600 --> 2:24:27.480]  Then to say white people are inherently bad.
[2:24:27.480 --> 2:24:32.400]  And then to teach five year olds and up, they're bad because of their skin color.
[2:24:32.400 --> 2:24:34.560]  That destroys people's self-confidence.
[2:24:34.560 --> 2:24:35.560]  That hurts them.
[2:24:35.560 --> 2:24:36.560]  And what?
[2:24:36.560 --> 2:24:41.880]  Did white people did something mean to black people before this person's guilty?
[2:24:41.880 --> 2:24:46.320]  Because somebody looks like me a hundred years ago and did something that I'm in trouble.
[2:24:46.320 --> 2:24:48.960]  That is so evil, folks.
[2:24:48.960 --> 2:24:50.400]  But that isn't being run by black people.
[2:24:50.400 --> 2:24:52.200]  They get a few black races up there pushing it.
[2:24:52.200 --> 2:24:53.700]  It's run by the social engineers.
[2:24:53.700 --> 2:24:56.360]  It's run by the bad guys to turn us against each other.
[2:24:56.360 --> 2:24:57.600]  They're like, well, what do we do now?
[2:24:57.600 --> 2:25:02.720]  I'm just take white people's health care away and tell them black folks are better than them.
[2:25:02.720 --> 2:25:05.880]  And that they're inherently bad and teach them.
[2:25:05.880 --> 2:25:09.080]  But I love Americans of every race, color, and creed.
[2:25:09.080 --> 2:25:10.160]  They see right through this.
[2:25:10.160 --> 2:25:13.280]  And that's why the Justice Department's panicking because they're not a Justice Department.
[2:25:13.280 --> 2:25:18.360]  They're social engineers that have hijacked it and gotten control of it that are literally
[2:25:18.360 --> 2:25:19.360]  member first.
[2:25:19.360 --> 2:25:20.360]  Oh, we're not teaching that.
[2:25:20.360 --> 2:25:21.360]  Oh, really?
[2:25:21.360 --> 2:25:25.360]  Here's the syllabus.
[2:25:25.360 --> 2:25:27.480]  Teaching children, oh, the devil doesn't exist.
[2:25:27.480 --> 2:25:28.480]  God doesn't exist.
[2:25:28.480 --> 2:25:35.360]  But you have original sin because of your color.
[2:25:35.360 --> 2:25:39.880]  You know, in the Koran, it says that blacks committed sin or whatever in their line so
[2:25:39.880 --> 2:25:42.080]  they deserve to be slaves.
[2:25:42.080 --> 2:25:46.560]  And then whites picked that up in the transatlantic slave trade 500 years ago from the Arabic slave
[2:25:46.560 --> 2:25:47.560]  trade.
[2:25:47.560 --> 2:25:51.840]  It's on record and said, well, we'll say they're from Ham and that it was a cursed line.
[2:25:51.840 --> 2:25:55.200]  That's black people, Ham.
[2:25:55.200 --> 2:26:01.520]  Like a Middle Eastern group, the point is that that stuff all comes from there.
[2:26:01.520 --> 2:26:06.400]  And so you take something about original sin saying black people have the mark of cane
[2:26:06.400 --> 2:26:11.120]  on them from a twisted interpretation of the Bible.
[2:26:11.120 --> 2:26:16.280]  And because that was done 600 years ago, you now do that to people today, five-year-old
[2:26:16.280 --> 2:26:17.280]  children.
[2:26:17.280 --> 2:26:22.720]  And, of course, it's come out and so we'll go to break and come back with our guests.
[2:26:22.720 --> 2:26:23.720]  I appreciate being there.
[2:26:23.720 --> 2:26:26.800]  He's taking care of a sick family member right now, so he's on the phone.
[2:26:26.800 --> 2:26:29.200]  We really appreciate John D. Shirley coming on.
[2:26:29.200 --> 2:26:30.640]  We'll have a little bit in the next hour, as I said.
[2:26:30.640 --> 2:26:35.480]  I wanted to fill you in on the level of the Seville.
[2:26:35.480 --> 2:26:39.320]  So people ask me, Alex, how are you taking it?
[2:26:39.320 --> 2:26:42.880]  Well, we're being destroyed.
[2:26:42.880 --> 2:26:43.880]  We're on fire.
[2:26:43.880 --> 2:26:45.520]  They poured gas on me, honestly.
[2:26:45.520 --> 2:26:49.640]  But when I look at how I'm under attack, I look at the house and it's on fire.
[2:26:49.640 --> 2:26:51.480]  I look at my country, it's on fire.
[2:26:51.480 --> 2:26:52.480]  The world's on fire.
[2:26:52.480 --> 2:26:54.840]  We're all under this attack.
[2:26:54.840 --> 2:26:56.960]  I'm just somebody trying to fight this.
[2:26:56.960 --> 2:26:58.800]  So John D. Shirley, let me introduce him.
[2:26:58.800 --> 2:27:00.120]  We'll go to break and come back to him.
[2:27:00.120 --> 2:27:04.840]  He spent 20 years with the Houston Police Department before retiring and later being
[2:27:04.840 --> 2:27:10.160]  appointed and then reelected as the constable of Hood County, Texas, Precinct 2.
[2:27:10.160 --> 2:27:14.440]  While a Houston PD, he spent half his career as a full-time investigator, culminating with
[2:27:14.440 --> 2:27:17.640]  an assignment as a sergeant in the financial crimes unit.
[2:27:17.640 --> 2:27:24.520]  He's a certified rescue diver, private pilot, and holds a certified fraud examiner certification.
[2:27:24.520 --> 2:27:29.120]  He was a founding member of Oathkeepers in 2009 and eventually was asked to be part of
[2:27:29.120 --> 2:27:31.120]  the Board of Directors a few years later.
[2:27:31.120 --> 2:27:35.640]  He resigned in November 2020 shortly after the election.
[2:27:35.640 --> 2:27:43.800]  YouTube, Ford slash Rumble, Facebook, The Blue Shark Show, TheBlueSharkShow.com is how you
[2:27:43.800 --> 2:27:44.800]  find him.
[2:27:44.800 --> 2:27:47.000]  TheBlueSharkShow.com and I appreciate him holding.
[2:27:47.000 --> 2:27:52.240]  We'll come back and talk to him about his concerns and really an honest retrospective
[2:27:52.240 --> 2:27:56.480]  on Stuart Rhodes because I didn't know what was being planned and again, I wish I could
[2:27:56.480 --> 2:28:00.080]  rely on the Justice Department but I've seen their lies so they're capable of anything.
[2:28:00.080 --> 2:28:06.440]  I don't know if any of this is true but we need to be really retrospective here and we
[2:28:06.440 --> 2:28:07.520]  know the feds were there.
[2:28:07.520 --> 2:28:08.840]  We know provocateurs were there.
[2:28:08.840 --> 2:28:15.000]  We know Antifa was there but there were a minority of people out of a million that did
[2:28:15.000 --> 2:28:19.400]  want to overthrow things and were pissed and at a certain point in 1776 you've got the
[2:28:19.400 --> 2:28:20.400]  old gentleman government.
[2:28:20.400 --> 2:28:25.360]  I see that but you don't take a government back with that type of activity and I'm totally
[2:28:25.360 --> 2:28:29.760]  against it and it's just terrible.
[2:28:29.760 --> 2:28:34.840]  And if what they say about Stuart Rhodes is even half true, I'm personally really pissed
[2:28:34.840 --> 2:28:39.240]  off because he could have got a lot of people killed, a lot more people killed and could
[2:28:39.240 --> 2:28:42.680]  have got me killed the whole country in a lot worse situation because if things have
[2:28:42.680 --> 2:28:46.040]  gone off the way Stuart wanted to in this indictment if it's true, he wanted a big
[2:28:46.040 --> 2:28:51.840]  bloody civil war to be triggered there, then there might be millions dead right now.

[2:31:57.040 --> 2:32:03.000]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare and with poisons
[2:32:03.000 --> 2:32:07.520]  and chemicals added to the food, it's all come out and they're doing that not because
[2:32:07.520 --> 2:32:13.080]  we're weak, but because we're made the image of God, the creator and we are powerful and
[2:32:13.080 --> 2:32:15.640]  the social engineers fear that so much.
[2:32:15.640 --> 2:32:20.160]  So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up
[2:32:20.160 --> 2:32:23.960]  with the boy, is it true?
[2:32:23.960 --> 2:32:29.800]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[2:32:29.800 --> 2:32:33.600]  They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural
[2:32:33.600 --> 2:32:40.240]  death because they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on the God
[2:32:40.240 --> 2:32:44.560]  of this world who is a loser and that's why it's so important that everybody keep info
[2:32:44.560 --> 2:32:48.760]  wars in the air now more than ever because even if you don't believe in God, what the
[2:32:48.760 --> 2:32:53.400]  globalists are manifesting and setting up is safe handling and we are opposing the one
[2:32:53.400 --> 2:32:59.480]  world government and the mark of the beast they just announced.
[2:32:59.480 --> 2:33:18.640]  Taking a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:18.640 --> 2:33:33.240]  You are listening to an infowars.com front line report if you are receiving this transmission,
[2:33:33.240 --> 2:33:34.240]  you are the resistance.
[2:33:34.240 --> 2:33:35.240]  You're a TV viewer.
[2:33:35.240 --> 2:33:37.400]  You're seeing footage out of North Texas, a suburb of Dallas, little Elm where Stuart
[2:33:37.400 --> 2:33:44.400]  Rose was staying at a friend's house and was raided by the FBI and the Justice Department,
[2:33:44.400 --> 2:33:48.800]  but no arrest of Rae Epps and they had the case ready against Rhodes, that's clear whether
[2:33:48.800 --> 2:33:55.320]  it's accurate or not, but we know that Rae Epps and Congress and all that coming out
[2:33:55.320 --> 2:33:59.160]  about the FBI is why they've gone after him now.
[2:33:59.160 --> 2:34:04.360]  That said, I wear my harness sleeve, everything I do in my own life, I just talk about it
[2:34:04.360 --> 2:34:07.960]  here on air, the good things I've done, the bad things I've done and I know I'm under
[2:34:07.960 --> 2:34:12.640]  FBI investigation for terrorism and sedition and everything else, total crap.
[2:34:12.640 --> 2:34:17.640]  The only thing I'm guilty of is being naive and walking into a trap on January 6th, but
[2:34:17.640 --> 2:34:22.600]  I wanted to get John D. Shirley and I know who he is, he has the BlueSharkShow.com, again
[2:34:22.600 --> 2:34:27.280]  a retired police officer from here in Texas and he's got a family member that's fighting
[2:34:27.280 --> 2:34:30.520]  for their life right now, so we appreciate him joining us from the hospital, I'm just
[2:34:30.520 --> 2:34:35.560]  putting that in there because this is important, that's why he's here and he resigned from
[2:34:35.560 --> 2:34:43.240]  Oathkeepers right before January 6th for the reasons he laid out an email that I'll show
[2:34:43.240 --> 2:34:48.960]  you right here, but he can give his own testimony because he's somebody that's been on Oathkeepers
[2:34:48.960 --> 2:34:53.440]  since the beginning and is a guy in good standing with the community and has a great record
[2:34:53.440 --> 2:34:57.880]  about what he thinks of this indictment and how much of it could be true because again,
[2:34:57.880 --> 2:35:02.800]  this is Stephen King level writing if it's fake and so that's why I wish the government
[2:35:02.800 --> 2:35:06.360]  was not this criminal, I wish they weren't criminal, I wish I could read an indictment
[2:35:06.360 --> 2:35:12.120]  and at least believe it may be part of its true, but if it is true, we're going to admit
[2:35:12.120 --> 2:35:16.760]  that it wasn't totally federally provocateur and that this was wrong because I don't want
[2:35:16.760 --> 2:35:22.080]  a civil war, folks, they're trying to start one, it's the last thing we want and I'll
[2:35:22.080 --> 2:35:26.880]  be damned as they say if I'm going to get set up as somebody wanting this because killing
[2:35:26.880 --> 2:35:30.600]  a bunch of military and police and them killing a bunch of us is not how we fix this country.
[2:35:30.600 --> 2:35:33.720]  We have to politically wake up, spiritually wake up, I'm going to stop ranting.
[2:35:33.720 --> 2:35:37.760]  John D. Shirley, thank you so much for spending time with us and just start wherever you'd
[2:35:37.760 --> 2:35:38.760]  like.
[2:35:38.760 --> 2:35:44.960]  We've got a lot of points here about his history and the Oathkeepers, Stuart in Texas 2019-2020,
[2:35:44.960 --> 2:35:49.120]  events leading up to the first D.C. rally and why you got out of there, events of the
[2:35:49.120 --> 2:35:55.640]  first D.C. rally, events of the night before, the Atlanta rally and just your resignation.
[2:35:55.640 --> 2:35:57.280]  So thanks for joining us, sir.
[2:35:57.280 --> 2:36:00.320]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[2:36:00.320 --> 2:36:05.080]  I reached out to your team because this is a story that needs to be told and I don't
[2:36:05.080 --> 2:36:06.160]  have the whole story.
[2:36:06.160 --> 2:36:14.520]  I wasn't there January 6th, I was at home and I was part of some events after the election
[2:36:14.520 --> 2:36:18.720]  before January 6th that led me to resign from the organization.
[2:36:18.720 --> 2:36:22.040]  In order for me to get to the start of that, I want to go back to the first D.C. rally
[2:36:22.040 --> 2:36:24.600]  after the election.
[2:36:24.600 --> 2:36:30.700]  I was asked to come to D.C. to help assist with some of the security planning or security
[2:36:30.700 --> 2:36:33.840]  of some important people that were going to be going through the rally.
[2:36:33.840 --> 2:36:34.840]  And I remember you there.
[2:36:34.840 --> 2:36:36.360]  I think I shook your hand, right?
[2:36:36.360 --> 2:36:37.360]  Yes, sir.
[2:36:37.360 --> 2:36:38.360]  Yes, you did.
[2:36:38.360 --> 2:36:43.840]  And if you remember, Alex, when we left the Freedom Plaza that day walking toward the
[2:36:43.840 --> 2:36:49.000]  Supreme Court block, Stuart Rose was nowhere to be found.
[2:36:49.000 --> 2:36:51.040]  Do you remember that?
[2:36:51.040 --> 2:36:55.560]  I remember that, I remember saying to Tim Enlon, I had security guard, I'm not a paranoid person,
[2:36:55.560 --> 2:36:59.040]  but I'm like, man, Stuart's acting creepy, why is he never around?
[2:36:59.040 --> 2:37:00.040]  Okay.
[2:37:00.040 --> 2:37:02.880]  So, we got through that rally and it went great.
[2:37:02.880 --> 2:37:07.200]  I mean, as far as we got you through the event and the other dignitaries, there was
[2:37:07.200 --> 2:37:08.200]  no problems.
[2:37:08.200 --> 2:37:11.240]  It was a great America celebrating event, okay?
[2:37:11.240 --> 2:37:13.800]  But I left there with some concern.
[2:37:13.800 --> 2:37:19.000]  And this was a giant rally that had 300, 400,000 people, a sea of people, us at the Supreme
[2:37:19.000 --> 2:37:21.000]  Court, totally peaceful.
[2:37:21.000 --> 2:37:24.080]  And absolutely, Alex, and I want to tell you, there were some DC police officers who were
[2:37:24.080 --> 2:37:29.200]  involved with your security details, some retired ones who were at the Million Man March
[2:37:29.200 --> 2:37:30.200]  back when it was done.
[2:37:30.200 --> 2:37:35.200]  And they told us, point blank, there's just as many people at that first DC rally as there
[2:37:35.200 --> 2:37:36.680]  was the Million Man March, okay?
[2:37:36.680 --> 2:37:38.800]  So it was a very large event.
[2:37:38.800 --> 2:37:44.440]  But following that event, I had some concerns that the organization that I was part of for
[2:37:44.440 --> 2:37:50.960]  almost 10 years at that point, something wasn't right, okay?
[2:37:50.960 --> 2:37:56.640]  So I left DC questioning if the organization really existed in anything more than really
[2:37:56.640 --> 2:38:00.920]  as an online presence in any real way at that point.
[2:38:00.920 --> 2:38:06.120]  I was asked to be part of the Atlanta rally like a week later.
[2:38:06.120 --> 2:38:12.400]  I arrived along with an associate of mine from prior in my career that I had trusted
[2:38:12.400 --> 2:38:15.600]  that he actually has more training and more experience than I did.
[2:38:15.600 --> 2:38:20.800]  And I brought him in because I wanted a fresh pair of eyes that wasn't deeply involved in
[2:38:20.800 --> 2:38:25.160]  the North Keepers, hadn't been involved and would be an independent voice, you know, to
[2:38:25.160 --> 2:38:29.480]  listen to it, to maybe confirm or help me explain the things that didn't make sense to me that
[2:38:29.480 --> 2:38:33.280]  went on in DC.
[2:38:33.280 --> 2:38:41.480]  The night before the Atlanta rally, I had a discussion with Stuart and he told me, you're
[2:38:41.480 --> 2:38:47.440]  the on ground guy in charge, which after seeing what happened in DC, to me meant nothing
[2:38:47.440 --> 2:38:50.840]  because there was no organization there, okay?
[2:38:50.840 --> 2:38:56.640]  So when he told me that, I said, that's fine, but I want the person that I trust to be my
[2:38:56.640 --> 2:39:00.920]  number two guy because he's going to be actually part of my security detail.
[2:39:00.920 --> 2:39:05.520]  And Stuart and I for the first time actually had a pretty open, open loud, not loud, open
[2:39:05.520 --> 2:39:12.200]  disagreement because he wanted his friend Wip, which is person number 10 in all the federal
[2:39:12.200 --> 2:39:13.200]  stuff.
[2:39:13.200 --> 2:39:18.040]  And he was named by Mother Jones in an article as Mike Simmons.
[2:39:18.040 --> 2:39:22.320]  I don't know his real name, but what I can tell you is he was not part of the Oath Keepers
[2:39:22.320 --> 2:39:28.560]  organization until sometime in early, late 2019 or early 2020.
[2:39:28.560 --> 2:39:37.000]  When I got to Atlanta, Stuart made it known that Wip was a VP of the organization.
[2:39:37.000 --> 2:39:41.120]  Now, I have an issue with this because as a bloomer or the board of directors, both
[2:39:41.120 --> 2:39:45.440]  Oath Keepers, I was never asked to vote to approve some new vice president, but I wasn't
[2:39:45.440 --> 2:39:51.760]  too surprised when I heard it because the organization's organizational structure had
[2:39:51.760 --> 2:39:55.200]  crumbled somewhat in the last few years of the organization's life.
[2:39:55.200 --> 2:39:56.200]  Sure.
[2:39:56.200 --> 2:39:59.120]  And we got 30 minutes to the next hour and now you've got a lot to talk about and I know
[2:39:59.120 --> 2:40:03.320]  you want to go off what you know, but just gut level stuff, because I knew Stuart, you
[2:40:03.320 --> 2:40:05.000]  know, 12 years ago, he seemed pretty normal.
[2:40:05.000 --> 2:40:09.360]  A few times he'd come around though, he seemed very apocalyptic, crazed.
[2:40:09.360 --> 2:40:11.800]  When I would see him, he never really came over and talked to us much.
[2:40:11.800 --> 2:40:16.720]  He was always at the edge of things and rallies around the country, like acting very strange.
[2:40:16.720 --> 2:40:20.640]  And I remember saying like, you think he's gone crazy or is he a fed or I mean, what
[2:40:20.640 --> 2:40:22.240]  do you think happened to him?
[2:40:22.240 --> 2:40:23.240]  Bad influences?
[2:40:23.240 --> 2:40:24.740]  What do you think is going on?
[2:40:24.740 --> 2:40:29.640]  My personal opinion is Stuart didn't seem to be a very strong and very, he's very good
[2:40:29.640 --> 2:40:30.640]  with rhetoric.
[2:40:30.640 --> 2:40:35.320]  He's a guy that he's got a pretty amazing mind, but sometimes he gets locked in his mind.
[2:40:35.320 --> 2:40:39.120]  So his organizational skills to run an organization were lacking.
[2:40:39.120 --> 2:40:43.520]  I'm afraid there were rogue elements that got involved in Oath Keepers.
[2:40:43.520 --> 2:40:48.680]  Sometime a year, year and a half before what happened on January 6th, it started pulling
[2:40:48.680 --> 2:40:50.400]  the organization in the wrong direction.
[2:40:50.400 --> 2:40:57.160]  And my story explains why I resigned and I think gives a nod to that things were going
[2:40:57.160 --> 2:40:58.160]  really wrong.
[2:40:58.160 --> 2:41:01.800]  Let me ask you this, let me ask your opinion, because you're a long term veteran police
[2:41:01.800 --> 2:41:06.000]  officer and Oath Keepers from the very start.
[2:41:06.000 --> 2:41:10.880]  Why do you, because I read this indictment and I mean, it's true, it's horrible.
[2:41:10.880 --> 2:41:12.120]  The problem is they lie so much.
[2:41:12.120 --> 2:41:13.120]  I don't know if any of it's true.
[2:41:13.120 --> 2:41:18.240]  And then you took a Carlson had a guest on who's been re indicted and enlisted in this
[2:41:18.240 --> 2:41:19.800]  and they didn't have a boat.
[2:41:19.800 --> 2:41:21.000]  They weren't planning an attack.
[2:41:21.000 --> 2:41:23.000]  That guy wasn't even in the capital.
[2:41:23.000 --> 2:41:25.040]  So and I believe him because I've seen the lies.
[2:41:25.040 --> 2:41:28.560]  So what do you think is really going on here?
[2:41:28.560 --> 2:41:36.760]  Well, my gut tells me that the left, the cabal, needed a change in narrative.
[2:41:36.760 --> 2:41:41.600]  And I think they planned on indicting Stuart and I guess the other guys at some point,
[2:41:41.600 --> 2:41:45.400]  but I actually believe that they were, they're trying to do a narrative shift because post
[2:41:45.400 --> 2:41:49.680]  January 6th, their narrative is collapsing when it comes to January 6th.
[2:41:49.680 --> 2:41:55.360]  Then you have the Supreme Court knocking down the majority of the OSHA mandate for the vaccine.
[2:41:55.360 --> 2:41:57.960]  They needed desperately a change in narrative.
[2:41:57.960 --> 2:42:03.320]  And so I think they threw out this, what I think is a pretty embarrassing looking indictment.
[2:42:03.320 --> 2:42:09.560]  I've, I've, I've written, you know, statements in supportive indictments during my career
[2:42:09.560 --> 2:42:14.200]  and they always have detail, specific detail.
[2:42:14.200 --> 2:42:19.240]  This document lacks any specific detail to show any kind of underlying crime.
[2:42:19.240 --> 2:42:21.120]  So I think it's extremely weak.
[2:42:21.120 --> 2:42:23.400]  It's absolutely a political prosecution.
[2:42:23.400 --> 2:42:26.880]  Whether Stuart Rhodes is compromised to some level, I don't know.
[2:42:26.880 --> 2:42:31.920]  But I believe that the events of the first DC rally and the events of the Atlanta rally,
[2:42:31.920 --> 2:42:35.720]  when I, when I can get to the details, we'll show you that there's reason, there was reason
[2:42:35.720 --> 2:42:36.720]  to be concerned.
[2:42:36.720 --> 2:42:40.720]  And when I resigned the way I did, and I did it publicly, I posted it on my social media
[2:42:40.720 --> 2:42:42.440]  that I was breaking with the organization.
[2:42:42.440 --> 2:42:45.600]  I did it because I saw, I saw things that didn't make sense and I wasn't going to be
[2:42:45.600 --> 2:42:46.600]  involved.
[2:42:46.600 --> 2:42:48.920]  No, I mean, I remember as I've seen you and heard you for years, I remember when you
[2:42:48.920 --> 2:42:50.440]  did it, it was a big deal.
[2:42:50.440 --> 2:42:51.440]  We'll be right back.

[2:47:28.880 --> 2:47:41.440]  Boys, the devil coming after us folks, that's okay, you know who wins the end.
[2:47:41.440 --> 2:47:47.400]  John D. Shirley is a retired police officer, been in Oath Keepers more than 10 years and
[2:47:47.400 --> 2:47:50.960]  he resigned right before January 6th and put a public letter out.
[2:47:50.960 --> 2:47:55.560]  I remember Stuart complaining about it because I just happened to see the gossip out there
[2:47:55.560 --> 2:47:59.400]  and I remember Shirley was a good guy and had done a great job and it was about, let's
[2:47:59.400 --> 2:48:03.640]  follow our oath and let's de-escalate and let's work with the police and let's have
[2:48:03.640 --> 2:48:07.440]  civil defense and let's come together, that's a good mission.
[2:48:07.440 --> 2:48:11.640]  I didn't believe Stuart was a Fed but did he get infiltrated?
[2:48:11.640 --> 2:48:15.400]  Did he get, he definitely changed, he got more aggressive when he was here a few times
[2:48:15.400 --> 2:48:20.560]  as a guest even before January 6th and after and like what are you going to do when the
[2:48:20.560 --> 2:48:21.560]  war starts?
[2:48:21.560 --> 2:48:27.560]  You're just going to sit around and talk and I'm like, who am I going to text to?
[2:48:27.560 --> 2:48:32.560]  I remember like, here in the studio, during breaks like, yes Stuart, I'm on a military,
[2:48:32.560 --> 2:48:33.560]  what am I going to do?
[2:48:33.560 --> 2:48:37.360]  This is a political thing, this is a cultural thing, this is a spiritual thing and then I,
[2:48:37.360 --> 2:48:43.040]  he's like, oh I guess you're right and then boom, this goes along, you got the feds, you
[2:48:43.040 --> 2:48:47.480]  got REAPs, you got the antifa, you got them all provocaturing there and then you've got
[2:48:47.480 --> 2:48:51.200]  Stuart believing there was about to be an overthrow of the government, believing there
[2:48:51.200 --> 2:48:52.520]  was about to be this big defeat.
[2:48:52.520 --> 2:48:57.080]  I guess if you believe this indictment, was he being lied to by Q people?
[2:48:57.080 --> 2:49:00.120]  Was he delusional or is this whole federal indictment a lie?
[2:49:00.120 --> 2:49:03.960]  Let's go back to John D. Shirley right now who was one of the founders and board members
[2:49:03.960 --> 2:49:08.560]  of O Keepers who resigned shortly before this all happened last year to give us his continued
[2:49:08.560 --> 2:49:09.560]  take.
[2:49:09.560 --> 2:49:10.560]  Please continue.
[2:49:10.560 --> 2:49:11.560]  Thanks Alex.
[2:49:11.560 --> 2:49:16.520]  Before I go back to what I was telling you about before and the story I have, very important
[2:49:16.520 --> 2:49:22.640]  distinctions, you know, I've known Stuart for 10 years and in our communication, you
[2:49:22.640 --> 2:49:30.080]  know, before the DC rally never increased and I want to tell you, he is no fan of Donald
[2:49:30.080 --> 2:49:34.080]  Trump very, very plainly once you'd understand and I don't know if y'all had those kind of
[2:49:34.080 --> 2:49:38.200]  discussions in between yourselves, but I'm telling you, Stuart was not a fan of Donald
[2:49:38.200 --> 2:49:39.200]  Trump.
[2:49:39.200 --> 2:49:43.960]  No, other people have told me that he didn't basically know he hid that from me.
[2:49:43.960 --> 2:49:50.320]  Okay, well, I'm telling you, I had several pretty long discussions with him about Donald
[2:49:50.320 --> 2:49:51.320]  Trump.
[2:49:51.320 --> 2:49:52.320]  I just know this.
[2:49:52.320 --> 2:49:53.320]  When I first knew him 12 years ago, he didn't act creepy.
[2:49:53.320 --> 2:49:56.320]  The last few times he was around, I said, man, that guy's creepy.
[2:49:56.320 --> 2:50:00.720]  He would just kind of look at me like, I don't know how to describe it, like I was a glass
[2:50:00.720 --> 2:50:05.680]  of ice water in the Sahara Desert, he was just kind of, I saw a crazed thing with him.
[2:50:05.680 --> 2:50:07.560]  Is that what you're getting at?
[2:50:07.560 --> 2:50:09.280]  Well, you know, I didn't see that.
[2:50:09.280 --> 2:50:10.280]  I didn't see that part.
[2:50:10.280 --> 2:50:15.600]  I'm just saying that, you know, the organization changed near the end and I'm going to tell
[2:50:15.600 --> 2:50:16.600]  you why.
[2:50:16.600 --> 2:50:20.360]  I'm going to go back to my store now if that's okay.
[2:50:20.360 --> 2:50:24.360]  The night before the Atlanta rally, I had a heated discussion with Stuart.
[2:50:24.360 --> 2:50:26.960]  It got pretty heated about leadership and control of what was going to go on the next
[2:50:26.960 --> 2:50:27.960]  day.
[2:50:27.960 --> 2:50:32.320]  The next day when the rally actually occurred, there was no leadership because I wouldn't
[2:50:32.320 --> 2:50:34.320]  acquiesce to him and he wouldn't acquiesce to me.
[2:50:34.320 --> 2:50:38.400]  So my team was just in plain clothes, just watching the crowd, making sure that Antifa
[2:50:38.400 --> 2:50:42.680]  stayed in their place and the Patriots stayed in their place, just monitoring what was going
[2:50:42.680 --> 2:50:43.920]  on.
[2:50:43.920 --> 2:50:47.840]  The police in Atlanta did a fantastic job of keeping the crowds apart.
[2:50:47.840 --> 2:50:51.560]  They haven't separated with physical barriers and had plenty of staff out there.
[2:50:51.560 --> 2:50:54.840]  When the rally was over, because nothing happened during the rally, when the rally was over,
[2:50:54.840 --> 2:50:58.360]  they sent Antifa one way and they sent the Patriots another way.
[2:50:58.360 --> 2:51:02.440]  Well, me and my team having experience and training, we pretty much knew where a flash
[2:51:02.440 --> 2:51:05.800]  point was going to be if there was going to be a flash point where the two groups would
[2:51:05.800 --> 2:51:06.800]  come together.
[2:51:06.800 --> 2:51:11.200]  So we walked two or three blocks to where that was, just the three of us, and within
[2:51:11.200 --> 2:51:15.800]  a short amount of time, Antifa appeared around a corner about a block away walking toward
[2:51:15.800 --> 2:51:16.800]  us.
[2:51:16.800 --> 2:51:18.880]  Now, very important to understand.
[2:51:18.880 --> 2:51:22.680]  I can't speak for Antifa all over the country, but I can speak for the people that were
[2:51:22.680 --> 2:51:27.280]  in, who were claiming to be part of Antifa in Atlanta, is it was a complete lark.
[2:51:27.280 --> 2:51:32.160]  And when I say it's a complete lark, the average age of the Antifa member that showed up into
[2:51:32.160 --> 2:51:35.240]  the Atlanta rally was probably about 17.
[2:51:35.240 --> 2:51:38.360]  There were some that looked to be as young as 14.
[2:51:38.360 --> 2:51:41.920]  They had a couple of older handlers that were probably in their 40s or 50s that weren't
[2:51:41.920 --> 2:51:46.760]  even dressed like them, but were obviously controlling the Antifa movements.
[2:51:46.760 --> 2:51:53.080]  There were two people with rifles in the Antifa crowd and several had pocket knives or knives
[2:51:53.080 --> 2:51:55.120]  visible on their quote unquote uniforms.
[2:51:55.120 --> 2:52:01.000]  Now, their uniforms were basically black with paintball gear as their protection.
[2:52:01.000 --> 2:52:05.360]  So they looked scary and their shields that they carried were actually made of plastic
[2:52:05.360 --> 2:52:12.040]  drums that they cut up and painted black.
[2:52:12.040 --> 2:52:15.760]  So it was a lark, but they had guns.
[2:52:15.760 --> 2:52:21.280]  So they passed us and started giving trouble to one of the Trump supporters, and we stopped
[2:52:21.280 --> 2:52:22.280]  it from happening.
[2:52:22.280 --> 2:52:23.280]  We didn't even talk to them.
[2:52:23.280 --> 2:52:24.720]  We just guided the man away.
[2:52:24.720 --> 2:52:29.320]  And I guess they saw that we looked like serious people and they left us alone.
[2:52:29.320 --> 2:52:34.400]  For two hours, we followed the Antifa around downtown Atlanta, harassing people, sometimes
[2:52:34.400 --> 2:52:39.360]  yelling at us that my team would stay a block to a block and a half behind them, not talking
[2:52:39.360 --> 2:52:41.760]  to them, not engaging them at all.
[2:52:41.760 --> 2:52:45.560]  We're just watching what's going on in case they cause trouble.
[2:52:45.560 --> 2:52:52.280]  After about two hours, they congregated in an area that was near where we started.
[2:52:52.280 --> 2:52:57.160]  When we got there, they were on one side of the street about 150 feet away.
[2:52:57.160 --> 2:53:01.040]  We were across the street on the other side, a drunk man.
[2:53:01.040 --> 2:53:04.560]  And the reason I know he was drunk, and my team knew he was drunk, is we saw him that
[2:53:04.560 --> 2:53:09.400]  morning at about 8.30 before the rally, drinking in the parking lot where everyone was parking
[2:53:09.400 --> 2:53:10.400]  for the rally.
[2:53:10.400 --> 2:53:13.320]  And you could smell it on him when you walked past him.
[2:53:13.320 --> 2:53:19.200]  This same man that I saw earlier that day appeared basically out of nowhere and was approaching
[2:53:19.200 --> 2:53:25.520]  Antifa with his shirt off, screaming and yelling at them, infinities trying to incite them.
[2:53:25.520 --> 2:53:30.600]  Two of the two of the Antifa guys, the two with the rifles, walked toward him.
[2:53:30.600 --> 2:53:35.560]  And at some point in this, in the first encounter, one of them racked a shotgun.
[2:53:35.560 --> 2:53:39.000]  One of them had a shotgun and racked the shotgun, the Antifa guy.
[2:53:39.000 --> 2:53:44.000]  So we had what looked to appear to be a violent situation about to start.
[2:53:44.000 --> 2:53:48.720]  Now, fortunately, the drunk guy, I guess, decided it was probably a bad idea at that
[2:53:48.720 --> 2:53:53.600]  point, turned around and went back the other direction, disappeared around the corner.
[2:53:53.600 --> 2:53:55.840]  Five minutes later, he reappeared.
[2:53:55.840 --> 2:54:00.640]  He re-engaged Antifa, screaming and yelling, cursing them, obscenities, trying to engage
[2:54:00.640 --> 2:54:03.320]  them, trying to make them become violent.
[2:54:03.320 --> 2:54:06.560]  My team and I were just sitting there across the street watching what was going on.
[2:54:06.560 --> 2:54:09.120]  Again, he retreated around the corner.
[2:54:09.120 --> 2:54:15.000]  A few minutes later, he appeared again, except this time he walked across the street and
[2:54:15.000 --> 2:54:23.200]  walked behind my team within five feet of us, screaming over our backs toward Antifa,
[2:54:23.200 --> 2:54:25.320]  antagonizing Antifa.
[2:54:25.320 --> 2:54:30.560]  Now, I don't remember for sure if we said anything to him, but shortly after that...
[2:54:30.560 --> 2:54:33.360]  The point is, there's a lot of dirty tricks going on.
[2:54:33.360 --> 2:54:34.360]  Keep going.
[2:54:34.360 --> 2:54:35.360]  Okay.
[2:54:35.360 --> 2:54:36.360]  Yes.
[2:54:36.360 --> 2:54:37.360]  Okay.
[2:54:37.360 --> 2:54:39.680]  So he was behind us trying to incite them, and then he left.
[2:54:39.680 --> 2:54:43.160]  And people broke up and we, at that point, were pretty tired.
[2:54:43.160 --> 2:54:46.920]  We went back to the, to the quote unquote command post, which was really just a panel
[2:54:46.920 --> 2:54:49.680]  van where they were handing out water and snacks.
[2:54:49.680 --> 2:54:56.360]  And it hit, it hit myself and my team at about the same time, when this guy was disappearing
[2:54:56.360 --> 2:55:01.760]  around the corner, each time he was going right where the parking lot was, where the
[2:55:01.760 --> 2:55:08.640]  command post, where the oath keepers were set up every time.
[2:55:08.640 --> 2:55:09.640]  Now...
[2:55:09.640 --> 2:55:13.320]  What you're saying is, give us your real, we're not going to try and attack Stuart here,
[2:55:13.320 --> 2:55:17.480]  but we want to know, is he like a super deep state Tim McVeigh guy that got set up by the
[2:55:17.480 --> 2:55:23.840]  deep state, or is he his own crazy operative, or is he being set up, and is he totally innocent?
[2:55:23.840 --> 2:55:25.960]  What do you really think about Stuart?
[2:55:25.960 --> 2:55:30.200]  As we now know, he went back with REIAPS to the founding of this, so that REIAPS was involved
[2:55:30.200 --> 2:55:31.200]  at the very beginning.
[2:55:31.200 --> 2:55:35.320]  And REIAPS is obviously being protected, obviously working for probably the Southern
[2:55:35.320 --> 2:55:37.120]  Property Law Center, fits the MO.
[2:55:37.120 --> 2:55:39.360]  I mean, what do you think is going on?
[2:55:39.360 --> 2:55:42.400]  Well, important distinction, Alex.
[2:55:42.400 --> 2:55:47.760]  I don't remember ever hearing the name REIAPS before the news of January 6th.
[2:55:47.760 --> 2:55:51.640]  No, I understand, because he only goes back to the founding of oath keepers, so I know
[2:55:51.640 --> 2:55:54.720]  you were there as well, but he was there at the very start.
[2:55:54.720 --> 2:55:55.720]  And I never heard of it.
[2:55:55.720 --> 2:56:00.040]  So, what I think happened, I actually believe that rogue elements got involved with oath
[2:56:00.040 --> 2:56:06.000]  keepers sometime before January 6th, six months a year, you know, I suspect that person...
[2:56:06.000 --> 2:56:10.880]  And maybe he was weak-minded, they gave him money, they beefed up his ego, he didn't know,
[2:56:10.880 --> 2:56:11.880]  yeah.
[2:56:11.880 --> 2:56:18.000]  So, person number 10, who was identified by Mother Jones as Mike Simmons, I'm very suspicious
[2:56:18.000 --> 2:56:19.000]  of.
[2:56:19.000 --> 2:56:24.640]  He appeared late in the evolution of oath keepers, and shortly after that is when I started
[2:56:24.640 --> 2:56:28.720]  noticing things that bugged me, and shortly after that is when I resigned, because of...
[2:56:28.720 --> 2:56:32.560]  I believe that my team was being set up at the Atlanta Rally.
[2:56:32.560 --> 2:56:38.800]  I think somebody who was at that command post that day wanted a violent confrontation involving
[2:56:38.800 --> 2:56:43.640]  a elected and outspoken political conservative.
[2:56:43.640 --> 2:56:44.640]  I totally agree with you.
[2:56:44.640 --> 2:56:49.240]  I started seeing Stuart really change, what about two years ago?
[2:56:49.240 --> 2:56:54.360]  It was a year or two years, and once again, I'm not throwing stones at Stuart.
[2:56:54.360 --> 2:57:00.320]  There was probably 15 guys around that command post when we...
[2:57:00.320 --> 2:57:08.680]  But when you read this indictment, they have no credibility, but I mean, I gotta hand it
[2:57:08.680 --> 2:57:09.760]  to whoever...
[2:57:09.760 --> 2:57:14.760]  If this is made up, this is some really sophisticated BS.
[2:57:14.760 --> 2:57:23.520]  Alex, they've wanted to indict Stuart actively since the Bundy Ranch incident, which I did
[2:57:23.520 --> 2:57:25.920]  not attend, by the way.
[2:57:25.920 --> 2:57:29.000]  Prior to the 1st December Rally, my contributions to oath keepers was mainly...
[2:57:29.000 --> 2:57:32.640]  I was very involved in the very beginning, getting it off the ground, and I served on
[2:57:32.640 --> 2:57:33.640]  the board of directors.
[2:57:33.640 --> 2:57:35.360]  John, that's where I wanted to go next.
[2:57:35.360 --> 2:57:38.640]  Tell us about oath keepers and its history for all these new people that don't know what
[2:57:38.640 --> 2:57:42.120]  it really is, because I noticed a bunch of retired and current police and military good
[2:57:42.120 --> 2:57:46.960]  people want to just promote constitution.
[2:57:46.960 --> 2:57:49.160]  Christmas 2021 is gone.
[2:57:49.160 --> 2:57:54.440]  It's in the rearview mirror, but you can still take advantage of Christmas prices going to
[2:57:54.440 --> 2:57:56.640]  the new year at infowarstore.com.

[2:59:44.520 --> 2:59:48.320]  same time at infowarstore.com.
[2:59:48.320 --> 3:00:07.520]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:00:07.520 --> 3:00:19.760]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, now look, there's a big debate on should we have a revolution
[3:00:19.760 --> 3:00:25.120]  or not, and I'll just be honest with you, I'm not scared of prison or dying because
[3:00:25.120 --> 3:00:29.000]  I've committed this fight, but I am scared of leading people in a destruction.
[3:00:29.000 --> 3:00:33.040]  And I've learned enough in my life that you know how stuff's going to go down, don't have
[3:00:33.040 --> 3:00:34.040]  been around the block.
[3:00:34.040 --> 3:00:39.600]  I'll talk about that some at the start of the next seven stages, join us, but I'm not
[3:00:39.600 --> 3:00:44.120]  scared to fight the new world order, I'm scared to fight them the way they want me to, and
[3:00:44.120 --> 3:00:47.280]  then we lose everything, because they want a physical fight.
[3:00:47.280 --> 3:00:51.360]  There's no doubt about that, because we're intellectually beating them.
[3:00:51.360 --> 3:00:55.760]  Now it doesn't mean I'm going to take people physically attacking me and not fight back,
[3:00:55.760 --> 3:01:00.000]  but I'm just saying, why do we want to give our enemies what they want?
[3:01:00.000 --> 3:01:05.720]  And clearly, Stuart was going in that direction.
[3:01:05.720 --> 3:01:06.720]  Are these indictments real?
[3:01:06.720 --> 3:01:07.720]  We don't know.
[3:01:07.720 --> 3:01:12.320]  John D. Shirley was a founding member of Oath Keepers, and he's now a retired police officer
[3:01:12.320 --> 3:01:17.720]  from Houston, and he's got the Blue Shark Show.com that you should check out, but this is a shorter
[3:01:17.720 --> 3:01:22.320]  segment, longer segment coming up, but just continue on with why you got into Oath Keepers
[3:01:22.320 --> 3:01:26.480]  and what Oath Keepers did then versus now.
[3:01:26.480 --> 3:01:28.360]  All right, sounds good.
[3:01:28.360 --> 3:01:33.320]  Alex, before I go there, I want to say that after the event that happened in Atlanta,
[3:01:33.320 --> 3:01:39.880]  and I honestly believe that my team was attempted to be set up, and thankfully, thankfully nothing
[3:01:39.880 --> 3:01:44.320]  happened, because I didn't want violence then, I don't want violence now, but the important
[3:01:44.320 --> 3:01:48.880]  thing is, within 24 hours, I resigned from the organization, because I was at that point
[3:01:48.880 --> 3:01:53.920]  convinced that something was seriously wrong, that the organization was going rogue or somebody
[3:01:53.920 --> 3:01:54.920]  who was...
[3:01:54.920 --> 3:02:00.680]  Let's be clear, they were sending in a provocateur from the Oath Keeper encampment to mess with
[3:02:00.680 --> 3:02:06.840]  an Oath Keeper detachment that was doing intel gathering.
[3:02:06.840 --> 3:02:12.320]  Clearly they were trying to play you in some type of thing they were ginning up, and you
[3:02:12.320 --> 3:02:15.520]  didn't know who did it from Oath Keepers, you're just not an idiot, you could see the
[3:02:15.520 --> 3:02:16.520]  setup.
[3:02:16.520 --> 3:02:19.040]  That's right, absolutely right.
[3:02:19.040 --> 3:02:26.320]  Can you imagine the headline, Alex, had a cop and two other guys, a cop and an elected
[3:02:26.320 --> 3:02:34.000]  official, and two other experienced, trained, former government employees, get into a firefight
[3:02:34.000 --> 3:02:37.160]  with a bunch of 14 to 16-year-olds?
[3:02:37.160 --> 3:02:38.160]  What would that look like, Alex?
[3:02:38.160 --> 3:02:41.560]  You'd have killed them all, and then you'd have been mass murderers on the nose.
[3:02:41.560 --> 3:02:46.400]  Okay, so that's what happened in Atlanta, and that's why I resigned the next day, and
[3:02:46.400 --> 3:02:51.760]  I can't point the finger directly at Stuart Rhodes, I can point the finger that the organization
[3:02:51.760 --> 3:02:57.520]  under his leadership at the very end got really scary, scary to me enough to work.
[3:02:57.520 --> 3:03:04.760]  I threw away 10 years of association with the organization in 24 hours after that experience.
[3:03:04.760 --> 3:03:09.280]  So a lot went on at the very end, but let's go back to the beginning.
[3:03:09.280 --> 3:03:14.080]  Oath Keepers established sometime in 2009, and I can't even tell you when, but a guy
[3:03:14.080 --> 3:03:19.040]  actually got a start on the Free Republic forums, and a bunch of former police officers
[3:03:19.040 --> 3:03:23.840]  and soldiers said, you know what, we're really concerned about the soldiers and the police
[3:03:23.840 --> 3:03:26.200]  officers not paying attention to their oaths of office.
[3:03:26.200 --> 3:03:29.400]  There are very specific things that they swear an oath to, and it sure seems like they're
[3:03:29.400 --> 3:03:34.040]  forgetting that, and they're doing the bidding of evil politicians, and so it was born sometime
[3:03:34.040 --> 3:03:38.400]  after 2009, and that's when I got involved with the organization, and I actually started
[3:03:38.400 --> 3:03:41.800]  the first Oath Keepers Facebook group way back before I even got permission.
[3:03:41.800 --> 3:03:46.880]  I had to ask forgiveness after I created it because I was not affiliated with the organization.
[3:03:46.880 --> 3:03:50.840]  So I've been involved from the beginning, and from the very beginning, the organization
[3:03:50.840 --> 3:03:55.240]  was meant to be almost 100% a teaching organization.
[3:03:55.240 --> 3:04:00.680]  Our whole goal was just to remind police officers, remind soldiers why it is you swear your oath
[3:04:00.680 --> 3:04:04.680]  of office, and who you swear that oath of office to, so the Constitution is to the people.
[3:04:04.680 --> 3:04:09.200]  It's not to rulers, it's not to political parties, it's not to their bosses and the
[3:04:09.200 --> 3:04:13.000]  police department, it's not to their generals, they're swearing an oath to the Constitution
[3:04:13.000 --> 3:04:15.600]  to protect and defend the people, basically.
[3:04:15.600 --> 3:04:19.400]  They're the people's protectors, and that's what Oath Keepers was designed to do.
[3:04:19.400 --> 3:04:24.440]  So if you take a look and see what it was envisioned as and what it was established as, versus
[3:04:24.440 --> 3:04:30.640]  what the picture that is being painted on January 6th, I don't recognize what happened
[3:04:30.640 --> 3:04:32.640]  on January 6th as being Oath Keepers.
[3:04:32.640 --> 3:04:35.920]  All right, stay right there, John D. Sherwood, come back and talk more about this, but it's
[3:04:35.920 --> 3:04:40.680]  the perfect sigh-off that was run by the Southern Prairie Law Center, some group like it, hypothetically
[3:04:40.680 --> 3:04:41.680]  from the beginning.
[3:04:41.680 --> 3:04:46.920]  To have a big legitimate, open, come together, have peace, have justice, rediscover America's
[3:04:46.920 --> 3:04:52.240]  civil defense, and then turn it into an instrument to trigger a new civil war so you can demonize
[3:04:52.240 --> 3:04:53.240]  your opposition.
[3:04:53.240 --> 3:04:58.360]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[3:04:58.360 --> 3:05:00.280]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[3:05:00.280 --> 3:05:01.280]  Welcome.
[3:05:01.280 --> 3:05:02.280]  Hello, Alex.
[3:05:02.280 --> 3:05:03.280]  Yes, Malcolm.
[3:05:03.280 --> 3:05:06.280]  Welcome back in real short, where the other patrons can get on the line.
[3:05:06.280 --> 3:05:11.280]  Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schreuer, SuperMail
[3:05:11.280 --> 3:05:14.000]  Vitality and Brain Force Plus.
[3:05:14.000 --> 3:05:17.000]  Mix those two together, you're an unstoppable tank.
[3:05:17.000 --> 3:05:18.600]  SuperMail Vitality really, really works.
[3:05:18.600 --> 3:05:24.760]  It's cold-pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up, and so it has
[3:05:24.760 --> 3:05:29.720]  a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well, but just aren't
[3:05:29.720 --> 3:05:30.720]  as strong.
[3:05:30.720 --> 3:05:32.160]  This is like a very fine wine.
[3:05:32.160 --> 3:05:34.520]  In fact, each batch is different.
[3:05:34.520 --> 3:05:36.480]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[3:05:36.480 --> 3:05:40.040]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong?
[3:05:40.040 --> 3:05:41.040]  That's just how it is.
[3:05:41.040 --> 3:05:42.560]  It's how it works.
[3:05:42.560 --> 3:05:44.200]  So it's always good.
[3:05:44.200 --> 3:05:46.320]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[3:05:46.320 --> 3:06:12.720]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls-Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[3:06:12.720 --> 3:06:18.400]  All right, John D. Shirley is a retired police officer and he was one of the founding members
[3:06:18.400 --> 3:06:19.600]  of Oathkeepers.
[3:06:19.600 --> 3:06:25.160]  He resigned shortly before January 6th because he thought what he saw was some of the Oathkeeper
[3:06:25.160 --> 3:06:30.840]  operatives trying to set up a fight between them and Antifa and thought, this is really
[3:06:30.840 --> 3:06:31.840]  creepy.
[3:06:31.840 --> 3:06:32.840]  This is crazy.
[3:06:32.840 --> 3:06:37.440]  So for some stations that just joined us, recap what you think's happened and where
[3:06:37.440 --> 3:06:41.160]  this is going because obviously we know that there was this ray of sky.
[3:06:41.160 --> 3:06:42.600]  We know the feds were involved.
[3:06:42.600 --> 3:06:44.960]  We know Antio was dressed up like Trump supporters.
[3:06:44.960 --> 3:06:48.560]  We know they ordered the stand down of the Capitol Police.
[3:06:48.560 --> 3:06:52.680]  We get there branding Americans as terrorists doing this big power grab rollout.
[3:06:52.680 --> 3:06:56.680]  But at the same time, we need to also warn people that if you think you're joining a
[3:06:56.680 --> 3:07:02.360]  militia or something, you need to know a lot of the time it's going to be federal and
[3:07:02.360 --> 3:07:08.360]  globalist organizations doing that to control the opposition, to be able to then stage events
[3:07:08.360 --> 3:07:09.920]  and blame you for them.
[3:07:09.920 --> 3:07:13.560]  When anybody in a militia or any group that goes, oh, don't listen to Jones, he's just
[3:07:13.560 --> 3:07:17.480]  anti-militia or he's anti-Oathkeeper, no, I'm not.
[3:07:17.480 --> 3:07:21.920]  I'm all about citizens being armed and having civil defense and protecting ourselves and
[3:07:21.920 --> 3:07:23.680]  having communities of the people.
[3:07:23.680 --> 3:07:29.640]  I'm saying that scares the system and that's their in run around the Second Amendment is
[3:07:29.640 --> 3:07:37.160]  to create or infiltrate paramilitary organizations to then set them up for crimes the deep state
[3:07:37.160 --> 3:07:38.160]  commits.
[3:07:38.160 --> 3:07:44.040]  The whole push, the reelection campaign of Joe Biden is that Americans are about to
[3:07:44.040 --> 3:07:50.480]  stage terror attacks and that Americans are evil and that white people are bad and police
[3:07:50.480 --> 3:07:54.560]  are bad and everything and we've got to have martial law to stop them.
[3:07:54.560 --> 3:07:59.280]  So this is their big push and it looks like Stewart fell right in their trap.
[3:07:59.280 --> 3:08:00.280]  We pray for him.
[3:08:00.280 --> 3:08:04.380]  He's in jail right now and we don't know what the Justice Department is saying is true.
[3:08:04.380 --> 3:08:06.040]  So right now we're in a nebulous area.
[3:08:06.040 --> 3:08:10.360]  But we're talking to one of the founders who was there and saw a very dangerous direction.
[3:08:10.360 --> 3:08:11.760]  So please continue, Mr. Shirley.
[3:08:11.760 --> 3:08:15.440]  All right, quick, quick recap for those who didn't catch it before the break.
[3:08:15.440 --> 3:08:20.040]  I had serious concerns after the first D.C. rally shortly after the election.
[3:08:20.040 --> 3:08:24.840]  I had concerns about the Oath Coopers organization and stuff that was going on internally.
[3:08:24.840 --> 3:08:29.840]  In the Atlanta rally about a week and a half later, I had other serious concerns culminating
[3:08:29.840 --> 3:08:36.880]  with what I believe was an attempted, created violent confrontation between Antifa and my
[3:08:36.880 --> 3:08:38.720]  security team.
[3:08:38.720 --> 3:08:39.960]  I resigned the next day.
[3:08:39.960 --> 3:08:42.840]  So that brings us back to where I talked at the top of the founding.
[3:08:42.840 --> 3:08:46.720]  The Oath Keepers was founded as one thing, a teaching organization and on January 6th,
[3:08:46.720 --> 3:08:51.760]  I don't recognize the organization that they're calling Oath Keepers what went on on January
[3:08:51.760 --> 3:08:52.760]  6th.
[3:08:52.760 --> 3:08:59.640]  I believe that there were people that infiltrated and either tricked Stewart, got leverage on
[3:08:59.640 --> 3:09:04.600]  Stewart or something, and the person that has the most smoke, and I'm not accusing him
[3:09:04.600 --> 3:09:10.160]  of anything, is the person that's identified as Person 10 in all the investigation who was
[3:09:10.160 --> 3:09:11.160]  known as WIP.
[3:09:11.160 --> 3:09:16.160]  And the reason I'm suspicious of WIP is he was not a member of Oath Keepers to my knowledge
[3:09:16.160 --> 3:09:18.980]  before late 2019 or 2020.
[3:09:18.980 --> 3:09:24.440]  And then when I showed up in D.C. for the first D.C. rally, Stewart was referring to
[3:09:24.440 --> 3:09:27.600]  him as a VP of the organization, and I never voted for him.
[3:09:27.600 --> 3:09:30.600]  I was on the board of directors, and I never heard he was made of VP.
[3:09:30.600 --> 3:09:36.120]  So you have a guy from Nowhere who goes by WIP, nobody even knew his real name.
[3:09:36.120 --> 3:09:38.400]  He wouldn't tell anybody his full name.
[3:09:38.400 --> 3:09:45.520]  And if you remember, when he finally showed up at the first D.C. rally to the area where
[3:09:45.520 --> 3:09:49.800]  we were trying to help the dignitaries get through the first D.C. rally, he showed up
[3:09:49.800 --> 3:09:56.720]  and he was dressed in dark clothing with a dark backpack and a face mask covering the
[3:09:56.720 --> 3:10:01.960]  entire lower half of his face with a cap pulled down over his entire forehead.
[3:10:01.960 --> 3:10:07.600]  That's how he was dressed when he was supposedly representing Oath Keepers at the first D.C.
[3:10:07.600 --> 3:10:09.760]  rally right after the election.
[3:10:09.760 --> 3:10:12.000]  So I think there's smoke all around him.
[3:10:12.000 --> 3:10:13.000]  I don't know who he is.
[3:10:13.000 --> 3:10:17.080]  I don't even know what his real name is, but I know that Stewart was calling him a VP,
[3:10:17.080 --> 3:10:20.120]  and I know that he was at the D.C. first rally.
[3:10:20.120 --> 3:10:24.680]  He was at Atlanta when my team got set up, and he was also at January 6th, and he has
[3:10:24.680 --> 3:10:28.280]  yet to be indicted.
[3:10:28.280 --> 3:10:34.680]  So you're talking about somebody that could be the real next Ray Epps, basically?
[3:10:34.680 --> 3:10:35.680]  Correct.
[3:10:35.680 --> 3:10:42.080]  In fact, I'm actually more suspicious of person number 10 than I am about Ray Epps.
[3:10:42.080 --> 3:10:44.600]  Well tell us more about him.
[3:10:44.600 --> 3:10:46.040]  About person number 10?
[3:10:46.040 --> 3:10:47.040]  Yes.
[3:10:47.040 --> 3:10:54.440]  All I know is it was floated to me in late 2019 or early 2020 that Stewart knew this guy
[3:10:54.440 --> 3:11:00.200]  is he went by whip, and he was a former police officer who apparently was railroaded out
[3:11:00.200 --> 3:11:04.760]  of he's a black male, by the way, not that it matters, but I just want you to know.
[3:11:04.760 --> 3:11:06.640]  He was a police officer that apparently was involved.
[3:11:06.640 --> 3:11:09.160]  Oh yeah, he's been in my office with Stewart.
[3:11:09.160 --> 3:11:10.160]  Okay.
[3:11:10.160 --> 3:11:14.400]  He was apparently involved in a bad shooting supposedly that was really legit.
[3:11:14.400 --> 3:11:17.520]  And Stewart was said to be part of the organization.
[3:11:17.520 --> 3:11:21.440]  That was early 2019, I'm sorry, late 2019, early 2020.
[3:11:21.440 --> 3:11:22.440]  Okay.
[3:11:22.440 --> 3:11:25.040]  I don't have no idea anything about him.
[3:11:25.040 --> 3:11:28.800]  No, I mean, that guy gave me the, that's what I like told people I don't want Stewart
[3:11:28.800 --> 3:11:29.800]  Rhodes on the show anymore.
[3:11:29.800 --> 3:11:34.800]  I don't want him around here because Stewart was acting all jacked up and this guy was like
[3:11:34.800 --> 3:11:39.280]  really acting aggressive and really just like really, I don't know how to describe
[3:11:39.280 --> 3:11:44.800]  it, but it's like really, really jacked up and like also looking at me aggressively
[3:11:44.800 --> 3:11:48.600]  and I'm not like somebody just makes up stuff when someone's looking at me like they don't
[3:11:48.600 --> 3:11:52.280]  like me and like, because the left does that when they get around me, they get really crazy
[3:11:52.280 --> 3:11:53.280]  crazy.
[3:11:53.280 --> 3:11:54.280]  And that's what he was doing.
[3:11:54.280 --> 3:11:56.880]  He was like, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[3:11:56.880 --> 3:11:57.880]  I know.
[3:11:57.880 --> 3:12:04.480]  And in this whip, person number 10, was it all three locations and Stewart was pushing
[3:12:04.480 --> 3:12:10.160]  him to be my number two guy in Atlanta when we had, when we were going to be set up, you
[3:12:10.160 --> 3:12:11.160]  know, was that an attempt?
[3:12:11.160 --> 3:12:12.840]  So where's all with these days?
[3:12:12.840 --> 3:12:14.340]  What's he up to?
[3:12:14.340 --> 3:12:15.960]  He's not indicted is all I know.
[3:12:15.960 --> 3:12:16.960]  Yeah, that's him.
[3:12:16.960 --> 3:12:17.960]  I met him.
[3:12:17.960 --> 3:12:18.960]  He's been in the office.
[3:12:18.960 --> 3:12:19.960]  Yeah.
[3:12:19.960 --> 3:12:22.400]  So, so that's my suspicion.
[3:12:22.400 --> 3:12:23.400]  That's my suspicion.
[3:12:23.400 --> 3:12:27.840]  Well, Stewart's involvement with any of that, I have no idea.
[3:12:27.840 --> 3:12:28.840]  I have no idea.
[3:12:28.840 --> 3:12:34.560]  And in fact, I look at my role going forward with this is really just to be kind of oral
[3:12:34.560 --> 3:12:40.200]  history about what had, what occurred before Oath Keepers went rogue and what occurred
[3:12:40.200 --> 3:12:46.360]  that led up to me resigning because I believe that was in the mix when I resigned.
[3:12:46.360 --> 3:12:51.160]  Everything was going on, I sensed it, then what happened at the Atlanta rally was the,
[3:12:51.160 --> 3:12:57.560]  was the nail in the coffin and I got out as I felt it was going rogue and it went rogue.
[3:12:57.560 --> 3:13:01.680]  Now how it went rogue, whether Stewart was actively involved in it going rogue, I don't
[3:13:01.680 --> 3:13:06.600]  know, but it was going rogue and I feel that my story is just a piece of a puzzle.
[3:13:06.600 --> 3:13:10.920]  And so hopefully somebody else out there with more of the pieces of the puzzle, they can
[3:13:10.920 --> 3:13:12.000]  bring their stories out.
[3:13:12.000 --> 3:13:14.760]  So maybe one day we'll actually know what really happened.
[3:13:14.760 --> 3:13:17.200]  Well, absolutely.
[3:13:17.200 --> 3:13:21.120]  And you know, we've all been around former soldiers and people that have been through
[3:13:21.120 --> 3:13:25.040]  a lot and think they're tough and are kind of crazed and into it, but the guy you talk
[3:13:25.040 --> 3:13:27.040]  about, we can put that picture back up on screen.
[3:13:27.040 --> 3:13:28.040]  That's him.
[3:13:28.040 --> 3:13:29.040]  Was it the office?
[3:13:29.040 --> 3:13:30.760]  I remember saying to the crew, I said, no more Stewart Rhodes.
[3:13:30.760 --> 3:13:34.640]  This is like, I don't know, a year ago, whatever it was, but more than a year, it was before
[3:13:34.640 --> 3:13:35.640]  January.
[3:13:35.640 --> 3:13:41.760]  I was just like, I could pick up, you know, the criminal energy, it was just like, this
[3:13:41.760 --> 3:13:45.800]  is not good and it had a really bad feeling, you know what I mean?
[3:13:45.800 --> 3:13:49.400]  And I absolutely, I do, I know what you mean.
[3:13:49.400 --> 3:13:55.400]  I mean, I was around him twice, once in, once in the first DC rally and at the Atlanta
[3:13:55.400 --> 3:13:56.400]  rally.
[3:13:56.400 --> 3:14:04.000]  And when I saw what happened and my team getting set up and then I think back, he wanted his
[3:14:04.000 --> 3:14:11.480]  guy, Stewart wanted his guy with to be my number two when that confrontation took place.
[3:14:11.480 --> 3:14:15.720]  I'm afraid there were, there were somebody at some level was planning for a violent
[3:14:15.720 --> 3:14:19.720]  confrontation that day and it was going to be a flash point for something bigger and
[3:14:19.720 --> 3:14:26.360]  it disgusts me, it angers me and really questions everything about my association with Stewart
[3:14:26.360 --> 3:14:28.040]  Rhodes from the very beginning.
[3:14:28.040 --> 3:14:33.600]  But you, you as a personal opinion feel like this guy could be the handler.
[3:14:33.600 --> 3:14:34.600]  Yes.
[3:14:34.600 --> 3:14:39.480]  Well, I got the heebie-jeebies from him.
[3:14:39.480 --> 3:14:44.000]  You know, I think, I think, I think you're, you're, you're well-served, sir.
[3:14:44.000 --> 3:14:45.720]  Well, yes, sir, to you.
[3:14:45.720 --> 3:14:48.160]  So where do you see this going now?
[3:14:48.160 --> 3:14:53.880]  Well, if, if, if I know Stewart, which maybe I do, maybe I don't, I don't expect him to
[3:14:53.880 --> 3:14:54.880]  plead.
[3:14:54.880 --> 3:14:55.880]  Um, Stewart is.
[3:14:55.880 --> 3:14:56.880]  That's what I told people.
[3:14:56.880 --> 3:14:58.400]  I didn't think Stewart was a fed.
[3:14:58.400 --> 3:15:00.560]  I mean, I told national people this off record.
[3:15:00.560 --> 3:15:02.720]  I'm like, no, he really believes this stuff.
[3:15:02.720 --> 3:15:05.560]  Oh, but see, here's, here's a silver lining.
[3:15:05.560 --> 3:15:12.040]  If Stewart, if, okay, big if, if Stewart is a fed and they've now charged him, that means
[3:15:12.040 --> 3:15:13.040]  they're done with it.
[3:15:13.040 --> 3:15:17.160]  So I'm actually more concerned, concerned about an Epstein situation going forward with
[3:15:17.160 --> 3:15:18.920]  Stewart Rhodes than anything else at this point.
[3:15:18.920 --> 3:15:19.920]  I agree.
[3:15:19.920 --> 3:15:20.920]  Exactly.
[3:15:20.920 --> 3:15:23.160]  If he really is a double agent, which I don't think they're going to kill him, he's more
[3:15:23.160 --> 3:15:24.160]  of a useful idiot.
[3:15:24.160 --> 3:15:26.360]  And I don't mean that meanly a romantic.
[3:15:26.360 --> 3:15:27.880]  You know what I'm saying?
[3:15:27.880 --> 3:15:28.880]  Yeah.
[3:15:28.880 --> 3:15:33.480]  Oh, that's actually probably the best description of Stewart Rhodes that I've ever heard anyone
[3:15:33.480 --> 3:15:34.480]  say, Alex.
[3:15:34.480 --> 3:15:35.480]  He's a romantic.
[3:15:35.480 --> 3:15:36.480]  He's going to be right.
[3:15:36.480 --> 3:15:40.560]  He'd ask me like, aren't you ready or he would never get technical the last few times.
[3:15:40.560 --> 3:15:44.760]  Like, and that guy was there, the black guy, like, look at my aren't you ready?
[3:15:44.760 --> 3:15:45.760]  Aren't you a man?
[3:15:45.760 --> 3:15:46.760]  I'm like, what's going on?
[3:15:46.760 --> 3:15:48.800]  You know, but nothing was ever discovered.
[3:15:48.800 --> 3:15:49.800]  I'm like, what?
[3:15:49.800 --> 3:15:50.800]  No, I'm not.
[3:15:50.800 --> 3:15:51.800]  I don't know.
[3:15:51.800 --> 3:15:52.800]  I want peace.
[3:15:52.800 --> 3:15:54.000]  And so, wow, let's do one more segment on this.
[3:15:54.000 --> 3:15:55.000]  Stay with us.
[3:15:55.000 --> 3:16:02.280]  It's only been in the last 60 years that we've had satellites that can decently measure what's
[3:16:02.280 --> 3:16:03.280]  happening in the atmosphere.
[3:16:03.280 --> 3:16:07.600]  But if you look at all the different studies reports about my NASA and other governments
[3:16:07.600 --> 3:16:12.160]  and other agencies, they all disagree on what's really happening with the climate.
[3:16:12.160 --> 3:16:17.160]  The only constant, the only great truth is change is the only constant.
[3:16:17.160 --> 3:16:22.440]  So, yes, climate change is totally real, but notice first they called it global freezing
[3:16:22.440 --> 3:16:25.800]  back in the 70s and 80s, and then it's going to be global warming, and when that didn't
[3:16:25.800 --> 3:16:29.000]  really happen the way they wanted to, okay, now it's just climate change.
[3:16:29.000 --> 3:16:34.840]  But did you know that man-made climate change is a real thing when it comes to the United
[3:16:34.840 --> 3:16:38.760]  Nations and the Department of Energy and Bill Gates and the UN?
[3:16:38.760 --> 3:16:39.760]  They have.
[3:16:39.760 --> 3:16:44.280]  Weather control trees from 1979, and Bill Gates has been manipulating the weather for
[3:16:44.280 --> 3:16:45.280]  a very long time.
[3:16:45.280 --> 3:16:49.800]  In fact, back in 1974, two scientists won a Nobel Prize for an idea of spraying different
[3:16:49.800 --> 3:16:52.240]  particles out of jet engines to control the weather.
[3:16:52.240 --> 3:16:55.800]  So, yes, man-made climate change is real.
[3:16:55.800 --> 3:17:04.720]  Three very important life-saving words, vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and you find them all
[3:17:04.720 --> 3:17:11.600]  in vitamin, mineral, fusion, all the essential vitamins, all the essential minerals from
[3:17:11.600 --> 3:17:18.960]  really good, high-quality, absorbable sources, and a bunch of key compounds, amino acids,
[3:17:18.960 --> 3:17:23.520]  known to help get the nutrients into your tissues, into your cells.
[3:17:23.520 --> 3:17:26.920]  And despite the fact that the product is going to sell out the next week or so, we're going
[3:17:26.920 --> 3:17:32.040]  to keep it on sale at 50% off for another seven days.
[3:17:32.040 --> 3:17:36.960]  So, again, I am cutting this announcement on the afternoon of January 6, 2022.
[3:17:36.960 --> 3:17:42.000]  We're going to run this for a week, and then we are going to be selling out of this product.
[3:17:42.000 --> 3:17:45.720]  Hopefully, more comes in in the next month or so, because it's the best seller.
[3:17:45.720 --> 3:17:48.600]  And it's something everybody needs for their immune system and their body.

[3:19:00.480 --> 3:19:04.760]  I mean, this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[3:19:04.760 --> 3:19:09.920]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic
[3:19:09.920 --> 3:19:12.480]  in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee.
[3:19:12.480 --> 3:19:15.960]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that, you know, the media calls communists,
[3:19:15.960 --> 3:19:17.240]  but really they're just a commune.
[3:19:17.240 --> 3:19:20.800]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee, and we've got it, and the farmers
[3:19:20.800 --> 3:19:23.680]  don't want the Mexican government to take over, so I actually buy this from the Mexican
[3:19:23.680 --> 3:19:26.840]  rebels, and I've been buying it for, what, 14 years, and the price has never gone up.
[3:19:26.840 --> 3:19:31.560]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more, per pound, and I just
[3:19:31.560 --> 3:19:33.720]  think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[3:19:33.720 --> 3:19:37.360]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas Rebels, literally.
[3:19:37.360 --> 3:19:44.720]  In fact, I'm not going to tell you a little story, um, yeah, I'd like to, okay, you wouldn't
[3:19:44.720 --> 3:19:45.720]  believe it.
[3:19:45.720 --> 3:19:50.240]  So, it's infowarstore.com, and that's how we fund this operation, and if you don't
[3:19:50.240 --> 3:19:57.080]  fund us, you don't want to see it, that's fine.
[3:19:57.080 --> 3:20:17.520]  This is the leading up frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[3:20:17.520 --> 3:20:22.400]  It's Alex Jones.
[3:20:22.400 --> 3:20:39.320]  Let me explain this, the left, the big money, the globalists are engaged in a high-tech
[3:20:39.320 --> 3:20:42.480]  psychological war that's going physical.
[3:20:42.480 --> 3:20:46.520]  They want to make it visible because they're losing, and because their old lies didn't
[3:20:46.520 --> 3:20:52.320]  work, they didn't give up, they tripled and quadrupled down, and so when you see federal
[3:20:52.320 --> 3:20:56.680]  filings against Owen saying he doesn't work for info wars, we want sanctions, we want
[3:20:56.680 --> 3:21:01.800]  perjury charges, he doesn't work with Alex Jones, he wasn't, he didn't have security
[3:21:01.800 --> 3:21:05.400]  on January 6th, he didn't try to stop the invasion of the Capitol, it's all in video
[3:21:05.400 --> 3:21:11.880]  he did, but they're betting that the juries are so dumb and the judges are so corrupt
[3:21:11.880 --> 3:21:12.880]  they can do it.
[3:21:12.880 --> 3:21:15.720]  It's the same thing with the Sandy Hook stuff, barely ever talked about it, not even who
[3:21:15.720 --> 3:21:21.800]  I am, and then the stuff they put in the news, it's like totally twisted lies, it's just,
[3:21:21.800 --> 3:21:29.240]  none of it's even real, but that's not the sign of a winning group, that's the sign
[3:21:29.240 --> 3:21:35.920]  of losers, and so it's up to us that know the truth and love justice to hold the line
[3:21:35.920 --> 3:21:40.480]  like our ancestors and not back down to this, and for those of you that keep us on air and
[3:21:40.480 --> 3:21:43.280]  support us, you are so amazing.
[3:21:43.280 --> 3:21:47.480]  Let's go back to John D. Shirley, retired police officer, one of the founding members
[3:21:47.480 --> 3:21:55.880]  of Oath Keepers, talking about what he saw, and they probably fed Stuart's ego, he probably
[3:21:55.880 --> 3:21:59.640]  had some type of psychosis, and you asked me personally, I don't know this, but where
[3:21:59.640 --> 3:22:03.440]  he changed, I believe it was this messianic figure that would trigger the Second American
[3:22:03.440 --> 3:22:09.640]  Civil War, and he got walked by feds as one of the groups, along with cue followers and
[3:22:09.640 --> 3:22:18.560]  anti addressed up like Trump supporters, to break into the capitol, they arrested Henry
[3:22:18.560 --> 3:22:22.040]  Cattario, the head of Proud Boys, because he wasn't going to support an attack, they
[3:22:22.040 --> 3:22:27.000]  slipped their federal agent in there, we know that, and so they, this was very well played
[3:22:27.000 --> 3:22:34.040]  using psychology, and that's where we are now, the question is was Rhodes working for
[3:22:34.040 --> 3:22:40.640]  them, I don't think so, I think he was set up, but the bottom line is, everything is
[3:22:40.640 --> 3:22:45.160]  January 6th now, as the New York Times said in that headline, every day is January 6th,
[3:22:45.160 --> 3:22:48.840]  they're betting everything they're doing, their censorship, their lock downs, their
[3:22:48.840 --> 3:22:56.200]  tyranny, their control, on leveraging January 6th, as we're all terrorists, and that's why
[3:22:56.200 --> 3:23:02.080]  it's good to see the Republicans in Congress and the leader of the Republicans in the Senate
[3:23:02.080 --> 3:23:06.760]  saying they're branding the Republicans as terrorists, they're trying to ban our party,
[3:23:06.760 --> 3:23:11.560]  this is outrageous, they finally get it, John D. Shirley, so I want to get your final
[3:23:11.560 --> 3:23:15.400]  in the six minutes we have left, any other points you'd like to make?
[3:23:15.400 --> 3:23:22.200]  Well, I think if you've listened to our story about the NTIFA in Atlanta, I told you that
[3:23:22.200 --> 3:23:27.600]  I thought that NTIFA Atlanta, or the people they have there for that rally, was like a
[3:23:27.600 --> 3:23:33.840]  mess, and maybe the right way to look at it is what's being overlaid with Oathkeepers
[3:23:33.840 --> 3:23:38.600]  on January 6th, what's being overlaid with the name and brand Oathkeepers on January
[3:23:38.600 --> 3:23:42.280]  6th, is actually also a lark.
[3:23:42.280 --> 3:23:48.480]  Whatever happened, whatever the organization was prior to January 6th, it was turned into
[3:23:48.480 --> 3:23:54.560]  something else on January 6th, if indeed, anything what they said in the farcical, in
[3:23:54.560 --> 3:23:58.880]  my opinion, indictment, if any of that's actually true.
[3:23:58.880 --> 3:24:06.040]  Well, I totally agree with you, and you know, it's insane that I didn't even ask who that
[3:24:06.040 --> 3:24:11.520]  guy was, I met him, and he was here with a woman, and then that guy, and I just, my alarms
[3:24:11.520 --> 3:24:13.080]  went completely off of that fella.
[3:24:13.080 --> 3:24:17.560]  Well, here's the real question, where do we go from here, Alex, okay, because I actually
[3:24:17.560 --> 3:24:22.680]  believe that the reason the Oathkeepers was set up is still just as relevant today, actually
[3:24:22.680 --> 3:24:24.880]  more so than it was in 2009.
[3:24:24.880 --> 3:24:29.320]  Now, I'm not advocating that someone else needs to step up and take the reins of Oathkeepers
[3:24:29.320 --> 3:24:30.320]  and charge forward.
[3:24:30.320 --> 3:24:35.120]  I agree, we shouldn't demonize the main mission Oathkeepers, it was a great idea.
[3:24:35.120 --> 3:24:40.920]  Exactly, and peace officers, more than even in 2009, need to pull out their constitutions
[3:24:40.920 --> 3:24:45.680]  and read it, and take the scales off their eyes, and make sure they're doing the will
[3:24:45.680 --> 3:24:46.680]  of the people.
[3:24:46.680 --> 3:24:51.200]  Well, Hitler knew his main enemy was the military and police, that's Operation Valkyrie.
[3:24:51.200 --> 3:24:56.600]  So exactly, they know the real Achilles' Hill they have is the military and police following
[3:24:56.600 --> 3:25:00.880]  their oath, and so that's why it was so key for them to infiltrate or whatever they did
[3:25:00.880 --> 3:25:01.880]  with Oathkeepers.
[3:25:01.880 --> 3:25:09.200]  Exactly, and one of the reasons why Stuart knew the government was so distrusting of
[3:25:09.200 --> 3:25:15.360]  Oathkeepers is because we always projected, and we said, and we always believed that for
[3:25:15.360 --> 3:25:21.360]  everyone dues-paying Oathkeeper, there's probably 10 or 20 peace officers and soldiers that
[3:25:21.360 --> 3:25:27.400]  know about us, and know that what we say is true, and that are actually really members.
[3:25:27.400 --> 3:25:32.880]  So the important thing is the message, the message gets out, and it's very widespread,
[3:25:32.880 --> 3:25:35.560]  and that's what the government fears, because they can't control it.
[3:25:35.560 --> 3:25:37.720]  Well, because they can't control it.
[3:25:37.720 --> 3:25:42.640]  My gut is, Stuart got desperate, his wife divorced him, he fell apart, he almost lost
[3:25:42.640 --> 3:25:47.240]  everything, and then he just suddenly, oh, here's this money, here's these guys, they're
[3:25:47.240 --> 3:25:52.960]  going to help you, and they knew how to psychologically manipulate him, and the rest is history.
[3:25:52.960 --> 3:25:59.080]  Well, when he and I were talking in 2019 and 2020, he was just this side of homeless, and
[3:25:59.080 --> 3:26:04.800]  I'm not saying that to be mean, I'm saying it because it helps explain maybe his situation.
[3:26:04.800 --> 3:26:14.000]  Yeah, Stuart is a good man and a romantic, and you can see his perspective, a globalist
[3:26:14.000 --> 3:26:19.200]  takeover, a stolen election, hey, let's be George Washington, but we're not in 1776,
[3:26:19.200 --> 3:26:22.720]  that doesn't work now, and he got set up by these people, I think that's really the best
[3:26:22.720 --> 3:26:23.720]  analysis we've got.
[3:26:23.720 --> 3:26:28.400]  That's why I told my crew off record, I said, no, Stuart's not a fed, Stuart's a romantic
[3:26:28.400 --> 3:26:31.560]  being set up by feds, and we now know what happened.
[3:26:31.560 --> 3:26:39.040]  And I want to be really clear, I resigned the organization on November 24, 2020, at
[3:26:39.040 --> 3:26:45.520]  no time, on or before that date, at anybody in the organization that I was aware of, or
[3:26:45.520 --> 3:26:50.960]  involved with the organization in any way, had said anything about taking on the government
[3:26:50.960 --> 3:26:55.600]  on January 6, there was no talk, nothing I heard.
[3:26:55.600 --> 3:27:01.480]  So if it was happening, it was happening behind the scenes, or it was happening among the
[3:27:01.480 --> 3:27:04.480]  fed handlers, and just waiting to roll it out, I don't know.
[3:27:04.480 --> 3:27:08.520]  But there was no talk of it, that would have been a ridiculous notion had someone brought
[3:27:08.520 --> 3:27:09.920]  that up in my presence.
[3:27:09.920 --> 3:27:16.520]  Well, yeah, attacking the capitals, the last thing you do in an insurrection, I mean, it
[3:27:16.520 --> 3:27:19.640]  was a PR victory for the enemy.
[3:27:19.640 --> 3:27:25.480]  If what they laid out in this indictment, Alex, is true, well then, honestly, Stuart
[3:27:25.480 --> 3:27:29.720]  Rhodes deserves to be found not guilty by reason of insanity, because if that was his
[3:27:29.720 --> 3:27:32.880]  plan, if that was his plan, that's insanity.
[3:27:32.880 --> 3:27:34.240]  It's primal facia insanity.
[3:27:34.240 --> 3:27:40.440]  You can read their indictment and say, if they're being honest and true in this, Stuart's nuts.
[3:27:40.440 --> 3:27:42.000]  That's the point where he's not responsible for it.
[3:27:42.000 --> 3:27:43.000]  Absolutely.
[3:27:43.000 --> 3:27:44.400]  I mean, you talk about it exactly.
[3:27:44.400 --> 3:27:45.400]  This is crazy.
[3:27:45.400 --> 3:27:46.400]  All right.
[3:27:46.400 --> 3:27:47.400]  All right.
[3:27:47.400 --> 3:27:51.520]  Well, John D. Shirley, please come on our other shows, give us updates, reach out to us,
[3:27:51.520 --> 3:27:54.120]  and thank you so much for coming on, and God bless you.
[3:27:54.120 --> 3:27:55.120]  Thank you for having me, Alex.
[3:27:55.120 --> 3:27:57.000]  People need to check out the Blue Shark Show.
[3:27:57.000 --> 3:28:01.280]  I'm doing a local version of Alex Jones taking the task, your local crooks, the Blue Shark
[3:28:01.280 --> 3:28:02.280]  Show on YouTube.
[3:28:02.280 --> 3:28:03.280]  Yeah.
[3:28:03.280 --> 3:28:05.200]  Well, I mean, I've seen your show before.
[3:28:05.200 --> 3:28:07.080]  You cover national stuff too, right?
[3:28:07.080 --> 3:28:12.960]  Well, I'm actually, they cover what some of the goings on of the office on that show.
[3:28:12.960 --> 3:28:17.920]  Those are some good Patriot friends of mine who take the task, the local swamp in Hood
[3:28:17.920 --> 3:28:18.920]  County.
[3:28:18.920 --> 3:28:22.800]  So people want to know how you drive the swamp out of your county, go look at the Blue Shark
[3:28:22.800 --> 3:28:23.800]  Show.
[3:28:23.800 --> 3:28:26.360]  They'll show you how you drive the swamp out of your county, because we're driving that
[3:28:26.360 --> 3:28:29.720]  swamp out of our county, and I'm going to do the swamp creatures in my county a favor
[3:28:29.720 --> 3:28:31.600]  and not even name them on your show.
[3:28:31.600 --> 3:28:34.680]  But they know who they are, so everybody needs to check out Blue Shark Show.
[3:28:34.680 --> 3:28:35.680]  That's how you take your local crooks.
[3:28:35.680 --> 3:28:36.680]  That's beautiful.
[3:28:36.680 --> 3:28:37.680]  Yeah.
[3:28:37.680 --> 3:28:38.680]  We do it with information, not with violence.
[3:28:38.680 --> 3:28:39.680]  All right.
[3:28:39.680 --> 3:28:40.680]  Thank you, John D. Shirley.
[3:28:40.680 --> 3:28:41.680]  Thank you.
[3:28:41.680 --> 3:28:42.680]  All right.
[3:28:42.680 --> 3:28:50.600]  I got some final news to hit before Owen Schroeder takes over, and he's got Dr. Darren Beattie
[3:28:50.600 --> 3:28:55.680]  on his show today.
[3:28:55.680 --> 3:29:01.640]  I am recording this announcement on the afternoon of January 6, 2022, and that means there are
[3:29:01.640 --> 3:29:07.240]  only seven days left of us being able to offer our best-selling product, Vitamin Mineral
[3:29:07.240 --> 3:29:10.240]  Fusion, at 50% off.
[3:29:10.240 --> 3:29:14.480]  It has all the vitamins, all the minerals, incredible amino acids.
[3:29:14.480 --> 3:29:19.000]  It is a game changer for your immune system and every other function in your body, and
[3:29:19.000 --> 3:29:20.000]  it's a must-have.
[3:29:20.000 --> 3:29:24.920]  That's why, despite the fact that it's selling out at current sales rates, we're going to
[3:29:24.920 --> 3:29:29.280]  keep it on sale for another seven days.
[3:29:29.280 --> 3:29:34.200]  So we're running this until next Thursday, and your purchase supports the broadcast.
[3:29:34.200 --> 3:29:37.680]  I want to thank you all for shopping with InfoWars.
[3:29:37.680 --> 3:29:41.520]  Without you, it would not have been on air, and the world would be a much worse position
[3:29:41.520 --> 3:29:43.120]  right now that it's in.
[3:29:43.120 --> 3:29:47.600]  Thanks to you supporting InfoWars, we have now become the number one beacon of truth
[3:29:47.600 --> 3:29:50.400]  exposing the great reset and the new world order.

[3:29:53.680 --> 3:29:55.400]  same time at InfoWarsStore.com.
[3:29:55.400 --> 3:29:59.920]  I never compromise the quality of ingredients we put in InfoWars Live products, and that's

[3:30:55.280 --> 3:31:00.080]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist.
[3:31:00.080 --> 3:31:02.120]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[3:31:02.120 --> 3:31:07.840]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational,
[3:31:07.840 --> 3:31:08.840]  but we failed.
[3:31:08.840 --> 3:31:10.280]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[3:31:10.280 --> 3:31:16.080]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat-footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational
[3:31:16.080 --> 3:31:20.560]  deindustrialization great reset, and that's why it's more important than ever that all
[3:31:20.560 --> 3:31:25.240]  viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show because people are ready
[3:31:25.240 --> 3:31:27.360]  to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[3:31:27.360 --> 3:31:30.680]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and try to stop their agenda, but we've
[3:31:30.680 --> 3:31:34.480]  also got to get personally prepared, and one of the number one things to do is high quality
[3:31:34.480 --> 3:31:35.480]  storeable food.

[3:31:55.800 --> 3:32:00.680]  Everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has only been the buildup for what
[3:32:00.680 --> 3:32:02.640]  the globalists are doing right now.
[3:32:02.640 --> 3:32:04.360]  This is their big offensive.
[3:32:04.360 --> 3:32:07.880]  This is their takeover, and this is the point that they're at their very weakest because
[3:32:07.880 --> 3:32:09.760]  now they've revealed themselves.
[3:32:09.760 --> 3:32:13.800]  Now they're a world government, they're permanent martial law, their medical tyranny is out
[3:32:13.800 --> 3:32:18.840]  in the open, their depopulation agenda has been exposed, but they're using their corporate
[3:32:18.840 --> 3:32:23.600]  power and trillions to go across the planet and shut down people telling the truth.
[3:32:23.600 --> 3:32:26.880]  So listen, Paul Revere's, when you spread the word about the broadcast, when you pray
[3:32:26.880 --> 3:32:31.520]  for the broadcast, you're the tip of the spear, and when you buy products at infowarstore.com,

[3:33:08.400 --> 3:33:11.080]  Waging war on corruption.
[3:33:11.080 --> 3:33:18.880]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[3:33:18.880 --> 3:33:30.040]  Well, I don't say this to get you to marvel at me, but I tell you we're in a lot of trouble
[3:33:30.040 --> 3:33:34.760]  because I'm about the best we've got, it's really true.
[3:33:34.760 --> 3:33:37.560]  And I've learned about the dark side of the New World Order, I've learned about their
[3:33:37.560 --> 3:33:45.360]  dirty tricks I've learned about, that gun kicks as hard as it shoots, as I say in Texas.
[3:33:45.360 --> 3:33:58.880]  That old Wisconsin sand, they shot at me and missed, they SH dash teed me and hit.
[3:33:58.880 --> 3:34:04.720]  You know, I've got some really big news to cover that I meant to cover yesterday, but
[3:34:04.720 --> 3:34:11.040]  it's so important, I just, man, I should make a big deal about this, I shouldn't just put
[3:34:11.040 --> 3:34:14.800]  this out, you know what I mean, because we just put this out, it has no effect.
[3:34:14.800 --> 3:34:19.560]  I'm going to play this next clip to start with the next segment.
[3:34:19.560 --> 3:34:27.960]  The Dutch Prime Minister confronted by one of the members of parliament about, hey, you
[3:34:27.960 --> 3:34:28.960]  heard of Klaus Schwab?
[3:34:28.960 --> 3:34:34.400]  Oh no, I don't know who he is, heard of his book, great reset, no, what's that?
[3:34:34.400 --> 3:34:41.280]  Oh well, you wrote the forward to it, oh, you were saying 9-11 didn't happen, I mean
[3:34:41.280 --> 3:34:48.400]  this is actual video of one of Klaus Schwab's agents who went to his Bilderberg graduation
[3:34:48.400 --> 3:34:56.600]  school telling someone, gaslighting him, I don't suspect you, it doesn't exist.
[3:34:56.600 --> 3:35:01.160]  He's like, you wrote the forward to his book, and everybody's sure it's laughing in the
[3:35:01.160 --> 3:35:10.040]  room, because they are all in on it, folks.
[3:35:10.040 --> 3:35:12.040]  Total dishonor.
[3:35:12.040 --> 3:35:17.400]  So listen, I've already, you know, the bigger the show, the shows have been giant, we have
[3:35:17.400 --> 3:35:21.120]  an extra couple million viewers a day, thanks to all you spread the links and the interest
[3:35:21.120 --> 3:35:25.520]  in the show, so like 3 million, because everybody exaggerates numbers, but we don't exaggerate,
[3:35:25.520 --> 3:35:29.520]  we got 3 million people on threshold radio a day tuning in on average, and we got over
[3:35:29.520 --> 3:35:33.960]  2 million tuning in on our streams, and thanks to Band-Aid video, but it's been double that
[3:35:33.960 --> 3:35:35.960]  the last few weeks.
[3:35:35.960 --> 3:35:41.200]  I really respect the 7, 8, 9, 10 million people tuned in, I love every day I'm one of you,
[3:35:41.200 --> 3:35:46.520]  I mean I mean that, I just want you to have a great life and a great future and I'm fighting
[3:35:46.520 --> 3:35:51.000]  hard for you, but I'm going to be honest with you, I'm not doing it for you man, I'm doing
[3:35:51.000 --> 3:35:55.440]  it because I hate these people, I'm like a dog wants to, you wonder why a dog wants
[3:35:55.440 --> 3:35:59.400]  to chase a squirrel, he don't know why, I just want to do it, so don't think I'm doing
[3:35:59.400 --> 3:36:07.000]  it because I'm some hero, these people are garbage, and all I got is I want to stop them
[3:36:07.000 --> 3:36:14.160]  so damn bad, I'll do anything to do it, anything that doesn't hurt innocent people, if it hurts
[3:36:14.160 --> 3:36:22.000]  me I'll do it, and man I've already seen our effect, it has been together, what we've
[3:36:22.000 --> 3:36:29.000]  done has changed the world, and it's been so incredible, but I don't sit there and
[3:36:29.000 --> 3:36:37.600]  feel good when I watch the Justice Department file a case against Owen and lie about him,
[3:36:37.600 --> 3:36:42.000]  I don't feel good like, oh I get to be the high and mighty person, I'm going to go on
[3:36:42.000 --> 3:36:47.120]  air and see how the FBI and the Justice Department are bad, that makes me feel better than them,
[3:36:47.120 --> 3:36:53.320]  that I'm bigger than them, no it makes me go, how the hell do they find this many evil
[3:36:53.320 --> 3:37:05.840]  people, I mean maybe we are an evil species, so I'll hit this big news, fight back against
[3:37:05.840 --> 3:37:10.400]  the great reset, now our politicians are owned and bought by this criminal syndicate next
[3:37:10.400 --> 3:37:17.880]  segment, but look at this article, you just heard last week that I got 156 million dollars
[3:37:17.880 --> 3:37:25.240]  in the bank, I wish I did, ain't that much now, 156 million dollars, 20 years ago it
[3:37:25.240 --> 3:37:30.680]  was about 5 million dollars, that's how devalued stuff is, but I don't have a million dollars
[3:37:30.680 --> 3:37:40.920]  personally in my bank account, we tried to file sanctions because we have a protective
[3:37:40.920 --> 3:37:47.280]  order to protect our banking info and all our information, and it's signed, it's in
[3:37:47.280 --> 3:37:52.960]  the court and they don't care, they just leaked it all to the news, so we twisted by the way,
[3:37:52.960 --> 3:37:57.080]  so we go, we try to have a hearing and the judge goes I'm not going to hear that, I'm
[3:37:57.080 --> 3:38:05.240]  going to sanction you again, I'm a Democrat party Yale person and you're a bad American,
[3:38:05.240 --> 3:38:18.720]  so I'm going to do this to you, we're like okay, and now it's not 156 million I'm worth,
[3:38:18.720 --> 3:38:26.600]  it's 6.2 million dollars I'm worth, and they even count debt I owe to a bank as money,
[3:38:26.600 --> 3:38:35.320]  and then they say it gets better, oh, oh, you have inventory, and that's what they've
[3:38:35.320 --> 3:38:40.160]  told us, they said hey you could pay 10 million dollars to Sandy Hook people for questioning
[3:38:40.160 --> 3:38:44.720]  media lies or media reports, and we're like we don't have 10 million dollars, well you
[3:38:44.720 --> 3:38:50.800]  got product, and see that's how it works, I've got to buy product 6 months a year out
[3:38:50.800 --> 3:38:56.120]  now, used to it was 3 months out, to have product to sell, so I'm always at the point
[3:38:56.120 --> 3:39:00.680]  of like was always on the edge of being shut down, so I'm like do I spend the money we've
[3:39:00.680 --> 3:39:07.200]  got to buy product and hope will be here, or do I not, they're like well you got millions
[3:39:07.200 --> 3:39:14.760]  of dollars of product there, you got a warehouse with water filters and storeable food and
[3:39:14.760 --> 3:39:20.920]  supplements and t-shirts, and they're like why don't you just give that to us, and we
[3:39:20.920 --> 3:39:26.560]  literally approach them and go do you have any basic like 5 year old math skills, if
[3:39:26.560 --> 3:39:32.640]  we're making 30-40% on a product sale, and we've got these bills to pay even if we wanted
[3:39:32.640 --> 3:39:38.280]  to pay you people, but notice you're not stupid right audience you know this, you heard everywhere
[3:39:38.280 --> 3:39:44.160]  we didn't give them anything, we never gave them a document, but they've got every banking
[3:39:44.160 --> 3:39:48.840]  document, they've got everything about us because I knew they were doing this, I'm
[3:39:48.840 --> 3:39:51.880]  like here it is, and then they go he didn't give us anything, we've got all your banking
[3:39:51.880 --> 3:39:58.160]  records, we've got everything on you right now, we're going to destroy you, none of it
[3:39:58.160 --> 3:40:07.720]  even matches up with reality, and so I bring in lawyers and I say I want, people blame
[3:40:07.720 --> 3:40:11.360]  my lawyers, most of the time it's not their fault, they're like you're on or we'd like
[3:40:11.360 --> 3:40:15.840]  to file a complaint that you did a protective order and I was supposed to release these
[3:40:15.840 --> 3:40:21.600]  documents plus they released them incorrectly and they're like oh no that's not what's
[3:40:21.600 --> 3:40:29.960]  happening you get more sanctions, and again I don't sit there and go poor me I'm under
[3:40:29.960 --> 3:40:35.560]  attack, now I'm not some 7 year old kid napped in Mexico and took across the Texas border
[3:40:35.560 --> 3:40:40.600]  to be gang raped up to 100 dudes a day, and the FBI knows about that it's on record, no
[3:40:40.600 --> 3:40:46.960]  no I'm not a little kid getting gang raped, I'm doing awesome, I'm big, I'm strong, hell
[3:40:46.960 --> 3:40:51.680]  I'm built for this, I actually kind of like it, but I'll tell you this it pisses me off
[3:40:51.680 --> 3:40:55.960]  because we're trying to protect the children and this is the crap we do, so I just pray
[3:40:55.960 --> 3:41:02.560]  in the name of Jesus that God bring justice on these people because it is so sick to watch
[3:41:02.560 --> 3:41:09.600]  the total inversion of reality and it's so filthy, oh look I'm not worth 156 million,
[3:41:09.600 --> 3:41:16.200]  that was last week, now it's 6.2, so they're getting it down and they go, Jones's private
[3:41:16.200 --> 3:41:22.240]  bank account has 400,000, like I told you, which ain't that much in a fight like this,
[3:41:22.240 --> 3:41:26.880]  so and they're like but he's got a couple million in inventory and why his equipment
[3:41:26.880 --> 3:41:33.720]  we think's worth 4 million, he got 6 million dollars, we want the 6 million dollars for
[3:41:33.720 --> 3:41:42.480]  our jury because you questioned us, that doesn't make me feel sick for myself, it makes me
[3:41:42.480 --> 3:41:49.840]  feel sick for America, because I've got my integrity and I've got the fact that, I mean
[3:41:49.840 --> 3:41:55.440]  you know, as a man I can't help it, the fight, I kick like a mule, I buy it like a crocodile,
[3:41:55.440 --> 3:42:00.440]  I mean I'm a man, but a lot of guys beat my ass, but they're gonna know they're gonna
[3:42:00.440 --> 3:42:05.120]  know they're in a fight and I'm just telling you, everything I am is on the line for this
[3:42:05.120 --> 3:42:12.160]  country and I get this watch, a rigged system, rape and screw and lie and say Owen Shroyer
[3:42:12.160 --> 3:42:19.360]  attacked the capital in federal filings, the FBI and that he doesn't work here, it's the
[3:42:19.360 --> 3:42:26.720]  same thing here, lies and fraud and corruption is just the veins of these people, it's everything
[3:42:26.720 --> 3:42:31.920]  they are, but you know God's real and they're gonna pay for what they've done, from God
[3:42:31.920 --> 3:42:39.320]  not from us, but I haven't plugged in this whole 3 plus hours, 3 hours and 42 minutes
[3:42:39.320 --> 3:42:43.920]  I've been on air and I've not plugged the products, but yeah, I need your help, I need
[3:42:43.920 --> 3:42:49.200]  money, the great part about this is, when it's all said and done I'm not gonna have
[3:42:49.200 --> 3:43:15.600]  nothing, these leeches ain't gonna get nothing, it all goes to the fight.
[3:43:15.600 --> 3:43:45.320]  This is
[3:43:45.320 --> 3:43:47.880]  makes your life so much healthier and better.
[3:43:47.880 --> 3:43:52.720]  So get your supply up to date at infowarstore.com right now.
[3:43:54.940 --> 3:43:59.380]  I am a worldly person, meaning I like going to ball games,
[3:43:59.380 --> 3:44:02.080]  I like going to concerts, I like going to play golf,
[3:44:02.080 --> 3:44:03.520]  I like going out to dinner.
[3:44:03.520 --> 3:44:05.520]  I like the metropolitan life,
[3:44:05.520 --> 3:44:07.880]  I like everything that comes with this.
[3:44:07.880 --> 3:44:10.840]  But see, I have the survival instinct
[3:44:10.840 --> 3:44:13.920]  that is to get the hell out of Democrat run cities,
[3:44:13.920 --> 3:44:16.680]  get the hell out of major metropolitan areas,
[3:44:16.680 --> 3:44:20.160]  because unless we change course soon, it's all crashing down.
[3:44:20.160 --> 3:44:22.040]  Is it time to just move out to the woods,
[3:44:22.040 --> 3:44:24.120]  just time to go get a piece of property in the woods,
[3:44:24.120 --> 3:44:26.560]  just get off grid, just get the emergency food supplies,
[3:44:26.560 --> 3:44:27.640]  just live off the land?
[3:44:27.640 --> 3:44:29.040]  That's the survival instinct.
[3:44:29.040 --> 3:44:30.600]  But see, the worldly part of me,
[3:44:30.600 --> 3:44:32.360]  that's still probably the majority part of me,
[3:44:32.360 --> 3:44:34.840]  says no, no, no, no, no, stay in the city.
[3:44:34.840 --> 3:44:36.280]  The survival instinct says,
[3:44:36.280 --> 3:44:38.080]  get the hell out of anywhere there's ever notion
[3:44:38.080 --> 3:44:39.840]  that you need to get a vaccine or a mask.
[3:44:39.840 --> 3:44:42.040]  That's the internal struggle,

[3:46:21.840 --> 3:46:24.400]  then it's got added magnesium and potassium
[3:46:24.400 --> 3:46:25.240]  for electrolytes.
[3:46:25.240 --> 3:46:28.400]  It's got real organic cocoa bean powder

[3:46:57.440 --> 3:47:00.240]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[3:47:00.240 --> 3:47:03.840]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:47:03.840 --> 3:47:07.240]  All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[3:47:07.240 --> 3:47:10.240]  it's the final segment of the Alex Jones show
[3:47:10.240 --> 3:47:13.240]  on January 14, 2022.
[3:47:13.240 --> 3:47:16.640]  And my flesh is exhausted,
[3:47:16.640 --> 3:47:21.040]  but my spirit has never been stronger.
[3:47:21.040 --> 3:47:26.040]  All right, so there was major damage control this week
[3:47:26.040 --> 3:47:27.440]  dealing with this.
[3:47:27.440 --> 3:47:31.440]  The Dutch Prime Minister is a graduate
[3:47:31.440 --> 3:47:33.840]  of Klaus Schwab's Bilderberg School.
[3:47:33.840 --> 3:47:36.240]  You'll look it up for yourself, don't believe me.
[3:47:36.240 --> 3:47:38.440]  And he wrote one of the quotes
[3:47:38.440 --> 3:47:41.040]  from the book, The Dutch Prime Minister,
[3:47:41.040 --> 3:47:43.040]  and he wrote one of the quotes
[3:47:43.040 --> 3:47:46.040]  from the book, The Dutch Prime Minister,
[3:47:46.040 --> 3:47:48.040]  and he wrote one of the quotes
[3:47:48.040 --> 3:47:50.040]  from the book, The Dutch Prime Minister,
[3:47:50.040 --> 3:47:52.040]  and he wrote one of the quotes
[3:47:52.040 --> 3:47:55.040]  for the Dutch version.
[3:47:55.040 --> 3:47:57.040]  Yeah, they're all together giving each other awards.
[3:47:57.040 --> 3:47:59.040]  Oh, I'm screaming, great job.
[3:47:59.040 --> 3:48:00.040]  I've never seen this.
[3:48:00.040 --> 3:48:03.040]  So here they are giving each other awards.
[3:48:03.040 --> 3:48:05.040]  And then when one of the members of parliament
[3:48:05.040 --> 3:48:08.040]  confronts him for the lockdowns and the tyranny
[3:48:08.040 --> 3:48:10.040]  and what they're doing, he says,
[3:48:10.040 --> 3:48:12.040]  oh, I don't know who Klaus Schwab is.
[3:48:12.040 --> 3:48:14.040]  I don't know who the Bilderberg group is.
[3:48:14.040 --> 3:48:17.040]  I don't know about the Great Reset
[3:48:17.040 --> 3:48:20.040]  and the member of parliament, who's a great patriot,
[3:48:20.040 --> 3:48:22.040]  let me give him on the show, speaking German,
[3:48:22.040 --> 3:48:27.040]  which is Dutch, a Dutch derivation of German.
[3:48:27.040 --> 3:48:29.040]  He says, he catches him, he goes,
[3:48:29.040 --> 3:48:31.040]  oh, you know who Klaus Schwab is in his book?
[3:48:31.040 --> 3:48:33.040]  No, don't know about that.
[3:48:33.040 --> 3:48:36.040]  I'm just like his butt buddy and right forward to his book
[3:48:36.040 --> 3:48:38.040]  and give him awards and get awards from him
[3:48:38.040 --> 3:48:40.040]  and a graduate of a school.
[3:48:40.040 --> 3:48:42.040]  It's like asking Roger Stalback,
[3:48:42.040 --> 3:48:44.040]  you know about the Dallas Cowboys?
[3:48:44.040 --> 3:48:45.040]  Oh, I don't know anything.
[3:48:45.040 --> 3:48:55.040]  It's like asking the current quarterback of the Buccaneers.
[3:48:55.040 --> 3:48:58.040]  Do you know anything about the New England Patriots?
[3:48:58.040 --> 3:49:05.040]  And he's like, no, I know nothing about the New England Patriots.
[3:49:05.040 --> 3:49:07.040]  Or asking Terry Bradshaw,
[3:49:07.040 --> 3:49:09.040]  do you know about the Pittsburgh Steelers?
[3:49:09.040 --> 3:49:13.040]  And Terry Bradshaw says, what are the Pittsburgh Steelers?
[3:49:13.040 --> 3:49:15.040]  Are they stealing something?
[3:49:15.040 --> 3:49:19.040]  No, they make steel, they pour steel.
[3:49:19.040 --> 3:49:22.040]  So again, that's the disrespect of the enemy
[3:49:22.040 --> 3:49:26.040]  that they never respond to you in any way.
[3:49:26.040 --> 3:49:28.040]  Yeah, they give each other awards.
[3:49:28.040 --> 3:49:30.040]  Yeah, they write forwards to their books.
[3:49:30.040 --> 3:49:32.040]  Yeah, he's the prime minister of the Netherlands.
[3:49:32.040 --> 3:49:34.040]  Yeah, he's confronted.
[3:49:34.040 --> 3:49:38.040]  And he tells his constituents, I don't know who he is.
[3:49:38.040 --> 3:49:40.040]  He should be removed from office now.
[3:49:40.040 --> 3:49:42.040]  He shut their economy down.
[3:49:42.040 --> 3:49:45.040]  He put them under martial law to train to be slaves
[3:49:45.040 --> 3:49:50.040]  where he sits there smiling about the criminal operation they've launched.
[3:49:50.040 --> 3:49:55.040]  And it's that arrogant jerk attitude at the Justice Department
[3:49:55.040 --> 3:50:03.040]  and at the UN and everywhere that's killing us.
[3:50:03.040 --> 3:50:06.040]  So I will try my best, though.
[3:50:06.040 --> 3:50:10.040]  They talk fast to read the subtitles for radio listeners,
[3:50:10.040 --> 3:50:13.040]  you can find the video, but look, oh, fat check.
[3:50:13.040 --> 3:50:17.040]  World Economic Forum letters show 51st annual meeting invites.
[3:50:17.040 --> 3:50:19.040]  And the letter, you can read it yourself, say,
[3:50:19.040 --> 3:50:23.040]  you have done well, continue lockdowns, we are the dominating planet,
[3:50:23.040 --> 3:50:25.040]  soon we will be in full control.
[3:50:25.040 --> 3:50:27.040]  People are like, oh, my God, look at these letters.
[3:50:27.040 --> 3:50:29.040]  They're like, oh, well, they don't really mean that.
[3:50:29.040 --> 3:50:32.040]  I mean, you know, everything's fine.
[3:50:32.040 --> 3:50:37.040]  Invites to the Davos show direct collusion between the W.E.F.
[3:50:37.040 --> 3:50:39.040]  World Economic Forum and the Dutch government.
[3:50:39.040 --> 3:50:43.040]  And so finally the Dutch leader, their president,
[3:50:43.040 --> 3:50:48.040]  their prime minister is confronted and this is what he says.
[3:50:48.040 --> 3:50:51.040]  I'm going to have to stop it and start it so I can read this to you,
[3:50:51.040 --> 3:50:53.040]  but it's incredible. Here it is.
[3:50:53.040 --> 3:50:55.040]  This is Mr. Klaus Schwab.
[3:50:55.040 --> 3:50:57.040]  Back it up.
[3:50:57.040 --> 3:50:59.040]  These guys talk fast. They got talked fast.
[3:50:59.040 --> 3:51:02.040]  One of these globalists is Mr. Klaus Schwab.
[3:51:02.040 --> 3:51:03.040]  Continue.
[3:51:03.040 --> 3:51:05.040]  This is Mr. Klaus Schwab.
[3:51:05.040 --> 3:51:07.040]  Founder and chairman of the World Economic Forum,
[3:51:07.040 --> 3:51:16.040]  and he wrote a book with the catchy title COVID-19 Great Reset.
[3:51:16.040 --> 3:51:21.040]  That's all true.
[3:51:21.040 --> 3:51:33.040]  My question to the PM is, how does he judge the content of this book?
[3:51:33.040 --> 3:51:35.040]  I do not know this book.
[3:51:35.040 --> 3:51:39.040]  He wrote the Frickin Forward.
[3:51:39.040 --> 3:51:41.040]  Again.
[3:51:41.040 --> 3:51:43.040]  Who's the current Dallas Cowboys quarterback?
[3:51:43.040 --> 3:51:45.040]  I mean, I don't even follow it.
[3:51:45.040 --> 3:51:49.040]  I was Tony Romo before. Who's the new guy?
[3:51:49.040 --> 3:51:55.040]  But the point is, this is like literally,
[3:51:55.040 --> 3:51:57.040]  I just can't believe the gaslighting.
[3:51:57.040 --> 3:51:59.040]  I'm sorry, I'm going to stop doing the football analogies.
[3:51:59.040 --> 3:52:01.040]  I haven't watched football anymore.
[3:52:01.040 --> 3:52:03.040]  Let's start this over.
[3:52:03.040 --> 3:52:06.040]  He's written the forward to the book for the Dutch version.
[3:52:06.040 --> 3:52:08.040]  That comes out.
[3:52:08.040 --> 3:52:10.040]  He gets awards from him.
[3:52:10.040 --> 3:52:12.040]  He doesn't know who he is.
[3:52:12.040 --> 3:52:16.040]  Let's continue.
[3:52:16.040 --> 3:52:19.040]  I do not know this book,
[3:52:19.040 --> 3:52:24.040]  but I would like to advise Mr. Van Niedzen
[3:52:24.040 --> 3:52:29.040]  not to look too much into conspiracy theories.
[3:52:29.040 --> 3:52:38.040]  I also watch those fascinating YouTube videos.
[3:52:38.040 --> 3:52:40.040]  They explained how 9-11 didn't happen.
[3:52:40.040 --> 3:52:42.040]  No, we said the state worked with the Muslims.
[3:52:42.040 --> 3:52:44.040]  Or that it happened a different way.
[3:52:44.040 --> 3:52:46.040]  They are nicely put together,
[3:52:46.040 --> 3:52:54.040]  but most of the time it's just what it is a conspiracy theory.
[3:52:54.040 --> 3:52:58.040]  It surprises me that the first question I asked
[3:52:58.040 --> 3:53:02.040]  was Mr. Roet, since I have been sworn in as a Member of Parliament.
[3:53:02.040 --> 3:53:11.040]  Thank you very much, but it surprises me
[3:53:11.040 --> 3:53:17.040]  that my question was answered with a lie.
[3:53:17.040 --> 3:53:20.040]  I have a letter dated November 26, 2020
[3:53:20.040 --> 3:53:24.040]  from Mr. Roet to Mr. Klaus Slob, who he doesn't know.
[3:53:24.040 --> 3:53:35.040]  In which he thanks Mr. Slob for sending him the book.
[3:53:35.040 --> 3:53:46.040]  And he calls it a hopeful analysis for a better future.
[3:53:46.040 --> 3:53:54.040]  Mr. Roet, it's less than half a year ago,
[3:53:54.040 --> 3:54:00.040]  I do not know how long your memories remain active.
[3:54:00.040 --> 3:54:04.040]  But you can probably dig this up somewhere.
[3:54:04.040 --> 3:54:07.040]  So please answer my first question again,
[3:54:07.040 --> 3:54:11.040]  but this time with honesty.
[3:54:11.040 --> 3:54:19.040]  Well, the honest answer is that it is a letter out of pointlessness.
[3:54:19.040 --> 3:54:27.040]  Because, unfortunately, you cannot read all books that you get sent in.
[3:54:27.040 --> 3:54:30.040]  Back it up, so not pointless as I misread that.
[3:54:30.040 --> 3:54:32.040]  He said it's a answer of politeness.
[3:54:32.040 --> 3:54:36.040]  Obviously, I can't read all books.
[3:54:36.040 --> 3:54:40.040]  Oh, but you wrote it forward and you give awards to each other
[3:54:40.040 --> 3:54:41.040]  best buddies.
[3:54:41.040 --> 3:54:43.040]  Don't don't don't, Michael Jordan.
[3:54:43.040 --> 3:54:48.040]  Well, the honest answer is that it's a letter out of politeness.
[3:54:48.040 --> 3:54:49.040]  Continue.
[3:54:49.040 --> 3:54:53.040]  Because, unfortunately, you cannot read all books that you get sent in.
[3:54:53.040 --> 3:54:58.040]  So 30s, a minute before, he doesn't know who Klaus Slob is.
[3:54:58.040 --> 3:55:00.040]  He doesn't know about the book.
[3:55:00.040 --> 3:55:02.040]  He doesn't know about the letter.
[3:55:02.040 --> 3:55:04.040]  But now he knows all why he did this.
[3:55:04.040 --> 3:55:05.040]  Continue.
[3:55:05.040 --> 3:55:13.040]  But you want to send a thank you letter to those who sent a book.
[3:55:13.040 --> 3:55:21.040]  So Mr. Root, that he didn't lie to me, but he lied to Mr. Klaus Schwab.
[3:55:21.040 --> 3:55:28.040]  I have another question, Mr. Schwab, please, in his book,
[3:55:28.040 --> 3:55:30.040]  for resetting our world.
[3:55:30.040 --> 3:55:35.040]  He wants to replace our parliamentary democracy with a global
[3:55:35.040 --> 3:55:36.040]  technocracy.
[3:55:36.040 --> 3:55:41.040]  He pleads for the end of private property.
[3:55:41.040 --> 3:55:46.040]  And apparently Mr. Root is not even aware that he called this a
[3:55:46.040 --> 3:55:47.040]  high-ranking democracy.
[3:55:47.040 --> 3:55:51.040]  He wants to replace our parliamentary democracy with a global
[3:55:51.040 --> 3:55:52.040]  technology.
[3:55:52.040 --> 3:55:55.040]  He pleads for the end of private property.
[3:55:55.040 --> 3:56:00.040]  And apparently Mr. Root is not even aware that he called this a
[3:56:00.040 --> 3:56:02.040]  hopeful analysis for a better future.
[3:56:02.040 --> 3:56:15.040]  How is it possible that Mr. Root values a book that has
[3:56:15.040 --> 3:56:16.040]  neocommunist message?
[3:56:16.040 --> 3:56:24.040]  Well, he did not even read the book.
[3:56:24.040 --> 3:56:31.040]  So there you go.
[3:56:31.040 --> 3:56:35.040]  That young man is awesome.
[3:56:35.040 --> 3:56:39.040]  And just like these people, no one stands up to these scums.
[3:56:39.040 --> 3:56:42.040]  He looks like Mr. America, all cool, airy in the suit.
[3:56:42.040 --> 3:56:44.040]  I don't know who Klaus Schwab is.
[3:56:44.040 --> 3:56:47.040]  I just write books with him and hang out with him and get awards
[3:56:47.040 --> 3:56:48.040]  with him.
[3:56:48.040 --> 3:56:49.040]  I don't know anything.
[3:56:49.040 --> 3:56:50.040]  I'd screw you, man.
[3:56:50.040 --> 3:56:55.040]  I mean, okay, own your judges, own your system, run your scam,
[3:56:55.040 --> 3:56:56.040]  do it.
[3:56:56.040 --> 3:56:57.040]  We're done with you.
[3:56:57.040 --> 3:56:59.040]  We want out of this world with you.
[3:56:59.040 --> 3:57:01.040]  We don't want to be run by you.
[3:57:01.040 --> 3:57:03.040]  We don't want to be around you.
[3:57:03.040 --> 3:57:08.040]  And I've done three hours and 57 minutes of airtime today.
[3:57:08.040 --> 3:57:11.040]  And when I get my most fired up, I don't ever remember to do this,
[3:57:11.040 --> 3:57:13.040]  but we extended the sale because I don't have a new sale.
[3:57:13.040 --> 3:57:15.040]  Vitaminural fusion, 50% off.
[3:57:15.040 --> 3:57:16.040]  Actually, 50% off.
[3:57:16.040 --> 3:57:18.040]  We'll run it through Sunday.
[3:57:18.040 --> 3:57:20.040]  Infowarstore.com.
[3:57:20.040 --> 3:57:22.040]  If you don't find this, we'll be shut down soon.
[3:57:22.040 --> 3:57:23.040]  I mean, I'm not bitching.
[3:57:23.040 --> 3:57:24.040]  I'm not bad at you.
[3:57:24.040 --> 3:57:25.040]  Have me.
[3:57:25.040 --> 3:57:26.040]  I don't want to be here no more.
[3:57:26.040 --> 3:57:27.040]  I'm sick of looking at these people.
[3:57:27.040 --> 3:57:31.040]  But infowarstore.com, infowarstore.com keeps on air.
[3:57:31.040 --> 3:57:33.040]  And I really appreciate you.
[3:57:33.040 --> 3:57:37.040]  The War Room with Owen Schreuer, Darren Beatty's coming up with huge
[3:57:37.040 --> 3:57:38.040]  false flag news today.
[3:57:38.040 --> 3:57:40.040]  The War Room, infowarst.com.
[3:57:40.040 --> 3:57:49.040]  Three very important life-saving words.
[3:57:49.040 --> 3:57:53.040]  Vitamins, minerals, amino acids.
[3:57:53.040 --> 3:57:57.040]  And you find them all in vitamin, mineral, fusion.
[3:57:57.040 --> 3:58:02.040]  All the essential vitamins, all the essential minerals from really good,
[3:58:02.040 --> 3:58:08.040]  high quality, absorbable sources, and a bunch of key compounds,
[3:58:08.040 --> 3:58:12.040]  amino acids known to help get the nutrients into your tissues,
[3:58:12.040 --> 3:58:13.040]  into your cells.
[3:58:13.040 --> 3:58:16.040]  And despite the fact that the product is going to sell out in the next
[3:58:16.040 --> 3:58:21.040]  week or so, we are going to keep it on sale at 50% off for another
[3:58:21.040 --> 3:58:22.040]  seven days.
[3:58:22.040 --> 3:58:25.040]  So again, I am cutting this announcement on the afternoon of
[3:58:25.040 --> 3:58:27.040]  January 6, 2022.
[3:58:27.040 --> 3:58:29.040]  We're going to run this for a week.
[3:58:29.040 --> 3:58:32.040]  And then we are going to be selling out of this product.
[3:58:32.040 --> 3:58:35.040]  Hopefully more comes in in the next month or so because it's a best
[3:58:35.040 --> 3:58:36.040]  seller.
[3:58:36.040 --> 3:58:38.040]  I think everybody needs their immune system and their body.
[3:58:38.040 --> 3:58:43.040]  Get your vitamin, mineral, fusion now and support the InfoWare 360
[3:58:43.040 --> 3:58:45.040]  win at infowarstore.com.
[3:58:45.040 --> 3:58:49.040]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[3:58:49.040 --> 3:58:53.040]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[3:58:53.040 --> 3:58:57.040]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative
[3:58:57.040 --> 3:59:00.040]  mental condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from
[3:59:00.040 --> 3:59:02.040]  infowarstore.com.
[3:59:02.040 --> 3:59:06.040]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation
[3:59:06.040 --> 3:59:10.040]  can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride
[3:59:10.040 --> 3:59:14.040]  levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing
[3:59:14.040 --> 3:59:18.040]  reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive
[3:59:18.040 --> 3:59:19.040]  system.
[3:59:19.040 --> 3:59:24.040]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can
[3:59:24.040 --> 3:59:28.040]  stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and
[3:59:28.040 --> 3:59:30.040]  activity of immune cells.
[3:59:30.040 --> 3:59:34.040]  It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and calm
[3:59:34.040 --> 3:59:38.040]  discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[3:59:38.040 --> 3:59:42.040]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or
[3:59:42.040 --> 4:00:03.040]  yourself at infowarstore.com.
