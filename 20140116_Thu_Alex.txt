[00:00.000 --> 00:11.560]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.560 --> 00:19.120]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.120 --> 00:46.560]  Texas Alex Joe's well here we are again my friends and it is just insane what's
[00:46.560 --> 00:53.680]  going on I cannot believe that Obama is officially becoming a dictator and it is
[00:53.680 --> 00:56.960]  just being announced like they're talking about the cost of pork bellies
[00:56.960 --> 01:04.480]  or the weather in Topeka Kansas it is just being calmly discussed like you
[01:04.480 --> 01:07.920]  were tuning into local news here the high school football scores on Friday
[01:07.920 --> 01:15.760]  night I mean this is amazing this is how Liberty dies not with an uproar against
[01:15.760 --> 01:24.120]  it but with a thunderous applause as the Republican Party leadership comes out
[01:24.120 --> 01:29.040]  and basically says on the NSA you name it we're just gonna let Obama act
[01:29.040 --> 01:33.400]  unilaterally but then the Speaker of the House Boehner I saw it on his Facebook
[01:33.400 --> 01:37.480]  has an image of Boehner holding up the Constitution and it says you know we
[01:37.480 --> 01:42.080]  operate under the Constitution we have the Constitution and the next to it has
[01:42.080 --> 01:47.560]  Obama saying President Obama has his pin and his phone in fact I'm gonna grab
[01:47.560 --> 01:51.920]  that right now and retweet that we're gonna grab that image and retweet that
[01:51.920 --> 01:56.280]  at real Alex Jones and the next five minutes when I go to break I'm gonna
[01:56.280 --> 02:02.880]  tweet it myself but the issue is there is everything in that image because
[02:02.880 --> 02:08.240]  Boehner has allowed this on so many fronts and the Republican blue blood
[02:08.240 --> 02:13.720]  leadership has helped lead to this because they know Obama's gonna leave
[02:13.720 --> 02:17.560]  office probably you actually may not though I think it's in the cards they
[02:17.560 --> 02:21.000]  could set off nukes or something and blame on the Patriot movement and all
[02:21.000 --> 02:24.800]  hell's gonna break loose but I don't even think they're that crazy because I've
[02:24.800 --> 02:30.320]  I've looked at the evidence just really studied it geopolitically culturally
[02:30.320 --> 02:35.440]  across the board I don't think the leader that that reckless I mean fortune
[02:35.440 --> 02:39.640]  does favor the bold and the fortune they seek is tyranny and total dominance but
[02:39.640 --> 02:43.680]  I don't even think they're that crazy because I don't see it going well for
[02:43.680 --> 02:46.880]  them maybe they know something I don't know I'm sure they do but they're
[02:46.880 --> 02:50.600]  strongly considering it they are making preparations for it I think Obama in a
[02:50.600 --> 02:56.880]  couple years we'll leave office coming up in three years I think he will leave
[02:56.880 --> 03:02.160]  office but it won't matter because the executive in the bureaucracy will be an
[03:02.160 --> 03:08.200]  official full-blown dictatorship kind of like under Caesar the Roman Senate
[03:08.200 --> 03:13.960]  became ceremonial under Julius Caesar and he became the new king of the Roman
[03:13.960 --> 03:17.880]  Empire and then of course the long decline started from there but this
[03:17.880 --> 03:22.680]  decline is gonna go much much much faster now and I've told everybody I
[03:22.680 --> 03:26.120]  have a lot of dread I've been having dread the last few months and whenever I
[03:26.120 --> 03:29.760]  have feelings of dread really bad things happen and I'm not the only one
[03:29.760 --> 03:34.840]  feeling and everyone I talk to fills it and it is let's not exaggerate ten times
[03:34.840 --> 03:41.520]  anything I've ever felt it is so intense that I don't know what's gonna
[03:41.520 --> 03:47.400]  happen but and I'm not in fear either I'm just I'm just in preparation and and
[03:47.400 --> 03:51.800]  trying to figure out why I mean you could see it all happening I mean we
[03:51.800 --> 03:56.000]  should all be upset off what's going on but it's something much bigger and I
[03:56.000 --> 03:59.160]  don't know if it's a giant false flag or World War three or an asteroid hitting
[03:59.160 --> 04:03.560]  the earth or a global collapse in the financial markets or a bio weapon being
[04:03.560 --> 04:08.200]  released I want to open the phones today and ask you what are you feeling
[04:08.200 --> 04:12.480]  because you got to go off feelings you got to go off gut at the end of the day
[04:12.480 --> 04:19.640]  and I just have a desperate feeling of wanting to be able to figure out what's
[04:19.640 --> 04:26.560]  happening and somehow disarm this and it's a feeling of like a child trapped
[04:26.560 --> 04:29.560]  under a car and you're not strong enough to get the car off of them and they're
[04:29.560 --> 04:33.240]  screaming and yelling asking for help I mean we're all collectively on this ship
[04:33.240 --> 04:37.560]  of humanity together and the worst of the worst are running it and I guess
[04:37.560 --> 04:42.400]  that's probably the gut feeling overall is just that we're in the hands of evil
[04:42.400 --> 04:48.480]  and we wish it wasn't true but it's true and I think when I'm feeling is
[04:48.480 --> 04:52.360]  collectively everyone's starting to wake up to how much trouble we're in and so
[04:52.360 --> 04:57.760]  I'm feeling the group collectives anxiety I think we just quantified the large
[04:57.760 --> 05:04.040]  portion Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers the prognosis
[05:04.040 --> 05:08.840]  for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse the globalist

[08:25.440 --> 08:38.640]  we don't have any outside guests on the broadcast today but we're going to get
[08:38.640 --> 08:44.040]  the members of the crew that are out in California for seven days in studio for
[08:44.040 --> 08:48.960]  the last half of the third hour the last hour today to get jacari jackson's
[08:48.960 --> 08:54.840]  breakdown to get the breakdown by Don Salazar on other points in hindsight and
[08:54.840 --> 08:57.960]  some of the video reports they've shot that we've not aired yet they're going
[08:57.960 --> 09:02.080]  to be airing on the nightly news tonight and on the radio tomorrow on a host of
[09:02.080 --> 09:06.400]  issues not just the radiation issue increasing out on the west coast and
[09:06.400 --> 09:11.640]  across the country as well and then we're going to get Glen trolls and of
[09:11.640 --> 09:16.560]  course Josh Owens in here the two camera guys that are both a smart fellows in
[09:16.560 --> 09:19.920]  their own right to give us their take in fact I'm going to spend most my time
[09:19.920 --> 09:24.520]  talking to them because we haven't had them on air yet to give us their
[09:24.520 --> 09:28.040]  report on what's happening out in California with the increasing
[09:28.040 --> 09:31.760]  radiation waves coming across being reported even by the federal government
[09:31.760 --> 09:36.400]  hitting the west coast as the meltdowns continue and as they continue to dump
[09:36.400 --> 09:40.960]  saltwater out of the ocean by the hundreds of thousands of gallons a day
[09:40.960 --> 09:46.400]  on to the plutonium the uranium and the rest of it as it in just pours into the
[09:46.400 --> 09:51.640]  ocean an ongoing Chernobyl event every few months they're saying it's as big as
[09:51.640 --> 09:59.120]  Chernobyl so this is just an ongoing cancer that is just continuing to kill
[09:59.120 --> 10:04.080]  the sardines kill the tuna I can't believe that major universities we've
[10:04.080 --> 10:10.240]  covered it say 98% die off in the northern Pacific and in the areas around
[10:10.240 --> 10:15.760]  California in much of the sea life this is just incredible but I'm not going to
[10:15.760 --> 10:21.560]  cover that anymore today until the last 30 minutes of the transmission you know
[10:21.560 --> 10:25.600]  I woke up at 5 a.m. this morning I couldn't sleep and I basically sat there
[10:25.600 --> 10:30.320]  and read news till about 8 a.m. and then I got in here to the office about 30
[10:30.320 --> 10:34.520]  minutes for airtime I started reading news again and all of the incredible news
[10:34.520 --> 10:39.680]  that we're going to be covering mostly in the second hour fits into the puzzle
[10:39.680 --> 10:44.720]  really illustrating that things are getting out of control and that's what
[10:44.720 --> 10:48.160]  tyrannies are like and and tyrannies can usually control their domestic
[10:48.160 --> 10:52.320]  population but then they pick fights they can't win outside the country
[10:52.320 --> 10:56.640]  generally with other tyrannies their delusional as well that's when you get
[10:56.640 --> 11:01.400]  big wars is when you've got two delusional governments who are used to
[11:01.400 --> 11:05.600]  not being stopped and not being brought into line and who are out of control and
[11:05.600 --> 11:11.920]  who shouldn't be in power who are control freaks tyrants autocrats
[11:11.920 --> 11:17.760]  psychopaths sociopaths insane zealots there's a lot of different variants in
[11:17.760 --> 11:24.360]  history we have a scientific control freak group that has created a cosmology
[11:24.360 --> 11:30.480]  of control and a pretext for their lust for control that they call the
[11:30.480 --> 11:35.240]  technotronic technocratic scientific dictatorship in their words I mean these
[11:35.240 --> 11:39.880]  are words Zabigny Brzezinski uses these are words that Aldous Huxley uses
[11:39.880 --> 11:46.640]  Julian Huxley of the UN these are the words that all of them use and that's
[11:46.640 --> 11:51.200]  what's so frustrating is I don't even read their books anymore the last book
[11:51.200 --> 11:55.480]  I read by globalist was last year by Zabigny Brzezinski is I think fifth
[11:55.480 --> 11:59.960]  book I've read bragging about how they run everything I mean between two ages
[11:59.960 --> 12:03.800]  and some of his other books he admits that the governments run the organized
[12:03.800 --> 12:09.200]  crime that the governments run everything and the argument was well we
[12:09.200 --> 12:14.800]  better control it or it'll get out of hand the best way to control the
[12:14.800 --> 12:19.760]  opposition is to lead it well you're certainly not controlling white
[12:19.760 --> 12:25.120]  slavery you're expanding it you're certainly not controlling the drug
[12:25.120 --> 12:28.320]  trade you're expanding it you're certainly not controlling parents that
[12:28.320 --> 12:33.720]  abuse their kids you're taking innocent children to feed your mills and and
[12:33.720 --> 12:38.640]  that's always the argument up front to get good men who are warped but aren't
[12:38.640 --> 12:42.600]  overall bad to follow evil men's orders is well you know the communists do
[12:42.600 --> 12:47.200]  false flags and so do what you got to do man are we gonna do a false flag to
[12:47.200 --> 12:50.200]  stop the North Vietnamese from being able to gain the hearts and minds and
[12:50.200 --> 12:53.560]  kill hundreds of thousands or we're gonna do what it takes and blow up that
[12:53.560 --> 13:00.360]  market target some kids kill a few kids be real men and then save hundreds of
[13:00.360 --> 13:07.920]  thousands that's what Colonel Kurtz which is based on a composite of several
[13:07.920 --> 13:13.560]  true stories and that's on record couple has now talked about that it's a
[13:13.560 --> 13:23.960]  composite of several different events that happened in Vietnam and with how
[13:23.960 --> 13:29.760]  special forces and people would end up basically going rogue the military
[13:29.760 --> 13:34.560]  later say they'd gone rogue it was actually text test operations to you
[13:34.560 --> 13:38.840]  know to to fight the Vietcong with tactics even more vicious and evil and
[13:38.840 --> 13:43.640]  insane than their own and Colonel Kurtz is saying we came up you know upon a
[13:43.640 --> 13:49.880]  village that had just been vaccinated and because they'd accepted the aid and
[13:49.880 --> 13:55.000]  been vaccinated the North Vietnamese regulars chopped off over a hundred
[13:55.000 --> 13:59.400]  children's arms in a neat little pile and they didn't do this because they were
[13:59.400 --> 14:03.680]  evil men or or or or tyrants by the paraphrase Colonel Kurtz they did it
[14:03.680 --> 14:07.960]  because they were hardened cadres who love their families and did this on a
[14:07.960 --> 14:14.720]  mission to defeat us and he said if I had you know a thousand such men our
[14:14.720 --> 14:20.440]  troubles in Vietnam will be over very very quickly but of course Kurtz is
[14:20.440 --> 14:29.200]  insane and has malaria and has been doing these type of things and that's how
[14:29.200 --> 14:33.960]  they corrupted our system oh we're not gonna let the communists deal the drugs
[14:33.960 --> 14:43.040]  men we're gonna run the drugs and we're gonna control it we're not going to we're
[14:43.040 --> 14:47.720]  not going to you know let them be involved that then we can limit it and
[14:47.720 --> 14:54.720]  this is the truth must be guarded by a bodyguard of lies Winston Churchill but
[14:54.720 --> 14:58.560]  no this is the path to evil the end justifies the means do you know how
[14:58.560 --> 15:04.160]  Delta Force this got declassified 15 years ago do you know because they
[15:04.160 --> 15:06.960]  changed it after that because it was actually people that criticized and it
[15:06.960 --> 15:12.280]  came out in Congress briefly do you know how Delta Force from the Navy Seals the
[15:12.280 --> 15:16.720]  Army you name it the best the best do you know how Delta Force gets chosen they
[15:16.720 --> 15:21.640]  bring them in after all this training and after all the psychological testing
[15:21.640 --> 15:27.320]  and everything and they have them read Machiavelli's The Prince written 500 years
[15:27.320 --> 15:38.840]  ago by a Italian nobleman and in the book he explains how you end up being more
[15:38.840 --> 15:43.560]  evil than evil to protect the good and how that's how you dominate and the
[15:43.560 --> 15:48.560]  injustifies the means and they have him read The Prince they don't do this now
[15:48.560 --> 15:59.480]  because they know how to pass the test and then if they decided that no I will
[15:59.480 --> 16:04.200]  do horrible things for a greater good they go well you have graduated welcome
[16:04.200 --> 16:14.720]  to Delta Force commander and that's how this works that's how this seduction
[16:14.720 --> 16:19.000]  works ladies and gentlemen and I'll be honest with you fighting evil like I do
[16:19.000 --> 16:25.400]  every day I wanted resort to evil tactics but I will not do it because you
[16:25.400 --> 16:31.120]  cannot use the ring of Mordor towards good to use the analogy of Gandalf when
[16:31.120 --> 16:36.600]  he gets off the ring goes no no no no I would try to use this for good out of my
[16:36.600 --> 16:41.880]  heart wanting to defeat the evil but I would become evil and that's how it
[16:41.880 --> 16:46.880]  works and in my life I've gotten to the point where now I retrospectively look
[16:46.880 --> 16:52.040]  at what I've done in my own life and how evil always tries to project on to me
[16:52.040 --> 16:58.640]  that I'm bad that that I'm a wolf that that that that I'm corrupt because the
[16:58.640 --> 17:03.760]  system knows my strength is in that I'm honorable the system knows my strength
[17:03.760 --> 17:08.480]  is that I am true the system knows I'm real they got me totally surveilled and
[17:08.480 --> 17:12.880]  that's a bad example of their own people who believe there is no good left it's a
[17:12.880 --> 17:16.600]  bad example that I could have success against tyrants it's a bad example that
[17:16.600 --> 17:21.000]  I could find others who believe like I do to join together in common cause for
[17:21.000 --> 17:25.080]  human dignity that's something's got to be crushed and destroyed well I'm here
[17:25.080 --> 17:30.080]  to tell you there are good people in this world and there are a lot of them in
[17:30.080 --> 17:35.280]  fact the majority of people at heart are good they're just deceived and good
[17:35.280 --> 17:39.200]  people are always guilted by evil people I've discovered into feeling bad about
[17:39.200 --> 17:42.960]  all of our own little vices our own little problems that we're not proud of
[17:42.960 --> 17:48.520]  but we're human and God knows that as well it's the Pharisees and the accusers
[17:48.520 --> 17:54.280]  the devil's called the accuser for a reason they accuse us so that we stand
[17:54.280 --> 17:58.800]  down and feel guilty while they are consciously evil and want to learn about
[17:58.800 --> 18:02.720]  new forms of evil to deploy against people when we are consciously good and
[18:02.720 --> 18:09.440]  love God and our hearts are right and we want to be good and I'm just learning
[18:09.440 --> 18:16.280]  more and more about the enemy and how the enemy operates and the enemy is now
[18:16.280 --> 18:21.600]  showing itself because the enemy is in trouble and the enemy will gain a
[18:21.600 --> 18:29.000]  foothold on this planet for a day a day a day is just like a couple years in the
[18:29.000 --> 18:39.880]  universal time the enemy will have his day but it's already the beginning of
[18:39.880 --> 18:44.360]  the end for the New World Order and the only thing that gives me sustenance is
[18:44.360 --> 18:49.520]  what feeds my heart and my soul and that's liberty and justice and I know
[18:49.520 --> 18:54.680]  my works are like dirty rags but it doesn't matter because my heart is right
[18:54.680 --> 18:58.960]  and I have a conscience and I don't like the evil and I don't like the bad and
[18:58.960 --> 19:05.000]  more and more I cannot be around it I cannot stand looking at it intense
[19:05.000 --> 19:08.640]  conscious evil I'm not judging people that have their own problems their own

[24:34.360 --> 24:38.080]  other at a public meeting that's the most effective way to do it is go in and
[24:38.080 --> 24:42.040]  have like 15 people and then every two minutes have somebody stand up and
[24:42.040 --> 24:45.680]  interrupt them and it really shakes them up about the fact that they know cell
[24:45.680 --> 24:49.440]  phones on record when you hold them up to your head for long periods of time
[24:49.440 --> 24:53.560]  we'll give you brain cancer it's a fact it rattles the DNA creates a vibration

[24:57.720 --> 25:01.040]  of major studies showing it they put out a few fake studies saying it isn't
[25:01.040 --> 25:05.040]  we're gonna be playing that video we've also got Discovery Channel saying hey
[25:05.040 --> 25:09.080]  don't listen to conspiracy theorist there is some increased radiation but
[25:09.080 --> 25:13.520]  it's not bad for you Allah and culture you know the Japanese ought to be
[25:13.520 --> 25:19.520]  thankful we've got that clip coming up nothing against and culture folks just
[25:19.520 --> 25:22.640]  when you say the Japanese ought to be thankful radiation is good for you I
[25:22.640 --> 25:26.080]  mean you know just that's meant to get people to talk about you so I will talk
[25:26.080 --> 25:30.720]  about you that's a bunch of bull and this attitude you can drink a gallon of
[25:30.720 --> 25:34.160]  whiskey every day and not get liver failure or this attitude we can be around
[25:34.160 --> 25:38.240]  this radiation or have toxic waste out there we need to clean up our environment
[25:38.240 --> 25:43.840]  just because the left uses environmental stuff to power grab doesn't mean that we
[25:43.840 --> 25:48.080]  should then just not care about the environment I'm not preaching again
[25:48.080 --> 25:52.040]  because they only do that so that we don't actually clean up the environment
[25:52.040 --> 25:54.760]  so the globalist could continue to do whatever they want by leading the
[25:54.760 --> 25:58.920]  opposition just because they claim they're leading something doesn't mean
[25:58.920 --> 26:02.760]  that libertarians are constitutionalists or whatever you call yourself then just
[26:02.760 --> 26:09.520]  turn it over to them it's very simple enough of that here is the big issue
[26:09.520 --> 26:13.760]  and we've now reached the critical point that I've been warning everybody
[26:13.760 --> 26:19.280]  about the last six years or longer but under Obama it's been definitely
[26:19.280 --> 26:26.320]  materializing and accelerating and really fleshing itself out here's AP
[26:26.320 --> 26:34.120]  Obama to Dems I'll act with or without Congress it's like the U2 song with or
[26:34.120 --> 26:40.640]  without you yeah that's Hitler's maxim senior UK defense advisor Obama is
[26:40.640 --> 26:45.120]  clueless about what he wants to do in the world that ties into that because
[26:45.120 --> 26:49.320]  again these these autocratic regimes are real good at thinking they're in
[26:49.320 --> 26:54.200]  control lying to themselves and just dominating everybody but then it starts
[26:54.200 --> 27:01.040]  to get to the point where there are other governments out there that aren't
[27:01.040 --> 27:06.000]  going to buckle and other groups and then you end up getting giant wars you
[27:06.000 --> 27:09.840]  end up getting civil wars when you guys staged some event and claimed the
[27:09.840 --> 27:13.480]  Liberty Movement did it and then come to confiscate the guns they're already
[27:13.480 --> 27:16.840]  trying to confiscate guns by stealth listing people as mentally ill that
[27:16.840 --> 27:23.320]  aren't but the list just goes on and on and on with what's unfolding right now
[27:23.320 --> 27:28.360]  now the big issue is you're like well okay dictatorship we know that's
[27:28.360 --> 27:35.440]  happening what's what's the rest of the story as Paul Harvey good day would say
[27:35.440 --> 27:41.560]  we're failing the test Congress on a host of issues military operations to a
[27:41.560 --> 27:53.880]  great extent power plants borders now Obamacare all of it is just letting
[27:53.880 --> 28:00.040]  Obama do whatever he wants and Congress said on Monday that is the leadership of
[28:00.040 --> 28:02.920]  it the traders not the whole Congress but people in control the captain of the
[28:02.920 --> 28:07.120]  ship the leaders of the committees said we're going to let you do whatever you
[28:07.120 --> 28:12.320]  want on the NSA it's admitted to be giant and illegal we were all part of it in
[28:12.320 --> 28:16.800]  the leadership we're going to pass the buck to you and so Obama will come out
[28:16.800 --> 28:20.680]  with some rhetoric saying trust me that's the quote I'm gonna fix this we're
[28:20.680 --> 28:23.720]  gonna cut back on this and then they'll actually expand it as he does on every
[28:23.720 --> 28:28.880]  front and betray people and you've got the Republican and Democratic Party
[28:28.880 --> 28:37.280]  leadership that are working together to bamboozle the public and to act like
[28:37.280 --> 28:40.280]  they're actually reforming something when they're the ones the same
[28:40.280 --> 28:45.200]  Republican and Democratic leadership that are giving more money collectively to
[28:45.200 --> 28:49.200]  go after Tea Party candidates than they are against Republican and Democrat
[28:49.200 --> 28:54.080]  while telling Tea Party be our friends come into the blue bloods we don't want
[28:54.080 --> 28:58.920]  to fight with you be nice to us while they attack them through the government
[28:58.920 --> 29:03.360]  through the IRS with the funds through all the so-called corporate
[29:03.360 --> 29:08.840]  organizations they're all lined up all the establishment most of them

[29:33.720 --> 29:37.600]  having power let me tell you corrupt people that looking for power or
[29:37.600 --> 29:41.200]  something you would have gotten more power at this stage in the game fighting

[35:04.720 --> 35:11.320]  ignorant to really stand up against this now Obama could actually try to stay in
[35:11.320 --> 35:16.760]  office but because he himself is a puppet they'll get more gas mileage out
[35:16.760 --> 35:21.320]  of a new puppet the establishment won't let him but here's the problem when you
[35:21.320 --> 35:27.640]  create a centralized apex of power that's not distributed and it's not
[35:27.640 --> 35:35.440]  separated it can be taken over by an internal coup and I don't want a
[35:35.440 --> 35:38.960]  military coup in this country because those generally don't go well it was
[35:38.960 --> 35:41.920]  led by Patriots and they reinstated the Bill of Rights and Constitution and
[35:41.920 --> 35:46.040]  tried to dismantle the system it was honest about it and said we've had a
[35:46.040 --> 35:50.360]  false far and takeover and then they you know tried to put the Speaker of the
[35:50.360 --> 35:56.200]  House in control it still wouldn't go well because the Speaker of the House is
[35:56.200 --> 36:01.480]  controlled by the very same globalists and intimidated that's why our system
[36:01.480 --> 36:05.800]  isn't so much trouble that's why the globalists are so incredibly ignorant
[36:05.800 --> 36:13.080]  of the danger that that that they've voiced the whole world into because they
[36:13.080 --> 36:20.200]  think they're playing a 19th century coup d'etat by by bureaucracy and and by
[36:20.200 --> 36:24.880]  corporate interest but that's not what's happening they're actually destroying
[36:24.880 --> 36:32.240]  the entire infrastructure of checks and balances that has allowed a lot of wealth
[36:32.240 --> 36:37.920]  to be generated and produced and a lot of liberty to be maintained compared to
[36:37.920 --> 36:40.560]  other nations
[36:44.800 --> 36:52.920]  now there is a lot to break down there is a lot to cover here today but what I'm
[36:52.920 --> 36:59.920]  getting at is this Congress is telling Obama in almost every message they send
[36:59.920 --> 37:09.520]  him we're not going to resist you we are going to fully and totally empower you
[37:09.520 --> 37:20.280]  while only giving lip service rhetoric against you and that tells you that when
[37:20.280 --> 37:23.800]  you see Homeland Security gearing up to crush domestic ascent when you see the
[37:23.800 --> 37:27.600]  spy grids being rolled out publicly when you see all the preparations for war
[37:27.600 --> 37:30.840]  being made when you see the preparations for economic collapse and bank
[37:30.840 --> 37:35.400]  holidays and bail ins and stealing your bank accounts and nationalizing your
[37:35.400 --> 37:39.520]  private pensions and cutting social security all those preparations are
[37:39.520 --> 37:42.760]  being set up and none of that will ever make the country solvent this is a
[37:42.760 --> 37:47.120]  process we've been put into to be bankrupted and robbed towards total
[37:47.120 --> 37:52.360]  political control and centralization and domestication they want you dependent
[37:52.360 --> 37:57.920]  this is horrible slavery and bondage we're going into consciously
[37:57.920 --> 38:05.360]  premeditatedly focused and I and Ron Paul and Rand Paul and Ted Cruz and
[38:05.360 --> 38:11.720]  countless others who love liberty and they all tend to be generally
[38:11.720 --> 38:16.880]  libertarians or constitutionalist classical liberals are fighting the
[38:16.880 --> 38:21.240]  authoritarians that call themselves liberals and the authoritarians that
[38:21.240 --> 38:26.480]  call themselves mainline republicans whether it's World End Daily or Matt
[38:26.480 --> 38:33.600]  Drudge or even Glenn Beck for that matter it's it's it's good messages
[38:33.600 --> 38:41.080]  overall of what made this country great and of the fact that hey we didn't cause
[38:41.080 --> 38:47.360]  this calamity and this list of calamities and the cascade of crises
[38:47.360 --> 38:55.360]  that are coming and unfolding we didn't cause this all of us are somewhat
[38:55.360 --> 38:59.160]  guilty for not doing enough not being virtuous enough not being moral enough to
[38:59.160 --> 39:03.800]  stop it the degeneration of society but we're not consciously aiding and
[39:03.800 --> 39:08.400]  abetting this and now we know it's happening and we're going to do
[39:08.400 --> 39:12.760]  something and say something about it that's all that matters and then if you
[39:12.760 --> 39:17.560]  do say something and stand up and if you try to be Andy Griffith in your area
[39:17.560 --> 39:25.120]  and really try to help your community and not judge dread we can begin to turn
[39:25.120 --> 39:30.920]  this society around unfortunately you've grown up hearing voices that
[39:30.920 --> 39:35.480]  incessantly warn of government as nothing more than some separate sinister
[39:35.480 --> 39:40.880]  entity that's at the root of all our problems some of these same votes voices
[39:40.880 --> 39:45.400]  also do their best to gum up the works they'll warn that tyranny is always
[39:45.400 --> 39:52.280]  lurking just around the corner you should reject these voices because what
[39:52.280 --> 39:56.600]  they suggest is that our brave and creative and unique experiment in self
[39:56.600 --> 40:02.000]  rule is somehow just a sham but that's enough I mean it is a sham Obama cares
[40:02.000 --> 40:11.240]  a sham shipping the jobs overseas is a sham a scam everything now is a scam and
[40:11.240 --> 40:16.160]  good people in government have basically given up and good people in
[40:16.160 --> 40:19.880]  corporations have kind of given up and there's this laissez-faire attitude about
[40:19.880 --> 40:26.360]  evil that is going to unleash hell on earth and it does every time by the way
[40:26.360 --> 40:30.880]  but this isn't Rome this isn't Babylon this is an ancient China this is an
[40:30.880 --> 40:35.240]  ancient Mesoamerica where all they had was swords and spears to cause living
[40:35.240 --> 40:40.280]  hell now they've got nanotech bio weapons chemical weapons nuclear weapons and
[40:40.280 --> 40:45.120]  other horrible things and psychotronic and positronic and brainwashing and
[40:45.120 --> 40:50.520]  chemicals in the water and I mean it is just a bunch of psychopaths turned loose
[40:50.520 --> 40:55.520]  with our resources and our technology in compartmentalized above government
[40:55.520 --> 41:03.320]  corporate reservations playing God while they create hundreds it's like 24
[41:03.320 --> 41:08.960]  underground seed banks and over a hundred DNA and RNA banks and they're
[41:08.960 --> 41:12.200]  building giant underground bunkers and talking about how great it's going to be
[41:12.200 --> 41:21.440]  after the huge apocalypse that's coming cataclysm they're calling it that and
[41:21.440 --> 41:25.040]  all these shows and movies about how wonderful it's going to be you're soon
[41:25.040 --> 41:28.920]  all going to die and then a small elite will re-emerge and create a utopia
[41:28.920 --> 41:34.100]  moon raker moon raker Ian Fleming mi-6
[41:34.360 --> 41:39.400]  Elysium doesn't mean it's all gonna happen that way but that's what they're
[41:39.400 --> 41:44.440]  shooting for they go off to Elysium but more technically underground but they
[41:44.440 --> 41:48.640]  have the Elysium plan you did you know all that's really a real plan look it up
[41:48.640 --> 41:55.040]  the ring cities we could already have all that ladies and gentlemen but they're
[41:55.040 --> 42:04.320]  not going to let you have that 2001 space Odyssey two men go into space the
[42:04.320 --> 42:09.920]  robot the technocracy kills one of them then the transcendent man has to double
[42:09.920 --> 42:16.200]  across the machines and then be reincarnated as a god that's the
[42:16.200 --> 42:22.320]  Illuminati dream and that's what they really talk about at the highest levels
[42:22.320 --> 42:26.480]  is how it's going to get down to just a few hundred of these people that are
[42:26.480 --> 42:29.680]  still alive and have merged with machines and they're going to have some
[42:29.680 --> 42:33.880]  super battle with each other until the ultimate creature survives and becomes
[42:33.880 --> 42:37.680]  god I mean this is what Ray Kurzweil and all of them write about and it's
[42:37.680 --> 42:49.400]  crazy it is the ultimate selfishness and I want to explain to everybody out
[42:49.400 --> 42:55.160]  there they're doing it they mean to try to complete this plan and if you don't
[42:55.160 --> 43:00.840]  go research when I'm saying and find out it's true you're nuts you know it's
[43:00.840 --> 43:04.400]  halfway driven me mad knowing all this information but I finally gone in
[43:04.400 --> 43:07.800]  through and beyond and I'll go in through and beyond to the next level but
[43:07.800 --> 43:11.800]  I've come in through and beyond to the next level understanding and I am at
[43:11.800 --> 43:20.320]  quasi-peace now because the knowledge of the enemy mind and of their plan is
[43:20.320 --> 43:24.920]  unbelievable let me tell you when you really know this stuff for real there
[43:24.920 --> 43:30.840]  ain't no going back what does Neo get told by Morpheus in the matrix Morpheus
[43:30.840 --> 43:37.080]  says someone cannot be told about the matrix you need to see it for yourself
[43:37.080 --> 43:45.440]  now listen I'm not saying you're gonna like this all I'm offerings the truth you
[43:45.440 --> 43:54.160]  take the blue pill this ends you go back to Wonderland you take the red pill and
[43:54.160 --> 43:57.600]  I'm gonna take you down the real rabbit hole and show you how deep it goes and
[43:57.600 --> 44:02.040]  by the way I don't know how deep it goes I'm far from being down the rat hole
[44:02.040 --> 44:07.320]  very far but I got to go down this rat hole to come out on the other side and
[44:07.320 --> 44:12.440]  find reality and all I know is the people running the institution are the
[44:12.440 --> 44:20.400]  craziest amongst us and here I am in a country with three children and my
[44:20.400 --> 44:27.400]  family comfortable with tyranny I mean I still go to movies I still go out to
[44:27.400 --> 44:30.440]  dinner and I got to go to movies and go out to dinner I've got to have some time
[44:30.440 --> 44:33.440]  off I've got to try to get my head out of this sometimes it because it's
[44:33.440 --> 44:37.040]  unhealthy to only be focused on this because you can't always be on the
[44:37.040 --> 44:41.320]  front lines of a war and I don't blame anybody out there who's done nothing to
[44:41.320 --> 44:48.920]  fight this because it's so big you ask yourself what can you do but we're at
[44:48.920 --> 44:52.680]  that key juncture right now where they've brought the dictatorship out in the
[44:52.680 --> 45:04.640]  open they're trying to sell it like it's no big deal we have we have we have
[45:04.640 --> 45:13.120]  entered the most important time in human development and human history hold on
[45:13.120 --> 45:15.920]  one second hey I'm going to break in four minutes I'll call you back okay
[45:15.920 --> 45:28.680]  thanks it's an emergency call and call about five times now continuing we have
[45:28.680 --> 45:33.000]  a decision to make we know where we're going are we going to continue on that
[45:33.000 --> 45:37.880]  path and all we have to do is morally say no spiritually say no remove
[45:37.880 --> 45:42.120]  ourselves from the equation in our minds and our body will begin to make
[45:42.120 --> 45:46.960]  choices and our minds will continue to make choices in everyday life that will
[45:46.960 --> 45:53.520]  begin to dig us out of this so that as the enemy mass projects its attack we
[45:53.520 --> 46:00.000]  will build up to meet that attack and then we'll be able to have a soft landing
[46:00.000 --> 46:04.920]  in this decadent cycle that we're entering the the bottom of we're
[46:04.920 --> 46:12.000]  entering the beginning of the end of a cycle and if we make it through the
[46:12.000 --> 46:17.560]  cycle without blowing the earth up or killing everybody humanity has really
[46:17.560 --> 46:21.560]  got some amazing things in front of us and all that matters if you really
[46:21.560 --> 46:27.640]  think about it is not us individually what matters is the group now
[46:27.640 --> 46:31.920]  individualism is paramount and key but that doesn't mean you're an individual
[46:31.920 --> 46:36.000]  only care about yourself it means you individually honor the individual and we
[46:36.000 --> 46:40.520]  must fight this corporate globalist Borg meaning that if we individually have to
[46:40.520 --> 46:46.920]  sacrifice ourselves for the whole of individuals then we will do it and in
[46:46.920 --> 46:51.680]  that understanding in that decision
[46:55.840 --> 47:01.720]  all the answers will flow forth from that deciding which side we're on and I
[47:01.720 --> 47:05.200]  know I get on the air now every day just marvel that Obama is officially a
[47:05.200 --> 47:09.200]  dictator by every historical benchmark we've been into a depression for five
[47:09.200 --> 47:14.320]  years a selective depression by every benchmark we're in a health crisis by
[47:14.320 --> 47:17.920]  every benchmark I was seeing numbers just the other day well this morning I
[47:17.920 --> 47:21.840]  was doing research but since the guy so I have it where certain types of brain
[47:21.840 --> 47:27.880]  tumors on the side of the brain where where people use the cell phones are
[47:27.880 --> 47:32.600]  just off the chart multi thousand percentage point increases and then the
[47:32.600 --> 47:36.560]  system knew that with rats back in the 70s and studies that are published they
[47:36.560 --> 47:41.760]  deployed technologies that are so easy so convenient that we all love that
[47:41.760 --> 47:49.840]  literally kill us a soft-kill weapon and I mean that's just one example of
[47:49.840 --> 47:54.440]  thousands of the type of mindset we're dealing with with what is at the bottom
[47:54.440 --> 48:02.400]  of the rat hole death pure evil liquid hate and the animating spirit of this
[48:02.400 --> 48:08.680]  world the animating spirit of wickedness and it really does come down to a fight
[48:08.680 --> 48:14.880]  between good and evil and I've got to get to all this news the big issue is
[48:14.880 --> 48:24.480]  that Congress is ceding Obama power and is acquiescing to him on every demand on
[48:24.480 --> 48:30.800]  paper and in reality they are putting out some rhetoric that they are against it
[48:30.800 --> 48:35.200]  because of the massive backlash they want you to think that they're doing
[48:35.200 --> 48:40.800]  something about it here is an article I retweeted this up on info wars the
[48:40.800 --> 48:47.200]  Twitter for real Alex Jones and it says President Obama has his pen and his
[48:47.200 --> 48:51.920]  phone and it's an image of Obama at his desk in the Oval Office and the next to
[48:51.920 --> 48:57.520]  it is John Boehner saying we have the Constitution the problem is John Boehner
[48:57.520 --> 49:01.720]  is only doing that in symbol to make you think there's opposition John Boehner
[49:01.720 --> 49:05.800]  for whatever reason hangs out with Obama constantly plays golf with him
[49:05.800 --> 49:10.040]  they're big buddies and it's all a big sick joke to these two sycophants that
[49:10.040 --> 49:13.880]  are two narcissistic punks you can look at both of them they're not even dark
[49:13.880 --> 49:18.040]  generals they're not even demonic you know high-level warriors of the New
[49:18.040 --> 49:22.120]  World Order they are little frontmen little little preening
[49:22.120 --> 49:30.680]  metrosexual punks Obama hates America hates freedom hates the family and it's
[49:30.680 --> 49:34.440]  purely turned over to evil I don't think Boehner is completely evil but he's
[49:34.440 --> 49:41.360]  definitely a little sellout and literally you read the comments no one in
[49:41.360 --> 49:47.720]  here is going along with Boehner on his Twitter out of thousands of shares and
[49:47.720 --> 49:55.720]  comments everyone's saying what's taking so long for you to do something a point
[49:55.720 --> 49:59.040]  of special committee to investigate Benghazi already in Peteric holder for
[49:59.040 --> 50:02.280]  lying to Congress but fast and furious and prosecute those responsible for
[50:02.280 --> 50:05.840]  using IRS to arrest American citizens all the way up to and including those in
[50:05.840 --> 50:10.680]  the White House do it now stand up for America with all due respect so the
[50:10.680 --> 50:15.040]  Constitution is apparently only as good as your willingness to uphold it quite
[50:15.040 --> 50:19.120]  acting like you're going to do anything remotely close to following your oath of
[50:19.120 --> 50:24.240]  office this is comments fear nothing will happen and John Boehner is an
[50:24.240 --> 50:30.760]  enabler when you take action to stop this dictator then I will start to believe
[50:30.760 --> 50:34.960]  you when he is impeached then I might start to trust you until then it's all
[50:34.960 --> 50:38.840]  blah blah blah that's what every person I was reading I can't find one person
[50:38.840 --> 50:45.160]  buying it Boehner we see you you piece of trash we see everything you do and we're
[50:45.160 --> 50:50.280]  going to be here the entire time chronicling your crimes and letting

[01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:38.360]  folks I can feel it my gut and I know I keep saying this but it's now
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:45.920]  completely permeating me and everyone I know is having feelings of serious
[01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:50.160]  concern politically economically spiritually and then you see the news
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:54.440]  reflecting that it's not even a feeling of fear it's a feeling of we need to do
[01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:59.440]  something and take action. Obama I can't believe this it actually all happened
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:05.000]  is now a dictator that does not mean he will stay in office it means he is
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:09.800]  acting as a dictator that just means dictating he's got a pin he's got a
[01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:16.560]  phone and they're acting not on little side issues or military issues for
[01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:21.520]  particular missions which you can use a continuing authorization of force in a
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:26.160]  larger region you can kind of fudge it and get around it this is blatant power
[01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:30.800]  grabbing this is blatant across the board and this is the Republican
[01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:34.200]  leadership talking out of both sides of their mouth saying oh they don't like
[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:36.960]  what's happening but actually giving Obama the power because they're having
[01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:41.880]  their strings pulled from the same new old order spider-hold now listen I'm
[01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:45.480]  not looking for a revolution I'm not looking for a shooting war against a
[01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:50.160]  bunch of police and military they don't even know what's going on I'm not some
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:56.160]  big macho guy looking for trouble I'm telling you though the way it's looking
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:02:01.720]  there's one thing Obama can do to pull this off and that stage terror attacks
[01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:04.360]  and blaming on domestic enemies and that's what they've been preparing people
[01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:10.600]  in the TVs shows the movies the films all of it you see it kids shows cartoons
[01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:16.080]  dramas movies and they admit that the government pressures Hollywood to put
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:20.760]  these messages in where the gun owning Christian conservative is killing
[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:24.920]  children selling drugs murdering people blowing up the police department none of
[01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:29.120]  that's really happening there's one case with McVeigh and that was completely
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:35.080]  staged on record we know the names of the FBI and German intelligence agents
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:38.320]  and all of them that did it and the witnesses and the cops that saw it and
[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:44.800]  I mean everything I got cop witnesses of the HUD witnesses Jane Graham all of it
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:50.600]  I mean you could convict them in front of a court murder one we know the names
[01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:58.240]  done boom you'd have a month-long trial they'd all go to the lethal injection and
[01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:01.200]  that may happen someday if we end up taking it back and having the Nuremberg
[01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:04.920]  trials and that's the issue they've committed so many crimes now they've
[01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:10.120]  got nothing to lose they're armed they're dangerous they got nuclear weapons
[01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:14.680]  they've got the COG they got North com they got sent com and let me tell you
[01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:19.320]  sent com and the Joint Chief said no to attacking Syria openly because of a
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:23.760]  military rebellion military-wide we have good men and women in the military
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:27.800]  even though a lot of the missions are corrupt and bad and misguided they and
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:32.000]  I and I've never you know been with someone that just grovels for the
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:37.320]  military in my 18 years on air until the last five years or so when I got more
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:41.840]  sophisticated and learned more and learned that is the main group that's a
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:46.800]  lake and I figured that out because the globalists are targeting the military
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:50.840]  and saying they're the number one enemy returning veterans and others because
[01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:54.480]  they know you're the ones that have the know-how to stand up against these
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:59.160]  people if they go on an offensive purge against Americans and they know you're
[01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:03.040]  the opposition they got your names folks they got your number you're under NSA
[01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:06.840]  surveillance and you know that you're under criminal foreign bank surveillance
[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:10.200]  by the occupied government and I mean we're here we're like the French
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:16.400]  resistance folks this is it except we're not the French but you can make fun of
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:20.240]  the French all day they helped found this country the French will infiltrated
[01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:27.920]  from within by the VG that stood down and let Hitler take over and you've
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:31.280]  got constitutional lawyers across the board saying Obama is becoming a
[01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:34.840]  dictator and you've got people of courage calling it like it is like Ted
[01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:38.360]  Cruz so we can do something about it but we're gonna come back and take your
[01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:44.160]  calls at 800-25-99-231 first-time callers what do we do about Obama becoming a

[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:52.280]  and then we need to brainstorm about the solution and then also do you have the

[01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:09.040]  released by the Treasury Department's website showed if you believe any of
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:12.680]  that is probably far worse the figures are scheduled for release at 9 a.m. tomorrow

[01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:31.640]  world record of 3.82 trillion at the end of December may sustain the nation's
[01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:36.560]  appetite for U.S. debt capital inflows and intervention to limit gains in the
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:40.880]  yawn have continued and contributed to China's building up currency holdings
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:45.800]  that are the third of the global total and the globalists have a deal with the
[01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:48.840]  chai comms doesn't mean they run them they have a deal with them because
[01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:54.680]  they're an authoritarian ultra evil state to to help deindustrialize the
[01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:59.400]  West to bring in authoritarian rule here and exchange China is to be given

[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:12.640]  America Asia Europe everywhere but but the globalists don't like any nation
[01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:16.000]  getting too powerful so they build up all sides playing us off against each
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:19.520]  other it's it's it's and again that's not me saying that this is a big new
[01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:22.120]  brzezinski's written a bunch of books on it Carol quickly's written a bunch of
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:26.320]  books I've read them all literally tens of thousands of pages of these of them
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:30.360]  admitting their criminal activity and talking about how stupid the public is
[01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:36.320]  and just it's sick it's sick it's sick I want to explain that again before I go
[01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:41.760]  to your calls we don't continue to tell you exactly what's going on because I'm
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:50.560]  some wonderful clairvoyant ladies and gentlemen I was told by government and
[01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:54.000]  corporate whistleblowers because I started to get whistleblowers hand
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:59.560]  delivering me stuff over a three-year period when I would do remotes at the
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:03.520]  car show at the rodeo you name it and they'd come and say listen there's
[01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:07.560]  chips with capacitors built into cable boxes the phones they can turn them on
[01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:11.160]  even when they're off and get data they can listen to you they can encrypt the
[01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:15.480]  data they can send it back your viewing habits everything I went on air and told
[01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:20.400]  people this and I got death threats okay again I mentioned this yesterday I got
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:24.000]  government contacting the radio station to get me thrown off thank God I already
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:28.680]  started my little syndicated show out of my house at the time okay because I mean
[01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:32.200]  I was breaking stuff and had no idea how groundbreaking it was I don't want the
[01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:36.120]  credit for this the point is that broke two days ago in mainstream New York Times
[01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:41.200]  about the secret chips but they titrated the dose out and I'll go to your calls
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:44.720]  now after this point how do you get somebody to be prepared to be a snake
[01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:51.600]  handler you start taking small amounts of the poison and injecting it into
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:55.800]  yourself you don't want to drink it because some of people do that to do it
[01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:58.880]  but it doesn't sound as effective you need to have it go right into your blood
[01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:03.160]  just like a fangs did it and then you build up the poison build up the poison
[01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:06.720]  build up the poison build up the poison take more more more more more more more
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:13.120]  more more building up your tolerance tolerance but they're doing the reverse
[01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:18.680]  of that like that bank executive once told me they are just slowly and
[01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:22.360]  everything they do you see the philosophy of the deception it's very
[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:26.600]  upsetting when you see New York Times CNN MSNBC with different tactics that
[01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:30.100]  you've seen it thousands of times before and you know as a tactic an admitted
[01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:34.360]  tactic of oh a hundred thousand people suspected of terrorism or criminal
[01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:38.800]  activity they intercepted their computers in the mail well they work with
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:44.360]  the manufacturers and they put the chips in so no no no that's because this is
[01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:50.920]  breaking no no no no the Intel chips folks all the major chip makers that's
[01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:54.440]  why you hear the communist Chinese we get into all of our weapons systems it's
[01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:58.240]  because they're go following global specs that the West hold them to do that's
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:01.760]  why the Pentagon then has waivers is it's okay of our fighter jets have you
[01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:04.600]  know chips with backdoors in them because they're all being made to have
[01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:08.520]  backdoors because they're designed with backdoors their design with capacitors
[01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:14.200]  they're designed with radio receivers and transmitters I mean does that tell
[01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:21.520]  you how organized this evil is how widespread and total it's it's it's
[01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:26.560]  globally agreed on by UNESCO and these global standardization boards they have
[01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:34.200]  the very same green police in Perth that they have in Johannesburg that they
[01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:38.880]  have in San Francisco I don't care if you're in Australia South Africa or the
[01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:42.800]  United States it's the same name the same uniforms the same programs of the
[01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:46.280]  CPS say the same thing when they come to your house to take your kids it's all
[01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:53.400]  been globally formulated with a unified agenda on record it's called agenda 21
[01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:59.440]  that's one major body of it and it will revolutionize our lives into hell it's
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:04.400]  a takeover they're the revolutionaries now let's go to your calls if you just
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:09.440]  joined us we're gonna go to Zach Chris Miles TJ James and others I've asked the
[01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:13.760]  question what do we do about Obama now officially being a dictator and Congress
[01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:19.400]  doing nothing to stop him the good news is if you read Boehner's website stuff
[01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:22.360]  everybody's blowing up at him for criticizing Obama verbally while
[01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:25.680]  authorizing all this and giving him the backing I mean Obama could be in peace
[01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:30.960]  right now this is a coup by the governing class against the Republic to try to
[01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:34.640]  give it to a dictator so they can blame it all on a Caesar they all a lot of them
[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:37.880]  told Caesar go ahead and be dictator we don't want the blame we don't want to
[01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:42.280]  have to make the decisions we don't want our constituents mad at us we just
[01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:47.280]  want you you do it you you hear here and that really means the bureaucracy that
[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:50.880]  writes the bills and tells Congress what to do the special interest they're
[01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:53.800]  just saying you know what let's just not even have that let's just turn it all
[01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:59.120]  over to Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan let's just give the whole thing to to see
[01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:03.480]  you're not even going to be able now to go give money to Congress to lobby
[01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:07.080]  against bad stuff that's not gonna even matter they'll still take your money but
[01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:11.280]  it's not see it stuff's about to get real bad because as bad as lobbyist are
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:14.240]  and buying and selling Congress at least there were some good interest in
[01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:20.600]  there that could battle not anymore not anymore not when all this gets
[01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:25.000]  submitted in precedent set I mean this is like opening the door on a
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:29.120]  submarine a thousand feet under this is not good okay let's go to your calls
[01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:32.960]  let's go to Zach in Florida for military wants to give us their take on
[01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:38.280]  Obama go ahead thanks for holding no problem great show so far Alex and you
[01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:42.800]  hit the right question right on the head what do we do and I believe that the
[01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:46.920]  answer came to us last year when Rand Paul alluded to the fact that Obama was
[01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:51.440]  drunk on power and literally what we're seeing is somebody drunk or like a
[01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:55.080]  drug addict on power and what do you do in that situation if you're a loving
[01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:59.160]  family and you have somebody in that situation you have an intervention this
[01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:03.360]  person is literally in delusion the entire administration all the things
[01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:07.360]  that they've done they are in delusion like a drug addict like an alcoholic
[01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:12.800]  they need an intervention America this is an intervention and I think he hit it
[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:16.440]  right on the nose last year when he alluded to the fact that Obama was drunk
[01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:19.640]  on power that's what it's like it's like could you imagine a drug addict or an
[01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:23.080]  alcoholic with unlimited money to get whatever they need it would be a
[01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:27.360]  disaster as we're seeing unfold today it's terrible and of course Obama admits
[01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:32.000]  he's used cocaine and is a drunk and that and you know smoked cigarettes in
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.920]  public and the president shouldn't be doing that I mean he's obviously a
[01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:39.280]  hardcore substance abuser like Bill Clinton and he's obviously on drugs you
[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:43.840]  can look at him that's why he's so skinny and I agree and then you've got all
[01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:47.400]  these special interests that only care about themselves they're going to and
[01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:50.760]  they don't even have the full picture I mean we've had corruption before but we
[01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:53.920]  at least had wise men in there that didn't want to blow the planet up and
[01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:57.360]  I'm telling you historically you're right these are the times that's what the
[01:18:57.360 --> 01:19:00.800]  British Defense Minister saying where there's not even a congruent strategy
[01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:07.880]  and where they they they think they're in full power and they're not in full
[01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:11.520]  power and that's the real danger is they're in control of us that aren't
[01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:15.760]  doing anything we're all being watched all the people in power aren't being
[01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:19.360]  watched you see what I'm saying actually they are drunk on power and if you talk
[01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:23.200]  to any behavioral psychologist doing real breakthrough for an attic or an
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:27.400]  alcoholic is what it's to hit rock bottom but as a country as a nation as a
[01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:31.880]  leader of the world seemingly we can't afford rock bottom rock bottom could be
[01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:35.920]  what World War three could be what could be dictatorial power could be the
[01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:40.280]  shredding of the Constitution we as a family somebody who is a part of this
[01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:44.080]  country tax-paying citizens need to literally hold an intervention is that
[01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:47.320]  is that through filibusters is that through Ram Paul is that through voting
[01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:50.680]  with our dollars yes but it's also realizing the fact what you brought up
[01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:53.960]  in the beginning of the second hour that we have to admit it and they have to
[01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:57.200]  admit it they have a problem and it's time for us to fix it that's right that's

[01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:23.880]  sucking the children's blood quite literally and what it does is it's
[01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:29.160]  empowered through narcissist power mad control freaks Obama saying I'm really
[01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:33.560]  good at killing people I bet money he's never killed anybody with his bare
[01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:39.560]  hands I bet money he's never killed anybody with a gun I bet money that
[01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:44.600]  other than being a street thug Obama has has never experienced any real life
[01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:50.080]  being coddled by his rich Ford Foundation Carnegie Endowment family all CIA I
[01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:54.240]  mean this guy is a joke and he talks about how he's real good at killing
[01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:58.160]  people all the real people I know that have killed a bunch of people never talk
[01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:02.400]  about it and even if they did it in an honorable way have been messed up by it
[01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:06.680]  and they sure don't brag about it and they sure don't talk about it all the
[01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:11.320]  time and again this goes to what the last caller it was a great caller said
[01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:16.240]  even though they've got a cosmology and a framework of what they're doing to
[01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:20.240]  make them think they're in control they're nuts they're nuts that's what
[01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:25.440]  every a tyrannical regime finally goes completely insane and that's all I'm
[01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:30.600]  saying to the FBI and the police and everybody else I mean you supposedly
[01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:34.120]  deal with criminals all day well we what is this government what is the
[01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:39.520]  Attorney General on Benghazi the guns everything the IRS persecution above the
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:42.920]  law appointing Democratic Party operatives that meet with the president
[01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:47.880]  for seven hours in secret to run things I mean this is an open criminal takeover
[01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:54.080]  by not just criminals that want money and power really hateful criminals that
[01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:59.080]  have really bad intent the worst type I mean I cannot come up with words to
[01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:02.560]  describe how bad these people are and this is a short segment long segment
[01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:07.400]  coming up we're gonna get to everybody let's talk to Miles who's calling from
[01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:12.520]  Florida then we'll go to James TJ Kelly Chris everybody go ahead you're on the
[01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:17.840]  air hello Alex great talking you on the first time caller I'm in South Florida
[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:24.680]  I'm actually a security guard I'm extra ex-military but I want to say I want to
[01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:28.480]  talk about what we should do right now to prepare for what's happening because I
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:33.040]  believe what's going on is a war and they are coming they eventually they
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:36.640]  are going to be at your doorstep everybody should know that so you have
[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:41.240]  to prepare physically mentally for this war same thing you would do in a real
[01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:45.440]  war just train for it you know people you got to eat healthier turn their crap
[01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:49.720]  off their TVs shows don't watch them anymore they're brainwashing your
[01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:53.480]  children we're gonna have to let do our own entertainment get out throw a
[01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:57.920]  football have fun eat better like I said stop drinking this water from the tap
[01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:03.280]  that's for sure I actually seen a bus that drove by my block and it said drink
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:07.520]  the tap water with a little kid drinking out of a water fountain I couldn't
[01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:10.840]  believe it well especially if you've been in the military you know propaganda
[01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:15.960]  you see how it's targeting everyone and then it is hard to deal with well they
[01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:19.000]  add the bad type of fluoride to the water and they know it's dumbing people
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.960]  down and then they write books admitting it and then you see stuff for
[01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:26.880]  little kids telling them take it yeah and I want to pull out my camera every
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:32.360]  time sometimes I do I take pictures of it and I just no one can see it everyone
[01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:37.240]  around here has like no idea but I think we need to start coming together
[01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:42.320]  locally and finding the people that are weak fellow info warriors and just go
[01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:47.240]  ahead and unite with them and just try to get healthier and get ready for what's
[01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:50.920]  coming cuz it's definitely coming and you're one of the best voices out here
[01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:56.200]  trying to oh no brother I'm nobody brother we're all in this together I mean
[01:27:56.200 --> 01:27:59.360]  we're all somebody but individually I'm really you know nobody in the final
[01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:02.560]  equation I'm just someone who historically research things and was
[01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:06.880]  seeing the same patterns 20 years ago so try to do something about it and then
[01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:10.320]  you know learned a lot and I think the only testament for this show is that it
[01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:15.000]  shows what somebody with limited capacity like myself compared to a lot of
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:18.880]  people can do if you have the will and the spirit and that's why we have to
[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:23.680]  have heart as this evil comes in and as things get worse and worse there's a
[01:28:23.680 --> 01:28:26.360]  reason they want to shut us up there's a reason they want to get rid of free
[01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:30.640]  speech it's because when stuff gets really bad if you're out in the bright
[01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:36.400]  blue you know sky big yellow Sun happy day you light a candle on a hilltop
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:40.080]  nobody sees it and if you're in the middle of a free country everything
[01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:45.400]  going great you know your personal light doesn't stand out but when stuff gets
[01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:49.400]  dark and it's getting dark folks people that stand up and tell the truth glow
[01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:53.880]  you can see it from five miles away and so we've all got to light our candles
[01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:59.080]  now bring light to the world but also have some extra candles that and have a
[01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:03.160]  plan that as things get more and more serious we respond we speak out we get
[01:29:03.160 --> 01:29:06.080]  involved and they're not going to be able to round everybody up who speaks out
[01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:09.400]  they're going to try to stage terror attacks blame the liberty movement
[01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:12.440]  intimidate everybody to turn against a liberty movement say I'm not part of
[01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:15.640]  that you know denounce this or we're taking you in for questioning we're
[01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:19.440]  not denouncing it there's evidence you're behind it you stand to gain let's
[01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:23.920]  see let's investigate you you have a history of this and show all the
[01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:27.280]  Democratic Party operative manuals where they say they need a stage terror
[01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:30.280]  attacks to blame it on the liberty movement I mean they've said the
[01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:35.080]  financial times of London Obama won't get his agenda through without a new
[01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:38.560]  Oklahoma City or 9-11 I mean these people are obvious great call thank you

[01:34:17.400 --> 01:34:20.280]  me just add for new listeners just tuned in we're talking about Obama
[01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:23.840]  officially being a dictator Congress going along with it on everything from
[01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:29.040]  health care to open borders to military operations to shutting down our power
[01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:34.320]  plants to carbon taxes to guns he says he may just start banning high
[01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:37.880]  capacity mags with executive orders banning their importation banning their
[01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:43.200]  manufacture banning the production of lead bullets I mean they're just saying
[01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:46.920]  they're coming implementing the UN treaty I mean it's happening and if
[01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:50.040]  everybody just starts going along with it we're going to be cooked very quickly
[01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:53.920]  or it's going to move into a civil war and again that's going to be
[01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:58.760]  precipitated by a stage terror attack they had three different a couple years
[01:34:58.760 --> 01:35:02.080]  ago Democratic Party operatives we should do another report on this we played
[01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:06.640]  the clips here before and from the news and covered it saying man we sure need
[01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:10.240]  a terror attack and if there was one we could really raise a lot of money and
[01:35:10.240 --> 01:35:14.880]  take over and well you know we think there needs to be one and this was being
[01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:19.000]  sent around to billionaire donors that give millions and of course that's come
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:22.360]  out in the news Glenn Beck and others have covered it with their credit even
[01:35:22.360 --> 01:35:27.280]  back when he was on Fox News remember this out of the financial times of London
[01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:32.760]  Obama faces growing credibility crisis this was from back in 2010 July 13th
[01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:37.560]  and in it it says the bottom line here is that Americans don't believe in
[01:35:37.560 --> 01:35:41.360]  Obama's leadership said Rob Shapiro another former Clinton official and
[01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:47.080]  supporter of Obama he has to find some way between now and November of the
[01:35:47.080 --> 01:35:51.200]  demonstrating when he's a leader who can command confidence in short of a new 9
[01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:56.920]  11 and Boston bombing or a 9 11 event of Oklahoma City bombing I can't think of
[01:35:56.920 --> 01:36:00.680]  how he could do that and they also use the Trayvon Martin race baiting race
[01:36:00.680 --> 01:36:06.720]  division Balkanization divide and conquer program and I mean again folks when
[01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:09.480]  you're reading Brzezinski's books and he's the guy pretty much running things
[01:36:09.480 --> 01:36:13.920]  today he's the top dog top technocrat because he he wrote the current plan
[01:36:13.920 --> 01:36:16.960]  they've been following since the mid-70s and his has been the most effective
[01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:20.400]  they're all very similar but he they admit he's the top dog along with Henry
[01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:23.800]  Kissinger George Solz and others that are kind of fading off into the into the
[01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:29.880]  history Brzezinski's still hopping around demonically energized and sharp as a
[01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:35.880]  razor blade and they just he speaks openly about how they've got a battle
[01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:39.120]  with free thinkers and Liberty worldwide and Liberty's rising and it's going to
[01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:43.320]  be cheaper just to kill us than propagandizes those are quotes he must
[01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:47.880]  be prepared to kill them all we can no longer fund them or use propaganda to
[01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:51.400]  control them not I'm not really doing I'm no more of a Russian accent not as
[01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:56.160]  Polish accent but I mean this is the way these guys talk and you've even have
[01:36:56.160 --> 01:37:01.960]  speaking of Polish folks the last well the first big Polish president the big
[01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:06.320]  hero left low ends of you pronounce it right if I'm pronouncing it right you
[01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:10.480]  know said we're now a tyranny in America we are a tyranny folks we are the new
[01:37:10.480 --> 01:37:16.080]  Soviet Union the EU is a new Soviet Union they call themselves the new Soviet
[01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:20.520]  Union some of their literature they're not playing games all right and they're
[01:37:20.520 --> 01:37:26.200]  coming for us and if we just say no we don't buy it no and reject it we can
[01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:30.080]  beat them like we did on the gun grab last year and like we did on so many
[01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:34.160]  other issues the last eight times they tried to gut our borders and have total
[01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:38.920]  open borders now Obama just said well I'll executively legalize everybody
[01:37:38.920 --> 01:37:46.520]  they're just doing whatever they want now because they can't beat us so what
[01:37:46.520 --> 01:37:49.680]  are we gonna do about it and then do you have the same feeling of dread that
[01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:52.840]  everybody I know is having okay I'm gonna race through calls now TJ in

[01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:11.520]  but what he's doing there and stuff and everything it's like making himself a
[01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:14.760]  king in a sense we're working against dark principalities there's no doubt

[01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:29.600]  side and we know the future he went no matter what the dark principalities

[01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:53.120]  this out to people well I appreciate you you know we're doing pretty good now
[01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:57.320]  funding-wise that people continue to buy the books the films the t-shirts the
[01:38:57.320 --> 01:39:01.000]  you know the high-quality supplement products we have an informerslife.com I
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:04.840]  haven't plugged that yet today I'm glad you reminded me to plug you know some of
[01:39:04.840 --> 01:39:08.120]  the things that we fund our operation with but yeah when you learn that they're
[01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:13.600]  giving you the bad fluoride to fill your thyroid other glands instead of the good
[01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:17.560]  member of the halogen the true nation iodine and you learn the federal
[01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:22.160]  government did a good thing in 22 and mandated it in salt and then by the 60s
[01:39:22.160 --> 01:39:25.200]  had it pulled out and that's even the you know the type that isn't that good
[01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:30.800]  but it's better than nothing you know regular chemical you know type bound
[01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:36.000]  iodine is certainly better than having the other fluorines in there but yes
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:40.560]  survival shield informerslife.com thanks for plugging it briefly you're
[01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:46.480]  endorsing it I guess you got some what did it do for you? Oh it woke me up
[01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:49.800]  completely I feel like a new man I feel like I'm 20 years old I'm actually 50
[01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:54.240]  something so you know I mean sincerely I just feel energetic I feel like I'm
[01:39:54.240 --> 01:39:58.640]  wide awake to everything. Everybody that sees me now because I worked out really
[01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:01.600]  hard and and you know did the young Jebedee taking tangerine all that I
[01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:05.560]  still do that it's great that's informershealth.com but when I got on this
[01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:09.600]  iodine about four months ago and had to build up because I was taking the
[01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:13.280]  regular dose it was making me detox but after a month or so of that now I take
[01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:17.360]  more I'm not saying you should take more talk to your doctor but I take more now
[01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:21.080]  and I mean people can see it I'm not even working out as much in fact a lot
[01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:25.360]  less because I'm working so much I'm working out half as much as I was half
[01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:31.440]  as much half as much and I'm losing more weight now and it certainly has helped
[01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:34.880]  me have more clarity and of course that doctor group won't say that on air and
[01:40:34.880 --> 01:40:40.080]  others but that's really what it does the pineal and so much more is is is that
[01:40:40.080 --> 01:40:45.200]  is that real iodine and we have the real nascent iodine it just does something
[01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:51.200]  well you know what even if you buy for $29 you supported the broadcast okay but
[01:40:51.200 --> 01:40:55.440]  but I'm telling you take the iodine challenge folks take it now if you're
[01:40:55.440 --> 01:40:59.360]  really toxic get ready took me about two weeks to start feeling you know sick
[01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:04.080]  kind of headache he stomach burning a little bit and then Dr. Group had warned
[01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:07.920]  me of that after about two weeks of that it went away never came back and I am
[01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:13.280]  literally there's nothing like it and again it's hiding in plain view it's
[01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:19.080]  an absolute in element that your body must have to live and people don't have
[01:41:19.080 --> 01:41:23.160]  it and the and the soils are played out and then the regular iodine you get is
[01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:27.400]  better than nothing but it doesn't go right in to your cells like this does
[01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:33.000]  other iodine turns black on paper do a test this turns bright blue purple bright
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:37.560]  blue purple it's it's it's it's it's lighter yellow it's real iodine but I'm
[01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:41.240]  done plugging that I'm gonna go to other callers well God bless you I appreciate
[01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:45.920]  your call in fours live calm and the people are just I'm not telling people
[01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:49.640]  to call in and plug the iodine in fact people should probably stop it okay
[01:41:49.640 --> 01:41:53.120]  because it sounds too good to be true just I'm not gonna make any promises or
[01:41:53.120 --> 01:41:57.080]  claims just try it and then email me tell me what you thought I mean you can
[01:41:57.080 --> 01:42:00.240]  call if you want but I don't want to turn it into the iodine show again I was
[01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:03.840]  trying to protect myself my family I started taking this I got warned about
[01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:08.400]  how it made me feel sick within a week to a month it made me sick in two weeks it
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:11.880]  happened everything Dr. Grip said all this stuff came out of my skin I don't
[01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:15.480]  want to be gross about it I never really had oily skin I had all this you know
[01:42:15.480 --> 01:42:19.360]  whiteheads everything's poor out of me and it's just I don't know what it does
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:23.080]  I just that's all I can tell you and now my skin is just clean I mean it's just
[01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:30.680]  man I'll tell you but but again responsible use ladies and gentlemen love
[01:42:30.680 --> 01:42:34.760]  it let's go ahead and talk to James and Rhode Island James you're on the air go
[01:42:34.760 --> 01:42:39.960]  ahead good good afternoon I was just thinking that with the Obama
[01:42:39.960 --> 01:42:44.400]  administration in Congress pushing on every front they're getting away with
[01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:48.440]  trees and every day I just think that soon there will be the shot heard around
[01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:53.240]  the world up here in Rhode Island we have a Democratic candidate for governor
[01:42:53.240 --> 01:42:57.080]  who's gonna leave it up the full discretion to the cities and towns for
[01:42:57.080 --> 01:43:01.240]  assault weapons and the ban whatever they want without state approval which is
[01:43:01.240 --> 01:43:06.800]  totally totally totally illegal it is and we're gonna lose my wife and I are
[01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:09.880]  gonna lose our jobs due to it Department of Health regulation for
[01:43:09.880 --> 01:43:13.800]  healthcare providers if we all submit to a flu shot and you're talking about
[01:43:13.800 --> 01:43:20.560]  poison when do we when do we stop submitting you know I don't know when
[01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:28.520]  we quit submitting I mean we need to be you know defensive never offensive in
[01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:32.880]  physical confrontations but when police walk over and you're filming a local
[01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:36.280]  water treatment plant with a flag on your microphone you're clearly the news crew
[01:43:36.280 --> 01:43:40.760]  or a citizen or whoever it's not over gonna claim you're a terrorist anymore
[01:43:40.760 --> 01:43:45.640]  it's just we say you can't film well that's there's no law I know but we were
[01:43:45.640 --> 01:43:49.040]  ordered to do this and it's kind of like when the city of Austin police got
[01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:54.520]  ordered to not let a street crew I hired her in South by Southwest last year to
[01:43:54.520 --> 01:43:59.720]  hand out 10,000 magazines downtown and the police came up sort of giving them
[01:43:59.720 --> 01:44:05.880]  tickets they were ordered by the health department that's over signage to say
[01:44:05.880 --> 01:44:11.480]  that you can't they used a hot dog stand regulation about how you had to have
[01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:16.280]  authorization of permit to have like a hot dog stand and they they tried to
[01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:20.200]  apply that to people walking around handing out literature and then the
[01:44:20.200 --> 01:44:23.800]  police said okay you're right the statute didn't say that just keep moving
[01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:27.800]  and then we pointed out all these other bar owners are out to have people that
[01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:32.840]  aren't moving and the cops said look we listened to the show and I ended up
[01:44:32.840 --> 01:44:36.080]  getting on the phone because I wasn't there and they called me I got on the phone
[01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:38.520]  listen I like to show and everything I don't like this I've been ordered to do
[01:44:38.520 --> 01:44:42.080]  this and take it up with the police department so I flipped out drove back
[01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:47.680]  from vacation and then the police refused to give tickets at that point and
[01:44:47.680 --> 01:44:53.360]  and then the health department city zoning the department technically but
[01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:56.960]  was under health they were claiming came out and started threatening to give
[01:44:56.960 --> 01:45:00.960]  tickets and then I got on the phone with that guy as I was driving back from
[01:45:00.960 --> 01:45:05.000]  Galveston everybody saw this unfold and we ended up calling into the show and
[01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:08.080]  doing YouTube videos about it and then shooting video downtown of it and we
[01:45:08.080 --> 01:45:10.920]  caught video and photos of the cops doing this and I got on the phone the
[01:45:10.920 --> 01:45:13.960]  guys like I'm a listener I don't want to get in trouble listen I know I know what
[01:45:13.960 --> 01:45:17.400]  the bull but they're gonna you know fire me if I I gotta do this and I said
[01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:21.960]  listen you're not gonna get fired tell them no and if they try to fire you got
[01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:25.200]  a major lawsuit and he went and told them no and they backed off I mean I
[01:45:25.200 --> 01:45:30.360]  mean you've got to say no to unlawful orders folks and and you know it's the
[01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:35.480]  same thing with all of this stuff saying yes has got us into this position and
[01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:39.480]  so when they do things that are unconstitutional if a city bans guns
[01:45:39.480 --> 01:45:44.120]  like Chicago and and it violates state and federal law people should be able
[01:45:44.120 --> 01:45:51.160]  to openly carry there like Adam Kokesh did in DC that's been overthrown for
[01:45:51.160 --> 01:45:57.800]  five years he he racked a shotgun on Pennsylvania Avenue and they came and
[01:45:57.800 --> 01:46:01.560]  arrested him and threw the book at him and people can say well he's crazy he's
[01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:05.120]  bad he's like Rosa Parks sitting at the front of the bus instead of the back of
[01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:11.480]  the bus at a certain point you've got to say no go ahead James anything else we
[01:46:11.480 --> 01:46:14.800]  saw three constitutional lawyers the union reps they've all shrugged their
[01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:18.640]  shoulders and refuse our case against the Department of Health and I can't wait
[01:46:18.640 --> 01:46:23.000]  to lay on me tonight and to come in this week well thank you brother God bless
[01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.680]  you and I appreciate your support we couldn't do it without the listeners

[01:46:32.680 --> 01:46:35.880]  handed another piece of news and I told you this was coming she noticed when they
[01:46:35.880 --> 01:46:39.480]  make everything digital they make it open to hacking and then they have to
[01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:42.600]  bring in systems to mitigate it they're actually run by the government
[01:46:42.600 --> 01:46:46.240]  corporations it turns out the NSA launched Stuxnet they launched most of the
[01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:51.560]  major malware and viruses that's now been confirmed this year or last year and
[01:46:51.560 --> 01:47:01.280]  look at this this is a report here that just went up just went up minutes ago

[01:47:06.200 --> 01:47:11.440]  refrigerator to attack businesses security researchers at the proof point
[01:47:11.440 --> 01:47:15.400]  have uncovered the very first wide-scale hack that involves television sets and
[01:47:15.400 --> 01:47:19.040]  at least one refrigerator yes a refrigerator and they're able to

[01:47:56.320 --> 01:48:00.840]  dread I've been having feelings of dread ever since late last year when
[01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:07.060]  Obama tried to nuke us with his missing nukes her coward for EMP and whistle
[01:48:07.060 --> 01:48:11.360]  blown by Jim Garrell I think people need to emphasize on this and we need to
[01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:17.640]  remember when Lindsay Crane came out and said oh the Iranians may nuke us because
[01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:23.680]  they see our weakness to attack Syria well this this actually been that
[01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:30.640]  that should have been the drop of the hat well absolutely I did nuke us well

[01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:42.480]  Jordan and I should have given this to Gucci already this morning to do an
[01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:46.880]  article because he's the one that's been reporting on it this was in Fox News in
[01:48:46.880 --> 01:48:50.840]  fact why don't you guys document cam this and I'll show it on my NSA Imperial

[01:55:02.280 --> 01:55:07.600]  top general top admiral but I mean the total head of all the nukes was fired
[01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:12.600]  and it was very suspicious they told AP to keep it secret and then the
[01:55:12.600 --> 01:55:16.640]  Obama administration made stuff up this is definitely a purge now and again
[01:55:16.640 --> 01:55:21.080]  we're not being melodramatic here this is all really happening the

[01:55:43.680 --> 01:55:47.240]  launch officers either getting rid of the people that would launch the missiles
[01:55:47.240 --> 01:55:50.800]  have been implicated in a cheating scandal and have been stripped of their
[01:55:50.800 --> 01:55:54.840]  certification and three officers have been implicated in a drug probe and what
[01:55:54.840 --> 01:55:58.120]  the Air Force believes is the largest such briefs of integrity of the nuclear
[01:55:58.120 --> 01:56:02.920]  force Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said Wednesday the officers
[01:56:02.920 --> 01:56:07.080]  apparently texted to each other the answers to a monthly test on their
[01:56:07.080 --> 01:56:11.320]  knowledge about operate the missiles the number includes who would get the
[01:56:11.320 --> 01:56:17.000]  cheating as well as those who may have known about it and did not report it and
[01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:21.600]  again there's always technicalities this is not about readiness ladies and
[01:56:21.600 --> 01:56:25.800]  gentlemen they keep using little nitpicky stuff here the purge the top
[01:56:25.800 --> 01:56:29.520]  people right down at the bottom that this is going on this is a cover for a
[01:56:29.520 --> 01:56:34.040]  purge and it fits into what the military's been leaking top generals
[01:56:34.040 --> 01:56:38.560]  retired and current that there's a purge going on years ago we first told you
[01:56:38.560 --> 01:56:42.240]  about it this is a big deal
[01:56:46.080 --> 01:56:50.800]  they're purging anybody that's a Christian basically and is open about it
[01:56:50.800 --> 01:56:54.720]  they're purging anybody that is against turning in the guns that they're telling
[01:56:54.720 --> 01:56:59.040]  people of Fort Hood that the founding fathers are bad I mean this is this is
[01:56:59.040 --> 01:57:02.520]  crazy obviously we have evil people that have hijacked the government when
[01:57:02.520 --> 01:57:06.080]  they're bad-mouthing the founders I mean that's if you don't like it just get out
[01:57:06.080 --> 01:57:08.800]  of the country if you don't like every other country's had all their guns

[01:58:58.320 --> 01:59:02.200]  several years ago Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment frustrated
[01:59:02.200 --> 01:59:05.200]  with the direction this country was headed and the Charlottes willing to
[01:59:05.200 --> 01:59:09.800]  sell us out for a quick buck deciding to take action a company run by Patriots
[01:59:09.800 --> 01:59:14.440]  for Patriots was born by Patriots supply has never taken a loan or accepted

[02:00:12.600 --> 02:00:20.160]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:20.160 --> 02:00:23.640]  Alex Jones
[02:00:30.080 --> 02:00:34.720]  all right if you just joined us I threw out the question an hour ago on air
[02:00:34.720 --> 02:00:38.160]  Obama now is officially a dictator I mean all the constitutional lawyers are
[02:00:38.160 --> 02:00:41.280]  saying that doesn't mean he's dictator for life just means he's turned that
[02:00:41.280 --> 02:00:44.480]  office into a dictatorship with a little help from his globalist friends and
[02:00:44.480 --> 02:00:47.680]  the Republican leadership that won't block him but the Tea Party's been
[02:00:47.680 --> 02:00:50.920]  trying to block him so the system's demonizing them and then I went on to
[02:00:50.920 --> 02:00:53.680]  ask are you having the feeling of dread that everybody I know is having and
[02:00:53.680 --> 02:00:58.720]  just of angst and anxiety I mean I've never even though I've faced a lot of
[02:00:58.720 --> 02:01:02.200]  tyranny I've never been like this I may have it for a few days before something
[02:01:02.200 --> 02:01:05.200]  really bad happens that's how I've learned to worry about it or I'll have a
[02:01:05.200 --> 02:01:10.000]  bad feeling right before something bad happens you know growing up literally
[02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.440]  like I got a bad feeling and then you know some guy walks around a corner and
[02:01:12.440 --> 02:01:17.080]  starts a fight with me everybody's picking up on this or maybe I'm wrong
[02:01:17.080 --> 02:01:20.080]  maybe you're not picking up on it but the callers have said they are picking up
[02:01:20.080 --> 02:01:23.080]  on it Kelly though you had a question about survival shield
[02:01:23.080 --> 02:01:28.480]  nason iodine go ahead yeah my main concern is I'm probably only like maybe
[02:01:28.480 --> 02:01:36.560]  15 minutes away maybe I'm near the 405 for traffic all the time but I understand
[02:01:36.560 --> 02:01:41.000]  it's gonna be detox I understand all that but my problem is because of what's
[02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:44.920]  happening with Fukushima what's happening at our coast here I know maybe
[02:01:44.920 --> 02:01:49.280]  they're lower rated like where I am near Newport Beach Huntington Beach they're
[02:01:49.280 --> 02:01:52.920]  not as high as they are up in you know Washington and up in Monterey where you
[02:01:52.920 --> 02:01:58.160]  know a lot of the testing has been going on but my question is you know in a
[02:01:58.160 --> 02:02:05.040]  nuclear fallout when the government bought 14 million doses of potassium I
[02:02:05.040 --> 02:02:09.760]  did now should I be concerned about doing that should I be concerned about
[02:02:09.760 --> 02:02:14.320]  well ma'am I want to be completely clear we've had medical doctors on we've had
[02:02:14.320 --> 02:02:22.120]  naturopaths on we've had nutritionists on we've had chemists on we've had we've
[02:02:22.120 --> 02:02:27.280]  had people on like pharmacists been fuchs there's a compounding pharmacist and
[02:02:27.280 --> 02:02:33.160]  they say go to your physician a because of liability but be you you're gonna have
[02:02:33.160 --> 02:02:36.480]  issues that you know that a physician or your health care provider is gonna
[02:02:36.480 --> 02:02:41.920]  understand better so I cannot sit here number one I'm on a doctor number two I
[02:02:41.920 --> 02:02:48.040]  don't know your situation we sell the standard government type that the
[02:02:48.040 --> 02:02:52.760]  government's buying and it's government recommended we we sell that at info
[02:02:52.760 --> 02:02:59.920]  wars store.com and at info wars life.com and if you like a reactor blows up I'd
[02:02:59.920 --> 02:03:03.560]  probably take some of that on top of it that's for heavy radiation but this
[02:03:03.560 --> 02:03:08.160]  stuff from my experience some people's experience makes them feel sick it's
[02:03:08.160 --> 02:03:13.480]  got some toxic attributes to it long-term because it's bound and I'm not
[02:03:13.480 --> 02:03:17.120]  knocking FIRO safe that the government just bought you know 14 million
[02:03:17.120 --> 02:03:20.920]  dosages of I mean it's certainly high-powered a lot more high-powered
[02:03:20.920 --> 02:03:24.920]  than the nascent iodine and again I'm not knocking competitors it's just a
[02:03:24.920 --> 02:03:32.480]  fact regular nascent iodine is is really like Lugel's iodine and and from what
[02:03:32.480 --> 02:03:36.080]  we've done research we don't even think it's really nascent iodine I mean it
[02:03:36.080 --> 02:03:40.400]  tastes absolutely terrible I would drink it in water kids really can't drink it
[02:03:40.400 --> 02:03:45.520]  it's better than nothing I think it's better than TheraSafe you know to use on
[02:03:45.520 --> 02:03:52.760]  a regular basis so you make those decisions yourself this is the purest
[02:03:52.760 --> 02:03:58.120]  cleanest form of iodine that we could find that's truly nascent and an atomic
[02:03:58.120 --> 02:04:01.640]  level and we kept selling out of this because the little place that has the
[02:04:01.640 --> 02:04:07.120]  you know the patent and stuff on this particular process with the they couldn't
[02:04:07.120 --> 02:04:11.400]  produce enough for us until they scaled up and so we went out and tried to find
[02:04:11.400 --> 02:04:16.400]  other places to get so-called nascent iodine and we just did some testing and
[02:04:16.400 --> 02:04:20.320]  stuff and just you know didn't feel comfortable selling it to be quite
[02:04:20.320 --> 02:04:23.200]  frank with you we found a few other nascent iodine varieties out there that
[02:04:23.200 --> 02:04:26.720]  we think are good that we're trying to secure as well that aren't as good as
[02:04:26.720 --> 02:04:31.600]  this maybe better health wise I don't know I'm just selling the best thing I
[02:04:31.600 --> 02:04:36.040]  could find and that's a survival shield and m4slife.com nascent iodine
[02:04:36.040 --> 02:04:41.040]  dietary supplement and you know the fact is you don't have most of them have
[02:04:41.040 --> 02:04:44.400]  this in their body now so when you take it you're going to immediately feel it
[02:04:44.400 --> 02:04:48.360]  at least everybody else I know has and so it's a lot bigger than just the
[02:04:48.360 --> 02:04:52.680]  radiation issue this stuff goes right into your blood right into your cells
[02:04:52.680 --> 02:04:56.800]  the other iodine has to break down on the stomach will be right back stay with

[02:09:00.360 --> 02:09:03.400]  guess is good because the stations know your name your name gets out there and
[02:09:03.400 --> 02:09:07.240]  the old rating book day people need to know your name so that they could write
[02:09:07.240 --> 02:09:10.360]  it down so that you could get ratings so you get advertisers you can stay on the

[02:09:14.520 --> 02:09:18.320]  sounds like I'm an ego maniac every segment hello I'm Alex Jones hello I'm
[02:09:18.320 --> 02:09:22.480]  Alex Jones we're going out to break now but I guess it's good overall for folks

[02:09:26.640 --> 02:09:32.320]  our goal is to bring you the truth now that's something that's hard to get at
[02:09:32.320 --> 02:09:38.560]  sometimes but you've got my absolute 110% pledge that I stay up at night and I
[02:09:38.560 --> 02:09:43.560]  wake up early and I roll around in bed now I used to sleep like a dead Pharaoh
[02:09:43.560 --> 02:09:48.320]  you couldn't wake me up with jackhammers and gunshots going off now that's not
[02:09:48.320 --> 02:09:52.360]  the case because of the responsibility I've got to try to absolutely get it
[02:09:52.360 --> 02:09:57.840]  right and because of the incredible quickening that we're seeing unfold
[02:09:57.840 --> 02:10:05.840]  right now now here is some of the articles that are up on info wars.com
[02:10:05.840 --> 02:10:12.040]  that are breaking right now Washington State moves to block NSA surveillance
[02:10:12.040 --> 02:10:20.200]  that's some good news that's a big deal and this is really happening I didn't
[02:10:20.200 --> 02:10:24.920]  want to talk about this now but Mikhail Phelan was writing about it and it's
[02:10:24.920 --> 02:10:28.400]  happened so many times he's actually the source of some of these documents
[02:10:28.400 --> 02:10:32.840]  Watson gets it out before we can even get it out when one hand doesn't know
[02:10:32.840 --> 02:10:38.440]  what the other hand's doing days ago we got contacted by six state senators and
[02:10:38.440 --> 02:10:43.680]  legislators in Washington and we were working on that bigger report to talk
[02:10:43.680 --> 02:10:49.240]  about what they're up to and then Watson became aware of the fact that they
[02:10:49.240 --> 02:10:52.520]  already started talking about it so I'm not bragging I'm telling you Mikhail
[02:10:52.520 --> 02:10:58.040]  Phelan got the secret documents from a city employee in Seattle I'll leave it
[02:10:58.040 --> 02:11:03.000]  at that and then a lot of the documents were later found online the public
[02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:07.680]  portions not the restricted portions about how the police with an NSA grant
[02:11:07.680 --> 02:11:12.400]  had all these snooping hubs grabbing all your cellular data wirelessly their own
[02:11:12.400 --> 02:11:17.840]  wireless hubs so they wouldn't even have to pay the telecoms for the data because
[02:11:17.840 --> 02:11:21.640]  normally they just pay for a co-located computer that just grabs all your data
[02:11:21.640 --> 02:11:26.040]  right there that's on record now they're putting up their own systems that
[02:11:26.040 --> 02:11:31.640]  double as police high-def internet video connectivity which would be fine for
[02:11:31.640 --> 02:11:34.800]  communications and stuff but the point is they're using it to steal everybody's
[02:11:34.800 --> 02:11:38.480]  data it's a felony every time they did it two days after our story broke and
[02:11:38.480 --> 02:11:41.760]  drudge report com carried it I don't try to just plug drudge report com
[02:11:41.760 --> 02:11:44.800]  drudge report com drudge report com I mean I just got to get people credit
[02:11:44.800 --> 02:11:49.360]  because mostly stories we put out that end up actually breaking through and
[02:11:49.360 --> 02:11:54.400]  actually changing laws and in breaking major stories is because drudge is
[02:11:54.400 --> 02:11:57.920]  linking to them now drudge has linked us so much over the years and our
[02:11:57.920 --> 02:12:00.560]  listeners have supported this and we had a lot of stories that would end up
[02:12:00.560 --> 02:12:04.240]  breaking nationally without drudge but I mean I'd say it's up by a factor of 10
[02:12:04.240 --> 02:12:07.880]  fold because drudge links of so many of our stories and then they just continues
[02:12:07.880 --> 02:12:12.240]  to be proven accurate and and change history so there you go round of
[02:12:12.240 --> 02:12:16.720]  applause for Matt drudge Joe curl the whole crew over there at drudge report
[02:12:16.720 --> 02:12:20.460]  com I mean look at drudge attacking the NSA
[02:12:20.460 --> 02:12:24.080]  tyranny right now I mean it just you know the guys an absolute libertarian with
[02:12:24.080 --> 02:12:27.840]  giant wave-os because believe me just like Ted Cruz and Rand Paul and myself
[02:12:27.840 --> 02:12:33.440]  this is dangerous boys and girls I mean I get followed home I get dead threats I
[02:12:33.440 --> 02:12:37.040]  don't even tell people some of the stuff that goes on that really has caused a
[02:12:37.040 --> 02:12:40.440]  lot of problems in my family I'll just leave it at that okay and I'm not gonna
[02:12:40.440 --> 02:12:44.160]  sit there and do the enemy's job for him I'm not gonna even talk about it but
[02:12:44.160 --> 02:12:47.800]  believe me they're not happy and I know other people are getting messed with as
[02:12:47.800 --> 02:12:53.160]  well and you look at Bongino the head secret service agent on foreign details
[02:12:53.160 --> 02:12:56.840]  house getting broken into office getting broken into trash getting dug
[02:12:56.840 --> 02:13:02.400]  through threats hey how you doing Bongino how your kids doing you know and
[02:13:02.400 --> 02:13:06.800]  I mean it's just like if you haven't experienced this you don't know what
[02:13:06.800 --> 02:13:10.040]  it's like and I haven't even been told that about drudge I'll just guarantee
[02:13:10.040 --> 02:13:14.200]  you he's getting I'll bet you a million bucks because I know anybody that gets
[02:13:14.200 --> 02:13:17.600]  that prominent fight and these people that come after you you get audited as
[02:13:17.600 --> 02:13:21.000]  you just never ends people say well I better not do anything or I better not
[02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:31.000]  say anything we got into this position because people were cowards do you
[02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:37.080]  understand that a free people a free men that are men and aren't cowards and who
[02:13:37.080 --> 02:13:40.320]  instinctively stand up against thugs and bullies you're gonna have a free
[02:13:40.320 --> 02:13:44.640]  society you're gonna have a dynamic society when men start thinking being a
[02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:48.960]  man is just watching football all day last night I was hearing a guy in the
[02:13:48.960 --> 02:13:55.200]  gym talking about it bragging in front of some women on a cell phone one dad I
[02:13:55.200 --> 02:13:58.520]  can't you know I'm a lawyer's a sweet bragging for a woman you know I'm a top
[02:13:58.520 --> 02:14:03.280]  lawyer and I just yeah dad well you know I can't get married this right now or
[02:14:03.280 --> 02:14:06.440]  next year during the playoffs when you want to do it because you know the
[02:14:06.440 --> 02:14:13.960]  playoffs are them there's games I mean these men think that literally
[02:14:13.960 --> 02:14:19.280]  worshiping football is manly how about worshiping liberty and the God that
[02:14:19.280 --> 02:14:25.320]  gives us the liberty where is the spirit of the Lord there is liberty where there
[02:14:25.320 --> 02:14:29.240]  is not there is tyranny what Bible verses that you can say watch the Bible I
[02:14:29.240 --> 02:14:33.560]  want to read it hey even if it's just a book as some people say I wanted to follow
[02:14:33.560 --> 02:14:44.680]  that I've read that that makes sense that's what I want I want liberty and I
[02:14:44.680 --> 02:14:48.440]  want to be lifted up like a standard against the enemy when the enemy comes
[02:14:48.440 --> 02:14:54.600]  in like a flood the spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard against it where
[02:14:54.600 --> 02:14:57.600]  the Lord is the spirit and wherever the spirit of the Lord is there is freedom
[02:14:57.600 --> 02:15:06.720]  it's that second Corinthians 3 17 oh my goodness I mean just just just look at
[02:15:06.720 --> 02:15:11.480]  the news that's breaking on info wars.com right now Washington State
[02:15:11.480 --> 02:15:15.280]  moves to block NSA surveillance I just hit refresh and saw the Gucci already
[02:15:15.280 --> 02:15:17.560]  already written article as he came and told me earlier it was about to go up
[02:15:17.560 --> 02:15:21.600]  and that Watson had just posted one and then I was in debates last night about
[02:15:21.600 --> 02:15:24.640]  when we were gonna break this and we were gonna have the state senators on but
[02:15:24.640 --> 02:15:29.440]  they contacted us and said no we we need all the documents and we need to talk
[02:15:29.440 --> 02:15:33.600]  to you and you know we may need you to come testify and we want to know who
[02:15:33.600 --> 02:15:37.520]  your sources are but we'll give them you know protection no do not and I do not
[02:15:37.520 --> 02:15:41.600]  give them the sources we're not giving the state senator sources not that we
[02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:45.720]  don't trust them but because they're under surveillance like no one else
[02:15:45.720 --> 02:15:50.720]  state government is surveilled up one side and down the other and again we're
[02:15:50.720 --> 02:15:53.720]  not gonna let them persecute the people that hand delivered this to us I'll just
[02:15:53.720 --> 02:15:58.080]  leave it at that but you know we're breaking major leaks now every week
[02:15:58.080 --> 02:16:01.720]  ladies and gentlemen Washington State moves to block NSA bill would cut
[02:16:01.720 --> 02:16:08.160]  electricity and water the physical NSA locations gotta love it that's Matt

[02:16:13.400 --> 02:16:18.320]  confirmed it was a secret FEMA facility prison yeah I think we've had Shay on
[02:16:18.320 --> 02:16:23.680]  again our listeners ladies and gentlemen see I mean I just I'm so busy in
[02:16:23.680 --> 02:16:27.000]  battles I just have a battle and move on and don't even remember the last battle
[02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:30.800]  and that's not good because we need to show people the effectiveness of our
[02:16:30.800 --> 02:16:34.400]  fight against tyrants and the effectiveness of you praying out there
[02:16:34.400 --> 02:16:36.680]  as well
[02:16:39.960 --> 02:16:44.560]  unbelievable and then there's even bigger story new commander purge another
[02:16:44.560 --> 02:16:50.680]  34 missile launch officers terminated by Air Force and you she already has that
[02:16:50.680 --> 02:16:56.080]  up tying it all in 34 more on top of five or six top ones he'll have it in
[02:16:56.080 --> 02:16:59.080]  his article I'm going from memory and he just got a quick one up there he's
[02:16:59.080 --> 02:17:04.280]  updating it right now so get that article out to everyone you know Fox News
[02:17:04.280 --> 02:17:09.240]  again reported early this morning when I just woke up and was sitting there in
[02:17:09.240 --> 02:17:15.360]  bed since I go back to sleep and Jordan hit me with a 514 text guess he was up
[02:17:15.360 --> 02:17:19.520]  you couldn't sleep either huh and there it is so we've got our article that gives
[02:17:19.520 --> 02:17:23.480]  you the background because again the Fox ones a good article just doesn't give
[02:17:23.480 --> 02:17:29.080]  you the rest of the people being fired you know it it tells you in a vacuum not
[02:17:29.080 --> 02:17:32.480]  connecting it to the other dots of what's going on and then the missing nuclear
[02:17:32.480 --> 02:17:35.840]  weapons and by the way folks you notice they never said we were wrong they never
[02:17:35.840 --> 02:17:39.440]  counter me and said I was a liar in the media I mean if I was lying about
[02:17:39.440 --> 02:17:42.560]  sources at the base saying that they dug up nukes that weren't supposed to be
[02:17:42.560 --> 02:17:46.440]  there there was a big confrontation with the police not the saying challenge
[02:17:46.440 --> 02:17:50.480]  civilian police that run the base that they couldn't bring the nukes off they
[02:17:50.480 --> 02:17:54.040]  were the head commander had to come out and say here's the order it's from the
[02:17:54.040 --> 02:17:58.520]  president move the nukes to the east coast because there weren't supposed to be
[02:17:58.520 --> 02:18:03.600]  nukes there and you know if I was lying about that I should be arrested because
[02:18:03.600 --> 02:18:08.840]  I'm yelling fire in a theater I am putting out a fraudulent story to you
[02:18:08.840 --> 02:18:14.080]  know to do something like that well I'm not but if I was putting out a
[02:18:14.080 --> 02:18:17.280]  fraudulent story I would be doing that and I should be arrested but you notice
[02:18:17.280 --> 02:18:20.080]  I haven't been there's been nothing because it's true folks it's all true

[02:18:24.360 --> 02:18:27.800]  through it's all through it's all through it's all through and I don't know what
[02:18:27.800 --> 02:18:31.840]  it means and I don't like it and I want it to stop and I don't have all the
[02:18:31.840 --> 02:18:38.840]  answers and I can't get it all done you understand that the stupid Congress needs
[02:18:38.840 --> 02:18:42.880]  to do something right now instead of handing Obama dictatorial power while
[02:18:42.880 --> 02:18:47.160]  he's purging the entire military chairman of the joint chiefs top generals

[02:23:11.040 --> 02:23:16.040]  in fact despite rising prices at the gas pump grocery store and doctor's office
[02:23:16.040 --> 02:23:21.080]  retirees have received a mere 1.3 percent annual increase to their social
[02:23:21.080 --> 02:23:25.200]  security checks meanwhile food stamp recipients have seen their payouts
[02:23:25.200 --> 02:23:30.560]  increase over 30 percent under the Obama administration that's shocking so when

[02:24:20.040 --> 02:24:25.280]  segment they're going to come back with Josh Owens and Glenn Trolls who were
[02:24:25.280 --> 02:24:28.640]  cameraman out there but are also patriots and smart guys to give their
[02:24:28.640 --> 02:24:33.240]  take on the east coast west coast radiation investigation I'm thinking
[02:24:33.240 --> 02:24:35.420]  about an east coast radiation investigation that's why that just
[02:24:35.420 --> 02:24:39.480]  slipped out because they've picked up higher levels there in the air but Glenn
[02:24:39.480 --> 02:24:44.360]  coming up actually has his physical test and he lived out in that area of
[02:24:44.360 --> 02:24:48.480]  California until just about I guess a year ago or so and he's got his
[02:24:48.480 --> 02:24:52.800]  radiation test this is going to be interesting they got people catching
[02:24:52.800 --> 02:24:56.920]  fish out there if we put that video up yet Jacari getting it ready right now
[02:24:56.920 --> 02:25:01.200]  okay good so that'll premiere on the nightly news tonight you know radioactive
[02:25:01.200 --> 02:25:05.520]  fish caught video radioactive fish caught off coast of California we only
[02:25:05.520 --> 02:25:09.320]  got a short segment so give me your final recap I know there'll be more on the
[02:25:09.320 --> 02:25:13.040]  news tonight about the investigation of the ongoing radiation waves and we'll
[02:25:13.040 --> 02:25:16.080]  talk to the other guys then go back to calls and the other news I haven't
[02:25:16.080 --> 02:25:19.880]  covered yes Alex we went out there we went as far north as Portland
[02:25:19.880 --> 02:25:24.040]  Oregon ended and San Diego California the highest levels of radiation we
[02:25:24.040 --> 02:25:27.760]  encountered half moon Bay the place with a citizen journalist went out there
[02:25:27.760 --> 02:25:32.120]  shot the viral YouTube video we found radiation levels in excess of 10 times
[02:25:32.120 --> 02:25:35.400]  of what's considered normal for that area we also talked to some of the local
[02:25:35.400 --> 02:25:38.640]  residents out there a lady told us that one of her friends is going bald from
[02:25:38.640 --> 02:25:41.840]  swimming in the water we got other people who tell us that they're not
[02:25:41.840 --> 02:25:44.800]  gonna allow their kids to swim out there but you know at the same time Alex
[02:25:44.800 --> 02:25:48.360]  there are people who may not be aware of these things because as Don pointed out
[02:25:48.360 --> 02:25:51.640]  in his article there are no warning signs telling people of these high
[02:25:51.640 --> 02:25:55.160]  radiation levels so while we were out there shooting the show there are people
[02:25:55.160 --> 02:25:58.120]  out there walking their dogs and blissfully blissfully unaware of these
[02:25:58.120 --> 02:26:01.680]  situations so of course we told them about this and hopefully they'll make
[02:26:01.680 --> 02:26:05.440]  the right decisions to stop going to that area or at least get some signage
[02:26:05.440 --> 02:26:08.480]  out there warning people about these radios and again the only other media
[02:26:08.480 --> 02:26:11.880]  other than info wars.com to cover this was a couple newspapers and now
[02:26:11.880 --> 02:26:15.680]  Discovery Channel making jokes about conspiracy theorists worrying about it
[02:26:15.680 --> 02:26:19.600]  so mainstream media made jokes info wars.com covered it drudge link to it
[02:26:19.600 --> 02:26:22.960]  but I mean you'd think this would be bigger news you think it would and like
[02:26:22.960 --> 02:26:26.600]  you pointed out before if this was 30 years ago this would be a national news
[02:26:26.600 --> 02:26:30.160]  story but now all you hear about is baseball and popcorn all these other
[02:26:30.160 --> 02:26:33.200]  things that don't really matter you know that nobody wants to talk about these
[02:26:33.200 --> 02:26:37.240]  real issues I mean can we at least get some signage out there to warn people so
[02:26:37.240 --> 02:26:39.720]  they can make the decision for themselves if they want to go out to this
[02:26:39.720 --> 02:26:44.040]  radioactive spot well said anything else your car no that's it I'm just glad to
[02:26:44.040 --> 02:26:48.360]  thankful to all the viewers and you to send us out there all the great people
[02:26:48.360 --> 02:26:51.640]  we met out there the people we met yesterday that is so exciting that you
[02:26:51.640 --> 02:26:55.480]  said everywhere you went listeners would walk up I mean we've got huge
[02:26:55.480 --> 02:26:58.560]  listenership yeah we would be shooting the show you know setting up to shine
[02:26:58.560 --> 02:27:01.560]  some guy would come and stand by and I thought maybe he has to walk by he's
[02:27:01.560 --> 02:27:05.240]  like no I'm a listener I'm here I'm here to check out the show so no come on in
[02:27:05.240 --> 02:27:08.240]  you know it's great to meet people out there so what's it like to have folks
[02:27:08.240 --> 02:27:12.240]  you've been here a year now and people know you from California it's a little
[02:27:12.240 --> 02:27:15.640]  surreal you know people like are you to carry Jack I'm like yeah I'm you know
[02:27:15.640 --> 02:27:18.640]  standing there at the microphone and again only point that out not in some
[02:27:18.640 --> 02:27:22.160]  narcissistic way hey people know we are we're having an effect we're having
[02:27:22.160 --> 02:27:25.120]  that's what I take it as we're having an effect and you know the people we talked
[02:27:25.120 --> 02:27:29.120]  to yesterday the fishermen we talked to when we were a little farther north they
[02:27:29.120 --> 02:27:31.760]  were just thankful that we would come out there and cover these things because
[02:27:31.760 --> 02:27:34.640]  like you said Alex it's really no place else where you can get this
[02:27:34.640 --> 02:27:40.120]  information absolutely adan Salazar your take on things I was pretty interesting
[02:27:40.120 --> 02:27:44.640]  to be out there I saw just three days ago the Los Angeles Times published the
[02:27:44.640 --> 02:27:48.760]  California Health Department statement saying Fukushima nobody on the west
[02:27:48.760 --> 02:27:53.200]  coast should fear Fukushima radiation and I'm not sure how they came to that
[02:27:53.200 --> 02:27:58.540]  conclusions never fear big governments here underdog I mean they said the
[02:27:58.540 --> 02:28:02.680]  radiation pretty much pretty much they said the radioactive plume should be here
[02:28:02.680 --> 02:28:07.640]  by 2014 and I think it should only be the start but it's kind of a preemptive
[02:28:07.640 --> 02:28:12.080]  to say that nobody on the west coast should fear Fukushima radiation it's
[02:28:12.080 --> 02:28:15.760]  kind of it's kind of weird that they're already coming up with the whitewash
[02:28:15.760 --> 02:28:19.720]  story for it you know it's like it's similar to the Nazi propaganda as the
[02:28:19.720 --> 02:28:25.040]  Russians pushed them back in Barbarossa and we're invading Germany and they
[02:28:25.040 --> 02:28:28.520]  were losing every battle and they were at newsroom we're winning everything's
[02:28:28.520 --> 02:28:32.880]  great remember Baghdad Bob whenever the planes are bombing a mile behind him
[02:28:32.880 --> 02:28:40.040]  he's like we have pushed the pigs back defeated out of Iraq completely pretty
[02:28:40.040 --> 02:28:44.480]  much it was pretty much like that like we said in our last report we're going
[02:28:44.480 --> 02:28:48.160]  through California we're listening to the radio and you know and nothing about
[02:28:48.160 --> 02:28:52.120]  this radiation and sometimes you heard some reports about Kelly Thomas the man
[02:28:52.120 --> 02:28:55.200]  who was unfortunately lost his life at the hands of the police that verdict
[02:28:55.200 --> 02:28:59.040]  came out why we were out there but other than that it was just you know sports and
[02:28:59.040 --> 02:29:03.400]  crap and you know things that don't matter at all yeah it really touched my
[02:29:03.400 --> 02:29:07.960]  heart to see the the response we got from people that saw us investigating like
[02:29:07.960 --> 02:29:12.040]  they were really concerned you could tell they were scared that because you know
[02:29:12.040 --> 02:29:17.000]  there was no signs there and it definitely is above way above what the
[02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:20.480]  normal CPM should be if people were really concerned when they saw us out
[02:29:20.480 --> 02:29:23.440]  there you know with our Geiger counter people walk up to us who weren't even
[02:29:23.440 --> 02:29:26.520]  fans or listeners but hey what are you guys doing out here and we tell them you

[02:32:12.520 --> 02:32:17.600]  halogen family fluoride ladies and gentlemen Alex Jones here in 1924 the
[02:32:17.600 --> 02:32:21.920]  federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add
[02:32:21.920 --> 02:32:27.240]  iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic table and the results are on
[02:32:27.240 --> 02:32:32.560]  record reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously
[02:32:32.560 --> 02:32:38.360]  been deficient in iodine bottom line iodine is important unbound clean in a

[02:33:34.680 --> 02:33:39.280]  here don't listen to the fact that almost everywhere radiation levels are
[02:33:39.280 --> 02:33:46.960]  triple normal and in some areas 14 times take your vaccines drink fluoride GMO and
[02:33:46.960 --> 02:33:58.720]  coming up at the top of the news more on Justin Bieber yeah yeah yeah no no we now
[02:33:58.720 --> 02:34:03.000]  have underdog to now announce that everything's fine so in closing we're
[02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:06.960]  gonna bring in the other guys and show a glenza blood test or as the urine test
[02:34:06.960 --> 02:34:10.440]  it's a medical test showing higher radiation after he lived out there
[02:34:10.440 --> 02:34:14.080]  we'll find out why he got the test and more but other points that we need to
[02:34:14.080 --> 02:34:18.840]  talk about here the radioactive fish was definitely interesting thing going up
[02:34:18.840 --> 02:34:21.840]  and down the coast you know the people who were who were very receptive but
[02:34:21.840 --> 02:34:25.960]  in San Francisco they should be thankful the radiation is good yeah pretty much
[02:34:25.960 --> 02:34:29.200]  in San Francisco they were thankful they're like yeah I don't care if it's
[02:34:29.200 --> 02:34:33.120]  radioactive I don't care if the NSA is watching me or whatever else it keeps me
[02:34:33.120 --> 02:34:37.200]  safe yeah I was really disturbing to see that guy in San Francisco just totally
[02:34:37.200 --> 02:34:40.600]  take it as a joke you know everybody else we talked to was really concerned
[02:34:40.600 --> 02:34:45.560]  about the radiation the planet I come from is more radioactive we're doing
[02:34:45.560 --> 02:34:50.920]  this to make your planet more palatable for our colonization program it was
[02:34:50.920 --> 02:34:54.400]  pretty much like was a man of steel they're changing though changing the
[02:34:54.400 --> 02:34:59.960]  planet to make it more habitable in the world engine yeah yeah those guys were
[02:34:59.960 --> 02:35:02.560]  all about it I have never liked a Superman movie I thought they were
[02:35:02.560 --> 02:35:06.320]  cheesy when I was a kid this was just a guy in tights but that one was good yeah
[02:35:06.320 --> 02:35:10.240]  it's really good had a good story on it yeah I had a good message mm-hmm I talked
[02:35:10.240 --> 02:35:14.920]  a lot of top Hollywood folks and they say they know pro-human anti eugenics
[02:35:14.920 --> 02:35:18.760]  pro-liberty messages are what sells so they're having to buck the guys above
[02:35:18.760 --> 02:35:21.640]  them because the tyranny messages are no longer selling that's why you got duck
[02:35:21.640 --> 02:35:25.920]  dynasty record levels exactly yeah and the Bible and all the rest of it mm-hmm
[02:35:25.920 --> 02:35:29.360]  so see we could end up conquering Hollywood people don't get the fact that
[02:35:29.360 --> 02:35:34.800]  we could win yeah I mean freedom is really popular yeah it could be
[02:35:34.800 --> 02:35:40.440]  legalized again all right then going back to Marvin the Martian meets underdog
[02:35:40.440 --> 02:35:47.280]  a Don Salazar final comments it just really touched my heart to see that
[02:35:47.280 --> 02:35:50.640]  people were so concerned with the radiation out there you know and they
[02:35:50.640 --> 02:35:55.680]  were it felt like we were doing God's work going and helping people you know
[02:35:55.680 --> 02:36:00.680]  realize that this part of the beach is really really unsafe and they were really
[02:36:00.680 --> 02:36:04.200]  thankful that we were there and it really touched my heart it felt like well
[02:36:04.200 --> 02:36:09.040]  exactly nothing feels better than really helping people exactly exactly that's
[02:36:09.040 --> 02:36:13.000]  what it's all about they help us by promoting our products and all that
[02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:16.240]  just like the guy the other day who had that great t-shirt on they help us we
[02:36:16.240 --> 02:36:22.520]  helped them and the cycle is complete the circle is now complete when I met
[02:36:22.520 --> 02:36:27.800]  Jackani Jackson I was just the learner I have to actually get into character to
[02:36:27.800 --> 02:36:31.080]  be able to do James Earl Jones hold on hold on I'm gonna try I'm gonna do it this
[02:36:31.080 --> 02:36:36.040]  is CNN closed captioning provided by Bell Atlantic the heart of closed
[02:36:36.040 --> 02:36:39.720]  captioned communication now see if I actually do that a few times I can they
[02:36:39.720 --> 02:36:44.440]  actually hired me once in a major theater chain nationwide to do a Star Wars
[02:36:44.440 --> 02:36:47.460]  ad because they wanted to charge them too much to have their own ad for their
[02:36:47.460 --> 02:36:50.960]  theaters and I did the ad I forget the theater chain will pop my head a minute
[02:36:50.960 --> 02:36:56.940]  was like and then February 21st the Star Wars trilogy like you've never seen
[02:36:56.940 --> 02:37:01.680]  it that's pretty good anyways I'll do another one okay I'll do it you know I
[02:37:01.680 --> 02:37:04.720]  shouldn't start doing voices here's what happens psychologically I do such a
[02:37:04.720 --> 02:37:09.280]  serious show I start worrying about 34 more new commanders fired I have a huge
[02:37:09.280 --> 02:37:13.280]  anxiety attack I mean not like where I can't breathe but in my mind and then I
[02:37:13.280 --> 02:37:17.360]  start screwing around I have figured out what I do I have figured it out we're
[02:37:17.360 --> 02:37:19.960]  talking about serious subjects and that for two and a half hours of it if I
[02:37:19.960 --> 02:37:24.560]  start joking once it's over to Gary yeah that happens every now do you like me
[02:37:24.560 --> 02:37:29.120]  the joking Alex better or the one that gets angry if we can find a middle ground
[02:37:29.120 --> 02:37:35.680]  you know I'm sorry go ahead no no no I'm just gonna say about the other James

[02:42:01.160 --> 02:42:03.920]  you know Alex we went to San Francisco and I talked to that guy and he said like
[02:42:03.920 --> 02:42:07.640]  I don't want to be on camera how to educate him I said the NSA is watching
[02:42:07.640 --> 02:42:10.160]  you without your permission these cameras out here are watching you without
[02:42:10.160 --> 02:42:13.600]  your permission but I guess he was okay with that well here's the deal in his
[02:42:13.600 --> 02:42:16.680]  face here remember when the guy went out there with a boom mic of tyranny is
[02:42:16.680 --> 02:42:20.240]  sticking in people's faces then they got defensive but if you do it on the
[02:42:20.240 --> 02:42:24.000]  load and nobody cares about it that's right people think too that you can't
[02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:27.480]  film them in public only if you're filming a commercial ad or if it's a
[02:42:27.480 --> 02:42:30.480]  movie then you put up science saying a movie's being shot if you walk through
[02:42:30.480 --> 02:42:33.760]  here but if I'm collecting news that's how they shoot the news at the mall is
[02:42:33.760 --> 02:42:36.760]  a little kids and stuff you don't need authorization you're in a public place
[02:42:36.760 --> 02:42:41.360]  it's the same way they film us in public the police but when they jack into your
[02:42:41.360 --> 02:42:44.440]  house or jack into your computer or steal your cell phone data that is
[02:42:44.440 --> 02:42:48.160]  felonies every time Chicago Jackson Don Salazar thank you very much gentlemen
[02:42:48.160 --> 02:42:51.160]  thank you I know you'll have more on the news and the radioactive fish you got on

[02:43:13.160 --> 02:43:19.640]  now and we are going to bring the crew in here in a moment who were out there at
[02:43:19.640 --> 02:43:26.600]  the out there at the West Coast with the reporters the print reporter and the TV
[02:43:26.600 --> 02:43:31.760]  reporter that were just in here jacari Jackson at on Salazar but briefly I try
[02:43:31.760 --> 02:43:36.360]  to have some fun sometime on the show or I will actually have a breakdown dealing
[02:43:36.360 --> 02:43:40.640]  with all the stress but it is gallows humor we're in a deadly serious
[02:43:40.640 --> 02:43:44.520]  situation and I know you know that but we're spawning the globalist of taking
[02:43:44.520 --> 02:43:48.560]  actions the way to go and so many people I run into on the street so many people
[02:43:48.560 --> 02:43:51.640]  I get emails from some people I talk to on other radio shows when I'm a guest

[02:44:44.360 --> 02:44:48.400]  multimedia operation that is the tip of the spear by becoming prisonplanet.tv
[02:44:48.400 --> 02:44:54.560]  members today it is absolutely essential now folks know Josh Owens he went out
[02:44:54.560 --> 02:45:00.080]  to the NSA with Gucci Artie and with Weldon Henson and did a great job
[02:45:00.080 --> 02:45:02.720]  covering that that became a national news story drawing attention to what was
[02:45:02.720 --> 02:45:05.720]  happening we're just filming outside they threaten to arrest us but there's
[02:45:05.720 --> 02:45:11.400]  criminally surveilling us and then of course we have Glenn Trolls who is a
[02:45:11.400 --> 02:45:15.840]  great cinematographer and filmmaker and news guy who's come to work with us for
[02:45:15.840 --> 02:45:18.600]  the new TV studio and stuff we're launching and they were both there I
[02:45:18.600 --> 02:45:22.960]  wanted to just get their take on it but but Glenn you also brought a medical
[02:45:22.960 --> 02:45:27.440]  test you got a while back I want to before we go any further do a document
[02:45:27.440 --> 02:45:33.680]  cam over here and show people this medical test that he'll then go into for
[02:45:33.680 --> 02:45:40.160]  folks that shows the levels of radiation so the headline on this we need to do a
[02:45:40.160 --> 02:45:43.160]  story about the nightly news where you you know concisely break this down is
[02:45:43.160 --> 02:45:48.520]  info wars reporter test positive for higher levels of radiation and then we
[02:45:48.520 --> 02:45:51.840]  use the fact that you lived in California and have now gotten this
[02:45:51.840 --> 02:45:57.240]  medical test by toxic metals you're in 24 hour and you can break this down from
[02:45:57.240 --> 02:46:03.120]  doctors data ink what they found because you lived in in California and tell us
[02:46:03.120 --> 02:46:07.800]  why you got tested first off a good to have you with us thank you Alex so
[02:46:07.800 --> 02:46:12.160]  basically I had been feeling a little bit lethargic and I was a little
[02:46:12.160 --> 02:46:17.360]  concerned about about my health and so I did I did I got off gluten a while ago
[02:46:17.360 --> 02:46:20.880]  and as part of that I wanted to improve my health as much as possible so I had
[02:46:20.880 --> 02:46:26.360]  doctors data run a toxic metals test on me it's a provocation test they test my
[02:46:26.360 --> 02:46:29.760]  urine for 24 hours then they give me EDTA intervene
[02:46:29.760 --> 02:46:33.880]  interveniously and then they test me again to see what comes out and I came
[02:46:33.880 --> 02:46:39.480]  off the charts on CV cesium and lead and I really believe that's because I've
[02:46:39.480 --> 02:46:44.840]  lived out in California through that whole Daiichi nuclear meltdown and you
[02:46:44.840 --> 02:46:47.520]  told me that when you finally detox and then all this how much weight did you
[02:46:47.520 --> 02:46:54.360]  lose I lost 90 pounds unbelievable so you shed all that garbage by losing the
[02:46:54.360 --> 02:46:58.920]  weight that's what doctors have told me you run you exercise you sweat that's
[02:46:58.920 --> 02:47:03.880]  how you can get radiation in the sauna yeah and did the vitamins the iodine now
[02:47:03.880 --> 02:47:08.120]  a lot more energy I feel great my thyroid is healthy I feel very good I'm
[02:47:08.120 --> 02:47:12.800]  very happy and I'm still working on this but very concerned but this is big
[02:47:12.800 --> 02:47:16.480]  tell us where you lived out there during Fukushima's first blow-up well I lived
[02:47:16.480 --> 02:47:20.800]  on the central coast by the Diablo nuclear Canyon power plant and I'd
[02:47:20.800 --> 02:47:24.720]  traveled to Los Angeles a lot to shoot as well as San Francisco to shoot so I'd
[02:47:24.720 --> 02:47:28.560]  be all over the state staying hotels and working in beaches and all kinds of
[02:47:28.560 --> 02:47:32.440]  things sobs everywhere again give folks your levels this is breaking this you
[02:47:32.440 --> 02:47:35.600]  know I don't I haven't extrapolated this with the doctor but I just know that
[02:47:35.600 --> 02:47:40.200]  it's outside of the reference point that it should be it's definitely into the
[02:47:40.200 --> 02:47:43.480]  danger zone what did they say to you about that they said that I should do
[02:47:43.480 --> 02:47:47.880]  the chelation so it's can I see that it's a show folks a document cam again
[02:47:47.880 --> 02:47:52.360]  yep and again I want to do an official report with you in studio in there
[02:47:52.360 --> 02:47:55.800]  sometime next week to break this down because this is a big deal folks show
[02:47:55.800 --> 02:48:00.600]  show TV viewers info wars.com for slash show or prison planet on TV people
[02:48:00.600 --> 02:48:04.520]  could see this but I mean described for people that are out there basically what
[02:48:04.520 --> 02:48:09.640]  we're talking about here cesium that's what was coming off of the reactor and
[02:48:09.640 --> 02:48:13.840]  and talking to physicists if it is cesium that means it's unnatural right
[02:48:13.840 --> 02:48:17.880]  you can look at the second page to describe that therefore in two paragraphs
[02:48:17.880 --> 02:48:22.000]  oh it says right there this individual's urine cesium level is higher than
[02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:28.440]  expected reflecting exposure to CS but symptoms may not be evident and then it
[02:48:28.440 --> 02:48:32.960]  goes on to say environmental contamination of CS 137 that was Fukushima
[02:48:32.960 --> 02:48:38.200]  as a result of radioactive fallout could be a concern you have doctors in a
[02:48:38.200 --> 02:48:44.360]  report saying Fukushima shot Chicago doctor's data unbelievable you're a
[02:48:44.360 --> 02:48:49.080]  smart guy you felt like crap when you got your blood tested doesn't take much
[02:48:49.080 --> 02:48:53.200]  brains to do that I guess all right Josh Evans give me your take on the trip and
[02:48:53.200 --> 02:48:57.880]  then let's get your take Lynn overall I was pretty surprised about the levels
[02:48:57.880 --> 02:49:02.160]  that we found I beforehand I guess maybe I was being naive and I thought maybe we
[02:49:02.160 --> 02:49:05.480]  would get the same levels that were in the viral video that was shot the 124 I
[02:49:05.480 --> 02:49:09.560]  think 120 what whatever the levels were and we went out there and at surfers
[02:49:09.560 --> 02:49:14.240]  beach we got 10 times the levels of what's supposedly normal which and also
[02:49:14.240 --> 02:49:18.640]  we know what supposedly normal 30 used to be 15 so I mean and then soon like you
[02:49:18.640 --> 02:49:21.880]  said it'll be what we got was normal and then people go out there levels will get
[02:49:21.880 --> 02:49:25.440]  higher that's only 5,000 that's normal right that'll just become the new
[02:49:25.440 --> 02:49:30.400]  everybody's dying that's normal right the new normal is death but um and then
[02:49:30.400 --> 02:49:35.680]  when we took a bumper sticker the new normal is death but then we stopped at
[02:49:35.680 --> 02:49:41.480]  the the water facility and this I don't know a better way to say it this this
[02:49:41.480 --> 02:49:46.920]  punk piece of trash security guard comes up and he just like obviously he's on a
[02:49:46.920 --> 02:49:50.760]  huge power trip he has no real power and he's a security guard outside of this
[02:49:50.760 --> 02:49:54.320]  plan he comes out in this little tiny buggy to come tell us to stop filming
[02:49:54.320 --> 02:49:57.280]  and we just continued filming and then he said that we can't use the footage
[02:49:57.280 --> 02:50:01.400]  that we filmed of it because it's a federal facility even though we're on
[02:50:01.400 --> 02:50:04.240]  public property well and it's a water treatment plant it's really under
[02:50:04.240 --> 02:50:07.760]  federal infra guard infrastructure protection but that's been overthrown
[02:50:07.760 --> 02:50:11.360]  in the courts it's total fraud right and just like at the NSA they come up and
[02:50:11.360 --> 02:50:14.320]  they try and intimidate you and when you aren't intimidated then they get a
[02:50:14.320 --> 02:50:17.560]  little bit scared and then even when I was getting the audio of jacari talking
[02:50:17.560 --> 02:50:22.680]  to the actual police officer he comes up to me and he says are you guys here to
[02:50:22.680 --> 02:50:26.240]  cause a problem and I said obviously we're not we were across the street just
[02:50:26.240 --> 02:50:29.480]  filming or no no you're here to cause a problem claiming that I've done
[02:50:29.480 --> 02:50:32.960]  something you're trying to escalate this to violate my first amendment do you
[02:50:32.960 --> 02:50:36.040]  want your kids growing up in a country like this skip this network break I'm
[02:50:36.040 --> 02:50:38.880]  out of control because I've got to end this with you guys and go to the calls
[02:50:38.880 --> 02:50:41.720]  as promised and again that's why you got to financially support us folks I
[02:50:41.720 --> 02:50:45.520]  skip half the breaks I'm bankrupting the show but I can't help it here I mean
[02:50:45.520 --> 02:50:49.520]  this is too important so only network breaks though not your local breaks for
[02:50:49.520 --> 02:50:55.400]  the stations support them yeah I mean you know they always back off with me
[02:50:55.400 --> 02:50:59.480]  because I just look at them and I have moral authority and I don't I don't call
[02:50:59.480 --> 02:51:02.360]  them sir when they're trying to violate your first amendment I go man you're
[02:51:02.360 --> 02:51:06.080]  out of bounds and you know it and so if you want to act like a North Korean
[02:51:06.080 --> 02:51:08.800]  thug go ahead and do it I mean at first I'm like come on first amendment if they
[02:51:08.800 --> 02:51:13.920]  keep going I go hey you better watch it and I've been too busy to sue the Dallas
[02:51:13.920 --> 02:51:16.160]  Sheriff's Department I'm probably gonna get around to that because I said I would
[02:51:16.160 --> 02:51:19.800]  I need to but there's just bigger fish to fry with missing nukes but and I'm not
[02:51:19.800 --> 02:51:23.120]  here they go why are you bashing cops why are you bashing the first amendment
[02:51:23.120 --> 02:51:27.560]  we're not in North Korea go ahead right well yeah when he came up to me and said
[02:51:27.560 --> 02:51:31.520]  that I was like well you know no one's here trying to cause a problem and he
[02:51:31.520 --> 02:51:35.960]  said well he was pointing to car and he said well he's mouthing off and because
[02:51:35.960 --> 02:51:39.760]  he mouthing off is saying I have a right to be on sidewalk as a news agency
[02:51:39.760 --> 02:51:43.120]  right because we didn't walk across the street and bow down to them and grovel
[02:51:43.120 --> 02:51:46.640]  we were mouthing off and trying to cause an issue when all we were doing was
[02:51:46.640 --> 02:51:50.760]  filming something they come over they they make a confrontation come into the
[02:51:50.760 --> 02:51:55.400]  mic they they but they come over they start a confrontation because the guy
[02:51:55.400 --> 02:51:59.280]  has no real power at all but he's out there with his little suit and to be
[02:51:59.280 --> 02:52:02.160]  really honest and I'm not trying to be mean or anything I'm not convinced that
[02:52:02.160 --> 02:52:06.120]  he wasn't mentally retarded because he just came over his his face was just I
[02:52:06.120 --> 02:52:09.880]  mean just you see certain people and he comes over and it's just it's it's
[02:52:09.880 --> 02:52:16.280]  mind-blowing that he is living in like a total land of confusion like he thinks
[02:52:16.280 --> 02:52:20.880]  they well people are in artificial wallah land I mean you'll be filming cops
[02:52:20.880 --> 02:52:24.160]  sometimes they walk over their mouths up and go I mean in New York they go I'm
[02:52:24.160 --> 02:52:29.120]  about to beat you I'm about to I'm gonna put you in jail and it's like I can't
[02:52:29.120 --> 02:52:31.200]  believe a black person sitting at the front of the bus you're gonna get in the
[02:52:31.200 --> 02:52:34.920]  back I mean it literally comes down to mental illness and that's how it was in
[02:52:34.920 --> 02:52:37.640]  Dallas all those cops in Dallas I mean they just had that look on their face
[02:52:37.640 --> 02:52:40.000]  that it's like there's something mental you're talking about the sheriff's
[02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:44.160]  department yes yeah in Dallas yeah when during JFK no they all look like they've
[02:52:44.160 --> 02:52:47.400]  been put in a microwave oven yeah you see how the Dallas cops look different
[02:52:47.400 --> 02:52:52.560]  yeah you can literally look at someone and tell yeah they just they I mean they
[02:52:52.560 --> 02:52:56.160]  they looked at us like we were literal trash just like this other guy but I mean
[02:52:56.160 --> 02:53:00.840]  when when I'm sitting there and I'm filming and they act that way I feel bad
[02:53:00.840 --> 02:53:06.480]  for them almost I feel yeah you're a news agency reporting on radiation doing
[02:53:06.480 --> 02:53:11.040]  spot checks we're told by insiders go to the water plants that's where you'll
[02:53:11.040 --> 02:53:14.720]  find the radiation that's been in the news as well and it's like how dare you as
[02:53:14.720 --> 02:53:18.680]  a news agency come across the street and film the building oh my gosh the
[02:53:18.680 --> 02:53:21.880]  government just spies on you illegally in your private stuff and that's okay
[02:53:21.880 --> 02:53:26.480]  but how dare the people want to do a report I mean it's the worst thing on the
[02:53:26.480 --> 02:53:30.320]  world why are you causing a problem right I mean I should have just shut my
[02:53:30.320 --> 02:53:32.880]  mouth turn the camera off and walked away and then that would have been fine

[02:56:12.880 --> 02:56:15.720]  they said no it's Agent Orange holds in his heart and then my uncle when the
[02:56:15.720 --> 02:56:18.360]  doctors looked at him didn't smoke didn't drink but they looked at his organs and
[02:56:18.360 --> 02:56:21.560]  they said well a lot of this is Agent Orange he has lesions we see from
[02:56:21.560 --> 02:56:26.080]  basically heart attacks in helicopter pilots from Vietnam from Agent Orange he
[02:56:26.080 --> 02:56:29.920]  had evidence of a heart attack when he was you know in his late 20s in

[02:56:36.280 --> 02:56:39.480]  volunteers for Vietnam goes over there and they have them flying through bug
[02:56:39.480 --> 02:56:44.080]  poison that they know full well wasn't just an herbicide but was a bio excuse
[02:56:44.080 --> 02:56:48.840]  me a chemical weapon if anything else I also talked to some girls in at the
[02:56:48.840 --> 02:56:52.560]  Oregon State University and they were totally oblivious to it one girl was
[02:56:52.560 --> 02:56:55.920]  actually Japanese and lived in Monterey and when I told her all about I mean

[02:57:10.360 --> 02:57:13.520]  makes and we should just support that you know I think we should make her
[02:57:13.520 --> 02:57:17.360]  president be faithful and then make the vice president that misting you I say
[02:57:17.360 --> 02:57:22.080]  that goes you as Americans such as South Africa how about that we'll live in

[03:03:23.760 --> 03:03:29.560]  tyrannies are paranoid when I'm looking at the I'm looking at 10 20 Google
[03:03:29.560 --> 03:03:32.760]  articles about the guy that was searching for pressure cookers in the cops
[03:03:32.760 --> 03:03:37.000]  came in question them well every time you're out every time you're passing an
[03:03:37.000 --> 03:03:41.560]  internet cafe that's not your computer a FedEx a business center in a hotel doing
[03:03:41.560 --> 03:03:46.720]  an innocent query nothing illegal just the innocent query the NSA what would
[03:03:46.720 --> 03:03:49.920]  they do if they had 10,000 of those queries come on now listen I don't want
[03:03:49.920 --> 03:03:54.000]  to poo poo what you're saying this is like jamming the NSA with everybody
[03:03:54.000 --> 03:04:00.560]  saying bombs you know president you know we launch operation on the fifth
[03:04:00.560 --> 03:04:07.280]  that's they only rated that Florida house as PR to make it look like the
[03:04:07.280 --> 03:04:12.520]  family search for pressure cookers and so they went and rated I think was a
[03:04:12.520 --> 03:04:16.960]  Hispanic family's house that's done to go we are spying on you but it's for your

[03:07:15.920 --> 03:07:20.480]  unique shade grown Arabica beans we have now managed to secure the sought after

[03:08:00.920 --> 03:08:09.280]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network you know
[03:08:09.280 --> 03:08:15.880]  we've had great callers today but people really haven't told me why they think
[03:08:15.880 --> 03:08:19.920]  they're gearing up for total police state isn't the financial collapse war
[03:08:19.920 --> 03:08:24.720]  domestic takeover I mean it's all of them but what are you most concerned with
[03:08:24.720 --> 03:08:27.360]  because I really want to know what you think this is what I think about all the
[03:08:27.360 --> 03:08:32.280]  time and I'm not even here because the sense of urgency everybody's feeling it
[03:08:32.280 --> 03:08:36.640]  and I want to know what you think's going on I want to play this FCC piece in
[03:08:36.640 --> 03:08:40.240]  a minute after we take these final calls because it's so important and it's really
[03:08:40.240 --> 03:08:43.800]  based on solutions but look at the stories up on drudgereport.com right
[03:08:43.800 --> 03:08:51.120]  now NSA collects 200 million text messages per day untargeted global
[03:08:51.120 --> 03:08:55.520]  sweep remember they said just a few months ago they never do that now it's
[03:08:55.520 --> 03:08:59.320]  all out in the open they've been engineering for over a decade chips and
[03:08:59.320 --> 03:09:04.480]  all your computers they can remote access when the things off okay through
[03:09:04.480 --> 03:09:09.800]  walls with air separated computers where they're not hooked into the internet
[03:09:09.800 --> 03:09:15.420]  okay I mean it's like they've been able to act like God or something it's so
[03:09:15.420 --> 03:09:21.480]  criminal here's another one the New York City communist mayor says we need many
[03:09:21.480 --> 03:09:27.200]  more cameras yes yes always always more more more more more and then it now
[03:09:27.200 --> 03:09:30.720]  hackers and get into your refrigerator and your computer because of the wireless
[03:09:30.720 --> 03:09:35.000]  systems built into them even when they're off so there you go folks that's
[03:09:35.000 --> 03:09:40.640]  some of what's on drudgereport.com then up on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com
[03:09:40.640 --> 03:09:46.720]  speaker Boehner severely criticized on Facebook for not moving to impeach Obama
[03:09:46.720 --> 03:09:51.400]  that's a great headline but you know how about conservative backlash against
[03:09:51.400 --> 03:09:55.720]  Boehner for not impeaching Obama but but it's good that that needs to go viral
[03:09:55.720 --> 03:10:00.040]  just went up we need to tweet that out at real Alex Jones also this did just get
[03:10:00.040 --> 03:10:06.760]  tweeted out I forgot earlier viral meme Obama has his pin and his iPhone and it
[03:10:06.760 --> 03:10:11.600]  just shows we've created our own meme off of Boehner's meme where he's trying to
[03:10:11.600 --> 03:10:16.360]  act like he's fighting tyranny but he's actually enabling and protecting Obama
[03:10:16.360 --> 03:10:20.880]  and people are backlashing over the fact that he's just playing politics well
[03:10:20.880 --> 03:10:26.600]  we've created our own president Obama has his pin and his phone we have the
[03:10:26.600 --> 03:10:30.320]  Constitution and we have George Washington by the way not a Boehner
[03:10:30.320 --> 03:10:34.120]  Boehner's trying to act like a leader George Washington wouldn't compromise like
[03:10:34.120 --> 03:10:36.680]  he's done you can say what you want about George Washington when he said he
[03:10:36.680 --> 03:10:39.840]  stood for something that's what he did so that's up on prisonplanet.com and
[03:10:39.840 --> 03:10:44.360]  info wars.com you can retweet it that article on those memes at real Alex
[03:10:44.360 --> 03:10:50.160]  Jones on Twitter Jerry I hate to you know tell callers that well that's not the
[03:10:50.160 --> 03:10:54.720]  best idea and I'm not saying you're wrong but NSA has responded last year going
[03:10:54.720 --> 03:10:59.080]  hey when you guys bomb the internet with bomb this bomb that we have systems
[03:10:59.080 --> 03:11:04.400]  that know that and histories and connections that it's not an issue well
[03:11:04.400 --> 03:11:08.640]  that's another fraud they're not looking for the term bomb they pray all day for
[03:11:08.640 --> 03:11:13.520]  a real bomber so they don't have to stage it okay I mean nine times out of ten
[03:11:13.520 --> 03:11:16.800]  they're staging it and that's conservative I'd say more like 19 times out
[03:11:16.800 --> 03:11:22.240]  of 20 they're staging it or finding a mentally ill person to wind up I told
[03:11:22.240 --> 03:11:26.040]  you this forever ago it's now all public via Snowden and government admissions
[03:11:26.040 --> 03:11:32.280]  they are spying on non-fortune 500 companies to steal their data they're
[03:11:32.280 --> 03:11:35.440]  spying on American companies to shut down America while acting like they do it
[03:11:35.440 --> 03:11:40.080]  to help America they're spying on small businesses and Congress and legislators
[03:11:40.080 --> 03:11:44.120]  and preachers and people to have a database to blackmail them they're
[03:11:44.120 --> 03:11:48.040]  planting internet data on people to blackmail them I mean nobody's talking
[03:11:48.040 --> 03:11:52.640]  about that they can fake fingerprints DNA internet searches they do it all the
[03:11:52.640 --> 03:11:57.040]  time I mean their favorite thing at the Pentagon is to plant child porn that's
[03:11:57.040 --> 03:12:00.320]  come out on tens of thousands of computers every few months and then come
[03:12:00.320 --> 03:12:04.000]  in and go we found this on your computer but it's okay just do what we say and we
[03:12:04.000 --> 03:12:07.160]  won't take it to jail you're like well everybody in the department has this I
[03:12:07.160 --> 03:12:10.920]  didn't yeah right listen we're gonna let you get a national security waiver on
[03:12:10.920 --> 03:12:14.800]  this they're just maybe a favor down the road and they're compromised instead of
[03:12:14.800 --> 03:12:19.120]  going no I'm gonna fight this you planted that on my computer oh that's a
[03:12:19.120 --> 03:12:25.600]  conspiracy theory oh we don't do anything like that I mean just stop being
[03:12:25.600 --> 03:12:34.840]  naive people stop it stop it stop it now so what you do is you go online and
[03:12:34.840 --> 03:12:39.520]  you say which I don't recommend you do the callers right that I would not do
[03:12:39.520 --> 03:12:42.800]  this on your own personal computer unless you're like me and you don't care
[03:12:42.800 --> 03:12:46.760]  you know on air doing it showing people because they'll try to set you up put
[03:12:46.760 --> 03:12:49.960]  you in a database but if everybody does it that's too many people to stop them I
[03:12:49.960 --> 03:12:54.720]  wouldn't do it from your own computer but if you were walking along at a hotel
[03:12:54.720 --> 03:12:57.200]  that you're not even part of in the computers are you go to the Apple Store
[03:12:57.200 --> 03:13:01.320]  just start you know typing in whatever you want in there and as long as you're
[03:13:01.320 --> 03:13:04.920]  not calling for action you just say like the packages will be delivered at 3rd
[03:13:04.920 --> 03:13:11.760]  and Liberty tomorrow they I think they'll enjoy it or you know stuff like that
[03:13:11.760 --> 03:13:15.240]  they're gonna think that's drugs we're not getting a piece of let's set that up
[03:13:15.240 --> 03:13:18.480]  take it and sell it ourselves you know I mean you're gonna run into the real
[03:13:18.480 --> 03:13:22.440]  system there the grassroots police aren't corrupt on average but above them
[03:13:22.440 --> 03:13:26.080]  they're completely corrupt and they've got naive good guys beneath them that
[03:13:26.080 --> 03:13:29.480]  are totally ignorant about what's going on who could never admit what's going on
[03:13:29.480 --> 03:13:35.680]  right above them a la serpica is the exception and there are many exceptions
[03:13:35.680 --> 03:13:40.520]  but this is how it works I mean if you want to really get them just say you
[03:13:40.520 --> 03:13:44.000]  know at your university computer that you log into just say I can't believe it
[03:13:44.000 --> 03:13:49.160]  they achieved cold fusions a day but the professor says don't tell anyone there's
[03:13:49.160 --> 03:13:53.240]  gonna be a team of guys in black suits showing up in three hours I mean the
[03:13:53.240 --> 03:13:58.120]  just to shut it down you talk about I can't believe it you know we've come up
[03:13:58.120 --> 03:14:01.640]  with this new paperclip design that no one's gonna believe you're gonna be
[03:14:01.640 --> 03:14:06.280]  robbed maybe shot in the head that's valuable and then that's entailed out
[03:14:06.280 --> 03:14:10.880]  to the to the major aggregators okay who literally datamined our brains and
[03:14:10.880 --> 03:14:14.920]  then feed it into their artificial intelligence computers to create a
[03:14:14.920 --> 03:14:19.240]  forward projecting future predicting system that can actually control the
[03:14:19.240 --> 03:14:24.480]  future by augmented stimuli through the media complex and other social systems
[03:14:24.480 --> 03:14:29.360]  to be able to test control of the mass by understanding future movements you
[03:14:29.360 --> 03:14:34.960]  can affect future movements and this is the big secret of the NSA but it's not
[03:14:34.960 --> 03:14:39.240]  to protect you from bombs it's to stop the local police department from
[03:14:39.240 --> 03:14:44.320]  stopping your bomber on the morning of the CIA drill where you're gonna set up
[03:14:44.320 --> 03:14:50.920]  the patsies at the Boston Marathon okay there's your answer does that answer
[03:14:50.920 --> 03:14:55.880]  your point there Jerry or do you agree with that no I agree with that I was
[03:14:55.880 --> 03:15:00.760]  the same search for anything illegal but search for terms but yeah you're
[03:15:00.760 --> 03:15:05.720]  absolutely correct Alex I also want to put in a quick plug and say search chat
[03:15:05.720 --> 03:15:09.840]  about the American Spring coming up where the colonel and the general and
[03:15:09.840 --> 03:15:15.320]  the veterans are marching on Washington and chat about that build it up I mean
[03:15:15.320 --> 03:15:19.840]  everybody should be posting about that and chatting about that oh yes oh the
[03:15:19.840 --> 03:15:26.560]  generals March next week or the people March on the target next week well
[03:15:26.560 --> 03:15:30.240]  talk about the American Spring where they're actually gonna do an occupy
[03:15:30.240 --> 03:15:35.400]  Washington DC next spring and build that up well I tell you something else you
[03:15:35.400 --> 03:15:39.000]  can do is you just keep talking about you know the word is spreading of the
[03:15:39.000 --> 03:15:43.080]  occupiers in the military knows that the foreign powers have seized America
[03:15:43.080 --> 03:15:47.320]  which has actually happened and the military now knows they recognize it I
[03:15:47.320 --> 03:15:51.280]  mean let me tell you the globalist are deep crap and no amount of blowing up
[03:15:51.280 --> 03:15:55.400]  schools and blaming it on us is gonna help you murderers I mean it is we we are
[03:15:55.400 --> 03:16:00.000]  engaging them we're not Germany not knock on the Germans we're not Russia
[03:16:00.000 --> 03:16:06.160]  we're not China folks we have a history and and I'm telling you it's not gonna
[03:16:06.160 --> 03:16:09.680]  go well there's a reason they poisoned our food and water to dumb us down
[03:16:09.680 --> 03:16:12.760]  because they knew we were the number one enemy that's why they're the more the
[03:16:12.760 --> 03:16:16.400]  most done they have hit us hard folks with cultural death and they've beta
[03:16:16.400 --> 03:16:20.040]  tested it here now they're exporting and everywhere else we're under a modern
[03:16:20.040 --> 03:16:23.600]  mind control system but knowing is is the answer to countering these people
[03:16:23.600 --> 03:16:27.440]  we're gonna skip this break and go to the bottom of the hour live here let's
[03:16:27.440 --> 03:16:32.880]  talk to Catherine in New York thanks for holding you're on the air Alex hi how
[03:16:32.880 --> 03:16:41.480]  are you I salute everything that you do the answer to 1984 is 1776 that's right
[03:16:41.480 --> 03:16:50.120]  God bless you okay there is a war against natural law and physics the case
[03:16:50.120 --> 03:16:54.440]  with Kelly Thomas yesterday and what you were just describing with Takari
[03:16:54.440 --> 03:17:00.720]  Jackson dealing with the officer they they are above the laws of physics the
[03:17:00.720 --> 03:17:06.160]  powers that be they are literally trying to override reality and the laws of
[03:17:06.160 --> 03:17:11.840]  physics and create situations where if you're just giving them honest feedback
[03:17:11.840 --> 03:17:19.280]  by the crazy debt based situations that they create they can make a criminal out
[03:17:19.280 --> 03:17:24.440]  of you I mean that's what that's what they're literally doing no that's like
[03:17:24.440 --> 03:17:27.600]  when the cops walk over and you're filming a demonstration or you're
[03:17:27.600 --> 03:17:31.440]  filming a wastewater plant on floor right or whatever and they walk over go
[03:17:31.440 --> 03:17:35.520]  why you're causing problems and it's a total game and you're like I'm not
[03:17:35.520 --> 03:17:38.800]  causing problems you just tried to control reality by stating that I'm
[03:17:38.800 --> 03:17:42.680]  causing a problem peacefully exercising my first amendment it's you that's
[03:17:42.680 --> 03:17:46.400]  trying to violate our sacred rights that have been fought for and dearly paid
[03:17:46.400 --> 03:17:51.360]  for and so many people stood the course and went through living hell so that we
[03:17:51.360 --> 03:17:55.760]  would have these basic freedoms so how about you fight the good fight and I'm
[03:17:55.760 --> 03:18:00.040]  telling you most cops go yeah I know I've been told to do this will you just
[03:18:00.040 --> 03:18:03.280]  do me a favor and I'll say look I don't want to argue with you and I don't want
[03:18:03.280 --> 03:18:06.360]  to get in the way of what you're doing but you know this is wrong so you're
[03:18:06.360 --> 03:18:09.720]  gonna have to arrest me if that's what you want to do I'm not challenging you
[03:18:09.720 --> 03:18:13.880]  this is not a pissing contest that's what I tell cops on video I do you want
[03:18:13.880 --> 03:18:17.480]  your kids growing up in the country like this and they'll always go no I don't
[03:18:17.480 --> 03:18:21.720]  and just walk off because most cops are not bad I mean it's like you're telling
[03:18:21.720 --> 03:18:27.080]  me I can't in a sports jacket with a flagged Mike sitter on a sidewalk from
[03:18:27.080 --> 03:18:32.520]  200 yards away and film a power plant no no I mean it's one thing one time I
[03:18:32.520 --> 03:18:37.240]  got out and filmed a chemical plant coming back from Corpus Christi with my
[03:18:37.240 --> 03:18:41.400]  family fishing because I wanted a cutaway for the news we'd have a shot of
[03:18:41.400 --> 03:18:45.960]  of when the power plant was a oil refinery and man state police cars
[03:18:45.960 --> 03:18:50.080]  shot out from about a quarter mile away down this road I saw it coming I said
[03:18:50.080 --> 03:18:53.400]  that's coming for me and just see why I'm filming this as if terrorists wouldn't
[03:18:53.400 --> 03:18:56.440]  look at Google Earth or drive by with a hidden camera it's just ridiculous but
[03:18:56.440 --> 03:19:01.000]  the point is shoots up behind me gets my plate to run it through their suspicious
[03:19:01.000 --> 03:19:04.680]  activity database but goes by me okay you want to put me in your fake database
[03:19:04.680 --> 03:19:08.600]  and act like there's real terrorists and all this fine okay and there are some
[03:19:08.600 --> 03:19:12.640]  real crazies out there that's what you do you run the play to the people you pull
[03:19:12.640 --> 03:19:15.440]  up see who they are if you really think there's terrorists you don't say stop
[03:19:15.440 --> 03:19:20.280]  filming give me a break it's all make believe it's total make believe good
[03:19:20.280 --> 03:19:25.320]  point ma'am go ahead so that the people really need to reflect back to the
[03:19:25.320 --> 03:19:31.080]  powers that be authority cops whoever that it's them they are not above the
[03:19:31.080 --> 03:19:36.200]  laws of physics like they try to think they are overriding the laws of physics
[03:19:36.200 --> 03:19:40.920]  I was able to actually fit my whole yoga practice and while I was on hold
[03:19:40.920 --> 03:19:46.280]  because that's what we need to do we need to bring the mind back to reality
[03:19:46.280 --> 03:19:51.080]  where it belongs and not you know them you know people just making up whatever
[03:19:51.080 --> 03:19:56.000]  rules they want in their head that's completely disconnected from reality and
[03:19:56.000 --> 03:20:00.680]  if I could just plug really quickly this weekend out in Long Island they're
[03:20:00.680 --> 03:20:05.800]  having the save Long Island forum out at Hopoc where Bill Still, G. Edward
[03:20:05.800 --> 03:20:10.240]  Griffin, Charlotte Isherby, I believe one of your guys is going to be there
[03:20:10.240 --> 03:20:16.040]  also Adam Kokesh is going to be speaking there he's not one of my guys but
[03:20:16.040 --> 03:20:20.080]  but but we we we do support what he's done but very exciting God bless you ma'am
[03:20:20.080 --> 03:20:23.640]  let's talk to I just don't want to be all the time I'll have a guest on and
[03:20:23.640 --> 03:20:28.680]  then everything they ever do in the media is Alex Jones reporter or people will
[03:20:28.680 --> 03:20:31.640]  do an info wars report and say they're an info wars reporter and I'm not
[03:20:31.640 --> 03:20:35.760]  distancing myself from Adam Kokesh just he's him I'm me that the only reason I
[03:20:35.760 --> 03:20:39.560]  threw that out God bless you ma'am Simon in Texas you're on the air go ahead
[03:20:39.560 --> 03:20:43.400]  hi Alex thanks for taking my call I just want to talk about the nukes that were
[03:20:43.400 --> 03:20:49.560]  missing out on that West Texas plant and if people take the time to step back
[03:20:49.560 --> 03:20:52.880]  and actually look at the picture of the hole rather than focus on one thing and
[03:20:52.880 --> 03:20:56.840]  you know I'm pretty required to you but for some of your listeners out there that
[03:20:56.840 --> 03:21:00.880]  I think they get focused on one certain thing that they forget to look at it a
[03:21:00.880 --> 03:21:04.600]  whole if you actually take a step back and look at it this thing as a whole you
[03:21:04.600 --> 03:21:09.960]  can kind of see everything is converging and you take the nukes and then the
[03:21:09.960 --> 03:21:14.920]  generals go now you have these officers that you know it's more likely that most
[03:21:14.920 --> 03:21:19.080]  of these officers have a conscience it wouldn't hit that button or then you
[03:21:19.080 --> 03:21:23.720]  look at the the government buying all those tablets you know there's in how
[03:21:23.720 --> 03:21:28.720]  all of us as a collective you know I'm not talking the mass majority that you
[03:21:28.720 --> 03:21:33.320]  know that's right even intelligence you stand back and look at the big picture
[03:21:33.320 --> 03:21:39.760]  it it looks like an oncoming train against freedom and it's it's it's just I
[03:21:39.760 --> 03:21:42.960]  think people get so focused I'm not necessarily talking about your viewers or
[03:21:42.960 --> 03:21:47.080]  something but I think that's what people need to pay attention to you look at you
[03:21:47.080 --> 03:21:51.320]  know in the Bible in the Christian you know I'm a Christian that you look at the
[03:21:51.320 --> 03:21:55.560]  end the end book the revelation and you look at what's happening you see well
[03:21:55.560 --> 03:21:59.480]  okay I could see that happening because all this is happening because well this
[03:21:59.480 --> 03:22:05.040]  is the end game and this is what it's gonna take to get there but anyway with
[03:22:05.040 --> 03:22:11.040]  all those tablets they've bought man how the majority of us the listeners and
[03:22:11.040 --> 03:22:17.960]  stuff we and I know you you feel it that gut feeling that the storm is coming we
[03:22:17.960 --> 03:22:22.040]  we just don't know when or what or from what angle but we know it's out there we
[03:22:22.040 --> 03:22:26.200]  all feel it it's almost a feeling we can't describe and I think that it's
[03:22:26.200 --> 03:22:31.520]  almost a God-given gift but that's all I hear you I've never felt the feelings
[03:22:31.520 --> 03:22:34.640]  I've been feeling the last few months and they're intensifying I've never felt
[03:22:34.640 --> 03:22:41.000]  this feeling you know the closest thing to it is when some bully starts a fight
[03:22:41.000 --> 03:22:44.920]  with you and you're on the and they go ahead and get a shot and it hit you and
[03:22:44.920 --> 03:22:48.200]  then your brain turns on you decide to do what you got to do I mean it's more of
[03:22:48.200 --> 03:22:52.000]  like we're in a fight the storms actually here they're taking down liberty
[03:22:52.000 --> 03:22:57.520]  they're targeting good people bad guys are in control six cents get ready you're
[03:22:57.520 --> 03:23:02.720]  in danger and it's danger danger will Robinson and the storms already here
[03:23:02.720 --> 03:23:07.520]  it's just that the deeper more hardcore levels of it are about to hit and it's
[03:23:07.520 --> 03:23:11.080]  gonna happen in Cascades and just God help us I appreciate your call great
[03:23:11.080 --> 03:23:15.120]  points are you know I'm almost out of time and I've got a few other news

[03:24:11.360 --> 03:24:14.600]  group of civilians seeking to keep their weapons and rein in ruthless
[03:24:14.600 --> 03:24:19.160]  government linked drug cartels which have terrorized their communities you've

[03:24:29.840 --> 03:24:34.040]  international outcry on behalf of the citizens who suffered nonstop brutality
[03:24:34.040 --> 03:24:38.720]  the hands of both government officials and cynical criminal cartels syndicates
[03:24:38.720 --> 03:24:42.440]  news reports some of which conflict with each other suggests that around a
[03:24:42.440 --> 03:24:46.520]  dozen people were shot at least four were killed in a massacre including 11
[03:24:46.520 --> 03:24:49.720]  year old girl a Mexican paper reported that a dozen civilians died in the
[03:24:49.720 --> 03:24:54.400]  clash this is unbelievable and you'll see these guys who have like a single shot

[03:25:06.520 --> 03:25:12.360]  demonic demonic demonic now this video is so important because it illustrates
[03:25:12.360 --> 03:25:16.520]  how to take action and I suggest everyone go to info wars.com and watch it
[03:25:16.520 --> 03:25:21.360]  it's video Obama's FCC had confronted over cell phone radiation I'm gonna
[03:25:21.360 --> 03:25:26.840]  tweet this out at real Alex Jones too I don't think it was tweeted and it shows
[03:25:26.840 --> 03:25:30.080]  people talking about brain tumors increasing they go into confront the
[03:25:30.080 --> 03:25:35.240]  FCC had who says we're looking at acceptable levels that we think are
[03:25:35.240 --> 03:25:39.440]  safe hands down cell phones up against your head in one spot literally cooks
[03:25:39.440 --> 03:25:43.960]  your DNA now have you got it on hands free and keep it away from you every
[03:25:43.960 --> 03:25:48.440]  link out from the size of the microwave transmitter is what engineers
[03:25:48.440 --> 03:25:53.160]  describe it lessens by half the power so even if it's two feet away massive
[03:25:53.160 --> 03:25:56.800]  difference still very bad for you we're bombarded with this cancer is going off
[03:25:56.800 --> 03:26:01.360]  the charts they knew this and they're upping the power of these phones okay
[03:26:01.360 --> 03:26:06.440]  so just to understand that I 90% of the time talk with a wire and still some of
[03:26:06.440 --> 03:26:11.120]  it conduits up from that it's not perfect only use them when you have to I'm
[03:26:11.120 --> 03:26:15.480]  in a war so I work when I'm driving fighting the globalist I do not do a
[03:26:15.480 --> 03:26:18.800]  bunch of socializing or BSing on the phone I make quick phone calls and I'm
[03:26:18.800 --> 03:26:24.440]  done most the time but I know I'm killing myself to live doing that using it as a
[03:26:24.440 --> 03:26:31.120]  military application okay don't give them to your kids stay away from them get

[03:26:41.600 --> 03:26:44.680]  they just filled up the room and kept asking questions at this event here it
[03:26:44.680 --> 03:26:48.480]  is how many people have to die from brain cancer before the federal government
