[00:45.460 --> 00:52.340]  completely wide open phones for the full four hours today Dr. Leonard Horowitz is joining
[00:52.340 --> 01:00.260]  us coming up in an hour and a half headline of the prison planet dot com via federal jack
[01:00.260 --> 01:09.140]  Lynn Horowitz files pandemic charges with the FBI in New York City that's right Dr.
[01:09.140 --> 01:15.900]  Lynn Horowitz is saying the drug industry investigators have uncovered documents exposing
[01:15.900 --> 01:21.100]  an international drug ring operating from New York City that is behind the H1N1 swine
[01:21.100 --> 01:27.620]  flu fright and vaccination preparations Dr. Leonard G Horowitz and Sherry Kane investigative
[01:27.620 --> 01:31.960]  journalists have released evidence in legal affidavit that leaders of a private global
[01:31.960 --> 01:38.660]  biotechnology trust are behind the pandemic flu including its origin and alleged prevention
[01:38.660 --> 01:45.980]  via vaccinations their documents being sent by attorneys to FBI this week evidence industrialist
[01:45.980 --> 01:53.620]  are preparing a crime ring within the partnership for New York City PNYC and are behind the
[01:53.620 --> 02:02.620]  pandemic's creation media brainwashing vaccination preparations and health official promotions
[02:02.620 --> 02:10.140]  David Rockefeller's trust that in ages several powerful partners on Wall Street including
[02:10.140 --> 02:16.540]  media moguls Rupert Murdoch Morton Zuckerman Thomas Glosher and the former chairman of
[02:16.540 --> 02:21.500]  the board of directors the Federal Reserve Bank of New York are implicated in advancing
[02:21.500 --> 02:27.620]  global genocide Dr. Horowitz wrote the FBI directors I need Paul Watson and Steve Watson
[02:27.620 --> 02:34.060]  and Kurt Nemo everybody to do their own breakdowns on this report but Dr. Lynn Horowitz is joining
[02:34.060 --> 02:39.860]  us coming up in an hour and a half you know it's so frightening about all this Dr. Horowitz
[02:39.860 --> 02:48.100]  sometimes at the time what he covers sounds wild but then in every case I've seen it turns
[02:48.100 --> 02:56.780]  out to be accurate remember before the anthrax attacks were launched even before 9 11 he
[02:56.780 --> 03:04.380]  was saying the government was going to launch an anthrax attack and he got visited by the
[03:04.380 --> 03:11.380]  FBI asking if he was behind it a few weeks after 9 11 because he was on record sending
[03:11.380 --> 03:18.260]  letters to the government saying that elements of the biotechnology companies are going to
[03:18.260 --> 03:24.140]  be mailing anthrax and he knew that by different pieces of info he saw in the medical journals
[03:24.140 --> 03:29.820]  different reports from media he could see them preparing the public for it and now here
[03:29.820 --> 03:36.940]  he is an internationally renowned Harvard educated doctor coming out and naming names
[03:36.940 --> 03:45.020]  so we know the Rockefeller's pioneered eugenics even for Hitler we know that they have engineered
[03:45.020 --> 03:51.100]  so much we know they had that secret meeting what was the London Guardian headline also
[03:51.100 --> 04:00.700]  times of London had a similar headline rich have secret meeting in New York call for global
[04:00.700 --> 04:07.060]  government we'll see if we can find that in fact in our computer system we even have the
[04:07.060 --> 04:14.700]  ABC news report on that but we'll be covering all of that coming up a little bit later in
[04:14.700 --> 04:22.340]  the show and this important radio broadcast we also have Andrew Einhorn on talking about
[04:22.340 --> 04:26.660]  all over the country the feds paying with federal grants for the states to take blood
[04:26.660 --> 04:36.020]  without warrants at checkpoints just absolute end to the fourth amendment and we're going
[04:36.020 --> 04:41.220]  to open the phones up on any subject you wish to discuss including newsweek's cover story
[04:41.220 --> 04:46.580]  the case for killing granny curbing excessive end of life care is good for America eugenics
[04:46.580 --> 05:01.460]  being openly pushed 1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 we'll be right back have you heard that millionaire

[08:15.220 --> 08:21.620]  Remember this story back on May 24th, the times of London? ABC News carried it in the US but
[08:21.620 --> 08:27.060]  didn't tell anyone the details of the secret meeting. But speaking to the Rockefeller Foundation,
[08:27.060 --> 08:35.300]  the times of London discovered headline billionaire club in bid to curb overpopulation. America's
[08:35.300 --> 08:41.300]  richest people met to discuss ways of tackling a disastrous environmental, social and industrial
[08:41.300 --> 08:48.020]  threat. Humanity. And at the end they said, we don't want people to think we're an alternative
[08:48.020 --> 08:52.820]  world government, a little word trick because there is a world government. And that was a
[08:53.380 --> 08:58.980]  little snide comment because this was going on the week before the Bilderberg group meeting.
[09:00.100 --> 09:09.940]  Ted Turner, Warren Buffett, Oprah Winfrey, Bill and Melinda Gates, the list went on and on.
[09:12.500 --> 09:17.780]  And at the end of the story, they say, this is something so nightmarish that everyone in
[09:17.780 --> 09:23.060]  this group agreed. It needs big brain answers, said one guest. They need to be an independent
[09:23.060 --> 09:28.340]  of government agencies. We are able to head off a disaster. We all see looming. While all the
[09:28.340 --> 09:34.020]  secrecy, they wanted to speak rich to rich without worrying about, they said, would end up in the
[09:34.020 --> 09:41.780]  newspapers painting them as an alternative world government. He said, they have quotes from the
[09:41.780 --> 09:46.580]  Rockefeller Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation here telling you it was about
[09:46.580 --> 09:56.340]  curbing world population. Then you see headlines like this one in Newsweek. Is your baby racist
[09:56.340 --> 10:00.820]  due to their carbon footprint? That was two weeks ago, this week's issue. The case for
[10:00.820 --> 10:06.740]  killing granny, curbing excessive end of life care is good for America by Evan Thomas.
[10:07.940 --> 10:14.900]  Another sickening article, also a cover story. I was a teenage death panelist. Very, very sick.
[10:14.900 --> 10:25.380]  Now, you dovetail that with this article up on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com from the good
[10:25.380 --> 10:33.060]  folks in Florida at federal jack. Lynn Horowitz files pandemic charges with FBI in New York City.
[10:33.060 --> 10:40.340]  He's coming up. Friends, the substance of the message below on a false flag H1N1 flu pandemic
[10:40.340 --> 10:45.060]  has widely discussed on the net for months, but the message indicates the first serious U.S. legal
[10:45.060 --> 10:49.780]  action I have seen on it. I have with the help of many been tracking this issue and its effects
[10:51.860 --> 10:57.700]  in the states and localities anticipating the need to file injunctive lawsuits via,
[10:57.700 --> 11:02.260]  this is from Horowitz, any government's taking steps to compel vaccination.
[11:03.540 --> 11:08.100]  It is presumed by Dr. Horowitz and others that government will attempt to compel vaccination
[11:08.100 --> 11:14.020]  of H1N1 virus vaccine, which is not possible under current law, especially U.S. Constitution,
[11:14.020 --> 11:19.940]  state Constitution laws for many first amendment and related privacy and civil rights reasons.
[11:19.940 --> 11:28.420]  Well, it's more than that. It's state laws state that you can't compel someone to take
[11:28.420 --> 11:31.380]  something into their body, but they've been trying to eat away at that.
[11:31.380 --> 11:38.740]  But they do have executive orders they claim override under emergency edicts and continuity
[11:38.740 --> 11:51.220]  of government that continuing. Drug industry investigators have uncovered documents exposing
[11:51.220 --> 11:59.300]  an international drug ring operating from New York City is behind the H1N1 swine flu fright
[11:59.300 --> 12:04.660]  and vaccination preparations. Dr. Lynn Gergy Horowitz and Sherry Kane and investigative
[12:04.660 --> 12:09.860]  journalists have released evidence in legal avidavits that leaders of a private global
[12:09.860 --> 12:14.980]  biotechnology trust are behind the pandemic flu, including its origin and alleged prevention via
[12:14.980 --> 12:22.420]  vaccinations. They're documents being sent by attorneys to the FBI this week. Evidence industrialist
[12:22.420 --> 12:30.980]  are operating a crime ring within the partnership for New York City, PNYC, and are behind the
[12:30.980 --> 12:38.500]  pandemic's creation vaccination programs and health official promotions. David Rockefeller's
[12:38.500 --> 12:44.980]  trust that engages several powerful partners on Wall Street, including media mogul, Rupert Murdoch,
[12:44.980 --> 12:50.020]  Morton Zuckerman, Thomas Gloscher, and former chairman of the board of directors, the Federal
[12:50.020 --> 12:58.260]  Reserve Bank of New York, Jerry Spear, are implicated in advancing global genocide Dr. Horowitz
[12:58.260 --> 13:12.500]  wrote to the FBI directors. This partnership controls biotechnology research and development
[13:12.500 --> 13:19.620]  globally. Health commerce international is also controlled virtually entirely by this trust that
[13:19.620 --> 13:24.980]  also exercises near complete control over mainstream media to promote, propagandize its
[13:24.980 --> 13:29.860]  products and services for the drug cartels organized crime Horowitz continued to say.
[13:30.420 --> 13:35.620]  This trust, in essence, makes or breaks medical and natural healing markets primarily through
[13:35.620 --> 13:41.140]  the mass media companies and propaganda it wields for social engineering and market building Dr.
[13:41.140 --> 13:45.620]  Horowitz wrote. Dr. Horowitz has a lot of courage, folks, we need to be praying for him and this
[13:45.620 --> 13:53.060]  investigative journalist that he is working with, Sherry Kane. By the way, go ahead and tell
[13:53.060 --> 13:58.260]  do please to call Horowitz and let's go ahead and get Sherry Kane on in the fourth hour after
[13:58.260 --> 14:03.380]  Horowitz leaves us. Sherry Kane in the fourth hour. Let's go for that if not tomorrow.
[14:05.540 --> 14:12.660]  You guys got me on that one? Awesome. Continuing among the revelations from
[14:12.660 --> 14:18.100]  the Horowitz Kane research are those linking Larry Silverstein of Silverstein Properties Inc
[14:18.100 --> 14:23.140]  and the 911 terror attacks of the drug cartels geopolitical economic and population reduction
[14:23.140 --> 14:27.300]  activities. Mr. Silverstein, leaser of the World Trade Center authorized at building seven pulled
[14:30.900 --> 14:37.380]  is a chief suspect in the 911 truth investigation. Silverstein is currently landlord and co-partner
[14:37.380 --> 14:43.060]  in the biotechnology trust founded by David Rockefeller implicated by these new discoveries.
[14:43.620 --> 14:49.940]  Given the unprecedented nature and urgency of these findings, Dr. Horowitz has posted his
[14:49.940 --> 14:56.180]  affidavit for public view at flu scam dot com or we have that posted up on info wars dot com
[14:56.180 --> 15:05.620]  and prison planet dot com. Hoping widespread dissemination will prompt governments worldwide
[15:05.620 --> 15:12.500]  to cease mass vaccinations preparations to avoid becoming accessories. This time I contacted the
[15:12.500 --> 15:17.940]  FBI. I warned them about the impending anthrax attacks. This is Horowitz and he's on record.
[15:17.940 --> 15:22.980]  I covered this at the time. Last time I contacted the FBI, I warned about the impending anthrax attacks
[15:22.980 --> 15:27.300]  one week before the first mailings were announced in the press that are Horowitz recalled. It took
[15:27.300 --> 15:32.100]  them six months to respond. When they did, they made me a suspect in the mailings. This time I am
[15:32.100 --> 15:36.900]  writing with justice department a month before the deadliest genocide in history. I'm praying they'll
[15:36.900 --> 15:43.380]  take kindly to my appeal for the P NYC investigation. The court ordered injunction to stop the
[15:43.380 --> 15:50.660]  vaccinations for public protection. This man has unprecedented courage. And unfortunately,
[15:50.660 --> 15:56.900]  he has an amazing track record of being right. I wish he was wrong. Do come on in brother. Come on
[15:56.900 --> 16:00.820]  in. Things are moving quickly here. I was up here till two in the morning working on fall the
[16:00.820 --> 16:05.140]  republic. That's why I got in late this morning. So we're doing some battle planning here on air.
[16:05.140 --> 16:09.940]  I want you to go ahead. I know we're going, I know we got Horowitz on at 12 30 in an hour and
[16:09.940 --> 16:13.940]  then 15 minutes. I know we have another guest coming up after him. This is so important.
[16:17.540 --> 16:20.260]  We may need to look at that because I know Horowitz can stay longer. We may need to look at
[16:20.260 --> 16:22.900]  moving that other guest. If he can't do it, I don't know what we're going to do because I may
[16:22.900 --> 16:28.340]  have to cancel that other guest or movie. This is too important. I also want to get his partner,
[16:28.340 --> 16:34.500]  this investigative journalist on separately in the fourth hour or separately tomorrow because
[16:35.780 --> 16:43.460]  this is important. Rob Horowitz, as he points out at the end of this article, he predicted
[16:45.380 --> 16:50.340]  months and months and months before the anthrax memory serves. It was too much. You can pull
[16:50.340 --> 16:56.180]  up his original press release and then it took him four months after the attacks of October
[16:56.180 --> 17:02.820]  to then come to his house and accuse him of doing it. How did you know this? And he explained it
[17:02.820 --> 17:06.260]  all and gave him the names. And then it later came out in investigations that his links were
[17:06.260 --> 17:10.660]  correct. We're going to ask Horowitz today how he knows this, how he does this. I know he said
[17:10.660 --> 17:15.220]  he has sources and can look at the propaganda and can also track where it comes from. And
[17:15.220 --> 17:20.020]  he's really a smart guy. But I'm hoping he's wrong here. I mean, we know that Baxter with
[17:20.020 --> 17:23.940]  the weaponized bird flu, mixing it with vaccines, that got caught with the grace of God on
[17:23.940 --> 17:30.260]  telegraph reported on that. We know all this is going on. But I mean, I have really been disturbed
[17:30.260 --> 17:34.740]  the last week or so concerning the flu as everybody knows. I can hardly sleep last night.
[17:35.940 --> 17:41.140]  And I think we're on the verge of something really big. And whether it's something big with him
[17:41.140 --> 17:44.820]  launching an attack or whether Horowitz is completely correct or partially correct
[17:45.540 --> 17:50.340]  on this, and we may be on the verge of stopping all of this, also called Kurt. I know we have
[17:50.340 --> 17:54.740]  most of these posted, but I want to post the original in case his site goes down the original
[17:54.740 --> 17:59.620]  at flu scam.com, the original affidavit that he's put out. So please call Kurt and have him
[18:00.260 --> 18:04.420]  post that at mfallwars.com top story, just the affidavit itself. I need everybody to go on this
[18:04.420 --> 18:09.380]  full time. I know I saw this yesterday and barely mentioned it on air because I'm so focused on
[18:09.380 --> 18:15.220]  fall of the Republic. But again, we're just wargaming this out right now live for everybody here on
[18:15.220 --> 18:25.700]  air. So launch on that as fast as you can. Okay. Thank you so much. In fact, in fact,
[18:25.700 --> 18:28.900]  I'm just going to make the decision right now. Horowitz said he could do more than 30 minutes,
[18:28.900 --> 18:33.140]  but we have that other guest at one. Let's go Horowitz, but just nail it down before we move
[18:33.140 --> 18:38.500]  the other guest or cancel them. Einhorn, go ahead and have him 1230 to 130 instead of 1230 to one.
[18:38.500 --> 18:42.660]  And then and then and then and make sure that we can do that with him. Then we'll move Einhorn,
[18:42.660 --> 18:47.940]  if not moving to tomorrow. Thank you. That's important as well with but you coordinate with
[18:48.660 --> 18:53.860]  Hartman. Again, we just have to do this live on air. We're doing so much here. Things are moving
[18:53.860 --> 19:00.820]  so quickly that I don't want to say I'm overwhelmed. They're trying to drink
[19:02.820 --> 19:08.740]  Lake Superior through a pixie straw through a Dixie straw. One of the straws you stir coffee with
[19:08.740 --> 19:12.340]  with. And I don't want to say I have mixed feelings about everything that's happening.
[19:12.340 --> 19:18.420]  It's more of just so many points, so many pieces of data, so many revelations,
[19:18.420 --> 19:23.700]  so many understandings coming so fast and so many integrated systems of analysis.
[19:24.980 --> 19:30.020]  As I totally immerse myself in this, it just makes my head spin. Know this, we are on the verge
[19:30.020 --> 19:34.740]  of a global transformation. All that is needed is the right crises and the people will relinquish
[19:34.740 --> 19:38.900]  their rights and liberties to a new world order. That, of course, is a quote from David Rockefeller.
[19:39.700 --> 19:44.660]  And that is the point we're now reaching. We're at jump point into total world tyranny, total
[19:44.660 --> 19:50.180]  eugenics that will make Hitler, Stalin and Mao all rolled up together look like a cakewalk,
[19:50.180 --> 19:55.700]  a tea party, a Sunday school meeting. And everybody needs to be praying, needs to be repenting,
[19:55.700 --> 19:59.780]  needs to be getting right with God and needs to be getting the word out like our lives depend on it.
[19:59.780 --> 20:05.540]  The phone rings and the questions are asked. I've been so sick. Will the life change tea

[22:08.660 --> 22:12.740]  complete. Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are
[22:12.740 --> 22:17.140]  orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[22:17.140 --> 22:23.380]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were
[22:23.380 --> 22:28.420]  carried out by British intelligence. Terror Storm Chronicles, the lies that took us to war in Iran,
[22:28.420 --> 22:33.940]  a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture,
[22:33.940 --> 22:38.820]  the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more. Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the
[22:38.820 --> 22:43.780]  history of government-sponsored terrorism. It's an anthology of government crimes. Terror Storm

[23:59.700 --> 24:07.540]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show because there's
[24:07.540 --> 24:15.620]  a war on for your mind.
[24:15.620 --> 24:30.260]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is a complete war room in here.
[24:34.020 --> 24:37.700]  We're going to open the phones up in the next segment and just get callers response to everything
[24:37.700 --> 24:47.540]  that's happening, everything that's going on. Separately, there's a lot happening in telecommunications
[24:47.540 --> 24:53.780]  and with the internet. ICANN is basically discussing the private slash government consortium that
[24:53.780 --> 25:00.020]  controls the internet and the issuance of domain names is openly discussing just turning it all
[25:00.020 --> 25:07.780]  over to the Pentagon. The FCC is having three meetings with public hearings, one of them
[25:07.780 --> 25:13.140]  ending in the next 30 minutes in Austin, Texas. FCC announces initial broadband field hearings
[25:14.020 --> 25:17.700]  where they are going to take over the entire broadband spectrum and basically have government
[25:17.700 --> 25:24.260]  broadcast on it. It just gets more and more insane by the minute. The globalists are moving
[25:24.260 --> 25:34.180]  on every front. The dollar is falling to record lows. Commodities are exploding in prices.
[25:35.460 --> 25:45.700]  I have this Horowitz affidavit to the FBI dealing with the flu. It's like I'm living
[25:45.700 --> 25:51.300]  in the twilight zone. The cover of newsweeks is saying kill old people. I mean,
[25:51.300 --> 25:58.900]  you know, I say I have this rush of different ideas and thoughts and feelings. We're being
[25:58.900 --> 26:04.340]  conditioned. We're being turned against each other. We're being trained to fight with each
[26:04.340 --> 26:08.820]  other. We're being trained to be balkanized. Meanwhile, this elite is just having their way
[26:08.820 --> 26:13.540]  with us out of one side of their mouth saying they don't want to restrict care for the old or
[26:13.540 --> 26:18.580]  handicapped or mentally ill or sick. But then all over the news, they push how good it is
[26:18.580 --> 26:23.060]  and how they want one child policies and how they're going to tax everybody and 15 million
[26:23.060 --> 26:28.420]  dollar fines at garage sales. If you sell any recalled toy or product, when no one has any
[26:28.420 --> 26:38.900]  idea what's been recalled over the last decade, the police all over the country are taking
[26:38.900 --> 26:43.540]  blood at warrantless checkpoints under federal grants. I mean, sucking blood without warrants
[26:43.540 --> 26:54.340]  and it just goes on and on and on and on and on and on and Gardasil admittedly is killing people.
[26:54.980 --> 26:59.220]  The flu shots, every time they give them every year, kill people and cause people to get really
[26:59.220 --> 27:05.300]  sick. It's eugenics. We know it's eugenics. We know they're killing us and you can't get most of
[27:05.300 --> 27:10.260]  the police or people that serve the government to wake up. They think it's funny. It's not funny
[27:10.260 --> 27:17.140]  when the cover to Newsweek says the case for killing granny. I mean, it's not funny anymore.
[27:22.340 --> 27:25.860]  And I say I have again, not mixed feelings or rush of feelings.
[27:27.140 --> 27:31.460]  I know I have to fight this. I want to fight this. My instincts, my soul, my heart want to
[27:31.460 --> 27:37.620]  fight it 110%. But at the same time, I'm sick of having to focus on it. And then I get a lot of
[27:37.620 --> 27:42.820]  anger towards the general public who won't focus on any of it. And that's why this has been allowed
[27:42.820 --> 27:52.020]  to get so bad. That's why things have gotten so out of control. Because the general public will
[27:52.020 --> 27:56.420]  do nothing to defend their liberty or freedom, nothing to study the scientific dictatorship
[27:56.420 --> 28:03.460]  that's been just designed and built all around us. And then when we're here telling people the
[28:03.460 --> 28:08.660]  God's honest truth, some people in the general population laugh at us and think it's all funny.
[28:08.660 --> 28:14.420]  It's not funny. And I look at fake patriots like Glenn Beck up there fooling people and taking
[28:14.420 --> 28:19.060]  control of the tea parties and manipulating it and knowing he's a servant of the new world order
[28:19.060 --> 28:23.780]  and knowing he's leading people into destruction and bondage and knowing it's a fraud. And then I
[28:23.780 --> 28:29.220]  asked, how can he know all of this and serve the evil? How do they get so many people to
[28:29.220 --> 28:35.300]  willfully destroy their own future and their own lives and to bring in this abomination of tyranny?
[28:36.340 --> 28:39.940]  Why do people love to serve darkness and serve evil?
[28:43.140 --> 28:48.420]  And I'm telling you, the feelings I had where I intellectually look at all the thousands of
[28:48.420 --> 28:55.140]  pieces of evidence and facts, the same feelings I had right before 9 11, I'm having those feelings
[28:55.140 --> 29:05.700]  at a level, an entire order of intensity greater, an entire magnitude higher.
[29:06.420 --> 29:16.820]  It is so intense, I can barely even do this radio show today. And at the core of my instincts,
[29:16.820 --> 29:23.700]  at the core of my intellectual analysis, at the core of who I am,
[29:28.420 --> 29:36.740]  it is an intense intellectual, but also emotional gut understanding that the new world order is
[29:36.740 --> 29:44.020]  preparing a strike. Israel is openly saying they're getting ready to hit Iran. Russia is giving the
[29:44.020 --> 29:52.820]  green light. This is off the charts. Prepare yourselves. We're on the march. The empire's
[29:52.820 --> 30:02.820]  on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important
[30:02.820 --> 30:07.540]  questions. If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much
[30:07.540 --> 30:13.060]  ammunition do you want? My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives
[30:13.060 --> 30:18.340]  of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it?
[30:18.340 --> 30:23.460]  Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification?
[30:23.460 --> 30:28.340]  Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed
[30:28.340 --> 30:33.460]  yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if
[30:33.460 --> 30:39.380]  you have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much
[30:39.380 --> 30:44.980]  will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of
[30:44.980 --> 30:52.980]  you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web
[30:52.980 --> 30:58.820]  at eFoodsDirect.com. Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[31:00.900 --> 31:06.740]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[31:06.740 --> 31:11.380]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful,
[31:11.380 --> 31:17.780]  just as strong, just as well-funded. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that
[31:17.780 --> 31:22.900]  Obama is working for the best interests of the American people. While Obama's already fudging.
[31:22.900 --> 31:28.260]  Yeah, fudged since day one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement
[31:28.260 --> 31:34.660]  of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance
[31:34.660 --> 31:40.500]  oligarchs, that's fascism. It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government.
[31:40.500 --> 31:48.260]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy
[31:48.260 --> 31:55.620]  of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv,

[33:10.500 --> 33:14.660]  Okay, I'm going to play a seven minute clip of former Homeland Security director
[33:14.660 --> 33:29.460]  Churdoff on C-SPAN last Friday. And in the space of just 10 minutes, because I've gone and watched
[33:29.460 --> 33:40.580]  the original full broadcast, every single caller called in to say 9-11 was an inside job, military
[33:40.580 --> 33:46.260]  people, you name it. And Churdoff would just throw out the emotional disinformation of, oh,
[33:46.260 --> 33:52.180]  you're like Holocaust deniers or you're crazy. And one caller definitely responding 20 minutes
[33:52.180 --> 34:00.500]  with the president by Charlie Sheen. One caller points out that six of the 10 commission members,
[34:00.500 --> 34:06.100]  according to Washington Post, are saying the official story is a lie, a fraud, the commission
[34:06.100 --> 34:12.180]  was a lie, a criminal coverup, a whitewash, and these are quotes. And Churdoff just says that's
[34:12.180 --> 34:19.060]  ridiculous. But the point is, a mass awakening has happened. That is why the establishment is
[34:19.060 --> 34:24.100]  going to stage terror attacks or launch a new war against Iran or release a deadly flu or something
[34:24.100 --> 34:31.620]  else and say it's the flu. That's why they've got to move to bring in their total police state and
[34:31.620 --> 34:37.460]  they need a crisis as the pretext or the cover for that. So it's the best of times, it's the worst
[34:37.460 --> 34:43.780]  of times, as has been said many times, in that the mass awakening is happening. And so the
[34:43.780 --> 34:48.260]  establishment with their entire agenda is stalling. They want their new bank of the world,
[34:48.260 --> 34:53.620]  they want their open borders, they want their government takeover of 20% of the economy with
[34:53.620 --> 34:59.300]  the healthcare, they want one-child policies, they want it all, they want it now, and they're not
[34:59.300 --> 35:04.500]  going to get it unless they're able to have crises. Now, there's pauses in this video that's been
[35:04.500 --> 35:09.300]  linked up throughout the weekend at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com, playing the audio here.
[35:09.300 --> 35:14.340]  There's pauses in it where it has the text moments later, and it is moments later,
[35:14.980 --> 35:18.900]  to making the point that call after call after call after call after call after call after call
[35:18.900 --> 35:24.900]  after call after call after call is bringing up real facts to him. And they try to change the
[35:24.900 --> 35:31.620]  subject and go to more calls. Remember, four years ago, 84% of Americans believe the official
[35:31.620 --> 35:37.700]  story is a lie in a major New York Times poll, CNN poll from three years ago. 83%
[35:38.500 --> 35:43.060]  agreed with Charlie Sheen that 9-11 is a fraud. In that poll, remember that poll, we cover in
[35:43.060 --> 35:48.740]  Terror Storm. There's a lot of other polls, they like to focus on one that says 37% believe the
[35:48.740 --> 35:53.300]  government carried out the attacks. But if you ask people, if you believe there's a cover-up,
[35:53.300 --> 35:59.700]  80 plus percent in every poll I've seen, but 37% believe the government carried out the attacks.
[35:59.700 --> 36:04.420]  That's the one the media always says. They always spin it and say 30 plus percent believe the
[36:04.420 --> 36:11.460]  government is lying. No, in the poll of 37%, the scientific poll, that was asked, did you believe
[36:11.460 --> 36:15.300]  the government did it? And to take a phone call at your home from a pollster and to have the will
[36:15.300 --> 36:23.300]  and the courage to say, inside job, 36, 37%, that's just amazing. So let's go ahead and play
[36:23.300 --> 36:31.700]  Chertoff, absolutely collapsing. The official story collapsing live on TV, every caller,
[36:31.700 --> 36:34.900]  and they finally just quit taking calls when they normally take it for the full hour. They
[36:34.900 --> 36:38.660]  usually talk about 10 minutes and then take 50 minutes of calls. It just collapsed. They just
[36:38.660 --> 36:46.340]  quit taking calls. Here it is. Michael Chertoff, St. Petersburg, Florida, William, independent line.
[36:46.340 --> 36:53.700]  Hi. Hello. Good morning, gentlemen. Morning. You mentioned the September 10th, 2001 mindset.
[36:54.500 --> 36:59.540]  That made me nervous. I think it should be September 9th. I was wondering if the missing
[36:59.540 --> 37:08.660]  $2 trillion plus that Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld reported on September 10th,
[37:08.660 --> 37:13.620]  2001, where those trillions went. Did you all ever find it?
[37:14.580 --> 37:20.500]  I have to say, I must have missed that news report about the missing trillions. I do know
[37:20.500 --> 37:26.180]  that in the run-up to September 11th, the 9-11 Commission looked back at what had been done
[37:26.180 --> 37:32.580]  and what hadn't been done, and I think they found the key problem was collecting information
[37:32.580 --> 37:38.260]  and fusing information so that we could get the best possible picture of the threat we faced.
[37:38.260 --> 37:43.940]  In the Cold War, we worried about bombers and missiles attacking the United States,
[37:43.940 --> 37:49.940]  and that's why we had radar. In the war involving terrorists, we don't have radar that's going to
[37:49.940 --> 37:55.220]  detect bombs and missiles that are going to prevent attacks. What we have is intelligence,
[37:55.220 --> 38:00.900]  and the ability to gather and analyze and integrate all that intelligence is the
[38:00.900 --> 38:05.700]  principle way in which we protect ourselves. Your predecessor, Tom Ridge,
[38:09.460 --> 38:13.380]  and now Mark and Gwen Michigan, you've got your volume down, I know, and you go ahead
[38:13.380 --> 38:17.300]  with your question for Secretary Shirtoff. Yes, hello, Mr. Shirtoff.
[38:17.300 --> 38:22.580]  Hello, Mark. I wanted to let you know that I called the Department of Homeland Security
[38:22.580 --> 38:29.220]  and was trying to give them information. They connected me with the FBI, and as soon as I
[38:29.220 --> 38:35.780]  mentioned the wealthy elite, they cut me off. I called back the Department of Homeland Security
[38:35.780 --> 38:41.300]  and asked them, I'm trying to get the Department of Homeland Security some very important information.
[38:41.300 --> 38:45.940]  They connected me back to the FBI. Mark, what is that important information?
[38:45.940 --> 38:49.780]  What is that important information? That important information is called the
[38:49.780 --> 38:56.500]  wealthy elite. We have overwhelming evidence to prove that these people have taken control
[38:56.500 --> 39:01.460]  of the United States federal government. They are the ones that attacked us on 9-11.
[39:02.020 --> 39:06.340]  So, Mr. Shirtoff, if that man has information he wants to share, where would you recommend he send?
[39:06.340 --> 39:10.340]  Well, I think they did the right thing. They sent him to the FBI. If someone wants to alleged
[39:10.340 --> 39:16.420]  crime or a threat, usually the FBI is the first respondent, and they have to evaluate whether
[39:16.420 --> 39:23.780]  they think there's any actual evidence to proceed. But normally the FBI is very responsive if there's
[39:23.780 --> 39:28.580]  a serious, you know, credible piece of information. What's your general viewpoint about people who
[39:28.580 --> 39:33.380]  think the federal government was involved in 9-11? I think that that's in the same category as
[39:33.380 --> 39:38.100]  Holocaust denial, and those people who still aren't convinced that President Obama was born in Hawaii.
[39:38.100 --> 39:47.060]  It's kind of a kind of out there conspiracy theory, which does not warrant a lot of attention.
[39:47.860 --> 39:50.660]  Mandy in New Orleans, your own with Michael Shirtoff. Please go ahead.
[39:51.300 --> 39:57.380]  Yes, thank you. Would you please allow me a follow-up, because I know predictably what this man will
[39:57.380 --> 40:05.380]  answer to my questions. Mr. Shirtoff, please do not feign ignorance on this, because if I can find
[40:05.380 --> 40:15.380]  this out, certainly you know it. Recently, six of the 10 9-11 commissioners have stated publicly
[40:16.340 --> 40:23.700]  that the 9-11 commission was hogwash, that it was set up to fail, and it was a whitewash.
[40:24.420 --> 40:32.180]  Recently, that the publications, nine scientists that were given debris from the World Trade Centers
[40:32.180 --> 40:37.300]  have found evidence of nanothermite, a high-grade military explosive.
[40:37.300 --> 40:41.140]  Okay, Mandy, thank you. We're going to leave it there, because we know where you're going.
[40:41.140 --> 40:46.180]  Mr. Shirtoff, you've addressed that question. Yeah, I mean, again, this crops up from time
[40:46.180 --> 40:51.300]  to time, and it has been looked at thoroughly by everybody. Frankly, you have people who
[40:51.300 --> 40:56.580]  witnessed the planes going into the buildings. I mean, I have to say it's like Holocaust denial,
[40:56.580 --> 41:02.500]  and the people who believe the president was not born in Hawaii. It's just a myth.
[41:06.180 --> 41:08.500]  Orlando, Florida. Nelson, Democrat. Hi.
[41:10.820 --> 41:16.500]  Well, Nelson is gone, it appears, and we will move on to Haysville, Georgia, Clyde, Independent.
[41:17.220 --> 41:20.260]  Yes, good morning. Good morning, Peter. Good morning, Mr. Shirtoff.
[41:20.260 --> 41:27.940]  Morning. Excuse me, I have about 33 years in the military, five years working for the Department
[41:27.940 --> 41:36.740]  of Defense, and to this day, I still see the cover up on 9-11. We know that Abel Danger,
[41:36.740 --> 41:44.580]  which infiltrated the terrorist activities, had photographs of the terrorists, had knew that
[41:44.580 --> 41:53.780]  they had a plan to attack targets, and a report went forward that on either Clinton's desk,
[41:53.780 --> 42:00.020]  that I believe was 98, 99, or Jamie Gorellick's desk, and it was never acted on.
[42:00.900 --> 42:04.740]  You write in your book about calling, you call this a generational challenge,
[42:04.740 --> 42:09.380]  and questionably the threats we face constitute a generational challenge to our nation. What
[42:09.380 --> 42:14.420]  do you mean by that? What I mean is that the 21st century is a different kind of warfare than
[42:14.420 --> 42:20.100]  the 20th century. The 20th century, we were used to having massed armies, you know, the enemy came
[42:20.100 --> 42:25.540]  over the hill, you could see the cloud of dust, people wore uniforms, and there were a set of
[42:25.540 --> 42:31.380]  rules and principles that were very clear. The 21st century is different. The enemy is networked.
[42:31.380 --> 42:34.820]  The line between the military and the criminal has really been obliterated.
[42:35.380 --> 42:41.300]  We have to use a combination of defense and law enforcement. We can't choose one or the other.
[42:41.300 --> 42:47.540]  So we're facing a new kind of warfare. It's unfortunately leveraged by the technological
[42:47.540 --> 42:51.860]  revolution, which means that a smaller and smaller number of people can do more and more
[42:51.860 --> 42:58.100]  damage, as we saw in 9-11. And that means we have to completely retool and reconfigure our strategy
[42:58.100 --> 43:03.380]  and our menu of options in dealing with this kind of threat. We can't afford to have
[43:04.180 --> 43:09.220]  boxes and silos anymore. We have to have an open architecture for how we deal with this
[43:09.220 --> 43:11.380]  new, very, very dangerous challenge.
[43:11.380 --> 43:18.820]  And do you think the way the intelligence community is organized today is better than it was?
[43:19.540 --> 43:21.700]  And have we gotten to that point where we're sharing?
[43:21.700 --> 43:27.300]  Peter, it's clearly better and there is more sharing, but it's not completely where it needs
[43:27.300 --> 43:32.100]  to be. And I'd say there are a couple of areas where that's true. One is we still tend to view
[43:32.900 --> 43:38.260]  what goes on overseas and what goes on over here as two separate domains. And the fact of the matter
[43:38.260 --> 43:42.580]  is particularly with the Internet, you can't draw that distinction. So we have to have a more
[43:42.580 --> 43:47.620]  seamless intelligence capability. The second thing is our legal principles have not kept up with
[43:47.620 --> 43:53.860]  the new challenges. One of the problems I think we faced right after 9-11 is rules had been written
[43:54.420 --> 43:59.700]  for dealing with foreign intelligence and how we surveil it. Back in the days of, you know,
[43:59.700 --> 44:04.980]  we were worried about the Soviet Union or other countries. And while we still have concerns about
[44:04.980 --> 44:10.420]  nation states, the issue of terrorism is now equal in importance. And we didn't have a legal model
[44:10.420 --> 44:14.820]  that helped us deal with that. So one of the things I think Congress hasn't done and needs to do
[44:15.380 --> 44:21.140]  is to actually sit down and think through in a bipartisan way. What is the legal architecture
[44:21.140 --> 44:28.100]  we need to deal with this 21st century challenge? Okay, let's break down what Chertoff was just
[44:28.100 --> 44:33.380]  saying there. Number one, he laughed and said, I never heard a $2 trillion missing,
[44:33.380 --> 44:37.780]  even though there were congressional hearings about it, and it was in the Associated Press
[44:37.780 --> 44:41.460]  and the Oregonian. That's just two articles I'm throwing out there that I have memorized
[44:43.540 --> 44:50.020]  that were many others. Now, it was over $4 trillion. It was over $4 trillion in 2007.
[44:50.020 --> 44:56.660]  I've never seen another hearing on it. I have never heard about it in the media since then,
[44:56.660 --> 45:04.020]  at $4 trillion. At $4 trillion, to be technical, it was 3.9 something.
[45:05.940 --> 45:10.020]  So right at $4 trillion, and you say, how can that happen? It was all the pension funds. It was
[45:10.020 --> 45:16.420]  all the veterans funds, all the funds to pay for the VA's. Obama did propose eight months ago.
[45:17.940 --> 45:25.140]  He proposed a month into office, remember? And we had the head of the American Legion on,
[45:25.140 --> 45:30.260]  and it was national news. He proposed in a meeting with him, making veterans pay for their own
[45:30.260 --> 45:33.940]  insurance and taking money out of their paychecks. That's what's going to happen to all Americans
[45:35.380 --> 45:39.140]  if they have their way. I mean, for heaven's sakes, they're on the cover of Newsweek saying
[45:39.140 --> 45:45.380]  the case for killing Granny. That's the cover. That's what they're doing. Tom Daschle wrote a
[45:45.380 --> 45:50.260]  book saying restrict care to handicaps in the old and people with preexisting conditions.
[45:51.300 --> 45:54.500]  And then every time we point out their own writings, they call us conspiracy theorists.
[45:54.500 --> 45:59.220]  It's a psychological warfare technique. So we're arguing all day on whether it exists or not
[45:59.220 --> 46:03.220]  while their agenda and the legislation goes forward. That's a tactic. It's a military tactic.
[46:03.860 --> 46:09.140]  Then he goes on to say, well, we have a new shadowy enemy. We can't really beat
[46:09.140 --> 46:12.740]  and a shadowy enemy that makes everybody basically a potential terrorist. And that's
[46:12.740 --> 46:16.100]  what they want. That's why they love the flu. It makes everybody a potential
[46:16.820 --> 46:20.180]  carrier of the flu. So everybody loses their rights. And now the police have to take your
[46:20.180 --> 46:25.300]  blood without warrants under federal grants. It's all about getting rid of the Bill of Rights in
[46:25.300 --> 46:32.660]  your face. But the bigger issue here is their 9-11 fraud is collapsing. And it's been completely
[46:33.220 --> 46:38.900]  re-energized thanks to Charlie Sheen and thanks to all of you, the activists and 20 minutes with
[46:38.900 --> 46:44.740]  the president. That has been conservatively read by tens of millions worldwide, millions and millions
[46:44.740 --> 46:49.780]  and millions in the U.S., hundreds of newspapers linked to the 20 minutes with the president
[46:49.780 --> 46:54.820]  at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. Major magazines have been calling us the last week
[46:54.820 --> 47:01.540]  wanting to run it and upcoming issues. It is really a huge story. And I want to commend Charlie for
[47:01.540 --> 47:07.060]  his courage. Now I'm going to start taking your calls. Dr. Horowitz will be with us for a full hour
[47:07.620 --> 47:14.260]  coming up in about 45 minutes from the bottom of the next hour to the bottom of the third hour.
[47:14.260 --> 47:19.700]  So stay with us for that. Dr. Lynn Horowitz files pandemic charges with FBI New York City
[47:19.700 --> 47:27.780]  his affidavit is posted at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com right now. Let's go to Bob in
[47:27.780 --> 47:35.860]  Pennsylvania. Bob, you're on the air. Hi, Alex. Hey, buddy. Yes, I am. Yeah. I always wanted to ask
[47:35.860 --> 47:41.220]  you this one question. It's kind of unrelated. But where do you come down on that William Greer
[47:41.220 --> 47:46.980]  driver shot the president thing? I think it's absolute baloney. I've talked to the eyewitnesses.
[47:46.980 --> 47:57.780]  I've blown up the video of it. It just isn't true. Are you there? Yeah. Bob, I appreciate your call.
[47:57.780 --> 48:04.900]  We've got major flu pandemic level six declared. We've got open discussions of 379,000 regular
[48:04.900 --> 48:10.180]  army and Marine Corps troops they want to put on the streets of America. And you know, we have open
[48:10.180 --> 48:17.940]  phones here. It's just that I've been making a JFK film for almost four years now. And it's so deep.
[48:17.940 --> 48:21.300]  And I try to get my facts so right that I haven't even released it or finished it.
[48:22.020 --> 48:27.700]  Because the subject is so huge. But the police, the witnesses, the citizens saw shots being fired
[48:27.700 --> 48:34.660]  from the grassy knoll. There's even photos of the poofs of gunpowder smoke. We always knew that
[48:34.660 --> 48:41.700]  E Howard Hunt, top CIA black ops commander. Ethan Hunt is what the mission impossible
[48:41.700 --> 48:47.220]  characters named after. He did a deathbed confession on video and audio to his son.
[48:48.020 --> 48:53.220]  And there was no shooter in the car. But the government killed Kennedy. There's no doubt about
[48:53.220 --> 48:59.460]  that. But instead, everybody obsesses over whether it was the Secret Service driver. No, they wouldn't
[48:59.460 --> 49:06.340]  do it that way right out in front of everybody. Okay. The car was shot full of holes. That's why
[49:06.340 --> 49:14.020]  they took the limousine and had it chopped up and rebuilt. Kathy in New Orleans, you're on the air.
[49:15.380 --> 49:23.380]  Hi, Alex. This is Kathy and I met you along with Gary King about a year ago. He has Patriot Radio
[49:23.380 --> 49:31.700]  in New Orleans. Gary just astonished at everything that's going on. And I help him with the research.
[49:31.700 --> 49:40.500]  And we are on fire down here. I mean, we're on the radio talk show. We put signs up. We tell
[49:40.500 --> 49:48.980]  everybody what's going on. I was able to speak to Dr. Rima Labo about a week ago. And I was actually
[49:48.980 --> 49:54.900]  asking her a person a question about how with my little granddaughter who is having learning
[49:54.900 --> 50:01.620]  difficulties and she was counseling me on the right way to eat. And I don't do don't eat any
[50:01.620 --> 50:08.740]  processed foods. The red dyes, the blue dyes, the yellow dyes in 50 plus year old studies are drugs.
[50:08.740 --> 50:12.980]  And that's what's causing most of the kids to bounce off the walls. That's why a lot of these
[50:12.980 --> 50:18.340]  dyes have been removed from the market. Just the processed sugar and dyes alone. And the mercury
[50:18.340 --> 50:23.300]  that's in half or more of the corn syrup products is what's causing it. Right. Well, what happened
[50:23.300 --> 50:29.380]  was is that what Dr. Labo medical doctor said? Yeah, yeah, she did. And at the end of the
[50:29.380 --> 50:34.900]  conversation, this was on the 15th, the ninth of the night of the 15th. I mean, I was able to talk
[50:34.900 --> 50:42.660]  to her through the Patriot Radio show. And she said, Kathy, it's too late. The kids are being
[50:42.660 --> 50:53.140]  inoculated in one and a half weeks. And Alex, I have been hysterical for the last I pray every
[50:53.140 --> 51:13.460]  day. I did stay there. That's because in your spirit, you know, they're moving against us.

[52:02.660 --> 52:08.500]  course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country. The enemy struck America
[52:08.500 --> 52:14.260]  on September 11th. But who is the enemy? Bin Laden. This is his MO. We have to look to the
[52:14.260 --> 52:19.300]  Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden. Fabled enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a
[52:19.300 --> 52:24.420]  close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States. Some U.S.
[52:24.420 --> 52:30.100]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[52:30.740 --> 52:36.340]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained. Bin Laden's connections to the CIA,
[52:36.340 --> 52:41.460]  the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[52:41.460 --> 52:46.740]  warnings and war games, the shadow government and much much more. Fabled enemies. Get the DVD
[52:46.740 --> 52:53.620]  at infowars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[52:53.620 --> 52:57.140]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[53:00.500 --> 53:04.980]  When looking at your personal preparedness level remember the freeze-drag guy. During times of
[53:04.980 --> 53:09.540]  physical and emotional stress like the uncertain times we live in today it is vital that you
[53:09.540 --> 53:14.580]  not alter your diet too much. You should only store what you usually eat because one day you may
[53:14.580 --> 53:19.300]  have to eat only what you have stored. Lucky for you there's the freeze-drag guy. Featuring the
[53:19.300 --> 53:24.180]  superior nutrition and taste you've come to expect the freeze-drag guy has a wide variety of choices
[53:24.180 --> 53:29.060]  in freeze-dried foods. All freeze-dried foods are no-cook products requiring only hot water and a
[53:29.060 --> 53:33.620]  few minutes of your time. The freeze-drag guy has been serving various government agencies as well
[53:33.620 --> 53:39.540]  as the private sector with the finest in freeze-dried storable foods and emergency rations since 1970.
[53:39.540 --> 53:43.620]  Consider the technological advances made in computers from the punch card days of the 60s
[53:43.620 --> 53:48.340]  and 70s to the high-speed personal computers of today. Comparably the advances made in food
[53:48.340 --> 53:55.300]  storage from the World War II era till now are equally great. Visit the website at www.freezdragguy.com

[54:26.020 --> 54:32.900]  Freedom ladies and gentlemen is just another word for nothing left to lose.
[54:39.300 --> 54:44.020]  And that's where I'm at in my life and I just want to defend innocent people. I want to defend
[54:44.020 --> 54:51.700]  little children. I love goodness. I love beauty. I love watching a fat squirrel sit out on a picnic
[54:51.700 --> 54:58.500]  table and eat walnuts. I just want to go live out in the country and
[55:02.260 --> 55:09.380]  just watch the clouds go by. Crank it up. But I got to tell you, we can't do that.
[55:10.020 --> 55:11.540]  We got to fight the new world order.
[55:16.580 --> 55:19.860]  When we start caring about liberty and freedom instead of sports and fashion,
[55:19.860 --> 55:28.900]  we're going to turn this society around. Let's go ahead and go back to Kathy. Kathy,
[55:28.900 --> 55:35.540]  the good news is they tried to launch a fourth inoculation, a smallpox. In 2002-2003 it failed.
[55:36.180 --> 55:42.500]  99.9% according to the LA Times refused it, a 14 million first responders. They're trying it again
[55:43.780 --> 55:48.420]  and I pray it's going to fail. It looks like the hoax is faltering but it looks like they're still
[55:48.420 --> 55:53.860]  going ahead with it. But the momentum and the resistance is mounting. So yes, I am
[55:54.660 --> 55:59.940]  on the edge of my seat. I can't even sleep. I mean, I got home last night at two in the morning
[56:00.740 --> 56:04.980]  working on Fall the Republic, finishing it, finishing a few finding, a few articles were
[56:04.980 --> 56:14.980]  adding a few pieces of music were smoothing out and I got in bed and the baby didn't feel good.
[56:14.980 --> 56:19.060]  So I got up to care of the baby some, which was fine because I wasn't even couldn't sleep.
[56:19.060 --> 56:23.060]  And then I rolled around all night and watched the sun come up out the window.
[56:25.620 --> 56:32.020]  And I just can't believe the decision humanities made collectively to be enslaved
[56:32.020 --> 56:35.700]  and to be exterminated and to let a hitlerian system take over.
[56:37.140 --> 56:40.980]  And all you fools out there that make jokes about this stuff and laugh about it,
[56:40.980 --> 56:45.460]  I wish you knew the truth because if you knew what I knew, you wouldn't be laughing. I'll assure you
[56:45.460 --> 56:51.380]  with that. If you knew what I knew, you wouldn't be giggling and snickering about this. I will assure
[56:51.380 --> 56:58.340]  you because it takes every bit of manhood and honor and strength I've got not to take my family
[56:58.340 --> 57:02.260]  and haul ass out of this country to some third world place in the middle of nowhere.
[57:03.140 --> 57:07.140]  It takes every bit of will I've got not to follow my instincts and haul ass.
[57:07.140 --> 57:12.100]  Every time I look at my children, finishing up with Kathy in New Orleans. Kathy?
[57:12.740 --> 57:19.860]  What I do is I tell everybody get a box of food, get water, have a plan, a hiding place.
[57:19.860 --> 57:26.420]  And they think I'm crazy. My daughter with my beautiful little granddaughter. She thinks I'm
[57:26.420 --> 57:32.740]  crazy, Alex. We saw soldiers in full gear driving up and down Canal Street yesterday.
[57:32.740 --> 57:39.060]  I, I go around and I tell people in the grocery store, God told me to tell you this. I go in
[57:39.060 --> 57:46.100]  the bank. God told me to tell you this. I mean, I feel sick and I mean, I have a rash. I'm so
[57:46.740 --> 57:54.180]  like, I'm so on edge. I'm, I'm, I'm trying. Kathy, Kathy, give it, give it to God. Just
[57:54.180 --> 57:58.660]  just say, God, I'm going to do my best job I can. And I know that's not enough, but you, you're
[57:58.660 --> 58:02.820]  going to take me the rest of the way. It's just like jumping from one cliff to another. You know,
[58:02.820 --> 58:07.380]  you can't make it. You're going to ask God to get you across and just turn it over to God. But know
[58:07.380 --> 58:13.380]  this, they may not even launch the big one this time. And then next time people won't take it
[58:13.380 --> 58:18.740]  serious. When we warn them, this is psychological warfare. This is done by design. I understand
[58:18.740 --> 58:23.300]  how you're feeling. I'm the same way. And I've just got a, during the last break, I had to just
[58:23.300 --> 58:28.820]  say to God, I'm giving it to you. It's in your hands. I'm going to be a good person. I'm going to
[58:28.820 --> 58:34.260]  tell the truth. I'm going to be as honorable as I possibly can in this fleshly body. And it's up
[58:34.260 --> 58:38.260]  to you. I'm doing what the boss upstairs has to say. And that's the end of it.
[58:38.260 --> 58:54.660]  Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones. And I want each of you to ask yourself this question. Do you
[58:54.660 --> 58:59.540]  really know what's in your tap water? In a recent study conducted by a major environmental
[58:59.540 --> 59:04.420]  auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking
[59:04.420 --> 59:09.300]  water. Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental
[59:09.300 --> 59:14.180]  system diseases. Now, what are you going to do about it? The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water
[59:14.180 --> 59:19.380]  Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water. The Acola
[59:19.380 --> 59:24.820]  Blue 28 produces up to seven gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art
[59:24.820 --> 59:30.660]  carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques. That's right.

[1:00:08.580 --> 1:00:17.140]  Cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network,
[1:00:17.140 --> 1:00:40.660]  and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. Ladies and gentlemen, we are now into the second
[1:00:40.660 --> 1:00:44.660]  hour. We're taking your calls for the next 30 minutes. Dr. Leonard Horowitz joins us for a full
[1:00:44.660 --> 1:00:54.100]  hour with massive breaking news, and I've got some really bad news for you, but also interesting news
[1:00:54.100 --> 1:01:01.540]  that it's out. Jason Burma's two weeks ago showed me the healthcare bill. I didn't go check the U.S.
[1:01:01.540 --> 1:01:07.940]  Code. The way it read was these Class II implantable devices like RFID. I didn't go look at the code
[1:01:07.940 --> 1:01:15.540]  that it linked to because I was too busy, but now it's come out on thestreetinsider.com that Jason
[1:01:15.540 --> 1:01:19.620]  was correct. I wasn't saying he was wrong. It's one of the hundreds of things a week I see that are
[1:01:19.620 --> 1:01:24.980]  huge that I don't even alert on. I'm like a bird dog that has hundreds of quail flying up in front
[1:01:24.980 --> 1:01:30.820]  of it. So many targets that I can't even keep track of at her point. I'm constantly pointing.
[1:01:32.020 --> 1:01:37.620]  For those that don't know about bird hunting, the dog points. It puts one leg up and straightens out
[1:01:37.620 --> 1:01:43.540]  and points where the birds are at. I'm like a baseball player, a hitter in a batting cage,
[1:01:43.540 --> 1:01:49.780]  and they got 15 batting machines, 15 pitching machines set up, shooting balls at me so fast,
[1:01:49.780 --> 1:01:56.500]  I can't even keep track of them. But here it is, Vera Chip, granted exclusive license for patients
[1:01:56.500 --> 1:02:05.380]  use in virus triage detection system in H1N1 virus. That means implantable chips to prove you've
[1:02:05.380 --> 1:02:09.780]  had the shot or you haven't had the shot and they will triage you deciding they're not going to treat
[1:02:09.780 --> 1:02:14.740]  you. That's what triage means. It means they'll decide who to treat, not to treat, who to let
[1:02:14.740 --> 1:02:20.180]  die, who to not let die, who to lock up in a room to die. This is off the charts. Again, I just,
[1:02:21.060 --> 1:02:25.780]  these people are out of control. Do you understand the people that funded Hitler, Stalin, and Mao
[1:02:25.780 --> 1:02:33.540]  are now in control? They fund communism, fascism, socialism. I'm going to cover this more in the
[1:02:33.540 --> 1:02:36.820]  next segment. Let's go to another phone call. Joe in PA, you're on the air.
[1:02:37.940 --> 1:02:43.860]  Hey, I was just, I had another bowl coming at you about 90 miles an hour here. I'm in Pittsburgh
[1:02:43.860 --> 1:02:50.660]  here and we're just a few days from the G20 summit. And as promised by our local embassy
[1:02:50.660 --> 1:02:56.900]  affiliate a couple of weeks ago, our active duty military on the streets in downtown.
[1:02:56.900 --> 1:03:00.740]  Yes, and I need, I saw that in the Pittsburgh Post Gazette. We need to get somebody on the
[1:03:00.740 --> 1:03:05.460]  next few days in the Pittsburgh Post Gazette or any other paper or any blog. They admit
[1:03:05.460 --> 1:03:10.580]  special police powers issued regular Homeland Security brigade troops. And anytime there's
[1:03:10.580 --> 1:03:16.740]  a fortune 500 G 20 G eight presidential meeting, they now use that as a federalization drill.
[1:03:17.700 --> 1:03:21.940]  So the locals stand down and let the feds take over. They're using the flu as a cover drill.
[1:03:22.980 --> 1:03:27.860]  All of this just like Delta force admitted in the late nineties, early 2000s,
[1:03:27.860 --> 1:03:33.780]  all their urban warfare drills were done to acclimate the locals. So tell me about the troops.
[1:03:33.780 --> 1:03:41.860]  What'd you see? Well, we have camo, military, um, v parked in different areas downtown.
[1:03:41.860 --> 1:03:47.700]  There are these white vans. Some of them are budget renavans, but in the back army intelligence,
[1:03:47.700 --> 1:03:54.100]  you know, yeah, you see, you see the National Guard and their, their full gear sitting in the
[1:03:54.100 --> 1:04:00.740]  back other places you see them standing outside. There are our cops. We're not for terrorists.
[1:04:00.740 --> 1:04:08.420]  This is for the American people and brigade homeland admits that we have patchy helicopters
[1:04:08.420 --> 1:04:14.980]  hovering right over the buildings downtown. Uh, there was a C 130 that I saw fly by about an hour
[1:04:14.980 --> 1:04:21.540]  ago. Can you get, do you have a video camera? Can you put it on YouTube? Yes, we're, we're on that.
[1:04:21.540 --> 1:04:29.540]  We have troops walking around with the canines through the outskirts of the city.
[1:04:31.780 --> 1:04:36.660]  We are in the process of video. You are under martial law. We're all under martial law.
[1:04:36.660 --> 1:04:41.940]  They're now acclimating the slaves for the total grid. God help us. Ladies and gentlemen,
[1:04:41.940 --> 1:04:46.580]  the average moron sucking their thumb, watching sports has no idea their waters being poisoned.
[1:04:46.580 --> 1:04:50.340]  They're openly announcing eugenics to kill the old people in Newsweek.
[1:04:50.340 --> 1:04:54.900]  Hell is being incrementally released. So the public becomes acclimated and accepts it.
[1:04:54.900 --> 1:04:59.780]  Stay there, Joe. Continue your report on the other side info wars.com.
[1:04:59.780 --> 1:05:04.980]  Global transmission created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you
[1:05:04.980 --> 1:05:09.300]  to eat. Will you continue to be their profit center buying their processed food that makes
[1:05:09.300 --> 1:05:15.060]  you sick? Go to the doctor and buy their drugs. You don't have to cooperate. There is a solution.

[1:06:11.540 --> 1:06:16.100]  These emergency backup systems provide life saving electrical power when you need it most.
[1:06:16.100 --> 1:06:21.460]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity
[1:06:21.460 --> 1:06:26.100]  for free. It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home. Run

[1:08:24.340 --> 1:08:30.980]  The New World Order is launching economic implosions worldwide to consolidate power
[1:08:30.980 --> 1:08:37.060]  vertically, vertical integration. They are using the flu pandemic as a global pretext under
[1:08:37.060 --> 1:08:43.540]  World Health Organization UN rules to bring every major nation under UN control. Domestically,
[1:08:43.540 --> 1:08:47.700]  the federal government is ordering police to take blood without warrants at checkpoints.
[1:08:50.260 --> 1:08:57.060]  They have announced for the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania G-20 as the 20 banking heads of the world
[1:08:57.060 --> 1:09:02.980]  meet for open martial law, total police state, free speech zones, locking down where you can
[1:09:02.980 --> 1:09:09.060]  protest. And yes, we've confirmed regular army is on the streets there. Calling into the show,
[1:09:09.060 --> 1:09:13.220]  Joe in Pennsylvania, I was interrupting you in the last segment. Give me a report on what you're
[1:09:13.220 --> 1:09:21.220]  seeing, what the local news is saying. This is pretty mum on the subject except for a couple
[1:09:21.220 --> 1:09:30.180]  of reports in the last couple of weeks. Speak up for me. They said initially that there was going
[1:09:30.180 --> 1:09:36.740]  to be a shortage of police officers, so the governor and the mayor put out a call to other
[1:09:36.740 --> 1:09:43.700]  departments to supplement our 900 officers here in Pittsburgh. And now, they're saying that they
[1:09:43.700 --> 1:09:51.780]  have 4,000 confirmed officers, and initially, they would have the National Guard on call
[1:09:52.500 --> 1:09:57.780]  at the governor's back in call if we needed them. And initially, it was supposed to be
[1:09:57.780 --> 1:10:03.300]  1,500 troops on call, and that has changed to 2,000 troops, which are here.
[1:10:05.540 --> 1:10:10.900]  And so, I should be in Pittsburgh filming all of that, and I don't have the funds of the personnel,
[1:10:12.900 --> 1:10:21.940]  but when does it officially start? Thursday and Friday, 24th and 25th.
[1:10:21.940 --> 1:10:29.140]  Let's just do this now. Will you call Rob doing here, please? I'm going to have to,
[1:10:29.140 --> 1:10:34.740]  I'm finishing in the next two days, follow the Republic, and I think I'm going to send a crew
[1:10:36.260 --> 1:10:41.300]  up there. But it's coming to all the towns and cities, and it was the same thing in
[1:10:42.260 --> 1:10:47.140]  Schenactady, New York, a month and a half ago, the city council announced they have a shortage
[1:10:47.140 --> 1:10:52.100]  of police, so, quote, they want martial law and the army there, and it turns out that we found
[1:10:52.100 --> 1:10:57.540]  a bunch of, quote, mayors, part of the special council of mayors that supports Obama. They're
[1:10:57.540 --> 1:11:01.460]  all calling for troops to be put in their cities, quote, for police shortages, and then in Arkansas,
[1:11:01.460 --> 1:11:06.180]  they're announcing all these different towns have daytime curfews and checkpoint stop and search
[1:11:06.180 --> 1:11:12.340]  everyone. This is just total hell being released. Let's turn dues, Mike on. Rob,
[1:11:12.340 --> 1:11:18.260]  again, something else on the radar I saw last week, a few blurbs about National Guard and
[1:11:18.260 --> 1:11:23.780]  Regular Army under Northcom. Joe and PA was saying 2,000 troops are now on the streets
[1:11:23.780 --> 1:11:30.260]  all over the city with police dogs and helicopters. Do you, because you've now done a great job on
[1:11:30.260 --> 1:11:36.500]  follow the Republic with editing and capturing and logging video, do you want to be dispatched?
[1:11:36.500 --> 1:11:45.140]  We'd send Craig, but he's got a wisdom tooth issue. Do you want to go with Douglas? Do you want to
[1:11:45.860 --> 1:11:51.860]  be part of the rebel probe droid and be fired to Pennsylvania? We can do that. Actually, I lived
[1:11:51.860 --> 1:11:57.700]  there for 10 years, so I know that area. I lived outside of Pittsburgh, so I know that area pretty
[1:11:57.700 --> 1:12:08.180]  well. Okay, it starts Thursday. How about, it's a two day meeting, correct, Joe? Yes, sir. So it
[1:12:08.180 --> 1:12:12.260]  runs Thursday, Friday, and then they have private meetings on Saturday. The real meetings will go
[1:12:12.260 --> 1:12:15.540]  on Saturday. They'll have a public event and they're going to have a close one Saturday if they
[1:12:15.540 --> 1:12:21.220]  follow their criminal paradigm, their criminal MO, modus operandi. Then I'm going to go ahead,
[1:12:21.220 --> 1:12:25.620]  let's send you Wednesday morning. Okay. And then let's have you come back Saturday night. Is your
[1:12:25.620 --> 1:12:32.100]  wife game for that? Yeah, it should be a problem. Get the tickets, launch operation to go get the
[1:12:32.100 --> 1:12:39.060]  video of this. And no doubt, you're going to see military searching citizens, stay back within
[1:12:39.060 --> 1:12:43.860]  50 yards of them. But at the same time, well, you know this, but we're doing this for everybody
[1:12:43.860 --> 1:12:46.900]  else listening. What I've learned over the years, something I'm some expert, well, I guess I kind
[1:12:46.900 --> 1:12:52.660]  of am an expert at dealing with the military domestically. Just act like, I like the Hawaiian
[1:12:52.660 --> 1:13:00.660]  shirts. You know, that's a good camo for the info war, just bumble about. And if they come over,
[1:13:00.660 --> 1:13:05.540]  just act completely stupid and vacant and literally just image McDonald's and pro football in your
[1:13:05.540 --> 1:13:11.380]  mind, transmit that at a psychic level. If the troops come over. And of course, you know what
[1:13:11.380 --> 1:13:20.580]  else to do. Like I said, don't split up, right? And just get out there and get the operation
[1:13:20.580 --> 1:13:28.100]  going. Get all the video you can, my friend. This is going to be amazing, but hit the ground.
[1:13:28.100 --> 1:13:33.540]  In fact, maybe she even leave Tuesday night because perhaps you should hook up with Joe. Joe,
[1:13:33.540 --> 1:13:37.220]  where are the main areas that you physically are seeing the Humvees and the police dogs and the
[1:13:37.220 --> 1:13:45.060]  searching? Well, it's in the downtown area, which is very compact and it's in the shape of a triangle
[1:13:45.060 --> 1:13:51.300]  surrounded by rivers. So they have it pretty well cordoned off or they will for the summit.
[1:13:53.620 --> 1:14:02.820]  And recap what you've seen. We've seen both regular Apache helicopters in the,
[1:14:02.820 --> 1:14:11.140]  in the camouflage colors. We've seen black helicopters, C 130s. There are military sitting
[1:14:11.140 --> 1:14:17.300]  in vans all around the city. These white vans. There are police and military walking together
[1:14:17.300 --> 1:14:25.940]  with with the German shepherd dogs parking in everybody. Total acclamation. Yeah, exactly.
[1:14:28.340 --> 1:14:33.940]  And they're merging the police and military right in front of everybody. Do we probably need to get
[1:14:33.940 --> 1:14:39.780]  your name and number just so we have a liaison there, Joe, or so we can hook up with you.
[1:14:39.780 --> 1:14:44.500]  And maybe if you've got some good footage, you might want to share that with us. But regardless,
[1:14:44.500 --> 1:14:50.740]  this is very important. Obviously, stay out of the protest. You're, you're, you're with
[1:14:52.340 --> 1:14:58.900]  free speech systems, channel 10, Austin, where we do the show. And we've got some old infowars,
[1:14:58.900 --> 1:15:03.860]  press passes, nothing you need to be on the street, but just, just you're there covering this for
[1:15:03.860 --> 1:15:11.220]  TV news, which we are. And the force be with you, dude. Yeah. So that's tomorrow night,
[1:15:11.220 --> 1:15:17.140]  I guess we'll be taking off. Yep. Anything else you need to add, Joe? Well, we, we did just sort
[1:15:17.140 --> 1:15:22.740]  of, we were changed Pittsburgh chapter last week. And we've already got members from Ohio and I
[1:15:22.740 --> 1:15:28.740]  believe Minnesota, as well as Luke Rudelsky, you're supposed to hook up with us to go down there.
[1:15:28.740 --> 1:15:32.660]  Remember the drill in Iowa six months ago, we had the Colonel on where they were doing gun
[1:15:32.660 --> 1:15:36.580]  confiscation drills door to door, practicing locking down Arcadia. I mean, this is really
[1:15:36.580 --> 1:15:41.460]  happening. That's why everybody instinctively is out buying record amounts of firearms for the last
[1:15:42.340 --> 1:15:47.380]  12 months straight. Because people know folks and I, I can't believe Northcom is going to try
[1:15:47.380 --> 1:15:51.940]  this, but they're just slowly acclimating. It's mainly to brainwash the troops and police that
[1:15:51.940 --> 1:15:58.020]  working together is normal. Okay, Joe, we're going to get your name and number right now. Is there a
[1:15:58.020 --> 1:16:04.900]  We Are Changed chapter website you want to give us in Pennsylvania? We are change.org slash Pittsburgh.
[1:16:06.260 --> 1:16:09.460]  All right, brother, take care. We'll get your name and number right now. John Harmon,
[1:16:09.460 --> 1:16:14.580]  please get that. Dude, what do you think about this mission? I'm ready. This is going to be a
[1:16:14.580 --> 1:16:20.020]  big one. I think this is, I think they're going to openly announce the new currency right after
[1:16:20.020 --> 1:16:23.620]  you're going to get best footage, say going in a subway shop, sitting there eating a sandwich
[1:16:23.620 --> 1:16:28.260]  while the troops go by. Right, right. And just remember you've done nothing wrong because in
[1:16:28.260 --> 1:16:32.500]  the psychological system, when you submit and grovel, I know you're not going to do this,
[1:16:32.500 --> 1:16:37.300]  it's almost like it's an affirmation that their oppression is good. So when the troops walk over
[1:16:37.300 --> 1:16:43.540]  as I had happened in New York, that's in the end game, they run over with sidearms and scream,
[1:16:43.540 --> 1:16:48.340]  turn that effing camera off. And I said, no, this is America. I'll do what I want. Now,
[1:16:48.340 --> 1:16:52.180]  I don't suggest you do that getting in the guy's face. And then his officers come over and they
[1:16:52.180 --> 1:16:57.700]  drug him away and they got in white vans and drove off angrily. I don't suggest you do that. I just
[1:16:57.700 --> 1:17:02.180]  got really mad when the guy came from like 20 feet away screaming at me. And then they come up
[1:17:02.180 --> 1:17:08.020]  and just say, first amendment, sir, what, what's wrong, bro? We're just here covering this for
[1:17:08.020 --> 1:17:13.300]  the news, covering the G 20. I mean, it's a balance. It's a tight rope because if you were to submit,
[1:17:13.300 --> 1:17:17.540]  they may start beating you, shooting you. I mean, literally the police may come over taser you
[1:17:17.540 --> 1:17:21.620]  when you're on your back, they'll bend down, stick a 45 in your back, pump rounds into you and
[1:17:21.620 --> 1:17:25.940]  say a terrorist was killed. We're seeing these reports every few days where people run from
[1:17:25.940 --> 1:17:29.620]  the police and they just kill you now. The Chicago police announced three months ago. They're doing
[1:17:29.620 --> 1:17:35.300]  that. So I'm not trying to, I'm just telling you that, uh, that, uh, you're looking forward to this.
[1:17:36.020 --> 1:17:41.060]  Well, now that you've said that now, I'm good. I'm good to go. Well, no, I'm letting you know the
[1:17:41.060 --> 1:17:45.780]  potential because it's like an attack dog. What happens if you run from a pit bull, right? They
[1:17:45.780 --> 1:17:52.260]  smell fear and they, but at the same time, I tend to scream in their face. Uh, and that really
[1:17:52.260 --> 1:17:56.740]  backs them off, but it, but it, but it, but it doesn't work if it isn't real. I'm genuinely mad.
[1:17:56.740 --> 1:18:01.140]  The troops are urinating all over the constitution and my family, when they get in my face on the
[1:18:01.140 --> 1:18:05.620]  streets of America, like punk thug pieces of trash, pieces of garbage, enemy, Soviet, communist,
[1:18:05.620 --> 1:18:09.940]  Nazi forces, but I don't suggest you that just the calm, nice. I think you're going to do great.
[1:18:09.940 --> 1:18:14.660]  I mean, literally it's 5% chance they'll arrest you or beat you up. I just upfront want you to
[1:18:14.660 --> 1:18:20.260]  know the mission you're accepting. I'll use some of that surfers in on them. Turn it back on them.
[1:18:20.260 --> 1:18:23.940]  Yeah, we'll be, I'll be fine. I'm not too worried, but I'll get good footage. I think
[1:18:23.940 --> 1:18:30.260]  is that a point? Brank analogy was that? No, that was something that you said to me. What time?
[1:18:30.260 --> 1:18:35.300]  What'd I say? Said something about the, uh, the sir, you know, it's not always in and surfing.
[1:18:35.300 --> 1:18:39.780]  And, you know, I don't know. I guess I give off that allure. So I'll just use that against them.
[1:18:39.780 --> 1:18:45.380]  That's good. Yeah. I'll be, I'll be calm, cool and collected. And, and I know Pittsburgh,
[1:18:45.380 --> 1:18:50.820]  so I can throw in a Pittsburgh accent if I need to ins guys want to go down to the sub shop.
[1:18:53.300 --> 1:18:58.260]  You enemy of America. All right. I'm going to go book these tickets. All right. But listen,
[1:18:58.260 --> 1:19:02.420]  John Harmon, did you get his name and number, uh, Joe's to give it to, uh, dude? Yeah, I am
[1:19:02.420 --> 1:19:06.980]  John. I'm, I am you, John. Oh man. I wish the mindless public was aware of what's going on.
[1:19:06.980 --> 1:19:13.700]  It's just like the twilight zone. I mean, you've got all these idiots out there who have no idea
[1:19:13.700 --> 1:19:18.260]  what's coming down on them. They have no idea what's going on. I mean, this country has been
[1:19:18.260 --> 1:19:23.700]  completely bankrupted by design, 23.7 trillion in the last 10, 11 months. We haven't gotten new
[1:19:23.700 --> 1:19:28.820]  numbers the last two months. So it's more than 23.7 trillion, but we'll just use the last number.
[1:19:28.820 --> 1:19:33.860]  23.7 trillion is gone. They're going for broke. They've committed so many crimes out in the open.
[1:19:33.860 --> 1:19:37.700]  This is not a drill. This is not a game. This is not a joke. This is it.
[1:19:39.060 --> 1:19:43.620]  And they are just going to continue to ratchet things up. They have decided to go with a hot
[1:19:43.620 --> 1:19:49.620]  new world order. They decided to pull out every stage crises, every false flag and God help us.
[1:19:49.620 --> 1:19:54.340]  And I want the military and police to know you are destroying your own future, participating
[1:19:54.340 --> 1:19:58.820]  in this. You're being brainwashed along with the public to go along with the next big takeover.
[1:19:58.820 --> 1:20:06.100]  Attention, landscapers, house painters, carpet cleaners, pet sitters, gutter cleaners, and anyone

[1:21:03.460 --> 1:21:09.780]  humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've got to give them a stake in creating the
[1:21:09.780 --> 1:21:15.940]  kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see. The Obama deception completely destroys
[1:21:15.940 --> 1:21:20.740]  the myth that Obama is working for the best interests of the American people. Well, Obama's
[1:21:20.740 --> 1:21:26.420]  already fudging, fudged since day one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical
[1:21:26.420 --> 1:21:32.260]  mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme
[1:21:32.260 --> 1:21:39.620]  bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism. It's not about left or right. It's about a
[1:21:39.620 --> 1:21:45.460]  one-world government. This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told,
[1:21:45.460 --> 1:21:53.140]  and his real agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception today at info wars dot com or download
[1:21:53.140 --> 1:21:59.060]  it in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv. The Obama deception. The people strike back.
[1:22:00.740 --> 1:22:05.060]  There are many guarantees in this world. The closest I can come to a guarantee is that the
[1:22:05.060 --> 1:22:09.540]  dollar is going to zero. During the great hyperinflation in Weimar Germany, people who had
[1:22:09.540 --> 1:22:14.180]  worked all their lives invested conservatively were wiped out, reduced to poverty. There are
[1:22:14.180 --> 1:22:18.820]  many parallels between the Weimar and the U.S. today. I'll send you a list. There are ways to
[1:22:18.820 --> 1:22:24.100]  protect yourself from hyperinflation, gold and silver, and legal and constitutional ways to
[1:22:24.100 --> 1:22:29.460]  avoid confiscation, which is becoming highly probable. I'm Bob Moss with Midas Resources.
[1:22:29.460 --> 1:22:33.700]  Many of the people I talked to today are aware of trouble coming but haven't taken action to
[1:22:33.700 --> 1:22:38.740]  protect themselves. There is in fact a financial tsunami coming and it could fall upon us quickly
[1:22:38.740 --> 1:22:46.420]  with little warning. Help procrastinate protect yourself. Call me today. Bob Moss at 800-686-2237

[1:24:07.460 --> 1:24:13.540]  You unlock this door with the key of imagination. Beyond it is another dimension, a dimension of
[1:24:13.540 --> 1:24:21.540]  sound, a dimension of sight, a dimension of mind. You're moving into a land of both shadow and
[1:24:21.540 --> 1:24:26.900]  substance of things and ideas. You've just crossed over into the Twilight Zone.
[1:24:31.220 --> 1:24:35.780]  You've just passed over into the New World Order Police State Control Grid Zone.
[1:24:37.700 --> 1:24:41.620]  Everywhere you're being trained to go under military control, they're openly announcing
[1:24:41.620 --> 1:24:47.380]  379,000 troops to oppress you and your family, warrantless blood checkpoints,
[1:24:47.380 --> 1:24:52.820]  just hellish control being released, $15 million fines for garage sales if you're selling any
[1:24:52.820 --> 1:24:58.260]  recalled products. Don't even know you are. Newspapers and magazines are promoting one-shot
[1:24:58.260 --> 1:25:03.380]  policy and killing old people, like Newsweek, the case for killing Granny. Yeah, we've crossed
[1:25:03.380 --> 1:25:09.140]  over into the tyranny zone and they're testing us, they're pushing us. They take two steps,
[1:25:09.140 --> 1:25:13.780]  we push them back a step. They take three steps, we push them back two steps. They take ten steps,
[1:25:13.780 --> 1:25:18.020]  we push them back five steps. They take twenty steps, we push them back fourteen steps. They
[1:25:18.020 --> 1:25:22.340]  take a hundred steps, we push them back thirty-five steps. They take a thousand steps, we push them
[1:25:22.340 --> 1:25:28.660]  back six hundred steps. They are winning, but each time we're pushing them back more than we
[1:25:28.660 --> 1:25:35.060]  did before. And as soon as we realize we can win the fight, it's over. Every phone call to
[1:25:35.060 --> 1:25:45.380]  chert off on C-SPAN, every phone call saying 9-11's an inside job. Military veterans calling and
[1:25:45.380 --> 1:25:49.220]  knowing about Able Danger, knowing about the commission, remember saying it's a fraud. Their
[1:25:49.860 --> 1:25:57.300]  takeover, their stage terror is collapsing. And so they, like a bully, are going to gut up and
[1:25:57.300 --> 1:26:01.060]  move that much harder. And the average military that's going to be out there are just ignorant,
[1:26:01.060 --> 1:26:08.100]  just like the American people. They're not bad folks. The police aren't bad, but they're ignorant
[1:26:08.100 --> 1:26:11.940]  and stupid and dumbed down just like everybody else. They're in a trance, they're mesmerized,
[1:26:11.940 --> 1:26:17.940]  they're hypnotized. The average person watches four and a half hours of TV, the average young
[1:26:17.940 --> 1:26:22.820]  person over five hours of TV, two hours of video games, completely plugged into the matrix. They're
[1:26:22.820 --> 1:26:32.820]  in an alpha state. They are mesmerized scientifically. I mean, it shows it on the meters.
[1:26:35.380 --> 1:26:40.900]  It shows it when they do the brainwave studies. So the public is believing TV is the real world
[1:26:40.900 --> 1:26:45.540]  and entertainment and everything's fine. Everything is curves like commercials and
[1:26:45.540 --> 1:26:53.620]  bikini girls and dancing with the stars. It isn't. All around us in the real world, hard,
[1:26:53.620 --> 1:27:00.340]  core, vicious tyranny is being set up. And I'll say it again, 99.9% of us are in the same boat.
[1:27:00.340 --> 1:27:03.940]  If you're an FBI agent, if you're a military person, if you're a cop, if you're a government
[1:27:03.940 --> 1:27:08.340]  bureaucrat, you are going to lose your standard of living. You're having your water poisoned.
[1:27:08.340 --> 1:27:16.180]  Please look into eugenics. Please, please, please, please. I told you all this was coming and now
[1:27:16.180 --> 1:27:21.620]  it's intensifying. It's real. I wish I was wrong. I wish the new world order wasn't real.
[1:27:25.380 --> 1:27:27.940]  I wish the global system wasn't coming down on us.
[1:27:27.940 --> 1:27:41.380]  So much is happening. So much is going on. So much is developing. So much is unfolding.
[1:27:43.700 --> 1:27:47.220]  And coming up is Dr. Horowitz.
[1:27:51.220 --> 1:27:57.060]  And I'm in the process of hiring more cameraman, more web people. We've hired another video editor.
[1:27:57.060 --> 1:28:02.020]  He's doing a great job, Mike. We're trying to beef up here in the face of this. That's why
[1:28:02.020 --> 1:28:07.220]  the show gets so intense and so focused. I don't even plug what funds this operation,
[1:28:07.220 --> 1:28:11.620]  the powerful documentary films, 24 of them I've made, the latest, the Obama deception,
[1:28:11.620 --> 1:28:16.420]  all the other great videos I consult on and am in. I camp FEMA now shipping out,
[1:28:16.420 --> 1:28:20.980]  showing the whole Homeland Security martial law plan, the takeover grid, the FEMA camps,
[1:28:20.980 --> 1:28:25.140]  the bills, the documents, the video. I consulted on the film. I'm one of the main people featured
[1:28:25.140 --> 1:28:32.580]  in it. It's available right now at infowards.com. Or you can call toll free to get camp FEMA,

[1:30:04.820 --> 1:30:10.260]  battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be
[1:30:10.260 --> 1:30:16.260]  all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition.
[1:30:16.260 --> 1:30:21.540]  How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it?
[1:30:21.540 --> 1:30:26.180]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children
[1:30:26.180 --> 1:30:30.820]  sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[1:30:30.820 --> 1:30:36.260]  and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply. Food is your
[1:30:36.260 --> 1:30:41.460]  ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know.
[1:30:41.460 --> 1:30:46.500]  How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live to

[1:33:26.260 --> 1:33:34.260]  give me no talking. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, for the next hour we are joined by Dr. Lynn
[1:33:34.260 --> 1:33:43.700]  Horowitz, Harvard educated, and I have his detailed, lengthy affidavit linked up on infowars.com
[1:33:43.700 --> 1:33:49.860]  and prismplanet.com, the fluescam.com, his website. Affidavit of Leonard G. Horowitz,
[1:33:51.380 --> 1:33:58.260]  he's filed this with the FBI. Now, he's only done this one other time that I know of
[1:33:58.260 --> 1:34:05.300]  months before 9-11 and then right after 9-11 he came out and he said they're going to launch an
[1:34:05.300 --> 1:34:12.420]  anthrax attack through the mail because he noticed that they'd done a congressional study of mailing
[1:34:12.420 --> 1:34:16.740]  weaponized anthrax through the mail in the year before 9-11. He had some other pieces of evidence.
[1:34:16.740 --> 1:34:21.860]  He filed that as affidavit. They ignored it for six months. Then it was in the news that they
[1:34:21.860 --> 1:34:26.100]  showed up at his house saying he was a suspect because how could he know this was going to happen
[1:34:26.100 --> 1:34:32.180]  through the mail? And of course, no laboratories, no nothing, no proof. Later they tried to pin it
[1:34:32.180 --> 1:34:36.980]  on a couple people. Turned out it was super weaponized, like he said. They tried to burn patsies.
[1:34:38.100 --> 1:34:42.100]  Are they going to try to say now he's behind the flue as it comes out it's weaponized?
[1:34:43.140 --> 1:34:47.380]  So that's how close to these issues he is. That's how informed he is.
[1:34:49.140 --> 1:34:54.500]  And he makes that point in his affidavit. Last time I contacted the FBI, I warned them about the
[1:34:54.500 --> 1:34:58.020]  impending anthrax attacks. One week before the first mailings were announced to the president or
[1:34:58.020 --> 1:35:03.380]  horror was recalled. It took them six months to respond. When they did, they made me a suspect
[1:35:03.380 --> 1:35:07.780]  in the mailings. This time I'm writing of the Justice Department a month before the deadliest
[1:35:07.780 --> 1:35:15.220]  genocide in history. I'm praying they'll take kindly to my appeal to investigate PNYC and
[1:35:15.220 --> 1:35:21.300]  court ordered injunction to stop vaccinations for public protection. Now, I feel bad because I'm
[1:35:21.300 --> 1:35:25.060]  so focused on making fall the republic. I'm so focused on those other issues that Dr. Horowitz
[1:35:25.060 --> 1:35:28.180]  has been trying to go to hold me for a week and a half. That's how busy I've been with the whole
[1:35:28.180 --> 1:35:34.660]  Charlie Sheen 9 11 operation exposing that we've launched every phone call last week to Michael
[1:35:34.660 --> 1:35:39.540]  Chertoff on C spam was saying it was an inside job. Totally the whole coverups imploding there,
[1:35:39.540 --> 1:35:43.380]  but I apologize. Dr Horowitz and I'm very honored that he tried to reach out to us first for this.
[1:35:43.380 --> 1:35:47.780]  I'm going to have to give you my personal cell doc. I'm sorry, but I said in the first hour,
[1:35:47.780 --> 1:35:52.740]  this is the bravest thing I've ever seen what you're doing because I know you go through
[1:35:52.740 --> 1:35:58.900]  tremendous hell to do something like this and to lay out this detailed scientific affidavit
[1:35:58.900 --> 1:36:04.660]  that it doesn't have page numbers. What is it? It's like 45 50 pages long when we printed it out.
[1:36:05.540 --> 1:36:10.820]  And I just salute your courage. It's this type of maverick courage and this type of piercing
[1:36:10.820 --> 1:36:15.540]  discernment and understanding that may save humanity. And I have no doubt the creators working
[1:36:15.540 --> 1:36:20.500]  through you. Dr Horowitz and we're all praying for you right now, sir and your team. Well,
[1:36:20.500 --> 1:36:25.300]  thank you so much. Love you what you do and love you and greatly appreciate what you're doing
[1:36:25.860 --> 1:36:32.100]  and have been doing. And I think that it's time that we come together as a family to simply stop
[1:36:32.100 --> 1:36:37.460]  the genocide, stop the insanity, the hypocrisy, this lunacy that's operating under the guise of
[1:36:37.460 --> 1:36:42.500]  public health and national security. And I think we're starting to win. I'm telling you because
[1:36:42.500 --> 1:36:48.020]  the doctors out there who are wise, they are not going to take the flu vaccines and they're not
[1:36:48.020 --> 1:36:52.500]  going to give it to their patients. And I think what we're going to start together and continue
[1:36:52.500 --> 1:36:57.700]  together is a whole evolution and consciousness towards what true health care reform should
[1:36:57.700 --> 1:37:04.100]  reflect, not this poisoning of the population. Okay, sir, I want to start before we get to the
[1:37:04.100 --> 1:37:08.020]  new bombshell info and new developments. You're saying you're going to come out Wednesday. I hope
[1:37:08.020 --> 1:37:13.540]  we can break that here. You told me you've sent me the info. It's now in my email. But as much as
[1:37:13.540 --> 1:37:19.700]  you can tell us about that today, what's coming up on Wednesday. But first, let's walk through the
[1:37:19.700 --> 1:37:29.300]  anthrax detailed, precise prediction that you made on public record. What's currently happening with
[1:37:29.300 --> 1:37:36.100]  the current H1N1 vaccine, the virus itself where that's going. And then now you're affidavit and
[1:37:36.100 --> 1:37:41.620]  the bombshell info and then the new info that's coming out. Well, you know, I think the title
[1:37:41.620 --> 1:37:49.060]  of info wars and info wars.com really says it all. My area of expertise, primarily besides,
[1:37:49.060 --> 1:37:55.380]  I'm very, very knowledgeable in infectious diseases. I'm very knowledgeable in genetics and the whole
[1:37:55.380 --> 1:38:01.220]  concept. I would love to have everybody understand his electrogenetics and bio energetics and how
[1:38:01.220 --> 1:38:06.660]  we can free ourselves from pharmaceutical intoxication and evolve our planet into some
[1:38:06.660 --> 1:38:13.060]  same semblance of what real health care is really about, not disease care, not disease
[1:38:13.060 --> 1:38:19.140]  induction through vaccination intoxication and chemical poisoning. We've got to stop that,
[1:38:19.140 --> 1:38:27.620]  but the bottom line is info wars. You see, that's really what this is about. Behavioral science,
[1:38:27.620 --> 1:38:34.020]  believe it or not, is the most powerful of all the sciences. My Harvard master's in public health
[1:38:34.020 --> 1:38:41.060]  is in behavioral science, media, health education, health promotion, persuasion, technologies,
[1:38:41.060 --> 1:38:47.460]  research and development. That was my principal training I published in the scientific literature
[1:38:47.460 --> 1:38:55.140]  in that field. And so when I watch TV and when I watch the news, I pick up stuff that most people
[1:38:55.140 --> 1:39:01.780]  don't. And that's what primarily gives me an indication of what I should be investigating.
[1:39:01.780 --> 1:39:06.980]  Because you were trained, I guess, with a degree to be one of their propagandists, you understand
[1:39:06.980 --> 1:39:13.780]  their program. Well, I was trained not to be one of their propagandists. I was trained in the art
[1:39:13.780 --> 1:39:18.660]  of propaganda. I was trained in the art of... That's what I mean. You went to the best school
[1:39:18.660 --> 1:39:22.340]  they've got in this whole medical system for the whole thought system.
[1:39:22.340 --> 1:39:29.060]  I can tell you my training is really excellent. I'm very thankful for the professors that I had
[1:39:29.620 --> 1:39:35.060]  and the opportunities that I've had by the grace of the creator. But I can tell you that when I
[1:39:35.060 --> 1:39:43.060]  was able to discern and predict the anthrax scam by watching the news, I literally watched
[1:39:44.180 --> 1:39:51.700]  in stunning awe at how the bear corporation that was on the verge of bankruptcy
[1:39:51.700 --> 1:39:58.260]  was wielding the mainstream media. And there were some powerful political forces working
[1:39:58.260 --> 1:40:05.060]  to engage the media that were now within fluscam.com. On the website fluscam.com,
[1:40:05.060 --> 1:40:11.620]  the affidavit that you mentioned. And you've linked it to infowars.com. Thank you. Because
[1:40:11.620 --> 1:40:19.860]  this now is exposing the heart of the global beast. It is a trust that wields the mainstream media.
[1:40:19.860 --> 1:40:26.660]  And whether you're talking about 9-11, whether you're talking about the inside job of 9-11,
[1:40:26.660 --> 1:40:32.420]  and who pulled the buildings and how it was arranged, and who then manipulated the media
[1:40:32.420 --> 1:40:38.500]  and the mass mind following 9-11, or whether you're currently talking about healthcare reform
[1:40:38.500 --> 1:40:43.300]  and how it's all being manipulated through the mainstream media. And then you bring it into
[1:40:43.300 --> 1:40:50.100]  the domain of the flu and the swine flu, where these viruses came from, who's making the money,
[1:40:50.100 --> 1:40:55.940]  who's manipulating the mass mind. That's what the affidavit is all about. And that's what the
[1:40:55.940 --> 1:41:02.180]  expose is all about, using hard, cold, documented facts. And essentially,
[1:41:02.180 --> 1:41:09.380]  I think it's not just been filed by me now. I've been so busy over the last 48 hours,
[1:41:09.380 --> 1:41:15.940]  preparing notarized copies for people all over the United States to be filing this affidavit
[1:41:15.940 --> 1:41:23.540]  on behalf of their efforts. And again, there are many, many discrepancies between the attorneys.
[1:41:23.540 --> 1:41:29.700]  One says one thing, one recommends something else. The sad reality is that we have such a
[1:41:29.700 --> 1:41:38.500]  system of injustice and dysfunction within our judicial system that really goes to the very
[1:41:38.500 --> 1:41:45.940]  heart of where your civil suits and your federal suits are blocked because it's so dysfunctional.
[1:41:45.940 --> 1:41:50.260]  We can't even get a consensus among a team of attorneys. We're working with the top
[1:41:50.260 --> 1:41:54.900]  constitutional attorneys in the United States, and they're just delaying, delaying, delaying
[1:41:54.900 --> 1:41:59.860]  because they don't know what to do. Well, anyway, we the people have got to get the message out
[1:41:59.860 --> 1:42:06.580]  whatever way possible. And the affidavit is simply my best effort to support everybody out there
[1:42:06.580 --> 1:42:14.020]  that's trying to get an injunction against the FDA, against the health authorities in the various
[1:42:14.020 --> 1:42:20.420]  states. Tomorrow here in Laguna Beach, we're confronting the health department as well as
[1:42:20.420 --> 1:42:25.060]  the school administrators. The sad reality is currently where I'm sitting right now,
[1:42:25.700 --> 1:42:31.540]  I have a daughter in a public school, and the parent teachers association is meeting tomorrow
[1:42:31.540 --> 1:42:39.940]  night in an effort to advance the Homeland Security, the biopreparedness administration.
[1:42:39.940 --> 1:42:46.580]  In other words, the parents are now being engaged in the administration of vaccinations and or
[1:42:46.580 --> 1:42:53.060]  quarantine. The entire population is being co-opted, and I've now confirmed applied
[1:42:53.620 --> 1:42:58.260]  digital solutions. We're going to cover this in a few minutes, has now gotten the patent
[1:42:58.260 --> 1:43:03.620]  and for quote, implanting people who've been triaged or vaccinated. So they decide not to
[1:43:03.620 --> 1:43:08.580]  treat you, you get an implantable chip, or if you've had the vaccine, you get a chip to prove
[1:43:09.620 --> 1:43:17.700]  that you've gone along with this. That is in my stack here. So this is just amazing,
[1:43:17.700 --> 1:43:21.220]  but I want to get into that coming up. Dr. Horowitz, let's go back to those four points,
[1:43:21.220 --> 1:43:26.340]  though, in detail. First off, to give us the play by play with the anthrax prediction,
[1:43:26.340 --> 1:43:30.980]  then the FBI visiting you and what you said at your home and office to them about here's who
[1:43:30.980 --> 1:43:36.740]  did it, and then later your evidence was proven correct. Well, what happened was, again, I was
[1:43:36.740 --> 1:43:44.660]  sitting home watching the news. This was two weeks following 9-11, and I was watching Peter
[1:43:44.660 --> 1:43:51.860]  Jennings on ABC, and he ended his Wednesday night broadcast saying, quote, tomorrow we're going to
[1:43:51.860 --> 1:43:58.900]  study anthrax. No, tomorrow we're going to have a look at anthrax. We're going through your fears
[1:43:58.900 --> 1:44:06.340]  one by one, day by day, good night. And so I go, well, man, I got to this because I've been studying
[1:44:06.340 --> 1:44:14.260]  anthrax for about three years. And so the next night was an infomercial, a half an hour infomercial
[1:44:14.260 --> 1:44:21.460]  for Bear Corporation Cipro. Cipro was a totally toxic drug. It was the only drug speciously
[1:44:21.460 --> 1:44:27.940]  selected by the FDA. So you were seeing the pre-advertising for the attack that was coming,
[1:44:27.940 --> 1:44:33.140]  a huge promotion of this helps you with anthrax. You're going, why would anybody need that? That's
[1:44:33.140 --> 1:44:39.540]  pretty obvious. Yeah, because literally you could go to Italian food restaurants, eat a lot of garlic,
[1:44:39.540 --> 1:44:45.380]  and be protected against anthrax. You didn't need to take Cipro at a cost of $700 for a
[1:44:45.380 --> 1:44:50.660]  60-day supply that was neurotoxic, and it was obvious that it had never been tested.
[1:44:50.660 --> 1:44:54.900]  And you said it was neurotoxic at the time. That's now admitted in Japan's bandit.
[1:44:54.900 --> 1:44:59.060]  Well, exactly. I mean, this is the same thing we see over and over and over again.
[1:44:59.060 --> 1:45:05.380]  Look at limericks. Look at the Lyme vaccine. It was totally toxic. We knew it was going to cause
[1:45:05.380 --> 1:45:10.500]  25, 26% of the people that got it is going to suffer from Lyme disease after getting it.
[1:45:10.500 --> 1:45:16.580]  We saw the same thing coming with biox, hideously toxic. And so you, and the same thing right now
[1:45:16.580 --> 1:45:23.140]  with the squailing and the adjuvant additives within the flu vaccine, totally untested.
[1:45:23.140 --> 1:45:27.540]  The reports are coming in. The governments are issuing reports to neurologists saying,
[1:45:27.540 --> 1:45:33.620]  be on the lookout for tremendously increased cases of caseloads of Gillian beret neurological
[1:45:33.620 --> 1:45:38.180]  impairments and autoimmune diseases following the flu vaccine. So we're really,
[1:45:38.980 --> 1:45:44.580]  we know what's going to happen. You've got to be an absolute idiot not to know how toxic these
[1:45:44.580 --> 1:45:48.020]  vaccines are. And we're going to get into the vaccines, but specifically I want to go through
[1:45:48.020 --> 1:45:52.740]  those four points. We've got you for another 45 minutes. Dr. Horowitz, then the FBI doesn't listen
[1:45:52.740 --> 1:45:57.540]  to you at the time though, when you first try to warn them, then they show up months later.
[1:45:57.540 --> 1:46:04.740]  Yeah. I mean, it's total hypocrisy because they were advertising a million dollar reward for anybody
[1:46:04.740 --> 1:46:12.100]  that would give them the information necessary to apprehend the varmints. And what I did was,
[1:46:12.100 --> 1:46:18.420]  I led them to the Bethel Memorial Institute in West Jefferson, Ohio, which is the one-stop
[1:46:18.420 --> 1:46:24.100]  shopping mall for anything military and bio, you know, biological weapons. I also led them
[1:46:24.900 --> 1:46:31.460]  to the anthrax ace, William Patrick, the third CIA operative, number one bio weapons developer
[1:46:31.460 --> 1:46:40.020]  for anthrax and the Russian dissident defector, Alebukov, Ken Alebuk, Elias. He was working with
[1:46:40.020 --> 1:46:46.820]  the CIA and the CIA's project was called Clear Vision. All of that came out ultimately mostly
[1:46:46.820 --> 1:46:54.420]  by my prodding. William Broad of the New York Times did us a favor. I counted him to expose the
[1:46:54.420 --> 1:46:59.380]  Bethel Memorial Institute. So even in the New York Times, he came out with Clear Vision being the
[1:46:59.380 --> 1:47:07.700]  CIA operation by which the anthrax that was totally unique, just like this H1N1 is completely
[1:47:07.700 --> 1:47:12.740]  unique. I'm telling you, there's no possible way that it was anything but a laboratory creation
[1:47:12.740 --> 1:47:19.940]  and any fool would know. How else could you possibly get an Asian chicken virus,
[1:47:19.940 --> 1:47:28.180]  recombine with a Mexican swine pig virus, recombine with a dead corpse from 1918 Spanish flu
[1:47:28.180 --> 1:47:34.900]  virus, recombine with what's going on right now with a normal flu into the population,
[1:47:34.900 --> 1:47:41.300]  have it inspect two children initially in Southern California living 100 miles apart
[1:47:41.860 --> 1:47:47.540]  that never met each other. Then a couple days later, they never went to Mexico. Mexicans
[1:47:47.540 --> 1:47:54.100]  didn't come visit them. Suddenly you've got the same totally unique, never before seen extraordinary
[1:47:54.100 --> 1:48:00.660]  virus bringing out in Mexico. Well, sir, what about foot and mouth in 2001? It pops up in over 30
[1:48:00.660 --> 1:48:05.460]  locations from Scotland to Cornwall from the south of England to the north in the same two-day
[1:48:05.460 --> 1:48:11.700]  period. And there's laboratory people there. Part of Porton Down is part of an anti-zoological
[1:48:11.700 --> 1:48:17.220]  bioterrorism drill. We said clearly they planted it. They used it to kill 4 million cows, 8 million
[1:48:17.220 --> 1:48:21.700]  sheep that didn't even have it, bring in biological tyranny and control. And then two years later,
[1:48:21.700 --> 1:48:26.500]  they admitted, okay, the government accidentally released it from Porton Down Bioweapons Lab.
[1:48:26.500 --> 1:48:31.140]  Then they killed Dr. David Kelly to shut him up about it. Right. And then most of the public
[1:48:31.140 --> 1:48:37.940]  don't know when I published the book, Death in the Air, Globalism, Terrorism, and Toxic Warfare
[1:48:37.940 --> 1:48:45.060]  three months before 9-11. And I showed you that the Tyson Corporation was operating using biological
[1:48:45.060 --> 1:48:51.860]  weapons in order to literally conduct industrial espionage and sabotage. They were literally
[1:48:51.860 --> 1:48:59.780]  infecting the chickens in Asia with H1 and 1. That's the first time the world learned about
[1:48:59.780 --> 1:49:06.100]  H1 and 1. When we know the CIA over and over again will release bacteria, viruses, and insects,
[1:49:06.100 --> 1:49:12.580]  even in the 50s, in places like Guatemala. Absolutely. That's declassified. Absolutely.
[1:49:12.580 --> 1:49:18.100]  Yeah. So, you know, what we've done is we've exposed the heart of the beast with hard-cold
[1:49:18.100 --> 1:49:27.700]  documents that really are compelling. And that we ask everybody to go to the FluScam.com website,
[1:49:27.700 --> 1:49:34.820]  read the affidavit, make copies of it, if you have people that can bring injunctions and or
[1:49:34.820 --> 1:49:42.180]  lawsuits against those who are perpetrating this fraud and literal genocide. It is definitely
[1:49:42.820 --> 1:49:47.940]  not a term that we use sensationally. If you look up the word, what does genocide mean?
[1:49:47.940 --> 1:49:52.900]  And it's such a sad thing that we, in America, we don't want to talk about the genocide that
[1:49:52.900 --> 1:49:58.660]  happened here. Give people the definition. The definition is, quote, the mass killing or
[1:49:58.660 --> 1:50:07.380]  enslaving of people for profit, politics, and or ideology, end quote, Webster's dictionary.
[1:50:09.060 --> 1:50:13.940]  So, this is what's going on. You've got all three. You've got number one, you've got money being
[1:50:13.940 --> 1:50:19.060]  made by the drug industrials. We're going to talk about, and like the affidavit shares with you
[1:50:19.060 --> 1:50:27.620]  and shows you, hard document proves the Rockefeller cartel from the partnership from New York City
[1:50:27.620 --> 1:50:33.380]  is engaged in a global cartel that is wielding the mass media. Stay there. Stay there. We're
[1:50:33.380 --> 1:50:36.820]  going to come back. I'm going to sit back. Go through your affidavit in detail. When I read
[1:50:36.820 --> 1:50:42.180]  your affidavit, it was all clicking because it was the same Rockefeller partnership with New York
[1:50:42.180 --> 1:50:47.140]  that controlled the Port Authority and the towers that leased it to Silverstein. And then when I
[1:50:47.140 --> 1:50:52.420]  got to the end of your affidavit, you made that point. So, we were on the same page. As I was
[1:50:52.420 --> 1:50:57.140]  reading it last night, I knew what was going to be next because I knew the information. And that's
[1:50:57.140 --> 1:51:01.380]  when you know something's accurate, is when you can separately verify it because you already know
[1:51:01.380 --> 1:51:06.020]  it. And I want to tell you about Grafundersafes, the makers of the highest quality safes and vault

[1:53:06.420 --> 1:53:12.500]  and we knew what to do. Or at least we thought we did. Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film
[1:53:12.500 --> 1:53:21.140]  that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story. Whitman, EVA director on the 18th
[1:53:21.140 --> 1:53:28.020]  made a statement that the air was safe to breathe. This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11
[1:53:28.020 --> 1:53:33.220]  Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters. He had his
[1:53:33.220 --> 1:53:37.300]  hand over the radio while he was getting the countdown. He takes his hand off and you hear
[1:53:37.300 --> 1:53:44.820]  three, two, one and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[1:53:44.820 --> 1:53:51.300]  Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the
[1:53:51.300 --> 1:53:56.980]  DVD at infowars.com. If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit
[1:53:56.980 --> 1:54:13.540]  more acts and bring in martial law. Regular Army and National Guard are running checkpoints with
[1:54:13.540 --> 1:54:18.260]  police dogs barking at women and children all over Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania ahead of the world's
[1:54:18.260 --> 1:54:24.740]  criminal rulers, the G-20 arriving in two days. I'm sending a crew. Okay, Dr. Horowitz continuing,
[1:54:24.740 --> 1:54:28.660]  sir, with the points you're making to me during the break. Let's get into your affidavit and
[1:54:28.660 --> 1:54:33.460]  detail, the proof, the facts. You've got the history of the Rockefellers. They're always involved in
[1:54:33.460 --> 1:54:41.860]  this. And then where we go from there? Go ahead. Again, the heart of the beast is in New York City
[1:54:41.860 --> 1:54:51.060]  and the Rockefeller Trust is engaged with the world's most powerful men on Wall Street and
[1:54:51.060 --> 1:54:56.980]  especially the media. The people that wield the media and the mass mind are heavily engaged in
[1:54:56.980 --> 1:55:05.700]  the trust that is the most powerful biotechnology trust in the world. These are the people that
[1:55:05.700 --> 1:55:11.860]  literally make the markets for healthcare. They make and break markets. These are the people
[1:55:11.860 --> 1:55:17.860]  that are suppressing the alternative natural remedies, the Codex elementarius legislation.
[1:55:17.860 --> 1:55:22.980]  These are the people that have created the markets. Of course, you've seen the security
[1:55:22.980 --> 1:55:32.580]  market after 9-11 and all this terrorism. This is how they operate to create the markets to
[1:55:32.580 --> 1:55:38.340]  advance their financial as well as political agendas. So who are they? Well, now they have
[1:55:38.340 --> 1:55:46.500]  some names. And in terms of the politicians that are involved, gee whiz, you've got obviously
[1:55:46.500 --> 1:55:54.260]  John Holdren who's calling for depopulation through vaccinations in his early book where he's
[1:55:54.260 --> 1:56:01.540]  working with Barack Obama. And so the question becomes, all right, you've been talking about
[1:56:01.540 --> 1:56:07.460]  council on farm relations and those members of that. You've been talking about Henry Kissinger,
[1:56:07.460 --> 1:56:13.220]  the connections to Nelson Rockefeller. Well, here's for the first time really hard, cold
[1:56:13.220 --> 1:56:20.820]  documents that show the intimate relationships between Rockefeller cronies and literally this
[1:56:20.820 --> 1:56:28.340]  H1N1 swine flu fright, which is a complete fraud. So I can go, I mean, like you say,
[1:56:28.340 --> 1:56:33.620]  it's an extremely lengthy affidavit. Well down the basics of how you put this together,
[1:56:33.620 --> 1:56:38.980]  who the key players are. Well, honestly, by the grace of the creator, it all came together.
[1:56:38.980 --> 1:56:45.780]  The main players are, first of all, in the UK. So much of it is coming through Britain.
[1:56:46.340 --> 1:56:53.140]  You have to understand that most of the mainstream media, cable vision, is Rupert Murdoch.
[1:56:53.140 --> 1:56:59.540]  People don't know, but we're now exposing. For example, Murdoch's mother, a hundred-year-old
[1:56:59.540 --> 1:57:05.460]  lady, is intimately connected with the Queen of England. His daughter is, and his mother is
[1:57:05.460 --> 1:57:11.060]  actually still running right now, the place where H1N1 swine flu vaccines are being tested
[1:57:11.060 --> 1:57:18.100]  right now on babies and children and pregnant women. And his daughter, likewise, is running this
[1:57:18.100 --> 1:57:23.540]  in Australia. So we have a lot of people in Australia right now, as the Australian government
[1:57:23.540 --> 1:57:29.940]  and the English British government and the United States and Canada are advancing this genocide
[1:57:29.940 --> 1:57:35.140]  under the guise of public health and protection against H1N1. What you've got is media mogul,
[1:57:35.140 --> 1:57:42.660]  Rupert Murdoch, hideously engaged, intimately, his entire family is engaged in the vaccine
[1:57:42.660 --> 1:57:53.860]  development and research itself. That's a stunning revelation. Rupert Murdoch is co-director.
[1:57:53.860 --> 1:58:00.100]  He is a co-director. David Rockefeller founded the partnership for New York City, which is this
[1:58:00.100 --> 1:58:07.780]  trust that's conducting genocide. Rupert Murdoch is a co-director of that. And when you start to
[1:58:07.780 --> 1:58:13.460]  research that, that's when everything started to unravel. If you start to go into partnership
[1:58:13.460 --> 1:58:20.820]  for New York City and you see the biotechnology companies and the vaccine industrialists that
[1:58:20.820 --> 1:58:27.780]  are engaged with them, man, oh man, it's like the who's who of Wall Street and mainstream media
[1:58:27.780 --> 1:58:32.340]  intimately engaged in this process of health care reform. So they're not just the main advertisers,
[1:58:32.340 --> 1:58:35.860]  it's the owners of the media involved in the Rockefeller Foundation pushed all the
[1:58:35.860 --> 1:58:38.980]  cancer virus research in the 20s and 30s back in one minute.

[1:58:54.980 --> 1:59:00.340]  really know what's in your tap water? In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor,
[1:59:00.340 --> 1:59:05.620]  they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water. Many of
[1:59:05.620 --> 1:59:09.940]  these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system
[1:59:09.940 --> 1:59:15.620]  diseases. Now, what are you going to do about it? The Ecoloblu atmospheric water generator is a low
[1:59:15.620 --> 1:59:20.820]  cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water. The Ecoloblu 28 produces

[2:00:14.980 --> 2:00:21.460]  on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:23.780 --> 2:00:27.300]  Before Dr. Horowitz leaves us in 30 minutes, I'll be back with us later this week.
[2:00:27.300 --> 2:00:31.620]  But more information. Look at the cover of Newsweek, The Case for Killing Granny.
[2:00:32.420 --> 2:00:38.180]  And then it's this very sick story selling how it's a wonderful right to die and how the
[2:00:38.180 --> 2:00:42.740]  government's keeping people from being able to die when that's what they want is to euthanize
[2:00:42.740 --> 2:00:48.260]  people and then sickening article after article worshiping bankers and how they're like celebrities
[2:00:48.260 --> 2:00:52.420]  now because they've created tens of trillions of fiat and bought everything up. And the rest
[2:00:52.420 --> 2:00:58.900]  of this Newsweek is drug ads. It's one big incestuous disgusting group of scum. Dr. Horowitz,
[2:00:58.900 --> 2:01:11.060]  continuing with your affidavit. Dr. Horowitz, do we have you on speakerphone?
[2:01:11.060 --> 2:01:16.660]  Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Alex. The same thing when you start to look at the partnership for
[2:01:16.660 --> 2:01:22.740]  the city of New York, the connection to the royalty of Europe, I mean, literally the organization was
[2:01:23.700 --> 2:01:31.380]  chartered by the British royalty. And so you begin to realize, wow, it's no accident that John
[2:01:31.380 --> 2:01:36.900]  Robertson, who's in the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control in the UK,
[2:01:37.940 --> 2:01:44.900]  told the World Health Organization as the chief supplier of viruses for influenza and influenza
[2:01:44.900 --> 2:01:51.060]  vaccines and the chief tester for the World Health Organization of blood that have of people who
[2:01:51.060 --> 2:01:58.900]  have been vaccinated with H1N1 vaccines, that the deal in America is far better to advance this
[2:01:59.540 --> 2:02:07.140]  agenda. He also said, this is John Robertson. I'm sorry, James Robertson and Dr. John Wood,
[2:02:07.140 --> 2:02:14.580]  who are partners in the world's leading experts in this field, and that they stated clearly that
[2:02:14.580 --> 2:02:22.260]  they would prime the populations with H1N1 or whatever pandemic flu was coming. They would
[2:02:22.260 --> 2:02:29.940]  prime them in advance. And so that's what we are looking at with the Mexican flu outbreak and the
[2:02:29.940 --> 2:02:39.540]  H1N1 that circulated. It was a laboratory-sourced virus, and that's not unusual in history. In 1977,
[2:02:39.540 --> 2:02:44.900]  the swine flu that broke out, and then also, that was one year after the mysterious,
[2:02:45.620 --> 2:02:51.540]  probably military experiment at Fort Dix, which again led to the initial swine flu
[2:02:51.540 --> 2:02:59.860]  fright and the hideous Gillian Berre disease-inducing vaccination campaign back in 1976.
[2:02:59.860 --> 2:03:05.780]  That was a laboratory-sourced virus. Says who? Says the New England Journal of Medicine a couple
[2:03:05.780 --> 2:03:12.980]  weeks ago. So you've got to really take a clear look at who's pulling the strings between Rockefeller
[2:03:12.980 --> 2:03:18.020]  and the royalty of Europe. And I want to spend more time on this, because you said this three
[2:03:18.020 --> 2:03:23.860]  months ago on the show. It's since come out in UN documents we covered last week where they said
[2:03:24.660 --> 2:03:30.820]  so that people get better immunity when we give them the vaccine will release these
[2:03:30.820 --> 2:03:36.820]  these simulant viruses into the population. What does that mean? It means that they have
[2:03:36.820 --> 2:03:43.620]  genetically engineered viruses, such as what we talked about, a combination of swine flu
[2:03:44.340 --> 2:03:54.020]  from 1918. I'm sorry, yes, it was the Spanish flu from 1918 with a swine flu with a genetic
[2:03:54.020 --> 2:04:00.980]  sequence of the avian flu from Asia. But they just calmly announce, like it's no big deal on
[2:04:00.980 --> 2:04:06.820]  the who's own website, the UN, that they're releasing this stuff. Yes, and that was made
[2:04:06.820 --> 2:04:13.620]  clear additionally in a recent World Health Organization released a press release to gain
[2:04:13.620 --> 2:04:19.220]  publicity to help allegedly ensure people that these vaccines are safe. They actually said the
[2:04:19.220 --> 2:04:24.980]  same thing that they've that they're releasing new mock up files they call it. They don't even
[2:04:24.980 --> 2:04:29.060]  call them viruses anymore. They don't want people to be alarmed. So they call them new names, the
[2:04:29.060 --> 2:04:39.460]  new terminology for viruses, laboratory, mutated, hybridized combinations, recombinants are mock
[2:04:39.460 --> 2:04:46.900]  up files, biosimilars. These are the types of words that they're using that basically keeps
[2:04:46.900 --> 2:04:49.940]  people ignorant about what they're really doing. And they just do it right out in the open. So if
[2:04:49.940 --> 2:04:53.540]  they ever get caught, they say, yeah, we admitted we did. It's like Silverstein says, yeah, we pull
[2:04:53.540 --> 2:04:57.700]  Building 7. They have the order and watch the building come down. And then no one's supposed
[2:04:57.700 --> 2:05:01.940]  to discuss it. Stay there, Dr. Horowitz. Let's continue. Have you ever wanted to generate your
[2:05:01.940 --> 2:05:06.500]  own supply of electrical power? If so, this is going to be the most important message you will
[2:05:06.500 --> 2:05:11.940]  ever hear. Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[2:05:11.940 --> 2:05:16.500]  These emergency backup systems provide life saving electrical power when you need it most.
[2:05:16.500 --> 2:05:21.860]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes and produces electricity
[2:05:21.860 --> 2:05:26.500]  for free. It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home. Run
[2:05:26.500 --> 2:05:31.460]  sun pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling. Whether it's
[2:05:31.460 --> 2:05:36.260]  hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful
[2:05:36.260 --> 2:05:41.540]  power outages again. When the power goes out, you'll be ready. With a solar power generator
[2:05:41.540 --> 2:05:50.260]  from Solutions from Science, go to mysolarbackup.com and get off the grid today. That's mysolarbackup.com
[2:05:50.260 --> 2:06:14.340]  or call 877-327-0365. 877-327-0365. Don't wait. Call today.
[2:06:14.340 --> 2:06:44.260]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well. Here's what you do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times. This book will work for anyone. Rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter. This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well. You know the government isn't looking out for you. You need to look out for yourself. The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse. You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[2:06:44.260 --> 2:06:56.180]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today. Again, it is. Here's what you do.net. That's here's what you do.net. One last time. It's here's what you do.net.
[2:06:56.180 --> 2:07:16.180]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children happy? It's fine. But they won't say. That's fine.
[2:07:16.180 --> 2:07:21.420]  How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it?
[2:07:21.420 --> 2:07:26.500]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick?
[2:07:26.500 --> 2:07:31.660]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[2:07:31.660 --> 2:07:35.080]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[2:07:35.260 --> 2:07:41.140]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know.
[2:07:41.140 --> 2:07:44.260]  How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.
[2:07:44.260 --> 2:07:53.420]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at
[2:07:53.420 --> 2:07:59.100]  eFoodsDirect.com. Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[2:08:02.060 --> 2:08:08.340]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[2:08:08.340 --> 2:08:14.340]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:08:14.340 --> 2:08:19.340]  I'm going to clear the phone board. I apologize to those that were holding from earlier.
[2:08:19.340 --> 2:08:23.340]  You can call back in and go to the front of the line when we clear the board again later.
[2:08:23.340 --> 2:08:29.340]  I want to clear the board for five questions, five callers for Dr. Lynn Horowitz.
[2:08:29.340 --> 2:08:37.340]  1-800-259-9231-1800-259-9231 only on the flu.
[2:08:37.340 --> 2:08:39.340]  That's coming up in about 10 minutes.
[2:08:39.340 --> 2:08:44.340]  We're having back up throughout the week. We've got Dr. Blalock coming on, Dr. Tenpenny coming back on,
[2:08:44.340 --> 2:08:50.340]  Steve Quayle coming back on. We're going to be covering this intensely as the attempts at forced inoculations begin.
[2:08:50.340 --> 2:08:54.340]  And so Dr. Horowitz is just touching on key points here, key points there.
[2:08:54.340 --> 2:09:01.340]  Go to fluscam.com. We have it also mirrored up at infowars.com, the PDF and links to his site.
[2:09:01.340 --> 2:09:07.340]  Go read the entire close to 50 page affidavit for yourself if you care about your family.
[2:09:07.340 --> 2:09:12.340]  Look at the points he's making because they began the fear mongering in January.
[2:09:12.340 --> 2:09:17.340]  We had emergency managers and journalists on saying the government's getting ready for mass graves,
[2:09:17.340 --> 2:09:24.340]  martial law in the fall for flu. And we said, folks, we've never seen so much military personnel being put in place.
[2:09:24.340 --> 2:09:30.340]  I believe they wanted to use this in the fall to pass their healthcare agenda, their eugenics agenda, their banking agenda.
[2:09:30.340 --> 2:09:38.340]  And to use it as a political cover. Then in April, we learned it was really at a level six when the first scare started.
[2:09:38.340 --> 2:09:43.340]  I got secret documents from the state of Texas, posted those. Months later, it was confirmed I was right.
[2:09:43.340 --> 2:09:48.340]  Dr. Horowitz separately confirmed they were going to level six in May, early May.
[2:09:48.340 --> 2:09:55.340]  That was later confirmed two months later. And so what we know is when we see them line up, prepare, get ready,
[2:09:55.340 --> 2:10:03.340]  already start the vaccine lines of the genetically engineered cloned viruses and virus hybrids.
[2:10:03.340 --> 2:10:11.340]  That's the telltale sign. Just like when Dr. Horowitz saw congressional studies of mailing weaponized anthrax through the mail two years before 9-11,
[2:10:11.340 --> 2:10:17.340]  he started saying they're going to launch an anthrax attack. Because once you study, big operations have to be prepared.
[2:10:17.340 --> 2:10:29.340]  And even if they're secret, the physical manifestation, the buildup of the petrochemical, pharmacological, military industrial complex system is manifest in front of you.
[2:10:29.340 --> 2:10:34.340]  And if you're watching it, you can see it. Dr. Horowitz continuing, sir.
[2:10:34.340 --> 2:10:44.340]  Well, you got to look at the companies that are involved here. All of the six companies that are producing the vaccinations have intimate connections to the principals,
[2:10:44.340 --> 2:10:58.340]  the chief suspect, the chief genocidalist, Rockefeller. You're looking at Zuckerman. You're looking at, as I mentioned before, the connections to the royalty of Europe.
[2:10:58.340 --> 2:11:07.340]  You're looking at Michael Greenberg, who is the clinical research developer for vaccines at CSL Corporation.
[2:11:07.340 --> 2:11:16.340]  The people also, he was with Smith Klein Beach. And these are the organizations that are advancing now.
[2:11:16.340 --> 2:11:29.340]  The research with Rupert Murdoch's organization in Australia and advancing these vaccinations that so sadly contain these not just mutated viral live viruses,
[2:11:29.340 --> 2:11:39.340]  manmade laboratory creations, but the poisons, the squalene, the products that are being produced by CSL.
[2:11:39.340 --> 2:11:53.340]  It's called MF-59. Another little piece of incredible information is that America's chief AIDS czar, Dr. Anthony Fauci,
[2:11:53.340 --> 2:12:01.340]  the director of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases. That's your premier infectious disease organization in the United States.
[2:12:01.340 --> 2:12:10.340]  Dr. Fauci has been the principal promoter of people getting the flu vaccine. He is intimately connected with these organizations.
[2:12:10.340 --> 2:12:24.340]  He's on the take, profiteering. He's got a co-patent. He's a co-patent holder on the ingredient, Interleukin II, IL-2, within the MF-59 adjuvant.
[2:12:24.340 --> 2:12:31.340]  It is, again, linked to AIDS, to HIV. Stunning, another stunning revelation.
[2:12:31.340 --> 2:12:38.340]  Baxter Corporation actually is producing their vaccine, not in chicken eggs. They're using African green monkey.
[2:12:38.340 --> 2:12:45.340]  Baxter is one of the most hideously untrustworthy biotech companies and vaccine manufacturers in the world.
[2:12:45.340 --> 2:12:52.340]  Why the European governments have primarily used Baxter for their vaccines is absolutely malfeasant.
[2:12:52.340 --> 2:12:59.340]  An expanding Dr. Tim Penny says that some of this flu vaccine has been grown on dead baby retinas.
[2:12:59.340 --> 2:13:08.340]  That may be, I don't have that document to say that, but I definitely have the document that shows that they're using Vero cells.
[2:13:08.340 --> 2:13:17.340]  In fact, I did an interview following a Baxter representative in Spain yesterday and that they admitted using Vero cells,
[2:13:17.340 --> 2:13:25.340]  which is the African green monkey, that Dr. Hilleman, on the internet, I posted a YouTube segment where Dr. Maurice Hilleman,
[2:13:25.340 --> 2:13:32.340]  from the Merck Pharmaceutical Company, and that company is hideously implicated also in this global scam.
[2:13:32.340 --> 2:13:36.340]  Let me stop you. I've got a lot of nexus points I want to throw at you here.
[2:13:36.340 --> 2:13:40.340]  It's clear we're going to have to do more interviews in the next two days. This is so big.
[2:13:40.340 --> 2:13:46.340]  Baxter separately mixed the weaponized bird flu, quote by accident, at 14 different labs in Europe.
[2:13:46.340 --> 2:13:50.340]  There was then, the London Telegraph reported, a secret company.
[2:13:50.340 --> 2:13:56.340]  They've indicted all the government officials that were involved in Poland. A large percentage of the homeless they gave it to,
[2:13:56.340 --> 2:14:01.340]  saying it was a regular flu vaccine and paid them to take it, died. That's London Telegraph.
[2:14:01.340 --> 2:14:05.340]  But when I talked to you last time, you're saying you don't believe it's Baxter that did that.
[2:14:05.340 --> 2:14:10.340]  It was another company. I mean, this just goes on and on.
[2:14:10.340 --> 2:14:16.340]  Then we have Gardasil, and now they're having to admit what you said three years ago, that in the trials it was killing young girls that took it.
[2:14:16.340 --> 2:14:21.340]  And on top of that, build.de, the biggest newspaper in Germany is reporting,
[2:14:21.340 --> 2:14:28.340]  with top scientist in an article titled, Does Virus Vaccine Increase the Risk of Cancer?
[2:14:28.340 --> 2:14:36.340]  That has top scientist in Germany, virologist, saying that it has live cancer viruses in it because it was grown in monkeys.
[2:14:36.340 --> 2:14:41.340]  Exactly. Exactly right. And Baxter is heavily implicated.
[2:14:41.340 --> 2:14:46.340]  The company that I was referring to in the United States issue was Novavax,
[2:14:46.340 --> 2:14:55.340]  which now has been bought out by one of the other major large H1N1 flu vaccine manufacturers called Novartis.
[2:14:55.340 --> 2:15:05.340]  But when you get to the heart of the piece, and you see literally all of the fingers of the octopus emanating from New York City in this partnership,
[2:15:05.340 --> 2:15:14.340]  this trust that David Rockefeller and the royalty of Europe control through their main money managers and media manipulators,
[2:15:14.340 --> 2:15:19.340]  Rupert Murdoch on down, you begin to see what we're really facing here.
[2:15:19.340 --> 2:15:24.340]  A total scam. The whole thing shall fall apart as everyone.
[2:15:24.340 --> 2:15:28.340]  If everyone were simply to take this information, to read the affidavit,
[2:15:28.340 --> 2:15:39.340]  sending out the David to law enforcement to begin advancing the objections and the injunctions that are basically now obviously needed.
[2:15:39.340 --> 2:15:42.340]  You believe this is the path to victory, you told me privately,
[2:15:42.340 --> 2:15:50.340]  that it will just educate everyone about what's happening so the establishment may not move with this operation if they know the jig is up?
[2:15:50.340 --> 2:15:53.340]  Well, here's what I'm going to predict.
[2:15:53.340 --> 2:15:58.340]  You know, again, I'm going to stick my neck out and I pray that I'm not right. I pray that I'm wrong.
[2:15:58.340 --> 2:16:05.340]  But you see, they're so heavily invested and they already have lost because it just came out in PubMed.
[2:16:05.340 --> 2:16:10.340]  I just posted it on fluscam.com on the latest news page. You can read it.
[2:16:10.340 --> 2:16:18.340]  You can link right to PubMed and see the study where only 47% of doctors surveyed,
[2:16:18.340 --> 2:16:23.340]  that's medical doctors surveyed, would take the vaccine because the rest of them,
[2:16:23.340 --> 2:16:27.340]  the vast majority are not going to allow it because of what you and I,
[2:16:27.340 --> 2:16:32.340]  what our colleagues all over, Dr. Ken Penny, Russell Blaylock,
[2:16:32.340 --> 2:16:39.340]  all of these heroes out there have been telling the truth and the doctors now are picking up enough of the information to say,
[2:16:39.340 --> 2:16:43.340]  hey, I don't trust this for my family, myself or my patients.
[2:16:43.340 --> 2:16:51.340]  Now, we've already won the majority. Now, what I fear is that because they are so heavily invested in population reduction,
[2:16:51.340 --> 2:16:57.340]  population manipulation, and that they're going, and this whole investment in biotech,
[2:16:57.340 --> 2:17:02.340]  what they're going to do is just like they did with 9-11, they're going to pull it.
[2:17:02.340 --> 2:17:10.340]  They're going to probably, again, my hunch is right, the only option is to loose something that's going to cause a local outbreak
[2:17:10.340 --> 2:17:17.340]  in a city such as LA or potentially even New York, and the mass media is going to jump on it.
[2:17:17.340 --> 2:17:23.340]  They're going to say we've got to issue mandatory vaccinations now. Sorry, folks.
[2:17:23.340 --> 2:17:27.340]  I know I said Barack Obama's going to say sorry. I know I said it was going to be voluntary,
[2:17:27.340 --> 2:17:33.340]  but under the circumstances now of this urgency and people dying, we've got to make it mandatory.
[2:17:33.340 --> 2:17:36.340]  Now you've got all the other pieces of evidence.
[2:17:36.340 --> 2:17:40.340]  They're already telling medical workers in New York and Europe in places they've got to take it,
[2:17:40.340 --> 2:17:47.340]  and they've already are trying to pass federal and state laws saying four quarantines under level six.
[2:17:47.340 --> 2:17:52.340]  We're going to have forced inoculations. They've been drilling the military and police the last few years for that.
[2:17:52.340 --> 2:17:58.340]  Well, that's exactly right. And this is the intelligence that you're receiving. I'm confirming. Others are confirming.
[2:17:58.340 --> 2:18:06.340]  So we're really looking at, again, the urgency is we'd like to be able to not have anybody show up to get vaccinated.
[2:18:06.340 --> 2:18:13.340]  But again, that's not their agenda. Their agenda is to intoxicate and enslave humanity to drugs.
[2:18:13.340 --> 2:18:21.340]  It's very clear simply if you watch the indoctrination taking place through the mainstream media on prime time.
[2:18:21.340 --> 2:18:28.340]  For a 60-second ad for drugs, you get 10 seconds of side effects, not because they're compelled by law,
[2:18:28.340 --> 2:18:33.340]  because they want to shape the attitude, the culture.
[2:18:33.340 --> 2:18:41.340]  Tell me if I'm correct from your perspective. They knew Gardasil would kill people in the trials.
[2:18:41.340 --> 2:18:46.340]  They put it out wanting to set the precedent that people die and nobody gets in trouble, and we just accept it.
[2:18:46.340 --> 2:18:53.340]  And they know the flu shot's going to kill in Maine. Their own CDC documents say that. And then the Reuters had an article saying,
[2:18:53.340 --> 2:18:58.340]  yeah, millions are going to die, but people are going to say it's the vaccine, but it's not going to be the vaccine.
[2:18:58.340 --> 2:19:03.340]  So they're really just testing soft-kill weapons out in the open, seeing if they can get away with it.
[2:19:03.340 --> 2:19:09.340]  Right. And they're also totally suppressing all the alters, total gross negligence.
[2:19:09.340 --> 2:19:13.340]  They could be recommending vitamin C. They could be recommending vitamin D.
[2:19:13.340 --> 2:19:18.340]  They could be recommending the silver hydrosols. Oxy-silver is a perfect example.
[2:19:18.340 --> 2:19:26.340]  Total suppression. Instead of heralding the natural things that are low cost, no risk, highly effective alternatives
[2:19:26.340 --> 2:19:32.340]  to all of these hideous toxic waste that they're administering, they could be advancing true...
[2:19:32.340 --> 2:19:38.340]  By the way, that's not just you. I've had scores of medical doctors on that just say 30 minutes of sun every day
[2:19:38.340 --> 2:19:42.340]  is way more powerful than any antiviral or vaccine.
[2:19:42.340 --> 2:19:46.340]  Right. They just want to poison us and make money off of humanity suffering.
[2:19:46.340 --> 2:19:51.340]  Well, we're designed to be in the sun, just like a plant. I mean, we need sun, correct, doctor?
[2:19:51.340 --> 2:19:55.340]  Absolutely. And I don't believe in sunblocks. I never use it myself.
[2:19:55.340 --> 2:20:00.340]  Well, it's pure aluminum. We'll be right back with Dr. Lynn Horowitz in your calls.
[2:20:00.340 --> 2:20:04.340]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[2:20:04.340 --> 2:20:08.340]  If it's Berkey water purification systems, this message is for you.
[2:20:08.340 --> 2:20:14.340]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride, had less than 2 cents per gallon?
[2:20:14.340 --> 2:20:21.340]  Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine fluoride and contaminants from municipal water.
[2:20:21.340 --> 2:20:27.340]  These filters are powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water, making them perfect for rainwater collection systems.
[2:20:27.340 --> 2:20:32.340]  From the smallest to the largest systems, bigberkeywaterfilters.com has what you need.

[2:21:00.340 --> 2:21:07.340]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[2:21:07.340 --> 2:21:11.340]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[2:21:11.340 --> 2:21:13.340]  Bin Laden. This is his MO.
[2:21:13.340 --> 2:21:16.340]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[2:21:16.340 --> 2:21:23.340]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[2:21:23.340 --> 2:21:30.340]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US.
[2:21:30.340 --> 2:21:34.340]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:21:34.340 --> 2:21:41.340]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[2:21:41.340 --> 2:21:46.340]  warnings in war games, the shadow government and much, much more. Fabled Enemies.

[2:21:53.340 --> 2:22:00.340]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[2:22:00.340 --> 2:22:07.340]  Hello, Ted Anderson. Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[2:22:07.340 --> 2:22:15.340]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[2:22:15.340 --> 2:22:20.340]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[2:22:20.340 --> 2:22:27.340]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to ensure deposits during a bank run, followed by a depressed economy.
[2:22:27.340 --> 2:22:33.340]  A current effort is underway by the Fed, along with other central banks, to increase liquidity for depositors.
[2:22:33.340 --> 2:22:38.340]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation.
[2:22:38.340 --> 2:22:46.340]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[2:22:46.340 --> 2:22:53.340]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[2:22:53.340 --> 2:23:00.340]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237. That's 1-800-686-2237.
[2:23:00.340 --> 2:23:06.340]  When it comes to emergency preparedness, you know it's the responsible thing to do for you and your family.
[2:23:06.340 --> 2:23:11.340]  You also know that preparedness, though a necessity, can cost hundreds, even thousands of dollars.
[2:23:11.340 --> 2:23:16.340]  Unfortunately in these tough economic times, most cannot get ready for emergency situations.
[2:23:16.340 --> 2:23:21.340]  For many, preparedness has been placed on the back burner. This year has been tough for everyone.
[2:23:21.340 --> 2:23:25.340]  But that doesn't mean you shouldn't have any less of a chance in a crisis.
[2:23:25.340 --> 2:23:28.340]  That's why Ready Reserve is offering wholesale pricing to the public.
[2:23:28.340 --> 2:23:34.340]  When you're ready, give us a call, and we'll work with your budget and family size to help you grow your preparedness needs.
[2:23:34.340 --> 2:23:36.340]  The worst thing you can do is nothing.

[2:24:09.340 --> 2:24:13.340]  Dr. Horowitz has big breaking news either tomorrow on the show or Thursday,
[2:24:13.340 --> 2:24:16.340]  but I'll be with us at noon central tomorrow for another hour.
[2:24:16.340 --> 2:24:21.340]  To get more into his affidavit and new developments right now, let's take some calls in this segment and the next.
[2:24:21.340 --> 2:24:26.340]  Then I have a guest coming on for about 10 minutes about government taking blood at warrantless checkpoints.
[2:24:26.340 --> 2:24:31.340]  That's coming up. Then I must spend the whole last hour with your calls on the flu in the police state.
[2:24:31.340 --> 2:24:34.340]  Charlie in Texas, you're on the air with Dr. Lynn Horowitz. Go ahead.
[2:24:34.340 --> 2:24:41.340]  Thank you, gentlemen. I was only calling to inform you that here in Texas is actually the Seton Network.
[2:24:41.340 --> 2:24:47.340]  Maybe I shouldn't say that. Seton Network of Hospitals. Go ahead.
[2:24:47.340 --> 2:24:54.340]  Yes, sir. I know someone just being forced to take the both shots that they're going to have available
[2:24:54.340 --> 2:24:57.340]  or three shots or whatever it is or lose their job.
[2:24:57.340 --> 2:25:02.340]  Yeah, they're quietly all over the country and it's even been in some newspapers ordering them to take it with no law.
[2:25:02.340 --> 2:25:03.340]  Dr. Horowitz?
[2:25:03.340 --> 2:25:06.340]  Right. You have a religious and spiritual exemption.
[2:25:06.340 --> 2:25:09.340]  One of the attorneys we're working with is Alan Phillips.
[2:25:09.340 --> 2:25:15.340]  If you go to fluscam.com, you'll see a banner of his book, Vaccination Exemption.
[2:25:15.340 --> 2:25:20.340]  His principal support now and instruction and it's been ours.
[2:25:20.340 --> 2:25:25.340]  I've been advancing the only ministry in the United States that's standing against the federal government
[2:25:25.340 --> 2:25:29.340]  as well as the state of Hawaii on a religious exemption.
[2:25:29.340 --> 2:25:34.340]  It's the only thing that we have available to us that really works for the attorney Phillips.
[2:25:34.340 --> 2:25:40.340]  So you might want to just check out that book. It's an excellent book. It's a download off of fluscam.com.
[2:25:40.340 --> 2:25:47.340]  And he needs to demand the law. There isn't one. Okay? They corner them quietly. They make them take it.
[2:25:47.340 --> 2:25:51.340]  It's absolute tyranny. They can tell their boss, look, just squirt that in the trash can then.
[2:25:51.340 --> 2:25:58.340]  Look, Obama's saying nobody has to take it, but all over they're telling police, firemen and medical workers that they have to take it.
[2:25:58.340 --> 2:26:00.340]  Again, more lies.
[2:26:00.340 --> 2:26:11.340]  Well, again, it's official malfeasance that you have an administrator in a higher position that is compelling you to violate the United States Constitution.
[2:26:11.340 --> 2:26:14.340]  The first and the fifth amendments, you have freedom of religion.
[2:26:14.340 --> 2:26:18.340]  And it says both in Old and New Testament. In fact, here's what I would recommend.
[2:26:18.340 --> 2:26:25.340]  On the publisher's website, tetrahedron.org, Alex, you might want to link to two files.
[2:26:25.340 --> 2:26:34.340]  They're to be stapled and attached to your vaccination exemption form that you must demand from all of these administrators,
[2:26:34.340 --> 2:26:40.340]  from the docs, from the hospitals, from the school administrators, whoever is demanding that you get vaccinated.
[2:26:40.340 --> 2:26:47.340]  Staple a copy of two documents. One is called vaccination, the ungodly practice.
[2:26:47.340 --> 2:26:54.340]  The other is called what Jesus and Moses would say and do about vaccinations and tuberculosis, skin tests.
[2:26:54.340 --> 2:26:59.340]  Those are available in the vaccine folder of tetrahedron.org.
[2:26:59.340 --> 2:27:02.340]  All right, let me stop you, Dr. Horowitz. Let me stop you because I want to get to some of the calls.
[2:27:02.340 --> 2:27:05.340]  Charlie, is this a nurse or somebody you know that works there?
[2:27:05.340 --> 2:27:12.340]  Yes, sir, I do. And as a matter of fact, one of the reasons I called her doesn't look like she's going to be able to get out of it.
[2:27:12.340 --> 2:27:16.340]  She's been here for 15 years, but well, I was going to ask the doctor.
[2:27:16.340 --> 2:27:20.340]  I mean, how do they just order her like a slave to take something?
[2:27:20.340 --> 2:27:24.340]  I mean, can't she say, well, Obama says I don't have to take it.
[2:27:24.340 --> 2:27:29.340]  Can't she go in there on a DVD with a video of the president?
[2:27:29.340 --> 2:27:37.340]  Well, possibly. The reason I was calling is if she can't get out of it, what can she do after the fact that may help her?
[2:27:37.340 --> 2:27:45.340]  If you have to take the shot, does anything need to do to, I don't know, expel it from your body or help to reflect somehow?
[2:27:45.340 --> 2:27:54.340]  The best detoxification, you're talking about now detoxification. We urge people not to get there, but if you have to, if you're forced to,
[2:27:54.340 --> 2:28:02.340]  the best detoxification remedies, I would highly recommend you check out what's on HealthyWorldStore.com.
[2:28:02.340 --> 2:28:09.340]  HealthyWorldStore.com has a product called Zeolite, not Zeolite.
[2:28:09.340 --> 2:28:18.340]  It's a far advanced generation beyond Zeolite, which is a standard medical chelation therapy.
[2:28:18.340 --> 2:28:25.340]  You want Zeolite, Z-O-L-I-S-E dot net is the website.
[2:28:25.340 --> 2:28:32.340]  If you use that, it's the best all around detoxification agent.
[2:28:32.340 --> 2:28:43.340]  And if you also use what's been standard, the Stanley Burroughs Master Cleanser, the alkalinization of the blood, the bentonite clays to remove heavy metals,
[2:28:43.340 --> 2:28:53.340]  these are the types, and then the homeopathics, great homeopathics now, good homeopaths have been developing to help purge the toxins out of your body.
[2:28:53.340 --> 2:28:57.340]  So then there's the bioenergetics, the approaches that have been suppressed.
[2:28:57.340 --> 2:29:06.340]  Like oxysilver.com has been suppressed. They're after all of these alternatives, and they don't want you to have them because they want you to be poised.
[2:29:06.340 --> 2:29:08.340]  Dr. Horowitz, the caller trying to pop in with one final comment.
[2:29:08.340 --> 2:29:11.340]  We're going to come back and jam in a few final calls. We've got to let Dr. Horowitz go.
[2:29:11.340 --> 2:29:13.340]  But what are you trying to say, Charlie?
[2:29:13.340 --> 2:29:21.340]  What I'm trying to say is I'm a longtime listener, and I do have some silver solution, but I can't get it.
[2:29:21.340 --> 2:29:23.340]  That's good to hop. Everybody should.
[2:29:23.340 --> 2:29:31.340]  But let me just say this, because we've got to break. Though Obama says you don't have to take it, he does that to make you feel good.
[2:29:31.340 --> 2:29:39.340]  Then behind the scenes, they're telling school kids, they're telling teachers, they're telling police, they're telling firemen, they're telling nurses, you've got to take it or you're fired.
[2:29:39.340 --> 2:29:45.340]  It's criminal, it's color of law, and for God's sake, it sounds like your wife's already taking it.
[2:29:45.340 --> 2:29:50.340]  But God bless you, sir. We'll be right back, final segment with Dr. Horowitz. Stay with us.
[2:29:50.340 --> 2:29:54.340]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[2:29:54.340 --> 2:29:59.340]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:29:59.340 --> 2:30:04.340]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[2:30:04.340 --> 2:30:06.340]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[2:30:06.340 --> 2:30:15.340]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[2:30:15.340 --> 2:30:20.340]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[2:30:20.340 --> 2:30:22.340]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[2:30:22.340 --> 2:30:29.340]  The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[2:30:29.340 --> 2:30:40.340]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.

[2:30:58.340 --> 2:31:10.340]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat. Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[2:31:10.340 --> 2:31:15.340]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs? You don't have to cooperate. There is a solution.
[2:31:15.340 --> 2:31:31.340]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[2:33:12.340 --> 2:33:39.340]  We're going to have Dr. Horowitz back up for an hour with us tomorrow. We've got another guest coming up in five minutes. I want to quickly go to Craig, Tim, WC, and Bryant, then he'll be back with us tomorrow to talk more about what we know the flu vaccine is doing to people and more on his affidavit calling for criminal investigation.
[2:33:39.340 --> 2:33:47.340]  Just an amazing thing that Dr. Horowitz has done. Craig in New York, you're on the air. Go ahead, Craig.
[2:33:47.340 --> 2:33:53.340]  The swine flu killed about 10 people in America up until May. You know what the count is now?
[2:33:53.340 --> 2:33:55.340]  Close to 1,000.
[2:33:55.340 --> 2:33:57.340]  In America?
[2:33:57.340 --> 2:34:04.340]  They're saying on the media that a couple days ago I saw the number of 800 and something. Doc, what's the best number you've got on that?
[2:34:04.340 --> 2:34:16.340]  I think it's certainly less than 800, but I don't believe any of it. Quite frankly, the flu itself, you can't... How can you say that this particular thing caused this person to die?
[2:34:16.340 --> 2:34:24.340]  What about all of the immune suppressants that they were on? What about their lifestyle? What about all the cold factors associated with someone dying?
[2:34:24.340 --> 2:34:37.340]  It's almost always people that are in bad shape. All the babies and stuff dying have been on heart machines, have been almost dead. Old people that are almost dead. They even admit that 36,000 number every year that die of regular flu is totally blown out of proportion.
[2:34:37.340 --> 2:34:50.340]  Totally. So it's really a complete specious report. And who is it coming from? Rupert Murdoch? Ketterman? Rockefeller cronies who control the mainstream media? So you can't trust it.
[2:34:50.340 --> 2:34:56.340]  I would forget it. I don't worry about stuff like that. And not if you've got all of the alternatives.
[2:34:56.340 --> 2:34:59.340]  Sir, do you have any other points, Craig?
[2:34:59.340 --> 2:35:06.340]  Well, it's just that it was 10 according to MSNBC and the Gardasil vaccine killed 32 and made over 700 seriously ill.
[2:35:06.340 --> 2:35:20.340]  You know, that's a lie. It was much, much more than that. The Gardasil is killing these poor little girls who are taking it. Now they're going to give it to boys. We knew that it would cause cancer. And the other thing is like the swine flu vaccine. Think about this.
[2:35:20.340 --> 2:35:25.340]  They've only got six weeks to test it. Well, what about all the autoimmune diseases and the cancers that take months to cure?
[2:35:25.340 --> 2:35:31.340]  What if they were to say the mega flu outbreak was caused by flu when it's going to be the vaccine?
[2:35:31.340 --> 2:35:39.340]  Exactly. That the vaccines are what's going to be killing people. It's always been this way as long as I've been studying it for 15 years.
[2:35:39.340 --> 2:35:48.340]  Vaccinations are the number one genocidal weapon being used for population reduction by Rockefeller at all.
[2:35:48.340 --> 2:35:51.340]  By the way, I didn't get to this with you, but tomorrow we're going to cover it.
[2:35:51.340 --> 2:36:09.340]  The Times of London billionaire club and bid to curb over population. A secret meeting of Rockefeller, Gates, Warren Buffett, Ted Turner and others involved, including people from news core meeting and secret to decide on a plan to reduce world population.
[2:36:09.340 --> 2:36:18.340]  And it's the same corporation in New York that funded this meeting. And this was in May 24th of this year. Thank you so much.
[2:36:18.340 --> 2:36:25.340]  One more call and I'll get the WC and Brian everybody else flu calls after our next guest leaves us in about 15 minutes who's holding right now.
[2:36:25.340 --> 2:36:29.340]  Let's talk to Tim in Texas. You're on the air with Dr. Lynn Horowitz.
[2:36:29.340 --> 2:36:42.340]  Yeah. Hello, Alex and doc. Back in 1976, I remember getting a flu shot. It was the first time something like that had come out and they obviously didn't know what they know now about the stuff.
[2:36:42.340 --> 2:36:53.340]  A few days after that shot, I got so sick with the flu. I don't even remember 10 days of my life ever since then. I don't remember having the flu.
[2:36:53.340 --> 2:37:04.340]  I know for a fact in the last 15 years, I have not had the flu and it has been all around me. Have I built up a resistance to it? Thanks to that shot back then.
[2:37:04.340 --> 2:37:14.340]  No, actually, you should praise God for the fact that you're still alive. I would say, first of all, 65, maybe 70% of the people who get the flu shot get horrible flu.
[2:37:14.340 --> 2:37:17.340]  And so it's actually causing what it is that's supposed to be.
[2:37:17.340 --> 2:37:23.340]  My mother never got the flu and was sick for months when she took it about a decade ago. Didn't your mother die from a flu shot?
[2:37:23.340 --> 2:37:36.340]  Yes. My mom passed away from Gillian Beret, which the governments of the U.S. and the U.K. have just alerted the neurologists from these countries that they could be aware. They should be aware of skyrocketing cases.
[2:37:36.340 --> 2:37:44.340]  Meanwhile, Reuters in a story Friday says, oh, there's going to be millions of regular deaths after you take the flu. The flu shot didn't do it.
[2:37:44.340 --> 2:37:52.340]  Reuters is mass diagnosing everyone saying there's going to be millions of deaths. But did you see that article, Dr. Horowitz?
[2:37:52.340 --> 2:37:58.340]  I haven't seen that Reuters' new one. But again, Reuters is controlled by the same people.
[2:37:58.340 --> 2:37:59.340]  The British.
[2:37:59.340 --> 2:38:06.340]  Yeah, but Thomas Glosier, check him out. He's one of the Rockefeller partners in New York.
[2:38:06.340 --> 2:38:12.340]  We're going to talk about this more tomorrow. And after the next guest is off, folks, I'm going to go back into that Reuters story.
[2:38:12.340 --> 2:38:17.340]  They're getting everybody ready for deaths and saying it's going to be no big deal. Thank you so much, caller.
[2:38:17.340 --> 2:38:24.340]  Dr. Horowitz, we'll talk to you tomorrow at noon central 10 Pacific. God bless you. Everybody should read your affidavit at fluscam.com.
[2:38:24.340 --> 2:38:27.340]  We also have it linked up on infowars.com. We'll see you tomorrow.
[2:38:27.340 --> 2:38:28.340]  Thanks a lot, Alex. Bye.
[2:38:28.340 --> 2:38:34.340]  Okay, there he goes. And I apologize to Andrew B. Einhorn. We had him earlier set for the start of the show.
[2:38:34.340 --> 2:38:39.340]  But this big flu thing getting bigger and bigger in the news and the talk of forced inoculations.
[2:38:39.340 --> 2:38:43.340]  You heard people calling in with their nurse wife being told she has to take it or she's fired.
[2:38:43.340 --> 2:38:50.340]  That has kind of taken over the news here. I'll be covering that exclusively next hour and continuing with your phone calls.
[2:38:50.340 --> 2:38:57.340]  But right now, Andrew B. Einhorn, an expert in the field of statistics and strategic communications, environmental management, public health.
[2:38:57.340 --> 2:39:03.340]  And I saw him in a piece in Russia today, headline, road police blood test or an act of rape.
[2:39:03.340 --> 2:39:07.340]  Texas passed a law where they don't even need warrants to take your blood.
[2:39:07.340 --> 2:39:13.340]  The feds paid the state to do this. And I wanted to get his take on this. I mean, imagine in World War II,
[2:39:13.340 --> 2:39:19.340]  the Nazis would have had roadside checkpoints taking people's blood under the guise of DWI with no warrant.
[2:39:19.340 --> 2:39:23.340]  This is getting insane. Mr. Einhorn, thanks for coming on with us.
[2:39:23.340 --> 2:39:26.340]  Thanks for having me, Alex. I appreciate the time.
[2:39:26.340 --> 2:39:31.340]  You bet. In your research of this, what was it like to discover this was going on?
[2:39:31.340 --> 2:39:38.340]  It was pretty mind-blowing. I thought we were past the sort of error of the big government, if you will,
[2:39:38.340 --> 2:39:43.340]  at least for the basic practice of the big government. I should amend that.
[2:39:43.340 --> 2:39:51.340]  And as I mentioned in my tutorial, it seems like this is a clear violation of a number of our amendments.
[2:39:51.340 --> 2:39:56.340]  But it's for the good. We've got to stop drunk drivers, even though Prozac drivers are twice as dangerous
[2:39:56.340 --> 2:40:01.340]  and texting drivers are twice as dangerous. But again, oh, we've got to get rid of the Fourth Amendment
[2:40:01.340 --> 2:40:06.340]  and have $15 million fines for garage sales that sell a recall toy or desk.
[2:40:06.340 --> 2:40:11.340]  It's just all about getting the average... Again, tell us what's happening around the country from your research.
[2:40:11.340 --> 2:40:14.340]  How the feds are financing this. What's going on?
[2:40:14.340 --> 2:40:20.340]  It's a pilot program that started about three weeks ago run by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
[2:40:20.340 --> 2:40:26.340]  What they're doing is they're training police officers in Lobotomy and being able to take blood draws
[2:40:26.340 --> 2:40:32.340]  and doing it at station and in mobile flood units. They can call it to the scene of a defected DUI.
[2:40:32.340 --> 2:40:36.340]  Total federalization. Right there is a total violation of the Tenth Amendment.
[2:40:36.340 --> 2:40:42.340]  I think a lot of lawyers would definitely argue that it goes against any self-incrimination law
[2:40:42.340 --> 2:40:46.340]  and a deprivation of property without due process of law.
[2:40:46.340 --> 2:40:49.340]  Property being your blood in this particular incident.
[2:40:49.340 --> 2:40:54.340]  Did you know that if you read the real documents, the older ones, this is a plan for a national DNA registry
[2:40:54.340 --> 2:40:58.340]  just to train you to have the idea of police out taking blood?
[2:40:58.340 --> 2:41:01.340]  I did not. I was not aware of that.
[2:41:01.340 --> 2:41:05.340]  Anyways, go ahead. So the feds are training the locals to take blood. Go ahead.
[2:41:05.340 --> 2:41:09.340]  So the two programs that are happening are taking place in Idaho and Texas
[2:41:09.340 --> 2:41:14.340]  and although a similar program has been going on for about 14 years in Arizona
[2:41:14.340 --> 2:41:21.340]  and believe it or not, two weeks ago the Arizona State Supreme Court ruled this unconstitutional yet.
[2:41:21.340 --> 2:41:29.340]  The fed is going ahead with their pilot program in other states where the state constitution basically was according to the law.
[2:41:29.340 --> 2:41:36.340]  That's right. I first remember seeing this on the air when I first got on air 13 years ago in Tucson, the Daily Star
[2:41:36.340 --> 2:41:41.340]  and my listeners couldn't believe that police were taking blood at checkpoints. Go ahead.
[2:41:41.340 --> 2:41:48.340]  No, it's absolutely crazy. Do you think about the implications of this just merely from a health perspective?
[2:41:48.340 --> 2:41:53.340]  I can make your air on your back stand up in terms of using unsafe needles,
[2:41:53.340 --> 2:42:00.340]  potentially forcibly taking blood, meaning that you have a potential suspect who's thrashing around in their seats
[2:42:00.340 --> 2:42:07.340]  and the officer also being potentially exposed to any blood borne pathogen as well as the suspect who,
[2:42:07.340 --> 2:42:14.340]  you know, and I use that term suspect to mean someone who either may or may not have had any alcohol at that point.
[2:42:14.340 --> 2:42:22.340]  This is really up to the officer's whim to determine what probable cause really means because they do not need a court order to draw your blood.
[2:42:22.340 --> 2:42:30.340]  So it really leaves a lot of power in the hands of a few and anytime we see that, we see potential for a few.
[2:42:30.340 --> 2:42:38.340]  Absolutely. Again, completely unconstitutional. Here in Texas, in fact, let's just play that clip real fast.
[2:42:38.340 --> 2:42:43.340]  Here is a clip of local news saying, yeah, you don't need a warrant anymore.
[2:42:43.340 --> 2:42:47.340]  You don't need a warrant anymore to take blood and then, but it's only the kids in the car.
[2:42:47.340 --> 2:42:49.340]  It's only if you've had a DWI before.
[2:42:49.340 --> 2:42:53.340]  It's only about a year ago it was we're going to have fake rubber stamp warrants.
[2:42:53.340 --> 2:42:59.340]  Now it's no warrants. A year from now it'll be, oh, it's just DNA we're taking just like they do in England. Here it is.
[2:42:59.340 --> 2:43:08.340]  Our top story here on the Nightbeat. A little known law which goes into effect in less than two weeks will allow a lot more blood draws across Texas.
[2:43:08.340 --> 2:43:12.340]  The Nightbeat Shelton Green is live on North Mopak with details. Shelton?
[2:43:12.340 --> 2:43:23.340]  Tyler, starting September the 1st, police across Texas won't need a search warrant to draw blood from people involved in one of three situations after a crash.
[2:43:23.340 --> 2:43:32.340]  Number one, if you injure someone in that crash or number two, if you have prior DWIs or number three, if you have a child in your car at the time of the crash.
[2:43:32.340 --> 2:43:36.340]  So in other words, blood can be drawn even if you're not suspected of driving.
[2:43:36.340 --> 2:43:42.340]  That's enough. No more warrants in America. It's just a positive piece for it.
[2:43:42.340 --> 2:43:48.340]  And the feds are financing this. A total violation of state law. Go ahead, Mr. Einhorn.
[2:43:48.340 --> 2:44:00.340]  I absolutely agree on this one. As I mentioned before, it's a clear disconnect between what people are really wanting and hoping to do and that's getting drunk drivers off the road.
[2:44:00.340 --> 2:44:11.340]  And the reality of the situation and how a program would be executed and all the potential for problems outside, of course, of simply the legal argument that it's illegal.
[2:44:11.340 --> 2:44:19.340]  And I can't imagine that this would go on for too long. I think if we all do our jobs as journalists, it shouldn't.
[2:44:19.340 --> 2:44:25.340]  But, you know, it's sort of one of those unbelievable scratch your head type cases, what are you thinking?
[2:44:25.340 --> 2:44:36.340]  And, you know, if you go and there's a really long account on OhMyGov, they responded to the editorial from someone who responds, traumatized in Texas.
[2:44:36.340 --> 2:44:41.340]  And they give the account where, you know, on September 4th, they went through this whole process.
[2:44:41.340 --> 2:44:58.340]  And it was a woman talking about how she had one glass of wine that night and watched as all her personal rights were stripped from her and she was put in prison and she was grabbed and forcibly stuck with a needle all without knowing what was going on.
[2:44:58.340 --> 2:45:04.340]  And horrified as eight police officers and staff sat around and laughed and thought that it was funny.
[2:45:04.340 --> 2:45:13.340]  Well, and this is training police to be medical officers for forced inoculations, for quarantines, for extracting DNA.
[2:45:13.340 --> 2:45:21.340]  Did you know for 36 years in the United States, England, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, it's an international secret agreement now declassified.
[2:45:21.340 --> 2:45:27.340]  It's been in the Austin, America statesmen. Blood is taken secretly at birth from babies and put in a DNA database.
[2:45:27.340 --> 2:45:29.340]  I guess they're guilty of driving too.
[2:45:29.340 --> 2:45:32.340]  I haven't heard that. I'd love to read something about it.
[2:45:32.340 --> 2:45:37.340]  This is a larger program to get medicalized police out there at checkpoints.
[2:45:37.340 --> 2:45:39.340]  And now you've got your kids with you.
[2:45:39.340 --> 2:45:49.340]  Now they take you to jail for not wearing seatbelts in Austin and in surrounding areas and CPS your kids for you not wearing a seatbelt, even if it's in your neighborhood.
[2:45:49.340 --> 2:45:53.340]  And then they take your kids on the spot and then try to keep them.
[2:45:53.340 --> 2:46:03.340]  That's the news to me. Did you hear about the $15 million fines for selling anything with lead in it or that's been recalled at a garage sale?
[2:46:03.340 --> 2:46:12.340]  No, I haven't yet. I'm not kidding. Guys, pull up the Fox News article. It's also AP. Absolutely.
[2:46:12.340 --> 2:46:16.340]  In fact, I covered it last night. It's here in my stack.
[2:46:16.340 --> 2:46:19.340]  Well, tell us about your website omigov.com.
[2:46:19.340 --> 2:46:30.340]  Sure. Omigov is a government news provider that exposes the good and bad that's happening within the federal workforce and the federal government.
[2:46:30.340 --> 2:46:35.340]  We have a very specific focus of trying to find the things that work and the things that are broken.
[2:46:35.340 --> 2:46:40.340]  This particular story obviously fits into the latter category of things that are broken.
[2:46:40.340 --> 2:46:49.340]  And we have a little bit of a humorous bent to keep things moving along at a, you know, quite the faster pace with some of the issues that we come across.
[2:46:49.340 --> 2:46:55.340]  There's certainly less than 20 and I think this one fits that category.
[2:46:55.340 --> 2:47:01.340]  Well, where is this going? I mean, from your research and perspective, are they?
[2:47:01.340 --> 2:47:09.340]  I predict they won't even stop taking blood warrantlessly at checkpoints because I'd seen other state rulings in Arizona previously over the years and they don't stop.
[2:47:09.340 --> 2:47:11.340]  And they've expanded taking blood.
[2:47:11.340 --> 2:47:18.340]  Well, I think the problem or the core of the problem goes back to 1966, which is the Supreme Court ruling deemed it constitutional.
[2:47:18.340 --> 2:47:25.340]  So long as the blood draw was based on a probable cause and that the suspect wasn't that intoxicated.
[2:47:25.340 --> 2:47:30.340]  You know, that it was done after the wrath and it was executed in a medically approved manner.
[2:47:30.340 --> 2:47:34.340]  Problem is, all those things are really pushed to the envelope of their definition.
[2:47:34.340 --> 2:47:37.340]  What is a medically approved manner?
[2:47:37.340 --> 2:47:43.340]  And the doctors have, and nurses have been refusing to take the blood without a warrant.
[2:47:43.340 --> 2:47:51.340]  And so how can we medically approved are the, are the, is a police officer now a medically degreed MD?
[2:47:51.340 --> 2:47:55.340]  Of course not. And they go through a week and a half of training for this.
[2:47:55.340 --> 2:48:06.340]  And, you know, anyone who's been to the hospital or even a doctor's office and had a blood draw known that, you know, a nurse with 15 years of experience might still pick up three, four, five times before they grab a vein.
[2:48:06.340 --> 2:48:19.340]  And this is someone who's been training for a week and a half, how after they actually going to be on all the different procedures on the latest, you know, techniques and keeping the needles clean and properly labeling your blood sample.
[2:48:19.340 --> 2:48:22.340]  So when it goes off to the lab, comes back for analysis.
[2:48:22.340 --> 2:48:25.340]  Oh yeah, these are the police famous for framing people.
[2:48:25.340 --> 2:48:30.340]  I wonder if I can go to the police to get my appendix out now since they're, since they're medical doctors.
[2:48:30.340 --> 2:48:33.340]  Well, they'd be cheaper if the federal government's funding it, right?
[2:48:33.340 --> 2:48:42.340]  Mr. Einhorn, here's the article new government policy imposes strict standards on garage sales.
[2:48:42.340 --> 2:48:49.340]  Violators caught selling anything on the enormous list face fines of up to $100,000 per infraction up to 15 million.
[2:48:49.340 --> 2:48:52.340]  Her related series of infractions two years in prison.
[2:48:52.340 --> 2:48:54.340]  How's that sound?
[2:48:54.340 --> 2:48:56.340]  No, it sounds terrible.
[2:48:56.340 --> 2:49:00.340]  It's just sort of more of the same, you know, the same token here.
[2:49:00.340 --> 2:49:06.340]  The stuff keeps coming out and I think I sort of wonder where, where it originally on the back of someone's brain.
[2:49:06.340 --> 2:49:08.340]  It's a good idea.
[2:49:08.340 --> 2:49:14.340]  But along the way, there should be a number of people that stand up and tell them that this is not right.
[2:49:14.340 --> 2:49:16.340]  That this is unconstitutional.
[2:49:16.340 --> 2:49:18.340]  That this is simply a bad idea.
[2:49:18.340 --> 2:49:24.340]  That this is going to be problematic and ultimately this is going to make you look foolish as the story comes out.
[2:49:24.340 --> 2:49:25.340]  Absolutely.
[2:49:25.340 --> 2:49:29.340]  Well, Mr. Einhorn, we appreciate your work at omigov.com.
[2:49:29.340 --> 2:49:34.340]  And anytime you got anything you think is interesting, email us or send your story over.
[2:49:34.340 --> 2:49:35.340]  We'll link to it.
[2:49:35.340 --> 2:49:38.340]  And we appreciate you going on Russia today and speaking out against this.
[2:49:38.340 --> 2:49:41.340]  The Russians are more free than us in many respects now.
[2:49:41.340 --> 2:49:51.340]  And but the good news is I think the people are starting to really wake up that we're in trouble and that a serious police state is being set up by the feds and the private corporations that have taken over the federal government.
[2:49:51.340 --> 2:49:54.340]  Do you see people starting to wake up or what's your take on that?
[2:49:54.340 --> 2:50:04.340]  I certainly see a lot more people getting involved in government and getting more active and following and tracking the various stories that are happening.
[2:50:04.340 --> 2:50:21.340]  But I think that there's still a degree of naivete among people that they don't really realize that sometimes people's personal interests are not put the same level as those interests on the national level or political interests.
[2:50:21.340 --> 2:50:30.340]  And despite scandal after scandal, we see a lot of faith that remains in the hands of those with the power.
[2:50:30.340 --> 2:50:35.340]  And sometimes with that power is unchecked, problems will arise.
[2:50:35.340 --> 2:50:36.340]  Yeah, it certainly would.
[2:50:36.340 --> 2:50:38.340]  So we better get fired up serious about it.
[2:50:38.340 --> 2:50:41.340]  Andrew Einhorn, thanks for joining us.
[2:50:41.340 --> 2:50:42.340]  I appreciate your time.
[2:50:42.340 --> 2:50:43.340]  You bet.
[2:50:43.340 --> 2:50:44.340]  Take care, buddy.
[2:50:44.340 --> 2:50:45.340]  All right.
[2:50:45.340 --> 2:50:46.340]  I'm going to cover flu.
[2:50:46.340 --> 2:50:47.340]  I want to hear from police.
[2:50:47.340 --> 2:50:49.340]  I want to hear from military.
[2:50:49.340 --> 2:50:55.340]  I want to hear from that fellow whose wife's a nurse here in Texas at Seaton saying you got to take the shot or you're fired.
[2:50:55.340 --> 2:50:58.340]  I thought Lord Obama said nobody has to take it.
[2:50:58.340 --> 2:51:01.340]  If he tells you one thing, it's the other.
[2:51:01.340 --> 2:51:04.340]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[2:51:04.340 --> 2:51:08.340]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[2:51:08.340 --> 2:51:13.340]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[2:51:13.340 --> 2:51:19.340]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[2:51:19.340 --> 2:51:24.340]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[2:51:24.340 --> 2:51:27.340]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[2:51:27.340 --> 2:51:32.340]  Run some pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[2:51:32.340 --> 2:51:38.340]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[2:51:38.340 --> 2:51:41.340]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[2:51:41.340 --> 2:51:44.340]  Solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[2:51:44.340 --> 2:51:48.340]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today.
[2:51:48.340 --> 2:51:55.340]  That's MySolarBackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[2:51:55.340 --> 2:51:59.340]  877-327-0365.

[2:53:12.340 --> 2:53:18.340]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.

[2:54:44.340 --> 2:54:49.340]  But then Obama is separately saying, don't worry, don't have to take the shot.
[2:54:49.340 --> 2:54:52.340]  Everything he's ever said is a complete lie.
[2:54:52.340 --> 2:54:57.340]  Bill Clinton was a big liar, but nothing like this. George Bush didn't really, he lied about a lot of stuff,
[2:54:57.340 --> 2:55:00.340]  but more often than not, just threw it in your face. Total deception.

[3:00:18.340 --> 3:00:21.340]  We're going to go to Brian Sue, Michael, Ruth, Andy, and many others,
[3:00:21.340 --> 3:00:26.340]  toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[3:00:26.340 --> 3:00:28.340]  Got a lot of other flu news I'm going to be going over.
[3:00:28.340 --> 3:00:34.340]  I want to hear specifically from you about if your nurses or doctors or medical workers
[3:00:34.340 --> 3:00:36.340]  or police in different areas were getting the calls,
[3:00:36.340 --> 3:00:38.340]  they're being ordered to take it.
[3:00:38.340 --> 3:00:42.340]  Some cities and hospitals have ordered their employees to take it, but with no law,
[3:00:42.340 --> 3:00:45.340]  can they order you if you work there to take the shots?
[3:00:45.340 --> 3:00:48.340]  This is really criminal. What's happening?
[3:00:48.340 --> 3:00:51.340]  Let's go to Brian in New York or on the air, Brian.
[3:00:51.340 --> 3:00:54.340]  Hi, how's it going, Alex? Actually, I'm in Montreal.
[3:00:54.340 --> 3:00:56.340]  Okay, we'll go ahead.
[3:00:56.340 --> 3:00:58.340]  I just wanted to mention a few things.
[3:00:58.340 --> 3:01:02.340]  First, I'm very thankful that Dr. Horowitz came out with his affidavit,
[3:01:02.340 --> 3:01:05.340]  because when he talked with you in April, I recorded that,
[3:01:05.340 --> 3:01:08.340]  and I went and did my research afterwards.
[3:01:08.340 --> 3:01:12.340]  And in May on the Site 12160, I posted the article of vaccines,
[3:01:12.340 --> 3:01:16.340]  the who, Dr. Robertson, and the world's collective death sentence.
[3:01:16.340 --> 3:01:20.340]  Now that Dr. Robertson has come out with his affidavit,
[3:01:20.340 --> 3:01:23.340]  he's backed up everything I had in my article.
[3:01:23.340 --> 3:01:26.340]  So all the doubters and all the people that were laughing at me
[3:01:26.340 --> 3:01:28.340]  and thought that I was insane and had the wrong idea,
[3:01:28.340 --> 3:01:31.340]  now they're going to have to take their foot out of their mouth.
[3:01:31.340 --> 3:01:34.340]  Brian, I hear you, but I don't even really remember what you're talking about.
[3:01:34.340 --> 3:01:37.340]  So I certainly didn't say, I don't remember the article.
[3:01:37.340 --> 3:01:41.340]  Sometimes we don't link to things early on, even if we think it may be true.
[3:01:41.340 --> 3:01:45.340]  If we can't prove it, now that more and more is coming out about this,
[3:01:45.340 --> 3:01:49.340]  and as we have more and more evidence in his major German newspapers
[3:01:49.340 --> 3:01:52.340]  report on a lot of this, we can cover it.
[3:01:52.340 --> 3:01:55.340]  I mean, I have to be careful what we do and don't cover here,
[3:01:55.340 --> 3:01:59.340]  but I appreciate you, Brian. Sue in Florida, you're on the air.
[3:01:59.340 --> 3:02:01.340]  Hi, Alex. It's good to talk to you.
[3:02:01.340 --> 3:02:02.340]  Good to talk to you.
[3:02:02.340 --> 3:02:04.340]  I'm not one of the workers that you said,
[3:02:04.340 --> 3:02:09.340]  but I do have advice for people who may feel that they have to go along with shots.
[3:02:09.340 --> 3:02:14.340]  My understanding from some research is that if people do consent
[3:02:14.340 --> 3:02:21.340]  rather than exercise their right to refuse, they should request single dose vials
[3:02:21.340 --> 3:02:24.340]  that have no mercury in them of the vaccine.
[3:02:24.340 --> 3:02:28.340]  Do not accept a vaccine that comes from multi-dose vials.
[3:02:28.340 --> 3:02:35.340]  Well, a lot of people have been demanding the non-themerosol, non-adjuvant shots,
[3:02:35.340 --> 3:02:37.340]  and they're being told they don't exist.
[3:02:37.340 --> 3:02:42.340]  Well, they do exist, and a person can get online, askdoctorsears.com
[3:02:42.340 --> 3:02:46.340]  or other sites, I'm sure, to find out which companies offer which vaccines.
[3:02:46.340 --> 3:02:47.340]  Okay.
[3:02:47.340 --> 3:02:49.340]  Ask Dr. Sears for sure how that information.
[3:02:49.340 --> 3:02:51.340]  He uses vaccines.
[3:02:51.340 --> 3:02:55.340]  Of course, we also recommend Dr. Tenpenny's site who does not recommend vaccines.
[3:02:55.340 --> 3:02:59.340]  All very excellent information and concerns expressed on both sites.
[3:02:59.340 --> 3:03:04.340]  Ironically, some of the concerns are the same about mass vaccination and so on,
[3:03:04.340 --> 3:03:07.340]  but people do need to insist that they have the single dose.
[3:03:07.340 --> 3:03:11.340]  Also, there's an interesting fact on government websites regarding their purchasing
[3:03:11.340 --> 3:03:13.340]  in May and July.
[3:03:13.340 --> 3:03:17.340]  $700 million worth or so of adjuvant was ordered,
[3:03:17.340 --> 3:03:21.340]  and yet if you visit the CDC website, question and answer section,
[3:03:21.340 --> 3:03:23.340]  will adjuvant be in our vaccines?
[3:03:23.340 --> 3:03:25.340]  The answer is no.
[3:03:25.340 --> 3:03:28.340]  So I'm concerned for our brothers and sisters in other parts of the world.
[3:03:28.340 --> 3:03:29.340]  Okay.
[3:03:29.340 --> 3:03:30.340]  Good to hear from you, Sue.
[3:03:30.340 --> 3:03:31.340]  We're taking calls quickly.
[3:03:31.340 --> 3:03:32.340]  Thank you.
[3:03:32.340 --> 3:03:33.340]  I want to be clear.
[3:03:33.340 --> 3:03:38.340]  I really want to hear at 1-800-259-9231,
[3:03:38.340 --> 3:03:41.340]  not just flu calls in your comment, your take, what you think is happening,
[3:03:41.340 --> 3:03:46.340]  but from police, military, firemen, medical workers, people that are being ordered to take it
[3:03:46.340 --> 3:03:48.340]  or hearing they may be ordered to take it,
[3:03:48.340 --> 3:03:51.340]  or any news on quarantines which are openly being announced.
[3:03:51.340 --> 3:03:54.340]  Also coming up, Verichip granted exclusive license
[3:03:54.340 --> 3:04:00.340]  for patients used in virus triage detention system H1N1 virus.
[3:04:00.340 --> 3:04:02.340]  I'm going to cover this when we come back briefly.
[3:04:02.340 --> 3:04:07.340]  Then I'm going to just rapid fire through your calls with Michelle,
[3:04:07.340 --> 3:04:12.340]  Ruth, Andy, Steve, and others, 1-800-259-9231.
[3:04:12.340 --> 3:04:16.340]  Now, our phone system here takes unlimited calls and take hundreds.
[3:04:16.340 --> 3:04:19.340]  The Genesis system has six lines.
[3:04:19.340 --> 3:04:23.340]  What I may do, we got somebody in there to take calls and screen them
[3:04:23.340 --> 3:04:27.340]  because I am going to screen them today to make sure not your content other than
[3:04:27.340 --> 3:04:30.340]  what you're calling about, are you a whistleblower?

[3:07:23.340 --> 3:07:31.340]  So, MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years and he is passionate about turning other people
[3:07:31.340 --> 3:07:35.340]  on to the joys and benefits of working for themselves and not for others.
[3:07:35.340 --> 3:07:40.340]  MZ wants to tell you about a low-cost home business opportunity involving the marketing
[3:07:40.340 --> 3:07:44.340]  of healthful dark chocolate that can help people lose weight and set you up with an impressive
[3:07:44.340 --> 3:07:46.340]  compounding monthly income.

[3:07:53.340 --> 3:07:57.340]  It takes very little money and if you're interested, MZ wants to talk to you.
[3:07:57.340 --> 3:08:00.340]  Remember, chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[3:08:01.340 --> 3:08:04.340]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[3:08:04.340 --> 3:08:08.340]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:08:08.340 --> 3:08:24.340]  Applied Digital Solutions, the very chip company, has now weighed into all of this.
[3:08:24.340 --> 3:08:32.340]  They've tried to get legislation passed in states to make Alzheimer patients take the chip.
[3:08:32.340 --> 3:08:37.340]  They did a deal with the Bureau of Prisons in California to chip prisoners and parolees.
[3:08:37.340 --> 3:08:40.340]  That was in Reuters about seven years ago.
[3:08:40.340 --> 3:08:43.340]  People got really upset and that got canceled.
[3:08:43.340 --> 3:08:48.340]  They've done deals with upscale nightclubs to get into the VIP champagne rooms with the women.
[3:08:48.340 --> 3:08:50.340]  You've got to take a chip.
[3:08:50.340 --> 3:08:56.340]  They've done everything they can to push this and their stock is up over 100%.
[3:08:56.340 --> 3:08:59.340]  It's more than doubled today on this news.
[3:08:59.340 --> 3:09:07.340]  Verichip Corporation, NASDAQ chip, is their name, the NASDAQ name, and its developer partner,
[3:09:07.340 --> 3:09:13.340]  Receptors LLC announced today that Verichip has been granted an exclusive license
[3:09:13.340 --> 3:09:22.340]  to Receptors patent number 7,504,364, titled Methods of Making Arrays
[3:09:22.340 --> 3:09:27.340]  and Artificial Receptors and patent number 7,469,076.
[3:09:27.340 --> 3:09:36.340]  Sensor is employing combinational artificial receptors or combinational
[3:09:36.340 --> 3:09:43.340]  artificial receptors in their application to the development of the virus triage detection system
[3:09:43.340 --> 3:09:45.340]  for the H1N1 virus.
[3:09:45.340 --> 3:09:50.340]  The patents can also be applied to detection systems for other viruses and biological threats
[3:09:50.340 --> 3:09:57.340]  such as resistant strephilococcus bacteria.
[3:09:57.340 --> 3:10:03.340]  So this is the medical tyranny where everybody's going to have to have a chip
[3:10:03.340 --> 3:10:09.340]  and that's in one of the four health care bills to make people on government health care
[3:10:09.340 --> 3:10:13.340]  and to have the federal government finance people having a medical chip that accesses
[3:10:13.340 --> 3:10:18.340]  and has your history on it and also accesses bigger, more detailed medical histories.
[3:10:18.340 --> 3:10:22.340]  And this is the new medical tyranny, the new martial law tyranny.
[3:10:22.340 --> 3:10:27.340]  First they stage terror attacks, blaming on right wing domestic patriots in 95 to set up their grid.
[3:10:27.340 --> 3:10:30.340]  Then they stage 9-11 to say it's oh, just men in a cave.
[3:10:30.340 --> 3:10:33.340]  We're going to set up Homeland Security and put troops on the streets to stop them.
[3:10:33.340 --> 3:10:37.340]  Then their internal reports come out and they say, oh, this is really for the American people.
[3:10:37.340 --> 3:10:42.340]  This is really for gun owners, conservatives, anti-federal reserve protesters.
[3:10:42.340 --> 3:10:46.340]  This whole police state grid is for the American people.
[3:10:46.340 --> 3:10:52.340]  And now triage means, in fact, let's pull up the definition of triage, definition of triage.
[3:10:52.340 --> 3:11:00.340]  But a paraphrase of the definition, we'll see if I'm completely accurate, is the practice of cutting losses.
[3:11:00.340 --> 3:11:03.340]  The practice is saying we got a thousand people that are hurt.
[3:11:03.340 --> 3:11:07.340]  We've only got the medical systems to help 500.
[3:11:07.340 --> 3:11:12.340]  We're just going to completely not treat the other 500 and give everything to the 500 we choose.
[3:11:12.340 --> 3:11:17.340]  This is the basic shift from the Hippocratic oath of do no harm that they haven't given in more than 12 years
[3:11:17.340 --> 3:11:23.340]  to medical students that are graduating as doctors and health care providers of Hippocrates.
[3:11:23.340 --> 3:11:30.340]  They are now shifting from that to the new bioethics eugenical system of where the medical system
[3:11:30.340 --> 3:11:35.340]  and the government decides who gets care and they decide that they're going to ration the care.
[3:11:35.340 --> 3:11:40.340]  Just like the cover of Newsweek, the case for killing granny.
[3:11:40.340 --> 3:11:45.340]  Here's the definition of triage, the sorting and allocation of treatment to patients
[3:11:45.340 --> 3:11:51.340]  and especially battle and disaster victims according to a system of priorities designed to maximize the number of survivors.
[3:11:51.340 --> 3:11:56.340]  The sorting of patients as an emergency room according to the urgency of their need for care.
[3:11:56.340 --> 3:12:00.340]  But when they talk about triage in the case of flu, it means don't treat these people treat those.
[3:12:00.340 --> 3:12:02.340]  That's in the World Health Organization definition.
[3:12:02.340 --> 3:12:08.340]  The assisting a priority order to projects on the basis of where funds and other resources can be best used
[3:12:08.340 --> 3:12:11.340]  and are most needed and are most likely to achieve success.
[3:12:11.340 --> 3:12:13.340]  So there's your definition of triage.
[3:12:13.340 --> 3:12:18.340]  So this is a triage chip deciding if you're in good with the globalist, are you going to be given treatment
[3:12:18.340 --> 3:12:20.340]  or are you not going to be given treatment?
[3:12:20.340 --> 3:12:25.340]  What does Reflections and Warnings, my new film there in Russo cover?
[3:12:25.340 --> 3:12:31.340]  How Nick Rockefeller told him the elites will have a chip, get out of jail free card above the law.
[3:12:31.340 --> 3:12:36.340]  Now, 900, almost a million, it's 900,000 two years ago.
[3:12:36.340 --> 3:12:38.340]  I'm sure it's over a million now.
[3:12:38.340 --> 3:12:43.340]  Get special license plates, government workers, police in California where they can run toll roads.
[3:12:43.340 --> 3:12:44.340]  The police can't run their plates.
[3:12:44.340 --> 3:12:47.340]  They get let go from DWIs.
[3:12:47.340 --> 3:12:48.340]  This is Orange County Register.
[3:12:48.340 --> 3:12:50.340]  This is mainstream news.
[3:12:50.340 --> 3:12:53.340]  It's the same thing as the chip with the license plate reading systems.
[3:12:53.340 --> 3:12:59.340]  They can't read the private plates of government, state, federal and local workers.
[3:12:59.340 --> 3:13:00.340]  So that's what this is going to be.
[3:13:00.340 --> 3:13:04.340]  A chip proving you're a good globalist, a chip proving you're allowed to buy and sell.
[3:13:04.340 --> 3:13:09.340]  They're saying under Homeland Security, if you haven't paid your taxes or have bad debts,
[3:13:09.340 --> 3:13:11.340]  you're going to be put on the no fly, no gun buy list.
[3:13:11.340 --> 3:13:16.340]  So no judge, no jury, you're just put on list and you've got to take a chip to prove you're good.
[3:13:16.340 --> 3:13:18.340]  And if your chip doesn't work, they just turn it off.
[3:13:18.340 --> 3:13:20.340]  How would they sell giving us a chip?
[3:13:20.340 --> 3:13:25.340]  For more than a decade, I've told you through medical emergencies and pandemics,
[3:13:25.340 --> 3:13:28.340]  and now their stock has doubled today.
[3:13:28.340 --> 3:13:30.340]  In fact, they probably brought it into me because I asked for it.
[3:13:30.340 --> 3:13:34.340]  Did you print me the NASDAQ?
[3:13:34.340 --> 3:13:36.340]  Because everybody ran in here and was showing it to me.
[3:13:36.340 --> 3:13:42.340]  Let's pull up NASDAQ and go into the listing of stocks under NASDAQ chip.
[3:13:42.340 --> 3:13:46.340]  Chip is the name of the product.
[3:13:46.340 --> 3:13:53.340]  Chip is what Verichip goes under on the NASDAQ because I'm told it's over 100%, but I want to...
[3:13:53.340 --> 3:13:54.340]  There it is.
[3:13:54.340 --> 3:13:55.340]  There's chip.
[3:13:55.340 --> 3:14:01.340]  And yes, look at it today.
[3:14:01.340 --> 3:14:17.340]  It has gone from an open of $1.75 to $3.26 or a 200%.
[3:14:17.340 --> 3:14:29.340]  It says it's an increase of $2.
[3:14:29.340 --> 3:14:37.340]  180% increase in value right there on your screen for the chip.
[3:14:37.340 --> 3:14:42.340]  All right, I'm going to your phone calls and I want to explain something.
[3:14:42.340 --> 3:14:45.340]  We have the Genesis phone lines and then we have our phone lines.
[3:14:45.340 --> 3:14:48.340]  In fact, I've got...
[3:14:48.340 --> 3:14:50.340]  Pardon me?
[3:14:50.340 --> 3:14:55.340]  John in Virginia, you're up first and Michael, Ruth, Steve, Julio, Joe and others.
[3:14:55.340 --> 3:14:57.340]  Go ahead, sir.
[3:14:57.340 --> 3:14:58.340]  Alex.
[3:14:58.340 --> 3:15:00.340]  Yes, sir.
[3:15:00.340 --> 3:15:04.340]  My wife is a nurse here in Richmond, Virginia.
[3:15:04.340 --> 3:15:07.340]  She's been a nurse for 18 years now.
[3:15:07.340 --> 3:15:11.340]  She's actually a supervisor now.
[3:15:11.340 --> 3:15:21.340]  Pretty much a whole E.R. department and she's been actually in the meetings when they've
[3:15:21.340 --> 3:15:28.340]  been told that they are going to have to take the shots and they've already started making
[3:15:28.340 --> 3:15:31.340]  the regular flu shot this year mandatory.
[3:15:31.340 --> 3:15:37.340]  And they've also told them as soon as the H1N1 comes down that those are going to be
[3:15:37.340 --> 3:15:39.340]  mandatory as well.
[3:15:39.340 --> 3:15:44.340]  Well, a month ago we saw articles in New York where they were ordering nurses to take it
[3:15:44.340 --> 3:15:48.340]  and the headline was 50 plus percent say no to the vaccine.
[3:15:48.340 --> 3:15:54.340]  But Obama is saying you don't have to take it and that that's a lie that people are lying.
[3:15:54.340 --> 3:15:58.340]  Just like we're lying with the hard lobbyist or we're lying, he's increasing troops or
[3:15:58.340 --> 3:15:59.340]  we're lying.
[3:15:59.340 --> 3:16:01.340]  No, he's lying.
[3:16:01.340 --> 3:16:07.340]  But the issue here is they've got the nurses all isolated by themselves being told they've
[3:16:07.340 --> 3:16:09.340]  got to take it with no law.
[3:16:09.340 --> 3:16:12.340]  But then the nurses aren't standing up and speaking out so the public doesn't even know
[3:16:12.340 --> 3:16:13.340]  this is begun.
[3:16:13.340 --> 3:16:16.340]  But if they're going to try to force medical workers, they're clearly going to try to
[3:16:16.340 --> 3:16:17.340]  force the general public.
[3:16:17.340 --> 3:16:18.340]  What is she saying?
[3:16:18.340 --> 3:16:19.340]  Is she going wait?
[3:16:19.340 --> 3:16:22.340]  Obama says I don't have to.
[3:16:22.340 --> 3:16:25.340]  Well, she's not taking it.
[3:16:25.340 --> 3:16:28.340]  She's found a way around it.
[3:16:28.340 --> 3:16:36.340]  Luckily, like I said, she's a supervisor and she's found kind of a way around it.
[3:16:36.340 --> 3:16:41.340]  And tell us the way she got around it because we had a guy with his wife who's a nurse here
[3:16:41.340 --> 3:16:45.340]  in Austin saying that she's been ordered to take it or she's fired.
[3:16:45.340 --> 3:16:46.340]  Right.
[3:16:46.340 --> 3:16:51.340]  They've done the same thing, but she's found a way to...
[3:16:51.340 --> 3:16:53.340]  Because it's fraudulent color of law.
[3:16:53.340 --> 3:16:56.340]  Of course, if she stands her ground, they know they're going to have a lawsuit on their
[3:16:56.340 --> 3:16:58.340]  hands if they force her to do it.
[3:16:58.340 --> 3:17:01.340]  I mean, sir, do you see the outrageous precedent?
[3:17:01.340 --> 3:17:03.340]  They're saying you've got to take the flu shot now.
[3:17:03.340 --> 3:17:05.340]  You've got to take the other shot now.
[3:17:05.340 --> 3:17:07.340]  This is getting ready to make everybody take it.
[3:17:07.340 --> 3:17:10.340]  And it's not only just the nurses.
[3:17:10.340 --> 3:17:13.340]  I'm a former professional firefighter.
[3:17:13.340 --> 3:17:14.340]  Luckily, I'm out of it now.
[3:17:14.340 --> 3:17:16.340]  I'm out on the road driving a truck.
[3:17:16.340 --> 3:17:19.340]  I listen to you all the time, by the way.
[3:17:19.340 --> 3:17:25.340]  But the local fire departments and Richmond and Richmond and all the surrounding areas
[3:17:25.340 --> 3:17:29.340]  have all received basically the same marching orders.
[3:17:29.340 --> 3:17:32.340]  They've all made the flu shot this year mandatory.
[3:17:32.340 --> 3:17:39.340]  And just like I said, as soon as I get the H1N1, they're making that mandatory as well.
[3:17:39.340 --> 3:17:44.340]  I've still got a ton of friends in the fire department, and they've all told me the same thing.
[3:17:44.340 --> 3:17:45.340]  Yeah.
[3:17:45.340 --> 3:17:49.340]  Well, we've talked to police and they've said they've been told not to tell anybody,
[3:17:49.340 --> 3:17:51.340]  but that they are being told they're going to have to take it,
[3:17:51.340 --> 3:17:53.340]  and they're probably going to, quote, make the public take it.
[3:17:53.340 --> 3:17:58.340]  Under level six, we're already under this official UN edict that we have to take it
[3:17:58.340 --> 3:17:59.340]  if they decide we do.
[3:17:59.340 --> 3:18:02.340]  And the troops are training for quarantines, you name it.
[3:18:02.340 --> 3:18:04.340]  This doesn't look good.
[3:18:04.340 --> 3:18:08.340]  And they were told not to tell anybody also.
[3:18:08.340 --> 3:18:09.340]  So there you go.
[3:18:09.340 --> 3:18:12.340]  The government engaging in sneaky evil with Obama saying,
[3:18:12.340 --> 3:18:13.340]  everything's all right.
[3:18:13.340 --> 3:18:16.340]  You don't have to take it while they're gearing up.
[3:18:16.340 --> 3:18:18.340]  That's right.
[3:18:18.340 --> 3:18:20.340]  Well, thank you for your time.
[3:18:20.340 --> 3:18:24.340]  I just wanted to let you know that I mean, and the people that don't believe it, it is going on.
[3:18:24.340 --> 3:18:30.340]  Sir, can you get your wife without her name just to write up and every other nurse to
[3:18:30.340 --> 3:18:32.340]  writersandinfowars.com?
[3:18:32.340 --> 3:18:35.340]  I'll make sure my guys get that, give it to Kurt Nemo and Paul.
[3:18:35.340 --> 3:18:37.340]  We'll take your letters.
[3:18:37.340 --> 3:18:42.340]  We were sent, it's printed off here like a month ago from a mail nurse in New York where
[3:18:42.340 --> 3:18:45.340]  there was the letter saying they've got to take it and it's coming up.
[3:18:45.340 --> 3:18:47.340]  We need to, I've got so much info.
[3:18:47.340 --> 3:18:53.340]  The point is this is happening and we can't get the general public to realize they're really gearing up for this.
[3:18:53.340 --> 3:18:55.340]  Yeah, I can definitely do it.
[3:18:55.340 --> 3:18:58.340]  And she actually found out about it.
[3:18:58.340 --> 3:19:01.340]  I want to say three weeks to a month ago.
[3:19:01.340 --> 3:19:04.340]  Yeah, that's when the feds started having them quietly do it.
[3:19:04.340 --> 3:19:05.340]  God bless you, sir.
[3:19:05.340 --> 3:19:07.340]  Anything else?
[3:19:07.340 --> 3:19:08.340]  No, sir.
[3:19:08.340 --> 3:19:09.340]  Have a great day, Alex.
[3:19:09.340 --> 3:19:11.340]  Thank you.
[3:19:11.340 --> 3:19:12.340]  All right.
[3:19:12.340 --> 3:19:16.340]  We've got Joe in Long Island whose wife's a nurse on the Genesis phone system.
[3:19:16.340 --> 3:19:18.340]  We're going to come back to Joe.
[3:19:18.340 --> 3:19:22.340]  I'm going to get a clear list for the callers on our end.
[3:19:22.340 --> 3:19:24.340]  And we're going to continue.
[3:19:24.340 --> 3:19:25.340]  I mean, this is incredible.
[3:19:25.340 --> 3:19:28.340]  But do you see the military tactic of Obama and the media?
[3:19:28.340 --> 3:19:29.340]  This is what they always do.
[3:19:29.340 --> 3:19:37.340]  As they were burning Waco down in 93, ramming it with tanks and had troops firing into it on FLIR footage.
[3:19:37.340 --> 3:19:39.340]  They were broadcasting on bull horns.
[3:19:39.340 --> 3:19:40.340]  We're not assaulting.
[3:19:40.340 --> 3:19:41.340]  Come out with your hands up.
[3:19:41.340 --> 3:19:43.340]  When they come out, they shoot them.
[3:19:43.340 --> 3:19:45.340]  As they're firing, we're not assaulting.
[3:19:45.340 --> 3:19:47.340]  This is not an assault.
[3:19:47.340 --> 3:19:49.340]  They're shooting people.
[3:19:49.340 --> 3:19:50.340]  That's the same thing.
[3:19:50.340 --> 3:19:52.340]  We're not making you take the shot.
[3:19:52.340 --> 3:19:53.340]  It's a conspiracy theory.
[3:19:53.340 --> 3:19:54.340]  Nobody's got to take it.
[3:19:54.340 --> 3:19:56.340]  We're not making nurses take it.
[3:19:56.340 --> 3:20:23.340]  And then meanwhile, it's happening.
[3:20:23.340 --> 3:20:26.340]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[3:20:26.340 --> 3:20:28.340]  I'm going to start page to my browser.
[3:20:28.340 --> 3:20:57.340]  Start page dot com and start searching with privacy.
[3:20:58.340 --> 3:21:07.340]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to grounds here
[3:21:07.340 --> 3:21:10.340]  and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[3:21:10.340 --> 3:21:17.340]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[3:21:17.340 --> 3:21:26.340]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[3:21:26.340 --> 3:21:33.340]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[3:21:33.340 --> 3:21:36.340]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[3:21:36.340 --> 3:21:42.340]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[3:21:42.340 --> 3:21:45.340]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[3:21:54.340 --> 3:22:00.340]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[3:22:00.340 --> 3:22:05.340]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.

[3:24:01.340 --> 3:24:16.340]  Now, I know these calls are going to be incredibly important, like that firefighter slash truck driver whose wife's in Virginia told they got to take the shot, but don't tell the public.
[3:24:16.340 --> 3:24:24.340]  See, they want to keep all this secret, just like their secret CDC documents admit it's giving people neurological disorders.
[3:24:24.340 --> 3:24:29.340]  That's mainstream news now, secret government documents. I mean, this is crazy.
[3:24:29.340 --> 3:24:34.340]  I know these calls are going to be important, but I got to move through them quick because I want to get to more people here.
[3:24:34.340 --> 3:24:43.340]  We're going to continue day after day here taking your calls, proving they're doing forced inoculations and that there's a media blackout on it except for a few articles in New York and Boston.
[3:24:43.340 --> 3:24:48.340]  Those are the two, and England's admitting it, France, Greece are admitting it, but not in the U.S.
[3:24:48.340 --> 3:24:54.340]  Because if we could admit they're forcibly inoculating and plan to do it for us, people stand up and say no.
[3:24:54.340 --> 3:24:57.340]  But if they just keep coming to the school going, you got to take it.
[3:24:57.340 --> 3:25:04.340]  People will be isolated individually and can be cornered. This is diabolical. This is how the tyranny works.
[3:25:04.340 --> 3:25:12.340]  But if we wake up, it fails. It is essential to get the word out that the vaccinations are forcible and have begun through color of law and fraud.
[3:25:12.340 --> 3:25:16.340]  We're going to go to Tom in Costa Rica, Joe in Long Island, Michael everybody.
[3:25:16.340 --> 3:25:21.340]  Let's go to Joe in Long Island, wife as a nurse, then to Costa Rica. Joe, you're on the air.
[3:25:21.340 --> 3:25:28.340]  Hey, Alex, how are you doing? I'll get right to the point. My wife is a nurse for 25 years at North Shore, Long Island, Jewish Long Island,
[3:25:28.340 --> 3:25:32.340]  which is a conglomerate that owns all the major hospitals in the area.
[3:25:32.340 --> 3:25:38.340]  And she carpools with her supervisor, and she dropped the bomb on her the other day.
[3:25:38.340 --> 3:25:47.340]  They have to get a mandatory vaccination, and if they refuse, they will have one week paid administrative leave,
[3:25:47.340 --> 3:25:51.340]  and then after that week, you're put on a list.
[3:25:51.340 --> 3:25:58.340]  So basically, they're threatening to make you lose your job, but the intel we've got from 2002 with a smallpox forced to knock,
[3:25:58.340 --> 3:26:03.340]  and this one, if you say, fine, I'm going to court, they back off.
[3:26:03.340 --> 3:26:09.340]  Right. I would ask her over the last few weeks, couple of months, have you heard anything? Have you heard anything?
[3:26:09.340 --> 3:26:12.340]  And then she mentioned it the other day, and I guess it makes perfect sense,
[3:26:12.340 --> 3:26:17.340]  where they're really waiting to last second to spring it on, and they also have a deadline of November 30.
[3:26:17.340 --> 3:26:21.340]  Exactly, exactly. So we can't build up resistance. Sorry, go ahead.
[3:26:21.340 --> 3:26:27.340]  Exactly. Yeah, they have a deadline of November 30, and my wife, she's of the mindset,
[3:26:27.340 --> 3:26:33.340]  and she's finally listening to me, but her mindset is, well, I'm going to wait for the last minute,
[3:26:33.340 --> 3:26:39.340]  and they have these hat, these deluded rebellion things amongst the nurses in the hospital.
[3:26:39.340 --> 3:26:46.340]  Well, we'll sign a, you know, under protest, or I'm like, you have to just not take the shot, you know.
[3:26:46.340 --> 3:26:51.340]  Look, look, any shot they try to make you take guarantees got bad stuff in it.
[3:26:51.340 --> 3:26:55.340]  The adjuvant alone, we've had medical doctor on after medical doctor.
[3:26:55.340 --> 3:27:01.340]  They admit when they gave conservatively half this much adjuvant in the anthrax shots,
[3:27:01.340 --> 3:27:05.340]  the army admits it killed a bunch of the troops and paralyzed a bunch of them.
[3:27:05.340 --> 3:27:11.340]  I mean, there is no, did you hear the caller, the lady yesterday, who's talking about the nurses
[3:27:11.340 --> 3:27:13.340]  who took the shot and their arms are paralyzed?
[3:27:13.340 --> 3:27:20.340]  Yes, I did, and I would show my wife, you know, all the pertinent videos and articles to back everything up,
[3:27:20.340 --> 3:27:23.340]  and it's like she hasn't been listening to me for the last couple of years,
[3:27:23.340 --> 3:27:25.340]  and then all of a sudden the light goes on overhead.
[3:27:25.340 --> 3:27:29.340]  Well, why isn't this on, you know, mainstream news, and, you know, that's how far out of the loop.
[3:27:29.340 --> 3:27:32.340]  Because it's a black op, it's a black op.
[3:27:32.340 --> 3:27:38.340]  This whole thing, folks, I was a normal mainline libertarian talk show host till black helicopters
[3:27:38.340 --> 3:27:42.340]  started attacking cities in Texas and bribing police chiefs,
[3:27:42.340 --> 3:27:46.340]  and then when I spoke out against it, I got attacked in the media,
[3:27:46.340 --> 3:27:51.340]  because there's a giant black ops going on all over the place, all around us.
[3:27:51.340 --> 3:27:56.340]  I don't have all the answers, I'm just telling listeners, we're in a lot of trouble, folks.
[3:27:56.340 --> 3:28:01.340]  Yeah, I'm surprised no one's really called up, you know, because it's been out there for a few weeks now
[3:28:01.340 --> 3:28:06.340]  from the Long Island, you know, this major hospital, you know, because I have a friend of mine.
[3:28:06.340 --> 3:28:11.340]  It's every hospital, look, I've got family and medical care, and they won't go on record,
[3:28:11.340 --> 3:28:13.340]  they're all being told in Austin this.
[3:28:13.340 --> 3:28:16.340]  We're getting calls from Austin, it's totally criminal.
[3:28:16.340 --> 3:28:20.340]  Don't tell anybody, don't stand up for yourself, but we're going to forcibly inject you with a regular flu,
[3:28:20.340 --> 3:28:23.340]  and the new one, and with whatever else we say in the future.
[3:28:23.340 --> 3:28:25.340]  I appreciate your call, great points.
[3:28:25.340 --> 3:28:28.340]  Have your wife on her day off calling to the show.
[3:28:28.340 --> 3:28:35.340]  Let's go to a caller in Costa Rica, Tom, what's your intel?
[3:28:35.340 --> 3:28:39.340]  Hi, Alex, thanks for your broadcast, and educating everyone.
[3:28:39.340 --> 3:28:45.340]  My daughter is a nurse in San Fernando Valley West Hills Hospital, run by HCA Corporation out of Texas,
[3:28:45.340 --> 3:28:50.340]  one of the larger hospital operators last Thursday.
[3:28:50.340 --> 3:28:56.340]  The nurse came in with the regular flu shot, they were provided with a paper to fill out,
[3:28:56.340 --> 3:29:00.340]  one side to consent to and receive the shot, the other was to sign refusal,
[3:29:00.340 --> 3:29:03.340]  and at the bottom it said by October 1st.
[3:29:03.340 --> 3:29:07.340]  Well, see, that's what the news is reporting, is that they're allowed to refuse,
[3:29:07.340 --> 3:29:11.340]  but then we keep getting intel that they're being told they'll be fired.
[3:29:11.340 --> 3:29:13.340]  Well, they are, and this was as you-
[3:29:13.340 --> 3:29:17.340]  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, they told her she'd be fired, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[3:29:17.340 --> 3:29:19.340]  Oh, yeah, and if you-
[3:29:19.340 --> 3:29:22.340]  Wait, I'm going to shut up, you tell me what she said then, I misunderstood.
[3:29:22.340 --> 3:29:28.340]  I was hoping that they would- I sent your guys, I documented this and sent the letter that she gave me.
[3:29:28.340 --> 3:29:31.340]  I've educated my children for 15 years about this stuff.
[3:29:31.340 --> 3:29:34.340]  When did you send it and to what email?
[3:29:34.340 --> 3:29:38.340]  I sent it to Showtips at Impalores last Friday.
[3:29:38.340 --> 3:29:40.340]  Can you send it again right now?
[3:29:40.340 --> 3:29:42.340]  I will.
[3:29:42.340 --> 3:29:44.340]  Hold on, hold on, I want to talk to you during the break.
[3:29:44.340 --> 3:29:47.340]  Stay there, we'll be right back, we're going to give you an email.
[3:29:47.340 --> 3:29:49.340]  We're on the march.
[3:29:49.340 --> 3:29:51.340]  The Empire's on the run.
[3:29:51.340 --> 3:29:54.340]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:29:54.340 --> 3:29:58.340]  Hello, friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[3:29:58.340 --> 3:30:00.340]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[3:30:00.340 --> 3:30:04.340]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor,
[3:30:04.340 --> 3:30:09.340]  they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[3:30:09.340 --> 3:30:12.340]  Many of these chemicals are directly related to water.
[3:30:12.340 --> 3:30:17.340]  Reproductive, immune and developmental system diseases.
[3:30:17.340 --> 3:30:19.340]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[3:30:19.340 --> 3:30:25.340]  The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[3:30:25.340 --> 3:30:30.340]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere
[3:30:30.340 --> 3:30:36.340]  and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[3:30:36.340 --> 3:30:38.340]  That's right, clean water.

[3:31:04.340 --> 3:31:09.340]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[3:31:09.340 --> 3:31:17.340]  Shocking, declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[3:31:17.340 --> 3:31:25.340]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[3:31:25.340 --> 3:31:32.340]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[3:31:32.340 --> 3:31:37.340]  secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[3:31:37.340 --> 3:31:41.340]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[3:31:41.340 --> 3:31:43.340]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[3:31:43.340 --> 3:31:48.340]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[3:32:01.340 --> 3:32:06.340]  Food security from E-FoodsDirect, the most valuable protection your family can have.
[3:32:06.340 --> 3:32:12.340]  It's a scary world we live in, schools closed, businesses shut down, and reports of death all from the swine flu.
[3:32:12.340 --> 3:32:15.340]  We've had more bank failures this year than the previous 10 years combined.
[3:32:15.340 --> 3:32:23.340]  And money will soon be more valuable as toilet paper due to the nation's $12 trillion debt, which is why gold is now over $1,000 an ounce.
[3:32:23.340 --> 3:32:27.340]  According to the Atlanta Fed chief, unemployment is actually 16%.

[3:33:26.340 --> 3:33:29.340]  We're doing the best we can. The crew is working their butts off.
[3:33:29.340 --> 3:33:35.340]  I need Paul Watson and Steve Watson and Kurt Nemo to do separate stories.
[3:33:35.340 --> 3:33:39.340]  The big news is this is all hidden in plain view.
[3:33:39.340 --> 3:33:45.340]  They are ordering medical workers, people that carry out the trash at these facilities.
[3:33:45.340 --> 3:33:48.340]  I've confirmed in Austin as well at hospitals.
[3:33:48.340 --> 3:33:54.340]  Anybody that works at a hospital to take the regular flu shot and the H1N1 and maybe more, they're telling them.
[3:33:54.340 --> 3:34:01.340]  We're setting a whole precedent under Level 6 World Health Organization rules with the UN.
[3:34:01.340 --> 3:34:07.340]  They say they can have checkpoints, lockdowns. They've got a microchip they want to implant.
[3:34:07.340 --> 3:34:11.340]  It says for the flu pandemic to prove you've had it.
[3:34:11.340 --> 3:34:16.340]  We've aired a Army officer last week who's training with the chips in California.
[3:34:16.340 --> 3:34:19.340]  We confirmed the Army's secretly training and checkpoints.
[3:34:19.340 --> 3:34:22.340]  So was the Marine Corps months ago. We didn't know exactly why.
[3:34:22.340 --> 3:34:25.340]  We've confirmed that to lockdown cities and forced inoculations.
[3:34:25.340 --> 3:34:27.340]  Let me make it very clear to everybody.
[3:34:27.340 --> 3:34:34.340]  If we don't expose the danger of the vaccine, the illegalness of it, how it's a scam, and how they're lying about launching it,
[3:34:34.340 --> 3:34:38.340]  they're going to get away with launching this program against us.
[3:34:38.340 --> 3:34:49.340]  So a multi-prong attack, getting Horowitz's letter out is important, paramount, but also paramount peak importance,
[3:34:49.340 --> 3:34:53.340]  is exposing with the video clip of Obama.
[3:34:53.340 --> 3:34:54.340]  You can just YouTube it.
[3:34:54.340 --> 3:34:56.340]  Obama says you won't have to take vaccine.
[3:34:56.340 --> 3:34:57.340]  In fact, we ought to pull that up later.
[3:34:57.340 --> 3:35:03.340]  I may even go into overdrive, but I got so much to do today.
[3:35:03.340 --> 3:35:06.340]  Finishing up with Tom, and I'm going to try to run to all these other callers.
[3:35:06.340 --> 3:35:09.340]  Tom, you've sent us the letter from your daughter in her hospital.
[3:35:09.340 --> 3:35:15.340]  I guess you want us to black her name out, obviously, because how dare her not want to take the shot.
[3:35:15.340 --> 3:35:23.340]  So specifically, they told her they were giving them to everybody else on the staff.
[3:35:23.340 --> 3:35:27.340]  Those people weren't even asking whether it was H1N1 or the regular flu shot.
[3:35:27.340 --> 3:35:28.340]  They asked no questions.
[3:35:28.340 --> 3:35:31.340]  They just didn't want to lose their job by October 1st.
[3:35:31.340 --> 3:35:35.340]  And she was exposed two months ago that the hospital told her.
[3:35:35.340 --> 3:35:37.340]  They told her she would be tested checked.
[3:35:37.340 --> 3:35:43.340]  Nothing has occurred since then, and she told them that at this inoculation on Thursday,
[3:35:43.340 --> 3:35:45.340]  and said, what about your testing?
[3:35:45.340 --> 3:35:47.340]  I may already have it.
[3:35:47.340 --> 3:35:48.340]  What is going on?
[3:35:48.340 --> 3:35:49.340]  What are you doing?
[3:35:49.340 --> 3:35:51.340]  Well, you'll have to talk to human resources.
[3:35:51.340 --> 3:35:59.340]  And we don't have all the information yet, but by October 1st, you take this or you must wear a mask.
[3:35:59.340 --> 3:36:04.340]  And if you don't wear the mask, she asks questions like, well, what are the parameters for wearing the mask?
[3:36:04.340 --> 3:36:08.340]  After wear it when I go to the bathroom, are the doctors going to be required to take shots?
[3:36:08.340 --> 3:36:10.340]  Are visitors going to be required to take shots?
[3:36:10.340 --> 3:36:11.340]  We don't know.
[3:36:11.340 --> 3:36:14.340]  We have to ask human resources later.
[3:36:14.340 --> 3:36:15.340]  We don't have the policy for that.
[3:36:15.340 --> 3:36:20.340]  And yet they're giving shots last Thursday to everybody on their staff in West Hills, California.
[3:36:20.340 --> 3:36:23.340]  Well, they're telling other people they're going to be fired if they don't take it.
[3:36:23.340 --> 3:36:24.340]  You just heard them.
[3:36:24.340 --> 3:36:25.340]  Well, she was threatened.
[3:36:25.340 --> 3:36:35.340]  She, on the back of that document that I told you they presented to her, it said, if you don't comply, you will voluntarily be terminated.
[3:36:35.340 --> 3:36:37.340]  You will voluntarily resign.
[3:36:37.340 --> 3:36:40.340]  It's in the letter that I sent you.
[3:36:40.340 --> 3:36:43.340]  Now, Tom, we've got the email from you.
[3:36:43.340 --> 3:36:45.340]  We don't have the letter.
[3:36:45.340 --> 3:36:47.340]  We don't have the hospital letter.
[3:36:47.340 --> 3:36:53.340]  It was her letter to me explaining what she went through on Thursday.
[3:36:53.340 --> 3:37:00.340]  But can you get us a copy of the original letter?
[3:37:00.340 --> 3:37:02.340]  Oh, of the document.
[3:37:02.340 --> 3:37:04.340]  I'll have to get that from her.
[3:37:04.340 --> 3:37:05.340]  She's at work today.
[3:37:05.340 --> 3:37:13.340]  Okay, sir, we're having call after call about this in the news admitted a month ago in New York.
[3:37:13.340 --> 3:37:14.340]  They were ordering the same thing.
[3:37:14.340 --> 3:37:16.340]  So we know this is going on.
[3:37:16.340 --> 3:37:18.340]  We just need the proof.
[3:37:18.340 --> 3:37:19.340]  So everybody send it.
[3:37:19.340 --> 3:37:25.340]  If whoever's got it, send it to show tips and info wars.com and Aaron info wars.com.
[3:37:25.340 --> 3:37:26.340]  Thank you so much, sir.
[3:37:26.340 --> 3:37:27.340]  Michael in Chicago.
[3:37:27.340 --> 3:37:32.340]  Well, before I go to Michael in Chicago, here is the hotline number specifically.
[3:37:32.340 --> 3:37:37.340]  If you were told you'd be fired if you didn't take the shot and specifically on top of it.
[3:37:37.340 --> 3:37:43.340]  If you have a letter, you can send us 888-201-2244-888-201-2244.
[3:37:43.340 --> 3:37:46.340]  Here it is 888-201-2244.
[3:37:46.340 --> 3:37:54.340]  Because if we can prove this is going on, which we know it is everybody's calling in with it happen to their wives and husbands and other people.
[3:37:54.340 --> 3:37:59.340]  Then we can have a united front by admitting this is going on.
[3:37:59.340 --> 3:38:01.340]  Let's talk to Michael in Chicago.
[3:38:01.340 --> 3:38:03.340]  Michael, you're on the air.
[3:38:03.340 --> 3:38:04.340]  Thanks, Alex.
[3:38:04.340 --> 3:38:06.340]  A couple of quick items.
[3:38:06.340 --> 3:38:18.340]  My sister-in-law is a nurse in Northern California and they've consistently tried to have her take the normal flu shots and she's consistently refused.
[3:38:18.340 --> 3:38:30.340]  So I'll be in touch with her shortly because we were trying to work on a strategy because we knew that they'd be pushing really hard if not mandatory for her to get the H1N1 shot.
[3:38:30.340 --> 3:38:32.340]  So I'll get that information from her.
[3:38:32.340 --> 3:38:35.340]  Second item and I'm former military.
[3:38:35.340 --> 3:38:38.340]  This is in the Chicago breaking news deal.
[3:38:38.340 --> 3:38:40.340]  So something weird is going on here.
[3:38:40.340 --> 3:38:46.340]  Down here at University of Chicago and I'm in the area and affiliated with a lot of the medical folks down there.
[3:38:46.340 --> 3:38:53.340]  Professor just died due to a plague, some sort of plague deal that he was working on.
[3:38:53.340 --> 3:38:56.340]  Very suspicious story here.
[3:38:56.340 --> 3:39:10.340]  It indicates that he was a geneticist and that this exposure, this weakened strain of Yersinia testis somehow became dangerous and that it somehow targeted his genetic.
[3:39:10.340 --> 3:39:12.340]  Yeah, let me tell you what's going on with that.
[3:39:12.340 --> 3:39:16.340]  They've built 36 level four bio weapons labs in level two.
[3:39:16.340 --> 3:39:25.340]  No big deal containment at major universities across the country from UT at Austin to the University of Chicago.
[3:39:25.340 --> 3:39:29.340]  All over the country and that's what's going on here.
[3:39:29.340 --> 3:39:31.340]  I didn't see the particular article though.
[3:39:31.340 --> 3:39:33.340]  What's the headline?
[3:39:33.340 --> 3:39:37.340]  Chicago Department of Public Health, plague, death, not a threat to public health.
[3:39:37.340 --> 3:39:42.340]  So now they're giving antibiotics to family, friends and coworkers of this guy.
[3:39:42.340 --> 3:39:46.340]  And they don't know what the, you know, they're downplaying it.
[3:39:46.340 --> 3:39:51.340]  But if you read the article, there's a lot of unanswered questions here.
[3:39:51.340 --> 3:39:56.340]  If I could jump just the other day, we were at our daycare.
[3:39:56.340 --> 3:40:00.340]  And again, I'm in the University of Chicago for everyone's medical, whatever.
[3:40:00.340 --> 3:40:06.340]  One of the doctors hopped up, her child is in the class with us and she gave this huge pitch.
[3:40:06.340 --> 3:40:10.340]  You know, she's been in touch with the Department of Public Health, you name it.
[3:40:10.340 --> 3:40:14.340]  And it is imperative that, you know, get the kids vaccinated.
[3:40:14.340 --> 3:40:16.340]  You get vaccinated when, you know, when the vaccine.
[3:40:16.340 --> 3:40:21.340]  Yeah, they're brainwashing. Walgreens give mothers stickers in Austin that say,
[3:40:21.340 --> 3:40:23.340]  I vaccinated my child. I care.
[3:40:23.340 --> 3:40:27.340]  So it's like a cult of pro vaccine people marching around,
[3:40:27.340 --> 3:40:30.340]  arrogantly writing editorials in everybody's face.
[3:40:30.340 --> 3:40:36.340]  Yeah, they're absolutely nuts with it down here, including the woman who told us
[3:40:36.340 --> 3:40:41.340]  that we want to give vitamins to our daughter, which turned out to be fluoride for teeth.
[3:40:41.340 --> 3:40:43.340]  Amazing. God bless you, sir.
[3:40:43.340 --> 3:40:47.340]  I want to bring Paul Watson up briefly. And then specifically, guys,
[3:40:47.340 --> 3:40:49.340]  I'm having trouble with my call list computer in here.
[3:40:49.340 --> 3:40:55.340]  If you'll hand write me Bob, the any key whistleblower calls on our hotline.
[3:40:55.340 --> 3:41:02.340]  I'll be able to get it up. We're going to go to Steve, Ron, Alan, Jonathan here in just a moment with key info.
[3:41:02.340 --> 3:41:04.340]  But I wanted to bring Watson up Watson.
[3:41:04.340 --> 3:41:07.340]  What's the best email for people to get into?
[3:41:07.340 --> 3:41:12.340]  I know you have several for you to scan for letters that nurses and doctors are being given,
[3:41:12.340 --> 3:41:16.340]  ordering them to take the shot of their fired because we can break the hoax
[3:41:16.340 --> 3:41:19.340]  that Obama's put out saying nobody's got to take it.
[3:41:19.340 --> 3:41:25.340]  We've confirmed they're doing this, but we need the letters, not just people calling in with it.
[3:41:25.340 --> 3:41:28.340]  We have some New York articles where they are saying they want to make people take it,
[3:41:28.340 --> 3:41:30.340]  but then they backed off somewhat.
[3:41:30.340 --> 3:41:35.340]  So they're testing the water that I want to put you on this to with the birds I have you to watch for the emails
[3:41:35.340 --> 3:41:39.340]  because people keep calling saying they've sent them, but we've missed them in the thousands of emails.
[3:41:39.340 --> 3:41:42.340]  What's the best email for you, Watson?
[3:41:42.340 --> 3:41:50.340]  The best email and if you send it to this one, both myself and Kurt will get it at the same time
[3:41:50.340 --> 3:41:56.340]  because we've both got access is writers at infowars.com.
[3:41:56.340 --> 3:42:00.340]  Okay, and that doesn't go into a general mailbox. You have a certain box for that?
[3:42:00.340 --> 3:42:04.340]  That goes direct to me in my personal email as well.
[3:42:04.340 --> 3:42:08.340]  What do you think about all this craziness going on?
[3:42:08.340 --> 3:42:13.340]  I think that they're definitely preparing for a mass vaccination campaign.
[3:42:13.340 --> 3:42:18.340]  I don't think it's going to be enforced at gunpoint, but as we've discussed before,
[3:42:18.340 --> 3:42:23.340]  it's going to be about threatening people's jobs and taking people's rights away if they don't take it.
[3:42:23.340 --> 3:42:28.340]  So if you live in a cave, you know, up in the mountains or something,
[3:42:28.340 --> 3:42:32.340]  then yeah, you don't have to take it without your life being affected.
[3:42:32.340 --> 3:42:38.340]  For any of us who travel or any of us who have jobs or use any services connected to the state,
[3:42:38.340 --> 3:42:44.340]  then they're going to make you have it and they're going to force people to take it by taking it right away.
[3:42:44.340 --> 3:42:50.340]  Exactly. Have you seen Verichip for a triage system?
[3:42:50.340 --> 3:42:55.340]  Do you take an implantable chip to prove you've had the shot?
[3:42:55.340 --> 3:43:02.340]  Yeah, their stock's gone up 200% on a day when, you know, stock markets flat, so that's the story up there.
[3:43:02.340 --> 3:43:08.340]  The story I put out a couple of hours ago is somebody who's a CEO
[3:43:08.340 --> 3:43:15.340]  and they got sent a survey by the University of Virginia Health Department
[3:43:15.340 --> 3:43:20.340]  and in that survey there's 81 questions, some of which are about
[3:43:20.340 --> 3:43:26.340]  if there's a swine flu outbreak, you know, if it returns deadlier than ever, as we've been promised,
[3:43:26.340 --> 3:43:30.340]  will they follow the government's orders, will they obey the authorities,
[3:43:30.340 --> 3:43:35.340]  and will they take the vaccine if it's, quote, delivered to them by the authorities?
[3:43:35.340 --> 3:43:39.340]  So they're testing for martial law through the infregard to see if they'll follow orders.
[3:43:39.340 --> 3:43:42.340]  What is the name of this incredible article?
[3:43:42.340 --> 3:43:47.340]  It's, Will Americans Abay Government Orders During a Swine Flu Pandemic?
[3:43:47.340 --> 3:43:55.340]  This survey sponsored by a group that's specifically looking at what happens when people stop trusting authorities
[3:43:55.340 --> 3:44:00.340]  and it's clear that they're gauging the response that Americans will have to
[3:44:00.340 --> 3:44:06.340]  the authorities going out and trying to inoculate people and generally, you know, imposing quarantines
[3:44:06.340 --> 3:44:08.340]  or telling them to stay in their own house.
[3:44:08.340 --> 3:44:12.340]  Clearly, Paul, they're using this as a cover for martial law, whether it's a deadly flu or not.
[3:44:12.340 --> 3:44:14.340]  We are in deep crap. Thank you so much.
[3:44:14.340 --> 3:44:15.340]  Thanks, Alex.
[3:44:15.340 --> 3:44:19.340]  My head is just spinning at this point.
[3:44:19.340 --> 3:44:23.340]  Let's go to Dan in Illinois. Dan, you're on the air.
[3:44:23.340 --> 3:44:25.340]  Hi, Alex. How you doing?
[3:44:25.340 --> 3:44:34.340]  Yeah, actually, I work for a hospital in Illinois and actually they're forcing us to take the regular flu shot
[3:44:34.340 --> 3:44:41.340]  and then they're saying that we could possibly be forced into the swine flu shot
[3:44:41.340 --> 3:44:44.340]  depending on how many vaccinations are available.
[3:44:44.340 --> 3:44:48.340]  Sure. So we know they're getting you ready with the regular flu next week with the official H1N1.
[3:44:48.340 --> 3:44:55.340]  This is confirmed. Everybody's calling in nurses, husbands of nurses, wives of nurses, doctors,
[3:44:55.340 --> 3:44:58.340]  and then Obama's on TV saying you don't have to take it.
[3:44:58.340 --> 3:45:05.340]  What authority did they cite to make you take a deadly medical procedure to keep your job?
[3:45:05.340 --> 3:45:16.340]  Really, I have no idea. That's just what they're telling us right now. We actually can be terminated if we don't take the regular flu shot.
[3:45:16.340 --> 3:45:18.340]  Did they give you a letter?
[3:45:18.340 --> 3:45:24.340]  Yeah, actually, I got it pulled up now. I'm trying to send it to my other email address, so I don't send it from the actual hospital.
[3:45:24.340 --> 3:45:30.340]  We'll block it out. Yeah, no, I understand. Don't send it from the hospital because they'll be able to.
[3:45:30.340 --> 3:45:36.340]  Okay, will you please? I'm going to put you on hold. I'm going to give you a secret email so we get this.
[3:45:36.340 --> 3:45:41.340]  Will you please, please get that to me immediately?
[3:45:41.340 --> 3:45:47.340]  Because when we can show there's a giant secret operation going on, this is going to be so important to defeating this.
[3:45:47.340 --> 3:45:49.340]  How soon can you get us that email?
[3:45:49.340 --> 3:45:53.340]  I'm working on it right now. I just need the email address.
[3:45:53.340 --> 3:46:02.340]  We'll put him on hold, ladies and gentlemen, get Dan in Illinois info and get this sent to the secret email right now.
[3:46:02.340 --> 3:46:06.340]  Oh, man. Oh, my God.
[3:46:06.340 --> 3:46:15.340]  Because even if you're for the flu shot, they're lying on TV saying nobody has to take it, and I'm taking call after call from nurses and medical workers.
[3:46:15.340 --> 3:46:18.340]  They got to take it.
[3:46:18.340 --> 3:46:23.340]  Steve in Washington, you're on the air. Steve, go ahead.
[3:46:23.340 --> 3:46:34.340]  Hello, Alex. I'm just calling. Right now I'm in the military, and we just got an email about a week ago telling us to get ready to take the regular seasonal flu shot upcoming here in a couple of weeks,
[3:46:34.340 --> 3:46:38.340]  and then to be prepared next month to take the one for the H1N1.
[3:46:38.340 --> 3:46:45.340]  But listening to your program over the past few months, you've been talking about all the negative effects it's been having when they were going through the trials.
[3:46:45.340 --> 3:46:54.340]  You know, from my point of view, I think I'm better off just taking my chances, getting the swine flu, considering how it really hasn't had much of an effect on the people who've been having it.
[3:46:54.340 --> 3:46:57.340]  You know, there hasn't been any deaths caused by it.
[3:46:57.340 --> 3:47:06.340]  Well, I've got Reuters saying flu experts gear up for pandemic vaccine worry, admitting it's going to hurt all these people, but saying, if you get hurt, we're not even going to look at it being the vaccine.
[3:47:06.340 --> 3:47:13.340]  And then another Reuters saying swine flu death rates similar to seasonal flu, experts says no big deal.
[3:47:13.340 --> 3:47:24.340]  Yeah, but you know, the presence that they're using from this is really, in my opinion, completely inaccurate based on the fact that there's been such a little effect that it's been having on people.
[3:47:24.340 --> 3:47:32.340]  Well, Steve, never forget that the White House science are said they want to put sterilence in vaccines and your water to sterilize you.
[3:47:32.340 --> 3:47:33.340]  God bless you.
[3:47:33.340 --> 3:47:36.340]  The books, Eco Science, John P. Holdren.
[3:47:36.340 --> 3:47:38.340]  All right, we've got Ron in New York.
[3:47:38.340 --> 3:47:39.340]  Wife is being forced to take vaccine.
[3:47:39.340 --> 3:47:41.340]  Ron, you're on the air.
[3:47:41.340 --> 3:47:43.340]  It's a pleasure.
[3:47:43.340 --> 3:47:48.340]  Yeah, my wife actually was terminated because she refused it.
[3:47:48.340 --> 3:47:49.340]  Oh, I've got to have her on.
[3:47:49.340 --> 3:47:51.340]  I've got to have her on, sir.
[3:47:51.340 --> 3:47:54.340]  You've got such a lawsuit.
[3:47:54.340 --> 3:47:56.340]  I'm working away from my house right now, so.
[3:47:56.340 --> 3:47:58.340]  No, no, I'm saying maybe we should get your number.
[3:47:58.340 --> 3:48:01.340]  Would your wife come on?
[3:48:01.340 --> 3:48:02.340]  Not sure.
[3:48:02.340 --> 3:48:03.340]  I'd have to talk to her.
[3:48:03.340 --> 3:48:04.340]  So they fired her.
[3:48:04.340 --> 3:48:05.340]  Tell us what happened.
[3:48:05.340 --> 3:48:12.340]  Well, basically, they started with a memo saying that there may be a mandatory vaccination.
[3:48:12.340 --> 3:48:27.340]  Then about two weeks later, the nurse left to go get the bunch of antibiotics, whatever, the group, until they're straight out that either you take the shot or you don't have a job.
[3:48:27.340 --> 3:48:32.340]  And then her and five of her coworkers stood up and said, refuse a shot and all six of them lost their jobs.
[3:48:32.340 --> 3:48:34.340]  That's Nazi Germany.
[3:48:34.340 --> 3:48:38.340]  But meanwhile, Obama's on TV saying it's a conspiracy theory.
[3:48:38.340 --> 3:48:41.340]  Nobody's got to take the shot.
[3:48:41.340 --> 3:48:44.340]  I've come to last year that I've been enlightened by you.
[3:48:44.340 --> 3:48:47.340]  I've come to not believe much that comes out of anybody's mouth.
[3:48:47.340 --> 3:48:48.340]  Well, more than that.
[3:48:48.340 --> 3:48:53.340]  Normally, if they say something, it's 180 degrees different.
[3:48:53.340 --> 3:49:02.340]  So, but yeah, like I said, she actually, and then they told her, well, you're the remainder of your career in the medical field will be a jeopardy if you don't take these shots.
[3:49:02.340 --> 3:49:05.340]  My God, she's got, and they, and they terminated her for what?
[3:49:05.340 --> 3:49:07.340]  Because she refused.
[3:49:07.340 --> 3:49:09.340]  And there's no way to get your wife on.
[3:49:09.340 --> 3:49:10.340]  She doesn't want to talk.
[3:49:10.340 --> 3:49:16.340]  Well, I, I have, I just heard you talking about today wanting to make the call and I haven't even talked to her.
[3:49:16.340 --> 3:49:25.340]  She, you know, we won't, we won't pressure you, but can I put you on hold and get your name and number or can we give you our number, the producer's number so you can call us.
[3:49:25.340 --> 3:49:28.340]  I'll give her a call and talk to her and see if I can get her to call.
[3:49:28.340 --> 3:49:35.340]  Okay, John Harmon, please give him our producer number here and Ron call us.
[3:49:35.340 --> 3:49:37.340]  It's important your wife come on and fight this.
[3:49:37.340 --> 3:49:40.340]  She has nothing else to lose, but good job saying no.
[3:49:40.340 --> 3:49:41.340]  Thank you.
[3:49:41.340 --> 3:49:42.340]  God bless you, sir.
[3:49:42.340 --> 3:49:43.340]  Oh, man.
[3:49:43.340 --> 3:49:47.340]  And then these bastards on TV say none of this is happening.
[3:49:47.340 --> 3:49:51.340]  Call her after, call her after, call her after, call her and I could take hundreds.
[3:49:51.340 --> 3:49:52.340]  We'll do it tomorrow.
[3:49:52.340 --> 3:49:55.340]  Let's talk to Alan in Kansas.
[3:49:55.340 --> 3:49:58.340]  Mom works for health department.
[3:49:58.340 --> 3:49:59.340]  Go ahead, Alan.
[3:49:59.340 --> 3:50:00.340]  Hey, Alex.
[3:50:00.340 --> 3:50:13.340]  Yeah, my mom was saying that the swarming flu vaccines are on their way and that they don't want to take it mandatory, but it's kind of like, if you don't take it, you really can't work here because you're around a bunch of people.
[3:50:13.340 --> 3:50:16.340]  So it's mainly fear to take it.
[3:50:16.340 --> 3:50:25.340]  And that all I really got from her right after for a letter, but she hasn't got anything like that.
[3:50:25.340 --> 3:50:26.340]  Okay, I got to stop you.
[3:50:26.340 --> 3:50:30.340]  This is off the charts with Paul Hartman just gave me off the charts.
[3:50:30.340 --> 3:50:33.340]  Ladies and gentlemen, we'll finish your point.
[3:50:33.340 --> 3:50:34.340]  I'll cover when we come back.
[3:50:34.340 --> 3:50:35.340]  I can't believe what I was just given.
[3:50:35.340 --> 3:50:38.340]  Go ahead.
[3:50:38.340 --> 3:50:39.340]  Oh, yeah.
[3:50:39.340 --> 3:50:42.340]  Anything else, sir?
[3:50:42.340 --> 3:50:47.340]  Yeah, actually, some kind of for everybody to look at your hand.
[3:50:47.340 --> 3:50:48.340]  You know what?
[3:50:48.340 --> 3:50:49.340]  This is too big.
[3:50:49.340 --> 3:50:50.340]  I'm skipping the break.
[3:50:50.340 --> 3:50:51.340]  I'm skipping the break.
[3:50:51.340 --> 3:50:52.340]  Finish your point, sir.
[3:50:52.340 --> 3:50:53.340]  And then I've got it.
[3:50:53.340 --> 3:50:54.340]  I've got it.
[3:50:54.340 --> 3:50:57.340]  The Navy admits they're preparing for martial law for forced inoculation.
[3:50:57.340 --> 3:51:00.340]  This is Navy dot mail off the charts mega huge.
[3:51:00.340 --> 3:51:02.340]  These bastards, we've got to say no to this.
[3:51:02.340 --> 3:51:03.340]  I'm sorry.
[3:51:03.340 --> 3:51:05.340]  It's all coming in fast now.
[3:51:05.340 --> 3:51:09.340]  Man, I tell you what, nobody's given me or my wife or my kids any damn shots.
[3:51:09.340 --> 3:51:12.340]  I've had enough of you, eugenics, scum, you murdering bastards.
[3:51:12.340 --> 3:51:14.340]  You hit Larry in pieces of trash.
[3:51:14.340 --> 3:51:15.340]  We're on to you.
[3:51:15.340 --> 3:51:17.340]  And I want them brought to justice.
[3:51:17.340 --> 3:51:21.340]  They're trying to break our back and train us to take whatever poison they put in us.
[3:51:21.340 --> 3:51:23.340]  Go ahead and finish your point, sir.
[3:51:23.340 --> 3:51:25.340]  Yes, everybody to look at your hands.
[3:51:25.340 --> 3:51:32.340]  If you have an X in the center or directly above it, it means that your genes have been
[3:51:32.340 --> 3:51:40.340]  mutated by vaccine and now do you get X?
[3:51:40.340 --> 3:51:41.340]  I appreciate your call.
[3:51:41.340 --> 3:51:44.340]  So we're talking about serious issues here.
[3:51:44.340 --> 3:51:52.340]  It is true that mercury and vaccines can mutate the DNA and mutate babies in the womb and genetically from the Zygote level.
[3:51:52.340 --> 3:51:54.340]  All right, let's get serious here.
[3:51:54.340 --> 3:51:58.340]  This is from Navy dot mill official website of the United States Navy.
[3:51:58.340 --> 3:52:01.340]  You see that official website of the United States Navy.
[3:52:01.340 --> 3:52:06.340]  When I broke the Mayak and DHS reports, people didn't believe me and said they were a hoax.
[3:52:06.340 --> 3:52:08.340]  None of this is a hoax.
[3:52:08.340 --> 3:52:10.340]  This is a Navy dot mill.
[3:52:10.340 --> 3:52:11.340]  Red alert.
[3:52:11.340 --> 3:52:12.340]  Red alert.
[3:52:12.340 --> 3:52:16.340]  It's up on info wars dot com saved in case they keep take it down.
[3:52:16.340 --> 3:52:17.340]  Red alert.
[3:52:17.340 --> 3:52:19.340]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[3:52:19.340 --> 3:52:27.340]  Panamax 2009 US military exercise to train soldiers to impose pandemic martial law.
[3:52:27.340 --> 3:52:34.340]  Editors know military exercise to sign a train soldiers to stop people from going to work and school according to US Navy.
[3:52:34.340 --> 3:52:42.340]  And the US Navy announces in the article that that is the case confirming what the army soldiers said in the YouTube video last week.
[3:52:42.340 --> 3:52:44.340]  Working with the chip.
[3:52:44.340 --> 3:52:48.340]  California Highway Patrol in California.
[3:52:48.340 --> 3:52:55.340]  Confirming everything we saw start in January when I told you I believe they were going to launch pandemic flu or at least the fear of the flu.
[3:52:55.340 --> 3:52:58.340]  For martial law in the fall to pass the government health care.
[3:52:58.340 --> 3:53:01.340]  The banking takeover by offshore banks.
[3:53:01.340 --> 3:53:15.340]  The hate crime hate speech laws their whole agenda this fall this winter this is it ladies and gentlemen this is the absolute final piece of the puzzle red level.
[3:53:15.340 --> 3:53:23.340]  Now I've got to go in and finish fall the Republic and I've got to go in and work on this all day or I'd go into overdrive but we will be live 11am tomorrow.
[3:53:23.340 --> 3:53:33.340]  To cover this in detail until everybody you know to tune in tomorrow 11am because there will be a detailed report on the full spectrum of what we're dealing with here.
[3:53:33.340 --> 3:53:47.340]  Representatives of 10 US government agencies are holding a two day tabletop exercise of cooperation with the government of Panama to assist and respond to any future influenza pandemic September 16th the agency representatives are in Panama and conjunction this already happened.
[3:53:47.340 --> 3:53:57.340]  And it goes on representative discuss how the United States and Panamanian government can manage an influenza outbreak by utilizing their agencies to assist in combat and pandemic to combat a pandemic.
[3:53:57.340 --> 3:54:05.340]  Our goals to work it close as possible with Panamanians in case there's a real threat such as a pandemic influenza said US Navy Captain Miguel.
[3:54:05.340 --> 3:54:18.340]  Cubio a medical doctor and command surgeon to the US Southern command we want to help them get set a plan for outbreak that does not have a great impact on our economy stop people from going to work in school and stop the operations.
[3:54:18.340 --> 3:54:30.340]  The agencies present included the Department of State Department of Homeland Security Department of Agriculture Department of Commerce Federal Aviation Administration US Agency for International Development Department of Health Human Services US Army US Coast Guard Navy.
[3:54:30.340 --> 3:54:38.340]  Since the severity of the flu outbreaks is difficult to predict the US agencies are sharing tools and information to help Panama combat any level of influenza outbreak.
[3:54:38.340 --> 3:54:47.340]  Influenza usually starts suddenly and symptoms including goes on US Navy is working with Panamanian government and other agencies to build a preventative plan to fight against disease not just the flu send things going on here in the US.
[3:54:47.340 --> 3:54:57.340]  According to US Coast Guard head of the Coast Guard's Environment Division plan Navy Coast Guard vessels to play an important role Coast Guard to work diligently provide maritime support and role help people in Panama.
[3:54:57.340 --> 3:55:06.340]  And it goes on to talk about largest multinational training exercise in the world they did this earlier two months ago landing in Florida for practice takeover the US.
[3:55:06.340 --> 3:55:12.340]  They had FEMA NLE09 with 14 nations domestically for a takeover the US I forgot about that.
[3:55:12.340 --> 3:55:16.340]  The 2009 is the largest multinational training exercise.
[3:55:16.340 --> 3:55:27.340]  More than 20 vessels and a dozen aircraft are involved in the exercise participants are focusing on a variety of response to any request from the government to protect and guarantee safe passage through traffic.
[3:55:27.340 --> 3:55:35.340]  Ensure its neutrality and respect national sovereignty and it goes on so US forces run a Fort Sam San Antonio Texas to practice taking over Panama for that.
[3:55:35.340 --> 3:55:50.340]  But that's confirmed going on in the United States as well under level six they said they may have quarantines and lockdowns that's been done in the dark winter drills looking at smallpox anthrax and an avian or other type super flu scenario.
[3:55:50.340 --> 3:55:59.340]  We got a bunch of callers calling in here.
[3:55:59.340 --> 3:56:04.340]  Reps came to his school about the flu shot Jonathan Arkansas tell us quickly.
[3:56:04.340 --> 3:56:06.340]  Hey Alex how you doing.
[3:56:06.340 --> 3:56:07.340]  Good.
[3:56:07.340 --> 3:56:09.340]  Oh yeah sure.
[3:56:09.340 --> 3:56:11.340]  Yeah I'm not doing too good and I'm sorry.
[3:56:11.340 --> 3:56:31.340]  I'm ITT Tech and like two days like last week last week our state representative comes to our school and starts talking about the flu shots and how important it is for us to get them and then he goes into this long speech about our amendment rights and how we can tear down the government that's not for us and everything.
[3:56:31.340 --> 3:56:37.340]  So after his little speech I come to him I say why is our government trying to disarm us.
[3:56:37.340 --> 3:56:42.340]  And he's like what do you mean I said there's a shortage of ammunition for us to protect ourselves and everything like that.
[3:56:42.340 --> 3:56:49.340]  And he says I have no idea what you're talking about because right when I said that his eyes went big and he was like almost ready to get out of it.
[3:56:49.340 --> 3:57:01.340]  You know what I mean because he has a run he has run into any kind of students or whatever like that that haven't spoken to him like that or he wouldn't expect us to know about this sort of thing.
[3:57:01.340 --> 3:57:03.340]  You know what I mean Alex.
[3:57:03.340 --> 3:57:06.340]  Absolutely so how did it end.
[3:57:06.340 --> 3:57:23.340]  Well I continued talking with him and he left and he left and a police officer that had came there with him had pulled me aside and said you need to watch what you say and everything like that.
[3:57:23.340 --> 3:57:26.340]  Oh yeah in America you don't dare talk to a congressman.
[3:57:26.340 --> 3:57:30.340]  See I mean the police have been turned into nothing but secret police.
[3:57:30.340 --> 3:57:38.340]  Absolutely and here in Arkansas I remember hearing the gentleman on the phone saying about it unless you're in a cave or you can escape it.
[3:57:38.340 --> 3:57:48.340]  You really can't escape it because I have family from Southern Arkansas, Denmark, Arkansas, McGee Arkansas out there in the out there in those rural areas and everything like that.
[3:57:48.340 --> 3:57:53.340]  They're putting it in their heads like hey we're out we're out here to save you and everything.
[3:57:53.340 --> 3:57:56.340]  Come get this free free flu shot and everything like that.
[3:57:56.340 --> 3:57:57.340]  You know what I mean.
[3:57:57.340 --> 3:57:59.340]  We're here to we're here to help you.
[3:57:59.340 --> 3:58:00.340]  God bless you sir.
[3:58:00.340 --> 3:58:01.340]  I'm out of time.
[3:58:01.340 --> 3:58:02.340]  Yes they're brainwashing.
[3:58:02.340 --> 3:58:04.340]  Here's the bottom line.
[3:58:04.340 --> 3:58:05.340]  They're taking over the banks.
[3:58:05.340 --> 3:58:06.340]  They're taking over our society.
[3:58:06.340 --> 3:58:07.340]  They're plunging the dollar.
[3:58:07.340 --> 3:58:09.340]  They're bringing in tyranny.
[3:58:09.340 --> 3:58:16.340]  They need this flu as a pretext to clamp down with martial law during the fall of the Republic.
[3:58:16.340 --> 3:58:21.340]  And this next three four months is the most important time in history up until this point.
[3:58:21.340 --> 3:58:23.340]  It'll probably just get more serious after that.
[3:58:23.340 --> 3:58:30.340]  This is a key test for humanity to spread the word about how this flu is a hoax and nothing but a takeover cover.
