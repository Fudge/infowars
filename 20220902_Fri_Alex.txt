[00:00.000 --> 00:07.000]  As you can now see, America is going under total new of order martial law.
[00:07.000 --> 00:14.000]  Biden has literally given a speech declaring war on the people in a Hitlerian set.
[00:14.000 --> 00:16.000]  You don't want to miss his broadcast.
[00:16.000 --> 00:21.000]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:21.000 --> 00:26.000]  We must be honest with each other and with ourselves.
[00:26.000 --> 00:32.000]  Too much of what's happening in our country today is not normal.
[00:32.000 --> 00:42.000]  Donald Trump and the Maggie Republicans represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic.
[00:42.000 --> 00:47.000]  I want to be very clear, very clear up front.
[00:47.000 --> 00:53.000]  Not every Republican, not even the majority of Republicans are Maggie Republicans.
[00:53.000 --> 00:57.000]  Not every Republican embraces their extreme ideology.
[00:57.000 --> 01:02.000]  I know because I've been able to work with these mainstream Republicans.
[01:02.000 --> 01:06.000]  And here, in my view, is what is true.
[01:06.000 --> 01:10.000]  Maggie Republicans do not respect the Constitution.
[01:10.000 --> 01:12.000]  They do not believe in the rule of law.
[01:12.000 --> 01:15.000]  They do not recognize the will of the people.
[01:15.000 --> 01:19.000]  They refuse to accept the results of a free election.
[01:19.000 --> 01:24.000]  And they're working right now, as I speak, in state after state,
[01:24.000 --> 01:30.000]  to give power to decide elections in America to partisans and cronies,
[01:30.000 --> 01:35.000]  empowering election deniers to undermine democracy itself.
[01:35.000 --> 01:40.000]  MAGA forces are determined to take this country backwards,
[01:40.000 --> 01:46.000]  backwards to an America where there is no right to choose,
[01:46.000 --> 01:52.000]  no right to privacy, no right to contraception, no right to marry who you love.
[01:52.000 --> 01:57.000]  They promote authoritarian leaders and they fan the flames of political violence
[01:57.000 --> 02:03.000]  that are a threat to our personal rights, to the pursuit of justice,
[02:03.000 --> 02:09.000]  to the rule of law, to the very soul of this country.
[02:09.000 --> 02:20.000]  We here, you've heard it, more and more talk about violence as an acceptable political tool in this country.
[02:20.000 --> 02:25.000]  It's not. It can never be an acceptable tool.
[02:25.000 --> 02:27.000]  So I want to say this plain and simple.
[02:27.000 --> 02:33.000]  There is no place for political violence in America, period, none ever.
[02:33.000 --> 02:44.000]  You saw a law enforcement brutally attacked on January 6.
[02:44.000 --> 02:47.000]  We've seen election officials, poll workers, many of them volunteers,
[02:47.000 --> 02:52.000]  the both parties subject to intimidation and death threats.
[02:52.000 --> 02:54.000]  And can you believe it?
[02:54.000 --> 03:00.000]  FBI agents just doing their job as directed facing threats
[03:00.000 --> 03:04.000]  to their own lives from their own fellow citizens.
[03:04.000 --> 03:08.000]  On top of that, there are public figures today,
[03:08.000 --> 03:14.000]  yesterday and the day before predicting and all the calling for mass violence
[03:14.000 --> 03:16.000]  and rioting in the streets.
[03:16.000 --> 03:18.000]  This is inflammatory.
[03:18.000 --> 03:20.000]  It's dangerous.
[03:20.000 --> 03:22.000]  It's against the rule of law.
[03:22.000 --> 03:28.000]  And we, the people, must say this is not who we are.
[03:28.000 --> 03:38.000]  And now, America must choose to move forward or to move backwards,
[03:38.000 --> 03:42.000]  to build a future obsessed about the past,
[03:42.000 --> 03:46.000]  to be a nation of hope and unity and optimism,
[03:46.000 --> 03:51.000]  or a nation of fear, division, and of darkness.
[03:51.000 --> 03:59.000]  Niagara Republic has made their choice. They embrace anger. They thrive on chaos.
[03:59.000 --> 04:04.000]  They live not in the light of truth, but in the shadow of lies.
[04:04.000 --> 04:09.000]  But together, together we can choose a different path.
[04:09.000 --> 04:14.000]  We can choose a better path forward to the future,
[04:14.000 --> 04:19.000]  a future of possibility, a future to build and dream and hope.
[04:19.000 --> 04:22.000]  And we're on that path moving ahead.
[04:22.000 --> 04:25.000]  Everything he said is an inversion of the truth.
[04:25.000 --> 04:28.000]  I warned you he'd give a speech declaring war on America.
[04:28.000 --> 04:31.000]  They are locked and loaded to stage mass of terror attacks.
[04:31.000 --> 04:35.000]  This country is on the footsteps of doom.
[04:35.000 --> 04:39.000]  And everybody better get the word out that they're planning to stage violence.
[04:39.000 --> 04:42.000]  They're the ones preparing violence. They have the history of provocaturing.
[04:42.000 --> 04:45.000]  And you heard him with no proof say that Republicans are calling for violence.
[04:45.000 --> 04:48.000]  They had a bunch of national TV shows the last two days
[04:48.000 --> 04:51.000]  say I'm calling for violence when I'm calling for the opposite.
[04:51.000 --> 04:54.000]  These people are making their move on us.
[04:54.000 --> 05:19.000]  My God, with a fascist background, all they missed was the torches.
[05:19.000 --> 05:24.000]  It's the way it is in the world.
[05:24.000 --> 05:29.000]  But whatever you do, take a high quality multi vitamin mineral amino acid system
[05:29.000 --> 05:30.000]  like this.
[05:30.000 --> 05:34.000]  It's liquid that you put in water because you have a better absorption rate
[05:34.000 --> 05:35.000]  when you do that.
[05:35.000 --> 05:38.000]  Now, vitamin mineral fusion is our overall best selling product.
[05:38.000 --> 05:41.000]  It finally came in a month ago and we've almost sold out of the first shipment.
[05:41.000 --> 05:43.000]  Hopefully more is coming in a few months.
[05:43.000 --> 05:47.000]  But if you want to experience vitamin mineral fusion and its effects for yourself
[05:47.000 --> 05:50.760]  or maybe you already love it you want to stock up. Thanks for keeping us on the
[05:50.760 --> 05:53.480]  air and thanks for taking care of yourself and your body. We've all got to
[05:53.480 --> 05:57.800]  stick together. Vitamin mineral fusion is 40% off even though it's selling out at
[05:57.800 --> 06:20.280]  InfowarsStore.com. Thanks for your support.
[06:20.280 --> 06:33.280]  It is Friday, September 2nd 2022 and we are still at our post as loyal
[06:33.280 --> 06:38.120]  Americans to our republic and to our ancestors and to ourselves and to our
[06:38.120 --> 06:46.720]  children. Eye spider sense is tangling of imminent stage terror attacks but you
[06:46.720 --> 06:51.760]  don't need to have a sixth sense to know it. You can see everything being done
[06:51.760 --> 06:58.840]  everything being prepared launching not just America but the world into an
[06:58.840 --> 07:03.560]  authoritarian takeover. The energy is being cut off. The borders are being
[07:03.560 --> 07:08.000]  imploded. Pedophilia is out in the open. Hundreds of hospitals are chopping the
[07:08.000 --> 07:12.480]  penises and genitals off little boys and the breasts off little girls and those of
[07:12.480 --> 07:17.000]  us that say it's wrong are called terrorists. The enemy is making their
[07:17.000 --> 07:23.080]  move right now. This is an emergency broadcast ladies and gentlemen and I'll
[07:23.080 --> 07:27.680]  be up here tomorrow taping another emergency three-hour broadcast with some
[07:27.680 --> 07:31.980]  special guests. We're gonna be here today but with the storms across the
[07:31.980 --> 07:35.640]  country their plane is delayed until this evening I'll leave it at that
[07:35.640 --> 07:41.120]  special guest in studio tomorrow. We've got big guests as well in studio today a
[07:41.120 --> 07:44.760]  psychological warfare expert we're leading ones in the world. We'll be
[07:44.760 --> 07:51.280]  joining us to tell you about that coming up at the bottom of the hour. Ladies and
[07:51.280 --> 07:57.520]  gentlemen this is like if you go to the zoo and take your three-year-old you go
[07:57.520 --> 08:01.560]  that's an elephant honey and it's an elephant. There's no debating it's an
[08:01.560 --> 08:05.480]  elephant or that's a tiger or that's a giraffe or that's a grizzly bear or
[08:05.480 --> 08:10.000]  that's a penguin or that's a boa constrictor. When the leader of a
[08:10.000 --> 08:14.200]  country gets up and declares half the nation terrorist and says they're
[08:14.200 --> 08:19.160]  about to engage in terrorism and they do it with troops behind them with a red
[08:19.160 --> 08:25.840]  background with a with a dark cross above it in every Hollywood movie and
[08:25.840 --> 08:31.760]  every dystopian system they show that exact iconography all of it scripted by
[08:31.760 --> 08:43.240]  design. In FIFA Vendetta it's the exact set. When Trump simply had General
[08:43.240 --> 08:48.040]  Millie with him touring the burned down church by the White House the entire
[08:48.040 --> 08:52.200]  corporate media called it fascism and that Trump was about to attack everybody
[08:52.200 --> 08:57.320]  and that this was just Hitler had been reborn. No when people are burning down
[08:57.320 --> 09:01.080]  cities you then have the troops come out and you go and survey and say it won't
[09:01.080 --> 09:05.520]  be tolerated but when you go up on television with a red background at
[09:05.520 --> 09:11.360]  nighttime with troops behind you ladies and gentlemen Adolf Hitler wrote the
[09:11.360 --> 09:20.880]  book on it. These people don't wear a red armband with a black swastika on it
[09:20.880 --> 09:26.400]  they wear masks and they wear black hoods and they're anti-fa and they are
[09:26.400 --> 09:30.200]  taking over. We have all these new project Veritas videos undercover of
[09:30.200 --> 09:35.000]  corporate leaders school administrators bragging you name it. We're really
[09:35.000 --> 09:39.680]  double agents we're really secret agents taking over the children are ours. I
[09:39.680 --> 09:45.800]  have multiple clips just today of that. The average leftist has been converted
[09:45.800 --> 09:51.680]  into an operative and we still think we're in a free country and boys and
[09:51.680 --> 09:57.320]  girls we ain't. It's not just in Denver Colorado this week that they remote
[09:57.320 --> 10:00.680]  controlled everybody's thermostats and took control of them. It happened all
[10:00.680 --> 10:05.720]  over the world this week. The forced alerts on your phones all of it is the
[10:05.720 --> 10:11.080]  definition of a high-tech police state. That's why they have the war on the
[10:11.080 --> 10:15.320]  police to get rid of the existing police that follow the Constitution and
[10:15.320 --> 10:19.440]  Bill of Rights to some extent and are loyal to their communities and who are
[10:19.440 --> 10:24.440]  great people on average on average they're great people they are they just
[10:24.440 --> 10:28.440]  start like our veterans are they're under attack our veterans are under attack
[10:28.440 --> 10:32.840]  our police are under attack that's a real police state first thing Hitler did
[10:32.840 --> 10:36.240]  was take out all the loyal police from the Weimar Republic that wouldn't go
[10:36.240 --> 10:42.920]  along with him it took him a few years to do it. So ladies and gentlemen when
[10:42.920 --> 10:51.640]  they project big blood red lights on a wall with flags and troops at the ready
[10:51.640 --> 10:56.440]  they're saying we're coming for you and what it is I wouldn't be surprised if
[10:56.440 --> 11:01.840]  this doesn't have an operational name. In fact I bet it does. I bet it's called
[11:01.840 --> 11:10.720]  Operation Matador or Operation Bullfight. They see us as the bull and they are
[11:10.720 --> 11:17.360]  shaking a red flag in our face and the Matador is the deep state with a long
[11:17.360 --> 11:24.280]  skinny razor-sharp sword so that when the bull lunges forward the Matador uses
[11:24.280 --> 11:29.160]  the force of its weight to drive it into the heart and step aside with his cape
[11:29.160 --> 11:41.680]  as the bull buries himself into the dust. This is Operation Matador. This is
[11:41.680 --> 11:48.760]  Operation Matador and again I told you three days ago and two days ago and
[11:48.760 --> 11:55.600]  yesterday I said 100% he's gonna come out in the speech and declare war on half
[11:55.600 --> 11:59.520]  the country and say anybody that is a populist or a nationalist wants to
[11:59.520 --> 12:04.280]  destroy the country when they're the ones openly and publicly destroying the
[12:04.280 --> 12:08.120]  country and as if that wasn't bad enough we're gonna play all these clips the
[12:08.120 --> 12:15.320]  disgraced deputy FBI director came out and said this is everyone who's a
[12:15.320 --> 12:20.120]  Republican or supports Trump or a populist is an insurrectionist and
[12:20.120 --> 12:25.720]  needs to be dealt with and Biden should have declared more extensive war and
[12:25.720 --> 12:32.760]  made it clear. So that's all this is and the way you get a
[12:32.760 --> 12:41.760]  bull that outweighs the Matador 15 times and has big giant razor-sharp horns to
[12:41.760 --> 12:48.080]  finally run into the sword is they throw little spears into his back to piss
[12:48.080 --> 12:53.840]  him off and to anger him. That's what they've been doing with the open borders
[12:53.840 --> 12:57.160]  the drag queen story time that he valued dollars and shutting off your power
[12:57.160 --> 13:00.840]  supplies and remote controlling all the devices in your house we warned you 20
[13:00.840 --> 13:05.320]  years ago they would do and running down America and running down our families
[13:05.320 --> 13:11.520]  and having the NFL take a knee and all the rest of this garbage that was
[13:11.520 --> 13:17.720]  throwing the little spears the barbs in our back but now the red capes out with
[13:17.720 --> 13:22.560]  67 days out from the midterms where they know they're set to lose big despite
[13:22.560 --> 13:25.360]  all the dead people they've got on the rolls hoping they can steal it with
[13:25.360 --> 13:30.160]  mail-in ballots and so now the red cape is out being flapped in our face and
[13:30.160 --> 13:34.880]  right behind it is the FBI and the New World Order getting ready to stage terror
[13:34.880 --> 13:41.160]  attacks because they know we're not gonna jump on the sword populist Christians
[13:41.160 --> 13:45.160]  conservatives are too smart we actually work for a living we have children we
[13:45.160 --> 13:48.240]  live in the real world we study things we're involved we're not dumb-ass left
[13:48.240 --> 13:54.640]  us and so you can bet your bottom Benjamin you can bet everything you got
[13:54.640 --> 13:59.080]  on the fact that they're getting ready to stage horrible terror attacks in this
[13:59.080 --> 14:03.120]  country and when I came out last week and this week and said it's imminent
[14:03.120 --> 14:09.400]  they went completely ape and said Alex Jones is calling for violence and you
[14:09.400 --> 14:15.040]  heard Biden in his speech we're gonna play clip six here in a moment
[14:17.280 --> 14:24.560]  you heard Biden say that the Republicans are calling for mass unrest and
[14:24.560 --> 14:31.920]  violence no they're not they said if you indict Trump that could cause that and
[14:31.920 --> 14:35.520]  that's Lindsey Graham the deep stator Republicans aren't gonna what go riot
[14:35.520 --> 14:40.920]  our because we're gonna blame the local cops or the local or burn burn down a
[14:40.920 --> 14:49.200]  Walmart or maybe loot a target or a or a Versace no Republicans don't blame the
[14:49.200 --> 14:52.280]  local police department when you have a tyrannical federal government
[14:52.280 --> 14:56.400]  Republicans don't blame the average FBI agent Republicans aren't gonna blow up a
[14:56.400 --> 15:01.720]  federal building 2.0 Oklahoma City 95 Republicans aren't gonna shoot police
[15:01.720 --> 15:07.000]  officers Republicans aren't gonna go out and riot and attack police cars their
[15:07.000 --> 15:12.040]  brother or sister is probably in the damn car so when they sit there and tell
[15:12.040 --> 15:17.040]  you that we're about to riot and burn things down and carry out terror you
[15:17.040 --> 15:21.920]  can bet everything you've got on they've got their team set up and their
[15:21.920 --> 15:25.960]  antifa operatives ready to pose and ready to provocateur and ready to
[15:25.960 --> 15:33.120]  launch it imminently imminently because they know they've lost and they want to
[15:33.120 --> 15:35.880]  have a smoke screen of violence to bring in martial law and they've got
[15:35.880 --> 15:42.240]  everything set up for it and the pedophile run yet you know Jeffrey
[15:42.240 --> 15:47.720]  Epstein New World Order knows their backs against the wall
[15:47.720 --> 15:53.200]  so we go through the speech by every facet of this but this broadcast was
[15:53.200 --> 15:57.080]  forged in the fires of liberty and we were designed admit for the moment we're
[15:57.080 --> 16:04.560]  here now together just look at these headlines from Reuters world faces

[20:41.040 --> 20:47.800]  speech I'm gonna open the phones up specifically on that declaration of
[20:47.800 --> 20:53.920]  war against the American people yesterday and what it really signifies
[20:53.920 --> 20:58.960]  everything he says is what they're doing to us everything he's saying is
[20:58.960 --> 21:05.640]  classical authoritarianism pure bread 200 proof if it was liquor it'd be it'd
[21:05.640 --> 21:10.640]  be a hundred percent alcohol I mean it is it is it is abs I mean it would win
[21:10.640 --> 21:16.800]  best of show if it was a dog I mean it is the bonafide the third of bread the
[21:16.800 --> 21:22.840]  red flag in your face our political enemies must be shut down they're
[21:22.840 --> 21:26.600]  planning terror we're gonna get them I've got the military behind me I'm
[21:26.600 --> 21:30.240]  standing here in a nighttime ceremony with red light on the walls I mean it's
[21:30.240 --> 21:39.000]  it's just ridiculous it is absolutely ridiculous when you think of classic
[21:39.000 --> 21:48.200]  beautiful bombshell you think Marilyn Monroe right you think rockstar you
[21:48.200 --> 21:55.080]  think Elvis Presley when you think Hitler when you think Stalin when you
[21:55.080 --> 22:02.360]  think tyranny why do you think this set is a simulation of nuclear war and as
[22:02.360 --> 22:07.040]  fascist red on black because when they're doing this we put on the set the
[22:07.040 --> 22:13.840]  colors they put those colors up folks I'm telling you it's coming and now it's
[22:13.840 --> 22:21.640]  here in every Hollywood movie it's black on red in a nighttime speech with the
[22:21.640 --> 22:29.600]  leader in a dark suit shaking his fists both fists I mean this was scripted this
[22:29.600 --> 22:39.040]  was choreographed this was unbelievable they even had a red cross up in the dark
[22:39.040 --> 22:42.760]  above him and that photo it's a little bit higher you can't see it but I mean
[22:42.760 --> 22:48.280]  this is just ridiculous he only if he wore a red armband with a swastika and
[22:48.280 --> 22:54.640]  said how Hitler would this be any more obvious I mean this is just unbelievable
[22:55.560 --> 23:03.360]  this is just absolutely saying we are targeting you you're in a crosshair the
[23:03.360 --> 23:06.920]  military is watching you we're gonna censor you we're gonna lock you up and
[23:06.920 --> 23:11.400]  then the former deputy director of the FBI play the clip next segment comes out
[23:11.400 --> 23:16.040]  and says this isn't enough we need to target all the insurrectionists we need
[23:16.040 --> 23:19.280]  to arrest everybody
[23:22.880 --> 23:29.280]  so how are they gonna legitimize this why do you make an announcement this
[23:29.280 --> 23:36.480]  bold and crazy because they're gonna pull stuff so damn horrible and they're
[23:36.480 --> 23:43.240]  gonna go ahead and make their move on everybody they'll assassinate Trump
[23:43.240 --> 23:52.120]  they'll they'll come kill me and then they're gonna come for you they're making
[23:52.120 --> 24:00.960]  their move and they're insane that it will fail it will blow up and they'll get
[24:00.960 --> 24:04.000]  the war they keep talking about which I don't want because that's part of the
[24:04.000 --> 24:08.600]  new order plan to take the United States out we are literally at the end of
[24:08.600 --> 24:13.800]  America right now with a crazy dimension riddled person trying to be a
[24:13.800 --> 24:16.800]  dictator and the people behind him Obama and the globalist they are
[24:16.800 --> 24:26.280]  dictators and they stole the election to install him so I told you the last month
[24:26.280 --> 24:32.080]  my gut level also intellectual analysis is 10 times worse than it's ever been I
[24:32.080 --> 24:38.880]  mean 10 times more intense 10 times more concerned I'm guaranteeing you okay
[24:38.880 --> 24:45.480]  guaranteeing you that unless we see massive Justice Department whistleblowers
[24:45.480 --> 24:48.480]  now and unless we see people even in corporate media that know their
[24:48.480 --> 24:51.960]  mercenaries and know what they're doing is wrong and a lot of them do unless we
[24:51.960 --> 24:57.640]  just see everybody start coming out and saying I'm not with this it's over and
[24:57.640 --> 25:00.120]  again well people say well we'll just have a war with these people and we'll
[25:00.120 --> 25:05.480]  show them that's the plan we don't want to have a war with these psychos we'll
[25:05.480 --> 25:11.600]  beat them but in the process it'll be a Perik victory and a Perik victory is
[25:11.600 --> 25:18.160]  where you win the battle and think you win the war but you lose because of what
[25:18.160 --> 25:33.800]  the war did to you when I first opened the phones up I want to hear from current
[25:33.800 --> 25:37.120]  serving military and police let me say where you're from or any of that you
[25:37.120 --> 25:41.600]  can just say anonymous if you want and I want to get your take I want to hear
[25:41.600 --> 25:45.640]  from the first bank of callers being police and military because you're
[25:45.640 --> 25:49.680]  gonna be asked to enforce this nightmare what do you think of this what do
[25:49.680 --> 25:53.080]  you think we can do peacefully to stop this nightmare and then after we take
[25:53.080 --> 25:56.680]  10-15 calls from military law enforcement the next wave of calls will be
[25:56.680 --> 26:00.920]  first-time callers long-time callers you agree you disagree whatever open phones
[26:00.920 --> 26:06.280]  on this subject on this declaration of war against anybody that questions the
[26:06.280 --> 26:09.640]  new world order anybody that wants to save the country anybody that doesn't
[26:09.640 --> 26:15.280]  want to bankrupt and dissolve the republic as we know it go ahead and go to
[26:15.280 --> 26:19.160]  clip seven I hear he is saying the republicans are calling for violence
[26:19.160 --> 26:24.680]  which they're not and here in my view is what is true
[26:24.680 --> 26:30.400]  Maggard republicans do not respect the Constitution they do not believe in the
[26:30.400 --> 26:35.680]  rule of law they did not recognize the will of the people they refuse to accept
[26:35.680 --> 26:41.440]  the results of a free election and they're working right now as I speak in
[26:41.440 --> 26:47.320]  state after state to give power to decide elections in America to
[26:47.320 --> 26:52.960]  partisans and cronies empowering election deniers to undermine democracy
[26:52.960 --> 27:01.000]  itself maga forces are determined to take this country backwards backwards to
[27:01.000 --> 27:07.960]  America where there is no right to choose no right to privacy no right to
[27:07.960 --> 27:13.480]  contraception no right to marry who you love they promote authoritarian leaders
[27:13.480 --> 27:18.520]  and they fan the flames of political violence that are a threat to our
[27:18.520 --> 27:24.520]  personal rights to the pursuit of justice to the rule of law to the very
[27:24.520 --> 27:32.960]  soul of this country who is fanning the flames of violence who is dividing the
[27:32.960 --> 27:37.760]  country who is running the nation under the ground everything he said was what
[27:37.760 --> 27:41.600]  they're doing I've got more clips of this when we come back and the former
[27:41.600 --> 27:44.760]  deputy director of the FBI saying you didn't go far enough we're gonna play it
[27:44.760 --> 27:49.960]  all but this is an attempt to outlaw the political peaceful realignment that's
[27:49.960 --> 27:54.520]  happening and patriots preparing according to all the numbers to take the
[27:54.520 --> 27:57.200]  Senate in the house that's what they're putting out polls and numbers oh they
[27:57.200 --> 28:00.680]  won't get the Senate they'll barely get the house because they're doing the
[28:00.680 --> 28:04.200]  mail-in ballots again does anybody believe that the first time in 50 years
[28:04.200 --> 28:10.720]  a Democrat got elected in Alaska and that Sarah Palin really lost in that
[28:10.720 --> 28:18.200]  special election no they stole it we know they rewrote last year the zoning
[28:18.200 --> 28:22.480]  and the gerrymandering of the districts and we know that they did mail-in
[28:22.480 --> 28:28.120]  ballots they did it again they're gonna do it again and become a permanent
[28:28.120 --> 28:39.520]  uniparty like Venezuela or North Korea a hellish spectacle was a wartime
[28:39.520 --> 28:47.040]  speech says town hall absolutely it was a declaration of war against Americans
[28:47.040 --> 28:50.000]  that don't want to flush the country down the toilet but we can stop it
[28:50.000 --> 28:55.560]  together and we can raise the alarm but I need everybody to get engaged now

[33:06.160 --> 33:20.800]  Jones
[33:20.800 --> 33:27.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny
[33:27.480 --> 33:37.320]  well so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones even ABC
[33:37.320 --> 33:45.080]  news CNN the Washington Post called it a declaration of war a wartime speech
[33:45.080 --> 33:51.080]  hellish these are quotes we just had some on screen for TV viewers even main
[33:51.080 --> 33:58.200]  line liberals are like what in the world was that because it's so flagrant it's
[33:58.200 --> 34:05.480]  so out in the open it's so fascist it's so authoritarian it is overkill and
[34:05.480 --> 34:12.000]  people say this makes him look like a crazy man but you see he needs to get
[34:12.000 --> 34:17.200]  ahead of it before they stage the false flags they've got a history of it it's
[34:17.200 --> 34:21.800]  one of the only cards they've got to play brace yourselves and the big question
[34:21.800 --> 34:28.560]  is how do we get the word out about this so they don't pull it off you can
[34:28.560 --> 34:32.400]  expose it we can expose it we can make this the number one issue and how they
[34:32.400 --> 34:36.760]  stage the Whitmer kidnapping how they provocateur January 6th how they ran
[34:36.760 --> 34:39.720]  Oklahoma City how they've stayed so many other events that's why they don't want
[34:39.720 --> 34:44.040]  us on air because we understand that low level you got Jesse Small but high
[34:44.040 --> 34:49.360]  level you got the FBI doing things far worse with these special units yeah the
[34:49.360 --> 34:52.880]  average FBI agent involved in this they're in money laundering and kidnapping
[34:52.880 --> 34:59.040]  cases but the special unit that ran the Whitmer kidnapping in January 6th and
[34:59.040 --> 35:03.280]  the raid on Marlago and the Russiagate group is the same group and you know
[35:03.280 --> 35:10.760]  it's them I'll guarantee you they got the trucks loaded with fuel oil bombs right
[35:10.760 --> 35:16.600]  now I guarantee you they're gonna run the same place again they did in 95 but if
[35:16.600 --> 35:21.440]  we put enough heat on them and have enough of their minions they're trying
[35:21.440 --> 35:26.720]  to set up as the Patsy's learn about this it'll neutralize them here's a great
[35:26.720 --> 35:33.600]  example I'll go the clips in early February of this year just about two
[35:33.600 --> 35:37.760]  weeks before the Russians invaded Ukraine the State Department the CIA told
[35:37.760 --> 35:43.320]  the truth they said Russia is massing trips to the border and massing blood
[35:43.320 --> 35:50.800]  and massing ambulances and they're planning an invasion to split the
[35:50.800 --> 35:55.400]  country in two now just because they lie most of the time doesn't mean they
[35:55.400 --> 35:59.640]  didn't tell the truth when it was about to actually happen because they don't
[35:59.640 --> 36:03.800]  control what Russia's gonna do but they were picking the chatter up and what did
[36:03.800 --> 36:07.680]  they say at the State Department the former high-level CIA operative that's
[36:07.680 --> 36:11.400]  the spokesperson there he said we have intel that Russia is about the stage
[36:11.400 --> 36:16.200]  false flags car bombings and shootings to blame Ukraine as a pretext to invade
[36:16.200 --> 36:20.920]  and it does appear that there were some car bombs and things that went off right
[36:20.920 --> 36:24.680]  when the Russians invaded that was the pretext because that's what big
[36:24.680 --> 36:29.320]  governments do Hitler staged attacks on his own troops on the border with Poland
[36:29.320 --> 36:38.840]  at Gliwitz in 1940 before World War two kicked off so again why did the State
[36:38.840 --> 36:42.200]  Department come out and say Russia's preparing false flags and remember at
[36:42.200 --> 36:45.160]  the State Department briefings they said this is Alex Jones territory the
[36:45.160 --> 36:49.000]  Reuters reporters said this is Alex Jones stuff false flags don't exist what
[36:49.000 --> 36:54.240]  do you mean they don't exist how we get to Vietnam Gulf of Tonkin how they plan
[36:54.240 --> 36:58.320]  to go to war with Russia in 61 but Kennedy killed the plan operation
[36:58.320 --> 37:03.920]  Northwoods how how we go to war in 1990 with with Iraq they said that the they
[37:03.920 --> 37:14.560]  were beating babies brains out and incubators so there's a good chance we
[37:14.560 --> 37:19.520]  can stop them if people understand they've got the ace of spades in their
[37:19.520 --> 37:24.960]  hand which is false flags and they're priming it and saying Republicans and
[37:24.960 --> 37:28.400]  Trump supporters are about to shoot things and blow things up which we know
[37:28.400 --> 37:31.800]  is it true and it's so obvious they've got all this lined up they're getting
[37:31.800 --> 37:40.040]  ready to do it you don't have to be a rocket scientist to know that so that's
[37:40.040 --> 37:43.920]  the big thing I wanted to get out now I'm gonna give the number out I'm gonna
[37:43.920 --> 37:45.960]  play some of these clips right now then I'm gonna come right back and take your
[37:45.960 --> 37:53.160]  calls from military and law enforcement first on this subject of the false flag
[37:53.160 --> 37:56.600]  and last night's speech and what you think of the situation that we take
[37:56.600 --> 38:00.040]  whatever calls come in from military law enforcement then the phones will open
[38:00.040 --> 38:06.680]  up for everybody the toll free number to join us is 877-789-2539 877-789
[38:06.680 --> 38:14.760]  Alex 877-789-2539 in no matter how important the call is maximum two
[38:14.760 --> 38:17.360]  minutes of caller because I want to get to everybody we've been doing a pretty
[38:17.360 --> 38:21.120]  good job lately of actually getting the most the callers so folks don't have to
[38:21.120 --> 38:24.240]  hold who I know we're busy but we need to hear from you we want to hear from you
[38:24.240 --> 38:31.600]  one of outside is off of you 877-789-2539 but in the last few days I've
[38:31.600 --> 38:36.120]  talked to high-level current Pentagon and high level current CIA and high level
[38:36.120 --> 38:42.320]  Army special operations command and they concur with my analysis 100% say it's
[38:42.320 --> 38:46.440]  their analysis and that America's never been in more trouble but obviously those
[38:46.440 --> 38:50.720]  people can't come on the show but I can tell you that people that have done this
[38:50.720 --> 38:54.600]  in third world countries and people that have run regime change agree there's an
[38:54.600 --> 38:58.520]  attempt by the leftist arm of the deep state to stage events and permanently
[38:58.520 --> 39:02.960]  bring America into martial law if you think the censorship and arrest have
[39:02.960 --> 39:07.040]  been bad so far you see nothing yet so this country is on the edge of ending
[39:07.040 --> 39:11.240]  as we know it they know they've lost politically they know they're about to
[39:11.240 --> 39:14.480]  lose the election so they are getting ready to stage something huge ladies and
[39:14.480 --> 39:17.720]  gentlemen so the public would at least buy that oh because of the big terror
[39:17.720 --> 39:22.160]  attack or whatever or terror attacks or mass shootings or mass poisonings or
[39:22.160 --> 39:25.520]  power outages or whatever it is they're gearing up to do there's a plethora of
[39:25.520 --> 39:33.920]  things they can do within the false flag realm and so I'm just going to be
[39:33.920 --> 39:38.480]  every day on this until the election because they'll want a few weeks to
[39:38.480 --> 39:47.400]  maximize it I'd say we enter the prime zone October 1st and October after and
[39:47.400 --> 39:49.920]  they may go ahead and just start stuff up now and then they may do a bunch of
[39:49.920 --> 39:54.160]  attacks they may do one big giant attack they may do five six big attacks but
[39:54.160 --> 39:59.400]  you just better believe the truck bombs are loaded okay you better believe the
[39:59.400 --> 40:03.960]  mentally ill schizophrenic mass shooters are being programmed and drugged up and
[40:03.960 --> 40:09.520]  are in government CCIA new world order programming centers MK ultra operations
[40:09.520 --> 40:14.640]  right now the Manchurian candidates are ready they are rolling out guaranteed
[40:14.640 --> 40:18.160]  you can bet your bottom dollar just like the State Department said the Russians
[40:18.160 --> 40:21.800]  are getting ready to stage stuff and the evidence is they did and I'm not for
[40:21.800 --> 40:25.560]  the Russians I'm not for the deep state here I'm for America and future and
[40:25.560 --> 40:30.720]  peace but a lot of people hate our government so much it's so corrupt and
[40:30.720 --> 40:33.160]  overrun they think then everything the Russians do is perfect and that's not the
[40:33.160 --> 40:37.640]  case either the Russians are just wrote the book on false flags under the Zars
[40:37.640 --> 40:43.120]  and I only raised the Russian issue so that people get it your head this is
[40:43.120 --> 40:47.840]  real okay before you launch a war you stage false flags that's the first thing
[40:47.840 --> 40:53.080]  you do because nobody wants to say they started a war bad guys start wars so
[40:53.080 --> 41:00.840]  every time a war gets launched by bad guys they stage an event my uncle and
[41:00.840 --> 41:05.440]  my family in Vietnam weren't bad guys but the LBJ was a bad guy stage in the
[41:05.440 --> 41:10.520]  Gulf of Tonkin it didn't happen they're getting a new Gulf of Tonkin ready and
[41:10.520 --> 41:13.520]  who have they said the enemy is conservatives Christians nationalists
[41:13.520 --> 41:19.080]  patriots Trump supporters Republicans and so he's up there and I'll speech
[41:19.080 --> 41:23.480]  saying no less than seven times I've got clips the Republicans are about to get
[41:23.480 --> 41:26.480]  violent the Republicans are about to launch attacks the Republicans are
[41:26.480 --> 41:31.720]  about to do all this it's ridiculous how obvious this is you'd have to be a
[41:31.720 --> 41:37.600]  low-grade moron not to see it that's what I'm saying it's guaranteed now that
[41:37.600 --> 41:42.160]  speech last night with the military behind him says and when we stage these
[41:42.160 --> 41:45.160]  attacks we're coming after all the opposition that's what they're saying
[41:45.160 --> 41:50.440]  and they are pissed that we're on air exposing it because this is our real
[41:50.440 --> 41:55.360]  shot at stopping these people and thank God even a lot of big Democrats are
[41:55.360 --> 41:59.160]  going what the hell was that yeah guys you're not just gonna take the country
[41:59.160 --> 42:06.000]  over you're gonna start a giant civil war for real stop it anybody that wants
[42:06.000 --> 42:10.120]  to have a future for their children does not want this new world order takeover
[42:10.120 --> 42:17.280]  of tyranny and collapse and inflation and depression and just crime and
[42:17.280 --> 42:21.880]  insecurity ninety nine point nine nine nine percent of people are gonna be hurt
[42:21.880 --> 42:24.560]  by this so I don't care if you're a Democrat I don't care if you're a
[42:24.560 --> 42:28.160]  Republican I don't care if you're gay or straight black or white I don't care
[42:28.160 --> 42:33.960]  this is not good this is historically dangerous this is cancer we don't want
[42:33.960 --> 42:38.480]  this we already have them surround the Capitol with 30,000 troops and put up
[42:38.480 --> 42:42.400]  the fences and just all of this getting you ready for this next big move

[47:29.240 --> 47:33.400]  his publicly declared war on his political opposition this is the stuff
[47:33.400 --> 47:37.800]  of history but it's not in the past it's now happening in the present ladies

[47:49.400 --> 47:56.240]  anybody that disagrees with us is a fascist Biden didn't go far enough says
[47:56.240 --> 48:01.880]  the disgrace of McCabe they are trying to make it look like we're violent and
[48:01.880 --> 48:06.200]  that we're about to have a confrontation with them as their pretext it they
[48:06.200 --> 48:12.360]  now said it and the mainline Twitter minions and others are calling for
[48:12.360 --> 48:18.120]  killing their opposition everywhere now and they're allowed to do it by big tech
[48:18.120 --> 48:21.960]  they tip their hand three years ago when they said we have a new level of banning
[48:21.960 --> 48:26.440]  for 12 individuals myself Lewis Faircon Paul Watson and some others have
[48:26.440 --> 48:30.880]  McGinnis and they said you're allowed to call for violence against these
[48:30.880 --> 48:36.880]  individuals but you're not allowed to defend them and then they withdrew it
[48:36.880 --> 48:42.160]  after a week that was a public policy of Mark Zuckerberg who put in 50 million
[48:42.160 --> 48:45.960]  dollars to help steal the election and now admits he works for the FBI to
[48:45.960 --> 48:54.920]  suppress Hunter Biden evil these people mean business and it's outrageous what
[48:54.920 --> 48:58.600]  they're doing but there are more and more Democrats coming out saying whoa this
[48:58.600 --> 49:03.640]  is not good let's stop this yes let's stop this I don't want to fight with you
[49:03.640 --> 49:08.920]  people and I can also look at the situation and tell you you're gonna lose
[49:08.920 --> 49:12.960]  if you get what you want but the globalists are gonna win this is so
[49:12.960 --> 49:18.160]  bad all right let's go to your calls we got Tony Kevin Kent Larry Joe John and
[49:18.160 --> 49:22.800]  others military veterans homeland security Marines you name it Tony is a
[49:22.800 --> 49:27.460]  15-year homeland security and he wants to give us his view on this for Washington
[49:27.460 --> 49:32.080]  DC go ahead Tony hey how you doing Alan say God bless you once again but hey I'm
[49:32.080 --> 49:35.320]  calling because I'm 15 year former federal employee we're for Custom
[49:35.320 --> 49:39.560]  Border Protection we're for ICE but I'm calling in regard to the one time thing
[49:39.560 --> 49:43.120]  about everything it's coming about as you know six months ago I walked away
[49:43.120 --> 49:47.040]  from the federal government they wanted us to do the vaccine mandates and I told
[49:47.040 --> 49:51.800]  Secretary Muir my my orcas send an email there's about 9 to 12% of us who
[49:51.800 --> 49:54.960]  walk away but there will be there will be something coming every couple months
[49:54.960 --> 49:58.840]  which I got numerous other memos when I still work there and more likely it's
[49:58.840 --> 50:02.160]  gonna be a nuclear bomb minus the plutonium or the uranium it's gonna be
[50:02.160 --> 50:05.960]  set off and that's gonna be one of the new set of lockdowns it's more it's gonna
[50:05.960 --> 50:11.520]  be set off better I agree I agree suitcase nukes power outages hack attacks
[50:11.520 --> 50:14.560]  they blame on the Russians I believe all that's in the cards but that's what
[50:14.560 --> 50:17.720]  you guys are getting briefed on it's one of the things we're getting briefed on
[50:17.720 --> 50:20.480]  but but minus the radiation still there actually won't be no radiation that's
[50:20.480 --> 50:23.260]  gonna be set off it's all gonna be and that's coming one of where one of the
[50:23.260 --> 50:27.000]  way that they said with the vaccine one of the way they fear people some people
[50:27.000 --> 50:30.320]  are gonna be also afraid to say it's nuclear but it's really classic
[50:30.320 --> 50:36.040]  explosive or are you saying it's gonna be a neutron bomb we got supplies for the
[50:36.040 --> 50:38.200]  last two years they've been they've been planning this stuff for the last two
[50:38.200 --> 50:41.920]  years we got as you know about the body bags I mean myself my former office we
[50:41.920 --> 50:46.240]  had over 200,000 body bags all over the whole entire spot you know they're
[50:46.240 --> 50:49.720]  saying it's a nuclear bomb minus radiation that's a neutron bomb which is
[50:49.720 --> 50:53.320]  Kissinger and Brzezinski are obsessed with neutron bombs and he populated
[50:53.320 --> 50:57.120]  America that's really their secret plans to detonate neutron bombs in the main
[50:57.120 --> 51:00.320]  population centers and as you know it doesn't destroy any infrastructure but
[51:00.320 --> 51:04.960]  kills all life 100% and it's also to shoot fear into the people's minds and
[51:04.960 --> 51:08.160]  that's one of the ways they're gonna feel the next next I want to be clear so
[51:08.160 --> 51:13.920]  they told you they described a neutron bomb yes yes we we we got flooded
[51:13.920 --> 51:17.160]  inside our office with all the stuff for the radiation we got all the new type
[51:17.160 --> 51:19.800]  of radiation so we have these little beepers when I was a custom board
[51:19.800 --> 51:23.120]  protection to show what the radiation levels are but safe to go outside and
[51:23.120 --> 51:28.160]  we actually had a test so it sure in New York is running drills for nuke attack
[51:28.160 --> 51:32.480]  yes yes that is correct but the radiation things in your belt if it's
[51:32.480 --> 51:35.280]  within 10 you're supposed to back up to a goes down a nine but we got all this
[51:35.280 --> 51:38.960]  radiation stuff more probably millions and millions all but I want to touch
[51:38.960 --> 51:42.280]  based on I know I have two minutes real quick Alex but the vaccine the whole
[51:42.280 --> 51:45.660]  vaccine which a lot of you guys don't realize this anything comes in the
[51:45.660 --> 51:51.640]  country land see or air has to be cream a custom board of protection and I see I
[51:51.640 --> 51:54.800]  personally sees over a hundred thousand vaccines these are anywhere was a market
[51:54.800 --> 51:57.920]  there's also a black market these vaccines were a hundred thousand they're
[51:57.920 --> 52:04.000]  going to CVS Walgreens and CVS Walgreens in Costco all right listen Tony I love
[52:04.000 --> 52:07.800]  you appreciate you be safe brother that's what they did the vaccine mandate
[52:07.800 --> 52:12.240]  was to get the good people out Kevin in Ohio Marine let's talk about martial law
[52:12.240 --> 52:15.640]  what do you make of that incredible declaration of war against America last
[52:15.640 --> 52:20.400]  night even the Washington Post says it's a declaration of war absolutely Alex
[52:20.400 --> 52:26.760]  it's great to talk to you my personal opinion is that they're bringing the
[52:26.760 --> 52:31.760]  borders wide open and if you notice there's a lot of Ukrainians coming through
[52:31.760 --> 52:36.600]  there and they're you going to use these Ukrainians because biting has
[52:36.600 --> 52:40.320]  connections with those people the Russians have warned that Ukrainians may
[52:40.320 --> 52:43.520]  stage false flags in Europe and America and I agree that they would they would
[52:43.520 --> 52:48.280]  stand again from it and they're going to dress them up in Trump Trump gear and
[52:48.280 --> 52:55.320]  have them do some stuff and bam martial law and also at the same time you have
[52:55.320 --> 52:58.960]  all these people from the Middle East coming through the southern border they'll
[52:58.960 --> 53:03.600]  gonna let them through thousands of days thousands a day including thousands of
[53:03.600 --> 53:10.720]  terrorists total I submit and IVs and suicide vests watch watch and see you
[53:10.720 --> 53:14.600]  remember that movie I can't remember what was called but it was about the Navy
[53:14.600 --> 53:19.960]  Seals and then how the they were sending those people through with vests yeah and
[53:19.960 --> 53:22.960]  they were trying to stop them they were telling you that's how that's what's
[53:22.960 --> 53:26.840]  gonna happen I mean they tell you in Hollywood just no doubt America's under
[53:26.840 --> 53:30.560]  attack by all sides and the globalist are planning asymmetrical warfare to
[53:30.560 --> 53:33.360]  blame on their domestic enemy but that actually lets them take over I totally
[53:33.360 --> 53:38.440]  agree absolutely Alex and and you know your spot on man and I've been listed
[53:38.440 --> 53:42.800]  for 15 years man you're the man well no you're the man brother what I'm asking
[53:42.800 --> 53:47.400]  you is what can we do to stop this because the State Department tried to
[53:47.400 --> 53:50.640]  stop Russia invading by saying they were gonna fall slide which was true I
[53:50.640 --> 53:57.760]  mean I think exposing this has got to have some effect well I I mean the
[53:57.760 --> 54:02.200]  border patrols doing the best they can you know without they need to send the
[54:02.200 --> 54:05.920]  first Marine division and put it on the damn border exactly they don't need them
[54:05.920 --> 54:09.680]  threatening the American people imagine how those Marines feel out there and
[54:09.680 --> 54:12.600]  that red lighting with Biden threatening the American people with Marines behind
[54:12.600 --> 54:17.520]  him that is disgusting thanks for the call absolutely disgusting let's talk to
[54:17.520 --> 54:22.720]  another Marine let's talk to John in New York go ahead you're on the air yeah
[54:22.720 --> 54:26.840]  good morning Alex one thing I want to say we probably don't need this orange
[54:26.840 --> 54:30.760]  guy back in office we don't need people arguing Alan he never did anything he
[54:30.760 --> 54:34.640]  said he was gonna do a locker up drain the swamp build a wall he didn't do any of
[54:34.640 --> 54:39.440]  it how come we never seen the footage of when Trump was asked why he's only got a
[54:39.440 --> 54:44.960]  bill the wall four and a half feet high well what is your view on the speech
[54:44.960 --> 54:48.440]  last night though I mean Biden says Republicans are about the state's terror
[54:48.440 --> 54:53.280]  attacks they stand again from it's very obvious they're preparing us all right
[54:53.280 --> 54:56.720]  well like you said Alex and you've been saying it for a long time now that we're
[54:56.720 --> 55:00.360]  probably gonna be hit with some type of nuclear bomb that doesn't contain all the
[55:00.360 --> 55:03.600]  other destructive thoughts it's just gonna eliminate life leave the basic
[55:03.600 --> 55:07.500]  structure form in place so that they could come in and take it over these
[55:07.500 --> 55:12.520]  200,000 body bags this very disturbing stuff to know and to hear let alone on
[55:12.520 --> 55:16.120]  your airwaves that are gonna be silent Alex we need to know God forbid if
[55:16.120 --> 55:20.520]  anything happens to you where do we go Alex brother I don't mean they take the
[55:20.520 --> 55:24.800]  grid down we're all we'll go dark and that's all everybody's on their own at
[55:24.800 --> 55:28.480]  that point with just God in your family that's why people need to realize we are
[55:28.480 --> 55:34.480]  in maximum maximum danger I bless you I appreciate your call all right let's go
[55:34.480 --> 55:41.280]  ahead and take another call let's jam in Kent in Texas go ahead Kent
[55:41.280 --> 55:51.480]  hey Alex first I'm caller first thing I want to ask is Biden is going to use
[55:51.480 --> 55:56.600]  executive orders to do anything that he wants he's good when the election comes
[55:56.600 --> 56:06.000]  along he's gonna require us to have a shot how in the heck are we even gonna
[56:06.000 --> 56:17.520]  win this and I don't see anywhere to go I mean there's no way to run except God
[56:17.520 --> 56:23.800]  he's the only safe place to go I totally agree with you brother what do you make
[56:23.800 --> 56:27.360]  of that speech last night I mean that was just out in the open saying
[56:27.360 --> 56:30.760]  Republicans are gonna blow things up with no evidence then they stand again
[56:30.760 --> 56:35.960]  they stage it they blame us it's very amateur but it's it's obvious and I
[56:35.960 --> 56:41.120]  don't know I don't know what we do yeah and at first I thought you know these
[56:41.120 --> 56:47.560]  are just fear tactics but I don't think so you can smell it last night look
[56:47.560 --> 56:52.760]  they're going for it and and so what do we do to get him to stop I mean I think
[56:52.760 --> 56:56.440]  a lot of the minions of the system no no how do you imagine being an FBI agent
[56:56.440 --> 56:59.000]  they're gonna try to have a march out with the military against American people
[56:59.000 --> 57:02.440]  it's meant to destroy all of us it's meant to kill them and kill us it's so
[57:02.440 --> 57:13.720]  ridiculous yeah yeah it really is this is just absolutely crazy I want to say
[57:13.720 --> 57:19.840]  run to God save yourself I agree with you Kent thank you all right I'm gonna

[1:00:39.280 --> 1:00:58.280]  I'm a special guest in studio but here's Vifer from data that really lays out we're dealing with
[1:00:58.280 --> 1:01:17.720]  still does that's close enough inspector we're not wired I'm sorry but a man in
[1:01:17.720 --> 1:01:22.320]  my position survives by taking every precaution you've information for us now
[1:01:22.320 --> 1:01:25.720]  you already have the information all the names and dates are inside your head
[1:01:25.720 --> 1:01:31.880]  what you want what you really need is a story story can be true or false I live
[1:01:31.880 --> 1:01:38.680]  such judgments to you inspector our story begins as these stories often do
[1:01:38.680 --> 1:01:44.400]  with a young up and coming politician he's deeply religious man and a member
[1:01:44.400 --> 1:01:48.520]  of the conservative party he's completely single-minded and has no
[1:01:48.520 --> 1:01:52.960]  regard for political process the more power he attains the more obvious is
[1:01:52.960 --> 1:01:59.120]  the more aggressive his supporters become eventually his party launches a
[1:01:59.120 --> 1:02:04.240]  special project in the name of national security first it's believed to be a
[1:02:04.240 --> 1:02:09.040]  search for biological weapons and it's pursued without regard to its cost
[1:02:09.040 --> 1:02:14.600]  however the true goal of this project is power complete and total hegemonic
[1:02:14.600 --> 1:02:21.280]  domination the project however ends violently but the efforts of those
[1:02:21.280 --> 1:02:26.080]  involved are not in vain a new ability to wage war is born from the blood of
[1:02:26.080 --> 1:02:32.320]  one of the victims imagine a virus the most terrifying virus you can and then
[1:02:32.320 --> 1:02:36.880]  imagine that you and you alone have the cure but if your ultimate goal is power
[1:02:36.880 --> 1:02:42.920]  how best to use such a weapon was at this point in our story that along comes
[1:02:42.920 --> 1:02:48.000]  a spider he is a man seemingly without a conscience for whom the ends always
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:51.800]  justify the means and it is he who suggests that their target should not
[1:02:51.800 --> 1:02:56.280]  be an enemy of the country but rather the country itself three targets are
[1:02:56.280 --> 1:02:59.800]  chosen to maximize the effect of the attack a school a tube station and a
[1:02:59.800 --> 1:03:04.360]  water treatment plant several hundred die within the first few weeks that
[1:03:04.360 --> 1:03:07.960]  three waters has in fact been contaminated authorities are attempting to
[1:03:07.960 --> 1:03:11.640]  control its deadly spread set a wave of destruction throughout the underground
[1:03:11.640 --> 1:03:17.200]  fueled by the media fear and panic spread quickly fracturing and dividing
[1:03:17.200 --> 1:03:22.400]  the country until at last the true goal comes into view before the st. Mary's
[1:03:22.400 --> 1:03:26.040]  crisis no one would have predicted the results of the election that year no
[1:03:26.040 --> 1:03:32.840]  one after the election low and behold America some believed it was the work
[1:03:32.840 --> 1:03:37.080]  of God himself but it was a pharmaceutical company controlled by
[1:03:37.080 --> 1:03:42.960]  certain party members that made them all obscenely rich a year later several
[1:03:42.960 --> 1:03:48.080]  extremists tried found guilty and executed while a memorial is built to
[1:03:48.080 --> 1:03:53.600]  canonize their victims but the end result the true genius of the plan was
[1:03:53.600 --> 1:03:58.520]  the fear fear became the ultimate tool of this government and through it our
[1:03:58.520 --> 1:04:02.800]  politician was ultimately appointed to the newly created position of the high
[1:04:02.800 --> 1:04:12.040]  chancellor the rest is they say history can you prove any of this why do you
[1:04:12.040 --> 1:04:18.880]  think I'm still alive all right we'd like to take you into protective

[1:06:23.960 --> 1:06:27.560]  we're taking your phone calls right now that at least the same clubs this is the
[1:06:27.560 --> 1:06:32.160]  talking point being put up by the White House press secretary saying that
[1:06:32.160 --> 1:06:37.080]  anybody that disagrees with whatever they say is an extremist a fascist that's
[1:06:37.080 --> 1:06:41.240]  what Biden just did was declare war on you can't get more authoritarian than
[1:06:41.240 --> 1:06:46.840]  that unless you had a red background with troops standing behind you oh they did
[1:06:46.840 --> 1:06:52.160]  that too but was it a nighttime ceremony oh that too yeah this is a direct
[1:06:52.160 --> 1:06:58.840]  playbook of over-the-top fascism here it is again we see majority of Americans
[1:06:58.840 --> 1:07:06.120]  who disagree and so when you are not with where majority of Americans are then
[1:07:06.120 --> 1:07:11.360]  you know that is extreme that is an extreme way of thinking I'm not gonna
[1:07:11.360 --> 1:07:17.720]  that's what I have for you Phil and Biden went on at least seven times have the
[1:07:17.720 --> 1:07:22.000]  clips right here played some last hour saying our opposition or terrorists
[1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:26.640]  they're fascists are planning a terror they're planning violence unbelievable
[1:07:26.640 --> 1:07:31.760]  let's race through your calls right now let's go to John in Vegas John thanks
[1:07:31.760 --> 1:07:37.560]  for calling go ahead yeah I'm looking at the Biden transcript right now and I
[1:07:37.560 --> 1:07:43.280]  don't see a single thing that you're talking about in this I tell you what
[1:07:43.280 --> 1:07:48.640]  what you're doing edging your audience constantly is embarrassing and a shame
[1:07:48.640 --> 1:07:52.320]  okay so you listen listen you're a seminar caller you said you were calling
[1:07:52.320 --> 1:07:57.080]  on the Air Force about the Biden speech I can play the clips right now while
[1:07:57.080 --> 1:08:01.040]  you're gaslighting even the Washington Post said it was basically a declaration
[1:08:01.040 --> 1:08:06.680]  of war there they're saying Republicans are planning violence everywhere are you
[1:08:06.680 --> 1:08:09.920]  denying he's up there with troops behind him that's unprecedented for a
[1:08:09.920 --> 1:08:13.560]  president to give a speech with troops at night time with red light behind him
[1:08:13.560 --> 1:08:19.480]  are you denying that I'm I'm denying that I've had enough I've had enough if you
[1:08:19.480 --> 1:08:22.560]  called in and said you disagree that legitimate points I talked to you I'm
[1:08:22.560 --> 1:08:26.080]  not gonna play your games I got stacks of articles them controlling our
[1:08:26.080 --> 1:08:30.200]  thermostats their child smuggling over the border they're saying Republicans are
[1:08:30.200 --> 1:08:34.280]  about the Hill I'm not even gonna humor you and play the clips everybody saw
[1:08:34.280 --> 1:08:39.480]  the speech last night everybody saw it all right let's go ahead take another
[1:08:39.480 --> 1:08:42.520]  call or we're moving fast here let's go ahead and talk to Joe and Delaware
[1:08:42.520 --> 1:08:47.360]  Joe says former Marine give us your take on this hey Alex how's it going man yeah
[1:08:47.360 --> 1:08:52.720]  what I think is I think whenever Trump gives a speech I think everybody in the
[1:08:52.720 --> 1:08:57.360]  country should take a loudspeaker and play it at top volume for the whole
[1:08:57.360 --> 1:09:01.520]  entire speech and let that echo throughout the whole country I agree if
[1:09:01.520 --> 1:09:05.280]  everybody got a bullhorn and hooked it up with with an iPad or whatever and went
[1:09:05.280 --> 1:09:10.560]  out and blared my show Trump anybody telling the truth that would
[1:09:10.560 --> 1:09:16.800]  really cause a big effect yeah and also I mean you know I appreciate you know a
[1:09:16.800 --> 1:09:21.920]  lot of people you know being going gone and having all these strategies and all
[1:09:21.920 --> 1:09:27.400]  that but people are gonna have to remember combat is a full-time full
[1:09:27.400 --> 1:09:34.400]  contact sport it's no joke it's the ultimate combat sport and you know I
[1:09:34.400 --> 1:09:40.280]  don't really think that you know most of America really has this measured up
[1:09:40.280 --> 1:09:44.360]  you know no the way it should be well I mean you heard the last caller say
[1:09:44.360 --> 1:09:47.880]  Biden wasn't saying Republicans are violent are gonna be violent they're
[1:09:47.880 --> 1:09:51.240]  all over the news saying Civil War are about to kill everybody he's I mean we
[1:09:51.240 --> 1:09:54.680]  can play the speech do you I mean did you watch the speech what do you make of
[1:09:54.680 --> 1:09:57.840]  that caller trying to gaslight us and saying he didn't say that me well
[1:09:57.840 --> 1:10:03.040]  obviously I mean people are in denial for different reasons but again I'd like
[1:10:03.040 --> 1:10:08.560]  to tell that caller don't forget buddy combats a full contact sport and if it
[1:10:08.560 --> 1:10:12.360]  sets off you're gonna be right in the middle of it and curling up like a
[1:10:12.360 --> 1:10:17.800]  like a like a little baby in the fetal position isn't gonna get you out of it
[1:10:17.800 --> 1:10:21.920]  so he better come up with something a little better than that man I mean that's
[1:10:21.920 --> 1:10:28.080]  just weakness I mean I called Joe Biden disco Joe to me he's just a disco boy
[1:10:28.080 --> 1:10:33.520]  from the past and he's being handed all this power by all these bits just a
[1:10:33.520 --> 1:10:38.160]  total disgrace Alex he is God bless you I appreciate your call let's go ahead and
[1:10:38.160 --> 1:10:42.720]  take another caller here let's go ahead and talk to Arthur in Texas Army go
[1:10:42.720 --> 1:10:47.680]  ahead give us your take on this yes Alex yes sir there's nothing in our
[1:10:47.680 --> 1:10:54.760]  Constitution that corresponds to article 48 of the Weimar Constitution which gave
[1:10:54.760 --> 1:11:02.840]  the president of that republic the power to suspend civil rights we have a
[1:11:02.840 --> 1:11:07.080]  provision to suspend habeas corpus but that's only one of our civil rights
[1:11:07.080 --> 1:11:12.600]  there's nothing in our Constitution that anyone can and know the bill of
[1:11:12.600 --> 1:11:17.520]  rights especially article 10 all powers not reserved the states are reserved
[1:11:17.520 --> 1:11:23.120]  the people right so well did you watch the Biden speech and what did you make
[1:11:23.120 --> 1:11:30.080]  of it I listened to it it's just it's unbelievable that a president of the
[1:11:30.080 --> 1:11:34.760]  United States could make a speech like that and direct it against half the
[1:11:34.760 --> 1:11:40.800]  country or well pretty much I mean a large part of the Republicans but what
[1:11:40.800 --> 1:11:43.840]  did you take away from it I mean I took away the Republicans are about to
[1:11:43.840 --> 1:11:46.880]  engage in violence with no evidence of that meaning they're about to stage
[1:11:46.880 --> 1:11:50.680]  something that's what I got from it well it's gaslighting it they do the exact
[1:11:50.680 --> 1:11:55.960]  they do the same thing they accuse you know the Republicans of doing all the
[1:11:55.960 --> 1:12:00.680]  of the left are the ones that have committed the horrible crimes against
[1:12:00.680 --> 1:12:08.280]  persons and property and police not the right it's just monster what he said
[1:12:08.280 --> 1:12:12.080]  over and over again the Republicans are being violent they're a republic I've
[1:12:12.080 --> 1:12:15.720]  got the quotes they're overthrowing it they're a danger they're planning more
[1:12:15.720 --> 1:12:19.960]  violence where it's not true and then the former FBI director deputy director
[1:12:19.960 --> 1:12:24.320]  comes out and says this wasn't strong enough targeting the insurrectionists
[1:12:24.320 --> 1:12:31.080]  yeah well I would advise them to read the Constitution if that if they're
[1:12:31.080 --> 1:12:36.600]  planning to do something like that now you go back to Weimar within within three
[1:12:36.600 --> 1:12:41.320]  months of the taking of power the presidential appointment of Hitler as
[1:12:41.320 --> 1:12:46.480]  Chancellor the police pretty much all the police except Prussia was put under
[1:12:46.480 --> 1:12:54.720]  Heinrich Himmler and a year later even the Gestapo created by Göring was put
[1:12:54.720 --> 1:13:01.080]  under Himmler so they had all of the police in Germany federal and everything
[1:13:01.080 --> 1:13:07.120]  else under one central authority and Reinhardt Galen and all the rest of them
[1:13:07.120 --> 1:13:15.280]  that's right and in our country policing is local and given to the states and so
[1:13:15.280 --> 1:13:20.120]  anything else is a usurpation of the police power answer how do you think we
[1:13:20.120 --> 1:13:23.280]  counter this because clearly they're saying we're gonna be violent with no
[1:13:23.280 --> 1:13:26.360]  evidence with Marines standing behind him in a nighttime ceremony with a red
[1:13:26.360 --> 1:13:30.600]  light extremely fascist iconography what do you think they're I think they're
[1:13:30.600 --> 1:13:34.840]  trying to go to us into something like a red cape in front of a bull well you
[1:13:34.840 --> 1:13:39.240]  know behind Hitler at all his speeches there were a couple SS guys standing
[1:13:39.240 --> 1:13:47.080]  there attention imagine if Trump gave a nighttime speech like yeah it's just
[1:13:47.080 --> 1:13:50.520]  unbelievable what these people could think they can get away with all right
[1:13:50.520 --> 1:13:56.040]  sir I appreciate your call speak of the devil here here's the former deputy
[1:13:56.040 --> 1:14:03.120]  director discredited dishonored disgraced Annie McCabe say he didn't go far
[1:14:03.120 --> 1:14:09.480]  enough here it is he made a direct plea to have violence out of politics there is
[1:14:09.480 --> 1:14:14.640]  no place for violence in politics he says he referenced the fact that you can't
[1:14:14.640 --> 1:14:19.880]  be an insurrectionist and before democracy for the people who are hit
[1:14:19.880 --> 1:14:23.440]  pause we're gonna play it again in a minute from the start nobody's calling
[1:14:23.440 --> 1:14:26.880]  for violence you're not an insurrectionist because you take the election
[1:14:26.880 --> 1:14:29.840]  was stolen again this is they're declaring we're the enemy and they got
[1:14:29.840 --> 1:14:32.840]  one of their people calling in the gas lightest and say it's not happening what
[1:14:32.840 --> 1:14:38.640]  play he made a direct plea to have violence out of politics there is no
[1:14:38.640 --> 1:14:43.840]  place for violence in politics he says he referenced the fact that you can't be
[1:14:43.840 --> 1:14:49.160]  an insurrectionist and before democracy for the people who are in law
[1:14:49.160 --> 1:14:52.400]  enforcement and to an extent you're caught in the middle of this is this
[1:14:52.400 --> 1:14:56.560]  something they want to hear no question no question people in law enforcement and
[1:14:56.560 --> 1:15:01.440]  people within I think government more broadly want to hear national political
[1:15:01.440 --> 1:15:05.640]  figures to include of course the president to come out and absolutely call
[1:15:05.640 --> 1:15:11.000]  out political violence everything from local school board officials to local
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:16.360]  election officials to our my own former colleagues at the FBI no place in our
[1:15:16.360 --> 1:15:21.400]  country right now they sense very personally and daily the rising tide of
[1:15:21.400 --> 1:15:26.200]  threats that they face and I think those things will be taken positively on the
[1:15:26.200 --> 1:15:29.920]  other hand I think people would like to have seen a bit more references to
[1:15:29.920 --> 1:15:34.720]  accountability there really wasn't much talk about what we're doing about those
[1:15:34.720 --> 1:15:37.760]  insurrectionists it was merely calling out the fact that nobody should support
[1:15:37.760 --> 1:15:41.440]  an insurrection so I think it's a positive moment for those folks in law
[1:15:41.440 --> 1:15:45.120]  enforcement and in government but but maybe would like to have seen more as
[1:15:45.120 --> 1:15:48.680]  well alright friends stand by okay so there's a rising tide of violence and
[1:15:48.680 --> 1:15:52.120]  we need to lock everybody up I mean you just said it but the liberals calling
[1:15:52.120 --> 1:15:56.920]  gaslight and say no no no no you're not under attack everything's fine
[1:15:57.640 --> 1:16:04.200]  just look at these headlines from Reuters world faces unprecedented global

[1:19:59.880 --> 1:20:06.760]  assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[1:20:14.360 --> 1:20:18.320]  the mass formations became stronger and stronger and stronger throughout the
[1:20:18.320 --> 1:20:21.960]  last few hundreds of years and that's interesting because it's because the man
[1:20:21.960 --> 1:20:27.240]  in the first half of the 20th century the masses became so strong that led by
[1:20:27.240 --> 1:20:32.200]  certain leaders they could cease control of the state apparatus and that's how
[1:20:32.200 --> 1:20:37.200]  totalitarian states emerge yes totalitarian states Hanna Arren says
[1:20:37.200 --> 1:20:43.200]  are always diabolic packed between the masses and their leaders it's a diabolic
[1:20:43.200 --> 1:20:46.320]  packed between the masses and their leaders and in this way like a completely
[1:20:46.320 --> 1:20:49.920]  new kind of state emerges which is completely different from a classical
[1:20:49.920 --> 1:20:54.520]  dictatorship in a classical dictatorship there is a small group of people a
[1:20:54.520 --> 1:20:58.040]  dictatorial regime who has such an aggressive potential that people are so
[1:20:58.040 --> 1:21:01.960]  scared of them that they can impose unilaterally their social contract to
[1:21:01.960 --> 1:21:06.240]  the to the society but the totalitarian state emerges in a completely
[1:21:06.240 --> 1:21:09.640]  different way in a totalitarian state there is first a process of mass
[1:21:09.640 --> 1:21:14.800]  formation which is a process through which a certain part of the population
[1:21:14.800 --> 1:21:20.200]  usually about 30% phonetically starts to believe in a certain ideology and this
[1:21:20.200 --> 1:21:24.880]  phenomenon can be created artificially through indoctrination propaganda and
[1:21:24.880 --> 1:21:28.760]  just pause you think that number can be as low as 30% yes usually it is not
[1:21:28.760 --> 1:21:30.880]  higher than 30%

[1:21:59.400 --> 1:22:05.320]  Rogan show as well you want to get right into Biden's speech professor and just
[1:22:05.320 --> 1:22:09.800]  how archetypal it is with at night time with troops behind him with red light
[1:22:09.800 --> 1:22:13.520]  and it's right out of V for Vendetta it's right out of Nazi Germany it's right
[1:22:13.520 --> 1:22:18.040]  out of Stalinist Russia it's right of North Korea and and saying our enemies
[1:22:18.040 --> 1:22:22.640]  are gonna be bad and we've got to have a war with them what did you make of that
[1:22:22.640 --> 1:22:29.640]  and and it's great to have you here with us yes well this speech definitely puts
[1:22:29.640 --> 1:22:34.240]  us at risk of something and it is that it entices the people who are targeted
[1:22:34.240 --> 1:22:39.280]  namely those people who are target to who are who are referred to by President
[1:22:39.280 --> 1:22:45.480]  Biden as a mega extremists that it entices these people to act upon their
[1:22:45.480 --> 1:22:51.800]  aggression and that's what should be avoided at all times because it will be
[1:22:51.800 --> 1:22:56.640]  counterproductive and self-destructive if people act upon their aggression because
[1:22:56.640 --> 1:23:00.880]  the system can perfectly control aggression I believe that it is of
[1:23:00.880 --> 1:23:08.280]  crucial importance that we stick to the principles of nonviolent resistance and
[1:23:08.280 --> 1:23:13.880]  that we realize that the first and foremost enemy you have to watch is that
[1:23:13.880 --> 1:23:18.080]  part of the enemy that is in ourselves namely this aggression that might
[1:23:18.080 --> 1:23:24.720]  entice us to act in a violent way that might entice us to believe that violent
[1:23:24.720 --> 1:23:29.120]  resistance is the solution to this problem and it won't be in several
[1:23:29.120 --> 1:23:33.360]  respects well I read your book almost a year ago online when you were on Joe
[1:23:33.360 --> 1:23:36.560]  Rogan thought it was excellent I'm not trained in psychology but I can just see
[1:23:36.560 --> 1:23:40.280]  the basic things obviously in function the books the bestseller the psychology
[1:23:40.280 --> 1:23:45.040]  of Italianism professor Desmond here in studio with us right now in Austin
[1:23:45.040 --> 1:23:51.600]  Texas on the September second broadcast I likened this to the Matador speech or
[1:23:51.600 --> 1:23:55.120]  the bullfight speech where they have the red cape the red light the nighttime the
[1:23:55.120 --> 1:23:58.840]  troops and we're coming for you we're gonna get you hoping the bull charges
[1:23:58.840 --> 1:24:01.600]  and they've got the sword ready
[1:24:01.600 --> 1:24:07.600]  hmm yes indeed that's a that's the impression that is raised by by the
[1:24:07.600 --> 1:24:13.800]  speech and that's what exactly what we should not react upon we should we
[1:24:13.800 --> 1:24:22.360]  should watch out and and and stay calm I believe it's a it's a grave mistake of
[1:24:22.360 --> 1:24:27.520]  president Biden to give a speech like that it he should lead by example as a
[1:24:27.520 --> 1:24:32.880]  as a as a political leader and that's exactly what he doesn't he fans the
[1:24:32.880 --> 1:24:39.520]  polarization society and probably because he knows that if people react in a
[1:24:39.520 --> 1:24:43.800]  violent way it will be a gift to the system because that is exactly what the
[1:24:43.800 --> 1:24:49.120]  system can perfectly control to give a nine-time speech with troops behind you
[1:24:49.120 --> 1:24:52.280]  with red light projected and then declare your your political opposition
[1:24:52.280 --> 1:24:56.280]  enemies I mean this is the thoroughbred to me to study history of
[1:24:56.280 --> 1:25:02.440]  authoritarianism hmm yes indeed indeed also in my interpretation of totalitarianism
[1:25:02.440 --> 1:25:06.360]  as I describe it in my book totalitarianism and I refer to I use the
[1:25:06.360 --> 1:25:11.440]  words of Hannah Arendt there totalitarianism is always a diabolic
[1:25:11.440 --> 1:25:17.520]  act between the masses and the elite and what what we've seen throughout the
[1:25:17.520 --> 1:25:21.040]  last decades and in particular in the corona crisis is that we've seen this
[1:25:21.040 --> 1:25:27.040]  part of the population which forms a new kind of group a mass in which is
[1:25:27.040 --> 1:25:31.000]  becomes more and more and more intolerant for dissonant voices in which
[1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:36.840]  tends to stigmatize these people who do not go along with the system to ex
[1:25:36.840 --> 1:25:43.800]  communicate them to push them outside of society and in the end to commit
[1:25:43.800 --> 1:25:47.440]  atrocities to them you're not in that final stage in that ultimate stage of
[1:25:47.440 --> 1:25:51.160]  the mass formation but we are at risk of getting to that stage and you coined the
[1:25:51.160 --> 1:26:00.200]  term mass formation or other similar terms but I see this mob rule mob
[1:26:00.200 --> 1:26:06.040]  psychology militant enthusiasm mass formation psychology what is that what
[1:26:06.040 --> 1:26:09.480]  is mass formation mass formation is actually a kind of group formation a
[1:26:09.480 --> 1:26:13.160]  specific kind of group formation that was the actual term I it's mass
[1:26:13.160 --> 1:26:18.760]  formation the actual term yeah mass formation the actual term some it's
[1:26:18.760 --> 1:26:21.720]  sometimes referred to as mass formation psychosis but they always avoid that
[1:26:21.720 --> 1:26:25.520]  term simply because I believe that it's better not to use a psychiatric term
[1:26:25.520 --> 1:26:30.120]  both from an intellectual a strategical and an ethical point but it's a it's a
[1:26:30.120 --> 1:26:35.960]  mass psychosis no it's for me it's a mass formation psychosis is it is a
[1:26:35.960 --> 1:26:41.760]  term that is borrowed from individual psychiatry and I refuse to use that
[1:26:41.760 --> 1:26:46.360]  term for group psychology but many people it shows similarities with a
[1:26:46.360 --> 1:26:51.600]  psychotic state simply because it makes people completely incapable of taking a
[1:26:51.600 --> 1:26:56.040]  critical distance of what the group believes in it makes that they are
[1:26:56.040 --> 1:27:01.400]  completely willing to radically self-sacrifice to sacrifice everything
[1:27:01.400 --> 1:27:05.080]  that used to be important for them before the group dynamic give up their
[1:27:05.080 --> 1:27:08.040]  energy give up their freedom give up their cars give up their children the
[1:27:08.040 --> 1:27:13.320]  health of the church yes stuff like that to give up everything and then the
[1:27:13.320 --> 1:27:17.800]  third characteristic as always what I just mentioned already that that mass
[1:27:17.800 --> 1:27:22.200]  formation makes people radically intolerant for dissonant voices and in
[1:27:22.200 --> 1:27:27.320]  the end will make that the masses start to destroy the people who do not go
[1:27:27.320 --> 1:27:31.560]  along with them as if it is their ethical duty to do so I will give a strong
[1:27:31.560 --> 1:27:37.200]  example in the revolution of 1979 in Iran which was a large-scale mass
[1:27:37.200 --> 1:27:43.520]  formation a woman I know has seen with her own eyes how a mother reported her
[1:27:43.520 --> 1:27:47.600]  son to the state and how she hung the rope around his neck when he was on
[1:27:47.600 --> 1:27:51.640]  the scaffold and how she claimed to be a heroine for what she did when he was
[1:27:51.640 --> 1:27:56.160]  hung that's the end stage the ultimate stage of mass formation that's what we
[1:27:56.160 --> 1:28:00.240]  should avoid that sounds like Stockholm syndrome that's similar to the Stockholm
[1:28:00.240 --> 1:28:04.400]  syndrome yes and I think that if you if you understand the mechanism of mass
[1:28:04.400 --> 1:28:08.120]  formation and that's why I thought it was so important to write my book if you
[1:28:08.120 --> 1:28:11.240]  understand the mechanism of mass formation you will understand what you
[1:28:11.240 --> 1:28:16.680]  have to do in order to prevent the masses to go to that ultimate stage where
[1:28:16.680 --> 1:28:20.960]  they will definitely destroy you this is what matters is to make the right
[1:28:20.960 --> 1:28:25.840]  strategical decision the right strategic decision when confronted with an
[1:28:25.840 --> 1:28:30.760]  emerging mass well I know this when you were on Joe Rogan a year and a half ago
[1:28:30.760 --> 1:28:33.880]  or whatever it was and then they got picked up all these other scientists they
[1:28:33.880 --> 1:28:37.520]  got really scared of what you said I mean they they are because obviously they're
[1:28:37.520 --> 1:28:42.080]  using it they're like oh they find this out it's over for us mm-hmm because they
[1:28:42.080 --> 1:28:45.080]  were different they are scared of the theory as they're scared of the theory
[1:28:45.080 --> 1:28:49.040]  because it explains I think it explains in detail all right well professor I'm
[1:28:49.040 --> 1:28:52.240]  gonna try to do this here with us for another hour I'm gonna try to just shut
[1:28:52.240 --> 1:28:55.600]  up and let you talk and explain all those two people because this is so

[1:32:18.320 --> 1:32:21.560]  tax groups because they're part of the system and they don't want the general

[1:32:57.960 --> 1:33:06.480]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones
[1:33:06.480 --> 1:33:15.800]  Dr. Matthias Desmond author of the psychology of
[1:33:15.800 --> 1:33:22.280]  psalterianism is our guest and it was Dr. Peter McCullough Joe Rogan from the
[1:33:22.280 --> 1:33:28.800]  front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones and what's funny how the
[1:33:28.800 --> 1:33:34.440]  planets aligned he was flying here today to be on the next hour but storm
[1:33:34.440 --> 1:33:38.600]  stopping me here you guys would have met but he'll actually be here tomorrow so
[1:33:38.600 --> 1:33:41.680]  you're still around you're welcome to come down here and be on with him but
[1:33:41.680 --> 1:33:47.760]  but what's important is you're exposing what I would call mob psychology or the
[1:33:47.760 --> 1:33:50.880]  insanity and you know crowds and how authoritarians team up with that to
[1:33:50.880 --> 1:33:54.840]  manipulate that that's my layman's terms for it and in clearly they're
[1:33:54.840 --> 1:33:58.920]  invoking that now with the White House Press Secretary and President Biden
[1:33:58.920 --> 1:34:04.200]  saying anybody disagrees with us as a fascist as a semi-fascist as an enemy so
[1:34:04.200 --> 1:34:08.160]  I can ask a lot of questions but just rolling through this the contemporary
[1:34:08.160 --> 1:34:13.560]  examples of this mind control these people are under and and how do we get
[1:34:13.560 --> 1:34:17.160]  them out of it and and and you keep speaking to how we protect ourselves
[1:34:17.160 --> 1:34:22.360]  from it indeed yes well I started to articulate this theory on mass
[1:34:22.360 --> 1:34:25.840]  formation during the corona crisis because I noticed in the beginning of
[1:34:25.840 --> 1:34:29.800]  the crisis I'm a clinical psychologist but I'm also a statistician I also a
[1:34:29.800 --> 1:34:33.400]  master in statistics and I started to study the statistics a little bit and
[1:34:33.400 --> 1:34:38.040]  I noticed immediately that the statistics dramatically overrated the
[1:34:38.040 --> 1:34:41.720]  dangerousness of the virus and at least that was my strong impression in the
[1:34:41.720 --> 1:34:45.040]  first weeks of the crisis and I immediately started to write opinion
[1:34:45.040 --> 1:34:48.760]  papers to warn the people that there was something dangerous out there and
[1:34:48.760 --> 1:34:54.920]  that I was not talking about a virus that I was talking about the fear for
[1:34:54.920 --> 1:35:00.360]  the virus the title of my first opinion paper was the fear of the virus is
[1:35:00.360 --> 1:35:05.880]  more dangerous than a virus itself and by the end of May 2020 according to me
[1:35:05.880 --> 1:35:10.800]  it was proven beyond the shape a shade of a doubt that indeed the initial
[1:35:10.800 --> 1:35:15.200]  models dramatically overrated the mortality rates of the virus for instance
[1:35:15.200 --> 1:35:19.840]  as for instance the models predicted that in Sweden 60,000 people would die if
[1:35:19.840 --> 1:35:24.800]  the country didn't go into lockdown by the end of May 2020 and Sweden didn't
[1:35:24.800 --> 1:35:30.560]  go into lockdown and only 6,000 people died and to arrive at that figure they
[1:35:30.560 --> 1:35:33.800]  had even to count in a very enthusiastic way or otherwise probably only
[1:35:33.800 --> 1:35:38.640]  thousand of 2,000 people would have died so at that moment I noticed two things
[1:35:38.640 --> 1:35:43.000]  it was clear that the mathematical models on which the corona measures were
[1:35:43.000 --> 1:35:47.800]  based were blatantly wrong and still the narrative continued and people
[1:35:47.800 --> 1:35:54.560]  continued to buy into it as if the models had been correct and I also
[1:35:54.560 --> 1:35:58.480]  noticed that no matter how much you tried to show people that the
[1:35:58.480 --> 1:36:05.160]  statistics were wrong it seemed as if they just didn't care and at that
[1:36:05.160 --> 1:36:08.680]  moment I decided to focus on something else I decided to focus on the
[1:36:08.680 --> 1:36:12.840]  psychological dynamics that were going on in society and in my opinion it
[1:36:12.840 --> 1:36:18.680]  started to dawn on me that what we were dealing with was a large-scale process
[1:36:18.680 --> 1:36:22.480]  of mass formation in society mass formation which is a specific group
[1:36:22.480 --> 1:36:28.240]  dynamic and as I said a few minutes ago a specific group dynamic which makes
[1:36:28.240 --> 1:36:33.120]  people radically incapable of taking a critical distance of what they
[1:36:33.120 --> 1:36:36.640]  believe in which makes people radically willing to self-sacrifice and which
[1:36:36.640 --> 1:36:41.600]  makes people radically intolerant for dissonant voices and this specific
[1:36:41.600 --> 1:36:48.440]  group dynamic this masses or this crowd exist as long as mankind has existed
[1:36:48.440 --> 1:36:52.960]  we have had crusades we've had witch hunts we've had the French Revolution the
[1:36:52.960 --> 1:36:57.120]  emergence of the large-scale masses of the Soviet Union the emergence of the
[1:36:57.120 --> 1:37:03.520]  large-scale masses of the of Nazi Germany so it has existed as long as
[1:37:03.520 --> 1:37:08.480]  mankind existed but and that's crucial it became stronger and stronger and
[1:37:08.480 --> 1:37:12.000]  stronger throughout the last few hundreds of centuries and that was as a
[1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:16.760]  consequence of the emergence of the so-called mechanist Russian list few
[1:37:16.760 --> 1:37:21.200]  men in the world which went together with excessive industrialization
[1:37:21.200 --> 1:37:25.760]  mechanization of the world and with the extreme use of technology after a while
[1:37:25.760 --> 1:37:29.400]  so it's a centralization allows this mind control the centralization allows
[1:37:29.400 --> 1:37:34.240]  a man mind control but also and more important in the first in the first
[1:37:34.240 --> 1:37:39.040]  place is that it puts people in a specific psychological condition what
[1:37:39.040 --> 1:37:43.400]  makes them vulnerable for indoctrination propaganda so does it make
[1:37:43.400 --> 1:37:47.800]  them suggestible or they just totally turn themselves over it makes them it in
[1:37:47.800 --> 1:37:53.600]  the first first step is always that this kind of mechanists view on man in the
[1:37:53.600 --> 1:37:57.800]  world this connects people from their social and the natural environment it
[1:37:57.800 --> 1:38:03.000]  makes them feel lonely and lock you in your house yes for it for instance but
[1:38:03.000 --> 1:38:06.480]  it has clearly done consciously then this is all yeah it happens both
[1:38:06.480 --> 1:38:10.360]  unconsciously unconsciously I mean those programming that are conscious of it the
[1:38:10.360 --> 1:38:14.800]  program is conscious but it also like this this this you can see that throughout
[1:38:14.800 --> 1:38:18.040]  the last few hundred of century centuries the number of people that felt
[1:38:18.040 --> 1:38:21.120]  lonely started to increase and increase and increase and just before the
[1:38:21.120 --> 1:38:27.000]  corona crisis it reached a peak over 40% of the population worldwide claimed to
[1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:31.240]  feel disconnected claimed reported to have no meaningful relationships at all
[1:38:31.240 --> 1:38:34.760]  but don't worry now the metaverse is here so right as this comes in the
[1:38:34.760 --> 1:38:38.400]  metaverse is rolled out yes yes yes that's what I describe in my third
[1:38:38.400 --> 1:38:44.720]  chapter that technological connection is not at all the same as a real connection
[1:38:44.720 --> 1:38:47.640]  and in personal connection completely different from a psychological point of
[1:38:47.640 --> 1:38:52.080]  view it's exactly this use of technology which really disconnects people which
[1:38:52.080 --> 1:38:55.960]  makes that their bodies do not resonate with each other anymore which makes them
[1:38:55.960 --> 1:39:00.360]  completely disconnected from each other except at the level of the exchange of
[1:39:00.360 --> 1:39:04.440]  information which is important but which is not the same it's this disconnected
[1:39:04.440 --> 1:39:09.520]  state that makes them vulnerable for mass formation because there's this
[1:39:09.520 --> 1:39:15.360]  connection in the first instance leads to lack of meaning-making people or
[1:39:15.360 --> 1:39:18.680]  confront start to be confronted with experiences of lack of meaning-making in
[1:39:18.680 --> 1:39:24.480]  life and then in the third step it makes them experience so-called free
[1:39:24.480 --> 1:39:29.880]  floating frustration and great anxiety and free floating anxiety frustration
[1:39:29.880 --> 1:39:34.720]  and aggression meaning a kind of anxiety frustration and aggression through
[1:39:34.720 --> 1:39:37.600]  well I'm sure you saw the folks that took some of what you said and made it into
[1:39:37.600 --> 1:39:42.240]  a cartoon graphic we probably play that yes and I think it's called like after
[1:39:42.240 --> 1:39:46.800]  school or you guys put on the screen yes continue and eat and eat it's this
[1:39:46.800 --> 1:39:50.440]  this this this this specific kind of anxiety frustration and aggression is a
[1:39:50.440 --> 1:39:53.720]  kind of anxiety frustration and aggression through which people in which
[1:39:53.720 --> 1:39:58.240]  people don't know what they feel anxious frustrated and aggressive for which is
[1:39:58.240 --> 1:40:02.920]  an extremely aversive mental state if you feel anxious and you don't know what
[1:40:02.920 --> 1:40:06.760]  you feel anxious for you feel completely out of control if you feel
[1:40:06.760 --> 1:40:10.120]  frustrated and aggressive without knowing what you feel frustrated and
[1:40:10.120 --> 1:40:14.520]  aggressive for you cannot take your aggression out to something it piles up
[1:40:14.520 --> 1:40:19.320]  in yourself and you feel this inner very aversive psychological tension and
[1:40:19.320 --> 1:40:25.240]  that's the state once a population is in that state they are extremely vulnerable
[1:40:25.240 --> 1:40:31.160]  for propaganda if under these conditions a narrative is distributed through the
[1:40:31.160 --> 1:40:36.800]  mass media time and time again indicating an object of anxiety and at the
[1:40:36.800 --> 1:40:41.360]  same time providing a strategy to deal with that object of anxiety then there
[1:40:41.360 --> 1:40:46.280]  is a good chance that all this free floating anxiety might connect to the
[1:40:46.280 --> 1:40:51.360]  object of anxiety and that there is a huge willingness to participate in the
[1:40:51.360 --> 1:40:55.800]  strategy to deal with the object of anxiety meaning that for instance the
[1:40:55.800 --> 1:41:00.960]  lockdowns will be accepted as a remedy for the virus or the
[1:41:00.960 --> 1:41:04.160]  concentration camps as remedy for the Jews or the witch hunts as remedy for
[1:41:04.160 --> 1:41:08.680]  the witches so that's the basic mechanism and this that's the first step of
[1:41:08.680 --> 1:41:14.320]  mass formation and in this way people take this first step simply because in
[1:41:14.320 --> 1:41:18.800]  this way they feel in control of their anxiety again and because they know they
[1:41:18.800 --> 1:41:23.760]  have the perspective of taking out all this pile the frustration aggression out
[1:41:23.760 --> 1:41:29.960]  on a common scapegoat someone or something that is considered the enemy in
[1:41:29.960 --> 1:41:36.000]  the narrative that sounds like a Gillian dialectic I don't know that problem
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:40.000]  reaction solution oh yes yes yes indeed yes yes but it's a symptomatic solution
[1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:42.760]  because and that's so important the second step of the mass formation is
[1:41:42.760 --> 1:41:48.200]  always the following because so many people at the same time participate in
[1:41:48.200 --> 1:41:52.480]  the strategy to deal with the object of anxiety they have the feeling of fighting
[1:41:52.480 --> 1:41:57.200]  a collective heroic battle with the object of anxiety and in that way it
[1:41:57.200 --> 1:42:02.040]  seems as if the root cause of the mass formation namely the loneliness and
[1:42:02.040 --> 1:42:06.440]  disconnectedness is solved people feel connected again yeah they make them
[1:42:06.440 --> 1:42:10.680]  alone and they create a crowd and they unify them by submitting and then they
[1:42:10.680 --> 1:42:15.280]  feel high off of it as usually well it's important to distinguish between two
[1:42:15.280 --> 1:42:20.080]  things usually before the emergence of a totalitarian system with indoctrination
[1:42:20.080 --> 1:42:25.080]  propaganda there is a prolonged phase in which people and which people just start
[1:42:25.080 --> 1:42:28.480]  to feel lonely because the way in which they live usually that first phase is
[1:42:28.480 --> 1:42:34.400]  unintentional usually and then as soon as the totalitarian system starts to use
[1:42:34.400 --> 1:42:38.840]  the propaganda and indoctrination it will actively start to isolate people
[1:42:38.840 --> 1:42:42.360]  because it knows that in that way they will become even more vulnerable and
[1:42:42.360 --> 1:42:45.800]  that's the mission to isolate us and do it and not let us go to church with family
[1:42:45.800 --> 1:42:49.120]  incredible professor when we come back continually whatever you want to hit

[1:47:25.320 --> 1:47:36.040]  how they're mind-controlling us and how to break free of it how to be aware of it
[1:47:36.040 --> 1:47:39.600]  how to help people that are locked into this because they get such a satisfied
[1:47:39.600 --> 1:47:44.680]  look taking the shots don't protect them wearing the mask believing the lies I
[1:47:44.680 --> 1:47:48.480]  see I see it all over Twitter and Facebook I've had four shots I'm super
[1:47:48.480 --> 1:47:53.400]  sick I love science I'm taking more they have really done a job on these people
[1:47:53.400 --> 1:47:57.320]  we're faster please continue yes well I had just been explaining that the first
[1:47:57.320 --> 1:48:01.720]  step is this process in which all this anxiety is attached to the object of
[1:48:01.720 --> 1:48:05.000]  anxiety indicated in the narrative and then people start to go along with the
[1:48:05.000 --> 1:48:08.280]  strategy to deal with that object of anxiety and to take out their aggression
[1:48:08.280 --> 1:48:12.480]  on this object of anxiety and then a second step happens which is even more
[1:48:12.480 --> 1:48:17.560]  important because so many people at the same time participate in a strategy to
[1:48:17.560 --> 1:48:21.240]  deal with the object of anxiety they have the feeling to fight a collective
[1:48:21.240 --> 1:48:26.040]  heroic battle with the object of anxiety and in this way they feel connected
[1:48:26.040 --> 1:48:31.120]  again you could say well what's the problem people felt lonely now they feel
[1:48:31.120 --> 1:48:36.600]  connected again they show solidarity again yes there is a problem just because
[1:48:36.600 --> 1:48:41.880]  a mass or a crowd is a group that is formed not because individuals connect
[1:48:41.880 --> 1:48:46.480]  to each other but because each other separately connects to the collective
[1:48:46.480 --> 1:48:51.800]  meaning that the famous solidarity the famous citizenship that emerges in a
[1:48:51.800 --> 1:48:56.200]  mass is never a solidarity between individuals it's a solidarity between
[1:48:56.200 --> 1:49:00.400]  the individual and the collective and that explains of course why for instance
[1:49:00.400 --> 1:49:04.720]  during the corona crisis people were all talking about solidarity and at the same
[1:49:04.720 --> 1:49:08.760]  time they accepted that if someone got an accident on the street they were not
[1:49:08.760 --> 1:49:13.000]  allowed to help that person or if their father and mother were dying in a
[1:49:13.000 --> 1:49:18.360]  nursing home that they were not allowed to visit them they just want of everyone
[1:49:18.360 --> 1:49:22.000]  the demand of everyone else that he sacrifices everything for the
[1:49:22.000 --> 1:49:26.920]  collective that is the reason why when a mass formation exists for a long time
[1:49:26.920 --> 1:49:31.840]  in the end all the solidarity is sucked away between the individuals and
[1:49:31.840 --> 1:49:36.840]  invested in the solidarity with the collective meaning that in the end even
[1:49:36.840 --> 1:49:43.480]  a mother doesn't show solidarity anymore for her child and she and that she is
[1:49:43.480 --> 1:49:47.640]  willing in the end to report her child to the state and to let it be sentenced
[1:49:47.640 --> 1:49:51.680]  to death that's the basic mechanism of mass formation which leads to an
[1:49:51.680 --> 1:49:55.720]  extreme control in the state apparatus that means the state and the corporate
[1:49:55.720 --> 1:50:01.720]  media can program the mass psychology the people then bow to that and now they're
[1:50:01.720 --> 1:50:06.680]  total slaves doesn't matter what's true what's not how do you how do you break
[1:50:06.680 --> 1:50:10.280]  people out of that now that's that's that's that's the most important thing
[1:50:10.280 --> 1:50:14.240]  how can you how what can we do about it and you know the first thing we have to
[1:50:14.240 --> 1:50:19.360]  realize is that a mass formation is technically speaking identical to a
[1:50:19.360 --> 1:50:25.560]  group hypnosis so meaning that the masses start to get in the grip of a voice a
[1:50:25.560 --> 1:50:29.680]  voice of a leader a voice that articulates time and time again the end
[1:50:29.680 --> 1:50:34.000]  indoctrination propaganda the the narrative that leads to the to the
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:39.760]  mass formation in the media and in a hypnotic state in hypnotic procedure
[1:50:39.760 --> 1:50:43.520]  exactly the same happens but that is at an individual level there is someone a
[1:50:43.520 --> 1:50:48.080]  hypnotist who draws away the attention of the of the environment of someone
[1:50:48.080 --> 1:50:53.640]  else who focuses all the attention on one small aspect of reality for instance
[1:50:53.640 --> 1:50:58.440]  an object that is moving on a chain and after a while you see that the person
[1:50:58.440 --> 1:51:03.600]  seems no longer to be aware of the rest of reality and this mechanism is so
[1:51:03.600 --> 1:51:07.680]  incredibly strong I've seen it with my own eyes it happens all the time for
[1:51:07.680 --> 1:51:12.600]  instance in a university hospital in Belgium how a simple hypnotic procedure
[1:51:12.600 --> 1:51:18.520]  is sufficient to focus the attention of a patient so much on one point one small
[1:51:18.520 --> 1:51:24.120]  aspect of reality that the person won't be aware anymore that there is a surgeon
[1:51:24.120 --> 1:51:28.960]  who cuts through the skin through the flesh flesh even straight through the
[1:51:28.960 --> 1:51:32.240]  breastbone to perform an open heart operation that's the reason why in a
[1:51:32.240 --> 1:51:36.360]  mass formation when all the attention is focused on one aspect of reality for
[1:51:36.360 --> 1:51:40.520]  instance a corona crisis the corona virus people are not aware anymore you're
[1:51:40.520 --> 1:51:44.040]  saying you've seen people hypnotized they can have open heart surgery with no
[1:51:44.040 --> 1:51:48.720]  anesthesia yeah absolutely unbelievable and and so why are some people more
[1:51:48.720 --> 1:51:53.040]  susceptible than others and as you said modern technology TV the internet
[1:51:53.040 --> 1:51:57.200]  allows people to be more susceptible yes for several reasons for several reasons
[1:51:57.200 --> 1:52:02.520]  you know there is one extremely important difference between the masses of
[1:52:02.520 --> 1:52:06.880]  ancient times and the masses of modern times the masses of ancient times met
[1:52:06.880 --> 1:52:12.040]  physically they were groups that met each other in person physically the
[1:52:12.040 --> 1:52:18.360]  modern masses are usually so-called lonely masses that means that the mass
[1:52:18.360 --> 1:52:22.840]  exists of individuals who are all isolated at their homes or are all
[1:52:22.840 --> 1:52:27.400]  separated from each other but who are all in the grip of the same narratives
[1:52:27.400 --> 1:52:31.600]  images words that are time and time distributed through the mass media and
[1:52:31.600 --> 1:52:37.280]  that connect them mentally and that state of a lonely mass is the perfect
[1:52:37.280 --> 1:52:41.000]  state for indoctrination and propaganda so before it's a human power when you're
[1:52:41.000 --> 1:52:44.400]  under attack to be able to unify but before there was an internet TV we were
[1:52:44.400 --> 1:52:47.480]  all experiencing an enemy attacking us the leader gets up and says let's
[1:52:47.480 --> 1:52:50.920]  mobilize to defend ourselves or let's you know there's no food here let's move
[1:52:50.920 --> 1:52:53.760]  over the mountain to the next thing everybody kind of sees it agrees with
[1:52:53.760 --> 1:52:58.240]  that instead they can put in fake data or fake information and then create that
[1:52:58.240 --> 1:53:02.320]  mass formation and then literally control people now something like that
[1:53:02.320 --> 1:53:07.440]  yes the mass formation always and on the one hand emerges in a more or less
[1:53:07.440 --> 1:53:11.680]  spontaneous way and on the other hand what happens is that if an elite or if
[1:53:11.680 --> 1:53:15.960]  if someone who gets control over the mass media can
[1:53:15.960 --> 1:53:21.320]  re-disseminate the same narratives time and time again he will be able to steer
[1:53:21.320 --> 1:53:25.640]  the masses so is there any doubt I talk about the controllers themselves because
[1:53:25.640 --> 1:53:29.600]  obviously that operation lockstep they all these programs saying we'll use
[1:53:29.600 --> 1:53:33.600]  viruses to bring global control we'll use the fear to do it how do you think
[1:53:33.600 --> 1:53:39.560]  this program went for them and what is it what is it they're planning next I
[1:53:39.560 --> 1:53:44.680]  think in the end that's it's like they there is since the the beginning of the
[1:53:44.680 --> 1:53:49.240]  17th century actually actually we've seen the emergence of this of this new
[1:53:49.240 --> 1:53:53.360]  ideology this ideology which believes that the entire universe can and can be
[1:53:53.360 --> 1:53:56.320]  understood in a rational way and which believes that rational control and
[1:53:56.320 --> 1:54:02.920]  manipulation of of life and of society and of the human being in the end is
[1:54:02.920 --> 1:54:08.400]  necessary and and and will lead to a kind of new utopian paradise that has
[1:54:08.400 --> 1:54:12.320]  been the dream of all totalitarian governments so and it's that ideology
[1:54:12.320 --> 1:54:17.720]  which on the one hand puts puts the population in this state where they
[1:54:17.720 --> 1:54:21.200]  became very vulnerable for mass formation and on the other hand slowly
[1:54:21.200 --> 1:54:25.840]  created an elite which believed that it should manipulate society through
[1:54:25.840 --> 1:54:29.280]  indoctrination propaganda if you read the seminal works of people such as
[1:54:29.280 --> 1:54:34.760]  trotman a trot or lipman a bernice then you see that these guys really say it
[1:54:34.760 --> 1:54:39.520]  out loud the politicians cannot control society anymore population
[1:54:39.520 --> 1:54:43.600]  politicians cannot control the population anymore because politicians are
[1:54:43.600 --> 1:54:47.480]  not really leaders they are followers because they have to be elected this
[1:54:47.480 --> 1:54:51.440]  means that that's with the WFS they say we need a scientific elite to direct
[1:54:51.440 --> 1:54:56.200]  humanity yes experts experts who use indoctrination propaganda to control
[1:54:56.200 --> 1:55:00.480]  society that's what they say clearly even from the beginning of the 19th
[1:55:00.480 --> 1:55:04.840]  century onwards very clearly if we want to control the process of trying to get
[1:55:04.840 --> 1:55:08.000]  the public to conform to acting like programmable robots
[1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:11.680]  something like that yes something like that how do you counter yes that's the
[1:55:11.680 --> 1:55:16.240]  point so that's that's what is important so as soon as you understand that the
[1:55:16.240 --> 1:55:20.200]  mechanism of mass formation is identical to hypnosis then you also understand
[1:55:20.200 --> 1:55:25.560]  that mass formation in the end boils down to a population that is in the grip
[1:55:25.560 --> 1:55:31.880]  of a voice and if the only voice that speaks out is the voice of the leaders
[1:55:31.880 --> 1:55:35.280]  of the masses then the masses will become more and more fanatically convinced
[1:55:35.280 --> 1:55:38.280]  that they have to this and that's why they've got a censor and share everybody
[1:55:38.280 --> 1:55:42.000]  else down they're gonna be one voice yes of course of course that's the first
[1:55:42.000 --> 1:55:45.880]  the answer is more free voices yes that is the first rule of all propaganda make
[1:55:45.880 --> 1:55:49.920]  sure that you're the only one who speaks out so and then once you understand
[1:55:49.920 --> 1:55:54.000]  that is it's it's clear what you have to do you have to the dissonant voices have
[1:55:54.000 --> 1:55:57.400]  to make sure that they continue to speak out and that was exactly what went wrong
[1:55:57.400 --> 1:56:02.360]  in Nazi Germany and in the Soviet Union at a certain moment your position decided
[1:56:02.360 --> 1:56:07.600]  that it became too dangerous to speak out they reacted as if they were dealing
[1:56:07.600 --> 1:56:11.840]  with a classical dictatorship a classical dictatorship in which there is no
[1:56:11.840 --> 1:56:15.120]  mass formation that's a difference with a totalitarian state classical
[1:56:15.120 --> 1:56:20.080]  dictatorship is simply based on the fact that the population is scared of a
[1:56:20.080 --> 1:56:24.120]  small group whom they consider to be very aggressive to have a huge aggressive
[1:56:24.120 --> 1:56:28.480]  potential and hence the population accepts that this small group imposes
[1:56:28.480 --> 1:56:32.680]  unilaterally at social contract to the population and totalitarian state is
[1:56:32.680 --> 1:56:36.160]  based on a completely different psychological mechanism it's based on
[1:56:36.160 --> 1:56:41.080]  the mechanism of mass formation of this mass hypnosis meaning that if the
[1:56:41.080 --> 1:56:44.920]  resistance when it is confronted with the emergence of a totalitarian state
[1:56:44.920 --> 1:56:51.880]  choose it to speak out it chooses to die it will be destroyed because the
[1:56:51.880 --> 1:56:55.480]  hypnosis will get deeper and deeper and it will arrive at that ultimate stage
[1:56:55.480 --> 1:56:59.760]  where the masses become radically convinced that everyone who doesn't go
[1:56:59.760 --> 1:57:05.320]  along with them is inhumane lacks all solidarity and citizenships and hence
[1:57:05.320 --> 1:57:11.000]  deserves to be destroyed so that's the point in 1930 the Soviet the resistance
[1:57:11.000 --> 1:57:16.880]  chose to stop to speak out speaking out in the Soviet Union in 1935 it stopped
[1:57:16.880 --> 1:57:21.880]  to speak out in Nazi Germany and within a period of six months the destruction
[1:57:21.880 --> 1:57:25.760]  campaign started there was enough support in a population to start a destruction
[1:57:25.760 --> 1:57:30.480]  campaigns so when you understand that you understand that no matter what
[1:57:30.480 --> 1:57:35.040]  happens the people who do or not in the grip of the mass formation have to
[1:57:35.040 --> 1:57:39.720]  continue to speak out and the important thing is they should realize that they
[1:57:39.720 --> 1:57:43.280]  will not wake up the masses that's crucial oh this is fascinating we'll
[1:57:43.280 --> 1:57:49.640]  come right back professor amazing stay with us just look at these headlines

[2:00:09.080 --> 2:00:12.960]  Matias Desmond is an amazing individual very smart the psychology of
[2:00:12.960 --> 2:00:15.840]  Salterianism is the book everybody should read it I know I read it about a
[2:00:15.840 --> 2:00:19.800]  year ago there appeared McCullough was talking about on Joe Rogan and the
[2:00:19.800 --> 2:00:23.400]  establishment got really pissed and upset about it but it's dead on just for my
[2:00:23.400 --> 2:00:26.520]  lay research how they operate some stations don't care this first five we
[2:00:26.520 --> 2:00:29.600]  were this other 30 minutes but but you were getting into solutions and I asked
[2:00:29.600 --> 2:00:33.760]  you in the break will the globalists succeed I mean to me this seems like a
[2:00:33.760 --> 2:00:36.600]  very black magic type thing they're doing you said absolutely not they're
[2:00:36.600 --> 2:00:39.920]  gonna destroy them said we'll get to that next segment right now we're getting
[2:00:39.920 --> 2:00:43.520]  into solutions and how do you get somebody who is irrational under this
[2:00:43.520 --> 2:00:49.280]  programming out of it why are some of us less susceptible than others okay that's
[2:00:49.280 --> 2:00:53.800]  indeed the most crucial aspect of my book I think what can you do about it and
[2:00:53.800 --> 2:00:59.720]  this is something very important from the 19th century onwards such scholars as
[2:00:59.720 --> 2:01:03.640]  Gustave Le Bon who studied the psychology of the masses have remarked that if a
[2:01:03.640 --> 2:01:08.080]  large mass emerges in a society there is always a group who is not in the grip of
[2:01:08.080 --> 2:01:13.240]  it and this group typically wants to wake up the people in the masses they try to
[2:01:13.240 --> 2:01:17.240]  show them they are baffled and they try to show them how absurd the beliefs or
[2:01:17.240 --> 2:01:22.200]  that the group that live in the group and this group tries to wake the masses
[2:01:22.200 --> 2:01:26.680]  up and it doesn't succeed this group usually won't succeed in waking up the
[2:01:26.680 --> 2:01:32.480]  masses that's almost impossible but and that's crucial Gustave Le Bon mentioned
[2:01:32.480 --> 2:01:39.000]  already in his famous work the psychology of the crowd published in 1895 he
[2:01:39.000 --> 2:01:44.240]  said it's not because this dissonant group this dissonant group doesn't succeed
[2:01:44.240 --> 2:01:50.240]  in waking up the masses that its speech has no effect to the contrary its speech
[2:01:50.240 --> 2:01:54.960]  has a crucial effect the speech of the dissonant of the of the dissidents
[2:01:54.960 --> 2:02:00.960]  constantly disturbs the mass formation it and it makes that it doesn't go so
[2:02:00.960 --> 2:02:06.880]  deep that the masses start arrive at the final stage where they start to commit
[2:02:06.880 --> 2:02:13.360]  atrocities so and then that's I will repeat something here so you upset their
[2:02:13.360 --> 2:02:19.080]  delusion and they kill you yes they they get mad when you expose it no well it
[2:02:19.080 --> 2:02:23.520]  depends it depends it depends no if you if you if you speak out in a in a quiet
[2:02:23.520 --> 2:02:29.920]  way and if you don't really try to convince them but just live up to your
[2:02:29.920 --> 2:02:33.600]  ethical duty of articulating your own opinion then you will see that you
[2:02:33.600 --> 2:02:37.440]  disturb the mass formation that it doesn't go deeper and deeper and something
[2:02:37.440 --> 2:02:41.080]  crucial happens then so the way you do it is you just go oh look at this or what
[2:02:41.080 --> 2:02:44.880]  do you think of this yes yes you look that's your opinion that's mine and you
[2:02:44.880 --> 2:02:48.760]  can take it or leave it it doesn't matter but I will time and time again
[2:02:48.760 --> 2:02:53.040]  articulate my own opinion and in that way the mass formation is constantly
[2:02:53.040 --> 2:02:57.400]  disturbed and then something crucial happens the masses are always self
[2:02:57.400 --> 2:03:01.560]  destructive that means if they continue to exist they will slowly exhaust
[2:03:01.560 --> 2:03:07.960]  themselves their power will decrease slowly and the power of the group who
[2:03:07.960 --> 2:03:12.360]  doesn't go along with the masses and who continues to live up to this these
[2:03:12.360 --> 2:03:17.480]  ethical principles of of speaking out will slowly increase its mental path
[2:03:17.480 --> 2:03:21.840]  they ascend yes they ascend and at a certain moment the two lines cross each
[2:03:21.840 --> 2:03:26.960]  other and the small group has a stronger psychological effect than the masses
[2:03:26.960 --> 2:03:32.320]  itself because have we crossed that line yet I think we I think that there are
[2:03:32.320 --> 2:03:37.880]  more people waking up these days but at the same time the system itself will
[2:03:37.880 --> 2:03:41.280]  increase the repression I think it will increase the repression so it will get
[2:03:41.280 --> 2:03:45.400]  more difficult I think in the in the years to come and what we always have
[2:03:45.400 --> 2:03:51.240]  to keep in mind what we always have to focus on is simply no matter what
[2:03:51.240 --> 2:03:56.120]  happens continue to speak out even if they kick us off the internet then we
[2:03:56.120 --> 2:04:00.280]  will have to speak out in a different way but we will continue to speak out
[2:04:00.280 --> 2:04:04.920]  no matter what happens and we shouldn't make one crucial mistake that has been
[2:04:04.920 --> 2:04:10.200]  described by Hannah Arendt by a so many people who observed mass formation and
[2:04:10.200 --> 2:04:15.440]  totalitarianism in the resistance resistance against a totalitarian system
[2:04:15.440 --> 2:04:21.240]  from within should always stick to the principles of nonviolent resistance
[2:04:21.240 --> 2:04:27.520]  always simply because each violence will be used as a pretext will be used as a
[2:04:27.520 --> 2:04:33.040]  justification will be used to create a support in the masses to destroy the
[2:04:33.040 --> 2:04:36.680]  dissonant voices and it was Jesus and then Gandhi and the Martin Luther King
[2:04:36.680 --> 2:04:40.160]  Junior understood that they understood that and they they they're Gandhi
[2:04:40.160 --> 2:04:44.080]  succeeded in kicking out the English from India in a nonviolent resistance way
[2:04:44.080 --> 2:04:48.400]  and that's so typical since the emergence of imperialism and totalitarianism
[2:04:48.400 --> 2:04:52.720]  nonviolent resistance has been the most efficient let's talk about that a second
[2:04:52.720 --> 2:04:59.040]  down professor this is absolutely amazing powerful ledger here ultimate fish

[2:06:16.440 --> 2:06:21.440]  so we saw that incredible declaration of war against any political opposition
[2:06:21.440 --> 2:06:24.920]  last night with a red background with troops and attention behind the leader
[2:06:24.920 --> 2:06:30.800]  I mean that's North Korea iconography the psychology totalitarianism professor
[2:06:30.800 --> 2:06:35.640]  Desmond's here whether snuck it out of the park sir please continue with where
[2:06:35.640 --> 2:06:38.720]  this goes historically how we counter it and you were telling me during the
[2:06:38.720 --> 2:06:42.440]  breaks you're saying no this will destroy the the establishment using this
[2:06:42.440 --> 2:06:47.240]  power as well so they're definitely scared of your research keep laying it up
[2:06:47.240 --> 2:06:54.640]  hmm yes well I think that it's always good to realize that when it comes to
[2:06:54.640 --> 2:06:57.800]  so we have on the one hand is this indeed is diabolic packed between the
[2:06:57.800 --> 2:07:01.600]  masses in the elite the masses will exhaust themselves but also the elite
[2:07:01.600 --> 2:07:05.200]  will kill itself but will exhaust itself simply because and that's that's
[2:07:05.200 --> 2:07:09.640]  something that is very hard to understand but I think it's crucial also the elite
[2:07:09.640 --> 2:07:14.400]  the elite which leads the masses is hypnotized it's also hypnotized by
[2:07:14.400 --> 2:07:17.200]  itself that's something that was very well described smoke on their own dough
[2:07:17.200 --> 2:07:24.600]  yes yes absolutely but this is just a crucial nuance they are hypnotized by
[2:07:24.600 --> 2:07:28.640]  their ideology that means they phonetically believe in their own
[2:07:28.640 --> 2:07:32.800]  ideal by their own weird conformity like like radical Islam yes in this case
[2:07:32.800 --> 2:07:36.240]  that is transhumanism and technocracy the technocratic ideology which is
[2:07:36.240 --> 2:07:39.760]  actually a contemporary variant of the mechanism ideology so they believe
[2:07:39.760 --> 2:07:44.880]  blindly explain that spend time on that I mean the religion of you've all Harari
[2:07:44.880 --> 2:07:49.560]  of Klaus Schwab why they'd be so open you'll have no freedom we're taking over
[2:07:49.560 --> 2:07:52.600]  your body but there you can see they're true believers they're high as a kite
[2:07:52.600 --> 2:07:57.560]  they are they are in in hypnotized yes of course they they completely believe
[2:07:57.560 --> 2:08:00.680]  in it and and that's something that I also describe in my book the reason is
[2:08:00.680 --> 2:08:05.840]  simply like this transhumanist ideology is a contemporary variant of the old
[2:08:05.840 --> 2:08:10.640]  mechanist ideology which which believes that the entire universe is a kind of a
[2:08:10.640 --> 2:08:15.000]  set of elementary particles atoms molecules that all interact according to
[2:08:15.000 --> 2:08:19.200]  the laws of mechanics and that can be perfectly described in a rationalist way
[2:08:19.200 --> 2:08:23.720]  technocracy technocracy that's the basis of technocracy as soon as you believe
[2:08:23.720 --> 2:08:28.120]  that the universe can be perfectly described in a rational way then the
[2:08:28.120 --> 2:08:32.560]  inevitable ultimate conclusion is that society should not be led by
[2:08:32.560 --> 2:08:36.840]  democratically it's gotta be a war on free will yes yes yes yes definitely and
[2:08:36.840 --> 2:08:41.760]  and so that's the inevitable conclusion we need experts who lead society
[2:08:41.760 --> 2:08:46.400]  strangely enough these experts claim to represent science but that's not at all
[2:08:46.400 --> 2:08:50.600]  the case science concluded exactly the opposite all seminal scientists
[2:08:50.600 --> 2:08:55.880]  concluded that reality in the end is irrational that's so strange they all
[2:08:55.880 --> 2:09:00.320]  all seminal scientists concluded that our rational understanding has a very
[2:09:00.320 --> 2:09:05.760]  limited grip on reality well I mean like Einstein said I mean I mean the whole
[2:09:05.760 --> 2:09:09.560]  nation the universe is that there's this randomness to it imagination is more
[2:09:09.560 --> 2:09:13.680]  important than knowledge Einstein said and Niels Bohr for instance the famous
[2:09:13.680 --> 2:09:17.600]  Nobel Prize-winning physicist said when it comes to atoms to elementary
[2:09:17.600 --> 2:09:22.320]  particles language can only be used as poetry and he was dead serious when he
[2:09:22.320 --> 2:09:25.920]  said well what about the observation principle where these particles won't
[2:09:25.920 --> 2:09:30.120]  move when they're being watched this is I mean this is yes yes yes these these
[2:09:30.120 --> 2:09:34.680]  particles actually they behave that's that's so striking about to be their
[2:09:34.680 --> 2:09:38.400]  behavior in a completely irrational way and you see that even more clear when
[2:09:38.400 --> 2:09:42.160]  you look at complex dynamical systems theory which showed paradoxically in a
[2:09:42.160 --> 2:09:47.200]  strictly rational way that each complex dynamical system in nature behaves
[2:09:47.200 --> 2:09:52.480]  strictly irrational as an irrational number meaning that science gives us no
[2:09:52.480 --> 2:09:57.520]  guarantee at all it's even completely discourages us to believe that society
[2:09:57.520 --> 2:10:02.200]  could be understood controlled and manipulated I mean how do you quantify
[2:10:02.200 --> 2:10:07.080]  that is from a sign of Berseria whatever built this doesn't like robots mm-hmm
[2:10:07.080 --> 2:10:10.520]  I mean how would you describe it well can can you come again that what I mean
[2:10:10.520 --> 2:10:15.560]  the universe it doesn't yes like no no no it's not going towards the order
[2:10:15.560 --> 2:10:19.520]  they're so no no no it wants us to have free will it forces us to have free will
[2:10:19.520 --> 2:10:23.440]  it confronts us constantly with choices that we cannot make on the basis of
[2:10:23.440 --> 2:10:27.760]  rational argumentation which if you have just entropy would be robotic the only
[2:10:27.760 --> 2:10:32.480]  way to make us more powerful is to give us constant yeah yeah indeed that's a I
[2:10:32.480 --> 2:10:38.480]  believe that's also the ultimate like like totalitarianism tries to destroy
[2:10:38.480 --> 2:10:43.840]  the space for a human being in which it has the inalienable right the ethical
[2:10:43.840 --> 2:10:48.320]  duty to make choices for itself to make singular subjective choices that's what
[2:10:48.320 --> 2:10:53.400]  totalitarianism because it is fed from the inside by an extreme anxiety for
[2:10:53.400 --> 2:10:58.640]  uncertainty totalitarianism totalitarianism totalitarian leaders always
[2:10:58.640 --> 2:11:01.960]  try to impose and what about the feedback loop because I don't know the
[2:11:01.960 --> 2:11:05.400]  psychology that's what I see in my own layman's terms the more you get into
[2:11:05.400 --> 2:11:09.160]  authoritarianism the more anxiety you have then the answer is more order when
[2:11:09.160 --> 2:11:12.640]  the answer is you don't want order yeah indeed that's the destructive vicious
[2:11:12.640 --> 2:11:16.320]  circle in which society arrives when it goes on a totalitarian trend I
[2:11:16.320 --> 2:11:19.760]  described it in the introduction already that that is exactly why the
[2:11:19.760 --> 2:11:24.040]  totalitarian system always self-destroys in the end the only thing you have to
[2:11:24.040 --> 2:11:28.640]  make sure and this is again from a strategical point of view so crucial the
[2:11:28.640 --> 2:11:33.560]  only thing you have to make sure is that there remains a path on which the
[2:11:33.560 --> 2:11:37.480]  people who do not go along with the system can walk and this part of the
[2:11:37.480 --> 2:11:43.320]  exit is factor there will be an exodus yeah there will be one so they're not
[2:11:43.320 --> 2:11:46.200]  just saying this to kiss your ass it's true you're very impressive in person
[2:11:46.200 --> 2:11:49.360]  more I did read your book real fast about a year ago and it was super hot and
[2:11:49.360 --> 2:11:52.520]  totally agree with it because I don't know what it made sense they're definitely
[2:11:52.520 --> 2:11:55.480]  scared of you and what I've learned is whatever they're scared of is what we
[2:11:55.480 --> 2:11:59.160]  should be supporting and they're not like fake scared they're really scared of
[2:11:59.160 --> 2:12:04.680]  me professor that's it you ought to be proud yes I consider it to be a small
[2:12:04.680 --> 2:12:10.240]  hummer yes that is true yes I you know actually they don't have to care of me
[2:12:10.240 --> 2:12:14.280]  I will tell you why just because if they would just embrace the real humanity
[2:12:14.280 --> 2:12:17.720]  yes indeed sorry I mean they're up go ahead if they would understand that
[2:12:17.720 --> 2:12:22.000]  totalitarianism will also destroy them they would know that they need this
[2:12:22.000 --> 2:12:25.560]  and you were gonna explain that went to break how is it gonna destroy them it
[2:12:25.560 --> 2:12:30.320]  will always you in the first place you can observe it historically that
[2:12:30.320 --> 2:12:36.240]  totalitarianism starts if it if it if it continues to to the stage in which it
[2:12:36.240 --> 2:12:40.480]  in which it starts to destroy the people who do not go along with it it starts to
[2:12:40.480 --> 2:12:46.320]  destroy that's its objective enemies the people who didn't go along with the
[2:12:46.320 --> 2:12:51.320]  ideology but that always needs more always more because it's it's it thrives
[2:12:51.320 --> 2:12:57.840]  on destruction the masses the masses have become a mass simply because they
[2:12:57.840 --> 2:13:01.920]  needed an object of anxiety they needed an object on which they could take their
[2:13:01.920 --> 2:13:06.760]  frustration and aggression on and the leaders know that if the masses wake up
[2:13:06.760 --> 2:13:10.880]  but they will destroy their leaders so both the masses and the leaders don't
[2:13:10.880 --> 2:13:15.440]  want the mass formation to stop meaning that once the original enemies are
[2:13:15.440 --> 2:13:19.560]  destroyed they always have to create a new enemy which is the car the purges and
[2:13:19.560 --> 2:13:23.960]  then and the Nazis and the communists and it's just obsessive it's obsessive and
[2:13:23.960 --> 2:13:29.640]  and in the Soviet Union this process this process went furthest of all at
[2:13:29.640 --> 2:13:34.560]  Nazi Germany was far less totalitarian than a Soviet Union and in the Soviet
[2:13:34.560 --> 2:13:38.800]  Union it started first with the aristocracy that had to be destroyed
[2:13:38.800 --> 2:13:42.280]  than the small farmers than the large marm farmers than the goldsmiths than the
[2:13:42.280 --> 2:13:47.480]  Jews and until then that was more or less rational if you if you were reasoning
[2:13:47.480 --> 2:13:51.280]  inside the ideology of the system because all these people were considered
[2:13:51.280 --> 2:13:55.960]  to be not capable of giving up their private property property but after a
[2:13:55.960 --> 2:14:01.720]  while everything was exterminated that could have been considered any
[2:14:01.720 --> 2:14:04.800]  competition is bad well I remember reading somewhere a linen quote before
[2:14:04.800 --> 2:14:07.960]  they poisoned him he died before strong to cover and they said sir we've killed
[2:14:07.960 --> 2:14:10.600]  all the opposition we're now really hurting ourselves he said don't
[2:14:10.600 --> 2:14:15.680]  understand I want more terror I want more blood of course I mean and then they
[2:14:15.680 --> 2:14:20.840]  just started randomly the putting people in the gulags and destroying them just
[2:14:20.840 --> 2:14:25.280]  because the system cannot exist without destroying someone and something and now
[2:14:25.280 --> 2:14:28.960]  we have Biden with a red background with troops saying I'm coming for you I
[2:14:28.960 --> 2:14:32.520]  agree with you it shows a sign of his weakness but it's still incredibly
[2:14:32.520 --> 2:14:36.760]  dangerous I don't know how we navigate that yes of course it's dangerous the
[2:14:36.760 --> 2:14:41.360]  only option we have so I that that's exactly what I meant if these people
[2:14:41.360 --> 2:14:46.240]  these totalitarians would understand that totalitarianism will become a
[2:14:46.240 --> 2:14:50.160]  monster that devours its own children to use a term of Hannah Arendt again they
[2:14:50.160 --> 2:14:55.040]  would understand that this decent these dissonant voices which they treat in
[2:14:55.040 --> 2:14:59.760]  such an intolerant way or exactly the only thing that can save them but they
[2:14:59.760 --> 2:15:04.120]  that's what we well they get they're getting rid of chivalry yes the rules
[2:15:04.120 --> 2:15:09.560]  of war because you don't want to get out of hand and it didn't show very kind of
[2:15:09.560 --> 2:15:13.080]  a primitive way to describe rules on this yes yes yes we don't let it get out
[2:15:13.080 --> 2:15:16.200]  of hand yes yes we're gonna kill each other but it's only to be men yes yes
[2:15:16.200 --> 2:15:22.840]  they don't have that that's the second chapter of salsin it's in is titled
[2:15:22.840 --> 2:15:28.760]  of salsin it's in the famous book the logo ago good luck archipelago yes is
[2:15:28.760 --> 2:15:33.560]  titled there is no law and totalitarian systems there are only
[2:15:33.560 --> 2:15:38.480]  totalitarian leaders always use local rules but never allow that applies to
[2:15:38.480 --> 2:15:43.160]  everything so they always reformulate it's all selectively enforced yes yes
[2:15:43.160 --> 2:15:46.640]  wow I'm impressed I know you got to go soon hopefully you stay with us longer

[2:19:53.480 --> 2:20:01.800]  available at info war store calm leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new
[2:20:01.800 --> 2:20:14.120]  world order it's alex jones well he's the author of the psychology of
[2:20:14.120 --> 2:20:18.440]  saltarianism professor but they has decimates for guests he's glad to say
[2:20:18.440 --> 2:20:22.160]  the rest of the hour the recallers that are holding if you want to hold I
[2:20:22.160 --> 2:20:24.880]  understand if you can't understand I'm gonna go ahead and just host the four
[2:20:24.880 --> 2:20:29.520]  sour after he leaves us but this is so central understanding how the world
[2:20:29.520 --> 2:20:34.160]  really works you you were getting for the break to the establishment the
[2:20:34.160 --> 2:20:38.400]  social programmers to understand the psychology that are using it but in
[2:20:38.400 --> 2:20:43.400]  their own ideology they're so strict on each other that has a its own feedback
[2:20:43.400 --> 2:20:48.960]  loop of them destroying themselves on a timeline how would you describe the
[2:20:48.960 --> 2:20:52.680]  world today and the fight between liberty and tyranny because Australia said
[2:20:52.680 --> 2:20:55.760]  the lockdowns would never end New Zealand said they would never end they had to end
[2:20:55.760 --> 2:21:00.480]  them nobody bought into it or the majority woke up all the sudden so at
[2:21:00.480 --> 2:21:04.880]  first it was front-loaded where most were going along with it now everybody
[2:21:04.880 --> 2:21:08.840]  wakes up or the majority do that blows up in their face and now they seem dumb
[2:21:08.840 --> 2:21:11.880]  found it same thing in Europe same thing in Canada same thing here so they're
[2:21:11.880 --> 2:21:17.760]  trying to fire that back up again but did they really kind of shoot their wad
[2:21:17.760 --> 2:21:24.160]  with the virus gear and what do you think they may be planning next I think
[2:21:24.160 --> 2:21:31.600]  that to be honest I think that we are only in the beginning of the we are in
[2:21:31.600 --> 2:21:37.360]  the beginning of the end game I think that means that we will soon see the
[2:21:37.360 --> 2:21:42.160]  introduction of the digital coins issued by central banks we will see the
[2:21:42.160 --> 2:21:47.680]  introduction of digital IDs and so on so I think the process the technocratic
[2:21:47.680 --> 2:21:53.360]  system will be pushed further I'm quite sure about sure about that but and
[2:21:53.360 --> 2:21:57.760]  that's the point again if we continue to manifest in public space to speak out
[2:21:57.760 --> 2:22:01.480]  in public space and so on there will be a small path we will be the people who
[2:22:01.480 --> 2:22:05.200]  do not want to go willing go along will be excommunicated that thing but we will
[2:22:05.200 --> 2:22:09.040]  have to survive there but it'll be those heretics that build the new world yes
[2:22:09.040 --> 2:22:13.280]  indeed exactly they will discover the principles the new principles of a new
[2:22:13.280 --> 2:22:16.640]  living together I'm sure about that so that's exactly if you read again
[2:22:16.640 --> 2:22:20.280]  Solstynicin or Victor Frankl or Primo Levi you got cut off of a Solstynicin
[2:22:20.280 --> 2:22:23.800]  part of the book yes yes let me get back to that you were what was I saying
[2:22:23.800 --> 2:22:26.960]  about that part but there is no law yes there is no law indeed but I was
[2:22:26.960 --> 2:22:31.360]  referring now to the fact Solstynicin describes describes something typical a
[2:22:31.360 --> 2:22:37.360]  typical experience that happens in a totalitarian state in the people who
[2:22:37.360 --> 2:22:41.680]  do not go along with the system like totalitarianism is an extreme
[2:22:41.680 --> 2:22:45.360]  dehumanization of the world in a totalitarian system there are simply
[2:22:45.360 --> 2:22:50.640]  no principles of humanity anymore the the ideological system and the
[2:22:50.640 --> 2:22:56.400]  ideological fiction is so relentlessly imposed to the world and according to
[2:22:56.400 --> 2:23:00.600]  Hannah Arendt the concentration camps where the ultimate goal of a totalitarian
[2:23:00.600 --> 2:23:05.240]  system in the concentration camps you had an elite that relentlessly not
[2:23:05.240 --> 2:23:10.120]  hampered by any law or principle imposed its totalitarian doctrine to a
[2:23:10.120 --> 2:23:15.640]  population that she said the striving of all totalitarianism is to make the
[2:23:15.640 --> 2:23:21.360]  entire world into an open concentration camp that's what she said so but if
[2:23:21.360 --> 2:23:25.200]  under these and every form of authoritarianism always goes towards that
[2:23:25.200 --> 2:23:30.360]  yes it tends towards that but but if there is an opposition who continues to
[2:23:30.360 --> 2:23:33.040]  speak out no I mean I agree doesn't always happen but that's always their
[2:23:33.040 --> 2:23:37.520]  goal yes that's a goal that absolutely this is up it just it's just this this
[2:23:37.520 --> 2:23:40.640]  I want to be flying around like the Jetsons and people living to be 500
[2:23:40.640 --> 2:23:45.160]  everybody being happy like that's the Renaissance I would say I mean they just
[2:23:45.160 --> 2:23:49.760]  where do they get this instinct to dominate and murder people oh yeah
[2:23:49.760 --> 2:23:56.280]  indeed that's a that's that's the most basic and elementary psychological
[2:23:56.280 --> 2:24:01.520]  instinct that there exists the human being distinguishes itself from an
[2:24:01.520 --> 2:24:06.640]  animal because it is constantly confronted with uncertainty an animal
[2:24:06.640 --> 2:24:10.880]  the mental system of a man of an animal works through a science system in which
[2:24:10.880 --> 2:24:15.080]  every sign refers to one object and there is no substantial doubt in the
[2:24:15.080 --> 2:24:19.480]  animals mind because of that but a human being the human mind a human mind
[2:24:19.480 --> 2:24:24.440]  works with language and in language the signs or the words do not refer to one
[2:24:24.440 --> 2:24:28.160]  object they refer to other words they get their meaning to other words and
[2:24:28.160 --> 2:24:32.600]  these other words have to receive their meaning again from other words and in
[2:24:32.600 --> 2:24:37.600]  this way we always lack a word to be sure that's so typical for a human being
[2:24:37.600 --> 2:24:41.960]  it's life and existence circles constantly around something that it's
[2:24:41.960 --> 2:24:46.560]  its mind cannot grasp a human being is constantly confronted with elementary
[2:24:46.560 --> 2:24:51.080]  questions such as what is the meaning of my life does my wife loves me does my
[2:24:51.080 --> 2:24:55.320]  do I mean something to other people and so on and it's always a lack of
[2:24:55.320 --> 2:25:00.040]  confidence it's a lack of concepts it's uncertainty and form for many people
[2:25:00.040 --> 2:25:03.560]  maybe forever you want to a certain extent extent this fundamental
[2:25:03.560 --> 2:25:08.000]  uncertainty leads to anxiety and you can react to that in two ways you can
[2:25:08.000 --> 2:25:13.600]  react to that by trying to eliminate the uncertainty trying to impose a theory
[2:25:13.600 --> 2:25:18.040]  as if it is certain to reality that I just kill all these people they won't
[2:25:18.040 --> 2:25:21.520]  have free will and won't cause problems yeah and that's what totalitarianism
[2:25:21.520 --> 2:25:24.600]  does that's what totalitarianism does but there is also that's why they always try
[2:25:24.600 --> 2:25:30.000]  that's what there is this intrinsic inherent tendency in a human being to
[2:25:30.000 --> 2:25:33.640]  choose for adoption but and totalitarianist do that but there is
[2:25:33.640 --> 2:25:39.200]  also another option this uncertainty and this uncertainty you can you can
[2:25:39.200 --> 2:25:45.360]  recognize the fundamental precondition to be a human being because if you know
[2:25:45.360 --> 2:25:49.560]  that you were uncertain and that everyone is uncertain then you can also
[2:25:49.560 --> 2:25:55.360]  know that you have you there is no other option than that you make your own
[2:25:55.360 --> 2:26:01.560]  individual free choices nobody else has the right to impose and historically
[2:26:01.560 --> 2:26:05.560]  individuals making those decisions is decentralized and builds a better world
[2:26:05.560 --> 2:26:11.360]  yes of course yes yes indeed that's a case you can make two choices in the
[2:26:11.360 --> 2:26:15.000]  confrontation with uncertainty you can choose to let the uncertainty lead to
[2:26:15.000 --> 2:26:19.560]  anxiety and to act upon that anxiety and try to impose your theory in such a way
[2:26:19.560 --> 2:26:23.360]  that there is no uncertainty and so is Orwell right that the power lies with
[2:26:23.360 --> 2:26:28.680]  the proletariat to use you know marks and Ingalls thing or or is it in the
[2:26:28.680 --> 2:26:32.720]  establishment or is it just whoever comes out of whatever area every the
[2:26:32.720 --> 2:26:37.960]  power lies and everyone who has the courage to embrace its freedom and to
[2:26:37.960 --> 2:26:44.000]  take responsibility for his own choices to take risks in life and to say I am
[2:26:44.000 --> 2:26:48.680]  the one who has to make a choices nobody there is no master who can tell me what
[2:26:48.680 --> 2:26:52.160]  I have to do wouldn't it be easier for the elites that go along with each other
[2:26:52.160 --> 2:26:56.000]  and are all authoritarian don't they get if they were like rogue agents against it
[2:26:56.000 --> 2:26:59.440]  even even they just want power they'd be way more powerful in powering humanity
[2:26:59.440 --> 2:27:03.120]  I don't get why they go into this this this this destructive bit of
[2:27:03.120 --> 2:27:07.360]  authoritarianism yes but that's madness that that's exactly that's exactly
[2:27:07.360 --> 2:27:12.280]  a classical dictator can be awake he is not hypnotized a classical dictator can
[2:27:12.280 --> 2:27:15.960]  use his common sense and that's why classical dictatorships can continue to
[2:27:15.960 --> 2:27:21.280]  exist if the classical dictator loves his population a little bit then the
[2:27:21.280 --> 2:27:25.600]  total a classical dictatorship that's a philosopher king yes yes the
[2:27:25.600 --> 2:27:29.800]  philosopher king indeed exact now but a totalitarian leader is hypnotized by his
[2:27:29.800 --> 2:27:34.440]  own ideology not by his own narratives the narratives that he uses the climate
[2:27:34.440 --> 2:27:39.640]  narrative the terrorism narrative the corona narrative or propaganda and
[2:27:39.640 --> 2:27:45.440]  totalitarian leaders know that they are so convinced so fanatically convinced
[2:27:45.440 --> 2:27:49.360]  that their own ideology is the only true ideology that they believe it is
[2:27:49.360 --> 2:27:53.120]  justifies that is just that is so powerful because I've watched hundreds of
[2:27:53.120 --> 2:27:57.040]  hours of devils great meetings which is the mouthpiece of these people and they
[2:27:57.040 --> 2:28:00.280]  they I can tell real people when they're being real they're like we're so
[2:28:00.280 --> 2:28:04.720]  beautiful we're building utopia why don't why are they fighting us they
[2:28:04.720 --> 2:28:09.640]  literally don't even know I mean this is a cult and they are absolutely they
[2:28:09.640 --> 2:28:14.920]  Hannah Arendt said the totalitarian leaders are always convinced that they
[2:28:14.920 --> 2:28:18.720]  will create paradise but the only problem is that their paradise looks
[2:28:18.720 --> 2:28:24.000]  always suspiciously a lot on an inferno on a help and indeed so they are
[2:28:24.000 --> 2:28:28.080]  convinced themselves that they will reshape society into a new paradise in
[2:28:28.080 --> 2:28:31.560]  which there are no limitations anymore in which a human being will live
[2:28:31.560 --> 2:28:35.520]  eternally in which it will constantly experience a biochemically induced
[2:28:35.520 --> 2:28:39.760]  happiness and so on they are so fanatic another degree convinced that they
[2:28:39.760 --> 2:28:44.400]  think it is justified to claim millions of victims billions of victims to
[2:28:44.400 --> 2:28:49.600]  realize it and that's that's always been the hallmark of my god well you talk

[2:34:02.240 --> 2:34:10.880]  was talking about this most important aspect of the solution which is always
[2:34:10.880 --> 2:34:14.360]  to continue to speak out because we are dealing with a psychological process and
[2:34:14.360 --> 2:34:18.400]  as I said the totalitarian leader is hypnotized himself not by his narratives
[2:34:18.400 --> 2:34:22.640]  but by the ideologies by the ideologies meaning that the dissonant
[2:34:22.640 --> 2:34:27.200]  voices even have an impact on the leaders so it's crucial to speak out
[2:34:27.200 --> 2:34:33.520]  that's that's the one the first and foremost strategical rule which is at
[2:34:33.520 --> 2:34:38.400]  the same time I believe also an ethical rule because as a human being we all
[2:34:38.400 --> 2:34:41.720]  have the ethical duty to try to articulate the words that the
[2:34:41.720 --> 2:34:45.840]  emergence and that seems sincere and honest if we don't do that we slowly lose
[2:34:45.840 --> 2:34:53.760]  our soul and it is exactly this the fact if the fact that we stick to the
[2:34:53.760 --> 2:34:58.160]  principle of speaking out that will make us stronger that's crucial Solzhenitsyn
[2:34:58.160 --> 2:35:02.640]  describes that in a in the Gulag Archipelago just like Viktor Frankl just
[2:35:02.640 --> 2:35:06.840]  like Primo Levi they describe that those people who in the concentration camps
[2:35:06.840 --> 2:35:14.360]  in this dehumanizing world in this pool of darkness those people who the most
[2:35:14.360 --> 2:35:17.760]  most prisoners in the concentration camps started to behave in a beast-like
[2:35:17.760 --> 2:35:21.880]  manner in a brutish way they lost all sense of humanity but there was there
[2:35:21.880 --> 2:35:25.920]  was a small minority Solzhenitsyn said who went in exactly the opposite
[2:35:25.920 --> 2:35:30.280]  direction who tried to represent in this pool of darkness a little bit of light
[2:35:30.280 --> 2:35:35.240]  and who became more and more determined to stick to the ethical principles of
[2:35:35.240 --> 2:35:39.880]  humanity and Solzhenitsyn gives wonderful examples in his book very
[2:35:39.880 --> 2:35:46.800]  often these people slowly became stronger both mentally and physically he
[2:35:46.800 --> 2:35:50.280]  gives us wonderful examples in which several of these people survived the
[2:35:50.280 --> 2:35:54.680]  constant the concentration camps for 15 years while most of them died in a few
[2:35:54.680 --> 2:36:00.800]  weeks to a few months and I think I cannot go into detail now but that is
[2:36:00.800 --> 2:36:09.280]  just so crucial did the fact that this it is this if we do our best to continue
[2:36:09.280 --> 2:36:13.720]  to speak out in a sincere and the honest way then you will see that we go
[2:36:13.720 --> 2:36:19.120]  through this fast process of human of evolution while the rest of the
[2:36:19.120 --> 2:36:22.840]  world becomes weaker and weaker and weaker at the psychological level so and
[2:36:22.840 --> 2:36:27.560]  at the same time we will prevent we will make sure that there remains a path on
[2:36:27.560 --> 2:36:31.080]  which we can continue to walk and we will make sure that the masses don't
[2:36:31.080 --> 2:36:34.040]  become so destructive that they radically self-destroy so that's the
[2:36:34.040 --> 2:36:39.840]  generally speaking the the most elementary strategic advice and just to
[2:36:39.840 --> 2:36:43.240]  throw a quick question to continue historically we see points where either
[2:36:43.240 --> 2:36:46.160]  the general public breaks with the establishment or the establishment breaks
[2:36:46.160 --> 2:36:50.520]  with themselves on that timeline is there ways to jump ahead and get the
[2:36:50.520 --> 2:36:54.920]  establishment not to be so suicidal and in a death cult or we just have to go
[2:36:54.920 --> 2:36:59.920]  through the process I don't know we probably will go to the through the
[2:36:59.920 --> 2:37:03.440]  process to a certain extent it's always difficult to predict exactly what will
[2:37:03.440 --> 2:37:07.320]  happen Niels Bohr had this wonderful quote he said prediction is always
[2:37:07.320 --> 2:37:11.160]  difficult and definitely if it is about the future it's very hard to know
[2:37:11.160 --> 2:37:15.080]  society has always a complex dynamical system and it's very hard to know the
[2:37:15.080 --> 2:37:18.400]  complex dynamical systems cannot be predicted they always can behave in
[2:37:18.400 --> 2:37:22.400]  different sure even though in the past we don't know it's oh indeed yes yes the
[2:37:22.400 --> 2:37:25.680]  only thing that is for sure I think is that we were dealing with an emergent
[2:37:25.680 --> 2:37:33.160]  emerging totalitarianism not fascist or a communist totalitarianism but kind of
[2:37:33.160 --> 2:37:37.360]  totalitarianism which Hannah Arendt warned us already for in 1951 she wrote
[2:37:37.360 --> 2:37:40.960]  in her book the origins of totalitarianism she wrote we've seen
[2:37:40.960 --> 2:37:46.840]  fascist totalitarianism collapse we've seen a communist totalitarianism losing
[2:37:46.840 --> 2:37:51.480]  its power slowly but she said we will we will witness the emergence of a new
[2:37:51.480 --> 2:37:55.480]  kind of totalitarianism a kind of totalitarianism which is no longer
[2:37:55.480 --> 2:38:00.560]  led by gang leaders such as Tallinn and Hitler but which is led by dull
[2:38:00.560 --> 2:38:04.200]  bureaucrats and technocrats and that's what we are dealing with now the
[2:38:04.200 --> 2:38:09.360]  technocrats totalitarianism the ultimate totalitarianism which is the it's so
[2:38:09.360 --> 2:38:14.080]  faceless and it's it's just no indeed there is no mythology anymore involved
[2:38:14.080 --> 2:38:20.280]  or something no it's pure dry manifestation I agree you can't call
[2:38:20.280 --> 2:38:25.360]  it communist or fascist I call it a scientific dictatorship pseudo
[2:38:25.360 --> 2:38:28.840]  scientific detail dictatorship yes sure I wouldn't call them science I'm saying
[2:38:28.840 --> 2:38:32.360]  how she says I'm science I'm saying they're using scientific principles and
[2:38:32.360 --> 2:38:36.600]  psychology against people just for pure power for themselves even though they're
[2:38:36.600 --> 2:38:41.320]  creating a hellish world for themselves I mean indeed and ending the solution to
[2:38:41.320 --> 2:38:45.960]  the problem the most basic solution the most important solution is actually
[2:38:45.960 --> 2:38:52.000]  that we have to move beyond this pseudo scientific ideology we are living in
[2:38:52.000 --> 2:38:58.240]  then and the seminal scientists actually show this how we have to do that the
[2:38:58.240 --> 2:39:01.560]  seminal scientists whether we are talking about Max Planck Niels Bohr Schreuden
[2:39:01.560 --> 2:39:11.040]  Bergheisinger Mandelbrot René Tom they all told us the same this in every
[2:39:11.040 --> 2:39:14.560]  process of knowing the world there are two stages and the first is always
[2:39:14.560 --> 2:39:18.160]  rational knowledge and many people think that this rational knowledge is
[2:39:18.160 --> 2:39:22.000]  everything that's what these people who are now sees in control of society
[2:39:22.000 --> 2:39:25.800]  believe that society should be based on the rational understanding but every
[2:39:25.800 --> 2:39:29.360]  scientist real scientist knows that the rational understanding is only the first
[2:39:29.360 --> 2:39:36.800]  place place of gathering knowledge that after rational understanding there
[2:39:36.800 --> 2:39:41.320]  comes something else if you really in a honest way try to rational under to
[2:39:41.320 --> 2:39:45.200]  understand rationally then you will soon arrive at the limit of rational
[2:39:45.200 --> 2:39:49.120]  understanding and it is at the limit of rational understanding you have the
[2:39:49.120 --> 2:39:54.240]  chance to move on to a different way of knowing the world which is much more
[2:39:54.240 --> 2:39:59.880]  resonating way of knowing the world which is what René Tom said and then an
[2:39:59.880 --> 2:40:03.960]  empathic or an empathic resonance with the world also the Samurai knew this
[2:40:03.960 --> 2:40:08.320]  very well they said like when you when you learn the martial arts the first
[2:40:08.320 --> 2:40:12.800]  there is a technical rational stage in which you practice the techniques of
[2:40:12.800 --> 2:40:16.200]  the martial arts but if you practice the techniques of a martial art for a
[2:40:16.200 --> 2:40:20.480]  long time then you will then you will slowly develop a certain feel for what
[2:40:20.480 --> 2:40:26.200]  you do and it is this resonating feeling knowledge that is the real knowledge
[2:40:26.200 --> 2:40:31.600]  there Samurai went even so far to say that it's difficult to learn the
[2:40:31.600 --> 2:40:35.720]  techniques of a martial art but that it is even more difficult to forget them
[2:40:35.720 --> 2:40:40.520]  again and they said if you don't succeed and forgetting the techniques of the
[2:40:40.520 --> 2:40:44.680]  martial arts again before you go to the battlefield you will die on the
[2:40:44.680 --> 2:40:49.240]  battlefield they said you have to move on to a different kind of knowledge a
[2:40:49.240 --> 2:40:52.720]  different kind of practice in the world and that you can't be caught up in that
[2:40:52.720 --> 2:40:57.160]  basic program you've got it then it's like a unified field theory of just
[2:40:57.160 --> 2:41:00.560]  interfacing or you're still an individual you're creating a real
[2:41:00.560 --> 2:41:04.120]  collective that can't be artificially created by the authoritarian but the
[2:41:04.120 --> 2:41:08.680]  beginning of the almost perfection is that there is it it's all interconnected
[2:41:08.680 --> 2:41:14.440]  no indeed yes that is a real connection with the world indeed it is this
[2:41:14.440 --> 2:41:18.920]  resonating empathic knowledge that really connects you to the world around you to
[2:41:18.920 --> 2:41:23.240]  the people around you that's the ultimate antidote for totalitarian and
[2:41:23.240 --> 2:41:27.000]  people look for completion cuz I mean I'm not perfect but I'm really satisfied
[2:41:27.000 --> 2:41:30.800]  and now that I've gotten older and been through all this I can now like interface
[2:41:30.800 --> 2:41:34.320]  with things and it's so it's so satisfying it's like a drug and then I
[2:41:34.320 --> 2:41:37.960]  just get frustrated that other people aren't interfacing with me indeed
[2:41:37.960 --> 2:41:44.120]  exactly what would you call that when you surpass the knowledge I mean what is
[2:41:44.120 --> 2:41:49.400]  that it's a transcendent it's a transcendent experience and Max Planck
[2:41:49.400 --> 2:41:54.400]  really articulated this in a wonderful way Max Planck said I've given my life
[2:41:54.400 --> 2:41:59.560]  to science I've studied matter and atoms my entire life and it won him it won him
[2:41:59.560 --> 2:42:06.600]  the Nobel Prize and he said but in the end I believe that science arrives where
[2:42:06.600 --> 2:42:11.960]  religion once started in an authentic personal contact with that what
[2:42:11.960 --> 2:42:16.320]  transcends all rational understanding and Max Planck said and to be clear he
[2:42:16.320 --> 2:42:21.680]  said that what transcends all rational understanding for me as a personal god
[2:42:21.680 --> 2:42:30.080]  and I believe indeed that we all if we really follow rationality in a honest
[2:42:30.080 --> 2:42:34.400]  and sincere way we will all arrive at that point where we feel just like all
[2:42:34.400 --> 2:42:38.440]  the major scientists have felt that we arrive at the limit of rationality and
[2:42:38.440 --> 2:42:46.040]  that it is there that we can choose we can go back and try to understand
[2:42:46.040 --> 2:42:49.600]  rationality but can never be rationally understood and in this way we arrive in
[2:42:49.600 --> 2:42:53.280]  absurd irrationality and that's what the system let's explain that this is so

[2:47:23.920 --> 2:47:29.240]  to that point of those that want to claim their own science and then control
[2:47:29.240 --> 2:47:34.280]  free will and what is your message the general public versus your message to
[2:47:34.280 --> 2:47:38.280]  the technocrats who really believe they have a final revolution they have a way
[2:47:38.280 --> 2:47:42.360]  of finally becoming god they're gonna use us as their guinea pigs to transcend
[2:47:42.360 --> 2:47:46.960]  but they've given up on their very basic humanity itself and I know some of these
[2:47:46.960 --> 2:47:50.960]  globalists they're not very happy people as the message the message to the
[2:47:50.960 --> 2:47:59.560]  elite is clear they just should understand that they will never become god
[2:47:59.560 --> 2:48:04.640]  their rational understanding is extremely limited and that the more they try to
[2:48:04.640 --> 2:48:10.400]  reduce life and the essence of life to rationality they will just destroy life
[2:48:10.400 --> 2:48:15.160]  if you try to reduce the essence of life to something that it doesn't is then
[2:48:15.160 --> 2:48:20.680]  you inevitably destroy life so I hope that the elite the people who identify
[2:48:20.680 --> 2:48:25.160]  with the system that they realize that in the end they will destroy themselves
[2:48:25.160 --> 2:48:31.160]  the their system will become a monster that devours its own its own take the
[2:48:31.160 --> 2:48:34.800]  shots they don't protect you they make you sick that's not rational I mean if
[2:48:34.800 --> 2:48:37.160]  they were gonna come out with something and make us take it why didn't they give
[2:48:37.160 --> 2:48:40.240]  us something that worked I mean it's it's everything an authoritarian does
[2:48:40.240 --> 2:48:43.840]  always goes to crap yes but that happened already in the Soviet Union all
[2:48:43.840 --> 2:48:47.200]  the yes absolute absolute so they think they're rational but they're not no
[2:48:47.200 --> 2:48:51.120]  right they're definitely or not it's it's that's that's the problem if you do
[2:48:51.120 --> 2:48:55.440]  not accept if you believe that rationality is limitless that it can
[2:48:55.440 --> 2:49:01.000]  explain everything then you inevitably end up in radical absurd irrationality
[2:49:01.000 --> 2:49:04.640]  that has always been the case that's so typical that's also when the
[2:49:04.640 --> 2:49:08.600]  architecture is ugly the people die young there's crime everywhere it just
[2:49:08.600 --> 2:49:13.680]  doesn't work no no it doesn't work indeed indeed doesn't work and so that
[2:49:13.680 --> 2:49:18.960]  would be the message to the elite please follows real science and you will see
[2:49:18.960 --> 2:49:24.240]  it there before your own eyes in a way that cannot be denied that there is a
[2:49:24.240 --> 2:49:28.960]  limited rationality in that rationality will never allow us to grasp the essence
[2:49:28.960 --> 2:49:35.120]  of life around us even more the more we enclose ourselves in a in a wall of
[2:49:35.120 --> 2:49:39.240]  logical building blocks the more we isolate ourselves from life around us
[2:49:39.240 --> 2:49:45.440]  and it is first at the moment when we start to realize that our capacity for
[2:49:45.440 --> 2:49:49.280]  rational understanding is limited that the building blocks of the logical wall
[2:49:49.280 --> 2:49:53.960]  will slide open a little bit and that the eternal life of music will be able to
[2:49:53.960 --> 2:49:57.560]  go through the holes of the wall and touch the strings of our body and soul
[2:49:57.560 --> 2:50:02.720]  and at that moment we will start to resonate with the eat with the eternal
[2:50:02.720 --> 2:50:08.240]  vibrant spirit of life and that's the moment where we will not need to become
[2:50:08.240 --> 2:50:14.760]  God anymore because we will be part participate and an eternal spirit which
[2:50:14.760 --> 2:50:19.360]  will also take away the anxiety for death and dying well there's no need to
[2:50:19.360 --> 2:50:23.400]  become God we're already part of God we are part of it we participate in it and
[2:50:23.400 --> 2:50:30.800]  so I think that's the beauty of this resonating knowledge it brings you in
[2:50:30.800 --> 2:50:36.120]  touch with something eternal and that's the basic disease of our culture is that
[2:50:36.120 --> 2:50:40.360]  we cannot tolerate the idea of that and dying anymore and why did all these
[2:50:40.360 --> 2:50:44.200]  ancient cultures start targeting firstborn and wanting to kill children
[2:50:44.200 --> 2:50:47.960]  there's an obsession with destroying children's destiny their own free will
[2:50:47.960 --> 2:50:51.200]  I mean I guess that's just that authoritarian instinct but it's it's
[2:50:51.200 --> 2:50:57.480]  so obvious yes yes of course it is of course it is yes and like if I would if
[2:50:57.480 --> 2:51:05.840]  I could give a message to the population I would definitely say this is a time
[2:51:05.840 --> 2:51:12.240]  in which we have to reinvent and to re-appreciate the importance of ethical
[2:51:12.240 --> 2:51:17.040]  principles for a human being we should not focus too much on trying to know
[2:51:17.040 --> 2:51:20.240]  what will happen next trying to understand what will happen we have to
[2:51:20.240 --> 2:51:23.120]  try to understand I also try to understand you're right be good and
[2:51:23.120 --> 2:51:27.080]  stand up for what's right and that will change the world stick to your principles
[2:51:27.080 --> 2:51:37.520]  and and please realize that if you live up to these principles humanity will
[2:51:37.520 --> 2:51:42.000]  survive we can never be sure that there will be victims among us that's almost
[2:51:42.000 --> 2:51:46.520]  unavoidable but even then we have to stick to our principles and we have to
[2:51:46.520 --> 2:51:51.520]  know that all violence will be used against us it will be used against us
[2:51:51.520 --> 2:52:00.200]  we have to be determined and firm and manifest speak out refuse to conform we
[2:52:00.200 --> 2:52:04.880]  have to use all all the techniques and strategies strategies of non-violent
[2:52:04.880 --> 2:52:08.160]  resistance but absolutely but when we just to quantify that not inside of
[2:52:08.160 --> 2:52:12.040]  terms just to my own layman's terms I'm an individualist and I believe in total
[2:52:12.040 --> 2:52:15.640]  individuality but it's a total collectivism in my decision your decision
[2:52:15.640 --> 2:52:19.240]  it builds a collective will and they claim their collectivist but they're
[2:52:19.240 --> 2:52:23.360]  actually obviously going against the real will of humanity to strive and be
[2:52:23.360 --> 2:52:27.560]  successful and build all these things and I just can't believe how obvious it
[2:52:27.560 --> 2:52:31.480]  is but they go against it because you said they're afraid of the randomness of
[2:52:31.480 --> 2:52:37.760]  freedom yes of course of course because because indeed and and we don't have to
[2:52:37.760 --> 2:52:41.400]  follow the bill of the collective because that's that's totalitarianism
[2:52:41.400 --> 2:52:45.280]  totalitarianism artificial extreme collectivism yes extreme and which
[2:52:45.280 --> 2:52:49.800]  destroys all individualism instead of trying to install a balance between
[2:52:49.800 --> 2:52:53.640]  individualism and collectivism totalitarianism is extreme collectivism
[2:52:53.640 --> 2:53:00.720]  which destroys the human individual mind and soul so it's not we should not like
[2:53:00.720 --> 2:53:05.280]  it's not a virtue to follow the will of the collective not at all it's even the
[2:53:05.280 --> 2:53:09.600]  most dangerous and the most unethical thing you can do it's what we have to do
[2:53:09.600 --> 2:53:15.440]  is to follow ethical principles we have to understand our enlightenment our
[2:53:15.440 --> 2:53:19.040]  our enlightenment tradition believed that the rational understanding should be
[2:53:19.040 --> 2:53:23.560]  the basis of human living together but that is not true at all rational
[2:53:23.560 --> 2:53:27.040]  understanding can never be the basis of true living of human living together
[2:53:27.040 --> 2:53:31.320]  only ethical principles can be and you will well sure I'm so-called rational
[2:53:31.320 --> 2:53:35.480]  Bill Gates says kill an old lady and hire 10 teachers but if we build a
[2:53:35.480 --> 2:53:39.680]  culture to take care of the old ladies that's a more complex loving culture that
[2:53:39.680 --> 2:53:43.680]  isn't predatory I mean it's just I mean that's an oversimplification of it but
[2:53:43.680 --> 2:53:48.480]  the stupid idea of its rational if I kill an old person and get their money I
[2:53:48.480 --> 2:53:52.240]  do better no you just killed old people isn't it just and then nobody cares
[2:53:52.240 --> 2:53:55.840]  about me by everything falls apart mmm that makes sense yeah that makes sense
[2:53:55.840 --> 2:53:59.920]  of course it is yes well in closing we got about four minutes left what else
[2:53:59.920 --> 2:54:03.320]  professor very impressive the psychology totalitarianism what else would you like
[2:54:03.320 --> 2:54:10.560]  to say in closing yes well there is a lot still a lot to be said I think that
[2:54:10.560 --> 2:54:17.400]  it is extremely important from time to time to step back to take like more a
[2:54:17.400 --> 2:54:21.920]  helicopter view and to try to understand the large principles at work both of
[2:54:21.920 --> 2:54:26.680]  totalitarianism and both of the resistance and to understand that indeed as
[2:54:26.680 --> 2:54:32.960]  you just underlined a few minutes ago to understand that what in the end will be
[2:54:32.960 --> 2:54:39.400]  decisive and what will matter will always be whether we succeed in sticking to
[2:54:39.400 --> 2:54:43.720]  ethical print to the principles of humanity that will be decisive at first
[2:54:43.720 --> 2:54:47.920]  sight it will seem that violence is the only solution that we have to destroy
[2:54:47.920 --> 2:54:52.600]  this evil elite in a violent revolution and that will be exactly what will
[2:54:52.600 --> 2:54:59.000]  destroy us that's what the elite wants that will be what creates the support in
[2:54:59.000 --> 2:55:03.160]  a population to push forward their destruction campaign so that is what
[2:55:03.160 --> 2:55:09.520]  we absolutely should avoid if we avoid that you will both lose at the tactical
[2:55:09.520 --> 2:55:13.080]  level and you will lose at the ethical level I totally agree professor but the
[2:55:13.080 --> 2:55:17.320]  problem is the establishment is going to provocateur a stage of events even if
[2:55:17.320 --> 2:55:20.440]  we're not violent so how do you counter that yes but they will never have enough
[2:55:20.440 --> 2:55:24.080]  support if if we continue to speak out and if we continue to behave in an
[2:55:24.080 --> 2:55:28.040]  ethical way that's the point we have to see that it is a psychological game it's
[2:55:28.040 --> 2:55:31.040]  a psychological agreement of biden's people blow up a federal building tomorrow
[2:55:31.040 --> 2:55:34.480]  and blame us how do we counter that I guess the public's got to be informed
[2:55:34.480 --> 2:55:37.320]  enough to know we didn't do that we didn't stand for that and that only
[2:55:37.320 --> 2:55:42.040]  helps them yeah if we if we deal with that in a in a in the right way in the
[2:55:42.040 --> 2:55:47.440]  end it will turn against Joe Biden that's why they have to try to move we
[2:55:47.440 --> 2:55:50.440]  have to follow the rules of the martial arts if you're confronted with a
[2:55:50.440 --> 2:55:57.960]  powerful enemy use his power against him judo yes or ninjutsu or jijutsu yes no
[2:55:57.960 --> 2:56:01.920]  all right how do people people can get your book work your website where do
[2:56:01.920 --> 2:56:07.960]  people find you professor on my sub-stack Mattias Puntus Matt and M-A-T-T-I-A-S
[2:56:07.960 --> 2:56:14.040]  Desmond M-A-T-T-I-A-S yes Desmond dot sub-stack dot-com the book the
[2:56:14.040 --> 2:56:18.800]  psycho the psychology of totalitarianism yes you can order it well you're having
[2:56:18.800 --> 2:56:21.280]  a big effect are definitely afraid of you and everything you say rings true I
[2:56:21.280 --> 2:56:25.600]  don't know all the psychological terms but this seems like inherent truth thank
[2:56:25.600 --> 2:56:32.520]  you and thank and where are you going next I don't know actually but you're
[2:56:32.520 --> 2:56:36.600]  doing a tour for the next few days and back to yes yes there are still a few
[2:56:36.600 --> 2:56:39.760]  appointments but I don't know I have people who take care of that very well
[2:56:39.760 --> 2:56:44.520]  and I'm very happy that they do so so I can just enjoy a certain I don't have to
[2:56:44.520 --> 2:56:48.840]  know my schedule and I like that well this was a real talk and definitely very
[2:56:48.840 --> 2:56:52.560]  very deep and I would just put this way the cerebral cortex cannot interface
[2:56:52.560 --> 2:56:56.680]  with how powerful our subconscious is many times were powerful obviously how
[2:56:56.680 --> 2:56:59.160]  many times were powerful would you say on average the subconscious isn't them
[2:56:59.160 --> 2:57:03.560]  than the gorgeous can you come can you come I mean like the rest of your brain
[2:57:03.560 --> 2:57:07.640]  compared to cerebral cortex how much more time is powerful oh the unconscious is
[2:57:07.640 --> 2:57:11.800]  everything yes so so the same thing the rationalists are thinking like only
[2:57:11.800 --> 2:57:15.920]  their focus is everything yes but by us saying no it's bigger it's just embracing
[2:57:15.920 --> 2:57:19.320]  all of course of course for instance people who are in the grip of a
[2:57:19.320 --> 2:57:22.160]  mass formation believes that their narrative is the only one that is
[2:57:22.160 --> 2:57:25.240]  correct and true and that all the rest is unscientific and they don't know that
[2:57:25.240 --> 2:57:29.680]  it's as irrational as it can be and that the reasons why they buy into this
[2:57:29.680 --> 2:57:33.080]  narrative are completely situated at a different level they were situated to the
[2:57:33.080 --> 2:57:38.840]  level of the effective at the control of anxiety at the satisfaction that goes
[2:57:38.840 --> 2:57:43.200]  hand-in-hand with taking out your aggressive aggression amazing I'm I'm

[2:59:48.160 --> 2:59:57.040]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones
[2:59:57.040 --> 3:00:07.000]  somewhere from a special place in hell saw a linsky forced to watch c-span for
[3:00:07.000 --> 3:00:13.520]  eternity is laughing I suppose given a choice I think I would take hell reveling
[3:00:13.520 --> 3:00:19.080]  in Joe Biden's textbook example of a speech utilizing every rule for radicals
[3:00:19.080 --> 3:00:24.240]  he could jam in too much of what's happening in our country today is not
[3:00:24.240 --> 3:00:31.800]  normal Donald Trump and the Maga Republicans represented extremism that
[3:00:31.800 --> 3:00:37.160]  threatens the very foundations of our Republic Biden's address of doom
[3:00:37.160 --> 3:00:42.960]  airly rattled on knowingly ignoring the criminal double standard that these was
[3:00:42.960 --> 3:00:49.280]  perched upon like a gargoyle and here in my view is what is true
[3:00:49.280 --> 3:00:54.680]  Maga Republicans do not respect the Constitution they do not believe in the
[3:00:54.680 --> 3:00:59.960]  rule of law they did not recognize the will of the people they refuse to accept
[3:00:59.960 --> 3:01:04.120]  the results of a free election he's an illegitimate president in my mind would
[3:01:04.120 --> 3:01:09.840]  you be my vice president folks look I absolutely agree from then actually
[3:01:09.840 --> 3:01:14.640]  when the election in 2016 he lost the election and he was put in the office
[3:01:14.640 --> 3:01:18.800]  because the Russians interfere Trump knows he's an illegitimate president the
[3:01:18.800 --> 3:01:22.080]  president or elect although legally elected is not legitimate I don't see
[3:01:22.080 --> 3:01:27.920]  this president in land has a legitimate president you said you believe that
[3:01:27.920 --> 3:01:32.240]  Russia's interference altered the outcome of the election I do we have a
[3:01:32.240 --> 3:01:37.400]  president who if in fact it is proven has been assisted by the Russians and may
[3:01:37.400 --> 3:01:42.520]  in fact not be a legitimate president the one thing that Trump is fearful of
[3:01:42.520 --> 3:01:47.760]  when it comes to his being president is that finally we will see how illegitimate
[3:01:47.760 --> 3:01:52.200]  his victory actually was I have an objection I object to the 15 votes from
[3:01:52.200 --> 3:01:55.760]  the state of North Carolina I object because people are horrified he's an
[3:01:55.760 --> 3:01:59.640]  illegitimate president do you believe Trump is illegitimate president what I
[3:01:59.640 --> 3:02:02.320]  believe is that there's no question that the outcome of this election was
[3:02:02.320 --> 3:02:09.640]  affected by the Russian interference and now America must choose to move
[3:02:09.640 --> 3:02:16.960]  forward or to move backwards to build a future obsessed about the past to be a
[3:02:16.960 --> 3:02:23.920]  nation of hope and unity and optimism or a nation of fear division and of
[3:02:23.920 --> 3:02:29.560]  darkness he has never done anything for not even one person I never heard
[3:02:29.560 --> 3:02:32.800]  anybody say anything about him and people want to talk about Donald Trump
[3:02:32.800 --> 3:02:35.840]  Donald Trump just Donald Trump that why is this man over there taking care of
[3:02:35.840 --> 3:02:40.880]  people at the border we hungry we need a place to stay we feel like we in a

[3:06:27.240 --> 3:06:31.320]  Biden's big dictator speech but I got to just say if you just joined us we aired
[3:06:31.320 --> 3:06:36.720]  that five-minute John Bowne report that is the best crystallization of what
[3:06:36.720 --> 3:06:42.480]  Biden did last night dark Brandon speech of doom special report at info wars.com
[3:06:42.480 --> 3:06:46.600]  and Bandai video you need to watch it you need to share it it's all up to you
[3:06:46.600 --> 3:06:52.360]  now Carlos in Canada decoding Biden's incredible speech last night what do you
[3:06:52.360 --> 3:06:55.960]  make of it you think my analysis has been on target or did I overblow it or did I
[3:06:55.960 --> 3:07:01.440]  underblow it I can't help it I'm a cognitive psychologist so when I hear
[3:07:01.440 --> 3:07:06.680]  the speech and I watched most of it I have to tell you I couldn't stop but
[3:07:06.680 --> 3:07:11.640]  analyze it I usually analyze political speeches along four lines and I'll go
[3:07:11.640 --> 3:07:19.880]  quick fear what motivates speech is it is it fear is it a question of self
[3:07:19.880 --> 3:07:24.920]  service is the person trying to talk about the greatness of his agenda
[3:07:24.920 --> 3:07:31.120]  whatever is it a question of pride or is it a question of solicitation get my
[3:07:31.120 --> 3:07:36.520]  vote or you know let's go in the case of President Trump for example there's a
[3:07:36.520 --> 3:07:42.120]  lot of pride of America and so on not very much self-service although he
[3:07:42.120 --> 3:07:45.920]  mentions his achievements of course but not in the sense of how great I am and
[3:07:45.920 --> 3:07:51.040]  rather in the context of solicitation he simply you know tries to denounce what
[3:07:51.040 --> 3:07:56.280]  he considers to be unacceptable sure his advertising his service right and he's
[3:07:56.280 --> 3:08:04.120]  not not driven by fear this speech last night was had very very little pride it
[3:08:04.120 --> 3:08:11.240]  was self-service to the point of his fear of democracy and the the election
[3:08:11.240 --> 3:08:15.120]  giving validity to his election which we know he didn't get 81 million votes
[3:08:15.120 --> 3:08:20.320]  obviously okay so somewhere along the line this this man is living in fear and
[3:08:20.320 --> 3:08:27.160]  I would like to even more consider that in the context of solicitation there
[3:08:27.160 --> 3:08:32.040]  wasn't very much and in the context of pride there was almost none from pride
[3:08:32.040 --> 3:08:38.560]  of America pride of what it is what you do find is that in the sense that the
[3:08:38.560 --> 3:08:45.000]  fear is gives rise to three things the names of the threat the people for
[3:08:45.000 --> 3:08:50.360]  instance which he calls Clinton called the pluribals later they become
[3:08:50.360 --> 3:08:55.280]  insurrectionists they then become terrorists and you would consider them
[3:08:55.280 --> 3:09:01.360]  now terrorist enemies of the state just because they are oh wait Republicans he
[3:09:01.360 --> 3:09:05.800]  says there are two of them good ones and bad ones those submit to him those that
[3:09:05.800 --> 3:09:09.560]  don't well that's what I got was weakness and fear by them trying to project
[3:09:09.560 --> 3:09:14.840]  power with troops and red backgrounds and authoritarian iconography but I took
[3:09:14.840 --> 3:09:19.840]  it as a declaration of war exactly and what happens is that as the great
[3:09:19.840 --> 3:09:25.880]  professor Desmond just mentioned they try to focus fear in the people because
[3:09:25.880 --> 3:09:31.520]  people always have fear and the professor Desmond by the way he even used
[3:09:31.520 --> 3:09:37.120]  some other my favorite quotes I mean this man is dead on he should be I think
[3:09:37.120 --> 3:09:41.040]  followed up by what if they ever have the time to have another interview with
[3:09:41.040 --> 3:09:45.240]  you one-on-one we'll take you to the second stage which is to apply it to the
[3:09:45.240 --> 3:09:49.760]  globalists okay and why what motivates them and why they're doing what they're
[3:09:49.760 --> 3:09:53.040]  doing which is well yeah we should talk about if they got full control under the
[3:09:53.040 --> 3:09:57.120]  mass formation psychosis which they get full control where would they take us if
[3:09:57.120 --> 3:10:01.080]  they got full control and what's more if it's their fear because they have a
[3:10:01.080 --> 3:10:06.440]  belief and they're protecting something very dearly to which you as an I as
[3:10:06.440 --> 3:10:11.480]  individuals in free will okay threaten them a certain their portfolio or
[3:10:11.480 --> 3:10:17.040]  threaten their status and this is what usually it drives the if you want to call
[3:10:17.040 --> 3:10:20.640]  it the drive to totalitarianist totalitarianism is the fear of
[3:10:20.640 --> 3:10:25.000]  losing status or losing well the bottom line is they've come to the end of
[3:10:25.000 --> 3:10:28.400]  their Ponzi scheme they're all about to go to prison so they cook up the
[3:10:28.400 --> 3:10:31.400]  environmental threat and make them the saviors and pose like the earth's
[3:10:31.400 --> 3:10:35.160]  collapsing because you're bad but we're gonna take over and run it for you when
[3:10:35.160 --> 3:10:39.200]  they're the bad managers to begin with I mean that's the simplest analogy and the
[3:10:39.200 --> 3:10:43.040]  fear comes from and I would love to know who wrote the speech by the way
[3:10:43.040 --> 3:10:47.880]  that's more interesting than who gave it okay who wrote this because what it
[3:10:47.880 --> 3:10:52.760]  represents is clearly that the Democratic Party has lost its agenda
[3:10:52.760 --> 3:10:57.560]  completely they started by trying to polarize whites against blacks well it
[3:10:57.560 --> 3:11:02.280]  didn't work because when president Trump said hey what did they do for doing for
[3:11:02.280 --> 3:11:06.560]  you lately well that just fell apart the second thing is that having failed with
[3:11:06.560 --> 3:11:10.040]  that they tried to put the pluribos against what they would consider
[3:11:10.040 --> 3:11:13.760]  rational but of course that didn't work either then they went to black lives
[3:11:13.760 --> 3:11:17.160]  matter and then that didn't work either they brought in this people from Latin
[3:11:17.160 --> 3:11:21.720]  America who are Christians for the most part who are people who want to make
[3:11:21.720 --> 3:11:26.320]  America great again want to live in America like the movie East and you
[3:11:26.320 --> 3:11:29.720]  know West Side Story and these individuals coming from Latin America
[3:11:29.720 --> 3:11:35.040]  they're not going to be happy about the sexual revolution or the alphabet
[3:11:35.040 --> 3:11:39.520]  they're not going to be very happy about being told to be autocrats okay
[3:11:39.520 --> 3:11:43.680]  because that's what they left behind so they are losing are all and some
[3:11:43.680 --> 3:11:47.840]  motivated by fear because they're not enough time for the next election no I
[3:11:47.840 --> 3:11:52.680]  agree so what do they do next I saw this as pre-priming things for a false
[3:11:52.680 --> 3:12:00.760]  flag I think it's time I tell you I fear that by the end of 2024 as many as four
[3:12:00.760 --> 3:12:05.840]  five past presidents of the United States will be dead one of them at least
[3:12:05.840 --> 3:12:11.560]  one assassinated and the reason why that is possible is because of of the
[3:12:11.560 --> 3:12:15.680]  discernment of history Alex we've been there you know so many times and I
[3:12:15.680 --> 3:12:20.760]  believe sincerely that the the assassination of president Trump solves
[3:12:20.760 --> 3:12:25.520]  so many problems for so many I totally agree Trump should be I mean they
[3:12:25.520 --> 3:12:29.520]  definitely want to kill him yes and blame it on Iran so then they can have a
[3:12:29.520 --> 3:12:33.320]  war and take the attention from everything because I believe with
[3:12:33.320 --> 3:12:39.200]  sincerity that you know they're not gonna have president let's say that Trump
[3:12:39.200 --> 3:12:43.840]  killed before the November obviously not but certainly if you're gonna have
[3:12:43.840 --> 3:12:50.160]  Clinton let's say run again she cannot have the baggage of president Bill
[3:12:50.160 --> 3:12:55.160]  Clinton with her because that doesn't work too much you see so in all in all
[3:12:55.160 --> 3:13:01.320]  matters the next two years are gonna have be the determinant in history for
[3:13:01.320 --> 3:13:07.560]  America either we're going to have as professor Desmet pointed out a rebirth
[3:13:07.560 --> 3:13:13.240]  and freedom to a new world to a great technologically assisted universal
[3:13:13.240 --> 3:13:18.400]  progress of entire mankind we're not talking here about one Jesus Christ
[3:13:18.400 --> 3:13:24.120]  2,000 years ago we're talking about 2,000 years after of Christianity leading
[3:13:24.120 --> 3:13:28.720]  democracy free will all this is a new birth or it could be totalitarian
[3:13:28.720 --> 3:13:33.080]  totalitarianism and the end of freedom and individual that's right we're at the
[3:13:33.080 --> 3:13:36.160]  crossroads beautifully said I gotta get to everybody six minutes of the caller
[3:13:36.160 --> 3:13:39.880]  but we got to get everybody amazing points Samuel in Oklahoma thanks for

[3:14:03.920 --> 3:14:09.760]  everything they tell you is a lie and they have a monopoly on information they
[3:14:09.760 --> 3:14:13.560]  want the true suppressed and freedom eliminated the Biden administration or
[3:14:13.560 --> 3:14:17.200]  the puppets for the new world order it's critical for people to wake up before

[3:20:28.520 --> 3:20:34.400]  listener I've been listening to you for 17 years and you know I'm very amazed of
[3:20:34.400 --> 3:20:37.640]  the job that the Lord has done in your life and the way you conduct yourself
[3:20:37.640 --> 3:20:42.240]  with the info wars I think it's time for you to take it like to another level
[3:20:42.240 --> 3:20:47.280]  like like happening to the unconscious there's I don't know I think you've had
[3:20:47.280 --> 3:20:53.080]  him before David John Oates is the guy that the he talks about reverse speech
[3:20:53.080 --> 3:20:57.760]  analysis like I just have one idea I remember when you used to have
[3:20:57.760 --> 3:21:02.200]  everybody have like a contest of a painting the face like Joker and all
[3:21:02.200 --> 3:21:06.320]  that stuff like wouldn't you have like people do a reverse speech or you have
[3:21:06.320 --> 3:21:10.960]  your crew to do a capsule you know like five a minute two minutes of a reverse
[3:21:10.960 --> 3:21:19.040]  speech analysis like this Biden last you know the last one and maybe we could
[3:21:19.040 --> 3:21:25.080]  know you know what they really thinking no I hear you but I mean Biden speech was
[3:21:25.080 --> 3:21:28.240]  very clear the American people are the enemy we're getting ready to carry out
[3:21:28.240 --> 3:21:31.600]  terror attacks we've all got to be arrested the former FBI deputy director
[3:21:31.600 --> 3:21:36.680]  basically said that so but but I mean I hear you I think I had that fell on like
[3:21:36.680 --> 3:21:41.440]  20 years ago I'm not saying it's not a real science it's just that when Claw
[3:21:41.440 --> 3:21:43.840]  Schwab says we're setting up world government we're gonna get rid of
[3:21:43.840 --> 3:21:48.240]  everybody when they're saying it forwards I can't get the public to care about it
[3:21:48.240 --> 3:21:51.920]  but you know sometimes they do listen if it's backwards it just because people
[3:21:51.920 --> 3:21:56.360]  like stuff is interesting like that so I mean maybe I should have mine yeah all
[3:21:56.360 --> 3:21:59.600]  right well thank you so much the other one was just talking about the reverse
[3:21:59.600 --> 3:22:02.960]  I mean the reverse there was reservation of rights maybe it's
[3:22:02.960 --> 3:22:07.200]  incompetent for us as citizens now so different differentiate between the
[3:22:07.200 --> 3:22:11.760]  juror jurisdiction the facto and what the armored to jurisdiction it's all
[3:22:11.760 --> 3:22:16.920]  about you know I do logistics for leaving so I have to deal with the
[3:22:16.920 --> 3:22:21.160]  steamship lines you know breaking the contract for people like you and I under
[3:22:21.160 --> 3:22:27.080]  the uniform uniform commercial code so I think it's eminent for now like Howard
[3:22:27.080 --> 3:22:31.780]  Freeman said you know like he said once he said I send you out like sheep in the
[3:22:31.780 --> 3:22:38.720]  midst of wolves be wise is serpent and harmless as a dose of Howard Freeman so
[3:22:38.720 --> 3:22:42.520]  I think it's those two things you know you tapping into their subconscious and
[3:22:42.520 --> 3:22:46.400]  exposing them in that level you know and care about the don't care about if it's
[3:22:46.400 --> 3:22:49.760]  true or not it just you know make some sense out of it because the desperate
[3:22:49.760 --> 3:22:52.920]  times call for desperate measures no I hear you brother thank you Mike thank
[3:22:52.920 --> 3:22:57.880]  you so much for calling Thomas in Texas thanks for calling go ahead hi Alex
[3:22:57.880 --> 3:23:02.480]  thanks for taking my call I think it's great to come in after that professor
[3:23:02.480 --> 3:23:06.920]  because that was kind of the point I was gonna make after that Biden speech maybe
[3:23:06.920 --> 3:23:10.560]  this has to happen this way I have I broke out of mass formation because I
[3:23:10.560 --> 3:23:14.240]  spent time in the Middle East and it woke me up ten years ago but I have so
[3:23:14.240 --> 3:23:17.800]  many family that are all connected to this beast system and they run all the
[3:23:17.800 --> 3:23:21.680]  parts of it and I think this is what it's gonna take to get people to disconnect
[3:23:21.680 --> 3:23:28.600]  to stop feeding this beast well John Podesta they just announced the pizza
[3:23:28.600 --> 3:23:33.880]  gay guy is gonna head up the office of destroying US industry known as the
[3:23:33.880 --> 3:23:39.760]  clean energy officer setting up what do you make of that oh John Podesta yes
[3:23:39.760 --> 3:23:44.480]  he's bad news everybody knows that so how that's even possible it's just more
[3:23:44.480 --> 3:23:48.040]  the same there like you said Alex they're poking us trying to get us to
[3:23:48.040 --> 3:23:51.720]  react this and they don't know what else to do to make us react so they stick
[3:23:51.720 --> 3:23:55.080]  the puppet up there tell everybody that we're all threats but we're all
[3:23:55.080 --> 3:23:59.520]  together those people are the minority and they know that so so what
[3:23:59.520 --> 3:24:05.000]  crescendo we meet is again like the professor said he said it's so great
[3:24:05.000 --> 3:24:09.000]  I'm obviously I'm nowhere near his education but he said just stick to your
[3:24:09.000 --> 3:24:12.680]  humanity and we will get through this because they are trying to make us all
[3:24:12.680 --> 3:24:17.960]  animals and so far they haven't done it with all of these prodding and poking it
[3:24:17.960 --> 3:24:20.520]  still not working to their they want to make this animals because they're
[3:24:20.520 --> 3:24:24.520]  lower than animals Thomas thank you so much Tim in Seattle you're on the air
[3:24:24.520 --> 3:24:30.800]  Tim how's it going Alex brother even I'm alright good right on well I just want
[3:24:30.800 --> 3:24:34.560]  to let you know that the narrative doesn't hold when they analyze the West
[3:24:34.560 --> 3:24:38.680]  Coast of America because I've held so many protests and rallies and I've
[3:24:38.680 --> 3:24:43.720]  confronted anti-confronted DSA and there's been no violence on our end
[3:24:43.720 --> 3:24:49.920]  whatsoever they can't it just doesn't hold up it doesn't hold at all and so I
[3:24:49.920 --> 3:24:54.160]  just want to encourage everybody to just get as loud as possible get obnoxious as
[3:24:54.160 --> 3:24:57.160]  possible but stay civil you don't want to offend people you don't want to get in
[3:24:57.160 --> 3:25:03.240]  their face but just at least broadcast as loud as possible what's going on in the
[3:25:03.240 --> 3:25:07.080]  world to the point where they're trying to label us as violent when they're the
[3:25:07.080 --> 3:25:11.280]  violent ones which shows to me they're going to stage false flags that's the
[3:25:11.280 --> 3:25:15.760]  whole narrative of the day's broadcast was the fake president was saying with
[3:25:15.760 --> 3:25:19.840]  troops in a red background the American people are our enemy and we're coming for
[3:25:19.840 --> 3:25:25.080]  you I mean it was insane they know that that's not the case just like I mean I
[3:25:25.080 --> 3:25:28.760]  guarantee you I have an FBI dossier I mean they know I'm not going to do
[3:25:28.760 --> 3:25:31.800]  anything they've known that from the get-go I used to go to in Tifa rallies
[3:25:31.800 --> 3:25:36.840]  unarmed you know I'm 5 foot 3 5 foot 4 I don't stand a chance against a
[3:25:36.840 --> 3:25:40.520]  mob I'm not afraid and that's the whole thing America you need to not be afraid
[3:25:40.520 --> 3:25:43.800]  at this moment you need to be fearless because they don't know what to do when
[3:25:43.800 --> 3:25:47.160]  you're fearless they can't reason with you you've already made up your mind
[3:25:47.160 --> 3:25:52.040]  you're fearless you have they have no control over you whatsoever so what I
[3:25:52.040 --> 3:25:56.200]  said at the Gates Foundation with my bullhorns going I'm not afraid of what
[3:25:56.200 --> 3:26:01.680]  the police the feds the FBI none of that I don't care because it's what I need to
[3:26:01.680 --> 3:26:05.080]  be doing in order to speak the truth how do people find your videos I've seen
[3:26:05.080 --> 3:26:11.320]  them they're amazing well it's really hard for me to keep the social media
[3:26:11.320 --> 3:26:16.200]  presence right now but actually there's another thing I wanted to talk about I
[3:26:16.200 --> 3:26:21.360]  could just give a couple seconds September 12th to the 13th 2022 at the
[3:26:21.360 --> 3:26:26.920]  Samaya Mu resort in Blaine Washington is the 6th annual Cascadia innovation

[3:26:58.760 --> 3:27:02.840]  fearlessness you know they can't make his violence beautiful beautiful Tim we'll
[3:27:02.840 --> 3:27:06.160]  watch that as that unfolds one more call before you're gonna break Tony in
[3:27:06.160 --> 3:27:14.800]  Illinois welcome Tony hi Alex welcome yeah I'm thinking our goal is the
[3:27:14.800 --> 3:27:22.040]  peaceful transition of power and that's also a problem so kind of in light of
[3:27:22.040 --> 3:27:27.280]  that fantastic discussion with the professor is kind of thinking of a
[3:27:27.280 --> 3:27:32.840]  framework of seeing and acting to achieve that goal and solve that problem so I
[3:27:32.840 --> 3:27:39.320]  have I broke it down into two quick arenas and with one a successful example
[3:27:39.320 --> 3:27:45.360]  so the arenas in order of importance are the spiritual contest that is for sure
[3:27:45.360 --> 3:27:49.720]  first and foremost as you and the professor pointed out and then the
[3:27:49.720 --> 3:27:55.720]  political contest and the spiritual contest is in two different parts the
[3:27:55.720 --> 3:28:02.120]  individual our individual prayer focus discipline our restraint and centeredness
[3:28:02.120 --> 3:28:08.280]  and that's critical it starts with that our connection to God and then to
[3:28:08.280 --> 3:28:14.120]  gather as a community to freely choose to build that common ground to use the
[3:28:14.120 --> 3:28:20.080]  peaceful strategy and approach now the example where this was put into place and
[3:28:20.080 --> 3:28:27.000]  then it segues into the political contest is like Germany in 1989 and
[3:28:27.000 --> 3:28:32.320]  there's a great book about that called the Berlin Journal and it was the
[3:28:32.320 --> 3:28:40.720]  transition out of Germany from the Soviet Union into away from that and it
[3:28:40.720 --> 3:28:46.040]  started out with a small prayer vigil at the light Tony don't hang up this is
[3:28:46.040 --> 3:28:47.880]  important the fall of Berlin Wall's key
[3:28:47.880 --> 3:28:50.840]  we'll finish it with Tony and take the rest of your call straight ahead please

[3:34:12.640 --> 3:34:16.000]  Tony you're raising
[3:34:16.000 --> 3:34:20.120]  maybe the crew can pull up footage of the fall of Berlin Wall how that started
[3:34:20.120 --> 3:34:25.560]  in East Germany and and how it's a model for what's gonna happen here
[3:34:25.560 --> 3:34:32.920]  here and he will fall it always does Tony yes so at the Leipzig Cathedral
[3:34:32.920 --> 3:34:40.680]  people gathered in 1989 and started out with these small vigils candlelight
[3:34:40.680 --> 3:34:47.400]  vigils and it caught on like the zeitgeist people it grew and it grew
[3:34:47.400 --> 3:34:54.880]  these candlelight vigils and then it spread to every town in city in Germany
[3:34:54.880 --> 3:35:01.560]  and that was a beautiful segue a building of this spiritual connectedness
[3:35:01.560 --> 3:35:08.000]  and people not feeling alone and having the same once in desire for a peaceful

[3:35:26.040 --> 3:35:31.440]  couldn't have been more on point and then you have the local politics and of
[3:35:31.440 --> 3:35:38.320]  course Steve Bannon do you've been talking with lately he in the Alex
[3:35:38.320 --> 3:35:42.880]  Jones fashion has just been battle-ramming out that we have to
[3:35:42.880 --> 3:35:48.440]  participate in the local party politics we have to participate in the local
[3:35:48.440 --> 3:35:54.320]  elections at the polls to be judges and poll workers and then interface with
[3:35:54.320 --> 3:35:59.440]  your elected officers and finally we have law enforcement and we have this
[3:35:59.440 --> 3:36:04.000]  incredible tradition in the United States of a peaceful transition of
[3:36:04.000 --> 3:36:08.920]  powers we have the whole systems in place and locally we have the sheriff and
[3:36:08.920 --> 3:36:14.000]  we need to work with the sheriff the constitutional sheriff and I think we'll
[3:36:14.000 --> 3:36:19.520]  be okay but they are going to try to rock our world I think you're right on I
[3:36:19.520 --> 3:36:22.720]  agree with you they're going to stage false flags I don't know how we stopped
[3:36:22.720 --> 3:36:25.240]  that but at least we can get ahead of it and warn people thanks for the call
[3:36:25.240 --> 3:36:31.040]  powerful call okay let's talk to Josh in FEMA region eight and then Hank and
[3:36:31.040 --> 3:36:40.480]  Texas who disagrees go ahead Josh Josh you there all right Josh is gone thank
[3:36:40.480 --> 3:36:43.600]  you Josh are we going to get to you quicker let's go to Hank and Texas go
[3:36:43.600 --> 3:36:51.480]  ahead Hank you're on the air hey Alex so this is a nation that honors our
[3:36:51.480 --> 3:36:54.800]  Constitution we do not reject it this is a nation that believes in the rule of
[3:36:54.800 --> 3:36:58.400]  law we do not repeat it this is a nation that respects free and their
[3:36:58.400 --> 3:37:02.680]  elections we are the will of the people we do not deny it and this is a nation
[3:37:02.680 --> 3:37:07.080]  that respects that rejects violence as a political tool we do not encourage
[3:37:07.080 --> 3:37:10.600]  violence we're still in America that believes in honesty and decency and
[3:37:10.600 --> 3:37:15.800]  respect for others patriotism liberty justice for all hope possibilities we're
[3:37:15.800 --> 3:37:20.880]  all still at our core a democracy and for a long time we've told ourselves that
[3:37:20.880 --> 3:37:25.320]  American democracy is guaranteed but it's not we have to defend it to protect
[3:37:25.320 --> 3:37:30.320]  it stand up for it each and every one of us that's that's why we're being asked
[3:37:30.320 --> 3:37:34.920]  as a nation to come together to unite behind a single purpose of defending our
[3:37:34.920 --> 3:37:40.160]  democracy regardless of your ideology ideology we're called by duty and
[3:37:40.160 --> 3:37:45.200]  conscience to confront extremists who put their own pursuit of power above all
[3:37:45.200 --> 3:37:50.480]  else we the people will not let anyone tell us apart today today there are
[3:37:50.480 --> 3:37:56.640]  dangers around us we cannot allow to prevail we hear it more and more talk
[3:37:56.640 --> 3:38:04.200]  of violence as an acceptable tool in this country hold on you read not the
[3:38:04.200 --> 3:38:08.720]  script here and that's fine but but it's the Democrats calling for violence the
[3:38:08.720 --> 3:38:11.680]  Democrats burning down cities the Democrats saying Republicans are gonna
[3:38:11.680 --> 3:38:17.800]  be violent but Republicans aren't calling for violence so so so what is your
[3:38:17.800 --> 3:38:23.040]  point here violence is cutting little boys penises off violence is letting
[3:38:23.040 --> 3:38:26.160]  child smelting across the border violence is devaluing the currency
[3:38:26.160 --> 3:38:31.120]  violence is shipping high-tech weapons to fight Russia in Ukraine violence is
[3:38:31.120 --> 3:38:35.640]  the info all the things we're witnessing so you say you disagree what do you
[3:38:35.640 --> 3:38:40.920]  disagree with because the former deputy FBI director said the Trump supporters
[3:38:40.920 --> 3:38:44.800]  are telling us we need to go after them they said the press secretary said this
[3:38:44.800 --> 3:38:50.160]  speech means questioning anything we say is bad that's authoritarian and if you
[3:38:50.160 --> 3:38:54.440]  can't look at the smart meters controlling our houses and if you can't
[3:38:54.440 --> 3:38:58.400]  look at all the draconian energy shutoffs I mean are you trying to say
[3:38:58.400 --> 3:39:04.880]  bite number one I can play you an hour of Democrats in the last three four
[3:39:04.880 --> 3:39:08.720]  elections saying Republican stole the election and I think in some cases it
[3:39:08.720 --> 3:39:11.800]  was probably true with Gore versus Bush I'm up for Gore but I think they're
[3:39:11.800 --> 3:39:16.040]  probably was stolen from Gore but but the point is is that you have a right to
[3:39:16.040 --> 3:39:21.120]  question an election it's not election denial to say I think that election was
[3:39:21.120 --> 3:39:24.360]  it fair it's why we send the State Department around the world to oversee
[3:39:24.360 --> 3:39:29.400]  other elections so are you saying it's wrong to have the right to question
[3:39:29.400 --> 3:39:34.240]  election not at all what I'm saying is I disagree with you and I'm asking you to
[3:39:34.240 --> 3:39:37.440]  get your disagreement but what about Democrats going around the country with
[3:39:37.440 --> 3:39:41.560]  30 some congressional seats and other places trying to bar people from running
[3:39:41.560 --> 3:39:46.240]  for Congress so that voters can't vote for them because they question the 2000
[3:39:46.240 --> 3:39:50.360]  election how is barring somebody from office because of their political views
[3:39:50.360 --> 3:39:54.760]  and not blocking voters from their will how is that non-election meddling how
[3:39:54.760 --> 3:39:59.720]  was hunter-bidens laptop the FBI knew was real buried and then they go to
[3:39:59.720 --> 3:40:04.200]  Facebook Twitter and Instagram and Google and say bury this story how is that
[3:40:04.200 --> 3:40:10.400]  non-election meddling is there anything in what I just said earlier what I read
[3:40:10.400 --> 3:40:13.360]  off that you said I was reading from the script did you did you hear anything
[3:40:13.360 --> 3:40:19.320]  that you disagree with I hear you reading Biden quotes out of context in the
[3:40:19.320 --> 3:40:23.520]  full context is republicans are planning a lot of context it wasn't out of
[3:40:23.520 --> 3:40:26.520]  context I read it exactly great great great great great great great the
[3:40:26.520 --> 3:40:30.100]  Democrats are all over the news saying Republicans are planning violence and
[3:40:30.100 --> 3:40:34.220]  Biden falsely claimed that repop got the clips right here that that that
[3:40:34.220 --> 3:40:39.120]  Republicans are promoting political violence who is a Republican promoting
[3:40:39.120 --> 3:40:43.480]  political violence. I'm, I'm not going to speak to that directly.
[3:40:43.480 --> 3:40:50.000]  Put him on pause. Put him on pause. Let me look at the clips here. Biden clipped in.
[3:40:50.000 --> 3:40:55.040]  Maga Republicans embrace anger. They thrive on chaos. We, the Democrats, they go out and
[3:40:55.040 --> 3:40:58.600]  confront people, burn stuff down. We just played John Bowne's report earlier. In fact,
[3:40:58.600 --> 3:41:02.360]  get John Bowne's report ready for next segment. I'm playing it again, just for Hank, so you
[3:41:02.360 --> 3:41:09.100]  can respond to it. Biden, Biden, there's no place for political violence in America period.
[3:41:09.100 --> 3:41:13.560]  We, the people, must say this is not who we are. So his idea is saying the Republicans
[3:41:13.560 --> 3:41:16.760]  are doing that. You're right there.
[3:41:16.760 --> 3:41:21.560]  Clip seven. Maga Republicans do not represent the Constitution. Really? They do not believe
[3:41:21.560 --> 3:41:27.920]  in the rule of law. Really? They promote authoritarian leaders and fan the flames of political violence.
[3:41:27.920 --> 3:41:32.000]  That's an attack on the other party, acting like it's illegal, with troops standing behind
[3:41:32.000 --> 3:41:38.120]  him at a nighttime ritual. And then I've got the White House press secretary here saying
[3:41:38.120 --> 3:41:45.040]  that if you don't agree with what the majority says, you're an extremist and a bad person.
[3:41:45.040 --> 3:41:49.760]  You know, you got a minute here, Hank. I'm going to come back and play this report just
[3:41:49.760 --> 3:41:54.120]  for you, which you're going to hate. But just go ahead.
[3:41:54.120 --> 3:42:01.360]  So I just want to say that there's one of two things going on. Either you definitely
[3:42:01.360 --> 3:42:07.000]  need to go back to high school and learn how to read and understand, or you are lying
[3:42:07.000 --> 3:42:11.520]  to your audience and you're lying to the world just so that you can make money.
[3:42:11.520 --> 3:42:17.000]  Oh, I should go get another worthless college degree and then I can be super smart. Biden
[3:42:17.000 --> 3:42:22.280]  wasn't standing there with Marines behind him saying his political enemies want violence.
[3:42:22.280 --> 3:42:26.040]  No, I said high school because you don't have to be a comprehensive level.
[3:42:26.040 --> 3:42:31.000]  But you're successful. I'm not. I understand. I appreciate your call. Always the leftist
[3:42:31.000 --> 3:42:37.880]  arrogance. Oh, Jones, you're so stupid. You don't know. Well, they're really scared folks
[3:42:37.880 --> 3:42:42.200]  there. They got their people going hard here because a lot of liberals are going away to
[3:42:42.200 --> 3:42:46.920]  do with a red background with troops. How about our political enemies want violence?
[3:42:46.920 --> 3:42:50.960]  I'm going to tell you again, this criminal government has a long history of staging
[3:42:50.960 --> 3:42:56.120]  stuff. I believe they're getting ready for false flags and I'm warning people.

[3:45:03.600 --> 3:45:08.480]  for every part of your body. But what I don't see being promoted is the fact that it has
[3:45:08.480 --> 3:45:15.920]  natural psychotropic effects. It certainly does for me. When I take a couple of these capsules
[3:45:15.920 --> 3:45:21.760]  an hour before bed, my sleep, my dreams are amazing. Now there are actually some studies
[3:45:21.760 --> 3:45:29.200]  out there linking it to amazing events in the brain. But I want you to experience it yourself.

[3:45:55.520 --> 3:46:01.840]  We are now living in the void sliding towards collapse in the strange space between what
[3:46:01.840 --> 3:46:09.360]  we've known and what's to come. And right now the most important thing to remember is don't panic.
[3:46:09.360 --> 3:46:15.680]  Stay calm because now is the time that we must get our bearings and steer the ship onto a safe
[3:46:15.680 --> 3:46:22.320]  sound course. There is nothing stopping we the people from making our own rules and building
[3:46:22.320 --> 3:46:29.360]  our own society. All we got to do is survive the crash and right now we still have time to prepare.
[3:46:29.360 --> 3:46:36.160]  The world fiat currency system is racing towards zero. It's time to convert it into hard assets
[3:46:36.160 --> 3:46:43.040]  now including food, water and survival gear to keep us strong and at the ready. Go to
[3:46:43.040 --> 3:46:51.840]  preparetoday.com for the essentials, storable foods, water filtration, first aid, power and more
[3:46:51.840 --> 3:47:03.280]  at preparetoday.com. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:47:41.920 --> 3:47:43.120]  Buddy Rose again.
[3:47:43.120 --> 3:48:10.560]  We have the official Homeland Security report put out in the last two years, put it on screen.
[3:48:10.560 --> 3:48:16.320]  Questioning elections is terror. Questioning lockdowns is terror. Questioning open borders
[3:48:16.320 --> 3:48:21.120]  is terror. We can put Fox News, NBC News, all of them up there. We have the national strategy
[3:48:21.120 --> 3:48:24.640]  countering domestic terrorism. The number one threat is the American people.
[3:48:25.520 --> 3:48:29.840]  And then the left calls in saying, oh no, Biden doesn't want that. He didn't mean any of that
[3:48:29.840 --> 3:48:34.640]  in his speech. He was outside at night with red lights on and trips behind him. That's always a
[3:48:34.640 --> 3:48:40.480]  good sign whether you're in Venezuela or Nazi Germany. Trying to gaslight us. You know, this
[3:48:40.480 --> 3:48:46.720]  John Bowne report is so powerful. I'm going to hit it and race to your calls, but it's on
[3:48:46.720 --> 3:48:50.960]  infowars.com. It's on Band Up Video. On the left, hopes this report doesn't get out. If we can put
[3:48:50.960 --> 3:48:57.040]  it back on screen, I'll give folks a headline. Dark Brandon's speech of doom. Special report. So here
[3:48:57.040 --> 3:49:08.560]  he is in his own words. Somewhere from a special place in hell, Saul Alinsky forced to watch
[3:49:08.560 --> 3:49:14.880]  C-SPAN for eternity is laughing. I suppose given a choice, I think I would pick hell.
[3:49:15.520 --> 3:49:22.080]  Revelling in Joe Biden's textbook example of a speech utilizing every rule for radicals he could
[3:49:22.080 --> 3:49:30.240]  jam in. Too much of what's happening in our country today is not normal. Donald Trump and the
[3:49:30.240 --> 3:49:37.600]  Maga Republicans represented extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic.
[3:49:38.400 --> 3:49:44.640]  Biden's address of doom arrogantly rattled on, knowingly ignoring the criminal double
[3:49:44.640 --> 3:49:51.520]  standard that the speech was perched upon like a gargoyle. And here, in my view, is what is true.
[3:49:53.120 --> 3:49:58.560]  Maga Republicans do not respect the Constitution. They do not believe in the rule of law. They
[3:49:58.560 --> 3:50:04.800]  do not recognize the will of the people. They refuse to accept the results of a free election.
[3:50:04.800 --> 3:50:09.200]  He's an illegitimate president in my mind. Would you be my vice president of the candidate of
[3:50:09.200 --> 3:50:15.280]  the president? Folks, look, I absolutely agree. Trump didn't actually win the election in 2016.
[3:50:15.280 --> 3:50:19.760]  He lost the election and he was put in the office because the Russians interfered.
[3:50:19.760 --> 3:50:24.160]  Trump knows he's an illegitimate president. The president, although legally elected,
[3:50:24.160 --> 3:50:29.760]  is not legitimate. I don't see this as president. He's like, he's a legitimate president.
[3:50:29.760 --> 3:50:34.480]  You said you believe that Russia's interference altered the outcome of the election.
[3:50:34.480 --> 3:50:40.720]  I do. We have a president who, if in fact it is proven, has been assisted by the Russians and may,
[3:50:40.720 --> 3:50:47.280]  in fact, not be a legitimate president. The one thing that Trump is fearful of when it comes
[3:50:47.280 --> 3:50:52.720]  to his being president is that finally we will see how illegitimate his victory actually was.
[3:50:52.720 --> 3:50:57.520]  I have an objection. I object to the 15 votes from the state of North Carolina. I object because
[3:50:57.520 --> 3:51:02.160]  people are horrified. He's an illegitimate president. Do you believe Trump is illegitimate
[3:51:02.160 --> 3:51:05.600]  president? What I believe is that there's no question that the outcome of this election was
[3:51:05.600 --> 3:51:14.720]  affected by the Russian interference. And now America must choose to move forward or to move
[3:51:14.720 --> 3:51:22.560]  backwards, to build a future obsessed about the past, to be a nation of hope and unity and optimism,
[3:51:23.520 --> 3:51:31.360]  or a nation of fear, division, and of darkness. He has never done anything for not even one person
[3:51:31.360 --> 3:51:35.440]  that I know of. I've never heard anybody say anything about him. And people would talk about
[3:51:35.440 --> 3:51:39.200]  Donald Trump, Donald Trump, just Donald Trump dead. Why is this man over there taking care of people
[3:51:39.200 --> 3:51:45.680]  at the border? We hungry. We need a place to stay. We feel like we in a concentration camp.
[3:51:45.680 --> 3:51:52.080]  After the country endured millions of dollars in damage and deaths due to the left's unchecked
[3:51:52.080 --> 3:51:59.200]  goading of violence. And this is a nation that rejects violence as a political tool.
[3:51:59.200 --> 3:52:04.480]  We do not encourage violence. I just don't even know why the far up right all of the country
[3:52:04.480 --> 3:52:08.480]  may be there will be. There needs to be unrest in the streets for as long as there is unrest in our
[3:52:08.480 --> 3:52:13.200]  lives. We've got to be ready to throw a punch. We have to be ready to throw a punch. Donald Trump,
[3:52:13.200 --> 3:52:17.120]  I think you need to go back and punch him in the face. That I thought he should have punched him
[3:52:17.120 --> 3:52:21.760]  in the face. I feel like punching him. I'd like to take him behind the gym if I were in high school.
[3:52:21.760 --> 3:52:25.920]  If I were in high school, I'd take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him. Please get
[3:52:25.920 --> 3:52:32.960]  up in the face of some Congress people. People will do what they do. I want to tell you, Gorsuch,
[3:52:32.960 --> 3:52:40.800]  I want to tell you, Gavin Orr, you have released the whirlwind and you will pay the price.
[3:52:40.800 --> 3:52:50.160]  Just a warning to you, Trumpers, be careful. Walk lightly. And for those of you who are soldiers,
[3:52:50.800 --> 3:52:54.800]  make them pay. If you had to be stuck in an elevator with either President Trump,
[3:52:54.800 --> 3:52:58.560]  Mike Pence, or Jeff Sessions, who would it be? Does one of us have to come out alive?
[3:53:00.960 --> 3:53:07.680]  Maga Republic has made their choice. They embrace anger. They thrive on chaos.
[3:53:08.720 --> 3:53:14.400]  They live not in the light of truth, but in the shadow of lies. How many times have you ever
[3:53:14.400 --> 3:53:19.040]  spoken to your son about his overseas business dealings? I've never spoken to my son about
[3:53:19.040 --> 3:53:22.720]  his overseas business dealings. I said, you're not getting the billion. I'm going to be leaving
[3:53:22.720 --> 3:53:26.320]  here. I think it was about six hours. I looked, I said, I'm leaving in six hours.
[3:53:26.320 --> 3:53:30.400]  If the prosecutor's not fired, you're not getting the money. Oh, son of a bitch.
[3:53:31.840 --> 3:53:38.320]  Got fired. And as the senile placeholder for globalism will slowly help the way by his racist
[3:53:38.320 --> 3:53:45.600]  first lady, most Americans knew Joe Biden's speech would go down as one of, if not the darkest
[3:53:45.600 --> 3:53:53.840]  speech in American history by a sitting president of the United States, John Bowne reported. Oh,
[3:53:53.840 --> 3:53:58.720]  no, the Democrats aren't, aren't setting anything up. They're so nice. It's so sweet. We heard those
[3:53:58.720 --> 3:54:04.240]  seminar callers called in and told us so Leo and Minnesota says you're a proud boy on the
[3:54:04.240 --> 3:54:12.400]  false flags coming. Go ahead. Alex Biden is totally setting the groundwork for the globalist
[3:54:12.400 --> 3:54:18.960]  destruction of the West and America. Trump has came out and now every conservative is on a list
[3:54:18.960 --> 3:54:23.680]  because of their support for Trump. Like I said, I'm a proud boy, so I supported Trump,
[3:54:23.680 --> 3:54:27.760]  but now I don't put it past them that he's not controlled opposition because he's not doing
[3:54:27.760 --> 3:54:32.800]  nothing now in a moment. The goal is to collapse the West. And once they collapse the West,
[3:54:32.800 --> 3:54:37.760]  then they can usher in a one world order. They can depopulate the planet. They can merge with
[3:54:37.760 --> 3:54:42.720]  machines and they can transcend into their next wave of humanity. And that's what the globalist
[3:54:42.720 --> 3:54:47.040]  ultimate agenda is. And we know what their ultimate agenda is because they admit it.
[3:54:47.040 --> 3:54:51.840]  It's in all their white papers, Alex, but you want to know what I got? I got the key to it all.
[3:54:52.480 --> 3:54:56.720]  And it's the Essenes, the Nazarenes, and their ancient teachings of ascension.
[3:54:58.000 --> 3:55:04.720]  If we can follow their goal of expanded consciousness beyond ordinary perception
[3:55:04.720 --> 3:55:11.760]  to see beyond the veil, it will enable us access to divine realms. And this mystical path is mapped
[3:55:11.760 --> 3:55:17.040]  out and feasible. It's the Gnostic text, which we're hidden away from humanity. But now it's all
[3:55:17.040 --> 3:55:23.520]  here, Alex. And I think that's what the professor was talking about last hour. Exactly, exactly.
[3:55:23.520 --> 3:55:29.360]  But you see, we can't resort to violence. We can't meet their violence with violence because then
[3:55:29.360 --> 3:55:36.080]  we lose. The ultimate goal of ascension is to transcend violence, you know, to be at one with
[3:55:36.080 --> 3:55:44.080]  the universe, to be at one with the cosmos. But they're getting an off-world message from something
[3:55:44.080 --> 3:55:48.960]  I don't know if it's more spiritual or if it's more alien. But what it is, it's a dark message
[3:55:48.960 --> 3:55:54.400]  telling them to kill off humanity. And if they follow that, we're going to go through this
[3:55:54.400 --> 3:56:00.160]  regardless. This is just our test that the cosmos and God is putting us through. We will make it
[3:56:00.160 --> 3:56:06.080]  past this. Right now, we're a level zero, but we will transcend to a level one, two, and three
[3:56:06.080 --> 3:56:11.200]  type civilization, and we will merge with the stars. We will have life extension technology.
[3:56:11.200 --> 3:56:16.400]  We just have to see it through. We have to remain peaceful. We have to live in a way of
[3:56:16.400 --> 3:56:22.800]  Martin Luther King and all of the great founding fathers of this country. And we have to go
[3:56:22.800 --> 3:56:26.560]  through. You're a beautiful caller. You're beautiful. What you're saying is totally true,
[3:56:26.560 --> 3:56:31.760]  and I love you. I love you, brother. All right. I'm sorry to Lee and old dude and AJ and Joan
[3:56:31.760 --> 3:56:36.400]  and Mike. We're out of time. We did four hours. Got to end it. Try to get to everybody. If you
[3:56:36.400 --> 3:56:39.600]  want to get their names and numbers, John, when I do the show tomorrow, even though it's taped,
[3:56:39.600 --> 3:56:44.960]  we'll call these callers, these five callers at, you know, I'm up here at nine to an interview,
[3:56:44.960 --> 3:56:48.720]  and then like at 11, we're doing tape interviews. We call these callers at like noon or something
[3:56:48.720 --> 3:56:53.920]  in the mugs. I really respect them. I appreciate them. And just because the Democrat seminar
[3:56:53.920 --> 3:56:57.600]  callers called in, because I don't care as many discrees, but I can tell when it's staged. Okay.
[3:56:57.600 --> 3:57:02.400]  Just because you called in, I had a goal not to plug today. But I need to be funded. We need to
[3:57:02.400 --> 3:57:07.040]  stay on air. InfowarsTour.com, vitamin mineral fusions selling out 40% off DNA Force Plus,

[3:57:39.600 --> 3:57:43.440]  all our guests and all our callers. I love you all. We will transcend God bless.
[3:57:43.440 --> 3:57:50.240]  People say Alex Jones crazy. He's a conspiracy theory guy. He's a nutcase. He got these rants
[3:57:50.240 --> 3:57:57.760]  and all that. What they miss is that this guy's ahead of the curve on so many different topics
[3:57:58.320 --> 3:58:05.920]  of signal, not noise. If you look at the signal and you compare that to PBS and NPR and BBC and
[3:58:05.920 --> 3:58:10.960]  we'll do what Alex Jones put out there versus what your collective body has put out there.
[3:58:10.960 --> 3:58:14.400]  And if you're a set in a human being and just watching it, you say, well,
[3:58:14.400 --> 3:58:17.520]  God, Alex Jones is the head of this. Not only that, he kind of explained it.
[3:58:17.520 --> 3:58:22.480]  You are one of the great thinkers of this. That is very rare. You've got to go back almost to
[3:58:22.480 --> 3:58:27.680]  the revolutionary generation and see that in this new book. I got to tell you when Tony
[3:58:27.680 --> 3:58:32.800]  Lyons first approached me, I read this thing. I go, this is it. This is no Beatry. You're not
[3:58:32.800 --> 3:58:35.920]  going to be flipping pages or you're going to be having a pin out and you're going to be underlining
[3:58:35.920 --> 3:58:52.640]  stuff. There is nothing, there is no more epitome of free speech than right here. And that's what
[3:58:52.640 --> 3:58:58.000]  people recognize and resonate with. And as Ward said, you're not going to find a better place
[3:58:58.000 --> 3:59:01.680]  for information. You might not agree with everything. You might not agree with all our
[3:59:01.680 --> 3:59:06.400]  perspectives, but we cover all the information. And there's nowhere else really that does it
[3:59:06.400 --> 3:59:11.440]  like we do here. Thank you for that Ward infowarstore.com. By the way, the products he mentions
[3:59:11.440 --> 3:59:15.600]  infowarstore.com is where to get them folks. And we do have the best supplements. I mean,
[3:59:15.600 --> 3:59:19.360]  just like we try our best with our news coverage and our information,
[3:59:20.400 --> 3:59:26.240]  we do the best with our supplements as well. I mean, look at the hair and beard support formula.
[3:59:26.240 --> 3:59:31.040]  Folks, this is a joke. I mean, we're giving this thing away at 75% off. By the way,
[3:59:31.040 --> 3:59:37.120]  it works for me. In case you haven't noticed, the hair and beard formula is working for me.
[3:59:37.120 --> 3:59:43.200]  Quite well, I might add. Quite well, my barber appreciates hair and beard support for men.
[3:59:43.200 --> 3:59:51.280]  I go and see him quite often now. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[3:59:51.280 --> 4:00:04.080]  it's Alex Jones.
