[01:00.000 --> 01:04.080]  next week with one of the leading experts I've done deep research for over a
[01:04.080 --> 01:08.440]  decade on mortgage fraud one of the leading experts on the fraud we're not
[01:08.440 --> 01:11.520]  gonna talk about the remedies because that's that's even more complex we'll

[01:16.920 --> 01:22.920]  different forms of corruption and scams that they're running today because

[01:49.440 --> 01:55.920]  racing under G20 control to lower their currencies the massive inflation has
[01:55.920 --> 02:01.320]  been kicked off now Ron Paul gave a powerful speech that's in Paul Watson's
[02:01.320 --> 02:06.600]  article at prisonplanet.com dollar collapse will spur 2012 presidential
[02:06.600 --> 02:13.280]  run and Paul Smart he's saying if things go ahead and collapse now I may be able
[02:13.280 --> 02:17.160]  to win because I've warned everybody about this for 30 years but he said if
[02:17.160 --> 02:21.320]  the crisis comes later I probably won't win it doesn't matter he's gonna run
[02:21.320 --> 02:24.400]  because he'll be able to inject real issues into the debate I can tell you
[02:24.400 --> 02:29.600]  right now he he hadn't told me this but Ron Paul is gonna run I'm just gonna
[02:29.600 --> 02:34.360]  leave it at that for you barring health issues and Rand is probably gonna win

[02:52.040 --> 02:55.000]  with us later in the middle of the next hour but I wanted to briefly bring
[02:55.000 --> 02:59.080]  Ted Anderson in because people don't want to wait you know gold continues to go
[02:59.080 --> 03:03.120]  up he's about to run out of the golden silver he bought when silver was at 22
[03:03.120 --> 03:12.800]  and gold was at around 1,345 it's now gone over 1,370 plus today he is gonna
[03:12.800 --> 03:17.080]  run out of this so very briefly Ted I just wanted to pitch Midas resources
[03:17.080 --> 03:20.440]  because these deals are so good and it'll be a good deal when you're selling
[03:20.440 --> 03:26.000]  gold at $1,370 an ounce when it's 1,400 you know just like it was a good deal
[03:26.000 --> 03:32.040]  when gold was 500 an ounce and you know you were selling it for 450 but people
[03:32.040 --> 03:35.040]  didn't take action right now you got a minute and a half tell folks today's
[03:35.040 --> 03:40.080]  offers that are about to end well yeah Frank's currently a 289 British

[07:15.640 --> 07:19.840]  president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's
[07:19.840 --> 07:25.080]  incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for the
[07:25.080 --> 07:29.640]  Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[07:29.640 --> 07:34.040]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world

[07:59.880 --> 08:08.040]  ease the T-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network we are
[08:08.040 --> 08:13.200]  live it is Wednesday the 13th day of October 2010 you have founded the tip
[08:13.200 --> 08:17.480]  of the spear the front lines in the info war against tyranny enslavement and
[08:17.480 --> 08:22.560]  dehumanization as Thomas Jefferson said I have sworn on the altar of God
[08:22.560 --> 08:27.960]  eternal resistance over every form of tyranny over the mind of men and for the
[08:27.960 --> 08:35.080]  next hour we are joined by general hamed ghoul three-star general known for
[08:35.080 --> 08:39.600]  heading the inner service intelligence pakistanis intelligence agency and
[08:39.600 --> 08:44.960]  defeating the soviet bear he also fought in combat in multiple wars and was a
[08:44.960 --> 08:50.760]  field commander his bio is about 15 pages long so we won't go over all of it
[08:50.760 --> 08:56.240]  but definitely a fighting general and the old-fashioned sense of the word and I
[08:56.240 --> 08:59.560]  wanted to get him on because everything he talked about a month ago when he was
[08:59.560 --> 09:05.120]  on is now unfolding exactly as he said it would clearly there the globalist
[09:05.120 --> 09:11.440]  using us forces are bombing all over pakistan innocent people in an attempt
[09:11.440 --> 09:17.520]  to enrage the tribal regions into fomening insurrection so they have a
[09:17.520 --> 09:22.120]  pretext to launch a full-scale war it is order out of chaos but I don't think
[09:22.120 --> 09:26.120]  they're gonna get any order out of this chaos militants set NATO fuel trucks
[09:26.120 --> 09:30.160]  ablaze in pakistan you know about that literally hundreds of trucks blown up in
[09:30.160 --> 09:35.000]  the last two weeks pakistan governments accuses the white house of exaggerating
[09:35.000 --> 09:38.560]  al-qaeda terror threat ahead of elections the white house is admitted
[09:38.560 --> 09:41.720]  they're basically doing that drone strikes in pakistan could backfire in the
[09:41.720 --> 09:46.040]  long term pakistan closing the border with afghanistan that key supply route
[09:46.040 --> 09:50.680]  over the fact that pakistani soldiers are being targeted I mean if the CIA drone
[09:50.680 --> 09:55.640]  controllers can't see men in uniforms and tanks and armored vehicles and know
[09:55.640 --> 10:02.000]  that that's not a Pashtun or tribal groups they need to have their heads
[10:02.000 --> 10:06.760]  examined they're clearly doing this on purpose also pakistan criticizes
[10:06.760 --> 10:11.720]  unjustified u.s. drone strikes and it just continues or bombing weddings
[10:11.720 --> 10:16.840]  children by riversides it's just it's just pure evil pakistan you and ambassadors
[10:16.840 --> 10:24.240]  as afghan war unwinnable and so general hameed ghoul joins us to talk about all
[10:24.240 --> 10:28.680]  of this and what's happening a general thank you for coming on with us
[10:28.680 --> 10:31.960]  well elix thank you very much for taking me
[10:31.960 --> 10:36.040]  where do we start i mean you were on a month ago or just five weeks ago with
[10:36.040 --> 10:40.440]  us and everything you talked about how this was about to really get past the
[10:40.440 --> 10:45.640]  point of our return is is we're now racing towards that point please break
[10:45.640 --> 10:48.120]  down the basics for us
[10:48.120 --> 10:51.920]  actually there have been enormous military mistakes I won't say that
[10:51.920 --> 10:56.120]  bush of course you you can pick holes in him and everybody's picking holes in
[10:56.120 --> 11:02.960]  him his policy that was a failure absolutely put America on the mat
[11:02.960 --> 11:08.280]  quite unnecessarily and the turn the world upside down all because of a pack
[11:08.280 --> 11:15.680]  of flies that he and his administration was indulging in at that time but let's
[11:15.680 --> 11:22.280]  talk specifically about the military failures in Afghanistan now that is
[11:22.280 --> 11:27.240]  where I would suggest that the Congress should set up an inquiry committee to
[11:27.240 --> 11:32.200]  look into these failures these have been very basic and very elementary
[11:32.200 --> 11:38.440]  coalitions of the principles of war of the principles of combat and how to go
[11:38.440 --> 11:44.000]  about approaching a war we I went as a young officer I read a book called
[11:44.000 --> 11:49.560]  approach to battle now that is approach to battle is very important and in this
[11:49.560 --> 11:53.840]  there are two things which have to be taken into account one is of course the
[11:53.840 --> 11:58.760]  selection and ventures of aim and mission in this case the mission was
[11:58.760 --> 12:04.800]  totally lopsided that is why it has to be altered you see it was initially to
[12:04.800 --> 12:09.680]  disperse the Al Qaeda and to arrest Osama bin Laden and and some of his
[12:09.680 --> 12:15.880]  accomplices but now the mission is as you can see President Obama has already
[12:15.880 --> 12:22.080]  announced that it is to reverse the momentum of Taliban now how has this
[12:22.080 --> 12:27.160]  mission quite even changed because if you violate the first principle of war
[12:27.160 --> 12:33.280]  that is selection and maintenance of the aim then you are doomed to failure in
[12:33.280 --> 12:37.600]  any case because you are not pursuing the mission that you had selected
[12:37.600 --> 12:41.640]  initially and that means that mission was wrong either that mission was wrong
[12:41.640 --> 12:45.800]  or your contact of the mission is wrong well we know that mission was staged we
[12:45.800 --> 12:53.880]  know that it was basically just blamed all the evidence shows on Afghanistan and
[12:53.880 --> 12:57.680]  Pakistan it was clearly an inside job so it's a fraud from the beginning so the
[12:57.680 --> 13:02.680]  real names are narcotics money controlling oil pipelines menacing China
[13:02.680 --> 13:07.000]  and Pakistan as a bigger brzezinski wrote in the grand chessboard as the
[13:07.000 --> 13:12.560]  Israeli plan stated in 84 I mean this is all part of a larger strategy to drive a
[13:12.560 --> 13:18.880]  wedge right through Eastern and Europe right through the Middle East into
[13:18.880 --> 13:23.120]  Central Asia and I mean that's what's happening here is they're trying to
[13:23.120 --> 13:27.080]  drive a wedge straight through and then they have cover stories for why they're
[13:27.080 --> 13:33.440]  putting all these military forces in I am particularly addressing the military
[13:33.440 --> 13:39.960]  audience of the veterans in America who would understand and the soldiers in
[13:39.960 --> 13:46.560]  uniform the airmen and the sailors that there has to be single mission if you go
[13:46.560 --> 13:50.840]  for multiple missions like you have yourself described very rightly keep
[13:50.840 --> 13:57.360]  China out to have the pipeline to export the Kaspian Sea basin area oil reserves
[13:57.360 --> 14:03.800]  and and more than everything else to give a wider field of protection to the
[14:03.800 --> 14:09.560]  state of Israel so actually America was not pursuing its own national objectives
[14:09.560 --> 14:14.520]  in Afghanistan it was somebody else's objective corporate America had its own
[14:14.520 --> 14:20.840]  acts to grind and as you said the drug barons and the American drug traders
[14:20.840 --> 14:27.160]  that paddlers they had their own interest to vested interest and but this is not how
[14:27.160 --> 14:31.080]  the wars have conducted the point that I'm trying to make is that the mission
[14:31.080 --> 14:36.840]  ab initio was absolutely wrong it was not cited mission but then once you had
[14:36.840 --> 14:41.760]  selected this mission rightly or wrongly then you should have looked at it what
[14:41.760 --> 14:47.600]  are the lines of supply war is described as nothing but the game of lines of
[14:47.600 --> 14:52.480]  communication that your supply lines are kept intact and they are safe and
[14:52.480 --> 14:59.960]  secure in friendly hands there is Pakistan who decided under Doris to go
[14:59.960 --> 15:05.120]  along and because it was being run by a dictator at that time and that dictator
[15:05.120 --> 15:09.680]  was also installed with as a preparation to what they were planning to do
[15:09.680 --> 15:14.040]  otherwise there was a perfect democracy which was functioning on the 12th of
[15:14.040 --> 15:22.720]  October it just passed one day ago in 1999 I actually encouraged to step
[15:22.720 --> 15:29.520]  into the office of president and a dictator and therefore they were making
[15:29.520 --> 15:36.880]  preparations for 9-11 long before actually the event took place so here is
[15:36.880 --> 15:43.000]  Pakistan which is naturally very very concerned about its own security interest
[15:43.000 --> 15:48.800]  but you are asking under Doris for Pakistan to give you the supply lines
[15:48.800 --> 15:52.920]  which it did and today what is happening to those supply lines you mentioned
[15:52.920 --> 15:59.200]  about the trucks being blown up and you mentioned about Pakistan finally at one
[15:59.200 --> 16:04.320]  point saying that no more and you have got to stop this nonsense that you are
[16:04.320 --> 16:10.840]  killing our soldier you are violating the UN charter this was not mandated by
[16:10.840 --> 16:15.360]  the United Nations and you are coming inside Pakistan as if drone attacks are
[16:15.360 --> 16:20.320]  not bad enough you have to come and kill Pakistani soldiers who are your
[16:20.320 --> 16:27.160]  frontline allies so obviously the very first test where Pakistan acted in
[16:27.160 --> 16:33.040]  defiance of the dictates which were being thrust upon Pakistan the
[16:33.040 --> 16:37.800]  Americans had to back down and they had to apologize now that means the lines of
[16:37.800 --> 16:43.800]  communication are extremely vulnerable not only that America cannot win
[16:43.800 --> 16:50.920]  without the line of communication being secured they can't even quit the
[16:50.920 --> 16:54.880]  Pakistan that's the tragedy we're not looking at the present situation which
[16:54.880 --> 16:59.360]  is quite bad which is very very messy from the military point of view but
[16:59.360 --> 17:03.000]  America can't even withdraw out of Afghanistan if these lines of
[17:03.000 --> 17:07.080]  communication are not secure that's right the Afghans let the Russians leave
[17:07.080 --> 17:12.240]  with their tail between their legs in Vietnam in the mid 70s we saw the images
[17:12.240 --> 17:17.480]  of people hanging off the skids of helicopters this is such a remote and
[17:17.480 --> 17:24.560]  isolated area that they don't even have the fuel or the transports to get our
[17:24.560 --> 17:32.280]  forces out unless the Afghans let them yes exactly they are using at this
[17:32.280 --> 17:38.400]  moment to pay 100,000 gallons of fuel every day and that is passing through
[17:38.400 --> 17:42.800]  Pakistan if Pakistan becomes hostile and Pakistan government doesn't have to
[17:42.800 --> 17:47.440]  become hostile Pakistan people will become hostile they already are hostile
[17:47.440 --> 17:53.680]  and I think 80% of Pakistani according to some survey hate America because of
[17:53.680 --> 17:58.320]  the excesses that America is in Dalton besides let me tell you this is a very
[17:58.320 --> 18:05.280]  subtle and a fine point the Americans not only destabilized Pakistan but they
[18:05.280 --> 18:10.640]  allowed India to carry out the destabilization act along with America's
[18:10.640 --> 18:17.800]  support so really you were cutting the Americans were cutting the branch on
[18:17.800 --> 18:22.680]  which they were nesting so I don't know why was this self-destructive policy
[18:22.680 --> 18:28.280]  adopted in the beginning so well it's a policy of total treachery I mean it's
[18:28.280 --> 18:32.760]  now come out that they have stolen the death benefits of six million dead and
[18:32.760 --> 18:36.680]  dying veterans from World War two through today and they just put it in the
[18:36.680 --> 18:39.800]  newspaper and say the government made a deal with the insurance companies to
[18:39.800 --> 18:45.840]  steal the vets money I mean this is a group of pure evil yes of course it is
[18:45.840 --> 18:51.560]  really discredited America to but unfortunately America is so powerful at
[18:51.560 --> 18:57.320]  this moment and slowly that power is eroding morally economically they have
[18:57.320 --> 19:03.200]  spent this by the end of the year America will have spent about a trillion
[19:03.200 --> 19:08.600]  dollars in Afghanistan alone which is a hell of a lot of money to be spent on a
[19:08.600 --> 19:14.480]  deflate place like Afghanistan so why is that taxpayer money being spent with
[19:14.480 --> 19:19.720]  such impurity give alone Iraq and other places but this is an enormous amount of
[19:19.720 --> 19:25.120]  money which they have spent here and on top of that there is the drug trafficking
[19:25.120 --> 19:30.800]  which is going on six thousand two hundred tons of opium which caters to
[19:30.800 --> 19:35.440]  nearly 92% of world's requirement proposed grown in Afghanistan last year
[19:35.440 --> 19:41.480]  and NATO and ISAF and American forces are all there it is happening right under
[19:41.480 --> 19:45.920]  their own but more than that it is happening with their connivance the
[19:45.920 --> 19:50.720]  warlords are there the drug barrels are there and they're all being protected
[19:50.720 --> 19:55.520]  in courage and they are part of the government in Afghanistan but this
[19:55.520 --> 19:59.800]  governance the people of Afghanistan I'm not happy about now that's right when
[19:59.800 --> 20:04.000]  the people of Afghanistan ran things 10 years ago they halted almost all opium
[20:04.000 --> 20:08.840]  production and now they put it on Fox News that it shows a Marine Corps Colonel
[20:08.840 --> 20:14.560]  admitting they're giving the Afghans the fertilizer to grow the opium that's how
[20:14.560 --> 20:20.200]  out in the open and now you have a record opium flooding out of the region
[20:20.200 --> 20:25.000]  the Russians are complaining they have tens of thousands dying from this pure
[20:25.000 --> 20:30.120]  heroin being shipped into their country it's General Hamid Ghul it's like the
[20:30.120 --> 20:37.640]  Twilight Zone this is so bizarre until you read the highest level strategies of
[20:37.640 --> 20:43.040]  the New World Order crowd and much of its public their master plan is to
[20:43.040 --> 20:48.440]  destroy every nation India Pakistan everyone the United States they're
[20:48.440 --> 20:53.280]  sucking the US dry destroying our name while they pump trillions of dollars
[20:53.280 --> 20:58.200]  into these war black holes it's all about destroying the nation states
[20:58.200 --> 21:02.640]  transferring all power to the global private central banks now openly
[21:02.640 --> 21:08.120]  announcing world government as they globally devalue currencies in concert
[21:08.120 --> 21:13.520]  I mean this is a master plan and it's designed in the end to bring the
[21:13.520 --> 21:17.000]  republic down and I want the great people of Pakistan to know this and I
[21:17.000 --> 21:20.360]  know you're sophisticated people okay some of the most sophisticated out there
[21:20.360 --> 21:26.560]  for my research understand the United States has a zombie drug doubt television
[21:26.560 --> 21:30.560]  head mind-controlled populations some of them are trying to wake up we're
[21:30.560 --> 21:34.880]  trying to break their trance right now general but understand we are in even
[21:34.880 --> 21:39.280]  deeper trouble than you okay we are literally under a high-tech
[21:39.280 --> 21:46.080]  technocracy sir and and and so we're all in this together yes of course Alex I
[21:46.080 --> 21:50.760]  think you are a dead right but I would rather focus directly on the military
[21:50.760 --> 21:54.120]  failures in Afghanistan yes sir let's do that in fact what you are saying is
[21:54.120 --> 21:58.240]  absolutely right and eventually going to land America in deep trouble maybe
[21:58.240 --> 22:03.360]  fragment America to pieces politically because after all how long can such
[22:03.360 --> 22:07.440]  mistakes be tolerated and how long can people keep on suffering people of
[22:07.440 --> 22:12.240]  America one day it is going to come to roost and that is where the people of
[22:12.240 --> 22:16.840]  America will be shocked and angered and this is going to create a lot of
[22:16.840 --> 22:21.640]  problem maybe there is yet another civil war inside America but those are
[22:21.640 --> 22:27.200]  rather stretching the imagination although not logically but I would focus
[22:27.200 --> 22:32.720]  purely on the military at the moment because that okay I agree with you
[22:32.720 --> 22:36.520]  because you're the preeminent expert on this general hameed ghoul the man who
[22:36.520 --> 22:40.160]  the mainstream media lies about and claims as the commander of al Qaeda
[22:40.160 --> 22:45.080]  worldwide I mean it might as well be the Easter Bunny it's just totally made up
[22:45.080 --> 22:49.480]  they've got private contractors over there staging terror attacks to blame it
[22:49.480 --> 22:54.080]  on the Afghans and others that's come out it's come out the attacks in India in
[22:54.080 --> 23:00.200]  Mumbai were staged by the CIA that's now mainstream news so so I'm gonna give you
[23:00.200 --> 23:03.320]  the floor then we're going to break it about eight minutes there's so much
[23:03.320 --> 23:08.600]  happening a month ago you told us what was about to happen in Pakistan it's
[23:08.600 --> 23:14.320]  now happening clearly Obama is not going to change course he's a puppet so tell
[23:14.320 --> 23:20.040]  us a the failures in in in simple blow-by-blow point-by-point and then tell
[23:20.040 --> 23:26.120]  us if they don't change course what use forecast happening general hameed ghoul
[23:26.120 --> 23:32.160]  well I think we have a thing in the military that the mistakes that have
[23:32.160 --> 23:37.480]  been made in the assembly of forces and in selection of the aim they cannot be
[23:37.480 --> 23:43.600]  rectified to the conduct of battle so I think the mistakes cannot be put right
[23:43.600 --> 23:48.960]  now you cannot win therefore you have to accept that you have lost and now you
[23:48.960 --> 23:54.040]  have to cut your losses you have got to reorganize yourself reorganize the
[23:54.040 --> 23:59.320]  American society reorganize your economic institutions financial
[23:59.320 --> 24:05.480]  institutions you've got to act in accordance with the wishes of your
[24:05.480 --> 24:09.600]  own people in accordance with the interest of your own people I'm not
[24:09.600 --> 24:13.240]  saying that you act in accordance with the wishes of Pakistani people please
[24:13.240 --> 24:18.080]  don't if you don't want to although we have been your very staunch ally but
[24:18.080 --> 24:24.800]  please be kind to your own people you are be fooling them you are cutting across
[24:24.800 --> 24:30.600]  their interest and there is no way so the first thing that you have to do is you
[24:30.600 --> 24:36.000]  have to accept your mistakes you have to accept people like me who are telling
[24:36.000 --> 24:40.360]  you for heaven's sake you have made mistakes and now it is time to rectify
[24:40.360 --> 24:44.960]  those mistakes I told you one is about the line of communication which is so
[24:44.960 --> 24:49.440]  important nobody can win the war without their line of communication and you
[24:49.440 --> 24:54.720]  were so right in pointing out that they ran out of Vietnam they cut and ran
[24:54.720 --> 25:00.480]  because the line of communication was very short they were in the Gulf of
[25:00.480 --> 25:05.960]  Tonkin the aircraft were aircraft carriers were waiting there the other ships
[25:05.960 --> 25:11.120]  were there so it was very easy for you to run out there hanging by the skids of
[25:11.120 --> 25:15.400]  the helicopters but this is not going to be possible as far as Afghanistan is
[25:15.400 --> 25:19.200]  concerned how much are you going to retrieve when you run out in a haste
[25:19.200 --> 25:24.560]  it is not possible already the world is gone and the Taliban ranks are drawing
[25:24.560 --> 25:30.360]  a lot of recruits a lot of motivated young man because they are like the old
[25:30.360 --> 25:35.800]  war war horse they are snorting for victory they are sensing smelling victory
[25:35.800 --> 25:42.160]  in front of them and that will not be too far so really this is one is the line
[25:42.160 --> 25:46.800]  of communication the other is failure of intelligence there has been such a huge
[25:46.800 --> 25:51.120]  lot of failure of intelligence and I've been an intelligence expert all my life
[25:51.120 --> 25:56.880]  I know that there have been such enormous mistakes on and you engaged for
[25:56.880 --> 26:02.080]  security for intelligence gathering you engage private contractors the old
[26:02.080 --> 26:09.080]  fogies from the CIA and from the FBI you engage them the tired burnt out fatigued
[26:09.080 --> 26:14.120]  exhausted individual because you they were the croonies and these crooning
[26:14.120 --> 26:18.400]  contractors played havoc with intelligence gathering and dissemination
[26:18.400 --> 26:24.320]  they couldn't have analyzed anything they were 92,000 reports lying with the
[26:24.320 --> 26:30.520]  Pentagon for over six years and these are not even analyzed can you imagine
[26:30.520 --> 26:36.800]  general general isn't it isn't it worse I mean so really the CIA and the
[26:36.800 --> 26:40.000]  government are blind because they've hired a bunch of crooks to do their
[26:40.000 --> 26:43.840]  intelligence gathering but it's worse than being blind in war isn't it better
[26:43.840 --> 26:50.160]  to be blind than to be fed a total delusion I mean you see the point I'm
[26:50.160 --> 26:55.160]  making they're not just getting you know info they're getting a line of bull and
[26:55.160 --> 27:00.360]  so the system is delusional it's believing its own lies exactly this is
[27:00.360 --> 27:04.000]  called paper milling in the military parlance it is known as paper milling
[27:04.000 --> 27:09.040]  you put out reports which you think that the authorities are going to believe
[27:09.040 --> 27:13.560]  and who are the authorities they are your own buddies from the past you work
[27:13.560 --> 27:18.240]  together and it is all being done for dollars so they have been they have to
[27:18.240 --> 27:23.080]  be charged for cheating the nation and I would so much strongly recommend that
[27:23.080 --> 27:27.320]  the Congress should set up an inquiry commission into their conduct and you
[27:27.320 --> 27:32.440]  go around the world and see all the waterfront properties who have who has
[27:32.440 --> 27:37.680]  a mask those waterfront properties and you will find out there would be some
[27:37.680 --> 27:45.360]  general hand or some somebody from the CIA somebody from the FBI so there has to
[27:45.360 --> 27:49.200]  be some investigative journalists have got to get down to the task of finding
[27:49.200 --> 27:55.280]  out who has been since 9-11 amassing a lot of property wealth and Swiss bank
[27:55.280 --> 27:58.960]  accounts and all this has got to be pro well general it's now coming out in
[27:58.960 --> 28:03.640]  federal court that blackwater have reportedly men running around naked
[28:03.640 --> 28:08.080]  piles of cocaine the Iraqis had always said this that they would just go out
[28:08.080 --> 28:12.240]  at night and machine gun people in their cars families and their houses for fun
[28:12.240 --> 28:17.200]  so literally blackwater running around naked with machine gun shooting people
[28:17.200 --> 28:22.640]  injecting steroids and snorting cocaine that's exactly what the Iraqis and the
[28:22.640 --> 28:26.400]  Afghans of others they said these people are demonic animals
[28:26.400 --> 28:31.360]  yes exactly there are no less than 20,000 people will be killed like that by the
[28:31.360 --> 28:36.360]  security contractor and by what they call the collateral damage I don't know
[28:36.360 --> 28:44.800]  this is something which is very very illusionary that anybody can be killed
[28:44.800 --> 28:51.040]  if it happens to be collateral damage so there is something which is to call
[28:51.040 --> 28:57.320]  crossfire and crossfire if somebody is not in the crossfire and it's killed I
[28:57.320 --> 29:02.600]  think there has to be accountability you have got to amend your laws and you to
[29:02.600 --> 29:06.720]  make sure that civilian on the one hand you talk about human rights on the one
[29:06.720 --> 29:12.040]  hand you talk about humanitarian causes and on the other you are in the name of
[29:12.040 --> 29:16.480]  collateral damage causing so much resentment of one nation is not going to
[29:16.480 --> 29:21.880]  forget this this is terrible but you have got to apologize and perhaps they
[29:21.880 --> 29:27.200]  will demand retribution so far America the Taliban and those people who are
[29:27.200 --> 29:31.840]  likely to win the war they have not come up with this demand but I won't be
[29:31.840 --> 29:35.840]  surprised if they say that you have got to pay the compensation for the people
[29:35.840 --> 29:40.640]  that you have killed in Pakistan alone more than 2,000 people civilians have
[29:40.640 --> 29:45.200]  been killed because of the drone attacks all right general good my opinion is
[29:45.200 --> 29:49.320]  going to be the Lockerbie case we've got a break sir we've got a break we've got
[29:49.320 --> 29:55.440]  a break stay there we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and

[33:17.600 --> 33:23.000]  planet is waking up congressman Ron Paul the true leader of the resistance
[33:23.000 --> 33:27.080]  against tyranny in North America has said there is no doubt we are going to
[33:27.080 --> 33:32.240]  completely collapse probably within two years this has all been engineered and
[33:32.240 --> 33:37.000]  the murder of Iraqis over a million of them the British Medical Journal admits
[33:37.000 --> 33:40.800]  and they've done studies in the last eight years hundreds of thousands of
[33:40.800 --> 33:44.960]  dead Afghans not in my name not in George Washington's name not in the
[33:44.960 --> 33:49.800]  republic's name they are trying to start a clash of civilizations a war with
[33:49.800 --> 33:55.160]  the diverse Islamic nations both secular and and and purely Islamic in the
[33:55.160 --> 34:00.800]  Middle East and Central Asia as well as Far East this is a plan it's on paper
[34:00.800 --> 34:07.400]  it's PNAC Dick Cheney we do not need to play along with this and clearly for my
[34:07.400 --> 34:11.120]  analysis they're trying to destabilize Pakistan as a pretext to go in and take
[34:11.120 --> 34:16.880]  over their nukes that is not gonna work the Pakistan's people have never given
[34:16.880 --> 34:20.800]  up they've never lost the Afghans have never given up never lost that they're
[34:20.800 --> 34:25.760]  very similar to the frontier people in the United States you can't starve them
[34:25.760 --> 34:30.080]  out you can't make them run they're not gonna give up they don't value Hollywood
[34:30.080 --> 34:35.120]  Crud and baloney they value their families and their honor and as the
[34:35.120 --> 34:39.760]  founder of the Texas Rangers said a man in the wrong can't stand up against a man
[34:39.760 --> 34:46.000]  in the right who keeps on a coming and there is no way that this is gonna end
[34:46.000 --> 34:50.600]  the way the media tells you it's gonna end in disgrace and bankruptcy for this
[34:50.600 --> 34:55.480]  country we have got to get out of there now and we've and and and not just
[34:55.480 --> 34:59.400]  apologize explain that the military industrial complex did this not the
[34:59.400 --> 35:03.960]  American people but also help rebuild these societies and be friends with
[35:03.960 --> 35:07.640]  everyone as Ron Paul says as Dr. Paul says we're talking to General Hameed
[35:07.640 --> 35:12.560]  ghoul probably I mean even mainstream media admits the global expert on the
[35:12.560 --> 35:18.120]  Taliban what the Al Qaeda really is CIA group on everything that's happening over
[35:18.120 --> 35:21.800]  there and he's got the floor for the rest of the hour continue to talk about
[35:21.800 --> 35:26.360]  all the things that are happening and and the other quote military mistakes
[35:26.360 --> 35:32.080]  yeah mistakes like a fox crazy like a fox and where this is leading what's
[35:32.080 --> 35:35.760]  going to happen because I mean I'm not seeing signs that these policies are
[35:35.760 --> 35:39.120]  being reversed they're being accelerated general
[35:39.120 --> 35:44.280]  yes indeed they are being accelerated at the moment and the Pentagon is
[35:44.280 --> 35:49.360]  demanding more troops and more money but I can tell you that there are three
[35:49.360 --> 35:57.120]  determinants of where are the outcome of the war in the comfort zone and these
[35:57.120 --> 36:02.880]  are time space and relative strength as far as time is concerned Pentagon
[36:02.880 --> 36:07.160]  probably has the watch but Taliban and the resistance fighters they have the
[36:07.160 --> 36:11.800]  time on their side and they have the initiative and they have the mass yes
[36:11.800 --> 36:17.800]  they have the mass also that relative strength I will come to you that space
[36:17.800 --> 36:24.800]  spaces they control 85% of the spaces are controlled by Taliban so even if the
[36:24.800 --> 36:29.400]  Americans as they are thinking now that they would hold into some garrison
[36:29.400 --> 36:36.600]  towns and sit there for the time the cows come home it's not going to work I
[36:36.600 --> 36:41.640]  tell you once the spaces are in the control of the opposition you will be
[36:41.640 --> 36:48.080]  squeezed in so never make that mistake for God's sake because I'm I'm talking
[36:48.080 --> 36:52.520]  on behalf of the people of America because this is going to really create
[36:52.520 --> 36:57.640]  help for them and the third one is the relative strength as far as Taliban
[36:57.640 --> 37:02.920]  ranks are concerned they are swelling they are already drawing recruits from
[37:02.920 --> 37:09.720]  all over the world and Al-Qaeda may have moved out much of it as of course a lot
[37:09.720 --> 37:15.280]  of it is a myth but whatever it is they are themselves accepting Leon Pinnata has
[37:15.280 --> 37:20.280]  accepted the other day that only about 60 to 100 Al-Qaeda members are left in
[37:20.280 --> 37:25.960]  this area Pakistan and Afghanistan rest of them have all gone out to the Red Sea
[37:25.960 --> 37:34.840]  area to Somalia to Yemen and and to Chad and to Central African Republic and
[37:34.840 --> 37:40.000]  many other countries 60 to 100 may be found in any of the European countries
[37:40.000 --> 37:46.240]  Al-Qaeda members you know that there been this red warning going out to the
[37:46.240 --> 37:50.200]  European countries because the Europeans want to bail out they really want to get
[37:50.200 --> 37:57.640]  out of this mess and the Americans are now trying to the Pentagon and the CIA
[37:57.640 --> 38:03.280]  want to sound warnings to them that look if you go out then Al-Qaeda will
[38:03.280 --> 38:09.440]  change you to your own countries now this is not true I think the peace initiative
[38:09.440 --> 38:14.440]  has to be taken and they are trying to take the peace initiative through
[38:14.440 --> 38:22.240]  general since she raises I have to interrupt on this point we have some
[38:22.240 --> 38:27.680]  of the White House advisors in the Financial Times of London Robert
[38:27.680 --> 38:32.280]  Shapiro and others telling Obama we need an Oklahoma City or a 9-11 to get the
[38:32.280 --> 38:36.840]  initiative going it's going to be the NATO option or Operation Gladio I'm sure
[38:36.840 --> 38:40.760]  you know about the state behind networks in Europe and you're going to have black
[38:40.760 --> 38:45.800]  ops staging terror attacks and blaming it on Islamic patsies or funding
[38:45.800 --> 38:51.120]  middle mentally ill patsies one of their other favorite tactics as a pretext to
[38:51.120 --> 38:58.720]  keep Europe in this overall strategy of neocolonial empire show from my
[38:58.720 --> 39:03.760]  analysis correct me if you disagree there is no true Islamic network in
[39:03.760 --> 39:07.720]  Western Europe planning to stage terror attacks and from a strategic view they
[39:07.720 --> 39:12.440]  know they do blow stuff up that's going to create you know the London blitz
[39:12.440 --> 39:17.960]  syndrome where the Europeans are going to then want to go to war with Central
[39:17.960 --> 39:24.760]  Asia even more so I believe the whole thing is a election stunt as the mail
[39:24.760 --> 39:28.040]  online reports Pakistan accuses the White House of exaggerating Al-Qaeda
[39:28.040 --> 39:34.000]  terror threat ahead of election absolutely right I think that this
[39:34.000 --> 39:40.960]  myth is being overblown and I think now the world is getting a visor to it how
[39:40.960 --> 39:45.280]  long can they play this dirty game I don't think that it will be possible
[39:45.280 --> 39:49.920]  for them to continue to play this game okay please continue where you left off
[39:49.920 --> 39:54.320]  you were getting into Europe wants to get out go ahead yes so Europe wants to
[39:54.320 --> 39:58.000]  get out obviously for good reason because they're spending money they don't
[39:58.000 --> 40:02.800]  want to suffer casualties there the call is not there you very rightly pointed out
[40:02.800 --> 40:09.240]  by the quotation by somebody that you have to have a moral foundation to what
[40:09.240 --> 40:13.600]  you are doing otherwise you do not have the morale in the forces and the
[40:13.600 --> 40:18.760]  relative strength depends much on the morale as Napoleon said moral to
[40:18.760 --> 40:24.160]  material is like three to one so you don't have you are one to three already
[40:24.160 --> 40:28.960]  even if you have a lot of firepower on your side but where can you use your
[40:28.960 --> 40:33.160]  firepower every time you have tried to use firepower you have been there in
[40:33.160 --> 40:39.360]  terrible atrocities to you know sensibility and so really firepower alone
[40:39.360 --> 40:44.280]  cannot as far as space is concerned I've told you that you cannot stay there I
[40:44.280 --> 40:48.960]  can assure you that the farms will close into those garrison town and they
[40:48.960 --> 40:54.800]  will bit by bit take them down well I mean you talk about initiative or morale
[40:54.800 --> 40:58.940]  killing a bunch of people at weddings and bombing children and killing Pakistan
[40:58.940 --> 41:05.200]  regular army troops cowardly from you know CIA controlled drones 10,000 miles
[41:05.200 --> 41:10.880]  away that is only going to enrage and expand the mass that you're supposedly
[41:10.880 --> 41:18.040]  fighting or remarkable I think there is an axiom military axiom which says that
[41:18.040 --> 41:23.960]  the bigger the area of conflict and longer the time of conflict the
[41:23.960 --> 41:29.240]  established power definitely loses and if the Americans are trying to extend the
[41:29.240 --> 41:35.040]  war into Pakistan side of the AFPA battlefield as they say then I'm sorry
[41:35.040 --> 41:40.640]  that they are going to be very very sad about it at the end of the day because
[41:40.640 --> 41:44.000]  they are not going to win well that's like the seven that's like the seven
[41:44.000 --> 41:48.680]  year war against the British Empire here in the colonies so continuing sir then
[41:48.680 --> 41:52.160]  where is this going if they're if they're accelerating it what are the
[41:52.160 --> 41:56.600]  different scenarios you see running from bad to worse how does this end what's
[41:56.600 --> 42:01.040]  the timetable general Hamid Ghul well I think by the end of December they will
[42:01.040 --> 42:05.320]  know exactly that they have got to change the policy if they don't then they
[42:05.320 --> 42:11.360]  will you can say that they are acting against the interest of America I can
[42:11.360 --> 42:16.320]  assure you this end of December after the elections are over if Obama does not
[42:16.320 --> 42:22.320]  change his policy then he is slave to the new cons he's slave to the Pentagon and
[42:22.320 --> 42:28.680]  to the CIA mafia that I think this is quite clear to me they are digging
[42:28.680 --> 42:33.560]  deeper into the hole from where they will not be able to come out so they
[42:33.560 --> 42:38.760]  have got to decide by the coming December that they have to quit of
[42:38.760 --> 42:44.680]  Afghanistan as soon as possible but they're arrogant they're filled with
[42:44.680 --> 42:49.280]  hubris they're looting and stealing everything here and worldwide I don't
[42:49.280 --> 42:54.880]  see them stopping I see them pulling a rabbit out of the hat I mean I'm I see
[42:54.880 --> 42:59.920]  as options for them detonating a nuke and claiming Al Qaeda did it and then
[42:59.920 --> 43:06.240]  nuclear attacks on Afghanistan maybe even Pakistan definitely Iran total
[43:06.240 --> 43:10.120]  police state lockdown I mean that's a real option for them as the and basically
[43:10.120 --> 43:14.520]  World War three Cheney we know three years ago or two and a half years ago on
[43:14.520 --> 43:21.120]  888 it's now been declassified did order the NATO Georgian forces to launch the
[43:21.120 --> 43:28.360]  attack on the Russian enclaves of Abkhazia and of course other areas and
[43:28.360 --> 43:35.000]  and South Ossetia and that the Pentagon basically refused at a point the Russians
[43:35.000 --> 43:41.920]  rolled in medium-range mobile nuke trucks and their top general the head of
[43:41.920 --> 43:45.520]  their their joint chiefs came out and said we're preparing for nuclear war he
[43:45.520 --> 43:49.680]  gave a press conference so I mean these people are completely psychopathic I I
[43:49.680 --> 43:53.560]  mean I'm not kidding when I tell listeners that we may be in the next
[43:53.560 --> 43:56.480]  year to two years on the verge of World War three
[43:56.480 --> 44:08.080]  well actually you may be right but I would still grant that they would be better sense that will prevail eventually end of the day and I trust the people of
[44:08.080 --> 44:14.120]  America like they did in case of Vietnam War you know they went on to whatever was
[44:14.120 --> 44:18.640]  known as the moratorium movement and picked up from the Berkeley campus and
[44:18.640 --> 44:23.000]  spread across the streets and bazaars of America and I think that forced the
[44:23.000 --> 44:28.520]  administration then to pull out of it so I think American people I place trust in
[44:28.520 --> 44:33.600]  the American people otherwise if you let them lose where they are doing at the
[44:33.600 --> 44:36.760]  moment then I think they will really bring that disaster as you are
[44:36.760 --> 44:41.320]  suggesting to the entire world but they have got to be stopped and who can stop
[44:41.320 --> 44:44.520]  them better than the American people themselves well general what about the
[44:44.520 --> 44:49.840]  military we know Admiral Fox Fallon the head of SENTCOM was ordered to attack
[44:49.840 --> 44:54.040]  Iran and he said no and resigned so we know there's good people in the
[44:54.040 --> 44:59.840]  military as well that's the irony that's the irony we are taught right in the
[44:59.840 --> 45:04.520]  beginning as young soldiers that look you have got to show character you've
[45:04.520 --> 45:09.120]  got to show respect for the life of your own people and if you think that there's
[45:09.120 --> 45:14.320]  something which is terribly wrong then the best choice is to resign and say get
[45:14.320 --> 45:19.080]  this job done by somebody else and how many people will they fire so I have a
[45:19.080 --> 45:24.200]  grouse against the American general if I was a superior I would have a lot of
[45:24.200 --> 45:30.200]  them court-martialed for not standing up to the political team guards like
[45:30.200 --> 45:35.160]  Rumsfeld and company because they knew that Rumsfeld was wrong but they were
[45:35.160 --> 45:39.440]  not telling Tommy Franks and others they simply bowed to the will of the
[45:39.440 --> 45:46.480]  political team guards absolutely but that message that Fox Fallon sent did
[45:46.480 --> 45:50.400]  shake him up enough to back off not attacking Iran I mean that that got the
[45:50.400 --> 45:55.640]  establishment's attention when their own guy said this is insane our fleet will
[45:55.640 --> 46:02.560]  be damaged and it's immoral to do this yes exactly you have to show character
[46:02.560 --> 46:06.800]  general is to show character and if it doesn't have character then he is
[46:06.800 --> 46:11.800]  irresponsible toward the life and safety of his own people his own soldiers who
[46:11.800 --> 46:16.440]  are prepared to lay down their lives on his orders it is highly immoral that you
[46:16.440 --> 46:21.800]  put them in the harm's way you throw them out to the winds without giving
[46:21.800 --> 46:26.720]  consideration to the fact that it is winnable or not now this war from the
[46:26.720 --> 46:31.000]  beginning was not winnable then the American general should have said this
[46:31.000 --> 46:35.880]  it's alright I'm a professional soldier I'm prepared to debate it with any general
[46:35.880 --> 46:41.000]  of America that look this was not winnable why did you come and bash
[46:41.000 --> 46:45.840]  yourself first in Afghanistan and then in Iraq because these two areas have been
[46:45.840 --> 46:52.480]  described by famous historian Arnold Toynbee as the eastern and western roundabout
[46:52.480 --> 46:57.880]  of this region eastern roundabout with the historical forces come and they
[46:57.880 --> 47:01.800]  knock themselves against the mountains dry mountains of Afghanistan and their
[47:01.800 --> 47:07.560]  words and similarly about Iraq he said once you get into this roundabout there
[47:07.560 --> 47:13.560]  is no way that you can win so America did exactly the same thing as they
[47:13.560 --> 47:18.320]  should not have done and Churchill once said that America eventually does the
[47:18.320 --> 47:23.840]  right thing after they've exhausted all the wrong options well Alexander the
[47:23.840 --> 47:27.760]  great conquered everybody huge empires but as soon as he made the scene in
[47:27.760 --> 47:31.600]  Afghanistan and Pakistan that was the end of the road and he basically pulled
[47:31.600 --> 47:35.480]  out and then died but I mean for those that don't know the history of this I
[47:35.480 --> 47:42.720]  mean no one has ever defeated the the the the Pakistani and Afghan people which
[47:42.720 --> 47:45.800]  of course you know share a lot of connections for those that don't know
[47:45.800 --> 47:50.360]  tribally and in historically but all these empires have tried to come there
[47:50.360 --> 47:54.680]  and control that key juncture between east and west briefly general can you
[47:54.680 --> 48:00.600]  explain to them the culture the spirit I mean that you know goes back thousands
[48:00.600 --> 48:07.400]  of years to this region and the people there fundamentally understand they've
[48:07.400 --> 48:14.240]  never been conquered so can you speak to that general can you talk about the
[48:14.240 --> 48:23.480]  culture over there I think we lost his line that that happened last time
[48:23.480 --> 48:26.960]  general ghoul can you hear me
[48:29.120 --> 48:33.360]  yeah call him right back that happens occasionally because I mean if that's the
[48:33.360 --> 48:38.160]  issue I mean imagine as Americans if there was a terror attack say in Russia
[48:38.160 --> 48:42.560]  and we weren't as powerful as we are you know with high-tech weapons and then
[48:42.560 --> 48:46.880]  Russians invaded claiming they were looking for terrorists and nine years
[48:46.880 --> 48:50.720]  later they're still there and then now they've moved drone attacks into Canada
[48:50.720 --> 48:54.200]  and the Canadian military is working with them and then they're bombing the
[48:54.200 --> 49:00.960]  Canadian military I mean that's the insanity of all of this information so
[49:00.960 --> 49:04.360]  who knows if the authorities listening and you better believe when you got
[49:04.360 --> 49:07.520]  somebody like Hamed ghoul on the phone the feds aren't just listening and the
[49:07.520 --> 49:10.480]  globalists aren't just listening to the internet or the AM and FM they are
[49:10.480 --> 49:13.200]  listening to the phone lines they are listening to everything we're doing
[49:13.200 --> 49:17.000]  right now and I hope they didn't cut his phone line I hope that we have a
[49:17.000 --> 49:21.680]  backup line to general Hamed ghoul plus there's technical difficulties I mean
[49:21.680 --> 49:27.240]  how far away is is Pakistan 9,000 miles away 10,000 miles away that means you
[49:27.240 --> 49:32.720]  know where you are in the United States but from Texas it's that's about 9,000
[49:32.720 --> 49:45.840]  miles away general ghoul the line got cut sir can you hear me general yes well
[49:45.840 --> 49:48.960]  we've got five minutes to the next hour so I'm gonna try to shut up it's just so
[49:48.960 --> 49:52.840]  riveting to you know to hear you lay all this out I was trying to get but we're
[49:52.840 --> 49:55.160]  about to go to break I was trying to get you to talk about the spirit of the
[49:55.160 --> 49:59.400]  Afghan and Pakistani people who've never been defeated and the foolishness of
[49:59.400 --> 50:04.640]  trying I mean all the main line experts said don't try this yeah 5,000 years of
[50:04.640 --> 50:08.760]  history if that was not enough and they didn't care to read about it they should
[50:08.760 --> 50:12.680]  have at least learned from the Russian experience and what did the Russian tell
[50:12.680 --> 50:17.640]  them before they were invading the Russian said please for God's sake there is a
[50:17.640 --> 50:23.240]  lesson from our own history reason why don't you learn nobody is going to come
[50:23.240 --> 50:29.360]  out of the forest on unscathed I was once told by an Afghan Mujahid commander he
[50:29.360 --> 50:36.080]  says look at these bare mountains we have nothing to eat or somebody invades us
[50:36.080 --> 50:40.880]  he brings something with us with him and when he leaves he leaves all that
[50:40.880 --> 50:45.440]  behind in the forest on and that is how we survive our general general going to
[50:45.440 --> 50:49.560]  break stay there we got 10 more minutes with you after the break and I want to
[50:49.560 --> 50:55.040]  walk through this history when we return and talk about the Russian experience
[50:55.040 --> 50:59.680]  I mean they could beat the Nazis but they couldn't beat the Afghans
[50:59.680 --> 51:04.960]  global meltdowns massive unemployment endless wars a new currency crisis
[51:04.960 --> 51:09.640]  financially and morally bankrupt a great and terrible storm is approaching so
[51:09.640 --> 51:13.080]  what's the best way to get ready to get prepared for hard times ahead in
[51:13.080 --> 51:17.760]  producing off-the-grid news a weekly newsletter for independent patriots who
[51:17.760 --> 51:21.600]  want practical advice on how to survive and prosper in an increasingly

[54:13.400 --> 54:18.040]  them they could never win even if they had all our weapons because they don't
[54:18.040 --> 54:22.520]  have the moral right just like the British Empire never beaten until the
[54:22.520 --> 54:29.200]  1776 war never beaten you know they beat Napoleon 20 years later but they
[54:29.200 --> 54:33.880]  couldn't beat the farmers of the colonies general ghoul before you got
[54:33.880 --> 54:39.080]  interrupted there by your line being cut or muted please continue down that
[54:39.080 --> 54:43.160]  line of explaining to people who the Afghan and Pakistan people are
[54:43.160 --> 54:48.960]  historically for five thousand years they have resisted the invaders and all
[54:48.960 --> 54:53.840]  kinds of invaders have come and they have gone with bloody nose out of this
[54:53.840 --> 55:00.320]  area you see I am a student of military history as any military historian will
[55:00.320 --> 55:06.160]  tell you that nations cannot be defeated by invaders no matter how the strong
[55:06.160 --> 55:12.400]  armies are how strong firepower they have nations cannot be armies can be
[55:12.400 --> 55:18.200]  defeated by armies but nations cannot be defeated by invading armies and it is
[55:18.200 --> 55:22.520]  true of the Afghans if it's true of anybody in the world this is a very
[55:22.520 --> 55:29.040]  special race they are Mullahs, Mujahed, the traders and the fighters at the same
[55:29.040 --> 55:33.640]  time so really Afghan nation fights as a whole
[55:33.640 --> 55:40.760]  Churchill said that in Afghanistan the fighting begins only after the invaders
[55:40.760 --> 55:45.520]  have captured Afghanistan that means the resistance begins from that point
[55:45.520 --> 55:50.960]  onwards similarly Russians when they came in they had initially thought that
[55:50.960 --> 55:54.680]  they would put down the Afghan resistance in three months time and they
[55:54.680 --> 55:59.720]  stayed for more than ten years and how did they go out with the general
[55:59.720 --> 56:06.480]  Gramov walking across the Amur river bridge in the middle he didn't turn
[56:06.480 --> 56:11.960]  back but he prayed to himself and now in his book he has mentioned he said we
[56:11.960 --> 56:17.000]  will never return to Afghanistan that means they had made a huge mistake they
[56:17.000 --> 56:20.720]  were in superpower they had enormous amount of firepower at their disposal
[56:20.720 --> 56:25.840]  and they were far more ruthless than the Americans could ever be but they could
[56:25.840 --> 56:31.640]  not defeat the Afghan spirit because the nation of Afghanistan was fighting as a
[56:31.640 --> 56:37.480]  whole and now this is not a Taliban movement it must be understood that it
[56:37.480 --> 56:43.000]  is a national resistance by Afghan people and they simply cannot be defeated
[56:43.000 --> 56:47.200]  there is no history there is no example in history where a nation can be
[56:47.200 --> 56:52.760]  defeated by the invading armies in fact the exact same signature paradigm
[56:52.760 --> 56:57.440]  roadmap of what's happened every other time including with the Russians is now
[56:57.440 --> 57:05.000]  playing out and accelerating and when you look at that and understand that it is
[57:05.000 --> 57:11.080]  a it is a frightening thing to show how delusional the ruling class is that
[57:11.080 --> 57:17.240]  runs this country yeah indeed the Russians are now according to my
[57:17.240 --> 57:22.840]  information it's still not confirmed by but I think it is clear it's quite
[57:22.840 --> 57:27.720]  authentic that Russians are trying to reach out to Pakistan and to the Afghan
[57:27.720 --> 57:32.640]  resistance now because they are already looking at this vacuum which will be
[57:32.640 --> 57:37.880]  caused by the American withdrawal which inevitably is going to happen so the
[57:37.880 --> 57:43.320]  Russians are smelling similar kind of situation which the Americans smelled
[57:43.320 --> 57:47.360]  earlier on but they would come militarily they will come commercially they
[57:47.360 --> 57:51.760]  will come with open arms they will come as friends and I think the Russians will
[57:51.760 --> 57:56.040]  be the net gainers and what a laugh they will have they will laugh all the way to
[57:56.040 --> 58:02.480]  the bank and to the to the to the bazaar of Moscow that look eventually we have
[58:02.480 --> 58:07.720]  taken it out against the Americans well just like the US is now friends with
[58:07.720 --> 58:13.920]  Vietnam Ho Chi Minh wanted to be friends from the beginning yes that's right and
[58:13.920 --> 58:19.120]  now imagine that what did you do like pulling out of Vietnam did you do
[58:19.120 --> 58:23.520]  something wrong no it was the right thing to do and it was a morally
[58:23.520 --> 58:29.840]  correct thing to do and now in a foreign you have to really the game is now

[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:19.720]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCM radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:25.160]  Alex Jones all right it's our final segment with General Hamid Ghul former
[01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:32.240]  head of package a Pakistani intelligence the gentleman who led the war and the
[01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:36.440]  victory against the Russian bear he's here saying you tell me during the break
[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:40.880]  look I love America I'm your friend you'll stop this and and we understand
[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:45.360]  that we understand what's happening is is wrong but I look at Russia Russia
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:51.240]  finally fell just within a year and a half of the end of the 10-year Afghan
[01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:57.200]  War now as if that isn't enough our crazy government is trying to not just
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:02.880]  attack Afghanistan but go after Pakistan in a roundabout way I mean it's it's
[01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:06.600]  it's it's it I mean you're talking about a 10,000-pound gorilla that they're
[01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:10.280]  trying to beat and now they want to take on a 10,000-pound tiger while they're
[01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:16.120]  at it and and basically our country's the equivalent of a giant 10,000-pound
[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:20.680]  weasel and it's just not gonna win and General Ghul we got about four minutes
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:26.400]  left but what about that parallel with Russia collapsing right after they lost
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:31.320]  we see the US on the verge of financial collapse just like Russia as we're
[01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:35.640]  losing in the same place what is it I mean do countries go to Pakistan and
[01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:39.600]  Afghanistan to die I mean is that where you go when you're a crazy empire if
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:44.560]  you're Alexander the Great or anybody do you go there to be crushed well that's
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:48.080]  what happened what's been happening I think it is you mentioned this imperial
[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:54.000]  hubris and the arrogance of a superpower they had the opportunity to control the
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.720]  world to manage it properly to be friendly to the Muslim world particularly if
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:04.920]  they wanted resources of this region to be exploited for their carpet world but
[01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:10.200]  they went about it the wrong way because some people some crazy mafia people
[01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:16.000]  they tried to frame the policies for American people this was the this was
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:21.160]  the unfortunate work and twist in the history of America and I think they're
[01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:26.440]  going to pay the price for it but price can be lessened now because if the
[01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:31.560]  sense prevailed let's say I put on the outside the time frame of December if
[01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:36.960]  Obama reviews his policy and he can with the help of the public opinion in
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:42.600]  America if he can light a candle in front of these people who are forcing him
[01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:48.600]  into certain line of action then I'm sure that America will come out of it
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:54.880]  very much very very much certain bruised but I think America may save itself in
[01:02:54.880 --> 01:03:00.360]  the end and if they do not then the certain vacuum that will be created
[01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:07.800]  that will destroy India that will destroy the region as a whole and it will
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:14.400]  give radical forces a space to expand themselves for for a very very long time
[01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:20.680]  in this region exactly it will be a breeding ground of extremist yes
[01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:25.720]  indeed they are people of their freedom and those people who are fighting with
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:30.880]  America they are going to be very sorry because after all they risked their own
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:37.360]  life and their own well-being in order to serve America America's cause was wrong
[01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:41.760]  so America not only is going to hurt itself but it's going to hurt its friends as well
[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:46.360]  and I think it is going to have a fallout effect on Israel as well as India
[01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:51.440]  and inferno will have been ignited which will be very difficult to control and
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:56.360]  put down for a very long time general and 45 seconds how if you were the
[01:03:56.360 --> 01:04:02.400]  United States would you cut your losses well immediately talk to Taliban
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:07.280]  leadership the real leadership they are not trying to cut right to do that this
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:12.360]  is roundabout way of going there doing the things and this is not going to work
[01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:16.680]  they should talk to them and they should say okay we accept we are going to withdraw
[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:24.240]  from Afghanistan everything is going to be all right I can assure you I am sort
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:29.520]  of very close observant of the Afghan psyche they are not going to change you
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:34.960]  to America they will be your friend like the victim is our friend now but if it
[01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:39.240]  goes on for another couple of years then there will be a lot of problem on hand
[01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:45.920]  very well said General Hamid Ghul thank you for trying to bring peace and in
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:49.800]  honor and we appreciate you look forward to speaking to you again in the future

[01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:26.520]  one assault the announcements that they're gonna take all are part of the

[01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:55.040]  investigator probing Lake shooting slain down there on Falcon Lake they've had
[01:09:55.040 --> 01:10:00.320]  that's where the helicopters come up to six seven miles in to the u.s. they
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:06.080]  land and raid people in the towns I mean this is all over south Texas news for a
[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:12.120]  year they reportedly kill people and the police just pull back under scared the
[01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:17.680]  feds have cut the federal aid down there for police when they ask for more they
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:22.480]  cut it they've ordered according to the Arizona Republic and CNS news cyber
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:26.600]  news service sheriff's on record saying that the quietly the border patrol has
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:30.080]  been ordered to pull back ten miles from the border that happened three months
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:34.840]  ago in Arizona and Texas they'll go have photo ops with a few thousand troops
[01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:40.960]  here and there and border patrol it's and this poor woman witnesses have
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:44.920]  stepped forward that heard the shots solar running on this giant lake that's
[01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:48.840]  supposedly some of the best fishing in Texas and they don't even warrant her
[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:54.240]  it's not to go down there it's kind of like I see ads on TV and I hear radio
[01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:59.040]  ads and I see print ads and I know people who have children who are getting
[01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:04.720]  out of high school and the thing to do all over the US I know we did it was
[01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:08.960]  when you graduate from high school you go to Cancun and get stinkin drunk or you
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:12.640]  go to some of the other areas those places now have kidnappings and shootings
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:17.680]  and if you go one block off the reservation and nobody warns you you get
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:23.560]  kidnapped you get killed it's just incredible I remember when I was in
[01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:26.080]  college I was down in Cancun it was early in the morning I was down there
[01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:28.840]  drinking coffee because you know it's just a few hundred bucks to fly down
[01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:34.760]  there it's cheap and you know my friends were all asleep and I was down there
[01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:39.200]  with a hangover and drinking coffee by the beach and these two guys came up and
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:42.680]  said hey we want to sell you some pot and I said I don't smoke pot and they said
[01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:47.560]  well come on down the beach with us and I said no no thank you and then a week
[01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:50.680]  later I heard about people being kidnapped college students down in Cancun
[01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:55.320]  now they don't even really tell you about this they don't warn Texans hey
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:58.960]  don't go to Falcon Lake or these other lakes that border Mexico people are
[01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:04.160]  being killed kidnapped you name it I mean US Embassy staff are being machine
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:10.480]  gunned and and and and hand-grenaded and and and killed they're killing police
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:16.120]  chiefs and mayors every two or three days I mean Mexico there's never been a
[01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:20.760]  revolution like this it's a revolution of corruption and evil and you're not
[01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:24.080]  supposed to talk about it you've got part of the public siding with the
[01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:27.040]  smaller cartels because they have their own courts and own system and own
[01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:30.440]  justice and you've got the big corrupt government that runs most the drugs and
[01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:34.400]  controls the society you've got a giant population you've got Mexico City being
[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:37.800]  hell on earth you've got a lot of good decent Christian hard-working people down
[01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:41.920]  there who are stuck in the middle of it and that woman's husband gets shot in
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:46.760]  the head there's already been just total bedlam on that lake and I talk to most
[01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:49.720]  Texans and I go do you know how dangerous it is to go fishing in South
[01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:52.800]  Texas to go to the border no I heard there might be a little something down
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:55.600]  there I've been talking about this intensely saying don't get near the
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:59.440]  border for six years in Arizona and Texas and now even California and other
[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:05.440]  areas is getting super bad I knew Mexico and people look at me like I had five
[01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:10.160]  heads I mean they look at you like you're a nut hey look at the newspaper
[01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:12.920]  they're announcing world government and the same banks and injured the crisis
[01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:16.200]  are gonna run it and they're gonna taxes oh shut up cook there's no world
[01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:20.080]  government well here's AP here's time magazine here's the financial times of
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:24.560]  London hey you know a truck bomb went off in Dallas a few years ago that the
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:28.640]  Mexican mafia detonated and people look at you like you're crazy it's a tiny
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:34.680]  blurb in the Dallas morning news I mean this is the can you imagine if some
[01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:38.720]  militia did a truck bomb I mean they'd act like it was the end of the world we
[01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:42.360]  got a band guns we got to surveil everybody my goodness some people got
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:47.560]  killed in a truck bomb I mean you go down to areas on the border where we
[01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:51.280]  would go in college that were nice hotels you go across eat cheap you know
[01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:54.760]  everything now it's all boarded up and it looks like something out of the
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:59.240]  road warrior and you tell people this and they laugh at you will not now this
[01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:03.680]  poor woman's husband gets shot in the head riding around his jet ski down
[01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:09.200]  there and CBS News the Democrats come out and go I bet she's lying and then
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:11.920]  witnesses came forward and said no we we heard the gunshots and saw her
[01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:15.800]  running and then now the Mexican investigators sent because Rick Perry's
[01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:18.840]  you know grandstanding and you know at least politically saying I want to call
[01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:22.480]  from the president I want to call from Colorado I want something to be done so
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:26.620]  they send a Mexican and police investigator there and he's delayed his
[01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:30.680]  severed head is delivered to the military no nine ten nine chances out of
[01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:35.040]  ten the military just takes their uniforms off it's on record they escort
[01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:38.280]  the drugs up to the border and they try to keep the other cartels from bringing
[01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:42.280]  it in they're there to make sure they have you know the operation the only
[01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:47.200]  war going on is when other cartels try to break the blockade that's what's
[01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:52.960]  happening in this 500 billion dollar 500 billion dollar year industry Justin
[01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:59.760]  cocaine and heroin and marijuana coming across that border 500 black dollars a
[01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:04.480]  black dollar is worth conservatively ten times with rational reserve banking
[01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:08.400]  what a white dollar is and now I'm not talking about black people I'm gonna
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:11.520]  talk about white slavery folks go you're not against black slavery white
[01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:15.840]  slavery sex slavery folks black person white person and forcing the sex
[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:19.520]  slavery it's white slavery it's the same thing with black dollars black op
[01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:25.160]  money that money is an untaxable secret you can then put it into banks and
[01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:29.680]  leverage it at least ten times and with derivatives you can limit it you can
[01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:34.320]  leverage it to the stars you can you can leverage it to to Alpha Centuries you
[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:39.360]  it just it's a it's unlimited 500 billion a year 500 billions the same
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:42.760]  number roughly coming out of Afghanistan and heroin so that's a trillion right
[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:47.640]  there total just in those two sectors the US is one of the biggest users in
[01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:54.520]  illegal drugs or the biggest excuse me in the world and the idiots using this
[01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:59.360]  stuff are funding and I hate drugs but you decriminalize it to shut off the
[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:05.240]  money and you would see all these drug laundering banks drug laundering
[01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:08.800]  prison companies oh yeah that's the drug dealers on the prisons to the big
[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:11.400]  corporations and then when you use their product they put you in there as a
[01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:16.200]  slave building widgets see how genius that is and then that displaces workers
[01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:20.400]  outside drives down wages further I'm not against prisoners just like I'm not
[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:24.160]  against illegal aliens I'm against illegal aliens being paid under what
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:28.440]  they should be paid because it drives down wages I'm against using prison
[01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:31.800]  labor because it drives down wages this is all very elementary this is all
[01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:36.680]  extremely simple to understand but the media tries to confuse it so this poor
[01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:42.240]  woman her husband gets killed capped in the head and the media tries to imply
[01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:47.040]  she's a liar even though that lake is a hellhole of crime but no one warns them
[01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:52.720]  no one warns the stupid UT students by the tens of thousands every year loading
[01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:56.480]  up on the cheap you know hundred fifty dollar airfare and flying down to areas
[01:16:56.480 --> 01:17:00.680]  of Mexico to be raped Rob looted and killed you've got Robert Rodriguez's
[01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:05.320]  movie machete glorifying the coyotes even though the coyotes rob and loot
[01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:08.720]  and rape and kill and steal from the immigrants who come in from South
[01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:13.080]  America Central America into Mexico and I see articles all the time you know
[01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:17.280]  15 or 16 year old girl wanted to be a coyote and fight for the la raza and
[01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:21.920]  metcha she traveled to Mexico was raped and killed by Cody she met with yeah I
[01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:26.760]  mean it it's an acceleration of evil it's all these evil groups in Mexico
[01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:30.680]  fighting with each other it's a corrupt system a culture that's given into
[01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:35.520]  corruption and so it's a survival of the most evil of the most vicious and it's
[01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:43.600]  now pouring all over the US Chicago Dallas San Antonio Los Angeles Miami DC
[01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:49.360]  and I mean these hardcore Mexican drug gangs are even worse than the Russian
[01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:54.400]  mafia more vicious just just out of the police are now going into the the phase
[01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:57.880]  of putting their tail between their legs you think the cops rather pull over
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:02.280]  your 75 year old mother and shaker down with a bunch of fake tickets or take
[01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:05.960]  your blood at a checkpoint sitting you to jail for having two beers you think
[01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:09.920]  they'd rather pull over a domesticated cowed cowardly American and I'm sorry
[01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:13.760]  that's the kind of our spirit now not the eagle the ostrich I'm saying on average
[01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:17.720]  we can get our greatness back do they want to pull you over and suck off you
[01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:21.920]  or you think they want to mess with the Mexican mafia that tried to blow up the
[01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:25.680]  LAPD police department a few months ago because they arrested a few of their
[01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:33.440]  hitmen see that's what's happening that's what's going on death squads total
[01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:37.920]  evil and they want to tell all the yuppies oh go on down to those legs oh
[01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:42.800]  no this lady's lying nobody shot her husband in the head and then they send
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:47.440]  an investigator and I'll guarantee you the Mexican military took him and said
[01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:52.400]  we're gonna show you who runs things here and they cut his head off and they
[01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:57.800]  said oh look the drug dealers brought us his head the Mexican military has almost
[01:18:57.800 --> 01:19:02.400]  complete control of that border it's on video it's on record the videos have been
[01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:08.800]  shot by the Minutemen it's the videos have been shot by by sheriffs we've
[01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:12.120]  shown them many times you could just search Mexican military escorting
[01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:16.320]  illegals escorting drugs I've interviewed sheriffs we should get them back on
[01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:23.120]  from South Texas where they pick up a van full of marijuana and cocaine in one
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:27.680]  case they were three miles over the border on a highway Mexican Humvees block
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:32.480]  them off on the US side get out and say get down on the ground give us the drugs
[01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:36.720]  the Mexican military gets in the truck drives it back and what is what are the
[01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:42.920]  feds do they literally wet themselves they are bedwetting criminals they are
[01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:46.400]  owned I'm talking about the FBI and others that they they are only good at
[01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:49.280]  shaking the American people down and getting their cut of drug money when
[01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:53.800]  when actual people with machismo and machine guns say I'm ready to die let's

[01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:40.760]  we're gonna get into the economy and it's I'm kind of shying away from even
[01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:44.720]  covering this it's painful to look at and I got three beautiful wonderful
[01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:50.560]  children a wonderful beautiful wife I love this country and I hope America
[01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:54.080]  hasn't seen its best times but there's no doubt if we're going into a living
[01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:58.720]  hell on every front if we don't get out of our trance and America is under a
[01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:06.000]  spell a trance a mind control system of propaganda and semantical deception if we
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:13.400]  don't shake ourselves out of this it's gonna be a lot more painful and it's
[01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:19.640]  just that simple tyranny is as old as the hills it's as old as our species and
[01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:23.880]  there's no doubt this is the biggest baddest most scientific version of it
[01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:28.280]  I've ever studied in history and it's happening now we got front row seats and
[01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:34.360]  we got to get out of our seats and not just be spectators to this fiasco but
[01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:39.320]  get out there in the game and just say look nobody can deny the direction we're
[01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:43.960]  going in is bad news and it's even bad news for the ruling class they're out of
[01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:49.440]  control and that happens with every other empire every other group of lunatics
[01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:52.920]  on a power trip and look at how the corruption of Mexico is grown and grown
[01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:58.000]  the people are the same everywhere Mexico never had a chance to not be a
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:02.120]  colonial system it never had a chance to have any freedom most other nations
[01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:05.440]  never had a chance so they never had a chance at real wealth except for their
[01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:12.480]  tiny ruling class of fat cats of El Jefe's and you look at Waco integrating
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:17.400]  this in with what's happening in Mexico David Koresh was a weirdo he went into
[01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:22.200]  town every day they had an auto repair shop a mile away you know I know the
[01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:25.760]  surviving Davidians well we built a memorial church there I studied it in
[01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:29.000]  depth watch all the congressional hearings read the declassified files and
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:32.960]  it was like a hot dog roast or something with the ATF wanting to get more
[01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:36.880]  funding the feds want to distract everybody from the World Trade Center
[01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:39.440]  bombing it just happened a few months before it was in the news that the feds
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:43.360]  had cooked the bomb train the driver and they said how do we sell this roll out
[01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:46.000]  of anti-terror forces against the American people this has come out in
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:50.760]  Congress and they said well these people are a bunch of weirdos and we'll hype it
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:55.440]  up and exaggerate it again that's their statement about them and I agree it but
[01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:59.360]  you know some stuff was weird most of it was exaggerated or lies and they said
[01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:03.040]  we'll go in there and have a big shootout with them and it's on record the
[01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:07.440]  ATF pulled up in those trailers and all their body armor and just opened fire on
[01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:11.360]  that wooden church shooting a bunch of people and the Davidians got their guns
[01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:16.960]  started shooting back and as soon as the cops said you know white flag soon as
[01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:22.800]  the feds said white flag truce the Davidians stopped shooting and they came
[01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:26.560]  back and had a 51 day siege and burned the place of the ground and had Delta
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:30.640]  force go in and kill them and there's the flare footage of Delta force behind
[01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:34.280]  the Bradleys you know and the troops and set the place on fire and that's what
[01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:38.880]  they did so they're real tough when they're burning down a church with a
[01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:43.080]  bunch of little kids in it they're real tough when they're coming you know a
[01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:45.560]  hundred of them in the dark at night to take your farm or ranch because you
[01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:48.720]  quote couldn't pay the taxes you didn't couldn't pay the rent on your
[01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:53.040]  supposed castle on your private property they're real tough and they got this
[01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:56.880]  sick mentally ill culture just like the general public but their own variant of
[01:27:56.880 --> 01:28:00.520]  it that they're doing this for the good and everything no no you're not doing
[01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:04.360]  it for the good anything okay a pack of criminal banks around this country they
[01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:08.440]  have been stealing us blind since 1913 and now they've used our money and our
[01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:14.720]  energy to fund their world government and just like you're seeing bizarreness
[01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:17.640]  never before seen in any country going on in Mexico many people don't know what
[01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:24.240]  to call it a revolution a blooming of corruption a just a charnel house there
[01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:28.680]  are hundreds of new saints that are the skinny one and the grim reaper and just
[01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:34.600]  total death and black magic and Mexico is being sucked into hell and I got news
[01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:39.320]  for you we're gonna be sucked into our own high-tech version even worse what
[01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:44.240]  you're seeing in Mexico is nothing buildings being burned people being
[01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:48.680]  kidnapped killed attacks that's horrible the Mexican attorney general making his
[01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:52.680]  employees take microchips that's what you're gonna see the drugging of the
[01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:58.760]  food the water all the slow creeping serpent like boa constrictor death where
[01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:03.360]  it just quietly wraps around you slowly and then squeezes the soul out of you
[01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:09.840]  turning into you to a mindless consumer all these wicked wars the millions kill
[01:29:09.840 --> 01:29:14.640]  the government looting the the military people stealing their death benefits
[01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:18.080]  trying to make them pay for their own insurance it's making them breathe
[01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:22.160]  depleted uranium knowing it's a death sentence lying to him saying it's fine
[01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:31.040]  for you once you buy into evil once you give in to it once you stop being able
[01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:38.280]  to even recognize it the floor falls out a black hole opens up that's why evil
[01:29:38.280 --> 01:29:44.280]  so dangerous it doesn't stop here it's not sexy and cool it's death it's pain
[01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:51.400]  it's misery it's starving children it's humiliation it's bondage we're on the

[01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:30.680]  Jonathan Irish of course with the baby being snatched for him being affiliated
[01:33:30.680 --> 01:33:35.320]  with Oath Keepers he called me yesterday elated they were going to give them
[01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:40.360]  visitation today because of public pressure with the baby and to allow her
[01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:43.960]  to nurse the baby because baby needs the colostrum that first milk is so
[01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:50.680]  important and in the visitation with them they're watching she took the diaper
[01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:56.200]  off and there was blood coming out of the baby's vaginal area the CPS is so
[01:33:56.200 --> 01:34:00.120]  hellish they do so ladies and gentlemen and now there's a sheriff's deputy
[01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:04.600]  behind them a sheriff's deputy in front of them they're going to the hospital
[01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:07.800]  again if you just joined us this is dealing with the New Hampshire case
[01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:11.880]  where last Thursday they seized this family's newborn baby and put in the
[01:34:11.880 --> 01:34:19.360]  affidavit that's public that it was supposedly because he had been
[01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:22.480]  affiliated with Oath Keepers and he just put on their message boards they were
[01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:27.520]  surveilling him and this is so incredible there's a big protest tomorrow
[01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:33.160]  there outside of the court we go to him now in the car being followed by the
[01:34:33.160 --> 01:34:37.840]  police going to the hospital the baby in the ambulance this is incredible Mr.
[01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:42.000]  Irish tell us exactly what happened well I'm actually parking the truck right now
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:46.720]  to head in so I'll make it quick. Stuffy and I have scheduled visitation with Cheyenne
[01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:54.760]  our daughter at 12.30 today and when we when we're in the visit Cheyenne was
[01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:59.520]  acting very odd she was worrying me she wouldn't wake up wouldn't wake up so
[01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:03.680]  stop any part well let's try changing her diaper because sometimes when you
[01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:11.200]  change a baby they wake up immediately listen I know you've got to go in so
[01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:14.080]  just I'm sorry I missed your call 30 minutes ago quickly tell us what
[01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:21.360]  happened. Stephanie started changing the diaper and when Stephanie changed the
[01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:26.640]  diaper there was blood in her diaper covering her vaginal area smeared
[01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:32.320]  around her vaginal area. Now it's key the CPS was there correct because they
[01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:38.560]  might try to blame you. Correct. But they were in the room. Correct. And you
[01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:44.080]  said what is this? Yeah I said what is this what's going on and the same people W workers
[01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:52.480]  charged robbed. I mean per charge robbed. Oh no where's the crew. They know they screwed up.

[01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:21.920]  soon as you can call us or they may try to set you up be very very careful.
[01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:25.920]  Everything's reported. I'll call you back Alex. Thank you. All right thank you. Oh my god.
[01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:36.000]  And you know two months ago when she was seven and a half months pregnant
[01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:42.960]  two and a half months ago and I've looked at the records they were waiting at their home
[01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:48.960]  at least what was it four or six police cars and he just had his wisdom teeth taken out
[01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:54.880]  and she's driving the car she has a concealed carry and they go and get them out of the car
[01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:57.840]  they take the gun out and they say well we're going to arrest you you've got a concealed
[01:36:57.840 --> 01:37:01.520]  carry without a permit and they live for your die state and they took him to jail
[01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:06.880]  and we know that Homeland Security we have the documents I covered it
[01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:13.520]  earlier in the week in fact guys will you dig into the stack from Monday or from Friday that
[01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:18.320]  has that Homeland Security report how the Southern Parvy Law Center it now runs it
[01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:23.200]  and they admit they're infiltrating teachers psychiatrists psychologists not just police
[01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:28.480]  as they've always done neighbors that was on Austin News last week to spy on everyone
[01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:33.680]  and to persecute anybody that's in a patriot group and to demonize them and it looks like
[01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:39.280]  this family was targeted Mr. Iris comes off as very credible in the videos I've seen of him at
[01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:46.400]  protest his story checks out from previous MO that we've seen you know it's like serial killers
[01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:53.120]  tend to act the same well I know how the CPS operates I got a huge headache when I got that
[01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:54.320]  call and learned that during the break
[01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:02.400]  and he's shook up right now that's why he obviously called my cell that was in there
[01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:07.440]  plugged in instead of calling the hotline send him a text because he's pretty pretty shook up
[01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:12.080]  we'll send another and remind him this is the number to call and and he may have tried we
[01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:13.760]  have the ringer on and on the hotline right
[01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:23.520]  Hamed ghoul was on the hotline that is what happened but we have two hotline numbers
[01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:30.320]  perhaps we just sending both hotlines my fault I told you to send him the hotline two days ago
[01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:32.640]  but I didn't think of that eventuality
[01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:44.080]  but even if Jonathan Irish is the devil which I don't think he is but nobody's perfect
[01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:47.760]  with all these fake allegations about abuse and things his wife says are completely made up
[01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:53.520]  that's what happens with divorces and things you know she was divorcing her ex-husband
[01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:58.800]  that's where all this stem from starting with the gun that I've seen this over and over again
[01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:05.280]  but even if he was a horrible guy you don't put in there because oathkeepers and he's into the
[01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:11.200]  second amendment and that's in the affidavit that's the issue this political persecution
[01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:18.160]  text him that as soon as it'll probably be in the middle of the next hour
[01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:21.520]  but as soon as he gets five minutes as soon as the baby's in
[01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:27.600]  I hope they don't try to keep him and his wife away because there's no telling what they'll do
[01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:35.520]  I mean they've got ghouls the general hospital will be good but then they have special little
[01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:42.320]  units of like Jonathan Irish you've called us back on the hotline what's the latest
[01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:57.920]  okay you need to get someone that has your power of attorney family or or or or or or or some type
[01:39:57.920 --> 01:40:02.960]  of quote guardian as a witness to what they're doing but but but this is so important when you
[01:40:02.960 --> 01:40:06.960]  got visitation you have because I know that how this works the cps is always in the room with you
[01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:13.280]  you they were there and because they're going to try to blame this on you but but you
[01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:21.600]  they were there the entire time correct and that is key you know these people I don't want to get
[01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:26.400]  into descriptions here but it's a baby this is a medical issue but how much blood did it look
[01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:32.160]  like there had been any trauma I couldn't look like there had been a little bit of trauma but
[01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:38.640]  I'm not a medical professional um it did it also did look like there was a little bit of inflammation
[01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:44.000]  and well they probably just never changed her diaper I mean that's standard operating procedure
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:48.960]  children are in five times more danger in cps custody than any other place uh headline cover
[01:40:49.520 --> 01:40:55.360]  time magazine the shame of foster care uh 1999 issue sorry go ahead well there was
[01:40:56.160 --> 01:41:01.920]  there was also blood smeared around her entire her entire area down there as well oh my gosh
[01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:09.760]  I mean so the baby's out of it the baby's non responsive she keeps popping in and out well
[01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:14.720]  here's the key here's the key babies need to start they lose weight the first day they need to start
[01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:21.280]  gaining weight by the second or third day the key what you must demand is they must you must be
[01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:27.040]  given the chart of the weight of that baby that will be the pure evidence of their evil if that
[01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:35.360]  baby who is now uh almost seven days old uh born Wednesday night correct correct so about to be
[01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:41.360]  seven days just a few hours short maybe 10 hours short of seven days if that baby has not gained
[01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:49.040]  substantive weight they have had continual custody and their abuse is on record we have them if that
[01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:58.160]  is the case the weight is the key Jonathan do you understand correct okay could you please get the
[01:41:58.160 --> 01:42:01.600]  police the sheriff not the police officer the sheriff as he's been stuck in county is here in
[01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:06.320]  knows I'm supposed to be back there okay sheriff as he has more power than that sergeant right there
[01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:11.120]  for whatever imagine I'm having I want to speak with sergeant as he's a sheriff as he's please
[01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:17.920]  sheriff as he knows I'm supposed to be back there no no ma'am I want to be back with my daughter now

[01:42:53.520 --> 01:43:00.080]  basically submit yourself and and just and just calmly and lovingly say listen my daughter
[01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:06.560]  has obviously been hurt you know in your custody I don't I have a right to be a witness to what's

[01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:18.320]  got to leave this this may have been an entire setup I'm telling you they're that evil you're
[01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:24.320]  you're not allowing me to videotape this for my protection no you know they just told me I'm not
[01:43:24.320 --> 01:43:28.640]  allowed to videotape this for my protection and this is what what Douglas security telling you this
[01:43:28.640 --> 01:43:36.560]  okay well you need to tell him that you are tell him that you are not being filmed you are
[01:43:36.560 --> 01:43:40.880]  so everything is locked to that door no I'm not I just turned the videotape the video camera on
[01:43:40.880 --> 01:43:46.480]  when you came through I wanted to see my daughter okay the school you go into the car as long as you

[01:44:18.400 --> 01:44:22.960]  Jonathan there is a percept Jonathan I know you're protecting yourself so I think you're covered
[01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:32.800]  but it's a gray area there is not a perception of it doesn't matter I'm talking it is a private
[01:44:32.800 --> 01:44:40.960]  facility so there is the expectation of privacy so don't videotape it okay I'm not I'm not sorry
[01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:46.400]  I shut the video camera off okay good that's smart okay because they would have probably arrested
[01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:52.000]  you if you wouldn't have it's a gray area because they're because they're videotaping you and you
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:57.760]  have a reason to be there uh but obviously they're nervous so so there's no outside there's no
[01:44:57.760 --> 01:45:03.840]  perception of of privacy there is inside there partially yeah all right I'll call you guys back

[01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:47.680]  look at how everything's coming down right now we've got to be strong through this depression
[01:46:47.680 --> 01:46:51.440]  that's coming now I know it's hard for people but for all you wealthy people out there that
[01:46:51.440 --> 01:46:56.320]  sit there on your hands why is it always the poor I notice that give and not the wealthy the wealthy
[01:46:56.320 --> 01:47:00.320]  people who believe in what we're doing here and believe in this need to give to us and that means
[01:47:00.320 --> 01:47:05.840]  call it by a thousand copies of in-game or invisible empire or obama deception and give them to people
[01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:12.960]  that's what you do it's time for everybody to chip in here all right I'm going to go to break
[01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:18.080]  playing this video and then I'm going to come back and get into it I've just got a every once in a
[01:47:18.080 --> 01:47:23.920]  while something gives me is really I go past angry and just tired of it and I get a pounding headache
[01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:29.360]  and once or twice a year I have a migraine migraine related to this and I'm going to be
[01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:32.720]  knocked out for a couple hours if I have one rolling around the ground throwing up so
[01:47:32.720 --> 01:47:37.440]  I'm going to uh because it feels like I'm getting a migraine go ahead and go to the tape and I'll
[01:47:37.440 --> 01:47:50.080]  be back we have in washington dc's is too big and you can hardly solve the problem of a government
[01:47:50.080 --> 01:47:56.400]  too big by making it bigger that makes no sense whatsoever you know we're in this economic crisis
[01:47:56.400 --> 01:48:02.400]  because we spent too much money we didn't have we borrowed too much money we regulated too much and
[01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:09.120]  we printed too much so the predictable crisis arrives austrian free market economists predicted
[01:48:09.120 --> 01:48:14.240]  for years we have a bubble out there there's a housing bubble there's a nasdik bubble and
[01:48:14.240 --> 01:48:20.640]  something bad is coming and uh when it comes uh what do the people in charge say do they come to
[01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:25.760]  the economists who made all the correct predictions and said it was coming and understood what was
[01:48:25.760 --> 01:48:31.840]  wrong do they come to them and ask them what to do no what they do is they spend more money they
[01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:36.800]  borrow more money they print more money and they come up with more regulations and they think it's
[01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:50.960]  going to help i say we need to do the opposite the opposite means that we have to start from
[01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:55.360]  scratch we have to start from scratch and deciding what the role of our government should be
[01:48:55.360 --> 01:48:59.600]  the founders went through that they didn't like the role of the government under the king they said
[01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:03.680]  the role of government should be different the role of government ought to be there to protect
[01:49:03.680 --> 01:49:08.160]  our liberties the role of government ought to be there to provide a strong national defense the
[01:49:08.160 --> 01:49:14.800]  role for the government ought to be given us a sound currency not a bunch or a few people in secret
[01:49:14.800 --> 01:49:20.320]  rooms that have monopoly control over the money supply and the interest rates that's not in the
[01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:31.760]  constitution so how did how did we get into this mess the people were complacent the congress
[01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:38.320]  voted things that weren't constitutional and we drifted because the wealth created by free markets
[01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:44.720]  and free people was so overwhelming that we lived off our wealth for so long and the world trusted
[01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:51.280]  us they trusted our dollars they trusted our military power and the momentum continued to go
[01:49:51.280 --> 01:49:57.520]  even after we failed at understanding what real liberty means so what did we do we didn't want
[01:49:57.520 --> 01:50:03.520]  to cut back like a family or a business has to do the country as a whole just went on a borrowing
[01:50:04.080 --> 01:50:13.280]  binge and therefore we now are suffering from the prosperity that has accumulated uh with with
[01:50:13.280 --> 01:50:19.520]  debt so it's not real prosperity if you're in trouble and i say well the solution is go out and buy
[01:50:19.520 --> 01:50:24.800]  a fancy new car and you're going to feel better nobody does that except in washington they go out
[01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:30.080]  and they spend money and think that the world the country is going to feel better it's absolutely
[01:50:30.080 --> 01:50:35.360]  the wrong thing to do free market economics teaches that if the government in particular
[01:50:35.360 --> 01:50:42.480]  the federal reserve produces bubbles and gets the economy out of whack you have to allow corrections
[01:50:42.480 --> 01:50:48.960]  to occur you have to liquidate the debt okay they sort of paid attention to that a little bit yeah
[01:50:48.960 --> 01:50:53.920]  who there is too much debt the banks have too much debt the mortgage companies have too much debt
[01:50:53.920 --> 01:50:58.880]  fanny main freddy mac has too much debt there's too much derivative debt so what did they do
[01:50:58.880 --> 01:51:03.680]  they took all the debt hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite are now

[01:53:54.960 --> 01:54:04.240]  freeze dry guy the best you can buy they have to allow corrections to occur you have to liquidate
[01:54:04.240 --> 01:54:10.160]  the debt okay they sort of paid attention to that a little bit yeah who there is too much debt the
[01:54:10.160 --> 01:54:14.720]  banks have too much debt the mortgage companies have too much debt Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac has too
[01:54:14.720 --> 01:54:20.560]  much debt there's too much derivative debt so what did they do they took all the debt put it
[01:54:20.560 --> 01:54:25.120]  in the Federal Reserve and in the Treasury and put it on the taxpayers that's criminal
[01:54:30.640 --> 01:54:37.360]  eventually though all debt has to be liquidated we are not likely matter of fact it's virtually
[01:54:37.360 --> 01:54:44.640]  impossible for we as a people to pay to pay this astronomical debt which is growing exponentially
[01:54:44.640 --> 01:54:50.720]  so unfortunately the bad message is it's going to end badly because the debt will be liquidated
[01:54:50.720 --> 01:54:54.800]  that doesn't mean it'll be liquidated like you would liquidate your debt if you had to go through
[01:54:54.800 --> 01:55:00.560]  bankruptcy file for bankruptcy and debt would be dissipated and it'd be liquidated countries don't
[01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:06.560]  do that they're much more corrupt and they kind of fit their way out of it they print money and
[01:55:06.560 --> 01:55:12.880]  pay off their debts with money with shrinking value that is essentially how we got into this mess
[01:55:13.440 --> 01:55:20.160]  we cannot we could not have gotten ourselves into this mess without a central bank that had so much
[01:55:20.160 --> 01:55:25.760]  power and authority the central bank especially the the chairman of the board is more powerful than
[01:55:25.760 --> 01:55:31.120]  the president because he gets to print create the reserve currency of the world determine how
[01:55:31.120 --> 01:55:36.480]  much money suppliers should be in the world and what interest rates should be that's way too much
[01:55:36.480 --> 01:55:43.200]  power he is a counterfeiter and he is a taxer because if the congress passes money that passes
[01:55:43.200 --> 01:55:48.960]  bill and they don't have the money the fed prints the money your prices go up that's a tax on us
[01:55:48.960 --> 01:56:03.680]  it's it's the wrong thing to do and it has to stop defending the republic from enemies foreign and
[01:56:03.680 --> 01:56:14.160]  domestic it's alex jones and ron poll goes on in the speech and we have time next hour we're
[01:56:14.160 --> 01:56:19.760]  going to play it it's a 22 minute speech he goes on to point out that we are going to completely
[01:56:19.760 --> 01:56:28.720]  collapse and he talks about what that will be like and we have the article up at prisonplanet.com
[01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:38.800]  ron poll dollar collapse will spur 2012 presidential run congressman ron poll has indicated that he
[01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:43.840]  will embark on a bid to become president in 2012 with the economic crisis worsens and leads to a
[01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:49.120]  dollar collapse hinting for the first time that the ron poll revolution which was a grassroots
[01:56:49.120 --> 01:56:55.600]  precursor the tea party will once again be ignited as it was with great fervor in 2008 but
[01:56:55.600 --> 01:57:01.120]  but to the power of 10 events can change quickly and i believe sincerely we're moving towards a
[01:57:01.120 --> 01:57:07.360]  much more major economic crisis depending on where we are on that might help me make that decision
[01:57:07.360 --> 01:57:13.280]  said paul who gave a speech to tea party enthusiast in richmond virginia this past weekend that's what
[01:57:13.280 --> 01:57:18.320]  he's told me privately so i guess i can tell you know just like during the breaks we talk and stuff
[01:57:18.320 --> 01:57:21.680]  and he's like well it depends on what happens you know i know this is going to collapse but people
[01:57:21.680 --> 01:57:25.680]  may not be able to totally wake up until it happens and you know then it'll be four more years and i
[01:57:25.680 --> 01:57:31.040]  might be too old uh but at least we got ron poll and others and now the truth's out there and no
[01:57:31.040 --> 01:57:35.600]  army can stop an idea whose time has come you know i analyzed during that six seven minute
[01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:40.720]  break i took because i every once in a while something will really make me get upset and
[01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:45.840]  instead of getting angry i got a headache and i know why i was imaging them with that baby
[01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:51.440]  that they haven't been able to see for almost seven days they're there with the cps the baby is
[01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:55.920]  basically passed out probably dehydrated lord knows what they've done it's standard operating
[01:57:55.920 --> 01:57:59.840]  procedure these are because after they screw the babies up and they put drugs on them they give them
[01:57:59.840 --> 01:58:03.280]  medical conditions then they get more federal funds i mean they're devils usually with a
[01:58:03.280 --> 01:58:06.240]  blonde hair blue eyed one though they take pretty good care of them because they just want the
[01:58:06.240 --> 01:58:13.600]  400 to half a mil they're going to get through the adoption racket but um i was imaging that
[01:58:13.600 --> 01:58:19.200]  as if it was my child i mean i have intense empathy and i was just really it took me there and
[01:58:20.080 --> 01:58:27.040]  and just the frustration the anger in fact in fact i'm it's like a place i can't go it's
[01:58:28.240 --> 01:58:33.280]  people say how do you stay sane dealing with us every day it's survival instinct i mean i
[01:58:33.280 --> 01:58:37.760]  realize we either fight these people and wake people up and defeat the globalists or i mean
[01:58:37.760 --> 01:58:48.160]  it's our only way out it's our only hope this is gcn the genesis communications radio network

[02:01:14.560 --> 02:01:21.200]  that's what it's all about and that's what we are attempting to do i do have a mortgage expert
[02:01:21.200 --> 02:01:24.480]  and i've studied this for more than a decade i mean i've known about the mortgage fraud and
[02:01:24.480 --> 02:01:32.560]  many guest on and covered it the problem is there are a lot of charlatans out there who that's why
[02:01:32.560 --> 02:01:38.480]  i've never really allowed on my show sometimes stations or sometimes even the network but
[02:01:38.480 --> 02:01:42.240]  then they sometimes have problems and get rid of them because you know even supposedly
[02:01:43.440 --> 02:01:48.400]  reputable groups that i hear on rush limbaugh and glenbeck and other shows you know you learn about
[02:01:48.400 --> 02:01:51.760]  them promising we can help fix your mortgage we can help get it into court for you and then
[02:01:51.760 --> 02:01:59.360]  you take a bunch of money from you and don't really help them but i do know a gentleman
[02:01:59.360 --> 02:02:02.880]  who i've actually had on once before and i've been listening to him off and on for years and
[02:02:02.880 --> 02:02:08.480]  looking into his research and it's been spot on his analysis of their frauds the the cornucopia
[02:02:08.480 --> 02:02:13.600]  of the spectrum of scams the banks are running and ways to counter them and in systems that are
[02:02:13.600 --> 02:02:18.400]  being successful so he's going to pop in for 30 minutes he's randy kelton uh at the bottom of the
[02:02:18.400 --> 02:02:22.960]  hour and he's going to be in studio he's on the road right now doing seminars all over the country
[02:02:22.960 --> 02:02:27.040]  he's going to be in studio next week for two hours to go over it in more detail with all the
[02:02:27.040 --> 02:02:31.600]  documents and some of you say well i don't have a bad mortgage or i'm running why do i care well
[02:02:31.600 --> 02:02:37.920]  you better care about banks that are able to engage in mass fraud not just here but worldwide
[02:02:37.920 --> 02:02:43.360]  selling mortgages sometimes 10 20 30 times usually three or four times uh cheating people
[02:02:43.360 --> 02:02:50.720]  stealing their escrow not having the deed foreclosing on houses uh that uh are paid for and that they
[02:02:50.720 --> 02:02:55.040]  don't even have a deed to and i'm i played this a few months ago but well you guys youtube because
[02:02:55.040 --> 02:02:57.920]  we never played it this week when i called for i don't know if you could find it um
[02:03:00.880 --> 02:03:07.680]  it was a cnn uh bank takes house that was paid for or bank takes house they didn't own
[02:03:07.680 --> 02:03:11.760]  and and and we could pull up mainstream news articles you know about it happening in europe
[02:03:11.760 --> 02:03:17.120]  and here and in canada uh but but you know there's something about cnn actually with the family in
[02:03:17.120 --> 02:03:21.280]  fact we ought to get them on but it's happening a bunch we get these calls all the time it's like
[02:03:21.280 --> 02:03:27.040]  my house been paid for for 10 years and they and they just came and said they foreclosed on it and
[02:03:27.040 --> 02:03:32.320]  took it and the court won't help me i mean it the courts are involved in this corruption so
[02:03:32.320 --> 02:03:40.000]  there's a spectrum of corruption going on a wide spectrum of it and it just goes to the total and
[02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:51.600]  complete mad dog uh crazy uh level of all of this that is uh happening in our country and around the
[02:03:51.600 --> 02:03:58.880]  world it's just i mean i know a lot of people just when you talk about any type of corruption
[02:03:58.880 --> 02:04:03.600]  even if it's publicly admitted they all that's not true because you just as a normal person who's not
[02:04:03.600 --> 02:04:11.840]  evil who's not a scam artist who doesn't think about scams who who the bible has a verse about
[02:04:15.280 --> 02:04:20.560]  they run around continually inventing new forms of evil
[02:04:23.120 --> 02:04:28.880]  in fact will you guys look for that bible verse um they they they run around continually
[02:04:28.880 --> 02:04:33.120]  inventing new evils and and that's what the globalists do they found the cnn article let's
[02:04:33.120 --> 02:04:40.800]  pop it back up good job here's the cnn article uh it says embattled homeowner to bank you don't
[02:04:40.800 --> 02:04:51.600]  own my loan uh and that was uh october 12th so that's yesterday yeah yeah no that's just where
[02:04:51.600 --> 02:04:57.360]  they don't own the loan their cnn reports where the house is paid for and they don't own the loan

[02:09:39.280 --> 02:09:50.800]  will spur 2012 presidential run we covered that uh here is the bbc obama will not ban home repossessions
[02:09:50.800 --> 02:10:04.720]  fraud okay continuing here the white house has ruled out a temporary ban on the repossession of homes
[02:10:04.720 --> 02:10:10.560]  despite a growing row i guess in england that means a fight over alleged malpractice see
[02:10:10.560 --> 02:10:14.400]  they're just oh they're just a few little problems and they're hoping that everyone uh
[02:10:14.400 --> 02:10:21.760]  basically you know doesn't even look into any of this uh it says amid claims that shoddy paperwork
[02:10:21.760 --> 02:10:29.600]  led to wrongful repossessions calls have grown for a nationwide moratorium but a white house
[02:10:29.600 --> 02:10:34.720]  spokesman said this could have unintended consequences last week bank of america said it
[02:10:34.720 --> 02:10:41.040]  would extend its ban on sales of repossessed homes until 23 us states uh to all 50 and we're
[02:10:41.040 --> 02:10:45.760]  going to be covering this more but the next segment will finish this complete video now and get more
[02:10:45.760 --> 02:10:50.640]  into what's happening with gold then randy kelton gives us a a little preview what is he
[02:10:50.640 --> 02:10:55.200]  be covering in studio with us next week i think three is the charm here's the video
[02:10:59.440 --> 02:11:05.200]  i want to ask you a question what media organization can you think of in the world
[02:11:05.200 --> 02:11:11.200]  that's having a bigger effect than actually waking people up to hardcore issues sure ron paul is
[02:11:11.200 --> 02:11:15.600]  wonderful he talks about the private federal reserve and the inflation tax and the imploding
[02:11:15.600 --> 02:11:21.120]  economy that's being engineered by the central bankers but when it comes to media who will really
[02:11:21.120 --> 02:11:27.840]  tell it like it is and who has woken more people up the answer is info wars dot com and that's
[02:11:27.840 --> 02:11:33.360]  because you the listeners of my broadcast in the last 15 years will be slowly built and grew this
[02:11:33.360 --> 02:11:39.120]  platform to get the message of true freedom and sovereignty out have continued to spread the word
[02:11:39.120 --> 02:11:44.720]  about the transmission we're not funded with federal government product placement or propaganda
[02:11:44.720 --> 02:11:52.480]  placement or behavior placement money as fox cnn msnbc abcr on record with billions of dollars
[02:11:52.480 --> 02:11:58.240]  a year of federal money we're not supported by the big mega corporations that want the new world
[02:11:58.240 --> 02:12:03.520]  order that is a giant collectivized corporate slave system we don't have that support we have
[02:12:03.520 --> 02:12:10.080]  your support we are truly grassroots and everything we've talked about unfortunately is coming true
[02:12:10.080 --> 02:12:13.840]  i wish we'd been wrong but we were only following the globalist own documents that were public
[02:12:14.480 --> 02:12:20.960]  and so we've been proven right and as we go into this critical juncture this critical time in 2010
[02:12:20.960 --> 02:12:28.480]  2011 as we look forward we realize here at info wars dot com my syndicated radio show and the
[02:12:28.480 --> 02:12:33.280]  websites and the films that we've got to kick it into the next gear the next level we've got to
[02:12:33.280 --> 02:12:39.520]  give our maximum effort against tyranny there is a huge awakening taking place just this week
[02:12:40.080 --> 02:12:45.360]  it came out that all the conspiracy theorists were right that most of the big mortgage companies
[02:12:45.360 --> 02:12:49.920]  and major banks have been engaged in fraud even repossessing homes that they didn't even have the
[02:12:49.920 --> 02:12:56.080]  deed to and that were paid off now they're suspending most foreclosure around the country
[02:12:56.080 --> 02:13:00.080]  five major banks have completely suspended it including the biggest mortgage holder
[02:13:00.080 --> 02:13:05.920]  bank of america but that's just one issue the dollar is plunging world government is being
[02:13:05.920 --> 02:13:11.680]  announced the answer to the crisis the banks engineered is to give them more power bottom line
[02:13:12.320 --> 02:13:16.640]  we have a responsibility to intensify our operations against the globalist
[02:13:16.640 --> 02:13:20.960]  and it's been your support of the radio show the sponsors the buying the books the t-shirts
[02:13:20.960 --> 02:13:25.920]  the films getting them out to people that has supported us over the years now we want to complete
[02:13:25.920 --> 02:13:30.880]  our tv studio we want to launch a big social network to get freedom lovers together we want
[02:13:30.880 --> 02:13:36.480]  to do so many other things like producing four films a year not just two many of my documentaries
[02:13:36.480 --> 02:13:41.200]  like the obama deception have been seen tens of millions of times for free online because you
[02:13:41.200 --> 02:13:48.160]  have supported us we are on a mission to expose the globalist their crimes are so incredible so
[02:13:48.160 --> 02:13:55.040]  transparent that if we will simply expose them and resist them and continue to say no to their
[02:13:55.040 --> 02:14:01.600]  oppression their system will fall apart and is already beginning to fall apart they are not
[02:14:01.600 --> 02:14:08.240]  invincible they're only men just like us and i believe i know that free humanity is better than
[02:14:08.240 --> 02:14:14.160]  these parasitical control freaks i know we're going to beat them but i also know we don't have a choice
[02:14:14.880 --> 02:14:20.880]  slavery isn't a choice at all i want liberty and so i'm going to fight with every ounce of my being
[02:14:20.880 --> 02:14:27.280]  of my soul of my spirit we're going to have a 24 plus hour special broadcast kicks off at 11 a.m
[02:14:27.280 --> 02:14:33.200]  central this thursday and runs through friday into the next live radio broadcast that will be live
[02:14:33.200 --> 02:14:38.640]  as well on friday and we're having the third money bomb the first money bomb started three years ago
[02:14:38.640 --> 02:14:44.400]  when listeners began the effort on their own i didn't really supported it first because i never
[02:14:44.400 --> 02:14:49.840]  really asked for donations but that money that came in that 300 000 really helped us expand
[02:14:50.640 --> 02:14:55.040]  and the second money bomb helped us move into these studios and build what we've done here
[02:14:55.040 --> 02:14:59.760]  we need this third money bomb going into this depression going into this controlled implosion
[02:14:59.760 --> 02:15:05.600]  to be even bigger so that we can complete the studios and expand the overall output of key
[02:15:05.600 --> 02:15:11.200]  information we're putting out we are going 110 percent and if you believe in what we're doing
[02:15:11.200 --> 02:15:17.120]  if you support what we're doing spread the word about the broadcast the online videos the films
[02:15:17.120 --> 02:15:22.720]  the news websites and donate whether it's five dollars or a hundred dollars every bit of that
[02:15:22.720 --> 02:15:28.160]  money bomb is going to go directly into expanding our facilities so we can challenge the corporate
[02:15:28.160 --> 02:15:34.560]  media at an even higher level my friends it is up to you the effect we're going to have
[02:15:35.120 --> 02:15:40.640]  but you've seen george soros publications like media matters and many others intensifying their
[02:15:40.640 --> 02:15:45.920]  attacks on us you've seen the adl southern poverty law center saying that i'm a menace and a danger
[02:15:45.920 --> 02:15:52.160]  the government law enforcement there are a whole set of evil agents out there uh and though i don't
[02:15:52.160 --> 02:15:56.800]  expect to see alex jones taking a shot at the many times soon there are people out there who are
[02:15:56.800 --> 02:16:02.400]  perfectly willing to do exactly that you've seen nightlife floating these highly charged ideas at
[02:16:02.400 --> 02:16:07.200]  a time when the country is already very angry and anxious that you are making things more dangerous
[02:16:07.200 --> 02:16:13.680]  you've seen msnbc when the hatred of our own elected government becomes explosive he maintains
[02:16:13.680 --> 02:16:19.920]  that he's neither far right nor far left but his appeal to the anti-government new right is palpable
[02:16:19.920 --> 02:16:26.400]  you've witnessed cnn you've seen them all coming after us i'm not calling for any offensive actions
[02:16:26.400 --> 02:16:32.160]  i'm calling like malcolm x did for people to be able to protect themselves in this country from scum
[02:16:32.160 --> 02:16:37.600]  at cnn as gondy said first they ignore you then they laugh at you then they attack you then you win
[02:16:38.320 --> 02:16:42.880]  first they ignored us then they laughed at us now they've been really attacking us
[02:16:42.880 --> 02:16:48.880]  well what comes next we're going to win it is not a foregone conclusion it is not a
[02:16:48.880 --> 02:16:53.120]  self-fulfilling prophecy that we have to give into tyranny and that's just the way it is
[02:16:53.120 --> 02:16:59.840]  resistance is victory simply standing up is victory and we've been out there on the front
[02:16:59.840 --> 02:17:05.680]  lines when msnbc uh employees are attacking us and cutting up our equipment with knives
[02:17:05.680 --> 02:17:26.720]  we have stood there and and and and taken it and resisted when the media has lied and claimed
[02:17:26.720 --> 02:17:33.280]  that we're supporting cop killers we have exposed fbi operatives like hal turner who attacked me for
[02:17:33.280 --> 02:17:38.400]  more than a decade as a federal agent and it came out in federal court he was a federal agent
[02:17:38.400 --> 02:17:44.800]  we are under attack by coantel pro by the financed fake grass roots the renomab by the corporate
[02:17:44.800 --> 02:17:50.000]  media by the think tanks the end the fed rallies that i've been at have been surveilled by the us
[02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:56.080]  army my great crew members like rob do up at the g20 last year he got arrested taken to a fema
[02:17:56.080 --> 02:18:01.680]  facility they had troops and police there and had bags over people's heads it's turning out in
[02:18:01.680 --> 02:18:06.800]  pennsylvania that an israeli company was involved in surveilling members of the legislature for
[02:18:06.800 --> 02:18:12.960]  homeland security this these are perilous times this is serious issues and i'm going to explain
[02:18:12.960 --> 02:18:19.040]  it again very simply our success is governed by our hard work our focus our determination our
[02:18:19.040 --> 02:18:24.560]  research we've got that side of the equation but the other side of the equation is you supporting
[02:18:24.560 --> 02:18:29.200]  us i know there are a lot of well-to-do people out there who have pumped their money into the
[02:18:29.200 --> 02:18:33.680]  democrats and republicans and who feel like the members of the establishment you know you're
[02:18:33.680 --> 02:18:40.320]  being targeted in this implosion you understand that we're going into a seriously authoritarian
[02:18:40.320 --> 02:18:46.480]  high-tech version of slavery and so i'm asking you the people out there uh who the federal
[02:18:46.480 --> 02:18:52.240]  government takes your money and then uses your own tax money to finance propaganda against you
[02:18:52.240 --> 02:18:58.240]  i'm asking you not at the coercive barrel of a gun like the government does but simply by asking
[02:18:58.240 --> 02:19:02.480]  that if you believe in what we're doing if you believe in the message that you see in here
[02:19:02.480 --> 02:19:08.000]  and that we're putting out or if you even believe in true alternative grassroots media
[02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:14.960]  challenging the globalist that you need to support us but whatever you do join us this

[02:33:52.960 --> 02:33:58.000]  but we had an emergency with jonathan irish and there's a protest tomorrow of course in front of
[02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:04.880]  the cps the court but they finally got to see their baby today the cps is there the baby was
[02:34:04.880 --> 02:34:08.400]  non-responsive they take the diaper off there's blood all over the place they took him to the
[02:34:08.400 --> 02:34:13.680]  hospital the doctor said take this child to a sexual abuse expert and the baby's been in the
[02:34:13.680 --> 02:34:18.080]  government's custody the entire time it's all their fault whatever they've done and this is
[02:34:18.080 --> 02:34:22.800]  standard operating procedure and somebody picked out this woman and said we want that baby and
[02:34:22.800 --> 02:34:27.600]  that's when we've had you know members of the you know state legislatures on who discovered
[02:34:27.600 --> 02:34:32.000]  they've got quotas and that's come out in the news uh but we hope that's not the case we hope it's
[02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:36.400]  just neglect that they weren't changing her diaper for you know the last five days that's how they
[02:34:36.400 --> 02:34:42.160]  roll but uh i know this is hard for you jonathan but just recap what's happened in the latest
[02:34:42.160 --> 02:34:47.840]  information well um they actually didn't send her directly to a sexual abuse specialist uh
[02:34:48.480 --> 02:34:54.080]  we're in a visitation and she wasn't responsive and stephanie um stephanie said well you know
[02:34:54.080 --> 02:34:58.000]  let's try changing a diaper because a lot of times when you change a baby's diaper in the
[02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:04.640]  sleeping they wake up so stephanie tried to wake her up and it didn't work so she started to change
[02:35:04.640 --> 02:35:09.840]  a diaper stephanie started to change her daughter shayane's diaper and shayane starts waking up and
[02:35:09.840 --> 02:35:16.080]  starts to freak out and and get really really fussy and starts to scream immediately and
[02:35:16.720 --> 02:35:23.200]  stephanie gets our daughter's diaper open and we see blood on the diaper and smeared all over
[02:35:23.200 --> 02:35:27.200]  the vaginal area okay so this is with them but to be clear because in the last segment you were
[02:35:27.200 --> 02:35:31.840]  driving and and i must have misunderstood you i thought you said the doctor said send the baby
[02:35:31.840 --> 02:35:37.440]  to a sexual assault expert correct uh the cps w worker was in there when we changed the diaper
[02:35:37.440 --> 02:35:44.000]  noticed everything the cps w worker uh immediately called the deputy sheriff the sheriff came down
[02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:51.760]  and the sheriff of strafford county came down and they sent the copy ambulance had the ambulance
[02:35:52.880 --> 02:35:58.720]  rushed our daughter shayane to the emergency room where a doctor checked her out and a doctor at
[02:35:58.720 --> 02:36:07.200]  the emergency room either lied out or lied in um made the the decision that our daughter needed to
[02:36:07.200 --> 02:36:14.720]  go down and see a sexual sexual abuse specialist doctor okay now now the cps better follow that
[02:36:14.720 --> 02:36:21.760]  directive oh they are now that our daughter is no longer in cps custody right now the sheriff's
[02:36:21.760 --> 02:36:28.640]  department has in front of us with our daughter in the back of their uh sheriff cruiser in the
[02:36:28.640 --> 02:36:34.720]  car seat with another deputy sitting directly now that all good they can smell a rat good good
[02:36:34.720 --> 02:36:40.560]  there's still some good people and have humanity well it's oh i tell you jonathan this is i pray
[02:36:40.560 --> 02:36:45.760]  for your daughter's health and safety but i tell you this is their this is bottom oh bottom lines
[02:36:45.760 --> 02:36:50.720]  something's rotten in the state of new hampshire yes sir and it's not just the state new hampshire
[02:36:50.720 --> 02:36:56.880]  it's anywhere where there's a family court anywhere where there's a cps w worker or a dcy asset well
[02:36:56.880 --> 02:37:01.040]  they're going to be in damage mode now you better have somebody with you 24 hours a day
[02:37:01.040 --> 02:37:06.720]  you better let them send people to beat you up if they do do submit to it because let me tell you
[02:37:06.720 --> 02:37:10.960]  something if this is a real criminal pervert ring we've run into and we know there are a lot of them
[02:37:10.960 --> 02:37:16.400]  it comes out all the time these people will will will put you six feet under so you've got to be
[02:37:17.280 --> 02:37:23.360]  you got to understand you are in extreme danger if this is going the direction that my gut told
[02:37:23.360 --> 02:37:31.120]  me it was going in days ago and anywhere we go we have we have at least two style phones on us
[02:37:31.120 --> 02:37:36.640]  with video capabilities and our video camera yeah but you need somebody you need a crowd with you
[02:37:36.640 --> 02:37:40.640]  two or three people that you trust they're going to try to send infiltrators in on you
[02:37:40.640 --> 02:37:44.720]  so anybody that claims they want to help you that you don't know it in certified patriot
[02:37:44.720 --> 02:37:51.120]  with years of being on record good believe me this is well look what we'll do is i'll talk to
[02:37:51.120 --> 02:37:57.680]  anything else you'd like to add not right now other than that i hope people i hope anyone who
[02:37:57.680 --> 02:38:04.720]  has not opened their eyes and and been awakened to the corruption and the serious severe disturbing
[02:38:04.720 --> 02:38:12.560]  issues with the globalists now open their eyes because of the fact it is on record that we had
[02:38:12.560 --> 02:38:19.280]  nothing to do with this other than finding finding out this this issue without good and and and and
[02:38:19.280 --> 02:38:24.800]  to be clear that's on record and the police did you see the exchange when they said we're taking
[02:38:24.800 --> 02:38:32.800]  custody of the baby from cps yes i did what happened with that um the sheriff's department said that
[02:38:32.800 --> 02:38:38.960]  because of these these situations and because of because we cannot confirm what did or did not happen
[02:38:38.960 --> 02:38:45.200]  the the child is we will take custody and care of the child from here which means they're looking
[02:38:45.200 --> 02:38:54.880]  at the cps as the culprits not necessarily cps itself but at least definitely at least be foster
[02:38:54.880 --> 02:39:01.760]  family a matter of fact i do believe because the foster the foster home where our stephanie and
[02:39:01.760 --> 02:39:09.040]  my daughter is uh is being taken care of is where stephanie's two minor sons are where we also have
[02:39:09.040 --> 02:39:16.320]  documented proof of abuse in the past and well yeah i mean there are some good foster families
[02:39:16.320 --> 02:39:22.480]  that are run by christians but a lot of time and i i cleaned carpets folks for four or five months
[02:39:22.480 --> 02:39:27.760]  so i in college went into a lot of houses and i was like what are these places and it'd be like
[02:39:27.760 --> 02:39:33.280]  always fat pedophiles with like 10 kids in a house living in squalor and that was the foster home
[02:39:33.280 --> 02:39:37.760]  and okay all right all right we may have to go into overdrive with you in 20 minutes i've got to get
[02:39:37.760 --> 02:39:41.840]  to randy kelton continue to gather more data we're going to call you back before this hour ends

[02:39:55.840 --> 02:39:59.840]  all right i apologize to randy kelton but he understands as being a radio host himself this
[02:39:59.840 --> 02:40:05.600]  type of thing uh happens uh look i haven't weighed into the mortgage thing in in the last 12 years
[02:40:05.600 --> 02:40:08.960]  since since i became aware of the massive fraud because i just would have been studying it it's
[02:40:08.960 --> 02:40:13.040]  so complex and i know there are a lot of groups out there and people that say send me ten thousand
[02:40:13.040 --> 02:40:18.000]  dollars i'll fix your mortgage overnight if you hear that don't walk run and i love that randy
[02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:23.440]  says that randy you know has been beaten up by the police over and over again put criminal charges
[02:40:23.440 --> 02:40:28.080]  on judges police one cases helped a lot of people none of it's perfect because the courts are so
[02:40:28.080 --> 02:40:33.360]  corrupt but i've heard him really go through the laundry list of different frauds that the big
[02:40:33.360 --> 02:40:37.120]  mortgage companies engage in and notice the whole house of cards is falling right now
[02:40:37.120 --> 02:40:44.640]  you know i mean even bbc uh has the headline here saying obama will not ban home repossession fraud
[02:40:45.360 --> 02:40:50.480]  so the media here is like oh well they're stopping all the you know the bank of america another big
[02:40:50.480 --> 02:40:55.280]  bank uh foreclosures so there's a few paperwork problems and things today just briefly i want to
[02:40:55.280 --> 02:40:59.360]  give you a prelude and in fact we'll just talk about it right now with randy kelton uh who is a
[02:40:59.360 --> 02:41:04.160]  you know pro se uh you know guys good as many top lawyers i know and he specializes in a lot of
[02:41:04.160 --> 02:41:09.520]  different areas that's why a lot of lawyers are learning from him uh and uh you know i've got a
[02:41:09.520 --> 02:41:12.960]  great corporate lawyer bankruptcy lawyer he's an expert in that not that we've ever done that but
[02:41:12.960 --> 02:41:17.040]  that's what he and i've talked to him about the stuff years ago he knows about the mortgage stuff
[02:41:17.040 --> 02:41:22.880]  so a lot of this dovetails with the research of randy kelton uh and uh randy i just in the
[02:41:22.880 --> 02:41:27.360]  in a little bit of time we have today uh number one let's pick a time for you to come on next week

[02:41:36.400 --> 02:41:42.640]  well let's get the head producer in here of all my great crew jaren nyhart jaren look at the big
[02:41:42.640 --> 02:41:49.840]  board in there uh let's get randy on wednesday one to five we'll do two hours of overdrive we'll
[02:41:49.840 --> 02:41:54.720]  do three hours with randy uh one hour main radio transmission and two hours overdrive
[02:41:54.720 --> 02:41:58.080]  wednesday one o'clock uh be here randy and of course you know our location
[02:41:58.080 --> 02:42:01.120]  is a secret because we'll come and tell prosa we'll give you the directions but don't bring
[02:42:01.120 --> 02:42:06.000]  anybody okay absolutely okay you're awesome randy's a great guy okay i know you were just
[02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:10.000]  hearing that horror about the cps you want to briefly comment on that from all your research
[02:42:10.720 --> 02:42:16.240]  yes i hate to hate to come in behind that and interrupt it because i'm a grandfather myself
[02:42:16.880 --> 02:42:23.680]  and that kind of thing touches my heart and i would very much like to get a hold of this person i
[02:42:23.680 --> 02:42:30.320]  have someone in north carolina who's a private investigator that specializes in this sort of
[02:42:30.320 --> 02:42:37.680]  thing who can go in and show him everything that that the child protective services should be doing
[02:42:38.240 --> 02:42:43.200]  and look at what they are doing and show them what they've done wrong and give him some tools
[02:42:43.200 --> 02:42:49.200]  to extricate his family from this mess because when they break procedures and break laws as they do
[02:42:49.200 --> 02:42:55.760]  out of hand because of an ignorant public they're blindsided when somebody actually has eyes exactly
[02:42:55.760 --> 02:43:03.680]  it and we can show him how to land on them like a ton of bricks all right randy briefly in a minute
[02:43:03.680 --> 02:43:09.120]  or two tell people how you got into your overall study of the law i mean i'll i'll give you an
[02:43:09.120 --> 02:43:16.880]  example andrew jackson our president uh in the 18 early 1830s you know the war captain the hero that
[02:43:16.880 --> 02:43:22.880]  i mean it makes a cone in the barbarian look like a wimp and he was real okay but his his as some
[02:43:22.880 --> 02:43:30.080]  fool sent me an email saying um alex you said concentration camps began uh in the colonies
[02:43:30.080 --> 02:43:35.120]  during the war with the british they began the bore war the official name concentration camp
[02:43:35.120 --> 02:43:39.360]  but i've had the top ut historian on he wrote the best-selling book about andrew jackson it's a
[02:43:39.360 --> 02:43:44.720]  concentration camp to take his mother and his brothers and lock them up in a facility with
[02:43:44.720 --> 02:43:49.920]  the thousands of other people till they starve to death okay but but side issue andrew i apologize
[02:43:49.920 --> 02:43:56.720]  randy uh andrew jackson just went down after he you know his family all died in the war he was a
[02:43:56.720 --> 02:44:02.720]  sniper and and and runner when he was 11 starting in the war andrew jackson went uh and uh he went
[02:44:02.720 --> 02:44:07.200]  to the coast i think it was george i'm going from memory and he apprenticed as a lawyer and then he
[02:44:07.200 --> 02:44:11.680]  went before the state bar and they said yeah you know everything go you're a lawyer so see that's
[02:44:11.680 --> 02:44:16.320]  the other big lie if you really study things you can get the same knowledge they have and more
[02:44:16.320 --> 02:44:20.400]  and they don't even teach real law now in most of the law schools because they don't want real
[02:44:20.400 --> 02:44:25.280]  lawyers they want procedural clerks that follow uh the uniform commercial code but i'm going to
[02:44:25.280 --> 02:44:31.760]  shut up now randy you've got the floor uh just briefly go over the lies and the fraud of the
[02:44:31.760 --> 02:44:36.400]  mortgage company some of the most popular things that they've done that's now bringing them down
[02:44:36.400 --> 02:44:46.800]  okay most people think that when a mortgage company whitesay a loan a mortgage that they give out
[02:44:46.800 --> 02:44:54.880]  their money and they want you to pay the money back not true they give out the money and then
[02:44:54.880 --> 02:45:00.560]  they take the note you sign for them and they sell it so they get all of their money back
[02:45:00.560 --> 02:45:08.560]  it is in the lender's best interest to create a note you're sure to default on
[02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:17.040]  the reason for that is if the lender prompt profits at every term and a fraudulent contract
[02:45:17.040 --> 02:45:24.320]  is not a contract it's not a contract it's if they are equitable equitable a stop will apply
[02:45:24.320 --> 02:45:30.880]  to a contract created by fraud and everything about its fraud is far too much to go into
[02:45:30.880 --> 02:45:37.280]  in these few minutes but everything is fraud it's been very carefully crafted so every step
[02:45:37.280 --> 02:45:41.200]  okay well let's take this one randy let's take this one it's you you can search the term and
[02:45:41.200 --> 02:45:45.040]  pull up mainstream news articles and i get countless calls where people go my house was
[02:45:45.040 --> 02:45:49.600]  paid for five years ago ten years ago i bought it for a hundred thousand twenty five years ago
[02:45:49.600 --> 02:45:54.800]  uh it's now worth a million on taxes and they just suddenly took it and i went to the police
[02:45:54.800 --> 02:45:58.480]  and said it was fraud and they didn't help me well i mean of course they did they don't even
[02:45:58.480 --> 02:46:03.280]  understand it what is this we're even seeing on cnn for those that can't believe this it's real
[02:46:03.280 --> 02:46:07.280]  you can pull it up we pulled it up earlier where they just take paid for houses or houses where
[02:46:07.280 --> 02:46:13.280]  they don't even have the deed that's because they've they've screwed up the system so bad
[02:46:13.280 --> 02:46:21.360]  had nobody knows who owns what they took your note they sold it to this investor this investor
[02:46:21.360 --> 02:46:29.600]  grouped your note in with five thousand others and then sold pieces as investments to uh long
[02:46:29.600 --> 02:46:35.840]  term investment pools like uh retirement funds and then they had four or five of them and once
[02:46:35.840 --> 02:46:41.840]  producing good once producing slow so they did what they call credit default swaps they swap part
[02:46:41.840 --> 02:46:47.200]  of this one for that other one so that the one doing good they didn't have to pay tax on and to
[02:46:47.200 --> 02:46:51.760]  bring up the other one just to the point they don't have to be paid taxes on it so they shifted
[02:46:51.760 --> 02:46:58.000]  these back and forth who owns that property just got lost in all this shuffling back and forth
[02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:03.840]  and then some bank comes to the court and says oh we want to repossess on this house and the bank
[02:47:03.840 --> 02:47:07.840]  is letting them when they can't prove they hold title and they don't even have the paperwork the
[02:47:07.840 --> 02:47:14.320]  deed it's just in a derivative stew of of fraud they just say well it says i own it and you're
[02:47:14.320 --> 02:47:20.800]  like my house is paid for i mean this isn't just people a lot worse than that yeah because you can't
[02:47:20.800 --> 02:47:28.160]  trace the the title back to the original land grant someone's likely to come along next year or five
[02:47:28.160 --> 02:47:35.440]  years from now and say hey wait a minute i hold the title to this place this will create a an
[02:47:35.440 --> 02:47:40.880]  incredible mess that'll follow this country from generations if we don't stop the bank
[02:47:40.880 --> 02:47:44.560]  well that already happens with people that own ranches and things in texas i read about it all
[02:47:44.560 --> 02:47:49.200]  the time they might have had it in their family a hundred years but summer railroad had the grant
[02:47:49.200 --> 02:47:53.360]  before and their great great great great granddaddy didn't file it right at the courthouse so they're
[02:47:53.360 --> 02:48:02.320]  taking it yeah and now this becomes an issue to where every house is subject to this if this
[02:48:02.320 --> 02:48:08.480]  happened this country became one of a mecca for investment because people in foreign countries
[02:48:08.480 --> 02:48:15.520]  could come to this country and buy property and be sure it was theirs now after this mess nobody
[02:48:15.520 --> 02:48:20.880]  can be sure of anything all foreign investments gonna dry up they're gonna drive us into the worst
[02:48:20.880 --> 02:48:27.600]  depression this country's ever seen in the world's ever seen if we don't get this fixed and the way
[02:48:27.600 --> 02:48:36.080]  to fix it is for each individual to kick that lenders behind sometimes it's hard for people
[02:48:36.080 --> 02:48:41.120]  because they're embarrassed that they're behind on their mortgage well you shouldn't be embarrassed
[02:48:41.120 --> 02:48:48.000]  if everything about it was a fraud and if you don't go in there and force the banks to do right
[02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:52.400]  your children and your grandchildren are going to suffer with and and and that's on the lower end
[02:48:52.400 --> 02:48:56.640]  where there's a micron of responsibility where they go to poor people tell them to lie on the forms
[02:48:56.640 --> 02:49:01.520]  the bank tells them and the government says go get this this is the american dream knowing they're
[02:49:01.520 --> 02:49:06.560]  going to sell it into derivatives leverage it to the power of you know a million i mean this was
[02:49:06.560 --> 02:49:13.280]  designed to do this and and so that's a fraud for but but this is again i mean i mean i go back
[02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:20.000]  the first house i bought hundred thousand dollars uh nine years ago in south austin it's now about
[02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:26.800]  worth about 150 000 uh and uh the first house i bought hundred thousand dollars and then bank
[02:49:26.800 --> 02:49:31.840]  of america bought my mortgage and then started threatening to sue me and they they literally
[02:49:31.840 --> 02:49:39.040]  took my um escrow it was like five thousand dollars and said you got to pay it again but i said but i've
[02:49:39.040 --> 02:49:42.560]  i went and got all the paperwork got a lawyer the lawyer threatened they said oh it was a mistake
[02:49:42.560 --> 02:49:48.720]  sorry but if i was some you know uneducated poor blue collar you know handyman or something who's
[02:49:48.720 --> 02:49:52.880]  a great guy but doesn't understand all this he just i don't know i'm guessing i'm wrong
[02:49:53.760 --> 02:50:00.080]  they say they're taking it i mean that's that's what happens that's exactly what's been happening
[02:50:00.080 --> 02:50:07.200]  and they've got into such a glut of profit taking that they messed things up for themselves
[02:50:08.400 --> 02:50:13.280]  and now the sky is beginning to fall in on them and it's falling in exactly when we said it would
[02:50:13.280 --> 02:50:21.520]  the politicians who created this mess are going into an election with a 10 approval rating every
[02:50:21.520 --> 02:50:26.560]  member the house the representatives is up for elections looking to get thrown out and primarily
[02:50:26.560 --> 02:50:34.320]  for voting for the bailout are now trying to use the lender as a scapegoat to get the public back
[02:50:34.320 --> 02:50:40.320]  on their side so what they've done is delivered up to lender to the courts now we really have an
[02:50:40.320 --> 02:50:50.160]  opportunity to win these cases in the court we're at a tipping point the stars have been aligning
[02:50:50.160 --> 02:50:57.520]  themselves for a while this pendulum of injustice has swung out as far as it can and it's beginning
[02:50:57.520 --> 02:51:04.240]  to come back and just like just like with roam it it it it happens when the elites go crazy continue
[02:51:04.240 --> 02:51:11.040]  i think yeah it's exactly what's happening we hear these stories about 2012 this great change
[02:51:11.040 --> 02:51:16.400]  coming it's not going to be the nephilim coming down in spaceships it's not going to be some foreign
[02:51:16.400 --> 02:51:22.320]  agent it's going to be us you and i finally the people are going to stand up and say enough of
[02:51:22.320 --> 02:51:30.160]  this crapola and with the mortgage issue there are so many people being ripped off and stolen from
[02:51:30.160 --> 02:51:36.000]  them that it is the best way to get this turned around well randy i want to
[02:51:36.560 --> 02:51:40.560]  announce something here we just skipped the network break so station should be carrying
[02:51:40.560 --> 02:51:44.720]  this we've skipped quite a few i apologize to ted i just this information is so important
[02:51:45.680 --> 02:51:50.000]  you know what i want to go through more of this so we're going to do 20 minutes of overdrive
[02:51:51.200 --> 02:51:56.320]  but that cuts into general general hameed ghoul but i guess people can get it at the
[02:51:56.320 --> 02:52:02.160]  archive or the free podcast or present planet dot tv but you know this is important as well
[02:52:02.160 --> 02:52:07.200]  so so we'll do 20 minutes into the next hour because i i'd promise to get into some other
[02:52:07.200 --> 02:52:10.640]  economic news what i'll do is we'll talk about five more minutes then i'm gonna hit a little bit
[02:52:10.640 --> 02:52:14.960]  of news before the official show ends but most stations still do carry the fourth hour because
[02:52:14.960 --> 02:52:20.880]  a lot of days we we do it live i've just cut the fourth hour because we're getting ready for the tv
[02:52:20.880 --> 02:52:26.400]  show every day at 30 minute news brief and uh then i'm going to do a highly polished once a week one
[02:52:26.400 --> 02:52:30.800]  hour show and so i've just i've got to get everybody ready to where i can't do four hours radio and
[02:52:30.800 --> 02:52:35.920]  then do the preparation and go do a tv show uh we're trying to produce pretty well like a news
[02:52:35.920 --> 02:52:40.560]  program uh i'm just letting folks know uh people are like well why'd you quit doing the fourth hour
[02:52:40.560 --> 02:52:44.960]  well we don't always i literally can't do it when i do four hours i can do 10 hours while i'm live
[02:52:44.960 --> 02:52:50.000]  then after i've done those hours i'm just completely exhausted like a jellyfish and so i gotta keep that
[02:52:50.000 --> 02:52:54.240]  energy uh but uh randy just amazing info can you stay with us 20 minutes to the next hour
[02:52:54.800 --> 02:52:58.640]  yes i can okay and then we're gonna you're gonna have all the documents you can put them on a
[02:52:58.640 --> 02:53:04.720]  disc we can show them on the computer on tv next week and we'll do uh uh we'll do three hours we'll
[02:53:04.720 --> 02:53:10.240]  do one to one to four i said one to five that'd be four hours uh but but continue because there's
[02:53:10.240 --> 02:53:15.440]  so many different types of fraud and they're not going to be able to hide this and and that's what
[02:53:15.440 --> 02:53:22.000]  scares me you know they've invaded pakistan now in afghanistan they're uh they announced uh
[02:53:22.960 --> 02:53:27.920]  a month ago that they made secret deals with the pentagon to steal all the death benefits of
[02:53:27.920 --> 02:53:33.680]  troops that have been paying for uh death insurance from world war two korea vietnam desert storm one
[02:53:33.680 --> 02:53:42.000]  desert storm two uh they i mean it's crazy they've got 400 mobile microwave trucks uh it's crazy

[02:54:16.960 --> 02:54:22.400]  and it's even worse than that uh the banks really don't care about for about actually
[02:54:22.400 --> 02:54:28.400]  foreclosing a cell in your house that's trump change all the money they make on defrauding you

[02:55:33.920 --> 02:55:40.160]  studying i i studied till one o'clock in the morning last night and there's so much knowledge and
[02:55:40.160 --> 02:55:46.240]  the more i learn about evil the more i learn about how they operate and i just and then i look at the
[02:55:46.240 --> 02:55:53.680]  public a bunch of them are totally mesmerized zombies they don't have a clue and they have no
[02:55:53.680 --> 02:55:59.040]  hope if we can't get them to wake up look at how much evil has grown because
[02:56:01.920 --> 02:56:07.360]  we look we forgot how to recognize corruption i mean old timers are like get off my land i don't
[02:56:07.360 --> 02:56:11.760]  trust nobody with my family people are like look at that stupid hillbilly no that hillbilly knows

[02:56:49.920 --> 02:56:54.080]  up my prices are going up people want to take advantage of the software i had earlier on you
[02:56:54.080 --> 02:57:00.880]  better do it by midnight tonight now to quantify it the silver's up gold's up and you always explain
[02:57:00.880 --> 02:57:05.760]  i buy it when it's low i pass the savings on when it goes high all the other brokers literally
[02:57:05.760 --> 02:57:10.080]  don't go up that's their profit it's a free country ted has about three four percent i've seen the
[02:57:10.080 --> 02:57:16.480]  sheets markup on these radio specials to explain this it's very simple uh but that markup isn't
[02:57:16.480 --> 02:57:20.960]  even there and is totally erased by the market going up because he's not raising it to market
[02:57:20.960 --> 02:57:25.920]  prices but it's going to go up when is it going up and what are the offers you've got well you know

[02:57:46.720 --> 02:57:51.920]  away from 24 an ounce that's going to be gone one of the things that i'm doing right now but i
[02:57:51.920 --> 02:57:56.240]  have to ponder this one alex i'm gonna hold it for right now is we're still selling that creature
[02:57:56.240 --> 02:58:01.760]  from jackall island for 2645 delivered that still comes with the silver dollar that's just an
[02:58:01.760 --> 02:58:05.440]  absolute steal and it gives you one of the best books that have ever been written about the fed
[02:58:05.440 --> 02:58:11.280]  out there basically it's a free silver dollar it's a 1995 book with a 23 or four dollar silver
[02:58:11.280 --> 02:58:18.240]  dollar uh that's insane uh you're pondering going up on that i well i don't know i just call us at

[02:59:10.320 --> 02:59:15.520]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[02:59:15.520 --> 02:59:21.200]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is
[02:59:21.200 --> 02:59:25.360]  always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from

[03:00:14.160 --> 03:00:18.080]  Jonathan irish and that whole thing in new hampshire with the baby snatching over the

[03:00:36.000 --> 03:00:41.920]  he've interviewed him before been following him for about four or five years uh and uh he's got
[03:00:41.920 --> 03:00:46.000]  basically the best clearest research and he tells people this is a completely criminal
[03:00:46.000 --> 03:00:50.400]  court system and the systems he's come up with and studying other successful cases
[03:00:51.200 --> 03:00:56.720]  is the best there is and that it didn't say a lot but it's had a lot of successes and some
[03:00:56.720 --> 03:01:00.880]  failures but it's it's like medicine you practice and you learn what he is good at is analyzing
[03:01:00.880 --> 03:01:05.040]  their criminality their fraud at every level and basically a bunch of crooks have taken

[03:01:28.240 --> 03:01:32.640]  video out we got a break coming up in our minute in one long segment with you randy kind of recap
[03:01:32.640 --> 03:01:36.960]  what you were getting into and and again the systemic fraud and the tipping point you talked
[03:01:36.960 --> 03:01:44.240]  about and where all this is going yes uh we have been predicting since march when the government
[03:01:44.240 --> 03:01:53.760]  allotted 200 million to the fbi to investigate in financial fraud that by june or july they would
[03:01:53.760 --> 03:02:01.040]  start indicted guiding people which they did some 500 october november there or september
[03:02:01.040 --> 03:02:07.360]  october they would start prosecuting well we i expected prosecutions i didn't expect the onslaught
[03:02:07.360 --> 03:02:14.400]  that we're getting these incredible rulings against the lender a ruling out of south out of
[03:02:14.400 --> 03:02:21.840]  the southern court of uh san diego california said that if mers is involved in your note
[03:02:22.640 --> 03:02:28.560]  your note is virtually unenforceable and that's that fake computer uh deed filing
[03:02:28.560 --> 03:02:36.400]  yes they made up this mortgage electronic registration service they told the court of
[03:02:36.400 --> 03:02:41.920]  kansas that this requirement to file the the sale of a security instrument with the clerk
[03:02:41.920 --> 03:02:46.640]  with the county recorder's office is archaic costly and cumbersome and we come up with
[03:02:46.640 --> 03:02:53.840]  this with the bank company so they can file it with us well the court told them you're right it is
[03:02:53.840 --> 03:02:59.120]  this archaic costly and cumbersome but you have to take that up with the legislate because it's
[03:02:59.120 --> 03:03:04.000]  worked and you got to have people with their hands on it that's what works the best system in the
[03:03:04.000 --> 03:03:12.240]  world not your globalism scams run by kinley and bernie madeoff exactly they used mers and now the
[03:03:12.240 --> 03:03:18.640]  sky is falling in on them because of it it was a scam so that mers could stand in the front and
[03:03:18.640 --> 03:03:23.440]  pretend like they were the holder of the note and behind mers these companies could sell the notes
[03:03:23.440 --> 03:03:29.840]  back and forth it caused the originating the origination of the note to disappear nobody
[03:03:29.840 --> 03:03:37.600]  knows who owns it anymore and as far as property that will destabilize the whole title is not blurred
[03:03:37.600 --> 03:03:44.240]  the title is annihilated right gone you just there's just no way of digging through all this
[03:03:44.240 --> 03:03:51.360]  morass of trash and worse than that mers would would scan the note into their records and then
[03:03:51.360 --> 03:03:56.400]  shred the original randy look this is all part of it this is order out of chaos they're going to
[03:03:56.400 --> 03:04:01.680]  destroy the whole private property system the feds are going to take everything over i'm i'm
[03:04:01.680 --> 03:04:10.560]  afraid my biggest fear is that behind the banksters the real money people have very deliberately
[03:04:10.560 --> 03:04:16.480]  orchestrated this whole thing as you go through how this was set up yeah this is like putting a
[03:04:16.480 --> 03:04:22.320]  swiss watch together with a blindfold on and you know making it out of sand that you know this
[03:04:22.320 --> 03:04:29.760]  didn't happen by accident yeah and i'm afraid that that the builder birds and and those with that
[03:04:29.760 --> 03:04:34.080]  kind of power and money have orchestrated the whole thing they don't mind throwing the lender to the
[03:04:34.080 --> 03:04:40.160]  wolves what did daniel estalon tell me in 2006 it's an in-game blue Brentford global enslavement
[03:04:40.160 --> 03:04:44.640]  it's also in the obama deception what did he say the builder berg source and he has a member
[03:04:44.640 --> 03:04:49.040]  that's actually a source said we're going to implode the mortgages coming up in the next two years
[03:04:49.600 --> 03:04:54.080]  nobody was talking about that then yeah absolutely they have done this whole thing
[03:04:54.080 --> 03:04:58.800]  ordered out of ko stay there randy kelton let's continue to look at mers on the other side we'll

[03:08:38.560 --> 03:08:43.920]  myself and watson comes in does the last two hours of the friday show you don't want to miss
[03:08:43.920 --> 03:08:48.400]  that coming up there's a key video that erin has posted at the alex jones channel we need you to get
[03:08:48.400 --> 03:08:51.680]  out to everybody to promote the money bomb plus it's a riveting piece i think it's the best piece
[03:08:51.680 --> 03:08:57.040]  he's done 12 minutes long it's called we're under attack and it's up at info wars dot com and prison
[03:08:57.040 --> 03:09:01.120]  planet dot com right now and the alex jones channel and of course we premiered it here last hour
[03:09:01.760 --> 03:09:07.520]  okay randy for the rest of this 18 minutes 12 minute segment you've got the floor uh continue
[03:09:07.520 --> 03:09:13.440]  going through the fraud and where you see all of this going because as bob chatman covered last
[03:09:13.440 --> 03:09:17.520]  friday he was surprised obama did it but they understand if they do this it totally undermines
[03:09:17.520 --> 03:09:24.560]  all confidence and it even hurts their scam worse but higher ups are above that are pushing for it
[03:09:24.560 --> 03:09:30.160]  the congress passed a law that would allow the president the way bob described it and i've read
[03:09:30.160 --> 03:09:36.000]  over it and you can correct me because you understand the the intricacies of all of this
[03:09:36.000 --> 03:09:41.680]  that would basically uh say okay there's a new law you don't really need proof of deeds as long as
[03:09:41.680 --> 03:09:45.280]  they have this derivative they can take your house but then the predators are going to come in and
[03:09:45.280 --> 03:09:51.120]  keep taking houses they don't own or fighting with each other uh and bob thinks that after the election
[03:09:51.120 --> 03:10:01.680]  obama will then sign it in the lame duck session i'm afraid that he's right but if they do do that
[03:10:01.680 --> 03:10:10.800]  they will create a condition that will condemn this country to a depression that's far worse than
[03:10:10.800 --> 03:10:19.920]  anything we've imagined because we will receive no investment from anyone anywhere if they allow
[03:10:19.920 --> 03:10:24.480]  this to happen no one would dare invest in property in the united states because then
[03:10:24.480 --> 03:10:30.400]  everyone who's going to come and take it so it's the equivalent of dropping 10 000 uh financial
[03:10:30.400 --> 03:10:37.600]  nuclear warheads on us if that's about the equivalent that would be the deathmel of of this
[03:10:37.600 --> 03:10:44.480]  country as we know it mission accomplished i think they've had it set up from the start
[03:10:45.200 --> 03:10:51.600]  but while this is going on there are things we can fix and things we can't and i primarily
[03:10:52.480 --> 03:10:58.000]  work toward remedy yeah give us a preview because people will now be calling us by the
[03:10:58.000 --> 03:11:01.920]  thousands and next week i mean you're not even you didn't really want to come on because you're
[03:11:01.920 --> 03:11:05.840]  not you're already so busy you're running around the country you're almost scared of the response
[03:11:05.840 --> 03:11:12.480]  you're gonna people need to help i understand that randy but but just in in basics let's take the
[03:11:12.480 --> 03:11:18.560]  top three of the hundreds of different variants of scams and give us a few case point examples of
[03:11:18.560 --> 03:11:23.360]  court cases that have been winning things you've been doing that are successful uh you i mean i
[03:11:23.360 --> 03:11:28.560]  was talking to you're saying uh you know maybe out of 30 cases you're you're you're having success
[03:11:28.560 --> 03:11:34.720]  in two or three you're not uh so i mean just give people some basic ideas okay we're having
[03:11:34.720 --> 03:11:41.680]  general success and almost all of them was uh we've got about 300 cases filed in court and we
[03:11:41.680 --> 03:11:48.160]  only have about four or five people who are out of their property and primarily what we're doing
[03:11:48.160 --> 03:11:55.040]  initially is stop the trying to stop the banksters in their tracks and for all of the stuff that's
[03:11:55.040 --> 03:12:03.440]  out there there's no magic in stopping the bankers so good suit bad suit any suit just through them
[03:12:03.440 --> 03:12:07.680]  it puts them into court and blocks them while it's going on and they've committed so much fraud
[03:12:07.680 --> 03:12:13.440]  they're going to be in trouble exactly and we were suggesting people through in the fed and
[03:12:13.440 --> 03:12:21.440]  sue pros say we tell people if you sue pros say in the courts you can be sure that the courts are
[03:12:21.440 --> 03:12:29.360]  absolutely totally corrupt they are so corrupt that the other guys can't trust them either
[03:12:30.480 --> 03:12:35.840]  in the end the law doesn't really matter a whole lot in the end everything is politics
[03:12:36.880 --> 03:12:42.880]  and now the politics is changing and if you go in pros say you have certain advantages
[03:12:42.880 --> 03:12:49.440]  the court's going to rule against you out of hand we already know that so in going pro say
[03:12:50.240 --> 03:12:55.280]  we know that if we get an attorney the attorney's going to take ten thousand dollars and do nothing
[03:12:55.280 --> 03:13:02.160]  so he's not going to help you so if you go in pros say you can do things the attorney can't we
[03:13:02.160 --> 03:13:07.520]  we say that the the courts hate pros say litigants but they don't hate pros say litigants because
[03:13:07.520 --> 03:13:13.200]  they filed stupid pleading they hate pros say litigants because every once in a while they run
[03:13:13.200 --> 03:13:19.440]  across the pros say from hell the pros say who knows how to kick their behinds every way from
[03:13:19.440 --> 03:13:26.560]  sunday and who knows there's nothing the court can do about that's the power of pros say yeah
[03:13:27.440 --> 03:13:34.880]  we go in pros say and eat initially softening up the the judge by filing unicor conda complaints
[03:13:34.880 --> 03:13:40.800]  on him every time he breathes then go down to the grand jury with criminal charges with him
[03:13:40.800 --> 03:13:46.320]  against him and try to get him arrested which we won't get him arrested but if we're waving
[03:13:46.320 --> 03:13:51.040]  criminal charges in front of the grand jury there's a chance he could and that would terrify him more
[03:13:51.040 --> 03:13:58.960]  than us getting in front of the grand jury we can use tools attorneys would not dare use we can
[03:13:58.960 --> 03:14:05.680]  create influence and pressures that attorneys would never use and then at the end we bring in council
[03:14:05.680 --> 03:14:10.640]  so council can ride in on his white horse and pull these dirty rotten pros say off the attorneys
[03:14:10.640 --> 03:14:17.840]  and the judges and get a deal the individual can live with but initially it's about stopping the
[03:14:17.840 --> 03:14:22.800]  courts we started this in november of last year we've had about four people lose their house
[03:14:22.800 --> 03:14:28.720]  and that's because they were already so far advanced in the procedure was too late to stop them
[03:14:29.360 --> 03:14:35.680]  they could still go back and sue the lender for the fraud in the case and and and and let's explain
[03:14:35.680 --> 03:14:39.840]  you know you talk about uh you're the greatest plagiarist ever well that's not that's a joke
[03:14:39.840 --> 03:14:44.960]  there's no plagiarism in law that's called precedent talk about the cases that have got the system so
[03:14:44.960 --> 03:14:50.560]  scared that the five biggest lenders in the country led by the biggest overall mortgage holder uh bank
[03:14:50.560 --> 03:14:59.440]  of america have ceased all repossessions and the bbc says you know in their headline uh obama will
[03:14:59.440 --> 03:15:05.360]  not ban home repossession fraud so they i mean worldwide it's fraud people can look at it it's
[03:15:05.360 --> 03:15:12.560]  fraud specifically tell us about some of the victorious cases we have two major cases out of
[03:15:12.560 --> 03:15:22.640]  the bankruptcy court in san diego where the guys went into court chapter seven they put their house
[03:15:22.640 --> 03:15:28.480]  in the bankruptcy chapter seven is unsecured and the bank said wait a minute i've got a
[03:15:28.480 --> 03:15:36.800]  lien against this property and the court said okay prove it well uh we're the servicer so what
[03:15:36.800 --> 03:15:43.600]  the bank said you can't prove owner you can't prove that you have a lien against the property the
[03:15:43.600 --> 03:15:48.720]  property is unsecured they gave it back to them to the to the borrower and that goes back to this
[03:15:48.720 --> 03:15:55.120]  mirrors what percentage of the uh current mortgages that are out there are under mers this fraud
[03:15:55.120 --> 03:16:04.320]  and that goes back to this mers what percentage of the uh current mortgages that are out there are
[03:16:04.320 --> 03:16:12.480]  out there are under mers this fraud well the number is 62 million almost everything is involved in
[03:16:12.480 --> 03:16:20.240]  with mers in one way or another as those who are aren't involved in mers are involved in the same
[03:16:20.800 --> 03:16:28.080]  kinds of manipulation that mers use that the people who use mers got into so everybody's
[03:16:28.080 --> 03:16:34.800]  essentially in the same boat that's what more of the bank of america's problems if they have
[03:16:34.800 --> 03:16:41.840]  china coming after them because not only did they rip off the borrower they ripped off the
[03:16:41.840 --> 03:16:46.160]  investors big time and that actually came out a year and a half ago mainly with europe that they
[03:16:46.160 --> 03:16:52.480]  quote sold them these bad derivatives with packaged uh mortgages and that they sold them from the
[03:16:52.480 --> 03:16:59.920]  credit default swaps the baskets of crud and kept the cream uh microcosm is timber wolf uh with
[03:16:59.920 --> 03:17:04.720]  goldman sacks you know saying this is absolute toxic waste let's sell it to our customers for
[03:17:04.720 --> 03:17:12.720]  triple a rating prices and so this goes worldwide and then they sold the same ones to them 10 15
[03:17:12.720 --> 03:17:20.240]  20 times it wasn't bad enough that they sold them garbage the first time they sold them the same
[03:17:20.240 --> 03:17:24.480]  garbage over and over but if you're going to sell garbage the first time why not a thousand times you
[03:17:24.480 --> 03:17:29.920]  know it doesn't get any worse you're going to rob one bank why not rob 50 you know that's it's kind
[03:17:29.920 --> 03:17:38.720]  of that way so now the banks have foreign investors coming at them a union and retirement fund sued
[03:17:38.720 --> 03:17:46.080]  one of the remix for 11 billion accusing the remake of feeding the investment with predatory
[03:17:46.080 --> 03:17:53.600]  loans intended to default so they sued for 11 billion the banks have people coming at them from
[03:17:53.600 --> 03:18:02.480]  every direction and you and i as individual homeowners we're like small little flies the
[03:18:02.480 --> 03:18:08.240]  only one who are who wants are really coming at us our attorney yeah we were the average we were
[03:18:08.240 --> 03:18:14.560]  the vector point where the fraud was originally originated dealing with real property but since
[03:18:14.560 --> 03:18:21.600]  then it's been leveraged to over 1.5 quadrillion exactly it's just grown away from us we're minor
[03:18:21.600 --> 03:18:26.640]  the ones coming after us are these scumbag attorneys so what we're doing is going back
[03:18:26.640 --> 03:18:33.760]  after the attorney if the attorney filed a document in the case and he claims that this his client
[03:18:33.760 --> 03:18:39.280]  is the holder of the note he has a duty to make sure that's true he can't accept what is it what
[03:18:39.280 --> 03:18:44.720]  his client says he says he has to determine that for himself that's right he's practicing law but
[03:18:44.720 --> 03:18:48.960]  he didn't he hadn't fallen real estate law he didn't go down to the title company he just did it
[03:18:50.080 --> 03:18:57.520]  right so now we go for his throat we take bar grievances we take criminal complaints for filing
[03:18:57.520 --> 03:19:02.480]  fraudulent documents with the court and take them down to the prosecutor's attorney who refused to
[03:19:02.480 --> 03:19:08.000]  prosecute at least we hope he does and then we take criminal charges against the prosecutor
[03:19:08.000 --> 03:19:13.760]  for not prosecuting the lender to the head district judge and get him to refuse to act
[03:19:13.760 --> 03:19:18.800]  to take complaints against the prosecutor then it kicks it into federal no then we take the federal
[03:19:18.800 --> 03:19:22.880]  to take take the district judge down to the grand jury and ask the grand jury to arrest district
[03:19:22.880 --> 03:19:27.680]  judge well district judge is not going to be happy he's going to go back to that prosecutor
[03:19:27.680 --> 03:19:32.080]  to say what's going on here i covered you're behind they're coming after me you better fix it
[03:19:32.080 --> 03:19:37.040]  all right randy we're out of time you'll be here next wednesday uh in the third hour and we'll
