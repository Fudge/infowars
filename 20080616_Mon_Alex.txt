[00:00.000 --> 00:09.000]  media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN
[00:09.000 --> 00:20.000]  Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:20.000 --> 00:29.000]  The global predatory parasite state is carrying out all of its plans to set up its
[00:29.000 --> 00:34.000]  mechanical one-world government. We're here desperately trying to get people to get past
[00:34.000 --> 00:39.000]  all their left-right distractions and diversions or what country they're from or what color
[00:39.000 --> 00:44.000]  they are. And to realize that we have a global scientific dictatorship that has studied how
[00:44.000 --> 00:48.000]  humans operate, and they are punching our buttons, they are manipulating us, they are
[00:48.000 --> 00:56.000]  controlling us. It is the 16th day of June 2008. We're going to be live here for the
[00:56.000 --> 01:03.000]  next four hours. I will be in studio for the next hour, then Jason Burmes for the following
[01:03.000 --> 01:08.000]  three. I made a promise to my family that my children are growing up and I hardly ever
[01:08.000 --> 01:12.000]  get to spend more than a few hours a day with them and I take a few days off because I was
[01:12.000 --> 01:18.000]  out of town for Bilderberg. That's why I may not be at 9-11, 2008. I want to be there,
[01:18.000 --> 01:22.000]  but I'm trying to finish two films right now. Truth Rising is done, but it's being
[01:22.000 --> 01:29.000]  mastered, mass produced later this week. I'm trying to finish Fabled Enemies with Jason
[01:29.000 --> 01:38.000]  Burmes before 2008 is over while 9-11 is at its peak. I'm doing so many other issues.
[01:38.000 --> 01:42.000]  People want me to go to the DNC and cover that police state in Denver. They want me to go
[01:42.000 --> 01:47.000]  to these other events, but then I'm just completely out of town on top of my heavy workload and
[01:47.000 --> 01:51.000]  then I don't even see my family, but I'll take the next few days off and then I'll be back
[01:51.000 --> 01:55.000]  later in the week and Burmes again will be sitting in. We appreciate him doing that.
[01:55.000 --> 01:59.000]  A lot of big guests lined up for you this week, but I did go ahead and come in this
[01:59.000 --> 02:04.000]  morning because I literally can't control myself. I have such a passion to want to warn
[02:04.000 --> 02:10.000]  you, such a passion to want to cover what's happening in the world that I was supposed
[02:10.000 --> 02:18.000]  to spend time with family today and I just couldn't control myself. Here I am. Here I
[02:18.000 --> 02:22.000]  am. The next hour I'm going to try to cover this big stack of news, a bunch of news from
[02:22.000 --> 02:26.000]  today and some news yesterday I never got to on the Sunday show. Report Blackwater
[02:26.000 --> 02:31.000]  Worldwide Purchasing Brazilian Made Fighter Planes. Nuclear Ring Reportedly Had Advanced
[02:31.000 --> 02:38.000]  Design. Get Osama Bin Laden Before I Leave Office. Bush Orders. British Special Forces.
[02:38.000 --> 02:44.000]  Gennrich says Supreme Court decision will cost us a city. More terrorism from him. I'm going
[02:44.000 --> 02:50.000]  to cover that first detail. Top Court eases rules for foreigners to stay in the U.S. illegally.
[02:50.000 --> 02:56.000]  The Marxist Roots of Global Warming Scare. U.S. Blogger Charged with Insulting a Singapore
[02:56.000 --> 03:04.000]  Judge. Soddy King, we will pump more oil. Tentative Accord on Spy Bill, Immunity Sources,
[03:04.000 --> 03:11.000]  the End of the Fourth Amendment Reuters. McCain Attacks Guantanamo Rulings is the
[03:11.000 --> 03:17.000]  worst in history. Irish Voters Reject EU Treaty. I know we've been covering this since Friday,
[03:17.000 --> 03:23.000]  but we'll talk about the ramifications of what this means, a big, big victory. Fed
[03:23.000 --> 03:28.000]  farms out in prison slaves to make corporations rich. And I know about this, you know about
[03:28.000 --> 03:33.000]  this, we all know about it, but do you know the full details, the full magnitude? They're
[03:33.000 --> 03:39.000]  not just making furniture and license plates or cutting the highways, trimming the grass.
[03:39.000 --> 03:45.000]  They are engaged in slave labor under orders. They are put in the hold. They are tortured
[03:45.000 --> 03:52.000]  basically. They are not even fed subsistence food unless they work as slaves. And they
[03:52.000 --> 03:59.000]  are taking computer jobs. They are taking telecommunications jobs. They are taking secretary jobs. And
[03:59.000 --> 04:05.000]  in fact, now they're competing with India and the illegal aliens. People talk about the illegal
[04:05.000 --> 04:10.000]  aliens driving down wages or outsourcing doing it. What about 4 million people in prison,
[04:10.000 --> 04:14.000]  more than 8 million in the system and out of prison, millions of them competing against
[04:14.000 --> 04:19.000]  their jobs for profit? Not for the prisons. We pay the taxes for the prisons and then
[04:19.000 --> 04:25.000]  private groups get the slave labor. So now when you get sent to the government slave camp,
[04:25.000 --> 04:29.000]  you have to work. So I thought we'd cover some of that as well. More on their plan to shut
[04:29.000 --> 04:34.000]  down the web, which unbelievably I heard national radio this weekend as they were promoting
[04:34.000 --> 04:40.000]  the idea on a computer show of how wonderful it is. So we will break it all down after
[04:40.000 --> 04:47.000]  this quick break. The websites are infowars.com, infowars.net, prisonplanet.tv, jonesreport.com,
[04:47.000 --> 05:15.000]  truthnews.us. We'll be right back after this quick break. Stay with us.

[05:57.000 --> 06:02.000]  real. Flower is already being rationed. Prices on food are getting so high warehouses are
[06:02.000 --> 06:08.000]  installing security systems and guards. You can expect soon to see criminal activity in food.
[06:08.000 --> 06:13.000]  We're all in a foot race as to whether the food will become so expensive we can't afford
[06:13.000 --> 06:18.000]  food or there will be no food at any price. We can't grow enough of our own food even
[06:18.000 --> 06:23.000]  with genetically altered trash. It will give you the opportunity to eat perfectly engineered
[06:23.000 --> 06:29.000]  food. They think God didn't get it right, so Monsanto had to step in. If you think it's
[06:29.000 --> 06:36.000]  a little bit crazy to put in a supply of food, it's okay. We won't tell. Call 800-409-5633
[06:36.000 --> 06:46.000]  on the web, eFoodsDirect.com. That's 800-409-5633. It may be a little bit crazy. That's okay.
[06:46.000 --> 07:15.000]  Because there is no such thing as a little bit dead.
[07:17.000 --> 07:41.000]  There is no such thing as a little bit of dead.

[08:03.000 --> 08:06.000]  You want answers? Well so does he.
[08:06.000 --> 08:15.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[08:18.000 --> 08:25.000]  I'm going to make several key announcements at the bottom of the shower in 22 minutes,
[08:25.000 --> 08:29.000]  so call your neighbors, your friends, your family, folks that you know are regular listeners
[08:29.000 --> 08:33.000]  on AM and FM dials, shortwave internet satellite, tell them to tune in,
[08:33.000 --> 08:38.000]  or when the show rebroadcast on the web starting at three o'clock Central Standard
[08:38.000 --> 08:44.000]  at time four o'clock Eastern, tell people to tune in because it is important information
[08:44.000 --> 08:48.000]  and points that we need to be made, several points.
[08:48.000 --> 08:55.000]  I'm also going to try to have a cogent, calm, little five minute message for the neocons.
[08:55.000 --> 09:02.000]  You know that Mark Dice last week, Michael Reagan, one of the biggest talk show hosts in the country,
[09:02.000 --> 09:06.000]  called for his murder, contracted for his murder and other 9-11 truthers,
[09:06.000 --> 09:14.000]  said that he would pay to have us killed, pay to have the bullets paid for, to have us killed.
[09:14.000 --> 09:18.000]  Mark Dice is going to be popping in for about 10, 15 minutes in the next hour
[09:18.000 --> 09:21.000]  when Burmese is sitting in for me, Jason Burmese,
[09:21.000 --> 09:25.000]  and then today he's scheduled to be going on at Michael Reagan's show,
[09:25.000 --> 09:30.000]  where Michael Reagan personally called him a few days ago and said that he's going to apologize on air.
[09:30.000 --> 09:32.000]  He's going to go basically like this.
[09:32.000 --> 09:35.000]  Well, you know, I had just been meeting with the troops a few days before.
[09:35.000 --> 09:37.000]  Watch, this is what will be said.
[09:37.000 --> 09:42.000]  And they told me how much they love the war and how much they're committed to it
[09:42.000 --> 09:46.000]  and how they're all for it and how they love all the lies we've told them.
[09:46.000 --> 09:52.000]  And they were just really need our support and I was just so mad at him
[09:52.000 --> 09:55.000]  for what he's doing to the troops and the treason he's committing
[09:55.000 --> 09:59.000]  that I went a little too far and said that he should be killed
[09:59.000 --> 10:01.000]  and I didn't mean that and nobody should hurt him,
[10:01.000 --> 10:05.000]  but it is treason and I think that they should be tried for treason.
[10:05.000 --> 10:08.000]  Now, watch, that's what they're going to say.
[10:08.000 --> 10:09.000]  How do I know?
[10:09.000 --> 10:13.000]  Because I talked to several people that talked to Mike Reagan,
[10:13.000 --> 10:17.000]  somebody in Talk Radio who talked to him this weekend who I won't name,
[10:17.000 --> 10:19.000]  Mark Dice who talked to him,
[10:19.000 --> 10:24.000]  and we posted a story from Op-Ed News from someone who had his number and talked to him.
[10:24.000 --> 10:30.000]  He knows a good writer and trustworthy, plus it matches the two people that I talked to that I know talked to Reagan.
[10:30.000 --> 10:32.000]  And that's basically what he's saying.
[10:32.000 --> 10:38.000]  So not a hard prediction when we already know what his story is.
[10:38.000 --> 10:41.000]  And people can say, well, you know, why is this such a big news story?
[10:41.000 --> 10:46.000]  Why have you posted probably 15 articles on InfoWars and Prison Planet from your sites and other sites?
[10:46.000 --> 10:47.000]  Why are you?
[10:47.000 --> 10:51.000]  Because if they can set the precedent to sit up there and say we need to be murdered,
[10:51.000 --> 10:56.000]  if they can go along with this White House talking point that we know is a White House talking point,
[10:56.000 --> 10:59.000]  saying 9-11 truthers with no evidence,
[10:59.000 --> 11:04.000]  bombed the Army, Navy, Marine Corps Recruiting Center in Times Square,
[11:04.000 --> 11:11.000]  in the months previous to that, they in unison, CNN, MSNBC, Fox,
[11:11.000 --> 11:15.000]  all said that the military quote needs to be used against us,
[11:15.000 --> 11:17.000]  that we are going to carry out terrorism,
[11:17.000 --> 11:21.000]  that we are treasonous, that we need to be arrested, that we need to be tasered,
[11:21.000 --> 11:25.000]  that we need to be beaten, that we need to be taken to secret camps.
[11:25.000 --> 11:27.000]  All of this has been said.
[11:27.000 --> 11:28.000]  We've played the clips.
[11:28.000 --> 11:35.000]  Mellow Riley, Sean Hannity, Joe Scarborough,
[11:35.000 --> 11:39.000]  the list of individuals that have said this goes on and on and on.
[11:39.000 --> 11:41.000]  It is a talking point.
[11:41.000 --> 11:46.000]  Geraldo Rivera, that is a White House talking point.
[11:46.000 --> 11:48.000]  Mike Reagan, of course, was photographed.
[11:48.000 --> 11:51.000]  He went to the White House, met with Bush, and was quote given talking points.
[11:51.000 --> 11:53.000]  They hide all of this in plain view.
[11:53.000 --> 11:56.000]  That should show everybody that they are scared of us,
[11:56.000 --> 12:00.000]  that they know we're hitting very close to the nerve,
[12:00.000 --> 12:03.000]  that the bullet is hitting the bone in the Info War,
[12:03.000 --> 12:07.000]  and that it is shattering their fraud and their lies and their pretext
[12:07.000 --> 12:11.000]  to control and enslave our society.
[12:11.000 --> 12:17.000]  Let's go ahead and play this clip of Newt Gennrich this weekend.
[12:17.000 --> 12:23.000]  He was on one of the news shows, Face the Nation,
[12:23.000 --> 12:27.000]  and here he is engaging in psychological warfare and terrorism,
[12:27.000 --> 12:29.000]  saying we're going to lose a city.
[12:29.000 --> 12:31.000]  Now, he gives this speech every week.
[12:31.000 --> 12:36.000]  In the full speech, he says to a nuke in the Face the Nation,
[12:36.000 --> 12:38.000]  he did not say we would lose a city to a nuke.
[12:38.000 --> 12:42.000]  He just said we will lose a city, but that goes without saying lose a city.
[12:42.000 --> 12:46.000]  To lose a city would have to be an atomic weapon of some type.
[12:46.000 --> 12:48.000]  So let's go ahead and play this clip.
[12:48.000 --> 12:51.000]  The problem with Obama is he's wrong.
[12:51.000 --> 12:54.000]  It's not that he's inexperienced, it's that his policies are wrong.
[12:54.000 --> 12:56.000]  He applauded this court decision.
[12:56.000 --> 13:00.000]  This court decision is a disaster which could cost us a city.
[13:00.000 --> 13:05.000]  And the debate ought to be over whether or not you're prepared to risk losing an American city
[13:05.000 --> 13:09.000]  on behalf of five lawyers. It was a five to four decision.
[13:09.000 --> 13:13.000]  And five lawyers have decided that the Supreme Court counts more than the Congress
[13:13.000 --> 13:16.000]  and the President combined in national security.
[13:16.000 --> 13:18.000]  That has never been true in American history.
[13:18.000 --> 13:22.000]  That ought to be a principled argument between McCain and Obama
[13:22.000 --> 13:27.000]  about whether or not you're prepared to allow any random nutcake district judge
[13:27.000 --> 13:31.000]  who has no knowledge of national security to set the rules for terrorists.
[13:31.000 --> 13:33.000]  Briefly.
[13:33.000 --> 13:37.000]  Okay, let's walk through the fallacies in that.
[13:37.000 --> 13:43.000]  Gingrich sat on the Council on Foreign Relations Committee, the Hart-Rubbin Commission,
[13:43.000 --> 13:47.000]  that called for the Department of Homeland Security several years before it was set up.
[13:47.000 --> 13:50.000]  The famous commission met two days after 9-11.
[13:50.000 --> 13:54.000]  We have clips of that in Road to Terony and several other films where
[13:54.000 --> 13:58.000]  Gary Hart says we need to use this disaster for a new world order
[13:58.000 --> 14:04.000]  to set up what George Bush called for a new world order.
[14:04.000 --> 14:07.000]  And Gingrich knows exactly what he's doing.
[14:07.000 --> 14:10.000]  Now, let's talk about the ruling here.
[14:10.000 --> 14:16.000]  The Supreme Court said that they at least have to have some chance
[14:16.000 --> 14:25.000]  within a few months of being detained to be able to have access to the courts.
[14:25.000 --> 14:32.000]  Now, under the Defense Authorization Act, under the Enemy Commissions Act,
[14:32.000 --> 14:37.000]  the Military Commissions Act, it states that U.S. citizens can be grabbed
[14:37.000 --> 14:42.000]  instantly, extra judiciously, separate from any court, declared by the President,
[14:42.000 --> 14:45.000]  the Secretary of Defense, or any of his designates, an enemy combatant,
[14:45.000 --> 14:55.000]  and it's unclear in the orders, and disappeared into a black hole.
[14:55.000 --> 15:02.000]  Now, if they have proof that these individuals are supposedly tied into terror networks,
[15:02.000 --> 15:05.000]  even if you believe they exist outside of the intelligence agencies
[15:05.000 --> 15:08.000]  that are carrying out the attacks and funding these groups,
[15:08.000 --> 15:10.000]  then if they've got the proof, they need to show it.
[15:10.000 --> 15:15.000]  And in federal court, they can even be in, quote, secret proceedings,
[15:15.000 --> 15:18.000]  and they've had those many times in the past.
[15:18.000 --> 15:22.000]  You see, Gingrich and others represent one thing while they do another.
[15:22.000 --> 15:24.000]  It's like with Bush saying a few years ago,
[15:24.000 --> 15:28.000]  we do not spy without warrants, we do not spy on U.S. citizens,
[15:28.000 --> 15:31.000]  and then they got caught spying on millions of us,
[15:31.000 --> 15:35.000]  something that they've already been doing for decades with the National Security Agency
[15:35.000 --> 15:37.000]  and the echelon system.
[15:37.000 --> 15:42.000]  Back in the mid-90s and up until 2000, the media would deny echelon existed.
[15:42.000 --> 15:46.000]  Twenty years ago, they denied the National Security Agency existed.
[15:46.000 --> 15:51.000]  I remember being on talk radio in 96, 97, 98, talking about echelon
[15:51.000 --> 15:53.000]  and how they used key words and listened to your phones,
[15:53.000 --> 15:57.000]  and neocons would write articles and I would go into the people's shows
[15:57.000 --> 15:59.000]  and they would attack me and they'd say, I was a liar.
[15:59.000 --> 16:01.000]  The government doesn't do that, it doesn't exist.
[16:01.000 --> 16:05.000]  Well, now we all know it exists and we all know they were doing it.
[16:05.000 --> 16:08.000]  And I was only going off the declassified documents and what was admitted.
[16:08.000 --> 16:12.000]  It's kind of like Israel having 400-plus nukes and Fox News says,
[16:12.000 --> 16:14.000]  well, it's true but you're not allowed to say it.
[16:14.000 --> 16:17.000]  Well, a few years ago, they called that a conspiracy theory.
[16:17.000 --> 16:20.000]  They called the North American Union a conspiracy theory.
[16:20.000 --> 16:23.000]  They basically talked to you like children.
[16:23.000 --> 16:26.000]  So, so, so, Gennrich is up here saying,
[16:26.000 --> 16:28.000]  we've got to do this to keep us all safe from these terrorists,
[16:28.000 --> 16:33.000]  but then we have the section chief of the CIA over Central Asia
[16:33.000 --> 16:36.000]  writing a book two years ago.
[16:36.000 --> 16:38.000]  Was it Job Breaker?
[16:38.000 --> 16:42.000]  We had him on and there were a bunch of news articles about it
[16:42.000 --> 16:48.000]  saying that they were ordered to let 6,000 Taliban and al-Qaeda go.
[16:48.000 --> 16:50.000]  The US loaded them on C-130s.
[16:50.000 --> 16:55.000]  The true al-Qaeda set up in 1979 to attack the Soviets
[16:55.000 --> 16:56.000]  when the Soviets responded.
[16:56.000 --> 16:58.000]  That's the admitted history now declassified.
[16:58.000 --> 17:01.000]  It's not the other way around as we've all been taught
[17:01.000 --> 17:07.000]  these Tom Hanks movies tell us, like Charlie Wilson's War,
[17:07.000 --> 17:12.000]  total theater, total fiction,
[17:12.000 --> 17:16.000]  part of these false narratives that were taught.
[17:16.000 --> 17:19.000]  And they said that they would roast a cow.
[17:19.000 --> 17:23.000]  They don't have a lot of cows in Afghanistan.
[17:23.000 --> 17:27.000]  It is a complete delicacy and they would have the goat herders
[17:27.000 --> 17:30.000]  who anthropologists have reported for decades
[17:30.000 --> 17:33.000]  that they know where the US is on a map
[17:33.000 --> 17:36.000]  are literally the equivalent of cavemen.
[17:36.000 --> 17:39.000]  They would go set up because they had to have somebody to pack
[17:39.000 --> 17:42.000]  on Hanama Bay with to give the illusion of terrorists
[17:42.000 --> 17:44.000]  and to test their torture techniques.
[17:44.000 --> 17:46.000]  They admit it's, quote, a laboratory.
[17:46.000 --> 17:48.000]  There's a CIA torture camp with the more advanced stuff
[17:48.000 --> 17:52.000]  in the outside camp where they engage in torture.
[17:52.000 --> 17:56.000]  And there's so many facets to that one minute clip
[17:56.000 --> 17:59.000]  where I could just spend days breaking down all the lies
[17:59.000 --> 18:02.000]  and frauds of Newt Genridge, but bottom line is this.
[18:02.000 --> 18:05.000]  They would then bring the goat herders down
[18:05.000 --> 18:09.000]  and Taliban generals and al-Qaeda generals
[18:09.000 --> 18:13.000]  would then arrest them, grab them, bag them,
[18:13.000 --> 18:17.000]  take them to the United States who knew that they were totally innocent
[18:17.000 --> 18:20.000]  and get in some cases as much as $40,000.
[18:20.000 --> 18:24.000]  Most of them was about $5,000 to then load them on C-130s
[18:24.000 --> 18:27.000]  and they were paid bounties and then fly them out
[18:27.000 --> 18:30.000]  to different black sites all over the world,
[18:30.000 --> 18:35.000]  Eastern Europe, Guantanamo Bay, and other areas for torture.
[18:35.000 --> 18:37.000]  They would also take them to camps
[18:37.000 --> 18:39.000]  and torture them to death inside Afghanistan.
[18:39.000 --> 18:43.000]  They would put, in one case, 3,000 of them inside containers
[18:43.000 --> 18:48.000]  in the hot sun and then in there in the high desert freezing cold at night
[18:48.000 --> 18:51.000]  and then a week later open up the door and they would all be dead
[18:51.000 --> 18:56.000]  and they would then mass grave, in one case, 3,000-plus people.
[18:56.000 --> 18:59.000]  Totally and completely innocent.
[19:02.000 --> 19:05.000]  Now, it's admitted, but Gennrich knows the average American
[19:05.000 --> 19:07.000]  can't find Afghanistan on the map, thinks it's in the Middle East,
[19:07.000 --> 19:10.000]  he knows you're ignorant, so he talks to you like that.
[19:10.000 --> 19:12.000]  He says, oh my gosh, we've got to not have courts,
[19:12.000 --> 19:15.000]  we've got to not have trials, we've got to not have any evidence
[19:15.000 --> 19:20.000]  or any habeas corpus or anything because al-Qaeda will get us.
[19:20.000 --> 19:23.000]  Then he says a city will be nuked.
[19:23.000 --> 19:27.000]  Wait a minute, our government in England helped give Pakistan nukes,
[19:27.000 --> 19:30.000]  that's admitted, Pakistan now has scores of them,
[19:30.000 --> 19:33.000]  they're threatening their neighbors, they have medium-range missiles
[19:33.000 --> 19:39.000]  that can hit Europe, hit Russia, hit China, hit India, their enemy.
[19:39.000 --> 19:43.000]  All of that's happening, but then they say,
[19:43.000 --> 19:46.000]  no, no, no, it's not Pakistan, al-Qaeda is going to nuke the US.
[19:46.000 --> 19:47.000]  When al-Qaeda doesn't even exist,
[19:47.000 --> 19:54.000]  but even if you believe their official story, they don't have nukes.
[19:54.000 --> 19:56.000]  When I learned that the accumulation of acidic waste
[19:56.000 --> 20:00.000]  was the likely cause of my painful joints, lack of energy and weight gain,
[20:00.000 --> 20:03.000]  I knew I would have to change to a more alkaline diet,
[20:03.000 --> 20:05.000]  but it just seems so difficult.
[20:05.000 --> 20:09.000]  Then a friend suggested I try a Jupiter water ionizer from Snyderhealth.com
[20:09.000 --> 20:12.000]  and detox my body even before I changed my diet
[20:12.000 --> 20:15.000]  by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[20:15.000 --> 20:18.000]  Drinking water? Now that's something I can handle.
[20:18.000 --> 20:21.000]  The guys at Snyderhealth took the time to explain all of the different options
[20:21.000 --> 20:23.000]  and helped me choose the ionizer that was right for me.
[20:23.000 --> 20:27.000]  I used my new Jupiter ionizer for everything, for drinking, for cooking,
[20:27.000 --> 20:30.000]  and since I've been drinking the water, I have more energy,
[20:30.000 --> 20:33.000]  my joint pains are gone, and I already lost 7 pounds,
[20:33.000 --> 20:35.000]  and my skin looks great.
[20:35.000 --> 20:40.000]  Give them a call today at 877-356-2508
[20:40.000 --> 20:42.000]  to find out which ionizer is right for you.
[20:42.000 --> 20:45.000]  They offer a full 30-day money-back guarantee and free shipping,
[20:45.000 --> 20:47.000]  so there's absolutely no risk.
[20:47.000 --> 20:50.000]  You can visit them on the web at Snyderhealth.com.
[20:50.000 --> 20:53.000]  That's S-N-Y-D-E-R-Health.com.
[20:53.000 --> 20:58.000]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[20:58.000 --> 21:03.000]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[21:03.000 --> 21:05.000]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[21:05.000 --> 21:08.000]  Could their objective be world domination?
[21:08.000 --> 21:12.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[21:12.000 --> 21:15.000]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[21:15.000 --> 21:20.000]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[21:22.000 --> 21:24.000]  For the first time in history,
[21:24.000 --> 21:28.000]  the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[21:28.000 --> 21:32.000]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[21:32.000 --> 21:34.000]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[21:34.000 --> 21:36.000]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money.
[21:36.000 --> 21:38.000]  They have all the money they need. They're after power.
[21:38.000 --> 21:40.000]  That's their after-easy.
[21:55.000 --> 21:57.000]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[21:57.000 --> 22:00.000]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors
[22:00.000 --> 22:02.000]  won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[22:02.000 --> 22:04.000]  That's right.
[22:04.000 --> 22:07.000]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[22:07.000 --> 22:11.000]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize
[22:11.000 --> 22:14.000]  the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[22:14.000 --> 22:18.000]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments,
[22:18.000 --> 22:22.000]  like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[22:22.000 --> 22:26.000]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets
[22:26.000 --> 22:28.000]  by keeping you in paper.
[22:28.000 --> 22:31.000]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement,
[22:31.000 --> 22:34.000]  call 1-800-686-2237.
[22:34.000 --> 22:38.000]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[22:38.000 --> 22:41.000]  Call 800-686-2237.
[22:41.000 --> 22:44.000]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[22:44.000 --> 22:47.000]  Call 800-686-2237.
[22:47.000 --> 23:02.000]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[23:36.000 --> 23:42.000]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[23:42.000 --> 23:47.000]  Get online at oilcompanysecret.com.
[23:47.000 --> 23:53.000]  Satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back and it's safe for all cars. Act now.
[23:53.000 --> 23:58.000]  We're back live.
[23:58.000 --> 24:01.000]  Newt Gennrich again said on Face The Nation,
[24:01.000 --> 24:07.000]  this court decision is a disaster which could cost us a city
[24:07.000 --> 24:11.000]  and the debate ought to be about whether you're prepared to lose an American city
[24:11.000 --> 24:16.040]  American city on behalf of five lawyers.
[24:16.040 --> 24:19.520]  He also then undermines the Supreme Court in one of the separation of powers, one of
[24:19.520 --> 24:25.080]  the branches of government, implying there are just five lawyers.
[24:25.080 --> 24:28.200]  And they are just five lawyers under Marbury versus Madison.
[24:28.200 --> 24:30.600]  Any law that violates Bill of Rights Constitution is null and void.
[24:30.600 --> 24:35.760]  But whenever they defend it, they are not just five lawyers.
[24:35.760 --> 24:40.560]  They have done everything they can to protect bin Laden, whether he's dead or alive.
[24:40.560 --> 24:42.160]  They ordered special forces.
[24:42.160 --> 24:43.160]  This is admitted.
[24:43.160 --> 24:45.720]  See, none of this is debatable.
[24:45.720 --> 24:52.080]  They ordered them to leave the supposed regions there on the Pakistan-Afghan border where
[24:52.080 --> 24:53.720]  he was staying.
[24:53.720 --> 24:55.960]  He supposedly was in Tora Bora.
[24:55.960 --> 25:00.460]  Of course, months before 9-11, British papers reported that British and U.S. diplomats were
[25:00.460 --> 25:09.840]  visiting with bin Laden and that he was being protected by U.S. special forces.
[25:09.840 --> 25:11.800]  And see, it's complex.
[25:11.800 --> 25:16.320]  And so it's just easier for Gendrige to sit up there and say, we can't have habeas corpus.
[25:16.320 --> 25:21.920]  We have to allow U.S. citizens to be secretly arrested, secretly tortured, or we're going
[25:21.920 --> 25:22.920]  to lose a city.
[25:22.920 --> 25:25.000]  We're going to have a city nuked.
[25:25.000 --> 25:27.760]  And that is the very definition of terrorism.
[25:27.760 --> 25:28.840]  They're terrorizing you.
[25:28.840 --> 25:33.760]  If you read the definition of terrorism, the classic definition, it is to carry out a violent
[25:33.760 --> 25:40.880]  action or to threaten a violent action if your political or economic demands are not
[25:40.880 --> 25:42.880]  met.
[25:42.880 --> 25:44.240]  And that's what they're doing.
[25:44.240 --> 25:45.880]  Go read the definition for terrorism.
[25:45.880 --> 25:47.680]  They say, give up all your liberties.
[25:47.680 --> 25:48.680]  Give up all your freedoms.
[25:48.680 --> 25:54.040]  Let us steal trillions out of the Pentagon coffers, out of the Pentagon pension funds
[25:54.040 --> 25:55.040]  and investments.
[25:55.040 --> 25:57.680]  Let us spend $3 trillion into a black hole with no-bid contracts.
[25:57.680 --> 26:00.840]  And then they play more games with the public's childlike minds.
[26:00.840 --> 26:04.000]  They say, oh, you don't want no-bid contracts.
[26:04.000 --> 26:05.480]  You want the French to get contracts.
[26:05.480 --> 26:07.040]  And we go, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[26:07.040 --> 26:09.600]  U.S. companies aren't allowed to bid.
[26:09.600 --> 26:13.040]  And then those companies, they claim are, quote, red, white, and blue, like Blackwater
[26:13.040 --> 26:18.040]  USA, changes its name to Blackwater worldwide and moves overseas.
[26:18.040 --> 26:22.280]  Or they say, Halliburton's U.S. And then for two years, it's moved to Dubai, just like
[26:22.280 --> 26:25.240]  Cheney's bought a house in Dubai.
[26:25.240 --> 26:29.760]  And they're still hailed as American companies.
[26:29.760 --> 26:31.000]  That is the globalist.
[26:31.000 --> 26:35.360]  Both parties that work together in tandem, Barack Obama's running around, calling to
[26:35.360 --> 26:41.380]  attack Iran, calling for attacking Pakistan.
[26:41.380 --> 26:45.080]  And they twist it and then claim that he is not hawkish enough.
[26:45.080 --> 26:48.200]  And I'm not saying vote for Barack Obama.
[26:48.200 --> 26:52.960]  The enemies of liberty and freedom, the enemies of the republic, get aid and comfort off of
[26:52.960 --> 26:59.480]  this WWF wrestling event that they have, where they stage these fights amongst themselves
[26:59.480 --> 27:04.280]  when the outcome of the election is already predetermined.
[27:04.280 --> 27:07.880]  And I just want to explain to the neocons out there that we have no future.
[27:07.880 --> 27:09.680]  And I'm talking about neocon followers.
[27:09.680 --> 27:14.680]  If you don't wake up to this fact, I'm going to talk about this later in the next segment,
[27:14.680 --> 27:18.240]  but just look at what they've done.
[27:18.240 --> 27:19.760]  Look at all of their policies.
[27:19.760 --> 27:22.040]  Is this pro-U.S.?
[27:22.040 --> 27:24.320]  Is this constitutional?
[27:24.320 --> 27:25.320]  Is this conservative?
[27:25.320 --> 27:30.960]  No, it doesn't resemble it in any way.
[27:30.960 --> 27:37.320]  I saw a new clip on YouTube last night from a little neocon named Gordon Boyer who's called
[27:37.320 --> 27:43.160]  for me to be arrested for treason months ago.
[27:43.160 --> 27:45.320]  And he's up there saying, we're conspiracy nuts.
[27:45.320 --> 27:47.280]  There's no plan to set up a world government.
[27:47.280 --> 27:51.880]  When Bush senior and everybody calls for a new world order, Bill Clinton, Gordon Brown,
[27:51.880 --> 27:57.800]  we're all calling for it currently, Henry Kissinger, that it doesn't mean a world government.
[27:57.800 --> 28:04.200]  That it means a community of Western nations, something like the League of Nations.
[28:04.200 --> 28:07.040]  Well, we have David Rockefeller's books he's written.
[28:07.040 --> 28:09.600]  We have the statements of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[28:09.600 --> 28:14.240]  We have hundreds of books and documents and German Chancellor's writing books like Helmut
[28:14.240 --> 28:19.200]  Schmidt saying a new world order is a world government run by private banks for their
[28:19.200 --> 28:25.320]  administrative convenience, removing national sovereignty and checks and balances on liberty.
[28:25.320 --> 28:31.320]  But if we can't get even conservative, you know, many pundits to admit the truth, what
[28:31.320 --> 28:33.600]  are we going to do?
[28:33.600 --> 28:37.960]  How are we going to turn this around when there's so much denial?
[28:37.960 --> 28:42.400]  I mean, do they deny that the World Trade Organization has more authority over our trade
[28:42.400 --> 28:46.680]  than our Congress and that it's been transferred via the Congress to that world government
[28:46.680 --> 28:48.320]  body?
[28:48.320 --> 28:53.600]  Can we deny that more and more of our decisions are being made on the international scene?
[28:53.600 --> 29:01.000]  Can we deny that the central private banks who engineered the latest currency crisis
[29:01.000 --> 29:07.760]  are calling for a world banking system with world regulatory governmental enforcement
[29:07.760 --> 29:09.960]  run by the bankers for their administrative convenience?
[29:09.960 --> 29:14.320]  Can we deny that they're proposing global carbon taxes and global carbon assessments
[29:14.320 --> 29:18.480]  and bureaucrats in our daily lives and that we will buy our carbon credits from the private
[29:18.480 --> 29:19.760]  central banks?
[29:19.760 --> 29:22.520]  They are becoming the world government right now.
[29:22.520 --> 29:23.760]  They're making the changes.
[29:23.760 --> 29:25.480]  It's happening.
[29:25.480 --> 29:31.400]  And it doesn't matter how many IMF World Bank documents we have released in March of 2002
[29:31.400 --> 29:32.400]  stating all of this.
[29:32.400 --> 29:37.400]  It doesn't matter how many Club of Rome documents, how many CFR public publications.
[29:37.400 --> 29:41.400]  The neocon followers have signed on to this fraud so they can't say they were wrong.
[29:41.400 --> 29:44.320]  They can't admit they were wrong.
[29:44.320 --> 29:45.600]  We're on the march.
[29:45.600 --> 29:48.000]  The Empire's on the run.
[29:48.000 --> 29:54.360]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:54.360 --> 29:57.240]  Terror Storm, a history of government sponsored terror.

[33:37.160 --> 33:54.600]  Well my goodness, let me tell you the news, my head's been wet with the midnight dew,
[33:54.600 --> 33:55.600]  I've been down on bended knee, talking to the man from Calilee, he spoke to me of the
[33:55.600 --> 34:01.040]  voice so sweet, I thought I heard the shuffle of angels sweet, he called my name and my
[34:01.040 --> 34:08.400]  heart stood still, when he said, John go do my will, go tell that long tongue liar, go
[34:08.400 --> 34:15.080]  and tell that midnight writer, tell the rambler, the gambler, the back writer, tell him that
[34:15.080 --> 34:22.280]  God's gonna cut him down, tell him that God's gonna cut him down.
[34:22.280 --> 34:30.600]  You can run on for a long time, run on for a long time, run on for a long time.
[34:30.600 --> 34:38.520]  Soon I'll leave, I gotta cut you down, soon I'll leave, I gotta cut you down.
[34:38.520 --> 34:39.520]  Thank you for joining us.
[34:39.520 --> 34:45.160]  You may throw your rock, hide your hand, working in the dark against your fellow man, but it's
[34:45.160 --> 34:50.760]  sure it's got made black and white, what's done in the dark will be brought to the light.
[34:50.760 --> 34:51.760]  You can run on for a long time.
[34:51.760 --> 34:58.560]  That's right, new world order, controlled leftist, controlled right wingers, run on for a long
[34:58.560 --> 34:59.560]  time.
[34:59.560 --> 35:02.560]  They're controlled by the global corporate parasitic slave state.
[35:02.560 --> 35:05.480]  Soon I'll leave, I gotta cut you down.
[35:05.480 --> 35:12.680]  And it's time to stop denying that our masters are hiding their hand, ladies and gentlemen.
[35:12.680 --> 35:18.200]  They're doing their wicked deeds by stealth, but more and more of it is coming to light
[35:18.200 --> 35:24.440]  because they're very close to bringing their world government into fruition.
[35:24.440 --> 35:28.480]  They are very, very close to bringing their new world order in.
[35:28.480 --> 35:30.640]  Everything we said they would do, they're doing.
[35:30.640 --> 35:35.880]  The club of Rome, the council on foreign relations, the IMF, the World Bank, David Rockefeller's
[35:35.880 --> 35:39.800]  own autobiography written four years ago, they brag how they're going to bring in a
[35:39.800 --> 35:45.520]  world tax on currency transfers, a world tax on all human carbon output.
[35:45.520 --> 35:50.320]  That includes your breathing, your respiration, the New York Times called it a tax on breathing,
[35:50.320 --> 35:53.080]  but then so that they supported it.
[35:53.080 --> 35:59.120]  We see Pat Robertson doing TV ads with Al Sharpton saying we've got to do something about
[35:59.120 --> 36:00.760]  climate change.
[36:00.760 --> 36:04.600]  We've got Newt Gainrich coming out saying he supports it doing TV ads.
[36:04.600 --> 36:08.520]  We've got all these quote conservatives like John McCain pushing for open borders, gun
[36:08.520 --> 36:13.640]  control, but all these supposed mainline conservative groups are supporting him for president.
[36:13.640 --> 36:15.760]  And they're only doing that because of the false choice.
[36:15.760 --> 36:20.560]  Oh, what are we going to do, vote for Barack Obama?
[36:20.560 --> 36:24.760]  Instead of politically revolting and taking this country back, you will now compromise
[36:24.760 --> 36:27.560]  your values, compromise your ideas.
[36:27.560 --> 36:33.160]  How do they sell the average conservative American or the average liberal American on
[36:33.160 --> 36:35.360]  going along with all of this tyranny?
[36:35.360 --> 36:40.480]  Well, first off, they play the two sides off against each other in kind of a football
[36:40.480 --> 36:46.240]  mentality, rah, rah, rah, our team against your team, but the league itself with only
[36:46.240 --> 36:51.600]  two teams is owned by the globalist, is controlled, is financed by them.
[36:51.600 --> 36:55.960]  And so that's why you can't ever get any real change.
[36:55.960 --> 37:00.240]  And all I'm here is doing saying basically it's like a prize fight, a heavyweight prize
[37:00.240 --> 37:04.920]  fight where Don King owns both fighters in the fight, which most of the fights he does
[37:04.920 --> 37:09.560]  now, and that's killed viewership and even some of its profits because people know there's
[37:09.560 --> 37:14.560]  a good chance on any given match that it's staged.
[37:14.560 --> 37:19.000]  And they've been caught staging boxing events, not a conspiracy theory, a conspiracy fact.
[37:19.000 --> 37:21.840]  Well, it's the same thing here.
[37:21.840 --> 37:28.200]  Instead of looking at the two fighters in the ring, look and see is Don King running it?
[37:28.200 --> 37:30.920]  Is he in control of it?
[37:30.920 --> 37:32.800]  And that's the main point I'm trying to make here.
[37:32.800 --> 37:39.600]  But what happens is liberals fight with conservatives to get Bill Clinton elected in 1992, 1993.
[37:39.600 --> 37:43.080]  And then no matter what Bill Clinton did, what corruption he was involved in, no matter
[37:43.080 --> 37:47.320]  what horrible things he engaged in, they still defended him.
[37:47.320 --> 37:51.200]  They still supported him because it was their team.
[37:51.200 --> 37:52.320]  It was their boy.
[37:52.320 --> 37:53.800]  It was somebody they'd voted for.
[37:53.800 --> 37:59.520]  So no matter what evil he carried out, they now were compromised psychologically and they
[37:59.520 --> 38:05.400]  had shined on the dotted line and so they were committed to continue to support him.
[38:05.400 --> 38:10.360]  Now, years later after Bill Clinton has been less politicized and has lost some of his
[38:10.360 --> 38:14.840]  power, every Democrat I talked to knows he's corrupt and hates him.
[38:14.840 --> 38:20.920]  But they couldn't see that when he was in office because they were psychologically wedded
[38:20.920 --> 38:24.040]  to him.
[38:24.040 --> 38:26.200]  And it's the same thing with conservatives.
[38:26.200 --> 38:27.640]  Most of them were good people.
[38:27.640 --> 38:28.800]  They support our sovereignty.
[38:28.800 --> 38:30.400]  They support our Second Amendment.
[38:30.400 --> 38:31.640]  They mean well.
[38:31.640 --> 38:33.640]  They were scared by 9-11.
[38:33.640 --> 38:35.000]  They were scared by the attacks.
[38:35.000 --> 38:36.000]  Who wasn't?
[38:36.000 --> 38:40.080]  And then they were told, well, we're going to go have a war and now it's okay to bring
[38:40.080 --> 38:44.440]  your American flags back out, the same government that had demonized flag waivers suddenly said
[38:44.440 --> 38:47.320]  it was okay but now the flag symbolized the police state.
[38:47.320 --> 38:53.960]  Now the flag symbolized premeditated, unprovoked wars against sovereign nations.
[38:53.960 --> 38:59.060]  Now the flag symbolized the torture, the torture of children and secret arrest and they signed
[38:59.060 --> 39:00.060]  on to that.
[39:00.060 --> 39:05.720]  And they gave us Hollywood and TV icons like Jack Bauer and 24 so that we could participate
[39:05.720 --> 39:11.360]  in torture simulations, you know, being mesmerized, being hypnotized, being conditioned.
[39:11.360 --> 39:15.040]  And Homeland Security, years after I made the point, they themselves admitted that Jack
[39:15.040 --> 39:20.200]  Bauer was their mascot, that Jack Bauer had politically sold their ideas, that they had
[39:20.200 --> 39:27.280]  parties at the Justice Department, televised on C-SPAN, celebrating 24 and its effect on
[39:27.280 --> 39:30.840]  the public.
[39:30.840 --> 39:35.600]  George Bush is going to leave office soon and all of these tyrannical powers that Republicans,
[39:35.600 --> 39:39.360]  many of you have supported, are going to be handed over to Barack Obama or whoever else
[39:39.360 --> 39:40.360]  gets into office.
[39:40.360 --> 39:44.840]  They're going to be handed over to John McCain.
[39:44.840 --> 39:50.640]  And while you're busy terrified and horrified of al-Qaeda hiding under rocks and under your
[39:50.640 --> 39:55.080]  table and under your bed and in your closet, they are going to be busy dismantling our
[39:55.080 --> 40:00.240]  country, bringing in carbon taxes, bringing in greenhouse gas taxes, bringing in more
[40:00.240 --> 40:08.400]  regulations, hiring more police, building more prisons, raising our taxes, launching
[40:08.400 --> 40:16.640]  new wars, sucking the pension funds and raiding and looting the economy on a greater scale.
[40:16.640 --> 40:27.200]  I watched in horror in 2002 and 2003 when Secretary of the Treasury at that time, Snow,
[40:27.200 --> 40:32.920]  Andrew O'Neill was run off for speaking out about the premeditated plans to attack Iraq
[40:32.920 --> 40:35.800]  and get the oil.
[40:35.800 --> 40:41.320]  And I'll never forget, in a Kansas City hotel room up there for an event, watching them
[40:41.320 --> 40:45.680]  say, we want a weak dollar, we are going to have a policy for a weak dollar, and the dollar
[40:45.680 --> 40:47.400]  began sliding at that point.
[40:47.400 --> 40:50.340]  Why do they want that?
[40:50.340 --> 40:54.200]  Because then they can accelerate the amount of debt this nation has and at least make
[40:54.200 --> 40:57.880]  an attempt to pay it off, that way they can also, because they are globalists, they are
[40:57.880 --> 41:01.440]  international, they just flap a flag in your face to neutralize you politically, so you
[41:01.440 --> 41:03.440]  will accept their operations.
[41:03.440 --> 41:07.800]  They can then come in and buy up the roads, the ports, the infrastructure, the companies,
[41:07.800 --> 41:14.640]  the real estate at pennies on the dollar, and that's now happening.
[41:14.640 --> 41:20.200]  I get emails and see clips on YouTube and hear talk show hosts say that we are liars,
[41:20.200 --> 41:24.120]  the dollar hasn't been devalued or that we are traders to say it's been devalued or
[41:24.120 --> 41:26.760]  now some are admitting the dollar has been devalued, they are saying it's our fault for
[41:26.760 --> 41:32.600]  talking about it, or it's our fault the stock market is going down, I mean it's crazy, I'm
[41:32.600 --> 41:36.840]  talking about real geopolitical things that are happening.
[41:36.840 --> 41:41.480]  The new world order is real, the IMF and World Bank are real, the European Union is real,
[41:41.480 --> 41:45.400]  the fact that Europe has voted it down and wants out of it and they won't let them out
[41:45.400 --> 41:48.760]  of it, the governments are dictatorial, that's real.
[41:48.760 --> 41:53.120]  The fact that last year Bush at the White House on the South Lawn signed agreements
[41:53.120 --> 41:59.320]  with Barroso, the head of the EU and Merkel, the head of Germany to start merging the North
[41:59.320 --> 42:01.760]  American Union with the European Union is real.
[42:01.760 --> 42:07.600]  The video is in end game, judicial watch had to sue to get some of the documents from the
[42:07.600 --> 42:13.840]  SPP, September 24, 2006 and their first agenda was to keep it secret, to implement it by
[42:13.840 --> 42:20.280]  stealth, we have the smoking gun, but conservatives have signed on to fake republicanism, they
[42:20.280 --> 42:24.800]  have signed on to torture, they've signed on to war, they've signed on to saying it
[42:24.800 --> 42:29.000]  isn't real, they're now signing on saying global warming is real and we've got to go
[42:29.000 --> 42:36.340]  ahead and accept the tax because they can't admit that they were wrong, they can't admit
[42:36.340 --> 42:41.520]  that they are going along with this new world order.
[42:41.520 --> 42:46.560]  They can't admit that our government in 79 created al-Qaeda and that in the 50s went
[42:46.560 --> 42:51.880]  in with the British and radicalized Muslim groups to overthrow mainline secular governments
[42:51.880 --> 42:58.240]  and put extremist regimes in because they would work with the West, they can't admit
[42:58.240 --> 43:02.000]  that our government with the British put in Saudi Arabia, they can't admit the over-throws
[43:02.000 --> 43:06.520]  that the criminals that run our government orchestrated in Iran, they can't admit that
[43:06.520 --> 43:13.440]  the CIA created al-Qaeda and expanded them to attack the Russians in 79 when it's declassified,
[43:13.440 --> 43:17.080]  they can't admit that the White House for four and a half years has been commanding
[43:17.080 --> 43:21.720]  four al-Qaeda groups attacking Iran while the media says Iran is al-Qaeda when they're
[43:21.720 --> 43:24.320]  Shiite, the opposite group.
[43:24.320 --> 43:29.120]  You have a defenseless public that don't know the basics of the world, the basics of the
[43:29.120 --> 43:39.840]  world power structure, the admitted basics, you have a public trained to deny basic realities.
[43:39.840 --> 43:47.320]  You've got a public, even when there's video of Benazar Budo being machine gunned, they
[43:47.320 --> 43:52.040]  show the video and still lie and say she hit her head and say al-Qaeda did it.
[43:52.040 --> 43:56.640]  They talk to you like you're five-year-olds.
[43:56.640 --> 44:01.880]  The country is being dismantled, the country is dying, get past the labels of liberal and
[44:01.880 --> 44:06.960]  conservative and realize that the Fortune 100 are international, they are bigger than
[44:06.960 --> 44:12.520]  most nations, together they're bigger than the top 10 nations combined in their wealth.
[44:12.520 --> 44:15.800]  They have private intelligence agencies.
[44:15.800 --> 44:20.040]  They have created myriads of new federal agencies that aren't even commissioned or chartered
[44:20.040 --> 44:23.760]  by Congress who do whatever they want.
[44:23.760 --> 44:29.520]  They are looting and parasitically feeding on all of us and there isn't much time.
[44:29.520 --> 44:31.440]  They're folding the country up.
[44:31.440 --> 44:36.660]  Let me break it down to you, neocons and liberals very simply.
[44:36.660 --> 44:41.280]  They took the U.S.'s name, our energy, our wealth, our fiat currency and they bought
[44:41.280 --> 44:46.920]  the world up with it and now they're leaving us holding the financial bag.
[44:46.920 --> 44:52.000]  In case we revolt over this as the news is announced to us, they have militarized the
[44:52.000 --> 44:56.480]  police and taught the police there's no First Amendment or right to demonstrate.
[44:56.480 --> 45:00.200]  Now they're coming in against the web and attacking free speech, saying people that
[45:00.200 --> 45:05.160]  disagree with the government should be arrested and put in forced labor camps, a la the morning
[45:05.160 --> 45:09.520]  Joe and Michael Savage and the rest of them.
[45:09.520 --> 45:15.880]  They claim we are involved in sedition because we can simply read international treaties
[45:15.880 --> 45:19.240]  and agreements and see that our country is being dismantled.
[45:19.240 --> 45:22.400]  Our country has a wrecking ball being taken to it right now.
[45:22.400 --> 45:28.600]  Frankly, it's probably already irreversible and the establishment knows that a lot of
[45:28.600 --> 45:29.920]  people are waking up.
[45:29.920 --> 45:34.040]  The majority have woken up to the fact they've been lied to and they have a horrible feeling
[45:34.040 --> 45:39.320]  and just what they can prove to themselves is so horrible that they don't know what
[45:39.320 --> 45:42.000]  to do.
[45:42.000 --> 45:48.080]  There isn't a lot of time left and so getting past the childish fights and the childish
[45:48.080 --> 45:52.720]  arguments about who's right and who's wrong, I am begging mainline liberals and mainline
[45:52.720 --> 45:58.000]  conservatives to please get David Rockefeller's book published four years ago as memoirs and
[45:58.000 --> 45:59.000]  read it.
[45:59.000 --> 46:02.520]  I'm begging you to get Brzezinski's new book he put out last year where they admitted
[46:02.520 --> 46:07.000]  they created Al Qaeda and attacked the Russians to make them attack.
[46:07.000 --> 46:11.480]  I'm begging you to read the Chicago Tribune where they admit, the NSA admits that Israel
[46:11.480 --> 46:16.440]  attacked the USS Liberty to try to sink it and blame it on Egypt to start a wider war.
[46:16.440 --> 46:20.080]  Now admitted we were right about that, we were right about Gulf of Tonkin, we were right
[46:20.080 --> 46:21.080]  about everything.
[46:21.080 --> 46:22.640]  This isn't our government.
[46:22.640 --> 46:28.000]  These are criminals that have taken control of our government and are using our credit
[46:28.000 --> 46:32.320]  to build their world government and then leaving us holding the bill.
[46:32.320 --> 46:40.920]  It's very, very simple in the final analysis and I love my children, I love this country
[46:40.920 --> 46:48.680]  and I'm begging neocons who are on propaganda bureau payrolls who were hired because they're
[46:48.680 --> 46:53.160]  vitriolic and they believe in all of this to really have a gut check and really get
[46:53.160 --> 46:57.800]  past your emotion and just admit that you've been conned and admit that you've been wrong
[46:57.800 --> 47:02.240]  and admit that the country is going in the wrong direction.
[47:02.240 --> 47:05.720]  They don't just cop out, I talked to so many of them and they say, yeah, we know a lot
[47:05.720 --> 47:07.840]  of what you're saying is true.
[47:07.840 --> 47:12.000]  This is generals and colonels and FBI people and others but what are we going to do?
[47:12.000 --> 47:15.280]  We're just going to follow our orders, it's not my fault, it's your fault, you need to
[47:15.280 --> 47:19.480]  go get the bad guys out of office, you know, it's the people's job.
[47:19.480 --> 47:22.480]  Well we've got electronic voting machines that have been proven to be fraudulent.
[47:22.480 --> 47:25.720]  Their own executives going public and saying they were hired for fraud, they've been caught
[47:25.720 --> 47:26.720]  for fraud.
[47:26.720 --> 47:31.720]  Every case we've called in New Mexico or Ohio that was fraud, it's turned out was fraud.
[47:31.720 --> 47:39.000]  A pack of criminals are in control, presidents are nothing but their minions, their puppets,
[47:39.000 --> 47:46.240]  their marionettes and I'm just begging everybody to really assess how far down we've gone and
[47:46.240 --> 47:53.440]  to ask yourselves, do you like the policy of devaluing our dollar, do you know what
[47:53.440 --> 47:59.360]  that means to your savings, your bank account, your future, that's why the oil prices are
[47:59.360 --> 48:02.800]  so high.
[48:02.800 --> 48:08.920]  That's the biggest reason in the equation, the biggest input in the equation, 70 plus
[48:08.920 --> 48:12.120]  percent of it, yeah there's a lot of global speculation going on because the dollar's
[48:12.120 --> 48:17.440]  imploding everywhere and people are trying to dump out of dollars and getting into something.
[48:17.440 --> 48:22.160]  It's also the fact that Americans pay four to five times more than anybody else for prescription
[48:22.160 --> 48:28.120]  drugs, we pay four dollars and ten cents for 87 octane, they pay forty something cents
[48:28.120 --> 48:37.000]  in Mexico, twenty something cents in Brazil, fourteen cents in Venezuela.
[48:37.000 --> 48:43.480]  It's also that we are seen as the schmucks, I've told the story many times, I'll say
[48:43.480 --> 48:47.720]  it again, remember the right whale, why was it called the right whale, it was the right
[48:47.720 --> 48:53.080]  one to hunt, the right one to harpoon for hundreds of years until it was almost extinct.
[48:53.080 --> 48:57.240]  Other whales would fight, other whales would dive, other whales would run, other whales
[48:57.240 --> 49:02.200]  knew, the right whale is a playful whale, it's got a lot of blubber, a lot of oil, it'll
[49:02.200 --> 49:06.120]  come up to your ship, it'll be friendly to you, while you kill it, while you kill its
[49:06.120 --> 49:12.880]  calves and that's who we are, we're the right whale folks, we are the great great grandchildren
[49:12.880 --> 49:17.240]  of people that built a country, carved out a continent, amazing individuals, the world
[49:17.240 --> 49:21.840]  around historians studied us and said we were the best, we were the most amazing, the most
[49:21.840 --> 49:28.400]  inventions, the most hard working and we had liberty to some extent and we are now mindless
[49:28.400 --> 49:37.720]  dumbed down, mesmerized, hypnotized creatures who have invested in a lie, who have denied,
[49:37.720 --> 49:43.320]  who have rationalized, who have made excuses about what's happening, lazily and now we're
[49:43.320 --> 49:48.040]  like lambs to a slaughter, we're like right whales harpoon being drug into the boats,
[49:48.040 --> 49:56.720]  we are boiled down, rendered for our oil, being a sanguiated
[49:56.720 --> 50:00.080]  and I've committed myself to this fight against the new world order, I don't like the death
[50:00.080 --> 50:05.200]  threats, I don't like the open death threats, I don't like the White House talking points
[50:05.200 --> 50:10.920]  directed at me and others but in a way I do like it because it lets me know, I personally
[50:10.920 --> 50:14.440]  don't like it but overall I like it because it lets me know we're having an effect, it
[50:14.440 --> 50:17.760]  lets me know that we're fighting the new world order, it lets me know that we're getting
[50:17.760 --> 50:24.440]  their attention, it lets me know we're striking at the real enemy of this republic, it's the
[50:24.440 --> 50:29.280]  only country we've got, you know the irish god bless them, they still got paper ballots,
[50:29.280 --> 50:34.120]  they just shot down the EU expansion, we have to shoot down the north american union but
[50:34.120 --> 50:39.000]  first we have to get past the fact that the enemies lying telling us this isn't an assault,
[50:39.000 --> 50:43.640]  telling us that they're not attacking our lines while they're doing it but I want the
[50:43.640 --> 50:48.400]  neocons to know those that have sold out to evil, we're never going to stop and you're
[50:48.400 --> 50:51.760]  going to fall, you're going to be brought to justice, we'll be right back with more
[50:51.760 --> 50:54.440]  info.
[50:54.440 --> 50:58.920]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloading film in internet history comes

[51:14.600 --> 51:18.680]  and the true perpetrators of the horrendous crime are brought to justice.

[51:50.880 --> 51:56.200]  tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[51:56.200 --> 52:06.000]  Another untold story here it comes, another untold story here it comes, another untold
[52:06.000 --> 52:14.920]  story that you have not been told from another untoldstory.com.
[52:14.920 --> 52:21.240]  The greatest storyteller once told a sad story or shall we say described a sad scene, a scene
[52:21.240 --> 52:22.920]  of the deceit.
[52:22.920 --> 52:28.240]  He warned of deceivers when he said beware of the false prophets who come to you in sheep's
[52:28.240 --> 52:31.560]  clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves.
[52:31.560 --> 52:35.380]  Then he described the sad scene of the deceit.
[52:35.380 --> 52:40.120]  But everyone who says to me Lord, Lord will enter the kingdom of heaven but he who does
[52:40.120 --> 52:43.560]  the will of my Father who is in heaven.
[52:43.560 --> 52:47.760]  Many will say to me on that day Lord, Lord did we not prophesy in your name and in your
[52:47.760 --> 52:53.960]  name cast out demons and in your name perform many miracles and then I will declare to them
[52:53.960 --> 52:56.260]  I never knew you.
[52:56.260 --> 53:01.840]  Could the preachers in our land today be deceivers and what is one of the possible main common
[53:01.840 --> 53:06.760]  denominator deceptions in most churches in America today?
[53:06.760 --> 53:10.680]  A deception that has kept people from doing the will of the Father.
[53:10.680 --> 53:17.400]  No one seems to be telling but we tell at anotheruntoldstory.com but we must warn you
[53:17.400 --> 53:22.480]  you will find that you might become mad when you hear the story.
[53:22.480 --> 53:29.400]  Some who like the lie and deception don't want it told but we tell it anyway at anotheruntoldstory.com.
[53:29.400 --> 53:50.240]  Anotheruntoldstory.com, it's quite a story.
[54:24.840 --> 54:28.960]  Your sixth sense is telling you that evil is all around you, that you're under threat.
[54:28.960 --> 54:34.920]  Everybody says they feel it, it's because we're on the edge of world depression, they've
[54:34.920 --> 54:40.840]  hired 26,000 preachers to tell their flocks to hand their guns in and go to FEMA camps.
[54:40.840 --> 54:42.960]  That's admitted.
[54:42.960 --> 54:47.600]  Think about how far we've come, think about how deep into tyranny we are but also think
[54:47.600 --> 54:54.280]  about how far the cause of liberty has come, how many people are waking up.
[54:54.280 --> 55:00.840]  I'm going to cover another subject for the next four minutes and Bermas is going to be
[55:00.840 --> 55:01.840]  in here.
[55:01.840 --> 55:05.240]  And it's just this, I want to thank you the listeners for all you've done.
[55:05.240 --> 55:10.360]  It is you the listeners of this show that have spread the word about this radio show
[55:10.360 --> 55:13.840]  about the websites infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[55:13.840 --> 55:18.480]  You are the reason we've had the success we've had, you're the reason the enemy is
[55:18.480 --> 55:26.200]  attacking us because you have made us effective.
[55:26.200 --> 55:29.760]  And I never thought when I started out on this journey 13 years ago in my fight against
[55:29.760 --> 55:35.480]  the New World Order that as we became successful, a lot of our own ranks, people who want to
[55:35.480 --> 55:40.680]  be leaders, people who have websites or radio shows or who are somewhat prominent, would
[55:40.680 --> 55:47.520]  become so jealous and so angry with those of us that had become the most effective.
[55:47.520 --> 55:49.560]  Those of us that are in the greatest danger.
[55:49.560 --> 55:53.240]  Those of us that are on the very front line, the very tip of the spear.
[55:53.240 --> 55:57.800]  I want to encourage listeners to not even debate or fight with the legions of people
[55:57.800 --> 56:04.440]  that tell thousands of lies and invent new ones daily out of whole cloth against us.
[56:04.440 --> 56:07.840]  They are doing that because if you talk to the public and you say, who woke you up to
[56:07.840 --> 56:14.360]  the New World Order eight times out of 10 or more, but eight times out of 10 conservative,
[56:14.360 --> 56:19.600]  they will say Alex Jones first woke me up because we were able through the web, through
[56:19.600 --> 56:23.080]  videos, through the fact that we were some of the first to be posting videos on the web
[56:23.080 --> 56:26.720]  10 years ago.
[56:26.720 --> 56:31.080]  We have been able, thanks to you, the listeners making copies of films before the age of YouTube
[56:31.080 --> 56:35.640]  and Google, even before that, to have the greatest effect.
[56:35.640 --> 56:38.640]  And a lot of people in this movement who are prominent, get sick of hearing my name, get
[56:38.640 --> 56:43.000]  sick of hearing about Info Wars, and they really are in this for the wrong reason.
[56:43.000 --> 56:49.720]  I understand that with trepidation, with my heart beating fast, I see our web stats growing.
[56:49.720 --> 56:51.840]  I see our listenership exploding.
[56:51.840 --> 56:57.320]  I realize I put myself in greater degrees of harm and danger.
[56:57.320 --> 56:58.320]  I am humbled.
[56:58.320 --> 56:59.320]  I am chastened.
[56:59.320 --> 57:01.800]  I'm sure you've noticed I've been more focused.
[57:01.800 --> 57:03.280]  I have tried to do a good job.
[57:03.280 --> 57:06.440]  I'm certainly not perfect and I make mistakes.
[57:06.440 --> 57:10.360]  And it isn't that I mind being attacked or lied about.
[57:10.360 --> 57:15.160]  It's that I know it is so destructive.
[57:15.160 --> 57:19.680]  And so I ask listeners not to waste your time defending me.
[57:19.680 --> 57:22.240]  If you care about me, I know a lot of you spend a lot of your time defending me on the
[57:22.240 --> 57:25.680]  message boards and on the chat rooms and the comment pages.
[57:25.680 --> 57:28.360]  Don't do that.
[57:28.360 --> 57:29.640]  Let people attack me.
[57:29.640 --> 57:34.960]  Let them spend their time and energy in our own sick movement, the sick sections of it.
[57:34.960 --> 57:42.040]  It's a beautiful movement overall for liberty and justice and goodness and love.
[57:42.040 --> 57:46.040]  Spend your time waking other people up.
[57:46.040 --> 57:48.920]  Leave me behind.
[57:48.920 --> 57:52.920]  Now when I'm being death-threaded on air by a national host or other people are defendants
[57:52.920 --> 57:56.800]  and spread the word about the show and what we do, but don't waste your time debating
[57:56.800 --> 58:04.160]  or arguing with people that invent lies against us, unsubstantiated frauds.
[58:04.160 --> 58:06.920]  Guys that a lot of them are COINTELPRO, a lot of them are agents, a lot of them are people
[58:06.920 --> 58:10.080]  that picked up on the COINTELPRO and have been fooled.
[58:10.080 --> 58:14.640]  I'm going to spend five more minutes on this and then Mark Dyson will be on air and you'll
[58:14.640 --> 58:15.640]  have Jason Burma.
[58:15.640 --> 58:16.640]  It's coming up in five minutes.
[58:16.640 --> 58:21.720]  But I want to finish up briefly talking about this because it's one of the sicknesses holding
[58:21.720 --> 58:28.800]  us back and I don't want the gathering armies of people attacking me to distract you from
[58:28.800 --> 58:29.800]  the battle.
[58:29.800 --> 58:41.400]  So we'll come back and talk about that in 70 seconds.
[58:41.400 --> 58:59.400]  Thank you guys.

[59:58.200 --> 1:00:06.200]  Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio
[1:00:06.200 --> 1:00:16.760]  Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:16.760 --> 1:00:21.600]  We are a very sick society. There's a lot of good in it still, but there's also a lot
[1:00:21.600 --> 1:00:28.320]  of sickness. For a lot of people, fighting the New World Order is a social movement.
[1:00:28.320 --> 1:00:35.360]  It's a hobby. It's about being a leader themselves and being prominent. And I'm sad to say that
[1:00:35.360 --> 1:00:41.280]  most of the people that attack me and invent one new lie after another, or more often than
[1:00:41.280 --> 1:00:46.960]  not twist things and add truth in with lies, that most of them are not government agents.
[1:00:46.960 --> 1:00:50.760]  You know, when government agents attack us and big mainstream media outlets attack us,
[1:00:50.760 --> 1:00:56.120]  people know they're liars. They've been discredited. And so it really only points people at our
[1:00:56.120 --> 1:01:03.360]  websites InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com. It only lets people know that we're a place
[1:01:03.360 --> 1:01:07.680]  that needs to be checked out and looked into. But I also get frustrated because we wake
[1:01:07.680 --> 1:01:12.400]  up so many millions of people a year with this radio show on the websites that we wake
[1:01:12.400 --> 1:01:20.640]  people up, but they're still lacking in knowledge. They're lacking in discernment. They are what
[1:01:20.640 --> 1:01:26.120]  you'd call rookies to all of this. And so I wake up so many people, millions of people,
[1:01:26.120 --> 1:01:31.600]  my listeners wake up millions of people, only to turn them over to the rotten Nairdoo Wells
[1:01:31.600 --> 1:01:43.040]  who pockmark so much of our movement. We need every able body man and woman who's awake
[1:01:43.040 --> 1:01:47.680]  to what's happening, to wake people up that vaccines are not mandatory and they're poisonous,
[1:01:47.680 --> 1:01:52.200]  that sodium fluoride does brain damage you, that GMO foods are hurting us, that hormones
[1:01:52.200 --> 1:01:58.520]  in the milk are hurting our children, that our borders are being dissolved, that they're
[1:01:58.520 --> 1:02:04.200]  trying to launch a war against Iran. We need to have our websites and our radio shows be
[1:02:04.200 --> 1:02:09.280]  focused on issues so that when people tune in, they don't think we're just a bunch of
[1:02:09.280 --> 1:02:21.080]  in fighting nuts. So that's why I'm saying to you out there that you need to stay focused
[1:02:21.080 --> 1:02:26.320]  on real issues and I wouldn't even spend your time defending me. I would spend your
[1:02:26.320 --> 1:02:34.600]  time trying to warn your fellow man about the New World Order because I don't want myself
[1:02:34.600 --> 1:02:41.080]  to become a distraction or to become a diversion. I don't want it to all be about Alex Jones.
[1:02:41.080 --> 1:02:45.760]  I do want it to be about our model of fighting the New World Order, which is getting people
[1:02:45.760 --> 1:02:51.600]  moving and taking action that has been so effective. The formula that we organically
[1:02:51.600 --> 1:02:59.760]  by accident came up with. You know, we had the money bomb and raised $250,000 which sounds
[1:02:59.760 --> 1:03:03.600]  like a lot but it's dropping the bucket to start a TV show and I appreciate what you
[1:03:03.600 --> 1:03:10.120]  did. That made people come out of the woodwork and attack me and I feel so sorry for them.
[1:03:10.120 --> 1:03:15.160]  People I've supported, people I've promoted, as we get bigger and bigger, as we have a
[1:03:15.160 --> 1:03:20.520]  greater effect, that's only going to intensify. It's not going to go away. People say, well,
[1:03:20.520 --> 1:03:23.880]  why don't you defend yourself? Why don't you come out and talk about the lies that have
[1:03:23.880 --> 1:03:27.120]  been told about you? Well, the nature of the Internet and the way things work is you can
[1:03:27.120 --> 1:03:32.200]  expose a lie a hundred times. It just comes back over and over again. It takes people
[1:03:32.200 --> 1:03:36.800]  time to just learn who the liars are for themselves and that's something you've got to do. I just
[1:03:36.800 --> 1:03:40.680]  encourage you when you go to a website that all they do is attack other patriots and say
[1:03:40.680 --> 1:03:45.920]  they're the best and everybody else is bad. Ignore it. Don't go to it. Don't spend your
[1:03:45.920 --> 1:03:51.760]  time fighting and ninning amongst ourselves. We need to spend our time going up against
[1:03:51.760 --> 1:03:58.560]  the New World Order. If you want to help us just buy the books, buy the videos, make copies
[1:03:58.560 --> 1:04:03.360]  of my films, spread the free videos that are on the web around everybody and just work
[1:04:03.360 --> 1:04:07.320]  that much harder to get our information out because we're hitting pay dirt here in the
[1:04:07.320 --> 1:04:13.640]  Info War. We're on target. We're having an effect. We're bringing in a giant harvest
[1:04:13.640 --> 1:04:18.720]  of mines and souls that are being unlocked and so let's redouble our efforts doing that.
[1:04:18.720 --> 1:04:22.480]  We know it's upsetting the globalist. We know it's hurting them. Spread in game. Spread

[1:04:29.440 --> 1:04:33.320]  Tell them about the private fellow reserve that's now becoming a global government. Tell
[1:04:33.320 --> 1:04:41.800]  them about the global carbon tax. Stay on issue and ignore those that whether you like
[1:04:41.800 --> 1:04:45.880]  it or not. I guess I'm the leader who try to tear down the leader to hurt the movement.
[1:04:45.880 --> 1:04:54.080]  All right. Jason Burmuss will begin with Mark Dye. Stay with us. It is a big idea. A New
[1:04:54.080 --> 1:05:01.600]  World Order in the near future. Earth is dominated by powerful government. It's known as the
[1:05:01.600 --> 1:05:07.960]  Builder Bird. But their objective being world domination. For thousands of years their dark
[1:05:07.960 --> 1:05:13.560]  order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of
[1:05:13.560 --> 1:05:21.840]  exterminating 80 percent of humanity is at hand. For the first time in history, the elite's
[1:05:21.840 --> 1:05:26.840]  plan for world government is blown wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the
[1:05:26.840 --> 1:05:31.720]  entire New World Order agenda. Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[1:05:31.720 --> 1:05:34.840]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need.
[1:05:34.840 --> 1:05:40.280]  They're after power. Yes, they're after music. Order in game on DVD at prisonplanet.com or

[1:07:47.760 --> 1:07:57.040]  a free gift. From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the Information
[1:07:57.040 --> 1:08:03.240]  War continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:08:03.240 --> 1:08:13.560]  All right, folks. We are back, and I'm subbing in for Alex for the rest of the week. He has
[1:08:13.560 --> 1:08:20.520]  taken a well-deserved vacation, and we have Mark Dice on the line. Obviously, this entire
[1:08:20.520 --> 1:08:29.260]  situation with Michael Reagan has hit a hot point. It is on RawStory.com right now, making
[1:08:29.260 --> 1:08:32.120]  some pretty big headlines. That's probably the biggest headline it's made so far. People
[1:08:32.120 --> 1:08:38.760]  want to keep it pretty quiet that Reagan's son called for the death, the painful death,
[1:08:38.760 --> 1:08:43.960]  by the way. The executions of 9-11 truthers, especially Mark Dice, who apparently does
[1:08:43.960 --> 1:08:48.280]  not even deserve a blindfold at a firing range. Mark, you're with us.
[1:08:48.280 --> 1:08:52.880]  I'm with you. I just got done doing an interview with that criminal. It was a pre-recorded
[1:08:52.880 --> 1:08:58.480]  show. He's leaving the country here. He introduced the segment by trying to minimize his words
[1:08:58.480 --> 1:09:02.600]  saying that he claimed that if somebody were to shoot me, that he would like to pay for
[1:09:02.600 --> 1:09:07.800]  the bullet, so I had to open by clarifying that he openly put the call out to have his
[1:09:07.800 --> 1:09:12.440]  listeners find and shoot me. Then I read him the penal code in California, which clearly
[1:09:12.440 --> 1:09:18.680]  states that what he did is illegal. He tried to minimize it and then claimed that my people
[1:09:18.680 --> 1:09:24.120]  were then sending him threats and posted his cell phone, his home address on the internet,
[1:09:24.120 --> 1:09:29.320]  which is not true. None of us would make any threats whatsoever. I urged his listeners
[1:09:29.320 --> 1:09:33.840]  to continue the campaign. A lot of people that don't even like me and that don't even
[1:09:33.840 --> 1:09:39.160]  believe what we're doing are appalled and disgusted by this, and it's shocking that
[1:09:39.160 --> 1:09:45.560]  this has hit a brick wall in the mainstream media. Nobody's talking about this. KFI 640,
[1:09:45.560 --> 1:09:50.080]  the largest talk station in Los Angeles, apparently, was addressing the situation.
[1:09:50.080 --> 1:09:54.760]  I was told that they were joking about it and calling me a crackpot, so we just need
[1:09:54.760 --> 1:09:58.880]  to continue to get the word out to other news agencies, continuing to follow reports with
[1:09:58.880 --> 1:10:04.520]  the FCC. I didn't feel like Michael Reagan was remorseful whatsoever, and he needs to
[1:10:04.520 --> 1:10:09.480]  be fired immediately, and I'm going to pursue the legal action to hold him accountable for
[1:10:09.480 --> 1:10:10.480]  his actions.
[1:10:10.480 --> 1:10:15.480]  Let's be clear. Your quote-unquote organization are just people that believe in liberty, the
[1:10:15.480 --> 1:10:20.320]  truth, and pretty much the 9-11 truth movement. You don't have an official organization. Anybody
[1:10:20.320 --> 1:10:24.880]  that's on a message board posting stuff in no way represents you, Mark Dice. However,
[1:10:24.880 --> 1:10:30.720]  this guy has a national audience of millions of listeners, and he himself called for your
[1:10:30.720 --> 1:10:35.880]  execution by gun, and not only yours, but all of 9-11 truthers, because you're trying
[1:10:35.880 --> 1:10:41.360]  to shed some light on the subject to the troops. I just want to get your take on this story.
[1:10:41.360 --> 1:10:48.560]  Now, on Friday, the London Guardian, it reports that Afghan militants attacked Kandahar prisons
[1:10:48.560 --> 1:10:52.840]  in freed inmates. Mark, now it says that out of the 1,000 prisoners that were let go on
[1:10:52.840 --> 1:10:59.000]  this attack, 400 were Taliban militants. Well, of course today, CNN is reporting that hundreds
[1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  of Taliban are now occupying Afghan villages. Again, showing how this entire war on terror,
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:08.840]  especially the one in Afghanistan, is staged. If they were really a threat, they would not
[1:11:08.840 --> 1:11:13.400]  be in a prison in Afghanistan where they could be let go yet again, and wreak havoc on the
[1:11:13.400 --> 1:11:18.080]  people in Afghanistan, giving us another reason to stay there for years and years and years,
[1:11:18.080 --> 1:11:19.080]  and definitely, Mark.
[1:11:19.080 --> 1:11:25.200]  Look, I want to check out the road to Guantanamo. I understand there's a documentary film about
[1:11:25.200 --> 1:11:30.560]  an individual that was in Guantanamo for, I think, months, if not years, and he discusses
[1:11:30.560 --> 1:11:37.000]  the kind of treatment that he was facing there, only to be finally released and had his name
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:41.320]  cleared. And yeah, we know that they've just rounded up individuals and claimed that they
[1:11:41.320 --> 1:11:46.520]  were terrorists, that they were getting paid for anybody that they claimed was a Taliban
[1:11:46.520 --> 1:11:51.080]  member or was a member of Al Qaeda, so that they could be rounded up and put in prison.
[1:11:51.080 --> 1:11:56.000]  And you know, Michael Reagan, he's really just taken this to a new threshold. He's
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:12:03.240]  opened a Pandora's box, and now he made no unequivocal or qualification statements about
[1:12:03.240 --> 1:12:08.120]  it. Usually, somebody will make a qualification after somebody has tried, and then they'll
[1:12:08.120 --> 1:12:14.000]  say, if such and such happens, then they'll make their threat. But he made no qualifications
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:19.560]  that was extremely clear, which California Penal Code 422 states that if it is clear
[1:12:19.560 --> 1:12:25.240]  and unambiguous, then it is a threat punishable by one year in state prison. And that's what
[1:12:25.240 --> 1:12:29.200]  needs to happen to this individual and others. And I'm sure that many of his supporters now
[1:12:29.200 --> 1:12:34.880]  and many out there, upon hearing his statements, will fully support his words and probably try
[1:12:34.880 --> 1:12:40.360]  to carry them out in stalking and in vandalism and in creating bodily harm for myself and
[1:12:40.360 --> 1:12:44.240]  for others. And we need to, I want to thank everybody actually for getting on board for
[1:12:44.240 --> 1:12:48.560]  this and just really standing up for what's right and for not stooping to their level
[1:12:48.560 --> 1:12:53.360]  and not harassing them, not making threats back, but standing up for what's right and
[1:12:53.360 --> 1:12:57.680]  standing up for the Constitution and getting this man off the air is a top priority right
[1:12:57.680 --> 1:13:00.440]  now, followed up by legal and civil action.
[1:13:00.440 --> 1:13:04.160]  Well, I feel like this needs to double and triple our efforts to bring the truth out.
[1:13:04.160 --> 1:13:08.040]  In other words, if you're listening out there and you haven't set a package to a soldier,
[1:13:08.040 --> 1:13:12.480]  it's time to do so. It's time to copy a couple of DVDs, print off some documents, send a
[1:13:12.480 --> 1:13:16.480]  care package with, you know, some candy in there, make it appealing for them and send
[1:13:16.480 --> 1:13:21.760]  it out. And you can go to the resistancemanifesto.com and see how to do that and where to send
[1:13:21.760 --> 1:13:26.840]  it and where to help out. And you also need to put pressure on this guy's radio station
[1:13:26.840 --> 1:13:31.920]  and radio stations and mainstream media across the country that it is not okay to physically
[1:13:31.920 --> 1:13:35.320]  threaten somebody because they hold different beliefs than you. That's what's so great
[1:13:35.320 --> 1:13:41.200]  about this movement, Mark, is that we truly are a peaceful organization in the light of
[1:13:41.200 --> 1:13:46.280]  Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. This is a civil rights issue. This is a civil rights
[1:13:46.280 --> 1:13:50.520]  issue for everybody, Mark. It doesn't matter what the color of your skin is or your choice
[1:13:50.520 --> 1:13:57.040]  of religion. They don't care. You know, it's all about a surf class, about a slave class,
[1:13:57.040 --> 1:14:00.720]  and that's what they're trying to create. They're trying to dehumanize us further and
[1:14:00.720 --> 1:14:05.560]  say, no, it's okay because these guys are bad that we can shoot them, Mark.
[1:14:05.560 --> 1:14:10.520]  Listen, I want to add that anybody that's participating in Operation Inform the Soldiers
[1:14:10.520 --> 1:14:15.840]  where we're sending them emails and DVDs to maybe copy the DVD and don't put the title
[1:14:15.840 --> 1:14:19.920]  on there. People will go through these packages and see if there's any material that they
[1:14:19.920 --> 1:14:24.280]  think is going to be detrimental to the propaganda that they've been feeding the troops that
[1:14:24.280 --> 1:14:28.320]  might not get to them. So just copy the DVD and put a cool film or maybe even put the
[1:14:28.320 --> 1:14:33.960]  title of a different film, a mainstream Hollywood production on the DVD and send it to them
[1:14:33.960 --> 1:14:38.480]  and just write them letters. And if you can't afford to send packages to them, there's also
[1:14:38.480 --> 1:14:43.400]  ways that you can sign up to send emails back and forth to the troops. And I got a couple
[1:14:43.400 --> 1:14:47.360]  of emails from troops that are stationed overseas thanking me for this. One of them
[1:14:47.360 --> 1:14:51.600]  said that a magazine Stars and Stripes, which is delivered to the military, wrote about
[1:14:51.600 --> 1:14:57.960]  our campaign. And several soldiers have written to me asking that we send them specific information
[1:14:57.960 --> 1:15:01.560]  about this and they would distribute it to others. I have a friend of mine that's stationed
[1:15:01.560 --> 1:15:06.520]  overseas that heard about this campaign said that 60% of the people that he's in contact
[1:15:06.520 --> 1:15:11.440]  with are on our side. The only people that don't are morons that just play video games
[1:15:11.440 --> 1:15:16.440]  all day long. And he said that it's a great idea to foster a discussion, to encourage
[1:15:16.440 --> 1:15:20.400]  a debate and to get this information out to create a safe climate. So again, you don't
[1:15:20.400 --> 1:15:24.680]  want to spend the money to send them information. You can sign up to send them emails back and
[1:15:24.680 --> 1:15:30.640]  forth and send them links to tear storm, to loose change, final cut. And let's befriend
[1:15:30.640 --> 1:15:35.280]  these troops and let's show them the kind of compassion that Gandhi and Martin Luther
[1:15:35.280 --> 1:15:37.560]  King showed his fellow man.
[1:15:37.560 --> 1:15:41.640]  Absolutely. Again, you can catch more flies with honey and that's the kind of approach
[1:15:41.640 --> 1:15:49.120]  I'm all about. I was in a bar over the weekend and I had a little infowars.com bracelet on.
[1:15:49.120 --> 1:15:53.640]  You can get those over at infowars.com by the way. This kid's next to me and he's like,
[1:15:53.640 --> 1:15:58.080]  so what are you, ex-military? And I'm like, no, I'm like, why? What does it look like?
[1:15:58.080 --> 1:16:03.200]  I'm ex-military. He's like, no, I saw the infowars.com on there and wars.com. I thought
[1:16:03.200 --> 1:16:08.160]  maybe that, you know, you had some political affiliation. And I said, no, you know, this
[1:16:08.160 --> 1:16:13.000]  is a website. I asked him if he knew who Alex Jones was. He didn't. He was ex-military
[1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:17.920]  himself. He had been in the army. He luckily had not had to go overseas to Iraq. He'd
[1:16:17.920 --> 1:16:21.760]  been stationed in Japan for a while. And he's like, well, what's it all about? So, you
[1:16:21.760 --> 1:16:26.400]  know, I had building seven on my phone. I showed him building seven right away. I peek
[1:16:26.400 --> 1:16:30.280]  his interest. He's like, okay, so what's going on with that building? I explained to him
[1:16:30.280 --> 1:16:34.240]  that, you know, it housed the largest CIA field office outside of Langley. It had the
[1:16:34.240 --> 1:16:38.520]  largest secret service field office in the world, Office of Emergency Management, Department
[1:16:38.520 --> 1:16:42.160]  of Defense, Securities and Exchange Commission. And you just saw his face kind of go pale white
[1:16:42.160 --> 1:16:47.560]  as I'm telling him this. And, you know, we talked for a little bit longer, but eventually,
[1:16:47.560 --> 1:16:52.120]  unfortunately, you know, he just said, you know, well, there's not a lot I can do about
[1:16:52.120 --> 1:16:57.440]  it. You know, it's probably true. But again, I'm just one person. And I just said to him
[1:16:57.440 --> 1:17:01.400]  and his buddy, you know, that's the wrong kind of attitude, man. We all have great power.
[1:17:01.400 --> 1:17:05.320]  And I just told you to do something. You can tell two other people. You can tell 200 other
[1:17:05.320 --> 1:17:09.800]  people. We can have an effect mark. We can make a difference. And I think that you're
[1:17:09.800 --> 1:17:14.920]  the epitome of that. I mean, by putting videos out on YouTube, by staying media savvy, putting
[1:17:14.920 --> 1:17:21.800]  out press releases, and really making a difference by sending troops up DVDs by people. Go ahead.
[1:17:21.800 --> 1:17:25.560]  If people would have told Martin Luther King that the powers that be are too powerful, that
[1:17:25.560 --> 1:17:30.200]  the white man's in control, that nothing's going to change. That would have just spoiled
[1:17:30.200 --> 1:17:33.160]  the movement. And who knows what would have happened. People need to get together. We
[1:17:33.160 --> 1:17:37.520]  can make change. It's been done in the past. You know, my dad says the squeaky wheel gets
[1:17:37.520 --> 1:17:43.360]  the grease. And by squeaking as loud as we can, we will make a change. We have made
[1:17:43.360 --> 1:17:47.280]  a change. We've thrown a wrench in the New World Order. I think that the movement has
[1:17:47.280 --> 1:17:53.000]  prevented another false flag attack from happening. We know that they would have done it by now
[1:17:53.000 --> 1:17:56.880]  if the large amount of the population wouldn't have been informed. If anything happens now,
[1:17:56.880 --> 1:18:01.480]  we're going to stand up and point the finger at directly who did it. So we can make change.
[1:18:01.480 --> 1:18:05.480]  And in my interview with Michael Reagan, there was a lot of cross talk. I couldn't even finish
[1:18:05.480 --> 1:18:09.560]  a sentence without him budding in. So I don't know how much of the information I said got
[1:18:09.560 --> 1:18:15.560]  out, but this man needs to be held accountable and anybody else that suggests such ridiculous
[1:18:15.560 --> 1:18:20.920]  things, such criminal activities. And so please get on board, contact Radio America,
[1:18:20.920 --> 1:18:26.280]  let's send the troops some information, send them documents, send them, write them a letter.
[1:18:26.280 --> 1:18:28.920]  You know, you don't even have to send them Operation Northwoods. If you start sending
[1:18:28.920 --> 1:18:33.120]  them documents, somebody might fish through the package and think that it's material that
[1:18:33.120 --> 1:18:37.160]  the troops shouldn't see. So if we just write them emails and tell them, hey, we understand
[1:18:37.160 --> 1:18:41.240]  that you're there. We want you guys to come home. We support you, but we don't support
[1:18:41.240 --> 1:18:44.920]  the criminals that sent you there. And let's just, in the letter, let's create a dialogue
[1:18:44.920 --> 1:18:48.320]  with them. And you know, a lot of the troops already know, but we want to just support
[1:18:48.320 --> 1:18:51.720]  them and we want to create a climate so that they can start bringing these issues up over
[1:18:51.720 --> 1:18:57.960]  there so that they're not just following orders, despite how ineffective and how criminal
[1:18:57.960 --> 1:18:59.520]  the orders may be.
[1:18:59.520 --> 1:19:03.520]  Absolutely. And the truth of the matter is they're going to come home at some point.
[1:19:03.520 --> 1:19:07.120]  And a lot of them are going to be involved in security services, sometimes private security
[1:19:07.120 --> 1:19:11.960]  forces, sometimes our very own police. And you're going to want these people to be educated
[1:19:11.960 --> 1:19:16.920]  in both the Constitution and the Bill of Rights and the current geopolitical situation in
[1:19:16.920 --> 1:19:21.280]  case there is an attack in this country, in case they do release bio weapons, in case
[1:19:21.280 --> 1:19:25.680]  they do decide to round people up. You know, I'd rather have somebody who knows what's
[1:19:25.680 --> 1:19:30.480]  going on, who's compassionate to human life, who hasn't fallen for all the dehumanizing
[1:19:30.480 --> 1:19:34.600]  brainwashing out there than somebody who's just a pawn of the system. It's the Alex
[1:19:34.600 --> 1:19:51.600]  Jones show. I'm with Mark Dice. We'll be back after this.

[1:20:50.960 --> 1:20:55.120]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt,
[1:20:55.120 --> 1:21:00.160]  but the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching
[1:21:00.160 --> 1:21:07.760]  a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years.
[1:21:07.760 --> 1:21:12.300]  The U.S. economy receives its currency by taking on debt through private banking institution
[1:21:12.300 --> 1:21:17.040]  called the Federal Reserve System. In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[1:21:17.040 --> 1:21:22.600]  It's bad enough that the U.S. citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce, however
[1:21:22.600 --> 1:21:27.000]  shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth
[1:21:27.000 --> 1:21:28.760]  in a stock portfolio.

[1:21:56.240 --> 1:22:01.160]  been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers. The number of the mounted
[1:22:01.160 --> 1:22:06.160]  troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the U.S. Though the people
[1:22:06.160 --> 1:22:10.520]  of the U.S. where their numbers and influence are strongest have primary responsibility
[1:22:10.520 --> 1:22:14.760]  for reigning the men and bringing them to justice, all nations will participate since
[1:22:14.760 --> 1:22:20.320]  they reside the world over. They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the New World
[1:22:20.320 --> 1:22:25.720]  Order. They oppose everything that is God and truth. They are of the line that was disinherited
[1:22:25.720 --> 1:22:31.040]  2,000 years ago. Everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated,
[1:22:31.040 --> 1:22:35.160]  the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses, the destruction of the earth
[1:22:35.160 --> 1:22:40.760]  and mankind, we will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us. Visit our

[1:24:05.440 --> 1:24:22.960]  All right, folks. We're back at the Alex Jones show. I'm sitting in. I'm Jason Bermas with
[1:24:22.960 --> 1:24:28.800]  me, Mark Dice. Let's read the raw story article real quick. Radio talk show host calls for
[1:24:28.800 --> 1:24:34.920]  murder of anti-war activist. Michael Reagan radio talk show host and son of late president
[1:24:34.920 --> 1:24:39.720]  Ronald Reagan adopted son. Could be investigated by the FBI after he called for the execution
[1:24:39.720 --> 1:24:43.960]  of Mark Dice. I'm glad they're not messy words. That's what he did. Anti-war activist and
[1:24:43.960 --> 1:24:50.720]  founder of the media watchdog group, The Resistance on Air. On June 10th edition of his nationally
[1:24:50.720 --> 1:24:55.000]  syndicated Radio America show, Reagan called Dice and others in the 9-11 truth movement
[1:24:55.000 --> 1:25:00.120]  Traders, after learning that they were sending letters, declassified documents and DVDs to
[1:25:00.120 --> 1:25:04.680]  troops in Iraq that they say point to government involvement in the attacks on the World Trade
[1:25:04.680 --> 1:25:09.120]  Center in 2001. The effort is part of The Resistance. Operation Inform the Soldiers
[1:25:09.120 --> 1:25:13.440]  would a great title. I don't want the soldiers who are risking their lives in Iraq to be
[1:25:13.440 --> 1:25:18.440]  used as pawns in the creation of the New World Order, Dice said in a recent press release.
[1:25:18.440 --> 1:25:22.160]  I personally know U.S. Marines who believe 9-11 was an inside job and they tell me that
[1:25:22.160 --> 1:25:27.200]  many Marines suspect that this is the case but are afraid to speak up out of fear of
[1:25:27.200 --> 1:25:31.120]  punishment. And that's the truth. I mean, you go along to get along. You're in a high
[1:25:31.120 --> 1:25:35.080]  stress situation. You really don't want to stand out there, do you, Mark?
[1:25:35.080 --> 1:25:39.720]  Absolutely not. I want to say something else too. Some people are emailing me. There's
[1:25:39.720 --> 1:25:44.640]  been a couple blogs that have suggested that I not go on Michael Reagan's show thinking
[1:25:44.640 --> 1:25:48.680]  that it's going to hurt the case. The case officer with the FBI said that this would
[1:25:48.680 --> 1:25:53.480]  not hurt the case whatsoever. I know what I'm doing. I'm in contact with them. Another
[1:25:53.480 --> 1:25:59.040]  instance, something else I was going to do, they suggested would hurt the case. So I refrained
[1:25:59.040 --> 1:26:03.320]  from doing it. They knew full and well that I was going to go on the show, that I was
[1:26:03.320 --> 1:26:06.520]  invited on the show and they said that that would be fine. This doesn't hurt the case
[1:26:06.520 --> 1:26:12.400]  whatsoever. Some people thought that I would go on and accept his apology. When you accept
[1:26:12.400 --> 1:26:18.480]  an apology and when you forgive someone, you then remove any rights to hold them accountable.
[1:26:18.480 --> 1:26:23.920]  And so he does not deserve to be forgiven at this moment. He must pay for what he has
[1:26:23.920 --> 1:26:30.160]  done. I said that I hope that this was the last broadcast of his career and I enjoyed
[1:26:30.160 --> 1:26:35.560]  being on what I hope to be the last broadcast of his radio career. So anybody that thinks
[1:26:35.560 --> 1:26:40.000]  that this was going to hurt the case is just point wrong. So I just want to thank everybody
[1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:45.560]  for their concern and for the outreach. This just goes to show, man, when they attack one
[1:26:45.560 --> 1:26:47.560]  of us, they attack us all.
[1:26:47.560 --> 1:26:51.880]  Absolutely. And I got a lot of those emails myself, Mark. They're like, oh, you know,
[1:26:51.880 --> 1:26:55.080]  Mark, you need to tell them not to go on that show. And I'm like, look, you know, the guy
[1:26:55.080 --> 1:26:59.880]  is going to do what he's going to do. It's his decision. He was the one threatened. And
[1:26:59.880 --> 1:27:04.200]  you know, you've been smart in the past, Mark. So I'm not going to judge what you're
[1:27:04.200 --> 1:27:08.240]  doing. I think it's a smart idea to go on there, especially to see, you know, him try
[1:27:08.240 --> 1:27:12.560]  to weasel out of it. And now that I know that it was a pre-recorded interview, I mean, God
[1:27:12.560 --> 1:27:17.560]  knows how they're going to edit it. You know, just listening to the last time they were
[1:27:17.560 --> 1:27:23.200]  discussing you, of course, they tried to lump in Ron Paul, which is absolutely ridiculousness.
[1:27:23.200 --> 1:27:27.440]  And they actually made jokes. Oh, that's where all the Ron Paul supporters went, Mark.
[1:27:27.440 --> 1:27:33.680]  Yeah. Now I videotape myself during the entire conversation. So if what is aired does not
[1:27:33.680 --> 1:27:38.840]  match up with what was actually said or was edited in any way, I will be releasing that
[1:27:38.840 --> 1:27:42.080]  video. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I can't even get out of the office
[1:27:42.080 --> 1:27:44.760]  here, Mark. You're saying you did an interview with who?
[1:27:44.760 --> 1:27:51.360]  No, I was on Reagan's show. So those pre-recorded. So those cowards pre-recorded it.
[1:27:51.360 --> 1:27:56.000]  They pre-recorded the entire show. Apparently he's going to be leaving the country. I made
[1:27:56.000 --> 1:27:59.320]  it clear to the listeners. He made it seem like it was live. It's a beautiful sunny day
[1:27:59.320 --> 1:28:02.400]  in Southern California. So I let everybody know there was 8.30 in the morning when I
[1:28:02.400 --> 1:28:06.880]  did that. And then just to make sure that what was recorded, what makes it out on air
[1:28:06.880 --> 1:28:11.600]  was what was actually said. Again, I videotaped myself during the entire conversation.
[1:28:11.600 --> 1:28:14.800]  Well, let me just throw something in here and then I'm going to get out of here and let
[1:28:14.800 --> 1:28:17.400]  Burma's do the show. But I was walking by out in the other office listening to it and
[1:28:17.400 --> 1:28:21.440]  I had to comment about something I heard a few minutes ago. The fact that this is one
[1:28:21.440 --> 1:28:23.920]  point I haven't made. I want your take on this and I'm going to get out of here. And
[1:28:23.920 --> 1:28:28.000]  I know you got to go too. I appreciate you doing the show, Burma's. It's that by them
[1:28:28.000 --> 1:28:30.800]  attacking you and making a big deal out of this, it's only going to make everybody now
[1:28:30.800 --> 1:28:34.440]  send this stuff to the troops. I mean, they're just idiots. It's going to completely, these
[1:28:34.440 --> 1:28:38.600]  bullies don't understand that the American people aren't going to back down. So now
[1:28:38.600 --> 1:28:43.160]  that they've done all this on Fox and Reagan show, I bet 50 times the amount of terror
[1:28:43.160 --> 1:28:46.880]  storm and loose change final cut DVDs are going to be sent out.
[1:28:46.880 --> 1:28:52.040]  Yeah, they're playing this completely backfired. And while it's a very stressful situation
[1:28:52.040 --> 1:28:57.120]  to be in, I think that it's going to be beneficial for operation and for the soldiers. It's
[1:28:57.120 --> 1:29:00.960]  going to be beneficial for the 9 11 truth movement. It's going to be beneficial for
[1:29:00.960 --> 1:29:04.840]  the country and for us all. So, you know, I'm not taking a few days off. Get out of
[1:29:04.840 --> 1:29:10.240]  here, Burma's. I'm doing the show. All right. Hey, Dice, great job. I'll be tuned in tomorrow
[1:29:10.240 --> 1:29:14.960]  to see what happens after the interview later today. And I'm sure they're going to edit
[1:29:14.960 --> 1:29:18.520]  it. She'll have to release it and that'll be a whole nother issue. Is he leaving now
[1:29:18.520 --> 1:29:19.520]  or is this it?
[1:29:19.520 --> 1:29:22.360]  I think that we only had until 30 after.
[1:29:22.360 --> 1:29:23.360]  Do you have to go, Dice?
[1:29:23.360 --> 1:29:25.920]  I could probably spend another seven minutes with you guys if you want.
[1:29:25.920 --> 1:29:29.320]  Yeah, stay stay under 10 minutes with Lord Burma's. All right, folks, have a good one.
[1:29:29.320 --> 1:29:51.480]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

[1:30:00.640 --> 1:30:06.280]  in America is more than $200 billion annually with a worst toll taken by antibiotics. But
[1:30:06.280 --> 1:30:10.640]  there is a cure for this medical madness that has remained secret. Oxysilver, developed
[1:30:10.640 --> 1:30:15.880]  by NASA scientists to keep astronauts healthy, is an evolutionary new dietary supplement making
[1:30:15.880 --> 1:30:21.280]  deadly vaccinations and antibiotics obsolete. Taking one to two teaspoons daily boosts natural
[1:30:21.280 --> 1:30:27.240]  immunity without drug toxicity. Oxysilver combines oxygen and silver in a new way. The oxygen
[1:30:27.240 --> 1:30:32.360]  becomes a supercharged germ killer freeing your immune system to fight colds, flus, cancers
[1:30:32.360 --> 1:30:38.240]  and more. Build disease defenses naturally, painlessly, powerfully, safely and inexpensively
[1:30:38.240 --> 1:30:49.520]  with oxysilver. Order your supply now by calling toll free 1-877-817-9829. That's 1-877-817-9829.

[1:30:51.440 --> 1:30:55.880]  Now from the makers of Loose Change. The most downloaded film in internet history comes
[1:30:55.880 --> 1:31:02.120]  the long awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two hour film that completely
[1:31:02.120 --> 1:31:06.840]  destroys the official fable forever. Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for
[1:31:06.840 --> 1:31:11.560]  a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions
[1:31:11.560 --> 1:31:16.080]  and the true perpetrators of the horrendous crime are brought to justice. Loose Change
[1:31:16.080 --> 1:31:21.560]  Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose. From hijackers being trained at US military bases
[1:31:21.560 --> 1:31:27.280]  to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[1:31:51.560 --> 1:31:55.680]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that
[1:31:55.680 --> 1:31:59.680]  you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking
[1:31:59.680 --> 1:32:03.720]  the water? That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others
[1:32:03.720 --> 1:32:08.840]  are absorbed into the skin. The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold
[1:32:08.840 --> 1:32:13.800]  water and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron, and it inhibits the
[1:32:13.800 --> 1:32:19.440]  growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus. The KDF dual media shower filter typically
[1:32:19.440 --> 1:32:24.400]  lasts 10,000 gallons or one year whichever comes first. Hospitals, restaurants and water
[1:32:24.400 --> 1:32:29.120]  treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[1:32:29.120 --> 1:32:35.480]  What about you? Order your KDF shower filter normally $49 for a special price of only $39.99

[1:33:12.160 --> 1:33:32.760]  Back before Elks and before Vietnam War came along. Before the Beatles and yesterday when
[1:33:32.760 --> 1:33:45.920]  a man could still work, still would. It's the best of the free life behind us now. And
[1:33:45.920 --> 1:33:54.560]  our good times really over for good. Alright folks, we're back. It's the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:54.560 --> 1:34:01.360]  I'm Jason Burmes. And Mark, I gotta tell you, they seem to be throwing a big fit over the
[1:34:01.360 --> 1:34:07.320]  fact that the Supreme Court has finally decided that habeas corpus does still exist. We do
[1:34:07.320 --> 1:34:11.840]  have the right to face our accusers. And let me just read a couple of things that have
[1:34:11.840 --> 1:34:16.880]  been said by a couple of the top neocons. First of all, Gengrich has said, the court
[1:34:16.880 --> 1:34:22.320]  decision is a disaster, which could cost us a city. And the debate ought to be whether
[1:34:22.320 --> 1:34:27.780]  you're prepared to lose an American city on behalf of five lawyers. It was a five to
[1:34:27.780 --> 1:34:32.760]  four decision. It's pretty ridiculous. Of course, they're saying, oh, because we have
[1:34:32.760 --> 1:34:37.160]  habeas corpus, that means the city needs to blow up. That's really great. And then McCain
[1:34:37.160 --> 1:34:41.440]  is also attacking the ruling. This is the guy who is running for the president who'll
[1:34:41.440 --> 1:34:47.080]  probably get, you know, 30, 40, maybe 50 or 60% of the vote of the sheeple out there,
[1:34:47.080 --> 1:34:50.840]  unfortunately. And it's he saying it's one of the worst decisions in the history of
[1:34:50.840 --> 1:34:57.760]  the country. After all, he wants to bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb Iran. So we have these neocons
[1:34:57.760 --> 1:35:01.920]  basically saying that habeas corpus is bad. We don't need it. And if we do have it, Mark,
[1:35:01.920 --> 1:35:04.640]  a US city is going to blow up. Sounds about right.
[1:35:04.640 --> 1:35:11.720]  These Nazis have no respect for human life whatsoever. They're, they're continuous erosion
[1:35:11.720 --> 1:35:16.640]  of, of the freedoms of humanity of the citizens of these United States and of other countries
[1:35:16.640 --> 1:35:22.200]  around the world. It's just absolutely despicable. There's video clips on YouTube of Michael
[1:35:22.200 --> 1:35:27.360]  Reagan saying things I don't even want to say. You can just look it up yourself. It's
[1:35:27.360 --> 1:35:32.200]  the title, his solution for the Middle East. He wants to do very bad things. The children
[1:35:32.200 --> 1:35:37.320]  over there, young babies, he wants everybody to be killed. He's called for Howard Dean
[1:35:37.320 --> 1:35:42.240]  to be hung. This man has a track record of, of issuing violent statements. And I was able
[1:35:42.240 --> 1:35:46.320]  to mention one issue about the Bilderberg group. And apparently Michael Reagan thinks
[1:35:46.320 --> 1:35:50.280]  that that was quote, old news and, and doesn't matter anymore.
[1:35:50.280 --> 1:35:56.120]  Oh, the, the Bilderberg group that met a week ago is old news. Although much of the policy
[1:35:56.120 --> 1:36:01.360]  that they discussed has not yet been implemented, but it's old news. I mean, it's unbelievable.
[1:36:01.360 --> 1:36:04.880]  Actually, you know, I'm going to try to play the clip, but earlier this week, the student
[1:36:04.880 --> 1:36:10.360]  scholars asked John Edwards yet again about his participation, participation in Bilderberg
[1:36:10.360 --> 1:36:14.360]  and really had him at a moment where he had to answer. And he answered, he said that he
[1:36:14.360 --> 1:36:20.040]  gave a 20 to 30 minute speech. And then he was asked, well, was, was this where you were,
[1:36:20.040 --> 1:36:23.840]  you know, picked to be the running mate of John Kerry? Did you discuss being, you know,
[1:36:23.840 --> 1:36:28.520]  the vice presidential candidate? And he's like, Oh, no, no, that was before I was, I
[1:36:28.520 --> 1:36:32.440]  was picked. So he just kind of walks away and smiles, but he knows that the decision
[1:36:32.440 --> 1:36:38.000]  to make him the vice presidential candidate was made at Bilderberg. We all know that Obama
[1:36:38.000 --> 1:36:43.640]  and Hillary met with Bilderberg members. I mean, it's not an accident that he literally
[1:36:43.640 --> 1:36:48.200]  tricked his press corps into getting on a plane so that he could be right around the
[1:36:48.200 --> 1:36:53.840]  corner in Virginia to have quote unquote secret meetings that ended up being with Hillary
[1:36:53.840 --> 1:36:58.200]  Clinton and others. And the stories of where they met have changed from, you know, they
[1:36:58.200 --> 1:37:03.280]  met at her private home, they met at somebody else's house, they met at Diane Feinstein's.
[1:37:03.280 --> 1:37:07.920]  Well the truth of the matter is they probably met at the Marriott in Chantilly, Virginia
[1:37:07.920 --> 1:37:13.280]  with a bunch of high level globalists, Mark. Even if they weren't able to make it to the
[1:37:13.280 --> 1:37:17.760]  hotel itself, I'm sure that they were on a conference call or that members of the Bilderberg
[1:37:17.760 --> 1:37:21.960]  group came to them. And yeah, this is despicable. That's why they're trying to put an end to
[1:37:21.960 --> 1:37:27.080]  the internet, whether trying to charge us for our bandwidth, for internet usage, for
[1:37:27.080 --> 1:37:32.080]  the emails that are sent. And we're just not going to stop. They're in panic mode right
[1:37:32.080 --> 1:37:36.440]  now. I don't think they know what to do. I think they underestimated the good people
[1:37:36.440 --> 1:37:41.960]  of this country. They underestimated the dedication of individuals to care for this country and
[1:37:41.960 --> 1:37:46.480]  to get the word out. And they're in damage control. They're going to have to revamp their
[1:37:46.480 --> 1:37:51.200]  entire plan. And let's just continue to throw wrenches into their system in a peacefully
[1:37:51.200 --> 1:37:56.440]  and civilly way, civil way. And we'll just continue to fight for this country and do
[1:37:56.440 --> 1:37:59.680]  everything that we can to stand up for what's right.
[1:37:59.680 --> 1:38:04.320]  Absolutely. You know, I want to get your take on this, this article too. The Times Online
[1:38:04.320 --> 1:38:10.760]  is, The Times of London that is, is now reporting that Bush is going to do one last push to
[1:38:10.760 --> 1:38:15.640]  get bin Laden before he leaves office. And of course, yeah. And of course, Intel officers
[1:38:15.640 --> 1:38:20.520]  are saying, well, if he gets bin Laden, there'll be no doubt in history that he really saved
[1:38:20.520 --> 1:38:25.600]  us from the terrorist. After all, he killed Saddam Hussein. And if he gets that bin Laden,
[1:38:25.600 --> 1:38:30.520]  boy, this, this Bush presidency is going to go down in history as a great one. And I'm
[1:38:30.520 --> 1:38:35.680]  thinking to myself, oh my God, say they do roll out this boogeyman. All they'll do is
[1:38:35.680 --> 1:38:40.680]  create another boogeyman. They'll create an Iranian boogeyman or some other Middle Eastern
[1:38:40.680 --> 1:38:46.560]  type that's shadowy. And then Bush will be worshiped for six months to a year on television.
[1:38:46.560 --> 1:38:51.600]  We'll see specials about it the rest of our lives, Mark. I mean, it really turns my stomach
[1:38:51.600 --> 1:38:57.800]  that somebody who is a front man for this international crime syndicate, the actual people
[1:38:57.800 --> 1:39:04.080]  that carried out 9-11 is still going to try to pose as our hero by wheeling out, you know,
[1:39:04.080 --> 1:39:06.160]  this Patsy, this intelligence asset.
[1:39:06.160 --> 1:39:09.480]  Look, probably what they're going to do is they're going to blow up a cave or blow up
[1:39:09.480 --> 1:39:12.800]  some building somewhere and then just claim that he was there, claim that they have the
[1:39:12.800 --> 1:39:18.200]  DNA evidence that it was him that intelligence leads to them to believe that conclusively
[1:39:18.200 --> 1:39:22.800]  that it was him. And it's possible that he's been dead. It's likely he's been dead for
[1:39:22.800 --> 1:39:23.800]  quite some time.
[1:39:23.800 --> 1:39:27.400]  And we just need to get the word out again about the professors over at Duke University,
[1:39:27.400 --> 1:39:31.920]  the voice analysts that show that some of the tapes that have been released claiming
[1:39:31.920 --> 1:39:37.960]  to be bin Laden by the CIA and by the White House are in fact not him. Some of the videos
[1:39:37.960 --> 1:39:44.080]  that have been released claiming to be new videos are in fact old videos, excerpts of
[1:39:44.080 --> 1:39:48.800]  old videos that have already been released. So I'm just going to guess that if they do
[1:39:48.800 --> 1:39:52.400]  pull this, that they will blow up a cave or a building and claim that he was there and
[1:39:52.400 --> 1:39:57.280]  that they have got him. And yeah, Bush is the new savior. The war on terror is successful
[1:39:57.280 --> 1:40:01.240]  and now we need to shift it to a new phase, which is just ridiculous. We just need to
[1:40:01.240 --> 1:40:04.440]  continue to expose them for all that they are.
[1:40:04.440 --> 1:40:11.440]  Absolutely. And you know, I see the mainstream really leaning towards Obama. I mean, I don't
[1:40:11.440 --> 1:40:16.080]  see much of a push from McCain. I feel like he was the establishment candidate that wouldn't
[1:40:16.080 --> 1:40:20.800]  challenge any of their ideas that would tow the line of these globalists, no matter what.
[1:40:20.800 --> 1:40:27.280]  But I really can't see him being elected. Eight years of neocon tyranny has really taken
[1:40:27.280 --> 1:40:32.400]  its toll even in the minds of the sheeple. And you know, Barack Obama is a very well
[1:40:32.400 --> 1:40:37.280]  spoken guy. He doesn't say much, but people want change. They can vote for Mark. And it's
[1:40:37.280 --> 1:40:42.340]  these slogans that are embedded in people's minds. And I think they actually trick themselves
[1:40:42.340 --> 1:40:46.560]  into believing that if they vote for somebody like Obama, who will probably have Hillary
[1:40:46.560 --> 1:40:51.240]  as his running mate, maybe Edwards, who knows, they're going to get change and they're not
[1:40:51.240 --> 1:40:54.320]  going to get changed. They're going to have the same globalist overlords. They're going
[1:40:54.320 --> 1:40:58.880]  to have the same lack of freedoms. They're going to have the same push towards this
[1:40:58.880 --> 1:41:03.920]  technocracy, this biometric society. In fact, I've got a story right in front of me right
[1:41:03.920 --> 1:41:08.800]  now from Philly.com where it's telling me that there's going to be new wine vending
[1:41:08.800 --> 1:41:13.080]  machines in the next five years and that they are going to biometrically decide whether
[1:41:13.080 --> 1:41:15.640]  you're old enough to make the purchase mark.
[1:41:15.640 --> 1:41:20.840]  Yeah, we know that the Bilderberg group and the criminals that run the voting machines
[1:41:20.840 --> 1:41:26.160]  can sway the votes in large percentages. And it just depends on who's willing to serve
[1:41:26.160 --> 1:41:31.000]  them the most. That's who the money's going to go behind. I mean, we know that the money
[1:41:31.000 --> 1:41:35.560]  is behind both of them. And I think that perhaps once they decide, once this establishment
[1:41:35.560 --> 1:41:40.640]  decides who it is that's going to bow down and willingly serve them the best and be able
[1:41:40.640 --> 1:41:45.600]  to rally up the most public support for their agenda will be the one that they finally push
[1:41:45.600 --> 1:41:50.480]  slightly ahead of the race and give the presidency to. Yeah, we know that years ago, I think
[1:41:50.480 --> 1:41:56.880]  it was in 2001 at the Super Bowl here in San Diego that there was spatial recognition cameras
[1:41:56.880 --> 1:42:02.840]  scanning the crowds, testing the system, and their system is just now finally being implemented
[1:42:02.840 --> 1:42:08.880]  around the world. And once this system goes global, we won't be able to walk outside of
[1:42:08.880 --> 1:42:13.960]  our house without being scanned, without being recognized, and with the push of a button,
[1:42:13.960 --> 1:42:18.640]  they'll be able to track and trace our every move through voice morphing and through voice
[1:42:18.640 --> 1:42:23.480]  tracking technology. You could probably pick up any phone. You could pick up a pay phone
[1:42:23.480 --> 1:42:28.680]  in Mexico and your voice print is going to be detected by echelon and that call is going
[1:42:28.680 --> 1:42:33.440]  to be logged and flagged and traced as to who it is that you're calling. So yeah, this
[1:42:33.440 --> 1:42:37.080]  system is being implemented. And again, we have nothing to hide, which is why we just
[1:42:37.080 --> 1:42:42.200]  need to expose the people that do have things to hide. Absolutely. And you mentioned echelon,
[1:42:42.200 --> 1:42:45.920]  but these are programs that have been around for quite some time, programs that predate
[1:42:45.920 --> 1:42:52.760]  911. I encourage people to check out the carnivore software they have, the promise software
[1:42:52.760 --> 1:42:58.960]  they have. And of course, echelon. This is an all encompassing piece of software that
[1:42:58.960 --> 1:43:04.320]  really gets data information and crunches it very quickly. And I mean, anything from
[1:43:04.320 --> 1:43:11.280]  your phone conversations to your emails to your online time spent, I mean, it's there
[1:43:11.280 --> 1:43:15.560]  and the government's had it for a long time. And it's not talked about mark. And if they
[1:43:15.560 --> 1:43:20.280]  do get to implement this, this system, this system of a cashless society control grid,
[1:43:20.280 --> 1:43:24.200]  which they're weaning us towards, you know, it's incrementalization. But you know, 20
[1:43:24.200 --> 1:43:28.640]  years down the line, when most of the populations chipped anyway, because they think it's cool
[1:43:28.640 --> 1:43:33.200]  mark, because it goes with their latest video game system, it gets them access to their
[1:43:33.200 --> 1:43:38.640]  their next club, it gets them 10% off at Walmart, you know, and then the government comes in
[1:43:38.640 --> 1:43:42.640]  and says, well, most of us have it anyway, it's really, it's really for our own benefit
[1:43:42.640 --> 1:43:46.880]  and safety. And if you take this chip, you know, you're going to get free medical coverage,
[1:43:46.880 --> 1:43:49.920]  you know, they're going to, they're going to pave it, you know, the road to hell is
[1:43:49.920 --> 1:43:54.400]  paved with great intentions. And they're going to make it look like a gold paved road. And
[1:43:54.400 --> 1:43:59.720]  it literally will be a gold paved road to hell mark, you know, a hellish system where you're
[1:43:59.720 --> 1:44:03.920]  told what you can and cannot consume, how much of which, you know, how long you have
[1:44:03.920 --> 1:44:09.080]  to work. I mean, I just can't picture what society is going to be like if you look how
[1:44:09.080 --> 1:44:14.160]  much society has changed just in the past 20 to 30 years. It's amazing. I mean, we literally
[1:44:14.160 --> 1:44:18.960]  went from a society that played board games as a family to where families don't even have
[1:44:18.960 --> 1:44:25.160]  dinner anymore. The kids are spoiled raw and they're on their ps3, you know, they're they're
[1:44:25.160 --> 1:44:30.120]  rap bastards a lot of times, Mark, and they're not informed at all. People don't read anymore.
[1:44:30.120 --> 1:44:34.600]  The television that they watch is garbage. I mean, I remember as a kid watching entertainment
[1:44:34.600 --> 1:44:39.360]  tonight, and that was the big tabloid program, but it was only on for, you know, an hour a
[1:44:39.360 --> 1:44:44.800]  day. Now there's entire networks dedicated to that kind of tabloid journalism. And even
[1:44:44.800 --> 1:44:50.080]  the quote unquote real news networks like Fox News, MSNBC are as tabloid as they get
[1:44:50.080 --> 1:44:55.640]  this at this point, Mark. Look, Perisilpin and some others will probably get the chip.
[1:44:55.640 --> 1:45:01.440]  They'll be touted as being the new, new purveyors of this trend. And when Fox News and all really
[1:45:01.440 --> 1:45:06.480]  all the networks has live coverage of Perisilpin going to jail, I mean, that's, that just goes
[1:45:06.480 --> 1:45:11.040]  to show this is not news. They don't care about the news. And for these people that are saying
[1:45:11.040 --> 1:45:16.360]  that this chip and the very chip and then the future digital angel with GPS is going
[1:45:16.360 --> 1:45:21.760]  to be a way that can protect their kids, they're not thinking about the fact that if some psycho,
[1:45:21.760 --> 1:45:25.760]  some, some sick pedophile wants to kidnap the kid, he's just going to cut the chip out
[1:45:25.760 --> 1:45:29.560]  of them and smash it. So they'll, they'll know the area where the kid was taken from,
[1:45:29.560 --> 1:45:32.080]  but they're not going to know where the kid is going. I mean, these people are going
[1:45:32.080 --> 1:45:36.960]  to be able to destroy these chips and cut them out. And not only that, but you're going
[1:45:36.960 --> 1:45:40.920]  to have hackers that are going to hack the chips and, and that are going to copy chips
[1:45:40.920 --> 1:45:46.600]  and be able to take your identity or others and then be able to access places or perhaps
[1:45:46.600 --> 1:45:52.880]  make charges, you know, credit card charges, purchases in, in your name. So this is not
[1:45:52.880 --> 1:45:58.720]  a security device. This really is an Orwellian device. So let's keep in mind that they first
[1:45:58.720 --> 1:46:04.400]  started putting these in dogs and in animals as tracking that on myself, on myself, I'm
[1:46:04.400 --> 1:46:08.760]  not a, not an animal. And we know that they were, they were putting numbers on the, the
[1:46:08.760 --> 1:46:13.400]  Jews in the concentration camps and so on myself, I'm not going to be, uh, be marked
[1:46:13.400 --> 1:46:18.520]  for death here with this, this very chip or any other similar system that they may, uh,
[1:46:18.520 --> 1:46:19.520]  invoke.
[1:46:19.520 --> 1:46:22.720]  I'm glad you wrote up the pedophile concern because again, I have a story right in front
[1:46:22.720 --> 1:46:29.040]  of me right now from australianit.news.com set of Australia. They have a new intranet
[1:46:29.040 --> 1:46:34.280]  database that they've put together called one school, which profiles each of the state's
[1:46:34.280 --> 1:46:40.760]  480,000 public school students enrolled from kindergarten to 12th grade. In other words,
[1:46:40.760 --> 1:46:47.440]  your entire school career and it has photographs, personal details, career aspirations, off-campus
[1:46:47.440 --> 1:46:54.040]  activities, student performance records, they're all there. 1251 schools, public access and
[1:46:54.040 --> 1:46:59.000]  the headline is database fuels pedophile fears. Well, more than just pedophile fears,
[1:46:59.000 --> 1:47:04.120]  just the fact that somebody can run an actual profile of you before you even get out of
[1:47:04.120 --> 1:47:10.480]  high school and it's open to everybody. It's, it's outrageous. Privacy is gone. Okay. They're
[1:47:10.480 --> 1:47:17.400]  trying to talk about the possible stalking from X lovers, X boyfriends, X girlfriends,
[1:47:17.400 --> 1:47:22.560]  being able to, to stalk these individuals or others. This, this really has to be stopped.
[1:47:22.560 --> 1:47:26.880]  People like Captain Albrecht who have, have taken this all the way up to a national level
[1:47:26.880 --> 1:47:31.880]  and who, who goes to hearings and, and is a very professional, very articulate speaker
[1:47:31.880 --> 1:47:36.280]  on these is, is doing her best to make sure that at least safeguards are put in that we
[1:47:36.280 --> 1:47:40.240]  can slow this technology down and the things that are coming to patents that she's dug
[1:47:40.240 --> 1:47:45.960]  up for what they plan to implement against us is extremely scary. So we, before it gets
[1:47:45.960 --> 1:47:50.680]  out, before it becomes mainstream, before you see parasitil mothers on TV, uh, touting
[1:47:50.680 --> 1:47:55.040]  their new verichip and walking around and reading their IDs at home and, and being able
[1:47:55.040 --> 1:47:58.320]  to, to purchase things just with the wave of their hand. We need to get everybody aware
[1:47:58.320 --> 1:48:03.400]  of this technology, aware of the dangers and aware of the entire plan and just continue
[1:48:03.400 --> 1:48:08.160]  to, uh, to inform the people in a peaceful, civilly information outreach because I think
[1:48:08.160 --> 1:48:11.760]  we've slowed the verichip down and they've been planning this for quite some time. Last
[1:48:11.760 --> 1:48:16.160]  I checked their, their chip stock was just dropping like a stone and I think that they
[1:48:16.160 --> 1:48:20.400]  have probably had planned that they would be implemented by now, uh, here in this country
[1:48:20.400 --> 1:48:24.680]  if it wasn't for good patriots opposing it, I have to agree with you there. And you just
[1:48:24.680 --> 1:48:30.480]  mentioned, you know, not having to have an ID. Well, the U S is now barring ID, refuse
[1:48:30.480 --> 1:48:35.120]  NICs from planes, but not ID losers. This, uh, this is out of the register. So in other
[1:48:35.120 --> 1:48:38.360]  words, you know, usually you have to show a license to get on a plane. I've had to
[1:48:38.360 --> 1:48:42.480]  board planes, my license is in rough shape. I mean, it's burnt. It's got holes in it,
[1:48:42.480 --> 1:48:45.680]  blah, blah, blah. I usually have to argue with the people, but what they're saying
[1:48:45.680 --> 1:48:50.200]  now is before you could say, look, I don't have an ID. They'll put you through some additional
[1:48:50.200 --> 1:48:54.440]  screening you get on the plane. They're now saying, no, no dice. The only way that you're
[1:48:54.440 --> 1:48:57.600]  going to get on the plane is if you accidentally forget it and then I'm sure you're going to
[1:48:57.600 --> 1:49:01.960]  have to jump through a million different hoops. But as you just said, you know, this will
[1:49:01.960 --> 1:49:05.400]  eventually go to the system where it's going to be like, well, you know, leave your ID
[1:49:05.400 --> 1:49:08.480]  at home. You don't need your ID. It's going to be with you at all times. They're going
[1:49:08.480 --> 1:49:12.360]  to scan your hand or they're going to scan your arm and then you'll be able to get on
[1:49:12.360 --> 1:49:16.480]  the plane. And since nobody's able to hack these things, Mark, which is a total lie,
[1:49:16.480 --> 1:49:20.440]  very easily hackable, you know, we're going to know who you are. And that's a good idea.
[1:49:20.440 --> 1:49:26.680]  That scares me that somebody who hacks an RFID chip, especially somebody who would potentially
[1:49:26.680 --> 1:49:31.320]  do his harm will be able to easily get on a plane. We'll be able to easily, you know,
[1:49:31.320 --> 1:49:35.440]  go about, you know, his business, especially, you know, in places like DC where there are
[1:49:35.440 --> 1:49:39.920]  all these secure areas, how easy is it going to be to hack a chip and people to infiltrate
[1:49:39.920 --> 1:49:44.520]  these places? People aren't looking at the negatives. They're always promoting the positives
[1:49:44.520 --> 1:49:48.240]  because this is a tool for our enslavement, Mark. Mark, why don't you give out the website?
[1:49:48.240 --> 1:49:53.280]  Tell people how they can get involved in the soldiers program really quick before the break.
[1:49:53.280 --> 1:49:58.800]  All the information's at markdice.com. Just scroll down, find operation, inform the soldiers.
[1:49:58.800 --> 1:50:03.040]  All the information's there about how to sign up so you can email the troops, cost you nothing.
[1:50:03.040 --> 1:50:07.320]  There's also organizations there in the press release where you can sign up and get addresses
[1:50:07.320 --> 1:50:12.080]  of troops. And again, try not to send the DVDs with the covers, with the boxes. Somebody
[1:50:12.080 --> 1:50:16.880]  might see that and think that they don't want it to get to the troops. So maybe put a different
[1:50:16.880 --> 1:50:21.480]  label, put it in a different box, just say this is a cool DVD, write your letters. And
[1:50:21.480 --> 1:50:25.800]  let's just get that information out. It's called Operation Inform the Soldiers. There's
[1:50:25.800 --> 1:50:30.080]  a press release about Michael Savage's death, or Michael Reagan's death threats, rather.
[1:50:30.080 --> 1:50:34.320]  And please get that out to the media. As far as I know, no major media has covered this
[1:50:34.320 --> 1:50:39.720]  other than you guys and raw stories. So this needs to get out. He needs to be on fire.
[1:50:39.720 --> 1:50:42.680]  People need to know what it is that they're doing out there and calling for our death.
[1:50:42.680 --> 1:50:51.400]  All right. Thanks, Mark. It's the Alex Jones show. We'll be back after this.
[1:50:51.400 --> 1:50:55.400]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees. The forces of globalism are destroying national
[1:50:55.400 --> 1:51:00.240]  sovereignty worldwide. But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope. The first time in modern
[1:51:00.240 --> 1:51:05.080]  history, the people are beginning to wake up. It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate
[1:51:05.080 --> 1:51:08.960]  their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan. We have a short time
[1:51:08.960 --> 1:51:14.760]  frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat. In the info war, prisonplanet.tv

[1:51:54.880 --> 1:51:59.280]  in the body is the single largest cause of disease such as cancer or diabetes? Acidic
[1:51:59.280 --> 1:52:03.520]  waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment and our high
[1:52:03.520 --> 1:52:08.120]  stress lifestyles. It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain and eventually
[1:52:08.120 --> 1:52:13.120]  disease. The easiest way to reduce disease causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline
[1:52:13.120 --> 1:52:18.080]  ionized water. At SnyderHealth.com we offer a full line of alkaline water ionizers from

[1:54:13.080 --> 1:54:42.680]  Alright folks, we're back. The Alex Jones Show.
[1:54:43.200 --> 1:54:47.920]  Jason Burma is going to be subbing in for the rest of the week. I want to remind everybody
[1:54:47.920 --> 1:54:52.680]  that Alex's latest film, the 9-11 Chronicles, Truth Rising, which I was lucky enough to
[1:54:52.680 --> 1:54:55.880]  do the cover for. I hope the kids like it out there. I did a little poster for it too.
[1:54:55.880 --> 1:55:00.800]  There should be being posted soon. But on July 4th, PrisonPlanet.tv members are going
[1:55:00.800 --> 1:55:05.480]  to get the movie. And it should be exciting because this is a brand new, almost two-hour
[1:55:05.480 --> 1:55:10.640]  flick that really goes into the 9-11 Truth Movement. I mean, it's unlike anything Alex
[1:55:10.640 --> 1:55:17.640]  has done before. This is shot cinema verite. No voiceover. Really, Luke Radowski takes us
[1:55:17.640 --> 1:55:24.000]  on a journey on the struggle to get 9-11 Truth out there to confront our criminal, globalist
[1:55:24.000 --> 1:55:30.240]  overlords and also the struggle to get people to recognize the fact that the first responders
[1:55:30.240 --> 1:55:35.360]  are being ignored after they were lied to and essentially given a death sentence, a
[1:55:35.360 --> 1:55:41.200]  painful death sentence. So that's all in there. We of course got Koos Koos Kacinich in there
[1:55:41.200 --> 1:55:47.440]  who is really my new hero. I love Dennis Kacinich. Again, a bit of a gun grabber, a bit of a
[1:55:47.440 --> 1:55:53.560]  left leaner, sure. But 35 articles of impeachment, the last three having to do with 9-11, first
[1:55:53.560 --> 1:56:00.840]  off, that they actually lied about 9-11. They didn't investigate it. They tried to
[1:56:00.840 --> 1:56:05.480]  get that investigation out that they obstructed justice, I believe was the second one. He
[1:56:05.480 --> 1:56:09.860]  mentioned how Bush and Cheney actually testified together, not under oath, only before two
[1:56:09.860 --> 1:56:14.960]  commissioners with no record of what they said. And of course, the third is the lying
[1:56:14.960 --> 1:56:21.040]  about the air quality in order to open up a Wall Street costing literally thousands
[1:56:21.040 --> 1:56:26.000]  of New Yorkers their lives and really putting a strain on their families is just totally
[1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:32.720]  disgusting. And when I think of disgusting health issues, there are none as disgusting
[1:56:32.720 --> 1:56:37.080]  as this one. Last week I was in a 7-11. Alex made a cover to none of the show last week,
[1:56:37.080 --> 1:56:42.880]  but I've got to cover it again. And I'm sitting there, getting my slurpee, my disgusting,
[1:56:42.880 --> 1:56:47.240]  you know, my terrible food that I shouldn't be eating. And I see this Time Magazine cover
[1:56:47.240 --> 1:56:51.280]  and it's a baby on the cover. And I had just had a conversation with one of my good friends
[1:56:51.280 --> 1:56:58.920]  who is actually a teacher and he was asking me how his sister and her husband would approach
[1:56:58.920 --> 1:57:04.120]  the situation when, you know, the new baby was born and they didn't want to take the
[1:57:04.120 --> 1:57:08.920]  vaccines. And I simply informed him like, look, from the very get go, you need to say, look,
[1:57:08.920 --> 1:57:14.600]  my kid's not taking these vaccinations. I want the conscientious objector waiver. I'm
[1:57:14.600 --> 1:57:19.240]  not putting thimerosal on my kid. I'm not putting SV40 in my kid. I know what's in these
[1:57:19.240 --> 1:57:23.120]  preservatives. Okay. And they're going to give you the run around. It's not going to
[1:57:23.120 --> 1:57:29.040]  be easy. So I'm in this 7-11 and I look at this Time Magazine cover and it's this baby
[1:57:29.040 --> 1:57:34.720]  looking up at somebody about to give him a shot. The baby looks worried. It then says
[1:57:34.720 --> 1:57:38.680]  the truth about vaccines. And at this point, I think it's going to be able to go either
[1:57:38.680 --> 1:57:44.320]  way. You know, it's showing, you know, this infant about to get a shot uncomfortably. Well,
[1:57:44.320 --> 1:57:48.160]  it says worried about autism. Many parents are opting out of immunizations. How they're
[1:57:48.160 --> 1:57:52.360]  putting the rest of us at risk. And then it goes on like a five-page diatribe about how
[1:57:52.360 --> 1:57:56.600]  we're all bad environments. I want you to cover that next hour. I now am actually leaving
[1:57:56.600 --> 1:58:00.280]  to go spend time with my family. But for about two months, I've been trying to set Jordan
[1:58:00.280 --> 1:58:04.000]  Maxwell up, but he's been in bad health and stuff because he put a call out for help.
[1:58:04.000 --> 1:58:07.960]  I want to try to support him game on and sell some of his products. And they're making some
[1:58:07.960 --> 1:58:12.240]  confusion about getting him on the show. He will be on the show for two hours next Monday.
[1:58:12.240 --> 1:58:16.360]  Somebody sent me an email. He won't have Jordan Maxwell on. That's ridiculous. So we're going
[1:58:16.360 --> 1:58:22.680]  to have a Jordan Maxwell, a great guy on for two hours on the show next Monday. So I look
[1:58:22.680 --> 1:58:26.160]  forward to that, everybody. Sounds good. It's the Alex Jones show. We'll be back after this.
[1:58:26.160 --> 1:58:38.680]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:38.680 --> 1:58:49.400]  It is a big idea. A New World Order. In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful
[1:58:49.400 --> 1:58:56.360]  world government. It's known as the Builder Bird. Could their objective be world domination?
[1:58:56.360 --> 1:59:01.760]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the New World
[1:59:01.760 --> 1:59:10.560]  Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand. For the first time
[1:59:10.560 --> 1:59:16.280]  in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open. You will learn the secret
[1:59:16.280 --> 1:59:20.800]  that drives the entire New World Order agenda. Builder Bird is making great progress for
[1:59:20.800 --> 1:59:23.920]  the world government. Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all
[1:59:23.920 --> 1:59:28.760]  the money they need. They're after power. That's their after-easy. Order in game on DVD

[1:59:35.760 --> 1:59:43.760]  In game, blueprint for global enslavement. You have been warned.
[1:59:43.760 --> 1:59:55.920]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Networks.
[1:59:55.920 --> 2:00:05.640]  You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now,
[2:00:05.640 --> 2:00:11.280]  live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:11.280 --> 2:00:15.480]  Alright folks, we're back and we should have Jonathan Elenoff as we are changed Colorado
[2:00:15.480 --> 2:00:21.040]  on in a moment. But first I want to go over the story I was just talking about. How safe
[2:00:21.040 --> 2:00:28.200]  are vaccines? Well, they're admitting, and I think it might actually be a little bit
[2:00:28.200 --> 2:00:34.440]  more than this, that by the time your child is two years old, they get 28 vaccinations.
[2:00:34.440 --> 2:00:41.240]  28 vaccinations. Think about that. It's a lot. Okay? And then they're saying, oh, only
[2:00:41.240 --> 2:00:45.400]  two to three percent are opting out. I'd say it's more to five to 10 percent and really
[2:00:45.400 --> 2:00:52.680]  growing to 10 to 20 percent after people like Oprah Winfrey give this a forum to mainstream
[2:00:52.680 --> 2:00:59.760]  America after people like Jenny McCarthy and Jim Carrey March on Washington saying, look,
[2:00:59.760 --> 2:01:06.000]  they have thimerosal on the vaccines. It's a poison. It causes autism. My kid got autism
[2:01:06.000 --> 2:01:11.280]  from the shots. He wasn't born autistic. He obviously got it from the shots. And the
[2:01:11.280 --> 2:01:14.780]  one thing I don't agree with is the fact that they're wearing shirts that say green are
[2:01:14.780 --> 2:01:19.080]  vaccines. No, just take the poison out. Okay? We don't need to put this in with the green
[2:01:19.080 --> 2:01:24.040]  movement. Okay? That's just ridiculous. See, that's more propaganda trying to promote,
[2:01:24.040 --> 2:01:28.640]  you know, let's go green. We all need to recycle and we need to have a carbon tax for global
[2:01:28.640 --> 2:01:33.000]  warming. It's great. So I don't, I don't really approve of that, but at least they're coming
[2:01:33.000 --> 2:01:39.680]  out there saying, look, vaccines are bad. And I do like the fact that they're showing
[2:01:39.680 --> 2:01:45.000]  that it's not just a religious waiver. It's also a philosophical of exemption waiver.
[2:01:45.000 --> 2:01:48.960]  But schools are really trying to rush towards get rid of that as well. You know, they total
[2:01:48.960 --> 2:01:56.000]  tyranny, total color law. There's no law saying you have to take this stuff. Look, it's poison.
[2:01:56.000 --> 2:01:59.480]  Mercury is not good for your brain. No matter how many times the local news runs and ads
[2:01:59.480 --> 2:02:07.000]  saying that mercury helps your brain, it's not true. It's poison. Poison. So I'm only,
[2:02:07.000 --> 2:02:12.040]  I'm only thankful, you know, that my buddy's waking up that, you know, he is a teacher.
[2:02:12.040 --> 2:02:17.400]  He can influence other people, you know, in the administration, you know, at his school
[2:02:17.400 --> 2:02:21.760]  and say, look, you know, this, this isn't good. And I just want to give a big props
[2:02:21.760 --> 2:02:26.080]  to him, you know, for doing that because it takes, takes some bravery to do that.
[2:02:26.080 --> 2:02:31.600]  All right. We have Jonathan Ellen off on the line. And in case you didn't know, we are
[2:02:31.600 --> 2:02:37.080]  changed Colorado last week was arrested for handing out DVDs for free. The police claim
[2:02:37.080 --> 2:02:41.120]  that this was peddling, even though they were not taking any money and that what they
[2:02:41.120 --> 2:02:46.480]  were doing was covered under free speech. It's the same thing as when you're handed
[2:02:46.480 --> 2:02:54.880]  a pamphlet, a booklet, you know, a poster, a card, information. That's all the DVD is.
[2:02:54.880 --> 2:02:57.640]  Yet they decided to arrest some people. Didn't they, Jonathan?
[2:02:57.640 --> 2:03:02.560]  That's right. They did. And the funny thing is, is I just posted a video today that we
[2:03:02.560 --> 2:03:08.960]  found in our archive when Sandra Hicks was out a while back when cops showed up at the
[2:03:08.960 --> 2:03:15.200]  exact same location on 16th and Weldon. And they were actually called on us. And we called
[2:03:15.200 --> 2:03:18.320]  the cops, the local security guard called the cops because they said, well, handing
[2:03:18.320 --> 2:03:23.120]  out DVDs was illegal. And standard and debated with them right there. The cop showed up.
[2:03:23.120 --> 2:03:27.320]  We got this all on camera, by the way. And the police officer said, no, of course it's
[2:03:27.320 --> 2:03:30.680]  not illegal. What you're doing is protected by the First Amendment. Try not to block the
[2:03:30.680 --> 2:03:35.360]  sidewalk. And he told us to have a nice day and drove off.
[2:03:35.360 --> 2:03:39.640]  And that's posted over at loosechange91.com. Both videos are just that one.
[2:03:39.640 --> 2:03:46.480]  Yes, both videos. So people can see clearly that Denver police must be confused on where
[2:03:46.480 --> 2:03:50.960]  their stand is because I've got video of them basically on both sides of the issue.
[2:03:50.960 --> 2:03:55.720]  Well, I'm very glad that you have that because that's going to be presented in court. I don't
[2:03:55.720 --> 2:03:58.800]  want to see these people settle. I don't want to see them take a ticket for what they've
[2:03:58.800 --> 2:04:04.200]  done. Look, we're trying to save this country, Jonathan. We're trying to give out free information
[2:04:04.200 --> 2:04:11.320]  that literally, literally folks, it's life or death, life or death information. If you
[2:04:11.320 --> 2:04:16.760]  don't know the government, our government is involved in false flag terror, you need
[2:04:16.760 --> 2:04:21.600]  to know. Okay, you need to know the system is controlled. Okay, we got Jonathan Ellen
[2:04:21.600 --> 2:04:26.280]  off from We Are Changed Colorado. I am Jason Burmuss. Remember, Truth Rising coming to
[2:04:26.280 --> 2:04:31.320]  PrismPlanet.tv July 4th, and it'll be shipping out just around that time too. So definitely
[2:04:31.320 --> 2:04:36.120]  check it out. The 9-Eleven Chronicles. Badass film by Alex Jones. We'll be back after this.
[2:04:36.120 --> 2:04:37.120]  It's the Alex Jones show.
[2:04:37.120 --> 2:04:53.640]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror, loose change, final cut, in-game blueprint
[2:04:53.640 --> 2:04:58.640]  for global enslavement, the true story of the Bilderberg group, the late-rate USA, America,
[2:04:58.640 --> 2:05:02.840]  freedom to fascism. These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films
[2:05:02.840 --> 2:05:07.840]  that are available at PrismPlanet.tv.
[2:05:47.720 --> 2:05:52.560]  Hi, neighbor. This is Steve Shank, Fearless Task Force. Life is a gamble, but you can
[2:05:52.560 --> 2:05:58.320]  stack the deck. If you knew what I know about all the problems food will protect you from,
[2:05:58.320 --> 2:06:02.640]  you'd start immediately to put every effort and dollar you can get into the biggest supply
[2:06:02.640 --> 2:06:08.480]  of food possible. When the dollar and economy crash, when the imported and genetically poisoned
[2:06:08.480 --> 2:06:13.880]  food is all that's left, when the quarantine and bird flu hit, our only protection and
[2:06:13.880 --> 2:06:18.920]  only chance to be fearless is having control of our own supply of food and enough of it.
[2:06:18.920 --> 2:06:22.600]  But if you knew what we haven't yet discovered, you wouldn't waste time listening to the rest
[2:06:22.600 --> 2:06:28.080]  of this announcement before charging out and getting a serious food supply. Decide it's
[2:06:28.080 --> 2:06:35.080]  food now or probably never. But can you afford to be wrong? Decide now. Place your bet. Can
[2:06:35.200 --> 2:06:42.200]  you afford to be wrong? Call 800-409-5633 on the Web eFoodsDirect.com. Call 800-409-5633.
[2:06:48.120 --> 2:06:52.400]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced
[2:06:52.400 --> 2:06:57.200]  alkaline environment. But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic
[2:06:57.200 --> 2:07:02.080]  diet and lack of exercise. pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect
[2:07:02.080 --> 2:07:07.000]  health as well as prevention of disease. People who alkalize the water they drink experience
[2:07:07.000 --> 2:07:11.480]  normalized blood sugar, mental clarity and loss of weight. It was intended for human
[2:07:11.480 --> 2:07:15.880]  beings to drink alkaline water. But due to modern way of life, most people are overly
[2:07:15.880 --> 2:07:21.200]  acidic. The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment. Fat accumulates
[2:07:21.200 --> 2:07:26.800]  if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it. Do your part.
[2:07:26.800 --> 2:07:31.760]  Disease and supercharge your body now. Alkavision plasma pH drops contain a special mineral
[2:07:31.760 --> 2:07:37.040]  salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink up to the pH of 10 with only
[2:07:37.040 --> 2:07:44.040]  10 drops. Order your bottle of Alkavision plasma pH drops now by going directly to alkavision.com.
[2:07:44.040 --> 2:07:56.840]  Again, that's alkavision.com.
[2:07:56.840 --> 2:08:02.920]  Alright folks, we are back with Jonathan Elenoff. We are in Colorado, but before we get back
[2:08:02.920 --> 2:08:07.560]  into the fact that we still do have a First Amendment, we are allowed to give out free
[2:08:07.560 --> 2:08:14.160]  DVDs and information. Again, trying to spread the truth, I want to thank a couple of our
[2:08:14.160 --> 2:08:20.040]  sponsors. Our sponsors make this show possible. Make things like InfoWars.com, PrismPlanet.com,
[2:08:20.040 --> 2:08:26.560]  InfoWars.net and JonesReport.com possible. We all know that stress weakens your mind
[2:08:26.560 --> 2:08:31.080]  inhibiting your ability to focus on the things that truly matter. Fight back with inner food.
[2:08:31.080 --> 2:08:35.440]  Practically everyone else up here are absolutely addicted to this stuff and for all the best
[2:08:35.440 --> 2:08:39.360]  reasons. Again, there really is inner food in the office. I should actually grab a can
[2:08:39.360 --> 2:08:43.760]  of that. People throw it in their coffee in the morning, their juice. Inner food is nature's
[2:08:43.760 --> 2:08:49.240]  100% all-natural organic superfood with no GMOs, fillers or sweeteners, just 20 power-packed
[2:08:49.240 --> 2:08:53.000]  ingredients that will sharpen your mind and give you the energy you need. You get everything
[2:08:53.000 --> 2:09:00.000]  you need for less than a dollar a day. Go to www.enerfood.com. That's enerfood.com or

[2:09:11.640 --> 2:09:17.480]  I got to tell you after taking this stuff, my brother is big into those throttle drinks
[2:09:17.480 --> 2:09:22.840]  and Red Bull and all that stuff. I can't drink that stuff. It's syrupy. It tastes like gross.
[2:09:22.840 --> 2:09:28.840]  It's got caffeine in it. It's like a big boost. It's just totally and completely disgusting.
[2:09:28.840 --> 2:09:33.560]  Now, when I first tried inner food, I tried it like 2.30 in the morning. It was like my
[2:09:33.560 --> 2:09:39.560]  first week here. I'm really trying to drive this movie through. I was shocked at the energy
[2:09:39.560 --> 2:09:45.760]  boost that I got. I really didn't get a crash. That was weird to me. It wasn't a crash. It
[2:09:45.760 --> 2:09:50.920]  was kind of a slow mellow out. It kind of goes away, but inner food's good stuff, guys.
[2:09:50.920 --> 2:09:56.720]  Also, new vitality alloys. With all the junk we eat, it's important to do your very best
[2:09:56.720 --> 2:10:00.800]  to take care of our digestive system. New vitality, one of our great sponsors, had
[2:10:00.800 --> 2:10:06.680]  a product called AlloEase. AlloEase is an herbal dietary supplement developed to support healthy

[2:10:26.960 --> 2:10:34.520]  That's 1-800-569-4056. Now, Jonathan, you have really taken off this
[2:10:34.520 --> 2:10:39.040]  year really bow by the horns is how I like to call it. I mean, you started the We Are
[2:10:39.040 --> 2:10:44.440]  Change chapter in Colorado. You've confronted numerous political figures about the New World
[2:10:44.440 --> 2:10:50.520]  Order, globalization, 9-11. I mean, you're all over the place and you're not too busy
[2:10:50.520 --> 2:10:53.920]  to educate the little guy, which is what we're about. I mean, you're out on the streets handing
[2:10:53.920 --> 2:10:58.920]  out DVDs and now they're trying to criminalize that. Why don't you just go over that?
[2:10:58.920 --> 2:11:04.720]  Well, obviously, we've got a coming police state. Well, we're already actually in a
[2:11:04.720 --> 2:11:09.280]  police state. We've been in one for a while. I think we've got a coming martial law, a
[2:11:09.280 --> 2:11:13.720]  more intensive police state. For those who don't know, actually, martial law is really
[2:11:13.720 --> 2:11:17.800]  already going on if you look at some of the acts that were passed in executive orders.
[2:11:17.800 --> 2:11:24.600]  So the military and the police have all kinds of exempted kinds of powers and privileges
[2:11:24.600 --> 2:11:32.320]  and they're using them all the time. In Denver, for instance, for the DNC protests, they passed
[2:11:32.320 --> 2:11:40.600]  all these laws that are not just unconstitutional, but they're illegal. For I'll give you an
[2:11:40.600 --> 2:11:45.000]  example of one that they did. For instance, you cannot protest, hold a sign, wear a shirt
[2:11:45.000 --> 2:11:48.640]  with a political ring to it, anything without a permit.
[2:11:48.640 --> 2:11:54.240]  And that was done in 2000 in Seattle, where literally people were not allowed to walk
[2:11:54.240 --> 2:12:01.440]  to work if they had an anti-WTO button on, folks. Free speech is over, but continue.
[2:12:01.440 --> 2:12:07.400]  In order to get these permits, you have to go through this lottery process, which is
[2:12:07.400 --> 2:12:13.080]  supposed to be transparent, it's not. And let's just say, hypothetically, you get one
[2:12:13.080 --> 2:12:16.920]  of these permits, you can't even go where you'd like to go and say what you'd like
[2:12:16.920 --> 2:12:21.680]  to say or wear what you want to wear. They have these designated free speech zones where
[2:12:21.680 --> 2:12:25.800]  you can go and even then the press is not going to be covering them because they're
[2:12:25.800 --> 2:12:31.840]  two and a quarter miles away from the actual DNC convention itself. So we're talking
[2:12:31.840 --> 2:12:33.720]  major violation of civil liberty.
[2:12:33.720 --> 2:12:39.600]  Well, these free speech zones are there to squelch dissent. They're there to make the
[2:12:39.600 --> 2:12:44.920]  appearance that there is nobody upset with what's going on. And it's also there to try
[2:12:44.920 --> 2:12:49.120]  to appease those who think they have a First Amendment, Jonathan. I mean, they did this
[2:12:49.120 --> 2:12:55.400]  back in 2004 at the DNC over in Boston, which was absolutely ridiculous. Alex Jones got
[2:12:55.400 --> 2:12:59.880]  some really good pictures up on infowars.com. If you go to the archives and you can see
[2:12:59.880 --> 2:13:05.240]  the jackboat cops, literally in big black uniforms, people were smart enough to scroll
[2:13:05.240 --> 2:13:12.760]  1984 into the sidewalks. And really, that to me was the beginning of this free speech
[2:13:12.760 --> 2:13:16.720]  zone mentality. They're not going to give you a place where you're going to be heard.
[2:13:16.720 --> 2:13:19.520]  They're not going to give you a place where your message is going to get across. They're
[2:13:19.520 --> 2:13:24.960]  going to put you miles away from the event so you cannot have an effect. And they're
[2:13:24.960 --> 2:13:29.760]  saying, well, it's too bad. We're going to arrest you otherwise. What is going on with
[2:13:29.760 --> 2:13:34.760]  the DNC right now? I know you're still planning to go there. Who else is planning to go to
[2:13:34.760 --> 2:13:36.760]  the DNC?
[2:13:36.760 --> 2:13:45.160]  Well, what's going on right now is a successfully dismantled two groups that look like that
[2:13:45.160 --> 2:13:48.480]  they were going to be. They were actually planning demonstrations that were going to
[2:13:48.480 --> 2:13:53.760]  put protesters within arms length of police officers. One protest was surrounding the
[2:13:53.760 --> 2:14:01.400]  Denver Mint, literally 25 feet from the actual county jail. And I actually effectively dismantled
[2:14:01.400 --> 2:14:05.920]  those groups. And most of the people who have broken away now from that group have formed
[2:14:05.920 --> 2:14:11.680]  a new group that is calling for nonviolent. In fact, I know many of the people in that
[2:14:11.680 --> 2:14:12.680]  group.
[2:14:12.680 --> 2:14:16.880]  Which just shows the incredible power one person can have, folks. Jonathan Elenoff is
[2:14:16.880 --> 2:14:19.040]  making those changes. Continue.
[2:14:19.040 --> 2:14:23.880]  Right. And I'm good friends with a lot of people. There's a new group called Alliance
[2:14:23.880 --> 2:14:28.760]  for Real Democracy. And it's a bunch of people who they had no idea the groups I was talking
[2:14:28.760 --> 2:14:32.160]  about were going to be violent until they looked at the demonstrations that I helped
[2:14:32.160 --> 2:14:36.640]  expose, which not too many people knew about. I went to some core meetings and was able
[2:14:36.640 --> 2:14:41.920]  to get all this information out to the public. And they all agreed there was no message to
[2:14:41.920 --> 2:14:48.360]  the demonstrations. The demonstrations were designed to put people in aggravated situations
[2:14:48.360 --> 2:14:53.360]  and agitated situations that were going to put them literally within arms length of cost.
[2:14:53.360 --> 2:14:58.880]  And they all broke away. They're making a big stance for peace. But I did a lot of harm
[2:14:58.880 --> 2:15:05.040]  to that group in terms of them. They can't get funding. All tends to universities broken
[2:15:05.040 --> 2:15:10.040]  away from them. All these people are now breaking away from them. And it's been interesting
[2:15:10.040 --> 2:15:13.240]  there's been a split. There's some people who don't like me because of the work I've
[2:15:13.240 --> 2:15:17.840]  had to make. The extra work people have now had to do because of what I was saying.
[2:15:17.840 --> 2:15:20.720]  Well, I'm sorry. You know what? If they don't like it, it's too bad. If you're not going
[2:15:20.720 --> 2:15:23.680]  to follow the Constitution of the Bill of Rights, if you're going to try to provocateur
[2:15:23.680 --> 2:15:27.960]  an event where you throw paint on people, where you bring a shield, okay, where you
[2:15:27.960 --> 2:15:32.680]  try to upset police into attacking you, something needs to be done, Jonathan. And you did that.
[2:15:32.680 --> 2:15:34.160]  You know, that's the bottom line.
[2:15:34.160 --> 2:15:38.240]  Well, and in the demonstrations speak for themselves. I mean, surrounding the Denver
[2:15:38.240 --> 2:15:41.880]  Mint had no message to it. And I asked them about that. What was the point of surrounding
[2:15:41.880 --> 2:15:46.160]  the Mint? They said, well, you know, the economy is getting bad. And I said, well, the lost
[2:15:46.160 --> 2:15:50.080]  state, according to when we went to the Mint National Security Guard, that if you attempt
[2:15:50.080 --> 2:15:54.160]  to obstruct that fence or vandalize it or surround it, they can actually chew chew on
[2:15:54.160 --> 2:16:00.200]  the site. And they had a whole demonstration to surround angry, radical protesters that
[2:16:00.200 --> 2:16:03.600]  surround that Mint, which is located right across the street from the jail, where the
[2:16:03.600 --> 2:16:05.960]  police are setting up their headquarters.
[2:16:05.960 --> 2:16:12.000]  And by the way, they love violence. They crave death, especially prior to the RNC. You know,
[2:16:12.000 --> 2:16:17.920]  they get something done at the DNC. You know what I'm saying? Then the RNC is, I mean totally
[2:16:17.920 --> 2:16:21.800]  off limits. Let's say someone got shot and killed at the DMC protesting. There would
[2:16:21.800 --> 2:16:28.000]  be no chance of any kind of free speech whatsoever within a five to 10 mile radius of where they
[2:16:28.000 --> 2:16:32.400]  hold the RNC. I guarantee that. And, you know, it would just be out there to, you know, try
[2:16:32.400 --> 2:16:36.880]  to parade this false left right paradigm in front of all of us saying, Oh, look at the
[2:16:36.880 --> 2:16:42.360]  left. Look at the left. They can't even stop from acting like animals. You know, and then
[2:16:42.360 --> 2:16:45.680]  they'll seriously, that's what they'll do. And they'll show, Oh, see, this is why you
[2:16:45.680 --> 2:16:51.600]  need to be a Republican, further ingraining Republican Democrat, conservative, liberal
[2:16:51.600 --> 2:16:57.400]  into people's minds when we are about freedom. We are about the Constitution. We are about
[2:16:57.400 --> 2:17:02.360]  the bill of rights and being a free humanity. I don't know about you, but I was actually
[2:17:02.360 --> 2:17:08.000]  ecstatic with the fact that the Supreme Court ruled that habeas corpus is still in effect.
[2:17:08.000 --> 2:17:13.000]  And then you see fear mongers like Newt Gingrich and McCain come out and say, Oh, now a, you
[2:17:13.000 --> 2:17:17.320]  know, a U.S. city is going to blow up and it's on their heads. And this is the worst
[2:17:17.320 --> 2:17:21.360]  decision ever. It sounds pretty suspect to me. By the way, folks, I'm going to be taking
[2:17:21.360 --> 2:17:25.600]  your call. So hopefully in the next segment, Jonathan and I will be answering questions
[2:17:25.600 --> 2:17:30.240]  for you. But why don't you tell people, at least in your area, how they can get involved
[2:17:30.240 --> 2:17:34.000]  in we are changed? Because these are the groups that are having an effect, Jonathan. These
[2:17:34.000 --> 2:17:37.440]  are the groups that are on the front lines. These are the groups that are handing out
[2:17:37.440 --> 2:17:42.320]  DVDs that aren't cowering towards the jackboot officers that are saying, you don't have a
[2:17:42.320 --> 2:17:48.920]  rat to hand out. No DVDs. You're peddling. You're a peddler. So how can you join?
[2:17:48.920 --> 2:17:56.320]  Oh, we have, uh, we have, we are changed Colorado.org, which is the activist front truth alliance
[2:17:56.320 --> 2:18:00.280]  done that, which is working on tons of projects right now. I know they're, uh, we have a new
[2:18:00.280 --> 2:18:04.520]  we are changed hub site. The actual just we are changed out of our G side is being redone
[2:18:04.520 --> 2:18:07.920]  by truth alliance. It looks phenomenal. I've already, already seen it. Hopefully that'll
[2:18:07.920 --> 2:18:13.320]  be done soon. They're working on a United peace and justice, a peace march for the first
[2:18:13.320 --> 2:18:18.800]  responders and family members to get something visual to get attention. 9 11. Uh, so I know
[2:18:18.800 --> 2:18:22.000]  there's a lot of stuff going on. We have projects up and down that we're trying to finish. I
[2:18:22.000 --> 2:18:27.560]  have a film, a core of corruption that's going to be coming out and hopefully, and, um, you
[2:18:27.560 --> 2:18:33.320]  know, there's always something going on handing out DVDs. We have massive, massive 800 to
[2:18:33.320 --> 2:18:38.000]  a thousand DVDs. We hand out a week in Colorado. So we know we're hitting them and we're hitting
[2:18:38.000 --> 2:18:43.800]  them hard. Um, what's interesting, I wanted to mention, we're actually in our own struggle
[2:18:43.800 --> 2:18:48.040]  with alliance for real democracy. They've banned we are changed from being a part of
[2:18:48.040 --> 2:18:52.640]  them, uh, because we blew the whistle on violent protests and, uh, caused a bunch of people
[2:18:52.640 --> 2:18:58.960]  to work actually over time to get grants and stuff. They don't like us. And, uh, so we're,
[2:18:58.960 --> 2:19:03.280]  we're trying to figure out why we're the group that blew the whistle so that people could
[2:19:03.280 --> 2:19:09.680]  be peaceful. And anyways, it's really weird. So we're starting to, um, we're starting to
[2:19:09.680 --> 2:19:14.080]  look at this and hopefully people get the message. Look, if it's not one group, it'll
[2:19:14.080 --> 2:19:19.840]  be another or it'll be an individual. Someone's going to plan something to make us look bad.
[2:19:19.840 --> 2:19:24.640]  Uh, we got to keep our head up and we got to look for the stuff and we can't, we can't
[2:19:24.640 --> 2:19:26.360]  expel anybody.
[2:19:26.360 --> 2:19:32.200]  That's right. PrismPlanet.com, infowars.com are the websites. Remember 9 11 truth rising,

[2:24:17.040 --> 2:24:19.920]  Are Changed Colorado on the line and we're going to go to your phone calls, bunch of
[2:24:19.920 --> 2:24:26.960]  California calls to go to. Sunny California, let me tell you, sunny Texas is ultra hot.
[2:24:26.960 --> 2:24:31.400]  I step outside. It's 100 plus. I'm dying out here. I can't wait to get back to New York.
[2:24:31.400 --> 2:24:36.240]  I can't lie. Before we get back into things and taking your calls, I just want to let

[2:24:40.160 --> 2:24:44.720]  sure thing. Storing food for your family is one of the most prudent actions you can take.

[2:24:49.080 --> 2:24:54.840]  do know that out in New York's rationing how much rice you can buy at BJ's Wholesale
[2:24:54.840 --> 2:25:00.320]  Club and Sam's Club and it's crazy. Three bags of rice per visit. That's just un-American.

[2:25:33.480 --> 2:25:39.160]  At the end of the summer, we're looking at a late August, early September release date
[2:25:39.160 --> 2:25:43.600]  for that. I'm stoked. If you want to get to know me or a little bit more about me, you
[2:25:43.600 --> 2:25:50.160]  can go to myspace.com. I do read everything I get. I don't always respond, guys. I do
[2:25:50.160 --> 2:25:55.000]  get a lot of messages, but some of the very stories I talked about today, for instance,
[2:25:55.000 --> 2:25:59.720]  that Australian database were tips that somebody sent me over on my MySpace. I encourage you
[2:25:59.720 --> 2:26:05.080]  to go over there, check it out, and give me a little email. I do respond sometimes. Let's
[2:26:05.080 --> 2:26:10.200]  go to phone calls. Remember, I am with Jonathan Elenoff of We Are Change Colorado, somebody
[2:26:10.200 --> 2:26:14.040]  who actually made a difference, folks. Somebody who didn't say, I can't do anything. I have
[2:26:14.040 --> 2:26:18.440]  no power. He actually has incredible power, just like all of us do.
[2:26:18.440 --> 2:26:21.200]  Let's go to Chris in California. Chris, are you with us?
[2:26:21.200 --> 2:26:22.600]  Yes. How are you doing, Jason?
[2:26:22.600 --> 2:26:23.600]  Good, man. How are you doing?
[2:26:23.600 --> 2:26:29.720]  Not bad. Not bad. I was actually calling in regards to one of your previous segments
[2:26:29.720 --> 2:26:35.040]  when you were talking about health concerns and Dennis Kucinich you brought up.
[2:26:35.040 --> 2:26:40.280]  The more research I've done about this guy, the more I like him, I've actually noticed
[2:26:40.280 --> 2:26:45.320]  that in 2001, it looks like he introduced a bill to the House called the Space Preservation
[2:26:45.320 --> 2:26:50.320]  Act. I don't know if you're familiar with it, but I'm not quite familiar with it. What
[2:26:50.320 --> 2:26:52.720]  is it all against militarizing space?
[2:26:52.720 --> 2:26:59.360]  Yes. It talks about banning chemtrails, electronic psychotronic information weapons.
[2:26:59.360 --> 2:27:02.920]  I'm glad that you just mentioned chemtrails because this is something I didn't mention
[2:27:02.920 --> 2:27:08.280]  yet, but Beck, the musical artist, has a new song entitled Chemtrails. He's like,
[2:27:08.280 --> 2:27:14.360]  look up into the sky. What's going on? Where did all the people go? It's just very interesting.
[2:27:14.360 --> 2:27:16.360]  We've got a tip from that, but continue.
[2:27:16.360 --> 2:27:23.640]  I was just wondering. It's kind of odd that I've never heard anyone ask him about this
[2:27:23.640 --> 2:27:26.800]  bill that he's presented.
[2:27:26.800 --> 2:27:30.840]  I'd definitely love to engage him on it. I'm just stoked that the guy came on Alex Jones
[2:27:30.840 --> 2:27:36.920]  and said, if they let these 35 articles of impeachment just kind of wade in the water,
[2:27:36.920 --> 2:27:41.840]  they don't act on them, I'm going to stay on the floor for eight plus hours and put
[2:27:41.840 --> 2:27:46.760]  out 60-plus articles of impeachment. Now, I watched on and off because, again, this
[2:27:46.760 --> 2:27:52.360]  was over three hours, his 35 articles of impeachment. Thanks to Justin Martell of Student Scholars
[2:27:52.360 --> 2:27:55.760]  for Not Alone Truth. He let me know as soon as it started happening, I went and started
[2:27:55.760 --> 2:28:02.360]  taping it. The Cajone's on this guy. He was listing everything from illegal wiretapping
[2:28:02.360 --> 2:28:09.080]  and surveillance to 9-11, to Gitmo prisoners, to torture. He really laid it down. He's
[2:28:09.080 --> 2:28:13.560]  number one right now. He is the number one guy seeking truth in office. I still love
[2:28:13.560 --> 2:28:18.240]  Cynthia McKinney. I still love Ron Paul, but this is the guy asking the hard questions.
[2:28:18.240 --> 2:28:22.960]  He's pressing on, man. Look at Cassinage. He's not a big man of stature, yet he has incredible
[2:28:22.960 --> 2:28:26.320]  power, even though the mainstream media ignores him, Chris.
[2:28:26.320 --> 2:28:32.320]  Definitely. Actually, he was on, was it on Friday with Alex, I think?
[2:28:32.320 --> 2:28:36.440]  It was either Thursday or Friday. It was a big day for radio. It was him, Nader, others.
[2:28:36.440 --> 2:28:37.440]  It was big.
[2:28:37.440 --> 2:28:42.320]  Yeah. He was saying that he'd like to come back on next couple of weeks. I'd just like
[2:28:42.320 --> 2:28:47.600]  to maybe get someone to ask him about the Space Preservation Act, or maybe Chemtrail.
[2:28:47.600 --> 2:28:48.600]  Sure.
[2:28:48.600 --> 2:28:52.520]  You know what? I will keep that in mind and I will lay that down on the producers. Hopefully,
[2:28:52.520 --> 2:28:57.120]  you can book him. He is a tough guest to book, but we thank him for his courage. Thanks for
[2:28:57.120 --> 2:29:03.120]  the call, Chris. Let's jump to Martin in California. Martin, are you with us?
[2:29:03.120 --> 2:29:05.400]  Jonathan, how are you doing?
[2:29:05.400 --> 2:29:06.400]  Hey, how are you doing?
[2:29:06.400 --> 2:29:07.400]  Hey, what's going on?
[2:29:07.400 --> 2:29:11.000]  I heard the last part of Mark Dice's interview. Did you say that Michael Reagan is not in
[2:29:11.000 --> 2:29:12.800]  town, that he was leaving town today or something?
[2:29:12.800 --> 2:29:16.520]  Yeah. He's going out of the country. He's going to be doing his radio show, but it's
[2:29:16.520 --> 2:29:20.800]  all going to be recorded supposedly, and that's why Mark Dice was recorded. Hey, I encourage
[2:29:20.800 --> 2:29:25.160]  people to listen to it and check it out, man, because I want to see what he has to say.
[2:29:25.160 --> 2:29:29.960]  This guy should not get away with threatening us with death. Anything else, Martin?
[2:29:29.960 --> 2:29:35.520]  Yeah. I got into a clear channel today and I got in the air with the story about Mark
[2:29:35.520 --> 2:29:36.520]  Dice.
[2:29:36.520 --> 2:29:38.560]  Stay right there. We're going to come back. It's the Alex Jones show.
[2:29:38.560 --> 2:29:48.280]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:29:48.280 --> 2:29:52.360]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees. The forces of globalism are destroying national
[2:29:52.360 --> 2:29:57.440]  sovereignty worldwide, but in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope. The first time in modern
[2:29:57.440 --> 2:30:01.480]  history, the people are beginning to wake up. It is essential that patriots worldwide
[2:30:01.480 --> 2:30:05.280]  accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan. We have
[2:30:05.280 --> 2:30:09.800]  a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat. In the Info

[2:30:48.440 --> 2:30:53.840]  Listener, ask yourself, can I be deceived? Matthew 24 states four times, in the last
[2:30:53.840 --> 2:30:58.240]  days many will be deceived. There are many ideas about the mark of the beast and the
[2:30:58.240 --> 2:31:03.560]  antichrist. What do you know about the beast, its mark, and the antichrist? Is the beast
[2:31:03.560 --> 2:31:08.640]  a superpower nation or a giant computer in Belgium? Is its mark an implanted chip, a
[2:31:08.640 --> 2:31:15.360]  tattoo, the national ID card, or 666? Is the antichrist a person, title, or both? Some
[2:31:15.360 --> 2:31:20.160]  believe these things are in the future. Others believe that its in the past. First John states,
[2:31:20.160 --> 2:31:25.040]  the antichrist is already in the world. What is the truth? And what is a lie? Are you willing
[2:31:25.040 --> 2:31:30.080]  to search God's word for the truth? Friends, these answers are in the Bible. For free books,
[2:31:30.080 --> 2:31:35.160]  DVDs, and Bible studies, exposing the antichrist, the beast, and its mark, right to the Bible

[2:33:07.720 --> 2:33:13.960]  When John McCain was asked whether or not he'd be interested in Cheney and his administration,
[2:33:13.960 --> 2:33:17.360]  he said, I don't know if I would want him as a vice president. He and I have the same
[2:33:17.360 --> 2:33:23.280]  strengths, which is evil, obviously. But to serve in other capacities, hell yeah. Hell
[2:33:23.280 --> 2:33:28.760]  yeah. Oh, McCain, you're just such a puppet. It's unbelievable. We got Jonathan Elenoff
[2:33:28.760 --> 2:33:33.000]  from We Are Changed Colorado with us. And remember, they do some great things over there.
[2:33:33.000 --> 2:33:37.560]  Jonathan also posts blogs over at my little site, LooseChange911.com. And I'd like to
[2:33:37.560 --> 2:33:44.680]  encourage everybody to go to LooseChangeTheFinalCut.com and get a couple copies of the film, perhaps
[2:33:44.680 --> 2:33:49.480]  make 10 or 20 copies from that copy that you buy and hand them out. Because we are in an
[2:33:49.480 --> 2:33:54.280]  information war, especially when they're trying to arrest us for giving out that free information.
[2:33:54.280 --> 2:33:58.680]  We have Martin from California on the line. And you were saying how you got through to
[2:33:58.680 --> 2:34:02.480]  Clear Channel this morning? Yeah, well, first off, we scheduled the protest
[2:34:02.480 --> 2:34:05.800]  of Michael Ray today, but I didn't know he was going to be out of town. What do you think?
[2:34:05.800 --> 2:34:08.600]  Would you still do it, or do you think you should wait till it comes back? No, definitely
[2:34:08.600 --> 2:34:13.480]  do it, man. Go down there and make sure that they know that it's not cool to hire somebody
[2:34:13.480 --> 2:34:19.560]  who called for the murder of American citizens. And the shooting deaths of American citizens.
[2:34:19.560 --> 2:34:27.320]  Look, I rock and investigate 9-11 shirt, or a 9-11 was an inside job shirt, or question
[2:34:27.320 --> 2:34:32.280]  9-11 truth. Now, I wear that stuff two, three times a week. The last thing I need to do
[2:34:32.280 --> 2:34:36.440]  is to be walking down the street and one of Reagan's crazed listeners come up and shoot
[2:34:36.440 --> 2:34:44.440]  me. I don't need that. I don't need it for being somebody who believes in the truth,
[2:34:44.440 --> 2:34:48.200]  for expressing my free speech, for trying to spread the message. I don't need to get
[2:34:48.200 --> 2:34:52.920]  capped in the head by some crazy. And Michael Reagan, the thing about Michael
[2:34:52.920 --> 2:34:58.280]  Reagan is, we have to remember, on his site you can go and see his producer, his phone
[2:34:58.280 --> 2:35:03.160]  numbers on the site, the faxes there, all the P.O. boxes. You guys want to contact him.
[2:35:03.160 --> 2:35:07.800]  I encourage people to contact him and voice your opinion to this guy. You have to remember,
[2:35:07.800 --> 2:35:15.720]  you know, his stepfather, Ronald Reagan, launched the DEA, created the false war on drugs and
[2:35:15.720 --> 2:35:20.200]  ever-expanding prison industrial complex at the same time I ran a contract with going
[2:35:20.200 --> 2:35:25.480]  on. So we have to remember, you know, Michael Reagan's the last one to talk about treason,
[2:35:25.480 --> 2:35:31.000]  anything along the terms of traitor. His father was investigated for treason while drugs were
[2:35:31.000 --> 2:35:35.880]  being brought into this country under his years. He created the war on drugs. I mean,
[2:35:35.880 --> 2:35:40.200]  you can't get any more treasonous than that. Not only that, but this guy, listen, this guy is
[2:35:40.200 --> 2:35:45.560]  a spoiled rich kid who thinks he's above the law because he was the president's son. That's the
[2:35:45.560 --> 2:35:50.120]  bottom line. This guy feels like he's beyond reproach. I mean, that's the real deal. I guarantee
[2:35:50.120 --> 2:35:54.680]  that's how he feels. He lived a life of privilege. His father was the president. He got away with
[2:35:54.680 --> 2:35:58.680]  everything and anything he ever wanted to do. So he really thinks he has carte blanche to say
[2:35:58.680 --> 2:36:03.480]  whatever he wants. And if he calls for our murders, that's okay because he's part of the elite. At
[2:36:03.480 --> 2:36:07.880]  least he thinks he is. He's not really part of the elite. He's such a lower echelon. Yeah,
[2:36:07.880 --> 2:36:12.760]  he's a wannabe. He's a wannabe for sure, Martin. Look, go down there. I totally encourage you, man.
[2:36:12.760 --> 2:36:15.720]  And I'll let us know how it goes. Post it on YouTube. I thank you for the call.
[2:36:16.920 --> 2:36:21.160]  Let's jump. Man, we got so many California calls. Let's jump to Josh in Hollywood.
[2:36:21.160 --> 2:36:26.920]  Hollywood, California, Josh Willis. Josh, you there? I'm here. Hang on a second. All right.
[2:36:28.760 --> 2:36:32.280]  Phone issues. All right, Jonathan. Or not, Jonathan. Josh, what do you want to talk about?
[2:36:32.280 --> 2:36:36.040]  Yes. That was a quick jump, bro. How are you doing today? Good, man. Good.
[2:36:37.880 --> 2:36:43.320]  Can't hear you. Hang on. I'm having fun. All right. Oh, live radio. Are you there?
[2:36:44.680 --> 2:36:48.200]  Can you hear us? Yeah, I got you. Okay. So what do you want to talk about, Josh?
[2:36:48.200 --> 2:36:54.520]  Oh, not much. Just wanted to say good job to everybody. It's just nice to see that there's
[2:36:54.520 --> 2:36:59.880]  people out there doing stuff. And, you know, hopefully we can turn this thing around. It's
[2:36:59.880 --> 2:37:05.480]  going to take a lot of us. I'm very frustrated, actually. I'm a college student. And one of the
[2:37:06.120 --> 2:37:11.000]  topics that comes up often, no matter what class it is, whether it's philosophy or one of my
[2:37:11.000 --> 2:37:16.600]  courses for my major, there's often war on terror, preemptive attacks, and this sort of stuff.
[2:37:16.600 --> 2:37:20.440]  And some of the responses that some of the students are giving are just chilling. It's like
[2:37:20.440 --> 2:37:24.040]  they didn't pay attention in their high school civics class. They didn't pay attention in their
[2:37:24.040 --> 2:37:30.600]  high school history class. They don't understand why the government doesn't have a right to know
[2:37:31.320 --> 2:37:35.560]  what you're doing in your home, why you have a right to privacy, why you have a right to free
[2:37:35.560 --> 2:37:39.560]  speech, why you have a right to bear arms. People are afraid of weapons now rather than
[2:37:40.280 --> 2:37:44.040]  being glad that they can happen to defend themselves against people who have something else.
[2:37:44.040 --> 2:37:48.120]  Well, let me say this, man. Josh, I mean, let's be honest.
[2:37:48.120 --> 2:37:51.560]  I see people out there actually doing something about it and showing people that, hey,
[2:37:52.120 --> 2:37:54.280]  you know, this isn't right.
[2:37:54.280 --> 2:37:58.200]  Yeah, no, I'm with you there. But let's be honest. I mean, civics is dead. I mean,
[2:37:58.200 --> 2:38:01.880]  civics class, I didn't even have civics class, and I was in high school 10 years ago.
[2:38:02.440 --> 2:38:04.920]  You know, up 10 plus years ago now. I just went to my 10th anniversary.
[2:38:04.920 --> 2:38:08.280]  I thought that it was a federal requirement to have a civics class. Maybe that was a state
[2:38:08.280 --> 2:38:11.400]  requirement, but I thought the whole country was required to have a course.
[2:38:11.400 --> 2:38:15.720]  And I remember when I, well, I did take a course in government, but it wasn't called
[2:38:15.720 --> 2:38:19.720]  civics. And it was a half a semester course. And then I thought I took youth injustice,
[2:38:19.720 --> 2:38:23.960]  which was also, I guess, kind of like a civics course, but not really.
[2:38:23.960 --> 2:38:29.560]  But really, the meat of what I did take that gave me any kind of education on the Constitution,
[2:38:29.560 --> 2:38:34.600]  the Bill of Rights, the laws is that I took advanced placement history for college credit
[2:38:34.600 --> 2:38:39.400]  out of SUNY Albany in high school. And really, that's about it for me. I mean,
[2:38:39.400 --> 2:38:45.800]  maybe youth injustice, maybe government, but I mean, people just are not taught that you are
[2:38:45.800 --> 2:38:51.400]  a free human being, that they don't have the right to come in and approach you and demand
[2:38:51.400 --> 2:38:55.080]  information and things from you. That's the Fourth Amendment. We have the right to be secure
[2:38:55.080 --> 2:38:59.480]  in our persons and our property. And you don't see that anymore.
[2:38:59.480 --> 2:39:05.640]  And that's legally speaking. I mean, just as a man as a human being, nobody's got that right
[2:39:05.640 --> 2:39:10.840]  anyway. I don't need a piece of paper to tell me that I have those rights. Those rights are
[2:39:10.840 --> 2:39:14.280]  mine. And if people don't want to give me those rights, then I will take those rights for myself.
[2:39:15.400 --> 2:39:19.320]  Live for your diet says on the New Hampshire license plate. And when I was a kid, I always
[2:39:19.320 --> 2:39:23.320]  thought that was kind of, I didn't really understand it until about a few years ago.
[2:39:23.320 --> 2:39:29.000]  And now I understand what it means. And that's my attitude. And people, I don't know what the
[2:39:29.000 --> 2:39:31.640]  hell they're thinking. I mean, if you look at history and you look at what happens when you
[2:39:31.640 --> 2:39:35.960]  appease government, when you appease tyrants, or even when you appease the bully on the playground,
[2:39:35.960 --> 2:39:39.720]  I mean, because most people aren't really ahead. They're about five years ahead of a monkey
[2:39:39.720 --> 2:39:43.240]  squabble, socially speaking. I mean, let's be honest, we develop what most in our,
[2:39:43.240 --> 2:39:47.640]  in our one to five years as a child when we're one to five years old, okay? Well, we're five
[2:39:47.640 --> 2:39:51.720]  years ahead of a monkey squabble. And everything that happens in society, you can see on the
[2:39:51.720 --> 2:39:56.440]  playground. And if you really look at the society, you really understand it. And you sit there and
[2:39:56.440 --> 2:40:00.840]  you watch the Spain. You listen to these people talk. You know, they use some fancy words that
[2:40:00.840 --> 2:40:04.440]  articulation and fictions a little bit better than the guy down the street, but it's really not all
[2:40:04.440 --> 2:40:08.840]  that different. And the sooner that people wake up and realize that that it's the blindly in the
[2:40:08.840 --> 2:40:13.320]  blind, the emperor has no clothes, and it's not a conspiracy. You know, people always jump out.
[2:40:13.320 --> 2:40:18.040]  No, it's a conspiracy. It's not a conspiracy. It's the way that it is. The sun's out. You know,
[2:40:18.040 --> 2:40:21.720]  this, this, this person's doing this thing, that person's doing that thing. Human nature's the
[2:40:21.720 --> 2:40:27.080]  way that it is. And with 24 types of human nervous system, I'd say there's 24 conspiracies
[2:40:27.080 --> 2:40:34.920]  afoot of anyone. Well, I'm with you. I'm with you 110%. I hope everybody keeps up the good work.
[2:40:35.480 --> 2:40:39.160]  And I hope that we can all somehow coordinate this because we're all kind of working on
[2:40:39.160 --> 2:40:42.760]  different things and we're all kind of hitting different angles. And I just hope that we can
[2:40:42.760 --> 2:40:46.360]  all come together and make this great again. All right, man, I thank you for the call, Josh.
[2:40:46.360 --> 2:40:52.120]  I'm with them. I mean, I hope that we can gear up and organize. I worry about centralization
[2:40:52.120 --> 2:40:57.080]  because, you know, once you do that, you make it a lot easier to infiltrate Jonathan. You make
[2:40:57.080 --> 2:41:02.600]  it a lot easier for some time, some type of a Cointel Pro operation to be a little bit more
[2:41:02.600 --> 2:41:08.120]  effective. But at some point, we will have to organize all these groups together, all the
[2:41:08.120 --> 2:41:13.000]  great groups, the groups like We Are Changed, the groups like TruthAction.org, the groups like
[2:41:13.000 --> 2:41:17.640]  Student Scholars for 9-11 Truth, you know, Veterans for 9-11 Truth, people that are really
[2:41:17.640 --> 2:41:23.400]  concerned. Go ahead. We do have a temporary system that Jason and I, Jason Charles of
[2:41:23.400 --> 2:41:29.080]  our Truth Alliance, you know, are trying to promote, which is over at TruthAction.net,
[2:41:29.080 --> 2:41:34.200]  we have a new feature that they paid for and built out under their profiles. And what we're
[2:41:34.200 --> 2:41:40.280]  trying to do is give people to sign up, create a little profile, just like Facebook or MySpace
[2:41:40.280 --> 2:41:44.200]  or anything like that, except for this is for the truth or movement. And basically,
[2:41:44.200 --> 2:41:48.920]  we're going to create newsletters and We Are Changed, it's 9-11 Truth, it's Info Warriors.
[2:41:49.480 --> 2:41:53.560]  We only got about 170 members so far. And by the way, there's also another social
[2:41:53.560 --> 2:41:58.040]  networking thing out there with LoneLantern.org and Gary Franchi. In fact, I should get a hold
[2:41:58.040 --> 2:42:02.840]  of him because he put that together and I haven't really checked it out. And LoneLantern.org is
[2:42:02.840 --> 2:42:08.600]  really another one of those organizations that is out on the forefront. And folks, I mean, please
[2:42:08.600 --> 2:42:16.040]  go to PrisonPlanet.com, go to InfoWars.com, find the most hard-hitting articles and then send
[2:42:16.040 --> 2:42:21.720]  them to 15 or 20 friends. I mean, there's 15 hard-hitting articles on those sites daily.
[2:42:22.440 --> 2:42:26.760]  Or get the DVDs, order the DVDs. I tell people, you know, some of the best stuff. You know,
[2:42:26.760 --> 2:42:32.440]  when I saw Terror Storm, I'm not going to lie to you, I didn't know anything about what went on
[2:42:32.440 --> 2:42:39.080]  in the 7-7 Amings in London. I knew nothing. And Alex Jones opened me up to a whole world
[2:42:39.080 --> 2:42:44.600]  of the history of false flag terrorism. And it changed my life forever. And everyone I've
[2:42:44.600 --> 2:42:49.480]  ever handed in a Terror Storm too, same thing. I've never had a negative response from that.
[2:42:49.480 --> 2:42:54.040]  Everyone wakes up immediately. And what's really interesting with the older generations is you
[2:42:54.040 --> 2:42:58.680]  get people to come back and tell you, oh yeah, you know, this is just another chapter in a long
[2:42:58.680 --> 2:43:03.000]  history of treason that these guys have been doing. They were involved in Kennedy, they were
[2:43:03.000 --> 2:43:08.760]  at Watergate, Iran, Contra. Some of them know about Gladio. I mean, yeah. It's crazy. Yeah,
[2:43:08.760 --> 2:43:12.600]  it is crazy. But that's how we have to do it. Let's take some more calls, Jonathan. Let's go
[2:43:12.600 --> 2:43:18.200]  to Rob in Minnesota. Rob, are you with us? Hi, Jason. How are you doing? Good, man. How are you
[2:43:18.200 --> 2:43:24.120]  doing? I'm pretty good. I was kind of calling in a little off topic of what the other callers
[2:43:24.120 --> 2:43:29.880]  were talking about. Sure. But I have, you know, how the state and how it kind of starts in schools.
[2:43:30.680 --> 2:43:35.880]  I'm sorry. Can you repeat that? Kind of like how the police state is really starting in like,
[2:43:35.880 --> 2:43:41.160]  in schools now. And you're talking about really grade schools, you know, kindergarten through
[2:43:41.160 --> 2:43:46.920]  12. Just like I just said, in Australia, they literally have a database of every student and
[2:43:46.920 --> 2:43:53.240]  their goals, their career opportunities, their grades. We have cameras going up in all these
[2:43:53.240 --> 2:43:57.640]  schools. And, you know, they also run a lot of drills. I mean, you sound like a young guy.
[2:43:57.640 --> 2:44:03.560]  What are you in high school right now? I'm going into sophomore year. I recently posted this
[2:44:03.560 --> 2:44:13.080]  video on YouTube because I was just simply talking and I was then written up for what was,
[2:44:13.080 --> 2:44:18.600]  they cited as disrespect. So then I asked them why I was being written up and it was a simple
[2:44:18.600 --> 2:44:24.440]  question of authority and they called the police in. Oh, wait, wait, you, you are my space me,
[2:44:24.440 --> 2:44:29.560]  right? You're my space. Yeah, I mean, it's incredible to me that they would call the police
[2:44:29.560 --> 2:44:34.600]  on a student for speaking up, but not really. I mean, I got to tell you, even when I was in school,
[2:44:34.600 --> 2:44:39.480]  we had these all of a sudden code red, code red would come out over the loudspeakers. They
[2:44:39.480 --> 2:44:45.800]  literally locked down the, and this is a small school, man. I graduated with 55 people. Okay.
[2:44:45.800 --> 2:44:49.720]  My entire high school had about 300 people and they locked down the rooms. They brought in the
[2:44:49.720 --> 2:44:55.240]  drug sniffing dogs and they parade around as our saviors. You know, total police state and you're
[2:44:55.240 --> 2:44:59.880]  right. You don't have free speech anymore in this country, especially in a classroom. If you look
[2:44:59.880 --> 2:45:04.760]  what happened to that Japanese teacher recently, you know, he talked about 9-11 being an inside
[2:45:04.760 --> 2:45:09.480]  job with his students and he was forced to make a public apology to the PTA. Now you were written
[2:45:09.480 --> 2:45:13.560]  up, the police come in, explain it to me. What do the police even say to you at this point? What
[2:45:13.560 --> 2:45:16.520]  do they do? They take you down to the office like you're the bad guy and interrogate you?
[2:45:17.720 --> 2:45:22.680]  It was about 320 and school gets out at 318. I've already got all my school supplies and I'm
[2:45:22.680 --> 2:45:29.160]  already right next to the exit and here comes a police officer with one of the school officials
[2:45:29.160 --> 2:45:35.560]  and they come, she comes up to me and she goes, you're going to have to come with me now. And I
[2:45:35.560 --> 2:45:42.360]  just simply ask the simple questions. What, what am I being detained for? Am I free to go?
[2:45:42.360 --> 2:45:49.480]  What do I do? She didn't answer them. And then I said, why are you detaining me? She didn't
[2:45:49.480 --> 2:45:53.560]  answer them. She just told me, if you don't come with me, I'm going to put handcuffs.
[2:45:54.600 --> 2:45:59.960]  So where does this go? I mean, did your parents come down? Did they charge you with anything?
[2:45:59.960 --> 2:46:03.320]  Did they try to write you a ticket or did they just kind of really try to scare you? Because
[2:46:03.320 --> 2:46:06.280]  that's their thing. They want to make you fear them. They're the authority.
[2:46:06.280 --> 2:46:11.880]  Mostly, mostly scare tactics because they held me in there for about an hour trying to tell me,
[2:46:11.880 --> 2:46:16.520]  you know, like, you're not going to go anywhere with this. You're nothing, you're not getting
[2:46:16.520 --> 2:46:20.520]  anything accomplished with this. They didn't contact my parents if it weren't for a friend telling
[2:46:20.520 --> 2:46:25.720]  my parents they wouldn't be there. They're trying to use scare tactics to get me. They wanted,
[2:46:25.720 --> 2:46:30.280]  they basically wanted to get me to, you know, they want you to give up your civil liberties once
[2:46:30.280 --> 2:46:37.080]  you come into school. Bow down, bow down before your leaders. I'm hoping your parents, you know,
[2:46:37.080 --> 2:46:42.440]  filed a complaint, said they don't like this, called the administrator, called the principal,
[2:46:42.440 --> 2:46:47.480]  didn't know something. Do your parents not just get it? Do they get it yet? You're a young guy,
[2:46:47.480 --> 2:46:53.240]  you seem to get it. They don't get it through that. No, my parents definitely get it. Actually,
[2:46:53.240 --> 2:46:59.960]  I got in contact with Luka Delsky recently and he, my parents are going to call him up and we're
[2:46:59.960 --> 2:47:03.960]  trying to work on something like kind of like flooding the phone lines in because, you know,
[2:47:03.960 --> 2:47:08.200]  there's really, they need to just get the message that they can't keep doing this, whether it's
[2:47:08.200 --> 2:47:13.800]  over now, but, you know, they just cannot keep instilling the police state. So, it's not over,
[2:47:13.800 --> 2:47:17.080]  buddy. You know what? If we want our freedom, it's never going to be over. We're going to have to
[2:47:17.080 --> 2:47:20.520]  fight this tyranny. We're going to have to press on. I love what you're doing, man. I hope that
[2:47:20.520 --> 2:47:24.680]  Luka can help you out. He's a good person to get in touch with. God bless you and your parents.
[2:47:24.680 --> 2:47:28.200]  Rob, I thank you for the call. Check in with me on MySpace. I'm going to be hosting all week.
[2:47:28.200 --> 2:47:33.240]  Any developments, we'll have you on for a 15-minute segment. We should really get him on anyway.
[2:47:33.240 --> 2:47:38.760]  All right. Let's jump to another caller. Let's jump to Joe in Pennsylvania. Joe, are you with us?
[2:47:38.760 --> 2:47:41.320]  Yeah. How are you doing there, guys? Good, man. How are you doing?
[2:47:41.320 --> 2:47:49.160]  I'm doing all right. I got a few subjects that I've been wanting to talk about. First, Friday,
[2:47:49.160 --> 2:47:56.280]  when I was listening to that thing about Mike Reagan, first thing I did was call his radio show.
[2:47:57.080 --> 2:48:01.000]  Got the answering machine, of course, and I said, you're going to need more than one bullet. I said,
[2:48:01.000 --> 2:48:05.240]  you're going to need millions. I said, you got one mark with my name on it because there's a lot
[2:48:05.240 --> 2:48:11.240]  of us out here. But anyway, Mike Reagan has no idea of what he's doing. He's drawing a line in a
[2:48:11.240 --> 2:48:18.040]  sand, and he cannot fight a battle, but he has no idea who's on the other side. There are so many
[2:48:18.040 --> 2:48:22.040]  people in this movement that will pursue him now legally. He's going to be harassed the rest of his
[2:48:22.040 --> 2:48:28.200]  life for saying that. He's the last open to talk about treason. He kicked us open the teeth.
[2:48:28.760 --> 2:48:33.160]  No, I agree. He doesn't even know what he's opened. It hasn't even been a week on yet that he said
[2:48:33.160 --> 2:48:37.400]  these things. When it is a week on, he's going to start feeling it. A month on, he's really going
[2:48:37.400 --> 2:48:42.360]  to start feeling it. If we do this thing right a year from now, when he's in court, he's really
[2:48:42.360 --> 2:48:46.280]  going to feel it. He's going to feel it in the place that affects a guy like him the most in his
[2:48:46.280 --> 2:48:54.760]  wallet. Another thing, I don't know if you guys saw this or not. It was a piece on MSNBC. You were
[2:48:54.760 --> 2:48:58.680]  talking about their monitoring the food we eat and all that. Tell us what we can eat and what we
[2:48:58.680 --> 2:49:05.640]  can't. Over in Japan, the government... Yes, I did see this. It's a 34-inch waistline.
[2:49:09.400 --> 2:49:14.840]  It's actually unreal. You can't have a 34-inch waistline in Japan. What they're going to do is
[2:49:14.840 --> 2:49:21.560]  they're going to measure it. If you're over 33.5 inches, well, you're going to be put on a diet
[2:49:21.560 --> 2:49:25.720]  and they're going to inspect you. You're going to have a little time to lose the weight, but if
[2:49:25.720 --> 2:49:30.440]  you don't lose the weight, what is it like? You're going to be arrested, right? You literally go to
[2:49:30.440 --> 2:49:34.920]  jail for being fat in that country now. I read where it's six months and then they'll start giving
[2:49:34.920 --> 2:49:40.520]  you financial penalties. Listen, you can't make this stuff up. They're now trying to penalize
[2:49:40.520 --> 2:49:45.720]  people for being overweight. Total police state, total control. They'd love to have it here in
[2:49:45.720 --> 2:49:53.560]  America. They'd love it. There was just one more thing and that was Army Regulation 210-35.
[2:49:54.120 --> 2:49:59.400]  It was something Alex was talking about, about the prison inmate labor and the civilian inmate
[2:49:59.400 --> 2:50:05.560]  labor. If you Google that, Army Regulation 210-35. Yeah, that means if you're in a wheelchair,
[2:50:05.560 --> 2:50:10.840]  you still have to work for them, right? Well, I am in a wheelchair. I'm a quadriplegic. Oh my
[2:50:10.840 --> 2:50:18.760]  God. But anyway, you've got a civilian inmate labor and they're supposedly going to use the
[2:50:18.760 --> 2:50:25.160]  nonviolent criminals, but it literally says they don't get paid. You have to work. They work for
[2:50:25.160 --> 2:50:32.200]  them on another subject. Hold on, Joe. Actually, hold over. We'll talk about that last subject
[2:50:32.200 --> 2:50:35.800]  on the other side. It's the Alex Jones show. That's right, folks. They're enslaving you
[2:50:35.800 --> 2:50:36.760]  through private prisons.
[2:50:48.440 --> 2:50:52.680]  Do you stay up late worrying about your teen driver? Do you need to know the exact location

[2:53:47.320 --> 2:54:04.440]  Everybody knows that the days are loaded. Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed.
[2:54:04.440 --> 2:54:17.640]  Everybody knows the war is over. Everybody knows the good guys lost. Everybody knows the fight was
[2:54:17.640 --> 2:54:27.480]  fixed. The poor stay poor. The rich get rich. That is how it goes. Unless you're ready to man up,
[2:54:27.480 --> 2:54:33.080]  take on the system. You know, the fact that they're actually going to regulate what people can eat
[2:54:33.080 --> 2:54:37.480]  in another country reminds me of that sci-fi movie, The Island, where they got all these clones.
[2:54:37.480 --> 2:54:41.800]  They don't know their clones. They're basically going to be there to have their organs harvested.
[2:54:41.800 --> 2:54:46.600]  Another lovely thing that goes on over in China. Anyway, they're there as backups for their actual
[2:54:46.600 --> 2:54:53.000]  people to have their organs. Organs basically harvested. They're nothing but cattle to these
[2:54:53.000 --> 2:54:59.320]  people. The real interesting thing about it is that they don't know it, but they're being regulated.
[2:54:59.320 --> 2:55:03.720]  They have to go to the bathroom every day and they figure out what they're allowed to eat.
[2:55:03.720 --> 2:55:06.920]  And this guy's upset because he can't eat bacon. He can't eat this. And basically,
[2:55:06.920 --> 2:55:12.760]  they're doing that to make you like a breed of a dog, to tell you what you can and can't have,
[2:55:12.760 --> 2:55:17.080]  to control you further. And I'm so glad that Joe in Pennsylvania brought that up. Really good points
[2:55:17.080 --> 2:55:21.320]  you're bringing up, Joe. So why don't you bring up that final point with us? The final point you
[2:55:21.320 --> 2:55:27.000]  had to do with it was a caller that I had called before. And I was just curious. I was on another
[2:55:27.000 --> 2:55:34.280]  radio talk show host, our talk show. And you know, they had all these illegal immigrants
[2:55:34.280 --> 2:55:40.840]  out doing their march, half a million of them. And they had a, you know, black people did a million
[2:55:40.840 --> 2:55:47.560]  man march. And I was just curious, our greatest, you know, to protect ourselves, you know, you
[2:55:47.560 --> 2:55:51.880]  guys have a lot of great groups. And I love Alex Jones. But if they're naive enough to think if
[2:55:51.880 --> 2:55:55.880]  they silence him, they're going to silence the movement. That's very naive. But my question
[2:55:55.880 --> 2:56:00.040]  is this. And now I'm going to get off the phone after this, so you guys can talk about it. What
[2:56:00.040 --> 2:56:07.160]  are the chances of just uniting us for a little while to make a huge march on Washington? Well,
[2:56:07.160 --> 2:56:13.080]  I got to tell you that the best shot we got right now is Ron Paul. And you mentioned the
[2:56:13.080 --> 2:56:17.400]  millions, million man march or the million more march, million more march happened a couple years
[2:56:17.400 --> 2:56:23.000]  ago. And Farrakhan organized those things. Now, love him or hate him. Lewis Farrakhan knows about
[2:56:23.000 --> 2:56:29.240]  9 11. He's gone public about it. He knows about the power structure. He openly says that the real
[2:56:29.240 --> 2:56:34.680]  ruler of this planet is Satan. Okay. And love him or hate him. I think he's got a lot of good
[2:56:34.680 --> 2:56:39.320]  things today. I'm sorry, good things to say and love him or hate him. He's one of the few guys
[2:56:39.320 --> 2:56:44.360]  that can get millions of people out in force. Well, like Alex said, let's drop our color,
[2:56:44.360 --> 2:56:51.560]  our religion, our race, our creed, whatever, and just unite under that one banner of freedom
[2:56:51.560 --> 2:56:57.560]  and truth. I agree, man. I agree totally. And I hope we can do it. I hope that thing is a success
[2:56:57.560 --> 2:57:02.200]  this summer. I know Ron Paul is now doing another convention, but you know what? I'm going to try
[2:57:02.200 --> 2:57:06.280]  to get in touch with Farrakhan. I've been in touch with his people before and maybe he is the guy,
[2:57:06.280 --> 2:57:11.080]  you know, because it's by any means necessary to me, Joe, to get us out there, to let people know
[2:57:11.080 --> 2:57:16.280]  there are millions of us that we want change, that we know about 9 11 and we want our Constitution
[2:57:16.280 --> 2:57:21.960]  and Billerites back. You're doing a great work and I'm praying for all of you. All right. Thank you,
[2:57:21.960 --> 2:57:26.840]  Joe. What's your take on that, Jonathan? I mean, it's pretty much by any means necessary as long
[2:57:26.840 --> 2:57:32.200]  as we are peaceful about it, correct? Yeah. I mean, you know, the funny thing about China economy is
[2:57:32.200 --> 2:57:39.720]  China is a push, of course, remember, made them most favorite nation in 2002. And that was still
[2:57:39.720 --> 2:57:44.680]  during the time that they had the one child policy and they were killing, you know, female babies
[2:57:44.680 --> 2:57:48.840]  and all kinds of things. And we still have the struggle with Tibet and Burma. Well, that's what
[2:57:48.840 --> 2:57:53.800]  they want here. I mean, that's the whole implementation of this green movement and this carbon tax.
[2:57:53.800 --> 2:57:58.360]  It's to make you feel bad for living your life, for having a family, for having two cars, for
[2:57:58.360 --> 2:58:03.400]  having a big house. We're the culprits, folks. Listen, we're going to take your calls in the
[2:58:03.400 --> 2:58:09.160]  final hour. I want to let everybody know. Live streaming video over at prisonplanet.tv.

[3:00:03.640 --> 3:00:08.760]  prisonplanet.tv. For all you subscribers out there, I love how it gets out on YouTube. I love how
[3:00:08.760 --> 3:00:14.760]  you spread the word. It encourages me. It lets me know that this info war will not be fought in vain.
[3:00:14.760 --> 3:00:23.480]  That we can take on these tyrants. That although the world we live in is ruled by evil, that does
[3:00:23.480 --> 3:00:30.200]  not stop us from doing good. You know, no matter how many lies, manipulative disinformation they
[3:00:30.200 --> 3:00:35.080]  put out there, there are going to be people like you and me folks that aren't going to stand for it,
[3:00:35.080 --> 3:00:38.120]  that are going to educate the masses, that are going to tell our friends and family,
[3:00:38.120 --> 3:00:45.400]  that are going to try to stop this system of corruption, of greed, of decadence, and of death.
[3:00:46.440 --> 3:00:47.240]  And that's what it is.
[3:00:50.280 --> 3:00:53.560]  So that being said, I'm just going to go through your calls for this hour. If you got something
[3:00:53.560 --> 3:00:59.240]  to say, now's the time to say it. Let's go to Dave in California, yet another California call. Dave,
[3:00:59.240 --> 3:01:08.920]  you're with us.
[3:01:10.680 --> 3:01:16.360]  Yeah, I got a couple things for you, Jason. First, big hi and thank you, and God bless you,
[3:01:16.360 --> 3:01:21.240]  and good job to all the We Are Change folks out there, including Denver, including Ireland,
[3:01:21.240 --> 3:01:26.920]  including the folks that were at Chantilly, and took down the Bilderbergs and made them look stupid
[3:01:26.920 --> 3:01:33.000]  and powerless and weak and ridiculous like they are, a bunch of hoarding little pukes.
[3:01:34.440 --> 3:01:39.160]  Oh, and I got two pieces of really good news for you. One, we've had a whole week of clear blue,
[3:01:39.160 --> 3:01:45.400]  high blue sky, no cam trails whatsoever, and I'm really attuned to this. And secondly,
[3:01:47.320 --> 3:01:51.000]  speaking of getting DVDs out to the troops and information out to the troops,
[3:01:51.000 --> 3:01:58.760]  as soon as I heard this Michael Reagan and what he had to say about us and our people,
[3:01:59.320 --> 3:02:08.840]  I called his offices and gave him my PO box and demanded a response in writing to my charge
[3:02:08.840 --> 3:02:14.840]  that what he had done was criminal and needed to be addressed. And if anybody in this organization
[3:02:14.840 --> 3:02:18.840]  is hurt as a result of it, that we're going to not only hold Michael Reagan responsible,
[3:02:18.840 --> 3:02:23.080]  we're going to hold the radio station and all the managers and everybody else personally liable.
[3:02:24.200 --> 3:02:29.320]  Also, and this is just totally out the subject, but you guys are going to love it.
[3:02:29.320 --> 3:02:37.320]  I know Alex is a Jimi Hendrix fan. I have a friend who just found a couple DVDs with 300
[3:02:37.320 --> 3:02:44.440]  unpublished Hendrix songs and all kinds of stuff, and also a really nice DVD of him.
[3:02:44.440 --> 3:02:49.960]  So I'm sending that stuff out to you guys right away. There might be some good bumper stuff in
[3:02:49.960 --> 3:02:54.760]  there, but at least you'll enjoy it and feel free to copy and spread it out. Excellent,
[3:02:54.760 --> 3:02:58.680]  man. I thank you so much for that. And yeah, man, if anything does happen to any of us,
[3:02:58.680 --> 3:03:03.240]  I hope that we double triple quadruple our efforts. And I hope that people are going to double and
[3:03:03.240 --> 3:03:08.200]  triple quadruple their efforts today after Mark Dice came on and explained that, yes,
[3:03:08.200 --> 3:03:12.680]  he was allowed on his radio show. It was a prerecorded interview. They're going to edit it
[3:03:12.680 --> 3:03:18.040]  any way they like. And Reagan's taken off out of the country. He feels the heat. I guarantee it.
[3:03:18.040 --> 3:03:22.520]  I guarantee people got a hold of his phone number. They called his house. He doesn't feel so comfortable
[3:03:22.520 --> 3:03:27.560]  anymore. He doesn't feel like the spoiled rich kid he was raised at. He's a real telephone tough guy.
[3:03:27.560 --> 3:03:31.720]  That's what I like to call these people. Telephone tough guys. They'll say whatever they want behind
[3:03:31.720 --> 3:03:35.960]  a microphone or behind a phone, but face to face. Tell me you're going to shoot me in the head,
[3:03:35.960 --> 3:03:41.000]  Michael Reagan. Get two feet from me and pull a gun. Let's see what happens. I thank you for the call,
[3:03:41.000 --> 3:03:46.200]  man. Let's keep pushing forward. Let's go to Tyler in Washington. Tyler, are you with us?
[3:03:47.080 --> 3:03:55.320]  Yeah, I'm here. Jason, thanks. I wanted to talk a little bit about this prison break over there
[3:03:55.320 --> 3:04:01.240]  in Kandahar. Yeah, absolutely. A thousand people gone. 400 of them Taliban. Now, isn't it just so
[3:04:01.240 --> 3:04:06.280]  convenient that whenever they want to break out these dangerous tourists, the tourists that are
[3:04:06.280 --> 3:04:11.480]  going to get us, we can't ever secure the actual terrorists, only goat farmers. So they constantly
[3:04:11.480 --> 3:04:16.280]  are attacking us. Go ahead. Yeah, no, I mean, you're exactly right. And, you know, and they won't
[3:04:16.280 --> 3:04:21.880]  give you the right statistics. You know, I finally looked it up and there was a 1,059 prisoners.
[3:04:21.880 --> 3:04:25.320]  All right, hold on. We're going to talk about this on the other side because it's really important
[3:04:25.320 --> 3:04:30.200]  because today they're reporting that in Afghanistan, the Taliban's taken over again. Gee, I wonder if
[3:04:30.200 --> 3:04:34.760]  it has anything to do with all those Taliban that escaped. Sounds like a script to me. I'm Jason

[3:07:50.280 --> 3:08:00.360]  because there's a war on for your mind. We live in a country that is the number one superpower
[3:08:00.360 --> 3:08:08.440]  militarily in the world, but somehow we can't get a handle on a few hundred under a thousand
[3:08:08.440 --> 3:08:14.920]  Taliban members that are now wreaking havoc in Afghanistan, a war of aggression that we started
[3:08:14.920 --> 3:08:20.680]  almost seven years ago. We still can't get a handle on that country due to a ragtag group of people
[3:08:20.680 --> 3:08:26.600]  who literally have no equipment folks and aren't even in the thousands. We're talking to Charles
[3:08:26.600 --> 3:08:32.120]  in I'm sorry Tyler in Washington about it and it's just it's mind-blowing that they still
[3:08:32.120 --> 3:08:37.800]  keep pulling the same enemies and not even in any significant numbers Tyler. That's right you know
[3:08:37.800 --> 3:08:45.080]  it sure reminds me of the of those the two British agents that were bomb and stuff and got caught
[3:08:45.080 --> 3:08:50.360]  and all of a sudden they got broke out of well before before the British MPs could even get there
[3:08:50.360 --> 3:08:55.160]  to break them out of the prison the heads of the prison already knew to let them go. I mean they
[3:08:55.160 --> 3:08:59.560]  knew right away they're like look uh we don't want to get in trouble here uh obviously these guys
[3:08:59.560 --> 3:09:03.800]  are military and they were you know part of some covert action it doesn't matter that they were
[3:09:03.800 --> 3:09:08.200]  blowing up mosques you know women and children that's cool as long as they're military they get a
[3:09:08.200 --> 3:09:13.800]  get away with it they've got a pass they're above the law. Yep I had to read about it before it even
[3:09:13.800 --> 3:09:19.720]  would make it to the you know the little media loop that they run you know with the nude bicyclists
[3:09:19.720 --> 3:09:25.880]  and all that stuff but you know a thousand people are broken out of a prison well actually it was
[3:09:25.880 --> 3:09:32.840]  suppose they say 870 and I did the math and it was 892 so I mean there should be an exact number
[3:09:32.840 --> 3:09:37.800]  if these are dangerous criminals you know that 22 they're missing if 22 people broke out of a
[3:09:37.800 --> 3:09:41.720]  federal penitentiary here you know that's all you would hear about you know. Listen the bottom line
[3:09:41.720 --> 3:09:46.600]  is if they were any kind of danger to any part of our national security apparatus to any part
[3:09:46.600 --> 3:09:51.080]  of the United States of America they would be detained somewhere where they wouldn't be getting
[3:09:51.080 --> 3:09:57.320]  out they would be under armed US guard okay this is a show this is something to put out fear and
[3:09:57.320 --> 3:10:02.360]  say look the Taliban's back we got to stay in Afghanistan we might not even need to deploy
[3:10:02.360 --> 3:10:07.000]  more troops to Afghanistan in fact maybe Afghanistan's going to be the focus instead of Iraq for a
[3:10:07.000 --> 3:10:12.520]  little while while they gear up uh towards a war with Iran Tyler I thank you for the call let's jump
[3:10:12.520 --> 3:10:18.520]  to the next caller let's go to Eric in Wisconsin Eric are you with us hey how's it going Jason good
[3:10:18.520 --> 3:10:24.600]  man how you doing I'm breathing breathing all right say listen um I hear the question constantly
[3:10:24.600 --> 3:10:28.360]  you know I talked to a lot of people and I've passed out some videos and whatnot and you know
[3:10:28.360 --> 3:10:32.600]  the attitude across the board is pretty much yeah we know the government's messed up but well what
[3:10:32.600 --> 3:10:37.720]  do you do about it and um you know I thought about it I can't sleep at night and I've come up with a
[3:10:37.720 --> 3:10:43.960]  plan you know I think about the economy I think about the political state in our country and it
[3:10:43.960 --> 3:10:51.640]  really boils down to personal independence you know you a chain is only as strong as the weakest link
[3:10:52.200 --> 3:10:57.160]  and if every single one of us could follow a plan to kind of get our own cell our own lives in in
[3:10:57.160 --> 3:11:04.600]  order as far as like getting out of debt maybe running for public office you know we're so dependent
[3:11:04.600 --> 3:11:10.440]  on the system and when the system fails everything fails well I'm with you there and the problem is
[3:11:10.440 --> 3:11:15.160]  that we have grown up in such a consumerist culture the average family ain't getting out of debt you
[3:11:15.160 --> 3:11:19.720]  know they got $40,000 in debt just in their car alone a couple hundred thousand dollars in debt
[3:11:19.720 --> 3:11:24.520]  in their home okay they don't really own anything in their house because it's bought on credit and
[3:11:24.520 --> 3:11:29.240]  you know they've probably got you know somewhere between 10 to 30 thousand dollars in the bank
[3:11:29.240 --> 3:11:35.880]  for all that debt now the dollar's been totally devalued I I agree with your point that they need
[3:11:35.880 --> 3:11:42.520]  to run for local office I really see that as the only way that we're going to be able to take this
[3:11:42.520 --> 3:11:48.840]  Leviathan on if we have uh city council members if we have state senators if we have people that
[3:11:48.840 --> 3:11:53.000]  are running for con congress in their district okay that's why I like what Ron Paul's doing with
[3:11:53.000 --> 3:11:57.880]  this campaign for liberty.org hopefully they're serious hopefully they are going to get people
[3:11:57.880 --> 3:12:01.080]  who believe in the constitution and the bill of rights in the local government because that's
[3:12:01.080 --> 3:12:05.560]  the first place we need to infiltrate Eric. Oh absolutely you know and independence is just that
[3:12:06.200 --> 3:12:10.360]  um for for every debt that we have for you know for electricity bill or phone bill everything
[3:12:10.360 --> 3:12:15.400]  each one of those is like an arm being tied down and you know how many people even grow gardens
[3:12:15.400 --> 3:12:20.920]  anymore I mean it boils down to every single part of your life that you could have control over
[3:12:20.920 --> 3:12:27.960]  we're relinquishing that that control for a false sense of security. No absolutely and look at how
[3:12:27.960 --> 3:12:33.160]  much our look how much our energy bills have gone up in the past you know seven or eight years since
[3:12:33.160 --> 3:12:37.880]  9-11 I mean ever since we put that into the hands of Enron you've just seen a doubling and tripling
[3:12:37.880 --> 3:12:44.600]  of how much electricity costs how much gas costs we already know that oil is up to an unprecedented
[3:12:44.600 --> 3:12:48.520]  rate where we're going to start paying five dollars for a gallon of gasoline in this country
[3:12:48.520 --> 3:12:52.920]  and that's going to be the norm and people have been prepped for that you know they span it out
[3:12:52.920 --> 3:12:58.280]  over a few years so that instead of total outrage of jumping from a dollar fifty to five dollars
[3:12:58.280 --> 3:13:03.400]  they jump to a dollar fifty to two to two twenty five brought it down to below two and then it's
[3:13:03.400 --> 3:13:07.640]  up to three and now it's up to almost four but they'll bring it down below three and then it'll
[3:13:07.640 --> 3:13:12.200]  be three fifty on the regular and now it's four dollars on the regular and you watch by the end
[3:13:12.200 --> 3:13:16.920]  of the summer most of us are going to be paying five dollars for a gallon of gasoline and they've
[3:13:16.920 --> 3:13:21.080]  quelched most of the dissent by doing it incrementally people are just not upset they're just not
[3:13:21.080 --> 3:13:25.240]  awake man they're drinking the fluoridated water they're watching seven hours of television
[3:13:25.240 --> 3:13:29.480]  they're more concerned with Britney Spears and Paris Hilton and they've got to drop it man they
[3:13:29.480 --> 3:13:33.720]  need to wake up they got to realize if they want a constitution and bill of rights if they want a
[3:13:33.720 --> 3:13:38.120]  government for and by the people they're going to need to become that government error I couldn't
[3:13:38.120 --> 3:13:43.800]  disagree more I mean couldn't agree more and uh so yeah get out of debt and these large corporations
[3:13:43.800 --> 3:13:48.520]  they they calculate every single penny they spend they know where it's going and what it's going to
[3:13:48.520 --> 3:13:53.160]  we don't do that we just splurge and you know we go out to eat we buy things we don't need you know
[3:13:53.160 --> 3:13:57.480]  you don't need a brand new car you could buy a you know a used car for a few thousand dollars
[3:13:57.480 --> 3:14:02.040]  and have it paid for and not have that debt hanging over your head absolutely man I thank you for
[3:14:02.040 --> 3:14:07.000]  the call let's jump to yet another caller let's go to Charles in Ohio Charles are you with us
[3:14:07.000 --> 3:14:12.200]  oh yes I am I appreciate a chance to talk to you in your audience thank you and I appreciate the
[3:14:12.200 --> 3:14:17.320]  work you do too well thank you man I just have a well short comment I want to I think there's
[3:14:18.120 --> 3:14:22.440]  a few things people ought to know we got an election coming up and there ought to be questions
[3:14:22.440 --> 3:14:30.040]  in everybody's mind concerning like the global carbon tax and fuel prices I've done my own research
[3:14:30.040 --> 3:14:35.320]  and I think people should know that a common 4,000 pound car is capable of getting 80 miles to
[3:14:35.320 --> 3:14:41.080]  their gallon on straight gasoline if the government really cared about fuel prices they couldn't mix
[3:14:41.080 --> 3:14:50.360]  our gasoline now with 50% water 50% gasoline and a common car can be converted to run off of water
[3:14:50.360 --> 3:14:58.920]  and uh if if they cared about pollution our cars now we currently have technology these things are
[3:14:58.920 --> 3:15:04.840]  facts they're not fantasy they can be backed up a common car can be run closed loop that's where
[3:15:04.840 --> 3:15:11.400]  the exhaust gas goes back into the intake these would drastically increase the efficiency of
[3:15:11.400 --> 3:15:16.840]  automobile and improve the miles per gallon and these are like I say it's not these are history
[3:15:16.840 --> 3:15:21.960]  they're not fantasy well absolutely I mean if you look at it this is about supply and demand and
[3:15:21.960 --> 3:15:26.440]  they control the supply of oil now so they can demand what they want they have no interest
[3:15:26.440 --> 3:15:30.840]  in pushing these technologies I mean look at the electric car I watched who killed the electric car
[3:15:30.840 --> 3:15:35.240]  there's no doubt in my mind that that thing could have been improved upon and they made it so that
[3:15:35.240 --> 3:15:39.560]  people who bought that car could only lease it and they took it back okay if you look at you
[3:15:39.560 --> 3:15:45.080]  know the fuel cell uh research that's old school that's very old I mean fuel cells are are kind of
[3:15:45.080 --> 3:15:51.560]  a joke if you go and google online uh I believe it's salt water uh burns you'll see how this man
[3:15:51.560 --> 3:15:56.920]  has converted uh salt water to energy uh he put it through a certain frequency they're doing tests
[3:15:56.920 --> 3:16:03.800]  on it but he converted his car to run mostly on water that's true uh the government has no interest
[3:16:03.800 --> 3:16:10.040]  in free energy for you and I because uh controlling how much power we're allowed uh the heat of our
[3:16:10.040 --> 3:16:15.960]  homes uh the amount we can travel in our car is beneficial to them because we constantly are paying
[3:16:15.960 --> 3:16:21.960]  our you know criminal overlords to live to breathe to uh survive in the society today
[3:16:21.960 --> 3:16:25.880]  so I encourage people to do the research that you're talking about and I thank you for the
[3:16:25.880 --> 3:16:30.280]  call Charles yeah there's a lot of alternative energy out there folks and there's a lot of
[3:16:30.280 --> 3:16:35.320]  ways to get a hold of it there's a ton of info uh again salt water burns just bring it up I'd
[3:16:35.320 --> 3:16:40.200]  play the clip over the radio but it's not quite as convincing you you can do it you can get on
[3:16:40.200 --> 3:16:44.760]  google all you people that aren't computer adept go over to a friend's house and type it in but
[3:16:44.760 --> 3:16:50.360]  yeah this guy is is burning salt water creating energy I'll admit that supposedly the uh frequency
[3:16:50.360 --> 3:16:55.320]  that goes into it the amount of energy to produce that frequency is more than it actually pumps out
[3:16:55.320 --> 3:17:00.840]  so it's not zero point energy yet but uh it's it's very very interesting and I I'd like people to go
[3:17:01.400 --> 3:17:07.560]  take a look at that let's go to Helen in Florida Helen are you with us yes Jason I'm so glad to
[3:17:07.560 --> 3:17:14.040]  met you my shortwave broken down I still remembered your number uh you and Alex um I don't know

[3:21:45.160 --> 3:21:48.920]  hello ted anderson listeners of the network are familiar with the federal reserve note
[3:21:48.920 --> 3:21:53.480]  and understand the risks of deficit spending therefore with catastrophic events it comes
[3:21:53.480 --> 3:21:57.880]  as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors
[3:21:57.880 --> 3:22:02.360]  can remove from their accounts a fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your
[3:22:02.360 --> 3:22:07.480]  deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal deficit spending will skyrocket through fdic if the
[3:22:07.480 --> 3:22:12.600]  government is forced to ensure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy a current
[3:22:12.600 --> 3:22:17.720]  effort is underway by the fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors
[3:22:17.720 --> 3:22:22.760]  however an increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation
[3:22:22.760 --> 3:22:27.800]  in order to achieve strength and stability i recommend a conservative portion of all investments
[3:22:27.800 --> 3:22:33.000]  to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver while paper investments currently have been driven

[3:23:55.160 --> 3:24:02.920]  remember folks if you missed any of it any of the four jam packed hours of the alex jones show
[3:24:02.920 --> 3:24:08.440]  first hour of course alex jones second hour myself and mark dice third hour jonathan ellen
[3:24:08.440 --> 3:24:13.160]  off from we are changed colorado and now the fourth hour that is being broadcast right now over
[3:24:13.160 --> 3:24:19.720]  prison planet dot tv just taking your calls seeing what you have to say i guess i have to weed out
[3:24:19.720 --> 3:24:24.120]  through a few crazies but uh you know that's the nature of the business you're going to get crazy
[3:24:24.120 --> 3:24:29.880]  people in all walks of life right now we are talking to skip about uh tomie chong and chichen
[3:24:29.880 --> 3:24:36.200]  chong uh one of their one of their early albums i guess you said old bamboo you were the skip big
[3:24:36.200 --> 3:24:44.600]  bamboo big bamboo and if ever there were a segment that they made was made perfect for this show
[3:24:44.600 --> 3:24:50.600]  it would be that clip and what it is is it's it's like uh supposed to be a late night tv show
[3:24:50.600 --> 3:24:55.800]  some guys asleep in the tv's on and uh there's an inquisitor that's trying to get this old man
[3:24:55.800 --> 3:25:01.000]  to sign papers saying that uh he didn't torture him and get the old man to sign a paper they put
[3:25:01.000 --> 3:25:07.960]  a cigarette out on his eye it sounds bad but the way they presented it makes torture look ridiculous
[3:25:07.960 --> 3:25:12.440]  and in a humorous but understandable way you just you got to hear it and then you'll see what i'm
[3:25:12.440 --> 3:25:16.040]  talking about well yo send us the mp3 you said it's off a big bamboo what's the title of the track
[3:25:16.040 --> 3:25:20.840]  maybe we can download it tort tortured old man tortured old man all right i'll keep it in mind
[3:25:20.840 --> 3:25:25.160]  i thank you for the call skip uh we got plenty of callers here at the alex jones show let's jump
[3:25:25.160 --> 3:25:31.640]  to vinny in new york vinny are you with us yes jason how you doing today good man appreciate
[3:25:31.640 --> 3:25:36.280]  you having me on the call i've got two subjects here and hopefully i can get through them quickly
[3:25:36.280 --> 3:25:41.160]  one is ten trailing as you know is happening all over new york just basically almost every single
[3:25:41.160 --> 3:25:47.720]  day i've contacted the governor twice the office no response i've contacted the d ec commissioner
[3:25:47.720 --> 3:25:53.800]  pete granis um with at least five emails and i forwarded these emails to different people
[3:25:53.800 --> 3:25:59.720]  in the movement as well as uh ken schneider and uh other people and no response yet and you know i
[3:25:59.720 --> 3:26:06.200]  want some action on this basically to investigate that our air is being poisoned you know i go outside
[3:26:06.200 --> 3:26:12.200]  and there's a gold powder on my car i know they've been chemtrail before i even look up in the sky
[3:26:12.200 --> 3:26:16.600]  well then yeah i can't agree with you more and the the only problem is that this is obviously
[3:26:16.600 --> 3:26:21.400]  a federal program that is taking place across the country and probably globally it's probably
[3:26:21.400 --> 3:26:27.960]  really a globalist program so yes so you're i'm just saying that you're uh your attorney general
[3:26:27.960 --> 3:26:31.640]  you know new york david david patrickson the governor these guys are going to ignore you
[3:26:31.640 --> 3:26:37.160]  of what i would suggest is to go to local government to go to a city council meeting
[3:26:37.160 --> 3:26:43.640]  and have our state senator or run for office as a congressman listen i'm with you and i like
[3:26:43.640 --> 3:26:48.760]  what you've done i'm just saying that i i see it as the only way that we're gonna bring this issue
[3:26:48.760 --> 3:26:54.200]  to the forefront is through local media just like they did in california and local government
[3:26:54.200 --> 3:26:59.720]  and it is a real issue you know they're poisoning us any and uh i i just i just see those things
[3:26:59.720 --> 3:27:04.120]  being ignored ignored ignored i say take a camera down to your local city council meeting
[3:27:04.120 --> 3:27:09.960]  bring up the subject and demand demand that they bring it up with their superiors that's what i'm
[3:27:09.960 --> 3:27:14.760]  doing right now i have a local uh environmental company looking into this so we have actual
[3:27:14.760 --> 3:27:20.040]  documented tests and everything um you know the other thing is the man's name is pete granis
[3:27:20.040 --> 3:27:24.200]  and and i give out the email this may be people in the york want to email him just for fun to
[3:27:24.200 --> 3:27:32.040]  uh fill up his email box it's pete granis g r a n n i s at g w like george washington's
[3:27:32.040 --> 3:27:40.200]  dot d ec dot state dot new york dot us um you know so that was that was one issue that's
[3:27:40.200 --> 3:27:44.040]  really disturbing me that you can't even go out and it's supposed to be a clear day and
[3:27:44.040 --> 3:27:48.120]  there's poison in our air um yeah i was told to do it on a state level because the government
[3:27:48.120 --> 3:27:52.520]  is going to listen to us i figure i'd start there the other issue is how about this for an idea
[3:27:52.520 --> 3:27:56.680]  and i don't know you know it's been suggested i'm sure but have you ever heard of ifica hours
[3:27:57.480 --> 3:28:02.680]  no but i've been to ifica well ifica hours is a local currency they use wouldn't it be a nice
[3:28:02.680 --> 3:28:06.840]  idea if we'd all just start using local currency and cut the fed out of the equation we don't use
[3:28:06.840 --> 3:28:12.120]  your money anymore we use our own local currency well that is a great idea but i would also say that
[3:28:12.120 --> 3:28:16.520]  you know the way around that is to start investing in silver and gold and it's pretty easy to get a
[3:28:16.520 --> 3:28:21.880]  twenty dollar silver piece and nine times out of ten if you're at a local market and you're not at a
[3:28:21.880 --> 3:28:26.840]  walmart or a big you know complex they're going to take that that silver realizing it's hard currency
[3:28:26.840 --> 3:28:31.240]  and i think we just really got to continue to educate the masses that the federal reserve
[3:28:31.240 --> 3:28:37.400]  banking system is not federal it is a private corporatized bank that is designed designed to
[3:28:37.400 --> 3:28:44.920]  put us and keep us into debt absolutely i agree with you on her percent so all right we continue
[3:28:44.920 --> 3:28:49.080]  to pursue this uh chem trail activity though because i don't want it here in new york state
[3:28:49.080 --> 3:28:53.080]  i can't stand it and i got to tell you up and only on i see it all the time i filmed it they've

[3:33:13.480 --> 3:33:19.000]  june uh for a wedding uh one of my best friends from high school is uh getting married and uh
[3:33:19.640 --> 3:33:23.560]  you know she's a neocon she worked for george bataki for a little bit and uh
[3:33:24.360 --> 3:33:28.600]  she just won't listen to me i'm kind of laughed at i i get a couple calls here and there i remember
[3:33:28.600 --> 3:33:33.000]  she was in jamaica and uh somebody was having a screening of loose change so she gave me a ring and
[3:33:33.000 --> 3:33:37.800]  you know she's seen the movie and she just doesn't want to buy into it but i'll tell you what when i
[3:33:37.800 --> 3:33:42.040]  go to this wedding and that's in a couple weeks she's getting a copy of endgame she's getting a
[3:33:42.040 --> 3:33:46.600]  copy of marshal law she's getting a copy of loose change final cut she's getting a copy of order of
[3:33:46.600 --> 3:33:51.640]  death she's getting the whole sabango she's getting a big old stack you know and it'll be with the
[3:33:51.640 --> 3:33:57.240]  cash i give her but i i hope and i pray that at some point she's going to take a look at this
[3:33:57.240 --> 3:34:02.200]  information and it's going to scare her into into awakening you know i'm not going to give up on my
[3:34:02.200 --> 3:34:06.920]  friends i'm not going to give up on my family and i encourage all of you out there to do the same to
[3:34:06.920 --> 3:34:12.600]  keep keep trying to spread the truth no matter what the obstacle you face seems like whether it
[3:34:12.600 --> 3:34:17.640]  seems impenetrable whether you seem like you're so small that you can't have an effect that's nonsense
[3:34:17.640 --> 3:34:23.080]  we can all have an effect we can all have a big effect if we want to and we're talking to leo
[3:34:23.080 --> 3:34:28.120]  in massachusetts that feels feels that we've uh we've lost an opportunity what a what opportunity
[3:34:28.120 --> 3:34:32.920]  have we we lost out on well we haven't lost we're kind of missing the opportunity okay with all the
[3:34:32.920 --> 3:34:39.400]  gas price rises why aren't we passing out uh an address of a website to these people to find out
[3:34:39.400 --> 3:34:46.360]  why the gas is going up and i think this is a striking right at the point of production
[3:34:46.360 --> 3:34:53.080]  what website would you uh website what website would you endorse oh i would say you know uh i
[3:34:53.080 --> 3:34:59.160]  would create a website called uh why gas prices are up or something like that hey man nothing's
[3:34:59.160 --> 3:35:03.720]  stopping you from doing it maybe you don't know technologically how to do that but it's so easy
[3:35:03.720 --> 3:35:10.120]  now to get a wordpress site and it's it's literally type and publish and uh if you want to do it man
[3:35:10.120 --> 3:35:15.160]  it nothing is stopping you from doing that but more than that okay go ahead the uh the other idea i
[3:35:15.160 --> 3:35:20.600]  want is to see as somebody who really is good at making up a menu now new world order sounds like
[3:35:20.600 --> 3:35:26.280]  it's something like a restaurant you know and so i think we should have you know like appetizers
[3:35:26.280 --> 3:35:31.480]  and entrees and just desserts and all that kind of stuff well that would be a nice little youtube
[3:35:31.480 --> 3:35:35.640]  clip i gotta admit or maybe a nice little pdf pamphlet that we could spread around well i'm
[3:35:35.640 --> 3:35:40.360]  thinking of just just put it on a on a on a web page somewhere so people can copy it and put it on
[3:35:40.360 --> 3:35:45.640]  the water cooler i mean the water cooler is a powerful place if we know how to use it no i
[3:35:45.640 --> 3:35:49.960]  agree well that's why i always encourage people to talk to their co-workers to their friends to their
[3:35:49.960 --> 3:35:55.240]  family the people that are around a lot of people know this information and for some reason they
[3:35:55.240 --> 3:36:00.680]  can't get past the barrier of sharing it with others they feel like they're going to be ostracized
[3:36:00.680 --> 3:36:05.720]  they're not going to be invited to events they're going to be looked at funny look i don't care about
[3:36:05.720 --> 3:36:10.760]  that stuff you can look at me funny all you want i have the truth on my side and you know i've turned
[3:36:10.760 --> 3:36:16.040]  some heads raised some eyebrows been laughed at many a time and you just got to have a thick skin
[3:36:16.040 --> 3:36:21.400]  man this is life or death this isn't this isn't a time to let feelings get in the way leo i thank
[3:36:21.400 --> 3:36:27.400]  you for the call i'm sorry i let him go i i i apologize as soon as i say that they let you go
[3:36:28.120 --> 3:36:32.040]  you know we can't we can't fit it all in i you know i encourage him if he wants to do that
[3:36:32.040 --> 3:36:36.760]  because i think that's a great idea but really what should happen is somebody should be outside of
[3:36:36.760 --> 3:36:42.760]  an ex on mobile or a texaco with an info wars dot com banner or a uh prison planet dot com
[3:36:43.400 --> 3:36:48.360]  banner under a wire gas price is so high because this lays it out this doesn't just show you you
[3:36:48.360 --> 3:36:53.800]  know why why they're gouging you for gas this shows you how the system works how the right
[3:36:53.800 --> 3:37:00.520]  and left are fake they're controlled they're a paradigm they are putting you into a mindset
[3:37:00.520 --> 3:37:08.520]  of believing that you're a republican or a democrat or a donkey or an elephant or a conservative or
[3:37:08.520 --> 3:37:17.240]  a liberal it's all bull it's all there to put you into this two-party system where a third party
[3:37:17.240 --> 3:37:27.960]  or a fourth party or another voice does not get to speak does not get to be heard by the masses
[3:37:28.840 --> 3:37:33.320]  all right let's take another new york phone call let's go to kirk in new york kirk you with us

[3:37:55.960 --> 3:38:02.360]  uh remember new 9 11 truth rising the out the fourth of july yeah oh your backer okay go ahead
[3:38:02.360 --> 3:38:06.840]  what were you gonna say go ahead i was just gonna point i uh actually worked for an airlines out of
[3:38:06.840 --> 3:38:14.760]  leguardia and i've seen you know since 9 11 it's how the securities changed and it's just horrendous
[3:38:14.760 --> 3:38:20.680]  um now would you work do you work tsa do you work tsa no no no okay actually work for an airline
[3:38:20.680 --> 3:38:26.360]  okay so you actually work for the airline now in your opinion have you seen anything and leguardia
[3:38:26.360 --> 3:38:31.320]  is a big airport folks leguardia and jfk are two of the largest in the world um have you seen any
[3:38:31.320 --> 3:38:35.240]  evidence that there is a real terror threat in other words somebody getting through with some
[3:38:35.240 --> 3:38:40.120]  explosives uh somebody being detained for being suspicious and it turns out he did have some
[3:38:40.120 --> 3:38:44.840]  kind of connections because from what i've heard and uh my boy used to work down in leguardia
[3:38:44.840 --> 3:38:50.680]  with tsa for about four years he told me that anytime anything got through and it usually would
[3:38:50.680 --> 3:38:55.160]  come in parts like uh you know like a bomb would come in three parts and they what they would do
[3:38:55.160 --> 3:38:59.400]  is they would have a team of like five or six people but it would always end up being a drill
[3:38:59.400 --> 3:39:03.240]  and they wouldn't let him know it was a drill until they either got through with the materials
[3:39:03.240 --> 3:39:09.880]  or they busted them and they were about to detain them uh is that what you found uh i've never
[3:39:09.880 --> 3:39:17.560]  seen anything even remotely close to a threat a problem anything in fact the closest thing i could
[3:39:17.560 --> 3:39:23.960]  say that would be a problem or a threat since the tsa has been implemented uh into the security
[3:39:23.960 --> 3:39:29.640]  system uh they used to have really good people hired through the airlines to do the security
[3:39:29.640 --> 3:39:36.280]  it wasn't invasive i'm sure you remember uh and now with tsa it's it's just a free for all
[3:39:36.280 --> 3:39:41.560]  it really is it's a power trip almost you know exactly and they they love it and and really
[3:39:41.560 --> 3:39:48.440]  i mean they i saw them i think they fired really good people and you know no offense because it's
[3:39:48.440 --> 3:39:55.960]  crossed across the board i've flown all over the place and it's just they find really bad people
[3:39:55.960 --> 3:40:01.320]  it's it's disgusting everybody but it's disgusting they literally hire people that want to get in
[3:40:01.320 --> 3:40:05.240]  other people's business that want to demean other people that want to go on this power
[3:40:05.240 --> 3:40:10.680]  trip it's a revolving door there's no qualifications whatsoever you know you can get hired off the
[3:40:10.680 --> 3:40:15.880]  street as one of these guys and this is the guy that's going through your bag oh what's this
[3:40:15.880 --> 3:40:20.520]  what's that i mean i you know i'm a professional documentary filmmaker okay i go through with a
[3:40:20.520 --> 3:40:26.440]  big xl2 and a case now this is obviously a camera uh they make me take it out of the box
[3:40:26.440 --> 3:40:30.200]  then as after it's out of the box and it goes through oh well we're gonna have to swap it for
[3:40:30.200 --> 3:40:35.000]  bomb-making material i'm like it's a lens man it's it's a two thousand dollar lens and you've
[3:40:35.000 --> 3:40:40.840]  got a swab it for bomb-making material what came up in my profile that that gives you the right
[3:40:40.840 --> 3:40:44.520]  to do that what what alarm went off they already throw you through those i don't know if they've
[3:40:44.520 --> 3:40:47.480]  got them in loguardia they got them in albany so i would imagine they have them in loguardia
[3:40:47.480 --> 3:40:52.600]  but those little machines now that you step in and they put off those poofs of air to detect
[3:40:52.600 --> 3:40:55.000]  you know bomb residue or whatever you got those in loguardia
[3:40:55.880 --> 3:41:01.400]  she knows in loguardia yet but i'm sure they're on the way but uh i do know that there are some
[3:41:02.280 --> 3:41:10.440]  as far as tsa goes they have some they've put some of the uh x-ray machines downstairs the ctx
[3:41:10.440 --> 3:41:15.400]  machines to where people you know they say they're trying to make it easier for pastors to get through
[3:41:15.400 --> 3:41:22.600]  quicker um but i've actually worked and i don't want to say too much but i've worked downstairs
[3:41:23.720 --> 3:41:30.600]  near these people and i've seen just crazy things yeah i mean let's let's be clear things and you
[3:41:30.600 --> 3:41:36.280]  know i mean they go through all your bags now i get a homeland security pamphlet in my bags
[3:41:36.280 --> 3:41:41.960]  every single time i try not to put anything of too much value in a bag because i am worried
[3:41:41.960 --> 3:41:46.040]  about thievery i carry anything of any kind of value that i absolutely need
[3:41:46.040 --> 3:41:50.120]  onto the plane with me even if that makes makes it so i have to check a bag at the plane because
[3:41:50.120 --> 3:41:55.080]  they they encourage you now oh it's only one take on maybe it's two american airlines is now
[3:41:55.080 --> 3:42:00.040]  charging you for bags it's getting out of control kirk i thank you for the call i i really hope we
[3:42:00.040 --> 3:42:06.760]  can turn it around folks because the tyranny in the airport is just one small piece of the puzzle
[3:42:06.760 --> 3:42:13.560]  let's go to fred in philly fredya with us oh fred dropped off it's too bad i want to talk to him
[3:42:13.560 --> 3:42:17.320]  about the biometric wine scanner out of the out of the philly news there that's right folks

[3:42:58.200 --> 3:43:04.120]  you there oh yeah i'm hanging in here all right man what's up the same thing different day um
[3:43:04.120 --> 3:43:11.240]  um you know i almost i almost wanted to tell you about uh some crazy stuff but i was in it i didn't
[3:43:11.240 --> 3:43:18.520]  want to do it on the air so uh let's just talk about um you were just talking about how much
[3:43:18.520 --> 3:43:23.720]  trouble you were having with your friend up in new york she's from your high school and you want
[3:43:23.720 --> 3:43:30.680]  to give her the truth i can tell you that when i was 19 or 20 and i came back from my little top
[3:43:30.680 --> 3:43:35.320]  secret stint in the military i came back to my friends in high school in the midwest and i would
[3:43:35.320 --> 3:43:41.880]  say to them yeah i'm almost 50 now and i'd say do it you got no clue you know i'm weak at the knees
[3:43:41.880 --> 3:43:47.720]  it's we're just the most evil country on the planet it's amazing what we're doing i had some
[3:43:47.720 --> 3:43:52.840]  inside info and my friends looked at me who hadn't seen me in a few years and i said oh man you're
[3:43:52.840 --> 3:43:58.600]  out of your mind yeah and you're the one serving in the military see it it goes so deep that we
[3:43:58.600 --> 3:44:03.800]  don't want to believe that our country could be anything but what we were taught as a kid you
[3:44:03.800 --> 3:44:08.360]  know we did the pledge of allegiance this is the place where you you know the american dream and
[3:44:08.360 --> 3:44:12.920]  anybody can become president you can become anything you want to be and i bought into that
[3:44:12.920 --> 3:44:18.520]  i remember back in 99 when i went to uh wood stock there i was just screaming out how much i love
[3:44:18.520 --> 3:44:23.960]  this country if you didn't like it get out just total jingoism total ignorance just no idea about
[3:44:23.960 --> 3:44:29.400]  what our real foreign and domestic policy was about and you know i really feel like although
[3:44:29.400 --> 3:44:36.040]  9 11 was super tragic it really kick started the awakening in this country it's what woke me up
[3:44:36.040 --> 3:44:40.680]  it's what's woken up a lot of my friends and it continues to wake people up with the help of people
[3:44:40.680 --> 3:44:45.160]  like denis kasinich who are on the house floor now trying to impeach the president and his
[3:44:45.160 --> 3:44:52.440]  administration for their actions on an afternoon when somebody wakes up you know they uh they get
[3:44:52.440 --> 3:44:57.560]  all feverish and crazy like oh my god i gotta tell everybody this is just the best thing in the world
[3:44:58.840 --> 3:45:05.480]  and uh sometimes it's uh sometimes it's a little scary and you get a little too vocal with too much
[3:45:05.480 --> 3:45:12.920]  truth and somebody sees you and uh of the powers that be and you disappear well you know that's a
[3:45:12.920 --> 3:45:17.800]  that's a risk all of us run Pablo and uh quite frankly i just can't live in that kind of fear i
[3:45:17.800 --> 3:45:22.680]  think denis kasinich was dead on when he told alex that when you talk about these things and it is
[3:45:22.680 --> 3:45:27.320]  scary and i lost a lot of sleep i mean a lot of sleep when i first started getting into 9 11
[3:45:27.320 --> 3:45:31.560]  truth there were nights that i was just waking up in nightmares cold sweats for months at a time i
[3:45:31.560 --> 3:45:36.760]  mean it really especially after i saw roger tyranny but like denis kasinich says a lot of the times
[3:45:36.760 --> 3:45:41.000]  the things you fear you inadvertently bring into your life and i just got to live with no fear
[3:45:41.000 --> 3:45:46.680]  pablo i thank you for the call i i've got to just go day to day i i've got to be positive you know
[3:45:46.680 --> 3:45:51.400]  alex always jokes about how i'm so smiley in the studio it's because i really do enjoy life folks i
[3:45:51.400 --> 3:45:56.840]  love my life even when i was working you know 60 hours a week two separate jobs and you know i saw
[3:45:56.840 --> 3:46:02.360]  it was going on in the country and bush was being reelected i still loved my life i still knew there
[3:46:02.360 --> 3:46:09.640]  were positive forces in my life i still knew that i was a free human being and that i could i could
[3:46:09.640 --> 3:46:13.960]  create my own destiny destiny we can all create our own destinies and that's that's the bottom line if
[3:46:13.960 --> 3:46:20.600]  we get together and we want a country foreign by the people one with a constitutional government
[3:46:21.160 --> 3:46:28.440]  one that encourages freedom and civil liberties we can do it together i promise you let's go to
[3:46:28.440 --> 3:46:37.640]  mary in florida mary are you with us hi uh i own program you covered all the years constitution
[3:46:37.640 --> 3:46:50.200]  bill of rights uh fed reserve iris uh un um harp vaccines all these topics and um i just want to
[3:46:50.200 --> 3:46:57.000]  make and you believe in analogies made the points this friend i heard a few minutes ago that you're
[3:46:57.000 --> 3:47:00.600]  kind of ridiculing what these little creatures but they're afraid that we're going to blow up
[3:47:00.600 --> 3:47:05.640]  their planet along with ours that was the whole point and they've covered all these topics and
[3:47:05.640 --> 3:47:09.400]  that was the point trying to make a strong point on it not anything fairy tale whatsoever
[3:47:10.120 --> 3:47:17.160]  was the alien thing oh my all right thanks for the call jeez man i can't get rid of these alien
[3:47:17.160 --> 3:47:25.640]  people come on look i'm not gonna pretend like i know the entire universe but they love it when
[3:47:25.640 --> 3:47:31.240]  people try to associate 911 truth with spacemen and ufo's that's what the disinfo folks do
[3:47:31.240 --> 3:47:37.240]  okay that's what popular mechanics did when i debated them at democracy now they brought
[3:47:37.240 --> 3:47:43.720]  up area 51 and ufo's and holocaust denial these are the things they want you to talk about
[3:47:44.280 --> 3:47:50.600]  listen there's a reason that the last 20 years our culture has pushed these little gray men with
[3:47:50.600 --> 3:47:55.560]  big eyes okay i encourage you to go read order out of chaos by paul joseph watson he has a whole
[3:47:55.560 --> 3:48:00.440]  chapter on it now i don't know if there's life on other planets i've looked into the ufo thing
[3:48:00.440 --> 3:48:03.800]  i definitely think that they're ufo's i don't know what they are i don't know if they're
[3:48:03.800 --> 3:48:08.040]  you know military aircraft they come from another dimension they're living being god knows what they
[3:48:08.040 --> 3:48:13.000]  are okay i'm not going to pretend to know but that's garbage man i don't want to talk about that
[3:48:13.000 --> 3:48:18.600]  on a show when we're trying to save this country spacemen don't want us to blow up the world come
[3:48:18.600 --> 3:48:23.960]  on i don't want us to blow up the world i'm a real person i don't want us to blow up the country

[3:48:29.080 --> 3:48:34.440]  a real issue they built those fema camps okay they're throughout the country they've got all these
[3:48:34.440 --> 3:48:39.560]  plastic containers that look an awful lot like portable coffins stacking three bodies on top
[3:48:39.560 --> 3:48:43.880]  that's what worries me that's what concerns me and calling in with separate names so you

[3:54:49.800 --> 3:54:55.800]  has to go into a court of law that man has to you know face the justice system and do a little time
[3:54:55.800 --> 3:55:00.280]  you know he should he should spend six months in prison maybe a year if something happens to any of
[3:55:00.280 --> 3:55:05.400]  us i i really think he should be imprisoned for the rest of his life all right let's take a couple
[3:55:05.400 --> 3:55:10.360]  callers on the uh final segment here let's go to chris in florida chris are you there
[3:55:12.200 --> 3:55:18.440]  hey jason how you doing a great job thanks man i was uh gonna say a suggestion i had for you
[3:55:19.000 --> 3:55:24.760]  and what i do is um for people who are a little bit skeptical of some of the information
[3:55:25.320 --> 3:55:32.520]  what i try to do is pick something that affects them like gas prices and an uncle who was a cpa
[3:55:32.520 --> 3:55:38.920]  and i got him the creature from jack liland nice very good book by the way for fathers they got real
[3:55:38.920 --> 3:55:44.280]  real good book and you know i kind of approach it from there you know and no i do the same thing
[3:55:44.280 --> 3:55:49.960]  man exactly i exactly that's the way to do it you find common ground the problem is that this friend
[3:55:49.960 --> 3:55:55.560]  of mine she was valedictorian her father was my student guidance counselor they think they know
[3:55:55.560 --> 3:56:01.000]  it all you know they were the rich people in the in the town they they have this yuppie mentality
[3:56:01.000 --> 3:56:06.760]  this yuppie idea that they're always right you know and it doesn't matter what you put out it's
[3:56:06.760 --> 3:56:11.720]  literally gonna be something that affects them personally not just can affect them you know
[3:56:11.720 --> 3:56:16.200]  like gas prices or this and that they're gonna have to have their home taken away they're gonna
[3:56:16.200 --> 3:56:20.920]  have to have their car repoed before they start saying oh my god this stuff is real they're gonna
[3:56:20.920 --> 3:56:25.880]  have to vaccinate their kid and find out that it's got autism from these vaccinations before
[3:56:25.880 --> 3:56:30.760]  they learn some people are just that stubborn and it's not gonna stop me you know maybe i'm wrong
[3:56:30.760 --> 3:56:34.920]  maybe uh the videos i give her at the wedding they're gonna watch over the next couple months
[3:56:34.920 --> 3:56:40.120]  maybe they will have to eat that's right no and if it doesn't that's okay that's okay too because
[3:56:40.120 --> 3:56:43.480]  there's plenty of my friends that i'm going to see at this wedding too that it has worked on
[3:56:43.480 --> 3:56:47.800]  you know another one of my buddies that i'm actually going to be staying with uh in a hotel
[3:56:47.800 --> 3:56:52.200]  he was the guy i almost joined the military with uh we literally went down we took the asfab test
[3:56:52.200 --> 3:56:56.280]  together we were going to join the national guard together he ended up joining i didn't he ended up
[3:56:56.280 --> 3:57:01.320]  going to iraq i didn't he ended up getting blown up i didn't you know he lost hearing in one of his
[3:57:01.320 --> 3:57:06.120]  ears and to this day even after all the press coverage and i mean literally this kid's like
[3:57:06.120 --> 3:57:11.160]  my brother you know grew up down the block baseball soccer together everything and uh
[3:57:11.160 --> 3:57:17.560]  he will not watch loose change just in the fear that i may be able to turn his mind around and
[3:57:17.560 --> 3:57:22.040]  he doesn't think he could live with himself with the things that he did in iraq if he didn't believe
[3:57:22.040 --> 3:57:30.200]  110 in this war on terror and uh chase mm-hmm also i wanted to ask you i wanted to get a video
