[00:00.000 --> 00:12.720]  The year is 2020.
[00:12.720 --> 00:17.760]  Following several decades of systematically weakening the social, moral, and financial
[00:17.760 --> 00:22.920]  resilience of the American people, the global cabal has launched a series of unimaginable
[00:22.920 --> 00:27.880]  terrors to devrock the foundation of Western civilization and has fractured the population
[00:27.880 --> 00:32.520]  of a once-uniting country along increasingly irreconcilable lines.
[00:32.520 --> 00:37.600]  The nation finds herself on the precipice of all-out civil war, dialing headlong towards
[00:37.600 --> 00:42.480]  economic brewing and already suffocating under the dictatorship of biotechnocratic
[00:42.480 --> 00:44.320]  enslavement.
[00:44.320 --> 00:49.520]  The final takedown order has been issued, the direct attack has begun.
[00:49.520 --> 00:54.240]  America's greatest trial, and the battle for her survival, is underway.
[00:54.240 --> 00:59.920]  Civil war's emergency transmissions are now broadcasting live, midnight 7 to 9 p.m. Central
[00:59.920 --> 01:06.760]  Standard Time, election countdown, taking America back on band.video and infowars.com.
[01:06.760 --> 01:11.680]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:11.680 --> 01:21.760]  Alright, we can take this broadcast in several different ways today, we can get caught in
[01:21.760 --> 01:26.680]  all the minutiae of the incredible things that are unfolding, the hypocrisy, the gas
[01:26.680 --> 01:32.360]  sliding, the 1984 on parade, or we can get into the big picture of what the globalists
[01:32.360 --> 01:36.800]  are planning next and how to stop them and the philosophy of true leadership.
[01:36.800 --> 01:41.840]  But I think we're just going to do both today, we're going to do both here today, and this
[01:41.840 --> 01:44.440]  is going to be a very important Thursday transmission.
[01:44.440 --> 01:50.760]  Again, I want to thank you all for tuning in, it is Thursday, August 27th, the year
[01:50.760 --> 01:57.360]  is 2020, we are 67 days out from this incredibly important election, election, most important
[01:57.360 --> 02:02.800]  election really, not just in US history, but world history, and the globalists themselves
[02:02.800 --> 02:03.800]  are saying that.
[02:03.800 --> 02:09.920]  I understand their whole anti-human, new world order AI takeover is in trouble, humanity
[02:09.920 --> 02:14.440]  has not been fully submitting, a lot of signs were showing a huge awakening and people getting
[02:14.440 --> 02:20.000]  back to rural lifestyle, back to being outdoors, television viewing was peaking and starting
[02:20.000 --> 02:27.000]  to go down, the family was beginning to re-energize, cultures were becoming more conservative again,
[02:27.000 --> 02:31.200]  more pro-human and so now they're striking with everything they've got, but you talk
[02:31.200 --> 02:38.520]  about insane, the poor 17-year-old young man that went to stand in the power vacuum and
[02:38.520 --> 02:44.000]  try to be a medic and try to stop homes and businesses and government buildings being
[02:44.000 --> 02:49.440]  burned, it turns out the three people he shot, he shot in self-defense overwhelmingly, we
[02:49.440 --> 02:54.200]  have all the video, we have all the audio, we have all the witnesses and all three men
[02:54.200 --> 03:04.160]  have serious criminal records, all three men, Joseph D. Rosenbaum who was saying shoot
[03:04.160 --> 03:13.160]  me in word, shoot me in word and reportedly trying to assault the young man was a convicted
[03:13.160 --> 03:26.880]  menophile who raped a 12-year-old girl and spent a decade in prison, Joseph D. Rosenbaum,
[03:26.880 --> 03:31.880]  I'll tell you about the other two characters, but that's what all of this is, is a green
[03:31.880 --> 03:37.680]  light for the scum of the earth to go crazy, we'll put it on screen right now, the CNN
[03:37.680 --> 03:45.480]  Kiron like all the other MSNBC and CNN and ABC Kiron's, fiery but mostly peaceful protest
[03:45.480 --> 03:53.240]  after police shooting, so fiery but mostly peaceful protest after police shooting, maybe
[03:53.240 --> 03:58.000]  we put the image of the Hindenburg running into the tower and blowing up and falling
[03:58.000 --> 04:03.800]  or maybe Hiroshima or Nagasaki having atomic bombs dropped on them and just say, you know,
[04:03.800 --> 04:11.160]  fiery but mostly peaceful, we've got gunshots going on in the background that a bunch of
[04:11.160 --> 04:19.000]  burning buildings and they choose to get in front of that and then tell you that it's
[04:19.000 --> 04:23.480]  peaceful, you go, why do they keep doing that?
[04:23.480 --> 04:28.280]  It's about throwing your face, they've now come out with a Catholic diocese endorsement
[04:28.280 --> 04:34.520]  on a Boston for Biden calling him pro-life and saying abortion is pro-life, like, well
[04:34.520 --> 04:38.360]  that's insulting, well they mean to insult your intelligence, so you just get used to
[04:38.360 --> 04:42.600]  being run over, but we're not getting used to it, we're not submitting, we're not adapting
[04:42.600 --> 04:47.160]  by becoming slaves, we're adapting by improvising and overcoming.
[04:47.160 --> 04:51.120]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, we are the pro-human future, you are the pro-human future, we are
[04:51.120 --> 04:59.680]  brothers and sisters, we are humanity, we are the resistance.
[04:59.680 --> 05:04.360]  Constantly, whether it's the New York Times, the Washington Post or Howard Stern, you name
[05:04.360 --> 05:09.080]  it, they come out and they attack him full war saying, Jones claims civil wars coming
[05:09.080 --> 05:14.680]  and financial collapse and planetary lockdowns using viruses and he tells people they should
[05:14.680 --> 05:20.040]  get off the grid and get prepared and have horrible food if they can and now everything
[05:20.040 --> 05:25.160]  I've warned people about is coming true because it was all in the Rockefeller Foundation documents
[05:25.160 --> 05:31.400]  like lockstep, this is the corporate planetary takeover, so yes, I stand by what I said ten
[05:31.400 --> 05:36.160]  years ago, what I said a year ago and what I said last week more than ever, get your
[05:36.160 --> 05:41.080]  high quality storeable foods at infowarstore.com, that's one of the key check marks of the check
[05:41.080 --> 05:47.680]  boxes, you've got to have checked off, infowarstore.com and their delivery is now one to two weeks,
[05:47.680 --> 05:52.160]  get it before the next big rush comes, take action, get the best storeable food at the
[05:52.160 --> 06:12.760]  best price now at infowarstore.com and it supports the info war.
[06:12.760 --> 06:22.440]  The bombs have been placed, the fuses have been lit, the countdown has begun, it's now
[06:22.440 --> 06:31.560]  official out of the mouths of Hillary, Pelosi, Schumer and all the rest of the globalist
[06:31.560 --> 06:36.800]  criminals, they intend to challenge the election, they know the numbers are going to lose by
[06:36.800 --> 06:42.000]  a huge landslide and they're going to plunge the nation into civil war, a break up of the
[06:42.000 --> 06:49.920]  country and they're going to try to have major states secede and crown Biden the new king.
[06:49.920 --> 06:53.240]  They believe that that crisis will be so great that Trump will be blamed and forced from
[06:53.240 --> 06:58.880]  office because they'll have simultaneous riots and terrorist attacks and shootings which
[06:58.880 --> 07:03.680]  will be called peaceful racial uprisings.
[07:03.680 --> 07:10.480]  Last night a black man committed suicide and his family said he committed suicide after
[07:10.480 --> 07:19.360]  they called the police on him, so he put a guy in his mouth and shot himself on video
[07:19.360 --> 07:27.880]  and the police are to blame, if he slips on a banana peel, the police are to blame and
[07:27.880 --> 07:32.440]  so now I guess we're going to have police that are sadomasochists and want to be attacked
[07:32.440 --> 07:38.920]  and lied about because the media is behaving, I have the clips, that this is good what's
[07:38.920 --> 07:50.120]  happening in Minnesota that people are called on this individual, he blows his head off and
[07:50.120 --> 07:54.120]  then it's everybody else's fault, I mean when there's video of you shoving a gun in your
[07:54.120 --> 08:02.320]  mouth and pulling the trigger, it's everyone else's fault and the police who've been called
[08:02.320 --> 08:06.360]  on him got there reportedly in about a minute, you didn't get there quick enough it's your
[08:06.360 --> 08:12.640]  fault, we're going to loot and burn and shoot a bunch of people and a bunch of weird sickos
[08:12.640 --> 08:17.840]  are going to come out of the woodwork like cockroaches and rats and they're going to
[08:17.840 --> 08:26.440]  burn, loot and kill like Joseph D. Rosenbaum, the convicted rapist of a 12 year old girl
[08:26.440 --> 08:31.160]  who spent a decade in prison and had a horrible prison record amongst the rest of his rap
[08:31.160 --> 08:38.480]  sheet, he's the guy got shot and killed by the 17 year old gentleman who will be going
[08:38.480 --> 08:45.480]  over in a moment and then we've got the other burglary felony charges right here of the
[08:45.480 --> 08:56.120]  other individuals that were shot and their Antifa and Satanic garb, yes they were wearing
[08:56.120 --> 09:02.840]  pentagrams and bathomats and it's their time to shine, you know the official DNC logo is
[09:02.840 --> 09:11.800]  a bathomat now, it doesn't matter if pictures show young written house shot at at least
[09:11.800 --> 09:17.480]  two Bieland riders and self-defense, one rider was chasing him with a gun and is a convicted
[09:17.480 --> 09:25.280]  felon, well it turns out they're all convicted felons it's being reported on, continue to
[09:25.280 --> 09:29.400]  check that that's the best of our knowledge right off the child molester database for
[09:29.400 --> 09:38.680]  Mr. Rosenbaum, so what happens when the police are called on a man who's got a gun it's
[09:38.680 --> 09:45.280]  now confirmed in Kenosha, Wisconsin and he starts punching him and they chase him around
[09:45.280 --> 09:53.800]  and then in the exchange he gets shot and is paralyzed, you call the cops as babysitters,
[09:53.800 --> 09:59.880]  they show up to a horrible situation, things go wrong there's a gun waving around he turns
[09:59.880 --> 10:07.520]  they shoot him by the time they pull the gun he's rotated and now oh the country needs
[10:07.520 --> 10:11.240]  to burn and all white people are bad and the governor says white people are bad and that
[10:11.240 --> 10:19.520]  the police are inherently evil racists and now we know he was reaching for a gun and
[10:19.520 --> 10:24.080]  had a gun in his hand, why would any cop in his right mind want to shoot somebody and
[10:24.080 --> 10:29.480]  then get in all the trouble and face prison, they have an incredibly hard job and are there
[10:29.480 --> 10:33.280]  some bad cops or there's some people out there that pull the trigger too quick, absolutely
[10:33.280 --> 10:41.440]  where humans were failed, were flawed but here's what's really happening, law and order
[10:41.440 --> 10:47.160]  is being purposely broken down ahead of the election so when they dispute it they can
[10:47.160 --> 10:51.360]  claim oh this is about race that's why the country is burning, that's why this is happening
[10:51.360 --> 10:57.280]  and Trump's got to step down to stop the burning and the looting and Atlantic Monthly and the
[10:57.280 --> 11:04.320]  Democrats have come out since I saw them set this up months ago and admitted it and Trump
[11:04.320 --> 11:11.240]  has come out and said they are setting it up so now when somebody shoots themselves in
[11:11.240 --> 11:24.160]  the head you burn down and loot Minneapolis again, same thing for Kenosha and the media
[11:24.160 --> 11:30.000]  is calling the control corporate enemy of the people media is calling for Tucker Carlson
[11:30.000 --> 11:34.720]  to be fired again because he said when the police can't have law and order and the governors
[11:34.720 --> 11:39.880]  stand down and the blue states are run by criminals and they encourage murder and looting
[11:39.880 --> 11:46.960]  and attacks and communist militia checkpoints stop police citizens you name it in many cases
[11:46.960 --> 11:53.520]  shooting people in the head you're gonna have a power vacuum filled where people are gonna
[11:53.520 --> 12:00.520]  start hitting the streets to protect property and that's exactly what happened with a man
[12:00.520 --> 12:08.360]  who I think is a hero and who took action I'm not glad that people have been shot even
[12:08.360 --> 12:14.000]  though all three of these guys look like they're pretty bad scumbags but you're going to see
[12:14.000 --> 12:19.200]  people stand up and say no to the communists it doesn't matter how much CNN tells you or
[12:19.200 --> 12:26.000]  how many times they put up a lower third saying fiery but mostly peaceful protesters after
[12:26.000 --> 12:33.600]  police shooting with fire behind them and gunshots going off while they're saying it
[12:33.600 --> 12:42.280]  fiery but mostly peaceful protest after police shooting so again when somebody comes and burns
[12:42.280 --> 12:47.600]  down your church or your office or your home it's peaceful when we drop the atomic bombs
[12:47.600 --> 12:53.360]  on Hiroshima and Nagasaki mostly peaceful fiery but mostly peaceful when the Hindenburg
[12:53.360 --> 13:04.800]  Blimp caught on fires that hydrogen non-helium as its lift gas fiery but mostly peaceful
[13:04.800 --> 13:12.480]  the sun is fiery but mostly peaceful they bombed the bikini islands vaporizing them
[13:12.480 --> 13:18.480]  with hydrogen bombs it was fiery but mostly peaceful this is the double speak mind control
[13:18.480 --> 13:23.880]  they shoveled at us and here's Tucker Carlson last night laying out the facts that he's
[13:23.880 --> 13:29.640]  been demonized for in the daily caller was standing nearby when a man was shot in the
[13:29.640 --> 13:34.800]  head McGinnis ripped off his t-shirt and used its try and staunch the man's bleeding here's
[13:34.800 --> 14:00.800]  the steam
[14:00.800 --> 14:10.520]  sorry for the painful video but it's real that man later died at one point the 17 year
[14:10.520 --> 14:14.400]  old who's now been charged tried to run from the mob he tripped and fell in the middle
[14:14.400 --> 14:18.640]  of the street a man ran up and smashed him in the head with a skateboard the 17 year
[14:18.640 --> 14:44.800]  old then fired his gun
[14:44.800 --> 14:50.240]  so what is that amount to we're unsure a court will decide whether what you just saw qualifies
[14:50.240 --> 14:56.000]  as self-defense as if tonight we really don't have more details we do know why it all happened
[14:56.000 --> 15:01.640]  though Kenosha is devolved into anarchy because the authorities in charge of the city abandoned
[15:01.640 --> 15:08.240]  it people in charge from the governor of Wisconsin on down refused to enforce the law they stood
[15:08.240 --> 15:13.920]  back and they watched Kenosha burn so he really surprised that looting in arson accelerated
[15:13.920 --> 15:19.200]  to murder how shocked are we that 17 year olds with rifles decided they had to maintain
[15:19.200 --> 15:26.080]  order when no one else would that's right fiery but mostly peaceful so a convicted pedophile
[15:26.080 --> 15:32.680]  and two other criminals are chasing this guy one of them gets shot the young man runs again
[15:32.680 --> 15:39.000]  and a man wearing a pentagram bathroomette face mask we have the video runs up smacking
[15:39.000 --> 15:44.640]  him over the head with a skateboard he gets shot another man with a handgun extends it
[15:44.640 --> 15:51.720]  to shooting and the young man basically blows half his arm off and they charged him with
[15:51.720 --> 15:57.120]  murder with the highest level of murder he could he could face life in prison this is
[15:57.120 --> 16:04.040]  a maximum alert a maximum alert as of taking this alert you're 82 days out from the election
[16:04.040 --> 16:08.520]  as many of you know in the last year I pointed out statements out of the council on farm
[16:08.520 --> 16:13.640]  relations and other globalist organs that they know Trump is going to win in a landslide
[16:13.640 --> 16:20.040]  so their strategy will be to contest the election if they fail to successfully steal it then
[16:20.040 --> 16:24.440]  they are openly now wargaming this is in the new york times having democrat states and
[16:24.440 --> 16:30.080]  cities secede from the union just like they've ignored trumps policies and coronavirus and
[16:30.080 --> 16:34.600]  kept their areas locked down that is nothing but a dress rehearsal they are saying they're
[16:34.600 --> 16:40.000]  going to have their own separate inauguration not in DC they said in another city Colossia
[16:40.000 --> 16:47.200]  said this when they crowned Biden and Kamala Harris ladies and gentlemen this is the organized
[16:47.200 --> 16:52.240]  civil war this is their public criminal plan we should be praying we should be spreading
[16:52.240 --> 16:56.240]  the word we should be demanding trouble in the office to expose this criminal activity
[16:56.240 --> 17:02.000]  that democrats are just going more and more left many positive about socialism liking
[17:02.000 --> 17:07.480]  it more than capitalism many of the ideas we fought for that were considered radical
[17:07.480 --> 17:14.280]  are now mainstream the radical left has taken over the democratic party and Joe Biden is
[17:14.280 --> 17:19.760]  marching in lockstep with them Biden and the far left are promising to crush middle class
[17:19.760 --> 17:24.760]  families with trillions in new taxes if you elect me your taxes are going to be raised
[17:24.760 --> 17:30.760]  not cut promising amnesty and health care for 11 million illegal immigrants citizenship
[17:30.760 --> 17:36.880]  for 11 million undocumented folks promising to shut down energy exploration killing jobs
[17:36.880 --> 17:45.440]  and hurting America's economy guarantee in Joe Biden's America the radical left get whatever
[17:45.440 --> 17:51.480]  they want and you get to pay for it they've already taken over Joe Biden and the democratic
[17:51.480 --> 18:02.440]  party don't let them take over America you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:34.420 --> 18:25.360]  now I said today I'm going to get into the secrets of victory against
[18:25.360 --> 18:30.400]  the globalist what they're planning next how to stop them at all I'll do that the
[18:30.400 --> 18:36.720]  start of the next segment but just getting back to the brainwashing the gaslighting the
[18:36.720 --> 18:42.840]  oxymoronic level of seeing in MSNBC all the usual suspects saying these are mostly peaceful
[18:42.840 --> 18:46.280]  protest you know they call them peaceful the last three four months but now they call
[18:46.280 --> 18:51.680]  them mostly peaceful with fire shooting up and gunshots going off and all the rest of
[18:51.680 --> 18:58.440]  it in any excuse will go now just oh a black guy shot himself in the head okay well it's
[18:58.440 --> 19:05.320]  white people's fault because white people are inherently bad so look at these articles

[21:02.440 --> 21:07.720]  his face but you know they're heroes folks and the big tech giants are behind them because
[21:07.720 --> 21:16.520]  the woke mob is financed and supported and run by the establishment it's all the big
[21:16.520 --> 21:20.760]  mega banks all the big mega corporations all the big corrupt foreign authoritarian governments
[21:20.760 --> 21:29.720]  the EU the Shaikans Hollywood all ganged up with over 800 Soros finance district and county
[21:29.720 --> 21:37.440]  attorneys and state attorney generals and they've got most of them now for more than a decade
[21:37.440 --> 21:44.120]  he's been financing them he's getting sheriffs in too and then I've got some of the articles
[21:44.120 --> 21:50.400]  here they're announcing all over the country that they're not going to prosecute burglars
[21:50.400 --> 21:56.680]  car thieves your car can be stolen and chopped up and sold your house be broken into in fact
[21:56.680 --> 22:02.480]  I've got I see cases every day now in areas run by Soros where people beat and rape women
[22:02.480 --> 22:09.520]  where people a stab individuals for no reason and they're released without even paying a
[22:09.520 --> 22:17.840]  fine crime skyrocketing as Portland police can no longer respond to calls amid fatigue
[22:17.840 --> 22:22.240]  record retirements and riot resources but they want the police to come out and give
[22:22.240 --> 22:30.080]  you fines or arrest you if you're not wearing your mask properly oh but your church or synagogue
[22:30.080 --> 22:35.280]  or mosque it can't be open in New York but black lives matter is a key demonstration
[22:35.280 --> 22:40.800]  it is promoted and it's a good thing oh but if you want to procop rally the Bosio says
[22:40.800 --> 22:48.880]  you can't have it meanwhile comes up Kenosha man Jacob Blake had weapon in the car he was
[22:48.880 --> 22:57.200]  going for of course black lives matter writers burned much of the black business district
[22:57.200 --> 23:02.920]  also very very smart leftist Kenosha writer allegedly shot in head by call right now so
[23:02.920 --> 23:10.960]  it's convicted pedophile again it just goes on and on let me show you some more of these
[23:10.960 --> 23:17.280]  articles Seattle rioters tried to barricade police and building to burn them alive brag
[23:17.280 --> 23:27.840]  about it on video and it goes on and on and on Oregon opens coronavirus relief fund only
[23:27.840 --> 23:32.440]  for black community now they're just using blacks for that when government can start
[23:32.440 --> 23:36.920]  giving money to only certain groups they can politically control them and they can give
[23:36.920 --> 23:40.760]  it to their aid groups that divvy the money up and skim off the top that's called total
[23:40.760 --> 23:44.000]  discrimination and that's what they're trying to set up through this they're just using
[23:44.000 --> 23:52.920]  blacks as a pawn here's another one Soros DA Deanna Bekton requires offices consider
[23:52.920 --> 24:00.800]  whether a looter needed stolen goods before charging oh I needed these stolen goods well
[24:00.800 --> 24:09.400]  that's okay then daily caller reporter robbed at gunpoint during Minneapolis riots folks
[24:09.400 --> 24:16.440]  have a lot of courage but that's the type of stuff that's going on meanwhile Berlin fans
[24:16.440 --> 24:26.280]  protest against pandemic restrictions deploys thousands of police but if you're communist
[24:26.280 --> 24:29.880]  or other people you can march all you want but if you want to march to say stop the lockdown
[24:29.880 --> 24:34.280]  oh marches against the lockdown are illegal and big tech globally follows the UN edict
[24:34.280 --> 24:38.640]  that you're not allowed to have that speech the UN says it violates what is an article
[24:38.640 --> 24:44.960]  30 because the UN says you have all these rights given to you by the UN not by God and an article
[24:44.960 --> 24:52.280]  was at 29 30 and 31 it explains but if the UN says that it's damaging the UN or damaging
[24:52.280 --> 24:58.560]  any of the other rights they can take it away from you and so under articles 30 and 31 print
[24:58.560 --> 25:02.280]  those for me I'm going off memory I know it's I think it's all three yet for sure to
[25:02.280 --> 25:10.760]  up it's key under the universal declaration of human rights they do that hat trick where
[25:10.760 --> 25:13.720]  they say but actually you have none of these rights that's how the UN can go in and Rwanda
[25:13.720 --> 25:18.880]  or wherever Burma and just slaughter 800,000 people 20,000 people depending on where they
[25:18.880 --> 25:22.800]  are and they just come in with machine guns block off the villages and shoot everybody
[25:22.800 --> 25:26.960]  because if you don't move off land that the UN's taken and sold to an oil company or to
[25:26.960 --> 25:33.080]  a mineral company or a diamond company or a jewel company or a rare mineral company
[25:33.080 --> 25:37.280]  you're dead it'll just be a footnote the New York Times yeah the UN got criticized for
[25:37.280 --> 25:44.320]  their peacekeepers plating 120 something thousand tribal groups 120,000 people off the land
[25:44.320 --> 25:51.040]  they're reportedly a couple thousand deaths here and there but no big deal but see it's
[25:51.040 --> 26:00.600]  the United Nations with tanks and helicopters and machine guns so it's like apple getting
[26:00.600 --> 26:06.400]  their main components built in factories where people live in death camps and then are sent
[26:06.400 --> 26:10.840]  to work up taking hours day and then are killed later for their organs and it's all admitted
[26:10.840 --> 26:18.080]  but Tim Cook said it's okay because he's good good good gay as long as you're gay and hop
[26:18.080 --> 26:23.440]  around the little black sweater like Bill Gates his little pink sweater it's like they if they
[26:23.440 --> 26:27.640]  were Hitler uniforms we'd fight him shit was like I'm in a you know stormtrooper outfit
[26:27.640 --> 26:32.040]  I'm dangerous well yeah we know you're dangerous but they're like oh I'm Tim Cook oh and the
[26:32.040 --> 26:39.360]  UN oh UNICEF oh it loves the children oh oh it's so good it's so sweet it's so keep the
[26:39.360 --> 26:45.640]  baby comfortable like Governor Northam does and we're under the UN control there's a lot

[28:51.880 --> 28:58.000]  resist or die the new world order is here it was in the telecommunications act of 1996
[28:58.000 --> 29:04.280]  that all new cell phones would track your gps location i read from the federal law and listeners
[29:04.280 --> 29:09.960]  couldn't believe me because that was unamerican now the media admits that almost every app
[29:09.960 --> 29:15.120]  and every company that are on apple and on droids don't just track your location but
[29:15.120 --> 29:21.120]  you're surfing history where you go who you talk to your relationships and they all share
[29:21.120 --> 29:25.640]  the data with each other of what you're doing on the apps as well including having apps
[29:25.640 --> 29:32.160]  turn on and listen to what you're saying just like siri or alexa do and then putting databases
[29:32.160 --> 29:37.240]  transcripts of everything you say into those systems to be saved forever your phone is
[29:37.240 --> 29:42.040]  buying on you and companies are generating secret surveillance scores based on information
[29:42.040 --> 29:47.400]  this is the global chinese communist social credit score get your protection privacy pockets
[29:47.400 --> 30:09.520]  at info war store dot com you're listening to the alex jones show the alex jones show
[30:09.520 --> 30:23.040]  because there is a war on for your mind you know i've been meaning to do this for a long
[30:23.040 --> 30:28.680]  time and i kind of feel like i should come in with a drum roll kind of feel like i should
[30:28.680 --> 30:37.040]  come in with uh maybe the old fox searchlight intro from the start of a fox produced movie
[30:37.040 --> 30:44.640]  because this really is the key to everything and it hit me about an hour before the show
[30:44.640 --> 30:48.520]  that i wanted to come on here and do this and i got busy and never could really sit
[30:48.520 --> 30:53.640]  down and write up a few notes of the points because you can have self-help books and you
[30:53.640 --> 30:58.760]  can have you know things that give people a lot of insight into things but a lot of times
[30:58.760 --> 31:06.520]  they're written by people that really plagiarize what somebody else has said and then it gets
[31:06.520 --> 31:12.520]  twisted and it doesn't really carry the same weight because there's not the same historical
[31:12.520 --> 31:19.840]  perspective and a lot of other nuances that go into it but my experience and what i've
[31:19.840 --> 31:29.040]  learned in life if it could be truly imparted to people would be very very important for
[31:29.040 --> 31:34.960]  the future of humanity and very very important for the future of you individually just from
[31:34.960 --> 31:40.520]  a purely monetary place even if you don't care about saving the world because if you're
[31:40.520 --> 31:44.160]  not trying to save the world we're going to destroy the world you got to care and try
[31:44.160 --> 31:50.920]  to save it but we're going to lose it sociopaths are like cancer if cancer had a consciousness
[31:50.920 --> 31:58.920]  or a or intelligence a self-awareness it would realize it was killing its host but it doesn't
[31:58.920 --> 32:05.200]  have a self-awareness it's a malfunction and so i'm not building this up i'm gonna take
[32:05.200 --> 32:09.640]  a few minutes off because i've got some special reports that need to be aired anyways and then
[32:09.640 --> 32:12.560]  i'm gonna go sit in the coffee room and write a few notes up on this because i had it all
[32:12.560 --> 32:19.440]  codified at my head and i was ready to do it today and i still am but i this is big
[32:19.440 --> 32:26.760]  mojo this is big medicine this is this is this is big wampum and a lot of what i'm gonna
[32:26.760 --> 32:32.080]  say you're already going to know but it's really true and it's the input to sub it and
[32:32.080 --> 32:37.800]  the action of it and the understanding that it isn't work it is it is it is growth it
[32:37.800 --> 32:46.040]  is empowerment and it's the only way so katelyn Bennett's done just a really good job with
[32:46.040 --> 32:51.600]  her latest report katelyn Bennett destroys BLM radicals it's posted it banned on video
[32:51.600 --> 32:54.440]  it's a very important report i don't have time to air the whole thing but i'm part of it
[32:54.440 --> 32:58.420]  here and then i'm gonna come back and get into the big secret and then we'll open the
[32:58.420 --> 33:07.840]  phones up next hour and get into all the other big issues but i'm gonna talk about key philosophy
[33:07.840 --> 33:12.080]  to how the world really works that you'll only discover if you've been through a bunch
[33:12.080 --> 33:16.800]  of stuff it's not like native intelligence would know all this you have to have native
[33:16.800 --> 33:21.240]  intelligence but then also interface with it and then have the long term experiences
[33:21.240 --> 33:28.320]  of it to really know what we're contending with and it makes it very easily to defeat
[33:28.320 --> 33:39.240]  the new world order until you realize one thing so we'll talk about leadership in the
[33:39.240 --> 33:44.200]  next segment here's part of katelyn Bennett when she destroys the george soros almost
[33:44.200 --> 33:48.000]  completely white and again nothing against white people it's just a bunch of horrible
[33:48.000 --> 33:51.800]  communist white people that try to go into black neighborhoods to stir up young black
[33:51.800 --> 33:58.240]  kids and mainly white child molesters i mean i told you auntie was almost all child molesters
[33:58.240 --> 34:09.200]  and and and now the dead guys child molesters devil worshipers you name it arm burglars
[34:09.200 --> 34:13.480]  i mean i don't just say they're devil worshiping child molesters i don't just pull that out
[34:13.480 --> 34:20.480]  of the sky just to say it i'm telling you what i have in 20 plus years 26 years 30 years
[34:20.480 --> 34:25.760]  on the ground almost what i have observed and now that you're seeing it come out from
[34:25.760 --> 34:30.160]  under the floorboards you're like oh that's exactly what he said i've been down in the
[34:30.160 --> 34:36.440]  floorboards there's even nastier stuff starting to crawl out believe it because you're gonna
[34:36.440 --> 34:43.440]  see it that's one good thing about all this time for denials over baby we tried to stop
[34:43.440 --> 34:50.320]  all this for it got rolling it's rolling down the hill on us it's it's bad it's fiery but
[34:50.320 --> 34:57.120]  mostly peaceful though here's part of a report i think autos deserve to be looted and burned
[34:57.120 --> 35:01.320]  to the ground well it is a big corporation and they have insurance can you give me the
[35:01.320 --> 35:06.040]  definition of systemic racism i don't know the exact definition i don't read the exact
[35:06.040 --> 35:10.280]  definition of so you don't know the definition but you're gonna tell me that it exists yes
[35:10.280 --> 35:15.960]  it definitely does okay so where is a systemic issue where is a law that's in the system
[35:15.960 --> 35:22.160]  or is a policy that's in the system of systemic racism in our country i don't want to talk
[35:22.160 --> 35:30.560]  anymore what do you think of the black lives matter riots are they good bad i think they're
[35:30.560 --> 35:35.200]  well deserved because there's definitely is a lot of systematic racism still in the country
[35:35.200 --> 35:40.320]  you think autos deserve to be looted and burned to the ground well it is a big corporation
[35:40.320 --> 35:45.240]  and they have insurance so it didn't should be like i can't i can't speak on that because
[35:45.240 --> 35:49.680]  if i'm not black and i can't say what's right and what's wrong because i don't experience
[35:49.680 --> 35:53.920]  the racism that they do so because you're not black you can't say that autos own and
[35:53.920 --> 35:58.960]  their workers didn't do anything to deserve to be burned to the ground i can't say how
[35:58.960 --> 36:04.520]  other people feel it's not me experience the racism it's so if someone came to your home
[36:04.520 --> 36:08.960]  burnt your car took your money burnt your house down would you say well i can't tell
[36:08.960 --> 36:12.800]  them what's right and wrong because i'm not black i don't know how that feels no because
[36:12.800 --> 36:17.800]  then at that point becomes personal okay but at their point it's their personal know of
[36:17.800 --> 36:22.400]  what's happening it's not personal for the manager or the workers that work there for
[36:22.400 --> 36:26.680]  their their uh stuff to be destroyed their workplaces to be burnt to the ground do you
[36:26.680 --> 36:30.480]  see what i'm saying but they'll be compensated you won't be compensated if your house burned
[36:30.480 --> 36:35.880]  down but they'll be compensated from the company we don't know how insurance works i mean have
[36:35.880 --> 36:39.680]  you investigated that are you like for sure that's going to happen they're good with these
[36:39.680 --> 36:44.720]  riots they have insurance like if if they were to have a regular fire they have insurance
[36:44.720 --> 36:49.040]  so they can work they can support their workers if they're a good company they'll do that
[36:49.040 --> 36:53.480]  do you have insurance yes so it's okay if someone comes up and just smacks you in the
[36:53.480 --> 36:58.400]  face or knocks a tooth loose or breaks your nose you can go have insurance well i don't
[36:58.400 --> 37:03.040]  know that's what people felt like doing because they're because of racism because you have
[37:03.040 --> 37:08.160]  insurance it's okay but that's not what's happening there that is what's happening they're going
[37:08.160 --> 37:12.880]  up to hurting people but they're going up to big companies not going up to you in the
[37:12.880 --> 37:16.680]  street and beating you down they're going up to big companies that have no they aren't
[37:16.680 --> 37:19.880]  doing it to me because i'm not in the middle of these riots but they are going up to business
[37:19.880 --> 37:24.720]  owners black and white and they're killing them in the streets in portland a man almost
[37:24.720 --> 37:29.240]  lost his life because he was just trying to protect a woman that was out there getting
[37:29.240 --> 37:34.720]  beat up in these riots yeah and he was protecting them do you think that woman deserve that
[37:34.720 --> 37:38.680]  because they may have felt like they just they need to do that for racism they need
[37:38.680 --> 37:43.800]  to be protected so what doesn't deserve to be looted or burned down because of racism
[37:43.800 --> 37:49.840]  can you tell me the fine line so corporations yes mom and pop shops no yeah small businesses
[37:49.840 --> 37:55.040]  no because they don't have the insurance that auto zone does so what is it about insurance
[37:55.040 --> 38:00.480]  that makes something okay to burn down what's this magical word insurance that makes it
[38:00.480 --> 38:06.600]  okay to destroy property well it's okay to burn down but it's a fact of like the matter
[38:06.600 --> 38:10.960]  why it what it represents and what does auto zone represent in this black lives matter
[38:10.960 --> 38:15.120]  discussion what does auto represent to you what does it represent to you it's a company
[38:15.120 --> 38:20.200]  that someone built they they have workers there that need that to pay their bills and put
[38:20.200 --> 38:24.720]  food on the table for their family that's what that represents it represents a company
[38:24.720 --> 38:29.240]  that I can go to consensually and purchase things that I would need and in return I'm
[38:29.240 --> 38:34.560]  paying somebody salary that's only half the report it's it's excellent and this is black
[38:34.560 --> 38:41.920]  lives matter too white maybe he's a little Hispanic people obviously they look upper
[38:41.920 --> 38:47.160]  middle class very sheltered very delusional they're wearing fancy designer clothes you

[41:36.880 --> 41:41.560]  later now they say it's permanent you got to wear masks forever and forced inoculations

[42:59.920 --> 43:05.440]  new world order chai com globalist syndicate is making its move to implode the dollar and
[43:05.440 --> 43:10.400]  thrust the United States into a civil war by contesting the election they are openly
[43:10.400 --> 43:14.800]  wargaming this at the highest levels of democratic party Nancy Pelosi and others have gone on
[43:14.800 --> 43:20.480]  television and said they will contest the election Trump is going they will hold a separate
[43:20.480 --> 43:25.840]  inauguration for Biden and Kamala Harris and anyone challenging that will be called a racist
[43:25.840 --> 43:31.480]  they will then trigger race riots and violence they've already beta tested around the country
[43:31.480 --> 43:36.240]  we are not living in normal times when these type of things happen in history people are
[43:36.240 --> 43:41.440]  usually caught flat footed because they can't believe they're living in such a criminal era
[43:41.440 --> 43:45.880]  we are we are living in the period where this criminal globalist syndicate has been feeding
[43:45.880 --> 43:50.960]  on America is being exposed and removed now is the time for all good men and women to
[43:50.960 --> 43:59.840]  come to their aid of the country spread the word now paul reveres you're listening to the alex
[43:59.840 --> 44:24.720]  jones show
[44:24.720 --> 44:50.640]  all right i'm not ready to cover this topic i gotta rebroadcast um i gotta go take care
[44:50.640 --> 44:54.720]  of technical stuff around the office anyone else i may have to stand the show today people
[44:54.720 --> 44:59.040]  just do that not a big deal i just i got too many little technicals i got to deal with
[44:59.040 --> 45:02.240]  and i'm very frustrated because i think i've got work i need to get done here at the office
[45:02.240 --> 45:07.480]  to win the war and maybe it's time for me to stop hosting the show because i could be here
[45:07.480 --> 45:12.600]  and get so much done and get things organized if i maybe do the show once a week maybe that's
[45:12.600 --> 45:18.560]  the answer to all this because i really got a lot of work i need to get done okay we got
[45:18.560 --> 45:24.120]  some really good reports here for everybody a lot of really important things for everybody
[45:24.120 --> 45:38.480]  here let's see what we're gonna hear oh hell we just need to air a lot of these of these
[45:38.480 --> 45:42.360]  things all speak for themselves you know what i mean let's air clip 15 tucker carlson and
[45:42.360 --> 45:50.840]  josh holly and then uh let's uh go to ticking time bomb and then we'll figure out something
[45:50.840 --> 45:56.320]  after that stay with us are we gonna see joe biden in the next couple of days after three
[45:56.320 --> 46:02.880]  months of encouraging this violence tell us that he's against it now of course not and
[46:02.880 --> 46:07.840]  the reason is tucker is that the the marxist left and let's just call it what it is the
[46:07.840 --> 46:11.840]  marxist left is essentially in control now the democratic party i mean these are the
[46:11.840 --> 46:17.520]  people who say that america is structurally oppressive and structurally racist and structurally
[46:17.520 --> 46:23.200]  evil and joe biden is is absolutely enthralled to them so this is why he can't come out and
[46:23.200 --> 46:27.320]  condemn what we're seeing right in front of our own eyes which is the assault on law abiding
[46:27.320 --> 46:31.960]  americans and it's time for republicans to stand up clearly and say enough is enough
[46:31.960 --> 46:36.560]  we're not going to be part of this we're not going to condone this ideology this marxist
[46:36.560 --> 46:41.960]  ideology and we're going to protect the american people it's the first job of government and
[46:41.960 --> 46:46.960]  it's time that the american people were protected law abiding citizens it is the first job of
[46:46.960 --> 46:51.160]  government amen you said that is clearly as i've heard anybody say are we gonna start
[46:51.160 --> 46:57.200]  to see more republican office holders say what you just said well i sure hope so and
[46:57.200 --> 47:01.840]  i hope that we will send a very clear message as republicans that this is the job of government
[47:01.840 --> 47:07.560]  and any elected official who has law enforcement responsibility and won't do it needs to resign
[47:07.560 --> 47:11.040]  that means these democrat governors and mayors who are allowing their streets to descend
[47:11.040 --> 47:16.320]  into chaos allowing workers and their families to be assaulted they need to resign and i
[47:16.320 --> 47:20.480]  would just say that the president united states i'd encourage him to use all lawful means
[47:20.480 --> 47:25.000]  at his authority as he has pledged to do to protect the american people in every city
[47:25.000 --> 47:29.200]  it shouldn't be just because you live in a blue state or you live in a blue city that
[47:29.200 --> 47:33.400]  therefore you are not entitled to the rule of law the protection of law every american
[47:33.400 --> 47:38.320]  deserves it as an american and it's time that we sent that message loud and clear it's exactly
[47:38.320 --> 47:42.580]  right because when government won't protect its citizens you get chaos and seventeen
[47:42.580 --> 47:46.680]  year olds with guns start showing up and saying i need to protect the city i mean that's
[47:46.680 --> 48:02.680]  what happens when the police disappear
[48:02.680 --> 48:25.760]  state of war and you have precious little time to save yourself
[48:25.760 --> 48:34.320]  it's a slow process which we call active measures the first state being demoralization it takes
[48:34.320 --> 48:41.760]  from fifteen to twenty years to demoralize the nation the next stage is destabilization
[48:41.760 --> 48:49.360]  what matters is essentials economy foreign relations defense systems the next stage
[48:49.360 --> 48:59.840]  is crisis with a violent change of power structure and economy period of normalization this is
[48:59.840 --> 49:05.360]  what will happen in united states if you allow all these schmucks to put a big brother government
[49:05.360 --> 49:22.720]  in washington dc we will promise lots of things never mind whether the promises are fulfilled
[49:22.720 --> 49:28.160]  or not i'm not throwing a fit here on air because of the crew i am i am just in i am
[49:28.160 --> 49:32.760]  an information complete overload right now i mean i've got so much good news here i've
[49:32.760 --> 49:39.640]  got so much bad news here and i've got so much coming in and so much breaking and so
[49:39.640 --> 49:45.920]  much intel that i'm just overwhelmed because we've got all this exciting stuff happening
[49:45.920 --> 49:49.000]  but i've got to process all this and then i already had something else planned right
[49:49.000 --> 49:55.040]  now and then all the things being put on my desk are incredible because other hosts on
[49:55.040 --> 49:59.200]  other shows who like an hour and maybe forty five minutes of that's their time it's all
[49:59.200 --> 50:03.520]  pre-program it's teleprompters they go to this clip they say that they read this with
[50:03.520 --> 50:06.960]  me i'm telling them what to do i'm getting the articles they're getting the articles
[50:06.960 --> 50:11.520]  i'm reading these things i'm reading documents i'm taking calls from the crew i'm taking
[50:11.520 --> 50:15.440]  calls from my wife and i'm not complaining i think i need to just start turning my cell
[50:15.440 --> 50:26.960]  phone off when i am up here on the air because i hit this max out point now uh where i just
[50:26.960 --> 50:31.400]  can't do it and the show's a good broadcast we got sixty seven days out you can cut the
[50:31.400 --> 50:36.160]  suspense with a knife we all know it uh i i've started this thing the last few months
[50:36.160 --> 50:41.000]  where i have to go to rebroadcast sometime just so i don't start yelling and screaming
[50:41.000 --> 50:47.600]  but we have some very good news and some very exciting news and some incredible news that
[50:47.600 --> 50:53.240]  if we just package this information right like this one story that's breaking around
[50:53.240 --> 50:57.720]  the country it would defeat the whole cup of nineteen hoax and if people got excited
[50:57.720 --> 51:01.920]  about that it would stop the post industrial world and the global collapse and the hell
[51:01.920 --> 51:08.640]  that's coming and so yeah i don't choke under pressure of giving a speech or the police or
[51:08.640 --> 51:15.800]  you know stuff like that but i do get overwhelmed of the pressure that if we don't do this just
[51:15.800 --> 51:20.120]  right we're screwed and and that's really what i'm trying to get across to everybody
[51:20.120 --> 51:24.760]  is that we're not in the normal times we were before that were tumultuous and that were
[51:24.760 --> 51:29.640]  dangerous and we're out of control i mean look at this story on info wars dot com now
[51:29.640 --> 51:36.240]  again we already knew about this five months ago but now it's breaking that from florida
[51:36.240 --> 51:44.560]  to texas to california to new york to michigan to pennsylvania to ohio to arkansas everywhere
[51:44.560 --> 51:53.480]  they purposely did a hundred to one two hundred to one three hundred to one fake covid positives
[51:53.480 --> 51:57.880]  well we know if one person has it they say fifteen have it so when you hear trumps taking
[51:57.880 --> 52:06.200]  away stuff from the cdc and not letting them count people that have covid is having covid
[52:06.200 --> 52:23.440]  but they don't have it i mean this story alone and the pre meditated evil of this look at
[52:23.440 --> 52:30.720]  this article in info wars dot com texas county drops from four thousand six hundred active
[52:30.720 --> 52:40.840]  covid cases to under a hundred after audit and this is on the local news in collin county
[52:40.840 --> 52:45.360]  but i guarantee you like the sun came up this morning if medical doctors come out and talk
[52:45.360 --> 52:49.680]  about this it'll get banned off youtube facebook and twitter faster and you can say kiss my
[52:49.680 --> 52:55.560]  ass all right i'm gonna go to break and then i've got they've got a criminal investigation
[52:55.560 --> 53:01.040]  thank god the just department is at least open criminal investigations on these democrat
[53:01.040 --> 53:06.800]  governors that sent infected people with other diseases into in the nursing homes to kill
[53:06.800 --> 53:11.160]  a bunch of old people to get higher numbers because they had to have some numbers cold
[53:11.160 --> 53:15.520]  blooded murderers qualmo and all the rest of them knew some just all of the scum of
[53:15.520 --> 53:19.880]  the earth my god that's all coming up that's that's big that's big positive news i should
[53:19.880 --> 53:25.640]  open the show up with that so the pressure is getting to me the pressure is getting everybody
[53:25.640 --> 53:29.240]  it's one hell of a ton to be alive but whatever you do let's win this fight tell everybody
[53:29.240 --> 53:32.600]  right now about the broadcast and i'm gonna come back in the next hour and i'm gonna
[53:32.600 --> 53:38.120]  nail the secrets to the feeding the globalist and what they're gonna move next with if we
[53:38.120 --> 53:43.560]  don't stop them and just a basic philosophy that makes my head hurt but is really important
[53:43.560 --> 53:47.240]  in telling information that i know you're already gonna recognize and know yourself but the
[53:47.240 --> 53:51.920]  key is getting that kernel of knowledge that can grow a mighty oak tree out to everyone
[53:51.920 --> 53:57.840]  else and again support the broadcast get info wars t-shirt spread the word meet like-minded

[57:01.640 --> 57:11.800]  giving you an hour of pure excellence i promise this is clear deception yep this is clearly an
[57:11.800 --> 57:17.560]  attack on america from the media yep yep it's a technocracy you know and it's and the worst part
[57:17.560 --> 57:24.200]  of this technocracy is that the nerds are dumb you know bill gates is dumb the who is dumb you
[57:24.200 --> 57:31.160]  know it reminds me that in june or late may who had to end up retracting they said that there
[57:31.160 --> 57:36.520]  you couldn't make antibodies from the coronavirus and then everybody said okay well then how are
[57:36.520 --> 57:41.240]  we supposed to have a vaccine and then who ended up withdrawing that tweet withdrawing that letter
[57:41.240 --> 57:45.160]  so that bill gates could go out and say oh it's coming in four months it's coming in two months
[57:45.160 --> 57:48.440]  it's coming at the end of the year it's coming at the beginning of next year and it just seemed
[57:48.440 --> 57:52.840]  a little schizophrenic and so here we go with the second pass at it where they're going to
[57:52.840 --> 57:56.760]  throttle us with the science throw us into a schizophrenic rage and then we're just going
[57:56.760 --> 58:02.680]  to listen to the technocrats who again are crappy nerds they don't actually understand what they're
[58:02.680 --> 58:07.160]  talking about you'll see once again you'll see written house running away you'll see this guy
[58:07.160 --> 58:11.160]  with the red shirt wrapped around his face chasing after him he throws something and then you see him
[58:11.160 --> 58:15.560]  basically attack and at that point you hear the gunfire and then written house actually runs around
[58:15.560 --> 58:20.520]  the cars and re enters the frame on the left so let's go to clip number six now this is the first
[58:20.520 --> 58:28.760]  shooting i believe this is from bg on the scene if i'm not mistaken so here's some pain
[58:33.080 --> 58:38.120]  and here you see written house once again entering from the left there he is he approaches the man
[58:38.120 --> 58:43.320]  who is now down having been shot in the head he looks at him he gets his phone out he actually
[58:43.320 --> 58:49.000]  calls 911 and as he's running away it's very faint you can actually hear him say i just shot somebody
[58:49.000 --> 58:54.280]  we're thinking that he called 911 which is the proper thing to do if you are in a shootout
[58:54.280 --> 58:58.360]  as a legal gun owner the first thing you do is call the police and let them know what happened
[58:58.360 --> 59:03.000]  and let them know you're not a threat i'll tell you right now and i've been saying it for a long
[59:03.000 --> 59:09.640]  long time and i wonder if anyone in dc is ever gonna pull their head out of their inflated ass
[59:09.640 --> 59:21.400]  cut the head off the snake period i don't know what you got to do to get rid of this mainstream
[59:21.400 --> 59:28.040]  media propaganda i don't know what you got to do to stop the black lives matter and antifa riot mobs
[59:28.040 --> 59:33.720]  i don't know what you got to do to bring down this democrat terrorist hate group cabal i don't know
[59:33.720 --> 59:38.120]  what you got to do to stop sorrows from funding all of it i don't know what you got to do to remove
[59:38.120 --> 59:45.000]  all of obama's judges off the bench and all of sorrows's lawyers off of the bench but you better
[59:45.000 --> 59:53.560]  do it and you better do it fast real fast otherwise all this stuff about oh the best is yet to come
[59:53.560 --> 1:00:02.920]  well unless you have a bloodlust for death in the streets then no no the best is not yet to come
[1:00:02.920 --> 1:00:13.960]  um so with that we go out to your phone calls you'll get two minutes max so we
[1:00:16.360 --> 1:00:20.840]  yeah he even is tolerant there he's getting attacked and he doesn't even fire yet now he's falling
[1:00:23.320 --> 1:00:25.560]  there's the first shot there's the second
[1:00:25.560 --> 1:00:32.680]  third and he gets up
[1:00:34.280 --> 1:00:40.440]  and continues to calmly walk away of your other gunfire ring out now we're not even sure where
[1:00:40.440 --> 1:00:46.280]  that's coming from and this clip actually continues as call written house uh runs to the police and
[1:00:46.280 --> 1:00:51.640]  you actually see him basically attempt to turn himself in uh at the end of this clip he's walking
[1:00:51.640 --> 1:00:55.080]  towards the police there that are now approaching the scene they've been alerted that somebody's been
[1:00:55.080 --> 1:01:02.280]  shot uh and the ems and uh police are rushing in like they always do like they are paid to do like
[1:01:02.280 --> 1:01:07.480]  you know is a prerequisite for having any sort of civilization the police the authority who have
[1:01:07.480 --> 1:01:13.800]  been endowed with the monopoly on violence in order to quell unrest just like this they are now
[1:01:13.800 --> 1:01:18.040]  rushing towards the scene you see uh call written house approaching with his hands up here's the
[1:01:18.040 --> 1:01:27.800]  slow motion of that second shooting event you see somebody tried to jump on him to attack him he
[1:01:27.800 --> 1:01:32.120]  gets shot you see somebody else hit him in the head with a skateboard he is shot now there's a
[1:01:32.120 --> 1:01:38.600]  brief moment and where this guy pauses and then attacks now it's hard to see in this video but
[1:01:38.600 --> 1:01:44.920]  we'll show you with these still images that last person to attack was holding a pistol at the time
[1:01:44.920 --> 1:01:50.120]  and was near um you know this is some of the excellent reporting you get on the war room
[1:01:50.120 --> 1:02:01.800]  it's amazing three p.m. central you hear that that's the march of the united nations
[1:02:03.080 --> 1:02:09.240]  and the billa malinda gage foundation coming with their battle plan psychological warfare
[1:02:09.240 --> 1:02:15.240]  operation with the forced inoculations and the permanent lockdown of civilization and
[1:02:15.240 --> 1:02:20.920]  society they're outlawing people being able to get colds or the flu they're creating artificial
[1:02:20.920 --> 1:02:25.480]  phobias for normal death that takes place they're not even promising to have a cure to it all
[1:02:25.480 --> 1:02:31.160]  they're just inflicting new phobias on everyone to bring in their planetary regime directed by the
[1:02:31.160 --> 1:02:40.040]  who with vaccines that actually change your dna and make you owned by microsoft it's a final
[1:02:40.040 --> 1:03:02.840]  frontier it's the year 2020 it's not coming it's here and submission is blood in the water
[1:03:02.840 --> 1:03:09.480]  never before have i turned on you you look too good to me the media i think i crap me into and i
[1:03:09.480 --> 1:03:15.240]  just can't let you be but it's a free for all and the heart has said you can't bet your life
[1:03:15.240 --> 1:03:33.720]  all right this can't be done in one show or one segment but i'm gonna give it a shot
[1:03:34.600 --> 1:03:36.840]  i'm your host alex jones we're now in the second hour
[1:03:38.920 --> 1:03:42.280]  we have some special guests coming up i'll tell you about one in studio but let me just start now
[1:03:42.280 --> 1:03:50.760]  we can look at the world and take each event on its own and just address it in a one-dimensional
[1:03:50.760 --> 1:03:58.440]  fashion or we can look what has led to that and obviously hollywood the chinese that
[1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:03.640]  communists that know most of it have financed the race riots the breakdown of civilization
[1:04:03.640 --> 1:04:12.440]  with all the purge movies and all the hunt movies but it's not conservatives that are hunting the
[1:04:12.440 --> 1:04:18.520]  innocent liberals that was in all the earlier purges then the new movies came out where the
[1:04:18.520 --> 1:04:27.240]  left hunts the right wing that's all just a tiny microcosm of being two-dimensional
[1:04:27.240 --> 1:04:34.600]  seeing the pre-programming for race war in hundreds of shows hundreds of movies tens
[1:04:34.600 --> 1:04:40.520]  of thousands of news articles and then going gee i wonder why they're pushing that
[1:04:42.760 --> 1:04:47.160]  and then you can read wiki leaks white papers you can read documents you can see statements
[1:04:47.160 --> 1:04:52.120]  by the communists and by the globalists and by the chikoms admitting they plan to break our country up
[1:04:52.120 --> 1:05:01.080]  and it all culminated with the joker early this year which showed rioting and killing police and
[1:05:01.080 --> 1:05:06.360]  burning everything down and how beautiful and wonderful it is to put out the green light
[1:05:08.120 --> 1:05:13.320]  to all the child molesters and all the methods and all the devil worshipers to go out and go crazy
[1:05:14.040 --> 1:05:18.600]  and try to get black people to go along with you and look it was just black people doing this or
[1:05:18.600 --> 1:05:23.080]  leading it i'd say it there's a lot of black folks involved but they're mainly young and dumb
[1:05:24.040 --> 1:05:29.160]  it's it's led by really trashy white people and then academics above them so i said i'd come to
[1:05:29.160 --> 1:05:35.560]  this segment and give you solutions to the big enchilada well first off people need to realize
[1:05:35.560 --> 1:05:46.760]  that being aware and being informed and being engaged is not work it is building your mental
[1:05:46.760 --> 1:05:53.160]  muscles it's it's making neuron neural connections that you're an active person in the world that's
[1:05:53.160 --> 1:06:00.680]  affecting your destiny and others not a receiver not a jellyfish not a potted plant that doesn't
[1:06:00.680 --> 1:06:07.240]  control its own destiny and so first you have to decide that you have a destiny
[1:06:09.640 --> 1:06:13.480]  and then you have to get knowledge and history and understanding and then
[1:06:13.480 --> 1:06:17.320]  you have to really think about what is the nature of the world and discover that there's
[1:06:17.320 --> 1:06:20.680]  good versus evil and that's a constant and it's a law of the universe
[1:06:22.920 --> 1:06:28.760]  and then you have to decide that you do have a soul and and and that you're an electrical
[1:06:28.760 --> 1:06:37.240]  being of energy not a white person not a black person not an old person not a young person but a
[1:06:37.240 --> 1:06:44.120]  transcendent creation made the image of god and the enemy knows that and doesn't like that
[1:06:47.400 --> 1:06:50.360]  so you have to love yourself because you love god and god made you
[1:06:52.200 --> 1:06:58.040]  but you have to hate the part of you that is not closest to god to recognize that you have to
[1:06:58.040 --> 1:07:07.320]  choose who you serve serve god serve yourself so there's all these books about self-help and all
[1:07:07.320 --> 1:07:11.800]  these different ideas and I quite frankly I haven't read it hardly any of them I've scanned over them
[1:07:11.800 --> 1:07:16.360]  and it's regurgitation of three or four different old philosophies and a lot of it's true a lot of
[1:07:16.360 --> 1:07:29.240]  it's not but if you're a leader here's an example if you're a leader are you a leader leading people
[1:07:29.240 --> 1:07:34.280]  according to the orthodoxy or according to a particular system are you a good manager are
[1:07:34.280 --> 1:07:41.720]  you a good priest of whatever order it is you're pushing did you originate by a direct connection
[1:07:41.720 --> 1:07:51.000]  to god and in god's universe the prime directive or was it some filtered system of man another
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:59.320]  knowledge of evil fallen system and so that's the beginning of are you a leader leading people in
[1:07:59.320 --> 1:08:08.600]  someone else's philosophy or are you a leader seeking the truth using god's discernment god's
[1:08:08.600 --> 1:08:14.280]  spirit through you to gain greater knowledge of the universe to help others and help yourself
[1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:19.800]  build a wider greater pure more beautiful enlightened open system
[1:08:23.400 --> 1:08:29.080]  but to do that you're not just going to have to focus on god's guidance you're
[1:08:29.080 --> 1:08:35.320]  going to have to face the darkness and realize what it is because to know god and to know the
[1:08:35.320 --> 1:08:48.520]  light is to also know say and to not play games with that so real leadership is pure individualism
[1:08:48.520 --> 1:08:55.080]  connected to god but realizing that you yourself will have to make sacrifices for the greater
[1:08:55.080 --> 1:08:59.320]  collective now they invert that and say oh we're all a collective but a small group tells what to
[1:08:59.320 --> 1:09:04.840]  do no no no individuals make decisions that are right for everyone and themselves and others
[1:09:04.840 --> 1:09:14.120]  for the greater good that is the pure collectivism of god but in that collective in that colony
[1:09:14.120 --> 1:09:18.840]  organism there is the individual spirit the individual cell the individual system
[1:09:20.760 --> 1:09:30.200]  that is pointed at god not pointed at man's system that's why we have god over our republic because
[1:09:30.200 --> 1:09:35.240]  man would make themselves god we have to recognize we are not god we are not the highest there is a
[1:09:35.240 --> 1:09:40.120]  transcendence there are more levels above us we must recognize that we are children
[1:09:43.160 --> 1:09:46.600]  now i can talk for a thousand hours on these subjects but i just want you to understand that
[1:09:47.960 --> 1:09:52.440]  let's just get to some basics i talked about one example of propaganda and not being one-dimensional
[1:09:53.400 --> 1:09:59.560]  being two-dimensional well three-dimensional would be well okay we know that there's propaganda
[1:09:59.560 --> 1:10:04.280]  making us do this why is this being done who is behind that that's third-dimensional
[1:10:06.280 --> 1:10:12.200]  and then fourth-dimensional what is the oppositional groups what's the larger pantheon of systems and
[1:10:12.200 --> 1:10:17.400]  is there a fifth-dimensional system directing those systems against each other for another aim
[1:10:18.200 --> 1:10:23.240]  you can't just look at this aim the right hand or the left hand aim you have to then look at the
[1:10:23.240 --> 1:10:29.000]  larger systems around that and what is really governing them and most people that are at advanced
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:33.880]  level of research understand the universe gets stuck at a fifth-dimensional level but then there
[1:10:33.880 --> 1:10:41.000]  are the dimensions above that you caught up in the fifth dimension in the complexity and the
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:46.840]  machiavellianness of it from a human perspective and you think that oh it must get more complex as
[1:10:46.840 --> 1:10:54.360]  you go up but it actually gets more simple but more pure but because we're not pure beings we
[1:10:54.360 --> 1:10:59.720]  cannot even begin to read that information understand it because we're children and it's
[1:10:59.720 --> 1:11:07.320]  a process of learning just like in life on this level of our spirits experience our souls experience
[1:11:08.040 --> 1:11:12.360]  a three-year-old doesn't know what an 80-year-old knows a 20-year-old doesn't know what a 60-year-old
[1:11:12.360 --> 1:11:20.040]  knows a man will never know what a woman knows a woman will never know what a man knows but
[1:11:20.040 --> 1:11:25.880]  through this level we fuse at the next level that's why the satanists try to create a system
[1:11:26.520 --> 1:11:32.280]  on this level where they fuse man and woman it's an abomination because they've just seen the next
[1:11:32.280 --> 1:11:42.440]  level but still the spirit is male with female now i don't want to get esoteric because you're
[1:11:42.440 --> 1:11:45.080]  not going to get any of this in books you're not going to get any of this in globalist
[1:11:45.080 --> 1:11:48.440]  writings i get any of this in church you're not going to get this in solemn and secret scrolls
[1:11:48.440 --> 1:11:51.160]  you're not going to get this anywhere you're going to get this with a direct connection to God
[1:11:51.160 --> 1:12:00.040]  but let's talk when we come back about specifics now and specifics to lead us out of this evil
[1:12:00.040 --> 1:12:05.480]  and what specific leadership could be executed now that would change the world because we have the
[1:12:05.480 --> 1:12:13.240]  keys to the castle we have the deed to the castle we have the will to open the door to the castle
[1:12:13.240 --> 1:12:19.240]  we have the mind and the soul that once we're in the castle to realize it's not a castle at all
[1:12:20.920 --> 1:12:29.320]  but another dimensional gateway and itself a ship that once you realize this a ship opens up
[1:12:30.120 --> 1:12:36.360]  and is a whole another level of the universe but we'll move past the big trillion mile view
[1:12:36.360 --> 1:12:43.400]  right into the subatomic view on the other side here on terra firma planet earth the year 2020
[1:12:43.400 --> 1:12:48.200]  the year of vision the year of awakening the year of understanding the year of the saintness fear
[1:12:48.200 --> 1:12:54.360]  stay with us i'm going to say something right now that is one of the most important things i've
[1:12:54.360 --> 1:13:01.000]  ever said so please listen very very carefully donald trump is not the reason they released
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:06.520]  covid or had the lockdown they already had this plan the rockefeller foundation and billa melinda
[1:13:06.520 --> 1:13:12.120]  gates it is beyond critical it is life and death for you and your family to understand
[1:13:12.120 --> 1:13:17.880]  no matter where you live on the planet but this is a worldwide world government take over on record
[1:13:18.600 --> 1:13:24.520]  that it's never going to end the united nations has admitted that first it's a month then it's six
[1:13:24.520 --> 1:13:29.800]  months then they say okay it's two years they're now saying two years they're now saying you'll
[1:13:29.800 --> 1:13:35.960]  never go back to normal no more gatherings no more anything constant force inoculations
[1:13:35.960 --> 1:13:42.200]  that they admit don't even work in the way they say they work they change your dna this is the
[1:13:42.200 --> 1:13:47.480]  culling of the planet this is the beginning of the straitjacket being put on you before you're
[1:13:47.480 --> 1:13:54.840]  slowly tortured to death and kill do you understand how do you contest an election in the year 2020
[1:13:54.840 --> 1:14:00.920]  well you trigger race riots and you tell the blue states and blue cities when you're the
[1:14:00.920 --> 1:14:07.000]  speaker of the house that you are legitimately now the president that's what she said on cbs news
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  and that you're going to have those blue states secede yes that's officially called a civil war
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:17.320]  ladies and gentlemen and the democrats are backed by the eu hollywood the chicobs and the whole
[1:14:17.320 --> 1:14:22.920]  globalist system this is treason with a capital t and our federal government is so paralyzed
[1:14:22.920 --> 1:14:27.480]  with cowards they won't even stand up against it and do anything even though our president has
[1:14:27.480 --> 1:14:32.200]  been exposing it but here's the bottom line you need storeable food we've got the best quality
[1:14:32.200 --> 1:14:36.520]  ready to ship to you right now two to four week delivery with 80 days out from the election you
[1:14:36.520 --> 1:14:40.840]  need to get high quality storeable food right now in case they are able to pull this off we're
[1:14:40.840 --> 1:14:44.280]  going to have a great depression war on the streets that will make a road warrior look like a cake
[1:14:44.280 --> 1:14:49.720]  walk your high quality storeable foods now and get ready and get prepared at infowarstore.com get
[1:14:49.720 --> 1:14:57.240]  prepared you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:15:04.040 --> 1:15:09.880]  news analysis reports it's the alex jones show
[1:15:13.080 --> 1:15:19.400]  all right so let's cut right to the chase here leadership now is about understanding
[1:15:19.400 --> 1:15:24.760]  the types of leadership and there's leadership by example there's there's there's there's
[1:15:24.760 --> 1:15:30.680]  leadership by carrying out your duty but if you boil it all down there's leadership of following
[1:15:30.680 --> 1:15:34.760]  other people's directives and so within that system you're leading people to go along with
[1:15:34.760 --> 1:15:42.280]  something else or are you leading people against the system we have to then know what system is
[1:15:42.280 --> 1:15:47.240]  that well there's a global government system coming in and absorbing all the other systems
[1:15:47.240 --> 1:15:54.200]  to create one system so there's no resistance that's an oversimplification and so when you
[1:15:54.200 --> 1:15:58.760]  challenge the dominant system you're going to be censored you're going to be attacked
[1:15:59.880 --> 1:16:03.560]  as christ said you're in the world not up but they're going to come after you
[1:16:05.080 --> 1:16:11.080]  well that's okay because this is an artificial fraudulent corruption being projected over us
[1:16:11.080 --> 1:16:18.600]  that we must defeat it's like not being a fish but you're a mammal and someone grabs you and
[1:16:18.600 --> 1:16:23.640]  plunges you down into 20 feet of water and is holding you there you're going to drown unless
[1:16:23.640 --> 1:16:30.520]  you get back to the oxygen so if you're a grounding man a society held under and everyone knows it's
[1:16:30.520 --> 1:16:36.920]  unhealthy everyone knows it's bad is it leadership to struggle is it leadership to try to pull the
[1:16:36.920 --> 1:16:41.480]  hands off your neck or kick them in the groin to try to get this monster off you so you get back to
[1:16:41.480 --> 1:16:45.880]  the oxygen there's some people might sit there with Stockholm syndrome and say if you just let
[1:16:45.880 --> 1:16:49.720]  this brute who's got scuba tanks and we don't hold us down here at the bottom of the pool
[1:16:50.360 --> 1:16:54.840]  he'll leave us alone he'll be nice till you look over and there's other dead bodies all around you
[1:16:54.840 --> 1:17:00.280]  at the bottom and he's smiling at you and your lights are going to go out soon and he's going to win
[1:17:00.280 --> 1:17:07.240]  so see leadership's realizing there's no leadership at all there's your will to survive
[1:17:07.240 --> 1:17:10.680]  your will to thrive your will to reach out towards god or be a slave
[1:17:14.200 --> 1:17:18.840]  there's the will of making the decision that you're not going to be destroyed that you're
[1:17:18.840 --> 1:17:22.360]  not going to be lied to that you're not going to be passive that you're not going to be weak
[1:17:22.360 --> 1:17:25.720]  that you're not going to be a victim with Stockholm syndrome that you've all been primed to be
[1:17:25.720 --> 1:17:33.080]  to just be feel sorry for yourself and lay down and take it and then there is the leadership of
[1:17:33.080 --> 1:17:38.600]  leading others out of that but by getting them to see what's happened to themselves that's leadership
[1:17:39.960 --> 1:17:45.960]  like the old saying the teacher appears when the student is ready it's going to happen to get so
[1:17:45.960 --> 1:17:52.200]  bad for a lot of people that it'll be too late once the general public wakes up we have to
[1:17:52.200 --> 1:17:58.440]  be leaders early on to turn the ship around so we have a soft landing it's going to already be rough
[1:17:58.440 --> 1:18:05.560]  but not total disaster and so it's simple when you see someone being pilloried someone being
[1:18:05.560 --> 1:18:09.480]  lied about someone being demonized don't run away from them when they're being attacked
[1:18:10.600 --> 1:18:15.960]  support them and champion them because you're championing yourself that's leadership
[1:18:17.240 --> 1:18:21.560]  and everybody knows they're like of course we know that okay well where is it because
[1:18:21.560 --> 1:18:26.280]  you look at america today you have these empty corporations with horrible slave factories around
[1:18:26.280 --> 1:18:31.400]  the world super corrupt paying almost no tax offshore lecturing middle class americans that
[1:18:31.400 --> 1:18:35.880]  they're bad telling us america sucks because they're part of a global combine taking over
[1:18:37.000 --> 1:18:43.560]  so simple leadership would be to declare them a fraud expose them march into their headquarters
[1:18:43.560 --> 1:18:52.920]  yell and scream at them go to their owners houses expose them dump their stock use civil disobedience
[1:18:52.920 --> 1:19:02.680]  and peaceful direct action against them educate them lovingly but with a big stick of truth
[1:19:03.400 --> 1:19:07.320]  and i could go on into leadership for thousands of hours you understand what i'm saying you already
[1:19:07.320 --> 1:19:15.480]  know it why is info wars in 26 years been able to change the world yes you help get trump elected
[1:19:15.480 --> 1:19:19.960]  we help get balsam iro elected his son and his father they're all on record saying at the president
[1:19:19.960 --> 1:19:25.400]  and and and we geisel for us said they the ukip wasn't growing till info wars promoted it 20 years
[1:19:25.400 --> 1:19:31.160]  ago and suddenly they had doubled the numbers because of info wars that was just the truth
[1:19:31.160 --> 1:19:38.920]  the callers the guest the support and the belief that i had and the knowing i had the vision i had
[1:19:38.920 --> 1:19:46.040]  the understanding i had all vision is is seeing a fire on top of hill and you know there's a fire
[1:19:46.040 --> 1:19:50.760]  up on that hill and you climb up that hill and there's the fire vision just means you recognize
[1:19:50.760 --> 1:19:56.520]  what it is and i knew their world government was real i knew it was anti-human i knew it was horrible
[1:19:56.520 --> 1:20:01.640]  i knew it would be rejected but would it be rejected by ragtag groups that didn't know
[1:20:01.640 --> 1:20:06.680]  what was going on when they realized it was too late or would we get ahead of the game but what
[1:20:06.680 --> 1:20:10.840]  would happen if we did that we'd be boycott it we'd be attacked we'd be laughed at we'd be
[1:20:10.840 --> 1:20:17.320]  ridiculed we'd be sued they try to put us in jail they try to kill us but that's okay because like
[1:20:17.320 --> 1:20:26.280]  zapata said it's better to live on your feet for a couple days longer and take out your enemy
[1:20:26.280 --> 1:20:31.080]  than die a thousand deaths on your knees there were longer speeches he gave and others have given
[1:20:31.080 --> 1:20:35.640]  so much before him and after him but it's better to die on your feet than live on your knees
[1:20:37.000 --> 1:20:43.960]  and that's what this comes down to and it's the decision to not cower and not be a slave that
[1:20:43.960 --> 1:20:49.880]  produces the good government and the good culture and the good society of honor and strength and will
[1:20:49.880 --> 1:20:55.720]  and non-conformity with tyranny because you then have a set of values and understanding
[1:20:55.720 --> 1:21:01.560]  that come from god that resonate through you that you implement and you execute here in the third
[1:21:01.560 --> 1:21:09.400]  dimension so that's leadership you've got to have knowledge you've got to have morals you've got to
[1:21:09.400 --> 1:21:14.440]  have will you've got to have action you've got to understand that you're working for the collective
[1:21:14.440 --> 1:21:18.600]  but you never give up your individual will it's your decisions that work towards the collective
[1:21:18.600 --> 1:21:27.960]  and all of that is driven by god's spirit like wind and sails and if you have that the universe
[1:21:27.960 --> 1:21:33.320]  will open up everything will become clear but as the bible says the beginning of knowledge comes
[1:21:33.320 --> 1:21:43.880]  great sorrow opening up the blast wave of this information is very intense and so a lot of people
[1:21:43.880 --> 1:21:49.720]  can't handle it and that's okay they're not leaders they're what christ called the children
[1:21:50.680 --> 1:21:57.240]  and you have to then stand up and be strong and you have to lead them and guide them and direct
[1:21:57.240 --> 1:22:03.560]  them through free will and through love you know it's our failure that there are so many
[1:22:03.560 --> 1:22:07.800]  throngs of satanists running around thumbing at the mouth like zombies they are zombies they don't
[1:22:07.800 --> 1:22:13.080]  have god's spirit in them at all they're cut off it's our fault the left is so stupid to so dumb
[1:22:13.080 --> 1:22:18.040]  down that they've had decades of you know generations of fluoride and vaccines and tv and
[1:22:18.040 --> 1:22:23.000]  soullessness and confusion and not knowing who they are they're programmed it's our failure we
[1:22:23.000 --> 1:22:28.920]  laugh at them we revel in it it's a joke to us that they're fallen these are our fellow humans
[1:22:28.920 --> 1:22:36.360]  that have been taken by the enemy and leadership means that you recognize that you're fouled that
[1:22:36.360 --> 1:22:43.160]  you're fallen that you have problems and that it's wrong but you still enjoy laughing at them that's
[1:22:43.160 --> 1:22:48.920]  not a hypocrisy that's the fallen nature of us the knowledge of good and evil we have before we
[1:22:48.920 --> 1:22:55.960]  were pure we had only the knowledge of good until we took the virus of evil and now we have the
[1:22:55.960 --> 1:23:01.160]  knowledge of evil and so we have evil in us and we get off on evil and we resonate with evil and
[1:23:01.160 --> 1:23:08.360]  we enjoy evil i mean i have a duality that's much smaller than my true self of an understanding i
[1:23:08.360 --> 1:23:14.280]  can see what the satanists want i know what they want i can smell it i can i can tune into it
[1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:21.400]  and there was a time i liked it not not the not the not the sacraments of it but just the raw
[1:23:21.400 --> 1:23:28.040]  rebellious energy of it but as time goes on that is totally out of my life and i don't like it at all
[1:23:28.040 --> 1:23:34.440]  and it disgusts me but i still can see into it and i can tune into it to know what the enemy's up to
[1:23:35.240 --> 1:23:41.320]  because it's important to have a vision to understand what the enemy's doing so leadership's
[1:23:41.320 --> 1:23:44.760]  about doing the right thing you're gonna be attacked knowing the long run it's better for
[1:23:44.760 --> 1:24:01.880]  everybody and it's better to die on your feet the answer to 1984 is 1776
[1:24:03.560 --> 1:24:08.520]  info wars has been banned arrested
[1:24:08.520 --> 1:24:19.720]  attacked and threatened because we are effective the great awakening is here
[1:24:19.720 --> 1:24:30.280]  go to band.video download the videos and share support the information war at infowarstore.com
[1:24:30.280 --> 1:24:39.080]  and never give up the fight
[1:24:44.760 --> 1:24:47.080]  infowar.com
[1:24:48.600 --> 1:24:56.040]  the new world order is a planetary corporate plan for world government but world government is only
[1:24:56.040 --> 1:25:03.000]  the control grid now inner members of the cult are told that they are going to transcend and become
[1:25:03.000 --> 1:25:09.240]  gods and attain immortality but the price for that is to carry out the orderly extermination
[1:25:09.240 --> 1:25:15.880]  of all carbon based line forms that's why they say carbon is bad they are rewriting the entire
[1:25:15.880 --> 1:25:22.600]  genetic code of the planet they are playing god they believe they have been inspired by
[1:25:22.600 --> 1:25:29.800]  interdimensional entities that are giving them advanced technology to carry out this transformation
[1:25:29.800 --> 1:25:35.160]  i know this sounds insane but if you read the writings of the globalist it's all on record
[1:25:35.160 --> 1:25:42.600]  you have been warned you have been given the information to say no to this plan this is the
[1:25:42.600 --> 1:25:49.320]  end of all life on earth as we know it this is the alien takeover of earth when the corrupt
[1:25:49.320 --> 1:25:55.880]  establishment began pushing joe biden two years ago they knew he had serious cognitive problems
[1:25:55.880 --> 1:26:00.840]  he has always been an empty suit that does what he's told by the globalist and their
[1:26:00.840 --> 1:26:06.280]  allied crime syndicates kamala harris is even worse than does whatever she's told she's bought
[1:26:06.280 --> 1:26:13.640]  and paid for by silicon valley the chai comms and others so she has been chosen because she's part
[1:26:13.640 --> 1:26:20.520]  african and now anyone that criticizes her will be called a racist and evil and she is now above
[1:26:20.520 --> 1:26:27.560]  reproach ladies and gentlemen we must expose this monster for who she is we must expose the fact
[1:26:27.560 --> 1:26:33.240]  that she wanted minimum sentences for black people three times longer than white people that the woman
[1:26:33.240 --> 1:26:39.560]  is a monster kamala harris will end up being our president if they're able to steal the election
[1:26:39.560 --> 1:26:46.600]  and she is a 110 new world order puppet now more than ever we must expose this monster we must
[1:26:46.600 --> 1:27:05.480]  expose the globalist you're listening to the alex jones show rallying patriots worldwide in defense
[1:27:05.480 --> 1:27:21.560]  of human liberty it's alex jones you know fox bright bart sin claire and alex jones which has
[1:27:21.560 --> 1:27:28.120]  now been taken off the facebook thank god uh you know trafficking in another narrative
[1:27:28.120 --> 1:27:36.360]  we are in it right now it might be the last stage of a civil war the last battle is being fought
[1:27:36.360 --> 1:27:42.280]  hopefully it won't be fought physically but we are more divided than we ever have been and we've
[1:27:42.280 --> 1:27:51.080]  got a president who is backed up by media the presidents have always spewed propaganda liberals
[1:27:51.080 --> 1:27:58.040]  democrats republic they always have everyone's been yeah to push a policy to push a rationale to go
[1:27:58.040 --> 1:28:04.040]  to war but they've never been backed up by essentially incensed state-run media that's new
[1:28:05.080 --> 1:28:09.720]  and social media it's all new and uh it's very very scary right now
[1:28:12.680 --> 1:28:16.360]  people don't want to hear the facts about the president and seems or at least john trump
[1:28:16.360 --> 1:28:20.440]  supporters don't want to hear the facts a lot of them tune us out won't believe a single thing
[1:28:20.440 --> 1:28:25.640]  that we say they'll believe what he says over us which is you know propaganda when you don't have
[1:28:25.640 --> 1:28:30.760]  somebody to to push back or fact check or correct the spin or they'll believe their friends and
[1:28:30.760 --> 1:28:34.440]  family but they're not going to believe the media even if the media is comporting with what they're
[1:28:34.440 --> 1:28:39.560]  seeing with their own eyes yeah um the washington post has been keeping a running fact checker if
[1:28:39.560 --> 1:28:47.960]  you will of the president's um the way he speaks and and they've just updated it 4229 false or
[1:28:47.960 --> 1:28:55.400]  misleading claims in 558 days and seven and a half claims a day in just june and july
[1:28:55.400 --> 1:29:03.240]  that's 16 lies or falsehoods or misleading claims a day yeah and that is the biggest problem i see
[1:29:03.240 --> 1:29:09.640]  with because i think of it as two mainstream medias you have you know washington post new york
[1:29:09.640 --> 1:29:16.120]  times all the networks except for fox working very hard to get the truth out to be fair there are some
[1:29:16.120 --> 1:29:21.640]  really genuinely very good journalists at fox who yes i'm genuinely good journalist yes they're you
[1:29:21.640 --> 1:29:28.280]  know look at henry's interview with scott absolutely and and uh uh you know we've got shepard smith i mean
[1:29:28.280 --> 1:29:34.920]  there are good journalists there but this is the first time that you have uh mainstream media
[1:29:34.920 --> 1:29:42.440]  essentially divided into two halves so that you have uh you know fox bright bart sin claire and
[1:29:42.440 --> 1:29:49.000]  alex jones which has now been taken off the facebook thank god uh you know trafficking in
[1:29:49.000 --> 1:29:56.040]  another narrative and so you know when we shock and all with these guys the four journalists who
[1:29:56.040 --> 1:30:04.200]  got the truth out during the run up to the war they were facing headwinds of patriotism the trauma of
[1:30:04.200 --> 1:30:09.480]  9 11 hit boss but they weren't fake i wanted to air this rob ronner from a few years ago because
[1:30:09.480 --> 1:30:13.480]  he talks about we're gonna have a civil war and that's what they've been engineering the whole time
[1:30:13.480 --> 1:30:21.000]  here's a meathead this lying communist worth 500 million dollars up there saying trump controls
[1:30:21.000 --> 1:30:28.440]  the media when the study showed 92 to 97 percent is anti-trump and going on and saying oh they're
[1:30:28.440 --> 1:30:35.080]  challenging our narrative they listen to their families oh they talk about no self-awareness
[1:30:35.080 --> 1:30:44.760]  it's like seeing in fact checking trump dearing his speeches now at the rnc and lying about that
[1:30:44.760 --> 1:30:50.680]  because we know you're a pack of liars so instead of stopping the lies or cutting back they just
[1:30:50.680 --> 1:30:58.200]  tell bigger ones here's an example six months ago alex jones loses sandy hook lawsuit ordered to
[1:30:58.200 --> 1:31:09.080]  pay 400 000 dollars wall street journal new york times ap cnn and then it was this lawsuit against
[1:31:09.080 --> 1:31:15.720]  jim fetzer professor in wisconsin about a book he wrote i was not sued i'm not in the suit and all
[1:31:15.720 --> 1:31:20.680]  the time i just opened the paper up and it's completely not true you understand folks i don't
[1:31:20.680 --> 1:31:29.960]  mean just partly not true completely not true and that's how these people operate but there's some
[1:31:29.960 --> 1:31:34.360]  really good news i haven't gotten to yet i'm going to get to we have a guest popping in he got banned
[1:31:34.360 --> 1:31:39.880]  on delta because he was wearing a trump mask that's really why it happened the honorable rain
[1:31:39.880 --> 1:31:44.040]  took a few days off flew to see some friends in florida she'll be joining us next segment
[1:31:44.040 --> 1:31:47.320]  well let's finish up with old meathead from a few years ago here he is
[1:31:47.320 --> 1:31:54.600]  is it warrant facing the headwinds that real journalists who are working very hard now to
[1:31:54.600 --> 1:32:02.120]  get the truth at which is this cement block a wall that they cannot penetrate with the truth
[1:32:02.120 --> 1:32:07.800]  and that's the scary part that's don't show brand on this and it was effective he said that you
[1:32:07.800 --> 1:32:12.280]  know the media doesn't represent regular people hollywood doesn't write represent regular people
[1:32:12.280 --> 1:32:17.000]  we are completely out of touch with regular people and it worked to his advantage how do you
[1:32:17.000 --> 1:32:22.040]  how is somebody who who speaks the media often as someone who produces films like shock and
[1:32:22.040 --> 1:32:28.120]  awe that are that are journalism films but then also somebody you just have to keep
[1:32:28.120 --> 1:32:34.920]  pounding away there's nothing else you can do i mean hit pause again all over europe all over
[1:32:34.920 --> 1:32:40.680]  the united states major universities are saying you will not leave the campus during covet 19 you
[1:32:40.680 --> 1:32:44.680]  will have apps on your phones if you do you'll get suspended or expelled and we're going to tell you
[1:32:44.680 --> 1:32:49.800]  where you can go and what you can do while you're on campus i mean that's beyond 1984 but that's
[1:32:49.800 --> 1:32:55.000]  their answer oh you're trying to leave the cold we're gonna lock your ass up in the barn so he
[1:32:55.000 --> 1:33:01.880]  says you pound away well now they even censored the president's tweets and lie about it so they're
[1:33:01.880 --> 1:33:05.400]  not going to stop they're just going to keep strangling and strangling and strangling and
[1:33:05.400 --> 1:33:09.400]  obviously it's only going to make people angrier but they don't care they're not going to stop
[1:33:09.400 --> 1:33:14.840]  so it's the immovable object comes into the unstoppable force and it's going to be explosive
[1:33:14.840 --> 1:33:20.200]  like when you clap uranium and plutonium together you get a you get a thermonuclear explosion
[1:33:21.400 --> 1:33:26.920]  let's hear a little bit more from me dead what how do you push back on that you just have to keep
[1:33:26.920 --> 1:33:33.880]  pounding away there there's nothing else you can do i mean look he doesn't speak to the mainstream
[1:33:33.880 --> 1:33:40.600]  media they they're just angry their people are angry and he will feed them whatever they want
[1:33:40.600 --> 1:33:46.680]  to keep that anger going and you see it in the rallies he actually calls for you know this kind
[1:33:46.680 --> 1:33:51.880]  of outraged and take it out against the media take it out against immigrants take it out against
[1:33:51.880 --> 1:34:01.000]  whomever you want i can't listen to this lying hollywood scum anymore that's the left calling
[1:34:01.000 --> 1:34:05.080]  for violence and destruction it's trump calling for unity he does point out the media are a bunch
[1:34:05.080 --> 1:34:12.600]  of liars because they are so more inversion by an old corrupt guy worth 500 million dollars last
[1:34:12.600 --> 1:34:17.080]  time i checked telling you he's a good commie he's gonna take good care of you um here's what we
[1:34:17.080 --> 1:34:22.600]  don't believe rob reiner we know they're using everybody that dies of other diseases or car
[1:34:22.600 --> 1:34:29.560]  wrecks or gunshot wounds as covid deaths we know that they're throwing it in the face 180 000 deaths
[1:34:29.560 --> 1:34:34.200]  all trumps fault they're running on that while saying trumps about gloom and doom when trumps
[1:34:34.200 --> 1:34:38.200]  going most of its old people that died it's still sad we've got a lot of drugs that treat it
[1:34:39.240 --> 1:34:43.960]  is it a real virus yet it's super weak it spreads really fast so everyone's to blame
[1:34:44.520 --> 1:34:49.880]  so everyone gets infected and it's the hysteria over the infection and the economy never opens
[1:34:49.880 --> 1:34:55.720]  again and the globalists moving their businesses and the industry to china win this is 21st century
[1:34:55.720 --> 1:35:03.560]  war period and i said trump needs to level with the people on this there's a big article by kit
[1:35:03.560 --> 1:35:09.320]  manuals on info wars dot com that needs to go mega viral if you want to defeat these tyrants
[1:35:09.320 --> 1:35:13.160]  collin county's up there with plain oh it's a suburb of dallas a couple million people live there
[1:35:13.800 --> 1:35:19.800]  major institution they were the first one that put out if you remember four months ago
[1:35:19.800 --> 1:35:25.400]  we've been given directives to say that if one person has covid we count 15 more by law
[1:35:26.600 --> 1:35:31.960]  this is going to cause a huge spike and it did cause the huge spike it's fake well now they've
[1:35:31.960 --> 1:35:39.560]  put out the dashboard they're given and they've gone over the numbers and it turns out texas
[1:35:39.560 --> 1:35:47.240]  county drops from 4600 active covid cases you under 100 after audit and that's why you suddenly hear
[1:35:47.240 --> 1:35:52.840]  covid numbers are plunging everywhere covid and the media goes oh trump took over the numbers
[1:35:52.840 --> 1:36:00.440]  he's he's fraudulently lowering them he won't say if you have symptoms you have covid that's
[1:36:00.440 --> 1:36:09.560]  because in their diagnostic the NIH started doing in early may they say that if you have a cough
[1:36:09.560 --> 1:36:13.320]  or the sniffles you have covid that's why you show up the treatment center they go oh we'll
[1:36:13.320 --> 1:36:20.360]  even test you you got it and then they count 15 people around you as having total fraud so they
[1:36:20.360 --> 1:36:26.360]  had thousands of clinics with thousands of tests were 100 percent have covid they're not testing it
[1:36:26.360 --> 1:36:31.080]  they're just saying and getting the money you don't have thousands of clinics all over the country
[1:36:31.080 --> 1:36:37.560]  with 100 percent positives and it turns out the nfl all the nfl players they said had it they
[1:36:37.560 --> 1:36:43.800]  retested they didn't have it so the fraud is going down folks it's happening right now that's amazing
[1:36:43.800 --> 1:36:53.160]  praise god the democrats are just going more and more left many positive about socialism liking
[1:36:53.160 --> 1:36:59.480]  it more than capitalism many of the ideas we fought for that were considered radical are now

[1:41:24.280 --> 1:41:29.960]  days off visit some friends in florida before she went out to california got her stuff and moved to
[1:41:29.960 --> 1:41:35.240]  texas to co-host shows with us here knocking out of the park folks love her we love her she's smart

[1:41:40.680 --> 1:41:44.280]  that's been throwing all these people off for not wearing mask or not wearing them properly
[1:41:44.280 --> 1:41:49.560]  she falls asleep with her trump mask and looks like a another case of trump derangement syndrome
[1:41:49.560 --> 1:41:55.480]  the woman said i'm putting you on the list you'll be banned and she was so the petty power of these
[1:41:55.480 --> 1:42:02.680]  authoritarian communist style chai com social credit scores is here and it's all about the
[1:42:02.680 --> 1:42:09.160]  virtues signaling and they never planned to let the mask go away foutsy said that gates has said
[1:42:09.160 --> 1:42:14.440]  that because it's about your subservience just like an islam to their cult sharia laws here for
[1:42:14.440 --> 1:42:18.600]  men and women who don't believe that a year ago and so why this is so important is it's
[1:42:18.600 --> 1:42:27.400]  come been confirmed that all over the country 99 of the cover cases are fake texas county drops from
[1:42:27.400 --> 1:42:34.280]  4600 active cases to under 100 after audit when trump changed it where you can't say one person
[1:42:34.280 --> 1:42:39.080]  has it so 15 more have it then they claim those around them have it they call on the phone and
[1:42:39.080 --> 1:42:44.120]  say hey you got the sniffles yeah oh you got it that's in the in the fouchy plan to have the big
[1:42:44.120 --> 1:42:48.680]  spike remember it's not about deaths now about the number everybody's got it uh what the warehouse has
[1:42:48.680 --> 1:42:54.120]  got one person that has a sniffle shut everything down and the economy goes down we blame trump
[1:42:55.080 --> 1:42:59.560]  but the honorable rain is here let's play some of the footage i heard just uh well introduced
[1:42:59.560 --> 1:43:04.040]  this footage for us and i didn't know you'd be back till uh you know uh next week but no you're
[1:43:04.040 --> 1:43:11.080]  here with us now so tell us what unfolded so what happened was i'm on a flight to delta to get to
[1:43:11.080 --> 1:43:15.640]  florida you know from austin to florida just a few hours and you think i would be able to just take
[1:43:15.640 --> 1:43:20.760]  a flight in peace at this point so i'm taking a flight and i was exhausted alex like i got like
[1:43:20.760 --> 1:43:25.640]  two hours of sleep the night before i just couldn't really sleep so i was knocked out okay and i was
[1:43:25.640 --> 1:43:30.280]  wearing my mask and i'm one of those girls you know me that i don't like to wear a mask i'm very
[1:43:30.280 --> 1:43:35.400]  anti-mask but uh you know i just need to sometimes get from point a to point b and i wasn't wanting to
[1:43:35.400 --> 1:43:39.880]  just get you know the hassle of kicked off the flight and all that so i just complied and i wore
[1:43:39.880 --> 1:43:47.000]  this mask so i wore my trump 2020 mask and it goes over your neck and it goes over your face right
[1:43:47.000 --> 1:43:51.480]  so it's you know there's no way that it can just be off it was over my whole thing and everything
[1:43:51.480 --> 1:43:56.280]  so i fall asleep with it over my nose like a good little girl because i didn't want to just
[1:43:56.280 --> 1:44:01.720]  cause any trouble and i fall asleep less next thing i know about two hours later you know about
[1:44:01.720 --> 1:44:09.400]  20 minutes to landing i get woken up by this uh individual who looks like megan rapapo uh a flight
[1:44:09.400 --> 1:44:14.520]  attendant with a shaved head screaming at me saying you need to put your mask on this is the
[1:44:14.520 --> 1:44:18.600]  second time i've told you you need to put your mask on and i'm looking to see like i'm like well
[1:44:18.600 --> 1:44:23.640]  it's on and she said it's it was below your nose it fell below your nose and she started screaming
[1:44:23.640 --> 1:44:28.120]  at me making a big scene in the flight and i said look you know when you feel like when someone
[1:44:28.120 --> 1:44:33.160]  violently wakes you up it feels like you're completely disoriented and confused in the first
[1:44:33.160 --> 1:44:39.080]  place which i was but secondly i said look i i didn't know you know obviously i was really asleep
[1:44:39.080 --> 1:44:43.480]  and knocked out if you came in and bothered me before about it i'm sorry yeah these airlines
[1:44:43.480 --> 1:44:46.920]  are trying to make two-year-old babies wear them it's all about abuse and dominance i mean they're
[1:44:46.920 --> 1:44:53.560]  raping them yeah exactly and then she says i'm filing report i'm filing report on you for lack
[1:44:53.560 --> 1:44:58.840]  of compliance and you're gonna be banned from ever flying delta again i said wait are you serious so
[1:44:58.840 --> 1:45:04.280]  because i was sleeping and i didn't realize my mask slipped below my nose now i'm gonna be banned from
[1:45:04.280 --> 1:45:08.760]  delta i've been a customer for years and she said yes you're gonna be banned from delta
[1:45:08.760 --> 1:45:14.840]  and i said so there's no talking my way there's no explanation or anything forget customer service
[1:45:14.840 --> 1:45:19.720]  right no there's no talking so i went at the end she said she's gonna file the complaint and as
[1:45:19.720 --> 1:45:25.960]  people are leaving i recorded some footage of it and and as you can see i mean she was she was very
[1:45:25.960 --> 1:45:31.080]  obstinate and she said she she didn't came at me with her guitar it almost looked like she was like
[1:45:31.080 --> 1:45:35.800]  trying to use it as a weapon or something was kind of creepy but she was very very hostile
[1:45:35.800 --> 1:45:39.800]  towards me and she said nope you're gonna be banned from delta there's no way you're coming back
[1:45:39.800 --> 1:45:44.440]  because of this she said i i already woke you up once you didn't listen so the second time you're
[1:45:44.440 --> 1:45:49.240]  banned i can't believe it alex you know i i can't believe this is the social credit score it's gonna
[1:45:49.240 --> 1:45:53.720]  start at the airports it's gonna fan out and then you gotta have the inoculation you've gotta have
[1:45:53.720 --> 1:45:58.120]  the digital tattoo to even get on planes they admit this is the plan so these corporations
[1:45:58.120 --> 1:46:03.160]  that are globalists are empowering their people delta needs to be punished along with sky blue
[1:46:03.160 --> 1:46:09.000]  everyone needs to boycott them you need to let them know hashtag boycott delta hashtag boycott sky
[1:46:09.000 --> 1:46:13.640]  blue and let other groups know you're gonna not have our business if you do this we have to do
[1:46:13.640 --> 1:46:18.200]  it up front to stop the global social credit score here's some of the footage that you smartly got

[1:47:12.120 --> 1:47:16.600]  well so when i when i when i'm sleeping it fell off so what am i supposed to do you're arguing with me
[1:47:16.600 --> 1:47:21.640]  now as well but i'm trying to not get a report so you're getting this on you're getting one
[1:47:21.640 --> 1:47:25.240]  because you're continuing to argue with me no i'm trying to explain my point is this arguing
[1:47:25.960 --> 1:47:31.720]  so explaining what happened is arguing i saw it playing two eyes twice well i was sleeping
[1:47:31.720 --> 1:47:39.240]  my eyes were closed right so i can't even explain the point without you you saw me take off the
[1:47:39.240 --> 1:47:44.200]  mouse i hope you look twice and ask you put it on you start arguing with me you're arguing with me
[1:47:44.200 --> 1:47:50.680]  now so i'm not allowed to fly arguing you don't talk back as a prisoner judge jury executioner
[1:47:50.680 --> 1:47:55.000]  all of it's about control can't criticize covid lockdown your band off the internet
[1:47:55.000 --> 1:47:58.600]  can't have medical doctors criticizing the fraud numbers your band off the internet
[1:47:58.600 --> 1:48:06.120]  can't talk back to this god uh right what really happened and she said i woke you up
[1:48:06.120 --> 1:48:11.160]  twice so the first time so we can't even sleep peacefully clearly i'm sleeping she knows i'm
[1:48:11.160 --> 1:48:15.240]  sleeping and you're kind of not conscious when you're sleeping so the nose was you know the
[1:48:15.240 --> 1:48:19.640]  mask was below my nose apparently when i was sleeping or it fell off uh unburnt my nose but
[1:48:19.640 --> 1:48:24.280]  as you can see it still wraps around my whole face and she said i don't show it doesn't protect
[1:48:24.280 --> 1:48:30.520]  anybody it's all a fraud it's all another evil industry that supports black lives matter garbage
[1:48:30.520 --> 1:48:34.520]  these corporations are filth and they're setting up a world government these corporations want to
[1:48:34.520 --> 1:48:39.960]  be government you think the cops are bad folks oh my god in fact you were here in austin downtown
[1:48:39.960 --> 1:48:44.680]  and saw the four police cars go after a woman who wasn't properly wearing a mask in a in a
[1:48:44.680 --> 1:48:49.720]  business so black lives matter and if i've been burning the city shooting people but oh here come
[1:48:49.720 --> 1:48:55.800]  the cops it's disgusting it is and remember too that they have this high-powered mister thing now
[1:48:55.800 --> 1:49:02.920]  at planes that supposedly sanitizes 99.9 of germs it's like this mister thing they do it before
[1:49:02.920 --> 1:49:08.280]  after and during the plane ride so if that's sanitized is 99.9 of germs in the plane why
[1:49:08.280 --> 1:49:12.440]  do we even need masks to begin with i mean it's just a joke and why do we need masks anywhere
[1:49:12.440 --> 1:49:19.320]  to begin with the honor it's all virtue signaling with the fake death numbers it's point 0032 and
[1:49:19.320 --> 1:49:23.400]  now we know it's all fraud that they're just taking every death and hyping up each person
[1:49:23.400 --> 1:49:29.240]  of some other death to do this it's all a giant scam right and now now i can't fly on delta anymore
[1:49:29.240 --> 1:49:33.240]  i mean this is the most it's okay so it's not enough to wear a mask anymore you have to wear it
[1:49:33.240 --> 1:49:37.240]  and make sure that if you're sleeping you're checking you're sleeping and make sure that it's
[1:49:37.240 --> 1:49:41.800]  not falling and out of place oh the next thing is you've got to wear the approved mask they're
[1:49:41.800 --> 1:49:47.400]  coming out with that soon right exactly and you know it's it's they're tightening the ratchet every
[1:49:47.400 --> 1:49:51.720]  single day you know what i know that this is not just enough to say okay we're going to wear the
[1:49:51.720 --> 1:49:56.280]  mask and everything's going to go away like you know peaches and roses no they're going to keep
[1:49:56.280 --> 1:50:00.520]  tightening and tighten it next is going to be a vaccine next is going to be a digital tattoo
[1:50:00.520 --> 1:50:06.440]  or microchip it's just going to keep going and if people aren't awake right now to how much of a
[1:50:06.440 --> 1:50:12.200]  Gestapo this is and and just regular staff waiters and and stewardesses are turning into
[1:50:12.200 --> 1:50:16.440]  they better wake the hell up and see videos like this i want people if they have an experience
[1:50:16.440 --> 1:50:21.320]  like this go to my twitter at diana for congress post your experience because boycott delta is
[1:50:21.320 --> 1:50:26.200]  getting trending right now um and and we want to make an example out of this they can't treat
[1:50:26.200 --> 1:50:30.840]  customers like this they can't betray people's constitutional rights over this and it's all
[1:50:30.840 --> 1:50:34.920]  based on a fraud when people go to the airport they should hand out at delta terminals little
[1:50:34.920 --> 1:50:39.400]  sheets explaining it's all a hoax it's all a fraud because they're already telling school districts
[1:50:39.400 --> 1:50:44.360]  diana they're already telling uh colleges you don't have the vaccine you don't go to college
[1:50:44.360 --> 1:50:47.320]  you don't go to school uh governor northings announced that they're they're coming with
[1:50:47.320 --> 1:50:52.360]  force inoculations next they are alex honestly that would be something i'd get arrested over for
[1:50:52.360 --> 1:50:56.680]  you guys i would go to the airports and hand out little flyers saying this all as a hoax and get
[1:50:56.680 --> 1:51:01.240]  carried away um because people need to make an example out of this and people need to learn
[1:51:01.240 --> 1:51:06.520]  that this is not you know we can't live our life and if nobody flies on planes if we all boycott
[1:51:06.520 --> 1:51:09.480]  this then what are they going to do are they going to finally realize they're getting hit by the
[1:51:09.480 --> 1:51:14.360]  pocketbooks i mean notice it was first the chinese spring all their people and now we've got to be

[1:52:50.520 --> 1:52:56.280]  different types of civilizations and countries and political systems of history and at the present
[1:52:56.280 --> 1:53:05.400]  are mixes of the two but with globalism it is a post-human ideology so it's scientifically
[1:53:05.400 --> 1:53:11.880]  geared to be oppressive and the rationale is social Darwinism that the ruling class
[1:53:11.880 --> 1:53:17.960]  are elites and because they're in power they have a right to rule over you poison you dumb you down
[1:53:17.960 --> 1:53:23.640]  sterilize you and kill you so all the people wearing masks like outside at the park and stuff
[1:53:24.280 --> 1:53:29.720]  are living in a total hoax and think their act of submission is an act of working for the common
[1:53:29.720 --> 1:53:35.240]  good in a collective no it's a sign that you're a slave who will take the force inoculations
[1:53:35.240 --> 1:53:38.520]  federal government and Yale are studying the force inoculations right now
[1:53:38.520 --> 1:53:48.360]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:53:51.640 --> 1:53:54.360]  the answer to globalist tyranny is resistance
[1:53:57.880 --> 1:54:06.040]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:54:06.040 --> 1:54:11.640]  the system is clamping down the jaws of the globalist are hitting hard
[1:54:12.520 --> 1:54:18.040]  the games are over the war is on you know Lorraine i'm pretty excited bring anger
[1:54:18.040 --> 1:54:22.280]  but run over your last segment you're on fire great job exposing all of this for the next
[1:54:22.280 --> 1:54:26.040]  five minutes we have left you've got the floor what else you want to say about this about
[1:54:26.040 --> 1:54:31.480]  hashtag boycott delta that i know you're driving how do people get behind this how do we stand up
[1:54:31.480 --> 1:54:37.400]  to these thugs that are pushing this power grab hoax yeah i mean you have to be exposing it any
[1:54:37.400 --> 1:54:43.480]  of these little stories that happen um dme or or post it on my twitter or or send it to info wars
[1:54:43.480 --> 1:54:47.400]  or do all of the above because we need to expose this more and more we need to make examples out
[1:54:47.400 --> 1:54:52.440]  of these people someone just wrote into me um on this boycott delta thread that said that
[1:54:52.440 --> 1:54:57.720]  his girlfriend was kicked off a flight yesterday for having asthma and she dared to take off her
[1:54:57.720 --> 1:55:02.920]  mask for a few minutes to try to use her inhaler and delta kicked her off the flight they wouldn't
[1:55:02.920 --> 1:55:08.680]  even let her use her inhaler i mean this is getting beyond crazy the other possibility is maybe she
[1:55:08.680 --> 1:55:12.680]  was seeing that this was a trump mask and she was just out to get me she was trying to find any
[1:55:12.680 --> 1:55:17.960]  little thing wrong so that she could make an example out of me because she hates trump uh and
[1:55:17.960 --> 1:55:21.240]  it looked basically i don't know i'm not trying to be discriminatory but she kind of looks like she
[1:55:21.240 --> 1:55:25.320]  might be someone who doesn't like trump but that's even more disgusting i mean we can't go anywhere
[1:55:25.320 --> 1:55:29.960]  now with having without having this kind of discrimination so when finally delta wrote back
[1:55:29.960 --> 1:55:34.360]  to me after seeing that their you know hashtag people are tweeting their hashtags they finally i
[1:55:34.360 --> 1:55:38.920]  don't know if you have this tweet but they answered me and i i retweeted it they said uh
[1:55:38.920 --> 1:55:45.480]  dear diana we're sorry to hear about your mask compliance issue send us more details and we'll
[1:55:45.480 --> 1:55:50.760]  see what happened we'll investigate further so already i mean this this shows you that this
[1:55:50.760 --> 1:55:57.320]  isn't about a mask or safety mask compliance issue they're making it so it's my fault right this is
[1:55:57.320 --> 1:56:02.120]  my problem i obviously wasn't complying or there was some problem with me not being a good little
[1:56:02.120 --> 1:56:06.600]  sheep and that's the issue don't you think basically on that language that that's what they're meaning
[1:56:07.400 --> 1:56:12.680]  so this isn't about us this isn't about our safety our health this is about all about compliance
[1:56:12.680 --> 1:56:17.400]  you know it i know it so what are we gonna do we need to make an example out of these people we
[1:56:17.400 --> 1:56:23.080]  need to boycott them we need to film always have your phone ready to film when you're about to take
[1:56:23.080 --> 1:56:26.920]  a flight when you're in an airport when you're in a restaurant because a lot of these things
[1:56:26.920 --> 1:56:31.320]  happen really quickly and i've noticed for me you know they happen so fast we have to be ready
[1:56:31.320 --> 1:56:36.200]  with our phones to film um you know try to do it subtly so they don't get it because if they know
[1:56:36.200 --> 1:56:40.360]  they're being filmed they're gonna act more polite we want to see their true colors right we got to
[1:56:40.360 --> 1:56:46.920]  see uh their true vile satanic nature coming out and this woman didn't know i was filming so uh
[1:56:46.920 --> 1:56:51.400]  we just have to make an example out of these people we have to fight back or else look at what
[1:56:51.400 --> 1:56:55.880]  they're going to do they're gonna take advantage of us and they're treating us like animals they're
[1:56:55.880 --> 1:56:59.960]  treating us like livestock right i mean worse than livestock but they're they're treating us like
[1:56:59.960 --> 1:57:04.360]  animals and they're having free reign and every day that goes by that we don't fight back they're
[1:57:04.360 --> 1:57:12.760]  getting more and more emboldened amen to that keep keep rolling you keep telling them right so um
[1:57:12.760 --> 1:57:20.120]  you know right into alex call into alex uh in info wars right into me uh go to my twitter diana
[1:57:20.120 --> 1:57:26.760]  for congress we're gonna be covering this so this is not gonna end this is not gonna get better this
[1:57:26.760 --> 1:57:30.760]  is only going to get worse so every day there's gonna be more stories like this that compile and
[1:57:30.760 --> 1:57:34.520]  we want to highlight them you know we want to highlight them we want to make an example out of
[1:57:34.520 --> 1:57:38.680]  them your voice is going to be heard and some people don't have a very big platform like the guy
[1:57:38.680 --> 1:57:42.440]  who wrote in that got his girlfriend kicked off the flight that's fine that's why you want to
[1:57:42.440 --> 1:57:47.720]  send it to us so that we can highlight them because this is global tyranny this has nothing to do
[1:57:47.720 --> 1:57:51.320]  with our health and safety it has nothing to do with our health and safety when we have people
[1:57:51.320 --> 1:57:58.920]  like and and your skype's breaking up while it reconnects let me just say this what should we

[2:00:15.400 --> 2:00:20.360]  consciously were there to uh demonize him and other young people but it blew up in their evil
[2:00:20.360 --> 2:00:26.280]  faces and one of the guys involved in championing uh the covington catholic school kids is here with
[2:00:26.280 --> 2:00:33.640]  us ali alexander visiting us in studio again but here's some what he had to say at the rnc
[2:00:33.640 --> 2:00:40.040]  good evening everyone my name is nick sandman and i'm the teenager who is defamed by the media
[2:00:40.040 --> 2:00:44.600]  after an encounter with a group of protesters on the steps of the lincoln memorial last year
[2:00:45.800 --> 2:00:51.240]  before i begin i'd like to thank president trump for the opportunity to share some of my story
[2:00:51.240 --> 2:00:56.920]  and why it matters so much to this november's election in 2019 i attended the march for life
[2:00:56.920 --> 2:01:03.880]  in washington dc where i demonstrated in defense of the unborn later that day i bought a make
[2:01:03.880 --> 2:01:10.200]  america great again hat because our president donald trump has distinguished himself as one
[2:01:10.200 --> 2:01:16.040]  of the most pro-life presidents in the history of our country and i wanted to express my support
[2:01:16.040 --> 2:01:23.640]  for him too looking back now how could i possibly imagine that the simple act of putting on that
[2:01:23.640 --> 2:01:29.880]  red hat would unleash hate from the left and make myself the target of network and cable news
[2:01:29.880 --> 2:01:37.400]  networks nationwide being from kentucky the birthplace of abraham lincoln my classmates
[2:01:37.400 --> 2:01:43.160]  and i visited the lincoln memorial i found myself face to face with nathan phillips
[2:01:43.160 --> 2:01:48.840]  and other professional protesters looking to turn me into the latest poster child
[2:01:48.840 --> 2:01:55.000]  showing why trump is bad while the media portrayed me as an aggressor with a relentless
[2:01:55.000 --> 2:02:01.160]  smirk on my face in reality the video confirms i was standing with my hands behind my back
[2:02:01.160 --> 2:02:07.720]  and an awkward smile on my face that had two thoughts one don't do anything that might further
[2:02:07.720 --> 2:02:14.360]  agitate the man banging a drum in my face and two i was trying to follow a family friends advice
[2:02:15.240 --> 2:02:22.040]  never to do anything to embarrass your family your school or your community before i knew
[2:02:22.040 --> 2:02:28.360]  what was happening it was over one of mr phillips fellow agitators yet out we got him
[2:02:29.160 --> 2:02:36.280]  it's all right here on video and we won grandpa what i thought was a strange encounter quickly
[2:02:36.280 --> 2:02:42.680]  developed into a major news story complete with video footage my life changed forever in that one
[2:02:42.680 --> 2:02:49.160]  moment the full war machine of the mainstream media revved up into attack mode they did so
[2:02:49.160 --> 2:02:55.080]  without researching the full video of the incident without ever investigating mr phillips motives
[2:02:55.880 --> 2:03:03.160]  or without ever asking me for my side of the story and do you know why because the truth
[2:03:03.160 --> 2:03:10.600]  was not important advancing their anti christian anti conservative anti donald trump narrative was
[2:03:10.600 --> 2:03:16.280]  all that mattered and if advancing their narrative ruined the reputation and future of the teenager
[2:03:16.280 --> 2:03:23.000]  from covington kentucky will so be it that would teach him not to wear a mega hat i learned what
[2:03:23.000 --> 2:03:32.040]  was happening to me had a name it was called being cancelled as an annuled as in revoked as in made
[2:03:32.040 --> 2:03:37.960]  void cancelled is what's happening to people around this country who refuse to be silenced by the far
[2:03:37.960 --> 2:03:46.680]  left many are being fired humiliated or even threatened and often the media is a willing
[2:03:46.680 --> 2:03:53.320]  participant but i would not be cancelled i fought back hard to expose the media for what
[2:03:53.320 --> 2:04:00.200]  they did to me and i won a personal victory while much more must be done i look forward to the day
[2:04:00.200 --> 2:04:06.280]  that the media returns to providing balanced responsible and accountable news coverage i
[2:04:06.280 --> 2:04:11.880]  know president trump hopes for that too and i know you'll agree with me when we say that no one in
[2:04:11.880 --> 2:04:18.120]  this country has been a victim of unfair media coverage more than president donald trump in
[2:04:18.120 --> 2:04:25.400]  november i believe this country must unite around a president who calls the media out and refuses to
[2:04:25.400 --> 2:04:31.880]  allow them to create a narrative instead of reporting the facts i believe we must join a president
[2:04:31.880 --> 2:04:39.240]  who will challenge the media to return to objective journalism and together i believe we must all
[2:04:39.240 --> 2:04:45.320]  embrace our first amendment rights and not hide and fear the media or from the tech companies
[2:04:45.320 --> 2:04:52.600]  or from the outrage mob either this is worth fighting for this is worth voting for and this
[2:04:52.600 --> 2:04:59.240]  is what donald trump stands for thank you all for listening to me tonight and one more thing
[2:05:00.280 --> 2:05:01.960]  let's make america great again
[2:05:04.600 --> 2:05:10.840]  so the revolutionary act of wearing a red hat in dc at the liga memorial he had to be set up
[2:05:10.840 --> 2:05:16.760]  the very same group that works with facebook that uh those individuals were working with
[2:05:16.760 --> 2:05:23.000]  trying to set them up set me up they had these women come up and say f you uh you you're married
[2:05:23.000 --> 2:05:28.280]  to your mother you're an evil white person that's in brad you know you're i mean because we put the
[2:05:28.280 --> 2:05:34.600]  video out and i was saying i'm against your racism your brown cook looks clean they edited it to say
[2:05:34.600 --> 2:05:40.680]  jones attacks innocent native american women but they ignore him and walk away and so that was just
[2:05:40.680 --> 2:05:45.560]  a month or so before that happened they were waiting when i came out to do it with the very same
[2:05:45.560 --> 2:05:51.320]  group it's called now this or whatever something so they do this over and over and over and over again
[2:05:52.920 --> 2:05:56.920]  this is really blowing up in their face though it really is by the way ollie alexander is here
[2:05:56.920 --> 2:06:01.640]  with us again today uh we got cut short yesterday somewhere to get him back to handicap the election
[2:06:01.640 --> 2:06:05.400]  and give his views on trump's political animals good to have you're sorry go ahead hey no thanks
[2:06:05.400 --> 2:06:09.560]  alex uh yeah i think it's it's funny because you know that clip when it was going around the world
[2:06:09.560 --> 2:06:14.680]  people thought oh my gosh these guys are bad they're white they're catholic and we can see the agenda
[2:06:14.680 --> 2:06:21.720]  is anti white it's anti catholic it's anti republican anti southern uh and anti donald trump uh but
[2:06:21.720 --> 2:06:26.360]  you know i'm glad they got called out and we got to see hey this is a teenager and awkward smirk on
[2:06:26.360 --> 2:06:33.080]  his face and uh he's come out on top so i think it's a real win for everybody of course you've been
[2:06:33.080 --> 2:06:38.120]  involved heavily with the uh coventon catholic yeah 60 families so i did pro bono services for
[2:06:38.120 --> 2:06:43.720]  60 of the families it wasn't just nick saman who was being libeled and slandered in the news media
[2:06:43.720 --> 2:06:48.920]  it was everybody so uh it was it was you know they ended up offering me money for my services
[2:06:48.920 --> 2:06:52.040]  and i said i can't take it they said well only we're gonna make a lot of money i was like i just
[2:06:52.040 --> 2:06:56.520]  can't take it it felt good with my soul well expanding on that going back to that day you had
[2:06:56.520 --> 2:07:01.800]  the black israeli group it's just like a black nazi group and they're literally screaming we're
[2:07:01.800 --> 2:07:07.800]  gonna kill you kids we're gonna get you i mean and the media had all that raw footage and well
[2:07:07.800 --> 2:07:11.960]  what they and the kids all walked away they were trying to get away wait for their bus right and
[2:07:11.960 --> 2:07:16.520]  then so they're retreating right and finally they're retreated up against the wall right and
[2:07:16.520 --> 2:07:20.680]  they're bad for what not splitting their own throats i mean this is crazy absolutely crazy
[2:07:20.680 --> 2:07:24.760]  absolutely crazy and it was really you know the juxtaposition of the media was really interesting
[2:07:24.760 --> 2:07:30.120]  right because at first they left out the black israelites and it was a vietnam veteran native
[2:07:30.120 --> 2:07:36.120]  american was doing a ceremonial drum beat and this was his right his spiritual right in front of the
[2:07:36.120 --> 2:07:41.880]  lincoln memorial and it was like okay well that sounds weird you know i you don't see that too often um
[2:07:41.880 --> 2:07:48.760]  but here comes the kkk commandos the kkk kids from kentucky covington catholic you know they were
[2:07:48.760 --> 2:07:55.880]  just hijacking our brain with that cadence you know what's gonna happen is the mainstream media the
[2:07:55.880 --> 2:08:00.840]  corporate media has absolutely no credibility and no one buys into what they say i mean i mean they
[2:08:00.840 --> 2:08:05.000]  admit no one listens to us no one believes us because you're known liars yeah i think you got
[2:08:05.000 --> 2:08:09.880]  ahead of the curve um you know a lot of people haven't believed me but probably five or six years
[2:08:09.880 --> 2:08:15.080]  ago i said you know we're a decade away from there being no cnn we're a decade away from there being
[2:08:15.080 --> 2:08:21.000]  no cable news people don't realize that you know maybe one million or two million americans are
[2:08:21.000 --> 2:08:27.960]  watching cnn during prime time this is a country with 380 million residents this is a country with
[2:08:27.960 --> 2:08:35.880]  330 million citizens it is tyranny the idea that cnn can have a million viewers and dictate what
[2:08:35.880 --> 2:08:40.760]  legislation comes before the house of representatives or the senate and they decide who gets censored
[2:08:40.760 --> 2:08:45.720]  yeah and it's gonna click for the american people like uh this math sucks you know forget what you
[2:08:45.720 --> 2:08:51.400]  think about you know fox news info wars mike sirnevich periscope twitter blah blah whatever
[2:08:51.400 --> 2:08:56.200]  these independent creators it won't matter it's like the math sucks so i think that you and your
[2:08:56.200 --> 2:09:00.760]  network you guys have gotten ahead of it you've built a a loyal audience and that's what it's
[2:09:00.760 --> 2:09:06.600]  going to be the pewdie pies and the alex jones are going to be the curators of our future if you
[2:09:06.600 --> 2:09:11.640]  go back to the black lives matter that was almost all white people in dc coming in and and ordering
[2:09:11.640 --> 2:09:17.800]  the woman to bow and and to put her fist up that was nick sandman part two yeah because we'll show
[2:09:17.800 --> 2:09:23.320]  it when we come back tens of millions of views online and it's just the act of heroism not giving
[2:09:23.320 --> 2:09:30.280]  into the psychological demand to kneel yeah so the struggle session research mal china let's talk
[2:09:30.280 --> 2:09:33.960]  about struggle sessions and then let's look at the campaign and look at what trump needs to do to
[2:09:33.960 --> 2:09:37.640]  ensure the win but then what you think happens when the democrats contest the election which they
[2:09:37.640 --> 2:09:45.160]  say they'll do 67 days out ali xander and ali on twitter will be right back i'm gonna say something
[2:09:45.160 --> 2:09:49.800]  right now but it's one of the most important things i've ever said so please listen very very carefully
[2:09:49.800 --> 2:09:57.720]  donald trump is not the reason they released covet or had the lockdown they already had this plan the
[2:09:57.720 --> 2:10:04.600]  rockefeller foundation and billa melinda gates it is beyond critical it is life and death for you
[2:10:04.600 --> 2:10:09.160]  and your family to understand i'm not a real on the planet but this is a worldwide world government
[2:10:09.800 --> 2:10:17.000]  takeover on record that it's never going to end the united nations has admitted that first it's a
[2:10:17.000 --> 2:10:21.480]  month then it's six months then they say okay it's two years they're now saying two years
[2:10:22.440 --> 2:10:28.200]  they're now saying you'll never go back to normal no more gatherings no more anything constant force
[2:10:28.200 --> 2:10:33.880]  inoculations that they admit don't even work in the way they say they work they change your dna
[2:10:34.600 --> 2:10:40.120]  this is the culling of the planet this is the beginning of the straight jacket being put on
[2:10:40.120 --> 2:10:46.280]  you before you're slowly tortured to death and killed you understand the democrats are just going
[2:10:46.280 --> 2:10:52.120]  more and more left many positive about socialism liking it more than capitalism many of the ideas
[2:10:52.120 --> 2:10:59.160]  we fought for that were considered radical are now mainstream the radical left has taken over the
[2:10:59.160 --> 2:11:05.800]  democratic party and joe biden is marching in lockstep with them biden and the far left are
[2:11:05.800 --> 2:11:11.240]  promising to crush middle-class families with trillions in new taxes if you elect me your
[2:11:11.240 --> 2:11:16.760]  taxes are going to be raised not cut promising amnesty and health care for 11 million illegal
[2:11:16.760 --> 2:11:21.880]  immigrants should this shift for 11 million undocumented folks promising to shut down
[2:11:21.880 --> 2:11:28.520]  energy exploration killing jobs and hurting america's economy i guarantee we're gonna end
[2:11:28.520 --> 2:11:35.960]  fossil fuel in joe biden's america the radical left get whatever they want and you get to pay for it
[2:11:35.960 --> 2:11:42.280]  they've already taken over joe biden and the democratic party don't let them take over america
[2:11:42.280 --> 2:12:01.800]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:12:01.800 --> 2:12:07.800]  you
[2:12:07.800 --> 2:12:15.320]  spend my days with a woman and kind smoke my stove and drink all my life
[2:12:20.200 --> 2:12:27.320]  made of my mind making you start going california with an aching in my heart
[2:12:27.320 --> 2:12:34.280]  oh ali alexander no it's ali alexander he says mike sternum he says it too i'm great
[2:12:34.280 --> 2:12:40.920]  dead oh i know it's ali like mohammed ali floats like a butterfly stings like a b it's ali alexander
[2:12:40.920 --> 2:12:50.200]  yeah you know but i i answer by it's ali it's ali it's ali it's that son of a you know and uh
[2:12:50.200 --> 2:12:54.920]  just depends and then they say you're in islamist extremist but i love your response the name
[2:12:54.920 --> 2:12:59.800]  ali's a lot older than islam explains people right exactly you know i mean jesus was born a
[2:12:59.800 --> 2:13:05.080]  jew he came from the line of david and jacob uh you know they're in the middle east you had romans
[2:13:05.080 --> 2:13:11.880]  you had jews you had north africans and arabes you know before there were ever you know european
[2:13:11.880 --> 2:13:16.600]  continent christians white european continent christians you know there were some romans
[2:13:16.600 --> 2:13:22.520]  uh there were arab christians so you know ali predates islam uh islam's 1400 years old
[2:13:22.520 --> 2:13:27.480]  but then it says oh we invented the mathematics and the alphabet no that was the Arabs did all
[2:13:27.480 --> 2:13:31.240]  that that wasn't the muslims right exactly and it's it's funny how people you know mess this
[2:13:31.240 --> 2:13:36.600]  history up but yeah you know the Arabs you know they're the same line from abraham you know abraham
[2:13:36.600 --> 2:13:43.480]  became abraham and he was an adult when he became an israelite and sol became paul and that's when
[2:13:43.480 --> 2:13:48.520]  he became a christian exactly you know and mohammed and ali which is like kind of the second
[2:13:48.520 --> 2:13:52.840]  like kind of the second prophet of islam they were already adults before they had their you know
[2:13:52.840 --> 2:14:00.040]  whatever grand revelation so yeah Arabs predate muslims everybody ali and christianity they mix
[2:14:00.040 --> 2:14:05.240]  well well egypt used to be almost 100 christian yeah they had some zohar askers and a few others
[2:14:05.240 --> 2:14:11.080]  some jews but it's like 95 i was reading not now because the muslims they don't let you know that's
[2:14:11.080 --> 2:14:15.560]  my problem with islam is they you look at muslim countries they're like 90 muslims they don't let
[2:14:15.560 --> 2:14:19.000]  you have your religion yeah they've wiped people out and you know but that's also the fault of the
[2:14:19.000 --> 2:14:23.960]  west we've let a lot of these coptic christians die over the past uh 20 or 30 years well when i went
[2:14:23.960 --> 2:14:28.200]  to college they talked that we launched a crusades you'd say fact the crusades were the response to
[2:14:28.200 --> 2:14:34.040]  500 years up to a thousand years of islamic invasions bingo going all the way into western europe right i
[2:14:34.040 --> 2:14:40.600]  mean the muslims owned spain all of spain you know had to push them out they're a lot reconquisto
[2:14:40.600 --> 2:14:46.760]  that's real we're gonna get in trouble for this you know these extremist new crusaders
[2:14:46.760 --> 2:14:53.480]  ali alexander and alex jones i said it we need a reformation in islam and we do need we do need
[2:14:53.480 --> 2:14:58.520]  to take back the holy land yeah yeah i don't i don't want to have some game and i'll say it i
[2:14:59.800 --> 2:15:04.920]  look at how look at how the leftist allied with islam yeah they're trying to conquer us yeah
[2:15:06.600 --> 2:15:10.200]  well i've talked about it before because they don't believe anything right how can you
[2:15:10.200 --> 2:15:17.080]  believe in the extreme tenets of the quran and then tell boys to dress in dresses and then tell fat
[2:15:17.080 --> 2:15:23.080]  girls to say fat and don't wear makeup they just believe in confusion and inversion wherever they
[2:15:23.080 --> 2:15:27.160]  are nothing needs to make sense it's not progressive it's not liberal it's not yeah the muslims are
[2:15:27.160 --> 2:15:32.920]  executing homosexuals everywhere but muslims are good but the open free west is bad yeah yeah it's
[2:15:32.920 --> 2:15:38.120]  it's insane but they again they mean to subvert what we believe they don't mean to put any why
[2:15:38.120 --> 2:15:43.080]  do the globalists hate christianity so much because we reformed the world i mean the bloodline of
[2:15:43.080 --> 2:15:50.040]  jesus the the the temporal bloodline of jesus that continued after his his death is absolutely
[2:15:50.040 --> 2:15:55.080]  amazing you know the catholics used to have a doctrine called the social kingship of christ
[2:15:55.080 --> 2:16:00.360]  and so you have to imagine you know rome was in this period called pax romana it was a period
[2:16:00.360 --> 2:16:05.640]  a very limited period when the roman empire was was at peace it was the only time in which
[2:16:05.640 --> 2:16:12.440]  jesus's bloodline could fulfill his prophecy by birth they could take over an empire and then
[2:16:12.440 --> 2:16:18.120]  what happened with rome rome inverted until it became the holy roman empire it ceded britain
[2:16:18.120 --> 2:16:25.800]  britain ceded america and those words we the people liberated people and gave them christian liberty
[2:16:25.800 --> 2:16:30.680]  over monarchs all across the world this would not have happened without a jesus christ and the
[2:16:30.680 --> 2:16:36.120]  globalists realized this is 2000 years ago this guy said that women and men can worship together
[2:16:36.120 --> 2:16:40.760]  that there's christian liberty that there's a proper order but you have more freedom under the law
[2:16:40.760 --> 2:16:45.080]  and he's still the most dangerous guy to the globalist today and while you said it's true and
[2:16:45.080 --> 2:16:49.640]  it's not that the institutions in england or the vatican aren't corrupt in that problem right it's
[2:16:49.640 --> 2:16:54.600]  that it's god works through mysterious ways you can literally what you just said see that whole
[2:16:54.600 --> 2:17:00.200]  thing happening in western europe and everything right and think about this we're also competing
[2:17:00.200 --> 2:17:06.280]  with the bloodline of the antichrist you know you had germany you had france you had britain
[2:17:06.280 --> 2:17:12.600]  and you had russia and all of those royal families are former senatorial families from rome so you
[2:17:12.600 --> 2:17:17.320]  know while jesus was taking over and his church was taking over the west which ultimately came to
[2:17:17.320 --> 2:17:22.360]  this beautiful thing we have this republic and christian liberty you know um you know your history
[2:17:22.360 --> 2:17:27.400]  so the patricians the black nobility explain that to people yeah because they went off to romania
[2:17:27.400 --> 2:17:33.000]  hungary eastern europe to control the trades coming in once the empire fell and then vladian paler the
[2:17:33.000 --> 2:17:38.280]  dragon all that they've got their whole thing going yeah i mean it's it's it should be no secret the
[2:17:38.280 --> 2:17:44.360]  globalists are as old as the church and there has been a war between globalism and christian liberty
[2:17:44.360 --> 2:17:49.480]  but to be clear the current pope is a globalist they've basically taken over yes they've got a
[2:17:49.480 --> 2:17:52.760]  president then that's against the globalists in the middle of their takeover but in the middle of
[2:17:52.760 --> 2:17:58.280]  that they've got this this this this this devil antipope in in in the church yeah and we'll find
[2:17:58.280 --> 2:18:02.360]  out you know the antipope is a particular term you know and they'll determine that maybe in the
[2:18:02.360 --> 2:18:06.600]  future and and it basically but almost all the catholics i know just say this guy's absolutely
[2:18:06.600 --> 2:18:12.440]  a devil catholics hate this pope more than christian evangelicals this guy is not with them
[2:18:12.440 --> 2:18:18.440]  he's a guy who's who's who's not flirted with communism has been a communist he is a jesuit
[2:18:18.440 --> 2:18:23.960]  he has uh brought back this bad guy we ought to put him on the screen uh cardinal cardinal
[2:18:23.960 --> 2:18:30.040]  or bishop mecheric very very bad news uh and then his like right hand man in australia got caught
[2:18:30.040 --> 2:18:33.800]  running pedophile ranks yeah convicted there's there's a bunch of them i mean these were the
[2:18:33.800 --> 2:18:38.280]  guys who whipped the votes so that he would win inside of the curia and so you know there's a
[2:18:38.280 --> 2:18:42.600]  rumor so they used the pedophilia blackmail to get him in sorry go ahead right yeah so you know
[2:18:42.600 --> 2:18:49.560]  there's a rumor so this guy prayed with obama in 2008 he was the guy who was in charge with
[2:18:49.560 --> 2:18:54.520]  hunting down the pedophiles in america and it turns out in new jersey he was running his own
[2:18:54.520 --> 2:18:59.560]  and there's gonna there's news that's gonna break soon i think here uh in the next week or two
[2:18:59.560 --> 2:19:03.800]  but some of his victims are actually gonna come forward in new jersey and they're gonna out him
[2:19:03.800 --> 2:19:08.520]  but this is the guy that pope frances then sent to china if you'll remember the news out of china
[2:19:08.520 --> 2:19:13.000]  where the catholic church brokered a deal with china to keep the catholic church open that's
[2:19:13.000 --> 2:19:18.280]  McCarrick this guy is real real real bad and now they're killing the underground church the
[2:19:18.280 --> 2:19:22.200]  underground christian church the underground catholic church and they're propping up a fake
[2:19:22.200 --> 2:19:28.680]  catholic church inside of china and they're putting uh uh president g's picture now in the
[2:19:28.680 --> 2:19:34.920]  church and that's the guy who brokered it that pedophile absolutely and the current pope says
[2:19:34.920 --> 2:19:39.560]  that the the church can merge with the chinese government be run by communists yeah in fact
[2:19:39.560 --> 2:19:45.000]  you're right you're right the ccp gets to determine who's a bishop and who's a cardinal outside of
[2:19:45.000 --> 2:19:51.640]  china so there's this merging of this so this is 180 degrees from pope john polis second uh uh yeah
[2:19:51.640 --> 2:19:55.640]  close to 100 and you may some people have some criticisms that sure i'm i'm just saying he was
[2:19:55.640 --> 2:20:01.240]  the anti-communist yeah oh yeah i mean we're talking like this is crazy right yeah so it's i mean
[2:20:01.240 --> 2:20:06.280]  there's a pope john polis second fought the soviet union this pope merges with china right and and
[2:20:06.280 --> 2:20:12.200]  see the catholics have understood it you know in a way that only america has whereas europe was kind
[2:20:12.200 --> 2:20:17.000]  of weak need you know with the nazis and weak need with the communists catholics have understood
[2:20:17.000 --> 2:20:22.760]  that communism is a spiritual threat to us not just a political threat oh it's a hundred percent
[2:20:22.760 --> 2:20:28.760]  lucifer yeah well they say you must deny god in order to be a communist and then they go further
[2:20:28.760 --> 2:20:33.640]  and say you must hate christianity in particular and then suddenly anti from the communist all
[2:20:33.640 --> 2:20:39.000]  start wearing pentagrams well not a coincidence it's it's real folks we'll be right back stay with us

[2:22:50.840 --> 2:22:55.560]  i've pointed out statements out of the council on farm relations and other globalist organs
[2:22:55.560 --> 2:23:02.040]  that they know trump is going to win in a landslide so their strategy will be to contest the election
[2:23:02.040 --> 2:23:07.320]  if they fail to successfully steal it then they are openly now wargaming this is in the new york
[2:23:07.320 --> 2:23:13.240]  times having democrat states and cities secede from the union just like they've ignored trump's
[2:23:13.240 --> 2:23:19.000]  policies on coronavirus and kept their areas locked down that is nothing but a dress rehearsal
[2:23:19.000 --> 2:23:23.560]  they are saying they're going to have their own separate inauguration not in dc they said in a
[2:23:23.560 --> 2:23:30.600]  another city colosia said this when they crown biden and kamala harris ladies and gentlemen
[2:23:30.600 --> 2:23:36.680]  this is the organized civil war this is their public criminal plan we should be praying we
[2:23:36.680 --> 2:23:40.840]  should be spreading the word we should be demanding trouble in the office to expose this criminal
[2:23:40.840 --> 2:23:56.760]  activity you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:24:11.160 --> 2:24:17.480]  in our lives tonight out on the streets again ollie alexander ollie alexander like mohammed
[2:24:17.480 --> 2:24:26.920]  ollie is here right the part of the song right here gonna turn you loose gonna set me free
[2:24:30.040 --> 2:24:35.800]  a little bit better than i used to be because i'm alive ollie alexander's here no you were you've
[2:24:35.800 --> 2:24:40.040]  been on a lot four years ago three years ago two years ago and then for some reason you weren't on
[2:24:40.040 --> 2:24:43.800]  for a while but you've come back even stronger gotten back in your christian faiths have done
[2:24:43.800 --> 2:24:50.120]  a deep dive on it and you're just dead on you're really informative and now we're here yesterday
[2:24:50.120 --> 2:24:53.320]  we went off to the esoteric we just did it again because that's just behind all this i want to
[2:24:53.320 --> 2:24:57.560]  crazy i want to talk about some of the election first but yeah we should good versus evil is
[2:24:57.560 --> 2:25:01.640]  the root of it so if you start from there you get everything if you don't then nothing makes sense but
[2:25:03.240 --> 2:25:07.320]  everything's coming to a head mental illnesses exploding suicides exploding
[2:25:07.320 --> 2:25:11.960]  breakups of families are exploding but statistically great awakenings are happening amazing arts
[2:25:11.960 --> 2:25:15.560]  being made people are coming together that weren't we're finding out who's good we're finding out who's
[2:25:15.560 --> 2:25:20.840]  bad there's a quickening a separation of the wheat from the chaff or the garbage from the gold
[2:25:20.840 --> 2:25:24.760]  yeah and i think you're seeing a polarity and i think that that's why a lot of christians are
[2:25:24.760 --> 2:25:32.280]  like okay are we almost there we have to imagine alex when when christ prophesies that there is
[2:25:32.280 --> 2:25:37.800]  going to be an underground christian church through john and revelation is well how do we get there
[2:25:37.800 --> 2:25:41.640]  from point a to point b because not like we wake up one day and oh there's the mark of the beast and
[2:25:41.640 --> 2:25:45.960]  oh there's you know war and famine and a third of the world dies and boom underground church
[2:25:45.960 --> 2:25:51.640]  there has to be some gradual you know and the left says all of the world churches are not essential
[2:25:51.640 --> 2:25:55.800]  but the topless bars and liquor stores are yeah and so what a church is doing they're having to
[2:25:55.800 --> 2:26:00.040]  meet underground they're having to go to bars they're meeting in in walmart and you know singing
[2:26:00.040 --> 2:26:05.800]  praise to jesus christ so you know i you're not crazy if you think like hey this is a little
[2:26:05.800 --> 2:26:10.280]  weird so that we are either this is my this is just like are there announcing world government mark
[2:26:10.280 --> 2:26:14.920]  to buy and sell yeah and pope francis is participating in this they're supposed to have you know this
[2:26:14.920 --> 2:26:19.560]  this little conference in dubai over education where they don't talk about jesus christ or god
[2:26:19.560 --> 2:26:23.400]  and it's going to be not just the abrahamic religions but all religions it's really really
[2:26:23.400 --> 2:26:28.920]  super creepy but you know people just they gotta keep to the faith and if you've if you've been away
[2:26:28.920 --> 2:26:34.680]  if you've been away my strongest message to you right now is to come back come back to the family
[2:26:34.680 --> 2:26:39.640]  a lot of people are doing it we're not all good you know i i cussed yesterday on air you know i
[2:26:39.640 --> 2:26:44.280]  drink occasionally i do i do wild stuff but you got to come back to the faith because you have to
[2:26:44.280 --> 2:26:49.640]  be educated about what's going on right now if we're going to get shoved underground well there's
[2:26:49.640 --> 2:26:55.880]  no doubt it's been prophecies manifest yeah and we're either this is thing alex this isn't
[2:26:55.880 --> 2:27:00.280]  theologically sound but this is how my brain understand it we must imagine that jesus was
[2:27:00.280 --> 2:27:05.400]  prophesized then he was preconfigured and then he had a transfiguration during his ministry we appeared
[2:27:05.400 --> 2:27:10.280]  with alijah and moses and that's how i think about this is we are either here at the end times
[2:27:10.280 --> 2:27:14.520]  right now the final days of the end times because the end times have actually been going on since
[2:27:14.520 --> 2:27:19.160]  the cross but we were either in the final days of the end times or this is a prefiguration where
[2:27:19.160 --> 2:27:24.200]  people like us are called to get prepared people like a dress rehearsal right i feel that's what i
[2:27:24.200 --> 2:27:28.040]  think that's what i think it is my spirit tells me but then it'll come very quick we're not waiting
[2:27:28.040 --> 2:27:32.680]  a thousand years a hundred this is like hey get lined up get ready because you know god's gonna
[2:27:32.680 --> 2:27:36.920]  give us a chance for you puts us on the field that's what i think god gives us free will but
[2:27:36.920 --> 2:27:41.320]  he sends christ he sends the province he gives us a cheat sheet he's like i'm gonna give you
[2:27:41.320 --> 2:27:44.920]  free will make resolution but here's a cheat sheet please we'll make a promise yeah yeah and this is
[2:27:44.920 --> 2:27:48.680]  where this is where we do the writing this is where we do the videos this is where we clear our
[2:27:48.680 --> 2:27:52.920]  debts this is where we you know i've got food in my house i actually bought it from your website
[2:27:52.920 --> 2:27:57.160]  which he didn't give me a discount by the way but i you know i got three months of food in my garage
[2:27:57.160 --> 2:28:01.560]  because i'm like okay if anything goes crazy you know i want to be able to take care of others
[2:28:01.560 --> 2:28:07.320]  and take care of myself let's talk about some good news it's coming out now that they've ordered
[2:28:07.320 --> 2:28:13.080]  them to remove the algorithm where they said one cover case is 15 that then expanded out
[2:28:13.080 --> 2:28:21.160]  logarithmically so texas counties drop 4600 cover cases in one county to under 100 after audit
[2:28:21.160 --> 2:28:26.440]  that's a huge story needs to go viral info wars dot com kit daniels but then now this beauty
[2:28:26.440 --> 2:28:34.440]  i mean they knew 101 the doctors in new york state in uh pennsylvania the nursing homes absolutely
[2:28:34.440 --> 2:28:40.600]  they all told them do not send people that have pneumonia covid to a nursing home that's the one
[2:28:40.600 --> 2:28:44.520]  group you can kill so families can't go to see what's happening but we're going to send infected
[2:28:44.520 --> 2:28:51.240]  people there causing 40 plus percent of the death so doj cracks down on dem governor covet orders
[2:28:51.240 --> 2:28:55.480]  may have resulted in deaths of elderly nursing home residents i told folks a month ago i was told
[2:28:55.480 --> 2:28:58.920]  the justice department don't worry there is a criminal investigation ongoing it's now confirmed
[2:28:59.960 --> 2:29:04.280]  letters to them all saying stop hiding evidence because they're not reporting even at state level
[2:29:04.280 --> 2:29:09.160]  get it ready we're coming to get it so this is this is a big big big deal this is designed so
[2:29:09.160 --> 2:29:13.560]  that they'll officially hide it now they've got more criminal charges and and so this is a big big
[2:29:13.560 --> 2:29:18.520]  move this is the right thing for trump to do for those that were killed but also to call out the
[2:29:18.520 --> 2:29:23.080]  deep state that wanted these death numbers and wanted the money the way they set it up 50 something
[2:29:23.080 --> 2:29:26.680]  thousand for everybody they killed that's a bounty they're now getting caught right handed this is
[2:29:26.680 --> 2:29:31.160]  what we need to see more of this is absolutely what we need to see more of and it was people on
[2:29:31.160 --> 2:29:36.440]  twitter you know in particular one of our mutual friends jack mesopic was like focus on the nursing
[2:29:36.440 --> 2:29:40.600]  homes focus on the nursing homes yeah trumpet administration's like the the the the the the
[2:29:40.600 --> 2:29:48.200]  the the and it's like walk your i'm gonna cuss walk your ass over to hhs and order some people
[2:29:48.200 --> 2:29:52.840]  to do some stuff and so finally that got done but i'm gonna tell you think about this environment
[2:29:52.840 --> 2:29:57.640]  alex you have an environment where nurses are used to people dying they're not gonna freak out
[2:29:57.640 --> 2:30:02.440]  they're all sharing the same air filtration system and it's probably in the ac that's what a lot of
[2:30:02.440 --> 2:30:07.000]  people are thinking right now is that covet is in the ac unit and it's getting spread exactly
[2:30:07.000 --> 2:30:13.160]  into this thing and then we saw you know that that that black kid beat up that that white elderly guy
[2:30:13.160 --> 2:30:17.480]  because well the kid had coveted or that maybe he was a young adult the black guy that was in
[2:30:17.480 --> 2:30:21.880]  michigan he was like an 18 year old black guy why would you do that why would he has coveted so
[2:30:21.880 --> 2:30:25.160]  they put him in a nursing home that makes no sense i've never heard of anything like them well the
[2:30:25.160 --> 2:30:31.320]  doctors that because understate laws around the country doctors have to own uh the nursing homes
[2:30:31.320 --> 2:30:36.040]  but they're using just a manager right they tried to tell quomo yep and others don't do this and
[2:30:36.040 --> 2:30:41.160]  they had leticia james threatened to arrest a member in like in like march if you don't take
[2:30:41.160 --> 2:30:46.120]  these patients will take your license so they ordered this when the default is don't pork
[2:30:46.120 --> 2:30:52.280]  astley on yourself and lie to yeah i mean they knew from idly most of the tests for 85 or higher
[2:30:52.280 --> 2:30:56.760]  they knew it was all in the nursing homes so why did they duplicate it yeah right that's cold and
[2:30:56.760 --> 2:31:01.320]  they didn't use the ships and that was the greatest most charitable act that trump gave right we gave
[2:31:01.320 --> 2:31:06.600]  one to los angeles and one to new york the comfort and the mercy or whatever and they went unused
[2:31:06.600 --> 2:31:10.440]  why did they go and those old ships by layer design not to have circulation exactly they're
[2:31:10.440 --> 2:31:14.600]  separate the windows are open they learn that yeah yeah it's it's crazy i mean i think that we
[2:31:14.600 --> 2:31:19.720]  looked at a genocide here they did it on purpose yeah which shows the cold bloodedness of them
[2:31:19.720 --> 2:31:25.240]  yeah and it was new jersey new york and pennsylvania as you said it's it's 40 of higher of our nursing
[2:31:25.240 --> 2:31:30.760]  home deaths you're not just talking elderly elderly nursing home people in these three states
[2:31:30.760 --> 2:31:36.040]  there would never be a ramp up or lockdown without that because it turns out this pneumonia only kills
[2:31:36.040 --> 2:31:43.560]  people that are totally deficient in zinc d3 and vitamin c and because of the gut not absorbing
[2:31:43.560 --> 2:31:47.880]  when you get older these people are all deficient they're sitting ducks right and this is why i said
[2:31:47.880 --> 2:31:56.280]  look if anthony fouchy you know this really hits home for me if anthony fouchy gave two shits about
[2:31:56.280 --> 2:32:03.080]  this pandemic or two shits about black people then the government would have subsidized vitamin d
[2:32:03.080 --> 2:32:07.960]  it cost 25 dollars total a year and we would have given that to black people but what happened
[2:32:07.960 --> 2:32:11.480]  okay well after the nursing homes we found out oh well black people are disproportionately
[2:32:11.480 --> 2:32:17.480]  affected by this yeah because you if you go out in the sun you can absorb your d3 within 30 minutes
[2:32:17.480 --> 2:32:21.800]  it takes me three hours because my skin color so black people need to be on a summit i don't tell
[2:32:21.800 --> 2:32:25.480]  black folks why their skin cancer right another cancer right so high because black people need
[2:32:25.480 --> 2:32:29.800]  more sun than anybody right and it's ironic it's ironic you know we're built for it we need it well
[2:32:29.800 --> 2:32:34.120]  why it's from the ice age types or whatever i need are designed to get more of it because we get less
[2:32:34.120 --> 2:32:38.360]  of it right and it's and i forgot what country is it if it's if finland or one of these other
[2:32:38.360 --> 2:32:43.480]  countries they also don't get sun because of cloud cover so the government subsidizes vitamin d and
[2:32:43.480 --> 2:32:47.480]  they all take it during winter and they weren't affected by it so i mean you're absolutely right
[2:32:47.480 --> 2:32:51.880]  is like it's our immune system that wants to fight back but there are vulnerable populations
[2:32:51.880 --> 2:32:55.720]  and our government's not using doing anything and it's on the united's website yeah you don't have
[2:32:55.720 --> 2:33:00.600]  a sink you don't have d3 you die yep they're essential yep and they've literally got a fbi
[2:33:00.600 --> 2:33:06.600]  investigate vitamin companies that said like like even vitamin water they went after them for saying
[2:33:06.600 --> 2:33:11.880]  this is essential it boosts your immune system vitamin d does yeah yeah it's like saying oxygen
[2:33:11.880 --> 2:33:16.920]  doesn't keep you alive you die with no oxygen in five minutes you die without water in about four
[2:33:16.920 --> 2:33:23.000]  five days without food in about a month okay because food's nutrients it's crazy it's absolutely crazy
[2:33:23.000 --> 2:33:27.960]  remember who came out and said you can't boost your immune system dr berks said that you can't
[2:33:27.960 --> 2:33:34.200]  use the word boost and they quietly let that fade away these people are sick sick sick freaks
[2:33:34.200 --> 2:33:37.800]  ladies and gentlemen we'll be back we've got a bunch of clips we're gonna play on the other side

[2:34:50.840 --> 2:34:57.400]  you will learn incrementally to submit so think about and remember the phases of the Fauci fraud

[2:35:02.520 --> 2:35:07.320]  from they lied about person to person the un covered it all up then exaggerated the death
[2:35:07.320 --> 2:35:15.560]  rate at 4% but it's actually 0.032 now and dropping then they set the test up to count
[2:35:15.560 --> 2:35:19.960]  almost all false positives they put the names of people that died of other diseases in the
[2:35:19.960 --> 2:35:25.080]  covid column they only said there'd be a 15 day lockdown now we're six months later now they say
[2:35:25.080 --> 2:35:29.240]  it's permanent you got to wear masks forever and forced inoculations are coming and they're

[2:40:14.520 --> 2:40:25.240]  my name is chen guang chung standing up to tyranny is not easy i know when i spoke out against
[2:40:25.240 --> 2:40:38.120]  china's one chart policy and other injustices i was prosecuted beaten sent to prison and put
[2:40:38.120 --> 2:40:50.040]  under house arrest by the chinese communist party the ccp in april 2005 2012 i escaped
[2:40:50.040 --> 2:41:02.920]  and was given shelter in the american embassy in beijing i'm forever grateful to the american
[2:41:02.920 --> 2:41:16.440]  people for welcoming and my family to the united states where we are now free the ccp is an enemy
[2:41:16.440 --> 2:41:28.920]  of humanity it is terrorizing its own people and it is threatening the well-being of the world
[2:41:30.280 --> 2:41:44.280]  in china expressing beliefs or ideas not approved by the ccp religion democracy human rights can
[2:41:44.280 --> 2:41:55.640]  led to prison the nation lives under math surveillance and censorship the us must use
[2:41:55.640 --> 2:42:09.960]  its values of freedom democracy and the rule of law to gather a coalition of other democracies
[2:42:09.960 --> 2:42:21.720]  to stop ccp's aggression president trump had led on this and we need the other countries
[2:42:21.720 --> 2:42:35.080]  to join him in this fight a fight for our future standing up to fight unfairness isn't easy i know
[2:42:35.080 --> 2:42:47.640]  so does president trump but he has showing the courage to reach that fight we need to support
[2:42:48.440 --> 2:42:56.280]  vote and fight for president trump for the sake of the world thank you
[2:42:57.000 --> 2:43:00.840]  chin wang shing about pronounce that right what a great patriot i'm gonna read about him years ago
[2:43:00.840 --> 2:43:07.240]  in in in prisons for over a decade tortured now blind up there not his own language in front
[2:43:07.240 --> 2:43:12.280]  of all that giving great speech yeah and he represents the millions of christians buddhist
[2:43:12.280 --> 2:43:17.640]  and muslims who are in literal death camps and the left doesn't even want to hear about that
[2:43:17.640 --> 2:43:22.280]  and that shows us i'm worried about their fate i have empathy but that shows us who these big tech
[2:43:22.280 --> 2:43:27.400]  companies are who these corporations are and that trump is actually not just groveling in the face
[2:43:27.400 --> 2:43:32.120]  that's saying it's wrong that is an incredible moral high ground trump is the only president
[2:43:32.120 --> 2:43:37.160]  in 50 years to pull us out of wars i mean my god trumps good trumps good folks let's just say it
[2:43:37.160 --> 2:43:42.840]  trumps amazing thank you god for trump damn right i'm not ashamed of trump i am people wish he'd
[2:43:42.840 --> 2:43:47.000]  do more hell i wish i could do more no he's done an amazing job yeah he has and and what happened
[2:43:47.000 --> 2:43:51.720]  to media media was supposed to speak truth to power and they're not speaking truth to power when
[2:43:51.720 --> 2:43:56.760]  it comes to china you've got microsoft you've got twitter you've got the mba you've got all of these
[2:43:56.760 --> 2:44:01.800]  companies cooperating with the persecution of people you know we just had you know dragonfly with
[2:44:01.800 --> 2:44:06.360]  google what was that that was just last year now everyone's forgotten about that google was building
[2:44:06.360 --> 2:44:13.320]  the ccp a tool to censor search censor search discovery and to track down dissidents think about
[2:44:13.320 --> 2:44:18.680]  this alex what about the i don't know what it is it's probably tens of millions or hundreds of
[2:44:18.680 --> 2:44:24.280]  millions of women who had abortions under the one child forced abortions forced abortions
[2:44:24.280 --> 2:44:28.840]  and what that psychologically is still doing with them because they're not getting any mental
[2:44:28.840 --> 2:44:32.760]  health care they're not getting any spiritual care and those women are just you know they're
[2:44:32.760 --> 2:44:39.160]  suffering still and also the doubling of cancer for some different parts of the reproductive
[2:44:39.160 --> 2:44:42.680]  track when you have when you have an abortion yeah when you're met you know when you're messing
[2:44:42.680 --> 2:44:48.040]  with the normal bodily functions it creates stress and it builds inflammation and that's
[2:44:48.040 --> 2:44:51.800]  you know that's one day where we're going to talk about cancer is we're going to talk about cancer
[2:44:51.800 --> 2:44:59.160]  in an educated way you know that acknowledges stress and inflammation causes a environment
[2:44:59.160 --> 2:45:05.880]  which allows these cancer cells to replicate that's right speaking of people taking action here's a
[2:45:05.880 --> 2:45:12.520]  article it's up on info wars.com a c-span caller says she's a democrat from minneapolis upset the
[2:45:12.520 --> 2:45:18.120]  dnc did not mention the rioting and looting this convention just the last two nights has awakened
[2:45:18.120 --> 2:45:22.440]  me that there is hope that there are people that are willing to fight for us in our communities
[2:45:22.440 --> 2:45:27.960]  what was the left thinking triggering all this evil well they they need to cover when they
[2:45:27.960 --> 2:45:31.320]  contest the election they already know they're going to lose folks yep they want this as a cover
[2:45:31.320 --> 2:45:36.520]  to overthrow trump and america so so you're thinking oh they're losing by this they were already
[2:45:36.520 --> 2:45:40.440]  losing it's part of a larger plan here's the call to c-span.
[2:45:40.440 --> 2:45:50.440]  hoda democrats line hi barb hi uh yes um i'm a democrat and our convention last week
[2:45:51.960 --> 2:45:57.960]  is no comparison to what i've seen in just the last two nights what do you mean i'm from minnesota
[2:45:57.960 --> 2:46:06.440]  where all these riots and looting and the burning started and i mean not a mention about us last week
[2:46:06.440 --> 2:46:14.920]  about saving our communities helping our homeless rebuilding our businesses and this convention
[2:46:14.920 --> 2:46:22.520]  just in the last two nights has has awakened me that there is hope that there are people
[2:46:23.080 --> 2:46:28.760]  that are willing to fight for us people in our communities barb are you in the are you in the
[2:46:28.760 --> 2:46:36.760]  twin cities area or outside in the in the twin cities and right outside the twin cities has some
[2:46:36.760 --> 2:46:43.880]  of the protests have they frightened you yeah absolutely they've been you know seven miles away
[2:46:43.880 --> 2:46:53.320]  with a a new um john johnson of our party going into a neighborhood with 200 of black
[2:46:53.320 --> 2:47:02.040]  life matter supporters and terrorizing innocent neighbors in a community it is scary all right
[2:47:02.840 --> 2:47:07.160]  and barb we're going to have to leave it there thank you for calling the alley the left's doing this
[2:47:08.120 --> 2:47:14.600]  you know they want to win under the guise of civil rights but they tipped it over and they
[2:47:14.600 --> 2:47:21.800]  turned into a crime wave an absolute crime wave and then the soros funded and tifa arms you know
[2:47:21.800 --> 2:47:27.080]  they've actually gaslighted the entire situation and you know honestly i don't think the democrats
[2:47:27.080 --> 2:47:32.360]  know that they're getting the wrong end of the deal i think that the marxists actually don't
[2:47:32.360 --> 2:47:36.760]  want to fight the reelection of a president you know we've had two terms with clinton two
[2:47:36.760 --> 2:47:41.560]  terms with obama two terms with bush they figure okay give trump his two terms and then we'll put
[2:47:41.560 --> 2:47:46.760]  forth a real socialist in 2024 and that i agree this is a beta test yeah and that's what we're
[2:47:46.760 --> 2:47:51.320]  going to see so kamala harris is going to come up in 2024 say well i was the vp nominee now make
[2:47:51.320 --> 2:47:57.960]  me the real nominee and aoc is going to be like no no no no no no no no dsa is here democrat socialist
[2:47:57.960 --> 2:48:03.880]  of america it's unbelievable and and again these elites just want to wreck stuff because like soros
[2:48:03.880 --> 2:48:08.520]  said the happiest time of his life was rounding up jews yeah and then he says that yeah they love
[2:48:08.520 --> 2:48:13.320]  the chaos and then they can refashion it back together this transformers little thing but it's
[2:48:13.320 --> 2:48:17.800]  going to look like frankincine well that's it they love the incredible power of destroying a stable
[2:48:17.800 --> 2:48:23.080]  system alchemy exactly because then they can play god yep yep they want the philosopher stone

[2:51:19.400 --> 2:51:24.440]  what else do you want to add in the few minutes we have left about the election what trump should
[2:51:24.440 --> 2:51:27.720]  do you were here a month ago saying trump better get aggressive yeah better go after and we're
[2:51:27.720 --> 2:51:31.560]  starting to see that and we're seeing his numbers go straight up if it wasn't for you if it wasn't
[2:51:31.560 --> 2:51:35.880]  for me if it wasn't for mike sernovich and it wasn't for scott adams if it wasn't for voices in the
[2:51:35.880 --> 2:51:41.480]  wilderness that launched a constructive war against the campaign which a lot of people gotta
[2:51:41.480 --> 2:51:45.480]  remember they were all of you they were mad at us a few months ago we were like gosh they were bad
[2:51:45.480 --> 2:51:50.600]  and and all these maga people on twitter like no no tulsa tulsa was this and tulsa was that
[2:51:50.600 --> 2:51:55.720]  was like a million people were never gonna show up brad sucks at his job let's do some market
[2:51:55.720 --> 2:52:00.040]  targeting and let's be the party of law in order let's not tweet law in order and we've retooled
[2:52:00.040 --> 2:52:05.560]  this campaign out so you know donald trump was set for kind of a loss we've put him back on track
[2:52:05.560 --> 2:52:09.800]  he's back to the february you know donald trump who was gonna win in a landslide he's back to be
[2:52:09.800 --> 2:52:14.600]  himself himself and then today you know right before i got here we got the email that trump is
[2:52:14.600 --> 2:52:19.800]  actually going to accept the nomination in new hampshire to a live crowd so you know our guys
[2:52:19.800 --> 2:52:24.360]  got his groove back so that's really good news because he's in he's in charge now yeah and that
[2:52:24.360 --> 2:52:29.160]  everyone obsesses over kushner i don't know these good or bad i mean if trump likes him i like him
[2:52:29.160 --> 2:52:34.680]  kush are good he's a net he's a net win you know but boy is it frustrating and uh you know because
[2:52:34.680 --> 2:52:41.160]  trump is willing to ignore some of his instincts to you know listen to you know wise counsel but
[2:52:41.160 --> 2:52:47.080]  it's you know kushner's left of center you know but he's his son-in-law so he's you know we're not
[2:52:47.080 --> 2:52:55.000]  getting rid of him you know we just got to bake the cake what is trump's Achilles heel in the next
[2:52:55.000 --> 2:53:02.840]  67 days oh yikes i think that if trump ignores his base he loses i think that trump cannot ignore
[2:53:02.840 --> 2:53:07.560]  his base because the progressives on the left already feel that with camila harris and joe
[2:53:07.560 --> 2:53:12.680]  biden you know our friend roger stone calls this the ticket of mass incarceration and if trump
[2:53:12.680 --> 2:53:17.160]  just leans into that then the left doesn't even show up so but if i like roger's right trump needs
[2:53:17.160 --> 2:53:22.920]  to make a bigger deal about camila harris she's a bad cop a really really bad well he got mad at
[2:53:22.920 --> 2:53:27.720]  kushner going too far with justice reform right but that's one thing but to like point out that
[2:53:27.720 --> 2:53:31.640]  black people hate camila harris right why does she only pull like one percent with black folks two
[2:53:31.640 --> 2:53:37.560]  percent with whites i mean people really i've never seen she has an anti-black record she is a bad
[2:53:37.560 --> 2:53:43.080]  cop and i'm just gonna say it brock obama was white and african he was not african-american
[2:53:43.080 --> 2:53:48.760]  and african treat blacks very poorly they've got nicknames for us over in africa and even when
[2:53:48.760 --> 2:53:53.000]  they come here they treat us you know like you know like we're the foreign entity and they're the
[2:53:53.000 --> 2:53:57.080]  foreign entity and this is like the underbelly everybody knows this in the community you know
[2:53:57.080 --> 2:54:00.680]  it's the same it's the same way with asians and i don't know maybe i shouldn't be saying this but
[2:54:00.680 --> 2:54:06.040]  you know the chinese and and the japanese will treat people from from laos differently from
[2:54:06.040 --> 2:54:10.120]  thailand differently because they're darker and so this is just what happens people don't like
[2:54:10.120 --> 2:54:15.640]  camila harris because they know she's an indian they know that she's anti-black they know that
[2:54:15.640 --> 2:54:20.200]  she's locked up men longer than their sentences and she's just a bad cop she doesn't care well she
[2:54:20.200 --> 2:54:24.920]  knew people were innocent and kept them in jail on purpose to work for the state of california

[2:55:39.880 --> 2:55:46.840]  the new world order is a planetary corporate plan for world government but world government is
[2:55:46.840 --> 2:55:53.880]  only the control grid now inner members of the cult are told that they are going to transcend and
[2:55:53.880 --> 2:56:00.520]  become gods and attain immortality but the price for that is to carry out the orderly extermination
[2:56:00.520 --> 2:56:07.160]  of all carbon based line forms that's why they say carbon is bad they are rewriting the entire
[2:56:07.160 --> 2:56:14.840]  genetic code of the planet they are playing god they believe they have been inspired by interdimensional
[2:56:14.840 --> 2:56:21.960]  entities that are giving them advanced technology to carry out this transformation i know this sounds
[2:56:21.960 --> 2:56:29.800]  insane but if you read the writings of the globalist it's all on record you have been warned you have
[2:56:29.800 --> 2:56:36.920]  been given the information to say no to this plan this is the end of all life on earth as we know it
[2:56:36.920 --> 2:56:47.240]  this is the alien takeover of earth
[2:56:47.240 --> 2:57:05.720]  all right welcome to the alex jones show the alex jones show is the most powerful show in
[2:57:05.720 --> 2:57:12.600]  america today in the realm the world this is your host teacher today and i am hosting
[2:57:12.600 --> 2:57:17.400]  the fourth hour of the most powerful show in america today the alex jones show my name
[2:57:17.400 --> 2:57:23.320]  is bishop larry gators i am the host of the nationally and internationally syndicated radio
[2:57:23.320 --> 2:57:29.000]  show global spiritual revolution radio through the eye heart radio network in the eye heart
[2:57:29.000 --> 2:57:33.320]  media group also here in new york city new york and i'm also the host of global spiritual
[2:57:33.320 --> 2:57:40.680]  revolution radio through the live radio network 92.9 f m 14 60 a.m i want to talk about for the
[2:57:40.680 --> 2:57:51.880]  next 45 to 55 minutes a new cold war the global vaccination industrial complex again a brand new
[2:57:51.880 --> 2:57:59.560]  cold war the global vaccination industrial complex now remember one of the greatest historians
[2:57:59.560 --> 2:58:08.440]  in theologians in history a man by the name of barack day spinoza once said and i quote what altar of
[2:58:08.440 --> 2:58:18.520]  refuge can a man find himself when he commits treason against the majesty of reason let me
[2:58:18.520 --> 2:58:27.080]  say that again because that's a powerful comment what altar of refuge can a man find himself when
[2:58:27.080 --> 2:58:35.560]  he commits treason against the majesty of reason so then you and i are in the midst of the greatest
[2:58:35.560 --> 2:58:43.720]  global cover-up in human history not through the weapons of an atom or a hydrogen bomb you and i
[2:58:43.720 --> 2:58:52.120]  are eyewitnessing a present day takeover not just of our country but all of the 207
[2:58:52.120 --> 2:58:58.200]  nations upon the face of the earth through the global vaccinal industrial complex where we are
[2:58:58.200 --> 2:59:05.960]  told all 7.7 billion people upon the face of this planet are told to socially distance themselves
[2:59:05.960 --> 2:59:11.880]  by six feet now think about this number before we get into this vaccinal industrial conspiracy
[2:59:12.600 --> 2:59:20.840]  there are 7.7 billion people upon the face of this planet but we are told to socially distance
[2:59:20.840 --> 2:59:32.360]  ourselves by six feet or degrees from each other so 7.7 billion people times six feet equals 46
[2:59:32.360 --> 2:59:41.320]  billion two hundred million degrees of separation through sections what does that mean this year
[2:59:41.320 --> 2:59:49.240]  well look at the number 46 you and i have 46 chromosomes in our human genome 23 from the
[2:59:49.240 --> 2:59:57.000]  father 23 from the mother in genesis chapter three now in order for you and i to understand from a
[2:59:57.000 --> 3:00:04.600]  geopolitical and a scientific standpoint paradigm of what you and i are experiencing today
[3:00:04.600 --> 3:00:13.240]  through this scam called covid-19 we have to dissect this from a spiritual paradigm it's a
[3:00:13.240 --> 3:00:23.720]  spiritual factor so then 7.7 billion people times six feet from each other equals 46 billion 200
[3:00:23.720 --> 3:00:33.480]  million degrees of separation so in genesis chapter three verses one four and five the serpent
[3:00:33.480 --> 3:00:43.800]  speaks approximately 46 words to the woman called e you and i have 46 chromosomes 23 from the father
[3:00:43.800 --> 3:00:51.640]  23 from the mother so the in genesis chapter three verse one the serpent speaks 14 words to
[3:00:51.640 --> 3:00:59.880]  the woman chapter three verse four the serpent speaks five words to the woman in chapter three
[3:00:59.880 --> 3:01:12.120]  verse five the serpent speaks 27 words that's 46 words that the serpent spoke to the woman as we're
[3:01:12.120 --> 3:01:20.760]  talking about this 46 billion 200 million degrees of separation which equals about 7.7 billion people
[3:01:20.760 --> 3:01:27.720]  times six feet in circumference that which is also called not just social distancing
[3:01:27.720 --> 3:01:34.920]  but the gestalt theory now one may say i'm just laying the foundation here as we're talking about
[3:01:34.920 --> 3:01:42.600]  this new cold war the global and vaccination industrial complex a nazi clinical psychologist
[3:01:42.600 --> 3:01:51.080]  in 1930 a man by the name of dr kurt luan traveled from germany and came to stanford university
[3:01:51.080 --> 3:01:59.160]  to create the pericycology research institute that they specialize in mind control through lsd
[3:01:59.160 --> 3:02:07.480]  well what is the first letter of lucifer l satan s deva d this your lsd so to understand the global
[3:02:07.480 --> 3:02:16.120]  vaccinal industrial complex you cannot look at it from a geopolitical paradigm you have to look
[3:02:16.120 --> 3:02:22.840]  at it from a spiritual paradigm why because you and i are not fighting against flesh and blood
[3:02:23.400 --> 3:02:30.840]  you and i are not fighting against dr loto toning midget bounty and dr deva 3000 scarves burks and
[3:02:30.840 --> 3:02:40.360]  through dawn sweet tea lemon okay and through um all of the crack news network devils and through msm
[3:02:40.360 --> 3:02:49.640]  bc and rachel mad cow madel you and i are fighting against a invisible enemy like our great president
[3:02:49.640 --> 3:02:57.480]  said concerning this global vaccination industrial complex so 46 number for the fall of adam we did
[3:02:57.480 --> 3:03:04.120]  not have chromosomes you and i have chromosomes because of our contact with the surface but this
[3:03:04.120 --> 3:03:14.040]  of the 200 million well the number 200 is in enic chapter six where 200 fallen angels called a
[3:03:14.040 --> 3:03:24.680]  knock ins nut the lens or democidae may they pack a contract with lucifer satan the devil lsd
[3:03:24.680 --> 3:03:35.240]  and 10 percent of the 200 angels that were on mount herman the same mountain that jesus took
[3:03:35.240 --> 3:03:43.560]  peter's james and john called them out a transfiguration in matthew mark and luc and stayed for a
[3:03:43.560 --> 3:03:56.120]  protracted 20 days but yet in enic chapter six you got 20 names of the 200 angels which did
[3:03:56.120 --> 3:04:07.160]  infect humanity with a new cold war through genetic manipulation by the way it is called
[3:04:07.160 --> 3:04:15.960]  the global vaccinal industrial complex so that in order for you and i to understand this from a
[3:04:15.960 --> 3:04:25.160]  geopolitical and a scientific point of view we have to dissect it first from a spiritual view
[3:04:25.160 --> 3:04:35.800]  or a spiritual paradigm so this new cold war is one of vaccination but is through the prism of
[3:04:35.800 --> 3:04:44.840]  manipulation so then there are there is a three tier level of manipulation that you and i are
[3:04:44.840 --> 3:04:51.400]  experiencing not just here in america but around the world concerning this new cold war the global
[3:04:51.400 --> 3:04:59.800]  vaccinal industrial complex and this three tier level of manipulation is the manipulation of
[3:04:59.800 --> 3:05:10.040]  reality that's called eso kinesis the manipulation of time that's called chrono kinesis and the
[3:05:10.040 --> 3:05:20.920]  manipulation of probability that's called tycho kinesis well eso kinesis e chrono kinesis c
[3:05:20.920 --> 3:05:30.040]  tycho kinesis t that is not only the acronym for the term et cetera et cetera which in its
[3:05:30.040 --> 3:05:39.880]  origination or its origin is used by witches and warlocks to put hexes and curses on humanity
[3:05:39.880 --> 3:05:51.160]  but also this term et is an acronym for electro convulsive therapy so when we get back during
[3:05:51.160 --> 3:05:57.320]  the second part of today's show concerning the new cold war the global vaccination industrial
[3:05:57.320 --> 3:06:05.080]  complex we're we're going to get further into this global conspiracy of the origin the birth
[3:06:05.080 --> 3:06:14.920]  in the execution of this plan of the population through both manipulation and vaccination and
[3:06:14.920 --> 3:06:20.280]  so we'll see you guys here in the next three to five minutes on the most powerful show in america
[3:06:20.280 --> 3:06:28.040]  of the alex joneshow with your guest host teacher in moderated today bishop larry gators we see you

[3:06:47.480 --> 3:06:53.160]  implode the dollar and thrust the united states into a civil war by contesting the election

[3:07:18.120 --> 3:07:22.440]  things happen in history people are usually caught flat-footed because they can't believe

[3:08:59.480 --> 3:09:04.120]  welcome back to the most powerful show in america today the alex jones show
[3:09:04.120 --> 3:09:11.160]  show here with your guest host of the fourth hour of the alex jones show bishop larry gators
[3:09:11.160 --> 3:09:18.600]  and we are discussing with you guys today a new cold war on the global um you know manipulation
[3:09:18.600 --> 3:09:25.240]  not of just humanity but this global vaccinal industrial complex where they're used in the
[3:09:25.240 --> 3:09:34.040]  manipulation of reality isokinesis in time chronokinesis through the prism of the manipulation
[3:09:34.040 --> 3:09:42.760]  of probability that you and i call tycho kinesis so let's examine if you will the origins of the
[3:09:42.760 --> 3:09:52.120]  term of vaccination to understand vaccination i want you and i to look up a powerful book called
[3:09:52.120 --> 3:10:01.800]  edward jenner md okay english he was a english physician edward jenner md is by the author
[3:10:01.800 --> 3:10:14.840]  okay uh f daughtry drew wit capital t capital d r e w i t t so edward jenner md but the author
[3:10:14.840 --> 3:10:27.400]  uh is f daughtry capital d a w t r y drew wit capital d r e w i w t now you will see on the cover
[3:10:27.400 --> 3:10:35.560]  of that book uh dr edward jenner a sketch of his right arm on a tree lift and on the right hand
[3:10:35.560 --> 3:10:42.920]  side of dr edward jenner uh who may or may not be related to the jenner family out of hollywood
[3:10:42.920 --> 3:10:53.480]  uh it has a serpent behind him uh on this tree now again that's in the book edward jenner md
[3:10:53.480 --> 3:11:05.800]  by f daughtry d a w t r y drew wit capital d r e w i t t now you don't see the head of the serpent
[3:11:05.800 --> 3:11:16.760]  because the head of this serpent is dr edward jenner so the term vaccine was coin there you go
[3:11:16.760 --> 3:11:25.640]  so the life of edward jenner uh he was a naturalist and he was also the creator of the jenneran
[3:11:25.640 --> 3:11:34.360]  secret society uh funded by both the rock child dynasty in great britain through the royal secret
[3:11:34.360 --> 3:11:45.880]  society so in the 1700s the term here uh vaccine or vaccination was coined by dr edward jenner
[3:11:46.600 --> 3:11:55.480]  now the term vaccine is a combination of two persian words man i love teaching so the term
[3:11:55.480 --> 3:12:07.560]  vaccine capital v a double c i it means to genetically alter in persian so that's the
[3:12:07.560 --> 3:12:15.800]  of that guy not only means calpops but according to the persian lexicontext vaccine means to be
[3:12:15.800 --> 3:12:25.560]  genetically altered or change then we have the term nation so when we talk about vaccination
[3:12:26.120 --> 3:12:32.360]  concerning this new cold war the global vaccinal industrial complex through the prism
[3:12:32.920 --> 3:12:40.680]  of the manipulation of reality time and probability so vaccination simply means
[3:12:40.680 --> 3:12:51.880]  the genetically altering or the genetically manipulation of human dna human rna including
[3:12:51.880 --> 3:13:01.640]  non-human dna in rna to the nations that see nations so then according to the global lucifer
[3:13:01.640 --> 3:13:13.640]  in deep state their plan is to inoculate you well look at the term inoculate or in not can
[3:13:13.640 --> 3:13:24.040]  and this is where we also get the greek term in not can like in knocking keys now remember going
[3:13:24.040 --> 3:13:34.760]  back to the 15 and 1600s there was a high level witch and warlock by the name of john d whose
[3:13:34.760 --> 3:13:47.160]  moniker was 007 or two ball came from genesis chapter four verse 22 so he john d was a practitioner
[3:13:47.160 --> 3:13:57.400]  of isokinesis the manipulation of reality a practitioner of chronokinesis the manipulation
[3:13:57.400 --> 3:14:08.920]  of time through the prism of the manipulation of probability tycho kinesis so john d he had
[3:14:08.920 --> 3:14:18.040]  totally manipulated three levels of the british crown or throne now we talk about throne we're
[3:14:18.040 --> 3:14:27.560]  talking about not just a seat but a way of thinking so john d in the 1500s up until the time of his
[3:14:27.560 --> 3:14:39.320]  death in the early 1600s whose moniker was 007 had totally manipulated the reality time and
[3:14:39.320 --> 3:14:46.680]  probability of the kingdom of great britain as we're breaking down for you guys schematically
[3:14:47.400 --> 3:14:57.000]  this new cold war through the vaccinate national industrial complex now i want you students to
[3:14:57.000 --> 3:15:06.600]  write down these two words ochio capital o double c h i o which means a caustic i
[3:15:07.480 --> 3:15:21.160]  then the term nero in er o so the term ochio nero represents the ochio nero conspiracy wait a
[3:15:21.160 --> 3:15:30.600]  minute in the bishop what is the ochio nero conspiracy what is based upon the piscian
[3:15:30.600 --> 3:15:47.320]  conspiracy going back to 65 ad where a man a roman state senator by the name of gaius calpurnius
[3:15:47.320 --> 3:15:55.800]  pie so from which we get the term piscian conspiracy so then guys along with seven
[3:15:55.800 --> 3:16:06.920]  other state senators their job was to create an application of the throne of nero eight men
[3:16:06.920 --> 3:16:15.640]  because the term ochio or ochi is an italian word of meaning eight so not too long ago
[3:16:15.640 --> 3:16:23.160]  two years ago you had people like barack obama pope frances being backed by the global vatican
[3:16:23.160 --> 3:16:30.120]  system the present day prime minister and president of italy in the former prime minister
[3:16:30.120 --> 3:16:39.160]  and president of italy and including the black nobility of europe tried to create a present
[3:16:39.160 --> 3:16:48.360]  day piscian conspiracy by removing donald j trump but it did not succeed so then when
[3:16:48.360 --> 3:16:57.800]  we break down this global conspiracy not through the weapons of mass destruction like a adam
[3:16:57.800 --> 3:17:06.200]  or a hydrogen bomb you and i are living a truman show you remember the 1990 movie the truman show
[3:17:06.200 --> 3:17:14.200]  uh which um with uh carrie you know and jim carrie and i believe there was a man um that
[3:17:14.200 --> 3:17:22.760]  played the part of christoff named ed harris so then who is playing christoff today the global
[3:17:22.760 --> 3:17:32.440]  luciferian deep state whereas they're manipulating 7.7 ill truman burpings we see here in the next
[3:17:32.440 --> 3:17:48.840]  two to three minutes for the alex jones show the answer to 1984 is 1776
[3:17:50.360 --> 3:17:55.320]  info wars has been banned arrested
[3:17:55.320 --> 3:18:06.520]  attacked and threatened because we are effective the great awakening is here

[3:18:57.160 --> 3:19:03.080]  people about is coming true because it was all in the rockfeller foundation documents like lock step
[3:19:03.080 --> 3:19:09.640]  this is the corporate planetary takeover so yes i stand by what i said 10 years ago what i said a
[3:19:09.640 --> 3:19:14.760]  year ago and what i said last week more than ever get your high quality storeable foods at info

[3:19:44.840 --> 3:19:49.560]  they released covet or had the lockdown they already had this plan the rockfeller foundation
[3:19:50.120 --> 3:19:56.200]  and billa melinda gates it is beyond critical it is life and death for you and your family to
[3:19:56.200 --> 3:20:02.280]  understand about a real on the planet but this is a worldwide world government takeover on record
[3:20:02.280 --> 3:20:08.920]  that it's never going to end the united nations has admitted that first it's a month then it's six
[3:20:08.920 --> 3:20:14.360]  months then they say okay it's two years they're now saying two years they're now saying you'll never
[3:20:14.360 --> 3:20:20.680]  go back to normal no more gatherings no more anything constant force inoculations that they
[3:20:20.680 --> 3:20:27.320]  admit don't even work in the way they say they work they change your dna this is the culling
[3:20:27.320 --> 3:20:32.280]  of the planet this is the beginning of the straitjacket being put on you before you're slowly
[3:20:32.280 --> 3:20:58.760]  tortured to death and kill do you understand you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:20:58.760 --> 3:21:06.680]  welcome back to the alex jones show on the most powerful network in america and around the world
[3:21:06.680 --> 3:21:12.840]  in four wars here with your guest host for our fourth hour bishop larry gators we are talking
[3:21:12.840 --> 3:21:19.400]  about a new cold war the global vaccination industrial complex so the goal of the d state
[3:21:19.400 --> 3:21:27.640]  is to genetically alter our dna so that you and i have a hundred billion neurons in our brain
[3:21:27.640 --> 3:21:38.520]  and billions of cells in our genome so you and i had 37.2 trillion cells okay but yet
[3:21:38.520 --> 3:21:44.840]  who your biblical students um when we're talking about the points of a letter concerning the word
[3:21:44.840 --> 3:21:49.720]  of god let me tell you let me give you an example what a pointology is so let's say the letter c has
[3:21:49.720 --> 3:21:58.120]  one two points or the letter d has one two three or z has one two three four so the human genome
[3:21:58.120 --> 3:22:09.720]  has 37.2 trillion cells but there are 37.2 billion points of a letter in the word of the lord
[3:22:10.280 --> 3:22:19.640]  and jesus christ our savior and our soon coming king perform 37 miracles in the gospels that cannot
[3:22:19.640 --> 3:22:27.000]  be by accident as we're talking about this new cold war the global uh vaccinal industrial complex
[3:22:27.000 --> 3:22:37.240]  that every cell every gene every dna and rna strand in your body and mind represents a
[3:22:37.240 --> 3:22:45.160]  letter in the word of god so then that's why people like dr tonalota midget bouchie and dr
[3:22:45.160 --> 3:22:52.840]  deba 3000 scott's bergs okay through the media through don sweet tea lemon okay um through
[3:22:52.840 --> 3:23:02.600]  chris chris fredo quomo they're trying to manipulate the reality time and probability of america
[3:23:02.600 --> 3:23:09.640]  through vaccination so there's a family called the monsanto family now you know about the monsanto
[3:23:09.640 --> 3:23:19.640]  corporation that is has been genetically modified food through gmos for decades but the monsanto
[3:23:19.640 --> 3:23:31.400]  family uh began its bloodline in 1115 ad there was a man by the name of Pedro fernandez del castrol
[3:23:31.400 --> 3:23:43.400]  not monsanto castrol so Pedro fernandez del castrol was one of the grand masters of the
[3:23:43.400 --> 3:23:54.200]  order of centi algal okay which was a secret society both in portugal and spain and he founded
[3:23:54.200 --> 3:24:05.400]  a village in portugal called the monsanto village so during the 1400s the castrol bloodline that
[3:24:05.400 --> 3:24:17.080]  began 1115 ad through Pedro fernandez castrol that family changed their name from castrol to
[3:24:17.080 --> 3:24:27.640]  monsanto why because they wanted to escape the spanish inquisition through queen isabella
[3:24:27.640 --> 3:24:38.600]  during the 1400s and so then this monsanto family later was excommunicated out of dutch
[3:24:38.600 --> 3:24:47.720]  holland and out of the netherlands in 1757 through the edict of king charles the fifth in later
[3:24:47.720 --> 3:24:55.560]  king charles the sixth with the backing of the hapsburg empire including with the backing of
[3:24:55.560 --> 3:25:06.200]  the vatican global system why because the monsanto family even during the mid 1700s were genetically
[3:25:06.200 --> 3:25:16.120]  modifying their fruit and their vegetables poisoning eastern and central and western europe
[3:25:16.680 --> 3:25:25.240]  so they were escommunicated in 1757 isaac monsanto we're talking about this new cold war the global
[3:25:25.240 --> 3:25:32.600]  and vaccination industrial complex so to understand what's going on today we had to go back in its
[3:25:32.600 --> 3:25:40.760]  foundation of yesteryear to understand what's going on in the foreground so isaac monsanto
[3:25:40.760 --> 3:25:51.240]  quickly in 1757 his entire family was excommunicated out of holland and part of his family out of the
[3:25:51.240 --> 3:26:02.360]  netherlands including a friend of his by the name of moses lazarus now moses lazarus was not only a
[3:26:02.360 --> 3:26:11.560]  depopulationist but a brutal slave owner who then was excommunicated out of holland and out of the
[3:26:11.560 --> 3:26:17.880]  netherlands because of the inquisition of the dutch holland inquisition through the netherlands
[3:26:17.880 --> 3:26:27.080]  and moses lazarus family moved to south america then the south american government with the backing
[3:26:27.080 --> 3:26:37.000]  of the nation of portugal in spain excommunicated moses lazarus again this time out of central
[3:26:37.000 --> 3:26:45.720]  south america and the lazarus family moved to new york city where the daughter of moses lazarus
[3:26:45.720 --> 3:27:00.760]  was a communist a socialist a marxist who wrote a manifesto in 1883 concerning the great colossus
[3:27:00.760 --> 3:27:12.600]  or the new colossus that woman is emma lazarus emma lazarus her father was a brutal slave owner
[3:27:12.600 --> 3:27:19.960]  moses lazarus in south america and emma lazarus the one that said give me a tie your poor
[3:27:19.960 --> 3:27:28.040]  you're hungry yearning to be free she was a communist so the face of the statue of liberty
[3:27:28.760 --> 3:27:35.720]  was a communist and as a side note i'm not teaching race now that the original statue of liberty
[3:27:35.720 --> 3:27:43.160]  was a woman of color that the french gave to the analysis as a gift a woman who had a bible in her
[3:27:43.160 --> 3:27:48.680]  right hand and the ball broken ball and chain and her left but the global the global lucifer and
[3:27:48.680 --> 3:27:57.160]  deep state on the left these demon rats they didn't want that so they chose the face of emma lazarus
[3:27:57.160 --> 3:28:07.320]  as a con in its let's move on here so then the term that's a national now look at the corporations
[3:28:07.320 --> 3:28:21.400]  of bayer in i g farben now i g forman had created zycon b during the holocaust during the advent
[3:28:21.400 --> 3:28:33.080]  of world war two between 1933 and 1945 now the term here zycon okay when interpreted
[3:28:33.080 --> 3:28:42.280]  in persia this is going to blow your mind the persian interpretation for zycon is the term
[3:28:42.280 --> 3:28:55.880]  suit test write it down capital s u t e f suit tip means to liquidate ah so the term suit tip
[3:28:56.920 --> 3:29:03.800]  written from right the left because he brew and writings from the east is not written from left
[3:29:03.800 --> 3:29:12.760]  the right is written from right the left that term suit tip becomes the word fetus i want you
[3:29:12.760 --> 3:29:19.480]  to listen to me here as we're talking about this global vaccinal industrial complex through the
[3:29:19.480 --> 3:29:30.040]  prism of manipulation this new cold war so the term the persian term towards zycon is the term
[3:29:30.040 --> 3:29:40.600]  suit tip capital s u t e f which means to liquidate or fetus so then as we're talking about this
[3:29:40.600 --> 3:29:47.320]  global vaccinal industrial complex now what the bishop is about to teach you is going to blow
[3:29:47.320 --> 3:29:56.600]  your mind and we will be back here right after the break to go into this sinister global
[3:29:56.600 --> 3:30:05.560]  vaccinal plan of the population where the entire us food supply must be overhauled this is your
[3:30:05.560 --> 3:30:12.680]  guest host today on the alex joneshow as we're talking about this new cold war the global
[3:30:12.680 --> 3:30:19.720]  vaccinal industrial complex we will see you back here in about two to three minutes time on the alex
[3:30:19.720 --> 3:30:39.720]  joneshow info wars the democrats are just going more and more left many positive about socialism
[3:30:39.720 --> 3:30:46.360]  liking it more than capitalism many of the ideas we fought for that were considered radical on now
[3:30:46.360 --> 3:30:53.160]  mainstream the radical left has taken over the democratic party and joe biden is marching in
[3:30:53.160 --> 3:30:59.080]  lockstep with them biden and the far left are promising to crush middle-class families with
[3:30:59.080 --> 3:31:04.040]  trillions in new taxes that you let me your taxes are going to be raised not cut promising
[3:31:04.040 --> 3:31:10.600]  amnesty and healthcare for 11 million illegal immigrants citizenship for 11 million undocumented
[3:31:10.600 --> 3:31:16.680]  folks promising to shut down energy exploration killing jobs and hurting america's economy
[3:31:19.720 --> 3:31:26.440]  in joe biden's america the radical left get whatever they want and you get to pay for it
[3:31:26.440 --> 3:31:35.400]  they've already taken over joe biden and the democratic party don't let them take over america

[3:32:48.440 --> 3:32:54.280]  for a month here we are six months later then they start making people at colleges and at big
[3:32:54.280 --> 3:33:01.240]  corporations where wristbands showing that they've been quote contact traced and tested for covid
[3:33:01.240 --> 3:33:07.240]  then comes the apps on your phones and the global social credit score now being rolled out by virginia
[3:33:07.240 --> 3:33:12.520]  california and others it's not coming it's here and then the inoculations if you ever want to
[3:33:12.520 --> 3:33:18.840]  leave your house which amounts to force inoculations this is the medical tyranny takeover these are
[3:33:18.840 --> 3:33:24.520]  not classic vaccines that have their own problems these are dna vaccines that change your dna and
[3:33:24.520 --> 3:33:31.080]  are having massive serious side effects guaranteed this is about the population bill gates admits
[3:33:31.080 --> 3:33:37.240]  that this is an emergency resist or die the new world order is here when the corrupt establishment
[3:33:37.240 --> 3:33:43.720]  began pushing joe biden two years ago they knew he had serious cognitive problems he has always
[3:33:43.720 --> 3:33:49.640]  been an implicit that does what he's told by the globalist and their allied crime syndicates
[3:33:49.640 --> 3:33:55.000]  kamala harris is even worse and does whatever she's told she's bought and paid for by silicon
[3:33:55.000 --> 3:34:02.600]  valley the chai comms and others so she has been chosen because she's part african and now anyone
[3:34:02.600 --> 3:34:08.920]  that criticizes her will be called a racist and evil and she is now above reproach ladies and
[3:34:08.920 --> 3:34:15.320]  gentlemen we must expose this monster for who she is we must expose the fact that she wanted
[3:34:15.320 --> 3:34:20.920]  minimum sentences for black people three times longer than white people and that the woman is a
[3:34:20.920 --> 3:34:26.680]  monster kamala harris will end up being our president if they're able to steal the election
[3:34:26.680 --> 3:34:33.480]  and she is a 110 percent new world order puppet now more than ever we must expose this monster we
[3:34:33.480 --> 3:34:53.240]  must expose the globalist you're listening to the alex jones show welcome back to the alex
[3:34:53.240 --> 3:34:59.960]  jones show with your guest host don't know for the hour um bishop irrigators we have approximately
[3:34:59.960 --> 3:35:04.920]  10 to 12 minutes left we're talking about this new cold war of the global vaccination
[3:35:04.920 --> 3:35:11.160]  or industrial complex here on the most powerful show in america today the alex jones show here
[3:35:11.160 --> 3:35:16.040]  with your guest host during the fourth hour bishop irrigators now i want you to type in
[3:35:16.040 --> 3:35:24.920]  um the following words products that use aborted fetuses or just something um products that use
[3:35:24.920 --> 3:35:35.640]  aborted fetuses or go to uh hli.org or human life international hli.org or human life international
[3:35:35.640 --> 3:35:48.280]  now at least 70 to 75 percent of the food supply in our country is tainted with the skin in the
[3:35:48.280 --> 3:35:56.360]  tissue of aborted fetuses so then there is a vaccination put out through the medical research
[3:35:56.360 --> 3:36:03.000]  council out of the uk now the medical research council out of the uk was created in 1913
[3:36:03.000 --> 3:36:09.560]  uh one year prior to the advent of world war one it was created by the purbine institute the same
[3:36:09.560 --> 3:36:15.480]  institute that um the bill and melinda romelliams gates foundation uh support in the millions of
[3:36:15.480 --> 3:36:26.360]  dollars so then the medical research council has created a what they call an mrc five uh dip
[3:36:26.360 --> 3:36:38.120]  lord human cell line strain which is the composition of tissue of the brain tissue in the heart tissue
[3:36:39.160 --> 3:36:48.280]  of dead aborted fetuses that they want to use under the trojan horse of covet 19 vaccination
[3:36:48.280 --> 3:37:00.600]  also you have the human embryonic kidney 293 cell line that was created also through the medical
[3:37:00.600 --> 3:37:06.920]  research council out of england and i said quick side note when you go to the medical research
[3:37:06.920 --> 3:37:12.520]  council that's an excellent link there when you guys go to the medical research council
[3:37:12.520 --> 3:37:19.240]  the powerful listeners of the alex joneshell known as the logo at the top left hand corner
[3:37:19.800 --> 3:37:27.560]  of the medical research council in the color of the medical research council and compare that to
[3:37:27.560 --> 3:37:38.520]  the present day dnc national convention logo which has the same colors that also has a five
[3:37:38.520 --> 3:37:47.320]  pointed hexagram and pentagram so that cannot be by accident so the logo of the medical research
[3:37:47.320 --> 3:37:56.840]  council and the logo of the democratic national convention logo that has a five pointed hexagram
[3:37:56.840 --> 3:38:07.960]  and pentagram absolute that represents the five pointed system about foment which means solve et
[3:38:07.960 --> 3:38:17.080]  coagulation that's also tattooed on the forearm of the british writer jk rolin so then the human
[3:38:17.080 --> 3:38:26.440]  embryonic kidney cell 293 cell strain which is in the form of not just vaccination for covet 19
[3:38:27.240 --> 3:38:34.520]  but it is also excellent length there thank you it's also an artificial flavoring
[3:38:35.320 --> 3:38:43.000]  in coffee made creamers wait a minute now so when we talk about this new cold war on the global
[3:38:43.000 --> 3:38:49.240]  vaccination industrial complex excellent length there guys notice the logo of the dnc the five
[3:38:49.240 --> 3:38:57.880]  point about the met a sign of a hexagram or a pentagram representing the five senses of darkness
[3:38:57.880 --> 3:39:08.440]  of sight on hearing smell taste and touch so then also there is another diploid cell by the name of
[3:39:08.440 --> 3:39:19.880]  perc six that was created by the purd right institute in 1985 also made out of the cell
[3:39:19.880 --> 3:39:29.160]  tissues of aborted children and also out of the tissues of dead rats women i'm confused now so the
[3:39:29.160 --> 3:39:37.720]  global vaccination industrial complex has not only infected the medical industry through the arms
[3:39:37.720 --> 3:39:44.520]  rates through this global vaccinal industrial complex pushed by the purd right institute
[3:39:44.520 --> 3:39:53.320]  pushed by novartis ag pushed by the wuhan institute of biotechnology biology and the wuji
[3:39:53.320 --> 3:40:08.040]  pharma app tech and pushed by elie lily all of their subsidiary addresses in china is 666 goldson road
[3:40:08.040 --> 3:40:14.840]  why would elie lily be at the address which is the epicenter of covet 19 why would johnson and
[3:40:14.840 --> 3:40:25.320]  johnson be at that address uh at 666 goldson road so we're talking about the global um vaccinal
[3:40:25.320 --> 3:40:37.640]  industrial complex so mrc five h ek 293 perc six which is a human cell line uh and according to the
[3:40:37.640 --> 3:40:51.640]  european medicine's agency in 2009 they said and i quote there are approximately 3000 diploid cell
[3:40:51.640 --> 3:40:59.640]  culture lines but how many species do we have a surface and snakes throughout the world 3000
[3:41:00.280 --> 3:41:07.080]  do you think that that is by accident as we're exposing this global vaccinal industrial complex
[3:41:07.080 --> 3:41:17.880]  and then you have the dtp vaccinal immunization vaccine called tetanus pertissis okay on tetanus
[3:41:17.880 --> 3:41:29.080]  diphtheria diphtheria tetanus and pertissis which is a combination also of dead cells from dead
[3:41:29.080 --> 3:41:38.840]  aborted fetuses that's injected in your children uh to protect them from measles and mumps okay
[3:41:38.840 --> 3:41:45.960]  and every other disease wait a minute now so they're injecting your children with the cells
[3:41:45.960 --> 3:41:56.040]  of dead aborted fetuses but guess what mrc five h ek 293 the human embryonic kidney cell 293 cell
[3:41:56.040 --> 3:42:07.320]  strength perc six okay including the ht 10 80 cell lines and h u h seven cell lines and dtp
[3:42:07.960 --> 3:42:16.920]  on diphtheria tetanus and pertissis cell lines or also injected in the part of your food supply
[3:42:16.920 --> 3:42:25.800]  frito lays chips i'm i'm telling you ruckles chips okay it's all of these ingredients in your
[3:42:25.800 --> 3:42:33.960]  coffee made creamers hog and dawns ice cream ben and jerry's listen to me well what's your
[3:42:33.960 --> 3:42:44.040]  saying bishop that we have been drinking the liquid substance of aborted fetuses for decades
[3:42:44.040 --> 3:42:53.000]  that's exactly what i'm saying you're dealing with a group of psychopaths and sociopaths mainly
[3:42:53.000 --> 3:43:00.280]  people like kamala hairs where she got where she was because kamala hairs laid on her back now i'm
[3:43:00.280 --> 3:43:07.480]  not disrespecting women i'm just exposing kamala hairs in her connection to this new cold war the
[3:43:07.480 --> 3:43:14.280]  global vaccinate national industrial complex and both of her parents her father of jamaican dissent
[3:43:14.280 --> 3:43:20.040]  nothing against jamaican people and her mother of indian dissent nothing against indian people
[3:43:20.040 --> 3:43:29.160]  and as a side note there is a beverage in both indian pakistan called bovine salt drink cup with
[3:43:29.160 --> 3:43:42.360]  bovine there are two additives okay called soviet sodium benzente sodium benzente with the isamid
[3:43:42.360 --> 3:43:50.360]  and gum arabic partly that comes from the archaeotry 90 percent of the salt drinks not all
[3:43:50.360 --> 3:44:01.400]  but 90 percent come from of the urine of camels and cows i kid you're not the year this is the
[3:44:01.400 --> 3:44:08.840]  reason why yellow mellow is called yellow mellow and mountain dew is called mountain dew because
[3:44:08.840 --> 3:44:18.120]  these drinks are laced with sugars in order to hide this conspiracy and in my conclusion here today
[3:44:18.120 --> 3:44:25.080]  in my conclusion 80 percent of the children of the world are under this what we call this
[3:44:25.080 --> 3:44:32.440]  vaccination well the term the latin term for vaccinate is the word lucificate
[3:44:33.480 --> 3:44:43.480]  the notice the term vaccinate is the term lucificate or to lucify or to lucification
[3:44:43.480 --> 3:44:56.840]  which means to genetically replicate to lucify to lucificate to luciferous your dna and mine
[3:44:56.840 --> 3:45:03.960]  and this is the end of the new cold war the global vaccination industrial complex share
[3:45:03.960 --> 3:45:08.760]  this power for teaching to every person on the face of the earth i love you brother alex you
[3:45:08.760 --> 3:45:15.000]  are a mentor of mine and to all of the staff we love you and we see you here soon on the alex
[3:45:15.000 --> 3:45:40.520]  jones show with fish and barricades god bless you
