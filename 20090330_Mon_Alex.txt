[00:32.840 --> 00:41.120]  for joining us we are live March 30th 2009 on this Monday edition from 11 30
[00:41.120 --> 00:46.320]  until 12 30 on the second half of the first hour the first half of the second
[00:46.320 --> 00:49.720]  hour Webster Griffin Tarbley before he goes and jumps on an airplane down the
[00:49.720 --> 00:54.000]  road few hours from now will be in studio with us he's down here for the second
[00:54.000 --> 00:58.560]  Obama film I'm interviewing him and others we've got Webster Tarbley to be in
[00:58.560 --> 01:02.840]  studio coming up in 30 minutes he was obviously with me yesterday on the Sunday
[01:02.840 --> 01:07.680]  abbreviated transmission very informative then coming up in an hour and a
[01:07.680 --> 01:13.200]  half from Sacramento California they've also been in Los Angeles visiting the
[01:13.200 --> 01:18.960]  tent cities they barely missed Arnold Schwarzenegger yesterday surveying one of
[01:18.960 --> 01:24.880]  the tent cities outside Sacramento with the mayor out there saying this is going
[01:24.880 --> 01:29.880]  to be tough love tough love we're going to kick you out of here and make you go
[01:29.880 --> 01:37.080]  to the fairgrounds to live behind barbed wire under police and CPS control so
[01:37.080 --> 01:40.880]  quite a precedent being set there and I've got a team out there on the scene
[01:40.880 --> 01:46.040]  so Rob do and Jason Douglas will be joining us in an hour and a half from
[01:46.040 --> 01:49.880]  the camp we also have a lady who has an organization that tracks the abuse of
[01:49.880 --> 01:54.800]  prisoners in jails but not just the physical abuse but the medical abuse
[01:54.800 --> 02:00.320]  and also how some of their diets consist of close to 60 70 percent of soy
[02:00.320 --> 02:04.760]  filled with estrogen and the health problems the men are having are
[02:04.760 --> 02:09.320]  having are just absolutely off the chart of course most of school children are
[02:09.320 --> 02:13.560]  eating close to half soy so that's one reason the boys are so effeminate and
[02:13.560 --> 02:17.720]  just so happens the plastic that we drink out of the most popular plastic
[02:17.720 --> 02:21.800]  leeches estrogen so it hyper feminizes the girls going into puberty now at age
[02:21.800 --> 02:27.040]  three used to be age 14 then 10 then 9 and 8 now seven now hundreds of
[02:27.040 --> 02:32.920]  thousands in the in the West in age three to four so we'll be breaking that
[02:32.920 --> 02:37.400]  down in the last hour of the show today I talked to the we are changed folks in
[02:37.400 --> 02:42.320]  New York some yesterday Rob Jacobson talked to them Luke's being arraigned
[02:42.320 --> 02:46.200]  in court right now we're working on getting some of those guys if not Luke
[02:46.200 --> 02:52.160]  on the show later popping in he went to a hotel you know that has bars and
[02:52.160 --> 02:56.840]  restaurants it's advertised as if it's public Bloomberg secured people said
[02:56.840 --> 03:00.560]  stay here the police came they didn't say leave they said you're arrested for
[03:00.560 --> 03:05.560]  trespassing and so we did an emergency broadcast on that Saturday night when
[03:05.560 --> 03:08.840]  they gave us the call happened to be up here in the studio so it wasn't on the
[03:08.840 --> 03:12.480]  AM and FM dial we had a couple thousand people listening to the rebroadcast and
[03:12.480 --> 03:18.120]  kind of the dead time on Saturday night but the that group is a nucleus of people
[03:18.120 --> 03:21.880]  got the word out all over the web and their phones have been busy for days at
[03:21.880 --> 03:27.480]  the 18th precinct the reason we did that is they were also telling me boy you're
[03:27.480 --> 03:31.120]  impersonating the press you know you don't we are changes in press info wars
[03:31.120 --> 03:34.580]  dot com is impressed because he's a freelance reporter for us I called the
[03:34.580 --> 03:38.040]  police up and I said no I mean that's a syndicated radio show he does do
[03:38.040 --> 03:42.440]  reporting for us and they said no it you know it isn't hung up on us so one of
[03:42.440 --> 03:45.760]  them to know know the people of America are watching this and what you do with
[03:45.760 --> 03:49.320]  Luke so we appreciate everybody who made those phone calls and did that they
[03:49.320 --> 03:54.880]  arrested two other people as well so we'll get Matt LePasic or Sabrina Rivera
[03:54.880 --> 03:59.360]  or maybe even Luke if he's out today who knows with these court trials sometimes
[03:59.360 --> 04:01.840]  they bring him in to be a rain there's too many in front of them and so you get
[04:01.840 --> 04:06.360]  put back in the back in the clink back in the who's gal back in the back in the
[04:06.360 --> 04:14.040]  jail cell but quite a system where they say you're trespassing you know the
[04:14.040 --> 04:18.640]  New York police lost several thousand lawsuits total just in 2004 from the
[04:18.640 --> 04:22.760]  2004 RNC where they would just scoop people off the sidewalk saying it was
[04:22.760 --> 04:27.120]  trespassing and whenever Luke goes out on the sidewalk in front of building
[04:27.120 --> 04:31.120]  seven the new building seven Larry Silverstein and talks about how 9-11's an
[04:31.120 --> 04:34.680]  inside job they have private security thugs would the police come out and say
[04:34.680 --> 04:38.280]  you know that this street belongs to Silverstein and the road belongs to
[04:38.280 --> 04:42.480]  Silverstein even though it's city property and Port Authority and we're
[04:42.480 --> 04:46.360]  gonna say your cameras a gun your backpacks a bomb we know it isn't but
[04:46.360 --> 04:50.040]  we're gonna say it is you're gonna spend 30 days in jail as a terrorist before we
[04:50.040 --> 04:54.640]  find out you weren't one so this is the type of criminality and they've now done
[04:54.640 --> 05:01.400]  this to Luke Radowski all right a ton of news straight ahead stay with us companies
[05:01.400 --> 05:06.040]  continue to lay off thousands of people unemployment is the highest it's been in

[08:42.440 --> 08:48.440]  studio he's got a lot of analysis and information on the takeover of Detroit
[08:48.440 --> 08:54.640]  the basic IMF World Bank shock therapy that Barack Obama is carrying out
[08:54.640 --> 08:59.000]  against them he just finished a speech about 30 minutes ago Obama unveils a
[08:59.000 --> 09:04.440]  new plan for auto industry president wants painful concessions as price of
[09:04.440 --> 09:11.240]  industries survival also today's target Detroit White House is playing serious
[09:11.240 --> 09:16.480]  whole ball hardball for the first time with its recovery cash that's right the
[09:16.480 --> 09:21.280]  bankers can have upwards of 12 trillion but if the auto industry needs 20 30 40
[09:21.280 --> 09:25.440]  billion they're just loans no you've got to basically sell out to the foreigners
[09:25.440 --> 09:29.200]  and fiat and then basically fire most your employees and cut back on the
[09:29.200 --> 09:32.640]  number of cars you make and don't make any gas puzzlers anymore only make what
[09:32.640 --> 09:35.720]  the government tells you to manufacture you know obama says this isn't the
[09:35.720 --> 09:40.080]  government taking over GM but it really is GM boss steps down at White House
[09:40.080 --> 09:44.320]  request so you now have the White House of firing whoever they want basically
[09:44.320 --> 09:49.040]  Fritz Henderson GM president and chief operating officer to take over notice
[09:49.040 --> 09:52.880]  what happened in the two days after they passed the October 3rd banker takeover
[09:52.880 --> 09:59.200]  bill five and a half months ago that Obama and Geithner and Bush honchoed
[09:59.200 --> 10:06.040]  together along with Paulson and Bernanke and Paul Adolf Volcker noticed that
[10:06.040 --> 10:11.080]  they immediately shifted to yeah these bailouts are terrible socialism do we
[10:11.080 --> 10:20.080]  give 20 billion to GM or 20 billion to Chrysler as loans and it all shifted into
[10:20.080 --> 10:23.160]  a national debate about that kind of like there's a national debate about a
[10:23.160 --> 10:28.400]  hundred and sixty five hundred and sixty eight million in AIG bonuses instead
[10:28.400 --> 10:31.840]  of talking about the 12 trillion that's disappeared into the shareholders black
[10:31.840 --> 10:39.480]  hole to pay out these derivatives so big news there on that front you know
[10:39.480 --> 10:43.520]  Geithner seeking a new bill for powers they can grab corporations insurance
[10:43.520 --> 10:47.960]  companies other banks but not just the financial sector so we'll be talking
[10:47.960 --> 10:55.200]  about that today with Webster Tarpley in studio also last week there was a house
[10:55.200 --> 11:00.120]  and Senate version of the give act that had multiple sections of language of
[11:00.120 --> 11:04.480]  setting up a federal agency to carry out compulsory national service through
[11:04.480 --> 11:11.560]  mera core secure core green core senior core environs core security core 18 to
[11:11.560 --> 11:17.480]  25 three months a year of paramilitary training as in his book and speeches the
[11:17.480 --> 11:22.760]  White House chief of staff promised that he would do a manual slavery those
[11:22.760 --> 11:29.200]  were pulled out in the final version thank God what on by Wednesday we
[11:29.200 --> 11:31.960]  discovered that by Thursday we've been reading the bills over the weekend
[11:31.960 --> 11:38.040]  hurt nemo thanks to listeners sending us the another bill and there's several
[11:38.040 --> 11:44.080]  others in a story titled mandatory service bill lives on at info wars.com
[11:44.080 --> 11:48.880]  it's also on prison planet.com has the exact same language that was in the
[11:48.880 --> 11:53.040]  house and Senate version of the give act and so you can go to the bill and we're
[11:53.040 --> 11:56.080]  going to give you the subsection right now to read this we need to put pressure
[11:56.080 --> 11:59.920]  on them again to have them pull it out yet again and they will continue to
[11:59.920 --> 12:02.960]  introduce bills look to fight and fight and fight and fight and then if they
[12:02.960 --> 12:08.380]  pass the draft the mandatory takeover of society indentured servitude slavery
[12:08.380 --> 12:13.960]  bondage serfdom feudalism if they're able to do this we need to then fight
[12:13.960 --> 12:18.120]  its implementation and say no no no and that's where civil disobedience comes
[12:18.120 --> 12:23.800]  in mandatory service bill lives on it seemed like a victory of sorts last week
[12:23.800 --> 12:27.440]  the Senate approved a bill to radically expand the AmeriCorps program the bill
[12:27.440 --> 12:31.000]  initially contained language that proposed a study for mandatory service
[12:31.000 --> 12:35.360]  for all young people in the United States and listed bunch of other stuff too
[12:35.360 --> 12:39.560]  but this language was removed as the bill moved through the Senate it did not
[12:39.560 --> 12:46.120]  appear in the final version well it's back the language was stripped from one
[12:46.120 --> 12:54.560]  bill but it suddenly appeared in another it is now contained in HR 1 4 4 4 HR 1
[12:54.560 --> 13:02.000]  4 4 4 due to crawl across the House floor this week the end of March going
[13:02.000 --> 13:08.780]  into April HR 1 4 4 4 is sponsored by Representative Jim McDermott a Washington
[13:08.780 --> 13:13.920]  State Democrat and is assigned to the House committee on labor and education
[13:13.920 --> 13:23.600]  the bill under section 4 b6 states now listen it's HR House resolution 1 4 4
[13:23.600 --> 13:42.240]  4 is the bill the subsection is 4 b6 of 1 4 4 4 section 4 b6 and it's the exact
[13:42.240 --> 13:46.240]  same language from the give act but the give act also another language about
[13:46.240 --> 13:50.800]  another section for the Secure Corps the Environmental Corps the Green Corps the
[13:50.800 --> 13:56.760]  Security Corps the Senior Corps whether a workable fair and responsible
[13:56.760 --> 14:03.400]  mandatory service requirement mandatory service requirement for all able young
[14:03.400 --> 14:07.760]  people should be developed and how such a requirement total federalization could
[14:07.760 --> 14:11.920]  be implemented in a manner that would strengthen the social fabric of the
[14:11.920 --> 14:18.120]  nation and overcome civic challenges by bringing together people from diverse
[14:18.120 --> 14:21.800]  economic ethnic and educational backgrounds is basically reeducation in
[14:21.800 --> 14:25.080]  the schools middle school high school and then inducted into the military
[14:25.080 --> 14:29.920]  training how mandatory service ie servitude strengthens the social fabric
[14:29.920 --> 14:38.360]  of the nation is not explained HR 1 4 4 4 like its earlier parent 1388 includes
[14:38.360 --> 14:43.200]  the prospect of a public service academy a four-year institution that offers a
[14:43.200 --> 14:47.480]  federally funded undergraduate education so they're going to pay for this but say
[14:47.480 --> 14:50.440]  you have to do it so that's the argument we're being paid to be you know to do
[14:50.440 --> 14:55.400]  what we say with a focus on training the future public sector leaders and reaches
[14:55.400 --> 14:58.840]  all the way down the primary school requiring a review of the means to
[14:58.840 --> 15:04.760]  develop awareness of national service and voluntary opportunities at a young
[15:04.760 --> 15:09.200]  age by creating expanding and promoting service options for primary and
[15:09.200 --> 15:12.800]  secondary school students and by raising awareness of existing incentives
[15:12.800 --> 15:17.760]  that is existing incentives is determined by the government in addition to
[15:17.760 --> 15:22.000]  obama's election campaign pledged to create a 250,000 strong national
[15:22.000 --> 15:27.560]  security forces big powerful and well-funded as our combined us military
[15:27.560 --> 15:32.880]  forces obama's chief of staff or manual has offered a book the plan they got is
[15:32.880 --> 15:37.520]  for america that calls for three months of compulsory civil service for all
[15:37.520 --> 15:43.680]  americans ages 18 to 25 so it looks like the goblin of compulsory national
[15:43.680 --> 15:47.600]  service has not gone away it is simply morphed into another bill soon to be
[15:47.600 --> 15:53.280]  considered by the house representatives one thing is for certain the federal
[15:53.280 --> 15:57.440]  government considers you and your children a little more than ciphers to be
[15:57.440 --> 16:01.640]  pressed ganged in the mandatory service to the government addicted to wars wage
[16:01.640 --> 16:06.840]  in the name of international bankers and that nexus is in to the pentagon
[16:06.840 --> 16:13.400]  civil army that will serve domestically and overseas and that's 1404 point 10
[16:13.400 --> 16:19.760]  in the army issued directives pentagon issued directives excuse me so that is
[16:19.760 --> 16:22.680]  some of what we have there
[16:23.280 --> 16:27.520]  associated press fox news canadian free pass and others reported what we
[16:27.520 --> 16:31.920]  reported last year but it's now broken into mainstream news obama's involvement
[16:31.920 --> 16:37.120]  in chicago climate exchange the rest of the story he got federal funding while
[16:37.120 --> 16:41.280]  he was a state senator and invested in some of his own money in what they call
[16:41.280 --> 16:48.400]  the largest carbon trading operation in the world now based in chicago there is
[16:48.400 --> 16:58.520]  a another firm the largest in europe called gore and blood and associates we
[16:58.520 --> 17:05.960]  like to call it blood and gore and that's between mr. gore and of course
[17:05.960 --> 17:10.480]  mr. blood who owns the company they set it up he also owns the controlling
[17:10.480 --> 17:18.520]  stock al gore does in occidental petroleum he's an oilman and in that
[17:18.520 --> 17:26.080]  i was happening with it he literally says oh i pay carbon offsets for my
[17:26.080 --> 17:30.840]  10,000 square foot house and for all my jet travel and all this baloney but he
[17:30.840 --> 17:36.880]  pays it into his own company so it's another ponzi scheme another scam on the
[17:36.880 --> 17:44.360]  order of made-off so i just thought we would go over the fact that good news to
[17:44.360 --> 17:48.040]  know the truth will always out even if you're barack obama this other canadian
[17:48.040 --> 17:53.280]  free press obama years ago helped fund carbon progress the carbon program he is
[17:53.280 --> 17:57.520]  now pushing through congress is a fox news story by ed barns and short while on
[17:57.520 --> 18:01.520]  the board of the chicago base charity barack obama help fund a carbon trading
[18:01.520 --> 18:05.440]  exchange that will likely play a critical role in the cap and trade carbon
[18:05.440 --> 18:08.320]  reduction program he's now trying to push through congress as president talk
[18:08.320 --> 18:13.840]  about conflict of interest the charity was the joist foundation on whose board
[18:13.840 --> 18:17.920]  of directors obama served and which gave nearly one point one million in two
[18:17.920 --> 18:21.880]  separate grants that were instrumental in developing and launching the privately
[18:21.880 --> 18:26.000]  owned chicago climate exchange which now calls itself north america's only cap
[18:26.000 --> 18:29.920]  and trade system for all six greenhouse gases with global affiliates and
[18:29.920 --> 18:34.040]  projects worldwide that's from their website and that's all the beginning of
[18:34.040 --> 18:38.280]  this toddry tale of mr barns a privately owned chicago climate exchange is
[18:38.280 --> 18:43.240]  heavily influenced by obama's cohorts al gore and marie strong for years now
[18:43.240 --> 18:47.440]  strong and gore have been cashing in on the lucrative cottage industry known as
[18:47.440 --> 18:51.320]  man-made global warming which they've just turned into another derivative and
[18:51.320 --> 18:55.920]  even if you think greenhouse gases are deadly this doesn't reduce them so that's
[18:55.920 --> 18:58.720]  some of the news i have here here's one of the london telegraph got a lot of
[18:58.720 --> 19:04.920]  this ahead of the g twenty coming up in a few days he's got a first go is the
[19:04.920 --> 19:10.120]  first sitting president for an audience and speaking curtsy bowell and people
[19:10.120 --> 19:12.440]  that were doubting he would do this here's one telegraph
[19:12.440 --> 19:18.920]  barack obama's team repair etiquette and gifts for presidents meeting with the
[19:18.920 --> 19:21.920]  creature known as queen elizabeth i didn't say this is barack obama's team
[19:21.920 --> 19:25.520]  repair etiquette and gifts for presidents meeting with the queen
[19:25.520 --> 19:30.720]  disgusting queen hereditary ruler i mean how how disgusting is this
[19:30.720 --> 19:33.800]  and remember the white house a few weeks ago he said teddy kennedy sir teddy
[19:33.800 --> 19:37.880]  kennedy you know and he's all a knight in everything top advisors of barack obama
[19:37.880 --> 19:40.320]  are rehearsing the adequate and debating
[19:40.320 --> 19:42.960]  what gifts the president will give the queen elizabeth when he meets the
[19:42.960 --> 19:44.800]  british monarch in london
[19:44.800 --> 19:48.640]  london telegraph totally and absolutely disgusting so he's he's practicing on a

[19:58.080 --> 20:02.000]  the world
[20:02.000 --> 20:05.600]  with our economy spiraling out of control living in the soup kitchens
[20:05.600 --> 20:09.680]  maybe right around the corner no one saw the financial collapse of nineteen
[20:09.680 --> 20:14.160]  twenty nine many didn't make it and millions ended up in soup lines becoming
[20:14.160 --> 20:16.560]  vagrants begging for food

[24:35.760 --> 24:38.160]  members
[24:41.200 --> 24:44.800]  you know there's a lot of side issues i want to get into
[24:44.800 --> 24:49.120]  today just the way people's minds work on the
[24:49.120 --> 24:53.120]  internet and the and the fact that it doesn't frustrate me
[24:53.120 --> 24:58.320]  that they are attacking me it frustrates me that they don't understand
[24:58.320 --> 25:02.880]  how the world works and so later on prisonplanet.tv if i have time i'm gonna
[25:02.880 --> 25:08.080]  play this clip it says my problem with alex jones
[25:08.080 --> 25:15.680]  and it's a guy on youtube and he basically says i made zeitgeist
[25:15.680 --> 25:20.640]  and it's an anti christian anti religious film i did not make zeitgeist
[25:20.640 --> 25:24.400]  zeitgeist without my permission used lengthy clips
[25:24.400 --> 25:28.800]  of terror storm in game other films
[25:28.800 --> 25:31.520]  and put it in there now after the fact the guy
[25:31.520 --> 25:34.480]  ever been out for six months called up and said well my stuff's in here is that
[25:34.480 --> 25:38.640]  okay and i said whatever man i you know i had no idea what he was going to turn
[25:38.640 --> 25:42.320]  into down the road last week he was in the
[25:42.320 --> 25:45.760]  new york times the maker of it saying he doesn't like
[25:45.760 --> 25:51.280]  911 truth now we're basically bad people so i mean for all of you out there
[25:51.280 --> 25:54.080]  that were totally suckered by the zeitgeist thing
[25:54.080 --> 25:59.200]  it is a globalist system calling for utopian world run by a computer
[25:59.200 --> 26:03.280]  literally and he said on air when i debated him that well yes alex you'll
[26:03.280 --> 26:07.040]  be reeducated and then i'm the bad guy because i don't
[26:07.040 --> 26:10.720]  want to be reeducated and i'm not intellectual enough to be able to grasp
[26:10.720 --> 26:14.800]  the you know greater systems the new order and then i constantly i get emails
[26:14.800 --> 26:19.200]  every day phone calls websites attacking me that i made zeitgeist
[26:19.200 --> 26:23.360]  look i did not make zeitgeist i had nothing to do
[26:23.360 --> 26:28.400]  with the production of it and overall again it comes in with an anti christian
[26:28.400 --> 26:32.240]  anti religious view then it gets in to the new world order
[26:32.240 --> 26:36.880]  government sponsored terror and it's woken up a lot of people
[26:36.880 --> 26:40.240]  and so that's why i didn't really attack the film you know people have their
[26:40.240 --> 26:43.760]  free speech but i'm tired of being associated
[26:43.760 --> 26:47.360]  with people i'm not
[26:47.360 --> 26:52.960]  and it's intellectually not fair you know the latest thing happened last week
[26:52.960 --> 26:56.800]  a very prominent individual linked to stories that basically said i murdered
[26:56.800 --> 26:59.760]  william cooper you know now it's not just that
[26:59.760 --> 27:04.480]  i i uh there was some rift between me and william cooper
[27:04.480 --> 27:10.320]  now now it's basically i had him killed and people have to expect me to stand up
[27:10.320 --> 27:14.400]  to him when they do stuff like that um
[27:14.400 --> 27:18.480]  because you know if some little side website or something
[27:18.480 --> 27:22.800]  comes out and makes a bunch of lies and does things like that it's one thing but
[27:22.800 --> 27:27.840]  but people i've supported people i've helped people i've promoted
[27:27.840 --> 27:31.920]  doing things to me like that i won't put up with
[27:32.480 --> 27:39.440]  and it expands out from there you know william cooper himself
[27:39.440 --> 27:42.720]  put out an email in the late 90s saying i'm in deep trouble i think was like
[27:42.720 --> 27:46.240]  98 i'm in deep trouble the IRS is coming after me i need
[27:46.240 --> 27:48.240]  help so i called him up had him on the radio
[27:48.240 --> 27:52.480]  tried to raising money tried to get support for him and then
[27:52.480 --> 27:55.840]  he then did radio shows where he claimed i was a transvestite
[27:55.840 --> 28:02.320]  that wore uh what was the exact quote he said it was documented that i wear
[28:02.320 --> 28:06.720]  ruby nipple rings i mean just completely made up you know i don't wear ruby
[28:06.720 --> 28:09.840]  nipple rings i didn't kill william cooper
[28:09.840 --> 28:13.120]  i'm not a vatican agent i'm not a massade agent
[28:13.120 --> 28:16.160]  uh i'm not yeah a lot of this started when they found out there was a guy named
[28:16.160 --> 28:20.960]  alex s jones who's a new york times writer and runs the shorenstein center
[28:20.960 --> 28:25.520]  and they say i'm this 70 year old guy or there's a black guy named alex jones
[28:25.520 --> 28:28.160]  who's a catholic that's how all the catholic things started
[28:28.160 --> 28:32.160]  look alex here's your writings about the catholic church
[28:32.160 --> 28:35.760]  and so now i'm a secret vatican assassin because there's a black guy named alex
[28:35.760 --> 28:39.840]  jones and that's how this this whole schizophrenia
[28:39.840 --> 28:43.600]  begins and then it just becomes a reality
[28:43.600 --> 28:49.040]  um meanwhile everything's collapsing world government's coming in on us
[28:49.040 --> 28:52.640]  and i'm simply trying to wake people up i'm simply trying
[28:52.640 --> 28:56.480]  to reach out and and build up others and try to get a united front against the
[28:56.480 --> 29:01.440]  globalist but
[29:01.440 --> 29:08.960]  it's just just amazing just amazing to um
[29:08.960 --> 29:12.400]  have this type of stuff go on
[29:13.040 --> 29:17.840]  and to be accused everywhere of making zeitgeist of being anti christian it's
[29:17.840 --> 29:22.080]  just not true um and then to have peter joseph the
[29:22.080 --> 29:25.440]  maker of it come out in badmouth 911 truth and say he's moving away from 911
[29:25.440 --> 29:28.320]  truth now yeah because he got his audience with 911 truth now he can push
[29:28.320 --> 29:32.560]  his world government environmental utopia
[29:32.560 --> 29:36.240]  type stuff out of it all right the collapse of the auto industry the
[29:36.240 --> 29:40.080]  fed's taking control of it national compulsory service bill reintroduced
[29:40.080 --> 29:44.240]  with the compulsory service language webster tarbling in studio coming up

[34:16.720 --> 34:20.480]  the prisoners there um we got a host of issues to cover with
[34:20.480 --> 34:24.400]  webster tarbley who i want to thank he's a very intelligent classic guy an
[34:24.400 --> 34:29.920]  economist an author a historian uh and it's i appreciate him on short notice
[34:29.920 --> 34:33.520]  when i decided last week to make a second obama film for release july 4th
[34:33.520 --> 34:36.240]  we'll be telling you later in the week the name of the film the website
[34:36.240 --> 34:39.440]  and just no rest for us here we're going to launch another film obama
[34:39.440 --> 34:43.440]  deception has been more successful in two weeks than anything i've ever made
[34:43.440 --> 34:47.440]  uh just absolutely amazing so webster's been here in webster it's just i really
[34:47.440 --> 34:51.520]  count you as a friend and i really appreciate you being part of the film
[34:51.520 --> 34:54.480]  and being down here i know that you were going to be here about 10 this morning
[34:54.480 --> 34:56.880]  but you ended up being here late because you couldn't pull yourself away
[34:56.880 --> 35:01.520]  from obama and the television writing notes i was driving into work at 10 am
[35:01.520 --> 35:05.280]  listening to most of his press conference as he announced basically
[35:05.280 --> 35:09.920]  nothing for the autos we're going to teach you this is going to be painful
[35:09.920 --> 35:13.440]  in fact it was a painful concessions was a quote
[35:13.440 --> 35:16.960]  everything you said six eight months ago that he was going to do so we have
[35:16.960 --> 35:21.360]  almost 12 trillion for the bankers with their fiat
[35:21.360 --> 35:26.480]  derivatives but even loans to the automakers you can't have that
[35:26.480 --> 35:29.680]  they call this socialism but this isn't socialism
[35:29.680 --> 35:36.160]  socialism would be propping up the automakers and and and well i mean that
[35:36.160 --> 35:39.920]  would just be you know investment in the infrastructure really
[35:39.920 --> 35:42.960]  but instead it's just all going offshore to these banks is called you know hot
[35:42.960 --> 35:45.760]  money as webster calls it so webster you've got the floor
[35:45.760 --> 35:48.160]  break down what's happening with the auto industry
[35:48.160 --> 35:52.480]  right now in this incredible announcement that obama has made
[35:52.480 --> 35:56.400]  i think we've we've had a catastrophic defeat for the united states we've
[35:56.400 --> 36:00.720]  taken a giant step towards the collapse the economic collapse of this
[36:00.720 --> 36:05.360]  country with what obama has done welcome to the fascist corporate state
[36:05.360 --> 36:08.480]  that's what this is this is not socialism
[36:08.480 --> 36:12.480]  this is uh the corporate state now what obama says today
[36:12.480 --> 36:18.640]  is that uh he has no money nothing for uh general motors
[36:18.640 --> 36:22.880]  and christler now this is a government that has given
[36:22.880 --> 36:27.440]  about three billion dollars of bonuses for bank of america
[36:27.440 --> 36:31.440]  about three billion dollars of bonuses for merrill lynch now a part of bank of
[36:31.440 --> 36:36.320]  america we've got about 250 million of bonuses for
[36:36.320 --> 36:39.520]  aig out of bailout money out of bailout money
[36:39.520 --> 36:43.440]  so what what what christler and general motors need
[36:43.440 --> 36:47.920]  to survive for about a year is is uh there's a good part of it that has been
[36:47.920 --> 36:52.400]  given out as bonuses to these parasitical jackal hyenas
[36:52.400 --> 36:56.080]  that run uh wall street now i think this is catastrophic you can see that
[36:56.080 --> 37:00.960]  obama's aiming at two things he wants to destroy the automobile industry
[37:00.960 --> 37:05.760]  and he wants to destroy the ua w they want to destroy industrial unionism
[37:05.760 --> 37:10.160]  militant cio style trade unionism in the united states and they're going to put
[37:10.160 --> 37:12.960]  these companies through bankruptcy this is clear
[37:12.960 --> 37:16.560]  they're they're saying that they'll guarantee the warranty on the cars that
[37:16.560 --> 37:20.720]  have already been bought but this is heading for a massive downsizing
[37:20.720 --> 37:24.720]  and the busting of the union and i think this is uh well
[37:24.720 --> 37:28.240]  the the idea basically is if you don't have those factories in detroit if you
[37:28.240 --> 37:31.840]  don't have those production lines above all if you don't have that tool and die
[37:31.840 --> 37:35.440]  capability meaning machine tools you're on your
[37:35.440 --> 37:39.680]  way to a banana republic you're on a you're on your way to being a derelict
[37:39.680 --> 37:44.080]  hulk of ravaged wreck floating on the ocean of adventures
[37:44.080 --> 37:48.400]  at the mercy of every other country and let's be clear in the imf and world bank
[37:48.400 --> 37:51.120]  agreements that they've had with third world countries and first world nations
[37:51.120 --> 37:54.400]  that they've bankrupt by design they always tell them you've got to sell off
[37:54.400 --> 37:56.960]  your industry you've got to break it down because
[37:56.960 --> 38:01.760]  the banking economy the fiat economy the fraud economy the casino economy
[38:01.760 --> 38:06.000]  doesn't want competition in the real world because these magicians and their
[38:06.000 --> 38:09.920]  fiat currency openly want a post industrial society as billderberg
[38:09.920 --> 38:14.080]  group says and club of rome groups say because they want total
[38:14.080 --> 38:17.280]  control and once they have the nation fully deindustrialized
[38:17.280 --> 38:20.640]  then people will only be able to join the military only be able to join
[38:20.640 --> 38:25.280]  government service and will be a giant governmental run third world banana
[38:25.280 --> 38:28.320]  republic as you've just said so this plan is clearly
[38:28.320 --> 38:32.240]  coming into view break down what he said in the speech it would you say fiat
[38:32.240 --> 38:35.600]  right it's going to be fiat chrysler so we're getting a new dimension of fiat
[38:35.600 --> 38:40.000]  money chrysler is going to run on fiat money from fiat and tour in
[38:40.000 --> 38:44.480]  uh we're headed towards a post industrial junkyard a post industrial
[38:44.480 --> 38:48.960]  rubble field a moonscape a cratered landscape with wrecked
[38:48.960 --> 38:55.200]  factories uh obama basically says that the plans submitted by
[38:55.200 --> 38:58.800]  chrysler and and general motors are inadequate
[38:58.800 --> 39:02.640]  and actually what obama is looking at is the gangrene economy obama believes
[39:02.640 --> 39:06.080]  that everything should be green everything should be low energy
[39:06.080 --> 39:08.960]  intensity and so forth he wants them to build green cars
[39:08.960 --> 39:13.360]  this is absolutely crazy stuff because this is can't be done and they all
[39:13.360 --> 39:16.560]  agree that in order to have green cars manufactured
[39:16.560 --> 39:20.080]  you've got to bust the union take away the health care from the retirees and
[39:20.080 --> 39:23.920]  the current workers drive down the hourly wage and transform
[39:23.920 --> 39:28.720]  detroit from what it was which was a high wage economy right goes back
[39:28.720 --> 39:32.240]  henry ford even henry ford realized you've got to pay the auto worker
[39:32.240 --> 39:36.160]  enough so that he can buy the cars that he's that he's actually producing
[39:36.160 --> 39:39.440]  but now they say no we're going to drive them down to the sweatshop level
[39:39.440 --> 39:42.160]  yeah they don't want a growing economy and a segue because in all our
[39:42.160 --> 39:44.480]  interviews we've done in the last two days we haven't gotten into this and
[39:44.480 --> 39:50.400]  we'll go back into the cars um just like two weeks ago i had the head of the
[39:50.400 --> 39:53.280]  american legion on and he and it was in the associated
[39:53.280 --> 39:57.120]  press he went to meet with obama and obama said the rumors you've heard are
[39:57.120 --> 40:00.400]  true i want to make injured veterans not just
[40:00.400 --> 40:05.280]  regular veterans but but uh amputees people have catastrophic loss i want
[40:05.280 --> 40:08.480]  them to have to get their own insurance and pay
[40:08.480 --> 40:11.840]  for their own medical care so they're not just talking about taking
[40:11.840 --> 40:15.440]  the auto workers pensions away or health care away right
[40:15.440 --> 40:19.120]  that they've signed contracts and paid money into to to fund
[40:19.120 --> 40:22.080]  they're now talking about taking away from the troops can you talk about
[40:22.080 --> 40:25.280]  taking the health care away from veterans well they basically want to
[40:25.280 --> 40:29.120]  drive down the standard of living that when obama says health care reform he's
[40:29.120 --> 40:32.000]  referring to a process of rationing of care
[40:32.000 --> 40:35.440]  under the cover of maybe extending coverage to people who don't have it to
[40:35.440 --> 40:40.880]  essentially lop off the top of the coverage area so that the expensive
[40:40.880 --> 40:44.480]  operations will not have an aspirin instead of a surgery but yeah you'll
[40:44.480 --> 40:47.280]  be given bandaids for cancer specifically because we're making a film
[40:47.280 --> 40:48.880]  right now so this will also be in the film
[40:48.880 --> 40:53.120]  specifically can you speak to that move just the arrogance of a quote only left
[40:53.120 --> 40:57.040]  cover could do this oh i'm the liberal i'm gonna give you socialism
[40:57.040 --> 41:01.280]  it's not socialism to to take the health care away from the troops and make them
[41:01.280 --> 41:04.320]  pay for it themselves with insurance specifically speak to that
[41:04.320 --> 41:09.040]  well the uh... the idea is that we have this book by dashel where he says that
[41:09.040 --> 41:12.080]  if you have an affliction you better learn to live with your affliction
[41:12.080 --> 41:14.960]  this is the guy that obama wanted to have is the great reformer of health and
[41:14.960 --> 41:17.600]  human services until he was knocked out by
[41:17.600 --> 41:20.640]  the fact that he was a tax cheat he didn't pay a hundred and fifty thousand
[41:20.640 --> 41:24.480]  dollars of of taxes most people would be in jail dashel so far
[41:24.480 --> 41:28.080]  is not in jail dashel of course is a creature of city bank city bank the
[41:28.080 --> 41:31.440]  biggest employer in south dakota which sponsored his
[41:31.440 --> 41:34.800]  political career so this was the guy that obama was going to bring in
[41:34.800 --> 41:38.560]  and give command over the wrecking of the health care system
[41:38.560 --> 41:42.080]  uh... again with this left cover that i'll extend some kind of
[41:42.080 --> 41:45.840]  bandaids and aspirin coverage to people who don't have anything but
[41:45.840 --> 41:49.200]  in terms of the expensive technologies those will be rationed
[41:49.200 --> 41:52.960]  and people will be expected to die again if you're over sixty five
[41:52.960 --> 41:56.880]  you're probably gonna be a candidate to die if you are overweight if you smoke
[41:56.880 --> 42:00.720]  if you have any of these other things that uh... mark you as a as a high risk
[42:00.720 --> 42:04.800]  subject then they'd say a cost-benefit benefit analysis makes you a
[42:04.800 --> 42:07.680]  useless eater and your responsibility is to
[42:07.680 --> 42:11.200]  suppress yourself for the bottom line of the of the system
[42:11.200 --> 42:14.400]  private insurance companies that are piling in to take on
[42:14.400 --> 42:17.280]  parts of this stuff but but specifically speak to the troops in that
[42:17.280 --> 42:20.480]  proposal is wrong it shouldn't be done specifically yourself as we're taping
[42:20.480 --> 42:21.120]  for the film
[42:21.120 --> 42:24.800]  kick coming can you speak in your own words even trying that with the troops
[42:24.800 --> 42:28.880]  yeah it's crazy this is what bush did right bush was with bush was chiseling
[42:28.880 --> 42:32.400]  away and gouging away at veterans benefits and stuff like this right the
[42:32.400 --> 42:36.400]  v a hospital system and so forth was massively underfunded under bush
[42:36.400 --> 42:39.280]  and bush of course was rightly excoriated right people said you know
[42:39.280 --> 42:43.360]  you're you're an irresponsible criminal now obama does it
[42:43.360 --> 42:47.120]  and either they don't notice or they say well you know he and that he inherited
[42:47.120 --> 42:48.000]  this terrible
[42:48.000 --> 42:51.760]  situation so with left cover isn't an amazing what you can do
[42:51.760 --> 42:55.440]  when you have a cheering section of left liberal kool-aid drinkers and
[42:55.440 --> 42:58.640]  and and loons look what you can get away with
[42:58.640 --> 43:02.800]  and that's a obama i think obama is the greatest con artist of modern times
[43:02.800 --> 43:06.480]  uh... especially what he did today right he looks at the camera and he says
[43:06.480 --> 43:10.960]  i will fight for you i will fight for you i'm trying to find some way to save
[43:10.960 --> 43:14.400]  your industry i have a way treat them like they're a i g
[43:14.400 --> 43:18.080]  throw twenty or thirty billion at them like you throw it at a i g
[43:18.080 --> 43:20.960]  we had geithner a week ago coming forward saying
[43:20.960 --> 43:24.640]  i want a hundred billion now for derivatives for toxic
[43:24.640 --> 43:29.680]  derivatives that are have negative value and and he said up to a trillion
[43:29.680 --> 43:34.240]  so there's up to a trillion more on top of the top so one point seven trillion
[43:34.240 --> 43:37.440]  of treasury money in addition to the eight nine trillion
[43:37.440 --> 43:41.360]  of federal reserve lending any of the banks but nothing we can't get twenty
[43:41.360 --> 43:44.480]  billion thirty billion for forward and uh... for closer general motors and
[43:44.480 --> 43:47.680]  four will say that again as we're taking the film but i want to be clear here
[43:47.680 --> 43:51.760]  uh... they're now called calling for seven hundred and fifty billion admitting
[43:51.760 --> 43:56.480]  that the green taxes uh... are to be paid
[43:56.480 --> 43:59.600]  into the banks so that's another seven hundred fifty billion
[43:59.600 --> 44:02.480]  uh... the i'm at world bankers saying they want
[44:02.480 --> 44:06.640]  five hundred billion this week at the g twenty show explain explain that we're
[44:06.640 --> 44:09.040]  talking thirty to fifty to one
[44:09.040 --> 44:12.240]  yeah i think that's the the general profile of obama is
[44:12.240 --> 44:17.520]  it's about ten trillion eleven trillion maybe it maybe twelve trillion by now
[44:17.520 --> 44:22.000]  for the banks only for the banks for banks stock brokerages
[44:22.000 --> 44:25.360]  credit card companies money markets mutual funds
[44:25.360 --> 44:29.040]  basically meaning all derivatives derivatives bandits of all
[44:29.040 --> 44:33.440]  all stripes and then compared to that the the useful spending
[44:33.440 --> 44:37.600]  in the stimulus package is about three hundred billion maybe three hundred and
[44:37.600 --> 44:41.680]  fifty billion so call it thirty to one but we may be closer to forty one
[44:41.680 --> 44:45.360]  forty to one we may be getting up to fifty to one so i'm for every dollar
[44:45.360 --> 44:48.800]  that the american people and production receive
[44:48.800 --> 44:52.560]  we got about forty to fifty dollars for the banking community so
[44:52.560 --> 44:57.360]  that's uh... that's not socialism that's uh... the corporate state of the musolini
[44:57.360 --> 45:00.320]  variety okay take your time start over
[45:00.320 --> 45:04.400]  get into what's really happening what his incredible announcements mean
[45:04.400 --> 45:06.560]  where he says look i know it's already been painful
[45:06.560 --> 45:09.200]  uh... but quote it's going to be even more painful
[45:09.200 --> 45:13.120]  concessions but i'm going to help you i'm going to help you
[45:13.120 --> 45:16.560]  by taking you from twenty five dollars an hour to twelve dollars an hour and
[45:16.560 --> 45:19.280]  robbing the benefits you've been paying in for
[45:19.280 --> 45:22.880]  so this is pension fund robbing you know bush changed the rules
[45:22.880 --> 45:27.200]  six years ago so they can do this they're now moving to do it
[45:27.200 --> 45:30.640]  the auto industry today for christ general motors represents about a
[45:30.640 --> 45:33.840]  century of american history think about all the generations of working
[45:33.840 --> 45:37.360]  families ua w families that have contributed to that think about the
[45:37.360 --> 45:40.400]  great labor battles of the nineteen thirties right
[45:40.400 --> 45:43.520]  the sit-down strikes with walter roother in the ua w
[45:43.520 --> 45:47.440]  think about the tolito auto light strike think about the time that henry ford
[45:47.440 --> 45:52.160]  got the mayor of flint to set up machine guns on an overpass so that a march of
[45:52.160 --> 45:55.840]  workers couldn't get close to the four plants and that actually opened fire
[45:55.840 --> 46:00.480]  machine gunning american workers so this union had to be built
[46:00.480 --> 46:03.600]  uh... on these struggles and that's something that all of us
[46:03.600 --> 46:06.800]  have a stake in then on the other side of course the technology
[46:06.800 --> 46:10.400]  uh... this is where the other the uh... the b-seventeen's were built the tanks
[46:10.400 --> 46:14.080]  were built in world war two these are the factories that stop fascism
[46:14.080 --> 46:17.040]  around the world right built all the stuff that the soviet's used during
[46:17.040 --> 46:18.080]  world war two
[46:18.080 --> 46:22.320]  underlandly so all of that is now going to be destroyed now
[46:22.320 --> 46:27.440]  you're approaching something i think important the moment of thermodynamic
[46:27.440 --> 46:30.960]  collapse of the united states so-called heat death
[46:30.960 --> 46:34.720]  of this economy you reach your point and we've kind of had a brush with it in
[46:34.720 --> 46:38.480]  the last couple of days right suppose everything begins to fail at once
[46:38.480 --> 46:42.560]  suppose the trains don't run the trains come to a halt the subways come to a
[46:42.560 --> 46:46.560]  halt the airplanes have all got mechanical defects they don't fly
[46:46.560 --> 46:51.600]  the electric grid goes down the system of of food distribution begins to
[46:51.600 --> 46:56.240]  collapse and everything implodes uh... the only way you get out of that is by
[46:56.240 --> 46:59.760]  having industrial capabilities now what obama has done today
[46:59.760 --> 47:04.560]  by saying no money for general motors no money for christler
[47:04.560 --> 47:08.880]  uh... essentially the christler now has thirty days to live
[47:08.880 --> 47:12.160]  uh... this is absolutely crazy so we're approaching the point
[47:12.160 --> 47:15.200]  of thermodynamic collapse now let me just say something we've got to focus
[47:15.200 --> 47:18.000]  also not only what they do what do we want to do
[47:18.000 --> 47:22.320]  my program for the auto industry goes like this nationalize them protect them
[47:22.320 --> 47:25.440]  from the hyena creditors especially christler
[47:25.440 --> 47:30.080]  christler is owned by a hedge fund serberus fund rip it out of their hands
[47:30.080 --> 47:34.400]  nationalize it uh... then at that point kick out the current management
[47:34.400 --> 47:37.600]  and put in industrial engineers who would be competent
[47:37.600 --> 47:42.080]  managers of production you've got to wipe out derivatives wherever they exist
[47:42.080 --> 47:45.200]  right general motors acceptance corporation is full of derivatives
[47:45.200 --> 47:48.640]  wipe that out that's part of your general campaign to wipe out derivatives
[47:48.640 --> 47:51.600]  wherever they're found and then we convert those plants
[47:51.600 --> 47:55.680]  not to build gangrene cars right not to build these these crazy things with
[47:55.680 --> 47:59.200]  batteries that go 30 miles at the you know 20 miles an hour
[47:59.200 --> 48:03.680]  you could build nuclear plants you can build tractors for the third world
[48:03.680 --> 48:07.040]  you can build maglev railway you can build rolling stock for
[48:07.040 --> 48:11.680]  for modern railroads and you can build equipment for a space program if you're
[48:11.680 --> 48:15.120]  talking about exploration colonization and industrial production
[48:15.120 --> 48:19.280]  on the moon mars and other nearby objects and you see people don't understand
[48:19.280 --> 48:22.240]  that people understand that either humans are upwardly mobile
[48:22.240 --> 48:26.560]  we're either innovating or we're collapsing and and this is understood
[48:26.560 --> 48:29.520]  by the establishment when we come back i want you to go through
[48:29.520 --> 48:32.960]  like you did in that taping we did yesterday the four different systems
[48:32.960 --> 48:38.240]  of uh... you know getting a lot about yes let's go through that because
[48:38.240 --> 48:42.080]  because you know there's this schizophrenia and this mental gymnastics
[48:42.080 --> 48:45.840]  this fraud that goes on out there i'm against big government
[48:45.840 --> 48:48.640]  let me explain something i'm against big government
[48:48.640 --> 48:53.200]  financing to carry out eugenics and tell black women they can't have their man
[48:53.200 --> 48:56.800]  in the house to get money so that they can break down their families and have
[48:56.800 --> 48:59.760]  90 percent legitimacy which is a government plan
[48:59.760 --> 49:03.760]  but i am uh... for if you're going to have government don't think it should be
[49:03.760 --> 49:06.320]  doing is building giant industrial bases
[49:06.320 --> 49:09.440]  railways you know i had family that works in the railroad system
[49:09.440 --> 49:13.280]  we haven't had the railways fixed in a hundred years we have worse than third
[49:13.280 --> 49:17.120]  world countries everything is rotting and so
[49:17.120 --> 49:20.400]  when you build roads when you build an issue when you build factories
[49:20.400 --> 49:24.880]  it then creates wealth for the people to then spend at your car dealership to
[49:24.880 --> 49:28.400]  spend at your mexican food restaurant to spend at your clothe or
[49:28.400 --> 49:33.120]  i mean this is how real economies work instead of this post industrial society
[49:33.120 --> 49:37.440]  where where we do have fascism all the money goes to private banks
[49:37.440 --> 49:40.720]  then they use it to buy up industry and turn it off
[49:40.720 --> 49:44.800]  because they want a total feudal dictatorship to control populations
[49:44.800 --> 49:48.320]  this is malthusian eugenic you agree it's in their own documents you're a scholar
[49:48.320 --> 49:50.880]  i research we come to the same conclusion so
[49:50.880 --> 49:53.840]  i want to i want to go through the von mis people and all of them and i say
[49:53.840 --> 49:59.920]  that's preferable to the big state with the you know evil eugenicist in control
[49:59.920 --> 50:03.680]  but then what's preferable to that even more is
[50:03.680 --> 50:07.520]  is i think kind of a hybrid uh... with with what we call the free market what
[50:07.520 --> 50:09.440]  you're doing because there is no such thing
[50:09.440 --> 50:15.040]  here's these phony conservatives saying we cannot give money to ford and gm
[50:15.040 --> 50:18.080]  we cannot give money to chrysler this is socialism
[50:18.080 --> 50:22.000]  but then meanwhile they support trillions of dollars
[50:22.000 --> 50:26.320]  to foreign offshore banks with made up derivative crap they just pulled out of
[50:26.320 --> 50:29.600]  the air with uh... it's not even a ponzi scheme it's it's a
[50:29.600 --> 50:33.920]  illusion like a magician and so the issue here is
[50:33.920 --> 50:36.960]  you have the false fiat economy the banking economy
[50:36.960 --> 50:40.320]  that's now forty percent of the world when it should be about one percent of
[50:40.320 --> 50:44.080]  the world sucking like a black hole the whole real economy into it
[50:44.080 --> 50:46.720]  and and and and and so if we're going to have
[50:46.720 --> 50:50.160]  imagine twelve trillion invested in infrastructure instantly
[50:50.160 --> 50:54.160]  the economy would explode there'd be bulging money in all of our pockets
[50:54.160 --> 50:57.840]  there'd be a real economy so we're going to go over that versus what obama is
[50:57.840 --> 51:00.640]  doing when we get back
[51:00.640 --> 51:04.080]  alex jones here with a question what does humidity mean to you
[51:04.080 --> 51:08.080]  most people think of hot and sticky summer days but many people are beginning

[54:47.120 --> 54:51.440]  fort and gm calling us socialist if we're for that this is the height of
[54:51.440 --> 54:55.840]  arrogance but your take on the obama deception i think it's a masterpiece i
[54:55.840 --> 54:59.280]  congratulate you in your team for putting it together it's uh... it's extremely
[54:59.280 --> 55:01.440]  powerful it's extremely timely
[55:01.440 --> 55:05.120]  it's the best political documentary to come out of the united states in
[55:05.120 --> 55:10.160]  years or decades and i think it's going to have a tremendous effect in uh...
[55:10.160 --> 55:14.000]  opening people's eyes mainly the idea that the uh...
[55:14.000 --> 55:17.440]  the obama people are trying to set up this this fake
[55:17.440 --> 55:21.360]  charade right that you can choose between obama on the one hand and rush
[55:21.360 --> 55:24.080]  limbaugh and these reactionaries
[55:24.080 --> 55:26.640]  in union busters and what have you on the other
[55:26.640 --> 55:30.880]  uh... that's no choice my response to obama and limbaugh is to say
[55:30.880 --> 55:34.160]  a plague on both your houses that's a hobson's choice that's where you're
[55:34.160 --> 55:37.600]  damned if you do damned if you don't what this documentary does is to show
[55:37.600 --> 55:41.200]  there's a there's another way out of this another way to look at it and above
[55:41.200 --> 55:44.640]  all to strip obama of left cover
[55:44.640 --> 55:48.320]  uh... he is an agent of wall street you can see it today
[55:48.320 --> 55:51.920]  he's carrying out a policy that's made up by summers geithner
[55:51.920 --> 55:54.960]  and indeed by paul adolf valker and one of the people who
[55:54.960 --> 55:59.040]  did the most to create this collapse of the auto industry is valker with a 22
[55:59.040 --> 56:03.040]  percent prime rate going back thirty years ago and we're gonna go over all
[56:03.040 --> 56:06.080]  that in the next hour until forty five after now some extra time for you to
[56:06.080 --> 56:09.920]  catch your plane uh... but what's your before we do that specifically having
[56:09.920 --> 56:13.520]  private discussions about this here they are
[56:13.520 --> 56:17.440]  uh... now approaching a bailout bigger than the entire gdp
[56:17.440 --> 56:20.880]  of the united states or close to a third of the world gdp
[56:20.880 --> 56:25.520]  in less than six months and limbaugh and obama are both
[56:25.520 --> 56:30.640]  four trillions to the banks they divert us with the billions in in bonuses
[56:30.640 --> 56:33.680]  limbaugh says he's for that but what about the private shareholders who are
[56:33.680 --> 56:37.200]  really getting the lion's share of the trillions not just the billions and
[56:37.200 --> 56:38.400]  then they say but
[56:38.400 --> 56:39.880]  you're a socialist
[56:39.880 --> 56:41.880]  if you want to help these evil corrupt
[56:41.880 --> 56:45.840]  uh... auto companies and then there's endless discussions it's a fad to bash
[56:45.840 --> 56:46.960]  the auto companies
[56:46.960 --> 56:48.200]  they're certainly not perfect
[56:48.200 --> 56:50.440]  you know on the news in the culture
[56:50.440 --> 56:53.920]  that i don't think i was perfect a wagon or was forced out last night and i
[56:53.920 --> 56:56.640]  think wagon or was forced out because he was somebody who grew up in general
[56:56.640 --> 56:58.320]  motors and he might have fought
[56:58.320 --> 56:59.360]  to defend
[56:59.360 --> 57:02.560]  the idea of having an industrial economy right of having jobs
[57:02.560 --> 57:03.480]  so uh...
[57:03.480 --> 57:04.960]  let's look at it again
[57:04.960 --> 57:06.760]  a i g
[57:06.760 --> 57:08.880]  a hundred and sixty billion
[57:08.880 --> 57:11.160]  from the u.s. government a i g
[57:11.160 --> 57:16.480]  to bail out one hedge fund in london they created three trillion of derivatives
[57:16.480 --> 57:18.520]  they're a i g financial products now
[57:18.520 --> 57:20.000]  who got that money
[57:20.000 --> 57:22.640]  about ten to twelve billion
[57:22.640 --> 57:24.400]  to dot your bank of germany
[57:24.400 --> 57:26.400]  so she did a general of france
[57:26.400 --> 57:28.040]  and barclays bank of britain
[57:28.040 --> 57:30.840]  so that's about thirty five billion
[57:30.840 --> 57:33.520]  for bankers in foreign countries
[57:33.520 --> 57:36.320]  and that's the money if you had that thirty five billion you could easily save
[57:36.320 --> 57:37.080]  detroit
[57:37.080 --> 57:38.240]  for a couple of years
[57:38.240 --> 57:39.480]  and generally speaking
[57:39.480 --> 57:42.560]  uh... ten trillion for the banks compares to
[57:42.560 --> 57:45.260]  twenty billion for food stamps
[57:45.260 --> 57:48.280]  so you can get a hundred and fifteen dollars a month of food stamps
[57:48.280 --> 57:49.400]  if you're unemployed
[57:49.400 --> 57:52.120]  you're an individual or family getting two hundred and fifty
[57:52.120 --> 57:56.160]  dollars a month in food stamps obama's going to raise that by about ten percent
[57:56.160 --> 58:00.120]  forty billion goes to prolonging unemployment benefits so you get a few
[58:00.120 --> 58:01.120]  more weeks
[58:01.120 --> 58:02.160]  on the dull
[58:02.160 --> 58:03.480]  and at the same time
[58:03.480 --> 58:05.020]  the trillions are flowing
[58:05.020 --> 58:08.600]  and above all a lot of the recipients are in foreign countries
[58:08.600 --> 58:13.160]  if barclays dot your bank and so see to general is so important how come
[58:13.160 --> 58:15.700]  mcgordon-brown
[58:15.700 --> 58:17.280]  and madame merkel
[58:17.280 --> 58:20.880]  don't save them and bail them out themselves this is absolutely crazy

[1:00:20.760 --> 1:00:22.200]  alex jones
[1:00:22.200 --> 1:00:26.240]  let's get rid of entirely is our guest in studio for the forty five minutes
[1:00:26.240 --> 1:00:30.040]  from the uh... shandy towns being converted to fema camps in california
[1:00:30.040 --> 1:00:32.520]  but two of our reporters on scene
[1:00:32.520 --> 1:00:35.440]  rob do and jason douglas
[1:00:35.440 --> 1:00:38.160]  okay well so we were ranting during that one-minute break
[1:00:38.160 --> 1:00:39.320]  uh...
[1:00:39.320 --> 1:00:43.840]  i mean just in summation i don't need to break it down in your own words
[1:00:43.840 --> 1:00:47.120]  well you go ahead we were just talking about it it's it is a little bit
[1:00:47.120 --> 1:00:48.600]  incredible double standard
[1:00:48.600 --> 1:00:51.680]  it's it's absolute hypocrisy absolute double standard
[1:00:51.680 --> 1:00:54.680]  obama's the greatest con artist of our time
[1:00:54.680 --> 1:00:57.000]  he says to the auto industry
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:01:01.680]  you guys have to prove viability you have to show me a model that gets you
[1:01:01.680 --> 1:01:03.880]  profitable they submit a plan and he says
[1:01:03.880 --> 1:01:05.580]  this is not good enough
[1:01:05.580 --> 1:01:09.280]  i'm giving you thirty more days around giving a little bit more time now
[1:01:09.280 --> 1:01:14.560]  notice what happens when city bank needs twenty billion they get it right away
[1:01:14.560 --> 1:01:16.320]  they don't have to prove anything
[1:01:16.320 --> 1:01:19.880]  they don't have to tell where the money is going they don't have to say how many
[1:01:19.880 --> 1:01:21.840]  how many billions go for bonuses
[1:01:21.840 --> 1:01:24.280]  they don't have to say how much of it goes to do by
[1:01:24.280 --> 1:01:26.320]  or other foreign countries
[1:01:26.320 --> 1:01:29.440]  uh... the the the duplicity of obama
[1:01:29.440 --> 1:01:32.680]  couldn't be more evident we had last week i think they're coming forward with
[1:01:32.680 --> 1:01:33.840]  another
[1:01:33.840 --> 1:01:37.160]  hundred billion followed by really another trillion
[1:01:37.160 --> 1:01:41.240]  for derivatives only and now we're being told that the automobile industry has
[1:01:41.240 --> 1:01:42.600]  not gone far enough
[1:01:42.600 --> 1:01:46.600]  towards proving its viability and then these moments remember and the sharks
[1:01:46.600 --> 1:01:48.560]  are coming in saying
[1:01:48.560 --> 1:01:51.800]  we're gonna make you break down we're gonna take your pension funds
[1:01:51.800 --> 1:01:55.200]  we're gonna make you be sold out to foreigners you know the the uh... scrap
[1:01:55.200 --> 1:01:56.240]  the husk
[1:01:56.240 --> 1:01:58.880]  and then meanwhile was talking about this in your own words
[1:01:58.880 --> 1:02:02.800]  then the banks flush with all this money they won't even money given to them
[1:02:02.800 --> 1:02:04.240]  they won't even loan it
[1:02:04.240 --> 1:02:05.720]  to the auto industry yet
[1:02:05.720 --> 1:02:09.440]  see the whole point of the tarp right the uh... the bailout of our class
[1:02:09.440 --> 1:02:10.320]  october
[1:02:10.320 --> 1:02:12.800]  the original seven hundred billion we were told
[1:02:12.800 --> 1:02:16.420]  you've gotta have a viable banking system to provide credit
[1:02:16.420 --> 1:02:18.040]  for the economy well
[1:02:18.040 --> 1:02:21.520]  seven hundred billion has been put in and i think there is now promising up to
[1:02:21.520 --> 1:02:22.820]  another trillion more
[1:02:22.820 --> 1:02:25.720]  so that's almost two trillion dollars now i want to know
[1:02:25.720 --> 1:02:30.200]  we're told the christlin general motors need financing where is jp morgan
[1:02:30.200 --> 1:02:31.020]  chase
[1:02:31.020 --> 1:02:33.760]  they got twenty five billion out of the top
[1:02:33.760 --> 1:02:38.280]  where is city bank they've been refinanced twice and counting
[1:02:38.280 --> 1:02:41.840]  uh... at least forty billion has gone into city bank how come they're not
[1:02:41.840 --> 1:02:46.520]  lending to to for the christlin in gm how about bank of america
[1:02:46.520 --> 1:02:50.480]  the zombie banks are taking the money from the public till
[1:02:50.480 --> 1:02:51.960]  and they're not lending it
[1:02:51.960 --> 1:02:55.520]  i would also add these these things like circuit city right six hundred stores
[1:02:55.520 --> 1:02:58.340]  thirty five thousand jobs where were those banks
[1:02:58.340 --> 1:03:02.440]  that are cashing in on the tarp gravy train right that the big bailout money
[1:03:02.440 --> 1:03:05.780]  they're not lending why are we supporting these banks
[1:03:05.780 --> 1:03:08.600]  the whole idea of this process think about it at the beginning
[1:03:08.600 --> 1:03:12.200]  we were told this is not a bailout of wall street this is a bailout of main
[1:03:12.200 --> 1:03:15.960]  street we want to make that money available to mainstream well detroit is
[1:03:15.960 --> 1:03:18.400]  main street detroit is everybody's main street
[1:03:18.400 --> 1:03:22.040]  the midwest industrial economy around the great lakes is the heart of this
[1:03:22.040 --> 1:03:26.880]  country you rip that out this country goes into thermodynamic collapse living
[1:03:26.880 --> 1:03:31.040]  standards will collapse the level of uh... morbidity and mortality in the
[1:03:31.040 --> 1:03:34.960]  population will skyrocket in other words millions of people will be on their
[1:03:34.960 --> 1:03:38.240]  way towards much earlier deaths than they would have had otherwise talk about
[1:03:38.240 --> 1:03:42.240]  limbo come on and i mean specifically he says give trillions of the bank
[1:03:42.240 --> 1:03:45.840]  so that's good and they don't have to tell the congress where the money went
[1:03:45.840 --> 1:03:49.680]  bernack you won't say where it goes but then meanwhile loans
[1:03:49.680 --> 1:03:53.800]  to gm loans the chrysler that is socialist absolutely
[1:03:53.800 --> 1:03:57.320]  see limbaugh limbaugh's record is the following limbaugh says
[1:03:57.320 --> 1:04:02.280]  i'm gonna focus on the twenty billion for food stamps i'm gonna focus on
[1:04:02.280 --> 1:04:06.840]  fifty billion for aid uh... to people with uh... facing foreclosure
[1:04:06.840 --> 1:04:11.320]  he doesn't care about the ten trillion that went to the banks he's not really
[1:04:11.320 --> 1:04:14.240]  uh... you know he's not in an uproar about that
[1:04:14.240 --> 1:04:17.800]  he's got a he's got a class conscious standard in other words he represents
[1:04:17.800 --> 1:04:22.000]  wall street he's somebody who was obviously promoted by william f buckley
[1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:25.080]  somebody who was introduced to henry kissinger at an early age he was brought
[1:04:25.080 --> 1:04:28.280]  in with the help of uh... roger ailes and others
[1:04:28.280 --> 1:04:32.800]  uh... so he's basically telling you that the problem with obama is that obama is
[1:04:32.800 --> 1:04:37.240]  taking your money and giving it to the dead beats and the losers and the
[1:04:37.240 --> 1:04:41.760]  underachievers and he talks about the achievers the achieving class
[1:04:41.760 --> 1:04:44.840]  of course the bankers in limbaugh's words he had a woman call him up the other
[1:04:44.840 --> 1:04:47.120]  day so that we got a break come back and tell the story
[1:04:47.120 --> 1:04:49.560]  this is very important we'll break down with
[1:04:49.560 --> 1:04:54.000]  the good plan to fix things versus what their plan is will profile both of those
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:58.400]  webster griffin tarpley as we watch the world slide into deep depression and
[1:04:58.400 --> 1:05:01.560]  the bankers couldn't be happier

[1:06:04.280 --> 1:06:09.360]  barack obama is the tip of the spear we've got to have a civilian national

[1:08:07.800 --> 1:08:15.160]  continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network okay Webster Tarbley in
[1:08:15.160 --> 1:08:21.680]  studio a lot of key info to cover finish up with how Obama and limbaugh they're
[1:08:21.680 --> 1:08:26.000]  really on the same team they just create the illusion of choice and that a fight
[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:30.240]  is going on Obama props up limbaugh with a phony right wing limbaugh as white
[1:08:30.240 --> 1:08:34.080]  house memo says props up Obama with his supporters because they say well we hate
[1:08:34.080 --> 1:08:38.600]  Obama then then then you know limbaugh saying he's helping the poor when
[1:08:38.600 --> 1:08:42.720]  reality he isn't he's imploding the economy going into shock therapy so this
[1:08:42.720 --> 1:08:48.080]  is how this mind game works break it down well Obama is not the new Roosevelt
[1:08:48.080 --> 1:08:53.400]  he's the new Carter he's not the new new deal he's the new malaise except that
[1:08:53.400 --> 1:08:57.560]  the handlers of Obama the Brzezinski's and valkers and so forth have learned
[1:08:57.560 --> 1:09:01.960]  from Carter that you can't just go with austerity sacrifice blood sweat and
[1:09:01.960 --> 1:09:05.840]  tears malaise and all this stuff you've got to have some window dressing up front
[1:09:05.840 --> 1:09:10.880]  so Obama also to placate various Democrats in the House and Congress in
[1:09:10.880 --> 1:09:16.560]  general Obama has put some pieces some crumbs some chum rights have been
[1:09:16.560 --> 1:09:22.960]  thrown up front by the 20 billion for food stamps 40 billion for unemployment
[1:09:22.960 --> 1:09:28.800]  benefits maybe 50 to 60 billion for infrastructure now the US infrastructure
[1:09:28.800 --> 1:09:34.800]  deficit is maybe 5 trillion 7 trillion 8 trillion instead we get 50 to 60 billion
[1:09:34.800 --> 1:09:39.800]  of infrastructure from from Obama so this is basically camouflage and window
[1:09:39.800 --> 1:09:44.560]  dressing but notice what a what limbaugh does limbaugh attacks the cape not the
[1:09:44.560 --> 1:09:51.000]  matador limbaugh attacks the the these penny anti-camouflage things that are
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  set up there in the in the in the foreground and he ignores the fact that
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:59.680]  you have all of this money going to the bank so this is a charade in other words
[1:09:59.680 --> 1:10:05.200]  this is a dog and pony show that's now being set up limbaugh says Obama's a
[1:10:05.200 --> 1:10:10.040]  socialist and he's actually helping Obama every time the old with limbaugh
[1:10:10.040 --> 1:10:13.960]  attacks Obama as a socialist or somebody who's helping the deadbeats helping the
[1:10:13.960 --> 1:10:18.200]  poor helping the losers that helps Obama because the large number of people
[1:10:18.200 --> 1:10:21.920]  say well you know under under limbaugh we'd be left with nothing but our eyes
[1:10:21.920 --> 1:10:26.200]  to cry with so there's a terrible terrible situation now you asked before
[1:10:26.200 --> 1:10:30.120]  them what can you do in this situation right how do you get out of a depression
[1:10:30.120 --> 1:10:35.120]  there really there are four possibilities that have been tried right one is what
[1:10:35.120 --> 1:10:40.120]  the republicans say they say deflation they say let me stop you go back to the
[1:10:40.120 --> 1:10:43.400]  economic theory when this was developed these four systems okay well this this
[1:10:43.400 --> 1:10:47.640]  is a speech by this guy Lautenbach to the Friedrich List society in Berlin in
[1:10:47.640 --> 1:10:53.160]  September of 1931 so Germany is sliding rapidly into depression the British have
[1:10:53.160 --> 1:10:58.320]  just defaulted on gold September 1931 the world depression is getting really
[1:10:58.320 --> 1:11:02.840]  deep and and they're looking at the threat of Hitler so these guys in the
[1:11:02.840 --> 1:11:07.000]  in the German central banks said well what should we do and Lautenbach gave
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:13.040]  the speech to this famous meeting we said look one way would be deflation cut
[1:11:13.040 --> 1:11:17.480]  the budget cut public expenditure try to balance the budget let everybody go
[1:11:17.480 --> 1:11:22.240]  bankrupt this is essentially what Andrew Mellon was talking about I think I
[1:11:22.240 --> 1:11:26.960]  who ran Harding Coolidge in Hoover when Andrew Mellon said liquidate stocks
[1:11:26.960 --> 1:11:31.640]  liquidate bonds liquidate real estate liquidate labor too bad if you die right
[1:11:31.640 --> 1:11:36.160]  or Schumpeter says creative destruction well if you get destroyed you're not
[1:11:36.160 --> 1:11:39.760]  going to feel very creative so that obviously says Lautenbach that's no
[1:11:39.760 --> 1:11:43.880]  good what's the other one well there's the Keynesian one what later became the
[1:11:43.880 --> 1:11:49.280]  Keynesian one which is have a consumer led recovery give people money let them
[1:11:49.280 --> 1:11:55.160]  go out and buy refrigerators and shoes and and electronics and so forth the
[1:11:55.160 --> 1:11:58.840]  problem of that is once you've done it you've done it once you have the same
[1:11:58.840 --> 1:12:02.960]  problem next year in other words it might give you a very mild immediate lift
[1:12:02.960 --> 1:12:06.600]  but it doesn't solve anything durable and it leads into inflation leads into
[1:12:06.600 --> 1:12:11.280]  inflation and this is I think this is what the house Democrats think of people
[1:12:11.280 --> 1:12:15.560]  who are Keynesian who really are Keynesian think this the other example
[1:12:15.560 --> 1:12:19.040]  would be the French popular front of 1936 and the bankers like that because you
[1:12:19.040 --> 1:12:24.240]  get shoes and refrigerators and iPods but then they get the interest on that
[1:12:24.240 --> 1:12:28.440]  dance but go ahead yeah but this is as Lautenbach says this consumer led stuff
[1:12:28.440 --> 1:12:31.440]  it doesn't doesn't get anywhere it was whatever you spend it gives you a
[1:12:31.440 --> 1:12:34.400]  little bit of a lift but then you're you're back in the depression the third
[1:12:34.400 --> 1:12:39.320]  one is the hot money alternative just start the printing presses do what
[1:12:39.320 --> 1:12:43.200]  Bernanke is doing now right he's helicopter Ben Bernanke because of this
[1:12:43.200 --> 1:12:46.440]  speech where he says if you have a depression you take bails of dollar
[1:12:46.440 --> 1:12:50.480]  bills and put them on the on the front lawns of bankers and then you reflate
[1:12:50.480 --> 1:12:54.640]  the system with hot money and as Lautenbach says that doesn't work because
[1:12:54.640 --> 1:12:58.600]  a lot of that money will flee overseas as hot money and that's what we've had
[1:12:58.600 --> 1:13:03.200]  with the top right the money went to Barclays of Britain to Deutsche Bank of
[1:13:03.200 --> 1:13:08.040]  Germany to Societies General of France investments in Dubai in India in Israel
[1:13:08.040 --> 1:13:12.240]  and the US automobile industry is collapsing so that doesn't work then
[1:13:12.240 --> 1:13:17.240]  says Lautenbach what is left is building infrastructure in other words
[1:13:17.240 --> 1:13:22.520]  permanent valuable upgrades and improvements to the capital stock of
[1:13:22.520 --> 1:13:28.360]  your nation long-term durable investments in rail systems transportation
[1:13:28.360 --> 1:13:35.600]  electricity generation canals locks water systems electronic infrastructure of
[1:13:35.600 --> 1:13:40.720]  all sorts and he says the problem with that is is it's simply the banks need
[1:13:40.720 --> 1:13:45.680]  to be supported by a national bank let's say the United States decides to build
[1:13:45.680 --> 1:13:50.560]  fifty thousand miles of maglev rail and we want to have a railroad from New
[1:13:50.560 --> 1:13:54.720]  York to San Francisco we want to have a northern transcontinental a southern
[1:13:54.720 --> 1:13:59.360]  transcontinental and we have New York to San Francisco you'd issue bonds the
[1:13:59.360 --> 1:14:03.960]  bonds would be bought by banks the states of the federal government could
[1:14:03.960 --> 1:14:08.160]  issue bonds for this as long as the the person who buys the bonds can turn
[1:14:08.160 --> 1:14:12.000]  around as a banker and say to the Federal Reserve I want money for that
[1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:16.160]  and it was I'm giving you a transcontinental maglev bond priced at
[1:14:16.160 --> 1:14:19.040]  a hundred you're gonna give me ninety nine and that was you're gonna you're
[1:14:19.040 --> 1:14:23.240]  gonna discount that bond you in that case you have nationalized the Federal
[1:14:23.240 --> 1:14:27.280]  Reserve you have forced the Federal Reserve to stop doing what they're
[1:14:27.280 --> 1:14:31.000]  doing what they do now is everything for the bankers nothing for production
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:34.160]  and let's explain turn yourself on your head Bernanke let's turn Bernanke and
[1:14:34.160 --> 1:14:36.960]  his head let's explain stop let's explain this trick because this is
[1:14:36.960 --> 1:14:41.480]  subtlety while people don't get it this is the subtlety to all of this the
[1:14:41.480 --> 1:14:44.960]  media is claiming that they're covertly nationalizing everything it's the
[1:14:44.960 --> 1:14:49.080]  opposite private banks through the private Federal Reserve working with
[1:14:49.080 --> 1:14:53.480]  their revolving door minions in the Treasury are transferring everything
[1:14:53.480 --> 1:14:58.120]  offshore into their coffers so as things implode they can buy up goods so
[1:14:58.120 --> 1:15:04.640]  it's a predatory kind of cannibalistic economy okay so so so you're really
[1:15:04.640 --> 1:15:09.680]  talking about doing the opposite truly nationalizing it and then freeing up
[1:15:09.680 --> 1:15:14.800]  that power of credit to then turn you know human dreams loose and then we'll
[1:15:14.800 --> 1:15:18.440]  have literal milk and honey well yeah we can we can certainly get out of a
[1:15:18.440 --> 1:15:22.480]  depression and go in the direction of that the thing is to nationalize the
[1:15:22.480 --> 1:15:26.680]  Federal Reserve to make it a Bureau of the Treasury right now everything the
[1:15:26.680 --> 1:15:31.520]  Federal Reserve does is decided on by unelected unaccountable anonymous
[1:15:31.520 --> 1:15:35.840]  bankers especially in those Federal Reserve districts right couple of weeks
[1:15:35.840 --> 1:15:40.600]  ago helicopter Ben dumped a trillion dollars on the market by buying
[1:15:40.600 --> 1:15:43.840]  government securities that's the Federal Open Market Committee a lot of people
[1:15:43.840 --> 1:15:47.400]  on the Federal Open Market Committee come from these regional Federal Reserve
[1:15:47.400 --> 1:15:51.200]  banks they have never even been approved by the Senate they're just private
[1:15:51.200 --> 1:15:57.080]  bankers exercising usurping this power of bankers over the the government and
[1:15:57.080 --> 1:16:00.920]  that's already I think it's a terrible thing so you want to hold calls at a
[1:16:00.920 --> 1:16:05.800]  free market having bankers rob you I would say let's let's stop talking
[1:16:05.800 --> 1:16:09.040]  about free markets I've never seen one I've never heard of one I don't think
[1:16:09.040 --> 1:16:13.160]  there's been a free market for five or ten thousand years that's the point I'm
[1:16:13.160 --> 1:16:18.400]  making is they keep calling this freedom and capitalism and all of this and it's
[1:16:18.400 --> 1:16:23.840]  not it's a real economy down here and above it these these these these people
[1:16:23.840 --> 1:16:27.960]  with godlike financial powers who just create tens of trillions of nothing and
[1:16:27.960 --> 1:16:32.080]  buy up whatever they want and then they call it free market as they tax us to
[1:16:32.080 --> 1:16:36.920]  breathe reality into their false reality yeah when limbaugh says free market he
[1:16:36.920 --> 1:16:42.520]  means the sanctity of the 1.5 quadrillion dollar derivatives bubble
[1:16:42.520 --> 1:16:46.920]  which is a product of the free market remember the derivatives were illegal
[1:16:46.920 --> 1:16:52.400]  from 1936 to 1982 there had been an attempt to corner the weak price using
[1:16:52.400 --> 1:16:59.120]  options in the in the in the depression so during the new deal 1936 ban option
[1:16:59.120 --> 1:17:04.480]  trading of agricultural commodities for any reason so that's a long period when
[1:17:04.480 --> 1:17:08.320]  we were doing much better where derivatives were illegal then from in
[1:17:08.320 --> 1:17:13.520]  82 it was legalized by Ronald Reagan then we get Wendy Graham comes on the
[1:17:13.520 --> 1:17:17.600]  scene in 1992 she says we're gonna have a safe harbor for derivatives then there's
[1:17:17.600 --> 1:17:21.360]  a big fight under Clinton Brooksley born says we ought to at least make these
[1:17:21.360 --> 1:17:25.960]  reportable and then Larry Summers who's now running the the Obama regime
[1:17:25.960 --> 1:17:30.040]  economic line Larry Summers gets on the phone with Brooksley born and says how
[1:17:30.040 --> 1:17:34.360]  dare you how dare you call for the reportability of derivatives so with the
[1:17:34.360 --> 1:17:41.440]  help of Greenspan and Ruben and Summers and and and now the current crew the
[1:17:41.440 --> 1:17:46.520]  Geithners and and and Paulson's and so forth the idea is that the derivatives
[1:17:46.520 --> 1:17:50.760]  have become the center of the economy but they don't dare say this they say
[1:17:50.760 --> 1:17:57.680]  toxic assets, counter parties, unwind, exotic instruments, complex derivatives
[1:17:57.680 --> 1:18:02.240]  but they generally don't want to say derivatives. It's the center of the
[1:18:02.240 --> 1:18:05.760]  black hole and they put right around in priest robes saying we're the
[1:18:05.760 --> 1:18:08.880]  magical Federal Reserve you can't question us you're a communist you're
[1:18:08.880 --> 1:18:13.000]  communist when really they're literally the people feeding everything into
[1:18:13.000 --> 1:18:16.360]  their fraud it's like counterfeiting with derivatives they just make up crap
[1:18:16.360 --> 1:18:20.120]  and now that it's all falling in they say you've got to have your taxes raised
[1:18:20.120 --> 1:18:24.720]  to pay for this and they call that free market as Obama announces in the Wall
[1:18:24.720 --> 1:18:28.000]  Street Journal they're gonna gut the whole tax code to go after even the
[1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:32.080]  poorest people with basically no tax exemptions on your house education
[1:18:32.080 --> 1:18:38.960]  nothing and then they call this free market. Yeah we know how to get out of a
[1:18:38.960 --> 1:18:42.560]  depression you get out of a depression by doing things like first of all wiping
[1:18:42.560 --> 1:18:46.840]  out derivatives they were illegal make them illegal again shred them delete
[1:18:46.840 --> 1:18:51.080]  them get rid of them ban adjustable rate mortgage arrest the bankers arrest the
[1:18:51.080 --> 1:18:56.720]  bankers arrest arrest somebody like like Geithner who was sitting at the Federal
[1:18:56.720 --> 1:19:01.840]  Reserve there and in New York City and arranged to get that money for for AIG
[1:19:01.840 --> 1:19:07.680]  and Paulson from Goldman Sachs who made sure that the tarp was designed so that
[1:19:07.680 --> 1:19:11.440]  the biggest single beneficiary of the tarp so far seems to be Goldman Sachs
[1:19:11.440 --> 1:19:16.040]  his company so he's got colossal conflicts of interest this guy summers
[1:19:16.040 --> 1:19:20.600]  also his his role in bringing the derivatives plague into the world and
[1:19:20.600 --> 1:19:26.600]  don't forget Greenspan so get rid of derivatives outlaw hedge funds AIG is
[1:19:26.600 --> 1:19:31.160]  two things AIG is a hedge fund in London that sells derivatives let's never have
[1:19:31.160 --> 1:19:35.840]  that again let's ban hedge funds let's wipe out derivatives let's stop foreclosures
[1:19:35.840 --> 1:19:39.920]  you want to stop foreclosures easy make it illegal federal law no more
[1:19:39.920 --> 1:19:44.560]  foreclosures five years or the duration of the crisis or it will continue to
[1:19:44.560 --> 1:19:48.480]  infect and and and create a black hole in what's left of the real yeah you can
[1:19:48.480 --> 1:19:51.520]  work that out and then it's donated stay there though and I don't want to hear
[1:19:51.520 --> 1:19:56.000]  this is socialism folks because 12 trillion of the bankers that is just
[1:19:56.000 --> 1:19:59.120]  highway robbery that we need to arrest these people and we have to start
[1:19:59.120 --> 1:20:02.680]  thinking about that idea stay there Webster
[1:20:04.680 --> 1:20:09.160]  let's go to the heart of the matter life-changing T's had some commercials

[1:21:00.400 --> 1:21:04.240]  hello Ted Anderson listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal
[1:21:04.240 --> 1:21:07.920]  Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending therefore with
[1:21:07.920 --> 1:21:11.640]  catastrophic events it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently
[1:21:11.640 --> 1:21:15.080]  placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts
[1:21:15.080 --> 1:21:19.080]  a fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held
[1:21:19.080 --> 1:21:22.560]  in reserve for immediate withdrawal deficit spending will skyrocket through
[1:21:22.560 --> 1:21:26.200]  FDIC if the government is forced to ensure deposits during a bank run
[1:21:26.200 --> 1:21:30.040]  followed by a depressed economy a current effort is underway by the Fed
[1:21:30.040 --> 1:21:34.240]  along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors however an
[1:21:34.240 --> 1:21:37.880]  increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity can cause
[1:21:37.880 --> 1:21:41.680]  inflation in order to achieve strength and stability I recommend a
[1:21:41.680 --> 1:21:46.080]  conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and
[1:21:46.080 --> 1:21:50.800]  silver while paper investments currently have been driven by debt gold on its own
[1:21:50.800 --> 1:21:56.320]  has held value for over 6,000 years for more information call 1-800-686-2237

[1:22:03.880 --> 1:22:08.680]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear we've got to give them a stake in
[1:22:08.680 --> 1:22:13.280]  creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see the
[1:22:13.280 --> 1:22:17.920]  Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best
[1:22:17.920 --> 1:22:22.480]  interest of the American people while Obama's already fudging yeah but since
[1:22:22.480 --> 1:22:26.920]  day one of this election if you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement

[1:22:31.640 --> 1:22:38.480]  bankers and finance oligarchs that's fascism it's not about left to right
[1:22:38.480 --> 1:22:44.040]  it's about a one-world government this film documents who Obama works for the

[1:24:51.320 --> 1:24:57.360]  us till 50 after these gotta go catches plane Webster look for viewers out there
[1:24:57.360 --> 1:25:03.640]  for people out there that are watching and listening to us right now if you
[1:25:03.640 --> 1:25:07.600]  want to go after the bankers we can politically all day wait for the next
[1:25:07.600 --> 1:25:11.800]  congressional election or try to wait for their president and hope but I agree
[1:25:11.800 --> 1:25:16.160]  with Ron Paul we have to criminally go after them they've all broken all sorts
[1:25:16.160 --> 1:25:20.320]  of laws they've involved in so many different types of in bezeling and
[1:25:20.320 --> 1:25:23.760]  conflicts of interest and when you start those criminal investigations with
[1:25:23.760 --> 1:25:26.840]  grand juries when you start those indictments then more and more of them
[1:25:26.840 --> 1:25:30.600]  will blow the whistle and you'll find out the whole crew is as bad as Bernie
[1:25:30.600 --> 1:25:35.360]  Madoff or worse and so I see politically and by the way it's a risk to come out
[1:25:35.360 --> 1:25:38.520]  and make films and radio shows and say this people don't play games because
[1:25:38.520 --> 1:25:41.400]  they know this is the most effective thing is to start beating the drum
[1:25:41.400 --> 1:25:47.280]  instead of having the bankers that engineered this crisis posing as our
[1:25:47.280 --> 1:25:53.000]  savior saying new bank of the world currency dictatorship you know currency
[1:25:53.000 --> 1:25:56.880]  control instead of them getting more power out of the crisis they've created
[1:25:56.880 --> 1:26:01.440]  we need to call for their investigation indictment and then that would
[1:26:01.440 --> 1:26:06.120]  politically bring them down and identify them as the criminals and the
[1:26:06.120 --> 1:26:11.480]  bad guys and this could be a peaceful bloodless revolution now I see that as
[1:26:11.480 --> 1:26:16.080]  the best chance to end this in a more peaceable manner and not go too much
[1:26:16.080 --> 1:26:19.480]  deeper into the depression probably not going to happen but if we try it could
[1:26:19.480 --> 1:26:22.440]  happen because what they're doing is obviously so criminal and they're so
[1:26:22.440 --> 1:26:26.160]  unpopular 98% are against them in every major poll you look at some are even
[1:26:26.160 --> 1:26:33.280]  99% so that's my basic thrust and my idea to to to circumnavigate the corrupt
[1:26:33.280 --> 1:26:37.200]  political structure get state grand juries federal grand juries to go after
[1:26:37.200 --> 1:26:40.120]  these bankers already a lot of them are falling a lot of these hedge fund guys
[1:26:40.120 --> 1:26:44.280]  and you know scammers are fully discredit them because if you don't
[1:26:44.280 --> 1:26:48.240]  they're going to expand their takeover through the crisis they've created even
[1:26:48.240 --> 1:26:51.200]  more so Webster in your own words because we're making a film here you know
[1:26:51.200 --> 1:26:56.400]  restate it are arresting them they deserve it this is a way to truly
[1:26:56.400 --> 1:27:02.080]  politically discredit them immediately I think that the possibility of
[1:27:02.080 --> 1:27:05.400]  criminal action it is certainly there let's let's just go back to the Great
[1:27:05.400 --> 1:27:10.040]  Depression in the 1930s yet these famous pecker a committee hearings the
[1:27:10.040 --> 1:27:14.560]  guy's name was Charles Mitchell he was the head of city bank the same city bank
[1:27:14.560 --> 1:27:20.160]  that brought you Ruben and Summers and Geithner and the rest of this clique so
[1:27:20.160 --> 1:27:25.040]  pecker a hearings a congressman pecker I called in this guy Mitchell and
[1:27:25.040 --> 1:27:29.040]  essentially what it was is the city bank had manipulated stock prices in the
[1:27:29.040 --> 1:27:35.600]  crash of 1929 and this got a big big public exposure and that I think was a
[1:27:35.600 --> 1:27:39.480]  kind of a cultural change a moment of cultural change when people realized
[1:27:39.480 --> 1:27:43.520]  that these bankers had created tremendous crimes now you look at more
[1:27:43.520 --> 1:27:48.520]  recent times I think the best bet realistically is an ambitious politician
[1:27:48.520 --> 1:27:52.280]  at the state level look at this guy Spitzer in New York State now he
[1:27:52.280 --> 1:27:55.800]  actually did quite a number of cases and that's why they had to get rid of him
[1:27:55.800 --> 1:27:59.760]  they didn't want Spitzer sitting in Albany while Wall Street was going
[1:27:59.760 --> 1:28:04.880]  through the situation we have now look at Andrew Cuomo certainly an
[1:28:04.880 --> 1:28:08.800]  ambitious politician right many problems of his own but he seems to have
[1:28:08.800 --> 1:28:13.920]  latched on to AIG maybe there are other state attorneys general in other states
[1:28:13.920 --> 1:28:17.440]  that would like to join in in this because they'd be performing a very
[1:28:17.440 --> 1:28:20.680]  important public service it's going to take somebody who wants to build a
[1:28:20.680 --> 1:28:24.920]  career right yeah but let's be clear about spitzer it has to be hundreds of
[1:28:24.920 --> 1:28:29.400]  counties and grand juries and others moving in unison or they'll kill them
[1:28:29.400 --> 1:28:32.720]  they'll set them up they watch them for one thing they do wrong
[1:28:32.720 --> 1:28:35.880]  spitzer of course as you know had written an editorial in a major newspaper
[1:28:35.880 --> 1:28:39.600]  saying this is criminal with derivatives and these banks we need to go after them
[1:28:39.600 --> 1:28:43.360]  and they said buddy you saw a hooker the FBI has been watching you for years
[1:28:43.360 --> 1:28:46.480]  we've been watching your bank account we're going to bring out even the
[1:28:46.480 --> 1:28:49.920]  details of the dirty stuff you did with the hooker I mean as if that wasn't an
[1:28:49.920 --> 1:28:54.080]  obvious political hit that was also a message to everybody going into their
[1:28:54.080 --> 1:28:58.040]  takeover that you mess with us we're going to bring any skeletons out of the
[1:28:58.040 --> 1:29:04.720]  closet right but I think now that the the rising populist economic rage against
[1:29:04.720 --> 1:29:09.880]  these Wall Street the exploiters and and raptors and so forth the hedge fund
[1:29:09.880 --> 1:29:14.120]  hyenas I think that they were going through a cultural shift where the
[1:29:14.120 --> 1:29:17.120]  possibility of actually doing something in this direction I would go back and
[1:29:17.120 --> 1:29:22.760]  look at the Greenspan Federal Reserve look at the clique that we impose
[1:29:22.760 --> 1:29:26.200]  there I'm not going to come back I want you to restart everything you just said
[1:29:26.200 --> 1:29:30.440]  and then bring in all the information in one big piece here for people because
[1:29:30.440 --> 1:29:34.160]  you want solutions this is it state sovereignty declaring 10th Amendment
[1:29:34.160 --> 1:29:38.160]  sovereignty arresting bankers you know going after the criminals they're
[1:29:38.160 --> 1:29:43.520]  obviously publicly criminals gang raiding us financially publicly you need to get
[1:29:43.520 --> 1:29:47.680]  the cry in you going forget about the bonuses that's a distraction arrest the
[1:29:47.680 --> 1:29:54.680]  criminal bankers or we're slaves we're on the march the empires on the run

[1:36:13.680 --> 1:36:18.760]  the 23 minutes we have left I'm gonna attempt to just sit back here and let
[1:36:18.760 --> 1:36:23.160]  you roll but but we were getting into the fact of arresting these people that
[1:36:23.160 --> 1:36:26.560]  being good that's the right thing to do it's they're clearly criminals they've
[1:36:26.560 --> 1:36:30.240]  broken all these laws let's go through some of that this is the way because
[1:36:30.240 --> 1:36:33.520]  they've got the political system or their control we've got to move on them
[1:36:33.520 --> 1:36:37.120]  for their criminal activities we've got to move with Ron Paul for the audit of
[1:36:37.120 --> 1:36:39.640]  the private Federal Reserve we've got to point out that in congressional
[1:36:39.640 --> 1:36:44.080]  testimony time and time again the Federal Reserve and others say we won't
[1:36:44.080 --> 1:36:49.760]  tell you where the money went this is outrageous stuff going past the level
[1:36:49.760 --> 1:36:55.560]  of lunacy this is political you know Excalibur we have to crush these people
[1:36:55.560 --> 1:36:59.360]  they've committed crimes publicly they're they're they're running wild it's
[1:36:59.360 --> 1:37:04.960]  either them or rush Webster Tarpoli the president of the Pekora hearings back
[1:37:04.960 --> 1:37:09.120]  in the 1930s where they essentially put Charles Mitchell of Citibank on the hot
[1:37:09.120 --> 1:37:13.240]  seat and he had to tell how he had rigged the stock market and stolen
[1:37:13.240 --> 1:37:17.640]  people's money during the crash of 1929 and following you've also had the
[1:37:17.640 --> 1:37:22.480]  interesting precedent set more recently by Governor Elliot Spitzer when he was
[1:37:22.480 --> 1:37:27.040]  the the Attorney General there in the state of New York even Cuomo now going
[1:37:27.040 --> 1:37:32.200]  into AIG and I think there's there's a lot of investigation that has to be done
[1:37:32.200 --> 1:37:36.400]  there right there's this proverb that you can't tell who's swimming naked until
[1:37:36.400 --> 1:37:41.280]  the tide goes out and the tide of course is the crash and as the economy
[1:37:41.280 --> 1:37:45.040]  crashes down you're going to find a lot of people who were thought to be masters
[1:37:45.040 --> 1:37:49.760]  of human destiny financial geniuses and whiz kids turn out to be embezzlers
[1:37:49.760 --> 1:37:55.360]  derivatives merchants and so forth but I think at them at the highest level it's
[1:37:55.360 --> 1:37:59.560]  audit the Federal Reserve they have never been audited that will lead us back to
[1:37:59.560 --> 1:38:04.240]  Paul Adolf Volcker who is now sitting in the Obama White House he's I think one
[1:38:04.240 --> 1:38:08.840]  of the most influential and powerful people there you've got Greenspan who
[1:38:08.840 --> 1:38:13.640]  has now confessed that his entire economic line was completely wrong that
[1:38:13.640 --> 1:38:19.840]  he he didn't understand economics and and screwed it up terribly and then
[1:38:19.840 --> 1:38:25.520]  you've got Bernanke helicopter bin now that gets us into the current time under
[1:38:25.520 --> 1:38:31.960]  Bush we had Hank Paulson hanky-panky Paulson from Goldman Sachs and he is
[1:38:31.960 --> 1:38:38.440]  the one who decreed this $700 billion original bailout the so-called tarp and
[1:38:38.440 --> 1:38:44.040]  that we see now in retrospect that Goldman Sachs his company was not only
[1:38:44.040 --> 1:38:49.000]  the beneficiary of about 20 billion directly from the tarp but in terms of
[1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:55.600]  the bailout of AIG 10 to 15 billion of that also went to Goldman Sachs in addition
[1:38:55.600 --> 1:39:01.320]  to the foreign banks Barclays Societies General and Deutsche Bank so what's the
[1:39:01.320 --> 1:39:05.960]  conflict of interest on Hank Paulson as secretary of the Treasury and remember
[1:39:05.960 --> 1:39:12.200]  this is the guy who demanded dictatorial power to use that money in any way he
[1:39:12.200 --> 1:39:16.960]  wanted now you've got Geithner continuing the same policy Geithner was in
[1:39:16.960 --> 1:39:23.480]  the same room with Paulson back in in September of last year when when Lehman
[1:39:23.480 --> 1:39:28.120]  Brothers and AIG and Maryland so forth went under now you've got Geithner who
[1:39:28.120 --> 1:39:33.160]  says he wants to be able to seize any company he wants for any reason he wants
[1:39:33.160 --> 1:39:37.920]  now what's what's their policy I would say the designated winners in this
[1:39:37.920 --> 1:39:44.680]  corporate state that we have now are Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase those
[1:39:44.680 --> 1:39:50.000]  those are the the fortress of the of the derivatives financiers other
[1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:55.160]  institutions Bank of America City Bank are being protected but they're gonna
[1:39:55.160 --> 1:40:02.080]  be I think likely to go down first Geithner is obviously feeding viable
[1:40:02.080 --> 1:40:06.320]  companies his idea is to feed viable companies into these bankrupt banks take
[1:40:06.320 --> 1:40:12.320]  the question of Washington Mutual now this was a viable savings bank the
[1:40:12.320 --> 1:40:17.480]  largest in the country with a very large deposit base and last September under
[1:40:17.480 --> 1:40:22.880]  Paulson this was seized it was seized actually by Sheila Bayer another very
[1:40:22.880 --> 1:40:28.480]  important person BAI BA IR she's the head of the Federal Deposit Insurance
[1:40:28.480 --> 1:40:34.680]  Corporation she was kept over from the Bush era into the Obama era she
[1:40:34.680 --> 1:40:40.600]  decreed the seizure of Washington Mutual and fed that into JP Morgan JP Morgan of
[1:40:40.600 --> 1:40:47.200]  course had also gotten Bear Stearns sort of engulfed into it but the idea was
[1:40:47.200 --> 1:40:51.760]  that the deposit base and the assets of Washington Mutual could be used to prop
[1:40:51.760 --> 1:40:57.720]  up JP Morgan Chase now I think that that Sheila Bayer is actually violating the
[1:40:57.720 --> 1:41:02.440]  laws perhaps the most flagrant way you look at JP Morgan Chase City Bank Bank
[1:41:02.440 --> 1:41:07.640]  of America couple of others Wells Fargo probably Bank of New York Mellon those
[1:41:07.640 --> 1:41:11.760]  are zombie banks well what does it mean to be a zombie bank it means that you
[1:41:11.760 --> 1:41:17.000]  you you are technically bankrupt and insolvent and what has to happen is the
[1:41:17.000 --> 1:41:22.480]  FDIC has to come in and seize you put you through essentially chapter 11
[1:41:22.480 --> 1:41:26.240]  bankruptcy or maybe chapter 7 bankruptcy in other words to wind you up
[1:41:26.240 --> 1:41:31.280]  definitively and that's what the FDIC has to do there are laws I think the
[1:41:31.280 --> 1:41:35.200]  Sheila Bayer is right now violating the laws that would normally dictate that
[1:41:35.200 --> 1:41:39.920]  she would seize the 405 or six biggest banks money center banks derivatives
[1:41:39.920 --> 1:41:45.920]  banks in Wall Street every Friday they announced some little bank right Podunk
[1:41:45.920 --> 1:41:52.480]  Center Oklahoma Bank seized Florida Bank seized Oregon Bank seized North Dakota
[1:41:52.480 --> 1:41:57.360]  but these are very small community banks why are we not applying the same
[1:41:57.360 --> 1:42:02.520]  laws to the huge zombie banks especially Wall Street and seize them I
[1:42:02.520 --> 1:42:06.200]  think that's another area that has to be investigated but you've got a mass of
[1:42:06.200 --> 1:42:11.240]  conflict of interest and corruption and indeed criminal incompetence so I think
[1:42:11.240 --> 1:42:14.400]  there's there's a lot to be done in that area okay I want to go back because you
[1:42:14.400 --> 1:42:17.840]  got cut off by the break when you were really getting into the political
[1:42:17.840 --> 1:42:22.920]  solution and justice be done by the heavens fall the way to stop them the
[1:42:22.920 --> 1:42:25.920]  quickest is to discredit them because they're all a bunch of made officer
[1:42:25.920 --> 1:42:31.280]  worse as you said running scams and you have Geithner literally feeding more
[1:42:31.280 --> 1:42:37.280]  than 12 billion dollars of the money directly in to Goldman Sachs and then
[1:42:37.280 --> 1:42:41.360]  that's not discussed how that's been served out as bonuses and so right there
[1:42:41.360 --> 1:42:45.040]  that is serious criminal activity but because they control the federal
[1:42:45.040 --> 1:42:48.800]  regulators they're put up there on a pedestal as our saviors when meanwhile
[1:42:48.800 --> 1:42:51.960]  it was summers and Ruben and others who were openly running the White House
[1:42:51.960 --> 1:42:55.880]  right now with Geithner is their minion former New York Fed head telling us how
[1:42:55.880 --> 1:42:59.640]  they're going to set up a world government to save us so I want to
[1:42:59.640 --> 1:43:05.880]  civilly get into that go ahead well the if you look at the Federal Reserve right
[1:43:05.880 --> 1:43:10.640]  they put out about ten trillion dollars of credit for these derivatives banks I
[1:43:10.640 --> 1:43:14.160]  think you can understand this best if you compare to compare to what they
[1:43:14.160 --> 1:43:19.600]  should be doing what you should be doing is to say these bloated cancerous
[1:43:19.600 --> 1:43:24.720]  speculative paper values are hopeless we're in a worldwide derivatives panic
[1:43:24.720 --> 1:43:29.120]  where we're walking around in the negative curvature on the inside of a
[1:43:29.120 --> 1:43:34.080]  collapsing bubble and common sense won't work under these circumstances you know
[1:43:34.080 --> 1:43:38.240]  normally a triangle adds up to 180 degrees if you measure the angles but
[1:43:38.240 --> 1:43:42.640]  when you're in the inside of negative curvature the triangle is not 180
[1:43:42.640 --> 1:43:47.720]  degrees it's going to be less so common sense won't help therefore we have got
[1:43:47.720 --> 1:43:51.920]  to do something out of the ordinary so what you've got to do is figure all of
[1:43:51.920 --> 1:43:56.160]  those paper values are gone forget them there's nothing you can do about it
[1:43:56.160 --> 1:43:59.760]  there's nothing you can do about stock prices housing prices a bubble
[1:43:59.760 --> 1:44:04.560]  derivatives prices they're coming down there's no force in the universe that
[1:44:04.560 --> 1:44:08.640]  could stop them from coming down the panic has started and and there's no
[1:44:08.640 --> 1:44:12.120]  way out and remember this is all being pumped up by future generations and
[1:44:12.120 --> 1:44:16.880]  currently having 12 trillion the last six months and growing tacked on to our
[1:44:16.880 --> 1:44:22.000]  backs as they raise myriads of state local federal international taxes to pay
[1:44:22.000 --> 1:44:26.040]  it again if you either we go to the pain of this collapsing now and then rebuild
[1:44:26.040 --> 1:44:32.760]  it or we feed everything into the vortex yeah in other words the there's no
[1:44:32.760 --> 1:44:35.400]  way to keep those prices up in the words there's nothing you can do about
[1:44:35.400 --> 1:44:39.920]  housing prices forget about housing prices 401k is gone unless you can
[1:44:39.920 --> 1:44:44.880]  somehow get it out they stole it IRA is gone what you have to think about is do
[1:44:44.880 --> 1:44:48.960]  we have enough houses to put roofs over the heads of people in the words how
[1:44:48.960 --> 1:44:52.840]  many homeless do you have that's your question not what housing is worth yeah
[1:44:52.840 --> 1:44:56.280]  California you've got hundreds of thousands and now coming up to a million
[1:44:56.280 --> 1:45:00.240]  empty houses almost and they're saying these middle-class people you can't
[1:45:00.240 --> 1:45:02.520]  live in a tent while you raise money to get an apartment that's what they're
[1:45:02.520 --> 1:45:05.680]  doing we're gonna stick you in a sports stadium we're gonna stick you in a
[1:45:05.680 --> 1:45:08.800]  fairgrounds with barbed wire and police with the crackheads with the mentally
[1:45:08.800 --> 1:45:12.640]  ill with the drug addicts and then we're gonna have taxpayers pay to police
[1:45:12.640 --> 1:45:16.360]  that instead of working out some deal with these empty houses to get them into
[1:45:16.360 --> 1:45:20.240]  it I don't want to hear it socialism folks no instead it's all just being
[1:45:20.240 --> 1:45:25.200]  given to the banks yeah a rational policy would be to say derivatives are
[1:45:25.200 --> 1:45:29.200]  worthless wipe them out adjustable rate mortgages are criminal inventions
[1:45:29.200 --> 1:45:34.800]  forget about them stop all foreclosures shut down the zombie banks then you have
[1:45:34.800 --> 1:45:41.040]  to say what you want to subsidize and foster and assist is tangible physical
[1:45:41.040 --> 1:45:45.760]  commodity production that's where this Detroit so you have taxes and it's for
[1:45:45.760 --> 1:45:51.520]  factories roads infrastructure rail and then that gives people well-paying
[1:45:51.520 --> 1:45:55.520]  jobs to then go buy food at the local restaurant or at the local shopping
[1:45:55.520 --> 1:45:58.560]  mall now partly we're almost out of time I want to hit a few other issues they
[1:45:58.560 --> 1:46:01.200]  have said they're now going to seize insurance companies and other banks and
[1:46:01.200 --> 1:46:08.320]  other industries and we see Obama telling the big three automakers we're
[1:46:08.320 --> 1:46:11.760]  going to tell you what you've got to do we're going to tell you how you're
[1:46:11.760 --> 1:46:15.440]  going to operate we the government is going to come in and run you but then he
[1:46:15.440 --> 1:46:18.720]  double speaks and says but this isn't nationalization well it really isn't
[1:46:18.720 --> 1:46:23.600]  it's looting and then just privately directing them so clearly they are saying
[1:46:23.600 --> 1:46:26.560]  we're gonna take over local cities and counties as they collapse so we have
[1:46:26.560 --> 1:46:30.480]  these bankers through the government taking over everything while not
[1:46:30.480 --> 1:46:34.320]  supplying the funds to start it back up again they implode it by design clearly
[1:46:34.320 --> 1:46:37.280]  and then they won't come in and prop it up they just come in with military
[1:46:37.280 --> 1:46:41.840]  force or they come in with all these orders so we see them hijacking everything
[1:46:41.840 --> 1:46:44.720]  and so speak to that and and what do we all makeers
[1:46:44.720 --> 1:46:48.560]  and then in closing when we come back i want to get into how they pyramid the
[1:46:48.560 --> 1:46:53.040]  debt what derivatives are for those understand and what this g20 means
[1:46:53.040 --> 1:46:57.600]  with this new ultra monetization where they're issuing the super currency
[1:46:57.600 --> 1:47:01.600]  yeah the the thing with detroit again is those factories are the most
[1:47:01.600 --> 1:47:05.440]  precious asset for humanity that that we still have in the in this country among
[1:47:05.440 --> 1:47:08.800]  among others what you ought to be doing with those is building equipment for a
[1:47:08.800 --> 1:47:11.760]  space program massive production of tractors to
[1:47:11.760 --> 1:47:15.920]  mechanize agriculture especially in africa the third world sudan
[1:47:15.920 --> 1:47:21.440]  bangladesh places like this you ought to be producing stuff for a maglev rail
[1:47:21.440 --> 1:47:25.280]  high-speed rail all kinds of capital goods that can come off those assembly
[1:47:25.280 --> 1:47:30.080]  lines and instead what obama wants to do is impose the gangrene economy the
[1:47:30.080 --> 1:47:34.240]  gangrene economy means these these are we covered earlier i mean specifically
[1:47:34.240 --> 1:47:36.320]  the unconstitutional nature
[1:47:36.320 --> 1:47:40.160]  of of obama saying we're not going to give you money and when you fail
[1:47:40.160 --> 1:47:43.920]  we're going to come in and in and basically hand you off to foreigners i
[1:47:43.920 --> 1:47:46.800]  mean i mean the issue of the president coming in
[1:47:46.800 --> 1:47:50.800]  and doing all of this yeah it's i think it's it's illegal and of course it's
[1:47:50.800 --> 1:47:54.000]  the corporate state in other words this this is precisely uh...
[1:47:54.000 --> 1:47:57.520]  i think uh... the uh... this may be covered by the supreme court opinion
[1:47:57.520 --> 1:48:01.040]  striking down the national recovery act in the 1930s which was
[1:48:01.040 --> 1:48:05.440]  a corporatist idea which uh... was not a good idea so they they may be in
[1:48:05.440 --> 1:48:09.200]  violation of the supreme court opinions and break down how the
[1:48:09.200 --> 1:48:14.080]  derivatives work and and and how they okay how they nest them as russian dolls
[1:48:14.080 --> 1:48:17.920]  or as a pyramidal structure yeah if you look at look at this a i g hedge fund
[1:48:17.920 --> 1:48:21.200]  in london like a i g financial products it's clear that they had
[1:48:21.200 --> 1:48:25.280]  first of all collateralized debt obligations and uh...
[1:48:25.280 --> 1:48:29.360]  and uh... credit default swaps credit default swaps the kinds of insurance
[1:48:29.360 --> 1:48:32.240]  policies that these hedge funds sell each other
[1:48:32.240 --> 1:48:35.600]  outside of normal insurance regulations so it's about
[1:48:35.600 --> 1:48:40.720]  three trillion of derivatives coming out of one hedge fund one
[1:48:40.720 --> 1:48:45.200]  in london controlled by a i g that's more than the gross national product of
[1:48:45.200 --> 1:48:49.200]  france so it's uh... uh... pyramid in the sense that
[1:48:49.200 --> 1:48:53.200]  they probably start with credit default swaps then they add a layer of
[1:48:53.200 --> 1:48:57.120]  collateralized debt obligations then they add a layer of structured investment
[1:48:57.120 --> 1:49:01.680]  vehicles you can add a couple of layers of uh... auction rate securities
[1:49:01.680 --> 1:49:05.600]  you might have some asset-backed security some mortgage-backed securities
[1:49:05.600 --> 1:49:10.640]  you mix this all up the idea then is as long as the cash flow is positive
[1:49:10.640 --> 1:49:14.160]  the leverage is positive and the profits at the top
[1:49:14.160 --> 1:49:17.120]  that are generated are absolutely astronomical
[1:49:17.120 --> 1:49:21.120]  but the promise is soon as anything goes wrong at the base any little thing
[1:49:21.120 --> 1:49:25.200]  right if if uh... dalphi begins to go bankrupt if a few
[1:49:25.200 --> 1:49:28.160]  subprime mortgages here in there get defaulted on
[1:49:28.160 --> 1:49:31.760]  then what that does is it takes all of that and it magnifies it and it
[1:49:31.760 --> 1:49:35.680]  multiplies it so that then the losses generated at the top of the pyramid are
[1:49:35.680 --> 1:49:38.320]  absolutely astronomical that's what they went through
[1:49:38.320 --> 1:49:41.600]  and so what's this cherry on top accelerating
[1:49:41.600 --> 1:49:45.840]  uh... the private IMF World Bank system now saying
[1:49:45.840 --> 1:49:49.840]  we're issuing secret currency and we won't tell you what any of this is but
[1:49:49.840 --> 1:49:53.600]  just give us more money yeah the the the group of uh... twenty
[1:49:53.600 --> 1:49:56.880]  meets tomorrow and i agree or the this week with the day after tomorrow
[1:49:56.880 --> 1:49:59.680]  so this is the london g twenty right this is ninety percent of the world
[1:49:59.680 --> 1:50:02.000]  economy it's europe uh... japan
[1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:06.480]  canada u s uh... big third world countries china brazil india
[1:50:06.480 --> 1:50:10.560]  and so forth uh... they're basically three things that the dominant guy here
[1:50:10.560 --> 1:50:14.560]  is gordon brown he's running the world economy he knows he's telling obama
[1:50:14.560 --> 1:50:17.520]  and geithner and summers and valker what to do
[1:50:17.520 --> 1:50:21.280]  along with allister darling chancellor the exchequer and mervin king
[1:50:21.280 --> 1:50:24.080]  of the bank of indian they want to do three things
[1:50:24.080 --> 1:50:27.520]  five hundred billion in cash coming from countries
[1:50:27.520 --> 1:50:31.040]  to beef up the international monetary fund that's the bank of the world
[1:50:31.040 --> 1:50:34.720]  uh... as far as i can see under dominique stauskahn a french
[1:50:34.720 --> 1:50:38.960]  banker the u.s. is supposed to give one hundred billion to that five times what
[1:50:38.960 --> 1:50:42.720]  we gave for food stamps twice what we had for infrastructure in this country
[1:50:42.720 --> 1:50:45.920]  goes to the island stop there stop there man
[1:50:45.920 --> 1:50:48.800]  we're gonna come right back ladies and gentlemen webster griffin tarbley
[1:50:48.800 --> 1:50:52.160]  they keep calling it a stimulus all it is is money to bankers
[1:50:52.160 --> 1:50:55.520]  to keep as they freeze credit you've noticed they've announced credits even
[1:50:55.520 --> 1:50:57.920]  tighter they're not wanting for houses and cars
[1:50:57.920 --> 1:51:02.080]  but they keep saying give us more money will loan to you it's all alive
[1:51:02.080 --> 1:51:06.080]  do you have trouble sleeping due to sensations in your legs
[1:51:06.080 --> 1:51:10.800]  you are not alone millions of americans suffer from restless legs
[1:51:10.800 --> 1:51:15.280]  restless legs is a condition caused by the uncontrollable urge to move your
[1:51:15.280 --> 1:51:18.480]  legs signs include itching pulling tugging
[1:51:18.480 --> 1:51:21.360]  and the feeling that bugs are crawling on your legs

[1:54:39.440 --> 1:54:42.000]  california where we have reporters they're shooting footage for this new
[1:54:42.000 --> 1:54:45.600]  film as well okay so we've gotten to the g20
[1:54:45.600 --> 1:54:48.880]  where they're openly announcing a europe of the world run by england we're
[1:54:48.880 --> 1:54:52.240]  watching the parliament last week taping it to put in the film
[1:54:52.240 --> 1:54:55.840]  openly announcing world government tracking everybody down a global tax
[1:54:55.840 --> 1:54:59.760]  rate of over 80 to feed the banks i mean this is a to save the polar bears
[1:54:59.760 --> 1:55:02.880]  yes well they say that i mean this is night marriage world
[1:55:02.880 --> 1:55:07.200]  government so speak about that and this currency dictatorship yeah
[1:55:07.200 --> 1:55:11.680]  gordon brown and his crew are running this g20 and what they want is
[1:55:11.680 --> 1:55:15.520]  500 billion from various countries 100 billion from the u.s
[1:55:15.520 --> 1:55:20.240]  that's to to be able to impose imf dictatorship on the countries that are
[1:55:20.240 --> 1:55:23.200]  forced to turn to the imf for loans places like
[1:55:23.200 --> 1:55:27.040]  poland ukraine bielorus rumania iceland turkey
[1:55:27.040 --> 1:55:30.480]  and so forth a lot of those countries already under imf dictatorship because
[1:55:30.480 --> 1:55:34.000]  when you get the loan you give up your sovereignty it's a dictate right
[1:55:34.000 --> 1:55:37.280]  they give you a letter of intent and and you've got to do what it says
[1:55:37.280 --> 1:55:41.840]  then there's also the special drawing rights hyperinflation on top of all
[1:55:41.840 --> 1:55:45.760]  this that not only did they demand cash money from the various countries
[1:55:45.760 --> 1:55:48.560]  but they've got these things called special drawing rights right basket of
[1:55:48.560 --> 1:55:52.640]  currencies a derivative if you will and they're multiplying those so the imf
[1:55:52.640 --> 1:55:55.920]  is going to issue more and more special drawing rights and now we're going to
[1:55:55.920 --> 1:56:00.000]  have two-tier hyperinflation we're going to have the hyperinflation in the
[1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:02.960]  dollar the euro maybe the yen maybe others
[1:56:02.960 --> 1:56:06.480]  and then on top of that a second layer of hyperinflated
[1:56:06.480 --> 1:56:09.840]  special drawing rights the sdrs i think would be the world currency
[1:56:09.840 --> 1:56:13.280]  they also want to have the imf become the world regulator
[1:56:13.280 --> 1:56:17.120]  in other words the currency dictator of the world
[1:56:17.120 --> 1:56:21.360]  mainly uh marching to the orders of uh... of the gordon brown
[1:56:21.360 --> 1:56:24.800]  and the bank of england yeah he found a g20 and then when he's there
[1:56:24.800 --> 1:56:28.320]  they openly call him basically the world leader yeah i mean they are they're
[1:56:28.320 --> 1:56:32.640]  bound out he's the new canes right so the other thing is no protectionism
[1:56:32.640 --> 1:56:35.600]  when he when gordon brown came and gave his speech to the joint session of the
[1:56:35.600 --> 1:56:38.160]  u.s congress no that means no tax incentives
[1:56:38.160 --> 1:56:41.680]  to have the company stay here tax incentives to have him leave yeah right
[1:56:41.680 --> 1:56:44.640]  and you you couldn't have an investment tax credit right you couldn't say we'll
[1:56:44.640 --> 1:56:47.600]  give you a tax break if you implement new technology and there's a stimulus
[1:56:47.600 --> 1:56:50.640]  package it can't be spent in the u.s because that violates it right it has to
[1:56:50.640 --> 1:56:53.520]  go to dubai and obama's announced that he's announced you
[1:56:53.520 --> 1:56:57.280]  you know it's also the stuff about nafta kafta wto
[1:56:57.280 --> 1:57:00.480]  you can't touch any of that you can't have exchange controls you can't have
[1:57:00.480 --> 1:57:02.960]  capital controls you can't have uh...
[1:57:02.960 --> 1:57:07.040]  you can't have anything imagine you know the united states may soon have to go
[1:57:07.040 --> 1:57:11.040]  to the imf that this is the the the really tragic thing
[1:57:11.040 --> 1:57:13.920]  when you go to the imf you give up your sovereignty now there are two
[1:57:13.920 --> 1:57:17.440]  possibilities and understate department memorandum 200
[1:57:17.440 --> 1:57:21.040]  one-child policies what the curriculum is we go under
[1:57:21.040 --> 1:57:26.160]  the internationalist law yeah so either the u.s will declare the imf
[1:57:26.160 --> 1:57:31.280]  illegal which under obama i'm afraid is not uh... a very close possibility or
[1:57:31.280 --> 1:57:35.440]  the imf will declare the u.s illegal and uh... it bankrupt essentially
[1:57:35.440 --> 1:57:38.560]  and and impose these these conditionalities there's the other thing
[1:57:38.560 --> 1:57:42.320]  at the at the london g twenty the stuff about worldwide stimulus
[1:57:42.320 --> 1:57:45.840]  this is valker i think this is an old idea from carter mondale
[1:57:45.840 --> 1:57:50.400]  when carter mondale came in in 1977 they had this idea that japan and germany
[1:57:50.400 --> 1:57:54.000]  with the locomotives of the world they sent mondale on a special trip
[1:57:54.000 --> 1:57:58.640]  to uh... to both of them saying you guys have got to start printing money
[1:57:58.640 --> 1:58:03.360]  stimulating what they mean by this is they're afraid of a dollar collapse
[1:58:03.360 --> 1:58:08.080]  they want to make sure that all the other currencies are as weak or weaker
[1:58:08.080 --> 1:58:11.360]  than the dollar so they are that's what they say all of them inflating all of
[1:58:11.360 --> 1:58:15.920]  them inflating all of them inflating so that the dollar is not the weakest of
[1:58:15.920 --> 1:58:19.760]  them but france and germany saying no and i think that's an interesting thing
[1:58:19.760 --> 1:58:24.160]  that obama is not going to get everything he wants the british of course are
[1:58:24.160 --> 1:58:27.760]  with obama telling obama what to do but there are other people france and
[1:58:27.760 --> 1:58:31.120]  germany saying no on some of of what they're demanding you know what let's do
[1:58:31.120 --> 1:58:33.760]  five more than you got it for uh... for russia china's

[2:01:58.640 --> 2:02:01.360]  in front of the queen it's a moment of great humiliation
[2:02:01.360 --> 2:02:05.440]  for the united states so he's going to be received by queen elizabeth
[2:02:05.440 --> 2:02:10.320]  um this of course this family i wonder if prince charles will be there
[2:02:10.320 --> 2:02:13.680]  he's being received on april fools day tomorrow
[2:02:13.680 --> 2:02:17.520]  then he goes on to europe for the g-20 and it says london telegraph he is
[2:02:17.520 --> 2:02:21.200]  practicing etiquette and gifts and how to bow to her
[2:02:21.200 --> 2:02:25.920]  london the kowtow and we all there if by the way the first sitting u.s president
[2:02:25.920 --> 2:02:29.440]  to go for an audience he has been summoned it's the first u.s president
[2:02:29.440 --> 2:02:33.280]  well my friend phil berg of philadelphia it has
[2:02:33.280 --> 2:02:38.240]  has a case in in federal court which according to which obama may well be a
[2:02:38.240 --> 2:02:41.840]  citizen of the british empire by virtue of being born in kenya
[2:02:41.840 --> 2:02:44.960]  which would make him illa ineligible for the presidency
[2:02:44.960 --> 2:02:48.400]  he's either a citizen of kenya or of indonesia indonesia may be a little
[2:02:48.400 --> 2:02:52.080]  more likely but he may indeed be a citizen of kenya i think it's uh
[2:02:52.080 --> 2:02:56.480]  there's a real question about whether he's qualified to be the president
[2:02:56.480 --> 2:02:59.680]  suppose prince charles is there you know you want to converse with france
[2:02:59.680 --> 2:03:02.800]  charles prince charles went on television a while ago and he said
[2:03:02.800 --> 2:03:07.760]  these are my plants i talked to them and they talked back to me i guess talking
[2:03:07.760 --> 2:03:10.800]  to plants is okay but when they start talking back is when you got to worry
[2:03:10.800 --> 2:03:13.840]  or how about a little body nudge with prince philip
[2:03:13.840 --> 2:03:17.520]  prince philip is the guy who says if i could be reincarnated i would like to
[2:03:17.520 --> 2:03:20.400]  come back as a deadly virus to kill people
[2:03:20.400 --> 2:03:25.200]  and solve the problem of global overpopulation now that goes beyond
[2:03:25.200 --> 2:03:30.160]  beyond the 1930s dictators but i mean this is unprecedented they admit this
[2:03:30.160 --> 2:03:34.320]  is the first time a sitting u.s president who has been summoned
[2:03:34.320 --> 2:03:37.760]  will go through all of the uh... how to
[2:03:37.760 --> 2:03:41.280]  yet we got the cal tau all of the forms of worship
[2:03:41.280 --> 2:03:45.440]  going in and in reviewing line and having her i mean this is this is
[2:03:45.440 --> 2:03:49.840]  this really shows england's running at all yeah when when your country is reduced
[2:03:49.840 --> 2:03:54.080]  to a ravaged wreck and derelict floating aimlessly on the ocean of

[2:10:07.920 --> 2:10:12.160]  the cover-up of 9-11 in front of building 7 the retired police is security
[2:10:12.160 --> 2:10:14.640]  thugs for Larry Silverstein the owner of the
[2:10:14.640 --> 2:10:17.360]  world trade center complex was cashed in big time
[2:10:17.360 --> 2:10:20.800]  they show up and say we're going to say your camera's a gun your backpacks a bomb
[2:10:20.800 --> 2:10:23.920]  we know you're not a terrorist but you'll end up serving 30 days in the hole
[2:10:23.920 --> 2:10:25.600]  before they figure that out and let you out
[2:10:25.600 --> 2:10:29.520]  then police show up in blue they grab your camera they say this is a gun it's
[2:10:29.520 --> 2:10:32.640]  all on tape somebody down the street gets some video as well
[2:10:32.640 --> 2:10:35.760]  and because we happen to get away with some video that didn't frame you for a
[2:10:35.760 --> 2:10:39.280]  bomb so we have the police on tape trying to train you frame you for a bomb
[2:10:39.280 --> 2:10:43.520]  and a gun so this is par for the course they grab you they say stay here
[2:10:43.520 --> 2:10:46.720]  and you go no i want to leave and they say no do not leave
[2:10:46.720 --> 2:10:50.240]  some cops stay others go they come back and say he won't leave
[2:10:50.240 --> 2:10:54.080]  that is a frame up this is the type of criminal activity they operate in so
[2:10:54.080 --> 2:10:57.840]  that's your headline there for everybody the police are framing him
[2:10:57.840 --> 2:10:59.920]  just like they tried to frame him with a bomb
[2:10:59.920 --> 2:11:03.680]  this is the hardcore secret police crime syndicate we're dealing with with the
[2:11:03.680 --> 2:11:06.560]  new york mafia what did you say to them when they said
[2:11:06.560 --> 2:11:10.800]  oh we had other guys with the camera back in the distance that's why man he was
[2:11:10.800 --> 2:11:14.480]  arrested man he was arrested for filming me getting arrested
[2:11:14.480 --> 2:11:18.480]  Anthony was also in the building and they set him up the same way they said he
[2:11:18.480 --> 2:11:21.840]  would never leave we were never asked to leave the building i attended that
[2:11:21.840 --> 2:11:24.880]  building many times this is where i confronted David Patterson this is
[2:11:24.880 --> 2:11:29.280]  where i had an interview with pataki and charlie rose recently even with them
[2:11:29.280 --> 2:11:32.000]  come a week i walk in there show my trespasser and i'm
[2:11:32.000 --> 2:11:34.800]  allowed in i walked in there and as soon as i walked in
[2:11:34.800 --> 2:11:38.880]  there i'm detained immediately i'm told to stay there there's witnesses
[2:11:38.880 --> 2:11:43.040]  there's video but get this i came to the precinct after i got out of central
[2:11:43.040 --> 2:11:47.120]  bookings i went to the precinct where the cameras and footage was located i asked
[2:11:47.120 --> 2:11:50.800]  me for my footage and camera they said no you're not getting your camera
[2:11:50.800 --> 2:11:53.680]  you're not getting the three cameras you're not getting the footage it is
[2:11:53.680 --> 2:11:56.720]  criminal evidence and the da has to release it to you
[2:11:56.720 --> 2:12:00.160]  and it's part of a criminal investigation now let's be clear let's stop here
[2:12:00.160 --> 2:12:03.040]  because if you get some two-bit lawyer we'll just waste my nothing will happen
[2:12:03.040 --> 2:12:07.120]  you to get press releases out on this to state the whole truth they framed you
[2:12:07.120 --> 2:12:10.880]  they told you don't leave now they're grabbing your cameras which is your
[2:12:10.880 --> 2:12:15.600]  evidence and your tapes the evidence that they came up and said stay here
[2:12:15.600 --> 2:12:19.120]  and then went and lied and and and come back and say he won't leave
[2:12:19.120 --> 2:12:21.760]  and now if they erase those tapes that's more
[2:12:21.760 --> 2:12:25.920]  criminal activity this is racketeering this is organized crime
[2:12:25.920 --> 2:12:30.560]  if they do that so we have them say stay here told by correction officers and
[2:12:30.560 --> 2:12:34.960]  police officers who are refunded during this whole process that they will
[2:12:34.960 --> 2:12:38.240]  probably delete the footage as i was told by police officers
[2:12:38.240 --> 2:12:42.000]  i was in the 18th precinct at the precinct and they were telling me you're
[2:12:42.000 --> 2:12:44.400]  going to be let go in a couple hours away from this precinct
[2:12:44.400 --> 2:12:47.760]  within a couple minutes nypd intelligence came down a whole bunch of
[2:12:47.760 --> 2:12:51.440]  guys in suits came down and they said no he's going down a central book and
[2:12:51.440 --> 2:12:53.840]  they were looking through my pictures they were looking through
[2:12:53.840 --> 2:12:59.120]  everything i had literally through everything i had they were just looking
[2:12:59.120 --> 2:13:02.800]  through every single thing trying to look at any little problems with me
[2:13:02.800 --> 2:13:06.720]  trying to try to get me in trouble and they even saw pictures of me at a gun
[2:13:06.720 --> 2:13:09.440]  range and they were asking me if i had a permit or a license and they
[2:13:09.440 --> 2:13:13.680]  confiscated that camera as well in those pictures as well
[2:13:13.680 --> 2:13:16.720]  amazing yeah there in the land of the free home of the brave going after your
[2:13:16.720 --> 2:13:20.640]  second amendment well luke you know uh that's why i'd watch what you

[2:24:42.240 --> 2:24:45.280]  you guys might want to miss class but not you know because the story's hot
[2:24:45.280 --> 2:24:47.520]  right now later you won't be able to already get your story out
[2:24:47.520 --> 2:24:52.560]  that's my experience with news uh but uh going to Anthony Anthony what was
[2:24:52.560 --> 2:24:55.920]  this like I mean you're a key witness even if they confiscated the footage
[2:24:55.920 --> 2:24:59.280]  you may not give it back that they said you guys stay here
[2:24:59.280 --> 2:25:01.600]  they didn't tell you to leave and they came back and said we told you to
[2:25:01.600 --> 2:25:04.480]  leave and they're charging you with trespassing
[2:25:04.480 --> 2:25:08.720]  yeah well in in a nutshell it's a just a classic set up Alex
[2:25:08.720 --> 2:25:12.800]  uh we we came into the building we fanned out like we normally do the only
[2:25:12.800 --> 2:25:16.400]  thing that was different from this true squad and any other was that it was a
[2:25:16.400 --> 2:25:20.720]  Saturday we had a larger contingency there we had about maybe 15 people
[2:25:20.720 --> 2:25:24.560]  which might have raised some red flags uh you know just to reiterate what Luke
[2:25:24.560 --> 2:25:29.120]  said we were never told to leave uh my instance uh
[2:25:29.120 --> 2:25:32.560]  I had gone into the building initially did a little quick search right around
[2:25:32.560 --> 2:25:36.080]  to kind of get a feel for the place as soon as I went back outside to speak
[2:25:36.080 --> 2:25:40.080]  to some other we are changed members I was told by Sabrina uh you know Lucas
[2:25:40.080 --> 2:25:44.080]  and handcuffs that point I go inside uh and I'm told by an
[2:25:44.080 --> 2:25:47.920]  elevator bank to you know stay right there and uh you know a couple
[2:25:47.920 --> 2:25:50.960]  minutes later this guy grabs me brings me in an office
[2:25:50.960 --> 2:25:54.960]  and I'm being you know really harassed and I mean it's all on tape
[2:25:54.960 --> 2:25:58.320]  about being grabbed physically assaulted yelling at me telling me to
[2:25:58.320 --> 2:26:02.080]  turn off the camera um you know just just real
[2:26:02.080 --> 2:26:05.680]  you know strong arm tactics you know intimidation
[2:26:05.680 --> 2:26:08.560]  and uh that's what they want you know to go back to something you and Luke were
[2:26:08.560 --> 2:26:12.720]  speaking about you know they they they want us to back off that's what they
[2:26:12.720 --> 2:26:15.360]  want and you know I fully understand the constant question
[2:26:15.360 --> 2:26:19.440]  consequences behind our actions but they have to understand also that this is
[2:26:19.440 --> 2:26:22.560]  not going to make us back off this is not going to make us back down you know
[2:26:22.560 --> 2:26:24.960]  we're still going to fight for these first responders we're still going to
[2:26:24.960 --> 2:26:28.880]  expose these scumbags and if anything it's well I'm not telling you to back
[2:26:28.880 --> 2:26:32.240]  off I'm just saying I'm just saying I would never be alone
[2:26:32.240 --> 2:26:34.960]  how they got Luke and then they got you and they say stay right there you have
[2:26:34.960 --> 2:26:38.000]  to call every you know those witnesses you need to get their names
[2:26:38.000 --> 2:26:41.120]  because they may not give your tapes back it's just so criminal to see this
[2:26:41.120 --> 2:26:44.720]  happening uh any other key things that you want to report to folks
[2:26:44.720 --> 2:26:48.480]  Anthony well I'm surprised they actually gave the uh
[2:26:48.480 --> 2:26:51.600]  the vouchers because when we first left the police precinct
[2:26:51.600 --> 2:26:54.880]  they didn't give us vouchers for all their equipment that we had they just
[2:26:54.880 --> 2:26:58.480]  gave us vouchers for one camera and we went back saying that we have two
[2:26:58.480 --> 2:27:02.800]  other additional cameras here and uh then they wrote out the vouchers for us
[2:27:02.800 --> 2:27:06.880]  so so hopefully we will be able to get those tapes back I just wanted to uh
[2:27:06.880 --> 2:27:10.400]  also thank you one of the first things I heard when I came out of jail cell
[2:27:10.400 --> 2:27:14.240]  was uh you know you did some emergency broadcast that night so thank you and
[2:27:14.240 --> 2:27:18.720]  you know everyone else who showed some support absolutely Luke uh again
[2:27:18.720 --> 2:27:21.520]  tonight you're going to be on first hour with Jason Burma's on the info warrior
[2:27:21.520 --> 2:27:24.160]  longer if you'd like we'll clear the decks for you
[2:27:24.160 --> 2:27:26.800]  and have some of the other witnesses there hopefully you can have many there
[2:27:26.800 --> 2:27:30.800]  since we weren't able to get him on uh they're charging you all with this
[2:27:30.800 --> 2:27:33.520]  even if they convict you you've got to then do appeal
[2:27:33.520 --> 2:27:36.560]  and show how they didn't give you your evidence back and then you'll win on
[2:27:36.560 --> 2:27:39.040]  appeal then you'll have lawsuits individually
[2:27:39.040 --> 2:27:42.400]  were these mainly plain clothes officers on you from the photos I've seen
[2:27:42.400 --> 2:27:47.040]  were there any uh guys in the blue no it was initially it was just you know just
[2:27:47.040 --> 2:27:52.240]  plain clothes uh Bloomberg's goons uh hotel security staff
[2:27:52.240 --> 2:27:55.200]  and uh you know then they had called in the police those police on the
[2:27:55.200 --> 2:27:58.320]  perimeter of the building very strong because you know Bloomberg and other
[2:27:58.320 --> 2:28:01.680]  politicians were there and uh you know I was in the I was in the
[2:28:01.680 --> 2:28:05.280]  the room with security for no more than five ten minutes you know that we're
[2:28:05.280 --> 2:28:09.440]  trying to grab the camera out of my lap as I was recording grabbing my arms
[2:28:09.440 --> 2:28:13.440]  and within 10 minutes the cops are there and you know we were taken out

[2:35:25.360 --> 2:35:29.280]  and um you know it's right at the edge of town and you go right over
[2:35:29.280 --> 2:35:34.160]  some railroad tracks where levy is and you could see uh there's at least
[2:35:34.160 --> 2:35:38.640]  in just one little area there's at least uh 300 tents kind of spread out over
[2:35:38.640 --> 2:35:45.440]  um a few acres and um from there it goes uh the levy runs right along the
[2:35:45.440 --> 2:35:49.840]  river and then you know they say it runs back another six miles there's
[2:35:49.840 --> 2:35:54.080]  pockets of tents scattered in and so there's a lot of there's a lot of people
[2:35:54.080 --> 2:35:58.560]  here it's really windy right now it's been hard to get good uh good audio for
[2:35:58.560 --> 2:36:04.080]  the interviews we have to get inside a tent to keep uh keep the wind out
[2:36:04.080 --> 2:36:08.000]  but uh we've met a met a lot of nice people um and they say they're not
[2:36:08.000 --> 2:36:11.280]  going to move you know they say they try to make this move we'll just
[2:36:11.280 --> 2:36:16.000]  grab our stuff and walk off listen i want you guys next to hike all the way

[2:36:25.520 --> 2:36:28.160]  and show how there's a whole community down in there
[2:36:28.160 --> 2:36:32.960]  uh you know the media says 145 tents but then local news is set up to 300
[2:36:32.960 --> 2:36:38.880]  tents how many people just in this one uh archipelago of uh people living on the
[2:36:38.880 --> 2:36:42.880]  edge well i would say i would say it's
[2:36:42.880 --> 2:36:48.560]  definitely more than than three fifth uh people that i've seen um walking around
[2:36:48.560 --> 2:36:52.640]  we we counted the tents in just the one area that we're at we have uh
[2:36:52.640 --> 2:36:56.240]  there's 85 in one section then it runs along a fence line where there's another
[2:36:56.240 --> 2:37:00.000]  like 30 and then there's another section that opens up and that's got 40
[2:37:00.000 --> 2:37:03.040]  there and then even before you get to those
[2:37:03.040 --> 2:37:05.760]  areas there's you know pockets of 10 tents here and
[2:37:05.760 --> 2:37:09.760]  other 15 here you go across the bridge there's some underneath the bridge
[2:37:09.760 --> 2:37:13.360]  so they've they've really you know scoped that area out and you know they
[2:37:13.360 --> 2:37:16.960]  say look we're not we're not bothering anybody we're out of the way
[2:37:16.960 --> 2:37:20.480]  um you know they really don't have a lot of crime there we were there till 10 30
[2:37:20.480 --> 2:37:24.160]  last night and we at at no point do we ever feel
[2:37:24.160 --> 2:37:28.240]  threatened you know uh now what type of folks are these we've seen newscast
[2:37:28.240 --> 2:37:32.080]  where it's lower middle class people who got a bad mortgage lost everything they
[2:37:32.080 --> 2:37:35.360]  can't get credit for the two three month down payment for an apartment or a
[2:37:35.360 --> 2:37:39.200]  rent house so they're most of them have said they're trying to save money
[2:37:39.200 --> 2:37:41.920]  to get out of there and that they're going and leaving with their cars to
[2:37:41.920 --> 2:37:45.280]  jobs right well and that's an interesting thing we
[2:37:45.280 --> 2:37:48.720]  met one guy who's been working he's been out there for about a year now and he
[2:37:48.720 --> 2:37:51.680]  has a day job he works every day in construction
[2:37:51.680 --> 2:37:55.120]  he comes back and lives there and he just you know he likes the freedom
[2:37:55.120 --> 2:37:58.720]  um he doesn't he doesn't really want to have an apartment you know why these
[2:37:58.720 --> 2:38:02.720]  people uh well we've been finding is that they want to be out here they're not
[2:38:02.720 --> 2:38:06.400]  looking uh to be part of the system we have met people who've been
[2:38:06.400 --> 2:38:09.760]  out of their apartment for not making rent and then they have to make that
[2:38:09.760 --> 2:38:13.200]  money that two months plus a deposit and then if they have a
[2:38:13.200 --> 2:38:16.000]  dog or you know or a cat you know it's another
[2:38:16.000 --> 2:38:20.640]  three or four hundred on top of that so we we have to find a person that said
[2:38:20.640 --> 2:38:23.360]  they've been that they've lost their mortgage although
[2:38:23.360 --> 2:38:27.680]  um what we're hearing from the people is that um
[2:38:27.680 --> 2:38:30.880]  a lot of the people we've talked to is that there's uh
[2:38:30.880 --> 2:38:34.000]  they there's one guy that lost his mortgage and he was there for about a
[2:38:34.000 --> 2:38:37.280]  month and a half and then he left but he still comes back to bring stuff for
[2:38:37.280 --> 2:38:41.840]  people um so what we're thinking of is from to
[2:38:41.840 --> 2:38:45.280]  us from what we've been gathering is that that has kind of been hyped up
[2:38:45.280 --> 2:38:49.040]  in order to create the news story but these you know a lot of people said
[2:38:49.040 --> 2:38:51.440]  they've they've been out here for years there have been some people have been
[2:38:51.440 --> 2:38:54.720]  out there for a few months a lot of people they're either getting kicked
[2:38:54.720 --> 2:38:59.200]  out of their house by their spouse or they're just losing their apartment
[2:38:59.200 --> 2:39:02.960]  because they can't pay rent we met one guy who is a director of sales
[2:39:02.960 --> 2:39:07.840]  for his uh his company this small company was a flooring and towel company
[2:39:07.840 --> 2:39:11.440]  and the company went under and he lost his job and he hasn't been able to find
[2:39:11.440 --> 2:39:15.120]  a new one and he was staying at the Cal Expo Center for a while
[2:39:15.120 --> 2:39:19.520]  but you got to really hear about this Cal Expo Center this place is definitely
[2:39:19.520 --> 2:39:23.120]  this is like a FEMA camp in the making I mean
[2:39:23.120 --> 2:39:26.720]  but you have to be there you have to be at the pickup point by 3 p.m and they
[2:39:26.720 --> 2:39:29.600]  bust you over to it so you're not allowed to bring
[2:39:29.600 --> 2:39:32.960]  hardly any personal possessions you can bring a backpack and a bicycle if you
[2:39:32.960 --> 2:39:36.640]  have a bicycle and they put those in a storage unit for you
[2:39:36.640 --> 2:39:40.400]  when you walk in and the guy's telling us all this we have it all on tape he said
[2:39:40.400 --> 2:39:43.200]  first they wind you down and then they pat you down
[2:39:43.200 --> 2:39:46.960]  no it's listen listen listen i mean go over but this is what i kept telling
[2:39:46.960 --> 2:39:50.560]  people they say they have in the news cps in there if you have kids
[2:39:50.560 --> 2:39:54.000]  they say oh your child's in danger they grab them so they won't let you go out
[2:39:54.000 --> 2:39:56.320]  and live in the woods or go out and live on the side of the road or you know
[2:39:56.320 --> 2:39:59.520]  live by a river and they try to raise money they're going to force you in
[2:39:59.520 --> 2:40:03.600]  with the crack heads with the heroin heads with the schizophrenics with the
[2:40:03.600 --> 2:40:07.440]  you know the kind of baseline of classic homeless
[2:40:07.440 --> 2:40:11.840]  with this new homeless the working poor integrating them into this hellhole taking
[2:40:11.840 --> 2:40:15.920]  their basic freedom away and and as the economy implodes you're going to see
[2:40:15.920 --> 2:40:18.720]  more and more of this and this is the precedent obama has said
[2:40:18.720 --> 2:40:22.240]  and the bills introduced to set up these fema camps
[2:40:22.240 --> 2:40:26.560]  and your prisoners in them uh... so so so what are they saying that what are
[2:40:26.560 --> 2:40:29.280]  they saying that the expo center the fairgrounds
[2:40:29.280 --> 2:40:32.560]  is like and are they saying they're going to be forced in
[2:40:32.560 --> 2:40:36.160]  well a lot of them said they're not going to go if they said they try to force
[2:40:36.160 --> 2:40:38.720]  them in they're going to say no and they're either going to grab what they
[2:40:38.720 --> 2:40:42.400]  can grab and move farther back into the woods
[2:40:42.400 --> 2:40:45.200]  um because of what's been happening they've been kind of
[2:40:45.200 --> 2:40:47.920]  kicked out of different places so they've been all kind of corralled into this
[2:40:47.920 --> 2:40:51.360]  tent city area they it used to be spread out over a larger area
[2:40:51.360 --> 2:40:54.960]  and slowly people who own the different parts of property are
[2:40:54.960 --> 2:40:58.080]  either telling them to move or kicking them out or or whatever so
[2:40:58.080 --> 2:41:01.280]  it's kind of conglomerating into that but going to the expo center
[2:41:01.280 --> 2:41:05.600]  you have to be at this bus depot by 3 p.m. so there's really no way you could
[2:41:05.600 --> 2:41:09.120]  have a job because it's out at 3 p.m. you know nobody
[2:41:09.120 --> 2:41:12.160]  and and then uh they take you to this place you're not allowed to bring
[2:41:12.160 --> 2:41:16.000]  anything with you they do provide food there who knows what it's like
[2:41:16.000 --> 2:41:20.640]  um you know i i didn't see the food yet and um
[2:41:20.640 --> 2:41:24.480]  and then they're kicked out at 5 a.m. they they wake them all up put them back
[2:41:24.480 --> 2:41:27.520]  in a bus and drive them back to loaves and fishes
[2:41:27.520 --> 2:41:31.760]  so they're really not providing much but just this kind of weird environment
[2:41:31.760 --> 2:41:35.840]  that you can kind of get some sleep in because they do have some bunks there
[2:41:35.840 --> 2:41:39.120]  but they say the bunks are are made for almost children
[2:41:39.120 --> 2:41:42.880]  and they spent almost a million dollars to upgrade the facility and they added
[2:41:42.880 --> 2:41:46.560]  50 bunks there's a lot more than 50 people out here
[2:41:46.560 --> 2:41:50.320]  and you know they're not going to go i i i can see that right now they're
[2:41:50.320 --> 2:41:52.960]  they're even going to pick up their stuff and walk away
[2:41:52.960 --> 2:41:56.640]  and uh you know that what they said is before they've grabbed the stuff
[2:41:56.640 --> 2:41:59.440]  thrown it in the dumpster and then they just wait for the cops to leave and
[2:41:59.440 --> 2:42:01.680]  they go back and get their stuff out and set up their camps
[2:42:01.680 --> 2:42:05.200]  all right rob rob here's your mission i know some of them are going to have
[2:42:05.200 --> 2:42:08.960]  cell phones for their jobs and things get as many names
[2:42:08.960 --> 2:42:12.000]  numbers and cell phones get a little bit of money
[2:42:12.000 --> 2:42:16.800]  too for their minutes i want to interview them when you get back at the
[2:42:16.800 --> 2:42:19.600]  end of the week i want to have three or four of these people on kind of a
[2:42:19.600 --> 2:42:24.160]  cross section okay i want you to give them the producer cell
[2:42:24.160 --> 2:42:29.280]  phone you have the company phone to call that when all this starts
[2:42:29.280 --> 2:42:33.520]  so that we can or or a day or two if we can find out when they're coming
[2:42:33.520 --> 2:42:38.240]  i will send you back to california so we can be there
[2:42:38.240 --> 2:42:42.160]  or we can get citizen reporters we are changed or you know 911 truth or ron
[2:42:42.160 --> 2:42:46.000]  paul meetup ribs whatever uh to be to to cover this
[2:42:46.000 --> 2:42:49.280]  when they try to forcibly move them swordson agar has said sometime
[2:42:49.280 --> 2:42:52.560]  in the next month now he's been out there several times we're going to play a
[2:42:52.560 --> 2:42:54.720]  clip of that coming up in a few minutes
[2:42:54.720 --> 2:42:59.680]  um do do do they have any idea of when they're coming to throw them out
[2:42:59.680 --> 2:43:03.600]  they keep saying for for what they're thinking is the end of may is what they
[2:43:03.600 --> 2:43:06.800]  keep hearing now the end of may is the the time that they're going to have to
[2:43:06.800 --> 2:43:09.840]  be moved but they keep moving it live
[2:43:09.840 --> 2:43:14.160]  a few weeks ago was the end of april before that was the end of march and
[2:43:14.160 --> 2:43:17.520]  now it's the end of may so they keep kind of pushing out the deadline
[2:43:17.520 --> 2:43:22.160]  and um well if there's 350 people how are they going to put on something with
[2:43:22.160 --> 2:43:25.840]  50 bucks well it's it's actually got i think it's
[2:43:25.840 --> 2:43:29.120]  got a hundred bucks and then they added another 50 more we're actually going to
[2:43:29.120 --> 2:43:31.520]  go out there today and talk to some people
[2:43:31.520 --> 2:43:34.560]  um and a little bit we're going to drive out there and see what it's like
[2:43:34.560 --> 2:43:38.480]  yeah i want you i want you to be there at three if you can
[2:43:38.480 --> 2:43:41.680]  i guess you guys are scheduled to come back tomorrow
[2:43:41.680 --> 2:43:44.800]  uh yeah tomorrow late in the evening we're going to take off i think about
[2:43:44.800 --> 2:43:48.080]  6 30 at night well i mean this is a key shoot you might think about
[2:43:48.080 --> 2:43:52.080]  moving the ticket to to wednesday because i need you to go back through that
[2:43:52.080 --> 2:43:54.960]  archipelago to you know to show these are people
[2:43:54.960 --> 2:43:58.400]  literally in the wild living back here and how it's a you know a lot larger
[2:43:58.400 --> 2:44:01.680]  than what the news even shows i want to show them
[2:44:01.680 --> 2:44:04.960]  uh showing up to get on the bus at three
[2:44:04.960 --> 2:44:08.080]  okay so if you guys have to split up that's fine but that's in about two
[2:44:08.080 --> 2:44:12.400]  hours your time i want you to get up early please
[2:44:12.400 --> 2:44:18.560]  to show them coming out at five a.m okay and we're back yeah yeah how much of
[2:44:18.560 --> 2:44:21.920]  you know are are are they letting you as media
[2:44:21.920 --> 2:44:26.640]  have you been out to the expo center yet not yet um the people here were they're
[2:44:26.640 --> 2:44:29.760]  a little distrustful the media because they said the media is blowing this up
[2:44:29.760 --> 2:44:33.680]  and kind of caused the attention to come on us and now we're getting all these
[2:44:33.680 --> 2:44:37.520]  negative repercussions where before we were just kind of left alone
[2:44:37.520 --> 2:44:41.680]  to do everything one one thing though they they uh a church paid for some
[2:44:41.680 --> 2:44:45.840]  porta potties for uh they got four porta potties out there for the people
[2:44:45.840 --> 2:44:48.800]  and the city came and removed them after four days
[2:44:48.800 --> 2:44:51.920]  they said no they're not allowed to have porta potties out here
[2:44:51.920 --> 2:44:56.480]  so you know these guys are literally uh you know creating little makeshift
[2:44:56.480 --> 2:45:00.080]  bathrooms the one one guy we've interviewed who actually uh he has
[2:45:00.080 --> 2:45:04.000]  like five or six tenths set up with you know wind barriers and stuff he actually
[2:45:04.000 --> 2:45:08.080]  made himself um a bathroom that you know that they can use
[2:45:08.080 --> 2:45:12.160]  and um for for his group yeah so the city claims they want
[2:45:12.160 --> 2:45:15.760]  sanitation's why you've got to go to the prison and it is a little prison
[2:45:15.760 --> 2:45:19.920]  but then you can't have porta potties out there uh this is just outrageous
[2:45:19.920 --> 2:45:24.000]  um now what did you guys witness in los angeles
[2:45:24.000 --> 2:45:28.800]  los angeles is uh we we drove around to a lot of areas we didn't see a lot of
[2:45:28.800 --> 2:45:32.560]  uh tent city set up um we were in the uh we went to
[2:45:32.560 --> 2:45:37.280]  south central went to korea town and just driving around the whole city jason
[2:45:37.280 --> 2:45:40.800]  kind of knows the city by the back of his hand we start off in long beach
[2:45:40.800 --> 2:45:44.240]  um we went to a park where they're supposedly he said when he lived there
[2:45:44.240 --> 2:45:47.440]  there was a ton of homeless people there i've seen i've seen a tent sitting in
[2:45:47.440 --> 2:45:52.000]  downtown la but don't go ahead and um i guess they're always moving them so
[2:45:52.000 --> 2:45:54.640]  they're hard to find yeah i think i think they are well
[2:45:54.640 --> 2:45:57.600]  apparently they had some in long beach and we talked to a couple people there
[2:45:57.600 --> 2:46:00.480]  and they said no no they they moved them out a couple weeks ago
[2:46:00.480 --> 2:46:03.920]  and they even gave us uh a tip saying they brought them to this uh
[2:46:03.920 --> 2:46:08.400]  national um uh an army reserve base and they gave us the address we went over
[2:46:08.400 --> 2:46:12.240]  there we didn't see anything there and it looked like it was kind of closed up
[2:46:12.240 --> 2:46:16.080]  but there's a few vehicles and a few buildings so we didn't see anybody around
[2:46:16.080 --> 2:46:18.800]  well yeah they probably moved them there and then somewhere else that's the
[2:46:18.800 --> 2:46:22.480]  scary part you can't go sleep in a park can't sleep on a bench most places
[2:46:22.480 --> 2:46:25.760]  they arrest you can't go put a tent in the woods they show up
[2:46:25.760 --> 2:46:29.520]  and so uh i mean i was in LA a couple years ago and saw little tent cities
[2:46:29.520 --> 2:46:32.800]  in shanning towns so you're saying those are basically gone so where are these
[2:46:32.800 --> 2:46:36.640]  people going i don't know we now we met a guy we were
[2:46:36.640 --> 2:46:40.720]  driving down this road uh and we saw an interesting billboard that has
[2:46:40.720 --> 2:46:44.320]  david the Rothschild on it looking like jesus christ talking about how he's this
[2:46:44.320 --> 2:46:48.400]  echo warrior which we got some footage of and and then just down the road from
[2:46:48.400 --> 2:46:51.600]  there there's this big sign that this guy you know wrote about you know where's
[2:46:51.600 --> 2:46:54.720]  my bell out obama and he had this nice little kind of palm written
[2:46:54.720 --> 2:46:59.040]  we went in and interviewed him and he's losing his uh small business that he
[2:46:59.040 --> 2:47:02.800]  he uh put a mortgage a second mortgage out on his house to get this loan
[2:47:02.800 --> 2:47:06.960]  to teach massage he's like a chiropractor in a massages a massage
[2:47:06.960 --> 2:47:11.520]  instructor so he set up his school and it was going good but a lot of people
[2:47:11.520 --> 2:47:14.960]  he's letting people in for you know kind of free or discounted rates to teach
[2:47:14.960 --> 2:47:18.160]  him because he's he's out there just trying to help people and teach people
[2:47:18.160 --> 2:47:21.840]  and he wasn't able to keep up with his payment and his uh
[2:47:21.840 --> 2:47:25.520]  brand of the person who owned that building you know finally had to cut him
[2:47:25.520 --> 2:47:28.080]  loose since you gave him the end of the month to get out
[2:47:28.080 --> 2:47:32.000]  and uh so he's got no way to make money now and he's got a house
[2:47:32.000 --> 2:47:35.680]  that he's about to lose and and he's worried you know he might in
[2:47:35.680 --> 2:47:38.800]  two or three months he might be out on the street you know
[2:47:38.800 --> 2:47:42.240]  and and he's unable to get the loan they won't give him another loan you know
[2:47:42.240 --> 2:47:46.000]  he's just kind of in this weird area where you know he wasn't able to make
[2:47:46.000 --> 2:47:50.080]  his payments for a couple months and and that just snowballed into well now you
[2:47:50.080 --> 2:47:53.120]  have bad credit now you can't we're not going to give you any money
[2:47:53.120 --> 2:47:56.480]  and now you're going to go live on the street you know basis okay but look
[2:47:56.480 --> 2:48:00.480]  great great uh just uh i mean great that you're getting all this footage
[2:48:00.480 --> 2:48:04.960]  too bad for him uh specifically now uh you're going to get me the phone
[2:48:04.960 --> 2:48:07.920]  numbers for some of these people their names we can have them on the show and
[2:48:07.920 --> 2:48:11.200]  so they can report to us when things happen don't don't lose that number
[2:48:11.200 --> 2:48:19.520]  uh secondarily um i want you know to get you down there to see them being
[2:48:19.520 --> 2:48:23.360]  drop but being showing up to have their cars and their and their bicycles
[2:48:23.360 --> 2:48:26.800]  locked up as they go into the camp have you talked to them about letting you
[2:48:26.800 --> 2:48:30.480]  get into the camp the government facility
[2:48:30.480 --> 2:48:34.240]  in the cal expo uh i haven't uh we haven't gone up there we're going to go up
[2:48:34.240 --> 2:48:37.120]  there in a little while just to scatter it out and see what it's like
[2:48:37.120 --> 2:48:40.880]  we're going to be back at the bus depot pickup by three
[2:48:40.880 --> 2:48:45.200]  and um and we're going to interview some people at that there's a couple homeless
[2:48:45.200 --> 2:48:50.240]  shelters uh basically from where the cal uh the
[2:48:50.240 --> 2:48:53.280]  tent city is you you walk through a small neighborhood that's got a couple
[2:48:53.280 --> 2:48:57.440]  streets of houses and then a lot like uh industrial park tech stuff
[2:48:57.440 --> 2:49:00.960]  you know as a concrete maker a granite place and then an old machine shop
[2:49:00.960 --> 2:49:04.560]  and you walk through that and you hit 16th street and then you have uh you
[2:49:04.560 --> 2:49:08.480]  know a lot of the homeless shelters that are pretty much their capacity
[2:49:08.480 --> 2:49:12.320]  and uh but i want you to go get footage how those are a capacity
[2:49:12.320 --> 2:49:15.600]  or if you already got footage of that we have not got footage of that yet
[2:49:15.600 --> 2:49:19.920]  so that's okay that's a little bit hey um and then we're gonna head back up
[2:49:19.920 --> 2:49:22.960]  tonight a couple people have you know they said yeah come back up
[2:49:22.960 --> 2:49:27.520]  we'll uh you know we'll show you how we live you know how we cook dinner and
[2:49:27.520 --> 2:49:30.560]  you know they're actually you know they they're able to find food
[2:49:30.560 --> 2:49:34.160]  what you know they make they when they work they you know they make the money
[2:49:34.160 --> 2:49:37.600]  and they don't have to pay for rent so they are able to use that money for
[2:49:37.600 --> 2:49:43.040]  cell phones or for food but the key is but the key is now if they're
[2:49:43.040 --> 2:49:47.680]  forced into the tent city and they've got to be out at five in at three there's
[2:49:47.680 --> 2:49:50.720]  no way for most of them to be able to get jobs that they now have
[2:49:50.720 --> 2:49:53.840]  so here's the system making it where they can't live
[2:49:53.840 --> 2:49:58.560]  exactly there and then and then by them trying to better themselves and get a
[2:49:58.560 --> 2:50:02.640]  job you know that that option is taken away from them and that's what
[2:50:02.640 --> 2:50:06.000]  that's the crazy part about it alex it's like you know the government
[2:50:06.000 --> 2:50:10.400]  wants to pretend like it's gonna help these people but by trying to help them
[2:50:10.400 --> 2:50:13.600]  they're just creating them they're making them more dependent on the system
[2:50:13.600 --> 2:50:16.320]  which is what you know which is what i think they want to do
[2:50:16.320 --> 2:50:19.920]  to have that control over all right specifically
[2:50:19.920 --> 2:50:24.400]  um where is uh jason right now is he still interviewing people
[2:50:24.400 --> 2:50:27.600]  i think he's still interviewing i haven't seen him yet i walked back to the car
[2:50:27.600 --> 2:50:30.640]  it's about from where we parked it's about a half a mile
[2:50:30.640 --> 2:50:36.560]  uh hike in and um over the over the uh well i'm sorry i said i would have you

[3:03:16.240 --> 3:03:20.640]  all right let me let me analyze the newscast now let me analyze it
[3:03:20.640 --> 3:03:24.800]  arnold it's like he's president he's got like 15 bodyguards they even keep the
[3:03:24.800 --> 3:03:27.280]  press back arnold would shake a few hands they
[3:03:27.280 --> 3:03:30.480]  would get security guards all around he would reach his hand like three feet
[3:03:30.480 --> 3:03:33.440]  away and barely shake them like that
[3:03:33.440 --> 3:03:38.480]  and just absolutely amazing and then they picked the few people guaranteed
[3:03:38.480 --> 3:03:40.720]  who were like oh i love it oh he's so big
[3:03:40.720 --> 3:03:45.840]  oh i feel so powerful that he's here or it's so powerful
[3:03:45.840 --> 3:03:50.160]  when this is the guy who's ordering them moved out of there to the little fema
[3:03:50.160 --> 3:03:53.280]  camp where they get padded down and wanded as we told you they did now that's
[3:03:53.280 --> 3:04:01.440]  confirmed to go into the camp the the fairgrounds with barbed wire
[3:04:01.440 --> 3:04:04.160]  and you've got to be there at three you've got to leave every day at three
[3:04:04.160 --> 3:04:06.640]  o'clock you've got or you have to be there by three o'clock you have to leave at
[3:04:06.640 --> 3:04:08.800]  five a.m. very hard to have a job that way
[3:04:08.800 --> 3:04:11.440]  and then most these people are using this as a staging ground to then go get
[3:04:11.440 --> 3:04:14.880]  jobs so again that's how the media spends
[3:04:14.880 --> 3:04:19.600]  things that's how disingenuous they are and there's that
[3:04:19.600 --> 3:04:23.680]  mayor sitting there you know saying you know this is tough love yeah tough love

[3:04:29.440 --> 3:04:32.800]  official government shelters and private shelters all around
[3:04:32.800 --> 3:04:38.640]  the fairgrounds in the expo center where the people are being held
[3:04:38.640 --> 3:04:43.360]  so you're going to see more and more of this across the country

[3:06:31.040 --> 3:06:34.720]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme
[3:06:34.720 --> 3:06:38.320]  bankers and finance oligarchs that's fascism
[3:06:38.320 --> 3:06:41.840]  it's not about left or right it's about a one-world government

[3:08:38.560 --> 3:08:42.800]  much has happened in the last few weeks i apologize but i've read over material
[3:08:42.800 --> 3:08:45.360]  a lot of great research because i've done so much research on so many
[3:08:45.360 --> 3:08:47.760]  subjects i can tell when somebody's accurate info
[3:08:47.760 --> 3:08:50.240]  and is really addressing what's happening and she's got so much more
[3:08:50.240 --> 3:08:52.160]  knowledge than i do you know on this subject
[3:08:52.160 --> 3:08:54.960]  i can just vet and tell you that what she's saying is accurate
[3:08:54.960 --> 3:08:57.600]  uh... karen russo of the wrongful death and injury
[3:08:57.600 --> 3:09:01.040]  institute and uh... you can go to her website
[3:09:01.040 --> 3:09:06.320]  wrongful death uh... institute dot com will put a link to that up on screen as
[3:09:06.320 --> 3:09:09.600]  it is right now in prison planet dot t v
[3:09:09.600 --> 3:09:13.600]  uh... just boil it down for us how you got into this your research
[3:09:13.600 --> 3:09:16.880]  you cover a lot of different areas but i've heard on the radio talking about
[3:09:16.880 --> 3:09:21.040]  on the genesis network specifically prisons and people can say oh well
[3:09:21.040 --> 3:09:23.520]  they're feeding them you know half their diet or more of soy
[3:09:23.520 --> 3:09:26.640]  what's wrong with that well they admit it's full of a estrogen mimicking
[3:09:26.640 --> 3:09:30.720]  hormone them men grow brass they have serious health problems they gain weight
[3:09:30.720 --> 3:09:33.760]  uh... they're feeding us to close to half the diet in public schools is now
[3:09:33.760 --> 3:09:37.360]  soy based same thing there's not just one small issue
[3:09:37.360 --> 3:09:42.240]  you cover though isn't it yes it is well tell us about yourself what you do
[3:09:42.240 --> 3:09:44.960]  and then break down what's really happening right now in america
[3:09:44.960 --> 3:09:47.920]  well i'll tell you i'll give you the cliff note version as far as i can do it
[3:09:47.920 --> 3:09:51.200]  and i'm not real good at doing this but we'll give it a whirl
[3:09:51.200 --> 3:09:55.440]  um... we consult with families of inmates
[3:09:55.440 --> 3:09:59.360]  specifically uh... but not just necessarily in the prison system
[3:09:59.360 --> 3:10:04.800]  regarding medical and death issues medical medical issues as you well know
[3:10:04.800 --> 3:10:09.120]  can cover the gamut and that goes anywhere from dietary needs
[3:10:09.120 --> 3:10:13.680]  to the cost of prison health care within the state departments of correction
[3:10:13.680 --> 3:10:18.320]  um... and death issues insofar as it affects the medical examiner system
[3:10:18.320 --> 3:10:23.040]  nationwide and the egregious practices of the funeral home industry
[3:10:23.040 --> 3:10:27.280]  so whatever happens in a prison system when it when it comes to dealing with
[3:10:27.280 --> 3:10:30.720]  medical issues we zero in on
[3:10:30.720 --> 3:10:34.240]  basically shine a light in a very dark corner
[3:10:34.240 --> 3:10:38.000]  uh... to help families either advocate for the inmates
[3:10:38.000 --> 3:10:42.560]  that they're trying to fight for the life of or find out answers for those
[3:10:42.560 --> 3:10:45.520]  inmates that have died and the families have been
[3:10:45.520 --> 3:10:50.800]  um... disallowed the information well we know there's medical experimentation
[3:10:50.800 --> 3:10:53.600]  take huntsville texas is even leaked out in the houston chronicle
[3:10:53.600 --> 3:10:56.880]  where the jail guards started getting sick and dying and their families
[3:10:56.880 --> 3:11:00.000]  and they were selling the oxen into the prisoners backs
[3:11:00.000 --> 3:11:03.040]  uh... they were saying you don't get any good food for a year unless you do this
[3:11:03.040 --> 3:11:04.720]  they were doing medical experiments
[3:11:04.720 --> 3:11:07.520]  you know medical experiments not just to ski with black folks you know it's a
[3:11:07.520 --> 3:11:09.920]  good example folks all seem to know about that
[3:11:09.920 --> 3:11:14.080]  so that's going on uh... you've got their diet you've got just just all this
[3:11:14.080 --> 3:11:17.200]  hell of stuff break down some of the worst cases you've seen in your
[3:11:17.200 --> 3:11:19.040]  research and some of the things that are happening
[3:11:19.040 --> 3:11:24.720]  well i think the worst the worst systemic issue that that crossed our
[3:11:24.720 --> 3:11:28.000]  desk a couple years ago was the um...
[3:11:28.000 --> 3:11:31.120]  blood scandal in the arkansas department of corrections
[3:11:31.120 --> 3:11:35.200]  regarding factor eight um... and if anybody wants to really get well
[3:11:35.200 --> 3:11:38.160]  versed in that issue just go just google in the
[3:11:38.160 --> 3:11:41.760]  the key words factor eight and you'll get a wealth of information on that
[3:11:41.760 --> 3:11:44.960]  yeah bear pharmaceutical knowingly bill clinton others all the world
[3:11:44.960 --> 3:11:48.000]  for a decade after they knew it all had hiv and hepatitis
[3:11:48.000 --> 3:11:51.600]  mixed it all together as factor eight sold to hemophilia action others worldwide
[3:11:51.600 --> 3:11:56.480]  hundreds of thousands is the operative word and kelly dudah was it was the
[3:11:56.480 --> 3:12:00.960]  producer of that movie he ended up eventually a year or so ago
[3:12:00.960 --> 3:12:04.960]  testifying in london england um... regarding that issue and by the way
[3:12:04.960 --> 3:12:08.080]  the prosthesis doctor that exposed that in the first prison
[3:12:08.080 --> 3:12:11.680]  he got firebombed the same night the hemophilia exercise i'm interviewing
[3:12:11.680 --> 3:12:17.040]  it's not unusual he got firebombed in in in arkansas the same night for those
[3:12:17.040 --> 3:12:20.880]  that don't know that the hemophilia exercise suing got robbed in canada
[3:12:20.880 --> 3:12:24.160]  go ahead yeah and and honestly on the big radar
[3:12:24.160 --> 3:12:27.600]  screen of of prison health care these are just
[3:12:27.600 --> 3:12:32.800]  um... blips on the radar screen the systemic problem that we've seen over
[3:12:32.800 --> 3:12:36.720]  the last twenty years is the issue of health care
[3:12:36.720 --> 3:12:40.960]  that the taxpayers in every state are paying for
[3:12:40.960 --> 3:12:45.120]  over and above what the costs are for the department of corrections
[3:12:45.120 --> 3:12:49.040]  and these inmates are not being given and the key words are
[3:12:49.040 --> 3:12:52.240]  the adequate community standard of health care
[3:12:52.240 --> 3:12:57.840]  already paid for by your tax dollars so when they're when they're cut loose and
[3:12:57.840 --> 3:13:01.920]  there are 700,000 inmates that are released every year
[3:13:01.920 --> 3:13:04.880]  the majority of this percentage of inmates either
[3:13:04.880 --> 3:13:09.840]  have not been diagnosed with a very severe disease
[3:13:09.840 --> 3:13:13.680]  or they have been diagnosed and inadequately treated
[3:13:13.680 --> 3:13:17.520]  and they're released out into the public and everybody out here will say well
[3:13:17.520 --> 3:13:21.040]  you know hell we don't want to give inmates medical care why do we
[3:13:21.040 --> 3:13:24.400]  why did the inmates get better health care than we do out here
[3:13:24.400 --> 3:13:28.160]  and the actuality of it is no they don't
[3:13:28.160 --> 3:13:33.040]  it's a myth it's a misunderstanding of how the system is set up
[3:13:33.040 --> 3:13:38.080]  it's a very a bad misunderstanding on the general public because they're
[3:13:38.080 --> 3:13:42.240]  ignorant as to the fact of how a department of corrections works
[3:13:42.240 --> 3:13:45.920]  and how the money is managed and appropriated within the general
[3:13:45.920 --> 3:13:49.280]  assembly well it's just like the VA anything the government runs
[3:13:49.280 --> 3:13:53.440]  you see all these huge expenditures but only 30 40% actually goes to medical
[3:13:53.440 --> 3:13:57.680]  care the rest is bureaucracy corruption medical test manipulation
[3:13:57.680 --> 3:14:01.840]  but in this case what what we advocate so strongly for
[3:14:01.840 --> 3:14:05.600]  you know i can i can tell a family member yes i understand your
[3:14:05.600 --> 3:14:09.040]  your pain and all this other stuff that you're going through
[3:14:09.040 --> 3:14:13.440]  but the bottom line is the information is is out here
[3:14:13.440 --> 3:14:18.000]  for you to get it and in order to hold them accountable now the problem is
[3:14:18.000 --> 3:14:24.400]  as you eloquently stated in in past shows the majority of john q public
[3:14:24.400 --> 3:14:28.160]  has no idea how to access a government website
[3:14:28.160 --> 3:14:32.160]  and when they do access it they don't know how to read it because the words
[3:14:32.160 --> 3:14:36.480]  are so convoluted and misleading and they cannot connect the dots
[3:14:36.480 --> 3:14:40.320]  so they don't understand how a generally assembly general assembly
[3:14:40.320 --> 3:14:46.400]  um appropriations is going to affect their inmate and how it trickles down
[3:14:46.400 --> 3:14:49.280]  to their rank and file medical care out here
[3:14:49.280 --> 3:14:52.800]  because every time an inmate gets let loose and he's got
[3:14:52.800 --> 3:15:00.560]  hiv hcv tb mercer meningitis you name it every time they're released out here
[3:15:00.560 --> 3:15:05.120]  it is going to affect you next time you run through a fast food thing
[3:15:05.120 --> 3:15:10.240]  understand who's washing the dishes let's expand on that let's expand on that
[3:15:10.240 --> 3:15:14.240]  you see it in medical journals but you never see it in the news
[3:15:14.240 --> 3:15:17.840]  massive drug-resistant tb from the illegal aliens in the prisons infecting
[3:15:17.840 --> 3:15:21.840]  everybody massive illegal aliens well i understand it was just spreading it's
[3:15:21.840 --> 3:15:26.000]  spreading out to everybody but seven thousand cases of in one year
[3:15:26.000 --> 3:15:29.040]  alone there were no cases before that of what leprosy
[3:15:29.040 --> 3:15:32.640]  right there wait a little bit wait the the and gotta be really careful with
[3:15:32.640 --> 3:15:36.480]  these numbers and this is the other issue when you're when you're spouting off
[3:15:36.480 --> 3:15:39.360]  and i don't mean that the way it came out spouting off numbers about statistics
[3:15:39.360 --> 3:15:46.080]  with no i understand them um the majority of the statistical tracking
[3:15:46.080 --> 3:15:50.880]  when it is generated by the department of corrections or the bureau of justice
[3:15:50.880 --> 3:15:57.200]  it took this to task a couple of years ago the numbers are off it's worse
[3:15:57.200 --> 3:16:01.760]  they are not reporting for example prison desks
[3:16:01.760 --> 3:16:07.680]  to be an example if i've got an inmate xyz who um let's just suicide is an issue
[3:16:07.680 --> 3:16:11.120]  especially in your state but i'll just take suicide as an example
[3:16:11.120 --> 3:16:17.040]  um somebody is screaming in the cell block that inmate xyz has hung himself
[3:16:17.040 --> 3:16:21.440]  and they know that he is either in the process of or has already completed that
[3:16:21.440 --> 3:16:25.120]  task and these cellmates uh these inmates within the cell
[3:16:25.120 --> 3:16:28.080]  block may be screaming bloody murder at the top of their lungs for these
[3:16:28.080 --> 3:16:31.760]  correctional officers to get down there to see what's going on
[3:16:31.760 --> 3:16:35.040]  now i can i give you a case in point it took two and a half hours for
[3:16:35.040 --> 3:16:40.160]  correctional staff to get down to a unit in the clements
[3:16:40.160 --> 3:16:45.280]  um um i don't mean a cell unit in your state
[3:16:45.280 --> 3:16:50.880]  yes guy is clearly dead has been dead for hours
[3:16:50.880 --> 3:16:54.080]  and what the standard operating procedure for a department of correction
[3:16:54.080 --> 3:16:57.280]  staff is you never pronounce that inmate dead on site
[3:16:57.280 --> 3:17:02.240]  ever and if you do it's usually because a correctional
[3:17:02.240 --> 3:17:06.880]  officer is new at his job or he's he's panicking or he's nervous it's one of
[3:17:06.880 --> 3:17:10.320]  those three so what they'll do if if the cell
[3:17:10.320 --> 3:17:14.160]  block is already ad segg administrative segregation or solitary
[3:17:14.160 --> 3:17:17.920]  these guys are already locked down anyway if it isn't they're going to lock
[3:17:17.920 --> 3:17:21.040]  down the cell block and they're going to call medical
[3:17:21.040 --> 3:17:27.120]  medical does not necessarily show up in rapid and rapid pace time
[3:17:27.120 --> 3:17:31.360]  and they do that premeditatedly the first thing that majority of them will
[3:17:31.360 --> 3:17:34.720]  do is go to an inmate's file to see if they've got a dnr on file
[3:17:34.720 --> 3:17:39.680]  do not resuscitate order if medical staff sees that there is a dnr on file
[3:17:39.680 --> 3:17:43.680]  they're going to take their sweet time getting to that cell block
[3:17:43.680 --> 3:17:49.200]  because that dnr is their ticket to not having to treat him
[3:17:49.200 --> 3:17:52.400]  even if he had a 50-50 chance of making and that's why they're running the
[3:17:52.400 --> 3:17:56.640]  general public to sign these because now you could be helped at the hospital but
[3:17:56.640 --> 3:17:58.880]  the hospital wants 300 grand for your organs
[3:17:58.880 --> 3:18:02.240]  they don't give you treatment well but i don't want to get off
[3:18:02.240 --> 3:18:07.120]  point here so if i if you've got it if you've got an inmate that's got a dnr
[3:18:07.120 --> 3:18:10.800]  they're not going to show up in fast enough but they'll show up
[3:18:10.800 --> 3:18:13.920]  so the next thing that either the medical staff is going to call
[3:18:13.920 --> 3:18:18.400]  or the doc staff is going to call an ambulance ambulance is going to show
[3:18:18.400 --> 3:18:23.200]  up and these poor guys have no idea where they're going and they get
[3:18:23.200 --> 3:18:29.360]  into the cell block anywhere from 10 15 maybe 20 even 30 minutes later now if
[3:18:29.360 --> 3:18:33.440]  there's no dnr on file they're going to have to go ahead
[3:18:33.440 --> 3:18:36.800]  and perform life-saving measures which is what they always do
[3:18:36.800 --> 3:18:41.200]  so if all the commotion is heard in the cell block by these other inmates they
[3:18:41.200 --> 3:18:44.400]  are assuming that the guy is still alive although
[3:18:44.400 --> 3:18:48.400]  these inmates are not stupid they already know the guy is probably dead
[3:18:48.400 --> 3:18:51.920]  because they understand the doc personnel better than anybody
[3:18:51.920 --> 3:18:55.360]  so the guy is basically the dead inmate is in rigor mortis
[3:18:55.360 --> 3:19:00.560]  for example and paramedics are going to take him out of there as if he was
[3:19:00.560 --> 3:19:04.400]  alive and breathing and they're going to pronounce him dead either
[3:19:04.400 --> 3:19:09.600]  on the way to the hospital or at the hospital er and here's why i don't like
[3:19:09.600 --> 3:19:12.400]  the way they do this well it's a form of a form of covering up the
[3:19:12.400 --> 3:19:15.520]  deaths but go ahead well it's covering up the death and it's not attributed to
[3:19:15.520 --> 3:19:18.400]  the very facility where the death occurred and it's not attributed to the
[3:19:18.400 --> 3:19:22.240]  doc that's right they've been statistically and then when they
[3:19:22.240 --> 3:19:26.720]  have to do cause and manner of death it's always going to be in cases like this
[3:19:26.720 --> 3:19:29.280]  natural causes okay we got a break we got a break
[3:19:29.280 --> 3:19:33.760]  all right and so uh when we come back uh we're going to uh continue getting
[3:19:33.760 --> 3:19:37.600]  into this but i would just add really more than 15 000 us troops have died
[3:19:37.600 --> 3:19:41.200]  in iraq but now they changed the rules seven years ago
[3:19:41.200 --> 3:19:44.960]  before the war to where if you're flown out of the country to romstein in
[3:19:44.960 --> 3:19:48.880]  germany or the england of the us and you die a day later an hour later a
[3:19:48.880 --> 3:19:52.640]  month later from a hand grenade or a gunshot wound or
[3:19:52.640 --> 3:19:55.920]  whatever a mortar they don't count that as a death in the
[3:19:55.920 --> 3:19:59.520]  combat zone as a combat related deaths they say oh really
[3:19:59.520 --> 3:20:03.440]  only five thousand have died spring is here
[3:20:03.440 --> 3:20:07.680]  growing season the economy is not getting any better in fact it's getting

[3:21:14.160 --> 3:21:17.440]  the obama deception completely destroys the myth
[3:21:17.440 --> 3:21:20.640]  that obama is working for the best interest of the american people
[3:21:20.640 --> 3:21:25.120]  while obama's already fudging yeah fudged since day one in this election

[3:22:08.080 --> 3:22:13.040]  unfortunately with taxation the rising cost of food energy housing and medical
[3:22:13.040 --> 3:22:16.160]  many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line
[3:22:16.160 --> 3:22:19.600]  is this a flaw for enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the federal
[3:22:19.600 --> 3:22:22.160]  reserve note forcing us into perpetual debt
[3:22:22.160 --> 3:22:26.000]  ensuring inflation and higher taxes these questions and more can be answered
[3:22:26.000 --> 3:22:29.440]  by reading g edward griffin's book the creature from jekyll island

[3:24:06.880 --> 3:24:10.720]  now there's a million facets to this just from my own research
[3:24:10.720 --> 3:24:14.720]  this is what Karen Russo the wrongful death and injury institute does full
[3:24:14.720 --> 3:24:17.040]  time
[3:24:18.560 --> 3:24:22.720]  but we've gone the prison population in 1980 from a couple hundred thousand to
[3:24:22.720 --> 3:24:26.800]  four million and it just keeps going up and up and up
[3:24:26.800 --> 3:24:29.440]  more people in prison than any other country in the world not just per capita
[3:24:29.440 --> 3:24:34.240]  but period and you take the texas youth commission alone
[3:24:34.240 --> 3:24:41.040]  little kids junior high high school public rape rooms that all over the news
[3:24:41.040 --> 3:24:46.400]  just you know unbelievable numbers corruption nothing can stop them all
[3:24:46.400 --> 3:24:48.800]  the pedophiles that want to go be jail guards
[3:24:48.800 --> 3:24:52.560]  i mean it to even try to get into this it's just unbelievable
[3:24:52.560 --> 3:24:55.280]  but it isn't people say also what about those prisoners
[3:24:55.280 --> 3:24:58.480]  you know they're in hot tubs watching cable that's all lies
[3:24:58.480 --> 3:25:01.200]  what does this say about the establishment and about the government
[3:25:01.200 --> 3:25:06.320]  about i mean take two-thirds of foster children plus 67% nationwide are on
[3:25:06.320 --> 3:25:11.360]  more than one psychotropic drug and the state testified in texas is all over
[3:25:11.360 --> 3:25:13.840]  the country they said well they have bad gene pools
[3:25:13.840 --> 3:25:17.120]  with no science just well we just drug them because of this going back to
[3:25:17.120 --> 3:25:20.320]  Karen Russo Karen i want to get into the soy issue the diets i mean
[3:25:20.320 --> 3:25:24.000]  there's so many but just continue with whatever you think's most important
[3:25:24.000 --> 3:25:29.120]  and i'll hit on the diet um and i want to and i want to zero in on a couple of
[3:25:29.120 --> 3:25:32.320]  stats just so people can kind of get a handle on the numbers that we're talking
[3:25:32.320 --> 3:25:35.920]  about here we are the only country in the
[3:25:35.920 --> 3:25:39.520]  world that incarcerates as many human beings that is correct there are 2.3
[3:25:39.520 --> 3:25:43.120]  million folks locked up in a jail or a prison today
[3:25:43.120 --> 3:25:48.400]  5.1 million of in addition to that 2.3 million are on probation in parole
[3:25:48.400 --> 3:25:53.680]  that's a total of 7.4 million people now let me stop you i i saw cbs news last
[3:25:53.680 --> 3:25:56.640]  year said four million i'd always seen the two and a half million
[3:25:56.640 --> 3:25:59.920]  well i really think you can do with anything with statistics but it goes
[3:25:59.920 --> 3:26:04.480]  back and i'm a real stickler for this even with my clients
[3:26:04.480 --> 3:26:07.760]  statistics are statistics no no that's what i'm asking you because you study
[3:26:07.760 --> 3:26:10.960]  this what's the real number from your 2.3 million are locked up
[3:26:10.960 --> 3:26:14.960]  all right 5.1 are on probation in parole
[3:26:14.960 --> 3:26:21.600]  now total obviously 7.4 now my argument has always been when families are so
[3:26:21.600 --> 3:26:25.760]  exasperated as what to do which is there are a whole bunch of reasons why they
[3:26:25.760 --> 3:26:30.720]  don't know what to do but if you took 7.4 million and you and you
[3:26:30.720 --> 3:26:35.280]  average that each family had four family members
[3:26:35.280 --> 3:26:40.720]  each inmate had four family members that if you do the math that's 30 million
[3:26:40.720 --> 3:26:43.840]  people over 30 million people that are affected directly
[3:26:43.840 --> 3:26:48.160]  by incarceration and that number is 10 percent
[3:26:48.160 --> 3:26:52.960]  of the entire u.s population as it stands today which is 306 million
[3:26:52.960 --> 3:26:57.280]  now the reason i say that is that when families feel
[3:26:57.280 --> 3:27:03.440]  so um chastised or intimidated or put down
[3:27:03.440 --> 3:27:07.280]  um one of the biggest problems they have
[3:27:07.280 --> 3:27:11.680]  is not taking responsibility for the information that's available to them in
[3:27:11.680 --> 3:27:15.360]  order to fight and if they pulled their resources
[3:27:15.360 --> 3:27:18.480]  together and i don't necessarily mean finances
[3:27:18.480 --> 3:27:22.080]  but if they all got together under one
[3:27:22.080 --> 3:27:26.640]  um entity which is what we've been trying to do for the last 15 years
[3:27:26.640 --> 3:27:30.080]  and you became cohesive kind of like the mad
[3:27:30.080 --> 3:27:34.400]  organization was when they first started out yet two women literally
[3:27:34.400 --> 3:27:38.000]  sitting across from each other in a kitchen at a kitchen table drinking
[3:27:38.000 --> 3:27:42.320]  coffee and look what their efforts did a national
[3:27:42.320 --> 3:27:47.040]  organization that affected some really major changes within a very serious
[3:27:47.040 --> 3:27:50.800]  situation same thing applies here to this so that is
[3:27:50.800 --> 3:27:54.800]  one of the key issues that the numbers are there in order to affect
[3:27:54.800 --> 3:27:58.320]  some very major legislative changes in this country and in effect it would be
[3:27:58.320 --> 3:28:01.520]  the largest voting bloc in the history of the united states
[3:28:01.520 --> 3:28:05.600]  now what the politicians in each state doc don't want anybody to know
[3:28:05.600 --> 3:28:10.240]  is that fact and that's one of the key reasons why these inmates are
[3:28:10.240 --> 3:28:14.160]  disenfranchised they aren't stupid you know they understand
[3:28:14.160 --> 3:28:17.360]  how the system works they understand how these politicians work
[3:28:17.360 --> 3:28:21.440]  and they certainly understand what is said versus what is done to them
[3:28:21.440 --> 3:28:25.200]  especially when it comes to their medical health care
[3:28:25.200 --> 3:28:28.480]  and folks like you said will say oh well you know what the heck we don't
[3:28:28.480 --> 3:28:31.520]  why in the world do we have to pay for health care for inmates well you better
[3:28:31.520 --> 3:28:33.440]  pay for it because you're going to pay for it
[3:28:33.440 --> 3:28:36.800]  one way or the other you're either going to pay for it in taxes
[3:28:36.800 --> 3:28:40.640]  in a contract it's not doing their job or you're going to pay for it in medicated
[3:28:40.640 --> 3:28:43.920]  medicare regardless regardless you can't have the moral
[3:28:43.920 --> 3:28:46.320]  standing of not giving people proper health care
[3:28:46.320 --> 3:28:49.440]  because that creates an evil precedent in government for everybody
[3:28:49.440 --> 3:28:52.880]  well it's it's illegal for one thing it's it's
[3:28:52.880 --> 3:28:56.240]  all right that they get medical care so it's not even an argument anymore
[3:28:56.240 --> 3:28:59.280]  they're going to get it it's just a matter of how they're going to get it and
[3:28:59.280 --> 3:29:02.800]  how you know when is the light bulb going to go on to the general public
[3:29:02.800 --> 3:29:05.840]  that you're paying for actually paying for this
[3:29:05.840 --> 3:29:09.440]  and they're not being appropriated correctly and no one
[3:29:09.440 --> 3:29:13.520]  within the department of corrections or the contracted health care providers
[3:29:13.520 --> 3:29:17.920]  and there are over 60 of them operating in the united states today
[3:29:17.920 --> 3:29:21.840]  these contracted health care providers which are public or private
[3:29:21.840 --> 3:29:26.480]  are not being held accountable and it's clearly getting worse as society unravels
[3:29:26.480 --> 3:29:29.920]  uh there's no oversight i mean you know they can admit oh at dozens of
[3:29:29.920 --> 3:29:33.280]  locations they rape the children publicly in texas
[3:29:33.280 --> 3:29:37.600]  and uh that's just the way it is and oh at cps facilities from florida to
[3:29:37.600 --> 3:29:40.480]  michigan the kids sleep on monolium floors and
[3:29:40.480 --> 3:29:43.920]  bedsores in their own feces like russia they go oh that's just what
[3:29:43.920 --> 3:29:47.200]  government does so it's it's all part of a larger situation
[3:29:47.200 --> 3:29:51.280]  stay there let's talk about their diets when we come back
[3:29:52.080 --> 3:29:55.920]  we're on the march the empires on the run

[3:30:05.680 --> 3:30:09.840]  gcn has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants flowers and
[3:30:09.840 --> 3:30:13.200]  herbs it's called proto grow and it's so effective at producing rapid plant
[3:30:13.200 --> 3:30:16.320]  growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under
[3:30:16.320 --> 3:30:19.760]  practically any soil and like conditions now here's the best part for our
[3:30:19.760 --> 3:30:23.120]  listeners who garden for self-reliance proto grows unique blend of sea
[3:30:23.120 --> 3:30:26.800]  nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set
[3:30:26.800 --> 3:30:29.200]  creating maximum plant growth in minimum time
[3:30:29.200 --> 3:30:32.160]  proto grow works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to
[3:30:32.160 --> 3:30:34.960]  actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants
[3:30:34.960 --> 3:30:37.680]  proto grows full spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables
[3:30:37.680 --> 3:30:40.720]  with extraordinary taste enough to 10 times the nutritional value
[3:30:40.720 --> 3:30:44.320]  and if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass you can
[3:30:44.320 --> 3:30:47.440]  if you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids it's now

[3:33:33.600 --> 3:33:37.520]  and but a lot of shows this week i'm open the phones up and take a lot of calls
[3:33:37.520 --> 3:33:39.360]  i want to get back and take more calls but
[3:33:39.360 --> 3:33:41.760]  there's so many guests so much information we want to put out as well
[3:33:41.760 --> 3:33:46.240]  it's a catch 22 karen russo she's with the wrongful death and insury
[3:33:46.240 --> 3:33:50.560]  institute wrongful death institute dot com
[3:33:50.560 --> 3:33:54.080]  wrongful death institute dot com my website of course is info wars
[3:33:54.080 --> 3:34:00.160]  dot com uh... just a great tyranny going on in the prisons and the cps and
[3:34:00.160 --> 3:34:04.640]  uh... handicap people you name it i mean it's it's going all over the world this
[3:34:04.640 --> 3:34:07.280]  is what government does when the good people stop
[3:34:07.280 --> 3:34:10.400]  getting involved in an organized so before you leave get into how folks
[3:34:10.400 --> 3:34:13.680]  need to get organized and some of the powers they do have to rectify this
[3:34:13.680 --> 3:34:16.640]  because it only get worse if we don't but but let's get into some of the other
[3:34:16.640 --> 3:34:19.440]  horrors that folks are aware of turning over this rock
[3:34:19.440 --> 3:34:23.440]  the diet alone i got who cares what they will the diet's making them sick
[3:34:23.440 --> 3:34:26.720]  and then more money for health care explain that well
[3:34:26.720 --> 3:34:32.480]  um... the whole modus operandi behind the department of corrections is cost
[3:34:32.480 --> 3:34:35.920]  containment when you went when anybody goes to their
[3:34:35.920 --> 3:34:39.200]  government website and pulls up the department of corrections budget you're
[3:34:39.200 --> 3:34:42.080]  going to see a an astronomical amount
[3:34:42.080 --> 3:34:45.120]  that is probably one of the highest budgets
[3:34:45.120 --> 3:34:48.800]  within the state government that there will be is the doc budget
[3:34:48.800 --> 3:34:53.120]  so their whole um their whole goal is to contain cost
[3:34:53.120 --> 3:34:58.160]  whether it's health care uh medical services or food stuff
[3:34:58.160 --> 3:35:02.400]  um i don't think it's any news to any of your listening audience it sure isn't
[3:35:02.400 --> 3:35:05.760]  any news to the inmates that the food within a prison system is
[3:35:05.760 --> 3:35:12.000]  is about a d-minus or an f they suspect the inmates suspect that a lot of it
[3:35:12.000 --> 3:35:16.320]  um is contaminated a lot of them do get sick
[3:35:16.320 --> 3:35:22.880]  um a lot of prison facilities around the country have modified their
[3:35:22.880 --> 3:35:28.080]  dietary requirements to where some in uh some prisons
[3:35:28.080 --> 3:35:32.880]  don't even serve meat anymore um so you you have some issues there
[3:35:32.880 --> 3:35:36.560]  that that clearly affect health overall and one
[3:35:36.560 --> 3:35:40.320]  area that it affects tremendously is that of diabetes
[3:35:40.320 --> 3:35:44.080]  and i don't think it's any news to all of you too that diabetics
[3:35:44.080 --> 3:35:51.280]  have to really monitor what they eat prison is not conducive to diabetics
[3:35:51.280 --> 3:35:54.720]  um as such the majority of these individuals
[3:35:54.720 --> 3:35:59.680]  if they have outside family members that put money on their accounts
[3:35:59.680 --> 3:36:02.480]  which allow them to go to the commissary and buy
[3:36:02.480 --> 3:36:07.440]  other foods that are more conducive to maintaining their diabetic blood sugar
[3:36:07.440 --> 3:36:11.440]  levels um they will opt to go to a commissary
[3:36:11.440 --> 3:36:16.720]  rather than eat in the chat line for inmates that do not have anybody
[3:36:16.720 --> 3:36:19.760]  to put money on their accounts they are forced
[3:36:19.760 --> 3:36:25.280]  to eat the food in the prison and what that does they get extremely obese
[3:36:25.280 --> 3:36:29.040]  their blood sugar levels go off the charts the blood sugar levels in a
[3:36:29.040 --> 3:36:34.800]  prison setting the average is anywhere from 200 to 550
[3:36:34.800 --> 3:36:38.960]  and that is considered normal for state departments of correction
[3:36:38.960 --> 3:36:42.480]  medical health care units they don't even worry about it
[3:36:42.480 --> 3:36:47.440]  so if an inmate falls out from a coma or a diabetic coma
[3:36:47.440 --> 3:36:51.360]  um they're going to attribute it always in the medical record
[3:36:51.360 --> 3:36:55.120]  it's going to be the inmates fault for not maintaining a healthy and proper
[3:36:55.120 --> 3:36:59.120]  diet and it's a catch-22 it's not only a catch-22
[3:36:59.120 --> 3:37:02.400]  it's like putting these inmates and their families on a gerbil wheel
[3:37:02.400 --> 3:37:05.840]  you're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't and it's never going
[3:37:05.840 --> 3:37:08.400]  to be the prison's fault because they're like teflon
[3:37:08.400 --> 3:37:11.280]  they want nothing sticking on them and they're going to go out of their way
[3:37:11.280 --> 3:37:14.640]  to document that way but explain yeah through the bureaucracy explain
[3:37:14.640 --> 3:37:18.400]  people just the soy alone
[3:37:19.280 --> 3:37:26.880]  as a as a as a health care detriment yes well
[3:37:26.880 --> 3:37:30.400]  get me on a track you want me to go on because i'll i'll beer off and we'll
[3:37:30.400 --> 3:37:33.360]  miss the whole point well no no i mean i i've
[3:37:33.360 --> 3:37:36.160]  i just happen to know that more and more they're feeding them soy that has the
[3:37:36.160 --> 3:37:38.480]  estrogen mimickers that that's causing him to grow
[3:37:38.480 --> 3:37:42.640]  breast become very unhealthy and all the problems that that causes
[3:37:42.640 --> 3:37:45.680]  well it does but you know and here's the other thing and i
[3:37:45.680 --> 3:37:49.680]  well on the point of that if inmates suspect this
[3:37:49.680 --> 3:37:54.720]  and they have um they have verifiable proof or somebody's told them and you
[3:37:54.720 --> 3:37:58.960]  really don't even have to have proof all one has to do if i'm an
[3:37:58.960 --> 3:38:02.560]  inmate as i'm going to contact somebody on the outside preferably a family
[3:38:02.560 --> 3:38:05.600]  member and this is why family members become so
[3:38:05.600 --> 3:38:10.160]  important they have the skill and the ability
[3:38:10.160 --> 3:38:14.400]  and the information in front of them to go after these contracts
[3:38:14.400 --> 3:38:18.240]  these these prisons have contracts with everything
[3:38:18.240 --> 3:38:21.280]  nothing happens in that prison without a contract and the same thing goes for
[3:38:21.280 --> 3:38:24.720]  the food stuff so if somebody suspects that that that soy
[3:38:24.720 --> 3:38:28.560]  is being delivered to the inmate population at an unbelievable rate
[3:38:28.560 --> 3:38:32.720]  and the soy may be contaminated itself all one has to do is access the
[3:38:32.720 --> 3:38:37.040]  contract through the department of corrections and request a copy of it
[3:38:37.040 --> 3:38:42.400]  they have to give it to you so rather than have question marks around
[3:38:42.400 --> 3:38:45.600]  everything that happens with an inmate which is what we do with our with our
[3:38:45.600 --> 3:38:48.800]  clients and the family damn if you're telling me
[3:38:48.800 --> 3:38:52.480]  that your your loved ones suspect that we've got contaminated food on the
[3:38:52.480 --> 3:38:55.920]  shelf and they're being fed this and it hasn't changed in six months let's go
[3:38:55.920 --> 3:38:59.280]  get the contract and see if it has been let's explain why that happens a lot
[3:38:59.280 --> 3:39:02.640]  throughout history you've got big corporations that have jumped they can't
[3:39:02.640 --> 3:39:06.000]  sell the stores but they'll do little side deals or lots of corruption and
[3:39:06.000 --> 3:39:09.440]  payoffs have come out in the news and they'll sell it and foist it on the
[3:39:09.440 --> 3:39:13.280]  inmates sure they will and the same thing with medication
[3:39:13.280 --> 3:39:18.160]  if medications it's no news to inmates again
[3:39:18.160 --> 3:39:22.080]  that medications can be in the medical unit that are completely expired
[3:39:22.080 --> 3:39:25.600]  and they're using these medications all right let's go over this though in the
[3:39:25.600 --> 3:39:28.400]  time we have you brought up factor eight being a big issue
[3:39:28.400 --> 3:39:31.920]  knowing they had HIV and hepatitis letting them give the blood not once a
[3:39:31.920 --> 3:39:34.960]  month what they're supposed to but every week and then the
[3:39:34.960 --> 3:39:37.840]  somehow drugs are getting into the prison from the jail guards and others so
[3:39:37.840 --> 3:39:41.600]  there's a business within there's all they've got to sell as blood and then
[3:39:41.600 --> 3:39:44.720]  people get aids from it i mean this is insane
[3:39:44.720 --> 3:39:47.680]  and i'm sure in your all your research you've run into all the news reports
[3:39:47.680 --> 3:39:51.040]  about medical testing where these are ignorant inmates or they need money
[3:39:51.040 --> 3:39:54.000]  and they say oh we've got a medical experiments will do on you if you do
[3:39:54.000 --> 3:39:58.080]  this do you have anything on that or more on factor eight
[3:39:58.080 --> 3:40:02.800]  yes on the on the medical experiments and i don't i do not have the data in
[3:40:02.800 --> 3:40:05.680]  front of me to tell you statistics on that but
[3:40:05.680 --> 3:40:09.120]  in essence do they take place well i'm sure they do
[3:40:09.120 --> 3:40:13.520]  but in order to have that done inmates have got to sign off on stuff
[3:40:13.520 --> 3:40:16.080]  you know they're going to have to sign forms
[3:40:16.080 --> 3:40:20.640]  um and if they don't sign forms then that that's cause for alarm
[3:40:20.640 --> 3:40:24.240]  i'm going to i'm going to make a conjecture here that very few inmates
[3:40:24.240 --> 3:40:28.000]  are going to succumb to some kind of a medical experiment without signing a
[3:40:28.000 --> 3:40:30.640]  form no no they they have them do that but
[3:40:30.640 --> 3:40:34.400]  the food they can't eat so they say do this and we'll give you easy labor we'll
[3:40:34.400 --> 3:40:37.760]  give you a good food i mean that's that's come out in the news
[3:40:37.760 --> 3:40:43.120]  and i'm not gonna that's almost uh a wasted argument only from the standpoint
[3:40:43.120 --> 3:40:47.520]  is as i said before inmates aren't stupid they know how to live they know
[3:40:47.520 --> 3:40:50.480]  how to survive within a prison setting far beyond what any
[3:40:50.480 --> 3:40:54.160]  person out here in society knows how to do and we can't even imagine what they
[3:40:54.160 --> 3:40:58.000]  have to go through we can only guess because we're not going to be told
[3:40:58.000 --> 3:41:01.680]  and very few inmates want to talk about it so
[3:41:01.680 --> 3:41:05.440]  i'm real hesitant to say oh golly gee whiz the government's really taking
[3:41:05.440 --> 3:41:09.440]  advantage of these people um are they taking advantage of them
[3:41:09.440 --> 3:41:13.440]  maybe and not being transparent and forthcoming as to
[3:41:13.440 --> 3:41:17.120]  exactly what the medical testing is however
[3:41:17.120 --> 3:41:21.120]  these inmates can push the envelope to find out so if they really don't want
[3:41:21.120 --> 3:41:25.120]  to find out and they really don't care it could be even a form of suicide
[3:41:25.120 --> 3:41:28.720]  they just go well what i understand that but i mean here's an example i can
[3:41:28.720 --> 3:41:31.440]  pull up the headlines right now i covered them two weeks ago where they
[3:41:31.440 --> 3:41:36.080]  tell homeless people in europe uh this is a regular flu shot will pay
[3:41:36.080 --> 3:41:39.840]  a 200 euros to take it and they take it it's a bird flu
[3:41:39.840 --> 3:41:44.560]  experimental shot and they all die so there's lots of lying by big pharma
[3:41:44.560 --> 3:41:48.640]  well absolutely but see i think it goes back again
[3:41:48.640 --> 3:41:53.120]  people aren't thinking and people aren't asking questions you just don't
[3:41:53.120 --> 3:41:56.320]  don't take anybody's word for anything i tell my clients all the time
[3:41:56.320 --> 3:41:59.600]  if it's not documented and you don't have it in front of you in black and white
[3:41:59.600 --> 3:42:03.600]  but it ain't happening it doesn't exist and it's not happening
[3:42:03.600 --> 3:42:08.000]  and you've got to learn to zero in on facts and require facts from the very
[3:42:08.000 --> 3:42:11.840]  people that are trying to give them to you and don't take anybody's word for
[3:42:11.840 --> 3:42:14.880]  it until you get the same answer in three different places
[3:42:14.880 --> 3:42:18.720]  now uh the prison populations continuing to balloon
[3:42:18.720 --> 3:42:22.720]  um they are using the public schools kind of as induction centers into the
[3:42:22.720 --> 3:42:26.480]  prison institutionalization grid uh is there any
[3:42:26.480 --> 3:42:29.600]  view on when this is going to top off or how many it'll end up being we already
[3:42:29.600 --> 3:42:34.560]  have a record number i would um in every state
[3:42:34.560 --> 3:42:38.320]  due to the economy in your states one of them they're looking for ways to cut
[3:42:38.320 --> 3:42:42.960]  these inmates loose early they can't afford them
[3:42:42.960 --> 3:42:49.280]  um in your in your state for example um you the pew
[3:42:49.280 --> 3:42:53.440]  foundation is in in working on a deal with the
[3:42:53.440 --> 3:42:57.280]  texas department of corrections and your state politicians
[3:42:57.280 --> 3:43:01.120]  um trying to figure out ways to cut costs and let some of these
[3:43:01.120 --> 3:43:06.560]  inmates that are in there for petty crimes loose now the problem is in order
[3:43:06.560 --> 3:43:09.920]  to cut those costs the the board of probation and
[3:43:09.920 --> 3:43:14.240]  parole has got to come on board and agree with them and guess what your state
[3:43:14.240 --> 3:43:19.680]  board of probation and parole has said they're going to do nothing they are
[3:43:19.680 --> 3:43:22.080]  not going to they're not going to reroute their guidelines they're not
[3:43:22.080 --> 3:43:25.520]  going to change their guidelines so what that tells me because they're
[3:43:25.520 --> 3:43:29.840]  refusing to change the guidelines for release
[3:43:29.840 --> 3:43:33.760]  somebody in the statistical world is going to start as they always do
[3:43:33.760 --> 3:43:38.560]  determining in cycles when prisons need to be built when juvenile detention
[3:43:38.560 --> 3:43:41.680]  centers need to be built and when high schools need to be built
[3:43:41.680 --> 3:43:45.280]  because they're going to take a certain percentage of the population between a
[3:43:45.280 --> 3:43:50.400]  certain age group to determine when that population is going to hit that
[3:43:50.400 --> 3:43:56.160]  key mark of whether it's 17 to 22 or 17 to 23 when they have the the
[3:43:56.160 --> 3:44:01.040]  propensity to um offend the highest and we've had a baby
[3:44:01.040 --> 3:44:04.480]  bum they've had a baby bum determines when they're going to build these prisons
[3:44:04.480 --> 3:44:10.080]  i don't ever see i really don't ever see the prison population
[3:44:10.080 --> 3:44:13.920]  in the foreseeable future becoming less
[3:44:13.920 --> 3:44:16.880]  very fast that's right no matter what happens to the economy they're going to
[3:44:16.880 --> 3:44:20.800]  keep the peaceful pottage in there well that's exactly right and the
[3:44:20.800 --> 3:44:24.640]  and the lifers in there even if you've got life with the possibility of
[3:44:24.640 --> 3:44:28.320]  parole they don't want to cut these guys loose without these inmates in there
[3:44:28.320 --> 3:44:31.600]  they can't keep the doors open these prisoners are a commodity
[3:44:31.600 --> 3:44:35.680]  and prisons is big business it is big business you've got
[3:44:35.680 --> 3:44:39.200]  you've got you've got at least four prison hmo's
[3:44:39.200 --> 3:44:42.960]  that have got the corner on the market in the in the entire united states and
[3:44:42.960 --> 3:44:46.080]  it's only going to get better billions and so they're going to make more
[3:44:46.080 --> 3:44:49.360]  laws but more of us in prison uh and then feed us poison now
[3:44:49.360 --> 3:44:52.960]  now expanding on that you keep talking about your state your state we're on
[3:44:52.960 --> 3:44:56.240]  on many states all over the country but i am sitting in the capital of austin
[3:44:56.240 --> 3:45:00.320]  texas while while the uh legislatures in session
[3:45:00.320 --> 3:45:04.560]  and texas is for those that don't know that is the u.s is the
[3:45:04.560 --> 3:45:09.680]  capital of prisons uh but uh in the world but texas is the king
[3:45:09.680 --> 3:45:12.000]  uh... we have more presence who
[3:45:12.000 --> 3:45:16.480]  already is number one okay well i i i i guess a few years ago texas was still
[3:45:16.480 --> 3:45:20.720]  number one i i but i know texas brings people in from other states though i
[3:45:20.720 --> 3:45:23.520]  i've read many places that texas is number one
[3:45:23.520 --> 3:45:27.440]  well i'll just make the argument it's one or two
[3:45:27.440 --> 3:45:30.880]  it's just like the prison hmo's depending on the contracts and you just
[3:45:30.880 --> 3:45:35.920]  set it depending on how many outside inmates you're importing
[3:45:35.920 --> 3:45:39.200]  yeah with those numbers those two yeah with those numbers i believe texas is
[3:45:39.200 --> 3:45:42.800]  numerino i know a huge illegal alien influx in that crime
[3:45:42.800 --> 3:45:45.920]  wave in california that it may have grown past that whole another issue boy
[3:45:45.920 --> 3:45:50.720]  you've got that problem for sure and they're allowed to uh kill people and
[3:45:50.720 --> 3:45:53.280]  there's no extradition so they run back across the border
[3:45:53.280 --> 3:45:57.360]  so that's a lot of fun there uh and but to be the don't but they want to let
[3:45:57.360 --> 3:46:01.760]  those guys go got to keep the potheds in jail um so that continues there
[3:46:01.760 --> 3:46:04.880]  as the rocket attacks and car bombings intensify on the texas border
[3:46:04.880 --> 3:46:09.520]  specifically though um yeah i mean i know it's big business
[3:46:09.520 --> 3:46:11.760]  i'm sure you heard about the tuli in texas case
[3:46:11.760 --> 3:46:14.880]  where they grabbed 56 black people with no drugs or planted them on them and
[3:46:14.880 --> 3:46:18.240]  knew they were innocent to literally put them in the town prison because that
[3:46:18.240 --> 3:46:22.240]  was the only business yeah not uncommon
[3:46:22.240 --> 3:46:26.320]  it happens and it happens everywhere and this is the kind of stuff people are
[3:46:26.320 --> 3:46:29.040]  not aware of of course that they're people that happen to are aware of it
[3:46:29.040 --> 3:46:32.560]  but then when they say it everybody thinks they're nuts
[3:46:32.560 --> 3:46:36.720]  it's exactly what's happening it's exactly what's happening
[3:46:36.720 --> 3:46:40.240]  and they'll get they need the money you know without those inmates in there
[3:46:40.240 --> 3:46:43.600]  they can't open those doors and and people need to remember
[3:46:43.600 --> 3:46:46.880]  correctional staff doesn't run these prisons these inmates run it
[3:46:46.880 --> 3:46:50.800]  and god these inmates doing the work they don't stay awake
[3:46:50.800 --> 3:46:55.200]  and god forbid that we actually shut some prisons
[3:46:55.200 --> 3:46:58.320]  you know the factories can close everything else can go bankrupt all the
[3:46:58.320 --> 3:47:01.600]  shops can close but you will just have prisons and police and
[3:47:01.600 --> 3:47:04.560]  trips marching up and down the street and that's the new economy we're
[3:47:04.560 --> 3:47:08.080]  converting into that's pretty true that's pretty true and we
[3:47:08.080 --> 3:47:11.360]  haven't even hit on these prison hmo's these these managed health care
[3:47:11.360 --> 3:47:14.080]  companies yeah go over that like an hmo out here these
[3:47:14.080 --> 3:47:18.320]  these guys these corporations are just
[3:47:18.320 --> 3:47:23.360]  unrelentless they give the facade of health care
[3:47:23.360 --> 3:47:26.640]  without giving it and it's it they put roadblocks
[3:47:26.640 --> 3:47:30.720]  after roadblocks in front of these inmates and play with them
[3:47:30.720 --> 3:47:36.880]  as far as as what they're required to do in the prison system form wise
[3:47:36.880 --> 3:47:40.640]  and absolutely categorically premeditatedly denying them the
[3:47:40.640 --> 3:47:44.000]  adequate health care well i mean sending themselves with the v a's
[3:47:44.000 --> 3:47:47.680]  doing that and now obama's announced associated press that he wanted
[3:47:47.680 --> 3:47:51.200]  the troops to pay for their own health care oh yeah and you know
[3:47:51.200 --> 3:47:55.760]  um i i really i do believe if this health care thing
[3:47:55.760 --> 3:47:58.800]  pans out the way everybody says it's going to which i think is a real
[3:47:58.800 --> 3:48:02.960]  possibility i i wrote something a while back
[3:48:02.960 --> 3:48:05.760]  it says just prison health care for everybody because that's what it's
[3:48:05.760 --> 3:48:08.800]  going to end up like see i didn't read your writing but that's what i know
[3:48:08.800 --> 3:48:11.920]  everything is converting to this here's a aspirin for your heart attack
[3:48:11.920 --> 3:48:16.240]  here's your government right here's your government paid for health care
[3:48:16.240 --> 3:48:19.600]  and then the corporations just keep all the money that's their socialized
[3:48:19.600 --> 3:48:22.400]  health care yeah that's exactly right and and
[3:48:22.400 --> 3:48:26.000]  what we try to do with these families is you've got to learn how to document
[3:48:26.000 --> 3:48:30.080]  against these folks and that's what we do our our consulting is
[3:48:30.080 --> 3:48:33.520]  you've got to learn how to do it and to learn how to do it you're really
[3:48:33.520 --> 3:48:36.880]  going to have to commit your time and your resources
[3:48:36.880 --> 3:48:41.120]  um in order to fight for the inmate because they cannot do it on their own
[3:48:41.120 --> 3:48:44.080]  well my father's thought about even getting out of dentistry and roll surgery
[3:48:44.080 --> 3:48:47.840]  because with the new federal rules and all of it
[3:48:47.840 --> 3:48:51.040]  you know they have computers now just like the regular doctors
[3:48:51.040 --> 3:48:53.920]  yeah and the person has an h.m. or insurance
[3:48:53.920 --> 3:48:58.000]  it tells you what you can do and he says it's totally illegal he caused a big
[3:48:58.000 --> 3:49:02.320]  stink in his company and sent some letters to the state and you pointed out
[3:49:02.320 --> 3:49:06.400]  this is a violation of state law and federal law that the computers are
[3:49:06.400 --> 3:49:10.240]  practicing medicine now and then stopped it but but most the
[3:49:10.240 --> 3:49:13.920]  doctors and just bow down yes yes whatever the government says oh my god i
[3:49:13.920 --> 3:49:16.720]  love you mm-hmm well i really think that's what
[3:49:16.720 --> 3:49:20.080]  people are headed for and everybody that thought that obama's deal with such a
[3:49:20.080 --> 3:49:23.520]  great idea a lot of my clients fit that mold
[3:49:23.520 --> 3:49:27.280]  they're they're fast finding out that what they thought was bad health care
[3:49:27.280 --> 3:49:31.840]  is fixing to get a whole bunch worse and those inmates are going to get it
[3:49:31.840 --> 3:49:34.880]  worse than they already have it which is bad enough and we're going to get a
[3:49:34.880 --> 3:49:40.240]  taste of what they've been getting amazing it's an
[3:49:40.240 --> 3:49:44.240]  absolutely unbelievable and the prescription drug companies are right
[3:49:44.240 --> 3:49:47.120]  up there with them and you're right when you
[3:49:47.120 --> 3:49:51.280]  said in your comment earlier if they can drug these guys up 23 out of 24
[3:49:51.280 --> 3:49:55.600]  it's a lot easier to manage them and then when they get cut loose when they get
[3:49:55.600 --> 3:49:59.520]  released they're handed basically a ziplock bag of psychotropic
[3:49:59.520 --> 3:50:03.520]  and prescription drugs that they cannot afford so when they run out of that
[3:50:03.520 --> 3:50:06.880]  ziplock bag the only thing they know to do since they've been
[3:50:06.880 --> 3:50:10.320]  become courtesy of your state doc and your prison
[3:50:10.320 --> 3:50:14.400]  health care contract prescription drug addicts the only thing that they know to
[3:50:14.400 --> 3:50:18.080]  do is get the money in order to get the drugs that they have got to be on and
[3:50:18.080 --> 3:50:24.320]  there we go with the revolving door and that's by design just amazing
[3:50:24.320 --> 3:50:26.720]  we're going to come back in a final segment with you and tell folks how they
[3:50:26.720 --> 3:50:29.680]  can get involved with you support you learn how to defend themselves learn
[3:50:29.680 --> 3:50:33.680]  how to fight this corrupt system on the other side of this

[3:52:06.000 --> 3:52:10.480]  barack obama is the tip of the spear we've got to give them a stake
[3:52:10.480 --> 3:52:14.080]  in creating the kind of uh world order that i think all of us would like to
[3:52:14.080 --> 3:52:17.520]  say the obama deception completely destroys the
[3:52:17.520 --> 3:52:21.200]  myth that obama is working for the best interest of the american people
[3:52:21.200 --> 3:52:25.680]  while obama's already fudging yeah fudged since day one in this election
[3:52:25.680 --> 3:52:29.920]  if you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[3:52:29.920 --> 3:52:33.600]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme

[3:56:08.960 --> 3:56:13.680]  people finally want the gloves to come off uh the groups that uh no doubt will

[3:56:30.560 --> 3:56:35.200]  uh so just everybody's on notice for that and uh this other stuff but i have to
[3:56:35.200 --> 3:56:37.520]  continue i'm like let's become a big distraction or diversion from everything
[3:56:37.520 --> 3:56:40.320]  we're doing you know with my guests you know what i'm talking about only folks
[3:56:40.320 --> 3:56:43.200]  that know about this will be aware of it i'm not going to discuss it
[3:56:43.200 --> 3:56:46.960]  any further uh may not be on the air a few days this week because i've got to go
[3:56:46.960 --> 3:56:50.400]  prepare the suits that's been done properly with law firms it takes a lot
[3:56:50.400 --> 3:56:54.080]  of time a lot of energy to do it right and uh so that's it a lot of mental
[3:56:54.080 --> 3:56:57.200]  a lot of mental illness out there and i've got to counter it defend my family

[3:57:04.320 --> 3:57:08.160]  about the institute you run and people trying to get their rights back how do
[3:57:08.160 --> 3:57:11.440]  they do that they can um contact us through the
[3:57:11.440 --> 3:57:15.280]  website which you've graciously given them and they can call us at eight one
[3:57:15.280 --> 3:57:20.160]  six nine four one zero zero eight seven um i really would encourage them
[3:57:20.160 --> 3:57:24.240]  families especially if you've got a loved one in prison to contact us because
[3:57:24.240 --> 3:57:28.000]  there are certain documents that you need to have on
[3:57:28.000 --> 3:57:33.680]  file in order to fight for that inmate that 95 of them do not have on file
[3:57:33.680 --> 3:57:37.280]  and if you've got generated in uh generated forms
[3:57:37.280 --> 3:57:41.040]  from the prison system that you think are there for that reason
[3:57:41.040 --> 3:57:46.000]  i can almost bet you they are not uh they're not accurate
[3:57:46.000 --> 3:57:49.840]  and they're not adequate so i would encourage them to do that the other
[3:57:49.840 --> 3:57:53.440]  way they can learn about it um there's a book coming out
[3:57:53.440 --> 3:57:57.920]  that i've written at the beginning of the summer called fighting for life
[3:57:57.920 --> 3:58:02.640]  that it basically teaches families how to do uh basically 20 years of what i'm
